In  humans,  the  ingestion  of  the  combination  of  two  or  more  serotonin  (5-HT)-enhancing  drugs  but  also
of a  single  drug  in  overdose  can  induce  serious  adverse  effects,  which  are  characteristics  of  the  serotonin
syndrome (SS).  In  mice,  acute  administration  of  direct  and  indirect  5-HT  agonists  also  leads  to  behavioral
and autonomic  responses,  but  in  literature  different  responses  are  thought  to  be  essential.  In  order  to
detect common  behavioral  SS  responses  induced  by  5-HT-enhancing  drugs  with  different  mechanisms  of
action, we  investigated  the  effects  of  the  5-HT  precursor  5-hydroxy- l-tryptophan  (5-HTP),  the  selective
serotonin reuptake  inhibitor  (SSRI)  ﬂuoxetine  (FLX),  and  the  monoaminooxidase  (MAO)  inhibitor  tranyl-
cypromine (TCP)  in  male  NMRI  mice.  The  drugs  were  administered  alone  or  in  combination  to  investigate
additive effects  or  drug  potentiation.  Moreover,  we  compared  the  5-HT  responses  to  the  effects  induced
by the  dopamine,  noradrenaline,  and  cholinergic  agonists,  apomorphine  (APO),  atomoxetine  (ATO),  and
oxotremorine (OXO).  Our  results  show  that  the  studied  5-HT-enhancing  drugs  induced  a  different  num-
ber of  concomitant  responses.  The  following  ﬁve  responses  consistently  and  dose-dependently  occurred
in NMRI  mice:  ﬂat  body  posture,  hindlimb  abduction,  piloerection,  tremor,  and  decreased  rearings.  Like
in humans,  the  combination  of  5-HT-enhancing  drugs  leads  to  a  potentiation  of  drug  effects.  With  the
exception of  ﬂat  body  posture  the  responses  are  not  speciﬁc  for  serotonergic  hyperactivity.  The  ﬁndings
demonstrate that  the  SS  in  NMRI  mice  is  a  suitable  animal  model  for  preclinical  research,  if  it  is  taken  into
account that  the  spectrum  of  typical  responses  to  5-HT  enhancing  drugs  may  differ  depending  on  drug
and mouse  strain  and  that  some  responses  might  be  evoked  by  activation  of  other  transmission  systems,
too.

In  humans,  the  serotonin  syndrome  (SS)  is  a  potentially  life
threatening  disorder,  induced  by  drugs  raising  the  activity  of  the
serotonergic  transmission  system.  An  SS  usually  develops  when
two  drugs,  which  increase  extracellular  concentration  of  serotonin
(5-HT)  or  act  as  an  agonist  at  5-HT  receptors,  are  ingested  together.
However,  it  can  also  be  induced  by  single  drug  use  in  overdose.
The  symptomatology  of  the  SS  in  man  includes  a  triad  of  motor
symptoms  (e.g.  myoclonus,  tremor),  autonomic  responses  (e.g.
hyperthermia,  tachycardia),  and  altered  mental  state  (e.g.  agitation,
confusion;  see  [1,2] ).

In  laboratory  rodents,  a  syndrome  of  serotonergic  hyperactiv-
ity  can  be  evoked  by  the  same  drugs  and  drug  combinations  as  in
man  [see  3,4] .  A  prerequisite  for  the  translational  application  of  the
murine  SS  as  a  preclinical  screening  test  for  unwanted  drug  effects
is  to  evaluate  the  predictive  validity  of  the  assessed  responses  and
their  speciﬁcity.
In  mice,  several  responses  of  motor  and  autonomic  systems  have
been  reported  following  the  administration  of  5-HT-enhancing
drugs  or  direct  5-HT  agonists  [see  3,4] .  However,  it  is  still  a  mat-
ter  of  debate  which  responses  are  essential  to  determine  the
SS  in  mice  [4–7] .  Different  authors  consider  different  responses
as  relevant  and  do  not  make  use  of  the  same  spectrum  of
responses  [e.g.  3,5,7,8,9–11] .  In  order  to  examine  which  signs
can  be  reliably  provoked  in  a  typical  outbred  mouse  strain,  we
systematically  investigated  the  effects  of  three  5-HT-enhancing
drugs  with  different  mechanisms  of  action,  i.e.  the  5-HT  precur-
sor  5-hydroxtryptophan  (5-HTP),  the  selective  serotonin  reuptake
inhibitor  (SSRI) ﬂuoxetine (FLX),  and  the  unspeciﬁc  monoamine
oxidase  (MAO)  inhibitor  tranylcypromine  (TCP),  given  alone  and
in combination, in  NMRI  mice.  The  spectrum  of  the  examined
behavioral  signs  included  fourteen  responses  that  were  fre-
quently reported in  literature  and  can  concomitantly  be  assessed
[3,5,7,12] .
The second aim  of  this  study  was  to  characterize  the  interaction
of  5-HT-enhancing  drugs,  i.e.  to  clarify  if  the  effect  of  two  5-HT-
enhancing  drugs  concurrently  administered  is  an  additive  one  or
a  drug  potentiation  effect.  It  is  known  from  clinical  studies  that
combined  ingestion  of  two  5-HT-enhancing  drugs  with  different
mechanisms  of  action  in  therapeutic  doses  are  more  likely  to  elicit
an  5-HT  toxidrome,  suggesting  a  potentiation  of  unwanted  drug
effects  [13,14] .  In  animal  studies  the  “5-HTP  potentiated  behavioral
syndrome”  [15]  and  the  behavioral  syndrome  after  “tryptophan
loading”  [16]  are  examples  for  presumed  potentiation  effects  in  rats
and  mice.  However,  in  these  studies,  5-HTP  or  tryptophan  were
given  in  sub-effective  doses.  In  our  study  combinations  of  5-HT-
enhancing  drugs  in  mild  effective  doses  were  used  enabling  us  to
analyze  drug  interactions.
In  laboratory  rodents,  dopamine  and  noradrenaline  agonists  as
well  as  parasympathomimetics  also  induce  motor  and  autonomic
effects, which  are  known  to  resemble  some  of  the  SS  responses.
The  third  aim  of  our  study  in  NMRI  mice  was  hence  to  clarify
which  distinct  responses  to  5-HT-enhancing  drugs  are  speciﬁc
and  which  coincide  with  responses  to  agonists  at  dopamine,  nor-
adrenaline,  and  acetylcholine  receptors.  Therefore,  we  studied  the
effects  induced  by  the  dopamine  receptor  agonist  apomorphine
(APO),  the  noradrenaline  reuptake  inhibitor  atomoxetine  (ATO),
and  the  unspeciﬁc  muscarinic  receptor  agonist  oxotremorine
(OXO).
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
Male NMRI  mice  (HsdWin:NMRI)  at  an  age  of  10  weeks  were
used  in  all  experiments.  The  mice  (n  =  12–14  per  group)  were
obtained from  Harlan–Winkelmann  (Horst,  Netherlands)  and  were
habituated  in  the  animal  facility  for  at  least  two  weeks.  The  mice
were pair-housed  under  standardized  conditions  (23  ±  2◦C  room
temperature,  50  ±  5%  humidity)  with  an  artiﬁcial  12/12  h  light/dark
cycle  (lights  on  06.00–18.00  h,  illumination  strength  ca.  250  lx).
Food  (Altromin  1326,  Lage,  Germany)  and  tap  water  were  available
ad  libitum .  Experiments  were  performed  according  to  the  guide-
lines of  the  German  Animal  Protection  Law  and  were  approved
by  the  Berlin  State  Authority  (“Landesamt  für  Gesundheit  und
Soziales”).2.2.  Drug  treatment
Fluoxetine  (FLX;  European  Directorate  for  the  Qual-
ity  of  Medicines  &  HealthCare  (EDQM)),  tranylcypromine
(TCP;  (±)-trans -2-phenylcyclopropan-1-amine  hydrochloride;
Sigma–Aldrich),  apomorphine  (APO;  (R)-5,6,6a,7-tetrahydro-6-
methyl-4H-dibenzo[de,g]quinolone-10,11-diol  hydrochloride;
Tocris  Bioscience),  oxotremorine  (OXO;  1-[4-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-
2-butynyl]-2-pyrrolidinone  sesquifumarate;  Sigma–Aldrich),
and  atomoxetine  (ATO;  (R)-N-methyl- /H9253-(2-methylphenoxy)-
benzenepropanamine  hydrochloride;  Tocris  Bioscience)  were
freshly  dissolved  in  0.9%  saline.  5-hydroxy- l-tryptophan  (5-HTP;
Sigma–Aldrich)  was  freshly  prepared  as  a  suspension  in  0.9%
saline  with  1%  Cremophor  EL.  All  drugs  and  vehicle  were  injected
intraperitoneally  (i.p.)  at  a  volume  of  10  ml/kg  body  weight.
2.2.1. Experiment  1
In  order  to  investigate  SS  responses  after  single  drug  admin-
istration the  following  dose  ranges  were  used  based  on  previous
studies  [7,10] :  for  5-HTP  80,  160,  and  320  mg/kg,  for  FLX  10,  20,
and  40  mg/kg,  and  for  TCP  1,  2,  and  4  mg/kg.  For  ethical  reasons,
the  doses  of  these  drugs  were  below  the  lethal  one.  The  maximal
doses  we  have  chosen  for  5-HTP,  FLX,  and  TCP  were  about  1/4–1/3
of  the  respective  LD50  administered  i.p.  in  mice  [17–19] .  Since  no
signiﬁcant differences  were  observed,  the  vehicle  groups  for  5-HTP,
FLX  and  TCP  (n  =  5,  5,  and  4,  respectively)  were  pooled  to  one  control
group.
2.2.2. Experiment  2
For the  investigation  of  drug  interactions  we  concomitantly
administered  5-HTP  with  FLX,  FLX  with  TCP,  and  5-HTP  with  TCP  in
their  minimal  effective  dose  obtained  by  Experiment  1,  i.e.  80  mg/kg
5-HTP,  10  mg/kg  FLX,  and  2  mg/kg  TCP  respectively.  All  drug  com-
binations  were  administered  as  one  injection.
2.2.3.  Experiment  3
The doses  of  APO  (4  mg/kg),  OXO  (0.5  mg/kg),  and  ATO  (2  mg/kg)
were  chosen  according  to  Lau  et  al.  [20]  and  Maehara  et  al.  [21]  and
to  our  own  experience.
2.3. Behavioral test
The  mice  were  transferred  to  the  experimental  room  12  h  prior
to  the  beginning  of  the  experiment.  On  the  following  day  between
08.00  and  12.00  h,  the  experiments  were  carried  out  in  a  sound
attenuated  chamber.  For  each  90  min  trial  four  mice  were  tested
at  the  same  time.  Immediately  after  drug  or  vehicle  injection,  each
mouse  was  placed  in  the  center  of  a  black  painted  Makrolon  type  II
cage (260  mm  ×  200  mm  ×  140  mm)  and  its  behavior  was  evaluated
by  an  observer  blind  to  drug  treatment.  Between  each  trail,  the
cages were  cleaned  with  a  solution  of  water  and  detergent.
The  assessment  method  for  the  SS  responses  was  adapted
from previous  studies  [7,9,10] .  Beginning  5  min  post-injection,  the
occurrence  of  the  following  SS  responses  was  assessed  every  5  min
for  1  min  by  instantaneous  sampling  and  was  rated  as  present  (=1)
or  absent  (=0):
•Flat body  posture  (the  greater  ventral  part  of  the  body  is  in  con-
tact  with  the  cage  ﬂoor  and  the  animal  moves  similar  to  a  reptile.
To  our  experience  ﬂat  body  posture  is  often  accompanied  by
hindlimb  abduction)
•Head  weaving  (repetitive  movement  of  the  head  from  side  to  side,
like  watching  a  tennis  match)
•Hindlimb
 abduction  (both  hindlimbs  are  splaying  out  to  the  side.
Toes  of  the  distal  limb  are  also  often  splayed  out.)206  R.  Haberzettl  et  al.  /  Behavioural  Brain  Research  277  (2015)  204–210
•Tremor
 (shivering  encompassing  the  whole  body  at  rest)
•Straub  tail  (a  rigid  dorsiﬂexed  tail  in  a  sharper  angle  at  the  base
of  the  tail)
•Backward  walking  (the  animal  continuously  moves  backwards
for  some  cm)
•Hunched  back  (dorsal  arching  of  the  spine  relative  to  a  line
between  the  neck  and  the  rump  with  distinctive  ﬂexion  of  the
back  muscles)
•Piloerection (erected  body  hair,  most  prominent  in  the  region  of
the  neck)
•Head  shakes  (short  and  ﬁrm  movement  of  the  head  in  any  direc-
tion  comparable  to  the  Pinna  reﬂex  reaction)
•Forepaw  treading  (the  animal  is  at  rest  and  moves  the  forepaws
alternating  and  repetitively)
•Head  twitches  (jerky  movements  of  the  head  only  toward  the
neck).
Additionally, as  a  measure  for  vertical  activity  the  number  of
rearings  (i.e.  both  forepaws  lifted  off  the  cage  ﬂoor)  was  counted
every  5  min  for  1  min.  At  the  end  of  the  experiment,  the  animals
were  removed  from  the  cage  and  the  occurrence  of  salivation,  rated
as  present  (=1)  or  absent  (=0),  was  determined  by  closely  examin-
ing  the  muzzle  of  the  mice  for  patches  of  damp  fur.  Moreover,  the
number  of  defecation  boli  in  the  experimental  cage  was  counted.
The  occurrence  of  any  other  effect  mentioned  in  literature,  e.g.
myoclonic  seizures  [22] ,  was  also  registered  by  the  observer.
Horizontal  motor  activity  was  not  determined  because  of  the
restricted  area  of  the  observation  cages.  Drug  effects  on  rectally
recorded  body  temperature  were  not  included  in  this  study  as  it
would  have  interfered  with  the  behavioral  observation.
2.4.  Statistical  analysis
Since  no  signiﬁcant  behavioral  changes  were  detected  in  the  last
30  min  (60–90  min),  we  only  analyzed  the  data  of  the  ﬁrst  60  min
(0–60 min),  resulting  in  12  assessment  points.  The  scores  measured
by  instantaneous  sampling  were  summed  up  for  each  a  mouse  with
a  possible  maximum  value  of  12  for  each  response.  The  number  of
rearings  was  summed  up  over  the  12  assessment  points.  For  all
treatment  groups  the  means  ±  SEM  for  each  response  were  calcu-
lated,  except  for  salivation.  Sign  of  salivation  were  only  observed
in  the  OXO  group  and  appeared  there  in  all  animals.  Hence,  for
salivation  descriptive  statistics  were  used.
In  order  to  detect  dose  response  effects  (Experiment  1)  or  treat-
ment  effects  (Experiments  2  and  3),  the  data  were  analyzed  using
one-way  ANOVAs  followed  by  post  hoc  Dunnett’s  tests  in  compar-
ison  to  vehicle.
In  order  to  investigate  the  synergistic  effect  of  the  drug  combi-
nations,  we  calculated  the  respective  sums  of  the  single  drug  effects
for each  SS  response  and  analyzed  the  data  by  Mann–Whitney- U-
tests.  For  all  tests  a  probability  value  of  0.05  was  considered  to  be
statistically  signiﬁcant.  In  Tables  1–3 ,  only  those  SS  responses  are
shown  where  signiﬁcant  differences  were  detected.
3.  Results
3.1.  Experiment  1
5-HTP.  Out  of  all  three  drugs,  5-HTP  induced  the  broadest
spectrum  of  SS  responses.  Post  hoc  analysis  revealed  that,  in  com-
parison  to  vehicle,  the  higher  doses  of  5-HTP  (i.e.  160  mg/kg  and
320  mg/kg)  signiﬁcantly  increased  the  occurrence  of  the  following
seven  responses:  ﬂat  body  posture,  hindlimb  abduction,  piloerec-
tion,  tremor,  forepaw  treading,  head  twitches,  and  hunched  back
(see  Table  1).  Additionally,  both  doses  signiﬁcantly  decreased  the

numbers of  rearings  (Table  1).  At  the  lowest  dose  (80  mg/kg),  5-HTP
increased  the  occurrence  of  piloerection  and  head  twitches  and  also
the  number  of  defecation  boli,  whereas  the  number  of  rearings  was
signiﬁcantly  decreased  (Table  1).
FLX.  In  comparison  to  5-HTP,  less  responses  were  evoked
by  FLX  treatment.  Compared  to  vehicle,  the  administration  of
20  mg/kg  and  40  mg/kg  FLX  induced  signiﬁcant  increases  only  in
the  following  ﬁve  SS  responses,  ﬂat  body  posture,  hindlimb  abduc-
tion  (although  only  signiﬁcant  when  treated  with  20  mg/kg  FLX),
piloerection,  tremor,  and  hunched  back  (Table  1).  In  addition,
signiﬁcant  decreases  were  revealed  for  number  of  rearings  and
defecation  boli  (Table  1).  At  the  lowest  dose  (10  mg/kg),  FLX  only
induced an increase  in  the  occurrence  of  hunched  back  (Table  1).
TCP.  Of  the  three  drugs,  TCP  elicited  the  fewest  number  of  SS
responses.  At  the  highest  dose  (4  mg/kg),  TCP  only  induced  sig-
niﬁcant  increases  in  the  occurrence  of  ﬂat  body  posture,  hindlimb
abduction,  piloerection,  and  tremor,  and  additionally  it  decreased
the  number  of  rearings  (Table  1).  Treatment  with  2  mg/kg  TCP
signiﬁcantly  enhanced  the  occurrence  of  hindlimb  abduction
(p  <  0.001)  and  piloerection  (p  <  0.001),  whereas  1  mg/kg  TCP  had
no  signiﬁcant  effects  on  the  assessed  responses  (Table  1).
Comparing  all  three  single  drug  treatments,  the  following  ﬁve
responses  were  consistently  observed:  ﬂat  body  posture,  hindlimb
abduction,  piloerection,  tremor,  and  decreased  rearings.  Backward
walking,  head  shakes,  head  weaving,  salivation,  and  Straub  tail  did
not  occur  after  treatment  with  5-HTP,  FLX  and  TCP  in  NMRI  mice
in  any  of  the  used  doses  (data  not  shown).
3.2.  Experiment  2
The  minimal  effective  dose  of  each  drug  was  used  for  inves-
tigating  drug  interaction,  i.e.  the  doses,  derived  by  Experiment  1,
which  induced  at  least  one  SS  response.  5-HTP  at  80  mg/kg  evoked
four  responses,  10  mg/kg  FLX  induced  one  and  2  mg/kg  TCP  two
responses  (see  Table  1).  All  three  drug  combinations  increasedthe number  of  SS  responses  and  at  least  the  ﬁve  aforementioned
responses  (i.e.  ﬂat  body  posture,  hindlimb  abduction,  piloerection,
tremor,  and  a  decrease  in  rearings)  were  observed  (see  Table  2).  5-

additionally  induced  an  increase  in  forepaw  treading  and  head
twitches  and  a  decrease  of  defecation  boli  (Table  2).
FLX  +  TCP .  The  combination  of  10  mg/kg  FLX  with  2  mg/kg  TCP
induced  no  further  SS  responses  than  the  ﬁve  aforementioned  SS
responses  (see  Table  2).
5-HTP  +  TCP.  After  administration  of  5-HTP  (80  mg/kg)  and  TCP
(2  mg/kg)  the  broadest  spectrum  of  responses  was  observed.  In
addition  to  the  ﬁve  aforementioned  SS  responses  forepaw  treading,
head twitches, hunched  back,  and  an  increased  number  of  defeca-
tion  boli  occurred  (see  Table  2).
Likewise  to  the  single  treatments,  all  three  combinations  had  no
signiﬁcant  effects  on  backward  walking,  head  shakes  and  weaving,
salivation  and  Straub  tail  (data  not  shown).
In  order  to  characterize  the  synergism  of  the  drug  combina-
tions,  the  effects  were  compared  to  the  respective  addition  of  sum
scores/numbers  of  the  single  drugs  (see  Table  2).  Arithmetically,
the  sum  scores/numbers  for  seven  SS  responses  of  the  5-HTP  +  FLX
combination  were  signiﬁcantly  higher  than  the  respective  sums  of
the  single  drug  effects.  Also,  sum  scores/numbers  of  the  5-HTP  +  TCP
combination  exceeded  the  sums  of  the  single  drug  effects  in  case
of  six  SS  responses.  The  over-additive  effect  of  the  FLX  +  TCP  com-
binations  was  not  as  pronounced:  only  the  sum  scores/numbers  of
three  SS  responses  differed  from  the  sums  of  the  single  drug  effects
(see  Table  2).
3.3. Experiment 3
Following the treatment  with  the  noradrenaline  agonist  ATO
only  two  of  the  ﬁve  common  SS  responses  in  NMRI  mice,  i.e.
hindlimb  abduction  and  piloerection,  were  observed  (Table  3).
The  administration  of  the  dopamine  agonist  APO  also  increased

hindlimb  abduction  and  piloerection.  Additionally,  APO  decreased
the  number  of  rearings  (see  Table  3).  The  most  responses  in
this  experiment  were  induced  by  the  acetylcholine  agonist  OXO.
The  administration  of  OXO  increased  the  occurrence  of  hindlimb
abduction,  piloerection,  and  tremor,  and  decreased  the  number  of
rearings  (Table  3).  For  the  ﬁrst  time  salivation  was  observed,  which
was  displayed  in  all  13  animals  treated  with  OXO.  Moreover,  the
administration  of  APO  and  OXO  induced  in  some  animals  the  Straub
tail  response  (sum  scores  for  APO:  1.43  ±  0.64,  for  OXO:  2.00  ±  0.62;
p  =  0.002  vs  vehicle:  0.00  ±  0.00).
Of  the  ﬁve  common  SS  responses  induced  by  5-HT-enhancing
drugs  in  NMRI  mice,  ﬂat  body  posture  was  not  evoked  by  ATO,  APO,
or  OXO.  Also,  backward  walking,  changes  in  defecation,  forepaw
treading,  hunched  back,  head  twitches,  head  weaving  and  head
shakes  were  not  observed  (data  not  shown).
4. Discussion
In literature, ﬂat body  posture,  hindlimb  abduction,  tremor,
head  weaving,  backward  walking,  Straub  tail,  and  hyperactivity  are
the  most frequently reported  signs  for  describing  the  SS  in  mice  [see
3].  Head  twitches  and  decrease  in  body  temperature  are  also  often
referred to as signs  of  serotonergic  hyperactivity  [3].  In  order  to
prove, whether  this  spectrum  of  signs  is  reliably  induced  by  dif-
ferent 5-HT-enhancing drugs  we  investigated  the  effects  of  5-HTP,
FLX,  and  TPH  on  the  behavioral  SS  responses  in  male  NMRI  mice.
The selected drugs  increase  the  extracellular  5-HT  concentration
by  different  mechanisms  of  action  and  have  been  frequently  used
to  evoke  SS  responses  in  rodents  [7,10,23–25] .
In  our  study,  we  observed  in  NMRI  mice  ﬁve  common  signs
that  were  induced  by  all  three  5-HT-enhancing  drugs,  i.e.  ﬂat  body
posture,  hindlimb  abduction,  tremor,  piloerection,  and  decrease
in  rearing.  Likewise  to  humans,  where  the  symptoms  of  the  SS
are  thought  to  be  a  continuous  spectrum  from  side-effects  to  tox-
icity  [26] ,  the  severity  and  number  of  responses  increased  with
ascending  dosage.  Although,  the  spectrum  of  signs  is  conﬁrmed
by  other  murine  SS  studies  [5,7–10,15,27] ,  it  only  partially  over-
laps  with  the  most  frequently  reported  responses.  Most  likely,
strain differences  contribute  to  the  diverging  spectrum  of  signs
as  it  was  previously  shown  that  the  intensity  of  head  weaving
and  hindlimb  abduction  induced  by  the  5-HT  precursor  tryptamine
can  differ  between  mouse  strains  due  to  different  tryptamine  con-
centrations  in  the  brain  [28] .  Also  the  pharmacodynamics  of  the
serotonergic  drugs  can  inﬂuence  the  range  of  evoked  behavioral  SS
responses.  In  this  study,  the  used  drugs  increase  extracellular  5-HT
concentration  and  therefore  activate  all  5-HT  receptors.  Hence,  it
is  conceivable  that  distinct  behavioral  responses  might  occur  more
pronounced  if  only  speciﬁc  5-HT  receptor  subtypes  are  stimulated.
In  the  same  mouse  strain,  for  example,  we  observed  a  rigid  tail
(also  known  as  Straub  tail  or  spontaneous  tail  ﬂick  response)  when
the  full  5-HT 1A-receptor  agonist  8-OH-DPAT  (1.25  and  2.5  mg/kg)
was  administered  [8].  Although  we  used  rather  high  doses  [17–19] ,
this  response  did  not  occur  after  the  administration  of  the  three
5-HT-enhancing  drugs.
Moreover,  our  results  revealed  that  5-HTP  and  FLX  unequally
evoked  additional  signs  to  the  ﬁve  common  responses.  Most
responses  were  observed  after  treatment  with  the  higher  doses
(160  and  320  mg/kg)  of  5-HTP  (8  out  of  14),  whereas  TCP  (4  mg/kg)
and  FLX  (20  mg/kg)  induced  5  and  7  responses  out  of  14,  respec-
tively.  The  fact  that  5-HTP  magniﬁes  5-HT  synthesis  could  account
for  the  efﬁcacy  of  this  drug.  Brain  microdialysis  experiments  in  rats
demonstrated  that  extracellular  5-HT  increased  to  about  300%  fol-
lowing  already  a  relatively  low  dose  (75  mg/kg)  of  5-HTP  [29] .  A
further increase  of  5-HTP  doses  raised  the  5-HT  release,  measured
by  an  in  vivo  voltammetry  study,  in  a  proportional  manner  [30] .The  tremendous  elevation  of  central  5-HT  by  5-HTP  was  explained
by  conversion  of  5-HTP  to  5-HT,  not  only  in  serotonergic  but  also
in  dopaminergic  neurons  [30] .  Hence,  the  broader  spectrum  of
responses  induced  by  5-HTP  in  comparison  to  TCP  and  FLX  might
be  related  to  a  stronger  stimulation  of  speciﬁc  5-HT  receptor  sub-
types.  Head  twitches,  for  example,  are  regarded  to  be  mediated  by
5-HT 2Areceptor  activation  [22,31–34] ,  forepaw  treading  is  induced
by  stimulation  of  5-HT 1Areceptors  [11] ,  and  5-HTP  induced  defe-
cation  is  a  well-known  effect  elicited  by  peripheral  action  of  5-HT,
especially  at  5-HT 4receptors  [35] .  Moreover,  the  hunched  back
has  been  shown  to  be  due  to  stimulation  of  5-HT 2Creceptors  [36] .
Besides  the  explanation  that  5-HTP  leads  to  a  higher  5-HT  release
than  FLX  and  TCP,  it  has  to  be  taken  into  account,  that  both  drugs
possess  secondary  pharmacological  properties  including  actions  at
other  transmission  systems.  TCP  is  an  unselective  inhibitor  of  MAO
A  and  B,  thus  inhibiting  also  the  degradation  of  dopamine  and  nor-
adrenaline.  FLX  is  known  to  increase  noradrenaline  and  dopamine
extracellular  levels in brain  [37] .  These  secondary  pharmacological
properties  might  have  interfered  with  some  of  the  SS  responses.
In our study  backward  walking,  head  waving,  head  shakes,  and
salivation  could  not  be  evoked  by  all  three  5-HT-enhancing  drugs.
In accordance to  our  results,  backward  walking,  head  shaking  and
salivation  also  failed  to  appear  in  other  mice  studies  after  treat-
ment with 5-HTP  [10,27] .  Surprisingly,  we  did  not  observe  the
Straub  tail  response  in  all  treatment  groups,  although  this  response
is  reported  in  corresponding  studies  [7,10,27] .  As  we  have  stated
above,  we  assume  that  strain  differences  and  procedural  variables
may  account  for  the  variations  in  study  results.
In  summary,  ﬂat  body  posture,  hindlimb  abduction  and  tremor
together  with  piloerection  and  decreased  rearings  turned  out  to  be
the  common  SS  responses  following  5-HT-enhancing  drugs  in  NMRI
mice.  When  establishing  the  model  of  SS  in  the  lab,  5-HTP  may
serve  as  the  most  appropriate  positive  control.  However,  it  has  to  be
considered  that  other  5-HT-enhancing  drugs  that  are  used  in  phar-
macological  research  may  induce  a  diverse  spectrum  of  behavioral
SS  responses  as  shown  by  FLX  and  TCP.
The  second  aim  of  our  study  was  to  investigate,  whether  the
interaction  of  5-HT-enhancing  drugs  can  be  described  as  an  over-
additive  effect.  In  laboratory  rodents,  a  potentiation  effect  by
combination of  5-HT-enhancing  drugs  has  been  assumed  and  it
has  been  termed  as  the  “5-HTP  potentiated  behavioral  syndrome”
[15,38]  and  the  behavioral  syndrome  “after  tryptophan  loading”
[16] .  Drug  potentiation  (or  over-additive  synergism)  can  be  phar-
macologically  deﬁned  as  the  joint  effect  of  two  drugs  that  is  greater
than  the  algebraic  sum  of  their  individual  effects  [39,40] .  In  order  to
characterize  the  interaction  pharmacologically,  we  identiﬁed  ﬁrst
the  minimal  effective  doses  of  5-HTP  (80  mg/kg),  FLX  (10  mg/kg),
and  TCP  (2  mg/kg),  i.e.  the  dose  which  evoked  at  least  one  of  the
SS  responses  in  our  experiments.  Our  results  revealed  that  all  com-
binations  of  the  three  5-HT-enhancing  drugs  led  to  an  increased
number  of  SS  responses  compared  to  single  drug  administration.
We  additionally  observed  that  the  sum  scores  for  each  response
obtained  by  the  drug  combinations  exceed  markedly  the  addition
of  the  sums  scores  of  the  single  drug  effects.  The  only  exception
is  piloerection  that  reached  almost  the  maximum  sum  already  fol-
lowing  low  drug  doses,  indicating  a  ceiling  effect.  Taken  together,
our  ﬁndings  of  the  drug  combination  experiments  argue  for  an
over-additive  synergistic  effect.  This  is  supported  by  brain  micro-
dialysis  studies  in  rats,  which  have  shown  that  the  elevation  of  5-HT
levels  by  concomitantly  given  drugs  is  enlarged  when  compared
to  the  administration  of  each  single  drug.  FLX  caused  a  2–4-fold
increase  in  extracellular  5-HT  concentration  in  the  neostriatum  and
hypothalamus.  When  5-HTP,  in  a  dose  which  alone  had  only  a  small
effect  was  added  to  FLX,  the  5-HT  release  was  10–16-fold  increased
[41,42] .  Also  clinical  studies  suggest  a  potentiation  effect,  since  the
SS  in  man  is  most  frequently  reported  after  the  ingestion  of  MAOR.  Haberzettl  et  al.  /  Behavioural  Brain  Research  277  (2015)  204–210  209
inhibitors  together  with  SRI  or  5-HT  releaser  even  in  therapeutic
doses  [26,43] .  Hence,  the  SS  in  NMRI  mice  induced  by  the  drug
combinations  seems  to  mirror  the  increased  risk  by  concomitant
ingestion  of  two  serotonin  agonists.
In  order  to  characterize  the  speciﬁcity  of  the  SS  model  and
to  examine  a  further  aspect  of  predictive  validity,  the  ﬁve  com-
mon  responses  induced  by  the  serotonergic  drugs  used  in  this
study  were  compared  to  the  effects  of  rather  high  doses  of  ago-
nists  at  the  dopamine  receptor  (APO),  the  acetylcholine  receptor
(OXO),  and  the  noradrenaline  receptor  (ATO).  Of  the  ﬁve  common
responses  induced  by  the  three  5-HT-enhancing  drugs,  hindlimb
abduction,  piloerection,  tremor,  and  decrease  in  rearing  were  vari-
ably  demonstrated  after  the  administration  of  APO,  OXO,  and  ATO.
We  observed  marked  differences  between  the  types  of  tremor:  5-
HT-induced  tremor  was  mild,  whereas  the  OXO-induced  tremor
was  severe  and  vigorous.  Tremor  induced  by  ATO  was  similar  to  5-
HT-induced  tremor  but  was  displayed  only  temporary  in  few  mice.
The  only response which  was  solely  induced  by  the  three  5-HT-
enhancing  drugs,  but  not  by  APO,  OXO,  and  ATO,  was  ﬂat  body
posture. This observation  is  in  line  with  the  general  assumption
that  ﬂat  body  posture  is  a  5-HT 1Areceptor  mediated  drug  effect,
especially by postsynaptic  5-HT 1Areceptors  [see  44] .  Interestingly,
in  some  animals  treated  with  OXO  and  APO  the  Straub  tail  response
was induced. The  Straub  tail  has  also  been  reported  by  others  in  APO
or  nicotine  treated  mice  [45,46] .  Taken  together,  the  comparison  of
the  effects  of  the  four  different  neurotransmitter  agonists  suggests
that  similar  responses  can  also  be  evoked  by  drugs  primarily  affect-
ing  other  transmission  systems.  Therefore,  when  a  drug  screening
test  is  performed,  we  suggest  to  perform  corresponding  receptor
antagonist  studies.
Summarizing,  we  identiﬁed  a  spectrum  of  SS  responses  in
NMRI  mice  that  reliably  and  robustly  manifested  following  the
administration  of  5-HTP,  FLX,  and  TCP:  ﬂat  body  posture,  hindlimb
abduction,  piloerection,  tremor,  and  decrease  in  rearing.  Subse-
quently,  we  demonstrated  that  the  combinations  of  5-HTP,  FLX,
and  TCP  have  a  drug  potentiation  effect.  Our  results  strengthen  the
predictive  validity  of  the  murine  SS,  arguing  for  its  application  as  a
translational  tool  in  safety  drug  screening  and  basic  research.  How-
ever,  it  has  to  be  considered  that  the  observed  responses  can  partly
be induced  by  activation  of  other  transmission  systems.  The  ﬁve
identiﬁed  common  responses  belong  to  the  frequently  reported
signs  and  should  be  at  least  examined  when  studying  the  SS  in
NMRI  mice.  However,  we  recommend  to  broaden  the  spectrum  of
responses,  when  other  mouse  strains  are  investigated.
