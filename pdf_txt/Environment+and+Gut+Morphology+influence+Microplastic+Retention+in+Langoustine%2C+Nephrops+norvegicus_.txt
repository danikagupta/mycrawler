ABSTRACT  11 
Over the past twenty years m icroplastic  pollution has  been recorded in all major marine habitats , 12 
and is now considered to be of high environmental concern. Correspondingly, t he number of  13 
reports of microplastic ingestion by  marine species is increasing. Despite this , there are still 14 
relatively few studies which address the uptake and retention of microplastic in wild populations . 15 
Langoustine, Nephrops norvegicus , sampled f rom the Clyde Sea Area , have previously been seen to 16 
contain large aggregations of microplastic fibres.  The large proportion of contaminated 17 
individuals  and size of the microplastic  aggregation s observed  suggests that Nephrops  are at high 18 
risk of microplastic inges tion.  In this study the level s of ingested microplastic in  populations  of N. 19 
norvegicus  from the Clyde Sea Area, North Minch and North Sea  are examined . Animals in the 20 
near -shore , Clyde Sea popu lation showed both a higher percentage of microplastic containing 21 
individual s and much great er weights of microplastic retained in the gut.  N. norvegicus  revealed  22 
that  only a small percentage of individuals from the North Sea and Minch contained microplastic, 23 
predominantly single strands.  An expanded sample from the Clyde Sea Area was examin ed to 24 
identify  the factors influencing microplastic retention. This revealed that males, larger individuals , 25 
and animals that had recently moulted contained lo wer levels of microplastic. The presence of 26 
identified food items  in the gut w as not seen to correlate with  microplastic loads.  Observations of 27 
microplastic in the shed stomach lining of recently moulted individuals and the lack of 28 
aggregations in wild -caught individuals suggests that ecdysis is  the primary  route of microplastic 29 
loss by N. norvegicus . Therefor e the larg e aggregations observed in wild -caught animals are 30 
believed to build up over extended periods as a result of the complex gut structure of N. 31 
norvegicus .  32

 1. Introduction  39 
The current scientific focus on the distribution and fate of microplastic pollution has led to 40 
numerous studies of its effects on marine communities. Due to the resistance  of polymers  to 41 
degradation and their relative buoyancy, p lastic s are able to persist  for long periods in the marine 42 
environment , and be carried far from their source  (Barnes et al., 2009 ). As a result, microplastics 43 
have been reported in environments far from anthropogenic activities.  (Barnes et al., 2009 ; Van 44 
Cauwenberghe et al.,  2013 ).  45 
Many of these observations of marine microplastic have shown a high degree of heterogeneity  in 46 
microplastic distribution (Ryan et al., 2009 ). The greatest densities of microplastic debris have 47 
been reported from the centres of gyres (Moore et al., 2001 ), lagoons (Vianello e t al., 2013 ), and in 48 
coastal sediments (Claessens et al., 2011 ). These apparent  at risk areas are the result of  a number 49 
of environmental factors , such as wind direction, currents, and bathymetry (Dixon and Dixon, 50 
1983 ; Moreira et al. , 2016 ; Shaw and M apes, 1979 ). Proximity to sources of microplastic pollution 51 
have also been seen to have a significant impact on local abundance (Reddy et al., 2006 ).  52 
Despite the recent increase in available literature, much of the evidence on plastic uptake by 53 
animals relates  to the ingestion of macroplastic by  large marine vertebrates , such as birds (van 54 
Franeker et al., 2004 ) and turtles (Lutz, 1 990 ). Sampling of fish collected in trawls has also shown  55 
that a range of fishes also take up both macro - and microplastics from the environment (Boerger 56 
et al., 2010 ; Lusher et al., 2013 ). Unfortunately due to the large ranges over which these species 57 
forage, and the uncertainty over the length of time plastic is retained in the gut, it is difficult to 58 
draw a conclusion as to  the relationship between environmental and ingested plastics.  59 
Many of the observations of plastic ingestion by  invertebrates stem from laboratory 60 
investigations . In this way , uptake  of micro plastic s has been observed in blue mussel, Mytillus 61 
edulis  (Browne et al., 2008 ; Farrell and Nelson, 2013 ; von Moos et al., 2012 ), shore crab, Carcinus 62 
maenas  (Farrell and Nelson, 2013 ), sandhoppers, Talitrus saltator  (Ugolini et al., 2013 ), lugworm, 63 
Arenicola marina  (Browne et al., 2013 ), and echinoderms (Graham and Thompson, 2009 ). Shore 64 
crabs have also been seen to take in plastic microspheres through the gills  during normal 65 
respiration  (Watts et al., 2014 ), and trophic links have been indicated by the transfer of 66 
microbeads from mussels (Farrell and Nelson, 2013 ).   67 
Fewer studies examine the uptake of microplasti c by wild -caught in vertebrates; however, the 68 
level of uptake observed appears to support the findings of laboratory investigations. Large 69 
numbers of contaminated individ uals have been recorded amongst  crustaceans; for example 63% 70 
of brown shrimp, Crangon cragon , sampled from the English Channel and southern North Sea 71 
were seen to contain microplastics (Devriese et al., 2015 ), as were  82% of langoustine, Nephrops 72 
norvegicus , from the Clyde Sea Area (Murray and Cowie, 2011 ). Lower levels were observed  73 3 
 amongst gooseneck barnacles, Lepas  spp., with 33.5% of 385 individuals sampled from the North 74 
Pacific Sub -tropical Gyre seen to contain microplastic  (Goldstein and Goodwin, 2013 ). 75 
N. norvegicus  is a species  of great  importance to the UK fishing indu stry. In 2014 it accounted for a 76 
fifth of the weight of shellfish landings by the UK fleet and a third of the value, at 30 thousand 77 
tonnes and £99 million. This substantial sum made it the second most important fishery in the UK 78 
in 2014 . Murray and Cowie’s  examination of  120 N. norvegicus  from the Clyde Sea indicated that 79 
large aggregations of microplastic are found in a significant  proportion of the population.  Unlike 80 
the vertebrates previously seen to take up plastics in the wild, N. norvegicus  feed within a small 81 
area around their burrows;  thus the level of contamination in wild caught animals is potentially 82 
indicative of the amount of microplastic in the surrounding environment.   83 
The Clyde Sea Area  is an enclosed waterbody in close proximity to numerous potential 84 
microplastic sources, a  combi nation of factors which suggests a high  abundance  of environmental 85 
microplastics . However, geographically separated populations of N. norvegicus  are exposed to 86 
very different bathymetric conditions  and anthropogenic influences . The variation in distance 87 
from sources of litter suggests  that the average in take  of microplastic by N. norvegicus  populations 88 
in other locations may be much lower .  89 
This study examine s the occurrence  of microplastic in N. norvegicus  in Scottish waters. The work  90 
aims to determine whether the high levels of microplastic observed by Murray and Cowie (2011) 91 
are representative of those in other populations. Analysis of the environmental and biological 92 
factors related to  microplastic levels  in the three studied populations is used to identify the 93 
factors responsible for the aggregation  of ingested microplastic.  94

2. Materials and Methods  96 
2.1. Microplastic in Scottish Nephrops norvegicus  97 
N. norvegicus  were collected from three sites in North and West Scotland; the Clyde Sea Area  98 
(CSA) , the North Minch  (NM) , and the No rth Sea  (NS)  (Fig . 1). In the CSA  four trawls were taken at 99 
Skelmorlie Bank and in the Main Channel at depths between 58 and 110  metres in May, June and 100 
August (Fig . 2). Sampl ing was carried out using otter trawls rigged with 50mm mesh. To reduce 101 
the potential for uptake of fibres from the sampling net was reduced by only carrying out short 102 
trawls.  Individuals were frozen immediately on landing to prevent digestion of the gut content.  103 4

 Animals were defrosted prior to dissection , and their sex, moult stage, and carapace length 114 
recorded.  Moult stage was determined by testing the hardness of the thorax, directly behi nd the 115 
eyes . Intermoult individuals could be identified by their hard carapaces, while recently moulted 116 
individuals have a jelly -like carapace, and those of animals immediately prior to and post moult is 117 
papery  (Farmer, 1973 ). The carapace of the individual was then removed and the muscle of the 118 
thorax and tail separated to allow the removal of the st omach and gastric tract, which was 119 
preserv ed in 80% ethanol (Murray and Cowie, 2011 ).  120 
The content of each gut was examined under a stereo microscope to determine the  volume and 121 
identity of natural prey and presence of potential microplastics.  Gut contents were examined in 122 
subsets of approximately 0.5 ml (a level spatula) to ensure that the d etectability of plastic in the 123 
gut contents was not impacted by the volume of food.  Plastic materials were categorised as either 124 
pre-production pellets, fragments, films or fibres. Aggregations of f ibres were grouped into the 125 
following subcategories; up to  five strands, strands and a loose ball of fi bres, and a tight ball of  126 
multiple  fibres (Murray and Cowie, 2011). A Mettler MX5 balance (Mettler -Toledo international 127 
Inc., Columbus, USA) was then used to record the weight of plastic recovered from each individual 128 
to five decimal places. Prior to weighing, any algae tangled among the plastic fi bres were removed 129 
and the samples air dried for 48 hours. Each sample was weighed three times and a mean taken.  130 
 131 
2.2 Identification of Microplastic  132 
FT-IR spectrome try was used to identify a sub -set of 100 suspected plastic items. Tangled fibres 133 
were separated for individual analysis and all samples were rinsed in distilled water and allowed 134 
to air dry to ensure the clean est possible  spectrum. Samples were analysed u sing a Shimadzu 135 
8400s spectrometer and t he resulting spectra were compared to those of a range of known 136 
polymer standards to confirm their identity. The percentage of successfully  identified plastics  was 137 
used to calculate the actual number of microplastic items recovered.  138 
 139 
2.3. Duration of Microplastic Retention  140 
Previous examination  of 120 individuals from the CSA indicated lower plastic contamination in 141 
recently moulted individuals (Murray and Cowie, 2011 ). To establish whether microplastics are 142 
lost during ecdysis a two month feeding trial  was carried out. Ten recently moulted female N. 143 
norvegicus  were placed into individual tanks and fed with a daily ration of 0.5 g of squid mantle, 144 
seeded with five 0.5mm strands of polypropylene (PP) rope. After the first month,  bilateral eye 145 
ablation was used to induce moult  (Fingerman, 1987 ). Feeding with microplastic seeded squid 146 6 
 was  continued until the individual had achieved e cdysis. The shed gut lining was  recovered and 147 
the moulted individual frozen for gut content analysis  as described above.  148 
 149 
2.4. Statistical Analysis  150 
Analysis of the factors affecting  microplastic accumulation by N. norvegicus  was carried out using 151 
Minitab 15. The relative frequencies of microplastic containing animals in the three populations 152 
were  examin ed using Chi-squared analysis.  153 
The data from the CSA sample was used to determine both  the factors affecting microplastic 154 
ingestion , and th ose affecting  the weight  of retained microplasti c. The statistical software R, 155 
version 3.0.2, was used to relate  the microplastic data to carapace length, sex, moult stage, trawl 156 
number, sampling site, and the presence and type of food. Factors associated with the likelihood  157 
of plastic occurrence in N. norvegicus  were determined by fitting a binary logistic model (BLM) . 158 
The factors responsible for the weight of retained plastic were examined using a general ised 159 
linear model (GLM).  160 
 161 
3. Results  162 
Trawl samples returned  1450 animals for dissection and analysis . Those from the N orth Minch 163 
(150  animals ) and N orth Sea  (300  animals ) were all male, whilst the larger sample of individuals  164 
from the CSA  (1000 animals)  was separated into 50% males and females. Of th e total  1450 165 
individuals , 975  (67%)  were seen t o contain micro plastic, predominantly microfibre s.  166 
The fibres recovered were a range of colours and thicknesses, the exact proportions of which 167 
could not be determined due to the highly tangled aggregations. Of the samples yielding 168 
sufficie ntly clear spectra for analysis 94% were confirmed as plastics.  Nylon and polypropylene 169 
were the most frequently observed polymers , and  made up 37.2%, 29.8% and 12.8% of the 170 
analysed plastic, respectively. Smaller amounts of polyethylene - mainly from ingested films - and 171 
PVC were also recovered.  172 7

3.1. Local Variation in Microplastic Uptake  177 
Variation was seen in the proportion of individuals at each sit e which contained microplastics 178 
(Table 1) . Chi-squared analysis of the number of contaminated individuals at each site indicated a 179 
significant difference between the three locations (P < 0.001, X2 = 572.756, df =10). This disparity 180 
is driven by individuals sampled from the Clyde.  181

 The most commonly isolated plastics were fragmented f ibre s. Other plastics found were mainly 186 
films, although one pre -produ ction nib was isolated. In the offshore populations, contaminated 187 
individuals contained a maximum of 5 fibres, whilst 41% of the CSA were seen to have aggregated 188 
tangled “Balls” of multiple fibres and algae  (Fig. 3).  189 
 190 
3.2. Factors Affecting Microplastic in the Gut of N. norvegicus  from the Clyde Sea  191 
Trawl depths in the CSA ranged from 74 – 115m in the Main Channel and 60 – 75m in the Fairlie 192 
Channel; sediment analysis at the two sites revealed average grain sizes of 0.18mm a nd  0.166mm 193 
respectively. The carapace length of individuals in the CSA sample ranged from 19.8 to 59.1mm , 194 
and was found to be normally distributed when examined using Kolmogrov -Smirnov analysis (P < 195 
0.010). The proportion of individuals at each moult phas e differed between males and females, 196 
possibly the result of reduced moult frequency in mature females (Farmer, 1973). The 197 
examination of identifiable prey items indicated a diet dominated by bivalve molluscs  and 198 
crustaceans, with N. norvegicus  carapace  regularly observed . These two categories made up 199 
74.1% of the identifiable gut contents , with the rest being comprised of fish bones, echinoderms 200 
and polychaetes.  Variation in the aggregation and weight of plastic was observed in individuals 201 
recovered from the four trawls, with lower weights of plastic seen later in the year (Table 2).   202

The results of the BLM identified moult stage, date of trawl, and carapace length as having a 207 
significant impact on the likelihood of plastic contamination in N. norvegicus . Recently moulted 208 
(“jelly” carapace) individuals were seen to be less likely to contain plastics than those at 209 
intermoult (“hard” carapace) (z= -6.112, P<0.001). Carapace length was also seen to effect the 210 
likelihood of plastic presence, with smaller individuals more likely to contain microplastics (z= - 211 
1.829, P<0 .05); however, the observed relationship was of lower significance than that of moult 212 
stage and trawl date.  213

  214 
While there was a significant difference in the occurrence and aggregation of plastic recovered 215 
from N. norvegicus  from different geographical are as, there was no difference observed between 216 
the trawl locations within the CSA. The only non -biotic factor observed to have a significant 217 
impact on whether pla stic was present within the gut  was the season  in which the animals were 218 
collected; with lower l ikelihood of plastic contamination in tows carried out in June; trawl three 219 
(z= -3.675, P<0.001), and August; trawl 4 (z=  4.3, P<0.001). This variation is believed to be due to 220 
a reduction in the number of recently moulted individuals later in the year.  221 
The results of the GLM analysis of  the factors associated with variation in the weight of 222 
microplastic returned a similar response to that of the BLM of plastic occurrence. The results 223 
indicated that the moult stage of the individual was significantly relat ed to the weight of plastic 224 
present (P<0.001), this was driven by lower weights of plastic in recently moulted individuals  225 
(Fig.  4). Females were seen to retain greater weights of plastic than males (t= 4.245, P<0.001)  226 
(Fig .5). A significant negative relat ionship was also observed between the proportion of gut 227 
occupied by food and the weight of recovered plastic (P<0.001); individuals recorded as having no 228 
food in the foregut were observed to have the highest microplastic load. Sampling trawl had the 229 
highes t influence over the amount of plastic retained (P<0.001), this was driven by a low average 230 
plastic weight recovered in  animals from  trawls three and four.  231

3.3. Plastic Lost at Moult  238 
Seven of the 10 animals subjected to eye ablation moulted within the two month experimental 239 
period. During the feeding period the animals did not consume the whole food ration each day, 240 
and so the total number of fibres ingested could not be definitively stated; however, w hen the gut 241 
linings were examined under stereo microscope, five were seen to contain microplastics. Stomach 242 
content analysis carr ied out on all post moult individuals revealed no remaining plastics in the 243 
foregut, whereas plastic aggregations were observed in the three un -moulted individuals.  244 
 245 
4. Discussion  246 
Despite the number of studies into the distribution of microplastics, there are few that look at 247 
their ingestion  in benthic habitats  (Reddy et al., 2006 ; Van Cauwenberghe et al., 2013 ). Our results 248 
demonstrate m icroplastic uptake  by N. norvegicus  from each of the sampled locations . The most 249 
commonly observed plastics in all three populations were fibres, indicating  either  that these  are 250 
the most abundant plastics at all sites or that fibres are  more  easily ingested.  In previous studies 251 
of microplastic in the marine environment , fibres have been the dominant plastic category .  252 
These fibres varied in colour, thickness and degree of we ar, and are believed to originate from a 253 
range of sources. FT-IR analysis of single micro -fibres proved highly laborious, occasionally 254 
11 
 resulting in unclear, ‘noisy’ results – an issue also stated by Gallagher et al . (2015 ), however this 255 
did reveal 96% success rate in visual identification of p lastics. This revealed a mix of polymers. 256 
Many of the observed fibres may have entered the CSA from the River Clyde and are potentially 257 
the released from clothes washing as outlined in Browne et al. (2011 ). Trawl nets may r elease 258 
plastics into the CSA both from regular use and the breakdown of lost gear; however, the number 259 
of blue and orange fibres observed was comparatively low.  260 
 261 
4.1. Local Variation in Microplastic Uptake  262 
The frequency  of microplastic occurrence  and level of aggregation observed in the CSA support 263 
that  previously record ed by Murray and Cowie (201 1) from a smaller sample size ; however, i t is 264 
apparent from the results that N. norvegicus  from the North Minch and North Sea have 265 
substantially lower microplastic loads . The disparity in microplastic uptake  is believed to be 266 
caused by the  CSA’s  relative proximity  to microplastic sources , resulting in locally raised 267 
concentrations of environmental microplastics. As such, a reas close to high levels of human  268 
activity  - such as estuaries and enclosed water bodies  - may be thought of as high risk,  and 269 
animals living there  as having a greater  likelihood  of microplastic uptak e. Within the Clyde sea 270 
there were significant differences in microplastic load between sample trawls; however, previous 271 
examination of the average abundance of microplastic in the sediments of the North Channel and 272 
Fairlie Channel – 45.5 and 42.2 plastic items per kilogram respectively – showed no significant 273 
variation  (Welden, unpublished data). It is believed that the variation observed can be attributed 274 
to biotic differences.  275 
The current route by which microplastics enter the food chain is un clear;  however, many species 276 
of invertebrates (Devriese et al., 2015 ; Ugolini et al., 2013 ; Van Cauwenberghe and Janssen, 2014 ) 277 
and fishes (Boerger et al., 2010 ; Lusher e t al., 2013 ; Lusher et al., 2015 ) have show n some degree 278 
of contamination . In the marine environment, in teractions between animals and microplastic  may 279 
occur in a number of ways;  when examining plastic contaminated fish Lu sher et al (2013 ) suggest 280 
that plastic is taken up accidentally during feeding , whereas Boerger et al (2010 ) indicate that 281 
microplastics may be actively consumed due to their resemblance to planktonic prey . Planktonic 282 
crustaceans have also been seen to actively ingest plastics, although some species appeared able 283 
to discriminate against larger polystyrene  beads (Bern, 1990 ). 284 
N. norvegicus  act as both scavengers  and carnivores , and may take up plastic during feeding or 285 
burrowing  activities . Other crustaceans, such as crabs , have comparable feeding methods, and 286 
may  be at  a similar risk of microplastic loading.  The shore crab C. maenas  has been seen to take in 287 
microplastic spheres from contaminated mussel, M. edulis (Farrell and Nelson, 2013 ; Watts et al., 288 12 
 2014 ), and through the gills during respiration (Watts et al., 2014 ), as well as fibres from 289 
prepared mussel/gelatine blocks (Watts et al., 2015 ).  290 
In a study of the impact of feeding mode, filterers such as bivalves were found to ingest the 291 
highest levels of microspheres (Setälä et al., 2015 ); if this is also true of fibres , molluscs  in the CSA  292 
would  experience a higher frequency of  micropl astic ingestion than that observed here.  However, 293 
this relies on microplastic being obtained direct ly from the environment and does not take into 294 
account potential b ioaccumulation. N. norvegicus are opportunistic scavengers, consuming a 295 
range of prey species. Bioaccumulation would rely on animals consuming multiple small prey 296 
animals whole, consuming their plastic load in the process. The observations of gut contents 297 
reported here revealed a high percentage of larger animals , such as mollusc and crustaceans , 298 
which were partially consumed.  The potential for bioaccumulation is currently obscured by 299 
numerous sources of uncertainty; f urther research into the trophic transf er of mic roplastic and its 300 
retention by a range of  species is required before the true risk can be established.  301 
 302 
4.2. Biological Factors Influencing Microplastic Retention  303 
The volume of microplastic recovered from N. norvegicus  in the CSA reveals that aggregations are 304 
held in the foregut for extended periods of time . The statistical analysis of the factors responsible 305 
for high microplastic weights  indicated  that sex, size, and moult stage have the greatest influence 306 
on aggregation .  307 
The negative re lationship between body size and microplastic  loads  may be the result of the gut 308 
morphology of N. norvegicus . The digestive tract of crustaceans is relatively complex that 309 
compared to other invertebrates. The gastric mill is a set of chitinous plates found  in the foregut , 310 
at the entrance to the hindgut  (Farmer, 1975 ). The shape of these plates and the narrowing at the 311 
entrance to the hindgut may prevent microplastic from being egested with natural food -stuff . 312 
Previous work examining  the morphology of the gastric mill in relation to carapace length ha s 313 
shown that the g aps in the mill increase with growth  (Welden et al., 2015 ). The increased size of 314 
the gaps between plates  of the mill may allow a great er amount of microplastic to be lost by 315 
egestion in  larger individuals.  316 
This link between size and microplastic loss may also explain the relationship seen between sex 317 
and microplastic aggregation. Female N. norvegicus  grow at a slower rate than males  due to a 318 
decreased moult frequency. As a result they  have smaller gastric mills which would prevent the 319 
egestion of microplastics  that could be passed by larger, male conspecifics .  320 
The presence of fibres  in the discarded gut lining of moulted N. norvegicus  indicates that 321 
microplastic can be lost at ecdysis. This supports the outputs of both the BLM of microplastic 322 13 
 occurrence and the GLM of fac tors influencing the weight of microplastic retai ned in the gut. 323 
Consequently , the authors believe  moult ing to be t he lead cause of microplastic loss in 324 
langoustine.  325 
Of the biological factors linked to the retention of microplastic it is likely that the si ze of the 326 
gastric mill has the greatest influence on the retention of microplastics; particularly in larger size 327 
classes. The significantly lower weight of microplastic in recently moulted individuals from the 328 
Clyde indicate that N. norvegicus  rid themselves of large plastic aggregations at moult, this was 329 
supported by the observed plastic in the shed guts of animals subjected to eye ablation. These two 330 
factors are believed to have the greatest effect on the weight of retained microplastic. The  331 
discrepancy in microplastic observed between male and female langoustine is believed to be the 332 
result of increased moult frequency in male langoustine and, as male langoustine are generally 333 
larger, increased size in the gastric mill.    334 
 335 
4.3. Potential Impacts of Microplastic Retention  336 
The large aggregations of microplastic fibres observed in the CSA population  indicate that N. 337 
norvegicus  in this area are at increased risk of the biological impacts of plastic ingestion . Previous 338 
studies have shown a number of effects  of ingested plastic  on an animal’s fitness. These include  339 
false satiation, previously described in seabirds (Ryan, 1988 ) and turtles (Lutz, 1990 ; McCauley 340 
and Bjorndal, 1999 ), and nutrient dilution - preventing the assimilation of ingested foods 341 
(McCauley and Bjorndal, 1999 ).  342 
Although different in their mechanics, both of th ese conditions cause a reduced nutritional state 343 
and have been seen to result in starvation. For example, i n the lugworm , Arenicola marina , plastic 344 
ingestion neg atively affect ed feeding rate , leading to  reduced body mass (Besseling et al., 2012 ). In 345 
addition to their impact on the body condition, p lastics also carry hydrophobic contaminants 346 
(Teuten et al., 2007 ; Teuten et al., 2009 ). Regular ingestion and retention  may result in pollutants 347 
transferring from plastic to the organism  (Besseling et al., 2012 ).   348 
The results presented above describe a negative relationship between microplastic weight and 349 
stomach fullness . This  may indicate reduced feeding as a result of false satiation. Using the relative 350 
proportions of the identified  polymers we  calculated a mean specific gravity for the plastics in N. 351 
norvegicus  in the CSA. From this it was possible to calculate an approximat e mean volume of 352 
0.68mm3 of aggregated plastic per contaminated individual. The calculated volume of the largest 353 
recorded aggregation was 9.40mm3. This volume may appear low on first examination; however 354 
the size of the observed aggregations were increased  by trapped natural materials. An individual 355 
of 20mm carapace length if expected to have a gut volume of 0.806c m3 (Welden et al., 2015 ), and 356 14 
 the combined plastic and algae aggregations observed took up to ten percent of the foregut. 357 
Whilst N. norvegicus  are highly tolerant to starv ation (Mente, 2010 ), long periods of retention  may 358 
cause reduced (or even negative) growth.  359 
Due to their smaller size and reduced moult rate at maturity, female N. norvegicus  would retain 360 
plastic for up to twice as long as males, making them more likely to contain high plastic loads. 361 
Reduced body mass, is known to lower  fecundity in a number of crustacean species (Beyers and 362 
Goosen, 1987 ; Hines, 1991 ; Lizárraga -Cubedo et al., 2003 ), including N. norve gicus  (Abellô and 363 
Sardá, 1982 ). In European Lobster, Homarus gammarus , smaller individuals have also been shown 364 
to have smaller eggs (Tully et al., 2001 ). In this way, sub-lethal microplastic loads  may have 365 
impacts at the population  level.  366 
N. norv egicus  is a species of high  economic importance in Europe. T he impacts of microplastic 367 
ingestion on fitness and fecundity may impact the viability of  nearshore fisherie s. As a result  of 368 
this uncertainty , the authors consider further examination of the impact of microplastic on the 369 
fitness of N. norvegicus  to be of high importance . 370 
 371 
5. Conclusion  372 
It is clear from the results presented that N. norvegicus  from nearshore habitats exhibit 373 
significantly higher microplastic abundance  in them  than those  located in areas  further from 374 
anthropogenic inputs . In addition to the much lower percentage of individuals seen to contain 375 
plastic, t he large aggregations record ed in Clyde Sea animals were not observed in those from the 376 
North Sea and North Minch.  377 
As well as the effect of location on plastic uptake, the individuals in  the C SA sample indicate that  378 
size, sex and moult stage significantly influence microplastic loads. The ability of N. norvegicus  to 379 
routinely expel microplastic aggregations along with the gut lining  at moult reduces the negative 380 
effect  of thei r complex  gut morp hology to some extent; however, the possibility of a 12 month 381 
microplastic exposure period suggests a high probability of associated negative impacts.   382
