Proposed Report on Carcinogens Delisting for Saccharin1 
Saccharin is currently listed in the Report on Carcinogens, 8th Edition as reasonably 
anticipated to be a human carcinogen. The basis for this listing was sufficient evidence of 
carcinogeniC-ity in experimental animals. The Calorie Control Council has petitioned the NTP to 
consider delisting saccharin from its Report on Carcinogens based upon mechanistic data related 
to development ofurinary bladder cancers in rats. 
Carcinogenicity 
In four studies ofup to 30 months duration, sodium saccharin was carcinogenic in Charles 
River CD and Sprague-Dawley male rats as evidenced by a dose-related increased incidence of 
benign or malignant urinary bladder neoplasms at dietary concentrations of 1% or greater (Tisdel 
et al., 1974; Arnold et al., 1980; Taylor et al., 1980; Schoenig et al., 1985). Non-statistically 
significant increases in urinary bladder cancer have also been seen in saccharin-treated female rats 
from studies showing a positive effect in males (Arnold et al., 1980; Taylor et al., 1980). 
Furthermore, several initiation/promotion studies in different rat strains have shown a reduced 
latency and/or increased incidence of similar urinary bladder cancers in male and female rats fed 
sodium saccharin subsequent to treatment with different urinary bladder initiators (e.g., Hicks 
and Chowaniec, 1977; Cohen et al., 1979; Nakanishi et al., 1980b; West et al., 1986; Fukushima 
et al., 1990). Several additional rat studies in which sodium saccharin was administered either in 
the diet or in drinking water were negative for tumorigenicity (Fitzhugh et al., 1951; Lessel, 1971; 
Schmahl, 1973; cited by IARC, 1980; Chowaniec and Hicks, 1979; Hooson et al., 1980; Schmahl 
and Habs, 1984). 
Three mouse studies have reported positive carcinogenicity following exposure to 
saccharin. Two ofthese studies involved surgical implantation of saccharin-containing 
cholesterol pellets into the urinary bladders and resulted in development of malignant urothelial 
neoplasms (Allen et al., 1957; Bryan et al., 1970). In the third study, dietary sodium saccharin 
resulted in increased incidences ofmalignant thyroid neoplasms (Prasad and Rai, 1986). While 
the mouse data cannot be discounted, some ofthese studies had methodological flaws, provided 
limited information, did not show a dose-response, or had unexpected outcomes that may be 
species or strain-specific and should be verified by additional studies. Four studies in mice were 
judged negative for tumorigenesis (Roe et al., 1970; Kroes et al., 1977; Hornberger, 1978; 
Frederick et al., 1989) as were studies in nonhuman primates (McChesney et al., 1977 abstr.; 
Sieber and Adamson, 1978; both cited by IARC, 1980; Thorgiersson et al., 1994; Cohen et al., 
1996 abstr.) and a single hamster study (Althoff et al., 197 5). 
Much ofthe epidemiology has examined associations between urinary bladder cancer and 
artificial sweeteners, rather than saccharin per se. The time trend data for bladder cancer are 
essentially noninformative with no clear indication that the increased use of saccharin or artificial 
sweeteners commencing in the 1940s is associated with a general increase in bladder cancer when 
controlled for confounding factors, chiefly smoking. Risk ofbladder cancer in diabetics, who 
presumably consume greater amounts of artificial sweeteners compared to the general population, 
1Saccharin is produced commercially as calcium and sodium salts as well as the free acid, and the name saccharin 
has been applied to all three.

NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
is not greater than risks in the general population (Armstrong and Doll, 1975). Based upon 
several case-control studies there is no overall association between use ofartificial sweeteners and 
bladder cancer (reviewed by IARC, 1980; IARC, 1987b; JECF A, 1993). It is harder to reject an 
association between use ofartificial sweeteners and bladder cancer in some case-control 
subgroups, even though the numbers are small2 (Howe et al., 1980; Hoover and Strasser, 1980; 
Morrison and Buring, 1980; Cartwright et al., 1981; Morrison et al., 1982; Mommsen et al., 
1983). Taken together, while the available epidemiology data show no consistent evidence that 
saccharin is associated with increased bladder cancer in general, a small increased risk in some 
subgroups, such as heavy users ofartificial sweeteners, cannot be unequivocally excluded. With 
regard to the general population, if sodium saccharin is a risk factor, it is weak and cannot be 
proven or disproved due to lack of actual exposure data and intrinsic limitations ofexisting 
epidemiology studies. 
Other Information Relating to Carcinogenesis or Possible Mechanisms of 
Carcinogenesis 
Extensive studies ofthe mutagenicity and genotoxicity ofsaccharin have shown generally 
negative but occasionally conflicting results. Sodium saccharin is essentially nonmutagenic in 
conventional bacterial systems but is weakly clastogenic or genotoxic in short-term in vitro and in 
vivo test systems (reviewed by Ashby, 1985; IARC, 1987a,b; Whysner and Williams, 1996) 
with evidence that equimolar ionic solutions of sodium chloride in vitro produce a comparable 
cytotoxic response (Garland et al., 1989a). Urine from mice treated with sodium saccharin was 
mutagenic in the Ames test (Batzinger et al., 1977). Saccharin does not covalently bind to DNA 
and does not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in bladder urothelium. 
Saccharin-induced carcinogenesis in rats shows a sex predilection for males (Tisdel et al., 
1974; Arnold et al., 1980; Taylor et al., 1980), an organ specificity for urinary bladder (Tisdel et 
al., 1974; Arnold et al., 1980; Taylor et al., 1980; Fukushima et al., 1983; Schoenig et al., 1985), 
and a dose-response when exposure to dietary concentrations of 1 to 7.5% ofthe sodium salt of 
saccharin has begun early in life (beginning at birth or immediately at weaning) and is continued 
for approximately two years (Schoenig et al., 1985). The results ofmechanistic studies have 
shown that certain physiological conditions must be simultaneously or sequentially present for 
induction ofurinary bladder tumorigenesis. These conditions include a urinary pH greater than 
6.5, increased urinary sodium concentration, increased urine volume, decreased urine osmolality, 
presence ofurinary crystals or precipitate, and damage to the urothelium resulting in a 
proliferative (hyperplastic) response. All ofthese conditions have been studied extensively in 
male rats but less so in females. The high levels of urinary protein characteristic ofmany male 
rats may partially explain the sex predilection. The high intrinsic rate ofurothelial proliferation 
at about the time ofweaning is also believed to contribute to the observed tumorigenic effects. 
The urinary milieu in rats, especially male rats, is sufficiently different from that in humans or 
other species to support the contention that these observations are rat-specific. Pharmacokinetic 
2 Morrison and Suring (1980) indicate an increased risk for women. Hoover and Strasser (1980) suggest increased 
risk among low risk (non-smoking, non-occupationally exposed women) and high risk (male heavy smokers) 
subgroups. 
2 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
and metabolism data on sodium saccharin do not explain the male rat sensitivity for induction of 
urinary bladder neoplasms (Sweatman and Renwick, 1979, 1980). 
Conclusion 
There is evidence ofthe carcinogenicity ofsaccharin in rats but less convincing evidence in 
mice. Mechanistic studies indicate that the observed urinary bladder cancers in rat studies are 
related to urinary pH, osmolality, volume, presence ofprecipitate, and urothelial damage with 
attendant hyperplasia following dietary concentrations of3% or higher with inconsistent findings 
at lower dietary concentrations. The factors thought to contribute to tumor induction by sodium 
saccharin in rats would not be expected to occur in humans. The mouse data are inconsistent and 
require verification by additional studies. Results ofseveral epidemiology studies indicate no 
clear association between saccharin consumption and urinary bladder cancer. Although it is 
impossible to absolutely conclude that it poses no threat to human health, sodium saccharin is 
not reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen under conditions ofgeneral usage as an 
artificial sweetener.

Listing Criteria from the Report on Carcinogens, Eighth Edition 
Known To Be A Human Carcinogen: 
There is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans which indicates a 
causal relationship between exposure to the agent, substance or mixture and human cancer. 
Reasonably Anticipated To Be A Human Carcinogen: 
There is limited evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans, which indicates that 
causal interpretation is credible, but that alternative explanations, such as chance, bias or 
confounding factors, could not adequately be excluded; or 
There is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in experimental· animals which 
indicates there is an increased incidence of malignant and/or a combination of malignant and 
benign tumors: (1) in multiple species or at multiple tissue sites, or (2)by multiple routes 
of exposure, or (3) to an unusual degree with regard to incidence, site or type of tumor, or 
age at onset; or 
There is less than sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans or laboratory animals; 
however, the agent, substance or mixture belongs to a well-defined, structurally related 
class of substances whose members are listed in previous Reports on Carcinogens as either 
known to be a human carcinogen or reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen, or 
there is convincing relevant information that the agent acts through mechanisms indicating it 
would likely cause cancer in humans. 
Conclusions regarding carcinogenicity in humans or experimental animals are based on scientific 
judgment, with consideration given to all relevant information. Relevant information includes, but 
is not limited to dose response, route of exposure, chemical structure, metabolism, 
pharmacokinetics, sensitive sub populations, genetic effects, or other data relating to mechanism of 
action or factors that may be unique to a given substance. For example, there may be substances 
for which there is evidence of carcinogenicity in laboratory animals but there are compelling data 
indicating that the agent acts through mechanisms which do not operate in humans and would 
therefore not be reasonably anticipated to cause cancer in humans.

2.0 HUMAN EXPOSURE 
Summary: The original uses of saccharin were numerous. Today, it is primarily used as 
a nonnutritive sweetening agent. From the 1950's to the 1970's, the U.S. consumption of 
saccharin increased dramatically. Following the ban on saccharin in Canada, stricter legislation on 
the marketing ofsaccharin, and the introduction ofother artificial sweeteners into the U.S. 
market, consumption steadily declined. Recently, however, it appears that U.S. saccharin 
consumption is steady, ifnot slightly increasing. 
Saccharin and sodium saccharin have been produced commercially in the United States for 
over 80 years. The compounds are produced commercially only by the Maumee process. 
Calcium saccharin was first produced in the United States in 1953. U.S. imports and production 
of saccharin has steadily declined. Currently, PMC Specialties Group, Inc. is the only 
commercial producer ofsaccharin. 
Potential exposure to saccharin occurs through the consumption ofdietetic foods and 
drinks and by use of some personal hygiene products. The concentration of saccharin allowed in 
these products is regulated by the FDA. Potential exposure to saccharin also occurs in the 
workplace, specifically in occupations, industries, or facilities that produce and deal with 
saccharin and its salts. 
Regulation ofsaccharin and its salts is accomplished through many agencies and 
legislation. The EPA regulates saccharin and its salts under the Comprehensive Environmental 
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), Resource Conservation and Recovery 
Act (RCRA), and Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA). The FDA 
regulates saccharin under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&CA). Saccharin is regulated by 
OSHA under the Hazard Communication Standard. 
2.1 Production 
The 1979 Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Inventory identified three U.S. 
companies producing 1.1 million lb ( 499 metric tons [Mg]) of saccharin in 1977, while 6.3 million 
lb (2,860 Mg) were imported. Two U.S. companies produced 1.6 million lb (726 Mg) ofsodium 
saccharin, and 281,000 lb (128 Mg) were imported in 1977. Imports ofcalcium saccharin, which 
was first produced commercially in the United States in 1953, amounted to 5,500 lb (2.5 Mg) in 
1977. One U.S. company produced 550,000 lb (250 Mg) ofthe ammonium salt in 1977 (NTP, 
1994). 
Production ofall forms ofsaccharin increased gradually from 180 Mg in 1957 to an 
estimated 2,040 Mg in 1970 to an estimated total of2,177 Mg in 1977 (IARC, 1980). The 
USITC (1981-1991, 1993-1995) identified one U.S. producer ofsaccharin and its sodium salt 
from 1980 to 1994, but no production data were provided for these years. The USITC (1983­
1985) also reported that one U.S. company produced saccharin, calcium salt, from 1982 to 1984, 
but no production data were provided. SRI International (1996) identified one U.S. producer of 
sodium saccharin, most likely PMC Specialties Group, Inc. which produces saccharin under the 
trade name SYNCAL ® in the United States and worldwide (PMC Specialties Group, 1996).

PMC Specialties Group also produces and markets the SYNCAL ® saccharin products 
SWEET-CHE~ (for animal feed) and SHERBRITE® (for the plating industry) (PMC 
Specialties Group, 1996). 
U.S. imports ofsaccharin have steadily declined from 5.9 million lb (2, 700 Mg) in 1983 to 
3.7 million lb (1, 700 Mg) in 1984, about 1.8 million lb (817 Mg) in 1985, and 1.6 million lb (726 
Mg) in 1987 (NTP, 1994). Calcium saccharin was first produced commercially in the United 
States in 1953. 
Saccharin is manufactured commercially by both the Maumee process and the Remsen­
Fahlberg method. In the United States, saccharin and sodium saccharin are produced 
commercially only by the Maumee process (HSDB, 1996), and have been produced for over 80 
years (Crammer and Ikan, 1977; cited by IARC, 1980). In the Maumee process, diazotization of 
methyl anthranilate by treatment with sodium nitrate and hydrochloric acid gives 2­
carbomethoxy-benzenediazonium chloride. Sulfonation ofthis intermediate gives 2­
carbomethyoxy-benzenesulfonic acid, which is treated with chlorine to give 2-carbomethoxy­
benzenesulfonyl chloride with chlorine. Treatment ofthis sulfonyl chloride with ammonia, 
followed by acidification, gives saccharin (!ARC, 1980). Saccharin is converted to the sodium 
salt by treating with sodium hydroxide or sodium bicarbonate. Twenty-three impurities have 
been reported in this process (Arnold et al., 1983). 
In the Remsen-Fahlberg method ofproducing saccharin, toluene is reacted with 
chlorosulfonic acid to produce o-and p-toluenesulfonyl chlorides. The o-isomer is isolated and 
treated with ammonia to form o-toluenesulfonamide. Oxidation gives o-sulfamoylbenzoic acid, 
and when this intermediate is heated, saccharin forms (IARC, 1980). Thirty-one impurities have 
been reported when saccharin is synthesized by this method (Arnold et al., 1983).

NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
2.2 Use 
The primary use of saccharin is as a nonnutritive sweetening agent. Its use increased 
substantially after cyclamates (synthetic chemicals having a sweet taste) were banned in food in 
1969 (FESA database). In 1976, the estimated U.S. consumption for all forms ofsaccharin was 
77% in food uses ( 45% in soft drinks; 18% in tabletop sweeteners; 14% in fruit juices, sweets, 
chewing gum, and jellies), and 23% in non-food uses (10% in cosmetics and oral hygiene 
products, such as toothpastes, mouthwash, and lipstick; 7% in drugs, such as coatings on pills; 
2% in smokeless tobacco products, such as chewing tobacco and snuff; 2% in electroplating, e.g., 
a brightener in nickel-plating baths used in the coating ofautomobile bumpers; I% for cattle feed; 
and I% in miscellaneous uses (IARC, I980; HSDB, I996). 
The original uses of saccharin were numerous. A few ofthe original uses were as an 
antiseptic and preservative to retard fermentation in food, in estimating the circulation time of 
blood from an antecubital vein to the lingual capillaries, as an antistatic agent in plastics and 
textiles, as a polymer modifier and accelerator in photosensitive dispersions, as a light-fastness 
aid in nylon dyes, and as a chemical intermediate for the fungicide probenazole used in controlling 
rice blast in Japan (Arnold et al., I983). 
Based upon government legislation and market competition, the consumption ofsaccharin 
in the United States has varied. Saccharin and saccharin salts were approved under the I958 
Food Additives Amendment to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act. Under the provisions ofthis 
act, saccharin was included in those substances that had been in use prior to 1958 and had been 
accorded GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) status. Saccharin was removed from the GRAS 
list in I972, however, when questions by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about its 
safety arose (IARC, I980). During the period when saccharin was recognized as having GRAS 
status, its consumption increased dramatically. For example, the consumption of saccharin in the 
United States in I953 was 21,000 lb (9.5 Mg); in I962, 2.5 million lb (I,IOO Mg); and following 
the ban on cyclamates in I969, consumption rose to 4.0 million lb (1,800 Mg) (Arnold et al., 
I983). The approval and introduction ofother artificial sweeteners such as aspartame and 
acesulfame-K into the U. S. market lowered the annual per capita consumer consumption of 
saccharin from 3.5 kg (9.6 mg/day) in I980 to 2.7 kg (7.4 mg/day) in both I985 and I988 (lrving­
Monshaw, I989). The total U.S. consumption of saccharin in I992 was 700,000 sugar 
sweetness equivalent tons (2,333 Mg) whereas aspartame's consumption was I,500 sugar 
sweetness equivalent tons (8,333 Mg) (Research Studies-USDA ERS, I992). According to SRI 
International, saccharin accounted for 39% ofthe world's consumption ofhigh-intensity 
sweeteners in I992, while aspartame accounted for 41% (Dawson, 1994b ). The I994 consumer 
consumption of saccharin was estimated to be 2,200 Mg in the United States and I,I 00 Mg in 
Europe (Dawson, I994a). 
In I983, the Calorie Control Council estimated that in the United States, 44 million adults 
consumed saccharin-sweetened products (NTP, I994). It has been estimated that the average 
consumption ofsaccharin by humans in the United States is about 5 mglkg body weight/day 
(Vesely and Levey, 1978). Saccharin consumption is greatest among diabetics and others whose 
medical conditions require the restriction ofcalories or carbohydrates (NTP, 1994 ).

2.3 Environmental Exposure 
2.3.1 Environmental Releases 
The Toxic Chemical Release Inventory (EPA) listed four industrial facilities that 
produced, processed, or otherwise used saccharin in 1988. In compliance with Community 
Right-to-Know Program, the facilities reported releases ofsaccharin to the environment which 
were estimated to total 750 lb (340.5 kg) (NTP, 1994). Facilities are required to notify the 
National Response Center (NRC) when release ofsaccharin equals or exceeds its reportable 
quantity of 100 lb (45.4 kg). When saccharin becomes a waste, as a commercial chemical 
product, a manufacturing chemical intermediate, an off-specification commercial chemical 
product, or a manufacturing chemical intermediate, it must be managed according to Federal 
and/or State hazardous waste regulations (HSDB, 1996). 
Releases ofsaccharin to the environment as reported by PMC Specialties Group, the 
only U.S. commercial saccharin producer listed by the USITC and Cumberland-Swan, Inc., the 
manufacturer of Sweet 'n Low®, are listed below, in Table 2-2.

2.3.2 Environmental Occurrence 
Saccharin and its salts, as well as the impurity o-toluenesulfonamide, do not occur as 
natural products (IARC, 1980).

NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
2.3.3 Drinking Water and Food 
Refer to section 2.3.4 for any information regarding exposure to saccharin from food. 
2.3.4 Consumer Products 
Potential exposure to saccharin also occurs through the consumption ofdietetic foods and 
drinks and some personal hygiene products, such as certain toothpastes and mouthwashes that 
use saccharin as a sweetening agent (NTP, 1994). The FDA has authorized the use of saccharin 
and its salts in beverages in concentrations not to exceed 12 mg/oz (413 mg!L), as a sugar 
substitute not to exceed 20 mg for each expressed teaspoonful of sugar sweetening equivalency, 
and in processed food not to exceed 30 mg per serving. Data from the Nationwide Food 
Consumption Survey, conducted by the USDA from 1977-1978, on calculated daily saccharin 
intake levels is presented in Table 2-3. The survey included responses from 30,770 U.S. 
residents from the 48 contiguous states. Respondents reported foods eaten and quantities 
consumed.

The amount of saccharin consumed by diabeti~s in Great Britain was estimated in a study 
conducted by researchers at the University of Southampton (MAFF, 1994). The highest level 
consumed (as measured by the 97.5th percentile) was 3.1 mg saccharin per kilogram body weight 
per day. The study included 761 participants, age 2 years and over. The average consumption 
of saccharin by diabetics was not provided. 
Consumer exposure to saccharin has possibly decreased in recent years due to the 
introduction ofNutra-Sweet® (aspartame). According to SRI International, saccharin, packaged 
as an artificial sweetener under the product name Sweet 'n Low®, commands 31.8% ofthe U.S. 
market share in artificial tabletop sweeteners. Saccharin is second to aspartame, which 
commands 67.8% ofthe market share (Tomasula, 1994). 
2.3.5 Biomarkers of Exposure 
Saccharin has not been found to be mutagenic, and evidence shows it does not undergo 
covalent binding to the DNA of a rat's liver or bladder (Lutz and Schlatter, 1977).

NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
2.3.6 Occupational Exposure 
Occupational exposure occurs through dermal contact or inhalation ofdust at places 
where saccharin is produced or used. The risk of potential occupational exposure exists for 
workers involved in the production of saccharin or its salts, in the manufacture and formulation 
of saccharin-containing products, and during the packaging of the consumer products. A National 
Occupational Exposure Survey (1981-1983) estimated that 225,095 total workers, including 
97,729 women, representing 73 occupations in 107 industries at 7,347 facilities, potentially were 
exposed to saccharin (NIOSH, 1990). This survey also found 1,150 employees, including 591 
women, representing 5 occupations in 1 industry at 11 facilities were potentially exposed to its 
sodium salt. This same survey found 10,053 employees, including 4,418 females, representing 
16 occupations in 19 industries at 454 facilities that either were involved with the production of, 
dealt with, or were potentially exposed to sodium saccharin dihydrate (RTECS, 1996).

2.4 Regulations 
2.4.1 Occupational Exposure Limits 
No occupational standards or criteria have been promulgated (OSHA) or recommended 
(NIOSH, ACGIH) in the United States for exposure to saccharin in workroom air. 
2.4.2 Other Standards and Criteria 
The EPA regulates saccharin and its salts under the Comprehensive Environmental 
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), Resource Conservation and Recovery 
Act (RCRA), and Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA). Saccharin is 
subject to reporting and record keeping rules under CERCLA, RCRA, and SARA. The EPA 
proposed raising the statutory reportable quantity (RQ) of 1 lb, established under CERCLA, to 
100 lb for saccharin and its salts. The final rule adjusts the RQ from 1 lb to 100 lb. Saccharin is 
regulated as a hazardous constituent ofwaste under RCRA, and threshold amounts for facilities 
which may release saccharin have been established under SARA. OSHA regulates saccharin 
under the Hazard Communication Standard and as a chemical hazard in laboratories. The FDA 
regulates saccharin under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&CA) as a food ingredient not to 
exceed specific concentrations (NTP, 1994). In compliance with the Delaney Clause, the FDA 
proposed to ban saccharin as a food additive in 1977 because ofthe available evidence ofits 
carcinogenicity in animals. Due to conflicting scientific study results as well as the potential 
benefits of saccharin, a compromise solution was enacted instead ofan outright ban. In 
November, 1977, Congress passed the Saccharin Study and Labeling Act which placed an 18­
month moratorium on any action by the FDA against saccharin, and mandated that all products 
containing saccharin bear the following warning label: "Use ofthis product may be hazardous to 
your health. This product contains saccharin, which has been determined to cause cancer in 
laboratory animals" (Viscusi, 1994). In 1991, the FDA withdrew its call for an outright ban on 
saccharin in the United States, but warning labels are still required on all packaging (Tomasula, 
1994). The moratorium against any further FDA action has been extended to May 1, 1997. 
FDA regulates, under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&CA) and the Fair Packaging and 
Labeling Act, the labeling ofvarious food products containing saccharin and/or saccharin salts. 
The FDA also regulates how saccharin and certain saccharin salts are used as sweetening agents in 
food and as a weight control drug under the FD&CA and the Public Health Service Act.

3.0 HUMAN STUDIES 
A number ofepidemiological studies have been conducted to determine whether the use of 
artificial sweeteners (AS), including saccharin, has been associated with human cancer. U.S. 
epidemiological studies of AS may not be as informative as those from Canada, the United 
Kingdom, Europe, and Japan, where widespread saccharin use first began (1945 [imported 
primarily from Japan and the United States], 1916, 1894, and 1945, respectively). Artificial 
sweetener use in the United States was not widespread until the middle ofthe 1960s, when 
cyclamate and saccharin were used together. The IARC Working Group reviewed saccharin 
epidemiology in the original monograph (IARC, 1980) and updated the review in Supplement 7 
to the IARC Monographs (IARC, 1987b). In both reviews by the IARC Working Group, it was 
concluded that the results from epidemiological studies ofsaccharin are equivocal. In a review of 
saccharin by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA, 1993), 
however, it was concluded that "the epidemiological studies on saccharin did not show any 
evidence that saccharin ingestion increases the incidence ofbladder cancer in human populations". 
Epidemiologic studies have in general examined associations between urinary bladder 
cancer and artificial sweeteners in general, rather than saccharin, per se; this could either inflate or 
disguise a risk due to saccharin alone. Time trend data are essentially uninformative, since 
information concerning use ofartificial sweeteners and confounding factors is presented only for 
populations and not for individuals. Cohort studies of diabetics are confounded by reduced 
smoking in this group. Overall, case-control studies demonstrate at best a small risk for the 
general population (reviewed in IARC, 1980; IARC, 1987a,b; JECFA, 1993). However, some 
studies have demonstrated increased risk for groups otherwise at low risk, such as female 
nonsmokers (Howe et al., 1980; Hoover and Strasser, 1980; Cartwright et al., 1981; Morrison et 
al, 1982; Mommsen et al., 1983). Heavy users of artificial sweeteners may also be at increased 
19 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
risk regardless ofgender or smoking habits (Hoover and Strasser, 1980). While the available 
epidemiology data show no consistent evidence that saccharin is associated with increased 
bladder cancer in general, a small increased risk in some subgroups cannot be excluded. 
3.1 IARC (1980) Review of Saccharin Epidemiology 
IARC (1980, pp. 171-183; see Appendix A) examined time trends in the United States, 
England, and Wales and found that there was no marked increase in the incidence ofbladder 
cancer following rapid increase in the use ofartificial sweeteners (e.g., see Armstrong and Doll, 
1974). In addition, the IARC Working Group found that in the United Kingdom diabetics as a 
group consume higher quantities of artificial sweeteners and experience lower mortality from 
bladder cancer than the general population (e.g., see Armstrong and Doll, 1975). The IARC 
Working Group stated that due to metabolic or dietary differences, use ofdrugs, exposure to 
tobacco, or occupational factors associated with diabetics, a carcinogenic effect of sweeteners 
cannot be excluded (IARC, 1980). 
The IARC Working Group evaluated 7 case-control studies (Morgan and Jain, 1974; 
Simonet al., 1975; Howe et al., 1977; Wynder and Goldsmith, 1977; Miller et al., 1978; 
Connolly et al, 1978; Kessler and Clark, 1978). Five ofthe seven studies were negative for 
bladder cancer and were found to be limited by some inadequacies in experimental design. Ofthe 
two studies that examined possible confounding factors in detail, one (Howe et al., 1980 [a 
reanalysis of data from Howe et al., 1977]) suggested that artificial sweetener use was positively 
associated with bladder cancer in men but not in women. The association was limited to men 
who consumed an average ofmore than eight tablets of saccharin per day or men who used nine 
or more tablets ofAS per day. In both instances, the relative risk (RR) was approximately 3. 
The IARC Working Group noted that in these small groups, the result could have been due to 
confounding factors that were not included in the analysis, residual confounding effects ofthose 
factors that were considered in the analysis, or chance. 
The second study reviewed by the IARC Working Group that considered confounding 
factors (Kessler and Clark, 1978; cited by IARC, 1980) found no association between bladder 
cancer and use ofAS and suggested that a relative risk ofabout 1.5 or higher was unlikely. 
In 6 out of7 ofthe case-control studies reviewed by the IARC Working Group, women 
with bladder cancer consumed less AS than the controls. The IARC Working Group stated that 
this observation suggests that there is no association between use of artificial sweeteners and 
bladder cancer in women. 
In a case-control study that was in press when reviewed by IARC (1980), Wynder and 
Stellman (1980) reported that there was no association between use of artificial sweeteners or 
diet beverages and bladder cancer. The study included 302 male and 65 female bladder cancer 
patients who were matched by age, sex, hospital, and hospital-room status to an equal number of 
patients without bladder cancer. More details on this study after publication are given in 
subsection 3 .2.1. 
The 1980 IARC Working Group concluded their review of epidemiological data for AS 
with the following statement: The epidemiological data taken as a whole cannot with confidence 
exclude a small increase in risk but provide no clear evidence that artificial sweeteners cause 
bladder cancer in humans (IARC, 1980). In 1987, the IARC Working Group reiterated the 
20 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
findings from their 1980 review by concluding that the evidence that the risk ofcancer is 
increased among users ofartificial sweeteners is inconsistent (IARC, 1987). 
3.2 Human Studies Published Post IARC (1980) 
Experimental details for the studies described in this section are presented in Table 3-1. 
3.2.1 U.S. Case-Control Studies 
Hoover and Strasser (1980) conducted a large multicenter bladder cancer case-control 
study that included 3010 newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed bladder cancer cases and 
5783 population-based controls chosen at random. Information collected by personal interview 
included information regarding quantity ofAS consumed, either by table-top or diet-drink use. 
No increase in overall RR for bladder tumors was found when comparing the use ofAS with 
never having used AS (males: RR = 0.99; CI [Confidence Interval] = 0.89-1.1 0; females: RR = 
1.07; CI = 0.89-1.29). There was no trend found for men for either table-top or diet-drink AS 
use. A statistically significant trend for table-top, but not diet-drink, consumption was observed 
for females after adjustment for age, race, and cigarette smoking. For men and women who 
consumed at least 2 diet drinks and 3 table-top servings/day or at least some diet drinks and at 
least 6 table-top servings/day, there was a borderline statistically significant RR of 1.45 (CI = 
1.00-2.10) after adjustment for sex, age, race, smoking, occupational exposures, region, and 
education (for males the RR was 1.47; for females the RR was 1.41). Two subgroups-females 
who had never smoked or been occupationally exposed to known bladder carcinogens and men 
who smoked heavily--showed a statistically significant relative risk estimate with daily AS use 
(men: table-top 2::6 uses, RR = 1.86; diet drinks 2::3 servings, RR = 2.62; women: table-top 2::2 
uses for 2::5-9 years, RR = 1.8; 2::2 uses >10 years RR = 2.7). Additional control for coffee 
drinking, history of geographic area, education, obesity, use ofhair dyes, and history ofurinary 
infections did not affect the relative risk. [IARC (1982) reviewed this study in Supplement 4 to 
the monographs.] 
Using a different analytic approach, Walker et al. (1982) reevaluated the study conducted 
by Hoover and Strasser (1980) and found essentially the same overall result for AS use (RR = 
1.2; CI = 1.0-1.5). These investigators used a composite variable that included education, bladder 
infection, job exposure, and coffee consumption to define baseline risk strata. Odds ratio 
estimates were adjusted for region, race, sex, and age. The authors found no trends in odds ratios 
associated with increasing AS use for the different risk categories. However, this reanalysis was 
criticized by Hoover and Hartge (1982; cited by IARC, 1987b), who argued that the use of 
stratification did not include sex and age, and suggested that the low- or high-risk groups based on 
the composite risk variable used in the reanalysis were actually of intermediate risk. [IARC 
(1982) mentioned these two studies in Supplement 4.] 
Morrison and Buring ( 1980) reported an association ofartificial sweetener use and 
increased risk of lower urinary tract cancer in females. The relative risk of lower urinary tract 
cancer was 1.6 (95% CI = 0.9-2.7; 69 cases/46 controls) among women who never used dietetic 
beverages, and 1.5 (95% CI = 0.9-2.6; 54 cases/39 controls) among women who reported use of 
sugar substitutes. There was also an increased lower urinary tract cancer risk among women after 
five or more years ofdietetic beverage use (RR = 3.7; 22 cases/6 controls), but statistical 
21 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
estimates were not provided. [This study was described by IARC (1980) as a footnote since it 
was published after the Working Group Meeting.] 
A case-control study was conducted by Wynder and Stellman (1980) between 1977 and 
1979 using 302 male and 65 female cases with bladder cancer. Controls were hospital admissions 
matched for sex, age, hospital, and hospital-room status (an indicator of socioeconomic status). 
The authors found no association between use of saccharin or diet beverages and bladder cancer. 
The RR for saccharin use was 0.93 (CI = 0.68-1.28) for men and 0.62 (CI = 0.26-1.40) for 
women. For diet beverage consumption, the RR was 0.85 (CI = 0.55-1.17) for men and 0.60 
(CI = 0.27-1.29) for women. [This study was published after the Working Group meeting and 
was described in IARC (1980) as a footnote.] 
Najem et al. (1982) compared 75 male and female bladder cancer cases with 142 hospital­
based controls in a study conducted in 1978 in New Jersey. Controls were matched to cases by 
age, place of birth, sex, race, source ofobtaining cases, and place of current residence. The 
authors found no statistically significant increased risk ofbladder cancer from consumption of 
saccharin (RR = 1.3 [CI = 0.6-2.8]). However, only 12/75 cases (16%) and 19/142 controls 
(13%), reported having consumed saccharin. The relative risk was not adjusted for any 
potentially confounding factors. 
Silverman et al. (1983) examined the use ofpopulation- versus hospital-based controls to 
estimate the risk of lower urinary tract cancer from AS consumption. The study was conducted 
in Detroit, MI as an add-on to the multicenter study conducted by Hoover and Strasser (1980). 
The study included 391 cases diagnosed from December 1977 to December 1978 in Detroit with 
transitional or squamous cell carcinoma oflower urinary tract, 305 population-based controls 
matched to cases by age and sex, and 440 hospital-based controls discharged from the same 
hospital as a case and matched by age, race, sex, discharge date. Population-based controls had a 
lower reported AS use compared with hospital-based controls. Using population-based controls, 
the RRs for men and women were 1.1 and 1.8, respectively. Using hospital-based controls, the 
RRs for men and women were 0.9 and 1.1, respectively. Using hospital controls without 
obesity-related diseases, RR was 1.1 for both men and women. Adjustment of RR values for age, 
smoking, education, and body mass index were found to have no effect on risk. 
A New York state study reported no increased risk of bladder cancer for young (20 to 49 
yr-old) women who reported using AS more than 100 times (Odds Ratio [OR]= 1.1 [CI = 0.7­
1.7]). Cases (173) with bladder cancer diagnosed between 1975 and 1980 were matched by sex, 
age, and residence within an area code to 173 population-based controls (Piper et al., 1986). 
In a study conducted by Nomura et al. (1991), men and women of Japanese or Caucasian 
ancestry, diagnosed with lower urinary tract cancer between 1977 and 1986 in Oahu were 
matched to population-based controls by sex, ethnic group, age, and residence. Participants were 
classified into non-users and users of saccharin based on consumption history 1 year prior to 
interview or diagnosis. There was no increased risk of lower urinary tract cancer in users (OR for 
men, 1.1 [CI = 0.7-1.8]; OR for women, 0.7 [CI = 0.3-1.5]). 
In an analysis ofdata from the Hoover and Strasser (1980) study conducted by Sturgeon 
et al. (1994), it was found that heavy use of AS(;;::: 1680 mg/day) was associated with higher­
grade, poorly differentiated bladder tumors (RR = 2.2; CI = 1.3-3.6). The analysis included 1860 
cases from 10 geographic regions with bladder cancer identified between December 1977 and 
22 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
March 1978, and 3934 population-based controls. The RR was adjusted for age, sex, cigarette 
use, history of urinary infection or bladder stones, coffee consumption, family history of urinary 
tract cancer, high-risk occupation, race, and education. 
3 .2.2 Canadian Case-Control Studies 
Risch et al. (1988) conducted a large multicenter Canadian bladder cancer study that 
matched 826 cases with population-based controls during 1979-1982. No association with any 
table-top AS consumption, including a subgroup of nonsmoking females (OR= 1.04; CI = 0.4­
2.71) was reported. An 0 R of approximately 2 was associated with females that drank diet 
soda; the dose-related trend reached borderline statistical significance. The authors noted that 
none ofthe diet soda consumption had exceeded 10 years (Risch et al., 1988). Thus, these 
authors failed to confirm the increased risk for bladder cancer that they previously reported 
(Howe et al., 1980) for consumers of artificial sweeteners. 
3.2.3 Case-Control Studies From Other Countries 
Morrison et al. (1982) conducted a case control study including cases of lower urinary 
tract cancer cases from Nagoya, Japan (293 cases) and Manchester, United Kingdom (555 cases). 
Controls (589 Japanese, 735 British) were population-based and were matched to cases by age 
and sex. The study found no increased risk of lower urinary tract cancer related to AS use 
(British men, RR = 0.9 [CI = 0.7-1.2]; British women, RR = 0.9 [CI = 0.6-1.4]; Japanese men, 
RR = 0.7 [CI = 0.5-0.9]; Japanese women, RR = 0.5 [CI = 0.3-0.8]). The study populations from 
Japan and the United Kingdom used saccharin predominantly (97% of British, 94% ofJapanese) 
for 30-40 years prior to the study. The authors found an increased RR of 1.6 among nonsmoking 
men from the United Kingdom; the RR for nonsmoking British women was 1.2. There was no 
increased risk in nonsmoking Japanese or in any group of current or former smokers. The United 
Kingdom analysis for AS in tablets showed an increased RR among the over-1 0-tablets-a-day 
female group (RR = 2.3) and a decrease in males (RR = 0.6). 
Another study from the United Kingdom, conducted by Cartwright et al. (1981), included 
622 prevalent and 219 incident cases of bladder cancer in West Yorkshire, each ofwhich was 
matched to hospital-based controls (622 for existing cases, 448 for new cases) for age and sex. 
Saccharin use was described as regular for> 1 year, at least 5 years prior to diagnosis. Risk was 
significantly elevated for nonsmoking males (RR = 2.2 [CI = 1.3-3.8]), but not for nonsmoking 
females (RR = 1.6 [CI = 0.8-3.2]), or for smokers of either sex (male RR = 0.9 [CI = 0.6-1.3]; 
female RR = 1.2 [CI = 0.5-2.6]). The RR values were adjusted for age and type ofcase (incident 
or prevalent). 
Mommsen et al. (1983) conducted a small case-control study from Denmark comprised of 
4 7 female cases newly diagnosed with bladder cancer and 94 population-based controls matched 
by sex, age, and geographic area, including degree ofurbanization. Cases were interviewed in 
person at the hospital, whereas controls received a mailed questionnaire which was followed up 
by a phone interview. Only 6/4 7 cases and 2/94 controls reported consumption of saccharin. An 
elevated risk ofbladder cancer was found for all women who had consumed saccharin (RR = 6.7 
[CI = 1.5-30.2]). When only nonsmokers who used saccharin were included, the risk decreased 
(RR = 3.3 [CI = 1.4-7.8]). 
23 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
In another study from Denmark, however, M0ller-Jensen et al. (1983) found no increased 
risk of bladder cancer from consumption ofsaccharin (RR for men= 0.68 [CI = 0.45-1.02]; RR 
for women= 1.04 [CI = 0.51-2.09]). The study included 290 male and 98 female bladder cancer 
patients who were matched by age and sex to 592 male and 195 female controls selected at 
random from the general population. Participants were classified as users of saccharin only 
(72.9%), cyclamate only (10.7%), or both substances. 
A case-control study using 117 cases with 117 population-based controls and 117 
hospital-based controls was prompted following a report ofhigh bladder cancer incidence in La 
Plata, Argentina. However, no association between saccharin use and bladder cancer was 
reported. Controls were matched to cases by sex, age, and residence (population-based controls) 
or hospital (hospital-based controls). Relative risk values were not provided (lscovich et al., 
1987). 
No increased risk ofbladder cancer from consumption ofsaccharin (as a food additive 
only) was found in a case-control study conducted by Momas et al. (1994) (OR= 1.5 [CI = 0.8­
3 .0]). The study included 219 men living in a region of France for > 5 years and diagnosed with 
primary bladder carcinoma between January 1987 and May 1989. The 794 controls were men 
from the same region who were over 50 years old and had lived in the region > 5 years. Saccharin 
use was defined as consumption of365 (units were not given). 
3.2.4 Descriptive Studies 
Jensen and Kamby (1982) found that in utero exposure to saccharin did not appear to 
increase the bladder cancer incidence in the first 3 decades of life, which was the limitation of 
their follow-up. This Danish study also found no increased incidence in bladder cancer mortality 
up to an age of 30 years for persons born from 1941 to 1945, which corresponds to a time period 
when saccharin use was high in Denmark due to war-time shortages of sugar. 
3.2.5 Meta-Analysis 
In a meta-analysis that included 12 case-control studies on the relationship between AS 
and bladder cancer incidence, Elcock and Morgan (1993) estimated a summary RR ofnear unity 
(males, 0.958; females; 0.961).

4.0 MAMMALIAN CARCINOGENICITY 
Several conventional carcinogenicity studies ofdietary sodium saccharin have been 
conducted in rats. Four of these studies that meet contemporary standards for hazard 
identification, including absence ofurinary bladder parasites, have shown induction ofneoplasia 
in urinary bladder urothelium ofmale rats. A condition that appears to be necessary for positive 
results is exposure to high doses of sodium saccharin close to the time ofweaning with continued 
exposure for two years. In four studies ofup to 30 months duration, sodium saccharin was 
carcinogenic in Charles River CD and Sprague- Dawley male rats as evidenced by a dose-related 
increased incidence ofbenign or malignant urinary bladder neoplasms at dietary concentrations of 
1% or greater (Tisdel et al., 1974; Arnold et al., 1980; Taylor et al., 1980; Schoenig et al., 1985) 
and statistically significant increased bladder neoplasia at 4% or greater (Schoenig et al., 1985; 
Squire, 1985). Non-statistically significant increases in urinary bladder cancer have also been seen 
in saccharin-treated female rats from studies showing a positive effect in males (Arnold et al., 
1980; Taylor et al., 1980). Furthermore, several initiation/promotion studies in different rat 
strains have shown a reduced latency and/or increased incidence of similar urinary bladder cancers 
in male and female rats fed sodium saccharin subsequent to treatment with different urinary 
bladder initiators (e.g., Hicks and Chowaniec, 1977; Cohen et al., 1979; Nakanishi et al., 1980b; 
West et al., 1986; Fukushima et al., 1990). Several additional rat studies in which sodium 
saccharin was administered either in the diet or in drinking water were negative for tumorigenicity 
(Fitzhugh et al., 1951; Lessel, 1971; Schmahl, 1973; Chowaniec and Hicks, 1979; Hooson et al., 
1980; Schmahl and Habs, 1984). 
Conventional carcinogenicity studies of dietary sodium saccharin in mice have been less 
rigorously carried out, and have been negative for urinary bladder carcinogenesis. On the other 
hand, two studies in which saccharin-containing cholesterol pellets were surgically implanted into 
the urinary bladders of mice have yielded urinary bladder cancers. Three mouse studies have 
reported positive carcinogenicity following exposure to saccharin. Two ofthese studies involved 
surgical implantation ofsaccharin-containing cholesterol pellets into the urinary bladders and 
resulted in development ofmalignant urothelial neoplasms (Allen et al., 1957; Bryan et al., 1970). 
In the third study, dietary sodium saccharin resulted in increased incidences ofmalignant thyroid 
neoplasms (Prasad and Rai, 1986). While the mouse data cannot be discounted, some ofthese 
studies had methodological flaws, provided limited information, did not show a dose-response, or 
had unexpected outcomes that may be species or strain-specific and should be verified by 
additional studies. Four studies in mice were judged negative for tumorigenesis (Roe et al., 1970; 
Kroes et al., 1977; Hornberger, 1978; Frederick et al., 1989) as were studies in nonhuman 
primates (McChesney et al., 1977 abstr.; Sieber and Adamson, 1978; both cited by IARC, 1980; 
Thorgiersson et al., 1994; Cohen et al., 1996 abstr.) and a single hamster study (Althoffet al., 
1975). 
4.1 Mammalian Carcinogenicity of Saccharin 
Full experimental details for the studies described in this section are presented in 
Table 4-1. 
35 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
4.1.1 IIamsters 
No urinary tract tumors were observed in Syrian golden hamsters exposed to 0.156­
1.25% sodium saccharin in drinking water for life (50-60 weeks). The incidence oftumors in 
other tissues was within the range of spontaneously occurring tumors (Althoff et al., 1975). 
4.1.2 Mice 
Twenty-five days after application of saccharin to the skin (8% solution in acetone), "S" 
strain mice were given 18 weekly applications of0.17% croton oil in acetone. Following 
treatment with croton oil, 14 skin tumors were observed in 7/20 mice exposed to saccharin, while 
4 skin tumors were observed in 4/19 control mice treated with croton oil only. The difference 
was not significant (p value not given) (Salaman and Roe, 1956; cited by IARC, 1980). 
An increased incidence ofbladder cancer (p = 0.01; x2 test) was observed in "stock" mice 
that had saccharin/cholesterol pellets (2 mg saccharin/8 mg cholesterol) implanted in their urinary 
bladder lumina for 40 or 52 weeks (Allen et al., 1957). The authors noted that the presence of 
the cholesterol pellet in the bladder may have had a promoting action, and that the method of 
bladder implantation detects incomplete carcinogens. It was not specified whether other tissues 
were examined. The saccharin used was ofunknown purity and the study involved small 
numbers ofanimals whose sex was not specified. 
As part ofa combined carcinogenesis and tumor promotion study (Roe et al., 1970), 
female Swiss mice were given a 5% saccharin diet for 18 months. Based upon macroscopic 
examination of all major organs except brain, pituitary, and spinal cord, there were no alterations 
in gross lesions or tumor incidences in saccharin-treated mice. The necropsy included careful 
macroscopic examination ofurinary bladder. 
Stoner et al. (1973; cited by IARC, 1980) found that intraperitoneal (i.p.) saccharin 
exposure (8 weeks, 0.6 or 3.3 g/kg/day) of Allie mice was not associated with induction of 
pulmonary tumors. No other organs were examined. In a 6 generation study, Kroes et al. (1977) 
found that the incidence ofurinary bladder carcinoma was not significantly increased in Swiss 
SPF mice exposed to 0.2 or 0.5% saccharin diet for 21 months. It was not specified whether 
other tissues were examined. 
A second cholesterol:saccharin (4:1) pellet implantation study in female Swiss mice 
significantly increased the incidence ofurinary bladder carcinomas but not in the degree of 
malignancy in mice living more than 175 days after bladder implantation versus controls 
(cholesterol pellet implants only) (Bryan et al., 1970). Since all ofthe saccharin was removed 
from the implanted pellets within 1.5 days and the cholesterol plus saccharin pellet was porous, 
having lost 20% of its weight, it has been argued that the cholesterol: saccharin pellet was 
different and perhaps more irritating than the pellet comprised ofonly cholesterol and, 
furthermore, there is some concern regarding how closely pellet implantation resembles chronic 
oral exposure to saccharin (Cranmer, 1980). 
The incidence oftransitional-cell bladder cancers, lung tumors, hepatomas, or lymphomas 
was not significantly increased in Charles River CD mice exposed to a 1 or 5% sodium saccharin 
diet for up to 2 years (IIomburger, 1978). Any tissue with an abnormal appearance and all vital 
organs from at least half ofthe animals were examined histologically.

Prasad and Rai (1986) orally administered albino mice 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 g/kg saccharin 
(purity not specified) dissolved in 1 mL of distilled water for 1 yr, beginning at 6 weeks ofage. 
Papillary adenocarcinoma ofthe thyroid was found in male (5/10) and female (3/10) mice exposed 
to the highest dose. The tumors were detected during months 9-12 ofthe experiment and were 
malignant in nature; metastases were found in the lungs. No information was provided on gross 
or microscopic examinations ofthe bladder. Although a control group was used (10 males, 10 
females), the tumor incidence in these mice was not reported. The saccharin used in this study 
was purchased from Boots Co., Bombay, India. 
In female weanling BALB/c mice administered a 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, or 5.0% sodium saccharin 
diet for 117 weeks, there was a marginally significant dose-response (p = 0.04) in the incidence of 
Harderian neoplasms (27/163, 32/172,29/160, 22/132, and 22/84, respectively). There was no 
significant increase, however, for bladder, liver, breast, adrenal, or lung tumors, or for reticulum 
cell sarcoma or lymphoma in any dose group (Frederick et al., 1989). Neither the authors nor the 
NTP staff consider the Harderian gland response to be biologically significant. 
4.1.3 Rats 
Seven of 18, 21-day-old Osborne-Mendel rats exposed to a 5% saccharin diet for up to 2 
years developed abdominal lymphosarcomas (Fitzhugh et al., 1951 ). The authors stated that this 
was not "out of line with the incidence (of abdominal lymphosarcomas) in a comparable group of 
rats", but noted an uncommon co-occurrence ofthoracic lymphosarcomas with abdominal 
lymphosarcomas in 4 ofthe 7 rats treated for 102 or more weeks. Urinary bladders were not 
evaluated. Although controls were used in this study, the control tumor incidence was not 
provided. IARC (1980) reviewed Fitzhugh et al. (1951) and noted the small number ofanimals 
exposed. 
Saccharin was negative for tumorigenesis in male and female Boots- Wistar rats exposed to 
a 0.005, 0.05, 0.5, or 5% saccharin diet for 2 years. Of 4 rats exposed to the highest dose and 
examined histologically, 1 female had a bladder papilloma (Lessel, 1971). IARC (1980) noted the 
small number ofbladders examined histologically. It was not specified whether other tissues 
were examined. 
There was no increase in the incidence ofbenign and malignant mesenchymal tumors or of 
bladder tumors in 70-to 90-day-old BD rats exposed to 0.2 or 0.5% sodium saccharin in the diet 
for up to 30 months (Schmahl, 1973; cited by IARC, 1980). It was not specified whether other 
tissues were examined. 
In a two-generation study, the incidence ofbladder cancer was not increased in F 1 male or 
female Charles River CD rats exposed to 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, or 5% sodium saccharin for up to 28 
months. However, the incidence ofurinary bladder transitional-cell neoplasms in F 1 male rats 
exposed to a 7.5% sodium saccharin diet for up to 28 months was significantly increased when 
compared to controls (7/23 vs. 1/29 in controls). In addition, there were 2/31 urinary bladder 
neoplasms in F1 females exposed to 7.5% saccharin versus 0/24 in controls. The F0 parents were 
fed test diets from weaning, through mating, and through gestation to the weaning oftheir litters. 
The occurrence ofthe bladder neoplasms was not correlated with the presence ofbladder stones, 
and bladders were free ofparasites (Taylor et al., 1980). 
37 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
In a 2-generation study, there was an increased incidence oftransitional-cell carcinoma of 
the bladder in F1 male Sprague- Dawley rats fed 5% sodium saccharin in the diet for 100 weeks (7 
tumors in 20 exposed rats vs. 0 tumors in 20 controls). Carcinomas were not observed in the 
bladder offemale rats exposed similarly. Male and female rats fed a 0.05 or 0.5% sodium 
saccharin diet for 1 00 weeks did not show an increased incidence ofneoplasms at any site (Tisdel 
et al., 1974). 
Urinary bladder tumors were not observed in Wistar rats exposed to 2.5 g sodium 
saccharin/kg/day for up to 28 months (Furuya et al., 1975 abstr.). IARC (1980) noted the 
incomplete reporting of this study. 
Sodium saccharin was negative for urinary bladder tumorigenesis in male and female 
weanling Charles River CD rats exposed in the diet to 90, 270, 810, or 2430 mg sodium 
saccharin/kg/day for 26 months. Non-invasive bladder tumors were detected in 1/60 males and 
1/60 females exposed to 90 mglkg and in 2/60 males exposed to 810 mg/kg, but none were 
detected in the rats exposed to 2430 mg/kg. The authors found that the presence ofbladder 
calculi was not associated with exposure or the presence ofbladder tumors. The combined 
incidence oflymphomas and leukemias in males given the highest dose was 7/54 (vs. 2/57 in 
controls), but the statistical significance of this was not specified. All major tissues were 
examined (Munro et al., 1975). 
The incidences of tumors ofthe urinary bladder, pituitary, breast, and subcutaneous 
tissue were not increased in Charles River CD-I rats exposed to 1 or 5% sodium saccharin for up 
to 2 years. The authors noted that in 33% ofall examined urines, Trichosomoides crassicauda 
ova were found (Homburger, 1978). Any tissue with an abnormal appearance and all vital organs 
from at least half ofthe animals were examined histologically. 
Sodium saccharin had no significant effect on tumor incidence in Wistar SPF rats exposed 
to 4 g saccharin/kg body weight in the diet for 2 years. Although there was an increase in the 
total number of exposed males with tumors at any site (10170 males vs. 1/52 male controls), site­
specific tumor incidences were not statistically significant. Sodium saccharin also had no 
significant effect on tumor incidence in Wistar SPF rats exposed to 2 g saccharin/kg in drinking 
water for 2 years. There was an increase in the total number ofexposed males with tumors at any 
site (11171 males vs. 1152 male controls) in rats exposed to saccharin in drinking water, but site­
specific tumor incidences were not statistically significant. All major organs were examined 
macroscopically. The bladder, kidneys, lungs, liver, spleen, pancreas, ovaries, uterus, and any 
other organ with an abnormal appearance were examined histopathologically (Chowaniec and 
Hicks, 1979). 
In a two-generation study, the incidence of benign plus malignant bladder tumors was 
significantly increased (p < 0.03) in male Sprague- Dawley rats from both the F 0 and F 1 
generations (F0: 7/38 vs. 1/36 in controls; F1: 12/45 vs. 0/42 in controls). The F0 generation was 
exposed to a 5% sodium saccharin diet for 90 days prior to mating with continued lifetime 
exposure (up to 142 weeks), while the F1 pups were exposed for up to 127 weeks. The 
incidence of benign plus malignant bladder tumors was not statistically increased in F 0 and F 1 
females and there was no increase in the incidence oftumors ofother tissues in males or females. 
Two F 1 saccharin-dosed females, however, did have malignant urinary bladder tumors. All organs 
38 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
and all grossly abnormal areas ofdermal, supportive, or skeletal tissues were examined 
histologically (Arnold et al., 1980). 
As part of an initiation/promotion study (Hoosan et al., 1980), female Wistar rats were 
exposed to 2 g/kg/day of sodium saccharin in drinking water or in diet. There was no increase in 
urinary bladder neoplasms or other tumors in rats exposed to saccharin for two years. 
There was no statistically significant increase in tumor incidence in offspring ofpregnant 
Sprague-Dawley rats administered 0.2, 1, or 5 g saccharin/kg in aqueous solution by gavage on 
gestation days 14, 17, and 20. Offspring were fed normal diet and observed for life 
(approximately 2 years) or were killed when moribund. Complete necropsies were performed. 
All urinary bladders and any organs with macroscopically visible abnormalities were examined 
histologically (Schmahl and Habs, 1980). 
The incidence ofurinary bladder transitional cell papilloma was significantly increased in 
male ACI rats administered 5% sodium saccharin in the diet for 52 weeks beginning at 6 weeks of 
age (9/32 vs. 0/28 in controls, p < 0.01). Calculi were observed in 1 rat with bladder cancer and 
there was a higher level of urinary MgNH 4P0 4 crystals in treated rats than in controls. At least 
half ofthe rats were infected with the bladder parasite Trichosomoides crassicauda, which could 
have enhanced cell proliferation in the bladder. The bladder, liver, and kidneys were the only 
tissues examined histologically. Females were not included in the study (Fukushima et al., 1983). 
No tumors were detected in the bladder, liver, or kidneys ofmale F344, Sprague-Dawley, 
or Wistar rats administered 5% sodium saccharin in the diet for 52 weeks beginning at 6 weeks of 
age. Females were not evaluated (Fukushima et al., 1983). 
In a two-generation study, administration ofa mixture of 2 or 5% sodium saccharin and 
sodium cyclamate (1:10 ratio) in the diet ofSprague-Dawley rats was not carcinogenic. Full 
necropsies were performed, including evaluation ofthe urinary tract (Schmahl and Habs, 1984). 
In a large 2-generation study, F 0 rats were started on a test diet at 6 weeks of age; F 1 rats 
were started on the same test diet between 28 and 38 days of age. There was a clear dose 
response for urinary bladder tumors in F 1 male Charles River CD rats exposed to 1.0 to 7.5% 
sodium saccharin in the diet for up to 30 months (1.0%, 5/658; 3.0%, 8/472; 4.0%, 12/189; 5.0%, 
15/120; 6.25%, 20/120; 7.5%, 37/118; controls, 0/324) (Schoenig et al., 1985). Females were not 
evaluated in this study. The authors concluded a no-effect level for bladder tumors at the 1% 
dietary level based upon lack of statistical significance and historic control incidences at their 
laboratory. Following independent review ofthe urinary bladder lesions, Squire also concluded a 
no-effect level for bladder tumors at 1% (Squire, 1985). The bladder tumor incidence in rats 
exposed to 5% sodium saccharin only during gestation was 0/122, while that in rats exposed to 
5% sodium saccharin from birth for a single generation was 12/120 (Schoenig et al., 1985). The 
urinary bladder, urethra, ureter, kidneys, and all gross lesions and tissue masses were examined 
histologically (Schoenig et al., 1985). 
Bladder carcinomas and precancerous lesions were not observed in 6-week-old male 
analbuminemic (low level ofalbumin in the serum) Sprague- Dawley rats exposed to 5% sodium 
saccharin in the diet for 80 weeks (Homma et al., 1991). Only the bladder was examined.

4.1.4 Nonhuman Primates 
Histopathological examination of urinary bladders, kidneys, and testes of surviving and 
deceased male and female rhesus monkeys (exposed to 20, 100, or 500 mg saccharin/kg/day in the 
diet for 79 months) showed no abnormal pathology (McChesney et al., 1977 abstr.; cited by 
IARC, 1980). 
Sieber and Adamson (1978; cited by IARC, 1980) found that sodium saccharin was 
negative for gross neoplasia in monkeys ( 4 strains, not specified by IARC) exposed to 25 
mg/kg/day in the diet for 9 yr. This study was ongoing in 1980. 
Twenty 0 to 1-yr-old monkeys (Cynomolgus, Rhesus, and African Green were used but 
additional details were not provided) were exposed to 25 mg sodium saccharin/kg/day by mouth 
in water for at least 20 yr. Five monkeys died from either varicella, pneumonia, or unknown 
reasons. No tumors were found in the dead monkeys nor were there any indications oftumors in 
the 15 surviving monkeys. Complete necropsies were performed on all animals that died. 
Various unspecified hematological and biochemical tests were routinely performed on survivors 
(Thorgeirsson et al., 1994). 
Results from the surviving monkeys from the Thorgeirsson et al. (1994) study were 
subsequently reported (Cohen et al., 1996 abstr.). There were no calculi, unusual crystals, 
increased crystalluria, or calcium phosphate precipitate in urine ofcynomolgus and rhesus 
monkeys administered 25 mg sodium saccharin/kg/day for 17 to 23 years. Urine was analyzed 
during the last year oflife. There was no association between ingestion of sodium saccharin and 
urinary protein content. Urinary bladders were free of hyperplasia and tumors and scanning 
electron microscopy revealed no difference in the appearance ofthe urothelium in exposed and 
age-matched control monkeys (Cohen et al., 1996 abstr.). It was not specified in the abstract 
whether other tissues were examined.

4.2 Initiation/Promotion and Co-Carcinogenicity Studies 
Experimental details for the studies described in this section are presented in Table 4-2. 
4.2.1 Benzo[a]pyrene (BP) 
Saccharin did not enhance the incidence oftumors in the forestomach ofmice exposed to a 
test diet containing 5% saccharin (for 72 wk) starting 7 days after an initial single gastric 
instillation of0.2 mL polyethylene glycol containing 50 J..Lg BP. No pathological changes were 
observed macroscopically in urinary bladders of saccharin-exposed mice (Roe et al., 1970). It 
was noted that BP is not organotropic for the bladder and that histological examination ofthe 
urinary bladders was not conducted (IARC, 1980). 
4.2.2 N-Butyl-N-( 4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN) 
Sodium saccharin, administered in the diet at 0.04, 0.2, 1, or 5% for 32 wk, did not 
produce any effects in 6-wk-old Charles River F344 rats that were not pretreated with BBN 
(0.01% in water for 4 wk). A sodium saccharin dose-dependent increase in papillary or nodular 
hyperplasia ofthe urinary bladder was statistically significant in females (1% and 5% sodium 
saccharin groups) and males (5% sodium saccharin group) in the BBN-exposed groups 
(Nakanishi et al., 1980a). 
The effects of sequential administration (initiation/promotion protocol) of0.01% BBN in 
drinking water and 5.0% sodium saccharin in feed and co-administration of0.001% BBN in 
drinking water and 5.0% sodium saccharin in feed, were studied in 8-wk-old male Wistar rats by 
Nakanishi et al. (1980b). In the first experiment (sequential administration), rats received BBN 
for 4 wk and then sodium saccharin for an additional32 wk. In the second experiment (co­
administration), rats were fed BBN and sodium saccharin for 40 wk. When rats were 
administered BBN and sodium saccharin concurrently, there was an increased incidence of 
urinary bladder papilloma (10/24 vs. 0/12 in controls). Sequential administration produced a non­
statistically significant increase (9/31 vs. 0/12 in controls) in the incidence ofbladder papilloma. 
In addition, there was one transitional cell carcinoma among the 31 rats that received saccharin 
sequentially and two transitional cell carcinomas among the 24 rats receiving saccharin 
concurrently with BBN. Transitional cell hyperplasia was noted in rats receiving sodium 
saccharin alone as well as in groups receiving BBN before and during saccharin administration. 
Nakanishi et al. (1982) reported that there was no statistically significant increase in the 
incidence ofhepatocellular carcinoma or urinary bladder papilloma in male F344 rats (age not 
specified) initiated with 0.01% BBN in drinking water for 4 wk and then fed 5% sodium 
saccharin in the diet for an additional 32 wk, as compared to rats administered BBN alone. 
Sodium saccharin significantly enhanced urothelial hyperplasia after BBN pretreatment and 
produced a non-statistically significant increase in urinary bladder papillomas (6/29 vs. 0/29 in 
controls). 
The comparative tumor-promoting effects of 5% sodium saccharin, 5% sodium L­
ascorbate, 5% L-ascorbic acid, 5% sodium saccharin plus sodium L-ascorbate, or 5% sodium 
saccharin plus L-ascorbic acid were studied in 6-wk-old male F344 rats. Rats were initiated with 
0.05% BBN in drinking water for 4 wk and were then fed the test diets for an additional32 wk. 
The authors found that bladder-cancer promotion by sodium saccharin was inhibited by L­
48 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
ascorbic acid and enhanced by sodium L-ascorbate, apparently as a function ofurinary pH. 
Sodium saccharin alone, sodium L-ascorbate alone, and these two compounds in combination 
caused increased incidences ofurothelial hyperplasia, papilloma, and carcinoma in the urinary 
bladder (Fukushima et al., 1990). 
Yu et al. (1992) studied the tumor-promoting effects of sodium saccharin alone and in 
combination with nordihydroguaiaretic acid (an antioxidant and inhibitor of arachidonic acid 
metabolism) in BBN-initiated male F344 rats. BBN (0.05%) was administered to 6-wk-old rats 
in the drinking water for 4 wk. The rats were then fed 5% sodium saccharin with or without the 
antioxidant for an additional36 wk. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid was coadministered at a 
concentration of 0.1% in the diet. The authors found that sodium saccharin promoted BBN 
tumorigenicity, while nordihydroguaiaretic acid plus sodium saccharin decreased the incidences of 
papilloma. Both groups receiving sodium saccharin had urothelial hyperplasia. 
4.2.3 2-Acetylaminofluorene (AAF) 
Nakanishi et al. (1982) reported that there was no significant increase in the incidence of 
hepatocellular carcinoma or urinary bladder carcinoma in male F344 rats (age not specified) 
initiated with 0.02% AAF in the diet for 4 wk and then fed 5% sodium saccharin in the diet for 
an additional 32 wk, as compared to rats administered AAF alone. There was a statistically 
significant increase in urothelial hyperplasia in the sodium saccharin-promoted rats. 
The effect oflifetime sodium saccharin dosing (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, or 5.0% diet for 117 wk), 
administered 2 wk after initiation with AAF (200 ppm diet for 13 weeks), on female weanling 
BALB/c mice was studied by Frederick et al. (1989). No dose-related increase in tumor incidence 
was found in initiated mice exposed to 0.1-5% sodium saccharin diet. 
In female Horton SD rats (age not specified) co-administered 300 mg AAF/kg diet and 5% 
sodium saccharin in the diet for 40 wk, no animals developed malignant lesions ofthe urinary 
bladder. Eleven ofthe 12 AAF-treated rats (no sodium saccharin in diet) developed palpable 
mammary and ear-duct tumors, while 6/12 animals exposed to AAF and sodium saccharin 
developed these tumors. Liver tumors occurred in control and exposed animals (Ershoff and 
Bajwa, 1974; cited by IARC, 1980). IARC (1980) noted that the small number ofanimals used 
and the fact that food consumption was not measured prevented the evaluation ofAAF and 
sodium saccharin exposure. 
4 .2.4 N-[4-(5- Nitro- 2-furyl)- 2-thiazolyl]formamide (F ANFT) 
The effects of sodium saccharin in F ANFT -initiated (0.2% diet for 6 wk) 4-wk-old male 
F344 rats were studied by Cohen et al. (1979). Subsequent to initiation with FANFT, rats were 
exposed to a 5% sodium saccharin diet (o-toluenesulfonamide free) for up to 83 wk. Two other 
groups received o-toluenesulfonamide-free sodium saccharin either with or without FANFT 
initiation following a 6-wk no-exposure period. The incidence ofbladder cancer was not 
increased in the sodium saccharin-only group (0/20) when compared to the no-exposure control 
group (0/42). In the FANFT-initiated control group, 4/20 rats developed bladder cancer and 1/20 
rats developed bladder papilloma. In the F ANFT plus sodium saccharin groups with or without 
a 6-wk no-exposure period, the incidences ofbladder cancer were 13/18 and 18/19, respectively. 
49 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
Fukushima et al. (1981) fed 5-wk-old male F344 rats 0.2% FANFT diet for only a 4-wk 
initiation period in order to decrease the production ofbladder cancer in the F ANFT -only group. 
Rats were subsequently fed a 5% sodium saccharin or control diet for 100 wk. There was a 
significant increase (p < 0.03) in the incidence ofcarcinoma ofthe bladder as compared to 
F ANFT-only controls (5/26 vs. 0/25). 
Murasaki and Cohen (1983a) evaluated the co-carcinogenicity ofFANFT (0.005% diet) 
and sodium saccharin (5% diet) administered to 5-wk-old male Fischer rats for 2 yr. The authors 
reported that the incidence ofbladder lesions was marginally significant (p < 0.06), when 
compared to the incidence in FANFT-only controls (5116 vs. 0/11). There were no statistically 
significant increases in tumor incidences for other tissues. 
!maida and Wang (1986) studied sodium saccharin as a promoter in a two-stage 
carcinogenesis model. Groups of 42 or 43 male weanling F344 rats were exposed to 5% sodium 
saccharin in AIN-76A diet for 100 wk subsequent to a 4-wk regimen of exposure to either 0.2% 
F ANFT in Wayne diet or 0.005% N,N-dibutylnitrosamine (DBN) in drinking water and control 
Wayne diet. None ofthe control rats fed sodium saccharin alone developed bladder, liver, 
esophageal, or forestomach tumors. There was no statistically significant increase in the 
incidence oftumors of the bladder, liver, or esophagus in rats initiated with F ANFT or DBN, 
with a subsequent dietary administration of sodium saccharin, as compared to F ANFT -only and 
DBN-only controls, respectively. However, the group receiving F ANFT initiation followed by 
sodium saccharin promotion did have an increased incidence ofurinary bladder carcinomas 
(p = 0.059). 
The comparative effects ofdifferent chemical forms of saccharin and ascorbate in 
conjunction with other chemicals that would affect the urinary ionic composition and pH were 
studied by Cohen et al. (1991b). Rats (5-wk-old male F344) were exposed to 0.02% FANFT or 
control diet for 6 wk. Subsequent to administration ofFANFT, rats were exposed to 3 or 5% 
sodium saccharin, 3.12 or 5.2% calcium saccharin, 2.53 or 4.21% acid saccharin, 4.44% ascorbic 
acid, or 5% sodium ascorbate diet for 72 wk. Carcinomas and papillomas developed in 12/39 
(31 %) and 5/39 (13%) rats, respectively, in the FANFT-only group. A statistically significant 
increased incidence oftumorigenesis occurred in all ofthe other groups, with the exception ofacid 
saccharin, ascorbic acid, and low-dose calcium saccharin. Sodium saccharin > sodium ascorbate > 
calcium saccharin for enhancement ofbladder tumorigenesis; none ofthe forms of saccharin were 
tumorigenic without F ANFT initiation. The authors found that an elevated urinary pH increased 
tumorigenicity. However, elevated urinary sodium concentrations are sufficient, as shown by the 
enhancement ofbladder tumor promotion by sodium saccharin and sodium ascorbate, and by the 
enhanced bladder tumorigenicity ofcalcium saccharin when sodium chloride was added to the 
calcium saccharin exposure. Masui et al. (1991) analyzed the tumors in this study for H-ras 
mutations by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody against p21. H-ras mutations were 
found in 2/3 and 3/6 bladder tumors from rats exposed to FANFT alone, and 4/20 and 1110 H-ras 
mutations were found in tumors from rats exposed to F ANFT initiation with 3 or 5% sodium 
saccharin promotion, respectively. 
Okamura et al. (1991) compared the Prolab 3200 with the AIN-76A diet for the 
promoting effects of sodium saccharin and found that male F344 rats on Pro lab 3200 diet 
exhibited sodium saccharin (5% diet for 100 wk) enhancement of bladder tumors when initiated 
50 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
for 4 wk with 0.2% FANFT. This effect was not found in the AIN-76A-fed rats initiated with 
F ANFT and fed 5% sodium saccharin for 100 wk. 
4.2.5 N-Methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) 
A series of reports on studies conducted by Hicks et al. (1973, 1975) and Hicks and 
Chowaniec (1977) evaluated sodium saccharin (2-yr exposure) following intravesicular instillation 
ofMNU (single dose of 1.5 or 2 mg) in 6-to 8-wk-old Wistar rats. In 138 rats in the male and 
female 4 g/kg/day dietary sodium saccharin-only group, 3 bladder tumors were found. 
Administration of 2 glkg/day of sodium saccharin in drinking water for two yr did not produce 
any bladder tumors in male and female Wistar rats. Bladder tumors were found in 23/49 (47%) 
female rats in an MNU plus 2 g/kg/day dietary sodium saccharin group. Bladder tumor incidence 
was increased in the MNU plus 4 glkg/day sodium saccharin female group (27/47; 57%). 
In an effort to reproduce the experiments ofHicks et al. (1973, 1975) and Hicks and 
Chowaniec (1977), Mohr et al. (1978) instilled 2 mg MNU in the bladders offemale Wistar/AF­
Han rats which were subsequently fed 2% sodium saccharin for the first 10 wk and 4% 
afterwards [up to 2 yr] (specific dosing regimen not specified). In the MNU-only group, bladder 
tumors were found in 19/49 (39%) rats; and ureter tumors were found in 8/49 (17%) rats, while 
14/49 (28%) rats developed renal pelvis tumors. In the MNU plus sodium saccharin group, 
incidences of renal pelvis, ureter, and bladder tumors were 43, 11, and 39%, respectively. The 
high incidence oftumors in the MNU -only group was explained by the original authors as a 
result of the use of MNU within 15 min of dissolution and the assumption that in their 
experiment the dose of MNU was not subcarcinogenic. 
Hooson et al. (1980) studied the contribution ofthe sodium saccharin contaminant o­
toluenesulfonamide in the promotion ofMNU-initiated bladder carcinogenesis in female Wistar 
rats (age not specified). No statistically significant differences were found in bladder tumor 
incidence with administration ofa single 0.15 mL-dose ofMNU, followed 2 wk later by daily 
administration in drinking water or diet of either 2 glkg o-toluenesulfonamide-free sodium 
saccharin or 2 glkg sodium saccharin containing 40 mglkg o-toluenesulfonamide for 2 yr, as 
compared to a control group given MNU alone. There was, however, a decrease in the latency 
period in the MNU+sodium saccharin treated groups (55 and 52 wk vs. 87 wk for MNU-only 
controls). 
West et al. (1986) exposed 8-wk-old female Sprague-Dawley rats, which had previously 
been dosed with a single dose of MNU or by saline transurethral instillation into the bladder, to 
0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, or 5% sodium saccharin in the diet. Other groups received MNU followed by 
2% sodium saccharin in water or 5% acid saccharin diet. Sodium saccharin dosing was initiated 2 
days after rats were dosed with MNU and continued until the termination at 102 wk. In MNU­
exposed rats, histopathological examination revealed papillomas and carcinomas ofthe urinary 
bladder. A mortality-adjusted increase in tumor incidence and a decrease in time-to-tumor with 
increasing sodium saccharin dose for the 0-2.5% doses in dead and moribund rats was reported. 
A statistically significant increase in bladder tumor prevalence (p < 0.0012) was found for the 
group of rats exposed to 2.5% sodium saccharin plus MNU vs. the MNU-only control group. 
The greatest number of tumors developed in rats that received four doses ofMNU alone 
throughout the experiment. Rats not exposed to MNU that were dosed with a 0.1-5% sodium 
51 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
saccharin or 5% acid saccharin diet or 2% sodium saccharin in the drinking water developed a 
small number oftumors that were not significantly different from controls. 
In the bladders offemale Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to 1.0, 2.5, or 5.0% dietary 
sodium saccharin (given 4 wk immediately preceding, following, or centered on the day ofbladder 
instillation of0.5mg MNU), MNU-induced tumorigenesis was not enhanced (West et al., 1994). 
After the 4-wk administration ofdietary sodium saccharin, rats were maintained on control diet. 
Additional groups ofrats were dosed neonatally in the milk by administration of the same three 
levels ofdietary saccharin to the dams during three wk oflactation. These latter groups then 
received MNU by bladder instillation at 8 wk of age and remained on the control diet for up to 
106 wk ofage. This neonatal exposure to saccharin did not enhance MNU-induced bladder 
tumors. 
4.2.6 Freeze Ulceration 
Five-wk-old male F344 rats had their bladder cells initiated with application of a steel rod 
frozen in dry ice and acetone (freeze ulceration). Rats were subsequently fed a control diet for 
two wk and then a sodium saccharin diet for 102 wk. This treatment resulted in 5/20 (25%) 
carcinomas and 1/20 (5%) papillomas compared with none when rats were exposed to either 
dosage regimen (freeze ulceration or sodium saccharin diet) alone. When 0.2% FANFT was 
administered in the diet for 2 wk after freeze ulceration followed by 5% sodium saccharin diet for 
1 02 wk, 4/23 ( 17%) ofthe bladders had tumors. Reversing the order ofFANFT and freeze 
ulceration exposure resulted in an 8/22 (36%) incidence ofbladder tumors. Tumors were not 
found in rats that had received F ANFT or sodium saccharin alone (Cohen et al., 1982). 
Hasegawa et al. (1985) fed 5-wk-old male F344 rats 5% sodium saccharin diet either 
immediately or 2, 4, 6, or 18 wk following freeze ulceration ofthe bladder. There was a 
significant increase in the incidence oftransitional cell carcinoma ofthe bladder in all ofthese 
groups as compared to a freeze ulceration-only control group, except in the group fed sodium 
saccharin 2 wk after freeze ulceration (11/36, 6/36, 12/40, 7/36, 9/39 vs. 1139 in controls). No 
bladder carcinoma was detected in control rats administered saccharin alone.

5.0 GENOTOXICITY 
Extensive reviews ofthe genotoxicity of saccharin have been conducted by Ashby (1985), 
!ARC (1980, pp. 148-150, see Appendix A; 1982, see Appendix B; 1987b, see Appendix C), 
and, most recently, by Whysner and Williams (1996). The studies summarized below are largely 
based on these reviews; additional, relevant studies are presented in Table 5-1, while the Genetic 
Activity Profiles published by IARC (1987a) for saccharin are provided in Figures 5-1 and 5-2. 
Most ofthe numerous in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies on sodium saccharin have 
been negative with occasional inconsistent or conflicting results and false positive results 
attributed to factors such as mutagenic impurities, inhibition ofDNA synthesis, and osmotic 
effects. 
5.1 Noneukaryotic Systems 
5.1.1 Gene Mutations 
Both sodium saccharin and saccharin (form unspecified) have been reported as negative in 
15 studies for the induction ofreverse mutations in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA92, 
TA94, TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and TA1538 (not all strains were tested in all studies), 
with and without S9 activation, and using either the plate incorporation or pre-incubation forms 
of the assay. 
In a study that evaluated the induction ofreverse mutations in S. typhimurium by 4 
commercially available saccharin samples and by 1 highly purified saccharin sample in the 
presence and absence ofS9, the commercially produced samples were positive for mutation 
induction, whereas the highly purified sample was negative (Batzinger et al., 1977). The author 
concluded that commercial saccharin samples contain mutagenic impurities. 
5.1.2 DNA Damage 
Saccharin (form unspecified) was reported as negative for the induction ofprophage 
(Rossman et al., 1991) and DNA damage/SOS repair in Escherichia coli (DeFlora et al., 1984). 
5.1.3 DNA Synthesis 
Saccharin did not alter DNA synthesis, as measured by the incorporation of 
[3H]thymidine, in S. typhimurium (Beljanski et al., 1982). 
5.2 Lower Eukaryotic Systems 
5.2.1 Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
Sodium saccharin without metabolic activation was reported to be positive in the yeast, 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for the induction ofaneuploidy, gene conversion, and reverse 
mutations. However, in two other yeast studies (including one conducted using a 9-fold higher 
dose), saccharin (form unspecified) was negative for gene conversion and mutation induction but 
positive again for the induction ofaneuploidy. 
5.2.2 Drosophila melanogaster 
Sodium saccharin was initially found in a 1971 study to be positive for the induction of 
sex-linked recessive mutants and negative for heritable translocations in Drosophila 
60 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
melanogaster. However, two subsequent studies conducted using equal or higher doses reported 
weak positive or negative results for the induction of sex-linked recessive mutations. 
5.2.3 Higher Plants 
Ma et al. (1995) concluded that saccharin induced micronuclei in the root-tips ofAllium 
cepa (onions) and Viciafava (beans) following a 6-hour exposure at 120 mM. 
5.3 Mammalian Systems In Vitro 
5.3.1 Gene Mutations 
In two studies, sodium saccharin was reported to be weakly mutagenic in mouse 
lymphoma LSI 78Y cells at very high doses (>1 0 mg/mL) and only in the presence ofmetabolic 
activation. A third study using doses as high as 20 mg/mL up was negative. Sodium saccharin, at 
doses above 1 0 mg/mL, was also reported to induce a highly significant increase in the number of 
ouabain-resistant mutants in human RSa embryo cells (Suzuki and Suzuki, 1988), and to increase 
the number ofmutations at the k-ras gene, codon 12 in SW480 human colon adenocarcinoma cells 
(Suzuki and Suzuki, 1993). However, based on either the weakness ofthe response and/or the 
magnitude ofthe doses required to elicit a positive response, these data would be considered to 
be ofquestionable value using current testing practices. 
5.3.2 DNA Damage 
Sodium saccharin (without metabolic activation) was weakly positive or positive for the 
induction ofsister chromatid exchanges (SCE) in three studies using Chinese hamster cells and in 
two studies using human lymphocytes. Sodium saccharin and saccharin, in the absence of 
metabolic activation, were reported to be negative for SCE induction in one study using mouse 
embryo fibroblasts and in two studies using human lymphocytes. Studies with metabolic 
activation were either not conducted or were negative for SCE induction. In the positive studies, 
the doses capable ofinducing a significant increase in SCE ranged from 1 to 12 mg/mL and the 
maximum increase in SCE was generally less than two-fold. As discussed by Ashby (1985) and 
based on our current appreciation ofthe various processes involved in SCE induction, this 
increase in SCE more likely reflects the ability of saccharin at high doses to inhibit DNA 
synthesis rather than an ability to cause DNA damage. 
5.3.3 Inhibition of DNA Repair 
Skare and Wong (1985) reported that sodium saccharin did not inhibit the repair ofUV­
induced DNA damage in WI-38 human fetal lung fibroblasts. 
5.3.4 DNA Synthesis 
Yanagisawa et al. (1987) and Heiland Reifferscheid (1992) both concluded that sodium 
saccharin at relatively high doses inhibited the rate of DNA synthesis, as measured by 
incorporation of eH]thymidine after treatment, in human B-32 fibroblasts or HeLa S3 cells. 
61 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
5..3.5 Chromosomal Damage 
Sodium saccharin was found to be positive without S9 activation in ten studies and 
negative in two studies for the induction ofchromosome aberrations using Chinese hamster cells 
and human lymphocytes. Ashby (1985) and Whysner and Williams (1996) concluded that the 
high dose level~ used (up to 48 mg/mL) may have caused osmotic changes leading to false 
positive results. 
5.3.6 Cell Transformation 
Saccharin (form unspecified) was found to give negative results for cell transformation in 
BALB/c3T3 and C3H 10T1/2 mouse and RLV Fischer rat embryo cells. Sakai and Sato (1989) 
also reported that sodium saccharin did not increase the number oftransformed foci in 
BALB/3T3 cells with or without a 2-week promotion period with TPA. 
5.4 Mammalian Systems In Vivo 
5.4.1 Gene Mutations and Dominant Lethal Mutations 
In a study that compared the mutagenic activities of3 commercially available saccharin 
samples with a highly purified saccharin sample, Batzinger et al. (1977) administered 2.5 g 
saccharin/kg to mice (strain not specified) and collected 24-hour urine samples. The urine 
samples were then assayed for mutagenicity in S. typhimurium strains T A98 and T A 100 in the 
presence and absence of S9 and the enzyme ~-glucuronidase. In strain TA98, all commercial 
samples were positive for the induction of reverse mutations, but the purified sample was 
negative. In strain TA100, all samples were positive. Mutagenic activities ofthe urine was 
enhanced in TA98 by ~-glucuronidase. In TA100, mutagens were inactivated by 89; in TA98, 
mutagens were activated by 89. The authors proposed that 2 mutagenic substances were 
present. A similar study using TA 98, TA 100 and TA 1537 performed on urine obtained from 
rats treated with 5% dietary sodium saccharin, Hasegawa et al. (1984) failed to show mutagenic 
activity after 0, 1, 5, or 14 days oftreatment. 
Batzinger et al. (1977) also conducted a host-mediated assay for the induction ofreverse 
mutations by the 4 saccharin samples (3 commercially available, 1 highly purified). S. 
typhimurium strain TA98 or TA100 was incubated for 6 hours in the peritoneal cavity ofmice 
administered 2.5 g saccharin/kg. The highly purified sample was negative for mutation induction 
in both bacterial strains. All ofthe commercially available samples were positive, except for one 
sample that was negative when incubated with strain TA98. 
Both negative and positive results were obtained for sodium saccharin in the mouse spot 
test, examining somatic cell mutations induced in pup coat color. In his review ofthe literature, 
Ashby (1985) reported that the difference may have been due to the different routes of exposure 
(i.p. vs. orally, respectively) and the 7.5-fold higher oral dose levels in the positive study. 
As compiled by Ashby (1985), IARC (1987a,b) and Whysner and Williams (1996) and 
discussed by Adler and Ashby (1989), saccharin has given conflicting results in the mouse 
dominant lethal mutation assay, with three positive and three negative studies for sodium 
saccharin. The strain ofmice and the route of exposure were often the same and the doses often 
62 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
overlapped for both negative and positive studies. The authors ofthe review articles concluded 
that the in vivo mutagenic ability of saccharin has not been adequately demonstrated. 
5.4.2 DNA Damage 
Sodium saccharin, when administered orally at doses between 5 and 10 glkg, was reported 
to induce up to a two-fold increase in SCE in Chinese hamster bone marrow cells (Renner, 1979). 
Dropkin et al. (1985) reported that sodium saccharin at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day did not cause 
sister chromatid exchanges in the fetal pups of female ICR albino mice dosed on the lOth day of 
gestation and sacrificed on the 17th day. 
5.4.3 Chromosomal Aberrations 
In the reviews conducted by Ashby (1985), IARC (1987a,b), and Whysner and Williams 
(1996), both sodium saccharin and saccharin (form unspecified) were reported as negative for the 
induction ofchromosomal damage in somatic and germ cells ofrodents in seven studies and 
positive in somatic and germ cells in one study each. Dropkin et al. (1985) also reported that 
sodium saccharin at doses up to 2000 mg/kg did not cause chromosome aberrations in the fetal 
pups offemale I CR albino mice dosed on the 1Oth day of gestation and sacrificed on the 17th 
day. 
5.4.4 Induction ofMicronuclei 
Sodium saccharin was reported in two studies as negative for micronucleus induction in 
mouse bone marrow cells.

A schematic view of a Genetic Activity Profile (GAP) representing four studies (two positive and 
two negative) for an example short-term test, ECW. Either the lowest effective dose (LED) or 
highest ineffective dose (HID) is recorded from each study, and a simple mathematical 
transformation (as illustrated above) is used to convert LED or HID values into the logarithmic 
dose unit (LDU) values plotted in a GAP. For each test the average of the LDUs of the majority 
call is plotted using a solid vertical bar drawn from the origin. A dashed vertical bar indicates 
studies that conflict with the majority call for the test. Note in cases where there are an equal 
number of positive and negative studies, as shown here, the overall call is determined positive.

6.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA 
Summary: Saccharin is a polar synthetic compound that is not a substrate for normal 
intermediary metabolism and is not used as an energy source. Earlier metabolic investigations 
using radiolabeled techniques indicated that saccharin underwent limited metabolism by ring 
opening to 2-sulfamoylbenzoic and 2-sulfabenzoic acids. However, these findings were not 
confirmed in later more extensive studies conducted on humans and rats using similar radiolabeled 
techniques. In humans, saccharin is almost completely (90%) absorbed from the intestinal tract 
and excreted unchanged in the urine largely (90%) by renal tubular secretion within 24 hours after 
oral administration. Human data fitted a two compartment model (plasma and renal clearance, 
half-life [t112] about 70 minutes) for intravenous (i.v.) administration ofa bolus dose of sodium 
saccharin dihydrate (NaSac•2H 20). 
After rats were i.v. dosed with [5-3H]saccharin, the plasma concentration-time curve 
clearly showed a biphasic decline during the first 2 hours, and about 90% ofthe dose was 
recovered in urine which was found to be consistent with the elimination t112 (30 minutes). At 
low doses (100 mglkg or less) the plasma clearance (about 10 mL min-1 kg-1) decreased at high 
doses (1000 mg/kg) to 5.5 mL min-1 kg-1, with the recovery in urine in 2 hours decreasing to 65% 
ofthe dose. The elimination t112 (30 minutes) was found to be similar for all doses less than 1000 
mgtkg. 
With occasional exceptions, studies in male and female rats dosed with 5% or greater 
levels of sodium saccharin in the diet typically show alterations in the ultrastructural. morphology 
ofurinary bladder urothelium, enhanced proliferation as evidenced by elevated labeling indexes 
(Lis), and morphological evidence ofurothelial hyperplasia. These effects can be seen as soon as 
90 days after commencement of in utero treatment and generally within 10 wk when treatment 
starts shortly after weaning, especially when treatment is preceded or accompanied by treatment 
with a urinary bladder initiator. It has been shown that the severity ofurothelial changes is 
influenced by diet. Urinary bladder changes have been demonstrated in male and female rats but 
not in other species tested. 
6.1 Absorption, Distribution, and Excretion 
Sweatman et al. (1981) dosed three adult human males ages 25 to 37 years with saccharin 
either orally (2 gin gelatin capsules after an overnight fast or 1 to 2 hours after breaking fast) or 
i.v. (sodium saccharin dihydrate, 1 0 mglkg) and recorded the excretion of saccharin over 96 hours. 
The results indicated that saccharin was almost completely (90%) absorbed from the intestinal 
tract after oral administration and excreted unchanged in the urine largely by renal tubular 
excretion, mostly within the first 24 hours of dosing. This study also found that saccharin 
administered either orally or intravenously resulted in 90% recovery ofthe dose in the urine and 
up to 8% in the feces. 
In studies it was found that saccharin does not accumulate in any tissues, including the 
bladder (Renwick, 1986). Sweatman and Renwick (1980) studied eighteen adult male and six 
adult female rats fed ad libitum a diet containing 1 to 10%, and 5%, respectively, sodium 
saccharin dihydrate for 22 days. High-pressure liquid chromatography was used to detect the 
concentration of saccharin in tissues (well perfused; poorly perfused) and plasma. Saccharin 
70 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
underwent significant plasma protein binding ( 69 to 86%) at all dietary levels. The well perfused 
tissues (adrenal, liver, lung, and spleen) contained 20 to 50% lower concentrations ofsaccharin 
than the corresponding plasma concentrations at each dietary level. The lowest levels of 
saccharin detected (10 to 20% plasma level) were found in poorly perfused tissues (muscle and 
fat). The highest concentrations were found in the gut wall. A tissue-to-plasma ratio greater than 
unity was observed in the kidneys (101.6 )lg/mL: 29.6 )lg/mL [3.43]) and urinary bladder (120.7 
Jlg/mL: 29.6 )lg/mL [4.1]). Although the tissue distribution was similar between male and female 
rats fed a diet containing 5% saccharin, the tissue concentrations of saccharin were higher in 
females than those found in males (liver, 2.4-fold; lung, 3-fold; muscle, 2.6-fold; kidney, 1.5-fold; 
bladder, 6.7-fold). 
Sweatman and Renwick (1982) studied whether or not a two-generation feeding protocol 
was associated with uniquely elevated concentrations of saccharin in the bladder or other tissues 
ofrats. Following a single oral dose of [3H]saccharin (sodium saccharin dihydrate; 50 mglkg; 1.0 
to 3.0 mCi; >99.8% pure) to female Sprague-Dawley rats in late pregnancy, concentrations of3H 
in tissues of dams at 6 to 12 hr after administration ofthe dose were higher than those ofthe 
fetuses. At 6 hr, maternal liver, kidney, and bladder wall concentrations were ~5-fold, ~33.3-fold 
and~ 16.7-fold, respectively, higher than those ofthe fetuses. At 12 hr, maternal liver, kidney, 
and bladder wall concentrations were~ 1.4-fold, ~8.3-fold, and ~5.8-fold, respectively, higher than 
those of fetuses. The concentrations of3H in fetal tissues decreased more slowly at 48 hr, 
exceeding the corresponding values obtained for maternal tissues: liver, 3.2-fold; kidney, 0.8-fold, 
and bladder wall, 5.4-fold. The authors suggested that these findings point to the possible 
accumulation ofsaccharin during chronic intake (Sweatman and Renwick, 1982). 
In another experiment conducted by Sweatman and Renwick (1982), dams were fed a 5% 
saccharin diet ad libitum from 4 wk prior to mating until killed during late gestation. The 
observed liver and kidney concentrations were lower in the fetuses than the corresponding 
maternal values: liver, 80 Jlg/g maternal vs. 36.5 Jlg/g fetal; kidney, 382 Jlg/g maternal vs. 198 Jlg/g 
fetal. However, the average concentration of saccharin in fetal bladder tissue was approximately 
3.8-fold higher than the corresponding maternal value. The saccharin levels in the bladder, but no 
other tissue, offemales (189 ± 149 )lg/g) were significantly lower than in males (292 ± 261 Jlg/g) 
(p < 0.05 by unpaired Student's t-test). Between days 17 and 20, the concentration of saccharin 
in the amniotic fluid increased (males [n = 5], 15 Jlg/g; females [n = 7], 20 Jlg/g to males [n = 12] 
361 Jlg/g; females [n = 18] 276 Jlg/g), which is a similar finding to Ballet al. (1977) who stated 
that the increase was possibly due to elimination of saccharin in fetal urine. 
Liver concentrations of saccharin in F I animals exposed to a 5% saccharin diet reached a 
maximum of approximately 50 Jlg/g soon after weaning (between days 28 and 45). Due to the 
variability in the levels of saccharin in the bladder, no distinct maximum concentration was 
observed in F I animals. In previous studies conducted by Matthews et al. (1973), Lethco and 
Wallace (1975), Ballet al. (1977), and Sweatman and Renwick (1980), variability in the 
concentration ofsaccharin in the bladder wall was reported, either after a single dose or after 
chronic administration. Statistical analysis ofthe total bladder wall data showed that female 
levels were significantly (50%; p < 0.05) lower than males when each individual result was 
expressed as a percentage ofthe mean for the animals killed at that time point (to eliminate 
temporal variation). Between days 18 and 23, which corresponds to the time of separation from 
71 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
the mother and consumption ofa 5% saccharin diet, the average concentration of saccharin in 
urine ofF 1 animals showed a marked increase (males, [n = 5] 4.6 J.Lg/mL vs. [n = 2] 17.9 J.Lg/mL; 
females, [n = 2] 8.6 J.Lg/mL vs. [n = 5] 11.1 J.Lg/mL)(Sweatman and Renwick, 1982). 
Sweatman and Renwick ( 1982) studied the distribution and turnover of [3H]saccharin in 
pregnant rats maintained on a 5% saccharin diet prior to mating and transferred to a 5% saccharin 
diet radiolabeled with [3H] (6.1 J.LCi/g) on the 1Oth day of gestation. On days 10 to 20 of 
gestation, the concentrations of [3H]saccharin in maternal and fetal livers were similar to the 
unlabeled concentrations found by HPLC on day 20 (see above), indicating that steady-state 
concentrations had been reached. In the fetal tissues, the levels of [3H]saccharin showed a 
relatively uniform distribution. However, markedly lower concentrations were found in the 
brain. Similar findings were reported by Ballet al. (1977). The concentrations of [3H]saccharin 
were below the limit ofdetection in the fetal bladder. Sweatman and Renwick (1982) suggested 
that this was due to the size of the fetal bladder and the relatively low specific activity ofthe 
[3H]saccharin diet given. There was a marked reduction in the 3H concentrations in most 
maternal and fetal tissues upon transferring back to an unlabeled 5% saccharin diet for 24 hr or 48 
hr prior to killing. Tritium concentrations in fetal liver, kidney, and muscle decreased to an 
average of29, 45, and 22%, respectively, ofthe steady-state level after 24 hr on the unlabeled 
saccharin diet, while the corresponding maternal tissues decreased to 19, 51, and 23%, 
respectively. Tritium concentrations were not detectable(< 200 J.Lg/g) in the fetal bladder wall 
throughout the duration of [3H]saccharin diet (10-20 days). 
Ball et al. (1977) studied three groups ofrats, one on a normal diet without pretreatment 
with [14C]sodium saccharin for up to 12 months, and the others pre-treated with 1% or 5% 
saccharin diet for up to 12 months. Individual rats in each group were subsequently administered 
an oral dose of 16 to 22 mg/kg (5 to 9 J.LCi) sodium saccharin. In both groups about 95% ofthe 
dose was eliminated within 24 hours, with 72 to 92% detected in the urine and 0 to 22% detected 
in the feces. Within 3 days ofdosing, excretion of 14C was essentially complete. The final 
recovery in 6 days averaged 1 00%, with the urine containing 77 to 97% and feces containing 6 to 
22% ofthe labeled dose. Pre-treatment ofrats with a diet containing 1% and 5% saccharin for up 
to 12 months did not alter the pattern ofabsorption and excretion. The only alteration ofthis 
pattern was increased concentrations of [14C]saccharin in the feces after continued intake, 
especially at the 1% dietary level. The authors also investigated the excretion of [14C]saccharin in 
urine after i.p. injection and very little was associated with the gastrointestinal tract. The authors 
concluded that the increased concentration of [14C]sacch~n in feces after oral administration 
arose from incomplete absorption in the gut. 
Lethco and Wallace (1975) administered [3_14C]saccharin (5, 50, and 500 mg/kg) to male 
and female rats. The distribution of radioactivity in organs and tissues at various time intervals 
was monitored. One hour after administration of a 50 mg/kg dose, traces of 14C were found in 
almost all ofthe organs. Saccharin reached a peak blood concentration within 8 hours. The 
kidney, urinary bladder, and liver tissues contained the highest 14C concentration. All ofthe 
tissues except brain and spleen contained traces of 14C 72 hours after dosing. The rats excreted 
66 to 84 % ofthe labeled dose of [3-14C]saccharin in the urine and 10 to 40% in the feces. This 
study also compared the metabolic profiles of a dog, rabbit, guinea pig, and hamster. When 
72 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
compared, the metabolic profiles indicated that there was very little difference in the pattern due 
to dose level or animal species. 
The absorption, distribution, and excretion of radiolabeled saccharin was studied by 
Matthews et al. (1973). Male rats (seven groups ofthree or more) were studied after receiving a 
single oral dose of [14C]saccharin (1 mg/kg in 0.5 cm3 distilled water). The dose was administered 
orally to animals that had been fed ad libitum or fasted overnight. Saccharin entered the 
bloodstream rapidly, most likely due to absorption through the stomach, with peak 
concentrations in the blood between 7.5 and 15 minutes after administration. Saccharin was 
absorbed by the fasted animals more rapidly than those that were fed. The saccharin 
concentration offasted animals was approximately twice that found in animals fed ad libitum. 
The time to peak saccharin concentration and the general shape of the curve were similar in the 
kidney and blood. The authors found that glomerular filtration of saccharin from the blood and 
its excretion in the urine resulted in temporary accumulation of 5 times more saccharin in the 
kidneys than in other organs or tissues. Saccharin was detected in the urine taken from the 
bladders of every rat as soon as 3 minutes post saccharin administration. 
The accumulation and clearance of multiple doses of saccharin was also investigated by 
Matthews et al. (1973). Saccharin (1 mg/kg/day) was administered to two groups offour rats 
each for 7 days. Saccharin concentrations in the major organs were measured 24 and 72 hours 
after administering the final dose. At 24 hours, the saccharin concentration was slightly higher in 
the gastrointestinal tract and considerably higher in the bladder than in any other tissues. The 
authors suggested that although elevated concentrations of saccharin were not present in these 
tissues, the tissues may have absorbed saccharin from their contents rather than by distribution 
of the blood. Most ofthe saccharin had been cleared from all ofthe tissues by 72 hours after the 
last dose, with none ofthe tissues having a significantly higher concentration than the others at 
that time. The authors also stated that the ratio ofsaccharin excreted in the urine and feces was 
approximately 9:1 when analyzed during the feeding period and after the last dose ·of saccharin 
had been administered. 
The authors continued this study by treating rats 5 times with a dose of 1 mg/kg at 90­
minute intervals for a total dose of 5 mglkg within a 6-hour period. This dosing regimen was used 
to simulate the daily dose of saccharin humans would be expected to consume be using saccharin 
in food or beverages several times throughout the day. The rats receiving multiple doses of 
saccharin were reported to have a higher saccharin concentration in tissues than in the 
corresponding tissues ofrats which had received single doses of saccharin (1 mg/kg). Rats that 
were sacrificed 90 minutes after the fifth (last) 1 mg/kg dose were found to have a saccharin 
concentration in the kidneys equal to or greater than 5 times the concentration of kidneys from 
rats which received only a single dose of 1 mglkg. Thereafter, the saccharin concentration in the 
kidneys of all of these rats approached 9 to 10 times that of the animals which received only a 
single dose. Twenty-four hours later, the difference had decreased to approximately 2-fold. A 
10-fold difference was observed after 24 hours between concentrations in the bladders of rats 
receiving multiple doses and those ofrats receiving single doses. Still, at 24 hours, the 
concentration in the bladders of rats which received 5 doses was less than 10% of that observed 
90 minutes after the last of the 5 doses (Matthews et al., 1973). These data showed that 
73 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
significant concentrations ofsaccharin can occur in certain tissues such as the kidney and bladder 
that appear to be almost completely cleared by the following day. 
6.2 Metabolism 
Saccharin is a polar synthetic compound that is not a substrate for normal intermediary 
metabolism and is not used as an energy source (Renwick, 1986). Metabolic investigations using 
radiolabeling techniques have indicated that saccharin undergoes limited metabolism by ring 
opening to 2-sulfamoylbenzoic and 2-sulfobenzoic acids (Pitkin et al., 1971; Kennedy et al., 
1972; Arnold, 1983; Renwick, 1986). Kennedy et al. (1972) fed e4C]saccharin to two rats (1 
male and 1 female). Components ofsolvent extracts from their acidified urine were separated by 
thin layer chromatography (TLC) and compared to the authentic 2-sulfamoylbenzoic and 
sulfobenzoic acids. This experiment showed that in the urine samples collected between 0 to 24 
hours after dosing, 0.4% to 0.6% ofthe dose was excreted as 2-sulfamoylbenzoic acid and less 
than 0.1% to 0.6% ofthe dose as 2-sulfobenzoic acid. 
Pitkin et al. (1971) studied the metabolism of [14C]saccharin in eight female Rhesus 
monkeys using the same method as Kennedy et al. (1972), which was unpublished at the time. 
The authors reported that [14C]saccharin was excreted essentially unchanged in the urine of 
monkeys. The authors also found that urine samples collected and analyzed between 24 to 48 
hours and 48 to 72 hours after dosing contained 1.2% ofthe dose as 2-sulfamoylbenzoic acid and 
0.1% as 2-sulfobenzoic acid. 
The Food and Drug Administration also detected 2-sulfamoylbenzoic in a more extensive 
study that focused on the metabolic profiles of a dog, guinea pig, hamster, rabbit, and six rats 
exposed to [3_14C]saccharin via gavage (Lethco and Wallace, 1975). In this study six rats (three 
males and three females) were given oral doses of5, 50, and 500 mglkg [3)4C]saccharin (10 to 15 
J..LCilkg). Twenty-four hours after the dose was administered, the rate of 14C0 2 expiration, and 
[14C]carbonate and 2-sulfamoylbenzoic acid excreted via the urine were identified using paper 
chromatography, TLC, UV spectrophotometry, and reverse isotope dilution techniques. These 
data showed that both male and female rats expired 14C0 2 between 0.5 and 8 hours after dosing, 
while only female rats expired 0.01% ofthe dose at 24 hours. Male rats expired a total of0.29, 
0.03, and 0.10% of5, 50, and 500 mglkg doses, respectively, and female rats expired a total of 
0.23, 0.55, and 0.27% ofthe 5, 50, and 500 mglkg, doses, respectively, 24 hours post-dose. 
When 24 rats (12 males and 12 females; 4 rats/dose) were dosed with 5, 50, and 500 mg/kg [3­
14C]saccharin, about 0.4% ofthe dose was excreted as 2-sulfamoylbenzoic acid in the urine with 
approximately equal amounts identified as 14C carbonate as detected by DEAE cellulose 
chromatography (Lethco and Wallace, 1975; Renwick, 1986). Generally, more than 99% ofthe 
urinary radioactivity was unmetabolized saccharin and all ofthe species' urine samples contained 
small amounts of2-sulfamoylbenzoic acid. Comparative metabolic profiles ofa dog, rabbit, 
guinea pig, and hamster indicated that there was little difference in the pattern due to animal 
species or dose level (Lethco and Wallace, 1975). The authors suggested that the breakdown of 
saccharin was due to a chemical reaction as opposed to enzymatic reactions. 
Ballet al. (1977) used chromatographic, reverse isotope dilution techniques, and UV 
spectrophotometric techniques for the detection ofradio labeled metabolites of saccharin (2­
sulfamoylbenzoic acid and 14CO{ in the urine, 14C02 in expired air). The limits ofdetection 
74 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
were as low as 0.03% for 14C0 2 and 14Col-. Rats were fed a diet containing 1% or 5% of 
saccharin for up to 12 months prior to receiving a [14C]saccharin dose (20 mg/kg) administered 
orally. The authors were unable to detect any metabolism in either the urine or in the expired air 
ofthe rats dosed with radiolabeled saccharin. Ballet al. (1977) were also unable to detect any 
metabolites ofsaccharin in the urine ofthree adult humans (one female, two males; 55 to 94 kg 
body weight) who ingested 1 g saccharin/day for 22 days as a treatment prior to receiving a fmal 
dose of [3)4C]-saccharin (20 J.!Ci; 13 mg) on the 22nd day. The authors were also unable to 
detect metabolite production from the three adult humans when they were not subjected to the 
saccharin pretreatment before a dose of [3-14C]saccharin (20 J.!Ci/13 mg). 
Sweatman and Renwick (1979) exposed male rats to saccharin both in utero and during 
lactation. The authors were unable to detect any metabolites of saccharin in the excreta ofrats 
. under these conditions. The authors also reported that after 3-methylcholanthrene treatment 
(inducer ofmetabolism), saccharin metabolites were undetectable using reverse isotope dilution 
with limits ofdetection as low as 0.01% for 2-sulfamoylbenzoic acid. These results found that 
significant metabolism is not induced by long term administration ofsaccharin during the neonatal 
and weaning-stages oftwo generations. 
Clearly, a discrepancy between some ofthe earlier reports and later investigations exist. 
Earlier studies may have used saccharin with slight impurities resulting in metabolism ofthe 
impure substance. Pitkin et al. (1971) used benzene ring-labeled [14C]saccharin from 
Mallinckrodt Chemical Corp. Byard and Golberg (1973) reported that the benzene ring-labeled 
[ 14C]saccharin supplied by Mallinckrodt Chemical Works (St. Louis, MO, USA) contained an 
impurity which produced a 2 to 3% metabolic reaction if given to animals. In brief, the authors 
found that the metabolite produced in vivo from the impurity chromatographed as 2­
sulfamoylbenzoic acid but did not recrystallize with added 2-sulfamoylbenzoic acid. Both 
Matthews et al. (1973) and Byard and Golberg (1973) found that solvent extraction and t.l.c. in 
neutral solutions would give rise to artifactual metabolites. In neither the Kennedy et al. (1972) 
study which used [3)4C]saccharin from Monsanto Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA), nor the Pitkin et 
al. (1971) study, which used [14C]saccharin from Mallinckrodt Chemical Corp, was the purity of 
the saccharin specified. It seems likely that the results obtained from experiments conducted by 
Kennedy et al. (1972) and Pitkin et al. (1971) might be due to some unidentified impurity similar 
to that found by Byard and Golberg (1973). Experiments aimed at the induction ofmetabolism 
of [14C]saccharin by pretreatment with phenobarbital (Byard and Golberg, 1973) also failed to 
induce metabolic reactions producing 2-sulfamoylbenzoic acid, 2-sulfobenzoic acid, C0 2, or the 
carbonate. 
Lethco and Wallace (1975) explained the presence of [14C]saccharin metabolites as a slight 
breakdown ofsaccharin due to simple decomposition rather than enzymatic mechanisms. 
Although the authors' data were substantiated by the large number ofanimals studied and the 
consistency ofthe extent ofmetabolism over a wide range ofdoses in various species, the 
saccharin molecule is resistant to chemical decarboxylation and thus slight breakdown to C0 2 and 
C0 3 2-seems unlikely (Renwick, 1986).

NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
6.3 Pharmacokinetics 
The human data generated by Sweatman et al. ( 1981) fitted a two-compartment model 
(plasma and renal clearance) for i.v. administration ofa bolus dose of saccharin (sodium saccharin 
dihydrate; 10 mg!kg) in the presence or absence ofprobenecid (competes for and inhibits renal 
tubular secretion of organic ions). Probenecid was administered (500 mg) 2 and 12 hours before 
and 2 hours after the i.v. dose of saccharin. Saccharin was rapidly eliminated via the urine after 
i.v. administration (t112 about 70 min). A significant decrease in the elimination rate constant 
(40%) and in the plasma clearance (36%) rate occurred when the i.v. dose was given during 
probenecid treatment. Thus, tubular secretion is responsible for the elimination ofa minimum of 
40% ofcirculating saccharin in humans, which is consistent with the high renal clearance noted in 
this study. The fact that plasma clearance values were slightly less than the corresponding renal 
clearance suggests the absence ofsignificant metabolism. This supports earlier studies using [14C] 
saccharin in humans (Byard et al., 1974; Ballet al., 1977) that failed to detect significant 
metabolism after oral administration. 
Sweatman and Renwick (1980) dosed ten male rats with low i.v. bolus doses (1, 20, 50 
mg/kg). The plasma concentration-time curve clearly showed a biphasic decline during the first 2 
hours. The plasma levels fit the equation 
0213Cp= 3.12De + 1.35De-0· \ 
where Cp is the plasma concentration in J.Lg mL-1 at time (t) and Dis the dose in mg/kg. About 
90% ofthe dose was recovered in the urine within 2 hours. This finding is consistent with the 
elimination t112 (30 minutes). 
6.4 Structure-Activity Relationships 
No data were found. 
6.5 	Cell Proliferation 
Experimental details for the studies described in this section are presented in Table 6-1. 
6.5.1 Hamsters 
Neither hyperplasia of the urinary bladder nor significantly increased DNA synthesis was 
observed in 6-wk-old male Syrian hamsters administered a 5% sodium saccharin diet for 20 wk 
(Fukushima et al., 1983). 
6.5.2 Mice 
Neither hyperplasia of the urinary bladder nor significantly increased DNA synthesis was 
observed in 6-wk-old male B6C3Fl mice administered a 5% sodium saccharin diet for 20 wk 
(Fukushima et al., 1983). 
6.5.3 Rats 
Lessel (1971) reported that saccharin was positive for hyperplasia in rats exposed to a 
5% saccharin diet for 2 yr. Of 5 bladders from animals exposed to 5% saccharin, 1 male and 1 
female had urothelial hyperplasia. IARC (1980) noted the small number ofbladders examined 
histologically. 
76 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
A 5% sodium saccharin diet fed to 6-wk-old F344 male rats for up to 18 wk induced 
vacuolar degeneration ofthe bladder urothelium after 3 wk and simple hyperplasia at 5 wk. The 
degree ofhyperplasia increased with a display of mitotic figures, hyperplastic foci and 
pleomorphic microvilli starting at 9 wk. Increased thymidine uptake (5-to 8-fold the rate seen in 
controls) was present in the bladders of exposed rats at all time periods measured through 18 wk 
(Fukushima and Cohen, 1980). 
Hooson et al. (1980) reported mild focal urothelial hyperplasia in 1150 female Wistar rats 
exposed to 2 g sodium saccharin/kg/day for 2 yr. IARC (1980) noted that the rats were not 
started on the test diet at weaning, but after several wk on a normal diet. 
Six-week-old male and female F344 rats fed up to 5% sodium saccharin in a stock diet 
alone for 32 wk did not develop simple, papillary, or nodular hyperplasia (Nakanishi et al., 
1980a). However, rats initiated with BBN for 4 wk and then fed 5% sodium saccharin stock diet 
for 32 wk developed papillary and nodular hyperplasia (Nakanishi et al., 1980a). 
In a 2-generation study, male and female F1 Charles River CD rats exposed to up to 7.5% 
sodium saccharin in the diet for up to 2 yr had an increased incidence ofurinary bladder 
hyperplasia at the 7.5% dose, but it was not morphologically precancerous. Exposure to 0.01, 
0.1, 1.0, or 5.0% sodium saccharin had no effect on the incidence ofhyperplasia (Taylor et al., 
1980). 
Lawson and Hertzog (1981) reported that sodium saccharin did not induce DNA 
synthesis in male Sprague Dawley rat bladder epithelium, as measured by an LI or by specific 
activity ofDNA. Animals were fed 7.5% sodium saccharin diet for 50 wk with interim sacrifices 
throughout. [Methyl-3H]thymidine was injected intraperitoneally 1 hour before death. 
Murasaki and Cohen (1981) studied the dose response relationship between sodium 
saccharin exposure and cell proliferation in the urinary bladders of five-week-old male F344 rats 
fed sodium saccharin in the diet for 10 wk. The results ofthis experiment showed a dose-related 
increase in tritiated thymidine LI, the presence ofpleomorphic microvilli, and hyperplasia. The 
no-observable-effect-level (NOEL) for statistically significant changes in LI was 0.1 %. 
The incidences ofsimple hyperplasia (25/32 vs. 1128 controls) and papillary or nodular 
hyperplasia (20/32 vs. 0/28 controls) were significantly increased in male ACI rats administered 
5% sodium saccharin in the diet for 52 wk beginning at 6 wk ofage. At least half ofthe ACI rats 
were infected with the bladder parasite Trichosomoides crassicauda (Fukushima et al., 1983). 
Females were not evaluated. 
Male F344 rats fed a 5% sodium saccharin diet for up to 20 wk beginning at 6 wk ofage 
developed hyperplasia of the urinary bladder and significantly increased DNA synthesis at 20 
wk (Fukushima et al., 1983). 
Sodium saccharin induced hyperplasia ofthe urinary bladder in male ACI rats but not in 
F344, Sprague Dawley, or Wistar rats administered 5% sodium saccharin in the diet for 52 wk 
beginning at 6 wk ofage. However, the concentration ofurinary MgNH 4PO4 crystals was greater 
in all strains oftreated rats than in their respective controls (Fukushima et al., 1983). The ACI 
rats also developed urinary bladder papillomas and carcinomas. Females were not evaluated. 
The effects ofsodium saccharin on freeze ulceration-induced cell proliferation in male 
F344 rats were studied by Murasaki and Cohen (1983b ). The authors found that the degree of 
microvilli formation and hyperplasia was similar for the 2-wk period following freeze ulceration 
77 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
whether or not 5% sodium saccharin was administered immediately following the procedure. In 
another experiment, Murasaki and Cohen (1983b) found that sodium saccharin administered 2 or 
8 wk following freeze ulceration produced a similar increase in hyperplasia, Ll, and microvilli. 
Hasegawa and Cohen (1986) studied the impact ofthe cation associated with different 
dosage forms of saccharin. In male F344 rats fed a 5% sodium saccharin, acid saccharin, 
potassium saccharin, or calcium saccharin diet for 10 wk, the LI was increased approximately 2­
fold for calcium saccharin, 3-fold for potassium saccharin, and 9-fold for sodium saccharin. No 
increased LI was found for acid saccharin, and only the increased LI associated with sodium and 
potassium salt exposures reached statistical significance. A statistically significant increase in 
rats with hyperplasia was found in the sodium saccharin-treated group. Evidence of simple 
hyperplasia following potassium saccharin and calcium saccharin exposure, and increases in 
microvilli with potassium saccharin exposure were found. However, these changes were not 
statistically significant. 
Tatematsu et al. (1986) found that a 5% sodium saccharin diet for 21 wk did not increase 
DNA synthesis in the bladder epithelium of male Fischer rats. 
A 2-generation study conducted by Masui et al. (1988 abstr.), evaluated the urinary 
bladder proliferative effects upon fetal and neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes, when 
their dams were fed a 5% sodium saccharin diet prior to mating and up to weaning. In control 
and sodium saccharin-treated fetuses at days 17 and 21 of gestation, the Lis were similar in both 
groups. Similar Lis were also found for both exposed and control rats at day 7 after birth. 
However, the LI was greater in sodium saccharin-treated rats (higher in females than in males), at 
day 21 after birth, compared to controls. 
Garland et al. (1989b) found that the proliferative effects of sodium saccharin were 
dependent upon diet. In Experiment 1, five-week-old male F344 rats were given 5 or 7.5% 
sodium saccharin in Pro lab 3200, NIH-07 or AIN-76 diet for 4 or 10 wk. In Experiment 2, male 
F344 rats and 4-wk-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed with 5 and 7.5% sodium saccharin 
in Pro lab 3200 or Purina 5002 diet for 10 wk. The results of Experiment 1 showed that sodium 
saccharin had a greater effect on bladder urothelium in the rats fed the Prolab diet compared with 
those on the NIH diet. In addition, there was little effect in the rats on the AIN diet. Effects 
included urothelial hyperplasia at 4 and 10 wk and an increased thymidine LI for the Pro lab and 
NIH diet at 10 wk. In Experiment 2, the response was greater in F344 rats than in Sprague­
Dawley rats and greater for the Pro lab rather than the Purina diet for hyperplasia, increased LI, 
and evidence ofurothelial damage. 
Male F344 rats were exposed to 3, 5, or 7.5% sodium saccharin diet (Prolab feed) for 4, 7, 
or 10 wk in a dose-response experiment conducted by Cohen et al. (1990). Cell exfoliation and 
necrosis were evident at 10 wk in the group fed 3% sodium saccharin. An apparent progression 
from mild to more severe necrotic changes during the 4-to 1 0-wk period was found in the 5 and 
7.5% sodium saccharin group. In the 5% sodium saccharin-exposed group, a doubling ofthe LI 
with extensive cell damage was noted. In the 7.5% sodium saccharin-exposed group, the LI was 
increased several fold, with evidence ofhyperplasia. 
The effects of diet on cell proliferation induced by sodium saccharin were also studied by 
Debiec-Rychter and Wang (1990). Male F344 rats were exposed to 5% sodium saccharin in 
either Wayne or AIN-76A diet for 2, 4, 6, 10, or 16 wk. Both diets increased the LI 
78 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
approximately 5-fold when measured at 2, 4, 6, 10, or 16 wk. The authors also found that 2% 
sodium bicarbonate increased the LI for the AIN-76A diet 6-to 9-fold. In addition, a sodium 
saccharin and sodium bicarbonate combination proved to have an additive effect on cell 
proliferation, except at the 2-wk interval. A similar study was not conducted for the Wayne diet. 
Garland et al. ( 1991) reported that sodium saccharin at 7.5% dietary concentration was 
positive for hyperplasia in male SD rats exposed in utero from conception up to 90 days ofage. 
Urothelial hyperplasia was not present at 30 days ofage. 
Two separate studies conducted by Garland et al. (1994) and Uwagawa et al. (1994) 
demonstrated that NCI-Black-Reiter (NBR) rats, which do not produce 2-globulin (the male rat­
specific, low molecular weight urinary protein), do not exhibit sodium saccharin-induced urinary 
bladder cell proliferation. Male NBR, F344, and castrated F344 rats were fed 7.5% sodium 
saccharin in Pro lab 3200 diet for 10 wk. The most severe changes were found in both normal and 
castrated sodium saccharin-exposed F344 rats. Hyperplastic changes were found in the bladders 
of 7110 intact F344 rats compared with 1110 NBR rats. Hyperplasia was not found in the 
bladders ofcontrol rats. Although the 2J.1-globulin urinary content in castrated F344 rats has 
been reported to be only 10% ofthat in intact normal F344 rats (Roy and Neuhaus, 1967; cited 
by Garland et al., 1994), examination ofthe saccharin-treated castrated F344 rats urinary 
bladders revealed that 4/10 showed signs ofhyperplasia (Garland et al.,1994). 
Uwagawa et al. (1994) exposed 6-wk-old F344 and NBR rats to 5% sodium saccharin, 
5% sodium ascorbate, or 3% uracil for 8 wk. In both strains, the most severe urothelial changes 
were induced by uracil as shown by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Sodium ascorbate­
induced simple hyperplasia was found in the bladders ofF344 rats but not in NBR rats. Sodium 
saccharin did not induce hyperplasia in the bladders ofNBR; uracil-induced hyperplasia, 
however, was found in both strains. Increases in the BrdU Lis were found in F344 rats 
administered uracil(> 50-fold), ascorbate (36-fold), or sodium saccharin (20-fold). 
Fischer 344 rats exposed to a 7.5% sodium saccharin diet for 10 wk developed 
hyperplasia. Amorphous precipitate was present in exposed rats along with an increased 
incidence ofurothelial simple hyperplasia (Cohen et al., 1995a). 
Sodium saccharin was positive for cell proliferation in male and female F344 rats exposed 
to a 5% sodium saccharin diet for 21 or 91 days; the effects were reversible over time (Cohen et 
al., 1995b). 
6.5.4 Guinea Pigs 
Neither hyperplasia ofthe urinary bladder nor significantly increased DNA synthesis was 
observed in 6-wk-old male Hartley guinea pigs administered a 5% sodium saccharin diet for 20 
wk (Fukushima et al., 1983). 
6.5.5 Nonhuman Primates 
Sodium saccharin was negative for cell proliferation in Macaca mulatta monkeys fed 20, 
100, or 500 mglkg/day in diet for 79 months. Histopathological examination ofurinary bladders, 
kidneys, and testis ofsurviving and deceased animals showed no abnormal pathology 
(McChesney et al., 1977 abstr.; cited by IARC, 1980).

6.6 Cell Proliferation with Co-Administration of Known Carcinogens 
6.6.1 N-Butyl-N-( 4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN) 
Urinary bladder hyperplasia was enhanced in 6-wk-old male and female F344 rats 
exposed to 2000, 10,000, or 50,000, but not 400 ppm, sodium saccharin in the diet following 
BBN pretreatment. Exposure to sodium saccharin without BBN pretreatment did not induce any 
changes in urinary bladders ofrats of either sex (Nakanishi et al., 1980a). 
The effects of sequential administration (initiation/promotion protocol) of0.01% BBN in 
drinking water and 5.0% sodium saccharin in feed and concurrent administration ofO.OOl% BBN 
in drinking water and 5.0% sodium saccharin in feed, were studied in 8-wk-old male Wistar rats 
by Nakanishi et al. (1980b). In the first experiment (sequential administration), rats received 
BBN for 4 wk and then sodium saccharin for an additional32 wk. In the second experiment 
(concurrent administration), rats were fed both BBN and sodium saccharin for 40 wk. There was 
an enhancement ofurinary bladder hyperplasia and bladder tumors when rats were exposed to 
BBN and sodium saccharin either sequentially or concurrently, while sodium saccharin alone 
caused urinary bladder urothelial hyperplasia. 
Nakanishi et al. (1982) reported that there was a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the 
incidences of simple, papillary, or nodular urinary bladder hyperplasia in male F344 rats (age not 
specified) initiated with 0.01% BBN in drinking water for 4 wk and then fed 5% sodium 
saccharin in the diet for an additional32 wk, as compared to rats administered BBN alone (simple 
hyperplasia: 27/29 vs. 19/28; papillary or nodular hyperplasia: 24/29 vs. 11/28). 
6.6.2 2-Acetylaminofluorene (AAF) 
Sodium saccharin was positive for hyperplasia in female Horton SD rats fed a 5% sodium 
saccharin diet for 40 wk with co-administration of AAF. Hyperplasia ofthe urinary bladder 
mucosal lining occurred in all control and treated females fed AAF. The hyperplasia was most 
pronounced in the AAF/sodium saccharin-exposed animals, with one ofthese rats displaying 
squamous metaplasia and precancerous changes in the mucosal epithelium. IARC noted that the 
small number ofanimals used, and the fact that food consumption was not measured, prevented 
the evaluation of AAF and sodium saccharin exposure (Ershoffand Baja, 1974; cited by IARC, 
1980). 
Nakanishi et al. (1982) reported that there was a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the 
incidences of simple, papillary, or nodular urinary bladder hyperplasia in male F344 rats (age not 
specified) initiated with 0.02% AAF in the diet for 4 wk and then fed 5% sodium saccharin in the 
diet for an additional32 wk, as compared to rats administered BBN alone (simple hyperplasia: 
6/29 vs. 0/28; papillary or nodular hyperplasia: 4/29 vs. 0/28). 
6.6.3 N-Methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) 
There was an increase in the number ofproliferative bladder lesions in female Wistar rats 
(age not specified) administered a single 0.15 mL intravesicular dose of MNU, followed 2 wk 
later by daily administration ofeither 2 g/kg o-toluenesulfonamide-free sodium saccharin or 2 g/kg 
sodium saccharin containing 40 mglkg o-toluenesulfonamide for 2 yr, as compared to a control 
group given MNU alone (incidence not given) (Hooson et al., 1980).

7.0 MECHANISMS 
Summary: Bladder tumors found predominantly in male rats exposed to high dietary 
concentrations of sodium saccharin (equal to or greater than 1% ofthe diet) prior to birth, at 
birth, or starting at up to 35 days of age are thought to occur and proceed in association with 
elevated urinary sodium ion concentration and pH above 6.5. Implications that the sodium ion, 
itself, may be at least partially responsible for the carcinogenic effects observed in the male rat 
bladder stem from studies involving many other sodium salts (e.g., of succinic acid and ascorbic 
acid) eliciting similar effects in the male rat. In addition, when rat bladder epithelial cells were 
incubated with sodium saccharin, calcium saccharin, potassium saccharin, sodium ascorbate, 
sodium chloride, sodium citrate, potassium chloride, or calcium chloride in vitro for 24 hours, all 
of the sodium salts proved to be cytotoxic, while the other salts did not display similar effects. 
Studies using diets varying in pH have shown that sodium saccharin does not significantly 
promote proliferation in the male rat urinary bladder when fed in the acidic AIN-76A diet, but 
sodium saccharin did increase urothelial proliferation when fed in the Prolab 3200 (alkaline) diet. 
A number of studies have shown that pH above 6.5 and increased urinary sodium ion 
concentration in the male rat urinary bladder enhance the formation ofurinary silicate crystals. 
These crystals have been shown to form by the binding ofurinary proteins to saccharin, and may 
act as microabrasives in the rat urinary bladder, causing regenerative hyperplasia (increase in cell 
number) and increased cell proliferation, which, when sustained over a lifetime, provide the basis 
for urinary bladder tumorigenesis. The anatomy ofthe rat bladder is thought to play a role in 
rendering the rat susceptible to bladder tumorigenesis. It is known that the horizontal position of 
the rat during urination leaves the rat prone to the retention ofcalculi in the bladder, and the 
formation and retention ofprecipitate in the rat bladder has been linked to the induction of 
tumors predominantly in the male rat. 
Other factors associated with induction ofurinary bladder tumors in the rat include high 
urine volume, low urine osmolality, and intrinsically high urinary protein, especially in male rats. 
It is noteworthy that saccharin binds to urinary proteins, including a2J.L-globulin which is 
common in male rats, and that the most extensive mechanistic studies have been conducted only 
in male rats. Whether the female rat positive urinary bladder response seen in 
initiation/promotion studies is associated with increased urinary protein and urinary crystal 
formation has not been adequately studied. Furthermore, extensive mechanistic studies in mice 
exposed to high doses of sodium saccharin, with or without previous exposure to a urinary 
bladder initiator, have not been done to definitively rule out the possibility that mice could also 
develop urinary bladder neoplasia under specific experimental conditions. 
The constellation ofphysiological characteristics ofurine in rats fed high doses ofsodium 
saccharin, particularly commencing at times when intrinsic bladder urothelial proliferation is high, 
would not be expected in humans exposed to normal usage levels ofsodium saccharin.

7.1 Mechanism of Urinary Bladder Tumorigenesis Found Predominantly in Male Rats 
Long-term studies ofsodium saccharin have shown that bladder tumors are the most 
common malignancies and that they occur predominantly in the male rat. Tumors found in the 
bladder are detected only when sodium saccharin is fed at high dietary levels (equal to or greater 
than 1% in rats) beginning at birth or when fetal rats are exposed in utero by feeding the dams 5% 
sodium saccharin diet (Schoenig et al., 1985; for review, see Velazquez et al., 1996). Schoenig et 
al. (1985) also found that in utero exposure was not necessary and that the incidence ofbladder 
tumors in rats given 5% sodium saccharin from birth was essentially identical to that in rats fed 
5% sodium saccharin prior to conception and throughout life (for review, see Renwick, 1993; 
Williams and Whysner, 1996). 
Cohen et al. (1991b) offered the following hypothesis to describe the events leading to 
urinary bladder tumorigenesis in male rats: When sodium saccharin is fed to male rats at high 
dietary levels (about 2.5%), the concentration ofurinary sodium is increased and the pH level is 
elevated (above 6.5). Under these conditions, binding ofsaccharin and male-rat-specific a2J.1­
globulin results in the formation ofsilicon-containing crystallized precipitate in the bladder (for 
review, see Ellwein and Cohen, 1990; Burin et al., 1995a; Cohen et al., 1995d; Velazquez et al., 
1996). After binding, the precipitate enters the bladder urothelial cells and is cytotoxic. Acting 
as microabrasives, the silicate and precipitate particles irritate the mucosa and cause focal 
necrosis. The loss ofurothelial cells results in regenerative hyperplasia and increased cell 
proliferation, which, when sustained over the rats' lifetime, provides the basis for urinary bladder 
tumorigenesis. Cohen et al. (1991a) further hypothesized that diet-, dose-, species-, and sex­
specific effects of saccharin may be related to the formation ofthe particles (for review, see Burin 
et al., 1995a; Velazquez, 1996). 
7 .1.1 The Role ofpH in the Promotion ofBladder Carcino~enesis in Male Rats 
Studies indicate that a urinary pH higher than 6.5 promotes the tumorigenicity of sodium 
saccharin in male rats (for reviews, see Murai et al., 1997; Cohen et al., 1995d). For instance, 
Okamura et al. ( 1991) compared the effects of sodium saccharin on 5-wk -old male F344 rats 
initiated with 0.2% F ANFT for 4 weeks followed by administration for 100 weeks ofeither 0 or 
5% sodium saccharin in either Prolab 3200 or AIN-76A diet. In rats, administration ofAIN-76A 
diet results in a strongly acidic urine, with a pH lower than 6.0 (for review, see Cohen, 1995c; 
Velazquez et al., 1996) while Prolab 3200 produces a neutral or slightly alkaline urinary pH 
(Fisher et al., 1989). [Humans tend to have acidic urine, with a pH between 5.0 and 6.0, although 
diet can alter this (Cohen, 1995c)]. The data from the study by Okamura et al. (1991) 
demonstrated that sodium saccharin did not significantly promote urinary bladder tumors in the 
male rat iffed an AIN-76A diet. However, there was a significant increase the incidence of 
bladder tumors ifmale rats were fed the Pro lab 3200 diet. 
A study by Garland et al. (1989b) also evaluated the responses of5-wk-old male F344 
rats to sodium saccharin administered in different diets. However, while Okamura et al. (1991) 
used tumor formation as an endpoint, Garland et al. (1989b) looked only at cellular proliferation 
in the urinary bladder, presumably because ofthe short duration ofthe study (10 weeks). Rats 
were either administered 0 or 7.5% sodium saccharin in Prolab 3200, AIN-76A, or NIH-07 diet 
and killed after 4 weeks, or they were administered 0, 5, or 7.5% sodium saccharin in these same 
91 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
diets and killed after 1 0 weeks. In rats killed after 4 weeks of treatment, there was a significantly 
higher incidence of hyperplasia with administration ofsodium saccharin and this incidence was 
higher in rats fed the Prolab diet than in rats fed the NIH diet. There was little response when 
sodium saccharin was administered in the AIN-76A diet. In the group ofrats killed after 
treatment for 10 weeks, there was a similar trend (these rats also demonstrated a dose-dependent 
increase in hyperplasia). Since the urinary pH ofrats fed sodium saccharin in the NIH-07 diet is 
known to be slightly lower than the urinary pH in rats fed Prolab 3200, and the urinary pH of 
rats fed AIN-76A is known to be even lower than that of rats fed NIH-07 (ibid.), these results 
are consistent with the hypothesis that urinary pH participates in the mediation of the 
proliferative response in urinary bladders of male rats exposed to sodium saccharin. 
The findings ofOkamura et al. (1991) and Garland et al. (1989b) imply that alkaline 
urinary pH alone was responsible for mediating urothelial proliferation, but other factors might 
also explain this phenomenon. For instance, while different diets have been shown to produce 
different urinary pH levels, they also can produce different levels of ions such as calcium, 
potassium and sodium, and silicates (Cohen, 1995c). Other studies, however, have supported a 
role for urinary pH in saccharin-induced carcinogenesis, showing that a pH above 6.5 greatly 
enhances the formation of the bladder epithelium-irritating urinary silicate crystals in male rats 
fed sodium saccharin (for review, see Cohen et al., 1991a). For a review of the role ofpH in 
oncogenesis, see Harguindey et al. (1995). 
7 .1.2 The Role of Sodium Concentration in the Promotion ofBladder Carcinogenesis in 
Male Rats 
There is evidence indicating that induction ofbladder carcinogenesis in male rats exposed 
to saccharin is increased under conditions of high urinary sodium ion concentration. For instance, 
Hasegawa and Cohen (1986) fed weanling male F344 rats the sodium, potassium, or calcium salt 
of saccharin, or acid saccharin as 5% of the diet for ten weeks. They found that sodium saccharin 
induced a significantly higher level of urinary bladder epithelial proliferation than potassium 
saccharin. Calcium saccharin and acid saccharin, on the other hand, did not significantly change 
the bladder epithelium. Anderson et al. (1988) found similar results in weanling male CD rats. 
Like Hasegawa and Cohen (1986), they fed sodium saccharin, potassium saccharin, calcium 
saccharin, or acid saccharin to rats for 10 weeks and noticed that only sodium saccharin and 
potassium saccharin produced hyperplasia in the bladder. In a later study by Cohen et al. 
(1991b), after a 6-wk initiation period with 0.2% FANFT, sodium saccharin, administered as 3% 
or 5% ofthe diet for 72 weeks, was shown to be tumorigenic in male F344 rat bladders while 
calcium saccharin was only slightly so and acid saccharin was not at all. 
In a review written by Cohen et al. (1997), it was noted that in rats, oral administration of 
sodium saccharin causes an increase in cell proliferation in the urothelium that is more 
pronounced than that induced by potassium saccharin, whereas calcium saccharin produces only 
slight changes and acid saccharin has no effect on the urinary bladder. It was also noted that 
these differences in potency occur even though urinary saccharin concentrations do not vary 
greatly among rats administered the different forms of saccharin. Refer to Table 7-1 for a 
summary of the effects ofvarious forms of saccharin on the rat urinary bladder. Refer to Table 
7-2 for results ofurine analyses in rats given various forms ofsaccharin. 
92 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
While sodium saccharin has been shown to induce carcinogenesis in the male rat bladder, 
so have many other sodium salts including those ofvitamin C (Fukushima et al., 1986), glutamate 
and bicarbonate (for review see Cohen, 1995b), and succinic acid (Otoshi et al., 1993) (most of 
these studies did not evaluate the responses of female rats). This implies that the sodium ion, 
itself, may be at least partially responsible for these effects. Studies supporting this idea include 
those by Shioya et al. (1994) and Shibata et al. (1989), both of which only evaluated the 
responses ofmale rats. A list of sodium salts that produce changes in the rat bladder is provided 
in Table 7-3. 
The results of an in vitro study performed by Garland et al. (1989a) suggest that the 
carcinogenic effect on the bladder of a high urinary sodium ion concentration could be mediated 
by the cytotoxicity ofthese ions. Transformed rat bladder epithelial cells (sex ofdonor animals 
not specified) were incubated in sodium saccharin, calcium saccharin, potassium saccharin, 
sodium ascorbate, sodium chloride, sodium citrate, potassium chloride, or calcium chloride for 24 
hours and then attachment and viability ofthe cells were assessed. All ofthe sodium salts (and 
potassium saccharin) decreased cell attachment and viability, while potassium chloride and 
calcium chloride did neither. Calcium saccharin decreased only cell viability. 
Another possible mechanism for sodium-induced carcinogenesis is direct induction of 
cellular proliferation and/or DNA synthesis by sodium ions (for review, see Cohen, 1995c ). 
Several in vitro studies support this hypothesis. For example, Burns and Rozengurt (1984) used 
confluent quiescent Swiss mouse 3T3 cells to demonstrate that initiation of DNA synthesis in 
these cells by various stimulants was inhibited by limiting extracellular sodium ion concentration. 
Normally, 3T3 cells will initiate DNA synthesis when growth factors are included in their 
incubation media. However, when Burns and Rozengurt (1984) included one growth factor (i.e., 
epidermal growth factor, vasopressin, or insulin) in the media (serum-free), and removed 
extracellular sodium ions, there was no initiation of DNA synthesis. 
Another study by Cameron et al. (1980) evaluated intracellular sodium ion concentrations 
in slowly and rapidly dividing cells, and in tumor cells. They found that sodium ion 
concentrations were highest in tumor cells and lowest in slowly dividing cells. They concluded 
that high sodium ion concentrations were, associated with mitogenesis while very high levels 
were associated with oncogenesis. However, the studies do not necessarily provide any support 
for the hypothesis that extraneous high sodium ion concentrations were responsible for induction 
of cellular proliferation or oncogenesis. 
The most likely mechanism for a carcinogenic response to sodium saccharin mediated by 
sodium ions is the interation of sodium ions with proteins in the urine (Cohen, 1995c). It has 
been shown that urinary proteins in rats bind to saccharin to produce a crystallized precipitate 
(Cohen, 1995b; Cohen et al., 1995a), which may act as an abrasive in the rat bladder, causing 
regenerative hyperplasia (Cohen et al., 1990; Hicks, 1984). The formation of this precipitate is 
greatly enhanced by high sodium ion concentrations (Cohen et al., 1991a), thus raising the 
possibility that high sodium ion concentration is a necessary condition for precipitate formation. 
Renwick ( 1993) stated that the urinary concentration ofthe anion of sodium saccharin 
does not play a role in the overall mechanism for tumorigenesis in the rat bladder. In addition, 
Renwick (1993) suggests that dietary sodium saccharin provides a vehicle for the delivery of 
"massive" but non-toxic amounts of sodium ions to the urinary bladder. However, the sodium 
93 
NTP Report on CMJ' p IH 1'997 Background Document for Saccharin 
ion concentrations in the feed containing carcinogenic doses of sodium saccharin are not much 
higher than in the rat feed alone. For example, Purina Rodent Chow consists of0.3% sodium 
ions or 3000 ppm. When comparing this concentration to the highest sodium saccharin 
concentration known to promote tumorigenesis (7.5% or 75,000 ppm), we calculated that the 
sodium ion concentration in the feed at this dose was approximately 3-fold that found in a 
typical rat chow (75,000 ppm x 12.5% sodium ions in sodium saccharin= 9400 ppm). Although 
a 7.5% sodium saccharin diet increased the concentration ofsodium ions approximately 3-fold, 
this concentration scarcely represents a large increase from the usual daily dietary intake of 
sodium ions. 
7 .1.3 The Combined Effect ofpH Level and Sodium Concentration 
While both pH and sodium ions have been shown to affect cell proliferation in the 
bladder, most likely these two parameters do not act in isolation but are part of a set of 
parameters that regulate tumorigenesis. This hypothesis is supported by a study conducted by 
Fukushima et al. (1988) in which male F344 rats were initiated with 0.05% N-butyl-N-(4­
hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN) and then fed a diet containing either 3% sodium bicarbonate, 
1% sodium chloride, or a control diet. Sodium bicarbonate was found to increase urinary pH and 
sodium ion concentration and promote urinary bladder carcinogenesis. Administration ofsodium 
chloride produced an increase in urinary sodium ions but not pH, and did not promote urinary 
bladder carcinogenesis. 
Ito and Fukushima (1989) also found that both elevated pH and elevated sodium ion 
concentration were necessary conditions for induction ofbladder tumorigenesis. They initiated 
male rats with 0.05% BBN and then administered either ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate, sodium 
bicarbonate, or ammonium chloride alone or in several different combinations. Promotion of 
urinary bladder carcinogenesis occurred only under conditions ofboth elevated urinary pH and 
elevated urinary sodium ion concentration, induced by the administration ofsodium bicarbonate 
and sodium ascorbate. 
7.1.4 The Association Between Increased Urinazy Output and Sodium Saccharin-Induced 
Bladder Tumors 
Schoenig et al. (1985) found that rats that ingested 7.5% sodium saccharin in a two­
generation bioassay and developed bladder tumors had a higher urine volume throughout their 
lives than did those that did not develop bladder tumors. Schoenig et al. (1985) also found that 
the difference in urine volume between the non-tumor bearing group and the untreated controls 
was almost as great as the difference between the sodium saccharin-treated tumor bearing and 
non-tumor bearing rats. 
Anderson et al. (1987b) studied the effect ofinherent urine output (high urine volume or 
low urine volume) on the response ofmale rats fed 7.5% dietary sodium saccharin for 10 weeks. 
Rats exposed to 7.5% dietary sodium saccharin for 10 weeks showed an increased incidence of 
bladder epithelial hyperplasia (12/20 rats exposed to sodium saccharin vs. 2/20 controls). The 
incidence ofhyperplasia was similar ( 6/1 0) in the sodium saccharin high and low urine output 
groups. One ofthe two control rats that had hyperplastic lesions in the bladder showed evidence 
94 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
of inflammation and had a higher than average urine output, while the other had the highest urine 
output in the control group (73 g/kg). 
Anderson et al. (1987a) found that high urine output rats in the control group consumed 
more feed than those in the low urine output control group. Therefore, the authors compared the 
mean daily sodium saccharin consumption between the exposed high and low urine output 
groups (glkg bw) for the 1 0-week period. The authors found that the high urine output group 
consumed 8.0 ±0.2 glkg bw and the low urine output group consumed 7.8 ±0.2 glkg bw feed 
containing 7.5% sodium saccharin on an average daily basis. However, urinary concentrations of 
saccharin were similar in the high and low urine mass groups ( 41 ± 3 and 46 ± 2 mg/mL, 
respectively). Thus, Anderson et al. (1987a) concluded that it is unlikely that a difference in 
urinary saccharin concentration or total saccharin exposure can account for the role ofhigh 
urinary volume in saccharin-associated bladder tumorigenicity. 
7.2 Dose Response in Cell Proliferation and Tumorigenesis 
Numerous studies have been conducted that suggest high doses ofsodium saccharin 
produce urinary bladder tumors in male rats. For example, Cohen et al. (1991b) and Fukushima 
et al. (1986) have demonstrated that the effects ofhigh dietary concentrations of sodium 
saccharin on male rat bladder epithelium are associated with increased urinary bladder tumor 
promotion. Cohen et al. (1989 abstr.) found that feeding male rats high doses of sodium 
saccharin (7.5%) beginning 5 weeks after birth increased cell proliferation in the bladder 
urothelium. Cohen and Ellwein (1991) suggested that approximately one-third ofthe total 
mitoses of the urothelium occurs within the first 3 weeks ofa rat's life. Therefore, when sodium 
saccharin dosing begins at birth, rather than after weaning, rats are somehow more susceptible to 
sodium saccharin-induced tumors in later life due to the increased cell proliferation occurring at 
this time. The increases ofcell proliferation observed after short periods ofhigh sodium ' 
saccharin administration are dose-responsive. Details of carcinogenesis experiments mentioned 
herein are in Table 4-1. 
Schoenig et al. (1985) conducted a 2-generation rat bioassay on sodium saccharin. This 
study involved 2500 second-generation male Charles River CD rats (F., between 21 and 38 days 
ofage; 6 treatment groups, 125 to 700 rats per group) receiving 1, 3, 4, 5, 6.25, and 7.5% sodium 
saccharin in their diet for up to 30 months. The parents (F0) ofthe F1 generation had been 
maintained on diets containing between 1 and 7.5% sodium saccharin. Except during mating, 
gestation, and lactation, all animals were housed individually in a single environmentally 
controlled room. The data resulting from this experiment, designed to determine the dose­
response for urinary bladder tumors, indicated that a 1% dietary level of sodium saccharin 
represented a no-effect level. Higher dietary concentrations showed a very steep dose-response, 
indicating that tumor incidence increased rapidly with an increase in the dose. For example, 
significant increases in the incidence ofprimary neoplasia (benign and malignant tumors) in the 
urinary bladder ofF1 male rats sacrificed during month 15 ofthis study were not found in the 1.0 
or 3.0% sodium saccharin group. However, pairwise comparisons between the control group 
(0.0% total primary neoplasia) and all groups treated with 4, 5, 6.25, and 7.5% sodium saccharin 
showed significant increases in the incidence ofbenign (2.1, 3.3, 10.0, and 15.3%, respectively) 
and malignant tumors (4.2, 9.2, 6.7, and 16.1%, respectively) alone as well as oftotal primary 
95 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
bladder neoplasia (6.3% to 31.4%). Total primary bladder neoplasia was also significantly higher 
in the 3.0% sodium saccharin group (1.7%). Therefore, the 1.0% sodium saccharin dietary level 
was considered to be a no-effect level for bladder neoplasia. However, 5 bladder tumors were 
found in the 1% sodium saccharin group and none were found in the concurrent controls. This 
finding prompted the authors to review the historical control data for the incidence ofprimary 
urinary bladder tumors in male Charles River CD rats at IRDC (Squire, 1985). The review 
included 10 studies that examined the urinary bladders from 982 male controls either in utero or 
over a lifetime. Ofthese animals, 863 survived for 67 weeks, which corresponds to the 
appearance ofthe first urinary bladder tumor observed in the bioassay conducted by Schoenig et 
al. (1985). No primary urinary bladder tumors appeared prior to week 67 in the controls ofthe 
ten studies reviewed. The percentage incidence oftumors was calculated from historical controls 
by using the number ofrats that survived until the first bladder tumor was observed as the 
denominator. These data showed that total primary bladder neoplasia ranged from 0.0 to 3.3% 
with a mean of 0.8%. The corresponding incidence oftotal primary bladder neoplasia at the 1% 
dietary sodium saccharin observed by Schoenig et al. (1985) was also 0.8%. These findings 
suggest that the NOEL (1% sodium saccharin dietary level) proposed by Schoenig et al. (1985) is 
not significantly different from the results obtained from the controls (0.8%) studied by Squire 
(1985), and that the background tumor incidence for this strain ofrat at IRDC was identical to 
that observed in the 1% sodium saccharin group (0.8%) studied by Schoenig et al. (1985). 
Murusaki et al. (1981), who studied the light microscopic and electron microscopic 
changes in the bladder of rats fed sodium saccharin (dietary concentrations between 0.1 and 5%), 
also reported a steep dose-response curve over a narrow range of dose levels above 1%. 
Furthermore, Nakanishi et al. (1980a) and West et al. (1986), using light microscopy, 
autoradiography, and scanning electron microscopy, detected cellular responses in male rat 
bladders only with sodium saccharin dietary concentrations of 2.5% to 5% beginning at 6 to 8 
weeks of age. Chappel (1992) reviewed and assessed the biological risk of sodium saccharin. 
The author stated that the steep dose-response curves representing both physiological changes 
in the urine and morphological changes in the urothelium provide strong evidence of a common 
threshold at a sodium saccharin dietary concentration between 1 and 3%. To Chappel (1992), 
these results provided strong evidence that these phenomena are interrelated. 
Ellwein and Cohen (1988), using model-based simulations, demonstrated that the 
proliferative effects (hyperplasia; increase in Ll) following high doses ofsodium saccharin are 
sufficient to explain tumorigenic effects in the rat urinary bladder without having to postulate a 
genotoxic influence. Their database was generated from a large series ofexperiments dealing with 
the increase in LI and hyperplasia after the administration ofhigh doses of sodium saccharin. 
The authors postulated a tumorigenic effect secondary to sodium saccharin administration only if 
it is administered during the neonatal period at a dose which will generate a cell proliferative 
response in the urothelium; and after weaning when ulcerations ofthe bladder occur. The authors 
suggested that a dietary level of at least 1% sodium saccharin is necessary for a cellular response 
to occur in the rat bladder, even though most experiments aimed at cellular responses detected by 
light microscopy, autoradiography, or scanning electron microscopy (West et al., 1986; Murusaki 
et al., 1981; Nakanishi et al., 1980a) have found these effects only at doses of2.5% or higher. 
96 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
Like Chappel (1992), Ellwein and Cohen (1990) suggested that saccharin exhibits a biological 
threshold. 
7.3 Relevance of Animal Cancers To Humans 
Numerous studies have investigated the carcinogenicity of sodium saccharin in rats 
(Cohen et al., 1995b; Cohen et al., 1990; Anderson, 1988; for review, see Oser, 1985; Williams 
and Whysner, 1996), mice (for review, see Oser, 1985), non-human primates (Thorgeirsson et al., 
1994) and humans (Risch et al., 1988; for reviews, see Elcock and Morgan, 1993; Chappel, 1992; 
Ellwein and Cohen, 1990; Morgan and Wong, 1985). These studies have revealed that it is 
mainly the male rat which is susceptible to the formation ofbladder tumors following chronic 
exposure to high doses of sodium saccharin (Cohen, 1995b; Chappel, 1992), i.e., greater than or 
equal to 1% ofthe diet (Ellwein and Cohen, 1990). A summary ofpositive mammalian 
carcinogenicity studies is presented in Table 7-4. An interspecies comparison of the effects of 
sodium saccharin on the urinary bladder is presented in Table 7-5, and a comparison ofthe 
effects of sodium saccharin in various rat strains is presented in Table 7-6. 
Results from animal studies suggest that there is an intrinsic difference between male rats 
and other animals in how they react to sodium saccharin exposures and, in particular, they imply 
that there may be a peculiarity of the male rat bladder which makes the male rat uniquely 
susceptible to cancer of this organ following sodium saccharin exposures. Most likely, this 
peculiarity is not of a genetic origin but is, rather, physiologically based (Weisburger, 1990), since 
sodium saccharin has been shown to be non-genotoxic in vivo (Ellwein and Cohen, 1990; Ashby, 
1985; Lutz and Schlatter, 1977). 
If the male rat bladder is indeed a unique organ with respect to its response to sodium 
saccharin, it would have to be concluded that male rats do not accurately represent humans when 
considering such a response and that it would therefore not be appropriate to extrapolate data 
from male rat exposure studies to humans. This section will investigate the validity ofthese 
statements by comparing the anatomy and physiology of the male rat bladder with the human 
bladder. 
7.3.1 Comparative Bladder Anatomy and Urine Chemistry 
The anatomy ofthe rat bladder is significantly different than that ofthe human bladder. 
For instance, the rat bladder is an abdominal organ, while the human bladder progresses from an 
abdominal organ in infancy and childhood to a pelvic organ in adulthood when the pelvis is fully 
developed and upright posture ofthe body is achieved (DeSesso, 1995). 
The upright/vertical posture of mature humans versus the horizontal posture of rats is 
highly relevant to the nature of bladder response to sodium saccharin when the process of 
urination is considered. Specifically, it is known that the vertical position ofhumans allows for a 
more efficient elimination ofcalculi from the bladder while the horizontal position ofthe rat 
during urination leaves the rat more prone to retention of such material (Burin et al., 1995b; 
Cohen, 1995b). 
Although other animals (e.g., mice) that maintain a horizontal position may also be 
susceptible to calculus retention, this phenomenon is uniquely relevant to rats when exposure to 
sodium saccharin is considered. This is due to the fact that sodium saccharin has been shown to 
97 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
induce precipitate formation solely in male rat urine (see Table 7-5) (Cohen, 1995b; Cohen et al., 
1995a; Cohen et al., 1991a), and the formation and retention ofthis precipitate has been linked to 
the formation oftumors ofthe male rat bladder (Cohen 1995b). Tumor formation may be the 
result ofchronic irritation, and the damage it causes to bladder urothelium (Burin et al., 1995b; 
Clayson et al., 1995; Ellwein and Cohen, 1988). The precipitate is composed ofmainly calcium 
phosphate, but also contains silicate, protein, saccharin, sulfur-containing substances, potassium, 
and chloride (Cohen, 1995b), and is jagged in nature (Cohen et al., 1989 abstr.). 
When the urothelium is damaged by abrasion, regenerative hyperplasia is likely to occur 
(Cohen et al., 1990; Hicks, 1983). This results in an increase in the number ofurothelial cell 
divisions (Cohen and Lawson, 1995) which may lead to tumor formation (Cohen and Ellwein, 
1991). 
After sodium saccharin exposure, the formation ofprecipitate in the male rat urine is 
thought to be the result ofan interaction in the urine between saccharin and the male rat-specific 
protein, a2J.L-globulin (Murai et al., 1997; Garland et al., 1994; Swenberg et al., 1992). Alpha 2J.L­
globulin is a low-molecular-weight protein, weighing less than 40 kDa (Hard, 1995). It is 
synthesized in the liver and is quantitatively the major protein found in male rat urine (Roy and 
Neuhaus, 1966). It is not present in significant quantities in female rat urine and is not 
synthesized by humans (Hard, 1995). 
It has been shown that rats lacking a2J.L-globulin are not as subject to bladder cell 
proliferation following sodium saccharin exposure as are rats producing this protein. Uwagawa et 
al. (1994) used the male NBR rat, which does not synthesize a2J.L-globulin, and the male F344 
rat, which does, to demonstrate this. After chronic administration (starting at 6 weeks ofage) of 
a diet containing 5% sodium saccharin, the F344 rat showed signs of cellular proliferation in the 
bladder urothelium, but the NBR rat did not. 
A study by Garland et al. (1994) supports the fmdings ofUwagawa et al. (1994). Four­
to 5-week-old intact F344, castrated F344, and NBR rats were administered 7.5% sodium 
saccharin in the diet for 10 weeks. Less cellular proliferation occurred in the bladders ofthe 
castrated rats, which had reduced levels ofa2J.L-globulin, than in the bladders ofintact F344 rats. 
Even less proliferation was seen in the bladders ofNBR rats, which had lower levels ofa2J.L­
globulin than the castrated rats. 
Since a2J.L-globulin is normally specific to the male rat and since this protein is thought to 
be at least partially responsible for the carcinogenicity of sodium saccharin in the bladder, a2J.L­
globulin in the urinary bladder is probably the physiologic peculiarity that renders the male rat 
bladder susceptible to a carcinogenic response to sodium saccharin (for review, see Swenberg et 
al., 1992). However, it is important to note that while Uwagawa et al. (1994) and Garland et al. 
( 1994) demonstrated an association between the presence ofa2J.L-globulin in the male rat bladder 
and the occurrence ofcellular proliferation ofthe bladder, no studies were found which evaluated 
the role ofa2J.L-globulin in the formation oftumors in these animals. 
It is also noteworthy that saccharin binds to other proteins besides a2J.L-globulin and that 
most extensive mechanistic studies have been conducted only in male rats. Whether the female 
98 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
rat positive bladder response seen in I/P studies is associated with an increase in protein has not 
been studied. 
Another problem with the accuracy ofthis hypothesis arises from integrating studies 
investigating the critical age ofsodium saccharin administration to male rats for induction of 
bladder tumors with those investigating the age-dependent expression ofa2J.1-globulin. It is 
thought that sodium saccharin produces urinary bladder tumors in male rats only if it is 
administered before the rats reach 35 days of age (Cohen et al., 1995b) unless exposure occurs 
after administration ofan initiating agent (for review, see Cohen et al., 1995a). In several studies 
in which rats were exposed to sodium saccharin beginning after this time period, there was no 
increase in the incidence ofbladder tumors in male rats (e.g., Homma et al., 1991; Murasaki and 
Cohen, 1981; Hooson et al., 1980; Schmahl, 1973; cited by IARC, 1980; for reviews, see Cohen 
and Ellwein, 1991a; National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council, 1974; cited by 
Arnold et al., 1980). It has also been shown that hepatic synthesis of a2J.1-globulin in the male 
rat does not begin until 35 to 40 days ofage (Roy et al., 1983) and is thus undetectable in male 
rats below this age (Neuhaus and Flory, 1978). Therefore, the time of susceptibility to induction 
by sodium saccharin ofcellular proliferation in the bladders ofmale rats does not correlate with 
the presence ofa2J.1-globulin in these rats. While this does not necessarily preclude a role for 
a2J.1-globulin in sodium saccharin carcinogenesis, it does raise some doubts. 
While the possibility ofa role for a2J.1-globulin in sodium saccharin carcinogenesis is 
attractive because it can account for differences in species (e.g., rat and human) and sex (e.g., male 
and female rats) responses to sodium saccharin, other mechanisms ofsodium saccharin 
carcinogenesis could exist that would also successfully explain these differences. For instance, 
proteins other than a2J.1-globulin may be responsible for the unique vulnerability ofmale rats to 
sodium saccharin-induced bladder tumorigenesis. Since male rats have up to 10 times more total 
protein in their urine than female rats (Lehman- McKeeman and Caudill, 1991) and about 90 times 
more total urinary protein than humans (Olson et al., 1990), the idea that a protein other than 
a2J.1-globulin can account for species and sex differences in sodium saccharin response is not 
implausible (for an interspecies comparison ofurine chemistries see Table 7-7). Few studies 
have investigated this hypothesis, although the role ofalbumin was examined by Homma et al. 
(1991 ). This group compared the response of analbuminemic rats to sodium saccharin exposure 
to the response ofSprague- Dawley rats. Neither strain developed abnormal bladder growths and 
the study was inconclusive. Since albumin levels in humans are known to be higher than levels in 
male rats (Hard, 1995), future studies should probably focus on investigating low-molecular­
weight proteins other than a2J.1-globulin that are more abundant in male rats than in female rats or 
humans (Olson et al., 1990). 
7.3.2 Dose-Res.ponse Extrapolation 
Two major issues to consider when deciding if dose-extrapolation from rats to humans is 
appropriate are the nature ofthe carcinogenic mechanism (i.e., does it operate in both rats and 
humans?) and the presence or absence ofa threshold in dose-response. In fact, the majority of 
data summarized in previous sections ofthis document indicate that the carcinogenic mechanism 
ofsodium saccharin may be unique to male rats, and that there is a threshold dose. 
99 
NTP Report on Carcinogens 1997 Background Document for Saccharin 
There is significant data indicating that the mechanism of sodium saccharin-induced 
bladder carcinogenesis in male rats is related to the formation and retention ofurinary precipitate 
formed under conditions ofhigh urinary pH and high sodium concentration and that this 
precipitate does not form in other species. 
Studies using diets varying in pH have shown that sodium saccharin does not significantly 
promote proliferation in the male rat urinary bladder when fed in the acidic AIN-76A diet, but 
sodium saccharin does increase urothelial proliferation when fed in the alkaline Prolab 3200 diet. 
It has also been shown that in rats, oral administration ofsodium saccharin causes an increase in 
cell proliferation in the urothelium that is more pronounced than that induced by potassium 
saccharin, whereas calcium saccharin produces only slight changes, and acid saccharin has no 
effect on the urinary bladder, even though urinary saccharin concentrations do not vary greatly 
between the different groups ofrats. In addition, while sodium saccharin has been shown to 
induce carcinogenesis in the male rat bladder, so have other sodium salts. 
There is also evidence from a number of studies that a threshold dose exists in male rats 
for sodium saccharin-induced bladder carcinogenesis, suggesting that use of a linear dose­
response model is not appropriate to estimate risk in humans. 
7.4 Additional Mechanistic Information 
7 .4.1 Inhibition ofApoptosis (Programmed Cell Death) 
Wright et al. (1994) reported that pretreatment with saccharin inhibited apoptosis 
(specifically the DNA fragmentation induced by UV light or tumor necrosis factor) in human 
histiocytic (U93 7) lymphoma cells. 
7.4.2 Intercellular Communication 
A review by IARC (1987a,b) reported that saccharin (form unspecified) inhibited 
intercellular communication in mammalian cells in vitro in two studies but not a third. These 
studies administered doses that were 1/2 those used in the tumor-positive rat studies. In a later 
review by Klaunig and Ruch (1990), the authors reported that saccharin inhibited intercellular 
communication in Chinese hamster lung V79 cells but not in primary mouse hepatocytes.

DESCRIPTION OF ONLINE SEARCHES FOR SACCHARIN 
AND SACCHARIN SALTS 
Initial online searches for saccharin [CASRN 128-44-9] and its sodium [81-07-2, 
anhydrous; 6155-57-3, dihydrate] and ammonium [6381-61-9] salts were performed in February 
and March 1996 in databases on the systems ofS1N International, DIALOG, NLM's TOXNET, 
and the Chemical Information System. Toxicology information was sought in the databases 
CCRIS (Chemical Carcinogenesis Research Information System), CHEMHAZIS (from the NTP 
Chemical Repository), EMIC, EMICBACK, GENETOX, RTECS (one record for each), and 
TOXLINE (name and CASRNs combined with terms for metabolism and the MESH heading for 
all neoplasms). Since that time, we have monitored 1200 life sciences journals for saccharin 
information using Current Contents on Diskette® (and cumulative issues on CD-ROM). We 
monitored not only for saccharin but also for information on rat bladder carcinogenesis induced 
by other chemicals and for articles by S. Cohen. We had requested and received many reprints 
on these topics by the time work resumed on this compound in 1997. 
Market information, including production, shipments, sales and consumption, labor use, 
and workers by type was sought in lAC PROMT and the FOODLINE files Food Science and 
Technology and International Food Market Data in March 1996. 
Regulatory information was sought in March 1996 from CHEMTOX and the 
FOODLINE file CURRENT FOOD LEGISLATION and more recently from the in-house FESA 
CD-ROM containing the latest Code ofFederal Regulations and the Federal Register pertaining 
to the title 21 (FDA) and title 40 (EPA) regulations.

CARCINOGENICITY 
There is sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of saccharin in experimental animals 
(!ARC V.22, 1980; IARC S.4, 1982; IARC S.7, 1987). Saccharin is produced commercially as 
calcium and sodium salts (6485-34-3 and 128-44-9, respectively) as well as the free acid, and the 
name saccharin has been applied to all these chemicals. When saccharin was administered in the diet 
or drinking water, increased incidences of lymphomas/leukemias and transitional cell carcinomas 
of the urinary bladder were seen in rats. In multi generation studies using rats, administration of 
saccharin in the diet induced transitional cell carcinomas and papillomas ofthe urinary bladder in 
the first generation male offspring. In one study when administered in the diet, saccharin induced 
papillary adenocarcinomas of the thyroid in mice. Several studies in which saccharin was 
administered orally to mice, rats, hamsters, and monkeys were considered inadequate for evaluation 
by IARC Working Groups. Surgical insertion of pellets containing saccharin resulted in urinary 
bladder cancer in mice and urinary bladder carcinomas in female mice. Other studies involving 
topical administration of saccharin to mice and intraperitoneal injection of female mice were 
considered to be inadequate for complete evaluation by IARC Working Groups. Transplacental 
exposure of rats to sodium saccharin and to saccharin did not produce any treatment-related 
neoplasms. Pretreatment with a single instillation in the urinary bladder ofa low dose ofN-methyl­
N-nitrosourea or feeding of N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl]formamide and subsequent oral 
administration of sodium saccharin for long periods increased the incidence of urinary bladder 
neoplasms in rats over that induced by the nitrosourea or the amide alone. Simultaneous 
administration of N-nitroso-N-( 4-hydroxybutyl)butylamine and sodium saccharin significantly 
enhanced the induction of urinary bladder papillomas over that seen after treatment with the 
nitrosamine alone. 
AnIARC Working Group reported that there is no adequate evidence for the carcinogenicity 
ofsaccharin in humans (!ARCS. 7, 1987). Since the positive report ofHowe et al. (1980), the results 
of seven case-control studies and one population study of urinary bladder cancer have been 
inconsistent. The largest was a population-based study in 10 areas ofthe United States. Significant 
trends of increasing risk with increasing average daily consumption were found in female 
nonsmokers and male heavy smokers. Subsequent, independent reanalysis of the same data by a 
different statistical technique (multiple logistic regression) confirmed the original findings overall 
but cast doubt on the significance ofthe findings in the two subgroups because ofinconsistent dose­
response trends, especially among the male heavy smokers. Three other case-control studies have 
also shown increased risks among subgroups, but other studies have given negative results. In 
another study ofpatients hospitalized for cancer and control patients, a greater proportion ofartificial 
sweetener users was found only among women with cancer ofthe stomach. Little information was 
available on urinary tract cancer. No overall association was found between artificial sweetener use 
and cancer. 
PROPERTIES 
Saccharin is a white crystalline powder with an intensely sweet taste. It is soluble in water, 
acetone, ethanol, and glycerol and slightly soluble in chloroform and diethyl ether. Saccharin is also 
available as the calcium and sodium salts. Calcium saccharin is a free-flowing white powder that 
is odorless or has a faint aromatic odor. Sodium saccharin occurs as white, nondusting granules with 
no odor. Both salts are soluble in water. When heated to decomposition, saccharin and its calcium 
and sodium salts emit toxic fumes of nitrogen oxides (NOJ and sulfur oxides (SOJ. Saccharin is 
REASONABLY ANTICIPATED TO BE A HUMAN CARCINOGEN III-905 EIGHTH REPORT ON CARCINOGENS Saccharin (Continued) 
available as a grade containing up to 98-1 01% active ingredients. Calcium saccharin is available as 
a grade 95% pure. Sodium saccharin is available as a grade 98-1 01% pure. 
USE 
Saccharin is used primarily as a nonnutritive sweetening agent, with usage increasing 
substantially after cyclamates were banned in food in 1970. In 197 6, the estimated U.S. consumption 
for all forms of saccharin was 45% in soft drinks; 18% in tabletop sweeteners; 14% in fruit juices, 
sweets, chewing gum, and jellies; 10% in cosmetics and oral hygiene products; 7% in drugs, such 
as coatings on pills; 2% in smokeless tobacco products; 2% in electroplating; and 2% for other uses 
(IARC V .22, 1980). 
PRODUCTION 
The USITC identified one U.S. producer for saccharin and its sodium salt from 1980 to 1988, 
but no production data were provided (USITC, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 
1989). The USITC also reported that one U.S. company produced saccharin, calcium salt, from 1982 
to 1984, but no production data were provided. U.S. imports of saccharin have steadily declined 
from 5.9 million lb in 1983 to 3. 7 million lb in 1984, about 1.8 million lb in 1985, and to 1.6 million 
lb in 1987 (USITCa, 1984; USDOC Imports, 1985 1986, 1988). The 1979 TSCA Inventory 
identified three U.S. companies producing 1.1 million lb of saccharin in 1977, and 6.3 million lb 
were imported. Two U.S. companies produced 1.6 million lb ofsaccharin, sodium salt, and 281,000 
lb were imported in 1977. Imports ofsaccharin, calcium salt, amounted to 5,500 lb, and one U.S. 
company produced 550,000 lb ofsaccharin, ammonium salt, in 1977 (TSCA, 1979). 
EXPOSURE 
The primary routes of potential human exposure to saccharin are ingestion and dermal 
contact. Potential exposure occurs through the consumption ofdietetic foods and drinks and some 
personal hygiene products, such as certain toothpastes and mouthwashes. The FDA has authorized 
the use ofsaccharin and its salts in beverages in concentrations not to exceed 12 mg/oz, as a sugar 
substitute not to exceed 20 mg for each expressed teaspoonful ofsugar sweetening equivalency, and 
in processed food not to exceed 30 mg per serving. In 1983, the Calorie Control Council estimated 
that in the United States, 44 million adults consumed saccharin-sweetened products. Saccharin 
consumption is greatest among diabetics and others whose medical conditions require the restriction 
ofcalories or carbohydrates. Exposure to saccharin has possibly decreased in recent years due to the 
introduction ofNutra-Sweet® and Equal® (aspartame). The risk ofpotential occupational exposure 
exists for workers involved in the production of saccharin or its salts, in the manufacture and 
formulation ofsaccharin-containing products, and during the packaging ofthe consumer products. 
The National Occupational Hazard Survey, conducted by NIOSH from 1972 to 1974, estimated that 
about 28,000 workers were potentially exposed to saccharin in the workplace (NIOSH, 1976). The 
National Occupational Exposure Survey ( 1981-1983) estimated that 12,994 total workers, including 
11,182 women, potentially were exposed to saccharin and 18,952 total workers, including 11,801 
women, potentially were exposed to its sodium salt (NIOSH, 1984). The Toxic Chemical Release 
Inventory (EPA) listed four industrial facilities that produced, processed or otherwise used saccharin 
in 1988 (TRI, 1990). In compliance with Community Right-to-Know Program, the facilities reported 
releases of saccharin to the environment which were estimated to total 750 lb. 
REASONABLY ANTICIPATED 1V BE A HUMAN CARCINOGEN 111-906 EIGHTH REPORT ON CARCINOGENS Saccharin (Continued) 
REGULATIONS 
The EPA regulates saccharin and its salts under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), 
and Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA). Saccharin is subject to reporting and 
recordkeeping rules under CERCLA, RCRA, and SARA. The EPA proposed raising the statutory 
reportable quantity (RQ) of 1 lb, established under CERCLA, to 100 lb for saccharin and its salts. 
The final rule adjusts the RQ from 1 lb to 100 lb. Saccharin is regulated as a hazardous constituent 
ofwaste under RCRA, and threshold amounts for facilities which may release saccharin have been 
established under SARA. The FDA regulates saccharin under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(FD&CA) as a food ingredient not to exceed specific concentrations. In compliance with the 
Delaney Clause, the FDA proposed to ban saccharin as a food additive in 1977 because of the 
available evidence ofits carcinogenicity in animals. However, final regulations are pending because 
ofcongressional action in 1977 requiring further study and labeling ofsaccharin. OSHA regulates 
saccharin under the Hazard Communication Standard and as a chemical hazard in laboratories.
