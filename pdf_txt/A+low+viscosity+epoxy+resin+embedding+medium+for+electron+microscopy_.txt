Spurr Low-Viscosity Embedding Media
For Biological, Material and Mineralogical Specimen
Background and Advantages
The introduction of Spurr1resin provided the microscopist with a resin of exceptional penetration qualities. Unlike the other epoxies
Spurr resin with a viscosity of 60 cps will readily penetrate membrane walls, hard tissue, rocks and other minerals. It has also been
used successfully in preparations of specimens with a high lipid content, tissues with hard, lignified walls, and highly vacuolatedparenchymatous tissue.

The Spurr resin is based on the four following components. ERL 4221, which because of its compact structure yields highlycross-linked polymers with good high temperature resistance.
The flexibilizer is the epoxy resin, D.E.R. 736, (diglycidyl ether of polypropylene glycol). This has a WPE value of 175-205.
The amount of D.E.R. 736 may be regulated to provide embedments with a variety of hardness characteristics. (see Table 1)
NSA, Nonenyl succinic anhydride is the hardener specially purified for EM usage. To avoid hydrolysis of epoxide or anhydride bond, werecommend minimum exposure of the above to atmospheric moisture. The accelerator is dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE). This agentgives longer pot life to the resin with a lighter color .Curing times can be shortened by increasing the accelerator ratios. (see Table 1)

Email: info@polysciences.de Preparation:
The medium is easily and rapidly prepared by weighing the components singly into a tared disposable plastic beaker. Exact weights
should be used for optimum performance. The DMAE should be added last after gently mixing other components. The complete
medium should now be mixed thoroughly by stirring. The resin mix should then be placed in a desiccator for storage duringspecimen dehydration and infiltration time.
The embedding medium should be freshly prepared, but it may be kept for convenience in measured aliquots. These are best stored
when sealed, and anhydrous, in a deep freeze without the DMAE.
Dehydration of biological and some mineral specimens is achieved by the usual graded series of dehydrating fluids. The medium is
compatible in all preparations with ethanol, methanol, acetone, tert-butyl alcohol, dioxane, hexylene glycol, isopropyl alcohol and
propylene oxide. T
o minimize lipid loss, use water and hexylene glycol at increasing concentrations or ascending concentrations of
10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 2 changes of 100% hexylene glycol. The dehydration process with hexylene
glycol has been used successfully by Spurr.
Use the complete medium for infiltration. Continuous mild agitation is desirable during the infiltration using a rotator or shaker .
Several variations of the infiltration procedure have been used. In some cases, the changeover from the dehydrating fluid to embedding
fluid is made in 3 stages, while in others additional intermediate steps are needed. With larger specimens, it is beneficial to infiltrate inthe afternoon and soak overnight in the embedding medium.
A rapid method useful for biopsies
3can be employed which requires only 2 hours to complete embedments. With mineral specimens,
alternate vacuum may help to speed impregnation. Embedding may be done with oven-dry gelatin capsules or Polysciences’ Flat
Embedding Molds. Specimens generally sink to the bottom of the liquid media. Blocks can be cured in 8 hours in a 70°C oven,
16 to 24 hours cures will not damage embedments. If modifications of cure are required, Table 1 provides suggestions.
Another embedding medium, which combines qualities of Poly/Bed®812 and Spurr’s mix was recommended.4This media consists
of a 1:1 mixture of Spurr’s resin and Poly/Bed®812 (Luft formula).5Spurr’ s resin has also been most recently used as an excellent
embedding media for immunohistochemical stains at the light microscopy level.10
Trimming and Polishing of Embedments:
The castings have good trimming, sectioning and polishing qualities. The block faces are hydrophobic and are not wetted easily by distilled
water during sectioning. Sections are tough under the electron beam and can be used without a supporting membrane on a 200 mesh grid.Mineral specimens can be easily polished on a lapping wheel. Castings are relatively inert and are resistant to KMnO
4or Ba(MnO4)2. No
noticeable effect of the electron transmission on the background plastic is observed with electron dense stains.
Grid staining for some tissues with uranyl acetate and lead citrate may require longer periods than usual or mild heat may be employedduring staining. En bloc with uranyl acetate is recommended.
The use of hydrogen peroxide to accelerate staining of Spurr sections,
6and Seligman Osmiophilic Stain Techniques7work 
satisfactory . Excellent staining for Light Microscopy has been obtained by the Azur II methylene blue method of Richardson et al.,8
and using Polysciences’ Multiple Stain.9
Handling Precautions:
The toxicological properties of the components of this unit are not fully known. Prolonged and repeated contact of liquid or breathing
of vapors or mists of the components used in this kit singly or collectively may cause delayed and serious injury. Do not get on skin,in eyes or on clothing. Avoid inhalation of vapors or mists. In case of contact with eyes, immediately flush with plenty of water for atleast 15 minutes; for eyes, get medical attention. In case of skin contact, wash with soap and water. Remove contaminated clothingand shoes at once. Wash thoroughly before re-use. Use only with adequate ventilation. Use of goggles and gloves are recommended.Page 2 of 3
