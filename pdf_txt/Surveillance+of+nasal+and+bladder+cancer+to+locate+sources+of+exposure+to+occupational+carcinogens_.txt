Abstract 
Objective -To locate sources of occupa - 
tional exposure to nasal and bladder 
carcinogens for surveillance follow up in 
British Columbia, Canada. 
Methods -Incident cases of nasal cancer 
(n=48), bladder cancer (n=105), and popu - 
lation based controls (n=159) matched for 
sex and age, were interviewed about their 
jobs, exposures, and smoking histories. 
Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for 57 
occupational groups with stratified exact 
methods to control for age, sex, and smok - 
ing. 
ResuZts-Occupational groups at in- 
creased risk of nasal cancer included: tex - 
tile workers (six cases, OR 7.6); miners, 
drillers, and blasters (six cases, OR 3.5); 
welders (two cases, OR 3.5); pulp and 
paper workers (three cases, OR 3.1); and 
plumbers and pipefitters (two cases, OR 
3.0). Nasal cancer ORs were not increased 
in occupations exposed to wood dust, pos- 
sibly due to low exposures in local wood 
industries. Strongly increased risks of 
bladder cancer were found for sheet metal 
workers (four cases, OR 5.3), miners (19 
cases, OR 4.9, gardeners (six cases, OR 
3.7), and hairdressers (three cases, OR 
3.2). Among occupations originally con- 
sidered at risk, the following had in - 
creased risks of bladder cancer: painters 
(four cases, OR 2.8); laundry workers (five 
cases, OR 2.3); chemical and petroleum 
workers (15 cases, OR 1.8); machinists 
(eight cases, OR 1.6); and textile workers 
(three cases, OR 1.5). 
ConcZusions-Occupational groups with 
increased risks and three or more cases 
with similar duties were selected for 
surveillance follow up. For nasal cancer, 
these included textile workers (five were 
garment makers) and pulp and paper 
workers (three performed maintenance 
tasks likely to entail stainless steel weld- 
ing). For bladder cancer, these included 
miners (12 worked underground), ma - 
chinists (five worked in traditional ma- 
chining), hairdressers (three had applied 
hair dyes), and laundry workers (three 
were drycleaners).

Keywords: textile industry; paper; wood; mining; occu- 
pational exposure Traditional disease surveillance has used vital 
statistics data bases to examine patterns of 
mortality in occupations and industries and 
generate hypotheses for further epidemiologi - 
cal study.’ Mer the definition by Rutstein et al? 
of occupational sentinel health events, many 
recent surveillance efforts have aimed to 
provide a more direct impetus to action, 
including treatment of patients, screening for 
disease in coworkers, and investigations into 
industrial hygiene at associated work sites.’ 
Few such studies have investigated cancer 
outcomes,4d although 13 cancers are listed as 
occupational sentinel health 
 events.2 There 
may be several reasons. 
Cancers have long induction and latent 
periods, so sources of exposure may no longer 
exist by the time the case is identified. 
Although this will often be true, recent studies 
of mesothelioma led to the discovery of 
previously unrecognised current sources of 
exposure to 
asbe~tos.~ This is especially impor - 
tant evidence of the potential value of cancer 
surveillance, as asbestos is one of the best 
known industrial hazards of this century. 
Sources of other carcinogens are likely to be 
less well recognised. 
Studies that followed the sentinel event 
approach of Rutsein et a1 have identified case 
series, then used case by case evaluations to 
assess the relation of a disease event to 
The ability to assess aetiology on an 
individual basis was a criterion for selecting 
diseases for the United States sentinel event 
notification system for occupational risks 
(SENSOR).’ For cancer, and most other 
diseases on the sentinel events list, it would be 
difficult to attribute cause on an individual 
basis, as most cancers with occupational 
aetiologies also occur in the absence of such 
exposures. Surveillance would require analyti - 
cal methods which compare groups. 
We conducted a surveillance study of three 
cancer types, mesothelioma, nasal cancer, and 
bladder cancer, with case -control 
methodology. It was designed to locate sources 
of occupational exposure to known or probable 
carcinogens in the province of British Colum - 
bia, Canada, with the aim of alerting regulatory 
agencies and industrial health professionals 
about occupations that warranted occupational 
hygiene exposure measurement, and control. 
This paper reports the results for nasal and 
bladder cancer, both of which have several 
known occupational aetiologies, as well as 
non-industrial aetiologies, in particular, smok - 
ing. The results for mesothelioma are reported 
elsewhere.’ Materials and methods 
All incident cases with histologically confirmed 
primary malignant tumours of the nasal cavity 
or sinuses (ICD-0 topography codes 160.0 
and 160.2 to 160.9), and urinary bladder 
(ICD-0 188) age 2 19 and registered by the 
British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) 
were considered eligible for the study. The reg- 
istry of the BCCA is population based and for 
case ascertainment uses reports from all 
provincial pathology and haematology labora - 
tories, death notices from the British Columbia 
Division of Vital Statistics, reports from other 
Canadian registries about cancers in residents 
of British Columbia, and admission records 
from BCCA clinics. A BCCA pathologist, not 
blinded to the initial diagnosis, reviewed tissue 
samples for every case initially identified as eli- 
gible. 
The study period was 1 September 1990 to 
31 August 1992 for nasal cancer, to allow 
accrual of about 50 cases, and 1 September 
1990 to 31 May 1991 for bladder cancer, suffi- 
cient for accrual of at least 100 cases. As people 
with an industrial background have often been 
found to develop bladder cancer at younger 
ages than those with other backgrounds: '" 
cases of bladder cancer were restricted to those 
born after 3 1 December 19 1 5. IDENTIFICATION OF CASES 
SELECTION OF CONTROLS 
Controls were randomly selected from five- 
year age and sex strata of the provincial voters 
list updated to 17 July 1991. Those eligible 
included all residents of British Columbia who 
were Canadian citizens aged 2 19 and who 
were not in prison or confined to a mental 
health institution by court order. Controls were 
frequency matched to the age and sex distribu - 
tion of cases of all three types of cancer 
included in the study. All study controls within 
two years of age of the cases were included in 
the analyses for each cancer site. 
INTERVIEWS 
The methods of contacting subjects in this 
study were reviewed and approved by the Uni- 
versity of British Columbia Behavioural Sci - 
ences Screening Committee. All subjects living 
within about six hours surface travel time of 
Vancouver (one way) were interviewed either in 
person or by telephone, at their convenience. 
The remaining interviews were conducted by 
telephone (21% for cases and 23% for 
controls). 
If a subject did not speak English well or had 
trouble recalling events in his or her life, a rela- 
tive chosen by the subject was asked to 
translate or help with the interview. If the sub - 
ject was dead, the surviving next of kin who had 
most recently lived with the subject was 
contacted for interview. An attempt was made 
to frequency match next of kin control 
interviews to the number of next of kin case 
interviews within age-sex strata. However, 
when no next of kin was available or the request 
for a next of kin interview would have resulted 
in a refusal, the interview was conducted with 
the control instead. Interviews were conducted with a standard- 
ised questionnaire based on a prototype 
originally developed by the United States 
National Cancer Institute to investigate occu- 
pational associations with mesothelioma.'' It 
included occupational, residential, smoking, 
and medical histories, and an exposure history 
aimed at identifying exposures considered by 
the International Agency for Research on Can- 
cer 
(IARC)'z-'6 to be known or probably carci- 
nogenic. Interviews were conducted with a 
standardised questionnaire. For this study, 
questions about specific exposures and work 
processes relating to nasal and bladder cancer 
were added. An interview guide was used to aid 
recall of exposure; it listed types and trade 
names of products in which carcinogens were 
used. Data for the interview guide was 
obtained from the Canadian Centre for Occu - 
pational Health and Safety trade names data 
base, the Canadian Pharmaceutical Society, 
Health and Welfare Canada, and texts." 
All interviews were conducted by a regis- 
tered nurse who was aware of the case-control 
status of the subjects, but was not aware of 
aetiologies for the specific cancer sites. All 
interviews were reviewed for completeness by 
an industrial hygienist (KT) who was not aware 
of the case-control status of the subjects. Addi- 
tional information requested by the hygienist 
(missing data, or further information to clarify 
tasks or exposures) was sought by the inter- 
viewer. 
OCCUPATIONAL GROUPS 
All occupations and industries listed were 
coded to the fourth digit of the standard occu- 
pational and industrial classifi~ation.'~ 
 'O In 
total, 3951 separate jobs were listed by the 
interviewees, representing over 300 occupa - 
tional and 500 industrial codes. For analysis, 
grouping of jobs was necessary. However, 
collapsing to the third or second digit of the 
standard classifications was likely to group 
people with very different exposures (all 
construction trades together, production and 
management employees together within an 
industry), who might be kept separate in a 
grouping scheme specific to the study. 
Such a scheme was therefore developed 
without knowledge of the case or control status 
of the people whose jobs were being grouped. 
When occupation was considered most likely 
to determine exposures, it was used as the basis 
for assignment to a group (managers, teachers, 
truck drivers), and when the industry was 
judged more likely to determine exposures, 
such as production and labouring jobs, it was 
used to assign groups (sawmill workers, railway 
transport workers). Where both industry and 
occupation would be expected to determine 
potential exposures (industrial mechanics, 
welders, and other tradespeople), occupation 
was used as the basis for classification. 
After the initial assignment to occupational 
groups, the descriptions of duties and expo- 
sures accompanying each job listing were 
reviewed to ensure the best possible 
classification -for example, a retail store 
"manager " who stocked shelves and acted as a 1

cashier was grouped with sales clerks instead of 
managers; a motor body shop worker who 
painted cars was grouped with painters, rather 
than service station attendants or vehicle 
mechanics. Finally, occupational groups with 
c 20 listings were reviewed to find whether 
they could be combined with others. In a few 
instances, this was not considered possible 
(hairdressers and barbers, laundry personnel, 
firefighters). In the final classification, all job 
listings were assigned to one of 57 occupational 
groups (table 2). 
CASE -CONTROL ANALYSIS 
Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (95% CIS) were calculated for “ever” 
(defined as six months of employment or 
longer) versus “never” employed in each occu - 
pational group. Latency analyses were con - 
ducted for all occupational groups, with the 
most recent 20 years of employment removed. 
Odds ratios were also calculated for 5, 10, and 
15 year latencies for all occupational groups 
which were originally suspected or which had 
ORs of 32.0 in the initial ever or never analy- 
ses. Effect estimates were also calculated for 
two duration of employment categories: 6 
months to < 10 years; and 
2 10 years. These 
are reported when they influence the 
interpretation of the results. 
All OR estimates were adjusted for sex, age 
(in three strata: c 60; 60 to 69; and 
3 70), and cigarette smoking. Strata for smok - 
ing were based on associations within this 
dataset for each cancer site, resulting in two 
strata for nasal cancer (0-19; and 220 
pack-years), and three strata for bladder cancer 
(0-9; 10-39; and 240 pack-years). Sex-specific 
analyses (men only) were conducted for ever 
versus never employed in each occupational 
group. When these showed notable differences 
compared with the sex adjusted analyses, 
further investigations were carried out. 
Because of the small size of some occupa - 
tional groups, exact methods were used to 
summarise ORs across all strata and calculate 
95% 
  CIS.^' 
 *’ All summary ORs and 95% CIS 
were calculated with Egret (Statistics and Epi- 
demiology Research Corporation, Seattle, WA, 
1993). 
__

The ORs and 95% CIS were also calculated 
for occupational exposures to specific agents 
and processes, and for other factors-for 
example, diseases, or drugs-considered to be 
possibly related to nasal and bladder cancer. 
When non -occupational factors originally sus- 
pected were shown to be positively associated, 
unconditional logistic regression was used to 
find whether effect estimates for occupational 
groups with increased relative risks remained 
the same after adjustment for these additional 
potential confounders. 
SELECTION OF OCCUPATIONS FOR SURVEILLANCE 
FOLLOW UP 
A standard framework was used to select which 
occupations were of interest for surveillance 
follow up. An occupational group was desig - 
nated for notification of occupational health 
personnel if (a) it had an OR of 
> 3.0 in the 
ever employed analysis, or an OR 
 > 1.2 if it was 
originally considered to be at risk based on a 
literature review, and (b) at least three cases in 
the occupational group had a pattern of similar 
job duties or exposures. Before notification of 
local regulatory agencies and hygienists, con - 
sideration was given to whether the designated 
jobs were already recognised as associated with 
cancer in British Columbia. As this final selec - 
tion process was mainly of local interest, it is 
not described in detail here. 
Results 
There were six cases of nasal cancer and 18 
cases of bladder cancer initially reported by the 
BCCA that were found on pathology review 
not to be eligible for the present analysis. Table 
1 indicates the response rates of those consid - 
ered eligible for the study after pathology 
review. Information was obtained for 
80%-90% of both cases and controls, and in 
most instances from the subjects themselves. 
Table 1 also indicates selected descriptive 
characteristics of the interviewed subjects. 
Because the cases of bladder cancer and 
controls were restricted to those born after 
191 5,22 of the controls selected for the overall 
study were not eligible for the bladder cancer 
analysis. The mean ages among cases were 
similar to controls. There were differences in 
sex distribution between the cases of nasal can- 
cer and controls, because the frequency 
matching of controls to cases was based on the 
distribution for all three cancer sites combined 
and nasal cancer had a higher proportion of 
female cases than did mesothelioma or bladder 
cancer. COMPARABILITY OF CASES AND CONTROLS 
NASAL CANCER 
Table 2 shows the ORs and 95% CIS of 
associations between the 57 occupational 
groups and cancers of the nasal cavity and 
sinuses. Textile workers had a significantly 
increased risk in the ever employed analysis. 
Only one exposed case and two exposed 
controls were men. Sex specific analyses gave 
ORs of 3.5 (95% CI 0.1 to 89.3) for men and 
12.9 (95% CI 1.3 to 663) for women ever 
employed. All five female cases and the one Table 2

* Adjusted for sex, age (in 3 strata: 
 < 60,60-69, and Z 70 years), and cigarette smoking (in two strata: 0-19 and 
2 20 pa&-years). t All exposed cases and controls were men. - No cases, no further analyses done. nec = Not elsewhere classified 
female control were employed in garment 
making. Men in this group had varying jobs, 
none in garment making. Most of the cases 
mentioned exposure to fabric dust, and some 
remarked on the fabric finish, cleaning sol- 
vents, and sewing machine oil. None of the 
textile worker cases had been employed in 
other occupations found to be at risk in this 
study or considered beforehand to be at risk. 
Four of the cases and none of the controls were 
non-smokers. 
Risk estimates 23.0 were measured in four 
other occupational groups in the ever em- 
ployed analysis: pulp and paper mill workers; 
miners, drillers, and blasters; welders; and 
plumbers and pipefitters. All exposed cases and controls in these occupations were men. For all 
except the pulp and paper mill group, risks 
increased with 
2 10 years of employment. 
An examination of job duties among these 
occupational groups showed an interesting 
pattern related to pulp mill employment. 
Among the welders, one case had worked in 
pulp and paper mill construction. Many pulp 
mill piping systems are stainless steel, and 
welding this metal produces fumes containing 
nickel and hexavalent 
 chromium.19 Two other 
cases may have had similar exposures: a pulp 
mill pipefitter (included in both the plumber- 
pipefitter and pulp-paper mill worker occupa - 
tional groups), and a pulp mill instrument fitter 
(in the pulp and paper mill group). The - 
Surveillance of nasal and bladder cancer to locate sources of exposure to occupational carcinogens 447 
remaining case who had worked at a pulp mill 
had no specific job details given, because the 
interviewee was a next of kin. All of the pulp 
and paper mill worker controls were involved in 
production rather than maintenance job:, and 
none of the welder or plumber -pipefitter 
controls reported working in pulp and paper 
mills or other industries likely to involve stain- 
less steel welding. 
The cases in the miners, drillers, and blasters 
group had widely varying work descriptions, 
which did not suggest exposures in common. 
Two worked underground and four above 
ground. 
Among occupational categories originally 
considered suspect, those involving work with 
wood or leather had ORs consistently <1.0: 
sawmill workers; forestry and logging workers; 
carpenters and woodworkers; and shoe and 
leather workers. Consistent with the results 
obtained in the analysis of these occupational 
groups, ORs were <1 .O for occupational expo- 
sures to the following agents and processes 
which have been strongly associated with nasal 
cancer in other studies: hardwood dust (OR 
0.6, 95% CI 0.1 to 3.0); softwood dust (OR 
0.7, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.6); furniture or cabinet 
making (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.1 to 3.8); boot or 
shoe manufacture or repair (no cases); and 
leather tanning or processing (no cases). 
Chemical and biological laboratory personnel 
were also not at increased risk of nasal cancer. 
Smelter and foundry workers, who might 
have been exposed to nickel or chromium, 
showed slightly increased risks only with a 20 
year latency period taken into account. Paint - 
ers had increased risks that increased with 
latency. Machinists also had raised risks that 
increased with both duration of exposure and 
latency. No pattern of duties or exposures was 
found within any of the occupational groups 
originally suspected of being at high risk. 
The histologies of the nasal cancers in this 
study included 23 squamous cell carcinomas, 
seven melanomas, seven lymphomas, two 
adenocarcinomas, two adenoid cystic carcino - 
mas, and seven other histologies with one case 
each. A histology specific analysis was judged 
possible only for squamous cell carcinoma 
(n=23). One control who was more than two 
years older than the remaining cases was 
excluded from the reanalysis (n= 158). The fol- 
lowing occupational groups had ORs 23.0 in 
the ever employed analysis: textile workers (OR 
5.3, 95% CI 0.2 to 107); sheet metal workers 
(OR 5.3,95% CI 0.1 to 470); machinists (OR 
4.3, 95% CI 0.6 to 29.2); railway transport 
workers not elsewhere classified (OR 4.2, 95% 
CI 0.6 to 26.7); hairdressers and barbers (OR 
4.1, 95% CI 0 to 502); and welders (OR 3.1, 
95% CI 0 to 267). Only the railway workers 
and machinists had at least three cases, but no 
pattern of duties or exposures was found within 
these occupational groups. All of the occupa - 
tional groups that had ORs >3.0 in the analysis 
of all histologies had decreased risks for those 
ever employed in this analysis, indicating that 
the risks were not specific to squamous cell 
carcinoma. All the remaining occupational 
groups originally suspected of being at high risk had ORs 
c 1 .0 in this analysis. There were 
no pulp and paper mill workers or painters with 
this histology. 
Adjustment for nasal polyps and decongest - 
ant use did not change the results sufficiently to 
alter the interpretation of the occupational 
analyses. 
BLADDER CANCER 
Table 3 shows the associations between occu - 
pation and bladder cancer. Plumbers and pipe- 
fitters had an infinite relative risk, based on 
only one case. Sheetmetal workers had an OR 
of 5.4. Two of the four sheetmetal worker cases 
(but not the control) had worked in aircraft 
assembly, a job which has been reported to 
have exposure to carcinogenic aromatic 
amines.?’ 
Miners, drillers, and blasters had an OR of 
4.5 in the ever employed analysis. The relative 
risk estimate increased with duration of 
employment (3 10 years, OR 8.1). All but one 
case in this occupational group were men. 
Twelve cases and four controls mined under - 
ground where diesel exhaust fumes and oil mist 
exposures are often high. The most commonly 
named types of mines were gold (six cases, 
three controls), nickel (four cases, one control), 
and coal (three cases, one control). 
Strongly increased ORs were measured in 
two other occupational groups in the ever 
employed analyses: hairdressers and barbers; 
and gardeners. All three cases in the hairdress - 
ers and barbers group recalled applying hair 
dyes. The control, who was a barber, did not. 
Gardeners had increased risk with increased 
duration of employment (2 10 years, OR infin- 
ity). There was no pattern of duties or 
exposures in this occupational group. 
Among occupations shown to have increased 
risks in other studies, several had increased 
ORs in the ever employed analysis: painters; 
laundry personnel; chemical and petroleum 
workers; machinists; and textile workers. Ex- 
cept for the chemical workers, all of these had 
increased risks with 
 2 10 years of exposure. 
Only laundry workers and machinists showed 
consistent patterns of duties or exposures. 
Three of the laundry worker cases worked in 
dry cleaning, versus one control. Five machin - 
ist cases and three controls worked in 
traditional machine shops, doing metal grind - 
ing, drilling, and lathe work. All reported using 
cutting oils. 
There were also some occupational groups, 
considered potentially at risk based on evi- 
dence from other studies, which did not have 
increased ORs in the ever employed analysis: 
smelter and foundry workers; motor vehicle 
operators; cooks; vehicle mechanics; and shoe 
and leather workers. 
Sex specific analyses did not show any 
important differences from the sex adjusted 
analyses. 
The cases of bladder cancer had the follow - 
ing histologies: 55 transitional cell carcinomas; 
43 papillary transitional cell carcinomas; four 
squamous cell carcinomas; one adenocarci - 
noma; one colloid carcinoma; and one carci- 
noma not otherwise specified. As the papillary, Table 3

Discussion 
Increased risks have been measured in textile 
workers 
 elsewhere.2cz8 The specific exposure of 
interest is not known, although fabric dust has NASAL CANCER been considered a 
 possibility.25 Certain fibres 
are made from plant materials (cotton, linen, 
rayon), and may produce exposures similar to 
furniture workers and cabinet makers. Another 
similarity is the potential for concurrent expo- 
sure to formaldehyde. This chemical is used in 
permanent press applications and is considered 
probably carcinogenic by LARC.” Sewing 
machine oils may also be a carcinogenic 
exposure. 
Among four cases who had worked in the 
pulp and paper industry, three were known to 
have been maintenance workers and were likely 
to have welded or brazed stainless steel. Expo- 
sures to nickel and hexavalent chromium are 
likely in these operations; these metals have Surveillance of nasal and bladder cancer to locate sources of exposure to occupational carcinogens 449 
I been consistently associated with increased 
risks of nasal cancer and are considered to be 
known 
 carcinogens.I6 Cohort studies of pulp 
and paper mill workers in the United States 
and Finland have not found nasal cancers, 
although these cohorts and the expected 
number of cases of nasal cancer (based on 
population rates) were quite 
 small.29 
 31 
Although exposures to chromium, nickel, 
and formaldehyde were queried in the expo- 
sure section of the questionnaire, they were not 
recalled by the pulp and paper maintenance 
worker or the textile worker cases. This is likely 
to be because these agents are constituents of 
composite materials and therefore not known 
to employees who are

We found no associations with occupations 
exposed to wood dust or wood, in contrast to 
reported results.” The woods used in this 
region are almost exclusively 
 SoftWOods, which 
have been associated with increased risks of 
squamous cell carcinomas of the nose and

Earlier studies conducted in British Columbia 
and nearby Washington State accrued cases 
from 1939 to 1977 and 1979 to 1987 
re~pectively.~~ 
 ” The different result found in 
this study may reflect evidence that more 
recent exposures are relatively low (means <1 
mg/m3) in the major wood industries of this 
region (construction carpentry and production

No associations were found with other occu- 
pational groups originally suspected of being at 
high risk. Increased risks of nasal cancer have 
been found elsewhere among nickel refining 
workersI6; however, the smelters and foundries 
in British Columbia are not involved in nickel 
refining or alloy production. Chemical and 
biological laboratory personnel may have 
exposures to 
f0rrna1dehyde.I~ Although the OR 
estimate for the occupational group was not 
increased, both laboratory workers with nasal 
cancer reported this exposure, whereas half the 
controls did not. Boot and shoe manufacture 
and repair have been classified by LWC” as 
carcinogenic to humans. The lack of associ - 
ation in this study may reflect the fact that shoe 
and leather work are not usual occupations in 
British Columbia; only one of the controls had 
this occupation in this province.

Diesel equipment is commonly used in above

drilling equipment with cutting oils (Tom

designated as known human

previously in the epidemiological literature as 
being associated with bladder cancer:

Painters use 
various pigments, extenders, and solvents; this 
job has been classified as carcinogenic to

Tailors and textile workers may also have expo- 
sure to pigments and dyes. Several occupations 
with exposures to inks, aromatic amines, poly- 
cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and coal tars 
were included in the occupational group 
chemical and petroleum workers: printers, hot 
tar roofers, rubber processors, coal workers,

have been found for aluminum production; the 
process has been classified by IARC as 
carcinogenic to humans.” The group smelter 
and foundry workers included one case and 
three controls who had worked at an aluminum 
smelter. The lack of an association in this study 
may be related to the case definition (see limi- 
tations). 
Motor vehicle operators have often had 
increased risks of bladder cancer reported, 
although relative risks have generally been

the lack of association for shoe and leather 
workers may simply reflect the paucity of 
leather working occupations within British 
Columbia.

LIMITATIONS 
The main limitation of this study was its small 
size, resulting in imprecise OR estimates. 
Looking for patterns of duties or exposures 
among at least three cases in an occupational 
group, as well as increased relative risks, acted 
as a check for selecting occupations of interest 
for surveillance follow up. 
Grouping of jobs meant that people with dif- 
ferent work duties and exposures were in- 
cluded in the same occupational group, usually 
expected to result in non-differential misclassi- 
fication and bias of risk estimates to the 
null.57 
This may have been a special issue for trades 
occupations the exposures of which would also 
be influenced by their industry of employment. 
As a check, we looked for patterns of exposure 
among occupations with increased ORs, and if 
they suggested an industry of interest, all the 
job listings for that industrial code were exam - 
ined descriptively. 
This study excluded carcinomas in situ. The 
natural history of many bladder cancers may 
include a prolonged period (years) of transi - 
tional cell carcinoma in situ before develop - 
ment of invasive carcinoma. Difficulty in 
classifying a tumour as invasive or in situ was 
responsible for most of the changes in histo- 
logical eligibility of bladder cancer in this 
study. Some epidemiologists have recom - 
mended that in situ carcinomas be included in 
case definitions'' 
 51; however, comparisons of 
occupational associations with invasive and in 
situ cancers in the United States national blad- 
der cancer study indicated that risks were very 
similar.58 Therefore exclusion of in situ tu- 
mours should not bias results, except when at 
risk occupational groups are screened to allow 
early detection. This may have been the case 
for aluminum smelter workers in British 
Columbia, who were made aware of their risk 
in a recent cohort study." 
SURVEILLANCE FOLLOW UP 
Results from these studies were used to select 
occupations which warranted follow up investi - 
gations in British Columbia work sites. Two 
occupational groups with increased risks of 
nasal cancer and three or more cases with simi- 
lar duties or exposures were selected: textile 
workers (suspect exposures: formaldehyde, 
oils, fabric dust); and pulp and paper workers (suspect exposures: chromium and nickel from 
stainless steel welding or brazing in mainten - 
ance jobs). These jobs were held by 10 cases, 
representing 21 % of the cases of nasal cancer. 
None had been recognised previously in 
compensation claims or penalty actions by the 
local regulatory agency despite evidence link - 
ing the job or its exposures to nasal cancer in 
the scientific literature. 
Four occupations had increased risks of 
bladder cancer and showed shared patterns of 
job duties or exposures among three or more 
cases: mining (suspect exposures: diesel ex- 
haust and oil mist); machining (suspect expo- 
sures: polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons and 
aromatic amines in cutting oils); hairdressing 
(suspect exposures: hair dyes as well as coal tar 
derivatives and oils); and drycleaning (suspect 
exposures: volatile chlorinated aliphatic hydro - 
carbons). These jobs were held by 33 cases, 
representing 31% of the cases of bladder 
cancer. Two of these occupations had not been 
previously recognised by the local regulatory 
agencies, in either penalty actions or compen - 
sation claims: hairdressers, and machinists. 
The value of disease surveillance in this 
study will only be known after workplace follow 
up determines whether exposures to carcino - 
gens continue in the targeted occupations. The 
responsible British Columbia regulatory agen- 
cies, as well as occupational hygienists in the 
pulp and paper industry have been informed of 
the study results to target exposure measure - 
ments and control strategies. Some of the 
targeted occupations are found in small shops 
which are unlikely to employ professional 
health and safety personnel. Without attention 
from regulatory agencies, exposures to carcino - 
gens in these work sites are unlikely to be rec- 
ognised.
