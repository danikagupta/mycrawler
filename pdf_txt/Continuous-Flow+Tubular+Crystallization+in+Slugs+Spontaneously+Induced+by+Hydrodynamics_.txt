ABSTRACT: A novel continuous crystallizer design is described with the
potential to provide improved control of crystal properties, improved processreproducibility, and reduced scale-up risk. Liquid and gas are introduced intoone end of the tube at ﬂow rates selected to spontaneously generate alternating
slugs of liquid and gas that remain stable while cooling crystallization occurs ineach liquid slug. Mixing within each stable self-circulating slug is maximized bycontrolling the slug aspect ratio through speci ﬁcation of liquid and gas ﬂow
rates. The crystallizer is designed so that nucleation and growth processes aredecoupled to enhance the individual control of each phenomenon. Coaxial orradial mixers combine liquid streams to generate seed crystals immediately
upstream of the growth zone where nucleation is minimized, and crystal
growth is controlled by the varying temperature pro ﬁle along the length of the
tube. The slug- ﬂow crystallizer design is experimentally demonstrated to
generate large uniform crystals of
L-asparagine monohydrate in less than 5 min.
1. INTRODUCTION
Compared to batch and semibatch crystallizers, continuous- ﬂow
crystallizers have the potential for higher reproducibility, processeﬃciency, and ﬂexibility, as well as lower capital and production
cost.1−8Many continuous- ﬂow crystallizer designs have been
proposed in recent years with the goals of improving
pharmaceutical processing or c ontrol of crystal product pro-
perties. For example, a continuous oscillatory ba ﬄed crystallizer
has been proposed that employs a piston to agitate the crystalslurry in a long pipe with ba ﬄes.2Such a crystallizer can typically
operate at lower shear rates than a single stirred-tank crystallizer
but is limited to lower solids densities and e ﬀective viscosities and
has limited degrees of freedom for feedback control. An alternativedesign that employed laminar ﬂow through a tube was
demonstrated for paracetamol crystallization, but it was warned
that inducing crystallization in a continuous slurry undergoing
laminar ﬂow in a tube by cooling through its walls was very prone
to clogging for some solute −solvent systems.6With the notion
that the best control of crystal size distribution should be obtained
in a continuous- ﬂow design that has negligible back-mixing with a
residence time distribution approaching that of an ideal plug- ﬂow
crystallizer, several designs have tried to generate plug ﬂow-like
conditions. One continuous crystallizer design consists of slurryﬂowing through a tube with Kenics-type static mixers through its
length to induce a more uniform velocity pro ﬁle, with improved
controllability obtained by introducing antisolvent at multiplepoints along the tube length.
1A tubular crystallizer less prone to
clogging ensured plug- ﬂow behavior by forcibly segmenting theﬂow into liquid slugs separated by an immiscible ﬂuid.3−5,9
Because of recirculation, the slurry in each slug is mixed even in
the absence of any static mixer.10,11However, the separation of
immiscible solvent takes additional process time when multipleliquids are used, and the slug production devices, usually with
more than three channels, were relatively complicated. A
signiﬁcant advantage of all of these continuous- ﬂow crystallizer
designs is the lack of a stirring blade, resulting in negligible attrition
compared to the mixed-suspension mixed-product-removal
crystallizers widely employed for inorganic crystallization.12
Most existing continuous- ﬂow crystallizers are not speci ﬁcally
designed to provide many degrees of freedom for the control ofcrystal shape and size distribution in the presence of process
disturbances and variations in crystallization kinetics associated
with changes in contaminant pro ﬁle of the feed streams. An
improved continuous- ﬂow crystallizer design would minimize
operational problems while retaining the advantages of the
best previous continuous crystallizers. At same time, there are
advantages to continuous- ﬂow designs that enable the direct
application of best-practices operations developed for the optimalcontrol of batch and semibatch crystallization.
Toward these goals, this paper describes the design and
implementation of a slug- ﬂow crystallizer in which a multiphase
mixture of liquid and gas in a tube spontaneously separates into

ﬂow crystallizer has all the advantages of a segmented- ﬂow
crystallizer but does not require any specialized equipmentto induce slug formation and avoids the use of liquid/liquidseparators. In the proposed design, hydrodynamically stable slugsform spontaneously immediately upon the contact of the liquid/
slurry and the gas. This paper demonstrates the crystallizerdesign for a cooling crystallization, which is inherently morechallenging than antisolvent crystallization due to the latter ’s
easier nucleation to generate seed crystals.
Figure 1. Schematic of slug- ﬂow cooling crystallization. Crystal nucleation is induced by combining hot and cold LAM-aqueous solutions
(photographs in Figure 2). Slug formation spontaneously occurred by combining LAM slurry and air streams (Figure 3a). Crystal growth occurs in
the slurry in each slug going through the tube for a speci ﬁed residence time (Figure 3b).

dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg401715e |Cryst. Growth Des. 2014, 14, 851 −860 8522. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS AND EQUIPMENT SETUP
For better control of product crystal size distribution (CSD), the
cooling crystallization process is decoupled into three parts: crystal
nucleation, slug formation, and crystal growth (Figure 1). Nuclei were
generated within laminar ﬂow by direct cooling, or within a coaxial or
radial jet mixer by mixing hot and cold solutions. The slurry streamcontaining nuclei acting as seed crystals are combined with an air
stream at ﬂow rates selected to spontaneously form stable slugs. The
motion of the slug through the tube mixes the solution withoutrequiring any of the stirring blades that cause attrition in mixed-tankcrystallizers. With each slug going through the tube with the same
residence time, and with no stirring blades to cause attrition, the
crystals in the slugs would be expected to grow to a large uniform size.The following experimental methods and equipment setup wereselected to demonstrate the feasibility of this process design.
The solute is
L-asparagine monohydrate (LAM, purity ≥99%
(TLC), from Sigma Aldrich), and the solvent is deionized (DI) water,
which were selected because this solute −solvent combination is a
well-studied model system that is challenging due to the very strongtendency of LAM crystals (product form, Figure A1, SupportingInformation) to aggregate in this solvent.

2.1. Nuclei Generation. In a preliminary experiment, a high solids
amount (high initial concentration, 0.16 g of LAM/g of DI, as shown
in Table 1) in each slug was used to demonstrate slug stability and
CSD improvement in the growth stage. In another preliminary experi-
ment, a low solids amount (low initial concentration, 0.09 g of LAM/g
of DI, as shown in Table 1) was applied to facilitate in-line and o ﬀ-line
imaging and to compare the nucleation obtained from coaxial and
radial mixers, to identify the most promising mixer type for subsequentexperiments.The nucleation experimental conditions are listed in Table 1.
For the radial mixing experiment (LAM nuclei were generated by
combining hot and cold saturation solutions (66 °C, 0.16 g of LAM/g
of DI; and 22 °C, 0.02 g of LAM/g of DI, respectively) through
a coaxial or radial jet mixer (Figure 2b,c). This approach, ﬁrst
demonstrated in ref 20, contrasts with other continuous tubular
cooling crystallizations that require a separate batch crystallizer to pro-
duce seed crystals to feed into the continuous crystallizer. Peristalticpumps enable simple operation of tubing at high temperature, whilea syringe pump provides smooth ﬂow rates. A peristaltic pump
(Master ﬂex pump drive 7521-40, Easy Load II pump head with model
#77200-50) and a silicone tube (Master ﬂex BioPharm Plus platinum-
cured silicone tubing, 3.1 mm inner diameter) were used to transferhot solution to the mixer at a rate of about 3.7 mL/min. The tubingchoice was based on the following criteria: low extractable andspallation, high temperature en durance, surface hydrophobicity
(a more convex water slug shape is obtained by using a more hydro-
phobic surface),
21and long life of the pump tubing. Around the pump
head, a silicone tube with smaller inner diameter (2 mm) was usedto increase the pump rotation rate for the same ﬂow rate, to reduce
the amplitude of ﬂow pulsations. A syringe pump (model NE-4000,
from New Era Pump Systems, Inc.) was used to transfer cold solution
to the mixer at a rate of 3.3 mL/min. The operational details of theother experiments in Table 1 are similar to the radial mixingexperiment but with the di ﬀerent values given in the associated column
of the table.
2.2. Slug Generation. A key element in the proposed crystallizer
design is to exploit the hydrodynamically stable spontaneousgeneration of slugs. Many hydrodynamically stable ﬂow regimes can
occur when a liquid and gas are combined in a tube, as shown in
Figure 3,
15,16,22with the stability of the ﬂow regimes determined by
the ranges of inlet gas and liquid ﬂow rates, tubing diameter, and ﬂuids
properties. For crystallization from liquid solution, most of the ﬂow
regimes have relatively poor spatial mixing of the liquid and allow
liquid solution to remain close to the tube walls for long periods oftime, which would encourage crystallization on the surface of the innerTable 1. Main Experimental Conditions for Cooling

estimated from the mass ﬂow rate and temperature measured right
before or after the experiment. The average velocities are calculated
from the volumetric ﬂow rates and mixer inner diameters.

(white color) and liquid (blue color) mixture in a horizontal round

The air and liquid in slug ﬂow can swap places depending on the
aﬃnity of the liquid for the material on the inner surface of the tube;
for example, a water slug with a strongly hydrophobic surface wouldappear as shown, with convex/roundish water slugs moving through
the tube. For a strongly hydrophilic surface with water as the liquid,
the air slugs would be convex. Regardless of surface a ﬃnities, the slugs
become asymmetric at su ﬃciently high velocities, as observed in
Figure 10.Crystal Growth & Design Article
dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg401715e |Cryst. Growth Des. 2014, 14, 851 −860 853tube (aka fouling), eventually clogging the tube. In contrast, slug
ﬂow has an internal circulation of liquid11(see video in Supporting
Information) that limits the time that liquid stays close to the tubewall, which results in the ﬂuid dynamics within each slug operating like
a small well-mixed crystallizer, with limited fouling.
Figure 4a shows an experimental demonstration of the spontaneous
formation of hydrodynamically stable slugs after streams of slurry and
air are passed through two branches of a T mixer that had a similar
inner diameter as the tubes. Stable slugs were maintained throughoutcrystallization within each slug as it transports through the tubing to its
exit. Air was transferred to the mixer through the same peristaltic pump
with dual pump heads, with ﬂow oscillation suppressed by o ﬀsetting
their rollers, and a silicone tube with ﬁlters (pore sizes 3 and 0.2 μm) to
prevent dust particles from getting into the tubes at the pump heads,and from contacting slurry at the mixer, respectively. Within a large
hydrodynamically stable regime
16for slugs in a 3.1 mm (inner
diameter) tube, the length ratio of liquid and gas slugs was adjustable byspecifying the ﬂow rates (or pump rotation rates) between slurry and
air. A pump rpm ratio of 1:1 between hot solution and air was used
to generate stable liquid slugs of similar sizes with all aspect ratios of
about 1 (Figure 5a,b). A horizontal wrapping of tubing around a bucket
produced hydrodynamically stable slugs with no combination orpartitioning (Figures 4b and 5a,c).2.3. Crystal Growth. The growth experimental conditions were
reported in Table 2. Again the radial mixing experiment was used tojustify the optimized design. The residence time after slug formation
was on the order of 5 min (to prevent generation of a large amount of
waste materials) in 15.2 m of transparent hydrophobic silicone tube
(Dow Corning Pharma-80 tubing, 3.1 mm inner diameter). While the
slugs were moving inside the silicone tube toward the exit, videos ofthem were recorded under an in-line trinocular stereomicroscope
(microscope model #XV331AC20C, from Cyber Scienti ﬁc Corp.;
camera model #DFK 22BUC03, from The Imaging Source, LLC) at
1 m before the exit. After the slurry slugs exited the end of tube, they
were collected one by one into polystyrene wells (1.5 cm diameter,
with the aqueous slugs covered with corn oil after collection to
suppress evaporation) for o ﬀ-line imaging under the stereomicroscope.
Crystallizations are generally more poorly mixed for higher solids
densities. Since each slug operates as a small well-mixed batch

shades at water/air interfaces. At higher ﬂow rates, the shape of the
water slug would be dominated by the velocity (e.g., the drag from
wall) rather than the hydrophobicity of the tubing material. (c)

in which case a ﬁnes dissolution step can be inserted into the crystal
growth stage to enlarge the ﬁnal product crystals and reduce aggregation.
The end stage of the preliminary experiment had ﬁnes dissolution
implemented as a fast heating of the slurry slugs to 50 °C, followed by
going through 2 m of tubing in each of the two temperature baths at
39 and 22 °C, respectively, and then to room temperature (Figure 6).
The temperature in each bath was held constant using peristaltic pumps
(same model as before) and hot and cold water reservoirs (Figure 6),
controlled with Proportional-Integral controller tuned as in past
studies.23The temperature baths were not used in experiments with
coaxial and radial mixing, as the product crystals from those experiments
were uniformly large without ﬁnes dissolution.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Below are results and discussion from the experimental
demonstrations of the slug- ﬂow crystallizer that include (1) a
nonmonotonic spatial temperature pro ﬁle to reduce aggrega-
tion and promote growth, (2) a comparison of coaxial andradial mixers for in situ generation of seed crystals, and (3)
the improvement of hydrodynamics for reducing variations inproduct quality.
3.1. Preliminary Experiment with Temperature Baths
to Reduce Aggregation and Promote Growth. After
crystal nucleation in a tube under laminar ﬂow (no mixer, Re
number of about 150; see Figure 2a) and slug formation(Figure 4a), the solids amount increases in the slugs as theymove along the tube length, indicated by the whiter color ofslurry slugs (Figure 4b, top) observed visually after a short
period of growth. Under high initial solute concentrations,
the slugs were able to carry 12.3 wt % crystals in the slurry,with crystals nearly occupying the whole slug (Figure 4b) at areasonably fast ﬂow rate (Table 1). The total yield (mass of
product crystals/total mass of solute) from this preliminary
experiment was 87%, close to the theoretical yield of a batchcooling experiment from the same hot solution (87.5%).
Theﬁnal product crystals after growth from laminar ﬂow
nucleation were small and aggregated (Figure 7a) (LAM has astrong tendency toward aggregation
20). Heating followed by

using Proportional-Integral controllers tuned by Internal Model
Control.30,31The dual head transfers both inlet and outlet water,
keeping the water level of the reservoir constant. The temperature of
the slugs in the tube increases or decreases relatively slowly due to thelow thermal conductivity of the tube wall. Only one temperature bath
is needed for coarse temperature control; additional temperature baths
enable ﬁner tuning of the spatial temperature pro ﬁle of the slugs as
they move through the tube.Crystal Growth & Design Article
dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg401715e |Cryst. Growth Des. 2014, 14, 851 −860 855natural cooling in the tubing after the ﬁrst stage of growth was
expected to increase the crystal size,24,25which was observed
experimentally (Figure 7b). Heating followed by cooling in two
baths of controlled temperatures was able to further increase
the average crystal size and reduce aggregation (Figure 7c).Some small crystals remained, which motivated the implemen-
tation of mixers to provide better control of nucleation, which
is described next.
3.2. Improved Hydrodynamics (e.g., Coaxial Mixing)
to Improve Nucleation from Laminar Flow. The product
crystals obtained when nucleation was induced by coaxial
mixing (Figure 8) improved the seed crystal quality (Figure 9),
with less aggregation and narrower CSD in each slug, comparedto nucleation in laminar ﬂow (Figures 7a and A2, Supporting
Information). Crystals nucleated by impinging a hot and a cold
solution at an approximately equimolar ratio (Table 1) in a small
volume can be more uniform in size than crystals nucleated by
cooling from a single solution, as high local supersaturation(much higher than the average supersaturation) can be obtained
near the interface between hot and cold solutions when the
thermal di ﬀusivity is much larger than the molecular di ﬀusivity,
as experimentally demonstrated and explained in a previous
study.
20By combining two streams, the coaxial mixer also has
more intense mixing than would be obtained using one stream,26
with a Re ≈600, which is expected to lead to more uniform-
sized crystals due to more crystals following a similar
supersaturation trajectory in the crystal phase diagram.
While each slug obtained using the coaxial mixer (Figure 8)
had orders-of-magnitude less aggregation than the preliminaryexperiment (Figure 7), the crystal number per unit volume
and mean crystal size were variable from one slug to another(Figure 8). With nucleation using a coaxial mixer, the
crystal size distribution was narrow within nearly each slug
(Figure 8a −f). The variation in size of crystals before slug forma-
tion (Figure 9) is similar to that within a single slug (Figure 8,Table 3), which suggests that the mixing within each slug(from internal recirculation
19) may be su ﬃcient for maintaining
a spatially uniform environment of temperature and concen-tration after nucleation. In particular, if the mixing had not been

Figure 9. Seed crystals generated by cooling nucleation in a coaxial
mixer. The background is a membrane ﬁlter with a pore size of 10 μm.
Theﬂow setups are in Figure 2b. Although the quantitative size of
measured seed crystals is a combination of both nucleation and growth
(with local supersaturation not easy to measure at ﬁne spatial
resolution), this image does qualitatively show the coaxial mixing
reduces crystal aggregation and CSD width compared to laminar ﬂow.Crystal Growth & Design Article
dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg401715e |Cryst. Growth Des. 2014, 14, 851 −860 856suﬃcient, there would have been a small number of crystals
much larger than shown in Figure 8, such as observed at thebottom of poorly mixed batch crystallizers. The slug-to-slugvariability suggested that some experimental component wasinducing oscillations to the experimental system, which led to aneﬀort to reduce ﬂow pulsations from the peristaltic pumps (the
experimental details are in sections 2.1 and 2.2, with the resultsdiscussed in next section).
3.3. Improved Hydrodynamics (e.g., Reducing Flow
Variation) to Reduce Slug-to-Slug Variability. With the
objective of reducing slug-to-slug variability, ﬂow pulsations
were reduced by replacing the peristaltic pump for cold liquidsolution with a syringe pump, and by implementing o ﬀ-
setting dual heads of the peristaltic pump for the gas ﬂow.
Since another goal was to reduce variability generally, theslug shape was modi ﬁed to improve mixing within each slug.
In particular, better mixing is expected from a slug whoseaspect ratio is close to 1, such as for the slugs in Figures 5band 10b, rather than larger aspect ratios as for the slugs inFigures 4b and 10a. An aspect ratio closer to 1 was expected tomake the crystals more spread out within each slug, which wasexperimentally con ﬁrmed (Figure 10a,b). The e ﬀect of aspect
ratio on mixing within each slug was more obvious with higherﬂow rates.
In addition, the coaxial mixer was replaced by a radial mixer,
which provides much better mixing for systems of comparablevelocities.
27Compared with the coaxial mixer (Figure 8a −f,
Table 3), the radial mixer experiment produced similar meanaspect ratios and coe ﬃcient of variations in length and width
(Figure 11a −f, Table 4) within each slug but larger mean
crystal dimensions and much lower variability in crystal shape(i.e., aspect ratio) within each slug. The reduction of variabilityof the product crystal shape in the radial mixer experiment maybe attributed to its reduced ﬂow variability. The use of either
coaxial or radial mixers reduced aggregation by orders-of-magnitude compared to laminar ﬂow (compare Figures 8 and
11 with Figure 7).
4. CONCLUSIONS
High-quality nonaggregating LAM crystals were produced in acontinuous- ﬂow cooling crystallizer that employed alternating
slugs of slurry and air moving through a tube with a residencetime of 2 −5 min. The most novel aspects of the experimental
system are that (1) the crystals were nucleated by mixinghot and cold solutions in coaxial and radial mixers instead ofrapid cooling of a single solution
4,6or feeding seeds obtained
by batch crystallization as done in many past continuous-ﬂow cooling crystallization studies,28and (2) the slugs were
spontaneously induced by hydrodynamic forces rather thanby alternating the feed between the two inlet ﬂows.5As used in
some past studies,3,5air was employed as the separating ﬂuid so
that no liquid −liquid separations are needed downstream from
the crystallization.
The slugs generated spontaneously by hydrodynamic forces
were highly uniform in size and shape, and the slugs maintainedthat uniformity during crystallization as the slugs moved
through the tubular crystallizer. The slug size and shape were
controllable by just changing the ratio of volumetric ﬂows rates
of the inlet streams of slurry and air. An in-line imaging systemwas employed to study the e ﬀect of slug aspect ratio, which
conﬁrmed the expectation that aspect ratios near 1 produced
better mixing than larger aspect ratios. The size uniformityof the product crystals was enhanced by the introduction ofTable 3. Product Crystal Size and Shape Statistics for Slug-Flow Crystallization, for Nucleation Using Coaxial MixingCorresponding to the Experimental Results Reported in Figure 8a

employing in-line ﬁnes dissolution involving a nonmonotonic
spatial temperature pro ﬁle (cooling, then heating, then cooling).
The crystals grown from nuclei produced in a radial mixer were
more uniform in size compared to a coaxial mixer (compare
Figures 11 and 8). The high degree of mixing and small sizeof each slug promoted high spatial uniformity of temperature
within each slug.
The experimental system can be used to simplify scale-up as
the slug volume can be selected as the same volume as thebatch crystallizer used in bench-scale experiments for initialprocess development. The residence time of 2 −5 min is orders

aThe correlation coe ﬃcient of length and width is near 1 for each slug, which indicates a high consistency in aspect ratio among di ﬀerent slugs
(a correlation coe ﬃcient of length and width of 1 would correspond to all crystals having exactly the same shape).Crystal Growth & Design Article

crystallization, enabled by the much higher supersaturationsthat can be generated within a slug while maintaining pure-growth conditions (the slug does not have a stirring blade,which is the primary source of secondary nuclei and attritionparticles in a mixed-tank crystallizer). With further optimiza-tion, it is likely that the residence time could be brought downto less than 1 min. The slug- ﬂow crystallizer has higher
equipment utilization, as the experimental system can generatecrystals with narrow CSD with orders-of-magnitude highersupersaturation and growth rate than obtainable using a stirredtank of the same volume. Instead of scale-up, throughputcan be further increased by scale-out, that is, using more slugs.While scale-out has already been discussed many times in theliterature for microscale systems,
29this approach is much
more industrially relevant for the length scales considered in
this article, at least for the typical production rate for apharmaceutical compound.
