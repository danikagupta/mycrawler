ABSTRACT 
Author: Gongliang Zhang Title: Roles of Serotonin 2A Receptor in a Serotonin Syndrome Institution: Florida Atlantic University Dissertation Advisor: Dr. Rui Tao Degree: Doctor of Philosophy Year: 2010 
 
Serotonin (5-HT) is a neurotransmitter in  the central nervous system. Decrease in 
the brain 5-HT level could induce depression, showing a state of low mood, aversion to 
motion and feeling of worthlessness. About 12 million adults in the United States have 
depression. Antidepressants, such as monoa mine oxidase inhibitors and selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors, can alleviate the depressive mood by increasing the brain’s 
5-HT activity, however they can also induce a potentially life-thr eatening side effect, 
namely 5-HT syndrome. This syndrome is ma nifested by neuromuscular hyperactivities, 
mental disorders and autonomic dysfunctions. Clinical studies have demonstrated that 
5-HT 2A receptor antagonists could effectively bloc k severe symptoms of patients with the 
5-HT syndrome. To understand the underlying mechanisms, in this study we examined 
the activity of the 5-HT 2A receptor in rats with the 5-HT syndrome evoked by a combined 
injection of   ivclorgyline, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, and paroxetine, a selective 5-HT reuptake 
inhibitor. The major findings from my study were that: (1) Chroni c clorgyline treatment 
significantly exacerbated 5-HT 2A receptor-mediated symptoms of the 5-HT syndrome 
animals; (2) The 5-HT 2A receptor-mediated symptoms were also aggravated when the 
5-HT syndrome animals were housed in warm (32 °C) ambient temperature; (3) Blocking 
5-HT 2A receptors in the medial pr efrontal cortex alleviated  the 5-HT syndrome through a 
circuit between raphe serotone rgic neurons and medial pref rontal cortex glutamatergic 
neurons. Taken together, my data de monstrate that the activity of 5-HT 2A receptors may 
be enhanced by chronic antidepressant treatme nt and warm environmental temperature. 
The sensitized 5-HT 2A receptor in the medial prefr ontal cortex may exacerbate the 
syndrome through a positive-feedback circuit be tween medial prefrontal cortex and raphe 
nuclei, which would result in excessive 5-HT in the brain. This study casts a new light on 
the underlying mechanisms of the 5-HT syndrome.  v

CHAPTER ONE: GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
 
The biogenic amine 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-H T) or serotonin was first recognized 
over one hundred years ago for its effect on the smooth muscle. Since the middle of 19
th 
century, scientists have known a chemical released from blood clots into sera could 
constrict vascular smooth muscle and increa se its tension (Frazer and Hensler, 1999) . 
Not until 1947 did Rapport et al. (1947) first isolate and name this substance as 5-HT. 
Serotonin is an alternative name for 5-HT si nce it exists in sera and induces vascular 
activities. In 1953, Twarog and Page (1953) repo rted 5-HT’s existing in the brain. At the 
physiological pH circumstance, 5-HT is a hydr ophilic substance that cannot permeate the 
lipophilic blood-brain barrier readily. Theref ore, the discovery from Twarog and Page 
indicates that brain can synthesize 5-HT by itsel f. Almost at the same time, Shore et al. 
(1955) reported that (+) lysergic acid di ethylamide (LSD), a psychomimetic, could 
reverse responses induced by 5-HT. It raised the possibility that 5-HT regulated brain 
functions. Indeed, 5-HT plays critical roles in maintaining a number of brain functions, 
and abnormalities of 5-HT activity result in a set of mental diso rders and psychiatric 
diseases, especially depression (for review , see Naughton et al., 2000; Barnes and Sharp, 
1999; Frazer and Hensler, 1999; Hensler, 2006). 
Depression is a mental disorder associated  with a low 5-HT level in the brain. The 
patients have feeling of sadness, helplessnes s and worthlessness. A breakthrough of the  2modern neurochemistry and neuropharmacol ogy on depression was the development of 
antidepressants, such as tricyclic antidepre ssants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
(MAOIs) and selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs). These agents can increase the 
extracellular 5-HT levels in the brain, alle viate depression symptoms  and rehabilitate the 
life quality of the patients. Up to now, millions of patients throughout the world are 
benefiting from these agents, however long term and inappr opriate administration of 
these compounds may give rise to many side effects, one of which is 5-HT syndrome. 
The 5-HT syndrome is an iatrogenic or drug-induced toxic side effect caused by 
excessive 5-HT in the central nervous syst em, which can be characterized by autonomic 
dysfunctions, neuromuscular hyperactivities and mental disorders (Boyer and Shannon, 
2005). Although the first case report of the s yndrome can be traced back to 50 years ago  
(Mitchell, 1955), the mechanism underlying this  disorder remains unclear. Hence, the aim 
of my project was to explore the neural m echanisms of the 5-HT syndrome with a focus 
on serotonin 2A (5-HT 2A) receptor. In order to unde rstand this immensely complex 
syndrome, the general information about the 5-HT system was described below. 
 
1.1 5-HT metabolism and distribution in the central nervous system 
 
The amino acid L-tryptophan (Trp) serves as the precursor for the synthesis of 
5-HT in our body. L-Trp is a natural amino acid in daily supplements, such as dairy 
products and meat. L-Trp can cross the blood-br ain barrier with the help of nonspecific 
amino acid transporters and enters the neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). After 
hydroxylation by Trp hydroxylase (a rate-l imiting enzyme) and decarboxylation by  35-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) decarboxylase, 5-HT is produced and stored in the vesicles 
(Fig.1) located in axon terminals of the serotonergic neurons.  
Like other biogenic amine neurotransmitte rs in the CNS, synthesized 5-HT is 
stored primarily in the presynaptic vesi cles and released by exocytosis. Neurons 
accumulate 5-HT from cytoplasm and store it in the presynaptic vesicles with the help of 
vesicular transporters. Some anti-psychiatric drugs, e.g., te trabenazine and reserpine, 
block the vesicle transporters and, thus, raise 5-HT level in the cyt oplasm and facilitate 
5-HT efflux (Gonzalez et al., 1994). Serotonerg ic neurons release 5-HT by a vesicular, 
Ca2+- and impulse-dependent exocytotic m echanism (Levi and Raiteri, 1993). After 
secreted into the synaptic cl eft, 5-HT binds presynaptic a nd postsynaptic receptors. The 
functional activity of 5-HT in the synaptic cleft is terminated with the assistance of selective 5-HT reuptake transporters (SERTs ) distributed in the presynaptic membrane. 
After reuptake, some of 5-HT recycled is rep ackaged into vesicles for reuse. The rest is 
degraded by monoamine oxidase (MAO) at mitochondria. There are two kinds of MAO 
isoform: MAO-A metabolizes 5-HT, norepin ephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA). MAO-B 
preferentially degrades trace amine (benzy lamine, phenylethylamine, tyramine) and DA 
(Bach et al., 1988) (Fig. 2). Currently, most antidepressants increase the brain 
extracellular 5-HT level by blocking eith er MAO or SERT (Horstmann and Binder, 
2009) . 
Serotonin-containing neurons in the CNS cluster along the midline of the 
brainstem. Serotonergic neuron cell bodies in the CNS are found exclusively in the 
midline raphe nuclei ranging from the midbrain to the medulla and classified into nine 
groups (B1 to B9) (Frazer and Hensler, 1999). Raphe serotonergic neurons have a wide  4connection with structures in the brain and spinal cord. The superior clusters (B5 - B9) 
send projections to cortex and subcortical structures, and the lower groups in the pons 
and medulla (B1 - B4) send axons to medulla and spinal cord (Fig. 3, Table 1) (Jacobs 
and Azmitia , 1992; Hesler, 2006). Likewise, ra phe nuclei receive afferent fibers. The 
largest afferent source is from the raphe nuc lei themselves. These fibers form a complex 
of local circuits among the nuc lei and within each nucleus  (Aghajanian and Wang, 1977). 
Other brain regions, e.g., hypothalamus, medial  preoptic area, lateral hypothalamus and 
forebrain also send projections  to the raphe nuclei (Sakai et al., 1977; Hoover and Vertes, 
2007). Dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN, B7 and B6 ) and median raphe nucleus (MRN, B8 and 
B5) are the major sources of forebrain 5- HT. DRN lies between cerebral aqueduct and 
MRN, and consists of medial, lateral and caudal components. MRN is a paramedian and 
median cluster of cells lying between superi or cerebellar decussati on and trapezoid body. 
The dorsal border of this cluster fuses with the ventromedial component of the DRN, and 
the ventral side lies in paramedian co lumns extending ventrally from the medial 
longitudinal fasciculus (Fig. 3)  (Jacobs and Azmitia, 1992).  
 
1.2 5-HT receptors  
To date, at least fourteen 5-HT rece ptor subtypes belonging to seven major 
families have been indentified in the brain. Since the first two distinct types of 5-HT 
binding sites (5-HT
1 and 5-HT 2 receptors) were reported in 1978, the research in 5-HT 
receptors has progressed considerately (Ley sen et al., 1978; Frazer and Hensler, 1999; 
Hensler, 2006). Currently, seven distinct 5-HT receptors (5-HT 1 – 5-HT 7 receptors, Table  52) have been identified due to the applic ation of novel molecular biological techniques. 
Moreover, several 5-HT receptors comprise subtypes. For example, 5-HT 1 receptor 
consists of 5-HT 1A, 5-HT 1B, 5-HT 1D, 5-HT 1E, and 5-HT 1F receptors. 5-HT receptor protein 
exists both in the presynap tic and postsynaptic membrane s in the CNS. Functionally, 
except the 5-HT 3 receptor which is a ligand-gated ion channel, all the 5-HT receptors are 
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that  activate intracellula r cascades and produce 
excitatory or inhibitory responses (Table 2). Detailed information about 5-HT receptors 
can be found in a number of reviews (Barnes and Sharp, 1999; Jacobs and Azmitia, 1992; Jacobs and Klemfuss, 1975; Naughton et al., 2000; Pritchett et al., 1988; Frazer and 
Hensler, 1999). Here the studies about 5-HT
2A receptor were reviewed for the knowledge 
served as the background relate d to this study. In addition, 5-HT 1A receptor was also 
reviewed for its close relation to the 5-HT 2A receptor in the development of the 5-HT 
syndrome (Fig. 4). 
 
5-HT 2A receptor  
The finding of 5-HT 2A receptor can be tracked back to 1978 when Leysen and his 
colleagues (1978) first indentified a novel receptor that could bind [3H]-spiperone which 
was named 5-HT 2A receptor later (Pritchett et al., 1988). Genetic and molecular 
properties of the 5-HT 2A receptor have been well understood. In human, the locus of the 
5-HT 2A receptor gene is on chromosome 13q14-q21. A great homogeneity of 5-HT 
receptor protein sequence exists among species. For example, both human and rat 5-HT 2A 
receptors consist of 471 amino acids with a 91% homology (Fig. 5). 5-HT 2A receptor is a 
member of GPCR family located in the cell membrane. Activation of 5-HT 2A receptor  6enhances activity of intracellular pho spholipase C (PLC) wh ich then hydrolyzes 
phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP 2) into inositol 1,4, 5-triphosphate (IP 3) and 
diacylglycerol (DAG). IP 3 binds its receptor in the membrane of smooth endoplasmic 
reticula and mitochondria, opens Ca2+ channels and increases intracellular Ca2+ 
concentration. Ca2+ as well as DAG activates  protein kinase C (PKC ), increases protein 
phosphorylation and, thus, leads to  a series of cellular cascad es (Roth et al., 1986). Other 
than the IP 3/DAG signaling pathway, the 5-HT 2A receptor is also coupled to arachidonic 
acid and endocannabinoid 2-ar achidonoylglycerol pathways in the peripheral tissues 
(Parrish and Nichols, 2006).   
Studies with physiological, pharmacologi cal and molecular biological techniques 
(e.g., receptor autoradiography, in situ hybr idization and immunocytochemistry) have 
revealed that 5-HT 2A receptors are widely distributed in the CNS, such as forebrain 
regions, cortical areas, caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle and 
hippocampus (Lopez-Gimenez et al., 1997; Meng od et al., 1990). Areas with the highest 
density includes, but not limited to cortex, esp ecially the frontal cortex (Pompeiano et al., 
1994; Roth et al., 1991; Wright et al., 1995) . Moreover, a number of studies have 
explored the cellular location of the 5-HT 2A receptor in the brain with double 
immunostaining. 5-HT 2A receptor proteins are expressed in  the cholinergic neurons of the 
pontomesencephalic tegmentum (Morilak and Ci aranello, 1993), cort ical glutamatergic 
neurons (de Almeida et al., 2007) and GABAergic interneurons (Willins et al., 1997). Consistently, the distribution of the 5-HT
2A receptor expression is deemed to map the 
distribution of the sero tonergic axon terminals arising fr om the raphe nuclei. For example, 
the profile of axons from DRN appears to match 5-HT 2A receptor distribution in the  7prefrontal cortex (Azmitia and Segal, 1978; Conrad et al., 1974; Jacobs and Azmitia, 
1992; Steinbusch et al., 1981).  
Activation of the 5-HT 2A receptor induces neuronal excitation. By using 
intracellular and whole cell reco rding in rat brain slices, A ghajanian and Marek (1997) 
found that bath-applied 5-HT produced an in crease in the frequency and amplitude of 
spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic pot entials/currents (EPSPs/EPSCs) in layer V 
pyramidal cells of neocortex and transitional cortex. The EPSCs were suppressed by selective 5-HT
2A receptor antagonists (e.g., MDL 100907 and SR 46349B). Similarly, the 
5-HT 2A receptor-induced neuronal excitation could also be detected in reticular 
gigantocellular nucleus, in terstitial , the parvicellular and th e lateral nuclei (Barresi et al., 
2005) as well as locus coerul eus (Szabo and Blier, 2002).  
5-HT 2A receptor participates in  the regulation of a wide  range of behaviors and 
physiological functions  (for review, see Bubar and Cunningham, 2008), for example body 
temperature. 5-HT 2A receptor mediates hyperthermia. In the brain, activation of 5-HT 2A 
receptors in the POA increases the body temp erature (Chio et al., 2005; Lin et al., 1998). 
In the peripheral tissue, 5-HT 2A receptors lead to vasoconstriction and prevention of heat 
loss (Ootsuka and Blessing, 2006). Moreover, 5-HT 2A receptors in the adipose tissue 
promote the catabolism of brown adipose tis sue (Ootsuka and Blessing, 2006). Given the 
wide distribution of the 5-HT 2A receptor in brain regions (e .g., frontal cortex) that are 
related in cognitive functions and social activities, it appears that 5-HT 2A receptor 
involves mental regulation and psyc hiatric disorders. Indeed, 5-HT 2A receptor plays an 
important role in mental activ ities and related dis eases (Jakab and Goldman-Rakic, 1998). 
Many hallucinogens (e.g., DOI and LSD) are 5-HT 2A receptor agonists modulating DA  8release and inducing schizophrenia-like symp toms. Currently there is considerable 
interest in 5-HT 2A receptor in the psychiatric disorders for some typical and atypical 
antipsychotic agents (e.g., clozapine and olanzepine) with a partial 5-HT 2A receptor 
antagonist property (Meltzer, 1999). Chronic treatment with  these antipsychotic drugs 
could decrease 5-HT 2A receptor binding capacity (Kuoppamki et al., 1995). Additionally, 
mood disorders, e.g., depression a nd anxiety, are thought to be associated with changes in 
5-HT 2A receptor expression and activity. PET scan  research indicated that there was an 
about 29% reduction of 5-HT 2A receptor binding capacity in  depressed subjects (Mintun 
et al. 2004). Long-term antidepressant  treatment down-regulated the 5-HT 2A receptor 
density in the cortex (Kuoppamki et al., 1995; Peroutka and Snyder, 1980). 
Administration of 5-HT 2A receptor agonists led to a si gnificant up-regulation of BDNF 
mRNA, a gene related to depression, in the ne ocortex (Vaidya et al., 1997). Moreover, the 
rest studies revealed a connection of the 5-HT 2A receptor to the obsessive compulsive 
disorder (OCD), attention deficit hyperac tivity disorder (ADHD), affective disorders, 
suicide and Alzheimer's disease (Norton and Owen, 2005).  
The variation of 5-HT 2A receptor activity due to antid epressant treatment has been 
the focus of many studies in the past  decades by testing the level of 5-HT 2A receptor 
protein density, sensitization and mRNA expression. Using a [3H]-spiroperidol binding 
assay, Peroutka and Snyder (1980) fi rst reported a down-regulation of 5-HT 2A receptor 
density in rats receiving a long-term antidepressant treat ment. This finding was later 
confirmed by other studies with different an tidepressants including clomipramine (a TCA) 
(Todd et al., 1995), desipramine (a TCA)  (Goodnough and Baker, 1994; Todd et al., 
1995), maprotiline (a TCA) (Todd et al., 1995), citalopram (a SSRI) (Klimek et al., 1994),  95-HTP (Pranzatelli, 2009) and phenelzin e (a MAOI) (Todd et al., 1995). Besides 
antidepressants, 5-HT 2A receptor agonists such as DOI (Pranzatelli and Pluchino, 1991; 
Anji et al., 2000), DOM (Leysen et al., 1989) and LSD (Ferry et al., 1993; Buckholtz et 
al., 1990) also significantly de creased the density of 5-HT 2A receptor. However, some 
reports showed that chronic uses of fluoxe tine (a SSRI) caused littl e changes (Todd et al., 
1995; Goodnough and Baker, 1994) or an incr ease (Klimek t al., 1994) in the 5-HT 2A 
receptor binding sites. The conflicting result s from in vivo studies probably attribute to 
the differences in experimental techniques or  conditions such as the dosage and duration 
of antidepressant exposure.  
Results of in vitro studies also showed that exposure to serotonergic compounds 
have variable effects on the 5-HT 2A receptor density and activity. Both 5-HT 2A receptor 
agonists and antagonists might up -regulate the activity of 5-HT 2A receptor transfected 
into Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, but not  into NIH 3T3 cells. The density of 5-HT 2A 
receptor could be decreased and increased, respectively by 5-HT 2A receptor agonist and 
antagonist in the transfected AtT-20 cells  (Grotewiel and Sanders-Bush, 1994). The 
down-regulation of 5-HT 2A receptors may attribute to a rapid internalization of 5-HT 2A 
receptor via endosome (V ouret-Craviari et al., 1995; Berry et al., 1996). Additionally, 
5-HT or DOI exposure increased the 5-HT 2 receptor mRNA expres sion (Akiyoshi et al., 
1993) and binding sites (Chen et al., 1995) in rat cerebellar granule cells by de novo RNA 
and protein synthesis in this  up-regulation process. Exposur e to 5-HT or its agonists 
increased the level of 5-HT 2A receptor mRNA by increasing the half life in Pll cells 
(Ferry et al., 1994; Ferry and Molinoff, 1996) as well as transfected Madin-Darby canine 
kidney cells (Grotewiel and Sanders-Bush, 1994).  10This discrepancy of the pros and cons suggests the changes of 5-HT 2A receptor 
capacity exposing to it agents depend on the cell milieu where they are expressed (Grotewiel and Sanders-Bush, 1994). In the cerebral neurons, a gonist exposure may 
increase activity of 5-HT
2A receptor. In most other cells, the agonist induced a down 
regulation of the 5-HT 2A receptor.  
Intracellular mechanisms responsible for the 5-HT 2A receptor activation 
(sensitization) after ligand exposure have also been de scribed in the literature. 5-HT 2A 
receptor agonist induced an acute down-regulation of 5-HT 2A receptor-mediated 
phosphoinositide hydrolysis in smooth muscle cultures (Pauwels et al., 1990) and NIH 3T3 cell line (Bhattacharyya et al., 2002; Grotewiel and Sanders-Bush, 1994). Since 
chronic agonist exposure did not alter the G
a/q level (Roth et al., 1995), it suggests that 
increased phosphorylation of G q/11 proteins (Shi et al., 2007) or the calcium/calmodulin - 
sensitive kinase (Chen et al., 1995) may account for the change. PKC seems to participate 
in the 5-HT 2A receptor sensitization. The PKC an tagonist could attenuate the 5-HT 2A 
receptor agonist-induced desensitization in platelets (Kagaya et al., 1990), but not in 
HEK-293 cells (V ouret-Craviari et al., 1995). V ouret-Craviari et al. (1995) proposed that 
it was the PKC activation, not th e phosphorylation of the 5-HT 2A receptor that was 
responsible for 5-HT 2A receptor desensitization. Roth  (1995) reported that the 
down-regulation of the PKC isozymes alpha  and epsilon was responsible for the 
desensitization induced by agonist exposure.  On the contrary, wohlpart and Molinoff 
(1998) found PKC and calcium could increase 5-HT 2A receptor mRNA expression in P11 
cell line. Taken together, these results sugge st a set of mechanisms involve the 5-HT 2A 
receptor sensitivity when it is exposed to its agents (Table 3).    115-HT 1A receptor 
The brain 5-HT 1A receptor was initially detected  in rat diencephalon and lower 
brain stem with 3H-5-HT binding (Nelson et al., 1981) a nd was the first 5-HT receptor to 
be fully sequenced. Genetically, human 5-HT 1A receptor gene localizes on chromosome 
5q11.2-q13 sharing 89% homo logy with the rat.  
The profile of the 5-HT 1A receptor distribution in the brain has been well mapped 
by receptor autoradiography with a number of ligands, such as [3H]-8-OH-DPAT  
(Gozlan et al., 1983), [3H]WAY-100635 and [11C] WAY-100636 (Hall et al., 1997). 
5-HT 1A receptor mRNA and binding sites are high in the hippocampus, septum, 
amygdala, cortical limbic areas and raphe nuc lei, but undetectable in caudate/putamen 
and cerebellar regions (Wright et al., 1995; Hall et al., 1997; Chalmers and Watson, 1991). 
At the cellular level, 5-HT 1A receptors are expressed in both postsynaptic neurons (e.g., 
cortical pyramidal neurons) and raphe se rotonergic neurons (Chalmers and Watson, 
1991).  
Like 5-HT 2A receptor, 5-HT 1A receptor also belongs to the GPCR family with 
seven transmembrane helices connected by intra-  and extracellular l oops (Peroutka et al., 
1981). Activating 5-HT 1A receptor inhibits adenylate cyclase second messenger system, 
decreases intracellula r cAMP concentration, activate s G-protein-coupled inwardly 
rectifying K+ channels (GIRKs; kir 3.x) (Tanaka and North, 1993; Andrade and Nicoll, 
1987) and, eventually, hyperpolarizes neurons (Fig. 4). 8-OH-DPAT is one of the most 
selective 5-HT 1A receptor agonist and WAY-100635 re presents a new class of 5-HT 1A 
receptor antagonists.  
Activation of 5-HT 1A receptor induces a wide range of behavioral and  12physiological responses in rodents, includi ng 5-HT behavioral syndrome, hypothermia, 
anxiolysis, increase in ACTH and prolactin release (Hedlund et al ., 2004; Backus et al., 
1990; Hjorth, 1985; Andrade and Nicoll, 1987;  Darmani and Zhao, 1998; Tanaka and 
North, 1993). Both brain and periph eral tissues involve the 5-HT 1A receptor-mediated 
hypothermia. In the central ner vous system, activation of 5-HT 1A receptors in the POA 
evokes hypothermia (Lin et al., 1998).  In the peripheral tissues, 5-HT 1A receptors 
contribute to cutaneous vasodilation, d ecreased metabolism and enhanced heat 
dissipation (Lin et al., 2002). 5- HT behavioral syndrome is a series of behaviors induced 
by activating post-synaptic 5-HT 1A receptor (Lucki et al., 1984) which will be covered in 
the next section. Besides be havioral regulation, the 5-HT 1A receptor also involves the 
mental regulation and dysfunction of the 5-HT 1A receptor leads to many mental disorders, 
e.g., major depression (Savitz J et al., 2009; Fornal et al., 1996).  
 
1.3 5-HT and brain functions 
 
Serotonin in the brain invol ves the regulation of a wi de range of physiological 
functions and behaviors. Since Amin first reported brain 5-HT in 1954 (Amin et al., 
1954), the role of 5-HT in the CNS have been  widely investigated  and a great progress 
has been achieved. The superior rostral end of this raphe serotonergic system sends 
projection to cortex and subc ortical structures, which i nvolves the regulation of 
sleep-wakefulness cycle, aff ective behavior, food intake, thermoregulation, migraine, 
emesis and sexual behavior. The serotonergic  neurons in the lowe r pons and medulla send 
axons to spinal and medulla, and participat e in the regulation of  nociception and motor  13tone (Saper, 2000; Blundell, 1977; Barnes a nd Sharp, 1999). Dysfunction of the serotonin 
system in the brain results in a great array of  disorders including de pression, irritability, 
aggression, impatience and anxiety, especially  with suicidal depression patients showing 
a significant decrease in 5-HT  levels (for review, see Saper, 2000; Jacobs and Azmitia, 
1992; Kriegebaum et al., 2010). Decrease in brain 5-HT level is a majo r factor associated 
with the depression, a state of low mood, aversi on to motion and feeling of worthlessness. 
An advance of modern neuropharmacology was th e synthesis and application of a set of 
antidepressants including tricyclics, lithium, MAO inhibitors and SSRIs. These antidpressants can raise brain 5-HT levels , alleviate the depre ssant syndrome and 
improve mood (Jacobs and Azmitia, 1992; Sape r, 2000; Kriegebaum et al., 2010). Like a 
double-edged sword, antidepressant  exposure could also induce a series of side effects 
including euphoria, hypomania, restlessness, rapid speech, anxiety, insomnia, aggressiveness, agitation, light headedness and peripheral side effects (e.g., nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia) (Nonherbal. 1998; van Vliet et al. 1996). Clinically, some 
of these side effects have been typically classified into the symptoms of the 5-HT 
syndrome. 
 
1.4 Serotonin syndrome 
 History 
Theoretically, 5-HT syndrome can be defi ned as an iatrogenic disorder resulted 
from pharmacological treatment with 5-HT-sel ective agents that excessively elevate the 
level of extracellular 5-HT in  the brain (Baloh et al., 1982 ; Darmani and Ahmad , 1999;  14Oates and Sleight, 1960). The fi rst case of the 5-HT syndrom e could be tracked back to 
half a century ago when a patient died from the co-administration of a MAOI iproniazid 
and a synthetic narcotic compound meperidi ne (Mitchell, 1955). Due to the limited 
knowledge about 5-HT, this incident was misd iagnosed and received little attention for 
decades. In the following years, a great num ber of 5-HT-related behavioral abnormalities 
were described in animals with elevated brain 5-HT level (Jacobs, 1976). Jacobs (1976) 
summarized the related animal reports and propo sed a specific term “serotonin behavioral 
syndrome” to define the 5-HT-mediated behaviors. The term “5-HT syndrome” was first introduced by Insel et al. (1982). After the 1980s, more and more antidepressant-related 
toxicity were reported. Some patients have th e similar behavioral symptoms as described 
early in the 5-HT behavioral syndrome animal s. To standardize the diagnosis, Sternbach 
(1991) reviewed 38 human case re ports that had been published in literature up to that 
time and defined a criterion of the 5-HT syndrome in human. After that, 5-HT syndrome 
was widely adopted by clinical professiona ls and lab researcher s. Even though 5-HT 
syndrome is widely used, many researchers employed other terms including 5-HT toxic 
syndrome, 5-HT toxidrome, 5-HT behavioral syndrome or 5-HT toxicity to substitute 
5-HT syndrome in publications. 
 
Epidemiology 
To date, the 5-HT syndrome has become a common clinical problem in medicine 
associated with increasing prescription of antidepressants as well as abusing of 
serotonergic drugs (Isbiste r et al., 2007; Bronstein et al., 2008). The American 
Association of Poison Control Centers-National Poison Data Sy stem, which receives case  15descriptions from office-based practices, inpa tient settings and emergency departments, 
reported an increasing incident of antidepr essant toxicity and death resulted from 
antidepressant exposure in the past decad es (Fig. 6). There were 98,898 incidences 
reported due to antidepressant exposure and 220 deaths in 2007 (Brons tein et al., 2008).  
The incidence of 5-HT syndrome may be underestimated. First,  clinicians or 
patients might misfile the incident reports  of the syndrome due to its variable 
manifestations. For example, they attributed  the anxiety and akathisia to the patient's 
mental disorder (Sampson and Warner, 1999) . Second, a strict application of the 
diagnostic criterion proposed by Sternbach potentially rules out what are now recognized 
as mild, early, or subacute cases of the di sorder (Radomski et al., 2000; Sternbach, 1991; 
Hegerl et al., 1998). Third, some physicians may be unaware of the 5-HT syndrome as a 
clinical diagnosis (Mackay et  al., 1999). Therefore, performing a rigorous epidemiologic 
assessment of the 5-HT syndrome is difficult. It  is predicated that the syndrome occurs in 
approximately 14 to 16 percent of persons w ho overdose on SSRIs (Isbister et al., 2004). 
 
Agents associated with the 5-HT syndrome 
In theory, any agents with an ability of  increasing 5-HT activity in the brain can 
induce the 5-HT syndrome. 5-HT syndrome has b een reported in patients with a history 
of taking MAOIs (Kojima et al., 1993), tricyclic  antidepressants (TCA s) (Hodgman et al., 
1997; Spigset et al., 1993), SSRIs (Bhanji, 2000; Pao and Tipnis, 1997; Graber et al., 
1994; Bhanji, 2000; Pao and Tipnis, 1997), opi ate analgesics, over-the-counter cough 
medicines (Skop et al., 1995; Ener et al., 2003 ), etc. The withdrawal of medications has 
also been associated with the syndrome (for review, see Ener et al., 2003). Functionally,  16these agents can be classified into severa l groups: (1) Increase the precursor supply (e.g., 
5-HTP); (2) Increase 5-HT release (e .g., amphetamines); (3) Block the reuptake 
transporters (e.g., SSRIs); (4) Inhibit the catabolic  enzymes (in the cleft and presynaptic 
neurons) (e.g., MAOIs); (5) I nhibit the presynaptic 5-HT 1A receptor (e.g., sumatriptan); (6) 
Stimulate the postsynaptic signal transduction (e.g., lithium); (7) Increase the sensitivity of the postsynaptic receptors (e.g., buspirone) (Loza, 1995; Muly et al., 1993; Karle and 
Bjorndal, 1995).  In most circumstances, 5-HT syndrome is evoked by a drug combination. 
The combination of MAOIs with meperidine , dextromethorphan, SSRIs or amphetamine 
(MDMA, or "ecstasy") are strongly associat ed with malignant cases of the syndrome 
(Ener et al., 2003). A single therapeutic dose of a SSRI, for exampl e sertraline (Kaminski 
et al., 1994), fluvoxamine (Bastani et al., 1996) , venlafaxine (Kolecki, 1997), mirtazapine 
(Hernandez et al., 2002) and citalopram (Tseng et al., 2005) had also be reported to evoke 
the 5-HT syndrome.  
 
Clinical manifestations 
Clinical manifestations observed in the 5-HT syndrome patients range from tremor 
and diarrhea in mild cases to coma, muscular  rigidity and hypertherm ia in life-threatening 
ones (Ener et al., 2003). Typically, there are mental-status di sorders, automatic 
hyperactivities and neuromuscular abnormalitie s (Boyer and Shannon, 2005; Hegerl et al., 
1998; Sternbach, 1991) (Table 4). 
Not all the symptoms listed are present in patients with this disorder. Mild cases 
may be afebrile but have musc ular activities (e.g., limb termin al shivering) and automatic 
abnormalities (e.g., tachycardia, diaphoresis a nd mydriasis). The neurologic examination  17may reveal intermittent tremor or myoclonus  as well as hyperreflexia. In contrast, a 
patient with a moderate to severe synd rome may have hyperthermia, hypertension and 
tachycardia that may abruptly deteriorate in to frank shock. The onset of symptoms is 
usually rapid with clinical fi ndings occurring within minutes after a switch in medication, 
an overdose or self-poisoning. Approximately  60 percent of patients with the 5-HT 
syndrome present within six hours afte r medication (Boyer and Shannon, 2005).  
 
Diagnosis and treatments 
The diagnostic criterion of 5-HT syndro me was firstly put forward by Sternbach 
(1991). Based on Sternbach’s criterion, patient s meeting the following three items will be 
diagnosed as the 5-HT syndrome. 1. Recent addition or increase known serotonergic 
agents and induce at least three of the following syndromes: mental status changes 
(confusion, hypomania), agitation, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, diaphoresis, shivering, 
tremor, diarrhea, incoordination, fever; 2. Ex clude other possible etiologies, such as 
withdrawal, infection, and so on; 3. There is  no addition of a neuroleptic agent recently. 
During the following years, this criterion wa s revised by Hegerl ( 1998), Randomski and 
Dursun (2000), Kaneda (2000) and Boyer (2005) . Recently, Isbister et  al. (2007) brought 
forward a new criterion - the H unter Serotonin Toxicity Crit erion – which are much more 
specific for screening 5-HT syndrome. 
The treatment of the 5-HT syndrome remains controversial and no specific 
antidotes are available to date. The primary management is supportive therapies. For the 
mild cases, cessation of any serotonergic agents and addition of  supportive therapies 
consisting of rehydration, external cooling, char coal lavage and dialys is can alleviate the  18syndrome. Most cases resolve in 24 to 36 hours (Ener et al., 2003). For severe cases, the 
initial treatment is to maintain the function of airway, breathing a nd circulation. Besides 
the treatments used in the mild cases, sp ecific pharmacological treatments should be 
applied. Benzodizaepines, such as diazepam (Fisher and Davis, 2002), are the first line treatment to reduce excessive sympathetic outflow, control seizures, decrease the 
myoclonus and muscle rigidity, reduce hyperthe rmia and rhabdomyolysis (Ener et al., 
2003). 5-HT
2A receptor antagonist cyproheptadine (Lappin and Auchincloss, 1994; 
Graudins et al., 1998) and DA receptor antagonist chlorpromazine(Gillman, 1996, 1999) could significantly reduce the severity and mo rtality of the 5-HT syndrome subjects .  
 
Animal research on the 5-HT syndrome  
Before 5-HT syndrome was adopted in clinical cases (Insel et al., 1982), 
researchers have noticed that the increase in  brain 5-HT level coul d produce a series of 
behaviors in many species (e.g., rats, mice,  hamsters, cats and dogs) (Jacobs, 1976; 
Deakin and Green, 1978; Sloviter et al., 1978) . Jacobs (1976) defined a term “5-HT 
behavioral syndrome” as a simultaneous disp lay of four of six symptoms including 
hindlimb adduction, forepaw treading, lateral he ad weaving, resting tremor, rigidity and 
Straub tail. The 5-HT behavioral syndrome was considered as 5-HT syndrome today. 
Currently, just several labs explored the mechanisms of the 5-HT syndrome in animals 
models developed by increasing brain 5-HT level (Izumi et al., 2007; Ma et al., 2008; 
Nisijima et al., 2001, 2003, 2004). The symptoms of the 5-HT syndrome animals share 
some characteristics seen in human cases. Ta ble 5 lists the manifestations that can be 
commonly observed in the 5-HT syndrome animals.   19Both brain and spinal cord are involved in the etiology of 5-HT syndrome. For 
example, the 5-HT syndrome behaviors still ex isted after lower brainstem transections 
(Jacobs and Klemfuss, 1975). Infusion of DOI into the CA1 region of the dorsal 
hippocampus elicited head bobs that were bl ocked by prior local in jection of the 5-HT 2A 
receptor antagonist (Dave et al., 2004). Meanwh ile, selective destruction of spinal 5-HT 
terminals enhanced the syndrome elicited by 5-HT receptor agonists (Deakin and Green, 
1978).  
Theoretically, all, if not all, 5-HT recepto rs are activated in the 5-HT syndrome due 
to excessive 5-HT in the CNS. Of these, 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A receptors are the major 
targets responsible for the most symptoms  of the syndrome. 8-OH-DPAT, a selective 
5-HT 1A receptor agonist, at high doses (>0.7 mg /kg) induced 5-HT syndrome behaviors, 
including head weaving, hindlimb abduction, fo repaw treading and tremor (Yamada et al., 
1988). Those behaviors were also observed in  animals treated with non-selective 5-HT 
receptor agonists or antidepressants (Tricklebank et al., 1984; Deakin and Green, 1978; 
Ma et al., 2008). In support of involvement of 5-HT 1A receptors, selective 5-HT 1A 
receptor antagonists (e.g., WAY-100635, spiperone)  could to some extent prevent these 
behaviors (Tricklebank et al., 1984 ). Although the majority of 5-HT 1A receptor is an 
autoreceptor located in the presynaptic membrane, the 5-HT 1A receptor responsible for 
the 5-HT syndrome behaviors is likely due to  activation of the postsynaptic site. Several 
studies have revealed that inhibition of 5-HT synthesis with PCPA, destroying 5-HT 
neurons with 5,7-DHT, or depl etion of 5-HT with reserp ine failed to inhibit the 
8-OH-DPAT-induced behaviors (Tricklebank et  al., 1984; Goodwin et al., 1986; Sloviter 
et al., 1978; Yamada et al., 1988). Besides 5-HT 1A receptors, 5-HT 2A receptors are  20responsible for, if not all, the head shake be havior in the syndrome animals (Lucki et al., 
1984). DOI, a 5-HT 2A receptor agonist, also evokes head  shakes in animals (Darmani and 
Zhao, 1998). Likewise, selective 5-HT 2A receptor antagonists (e.g., ketanserin) or 
nonselective 5-HT antagonist metergoline or methysergide blocked head shakes in the 
5-HT syndrome animals (Lucki et al., 1984; Nisijima et al., 2001).  
The change in core body temperature ( Tcor) is an important manifestation of the 
5-HT syndrome animals. Unlike the clinical human cases that display hyperthermia, the 
5-HT syndrome animal have tri-phase changes of Tcor correlated to the extrasynaptic 
5-HT concentration (Zhang et al., 2009). With the increase in the brain 5-HT level, 5-HT 
syndrome animals display hypothermia, normothermia and hyperthermia subsequently (Zhang et al., 2009; Abde l-Fattah et al., 1997). 5-HT
1A and 5-HT 2A receptors mediate the 
hypothermia and hyperthermia, respectively (M a et al., 2008). It has been further 
suggested that the neurol ogical balance between 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A receptor activities 
could result in the normotherm ia of the body temperature in animals with a mild to 
moderate syndrome. 
 
5-HT 2A receptor and the 5-HT syndrome 
5-HT 2A receptor plays a critical role in the etiology of the 5-HT syndrome. Animal 
studies revealed that 5-HT 2A receptor antagonists could prevent the fatality, reverse the 
hyperthermia, alleviate the neuromuscular hyper activities of animals with a severe 5-HT 
syndrome (a state of animal having continue  tremor, over 60 times /min forepaw treading, 
All limb out from body, persistent Stra ub tail, immobility and increase in body 
temperature) (Nisijima et al., 2001, 2003; Ma et al., 2008). Clinical reports showed that  215-HT 2A receptor antagonists (e .g., cyproheptadine and chlorp romazine) could alleviate 
the symptoms and prevent death of the pati ents with the 5-HT syndrome (Lappin and 
Auchincloss, 1994; Graudins A et al., 1998; Gillman, 1996; Graham, 1996). These data suggest that 5-HT
2A receptor might work as a key me diator that mediates the 5-HT 
syndrome from benign to malignant or death.  
Even though 5-HT 2A receptor is deemed to be i nvolved in the 5-HT syndrome, the 
neurological mechanisms underlying it are not we ll investigated. In this study, the role of 
5-HT 2A receptors in the scenario of 5-HT syndr ome would be explored with an animal 
model developed by clorgyline, a MAOI, and par oxetine, a SSRI, in four aspects. Clinic 
reports showed that patients susceptible to 5-HT syndrome mo stly have a long history of 
taking antidepressants and measures  taken to lower body temperature  can alleviate the 
5-HT syndrome. Therefore,  aim I of this study was to explore the changes of 5-HT 2A 
receptor activity in an imals receiving chronic clorgyline treatment.  After that, the effects 
of environmental temperature on the 5-HT 2A receptor activity were examined in aim II. 
The third aim was to characterize the 5-HT s yndrome in animals. The last aim of this 
study was to investigate the effects of 5-HT 2A receptor in the mPFC that may aggravate 
the syndrome by activating a circu it between raphe nuclei and mPFC.  22

receptors 
5-HT 2A receptor, a G-protein coupled receptor on cell surface, activates phospholipase C 
(PLC) in the cytoplasm which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2) 
into inositol 1,4,5- triphosphate (IP 3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP 3 promotes Ca2+ release 
by activating IP 3 receptors in the membrane of the smooth endoplasmic reticula and 
mitochondria. Ca2+ and DAG activate protein kinase  C (PKC), which phosphorylates 
proteins, changes their catalytic activities, and leads to series of cellular effects. 
Activation of the 5-HT 1A receptor inhibits the activities  of adenosine cyclase (AC) and 
PLC, resulting in opening of potassium ch annels and hyperpolarization of the host 
neuron.    30

CHAPTER TWO: THE ENHANCED ACTIVITY OF THE SEROTONIN 2A 
RECEPTOR IS THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM RESPONSIBLE FOR A 
MALIGNANT SEROTONIN SYNDROME 
 
2.1 Introduction 
 
Both animal studies and clinical re ports have demonstrated that 5-HT 2A receptors 
play a crucial role in the e tiology of the 5-HT syndrome (Zhang et al., 2009; Nisijima et 
al., 2001, 2004). Lab studies rev ealed that activating 5-HT 2A receptor mimicked some 
symptoms as seen in the syndrome animal s (Miller et al., 1996; Koek et al., 1992). 
Selective 5-HT 2A receptor antagonists could suppress the behavioral abnormalities, 
hyperthermia, brain 5-HT excess and mortalit y of the severe 5-HT syndrome animals 
developed by increasing extracellular 5-HT le vel in the brain (Ma et  al., 2008; Zhang et 
al., 2009; Nisijima et al., 2001, 2004). Consistently, clinical case reports stated that agents 
with blocking 5-HT 2A receptor capacity (e.g., cyproheptad ine and chlorpromazine) could 
alleviate the symptoms and prevent mortalit y of the 5-HT syndrome patients (Lappin and 
Auchincloss , 1994; Graudins et al., 1998; Gillman, 1996; Graham, 1996). To date, it is 
generally accepted that 5-HT 2A receptors mediate the severe 5-HT syndrome (Ma et al., 
2008).  
Both in vivo and in vitro studies have  indicated that chronic antidepressant  40exposure altered 5-HT 2A receptor capacity and sensitiv ity (Peroutka and Snyder, 1980; 
Todd et al., 1995; Grotewiel and Sanders-B ush, 1994). However, the 5-HT syndrome 
animal models employed today were develope d mostly with an acute administration of 
proserotonergic agents (e.g., 5-HTP, MAOI) to drug-naïve animals (Nisijima et al., 2001, 
2004; Ma et al., 2008). A discre pancy between the clinical 5-HT syndrome cases and 
current animal models is that patients have  a long history of ta king antidepressants. 
Therefore, the 5-HT 2A receptor activity of the patient may changed, which can not be 
reflected by lab researches w ith drug-naïve animals.  
To illuminate the change of 5-HT 2A receptor activity in the 5-HT syndrome 
patients, a new 5-HT animal model was deve loped with a MAOI (clorgyline) and SSRI 
(paroxetine) for this combination was the most common drug regimen reported in human 
syndrome cases (Boyer and Shannon, 2005). Animal s received clorgyline for days before 
paroxetine challenge to induce the 5-HT syndr ome. The aim of this study was to explore 
the change of 5-HT 2A receptor activity to repeated cl orgyline treatment in our 5-HT 
syndrome animals. Since this syndrome occurred in patients with a chronic antidepressant 
treatment (Boyer and Shannon, 2005), it was hypothesized that chronic clorgyline 
treatment would increase the activity of 5-HT 2A receptor.   412.2 Materials and methods 
 Animal preparation   
Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (280- 350 g, purchased from Charles River 
Laboratories, Raleigh, NC, USA) were gr oup-housed under a12:12- hour light/dark cycle 
(lights on at 8:00 a.m.) in a temperature (22.0 ± 1.0 °C) and humidity (60 ± 10%) - controlled facility with free acce ss to food and water. All animal use procedures were in 
strict accordance with the NIH Guide for th e Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and 
approved by the local animal study committees. All efforts were made to reduce the number of animals used and their suffering. 
 
Chemicals and schedule for administration  
Clorgyline (N-methyl-N-propargyl-3 -[2, 4-dichlorophenoxy]-propylamine 
hydrochloride), (±) DOI-hydrochloride ((+)–1-(4-iodo-2, 5-dimethoxyphenyl)–2- 
aminopropane hydrochloride) and WA Y-100635 ({(N-{2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1- 
piperazinyl] ethyl}-N- (2-pyr idinyl) cyclo-hexanecarboxamide}) were purchased from 
Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Par oxetine was obtained from USP (Rockwille, 
MD, USA) and ketanserin tartrate was from  Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO, USA). 
Table 6 lists the dose, solvent, volume and rout e of each chemical used in this chapter. 
 
Preparation of the 5-HT syndrome animal  
The 5-HT syndrome animal model used in the study was developed by clorgyline 
and paroxetine. Animals received clorgylin e (2 mg/kg, s.c.) once daily at 12:00 noon for  420, 3 or 6 days according to different protocols. On the following day, animals were 
challenged with paroxetine and clorgylin e. If an antagonist was applied, it was 
administrated half an hour before paroxetine  challenge. In the c ontrol groups, vehicle 
substituted the agents. All the data were collected on the last day. 
 
Core body temperature measurement 
Animals habituated individually in transparent Plexiglas bowl in a 
temperature-controlled environment for at least 2 hours before experiments. A thin, 
flexible thermoprobe connected to a digital meter (Traceable®, Fisher Science) was 
inserted 5.0 cm into rectum and stayed at least 30 sec before a stable readout. Two 
measurements were taken as a baseline be fore drug injection a nd six readouts were 
collected after the drug challenge. The interval was one hour.  
 
Head shake  
Head shake (head twitch) is a behavior of  shaking head (not the whole body) in a 
short and firm way. The intensity of 5-HT 2A receptor activity was strongly correlated with 
the frequency of the shakes (Marek, 2003). Ba sed on the preliminary study from our lab 
as well as other’s reports (Speiser et al ., 2008), frequency of head shakes was more 
prominent right after paroxetin e challenge and decreasing with  time. Therefore, only the 
first hour of head shakes after paroxetine  challenge was collec ted in this study. 
 
Surgery and microdialysis procedures 
Rats were anesthetized by a combination of  xylazine (6 mg/kg, i. p.) and ketamine  43(80 mg/kg, i. p.), and mounted in a Kopf ster eotaxic frame in a flat skull position. Guide 
cannulae (22 gauge steel tube) were implante d below the skull surface aiming to right 
mPFC, right POA (Table 7) (Paxinos a nd Watson, 1998). After surgery, rats were 
recovered for one week before experiments.  
On the day before microdialysis, rats we re briefly inhaled with isoflurane for 
anesthesia. I-shaped microdialysis probes (c ut-off 18 kD) were used in this study. 
Dialysis probe was inserted through the guide  cannula targeting at the mPFC or POA and 
secured in place with dental cement (Fig. 7). The probe inlet was attached to a perfusion 
line from Raturn ™ system (Bioanalytical System Inc ., W. Lafayette, IN), and infused 
with the artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aC SF; containing 140 mM Na Cl, 3 mM KCl, 1.5 
mM CaCl 2, 1 mM MgCl 2, 0.25 mM NaH 2PO 4, and 1.0 mM Na 2HPO 4; pH: 7.4) at a flow 
rate of 1 µl/min. Next day, two dialysate sa mples were collected to obtain the basal value 
before administration of drugs. Samples we re collected once per hour starting at 10:00 
a.m. 
 
5-HT assay with HPLC-electrochemical detection  
5-HT was determined by HPLC-electroch emical detection (HTEC-500; EICOM, 
Japan) with a CMA/200 refrig erator microsampler (CMA /Microdialysis, Stockholm, 
Sweden). A reverse-phase column (4.6 × 30 mm, packed with a PP-ODS) was used for 5-HT separation. The composition of mobile phase was 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 1% methanol, 500 mg/L sodium-1 -octanesulfonate and 50 mg/L ethylene 
diamine-tetracetic acid. The flow rate was 350 μl/min and the potential set on the graphite 
electrode was + 350 mV (relative to Ag/A gCl reference electr ode). Extracellular  44concentrations of 5-HT was estimated by rati oning peak area with its internal standard by 
Powerchrom V2.2 software. The run time was 7.5 min (Fig. 8).  
 
Histology 
Upon completion an experiment, the rats we re deeply anesthetized with ketamine 
(100 mg/kg, i.p.) combined with xylazine (4 mg/kg, i.p.). Probes were infused with a 2% 
Fast Green for 10 min. The animals were then decapitated and brains were removed, frozen in – 80 °C, and sliced freehand. The probe location was visual inspected by 
comparison to the rat brain atlas (Paxinos  and Watson, 1998). A modification of this 
procedure was used in making photomicrogr aphs. A 2% solution of Fast Green was 
perfused through the dialysis probe for 10 mi n. The rat was then perfused intracardially 
with 0.9% saline followed by 4% buffered paraformaldehyde solution. The brain was 
removed and sliced in 40 µm sections usi ng a microtome (Leica CM 1850). Sections were 
mounted on slides and counterstained using a st andard Cresyl Violet  method. Slides were 
taken pictures with a microscope (Olympus AX70). Data were excluded from analysis 
when probes were located out side target structures. 
 
Data analysis 
Body temperature was expressed with the absolute values or changes to the 
baseline. Microdialysis results of 5-HT were expressed as pg per sample (60 µl) or fold 
increase to the baseline. Data in the Fi gures were showed as mean ± SEM of the 
respective time points. Two-way repeated m easures analysis of variance (ANOV A) of 
raw data with time as repeated factor and dos e or treatment as dependent factor was used  45to evaluate overall response among the control and experimental groups. When 
significant effects were found, post hoc  Scheffe’s test was used to compare effects of 
different treatment groups. One-way ANOV A and student t-test were also used to assess 
the statistical differences among groups. The Fi sher exact test was us ed to substitute a 
Chi Square test to analyze the mortality rate if  one or more cells in the data have a value 
of five or less. The significant level was set at p < 0.05. 462.3 Results  
 Changes in T
cor in the 5-HT syndrome animals with acute or chronic 
clorgyline treatment 
The basal (prior challenge) Tcor of animals with 0-, 3- and 6-day clorgyline 
treatment were 37.6 ± 0.1 °C ( n = 50), 37.7 ± 0.2 °C ( n = 10) and 38.2 ± 0.1 °C ( n = 14), 
respectively. Repeated clorgylin e treatment increased the basal Tcor as demonstrated by 
one-way ANOV A (F 2, 71 = 11.0, p < 0.001).  Post hoc  comparisons showed that 6-day 
clorgyline treatment significantly increased the Tcor (p < 0.001, Scheffe’s test), while 
3-day clorgyline treatment had no effect on Tcor (p > 0.05, Scheffe’s test) when compared 
with the Tcor of naïve animals. 
Since hyperthermia is indicativ e of activation of the 5-HT 2A receptor in the 5-HT 
syndrome (Nisijima et al., 2001), here the change in Tcor of the 5-HT syndrome animals 
induced by a challenge injection of paroxeti ne and clorgyline was recorded. Figure 9a 
showed effect of single administration of paroxetine or clorgyline altered the Tcor of the 
drug-naïve animals. Two-way repeated measur es ANOV A revealed a significant effect of 
treatment (F 2, 14 = 7.3, p < 0.01), time (F 7, 98 = 7.2, p < 0.001) and treatment × time (F 14, 98 
= 3.3, p < 0.001). Post hoc  comparisons showed that clorgyline treatment decrease  Tcor (p 
< 0.01, Scheffe’s test) and paroxeti ne had no significant effects ( p > 0.05, Scheffe’s test). 
The maximal decreases in Tcor induced by paroxetine and clorgyline were -0.8 ± 0.1 °C 
and -0.9 ± 0.1 °C, respectively. To further i nvestigate the time course of antidepressant 
treatment on Tcor, one-way ANOV A was run on each tim e point. These analyses indicated 
that antidepressants decreased the Tcor on the 1 to 3 and 4 hours after the drug injection.  47Post hoc  comparisons indicated that  paroxetine decreased the Tcor on the first 2 hours, 
while clorgyline inhibited the Tcor on the first 3 hour s after treatment. This suggests that 
antidepressants when used alone can cause a decrease in Tcor. The effect may be due to 
activation of the 5-HT 1A receptor in drug-naïve animals. 
Figure 9b showed that chronic clorgylin e treatment induced a time-dependent 
increase in Tcor. This conclusion was confirmed by two-way repeated measures ANOV A, 
which revealed a significant effect of treatment (F 2, 17 = 16.7, p < 0.001), time (F 7, 119 = 
21.0, p < 0.001) and treatment × time (F 14, 119 = 24.5, p < 0.001). Post hoc  comparisons 
showed, compared with CLG + PRX group, both 3- and 6-day CLG pretreatment groups 
increased Tcor (p < 0.001, Scheffe’s test). There was no difference of Tcor between 3-day 
and 6-day CLG pretreatment groups ( p > 0.05, Scheffe’s test). To further investigate the 
time course of antidep ressant treatment on Tcor, one-way ANOV A was run on each time 
point. These analyses indicat ed that 3- and 6-day clor gyline treatment altered the Tcor on 
the 6 hours after the drug injec tion to the drug-naïve animals. Post hoc  comparisons 
indicated that 3-day clorgy line treatment increased the Tcor on the 6 hours after drug. 
While 6-day clorgyline treatment increased the Tcor on the first 3 hours after drug 
challenge. As shown in Figure 9b of the line wi th open cycle, the injection decreased the 
Tcor. The lowest Tcor is -1.38 ± 0.32 °C. The effect may be due to activation of the 5-HT 1A 
receptor in drug-naïve animals. Paroxetine co mbined with clorgyline caused a greater 
decrease in Tcor than each drug alone was examined. Th e effect was relevant to the mild 
syndrome in drug-naïve animals. This suggests that the mild syndrome is associated with 
hypothermia. After 3- or 6-day clorgyline trea tments, challenge injection of paroxetine 
combined with clorgyline on day 4 or 7 induced hyperthermia. The maximal increases in  48Tcor were 2.42 ± 0.41 °C and 2.95 ± 0.26 °C, respectively. The syndrome became severe. 
These data appears that chronic clorgylin e treatment increases the activity of 5-HT 2A 
receptor as demonstrated by the hyperthermia and syndrome severity.  
 
Effects of ketanserin on the hypert hermia and mortality of the 5-HT 
syndrome animals 
To verify 5-HT 2A receptors mediated the hyperthermia as well as the fatality, 
severe 5-HT syndrome animals received a pret reatment of ketanserin, a selective 5-HT 2A 
receptor antagonist. Systemic administration of  ketanserin affected the hyperthermia. 
This conclusion was confirmed by two-way re peated measures ANOV A, which revealed 
the significant effect of treatment (F 2, 17 = 37.1, p < 0.001), time (F 8, 136 = 8.2, p < 0.001) 
and treatment × time (F 16, 136  = 22.4, p < 0.001). Post hoc  analyses showed ketanserin 
pretreatment blocked the hyperthermia  of the 5-HT syndrome animals ( p < 0.001, 
Scheffe’s test). To further investigate th e time course of ketanserin treatment on Tcor, 
one-way ANOV A was run on each time point. Thes e analyses indicated that ketanserin 
altered the Tcor after its injection. Post hoc  comparisons indicated that ketanserin 
decreased the Tcor for 7 hours after its administration. 
Consistent with the work as described pr eviously (Nisijima et  al., 2001), systemic 
ketanserin blocked the hypertherm ia and prevented the fatality ( p < 0.05, Fisher’s exact 
test, 2-sided) of the severe 5- HT syndrome animals (Fig. 10).  
 
  49Effects of WAY-100635 and 8-OH-DPAT on the Tcor of the 5-HT syndrome 
animals  
Besides the 5-HT 2A receptor-mediated hyperthermia, the 5-HT 1A receptor-mediated 
hypothermia has also been reported in the 5-HT syndrome animals (Pranzatelli and Pluchino, 1991; Ma et al., 2008) . Here , we explored the effect of 5-HT
1A receptor on the 
hypothermia observed in the 5-HT syndrome animals. As shown in Figure 11a, 1 mg/kg paroxetine combined with 2 mg/kg cl orgyline significantly decreased the T
cor on the first 
hour after the challenge in anim als with chronic clorgyline tr eatment to the vehicle group 
(p < 0.05, Scheffe’s test). WAY-100635, a 5-HT 1A receptor antagonist, reversed the 
decrease in Tcor in the mild 5-HT syndrome animals, but no statistical difference was 
found when compared with the control group ( p > 0.05, Scheffe’s test).  
The earlier studies have  suggested that 5-HT 1A receptor may be desensitized after 
chronic antidepressant treatment. It  is very possible that the 5-HT 1A receptor-mediated 
symptoms of the syndrome are to some extent  reduced. Figure 11b indicated that chronic 
clorgyline treatment alleviat ed the 8-OH-DPAT (a 5-HT 1A receptor agonist)-induced 
hypothermia. This conclusion was confirmed by two-way repeated measures ANOV A, which revealed the significant effect of treatment (F
1, 4 = 48.4, p < 0.01), time (F 4, 16 = 
47.3, p < 0.001) and treatment × time (F 4, 16 = 5.575, p < 0.01). To further investigate the 
time course of chronic clorgyline treatment on Tcor, one-way ANOV A was run on each 
time point. These analyses indicated that ch ronic clorgyline inhibited the hypothermia on 
the 30, 60 and 90 min after 8-OH-DPAT challe nge. The data supports the hypothesis. 
 
  505-HT level in the mPFC and POA in th e 5-HT syndrome animals with acute or 
chronic clorgyline treatments 
An excessive increase in brain 5-HT efflux would induce the 5-HT syndrome 
(Zhang et al., 2009). Here extracellular 5-HT in the mPFC and POA in response to clorgyline and paroxetine challenge was test ed. The basal concentr ation of 5-HT from 
mPFC in drug-naïve, 3- and 6-day clorgylin e-treated animals were 1.1 ± 0.1 pg/sample ( n 
= 33), 3.6 ± 0.4 pg/sample ( n = 16) and 3.8 ± 0.4 pg/sample ( n = 12), respectively. It 
appears that repeated treatment with clorgylin e increases the basal 5-HT concentration as 
demonstrated by one-way ANOV A (F
2, 58 = 39.3, p < 0.001) (Fig.12a). Compared with 
naïve animal group, there was a significant increase of 5-HT level in CLG chronic 
treatment groups ( p < 0.001, Scheffe’s test). There we re no differences between CLG × 
3d group and CLG × 6d group ( p > 0.05, Scheffe’s test). Challenge injection of 
paroxetine combined with cl orgyline did not cause a remarkable difference of 5-HT 
efflux in the mPFC between the acute and chronic animals. It was confirmed by the 
insignificant effect of treatment (F 2, 20 = 0.76, p > 0.05) and treatment × time (F 14, 140  = 
1.46, p > 0.05). A significant effect existed in time (F 7, 140 = 61.2, p < 0.001).  Post hoc 
comparisons did not reveal a significa nt difference among the three groups ( p > 0.05, 
Scheffe’s test). 
The basal 5-HT level from the POA in dr ug-naïve, 3- and 6-day clorgyline-treated 
animals were 0.8 ± 0.1 pg/sample ( n = 34), 3.4 ± 0.4 pg/sample ( n = 15) and 4.0 ± 0.6 
pg/sample ( n = 10), respectively. One-way ANOV A de monstrated that chronic clorgyline 
treatment affected the baseline of 5-HT level in the POA (F 2, 56 = 47.7, p < 0.001) (Fig. 
12c). Compared with naïve animal group, ther e was a significant increase of 5-HT level  51in CLG chronic treatment groups ( p < 0.001, Scheffe’s test). There were no differences 
between CLG × 3d group and CLG × 6d group ( p > 0.05, Scheffe’s test). Although 
caused a remarkable increase, challenge in jection of clorgyline and paroxetine had no 
effect on the maximal 5-HT efflux in the PO A of animals treated with 0, 3- and 6-day 
repeated clorgyline treatment. It was confir med by the insignificant effect of treatment 
(F2, 12 = 0.437, p > 0.05), but time (F 7, 84 = 61.4, p < 0.001) and treatment × time (F 14, 84 = 
1.588, p > 0.05) have significances. Post hoc  comparisons did not reveal a significant 
difference among the three groups ( p > 0.05, Scheffe’s test) (Fig. 12d). In other words, 
the increase in 5-HT was similar between acu te and chronic clorgyl ine-treated animals. 
Altogether, despite previously clorgylin e pretreatment, paroxetine and clorgyline 
challenge had no effect on the maximal 5-HT efflux in the mPFC and POA. This suggests that, in addition to the role of excessive 5-HT in the 5-HT syndrome, other mechanism 
must be involved in the severity of 5-HT  syndrome. For this reason, it suggests that 
changes in 5-HT
2A receptor activity may be the unde rlying mechanism responsible for 
exacerbation of the syndrome severity after pret reatment with chronic clorgyline for 3 or 
6 days, which will be described further below. 
To extend the finding, changes in 5-HT in  drug-naïve animals in response to a 
single acute injection of pa roxetine or clorgyline was examined. Similar to those 
described previously in l iterature (Hervas et al., 2 000; Hervas and Artigas, 1998), 
clorgyline or paroxetine alone changed 5-HT  level in mPFC as demonstrated by the 
significant effect of treatment (F 2,16 =17.7, p < 0.001), time (F 7,122 = 7.9, p < 0.001) and 
treatment × time (F 14,122 = 4.9, p < 0.001). Post hoc  comparisons showed paroxetine 
increased 5-HT efflux ( p < 0.01, Scheffe’s test). There was no different between vehicle  52group and clorgyline group ( p > 0.05, Scheffe’s test) (Fig. 12 e). To further investigate the 
time course of antidepressant treatment on 5-HT level, one-way ANOV A was run on each 
time point. These analyses indicated that antidepressants altered 5-HT level  on the 6 
hours after the drug injection ( p < 0.01). Post hoc  comparisons indicated that paroxetine 
increase 5-HT level on the 6 hours after its injection ( p < 0.05). Similarly, clorgyline or 
paroxetine alone could signifi cantly alter 5-HT level in POA as demonstrated by the 
significant effect of treatment (F 2, 14 =17.3, p < 0.001), time (F 7, 98 = 3.9, p < 0.001) and 
treatment × time (F 14, 98 = 4.3, p < 0.001). Post hoc  comparisons showed both paroxetine 
and clorgyline increased 5-HT efflux in POA ( p < 0.01, Scheffe’s test) (Fig. 12f). To 
further investigate the time course of antid epressant treatment on 5-HT level, one-way 
ANOV A was run on each time point. These analys es indicated that antidepressants altered 
5-HT level  on the first 5 hours afte r the drug injection ( p < 0.05). Post hoc  comparisons 
indicated that paroxetine increased 5-HT level 5 hour s after its injection ( p < 0.05) and 
clorgyline increased 5-HT level on the 4th hour ( p < 0.05). 
In summary, paroxetine or clorgyline alone  can only cause a 1-3 fold increase. In 
contrast, combined injection of paroxetin e with clorgyline induces about 80 fold 
increases in 5-HT efflux. The severity of 5-HT syndrome is determined not only by the 
excessive 5-HT in the CNS, but also 5-HT 2A receptor activity that can be enhanced by 
chronic antidepressant treatment. 
 
Changes in head shakes in the animal s with acute or chronic clorgyline 
treatment  
Head shake is a characterist ic behavior mediated by 5-HT 2A receptor (Backus et al.,  531990). In this study, the number of head shakes was counted on the first hour after 
paroxetine and clorgyline challenge. The number of head shakes in naïve, 3- and 6-day 
clorgyline-treated animals were  29 ± 4, 35 ± 7 and 20 ± 5 times per hour to the challenge 
injection, respectively. Chronic clorgyline tr eatment did not alter the number of head 
shakes in rats as demonstrated by a one-way ANOV A (F 2, 16 = 2.228, p > 0.05).  Post hoc 
comparisons did not reveal any si gnificant difference between groups ( p > 0.05) (Fig. 
13a).  
It appears that the head shake da ta are inconsistent with the 5-HT 2A receptor 
hypothesis, in which it was expected that head  shake frequency would be increased in the 
clorgyline pretreated animals. It has been sugge sted that muscle rigidity can restrict the 
head shakes in the 5-HT syndrome animals (M a et al., 2008). To prev ent the interference 
from muscle activity, DOI, a 5-HT 2A receptor agonist, was used to  induce the head shakes. 
As shown in Figure 13b, DOI (1 mg/kg, s.c.) si gnificantly increased the number of head 
shakes in animals with repeated clorgyline treatment when compared with the control 
group (F = 6.669,  p < 0.05) (Fig. 13b).  
 
Effects of chronic clorgyline treatment on the mortality of the 5-HT syndrome 
animals 
Although death is not always the endpoint  of 5-HT syndrome, it is crucially 
indicative of the syndrome from benign to ma lignancy (Nisijima et al., 2001). No animals 
receiving saline ( n = 7), clorgyline ( n = 6) or paroxetine ( n = 6) died (data not shown). As 
shown in Table 8, chronic clor gyline treatment increased the mortality rate of the 5-HT 
syndrome animals with paroxetine and clor gyline challenge. Because some data have  54expected count less than five, Fisher’s ex act test replaced Pe arson Chi-Square for 
statistics here. Both 3-day and 6-day repeated  clorgyline treatment increased the mortality 
to the paroxetine and clorgyline challenge ( p < 0.05, Fisher’s exact test, 2-sided). The 
increase was blocked by the 5-HT 2A receptor antagonist ketanser in in the concordance of 
the hypothesis that 5-HT 2A receptor activity was enhanced in the animals with chronic 
antidepressant treatment. 
 
  552.4 Discussion  
 
The main findings from the present studies  were that chronic clorgyline treatment 
increased the 5-HT 2A receptor activity in the 5-HT syndrome animals as demonstrated by 
the rise in Tcor, head shakes and mortality. Additio nally, chronic clorgyline treatment 
attenuated 5-HT 1A receptor response, which, on the other hand, potentiated the activity of 
the 5-HT 2A receptor. 
To explore the mechanisms underlying the 5-HT syndrome, researchers have 
developed several animal models by increasi ng the extracellular 5-HT concentration in 
the brain (Table 9). The most popular drug paradigm employed is administration of 
5-HTP with an antidepressant to drug-naïve animals. This 5-HT syndrome animal model 
undoubtedly imitates some profile s of the clinical patien ts, such as behavioral 
hyperactivities, autonomic dysfunction as well as neurochemistry ch anges (Finberg, 1995; 
Turner et al., 2006; Ma et al ., 2008; Shioda et al., 2004). Neve rtheless, some defects exist. 
First, clinic cases have a l ong history of taking antidepressants before suffering from this 
syndrome (Boyer and Shannon, 2005). Many stud ies have revealed that chronic 
antidepressant treatment could increase ex tracellular 5-HT baselin e and change 5-HT 
receptor responses (Scott and Crews, 1986; Lanteri et al., 2009; Savage et al., 1980), 
which could not be replicated  in the drug-naïve animals. Therefore, the etiological 
mechanism underlying the patients with a long history of disease and results from acute 
5-HT syndrome animal models maybe be diff erent. Second, 5-HTP, a precursor of 5-HT, 
can increase the brain extracellular 5-HT le vel up to 1,000 times to the baseline with 
MAOI. Such a high level of 5-HT was never reported in human cases. Thus, developing a  56chronic animal model with appropriate dr ug regimen is imperative for the 5-HT 
syndrome research. Indeed, Speiser et al. (2008) developed a chronic 5-HT syndrome 
model by repeated injection of a MAOI and SSRI. Some mild symptoms of the 5-HT 
syndrome were observed in the animals, but hyp erthermia and death failed to occur even 
if high dose of the MAOI and SSRI were introdu ced. It appears that such a model is not a 
good candidate. To our best knowledge, an acceptable, convenient model for the 5-HT syndrome is unavailable before this study, wh ich has impeded the progress toward better 
understanding of this disorder . In this study, a novel 5-HT  syndrome animal model was 
developed. Considering co-administration of MAOIs and SSRIs was the most common 
cause that evoked the 5-HT syndrome in cl inic reports showing that 5 of 50 major 
depressed patients who received the co-presc ription of a MAOI and a SSRI developed 
severe adverse events (Boyer and Shannon, 2005; Hawley et al., 1996), clorgyline, a 
MAOI, and paroxetine, a SSRI, were used to  develop the syndrome. Animals received 
clorgyline for days to imitate the chronic cour se of treatment in human. On the last day, 
rats were challenged with paroxetine at  the same time as clorgyline injection. Our 
preliminary studies have demonstrated that this animal model has similar symptoms and 
pathophysiological profiles as human cases, whic h indicates that this model is a suitable 
candidate for 5-HT syndrome research. With this  animal model, we examined the role of 
the 5-HT
2A receptor in the etiology of the syndrome.    
Our data indicated that challenge injec tion of paroxetine induced hyperthermia and 
other symptoms relevant to severe syndrom e in the chronic clorgyline-treated animals 
(Fig. 9b). It is worthwhile to mention that hyperthermia is a pivotal manifestation of the 
severe 5-HT syndrome patients and precedent to  the fatality (Isbister et al., 2007). In  57animal models, however, the severity of s yndrome can be easily determined according to 
Tcor responses (Ma et al., 2008; Speiser et al., 2008). Hypothermia is related to a mild 
syndrome and hyperthermia is seen in se vere cases (Ma et al., 2008). It is 
well-established that 5-HT exerts the dual effects on the Tcor by acting on different 
receptors. Activating 5-HT 1A receptors induces hypothermia in rodents (Myers, 1975; 
Faure et al., 2006; Hjorth, 1985;  Lin and Chuang, 2002; Hedlund et al., 2004; Lin et al., 
1998). While stimulating 5-HT 2A receptor induces hypertherm ia (Faure et al., 2006; 
Hjorth, 1985; Lin and Chua ng, 2002; Hedlund et al., 2004; Gudelsky et al., 1986). 
Therefore, the increase in Tcor can be used to evaluate the activity of the 5-HT 2A receptor 
in vivo as well as the severity of the 5-HT syndrome (Gowing et al., 2002; Nisijima et al., 
2000, 2004). As shown in Figure 9b, paroxeti ne and clorgyline challenge induced 
hypothermia in drug-naïve animals, but pr ovoked hyperthermia in rats with chronic 
clorgyline treatment. Although the excessive incr ease in the extracellu lar 5-HT level is 
strongly associated with induction of the s yndrome, the severity of the syndrome is 
apparently not determined by the level of 5-HT in the CNS. In support, we measured 5-HT levels in each group and found no difference of the absolute 5-HT level existed between the mild and severe 5-HT syndrom e animals (Fig. 12). One corollary of the 
present study is that chronic clorgy line increased the activity of 5-HT
2A receptor. The 
conclusion was further confirmed by data in Fi gure 2.4 which stated that ketanserin could 
blocked the hyperthermia of the syndrome animal.  
In a 5-HT syndrome animal model induced by clorgyline and 5-HTP, animals 
started displaying hyperthermia as the brain 5-HT level beyond 30-fold to the baseline 
(Zhang et al., 2009). However, co-adminis tration of clorgylin e and paroxetine in  58drug-naïve animals decreased the Tcor with a fold increase in brain 5-HT beyond 60 times 
greater than the baseline. The conflicting results  may attribute to the different agents used 
because 5-HTP can provide extrinsic 5-HT to any region with 5-HTP docarboxylase, while paroxetine and clorgyline increase 5-HT only in the regions with serotonergic axon 
terminals.  
Interestingly, we noticed that clorgy line combined with paroxetine induced 
hypothermia in drug-naïve animals (Fig. 9a). In  a previous study, we found that less than 
10-fold increase in brain extracel lular 5-HT could decrease the T
cor via activating 5-HT 1A 
receptor (Zhang et al., 2009). It suggests that the 5-HT 1A receptor is activated 
predominately. In agreement with this, our  data also verified that WAY-100635, a 5-HT 1A 
receptor antagonist, reduced the hypothermia. Unfortunately, no statistical difference was 
found (Fig. 11). In a previous study, it was found that WAY-100635 produced the 
maximal effect around 30 to 45 minutes after injection (Ma et al., 2008), but the data we 
collected in this study was one hour later after WAY-100635 exposure. The difference of 
time point may account for the statistical results. 
The changes in Tcor observed in the 5-HT syndrome animals involve 5-HT 1A and 
5-HT 2A receptors. Under room temperature, the affinity of 5-HT 1A receptor to 5-HT is 
1000 times higher than 5-HT 2A receptor (Dalpiaz et al., 199 5). Hence, the mild increase 
in extracellular 5-HT will induce hypothermia first by acting on 5-HT 1A receptors. When 
5-HT increases to a certain level, 5-HT 2A receptors will be stimulated and hyperthermia 
will appear. The interaction between the 5-HT 1A receptor, if not all, and the 5-HT 2A 
receptor keeps the Tcor in a normal range. The neural targets that mediate the 
thermoregulation by 5-HT was also explored. Lin et al. (1998) found that excitation of  595-HT 2A or 5-HT 1A receptors in the POA, a pivotal center of thermoregulation (Boulant, 
1981), could induce hyperthermia and hypothermia , respectively. Consistently, our data 
showed that 5-HT level in the POA increase d. It suggests that POA may severe as the 
target that mediates the ther moregulation mediated by the 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A receptors.  
 Another finding in this study was that chronic clorgyline treatment attenuated 
8-OH-DPAT (a 5-HT 1A receptor agonist)-induced hypothermia  (Fig. 11b). It suggests that 
the 5-HT 1A receptor activity on  Tcor is desensitized after repeated clorgyline treatment. 
Paralleled with our study, chronic antidepr essant treatment (e.g., tranylcypromine, 
zimeldine, desipramine) could desensitize the 5-HT 1A receptor and attenuate the 
hypothermia provoked by 8-OH-DPAT (Goodwin  et al., 1987; Lanteri et al., 2009). 
Likewise, chronic buspirone, a partial 5-HT 1A receptor agonist, treatment decreased 
5-HT 1A mRNA level in some brain regi ons (Chen et al., 1995). The 5-HT 1A receptor has 
an opposite role to the 5-HT 2A receptor in regulating th e body temperature action. 
Therefore, the desensitization of the 5-HT 1A receptor, on the other hand, may potentiate 
the hyperthermia and other activities mediated by the 5-HT 2A receptor.  
Head shake is a characterist ic behavior mediated by 5-HT 2A receptor (Peroutka et 
al., 1981). Our study showed that paroxetine and clorgyline challenge could evoke the 
head shakes in the drug-naïve and chroni c clorgyline-treated an imals (Fig.13a). It 
suggests the 5-HT 2A receptor is activated in these scenarios. Theoretically, chronic 
clorgyline treatment could increase the number of  head shakes to the challenge injection 
in term of the sensitized 5-HT 2A receptor, however there was no relation between the 
number of head shakes and dur ation of clorgyline treatment observed. In a previous study, 
we found the intensified muscular activity c ould restrain the head shaking response (Ma  60et al., 2008). Indeed, repeated clorgyline treatment increased th e muscle rigidity in this 
study (data not shown), which might account for the response of head shakes. To 
eliminate the effect of muscle tone on the head shakes, DOI, a 5-HT 2A receptor agonist, 
substituted paroxetine and clorgyline challenge  to evoke head shakes in animals with 
repeated clorgyline treatment. DOI increased  the number of head shakes in chronic 
clorgyline-treated animals (Fig. 13b). A tentat ive explanation is that chronic clorgyline 
treatment increases the activity of 5-HT 2A receptor, in agreement with the 5-HT 2A 
receptor hypothesis.  
Head shake or head twitch is a behavior characterized by the rat’s shaking its head 
(not the whole body) in a short and firm way. Besides as a part of the natural behavioral 
repertoire in mammalian species, head shakes can be provoked by 5-HT 2A receptor 
agonists (e.g., DOI). Pharmacol ogically, head shakes are cons idered to be a stereotyped 
behavior that provides useful  information about the mechanisms of specific drugs, for 
example hallucinogens, and potential treatments.  The relation between the hallucination 
and head shakes induced by DOI has a close co nnection (Garcia et al., 2007). It suggests 
that head shaking behavior is not only a physical behavior but a symptom of mental 
activity. Indeed, there are ment al state changes in the 5-HT  syndrome patients (Boyer and 
Shannon, 2005). Therefore, head shakes may serv e as a indicator of the mental disorder. 
Head shaking behavior is the major behavior mediated by 5-HT 2A receptors and 
other behaviors (e.g., tremor, forepa w treading) are mediated by 5-HT 1A receptors 
(Yamada et al., 1988). It is necessary and relati vely easy to monitor he ad shakes and, also, 
it is interesting to test the other 5-HT syndr ome behaviors. However, the other behaviors 
were not related to the hypothesi s, so they were not included.  61Our data in this study revealed that ch ronic clorgyline treatment increased the 
mortality rate of the 5-HT s yndrome animals (Table 8). 5-HT 2A is responsible for the 
fatality of the syndrome animals (Nisijima et al., 2001; Ma et al., 2008). Both animal 
studies and clinic case reports ha ve confirmed that  blocking 5-HT 2A receptors could 
improve the survival rates of the 5-HT syndr ome subjects (Lappin and Auchincloss, 1994; 
Graudins et al., 1998; Nisijima et al., 2000, 2004). Therefore, the fatal ity can at least in 
part serve as a criterion to evaluate the activity of 5-HT 2A receptor in the malignant 
syndrome. In this study, chronic clorgyline tr eatment increased the mortality significantly 
(Table 8) without a dramatic increase in brain 5-HT level (F ig. 12). It appears that 5-HT 
level is a causative but not a decisive factor to the death of the 5-HT syndrome animals. 
Given the 5-HT 2A receptor is responsible for the mortality of the syndrome, a tentative 
explanation in favor of this result is that the increased activity of 5-HT 2A receptors to 
chronic clorgyline treatment is resp onsible for the malignant response. 
The variation of the 5-HT 2A receptor activity to MAOI treatment has been the focus 
of many studies in the past decades. Some in vivo studies  stated the chronic MAOI 
treatment decreased 5-HT 2A receptor density (Todd et al., 1995), however others reported 
chronic MAOI increased 5-HT 2A receptor activity (Lanteri et al., 2009). In vitro studies 
also revealed that 5-HT 2A receptor agonist had inconsistent effects on the receptor 
binding capacity, and gene expression (Table 3) . This discrepancy of the studies suggests 
that the change of 5-HT 2A receptor activity depends on the cell milieu, the agents selected 
as well as the span of drug treatmen t (Grotewiel and Sanders-Bush, 1994).  
In summary, the data of the present study indicate that chronic clorgyline treatment 
increases 5-HT 2A activity in a 5-HT syndrome animal model developed by clorgyline and  62paroxetine. The sensitization of 5-HT 2A receptor may account for the occurrence of the 
5-HT syndrome in patients with chronic anti depressant treatment. Additionally, our data 
revealed that repeated clorgyline exposure desensitizes 5-HT 1A receptors, which may 
potentiate the activity of 5-HT 2A receptor indirectly.   63

CHAPTER THREE: EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURE ON 
THE SEVERITY OF SEROTONIN SYNDROME EVOKED BY CHALLENGE 
INJECTION OF PAROXETINE CO MBINED WITH CLORGYLINE 
 3.1 Introduction  
The effects of cold and warm ambient te mperature on the toxic responses induced 
by serotonin-selective psychotropic drugs ha ve been well-documented. Animal studies 
indicated that cold ambient temperature could decrease methamphetamine (a 5-HT releaser)-induced hyperthermia, neuron damage  and death in mice (Ali et al., 1994; Gunn 
and Thoresen, 2006). In contrast, warm envi ronmental temperature could potentiate the 
toxicity evoked by methamphetamine a nd its derivates [e.g., 3,4-methylenedioxy 
methamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy)] (M alberg and Seiden, 1998; Miller and 
O'Callaghan, 2003; Bowyer et al., 1994). Consis tently, a retrospective review of Medical 
Examiners’ cases from 1990 through 1995 in New York City revealed that the mean daily 
number of cocaine or opiate (5-HT releasers) overdose deat hs was significantly higher on 
hot days (Marzuk et al., 1998). These data  suggest that warm and cold ambient 
temperature aggravates and alleviates the to xic responses induced by 5-HT, respectively. 
Likely, ambient temperature influences the prognosis of the 5-HT syndrome subjects. As described in previous literature (Mille r and O'Callaghan, 2003), studies from our lab 
revealed that warm ambient temperature (32° C) potentiated hyperthermia and mortality  84of the 5-HT syndrome animals developed by clorgyline and 5-HTP. On the contrary, cold 
ambient temperature (12°C) reversed the hype rthermia and prevented fatality. Clinically, 
cold measures have been employed widely to  alleviate 5-HT syndrome patients (Ener et 
al., 2003). The mechanisms behind the ambien t temperature on 5-HT syndrome have not 
been fully elucidated yet.  
In the previous chapter, data verified that 5-HT 2A receptor mediated the 
hyperthermia and mortality of the 5-HT syndr ome animals. Interestingly, hyperthermia 
and death could also be observed in animal s taken therapeutic dose of proserotonergic 
agents and housed in warm ambient temp erature. Recently, a pilot study in our lab 
revealed that ketanserin, a 5-HT 2A receptor antagonist, blocked the hyperthermia and 
prevented death of the 5-HT syndrome animals housed in warm environment. Given that 
increase in environmental temperature raise the affinity of 5-HT 2A receptor (Dalpiaz et al., 
1995), it appears that the 5-HT 2A receptor serves as a pivotal  candidate that bridges the 
ambient temperature and severity of the 5-HT syndrome, but little evidence is available to 
date. 
The aim of this chapter was to explore th e effect of different ambient temperature 
on the activity of 5-HT 2A receptor in the 5-HT syndrome animals developed by 
paroxetine and clorgyline as well as in naïv e animals. Since warm ambient temperature 
increased the MDMA-induced  toxicity (Malberg and Seiden, 1998; Miller and 
O'Callaghan, 2003; Bowyer et al., 1994) , we hypothesized that warm ambient 
temperature could increase the 5-HT 2A receptor activity, resulting in a aggravated 5-HT 
syndrome. On the contrary, cold ambient te mperature could inhibit the activity of 5-HT 2A 
receptor and thereafter alleviate the severe syndrome animals.        853.2 Materials and methods 
Animal preparation, chemicals and schedul e for injection, preparation of 5-HT 
syndrome animal model, core body temperatur e measurement, surgery, microdialysis 
procedures, histological iden tification and data analysis were identical with those 
described in chapter two. 
 
Behavioral score 
On the day of testing, animals were transferred to a transparent bowl and 
habituated it for 2 h before drug administ ration. Syndrome behaviors examined included 
tremor, forepaw treading, hindlimb abduction, St raub tail and immobility. Each behavior, 
rated on a scale of mild (score 1), moderate (score 2) and severe (score 3) (Ma et al., 
2008), was assessed once per hour for six consecutive hours af ter clorgyline and 
paroxetine administration. The scores from the six one-hour periods were averaged to 
represent each syndrome intensity. The behavior al score was the sum of the six averaged 
scores. Thus, the behavioral scor e ranges from 0 to 15 (Table 10). 
 
Thermostatic chamber 
The thermostatic chamber was built as  described previously with little 
modification (Malberg and Seiden, 1998). In br ief, the chamber was made of transparent 
polyethylene with dimension of 100 × 60 ×80 cm. Heat insulation was placed on the 5 
sides of the chamber with door left. A polyet hylene plate with 6 holes was used a door.  
A temperature controller (Fisher Scientific) regulated the chamber temperature by control 
a heater or an air conditioner. The air in th e chamber is circulated by two fans (Fig. 14).  863.3 Results  
 Effects of warm (32 °C) or cold (12 °C) T
amb on the Tcor of the moderate 5-HT 
syndrome animals 
Our preliminary data indicated that anim als previously receiving daily clorgyline 
(2 mg/kg) for 3 days displayed profiles of  a moderate 5-HT syndrome in the standard 
Tamb (22 °C) on day 4 following 2 mg/kg clorgy line and 5 mg/kg paroxetine challenge. 
This experimental paradigm was exclusively ad opted here to examine the effect of other 
Tamb on the 5-HT 2A receptor activity. As described in th e earlier studies, animals used here 
have previously received daily 2 mg/kg clorgy line pretreatment for 3 consecutive days at 
the standard Tamb of 22 °C. On the 4th day, animals habituated in chambers with different 
Tamb at least two hours before st arting recording. The baseline Tcor of rats in cold (12 °C), 
standard (22 °C) and warm (32 °C) Tamb was 38.2 ± 0.1 °C ( n = 16), 37.7 ± 0.2°C ( n = 10) 
and 38.3 ± 0.1 °C ( n = 12), respectively. One-way ANO V A demonstrated a significant 
effect of the altered Tamb on basal Tcor (F2, 35 = 5.032, p < 0.05). Post hoc comparisons 
showed that the warm Tamb elevated the baseline Tcor (p < 0.05, Scheffe’s test). 
Interestingly, basal Tcor was not significantl y altered at cold Tamb (p > 0.05, Scheffe’s test) 
(Fig. 15a).  
To examine changes in the 5-HT 2A receptor activity in the different Tamb, the Tcor of 
the 5-HT syndrome animals was measured. Cons istent with the previously findings, the 
Tcor of the  moderate syndrome animals stayed in a normal range (normothermia) at the 
standard Tamb (22 °C) . In contrast,  as shown in Figure 15b, cold (12 °C) and warm (32 °C) 
Tamb had significant effect on the Tcor as demonstrated by the significant effect of  87treatment (F 2, 18 = 98.3, p < 0.001), time (F 4, 72 = 7.8, p < 0.001) and treatment × time (F 8, 
72 = 30.8, p < 0.05). Post hoc  comparisons showed that warm  Tamb significantly increased 
the Tcor compared with room Tamb (p < 0.01, Scheffe’s test). There was no difference in  
Tcor between the room Tamb group and cold Tamb group ( p > 0.05, Scheffe’s test). To 
further examine the time course of Tamb on Tcor, one-way ANOV A was run on each time 
point. These analyses indicated that Tamb altered Tcor on the first three hours after drug 
challenge ( p < 0.05). Post hoc  comparisons indicated that only warm Tamb increased the 
Tcor to the room Tamb after drug challenge. Because all the moderate 5-HT syndrome 
animals housed in the warm (32 °C) environment without a 5-HT 2A receptor antagonist 
pretreatment died within 6 hours after chal lenge injection, so only part of the body 
temperature data were shown. 
Same as previous reports that keta nserin could block the 5-HTP-induced 
hyperthermia of the 5-HT syndrome animals in room Tamb (Nisijima et al., 2001), 
ketanserin had significant effect on the change of Tcor in warm Tamb (Fig. 15c) here as 
demonstrated by the significant effect of treatment (F 2, 16 = 158.2, p < 0.001), time (F 5, 80 
= 17.3, p < 0.001) and treatment × time (F 10, 80 = 68.9, p < 0.001). Post hoc  analysis 
showed ketanserin could signifi cantly block the hyperthermia ( p < 0.001, Scheffe’s test). 
To further examine the time course of Tamb on Tcor, one-way ANOV A was run on each 
time point. These analyses indicated  that ketanserin pretreatment  altered the Tcor after 
clorgyline and paroxetine challenge ( p < 0.001). Post hoc  comparisons indicated that 
ketanserin blocked the hyperthermia of the 5-HT animals housed on warm Tamb (p < 
0.001).  
Interestingly, ketanserin potentiated the hypothermic re sponse as the tests were  88carried out at cold Tamb (Fig. 15d) . Two-way repeated ANOV A showed that ketanserin had 
significant effect on the change of Tcor in cold Tamb as demonstrated by the significant 
effect of treatment (F 2, 16 = 158.5, p < 0.001), time (F 5, 80 = 17.3, p < 0.001) and treatment 
× time (F 10, 80 = 68.9, p < 0.001).  Post hoc  comparison showed ketanserin decreased Tcor 
(p < 0.001, Scheffe’s test). To further examine the time course of ketanserin on Tcor, 
one-way ANOV A was run on each time point. Thes e analyses indicated that ketanserin 
pretreatment  altered the Tcor (p < 0.001). Post hoc  comparisons indicated that ketanserin 
potentiated the hypothermia from 2 to 6 hours after clorgyline and pa roxetine challenge. 
It appears the 5-HT 2A receptor mediates the hyperthermia observed. 
 
Effects of Tamb on the DOI-induced increase in Tcor in drug-naïve animals 
The antidepressant data suggest  that the effects of 5-HT 2A receptor on the 5-HT 
syndrome depend on the Tamb. In support of this hypothesis, DOI, a 5-HT 2A receptor 
agonist, -induced increase in Tcor with drug-naïve animals housed in different Tamb was 
examined. As shown in Figure 16, DOI altered the Tcor in the standard Tamb of 22 °C  as 
demonstrated by the significant effect of treatment (F 3, 18 = 32.9, p < 0.001), time (F 7, 126 
= 11.0, p < 0.001) and treatment × time (F 21, 126  = 4.6, p < 0.001). The maximal increase 
in Tcor in response to 0.05, 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg DOI was 0.29 ± 0.08, 0.64 ± 0.06 and 0.79 
± 0.06 °C. Specifically, post hoc comparisons showed that 0.05 mg/kg DOI had no effects 
on Tcor (p > 0.05, Scheffe’s test). In contrast, 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg DOI enhanced Tcor (p < 
0.01, Scheffe’s test; Fig. 16a). To furthe r examine the time course of DOI on Tcor, 
one-way ANOV A was run on each time point. These analyses indicated that DOI  altered 
the Tcor on each time point after it injection ( p < 0.001). Post hoc  comparisons indicated  89that 0.1 mg/kg DOI enhanced  Tcor on the 30, 45 and 60 min. 0.5 mg/kg DOI increased Tcor 
on the 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 min. This effect  might be due to activation of 5-HT 2A 
receptor, which was supported by the observatio n that ketanserin completely blocked it 
(Fig. 16b). 
 5-HT 2A receptor antagonist blocks the increase in Tcor induced by DOI in the 
room Tamb. Two-way ANOV A showed a significant effect of treatment (F 3, 18 = 15.9, p < 
0.001) and treatment × time (F 24, 144 = 4.9, P < 0.001), but no difference in time (F 8, 144 = 
1.5, P > 0.05). Post hoc  comparisons showed ketanserin inhibited the increase in Tcor 
induced by DOI ( p < 0.001, Scheffe’s test).  To further examine the time course of 
ketanserin on DOI-mediated Tcor, one-way ANOV A was run on each time point. These 
analyses indicated that ketanserin  altered the Tcor on each time point after it injection ( p < 
0.05). Post hoc  comparisons indicated that keta nserin blocked the DOI enhanced  Tcor on 
the 45, 60, 75 and 90 min after DOI injection. 
Next, the effects of warm Tamb (32 °C) on the DOI-induced increase in Tcor were 
examined. Unsurprisingly, DOI enhanced the Tcor as demonstrated by the significant 
effect of treatment (F 3, 18 = 64.9, P < 0.001), time (F 7, 126 = 106.6, p < 0.001) and 
treatment × time (F 21, 126 = 30.6, p < 0.001). Post hoc  comparisons showed that 0.05 
mg/kg DOI had no effects on T cor (p > 0.05, Scheffe’s test), while 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg DOI 
both produced a signif icant increase in Tcor (p < 0.001, Scheffe’s test). To further examine 
the time course of DOI on Tcor, one-way ANOV A was run on each time point. These 
analyses indicated that DOI  altered the Tcor on each time point after it injection ( p < 
0.001). Post hoc  comparisons indicated that  0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg DOI enhanced  Tcor on 
each time point after DOI injection ( p < 0.05, Scheffe’s test). The maximal increase was  900.50 ± 0.09, 1.70 ± 0.25 and 2.71 ± 0.17 °C, respectiv ely, in response to 0.05, 0.1 and 0.5 
mg/kg DOI (Fig. 16c). The increases in Tcor at warm Tamb were significantly greater than 
those at standard Tamb (22 °C). Ketanserin blocked this  effect as demonstrated by the 
significant effect of treatment (F 3, 17 = 28.1, p < 0.001), time (F 8, 136 = 7.4, p < 0.001) and 
treatment × time (F 24, 136 = 19.3, p < 0.001). Post hoc  comparisons showed ketanserin 
pretreatment blocked DOI-mediated increase in  Tcor (p < 0.001, Scheffe’s test) (Fig. 3.3d). 
To further examine the time course of ketanserin on DOI-mediated hyperthermia, one-way ANOV A was run on each time point. Thes e analyses indicated that ketanserin
 
altered the Tcor on each time point after it injection ( p < 0.001). Post hoc  comparisons 
indicated that ketanserin  blocked the DOI enhanced  Tcor on the 30, 60 and 90 min after 
DOI injection ( p < 0.05, Scheffe’s test), sugges ting the involvement of 5-HT 2A receptor 
sensitization at warm Tamb. 
Finally, the effects of different Tamb on the 5-HT 2A receptor-mediated increase in 
Tcor were recorded. The basal (pre drug injection) Tcor was 38.08 ± 0.09 °C ( n = 12), 37.91 
± 0.04 °C ( n = 98), 37.33 ± 0.10 °C ( n = 12), 37.79 ± 0.03 °C ( n = 96) at the Tamb of 12 
°C, 22 °C, 27 °C and 32 °C (Fig. 16e). DOI produced a Tamb-dependent increase in Tcor. It 
was confirmed by two-way repeated measures  ANOV A showing the significant effect of 
treatment (F 3, 18 = 25.2, p < 0.001), time (F 7, 126 = 29.6, p < 0.001) and treatment × time 
(F21, 126 = 8.3, p < 0.001).  Post hoc  comparisons showed that 12 °C ( p < 0.05) and 32 °C 
(p < 0.01) inhibited and enhanced DOI-induced increase in Tcor, respectively. The 
maximal increase was 0.20 ± 0.07, 0.69 ± 0.06, 0.99 ± 0.13 and 1.45 ± 0.23 °C, respectively (Fig.16f).  
  91Effects on increases in 5-HT efflux  of warm (32 °C) or cold (12 °C) Tamb in the 
moderate syndrome animals 
Next, the changes in the extracellular 5-HT  level in mPFC and POA were tested to 
reveal the relationship between Tamb and the syndrome. The basal 5-HT levels in the 
mPFC (pg/sample) were 3.0 ± 0.3 ( n = 16), 3.4 ± 0.3 ( n = 10) and 4.9 ± 0.3 ( n = 20) at 
cold (12 °C), standard (22 °C) and warm (32 °C) Tamb. One-way ANOV A demonstrated 
that Tamb had effects on the basal 5-HT level (F 2, 41 = 8.5, p < 0.01). Compared with that 
at standard Tamb, the basal 5-HT was increased at warm Tamb (p < 0.05, Scheffe’s test). No 
difference was found between cold and standard Tamb (p > 0.05, Scheffe’s test). Challenge 
injection of paroxetine combin ed with clorgyline at warm Tamb caused a greater increase 
in 5-HT than that observed at the standard Tamb. It was confirmed by two-way repeated 
measures ANOV A showing the significant effect of treatment (F 2, 20 = 68.5, p < 0.001), 
time (F 5, 100 = 91.2, p < 0.001) and treatment × time (F 10, 100  = 32.995, p < 0.001). Post 
hoc comparisons showed warm Tamb enhanced 5-HT release ( p < 0.001, Scheffe’s test). 
There was no difference between the room Tamb group and cold Tamb group ( p > 0.05, 
Scheffe’s test) (Fig. 17a). To further examine the time course of Tamb on 5-HT efflux, 
one-way ANOV A was run on each time point . These analyses indicated that Tamb altered 
5-HT level on each time point after clorgyline and paroxetine injection ( p < 0.001). Post 
hoc comparisons indicated that warm Tamb enhanced 5-HT release on the first 3 hours 
after clorgyline and paroxetine challenge ( p < 0.05, Scheffe’s test). 
Next step was to examine a Tamb-dependent effect on POA 5-HT. Basal 5-HT 
(pg/sample) was 4.3 ± 0.3 ( n = 8) 3.4 ± 0.4 ( n = 15) and 5.3 ± 0.6 ( n = 8), respectively, at 
the cold, standard and warm Tamb. One-way ANOV A demonstrated  that basal 5-HT was  92also Tamb-related in this region (F 2, 27 = 3.7, p < 0.05). Paroxetine and clorgyline challenge 
produced a much greater 5-HT increase at warm Tamb than that at the standard 
experimental condition. It was confirmed by two-way repeated ANOV A showing the 
significant effect of treatment (F 2, 10 = 38.3, p < 0.001), time (F 5, 50 = 44.9, p < 0.001) and 
treatment × time (F 10, 50 = 15.7, p < 0.001). Similar to those happened in the mPFC, Post 
hoc analyses showed warm Tamb enhanced 5-HT release ( p < 0.001, Scheffe’s test). There 
was no significant differences of POA 5-HT between standard and cold Tamb (p > 0.05, 
Scheffe’s test) (Fig.17b).To further examine the time course of Tamb on 5-HT efflux, 
one-way ANOV A was run on each time point . These analyses indicated that Tamb altered 
5-HT level on each time point after clorgyline and paroxetine injection ( p < 0.05). Post 
hoc comparisons indicated that warm Tamb enhanced 5-HT release on the 2 and 3 hours 
after clorgyline and paroxetine challenge ( p < 0.01, Scheffe’s test). 
Lastly, a hypothesis that  the sensitized 5-HT 2A receptor accounted for the enhanced 
increase in 5-HT at warm Tamb was examined. In cold Tamb, ketanserin pretreatment 
altered 5-HT level in mPFC  as demonstrated by the signif icant effect of treatment (F 2, 14 = 
12.3, p < 0.01), time (F 8, 112 = 43.1, p < 0.001) and treatment × time (F 16, 112  = 8.9, p < 
0.001). Post hoc  comparisons showed ketanserin had no effect on 5-HT level in the 
mPFC ( p > 0.05, Scheffe’s test) (Fig. 17c). To further examine the time course of 
ketanserin on 5-HT efflux, one-way ANOV A was run on each time point. These analyses 
indicated that ketanserin a ltered 5-HT level on each time point after clorgyline and 
paroxetine injection ( p < 0.01). Post hoc  comparisons indicated th at ketanserin did not 
block 5-HT efflux ( p > 0.05, Scheffe’s test). 
In POA, ketanserin pretreatment also a ltered 5-HT level as demonstrated by the  93significant effect of treatment(F 2, 9 = 5.0, p < 0.05), time (F 8, 72 = 20.6, p < 0.001) and 
treatment × time (F 16, 72 = 4.6, p < 0.001). Post hoc  comparisons showed ketanserin had 
no effect on basal 5-HT in the POA ( p > 0.05, Scheffe’s test) (Fig. 17c). To further 
examine the time course of ketanserin on 5-HT efflux, one-way ANOV A was run on each 
time point. These analyses indicated that keta nserin altered 5-HT level from 2 to 6-hour 
after clorgyline and paroxetine injection ( p < 0.01). Post hoc  comparisons indicated that 
ketanserin did not block 5-HT ( p > 0.05, Scheffe’s test) (Fig. 17d). This suggests that 
chronic antidepressant treatment does not  alter the tonic activity of the 5-HT 2A receptor. 
Meanwhile, ketanserin at the warm Tamb significantly blocked the enhanced 
increase in 5-HT efflux in the mPFC (Fig. 17e ). It was confirmed by the significant effect 
of treatment (F 2, 17 = 70.4, p < 0.001), time (F 5, 85 = 102.6, p < 0.001) and treatment × 
time (F 10, 86 = 41.5,  p < 0.001). Post hoc  comparisons analyses showed that ketanserin 
significant inhibited 5-HT release ( p < 0.001, Scheffe’s test). To further examine the time 
course of ketanserin on 5-HT efflux, one-way  ANOV A was run on each time point. These 
analyses indicated that ketanserin altered 5-HT level after clorgyline and paroxetine 
injection ( p < 0.01). Post hoc  comparisons indicated that ke tanserin block increased 5-HT 
on the first 3 hours after clorgylin e and paroxetine challenge ( p < 0.05, Scheffe’s test). 
Similarly, ketanserin had significant effect on 5-HT efflux in the POA as 
demonstrated by the significant effect of treatment (F 2, 11 = 51.0, p < 0.001), treatment × 
time (F 10, 55 = 47.0, p < 0.001) and time (F 5, 55 = 102.5, p < 0.001). Post hoc  comparisons 
analyses showed that ketanserin si gnificantly inhibited 5-HT release ( p < 0.01, Scheffe’s 
test) (Fig. 17f). To further examine the time course of ketanserin on 5-HT efflux, one-way ANOV A was run on each time point. These analys es indicated that ketanserin altered  945-HT level after clorgyline  and paroxetine injection ( p < 0.01). Post hoc  comparisons 
indicated that ketanserin block 5-HT on th e third hour after clorgyline and paroxetine 
injection ( p < 0.001, Scheffe’s test). 
 
Effects on the head shakes and behavior al score of warm (32 °C) or cold (12 
°C) Tamb in the moderate syndrome animals 
Head shake is a characteristic behavior mediated through the 5-HT 2A receptor (Ma 
et al., 2008). Here the changes in Tamb on the 5-HT 2A receptor-mediated head shaking 
behavior was examined. As described in th e early study, animals had received chronic 
clorgyline pretreatment at the standard expe rimental condition for 3 days before the 
experiment. On day 4, the animals were random ly assigned into warm, standard or cold 
Tamb chambers for head shaking tests. The ch allenge injection was 5 mg/kg paroxetine 
combined with 2 mg/kg clorgyline. As shown in Figure 18, the number of head shakes in 
response to the drug challenge was significantly altered in a Tamb-dependent manner as 
demonstrated by one-way ANOV A (F 2, 16 = 4.8, p < 0.05). Specifically, the intensity of 
head shakes was significantly reduced at warm Tamb (p < 0.01, Scheffe’s test) but not at 
cold Tamb (p > 0.05, Scheffe’s test; Fig. 18a). It wa s not very surprising that the head 
shaking behavior was reduced in the warm  condition. As described earlier, such 
behavioral intensity can be affected by muscular  activity in the syndrome. That is to say, 
the head shaking intensity would be reduced  if the syndrome severity were increased. 
To test this hypothesis that mu scular rigidity restrained the head shaking behaviors, 
the changes in the syndrome behaviors were recorded by scaling tremor, forepaw treading, 
hindlimb abduction, immobility and Straub tail. C onsistent with the hypothesis, as shown  95in Figure 18b, behavioral scores we re markedly increased at warm Tamb (p < 0.001, 
Scheffe’s test). No explanation that the scores were also to small extent increased at cold 
Tamb (p < 0.01, Scheffe’s test) (Fig. 18b).  
Finally, it was hypothesized th at the activity of 5-HT 2A receptors accounted for the 
effect of warm Tamb on the head shaking behavior and behavioral scores. The 5-HT 2A 
receptor antagonist ketanserin was used to test this possibility. In the cold Tamb, the head 
shakes were significantly reduced in animals pretreated with keta nserin prior to the 
challenge injection as demonstrated by independent-samples T-test (F = 7.2, p < 0.05) 
(Fig. 18c), but ketanserin had no effect on the behavioral score as demonstrated by 
independent-samples T-test (F = 0.312, p > 0.05) (Fig. 18d). In the warm Tamb, ketanserin 
significantly decreased the number of head shakes as demonstrated by 
independent-samples T-test (F = 7.9, p < 0.05) (Fig. 18e) and behavioral score (F = 7.193, 
p < 0.05) (Fig. 18f). 
 
Effects on the syndrome mortality of  warm (32 °C) or cold (12 °C) Tamb in the 
moderate syndrome animals 
Pathologically, a moderate syndrome at the standard condition should not result in 
death. Mortality can be alte red, depending on the external environmental conditions, 
particularly ambient temperature. Thus, th e hypothesis that mortality rate may be 
increased at warm Tamb was examined. Data were summar ized in Table 11. Specifically, 
no death occurred in the moderate syndrome evoked by 5 mg/kg paroxetine combined 
with clorgyline at the standard Tamb. In contrast, the same dose injection however at warm 
Tamb caused 100% death. This effect was blocke d by ketanserin, suggesting that the death  96associated with the syndrome at warm Tamb was mediated by the enhanced activity of 
5-HT 2A receptor which in concordance with the principal hypothesis.  
 
Effects on Tcor and fatality of cold Tamb (12 °C) of the severe syndrome animals 
Clinical reports have indicated that co ld measures could alleviate the severe 
syndrome (Ener et al., 2003). It appears that the effect may be ascribed to reduction in 
5-HT 2A receptor activity, which has not been addressed in the earlier clinical or 
preclinical investigations. Fo r aforementioned reason, the c ooling effect on the severe 
syndrome animals in my animal study was studi ed. At the standard lab temperature of 22 
°C, 15 mg/kg paroxetine in combination of 2 mg/kg clorgyline was sufficient to cause a 
severe syndrome on day 4 in animals receiving chronic clorgyline for 3 days. With knowledge in mind, following experiment was designed. After daily clorgyline 
pretreatment for 3 days, 5 animals were examined on day 4 at standard T
amb of 22 °C and 
the rest of 4 at cold Tamb of 12 °C. As shown in Figur e 19a, challenge injection of 
paroxetine combined with clorgylin e caused hyperthermia at standard Tamb, suggesting 
that the syndrome was severe. At the cold Tamb of 12 °C, the Tcor response was virtually 
absent although the behavioral syndrom e was obvious (e.g., tremor, head shaking, 
forepaw treading, hindlimb abduction, etc) . The conclusion was confirmed by the 
significant effect of treatment (F 1, 7 = 16.1, p < 0.01), time (F 7, 49 = 4.6, p < 0.001) and 
treatment × time (F 7, 49 = 7.4,  p < 0.001). To further examine the time course of cold Tamb 
on Tcor, one-way ANOV A was run on each time point . These analyses indicated that cold 
Tamb blocked the Tcor from 2 to 6 hours after clorgyline and paroxetine injection. This is 
consistent with the hypothesi s that the syndrome could be  alleviated at cooling Tamb. The  97death of these animals was also recorded. Of th ese, 3 deaths occurred at standard but not 
cooling Tamb. Considering that the 5-HT 2A receptor antagonist ketanserin has the same 
blocking effect, my data clearly suppor t the hypothesis that the activity of 5-HT 2A 
receptor may be reduced at cooling temperature, which at least in part underlies the neural mechanism of clinical application.     983.4 Discussion  
 
The main finding of this study was that the activity of 5-HT 2A receptor might be 
enhanced and reduced, respectively, at warm and cold Tamb. Considering that cold Tamb 
could alleviate 5-HT toxicity while warm Tamb aggravated it (Malberg and Seiden, 1998; 
Miller and O'Callaghan, 2003; Bowyer et al., 1994), the presen t study suggests that 
changes in 5-HT 2A receptor activity may serve as the underlying neural mechanism of this 
Tamb effect. 
 In the study of Tamb effect, the syndrome was mode rate at a standard condition, 
showing normothermia. Paroxetine at 5 mg/kg was sufficient to cause a moderate 5-HT 
syndrome in combination of 2 mg/kg clorgylin e. Thus, this drug regimen was adopted to 
test a series of sy mptomatic responses at cold or warm Tamb. Under the standard Tamb, the 
moderate syndrome is associated with a 10-fo ld increase in 5-HT in the mPFC and POA. 
5-HT at this level can equal-potently activate 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A receptors for 
hypothermia and hyperthermia, respectively (Zha ng et al., 2008). Because of this, core 
body temperature was normothermia due to  a balanced activity between the 5-HT 1A and 
5-HT 2A receptors in thermoregulation. 
Our data indicated that warm Tamb potentiated the activity of 5-HT 2A receptor 
resulting in hyperthermia of the syndrome anim als. Consistent with  this hypothesis, the 
hyperthermia at warm Tamb was blocked by ketanserin treatm ent (Fig. 15). To further test 
this hypothesis, changes in extracellular 5-HT were also determined at different Tamb. 
5-HT was significantly increased at warm Tamb as compared to that at standard Tamb (Fig. 
17). Likewise, ketanserin pret reatment blocked the neuroche mical change at the warm  99Tamb, supporting the hypothesis.  
The enhanced activity of the 5-HT 2A receptor at the warm Tamb was also examined 
by DOI, a 5-HT 2A receptor agonist. In agreement with previous work (Mazzola-Pomietto 
et al., 1995; Wappler et al., 1997; Salmi P and Ahlenius, 1998), DOI at standard Tamb 
increased Tcor by stimulating 5-HT 2A receptors. One interesting finding in this study was 
that DOI-induced increases in Tcor were positively correlate d with the elevation of Tamb. 
Although neural mechanisms underlying the effect of Tamb on the 5-HT 2A receptor 
activity are far from clear, this can be partia lly explained that the affinity of the 5-HT 2A 
receptor to 5-HT is strengthened at higher experimental temperatures (Dalpiaz et al., 
1995).  
DOI was also used to test the head sh aking behavior to eliminate the possible 
interference of the muscular activity in the syndrome. However, DOI exhibits in both 
5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2C receptor activities (Halbersta dt et al., 2009). DOI-induced 
hyperthermia and head shaking behavior ma y be ascribed to the property of 5-HT 2A 
receptor activity since the effects were comple tely blocked by ketanserin (Fig. 16). Some 
studies suggested that MDMA has an affinity to 5-HT 2A receptors. My data are in line 
with the findings using MDMA at warm Tamb (Malberg and Seiden, 1998).  
A second finding of this study was that cold Tamb alleviated the syndrome by 
measuring changes in Tcor. It was hypothesized that cold Tamb desensitized the 5-HT 2A 
receptor. To test this hypothesis, animals habituated to cold Tamb. The Tcor was decreased 
in 5-HT syndrome animals, especially on the first hour. Hypothetically, this effect could 
be due to a decrease in 5-HT level and/or 5-HT 2A receptor activity. To test the 
involvement of 5-HT efflux at this event, changes in 5-HT in the mPFC and POA were  100measured. Interestingly, there was no difference in 5-HT between syndrome animals 
housed in cold and standard Tamb (Fig. 17), ruling out the possibility of involvement of 
5-HT changes at cold Tamb. Thus, it is likely that reduced activity of the 5-HT 2A receptor 
accounts for the hypothermia and mild syndrom e. This conclusion was supported by the 
results of DOI, the effect of which was also reduced at cold Tcor (Fig. 16f). It is 
well-known that cold Tamb is neuroprotective and alleviat ed its brain damages (Gunn and 
Thoresen, 2006). It is not very  surprising that cold measures  alleviates 5-HT syndrome in 
patients (Ener et al., 2003). My data s how that reduced activity of the 5-HT 2A receptor 
may be the mechanism underlying this effect. 
 Data revealed that changes in Tamb increased the basal Tcor to some extent (Fig. 
15a). Cold exposure may potentiate heat pr oduction and reduce the heat loss. On the 
other hand, the increase in basal Tcor at warm Tamb may result from the exceeding of 
thermoregulation (Ishiwata et al ., 2004). Interestingly, warm Tamb had no effect on basal 
Tcor of drug-naive animals (Fi g. 16). It suggests that chronic clorgyline treatment 
contributes to the effect, likely due  to enhanced activity of the 5-HT 2A receptor, which is 
worthwhile investigating.  
It was found in this study that ketanserin potentiated the hypothermia at cold Tamb 
(Fig. 15d) . This effect may be ascribed  to reduced activity of 5-HT 2A receptor and/or 
increased activity of 5-HT 1A receptor. This is consistent with a corollary of the 
observation that two recept ors have an opposite role in the regulation of body 
temperatures. 
 The effects of Tamb on head shakes and syndrome scores were determined in 
separate experiments. Although the 5-HT 2A receptor was considered to be enhanced at  101warm Tamb, intensity of the head shaking behavior was reduced (Fig. 18a). The reduction 
may be due to increased muscular clonus and rigidity (Ma et al., 2008). Indeed, the 
behavioral score was elevated. It suggests th at muscular activity of the syndrome animals 
is increased at the warm Tamb. Consistent with this thought, blocking 5-HT 2A receptor 
with ketanserin could significantly reduce the intensity of head shakes at warm Tamb (Fig. 
18).  
Interestingly, the behavioral score was also increased at cold Tamb. The effect can 
be ascribed to the increased activity of 5-HT 1A receptor. In support, cold exposure did not 
alter brain 5-HT and ketanserin had no eff ect on the behavioral score. Previous study 
suggested 5-HT 1A receptor was sensitized at cold Tamb, consistent with this hypothesis 
(Nicholas and Seiden, 2003). 
 Mortality is rare but may occur in pa tients with 5-HT syndrome. Much of 
evidence suggests that 5-HT 2A receptor mediates the mortality (Nisijima et al., 2001). As 
elucidated in Table 11, the mortality rate was increased at warm Tamb. The effect was 
blocked by ketanserin pretreatment. It  supports the hypothesis that the 5-HT 2A receptor 
also mediates warm Tamb-mediated death. In addition, the increased toxic responses at 
warm Tamb may also involve other 5-HT subtype receptors since there is an increased 
release in 5-HT (Malberg and Seiden, 1998; Miller and O'Callaghan, 2003; Marzuk et al., 
1998).  
Clinic reports have demonstrated that  cold exposure could alleviate 5-HT 
syndrome in patients (Ener et al., 2003) . My data demonstrated that cold Tamb blocked the 
hyperthermia and prevented the mortality at a paroxetine dose that normally causes a 
severe 5-HT syndrome (Fig. 19). As discusse d before, the effect of cold exposure may  102attribute to the desensitization of the 5-HT 2A receptor.   
 It is well known that Tamb influences biological func tions. For instance, cold Tamb 
is biologically protective and slows down  the progress of damages (Chou et al., 2003; 
Zalis et al., 1966). In contrast, warm Tamb aggravates diseases (Marzuk et al., 1998). By 
measuring changes in body temperature and mortality, my results indicated that warm and cold T
amb aggravated and alleviated the severity  of 5-HT syndrome, respectively. The 
affinity of the 5-HT 2A receptor to 5-HT at warm milieu was increased (Dalpiaz et al., 
1995). Together, it appears that the activity of 5-HT 2A receptor may be enhanced at warm 
Tamb, thus aggravating the syndrome. Clinically, the death relevant to 5-HT toxicity is 
more often at warm Tamb (Marzuk et al., 1998). Similarly, recreational drugs such as 
MDMA at raves are more toxic in ho t ballrooms. It was reported that Tamb altered activity 
of sympathetic nerve system (Leppaluoto et al., 1988), hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal 
(HPA) axis and hormones, e.g., thyroid hormone (Quintanar-Stephano et al., 1991). Some, 
if not all, of these changes might  relate to the activity of 5-HT 2A receptor (Kulikov and 
Zubkov, 2007). In future, mechanisms underlying the activity of 5-HT 2A receptors at 
different Tamb should be determined.  103

Animals had been pretreated with daily cl orgyline (CLG, 2 mg/kg, s.c.) for 3 days. On 
day 4, animals habituated to warm (32 °C) or cold (12 °C) Tamb for at least 2 hours before

(PRX, 5 mg/kg, i.p.) and clorgyline challeng e. Head shakes were expressed as the 
number of shakes counted on one hour imme diately after CLG and PRX administration. 
Behavioral score was the sum of six vari ables (tremor, forepaw treading, hindlimb

CHAPTER FOUR: BEHA VIORAL AND NEUROCHEMICAL 
CHARACTERIZATION OF THE MILD, MODERATE AND SEVERE 
SEROTONIN SYNDROMES EVOKED BY CHALLENGE INJECTION OF 
PAROXETINE COMBINED WITH CLORGYLINE 
 
4.1 Introduction  
 
Incidence of the 5-HT syndrome is ri sing in recent years with growing of 
antidepressant prescription (Isbi ster and Buckley, 2005; Isbi ster et al., 2007). Although 
most of cases are mild that can recover with  no needs of medical interference, patients 
with a severe syndrome are life-threatening. Thus, an understanding of syndrome severity 
is crucial to identify the severe cases that need immedi ate medical attention. Some 
criteria to measure the syndrome severity have been developed for human cases and 
animal studies. Isbister et al . (2007) suggested three levels of severity: mild, moderate 
and severe. The severity is usually estimat ed by changes in neuromuscular responses 
(Izumi et al., 2006; Speiser et al., 2008) and automatic functions, particularly body 
temperature (Nisijima et al ., 2004; Ma et al., 2008).  
In a previous study carried out in our la b, the syndrome severity was determined 
based on change in body temperature follo wing clorgyline and 5-HTP treatment in 
animals. It appears that 5-HTP comb ined with clorgyline causes hypothermia,  118normothermia and hyperthermia in the m ild, moderate and severe syndromes, 
respectively (Ma et al., 2008). Changes in body temperature and the syndrome severity 
were positively correlated with extr acellular 5-HT (Zhang et al., 2009).  
In this study a new animal model of the 5-HT syndrome was developed, but not 
systematically characterized such as body temp erature, behaviors and brain 5-HT level, 
which impedes understanding of the 5-HT syndrom e. Therefore, the ai m of this section 
was to characterize mild, moderate a nd severe syndromes evoked by paroxetine 
combined with clorgyline at the paroxetine doses of 1, 5 and 15 mg/kg, respectively. To 
characterize this new model, changes in anti depressant dose were correlated to behavior 
and mortality. Our data indicated that pa roxetine combined with clorgyline at the 
paroxetine doses of 1, 5 and 15 mg/kg evoked mild, moderate and severe syndromes on 
day 4 in rats receiving clorgy line pretreatment for 3 days.  
     1194.2 Materials and methods 
Animal preparation, chemicals and sche dule for drug injectio n, induction of the 
5-HT syndrome animals, measurement of core body temperature, head shake and 
behavioral score recording, surgery, microdial ysis procedures and histology were similar 
to those in chapter two and three.    
 
Data analysis 
Changes in body temperature are expressed as mean ± SEM. Microdialysis results 
of 5-HT are expressed as fold increases above the baseline (mean ± SEM). Two-way 
repeated measures ANOV A was used to eval uate overall response among the control and 
experimental groups. If significant effects were found,  post hoc  Scheffe’s test was used to 
compare effects of different treatment groups . One-way ANOV A was also used to assess 
the statistical differences among groups. Th e Fisher’s exact test was employed to 
substitute the Chi Square test to analyze the mortality rate if the sample size was five or 
less. Simple linear regression analysis was us ed to evaluate the dose-dependent response 
to paroxetine. The significant level was set at p < 0.05. 
  1204.3 Results 
 Changes in T
cor in rats induced by paroxeti ne combined with clorgyline 
Data in the chapter two indicated that the activity of 5-HT 2A receptor might be 
enhanced for inducing the severe 5-HT syndrom e in rats receiving clorgyline for 3 days.  
Therefore, this clorgyline paradigm was also used in this chapter. Animals had received 
once daily clorgyline (2 mg/kg, s.c.) for 3 days . On day 4, animals were challenged with 
paroxetine and clorgyline with the paroxeti ne doses at 0, 1, 5 or 15 mg/kg. The basal 
(prior challenge) Tcor was 37.89 ± 0.08 °C ( n = 54). As shown in Figure 20, there were 
paroxetine dose-dependently increases in Tcor. Two-way repeated ANOV A showed that 
paroxetine had significant effect on the change of Tcor as demonstrated by the significant 
effect of treatment (F 3, 27 = 28.3, p < 0.001), time (F 7, 189 = 2.7, p < 0.05) and treatment × 
time (F 21, 189  = 10.9, p < 0.001). Post hoc  analyses showed, compar ed with vehicle group, 
15 mg/kg paroxetine significantly increased the T cor (p < 0.001, Scheffe’s test). There 
were no differences of 1mg/kg paroxetine group ( p > 0.05, Scheffe’s test) and 5 mg/kg 
paroxetine group ( p > 0.05, Scheffe’s test) to vehicle group. To further examine the time 
course of paroxetine doses on Tcor, one-way ANOV A was run on each time point. These 
analyses indicated th at paroxetine doses  altered the Tcor after drug challenge ( p < 0.001). 
Post hoc  comparisons indicated that 1 mg/kg paroxetine decreased Tcor on the first hour 
after paroxetine injection and 15 mg/kg paroxetine increased Tcor on the 2 to 6 hours after 
paroxetine challenge ( p < 0.001, Scheffe’s test). Specifical ly, 1 and 15 mg/kg paroxetine 
decreased and increased the Tcor, respectively ( p < 0.01, Scheffe’s test), while 5 mg/kg 
had no significant effect ( p > 0.05, Scheffe’s test). It appears that 1, 5 and 15 mg/kg  121paroxetine in combination with clorgyline on day 4 induces mild, moderate and severe 
5-HT syndromes, respectively, in animals r eceiving clorgyline pretreatment for 3 days.  
 
Changes in brain 5-HT in the syndrome induced by paroxetine combined with 
clorgyline in the chronic clorgyline-pretreated animals 
Here changes in brain 5-HT in the mil d, moderate and severe syndromes were 
explored. After 3-day clorgyline pretreatme nt, basal 5-HT (pg/sample) was 2.40 ± 0.35 ( n 
= 10) in the mPFC and 3.36 ± 0.37 ( n = 15) in the POA. As shown in Figure 21, 
paroxetine challenge injection caused a dose-de pendently increase in 5-HT in the mPFC.  
Two-way repeated ANOV A showed that paroxeti ne had significant effects on 5-HT efflux 
in the mPFC as demonstrated by th e significant effect of treatment (F 3, 20 = 75.3, p < 
0.001), time (F 7, 140 = 2.7, p < 0.05) and treatment × time (F 21, 140  = 28.4, p < 0.001). Post 
hoc analyses showed 5 and 15 mg/kg paroxeti ne significantly increased the mPFC 5-HT 
efflux  to the vehicle ( p < 0.01, Scheffe’s test). To further examine the time course of 
paroxetine doses on 5-HT level in the mPFC, one-way ANOV A was run on each time 
point. These analyses indicated that paroxetine altered 5-HT  level after drug challenge ( p 
< 0.001). Post hoc  comparisons indicated that 1 mg/ kg paroxetine increased 5-HT on the 
second hour after paroxetine injection, 5 mg /kg PRX increased 5-HT on the 1, 2, 3 and 6 
hours after paroxetine challenge.  15 mg/kg paroxetine increased Tcor on the 6 hours after 
paroxetine challenge ( p < 0.05, Scheffe’s test). 
Similarly, 5-HT level in POA was increas ed after paroxetine injection. Two-way 
repeated ANOVA showed that paroxetine had si gnificant effect on 5-HT efflux in POA 
as demonstrated by the signifi cant effect of treatment (F 3, 16 = 57.1, p < 0.001), time (F 7,  122112 = 2.7, p < 0.001) and treatment × time (F 21, 112  = 28.4, p < 0.001). To further examine 
the time course of paroxetine on 5-HT le vel in mPFC, one-way ANOVA was run on each 
time point. These analyses indicated that paroxetine doses  altered 5-HT le vel after drug 
challenge ( p < 0.001). Post hoc  comparisons indicated that 5 and 15 mg/kg PRX 
enhanced 5-HT releas e after it injection ( p < 0.05, Scheffe’s test). 
In the mPFC, the maximal increase was ~ 5- fold (4.9 ± 0.6) in response to 1 mg/kg 
paroxetine, 10-fold (10.7 ± 1.2) to 5 mg/ kg paroxetine and 30-fold (33.9 ± 3.6) to 15 
mg/kg paroxetine. Increased efflux in the POA was similar to those in the mPFC, 
showing 3.8 ± 0.8, 12.7 ± 2.8 and 24.9 ± 1.5 fold-i ncrease corresponding to 1, 5 and 15 
mg/kg paroxetine, respectively (Fig. 20).  
 
Changes in head shakes and behavioral score in the 5-HT syndrome animals  
Head shake and behavioral score were meas ured in the mild, moderate and severe 
5-HT syndrome animals. The number of head shakes on one hour was counted 
immediately after challenge in jection of paroxetine combin ed with clorgyline. In a 
control study, clorgyline co mbined with vehicle (0.9% NaCl) had no effect on head 
shaking behavior. For the sake of clarity, ve hicle group was not pres ented in the graph. 
Interestingly, paroxetine at three doses evoked the same effect. One-way ANOV A 
demonstrated that there was no significant di fferences in head shakes between doses (F 2, 
18 = 1.8, p > 0.05).  
Behavioral score is the su m of six variables including tremor, forepaw treading, 
hindlimb abduction, Straub tail and immobility. E ach variable was measured with a scale 
of 1 (mild), 2 (moderate) or 3 (severe) as de fined in Table 10. Clorgyline combined with  123vehicle had no effect on behavioral score and thus data were not presented in the graph 
for the sake of clarity. Unlike the head sh aking behavior, the behavioral scores were 
paroxetine dose-dependent (F 2, 22 = 41.1, p < 0.001). 
 
Regression analysis of tremor, forepa w treading, hindlimb abduction, Straub 
tail and immobility in the 5-HT syndrome 
Bivariate and regression anal ysis was used to evaluate  the relationship between 
paroxetine doses and behavi oral scores. Each behavior al score was based on the 
definition as described in Table 10. As a re sult, paroxetine doses  produced a positive 
correlation with each of behavioral signs. These included tremor (Pearson r = 0.81, F 1, 31 
= 57.834, p < 0.001), forepaw treading (Pearson r = 0.78, F 1, 31 = 48.648, p < 0.001), 
hindlimb abduction (Pearson r = 0.81, F 1, 31 = 57.457, p < 0.001), Straub tail (Pearson r = 
0.87, F 1, 31 = 91.8,  p < 0.001), immobility (Pearson r = 0.86, F 1, 31 = 91.289 ,  p < 0.001) 
and total behavioral scores (Pearson r = 0.83, F 1, 30 = 67.959 ,  p < 0.001).   
 
Change in fatality of the 5-HT syndrome animals 
Finally, fatality for each group in the s yndrome was analyzed. Table 13 showed the 
number of death in 24 hours after the animals underwent th rough the mild, moderate or 
severe syndrome. Some of those injected with a high dose of pa roxetine at 15 mg/kg 
combined with clorgyline resulted in d eath in the syndrome (Fisher’s exact test, p < 0.05).  1244.4 Discussion 
 
The present results indicated that the 5-HT  syndrome severity could be different. 
After 3-day chronic clorgyline pretreatment, paroxetine combined with clorgyline at the 
paroxetine doses of 1, 5 and 15 mg/kg evoke d mild, moderate and severe syndromes, 
respectively.  
 The relationship between changes in Tcor and syndrome severity has been 
investigated in substantial details in both animal studies and huma n case reports (Izumi et 
al., 2006; Speiser et al., 2008). Tcor measurement has a great value in terms of 
understanding of the severity of the syndrom e (Isbister et al., 2007; Ma et al., 2008). 
Hypothermia, normothermia and hyperthermia are indicative of a mild, moderate and 
severe 5-HT syndrome, respectively, in the animal study (Ma et al ., 2008). In agreement 
with previous studies (Abdel-Fattah et al., 1997; Ma et al., 2008), paroxetine combined 
with clorgyline also pr oduced three types of Tcor response in this new animal model of 
5-HT syndrome (Fig. 20). It was paroxeti ne dose-dependent. Specifically, challenge 
injection of 1, 5 and 15 mg/kg paroxetine with clorgyline was associated with 
hypothermia, normothermia and hyperthermia, re spectively. It suggests that the animal 
model developed in this study can  be used to reveal the s yndrome at different severity 
levels. Note that neural mechanisms behind Tcor in the syndrome have been well 
established. For instan ce, post-synaptic 5-HT 1A receptor is responsible for the 
hypothermia (Darmani and Zhao, 1998). In contrast, 5-HT 2A receptor mediates the 
hyperthermia (Nisijima et al ., 2001; Abdel-Fattah et al., 1997; Lin et al., 1998). Given 
that the affinity of the 5-HT 2A receptor to 5-HT is 400 – 1000 times lower than that of  1255-HT 1A receptor (Dalpiaz et al ., 1995; Peroutka et al., 1981 ), it appears that a small 
increase in extracellular 5-HT w ould prefer strongly activating 5-HT 1A receptors although 
there might be weakly at 5-HT 2A receptors. When extracellular 5-HT reaches a 
remarkable level, it will activate 5-HT 2A receptors and induce hyperthermia. The 
normothermia may be a functional balance between 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A receptors. The 
hypothesis was thoroughly tested in this st udy by measuring extracellular 5-HT at 
different Tcor states.   
Figure 21 showed that the leve ls of extracellular 5-HT in the POA and mPFC had a 
similar pattern as changes in the core body temperature and severity of the syndrome. 
POA, especially medial POA is a key regi on for thermoregulation by sending excitatory 
signals to control h eat loss or gain (Nagashima, 2006) . Meanwhile, POA neurons receive 
the number of serotonergic projection and contain 5-HT 2A receptors to regulate the Tcor 
(Pompeiano et al., 1992; Chai and Lin, 1977; Boulant, 1981, 2000, 2006; Lin, 1979). For 
the aforementioned reason, 5-HT level in the POA was measured. A second brain area 
investigated in this study was the mPFC, a brain region for consciousness (Miller and 
Cohen, 2001; Fuster, 2006) and behavioral  integration and execution (Duncan, 2001; 
Frith and Frith, 1999; Miller and Cohen, 2001). Since there was mental abnormality in 
the syndrome, changes in 5-HT was therefor e determined in this cortical region.  
It was found that 5-HT efflux in the m PFC was 5-fold, 11-fold and 34-fold in 
response to paroxetine combin ed with clorgyline at the pa roxetine doses of 1, 5 and 15 
mg/kg, respectively. Similarly, 5-HT efflux in  the POA was 4-fold, 13-fold and 25-fold, 
respectively. Considering that the 5-HT 1A receptor is responsible for mediating the 
hypothermia (Darmani and Zhao, 1998) and the 5-HT 2A receptor for the hyperthermia  126(Nisijima et al., 2001; Abdel-Fattah et al., 1997 ; Lin et al., 1998; Ya mawaki et al., 1986; 
Goodwin et al., 1987; Gudelsky et al., 1986; O'Connell et al., 1992), it can be 
extrapolated that the 5-HT 1A receptor is predominately active for hypothermia when 
extracellular 5-HT was less than 5-fold. When 5-HT increases up to 10-fold, the activities 
of 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A receptors may be equally balanced. This may explain the 
normothermic response to 5 mg/kg paroxeti ne combined with cl orgyline through which 
animals have a moderate syndrome. However, when 5-HT exceeds 10-fold, the 5-HT 2A 
receptor may be predominately active, eliciting the hyperthermia. The relationship 
between extracellular 5-HT and changes in Tcor has been reported in the other studies 
(Ishigooka et al., 1993; Zhang et al., 2009). It suggests that th e similar relationship must 
exist in human patients although 5-HT le vels in patients are not available. 
The syndrome was associated with a 1100-fo ld increase in 5-HT in the other study 
(Nisijima et al., 2004). However, my data revealed only a 35-fold increase. The 
discrepancy can be ascribed to the differ ence in agents used. Theoretically, 5-HTP 
increases extracellular 5-HT in the serotone rgic neurons and other cells that contain 
decarboxylases. In this new animal model of 5-HT syndrome, however, increase in 5-HT 
mainly takes place in serotonergic neurons. Thus, 5-HT measured in this model more 
resembles that in the human case. 
 In this study, it was found that the numb er of head shakes increased in the 
syndrome (Fig. 22a). However, it was not correl ated with the severity of the syndrome. 
Head shake is an important in dictor for the activity of 5-HT 2A receptors (Peroutka et al., 
1981; Ma et al., 2008; Goodwin et al., 1987; Van Oekelen et al., 2003). The discrepancy 
between the severity and the number of head shakes may attribute to the muscle activity.  127It has been observed that the head shakes we re disrupted by the muscle  rigidity (Ma et al., 
2008). Indeed, our data showed that the beha vioral score increased (Fig. 22b), supporting 
that the muscle intensity may be the factor  that restraints h ead shaking behavior. 
Consistently, there was no correlation between  the number of head shakes with 5-HT 
level or mortality.     
Except for head shakes, othe r syndrome behaviors, if  not all, are probably 
mediated by postsynaptic 5-HT 1A receptor (Yamada et al., 1988). 8-OH-DPAT at high 
doses induced tremor, forepaw treading, hind limb abduction and flat body (Darmani and 
Zhao, 1998; Goodwin et al., 1986, 1987; Darm ani and Ahmad, 1999). In this study, we 
found that paroxetine and clorgyline chal lenge provoked a paroxetine dose-dependent 
increase in tremor, forepaw treading, hind limb abduction, Straub tail and flat body 
posture (Table 12). For comparison, a high dos e of 8-OH-DPAT (0.5 mg/kg) was used to 
elicit the syndrome symptoms (data not show n). It was observed th at those behavioral 
response was alike each other, if not identical. Thus, the 5-HT 1A receptor may be one of 
the mediators of those symptoms of the syndrome.  
Several clinical reports s uggest that mortality results  from the increase in Tcor 
(hyperthermia) in the 5-HT syndrome anim als. As body temperature exceeded 41.5 °C, 
about two-thirds of cases ended in deat h (Gowing et al., 2002; Nisijima et al., 2001). 
Similarly, the death in these animals with the syndrome was always preceded 
hyperthermia.  
 Immobility and ataxia [due to akathisia and dyskinesia of extrapyramidal disorder 
(Lane, 1998)] were observed in the syndrome animals. The primary cause for these signs 
may lie in that the 5-HT neurons directly innervate the basal ganglia, the primary motor  128areas that control the axial skeletal muscles. Excessive 5-HT released in the basal ganglia 
may induce these behaviors (Steinbusch, 1981). Based on the facts that excessive 5-HT 
increased in the mPFC was similar to that in the POA, it could be assumed that 5-HT 
level was globally elevated in the syndrome, likely at the same level in other regions 
including basal ganglia for inducing the im mobility and ataxia. Changes in dopamine 
efflux are associated locomotion disorders (L ambert et al., 1998). Alternative hypothesis 
is that increased dopaminergic transmissi on in nigrostriatal pathway involves the 
muscular hyperactivity in the syndrome, as  suggested in the l iterature (Jacobs and 
Azmitia, 1992). 
In this study, we noticed that diarrhea  appeared in the syndrome animals. The 
receptor mechanism behind this phenomenon may arise from the fact that 5-HT 
stimulates gastric pepsin secr etion, intestinal motility, and co nversion of small intestinal 
mucosa from absorption to secretion of water and electrolytes through 5-HT 3 receptor 
stimulation (Jaffe, 1979). 
In summary, the behavioral results of the present study indica te that challenge 
injection of paroxetine combin ed with clorgyline on day 4 with the paroxetine doses at 1, 
5 and 15 mg/kg can induce the mild, moderate and severe 5-HT syndrome, respectively, 
in animals receiving daily clorgyline for 3 days. Microdialysis studies reveal that 5-HT 1A 
receptor may be predominately active in the mild syndrome when extracellular 5-HT is 
less than 5-fold of basal rele ase for inducing hypothermia. As  extracellular 5-HT exceeds 
30-fold, the syndrome become severe while 5-HT 2A receptor is predominately active for 
inducing hyperthermia. The syndrome is modera te at a 20-fold (±5 fold) increase in 
5-HT.  129

CHAPTER FIVE: INVOLVEMENT OF TH E MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX 
AND POSITIVE-FEEDBACK CIRCUIT IN THE PROGRESSION OF A BENIGN 
SYNDROME TOWARD MALIGNANT SYNDROME 
 
5.1 Introduction 
 
Excessive 5-HT in the brain is the initia l cause of the 5-HT syndrome. The higher 
5-HT level, the more serious the syndrome becomes (Ishigooka et al., 1993; Zhang et al., 
2009). Decrease in 5-HT efflux could alleviat e the syndrome and pr event the fatality 
(Zhang et al., 2009). In the brain, 5-HT is de rived exclusively from raphe serotonergic 
neurons, participating in regul ating physiological activities as well as involving mental 
disorders (Jacobs and Azmitia, 1992; Meltzer, 1999). The DRN and MRN are two major resources in the brain for serotonergic proj ections. They also receive afferents from 
various brain areas, including hypothalamus, basa l ganglia and especial ly mPFC (Sakai et 
al., 1977; Hoover and Vertes , 2007; Hajos et al., 1998). 
Anatomical and electrophysiological studies  have revealed a r eciprocal connection 
between the mPFC and raphe nuclei. Layer V pyramidal neurons in the mPFC receives 
monoaminergic afferents from DRN and MRN (Azmitia and Segal, 1978) and send glutamatergic efferents back to raphe (Mar tin-Ruiz et al., 2001; Aghajanian and Wang, 
1977; Hajos et al., 1998). The mPFC neurons co ntain a large density of 5-HT receptors,  138especially 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 1A receptors (Aghajanian and Marek, 1997, 1999). An 
approximate 60% of postsynaptic neurons in the mPFC that have raphe serotonergic 
innervations express 5-HT 2A receptor (Vazquez-Borsetti et al., 2009). On the other hand, 
serotonergic neurons in the raphe are regul ated by glutamatergic afferents via NMDA 
receptors (Tao et al., 2007; Tao and Auerb ach, 1996). Several studies indicated that 
5-HT 2A receptor agonists enhanced the EPSC ac tivity of glutamatergic pyramidal neurons 
in the mPFC (Aghajanian and Marek, 1997, 1999)  and cell firing of 5-HT neurons in the 
DRN (Martin-Ruiz R et al., 2001) and 5-HT re lease in the mPFC (Amargos-Bosch et al., 
2004). Moreover, NMDA increased the 5-HT neuron firing (Gartside et al., 2007) and 
5-HT release in the DRN and MRN (Tao and Au erbach, 1996). Thus, it appears that there 
is a reciprocal connection be tween glutamatergic pyramidal  neurons in the mPFC and 
serotonergic neurons in the raphe (Arango et  al., 2002; Azmitia and Segal, 1978; Conrad 
et al., 1974). This is a positive-feedback ci rcuit that is of particular importance in 
psychiatric diseases, e.g., major depression. Pa rt of my study in this  section was based on 
aforementioned circuit and explored its role in the 5-HT syndrome. 
It was proposed that exce ssive 5-HT activated 5-HT 2A receptors located on 
glutamatergic neurons in the mPFC for i nducing the syndrome by the circuit between 
mPFC and raphe. Moreover, 5-HT efflux mi ght consist of primary and secondary 
components that were responsible for beni gn and malignant syndromes, respectively. 
This was because that glutamate was also elic ited in the syndrome, causing an additional 
release of 5-HT associated w ith this circuit. It  was a cycle that would boost 5-HT to 
exceeding level for inducing more serious syndrome.  1395.2 Materials and Methods 
Animal preparation, core body temperature and behavioral measurement, histology 
and data analysis were identical to those described in chapter two. 
  
Chemicals and schedule for injection  
Clorgyline, (±) DOI-hydrochloride, O-pht haldialdehyde, mercaptoethanol were 
purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) . Ketanserin and (+)-MK801 were obtained 
from Tocris (Ellisville MO, USA). U73122 was from Santa Cruz  Biotech (Santa Cruz CA, 
USA). Solvents and routes for drug administ ration were elucidated in Table 14. Except 
for paroxetine, drugs were injected at a constant volume of 1 ml/kg of body weight. 
Paroxetine was dissolved in the water a nd administered at a volume of 3 ml/kg body 
weight. 
 
Animal preparation for the syndrome 
Clorgyline (2 mg/kg) was injected subc utaneously once daily at 12:00 noon for 
consecutive 3 days. On day 4, animals were challenged with clorgyline combined with 
paroxetine for evoking a 5-HT syndrome. An tagonists were admini stered 30 (systemic 
injection) or 60 min (local pe rfusion) before clorgyline and paroxetine challenge. In the 
control group, vehicle was used to substitute respective agents. 
 
Surgery and microdialysis procedures 
Rats were anesthetized by a combination of ketamine (80 mg/ kg, i.p.) and xylazine 
(6 mg/kg, i.p.), and mounted in a Kopf stereotaxic frame in a flat skull position. Guide  140cannulae (10 or11 mm in length;  22 gauge stainless steel tube ) were in implanted aiming 
to mPFC, POA, DRN and MRN. The coordina tion is according to the rat brain atlas 
(Paxinos and Watson, 1998) and elucidated in Table 15. After surgery, rats were allowed 
to recover for one week before experiments.  
One night before microdialysis, rats were br iefly made to inhale with isoflurane for 
anesthesia. I-shaped microdialysis probes (cut -off 18 kD) were inserted through the guide 
cannula targeting at the mPFC, POA, DRN or  MRN and secured in place with dental 
cement. The probe inlet was attached to a perfusion line from Raturn ™ system 
(Bioanalytical System Inc., W. Lafayette, IN), and infused with the artificial 
cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; containing  140 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.5 mM CaCl 2, 1 mM 
MgCl 2, 0.25 mM NaH 2PO 4, and 1.0 mM Na 2HPO 4; pH: 7.4) at a flow rate of 1 µl/min. 
Next day, two dialysate samples were colle cted to determine the basal value before 
administration of drugs. Samples were collec ted at one-hour interval starting at 10:00 
a.m. 
 
5-HT and glutamate analysis 
A reverse-phase column (4.6 ×30 mm, packed with PP-ODS) was used for 5-HT 
separation. The composition of mobile phase was 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) 
containing 1% methanol, 500 mg/L sodium-1 -octanesulfonate, and 50 mg/L EDTA. The 
flow rate was 350 μl/min. HPLC-electrochemical dete ction (HTEC-500; EICOM, Japan) 
with a CMA/200 refrigerator microsampler (CMA/Microdialysis, Stockholm, Sweden) 
was used to determine 5-HT level in the sa mple. The potential setting on the graphite 
electrode was + 350 mV (relative to Ag /AgCl reference el ectrode) (Fig. 8).  141Separate settings of HPLC-electrochemi cal detection systems were used to 
determine glutamate concentration in dialys ate sample. Samples were first added with 
derivation reagent (O-phthaldia ldehyde/mercaptoethanol). The reagent consisted of 10 μL 
of 2-mercaptoethanol in 1 ml O-phthaldia ldehyde solution (12 mg dissolved in 600 μl of 
methanol and diluted in 5.4 ml of 0.1 M bor ate buffer, pH 9.5). Derivation was performed 
by mixing 10 μl of the sample or standard with 10 μl of the reagent solution. 10 μl 
derivate solution was injected automatically by  a refrigerated autoinjector (SIL 10 AXL; 
Shimadzu) or manually into a reverse-phase  microsphere column (2 × 100 mm, packed 
with a C18, 3 μm particle size). A working electr ode (MF-1000, BAS) was set at + 700 
mV (LC-4C) vs an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The mobile phase was 0.1 M phosphate 
buffer (pH 6.0), containing 5% methanol and 40 mg/L EDTA (Fig. 24). The flow rate was 
400 μl /min delivered by a LC -10AT Shimadzu pump. Glutamate was estimated by 
comparing peak areas between microdialys is samples and known standard using 
Powerchrom V2.2 software.     
  1425.3 Results 
 
Re-evaluate the circuit between mPFC and raphe using drug-naïve animals 
Neurochemical evidence of the circuit be tween raphe and mPFC was very merger  
despite a series of electrophysiological i nvestigation (Aghajani an and Marek, 1997, 1999). 
Therefore, the circuit was re-evaluated by locally activating mPFC  or raphe (DRN and 
MRN) neurons. Local perfusion of 300 µM NM DA (a glutamate NMDA receptor agonist) 
into the DRN significantly increased 5-HT efflux in the mPFC (Fig. 25a). It was 
confirmed by two-way repeated ANOV A show ed that NMDA enhanced 5-HT efflux in 
the mPFC as demonstrated by the si gnificant effect of treatment (F 1, 12 = 7.6, p < 0.05), 
time (F 6, 72 = 2.3, p < 0.05) and treatment × time (F 6, 72 = 2.5, p < 0.05). To further 
examine the time course of NMDA in DRN on 5-HT level in mPFC, T-test was run on 
each time point. There was a significant di fferent on the 40 min after NMDA perfusion.  
Likewise, NMDA in the MRN also signi ficantly enhanced 5-HT output in the 
mPFC (Fig. 15b). Two-way repeated ANOV A s howed that NMDA enhanced 5-HT efflux 
in the mPFC as demonstrated by th e significant effect of treatment (F 1, 11 = 6.8, p < 0.05), 
but not time (F 6, 66 = 1.1, p > 0.05) and treatment × time (F 6, 66 = 2.1, p > 0.05). To further 
examine the time course of NMDA in the MR N on 5-HT level in the mPFC, independent 
sample T-test was run on each time point. There was a significant difference on the 40 min after NMDA perfusion.  
On the other hand, infusion of 300 µM DOI in the mPFC signif icantly increased 
glutamate level in the DRN (Fig. 25c). Two- way repeated ANOV A showed that DOI in 
the mPFC enhanced glutamate efflux in the DRN as demonstrated by the significant  143effect of treatment (F 1, 10 = 14.9, p < 0.01), time (F 6, 60 = 3.0, p < 0.05) and treatment × 
time (F 6, 60 = 4.3, p < 0.05). To further examine the time course of NMDA in the MRN on 
5-HT level in mPFC, independent sample T- test was run on each time point. There were 
significant differences on the 20 an d 60 min after NMDA perfusion. 
Similarly, infusion of 300 µM DOI in th e mPFC significantly increased glutamate 
level in the DRN (Fig. 25d). Two-way repeat ed ANOV A showed that DOI in the mPFC 
enhanced glutamate efflux in DRN as demonstr ated by the significant effect of treatment 
(F1, 10 = 6.8, p < 0.05), time (F 6, 60 = 3.3, p < 0.01) and treatment × time (F 6, 60 = 3.2, p < 
0.01). To further examine the time course of NMDA in MRN on 5-HT level in mPFC, independent sample T-test was run on each ti me point. There was significant difference 
on the 20 min after NMDA perfusion. 
 
Effects of ketanserin and MK801 on the antidepressant-evoked hyperthermia 
in the severe syndrome 
 
To evaluate the role of 5-HT 2A receptor-mediated circuit between mPFC and raphe 
nuclei (DRN and MRN) on the malignant 5- HT syndrome, receptor antagonists were 
used systemically to disrupt the circuit. My  hypothesis predicted that hyperthermia would 
be blocked in the syndrome. The basal Tcor was 37.77 ± 0.08 °C ( n = 55). As shown in 
Figure 26a, ketanserin, a 5-HT 2A receptor antagonist, bloc ked the hyperthermia of the 
severe syndrome (F 2, 17 = 37.1, p < 0.001) (Fig. 26a).  This conclusion was confirmed by 
two-way repeated measures ANOV A, which reve aled the significant effect of treatment 
(F2, 17 = 37.1, p < 0.001), time (F 8, 136 = 8.2, p < 0.001) and treatment × time (F 16, 136  = 
22.4, p < 0.001). Post hoc  analyses showed ketanserin pretreatment blocked the  144hyperthermia of the 5-HT syndrome animals ( p < 0.001, Scheffe’s test). To further 
investigate the time course of ketanserin treatment on Tcor, one-way ANOV A was run on 
each time point. These analyses indi cated that ketans erin altered the Tcor on the 6 hours 
after clorgyline and paroxetine injection. Post hoc  comparisons indicated that ketanserin 
decreased the Tcor for 7 hours after its administration. 
Similarly, systemic administration of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 also 
blocked the hyperthermia (Fig. 26b).  Two-way repeated ANOV A showed that MK-801 
had a significant effect on the Tcor induced by CLG and PRX as demonstrated by the 
significant effect of treatment (F 2, 16 = 7.5, p < 0.01), time (F 8, 128 = 3.0, p < 0.001) and 
treatment × time (F 16, 128 = 9.1, p < 0.001). Post hoc  analyses showed ketanserin 
pretreatment blocked the hyperthermia  of the 5-HT syndrome animals ( p < 0.001, 
Scheffe’s test). To further investigate the time course of MK801 treatment on Tcor, 
one-way ANOV A was run on each time point. These analyses indicated that MK801 
altered the Tcor 5 hours after clorgyline a nd paroxetine injection. Post hoc  comparisons 
indicated that MK801 decreased the Tcor from 1 to 5 hours after clorgyline and paroxetine 
administration. 
 
Effects of ketanserin and MK801 on 5-HT efflux in the mPFC and POA of the 
severe syndrome  
It was found in the previous study that both 5-HT 2A and NMDA receptor 
antagonists blocked the hyperthermia  of the animals with the severe syndrome (Ma, et al. 
2008). In this study, effect of the antagonist s on 5-HT efflux was examined on the severe 
5-HT syndrome animals. As shown in Figure 27a, systemic administration of ketanserin  145significantly attenuated the increase in 5-HT of the mPFC in response to the 
antidepressant challenge for inducing the severe syndrome. Two-way repeated ANOV A 
showed that ketanserin had significant eff ect on the change of 5-HT level induced by 
CLG and PRX as demonstrated by the significant effect of treatment (F 2, 12 = 15.3, p < 
0.01), time (F 8, 96 = 23.8, p < 0.001) and treatment × time (F 16, 96 = 8.8, p < 0.001).  Post 
hoc comparisons showed ketanserin could signifi cant inhibit the increase of 5-HT efflux 
(p < 0.05, Scheffe’s test). To further investigat e the time course of ketanserin treatment on 
mPFC 5-HT, one-way ANOV A was run on each ti me point. These analyses indicated that 
ketanserin altered 5-HT level 1 to 6 hours after clorgyline and paroxetine injection ( p < 
0.01). Post hoc  comparisons indicated that  ketanserin decreased 5-HT  3 to 6 hours after 
clorgyline and paroxetine administration ( p < 0.05, Scheffe’s test). 
Likewise, MK801 at the dose of 0.25 mg/kg al so reduced the increase in 5-HT in 
the mPFC (Fig. 27b). It was confirmed by two-way repeated ANOV A showing that 
MK-801 had significant effect on the change of 5-HT level induced by CLG and PRX as 
demonstrated by the significant effect of treatment (F 2, 14 = 16.2, p < 0.001), time (F 8, 112 
= 22.6, p < 0.001) and treatment × time (F 16, 112  = 8.9, p < 0.001). Post hoc comparisons 
showed ketanserin could significant i nhibit the increase of 5-HT efflux ( p < 0.01, 
Scheffe’s test). To further investigate the time course of MK801 treatment on mPFC 5-HT, 
one-way ANOV A was run on each time point. These analyses indicated that MK801 
altered 5-HT level on the 1 to 6 hours afte r clorgyline and paroxetine injection ( p < 0.05). 
Post hoc  comparisons indicated that  ketanserin decreased 5-HT  1 to 6 hours after 
clorgyline and paroxetine administration ( p < 0.05, Scheffe’s test). 
In the POA, both ketanserin and MK801 si gnificantly attenuated the increased  1465-HT efflux (Fig. 27c). Two-way repeated ANOV A showed that ketanserin and MK-801 
had significant effect on 5-HT level indu ced by CLG and PRX as demonstrated by the 
significant effect of treatment (F 2, 12 = 16.0, p < 0.001), time (F 8, 96 = 80.6, p < 0.001) and 
treatment × time (F 16, 96 = 12.2, p < 0.001). Post hoc comparisons showed both ketanserin 
and MK801 significantly reduced th e increase in 5-HT efflux ( p < 0.01, Scheffe’s test). 
To further investigate the tim e course of ketanserin a nd MK801 treatment on POA 5-HT, 
one-way ANOV A was run on each time point. Thes e analyses indicated that ketanserin 
and MK801 altered 5-HT level 2 to 6 hours af ter clorgyline and paroxetine injection ( p < 
0.01). Post hoc  comparisons indicated that ke tanserin or MK801 decreased 5-HT  2 to 6 
hours after clorgyline and pa roxetine administration ( p < 0.05, Scheffe’s test). 
 To further analyze the data, the maxima l effect was re-expressed in Figure 27e 
and 27d. The maximal 5-HT increase was 35-fold in the mPFC. Ketanserin and MK801 reduced it to 15- and 12-fold, respectively ( p < 0.01, Scheffe’s test; Fig. 27d). Likewise, 
the maximal increase in POA was 28-fold in  the vehicle control,  ketanserin and MK801 
reduced it to 16- and 10-fold, respectively ( p < 0.05, Scheffe’s test) (Fig. 27e).     
 
Effects of ketanserin and MK801 on glut amate efflux in the DRN and MRN of 
the severe syndrome animals 
To test the circuit hypothesis, glut amate efflux in the DRN and MRN was 
determined for its role in inducing th e syndrome. Baseline glutamate was 0.55 ± 0.09 μM 
(n = 30) in the DRN and 0.47 ± 0.07 μM (n = 27) in the MRN. As shown in Figure 28, 
challenge injection of paroxetine combined  with clorgyline for inducing the severe 
syndrome caused an increase in glutamate in  these two raphe nuclei. The increase was  147significant. Ketanserin pretreated 30 min be fore the challenge injection attenuated the 
Glu increase in the DRN (Fig. 28). Two-wa y repeated ANOV A showed that ketanserin 
had a significant effect on the change of Glu level induced by CLG and PRX as 
demonstrated by the significant effect of treatment (F 2, 17 = 6.3, p < 0.01), time (F 8, 136 = 
4.6, p < 0.001) and treatment × time (F 16, 136  = 3.5, p < 0.001). Post hoc comparisons 
showed ketanserin did not significantly re duced the increase in glutamate efflux ( p > 0.05, 
Scheffe’s test). To further investigate the tim e course of ketanserin  treatment on DRN Glu, 
one-way ANOV A was run on each time point. Thes e analyses indicated that ketanserin 
altered Glu level 1 to 3 hours after clorgyline and paroxetine injection ( p < 0.05). Post 
hoc comparisons indicated that ketanserin decreased glutamate on the 2nd hour after 
clorgyline and paroxetine administration ( p < 0.05, Scheffe’s test). 
Similarly, ketanserin pretreated 30 min be fore clorgyline and paroxetine challenge 
injection attenuated the Glu increase in the MRN. Two-way repeated ANOV A showed 
that ketanserin had a signif icant effect on glutamate leve l induced by CLG and PRX as 
demonstrated by the significant effect of time (F 8, 96 = 3.0, p < 0.01) and treatment × time 
(F16, 96 = 2.6, p < 0.01), but not treatment (F 2, 12 = 3.5, p > 0.05). Post hoc comparisons 
showed ketanserin did not significantly re duced the increase in glutamate efflux ( p > 0.05, 
Scheffe’s test). To further investigate the tim e course of ketanserin  treatment on DRN Glu, 
one-way ANOV A was run on each time point. Thes e analyses indicated that ketanserin 
altered Glu level 1 to 3 hours after clorgyline and paroxetine injection ( p < 0.05). Post 
hoc comparisons indicated that ketanserin re duced the increased glutamate 1 to 3 hours 
after clorgyline and pa roxetine administration ( p < 0.05, Scheffe’s test). 
  148Effects of ketanserin and MK801 on head shakes and behavioral score of the 
severe syndrome  
The hypothesis that circuit between mPFC and raphe nuc lei was also responsible 
for the head shaking behavior and other sy mptoms of the severe 5-HT syndrome which 
was tested by disrupting the circuit with systemic injection of ketanserin and MK801. 
Ketanserin pretreatment significantly decreased the number of head shakes as demonstrated by independent-samples T-test (F = 10.8,  p < 0.01) (Fig. 29a), but failed to 
inhibit behavioral score as demonstrated  by independent-samples T-test (F = 1.086,  p > 
0.05) (Fig. 29b). MK801 failed to reduce the frequency of the head shakes (F = 1.9, p > 
0.05) (Fig. 29c) or behavioral score (F = 0.053, p > 0.05) (Fig. 29d). 
 
Effects on hyperthermia of the severe 5-HT syndrome by a local disruption of 
the circuit between raphe and mPFC 
The circuit hypothesis tested  in the last section was mainly using systemic 
approach. However, systemic injection of antagonists has the nonselective effect on many 
brain areas. To further test the circuit hypot hesis, selective disr uption techniques were 
employed by a direct reverse microdialysis infusion of receptor antagonists into the 
mPFC or raphe nuclei. 
Compared to the control, local perfusion of 0.3 mM ketanserin in the mPFC with 
dual-probe microdialysis signifi cantly blocked the hyperthermia  of the severe syndrome 
animals (Fig. 30a). Two-way repeated ANOV A s howed that local perfusion of ketanserin 
into mPFC had the significant effect on the T
cor induced by CLG and PRX as 
demonstrated by the significant effect of treatment (F 2, 20 = 20.7, p < 0.001), time (F 8, 160  149= 6.6, p < 0.001) and treatment × time (F 16, 160  = 6.0, p < 0.001). Post hoc  comparisons 
showed ketanserin significantly blocked the hyperthermia ( p < 0.001, Scheffe’s test). To 
further investigate the time course of ketanserin treatment on Tcor, one-way ANOV A was 
run on each time point. These analyses indicated that ketanserin altered Tcor 1 to 6 hours 
after clorgyline and paroxetine injection ( p < 0.01). Post hoc  comparisons indicated that 
ketanserin decreased Tcor 6 hours after clorgyline and paroxetine administration ( p < 0.01, 
Scheffe’s test). 
Consistently, local perfusion U73122 (50 µM), a PLC inhibitor disrupting the 
5-HT 2A receptor intracel lular singling, also blocked th e hyperthermia of the syndrome 
(Fig. 30b). Two-way repeated ANOV A showed that local perfusion of PLC inhibitor 
U73122 into mPFC had si gnificant effect on the Tcor induced by CLG and PRX as 
demonstrated by the significant effect of treatment (F 2, 14 = 7.5, p < 0.01), time (F 6, 84 = 
3.1, p < 0.01) and treatment × time (F 12, 84 = 4.8, p < 0.001). Post hoc  analyses showed 
U73122 significant blocked the hyperthermia ( p < 0.001, Scheffe’s test). To further 
investigate the time course of U73122 treatment on Tcor, one-way ANOV A was run on 
each time point. These analyses  indicated that U73122 altered Tcor 1 to 3 hours after 
clorgyline and paroxetine injection ( p < 0.05). Post hoc  comparisons indicated that 
U73122 decreased Tcor on the 1 and 2 hours after clorgyline and paroxetine 
administration ( p < 0.05, Scheffe’s test). 
Next, synapse sites at the DRN and MRN were disrupted by dual-probe 
microdialysis. Local perfusion of 1 mM MK801 into the DRN and MRN blocked the 
hyperthermia of the severe syndrome (Fig. 30c ). It was demonstrated by the significant 
effect of treatment (F 2, 14 = 6.4, p < 0.05), time (F 7, 98 = 3.9, p < 0.01) and treatment ×  150time (F 14, 98 = 5.5, p < 0.001). Post hoc analyses showed MK801 si gnificant inhibited the 
hyperthermia ( p < 0.05, Scheffe’s test). To further i nvestigate the time course of U73122 
treatment on Tcor, one-way ANOV A was run on each time point. These analyses indicated 
that MK801 altered Tcor 2 to 5 hours after clorgyline  and paroxetine injection ( p < 0.05). 
Post hoc  comparisons indicated that MK801 decreased Tcor 2 and 5 hours after clorgyline 
and paroxetine administration ( p < 0.05, Scheffe’s test). In a control study, blocking either 
site of the DRN or MRN alone with a single reverse microdialysis probe had no effect on 
hyperthermia.  
 
Effects on 5-HT efflux of a local disr uption of the circuit between raphe and 
mPFC in animals with the severe syndrome  
It was proposed that excessive 5-HT fo r evoking the severe syndrome would be 
reduced after a local disruption of the circ uit by microdialysis re verse perfusion of 
receptor antagonists such as ketanserin into  the cortex or MK801 into the raphe. As 
shown in Figure31a, bilateral infusion of 300µ M ketanserin into the mPFC significantly 
reduced 5-HT efflux in the mPFC (Fig. 31a) of the severe 5-HT syndrome animals as 
demonstrated by the significant effect of treatment (F 2, 13 = 18.3, p < 0.001), time (F 8, 104 
= 25.0, p < 0.001) and treatment × time (F 16, 104  = 11.3, p < 0.001). Post hoc  analyses 
showed ketanserin significant reduced the increased 5-HT ( p < 0.01, Scheffe’s test). To

was run on each time point. These analyses indi cated that ketanserin altered 5-HT level 
on the 6 hours after clorgyline and paroxetine injection ( p < 0.01). Post hoc  comparisons 
indicated that keta nserin decreased Tcor on the 6 hours after clorgyline and paroxetine  151administration ( p < 0.05, Scheffe’s test). 
Local perfusion of ketanserin (300 µM) in to mPFC reduced increased 5-HT in the 
POA of the severe 5-HT syndrome animals as demonstrated by the si gnificant effect of 
treatment (F 2, 11 = 35.8, p < 0.001), time (F 8, 88 = 51.4, p < 0.001) and treatment × time 
(F16, 88 = 18.9, p < 0.001). Post hoc  analyses showed ketanserin significantly reduced 
increased 5-HT in the POA ( p < 0.01, Scheffe’s test). To further investigate the time 
course of ketanserin perfusion on 5-HT, one-way ANOV A was run on each time point. 
These analyses indicated that ketanserin alte red 5-HT level on the 6 hours after clorgyline 
and paroxetine injection ( p < 0.01). Post hoc  comparisons indicated that ketanserin 
decreased Tcor on 3 to 6 hours after clorgyline and paroxetine administration ( p < 0.05, 
Scheffe’s test). 
To verify the involvement of the 5-HT 2A receptor in the circuit, U73122, a PLC 
inhibitor, was bilaterally infused into the mP FC (Fig. 31c). As expected, local perfusion 
of U73122 (50 µM) into mPFC reduced increased  5-HT in the mPFC of the severe 5-HT 
syndrome animals as demonstrated by th e significant effect  of treatment (F 2, 19 = 63.1, p < 
0.001), time (F 8, 152 = 51.4, p < 0.001) and treatment × time (F 16, 152  = 26.6, p < 0.001). 
Post hoc analyses showed U73122 significant redu ced increased 5-HT in the mPFC ( p < 
0.001, Scheffe’s test). To further investigat e the time course of U73122 perfusion on 
5-HT efflux, one-way ANOV A was run on each ti me point. These analyses indicated that 
ketanserin altered 5-HT level 6 hours af ter clorgyline and pa roxetine injection ( p < 0.01). 
Post hoc  comparisons indicated that ketanserin  reduced 5-HT 1 to 4 and 6 hours after 
clorgyline and paroxetine administration ( p < 0.05, Scheffe’s test). 
  152Similarly, Local perfusion of U73122 (50 µM) into mPFC reduced increased 5-HT 
in the POA of the severe 5-HT syndrome animals as demonstrated by the significant effect of treatment (F
2, 11 = 38.3, p < 0.001), time (F 8, 88 = 30.4, p < 0.001) and treatment 
× time (F 16, 88 = 10.2, p < 0.001).  Post hoc analyses showed U73122 significant reduced 
increased 5-HT in the POA ( p < 0.05, Scheffe’s test) (Fig. 31d) . To further investigate the 
time course of U73122 perfusion on 5-HT, one -way ANOV A was run on each time point. 
These analyses indicated that ketanserin alte red 5-HT level on the 6 hours after clorgyline 
and paroxetine injection ( p < 0.01). Post hoc  comparisons indicated that U73122 reduced 
5-HT on the second and third hours after cl orgyline and paroxetine administration ( p < 
0.05, Scheffe’s test). 
Next, the synaptic sites of the circuit at the DRN and MRN were disrupted with 
the noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist  MK801. Again as predicted, dual-probe 
infusion of MK801 (1 mM) into the DRN and MRN significantly attenuated the 
increased 5-HT in the mPFC (Fig. 31e). It wa s demonstrated by the significant effect of 
treatment (F 2, 17 = 73.8, p < 0.001), time (F 8, 136 = 75.3, p < 0.001) and treatment × time 
(F16, 136  = 28.3, p < 0.001). Post hoc  analyses showed MK801 significantly reduced 
increased 5-HT in the POA ( p < 0.01, Scheffe’s test). To further investigate the time 
course of MK801 perfusion on 5-HT, one-w ay ANOV A was run on each time point. 
These analyses indicated that MK801 altere d 5-HT level on the 6 hours after clorgyline 
and paroxetine injection ( p < 0.001). Post hoc  comparisons indicated that MK801 
reduced 5-HT on the 2 to 4 hours after cl orgyline and paroxetine administration ( p < 0.01, 
Scheffe’s test). 
Local perfusion of MK801 (1 mM) into DR N and MRN reduced increased 5-HT in  153the POA of the severe 5-HT syndrome animals as demonstrated by the significant effect 
of treatment (F 2, 11 = 63.0, p < 0.001), time (F 8, 88 = 75.3, p < 0.001) and treatment × time 
(F16, 88 = 11.1, p < 0.001). Post hoc  analyses showed MK801 significant reduced 
increased 5-HT in the POA ( p < 0.01, Scheffe’s test) (Fig. 31f). To further investigate the 
time course of MK801 perfusion on 5-HT, one -way ANOV A was run on each time point. 
These analyses indicated that MK801 alte red 5-HT level 6 hours after clorgyline and 
paroxetine injection ( p < 0.01). Post hoc  comparisons indicated that MK801 reduced 
5-HT 2 to 6 hours after clorgyline and paroxetine administration ( p < 0.05, Scheffe’s 
test). 
 
Effect on glutamate of a local disruption of the circuit with ketanserin in the 
mPFC of animals with the severe syndrome  
Glutamate in the DRN and MRN was determin ed using microdialysis in rats with 
the severe syndrome induced by paroxetine co mbined with clorgyline. As shown in 
Figure 32a, bilateral infusion of ketanserin  (0.3 mM) into the mPFC significantly 
attenuated the increased glutamate in the DR N as demonstrated by the significant effect 
of treatment (F , 13 = 0.9, p > 0.05), time (F 8, 104 = 3.9, p < 0.001) and treatment × time (F 8, 
104 = 2.0, p > 0.05). Post hoc analyses showed ketanserin did not significantly reduced 
increased glutamate in the DRN ( p < 0.01, Scheffe’s test). To further investigate the time 
course of ketanserin perfusion on glutam ate, one-way ANOV A was run on each time 
point. These analyses indicated that ketanserin redu ced glutamate level on the first hour 
after clorgyline and paroxetine injection ( p < 0.001, Scheffe’s test). 
Although there was a tendency of local ke tanserin to attenuate the increased  154glutamate in the MRN, the effect failed to re ach statistical signifi cance (Fig. 32b). Local 
perfusion of ketanserin (300 µM) into mPFC reduced increased 5-HT in the POA of the 
severe 5-HT syndrome animals as demonstrated  by the insignificant effect of treatment 
(F1, 8 = 1.6, p > 0.05) and treatment × time (F 8, 64 = 2.2, p > 0.05) ), but not time (F 8, 64 = 
3.0, p < 0.01). Post hoc  analyses showed ketanserin di d not reduced increased glutamate 
in the MRN ( p < 0.01, Scheffe’s test). To further inve stigate the time course of ketanserin 
perfusion on glutamate, one-way ANOV A wa s run on each time point. These analyses 
indicated that ketanserin did not redu ced glutamate level at any time point ( p > 0.05, 
Scheffe’s test). 
 
Effects on the head shake and behavioral  score of a local disruption of the 
circuit between raphe and mPFC in rats with the severe syndrome  
Bilateral infusion of ketanserin (0.3 mM ) into the mPFC had no effect on head 
shakes (F = 0 .003, p > 0.05; Fig. 33a) or beha vioral score (F = 3.9, p > 0.05; Fig. 33b) 
evoked by challenge injection of paroxe tine combined with clorgyline in the 
clorgyline-pretreated animals. Simila rly, bilateral perfusion of U73122 (50 μM) into the 
mPFC did not reduce the numbe r of head shakes (F = 0.014, p > 0.05; Fig. 33c) or 
behavioral score (F = 3.9, p > 0.05; Fig. 33d). MK801 (1 mM) infusion into the DRN and 
MRN had no significant effect on the number of the head shaking behavior (F = 3.5, p > 
0.05; Fig. 33e) or beha vioral score (F = 3.6, p > 0.05; Fig. 33f).  
 
   155Effects on the mortality rate of di srupting circuit between the raphe and 
mPFC in rats with the severe syndrome 
As shown in Table 16, the mortality rate occurred in the severe syndrome animals 
without an antagonist. In contrast, all animals survived after pretreatment with systemic 
ketanserin (5 mg/kg, i.p.) or  MK801 (0.25 mg/kg, i.p.). Next , the circuit between raphe 
and mPFC was disrupted with microdialysis  reverse infusion of receptor antagonists. 
Similarly, the mortality occurred in the severe syndrome animals without an antagonist local perfusion. The death rate was reduced to  zero after infusion of ketanserin (0.3 mM) 
into the mPFC or MK801 (1mM) into the DRN and MRN. U73122 (50 µM) infusion into the mPFC into the DRN and MRN also reduced  the mortality rate (Table 16).      1565.4 Discussion 
 
The main result of this study was that disrupting the circu it between the raphe 
(DRN and MRN) and mPFC alle viated the severe syndrome and prevented the mortality. 
The observation was deduced from systemic inje ction of receptor antagonists and verified 
with local disruption of the circ uit between the raphe and mPFC.  
 The circuit  between the raphe and mPFC was re-evaluated with microdialysis 
approach. The data obtained in Figure 25 confirmed the findings of anatomical and 
electrophysiological studies, supporting that the circuit consists of 5-HT 2A receptors in 
the mPFC and glutamate receptors in the raphe (Wilson and Molliver, 1991; Lee et al., 2003; Aghajanian and Marek, 1999; Martin-Ruiz et al., 2001; Celada P et al., 2001). DOI, 
a 5-HT
2A receptor agonist, in the mPFC incr eased glutamate in the DRN and MRN. 
Consistently, NMDA infusion in the DRN or MRN increased 5-HT in the mPFC (Fig. 25). 
These results verify the circuit between th e mPFC and raphe nuclei, supporting that 
5-HT 2A receptor in mPFC and NMDA receptor in  the DRN and MRN involve the circuit.  
 With this new animal model of 5-HT syndrome,  blocking 5-HT 2A receptors with 
systemic ketanserin reduced the severity of th e syndrome, similar to that described in the 
previous studies (Nisijima et al., 2001; Ma et  al., 2008). Systemic ketanserin prevented 
the hyperthermia and reduced the increased 5- HT efflux in the mPFC in rats with the 
severe syndrome. In chapter four, it wa s found that hyperthermia was significantly 
elicited as the increased 5-HT exceeded 30-fo ld from the baseline. After pretreatment 
with ketanserin, however, 5-HT was redu ced to 20-fold and animals displayed 
hypothermia (Fig. 26; 27a). It is we ll established th at activation 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 1A  157receptors induce hyperthermia and hypothermia, respectively (Faure et al., 2006; Hjorth, 
1985; Lin and Chuang, 2002; Hedlund et al., 200 4). It is likely that ketanserin 
pretreatment compromises the function of 5-HT 2A receptor and, thus, the activity of the 
5-HT 1A receptor on the decrease in  body temperature will be e nhanced indirectly (Ma et 
al., 2008). So the hypothermia was observed in this study.  
Present study showed that glutamate efflux was increased in the DRN and MRN in 
the severe syndrome (Fig. 28). Based on our ci rcuit hypothesis, it can be interpreted that 
glutamatergic neurons in the mPFC have  been excited by activation of the 5-HT 2A 
receptor, releasing glutamate in the axon terminals such as DRN and MRN. Systemic ketanserin pretreatment reduced the incr eased glutamate in DRN and MRN, supporting 
our hypothesis that 5-HT
2A receptor mediates the increased glutamate. 
Head shake is a characteristic behavi or induced by activation of the 5-HT 2A 
receptor. In this study, the number of head sh akes was significantly reduced by ketanserin 
pretreatment in rats with th e severe syndrome (Fig. 29). This was coincident with the 
reduced increase in 5-HT and co mpromised function of the 5-HT 2A receptor. Since 
behaviors as stated in the behavi oral score are mediated by the 5-HT 1A receptor, it was 
not surprising that ketanserin did not have the effect on the behavioral scor e. It suggests 
that extracellular 5-HT, reduced by ketanserin pretreatment, is sufficient to excite the 
5-HT 1A receptor. 
As described previously in  the literature (Nis ijima et al., 2004; Ma et al., 2008), 
systemic injection of MK801 alleviated th e severe syndrome. Based on our circuit 
hypothesis, glutamate released in the DR N and MRN activated NMDA receptors on 
serotonergic neurons. To test this hypothesi s, MK801was given to ra ts with the severe  158syndrome induced by paroxetine combined w ith clorgyline. Similar to ketanserin, 
MK801 prevented the hyperthermia (Fig. 26) and reduced the increas ed 5-HT (Fig. 27). 
Figure 26 showed that the duration of th e hypothermia was very short in the MK801 
pretreatment group in contrast to the animal s pretreated with ketanserin. The underlying 
reason may be the slowly elevated  5-HT which activates the 5-HT 1A receptor 
predominately at the initial stage for its high affinity to 5-HT, causing hypothermia. 
When extracellular 5-HT was beyond 10-fold, 5-HT 2A receptors started to be activated 
for heat gain. In contrast, 5-HT 2A receptors in the ketanserin  group would not be activated 
to increase the body temperature and, thus, the 5-HT 1A receptor was always 
predominating for heat loss, resulting in the long lasting hypothermia.  
MK801 pretreatment in rats with the se vere syndrome also has a tendency of 
reducing the number of head shakes and behavioral score. However, there was no 
statistical significance. Two possible reasons  account for these results. First, the 
postsynaptic NMDA receptor is not involved in the head shakes and syndrome signs used 
for the behavioral score, and the decrease in 5-HT by disrupting the circuit was not 
sufficient to reduce the head shakes  or signs of syndrome caused by 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A 
receptors. Second, MK801 alone induces locomotion, stereotyped sniffing and ataxia in rats (Andine et al., 1999), which might interfer e with the behavioral performances in the 
5-HT syndrome animals. Despite this, there wa s a slight decrease in the number of head 
shakes and behavioral score. This effect mi ght result from the decrease in 5-HT level 
relevant to MK801 pretreatment.   
To further test the role of the circuit in  the severe syndrome, synaptic connections 
were selectively blocked by local infusion of  receptor antagonists. In agreement with  159systemic administration, local perfusion of ketanserin into the mPFC blocked 
hyperthermia (Fig. 30) and reduced the increas ed 5-HT in the mPFC and POA (Fig. 31). 
The effect of disruption of 5-HT 2A receptors was also tested using U73122 by blocking 
the 5-HT 2A receptor-coupled PLC activity. It was found that U73122 in the mPFC 
prevented the hyperthermia and increased 5- HT in rats challenged with paroxetine 
combined with clorgyline. Moreover, keta nserin infusion in the mPFC reduced the 
increased glutamate in the DRN and MRN (F ig. 30). These results suggests that the 
5-HT 2A receptor in the mPFC is critical fo r the progress of the severe syndrome. 
Interestingly, both ketanserin and U73122 in the mPFC have no effects on the number of 
head shakes, which suggests that the 5-HT 2A receptor in the mPFC is  not the target that 
mediates the head shakes elicited by 5-HT 2A receptors. 
Based on the circuit hypothesis, DRN a nd MRN contain serotonergic neurons 
receiving glutamatergic afferents from the mPFC. MK801 infusion into the DRN and 
MRN blocked the hyperthermia and the increas ed 5-HT in the mPFC and POA of rats 
challenged with paroxetine combined with  clorgyline for inducing the severe 5-HT 
syndrome. Besides NMDA receptor, Glu AMPA and KA receptors also exist in the DRN 
and MRN neurons (Gartside, et al., 2007). It will be interes ting to explore the role of 
AMPA and KA receptors as well as the receptor-mediated calcium release on the circuit.  
 Interestingly, ketanserin or MK801 inhibite d 50-70% of the increased 5-HT in rats 
with the severe syndrome (Fig. 31). It suggest s that 5-HT efflux relevant to the syndrome 
consists of two components: primary and second ary. Primary efflux is due to inhibition of 
5-HT uptake and degradation at the axon te rminals by the antidepressants. When the 
antidepressant-mediated primary 5-HT releas e reaches a certain level, it will induce a  160secondary 5-HT efflux by the positive-fee dback loop between the mPFC and raphe. 
Ketanserin and MK801 disrupted the circu it between mPFC and raphe, resulting in 
reducing the secondary component (Figure 34). 
The primary component induced by clorgylin e and paroxetine could not be blocked 
by ketanserin and MK801. This component is  responsible for benign signs of the 
syndrome (e.g., tremor, forepaw treading, immo bility, hindlimb a bduction, upright tail 
and head shakes). In support, local disruption of the circuit did not have an effect on the 
aforementioned behavioral signs. The second component is strongl y associated with 
syndrome progression from benign to malignant , manifested by hypert hermia and death. 
Altogether, 5-HT efflux in the mPFC of the severe 5-HT syndrome animals results 
from two distinct mechanisms: (1) the prim ary efflux results from the manipulation of 
5-HT synthesis/metabolic pathway, which repr esents a direct effect of antidepressants on 
the axon terminal. The primary efflux is a ssociated with the benign syndrome although 
the signs of the syndrome can be mild, modera te or severe; (2) th e secondary efflux is 
evoked through the positive feedback loop be tween mPFC and raphe nuclei (DRN and 
MRN) as elucidated in Figure 34. It can be  concluded that the secondary efflux is 
associated with the malignant syndrome,  showing hyperthermia and death due to 
activation of 5-HT 2A receptor-mediated positive fee dback circuit between cortical 
glutamatergic and raphe serotonergic neurons.

Glutamatergic neurons in the mPFC contain the 5-HT 2A receptor. Serotonergic neurons in 
the raphe have glutamate receptors (e.g., NMDA  receptor). There are interconnections or 
circuits between the two areas. One of the circuits is a positi ve-feedback loop as 
described in this Figure  since both NMDA and 5-HT 2A receptors are excitatory. 
Activation of 5-HT 2A receptor in the mPFC increases glutamate release in the DRN and 
MRN. Glutamate, in turn, excites serotonerg ic neurons by binding NMDA receptor in the 
raphe nuclei and then increases a 5-HT releas e in the mPFC as well as other brain areas 
such as preoptic area (POA) receiving raphe projection. In a 5-HT syndrome, monoamine 
oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and selective se rotonin reuptake inhi bit (SSRI) induce a 
primary 5-HT release by inhibiting 5-HT reuptake and degradation. As a result, the 
primary 5-HT efflux activates 5-HT 2A receptors in the mPFC for a secondary 5-HT 
release by activating this circuit. Activation of the circuit likely results in a malignant 
5-HT syndrome by excessive 5-HT efflux in the brain.  185Table 14. Drug dose, solvent and route of administration used in chapter five

CHAPTER SIX: CONCLUS ION AND SIGNIFICANCE 
 
Serotonin syndrome has become a clinical  problem in medicine over the past 
decades due to the wide prescription of serotonin-selective psychotropic agents, 
especially antidepressants (Sternbach, 1991; Gillman, 1999, 2006; Bodner et al., 1995). 
Given the potential life-threatening nature a nd high incident rate of the syndrome as well 
as the myriad of drugs manipulating the 5-HT  system (Ener et al., 2003), it is imperative 
to take a close examination of the syndrome.  Both clinical and lab researches have 
demonstrated that the 5-HT 2A receptor mediates some symp toms of the malignant 5-HT 
syndrome, such as hyperthermia and death (N isijima et al., 2001; Is bister and Whyte, 
2002), but the underlying mechanism remains unavailable. To fill the gap, my study 
tested the roles of 5-HT 2A receptor on the etiology of the malignant 5-HT syndrome. 
There are two main conclusions from my research: (1) Increase in the 5-HT 2A receptor 
activity or sensitivity is the precondition of  inducing a malignant 5-HT syndrome; (2) 
The sensitized 5-HT 2A receptor caused a malignant 5-HT syndrome by initiating a 
feedback circuit between the mPFC a nd raphe nuclei (DRN and MRN).   
The first aim of my study was to examine the role of 5-HT 2A receptor activity in a 
malignant 5-HT syndrome. It was hypothesized that the 5-HT 2A receptor was sensitized 
in the antidepressant treatment and thereafter excessive increases in 5-HT activated the 
sensitized receptor for the ma lignant syndrome. To test th is hypothesis, a new animal  189model of the syndrome was developed in th e study. Interestingly, it was found that the 
symptoms of the malignant 5-HT syndrome were  elicited in the chro nic animals receiving 
clorgyline for 3 or 6 days, but not in the drug naïves. There was no difference in 5-HT 
level between the acute and chronic groups challenged with clorgy line combined with 
paroxetine, which excluded the e ffect of 5-HT level on the 5-HT 2A receptor functions. 
The data suggests that chronic clorgyline treatment increases the 5-HT 2A receptor activity 
and, thereafter, the sensitized 5-HT 2A receptor evoke a malignant 5-HT syndrome. 
Moreover, the conclusion was confir med by ketanserin, a selective 5-HT 2A receptor 
antagonist, which could alleviate the maligna nt syndrome to a mild one. Another finding 
from this study was that chronic cl orgyline treatment desensitized the 5-HT 1A receptor 
activity. Since 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A receptors are usually to exert opposite functions, the 
reduced activity of the 5-HT 1A receptor would in turn potentiate the activity of 5-HT 2A 
receptor indirectly.   
To the best of our knowledge, this study wa s the first report in the 5-HT syndrome 
research with examining the 5-HT receptor act ivity relevant to antidepressant exposure. 
Clinical investigation indicated  that patients with a 5-HT s yndrome have a long history of 
taking antidepressants (Hegerl et al., 1998) . Based on our study, the underlying reason 
may be the increased sensitivity of the 5-HT 2A receptor. Moreover, the results of our 
study may serve as a safeguard for both the doctor prescribing antid epressants and the 
patients receiving these compounds that an tidepressants could increase the 5-HT 2A 
receptor activity and the suscep tibility to this adverse effect. In this present study, my 
study just tested the role of chr onic exposure to clorgyline on the 5-HT 2A receptor activity. 
In fact, a great number of antidepressants w ith various pharmacological properties are be  190using in patients. In the future work, it shoul d clarify the role of each antidepressant on 
the 5-HT 2A receptor activity. If an antidepressant  has the ability of increasing 5-HT 2A 
receptor activity, it is better for doctor to switch the compound to another substitute or 
keep monitoring the patient’s responses. In th e future, it is also necessary to clarify the 
mechanisms behind the antidepress ant-induced change in the 5-HT 2A receptor, for 
example, receptor protein density, functi onal activity and in tracellular signal 
transduction.  
Besides the chronic antidepressant exposur e, the role of ambient temperature on 
the 5-HT 2A receptor activity was also explored. My  data stated that warm and cold 
ambient temperature could potentiate and inhibit the 5-HT 2A receptor activity, 
respectively, in the 5-HT syndrome animals.  A great number of studies indicated that 
warm and cold ambient temperature could pot entiate and alleviate 5-HT-related toxic 
responses (e.g., hyperthermia, death) (Malberg  and Seiden, 1998; Miller and O'Callaghan, 
2003), respectively, but the mechanisms behind it was unclear before my study. Our data 
revealed that the change in the HT 2A receptor activity might at  least in part account for 
the variation of the 5-HT toxicity due to di fferent environmental te mperature. Clinically, 
it should be cautious for people recei ving the serotonergic compounds (e.g., 
antidepressants, MDMA) to st ay in the hot environment. On the other hand, cold 
measures could be used to alleviate patients with the 5-HT syndrome. In the further work, 
it is neccessary to clarify the connection be tween the ambient temperature and the 5-HT 2A 
receptor activity. To date, many studies have stated that ambient temperature could alter 
the autonomic nerve system activity and hor mone secretion (Leppaluoto et al., 1988; 
Quintanar-Stephano et al., 1991). The thermo sensitive hormones may serve the bridge  191that connects the ambient temperature and 5-HT 2A receptor activity. However, further 
studies are needed to elucidate it.     
The second major aim of my study was to explore how the sensitized 5-HT 2A 
receptor induced a malignant 5-HT syndrome. Our data showed that the 5-HT 2A receptor 
expressed in the mPFC exacerbated the 5-HT  syndrome by initiating circuits between the 
mPFC and raphe nuclei (DRN and MRN). The circuits between raphe and mPFC have 
been thoroughly investigated by several labor atories including from  Sharp, Artigas and 
Aghajanian. It has been deemed that the ci rcuits are glutamatergic in the cortex and 
serotonergic in the raphe, forming feedb ack loops between these two locations and 
contributes to the pathophysiology and treatmen t of the psychiatric diseases, such as the 
major depression. One of my projects was based on the circuit and explor ed its role in the 
malignant 5-HT syndrome. First, our data indicated that disrup tion of the circuit 
alleviated the syndrome from malignant to be nign. It suggests that the circuit mediates 
the malignant 5-HT syndrome. Second, gl utamate and/or glutamate-mediated Ca2+ 
channels in the DRN and MRN play a crucial role  in the circuit. It appears that not only 
5-HT, but also glutamate or Ca2+ channels involve in the malignant 5-HT syndrome. 
Third, 5-HT efflux elicited by antidepressant s (primary release) and the circuit 
(secondary release) have different functi ons. The former involves a benign 5-HT 
syndrome, and the later mediates a malignant  syndrome. In this study, we only tested 
5-HT level in the mPFC and POA. Obviousl y, all the neural stru ctures in the brain 
receiving projections from the DRN and MRN, if not all, should have two components of 
5-HT in the malignant 5-HT syndrome cases. Th e last and most impor tant finding is that 
the circuit is triggered primarily by excessive 5-HT on the 5-HT 2A receptors in the mPFC.  192In the chapter one, it was found that excessi ve 5-HT could not induce a malignant 5-HT 
syndrome in the drug-naïve animals. It sugge sts that in the normal circumstance the 
5-HT 2A receptor-mediated circuit does not have a sensitized activity as seen in the 
malignant 5-HT syndrome. Malignant 5-HT syndrome happened in rats receiving chronic 
clorgyline treatment or housed in warm ambien t temperature. It suggests that sensitized 
5-HT 2A receptor is an important factor for ini tiating the circuit. A nother finding in this 
chapter is that we indent ify the synaptic connection on which MK801 acts. Lines of 
evidence have proved that glutamatergic NM DA receptor antagonist could alleviate the 
severe 5-HT syndrome (Nisijima et al., 2004; Ma et al., 2008), however the targets have 
not been reported. Our study demonstrated th at serotonergic neurons in the DRN and 
MRN contain the receptor targets for the NMDA receptor antagonist to against the 
malignant 5-HT syndrome. Clinically, base d on our study on the circuit, besides 5-HT 2A 
receptor in the mPFC, disrupting glutamatergic NMDA receptor is another way to 
prevent the exacerbation of the syndrome. Seve ral circuits have been proposed between 
the mPFC and raphe nuclei (Sharp et al., 2007 ). The circuit consists  of glutamatergic, 
GABAergic and serotonergic neurons. The receptors in this circuit include, but not 
limited to, NMDA, 5-HT 2A, 5-HT 1A, GABA A and GABA B receptors (Celada et al., 2001). 
It is possible that Glu from  mPFC enhances GABA release in the raphe by activating 
GABAergic neurons. GABA would likely inhi bit the serotonergic neurons. It is 
interesting to test GABA level in the raphe as  well as in the mPFC of the 5-HT syndrome 
animals. Unfortunately, no data were reporte d to date. In the present study, the 5-HT 2A 
receptor on the cortical glutamatergic neurons and the NMDA receptor on the raphe 
serotonergic neurons were examined. In the fu ture work, it is necessary to examine other  193components (e.g., GABAergic interneurons) in the circuit on th e etiology of the 
malignant 5-HT syndrome.   
In summary, the underlying mechanism for an excessive 5-HT-evoked 5-HT 
syndrome was outlined in Figure 35. Chroni c clorgyline treatment and increase in 
environmental temperature could increase the activity of 5-HT 2A receptor. The challenge 
injection of paroxetine co mbined with clorgyline woul d dose-dependently elicit an 
excessive increase in 5-HT, causing mild, m oderate and severe 5-HT syndromes. The 
severe syndrome rarely occurs, resulting from the activation of the sensitized 5-HT 2A 
receptors in the circuit betw een mPFC and raphe (DRN and MRN). The efflux of 5-HT in 
the mPFC induced by antidepressants is primary, activating glutamatergic neurons 
through the 5-HT 2A receptor. Then, serotonergic ne urons in DRN and MRN receiving 
mPFC glutamatergic efferent are excited to release glutam ate which in turn activate 
serotonergic neurons for re leasing extra 5-HT in mPFC  as well as other regions. 
Therefore, this is a positive feedback ci rcuit between the mPFC  and raphe (DRN and 
MRN) resulting in excessive 5-HT and a ggravating the syndrome (e.g., hyperthermia and 
death). This study, by focusing on 5-HT 2A receptor in the circu it and its response to 
antidepressant treatment as well as environmental temperature, reveals new 
neuropathological and pharmacological m echanisms underlying the etiology of the 
malignant 5-HT syndrome and, further, pr ovides a sound basis for future work.   194

Chronic clorgyline (CLG) treatment and increase in ambient temperature ( Tamb) enhance 
the activity of 5-HT 2A receptors. Challenge injection of paroxetine (PRX) combined with 
clorgyline causes an excessive increase in 5-HT  efflux in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) 
and induces a severe 5-HT syndrome by initiating a 5-HT 2A receptor-mediated circuit 
between mPFC and dorsal and median raphe nuclei (DRN and MRN). 5-HT accumulated in preoptic area (POA) may induce the hype rthermia. Excitation of mPFC neurons 
increases the glutamate release in the brain. The excessive 5-HT elicits a severe 5-HT 
syndrome manifested by hyperthermia and even death.   196
