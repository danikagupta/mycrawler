Abstract: A Novel bacterial sp namely Kurthia were isolated from textile dye effluent.  The 
ability of isolated  Kurthia sp to decolorize the three triphenyl  methane dyes namely Crystal 
violet, Melachite green, Brillant green, Triarylmethane dyes, Bromothymol blue, Basic fuchsin, 
phenol red were observed with lower and higher concentration of dyes.  The decolourization studies were performed on hourly basis and daily basis and Dissolved O xygen values were 
estimated for Kurthi sp  and they are treated and untreated synthetic dye solutions.  It was 
observed that complete decolourization occurred within 48 hours with 10ppm and 20pp m of the 
three dyes. 0ppm and 40 ppm of Crystal violet was degraded  upto 98%  and 94%, respe ctively 
in 72 hours. 30ppm of Malachite green and Brilliant green were degraded 100% within 48 hrs.  40ppm of Malachite green and Brilliant green were decolorized by 98% and 96% respecti vely in 
48 hrs. I t was observed that  100% decolourization of Crystal violet of 1ppm, 2ppm, 3ppm and 4 
ppm concentration occurred with 45, 90, 135, and 180 minutes, respectively.  Complete decolourization was noted in Malachite green and Brilliant green for concentration within time interval of 45 to 225 min.  6ppm of both Malachite green and Brilliant green was decolorized by 
98% within 270 minutes.   The Dissolved Oxygen values of  Malachite green and Crystal violet 
controls were 5.6ppm, 5.4ppm, 5.5ppm respectively.  The Dissolved Oxygen lev els of 
corresponding Kurthia treated cell free filtrate were 7.3ppm, 7.4ppm and 7.3ppm.

Introduction 
     Water pollution control is currently one of the major areas of scientific activity.  
Environmental regulation in many countries have made it mandatory to decolorize dye waste 
water prior to discharge into neighboring water bodies and waste treatment systems.  Dyes such as triphenylmethane dyes, triarylmethane  dyes, azo dyes, anthroquinone dyes and reactive dyes 
are released into the environmental in industrial effluents from tow major sources, the textile and 
the dye – stuff industries.  It is reported that 10 – 20 % of dyes are lost to waste water as a result  
of inefficient dyeing process.  
     Triphenylmethane dyes, Triarylmethane dyes are used extensively in textile industries for 
dyeing nylon, polyacrylonitrile modified nylon, wool, wool, silk and cotton.  Paper and leather

use different types of triphenylmethane dyes and triarylmethane dyes.  
     Presently most of the processes used for the treatment of dye waste are physiochemical 
processes such a adsorption, chemical precipitation and flocculation, oxidation by chlorine, 
hydrogen peroxide and ozone, electrolysis, reduction, electrochemical treatment and ion -pair 
extraction.  These method are costly less efficient and produce large amount of sludge.  Therefore a currently biological process have achieved greater attention as they are cost -effective 
environmental friendly and does not produce large quantity of sludge.  
     Biological decolorization of triphenylmethane dyes are widely reported in literature using 
bacteria, fungi, yeasts and actinomycetes.  Most of the studies were carried out on crystal violet.  
     Pseudomonas, Pseudomallei BNA, Mycobacterium ap., Corynebacterium sp., and Bacillus 
subtilis  are major bacterial species reported to degrade triphenylmethane dyes.  Decolorization  of 
these dyes is ex hibite d by several fungi such as Phanerochate chrysosporium, Capalash, N.., 
Sharma, P. (1992)  Coriolus versicolor, Cyathus bulleri, Cyathus striatus and Cyathus stercoreus.  
Actinomycetes l ike Nocardia globerula an Nocardia coralline  and yeasts such as Rhodotorula 
rubra  were also capable of degrading triphenylmethane dyes.  
     The biological decolorization of textile dye waste water was reported using  aerobic- anaerobic 
sequential batch or continuous flow reactors (Ganesh et al., 1994).  The decolorization of three triphenylmethane dyes namely Crystal violet, Bromophenol blue and Malachite green .  C.bulleri  
was found to be most efficient in decolorizati on.  C.bulleri  has been found to be  capable of 
decolorizing the crystal violet (Vasdev et al., 1995)  
     The decolorization of crystal violet was reported using three white rot fungi such as Corio Ius 
versicolor, Fumalia trogii and Phanerochaete chrysosporium  and one brown rot fungus 
Laetiporus suplhureus.  It was also reported that crystal violet was oxidized by commercial 
horseradish peroxidase.  A significant rate of oxidation was observed only when hydrogen peroxide was present. Without  hydrogen peroxide the enzyme had no effect on the decolorization of dye, thus suggesting that a it dependent enzyme is probable involved in th e 
oxidation of the dye (Yatoma  et al., 1995)  
     It was observed that different types of microorganisms such as bacteria, acti nomycetes, yeasts 
and fungi can decolourize and degrade different types of triphenylmethane dyes.  However, 
reports on complete mineralization is very much scanty.  There is no report on reduction of 
biochemical and chemical oxygen demand after decolouriza tion.(Azmi et al., 1998)  
     A Kurthia spp was selected on the basis of rapid decolorizing activity.  Under aerobic 
conditions, 98% color was removed intracellularly by this strain.  A number or triphenylmethane 
dyes such as Magenta, Crystal violet, Pararosaniline, Brilliant green Malachite greed,  Ethyl 
violet and textile and dyestuff effluent were use in this tudy.  The rates of decolorization of

http://www.ijser.org  Magenta(92%), Crystal violet (96%), Pararosaniline (96%), Brilliant green (100%) and 
Malachite greed (96%) were found to be  more than that of Ethyl viol et (8%) (Sani et al., 1998).  
The Caulobacter vibrioides  was discovered to degrade azo dyes (Mazumlder 1999).  
     It was found that Kurthia s pp had a great potential to transform different triphenylmethane 
dyes including synthetic and textile dyestuff eff luent to colorless compound.  In the case of 
crystal violet, the COD of effluent was reduced by 94.7% with Malachite green the COD of effluent was reduced by 93.2% and with Brilliant greed the COD was reduced by 88.2% (Azmi et al ., 1999).  
     Kurthia spp can be used as a decolorizing agent and for the removal of toxicity from effluent 
containing triphenylmethane dyes (Sani et al., 1999).  It does not exhibit extracellular 
decolourizing activity.  Cells are responsible for the biotransformation of Gentian violet o 
Leucogentian violet (Sani et al., 1999).  The rate of decolourizing of triphenylmethane deyes by Kurthia spp was higher in comparison to other organisms.  Moreover the biotransformation 
products of Crystal violet by all the strains were the same ( Sani et al., 1999).  
     Kurthia spp may be promising bacteria  to depollute the effluent containing  triophenylmethane 
dyes.  This strain can also decolorize synthetic effluent containing a mixture of different 
triphenylmethane dyes and textiles and dyestuf f effluent (sani et al., 1999).  
Material and methods  
Isolation of Kurthia spp  
Collection of Sample  
     Various effluent samples were collected from a textile dyeing industry, near cellular at 
Madurai city.  
Serial dilution  
     The effluent samples were serially diluted making 10 fold dilutions, 1ml of effluent sample 
was mixed with 99ml of sterile distilled water, in the conical flask, which gives dilution of 1/100.  The dilutions procedure was performed for upto dilution of 1/1000000.  The dilution samples 
were used for the isolation of kurthia spp. 
Primary culture technique  
     Banerjee medium was prepared with crystal violet at 2.5µg/ml concentration and poured in 
the petriplate at aseptic conditions 0.1ml of each diluted sample were spread over the surface of 
the plate using a sterile glass rod and incubated at 30
0 c for 2 4 hrs.  After incubation, the results 
were observed.  Organisms were selected on the basis of clear zone on agar plate.

     Kurthia spp was tentatively isolated from textile dye effluent surface colonies on yeast 
nutrient agar was usually rhizoid and had “medusa – head” appearance under low magnification.  
The isolated by microscopic,  biochemical examination.  Dye degradation activity wa s measured 
by using various concentrations of synthetic dye solutions prepared in our labouratory.  The dyes 
used were crystal violet, Malachite green, Brilliant green .  The degradation activity of Kurthia 
was studies on daily and hourly basis.  
     When d ecolourization was studied on day – basis, it was observed that complete 
decolourization occurred within 48 hours with 10ppm  and 20ppm of the three dyes.  10ppm  and 
40 ppm of Crystal violet was degrade upto 98%  and 94%, respectively in 72 hours.  Similarl y 
30ppm of Malachite green and Brilliant green were degraded 100% within 48 hrs.  40ppm of 
Malachite green and Brilliant green were decolorized by 98% and 96% respectively in 48 hrs.  
     When decolorization was studied on hourly basis, it was observed that 100% decolourization 
of Crystal violet of 1ppm, 2ppm, 3ppm and 4 ppm concentration occurred with 45, 90, 135, and 
180 minutes, respectively.  Complete decolourization was noted in Malachite green and Brilliant green for concentration within time interval  of 45 to 225 min.  6ppm of both Malachite green and 
Brilliant green was decolorized by 98% within 270 minutes.  
     The Dissolved Oxygen values of Malachite green and Crystal violet controls were 5.6ppm, 
5.4ppm, 5.5ppm respectively.  The Dissolved Oxygen levels of corresponding Kurthia treated 
cell free filtrate were 7.3ppm, 7.4ppm and 7.3ppm. Hence it may concluded that Kurthia spp it is 
a bacteria to depollute the effluent containing triphenylmethane dyes.  It is also a non -pathogenic 
biological agent for decolorizing textile dye waste water containing triphenylmethane dyes.  
     HPLC was performed in Kurthia  treated Triphenylmethane dyes.  The HPLC resultrs showed 
that chemical compound of triphenylmethane dyes were reduced and may be converted into C o
2, 
H2O2 as there were no other degraded products detected.
