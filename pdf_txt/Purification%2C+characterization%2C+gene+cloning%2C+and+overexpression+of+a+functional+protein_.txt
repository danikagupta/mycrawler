SIGNIFICANCE
Nitroimidazole pro-drugs represent a promising new class of anti-tuberc ulosis drugs. Reliable
methods to assure nitroimidazole susceptibility are critical to assure t heir optimal use. Yet, the
spectrum of nitroimidazole resistance mutations remains incompletely c haracterized. Using 161
pretomanid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates selected in pretomanid-treated mice,
we discovered a novel resistance determinant, Rv2983 , required for cofactor F 420biosynthesis

 nitroimidazole activation. We show that F 420H2–deficient nitroimidazole-resistant mutants are
hypersusceptible to the selective decontaminant malachite green used in solid media to isolate
mycobacteria and may evade detection on such media. These results have imp ortant implications
for development and clinical use of genotypic and phenotypic methods for n itroimidazole
susceptibility testing.
ABSTRACT
Delamanid represents one of two novel antimicrobial classes approved to treat tuberculosis in
over 40 years. Pretomanid is another promising nitroimidazole pro-drug in clinical development.
Characterization of the full spectrum of mutations conferring res istance to nitroimidazoles and 
their related phenotypes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis will inform development of suitable 
genotypic and phenotypic drug susceptibility tests. Here, we used a range of pretomanid doses
to select pretomanid-resistant mutants in two pathologically dis tinct murine TB models. The 
frequency of spontaneous pretomanid resistance mutations was ap proximately 10-5CFU.
Pretomanid demonstrated dose-dependent bactericidal activity and  selective amplification of 
resistant mutants. Whole genome sequencing of 161 resistant isolates from 47 mice revealed 99
unique mutations, 90% of which were found in 1 of 5 genes previo usly associated with 
nitroimidazole activation and resistance. The remaining 10% harbor ed isolated mutations in 
Rv2983 . Complementing an Rv2983 mutant with a wild-type copy of Rv2983 restored wild-type 
susceptibility to pretomanid and delamanid, confirming that loss of Rv2983 function causes
nitroimidazole resistance. By quantifying F 420and its precursor Fo in Mycobacterium smegmatis
overexpressing Rv2983 and an M. tuberculosis Rv2983 mutant, we provide evidence that Rv2983
is necessary for F 420 biosynthesis and nitroimidazole activation, perhaps as the 
guanylyltransferase CofC. F 420H2-deficient mutants displayed hypersusceptibility to malachite 
green (MG), a selective decontaminant present in solid media used to isolate and propagate 
mycobacteria from clinical samples. The wide diversity of mutatio ns causing high-level certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

 pretomanid resistance and MG hypersusceptibility of most mutants poses significant challenges
to clinical detection of nitroimidazole resistance using either gen otypic or phenotypic methods. 
INTRODUCTION
Despite decades of efforts to end the global tuberculosis (TB) e pidemic, Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis is the leading killer among infectious agents plaguing mankind ( 1). The emergence 
and spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-re sistant (XDR) M. tuberculosis
makes the eradication effort much more difficult because treatment  requires administration of 
more toxic and less effective second- and third-line drugs for u p to 2 years ( 1, 2). Delamanid and 
pretomanid are promising new bicyclic 4-nitroimidazole drugs that have shown potential in pre-
clinical and clinical studies to shorten and simplify the treatment of TB, including drug-resistant 
forms ( 3-9). Delamanid received conditional approval by the European Medic ines Agency (EMA) 
to treat MDR-TB in 2014 ( 10) and pretomanid is currently being evaluated in Phase 2/3 clinical  
trials ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT03338621, NCT02589782, NCT0233 3799,
NCT03086486 ). Particularly notable is a novel regimen comprised of bedaquili ne, pretomanid 
and linezolid that may represent a highly efficacious oral, shor t-course regimen for treatment of 
MDR/XDR-TB ( 4)(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT02333799, NCT03086486) .
Two non-exclusive mechanisms of action have been described for th ese bicyclic 4-nitroimidazole
drugs: inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis through inhibition of my colic acid synthesis and 
respiratory poisoning through release of nitric oxide during bac terial drug metabolism ( 11, 12 ).
Pretomanid and delamanid are prodrugs that require bioreductive activation of an aromatic nitro 
group by the 8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin (coenzyme F 420)-dependent nitroreductase Ddn in order to 
exert bactericidal activity ( 13). The reaction involves the transfer of two electrons from the reduced 
form of F 420(F420H2) produced by an F 420-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Fgd1)
(12, 14 ). Therefore, F 420biosynthesis and reduction are essential for the activation of de lamanid, 
pretomanid and other nitroimidazole prodrugs. Three genes are ide ntified as essential for F 420certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 biosynthesis in M. tuberculosis complex ( 15, 16 ).fbiC encodes a 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-
deazariboflavin (Fo) synthase that catalyzes the condensation of 5- amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4 (1 H,
3H)-pyrimidinedione and tyrosine to form the F 420precursor Fo ( 17, 18 ).fbiA encodes a
transferase that is believed to catalyze the transfer of a phospholactyl moiety to Fo to generate 
F420-0, while fbiBencodes a F 420-Ȗ-L-glutamyl ligase that catalyzes the sequential addition of a
variable number of glutamate residues to F 420-0 to yield coenzyme F 420-5 or -6 in mycobacteria 
(12). In the methanogen Methanocaldococcus jannaschii , a guanylyltransferase termed CofC is 
believed to generate an intermediate (L-lactyl-2-diphospho-5’-guanosine, LPPG) in the F 420
biosynthesis pathway ( 19). A homologous enzyme, MSMEG_2392, is shown to be necessary for 
F420synthesis in Mycobacterium smegmatis through transposon mutagenesis studies ( 20). An
ortholog, Rv2983 , is present in M. tuberculosis . However, the role of MSMEG-2392 and Rv2983 
in F 420biosynthesis has remained unexplored.
Loss-of-function mutations in ddn,fgd1 and fbiA-C causing delamanid and pretomanid resistance
are readily selected in vitro in M. tuberculosis complex ( 16, 18, 21-23 ). However, the genetic 
spectrum of mutations emerging during in vivo selection has not been characterized. In order to 
study bacterial genetic, host and pharmacological factors associ ated with emergence of 
nitroimidazole resistance in vivo , we selected pretomanid-resistant mutants using a wide range 
of pretomanid doses in two mouse models of TB and characterized them by whole genome 
sequencing (WGS). Because the lungs of TB patients feature a hete rogeneous array of lesion 
types associated with diversified immune responses and drug penet ration ( 24, 25 ), we used both 
C3HeB/FeJ mice, which develop caseating lung lesions in respons e to M. tuberculosis infection, 
and BALB/c mice, which do not, to investigate the impact of these  caseating lesions and their 
associated micro-environments on mutant selection. In the present study, we found that 
pretomanid-resistant mutants were readily selected by monotherap y in both mouse strains. While 
the majority of resistant isolates harbored isolated mutations in  genes previously associated with certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 nitroimidazole resistance, all the resistant isolates lacking such  mutations had mutations in 
Rv2983 . We went on to confirm that loss-of-function mutations in Rv2983 cause high-level 
pretomanid and delamanid resistance through disruption of F 420biosynthesis, supporting the 
hypothesis that Rv2983 plays a role similar to cofC in M. tuberculosis . Furthermore, F 420H2-
deficient nitroimidazole-resistant M. tuberculosis mutants, including Rv2983 mutants, were found 
to be hypersensitive to malachite green (MG), an organic compound used as a selective 
decontaminant in solid media for culturing M. tuberculosis , which may have important implications 
for their detection in clinical samples.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains, media, antimicrobials and reagents. Wild type M. tuberculosis H37Rv 
(ATCC 27294) was mouse-passaged, frozen in aliquots and used in  all the experiments. The wild 
type M. smegmatis strain mc2155 was obtained from the stock in the lab. Unless stated otherw ise, 
Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Difco, BD) supplemented with 10% oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-
catalase (OADC) complex (BD), 0.5% glycerol and 0.05% Tween 80 (Sigma-Aldrich) (7H9 broth)
was used for cultivation. Middlebrook 7H10 agar and selective 7H11  agar (Difco, BD), prepared 
from powder and containing 10% OADC and 0.5% glycerol, were used for comparison of strain
recovery on commercially available agar plates. Lowenstein Jensen  (LJ) slants were purchased
from BD. Pretomanid and delamanid were kindly provided by the Globa l Alliance for TB Drug 
Development (New York, NY).
Mouse infection models and pretomanid treatment. All animal procedures were approved by 
the Animal Care and Use Committee of Johns Hopkins University. A erosol infections were 
performed using the Inhalation Exposure System (Glas-col Inc., Terre Haute, IN), as previously 
described ( 26). Briefly, 6-week-old female BALB/c mice (Charles River, Wilming t o n ,  M A )  a n dcertified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 C3HeB/FeJ mice (Jackson Laboratories Bar Harbor, ME) were infec ted with a log phase culture 
of M. tuberculosis that was grown in 7H9 broth to O.D.600 nm= 1.0 and then diluted in the same 
medium prior to infection to deliver 50-100 CFU to the lungs. Pret omanid was formulated for oral 
administration as previously described ( 27). Beginning 8 weeks after aerosol infection, mice were 
randomly allocated into groups and treated once daily (5 days per  week) for up to 8 weeks with 
pretomanid at doses of 10, 30, 100, 300 and 1000 mg/kg. Untreated mice were sacrificed on the 
day after aerosol infection and on the day of treatment initiatio n to determine the number of CFU 
implanted in the lungs and pretreatment CFU counts, respectively . Additional mice were sacrificed 
after 3 and 8 weeks of treatment to evaluate the treatment respo nse. Serial 10-fold dilutions of 
lung homogenates were plated on 7H11 agar. Week 8 samples includi ng those from untreated 
mice were also plated in parallel on 7H11 plates containing 0.2 5, 1 and 10 μg/ml of pretomanid
to quantify the resistant CFU. Plates were incubated at 37°C for  28 days before final CFU counts 
were determined.
Whole genome sequencing. For each mouse lung that yielded growth on pretomanid-containing
plates, individual colonies and, for a subset of mice, pools of up to 15 colo nies, were randomly
selected from pretomanid-containing plates and sub-cultured in 7H9 brot h prior to extraction of
genomic DNA using the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) pro tocol ( 28) and vortexing
(Genegate, Inc.). 2- ȝJRI genomic DNA was sheared by a nebulizer to generate DNA fragment s. 
The DNA library was prepared using a genomic DNA sample prepara tion kit (Illumina, Inc.), in 
which adapter-ligated DNA fragments were 250-350 bp in length, a nd carried out on an Illumina 
Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc). The sequencer was operated i n paired-end mode to collect 
pairs of reads of 51-bp from opposite ends of each fragment. Ima ge analysis and base-calling 
were done by using the Illumina GA Pipeline software (v0.3). Th e reads that were generated for 
each strain were aligned to the reference genome of M. tuberculosis H37Rv ( 29). Based on 
alignment to the corresponding region in the reference genome, single nucleotide polymorphism certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

building algorithm to construct a local ~200 bp sequence spanni ng the site of mutagenesis ( 30).
Distribution of mutation type and mutation frequency in genes i nvolved in nitroimidazole
resistance was calculated by counting the total number of unique mutations isolated from each
mouse in the same treatment group.
Complementation of an Rv2983 mutation. A 1,044-bp DNA fragment containing the open 
reading frame (ORF) of the wild type Rv2983 gene, including 340 bp of 5’-flanking sequence and 
59 bp of 3’-flanking sequence, was PCR-amplified from M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA 
using primers Rv2983 -1F and Rv2983 -1R (Table S1). The Rv2983 PCR product was ligated into 
XbaI-digested E.coli-mycobacterium shuttle vector pMH94 ( 31) using NE builder HiFi DNA 
assembly kit (NE Biolabs) to generate the recombinant pMH94- Rv2983 vector. Similarly, a 388-
bp DNA fragment containing the hsp60 promoter and a 645-bp DNA fragment of Rv2983 open 
reading frame were amplified from M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA using primer sets hsp60 -
F and hsp60 -R and Rv2983 -2F and Rv2983 -2R, respectively (Table S1), and ligated into XbaI-
digested E.coli-mycobacterium shuttle vector pMH94 to yield pMH94- hsp60 -Rv2983 .A  s m a l l  
amount of ligation reaction was transferred into E. coli competent cells, followed by DNA 
sequencing of the inserts in the corresponding recombinants. The  recombinants pMH94- Rv2983 
and pMH94- hsp60 -Rv2983 were electroporated into competent cells of Rv2983 mutant strain
BA_101 (B101), harboring an A198P substitution, to enable selection of complemented

a digoxigenin (DIG) DNA labeling and detection kit according to t he manufacturer’s protocol 
(Sigma). Briefly, a 448-bp Rv2983 probe was generated by addition of DIG-dUTP (Sigma) to PCR 
reactions containing primer pairs Rv2983 -3F and Rv2983 -3R (Table S1). Acc65I-digested (NE

 Rv2983 complemented strains was separated on agarose gel and transferre d onto positively-
charged nylon-membrane (GE). After pre-hybridization, the membra ne was hybridized with the 
DIG-labeled Rv2983 probe at 68°C overnight, followed by addition of anti-DIG alkaline  
phosphatase conjugate. After stringent washes, the membrane was incubated wi th the

MIC determination. Log-phase cultures were diluted to achieve a bacterial density of  
approximately 105CFU/ml in conical tubes containing 7H9 broth without Tween 80. Ser ial 10-fold 
dilutions were plated on 7H11 agar containing stepwise 2-fold incre asing pretomanid
concentrations ranging from 0.015 to 64 μg/ml or delamanid concentra tions from 0.001 to 1.024
μg/ml. Drugs were initially dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO ) (Sigma) prior to further dilution 
in 7H9 broth or 7H11 agar. Cultures were incubated at 37°C for 14  days or 28 days after plating.
MIC was defined as the lowest drug concentration that inhibited visible M. tuberculosis growth in 
conical tubes or that inhibited 99% of CFU growth on pretomanid-c ontaining plates ( 33, 34 ). The 
experiments were repeated twice.

Measurement of Fo and F 420.Extraction of Fo and F 420was performed in M. smegmatis andM. 
tuberculosis strains according to a previous study ( 35), with minor modifications. Briefly, M. 
smegmatis strains harboring different constructs and pYUBDuet were grown i n 7H9 broth in a 
shaker to mid-log phase (O.D. 600nm = 0.7-1.0), followed by induction using 1mM i VRSURS\Oȕ -D-1-
thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 6 and 26 hours. After centrifugat ion for 15 min at 16000 x g, the 
supernatants were removed for detection of Fo, which is principally found in culture supernatant 
whereas F 420 with 5 or 6 glutamate residues is largely retained inside cells ( 15, 35, 36 ). The cell 
pellets were washed with 25mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) a nd re-suspended at 100
mg/mL in the same buffer, then autoclaved at 121°C for 15 min. Afte r centrifugation at 16000 x g
for 15 min at 4°C, the cell extracts were harvested for detection of F 420(35). Fluorescence of the 
supernatant and cell extracts was measured using an excitation wa velength of 410 nm and an 
emission wavelength of 465 nm. Fluorescent signals of Fo were nor malized using the O.D. at 
600nm. The small portion of Fo (1-7%) retained inside cells was ig nored when quantifying F 420in 
cell extracts ( 37). Relative fluorescent signals were calculated in M. smegmatis harboring each of 
recombinants relative to pYUBDuet alone. Similarly, cell extracts  and supernatant were extracted 
from M. tuberculosis strains grown in 7H9 broth for 6 days at initial O.D. 600nm of 0.1. Relative 
fluorescent signals of F 420 and Fo were calculated using cell extracts and supernatant relat ive to 
25 mM phosphate buffer and 7H9 broth, respectively. M. smegmatis harboring pYUBDuet- fbiABC certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

 was used as a positive signal control for Fo and F 420due to their commercial unavailability ( 35).
The experiment was repeated twice.
Quantification of gene expression in M. tuberculosis .6-day-old M. tuberculosis strains grown 
in 7H9 broth as described above were sub-cultured in fresh 7H9 at  O.D. 600nm = 0.05 followed by 
incubation at 37 °C in a shaker for 2 and 4 days. Bacterial pellets were collected by centrifugation 
at 3500 rpm at 4°C for purification of total RNA using Trizol ( Thermo Fisher Scientific) according 
to the manufacturer’s protocol followed by removal of DNA conta mination with Turbo DNAse 
(Ambion). Following cDNA synthesis with random hexamers and olig o(dT)20 primer and 
superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), quantitativ e PCR was performed to measure
gene expression of M. tuberculosis using  SYBR Green PCR master mix (Thermo scientific) and 
StepOneTM system (Applied biosystems) with primer sets listed in Table S1. T he cycle threshold 
value (C T) measured for each gene was normalized to that of the housekeep ing gene sigA ¨& T)
amplified by the primers sigA-F and sigA-R (Table S1). ¨¨& Twas calculated in each of 
pretomanid-resistant strains relative to the wild-type H37Rv prior to calculation of the fold-change 
in gene expression (2^- ¨¨& T)(38). All samples were prepared in duplicate. PCR was performed 
from an equal amount of cDNA samples synthesized with oligo(dT)2 0 with primers fbiC-5-7_F
andfbiC-5-7_R (Table S1) using the Q 5High-fidelity PCR kit (New England Biolabs) and C1000 
Thermal cycler (Biorad). The PCR product was examined by electro phoresis on a 1% agarose 
gel.
Malachite green susceptibility testing. 7H9 media supplemented with 10% OADC, 0.5% 
glycerol, 1.5% BactoTM Agar (BD) and malachite green (MG) oxalate (Alfa Aesar) was used to 
prepare solid 7H9 media with differing MG concentrations. M. tuberculosis strains were grown to 
mid-log phase and diluted to OD 600nm = 0.1 in 7H9 broth before serial 10-fold dilutions were plated 
in 100 or 500 μl aliquots on 7H9 agar containing MG concentration s of 0, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 100, 300, 1000 μg/ml or 0, 3, 6, 12 μg/ml. CFU were counted after 28, 35 and 49 days of 
incubation. The same cultures were also plated on 7H10 and 7H11 agar plates and LJ slants.
Serially diluted cultures were inoculated onto LJ slants using cal ibrated disposable inoculating 
loops (10 μl per loop, BD) as one l oop per LJ slant. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 21, 28 and 
35 days for CFU counts. Colony size was observed weekly until day 35, beginning 21 days after 
plating. The experiment was repeated two times under similar condi tions.
Statistical analysis. Log 10-transformed CFU counts, fold-change values of gene expression and  
absorbance (A 410) values of fluorescent signals were used to calculate means and standard 
deviations for each data set. Differences between means were compared by the Student’s ttest
in Microsoft Excel. Differences in mutation frequencies between t wo mouse models were 
evaluated by Fisher’s exact test in GraphPad Prism 6. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered 
statistically significant.
RESULTS
Spontaneous pretomanid-resistant mutants exist at a relatively h igh frequency in 
infected mice and are selectively amplified by treatment with ac tive doses of pretomanid.
To study the dose-response of pretomanid and explore the genetic s pectrum of nitroimidazole 
resistance selected in vivo , we established chronic M. tuberculosis infections in BALB/c and 
C3HeB/FeJ mice and then treated with a range of pretomanid doses f or up to 8 weeks. Despite 
lower CFU counts on the day after infection (W-8) in C3HeB/FeJ mice  (1.67 log 10CFU per lung) 
compared to BALB/c (2.26 log 10) (p<0.001), higher CFU counts were observed in C3HeB/FeJ 
mice 8 weeks later on the day treatment started (D0) and after 3 weeks of treatment in almost all 
groups ( p<0.001 - 0.05) (Fig. 1A). Three C3HeB/FeJ mice treated with 1000 mg /kg required 
euthanasia during the second week of treatment, prompting a dose  reduction from 1000 mg/kg to 
600 mg/kg in both strains. Nevertheless, a clear pretomanid dose -response relationship was certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

pretomanid-resistant CFU increased with dose up to the 300 mg/k g dose group. Dose-dependent

amplification of pretomanid-resistant mutants was more extensive and occurred at lower doses 
than in BALB/c mice (Fig. 1B and 1C). We were not able to measure  the spontaneous frequency 
of resistant mutants in untreated C3HeB/FeJ mice because they su ccumbed to infection prior to 
week 8. Pretomanid-resistant CFU replaced susceptible CFU in C3 HeB/FeJ mice receiving doses 
as low as 30 mg/kg and pretomanid-resistant CFU counts were rou ghly 10 times higher in 
C3HeB/FeJ mice compared to BALB/c mice (Fig. 1B and C), which in dicates greater potential for 
selective amplification of pretomanid resistance with monothera py in this strain. Most resistant 
isolates grew on plates containing 10 μg/ml of pretomanid, but some had fewer CFU on plates 
containing 10 μg/ml than on those containing 1 μg/ml of pretoman id.
Whole genome sequencing of pretomanid-resistant mutants revealed  diverse mutations in 
Rv2983 or in one of five other genes required for pretomanid activation.
To characterize mutations associated with pretomanid resistance in vivo , we performed WGS on 
136 individual pretomanid-resistant colonies and 25 colony pools picked from 47 individual mice
harboring pretomanid-resistant CFU after 8 weeks of treatment (Ta ble S2 and S3). Each 
individual isolate had an isolated mutation in Rv2983 or one of the 5 genes previously shown to certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 be required for pretomanid activation. Overall, 99 unique mutati ons in these 6 genes were 
identified from individual and pooled isolates (Table 1 and 2). E xcept for mutations K9N ( fgd1), 
R322L ( fbiC) and Q120P ( fbiA), which were shared by two mice each, no two mice harbored the 
same mutation, which emphasizes the large target size for resist ance-conferring mutations. In
both BALB/c and C3HeB/FeJ mice, more than half of the resistant isolates were fbiCmutants (54 
and 56%, respectively) (Table 3). For the other five genes, the ran k order by mutation frequency 
was Rv2983 (15%) > fbiA(13%) > ddn(9%) > fbiB(6%) > fgd1 (4%) in BALB/c mice and fbiA
(18%) > ddn (16%) > fgd1 orRv2983 (4%) > fbiB (2%) in C3HeB/FeJ mice. No significant 
differences in mutation frequencies between BALB/c and C3HeB/FeJ m ice were observed, 
although a trend towards more Rv2983 mutations in BALB/c mice (8/54, 15% of all mutations)
compared to C3HeB/FeJ mice (2/45, 4%) was detected. The mutations i dentified in Rv2983
included 8 point mutations resulting in the following amino acid  substitutions: R25S, R25G, A68E,
A132V, G147C, C152R, Q114R and A198P , as well as an insertion of C  after A27 and a deletion 
of I129 (-ATC) (Tables 1 and 2). The overall frequency distribution of unique mutations was as 
follows: fbiC (55%, n= 54), fbiA(15%, n = 15), ddn (12%, n = 12), Rv2983 (10%, n=10), fgd1 (4%, 
n= 4), and fbiB (4%, n=4) (Fig. 2 and Table S4). There were no clear associations  between 
pretomanid dose and the mutated gene. Mutations in fbiCcomprised a higher proportion of those 
selected in our in vivo study compared to the proportion selected in a previous in vitro study (26%, 
p= 0.0001)( 22). On the other hand, mutations in ddn(29%) were more frequent after in vitro
selection than in our mouse models (12%) ( p=0.001). In vitro mutation frequencies for fbiA,fgd1
andfbiB(19%, 7% and 2%, respectively) were similar to our findings in m ice.
Among the 99 unique mutations, all but one (an IS6110 insertion loc ated in 85-bp upstream of 
the fbiCcoding sequence in isolate KA-026a (Table 2 and Table S2) were found within the coding 
regions of the six genes. In total, 54% (53/99) were non-synonymou s point mutations (no 
synonymous point mutations were identified), 35% (35/99) were insertions or deletions (indels),certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 and 11% (11/99) were substitutions resulting in a stop codon. No sig nificant difference in the
distribution of point mutation and indels was found between our s and the in vitro study by Haver, 
et al, in which non-synonymous point mutations and indels were 50% (7 5/151) and 24% (36/151),
respectively. However, the frequency of stop codon substitutions in the latter study (26%, 40/151) 
was higher than that observed in the present study (11%, 11/99) ( p= 0.004), 85% (34/40) of which 
were in ddnin the latter study ( 22). Non-synonymous point mutations predominated relative to 
indels and stop codon mutations overall and in each gene except  for ddn(Fig. 2 and Table S4). 
The frequency of point mutations was similar between BALB/c and C 3HeB/FeJ mice (56% versus 
51%) (Table 3). A higher frequency of indels occurred in C3HeB/FeJ compared to BALB/c mice 
(44% versus 28%), while more stop codon mutations occurred in BALB/ c, but these differences 
were not statistically significant. There was no clear associati on between dose of pretomanid and 
the type of mutation selected.
Comparing the 99 unique mutations identified in our study with th e 151 unique mutations in 5 of 
the same genes selected in vitro (22), only 4 mutations were found in the same position. Only
W79 stop ( fbiA) and N336K ( fbiC) mutations were found in both datasets while both T273 and 
H190 ( fbiC) were mutated in the same position but with different mutations. As expected from the 
fact that most mutants could be isolated on plates containing 1 0 μg/ml of pretomanid, MICs 
determined against a small subset of isolates indicated high-level pretomanid resistance (Table 
S5 and Table 1 and 2). Taken together, these data illustrate the tremendous diversity of mutations
capable of conferring high-level pretomanid resistance.
Mutations in Rv2983 cause resistance to pretomanid and delamanid.
To prove that mutations in Rv2983 are sufficient for nitroimidazole resistance, merodiploid 
complemented strains were constructed by introducing a copy of t he wild type Rv2983 gene into 
B101, an Rv2983 mutant (A198P), through site-specific integration ( 31, 32 ). Following certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

 confirmation of successful integration by Southern blot using a DIG-labeled Rv2983 probe (Figs.
S1A and S1B), susceptibility testing by 7H9 broth dilution confirmed  significantly higher 
nitroimidazole MICs against the Rv2983 mutant (pretomanid and delamanid MICs of 32 μg/ml 
and 0.064-0.128 μg/ml, respectively) and full restoration of susceptibility in the complemented 
strains (pretomanid and delamanid MICs of 0.25 μg/ml and 0.008 μg/m l, respectively).
Rv2983 is required for F 420biosynthesis.
To demonstrate that Rv2983 is required for F 420biosynthesis, we measured the production of Fo
and F 420inM. smegmatis strains overexpressing Rv2983 and in M. tuberculosis Rv2983 mutant
strains compared with their corresponding control strains. Rv2983 andfbiC were successfully 
cloned into pYUBDuet and p fbiC(designated p Rv2983 and pfbiC -Rv2983 , respectively), followed 
by successful transformation of M. smegmatis , along with pYUBDuet and p fbiABC , which were 
confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion, DNA sequencing and P CR amplification (data not 
shown). Overexpression of Rv2983 in M. smegmatis increased F 420production but resulted in 
little change in Fo production compared to the control strain after 6 and 26 hours of induction with 
IPTG (Figs. 3A and 3B). As expected, mutation of Rv2983 in the M. tuberculosis B101 mutant 
markedly reduced F 420production, resulting in accumulation of Fo. Complementation ful ly 
restored the wild-type phenotype (Figs. 3C and 3D). In order to evaluate the method, we also 
overexpressed fbiC, which encodes the Fo synthase, with and without concomitant 
overexpression of Rv2983 in M. smegmatis . As expected, overexpression of fbiC increased Fo 
and, consequently, F 420concentrations. Relative to the control strain, F 420concentrations were
similar when either fbiC orRv2983 was over-expressed alone (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, when 
Rv2983 was co-overexpressed with fbiC, a dramatic increase in F 420was observed relative to 
over-expression of either gene alone (3.4 and 3.1-fold, respectiv ely) after 6 hours of IPTG 
induction ( p<0.001), with corresponding significant decreases of Fo levels afte r 6 and 26 hours of 
IPTG induction (5.8 and 3.1-fold; p<0.005 and 0.05, respectively) (Fig. 3A and 3B). These resultscertified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 suggest that the excess Fo produced by fbiC over-expression was efficiently converted to F 420by 
over-expressed Rv2983. On the other hand, although a small amount of F 420 was observed in cell 
extracts of two Rv2983 point mutants (B101 [A198P] and KA016 [Q114R]), their F 420content was
significantly lower than that of the wild type (7.3 and 7.7-fold )(p< 0.001) and complemented B101 
mutant (Fig. 3C). As expected, Fo accumulated in the two Rv2983 mutant strains relative the wild-
type (6.7 and 6.5-fold; p<0.05 and 0.005, respectively) (Fig. 3D), indicating that Fo was not 
efficiently converted to F 420 in the presence of a mutated Rv2983 . Two other pretomanid-resistant 
strains were also assessed as controls. The KA026 mutant with an IS6110 insertion 85 bp 
upstream of fbiChad undetectable Fo and very little F 420content, while the KA91 mutant with an
IS6110 insertion at amino acid position 108 of Ddn showed a wild-type phenotype with respect to
F420 and Fo concentrations (Fig.3C and D). 
To understand the effect of mutations on gene expression and it s regulation, we performed RT-
qPCR after sub-culturing the M. tuberculosis strains in fresh 7H9 broth. Expression of Rv2983
andfbiCincreased 2.4- and 1.6-fold, respectively, in the Rv2983 mutant B101 relative to the wild-
type H37Rv parent after 4 days of incubation in 7H9 broth. Simila r increases were observed in
other genes such as fbiA (2.3-fold), fbiB(2.0-fold) and fgd1 (2.2-fold) involved in F 420biosynthesis, 
suggesting that the reduced F 420content caused by the Rv2983 A198P mutation resulted in 
upregulation of the F 420biosynthesis pathway (Fig. S2A). Expression of fbiC in the KA026 mutant  
decreased 114-fold compared to that in the wild-type H37Rv parent after 2 days of incubation in 
7H9 broth, likely resulting from interrupted fbiCtranscription as a result of the insertion IS6110 at 
85-bp upstream and explaining the low levels of both Fo and F 420in that mutant (Fig. S2 B). A
faint band representing the fbiC DNA fragment of 937-bp from the fbiCKA026 mutant relative to 
H37Rv further supports this conclusion (Fig. S2C).

 Previous work using M. smegmatis showed that mutations in MSMEG_5126 (homolog of fbiC)
and MSMEG_2392 (which shares 69% homology with Rv2983 ) reduce the ability to decolorize
and detoxify MG, indicating that F 420is necessary for this process ( 20). To evaluate the role of 
each gene associated with nitroimidazole activation in the susce ptibility to MG, log-phase cultures 
of 10 selected mutants were plated on 7H9 agar supplemented with a range of MG
concentrations. All mutants deficient in F 420synthesis or reduction ( i.e., those with mutations in 
fbiA-C ,Rv2983 or fgd1) were more susceptible to MG, while the ddnmutant retained the same 
susceptibility as the wild type H37Rv parent, whose growth was al most completely inhibited at
0*FRQFHQWUDWLRQVJPO (Fig. 4A). The lability of F 420H2and lack of a commercial source for 
F420made it unfeasible to attempt to test whether provision of F 420H2could rescue the MG-
hypersusceptible phenotype of the F 420H2-deficient mutants. To confirm that Rv2983 is necessary 
for the intrinsic resistance of M. tuberculosis to MG, we compared the growth of the B101 mutant 
to that of the wild type and complemented strains on MG. Again, grow th of this Rv2983 mutant 
was inhibited by lower concentrations of MG than the wild type st rain and required longer 
incubation times before colonies appeared on MG-containing plates (Fig. 4B-D). Plating at higher 
bacterial density (500 μl rather than 100 μl of cell suspension per plate) significantly increased
recovery (Fig. S3A and B). Complementation of Rv2983 fully restored the wild-type growth 
phenotype on MG concentrations up to 6 μg/ml. Interestingly, at MG  concentrations above 6 
μg/ml, greater recovery was observed when Rv2983 was expressed behind the native promoter 
compared to the hsp60 promoter (Fig. 4B-D). Smaller colony size was observed in the Rv2983
mutant relative to the wild type and the complemented strains on plates without MG after 21 days 
of incubation but not after 28 days of incubation (Fig. 5). Howeve r, smaller colony size and 
deficient decolorization was observed for the Rv2983 mutant on plates containing MG
concentrations as low as 0.25 and 1 μg/ml, even after 28 days of incubation (Fig. 5). At MG
concentrations of 6-12 μg/ml, even more-concentrated aliquots of  the B101 mutant culture 
showed markedly reduced recovery despite 42 days of incubation (Fi g. 5).certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

 Because all solid media commonly used to isolate and cultivate M. tuberculosis in clinical 
laboratories contain MG as a selective decontaminant, the increa sed MG susceptibility conferred 
by mutations in fbiA-C,Rv2983 and fgd1 could compromise the isolation and propagation (and 
hence identification) of nitroimidazole-resistant mutants from c linical samples. Commercial 7H10
agar, 7H11 agar and LJ medium contain 0.25, 1 and 400 μg/ml, res pectively, of MG. To assess 
the potential impact of these media on the isolation of an F 420H2-deficient nitroimidazole-resistant
Rv2983 mutant relative to an F 420H2-sufficient, but still nitroimidazole-resistant, ddn mutant and 
the nitroimidazole-susceptible wild type and Rv2983- complemented mutant, we inoculated these 
media in parallel using serial dilutions of each strain. The Rv2983 mutant exhibited 10 times lower 
CFU counts and smaller colony size relative to other strains af ter 21 and 28 days of incubation 
on 7H10 agar plates ( p<0.01) (Figs. 6A and C(a)). The result after 35 days of incubat ion was
generally similar between the mutant and the control strains (F ig. 6A and C(b)). A similar semi-
quantitative growth assessment of the Rv2983 mutant on LJ media compared to other strains 
including a ddnmutant (K91, IS6110 ins in D108) revealed growth inhibition of t he Rv2983 mutant 
that was ameliorated by increasing the size of the bacterial in oculum from 102to 106CFU/ml and 
increasing the incubation time from 28 to 35 days (Fig. 6D). In terestingly, no difference in growth 
was found on 7H11 agar (Fig. 6B), even when comparing colony si ze after just 21 days of 
incubation (Fig. 6C(c)), despite higher MG concentrations in th at medium compared to 7H10. 
Unlike 7H10, 7H11 medium contains hydrolysate of casein, which may somehow mitigate against 
the MG toxicity. Taken together, these results indicate that use  of 7H10 and LJ could compromise
the recovery and propagation of F 420H2-deficient nitroimidazole-resistant mutants from clinical 
specimens and that 7H11 agar may be the preferred solid media for processing specimens
propagating any isolates from nitroimidazole-treated patients.certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

 DISCUSSION
As representatives of one of only two new drug classes approved for use against TB in roughly 
50 years, delamanid and pretomani d are important and promising n ew drugs ( 3, 4, 6, 7, 39 ). The 
former received accelerated approval from the EMA for treatment  of MDR-TB and is now used 
clinically, albeit sparingly, while a phase 3 trial is being co mpleted. The latter is being evaluated 
in clinical trials as a component of highly promising regimens for both drug-susceptible and 
MDR/XDR-TB. Comprehensive knowledge of genetic mutations conferring nitroimidazole 
resistance in M. tuberculosis and the resultant mutant phenotypes are critical for timely and 
accurate diagnosis of resistance and, therefore, the safe and effective use of these drugs in the 
clinical setting. Previous work identified 5 genes ( fbiA-C ,fgd1, and ddn) involved in the activation 
pathway of nitroimidazole prodrugs in which mutations may confe r drug resistance in M. 
tuberculosis complex ( 16, 18, 21-23, 40 ). In a prior study of the spectrum of nitroimidazole 
resistance-conferring mutations, Haver, et al found that 151 (83%) of 183 pretomanid-
resistant isolates selected in vitro harbored a single mutation in one of these 5 genes ( 22).
However, 17% of the selected strains harbored no mutations in t hese genes. The present study 
has several important new findings. First, we identified a novel nitroimidazole resistance 
determinant—mutations in Rv2983 —that explained, in the case of our study, all of the pretomanid 
resistance that was not attributable to mutations in the 5 prev iously described genes. Second, we 
demonstrate for the first time that Rv2983 is required for F 420biosynthesis and likely plays a role 
similar to cofC in the methanogen M. jannaschii (19). Third, we show that Rv2983 and the ability 
to produce F 420H2are essential for full tolerance of M. tuberculosis to the selective decontaminant 
MG, which raises serious concerns about the ability to reliably recover most nitroimidazole-
resistant mutants from clinical samples on the most widely used microbiology media.
Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the spec trum of nitroimidazole-resistant 
mutants selected in vivo and, because we used WGS, it represents the most comprehensive certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

 analysis made to-date. Despite the insignificant differences in m utation frequencies between the 
two mouse strains for other genes related to nitroimidazole acti vation, Rv2983 mutations were 
observed with a somewhat higher frequency in BALB/c mice, indica ting a possible host-specific 
fitness cost that warrants further dedicated study. Like the in vitro study by Haver et al (22), we 
found that isolated mutations in fbiA-C ,fgd1, orddnexplained the majority of the pretomanid-
resistant isolates we selected. However, whereas their study le ft 17% of resistant isolates 
unexplained, we found that all of the remaining resistant isolate s, representing 10% of the total 
number of unique mutations, harbored mutations in Rv2983 , a gene not previously implicated in 
nitroimidazole resistance. Indeed, the proportion of resistant isolates explained by Rv2983 (10%) 
was similar to the proportion explained by fbiA (15%) and ddn(12%) mutations, which lagged 
only mutations in fbiC (55%) as the predominant cause of pretomanid resistance in our m ice.
Although the Rv2983 A198T mutation caused a smaller upward shift in the delamanid M IC 
compared to the pretomanid MIC, the delamanid MIC of 0.064-0.12 8 μg/ml against the mutant 
was still significantly higher than the recently proposed criti cal concentration of 0.016 μg/ml ( 41).
Thus, the identification of Rv2983 mutations should be included in rapid molecular drug 
susceptibility tests and algorithms for the diagnosis of nitroim idazole resistance from genome 
sequence data. The 10 mutations in Rv2983 identified in this study (Table 1 and 2) represent the 
first step in the process of identifying specific resistance-co nferring mutations to inform test 
development.
Rv2983 has 22% amino acid sequence identity to CofC (MJ0887) of M. jannaschii , a putative 
guanylyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of coenzyme F 420from the precursor Fo. CofC is 
believed to catalyze the condensation of 2-phospho-L-lactate (LP )  a n d  G T P  t o  f o r m  l a c t y l - 2 -
diphospho-5’-guanosine (LPPG) and PP i(19). Subsequent condensation of LPPG with Fo
catalyzed by CofD (FbiA) forms F 420–0 and is followed by sequential addition of glutamate
residues by CofE (FbiB) to produce F 420with a poly-glutamate tail ( 19). Up to now, a CofC homolog certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 has not been identified in M. tuberculosis . It is known that Fo biosynthesis is catalyzed by FbiC,
but it is not clear how Fo is modified by FbiA to form F 420–0. Bashiri, et al tried to understand the 
mechanism by overexpressing fbiC in the saprophyte M. smegmatis , which did not dramatically 
increase F 420biosynthesis, suggesting that an additional intermediate is req uired to form F 420–0
from Fo ( 35). Using overexpression of Rv2983 in M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis Rv2983 
mutants, we provide initial evidence that Rv2983 catalyzes an important step required for 
synthesis of F 420from Fo in the pathogen M. tuberculosis , which adds to previous evidence that
its ortholog MSMEG_2392 is involved in F 420biosynthesis in M. smegmatis (20). The validity of 
the method used in this study for detection of F 420and Fo was demonstrated by showing the 
expected results with two pretomanid-resistant strains, KA016 and KA026, harboring mutations 
infbiC andddn, respectively. Although the role of Rv2983 remains to be confirmed, our results 
confirm that expression of Rv2983 is necessary for efficient conversion of Fo to F 420(Fig. 3G).
Our results confirm and significantly extend prior in vitro work demonstrating the remarkable 
diversity of mutations capable of conferring high-level nitroim idazole resistance. Among the 99
unique mutations we identified in 47 mice, only 3 mutations (K9N in  fgd1, R322L in fbiC and
Q120P in fbiA) were found in more than one mouse. Furthermore, by comparing t he 99 unique 
mutations observed in our mice with the 151 unique mutations sele cted in vitro (22), the same 
mutation occurred only twice. Thus, each of the 6 genes now impli cated in nitroimidazole 
resistance appears to be devoid of “hot spots” for such mutations.  The frequency of spontaneous
mutations conferring nitroimidazole resistance in M. tuberculosis has been investigated in vitro by 
several studies and found to range from 1 in 105to 7 in 107CFU ( 21-23, 27, 40, 42 ), which is 
consistent with our findings in the lungs of untreated BALB/c mi ce. The large “target size” for 
mutations in 6 non-essential genes drives these high frequencies o f spontaneous nitroimidazole-
resistant mutants in M. tuberculosis populations, which is as high or higher than that for isoniazid 
and other TB drugs in clinical use. Our unpublished observations s uggest that similar frequencies certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 of nitroimidazole-resistant mutants exist in sputum isolates co llected from treatment-naïve, drug-
susceptible TB patients. Delamanid-resistant M. tuberculosis has been recovered from patients 
both before and after delamanid treatment ( 10, 43-45 ). To date, emergence of resistance has not 
been described during use of pretomanid in clinical trials, but s uch use has been restricted to 
relatively short treatment durations and/or use of highly activ e companion drugs. Pretomanid 
resistance has emerged during combination therapy in mouse model s(3, 46 ). Thus, the relatively 
high frequency of spontaneous mutations conferring nitroimidazole resistance and available pre-
clinical and clinical data underscore the importance of making validated drug susceptibility testing 
for this class widely available as clinical usage expands. The u nprecedented number and diversity 
of resistance-conferring mutations demonstrated for nitroimidaz ole drugs here and by Haver et al
(22), clearly challenges the development and interpretation of rapi d molecular susceptibility tests,
especially considering that polymorphisms in nitroimidazole res istance genes that represent 
phylogenetic markers but do not confer pretomanid resistance are w ell-described ( 47, 48 ). A
similar situation exists for pncA mutations and pyrazinamide (PZA) resistance, where an efficient, 
yet comprehensive method based on saturating mutagenesis for dis tinguishing single nucleotide 
polymorphisms conferring resistance was recently described ( 49). A similar analysis of 
substitutions in the 6 genes related to nitroimidazole resistance would similarly advance the 
development of drug susceptibility testing using genome sequencin g technology. 
Amino acid substitutions in the PZA-activating PncA protein tha t confer PZA resistance are 
associated with diminished enzymatic activity or reduced abundan ce of the protein (49 ). Similar 
mechanisms could explain the overall mechanisms of the 99 mutatio ns we identified in the six 
genes conferring nitroimidazole resistance. The Rv2983 A198P or Q114R substitutions may 
change the conformation of Rv2983 protein structure and reduce its enzymatic activity given that 
it has no effect on Rv2983 gene transcription. F 420biosynthesis is dramatically decreased while 
expression of Rv2983 and other genes increases, perhaps indicating an unknown regulator y certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

will provide useful information for future studies on structure -function associations of the potential 
M. tuberculosis CofC homolog. The KA026 mutant harboring an IS6110 insertion 85 b p upstream 
offbiC exhibited significantly decreased expression of fbiC, possibly due to interruption of the 
promoter region, and, consequently, almost complete loss of Fo syn thase activity. Hence, the 
upstream regulatory regions of the six genes also should be con sidered in future identification of 
resistance-conferring mutations, although their prevalence in th is study was only 1%.
Our findings regarding the heightened susceptibility of F 420H2-deficient mutants to MG pose a 
previously unappreciated challenge to the development and use o f phenotypic testing methods. 
Indeed, we observed reduced or delayed recovery of a nitroimidaz ole-resistant Rv2983 mutant 
on commercial 7H10 and LJ media that include MG as a selective decontaminant ( 50). Since fbiA-
Candfgd1 mutants, as well as a second Rv2983 mutant, exhibited similar hypersusceptibility to 
MG in 7H9 agar supplemented with MG, their recovery on 7H10 and L J is also likely to be affected.
Selective growth inhibition of nitroimidazole-resistant strains  on media that are commonly used in 
clinical microbiology laboratories around the world raises seri ous concern that their recovery from 
clinical specimens may be impaired to such an extent that it reduc es the sensitivity and accuracy 
of phenotypic drug susceptibility testing, especially for isola tes comprised of mixed wild-type and 
resistant populations. This concern is further amplified by the common practice of performing 
susceptibility testing (including molecular testing), not on pr imary samples but, on isolates that 
have been sub-cultured one or more times on solid media. Such p ractices may drastically reduce 
the proportion of (or eradicate) F 420H2-deficient mutants present in the original sample. In addition, 
efforts to develop MG decolorization assays for detection of dr ug-resistant TB are expected to be 
fruitless for these mutants ( 51-54 ). We did not determine the basis for the greater recovery of 
F420H2-deficient mutants on 7H11 vs. 7H10 media despite 4x higher tot al MG concentrations in 
the former. The principal differences between these media are t he presence of pancreatic digest certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 of casein in 7H11 and lower concentrations of magnesium sulfate countered by the addition of 
copper sulfate, zinc sulfate and calcium chloride in 7H10. Alth ough this issue clearly requires 
further study, we presently believe that 7H10 and LJ should not be employed for phenotypic 
nitroimidazole susceptibility testing and that primary isolation  or subculture of any isolate on such 
media prior to either phenotypic or genotypic susceptibility te sting should be avoided whenever 
possible. When it cannot be avoided, larger inoculum sizes and l onger incubation times may 
increase recovery on 7H10 and LJ. Based on our study, 7H11 agar  appears to be the preferred 
solid medium for recovery of F 420H2-deficient nitroimidazole-resistant M. tuberculosis .
A role for cofactor F 420H2in tolerance of was previously demonstrated ( 20). Whereas 
mycobacteria are normally capable of decolorizing and detoxifyi ng MG, mutations in the 
saprophyte M. smegmatis orthologs of fgd1,fbiC andRv2983 disrupt this ability and/or reduce 
the MIC of MG ( 20, 55 ). We now extend these observations to the pathogen M. tuberculosis and 
also implicate fbiA andfbiB, but not ddn, in MG tolerance. In Citrobacter species, an NADH-
dependent triphenylmethane reductase catalyzes reduction of MG to colorless leucoMG that lacks 
antimicrobial activity and is sequestered in the lipid fraction  of the cells ( 56, 57 ). Triphenylmethane 
reductase has not been identified in mycobacteria. However, the enhanced MG susceptibility of 
the F 420H2-deficient mutants, but not ddnmutants, suggests that one or more analogous, yet 
unidentified, F 420H2-dependent reductases is responsible for decolorizing and detox ifying MG in 
mycobacteria. 
Prior studies indicated other fitness costs associated with F 420H2deficiency, such as 
hypersusceptibility to oxidative and nitrosative stresses ( 12, 58, 59 ). Nevertheless, we observed 
selective amplification of F 420H2-deficient mutants in mice over a range of pretomanid doses tha t 
included doses producing much higher drug exposures than those p roduced in patients. 
Amplification was especially pronounced at higher drug doses, w hich eliminated the majority of 
nitroimidazole-susceptible population more effectively, and in C3HeB/FeJ mice. The lack of certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

 marked in vivo fitness defects is also supported by the fact that the proportio n of all unique 
resistance mutations explained by each mutation did not differ much between the in vitro and in 
vivo conditions, except that a higher proportion of fbiCmutations predominated in mice, somewhat 
at the expense of ddnmutations ( 22). Likewise, indels and stop codon mutations comprised nearly 
50% of the mutations responsible for resistance. This proportion  may be biased due to the high 
drug doses tested in some mice because such mutations are more likely to result in complete 
loss-of-function and therefore more complete resistance. However , the frequency of such 
mutations did not appear to change in a dose-dependent manner. I nterestingly, most Rv2983 
mutants were selected in BALB/c rather than C3HeB/FeJ mice despi te similar mutation rates in 
other genes between the two mouse strains. Whether this represe nts a real or a random 
difference will require further study. Clearly, clinicians must  rely on effective combination drug 
therapy to prevent the selective amplification of nitroimidazol e-resistant mutants. Heightened 
susceptibility to agents causing oxidative stress has been demo nstrated for F 420H2-deficient M. 
tuberculosis and M. smegmatis mutants ( 58). A more complete understanding of the unique 
vulnerabilities of such mutants should aid in the design of effec tive combination regimens that 
also optimally restrict selection of nitroimidazole-resistant mut ants.
In conclusion, using BALB/c and C3HeB/FeJ mice and WGS, we character ized the pretomanid 
dose-response relationships for bactericidal effect and suppres sion of drug-resistant mutants and 
profiled the genetic spectrum of pretomanid resistance emerging in vivo . A novel resistance 
determinant, Rv2983, was identified as essential for F 420biosynthesis and activation of the novel 
TB pro-drugs delamanid and pretomanid. Furthermore, we provide e vidence that F 420H2-deficient,
nitroimidazole-resistant M. tuberculosis mutants are hypersensitive to MG, raising concern that
using MG-containing medium coul d compromise the isolation and p ropagation of M. tuberculosis
from clinical samples and therefore hinder the clinical diagnos is of nitroimidazole resistance.

was performed with 136 pretomanid-resistant colonies and 25 colon y pools picked from 47 
individual mice harboring pretomanid-resistant CFU after 8 week s of treatment and identified 99
unique mutations in these 6 genes. Mutations in fbiC (55%) were the predominant cause of
