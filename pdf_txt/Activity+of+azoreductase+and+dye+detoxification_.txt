 Abstract 18  
Azo dye decolorizing acclimatized decolorizing consortia are enriched microbial sources 19  
of potential azoreductase-efficient bioremediation strains. Here, we characterized eight 20  
selected consortial members for their azo decolorization and azoreductase profiling. These 21  
efficient dye decolorizing bacterial isolates were affiliated to two major phyla viz. 22  
Firmicute  (genus- Enterococcus ) and Proteobacteria ( γ-group) . Redox-mediators such as 23  
AQDS and AQS were found to significantly increase decolorization except for menadione, 24  
and IR functional group signatures highlighted the azo bond reduction and degraded 25  
metabolites profiles of each strain. Among isolates, Enterococcus sp. L2 was found to be 26  
the most effective strain as it could reduce >90mg/L Reactive violet 5R (RV5R) dye in 3h 27  
of incubation. Furthermore, strain L2 possesses profound high NADH and NADPH- 28  
dependent azoreductase activity which also corroborated with its superior azo 29  
decolorization. As per physicochemical parameters, strain L2 showed an optimum 30  
decolorization at pH 8, 40 °C and up to 2% w/v salinity. To channelize reducing 31  
equivalence (NADH) to further enhance the dye decolorization in NADH-azoreductase 32  
efficient Enterococcus  sp. L2, we augmented an NADH co-factor regeneration system. 33  
Using pMGS100, a Gram-positive expression vector a constitutive heterologous expression 34  
of Mycobacterium  vaccae encoded NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase enhanced 35  
NADH pool which led to a significant 3.2 fold increased dye decolorization in 36  
Enterococcus  sp. L2 harboring pMGS100 fdh along  with a positive effect on growth. 37  
Ultimately, an augmentation of formate utilization step could further accelerate azo dye 38  
decolorization by fulfilling the co-factor (NADH) requirement of azoreductase along with 39  
a growth advantage in the non-model azoreductase-efficient environmentally important 40  
strain L2.  41  .

1. Introduction 45  
Azo dyes are one of the largest classes of dyeing chemicals that account for >70% of the 46  
global industrial dye requirement of around 9 million tons (Rawat et al., 2018; Sarvajith et 47  
al., 2018; Guo et al., 2020; Routoula and Patwardhan, 2020). Due to their genotoxic and 48  
carcinogenic capability, the annual disposal of ~4,500,000 tons of azo dyes and their 49  
metabolites are an environmental and financial task (Rawat et al., 2016). For the 50  
developing economy, azo compounds and their metabolism, in various biological systems 51  
is a top-order agenda of the environment protection and conservation agency which are 52  
mainly applied in the textile industry. As per estimates, ~12% of textile-industry associated 53  
synthetic azo dyes utilized annually are discharged to wastewater resources. Due to 54  
inadequate effluent treatment, these account for ~20% of the total dye pollution to the 55  
environment (Saratale et al., 2011). In the last few decades, multiple biological treatments 56  
have been attempted using various individual strains and artificial or acclimatized 57  
consortia which can bioremediate azo dyes efficiently (Rathod and Archana, 2013; Patel et 58  
al., 2016; Rathod et al., 2017; Sreedharan and Bhaskara Rao, 2019; Guo et al., 2021; 59  
Samuchiwal et al., 2021), and hunt of new effective strains and their further optimizations 60  
remains a challenging task till now. 61  
Azo (-N=N-) bond reduction or decolorization has been the bottle-neck step of the 62  
dye degradation pathway, and each strain possesses its unique mode of azo dye 63  
decolorization (Sreedharan and Bhaskara Rao, 2019). Multiple mechanisms such as 64  
enzymatic, non-specific redox mediator based or direct reduction by reduced metabolites 65  .

 including quinones that can extracellularly reduce azo dye (Stolz, 2001; Chengalroyen and 66  
Dabbs, 2013; Rathod et al., 2017)Hong and Gu, 2010).  67  
Enzymatically azoreductase, mono-di oxygenase, peroxidase, laccase, and flavin 68  
reductase are the main set of enzymes catalyzing azo decolorization (Chen, 2006; Pandey 69  
et al., 2021), out of them azoreductases are recognized critical catalytical component of 70  
xenobiotic metabolism and found to be omnipresent in the various biological system 71  
(Bafana and Chakrabarti, 2008) (Misal and Gawai, 2018). Azoreductases are also known to 72  
possess flavin-dependent quinone reductase activity (Deller et al., 2008; Leelakriangsak, 73  
2013; Suzuki, 2019; Rathod et al., 2022). To catalyze azo cleavage, azoreductases derive 74  
reduction potentials from either NADH, NADPH or FADH 2 (Morrison et al., 2012; Punj 75  
and John, 2009).  Out of all oxidoreductases, ~80% of enzymes require NADH as a co- 76  
factor compared to only up to 10% requiring NADPH (Wu et al., 2013). Therefore, the 77  
availability of intracellular NADH to an efficient azoreductase activity remains a 78  
competitive metabolic challenge (Rathod et al., 2017). Further, the augmentation of the 79  
NADPH-regeneration system is highly complex, and their metabolic requirement of 80  
fastidious metabolites (Oeggl et al., 2018), makes it unfavorable for bioremediation 81  
application. Previously, we have reported a single gene amended efficient NADH- 82  
regeneration system which has been reported to increase azo dye reduction in model 83  
bacterial systems. However, their compatibility in non-conventional and environmentally 84  
important azo dye reducers has not been studied. 85  
This study aims to characterize azo dye decolorization and azoreductase profiles of 86  
unique bacterial strains isolated from our lab enriched acclimatized consortia Rathod and 87  
Archana (2013). Among these isolates, we selected the most efficient Enterococcus  sp. L2 88  
possessing a native NADH-dependent azoreductase activity to further improvise its azo 89  .

 dye decolorization profile. To achieve this, we heterologously overexpress Mycobacterium  90  
vaccae encoded NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase in strain L2 to replenish the 91  
intracellular NADH pool which is required for efficient azoreductase catalysis. Ultimately, 92  
we could accomplish a significant enhancement in azo dye reduction in a non-model and 93  
bioremediation points of view important strain. 94

2. Materials and methods 96  
2.1.Azo dye decolorization studies   97  
Reactive Violet 5R (RV5R) was used as the model azo dye which consists of a mono 98  
azo group linking benzene and a naphthalene ring (Jain et al., 2012; Rathod et al., 99  
2017). RV5R was procured from Meghmani Dyes And Intermediates Ltd, GIDC Vatva, 100  
Ahmedabad, India. Methyl red was obtained from HiMedia Laboratories, India. The 101  
Bushnell Haas Medium (BHM) [MgSO 4, 0.2 g/L; K 2HPO 4, 1.0 g/L; CaCl 2, 0.02 g/L; 102  
FeCl 3, 0.05 g/L; NH 4NO 3, 1.0 g/L] and various media components used in this study 103  
were from HiMedia Laboratories, India. Considering the consortium source of isolate 104  
the following media were used, 1) BHM with 0.5% w/v glucose and 0.5% w/v yeast 105  
extract as medium A used for isolate ME1; BHM with 0.5% v/v glycerol and 0.5% w/v 106  
yeast extract used as medium B for isolate A3; 2% w/v peptone, 0.15% w/v K 2HPO 4, 107  
0.15% w/v MgS0 4, 1% (v/ v) glycerol used as medium C for isolate E2 and K1, and 4) 108  
1.5% w/v Tryptone, 0.5% w/v soya peptone, 0.5% w/v NaCl used as medium D for 109  
isolate C1, G1, L1 and L2. Filter-sterilized solution of RV5R and MR dyes was added 110  
to obtain its 100 mg/L final concentration in media. To evaluate the NAD+-dependent 111  
formate dehydrogenase over-expression studies medium with chloramphenicol 10 µg/ 112  
ml was used. Dye decolorization at different intervals was monitored by withdrawing 113  .

 aliquots and followed by centrifugation at 14,000  g for 10 min to isolate the bacterial 114  
cell mass. By measuring the absorbance of the supernatant at maximum wavelength for 115  
the Reactive Violet 5R ( λmax = 558nm) and Methyl red ( λmax = 420 nm) using Spectronic 116  
20D+ (Thermo Scientific) the decolorization percentage was calculated using below 117  
equation,  118  
 Decolorization (%) = [O.D. at time (t 0) - O.D. at time (t 1)] /O.D. at time (t 0) * 100. Dye 119  
decolorization experiments were done in triplicates.  120  
2.2.Identification of bacterial isolates by 16S rRNA gene sequencing  121  
For genomic DNA isolation, freshly grown cells were harvested from 2 mL of the 122  
culture suspension by centrifugation at 14,000  g, 4°C for 10 min. Cell pellet was 123  
resuspended in TE25S buffer followed by lysis and purification steps as per standard 124  
molecular biology protocols (Sambrook and Russel, 2001). Finally, DNA was dissolved 125  
in 50 µl TE buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). Using eubacterial universal 126  
primers 27F and 1107R, 16S rRNA gene was amplified using PCR (Chaturvedi and 127  
Archana, 2012). The PCR product was sequenced using reverse primer (1107R), 128  
generating optimum sequence length for the identification (Pillai and Archana, 2008). 129  
The sequence data were analyzed using RDP database. MEGA 4.0 was used to 130  
construct the phylogenetic tree. Additionally, bacterial identifications were further 131  
confirmed using biochemical tests specified by Bergey’s manual (Staley J.R., 2001). 132  
Growth analysis was performed by withdrawing cell suspension aliquots at time 133  
intervals. To avoid any spectral interference of the residual dye, harvested cells were 134  
washed with PBS and growth was measured by taking O.D. at 600nm. Growth 135  
experiments were done in triplicates. 136  .

 2.3.Nucleotide sequence accession numbers  137  
All the isolates’ 16S ribosomal RNA sequence GenBank accession number are JQ745287- 138  
94. 139  
2.4.Azoreductase assay 140  
Azoreductase assay was performed by quantifying the reduction in optical density at λmax 141  
of the Reactive violet 5R dye with a Shimadzu UV–visible spectrophotometer at room 142  
temperature. The reaction mixture (1.0 ml) contained 25mM potassium phosphate buffer 143  
(pH 7.1), 25 µM azo dye, 0.1mM NADH, 10 µM FMN, and a appropriate amount of 144  
enzyme. The reaction was initiated by the NADH and quick mixing. One unit (U) of 145  
enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme needed to decolorize 1 µmole of azo 146  
dye/min/mg of total protein (Chen et al., 2004). Protein concentration was quantified using 147  
the Bradford assay (Pierce) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as the standard. 148  
2.5.Functional group identification of RV5R degradation products by Fourier 149  
Transformed Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)  150  
Decolorization or degradation products of azo dye by isolates was studied by FTIR 151  
analysis. Endpoint metabolites were extracted by an equal volume of ethyl acetate and 152  
dried in SpeedVac (Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham, MA). FTIR Analysis was 153  
done by mixing with HPLC grade potassium bromide (KBr) in the ratio of 5:95 and 154  
analyzed at mid-IR region (400–4000 cm−1) by FTIR using Spectrum GX (PerkinElmer, 155  
USA). 156

 Enterococcus  sp. L2 being a Gram-positive isolate, we used pMGS100 p bacA including its 159  
ribosome-binding site-driven  constitutive expression system. The plasmid pMGS100 fdh 160  
was constructed by cloning of coding region (ORF) of myc fdh amplified using primers 161  
MGS100 fdhF (5’ ATG GCA AAG GTC CTG TGC GTT CTT TAC G 3’) and Myc fdhR (5’ 162  
TAT AGG TAC CTT CGG ATC CTC AGA CCG CCTT CTT GA 3’) into NruI site of 163  
pMGS100. Clones with correct orientation of fdh with constitutive promoter of bacitracin 164  
resistance gene (p bacA ) were screened by BamHI digestion and pcr conformation. In vitro 165  
handling of DNA molecules for cloning was done utilizing standard protocols (Sambrook 166  
and Russel, 2001). The pMGS100 fdh was transferred to Enterococcus sp. L2 using 167  
protoplast electroporation describe by (Dunny et al., 1991).  168  
2.7.SDS-PAGE analysis 169  
Cells were harvested and heat-lysed using a boiling water bath for 15 min. A 170  
resolving gel (12%) and separating gel were used for SDS-PAGE and as a molecular 171  
weight standard protein marker (97, 66, 43, 29, 20, 14kDa) (Merck, India) was used. 172  
SDS-PAGE gels were run in 5X Tris-glycine buffer at 70 V for initial 15-20 min and 173  
then, at 100 V up to 2h. After electrophoresis, proteins on gels were visualized by 174  
staining with 0.25% Coomassie brilliant blue R250 and de-stained according to 175  
Sambrook and Russel (2001). 176  
 177  
2.8.NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase assay 178  
To assay NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase (Fdh) activity, whole-cell 179  
lysate was prepared as mentioned for azoreductase activity in sodium phosphate buffer 180  
at pH 7.5 along with 0.1M β mercaptoethanol according to Rathod et al. 2017. Using 181  
molar extinction coefficient of NADH as 6220 M-1 cm-1 enzyme units were calculated. 182  .

 One unit (U) of Fdh is defined as the enzyme needed to oxidize 1 µmole formate per 183  
minute. Using Bradford method, total protein concentration in cell extracts was 184  
measured and bovine serum albumin was utilized as standard. 185  
2.9.Intracellular reducing equivalent estimation   186  
Cultures were grown overnight medium containing chloramphenicol 10 µg/ ml. To a re- 187  
inoculated freshly grown culture, at the mid-log phase (0.4 O.D.) 1mM IPTG was added 188  
which was induced for 6 h along with amendment of 300mM Na-formate. This induced 189  
cell culture was centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 min and the resulting pellet was washed 190  
twice with 0.01M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). Decanted pellet was resuspended 191  
in 1mL 0.01M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and sonicated for 3 min by using 192  
Sonics VibraCellTM, USA. After centrifugation at 14,000  g, 4°C for 10 min  cell debris 193  
were removed and supernatant as cell lysate was used to estimate the reducing 194  
equivalents. Using nanophotometer (Implen, GmbH) [NADH] at 340 nm and  [Protein 195  
concentration] at 280nm was measured, and [NADH]/[Protein] as 340/280 nm ratio was 196  
determined. 197  
2.10. Statistical analysis  198  
The significant differences among the different treatments were analyzed by one-way 199  
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a pairwise multiple comparison procedure (Fishers 200  
LSD). T-test has been performed between treatments of redox mediators to control as 201  
well as over-expressing fdh transformant to vector control. Sigma Stat 3.5 was used for 202  
the statistical analysis. 203

 In our previous study by Rathod and Archana (2013), we have reported the enrichment of 207  
twelve acclimatized Reactive violet 5R decolorizing effective consortia from diverse 208  
environmental pools. The study also reported a total of 28 isolates from these consortia. 209  
These consortia harbored several heterogeneous, active, and profound azo dye decolorizing 210  
members which have the potential for efficient azo dye bioremediation. Based on the 211  
efficient decolorization properties, out of 28, eight isolates were selected for further 212  
taxonomic identification and characterization.  213  
These potential isolates were analyzed for decolorization of complex model dye Reactive 214  
violet 5R (RV5R) and Methyl red (mono azo with two benzene rings, MR) in their native 215  
growth media of respective consortium. Isolates L2 and ME1 were found to decolorize 216  
RV5R more than 90% in 3 h (Figure 1a). Isolate C1 and G1 took up to 30h to decolorize 217  
up to 90%. Decolorization of methyl red (mono azo, benzene rings containing dye) was 218  
studied for these isolates, resulted 99% decolorization of MR by isolates L2 and ME1 by 219  
6h and isolate C1 decolorized 98% of MR decolorization by C1 isolate in 12 h (Figure 1b), 220  
whereas the rest of the isolates took 18h to decolorize MR more than 90%. The chemical 221  
structures of the model dyes used in this study are depicted in Figure. 1c, d.  222  
  Table 1 shows the phylogenetic affiliation of the eight isolates based on 16S rRNA gene 223  
sequence. Biochemical key identification results are given in Tables S1-4. The Gram 224  
positive were identified as Enterococcus  spp., whereas six of the gram negatives were 225  
found to belong to /i4-Proteobacteria, out of which two belonged to Providencia and 226  
Klebsiella spp. , whereas remaining two were similar to Acinetobacter and Citrobacter 227  
genera. Using16S rRNA gene sequence similarities, best matches were selected along with 228  
their 16S rRNA sequences from Ribosome data project (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/) for 229  
building phylogenetic tree (Figure 1e). The optimal tree with the sum of branch length was 230  .

 0.37043799. Further, we correlated the identified member strains with previously reported 231  
taxonomic neighbors with dye bioremediation features and their mode of azo dye 232  
reduction. Klebsiella  spp. have been known for micro-aerophilic -aerobic sequential 233  
decolorization/degradation process of various textile azo dyes (Franciscon et al., 2009). 234  
Klebsiella  spp. obtained in these studies showed 99% phylogenetic similarity with the 235  
reported Klebsiella  strains showing heavy metal resistance, heavy metals are widely used 236  
for the chemical stability of the azo dye and found to be major co-contaminant in the 237  
effluents of dye manufacture and application industries. Interestingly, isolate Klebsiella  sp. 238  
E2 showed phylogenetic similarity with copper resistant Klebsiella  pneumoniae  strain SW 239  
(accession no. AB641122) and Klebsiella  sp. K1 with nickel resistant Klebsiella  240  
pneumoniae strain ZB (accession no. KC243315) (Table. 1). Azo-reducing bacteria  such as  241  
Shewanella, Citrobacter, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas have shown to reduce azo dyes 242  
with molecular H 2, electron donors which includes short-chain fatty acids and redox 243  
mediators that are known to profoundly involved in dye decolorization (Hong et al., 2008; 244  
Cui et al., 2020). Thus, obtained isolates specifically Enterococcus  sp. L2 from the current 245  
study should be further investigated for their best potentials. 246  
3.2.Azoreductase profiling of isolates  247  
Among different enzymes catalyzing dye decolorization step, a significant role is 248  
contributed by azoreductase in different microbial systems (Liu et al., 2009; Punj and John, 249  
2009; Chen et al., 2010; Husain and Husain, 2012). Azoreductase activity was detected 250  
from the isolates, and Enterococcus L2 and ME1 had highest NADH- and NADPH- 251  
dependent azoreductase activities compared to the rest of the isolates (Table 2). 252  
Enterococcus  L2 and ME1 showed NADH-azoreductase specific activity of 18.73 ± 1.91 253  
and 8.89 ± 1.23, whereas NADPH-azoreductase specific activities were 29.87 ± 2.14 and 254  .

 15.48 ± 0.57, respectively. Liu et al., (2007) characterized the azoA gene from 255  
Enterococcus faecalis  as broad substrate aerobic FMN dependent NADH- azoreductase 256  
homodimer of 23kDa subunits. Furthermore, Macwana et al., (2010) characterized acpD  257  
gene product AzoEf1 from Enterococcus faecium  as utilized both NADH and NADPH for 258  
the reduction of azo dyes. Although, Enterococcus  sp. L2 has both NADH- and NADPH- 259  
dependent azoreductase activities, strengthening the NADH-azoreductase catalysis in 260  
strain L2 will be advantageous and physiologically feasible modification as mentioned 261  
earlier to optimize azo dye decolorization.  262  
 263  
3.3. Enhancement of RV5R decolorization by preferred redox mediators 264  
Redox mediators involvement in bacterial -N=N- bond reductive cleavage under anaerobic 265  
condition have been reported (dos Santos et al., 2003; Van der Zee and Cervantes, 2009; Li 266  
et al., 2021), however, their preferences in microbial system and their participation in 267  
aerobic conditions for the dye decolorization remains vaguely defined. Flavin enzyme 268  
cofactors, such as flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), flavin adenine mononucleotide 269  
(FMN) and riboflavin, along with other quinone compounds, such as Anthraquinone-2, 6- 270  
disulfonate (AQDS), Anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (AQS), and lawsone, are known redox 271  
mediators. Most of azoreductases which plays direct role in azo dye decolorization also 272  
belong to flavin dependent quinone reductase family, thus physiologically have the ability 273  
to accept quinones as substrates (Liu et al., 2008; Rathod et al., 2022). Different 274  
concentrations 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0% of Menadione, AQS, AQDS and 1% Lawsone were 275  
checked to see the effect of the redox mediators on RV5R decolorization. In the presence 276  
of 2.0 mM Menadione the bacterial isolates Klebsiella spp.  K1 and E2 and Acinetobacter 277  
sp. L1 had removed approximately double the amount of the dye i.e. 91.82%, 87.89% and 278  .

 74.46% respectively than the control within 15 h (Figure 2a). In case of increase in the 279  
menadione concentration from >1.0 mM enhance decolorization of the RV5R, except 280  
Enterococcus  spp. Providencia  spp. showed range specific the positive decolorization 281  
effect for menadione which corroborated results by Rau et al., (2002) using menadione. 282  
We predict that menadione being electrophilic quinone in nature; imposed oxidative stress 283  
on Citrobacter sp. A3, Enterococcus sp. L2 and Enterococcus sp. ME1 which at high 284  
concentrations might have led to negative effect decolorization. Significant results were 285  
obtained in presence of AQS and AQDS showing ~10 to 20% increase in decolorization at 286  
optimum concentration. It was also found that isolates also decrease decolorization beyond 287  
optimum concentration of quinones (Figure2b, c). In case of Klebsiella  strains effect of 288  
most of the redox mediators were found to be highly significant, although only Klebsiella  289  
sp. K1 shown 1.6 fold increases in RV5R decolorization in 1% lawsone (Figure 2d) which 290  
is corroborated with the results by Olivo-Alanis et al. (2018). The enhancement mechanism 291  
of redox mediators have been elucidated by Zee and Villaverde, (2005), as redox mediators 292  
(RMs) accelerate the reaction rate by coupling the microbial oxidation of primary electron 293  
donors via shuttling electrons to the acceptor azo dyes (Van der Zee et al., 2003). Yeast 294  
extract has demonstrated to improve azo dye decolorization as it can serve as a source of 295  
reducing equivalents and electron shuttle which can reduce azo dye (Imran et al., 2016). 296  
Hydroxyquinone was also checked for its effect on decolorization, which was found 297  
negative (data not shown). Ultimately, a strain-specific effect of RMs was observed on azo 298  
dye decolorization as these isolates were equipped by unique set of quinone reductase 299  
system which also includes many azoreductases.  300

 Functional groups absorption peaks shifting or dis-appearance in treated samples to control 303  
dye sample demonstrates various steps or chemical modifications of the 304  
decolorization/degradation process (Jain et al., 2012; Patel et al., 2020). FTIR spectrum 305  
form decolorized end product was extracted and compared with the control (RV5R) 306  
(Figure S1a-i). Reactive Violet 5R FTIR spectra of as control showed signature peaks for 307  
multi-substituted benzene ring along with the peaks at 1,139, 1,185 and 1,547 cm-1 which 308  
corresponds to two -SO 3H group, a symmetric SO 2 and azo bone, respectively (Desai et al. 309  
2009). Azo bond peak at 1547 cm-1 was prime signature of a mono-azo reactive azo dye 310  
RV5R and loss of this peak in the decolorized extracts of various culture supernatants 311  
determined the cleavage of the azo bond (Table 3). FTIR analysis of extracted metabolites 312  
of degraded RV5R showed peaks 1630- 1680cm-1 of primary amines. The peak 313  
corresponding to -CN asymmetric stretching at 1048.48 cm-1 and -SO3H group 1139.89 314  
and 1185.13 cm-1 peak was also disappeared, in all the strains except in Acinetobacter  sp. 315  
L1. Further suggesting that these isolates were capable of removing the sulfonate group 316  
from the dye structure and reducing its charge properties, which might enable them to pass 317  
through the membrane barrier. The asymmetrical stretching of C–H of alkane (-CH 3) peak 318  
between 2,920-2930 cm-1 were observed in degraded metabolites which is corroborated 319  
with the findings of asymmetrical C–H stretching in degradation of disperse dye Brown 320  
3REL by Bacillus sp. VUS (Dawkar et al. 2008). Thus, these consortial isolates are 321  
expected to play a vital and active role in azo dye decolorization and effective 322  
bioremediation even as pure culture.  323

 The Enterococcus sp. L2 was found to decolorize RV5 dye (100mg/L) at an optimum 327  
medium pH of 7-8 and temperature 40 /i4C under static conditions (Figure 3a, b). The 328  
isolate showed complete decolorization between 35 to 40 /i4C, however sharp decrease in 329  
the decolorization was observed above and below this optimum range (Figure 3b). 330  
Similarly, Sahasrabudhe et al. (2011) reported Enterococcus  strain to decolorize Reactive 331  
yellow at an optimum pH 5 and temperature for the decolorization at 37/i1C. Maximum 332  
RV5R decolorization was found to be in the range of 0.5-2% NaCl (Figure 3c), which is 333  
the survival and growth range of salinity for Enterococcus spp. (Fisher & Phillips, 2009). 334  
Recently, similar halo-tolerant and thermophilic bacterial system have been reported for 335  
the dye decolorization application (Guo et al., 2021). Interestingly, during Enterococcus  336  
sp. L2 growth and azo dye decolorization, a significant pH drop was also observed (Figure 337  
3d). Flahaut et. al (1996) reported “flash adaptation” in E. faecalis,  which makes this 338  
bacteria ideal for survival and growth under stress conditions under the bioremediation 339  
category. Therefore, Enterococcus  sp. L2 was selected for additional evaluations. 340  
3.6. Augmentation of NADH-regeneration systems by heterologous 341  
overexpression of NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase to further enhance 342  
decolorization potential of Enterococcus  sp. L2  343  
The selected isolate, Enterococcus  sp. L2, was shown to possess NAD(P)H- 344  
azoreductase activity, and these reducing equivalences are essential co-factors for 345  
azoreductase. While NADH regeneration is physiologically more feasible compared to 346  
NADPH 2 (Oeggl et al., 2018), therefore,  we decide to further enhance the NADH to 347  
support azoreductase catalysis. To replenish the NADH pool, NAD+-dependent formate 348  
dehydrogenase was employed which oxidize formate to H 2O and CO 2 while reducing 349  
NAD+ to NADH. Using pMGS100, a Gram-positive expression vector the 350  .

 Mycobacterium  vaccae  encoded NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase was 351  
heterologously overexpressed by a constitutive bacA  promoter (Figure 4a). A pMGS100 352  
fdh construct was confirmed by BamH1 digestion and a PCR amplification (Figure 4b, 353  
c). Enterococcus sp. L2 harboring pMGS100 fdh showed the expected overexpressed 354  
protein band of 44kDa (Figure 4d). Enterococcus sp. L2 fdh transformant showed 355  
specific activity of 12.56 U/mg with a fold increase of 6.05 compared to its vector 356  
control (Figure 4e). The absorbance ratio of A 340/280nm  was used as a measure of 357  
intracellular NADH concentration relative to the total protein concentration. In medium 358  
amended with 300mM Na-formate the average absorbance for A 340/280nm  ratio for vector 359  
control and fdh transformant were 0.395 ± 0.009 and 0.455 ± 0.012, respectively. This 360  
determined a 1.15 fold NADH increase in fdh transformant. Additionally, Enterococcus  361  
spp. are known to accumulate formate (Leblanc, 2006), and they do not possess 362  
formate-hydrogen lyase enzymes or native NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase 363  
activity, therefore, a significant incorporation of final formate oxidation linked to co- 364  
factor reductive regeneration. Ultimately, Enterococcus sp. L2 fdh transformant showed 365  
73.45% decolorization compared to only 22.97% RV5R decolorization by control in 6h, 366  
demonstrating a 3.2 fold increase (Figure 4f). This augmentation also led to a significant 367  
physiological advantage with positive effect on growth when cell grown with or without 368  
supplement of 300mM formate amendment as shown in figure 4g, h. This could be 369  
attributed to modified enterococcal system which is now able to utilize formate for the 370  
regeneration of NADH when formate was added externally. Enterococcus  spp. possess 371  
pyruvate formate lyase which also naturally produces formate as they could not further 372  
utilize it (Leblanc, 2006; Ramsey et al., 2014). Natural accumulation of formate as 373  
terminal product of C-metabolism supports the implemented formate dehydrogenase 374  .

 driven NADH-regeneration in fdh transformant even when no external formate is added. 375  
It is noteworthy that fdh-based NADH-regeneration system augmentation in 376  
Enterococcus  sp. L2 could boost its azo dye decolorization and growth. 377  
3.7. Potential of NADH-regeneration system in xenobiotic remediation  378  
4. Conclusion 379  
Among azo dye decolorizing bacterial isolates from acclimatized consortia, Enterococcus  380  
sp. L2 was recognized as the most efficient azo dye decolorizer by reducing >90mg/L 381  
Reactive violet 5R (RV5R) dye in 3h. A strain-specific preference for redox mediators was 382  
demonstrated. A low-cost redox mediator, crude lawsone powder (1%) extract of Lawsonia 383  
inermis showed positive effect on Klebsiella  sp. K1’s dye decolorization only. At optimum 384  
concentration, AQDS was found to be most preferred redox mediator enhancing dye 385  
decolorization in all isolates. It is noteworthy that strain L2 is a NAD(P)H-dependent 386  
azoreductase efficient system. Further, strain L2 showed an optimum decolorization at pH 387  
8, 40 °C and up to 2% w/v salinity that were supporting physiochemical features for 388  
utilizing strain L2 for biological treatment. NADH-regeneration augmentation in 389  
Enterococcus  sp. L2 by overexpressing NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase could 390  
enhance NADH pool leading to a significant 3.2 fold increased dye decolorization with a 391  
positive effect on growth. Ultimately, this study highlighted salient azo dye decolorization 392  
traits of strain L2 and its possibility of further optimization by an augmentation of NADH- 393  
regeneration system in the non-model azoreductase-efficient environmentally important 394  
strain.  395

Figure 1. Azo dye decolorization and 16S rRNA gene based phylogenetic analysis of isolates. a) 
RV5R decolorization; b) Methyl red (MR) decolorization; c) Structure of Reactive violet 5R 
(RV5R); d) Structure of Methyl red (MR); e) Unrooted phylogenetic tree depicting taxonomic affiliations of the azo dye decolorizing bacterial isolates. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in 
MEGA4. RV5R decolorizing isolates of the present study are indicated by dark circles. The 
percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) is shown next to the branches. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in 
the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The 
evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site (scale bar corresponds to 0.2 nucleotide 
substitution per site). All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the 
dataset (Complete deletion option). Figure 2. Effect of redox mediators on Reactive violet 5R decolorization. a) Menadione (1, 1.5, 2 
mM) b) Anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (AQS) (1, 1.5, 2 mM) c) Anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate 
(AQDS) (1, 1.5, 2 mM) d) 1% crude Lawsone. Asterisk sign denotes the statistical significance at p 
< 0.05 for the increase in dye decolorization amended with specific redox mediator at respective 
concentration compared to control of without amendment of electron mediator.
