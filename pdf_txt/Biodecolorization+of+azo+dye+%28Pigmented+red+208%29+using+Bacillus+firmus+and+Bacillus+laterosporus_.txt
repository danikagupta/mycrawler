INTRODUCTION
 
 
Environmental pollution caused by the release of a wide range 
of azo dyes through industrial wastewater is a serious problem 
in present days. Dyes are an important class of synthetic 
organic compounds, widely used in textile, leather, plastic, 
cosmetic and
 
food industries and are therefore common 
industrial pollutants. Textile effluent released from industries 
is a complex mixture of many polluting substances such as 
organo chlorine based pesticides, heavy metals, pigments and 
dyes (Saraswathy and Balakumar
, 2009) and must be treated 
before discharged into environment because of their 
recalcitrant nature and potential toxicity to animals and human 
(Levine 
et al
., 1991; Hildenbrand 
et al
., 1999; Martins 
2002). Dyes also obstruct light penetration and 
that affects water bodies (Franciscon 
et al
., 2009). In recent 
years, numerous studies were carried out for the decolorization 
of textile effluent, including various physicochemical methods 
such as filtration, coagulation, chemical floccula
activated carbon, advanced oxidation processes, ion exchange, 
electrochemical and membrane process. Few of them are 
effective but with high cost, low efficiency and lack of 
selectivity of the process (Maier 
et al
., 2004; Kurniawan 
2006
).
 
The treatment processes are based on the 
microorganisms capable of decolorizing or degrading these 
recalcitrant compounds.

Bacterial Isolation and Cultivation 
 
 
For isolation of bacteria, soil samples were collected as sources 
for bacteria. Numerous colonies were obtained through serial 
dilution method. Isolated colonies were then obtained through 
streaking method on nutrient agar. Each strain was then 
inoculated 
into nutrient broth and incubated for 24 h at 37 
0
C 
on a platform shaker at 150 rpm. A 10% (v/v) inoculum was 
transferred into 250 mL flask containing 100 mL LB media 
and incubated similarly.  After 24 h, 10% (v/v) samples were 
sub
-
cultured into fresh LB m
edia containing the respective 
dyes and further incubated as described above. Strains capable 
of utilising fresh dyes as a nutrient source were plated on 
MSM plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. It was from these 
plates; isolated colonies were taken and
 
repeatedly streaked on 
nutrient agar to obtain pure cultures. The pure bacterial 
cultures were subsequently transferred into nutrient broth.
 
 
Screening for Bacteria Decolourising Capability Using 
Selected Azo Dye
 
 
The bacterial isolates were cultivated in
 
nutrient broth 24 hours 
before screening was done in MSM media. For initial 
screening, 0.1% (v/v) aliquot of each isolated strain in nutrient 
broth was inoculated into MSM, each containing 200 µL 
individual dye solutions. Decolourisation of the dye soluti
on 
was monitored visually after 24 h incubation. Strains that 
showed high decolourising potential were chosen to be tested 
further using dye incorporated in MSM agar plate.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In secondary screening using dye incorporated MSM agar 
plates, the selected isolates were first inoculated into the 
nutrient broth for 24 h. The culture was then lawned onto the 
agar and left for another 24 h before any decolourisation zone 
was noted. Resp
ective dye incorporated agars without any 
inoculums were used as controls and the decolourisation were 
estimated visually by comparing the inoculated plates with 
those of the control plates after 24 to 72 h. Final screening 
using selected dyes in MSM liqui
d media were initially done 
using smaller volume of samples.  Each selected strain was 
inoculated into flasks containing 10 mL nutrient broth and 
allowed to grow for 24 h. A sample of 10% (v/v) of the aliquot 
was then transferred into flasks containing 10 
mL of MSM 
media.
 
 
In secondary screening percent decolorization was measured as 
decrease in optical density using spectrophotometer
. 
Percentage decolorization was calculated as follows:
 
 
 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
 
 
A total of 18 cultures of bacteria were isolated, purified and 
screened for the degradation of azo dyes from textile effluent 
and sludge sample. Of all the cultures tested, 6 bacterial 
isolates (were further screened for dyes degradation on the 
basis of dy
es tolerance i.e., resistance in minimal medium 
containing 2% of reactive light red dye.Table 1 shows different 
bacterial strains isolated from the Soil which were screened for 
their ability to decolorize textile dye and the potential strains 
were morpholo
gically and biochemically characterized for 
identification. Based on preliminary tests and secondary 
screening, plating on selective media and biochemical tests, 
they were identified as 
Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas 
florescence, Proteus mirabilis, Alca
ligens sp, Serratia 
marscens 
and
 
E.coli
 
and were selected for pink and orange dye 
degradation.
 
The rate of decolourization increased with 
increase in initial dye concentration from 10 to 100 mg/L, 
showed 91.14 % percentage of decolourization for pink colou
r 
dye and 93.6 % for orange colour dye. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Similar results were mentioned by Khalid 
et al.
 
(2008). Dye 
concentration can influence the efficiency of microbial 
decolourization through a combination of factors including the 
toxicity imposed by dye at higher concentration (Sahasrabudhe 
and Pathade, 2011). 
 
 
Conclusion
 
 
Soil is rich source of dye d
ecolorizing bacterial population. 
The ability of isolated bacterial culture showing 91.1% 
decolourization for Pink dye in soil isolates thus suggesting
