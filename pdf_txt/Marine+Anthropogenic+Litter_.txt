Synthetic polymers, commonly known as plastics, have made themselves a perma-
nent part of the marine environment for the first time in the long history of plane-tary seas. No sediment or ice core will reveal ancient deposits of these materials or the biological consequences associated with high concentrations of synthetic poly-mers in the planet’s prehistoric ocean. However, current ice and sediment cores do reveal an abundance of this material. Only a broad combination of traditional fields of scientific inquiry is adequate to uncover the effects of this new pollutant, and it seems a pity that a field of study, rather than springing from insights into natural phenomena, arises from new ways that natural phenomena are compromised.
Reports of plastics in the marine environment began to appear in the early 1970s. 
At the time, Edward Carpenter of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution specu-lated that the problem was likely to get worse and that toxic, non-polymeric com-pounds in plastics known as plasticizers could be delivered to marine organisms as a potential effect. Carpenter’s speculations were correct and probably more so than he imagined. The quantity of plastics in ocean waters has increased enormously, and toxic plastic additives, as well as toxicants concentrated by plastics from the surrounding sea water, have been documented in many marine species.
The rapid expansion of the use of synthetic polymers over the last half century 
has been such that the characterization of the current era as the “Age of Plastics”, seems appropriate. There is no real mystery as to why plastics have become the predominant material of the current epoch. The use value of the material is truly surprising. It can substitute for nearly every traditional material from millinery to metal and offers qualities unknown in naturally occurring substances, so that it now feeds a worldwide industry. The plastic industry creates new applications and products with growth trending sharply upward and showing no signs of slowing in the foreseeable future. Laser printing using plastic “ink” will guarantee expanded use of polymeric feedstocks.
Although the majority of plastics produced today use petroleum resources 
which are finite, the carbon backbone of synthetic polymers can be fashioned from switchgrass, soya beans, corn, sugar cane or other renewable resources—price alone determines industry’s preference. The fact that synthetic polymers can Foreword viii
be made from row crops (so-called biopolymers) need have nothing to do with 
their biodegradability. Olefins are still olefins and acrylates are still acrylates, and behave like their petroleum-fabricated counterparts. Furthermore, biodegradability standards are not applicable in the marine environment and marine degradability requires a separate standard. Marine degradable plastics have a negligible market share and are not poised to make headway into the consumer plastics market at the present time. The difficulty of recycling plastics has made their profitable recovery a problem, which in turn results in failure to provide take-back infrastructure and results in accelerated pollution.
Given the proliferation of plastics into all spheres of human activity, and their 
increasing use value in the developing world, the phenomena associated with plas-tic pollution of the marine environment will continue to merit scientific investi-gation. These studies, however, are hampered by the lack of basic geospatial and quantitative data. Estimates abound based on limited sampling and modeling, but the ocean is the biggest habitat on the planet by far and knowledge of its plas-tic pollution will require new methods of data acquisition. The role of citizens in the monitoring of plastic pollution will increase in the coming years, and the truly “big” data they document must become part of the science of plastic pollution. For the present, it is fortunate that a few pioneering scientists around the world are engaged in attempting to understand the consequences of the plague of plastic that contaminates our precious ocean.

http://www.algalita.orgixPreface
The ocean is of eminent importance to mankind. Twenty-three per cent of the 
world’s population (~1.2 billion people) live within 100 km of the coast (Small and Nicholls 2003), a figure, which is likely to rise up to 50 % by 2030 (Adger et al. 2005). Furthermore, the ocean sustains nearly half of the global primary pro-
duction (Field et al. 1998), a great share of which fuels global fisheries (Pauly and Christensen 1995). The marine environment hosts a substantial biodiversity, and tourism is an important and constantly growing economic sector for many coastal countries. Although human welfare is intricately linked with the sea and its natural resources, people have substantially altered the face of the ocean within only a few centuries. Fisheries, pollution, eutrophication, deep-sea hydrocarbon exploration, ocean acidification and global ocean warming accompanied by sea-level rise as a consequence of rapid glacier melting and thermal expansion of sea water (IPCC 2014) are prominent examples of man-made pressures exerted on the oceans with severe ecological and socio-economic repercussions. As a result, marine environ-mental protection and management have become integral political and societal issues in many countries worldwide. However, effective environmental manage-ment requires a proper understanding of the ecological implications of human activities and should, therefore, be accompanied by sound multidisciplinary research, scientific advice, education and public outreach.
In recent decades, the pollution of the oceans by anthropogenic litter has been 
recognized as a serious global environmental concern. Marine litter is defined as “any persistent, manufactured or processed solid material discarded, disposed of or abandoned in the marine and coastal environment” (UNEP 2009). Since its first mention in the scientific literature in the 1960s, research efforts addressing marine litter have constantly grown as has the amount of litter in the oceans. Many stud-ies have shown that it consists primarily of plastics with a continuously increas-ing global annual production of 299 million t (PlasticsEurope 2015). It has been estimated that 10 % of all plastic debris ends up in the oceans (Thompson 2006), and Barnes (2005) suggested that the 1982 figure of 8 million litter items entering the oceans every day probably needs to be multiplied several fold. Eriksen et al. (2014) estimate a minimum of 5.25 trillion plastic particles weighing 268,940 tons  Preface x
afloat in the sea, but this figure does not include debris on the seafloor or beaches. 
The increasing use of single-use products, uncontrolled disposal of litter along with poor waste management and recycling practices is the main reason for the accumulation of litter in the sea. Increasing quantities of litter are lost from munic-ipal waste streams and enter the oceans (Barnes et al. 2009). The ubiquity of litter in the open ocean is prominently illustrated by numerous images of floating debris from the ocean garbage patches and by the fact that the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in March 2014 produced quite a few misidentifi-cations caused by litter floating at the water surface.
Since plastic accounts for the majority of litter items in the sea, the chapters of 
this book primarily focus on plastic litter and its implications for the marine envi-ronment. Numerous quantitative reports on marine anthropogenic litter from vari-ous parts of the world’s oceans indicate that anthropogenic litter is ubiquitous at the shores as well as in the pelagic and benthic realms. Global surveys revealed that plas-tics have already reached the shores of the remotest islands (Barnes 2005) and even polar waters far off urban centres (Barnes et al. 2010; Bergmann and Klages 2012). The use of advanced technology, such as remotely and autonomously operated vehi-cles, revealed that anthropogenic litter has conquered the deep sea before mankind set eye upon it suggesting that the deep seafloor may constitute the ultimate sink for marine litter (Pham et al. 2014). However, we are just beginning to understand how litter actually “behaves” at sea and to identify the drivers of the temporal and the spatial distribution of litter in the oceans. Still, we have already started to generate a mankind memory made out of plastic in the world ocean.
Marine anthropogenic litter causes harm to a wide range of marine biota. 
Seabirds, fish, turtles and marine mammals suffer from entanglement with and ingestion of marine litter items as illustrated by countless pictures of animals injured and strangled by discarded fishing gear in the public media. However, we have only limited knowledge about the implications of marine litter for the many less charismatic invertebrate species that easily escape public percep-tion but play important roles in marine ecosystems. Although already mentioned in the late 1980s (Ryan 1988), it took Thompson’s time series (Thompson et al. 2004) to raise public awareness of the widespread presence of microplastics, which are used in industrial production processes, cosmetics and toothpaste or generated through degradation of larger items. Indeed, substantial concentrations of microplastics were recently reported from remote and presumably unspoiled environments such as the deep seafloor (Woodall et al. 2014) and Arctic sea ice, which is considered a historic global sink at least until its plastic load is released into the ocean during the projected increase of ice melts (Obbard et al. 2014). Microplastics are available for ingestion by a wide range of organisms, and there are indications that microplastics are propagated over trophic levels of the marine food web (Farrell and Nelson 2013; Setälä et al. 2014). However, scientists have only recently started to investigate whether the contamination of marine organ-isms with plastics and associated chemicals is causing harm to ecosystems and human health (Browne et al. 2013; Bakir et al. 2014; De Witte et al. 2014; Van Cauwenberghe and Janssen 2014).Preface xi
The accumulation of litter at sea and along coastlines worldwide and the many 
open questions concerning the amount, distribution and fate of marine litter and 
potential implications for marine wildlife and humans have raised public awareness, stimulated scientific research and initiated political action to tackle this environmental problem (UNEP 2014). Identification, quantification and sampling of marine litter do not necessarily require professional scientific skills so that NGOs as well as commit-ted citizens and other stakeholders have contributed substantially to the collection of data on marine litter pollution and to the global perception of the problem (Rosevelt et al. 2013; Anderson and Alford 2014; Smith and Edgar 2014). Scientists, politicians, authorities, NGOs and industries have started to share knowledge at international conferences aimed at developing managerial solutions. These joint activities, public awareness and, finally, the scientific curiosity of numerous committed researchers have stimulated a rapidly increasing number of publications from various scientific disciplines in dedicated volumes (Coe and Rogers 1997; Thompson et al. 2009). This latest volume on Marine Anthropogenic Litter was inspired by the remarkable recent progress in marine litter research. A large proportion of the references reviewed in this book was published in the last three years demonstrating the topicality of this book and the issue as a whole. Because of the high dynamics in this field of research, this volume may already be outdated when published.
This book consists of five major sections. In the first section, Peter Ryan gives 
a historical synopsis of marine litter research starting from the first mention of floating debris in the famous novel 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne in 1870 but with a focus on the past 50 years, which have seen a strong increase in the production of plastics. The reader will learn about the rapid development of this research field, and a series of international key conferences such as the “Honolulu Conferences”, which brought together scientists, environmentalists, industry, NGOs and policy makers and fuelled numerous publications and new research and management schemes.
The second section of the book addresses abiotic aspects of marine litter pol-
lution. François Galgani, Georg Hanke and Thomas Maes portray the abundance, global distribution and composition of marine litter, which illustrates the ubiq-uity of litter in the oceans from the urban centres of human activity to the Earth’s remotest sites. Anthony L. Andrady describes the physical and chemical processes involved in the degradation of plastics in the marine environment.
The third section of the book covers the biological and ecological implications 
of marine litter. Susanne Kühn, Elisa L. Bravo Rebolledo and Jan A. van Franeker summarize the deleterious effects of litter on marine wildlife. The authors com-piled an extensive list of 580 species, ranging from invertebrates to fish, turtles, birds and mammals that have been shown to suffer from the effects of marine litter. Toxicity of contaminants associated with marine plastic debris as well as health implications is described by Chelsea Rochman who demonstrates that plas-tics are more than a mechanic threat to marine biota. Tim Kiessling, Lars Gutow and Martin Thiel show how marine litter facilitates the dispersal of marine organ-isms, which are capable of colonizing litter items floating at the sea surface. The authors compiled a list of 387 taxa that have been found rafting on floating litter, Preface xii
and they evaluate how marine litter might facilitate the spread of invasive species. 
This may alter the face of biodiversity with yet unknown consequences for ecosys-tem functioning.
The fourth section of this book is dedicated entirely to the young but rapidly 
expanding field of microplastic research. Since the recent rise in public awareness of microplastics in the marine environment, intensive research on this topic has yielded a considerable amount of important scientific results. Accordingly, this topic deserves an entire section, which is introduced by a synopsis of microplas-tic research by Richard C. Thompson. The various primary and secondary sources of microplastics and the pathways through the environment to the biota are out-lined by Mark A. Browne who also highlights the need for hypothesis-driven approaches in microplastic research. Because of the small size and the diversity of plastic polymers, the detection, proper identification and quantification of micro-plastics are challenging, which hampers the comparability of results from differ -
ent studies. Therefore, Martin G.J. Löder and Gunnar Gerdts composed a critical appraisal of methods and procedures applied in this field including a case study that demonstrates how improper methodology easily leads to a misevaluation of the contamination of habitats and organisms. The global distribution and the envi-ronmental effects of microplastics are summarized by Amy Lusher. She compiled a list of 172 taxa, which have been found to ingest microplastics either in the field (131) or in laboratory experiments (46) with variable effects on the behavior and health status of the organisms.
Although deleterious effects of microplastics have been demonstrated for a 
considerable number of marine organisms, the role of these particles as vectors for chemicals from the environment to the organisms is subject to intense debate. Albert A. Koelmans used a modeling approach to critically evaluate the transfer of environmental contaminants to marine organisms. Nanoparticles are of even smaller particle size (<1 µm). They are of particular concern as they are more likely to pass biological membranes and affect the functioning of cells including blood cells and photosynthesis. Albert A. Koelmans, Ellen Besseling and Won J. Shim summarize what little is known about this litter fraction, whose significance in the marine environment is just coming to light.
The final section of this book moves away from natural science towards the 
socio-economic implications of marine anthropogenic litter. Tamara S. Galloway reviews the current knowledge on how chemicals associated with plastics may affect human health. As top consumers of ocean-based food webs, humans likely accumulate contaminants, which may compromise fecundity, reproduction and other somatic processes. The accumulation of litter in the oceans can be consid-ered a result of market failure on land. The root of the problem is probably—as so often—that producers/manufacturers of goods (plastics) are not economically held responsible for the products they sell. Stephanie Newman, Emma Watkins, Andrew Farmer, Patrick ten Brink and Jean-Pierre Schweitzer describe economic instru-ments that were used in different parts of the world to reduce litter inputs to the sea. Although a number of international policies have been in place for quite some time to manage the input of litter to the sea, their shortcomings make them unlikely Preface xiii
to result in significant reductions of marine litter (Gold et al. 2013). Chung-Ling 
Chen describes and assesses key multilateral and national regulative measures with respect to their sufficiency to tackle marine litter pollution. Another way to reduce the input of litter to the ocean is suasion of citizens and stakeholders, which requires public awareness of the problem through education and outreach activities (Hartley et al. 2015). Ideally, such initiatives also generate data that can be used for assessments of marine litter pollution and distribution. In the last chapter, Valeria Hidalgo-Ruz and Martin Thiel review the potential of “citizen science” initiatives for supporting research on this global environmental issue.
The solution of the marine litter problem requires expertise from various sec-
tors, including industries, science, policy, authorities, NGOs and citizens. We hope that this book will facilitate the exchange of knowledge amongst the various actors and contribute to finding solutions to this challenge.

on microplastics and their role in the transfer of persistent organic pollutants to marine food webs. The reports in Science of large numbers of plastic pellets in the North Atlantic in the early 1970s stimulated research interest in plastic litter at sea, with papers reporting plastics on the seafloor and impacting a variety of marine animals. The focus then shifted to high concentrations of plastic litter in the North Pacific, where novel studies reported the dynamics of stranded beach litter, the factors influencing plastic ingestion by seabirds, and trends in fur seal entanglement. By the early 1980s, growing concern about the potential impacts of marine litter resulted in a series of meetings on marine debris. The first two international conferences held in Honolulu by the US National Marine Fisheries Service played a key role in setting the research agenda for the next decade. By the end of the 1980s, most impacts of marine litter were reasonably well under -
stood, and attention shifted to seeking effective solutions to tackle the marine litter problem. Research was largely restricted to monitoring trends in litter to assess the effectiveness of mitigation measures, until the last decade, when concern about microplastics coupled with the discovery of alarming densities of small plastic particles in the North Pacific ‘garbage patch’ (and other mid-ocean gyres) stimu-lated the current wave of research.

1.1  Introduction
From messages in bottles to exotic tropical seeds washing up on temperate shores 
(Guppy 1917; Muir 1937), the dispersal of floating debris at sea has long fasci-
nated people. As early as 1870 Jules Verne provided a graphic description of how floating debris accumulates in ocean gyres in the chapter on the Sargasso Sea in his famous novel Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea. However, this review focuses on the last 50 years because from the perspective of environmental impacts the history of marine litter research is closely linked to the development of plastics. Plastics are a diverse group of synthetic polymers that have their origins in the late 19th century, but which really came to the fore in the mid-twentieth century. Their low density, durability, excellent barrier properties and relatively low cost make plastics ideal materials for a wide range of manufacturing and packaging applications. Their versatility has seen the amount of plastic produced annually increase rapidly over the last few decades to an estimated 288 million tonnes in 2012 (Fig. 1.1), and this total continues to grow at about 4 % per year (PlasticsEurope 2013). However, the properties that make plastics so useful also 
make inappropriately handled waste plastics a significant environmental threat. Their durability means that they persist in the environment for many years, and their low density means that they are readily dispersed by water and wind, some-times travelling thousands of kilometres from source areas (Ryan et al. 2009). As a result, plastic wastes are now ubiquitous pollutants in even the most remote areas of the world (Barnes et al. 2009).
Over the last 60 years we have seen a major shift in perception surrounding 
the use of plastics, especially in one-off applications. Once seen as the savior of the American housewife (Life Magazine 1955), there are now calls to treat waste plastics as hazardous materials (Rochman et al. 2013a), reiterating a point first 
made by Bean (1987) that persistent plastic wastes qualify as hazardous wastes under the US Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Most of the threats posed by plastics occur at sea (Gregory 2009; Thompson et al. 2009), where waste plastics tend to accumulate (Barnes et al. 2009; Ryan et al. 2009). This chapter briefly summarises the history of marine litter research. Trends in the numbers of

papers on the marine litter problem (Fig. 1.2) show the growth in research from its 
infancy in the late 1960s, when it was still treated largely as a curiosity, through the 1970s and 1980s, when most of the threats to marine systems were identified, baseline data were collected on the distribution, abundance and impacts of marine litter, and policies were formulated to tackle the problem. Research tapered off in the 1990s, despite ongoing increases in the amounts of marine litter (Ryan and Moloney 1990, 1993), and it is only in the last decade or so that there has been a 
resurgence in research interest, following alarming reports of mid-ocean ‘garbage patches’ (Moore et al. 2001) and increasing appreciation of the pervasive nature of very small ‘microplastic’ particles (<0.5 mm) and their potential impacts on the health of marine ecosystems (Oehlmann et al. 2009; Thompson et al. 2009).
1.2  Seabirds and Seals—The First Signs of Trouble
Interactions between marine organisms and persistent litter were first recorded in the scientific literature in the late 1960s, when Kenyon and Kridler (1969) reported the ingestion of plastic items by Laysan Albatrosses (Phoebastria immutabilis) on the northwest Hawaiian Islands. They found plastic in the stomachs of 74 of 100 albatross chicks that died prior to fledging in 1966, with up to 8 items and an aver -
age of 2 g plastic per bird. However, this was an order of magnitude less than the average mass of pumice, seeds, charcoal and wood that the chicks also were fed 04080120160200

by their parents. Kenyon and Kridler (1969) inferred that these indigestible items 
were swallowed inadvertently at sea, because virtually all items floated in seawa-ter. They also speculated that the large size of many of the items might have con-tributed to the chicks’ deaths by blocking their digestive tracts.
In fact, there were earlier records of seabirds ingesting plastics, with plas-
tic found in stranded prions (Pachyptila spp.) in New Zealand as early as 1960 (Harper and Fowler 1987), and in Leach’s storm petrels (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) from Newfoundland, Canada, in 1962 (Rothstein 1973). Non-breeding Atlantic puffins (Fratercula arctica) collected from 1969 to 1971 were reported to contain elastic threads in their stomachs (Berland 1971; Parslow and Jefferies 1972). In some birds, these threads had formed tight balls up to 10 mm across, filling the gizzard and possibly partially blocking the pyloric valve leading into the intestine (Parslow and Jefferies 1972). Parslow and Jefferies (1972) noted that ingesting rubber and elastic was common among scavenging birds such as gulls, but that they regularly regurgitated such items along with other indigestible prey remains, implying that this was not a problem for such birds. And it was not just seabirds at risk. By the late 1950s there were records of marine turtles ingesting plastic bags, sometimes resulting in their deaths (Cornelius 1975; Balazs 1985). A mass of fishing line and other fishing gear blocked the intestine of a manatee (Trichechus manatus) in 1974 (Forrester et al. 1975), and stranded cetaceans were found to have eaten plastic by the mid-1970s (Cawthorn 1985).
Records of entanglement of marine organisms in plastic litter also started to 
increase in the 1960s. There were reports of birds and seals entangled in man-made items before this (e.g. Jacobson 1947), but they tended to remain in the gray litera-ture (Fowler 1985; Wallace 1985). By 1964 northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) 
were often reported entangled in netting and other artefacts in the Bering Sea, and the incidence of entangled seals harvested in the Pribilof Islands showed a steady increase from less than 0.2 % of the population in 1967 to a peak of over 0.7 % in 1975 (Fowler 1987). The entanglement rate then stabilized at around 0.4 % through the late 1970s and early 1980s (Fig. 1.3), but this was still sufficient to help to drive 
a population decrease in this species (Fowler 1987; Fowler et al. 1990). By com-
parison, entanglement rates of three seal species at the Farallon Islands off central California showed a marked increase in the early 1980s (Hanni and Pyle 2000).

Entanglement of fish and dogfish in rubber bands was reported in 1971 (Anon 
1971; Berland 1971), and Gochfeld (1973) highlighted the entanglement threat 
posed by marine litter to coastal birds. Based on observations on Long Island in 1970 and 1971, Gochfeld (1973) reported how adult and chick black skimmers (Rhynchops niger) and two species of terns died after being entangled in nylon fishing line, kite strings, six-pack holders, bags and bottles. Although the numbers of birds affected were not great, Gochfeld (1973) argued that they might be suf-ficient to cause at least some populations to decrease, especially when combined with other human impacts in the region. Subsequently, Bourne (1976, 1977) sum-
marised what was known about the threat posed by plastic ingestion and entangle-ment to seabirds, and reported how the incorporation of rope and netting in seabird nests can entangle and kill seabird chicks. He also highlighted the threat posed by the switch to manufacturing nets and other fishing gear from persistent polymers, including ghost fishing by lost or discarded gear (Bourne 1977). Entanglement was a significant cause of mortality for northern gannets (Morus bassanus), affecting roughly a quarter of birds found dead in the North Sea in the 1980s (Schrey and Vauk 1987), and remains a problem for this species today (Rodríguez 
et al. 2013).
1.3  The Early 1970s—Pellets and Other Problems  
in the North Atlantic
Many of these early records of ingestion and entanglement only came to light after 
two seminal papers on the occurrence of plastic particles at sea in the northwest Atlantic Ocean appeared in the leading journal Science in 1972. In the first paper, Carpenter and Smith (1972) reported the presence of plastic pellets and fragments in all 11 surface net samples collected in the western Sargasso Sea in late 1971, at an average density of around 3500 particles km
−2 (290 g km−2). Interestingly, 
the density of plastic was lowest towards the edge of the Sargasso Sea, where it bordered the Gulf Stream, suggesting that these particles had been accumulating in the North Atlantic gyre for some time (cf. Law et al. 2010; Lebreton et al. 2012; Maximenko et al. 2012). Carpenter and Smith (1972) noted that the plastic parti-cles provided attachment sites for epibionts, including hydroids and diatoms, and speculated that such particles could become a significant problem if plastic pro-duction continued to increase. They also suggested that plastic particles could be a source of toxic compounds such as plasticisers and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) into marine food webs.
In the second paper, Carpenter et al. (1972) reported high densities of poly-
styrene pellets in coastal waters off southern New England, east of Long Island (average 0.0–2.6 pellets m
−3, exceptionally reaching 14 pellets m−3). Polystyrene 
is denser than seawater, so the pellets were not expected to disperse far from source areas, but some contained air-filled vacuoles, allowing them to float. The pellets supported communities of bacteria, and were found to have absorbed 6 P.G. Ryan
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from seawater. Pellets were recorded in the 
stomachs of eight of 14 fish species and one chaetognath (Sagitta elegans) sam-pled in the area. The fish ignored translucent pellets, only eating opaque white pellets, which suggested selective feeding on the more visible pellets. With up to 33 % of individuals of some fish species affected, Carpenter et al. (1972) raised concerns about the possible impacts due to intestinal blockage of smaller individu-als as well as pellets being a source of PCBs.
In fact, Carpenter’s two Science papers were not the first papers to describe 
small pieces of plastic litter at sea. Buchanan (1971) reported densities of up to 10
5 synthetic fibres m−3 in water samples from the North Sea, and larger frag-
ments were reported to occur in “embarrassing proportions” in plankton samples. And although Heyerdahl (1971) mainly concentrated on oil and tar pollution, he reported sightings of plastic containers throughout the second Ra expedition across 
the North Atlantic. However, Carpenter’s papers focused scientific attention on the ubiquitous nature of small plastic particle pollution at sea, and identified three pos-sible impacts: intestinal blockage and a source of toxic compounds from ingested plastic, and the transport of epibionts.
Following Carpenter et al. (1972), large numbers of polystyrene pellets were 
reported from coastal waters in the United Kingdom (Kartar et al. 1973, 1976; 
Morris and Hamilton 1974) where they were ingested by three species of fish and a marine snailfish (Liparis liparis). More than 20 % of juvenile flounder (Platichthys flesus) contained ingested plastics, with up to 30 pellets in some individuals. Hays and Cormons (1974) found polystyrene pellets in gull and tern regurgitations col-lected on Long Island, New York, in 1971. Although the gulls may have consumed the plastic pellets directly while scavenging, their presence in the diet of terns almost certainly indicated that they were consumed in contaminated fish prey, pro-viding the first evidence of trophic transfers of small plastic items. Sampling close to wastewater outfalls confirmed that the pellets came from plastic manufactur -
ing plants (Hays and Cormons 1974). Fortunately, these point sources were fairly easy to identify and address. By 1975 the incidence of plastic ingestion by fish and snails in the UK’s Severn Estuary had fallen to zero, indicating that the release of polystyrene pellets had virtually ceased from the manufacturing plants (Kartar et al. 1976). However, spillage of pellets by converters and during transport proved 
more difficult to contain.
Carpenter’s two Science papers in 1972 stimulated a broader interest in marine 
litter and its impacts. Colton et al. (1974) reported a much more extensive sur -
vey of floating plastics in the North Atlantic and Caribbean. They showed that both industrial pellets and fragments of manufactured items occurred throughout the region, but were concentrated close to major land-based sources along the US eastern seaboard. Unlike Carpenter et al. (1972), they failed to find any plastics in fish sampled. Feeding trials with polystyrene pellets showed that juvenile fish seldom ingested plastics, and those pellets that were ingested seemingly passed through the fish with little impact.
Beach litter also came under increased scrutiny. Scott (1972) debunked the 
notion that beach users were responsible for most litter. He examined the litter 7 1 A Brief History of Marine Litter Research
found on inaccessible Scottish beaches that have few if any visitors, and inferred 
that most litter came from shipping and fisheries operating in the area. Initial stud-ies of beach litter simply assessed standing stocks (Ryan et al. 2009); Cundell (1973) was the first researcher to report the rate of plastic accumulation. Working 
on a beach in Narragansett Bay, USA, he assessed the amount of litter washing ashore over one month. The first study of beach litter dynamics was conducted in Kent, United Kingdom, from 1973 to 1976. Dixon and Cooke (1977) showed that the weekly retention rate of marked bottles and other containers varied depend-ing on the type of beach, and that plastic bottles remained on beaches longer than glass bottles. Strong tidal currents resulted in low retention rates (11–29 % per week) and transported litter throughout the southern North Sea. Some marked bot-tles travelled >100 km in one week, and others reached Germany and Denmark within 3–6 weeks. Dixon and Cooke (1977) also used manufacturer’s codes to assess the longevity of containers and found that few (<20 %) were manufactured 
more than two years prior to stranding.
In addition to the growing awareness of plastic litter at the sea surface and 
stranded on beaches, the mid-1970s also saw the first records of plastics on the seabed. Holmström (1975) reported how Swedish fishermen “almost invariably” caught plastic sheets in their trawl nets when fishing in the Skagerrak. Subsequent analysis showed this to be low-density polyethylene, similar to that used for pack-aging. The samples, obtained from the seabed 180–400 m deep, were encrusted with a calcareous bryozoan and a brown alga (Lithoderma sp.). Holmström (1975) surmised that these encrusting biota had increased the density of the plastic sheets sufficiently to cause them to sink to the seabed. The bryozoan and brown alga typically occur in water <25 m deep, and the size of bryozoan colonies suggested that the plastic sheets had spent 3–4 months drifting in the euphotic zone close to the sea surface before sinking to the seabed. Subsequent trials confirmed that most plastics sink due to fouling (Ye and Andrady 1991), and trawl surveys and direct observations have confirmed that plastics and other persistent artefacts now occur on the seabed throughout the world’s oceans (Barnes et al. 2009). Indeed, Goldberg (1994, 1997) suggested that the seabed is the ultimate sink for plastics 
in the environment, and plastic items typically comprise >70 % of seabed arte-facts (Galgani et al. 2000). The Mediterranean Sea supports particularly high densities of litter on the seafloor, locally exceeding 100,000 items km
−2, and has 
been the subject of numerous studies to ascertain the factors determining the dis-tribution and abundance of this litter (e.g. Bingel et al. 1987; Galil et al. 1995; Galgani et al. 1995, 1996). Interestingly, although benthic litter tends to concen-
trate around coastal cities and river mouths, the density of litter is often greater in deep waters along the continental shelf edge than in shallow, inshore waters due to the decrease in bottom currents offshore (Galgani et al. 1995, 2000; Barnes et al. 
2009; Keller et al. 2010).
Winston (1982) elaborated on Carpenter and Smith’s (1972) suggestion that 
plastic debris greatly increased settlement opportunities for organisms that live on objects floating at the sea surface. In particular, the bryozoan Electra tenella appeared to have extended its range and greatly increased in abundance in the 8 P.G. Ryan
western Atlantic Ocean. Subsequent research has highlighted the potential threat 
posed by drifting litter transporting organisms outside their native ranges (Barnes 2002; Barnes and Milner 2005; Gregory 2009). This is a serious problem, espe-cially in remote regions, and can result in the transfer of potentially harmful organisms (Masó et al. 2003). However, it probably pales into insignificance in most regions compared to the transport by shipping and other human-mediated vectors (Bax et al. 2003), which in extreme cases can transfer entire communities across ocean basins (Wanless et al. 2010).
1.4  Shifting Focus to the North Pacific Ocean
Indications that the North Pacific was a hot spot for plastic litter date back to 
Kenyon and Kridler’s (1969) paper on plastic ingestion by Laysan  albatross. 
Subsequently, Bond (1971) found plastic pellets in all 20 red phalaropes (Phalaropus fulicarius) examined when many individuals of this species came ashore along the coasts of southern California and Mexico in 1969. The birds apparently starved due to a shortage of surface plankton, and some were observed feeding along the strand line where plastic pellets were abundant (Bond 1971). It was unclear whether this had contributed to the high incidence of plastic in these birds, but Connors and Smith (1982) found plastic in six of seven red  phalaropes 
killed by colliding with powerlines on their northward migration in central California. Birds with large volumes of ingested plastic had smaller fat reserves, raising concerns that ingested plastic reduced digestive efficiency or meal size.
Baltz and Morejohn (1976) reported plastic in nine species of seabirds stranded 
in Monterey Bay, central California, during 1974–1975. All individuals of two species contained plastic: northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) and short-tailed shearwater (Puffinus tenuirostris). Industrial pellets predominated in these birds, but they were also found to contain pieces of food wrap, foamed polystyrene, synthetic sponge and pieces of rigid plastic. Baltz and Morejohn (1976) specu-lated that having large volumes of plastic in their stomachs could interfere with the birds’ digestion, although they considered that toxic chemicals adsorbed to the plastics posed the greatest threat to bird health. Ohlendorf et al. (1978) showed that plastic ingestion also occurred among Alaskan seabirds.
In the same year that Colton et al. (1974) showed the ubiquitous nature of 
plastic particles floating in the northwest Atlantic, Wong et al. (1974) reported that plastic pellets were widespread in the North Pacific Ocean. Sampling in 1972, they found that pellets occurred at lower densities (average 300 g km
−2) 
than tar balls, but they outnumbered tar balls northeast of Hawaii, with up to 34,000 pellets km
−2 (3500 g km−2). Even before this, however, Venrick et al. 
(1973) had shown that large litter items, at least half of which were made of plastic, were commonly encountered in the North Pacific gyre northeast of Hawaii (roughly 4.2 items km
−2) in the area of the now notorious ‘North Pacific 
Garbage Patch’. This is where Moore et al. (2001) recorded densities of more than 9 1 A Brief History of Marine Litter Research
300,000 particles km−2 in 1999, and where the weight of the plastic was six times 
that of the associated zooplankton.
Merrell (1980) conducted one of the first detailed studies of beach litter. Working 
on remote Alaskan beaches, he reported how the amount of plastic litter more than 
doubled in abundance between 1972 and 1974, increasing from an average density of 122 to 345 kg km
−1. Most of this litter came from fisheries operating in the area, 
but some apparently had drifted more than 1500 km from Asia. At the same time, Jewett (1976) and Feder et al. (1978) found that litter was common on the seabed off Alaska, with plastic items predominating. Merrell (1980) considered that the most obvious impact of beach litter was its aesthetic impact. In terms of biological threats, he speculated that plastic litter might account for the elevated levels of PCBs recorded in rats and intertidal organisms on Amchitka Island, and also suggested that plastics might be a source of phthalates and other toxic compounds into marine sys-tems. Litter also entangled animals, especially seals and seabirds (Merrell 1980), and even terrestrial species were not immune from this problem (Beach et al. 1976).
Merrell (1980) reported the first long-term study of litter accumulation from a 
1-km beach on Amchitka Island, Aleutians. He showed that the accumulation rate of litter (average 0.9 kg km
−1 d−1) varied considerably between sample periods 
(0.6–2.3 kg km−1 d−1), and at a fine temporal scale the amount of litter stranded 
was a function of recent weather conditions. He also estimated the annual turnover rate of plastic items on the beach by marking gillnet floats, the most abundant lit-ter item on the island, in two successive years. During the intervening year, 41 % of marked floats disappeared (25 % at one beach and 70 % at another beach), but this loss was more than compensated for by new arrivals, with a net increase of 130 %. Merrell (1980) discussed the various factors causing the loss of plastic items from beaches (burial, export inland or out to sea, etc.), and noted the bias introduced by selective beachcombing. Even on remote Amchitka Island, the small Atomic Energy Commission workforce removed certain types of fishing floats within a few days of the floats washing ashore.
The large amounts of litter found in Alaska, coupled with ingestion by seabirds 
(Ohlendorf et al. 1978) and entanglement of seals (Fowler 1985, 1987), stimulated 
the first post-graduate thesis on the marine litter problem. Bob Day (1980) stud-ied the amounts of plastic ingested by Alaskan seabirds, in the first community-level study of plastic ingestion. Of the almost 2000 birds from 37 species collected off Alaska from 1969 to 1977, plastic was found in 40 % of species and 23 % of individuals. His main findings were presented in a review paper at the first marine debris conference in 1984 that summarized what was known about plastic inges-tion by birds (Day et al. 1985). By that stage, it was clear that the incidence of plastic ingestion varied greatly among taxa, with high rates typically recorded among petrels and shearwaters (Procellariidae), phalaropes (Phalaropus) and some auks (Alcidae). Unsurprisingly, generalist foragers that fed near the water surface tended to have the highest plastic loads, although some pursuit-diving shearwaters and auks also contained large amounts of plastic. Plastic items were only found in the stomachs of birds; no visible items passed into the intestines. There was some evidence that at least some species retained plastic particles in 10 P.G. Ryan
their stomachs for considerable periods (up to 15 months), where they slowly 
eroded. Almost all particles floated in seawater, and comparison of the colors of ingested plastics with observations of the colors of litter items at sea demonstrated that all species favoured more conspicuous items, suggesting they were consumed deliberately. Industrial pellets comprised the majority of plastic items in most spe-cies sampled, possibly due to their similarity to fish eggs.
Day et al. (1985) also showed that the incidence of plastic ingestion generally 
increased over the study period, but patterns were affected by seasonal and age-related differences in plastic loads. Sex had no effect on plastic loads, but imma-ture birds contained more plastic than adults in two of three species where this could be tested. There were also regional differences in plastic loads, with birds from the Aleutian Islands containing more plastic than birds from the Gulf of Alaska, and even lower loads in birds from the Bering and Chukchi Seas. Surveys in the North Atlantic confirmed regional differences in plastic loads in northern fulmars (Bourne 1976; Furness 1985a; van Franeker 1985), paving the way for the use of this species to monitor the abundance and distribution of plastic litter at sea (Ryan et al. 2009; van Franeker et al. 2011; Kühn and van Franeker 2012).
Like Connors and Smith (1982), Day (1980) found weak negative correla-
tions between the amount of ingested plastic and body mass or fat reserves in some species, suggesting a sub-lethal effect on birds. And among parakeet auklets (Cyclorrhynchus psittacula), non-breeding adults contained twice as much plastic as breeding adults. However, Day (1980) was quick to point out that the differ -
ences in plastic loads could be a consequence of poor body condition or breeding status rather than vice versa. Harper and Fowler (1987) assumed that the nega-tive correlation between the amount of ingested plastic and body mass of juve-nile Salvin’s prions (Pachyptila salvini) stranded in New Zealand in 1966 resulted from starving birds resorting to eat inedible objects such as pumice and plastic pellets. Spear et al. (1995) reported that among a large series of birds collected in the tropical Pacific, heavier birds were more likely to contain plastic, and attrib-uted this to the fact that they fed in productive frontal areas where plastic tends to accumulate (cf. Bourne and Clarke 1984). Among birds that contained plastic, there was a negative correlation between the amount of plastic and body weight, which they interpreted as providing the first solid evidence of a negative relation-ship between plastic ingestion and body condition (Spear et al. 1995). However, 
caution must be exercised in such comparisons, given the effects of age and breed-ing status on the amounts of plastic in seabirds such as petrels that regurgitate accumulated plastic to their chicks (Ryan 1988a).
1.5  Into the Southern Hemisphere
Despite the fact that the first record of plastic ingestion came from the Southern Hemisphere in 1960 (Harper and Fowler 1987), reports of the occurrence of plas-tics at sea in the Southern Hemisphere generally lagged somewhat behind that 11 1 A Brief History of Marine Litter Research
in the north. Notable exceptions were the reports of plastic ingestion by turtles 
in South Africa, where plastic pellets were found in juvenile loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) in 1968 (Hughes 1970) and a large sheet of plastic was found blocking the intestine of a leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) that died in 1970 (Hughes 1974). The paucity of records of plastic litter from the Southern Hemisphere did not mean that the problem was not as severe in the less indus-trialized south. Gregory (1977, 1978) reported plastic pellets from virtually all 
New Zealand beaches, with densities at some beaches estimated at >100,000 pel-lets m
−1, which probably are the highest estimates of industrial pellet densities 
from any beach. Quite why such high densities were found in a country with a relatively small manufacturing base is unclear. Plastic pellets were also recorded in oceanic waters of the South Atlantic off the Cape in 1979, an area far removed from major shipping lanes and with little industrial activity in adjacent coastal regions (Morris 1980). There was a suggestion that pellets were more abundant 
west of 12°E (1500–3600 km
−2) than closer to the Cape coast (0–2000 km−2), 
possibly linked to their aggregation in the South Atlantic gyre (cf. Lebreton et al. 2012; Maximenko et al. 2012; Ryan 2014). However, the average density of pel-lets and other plastic fragments close to the Cape coast was more than 3600 par -
ticles km
−2 (Ryan 1988b), similar to densities reported in oceanic waters of the 
North Atlantic (Carpenter and Smith 1972; Colton et al. 1974) and North Pacific (Wong et al. 1974). By comparison, the density of pellets and other plastic litter in sub-Antarctic waters south of New Zealand was very low (<100 items km
−2, 
Gregory et al. 1984).
In addition to plastic pellet ingestion by New Zealand prions since the 1960s  
(Harper and Fowler 1987), rubber bands were found in Antarctic fulmars (Fulmarus glacialoides) stranded on New Zealand beaches in 1975 (Crockett and Reed 1976), and during an irruption of Southern Ocean petrels to New Zealand 
in 1981 all blue petrels (Halobaena caerulea) but very few Kerguelen petrels (Lugensa brevirostris) contained plastic (Reed 1981). Subsequent studies con-
firmed the high levels of plastic in blue petrels, despite the species rarely forag-ing north of the Subtropical Convergence (Ryan 1987a). Sampling in 1981 also 
showed that at least three petrel species collected in the South Atlantic Ocean contained plastics (Bourne and Imber 1982; Furness 1983; Randall et al. 1983). 
The incidence was greatest in great shearwaters (Puffinus gravis), with 90 % of individuals of this trans-equatorial migrant containing plastic particles, sometimes 
in large volumes (up to 78 pellets and fragments; Furness 1983). Further surveys 
even found plastics in Antarctic seabirds, but they were scarce in species that remained south of the Antarctic Polar Front year round compared to migrants that ventured farther north in the non-breeding season (Ryan 1987a; van Franeker and Bell 1988). Beach litter surveys confirmed the presence of plastic wastes in the far 
south, although the amounts of litter decreased from south temperate to sub-Ant-arctic and Antarctic locations (Gregory et al. 1984; Gregory 1987; Ryan 1987b).
Bob Furness (1985b) reported the first systematic survey of plastic ingestion 
by Southern Hemisphere birds for the seabirds of Gough Island, central South Atlantic Ocean. Of the 15 species sampled, 10 contained plastic, and two species 12 P.G. Ryan
had plastic in more than 80 % of individuals sampled. Petrels were again the most 
affected species, and Furness (1985b) was able to show that this was linked to the structure of their stomachs. The angled constriction between the fore-stomach and gizzard apparently prevents petrels regurgitating indigestible prey remains (except when feeding their chicks). Once again body mass was inversely corre-lated with the amount of ingested plastic in some species, but Furness (1985b) highlighted the need for controlled experiments to demonstrate an adverse impact of plastic ingestion. Building on this study, Ryan (1987a) showed that 40 of 60 Southern Hemisphere seabird species ingested plastic. Controlling for age and breeding status there was no correlation between plastic load and body condition (Ryan 1987c), but there was a correlation with PCB concentrations (Ryan et al. 
1988), and chicks experimentally fed plastic grew more slowly than control birds, because they ate smaller meals (Ryan 1988c). A subsequent experiment showed that marine turtle hatchlings did not increase their food intake sufficiently to offset dietary dilution by an inert substance used to mimic the presence of plastic in their diet (McCauley and Bjorndal 1999).
Although most plastic apparently was ingested directly by the marine ver -
tebrates studied, there was some evidence of secondary ingestion. Eriksson and Burton (2003) collected plastic particles from fur seal scat on Macquarie Island and speculated that they were ingested by lantern fish (Electrona subaspera), which were then eaten by the seals. And ingestion was not the only issue reported from the Southern Hemisphere. During the 1970s the rates of entanglement of Cape fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus) in southern Africa (Shaughnessy 1980) were similar to those of northern fur seals in Alaska. The first entangled New Zealand fur seal (Arctocephalus forsteri) was observed in 1975 (Cawthorn 1985), and by the late 1970s entanglements of fur seals were recorded as far south as South Georgia (Bonner and McCann 1982). The first entanglements of cetaceans and sharks also were recorded from New Zealand in the 1970s (Cawthorn 1985).
1.6  Aloha—The Marine Debris Conferences
The growing awareness of the accumulation of plastic wastes in marine systems, and their impacts on marine biota, resulted in the Marine Mammal Commission approaching the US National Marine Fisheries Service in 1982 to arrange a work-shop on the issue. Given the severity of the problem in the North Pacific Ocean, the task devolved to the Southwest Fisheries Center’s Honolulu Laboratory. The Workshop on the Fate and Impact of Marine Debris took place in late November 1984 and was attended by 125 people from eight countries (91 % from the USA, 
4 % from Asia, 3 % from Europe and 1 % each from Canada and New Zealand). 
Given the geographic bias of delegates, most of the 31 papers dealt with the North Pacific, but there were more general papers on the distribution and dynamics of floating litter as well as reviews of entanglement (Wallace 1985), and ingestion by seabirds (Day et al. 1985). The 580-page proceedings, edited by Richard Shomura 13 1 A Brief History of Marine Litter Research
and Howard Yoshida, appeared laudably fast as a NOAA Technical Memorandum 
in July 1985. Papers presented at the workshop were divided into three themes: the origins and amounts of marine debris (12 papers), impacts on marine resources (13 papers), and its fate (4 papers). The proceedings concluded with summary documents from working groups addressing each of the three main themes. The workshop emphasized the need to raise awareness of the threat posed by marine litter, and recommended three mitigation initiatives: to regulate the disposal of high-risk plastic items, to promote recycling of fishing nets, and to investigate the use of biodegradable material in fishing gear.
The success of the first marine debris workshop led to plans for a Second 
International Conference on Marine Debris. However, before this could occur the Sixth International Ocean Disposal Symposium took place in Pacific Grove, California, in April 1986. This was the first symposium in this series to address the dumping of persistent plastic wastes (Wolfe 1987). It was attended by 160 delegates from 10 countries and resulted in a special issue of Marine Pollution Bulletin (1987, volume 18, issue 6B). The focus was largely on ship-based sources of marine debris and their impacts, but also addressed incidental bycatch in fishing gear as well as land-based sources of debris. A few papers were repeated from the 1984 Honolulu workshop, and apart from Pruter’s (1987) review of litter sources and amounts and Laist’s (1987) review of the biological impacts of marine plas-tics, two of the most important papers dealt with legal approaches and strategies to reduce the amount of plastic entering the sea (Bean 1987; Lentz 1987).
The Second International Conference on Marine Debris was again held in 
Honolulu in April 1989, attracting over 170 delegates from 10 countries (USA 83 %, Japan 6 %, Canada and New Zealand 3 % each, UK 2 %; all other coun-tries <1 %). It had a more ambitious scope than the first conference, with seven themed sessions following a series of regional overview papers. Whereas the focus of the first meeting was largely on the amounts and impacts of debris, the second conference concentrated more on tackling the problem, with sessions on solutions through technology, law and policy, and education, as well as the first estimates of the economic costs of marine litter. The two-volume, 1274-page proceedings, edited by Richard Shomura and Mary Lynne Godfrey, was again published as a NOAA Technical Memorandum in December 1990 and contained 76 papers plus eight working group reports. The proceedings made numerous recommendations, including nine priority recommendations. Both the first and second conference proceedings are available as internet downloads.
The first two Marine Debris Conferences played a major role in collating 
information on the marine debris issue. The large numbers of papers in the two proceedings resulted in a spike in publications on the subject (Fig. 1.2). Three further conferences have taken place. The Third International Conference on Marine Debris was held in Miami in May 1994 and had a more Caribbean flavor. It also differed from the two earlier conferences in having only selected papers published from the meeting in a book that aimed to provide a definitive treatment of the marine debris problem (Coe and Rogers 1997). The theme of the confer -
ence was ‘Seeking Global Solutions’, and two-thirds of the papers were devoted 14 P.G. Ryan
to mitigation, with four chapters on the socioeconomics of marine litter, eight 
chapters addressing at-sea sources, and ten chapters on land-based sources. This reflected the increasing appreciation that not only were diffuse, land-based inputs the major source of marine litter, but that in many ways they were harder to tackle than ship-based sources.
The two most recent Marine Debris Conferences were again held in Honolulu. 
The fourth conference (August 2000), which focused on the problems posed by derelict fishing gear, attracted 235 people from more than 20 countries, all but one in the Pacific region. The fifth meeting (March 2011) was the largest yet, with more than 450 delegates from across the world, reflecting the mounting concern among civil society regarding the threats posed by marine litter. Entitled ‘Waves of Change: Global Lessons to Inspire Local Action’, the conference concluded that despite the challenges inherent in tackling marine debris, the problem is pre-ventable. The summary proceedings, released on the internet after the meeting, included reports from the three working groups established to address the preven-tion, reduction and management of land-based sources, of at-sea sources, and the removal and processing of accumulated marine debris. The reports highlighted progress made in each of these areas over the last decade, identified remain-ing challenges, and made recommendations for future action. The conference concluded with the Honolulu Commitment, which called on governmental and non-governmental organisations, industry and other stakeholders to commit to 12 action points, including formulating the Honolulu Strategy to prevent, reduce and manage marine debris. This framework document, sponsored by United Nations Environment Programme and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, was released in 2012.
1.7  Mitigation Measures and Long-Term  
Changes in Marine Litter
One of the major challenges in addressing the marine plastics problem is the 
diverse nature of plastic products, and the many routes they can follow to enter marine systems (Pruter 1987; Ryan et al. 2009). As a result, a diversity of mit-igation measures is needed to tackle the problem. Initial efforts focused on two specific user groups, shipping/fisheries and the plastics industry, at least in part because they are relatively discrete user groups, and thus are more eas-ily addressed (at least in theory). Shipping was a major source of marine litter (Scott 1972; Horsman 1982). Dumping persistent plastic wastes from land-based 
sources at sea was banned under the Convention on the Prevention of Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (London Dumping Convention, promulgated in 1972; Lentz 1987), but operational wastes generated by vessels were exempt until Annex V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL, promulagated in 1973) came into force at the end of 1988 (www.imo.org). Since then considerable effort has been expended to ensure there 15 1 A Brief History of Marine Litter Research
are adequate port facilities to receive wastes from ships (Coe and Rogers 1997). 
Current signatories to MARPOL Annex V are responsible for more than 97 % of 
the world’s shipping tonnage, but compliance and enforcement remain significant problems (Carpenter and MacGill 2005).
Industrial pellets were another target for early mitigation measures because 
they were abundant in the environment, often ingested by marine birds and tur -
tles, and only handled by a relatively small group of manufacturers and convert-ers. As early as the 1970s it was clear that improving controls in manufacturing plants could significantly reduce the numbers of pellets entering coastal waters (Kartar et al. 1976). The loss of pellets in wastewater should fall under national water quality control measures, but in most countries the issue has been ignored in favour of chemical pollutants (Bean 1987). As a result, it was left to the plastics industry to initiate efforts to reduce losses of industrial pellets such as Operation Clean Sweep, established in the USA in 1992, and adopted in various guises by many other plastics industry organisations around the world (Redford et al. 1997).
How effective were these measures in reducing litter entering the sea? Although 
there were some exceptions (e.g. Merrell 1984), amounts of plastic litter at sea 
increased up to the 1990s, and then appeared to stabilize, whereas quantities on beaches and on the seabed have continued to increase (Barnes et al. 2009; Law et al. 2010). This could result from a decrease in the amounts of litter entering 
the sea (Barnes et al. 2009), but interpretation is complicated by the difficulty of monitoring marine litter loads, and our rather poor understanding of the rates of degradation and transport between habitats and regions (Ryan et al. 2009). Part of the problem is that mitigation measures may be effective in reducing the propor -
tion of the waste stream reaching the sea, but this decrease may be insufficient to decrease the absolute amount of litter entering the sea, given the ongoing increase in plastic production (Fig. 1.1).
Interaction rates with marine biota provide one way to track the impacts 
of marine litter, and several studies have focused on the effects of specific miti-gation initiatives. For example, the rate of entanglement in Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) at South Georgia decreased over the last two decades fol-
lowing active steps to prevent dumping of persistent wastes by vessels operating in the waters around the island. However, some of the decrease can be attributed to changes in seal numbers (Arnould and Croxall 1995; Waluda and Staniland 2013). A similar conclusion was reached by Boren et al. (2006) for New Zealand fur seals, where the decrease in the entanglement rate after 1997 was more likely a result of increasing seal numbers than a decrease in the amounts of litter at sea. Henderson (2001) showed no change in entanglement rates of Hawaiian monk seals (Monachus 
schauinslandi) before and after the implementation of MARPOL Annex V , nor was there a decrease in the rate at which netting washed ashore at the northwest Hawaiian Islands. Page et al. (2004) also showed no change in seal entanglement rates in southeast Australia despite efforts by government and fishing organisa-tions to reduce the amount of litter discarded at sea. However, beach surveys in this region suggested that the implementation of MARPOL Annex V reduced the amounts of litter washed ashore (Edyvane et al. 2004). Ribic et al. (2010)  16 P.G. Ryan
showed how carefully designed beach litter surveys can detect regional differences 
in long-term trends in the amounts of stranded litter, with consistent trends in land- and ship-based sources of litter.
Long-term studies of plastic ingestion by seabirds also indicate limited suc-
cess in tackling the marine litter problem. The rapid increase in the amount of ingested plastic through the 1960s and 1970s (Harper and Fowler 1987; Moser and Lee 1992) stabilized during the 1980s and 1990s (Vlietstra and Parga 2002; Ryan 
2008; Bond et al. 2013), but only studies of North Atlantic fulmars show a recent decrease in the amount of ingested plastic (van Franeker et al. 2011). Although 
the total amount of ingested plastic has tended to remain fairly constant over the last few decades, there has been a marked change in the composition of ingested plastic from pellets to plastic fragments (Vlietstra and Parga 2002; Ryan 2008; van Franeker et al. 2011), suggesting that efforts to reduce the numbers of pel-lets entering the sea have been at least partly successful. These results mirror the findings of net-samples of plastic litter at sea, which have seen a major increase in the proportion of user fragments and a corresponding decrease in industrial pel-lets relative to surveys conducted in the 1970s and 1980s (Moore et al. 2001; Law et al. 2010).
1.8  Plastic Degradation and the Microplastic Boom
Although many plastics are remarkably persistent, they are not immune to deg-radation. Indeed the plastics industry goes to considerable effort to slow the rate of degradation in many applications (Andrady et al. 2003). Ultraviolet (UV) radi-ation plays a key role in plastic degradation, and because UV light is absorbed rapidly by water, plastics generally take much longer to degrade at sea than on land (Andrady 2003). However, the rate of degradation depends on the ambient temperature as well as polymer type, additives and fillers (Andrady et al. 2003). Carpenter and Smith (1972) observed some degradation in polyethylene pellets collected at sea, but Gregory (1987) inferred degradation occurred more rapidly in stranded plastics, where they were exposed to high levels of UV radiation. The proportion of degraded pellets increased higher up the beach, away from the most recent strandline (Gregory 1987). Little is known about the fate of plastic that sinks to the seafloor; it is widely assumed that plastic is largely impervious to degradation once shielded from UV radiation (Goldberg 1997). However, there is 
some evidence that plastic fragments may be susceptible to bacterial decay at sea (Harshvardhan and Jha 2013; Zettler et al. 2013).
At the same time that plastics were being recognized as a significant marine pol-
lutant, it was recognized that plastic litter was broken down by photodegradation and oxidation (Scott 1972; Cundell 1974). Scott (1972) reported how some beach litter items became embrittled and were reduced to small particles by very slight pressure. The apparent lack of disintegrated plastic around such items led him to conclude that the particles “had clearly been absorbed rapidly by the environment” 17 1 A Brief History of Marine Litter Research
(Scott 1972, p. 36). Gregory (1983) also assumed that this process led to “complete 
degradation of the plastic pellets and dispersal as dust” (p. 82). However, it was a 
case of out of sight, out of mind. Thompson et al. (2004) showed that microscopic plastic fragments and fibres are ubiquitous marine pollutants. Together with the high media profile given the Pacific ‘garbage patch’ (Moore et al. 2001) and simi-lar litter aggregations in other mid-ocean gyres (e.g. Law et al. 2010; Eriksen et al. 2013a), the research by Thompson et al. (2004) was largely responsible for the recent resurgence in interest in the marine litter problem (Fig. 1.2). Like larger plas-
tic items, ‘microplastics’ (Ryan and Moloney 1990) are now found throughout the 
world’s oceans, including in deep-sea sediments (van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013).
There is ongoing debate as to the size limit for ‘microplastics’ (Thompson 
2015). Some authors take a broad view, including items <5 mm diameter (Arthur et al. 2009), whereas others restrict the term to items <2 mm, <1 mm 
or even <500 μm (Cole et al. 2011). Andrady (2011) argued the need for three terms: mesoplastics (500 μm–5 mm), microplastics (50–500 μm) and nanoplas-tics (<50 μm), each with their own set of physical characteristics and biological impacts. Depending on the upper size limit, industrial pellets may or may not be included in the term. But even if we adopt a narrow view, not all microplastics derive from degradation of larger plastic items. Some cosmetics, hand cleaners and air blast cleaning media contain small (<500 μm) plastic beads manufactured specifically for this purpose (Zitko and Hanlon 1991; Gregory 1996), the so-called primary microplastics (Cole et al. 2011). The proportion of primary microplastics in the environment probably is small compared to secondary microplastics, except for some areas of the Great Lakes in the United States (Eriksen et al. 2013b), but it is a largely avoidable source of pollution. Public pressure has already forced one major chemical company to commit to phasing out the use of plastic scrubbers in their products by 2015.
Much of the concern around microplastics concerns their role in introducing 
persistent organic pollutants (POPs) into marine foodwebs (Cole et al. 2011; Ivar do Sul and Costa 2014). Some of the additives used to modify the properties of plastics are biologically active, potentially affecting development and reproduction (Oehlmann et al. 2009; Meeker et al. 2009). Also, hydrophobic POPs in seawater are adsorbed onto plastic items (Carpenter et al. 1972; Mato et al. 2001; Teuten 
et al. 2009), and the smaller the particle, the more efficiently they accumulate tox-
ins (Andrady 2011). Thompson et al. (2004) showed that invertebrates from three feeding guilds (detritivores, deposit feeders and filter feeders) all consumed micro-scopic plastic particles, reinforcing the results of early selectivity experiments dem-onstrating that filter feeders can consume small plastic particles (De Mott 1988; Bern 1990). Small particles also are eaten by myctophid fish (Boerger et al. 2010), 
which are an important trophic link in many oceanic ecosystems (Davison and Asch 2011). The subject of POP transfer is explored in more detail by Rochman 
(2015), but it is worth noting that strict controls on the use of several POPs (e.g. 
PCBs, HCHs, DDT and its derivatives) have decreased their concentrations on plastic pellets over the last few decades (Ryan et al. 2012). There remain concerns about the health impacts of other compounds whose use is not as strictly regulated 18 P.G. Ryan
(e.g. PBDE, BPA, phthalates, nonylphenol, etc.; Meeker et al. 2009; Oehlmann 
et al. 2009; Gassel et al. 2013), and even the ingestion of uncontaminated micro-plastic particles can induce stress responses in fish (Rochman et al. 2013b).
1.9  Summary and Conclusions
Awareness of the threats posed by waste plastics to marine ecosystems developed gradually through the 1960s and 1970s. Most of the environmental impacts of plas-tic litter were identified in the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in numerous policy dis-cussions and recommendations to decrease the amount of waste plastic entering the environment (Chen 2015). Tightened controls by plastic manufacturers and convert-ers reduced losses of industrial pellets and legislation such as MARPOL Annex V reduced disposal of plastic wastes at sea (although compliance remains problematic in at least some sectors). However, it also became apparent that most litter entering the sea did so from diffuse, land-based sources that are more difficult to control. The rapid increase in global plastic production has resulted in an increase in the amount of plastic items and fragments in marine systems, which in many cases has offset the gains made by reducing losses of industrial pellets and dumping of ship-generated wastes. Plastic is becoming so abundant in some marine systems that it is actually altering the physical properties of the environment (e.g. Carson et al. 2011).
There was a lull in research activity in the 1990s, but the confirmation that micro-
plastics were a ubiquitous marine pollutant in the early 2000s, coupled with pub-licity around the formation of mid-ocean garbage patches, has stimulated renewed research interest and increased public awareness of the marine litter problem. One of the most urgent current challenges is the need to develop techniques to trace the smallest plastic particles through marine ecosystems, including uptake and release from marine organisms. We also need an improved understanding of the dynam-ics of waste plastics if we are to monitor the efficacy of mitigation measures (Ryan et al. 2009). Just as we can’t interpret the significance of plastic loads in organisms without assessing their turnover rates (Ryan 1988a), we need estimates of transport rates between environments and their biota, and of plastic degradation rates under different environmental conditions. However, we already know enough to say with certainty that the release of waste plastics into the environment is already impacting adversely on marine systems, and affecting human quality of life. Given that plastic litter is, at least theoretically, a wholly avoidable problem, increased effort is needed to stop the inappropriate disposal of waste plastics through a combination of educa-tion, product design, incentives, legislation and enforcement.

Global Distribution, Composition

M. Bergmann et al. (eds.), Marine Anthropogenic Litter,  DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-16510-3_2Abstract Marine debris is commonly observed everywhere in the oceans. Litter 
enters the seas from both land-based sources, from ships and other installations 
at sea, from point and diffuse sources, and can travel long distances before being stranded. Plastics typically constitute the most important part of marine litter some-times accounting for up to 100 % of floating litter. On beaches, most studies have demonstrated densities in the 1 item m
−2 range except for very high concentra-
tions because of local conditions, after typhoons or flooding events. Floating marine debris ranges from 0 to beyond 600 items km
−2. On the sea bed, the abundance of 
plastic debris is very dependent on location, with densities ranging from 0 to >7700 items km
−2, mainly in coastal areas. Recent studies have demonstrated that pollution 
of microplastics, particles <5 mm, has spread at the surface of oceans, in the water 
column and in sediments, even in the deep sea. Concentrations at the water surface ranged from thousands to hundred thousands of particles km
−2. Fluxes vary widely 
with factors such as proximity of urban activities, shore and coastal uses, wind and ocean currents. These enable the presence of accumulation areas in oceanic conver -
gence zones and on the seafloor, notably in coastal canyons. Temporal trends are not clear with evidences for increases, decreases or without changes, depending on loca-tions and environmental conditions. In terms of distribution and quantities, proper global estimations based on standardized approaches are still needed before consid-ering efficient management and reduction measures.

2.1  Introduction
Anthropogenic litter on the sea surface, beaches and seafloor has significantly 
increased over recent decades. Initially described in the marine environment in the 1960s, marine litter is nowadays commonly observed across all oceans (Ryan 2015). Together with its breakdown products, meso-particles (5–2.5 cm) 
and micro-particles (<5 mm), they have become more numerous and floating lit-ter items can be transported over long distances by prevailing winds and currents (Barnes et al. 2009).
Humans generate considerable amounts of waste and global quantities are con-
tinuously increasing, although waste production varies between countries. Plastic, the main component of litter, has become ubiquitous and forms sometimes up to 95 % of the waste that accumulates on shorelines, the sea surface and the seafloor. Plastic bags, fishing equipment, food and beverage containers are the most com-mon items and constitute more than 80 % of litter stranded on beaches (Topçu 
et al. 2013; Thiel et al. 2013). A large part of these materials decomposes only slowly or not at all. This phenomenon can also be observed on the seafloor where 90 % of litter caught in benthic trawls is plastic (Galil et al. 1995; Galgani et al. 1995, 2000; Ramirez-Llodra et al. 2013).
Even with standardized monitoring approaches, the abundance and distribution 
of anthropogenic litter show considerable spatial variability. Strandline surveys and cleanings as well as regular surveys at sea are now starting to be organized in many countries in order to generate information about temporal and spatial dis-tribution of marine litter (Hidalgo-Ruz and Thiel 2015). Accumulation rates vary widely and are influenced by many factors such as the presence of large cities, shore use, hydrodynamics and maritime activities. As a general pattern, accumu-lation rates appear to be lower in the southern than in the northern hemisphere. Enclosed seas such as the Mediterranean or Black Sea may harbor some of the highest densities of marine litter on the seafloor, reaching more than 100,000 items km
−2 (Galgani et al. 2000). In surface waters, the problem of plastic fragments 
has increased in the last few decades. From the first reports in 1972 (Wong et al. 1974), the quantities of microparticles in European seas have grown in comparison to data from 2000 (Thompson et al. 2004). Recent data suggest that quantities of microparticles appear to have stabilized in the North Atlantic Ocean over the last decade (Law et al. 2010). Little is known about trends in accumulation of debris in the deep sea. Debris densities on the deep seafloor decreased in some areas, such as in the Bay of Tokyo from 1996 to 2003 and in the Gulf of Lion between 1994 and 2009 (Kuriyama et al. 2003; Galgani et al. 2011a, b). By contrast, in 
some areas around Greece, the abundance of debris in deep waters has substan-tially increased over a period of eight years (Stefatos et al. 1999; Koutsodendris et al. 2008) and on the deep Arctic seafloor of the HAUSGARTEN observatory over aperiod of ten years (Bergmann and Klages 2012). Interpretation of tempo-ral trends is complicated by seasonal changes in the flow rate of rivers, currents, wave action, winds etc. Decreasing trends of macroplastics (>2.5 cm) on beaches 31

of remote islands suggest that regulations to reduce dumping at sea have been 
successful to some extent (Eriksson et al. 2013). However, both the demand and the production of plastics reached 299 million tons in 2013 and are continuing to increase (PlasticsEurope 2015).
2.2  Composition
Analysis of the composition of marine litter is important as it provides vital infor -
mation on individual litter items, which, in most cases, can be traced back to their sources. Sources of litter can be characterised in several ways (see also Browne 2015). One common method is to classify marine litter sources as either land-based or ocean-based, depending on where the litter entered the sea. Some items can be attributed with a high level of confidence to certain sources such as fish-ing gear, sewage-related debris and tourist litter. So-called use-categories provide valuable information for developing reduction measures (Galgani et al. 2011a).
Land-based sources include mainly recreational use of the coast, general pub-
lic litter, industry, harbors and unprotected landfills and dumps located near the coast, but also sewage overflows, introduction by accidental loss and extreme events. Marine litter can be transported to the sea by rivers (Rech et al. 2014; Sadri and Thompson 2014) and other industrial discharges and run-offs or can even be 
blown into the marine environment by winds. Ocean-based sources of marine litter include commercial shipping, ferries and liners, both commercial and recreational fishing vessels, military and research fleets, pleasure boats and offshore instal-lations such as platforms, rigs and aquaculture sites. Factors such as ocean cur -
rent patterns, climate and tides, the proximity to urban, industrial and recreational areas, shipping lanes and fishing grounds also influence the types and amount of litter that are found in the open ocean or along beaches.
Assessments of the composition of litter in different marine regions show that 
“plastics”, which include all petroleum-based synthetic materials, make up the largest proportion of overall litter pollution (e.g. Pham et al. 2014). Packaging, fishing nets and pieces thereof, as well as small pieces of unidentifiable plastic or polystyrene account for the majority of the litter items recorded in this category (Galgani et al. 2013). Some of this can take hundreds of years to break down or may never truly degrade (Barnes et al. 2009).
Whether or not visual observations from ships and airplanes, observations 
using underwater vehicles, manned or not, acoustics and finally trawling will provide the necessary detail to characterise litter and eventually define sources is not always clear. Previous notions that at a global scale most of the marine lit-ter is from land-based sources rather than from ships, were confirmed (Galgani et al. 2011b). Marine litter found on beaches consists primarily of plastics (bottles, bags, caps/lids, etc.), aluminium (cans, pull tabs) and glass (bottles) and mainly originates from shoreline recreational activities but is also transported by the sea by currents. In some cases, specific activities account for local litter densities well 32 F. Galgani et al.
above the global average (Pham et al. 2014). For example, marine litter densities 
on beaches can be increased by up to 40 % in summer because of high tourist numbers (Galgani et al. 2013). In some tourist areas, more than 75 % of the annual waste is generated in summer, when tourists produce on average 10–15 % more waste than the inhabitants; although not all of this waste enters the marine envi-ronment (Galgani et al. 2011b).
In some areas such as the North Sea or the Baltic Sea, the large diversity of 
items and the composition of the litter recorded indicate that shipping, fisheries and offshore installations are the main sources of litter found on beaches (Fleet et al. 2009). In some cases, litter can clearly be attributed to shipping, sometimes 
accounting for up to 95 % of all litter items in a given region, a large proportion of which originates from fishing activities often coming in the form of derelict nets (Van Franeker et al. 2011). In the North Sea, this percentage has been temporally stable (Galgani et al. 2011a) but litter may be supplemented by coastal recreational activities and riverine input (Lechner et al. 2014; Morritt et al. 2014). Studies 
along the US west coast, specifically off the coast of the southern California Bight (Moore and Allen 2000; Watters et al. 2010; Keller et al. 2010; Schlining et al. 
2013) have shown that ocean-based sources are the major contributors to marine debris in the eastern North Pacific with, for example, fishing gear being the most abundant debris off Oregon (June 1990). Investigations in coastal waters and beaches around the northern South China Sea in 2009 and 2010 indicated that plas-tics (45 %) and Styrofoam (23 %) accounted for more than 90 % of floating debris and 95 % of beached debris. The sources were primarily land-based and mostly attributed to coastal recreational activities (Lee et al. 2013). In the Mediterranean, reports from Greece classify land-based (69 % of the litter) and vessel-based (26 %) waste as the two predominant sources of litter (Koutsodendris et al. 2008).
2.3  Distribution
2.3.1  Beaches
Marine debris is commonly found at the sea surface or washed up on shorelines, 
and much of the work on marine litter has focussed on coastal areas because of the presence of sources, ease of access/assessment and for aesthetic reasons (McGranahan et al. 2007). Marine litter stranded on beaches is found along all coasts and has become a permanent reason for concern. Beach-litter data are derived from various approaches based on measurements of quantities or fluxes, considering various litter categories, and sampling on transects of variable width and length parallel or perpendicular to the shore. This makes it difficult to draw a quantitative global picture of beach litter distribution. In general, methods that are used for estimating amounts of marine debris on beaches are considered cheap and fairly reliable, but it is not clear how it relates to litter at sea, floating or not. Moreover, in some coastal habitats, litter may be of terrestrial origin and 33
2 Global Distribution, Composition and Abundance of Marine Litter
may never actually enter the sea. Most surveys are done with a focus on clean-
ing, thereby missing proper classification of litter items. When studies are not dedicated to specific items, litter is categorized by the type of material, function or both. Studies record the numbers, some the mass of litter and some do both (Galgani et al. 2013). Evaluations of beach litter reflect the long-term balance between inputs, land-based sources or stranding, and outputs from export, burial, degradation and cleanups. Then, measures of stocks may reflect the presence and amounts of debris. Factors influencing densities such as cleanups, storm events, rain fall, tides, hydrological changes may alter counts, evaluations of fluxes and, even if surveys can track changes in the composition of beach litter, they may not be sensitive enough to monitor changes in the abundance (Ryan et al. 2009). This problem can be circumvented by recording the rate, at which litter accumu-lates on beaches through regular surveys that are performed weekly, monthly or annually after an initial cleanup (Ryan et al. 2009). This is actually the most com-mon approach, revealing long-term patterns and cycles in accumulation, requir -
ing nonetheless much effort to do surveys. However, past studies may have vastly underestimated the quantity of available debris because sampling was too infre-quent (Smith and Markic 2013).
It is unfeasible to review the hundreds of papers on beach macro-debris, which 
often apply different approaches and lack sufficient detail (see also Hidalgo-Ruz and Thiel 2015). Most studies range from a local (Lee et al. 2013) to a regional 
scale (Bravo et al. 2009) and cover a broad temporal range. Information on sources, composition, amounts, usages, baseline data and environmental sig-nificance are often also gathered (Cordeiro and Costa 2010; Debrot et al. 2013; Rosevelt et al. 2013) as such data are easier collected. Most studies record all litter items encountered between the sea and the highest strandline on the upper shore. Sites are often chosen because of their ecological relevance, accessibility and par -
ticular anthropogenic activities and sources. Factors influencing the accumulation of debris in coastal areas include the shape of the beach, location and the nature of debris (Turra et al. 2014). In addition, most sediment-surface counts do not take buried litter into account and clearly underestimate abundance, which biases com-position studies. However, raking of beach sediments for litter may disturb the res-ident fauna. Apparently, a good correlation exists between accumulated litter and the amount arriving, indicating regular inputs and processes. Recent experiments with drift models in Japan indicate good correlation of flux with litter abundances on beaches (Yoon et al. 2010; Kataoka et al. 2013).
It appears that glass and hard plastics are accumulating more easily on rocky 
shores (Moore et al. 2001a). Litter often strands on beaches that lack strong preva-lent winds, which may blow them offshore (Galgani et al. 2000; Costa et al. 2011). 
Abundance or composition of litter often varies even among different parts of an individual beach (Claereboudt 2004) with higher amounts found frequently at high-tide or storm-level lines (Oigman-Pszczol and Creed 2007). Because of this 
and beach topography, patchiness is a common distribution pattern on beaches, especially for smaller and lighter items that are more easily dispersed or buried (Debrot et al. 1999).34 F. Galgani et al.
It is very difficult to compare litter concentrations of various coastal areas (with 
different population densities, hydrographic and geological conditions) obtained from 
various studies with different methodologies, especially when the sizes of debris items that are taken into account are also different. Nevertheless, common patterns indi-cate the prevalence of plastics, greater loads close to urban areas and touristic regions (Barnes et al. 2009). Data expressed as items m
−2 or larger areas are more convenient 
for comparisons. Most studies have reported densities in the m−2 range (Table 2.1). 
High concentrations of up to 37,000 items per 50-m beach line (78.3 items m−2) were 
recorded in Bootless Bay, Papua New Guinea (Smith 2012) because of specific local conditions, following typhoons (3,227 items m
−2; Liu et al. 2013) or flooding events 
(5,058 items m−2; Topçu et al. 2013). Data expressed as quantities per linear distance 
are more difficult to compare because the results depend on beach size/width. Plastic accounts for a large part of litter on beaches from many areas with up to 68 % in California (Rosevelt et al. 2013), 77 % in the south east of Taiwan (Liu et al. 2013),

86 % in Chile (Thiel et al. 2013), and 91 % in the southern Black Sea (Topçu et al. 
2013). However, other types of litter or specific types of plastic may also be important in some areas, in terms of type (Styrofoam, crafted wood) or use (fishing gear).
For trends in the amount of litter washed ashore and/or deposited on coastlines, 
beach litter monitoring schemes provide the most comprehensive data on indi-vidual litter items. Large data sets have already been held by institutions (Ribic et al. 2010) or NGO’s such as the Ocean Conservancy through their International Coastal Cleanup scheme for 25 years, or the EU OSPAR marine litter monitoring 
program, which started over 10 years ago and covers 78 beaches (Schultz et al. 2013). The lack of large-scale trends in the OSPAR-regions is probably due to small-scale heterogeneity of near-shore currents, which evoke small-scale hetero-geneity in deposition patterns on beaches (Schulz et al. 2013).
Ribic et al. (2010, 2012b) derived several nonlinear models to describe the 
development of pollution of coastal areas with marine litter. There were long-term changes in indicator debris on the Pacific Coast of the U.S. and Hawaii over the nine-year period of the study. Ocean-based indicator debris loads declined substan-tially while at the same time land-based indicator items had also declined, except for the North Pacific coast region where no change was observed. Variation in debris loads was associated with land- and ocean-based processes with higher land-based debris loads being related to larger local populations. Overall and at the local scale, drivers included fishing activities and oceanic current systems for ocean-based debris and human population density and land use status for land-based debris.
At local scales, concentrations of specific items may be largely driven by spe-
cific activities or new sources. For example, 41 % of the total debris from beaches in California was of Styrofoam origin, with no other explanation than an increased use of packaging, which degrades very easily (Ribic et al. 2012b). Small-sized items may form an important fraction of debris on beaches. For example, up to 75 % of total debris from the southern Black Sea was smaller than 10 cm (Topçu et al. 2013). Small-sized particles include fragments smaller than 2.5 cm (Galgani et al. 2011b), the so-called meso-particles or mesodebris, which is, unlike macrodebris, often bur -
ied and not always targeted by cleanups. Stranding fluxes are then difficult to evalu-ate and a decrease in the amount of litter at sea will only slow the rate of stranding. Little attention has been paid to sampling design and statistical power even though optimal sampling strategies have been proposed (Ryan et al. 2009). Densities of small-sized debris were found to be very high in some areas where, in addition to floating debris, they can pose a direct threat to wildlife, especially to birds that are known to ingest plastic (Kühn et al. 2015; Lusher 2015).
2.3.2  Floating Marine Debris
Floating debris constitutes the fraction of debris in the marine environment, which is transported by wind and currents at the sea surface, and is thus directly related to the pathways of litter at sea. Floating litter items can be transported by the 36 F. Galgani et al.
currents until they sink to the seafloor, be deposited on the shore or degrade over 
time (Andrady 2015). While the occurrence of anthropogenic litter items floating 
in the world oceans was reported already decades ago (Venrick et al. 1972; Morris 
1980), the existence of accumulation zones of Floating Marine Debris (FMD) in oceanic gyres has only recently gained worldwide attention (Moore et al. 2001b).
Synthetic polymers constitute the major part of floating marine debris, the fate 
of which depends on their physico-chemical properties and the environmental con-ditions. As high-production volume polymers such as polyethylene and polypro-pylene have lower densities than seawater, they float until they are washed ashore or sink because their density changes due to biofouling and leaching of additives. While being subject to biological, photic or chemical degradation processes, they can be physically degraded gradually into smaller fragments until becom-ing microplastics, which is often defined as the size fraction <5 mm. This fraction requires different monitoring techniques, such as surface net trawls, and is there-fore treated elsewhere (Löder and Gerdts 2015; Lusher 2015). Floating macrolitter is typically monitored by visual observation from ships, though results from net trawls are also being reported. The spatial coverage and thus the representative-ness of the quantification depends on the methodology applied. Also, observation conditions, such as sea state, elevation of the observation position and ship speed affect results.
Existing datasets indicate substantial spatial variability and persistent gradients 
in floating marine litter concentrations (e.g. Erikssen et al. 2014). The variations can be attributed to differential release pathways or specific litter accumulation areas. Because of inconsistent reporting schemes used in scientific publications, data sets are often not comparable. Typically, item numbers are reported per sur -
face area. Mass-based concentrations can then only be derived through estimates. Differences are found between studies in size ranges, concentration units and item categories used. As the number of pieces increases drastically with decreasing size of the observed litter items, the reporting of corresponding size classes is of high importance for comparing debris abundances among studies. Apart from the dif-ficulty in reporting sizes correctly from shipboard observations, many publications use different size-range categories.
In addition to research activities, the quantification of floating litter is part of 
the assessment schemes of national and international monitoring frameworks. Monitoring of the quantity, composition and pathways of floating litter can con-tribute to an efficient management of waste streams and the protection of the marine environment. The European Marine Strategy Framework Directive, national programs, the Regional Sea Conventions and international agreements such as the United Nations Environmental Programme consider the monitoring of floating litter (Chen 2015). Visual assessment approaches include the use of research vessels, marine mammal surveys, commercial shipping carriers and dedi-cated litter observation surveys. Aerial surveys are often conducted for larger items (Pichel et al. 2012). However, available data for floating litter are currently dif-ficult to compare because existing observation schemes (NOAA, UNEP, Hellenic Marine Environment Protection Association—HELMEPA, etc.) apply different 37
2 Global Distribution, Composition and Abundance of Marine Litter
approaches, observation schemes and category lists (Galgani et al. 2011a, b). 
Some approaches involve the reporting by volunteers (HELMEPA, Arthur et al. 
2011). While the main principle of monitoring floating debris through visual observation is very simple there are not many data sets, which allow a comparison of debris abundance. Some data sets are accessible as peer-reviewed publications or through reports from international organizations. However, the regions covered are very limited and monitoring occurs only sporadically.
Globally, the reported densities of floating marine debris pieces >2 cm ranges 
from 0 to beyond 600 items km
−2. Ship-based visual surveys in the North Sea 
German Bight yielded 32 items km−2 on average (Thiel et al. 2011). The inte-
gration over different surveys and seasons resulted in litter densities of 25 items km
−2 at the White Bank area, 28 items km−2 around the island of Helgoland and 
39 items km−2 in the East Frisian part of the German Bight. More than 70 % of 
the observed items were identified as plastics. From 2002 to 2006, aerial marine mammals surveys were used for the quantification of floating litter. Results were reported as sightings km
−1, ranging from 0 to beyond 1 item km−1. Concentrations 
in coastal waters appeared to be lower than in offshore regions (Herr 2009).
In the northern Mediterranean Sea, in an offshore area of ca. 100 × 200 km 
between Marseille and Nice and also in the Corsican Channel, floating debris was quantified during marine mammals surveys. A maximum of 55 pieces km
−2 
was recorded with strong spatial variability (Gerigny et al. 2011). In the Ligurian Sea, data were collected through ship-based visual observation in 1997 and 2000. Between 15 and 25 objects and between 1.5 and 3.0 objects km
−2 were found in 
1997 and 2000, respectively, without specification of the size ranges used (Aliani and Molcard 2003). V oluntary surveys through HELMEPA made from commer -
cial shipping vessels in the Mediterranean Sea revealed a concentration of 2 items km
−2 with higher concentrations in coastal areas but also longer transects without 
any litter encounters. While plastic material accounted for the highest proportion (83 %) of litter, textiles, paper, metal and wood comprised 17 % (UNEP 2009). No size ranges were given, but the described conditions during observation indicate that only larger items were considered. A large-scale survey in the Mediterranean Sea found 78 % of the observed objects larger than 2 cm to be of anthropogenic origin (Suaria and Aliani 2014). Plastic constituted 96 % of these. While high-est densities (>52 items km
−2) were reported from the Adriatic Sea and Algerian 
basin, lowest densities (<6.3 items km−2) were recorded in the central Thyrrenian 
and Sicilian Sea. Densities in other areas ranged between 11 and 31 items km−2 
(Suaria and Aliani 2014).
Visual aerial surveys were conducted in the Black Sea, flying slow at low alti-
tude above the Kerch Strait, the southern part of the Azov Sea and on the coastal Russian Black Sea. Concentrations in the Kerch Strait and the Azov Sea were comparable at 66 items km
−2 and twice as high as those from the Black Sea (BSC 
2007).
In a visual observation study in the north Pacific, ca. 56 km off Japan, 
Shiomoto and Kameda (2005) found densities of 0.1–0.8 items km−2 at a 
size >5 cm.38 F. Galgani et al.
A study at the east coast of Japan utilized surface trawl nets for sampling 
on transects of 10 min at 2 knots with a net opening of 50 cm and a mesh size 
of 333 µm. The size of plastic pieces captured ranged from 1 to 280 mm. Pieces >11 mm accounted only for 8 % and particles of 1–3 mm accounted for 62 % at total average litter mass of 3600 g km
−2 (Yamashita and Tanimura 2007).
Visual observation studies in southern Chilean fjords revealed 1–250 items 
km−2 >2 cm during seven oceanographic cruises from 2002 to 2005 (Hinojosa 
and Thiel 2009; Hinojosa et al. 2011; Thiel et al. 2013). Typically, densities 
in the northern areas ranged from 10 to 50 items km−2. Matsumara and Nasu 
(1997) reported 0.5 items km−2 in the waters northwest of Hawaii, close to the 
so-called Pacific garbage patch, compared with 9 pieces km−2 in southeast Asia. 
Debris densities in the waters off British Columbia (Canada), comprised 0.9–2.3 pieces km
−2 with a mean of 1.5 items km−2 (Williams et al. 2011), but no 
size range was given. In the Gulf of Mexico, Lecke-Mitchell and Mullin (1997) recorded 1.0–2.4 pieces km
−2 during cetacean survey flights (Table 2.2).
FMD density in the northern South China Sea was quantified by net trawls 
at 4.9 (0.3–16.9) items km−2, with Styrofoam (23 %) and other plastics (45 %) 
dominating (Zhou et al. 2011). More than 99 % of FMD was small- (<2.5 cm) or medium-sized (2.5–10 cm). Large items (10–100 cm) were detected by visual

observation resulting in mean concentrations of 0.025 items km−2 (Zhou et al. 
2011). In the northeast Indian Ocean, Ryan (2013) reported a large difference 
in the concentration of marine debris between the Strait of Malacca (578 ± 219 
items km−2) and the Bengal Sea (8.8 ± 1.4 items km−2). By contrast, Uneputty 
and Evans (1997) reported concentrations >375 items km−2 in Amon Bay, east 
Indonesia.
In 2009, a 4,400-km cruise from the American west coast to the North Pacific 
subtropical gyre and back to the coast provided data during 74 h of observation 
corresponding to a transect length of 1,343 km (Titmus and Hyrenbach 2011). A 
single observer at 10 m above the sea level recorded a total of 3,868 pieces, of which 90 % were fragments and 96 % of these were plastic. Eighty-one percent of the items had a size of 2–10 cm, 14 % of 10–30 cm and 5 % of >30 cm. The density of debris increased towards the centre of the gyre where smaller, proba-bly older and weathered pieces were found. The authors note that visual observa-tions are constrained by the inability to detect smaller fragments (<20 mm) and to retrieve the observed items for further analysis and concluded that visual observa-tions can be easily conducted from ships of opportunity, which provide a useful and inexpensive tool for monitoring debris accumulation and distribution at sea.
A specific case of floating marine litter is abandoned or lost fishing gear, such 
as nets or longlines. These items cause significant harm when abandoned, as they continue to catch marine wildlife (Kühn et al. 2015). In 2003, a major effort, including the identification of possible accumulation areas by satellite imaging and ocean current modelling, was made to select appropriate areas for aerial surveys in search for abandoned fishing gear in the Gulf of Alaska (Pichel et al. 2012). Employing a wide range of methodologies including visual video, infrared video and Lidar imaging during 14 days of observation, 102 items of anthropogenic ori-gin were sighted.
Modelling of oceanographic currents can help to identify pathways and accu-
mulation areas, thus enabling source attribution (Martinez et al. 2009; Maximenko et al. 2012). A modelling approach in the North Sea identified seasonal signals in litter reaching the coasts (Neumann et al. 2014). The concentrations and distribu-tion patterns of floating marine debris can be expected to change according to cli-matic changes (Howell et al. 2012). Lebreton et al. (2012) modelled the global oceanic currents in view of the cycling and distribution of introduced debris. Input scenarios were based on population density and major shipping lanes. A 30-year projection showed the accumulation of floating debris in ocean gyres and enclosed seas. These studies have the potential to investigate pathways and to guide mon-itoring to enable effective implementation of management measures and the assessment of their efficiency. Modelling is also used to predict the pathways and impacts of large quantities of debris introduced through natural events such as tsu-namis and related run-offs (Lebreton and Borrero 2013). Single events may drasti-
cally increase local debris concentrations. A study combining available worldwide data with a modelling approach estimated the weight of the global plastic pollution to comprise 75 % macroplastic (>200 mm), 11 % mesoplastic (4.75–200 mm), and 11 and 3 % in two microplastic size classes, respectively (Erikssen et al. 2014). 40 F. Galgani et al.
The data suggest that a minimum of 233,400 tons of larger plastic items are adrift 
in the world’s oceans compared to 35,540 tons of microplastics.
Floating marine litter can be considered as ubiquitous, occurring even in the most 
remote areas of the planet such as the Arctic (Bergmann and Klages 2012). Floating litter items are also present in the remote Antarctic Ocean, although densities are low and cannot be expressed as concentrations (Barnes et al. 2010). Some 42 % of the observed 120 objects south of 63°S consisted of plastic. Debris items were observed even as far south as 73°S. However, the small number of surveys and low total object counts do not allow for trend assessments. In the African part of the Southern Ocean, 52 items (>1 cm) were recorded during a 10,467 km transect survey, yielding densi-ties ranging from 0.03 to 6 items km
−2 (Ryan et al. 2014).
The diversity and non-comparability of monitoring approaches used cur -
rently hinders a comparison of absolute pollution indicators and spatial or tem-poral assessments. The development and widespread implementation of protocols for monitoring, such as the ongoing efforts for the implementation of the MSFD (Galgani et al. 2013), could improve the quality of data gathered. Established pro-tocols should be accompanied by training schemes, quality assurance and control procedures. The implementation of standardized protocols in the monitoring of riverine litter may enable source allocation.
Unfortunately, data acquired by NGOs or authorities are often not published 
in peer-reviewed journals and are therefore not readily accessible. A joint inter -
national database would facilitate the collection of such data and improve stand-ardization and comparability. The collection of data, e.g. on-site through tablet computer applications, the standardization of reporting formats and the streamlin-ing of data flows would facilitate data treatment. More easily accessible data sets can then help to prioritize activities and to monitor the success of litter reduction measures.
While monitoring by human observers is a simple and straightforward 
approach, in particular for large-scale and frequent surveys, automatized approaches are promising. Developing technologies may lead to the use of digital imaging and image recognition techniques for the autonomous large-scale moni-toring of litter (Hanke and Piha 2011).
The implementation of international frameworks such as the EU MSFD, 
Regional Action Plans against Marine Litter and the agreements of the Rio +20 Conference (United Nations 2012) require improvement of data availability and quality and can therefore be expected to provide the basis for coordinated assess-ments in the future.
2.3.3  Seafloor
Change in the nature, presence or abundance of anthropogenic debris on the seafloor is much less widely investigated than sea surface patterns. Studies typically focus on continental shelves, as sampling difficulties, inaccessibility 41

and costs rarely allow for research in deeper waters, which accounts for almost 
half of the planet’s surface. Deep-sea surveys are important because ca. 50 % of plastic litter items sink to the seafloor and even low-density polymers such as polyethylene and propylene may lose buoyancy under the weight of fouling (Engler 2012). While acoustic approaches do not enable discrimina-tion of different types of debris on the seafloor except for metals and may not record smaller objects, trawling was considered the most adequate method when taking into account mesh sizes and net opening width (Galgani et al. 2011b) (Fig. 2.1). However, nets were primarily designed to collect specific biota leading to sample bias and underestimation of benthic litter quanti-ties. Therefore, pole trawling has been suggested as the most consistent sur -
vey method for the assessment of benthic marine litter (Galgani and Andral 1998), although rather destructive to seafloor habitats because of the scraping of sediments and inhabiting biota. However, trawls cannot be used in rocky habitats or on hard substrates and they do not allow for a precise localization of individual items. Samples from trawls are likely to underestimate debris abundance and may miss some types of debris altogether such as monofila-ments because of variability in the sampling efficiency for different debris items (Watters et al. 2010). Fibres from the trawl nets themselves (Murray and Cowie 2011) may contaminate samples. Finally, it does not enable the assess-
ment of impacts of litter on habitats when it contributes its own impacts on the seafloor, which are more severe for the benthic fauna and habitats than the lit-ter items caught by trawl.

Strategies to investigate seabed debris are similar to those for evaluating the 
abundance and composition of benthic species. Mass is less often determined 
for marine debris, because very large items may increase variability in measures. Although floating debris, such as that found in the highly publicized “gyres” and/or convergence zones, is currently the focus of attention, debris accumulating on the seafloor has a high potential to impact benthic habitats and organisms. Fourty-three studies were published between 2000 and 2013. Until recently, only few of them covered greater geographic areas or depths. The majority of these studies uti-lized a bottom trawl for sampling as part of fish stock assessments. More recently, remotely operated vehicles and towed camera systems were increasingly used for deep-sea surveys (e.g. Pham et al. 2014, see Fig. 2.2).
The geographic distribution of debris on the ocean floor is strongly influenced 
by hydrodynamics, geomorphology and human factors (Galgani et al. 1996; Pham et al. 2014). Moreover, there are notable temporal variations, particularly seasonal, with tendencies for accumulation and concentration of marine litter in particular

geographic areas (Galgani et al. 1995). Interpretation of trends is, however, dif-
ficult because the ageing of plastics at depth is unknown and the accumulation of debris on the seafloor certainly began before scientific investigations started in the 1990s.
In estuaries, large rivers are responsible for substantial input of debris to 
the seabed (Lechner et al. 2014; Rech et al. 2014). Rivers can also transport waste far offshore because of their high flow rate and strong currents (Galgani et al. 1995, 1996, 2000). Alternatively, small rivers and estuaries can also act 
as a sink for litter, when weak currents facilitate deposition on shores and banks (Galgani et al. 2000). In addition, litter may accumulate upstream of salinity fronts being transported to the sea later, when river flow velocity is increasing.
Plastics were found on the seabed of all seas and oceans and the presence of 
large amounts has been reported (Galil et al. 1995; Galgani et al. 2000; Barnes et al. 2009) but remains uncommon in remote areas such as Antarctica, par -
ticularly in deep waters (Barnes et al. 2009). So far, sampling has been limited to some dozens of trawls and van Cauwenberghe et al. (2013) and Fischer et al. (2015) found pieces of microplastics in deep-sea sediments from the south-ern Atlantic and Kuril-Kamchatka-trench area, respectively. Large-scale evalu-ations of seabed debris distribution and densities are more common in other regions (Galgani et al. 2000). However, these studies mostly involve extrapola-
tions from small-scale investigations mainly in coastal areas such as bays, estuar -
ies and sounds. The abundance of plastic debris shows strong spatial variations, with mean densities ranging from 0 to more than 7,700 items km
−2 (Table 2.3). 
Mediterranean sites show the greatest densities owing to the combination of a densely populated coastline, shipping in coastal waters and negligible tidal flow. Moreover, the Mediterranean is a closed basin with limited water exchange through the Strait of Gibraltar. Generally, litter densities are higher in coastal seas (Lee et al. 2006) because of large-scale residual ocean circulation patterns but also 
because of extensive riverine input (Wei et al. 2012). However, debris that reaches the seabed may have been transported over considerable distances before sinking to the seafloor, e.g. as a consequence of heavy fouling. Indeed, some accumula-tion zones were identified far from coasts (Galgani and Lecornu 2004; Bergmann and Klages 2012; Woodall et al. 2014, 2015). Accordingly, even in the shallow 
subtidal abundance and distribution patterns can differ substantially from the adja-cent strandlines with plastics being the most important fraction at sea. In general, bottom debris tends to become trapped in areas of low circulation where sediments are accumulating (Galgani et al. 1996; Schlining et al. 2013; Pham et al. 2014). The consequence is an accumulation of plastic debris in bays, including lagoons of coral reefs, rather than in the open sea. These are the locations where large amounts of derelict fishing gear accumulate and cause damage to shallow-water biota and habitats (Dameron et al. 2007; Kühn et al. 2015).
Continental shelves are considered as accumulation zones for marine debris (Lee 
et al. 2006), however, often with lower concentrations of debris than adjacent can-yons because debris is not retained but washed offshore by currents associated with 44 F. Galgani et al.Table 2.3  Comparison of litter densities on the seafloor from recent data worldwide (non-exhaustive list)

Schlining et al. 2013; Fischer et al. 2015; Vieira et al. 2014); Galgani et al. (2000) observed trends in deep-sea pollution over time (1992–98) off the European coast with an extremely variable distribution and debris accumulating in submarine can-yons. Miyake et al. (2011) recorded debris down to 7,216 m depth in video surveys from the Ryukyu Trench. Litter was primarily composed of plastic and accumulated in deep-sea trenches and depressions. Accordingly, several authors (Galgani et al. 
1996; Mordecai et al. 2011; Pham et al. 2014) concluded that submarine canyons may act as a conduit for the transport of marine debris into the deep sea. Recent studies conducted in coastal deep-sea areas along California and the Gulf of Mexico (Watters et al. 2010; Schlining et al. 2013; Wei et al. 2012) confirmed this pattern. Also, an analysis of the composition and abundance of man-made, benthic marine debris collected in bottom trawl surveys at 1,347 randomly-selected stations along the US west coast in 2007 and 2008 indicated that densities increased significantly with depth, ranging from 30 items km
−2 in shallow (55–183 m) to 128 items km−2 
in the deepest waters surveyed (550–1,280 m) (Keller et al. 2010). Higher densities 
at the bottom were also found in particular areas such as those around rocks, wrecks as well as in depressions or channels (Galgani et al. 1996). Deep submarine exten-
sions of coastal rivers influence the distribution of seabed debris. In some areas, local water movements transport debris away from the coast to accumulate in zones of high sedimentation. In the case of the Mississippi river, for example, the front can-yon was a focal point for litter, probably due to bottom topography and currents (Wei et al. 2012). Under these conditions, the distal deltas of rivers can fan out in deeper waters, creating areas of high accumulation. Many authors (Galgani et al. 1996; Moore and Allen 2000; Wei et al. 2012) show that circulation may be influenced 
by strong currents occurring in the upper part of canyons, which decrease rapidly in deeper areas resulting in an increased confinement with a litter distribution that seems to be temporally more stable as a consequence.
A great variety of human activities such as fishing, urban development and tour -
ism contribute to the distribution pattern of debris on the seabed. Debris from the fishing industry is prevalent in fishing areas (Watters et al. 2010; Schlining et al. 2013; Vieira et al. 2014). This type of material may account for a high proportion of debris. In the eastern China Sea (Lee et al. 2006), for example, 72 % of debris is made of plastic, mainly pots, nets, Octopus jars, and fishing lines. Investigations 
using submersibles at depths beyond the continental shelf and canyons have revealed substantial quantities of debris in remote areas. Galgani and Lecornu (2004) counted 0.2–0.9 pieces of plastic per linear kilometre at the HAUSGARTEN 
observatory (2500 m) in the Fram Strait (Arctic). Fifteen items, of which 13 were plastic, were observed during one dive between 5,330 and 5,552 m (‘Molloy Hole’), which reflects the local funnel-like topography and downwards directed eddies acting as particle trap. Bergmann and Klages (2012) reported doubled litter quantities between 2002 and 2011 in the HAUSGARTEN area. The accumulation 47
2 Global Distribution, Composition and Abundance of Marine Litter
trends reported in that study raise particular concern as degradation rates of most 
polymers in deep-sea environments are assumed to be even slower due to the absence of light, low temperature and oxygen concentrations.
2.3.4  Microplastics
Similar to large debris, there is growing concern about the implications of the diverse microparticles in the marine environment, which are particles ≤1 μm 
(Galgani et al. 2012; Thompson et al. 2004). Most microparticles are tiny plas-tic fragments known as microplastics, although other types of microparticles exist, such as fine fly ash particles emitted with flue gases from combustion, rub-ber from tyre wear and tear as well as glass and metal particles, all of which con-stantly enter the marine environment. The abundance and global distribution of microplastics in the oceans appeared to have steadily increased over past decades (Cole et al. 2011; Claessens et al. 2011; Thompson 2015), while a decrease in the 
average size of plastic litter has been observed over this time period (Barnes et al. 2009). In recent years, the existence of microplastics and their potential impact on wildlife and human health has received increased public and scientific attention (Betts 2008; Galloway 2015; Lusher 2015).
Microplastics comprise a very heterogeneous assemblage of particles that vary 
in size, shape, color, chemical composition, density, and other characteristics. They can be subdivided by usage and source as (i) ‘primary’ microplastics, pro-duced either for indirect use as precursors (nurdles or virgin resin pellets) for the production of polymer consumer products, or for direct use, such as in cosmetics, scrubs and abrasives and (ii) ‘secondary’ microplastics, resulting from the break-down of larger plastic material into smaller fragments. Fragmentation is caused by a combination of mechanical forces, e.g. waves and/or photochemical processes triggered by sunlight. Some ‘degradable’ plastics are even designed to fragment quickly into small particles, however, the resulting material does not necessarily biodegrade (Roy et al. 2011). The various sources of microplastics and the path-ways into the oceans are summarized in detail by Browne (2015).
In order to understand the environmental impacts of microplastics, many stud-
ies have quantified their abundance in the marine environment. One of the major difficulties in making large-scale spatial and temporal comparisons between exist-ing studies is the wide variety of methods that have been applied to isolate, iden-tify and quantify marine microplastics (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012). For meaningful 
comparisons to be made and robust monitoring studies to be conducted, it is there-fore important to define common methodological criteria for estimating abun-dance, distribution and composition of microplastics (Löder and Gerdts 2015).
Microplastics normally float at the sea surface because they are less dense than sea-
water. However, the buoyancy and specific gravity of plastics may change during their time at sea due to weathering and biofouling, which results in their distribution across the sea surface, the deeper water column, the seabed, beaches and sea ice (Colton and 48 F. Galgani et al.
Knapp 1974; Barnes et al. 2009; Law et al. 2010; Browne et al. 2010; Claessens et al. 
2011; Collignon et al. 2012; Obbard et al. 2014). Until now, only a limited number 
of global surveys have been conducted on the quantity and distribution of microplas-tics in the oceans (Lusher 2015). Most surveys focused on specific oceanic regions 
and habitats, such as coastal areas, regional seas, gyres or the poles (Thompson et al. 2004, Collignon et al. 2012; Rios and Moore 2007). Concentrations of microplas-tics at sea vary from thousands to hundreds of thousands of particles km
−2 and latest 
reports suggest that microplastic pollution has spread throughout the world’s oceans from the water column (Lattin et al. 2010; Cole et al. 2011) to sediments even of the deep sea (Moore et al. 2001b; Law et al. 2010; Claessens et al. 2011; Cole et al. 2011; 
Collignon et al. 2012; Erikssen et al. 2014; Reisser et al. 2013; van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013; Woodall et al. 2014; Fischer et al. 2015). Recently, microplastics were also 
recorded from Arctic sea ice in densities two orders of magnitude higher than those previously reported from highly contaminated surface waters, such as those of the Pacific gyre (Obbard et al. 2014). This has important implications considering the pro-jected acceleration in sea ice melting due to global climate change and concomitant release of microplastics to the Arctic marine ecosystem.
Time-series data on the composition and abundance of microplastics are sparse. 
However, available evidence on long-term trends suggests various patterns in microplastic concentrations. A decade ago, Thompson et al. (2004) demonstrated the broad spatial extent and accumulation of this type of contamination. They found plastic particles in sediments from U.K. beaches and archived among the plankton in samples dating back to the 1960s with a significant increase in abun-dance over time. More recent evidence indicated that microplastic concentrations in the North Pacific subtropical gyre have increased by two orders of magnitude in the past four decades (Goldstein et al. 2013). However, no change in microplastic concentration was observed at the surface of the North Atlantic gyre for a period of 30 years (Law et al. 2010).
Less is known about the composition of microplastics in the oceans. Evidence 
suggests a temporal decrease in the average size of plastic litter (Barnes et al. 2009; Erikssen et al. 2014). Studies based on the stomach contents of shearwa-ters (Puffinus tenuirostris) in the Bering Sea also indicated a decrease in ‘indus-trial’ primary pellets and an increase in ‘user’ plastic between the 1970s and the late 1990s (Vlietstra and Parga 2002) but constant levels over the last decade (Van Franeker et al. 2011). Similarly, long-term data from The Netherlands since the 1980s show a decrease of industrial plastics and an increase in user plastics, with shipping and fisheries being the main sources (van Franeker 2012).
2.4  Summary and Conclusions
Marine debris is now commonly observed everywhere in the oceans and avail-able information suggests that marine debris is highly dynamic in space and time. However, we need standardized methodologies for quantification and 49
2 Global Distribution, Composition and Abundance of Marine Litter
characterisation of marine litter to be able to achieve global estimates. Litter enters 
the sea from land-based sources, from ships and other installations at sea, from point and diffuse sources, and can travel long distances before being deposited. While plastic typically constitutes a lower proportion of the discarded waste, it represents the most important part of marine litter with sometimes up to 95 % of the waste, and has become ubiquitous even in remote polar regions. However, trends are not clear with quantities having slightly decreased over the last 20 years in some locations, notably in the western Mediterranean. At the same time no change in litter quantities are evident in the convergence zones from oceanic basins or beaches. In other loca-tions, however, including the deep seafloor, densities have increased.
Accumulation rates vary widely with factors such as proximity of urban activi-
ties, shore and coastal uses, wind and ocean currents. These enable the accumulation of litter in specific areas at the sea surface, on beaches or on the seafloor. Before an accurate estimate of global debris quantities can be made, basic information is still needed on sources, inputs, degradation processes and fluxes. For this and because there is considerable variation in methodology between regions and investigators, more valuable and comparable data have to be obtained from standardized sampling programs. In terms of distribution and quantities, important questions concerning the balance between the increase of waste and plastic productions, reduction meas-ures and the quantities found at the surface and on shorelines remain unanswered. Potentially, important accumulation areas with high densities of debris are still to be discovered. It is now clear that managers and policy makers will need to bet-ter understand the distribution of litter in order to assess and evaluate precisely the effectiveness of measures implemented to reduce marine litter pollution.

M. Bergmann et al. (eds.), Marine Anthropogenic Litter,  DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-16510-3_3Abstract The increasing global production and use of plastics has led to an 
accumulation of enormous amounts of plastic litter in the world’s oceans. 
Characteristics such as low density, good mechanical properties and low cost allow for successful use of plastics in industries and everyday life but the high durability leads to persistence of the synthetic polymers in the marine environ-ment where they cause harm to a great variety of organisms. In the diverse marine habitats, including beaches, the sea surface, the water column, and the seafloor, plastics are exposed to different environmental conditions that either acceler -
ate or decelerate the physical, chemical and biological degradation of plastics. Degradation of plastics occurs primarily through solar UV-radiation induced photo oxidation reactions and is, thus, most intensive in photic environments such as the sea surface and on beaches. The rate of degradation is temperature-dependent resulting in considerable deceleration of the processes in seawater, which is a good heat sink. Below the photic zone in the water column, plastics degrade very slowly resulting in high persistence of plastic litter especially at the seafloor. Biological decomposition of plastics by microorganisms is negligible in the marine environ-ment because the kinetics of biodegradation at sea is particularly slow and oxygen supply for these processes limited. Degradation of larger plastic items leads to the formation of abundant small microplastics. The transport of small particles to the seafloor and their deposition in the benthic environment is facilitated by the colo-nization of the material by fouling organisms, which increase the density of the particles and force them to sink.

3.1  Introduction
Studies on the occurrence of marine litter on beaches and as flotsam generally 
find plastics to be the major component of the mix of debris (Galgani et al. 2015). Plastics have diverse uses and are gaining popularity in building and packaging applications because of their ease of processing, durability and relatively low cost (Andrady and Neal 2009). However, this predominance of plastics in litter is not the result of relatively more plastics being littered compared to paper, paperboard or wood products reaching the oceans, but because of the exceptional durability or persistence of plastics in the environment. Data on plastic debris on sediments are more limited (Spengler and Costa 2008) but suggest that plastics represent a significant fraction of the benthic debris as well (Watters et al. 2010). Quantitative information on the density of litter on beaches or in the ocean classified according to the class of plastic, are not available. Usual classification is by geometry (e.g. fiber) or by product type (e.g. cigarette butts). Also the surveys of water-borne plastic debris collected via neuston net sampling of surface waters (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012) and even beach studies (Ng and Obbard 2006; Browne et al. 2011) close to the water line, seriously underestimate the magnitude of plastic litter. Not only do these exclude the negatively buoyant plastics but also fragments smaller than the mesh-size of the nets used.
3.2  Buoyancy and Sampling Errors
Of the five classes of the commonly used plastics (or commodity thermoplastics), polyethylenes (PE) and polypropylenes (PP) as well as the expanded form of poly-styrene or polystyrene foam (EPS) are less dense than sea water while others such as poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC) and poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) are nega-tively buoyant and sink into the mid water column or to the sediment (Andrady 2011). Significantly, one of the key fishing-gear related plastics, nylon or pol-yamide (PA), also belongs to this category and hence the negative buoyancy of these items likely explains their virtual absence in beach litter or flotsam surveys, despite their high volume use at sea. However, there are exceptions to this general expectation that is based on the properties of the pure resins such as with virgin resin pellets or prils found commonly in sampled debris. Some plastic products are compounded with fillers and other additives that alter the density of the virgin plastic material. These additives are needed to ensure ease of processing the plas-tic as well as to obtain the mechanical properties demanded of the final product. Where the density is increased because additives, such as fillers, are incorporated, the material may not float in surface water and, therefore, not be counted in net sampling. Accordingly, plastics such as PS, PET and PVC, which are denser than sea water, should be missing from floating samples as well. In fact, however, they might be included in flotsam samples because products such as bottles, bags and 59

foams made from these plastics trap air. This is clearly the case with EPS foam 
used in floats, bait boxes and insulation that generally constitutes a highly visible and major fraction of persistent litter in the ocean environment.
The main items of debris are different plastic products (or their fragments) as 
illustrated in the global beach clean data compiled by Ocean Conservancy for 2009. The data in Table 3.1 summarize the beach cleanup efforts regularly spon-
sored by the organization: beach cleanup is carried out by volunteers who also count and tabulate the litter over an area assigned to each person. The data are aggregated and summarized by the Ocean Conservancy.
A second inefficiency in sampling of plastic debris at all marine sites is the 
minimum particle size isolated. The procedure of using plankton nets to sample water and separating particles visually after sieving or by floatation from sediment samples invariably fails to catch the micro-sized fragments of plastics. Commonly used nets have a mesh size of about 330 µm. While the meso-sized plastics are rea-sonably represented in these samples the micro-sized and nano-scale particles are grossly underestimated. Since a great majority of the floating litter is generated on land and transported to the ocean, one would expect the resin types in the litter to be consistent with the production volume shown in Table 3.2. As the mass fraction 
of the unsampled microplastics is likely miniscule by comparison to the macro-plastic debris, the statistics of plastics by resin type in water samples show PE and PP to be the most abundant, consistent with the production data in Table 3.2.
3.3  Fate of Plastics Entering the Oceans
Common plastics used in packaging and encountered in the marine environment are persistent recalcitrant materials. In common with other organic materials they do ultimately degrade but the rate at which environmental degradation proceeds is painstakingly slow for plastics. Several agencies can potentially bring about the Table 3.1  Marine debris items removed from the global coastline and waterways during the

degradation (or chemical breakdown of the polymer molecules with consequent 
change in material properties) in the environment. These are primarily as follows:
(a) solar UV-induced photodegradation reactions
(b) thermal reactions including thermo-oxidation
(c) hydrolysis of the polymer
(d) microbial biodegradation
Of these, only the first or the light-induced oxidative degradation is particularly effec-
tive in the ocean environment and that only with plastics floating at the sea surface or littered on beaches (Cooper and Corcoran 2010). Slow thermal oxidation of plas-tics also proceeds in concert with photo-oxidation, especially on beaches. However, no hydrolysis or significant biodegradation of plastics is anticipated in the ocean.
Different measurable properties of a plastic might be altered as a result of 
weathering. Some of these are properties that are directly relevant to the perfor -
mance of common products made from them (Singh and Sharma 2008). Others are changes at the molecular level that might be used to detect early stages of degrada-tion. The popularly used characteristics of common plastics are as follows:
(a) decrease in average molecular weight of the plastic. This is conveniently 
measured using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and also using solu-tion (or melt) viscosity
(b) loss in bulk mechanical properties of the plastic, such as the tensile properties, compression properties or the impact properties
(c) loss in surface properties of the material including discoloration, micro-cracking or ‘chalking’ (release of white filler from filled plastic surfaces on weathering)
(d) changes in spectral characteristics that are markers for oxidative degradation or photodegradation. For polyolefins, the relative intensity of the carbonyl absorption band (in the Fourier transformed infra-red or the FTIR spectrum), which increases in percent crystallinity or level of unsaturation, might be monitored.Table 3.2  The common classes of plastics found in ocean debris and those used in fishing gear

3 Persistence of Plastic Litter in the Oceans
3.3.1   Photo-Oxidative Degradation
Photo-oxidation of polyolefin plastics is a free-radical reaction that is initiated by 
solar  UV radiation. The sequence of oxidative chemical reactions involved, results 
in (a) incorporation of oxygen-containing functionalities into the polymer mole -
cules, and (b) scission of long chain-like polymer molecules reducing the num -
ber-average molecular weight of the plastic material. Of these, it is the latter that 
drastically affects the useful properties of the polymer. Even at low levels of oxida -
tion (often a percent or less) very substantial loss in mechanical strength can occur. 
High-energy UV-B (290–315  nm) and medium energy UV-A (315–400  nm) solar 
wavelengths are particularly efficient in facilitating photo-degradation of polymers 
(Andrady 1996 ). However, the fraction of longer wavelength radiation in sunlight 
is very much larger compared to that of the UV radiation and most of the light-
induced damage occurs in the UV-A and/or the visible region of the spectrum.
The approximate region of the solar spectrum that accounts for the most degra -
dation is represented by an activation spectrum. Activation spectra are generated 
in experiments where samples of a plastic are exposed to solar or solar-simulated 
radiation behind a series of cut-on filters that allow only wavelengths higher than a 
cut-on wavelength to be transmitted through them. The degradation rates for sam -
ples behind different filters can be used to construct the activation spectrum (for 
a discussion of the experimental procedures involved in generating such spectra 
see Singh and Sharma 2008 ). Figure  3.1 shows an activation spectrum for yellow -
ing of polycarbonate exposed to solar radiation. It is clear from the figure that the 
UV-A region of sunlight (320–340  nm) causes the greatest damage, despite the 
shorter more energetic wavelengths <320  nm being present in the spectrum. The 
shorter wavelengths account for less than ~5  % of the solar radiation spectrum.
Rates of degra dation are markedly increased at higher ambient temperatures 
as the activation energies for oxidative degradation of common plastics are low

sion from Andrady et  al. (1992 )62 A.L. Andrady
(Hamid and Pritchard 1991 ; Tochác ˇek and Vrátníc ˇková 2014 ). Plastics lying on 
hot sand on beaches undergo faster photo-oxidation relative to those floating on 
water and being, therefore, maintained at a lower temperature. The same phenom -
enon is also responsible for differences in the rates of weathering of differently 
colored plastics. Darker shades of plastics exposed to sunlight tend to absorb more 
of the infrared energy in the solar spectrum, reaching higher sample temperatures. 
Consequently, they weather faster relative to lighter colored plastics. A particularly 
good measure of degradation in plastics is tensile extensibility. Figure  3.2 shows 
the effect of sample temperature on the loss in tensile extensibility of polyethylene 
film samples exposed in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. One set of samples was exposed 
at ambient temperature of 26–36  °C. Another set of samples was maintained at 
a constant temperature of 25  °C. At different durations of exposure the samples 
(typically dumbbell-shaped pieces) were removed periodically for testing. In this 
test the dumbbell shaped sample (5–6 in. long) is held at its ends in a pair of grips 
and pulled along its long axis at a constant speed of 500  mm/min. The sample first 
extends and then snaps. The ratio of the grip separation at the point the sample 
snaps to that at the start of the extension, expressed as a percentage, is the extensi -
bility or ultimate strain of the sample.
3.3.2   Mechanisms of Photo-Oxidation
The basic mechanism of light-induced degradation for the two plastics used in 
highest volume and therefore most numerous in marine debris, PE and PP, is well 
known. It is a free-radical reaction initiated by UV radiation or heat and propa -
gated via hydrogen abstraction from the polymer. The polymer alkyl radicals 
formed react with oxygen to yield peroxy radicals, ROO• , that are converted to 
a peroxide moiety by hydrogen abstraction. As peroxide products can themselves Fig. 3.2  Change in

dissociate readily into radicals, the reaction sequence is autocatalytic. The main 
reactions involved in the sequence are as follows (François-Heude et al. 2015):
1. Initiation:
2. Propagation:
3. Termination:
From a practical standpoint, it is the chain scission that accompanies this cyclic 
reaction sequence, which is of greater interest. The chain scission event is believed to be associated with one of the propagation reactions and is responsible for the loss in mechanical properties of the plastic material after exposure. Different mechanical properties (such as ultimate extensibility, the tensile modulus, or impact strength) having different functional dependence on the average molecular weight will change at different rates with the duration of exposure. There is, thus, no ‘general’ weathering curve for a given polymer but only for specific modes of damage of the polymer material under exposure to a specified light source such as sunlight or radiation from a xenon lamp. Chain scission is often directly estimated from gel permeation chromatography. Being associated with the number of propa-gation cycles it can also be correlated with the products of the chemical reactions, especially the accumulation of carbonyl compounds {>C=O}. This is often moni-tored using the relative intensity of the relevant bands in the FTIR spectrum of the polymer and has been demonstrated to correlate well with the ultimate extensibil-ity of the sample (Andrady et al. 1993).
Other reactions that contribute to changes in the useful properties of plastics 
following exposure to solar radiation are also evident with common plastics. Yellowing discoloration of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) is an example of such a reaction. This is a light-induced de-hydrochlorination reaction that generates short sequences of conjugated unsaturation in the polymer (Andrady et al. 1989):
These absorb on the blue region and make the plastic appear yellow. However, 
polyolefins (both PE and PP) as well as PS also yellow on exposure to sunlight but the mechanism of such yellowing and the identity of the species involved are RH→Free radicals, ex., R •,H•

not well known. Polycarbonate (PC) plastic used in glazing applications is another 
example of a material that undergoes yellowing under exposure to sunlight. The 
main photodegradation reaction of PC, however, is a rearrangement reaction (Fries 
reaction) with no change in spectral qualities (Factor et  al. 1987 ):
A second reaction that yields yellow oxidation products also occurs along with 
it, however, the mechanistic details of the second reaction are unknown.
3.3.3   Weathering Under Marine Conditions
While the main agencies involved and the mechanisms of weathering in the 
marine environment are the same as those on land environments, the rates at 
which weathering proceeds can be significantly slower in the former (Pegram and 
Andrady 1989 ). To better understand the differences, the marine environment must 
be regarded in separate zones: the beach environment, the surface water environ -
ment, and the deep water/benthic environment. The availability of weathering 
agencies in these are different as summarized in Table  3.3.
Availability of sunlight to initiate the degradation reactions is restricted in the 
case of floating plastics because of bio-fouling of their surface in seawater. Initial

3 Persistence of Plastic Litter in the Oceans
exposure of the plastic results in the formation of a surface biofilm (Lobelle and 
Cunliffe 2011) that is rapidly colonized by algae and other marine biota includ-
ing encrusting organisms that increase the density of the plastic causing it to sink in seawater (Thangavelu et al. 2011). The plastic particles that sink due to this process may re-emerge at a later time once the foulants are foraged by marine consumers and the plastic decreases in density (Ye and Andrady 1991). Fouling shields the surface of plastic from exposure to sunlight interfering with the ini-tiation of the oxidation process. This is a significant reason for the retardation of weathering degradation in plastics floating in seawater (Pegram and Andrady 1989). Also, attenuation of solar UV radiation in seawater is very rapid and light-induced initiation reactions cannot occur at depths beyond the photic zone.
The primary reason for the retardation of weathering degradation in floating 
samples is the relatively lower sample temperatures. In contact with a good heat sink (i.e. seawater), the samples do not undergo heat build up and reach high tem-peratures as in the case of samples exposed on land. The combined effect of these factors in retarding degradation is illustrated in Fig. 3.3 that compares the loss in extensibility of polypropylene exposed in Biscayne Bay, FL, floating in water and on land during the same period. This observation of retardation of the weather -
ing at sea is generally true for all common plastic materials. With expanded pol-ystyrene foam (EPS) plasticization by water and wave action result in the foam breaking up readily into individual beads of the polymer. However, the weathering degradation of these beads is a slow process.
Initial stages of oxidative breakdown of the plastic materials result in a marked 
decrease in their mechanical properties. However, the high-polymer nature persists even at extensive degradation where the mechanical integrity of the plastic mate-rial is fully compromised. Andrady (2011) as well as Klemchuk and Horng (1984) have demonstrated that for polyethylenes weathered even to the point of embrittle-ment with no extensibility of the material, the average molecular weights persisted in the 10s of thousands g/mole. These will likely not be further photodegraded so

that, being fouled or submerged in water, slow biodegradation is the only feasible 
mechanism for their removal from the environment.
Plastic debris in the ocean generally accumulates a biofilm that contains numer -
ous diverse microorganisms (Ho et al. 1999). Such marine biota can secrete enzymes that can biodegrade common plastics such as polyethylenes as evidenced by surface depressions and pits caused by these on the plastic debris (Zettler et al. 2013). But, the relevant species are rare and the kinetics of biodegradation at sea is particularly slow. While strictly speaking, plastics do biodegrade at sea due to the action of marine organisms, however, the rate of the process is far too slow to either remove plastic debris from the environment or even to obtain obvious decreases in mechanical integrity attributable solely to this process. The excep-tions are those plastics, such as aliphatic polyesters, that have structural features that allow facile biodegradation (Kita et al. 1997; Sudhakar et al. 2007) by a host of microorganisms present in the ocean. Biodegradation converts the carbon sequestered in the plastic to carbon dioxide (Narayan 2006). With a simple sub-strate such as glucose, the products depend on whether the process is aerobic or anaerobic (Tokiwa et al. 2009):
Aerobic biodegradation:
Anaerobic biodegradation:
Most of the common plastics are hydrocarbons and the stoichiometry will be dif-
ferent from above (Shimao 2001).
3.4  Microplastics in the Oceans
An emerging pollutant of concern in the marine environment is microplastic mate-rial or plastic fragments of a size-range that allows their interaction with marine plankton (Cole et al. 2011). Their presence in surface water (Barnes et al. 2009; Song et al. 2014), beaches and sediment (Katsanevakis et al. 2007) has been reported from many parts of the world, including even the Arctic (Obbard et al. 2014). Additionally, microplastics have been reported in estuaries and freshwater bodies (Lima et al. 2014).
Many different definitions of the size scale that constitute ‘microplastics’ 
are reported in the research literature (Gregory and Andrady 2003; Betts 2008; Fendall and Sewell 2009). But there is growing consensus for categorizing micro-plastics as being <1 mm and >1 µm with the larger fragments that include vir -
gin resin pellets being called ‘mesoplastics’. Most of the studies that document the existence of plastic debris in the world’s oceans focus almost exclusively on C6H12O6+6O2→6CO 2+6H2O/Delta1G=−2870 kJ/mol
C6H12O6→3CO 2+3CH 4/Delta1G=−390 kJ/mol67
3 Persistence of Plastic Litter in the Oceans
mesoplastics and larger pieces. Studies on true microplastics (<1 mm fraction) are 
rare because identification and quantification of the microscopic particles is chal-lenging (Löder and Gerdts 2015). Plankton nets used to sample surface waters have a mesh size of ~330 microns and collect the mesoplastics. A majority of the literature, however, uses the term ‘microplastics’ loosely to mean both meso- and micro-scale particles. A clear definition of the particle sizes is important because it is the particle-size distribution that determines the set of marine organisms that are able to interact, particularly ingest, the microdebris. For instance, microplastics (as well as nanoplastics) are ingestible by zooplankton (Frias et al. 2014) at the bot-tom of the food pyramid while the mesoplastics including virgin plastic pellets are found in species such as dolphins (Di Beneditto and Ramos 2014).
While virgin plastics such as the prils used in manufacturing plastic products are 
generally non-toxic and not digestible by any marine organism, large fragments may cause distress due to physical obstruction of the gut or filter appendages (Kühn et al. 2015). The main concern, however, is that microplastics concentrate persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in seawater via partition. The distribution coefficients for organic compounds including POPs range in the 10
4–106. Their ingestion by marine organisms 
provides a credible pathway to transfer the environmental pollutants dissolved in water into the marine food web. Therefore, relatively low mass fractions of the microplas-tics can transport a disproportionately high dose of POPs into an ingesting organism. Where the organism is small as with zooplanktons (Frias et al. 2014; Lima et al. 2014), assuming high bioavailability, the body burden of the POPs that might be released into the organism can be significant. This is a particular concern as it involves the lower echelons of the marine food web, where any adverse impact may affect the entire food chain and potentially the global fish supply (Betts 2008). Others have suggested that this transfer pathway is likely of limited importance under equilibrium conditions (Gouin et al. 2011; Koelmans et al. 2013, 2014). At least in the lugworm Arenicola 
marina, conservative modeling suggests that the transfer of POPs (Bisphenol A and nonylphenol) from microplastics into the organism yields concentrations below the global environmental concentration of these chemicals (Koelmans et al. 2014).
The origins of meso-, micro- and nano-plastics in the oceans are attributed to either 
products that incorporate such particles (such as cosmetics, sandblasting media, virgin pellets) or to the weathering degradation of larger plastic debris in the marine environ-ment (Thompson 2015). In the former instance they are referred to as primary micro-particles being introduced into the ocean already as micro-debris while in the latter case they are generated in the ocean environment from macro-debris. As already pointed out (Table 3.3), where microplastics are derived from larger plastic litter, the process occurs particularly efficiently on beaches and least efficiently in deep water or sediment.
While weathering related oxidative mechanisms for polyolefins (PE and PP) are 
well known (Ojeda 2011), the concurrent embrittlement of the material has not been adequately studied. This is to be expected as material scientists have little interest in the weathering process beyond the point at which the material has lost its use-ful properties; embrittlement, however, occurs after this stage. It is the embrittlement phenomenon that is particularly interesting as it has the potential to generate micro-plastics. Associated with the oxidation reactions described in the previous section 68 A.L. Andrady
is an autocatalytic chain scission reaction. This is easily demonstrated by monitor -
ing the change in average molecular weight of the plastic during weathering [for 
instance by gel permeation chromatography (GPC)] (Ojeda 2011). For instance, with PP exposed to UV radiation in an accelerated laboratory weathering experiment the molecular weight of the polymer at the surface of a test piece decreased by 51 % in six weeks of exposure (O’Donnell et al. 1994). At greater depths of a sample, the effect is less pronounced for two reasons: the attenuation of UV radiation with depth that restricts the initiation reaction and the limitation of the reaction due to slow dif-fusion of oxygen at greater depths.
Chain scission occurs exclusively in the amorphous fraction of semi-crystalline 
polymers and that, too, preferentially in the surface layer that is several hundred microns in thickness. This can, in theory, lead to two types of fracture: (a) the bulk fracture and (b) surface layer removal due to stresses on highly weathered sam-ples. The former results in a sample such as virgin prils being fragmented gradu-ally into several daughter particles. The latter results in a large number of particles

derived from the surface layer with particle size, at least in one dimension, equal 
to the thickness of that layer. Possibly both modes of fragmentation occur in natu -
ral weathering of plastics on beaches or in seawater.
Plastic samples collected from beach or surface water environments show sur -
face patterns consistent with surface erosion and cracking due to weathering. The 
cracks and pits on the surface of PE and PP samples from the ocean environment 
are similar to those seen on samples exposed to weathering (or UV radiation) in 
the laboratory. It is reasonable to expect that it is this fragmentation process that 
yields derived microplastics in the ocean environment. The early evolution of sur -
face damage from exposure to UV radiation can be easily discerned from atomic 
force microscopy (AFM) of the surface. Figure  3.4 shows the changes on an epoxy 
primer coating, exposed to UV radiation and/or salt fog. These micro-cracks prop -
agate in time to form surface features that are easily visible under a low-power 
microscope. The cracks appear first on the edges and propagate towards the center 
of sample surface. The evolution of surface cracks under exposure to UV light 
has been reported for HDPE (Shimao 2001 ), LDPE (Cole et  al. 2011 ) and PP 
(Yakimets et  al. 2004 ). Some of the plastic samples collected from beaches as well 
as from surface waters in the ocean have extensive yellowing and cracking (Ogata 
et al. 2009 ; Cooper and Corcoran 2010 ). Figure  3.5 shows micrographs that illus -
trate this phenomenon.

3.5  Conclusions
The degradation mechanisms, pathways and kinetic expressions are well-estab-
lished in the literature. Detailed information is available particularly on the plas-tics used in high volume such as PE and PP. However, these studies either do not progress beyond the weakening of the plastic material to a point it cannot be used or the fragmentation process has not been investigated. Hitherto, there has been little interest in studying the fragmentation process or the changes in the ensuing particle size distribution of the plastics. With growing interest in microplastics in the ocean this aspect of polymer degradation will receive more attention.

M. Bergmann et al. (eds.), Marine Anthropogenic Litter,  DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-16510-3_4Abstract In this review we report new findings concerning interaction between 
marine debris and wildlife. Deleterious effects and consequences of entangle-
ment, consumption and smothering are highlighted and discussed. The number of species known to have been affected by either entanglement or ingestion of plas-tic debris has doubled since 1997, from 267 to 557 species among all groups of wildlife. For marine turtles the number of affected species increased from 86 to 100 % (now 7 of 7 species), for marine mammals from 43 to 66 % (now 81 of 123 species) and for seabirds from 44 to 50 % of species (now 203 of 406 spe-
cies). Strong increases in records were also listed for fish and invertebrates, groups that were previously not considered in detail. In future records of interac-tions between marine debris and wildlife we recommend to focus on standardized data on frequency of occurrence and quantities of debris ingested. In combination with dedicated impact studies in the wild or experiments, this will allow more detailed assessments of the deleterious effects of marine debris on individuals and populations.

4.1  Introduction
For several decades, it has been known that anthropogenic debris in the marine 
environment, in particular plastic, affects marine organisms (Shomura and Yoshida 1985; Laist 1997; Derraik 2002; Katsanevakis 2008). Plastic production grows at 5 % per year (Andrady and Neal 2009). Part of the material ends up as litter in the marine environment, to such an extent that the issue is considered to be of major global concern (UNEP 2011). Awareness has grown that plastics may become less visible but do not really disappear as they become fragmented into small persis-tent particles (‘plastic soup’) (Andrady 2015). Plastic fragmentation can be caused by abiotic factors (Andrady 2011) or through animal digestion processes (Van 
Franeker et al. 2011). The smaller the particle, the higher the availability to ani-mals at the base of the food chain. The potential deleterious effects from inges-tion, have heightened the urgency to evaluate the impact of plastics on the whole marine food chain and, ultimately, the consequences for humans as end consumers (Koch and Calafat 2009; UNEP 2011; Galloway 2015).
The most visible effect of plastic pollution on marine organisms concerns wildlife 
entanglement in marine debris, often in discarded or lost fishing gear and ropes (Laist 1997; Baulch and Perry 2014). Entangled biota are hindered in their ability to move, feed and breathe. In addition, many marine organisms mistake litter for food and ingest it (Day et al. 1985; Laist 1997). Indigestible debris such as plastics may accumulate in their stomachs and affect individual fitness, with consequences for reproduction and survival, even if not causing direct mortality (Van Franeker 1985; Bjorndal et al. 1994; McCauley and Bjorndal 1999). Marine birds, turtles and mammals have received 
most attention, but the consequences of entanglement and ingestion on other organism groups, e.g. fish and invertebrates, are becoming more evident. In addition to the issues of entanglement and ingestion, synthetic materials represent a long-lived substrate that may present the possibility of transporting hitch-hiking ‘alien’ species horizontally to ecosystems elsewhere (for more details see Kiessling et al. 2015) or vertically from the sea surface through the water column to the seafloor. Plastics may also smother water surfaces and sea bottoms where effects may range from suffocating organisms (e.g. Mordecai et al. 2011; Green et al. 2015) to offering new habitats for species that are oth-
erwise unable to settle (e.g. Chapman and Clynick 2006).
Major reviews of the impacts of litter, in particular plastics, on marine life have 
been undertaken by Shomura and Yoshida (1985), Laist (1997), Derraik (2002) and Katsanevakis (2008). We used the species list of Laist (1997) as a basis for our work and conducted an extensive literature review to add not only birds and mammals, but also fish and invertebrates. Laist (1997) tabulated data on both entanglement and ingestion but focused discussions on the entanglement aspect. Therefore, we paid more attention to descriptions and discussion of the ingestion issue. This includes occurrence of smaller plastics in smaller organisms, including invertebrates but leaves the real microplastic issues to the dedicated chapter in this book (Lusher 2015). The table with species listings for ingestion and entanglement starts with marine birds and mammals because for these animal groups, literature 77
4 Deleterious Effects of Litter on Marine Life
coverage is far more complete than for lower taxonomic groups, and because this 
is directly comparable with Laist (1997). Further taxonomic groups are in tradi-tional taxonomic sequence.
Tables 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 summarise our findings on entanglement and ingestion 
for groups of species in comparison to the earlier review by Laist (1997). Table 4.4 
gives a more specific overview of our findings, but all details for individual  species 
and data sources are provided in our Online Supplement. Data in our tables only relate to observations on wild organisms. This excludes for example fisheries  by-catch data for active fishing gear and laboratory experiments. Texts refer to 
these only where it does not overlap too much with the microplastics chapters in this book and the review by Cole et al. (2011). The main aim of our paper was to compile a factual overview of known records of interference of plastic debris with marine wildlife as a basis for current discussions and future work addressing the scale of impact and policies to be developed.
4.2  Entanglement
Entanglement of marine life occurs all over the world, from whales in the Arctic (Knowlton et al. 2012) and fur seals in the Southern Ocean (Waluda and Staniland 2013), to gannets in Spain (Rodríguez et al. 2013), octopuses in Japan (Matsuoka et al. 2005) and crabs in Virginia, USA (Bilkovic et al. 2014). One of the first entanglement records of marine debris was probably a shark, caught in a rubber automobile tyre in 1931 (Gudger and Hoffman 1931). Hundreds of thousands of marine birds and mammals are known to perish in active fishing gear (Read et al. 2006; Žydelis et al. 2013), but no estimates are available for the actual num-ber of animals becoming entangled in synthetic fisheries debris and other litter. However, from species records in Table 4.1 and the Online Supplement, it appears that the problem is substantial. The percentage of species that have been recorded as entangled among various groups of marine organisms, is high: 100 % of marine turtles (7 of 7 species), 67 % of seals (22 of 33 species), 31 % of whales (25 of 80 species) and 25 % of seabirds (103 of 406). In comparison to the listings by Laist (1997) the number of bird + turtle + mammal species with known entan-glement increased from 89 (21 %) to 161 (30 %) (Table 4.1). For other reptiles, fish and invertebrates the percentage of affected species is futile because there are many thousands of species which have not been properly investigated. Often it is considered less worthwhile to publish individual entanglement records for com-mon fishes or invertebrates or inconspicuous small species, than, for example, for a large entangled whale washed ashore.
Temporal entanglement trends are difficult to establish, as they differ between 
species groups and population changes play an important role (Ryan et al. 2009). Fowler et al. (1992) found a decline in entanglement of northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) from 1975 to 1992. In Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella), Waluda and Staniland (2013) reported a peak in 1994 and then a decrease 78 S. Kühn et al.
until 2012. In the same period of time (1978–2000), Cliff et al. (2002) found an 
increase in entanglement rates of dusky sharks (Carcharhinus obscurus).
4.2.1  Ways of Entanglement
The term “ghost fishing” has been established for lost or abandoned fishing gear (Breen 1990). Ghost nets may continue to trap and kill organisms and can damage 
benthic habitats (Pawson 2003; Good et al. 2010). Important factors, increasing Table 4.1  Number of species with documented records of entanglement in marine debris
Comparative summary with the earlier major review by Laist (1997). Individual species and sources 
are documented in the Online Supplement. Observations only concern dead or living animals entan-gled in marine debris including derelict fishing gear. Between the two reviews, the number of spe-cies, in the groups considered, differ because of changes in accepted taxonomic status, and selection of which species groups should be considered to be ‘marine’.

the risks of entanglement, are the size and structure (Sancho et al. 2003) of the 
lost nets and their location. For example, nets that are stretched open by struc-tures on the sea bed, tend to catch more organisms (Good et al. 2010). The esti-mated time, over which lost fishing gear continues to entangle and kill organisms varies substantially and is site and gear specific (Kaiser et al. 1996; Erzini 1997; Hébert et al. 2001; Humborstad et al. 2003; Revill and Dunlin 2003; Sancho et al. 2003; Tschernij and Larsson 2003; Matsuoka et al. 2005; Erzini et al. 2008; Newman et al. 2011). Matsuoka et al. (2005) estimated catch durations of derelict 
gill- and trammel-nets from different studies between 30 and 568 days. Ghost-fishing efficiency can sometimes decrease exponentially (Erzini 1997; Tschernij 
and Larsson 2003; Ayaz et al. 2006; Baeta et al. 2009). For example, Tschernij and Larsson (2003) found 80 % of the catch in bottom gill nets in the Baltic Sea during the first three months. Still, the nets continued fishing at a low rate until the end of the experiment after 27 months. Lost fishing gear can carry on trap-ping, until it is heavily colonised, altering weight, mesh size and visibility (Erzini 1997; Humborstad et al. 2003; Sancho et al. 2003). In deeper waters, ghost fishing seems to continue for longer periods of time, as fouling takes longer (Breen 1990; Humborstad et al. 2003; Large et al. 2009). A reduction of the duration of ghost fishing by using degradable materials unfortunately also affects the operational lifetime of equipment. However, easily replaced degradable escape cords in lobster traps may reduce ghost fishing of lost traps efficiently (Antonelis et al. 2011).
In addition to entanglement in derelict fishing gear, other anthropogenic 
material such as ropes, balloons, plastic bags, sheets and six-pack drink hold-ers can cause entanglement (e.g. Plotkin and Amos 1990; Norman et al. 1995; Camphuysen 2001; Matsuoka et al. 2005; Gomerc ˇic ´ et al. 2009; V otier et al. 2011; 
Bond et al. 2012; Moore et al. 2009, 2013; Rodríguez et al. 2013).
Whales and dolphins tend to become entangled around their neck, flippers and 
flukes, often in several types of fishing gear (Moore et al. 2013; Van der Hoop et al. 2013). Seals become frequently entangled in synthetic fishing gear, packing straps or other loop-shaped items that encircle the neck at young age and create prob-lems during growth (Fowler 1987; Lucas 1992; Allen et al. 2012) (see Fig. 4.2). Seabirds are well known to become entangled around the bill, wings and feet with rope-like materials, which constrains their ability to fly or forage properly (Camphuysen 2001; Rodríguez et al. 2013) (Fig. 4.1). In addition to entanglement 
in fishing gear and other debris (Bugoni et al. 2001) marine turtles face problems on beaches where hatchlings are prone to entanglement or entrapment in marine debris on their way to the sea (Kasparek 1995; Ozdilek et al. 2006; Triessing et al. 2012). Motile benthic organisms become primarily caught in derelict traps on the seafloor (Adey et al. 2008; Erzini et al. 2008; Antonelis et al. 2011; Anderson and 
Alford 2014; Bilkovic et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2014; Uhrin et al. 2014) (Fig. 4.3a) 
although sometimes escape has also been observed (Parrish and Kazama 1992; Godøy et al. 2003). If there is no possibility of escape, animals in these traps and pots die from starvation (Pecci et al. 1978) and serve as bait, which attracts new victims (Kaiser et al. 1996; Stevens et al. 2000; Hébert et al. 2001).80 S. Kühn et al.
Behavioural traits can be important factors in becoming entangled 
(Shaughnessy 1985; Woodley and Lavigne 1991). It has been suggested that 
sharks become entangled when investigating large floating items and when search-
ing for food associated with clumps of lost fishing gear (Bird 1978). Prey fish, which use debris as a shelter, can increase entanglement risks for predators, such as sharks (Cliff et al. 2002) and fish (Tschernij and Larsson 2003). The ‘playful’ behaviour of marine mammals may increase the risk of entanglement (Mattlin and Cawthorn 1986; Laist 1987; Harcourt et al. 1994; Zavala-González and Mellink 
1997; Hanni and Pyle 2000; Page et al. 2004). Zavala-González and Mellink (1997) and Hanni and Pyle (2000) explained a higher incidence of entanglement

in younger California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) by playful behaviour and 
curiosity in combination with lack of experience and a foraging habit closer to the water surface. Age plays a significant role in pinnipeds, as younger seals are more often entangled than adults (Lucas 1992; Henderson 2001; Hofmeyr et al. 2006).
Gannets and many other seabird species use seaweed to build their nests, but are 
known to frequently incorporate ropes, nets and other anthropogenic debris (Podolski and Kress 1989; Montevecchi 1991; Hartwig et al. 2007; V otier et al. 2011; Bond et al. 2012; Lavers et al. 2013; Verlis et al. 2014) (Fig. 4.1). Marine debris used in nest construction increases the risk of mortal entanglement for both adult birds and chicks (Fig. 4.1). In three of the six North American gannet populations, close to 75 % of the gannet nests contained fishing debris. Its frequency can be linked to the level of gillnet fishing effort in the waters around the colonies (Bond et al. 2012).

4.2.2  Effects of Entanglement
Entangled organisms may no longer be able to acquire food and avoid predators, 
or become so exhausted that they starve or drown (Laist 1997). Even if the organ-ism does not die directly, wounds, restricted movements and reduced foraging ability will seriously affect the entangled animal (Arnould and Croxall 1995; Laist 1997; Moore et al. 2009; Allen et al. 2012). In turtles, entanglement is known to cause skin infections, amputations of legs and septic processes (Orós et al. 2005; Barreiros and Raykov 2014). Barreiros and Guerreiro (2014) reported a ring from

a plastic bottle that became fixed around the operculum of a juvenile axillary sea 
bream (Pagellus acarne), which inflicted a deep cut in the anterior part of the fish and caused mortality. Discarded plastic lines and fishing gear, even if not directly drowning the animal, may cause complications in proper foraging or surfacing to breathe (Wabnitz and Nichols 2010). Illustrating the fact that such events may affect even unlikely species, the entanglement of a sea snake (Hydrophis elegans) in a ceramic ring caused starvation by restricting the passage of food (Udyawer et al. 2013).
In sharks, plastic entanglement reduced the mouth opening so as to impair for -
aging and gill ventilation (Sazima et al. 2002). A malformation of the backbone 
due to long-term entanglement of a shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus) dis-turbed natural growth. In addition, biofouling on the rope probably reduced its swimming efficiency, maximum velocity and manoeuvrability (Wegner and Cartamil 2012). Lucas (1992) discovered a dead grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) 
with deformations. The size of the rubber trawl roller suggested that it had been entangled as a juvenile five years before.
Crabs, octopuses, fishes and a wide range of smaller marine biota are known 
to get caught in derelict traps on the seafloor and die from stress, injuries or star -
vation, as escape is difficult (Matsuoka 1999; Al-Masroori et al. 2004; Matsuoka et al. 2005; Erzini et al. 2008; Antonelis et al. 2011; Cho 2011). Derelict fishing lines and other gear are often covering structurally complex biota such as sponges, gorgonians (Fig. 4.3b) or (soft) corals (Pham et al. 2013; Smith and Edgar 2014) which suffer broken parts and may be more susceptible to infections and eventu-ally die, as shown for shallow-water (soft) corals and gorgonians (Bavestrello et al. 1997; Schleyer and Tomalin 2000; Asoh et al. 2004; Yoshikawa and Asoh 2004; 
Chiappone et al. 2005). Contact with soft plastic litter also caused necrosis in the cold water coral Lophelia pertusa (Fabri et al. 2014).
Although examples of entanglement and various pathways of negative effects 
on individuals are abundant, it is rarely possible to assess the proportional dam-age to populations. However, Knowlton et al. (2012) reported that among a known number of 626 photo-identified individuals of the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), 83 % showed evidence of entanglements in ropes and nets. On average, 26 % of adequately photographed animals acquired new wounds or scars every year. Allen et al. (2012) showed that entanglement reduces the longer-term survival of grey seals significantly. Studies like these, although not attribut-able with certainty to marine debris alone, do show that entanglement, although not directly obvious, can have a serious impact on wild populations.
4.3  Smothering
Marine debris on the seabed can have various effects on the resident flora and fauna that we do not consider to be ‘entanglement’ but rather describe as ‘smother -
ing’. Smith (2012) suggested that large quantities of litter may impede attempts 84 S. Kühn et al.
to rehabilitate depleted mangrove forests in Papua New Guinea through smother -
ing of seedlings. In the intertidal zone the weight and shading effects of debris 
may crush sensitive salt marsh vegetation or reduce light levels needed for growth, which can lead to denuded areas in these sensitive protected ecosystems (Uhrin and Schellinger 2011; Viehman et al. 2011). Two species of seagrass (Thalassia 
testudinum, Syringodium filiforme) had significantly decreased shoot densities 
after experimental deployment of traps on the sea bed (Uhrin et al. 2005). The weight of the traps caused blades to become abraded or crushed into the underly-ing anoxic sediments, likely suffocating the plants, reducing photosynthetic rates 
and leading to eventual senescence of above-ground biomass (Uhrin et al. 2005), which indicates long-lasting effects on ecosystem function and thus biodiversity of these vulnerable habitats.
Estimates on the impact of marine debris on local populations are available for 
corals: for example, Richards and Beger (2011) found that coral cover decreased significantly as macrodebris cover increased. Yoshikawa and Asoh (2004) reported that 65 % of coral colonies in Oahu, Hawaii were covered with fishing lines, and 80 % of colonies were either entirely or partially dead, which was, again, posi-tively correlated with the percentage of colonies covered with fishing lines.
On one hand some debris may provide shelter for motile animals, and a habitat for 
sessile organisms, as was experimentally shown by Katsanevakis et al. (2007) and in the deep sea (Mordecai et al. 2011; Schlining et al. 2013). In the Majuro Lagoon, the coral Porites rus overgrew debris and appeared to thrive in locations of high debris 
cover (Richards and Beger 2011). On the other hand, derelict fishing gear, bags and large (agricultural) foils are known to cover parts of the seafloor at all depths (e.g. Galgani et al. 1996; Watters et al. 2010; Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013; Pham et al. 2014) (Fig. 4.3e). Mordecai et al. (2011) reported anoxic sediments below a plastic bag on the deep seafloor of the Nazaré Canyon and suggested that this would alter the infaunal community underneath as it reduces the exchange of pore water with overly-ing water masses. Indeed, anoxic sediments, reduced primary productivity and organic matter and significantly lower abundances of infaunal invertebrates were recently recorded below plastic bags experimentally deployed on a beach.for 9 weeks (Green et al. 2015). Anoxic sediments below marine litter were also observed at two sites of a 
mangrove habitat from Papua New Guinea (Smith 2012). Dragged along the seafloor litter may cause further damage to fragile habitat engineers (coral, plants) and change biogeochemical seafloor properties (e.g. Fig. 4.3f). Macroplastics covering larger parts of corals, cannot only cause direct mechanical damage, but also diminish the capacity of phototrophic and heterotrophic nutrition (Richards and Beger 2011) (see also Fig. 4.3b, 
d). Also, a relationship between marine debris and coral diseases has been observed (Harrison et al. 2011). When corals die and release the debris, it moves on to a new spot and repeats the negative cycle (Donohue et al. 2001; Chiappone et al. 2005; Abu-Hilal 
and Al-Najjar 2009). In eastern Indonesian areas experimentally smothered by plastic, 
diatom densities were lower, probably due to the lack of light. However, meiofauna had a higher density beneath smothered test sites than on clean control sites, which was explained by the temporarily decomposing organic matter improving habitat quality for meiofauna (Uneputty and Evans 2009). Smothering may also limit the nutrition of filter 85
4 Deleterious Effects of Litter on Marine Life
feeders as it may restrict water circulation and thereby particles reaching the feeding 
apparatus (see Fig. 4.3b, c, d). In addition, marine debris on beaches can have negative 
effects on marine biota. Kasparek (1995) found marine turtle nesting sites on beaches in Syria, where the beaches were so polluted that females might not be able to dig a nest at an appropriate site. Litter may also lead to behavioural changes: for example, prolonged food searching time and increased self-burial in intertidal snails (Nassarius pullus) is strongly correlated with increased plastic cover, which was also reflected in low snail densities in areas of high litter cover (Aloy et al. 2011). Twenty-two taxa that are affected by smothering with litter are listed in Online Supplement 2 (provided by M. Bergmann) including four grasses, two types of sponges, 14 cnidarian species and one mollusc and crustacean.
4.4  Ingestion of Plastic
Ingestion of plastic by marine organisms is less visible than entanglement. Table 4.2 and Online Supplement 1 show that ingestion of plastic debris has cur -
rently been documented for 100 % of marine turtles (7 of 7 species), 59 % of whales (47 of 80), 36 % of seals (12 of 33), and 40 % of seabirds (164 of 406). In 
comparison to the review by Laist (1997) the number of bird + turtle + mammal species with known ingestion of plastics increased from 143 (33 %) to 233 (44 %). Studies on the ingestion of plastics by fish and invertebrates are largely a recent development. Currently, low proportions of fish and invertebrate species are pre-sented in the tables, but a rapid increase in publications and species numbers are expected in this currently dynamic field of research. Records of plastic ingestion date back to the early days of plastic production in the 1960s. One of the first birds recorded to contain plastic was Leach’s storm petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) off New Foundland in 1962 (Rothstein 1973). The first report of a leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) with plastic dates back to 1968 (Mrosovsky et al. 2009). While the first record of anthropogenic debris in sperm whales (Physeter macro-cephalus) was a fish hook found in a stomach in 1895, the first report of ingested plastic in sperm whales dates back to 1979 (de Stephanis et al. 2013). The first 
fish feeding on plastic was published in 1972 (Carpenter et al. 1972). The inges-tion of plastics became a more commonly reported phenomenon from the 1970s onwards (Kenyon and Kridler 1969; Crockett and Reed 1976; Bourne and Imber 1982; Furness 1983; Day et al. 1985). A trend for birds ingesting plastic was prob-ably first noted by Harper and Fowler (1987). Between 1958 and 1959 they found no plastic in prions (Pachyptila spp.) but from then on there was an upward trend in plastic consumption until 1977. A peak of plastic ingestion was detected in 1985 and 1995 in a number of long-term studies (Moser and Lee 1992; Robards et al. 1995; Spear et al. 1995; Mrosovsky et al. 2009; Van Franeker et al. 2011). In contrast to the continuing growth of global plastic use and increase in marine activities, the trend of plastic consumption decreased and stabilized from 2000 onwards approaching the 1980s level (Mrosovsky et al. 2009; Van Franeker et al. 86 S. Kühn et al.
2011; Bond et al. 2013). Figure 4.4 illustrates the ingestion of plastic by northern 
fulmars.
4.4.1  Ways of Plastic Ingestion
Plastics may be ingested intentionally or accidentally and both pathways deserve 
further discussion.Table 4.2  Number of species with documented records of ingestion of marine debris
Comparative summary with the earlier major review by Laist (1997). Individual species and 
sources are documented in Online Supplement. Observations only concern non-simulated dead or living wild animals found in their natural habitat. We thus exclude experimental studies showing the potential for ingestion by marine species. Between the two reviews, the number of species in the groups considered, differ because of changes in accepted taxonomic status, and selection of which species groups should be considered to be ‘marine’.

4 Deleterious Effects of Litter on Marine Life
4.4.1.1  Intentional Ingestion
Why some animals intentionally ingest plastic debris may depend on a range of 
factors, and these may vary among different animal groups. Although many of these factors interact, it is useful to review at least some of them separately.
Foraging Strategy
In seabirds, plastic ingestion has been linked to foraging strategy by several 
authors (e.g. Day et al. 1985; Azzarello and Van Vleet 1987; Ryan 1987; Tourinho 
et al. 2010.) From their study on many different seabird species, Day et al. (1985)

plastic inside (top), fulmars at sea chewing on a plastic fragment (bottom left), stomach content

concluded, that pursuit-diving birds have the highest frequency of plastic uptake, 
followed by surface-seizing and dipping seabirds. Provencher et al. (2010) reported that marine birds, feeding on crustaceans and cephalopods had ingested more plastic than piscivorous seabirds, and those omnivores are most likely to confuse prey and plastic. Seabirds with specialized diets are less likely to misi-dentify plastic, unless a particular type resembles their prey (Ryan 1987). Many gull species frequent rubbish bins and landfill areas, in addition to foraging in marine habitats and seem prone to ingest debris. However, ingested debris does not often show up in their stomachs during dissections because they clear them daily by regurgitating hard prey remains (Hays and Cormons 1974; Ryan and Fraser 1988; Lindborg et al. 2012). As regurgitation takes place regularly, plastics 
quantified from boluses reflect the ingestion of the very last period, rather than accumulated debris (Camphuysen et al. 2008; Ceccarelli 2009; Codina-García et al. 2013; Hong et al. 2013). Tubenosed seabirds mostly retain plastic and hard prey items (Mallory 2006) because they possess two stomachs with a constriction (Isthmus gastris) between the glandular proventriculus and the muscular gizzard (Furness 1985; Ryan and Jackson 1986). Even when spitting stomach oil to defend 
themselves or when feeding their chicks, only plastics from the proventriculus are regurgitated but items from the gizzard are retained (Rothstein 1973). Marine turtles frequently ingest plastic bags as they may mistake them for jellyfish, a common component of their diet (Carr 1987; Lutz 1990; Mrosovsky et al. 2009; Tourinho et al. 2010; Townsend 2011; Campani et al. 2013; Schuyler et al. 2014). 
While accidental plastic ingestion by filter-feeding baleen whales (Mysticeti) might be assumed to be common, Walker and Coe (1990) expected that toothed whales (Odontoceti) would have a low rate of plastic ingestion because they use echolocation or visual cues to locate their prey. However, Laist (1997), Simmonds (2012) and Baulch and Perry (2014) all made extensive descriptions of toothed whales that had ingested plastic. Indeed, our updated literature search showed that 54 and 62 % of the baleen and toothed whales, respectively, ingest plastics. It has also been suggested, that marine mammals could see plastic as a curios-ity and while investigating it, they swallow it or become entrapped (Mattlin and Cawthorn 1986; Laist 1987). Large predatory fishes and birds are known to fre-
quently inspect plastic debris and take bites out of larger plastic items. Cadée (2002) observed that 80 % of foamed plastic debris on the Dutch coast showed 
peckmarks of birds and suggested that the birds mistake polystyrene foam for cut-tlebones or other food. Carson et al. (2013) observed bite marks of sharks or large 
predatory fishes on 16 % of plastic debris beached on Hawaii indicating ‘testing’ of materials. Choy and Drazen (2013) showed that among 595 individuals of seven such large predatory fish species, 19 % of individuals (range per species <1–58 %) had actually ingested plastic. Foraging strategies may vary under different condi-tions of food availability. Duguy et al. (2000) considered that decreased availabil-ity of jellyfish during winter could be the reason for the higher incidence of plastic bags during these months in the diet of turtles.
In conclusion it seems that although indiscriminate omnivorous predators or 
filter feeders appear most prone to plastic ingestion, there are many examples of 89
4 Deleterious Effects of Litter on Marine Life
ingestion among species with specialized foraging techniques and specific prey 
selection.
Color
One of the factors often considered to influence the consumption of marine 
debris is color as specific colors might attract predators when resembling the color of their prey. In seabirds, this has been suggested for e.g. greater shearwa-ters (Puffinus gravis) and red phalaropes (Phalaropus fulicarius) (Moser and Lee 1992). Parakeet auklets (Aethia psittacula) on the Alaskan coast, feeding natu-rally primarily on light-brown crustaceans, consumed mainly darker plastic gran-ules, suggesting they were mistaken for food items (Day et al. 1985). In studies of marine turtles, the issue of color preference is controversial. Lutz (1990) indicated no preferential ingestion of different plastic colors; neither did Campani et al. (2013) in loggerhead turtles. However, others find light-colored and translucent plastics are most commonly ingested, suggesting similarity to their jellyfish prey (Bugoni et al. 2001; Tourinho et al. 2010). Schuyler et al. (2014) indicated such prey-similarity by the combination of translucency and flexibility of plastic bags and found that blue-colored items were less frequently eaten probably because of lower detection rates in open water. An additional visual factor could be shape as floating plastic bags resemble jellyfish. In fur seal scats, the colors of plastic were white, brown, blue, green and yellow (Eriksson and Burton 2003), however, no clear preference was evident.
White, clear, and blue plastics were primarily ingested by planktivorous fish 
from the North Pacific central gyre but similar color proportions were recorded from neuston samples (Boerger et al. 2010). By contrast, black particles were most prevalent in stomachs of fish from the English Channel but this study included both pelagic and demersal fish (Lusher et al. 2013). While two mesopelagic fish 
(Lampris spp.) species did not favour particular colors Alepisaurus ferox seemed to favour white and clear plastic pieces, which may resemble their gelatinous prey (Choy and Drazen 2013). The majority of strands reported from the intestines of Norway lobsters (Nephrops norvegicus) were also transparent (Murray and Cowie 2011).
Studies on the color-specific uptake often do not take into account that color 
may change in the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. Eriksson and Burton 2003). Also, there are rarely quantitative data on the abundance of various color categories in the foraging ranges of the species studied. In general, light colors seem to be most common in floating marine debris ranging from 94 % of the abundance in the Sargasso Sea (Carpenter et al. 1972) and 82–89 % in the South Atlantic (Ryan 1987) to 72 % in the North Pacific (Day et al. 1985). The frequently observed 
prevalence of translucent or brightly colored objects in stomachs may thus reflect the availability of such items the ambient environment rather than color selectivity.90 S. Kühn et al.
Age
Among seabirds, it has been well-established that younger northern fulmars have 
more plastic in their stomachs than adults (Day et al. 1985; Van Franeker et al. 2011). The same has been shown for flesh-footed and short-tailed shearwater (Puffinus carneipes and P . tenuirostris, respectively, Hutton et al. 2008; Acampora 
et al. 2014). The chicks of Laysan albatrosses (Phoebastria immutabilis) at colo-nies (Auman et al. 1997) have a much higher load of plastic than adults at sea (e.g. Gray et al. 2012). In marine turtles, Plotkin and Amos (1990) found a decreasing trend in plastic consumption with age and attributed this to the fact that young tur -
tles linger along drift-lines, where plastic accumulates. However, in the Adriatic Sea no clear age or size-related differences were apparent in loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) (Lazar and Gracan 2011; Campani et al. 2013). Schuyler et al. 
(2013) concludes that turtles ingest most debris during their younger oceanic life 
stages. Significantly higher levels of plastics were recorded in younger francis-cana dolphins (Pontoporia blainvillei) off the Argentinian coast (Denuncio et al. 2011). Younger harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) in the Netherlands had significantly more plastic in their stomach than older ones (Bravo Rebolledo et al. 2013) (illus-trated by Fig. 4.2). There were no differences in the plastic consumption of dif-ferent age classes of cat fishes (Ariidae) from a Brazilian estuary (Possatto et al. 2011). Similarly, there was no relationship between ingested litter mass and sex, maturity and body length in deep-water blackmouth catsharks (Galeus melasto-mus, Anastasopoulou et al. 2013). By contrast, the mean number of plastic items 
ingested by planktivorous fish from the North Pacific gyre increased as the size of fish increased, reaching a maximum of seven pieces per fish for the 7-cm size class (Boerger et al. 2010). However, this may also be explained by higher plastic uptake of larger individuals during the capture process in the codend (Davison and Asch 2011). Larger individuals of the Norway lobster had fewer plastic threads in their intestines indicating higher ingestion rates of smaller/younger animals (Murray and Cowie 2011) that also have higher incidence of infaunal prey such as poly-chaetes (Wieczorek et al. 1999).
In summary, it seems that where age differences were shown, younger animals 
are most affected. The reasons for this are not clear. In seabirds, this could partly be explained by parental delivery of food by regurgitation to chicks at the nest. In such chicks, elevated loads of plastic could be the consequence of being fed by two parents, each transferring much of its own plastic load, which has accumu-lated in the proventricular stomach over an extended period of time before breed-ing. In addition, a less developed grinding action in the gizzards of young birds could slow the mechanical break-down of plastic and removal through the intes-tines. Some species of albatross and shearwater chicks may lose an excess load of plastic by regurgitating proventricular stomach contents prior to fledging (Auman et al. 1997; Hutton et al. 2008). However, in fulmars the high level of plastic per -
sists in immature birds and only gradually disappears after several years (Jensen 2012) and thus cannot be completely explained by parental feeding and stomach functioning. Perhaps, young animals are less efficient at foraging, and therefore 91
4 Deleterious Effects of Litter on Marine Life
less specific in their prey selection (Day et al. 1985; Baird and Hooker 2000; 
Denuncio et al. 2011). One important open question therefore is whether higher 
loads of plastic in younger animals reflect a learning process or mortality of those individuals that ingested too much plastic. Both explanations are speculative, but the latter suggests serious deleterious effects at the population level.
Sex
To date, there is no evidence that sex affects plastic ingestion. Studies that specifi-
cally evaluated male and female ingestion, found no significant differences in the plastic load (e.g. Day et al. 1985; Van Franeker and Meijboom 2002; Lazar and Gracan 2011; Murray and Cowie 2011; Anastasopoulou et al. 2013; Bravo Rebolledo 
et al. 2013). However, species showing strong sexual dimorphy or sex-dependent for -
aging ranges or winter distributions may show sex-specific uptake rates.
4.4.1.2  Accidental and Secondary Ingestion
Filter-feeding marine organisms, ranging in size from small crustaceans, to shell-
fish, fish, some seabirds (prions, Pachyptila spp.) and ultimately large baleen 
whales may be prone to plastic ingestion. These species obtain their nutri-tion by filtering large volumes of water, which may contain debris in addition to the targeted food source. Although non-food items can be ejected before pas-sage into the digestive system, this is not always the case. In their natural habi-tat, ingested plastics have been found in filter-feeding crustaceans such as goose barnacles (Lepas spp.; Goldstein and Goodwin 2013) and mussels (Mytilus edu-lis, Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2012; Leslie et al. 2013; Van Cauwenberghe and Janssen 2014). Large baleen whales have been long known to occasionally ingest 
debris (Laist 1997; Baulch and Perry 2014). In France, a young minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) beached with various plastic bags completely fill-
ing its stomachs (De Pierrepont et al. 2005). Curiously, we have found no record 
of plastic ingestion by obligate filter-feeding large fish such as basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus) or manta ray (Manta birostris). Some bony fish species par -
tially use filter-feeding, but also directional feeding making it difficult to assign the pathway of debris ingestion. Uptake of plastic by filter-feeding fish has been reported for herring (Clupea harengus) and horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) from the North Sea and English Channel (Foekema et al. 2013; Lusher et al. 2013).
Accidental ingestion of a mixture of food and debris is not restricted to fil-
ter feeders. In the Clyde Sea, 83 % of Norway lobsters (Nephrops norvegicus) had plastic in their stomach, which was attributed either to passive ingestion of sedi-ment while feeding or to secondary ingestion (Murray and Cowie 2011), although it could be argued that the fibres ingested may resemble benthic polychaete prey. Plastics and other non-food items found in stomachs of harbour seals in the Netherlands were considered to have been accidentally ingested when catching 92 S. Kühn et al.
prey fishes (Bravo Rebolledo et al. 2013). A similar route for plastic ingestion was 
proposed by Di Beneditto and Ramos (2014), who showed that plastic in fran-ciscana dolphins was related to benthic feeding habits, in which disturbance of sediment probably induced accidental intake of plastic debris. Florida manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) may take up plastic accidentally during foraging on plants (Beck and Barros 1991). Pelagic loggerhead sea turtles may ingest plas-tic because they feed indiscriminately or graze on organisms settled on floating plastic (McCauley and Bjorndal 1999; Tomas et al. 2002). A special case of such accidental ingestion is known for the Laysan albatross who take up plastic parti-cles in combination with eggs strings of flying fish. The fishes attach their eggs to floating items: previously seaweed, bits of wood or pumice, but nowadays often plastic objects (Pettit et al. 1981). This phenomenon has also been observed in log-gerhead turtles. The plastic in their stomachs was sometimes covered by the eggs of the insect Halobates micans (Frick et al. 2009).
A final case of unintentional plastic ingestion is that of secondary ingestion, 
which occurs when animals feed on prey, which had already ingested debris. This may concern both prey swallowed as a whole or scavenging. In seabirds, skuas are known to forage on smaller seabirds that consume plastic (Ryan 1987). Great skuas (Stercorarius skua) from the South Atlantic Ocean predate several seabird species, and their regurgitated boluses showed a link with the amount of second-arily ingested plastic and their main prey species (Bourne and Imber 1982; Ryan and Fraser 1988). In the monitoring study on northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacia-lis) in the North Sea intact stomachs from scavenged fulmars or black-legged kit-tiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) were occasionally found, which contained plastic (Van Franeker et al. 2011). A spectacular example of secondary ingestions was provided by Perry et al. (2013) who reported a ball of nylon fishing line in the stomach of a little auk (Alle alle), that was found in the stomach of a goose fish (Lophius americanus). The presence of small plastic particles in the faeces of fur seals on Macquarie Island was attributed to secondary ingestion through the consumption of myctophid fishes (Eriksson and Burton 2003). High abundance of small plastics in myctophid fishes (Boerger et al. 2010; Davison and Asch 2011), in combination with the fact that this type of fish is a common prey for many larger marine preda-tors, suggest that secondary ingestion may be more common than reported.
4.4.2  Impacts of Plastic Ingestion
Plastic ingestion may directly cause mortality or can affect animals by slower sub-lethal physical and chemical effects which are best considered separately.
4.4.2.1  Direct Mortality Caused by Plastic Ingestion
When the gastrointestinal tract becomes completely blocked or severely damaged 
ingested plastic may lead to rapid death. Even small pieces can cause the blockage 93
4 Deleterious Effects of Litter on Marine Life
of the intestines of animals, if orientated in the wrong way (Bjorndal et al. 1994). 
An ingested straw led to the death of a Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magel-
lanicus) by perforation of the stomach wall (Brandao et al. 2011). Other exam-ples of lethal impacts in seabirds were provided, for example, by Kenyon and Kridler (1969), Pettit et al. (1981) and Colabuono et al. (2009). Cases of mortality 
among marine turtles have been reported by e.g. Bjorndal et al. (1994), Bugoni et al. (2001), Mrosovsky et al. (2009) and Tourinho et al. (2010). Unlike most birds, turtles seem to pass plastic debris easily into the gut, and therefore most plastics have been found in the intestines rather than the stomach (e.g. Bjorndal et al. 1994; Bugoni et al. 2001; Tourinho et al. 2010, Campani et al. 2013). As a 
consequence, physical impact in turtles may often be related to gut functioning or damage. In the Mediterranean Sea, the death of a sperm whale of 4.5 t, was attrib-uted to 7.6 kg of plastic debris in its stomach, which was ruptured probably due to the large plastic load (de Stephanis et al. 2013). Often, it is difficult to produce 
evidence for causal links between ingested debris and mortality, and as a conse-quence, documented cases of death through plastic ingestion are rare (Sievert and Sileo 1993; Colabuono et al. 2009). A direct lethal result from ingestion probably 
does not occur at a frequency relevant at the population level. Indirect, sub-lethal effects are probably more relevant.
4.4.3  Indirect Physical Effects of Plastic Ingestion
Impacts that are deleterious for the individual but not directly lethal become rel-evant to populations if many individuals are affected. Partial blockage or moderate damage of the digestive tract in Laysan albatross chicks was not a major cause of direct mortality, but may contribute to poor nutrition or dehydration (Auman et al. 
1997). Since virtually every chick in this population (frequency of occurrence: 97.6 %) had a considerable quantity of plastic in the stomach, debris ingestion must be considered a relevant factor in overall fledging success of the population. Major proportions of tubenosed seabird species and marine turtles ingest plastic on a very regular basis. This raises urgent questions concerning the cumulative physical and chemical impacts at the population level. Sub-lethal physical impacts may have various consequences.
Firstly, stomach volume occupied by debris may limit optimal food intake. 
For example, tubenosed seabirds have large proventricular stomachs because they depend on irregular patchy food availability. Reduced storage capacity affects optimal foraging at times when this should be possible. Partial blockage of food passage through the digestive tract may cause gradual deterioration of body con-dition of fish (Hoss and Settle 1990). Efficiency of digestive processes may be reduced when sheet-like plastics or fragments cover parts of the intestinal wall. Sometimes ulcerations are found on stomach walls of organisms that ingested plastic (Pettit et al. 1981; Hoss and Settle 1990). A potentially important physi-cal impact from ingested plastics may be a feeling of satiation as receptors signal 94 S. Kühn et al.
satiety to the brain and reduce the feeling of hunger (Day et al. 1985), which may 
reduce the drive to search for food (Hoss and Settle 1990). High volumes of plas-tic can reduce proventricular contraction, responsible for the stimulation of appe-tite (Sturkie 1976).
All these factors may lead to a deterioration of the body condition of animals. 
In young loggerhead turtles, McCauley and Bjorndal (1999) found experimental evidence, that volume reduction in stomachs by non-food material caused lower nutrient and energy uptake. Similarly Lutz (1990) found a negative correlation between plastic consumption and nutritional condition in experiments with green turtles (Chelonia mydas) and loggerhead turtles. Ryan (1988) provided evidence for a negative effect on uptake of food and growth rate among chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) that had been fed plastic pellets under controlled laboratory conditions, compared to control chickens.
In many non-experimental studies, researchers have looked for correlations 
between plastic loads and body condition. Some seabird studies indicate negative correlations between ingested plastics and body condition (e.g. Connors and Smith 1982; Harper and Fowler 1987; Donnely-Greenan et al. 2014; Lavers et al. 2014). 
However, no such correlation was found by Day et al. (1985), Furness (1985), 
Sileo et al. (1990), Moser and Lee (1992), Van Franeker and Meijboom (2002) and Vliestra and Parga (2002). In these non-experimental studies, it is always prob-lematic to distinguish cause and consequence: do animals increase ingestion of abnormal items such as plastics when in poor condition, or do they loose condi-tion because of the plastic debris in their stomach? This is even more complicated because many studies are based on corpses of beached animals that often starved before being washed ashore with potentially aberrant foraging activity.
We conclude that the estimated impact from plastic ingestion on body condition 
is difficult to document in wild populations. However, as mentioned above, experi-mental studies clearly indicate that eating plastic reduces an individual’s body con-dition. This may not be directly lethal but will translate into negative effects on average survival and reproductive success in populations in which plastic ingestion is a common phenomenon.
4.4.3.1  Chemical Effects from Plastic Ingestion
The chemical substances added during manufacture or adsorbed to plastics at sea 
are an additional source of concern in terms of sublethal effects. Potential chem-ical impacts from the ingestion of plastic are not exhaustively discussed in this chapter, as chemical transfer and impacts are discussed in more detail in the con-tributions by Koelmans (2015) and Rochman (2015). We would like to stress, however, that in larger organisms, plastics often have a long residence time, during which objects may be fragmented to smaller sizes due to mechanical or enzymatic digestive processes. In such conditions, the chemical additives may play a more prominent role than chemicals adsorbed to the surface. We conclude that although research to quantify body burden and consequences of plastic-derived chemicals in 95
4 Deleterious Effects of Litter on Marine Life
marine organisms is still in its infancy, there is a risk to species frequently ingest-
ing synthetic debris. This will remain a complicated issue due to the widespread presence of many chemicals and their accumulation in marine foodwebs along routes other than plastics alone.
4.4.3.2  Chain of Impacts Related to Plastic Ingestion
By ingesting plastics, marine biota, and in particular seabirds, accidentally facili-
tate and catalyse the global distribution of plastic through bio-transportation. Studies of polar tubenosed seabirds returning to clean breeding areas after over -
wintering in more polluted regions are a good example. Similarly, Van Franeker and Bell (1988) found that cape petrels (Daption capense) process and excrete some 75 % of their initial plastic load by grinding particles in the gizzard dur -
ing one month in Antarctica. Plastics are thus excreted as smaller particles in other places than where they were taken up and become available to other trophic levels in marine and terrestrial habitats. Similar data were obtained for northern fulmars and thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia) in the Canadian high Arctic (Mallory 2008; Provencher et al. 2010, Van Franeker et al. 2011). In the Antarctic, Van Franeker and Bell (1988) also found that 75 % of Wilsons storm petrel (Oceanites oceanicus) chicks that died before fledging had plastics in their stomachs, fed to them by their parents and now permanently deposited around Antarctic breeding colonies. Transport of materials may be considerable. Van Franeker (2011) calculated that northern fulmars in the North Sea area (plastic incidence 95 %, average number 35 plastic items, average mass 0.31 g per bird) annually reshape and redistribute ca. 630 million pieces or 6 t of plastic. As ful-mars range over large areas, widespread secondary distribution of plastics will occur. Chemicals may be brought to other environments by seabirds (Blais et al. 2005)—potentially partly linked to plastics. From an average plastic mass of 10 g in healthy Laysan albatross chicks on Midway Atoll to about 20 g in chicks 
that died (Auman et al. 1997) it may be conservatively estimated, that this spe-cies with locally ca. 600,000 breeding pairs, annually brings ashore some 6 t of marine plastic debris. Also, some crustaceans reshape and redistribute plastics: Davidson (2012) showed that boring crustacean Sphaeroma sp. could release into the environment thousands of small particles per burrow. One of the open ques-tions is how plastic items reach the deep sea despite their low density and there-fore low sinking rates. Along with increased density by fouling processes (Ye and Andrady 1991) plastic may also be transported to the deep sea either through 
sinking of carcasses containing plastics, in marine snow (Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013) or repackaged in the faeces of zooplankton (Cole et al. 2013) or other pelagic organisms. Vertical export may also be facilitated by migratory behaviour of mesopelagic fish in the water column, which had fed on plastic items (Choy and Drazen 2013). Thus, marine life is as a significant factor in the environmental 
production and redistribution of secondary microplastics.96 S. Kühn et al.
4.4.4  Impacts from Species Dispersal
One of the potentially deleterious effects of marine debris is that it offers oppor -
tunities for the dispersal, or ‘hitch hiking’ of species around the world. Organisms 
can colonise non-degradable material and be transported by the currents and winds. Once settled in a new habitat, this can lead to massive population growth of ‘alien species’ that can outcompete original ecosystem components (Kiessling et al. 2015). Oceanic plastics can also provide new or increased habitat opportu-
nities for specialized species such as ocean skaters (Goldstein et al. 2012; Majer et al. 2012) or whole pelagic or benthic communities (Goldberg 1997; Bauer et al. 2008; Zettler et al. 2013; Goldstein et al. 2014). For more details on hitch-hiking 
species see Kiessling et al. (2015).
4.5  Discussion
The total number of marine species with documented records of either entangle-ment and/or ingestion has doubled with an increase from 267 species in Laist (1997) to 557 species in this new review (Table 4.3 and Online Supplements). The increase in number of affected species is substantial in all groups. The documented impact for marine turtles increased from 86 to 100 % of species (now 7 of 7 spe-
cies), for marine mammals from 43 to 66 % of species (now 81 of 123 species) and for seabirds from 44 to 50 % of species (now 203 of 406 species). Among marine mammals the percentage of affected whales increased from 37 to 68 % of species (now 54 of 80 species) and seals from 58 to 67 % of species (now 22 of 32 species) (see Table 4.3).
Laist (1997) addressed groups such as fish and invertebrates only marginally, so 
comparative figures in such groups (Tables 4.1, 4.2, 4.3) are currently of less use. 
We may have missed sources, and recently publications have been published at such high frequency that we cannot guarantee completeness as given in full in the online supplement, with derived data in Table 4.4.
We have stopped our additions to the online supplement and thus to derived 
tables on the 9th of December 2014. We welcome documentation on missed or new records of entanglement or ingestion for future updates. It remains important to continue such documentation of species affected by marine debris. However, given sufficient time and research effort, all species of marine organisms will get documented examples of interaction with marine debris. Any species can become the victim of entanglement. Furthermore, the filter-feeding habits of many lower trophic levels, and secondary ingestion by higher trophic levels, make it almost unavoidable that any species in the marine food web will at some stage pass at least some plastic debris through the intestinal tract.
As a consequence, to improve on current knowledge, future assessments of del-
eterious effects of debris on marine life require comparable standardized data on fre-quency of occurrence, ingestion quantification and categorisation of ingested debris. It is only through study of the various impacts (including frequency and quantity) on 97

different species and their interactions, combined with dedicated observational or 
experimental studies, that we can ultimately gain areal understanding of the many deleterious impacts of marine plastic debris on wild populations. A number of recom-mendations can be made to assist collection of comparable high-quality data sets:
•	Accurate data on frequency of occurrence of entanglement or ingestion of 
debris require a proper a priori protocol, staff that has experience with identify-ing (symptoms of) marine debris and adequate samples sizes.
•	Concerning frequency of entanglement in debris, protocols for assessment are complicated by the distinction between interaction with active fishing gear and 98 S.

4 Deleterious Effects of Litter on Marine Life
interaction with marine debris. For example, even for experts using standard 
protocols, it is difficult to distinguish whether wounds are caused by entangle-ment in active or derelict fishing gear, even when remains of nets or similar are found on the body. Some suggestions are being developed concerning entangle-ment rates in ghost nets or for bird entanglement in synthetic materials used for nest construction (MSFD-TSGML 2013).
•	For ingestion, in addition to frequency of occurrence (‘incidence’) it is recom-mended to collect data on quantities of ingested debris not only on the basis of numbers of items but also by mass of categories.
•	In such ingestion records, as a minimum it is recommended to separate industrial plastics (pellets) from consumer-waste plastics (see Table 4.5). The latter if possible 
can be further specified following the categorisation recommended for ingestion by birds, mammals and fishes according to the EU Marine Strategy Directive (MSFD-TSGML 2013), that is into categories of sheetlike, threadlike, foamed, hard frag-
mented, and other synthetic items, plus categories of non-plastic rubbish.
•	For averaged data, information should be provided as ‘population averages’ with standard error of the mean. Population averages are calculated with the inclusion of individuals without ingested plastics. Additional data can be maximum lev-els observed, or proportions of animals exceeding a particular limit [such as the 0.1-g critical limit in the Ecological Quality Objective for plastic ingestion by northern fulmars (Van Franeker et al. 2011)] (see Table 4.5). We emphasize this 
explicit use of population averages because in quite a few of the publications checked for this review averages had been calculated just over those individuals that had plastic, often not specifying that zero values had been omitted.
•	Negative species results (e.g. Avery-Gomm et al. 2013; Provencher et al. 2014) are also relevant but again should be based on an adequate sample size of animals stud-ied according to a proper protocol. Thus, records of absence of debris for an indi-vidual sample should be as firm as those on presence. From experience in our own research group, we know of claims on absence or near absence of plastics in stom-achs or guts of several species of which diets were studied, but without dedicated methods or data recording for marine debris (including zeros). Once proper meth-ods were established for laboratory procedures and data recording, each of those species was found to contain debris regularly (e.g. Bravo-Rebolledo et al. 2013).
•	Examples of protocols for ingested debris in intestinal tracts of larger organisms can be found in e.g. MSFD-TSGML (2013), with further information for ingestion by marine birds in Van Franeker et al. (2011) and marine turtles in Camedda et al. (2014). Standard protocols for marine mammals, invertebrates have not yet been 
established in detail but may largely follow those for seabirds and turtles. In gen-eral, these studies consider debris of ≥ 1 mm by using sieves with such mesh size.
•	Only when using the above approaches on frequency of occurrence (proportion of animals in populations affected) and gravity of interaction (quantity of ingested material; damage level from entanglement), it becomes possible to design experi-mental or other dedicated studies that allow estimates of the true impact of plastic ingestion on wildlife populations. This relates to both the physical and chemi-cal types of impacts, and will ultimately require model predictions using demo-graphic characteristics of the species involved (Criddle et al. 2009).104 S. Kühn et al.Table 4.5  Recommended mode of data presentation for ingested plastic debris, using the example of plastics ingested by northern fulmars in different sub-
regions of the North Sea (modified from Van Franeker and the ‘Save the North Sea Fulmar’ study group, 2013)
Given are sample size, percentage of individuals with ingested material (incidence or frequency of occurrence), and population averages (including zero 
values) with standard error (se) for both number of items (n) and mass. These are specified for industrial plastics and consumer waste separately, and in total. Added to total plastics in this example are geometric mean mass and EcoQO performance that is the percentage of fulmars that had more than the critical level of 0.1 g of total plastic in the stomachRegions Industrial granules User plastics Total plastics

4 Deleterious Effects of Litter on Marine Life
It will take considerable time and effort to collect these data and conduct dedicated 
studies before firm conclusions can be drawn on the level of detrimental impact of marine plastic debris on wildlife. However, in our opinion the suffering and death of individuals, in combination with the likelihood of higher-level population effects, indicates the need for a rapid reduction of input of plastic debris into the marine environment. If wildlife problems are not convincing: recent studies show that chemical and physical impacts are likely to occur in marine food webs (e.g. Van Cauwenberghe and Janssen 2014; Rochman et al. 2013, 2014), which implies 
potential impacts on human end consumers (Galloway 2015).
Long-term studies on seabirds have shown that measures to reduce loss of plas-
tics to the environment do have relatively rapid effects. After considerable atten-tion to the massive loss of industrial pellets to the marine environment in the early 1980s, improvements in production and transport methods were reflected in a visi-ble result in the marine environment within one to two decades: several studies from around the globe showed that by the early 2000s the number of industrial granules in seabird stomachs had approximately halved from levels observed in the 1980s (Van Franeker and Meijboom 2002; Vlietstra and Parga 2002; Ryan 2008; Van 
Franeker et al. 2011; Van Franeker and Law 2015). These examples indicate that it is possible to reduce deleterious impacts from marine plastic debris on marine wild-life in shorter time frames than the longevity of the material might suggest.

M. Bergmann et al. (eds.), Marine Anthropogenic Litter,  DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-16510-3_5Abstract For decades we have learned about the physical hazards associated with 
plastic debris in the marine environment, but recently we are beginning to realize 
the chemical hazards. Assessing hazards associated with plastic in aquatic habitats is not simple, and requires knowledge regarding organisms that may be exposed, the exposure concentrations, the types of polymers comprising the debris, the length of time the debris was present in the aquatic environment (affecting the size, shape and fouling) and the locations and transport of the debris during that time period. Marine plastic debris is associated with a ‘cocktail of chemicals’, including chemicals added or produced during manufacturing and those present in the marine environment that accumulate onto the debris from surrounding seawa-ter. This raises concerns regarding: (i) the complex mixture of chemical substances associated with marine plastic debris, (ii) the environmental fate of these chemi-cals to and from plastics in our oceans and (iii) how this mixture affects wildlife, as hundreds of species ingest this material in nature. The focus of this chapter is on the mixture of chemicals associated with marine plastic debris. Specifically, this chapter discusses the diversity of chemical ingredients, byproducts of manu-facturing and sorbed chemical contaminants from the marine environment among plastic types, the role of marine plastic debris as a novel medium for environmen-tal partitioning of chemical contaminants in the ocean and the toxic effects that may result from plastic debris in marine animals.

5.1  Introduction
Since the Industrial Revolution, there has been an exponential increase in the pro-
duction and use of chemical substances, such that now the amount of chemicals produced annually is more than 400× greater than the amount produced annually four decades ago (Binetti et al. 2008). Among these chemical substances are sev-eral of the ingredients used in the manufacturing of plastics (Lithner et al. 2011). This increasing production and use is inevitably accompanied by an increase in waste, creating a challenge for waste management. Several mechanisms have recently been developed for managing waste, including landfill, wastewater treat-ment and recycling. Still, these mechanisms are not 100 % efficient and/or do not yet exist in several locations worldwide. The marine environment, residing at the end of most watersheds, is thus often the ultimate sink for many of these sub-stances, including plastic, when not properly managed. As a consequence, plastic debris and many chemical contaminants are detected in our oceans globally.
In parallel with chemicals, the production rate of plastics has increased exponen-
tially, from 0.5 million tons produced annually in 1950 to greater than 299 million tons produced annually today (Thompson et al. 2009; PlasticsEurope 2013). Of this material, 
less than 50 % was accounted for in the waste stream in 2012 (Rochman et al. 2013a). While some of these products may be still in use, others become litter. Today, marine plastic pollution has become ubiquitous and is reported globally from the ocean sur -
face (Thompson et al. 2004; Goldstein et al. 2013; Eriksen et al. 2014; Law et al. 2014; Desforges et al. 2014) to the deep sea (Goldberg 1997; Galgani et al. 2000).
For decades we have learned about the physical hazards associated with this pollu-
tion in the marine environment (Laist 1987), but recently we are beginning to realize the chemical hazards. Marine plastic debris is associated with a ‘cocktail of chemicals’, including chemicals added or produced during manufacturing (Lithner et al. 2011) and those present in the marine environment that accumulate onto the debris from surround-ing seawater (Mato et al. 2001; Ogata et al. 2009). This begs several questions regard-
ing: (i) the complex mixture of chemical substances associated with marine plastic debris, (ii) the environmental fate of these chemicals to and from plastics in our oceans and (iii) how this mixture affects wildlife, as hundreds of species ingest this material in nature (CBD 2012). The focus of this chapter is on the mixture of chemicals associated with marine plastic debris. Specifically, this chapter discusses the diversity of chemical ingredients, byproducts of manufacturing and sorbed chemical contaminants from the marine environment, the role of marine plastic debris as a novel medium for environ-mental partitioning of chemical contaminants in the ocean and the toxic effects that may result from plastic debris in marine animals.
5.1.1  Plastic Marine Debris: A Complex Mixture  
of Chemicals
Marine plastic debris is associated with a complex mixture of chemicals, includ-
ing those that are ingredients of the plastic material (e.g. monomers and additives), 119
5 The Complex Mixture, Fate and Toxicity of Chemicals …
byproducts of manufacturing (e.g. chemicals composed during the combustion of 
the raw material petroleum) and chemical contaminants in the ocean that accumu-late on plastic when it becomes marine debris (e.g. persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and metals). There is evidence that this mixture, or ‘cocktail of contami-nants’ (Fig. 5.1; Rochman 2013), can be bioavailable to whales (Fossi et al. 2012, 2014), basking sharks (Fossi et al. 2014), seabirds (Teuten et al. 2009; Tanaka et al. 2013; Lavers et al. 2014), amphipods (Chua et al. 2014), crickets (Gaylor et al. 2012), lugworms (Arenicola marina) (Besseling et al. 2013; Browne et al. 2013) and fish (Rochman et al. 2013b) upon ingestion. This is a cause for con-
cern, as the (USEPA 2013) and the European Union (European Commission 2014) list several of these chemicals as priority pollutants because they are persistent, bioacummulative and/or toxic. In fact, of the chemicals listed as priority pollut-ants by the US EPA, 78 % are associated with marine plastic debris (Rochman et al. 2013a). This section discusses the complex mixture of chemicals associated with marine plastic debris, including those that originate from manufacturing, that accumulate from surrounding ocean water and how this mixture may vary accord-ing to the location where plastic is discarded and the plastic type.
5.1.2  Plastics and Their Chemical Ingredients
There are several different types of plastics manufactured into a diversity of prod-ucts. Each is produced by polymerizing individual monomers, forming the back-bone of the polymer. These are made using solvents and other chemicals that may be used as initiators and catalysts. Next, several additives (e.g. flame retardants,

stabilizers, pigments and fillers) are included to give the plastic certain character -
istics (e.g. flexibility, strength and color; OECD 2004; Lithner et al. 2011). Such 
chemicals, in addition to byproducts, may be released during production, use and disposal of the product, several of which can be harmful (Oehlmann et al. 2009; Teuten et al. 2009; Halden et al. 2010; Lithner et al. 2011; Papaleo et al. 2011). According to United Nations and European Union frameworks, >50 % of the plas-tics that are produced are hazardous based upon their constituent monomers, addi-tives and byproducts (Lithner et al. 2011).
The backbone structure, derived from long chains of monomers, are thought 
to be biochemically inert due to their large molecular size (Teuten et al. 2009; Lithner et al. 2011). Still, several of these are shown to have harmful effects (Xu et al. 2004; Halden et al. 2010; Lithner et al. 2011). Bisphenol A, used in the production of polycarbonate, can have endocrine disrupting effects (Oehlmann et al. 2009; Crain et al. 2007; Halden et al. 2010) and the styrene and polyvi-nyl chloride monomer, used in the production of polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), can be carcinogenic and/or mutagenic (Papaleo et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2004; Lithner et al. 2011) and are listed as toxic substances by the USEPA, ATSDR and OSPAR.
Several of the chemicals used in the production process, including solvents, 
suspension aids, surfactants, initiators, catalysts and byproducts can also be harm-ful upon exposure (Lithner et al. 2011). For example, tributyltin (shown to cause endocrine disruption in molluscs; Oehlmann et al. 1996) and copper chloride (shown to have developmental effects on fish; Anderson et al. 1991) are added as 
catalysts during production (Lithner et al. 2011) and several solvents (shown to be carcinogenic; Lynge et al. 1997) are used in the production process (e.g. methanol, cyclohexane and 1,2-dichlorobenzene; Braun et al. 2005; Gowariker et al. 2003; 
Lithner et al. 2011).
The additive ingredients include plasticizers, antioxidants, flame-retardants 
and UV-stabilizers. In some cases, the ingredients make up a large proportion of the plastic product. Phthalates may constitute up to 50 % of the total weight of PVC plastics (Bauer and Herrmann 1997). The use of additives is also not equally distributed across plastic types—PVC requires the most additives accounting for 73 % of the world production of additives by volume, followed by polyethylene and polypropylene (10 % by volume) and styrenics (5 % by vol-ume) (Lithner et al. 2011). Several of these have been recognized or suggested to be hazardous, including the brominated flame retardants (PBDEs), phthalate plasticizers and lead heat stabilizers (Oehlmann et al. 2009; Halden et al. 2010; Lithner et al. 2011).
Finally, some hazardous chemicals may be produced as byproducts during 
manufacturing. PAH formation occurs during the production cycle of polysty-rene (Zabaniotou and Kassidi 2003; Kwon and Castaldi 2008). Residuals of these chemicals may be difficult to remove, therefore carry over into the plastic product and become one of the many chemicals in the cocktail of contaminants associated with marine plastic debris. Thus, when considering the hazards associated with plastic debris, it is important to consider polymer type.121
5 The Complex Mixture, Fate and Toxicity of Chemicals …
5.1.3  The Accumulation of Chemicals on Plastic Debris  
in the Marine Environment
Because of their physical and chemical properties, plastics accumulate a complex 
mixture of chemical contaminants present in the surrounding seawater (Mato et al. 2001; Teuten et al. 2007, 2009; Rochman et al. 2013c; Holmes et al. 2012; Engler 
2012), adding to the cocktail of chemicals already present from manufacturing. As a result of widespread global contamination of chemical contaminants (Ogata et al. 2009; Ross and Birnbaum 2010) and plastic debris (Thompson et al. 2004; Barnes et al. 2009; Browne et al. 2011), marine plastic debris is recovered glob-ally with measurable amounts of POPs (e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), PAHs and PBDEs) and other persistent bioaccumulative and toxic substances (PBTs) (e.g. halogenated flame retardants, pesticides and nonylphenol; Mato et al. 2001; Endo et al. 2005; Ogata et al. 2009; Hirai et al. 2011; Heskett et al. 2012; Rios et al. 2010) and metals (e.g. lead, copper and cadmium; Ashton et al. 2010; 
Holmes et al. 2012; Rochman et al. 2014a).
PBTs, which include those listed as POPs by the Stockholm Convention, gener -
ally have a low water-solubility (i.e. are hydrophobic) and tend to partition out of the water column and onto another environmental matrix with similar hydropho-bic properties (e.g. sediment, organic matter); thus, when PBTs encounter plastic debris they tend to sorb to this material (Engler 2012). Thus, it is not surprising 
that an early study reported PCBs on marine plastic debris (Carpenter and Smith 1972) or that plastics are used as passive samplers to quantify PBTs in aquatic environments (Huckins et al. 1993; Lohmann 2012).
Today, the accumulation of PBTs on plastic debris is unequivocal. Global sam-
ples show the presence of PBTs on plastic debris collected from coastal beaches (Van et al. 2011; Heskett et al. 2012; Fries et al. 2012; Fisner et al. 2013; Antunes 
et al. 2013) all the way to the remote open-ocean (Rios et al. 2007, 2010; Hirai 
et al. 2011). As such, plastic pre-production pellets, a recognizable component of 
marine debris, are now used to examine the global pattern of PBTs (Ogata et al. 2009; Takada et al. 2006), acting as passive samplers and providing baseline infor -
mation regarding PBT contamination in the ocean. International Pellet Watch leads this effort, collecting plastic pellets globally and measuring the concentra-tions of various PBTs sorbed to plastic debris (Takada et al. 2006; Ogata et al. 2009; see also Fig. 5.3 in Hidalgo-Ruz and Thiel 2015 in this volume).
The presence of organic chemicals on plastic debris may be established glob-
ally, but the presence of a complex mixture of metals on plastic debris has only been recently demonstrated (Ashton et al. 2010; Holmes et al. 2012; Nakashima et al. 2011, 2012; Rochman et al. 2014a). Similar to organic chemicals, several 
metals have long been additive ingredients of plastics (e.g. lead added to PVC; Lithner et al. 2011; Nakashima et al. 2011, 2012), but now we have evidence that 
plastic debris accumulates metals from ocean water (Ashton et al. 2010; Holmes et al. 2012; Rochman et al. 2014a). Environmental accumulation of metals onto plastics may have been expected, as the surfaces of plastic containers are known 122 C.M. Rochman
to accumulate metals from water samples (Fischer et al. 2007; Weijuan et al. 2001; 
Robertson 1968). The accumulation of metals on marine plastic debris may be 
explained by both the chemical ingredients of the plastic (e.g. catalysts, fillers, plasticizers; Robertson 1968) and the degradation and fouling of aquatic plastic debris via microbial biofilms and colonization by algae and invertebrates (Holmes et al. 2012; Tien and Chen 2013) that may generate active sites for the sorption and/or bioaccumulation of metals. As such, similar to organic chemicals, plastic pellets may also serve as a passive sampler for metal contamination in the marine environment.
5.1.3.1  Spatial Variability
It should be noted that, similar to passive samplers, the types and concentrations 
of sorbed chemicals associated with marine plastic debris reflect the types and concentrations of chemical contaminants in ambient seawater. As such, the type and concentrations of chemicals sorbed to plastic debris will vary based upon the location that the debris is recovered on large (Ogata et al. 2009; Hirai et al. 2011; Fig. 5.2) and small spatial scales (Rochman et al. 2013c). Data from International 
Pellet Watch show that PCBs on plastic pellets collected from beaches spanning over 1000 km of the California coastline vary by one order of magnitude (23–605 ng/g; www. pelletwatch.org). Similarly, pellets recovered from eight beaches throughout a single Californian county, San Diego (3.8–42 ng/g total PCBs; Van et al. 2011), and pellets deployed at different locations within a single bay, San 
Diego Bay (3.4–35 ng/g; Rochman et al. 2013c), had concentrations of PCBs that also varied by one order of magnitude. Moreover, variations in concentrations of metal contaminants recovered from four beaches along a stretch of coastline in Devon, England (Ashton et al. 2010) and deployed at several locations within the San Diego Bay, CA (Rochman et al. 2014a) varied similarly to organic contam-inants, also by one order of magnitude. Thus, variability in contaminant burden

tic debris may mediate the fate of some contaminants (e.g. PAHs) among different environmental 
compartments, including the sea-surface microlayer, water, sediment, sediment pore water and biota, in the marine environment123
5 The Complex Mixture, Fate and Toxicity of Chemicals …
reflects local sources and global chemical contamination. Such spatial variation 
has implications for the management, as discarded plastics may pose a greater hazard and thus a greater management priority in locations with greater point sources and greater concentrations of chemical pollutants.
5.1.3.2  Variability by Plastic Type and Size
Also of implication for management is how the accumulation of chemical contam-
inants may vary among type and size of plastic debris. If some plastic types tend to carry a smaller burden of contaminants due to their physical and chemical prop-erties, items that often become marine debris (e.g. fishing and aquaculture gear; Andrady 2011) could be produced out of potentially safer plastic types.
There are several reasons why we might expect the behavior of contaminants 
to vary according to plastic type. The physical and chemical properties of each type of plastic [e.g. surface area (Teuten et al. 2007), diffusivity (Karapanagiot and Klontza 2008; Pascall et al. 2005; Rusina et al. 2007; Mato et al. 2001) and crys-
tallinity (Karapanagioti and Klontza 2008; Mato et al. 2001)] influence the accu-mulation of chemicals to plastic debris (Pascall et al. 2005; Rusina et al. 2007) and accumulation patterns will be compound-specific (e.g. increasing in affinity to the polymer with greater hydrophobicity; Smedes et al. 2009). For organic chemi-cals, several studies show that polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene sorb greater concentrations of organic contaminants than PVC and polyethylene tere-phthalate (PET; Pascall et al. 2005; Teuten et al. 2007; Karapagioti and Klontza 2008; Rochman et al. 2013c, d). For some chemicals (i.e. PAHs), polyethylene 
and polystyrene sorb greater concentrations than polypropylene (Lee et al. 2014; Rochman et al. 2013c), whereas for others (i.e. PCBs) there is no detectable differ -
ence (Rochman et al. 2013c). Rubbery polymers, such as polyethylene and poly-propylene are expected to demonstrate greater diffusion than the glassy polymers, PET and PVC, which may explain their greater sorptive capacity (Pascall et al. 
2005). Polyethylene has a greater sorptive capacity than polypropylene (Teuten et al. 2007), probably due to its greater surface area (Teuten et al. 2007) and free volume (Pascall et al. 2005). Moreover, diffusion into the polymer has been observed in polyethylene pellets, but not in polypropylene (Karapanagioti and Klontza 2008). This is likely the reason that polyethylene has a large affinity for a 
wide range of organic contaminants varying in hydrophobicity (Müller et al. 2001) and is often used as a passive-sampling device (Lohmann 2012; Pascall et al. 2005). For polystyrene, the presence of benzene increases the distance between adjacent polymeric chains, which can make it easier for a chemical to diffuse into the polymer (Pascall et al. 2005), and may explain why contaminants sorb sim-ilarly to polystyrene as they do to polyethylene, despite being a glassy polymer (Pascall et al. 2005).
These trends may not extend to all classes of contaminants. Compound-specific 
interactions in the polymer phase are also important (Smedes et al. 2009). For example, PVC has a greater affinity for alkylbenzenes than does polyethylene 124 C.M. Rochman
(Wu et al. 2001). Moreover, for metal contaminants, there does not appear to be 
a large difference in sorption concentration among polymer types (Rochman et al. 
2014a). A possible explanation is that the accumulation of metals to plastic may be immaterial, and the process may be mediated by a biofilm (Rochman et al. 2014a). In the aquatic environment, including marine systems, it is well established that biofilms have sorptive properties and accumulate metals and other contaminants (Decho 2000; Tien et al. 2009) and it has been suggested that the composition of 
biofilm does not vary significantly among plastic types (Ye and Andrady 1991; Zettler et al. 2013).
The sorption behavior of chemicals to plastic will also vary by size. Because 
of the difference in surface area, plastic of differing sizes will sorb contaminants accordingly (Koelmans et al. 2013; Velzeboer et al. 2014). Size will affect both the sorptive capacity and the rate at which chemicals are sorbed (Teuten et al. 2009). For example, nano- and micrometre-sized plastic debris may exchange organic chemicals faster than millimetre-sized plastic debris due to its larger sur -
face area and short diffusion path lengths (Koelmans et al. 2013). Plastic may enter the ocean as nano- and micro-sized debris (e.g. as microscrubbers or laundry lint; Browne et al. 2011) or it may become smaller over time via photodegrada-
tion. Photodegradation of the polymer surface accelerates and increases the sorp-tion capacity by altering surface properties and increasing surface area (Mato et al. 2001; Holmes et al. 2012; Rochman et al. 2013). The combination of increased sorption rate and capacity in smaller plastic debris may constitute increased risk in marine organisms (Velzeboer et al. 2014).
Thus, when assessing the hazard associated with plastic debris it is important to 
think holistically. Patterns are not simple or straightforward. While several lines of evidence show that polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene accumulate rel-atively large concentrations of some contaminants (e.g. POPs), polyethylene and polypropylene are made from the least hazardous monomers (Lithner et al. 2011) while polystyrene is made from the styrene monomer, which is a priority pollut-ant. Thus, the complex mixture of chemicals associated with plastic debris will be dependent on the type and size of the plastic and the location where it becomes marine debris.
5.1.4  Plastic Debris, Environmental Chemical Contaminants 
and Environmental Fate
The long-range transport, persistence and global dynamics of plastic debris are 
key aspects to understanding the ultimate fate of this material and any poten-tial impacts of plastic debris on marine ecosystems. Because it is now globally accepted that plastic debris accumulates chemical contaminants (Ogata et al. 2009; Teuten et al. 2009), it is also important to understand how plastic debris mediates these same key aspects for environmental chemical contaminants. This then begs questions regarding: (1) how plastic debris fits into environmental fate models for 125
5 The Complex Mixture, Fate and Toxicity of Chemicals …
chemical contaminant distribution and (2) how important plastic debris is relative 
to other media (e.g. water, sediment, biota) in driving processes of chemical distri-bution in the global oceans.
Chemical contaminants partition onto various environmental media, a process 
dependent upon the physical and chemical properties of each chemical and the phys-ical and chemical properties of the environmental medium (e.g. sediment, water, organic matter, living biota). These processes, along with the chemical, physical and biological degradation of each chemical contaminant (Sinkonnen et al. 2000), help to determine their environmental fate globally. The addition of plastic to the marine environment adds a novel medium for chemical contaminants to interact with, and thus it is important to understand how plastic debris should be considered in future environmental fate models (Fig. 5.3). This section will discuss plastics as a novel environmental matrix and its potential role in helping to mediate the fate and distribution of chemical contaminants globally. Specifically, this section will dis-cuss plastic debris as a sink and a source for chemical contaminants in the marine environment and how plastic may facilitate the global transport of chemicals in the marine environment and the transport of chemicals into marine foodwebs.

5.1.5  Plastic Debris as a Sink for Environmental 
Contaminants
There is no doubt that plastic debris acts as a sink for chemical contaminants in 
the marine environment. What is less understood is the process by which this occurs, how this varies over space and time and by polymer and chemical, and how important plastic is as a sink for chemicals relative to other environmental media (e.g. sediment, water and biota). The primary focus of this section will be on processes of chemical accumulation, temporal trends and comparisons among other environmental media.
5.1.5.1  Process of Accumulation
As noted above, the concentration of chemicals that sorb to plastic debris varies 
according to polymer type and chemical substance. One reason for these differ -
ences is the mechanism by which chemicals accumulate on the plastic. For some plastics (i.e. polyethylene and polyoxymethylene), organic chemicals absorb into the polymeric matrix (providing greater surface area for chemicals to accumu-late), whereas for other plastics the chemicals adsorb to the surface (Karapanagioti and Klontza 2008). As discussed above, these differences are related to the struc-ture of each polymer type. Despite this, observations are not consistent among contaminant groups. As such, the polymer structure may be less important and instead accumulation may be primarily facilitated by other factors. In this case, it is important to note that changes that occur to the plastic when it becomes marine debris (e.g. fouling and degradation) can alter the structure of the plastic debris (e.g. increasing their surface area and/or charge; Artham et al. 2009; Holmes et al. 
2012, 2014), changing the way of how chemicals accumulate on the material.
5.1.5.2  Rate of Accumulation
Alterations of the plastic material when it becomes marine debris also impact the 
rate at which chemicals accumulate, also varying by polymer type and chemical of interest. For example, chemicals with less hydrophobicity and a lighter molecular weight reach saturation faster than those with greater hydrophobicity and a heav-ier molecular weight (Müller et al. 2001; Rochman et al. 2013c). Moreover, the mechanism by which chemicals accumulate will affect the rate of accumulation. For example, we observe faster saturation of POPs on PET and PVC whose glassy structure allow for adsorption only, than for polyethylene, where diffusion into the polymeric matrix facilitates a rapid adsorption to the surface followed by a slower increase via absorption (Rochman et al. 2013c).
Of concern for management is the slower rate of accumulation that occurs in 
the marine environment when compared to a laboratory setting. In a laboratory, 127
5 The Complex Mixture, Fate and Toxicity of Chemicals …
chemicals (e.g. PAHs and metals) reach equilibrium on plastic in less than 72 h 
(Teuten et al. 2007; Holmes et al. 2012), whereas in the marine environment equilibrium occurs much slower (Mato et al. 2001; Rochman et al. 2013c). For example, on plastic pellets of various types (PET, PVC, polyethylene and poly-propylene) that were deployed in a contaminated bay for up to 1 year, neither PCBs, PAHs or metals reached equilibrium for at least 3 months and in several cases did not reach equilibrium within the 1-year time period (Rochman et al. 2013c, 2014a). In the marine environment, the surface properties of the plas-
tic debris consistently change. As plastic debris weathers it gains surface area, generates oxygen groups (increasing polarity; Mato et al. 2001; Fotopoulou and Karapanagioti 2012) and fouls (increasing their charge, roughness and porosity) 
(Artham et al. 2009)—all allowing plastic debris to accumulate increasingly larger concentrations of chemical contaminants (Holmes et al. 2012; Fotopoulou and Karapanagioti 2012; Rochman et al. 2013c, 2014a). Thus, in general, the longer 
the plastic is in the water, the greater concentrations of chemical contaminants it will accumulate (Engler et al. 2012), suggesting that plastic debris may become more hazardous the longer it remains at sea.
5.1.5.3  Comparisons with Other Environmental Media
Of greatest concern for management appears to be how the concentrations of 
hazardous chemicals accumulating on plastic debris compared to other environ-mental media. For several chemical groups it has been shown that pollutants can partition to plastic at greater than or equal concentrations than other environmental media. For example, POPs can accumulate on plastic debris at concentrations up to six orders of magnitude greater than ambient water (Ogata et al. 2009). Floating plastics are associated with the sea-surface microlayer, at the interface between the ocean and atmosphere, where large concentrations of chemical contaminants (e.g. PBTs and metals) accumulate due to its unique chemical composition (i.e. of lipids, fatty acids and proteins). Here, concentrations of organic contaminants are found at concentrations up to 500 × greater than underlying waters (Wurl 
and Obbard 2004). As such, floating plastic debris could easily accumulate rela-tively large concentrations of chemical contaminants from this sea-surface micro-layer (Mato et al. 2001), and may be one reason why we find large concentrations of chemicals on floating plastic debris recovered globally, including in remote regions (Heskett et al. 2012; Hirai et al. 2011). When comparing plastic debris to other solid matrices, concentrations of POPs on plastics have been found to accu-mulate at concentrations up to two orders of magnitude greater than on sediment and suspended particulates (Mato et al. 2001; Teuten et al. 2007) and concentra-
tions of metals on plastics have been found at similar concentrations (Holmes et al. 2012) to those on nearby sediment. Still, a thermodynamically-based model, assuming equilibrium, predicts that with the current concentrations of plastic debris in the oceans the total fraction of POPs sorbed to plastic debris is negligible in relation to all other media globally (i.e. <1 %; Gouin et al. 2011).128 C.M. Rochman
The accumulation of chemicals on plastic debris has several potential impli-
cations for management. It could be positive if plastic debris aids in the removal 
of some chemicals from the environment. For example, they may act as a perma-nent sink when plastic debris transports vertically to the bottom of the ocean in the same way that sinking natural particles (e.g. phytoplankton cells and fecal pel-lets) are considered a final sink when they sequester POPs (Dachs et al. 2002). However, it may also be considered negative if it aids in the transport of hazardous chemicals to remote regions of the world and/or to marine food webs. As such, it is important to understand how plastic debris acts as a sink, and also as a source.
5.1.6  Plastic Debris as a Source of Environmental 
Contaminants
Plastic, like other PBTs (e.g. POPs; Sinkonnen et al. 2000; Dachs et al. 2002), 
are persistent and bioaccumulative, and thus can be transported long distances via ocean currents (Law et al. 2010; Maximenko et al. 2012) or by the migration 
of ocean life. As such, plastics debris may play a role in the transport of sorbed chemical contaminants and chemical ingredients globally (Engler et al. 2012; Cheng et al. 2013; Endo et al. 2013; Kwon et al. 2014).
5.1.7  Global Transport
While sorbed onto floating plastic debris, chemical contaminants may be transported long distances, including across or even to adjacent oceans (Zarfl and Matthies 2010; Engler et al. 2012). Negatively buoyant plastics, or plastic debris that becomes 
negatively buoyant upon fouling, will sink to the seafloor transporting any sorbed contaminants to the benthos where sediment-dwelling organisms reside. If these chemicals are released upon degradation of the material, plastic debris may be a source of chemical contaminants into pelagic and benthic marine habitats (Teuten et al. 2007; Hirai et al. 2011). While some contaminants may be lost due to biologi-cal or physical degradation (Sinkonnen et al. 2000; Rochman et al. 2013c), leaching 
of chemicals back to the environment may be of concern in remote and more pristine regions where sources of chemical contaminants are sparse (Teuten et al. 2007; Hirai et al. 2011; Heskett et al. 2012). Laboratory studies have found that plastics with sorbed POPs release a considerable amount of these chemicals upon being placed in clean water (Teuten et al. 2007; Endo et al. 2013).
The behavior of chemicals from plastic debris will likely be dependent upon 
location-specific considerations that include temperature, salinity, the inten-sity of solar radiation, biodegradation rates, and the presence of co-contami-nants (Sinkonnen et al. 2000; Dachs et al. 2002; Bakir et al. 2012, 2014; Holmes 
et al. 2014). This process will also vary according to the hydrophobicity of the 129
5 The Complex Mixture, Fate and Toxicity of Chemicals …
chemicals, such that chemicals with a greater hydrophobicity desorb much slower 
and may take years or even centuries to fully attain equilibrium (Endo et al. 2013). This has implications for management, as certain chemicals may transfer long dis-tances holding onto the plastic as it migrates from a contaminated region to one that is remote and/or more pristine. Plastic debris sampled from remote regions with sporadic large concentrations of chemical support this theory (Hirai et al. 2011; Heskett et al. 2012).
A further consideration is how the transport of chemicals hitchhiking on plas-
tic debris compares to other transport mechanisms, such as atmospheric or ocean currents. A group of researchers used thermodynamically-based model calcula-tions (assuming sorptive equilibrium) to determine the relative importance of plastic debris as a source of PBTs to the remote Arctic Ocean (Zarfl and Matthies 2010). Their models conclude that transport via atmospheric and ocean currents are orders of magnitude larger than via plastic particles, determining that the con-tribution of PBTs from plastic debris may be negligible compared with annual PBT flux from other global-transport mechanisms (Zarfl and Matthies 2010). The authors warn that their model estimations include considerable uncertainty and suggest that future studies test the importance of plastic-mediated transport for chemicals with greater hydrophobicity and that are not generally transported via air or ocean currents (Zarfl and Matthies 2010). Moreover, there is a need to better 
understand the influence from different types of polymers and chemical contami-nants (Gouin et al. 2011). The physical and chemical properties (e.g. boiling point, vapor pressure, water solubility and octanol-water partitioning) of the monomers and additive ingredients in addition to properties of the polymer (e.g. the size of the plastic and its pore size) are important when assessing the environmental fate of associated chemicals (Teuten et al. 2009; Lithner et al. 2011). For example, glassy polymers, like PVC, have a slower desorption rate than rubbery polymers, such as polyethylene (Teuten et al. 2009). Moreover, one should consider how des-orption may differ in the presence of the microbial biofouling that populates plas-tic debris in the marine environment (Zettler et al. 2013) and may provide greater surface area for sorption, biodegrade and/or transform the chemical contaminants, or facilitate chemical leaching or transport into other environmental media, includ-ing the biota (Gouin et al. 2011).
5.1.7.1  Food Web Transport
Several researchers have tried to understand the role of plastic debris as a source 
of chemical contaminants into the foodweb, raising several questions regarding: (i) whether contaminants transfer from the plastic to animals upon ingestion,  
(ii) how important this may be relative to other sources of contaminants in food-webs and (iii) if contaminants from plastic debris biomagnify in top predators. These questions have been explored using computer modeling (Teuten et al. 2007; Gouin et al. 2011; Koelmans et al. 2013, 2014; Koelmans 2015), assessing cor -
relations between plastic ingestion and chemical body burdens (Ryan et al. 1988;  130 C.M. Rochman
Teuten et al. 2009; Yamashita et al. 2011; Tanaka et al. 2013; Lavers et al. 2014) 
and/or using experimental techniques to measure the bioaccumulation of chemi-
cals from plastic in laboratory animals (Gaylor et al. 2012; Besseling et al. 2013; Browne et al. 2013; Rochman et al. 2013b; Chua et al. 2014). Modeling approaches are useful for interpreting experimental and observation data, as well as for risk assessment of the hazards caused by plastic ingestion in wildlife (Koelmans 2015). Because this is discussed in detail by Koelmans (2015), the 
discussion here will be limited to observational data in the field and experimental data in the laboratory.
There are several lines of evidence suggesting that chemical contaminants do 
transfer from plastic debris to marine animals. Correlative evidence in the field and laboratory shows that the concentrations of PCBs (Ryan et al. 1988; Teuten et al. 2009; Yamashita et al. 2011) and trace metals (Lavers et al. 2014) in seabirds are positively correlated with the mass of ingested plastic. Moreover, seabirds col-lected from the North Pacific were found with similar congener patterns of PBDEs in their tissues as those found on the ingested plastic in their gut content (Tanaka et al. 2013) and myctophid fish collected from the South Atlantic were found with similar congener patterns of PBDEs in their tissues as those found on the plastic debris in the region (Rochman et al. 2014b). These observational data suggest that plastic-associated chemicals from plastic do transfer to wildlife upon ingestion.
This hypothesis has been further investigated in controlled laboratory studies, 
providing a stronger weight of evidence. Two studies demonstrated the bioaccu-mulation of additive PBDEs in crickets (Acheta domesticus; Gaylor et al. 2012) and amphipods (Allorchestes compressa; Chua et al. 2014) as a result of the inges-tion of plastic. Another study showed greater concentrations of PCBs in lugworms exposed to contaminated sediment with polystyrene as opposed to contami-nated sediment without plastic, suggesting that the existence of the plastic in the experiment facilitated the transfer of chemicals to lugworms (Arenicola marina; Besseling et al. 2013). Another laboratory study demonstrated that both additive chemicals and chemicals that accumulate in nature (nonylphenol, phenanthrene, PBDE-47 and triclosan) desorb from PVC and can transfer into the tissues of lug-worms upon ingestion (A. marina; Browne et al. 2013). Lastly, a study measur -
ing the bioaccumulation of POPs sorbed to plastics demonstrated the transfer of chrysene, PCB 28 and several congeners of PBDEs to fish from the ingestion of polyethylene pellets (Rochman et al. 2013b). Thus, there is strong evidence show-ing that chemical contaminants can bioaccumulate in marine life when plastic debris is ingested. What remains less understood, is whether these plastic-asso-ciated contaminants biomagnify in higher trophic level animals as a direct result of plastic ingestion (potentially leading to bioaccumulation of plastic-derived chemicals in seafood; Fig. 5.3) and how important bioaccumulation from plastic is relative to bioaccumulation from other sources of chemical contamination in the environment (e.g. chemical contamination that is ubiquitous in water, sediments and food webs globally; Ross and Birnbaum 2010). Still, the fact that chemicals from plastic debris can transfer to marine animals begs the question, how do these chemicals associated with plastic debris impact marine organisms?131
5 The Complex Mixture, Fate and Toxicity of Chemicals …
5.2  Toxicity of Plastic Debris to Marine Life
Hazardous substances may be emitted during all phases of the life cycle of a 
plastic product (Lithner et al. 2011; Galloway 2015). When the ultimate fate of a plastic product is the marine environment, plastic debris carries a cocktail of con-taminants, including those that accumulate on the material from the ocean water. If these chemicals become bioavailable, they can penetrate cells and chemically interact with biologically important molecules, and may cause adverse effects including changes in behavior (Browne et al. 2013), liver toxicity (Rochman et al. 
2013b) and endocrine disruption (Teuten et al. 2009; Rochman et al. 2014c). This section will discuss what is currently understood regarding the potential for chem-icals associated with marine plastic debris to impact marine organisms.
5.2.1  Hazards Associated with Plastic Ingredients
Several of the ingredients associated with plastics are considered hazardous by regulatory agencies (Lithner et al. 2011; Rochman 2013; Browne et al. 2013; USEPA 2013; European Commision 2014). Polymerization reactions are rarely 
complete and unpolymerized residual monomers can migrate off the plastic (Lithner et al. 2011). Moreover, additive ingredients are not usually bound to the polymer matrix, and often account for the major leaching and emissions of chemi-cal substances from plastic materials (Lithner et al. 2011; Engler et al. 2012). 
Release of hazardous substances, including phthalates, brominated flame retard-ants, bisphenol A, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, 4-nonylphenol and many vola-tile organic compounds, from plastic products has been shown (Crain et al. 2007; Lithner et al. 2012). As such, these chemicals may be bioavailable to marine life and thus there is potential for organisms to be impacted by the chemical ingredi-ents associated with plastic debris.
For some plastics, the monomer that makes up the polymer itself is classified as 
hazardous. For example, polyurethane foam, PVC, polycarbonate and high-impact polystyrene, are composed of monomers that are considered carcinogenic, muta-genic or toxic for reproduction (Lithner et al. 2011). Other monomers that have been described as the most environmentally hazardous are m-phenylenediamine, p-phenylenediamine, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and the phthalate plasticizer BBP (used as a monomer in some PVC), all of which have been found to be acutely toxic to aquatic life (Lithner et al. 2011).
Several plastics are composed of monomers considered to be non-hazardous 
(e.g. polyethylene and polypropylene), but contain harmful additives. Some of the most hazardous additives include brominated flame retardants, polyfluoronated compounds, triclosan, phthalate plasticizers and lead heat stabilizers (Halden et al. 2010; Lithner et al. 2011). Phthalates, for example, have been shown to target nuclear hormone receptor signaling pathways (Grün and Blumberg 2007) and cause endocrine disrupting effects in fish (Kim et al. 2002). Adverse effects 132 C.M. Rochman
related to the brominated flame-retardants include neurobehavioral development 
disorders, thyroid hormone alterations, teratogenicity and reduction in spawning success (Darnerud 2003; de Wit 2002). Other additives have hazardous degrada-
tion products. For example, nonylphenol is a degradation product of nonylphenol ethoxylates, a surfactant, and can cause endocrine disruption in fish (Gray and Metcalfe 1997; Seki et al. 2003; Kawahata et al. 2004).
When trying to understand how plastic debris may impact ocean organisms, 
it is critical to measure effects at environmentally relevant concentrations and under environmentally relevant exposure conditions (Rochman and Boxall 2014). While some evidence of toxicity for these substances occurs at levels greater than those found in the environment, for several chemical ingredients (e.g. phthalates and bisphenol A) adverse effects have been demonstrated at environmentally rel-evant concentrations (Crain et al. 2007; Oehlmann et al. 2009). Moreover, organ-
isms are rarely exposed to one chemical in isolation, and the interaction of several chemicals may induce synergistic effects. As such, when considering the impacts to organisms from plastic debris one must consider the complex mixture of chemi-cals associated with this material in the marine environment.
5.2.2  Hazards Associated with the Complex Mixture  
of Plastic and Sorbed Pollutants
Here, we will not focus on any physical adverse effects from the material itself, 
although it is worth noting that plastic debris may act as a multiple stressor to marine organisms as a result of the combination of both physical and chemical stressors (Rochman 2013). In this chapter, we will discuss the existing evidence of adverse chemical effects from the complex mixture of chemicals associated with plastic products and plastic marine debris. See Kühn et al. (2015) and Lusher (2015) for information regarding any adverse effects from plastic debris not related to the chemical impacts.
Some studies have assessed the toxicity of the leachates from plastic products. 
These incorporate adverse effects from the complex mixture of chemical ingre-dients associated with the material. One researcher exposed Daphnia magna to leachates from several plastic products and found that all leachates from PVC, polyurethane and epoxy products were acutely toxic (48-h EC50 s) at concentra-tions ranging from 2 to 235 grams of plastic per liter of water (Lithner et al. 2009, 2012). Another study found that most of the 500 plastic products sampled leached chemicals that had estrogenic activity, detected by an E-screen assay (Yang et al. 2011). Similarly, Wagner and Oehlmann (2009, 2011) detected estrogenic con-
tamination in PET water bottles, concluding that PET packaging materials are a source of estrogen-like compounds.
Moreover, when plastic becomes marine debris, it accumulates several other 
priority pollutants from the surrounding seawater, including several organic pol-lutants and metals. Ecotoxicological work has shown that priority pollutants such 133
5 The Complex Mixture, Fate and Toxicity of Chemicals …
as these can degrade the structure and functions of ecosystems. Key physiologi-
cal processes of organisms (e.g. cell-division, immunity, secretion of hormones) can be disrupted, causing disease (e.g. cancer; Zhuang et al. 2009; Vasseur and Cossu-Leguille 2006; Oehlmann et al. 2009) and reducing the ability to escape 
predators (Cartwright et al. 2006) and reproduce (Brown et al. 2004). Recently, 
some evidence has emerged regarding the impacts associated with the complex mixture of plastic and sorbed contaminants to organisms. One laboratory study found that the ingestion of PVC with sorbed triclosan altered feeding behavior and caused mortality in lugworms (A. marina; Browne et al. 2013). Another study fed fish polyethylene that had been deployed in the San Diego Bay, CA (i.e. allow-ing the plastic to accumulate environmentally relevant concentrations of priority pollutants). After a two-month dietary exposure to plastic with a complex mix-ture of sorbed priority pollutants (POPs and metals), fish suffered from liver tox-icity, including glycogen depletion, lipidosis, cellular death and tumor promotion (Rochman et al. 2013b) and showed signs of endocrine disruption via changes in gene expression and abnormal growth of germ cells in the gonads (Rochman et al. 2014c). In both studies, adverse effects were demonstrated from the plastic alone, but organisms suffered greater effects when exposed to the mixture of plastic with sorbed chemical contaminants (Browne et al. 2013; Rochman et al. 2013b), further supporting the idea that when assessing the hazards of plastic debris it is important to consider the complex mixture of plastic debris, chemical ingredients and any sorbed chemical contaminants.
5.3  Conclusion
There are many different plastic polymers and several thousand plastic additives. The combination of these makes a large variation in chemical composition of plas-tic products. The unique combination of chemical ingredients may render some types of plastic more hazardous than others when their chemical constituents are bioavailable to organisms. Moreover, the chemical properties of plastic facilitate the accumulation of relatively large concentrations of contaminants, producing a complex mixture of chemical contaminants on marine plastic debris. The mixture and concentrations of hazardous chemicals will vary based upon the plastic type, the location where the material is discarded and the time it is left in the aquatic environment. Research has shown that marine plastic debris may act as both a sink and a source for contaminants in the marine environment, including their trans-fer into marine foodwebs, and thus need to be considered in models assessing the environmental fate of contaminants in the ocean. Moreover, this complex mixture of contaminants associated with marine plastic debris should be considered under risk assessment for marine animals exposed to this debris. Assessing such hazards associated with plastic in aquatic habitats is not simple, and requires knowledge regarding organisms that may be exposed, the exposure concentrations, the types of polymers comprising the debris, the length of time the debris was present in the 134 C.M. Rochman
aquatic environment (affecting the size, shape and fouling) and the locations and 
transport of the debris during that time period.
Although the scientific understanding regarding the fate and consequences 
of this material in the environment is growing, there remain several gaps in our understanding regarding the cocktail of chemicals associated with marine plastic debris. To design effective management strategies for mitigating any impacts, pol-icy-makers will benefit from a greater understanding regarding the importance of plastic debris as a sink and source for global contaminants, its role in the global transport of chemicals substances, the bioaccumulation of plastic ingredients and accumulated chemical contaminants in wildlife, the importance of plastic as a mechanism for foodweb contamination relative to other sources of priority pol-lutants and whether or not these chemicals biomagnify in top predators (includ-ing humans) as a consequence of plastic debris entering marine foodwebs. Today, while researchers continue to expand our knowledge base, policy-makers can begin to act with the current information available, as there are no signs that the amount of plastic debris entering the marine environment is decreasing (Law et al. 2010; Goldstein et al. 2012) and if we continue business-as-usual the planet will hold another 33 billion tons of plastic by the year 2050 (Rochman 2013;  
Browne et al. 2013).

M. Bergmann et al. (eds.), Marine Anthropogenic Litter,  DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-16510-3_6Abstract Floating anthropogenic litter provides habitat for a diverse community 
of marine organisms. A total of 387 taxa, including pro- and eukaryotic micro-
organisms, seaweeds and invertebrates, have been found rafting on floating litter in all major oceanic regions. Among the invertebrates, species of bryozoans, crus-taceans, molluscs and cnidarians are most frequently reported as rafters on marine litter. Micro-organisms are also ubiquitous on marine litter although the compo-sition of the microbial community seems to depend on specific substratum char -
acteristics such as the polymer type of floating plastic items. Sessile suspension feeders are particularly well-adapted to the limited autochthonous food resources on artificial floating substrata and an extended planktonic larval development seems to facilitate colonization of floating litter at sea. Properties of floating litter, such as size and surface rugosity, are crucial for colonization by marine organ-isms and the subsequent succession of the rafting community. The rafters them-selves affect substratum characteristics such as floating stability, buoyancy, and degradation. Under the influence of currents and winds marine litter can transport associated organisms over extensive distances. Because of the great persistence (especially of plastics) and the vast quantities of litter in the world’s oceans, raft-ing dispersal has become more prevalent in the marine environment, potentially facilitating the spread of invasive species.

6.1  Introduction
Litter in the marine environment poses a hazard for a great variety of ani-
mals. Various species of marine vertebrates including fish, seabirds, turtles and marine mammals become easily entangled in floating marine litter, resulting in reduced mobility, strangulation and drowning (Derraik 2002; Kühn et al. 2015). Additionally, ingested litter can damage or block intestines, thereby affecting nutrition with often lethal effects (reviewed by Derraik 2002; Kühn et al. 2015). On the seafloor, marine litter can smother the substratum and thus cause hypoxia in benthic organisms (Moore 2008; Gregory 2009). In addition to these immediate hazardous effects on marine biota, marine litter has been suggested to facilitate the spread of non-indigenous species (Lewis et al. 2005). Biological invasions are considered a major threat to coastal ecosystems (Molnar et al. 2008).
Like any other submerged substrata, marine litter provides a habitat for organisms 
that are able to settle and persist on artificial surfaces. Once colonized by marine biota, litter items floating at the sea surface can facilitate dispersal of the associated rafters at different spatial scales. Previous studies have reported over 1200 taxa that are associ-ated with natural and anthropogenic flotsam (Thiel and Gutow 2005a) and the extreme localities that rafting organisms can reach when transported over large distances by currents and wind (Barnes and Fraser 2003; Barnes and Milner 2005). While floating macroalgae, wood and volcanic pumice have been part of the natural flotsam assem-blage of the oceans for millions of years, marine litter adds a new dimension to the dispersal opportunities of potential rafters (Barnes 2002). Marine litter is diverse (e.g. domestic waste, derelict fishing gear, detached buoys), persistent (afloat for longer than many natural substrata-Thiel and Gutow 2005b; Bravo et al. 2011), widespread 
(Barnes et al. 2009; Eriksen et al. 2014) and abounds in oceanic regions where natural 
floating substrata, such as macroalgae, occur less frequently (Rothäusler et al. 2012).
Unlike biotic substrata, anthropogenic litter is of no nutritional value to most 
organisms. Additionally, marine litter items differ from natural substrata in their physical and chemical characteristics such as surface rugosity and floating behav-ior. Accordingly, rafters need to overcome specific challenges with regard to food acquisition and attachment in order to persist for extended time periods on artifi-cial floating substrata. The specific properties of marine litter are likely to influ-ence colonization and succession processes, and thus the composition of the associated rafting community (Bravo et al. 2011).
In this chapter, we compiled information from peer-reviewed scientific litera-
ture on the biota associated with marine floating litter and on characteristics of lit-ter items that affect the composition of the rafting community. Information on the biological traits of species associated with floating marine litter was used to char -
acterize the rafting assemblage’s functionally and to identify specific conditions that rafters on floating marine litter have to cope with. Finally, the environmental 143

implications of litter rafting will be discussed, including the dispersal and invasion 
potential of non-indigenous species.
6.2  Floating Litter as a Habitat
Marine flotsam can be classified according to its nature (abiotic or biotic) and its origin (natural or anthropogenic). Biotic flotsam comprises macroalgae, animal remains/carcasses, wood and other parts of terrestrial plants such as seeds and leaf litter. Abiotic flotsam of natural origin consists mostly of volcanic pumice and ice. Flotsam of anthropogenic origin includes every kind of discarded material: biotic anthropogenic flotsam consists mainly of manufactured wood, discarded food (e.g. fruits) and oil/tar lumps, but the great majority of anthropogenic flotsam is abiotic and comprises any artificial object at sea.
Floating marine litter consists of consumer and household articles, industrial waste 
products or objects that had previously served maritime and fishery purposes (Fig. 6.1).

Discarded or lost consumer articles usually start their floating journey in a “clean” 
state, i.e. free of fouling biota. Floating litter from maritime activities comprises detached buoys, discarded fishing gear and chunks of piers and harbor infrastructure. These objects usually have spent long time periods in the marine environment, and therefore often host an extensive and reproductively active fouling biota, before they become part of marine floating litter, e.g. after detachment from anchorings. For exam-ple, Astudillo et al. (2009) found diverse rafting communities in advanced successional stages on lost aquaculture buoys floating off the Chilean coast. Detached buoys might carry with them anchoring lines, which extend into greater depths, thereby offering a habitat less influenced by harsh surface conditions. Highly buoyant items, such as Styrofoam, often have low floating stability and tip over more easily, a process, which suppresses colonization by fouling organisms (Bravo et al. 2011). However, coloniza-tion by fouling organisms may stabilize the floating item, equivalent to the “biologi-cal keel” of attached organisms on floating pumice described by Bryan et al. (2012). Accordingly, the degree of colonization has substantial impact on the floating behavior of the substratum at sea and therefore on the succession of the rafting community.
The rafting community on litter is described as being similar to but less spe-
cies rich than that of floating macroalgae (Stevens et al. 1996; Winston et al. 1997; Gregory 2009). Winston et al. (1997) attribute this partly to the higher structural 
complexity and the soft mechanical properties of macroalgae compared to smooth and hard plastic particles. In contrast, Barnes and Milner (2005) report a signifi-cantly higher amount of encrusting organisms on floating wood and plastic com-pared to floating kelp. Only few studies allow for a comparison of the rafting communities on different marine litter substrata, probably because the vast majority of the floating litter is composed of plastics. Wong et al. (1974) found similar organ-
isms colonizing larger plastic items and tar lumps of the same size. In a coloniza-tion experiment, organisms settled rapidly on floating substrata regardless of its type (plastic, Styrofoam or pumice—Bravo et al. 2011). However, in an early stage of colonization fewer species were found on plastic surfaces than on Styrofoam and pumice, indicating that surface rugosity of the substratum facilitates initial coloniza-tion of floating objects (Bravo et al. 2011—Fig. 6.2). Similarly, Carson et al. (2013) 
observed more diatoms, though not bacteria, on rough surfaces.
Only few studies have considered the material differences between types of plas-
tic. Though there is no evidence that the polymer type is relevant for the composi-tion of the rafting macrobiota, it was shown that it influences the composition of micro-organisms: Carson et al. (2013) found significantly more bacteria on polysty-rene than on polyethylene and polypropylene, probably because of the surface char -
acteristics of the material. Zettler et al. (2013) found distinct bacterial assemblages on polypropylene and polyethylene with a compositional overlap of less than 50 %.
Biotic flotsam occurs in a wide size range with floating macroalgae and tree 
trunks often reaching several metres in diameter or length. The majority of abi-otic flotsam is generally smaller and rarely reaches a size of 1 m (Thiel and Gutow 2005b). Marine litter of any size, ranging from fragments in the order of millime-tres (Gregory 1978; Minchin 1996) to larger items, such as lost buoys (Astudillo et al. 2009) and even refrigerators (Dellinger et al. 1997) are colonized by organ-isms. Carson et al. (2013) found that a larger surface area of plastic fragments is 145
6 Marine Litter as Habitat and Dispersal Vector
associated with a higher taxonomic richness, though not necessarily abundance, 
of microbiota. Similarly, Goldstein et  al. (2014 ) recorded a positive correlation 
between the surface area of floating litter items in the North Pacific and species 
richness of the rafting community (Fig.  6.3). Most of these larger litter items con -
sisted of fishing gear, which are more likely to harbor a diverse biota before being 
discarded or lost than are smaller domestic litter items. Other possible explanations 
involve stochastic effects (a random distribution of organisms on marine flotsam 
leads to a higher quantity on larger items), biased sampling efforts (small items 
sink already when colonized by only few organisms) or other raft characteristics, 
e.g. stability (Goldstein et  al. 2014 ). A floating experiment conducted by Ye and 
Andrady ( 1991 ) revealed that larger surfaces are more quickly colonized by macro -
biota than smaller surfaces. Wong et  al. (1974 ) did not find algae and invertebrates 
on plastic fragments, which were significantly smaller than floating pumice in the

same region. Lepadid barnacles seem to have species-specific preferences for litter 
of certain size, and some species (Lepas pectinata and Dosima fascicularis) associ-ated with smaller litter items develop morphological adaptations, such as a small body size and light-weight valves, that minimize the risk of sinking of colonized flotsam (Whitehead et al. 2011). A size-specific selection of floating substrata has previously been shown for lepadid barnacles rafting on tar pellets (Minchin 1996).
Abiotic and biotic flotsam differ in their expected longevity. The persistence 
of biotic flotsam, such as floating seaweeds, is clearly limited by physical factors such as temperature and biological processes such as consumption and decomposi-tion (Vandendriessche et al. 2007; Rothäusler et al. 2009). Therefore, the longev-ity of floating macroalgae is in the range of a few weeks up to six months (Thiel and Gutow 2005b). Floating litter is of no nutritional value for metazoans, and so far only few microorganisms have been shown capable of plastic digestion (Zettler et al. 2013). Accordingly, biological degradation is slow and marine litter, especially plastic, is expected to persist for years or even centuries in the marine environment (Derraik 2002; O’Brine and Thompson 2010). Plastics are particularly persistent 
at sea because lower temperatures and oxygen levels decelerate decomposition processes (Andrady 2011). Attached biota may protect the raft from degradation through solar radiation (Winston et al. 1997), thereby further extending its lifetime.
Estimating the time a floating item has spent in the marine environment is com-
plicated and at present no reliable method exists. Age estimations for floating litter are inferred from (a) drift trajectories and velocities based on the supposed origin of the items (Ebbesmeyer and Ingraham 1992; Rees and Southward 2009; Hoeksema et al. 2012), (b) the successional stage of the rafting community (Cundell 1974), 
(c) the size of rafting organisms of known growth rates, e.g. bryozoans or lepa-did barnacles (Stevens 1992 cited by Winston et al. 1997; Barnes and Fraser 2003; Tsikhon-Lukanina et al. 2001), or (d) the degradation of the substratum, for exam-ple by measuring the tensile extensibility of the material (Andrady 2011). However, all these methods have drawbacks, introducing a high degree of uncertainty to age  estimates for floating litter. The sources of litter items are often unknown and floating 
velocities can be highly variable due to seasonal variations in wind and current con-ditions. Additionally, the composition and the successional stage of the rafting com-munity may change the floating behavior of a litter item. Biological interactions such as predation and competition may influence the composition and the age structure of a rafting community rendering the size of specific rafting organisms an unreliable predictor of the duration of the floating period. Moreover, unlike floating macroal-gae, abiotic flotsam may repeatedly return to the sea even after extended periods on the shore, which likely influences the state of degradation of the raft as well as the composition of the associated biota. Bravo et al. (2011) discussed that degradation of marine litter may either facilitate colonization by producing more rugose surfaces or alternatively impede it by abrasion processes. Overall, degradation and fragmentation of litter items into smaller pieces reduces the size of individual rafts, thereby chang-ing settlement opportunities for species of a certain size range.
Removal of floating litter rafts from the sea surface occurs through stranding, 
sinking or ingestion by aquatic animals. Sinking of litter rafts mostly occurs because 147

of high epibiont biomass that increases the weight of a floating object (Barnes et al. 
2009; Bravo et al. 2011). Depending on environmental conditions, a critical accu-mulation of biomass that forces a substratum to sink can develop within 8–10 weeks on smaller household plastic items and plastic bags (Ye and Andrady 1991). Sinking 
flotsam may facilitate the transport of associated organisms to the seafloor. However, subsequent establishment of rafters in the benthic environment is unlikely, especially in the deep sea. The loss of buoyancy is reversible if epibionts die at greater water depth and fall off their substratum (Ye and Andrady 1991). Consequentially, the item may resurface, initiating a new cycle of colonization. Rafting organisms likely bene-fit from neutral buoyancy of a litter item because they are less exposed to desiccation and solar radiation on a substratum that barely emerges above the sea surface (Bravo et al. 2011; Carson et al. 2013). Vertical export of litter into deeper waters may be 
facilitated by wind-driven mixing or eddies (Kukulka et al. 2012).
6.3  Composition of Rafting Assemblages on Floating Litter
6.3.1  Taxonomic Overview
A review of 82 publications revealed a total of 387 marine litter rafting taxa, of which 244 were identified to the species, and 143 to the genus level (for complete species list see Appendix 1). In this review we included publications that report on organisms associated with floating litter in the field as well as experimental studies on the colonization of anthropogenic flotsam. We did not consider the many exper -
imental studies on the succession of fouling communities on rigidly fixed artificial substrata because these items do not display the specific floating behavior, which probably affects the colonization by marine biota. To avoid potential overlaps, taxa identified at genus level were excluded if a species-level identification existed for the same genus. The identification of some micro-organisms was vague despite the use of advanced analytical methods such as electron microscopy and RNA analy-sis. Most taxa (335) were associated with plastic substrata (domestic waste, plastic fragments or buoys made of plastic), which constitute the large majority of anthro-pogenic floating litter in the oceans (Galgani et al. 2015). Accordingly, only few 
taxa (17) were recorded from other floating litter items consisting of metal, glass and paper. For 83 taxa, the floating substrata were of unknown composition or were composed of various materials. The given numbers exceed the total number of 387 taxa because some species have been found on more than just one substra-tum type. 132 taxa were recorded from items, which previously served maritime purposes (mainly buoys and fishing gear). A large proportion (60 %) of the rafting taxa was sampled in situ, associated with their floating substrata, whereas 35 % of the taxa are only known from beached litter. For 2 %, the ability to raft on floating litter was inferred from floating experiments (Bravo et al. 2011) and the remaining 3 % consist of taxa that could not be reliably identified but were assigned to a cer -
tain genus or species by the respective authors.148 T. Kiessling et al.
The highest numbers of rafting taxa on floating litter were found in the Pacific 
and North Atlantic, which might be explained by the overall high research effort 
undertaken in these regions (Fig.  6.4). A considerable number of rafters were also 
found in the Mediterranean while only few taxa were reported from the South 
Atlantic and from the Indian Ocean. Some rafters have even been found in the 
Arctic at 79°N (Barnes and Milner 2005 ) and in Antarctica at approximately 67°S 
(Barnes and Fraser 2003 ). The percentage of anthropogenic litter items colonized 
varied significantly with latitude. Barnes and Milner ( 2005 ) found that at low lati -
tudes (0–15°) about 50  % of all beached litter items were colonized by marine 
biota while at higher latitudes (15–40°) only 25  % of the litter items had attached 
organisms. This rate decreased further to 5–10  % at 40–60° latitude and beyond 
60° colonization of marine litter was rarely observed (Fig.  6.5). This geographic 
pattern was evident for remote sites as well as for sites close to the continental 
shore (Barnes 2002 ). A similar latitudinal decrease of the colonization rate was 
evident on a smaller spatial scale for the Indian Ocean (Barnes 2004 ).
Numerous taxa of bacteria, protists and algae (most prominently diatoms and 
Rhodophyta) form part of the rafting community on marine floating litter (Table  6.1). 
Four studies examined the microbiota associated with marine microplastics (i.e. plas -
tic particles in the size range of millimetres and a few centimetres—Fortuño et  al. 
2010 ; Carson et  al. 2013 ; Zettler et  al. 2013 ; Reisser et  al. 2014 ) and found a total

6 Marine Litter as Habitat and Dispersal Vector
of 44 bacteria and 56 Chromista taxa. Micro-organisms seem to be ubiquitous on 
marine litter as Carson et  al. (2013 ) found microbes on each plastic item sampled in 
the North Pacific gyre. Plastic litter offers a habitat for various functional microbial 
groups including autotrophs, symbionts, heterotrophs (including phagotrophs) and 
predators (Zettler et  al. 2013 ). Harmful micro-organisms were also found on floating 
litter, including potential human and animal pathogens of the genus Vibrio  (Zettler 
et al. 2013 ), the ciliate Halofolliculina  sp., which causes skeletal eroding band disease 
in corals (Goldstein et  al. 2014 ) and the dinoflagellates Ostreopsis  sp., Coolia  sp. and 
Alexandrium taylori , known to form harmful algal blooms under favorable conditions 
(Masó et  al. 2003 ). The composition of the microbial community clearly differs from 
the surrounding seawater suggesting that plastic litter forms a novel habitat for micro -
biota (termed ‘microbial reef’ by Zettler et  al. 2013 ). Some organisms found on plas -
tic samples are otherwise strictly associated with open seawater and their presence 
was probably the result of entanglement (Zettler et  al. 2013 ). Carson et  al. (2013 ) 
characterized the encountered microbial community in the North Pacific gyre as 
dominated by rod-shaped bacteria and pennate diatoms, each at densities of roughly 
1,000  cells m−2. Less frequent microbiota on plastic samples comprised coccoid bac -
teria, centric diatoms, dinoflagellates, coccolithophores, and radiolarians. A surpris -
ingly low morphological diversity among the abundant diatoms was mentioned.
Macroalgae have occasionally been found attached to floating marine lit -
ter, among them red (11 taxa), brown (6 taxa) and some green algae (4 taxa). 
However, rarely was a single taxon encountered more than once. Diatoms (29 
taxa), dinoflagellates (5 taxa) and foraminiferans (7 taxa) seem to be more com -
mon, although likewise, very few taxa were reported more than once, probably 
owing to the low number of studies focusing on micro-organisms.
The most common invertebrate groups on marine litter are crustaceans, bryozo -
ans, molluscs and cnidarians (Table  6.1). The composition of taxa retrieved from 
beached litter tends to be biased towards sessile organisms with hard (calcified) struc -
tures such as bryozoans, foraminiferans, tubeworms and barnacles (Stevens et  al. 
1996 ; Winston et  al. 1997 ; Gregory 2009 ). Mobile organisms such as crustaceans and 
annelids are more frequently observed on rafts collected while afloat (Astudillo et  al. 
2009 ; Goldstein et  al. 2014 ). Some taxa have repeatedly been observed associated 
with floating litter (Fig.  6.4) and thus, may not just be accidental rafters.Fig. 6.5  Proportion of

6 Marine Litter as Habitat and Dispersal Vector
Stalked barnacles of the genus Lepas are by far the most frequently encoun-
tered hitchhikers in all major oceanic regions except for the Arctic and Southern 
Ocean. Seven Lepas species have been found rafting on litter, the most frequently observed and widespread being L. anatifera and L. pectinata. Lepas are prominent 
fouling species and readily colonize a variety of floating objects, a process likely facilitated by their extended planktonic larval stage (Southward 1987).
Isopods of the genus Idotea are frequently found on marine litter in the 
Atlantic, Pacific and Mediterranean. While I. metallica and I. baltica have repeat-edly been reported on floating litter items other species such as I. emarginata are less common. Idotea metallica is an obligate rafter without benthic populations, and the constant replenishment of an otherwise not self-sustaining population in the North Sea illustrates its conformity with the rafting environment (Gutow and Franke 2001). Idotea metallica shows specific adaptations to the rafting life-style 
such as reduced “locomotive activity and a tight association to the substratum” and low food requirements compared to its congener I. baltica (Gutow et al. 2006, 2007). The latter species predominantly colonizes algal rafts, which are rapidly consumed by this voracious herbivore (Gutow 2003; Vandendriessche et al. 2007).
Other frequently encountered crustaceans include the three pelagic species of 
crab, Planes major, P . marinus and P . minutus, found in the Atlantic, Pacific and 
Indian Ocean; and five species of the diverse amphipod genus Caprella, whose members show morphological adaptations in the form of reduced abdominal appendages enabling them to cling to flotsam (Takeuchi and Sawamoto 1998).
Bryozoans from the closely related genera Membranipora and Jellyella were 
found rafting on marine litter in the Atlantic, Pacific, Mediterranean and even in Arctic waters. Jellyella tuberculata was the most frequently encountered spe-
cies in the Atlantic and Pacific and is known to colonize a wide range of sub-strata including plastic litter and macroalgae (Winston et al. 1997). The species typically occurs at tropical and subtropical latitudes (Gregory 1978), however, 
sightings on marine litter are reported from all major oceanic regions with the exception of polar seas (Fig. 6.4). The most common gastropod on floating litter, Fiona pinnata, was sighted in the Pacific and Mediterranean. According to Willan (1979), F . pinnata has a cosmopolitan distribution and commonly inhabits floating 
wood and macroalgae where it can exploit its Lepas prey, growing on the same substratum.Kingdom Phylum Class Order Number of taxa

6.3.2  Biological Traits of Rafting Invertebrates  
on Floating Litter
Given the specific habitat conditions on floating marine litter, it can be expected 
that certain biological traits will predominate among the assemblage of rafting organisms. Of the 215 invertebrate species considered for this analysis, 25 (12 %) have been classified as obligate rafters that live exclusively on floating objects. 165 species (77 %) are facultative rafters that occupy benthic habitats as well. For 25 species (12 %) the available information was not sufficient to determine their raft 
status.
6.3.2.1  Mobility
Fifty-nine percent of the rafting species on floating litter are fully sessile whereas 
5 % of the species can be classified as semi-sessile (with the ability to detach and re-attach). Only 27 % of the reported species are mobile, for the remaining spe-cies the information was insufficient. In contrast to these numbers, Astudillo et al. (2009) and Goldstein et al. (2014) found more mobile than sessile taxa on floating litter, indicating that the inclusion of studies from beached litter is likely leading to an underestimation of mobile taxa. Nevertheless, the high proportion of sessile and semi-sessile species highlights the necessity for a firm attachment of rafting species to the often smooth and solid abiotic surfaces of floating litter items. It further illustrates the often low structural complexity of litter items compared to, for example, floating macroalgae which host a much higher proportion of mobile species that can efficiently cling to the often complex algal thalli with numerous branches and highly structured holdfasts (Thiel and Gutow 2005a). Disadvantages for sessile organisms arise when unstable rafts change positions and expose organisms to surface conditions (Bravo et al. 2011), or if the raft sinks or strands (Winston 2012).
6.3.2.2  Feeding Biology
The great majority (72 %) of the rafting taxa on marine floating litter are suspen-
sion feeders whereas only 7 % of the species feed as grazers and borers, and 9 % as predators and scavengers (for the remaining 12 % no feeding mode could be identi-fied). The high proportion of suspension feeders on marine litter is not surprising. Abiotic floating substrata are of no nutritional value for associated rafters, making them dependent on food from the surrounding environment. On floating seaweeds, which are consumed by associated herbivores, the proportion of suspension feed-ers is substantially lower (approx. 40 %) and the proportion of grazers and borers higher (approx. 20 %—Thiel and Gutow 2005a). Rafting suspension feeders ben-efit from the concentration of their rafts and suspended organic material in surface 153
6 Marine Litter as Habitat and Dispersal Vector
fronts generated by the convergence of surface waters, wind-induced Langmuir 
cells and other surface features (Woodcock 1993; Marmorino et al. 2011). The accumulation of suspended matter and nutrients in these convergence zones appar -
ently fuels diverse rafting communities on floating abiotic substrata, which also encompass primary producers, herbivores, and predators.
6.3.2.3  Reproductive Traits
Forty-eight percent of the rafting invertebrate species on marine floating  litter 
reproduce sexually (of which 42 % are hermaphroditic and 58 % are gonochoric) 
and 38 % have, at least theoretically, the ability to reproduce both sexually and asexually while for 14 % of the species no information on the reproductive mode is available. Bryozoans, constituting most of the species that are capable of  asexual and sexual reproduction, reproduce primarily asexually. This facilitates 
establishment and rapid local spread. However, encrusting bryozoans seem to reproduce exclusively sexually (Thomsen and Hakansson 1995). Bryozoans also perform “spermcast mating” where sperm is accumulated from the surrounding water and stored prior to fertilization (Bishop and Pemberton 2006), a strategy which appears particularly beneficial for rafting organisms because there may be no (or only few) conspecifics nearby. If bryozoans grow in isolation many have the ability to self-fertilize rather than to rely on neighbouring colonies (Maturo 1991 cited by Winston et al. 1997).
About 9 % of the rafting species on marine litter have benthic larvae or  larvae 
with a short pelagic development of less than two days and 12 % release fully developed individuals. Thirty percent of the species have pelagic larvae with an extended planktonic phase of up to several weeks. For 49 % of the invertebrate species no details on larval biology were available. Winston et al. (1997) suggest that long-lived larvae may be beneficial for settlement on litter floating in the open ocean, although upwelling events and storms may facilitate the colonization of lit-ter items by species with short larval development. Astudillo et al. (2009) found mainly rafters with short larval development or direct development on floating buoys in the south-eastern Pacific, a region under influence of upwelling regimes. Stevens et al. (1996) also reported many bryozoans with short larval development on beached litter in northern New Zealand. Given the long distances floating litter can travel, some stranded items may have been under the influence of upwelling regions as described for the South Taranaki Bight (summarized by Foster and Battaerd 1985), approximately 500 km to the south of the sampled location.
6.3.3  Other Species Attracted to Marine Litter
Fishes and other marine vertebrates and invertebrates are known to aggregate around floating objects at sea (for example Hunter and Mitchell 1967; Taquet et al. 154 T. Kiessling et al.
2007). Aliani and Molcard (2003) observed dolphins, sea turtles and fish below 
larger items (mostly plastics) in the Mediterranean. Fish that aggregate below rafts (of natural or anthropogenic origin) may also become dispersed over long oceanic distances, occasionally even crossing oceanic barriers (Luiz et al. 2012). Possibly, the increasing number of observations of raft-associated fish species near oceanic islands (e.g. Afonso et al. 2013) is due to increasing densities of floating litter in these regions (e.g. Law et al. 2010). It is still not well known why fish aggre-gate around floating objects, especially because they are rarely observed feeding on organisms living on flotsam (e.g. Ibrahim et al. 1996). On the other hand, fish and shark bite marks in plastic litter might indicate that fishes prey actively on the biota on floating litter (Winston et al. 1997; Carson 2013). A review by Castro et al. (2002) concludes that the reasons why fish aggregate around floating objects, and especially macroalgae assemblages, may be manifold, including serving as a refuge, a source for food, and a meeting point for solitary fish. Seabirds may acci-dentally ingest litter items if they confuse artificial flotsam such as Styrofoam with food (e.g. van Franeker 1985; Kühn et al. 2015). Some species may also ingest  litter while feeding on the organisms growing on small litter items.
6.3.4  Succession of the Rafting Community
The colonization of artificial floating substrata follows a general pattern that has 
been investigated experimentally in several studies (Ye and Andrady 1991; Artham et al. 2009; Bravo et al. 2011; Lobelle and Cunliffe 2011): first, a biofilm con-sisting of bacteria and biopolymers develops within hours after submergence. This first phase is primarily controlled by the physico-chemical properties of the sub-stratum (such as rugosity and hydrophobicity) whereas biological processes seem less important at this stage (Artham et al. 2009). The exact development and com-position of the biofilm is highly variable, even on similar substrata at the same site (Ye and Andrady 1991) and probably influenced by seasonal (Artham et al. 2009) 
and other environmental variables (temperature, salinity—Carson et al. 2013). The composition of the initial colonizer assemblage affects the further succession of the fouling community (Ye and Andrady 1991; Bravo et al. 2011), although bryo-zoans readily colonize clean substrata without a biofilm (Maki et al. 1989; Zardus et al. 2008). In general, invertebrates and macroalgae may colonize submerged 
substrata within three to four weeks (Ye and Andrady 1991; Bravo et al. 2011). Results from a fouling experiment conducted by Dean and Hurd (1980) suggest that initial colonization of organisms on artificial substrata may facilitate some later arrivers but inhibit others.
The settlement of invertebrates seems to depend mainly on the availability of 
propagules (larvae and juveniles) in the surrounding environment (Stevens et al. 1992 cited by Winston et al. 1997; Barnes 2002) but less on the distance from the coast (Barnes 2002). Further information on later successional stages of raft-ing communities on floating litter has been collected from floating and stranded 155
6 Marine Litter as Habitat and Dispersal Vector
substrata and from experiments: during an experimental exposure of different 
plastic items for 13–19  weeks, an initial biofilm with green algae was replaced 
after seven weeks by hydroid colonies followed by bryozoans and ascidians (Ye 
and Andrady 1991 ). Bravo et  al. (2011 ) found a peak in taxonomic richness on 
abiotic substrata (plastics, Styrofoam and pumice) that had been submerged for 
eight weeks. The community was initially dominated by diatoms, whereas later 
successional stages were characterized by hydrozoans (mainly Obelia  sp.), bar -
nacles ( Austromegabalanus psittacus ) and an ascidian ( Diplosoma  sp.). Tsikhon-
Lukanina et  al. (2001 ), studying natural and anthropogenic flotsam in the western 
North Pacific, recognized a bryozoan-dominated phase with a higher abundance 
of polychaetes and gastropods, followed by a lepadid barnacle phase with a 
higher incidence of malacostracan crustaceans, especially amphipods (Fig.  6.6). 
Turbellarians increased in abundance and biomass throughout the experimental 
duration. Winston et  al. (1997 ) found no signs of succession on beached litter in 
Florida and Bermuda, which may have been obscured by the state of desiccated 
animals. In contrast to the initial biofilm formation, later successional stages are 
much more controlled by biological processes. For example, the bryozoan Electra 
tenella  occurs exclusively on plastic items (floating off the U.S. Atlantic coast), 
thereby avoiding competition, mainly with Membranipora tuberculata , which fre -
quently overgrows E. tenella  on natural substrata (Winston 1982 ).
6.4  Floating Litter as Dispersal Vector
Floating litter can facilitate the dispersal of associated organisms when moved 
across the ocean surface by winds and currents. The efficiency of rafting dis -
persal depends on the availability and the persistence of floating substrata in the 
oceans. Already established populations may disperse regionally with the help of 
marine litter, as was observed by Whitehead et  al. (2011 ) for lepadid barnacles 
in South Africa, by Serrano et  al. (2013 ) for a Mediterranean population of the 
coral Oculina patagonica  and also by Davidson ( 2012 ) for the isopod Sphaeroma Fig. 6.6  Succession of a 
rafting community on floating 
objects, among them marine 
litter. The y-axis gives the 
share of the respective taxa in

quoianum, which “manufactures” its own raft by causing fragmentation of 
Styrofoam/polystyrene dock floats.
Several taxa, including potential invaders, were found on marine litter far 
beyond their natural dispersal range: stranded barnacles (of the genera Dosima, 
Lepas and Perforatus) were observed in Ireland and Wales (having spent con-siderable time rafting in the North Atlantic), though individuals were not found alive (Minchin 1996; Rees and Southward 2009). Studies from the Netherlands 
report the reef coral Favia fragum, also dead and having rafted from the Caribbean (Hoeksema et al. 2012, Fig. 6.1a) and shell parts of the bivalve Pinctada imbri-cata (Cadée 2003). Barnes and Milner (2005) recorded Austrominius modestus (as Elminius modestus), an exotic invader, on drift plastic on the Shetland Islands 
(Scotland, UK), although this was not the first record of that barnacle there. By far the biggest piece of long-distance-rafting flotsam is described by Choong and Calder (2013): A 188-ton piece of a former dock, dislodged during a tsunami in Japan in 2011, stranded in Oregon and offered a rafting opportunity for over 100 species, non-native to the U.S. coast. Several other large pieces of tsunami debris of the same origin transported further species to the North Pacific east coast (Calder et al. 2014).
To successfully establish a founding population rafting organisms not only have 
to survive the journey but be able to reproduce upon reaching a potential habitat. In general, colonial organisms have the highest potential to successfully establish in new habitats as every individual “represents a potential founder population” (Winston 2012). Reproductively active organisms have been observed on numer -
ous occasions, including bryozoans, as far south as Adelaide Island, Antarctica (Barnes and Fraser 2003), and egg-bearing crustaceans in many different regions (e.g. Spivak and Bas 1999; Gutow and Franke 2003; Poore 2012; Cabezas et al. 2013). Resting cysts of dinoflagellates attached to plastic have been observed (Masó et al. 2003) as well as egg masses of gastropods, even though no adult spec-imens were present (Winston et al. 1997; Bravo et al. 2011). The pelagic insects Halobates sericeus (Goldstein et al. 2012) and H. micans (Majer et al. 2012) are 
known to deposit eggs on marine plastics, and the ubiquity of this substratum helps these species to overcome limitations of suitable oviposition sites.
On numerous occasions, rafting taxa have been reported for the very first time 
on marine litter in a given region (Jara and Jaramillo 1979; Stevens et al. 1996; Winston et al. 1997; Cadée 2003), a mentionable feat considering the stochas-tic nature of rafting events. Like other floating substrata marine litter is under the influence of winds and currents, but due to high buoyancy some litter items may be pushed along different trajectories than other flotsam, such as mostly sub-merged macroalgae. However, unlike other potential dispersal vectors for inva-sive species, especially transport by ship (ballast water and hull fouling), it is not expected that marine litter opens up novel pathways that are not available for other floating substrata (Lewis et al. 2005).
Given the high persistence of marine litter and the enormous abundances in 
the world’s oceans (Eriksen et al. 2014) it becomes evident that the littering of the oceans with plastics over the past decades has substantially enhanced rafting 157
6 Marine Litter as Habitat and Dispersal Vector
opportunities for marine organisms, and it is estimated that floating marine litter 
doubles or even triples the dispersal of marine organisms (Barnes 2002, however doubted by Lewis et al. 2005). The implications of the increasing amounts of long-lived floating substrata in the oceans are pointed out by Goldstein et al. (2012) who suggest that the populations of the ocean skater H. sericeus are no longer lim-ited by the availability of floating objects, used for egg attachment. Similar effects may be responsible for the reported population expansion of other common rafters (e.g. Winston 1982 for Electra tenella).
More importantly, floating litter is not only more abundant than natural float-
ing substrata in many parts of the world’s oceans, but its abundances are chroni-cally high, throughout all seasons and across years. This continuous presence of large amounts of floating litter contrasts strongly with the highly episodic appear -
ance of pumice rafting opportunities (e.g. Bryan et al. 2012) and few natural raft-ing opportunities in tropical waters (Rothäusler et al. 2012). It is likely that this change in the temporal and spatial availability of abiotic rafts dramatically affects the dynamics of rafting transport and colonization by associated organisms.
6.5  Summary and Outlook
In an earlier global compilation Thiel and Gutow (2005a) listed 108 invertebrate species that have been found rafting on plastics in the ocean. Since then the list of rafting invertebrates on marine litter (including plastics and other  anthropogenic 
litter) has almost doubled to 215 species. Additionally, some recent studies revealed the ubiquity of micro-organisms on marine litter. Sessile suspension  feeders seem to be particularly well adapted to life on solid artificial substrata 
with specific surface characteristics and limited autochthonous food supply. The colonization of floating litter items is apparently facilitated by larvae with an extended planktonic development. Sexual and asexual reproduction is equally common among rafting species on marine litter with asexual reproduction prob-ably allowing for rapid monopolization, especially of colonial species (e.g. bryo-zoans) on isolated floating substrata. Physical characteristics of the raft, such as surface rugosity and floating behavior, are crucial for colonization processes and  subsequent succession of the rafting invertebrate community. The associ-
ated organisms themselves can influence the persistence and stability of their raft indicating complex interaction between the rafting substratum and the associated biota.
Abundant floating marine litter has been suggested to facilitate the spread of 
invasive species and, in fact, some species have been observed rafting on marine litter beyond their natural distributional limits. Marine litter has probably not opened new rafting routes in the oceans. However, the permanent availability of high densities of persistent floating litter items, especially in regions where  natural 
flotsam occurs in low densities or only episodically, has substantially increased rafting opportunities for species that are able to persist on abiotic flotsam. 158 T. Kiessling et al.
Accordingly, the continuous supply of individuals from distant up-current regions 
probably facilitates the establishment of species in new regions.
Recent studies have not only enhanced our understanding of the role of marine 
litter as a habitat and dispersal vector for marine biota but also revealed open ques-tions that clearly deserve more research effort. Ocean current models have been used to identify drift trajectories and major accumulation zones of floating marine litter in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Ocean (Lebreton et al. 2012; Maximenko et al. 2012), which could be confirmed by field surveys (see for example Law et al. 2010; Goldstein et al. 2013). These models are primarily based on drift trajectories 
of surface buoys equipped with drogues extending several metres below the sea surface and are thus suitable for identifying broad distributional patterns and large-scale accumulation zones of litter in the oceans. In coastal waters, currents are much more variable and complex and litter objects floating at the sea surface are more strongly influenced by wind than common drifter buoys (e.g. Astudillo et al. 2009). However, our knowledge on how wind and currents influence the floating behavior of different litter items is limited (Neumann et al. 2014). Experimental studies on the floating speed and direction of different categories of floating lit-ter under the influence of variable wind and current conditions would improve our abilities to model floating trajectories of marine litter, predict potential rafting routes, and identify sources of marine floating litter.
Persistence of a litter item in the sea is crucial for its suitability as a habitat 
and dispersal vector for marine biota. However, the dynamics of degradation of the various litter types under variable marine environmental conditions are poorly understood. Likewise, more research is required to understand how marine biota can accelerate or decelerate degradation processes of marine litter. Investigations on the degradation processes should combine in situ monitoring of litter items in the marine environment and biochemical laboratory studies, e.g. on the enzymatic decomposition of plastic polymers.
The degradation of plastics may induce the release of chemicals, some of which 
are known to affect the health of marine organisms (Rochman 2015). The role of ingested microplastics for the transport of contaminants to marine biota may be limited also because of the rapid gut passage of the small particles (Koelmans 2015). However, the firm attachment of a sessile organism to an artificial surface is permanent and it is yet unknown whether this form of chronic exposure might allow for a slow but continuous transfer of contaminants from plastics to animals via epithelia or with chemically enriched water from the micro-layer on the plas-tic surface. These studies would require laboratory measurements on the chemical load and the health status of litter rafters, but should also involve organisms col-lected from litter at sea.
Combined, new and sound information on floating trajectories, raft persistence, 
and performance of associated organisms will help to estimate the potential of marine litter for the transport of invasive species or entire rafting communities, and therefore add to our understanding of the hazardous character of marine litter beyond the immediate effects of ingestion and entanglement.159

Microplastics in the Marine Environment: 
Sources, Consequences and Solutions

M. Bergmann et al. (eds.), Marine Anthropogenic Litter,  DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-16510-3_7Abstract Microplastics are small fragments of plastic debris that have accumu-
lated in the environment on a global scale. They originate from the direct release 
of particles of plastic and as a consequence of the fragmentation of larger items. Microplastics are widespread in marine habitats from the poles to the equator; from the sea surface and shoreline to the deep sea. They are ingested by a range of organisms including commercially important fish and shellfish and in some popu-lations the incidence of ingestion is extensive. Laboratory studies indicate that ingestion could cause harmful toxicological and/or physical effects. However, our understanding of the relative importance of these effects in natural populations is very limited. Looking to the future it seems inevitable that the quantity of micro-plastic will increase in the environment, since even if we could stop new items of debris entering the ocean, fragmentation of the items already present would  
continue for years to come. The term microplastics has only been in popular usage for a decade and while many questions remain about the extent to which they could have harmful effects, the solutions to reducing this contamination are at hand. There are considerable synergies to be achieved by designing plastic items for both their lifetime in service and their efficient end-of-life recyclability, since capturing waste via recycling will reduce usage of non-renewable oil and gas used in the production of new plastics and at the same time reduce the accumulation of waste in managed facilities such as land fill as well as in the natural environment.

7.1  Introduction
Microplastics is used as a collective term to describe a truly heterogeneous mixture 
of particles ranging in size form a few microns to several millimetres in diameter; including particles of various shapes from completely spherical to elongated fibres. Microplastics have been reported in a range of colors. However, pieces that differ in appearance according to their shape size or color to ambient natural particulates are most commonly reported, for example blue or red fibres (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 
2012). The term microplastics has been widely used in relation to anthropogenic debris since 2004 when Thompson et al. used the term to illustrate and describe the accumulation of truly microscopic pieces of plastic in marine sediments and in the water column in European waters (Fig. 7.1). Microplastic contamination has since been reported on a global scale from the poles to the equator (Barnes et al. 2009; Browne et al. 2011; Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012) and contaminates the water surface of the open ocean (Law et al. 2010; Collignon et al. 2012; Goldstein et al. 2012; Ivar do Sul et al. 2013), estuaries (Sadri and Thompson 2014) and lakes (Eriksen et al. 2013) together with marine (Browne et al. 2011; Santos et al. 2009) and freshwater shorelines (Imhof et al. 2013) and subtidal sediments (Browne et al. 2011) down to the deep sea (Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013; Woodall et al. 2014). Microplastics have also been reported in considerable concentrations in Arctic sea ice (Obbard et al. 2014; Fig. 7.2). Over the past decade, interest in the topic has grown immensely and there are now well over 100 publications on microplastic (Fig. 7.3) and numerous reviews (Browne et al. 2007; Arthur et al. 2009; Andrady 
2011; Cole et al. 2011; Zarfl et al. 2011; Wright et al. 2013b; Ivar do Sul and Costa 
2014; Law and Thompson 2014) spanning sources, occurrence, abundance, inges-
tion by biota and consequences. Alongside this scientific research there has been growing interest from the media, the public and policy makers. The first policy centered workshop on the topic was hosted by NOAA in the USA during 2008 (Arthur et al. 2009). Specific reference to microplastics was later made within EU legislation via the Marine Strategy Framework Directive in 2010 (Galgani et al. 2010), and more recently there has been legislation and voluntary actions by indus-try to reduce the use of microplastics in cosmetics. However, even in the unlikely event that inputs of larger items of debris were to cease immediately, it is likely that the quantities of microplastics would continue to increase in the environment due to the fragmentation of legacy items of larger debris. Hence, it is essential to gain further understanding about the sources, consequences and fate of microplas-tics in the ocean.
Microplastics originate from a variety of sources, but these can be broadly cat-
egorized as primary: the direct release of small particles, for example, as a result of release of pellets or powders, or secondary, which results from fragmenta-tion of larger items (Andrady 2011; Cole et al. 2011; Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012). 
Microplastic-sized particles are directly used in a wide range of applications. Plastic pellets (around 5 mm diameter) and powders (less than 0.5 mm) are used as a feedstock for the production of larger items and the presence of these pellets (also 187

known as nurdles or mermaids tears) has been widely reported as a consequence 
of industrial spillage (Hays and Cormons 1974; Bourne and Imber 1982; Harper and Fowler 1987; Shiber 1987; Blight and Burger 1997). Small plastic particles 
typically around 0.25 mm are also widely used as abrasive in cosmetic products (Fig. 7.4) and as an industrial shot-blasting abrasive. Microplastics from cosmet-
ics and cleaning agents (also known as microbeads) will be carried with waste water via sewers and are unlikely to be effectively removed by sewage treatment, and hence are accumulating in the environment (Zitko and Hanlon 1991; Gregory

1996 ). It is estimated that in the US alone around 100  tons of microplastics might 
enter the oceans annually (Gouin et  al. 2011 ). In addition to the direct release of 
primary microplastics, larger items of plastic debris will progressively become brit -
tle under the action of ultraviolet light and heat and then fragment with physical 
action from wind and waves (Andrady 2015 ). Hence large items of debris are likely 
to represent a considerable source of microplastics (Andrady 2003 , 2011 ). In addi -
tion to fragmentation in the environment, some items also fragment in use resulting 
in particles of microplastic being released to the environment as a consequence of 
everyday usage or cleaning. This has been demonstrated for the release of fibres 
from garments as a consequence of washing (Browne et  al. 2011 ). It is now evident 
that, as a collective consequence of these diverse inputs, microplastics are wide -
spread in natural habitats and in the organisms living there, including benthic inver -
tebrates, commercially important lobsters, numerous species of fish, sea birds and 
marine mammals (Murray and Cowie 2011 ; Possatto et  al. 2011 ; van Franeker et  al. 
2011 ; Foekema et  al. 2013 ; Lusher et  al. 2013 ; Rebolledo et  al. 2013 ).
Our understanding about microplastics has advanced considerably over the last 
decade, but is still in its infancy and our knowledge of the relative importance of var -
ious sources, spatial trends in distribution and abundance, temporal trends, or effects 
on biota are still quite limited (Law and Thompson 2014 ). Initial work describing 
microplastics indicated a small increase in the abundance of this debris over time 
and that in laboratory conditions a range of invertebrates would ingest the mate -
rial (Thompson et  al. 2004 ). Subsequent work has described the range of habitats 
(Law et  al. 2010 ; Browne et  al. 2011 ; Van Cauwenberghe et  al. 2013 ) and organ -
isms (Graham and Thompson 2009 ; Murray and Cowie 2011 ; van Franeker et  al.

Bakir and R.C. Thompson, Plymouth University)190 R.C. Thompson
2011; Lusher et al. 2013) that are contaminated by microplastic in the environment. 
These early studies have been pioneering in nature providing proof of concept, but are difficult to use as a base line because of the inevitable lack of consistency in methods. In parallel, there have been laboratory studies which have exposed organ-isms to microplastics in order to determine the potential for this debris to result in harm to the creatures that encounter it in the natural environment (Browne et al. 2008, 2013; Rochman et al. 2013; Wright et al. 2013a). The main route of concern 
is currently as a consequence of ingestion, which could lead to physical (Wright 2014) and toxicological effects on biota (Teuten et al. 2007; Browne et al. 2008). Plastics are known to sorb persistent organic pollutants (Mato et al. 2001; Ogata 
et al. 2009; Teuten et al. 2009) and metals (Holmes et al. 2012) from seawater and organic pollutants can become orders of magnitude more concentrated on the sur -
face of the plastic than in the surrounding water (Mato et al. 2001; Ogata et al. 2009; 
Teuten et al. 2009). There is evidence from laboratory studies that these chemicals can be transferred from plastics to organisms upon ingestion (Teuten et al. 2009) 
and that this can result in harm (Browne et al. 2013; Rochman et al. 2013; Wright et al. 2013a). The potential for transfer varies according to the specific combination 
of plastic and contaminant with some polymers such as polyethylene having con-siderable potential for transport (Bakir et al. 2012). Subsequent desorption will also vary according to physiological conditions upon ingestion with the presence of gut surfactants and increased temperature leading to increased desorption (Teuten et al. 2007; Bakir et al. 2012). However, modeling studies suggest that when compared 
to the transport of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) by other pathways such as respiration and food that plastics are not likely to be a major vector in the transport of POPs from seawater to organisms (Gouin et al. 2011; Koelmans et al. 2013). A 
second toxicological issue is that some plastics contain chemical additives that are potentially harmful (Rochman 2015). These additives can be present in concentra-tions much greater than is likely to result from sorption of POPs and there is con-cern that additives might be released to organisms upon ingestion (Oehlmann et al. 2009; Thompson et al. 2009; Rochman and Browne 2013). There is evidence that such chemicals can be present, for example as leachates from landfill sites, in aquatic habitats at concentrations that are sufficient to cause harm (Oehlmann et al. 2009). There is also evidence that chemical additives can transfer from plastics to sea birds (Tanaka et al. 2013). However, it is not clear whether ingestion of plastics 
themselves could result in sufficient transfer of additive chemicals to cause harm. This would require experiments with plastics for which the composition of chemical constituents is known.
7.2  Definitions of Microplastics
When reported in 2004 the term microplastics was used to describe fragments of plastic around 20 µm in diameter. These were reported in intertidal and shal-low subtidal sediments and in surface waters in northwestern Europe (Thompson 191
7 Microplastics in the Marine Environment …
et al. 2004; Fig. 7.1). Subsequent research showed that similar sized particles  
were present in shallow waters around Singapore (Ng and Obbard 2006). 
However, while these early reports referred to truly microscopic particles they did not give a specific definition of microplastic. In 2008, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) of the US hosted the first International Microplastics Workshop in Washington and as part of this meeting formulated a broader working definition to include all particles less than 5 mm in diameter (Arthur et al. 2009). Particles of this size (i.e. <5 mm) have been very widely reported including publications that considerably pre-dated the use of the term “microplastics” (Carpenter et al. 1972; Colton et al. 1974). There is still some debate over the most appropriate upper size bound to use in a for -
mal definition of microplastics, with perhaps a more intuitive boundary follow-ing the SI classification of <1 mm. The European Union have followed the US and adopted a 5-mm upper bound for categorization of microplastics within the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD, Galgani et al. 2010). There is a similar lack of clarity when considering the lower size bound for a definition of microplastics. Operationally, this, by default, has been assumed to be the mesh size of the particular net or sieve used to separate the microplastic from the bulk medium of sediment or water column (see review by Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012). However, as a necessity of construction, collection devices with meshes in the sub-millimetre size range have a high ratio of net/sieve material compared to apertures and as a consequence they will trap particles much smaller than the size of the apertures/mesh size. Hence, it is not sensible to define the minimum size captured on the basis of the mesh used to collect the sample. Within the EU MSFD a pragmatic approach has been taken based on that used by research-ers sampling benthic infauna and sediments with sieves (e.g. Wentworth gradu-ated sieves), where the organisms ‘retained’ by a particular sieve are reported. In summary, there is no universally agreed definition of microplastic size, but most workers consider microplastic to be particles of plastic <5 mm in size. There is little consensus on the lower size bound.
While defining parameters is essential for consistent monitoring, in the wider 
context of marine debris and concerns about the potential harmful effects of microplastic it may actually be unwise to specify the size definitions precisely at the present time. Differently sized particles are likely to have differing effects. For example, smaller particles could have consequences that are fundamentally differ -
ent to larger particles, since the particles themselves can accumulate in tissues and/or may cause disruption of physiological processes (Browne et al. 2008; Wright et al. 2013c). From a monitoring science, rather than a curiosity-driven perspec-tive, a logical rationale for sampling is to consider abundance in relation to any associated impacts. Since our understanding of the potential impacts of micro-plastics is currently in its infancy it could, for the time being, be unwise to set a formal limit to lower size boundary and, until there is better understanding about which types/sizes of microplastics are of concern a sensible strategy could be to collect from the bulk medium any particles <5 mm and then quantify microplastics according to size categories.192 R.C. Thompson
7.3  Spatial and Temporal Patterns in the Abundance  
of Microplastics
Our understanding about the distribution and the factors affecting the distribu-
tion of microplastics in the oceans is limited and much of the sampling to date has been opportunistic utilizing existing research programs (research cruises, educa-tional programs, routine plankton monitoring) to collect material. There has also been some targeted microplastic sampling and attempts to make formal compar -
isons in the abundance of microplastics between locations (Browne et al. 2010, 2011). Existing data indicate that microplastics are widely distributed in surface waters, in shallow waters (Browne et al. 2011; Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012), in deep-sea sediments (Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013) and in the digestive tract of a range 
of organisms living within these habitats (Lusher 2015). With the exception of heavily contaminated areas such as shipbreaking yards (Reddy et al. 2006), the abundance of microplastics would appear to be relatively low in surface waters and sediments (see Lusher 2015). By volume it is apparent, however, that sedi-ments are more contaminated than surface waters.
However, because of their ubiquity, the total quantity of microplastics in the 
environment is considerable and in some locations represents the most numerous type of debris present (Browne et al. 2010). This ubiquity is also demonstrated by encounters when considered by marine species, of which around 10 % are with microplastics (Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity and Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel GEF 2012). In terms of spatial patterns in abun-dance, at a global scale Browne et al. (2011) detected a weak relationship between 
the abundance of microplastics and human population density. Extensive sampling by Law et al. (2010) demonstrated the role of large-scale physical factors lead-ing to increased abundance in the North Atlantic gyre far from the nearest land. She matched abundance data form the ocean surface with model predictions based on physical factors indicating that, at large scales, factors driving the abundance of debris can be used to make predictions about relative abundance (Law et al. 2010; Fig. 7.5). Formal comparisons also demonstrated patterns at smaller spatial scales with locations previously used for the dumping of sewage sludge having greater quantities of microplastic than control areas (Browne et al. 2011). In addi-tion, intertidal sediments on shores that were downwind in relation to prevailing wind direction can have greater quantities of microplastic than those on shore-lines that were up-wind (Browne et al. 2010). Targeted sampling has also indi-cated extremely high microplastic abundance near to a plastic processing plant in Sweden (Norén 2008). However, while the role of some potential sources includ-ing sewage and industrial spillage have been demonstrated together with the influ-ence of physical factors leading to accumulation of debris in particular locations, our collective understanding of the relative importance of these factors in influenc-ing spatial patterns of distribution or in making predictions about such is limited.
Only a handful of studies have considered temporal patterns in the abundance

et al. (2012) in the North Pacific both report on an increase in abundance over 
time. While examination of a very extensive data set by Law et al. (2010) revealed no clear temporal trend in abundance over two decades of sampling in the North Atlantic, Thompson et al. (2004) used samples collected by the con-tinuous plankton recorder to examine temporal changes in surface waters to the north of Scotland and showed a significant increase in the abundance of micro-plastics when comparing between the 1960s and 1970s with the 1980s and 1990s. Goldstein et al. (2012) compared abundance in heavily contaminated areas of the Pacific and also recorded and increase in abundance over time. However, sampling methodology differed between sampling dates making it difficult to clearly iden-tify the underlying trends in microplastic abundance (Goldstein et al. 2012). It is clear that the abundance of microplastic is likely to vary considerably in space and in time, but we have little understanding of the associated scales of variation, nei-ther do we have a clear understanding about the relative importance of, or interac-tions among, the various factors affecting distribution or about which, if any, types of microplastic might be hazardous. Such uncertainty considerably limits our abil-ity to implement monitoring programs necessary to assess changes in abundance over time and in relation to regulatory measures.
7.4  Anticipated Future Trends
Global production of plastic has increased from around 5 million tons per year during the 1950s to over 280 million tons today (Thompson et al. 2009; PlasticsEurope 2011). However, the majority of this is used to make single-use 
items, which are disposed of within a year of production (Thompson et al. 2009).

concentration, C (color shading), of initially homogeneous (C = 1) surface tracer after 10-year 
model integration. Averages and standard errors were computed in one-degree latitude bins. The highest plastic concentrations were observed in subtropical latitudes (22–38°N) where model tracer concentration is also a maximum. Reproduced from Law et al. (2010) with permission194 R.C. Thompson
Hence, considerable quantities of end-of-life plastics are accumulating in land fills 
and in the natural environment. The quantity of end-of-life plastic in the marine environment is substantial but as yet there are few reliable estimates of the total amount, or the relative proportions of different types of debris such as microplas-tic. Recent studies have attempted to assess global distributions (Cózar et al. 2014; Eriksen et al. 2014), the logical next step could be to estimate total production, 
current tonnage in use and accumulated disposal via recognized waste manage-ment in order to establish via a mass balance the amount of plastic that is miss-ing and potentially in the environment (Jambeck et al. 2015). It is apparent that end-of-life plastic items are abundant and widely distributed in the oceans and that these items are progressively fragmenting into small pieces which are now abun-dant in the environment (Fig. 7.6). In some locations, it is evident that microplas-tics are numerically, as opposed to by mass, the most abundant type of solid debris present (Browne et al. 2010). However, despite the deterioration of plastic items into plastic fragments, conventional plastics will not readily biodegrade and it is considered that all of the plastics that have ever been produced are still present

on the planet (unless they have bene incinerated) (Thompson et al. 2005). Hence, 
even if we were to cease using plastic items, which is not something I would advo-
cate, the quantity of microplastic will continue to increase as a consequence of fragmentation of existing larger items (Thompson et al. 2009; STAP 2011).
From a personal perspective my interest in what we now describe as microplas-
tics started in the in the mid-1990s. I was well aware that over the previous dec-ades we had shifted to a very disposable society with considerable generation of waste. It was apparent that waste items including plastics were entering the oceans on a daily basis. These plastic items were resistant to degradation and I became curious as to where all the end-of-life single-use plastic items were accumulating in the natural environment. At that time, as is still largely the case, there was a distinct lack of data indicating any increasing temporal trends in the abundance of plastic debris and I considered that a substantial proportion may be accumulating 
as fragments, which were being missed by routine litter surveys (Fig. 7.6). These observations inspired the research leading to my paper in 2004 entitled ‘Lost at sea where is all the plastic?’. In this paper I suggested that one reason we were not seeing a temporal trend was because the smaller fragments that were form-ing from larger items were not being recorded in routine monitoring. Ten years on it seems likely that accumulation of microplastics represents an important sink where the fragments of larger items reside in a size range that has seldom been monitored. However, while widely distributed in the marine environment the den-sities of microplastic recorded in the habitats studied to date are relatively low and indicate that if microplastics are indeed the ultimate end-product of our dispos-able society then some of the major sinks of this material are yet to be discovered. Many consider the deep sea likely to be a major sink and there is growing evi-dence that substantial quantities of macroplastic are accumulating there (Galgani et al. 1996). An initial survey suggested abundance in the deep sea may be lower than in shallow water habitats (Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013), however using dif-ferent approaches to record fibres there is recent evidence that the deep sea could be a substantial sink for microplastics (Woodall et al. 2014). Clearly more inves-tigation is required to confirm the relative importance of the deep sea as a sink for microplastics, to understand their long-term fate in the deep sea and the extent of any subsequent deterioration or biodegradation over extended timescales (Zettler et al. 2013).
7.5  Conclusions
It is evident that microplastic pieces now contaminate marine habitats worldwide. This debris is ingested by a wide range of organisms and for some species a major proportion of the population contains plastic fragments. There are concerns about the physical and toxicological harm that ingesting this debris might cause and laboratory experiments have demonstrated harmful effects. However, the relative importance of plastics as a vector for chemical transport or their importance as 196 R.C. Thompson
an agent causing physical harm to organisms in the natural environment are much 
less clear (Koelmans 2015).
Our understanding of potential future trends in the abundance of microplastic 
debris is limited. While it seems inevitable that the quantities of microplastic will increase in the environment as a consequence of further direct introductions of primary microplastic and fragmentation of larger items the likely trajectories and potential sinks or hot spots of accumulation are not clear. In conclusion, 10 years after the term microplastic widely entered the published literature and after a con-siderable body of research, there remain more questions than answers about the accumulation and consequences of microplastic contamination in the environment (Law and Thompson 2014). Ultimately, however, there is broad recognition that 
plastic debris does not belong in the ocean. It is also clear that the numerous soci-etal benefits that are derived from every-day-use of plastics can be achieved with-out the need for emissions of plastic waste to the environment. Since 8 % of the global oil production is currently used to make plastic items it seems clear that we urgently need to change the way we produce, use and dispose of plastic items. There is also a growing realization that the solution to two major environmental problems, our non-sustainable use of fossil carbon and accumulation of debris lie in utilizing end-of-life plastics as a raw material for new production. Such prin-ciples are central to the philosophy of developing a more circular economy and some believe that rethinking our use of plastic materials in line with this phi-losophy has considerable potential to bring much greater resource efficiency (European Commission 2012).

M. Bergmann et al. (eds.), Marine Anthropogenic Litter,  DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-16510-3_8Abstract Microplastics in aquatic ecosystems and especially in the marine environ-
ment represent a pollution of increasing scientific and societal concern, thus, recently 
a substantial number of studies on microplastics were published. Although first steps towards a standardization of methodologies used for the detection and identification of microplastics in environmental samples are made, the comparability of data on microplastics is currently hampered by a huge variety of different methodologies, which result in the generation of data of extremely different quality and resolution. This chapter reviews the methodology presently used for assessing the concentra-tion of microplastics in the marine environment with a focus on the most convenient techniques and approaches. After an overview of non-selective sampling approaches, sample processing and treatment in the laboratory, the reader is introduced to the currently applied techniques for the identification and quantification of microplas-tics. The subsequent case study on microplastics in sediment samples from the North Sea measured with focal plane array (FPA)-based micro-Fourier transform infrared (micro-FTIR) spectroscopy shows that only 1.4 % of the particles visually resem-bling microplastics were of synthetic polymer origin. This finding emphasizes the importance of verifying the synthetic polymer origin of potential microplastics. Thus, a burning issue concerning current microplastic research is the generation of standards that allow for the assessment of reliable data on concentrations of micro-scopic plastic particles and the involved polymers with analytical laboratory tech-niques such as micro-FTIR or micro-Raman spectroscopy.

8.1  Introduction
Since the middle of the 20th century, the increasing global production of plas-
tics is accompanied by an accumulation of plastic litter in the marine environ-ment (Barnes et al. 2009; Thompson et al. 2004). Being dispersed by currents and winds, persistent plastics, whether deliberately dumped or accidentally lost, are rarely degraded but become fragmented over time (Thompson 2015). Together with micro-sized primary plastic litter from consumer products, these degraded secondary micro-fragments lead to an increasing amount of small plastic particles, so called “microplastics” (i.e. particles <5 mm) in the oceans (Andrady 2011). Microplastics are further divided according to their size into “large microplastics” (1–5 mm) and “small microplastics” (20 µm–1 mm) (Hanke et al. 2013).
The distribution of microplastics in the marine environment is strongly depend-
ent on their density. The density of a virgin-polymer particle is often altered dur -
ing the manufacturing process (e.g. density increase due to addition of inorganic fillers, density decrease due to foaming of the polymer) as well as through age-ing or biofouling processes (Harrison et al. 2011; Morét-Ferguson et al. 2010; Gregory 1983). Since most synthetic polymers have a lower density than seawater, 
microplastic particles mostly float at the sea surface (0.022–8,654 items m
−3) but 
occur to a lower extent suspended in the water column (0.014–12.51 items m−3). 
Sediments seem to represent a sink for microplastics (18,000–125,000 items m−3 
in subtidal sediments) while beaches, as intermediate environments, can accumu-late floating, neutrally buoyant as well as sinking plastics (185–80,000 items m
−3) 
(Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012).
The massive accumulation of microplastics in the oceans has been recognized 
by scientists and authorities worldwide, and previous studies have demonstrated the ubiquitous presence of microplastics in the marine environment (Browne et al. 2010; Hidalgo-Ruz and Thiel 2013; Ng and Obbard 2006; Claessens et al. 2011; Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013; Vianello et al. 2013). Thus, with the Marine 
Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD-indicator 10.1.3) the EU prescribes a mandatory monitoring of microplastics (Zarfl et al. 2011), and the EU Technical Subgroup on Marine Litter (TSG-ML) proposed a standardized monitoring strat-egy for microplastics in the EU (Hanke et al. 2013).
Researchers worldwide report on the uptake of microplastics by various marine 
organisms (Cole et al. 2013; Ugolini et al. 2013; Foekema et al. 2013; Murray and Cowie 2011; Browne et al. 2008). Ingestion of microplastics may lead to “…potentially fatal injuries such as blockages throughout the digestive system or abrasions from sharp objects…” (Wright et al. 2013), which, in contrast to macro-plastics, mainly affect microorganisms, smaller invertebrates or larvae. In addition to these physical effects on single organisms, the ecological implications can be even more severe as microplastics can release toxic additives upon degradation and accumulate persistent organic pollutants (POPs) (Bakir et al. 2012; Engler 2012; Rios et al. 2007; Teuten et al. 2009; Rochman et al. 2013). Because of their 
minute size, microplastics harbor the risk of entering marine food webs at low 203
8 Methodology Used for the Detection and Identification …
trophic levels and propagating toxic substances up the food web (Besseling et al. 
2013; Mato et al. 2001). However, this is discussed controversially in the litera-ture and several studies suggest that this issue is of minor importance from a risk assessment perspective (compare, e.g. Gouin et al. 2011; Koelmans et al. 2013, Koelmans 2015). Nevertheless, microplastics harbor the risk of transporting POPs 
to human food (Engler 2012). Because of their long residence time at sea plastics can travel long distances (Ebbesmeyer and Ingraham 1994) and thus function as 
vectors for dispersal of toxins and/or pathogenic microorganisms (Harrison et al. 2011; Zettler et al. 2013). However, although the potential risks associated with marine microplastics have recently been acknowledged the manifold impacts of microplastics on the ecosystems of the oceans have not been investigated in detail and are thus only poorly understood.
Current microplastic research suffers from insufficient reliable data on con-
centrations of microplastics in the marine environment and on the composition of involved polymers because standard operation protocols (SOP) for microplastic sampling and detection are not available (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012; Claessens et al. 2013; Imhof et al. 2012; Nuelle et al. 2014). Although first steps towards a stand-ardization have been made, e.g. in the European Union by TSG-ML (Hanke et al. 2013), the comparability of data on microplastics is still hampered by a huge vari-ety of different methods that lead to the generation of data of extremely different quality and resolution.
In this chapter, we will critically review the methodology presently used for 
assessing the concentration of microplastics in the marine environment. We will focus on the most convenient techniques and approaches recently applied for the identification of microplastics. After an overview of non-selective sampling approaches and sample processing in the laboratory, we will introduce the reader to currently applied detection techniques for microplastics. Finally, we present a case study to emphasize the importance of verifying the synthetic polymer origin of potential microplastics by e.g. micro-Fourier transform infrared (micro-FTIR) spectroscopy. In an outlook, we will address important gaps in knowledge con-cerning the detection of microplastics and how these could be potentially filled.
8.2  Sampling for Microplastics
Today, synthetic polymers are omnipresent and daily life without plastics is incon-ceivable. As a consequence, even microplastic sampling, preparation and analy-sis procedures themselves are affected by the ubiquity of synthetic polymers in the environment. Hence, a multitude of contamination sources from sampling equipment through clothes or airborne particles can compromise the analysis of microplastics in the environment. This can lead to a great overestimation of con-centrations of microplastics in samples. Because of their ability to hover in air, especially fibres have a high contamination potential and can cause problems during microplastic analysis (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012; Nuelle et al. 2014; Norén 204 M.G.J. Löder and G. Gerdts
2007; Norén and Naustvoll 2010). Thus, a special focus should be laid on the 
prevention of contamination (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012). Potential sources of con-tamination should be avoided by replacing plastic devices or laboratory ware by non-plastic material and the strict use of control samples is highly recommended. Analysis of control samples facilitates the identification of the source in case a contamination has occurred.
8.2.1  Water Samples
Because of their relatively low concentrations in the environment sampling of micro-plastic particles generally requires large sample volumes. Thus, samples from the open water are usually taken with plankton nets of different mesh sizes. The sea surface is sampled for floating microplastics by manta trawls (Eriksen et al. 2013a, b; Doyle 
et al. 2011) or neuston nets (Morét-Ferguson et al. 2010; Carpenter and Smith 1972; Colton et al. 1974). While neuston catamarans (Fig. 8.1a) can be operated even in higher waves, a manta trawl (Fig. 8.1b) is best used in calm waters to prevent hopping on waves and damage to the device. The volume filtered by a net is usually recorded by a flowmeter mounted at the net opening, enabling the normalization to the filtered water volume and thus a calculation of concentrations of microplastics (items/grams) per unit water volume. Relating concentrations to sampled area is also possible by mul-tiplying trawl distance by the horizontal width of the net opening. The water column can be sampled for suspended microplastics by trawling with different plankton nets, e.g. CalCOFI (California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations) or Bongo nets (Doyle et al. 2011). Trawling speed depends on weather conditions and currents, but usually lies between 1 and 5 knots. Trawling time depends on seston concentrations and lies between a few minutes up to several hours (Boerger et al. 2010). The plankton sample is concentrated in the cod-end of the net and after recovery the net has to be carefully rinsed from the exterior to assure that all plankton and debris are washed into the cod-end (Doyle et al. 2011). It is important to assure that no residual sample is left 
in the net, which would lead to a carryover of microplastics to the next sample. The content of the codend is finally transferred to a sample container and fixed with plastic friendly fixatives (e.g. formalin) or stored frozen. If the particles are directly sorted they should be dried and kept in the dark until further analysis (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012).
The size of the particles retained and also the filterable volume is a direct conse-
quence of the mesh size used. The mesh sizes used for sampling in previous studies varied between 50 and 3000 µm (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012). Another factor influenc-
ing the filtered volume is the net size, i.e. the area, which acts as filter. Depending on the seston concentration in the water, a few thousand litres to several hundred cubic metres can be filtered until a net becomes clogged. Seasons with red tides or plankton and jellyfish blooms are generally unfavorable for sampling large volumes of water. Nets are usually 3–4.5 m long and a mesh size of around 300 µm is most commonly used. These nets do not sample microplastic particles <300 µm quantita-tively but allow for sampling of larger volumes of water. In order to avoid the risk of 205
8 Methodology Used for the Detection and Identification …
clogging nets at small mesh sizes, only few studies used mesh sizes <300 µm. The 
non-standardized use of different nets and mesh sizes seriously impedes the compa-rability of data sets on pelagic microplastic concentrations.
Besides common net sampling, other techniques are occasionally used for assess-
ing microplastic concentrations in the water column: bulk sampling with subsequent filtration (Ng and Obbard 2006; Dubaish and Liebezeit 2013), screening Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) samples (Thompson et al. 2004) or using direct in situ fil-tration (Norén and Naustvoll 2010). A highly promising technique, currently under development, is the use of direct fractionated pressure filtering of large (>1 m
3) 
volumes of water through a filter cascade (developed by -4H-JENA engineering GmbH). This approach theoretically allows for the simultaneous sampling of differ -
ent size fractions of microplastics down to <10 µm and thus enables a more compre-hensive resolution of the size spectrum of microplastics.

8.2.2  Sediment Samples
Microplastics in sediments or beaches are currently more frequently analyzed than 
microplastics in the water column (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012). Sampling approaches depend on the sampling location i.e. sampling sediments directly on beaches or sampling subtidal sediments from a ship.
8.2.2.1  Beaches
Sampling beaches for microplastics is relatively easy and requires nothing more than 
a non-plastic sampling tool (tablespoon, trowel or small shovel), a frame or a corer to specify the sampling area and a container (if possible non-plastic) to store the sample. The quantity of samples reported in the literature varies between less than 500 g to up to 
10 kg (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012). While sampling on a beach poses no problem per se, the positioning of the sample location on the beach is still a matter of scientific debate as the distribution of microplastic particles is as dynamic as the beach itself (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012). The high-tide line where flotsam accumulates is sampled mostly (Browne 
et al. 2010). Commonly applied sampling strategies include random sampling at several locations on the beach, on transects perpendicular or parallel to the water or in single squares. Often, several samples are pooled for an integrated estimate of the microplastic contamination of a beach. Every single sampling location for the pooled sample is then defined as described above. Another point of concern is the sampling depth. Sampling the top five centimetres is a common approach (as also suggested by the TSG-ML), but sampling to a depth of 0.3 m is also reported in the literature (Claessens et al. 2011). If corers are used for sampling, different depth layers can be sampled so that microplastic concentrations can be related to sediment depth and eventually to the age of the cor -
responding sediment layer. The units of microplastic abundance reported depend on the sampling approach. Thus, abundance is normalized to sampling area, sediment weight or volume. Sampling sediments for microplastics at beaches might appear trivial. However, currently no standard protocol exists for sampling microplastics with respect to location, sampling technique and sample quantity, and thus the comparability of the data produced is limited. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for the development of standardized sampling approaches. Because of the patchy distribution of microplastics at beaches a standardized, spatially integrating sampling design appears reasonable and would facilitate the generation of comparable data. A first step towards the standardiza-tion of sampling microplastics at beaches in the EU has been made by the TSG-ML (Hanke et al. 2013). They recommend to monitor microplastics at sandy beaches at the strandline with a minimum of five replicate samples separated by at least five metres and to distinguish two size categories: large microplastics (1–5 mm) and small micro-plastics (20 µm–1 mm). Small microplastics should be sampled from the top five centi-
metres with a metal spoon by combining several scoops at arm length in an arc-shaped area at the strand line to collect ca. 250 g of sediment; large microplastics should be sampled from the top five centimetres and several kilograms of sediment sample can be reduced by sieving over a 1-mm sieve directly at the beach.207

8.2.2.2  Subtidal Sediments
Subtidal sediments can be sampled from vessels with grabs, e.g. Van Veen or 
Ekman grab or corers of different design, e.g. a multiple corer. Grabs tend to dis-turb the sediment and are suited for surface (e.g. top five centimetres) or bulk sampling, whereas undisturbed core samples enable the simultaneous sampling of surface and depth layers but yield smaller sample volumes. The size of the instru-ment applied as well as the time needed for its retrieval depends strongly on the water depth at the sampling location. The use of corers enables sampling to a water depth of more than 5,000 m (Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013). Sediment samples are usually stored frozen or dried and kept in the dark until further analysis.
8.2.3  Biota
The ingestion of microplastics by various marine vertebrates and invertebrates under laboratory conditions and in the field has been reported in the literature (Lusher 2015). As sampling strategies are variable and depend strongly on the 
organism targeted we give only a short overview of possible sample organisms for the ingestion of microplastics with a focus on field sampling. For a detailed review please refer to Wright et al. 2013 and Ivar do Sul and Costa 2013.
Laboratory studies on the ingestion of microplastics by marine biota frequently 
use microscopic plastic beads of known polymer origin, which can be easily rec-ognized and counted under the microscope in gut contents and excretions or—in the case of transparent planktonic organisms—in the organism itself (Cole et al. 2013). In this context, the use of fluorescent particles facilitates the recovery and enumeration of the particles.
Investigations on the ingestion of microplastics by vertebrates in the field 
require a substantially higher effort and thus studies in this area of research are rare (Wright et al. 2013). The target for sampling is the content of the digestive tract or the excretions of an organism. Larger organisms that are directly sampled for microplastics are mainly fish, which are usually sampled by nets or traps.
Stranded carcasses (e.g. birds, seals, cetaceans) can be collected and exam-
ined for ingested microplastics. This has been done for stranded northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) in the North Sea for more than three decades (Wright et al. 2013; Kühn et al. 2015). After dissection, the gut content or the entire digestive tract has to be conserved or frozen for later analysis. Another possibility used for the sampling of mammals and birds is to “indirectly” sample organisms for the ingestion of microplastics by collecting their boluses, casts or faeces. Bond and Lavers (2013) used emetics to monitor plastic ingestion in storm-petrel chicks (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) enabling the authors to study plastic ingestion non-lethally. Smaller invertebrate organisms such as worms, mussels and snails can be directly collected in the field (Besseling et al. 2013; Claessens et al. 2013) with 208 M.G.J. Löder and G. Gerdts
nets or traps and are best frozen as a whole until analyzed. Biological samples can 
be conserved by using plastic-friendly fixatives (e.g. formalin) or best be frozen or dried and kept dark until analysis.
8.3  Laboratory Preparation of Samples
8.3.1  Extraction of Microplastics
The densities of common consumer-plastic polymers range between 0.8 (silicone) and 1.4 g cm
−3 (e.g. polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) 
while expanded plastic foams have only a fraction of the densities of the origi-nal polymer (e.g. expanded polystyrene (EPS) <0.05 g cm
−3). Microplastic parti-
cles can thus be separated from matrices with higher densities, such as sediments (2.65 g cm
−3), by flotation with saturated salt solutions of high density. The dried 
sediment sample is mixed with the concentrated salt solution and agitated (e.g. by stirring, shaking, aeration) for a certain amount of time. Plastic particles float to the surface or stay in suspension while heavy particles such as sand grains set-tle quickly. Subsequently, microplastics are recovered by removing the superna-tant. Depending on the solution used, different fractions of the range of consumer polymers are targeted—the higher the density of the solution the more polymer types can be extracted. Often a saturated NaCl solution is used for the extrac-tion of microplastics (Thompson et al. 2004; Browne et al. 2010; Ng and Obbard 2006; Claessens et al. 2011; Browne et al. 2011). Although being an inexpensive 
and environment-friendly approach, not all common polymers are extracted (e.g. PVC, PET, polycarbonate (PC), polyurethane (PUR)) because of the relatively low density of the solution (~1.2 g cm
−3). Other solutions used include sodium poly-
tungstate solution (1.4 g cm−3) (Corcoran et al. 2009), zinc chloride solution (1.5–
1.7 g cm−3) (Imhof et al. 2012; Liebezeit and Dubaish 2012) or sodium iodine 
solution (1.8 g cm−3) (Nuelle et al. 2014). These high-density solutions are suit-
able for the extraction of most of the common user plastics. For financial/environ-mental reasons the use of zinc chloride and the recycling of the saturated solution by pressure filtration is highly recommended.
There is great variability in the extraction techniques applied. The approaches 
range from simply stirring the sediment sample in a saturated salt solution (classical setup) (Thompson et al. 2004; Claessens et al. 2011) to the use of an elutriation/fluidisation with subsequent flotation (Claessens et al. 2013; Nuelle 
et al. 2014) or the extraction with a novel instrument, the “Microplastic Sediment Separator” (MPSS) (Imhof et al. 2012). The extraction efficiencies vary between the techniques used but also depend on the particle shape, size and the poly-mer origin of the model particles used during recovery experiments. The classic extraction setup reaches recoveries of 80–100 % (Fries et al. 2013) but recov-ers small microplastics insufficiently (mean recovery rate 40 %, mean parti-cle size 40–309 µm) (Imhof et al. 2012), whereas new approaches achieve high 209
8 Methodology Used for the Detection and Identification …
recovery rates of 68–99 % (Nuelle et al. 2014), 96–100 % (Imhof et al. 2012) and 
98–100 % (Claessens et al. 2013). Small particles (<500 µm) are more difficult to extract from sediments. Therefore, time-consuming repeated extraction steps are recommended to maximize recovery (Claessens et al. 2013; Nuelle et al. 2014; Browne et al. 2011). Only the MPSS showed a recovery rate of 96 % for small microplastics in a single extraction step (Imhof et al. 2012).
8.3.2  Size Fractionation
Irrespective of the technique used for later identification of microplastics the frac-tionation of samples (water, sediment, biota) into (at least) two size classes, e.g. >500 µm and <500 µm, is reasonable (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012). For EU monitor -
ing purposes, a separation into fractions of 1–5 mm and 20 µm–1 mm was recently suggested (Hanke et al. 2013). Water samples can be fractionated easily by sieving. If large amounts of biological matrix (e.g. gut contents, tissue, large plankton) clog the sieve a purification step prior to sieving can be helpful. Microplastics from sedi-ment samples are easily size-fractionated after extraction. If the sediment sample matrix consists mainly of smaller grains (<500 µm) it can be sieved after drying (or wet) to reduce the volume for later extraction. In this case, the sample must be handled with care during sieving to avoid the mechanical generation of additional microplastic particles from larger, brittle plastic material. A 500 µm sieve, ideally made of steel, can be used for size separation. The use of a sieve cascade of differ -
ent mesh sizes allows for size separation and quantification of different size classes of microplastics (Moore et al. 2002; McDermid and McMullen 2004).
Microplastic particles >500 µm can be sorted out manually under a ster -
eomicroscope using forceps and subsequently analyzed (visually, spectroscopi-cally, other techniques). The effort involved in the manual sorting of particles increases for the fraction <500 µm owing to difficulties in handling small parti-
cles. Furthermore, an increasing amount of background matrix particles of differ -
ent organic or inorganic origin may impede a proper separation. Therefore, this fraction should be purified and concentrated on filters for further analysis by, e.g. spectroscopy. The suggested size separation (>500 µm; <500 µm) is accounted for by the techniques that can be used for later identification. Additionally, the stand-ardized application of size fractionation enables an inter-comparison between dif-ferent studies, at least for the larger fraction, even if the smaller fraction is not of interest for the study (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012).
8.3.3  Sample Purification
The purification of microplastic samples is obligatory, especially, for instrumen-tal analyses (FTIR/Raman spectroscopy, pyrolysis-GC/MS). Biofilms and other 210 M.G.J. Löder and G. Gerdts
organic and inorganic adherents have to be removed from the microplastic parti-
cles to avoid artifacts that impede a proper identification. Furthermore, the puri-fication step is necessary to minimize the non-plastic filter residue on filters on which the microplastic fraction <500 µm is concentrated. The most gentle way to clean plastic samples is stirring and rinsing with freshwater (McDermid and McMullen 2004). The use of ultrasonic cleaning (Cooper and Corcoran 2010) 
should be carefully considered because aged and brittle plastic material might break during treatment resulting in the artificial generation of secondary micro-plastics (Löder and Gerdts, personal observation). A treatment with 30 % hydro-gen peroxide of the dried sediment sample (Liebezeit and Dubaish 2012), the sample filter (Imhof et al. 2012; Nuelle et al. 2014) or the microplastic particles themselves removes large amounts of natural organic debris. Andrady (2011) suggests the use of mineral acids to disintegrate organic impurities in samples. For the digestion of the soft tissue of biotic samples Claessens et al. (2013) used either acid, base and oxidizer (hydrogen peroxide) or a specific mixture thereof. Hot acid digestion with HNO3 resulted in the best purification results (Claessens et al. 2013). However, several plastic polymers (e.g. polyamide, polyoxymethyl-ene, polycarbonate) react to strong acidic or alkaline solutions (Claessens et al. 2013; Liebezeit and Dubaish 2012), which limits the applicability of these rea-gents. More promising is the use of a sequential enzymatic digestion as a plastic-friendly purification step. A first attempt of enzymatic purification of samples has been made by Cole et al. (2014) who used only a single enzymatic step (protein-ase-K). Sample purification with different technical enzymes (lipase, amylase, proteinase, chitinase, cellulase) prior to micro-FTIR spectroscopy has success-fully been applied by our group. This approach reduces the biological matrix of plankton and sediment samples (including chitin, which is present especially in marine samples) as well as the matrix of biological tissue samples to a minimum and thus proved to be a very valuable technique to minimize matrix artifacts dur -
ing FTIR measurements (Löder and Gerdts, unpublished data).
8.4  Identification of Microplastics
8.4.1  Visual Identification
According to Hidalgo-Ruz et al. (2012) visual sorting to separate potential microplastics from other organic or inorganic material in the sample residues is an obligatory step for the identification of microplastics. If large microplastics are the target of a study this can be done by visual inspection (Morét-Ferguson et al. 2010) whereas smaller microplastic particles should generally be sorted out under a dissection microscope (Doyle et al. 2011). Sorting of aqueous samples can be facilitated by the use of sorting chambers (e.g. Bogorov counting cham-ber). Generally, if no more accurate methods (e.g. FTIR or Raman spectroscopy) are used to verify synthetic polymer origin of potential microplastic particles the 211
8 Methodology Used for the Detection and Identification …
visual identification should not be applied to particles <500 µm as the probability 
of a misidentification is very high. Hidalgo-Ruz et al. (2012) thus suggest an even 
higher size limit of 1 mm for visual identification. According to Norén (2007), selection of particles according to standardized criteria in connection with a strict and conservative examination reduces the possibility of misidentification. He sug-gests the following criteria: (1) no structures of organic origin should be visible in the plastic particle or fibre, (2) fibres should be equally thick and have a three-dimensional bending to exclude a biological origin, (3) particles should be clear and homogeneously colored, (4) transparent or whitish particles must be examined under high magnification and with the help of fluorescence microscopy to exclude a biological origin (Norén 2007). General aspects that are used to describe visually sorted microplastics are source, type, shape, degradation stage, and color of the particles (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012).
It is strongly recommended to subsequently analyze sorted particles by tech-
niques that facilitate a proper identification of plastics (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012; Dekiff et al. 2014) because the quality of the data produced by visual sorting depends strongly on (1) the counting person, (2) the quality and magnification of the microscope and (3) the sample matrix (e.g. plankton, sediment, gut content). Another fundamental drawback of visual sorting is the size limitation, i.e. particles below a certain size cannot be discriminated visually from other material or be sorted because they are unmanageable because of their minuteness. Furthermore, visual sorting is extremely time-consuming. In summary, even an experienced per -
son cannot discriminate all potential microplastic particles unambiguously from sand grains, chitin fragments, diatom frustule fragments, etc. Thus the error rate of visual sorting reported in the literature ranges from 20 % (Eriksen et al. 2013a) to 70 % (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012) and increases with decreasing particle size.
8.4.2  Identification of Microplastics by Their Chemical 
Composition
The repetitive fingerprint-like molecular composition of plastic polymers allows for 
a clear assignment of a sample to a certain polymer origin. In the following we will give a short overview of methods applied for polymer identification with a focus on the nowadays frequently used FTIR and Raman analyses of microplastics.
8.4.2.1  Density Separation with Subsequent C:H:N Analysis
Morét-Ferguson et al. (2010) used the specific densities of particles to identify the 
polymer origin of visually sorted microplastics. For this purpose, the sample was placed in distilled water and, depending on the density of the sample, either etha-nol or concentrated solutions of calcium or strontium chloride were added until the sample was neutrally buoyant. The density of the particle was indirectly assessed 212 M.G.J. Löder and G. Gerdts
by weighing a certain volume of the solution. This facilitated the determination 
of the density with high precision. Different groups of polymers possess a char -
acteristic elemental composition, which was used to identify the plastic origin of a particle by a subsequent C:H:N analysis. By comparison with the densities and C:H:N ratios of virgin-polymer samples the particle could be assessed as either plastic or not and assigned to a group of potential polymers (Morét-Ferguson et al. 2010). This approach represents an approximation to the identification of micro-plastic particles by narrowing the search for the potential polymer type but not a rigorous chemical analysis. Further drawbacks are the relatively high time effort, which hampers a high sample throughput and that this technique is not applicable to smaller particles.
8.4.2.2  Pyrolysis-GC/MS
Pyrolysis-gaschromatography (GC) in combination with mass spectrometry (MS) 
can be used to assess the chemical composition of potential microplastic particles by analyzing their thermal degradation products (Fries et al. 2013). The pyrolysis of plastic polymers results in characteristic pyrograms, which facilitate an identi-fication of the polymer type. This analytical approach is already used after extrac-tion and visual sorting of microplastics from sediments. The polymer origin of particles is then identified by comparing their characteristic combustion products with reference pyrograms of known virgin-polymer samples (Nuelle et al. 2014; Fries et al. 2013). If a thermal desorption step precedes the final pyrolysis organic plastic additives can be analyzed simultaneously during pyrolysis-GC/MS runs (Fries et al. 2013). Although the pyrolysis-GC/MS approach allows for a relatively good assignment of potential microplastics to polymer type it has the disadvantage that particles have to be manually placed into the pyrolysis tube. Since only parti-cles of a certain minimum size can be manipulated manually this results in a lower size limitation of particles that can be analyzed. Furthermore, the technique allows only for the analysis of one particle per run and is thus not suitable for processing large sample quantities, which are collected during sampling campaigns or routine monitoring programs. However, currently promising pyrolysis-GC/MS approaches for the qualitative/quantitative analysis of microplastics on whole environmen-tal sample filters are being developed (Scholz-Böttcher, personal communication).
8.4.2.3  Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy is a straightforward technique that has been successfully used 
to identify microplastic particles in different environmental samples with high reli-ability (Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013; Cole et al. 2013; Murray and Cowie 2011; 
Imhof et al. 2012, 2013). During the analysis with Raman spectroscopy the sam-
ple is irradiated with a monochromatic laser source. The laser depends on the sys-tem used: available laser wavelengths usually range between 500 and 800 nm. The 213
8 Methodology Used for the Detection and Identification …
interaction of the laser light with the molecules and atoms of the sample (vibra-
tional, rotational, and other low-frequency interactions) results in differences in the frequency of the backscattered light when compared to the irradiating laser frequency. This so-called Raman shift can be detected and leads to substance-spe-cific Raman spectra. Since plastic polymers possess characteristic Raman spectra the technique can be applied to identify plastic polymers within minutes by com-parison with reference spectra. Raman spectroscopy is a “surface technique”, thus large, visually sorted microplastic particles can be analyzed and the technique can also be coupled with microscopy. Accordingly, micro-Raman spectroscopy allows for the identification of a broad range of size classes down to very small plastic particles of sizes below 1 µm (Cole et al. 2013). If Raman microscopy is combined with Raman spectral imaging it is possible to generate spatial chemical images based on the Raman spectra of a sample. Micro-Raman imaging theoretically allows for the spectral analysis of whole membrane filters at a spatial resolution below 1 µm. This would facilitate the detection of even the smallest microplastic particles in environmental samples, but the applicability for microplastic research has yet to be demonstrated. Raman spectroscopy can also be coupled with confo-cal laser-scanning microscopy to locate polymer particles within biological tissues with subcellular precision (Cole et al. 2013). One drawback of Raman spectros-
copy is that fluorescent samples excited by the laser (e.g. residues of biological origin from samples) cannot be measured as they prevent the generation of inter -
pretable Raman spectra. Generally, lower laser wave lengths, which transfer a high energy result in high signal intensity but also in a high fluorescence. The fluores-cence can be minimized by using lasers with higher wave lengths (>1,000 nm). However, the lower energy of the laser results in a lower signal of the polymer sample. More research is necessary to find the optimum laser wave length for a compromise between suppressed fluorescence and low signal intensity for assess-ments of microplastics in environmental samples. Generally, a purification step of samples to prevent fluorescence is thus recommended prior to measurements for a clear identification of the polymer type of microplastic particles with Raman spectroscopy.
8.4.2.4  IR Spectroscopy
Similar to Raman spectroscopy, infrared (IR) or Fourier-transform infrared 
(FTIR) spectroscopy offers the possibility of accurate identification of plastic polymer particles according to their characteristic IR spectra (Thompson et al. 2004; Ng and Obbard 2006; Vianello et al. 2013; Harrison et al. 2012; Frias 
et al. 2010; Reddy et al. 2006). FTIR and Raman spectroscopy are complemen-
tary techniques. Molecular vibrations, which are Raman inactive are IR active and vice versa and can thus provide complementary information on microplas-tic samples. IR spectroscopy takes advantage of the fact that infrared radiation excites molecular vibrations when interacting with a sample. The excitable vibrations depend on the composition and molecular structure of a substance 214 M.G.J. Löder and G. Gerdts
and are wave-length specific. The energy of the IR radiation that excites a spe-
cific vibration will—depending on the wave length—be absorbed to a certain amount, which enables the measurement of characteristic IR spectra. Plastic polymers possess highly specific IR spectra with distinct band patterns mak-ing IR spectroscopy an optimal technique for the identification of microplastics (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012). FTIR spectroscopy can provide further information on physico-chemical weathering of sampled plastic particles by detecting the intensity of oxidation (Corcoran et al. 2009).
As for Raman spectroscopy the comparison with reference spectra is nec-
essary for polymer identification. Large particles can be easily analyzed by an FTIR surface technique—“attenuated total reflectance” (ATR) FTIR spectros-copy—at high accuracy in less than one minute. A step forward with respect to the characterization of small-sized particles is the application of FTIR micros-copy. In this context, the use of two measuring modes is feasible: reflectance and transmittance. The reflectance mode bears the disadvantage that measure-ments of irregularly-shaped microplastics may result in non-interpretable spec-tra due to refractive error (Harrison et al. 2012). The transmittance mode needs IR transparent filters (e.g. aluminium oxide) and is, owing to total absorption patterns, limited by a certain thickness of the microplastics sample. However, the additional use of micro-ATR objectives in combination with microscopy can circumvent this as IR spectra are collected at the surface of a particle enabling the direct measurement on the sample filter without the need for manual han-dling of particles. Thus, an approach combining transmittance measurements with micro-ATR measurement of particles that show total absorption could be a promising solution for the measurement of particles <500 µm collected on fil-ters. Although micro-FTIR mapping, i.e. the sequential measurement of IR spec-tra at spatially separated, user-defined points on the sample surface, has been successfully applied for microplastics identification (Levin and Bhargava 2005) this technique is still extremely time-consuming when targeting the whole sam-ple filter surface at a high spatial resolution because it uses only a single detector element (Vianello et al. 2013; Harrison et al. 2012). Harrison et al. (2012) con-cluded that a highly promising FTIR extension, focal plane array (FPA)-based FTIR imaging (Levin and Bhargava 2005), allows for detailed and unbiased high throughput analysis of total microplastics on a sample filter. This technique ena-bles the simultaneous recording of several thousand spectra within an area with a single measurement and thus the generation of chemical images (see the below case study for a successful application of this technique by Löder and Gerdts). By combining FPA fields, whole sample filters can be analyzed via FTIR imag-ing. It should be noted, that the lateral resolution of micro-FTIR spectroscopy is diffraction limited (e.g. 10 µm at 1000 cm
−1) and, in contrast to Raman spec-
troscopy, samples must be dried prior to measurement via IR spectroscopy as water strongly absorbs IR radiation. Because of their high IR absorption the IR measurement of black particles is difficult. As for Raman measurements, sam-ples should be purified for proper identification of the polymer type of micro-plastic particles by IR spectroscopy.215

8.5  Case Study
The aim of the case study was to evaluate the applicability of FPA-based micro-
FTIR imaging for the measurement of microplastic particles in environmen-tal samples. We tested this technique on particles, which were purified and pre-extracted from sediment samples.
8.5.1  Materials and Methods
All steps preceding the micro-FTIR analysis (sampling, preparation, counting etc.) were done by the Lower Saxony Water Management, Coastal Defense and Nature Conservation Agency (NLWKN) or its contractors, which provided the samples.
8.5.1.1  Sediment Sampling
During a large-scale microplastics baseline assessment of the NLWKN, North 
Sea sediments were sampled at 101 stations along the German coast of Lower Saxony and on the East Frisian Islands between November 2011 and March 2012. Seventy-three stations were sampled on the islands of Baltrum, Juist, Kachelotplate, Mellum, Minsener Oog and Spiekeroog. On the islands, samples were taken in transects with five sub-samples at each station from the low-water line towards the vegetation zone of the first dune. Sixteen eulittoral samples were taken in the back-barrier tidal flat of Norderney and Spiekeroog and the tidal-flats “Hoher Weg” and “Wurster Watt”. Twelve sublittoral samples were taken on north-south transects at depths of 5, 10 and 20 m off the islands Baltrum, Juist and Spiekeroog and at one station in a tidal inlet in the back-barrier tidal flat of each island.
Beach and eulittoral samples were obtained at the onshore stations by sampling 
of five replicate areas of 10 × 10 cm within 1 m
2 down to a depth of 1 cm using 
a metal frame of the abovementioned dimensions. Sublittoral samples at the off-shore stations were obtained by a van Veen grab and the recovered material was also sampled on an area of 10 × 10 cm and down to 1 cm depth. Five grab sam-
ples were taken at each sublittoral station. No plastic equipment was used during sampling and all samples were stored in aluminium foil until further processing.
8.5.1.2  Extraction of Microplastics
After drying at 60 °C the samples were screened over a 500 µm metal sieve as sug-
gested by Hidalgo-Ruz et al. (2012) to obtain two size fractions of microplastics. 216 M.G.J. Löder and G. Gerdts
The fraction >500 µm was stored and not considered further in this study. The 
material passing through the sieve was homogenized and analyzed.
For the extraction of microplastics 10 g of each sediment sample were treated 
with 50 ml 30 % hydrogen peroxide overnight to remove natural organic material. After a second drying step, microplastic particles were extracted via density separa-tion in zinc chloride solution (1.5 g cm
−3) in a 100-ml glass beaker. After stirring 
the sample was treated in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min and the beaker kept covered overnight for the sedimentation of sand particles. Potential microplastic particles that accumulated at the surface of the zinc chloride solution were sampled with a syringe and finally filtered onto gray, pre-washed cellulose nitrate filters with a pore size of 1.2 µm and a grid of 3.1 mm. The filters were dried for further analysis.
8.5.1.3  Visual Quantification of Microplastics
The pre-washed filters were weighed to obtain the amount of potential micro-
plastics per 10 g sediment sample. Particles were counted under the bright-field microscope at 20–80-fold magnifications differentiating visually between granu-lar/spherical microplastics, fragments and fibrous microplastics. After analysis, the material on the filters was gently transferred into small glass vials for storage prior to FTIR analyses.
8.5.1.4  FPA-based Micro-FTIR Spectroscopy
Large numbers of particles, especially granular material, were detected when 
counting the material on the filters. Since a solely optical classification does not enable a reliable identification of particles as microplastics, the NLWKN selected ten samples (beach, eulittoral and sublittoral samples, for details see Table 8.1) for 
FTIR analysis to determine the polymer origin and composition of the microplas-tic particles in the samples. Each complete microplastic sample or a subsample thereof as large as possible was carefully transferred to a circular calcium fluo-ride crystal sample carrier (13 mm diameter, 1 mm thickness) for FTIR analysis. The objective of the FTIR analyses was to identify the polymer origin of at least 20 particles of each of the aforementioned classification types (spherical-granular, fragments and fibres) distinguished during previous counting. Prior to the FTIR measurements, a microscopic overview picture (40-fold magnification; bright-field) of each sample was taken to identify sample regions with conspicuous par -
ticles (Fig. 8.2). Because of the general scarcity of fragments and fibres and the high abundance of granular particles, areas with those rare particle types present were selected. Thus the measurements were not random. Black particles showed hardly interpretable IR spectra because of their high absorption of IR radiation and were, thus, not given priority during the measurements.
FTIR spectra of particles were recorded using a Bruker HYPERION 3000 FTIR 
microscope equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled 64 ×  64 detector elements focal 217

plane array detector (FPA) with a 15 ×  IR objective. The microscope was coupled 
with a TENSOR 27 spectrometer. IR spectra were recorded in transmission mode as 
average spectra by calculating the arithmetic mean of 32 scans in the range 3850–900 cm
−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1 and a 6 mm aperture.
Depending on the amount of regions with conspicuous particles, between 20 
and 65 FPA fields were measured per sample after manual focusing of the micro-scope. A single FPA field covered an area of 170 × 170 µm with a lateral pixel resolution of 2.7 µm (Bruker Optics) and ca. 40 s were needed for a measurement. Background measurements were performed on the blank sample carrier prior to each sample measurement. The measurements were processed with the software “OPUS 7.0” (Bruker Optics). The polymer origin of particles was identified by comparison with a self-generated polymer library in OPUS 7.0. For creating this library, we measured (ATR-FTIR) pre-production plastic pellets, powders and films of the most commonly used consumer-plastic polymers provided by different plastic polymer manufacturers. Currently, the library consists of 128 plastic poly-mer records and several other marine abiotic and biotic materials (e.g. cellulose, quartz, chitin, silicate, keratin) and will be expanded in the future.
8.5.2  Results
8.5.2.1  FPA-based Micro-FTIR Analysis of Pre-extracted Particles  in Sediment Samples
Between 29 and 64 particles per sample were analyzed by FTIR microscopy resulting in a total number of 404 particles analyzed from the ten samples pro-vided by the NLWKN. Only 16 particles (12 fragments and 4 fibres), i.e. 4 % of the total number of investigated particles, differed in their shape from the abundant granular material.
8.5.2.2  Granular Particles
With 388 counts the majority (96 %) of the particles could clearly be assigned to 
the category of granular particles. Most of the granular particles were transpar -
ent to whitish-opaque and between 100 and 300 µm in size (Fig. 8.2). Of these, 320 particles showed a spectrum that strongly differed from common polymer IR spectra. By comparison with the IR spectrum of laboratory quartz (p.a. grade, Merck) we were able to show, that all these particles were in fact quartz sand and not microplastics (Fig. 8.3). 68 further granular particles that were very similar in shape and appearance to the quartz particles also displayed non-polymer spectra. These spectra were similar to the quartz spectra (Fig. 8.4) and were thus certainly 
also of mineral origin. However, because of the lack of reference spectra a definite identification was not possible in those cases.219

8.5.2.3  Fragments and Fibres
Within the 16 particles that differed from the granular material, we found four 
black malleable fragments with a size between 260 and 390 µm, which exhibited high absorbance and showed non-interpretable transmission IR spectra (Fig. 8.5). According to their bitumen-like, malleable properties and coloration, those par -
ticles are most likely oil residues from ship spillages or road wear. In total, six particles were of biological origin. Four particles of fibrous appearance (length: 290–900 µm, width 16–100 µm) showed organic IR spectra similar to cellulose and were most likely of plant origin. Two particles (200–800 µm) exhibited chitin-like IR spectra and were thus assigned to particles of animal origin.
Within the differentially shaped particles, only six fragments (i.e. 1.4 %) of the 
analyzed particles, displayed a plastic polymer spectrum. Three fragment-shaped particles in the size between 440–1200 µm were polystyrene and another three fragments between 180–450 µm were polyethylene (Fig. 8.6). With the help of chemical imaging the localization of characteristic spectra within the measured area could be visualized accurately and the microplastic particles could be identi-fied (Fig. 8.7).
8.5.3  Summary
As a consequence of the applied sample extraction and purification techniques, it was assumed that the provided samples should have comprised mainly micro-plastic fragments and other organic material of low density. However, plastic fragments were exceptionally rare as they made up only 1.4 % of all analyzed particles. Since we manually screened the bright-field microscopic images for areas with heterogeneous particle appearance and measured at these locations, it can be assumed, that in total, the abundance of microplastics in the samples was

even lower. Surprisingly, the majority of particles could be clearly identified as 
quartz particles, although these should have been excluded via the density separa-tion step. While it remains to be clarified why the samples contained such large amounts of sand grains, the case study proves the absolute necessity of spectro-scopic (e.g. FTIR) measurements for microplastics analysis. In this context FPA-based micro-FTIR spectroscopy proved to be a very promising technique for verifying polymer origin of microplastic particles and thus should be mandatorily included in future monitoring programs on microplastics after SOPs for the purifi-cation and measurement approaches have been established.Fig. 8.6  Examples of the IR

8.6  Conclusions
Currently, the reliability and comparability of data on marine microplastic concen-
trations is hampered by the huge variety of different methodologies applied, which lead to the generation of data of extremely different quality (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012). Thus, one basic aim must be the standardization of methodologies for iden-tification and quantification of microplastics in the marine environment and the subsequent formulation of standard operating procedures (SOPs). This involves the whole cycle of the assessment of microplastics in environmental samples from sam-pling procedures to sample purification and identification of microplastic particles.
More research is needed in the field of representative sampling designs, espe-
cially when it comes to sampling sediments on beaches. Although sampling in itself is no challenge, choosing the appropriate sampling locations and num-ber of replicates to representatively describe the plastic contamination of a highly dynamic environment such as a beach is indeed challenging. The suggestions by the TSG-ML (Hanke et al. 2013) are first steps towards a standardization of beach sam-pling within the microplastics monitoring programs of the member states of the EU.

8 Methodology Used for the Detection and Identification …
Depending on the mesh size used, plankton or neuston nets allow for ade-
quate sampling of a certain size class of microplastics from the water column or 
from surface waters. However, since nets can easily clog, especially the biologi-cally important fraction of particles <100 µm is often severely underrepresented. Sequential size fractionated filtering of large volumes of water is a very promising technique that could provide a remedy for this problem although the applicability has yet to be proven in the field. Techniques for sampling microplastics in biologi-cal material are as variable as the biota themselves and thus a general standardi-zation cannot be achieved. For the monitoring of microplastics in single species, such as the northern fulmar, long-term observations could lead to the establish-ment of standardized sampling procedures.
Sample preparation should involve a size fractionation of particles larger and 
smaller than 500 µm as suggested by Hidalgo-Ruz et al. (2012) (alternatively 1000 µm, TSG-ML, Hanke et al. 2013) to enable comparability of data from dif-ferent studies including studies that focus on particles <500 µm. Currently, no SOP exists for extraction solutions and techniques used to extract microplastic particles from samples. The use of extraction solutions of lower densities (e.g. NaCl) results in underestimation of microplastics of higher densities. Zinc chloride is a rela-tively cheap and recyclable solution that can be used to produce high-density solu-tions, which extract the whole spectrum of common user plastics. Furthermore, we suggest using separation techniques with high recovery rates in the whole size spectrum of microplastic particles at low temporal and personal effort such as the Microplastic Sediment Separator (Imhof et al. 2012).
Identification by spectroscopy is essential, especially for particles <500 µm. 
The quality of the spectroscopic results relies strongly on effective sample puri-fication. Purifying steps with agents that negatively affect certain plastic poly-mers (e.g. strong acidic or alkaline solutions) should be avoided to conserve the whole spectrum of plastic contamination within an environmental sample. Gentle approaches such as sequential enzymatic digestion have been successfully applied by the authors and provide efficient purification for subsequent spectroscopic analysis. The contamination of microplastic samples during the whole assess-ment procedure from sampling to analysis is a highly urgent topic that needs to be addressed by standardised contamination prevention techniques. In this context, the avoidance of plastic material as far as possible as well as the use of control samples should be implemented as key elements of microplastics investigations.
An example of recent research by the authors showed that the commonly 
applied visual inspection of samples alone is insufficient to identify microplas-tic particles in environmental samples. This is especially the case for particles <500 µm, which have to be concentrated on filters for analysis. In this context, a spectroscopic verification of microplastic particles by micro-Raman or micro-FTIR spectroscopy is essential and has also been used successfully for analyz-ing marine samples. Spectroscopic techniques create an added value as they also provide information on the polymer composition. Although FTIR spectroscopy has been used more frequently in microplastics research (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012) Raman spectroscopy is of equal value for analyzing microplastic samples. 224 M.G.J. Löder and G. Gerdts
By combining spectroscopic techniques with fast area-resolved measurements, 
with e.g. FPA detectors, and chemical imaging, it is possible to scan whole sam-ple filters in a fraction of time compared to chemical mapping with single detec-tors (Harrison et al. 2012). However, SOPs for the use of this highly promising novel techniques are not accessible at present but will soon be published (Löder et al. 2015). The standardized use of spectroscopy in microplastic research finally enables the generation of valid data on concentrations, particle size distribu-tion, involved polymers and distribution among different marine habitats and in marine biota. This is essential to guarantee comparability of different data sets. Furthermore, the data generated will serve as basis for the design of realistic labo-ratory experiments on the impact of microplastics on marine biota. These steps are crucial for a reliable evaluation and the assessment of potential impacts and risks of microplastics in the world’s oceans.

M. Bergmann et al. (eds.), Marine Anthropogenic Litter,  DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-16510-3_9Abstract Identifying and eliminating the sources of microplastic to habitats is 
crucial to reducing the social, environmental and economic impacts of this form 
of debris. Although eliminating sources of pollution is a fundamental component of environmental policy in the U.S.A. and Europe, the sources of microplastic and their pathways into habitats remain poorly understood compared to other persis-tent, bioaccumulative and/or toxic substances (i.e. priority pollutants; EPA in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2010–2014 Pollution Prevention (P2) Program Strategic Plan. Washington, USA, pp. 1–34, 2010; EU in Official J Eur Union L334:17–119, 2010). This chapter reviews our understanding of sources and path-ways of microplastic, appraises terminology, and outlines future directions for meaningfully integrating research, managerial actions and policy to understand and reduce the infiltration of microplastic to habitats.

9.1  Defining Sources and Pathways of Microplastic
Since the first review of microplastic (Browne et al. 2007), a number of terms 
have been used to describe and categorize sources of microplastic. Some authors have used the terms “primary” and “secondary” to distinguish between sources of microplastic, in which they borrow terminology from atmos-pheric sciences (Arthur et al. 2009; Cole et al. 2011). In these cases, “primary sources” are those in which microplastic is intentionally produced through extrusion or grinding, either as precursors to other products (e.g. plastic pellets; Costa et al. 2010) or for direct use (e.g. abrasives in cleaning products or roto-milling), whilst “secondary sources” of microplastics are those formed in the environment from the fragmentation of larger plastic material into ever-smaller pieces (Arthur et al. 2009; Cole et al. 2011). Using similar ideas, Andrady (2011) described runoff as a “direct source” (sewage or storm water) whilst 
fragmentation of existing plastic debris was described as “indirect source” of microplastic to the environment.
Although using adjectives to categorize sources may be helpful, these terms 
introduce jargon without clearly identifying the actual sources and conflate sources with the pathway by which microplastic enter habitats, which may in turn confuse scientists, public, industry and government. In this chapter, I argue that these problems can be overcome if we choose alternative terms for sources  
that identify the place, person, company, or product where the microplastic orig-inates and use separate terms to describe the pathways of microplastic from its 
source to a habitat.
Based upon our current understanding there are four types of sources (i) 
larger plastic litter, (ii) cleaning products (Zitko and Hanlon 1991; Gregory 
1996; Derraik 2002); (iii) medicines; and (iv) textiles. For the latter, I have cho-sen to use a global case-study to illustrate how one can gain a more meaningful and scientific understanding of the sources and pathways of microplastic through developing better programs of research and monitoring that integrate advances in forensics (e.g. vibrational spectroscopy to identify the shape and type of microplastic), logic and experimental design (i.e. making observations, devel-oping explanatory models, testing explicit hypotheses about composition and spatial patterns; Underwood 1997) and statistics. Throughout the chapter, I have chosen to define microplastic as micrometre-sized particles of plastic because this is consistent with previous work on this topic (Browne et al. 2007, 2008, 
2010, 2011, 2013; Costa et al. 2009; Claessens et al. 2011; Rochman et al. 2013; 
Van Cauwenberghe 2013) and the globally ratified use of the prefix “micro” for measures of length under the International System of Units. Other authors have chosen to ignore the International System of Units definition of “micro” and have instead chosen to use <5 mm to define microplastic, a philosophical discus-sion about which people should use is beyond the scope of this review.231
9 Sources and Pathways of Microplastics to Habitats
9.2  Larger Plastic Litter
Sources. Larger plastic debris originates from maritime activities including ship-
ping, fishing (e.g. Merrell Jr 1980, Ramirez-Llodra et al. 2013; Galgani et al. 2015), recreation and offshore industries (e.g. oil, gas). These sources are, however, likely to be much smaller than terrestrial sources. Whatever the source, larger plastic litter (including millimetre-sized pre-production pellets) is likely to be an important source of microplastic. Irregularly shaped fragments are abundant in intertidal and oceanic habitats with the size-frequency of plastic debris skewed towards smaller debris. This suggests that microplastic can originate from the fragmentation of larger objects that causes ever smaller pieces of plastic to be present in the environment (Browne et al. 2007, 2010; Morét-Ferguson et al. 2010; Collignon et al. 2012; Fig. 9.1a–c).
Pathways. Fragmentation is the pathway, by which plastic debris breaks into 
smaller pieces, which is distinct from the more subtle processes of degradation that reduces the molecular mass of plastic debris (Andrady 2011, 2015). These processes 
occur through the action of light (photolysis), heat and oxygen (thermal-oxidation), water (hydrolysis), organisms (see review by Andrady (2011) for more details about weathering experiments with pieces of plastic >1 mm) and physical abrasion by particles of sediment. Laboratory and field experiments are required to determine the relative importance of these processes in generating the sizes and shapes of micrometre-sized plastic that we find in habitats. One such laboratory experiment by Davidson (2012) showed that each time a single isopod (Sphaeroma quoianum) burrows into a floating dock made of expanded polystyrene they can produce and release between 4900 and 6300 micrometre-sized fragments of polystyrene. There is also a modest literature on plastic degradation in marine habitats (Andrady and Pegram 1989; Andrady 2003; Gregory and Andrady 2003; Corcoran et al. 2009; 
Cooper and Corcoran 2010; O’Brine and Thompson 2010). But the rigour of these

studies varies with some lacking many of the ecological developments in designing, 
implementing and analysing manipulative field experiments (Underwood 1997 ). So 
far, no one has experimentally deployed micrometre-sized plastic (or millimetre-
sized pellets) in habitats to determine the rates at which it fragments into smaller 
pieces. Thus, the role of pellets as major sources of microplastic is unclear.
9.3  Cleaning Products
Sources.  Another source of microplastic is from industrial and domestic cleaning 
products that use microplastic as an abrasive scrubber (Browne et  al. 2007 ). For 
instance, surfaces of buildings, machinery and boats can be cleaned and prepared 
(e.g. smoothed, roughened, shaped) using ‘media blasting’, where small plastics 
(e.g. polystyrene, acrylic, polyester, poly-allyl-diglycol-carbonate, urea-, melamine- 
and phenol-formaldehyde; 0.25–1.7  mm; DOD 1992 ) and other types of granules 
(e.g. sand) are propelled onto a surface using a centrifugal wheel or pressurized 
fluid/gas (Wolbach and McDonald 1987 ; Abbott 1992 ; Gregory 1996 ; Neulicht and 
Shular 1997 ; Anonymous 1998 ). Although ‘media blasting’ has been suspected of 
being a source of microplastic to habitats there has been no scientific work to (i) 
characterize the number of industries using this technique, (ii) the size, shape and 
amount of microplastic used in the process of cleaning and (iii) the quantity of par -
ticles emitted into, or found within, the environment through this source.
More work has been done for microplastics used as physical abrasives in domes -
tic products. Fendall and Sewell ( 2009 ) qualitatively showed that the size and shape 
of microplastic in such products varies (Fig.  9.2). By examining four different 
facial cleansers with labels that indicated they contained particles of polyethylene, 
they found that the size of the particles ranged from 4.1 to 1240  μm in diameter, 
and consisted of uniform spheres, ellipses, rods, fibres and granules (Fig.  9.2). 
For granules this presents a problem because it will be very difficult to differenti -
ate whether they come from cleaning products or from the fragmentation of larger

articles of plastic debris. Using vibrational spectrometry Zitko and Hanlon (1991) 
found that 47 % of the mass of the contents of a single bottle of skin cleanser was made up of irregular fragments of polystyrene (100–200 μ m). A separate study 
that used vibrational spectrometry showed replicate formulations of hand cleans-ers between 0.2 and 4 % of their mass made up of polyethylene, whilst for facial 
cleansers it was 2–3 % (Gregory 1996), though it is important to note that this study did not report particle numbers <63 μ m in size, which may account for the smaller 
amounts recorded. Gouin et al. (2011) estimated the emission of microplastic from cleaning products in the U.S. by combining estimates of sales figures and assuming proportions of polyethylene were 10 % by volume. From this, the authors calcu-lated that each year the U.S. could be emitting 263 t of micrometre-sized fragments of polyethylene from domestic cleaning products. Given that the type of polymer (e.g. polyethylene, polystyrene) and proportions of microplastic can vary from 0.2 to 47 %, it seems that more work is needed to test individual products and different batches so that we can provide precise, accurate and ground-truthed estimates of microplastic emissions from cleaning products.
Pathways. Microplastics used in cleaning products are thought to transfer to habi-
tats through sewage and storm water (Fig. 9.3). The quantities of microplastic, how-
ever, in water or sediment from habitats, sewage or storm water are unknown because they are interspersed with large concentrations of organic matter, and because it is dif-ficult to distinguish uniform spheres, ellipses and granules with a biofilm from natural particles. Some of these problems may be overcome with the application of chemical techniques to remove organic matter (Claessens et al. 2013) and vibrational spectro-scopes that can map microplastic in environmental samples (Harrison et al. 2012).
Fig. 9.3  Sources and pathways of microplastic from cleaning products into habitats. Gray 
arrows indicate hypothesized pathways. There are no black arrows because there is currently no 
research showing evidence of these pathways234 M.A. Browne
9.4  Medicines
Sources. Ingestible and inhalable medicines containing microplastic are used to 
deliver drugs to the organs of humans and farmed animals (terrestrial and aquatic) because the microplastic can translocate from their lungs or guts into their circula-tory system (Thanoo et al. 1993; Dalmon et al. 1995; Curley et al. 1996; Hussain et al. 2001; Matsusaki et al. 2001; Wen et al. 2003; Kockisch et al. 2003; Corbanie et al. 2006). There has, however, been no work to synthesize information about the 
different types of polymers and sizes of microplastic used in medicines because this information does not seem to be readily available.
Pathways. Like microplastics in cleaning products, microplastics from medicines 
are likely to transfer to habitats through sewage and storm water, or more directly through treating diseased animals in aquaculture and farming. There is, however, no quantitative work evaluating how much plastic is taken up by animals and excreted compared to those retained in tissues. As such, the quantities of medical microplas-tic in water or sediment sampled from habitats, sewage or storm water are unknown. Research is needed to synthesize a complete inventory of these polymers so that sam-ples from humans, sewage, storm water, wildlife and habitats can be tested for the presence of these polymers. Some of the polymers used are thought to be biodegrad-able (Matsusaki et al. 2001), whist others can be composed of more durable polymers such as polycarbonate and polystyrene (Thanoo et al. 1993; Dunn et al. 1994). The rates and mechanisms of degradation inside human tissues may not be the same as in wildlife or habitats. Moreover, just because a polymer degrades, does not necessarily mean that the resulting metabolites are not toxic themselves: So, research is needed to determine how safe these particles are in humans, wildlife and habitats.
9.5  Textiles
Many people have attempted to examine the sources of microplastic but a lack of a hypothesis-driven framework has meant that sources and pathways are poorly understood. More useful understanding about the sources and pathways of micro-plastic to habitats comes from work done on fibres that originate from textiles and clothing (Browne et al. 2011). The following case study is provided to illustrate 
how one can understand better the sources and pathways of microplastic (Browne et al. 2011). The work was done in four phases by examining microplastic in (i) sediment from sandy shores worldwide; (ii) sediment from replicated sub-tidal areas where sewage sludge had, and had not, been discharged; (iii) effluent from replicate treatment plants; and finally; (iv) effluent from manipulative experiments involving washing machines.
(i) A global program to sample sediment from sandy shores. Between 2004 and 
2007 samples of sediment were collected from sandy beaches in Australia, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Chile, Philippines, Azores, USA, South Africa, 235
9 Sources and Pathways of Microplastics to Habitats
Mozambique and the U.K. During collection (and in all work), cotton cloth-
ing was worn rather than synthetic items to prevent samples being contami-nated by plastic fibres. Samples were collected by working down-wind to the particular part of the highest strandline deposited by the previous tide. Using established techniques, sediment was sampled to a depth of 1 cm and micro-plastic and sediment was quantified using established techniques (Browne et al. 2010, 2011). Two explanatory models for pathways of microplastic in 
habitats were put forward to explain spatial patterns of microplastic.
If spatial patterns of microplastic result from the transportation of natural particu-lates by currents of water (Model 1), we expected shores that accumulate smaller-sized particles of sediment would accumulate more microplastic (Hypothesis 1).  
Alternatively, spatial patterns may be influenced by sources of microplastic (Model 2). Over the last 50 years the global population density of humans had increased by 250 % from 19 to 48 individuals km
−2 (UN 2008), and during this 
time the abundance of microplastic had increased in pelagic habitats (Thompson et al. 2004). Previous observations had suggested that there was a greater abun-dance of larger items of debris along shorelines adjacent to densely populated areas (Barnes 2005). This led to the prediction that there would be more micro-plastic along shorelines adjacent to densely populated areas (Hypothesis 2). The work showed that microplastic contaminated all 18 shores examined (Fig. 9.4) with more microplastic in sediments collected from densely populated areas (lin-ear regression, F
1,16 = 8.36, P < 0.05, n = 18, r2 = 0.34; Fig. 9.5), but there was 
no relationship with the quantity of smaller-sized particles of sediment. Thus, there was evidence to support Model 2 but not Model 1.
To examine the pathway of this microplastic onto shorelines, forensic analy-
sis was used to gather crucial observations about the shapes and types of poly-mers that made up the microplastic. This showed that the microplastic was mostly made up of synthetic fibres that consisted of polyester (56 %), acrylic (23 %),

polypropylene (7 %), polyethylene (6 %) and polyamide (3 %). Previous observa-
tions had shown that coastal habitats receive millions of tonnes of sewage each year (CEFAS 1997) and that sewage can contain microplastic fibres (Habib et al. 1996; Zubris and Richards 2005) because although larger debris is removed during the treatment of sewage, filters are not specifically designed to retain microplas-tic. Model 2 was therefore refined to include sewage as the pathway of synthetic 
fibres to marine habitats causing greater quantities of microplastic fibres in areas adjacent to densely populated areas (Model 2.1). The next step was then to test this model to determine whether there was evidence to support the model that the discharge of sewage was an important pathway of microplastic fibres into marine habitats.
(ii) Comparison of sub-tidal areas where sewage sludge had been discharged with 
reference areas. Previous observations from coastal habitats of the U.K. sug-gested that each year treatment plants discharge >11 km
3 of sewage effluent 
into coastal habitats (CEFAS 1997) and for nearly 30 years, a quarter of U.K. sewage sludge was dumped at 13 designated sub-tidal disposal-sites around the coast, until this stopped in 1998 through implementation of The Urban Waste Water Treatment Regulations 1994 (Fig. 9.6; CEFAS 1997; British Government 1994). Using replicate disposal-sites and reference-sites allowed us to test Hypothesis 2.1 that sediments from disposal-sites would contain larger quantities of fibres in their sediments and that the shape and types of polymers that make up the microplastic would resemble those found on shores. For this, van Veen grabs deployed from boats collected replicate sam-ples of sediment from two reference-sites and two disposal-sites in the English Channel and the North Sea (U.K.). Despite sewage not being added for more than a decade, disposal-sites still contained >250 % more fibres than refer -
ence sites (Fig. 9.7; ANOV A, F
1,16 = 4.50, P < 0.05). Again the types of fibres 
were dominated by polyester (78 %) and acrylic (22 %).
During discussions with the sewage treatment authorities they explained that fil-ters are not specifically designed to retain microplastic, which suggests that dis-charges of sewage effluent could also be a pathway of fibres from treatment plants Fig. 9.5  Relationship

to habitats (Model 2.2). To test this model we examined the hypothesis that dis-
charges of sewage effluent would contain similar proportions of polyester and acrylic fibres. As expected, polyester (67 %) and acrylic (17 %) fibres polyam-ide (16 %) dominated. These proportions of polyester and acrylic fibres resembled those contaminating intertidal and subtidal habitats (Fig. 9.8) suggesting that these microplastic fibres were mainly derived from sewage via washing-clothes rather 
than fragmentation or cleaning products. In recent years, the clothing industry has used textiles that contain >170 % more synthetics than natural fibres (e.g. cotton, wool, silk) and because proportions of fibres found in marine habitats and sewage resembled those used for textiles (78 % polyester, 9 % polyamide, 7 % polypro-pylene, 5 % acrylic; Oerlikon 2009) we counted the number of fibres discharged into wastewater from using clothes and garments.
(iii) Experiments with washing machines. Here, experimental work counted 
the number of fibres discharged into waste water from domestic washing machines used to launder clothing. To estimate the number of fibres enter -
ing wastewater from washing clothes and garments, three replicate wash-ing machines were used with and without cloth (polyester blankets, fleeces, shirts). Effluent was filtered and microplastic counted. The experiments showed all garments released >100 fibres per litre of effluent, with >180 % more from fleeces (>1900 fibres per wash; Fig. 9.9), demonstrating that a large proportion of microplastic fibres found in marine habitats may be derived from sewage as a consequence of washing of clothes.Fig. 9.8  Abundance of

9 Sources and Pathways of Microplastics to Habitats
9.6  Outlook and Conclusion
In the future, contamination by microplastic is likely to continue to increase. 
Populations of humans are predicted to double in the next 40 years (UN 2008) and 
further concentrate in large coastal cities that will discharge larger volumes of sew-age into marine habitats. The last case study provides a useful approach for identifying and quantifying sources and pathways of microplastic that should be extended to other sources, including medical and cleaning products, by screening sewage, storm water, habitats, wildlife and humans for the types of microplastic found in these products.
In parallel to this, I believe work is needed to reduce and eliminate sources and 
pathways of microplastic through (i) establishing and controlling inventories of materi-als; (ii) modifying the process of production by redesigning products so that they con-tain less hazardous substances; and (iii) using novel equipment and technology. This section now explores some of current opportunities for the public, scientists, engineers, industry and government to reduce sources and pathways of microplastic.
(i) Establishing and controlling inventories that detail the use and emissions of 
microplastics in products. Inventories are frequently used by European (EA 2012) and U.S. government agencies (EPA 2010, 2012) to control emis-
sions of pollutants. An open-access online inventory is urgently required for textiles, medicines and cleaning products containing microplastic so that we have accurate information about emissions of microplastic during their pro-duction, use and disposal. This should include information about the use and emissions of microplastic, in terms of dimensions of size (i.e. minimum, max-imum, median, mode and mean) shape, numbers, mass, types of polymers and sales figures. Because industry has, on occasion, been unwilling to provide this information when requested (Rosner 2008), this will probably require a change in policy and specific funding for representative sampling so that measures are accurate and precise (Figs. 9.10 and 9.11).
(ii) Modifying the process of production and redesigning products so that they contain less hazardous substances. Currently there are no published data on the effectiveness of modifying the process of production of products to reduce emissions of microplastic, since microplastic is not currently considered haz-ardous by policy-makers (Rochman et al. 2013). In response to advocacy from 
scientists and activists, several companies who make domestic cleaning prod-ucts (e.g. Unilever, Johnson & Johnson) have agreed to replace microplastic with non-plastic particles. It is, however, unclear what alternatives they will use (Alumina; pumice; seeds of strawberries, blueberries, cranberry, even-ing primrose, grapes, kiwi or raspberry; stones of apricots, avocados, olives or peaches; peel of oranges or mandarin; castor or jojoba beads, shells of cocoa, coconuts, almonds or walnuts; coir; corn cob; salt; sugar; luffa, rice; macadamia nuts) or whether they will be more or less toxic to humans and wildlife, so scientific research is needed to find the most cost-effective alter -
native. Similar research is needed within the textile and clothing industry so that they produce cost-effective clothing that sheds fewer and less toxic fibres.  240 M.A. Browne

9 Sources and Pathways of Microplastics to Habitats
These types of research are important to ensure decisions by policy-makers 
are based on robust scientific information as opposed to untested perceptions of the hazards of synthetic materials over those made from natural products.
(iii) Novel equipment and technology to reduce pathways of microplastic. Filters for washing machines are a promising prospect for reducing emissions of fibres to sewage (www.environmentalenhancements.com); however, their effective-ness in reducing emissions has not been tested as yet. Work is also needed to determine how effective different types of sewage treatment are at removing the different sizes, shapes and types of polymers that represent the microplas-tic found in sewage. However, unless the microplastic can be isolated from the sludge or effluent there are still likely to be problems because sewage is added to soil as a fertilizer. To identify the place, company or product where the micro-plastic originates requires government, industry and scientists to work together and share information. For this to happen there needs to be policies that (i) provide funded frameworks to measure (and if necessary manage) sources and pathways of microplastic into the environment; (ii) balance the needs of indus-tries, society and the environment. In the U.S., 16 persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic chemicals (i.e. aldrin, benzoperylene, chlordane, heptachlor, hexa-chlorobenzene, isodrin, lead, mercury, methoxychlor, octachlorostyrene, pen-dimethalin, pentachlorobenzene, polychlorinated biphenyl, tetrabromobisphenol A,  toxaphene and trifluralin) are controlled in this way using the Emergency 
Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act 1986. The Community Right-to-Know provisions help to increase public’s knowledge and access to information on chemicals at individual facilities, their uses, and releases into the environ-ment. Through this facilities are obliged to share information with government, scientists and public to improve chemical safety and protect public health and the environment. Similar requirements are required in Europe under article 5 of the Directive 2008/105/EC where member states are obliged to establish an inventory of emissions, discharges and losses of priority pollutants listed in part A of Annex I (EU 2012). For microplastic, several other solutions could also help. For instance, polymers could be designed with unique chemical fin-gerprints (that identify particular sites of production or use), which remain even after the polymer has been physically or chemically degraded during its time in the environment. Alternatively, prior to a product being licensed for sale on the market place, information on the composition of polymers (and additives) in commercial applications could be made available to environmental scientists so that the environmental sources and pathways of materials can be quantified and  managed if needed. Whatever developments take place, hypothesis-driven 
frameworks are required to identify and falsify sources and pathways.
In conclusion, if we are to use terms to describe the sources of microplastic they should aim to identify the origin (e.g. larger plastic litter, cleaning products,  medicines, textiles, etc.) and separate terms should be used for the pathways  
(e.g. storm water, sewage). As researchers use more integrated hypothesis-driven 
frameworks and the chemical methods and inventories improve, it may be possible to be more specific (e.g. the place, person or company).242 M.A. Browne

Microplastics in the Marine Environment: 
Distribution, Interactions and Effects

© The Author(s) 2015 
M. Bergmann et al. (eds.), Marine Anthropogenic Litter,  DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-16510-3_10Abstract Microplastics are an emerging marine pollutant. It is important to 
understand their distribution in the marine environment and their implications on 
marine habitats and marine biota. Microplastics have been found in almost every marine habitat around the world, with plastic composition and environmental con-ditions significantly affecting their distribution. Marine biota interact with micro-plastics including birds, fish, turtles, mammals and invertebrates. The biological repercussions depend on to the size of microplastics encountered, with smaller sizes having greater effects on organisms at the cellular level. In the micrometre range plastics are readily ingested and egested, whereas nanometre-sized plastics can pass through cell membranes. Despite concerns raised by ingestion, the effects of microplastic ingestion in natural populations and the implications for food webs are not understood. Without knowledge of retention and egestion rates of field populations, it is difficult to deduce ecological consequences. There is evidence to suggest that microplastics enter food chains and there is trophic transfer between predators and prey. What is clear is that further research on a variety of marine organisms is required to understand the environmental implications of microplas-tics in more detail and to establish effects in natural populations.

10.1  Introduction
With the increasing reliance on plastics as an everyday item, and rapid increase 
in their production and subsequent disposal, the environmental implications of plastics are a growing concern. The benefits of plastics, including their dura-bility and resistance to degradation, inversely result in negative environmental impacts. As user-plastics are primarily “single use” items they are generally disposed of within one year of production, and whilst some plastic waste is recycled, the majority ends up in land-fill. Concerns arise when plastics enter the marine environment through indiscriminate disposal and it has been esti-mated that up to 10 % of plastic debris produced will enter the sea (Thompson 2006). Interactions between litter and the marine environment are complex. The impacts of larger plastic debris are discussed by Kühn et al. (2015) and con-sequences include aesthetic, social and economic issues (Newman et al. 2015), and numerous environmental impacts on marine biota (Derraik 2002; Barnes et al. 2009). However, with an ever increasing reliance on plastic products, and as plastic production, use and disposal continue, microplastics are of increas-ing concern (Sutherland et al. 2010). Microplastics enter the sea from a variety of sources (Browne 2015) and distributed by oceans currents; these ubiquitous contaminants are widespread (Cózar et al. 2014). The amount of microplastics in the sea will continue to rise, leading to gradual but significant accumulation in coastal and marine environments (Andrady and Neal 2009).
Increasing evidence of microplastics in the sea has led to a need to under -
stand its environmental impacts as a form of marine pollution. A recent review of marine debris research found only 10 % of publications to focus on microplas-tics, the majority of which were from the last decade (CBD 2012). Even though plastic is the primary constituent of marine debris, microplastics are considered under-researched due to difficulties in assessing their distribution and abundance (Doyle et al. 2011). It has only been in recent years that international, national and regional efforts were made to quantify microplastics in the sea. The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD, 2008/56/EC) has highlighted concerns for environmental implications of marine litter and one of the key attributes of the MSFD is to determine the ecological harm caused by microplastics and their asso-ciated chemicals (Zarfl et al. 2011).
Microplastics were first described as microscopic particles in the region 
of 20 µm diameter (Thompson et al. 2004). For the purpose of this study,  microplastic refers to items <5 mm in size using the criteria developed by US 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (Arthur et al. 2009). The small size of microplastics makes them available for interaction with marine biota in different trophic levels. By inhabiting different marine habitats, a range of organisms are vulnerable to exposure (Wright et al. 2013a). At the millimetre and micrometre scale, sorption of microplastics is dominated by bulk portion-ing, with effects including blockages when fibres or fragments form aggregates. 247
10 Microplastics in the Marine Environment …
Whereas at smaller size ranges, specifically the nanometre scale, there is a poten-
tial for microplastics to cause harm to organisms (Galloway 2015; Koelmans 
et al. 2015). Additionally, the consequences of exposure to chemicals associated with plastics are being investigated (Rochman 2015). A widely cited hypothesis explores how the large surface area to volume ratio of microplastics leaves them prone to adsorbing waterborne organic pollutants and the potential for toxic plasti-cisers to leach from polymer matrices into organisms tissues (Teuten et al. 2007). It was further hypothesized that if subsequently ingested, microplastics may act as a route for toxin introduction to the food chain (Teuten et al. 2009). Whether microplastics act as vectors depends on the gradient between microplastics and biota lipids (Koelmans 2015).
It is important to understand the transport and distribution of microplastics 
before understanding their fate, including the physical and chemical effects they could have on marine organisms. The objectives of this chapter are to assess the environmental impact of microplastic in the sea by: (1) summarising the distribution of marine microplastics, including the use of models to under -
stand the distribution; (2) determine the interaction of microplastics with marine organisms.
10.2  The Global Distribution of Microplastics in the Sea
From strandlines on beaches to the deep seafloor and throughout the water col-umn, microplastic research is dominated by studies monitoring microplastic dis-tribution and abundance in the marine environment (Ivar du Sol and Costa 2014). A recent estimate suggested there could be between 7000 and 35,000 tons of plas-tic floating in the open ocean (Cózar et al. 2014). Another study estimated that more than five trillion pieces of plastic and >250,000 t are currently floating in the 
oceans (Eriksen et al. 2014). Once in the sea microplastics are transported around the globe by ocean currents where they persist and accumulate. Microplastics are suspended in the water column (e.g. Lattin et al. 2004), surface waters (e.g. Cózar et al. 2014), coastal waters (e.g. Ng and Obbard 2006), estuaries (e.g. Browne 
et al. 2010), rivers (Sadri and Thompson 2014), beaches (e.g. Browne et al. 2011) and deep-sea sediments (Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013b; Woodall et al. 2014; Fischer et al. 2015). Suspended in the water column, microplastics can become trapped by ocean currents and accumulate in central ocean regions (e.g. Law et al. 2010). Ocean gyres and convergent zones are noteworthy areas of debris accumu-lation, as the rotational pattern of currents cause high concentrations of plastics to be captured and moved towards the centre of the region (Karl 1999). As gyres are present in all of the world’s oceans, microplastic accumulation can occur at a global scale and has been documented during the past four decades. Distribution is further influenced by wind mixing, affecting the vertical movement of plastics 248 A. Lusher
(Kukulka et al. 2012). Physical characteristics of plastic polymers, including their 
density, can influence their distribution in the water column and benthic habitats 
(Murray and Cowie 2011). Buoyant plastics float at the surface, whereas more dense microplastics or those fouled by biota sink to the sea floor. It has recently been estimated that 50 % of the plastics from municipal waste have a higher  density than seawater such that it will readily sink to the seafloor (Engler 2012). 
It is currently not economically feasible nor is it desirable to remove microplastics from the ocean.
A number of concerns have been raised regarding the assessment of microplas-
tic distribution. There are multiple pathways for the introduction of microplastics into the marine environment which do not have accurate timescales for the rate of degradation (Ryan et al. 2009). Quantification is complicated by the size of the oceans in relation to the size of plastics being assessed (Cole et al. 2011), which are further confounded by ocean currents and seasonal patterns introducing spatial and temporal variability (Doyle et al. 2011). As a result, there are various tech-niques applied to the sampling of microplastics in the marine environment (Löder and Gerdts 2015). Results of studies have been reported in different dimensions, e.g. the number of microplastics in a known water volume (particles m
−3) or area 
measurements (particles km−2). This discrepancy presents a problem when com-
paring between studies, as it is not possible to compare results directly. For the purpose of this review, which aims to carry out a critical assessment of the global knowledge of microplastic distribution, a conversion was made to enable compari-sons between the different dimensions of measurement. It is reasonable to assume that surface samples are collected in the top 0.20 m of water and therefore by mak-ing a simple calculation to add a third dimension (firstly converting particle km
−2 
to m−2, then multiplying by 0.20 m to convert to a volume measurement, m−3) we 
are able to compare different sampling methods in a variety of geographical loca-tions. However, because of current directions in relation to boats, and approximate vessel speeds, it is difficult to calculate the amount of water passing through a net. As nets can ride out of the water, the exact volume of water passing through is unknown: the calculations have to be considered, at best, estimations.
It is important to understand the distribution of microplastics in the sea to grasp 
their potential impacts. This section will present a number of studies document-ing microplastics in geographical regions including the Pacific, Atlantic, European Seas and the Mediterranean Sea, Indian Ocean and polar regions. It will introduce modelling strategies that have been utilised to understand microplastic distribution and accumulation around the globe.
10.2.1  Microplastics in the Pacific Ocean
Numerous studies on microplastics have been undertaken in the Pacific Ocean, the world’s largest water basin (Table 10.1). One area which has received considerable attention is the North Pacific Central Gyre (NPCG) located off the west coast of 249

California, USA. The gyre contains possibly the most well publicised area of plas-
tic accumulation, known as the “Great Pacific Garbage Patch” (Kaiser 2010). 
Microplastic concentrations in the NPCG have increased by two orders of magni-tude in the last four decades (Goldstein et al. 2012). In comparison, microplastic abundance in the North Pacific subtropical gyre (NPSG) is widespread and spa-tially variable, but values are two orders of magnitude lower than in the NPCG (Goldstein et al. 2013). Microplastic studies in the south Pacific are limited to the subtropical gyre where an increasing trend of microplastics was found towards the centre of the gyre (5.38 particles m
−3 1 Eriksen et al. 2013). In a similar way to 
macroplastic debris, oceanographic features strongly affect the distribution of microplastics in open oceans and areas of upwelling create oceanographic conver -
gence zones for marine debris.
Coastal ecosystems of the Pacific appear to be impacted by microplastics in 
areas of nutrient upwelling (Doyle et al. 2011) and influenced by local weather systems (Moore et al. 2002; Lattin et al. 2004). Microplastic load increased fur -
ther inshore, reflecting the inputs from terrestrial runoff and particles re-suspended from sediments following storms (Lattin et al. 2004). Microplastics are in turn transported by ocean currents from populated coastal areas (Reisser et al. 2013). This is also reflected in offshore subsurface waters which had 4–27 times less plastics than coastal sites in the northeast Pacific (Desforges et al. 2014).
Pre-production plastic resin pellets and fragments wash up on coastlines world-
wide and have been recovered from several Pacific beaches (Table 10.2). Plastic pellets, typically 3–5 mm in size, are made predominantly from the polymers pol-yethylene and polypropylene (Endo et al. 2005; Ogata et al. 2009). The average

abundance of plastic fragments on beaches in the southeast Pacific was greater 
in isolated areas (Easter Island: >800 items m−2) than on beaches from conti-
nental Chile (30 items m−2) (Hidalgo-Ruz and Thiel 2013). This trend has been 
seen in the Hawaiian archipelago, where the remotest beaches on Midway Atoll and Moloka’I contained the highest quantity of plastic particles (McDermid and McMullen 2004; Corcoran et al. 2009; Cooper and Corcoran 2010).
10.2.2  Microplastics in the Atlantic Ocean
Research on microplastic distribution in the Atlantic is less extensive than in the Pacific (Table 10.3), but includes a number of long-term studies. A time-series conducted in the north Atlantic and Caribbean Sea identified microplastics in 62 % of the trawls conducted with densities reaching 580,000 particles km
−2 (Law et al. 
2010). Distinct patterns emerged with the highest concentration (83 % of plas-tics) in subtropical latitudes, 22°N and 88°N, of the north Atlantic gyre marking the presence of a large-scale convergence zone (Law et al. 2010; Morét-Ferguson et al. 2010) similar to the south Pacific (Eriksen et al. 2013). Converging surface currents driven by winds are assumed to be the driving force of this accumula-tion. To assess long-term trends in abundance, a time-series data set of continu-ous plankton recorder (CPR) samples from north Atlantic shipping routes were re-examined and microplastics were identified from the 1960s with a signifi-cant increase over time (Thompson et al. 2004). Regular sampling schemes have begun to monitor the spatial and temporal trends of microplastics in the northeast Atlantic and found microplastics to be widespread and abundant (Lusher et al. 2014).
Microplastics accumulate in the coastal pelagic zones of the Atlantic 
(Table 10.3). Water samples from the Portuguese coast identified microplas-
tics in 61 % of the samples with higher concentrations found in Costa Vicentina 
and Lisbon (0.036 and 0.033 particles m
−3, respectively) than in the Algarve and 
Aveiro (0.014 and 0.002 particles m−3, respectively). These results are probably 
related to the proximity to urban areas and river runoff (Frias et al. 2014), which is similar to the trend seen in the Pacific. Following a MARMAP cruise in the south Atlantic, microplastic beads were present in 14.6–34.2 % of tows conducted (van Dolah et al. 1980). Pelagic subsurface plankton samples from a geographically isolated archipelago, Saint Peter and Saint Paul, were not free of microplastic frag-ments. Modelling studies suggested that oceanographic mechanisms promote the topographic trapping of zooplankton and therefore microplastics might be retained by small-scale circulation patterns (Ivar do Sul et al. 2013). Additionally, research in the Firth of Clyde (U.K.) indicated that intense environmental sampling regimes are necessary to encompass the small-scale and temporal variation in coastal microplastic abundance (Welden, pers. comm.).
Microplastic granules and pellets have been identified on Atlantic beaches 
since the 1980s (Table 10.4). It was hypothesised that pre-production pellets are 253

10.2.3  Microplastics in European Seas  
and the Mediterranean Sea
Marine litter including microplastic is a serious concern in the Mediterranean, with 
plastics accounting for 70–80 % of litter identified (Fossi et al. 2014). This enclosed water basin is not free of microplastic contamination (Table 10.5). Levels of microplastics in surface waters of the northwest Mediterranean were similar to those reported for the NPCG, (0.27 particles m
−3 2 Collignon et al. 2012), and 
areas far away from point sources of pollution have high microplastic abundance (0.15 particles m
−3; de Lucia et al. 2014). Interestingly, fewer particles were 
recorded from surface waters from coastal Corsica (0.012 particles m−3 3 ; 
Collignon et al. 2014). Microplastic distribution is strongly influenced by wind 
stress, which may redistribute particles in the upper layers of the water column and preclude sampling by surface tows (Collignon et al. 2012). Oceanographic influ-ences may affect the distribution of microplastics in the Mediterranean. Further research will help to clarify if the new hypothesis by de Lucia et al. (2014) holds, which suggests that upwelling dilutes the amount of plastic in the surface waters.
Microplastics, including beads and pellets, have been widely reported for sedimen-
tary habitats and beaches in European Seas and the Mediterranean Sea (Table 10.6). 
Microplastics have been extracted from sediments from Norderney, in the North Sea (Dekiff et al. 2014; Fries et al. 2013) and samples taken at the East Frisian

Islands, where tidal flats were more contaminated than sandy beaches (Liebezeit and 
Dubaish 2012). Areas of low hydrodynamics appear to have high microplastic abun-
dance, such as the Venice lagoon (Vianello et al. 2013). Reduced water movement could also be attributed to the difference between concentrations of microplastics in Belgium: higher concentrations of microplastics were identified in sediments from Belgium harbors (Claessens et al. 2011) than in beach samples (Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013a). Lastly, microplastics were recorded in deep offshore sediments (Van 
Cauwenberghe et al. 2013b; Fischer et al. 2015), which shows that microplastics sink 
to the deep seafloor. In fact, the deep seafloor may be considered a major sink for microplastic debris (Woodall et al. 2014) and explain the current mismatch between estimated global inputs of plastic debris to the oceans (Jambeck et al. 2015) and field data (Cózar et al. 2014; Eriksen et al. 2014), which refer largely to floating litter.
10.2.4  Microplastics in the Indian Ocean and Marginal Seas
To date there are few large-scale reports on microplastics from the Indian Ocean. Reddy et al. (2006) reported microplastic fragments from a ship-breaking yard in the Arabian Sea, and microplastics accounted for 20 % of the plastics recorded on sandy beaches in Mumbai (Jayasiri et al. 2013). Pellets were also recorded on

Malaysian beaches (Ismail et al. 2009). Most of the studies shown in Table 10.7 
are part of the “International Pellet Watch” (Takada 2006; Ogata et al. 2009). 
Shoreline surveys conducted in surface waters and sediments on Singapore’s coasts identified microplastics >2 µm (Ng and Obbard 2006). This highlights an area that requires further investigation to obtain a wider picture of microplastic distribution around the globe.
10.2.5  Microplastics in Polar Regions
Prior to 2014, there had been no direct studies of microplastics in either the Arctic or Antarctica; the plastic flux into the Arctic Ocean has been calculated to range between 62,000 and 105,000 tons per year, with variation due to spatial heterogene-
ity, temporal variability and different sampling methods (Zarfl and Matthies 2010). With the estimated value four to six orders of magnitude below the atmospheric transport and ocean current fluxes, the study concluded that plastic transport levels to the Arctic are negligible and that plastics are not a likely vector for organic pol-lutants to the Arctic. However, Obbard et al. (2014) published results from ice cores collected from remote locations in the Arctic Ocean. The levels of microplastics observed (range: 38–234 particles m
−3) were two orders of magnitude greater than 
previously reported in the Pacific gyre (Goldstein et al. 2012). Macroplastics have been identified floating in surface waters of Antarctica. However, trawls for micro-plastics did not catch any particles (Barnes et al. 2010). Dietary studies of birds from 
the Canadian Arctic have reported ingested plastics (Mallory et al. 2006; Provencher et al. 2009, 2010), and macroplastics were observed on the deep Arctic seafloor 
(Bergmann and Klages 2012). This indirect evidence suggests that microplastics have already entered polar regions. A modelling study even suggests the presence or formation of a sixth garbage patch in the Barents Sea (van Sebille et al. 2012).
10.2.6  Modelling the Distribution of Microplastics
Studies have highlighted the interaction of oceanographic and environmental variables on the distribution of microplastics (e.g. Eriksen et al. 2013). As poly-mer densities affect the distribution of plastics in the water column, it is impor -
tant to understand how microplastics are transported at the surface and at depths. Knowledge of point-source pollution, including riverine input and sewage drain-age into marine and coastal environments, can be useful in understanding the extent to which certain ecosystems are affected. Furthermore, knowledge of plastic accumulation on beaches will benefit the study of microplastics. For example, a study of plastic litter washed onto beaches developed a particle tracking model, which indicated that, if levels of plastic outflow remain constant over the com-ing decade, plastic litter quantity on beaches would continue to increase, and in some cases (3 % of all east Asian beaches) could see a 250-fold increase in plastic 260 A. Lusher
litter (Kako et al. 2014). If not removed, these larger items of plastic litter will 
break down into microplastics over time.
The fate of plastics in the marine environment is affected by poorly understood 
geophysical processes, including ocean mixing of the sea-surface boundary layer, re-suspension from sediments, and sinking rates plastics denser than seawater. Modelling approaches are required to further understand, and accurately estimate the global distribution, residence time, convergence zones, and ecological conse-quences of microplastics (Ballent et al. 2013). Models predicting the breakdown, 
fragmentation, and subsequent mixing and re-suspension of microplastics in sedi-ments and seawater could provide an estimation of microplastic accumulation over short and long time scales; as well as an estimation of the dispersal patterns of microplastics in the marine environment. Generalized linear models have indicated that oceanographic mechanisms may promote topographic trapping of zooplank-ton and microplastics, which may be retained by small-scale circulation patterns in the Equatorial Atlantic, suggesting there is an outward gradient of microplastics moving offshore (Ivar do Sul et al. 2013). The recovery of plastic from surface seawater is dependent on wind speeds: stronger winds resulted in the capture of fewer plastics because wind-induced mixing of the surface layer vertically distrib-utes plastics (Kulkula et al. 2012). Furthermore, by integrating the effect of verti-
cal wind mixing on the concentrations of plastics in Australian waters, researchers estimated depth-integrated plastic concentrations, with high concentrations expected at low wind speeds. Thus, with the inverse relationship between wind force and plastic concentration, net tow concentrations of microplastics increased by a factor of 2.8 (Reisser et al. 2013).
Ballent et al. (2013) used the MOHID modelling system to predict the disper -
sal of non-buoyant pellets in Portugal using their density, settling velocity and re-suspension characteristics. Researchers simulated the transport of microplastic pellets over time using oceanographic processes, scales and systems. Model pre-dictions suggest that the bottom topography restricts pellet movement at the head of the Nazaré Canyon with a potential area of accumulation of plastics pellets on the seafloor, implying long-term exposure of benthic ecosystems to microplastics. Tidal forces, as well as large-scale oceanographic circulation patterns are likely to transport microplastics up and down the Nazaré Canyon, which may be greatly increased during mass transport of waters linked to storms (Ballent et al. 2013) or deep-water cascading events (Durrieu de Madron et al. 2013).
With residence times from decades to centuries predicted for microplastics in the 
benthic environment (Ballent et al. 2013), future studies should assess the degrada-
tion of microplastics on the seafloor to be able to estimate residence times in those potential sink environments. Coupled with observations of microplastics in surface waters, the total oceanic plastic concentrations might be underestimated because of limited but growing knowledge of the geophysical and oceanographic processes in the surface waters. Furthermore, as microplastics degrade towards a nanome-tre scale, transport properties may be affected, and as a result, long-term transport models will need to be corrected. Modelling should be adapted to bring in ecologi-cal consequences of microplastics in benthic environments and the water column.  261

Research should focus on critical areas such as biodiversity hotspots and 
socio-economic hotspots that could affect vulnerable marine biota and coastal communities.
10.2.7  Summary
Microplastics have been documented in almost every habitat of the open oceans and enclosed seas, including beaches, surface waters, water column and the deep seafloor. Although most water bodies have been investigated, there is a lack of published work from polar regions and the Indian Ocean. Further research is required to accurately estimate the amount of different types of microplastics in benthic environments around the globe. Distribution of microplastics depends on environmental conditions including ocean currents, horizontal and vertical mixing, wind mixing and biofilm formation, as well as the properties of individual plastic polymers. A number of modelling approaches have been considered in the recent literature, which highlighted the effect of wind on the distribution of microplastics in the ocean. Oceanographic modelling of floating debris has shown accumula-tion in ocean gyres, and the distribution of microplastics within the water column appears to be dependent on the composition, density and shape of plastic poly-mers affecting their buoyancy. Further modelling studies may help to identify and predict regions with ecological communities and fisheries more vulnerable to the potential consequences of plastic contamination. The distribution of microplas-tic plays a significant role in terms of which organisms and habitats are affected. Widespread accumulation and distribution of microplastics raises concerns regard-ing the interaction and potential effects on marine organisms.
10.3  Interactions of Microplastics with Marine Organisms
Recently, Wright et al. (2013a) discussed the biological factors, which could 
enhance microplastic bioavailability to marine organisms: the varying density of microplastics allows them to occupy different areas of the water column and ben-thic sediments. As microplastics interact with plankton and sediment particles, both suspension and deposit feeders may be at risk of accidentally or selectively ingest-ing marine debris. However, the relative impacts are likely to vary across the size spectrum of microplastic in relation to the organisms affected, which is depend-ent on the size of the microplastic particles encountered. Microplastics in the upper end of the size spectrum (1–5 mm) may compromise feeding and digestion. For example, Codina-García et al. (2013) isolated such pellets and fragments from the stomachs of seabirds. Particles <20 µm are actively ingested by small inverte-brates (e.g. Thompson et al. 2004) but they are also egested (e.g. Lee et al. 2013). 
Studies have shown that nanoparticles can translocate (e.g. Wegner et al. 2012)  262 A. Lusher
and model simulations have indicated that nano-sized polystyrene (PS) particles 
may permeate into the lipid membranes of organisms, altering the membrane struc-ture, membrane protein activity, and therefore cellular function (Rossi et al. 2013). The following section deals with incidences of ingestion, trophic transfer and pro-vision of new habitat by the presence of microplastics in the marine environment. Although the sections contain examples, comprehensive lists of microplastics ingestion are included in the corresponding tables.
10.3.1  Ingestion
Ingestion is the most likely interaction between marine organisms and microplas-tics. Microplastics’ small size gives them the potential to be ingested by a wide range of biota in benthic and pelagic ecosystems. In some cases, organisms feed-ing mechanisms do not allow for discrimination between prey and anthropogenic items (Moore et al. 2001). Secondly, organisms might feed directly on micro-plastics, mistaking them for prey or selectively feed on microplastics in place of food (Moore 2008). If there is a predominance of microplastic particles associated with planktonic prey items, organisms could be unable to differentiate or prevent ingestion. A number of studies have reported microplastics from the stomachs and intestines of marine organisms, including fish and invertebrates. Watts et al. (2014) showed that shore crabs (Carcinus maenas) will not only ingest microplastics along with food (evidence in the foregut) but also draw plastics into the gill cav-ity because of their ventilation mechanism: this highlights that it is important to consider all sorts of routes of exposure to microplastics. If organisms ingest micro-plastics they could have adverse effects on individuals by disrupting feeding and digestion (GESAMP 2010). Laboratory (Table 10.8) and field (Table 10.9) studies highlighted that microplastics are mistaken for food by a wide variety of animals including birds, fish, turtles, mammals and invertebrates. Despite concerns raised regarding microplastic ingestion, few studies specifically examined the occurrence of microplastic in natural, in situ, populations as it is methodologically challeng-ing to assess microplastic ingestion in the field (Browne et al. 2008).
10.3.1.1  Planktonic Invertebrates
Microplastics can enter the very base of the marine food web via absorption. 
Such was observed when charged nano-polystyrene beads were absorbed into the cellulose of a marine alga (Scenedesmus spp.), which inhibited photosynthe-sis and caused oxidative stress (Bhattacharya et al. 2010). Microplastics can also affect the function and health of marine zooplankton (Cole et al. 2013; Lee et al. 
2013). Decreased feeding was observed following ingestion of polystyrene beads by zooplankton (Cole et al. 2013). Furthermore, adult females and nauplius lar -
vae of the copepod (Tigriopus japonicus) survived acute exposure, but increased 263

mortality rates were observed following a two-generation chronic toxicity test 
(12.5 µg mL−1) (Lee et al. 2013). Although a third of gooseneck barnacle (Lepas 
spp.) stomachs examined contained microplastics, no adverse effect was reported for these filter feeders (Goldstein and Goodwin 2013). Interestingly, the stom-achs of mass stranded Humboldt squids (Dosidicus gigas) contained plastic pel-lets (Braid et al. 2012). This large predatory cephalopod usually feeds at depth 
between 200 and 700 m. The route of uptake is unclear; the squid may have fed directly on sunken pellets, or on organisms with pellets in their digestive system.
10.3.1.2  Benthic Invertebrates
A number of benthic invertebrates have been studied under laboratory conditions 
to investigate the consequences of microplastic ingestion (Table 10.8). Laboratory feeding and retention trials have focused on direct exposure of invertebrates to microplastic particles (as summarised by Cole et al. 2011; Wright et al. 2013a). Exposure studies demonstrated that benthic invertebrates including lugworms (Arenicola marina), amphipods (Orchestia gammarellus) and blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) feed directly on microplastics (Thompson et al. 2004; Wegner et al. 2012), and deposit-feeding sea cucumbers even selectively ingested micro-plastic particles (Graham and Thompson 2009).
Although microplastic uptake was recorded for a number of species, organ-
isms appear to reject microplastics before digestion and excrete microplastics after digestion. Pseudofaeces production is a form of rejection before diges-tion but requires additional energetic cost. Furthermore, prolonged pseudofae-ces production could lead to starvation (Wegner et al. 2012). On the other hand, polychaete worms, sea cucumbers and sea urchins are able to excrete unwanted materials through their intestinal tract without suffering obvious harm (Thompson et al. 2004; Graham and Thompson 2009; Kaposi et al. 2014). Adverse effects of microplastic ingestion were reported for lugworms: weight loss was positively correlated with concentration of spiked sediments (40–1300 µm polystyrene) (Besseling et al. 2013). Similarly, Wright et al. (2013b) recorded significantly reduced feeding activity and significantly decreased energy reserves in lugworm exposed to 5 % un-plasticised polyvinyl chloride (U-PVC). Supressed feeding 
reduced energy assimilation, compromising fitness. At the chronic exposure level, either fewer particles were ingested overall or a lack of protein coating on the U-PVC may have weakened particle adhesion to the worm's feeding apparatus.
Several studies have raised concern for microplastic retention and transfer -
ence between organisms’ tissues. For example, microplastics were retained in the digestive tract of mussels, and transferred to the haemolymph system after three days (Browne et al. 2008). However, negative effects on individuals were not detected. V on Moos et al. (2012) tracked particles of high density polyethyl-
ene (HDPE) into the lysosomal system of mussels after three hours of exposure; particles were taken up by the gills and transferred to the digestive tract and lyso-somal system, again triggering an inflammatory immune response. It should be 276 A. Lusher
noted, however, that while these studies succeeded in determining the pathways 
of microplastics in organisms the exposure concentrations used to achieve this goal exceeded those expected in the field, such that the results have to be treated with care.
Studies of microplastic ingestion by benthic invertebrates in the field are less 
common than laboratory studies. Murray and Cowie (2011) identified fibres of monofilament plastics that could be sourced to fibres of trawls and fragments of plastic bags in the intestines of the commercially valuable Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus). These results indicated that normal digestive processes do not eliminate some of the filaments as they cannot pass through the gastric mill system. Norway lobsters have various feeding modes, including scavenging and predation, and are not adapted to cut flexible filamentous materials (Murray and Cowie 2011). The identification of microplastics in organisms that are caught for 
commercial purposes and subsequently consumed whole (including guts) high-lights the potential human health implications. For example, field-caught brown shrimps (Crangon crangon) (Pott 2014) and farmed and store-brought bivalves 
(De Witte et al. 2014; Van Cauwenberghe and Janssen 2014) had microplastics in their digestive system.
Invertebrates could be used as indicator species for environmental contamina-
tion. Species such as Nephrops are able to integrate seasonal variation in micro-plastic abundance, providing an accurate measure of environmental contamination (Welden, pers. comm.). Additional studies are required to understand the flux of 
microplastic within benthic sediments and the interaction between different spe-cies of benthic infauna feeding in/or manipulating the sediment, such as bivalves and worms. Benthic infauna could ingest and/or excrete microplastics, the individ-uals or their faecal pellets may in turn be ingested by secondary consumers, thus affecting higher trophic levels.
10.3.1.3  Fish
Some of the earliest studies noting ingestion of microplastics by wild-caught fish 
include coastal species from the USA (Carpenter et al. 1972) and the U.K. (Kartar et al. 1973, 1976). More recent studies from the NPCG reported microplastic 
(fibres, fragments and films) ingestion by mesopelagic fish (Boerger et al. 2010; Davison and Asch 2011; Choy and Drazen 2013). Estuarine environments and 
their inhabitants are also prone to plastic contamination, which is hardly surprising given the riverine input (e.g. Morritt et al. 2014). Estuarine fish affected include catfish, Ariidae, (23 % of individuals examined) and estuarine drums, Scianenidae, (7.9 % of individuals examined), which spend their entire life cycle in estuaries (Possatto et al. 2011; Dantas et al. 2012). Similarly, 13.4 % of bottom-feeding fish (Gerreidae) from a tropical estuary in northeast Brazil contained microplastics in their stomachs (Ramos et al. 2012). The authors suggested that ingestion occurred during suction feeding on biofilms.277
10 Microplastics in the Marine Environment …
Lusher et al. (2013) reported microplastic polymers from 10 fish species from 
the English Channel. Of the 504 fish examined, 37 % had ingested a variety of 
microplastics, the most common being polyamide and the semi-synthetic material rayon. Similarly, Boerger et al. (2010) recorded microplastics in 35 % planktivo-rous fish examined from the NPCG (94 % of which were plastic fragments). Fish from the northern North Sea ingested microplastics at significantly lower levels (1.2 %) compared to those from the southern North Sea (5.4 %) (Foekema et al. 
2013). All the studies cited suggest direct ingestion as the prime route of exposure, either targeted as food or mistaken for prey items. No adverse effects of ingestion were reported. Consequently, studies are required to follow the route of microplas-tic ingestion in fish, to assess if microplastics are egested in faecal pellets as seen in invertebrates. Dos Santos and Jobling (1992) showed that microplastic beads (2 mm) were excreted quickly following ingestion, whereas larger beads (5 mm) were held for prolonged periods of time. This implies that larger items of plastic might pose a greater risk following ingestion whereas smaller microplastics are likely to be excreted along with natural faeces.
10.3.1.4  Sea Birds
Numerous studies have dealt with the ingestion of marine debris by sea birds (see 
Kühn et al. 2015). Microplastics and small plastic items have been isolated from birds targeted deliberately for dietary studies, dead cadavers, regurgitated samples and faeces (Table 10.10). Nearly 50 species of Procellariiformes (fulmars, petrels, shearwaters, albatrosses), known to feed opportunistically at the sea surface had microplastics in their stomachs. Ingested microplastics appeared to comprise pri-marily of pellets and user-fragments (Ryan 1987; Robards et al. 1995) although there was a decrease in the proportion of pellets ingested by birds from the south Atlantic between the 1980s and 2006 (Ryan 2008). This trend is also true for short-tailed shearwater (Puffinus tenuirostris) from the North Sea (Vlietstra and Parga 2002). In this case however, the mass of industrial plastics (pellets) have decreased by half and the mass of plastic fragments has tripled (van Franeker et al. 2011). It is possible that the shift in the type of plastic consumed may be explained by fragmentation of larger user-plastics into smaller microplastics, the accumulation of user-plastic over time and a decreased disposal of industrial plastics (Thompson et al. 2004), or simply by a stronger awareness of the presence of microplastics.
Seabirds appear to be able to remove microplastics from their digestive tracts 
as regurgitation has been observed in the boluses of glaucous-winged gulls (Larus glaucescens) (Lindborg et al. 2012). However, this suggests that parents expose their offspring to plastics during feeding. Juveniles of northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) had more plastic in their intestines than adults (Kühn and van Franeker 2012), with higher quantities in areas of higher fishing and shipping traffic (van Franeker et al. 2011). Still, as the majority of birds examined did not die as a direct result of microplastic uptake, it can be concluded that microplastic ingestion 278 A. Lusher
does not affect seabirds as severely as macroplastic ingestion. To date, there have 
been no studies demonstrating nanometre-sized microplastics in sea birds. This could be because it is extremely difficult to control laboratory conditions in terms of contamination.
10.3.1.5  Marine Mammals
Only one study on microplastic ingestion by marine mammals has been published 
to date. Bravo Rebolledo et al. (2013) recorded microplastics in stomachs (11 %, n = 100) and intestines (1 %, n = 107) of harbour seals (Phoca vitulina). Direct 
microplastic ingestion by other species of marine mammals has not been observed. However, larger plastics items were identified in the stomachs of numerous ceta-ceans (46 % of all species; Baulch and Perry 2014, see also Kühn et al. 2015). The frequency of microplastic uptake by marine mammals is hitherto unknown, but could occur through filter feeding, inhalation at the water-air interface, or via trophic transfer from prey items. As baleen whales (Mysticetes) strain water between baleen plates, to trap planktonic organisms and small fish (Nemoto 1970), they may incidentally trap microplastics. Thus, their feeding mode may ren-der baleen whales more susceptible to direct microplastic ingestion than toothed (Odotocetes) or beaked whales (Ziphiids) which are active predators of squid and fish (Pauly et al. 1998). It is also likely that marine mammals are exposed to microplastic via trophic transfer from prey species. For example, microplastics were recorded from the scats of fur seals (Arctocephalus spp.) believed to origi-nate from lantern fish (Electrona subaspera) (Eriksson and Burton 2003).
Cetaceans were suggested as sentinels for microplastic pollution (Fossi et al. 
2012a; Galgani et al. 2014). However, it is notoriously difficult to extract and sub-sequently assess microplastics from cetacean stomachs, the often large size and decomposition rate of stomachs make sampling almost impossible. Furthermore, strandings are infrequent and unpredictable. Although adaption of sampling meth-ods for smaller organisms such as fish and birds have the potential to be imple-mented, further work is necessary. The assessment of phthalate concentrations in the blubber of stranded fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) (Fossi et al. 2012b, 2014) could serve as an indicator for the uptake of microplastics, but this raises other concerns as it is not possible to distinguish the origin of the phthalates. Exposure routes could be via micro- or macroplastics or simply from direct uptake of chemicals from the surrounding seawater into the blubber. Further work is essential to assess if microplastics significantly affect marine mammals.
10.3.1.6  Sea Turtles
Although all species of marine turtle ingest macroplastics (Derraik 2002; Schuyler 
et al. 2014; Kühn et al. 2015), only one study reported plastic pellets in the stom-
achs of the herbivorous green turtles (Chelonia mydas) (Tourinho et al. 2010).  279

10 Microplastics in the Marine Environment …
It is highly likely that other species of sea turtle also ingest microplastics 
 incidentally or directly, depending on their feeding habits (Schuyler et al. 2014). 
Neonatal and oceanic post-hatchlings are generalist feeders (Bjorndal 1997), targeting plankton from surface waters and microplastic uptake may occur. Trophic transfer from prey items could be a pathway to larger individuals; log-gerhead (Caretta caretta) and Kemp’s Ridley (Lepidochelys kempii) turtles are carnivores, feeding on crustaceans and bivalves (Bjorndal 1997), which ingest microplastics (e.g. Browne et al. 2008). Flatbacks (Natator depressa) are also carnivores but feed on soft bodied invertebrates (Bjorndal 1997), including sea cucumbers, which again, ingest microplastics (Graham and Thompson 2009). Leatherbacks (Dermochelys coriacea) feed on gelatinous organisms (Bjorndal 1997) and are thus more likely to ingest macroplastics because of their size and similarity to prey items. If microplastics are ingested they could affect sea turtle growth and development if they are not egested. Additional work is required to understand whether turtles actively ingest microplastics, and if so, the extent of the harm caused.
10.3.2  Trophic Transfer
Absorption and ingestion of microplastics by organisms from the primary trophic level, e.g. phytoplankton and zooplankton, could be a pathway into the food chain (Bhattacharya et al. 2010). Many species of zooplankton undergo a diur -
nal migration. Migrating zooplankton could be considered a vector of micro-plastic contamination to greater depths of the water column and its inhabitants, either through predation or the production of faecal pellets sinking to the seafloor (Wright et al. 2013a). Only a few studies deal with the potential for microplas-
tics to be transferred between trophic levels following ingestion. Field observation highlighted the presence of microplastics in the scat of fur seals (Arctocephalus spp.) and Eriksson and Burton (2003) suggested that microplastics had initially been ingested by the fur seals’ prey, the plankton feeding Mycophiids. In feed-ing experiments, Farrell and Nelson (2013) identified microplastic in the gut and haemolymph of the shore crab (Carcinus maenas), which had previously been ingested by blue mussels (Mytilus edulis). There was large variability in the num-ber of microspheres in tissues samples, and the results have to be treated with cau-tion as the number of individuals was low and the exposure levels used exceeded those from the field. Similarly, Nephrops-fed fish, which had been seeded with microplastic strands of polypropylene rope were found to ingest but not to excrete the strands (Murray and Cowie 2011), again implying potential trophic transfer. As mentioned above, microplastics were also detected in cod, whiting, haddock, bivalves and brown shrimp, which are consumed by humans and raises concerns about trophic transfer to humans and human exposure (see Galloway 2015). Further studies are required to increase our understanding of trophic transfer.292 A. Lusher
10.3.3  Microplastic Effect on Habitats
Surfaces of buoyant microplastics provide habitats for rafting organisms. For 
example, pelagic insects (Halobates micans and H. sericeus) utilize microplastic pellets for oviposition (Goldstein et al. 2012; Majer et al. 2012). Indeed, Goldstein et al. (2012) attributed an overall increase in H. sericeus and egg densities in the NPCG to high concentrations of microplastics. Likewise, plastics serve as a float-ing habitat for bacterial colonisation (Lobelle and Cunliffe 2011). Microorganisms including Bacillus bacteria (mean: 1664 ± 247 individuals mm
−2) and pennate 
diatoms (mean: 1097 ± 154 individuals mm−2) were identified on plastic items 
from the North Pacific gyre (Carson et al. 2013). These studies suggest that micro-
plastics affect the distribution and dispersal of marine organisms and may repre-sent vectors to alien invasion. Plastics colonised by pathogenic viruses or bacteria may spread the potential for disease, but there is currently no evidence to support this hypothesis.
Microplastic buried in sediments could have fundamental impacts on marine 
biota as they increase the permeability of sediment and decrease thermal diffusiv-ity (Carson et al. 2011). This may affect temperature-dependent processes. For example, altered temperatures during incubation can bias the sex ratios of sea tur -
tle eggs. At 30 °C, equal numbers of males and female embryos develop, whereas at temperatures <28 °C all embryos become male (Yntema and Mrosovsky 1982). With microplastics in sediments it will take longer to reach maximum tempera-tures because of its increased permeability. Therefore, eggs may require a longer incubation period, with more male hatchlings because of the insulating effect. Microplastic concentrations as low as 1.5 can decrease maximum temperatures by 0.75 °C (Carson et al. 2011), which has important implications for sexual bias in sea turtles including loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) and hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) (Yntema and Mrosovsky 1982; Mrosovsky et al. 1992). Changes in the sediment temperatures could also affect infaunal organisms as it may affect enzymatic and other physiological processes, feeding and growth rates, locomotory speeds, reproduction and ultimately population dynamics. However, this remains speculative until further researched.
10.3.4  Summary
Microplastic ingestion has been documented for a range of marine vertebrates and invertebrates (Fig. 10.1). Interactions were recorded primarily during controlled laboratory studies, but results from field sampling of wild populations also indicate microplastic ingestion. In the case of some invertebrates, adverse physiological and biological effects were reported. The biological repercussions depend on to the size of microplastics with smaller sizes having greater effects on organisms at the cellu-lar level. In the micrometre range, plastics are readily ingested and egested whereas 293
10 Microplastics in the Marine Environment …
nanometre-sized plastics can pass through cell membranes. Acute exposure experi-
ments demonstrated significant biological effects including weight loss, reduced feeding activity, increased phagocytic activity and transference to the lysosomal (storage) system. Larger microplastics (2–5 mm) may take longer to pass from the

stomachs of organisms and could be retained in the digestive system, potentially 
increasing the exposure time to adsorbed toxins (see Rochman 2015).
It is important to determine the ecological effects of microplastic ingestion. 
Studies are required to assess the contamination of more species of fish, marine mammals and sea turtles, as well as consequences of microplastic uptake and retention. Further research is necessary to determine the limits of microplastic translocation between tissues, and assess the differences between multiple pol-ymer types and shapes. It is likely that additional species of invertebrate ingest microplastics in wild populations, as fibres and fragments found in the field are actively selected in experiments. Although some organisms appear to be able to differentiate between microplastics and prey, and microplastic excretion has been recorded. Without knowledge of retention and egestion rates of field populations, it is difficult to deduce ecological consequences. There is some evidence to sug-gest that microplastics enter the food chain and transfer of microplastics between trophic levels implies bioaccumulation and biomagnification. Despite concerns raised by ingestion in the marine environment, the effects of microplastic inges-tion in natural populations and the implications for food webs are not understood. Such knowledge is crucial in order to be able to develop and implement effective management strategies (Thompson et al. 2009). Additional studies are required to understand the flux of microplastic from benthic sediments to the infauna. Lastly, microplastics provide open ocean habitats for colonisation by invertebrates, bac-teria and viruses. As a result, these organisms can be transported over large dis-tances by ocean currents and/or through the water column (Kiessling et al. 2015).
10.4  Conclusion
Microplastics have been found in almost every marine habitat around the world, and plastic density along with ocean currents appears to have a significant effect on their distribution. Modelling studies suggest that floating debris accumulates in ocean gyres but this is dependent on the composition and shape of individual polymers. The widespread distribution and accumulation of microplastics raises concerns regarding the interaction and potential effects of microplastics on marine organisms. As microplastics interact with plankton and sediments, both suspen-sion and deposit feeders may accidentally or selectively ingest microplastics. Despite concerns regarding ingestion, only a limited number of studies examined microplastic ingestion in the field. Knowledge of the retention rates of microplas-tics would enable estimations of the impacts of microplastic uptake. If rejection occurs before digestion, microplastics might pose less of a threat to organisms than initially assumed. However, there could be energetic costs associated with the production of pseudofaeces. Laboratory studies can be used to determine the end point of microplastic ingestion, and would benefit from using multiple types of microplastics to simulate field conditions. Unfortunately, it is difficult to establish a direct link between microplastics and adverse effects on marine biota 295

experimentally. Furthermore, due to the difficult nature of field studies, it will be 
harder to understand effects on natural populations.
As microplastic research is still in its infancy, there are many more unanswered 
questions, the answers to which are required to build on current knowledge to develop a clearer picture of the impact of microplastics in the sea.

Modeling the Role of Microplastics  
in Bioaccumulation of Organic Chemicals to Marine Aquatic Organisms. A Critical Review
Albert A. Koelmans
© The Author(s) 2015 
M. Bergmann et al. (eds.), Marine Anthropogenic Litter,  DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-16510-3_11Abstract It has been shown that ingestion of microplastics may increase bioaccu-
mulation of organic chemicals by aquatic organisms. This paper critically reviews 
the literature on the effects of plastic ingestion on the bioaccumulation of organic chemicals, emphasizing quantitative approaches and mechanistic models. It appears that the role of microplastics can be understood from chemical partitioning to micro-plastics and subsequent bioaccumulation by biota, with microplastic as a  component 
of the organisms’ diet. Microplastic ingestion may either clean or contaminate the organism, depending on the chemical fugacity gradient between ingested  plastic 
and organism tissue. To date, most laboratory studies used clean test organisms exposed to contaminated microplastic, thus favouring chemical transfer to the  organism. Observed effects on bioaccumulation were either insignificant or less 
than a factor of two to three. In the field, where contaminants are present already,  gradients can be expected to be smaller or even opposite, leading to cleaning by 
plastic. Furthermore, the directions of the gradients may be opposite for the  different 
 chemicals present in the chemical mixtures in microplastics and in the  environment. 
This implies a continuous trade-off between slightly increased contamination and 
cleaning upon ingestion of microplastic, a trade-off that probably attenuates the overall hazard of microplastic ingestion. Simulation models have shown to be help-ful in mechanistically analysing these observations and scenarios, and are discussed in detail. Still, the literature on parameterising such models is limited and further experimental work is required to better constrain the parameters in these models for the wide range of organisms and chemicals acting in the aquatic environment. Gaps in knowledge and recommendations for further research are provided.

11.1  Introduction
Pollution with plastic debris and microplastic fragments has been recognized 
as a major problem in fresh water and marine systems (Derraik 2002; Andrady 2011; Koelmans et al. 2014a). Negative effects may relate to entanglement in plastic wires or nets, or to ingestion, which has been reported for benthic inver -
tebrates, birds, fish, mammals and turtles. Extensive overviews of the deleterious effects of litter on marine life are provided by Kühn et al. (2015) and by Lusher (2015). Furthermore, it is generally assumed that microplastic may act as a vec-tor for transport of chemicals associated with the plastic particles, such as persis-tent organic pollutants (POPs) or additives, residual monomers or oligomers of the component molecules of the plastics (hereafter referred to as ‘additives’) (Gouin et al. 2011; Teuten et al. 2007, 2009; Hammer et al. 2012; Browne et al. 2013; 
Rochman 2015; Lusher 2015). Hydrophobic chemicals including polychlorobiphe-nyls (PCB), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) or polybrominated diethyl ethers (PBDEs), are known to concentrate in polymers such as polyvinylchloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS) or polyoxymethylene (POM), which is the basis of using the latter materials in passive sampling devices (e.g. Hale et al. 2010). Microplastic particles present in seas and oceans have been found to contain considerable quantities of these chemicals (e.g. Ogata et al. 2009; Hirai et al. 2011). Concentrations of additives such as nonylphenol (NP), bisphenol A (BPA), PBDEs and phthalates also have been reported to be high in marine plas-tics, rendering them a potential source to the environment and marine biota. The question whether microplastic-mediated chemical transfer poses a serious actual hazard, however, depends on several other factors. First, for transport of the chem-icals from plastic to an organism, a gradient that drives the chemical from  plastic 
to the organism is required (Gouin et al. 2011; Koelmans et al. 2013a, b). If, how-
ever, a reverse gradient existed, ingestion would lead to cleaning of the organ-ism and ingestion would in this sense be beneficial. Second, the chemical uptake through ingestion of plastic should be substantial compared to other exposure pathways, i.e. by food ingestion or uptake from ambient water. Because POPs as well as additives are ubiquitous in many environments, a dominant role of plastic ingestion is not self-evident (Koelmans et al. 2014b). Third, the chemical hazard of microplastic ingestion should relate to all the chemicals in the plastic-organism system, that is, the chemical mixture transferred to or from the organism by inges-tion and chemicals should not be considered in isolation. A plastic additive may leach from a heavily contaminated plastic particle, but clean the organism from its body burden of legacy POPs at the same time. This means that there may be a trade-off between positive and negative effects of microplastic ingestion.311 11 Modeling the Role of Microplastics in Bioaccumulation …
To date, a few controlled experimental studies have been published confirm-
ing transfer of chemicals from microplastic to marine organisms. Besseling 
et al. (2013) mimicked natural conditions by exposing relatively clean worms to mixtures of a natural marine sediment and PS microplastic, which were pre-equilibrated with PCBs, thus providing realistic exposure conditions. The pres-ence of microplastic caused a small (factor of three) increase in bioaccumulation. However, bioaccumulation decreased again at higher concentrations. The authors argued that PS may not have caused PCB transfer but that the increased bioac-cumulation probably had a biological cause, such as a change in lipid content or feeding rates. Browne et al. (2013) did not use natural sediment but exposed clean lug worms (Arenicola marina) to sand with 5 % of PVC microplastic that was presorbed with high concentrations of nonylphenol, phenanthrene, triclosan and/or PBDE-47. Because by using clean worms, a gradient from the PVC to the organism was created, chemical transfer from the particles to the worms occurred, but uptake from sand was larger than that from the PVC microplastic. Rochman et al. (2013b) exposed fish (Japanese medaka; Oryzias latipes) to contaminated food, to contaminated food mixed with 10 % virgin low density PE (LDPE) and to contaminated food mixed with LDPE that was pre-equilibrated in seawater. They observed an increase in body burdens up to a factor of 2.4 after two months, which was statistically significant for chrysene, PCB28 and most PBDEs. Chua et al. (2014) observed that adding PBDE-spiked microplastics to seawater with amphipods (Allorchestes compressa) in closed vials resulted in PBDE uptake by the amphipods, which was however only statistically significant compared to the controls when spiked concentrations were ten times higher than environmentally relevant concentrations. Addition of clean plastic to the same closed systems yet pre-contaminated with PBDEs resulted in a decreased uptake.
Considering the complex processes involved, modelling approaches have been 
proven useful for the interpretation of experimental data as well as for prognos-tic assessments of the possible hazards caused by plastic ingestion. Model-based scenario studies have helped to define in which cases plastic ingestion may be relevant, dependent on plastic type, chemical properties and species traits. The aim of this chapter is to present and critically discuss the model approaches used to quantify the effect of plastic on bioaccumulation of POPs and additives. This includes a mathematical description of the processes at play, a review of the model-based inferences described in the literature, and an outlook to future work and recommendations.
11.2  Models to Assess the Importance of Microplastic 
Ingestion
In the literature several processes have been identified as important to address 
when modelling effects of microplastic on the bioaccumulation of chemicals. These studies typically consider biota lipids as the target tissue for chemical 312 A.A. Koelmans
accumulation. First of all, plastic has been reported to act as an additional sorb-
ent for POPs and additives (Andrady 2011). Upon addition of clean plastic in any closed system, chemicals will bind to the plastic thus lowering the chemical concentration in other media or compartments present, such as water, sediment and biota (Teuten et al. 2007, 2009; Gouin et al. 2011; Koelmans et al. 2013a; 
Chua et al. 2014). This mechanism of repartitioning thus causes a decrease in exposure of aquatic organisms to chemicals in water, sediment organic matter and food. Conversely, if the plastic carries high enough concentrations of chemi-cals to act as a source, these chemicals will be released and redistribute among the various media present, possibly increasing the chemical concentrations in the other compartments, including biota (Hammer et al. 2012; Koelmans et al. 2014b). Consequently, whether plastic acts as a source or a sink depends on the gradient between the chemical concentration in the plastic and the ambient water. Second, plastic items may slowly disintegrate and degrade under the influence of turbulence and UV radiation or by microbial activity (Andrady 2011, 2015). This 
means that the chemical mass held by the plastic being degraded will be released, even if no a priori gradient between the chemical concentration in plastic and in ambient water exists. In turn, smaller and/or weathered plastic items may have dif-ferent sorption properties compared to their pristine original state (Teuten et al. 2009; Rochman et al. 2013a). Leaching and weathering for instance may change the polymers’ structure and overall polarity. For smaller particles, surface sorp-tion may become dominant over bulk partitioning, a phenomenon that probably is most relevant for polymer particles reaching the nano-scale (Velzeboer et al. 2014; Koelmans et al. 2015). Third, ingestion will bring plastic particles inside the gas-
trointestinal tract (GIT) of marine organisms where they will stay for a period of time depending on the biology of the species. Whether chemicals are being trans-ferred inside the GIT primarily depends on the gradient between chemical fugacity in the plastic and in the relevant organisms’ tissue, which for POPs and hydropho-bic chemicals in general, especially is the lipids. If there is no gradient, plastic will pass the GIT and leave the organism without any chemical transfer. The pos-sibility that there is a positive gradient between plastic and lipids receives a lot of speculation in the literature because it would imply an increase of exposure to plastic-associated chemicals compared to a scenario without ingestion of micro-plastic (Teuten et al. 2007, 2009; Hammer et al. 2012; Chua et al. 2014; Rochman 
2015). However, the reverse, i.e. a gradient towards plastic, may be evenly likely (Gouin et al. 2011; Koelmans et al. 2013a; Chua et al. 2014). This potential uptake 
pathway assumes that microplastics are not decomposed in the relative short GIT residence time of hours to days for most species. Only for really large items that cause obstruction and blockage of the GIT as is observed for instance for birds, decomposition may become relevant. In such a scenario, however, physical harm would probably cause stress and mortality earlier than that related to chemical release. Consequently, an essential difference in chemical risk originating from contaminated plastic versus that of contaminated food as a diet component is that pre-equilibrated food is digested, which leads to an immediately increased concen-tration (fugacity) inside the GIT, whereas pre-equilibrated plastic may leave the 313 11 Modeling the Role of Microplastics in Bioaccumulation …
GIT unchanged in many cases. If pre-equilibrated food and plastic are ingested 
as a mixture, the pulse exposure due to decomposition of the food inside the GIT will cause a gradient from the gut and biota lipids towards the plastic. This means that plastic ingestion can suppress biomagnification and that plastic ingestion in fact may clean the organism (Gouin et al. 2011; Koelmans et al. 2013a). Because regular biomagnification increases with trophic level, the gradient between biota lipids and plastic would be larger for higher trophic levels, leading to more trans-fer from biota lipids to the plastic. Finally, regardless of whether microplastic increases or attenuates bioaccumulation, the actual importance of plastic ingestion also depends on whether the percentage of chemical transfer due to microplastic ingestion is substantial compared to that of the other uptake pathways, such as the transfer from digested food and uptake from water. This importance in turn depends on the residence times and ingestion rates of plastic and food items in the GIT and the exchange kinetics between these items and gut fluids. In summary, the effects of microplastic on bioaccumulation can be understood from (a) changes in external exposure driven by competitive partitioning processes and (b) by changes in ‘internal’ exposure due to microplastic acting as a source or a sink depending on initial concentrations in plastic and biota lipids that determine the direction of the gradient. Several authors have provided mathematical process descriptions and parameters to quantify the processes mentioned and to unify them in an inte-grated model framework. Below, the most important approaches are provided and reviewed.
11.2.1  Equilibrium Partitioning
Addition of clean microplastic to a closed contaminated system will cause a gra-dient towards the plastic and thus lower the concentrations in the compartments present, for instance water and biota, until a new equilibrium is established. Adding contaminated plastic will cause the opposite process and lead to higher concentrations in water and biota. The kinetics of such a systems response is well-understood and depends on the response times for the individual exchange processes, i.e. water-sediment, water-biota and water-plastic. In general, the slow-est process will be rate-determining. For polymers in water, kinetics depends on the resistances to transfer, which are the resistance due to polymer diffusion and the resistance due to the undisturbed boundary layer (UBL) surrounding plastic particles. For hydrophobic chemicals and plastic particles >1 mm, it is gener -
ally assumed that the UBL resistance dominates and transfer can be described by (Schwarzenbach et al. 2003):
where t = time and k
1 (L kg−1 d−1) and k 2 (d−1) are first-order rate constants that 
can be related to the thickness of the UBL and aqueous diffusivity of the chemical, (11.1)dCPL
dt=k1CW−k2CPL314 A.A. Koelmans
and CPL (µg/kg) and CW (µg/L) are concentrations in plastic and water, respec-
tively. The presence of biofilms on the plastic may slow down the exchange kinet-
ics. In systems with excess of water and sediment, CW will not decrease due to 
sorption to plastic and can be assumed constant, i.e. C W,0 such that:
where k 1/k2 is the plastic to water partition coefficient K P,PL (L/kg), which may 
differ for different types of plastics. For chemicals that are less hydrophobic, exchange may be driven by polymer diffusion, a process that follows Fick’s 2
nd 
law of diffusion, which for spherical particles reads (Schwarzenbach et al. 2003; Teuten et al. 2009; Endo et al. 2013):
Here, the key parameters are 
Deff (m2 d−1), the effective polymer diffusion coef-
ficient and r(m), the radius of the plastic particle. Although fundamentally dif-
ferent, the modelling of the two regimes can be unified using the approximation (Schwarzenbach et al. 2003; Koelmans et al. 2013a, b):
In practice, half-lives (i.e. t
1/2 = 0.693/k 2) for desorption from microplastic parti-
cles in seawater have been reported as one day to years (Teuten et al. 2007; Endo 
et al. 2013; Bakir et al. 2014; Rochman et al. 2013a) depending on the chemical, 
the plastic, stirring conditions, presence of dissolved organic matter and measure-ment method. Because of the environmental persistence of microplastics, most particles will have resided in the water for years or decades and thus can generally be assumed to be close to sorption equilibrium.
The effect of addition of plastic on the aqueous chemical concentration in a 
simple closed sediment—water system can be calculated from a mass balance, thus:

sake of simplicity, only sediment is considered here, but for hydrophobic chemi-
cals, similar terms MiKP,i should be added for other important compartments ‘i’ 
such as phytoplankton and dissolved organic matter (DOC). Gouin et al. (2011) provided the most elaborate analysis in this respect by also including the air  compartment using air-volume and air-water partition coefficients. It follows from (11.2)

Eq. (11.5) that addition of plastic will only be important if the term MPLKP,PL in 
the denominator of (11.5) adds substantially to the terms VW+MSEDKP,SED and 
similar terms MiKP,i for phytoplankton and DOC.
11.2.2  Decomposition and Disintegration
Decomposition, disintegration or (bio)degradation have been reported to occur at 
time scales of years to decades (Andrady 2011). Recent laboratory studies report degradation of 1–1.75 % of low density PE mass in 30 d, for micro-organisms iso-lated from marine waters and with high microbial densities (Harshvardhan and Jha 2013). If surface oxidation or surface degradation is the rate-limiting step, 
overall degradation can be assumed to depend on the amount of surface area that is available. With ongoing degradation, the surface area per unit of volume will increase due to increased surface roughness, as well as reduced particle size. The  shrinking-particle theory (e.g. Di Toro et al. 1996) accounts for this change in size 
and for mono-disperse spherical particles would predict:
in which 
Vt (m3) is the particle volume at time t, V0 (m3) is the initial particle vol-
ume, d0 (m) is the initial particle diameter (spheres) or thickness (polymer films), 
α is a particle shape factor (α = 3 for spheres and α = 1 for thin films) and k s is 
the apparent shrinking-rate constant (m3 m−2 d−1). Calibration of the model on the 
~1 % PE mass loss in 30 d observed for thin films deployed by Harshvardhan and 
Jha (2013) (with α = 1 and assuming an initial thickness of 25.4 µm (1 mil) for 
their PE film), would yield a low value for k s of 4.2 × 10−9 m3 m−2 d−1. It can be 
assumed that loss of polymer equates to loss of chemical held by that  volume of 
polymer. The time scales at which these decomposition processes occur,  however, 
probably are orders of magnitude longer than the time scales of plastic-water parti-tioning or transfer inside the organisms’ gut (see below). This implies that decom-position is not directly relevant for bioaccumulation assessment.
11.2.3  Bioaccumulation
Bioaccumulation can be modelled using traditional approaches that use a mass bal-ance of uptake and loss processes (e.g. Thomann et al. 1992; Hendriks et al. 2001) (Fig. 11.1). Extensions of these models to account for uptake from contaminated par -
ticles as diet components were first provided by Sun et al. (2009) and Janssen et al. (2010). Koelmans et al. (2013a, b, 2014b) modelled bioaccumulation of hydrophobic 
chemicals (dC

where the first term quantifies dermal (for fish; including gills) uptake from water. 
The second term quantifies uptake from the diet and exchange with plastic par -
ticles. The third term quantifies overall loss due to elimination and egestion. The first and third term can be parameterised following traditional approaches with k
derm (L × kg × d−1) and k loss (d−1),  first-order rate constants for dermal 
uptake and overall loss through elimination and egestion. In the second term, IR (g × g
−1 × d−1) represents the mass of food ingested per unit of time and 
organism dry weight, a FOOD  is the absorption efficiency from the diet, S FOOD  and 
SPL are the mass fractions of food and plastic in ingested material, respectively 
(SFOOD  + S PL = 1) and C FOOD  is the chemical concentration in the diet. The prod-
uct a FOOD  × C FOOD  quantifies the contaminant concentration that is transferred 
from food, i.e. prey, to the organism during gut passage. The plastic particles may contain a biofilm (BF), which may also carry chemicals. The biofilm would con-tribute to the pool of digestible organic matter and may therefore be covered either by the sediment term or by an optional additional term in Eq. 11.7, similar to the sediment ingestion term (e.g. IR × S
BF × aBF × CBF). Where regular bioaccumu-
lation models assume digestion of diet components and thus assume a certain fixed chemical absorption efficiency, Koelmans et al. (2013a, b, 2014b) assumed plastic (11.7)dCB,t

not to degrade in the short time scale of gut passage. The transferred concentration 
from plastic during gut passage (C PLR,t, µg/kg) thus was modelled to be dependent 
on the concentrations in plastic and biota lipids, the kinetics of transfer between plastic and lipids and the GIT residence time (GRT) (see Koelmans et al. 2013a, b 
for detailed derivation):
in which k
1G and k 2G (d−1) are forward and backward first-order rate constants 
describing the transport between plastic and biota lipids inside the GIT. If the 
numerator term k1GCPL−k2GCL,t in Eq. 11.8 is positive, transfer from the plas-
tic to biota lipids occurs, whereas opposite transfer (‘cleaning by plastic’) occurs when the term is negative. Various authors have provided these k values at simu-lated gut conditions, showing about an order of magnitude enhancement of trans-fer rates in artificial gut fluids up to k
1G = 10–12 d−1 (Teuten et al. 2007; Bakir 
et al. 2014). GRT is gut residence time (d), C PL and C L,t (µg/kg) are the chemical 
concentrations in the ingested plastic particle and the biota lipids at the moment of ingestion and M
PL and M L are the mass of plastic and lipids in the organism, 
respectively (kg). If C W is constant in time (Eqs. 11.2 and 11.5) and C PL is esti-
mated by Eq. 11.2, an analytical solution to Eqs. 11.7 and 11.8 is available that calculates the body burden at steady state (

Note, that Eq. 11.9 accounts for all uptake and loss pathways and can be used to assess the relative importance of plastic ingestion as an uptake pathway compared to other pathways such as food ingestion and dermal uptake, as well as the impor -
tance of chemical loss by plastic egestion compared to regular loss mechanisms.
11.3  Model-Based Assessment of Implications and Risks  
of Plastic-Associated Chemicals
Various authors used the aforementioned concepts to assess the effects and impor -
tance of plastic-associated chemicals on chemical partitioning and bioaccumula-
tion. This section reviews these studies. Teuten et al. (2007) modelled the effect of adding ‘clean’ plastic to a sediment-water system (1.5 kg sediment, 0.4 L 
water, 1.5 g lugworm A. marina) contaminated with phenanthrene as a model  compound using an equilibrium partitioning approach (Eq. 11.5). They concluded (11.8)

that  plastic addition would reduce bioavailability due to scavenging of phenan-
threne by the plastic. The effect was small (13 %) and depended on factors such 
as  partition coefficients of the plastic and sediment, which also follows from 
Eq. 11.5. In another scenario, they assumed chemical concentrations in micro-
plastic to be much higher in the sea-surface micro layer (SML) than in the water column. Subsequent settling and exposure of sediment biota to these enriched microplastic particles would lead to increased bioaccumulation. Both scenarios, however, used equilibrium partitioning concepts only and did not yet consider sediment and/or plastic ingestion as a possible uptake pathway. This implies that attenuation of bioaccumulation was not accounted for. There may also be some  uncertainty related to the acclaimed enrichment in the SML. Analysis of the 
SML by Hardy et al. (1988, 1990) did not use passive samplers that would have 
detected the truly dissolved concentrations, but used analysis of total concentra-tions after  filtration. Filtration is known to be insufficient in removing DOC and 
colloids present (e.g. Gschwend and Wu 1985). Because the SML is enriched with DOC, organic  colloids, micro-organisms or oil films that act as ‘extracting agents’, 
this explains the enhanced apparent concentrations in the SML (e.g. Wurl et al. 2006). This is also consistent with SML concentration enrichment factors usually being higher for coastal areas and bays that have higher DOC levels, and for more hydrophobic chemicals. The truly dissolved chemical concentrations in the SML, 
however, would still be equal or close to those in the bulk of the water column, thus  preventing enrichment of concentrations in microplastic. Furthermore, if an 
enhancement of concentrations in microplastics compared to the water column would still occur, desorption would probably attenuate the gradient upon settling in the water  column and burial in the sediment.
Gouin et al. (2011) also used equilibrium partitioning concepts to define the 
chemical distribution of POPs among air, water, sediment and plastic, and used steady-state bioaccumulation modelling to assess their subsequent fate in the food web. Instead of considering one chemical their analysis spanned a wide range of chemical hydrophobicities and air-water partition coefficients. A model environment was defined representative of a coastal marine ecosystem with a realistic input of plastic debris. Mass-balance equations were used to construct chemical space diagrams. Data analysis showed that partitioning to PE was  negligible (<0.1 % of chemical mass). Only if it was assumed that the present 
 estimate of PE abundance was enhanced by three orders of magnitude and that the 
water contained no organic matter (i.e. DOC or phytoplankton) PE would became important (>1 % sorption to PE) for POPs with LogK
ow > 5. This implies that 
present plastic loadings were calculated to be insufficient to cause a meaningful redistribution of POPs from the oceanic environment to the plastic. Furthermore, DOC and phytoplankton that compete with plastic for POP distribution should be accounted for in order to assess whether future accumulation of plastic could lead to a substantial redistribution of POPs. Gouin et al. (2011) also discussed effects of PE presence on bioaccumulation by piscivorous fish, by including  contaminated 
PE as a diet component in an elaborate food web bioaccumulation model.  
A steady-state approach was used that did not yet consider the kinetics of 319 11 Modeling the Role of Microplastics in Bioaccumulation …
desorption from the plastic inside the gut, in relation to gut retention time. This 
means that the direction of an effect of PE ingestion would be calculated correctly but that its magnitude may have been overestimated because the model could not account for the extent of non-equilibrium in the gut. Interestingly, the authors found a counterintuitive decrease in predicted body burden upon an increase in PE in the diet. This was explained by the fact that without plastic, food organic matter is digested leading to high concentrations in the gut that subsequently are transferred to the organisms’ lipids. In the presence of plastic, however, which is not degraded, a gradient from lipids towards plastic exists, leading to cleaning of the organism by the plastic.
Koelmans et al. (2013a, b) presented a general POP bioaccumulation model 
framework for marine aquatic organisms combining Eqs. 11.1–11.9, which was implemented for A. marina (Fig. 11.1). The model accounted for dilution of  exposure concentration by sorption of POPs to plastic (POP ‘dilution’), increased 
 bioaccumulation by ingestion of plastic containing POPs (‘carrier’), and decreased 
bioaccumulation by ingestion of clean plastic (‘cleaning’). Kinetics in the gut were explicitly taken into account. The model was evaluated against bioaccumulation data from laboratory bioassays with PS microplastic. Further scenarios included PE microplastic, nano-sized plastic and open marine systems. Scenario studies assumed equilibrium of organisms and plastics prior to ingestion, as would occur for POPs in the environment. Model analysis showed that PS will have a decreas-ing effect on bioaccumulation, governed by dilution. For stronger sorbents such as polyethylene, the dilution, carrier and cleaning mechanism were more substantial. In closed laboratory bioassay systems, dilution and cleaning dominated,  leading 
to decreased bioaccumulation. Also, in open marine systems a decrease was pre-dicted due to a cleaning mechanism that counteracts biomagnification, similar to that recognized earlier by Gouin et al. (2011). However, the differences were  considered too small to be relevant from a risk assessment perspective.
Pollution by POPs is diffuse, which implies that POPs will be always present 
at background concentrations, often at solid phase—water equilibrium (Van Noort 
and Koelmans 2012). In the early life stages of organisms, POP concentrations in the organism will be in equilibrium with the ambient water too, which implies that ingestion of polluted microplastic will coincide with the ingestion of  polluted 
food, rendering the contribution of microplastic relatively unimportant. For  additives, however, plastic ingestion by marine organisms may potentially be more 
relevant than for diffusely spread POPs because the plastic could still be a source of the additives (Teuten et al. 2009; Hammer et al. 2012; Koelmans et al. 2014b). 
Furthermore, compared to worms, leaching of additives or residual monomers may be more relevant for larger and longer-lived species, with longer gut reten-tion times, such as fish. Two recent controlled laboratory studies confirmed that dietary exposure of organisms to microplastic pre-adsorbed with POPs or additives leads to chemical transfer from the microplastic to the organism (Browne et al. 2013; Rochman et al. 2013b). A remaining question, however, is what the relative importance of this microplastic uptake pathway is under natural conditions, where other pathways like dermal uptake, uptake via the gills or consumption of natural 320 A.A. Koelmans
prey play a role. Furthermore, it is plausible that in actual marine systems, back-
ground chemical concentrations in biota may already exceed the concentrations that microplastic ingestion would be able to explain, in which case no  gradient for 
transfer would exist.
In a follow up study, Koelmans et al. (2014b) used the same biodynamic 
model as was used for POPs to assess the potential of leaching of nonylphenol (NP) and bisphenol A (BPA) in the intestinal tracts of lugworm (A. marina) and cod (Gadus morhua). Parameters for the lugworm were based on Besseling et al. (2013). Parameters for cod were based on actual abundances of microplastic par -
ticles in the cod GIT as observed by Foekema et al. (2013). The resulting model was validated against the data provided by Browne et al. (2013) for leaching of NP from PVC to A. marina. Then, the model was used to calculate the body bur -
dens that could be explained from plastic ingestion, which were compared to NP and BPA body burdens actually measured in the field. Uncertainty in the most cru-cial parameters was accounted for by probabilistic modelling. The conservative analysis showed that plastic ingestion by the lugworm indeed results in chemical transfer to the organism, but yields NP and BPA concentrations that stay below the lower ends of global NP and BPA concentration ranges in the lugworm, and therefore is unlikely to constitute a relevant exposure pathway. A similar compari-son showed that plastic ingestion is also likely to constitute a negligible exposure pathway for cod.
Note that the key model concepts of chemical transfer in the intestinal tract or 
segments of the intestinal tract as condensed in Eqs. 11.7–11.9 are also applicable to higher marine organisms. They would only need different parameterizations and different initial boundary conditions.
11.4  Summarizing Discussion and Recommendations
This chapter discussed the present state of the art in modelling chemical trans-fer between microplastic and biota in relation to the experimental data available. Whereas the experimental data and field observations serve as best available proof of the actual occurrence of transfer processes that have been speculated on in the literature for a long time, model analysis has helped to understand why these effects occur, and to quantify their magnitude and direction. General prognos-tic risk assessments regarding plastic-associated chemicals will need simulation models for the same reasons why models are needed in general PBT assessment (Weisbrod et al. 2009).
Generally, the present experimental studies and model studies are consistent in 
that they can predict up to a factor of two to three increase in bioaccumulation if microplastic is the only source of the chemical and the only pathway of uptake. Conversely, they predict a decrease in bioaccumulation when chemical  dilution 
outcompetes transfer in the gut. If more environmentally relevant scenarios are 321 11 Modeling the Role of Microplastics in Bioaccumulation …
considered, i.e. with pre-equilibrated systems and all exposure pathways are 
accounted for, ingestion of microplastics seems to be much less important than the existing pathways. This does not mean that the hazards of plastic-associated chemicals are less than anticipated, but it may imply that the relevance of plastic ingestion as an additional exposure pathway may be less relevant than what has been assumed in the literature (e.g. Teuten et al. 2007, 2009; Hammer et al. 2012; 
Browne et al. 2013; Chua et al. 2014), at least for POPs.
Chemical transfer effects should not be studied or interpreted from chemi-
cal principles alone assuming biota to be a constant factor. Plastic ingestion may cause physical stress, for instance due to blockage of the GIT or decreased overall food quality (Lusher 2015), which in turn may affect ingestion rates, lipid contents, growth rates and in turn kinetic parameters for chemical transfer. Distinguishing between these chemical and biological effect mechanisms is an important challenge when interpreting bioaccumulation data from the laboratory or the field.
Although considerable progress has been made over the past years, there still 
is only a hand full of bioaccumulation studies addressing transfer from micro-plastic, typically of a ‘proof of principle’ nature. The processes at play seem to be well understood, their parameterisation, however, may need more work. While diffusion parameters and partition coefficients for pristine polymers are available, chemical exchange kinetics for microplastics under conditions of weathering, deg-radation and biofilm formation in the marine environment are poorly understood. Chemical exchange in the GIT has been investigated using artificial gut fluids, but dedicated dietary exposure experiments may provide better parameterisations for a wider range of chemicals. Hazard assessment of plastic-associated chemi-cals should ideally not only focus on particular biota and chemicals, but also use a systems approach accounting for all exposure pathways, including food web mag-nification and chemical mixtures. It is most plausible that marine organisms expe-rience a trade-off between negative effects of chemical transfer from additives to the organism, and positive effects of attenuation of POP bioaccumulation, upon ingestion of microplastic (Koelmans et al. 2014b). In this respect, experimental 
model-validation studies using contaminated organisms and clean plastic may be as important to advance the science as most present studies that use an inverse gradient. Finally, a better quantitative understanding is needed with respect to the role of microplastic ingestion in the chemical transfer of degradable compounds. As recently pointed out by Rochman et al. (2013b), degradable compounds such as PAH and PBDEs are known to biomagnify less from prey due to degradation in the water column or metabolization by the organism or by prey species lower in the marine food web (e.g. Di Paolo et al. 2010). Because these chemicals would be preserved by sorption to microplastic, this could increase the relative role of microplastic ingestion as a relevant pathway for these chemicals. This means that the aforementioned effect of suppression of bioaccumulation of POPs would be less relevant for these degradable compounds.322 A.A. Koelmans

M. Bergmann et al. (eds.), Marine Anthropogenic Litter,  DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-16510-3_12Abstract A growing body of literature reports on the abundance and effects of 
plastic debris, with an increasing focus on microplastic particles smaller than 
5 mm. It has often been suggested that plastic particles in the <100 nm size range as defined earlier for nanomaterials (here referred to as ‘nanoplastics’), may be emitted to or formed in the aquatic environment. Nanoplastics is probably the least known area of marine litter but potentially also the most hazardous. This paper provides the first review on sources, effects and hazards of nanoplastics. Detection methods are in an early stage of development and to date no nanoplastics have actually been detected in natural aquatic systems. Various sources of nanoplastics have been suggested such as release from products or nanofragmentation of larger particles. Nanoplastic fate studies for rivers show an important role for sedimen-tation of heteroaggregates, similar to that for non-polymer nanomaterials. Some prognostic effect studies have been performed but effect thresholds seem higher than nanoplastic concentrations expected in the environment. The high surface area of nanoplastics may imply that toxic chemicals are retained by nanoplastics, possibly increasing overall hazard. Release of non-polymer nanomaterial additives from small product fragments may add to the hazard of nanoplastics. Because

of the presence of such co-contaminants, effect studies with nanoplastics pose 
some specific practical challenges. We conclude that hazards of nanoplastics are plausible yet unclear, which calls for a thorough evaluation of nanoplastic sources, fate and effects.
12.1  Introduction
Today, pollution with plastic debris and plastic fragments has been recognized as a major water quality problem in fresh and marine water systems. Various recent reviews address the sources, abundance and negative effects of plastic  litter (e.g. Derraik 2002; Andrady 2011; Hammer et al. 2012; Koelmans et al. 
2014a), including several other chapters in this volume (Browne 2015; Galgani 
et al. 2015; Thompson 2015). Science in this field is evolving rapidly, with ini-
tial studies mainly focusing on detection and abundance of >5 mm macroplastic in 
marine ecosystems and biota, followed by an increasing focus on <5 mm micro-plastics ranging down to the µm-scale. Implications of nanometre-sized plastic particles (‘nanoplastics’), constitute a very recent area of the environmental sci-ences. Nanoplastics are of specific interest because of their nano-specific prop-erties, which fundamentally differ from those of the same polymer type in bulk form (Klaine et al. 2012). A clear definition of what should be named a ‘nano-plastic’ has not yet been provided. For the sake of this review we suggest to fol-low the definition used for non-polymer nanomaterials, implying that a plastic particle is said to be nano-sized if it is <100 nm in at least one of its dimensions (Klaine et al. 2012). This links the name of the size class to the most conveni-ent scale to actually express this size (i.e. nanometre), it assures a focus on the nano-specific properties and thus their associated hazards, it avoids confusion with the broad scientific field of nano-EHS, and it ensures that a discussion of regula-tory implications of nanoplastics may benefit from the past and present develop-ments in the regulation of other manufactured nanomaterials. It must be noted that the classification of plastic particles is not a trivial issue. Earlier, microplastic has been defined as all particles <5 mm, thus automatically including nanometre-sized 
plastic particles (Arthur et al. 2009). Another recent definition uses <20 µm as a criterion to classify nanoplastics (Wagner et al. 2014), similar to the cut off used by plankton ecologists for nanoplankton. This definition thus includes micrometre-sized particles. Furthermore, it must be stressed that in the fields of nanotechnol-ogy and material science the term ‘nanoplastics’ is already used for those plastics that have nanoscale additives to give the material specific properties (e.g. Bussière et al. 2013). In this chapter on environmental implications, we classify nanoplastic (NP) as particles <100 nm for the reasons stated.
NPs is probably the least known area of marine litter but potentially also the 
most hazardous. Various sources of NPs have been suggested such as release from products or formation from larger particles (‘nanofragmentation’) (Andrady 2011; Shim et al. 2014; Cózar et al. 2014). Detection methods are in an early stage of 327

development but to date no NPs have been detected in natural aquatic systems. 
Some first prognostic bioaccumulation and effect studies have been performed (Brown et al. 2001; Ward and Kach 2009; Bhattacharya et al. 2010; Wegner et al. 2012; Lee et al. 2013; Casado et al. 2013; Besseling et al. 2014b) but there is no 
systematic effect assessment for relevant aquatic species let alone for the com-munity or ecosystem level. Apart from physiological consequences, NPs might also have chemical effects. The high surface area of NPs may cause exceptionally strong sorption affinities for toxic compounds (Velzeboer et al. 2014a), potentially leading to cumulative particle and chemical toxicity effects once NPs have passed cell membranes. Furthermore, if nanofragmentation is a relevant process, release of non-polymer nanoscale additives from the product fragments may further add to the overall hazard (Nowack et al. 2012).
The aim of this chapter is to present and critically discuss the literature 
on detection, sources, fate and effects of NPs. Because the literature on NPs is still limited, our synthesis builds on knowledge about bulk polymers i.e. micro- and macroplastics as well as on knowledge about non-polymer nanomaterials. Challenges in performing ecotoxicity tests with NPs are discussed and an outlook to future work and recommendations are provided. The potential effects of NP on human health are covered by Galloway (2015).
12.2  Sources, Detection and Occurrence of Nanoplastic
12.2.1  Sources of Nanoplastic
Primary sources of NPs may relate to release from products and applications, in which nanoplastics are used or formed and that result in emissions to the envi-ronment during the product life cycle. Product categories may include  waterborne 
paints, adhesives, coatings, redispersible lattices, biomedical products, drug deliv-ery, medical diagnostics, electronics, magnetics and optoelectronics. Recently, thermal cutting of polystyrene foam has been shown to emit nanometre-sized  polymer particles, in the range of ~22–220 nm (Zhang et al. 2012). Many poly-
mers undergo similar thermal treatments during their life cycle. 3-D printing has been shown to emit nanometre-sized polymer particles, in the range of ~11–116 nm, at considerable rates (Stephens et al. 2013). Polystyrene and  polyethylene 
nanoparticles are easy to synthesize (e.g. Lu et al. 2009; Rao and Geckeler 
2011), are used for research and other applications and thus will find their way into the environment. Several medical applications include polymeric nanoparti-cles, nanospheres and nanocapsules, used for drug delivery (Guterres et al. 2007), which are, however, biodegradable solid lipids. Although formally within scope, we argue that such nanoplastics are not likely to be hazardous because of their low  persistence in the environment. Cosmetic products are often mentioned 
in the context of nanoplastics. However, recent product inventories show low-est sizes of ~4 µm present in exfoliating scrubs or skin cleansers (Fendall and 328 A.A. Koelmans et al.
Sewell 2009), rendering these products as an unlikely primary source of NPs.  
A second  speculated source is fragmentation of microplastic to smaller-sized par -
ticles  eventually reaching the nanoscale (Andrady 2011). Electrospinning of engi-
neered plastics is used to produce mats with nanoscale fibres, which when applied 
in products might degrade further to the nanoscale (Lu et al. 2008). Polymers consist of a mixture of polymer chains of various lengths. The chains are chemi-cally linked by weak secondary bonds (i.e. hydrogen or Van der Waals bonding) or by physical interaction through entanglement of chains, whereas there is void space in between the chains. The weak interactions are susceptible to breakage at a low energy level. This breakage brings embrittlement, which in combination with other external forces such as friction may cause formation of small particles in the nano-, micro- and millimetre size range, at the surface of the plastics. Shim et al. (2014) were the first to actually report fragmentation of expanded polysty-rene (EPS) beads to micro- and nano-sized EPS in experiments involving a month of accelerated mechanical abrasion with glass beads and sand. Formation of nano-metre-sized EPS was confirmed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Fig. 12.1). Without yet even tak-ing UV exposure into account, these experimental conditions may already mimic conditions at beaches or river banks where prolonged abrasion of macro- and microplastics by sand particles possibly leads to the formation of NPs. The combi-nation of photo-oxidation by UV exposure, high temperature and high humidity at beaches probably enhances fragmentation rates and reduces the size of the plastic

12 Nanoplastics in the Aquatic Environment. Critical Review
particles. However, the occurrence and relative importance of this process still has 
to be validated in the field. Still, given the available information, we suspect that physical abrasion is a relevant source of NPs.
Although not proven, degradation of microplastics down to the <100 nanometre-  
scale may constitute a third source of NPs. Slow weathering by photodegradation is well known for all kinds of polymers (Sivan 2011), which is the reason that nano-composites use manufactured nano-particles (nanofillers) to increase the resistance to oxidation (e.g. Grigoriadou et al. 2011; Bussière et al. 2013). UV-B  irradiation 
aided photo-oxidation of LDPE has been shown to lead to the formation of  extractable oxygenated compounds as well as non-oxidised low-molecular weight 
hydrocarbons, which were utilized by bacteria leading to an LDPE mass loss of 8.4 % in 14 days (Roy et al. 2008). The LDPE films subsequently were too  fragile 
to handle. In a recent environmental study, degradation of 1–1.75 % of PE mass was observed in the laboratory in 30 days, by micro-organisms isolated from marine waters present at high densities (Harshvardhan and Jha 2013). Koelmans (2015)  suggested that a surface degradation based particle shrinking model may be applied 
to assess the time dependence of the loss of plastic volume. Using this model and laboratory volume loss rate data from Harshvardhan and Jha (2013), we calculated the time scales required to reach the 100 nm nanoscale as a function of initial plastic particle size. It appears that if oxidation/degradation of the plastic surface would be the rate-limiting process, the rather optimal conditions in the laboratory still would predict that ca. 320 years are needed to bring 1 mm (1000 μ m) microplastics to the 
100 nm nanoscale (Fig. 12.2). In the oceans, degradation can be assumed to proceed

 biodegradation at the polymer surface, as a function of initial microplastic particle size. The 
 scenario  calculation assumes particle shrinking due to photo-oxidation and biodegradation only, 
and neglects embrittlement and erosion. The reaction rate is proportional to the surface area with 
rate constant, k′ as in dV(t) = −k′A(t)dt with V (m3), and A (m2) are particle volume and surface 
area, respectively. The ‘Lab scenario’ is based on a mass loss of ~1 % low density polyethylene (LDPE) per month as observed under laboratory conditions by Harshvardhan and Jha (2013). It appears that a particle of 1000 μm (1 mm) diameter requires about 320 years to reach a diameter of 100 nm. In the oceans, degradation can be assumed to proceed much slower due to limited availability of light, oxygen and bacteria330 A.A. Koelmans et al.
much slower due to limited availability of light, oxygen and bacteria. Microbial or 
photodegradation at the water surface thus may contribute to the formation of smaller particles, yet reaching the nanoscale may take a long time. We are not aware of  studies showing NP formation due to these processes. Nano-fragmentation thus may 
involve two mechanisms; (1) direct nano-fragmentation may take place at the surface of macro- and microplastics (major process) and further gradual size-reductions may take place due to degradation (minor process). The different time scales of the two processes imply that embrittlement followed by physical abrasion of microplastics probably is the most important process explaining the formation of NPs.
12.2.2  Detection and Occurrence of Nanoplastic
We are not aware of studies reporting established analytical methods to detect  nanoplastics in marine or freshwater. Under controlled conditions in the 
 laboratory, several methods that apply to nanomaterials in general are also  useful 
for nanoplastic fate and effect research, such as UV-VIS spectrometry, electron 
microscopy, field flow fractionation (FFF) or dynamic light scattering (DLS)  techniques, each having their advantages and flaws (V on der Kammer et al. 2012). 
Shim et al. (2014) used SEM-EDS to confirm the presence of nanoplastics in 
 abrasion experiments. In their effect study with mussels (Mytilus edulis), Wegner 
et al. (2012) used multiple wavelength UV-VIS as a proxy to detect pink-dyed nanoparticles and used dynamic light scattering (DLS) to track the actual size of the bioavailable aggregates over time. Velzeboer et al. (2014a) used  transmission 
EM and conventional light microscopy to characterise pristine nanopolystyrene particles and aggregates, respectively. A recent study applied FFF coupled to multi-angle light scattering with pyrolysis to discriminate between various plastic types in spiked natural surface water samples (Kools et al. 2014).
Since separation, concentration and identification of NPs in environmental sam-
ples is still difficult, the actual occurrence of NPs is still a matter of speculation even though recent literature takes it as a fact. In his review, Andrady (2011) stated that there is little doubt that nanoscale particles are produced during weathering of plas-tic debris, but acknowledges that they are not yet quantified. The evidence is cir -
cumstantial in that abrasion indeed seems to show formation of nanoplastics in the laboratory (Shim et al. 2014). A study by Cózar et al. (2014) identified a deficiency of plastic particles at the lower end of an expected size distribution in the oceans and argued that nanofragmentation might be a plausible explanation for this deficiency.
12.3  Fate of Nanoplastic
Because NPs have not yet been measured in aquatic systems, only prognostic assessments of NP fate are possible. Freshwater carries plastics from land-based sources to the sea, which renders fate modelling of microplastics and NPs an 331

important area of research. In the literature, several processes have been identified 
as being important to address when modelling the fate of nanomaterials in fresh-water, and a range of elaborate fate models are currently available (Gottschalk et al. 2013; Meesters et al. 2014; Quik et al. 2014). We argue that these models can be used for nanoplastics too, as long as some specific differences relating to densities, biofilm formation and attachment efficiencies are accounted for. For aquatic behaviour of nano-materials such as NPs, homo- and hetero-aggregation, advective flow, sedimentation, re-suspension, photo- and biodegradation, and sediment burial are important processes to consider (Quik et al. 2014; Besseling et al. 2014a). Velzeboer et al. (2014a) used pristine 60 nm polystyrene parti-cles and observed a wide range of aggregate sizes, i.e. 199.3 ± 176.3 nm (range  
100–500 nm) after 28 days, using TEM. Bhattacharya et al. (2010) measured sub-stantial binding or heteroaggregation of 20 nm polystyrene particles with fresh-water phytoplankton cells. Because of their low density, it is often assumed that substantial fractions of the total load of plastic particles from riverine sources reach the sea (Cózar et al. 2014; Wagner et al. 2014). However, it is plausible that organic matter fouling and subsequent hetero-aggregation with suspended sol-ids, algae or detritus will cause settling and several recent reports indeed show presence of microplastics in the sediments (Zbyszewski and Corcoran 2011; Zbyszewski et al. 2014; Imhof et al. 2013; Wagner et al. 2014; Free et al. 2014). This process is relevant especially for NPs, because hetero-aggregation is particu-larly important at the nanometre-scale. In freshwater, burial is important to con-sider as it may be a loss process for nanomaterials from the biologically relevant sediment top layer (Koelmans et al. 2009). The loss processes including photo- or biodegradation have been discussed in the previous section. Besseling et al. (2014a) presented the first spatially explicit NP fate model that accounted for all the aforementioned processes. The model was implemented for a 40-km river stretch and showed the dependence of NP retention on nano- and microplastic par -
ticle size, density and attachment efficiencies. Simulations showed that settling of 100 nm NPs was stimulated by fast orthokinetic heteroaggregation, whereas for microplastics >0.1 mm Stokes settling dominated.
In marine systems, the same processes occur, although flow patterns, residence 
times and the nature of natural colloids and suspended solids (marine snow) are very different. Attachment efficiencies will be higher than in freshwaters due to the higher ionic strength. Collision frequencies however, will be lower due to much lower concentrations of natural colloids and solids in the water column. This trade-off has not yet been quantified for NPs. Wegner et al. (2012) were the first to measure and model the homoaggregation of 30 nm polystyrene particles in seawater and found rapid formation of 1000 nm aggregates within 16 min-utes. Attachment efficiencies of 1 were required to explain the experimental observations (Wegner et al. 2012). Velzeboer et al. (2014a) used pristine 60 nm  carboxylated polystyrene particles and observed a wide range of aggregate sizes, 
i.e. 361.1 ± 465.1 nm (TEM, range 100–500 nm) after 28 days (Fig. 12.3), which thus were larger than those observed in freshwater, as mentioned above. The 40 nm carboxylated polystyrene particles used by Della Torre et al. (2014) formed aggregates of 1764 ± 409 nm in natural seawater, whereas their 50 nm 332 A.A. Koelmans et al.
amino modified polystyrene remained dispersed at the nanoscale (89 ± 2 nm), 
although the authors report that these particles also partly aggregated with time. Another difference compared to freshwaters relates to the density of seawater, which is higher at lower temperature and higher salinity and thus increases with depth, an increase that additionally depends on season and location. The density of NP aggregates will also vary depending on polymer type, NP surface chemistry, extent of organic matter fouling and the thickness and nature of the biofilm once aggregates are formed. This means that settling of NP aggregates occurs until they reach seawater density and thereafter remain adrift in the water column (Cózar et al. 2014). Small changes in either aggregate or seawater density may cause slow upward or downward transport. Models that specifically simulate NP behaviour in the marine environment have not been published yet. However, because marine NP behaviour probably is behaviour of NP aggregates (Velzeboer et al. 2014a, b), 
Smoluchowski-Stokes based marine biogeochemical models can be applied such as those applied previously for settling of organic and mineral particles (e.g. Burd and Jackson 2009; Barkmann et al. 2010).
12.4  Bioaccumulation and Effects
12.4.1  Bioaccumulation and Effects of Nanoplastics
A handful of studies have investigated the accumulation or effects of NPs.  
As for membrane passage, Rossi et al. (2014) used molecular simulations to

 aggregates in freshwater (left) and seawater (right). Note that the TEM-based data may reflect

12 Nanoplastics in the Aquatic Environment. Critical Review
assess the effect of nano-sized polystyrene on the properties of model  biological 
 membranes and concluded that the NPs could permeate easily into lipid 
 membranes, which may affect cellular functions. Experimental validation would 
still be required to assess the actual relevance of this pathway. In this respect, Salvati et al. (2011) showed that carboxylated nanopolystyrene with sizes rang-ing from 40 to 50 nm entered cells irreversibly, by different endocytosis pathways. 
Inflammation responses have been observed in rat lung tissue in response to 64 nm polystyrene particles, showing that a low-toxicity material, such as polystyrene, can have inflammatory potential when present in nano-size (Brown et al. 2001). This study used an air-inhalation exposure scenario and the question remains to what extent this can be translated to aquatic systems, where aggregation would limit the concentrations of free NPs and direct inhalation of air-dispersed NPs does not occur. Bhattacharya et al. (2010) showed that adsorption of 1.8–6.5 mg/L of 20 nm polystyrene particles (yet present as agglomerates) hindered algal photosynthesis, possibly through reduction of light intensity and of air flow by the nanoparticles, and stimulated Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production. Ward and Kach (2009) showed that mussels (Mytilus edulis) and oysters (Crassostrea virginica) take up 100 nm PS beads, especially when incorporated into aggregates. They concluded that the direct bioavailability of freely dispersed NPs was very low and that cap-ture and ingestion were the dominant exposure pathways for these species. Wegner et al. (2012) showed that mussels reduced their filter-feeding activity in response to 100 mg/L 30 nm nanopolystyrene. In two-generation chronic toxicity tests, Lee et al. (2013) showed nanopolystyrene ingestion by copepods (Tigriopus japonicus) and detected mortality of nauplii and copepodites for 50 nm (yet partly aggregated) polystyrene particles at concentrations of 12.5 mg/L (F0 generation) and 1.25 mg/L (next generation). Della Torre et al. (2014) observed severe developmental effects of amino-modified polystyrene nanoparticles in the early development of sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus) embryos, with EC
50 values of 3.85 and 2.61 mg/L at 
24 and 48 h post fertilization. Kashiwada (2006) reported sorption of 39.4 nm nan-opolystyrene to the chorion of medaka (Oryzias latipes) eggs and uptake into the yolk and gallbladder during embryonic development, whereas adults accumulated the NPs mainly in the gills and intestine yet also in the brain, testis, liver and blood. It was thus suggested that the NPs were capable of passing the blood–brain barrier. The acute (24 h) toxicity to medaka eggs was zero and 35.6 % for 1 and 30 mg/L NPs, respectively, although toxicity increased with higher salinity.
We are aware of three studies that use freshwater species. Cedervall et al. 
(2012) showed that 25 nm nanopolystyrene particles were transported through an aquatic food chain from green algae (Scenedesmus sp.), through water fleas (Daphnia magna) to carp (Carassius carassius) and other fishes, and affected lipid metabolism and behaviour of the fish. The effects were mechanistically explained from the chemistry and dynamics of the protein corona surrounding the NPs. Because it was a feeding study, effects could not be linked to NP concentration in the water. Casado et al. (2013) investigated the effects of 55 and 110 nm poly-ethyleneimine polystyrene nanoparticles on algae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapi-tata), crustaceans (Thamnocephalus platyurus; Daphnia magna), bacteria (Vibrio 334 A.A. Koelmans et al.
fischeri) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) cell lines (cytotoxicity). 
Effects were detected for the in vivo species with EC 50 values between 0.54 and 
5.2 mg/L, whereas EC 50 values for cytotoxicity were between ~60 and 87 mg/L. 
Besseling et al. (2014b) reported that 70 nm polystyrene particles reduced the growth of algae (Scenedesmus obliquus) at high particle concentrations, and malformed offspring of Daphnia at a concentration of 32 mg/L. The effects on Daphnia were studied with and without fish (Perca fluviatilis) kairomones in the water and the effect of the kairomones appeared to be stronger in the presence of 1.8 mg/L nanoplastic. This suggests that nanoplastics might interfere with the chemical communication among species, which would cause subtle behavioural disturbances in finding a mate or food, or in the avoidance of predators such as fish. Such effects may be taking place at low concentrations that are not easy to detect using standard toxicological tests but that may result in changes in the food web in exposed ecosystems over time.
In summary, the limited literature provides some evidence of effects of NPs to 
marine and freshwater organisms, yet at relatively high concentrations, i.e. higher than ~0.5 mg/L NPs. There are currently no NP environmental concentrations to which this value can be compared, but the lowest NP effect concentration of 0.54 mg/L (Casado et al. 2013) is about four to six orders of magnitude higher than the 0.4–34 ng/L microplastic concentrations found in freshwaters in the USA 
(Eriksen et al. 2013) and Europe (Besseling et al. 2014c), but almost similar to the 
highest  concentration estimated for marine water (i.e. 0.51 mg/L, see Besseling et al. 2014b; Lopez Lozano and Mouat 2009). However, because of the limited data, the uncertainties in these numbers and the absence of actual NP exposure data, these comparisons should be interpreted with caution.
12.4.2  Implications of Chemicals and Nanofillers Associated 
with Nanoplastics
Various kinds of additives are added during the manufacturing of plastics to 
increase its durability. Furthermore, residual monomers may remain in the  plastic. 
For NPs in particular, the high surface area may cause exceptionally strong  sorption affinities for ‘external’ toxic compounds (Velzeboer et al. 2014a), which 
implies that they will always be loaded with hydrophobic toxicants or trace met-als (Rochman 2013a, 2014; Holmes et al. 2014). It can be hypothesized that 
the  presence of such additives and absorbed chemicals might lead to increased 
 exposure to these toxicants. In the laboratory, transfer and negative effects of such 
co-contaminants have indeed been shown upon ingestion of microplastic parti-cles, but only in scenarios where clean organisms were exposed to plastics with rather high concentrations (Rochman et al. 2013b; Browne et al. 2013; Chua et al. 2014), thus forcing a maximum fugacity gradient upon the organism. Under more 
 realistic natural exposure scenarios where organisms as well as the media water, 
sediment and plastic were brought at or close to equal chemical fugacity, no or 335
12 Nanoplastics in the Aquatic Environment. Critical Review
limited (i.e. within a factor of two) increases or decreases in  chemical  transfer 
of toxicants were found (Besseling et al. 2013). Several studies even showed  
 beneficial effects of microplastic ingestion by reducing bioaccumulation due 
to sorption of chemicals to the plastic (Teuten et al. 2007; Gouin et al. 2011; Koelmans et al. 2013a, b; Chua et al. 2014). These different outcomes illustrate 
how the ‘carrier effects’ of microplastic depend on the initial boundary conditions of the test, which determine the direction of mass transfer between ingested or bio-accumulated plastic and tissue. This is consistent with recent model analyses that systematically explored these exposure scenarios (Gouin et al. 2011; Koelmans et al. 2013a, b, 2014b; Koelmans 2015). While the actual risk caused by chemical 
transfer due to microplastic ingestion may thus be of limited importance, exposure to NPs may still constitute a real hazard. Because of the surface effect, it may be possible that NPs retain organic toxic chemicals or heavy metals at higher concen-trations than microplastics, thus leading to a fugacity gradient to organism tissue once ingested. If NPs are capable of permeating membranes, passing cell walls, translocate and/or reside in epithelial tissues for prolonged times (Kashiwada 2006; Cedervall et al. 2012; Rossi et al. 2014), the combination of particle and chemical toxicity may yield unforeseen risks. These hypotheses need to be experi-mentally validated, while also accounting for the possibly low  bioavailability 
of NPs due to aggregation. During nanofragmentation, release of non-polymer nanoscale additives from the polymer nanocomposite product fragments may further add to the overall hazard (Nowack et al. 2012; Schlagenhauf et al. 2014). The smaller the additives, the better the improvement of polymer durability, which explains the addition of engineered nanoparticles such as carbon nanotubes (Grigoriadou et al. 2011; Bussière et al. 2013; Schlagenhauf et al. 2014). Although 
beneficial for their application, these additives increase the persistence of plastics in the environment and once degraded, may increase the overall risk due to an additional emission of nanomaterials.
12.5  Specific Challenges in Nanoplastic Effect Research
Several specific problems may arise when using NPs in aquatic tests or whole  sediment toxicity tests with or without co-contaminants present. At present, it is 
not possible to detect NPs in the environment or to isolate sufficient quantities from the environment for effects research. This implies that manufactured NPs need to be used. This promotes uniformity of tests, but only commercially avail-able polymer types (i.e. polystyrene beads) with limited size and shape (i.e. sphere only) can be tested, whereas NPs in the environment will include many different polymers of varying size and shape. Manufactured NPs may behave differently from environmental NPs because of these different properties. Manufactured NPs come with additives, monomers or oligomers of the component molecules of the plastics, or come with dispersants that are either deliberately added or that are just by-products of the manufacture process. Polystyrene, for instance, release styrene 336 A.A. Koelmans et al.
monomers (Saido et al. 2014), which may add to the overall toxicity. If desired, 
such hydrophobic chemicals may be extracted from NP dispersions prior to test-ing, for instance using sequential Empore disk extractions (Koelmans et al. 2010). Commercial NPs are often delivered with a biocide to prevent bacterial growth during delivery and storage, which makes them useless for NP toxicity testing. Dispersants such as the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) are often used. Although this helps to keep the NPs freely dispersed, dispersant concentrations should be kept far below toxicity thresholds and they should be included in the controls (Handy et al. 2012). Alternatively, the NPs can be dialysed towards clean water in order to reduce the concentrations of unwanted chemicals (e.g. Cedervall et al. 2012). NP surfaces are sometimes modified (functionalized) to maximize dispersion of otherwise hydrophobic NPs. This further raises the question what relevant exposure conditions are. On the one hand, a free dispersion may be pre-ferred to achieve the level of control and constant nominal exposure concentration required from a regulatory perspective, and to obtain comparability of test results. On the other hand, a realistic test might aim at mimicking natural conditions as closely as possible, allowing for the formation of aggregates. All effect studies discussed in the previous section report the initial use of freely dispersed pristine NPs, yet acknowledge aggregate formation later on. This implies that aggregate formation and aggregate properties should be monitored during the tests. Several other challenges relating to the nanoscale of the particles are similar to those that were previously discussed for non-polymer manufactured nanomaterials (see Handy et al. 2012).
12.6  Implications and Recommendations
To date, the occurrence of NPs in the aquatic environment has not been proven and thus has to be considered a plausible hypothesis. Using manufactured NPs, some first effect tests have shown ingestion as well as negative effects of NPs on freshwater as well as marine species. Still, the toxicity thresholds seem higher than concentrations that are expected in the environment based on a worst-case assumption of conservative breakdown of microplastics present at currently known concentrations. However, we argue that potential impacts of NPs should not be considered in isolation. NPs might constitute an ecological stressor that adds to many other anthropogenic stressors such as trace metals, organic contaminants and non-polymer nanomaterials. Consequently, the question arises what contribution NPs make to the existing pool of other nano-sized materials. Natural nanoparticles have been shown to be ubiquitous in the environment, including hazardous ones (Wiesner et al. 2011). It has been suggested that engineered nanoparticles may account for only a negligible contribution to the concentrations of natural nanopar -
ticles including soots, clays or other colloids that are already present (Koelmans et al. 2009). Future research may primarily focus on the sources, formation rates and exposure levels of NPs and on the fate of the particles in aquatic systems. 337
12 Nanoplastics in the Aquatic Environment. Critical Review
Methods to detect NPs in drinking and in natural waters are urgently needed. 
Prognostic screening-level effects tests may be performed in order to quantify the hazard once environmental concentrations are known. This research would ben-efit enormously from harmonisation and uniformity in classification of NPs and in methodologies used.

M. Bergmann et al. (eds.), Marine Anthropogenic Litter,  DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-16510-3_13Abstract Plastics are highly versatile materials that have brought huge  societal 
benefits. They can be manufactured at low cost and their lightweight and  
adaptable nature has a myriad of applications in all aspects of everyday life, 
 including food packaging, consumer products, medical devices and construction. 
By 2050, however, it is anticipated that an extra 33 billion tonnes of plastic will be added to the planet. Given that most currently used plastic polymers are highly resistant to degradation, this influx of persistent, complex materials is a risk to human and environmental health. Continuous daily interaction with plastic items allows oral, dermal and inhalation exposure to chemical components, leading to the widespread presence in the human body of chemicals associated with plas-tics. Indiscriminate disposal places a huge burden on waste management systems, allowing plastic wastes to infiltrate ecosystems, with the potential to contaminate the food chain. Of particular concern has been the reported presence of micro-scopic plastic debris, or microplastics (debris ≤1 mm in size), in aquatic, terres-trial and marine habitats. Yet, the potential for microplastics and nanoplastics of environmental origin to cause harm to human health remains understudied. In this article, some of the most widely encountered plastics in everyday use are identi-fied and their potential hazards listed. Different routes of exposure to human popu-lations, both of plastic additives, microplastics and nanoplastics from food items and from discarded debris are discussed. Risks associated with plastics and addi-tives considered to be of most concern for human health are identified. Finally, some recent developments in delivering a new generation of safer, more sustain-able polymers are considered.

13.1  Introduction
If a visitor from 50 years ago were to turn up today, one of the first things he 
would notice (other than how much heavier we all were), would be how much plastic there is everywhere. We use plastics to wrap our food, we drink from  plastic containers, cook with plastic utensils, deliver drugs to patients through 
plastic tubing. We increasingly use plastics and polymer composites in construc-tion. Worldwide annual production of plastics is estimated to be in the region of 300 million tonnes. Plastic demand in the European Union alone for 2010 was estimated at 46.4 million tonnes, consisting of two main types: plastics used for packaging of food and consumer items, with the second group constituting plastics used in the construction industry (PlasticsEurope 2013). With overall recycling rates at around 57.9 %, this corresponds to around 24.7 million tonnes of plas-tic debris entering the waste stream each year. Waste disposal includes littering, land fill and the sewerage system and ultimately, a significant proportion of plastic waste ends up in the sea. Jambeck et al. (2015) estimated that 4.8 to 12.7 million tonnes of plastic waste entered the ocean in 2010.
Whilst these figures are alarming in terms of volume, it is not yet clear how this 
large scale and ubiquitous use affects human health. As an example, some 14.5 million tonnes per annum of plastic is used in the food packaging industry alone (European Plastics Converters). On the positive side, improvements in food packaging can pre-vent bacterial infections, such as Salmonella and other food borne disease (Hanning et al. 2009; European Commission 2014), and can prevent wastage and aid distribu-tion. Conversely, migration of contaminants from food packaging into food is consid-ered the main route of exposure of human populations to contaminants associated with plastics (Grob et al. 2006), with only a small fraction of the thousands of substances that may be present having been subject to extensive testing (Claudio 2012). Whilst rigorous standards are in place to regulate food-contact substances in terms of migra-tion into food (EFSA 2011), it is less clear how these guidelines offer protection once the plastics themselves have been discarded to the environment. With only limited information available about rates of degradation and fragmentation, leaching of chemi-cals into environmental matrices, and entry into the food chain, it is almost  impossible 
to estimate the cumulative risks of chronic exposure to plastics and their additives.
One way around this problem is to determine what chemicals are actually pre-
sent in the human body. Human biomonitoring involves measuring the concen-
trations of environmental contaminants and/or their metabolites in human tissues or body fluids, such as blood, breast milk, saliva or urine. Biomonitoring is con-sidered a gold standard in assessing the health risks of environmental exposures because it can provide an integrated measure of an individual’s exposure to con-taminants from multiple sources (Sexton et al. 2004). This approach has shown that chemicals used in the manufacture of plastics are certainly present in the human population. For some chemicals, their widespread presence in the general population at concentrations capable of causing harm in animal models has raised public health concerns (Talsness et al. 2009; Melzer and Galloway 2010). The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program of 345
studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children 
in the United States and represents one of the most comprehensive human bio-monitoring programs yet undertaken (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm). Of  
interest for this article, NHANES reports on several chemicals associated with the use or production of plastics, including bisphenol A, phthalates, styrene, acryla-mide, triclosan and brominated flame retardants, and their concentrations in the general population.
This review considers the kinds of plastics in widespread, everyday use and 
the potential hazards they may cause. It reviews the routes of uptake of micro and nanoplastics into humans through the food chain and the potential consequences for human health. Health risks associated with microplastics and plastic-associated chemicals are discussed. Lastly, some new developments in alternative low toxic-ity polymers and novel nanocomposite materials are described and their potential benefits to human health discussed.
13.2  What Kinds of Plastics Are in Use?
The term plastic is used to describe plastic polymers, to which various additives are added to give desirable properties to the final product (OECD 2004). The  
demand for plastics in Europe alone is estimated to be 45.9 million tonnes in 2012 (PlasticsEurope 2013), with plastics demand by industry segment shown  
in Table 13.1. As can be seen, packaging, which includes food and  beverage 
 packaging, is the single largest category by a considerable margin. Plastics  
are generally divided into two types: thermoplastic, which soften on heating  
and can be remoulded, and thermosetting, in which case cross-linking in the 
 polymers means they cannot be re-softened and remoulded. With reference to 
these properties, plastics can be further classified into seven different groupings based on their ease of recycling. Table 13.2 lists some examples of products made from these seven different plastics groups and the demand for different resin and polymer types based on this classification system (for Europe). As can be seen, the

main classification group (code 7) makes up 19.8 % of total European demand, yet 
has a 0 % recycling rate. The second most commonly used plastic, polypropylene (18.8 % of demand), has a 1 % recycling rate.
13.3  Plastics and Human Health
Plastic polymers are generally considered to be inert and of low concern to human health, and health risks relating to their use are attributed to the presence of the wide range of plastic additives they may contain, together with residual monomers that may be retained within the polymer structure (Araujo et al. 2002). Plastics are  synthesised from monomers, which are polymerised to form macromolecular chains. 
A range of additional chemicals may be added during the manufacturing process, including initiators, catalysts and solvents. Additives that can alter the nature of the Table 13.2  European plastic demand by resin type

final plastic include stabilisers, plasticisers, flame retardants, pigments and fillers. 
Additives are not bound to the polymer matrix and because of their low molecular weight, these substances can leach out of the plastic polymer (Crompton 2007) into the surrounding environment, including into air, water, food or body tissues.
There are thousands of additives in routine use in the synthesis of plastic prod-
ucts. As comprehensively reviewed by Lithner et al. (2011), certain plastics types typically contain more additives than other types. Polyvinylchloride (PVC) is the polymer associated with the use of most additives, including heat stabilisers to keep the polymer stable during production, and plasticisers such as phthalates to allow flexibility (Lithner et al. 2011). Plasticisers may constitute a high percentage (up 
to 80 %) of the weight of the final product (Buchta et al. 2005). Polypropylene is 
highly sensitive to oxidation and typically contains significant amounts of anti-oxidants and UV stabilisers (Zweifel 2001). Other chemicals that may leach from plastics include nonylphenol from polyolefins, brominated flame retardants from acrylonitrile-butadienestyrene (ABS) or urethane foam and bisphenol A (BPA) from polycarbonate. The rate at which these substances are released from the product is governed by many factors, including the size and volatility of the additive, the per -
meability of the polymer itself (migration is greater for highly permeable polymers), and the temperature and pH of the surrounding medium (air, water, soil, body tis-sues) (Zweifel 2001).
Plastics may also pose a hazard due to the release of the constituent monomers 
themselves (Lithner et al. 2011). Most of the plastics in everyday use are highly resistant to microbial degradation. Instead, degradation and release of polymers is ultimately caused by exposure to abiotic factors such as ultraviolet (UV) light, heat, mechanical and/or chemical abrasion (Andrady 2015). Breaking of the chem-ical bonds in the polymer backbone leads to chain scission and depolymerisation; chain stripping occurs when side chains are broken and released. All of these pro-cesses proceed at different rates under different environmental conditions, e.g. variations in temperature and oxygen, and proceed at different rates for differ -
ent polymer types, with polyesters, polycarbonate and polyurethane more prone to depolymerisation for example than polyethylene or polypropylene (Nicholson 1996; La Mantia 2002). It is therefore extremely difficult to predict the risks asso-ciated with exposure to plastics and their additives, given the vast complexity and variability of the available product combinations, their varied uses and eventual environmental distribution once discarded.
Lithner et al. (2011) addressed this complex problem by conducting a 
 comprehensive hazard ranking of plastic polymers based on their chemical com-
position. They studied 55 of the most widely used polymer types with global production volumes of >10,000 tonnes per year. A model for ranking the hazard of each polymer was developed by ranking the constituent monomer chemicals according to internationally agreed criteria for identifying physical, environ-ment and health risks. The polymer types that received the highest and the low-est hazard rankings according to this criteria are shown in Table 13.3. Table 13.4 
shows the ranking for polymer types commonly reported in plastic and micro-plastic litter.348 T.S. Galloway

hazard349 13 Micro- and Nano-plastics and Human Health 
As noted by the authors, the hazard ranking does not imply that the polymers 
themselves are hazardous, but rather that release of hazardous substances or deg-
radation products may occur during the product lifecycle, i.e. from production through use of the product and its eventual discard to waste or into the environ-ment. From this point of view, Table 13.3 also identifies polymers that may con-tain compounds that are currently the subject of biomonitoring activities under the NHANES program. Note that NHANES also monitors compounds that may be present in multiple, diverse items including many different types of plastics and plastics products, such as the microbial agent triclosan and the UV screen and printing ink additive benzophenone.
The polymers ranked as most hazardous were those produced from monomers 
classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic or both, leading to high hazard rankings for polyurethanes, polyvinylchloride, epoxy resins and styrenic polymers. One limita-tion of this approach noted by the authors was the lack of available chemical safety data for many of the substances they were considering. In particular, there was no hazard class available for chemicals suspected of being endocrine disruptors, including bisphenol A, phthalates, and epichlorohydrin. This toxicity endpoint was therefore not included in the hazard assessment. This represents a major limita-tion in our current ability to predict the risks associated with plastics associated chemicals, since so many of these are recognised to have endocrine disrupting abil-ities (Koch and Calafat 2009). Despite these limitations, this study represents an 
extremely useful attempt to identify those polymer types that could be a cause for concern due to the environmental and health effects of their constituent monomers.
13.4  Micro- and Nanoplastics
13.4.1  Occurrence of Micro- and Nanoplastics  
in the Environment
In addition to larger items of plastic litter, concern has been raised that micro-
scopic plastic debris (microplastic) (<1 mm) may also be detrimental to the environment and to human health (Thompson et al. 2004; Cole et al. 2011). Table 13.4  Plastics identified in microplastic debris and their relative hazard ranking

Microplastics have been studied mostly in the context of the marine environment, 
and have been found to be a major constituent of anthropogenic marine debris. They consist of small plastic items, such as exfoliates in cosmetics, or fragments from larger plastic debris, including polyester fibres from fabrics, polyethyl-ene fragments from plastic bags and polystyrene particles from buoys and floats (reviewed by Cole et al. 2011).
There is sparse information available on the presence of microplastics in 
environments other than the oceans, for example in terrestrial soils or freshwa-ter environments. The presence of microplastic particles (Dubaish and Liebezeit 2013) and synthetic polymer fibres (Zubris and Richards 2005) has been reported 
in sewage sludge and in the soils to which they had been applied (Zubris and Richards 2005), where they were still detectable five years after application. A 
study of surface waters in the southern North Sea found microplastics and micro-fibres in all of the samples that were tested, with an increasing gradient towards land sources (Dubaish and Leibezeit 2013). Browne et al. (2011) showed that the polyester and acrylic fibres used in clothing closely resembled those found in coastal sediments that receive sewage discharges, suggesting that sewage effluents represent a significant source of microfibres from the washing of clothes, and that these are not wholly retained during wastewater treatment.
A study of beach sediments around Lake Garda, a subalpine lake in Italy, found 
microplastics at abundances of up to 1108 ±  983 microplastic particles/m
2 (Imhof 
et al. 2013), which is similar to the contamination levels reported for the Great Lakes in the USA (Zbyszewski and Corcoran 2011). These levels of contamination most likely originate from landfill, litter and wastewater sources, and are within the range of values reported for the abundance of plastic particles found in marine coastal sedi-ments (0.21–77,000 particles/m
2), albeit at the lower end of exposures (Hidalgo-Ruz 
et al. 2012). This does, however, indicate that microplastics are present in both agri-cultural soils and freshwater sites. Knowledge on the occurrence of nanoplastics in aquatic environments and biota is extremely limited because no methods exist for the reliable detection of nanoplastics in samples (Koelmans et al. 2015).
13.4.2  Micro- and Nanoplastics and Human Health
In terms of human health risks, microplastics as contaminants in the wider environ-ment represent a concern because it has been shown that they can be ingested by a wide range of aquatic organisms, both marine and freshwater, and thus have the potential to accumulate through the food chain. Aquatic organisms for which inges-tion of microplastics has been documented in the field include those from across the marine food web, including turtles, seabirds, fish, crustaceans and worms (reviewed by Wright et al. 2013). Laboratory studies have confirmed that many other organ-isms have the capacity to ingest microplastics including zooplankton (Cole et al. 2013; Setälä et al. 2012). The majority of studies have documented microplastics in 
the guts of organisms, an organ that is not generally consumed directly by humans. 351 13 Micro- and Nano-plastics and Human Health 
Exceptions to this include shellfish such as mussels, clams and some shrimps that 
are eaten whole or with their gut. The risk of ingesting microplastics contained within other tissues depends on the degree to which uptake of microplastics and translocation and redistribution and retention within other body tissues occurs. This concept is discussed further below, in relation to human ingestion.
In addition to the potential for ingestion to cause adverse biological effects due 
to gut blockages and/or damage, or the reduction in energy assimilation (Wright et al. 2013), the large surface area of microplastics means that environmental pollut-ants may sorb to the surface of the particles, with the potential to be transferred into body tissues once ingested. For a more comprehensive coverage of the uptake of microplastics by wildlife organisms, and the transfer to tissues of hydrophobic pol-lutants adsorbed from the surrounding environment, the reader is referred to excel-lent recent reviews (e.g. Engler 2012) and to other chapters in this issue (Koelmans 2015; Lusher 2015). Despite this concern, there is currently no available information to evidence the uptake or biological effects of microplastics originating from marine or terrestrial debris and subsequently ingested by humans through the food chain.
13.4.3  Ingestion of Micro- and Nanoplastics  
and Uptake Across the Gut
Whilst the potential clearly exists for microplastics to be present in food items, 
there is currently no evidence for the unintentional ingestion or subsequent trans-location and uptake of microplastics into the human body through the diet. There is, however, a huge interest worldwide in the use of micro- and nanospheres as pharmaceutical drug delivery systems through oral, intravenous and transcutane-ous routes (Kim et al. 2010), and in the migration of nanopolymers from packag-ing materials into food (EFSA 2011; Lagaron and Lopez-Rubio 2011). Based on these growing and fast moving fields, an enhanced understanding of the mecha-nistic pathways by which micro- and nanoparticles could enter the human body is starting to emerge, although many aspects of this field remain to be elucidated.
Following oral ingestion, the gut mucosa represents an important barrier, which 
has evolved to allow efficient uptake of nutritious items, whilst excluding poten-tially harmful substances or organisms. Significant uptake of microplastics into the body through this route is in theory then limited to particles that can enter the body through exploitation of existing routes. Following oral ingestion, uptake of inert particles across the gut has been widely studied (O’Hagan 1996). The ‘persorption’ of starch particles as large as 150 μ m through the tips of the villi was described in 
detail by V olkheimer (1977). According to his observations, persorption of particles can occur as a passive process in areas of the gut where the intestinal mucosa is covered by a single layer of epithelium. Persorbed particles were detectable in the lumen of blood and lymph vessels within minutes, and were eventually eliminated in the urine, confirming that the translocation of relatively large, inert particles from the gut to other body fluids is possible (V olkheimer 1977).352 T.S. Galloway
Aside from this observation, digestive absorption of smaller particles proceeds 
through pinocytosis and vesicular phagocytic processes for materials in the nano 
and micron range. Particle size is one of the most important factors in determin-ing the extent and pathway of uptake. Smaller particles are generally favoured over larger ones. For example, polystyrene microspheres of 50–100 nm were more readily absorbed across the Peyer’s patches and the villi of the gut than larger  particles of 300–3000 nm (Jani et al. 1992; Florence and Hussain 2001). On the 
other hand, the uptake of ultrafine polylysine dendrimers of 2.5 nm was lower than that of larger polystyrene particles of 100 nm–3 µm, suggesting that size is not the only deciding factor (Florence et al. 2000). Indeed, a combination of size, surface charge and hydrophilicity all contribute to uptake affinity (as discussed by Awaad et al. 2012). The predominant site of uptake for micron-scale particles in the gut 
is reported to be through gut-associated lymphatic tissue (GALT), specifically by the Microfold (M) cells of the Peyer’s patches. M cells are specialised epithelial cells that lack the microvilli found on other gut epithelial cells and instead have broader (micro)folds and a thinner luminal surface that allows them to actively take up particulate matter from the intestine. The reported efficiency of this uptake var -
ies depending on the study method, species and particle type. Uptake of polystyrene microspheres through the gut by this route was higher in species such as rabbits, which have a high abundance of M cells (Pappo et al. 1989), and was enhanced 
when food was also present, probably due to the delayed transit time through the gut (Ebel 1990). As an alternative route, uptake by enterocytes appears to be lim-ited to a size range of around 100 nm (Jani et al. 1992). Awaad et al. (2012) used fluorescent organosilica particles, histological examination and quantitative analysis to confirm an optimal size range of around 100 nm for uptake of particles through the M cells of the Peyer’s patches, with smaller and larger particles less likely to be taken up. They also identified two alternative uptake pathways by which nano-particles passed between (paracellular-E uptake) or through (transcellular-E uptake) enterocytes in the Peyer’s patches. These two pathways have previously been described as major mechanisms for larger particles of >1 µm outside of the Peyer’s patches (Kreuter 1991), but had not previously been described in relation to nano-particle uptake by the Peyer’s patches.
Garrett et al. (2012) used a novel bio-imaging technique, multimodal non-
linear optical microscopy, to document uptake of polymeric nanoparticles by enterocytes in the mouse gut in vivo. They studied a novel amphipathic polymer specifically designed for drug delivery, ammonium palmitoyl glycol chitosan (GCPQ) of 30–50 nm in diameter and showed that after uptake by enterocytes, particles accumulated at the base of the villi. From there, they passed into the blood stream and were transported to the liver, where they were detectable in the hepatocytes and intracellular spaces, before recirculating through the bile to the small intestine (Garrett et al. 2012) to be excreted with faecal matter. This is  similar to previous results for larger micron-scale polystyrene and latex parti-
cles, suggesting that both micron and nano-scale polymers are treated in a similar manner (Jani et al. 1996), with uptake across the gut, recirculation and eventual elimination through faecal matter and urine (Fig. 13.1).353 13 Micro- and Nano-plastics and Human Health

This information is of high interest in terms of drug delivery, yet it also sug-
gests that ample opportunity exists, following ingestion, for micro- and nanoplas-
tics in food or water to enter, circulate and bioaccumulate within the body.
13.4.4  Interaction of Microspheres and Nanoparticles  
with Cells and Tissues
The behaviour of nano- and microplastics after they have entered the circulation 
from the gut is not fully understood, but has been the subject of study in relation to food packaging materials and nanomedicines. Certainly, in vivo behaviour will be dependent on numerous factors, such as the physico-chemical properties of the particles (size, surface charge, aspect ratio, porosity, surface corona) and the physiological state of the individual. Risk assessments of manufactured nanomate-rials including titanium dioxide (Wang et al. 2007) and carbon (Poland et al. 2008) 
have shown comparable results to those shown above for nanopolymers, with uptake across the gut into the circulation and redistribution to the liver and spleen. Circulation time is highly dependent on the surface characteristics of the particle, with hydrophilic and positively charged particles showing enhanced circulation times (Silvestre et al. 2011).
13.4.5  Interactions with Biological Materials and Cells
Interaction of nanopolymers with cells and tissues has again been the subject of intensive study. Because of their surface properties, nanopolymers are predicted to adsorb macromolecules such as proteins and lipids from the surrounding body fluids onto their surface, in a process influenced by surface energy, charge and spe-cific affinity for certain biomolecules. The resulting ‘corona’ will then influence the resulting behaviour and toxicity of the particle (Lundqvist et al. 2008; Tenzer et al. 2013). This process has been extensively studied for polymers intended for therapeutic use particularly using polystyrene as a model polymer, but little or nothing is known of how protein coronas may form on the types of polymers most commonly found in environmental debris.
The results from mechanistic studies of different types of particle show that 
the potential for cytotoxicity of circulating particles in vivo to cells and tissues is related to many factors, including size, shape, solubility, surface charge, surface reactivity and energy band structure (Nel et al. 2006; Burello and Worth 2011). 
For example, it would be reasonable to hypothesize that particles with a high abundance of reactive surface groups would be capable of denaturing surround-ing lipids and proteins. As an illustration of this, the toxicity of silica nanoparti-cles in vivo was attributed to proton donating silanol groups on the surface of the 355 13 Micro- and Nano-plastics and Human Health 
particles, leading to denaturation of membrane proteins and subsequent membrane 
damage. In this case, the reactivity of the surface hydrogen of silica bonds with membrane proteins led to their abstraction from the membrane, with subsequent membrane damage and distortion leading to haemolytic symptoms following exposure (Pandurangi et al. 1990).
Surface charge is also a strong attributing factor for toxicity (Geys et al. 2008). 
In inhalation studies in rats, the toxicity of acrylic ester nanopolymers in the size range 50–1500 nm was found to be low, and this was attributed to their anionic surface charge (Ma-Hock et al. 2012). Studies in which the surface charge of 
stearylamine-polylactic acid (PLA) polymers was modified from positive to nega-tive showed that cationic particles showed higher pulmonary toxicity (Harush-Frenkel et al. 2010). This was attributed both to a higher localisation of cationic particles in the lung and to enhanced cellular uptake. Overall, the interaction of cationic polymers with the negatively charged cell surface has been proposed as a cause of their higher cytotoxicity (Fischer et al. 2003).
Translocation of nanopolymers into diverse tissues and cell types presents 
another point at which toxicity may occur. Translocation is dependent on inter -
actions with the cell membrane and is most likely to proceed, as for uptake by enterocytes in the gut, through pinocytic, phagocytic and receptor-mediated endocytosis (Fruijter-Polloth 2012). A study, which measured the uptake rates of individual polystyrene microspheres into human astrocytes and lung carcinoma cells in culture found that the uptake rate differed for particles of different sizes, implying that there are differences in the mechanisms involved. Particles with a diameter of 40 nm showed higher uptake rates than either 20 or 100 nm particles. 
Since the van der Waals force between a sphere and a surface is proportional to the diameter of the sphere (Israelachvili 1992), it could be predicted that larger parti-cles would be taken up faster. The conclusion was that the endocytic mechanism for internalisation of 40 nm particles exhibited faster kinetics, providing a privi-leged size gap for 40 nm particles (Varela et al. 2012).
Phagosomes containing particles may fuse with endosomes following inter -
nalisation, leading to accumulation of particles in lysosomes. Depending on the dose and type of particle, this has the potential to overwhelm lysosomal  capacity 
and interfere with programmed cell death and pathways of cellular breakdown of 
pathogens (Fruijter-Polloth 2012). The numerous additional modes of toxicity that  
may result are again dependent on particle and cell type, and include the poten-tial for oxidative damage, inflammation and accumulation in diverse tissue types (Silvestre et al. 2011; Nel et al. 2006, 2009). In theory, all organs may be at risk 
following chronic exposure to nanopolymers, including the brain, testis and repro-ductive organs, prior to their eventual excretion in urine and faeces (Jani et al. 1996;  
Garrett et al. 2012). Distribution to the foetus in utero is also a possibility that  
cannot be excluded. Given the long-term persistence of many polymer types, more research is required to adequately assess the risks that accumulation of micro- and nanoplastics in the body may pose.356 T.S. Galloway
13.5  Assessing the Risks that Micro- and Nanoplastics  
Pose to Human Health
13.5.1  Leaching of Toxic Chemicals from Plastics
As discussed previously, plastics can contain complex mixtures of additives to 
enhance their physical properties, which can leach from the polymer into the sur -
rounding milieu. Leaching will occur primarily at the surface of the plastic par -
ticle, with the possibility of constant diffusion of chemicals from the core of the particle to the surface. Thus, leaching from plastic particles could present a long-term source of chemicals into tissues and body fluids, despite the fact that many of these chemicals are not persistent and have short half lives in the body (Engler 2012). Plastics additives of concern to human health include phthalates, bisphenol A, brominated flame retardants, triclosan, bisphenone and organotins.
The potential migration of polymer constituents and additives into food and 
drinks is considered to be a major route of exposure of the human population and as might be expected is subject to extensive legislation. The measurement of migration levels is typically estimated from measurements using different sol-vents to simulate the receiving environment (e.g. foodstuffs), or can be estimated using partitioning models that consider aspects including the desportion rates from the polymers, dimensions of the polymer framework and dimensions of the dif-fusing molecules (Helmroth et al. 2002). The European Food Standards Agency has a total migration limit of 10 mg/dm
2 for additives within plastics intended for 
packaging use, with a more stringent migration limit of 0.01 mg/kg for certain chemicals of concern (Commission Directive 2007/19/CE that modifies Directive 2002/72/CE). This means that for an average 60 kg adult who consumes 3 kg of foods and liquids per day, exposures to individual substances from food packaging could be up to 250 μg/kg body weight per day (Muncke 2011).
13.5.2  Bisphenol a and Human Health
There is very little information on the leaching of additives into biological tissues directly, but one chemical monomer that has received considerable attention in rela-tion to its human health effects is bisphenol A (Fig. 13.2). Bisphenol A (BPA) was first synthesised in the 1930s as a synthetic estrogen (Dodds and Lawson 1936) and is now a high-production volume chemical used as a monomer in the production of polycarbonate plastic and in the epoxy resins lining food and beverage cans. There are numerous studies showing that BPA can migrate out of polycarbonate (reviewed 
Fig. 13.2  Bisphenol A CH3
CH3OH HO357 13 Micro- and Nano-plastics and Human Health 
in Guart et al. 2013) and contaminate foodstuffs and drinks, and oral ingestion 
is considered the major route of exposure of the human population (Calafat et al 2008). Additional routes of exposure are predicted from the inhalation of household dusts and dermal uptake from printed materials (Ehrlich et al. 2014). BPA undoubt-
edly enters the human body, with studies showing exposure of >95 % of popula-tions in USA, Europe and Asia (Galloway et al. 2010; Vandenberg et al. 2010).
Bisphenol A exerts its biological activity predominantly through interaction with 
steroid hormone receptors, showing both estrogenic and antiandrogenic activity and suppressing aromatase activity (Bonefeld-Jørgensen et al. 2007, Lee et al 2003). Additional receptor-mediated effects reported in various model systems include binding to the orphan estrogen-related receptor ERRα  (Okada et al. 2008), thyroid 
hormone disruption (Moriyama et al. 2002), altered pancreatic beta cell function (Ropero et al. 2008) and obesity promoting effects (Newbold et al. 2008). There is growing evidence from epidemiological and laboratory studies that exposure to BPA at levels found in the general population, around 0.2–20 ng/ml (values given for urinary BPA), is associated with adverse human health effects, including the onset of obesity and cardiovascular disease (Lang et al. 2008; Melzer et al. 2010, 
2012; Cipelli et al. 2013) and with numerous reproductive and developmental out-comes. These include increases in abnormal penile/urethra development in males, an increase in hormonally-mediated cancers including breast and prostate cancers, neurobehavioural disorders including autism and early sexual maturation in females (reviewed by vom Saal et al. 2007; Hengstler et al. 2011; Rochester 2013).
Whether the release of BPA from ingested micro- or nanoplastics directly into 
the body contributes to human exposure remains unknown. The current tolerable daily intake is 0.05 mg/kg/day (EFSA 2006) and compared with this, the median exposure of the general adult population globally has been estimated from human biomonitoring or urinary BPA to be 0.01–0.12 μ g/kg/day (EFSA 2015). The 
 concentrations of BPA in plasma are higher than would be predicted only from 
this level of exposure to BPA through food and drink (Mielke and Gundert-Remy 2009), and it is therefore plausible that other routes of exposure could occur, e.g. from ingestion of plastic particles containing BPA, which subsequently leaches into tissues. BPA can certainly be absorbed across body surfaces other than the gut. Gayrard et al. (2013) showed that BPA can be absorbed with relatively high  efficiency sublingually, an effect likely enhanced by its low molecular weight and 
moderate water solubility, allowing it to penetrate the sublingual membrane.
There are no studies in humans of the transfer of BPA from plastic directly 
into tissues, but the potential for BPA to leach from ingested polycarbonate into aquatic species was explored by Koelmans et al. (2014) who used biodynamic modeling to calculate the relative contribution of plastic ingestion to total expo-sure to chemicals residing in the ingested plastic. They estimated plastic:lipid exchange coefficients for a range of plastic particle sizes for two species, fish and sediment-dwelling worms. They proposed that a continuous ingestion of plastic containing 100 mg/kg BPA would lead to a very low steady-state concentration of 0.044 ng/kg BPA in fish and 60 μg/kg (normalized to lipid) in worms. Whilst this represents a substantial exposure pathway, the risk of exposure through this route 358 T.S. Galloway
was considered low in comparison with other pathways of exposure, based on the 
reported abundance of microplastics.
13.5.3  Safer Alternatives to BPA
Concern over exposure to BPA and its potential to cause harmful effects has led to worldwide efforts to formulate alternative polymer materials. This is a techni-cally challenging area, largely because polycarbonate is such a useful material. It is an optically clear, strong and heat resistant plastic and hence has a wide range of uses. One promising formulation is a copolyester called Tritan
TM, which contains 
three different monomers, dimethyl terephthalate, cyclohexane dimethanol and tetramethyl cyclobutanediol (Eastman 2010). Studies have shown that it has a low migration potential, both for its constituent monomers and for the additives that are present in the polymer matrix. More importantly, the constituents and the lea-cheates from the polymer showed neither hormonal nor toxic activity. In a study by Guart et al. (2013), the leacheate from Tritan
TM and from polycarbonate bot-
tles into water was collected and tested in a number of in vitro bioassays, includ-ing for estrogenic, (anti) androgenic activity and for retinoic acid and vitamin D type activities. The Tritan
TM leacheates showed no activity at any concentration, 
whereas the leacheate from polycarbonate showed estrogenic and antiandrogenic activity at higher concentrations (Guart et al. 2013). These findings are interesting, 
as they show the potential for newer, safer polymer alternatives to reduce unin-tended exposure of the human population.
13.5.4  Novel Polymer Formulations
In assessing the physical risks posed by ingestion of nano- or microplastics that unintentionally enter the food chain, much information and guidance can be gained from existing risk assessments performed for food packaging. For exam-ple, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has produced detailed guidance for assessing the risks of exposure to nanomaterials, including nanocomposites, biopolymers and other complex materials, from their applications in the food chain (EFSA 2011). As detailed by EFSA, there are huge uncertainties that are associated with detecting, identifying and characterising different micro-, and nan-oparticles and polymers in complex matrices such as food, even when the likely constituent substances are known, and these problems are multiplied where rates and sources of contamination remain unknown. In general, however, the consid-erations suggested by EFSA provide a useful framework applicable to the risks posed by microplastics and nanoplastics as contaminants in food.
Based on the guidance provided by EFSA, it can be predicted that the risks 
posed by micro- or nanopolymers to human health will be determined by the 359 13 Micro- and Nano-plastics and Human Health 
chemical composition and physico-chemical properties of the particles them-
selves, their potential for uptake and interactions with tissues, and the likely potential exposure levels. Actual information on migration rates of nanoparticles into food or food stimulants is sparse. Simon et al. (2008) derived a theoretical model to estimate migration rates of nanoparticles from a polymer matrix. The model predicted that migration from polymers of low dynamic viscosity would be limited to particles of <1 nm in diameter, even where the interaction between particle and polymer was negligible. These estimates are in accord with results from Schmidt et al. (2009) who used a combination of field flow fractionation and analytical chemistry techniques to study the migration of nanoparticles out of polylactic acid (PLA). Whilst migration out of the matrix did definitely occur, the resulting nanoparticle concentrations were well below the recommended migra-tion limits. Migration may also be higher into acidic matrices (Mauricio-Inglesias et al. 2010). Table 13.5 compiles some of the indicators identified by EFSA to 
have the potential to lead to toxicity following uptake of nanoparticles in the diet. These include high levels of reactivity, complex morphologies, the ability to inter -
act with biomolecules, stability and presence of toxic additives. Accordingly, one might expect the greatest hazard to human health to come from ingestion of com-plex, high aspect ratio nano-scale fibres, synthesised from mixed substances of variable persistence.
13.5.5  Nanopolymers and Nanofillers
There are many technological advances in the development of complex bio-composites and nanopolymers that are relevant for consideration here. Nanocomposites are complex macromolecular materials containing small quanti-ties of nanoscale additives, or nanofillers. The most commonly employed nano-fillers for food packaging (the most common type of plastic litter) are nanoclays. Other common nanofillers include nanocellulose fibres, carbon nanotubes, metals and oxides. Nanofillers are intended to enhance or improve the inherent proper -
ties of the polymer, including factors such as mechanical strength, thermal and  ultraviolet stability, and gas and vapour barrier properties (Lagaron and Lopez-
Rubio 2011). The high surface-to-volume ratio of nanofillers enhances their inher -
ent chemical and mechanical properties compared with larger-scale versions of the same material, whilst allowing them to disperse within polymers without introduc-ing structural defects. For example, addition of nanoclays can enhance the oxygen barrier properties of plastics, which makes them particularly attractive for keeping food from spoiling (Lagaron and Lopez-Rubio 2011).
The addition of nanomaterials into polymers can also cut down on the need for 
large amounts of additives, for example by acting as antioxidants or  antimicrobial 
agents themselves (De Azedero 2013). In relation to plastic discarded to the envi-ronment, a major added benefit of nanofillers is that they may also be able to reduce the unintended migration of additives out of polymers (de Abreu et al. 2010).  360 T.S. Galloway
The migration of various polymer additives, including triclosan and diphenyl 
 butadiene from polyamide into food stimulants was found to be up to six times lower 
when nanoclays were added to the polyamide. The nanoclay particles were thought to slow down the rate of migration of the additives due to their layering within the  
polymer matrix, creating a tortuosity effect (Fig. 13.3) (de Abreu et al. 2010). Thus, new advances in nanotechnology may bring unintended benefits in terms of the reduced leaching of their additives and hence the environmental safety of the poly-mers that contain them.Table 13.5  Indicators of potential toxicity for nanoparticles contained within food packaging

361 13 Micro- and Nano-plastics and Human Health 
13.6  Conclusions and Future Work
This short account has identified some of the most widely encountered plastics in 
everyday use and illustrated some of the attempts that have been made to assess their potential hazards to human health. Different routes of exposure to human populations, both of plastic additives, micro- and nanoplastics from food items and from discarded debris are discussed in relation to the existing literature for  nanomedicines and nanocomposite packaging materials, for which an increasing 
body of knowledge exists. It is clear that our understanding of the potential con-tamination of the human population by micro- or nanoplastics sourced from the environment is in its infancy, leaving many questions unanswered:
•	Does significant bioaccumulation and trophic transfer for micro- and nanoplas-
tics occur in the environment? If so, what species are most at risk?
•	How does ageing of plastics affect their physico-chemical properties and subse-quent toxicity?
•	Following ingestion, does uptake of micro- and nanoplastics occur? Do pro-teins bind to the surface of the particles to form a protein corona? How does this vary for different plastic litter types and what cell types are most vulnerable to toxicity?
•	What methods should we be using for locating, identifying and quantify-ing micro- and nanoplastics in complex matrices including biological tissues? Techniques mentioned in this chapter include field flow fractionation, multi-angled light scattering (MALS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and non-linear optical bioimaging. Further development of suitable methods for extracting micro- and nanoplastics from biological materials and for studying them in situ remains a compelling research gap for the future.

M. Bergmann et al. (eds.), Marine Anthropogenic Litter,  DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-16510-3_14Abstract This chapter aims to provide an overview of research into quantifying 
the economic impacts of marine litter. From an environmental economics perspec-
tive it introduces the difficulties in measuring the economic costs of marine litter; reviews those sectors where these costs are notable; and considers policy instru-ments, which can reduce these costs. Marine litter is underpinned by dynamic and complex processes, the drivers and impacts of which are multi-scalar, trans-boundary, and play out in both marine and terrestrial environments. These impacts include economic costs to expenditure, welfare and lost revenue. In most cases, these are not borne by the producers or the polluters. In industries such as fisher -
ies and tourism the costs of marine litter are beginning to be quantified and are considerable. In other areas such as impacts on human health, or more intangible costs related to reduced ecosystem services, more research is evidently needed. As the costs of marine litter are most often used to cover removing debris or recov-ering from the damage which they have caused, this expenditure represents treat-ment rather than cure, and although probably cheaper than inaction do not present a strategy for cost reduction. Economic instruments, such as taxes and charges addressing the drivers of waste, for instance those being developed for plastic bags, could be used to reduce the production of marine litter and minimise its impacts. In any case, there remain big gaps in our understanding of the harm caused by marine litter, which presents difficulties when attempting to both quantify its economic costs, and develop effective and efficient instruments to reduce them.

14.1  Introduction
In addition to the environmental and health issues discussed in previous book sec-
tions (Galloway 2015; Kühn et al. 2015), marine litter can cause a range of eco-nomic impacts that both increase the costs associated with marine and coastal activities, and reduce the economic benefits derived from them. This chapter aims to provide an overview of the results of research performed to date, which has attempted to quantify the economic impact of marine litter. It provides a brief analysis of the marine litter problem from an environmental economics perspec-tive, and discusses the use and design of economic-based policy instruments to tackle the problem.
14.2  Estimating the Economic Impacts of Marine Litter
Measuring the full economic cost of marine litter is complex due to the wide range of economic, social and environmental impacts, the range of sectors impacted by marine litter and the geographic spread of those affected. Some of the impacts are easier to evaluate in economic terms because they are more direct, such as increased marine litter cleaning costs. Others are more complex, for example, the less direct and/or more intangible values such as the impacts of ecosystem deterio-ration or reductions in quality of life. Furthermore, the spatial and temporal com-plexity of the impacts related to marine litter result in costs, which may not always be immediate or conspicuous but are nevertheless significant for sustainability (National Research Council 2008). As regards ecosystem degradation, it is useful to differentiate between impacts on biodiversity (species and habitats) and the impact on the ecosystem services flowing from the ecosystem (e.g. provisioning services such as food provision, regulating services such as water and waste purification; and cultural services such as tourism and recreation). As regards economic costs it is important to differentiate between actual economic costs linked to expenditure (e.g. costs of cleanup of beaches; costs associated with damage to or loss of fishing gear or obstruction of motors; eventual cost of hospitalisation from marine debris related health impacts), economic costs of loss of output or revenue (e.g. loss of revenue from fish or loss of income from tourism) and assessment of welfare costs in economic terms (e.g. health impacts from marine debris; assessing the economic value of loss of cultural values such as recreation or landscape aesthetics).
While marine litter has become an increasingly important issue in policy dis-
cussions, there is only a very sketchy (albeit growing) body of knowledge on the costs of the impacts. Because of a lack of recording even the direct economic costs of marine litter tend not to be measured (Mouat et al. 2010). Furthermore, even though there is a growing interest in ecosystem services (Costanza et al. 1997; MA 2005; TEEB 2010, 2011) little research has been done to date on the economic 
cost of marine litter on ecosystem service provision. Having said this, evaluations 369 14 The Economics of Marine Litter
of marine ecosystem services, which are estimated at €16.5 trillion in one study 
(Costanza et al. 1997), suggest that even fractional deterioration in provision would represent a significant cost (Beaumont et al. 2007; Galparsoro et al. 2014).
Thus far, studies undertaken to estimate the economic impacts of marine litter 
have generally focused on the direct losses borne by economic activities adversely affected by the presence of marine litter in the environment, within which they operate and rely upon (see Hall 2000; Mouat et al. 2010; MacFayden 2009; McIlgorm et al. 2011). Largely, such studies have not taken into account the often intangible costs of any social and ecological impacts. Some early studies allude to the need for research to explore these costs. For instance, Kirkley and McConnell (1997, p. 185) call for strategies, which account for the economics related to lost ecological functions driven by marine litter. The intricacy of developing such  strategies can be illustrated with the example of alien invasive species. Marine 
litter provides additional opportunities for marine organisms to travel (including alien invasive species) up to threefold (Barnes 2002). Given that the  introduction 
of alien invasive species can have a detrimental impact on marine ecosystems and biodiversity (Kiessling et al. 2015) and can result in serious economic losses to many marine industries, any estimates, which exclude such ecological impacts, will inevitably fall seriously short of the true cost of the marine litter problem. For example, the introduction of the carpet sea squirt (Didemnum vexillum) in Holyhead Harbour (Wales, U.K.) resulted in an eradication and monitoring  program over a decade starting in 2009, which was expected to cost €670,000. 
This expenditure was economically justified as allowing the species to spread unpredated and smother organisms and marine habitats would have cost the local mussel fisheries up to €8.6 million alone over 10 years (Holt 2009). Goldstein 
et al. (2014) recorded the ciliate pathogen Halofolliculina (known to cause skeletal eroding band disease in corals) on floating plastic debris in the western Pacific and suggested that the spread of the disease to Caribbean and Hawaiian corals may be due to rafting on the enormous quantities of litter reported from the area. Increased coral mortality or the introduction of other pathogens via floating marine debris may lead to economic costs, for example through decreased revenues due to fall-ing numbers of visiting tourists.
Despite their partial coverage, the studies that are available provide sufficient 
information to draw a number of important conclusions. The main economic sec-tors, which have been identified from the literature as being affected by marine litter are agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries, commercial shipping and  recreational 
boating, coastal municipalities, coastal tourism sector and the emergency rescue services (Hall 2000; Mouat et al. 2010). The economic impacts affecting these  
sectors are described and quantified where possible (Hall 2000; Mouat et al. 2010; McIlgorm et al. 2011; Jang et al., 2014; Antonelis 2011). They also make attempts 
at aggregating economic impacts across sectors to provide regional cost estimates. Mouat et al. (2010) provide an estimate of marine litter costs for the Shetland (U.K.) economy, of € 1–1.1 million on average per year, an estimate, which con-
sists of actual expenditures and, in some cases, estimated lost income. This is only a single case study, and the sectors affected on Shetland would be affected to 370 S. Newman et al.
varying degrees in other coastal areas. However, these findings clearly demonstrate 
that the economic impact of marine litter on coastal communities can be extremely high. McIlgorm et al. (2011) calculated the costs of marine litter for 21 econo-mies in the Asia-Pacific region. Similarly to Hall (2000) and Mouat et al. (2010), they consisted of such losses as those from entangled ship propellers, lost fishing time, and tourism losses from deterring visitors, but not the cost of any harm to ecosystem services or other non-market values (McIlgorm et al. 2011). In total, McIlgorm et al. (2011) estimated the cost of marine litter in the Asia-Pacific region to be in the region of € 1 billion per year to marine industries, equivalent to 0.3 % 
of the gross domestic product for the marine sector of the region.
14.2.1  Beach Cleaning, Tourism and Recreation
Coastal municipalities are impacted economically by marine litter primarily through the direct cost of keeping beaches clear of litter and its wider implications for tourism and recreation. Direct costs include the collection, transportation and disposal of litter, and administrative costs such as contract management. Ensuring that beaches are clean, attractive and safe for visitors is prioritised by municipali-ties when the economic case for protecting the local economy and tourism indus-try justifies the costs of removing the litter. In areas where coastlines make a significant contribution to the economy, the costs incurred through marine litter can be substantial.
In the U.K., the cost of removing beach litter to all coastal municipalities is 
estimated to be in the region of €18–19 million (Mouat et al. 2010). This equates to an average cost per municipality of €146,000 (Mouat et al. 2010). The majority 
of this cost was accounted for by labor costs. Mouat et al. (2010) also calculated 
the cost annually per km of coastline. Although the average cost of litter removal was between €7,000 and €7,300 per km per year, there was a lot of variation, with costs ranging from €171 to €82,000 per km per year (Mouat et al. 2010). Higher costs correlated with more intense cleaning operations on small areas of coast-line, particularly in tourist areas. In Belgium and The Netherlands, the total cost of beach litter removal was estimated to be €10.4 million per year, at an average of €200,000 per municipality per year (Mouat et al. 2010). Per km, the cleaning costs came to €34,000 per year on average, again with great variation (e.g. from €600 to €97,300 in Den Haag) (Mouat et al. 2010). This average is much greater than 
that in the U.K. as municipalities in Belgium and The Netherlands removed litter from a much higher proportion of their coastline (because it is more densely popu-lated). The great variation in amounts spent by municipalities on different beaches reflects the variation in importance of different stretches of coastline to the tourism industry. Of course many areas of coastline worldwide do not have anything spent on them to provide a litter cleanup service.
It is important to recognize, however, that beach cleaning is not necessarily 
performed by municipalities alone, and that voluntary organisations tend to play 371 14 The Economics of Marine Litter
a large role in removing litter (see Hidalgo-Ruz and Thiel 2015). This is an eco-
nomic impact on society that comprises operational expenditure, financial assis-tance or some sort of ‘in kind’ assistance such as materials or insurance, and the value of volunteers’ time. There may also be an opportunity cost where volunteer time could be spent servicing the community in other ways. Mouat et al. (2010) estimated the value of volunteers’ time in two annual beach clean operations in the U.K. at which a substantial quantity of litter from the U.K. coastline was collected, to be around €131,000. As this estimate includes neither financial assistance nor operational management costs, it is likely to be a substantial underestimate.
In coastal municipalities, particularly those where beaches contribute signif-
icantly to the local economy, the indirect economic impacts of marine litter are more important. A few studies have attempted to calculate the costs incurred to coastal areas as a result of marine litter. Jang et al. (2014) considered the economic 
impact of a single marine litter event in South Korea, in which heavy rainfall resulted in an unusually high level of marine litter to be washed on the beaches of Goeje Island, a popular tourist destination. Based on government figures and a number of surveys they assessed multiple economic effects of marine litter such as lost expenditure on hotels and lodging, which could be influenced by marine litter. Lost expenditure was expressed as the product of decreased visitors and average visitor expenditure, in this case between €23 and €29 million of lost revenue in 2011 compared to 2010, as a result of over 500,000 fewer visitors to the island. In 2013, a study of 31 beaches in Orange County (California, USA) considered how marine debris influences their decision to go to the beach, and at what expense (Leggett et al. 2014). It applied the travel cost model, which estimates the value people derive from recreation at a particular site based on the utility they expect to experience in relation to alternative sites. They showed that marine debris had a significant impact on residents’ beach choices, and that a 75 % reduction in marine litter at six popular beaches generated over €40 million in additional benefits to Orange County residents over just 3 months. These two studies clearly demon-strate the value people place in the clean marine and coastal environments and the potential for costs to communities, which derive utility for the services which these environments provide. This is an interesting finding given that many of these visitors may also be responsible for some of the pollution, by littering during their beach visits, for example.
14.2.2  Shipping and Yachting
The shipping and yachting industries also experience economic impacts as a result of marine litter pollution, with harbors and marinas incurring the cost of remov-ing marine litter from their facilities in order to keep them safe and attractive to users, and vessels experiencing interference with propellers, anchors, rudders and blocked intake pipes and valves (Mouat et al. 2010). On occasion, some of these 372 S. Newman et al.
vessel encounters pose navigational hazards that require the rescue services to 
become involved, thereby increasing costs dramatically.
Mouat et al. (2010) estimated that removing marine litter costs U.K. ports  
and harbors on average €2.4 million per year. But this can range from €0 (as not all harbors surveyed in this study took action to remove marine litter, and thereby incurred no direct costs) to almost €73,000 per year for individual har -
bors (Mouat et al. 2010). Higher costs tended to correlate with larger and busier 
harbors. Disposal and manual removal of floating debris were observed to make up the bulk of these costs, as dredging to remove items off the seabed, although expensive, is not performed very commonly. There is no estimate for the cost of removing marine litter to the U.K. marina industry as a whole, but data from a small sample indicate that it could be costly, with one marina reporting an annual bill of €39,000 (Mouat et al. 2010). When factoring in the cost of undertaking res-cue operations the cost of marine litter to shipping and yachting rises further. An estimate for the U.K. Royal National Lifeboat Institution in 2008 calculated that 286 rescue operations to vessels with tangled propellers cost between €830,000 and €2,189,000 (Mouat et al. 2010).
14.2.3  Fisheries
The fishing sector is more commonly viewed as a source of marine litter, but it is also subject to economic costs itself. Direct economic impacts faced by the sector arise from the need to repair or replace gear that has been damaged or lost due to encounters with marine litter; repairing vessels with tangled propellers (Fig. 14.1), anchors, rudders, blocked intake pipes, etc.; loss of earnings due to time diverted to deal with marine litter encounters; and loss of earnings from reduced or con-taminated catches resulting from marine litter encounters including ghost fishing

Marine Debris program). Derelict rope crab pot “ghost fishing” at 1,091 m in Astoria Canyon, off 
Oregon (right © 2006 MBARI)373 14 The Economics of Marine Litter
(Fig. 14.1). Wallace (1990) reported that in the Eastern US, over 45 % of the com-
mercial fishers had their propellers caught, over 30 % had their gear fouled, and 
almost 40 % had their engine cooling system clogged by plastic debris at some point in time. The sector also experiences indirect losses of earnings due to the impact of loss and abandoned fishing gear on fish stocks (MacFayden et al. 2009; Sheavly and Register 2007).
There are potentially also costs associated with loss of value of fisheries 
resources (provisioning services under the ecosystem service nomenclature), whether through reductions in fish and shellfish numbers or reduced value due to impacts on quality of fish and shellfish (e.g. through ingested plastics or contami-nation with persistent organic pollutants, POPs). The body of literature describ-ing the contamination of commercially exploited fish and shellfish by microplastic ingestion is growing rapidly, as is the literature analysing the consequences of this contamination on the health of individuals and populations (Galloway 2015; 
Lusher 2015; Rochman 2015). However, as yet there have been no economic 
assessments to estimate the costs of these impacts.
Derelict fishing gear (DFG) constitutes a considerable portion of marine lit-
ter and can result in economic losses for fisheries. DFG includes any equipment, which can catch (shell-)fish, which is lost by fisheries, including trawl nets, gill nets, traps, cages and pots (National Research Council 2008). As a result of their functional design, DFG can continue to trap marine life after they have been lost (a phenomenon known as ghost fishing). Increasingly durable materials used in fishing equipment means that it can continue to ghost fish for some time; in this way it presents particular challenges as marine waste. Fisheries incur costs, firstly in having to replace the fishing gear they have lost at sea, and secondly in a reduc-tion in their potential harvestable catch, and indeed the sustainability of that catch (Butler et al. 2013; Arthur et al. 2014; Bilkovic 2014). One study in Puget Sound, Washington, estimated that over 175,000 dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister) were killed each year by derelict fishing traps, equivalent to around €586,000 or 4.5 % of the average annual harvest (Antonelis 2011).
Mouat et al. (2010) focused on estimating the direct economic impact of 
marine litter on Scottish fishing vessels (i.e. costs of repairs and direct losses in earnings, not indirect losses due to ghost fishing) and estimated that on average marine litter costs each fishing vessel between €17,000 and €19,000 per year (Mouat et al. 2010). Two-thirds of this cost (€12,000) was incurred through time lost clearing litter from nets (calculated using the average value of 1 h’s fishing time as estimated by vessels surveyed during this project). Aggregated, this costs the Scottish fishing industry as a whole between €11.7 and 13 million every year (Mouat et al. 2010). To put this in perspective, marine litter knocks 5 % off the fleets’ total annual revenue. This is clearly a substantial cost to an industry that is already under high pressure and important in coastal communities.
Similar to voluntary beach cleanup operations, there are a number of ‘Fishing-
for-Litter’ schemes in operation whereby fishermen voluntarily agree to collect the litter, which they catch in their nets during their normal fishing activity, and  
dispose of this safely on the quayside at designated waste disposal sites (Fig. 14.2). 374 S. Newman et al.
These schemes are currently in operation in the U.K., Sweden, Denmark, The 
Netherlands, Belgium and Germany, and potentially other EU countries as there is EU support to fund such operations (KIMO International 2013; European Commission 2011).
The fishers benefit from being involved as they reduce the volume of litter 
accumulating in the oceans and on beaches, and they thereby reduce the amount of time they spend untangling litter from nets and reduce the risks of other marine litter related costs described above. Best-practice guidelines indicate that Fishing-for-Litter schemes also have the benefit of changing the culture within the indus-try to adopt good waste-management practices (OSPAR 2007). These schemes are not without costs to operate, however, as coordinators are needed to promote and run the programs, and there are of course costs associated with waste disposal (OSPAR 2007). These costs will vary depending on the country and the amounts 
of litter collected, but the schemes in Europe to date demonstrate that Fishing-for-Litter is a significant and cost-effective measure to reduce litter (OSPAR 2007).
14.2.4  Aquaculture
Marine litter can result in costs to the aquaculture industry, through entangling propellers and blocking intake pipes, and time spent removing debris from and around fish farm operations. Mouat et al. (2010) surveyed finfish and shellfish aquaculture producers in Scotland and estimated that marine litter costs the sector on average €156,000 per year, which amounted to approximately €580 per year per producer. Ninety percent of this cost was due to time spent untangling fouled propellers on workboats and repairs. Removing marine litter from aquaculture sites was less of an issue overall, but this was highly variable, and in some areas it

was a regular problem. These figures demonstrate that in comparison to other sec-
tors such as fisheries, and even agriculture, the direct cost imposed by marine litter on aquaculture is relatively low.
14.2.5  Agriculture
As a terrestrial economic activity, agriculture is not the most obvious sector to suf-fer economic losses because of marine litter. Indeed, similarly to the fishing sector it is more frequently seen as a source of marine litter (de Stephanis et al. 2013). However, in some locations, debris can blow, drift or get washed up on coastal farmland, causing damage to property, equipment and presenting a risk to live-stock through ingestion and entanglement. These impacts may all lead to eco-nomic losses in addition to the cost of preventative litter removal. The Shetland Isles are one such location where marine debris litters agricultural lands, due to the prevalence of strong winds. Through interviewing farmers from Shetland with land by the coast, Hall (2000) estimated annual losses to be €500 per farmer, and 
a total of €770,000 for islands as a whole. This comprised time spent cleaning land, clearing ditches, freeing entangled animals, additional vet bills, and repairs to fences damaged by litter. Other losses to farmers not factored into this estimate were the loss of seaweed as a fertilizer due to plastic entanglement, and limits on the practice of grazing livestock on seaweed on beaches. Mouat et al. (2010) estimated that marine litter cost each smallholding an average of €841 per year and the agricultural industry of the Shetland Islands as a whole a total of approxi-mately €252,000 (based on the assumption that 25 % of the 1,200 active crofters 
were operating in areas subject to marine litter damage). The cost to small-scale agricultural producers is of particular concern given that they have small profit margins. Although the scope of these estimates is restricted to one Scottish archi-pelago and the costs of marine litter to coastal agricultural businesses elsewhere is unknown, anecdotal evidence from the south of England and Sweden suggests it is a big problem in other coastal regions, too (Mouat et al. 2010). Clearly, more research would be required to determine the impacts and costs of marine litter in other coastal agricultural enterprises.
14.2.6  Human Health
Whilst the impact of marine litter on human health is a relatively new area of research this does not negate its potential for generating economic and welfare costs. At a local level ocean collisions with marine litter can seriously injure or kill mariners (Gold et al. 2013). This is particularly the case with impacts between smaller vessels and larger objects, such as semi-submerged lost shipping contain-ers, which is a known danger to recreational sailors and fishers.376 S. Newman et al.
Plastic pollution poses a number of more nuanced risks, which could directly 
and indirectly impact on human health (Teuten et al. 2009; Thompson et al. 2009; 
Gold et al. 2013; UNEP 2014: p. 50; Galloway 2015). Firstly, the physical and chemical properties of polymers lends to their ability to facilitate the accumulation of contaminants already present in sea water. Industrial and agricultural chemi-cals, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), and aqueous metals, have been linked to health impacts such as disease and reproductive abnormalities (Teuten et al. 2009). Marine litter acts as nuclei of accumulation for such toxins, which become several orders of magnitude more concentrated on the surface of plastics (EPA 2011). For instance, plastics can con-tain up to 1 million times the concentration of PCBs in contrast to sea water (Gold et al. 2013: p. 5; EPA 2013). Secondly, chemicals used in the production of poly-mers can increase local concentrations of harmful toxins which are also known to impact on health. Additives such as bisphenol A (BPA) and flame retardants, such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), commonly found in plastic waste, can dissociate in the environment and are linked to endocrine disruption in both wildlife and humans (Gold et al. 2013). Both sources of chemicals increase the potential for bioaccumulation of toxins within food chains when marine litter is ingested by smaller organisms.
Thirdly, plastics could facilitate the transmission of, and act as a vector for, 
viral and bacterial diseases in areas where they would not naturally occur. In some locations plastic marine litter has developed its own habitat, the “plastisphere”, supporting organisms which differ from those in the surrounding water (Gold et al. 2013). Lippsett (2013) found a plastic sample dominated by bacteria, which 
cause cholera and gastrointestinal disease. Consequently invasive species and for -
eign substrates linked to marine litter could pose significant health threats. The economics of such health risks are difficult to formulate but figures are urgently needed to assess these additional cost associated with marine litter.
14.2.7  Summary
So far we have presented the results of recent research estimating the direct costs of marine litter to the key coastal and maritime economic sectors affected. Estimates of economic impacts on a national or regional scale are hard to come by, however. It is clear that we require more monitoring of the costs associated with marine lit-ter, both in terms of direct costs incurred on losses to outputs and income, and in terms of assessing health, ecosystem services, wellbeing, and welfare impacts.
What is also very clear from this review is that marine litter exerts substantial 
economic impacts on coastal sectors, and that the polluters or producers of  plastics 
do not pay for these costs. Furthermore, those who do pay are often operating with tight budgets, such as municipalities, small-scale agricultural businesses and fish-eries. In addition, the costs described and quantified in the literature consist pri-marily of the costs of cleaning up marine debris or recovering from marine litter 377 14 The Economics of Marine Litter
damage. As explained above, the cost of cleaning up is justified by the even higher 
costs of inaction. However, this expenditure does not address the underlying issue, and does not act to prevent litter from entering the marine environment in the first place. When prioritizing action and the allocation of funds, the costs of damage and clean up needs to be weighed against the cost of prevention.
14.3  Marine Litter and Economic Incentives
From an environmental economics perspective, marine litter arises, like other waste or pollution problems, through market failure. The marginal price of goods on the market, and that of disposable plastics in particular, does not reflect the full marginal cost to society of producing that good. In other words, there is an exter -
nal cost to society not borne by the producer (or consumer) as demonstrated in the previous section. Furthermore, clean seas and beaches are public goods, which are vulnerable to free-riding, whereby those disposing of waste inappropriately ben-efit from the good without paying the full cost, thereby causing contamination and degradation of the marine environment.
Like other environmental problems, marine litter can be prevented and con-
trolled using measures that limit and control this sort of behavior (command and control measures), by awareness raising and other information tools, and by using market-based measures that aim to encourage a change in behavior by altering the economic incentives in place and/or to raise revenue to bring the market price in line with the social cost.
There are a range of market-based instruments that can be used to address 
marine litter. Landfill taxes, if set at adequately high levels, can disincentivize the final disposal of waste and help to incentivize recycling and recovery, reducing the risk of waste reaching the marine environment (although care should be taken to set taxes at a level that does not give significant encouragement to illegal dumping of waste). Product taxes and charges can be used to discourage the consumption of certain products that frequently end up as marine litter, such as plastic bags, pack-aging and fishing tackle. Infrastructure charges, for example, for the use of port-waste facilities, help to ensure that waste management infrastructures and facilities are developed and maintained. Deposit-refund schemes, which are most often applied to packaging items such as bottles, can encourage return and reuse by con-sumers, and therefore reduce the number of such items ending up as litter. Hardesty et al. (2014) evaluated the effectiveness of South Australia’s container deposit scheme in reducing waste lost to beaches and reported a threefold reduction in this dominant plastic item in the environment. Direct investment in infrastructure, such as rubbish bins and secure waste collections on beaches and in coastal areas, can help to keep coastal areas free of litter and reduce the risk of items reaching the seas. Such investment can be financed for example by tourist taxes or car parking fees. High fees and fines for littering, illegal waste disposal and fly-tipping help to dissuade behaviors that result in waste escaping from formal waste management 378 S. Newman et al.
processes, reducing the risk of waste reaching the marine environment as litter (ten 
Brink et al. 2009).
The following sections of this chapter focus on a small selection of market-
based instruments, which can potentially have an impact on the amount of litter that reaches the marine environment: landfill taxes, instruments addressing plastic bags (including charges/taxes and bans), producer responsibility schemes, and fees for the use of port waste reception facilities.
14.3.1  Landfill Taxes/Levies
A significant proportion of marine litter originates from land-based sources; a global figure of 80 % is frequently cited, although the origins of this are unclear 
(Arthur et al. 2014) and figures may vary considerably regionally. The National Marine Debris Monitoring Program, which analyzed marine litter on US beaches,
1 
determined that 49 % was from land-based sources and 18 % from ocean-based sources, with a further 33 % for which the source could not be identified) (Ocean Conservancy 2007). Up to 95 % of the litter found on Australian beaches comes 
from suburban streets through the stormwater system (Clean Up Australia 2009). For this reason, measures to promote improved waste management on land have an important role to play in preventing land-based waste from reaching the seas.
One of the most common economic instruments used in the waste sector is the 
application of a tax or levy on waste sent to landfill. Landfill taxes/levies can help to tackle marine litter by increasing the price of landfill to encourage the diver -
sion of waste to other forms of treatment that are higher up in the waste hierarchy, including closed-loop waste-management processes such as recovery, recycling or reuse. If lightweight items in particular, such as many small packaging items, can be kept out of landfills, this eliminates the risk of them being blown by the wind from the surface of landfills, preventing them from reaching water courses and eventually entering the sea. It should be noted that landfill taxes can incentivise ille-gal landfilling and fly-tipping as a means of tax avoidance. Estimates of the amount of marine litter that comes from landfill and fly-tipping are limited; one estimate from the Scottish Government is that around 1.6 % of marine litter comes from fly-tipping incidents (Scottish Government 2013). To stop these unchecked methods of 
waste disposal from resulting in more waste being blown or washed into rivers and seas, landfill taxes should be accompanied by measures such as the closure of ille-gal landfills and enforcing fines on those who fly-tip or dump illegally. Producer-responsibility schemes can also help promote recycling (see below).
1The NMDMP ran from September 2001–September 2006. The US was divided into nine coastal 
regions; within each region a random selection of between 12 and 23 beach sites was chosen 
for surveying (175 sites in total). Over 600 volunteers conducted surveys at 28-day intervals,  covering a 500-m stretch of beach at each study site, and collected and recorded the various 
marine debris items found.379 14 The Economics of Marine Litter
Landfill taxes are typically charged per tonne of waste landfilled, and there 
are often different rates for active (e.g. biodegradable) and inert (e.g. mineral/
construction) waste, to reflect the varying environmental impacts of different wastes. A brief overview of the use of landfill taxes is provided here. It should be noted that this is not intended to be a fully comprehensive review of the global situation.
In Europe, many countries have introduced landfill taxes since the EU Landfill 
Directive (1999/31/EC) entered into force. The directive aims to encourage the prevention, recycling and recovery of waste by limiting its final disposal through landfills, including setting targets to reduce the amount of biodegradable waste sent to landfills and associated methane emissions. In addition, Annex I sets out requirements for the location (e.g. with regard to the proximity of water bodies and coastal waters) and technical specifications (e.g. design features to avoid pol-lution of soils and waters from landfills, including from wind-blown waste) of landfill sites. There are currently 20 countries
2 in Europe that tax waste sent to 
landfills. From 1995 to 2012, the number of EU countries implementing a landfill tax rose from 7 to 20 (Watkins et al. 2012). Over the same period, the amount of municipal waste sent to landfill decreased from around 63–33 % (Eurostat 2014a). 
In the majority of cases, the tax is collected by state tax authorities or regional institutions. However, only in some countries (Bulgaria, Finland, Belgium (Wallonia), France, Poland, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom) does part of the revenue go towards waste management and environmental initiatives (Fischer et al. 2012). The level of the tax varies considerably between countries: Watkins et al. (2012) identified a wide range of tax rates for municipal solid waste, from €3 t
−1 in Bulgaria to €107 t−1 in The Netherlands. Higher landfill taxes tend to 
result in lower proportions of municipal waste being sent to landfills and higher rates of recycling and composting. The majority of countries with total landfill charges
3 of less than €40 t−1 send over 60 % of their municipal waste to landfill. 
Countries are much more likely to meet a 50 % recycling target once landfill charges (or the cost of the cheapest disposal option) approach €100 t
−1 (Watkins 
et al. 2012). It should be noted that the best performing countries in terms of diverting waste from landfill usually also have other measures in place, such as bans on the landfilling of certain types of waste.
The Australian state of Victoria has a levy of € 17 t
−1 for rural municipal waste, 
€29 t−1 for rural industrial waste, € 34 t−1 for metropolitan municipal and indus-
trial waste. All levies are paid into the Environment Protection Fund, with revenues from the levy contributing to improved waste management including upgrading of kerbside recycling systems, developing markets for recycled materials, and

studies into waste minimization, handling and disposal, organics recycling and lit-
ter control (EPA Victoria 2013). The levy in the Sydney metropolitan area has risen sharply since 2006/07 and is planned to reach € 84 t
−1 by 2015/16 (New Zealand 
Ministry for the Environment 2014). The state of Western Australia applies a levy of €20 t
−1 (increasing to €39 t−1 from 1 January 2015) for putrescible waste and 
€6 t−1 (€28 t−1 from 1 January 2015) for inert waste deposited in metropolitan 
landfills. The levy is paid by the owner of the landfill receiving the waste, but they may pass the cost on to customers. Not less than 25 % of revenues will be spent on initiatives to manage, reduce, re-use or recycle waste and to monitor/measure waste, and 7 % provided to the Office of the Environmental Protection Authority to assist in service delivery (Wastenet 2014). Evidence from Australia on the impact of landfill levies is somewhat mixed. The Western Australian Local Government Association claims there is limited evidence that a levy directly disincentives land-fill, and that a lack of accompanying investment in waste management can actually be detrimental to waste diversion activities due to reduced expenditure on recy-cling infrastructure (WALGA 2012). The waste levy in Sydney helped to increase recycling by making waste recovery more financially attractive than landfill; the total quantity of waste to landfill was lower in 2010/11 than 2002/03, and waste recycled more than doubled over the same time period (New Zealand Ministry for the Environment 2014). Conversely, following the removal of a € 25 t
−1 landfill 
levy in Queensland, there was a 20 % reduction in recycling (Ritchie 2014), which indicates that landfill taxes may indeed encourage recycling.
New Zealand applies a tax of €6 t
−1 to any waste deposited at a waste disposal 
facility. This is paid by disposal facility operators, but they may pass the cost on to the households/businesses that generate the waste. The levy’s primary aim has been to raise revenue for waste minimization and recycling projects, but the levy was set at a relatively low level to avoid illegal dumping and to reduce the impact on businesses and households. Half of the revenues go to territorial authorities to assist with waste minimization. The rest (minus administration costs) is paid into a national waste minimization fund (New Zealand Ministry for the Environment 2013). A recent review of the effectiveness of the waste disposal levy found that the levy is estimated to be applied to only 30 % of total waste disposed of to land, and that the amount of waste landfilled has increased by around 6 % between 2010 and 2013. Revenues have supported a broad range of waste minimization initia-tives, although the funding outcomes should be more effectively measured and monitored (New Zealand Ministry for the Environment 2014).
14.3.2  Plastic Bag Initiatives
Plastic is the most common litter type found in the marine environment. In European regional seas, for example, plastics comprise more than half of the marine litter. More than half of the plastic fraction of marine litter consists of plastic pack-aging waste, with bottles and bags being the most frequently found items (European 381 14 The Economics of Marine Litter
Commission 2013a). Plastics account for some 78 % by number of pieces, and 
67 % by weight, of washed-up materials on the coasts of the Northwest Pacific 
Region (Kanehiro 2012). Lightweight plastic bags are particularly prone to becom-ing marine litter since they are seen by consumers as single-use, are often disposed of carelessly, are frequently not accepted in household recycling collections, and are easily blown by the wind into drains, water courses and the marine environment. During the Ocean Conservancy’s 2013 International Coastal Cleanup,
4 6 % of the 
total litter items found were plastic bags (grocery or other plastic bags) (Ocean Conservancy 2014). In China in 2012, plastic bags comprised 23 % of drifting 
marine litter found in the sea, and 59 % of that found on beaches (Meng and Chen 2013). In Shanghai, they accounted for between 15 and 29 % of all marine litter items recorded during coastal surveys between 2008 and 2012 (ICC 2013).
European Commission guidance for EU Member States on developing waste 
prevention programs, published in October 2012, suggests that plastic bags can be effectively targeted by waste prevention activities (European Commission 2012). Many countries have already taken specific action to tackle plastic bags: over 30 countries have introduced taxes/fees, and over 30 have introduced bans for single-use carrier bags, or bans on bags with certain characteristics, such as those made from plastic of less than a certain thickness (Earth Policy Institute 2013). In some countries, there is a mix of bans and charges, since this is an area of policy that is often dealt with at a local or city level. The following paragraphs summarise several of these initiatives, with a focus on those where information is available on their impacts.
In Europe, several countries have introduced taxes or charges on single-use 
(disposable) plastic carrier bags. Denmark has applied a charge for plastic and paper carrier bags since 1993 (the charge depends on the weight and material). The year after the tax was introduced saw an initial reduction in bag use of 60 % (Earth Policy Institute 2013).
Ireland introduced a €0.15 levy per general purpose plastic bag in 2002, and 
increased the levy to €0.22 in 2007. The levy led to an immediate decrease in plas-tic bag use from an estimated 328 bags per capita per year to 21 bags per cap-ita. Although per capita consumption increased again to 31 bags during 2006, an increase in the levy in 2007 led to a further reduction to 18 bags in 2010 (Department of Environment Community and Local Government 2013). Plastic bags constituted 0.3 % of litter pollution nationally in 2012 compared to an esti-
mated 5 % in 2001 prior to the introduction of the levy (National Litter Pollution Monitoring System 2013). In 2001 (pre-levy) around 17 plastic bags were found 
per 500 m of coastline. This figure fell to around 10 bags in 2002 (the year the levy was introduced), 5 bags in 2003, and 2 in 2012 (Doyle and O’Hagan 2013).
In the U.K., a € 0.06 levy on the use of single-use carrier bags (plastic and paper) 
was introduced in Wales in 2011, and in Northern Ireland in 2013; retailers in 
4Ocean Conservancy’s (2013) International Coastal Cleanup involved nearly 650,000 volun-
teers at over 5,500 beach/coastal sites covering a total length of 12,914 miles in 92 countries and 
locations.382 S. Newman et al.
Scotland introduced the same charge in 2014, and supermarkets and larger stores 
in England will adopt the same charge in 2015. One year after the introduction of the Welsh charge, a 70–96 % decrease was observed in bag use at food retailers 
and a 68–75 % decrease at fashion retailers (Welsh Government 2012). While in 2010 (pre-charge), 0.35 million thin-gauge carrier bags were distributed in Wales; in 2011 (the year the charge was introduced), 0.27 billion bags were distributed 
and one year after the introduction of the charge the figure dropped significantly to 0.07 billion bags (WRAP 2013). This represents an 81 % reduction in only three years whereas no reduction was observed in any other nation of the U.K. over the same time period, which suggests that the charge has significantly contributed to the reduction in Wales. During International Coastal Cleanup days, 435 plastic bags were found in Wales in 2011, and 292 in 2012 (Ocean Conservancy 2012, 2013). 
These data only relate to a single day each year and therefore present a limited pic-ture, but the reduction in plastic bag use due to the charge may have had at least some impact on the number of bags found.
In November 2013, the European Commission put forward a proposal for 
European Union legislation to reduce the use of lightweight plastic bags. The proposal would amend the existing Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (1994/62/EC) (see Chen 2015), requiring all EU Member States to take action to 
reduce the consumption of lightweight plastic bags, but allowing them to choose the most appropriate measures to do this (European Commission 2013b). The pro-posal will be discussed in the European Parliament and Council in 2015.
Several nations in Africa have either totally banned the use of plastic bags 
(Eritrea in 2005; Somalia/Somaliland in 2005; Tanzania in 2006/Zanzibar in 2008; Democratic Republic of Congo in 2011) or banned the use of bags below a mini-mum thickness (Kenya and Uganda, both 2007) (see also Chen 2015). Botswana (2007) established a minimum thickness for bags and required retailers to apply a minimum levy to thicker bags (many retailers charged more than the minimum), to fund government environmental projects. A study of four retail chains 18 months after implementation of the charge showed that bag use had fallen by 50 % (Earth Policy Institute 2013). Morocco has implemented a minimum thickness standard. In 2004, South Africa implemented a tax of €0.002/bag for thicker bags, to run concurrently with a minimum thickness ban (Miller 2012). A portion of the tax funds environmental projects. Whilst bag use decreased by 90 % when the meas-ures were first introduced, consumption has slowly risen again since (Earth Policy Institute 2013).
One-hundred and thirty-two cities and counties in the US, with a combined 
population of over 20 million people, now have plastic bag bans or fees. In California, the state with the largest number of anti-bag measures in place, plas-tic bag purchases by retailers fell from around 48,000 tonnes in 2008 to around 28,000 tonnes in 2012, a decrease of around 42 %. The Department of Public Works reported that the January 2012 ban on plastic bags in retail stores and the €0.08 charge for paper bags, implemented in unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County, had led to a sustained 90 % reduction in single-use bag use at large stores by December 2013. A €0.04 charge for plastic and paper carryout bags at all food/383 14 The Economics of Marine Litter
alcohol retailers in Washington DC, introduced in January 2010, led to four out 
of five households using fewer bags, with two thirds of residents reporting seeing less plastic bag litter after the tax came into effect (Larsen and Venkova 2014). It is estimated that the bag tax in Washington DC reduced grocery bag sales by some-where between 67 and 80 % after two years (Beacon Hill Institute 2012).
In Asia, several countries have taken action against plastic bags, including com-
plete bans (Bangladesh: 2002; Papua New Guinea: 2009), minimum thickness bans (Taiwan: 2001) or taxes (Taiwan, tax of € 0.02–0.08 since 2003; Hong Kong, tax of 
€0.05 since 2009). The Taiwanese charge increased the number of people who reg-
ularly took used plastic bags to reuse when they went shopping (rising from 18 % in 2001 to 72 % in 2006), and the Hong Kong charge successfully reduced plastic bag use by 75 % in affected stores (Earth Policy Institute 2013). In the first year following the 2008 ban on the provision of free plastic bags in all shops in China, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) estimated that super -
markets had reduced plastic bag usage by 66 % (amounting to 40 billion fewer bags used) (Block, n.d.). Raw data, however, do not indicate that this reduction in usage translated into a reduction in bags found as marine litter. International Coastal Cleanup (ICC) surveys in the Nanhui District of Shanghai found 129 plastic bags in September 2007 (pre-ban), 286 in September 2008 (year of ban introduction), then (post-ban) an average of 400 per site per cleanup in 2009, an average of 245 per site per cleanup in 2010, and an average of 1,294 per site per cleanup in 2012 (NOWPAP DINRAC 2014). It is not clear whether these fluctuations (and signifi-cant increase in 2012) are due to variations in the number of volunteers participat-ing in the cleanups, illegal selling of bags, ineffective implementation of the ban, or bags from non-Chinese sources being washed up on the coast. Indeed, bans in Bhutan (1999), India (attempted first in 1999 and several times subsequently) and Bangladesh (2002) have largely failed to bring about a decrease in use due to poor implementation and enforcement (Earth Policy Institute 2013).
In Australia, South Australia banned plastic bags in 2009, the Northern 
Territory and Australian Capital Territory followed suit in 2011, and Tasmania banned very thin plastic bags in 2013. Several cities and towns have also intro-duced voluntary bans. The South Australian ban purportedly encouraged custom-ers to bring their own bags more often (Earth Policy Institute 2013). New Zealand has had a voluntary retailer levy of €0.03–0.06 since 2009 (Miller 2012).
There are also myriad voluntary initiatives worldwide undertaken by individual 
retailers to attempt to limit the number of disposable bags they hand out to cus-tomers, ranging from eliminating disposable bags altogether to charging for dis-posable bags or selling reusable bags. In Spain, a voluntary agreement between Catalonia’s Waste Agency, regional and national business groups, plastic bag man-ufacturers, food distributors and supermarkets led to a 40 % decrease in the con-
sumption of single-use plastic bags between 2007 and 2011, and 87 % reduction (equal to 1 billion individual bags) in annual supermarket plastic bag use (Earth Policy Institute 2013).
From the examples outlined here, it is clear that bans and charges have had 
varying degrees of success, ranging from no discernible impact (failed bans in 384 S. Newman et al.
Bhutan, India and Bangladesh) to reductions in bag use of over 90 % (charges/
taxes in Ireland, Wales and parts of Los Angeles County). Sometimes impressive initial results are not sustained over time (Ireland, South Africa). This picture indi-cates that there is no one-size-fits all solution to the issue of plastic bags and that measures must be tailored to address different consumer/business behavior in dif-ferent countries. It perhaps also suggests a need for measures that can be adapted to respond to failures following initial successes (e.g. increase in charges), and highlights the need for full implementation and proper enforcement of measures such as charges and bans to ensure their success.
14.3.3  Packaging Producer Responsibility in the EU
Extended producer responsibility (EPR) is an environmental policy approach in which a producer’s responsibility for a product is extended to the post-consumer stage of a product’s life cycle, meaning that they are responsible (financially and/or logistically) for dealing with the product when it becomes waste. This concept has been widely implemented in the EU over the past 20 years, with the introduc-tion of a great variety of EPR schemes and the creation of producer-responsibility organisations (PROs), collective entities set up by producers or through legislation to meet the recovery and recycling obligations of individual producers.
Waste packaging forms a significant proportion of marine litter. Food wrappers, 
plastic and glass drinks bottles, bottle caps and drinks cans all regularly feature in the top ten most frequently found items during marine litter surveys; together these items comprised 31 % of all items found during the Ocean Conservancy’s 2013 International Coastal Cleanup. When plastic and paper shopping bags, which may also be classed as packaging, are added, this figure increases to 37 % (Ocean Conservancy 2014). More than half of the plastic fraction of marine litter consists 
of plastic packaging waste (European Commission 2013a). This section therefore 
focuses on EPR schemes that deal with waste packaging.
All EU Member States have implemented EPR for packaging waste, since it is 
targeted by the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive, 94/62/EC. In the 27 EU Member States in 2011 (prior to the accession of Croatia), 64 % of waste packag-ing was recycled (this figure includes composting for biodegradable packaging), and 77 % was recovered (this figure includes incineration with energy recovery). Within these figures there are of course variations between countries, ranging from only 41 % recycling in Poland to 80 % in Belgium, and only 45 % recovery in Malta to 97 % 
in Germany (Eurostat 2014b). Successful EPR schemes and the associated recycling 
infrastructures, including doorstep recycling collections, play a significant role in achieving high recycling and recovery rates and diverting packaging waste away from final disposal. Capturing packaging waste in closed-loop collection and recycling sys-tems reduces the risk of items reaching the seas and becoming marine litter.
Typically in packaging EPR schemes, producers pay a fee to a PRO based 
on the amount of packaging they place on the market (for example, a fee per 385 14 The Economics of Marine Litter
tonne of paper/card, glass, aluminium packaging, with the fees for each material  
typically being different). These fees are then be used to cover, or contribute to, the  
cost of collection and treatment of waste packaging. Basing producers’ contribu-
tions on the actual amount of packaging they place on the market ensures they pay their ‘fair share’ of the cost of waste management; this is the application of the producer-pays principle in practice, internalising the end-of-life costs into the cost of the product. This can incentivize producers to reduce the amount of packaging they place on the market, since this decreases the fees they pay.
A recent study (BIO by Deloitte et al. 2014) that looked at packaging EPR 
schemes in seven EU countries found that fees paid by producers ranged from just over €1 per capita per year in the U.K. to almost €20 per capita per year in Austria. The wide variation was primarily due to the different levels of cost  coverage: fees from the purchase of Packaging Recovery Notes (PRN) in the U.K. 
were estimated to cover only 10 % of the total cost of the system, whereas in most of the other schemes reviewed, 100 % of the net costs of collection and treatment of separately collected waste were covered. Discussions with stakeholders during the study did not provide a consensus on whether producers should also finance the costs of dealing with packaging that is littered by consumers; measures that more directly target consumer behavior, such as deposit-refund schemes for pack-aging, have the potential to reduce littering. The more expensive schemes were not necessarily found to be the best in terms of recycling and recovery levels achieved. The highest recycling rates were achieved in Belgium: 85 % for household pack-aging and 82 % for commercial and industrial packaging, with costs per capita per 
year of around €8 and just over €1 respectively.
Many factors have an impact on the costs and performance of EPR schemes. 
Collection costs are typically higher in areas with lower population density. The historical development and quality of waste collection and treatment infrastructure is important, since economies of scale can be achieved through greater sorting and treatment capacities; EPR schemes can help to trigger infrastructure development and to finance improvements and maintenance. The value of secondary materials on national markets can be important, and can be influenced both by the demand for secondary raw materials and by the provision of high-quality materials once a recy-cling industry is in place. Citizens’ awareness of separate collection schemes, and their willingness to participate, is also crucial, and investment in public communi-cation can help EPR schemes to succeed. Other waste policy instruments, includ-ing those discussed in this chapter (disposal taxes) and others (pay-as-you-throw schemes, deposit-refund schemes, etc.) can complement EPR schemes and increase the efficiency of the general waste management system (BIO by Deloitte et al. 2014).
14.3.4  Charges for Port Reception Facilities
With the abundance of ships using the oceans for shipping, transportation, tourism, military purposes and other maritime industries, there is a tremendous amount of 386 S. Newman et al.
waste being generated at sea. It is therefore important for countries and their ports 
to provide adequate reception facilities for all of the types of ships that frequent those ports and all the types of waste they produce. It is also important to create proper incentives to encourage ships to use the correct facilities at ports, rather than dump waste into the sea. International regulations ratified by the signing members of MARPOL (73/78), the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, govern what kinds of waste can be discharged overboard and where they can be discharged. MARPOL prohibits the disposal of plastics at sea, as well as other garbage (though there are exceptions for food waste), and requires signa-tories to the convention to ensure that adequate reception facilities for ship-gener -
ated waste and cargo residues are established and that they are able to receive such waste from ships calling at the port without causing any undue delay. Although the convention provides a number of recommendations on how reception facilities can be established it does not specify how waste should be handled, and leaves all organisational issues to the responsible port authority. Compliance with the con-vention requires the efficient collection of waste from ships, and what happens thereafter is regulated by national legislation (for more details see Chen 2015).
One of the most important factors in incentivizing ship waste delivery is the 
waste fee system. Handling and disposing of waste is costly to ports (with the exception of oily waste, which, due to rising oil prices, has recently become eco-nomical to collect and recycle) (Øhlenschlæger et al. 2013). Like the other ser -
vices provided by ports, and in coherence with the polluter-pays principle, the cost of waste collection should rightly be recovered through the collection of port fees. However, high fees for waste collection can act as a disincentive to ships to discharge their waste at port, when they can throw their waste unseen overboard for free (if they can get away with it). It is therefore necessary to strike a balance between cost-recovery of waste handling and not discouraging disposal at port.
Because of the increasing number of illegal discharges in the Baltic Sea, in 
the late 1990s the HELCOM Convention provided a number of recommendations regarding the introduction of a ‘No Special Fee’ or ‘indirect fee’ in Baltic ports, leading to the introduction of a 100 % indirect fee system for solid garbage waste (‘household’ waste, oily waste from machinery space and sewage) by several Baltic Sea ports (Gothenburg, Copenhagen, Klaipeda, Helsinki and Stockholm) (Øhlenschlæger et al. 2013). An indirect fee means that the cost of delivering solid garbage waste to port reception facilities is included in the fee paid by all ships visiting the port, irrespective of the quantities discharged, and is not specified on the invoice (Ikonen 2013).
The no-special-fee system effectively prevents cost from becoming a dis-
incentive for using port reception facilities. Given that all ships will pay the fee regardless of use, they therefore all contribute to the financing of waste collection facilities, and this approach also has the benefit of reducing the fee. The admin-istrative burden on port operators also appears lower when a 100 % indirect-fee system is adopted, because operators simply collect waste without the ports’ finan-cial administrations needing to calculate fees based on the actual amounts of waste delivered (Øhlenschlæger et al. 2013). One negative effect that has been observed, 387 14 The Economics of Marine Litter
however, is that ships are incentivized to deliver oily waste at each port, rather 
than accumulating the waste on board and delivering only when slop tanks are full (Ikonen 2012; Øhlenschlæger et al. 2013). This results in a costly and inefficient 
situation whereby smaller amounts of oily waste are being delivered at each port. For solid garbage waste this is not really a problem as more frequent deliveries of smaller amounts of waste are almost as convenient and cheap to dispose of as less frequent larger quantities (Øhlenschlæger et al. 2013). In addition, as the fee is not 
proportional to the amount of waste produced, it does not encourage waste reduc-tion on board vessels (Ikonen 2012).
There is no evidence for the effectiveness of the no-special-fee system imple-
mented in the Baltic on trends in waste delivered in ports, as quantities of waste delivered to ports is influenced by many factors, and it is almost impossible to detect illegal dumping of solid waste because essentially you would have to catch a perpetrator red-handed. However, there are data on detected incidences of ille-gal oil spills in the Baltic (which can be observed using aerial surveys), which indicate a decline in illegal spills following the introduction of the no-special-fee (HELCOM 2012; Ikonen 2013; Øhlenschlæger et al. 2013). Given that solid waste 
is easier to deliver than oily waste and is often delivered at the same time, it is rea-sonable to assume that the number of illegal waste discharges at sea also dropped over this period (Øhlenschlæger et al. 2013).
14.4  Choosing Economic Instruments
Economic instruments to tackle marine litter should be designed so as to deliver three objectives:
1. Minimize production of marine litter.
2. To minimize the harm caused by marine litter.
3. To avoid unintended consequences from the application of the instrument.Achieving all of these objectives is a challenge. This chapter has pro-
vided examples of the use of economic instruments to reduce different types of 
waste that contribute to marine litter or to target specific sources of such waste. However, there is a difference between reducing waste arisings and managing dis-posal, which is the focus of economic instruments currently applied to waste, and addressing the harm caused by marine litter.
Reducing the quantity of marine litter may depend on targeting key sources. 
For example, where waste enters the environment affects its ability to contribute to marine litter. A plastic bag dropped from a ship is more likely to become marine litter than one dropped on coastal land which is, in turn, more likely to become marine litter than one dropped 100 km inland.
Targeting the economic instruments to address marine litter that causes the 
most harm is particularly problematic. Marine litter causes different types of impacts and the harm arising from these varies—ghost fishing, suffocation by 388 S. Newman et al.
plastic bags, introduction of toxic substances—such impacts may be unique 
to some types of waste or focused around particular types of waste. In contrast, the impact of marine litter on tourism due to the presence of litter on beaches is largely a factor of its total quantity (although some types of waste are particularly unpleasant or unsanitary).
In addressing marine litter, economic instruments can be used to reduce the 
impacts of such litter in a variety of ways. Such instruments may:
•	Incentivize industries to use less plastic (packaging) either through economic 
disincentives/subsidies (internalizing external cost);
•	Target waste arisings generally—such as with a landfill tax;
•	Target specific types of waste—such as plastic bags;
•	Target sources of waste most problematic for marine litter—such as shipping;
•	Target individual types of marine litter—such as to reduce ghost fishing;
•	Pay for the collection of litter;
•	Target the toxicity of litter;
•	Discourage polluting behavior.
Economic instruments have been adopted for some of these types of waste/lit-
ter. However, the toxicity of waste/litter is usually addressed through regulation controlling the quality of products or materials. The use of a regulatory approach on this issue in Europe, for example, is strongly linked to the single EU market. However, differential taxes or charges for products with materials that would have different toxicities in water are theoretically possible.
All instruments can have unintended consequences, that is impacts other than 
those for which the instrument is designed. The most obvious are costs to busi-nesses, administrations or individuals. Economic instruments may have such costs—charges are an obvious cost, but administrations may incur costs to admin-ister an instrument. However, where charges or taxes are levied these can be used to pay for their administration or contribute in other ways (e.g. funding awareness raising to ensure compliance, monitoring of instrument efficiency).
The choice of economic instrument also needs to consider the acceptance of 
the instrument by those affected. An instrument that results in additional costs (a tax, charge, etc.) may be resisted by some stakeholders. For example, ‘pay-as-you-throw’ schemes are strongly opposed by some communities, but not others. However, those same communities may welcome a reward scheme to  encourage 
‘good’ behavior funded by local taxes (yet this still results in costs to people). Acceptance may change over time: for example, where plastic bag taxes were introduced early resistance has largely disappeared as communities have seen the benefits of the schemes.
Finally, it is worth noting that there is discussion on the use of economic instru-
ments to manage litter on beaches, i.e. the financing of its removal. For example, Birdir et al. (2013) undertook a willingness-to-pay study of beach litter in Turkey. Their conclusions suggested local taxes and collection boxes as means to fund beach cleanups. However, while it is appropriate to consider how such services are funded, these are not economic instruments to tackle the problem at source.389 14 The Economics of Marine Litter
14.5  Conclusions
Marine litter is a complex problem to address, which exerts significant economic 
costs, often borne not by the polluter but by coastal and marine industries such as fisheries, aquaculture, tourism, etc. (some of which also contribute significantly to marine litter). Economic instruments have a potentially important role to play in addressing marine litter, with initiatives in place in several countries proving that they can lead to significant reductions in waste entering the environment (ten Brink et al. 2009).
The development of effective and efficient instruments requires a strong link 
between the behavior change driven by the instrument and the harm caused by marine litter. However, there are several areas where there is a lack of sufficient information to make this link. At the heart of this is the problem of understand-ing the harm caused by marine litter. The harm caused by some forms of litter is known, however, there are large gaps in this understanding.
While the presence of litter in the marine environment and even its ingestion, 
etc., in species is documented, it is not clear what impact it is having on criti-cal populations of marine organisms or indeed species higher up the food chain (including humans). Further, while some specific types of litter are identified as having some impacts (discarded nets, plastic bags, etc.), the impacts of other types of litter are currently poorly understood, which is most notable with the debate on micro- and nanoplastics. In relation to socio-economic impacts, impacts on tour -
ism from beach litter are documented, but a quantitative link between the impact and levels of litter is poorly understood (Ballance et al. 2000).
These links between types, quantities and sources of marine litter and their var -
ied impacts are important to understand if targeted economic instruments are to be developed. Otherwise an instrument may lead to a reduction in litter, but with a limited reduction in impact.

Regulation and Management

M. Bergmann et al. (eds.), Marine Anthropogenic Litter,  DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-16510-3_15Abstract This chapter aims to provide an overview of the regulation and man-
agement instruments developed at international, regional and national levels 
to address marine litter problems, put forward the potential gaps in the existing management body and suggest solutions. While not covering the gamut of all rel-evant instruments, a number of existing instruments, including specific manage-ment measures contained therein, were profiled as illustration. The management measures illustrated are either on a mandatory or voluntary basis and provide a general, snapshot picture of the management framework of marine litter. They can be broadly divided into four categories: preventive, mitigating, removing and behavior-changing. The preventive and behavior-changing measures are particu-larly important in addressing marine litter at its root. The former schemes include source reduction, waste reuse and recycling, containing debris at points of entry into receiving waters and land-based management initiatives (e.g. restriction of the use of plastic bags, establishment of extended producer responsibility). The lat-ter schemes aid people’s engagement in the other three types of measures, includ-ing education campaigns and activities raising awareness (e.g. Fishing for Litter). The potential gaps include limits of existing instruments in addressing plastic marine litter, deficiencies in the legislation and a lack of enforcement of regula-tions, poor cooperation among countries on marine litter issues and insufficient data on marine litter. To fill these gaps, recommendations are proposed, including establishment of a new international instrument targeted to the plastic marine litter problem, amending existing instruments to narrow exceptions and clarify enforce-ment standards, establishing national marine litter programe, enhancing participa-tion and cooperation of states with regard to international/regional initiative, and devising measures to prevent marine litter from fishing vessels.

15.1  Introduction
Marine litter (also called marine debris) has long been on the political and public 
agenda. It is recognized as a worldwide rising pollution problem affecting all the oceans and coastal areas of the world (Galgani et al. 2015; Ryan 2015; Thompson 2015). The increasing production and use of durable synthetic materials such as plas-tics
1 has led to a gradual, but significant accumulation of litter in the marine environ-
ment, making it ever more difficult to tackle (Barnes et al. 2009; Kühn et al. 2015). Moreover, the high-profile reports of garbage patches found in the North Pacific and North Atlantic regions (Pichel et al. 2007; Law et al. 2010; Howell et al. 2012) further 
propel an intensified international drive to address the ongoing problem of marine lit-ter. Indeed, the model simulations suggest that debris accumulates in a number of convergence zones or gyres where they remain for many years (UNEP 2013).
Marine litter is defined as “any persistent, manufactured or processed solid mate-
rial discarded, disposed of or abandoned in the marine and coastal environment” (UNEP 2005, 2009). It is largely associated with diverse human activities occurring 
both on land and at sea, and is concomitant with the increasing use of synthetic mate-rials, industrialization and urbanization of coastal areas, and inadequate disposal practices. Generally it can be said that the problem of marine litter is rooted in the prevailing production and consumption pattern and the way we dispose of and man-age waste. Marine litter originates from three main sources: land-based, riverine and ocean-based sources (Galgani et al. 2015; Browne 2015; Jambeck et al. 2015). The 
former include public littering, poor waste management practices, industrial activi-ties, sewage related debris and storm water discharge, all of which can be transported via rivers (Morritt et al. 2014; Free et al. 2014; Hoellein et al. 2014). The latter include fishing activities, shipping, marine leisure industry, and offshore oil and hydrocarbon industries (Mouat et al. 2010). In particular, derelict fishing gear
2 has 
become a serious concern with the intensified fishing effort in the world’s oceans and the increasing durability of fishing gear (Macfadyen et al. 2009; Bilkovic et al. 2014).
It is widely documented that marine litter has a wide range of adverse environ-
mental, economic, social and public health and safety impacts (Newman et al. 2015). 
They are illustrated by marine litter injuring or killing wildlife by ingestion and/or entanglement (Jones 1995; Bugoni et al. 2001; Donohue et al. 2007; Allen et al. 2012; Bond et al. 2013; Baulch and Perry 2014; Kühn et al. 2015), altering ecosystems by introducing non-native species (Barnes 2002; CBD 2012; Kiessling et al. 2015),  
1Since 1950, global plastics production has continued the growth pattern by 9 % per annum. 
From 1.7 million t in 1950, total global production reached 288 million t in 2012 (PlasticsEurope 
2013).
2Derelict fishing gear is often referred to ALDFG, which is a collective term for fishing gear that 
has been abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded (Macfadyen et al. 2009).397 15 Regulation and Management of Marine Litter 
threatening sensitive habitats (e.g. corals, salt marsh) by moving along the  seabed 
(derelict fishing gear) (Donohue et al. 2001; Arthur et al. 2014), posing risks to 
human health and safety (e.g. hazards to navigation) (Taylor et al. 2014), entailing 
economic costs to coastal towns/communities, fisheries, tourism, and other maritime industries (Ballance et al. 2000; Mouat et al. 2010; Jang et al. 2014; Newman et al. 2015). For instance, the total number of turtles entangled by the 8,690 derelict fish-ing nets sampled in northern Australia was estimated to be between 4,886 and 14,600 (Wilcox et al. 2014). The estimate of damage cost from marine litter across the 21 Pacific Rim economics is € 949 million annually in total, € 273 million for the fishing 
industry, €209 million for the shipping industry and € 467 million for marine tour -
ism (Mcllgorm et al. 2011). In addition to these negative impacts, there is a growing 
concern about microplastics as they increase the risk of plastics entering food webs (Lusher 2015). If ingested microplastics have the potential to transfer toxic substances 
to the food chain, posing a threat to the health of humans and ecosystems (Teuten et al. 2009; Thompson et al. 2009; Rochman 2015).
To minimize the negative impacts, a plethora of instruments has been devel-
oped at international, regional and national levels to prevent, reduce and manage marine litter. They represent a wide range of international, regional and national efforts devoted to combat marine litter. The goal of this article is to provide an overview of these instruments, to identify the potential gaps in the existing man-agement body and suggest solutions.
As it is impossible and impractical to cover the gamut of all relevant instruments 
in detail within the scope of this chapter, I will first consider the general mechanisms of the instruments and refer to specific ones as illustration when appropriate. This approach has the advantage of providing a general, snapshot picture of the management framework of marine litter, while also laying out the specifics of certain instruments, including the management measures contained therein. It should also be noted that marine litter is an issue of, or related to, broader topics, such as marine environmental protection, changes in biodiversity, rafting of invasive species, water quality and hazard-ous waste, waste and sewage water management as well as eco design and producer responsibility. The instruments addressing these broader issues would also be applicable to marine litter, although not specifically mentioned. However, as such instruments are large in scope and may not encompass the specifics of marine litter management, I will focus on those that specifically address marine litter.
15.2  Instruments of Marine Litter at International, 
Regional and National Levels
15.2.1  General Mechanisms of Instruments
As previously mentioned, a large number of instruments at international, regional 
and national levels have been adopted to tackle marine litter problems. These instruments comprise conventions, agreements, regulations, strategies, action 398 C.-L Chen
plans, programs and guidelines. They contain specific management measures that 
are either compulsory or voluntary.
There are two basic types of instruments at the international level, in terms of 
their connection with regional or national instruments. The first comprises those, which are explicitly transposed into regional or national ones, usually in the form of regional agreements or national legislations. Similar texts can also be found in the instruments at the regional or national level. Examples include international instruments such as Annex V
3 of MARPOL 73/78,4 the London Protocol and the 
Action Plan on tackling the inadequacy of port reception facilities (PRFs). The corresponding regional or national instruments transposed from international ones include: the European Union (EU) PRF Directive, the Annex IV of the Helsinki Convention, the United States (US) Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act, the United Kingdom (UK) Merchant Shipping (Prevention of Pollution by Sewage and Garbage from Ships) Regulations 2008, and various other national legislations. The second type comprises instruments, which are not explicitly transposed into regional or national schemes. These instruments mostly serve as global guiding instruments encouraging regional bodies or countries to follow the actions proposed therein, or as a platform for the states concerned to engage in coordination and cooperation in marine litter issues. The most prominent examples are perhaps a series of initiatives developed by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), including the Regional Sea Programme (RSP), Guidelines on survey and monitoring of marine litter, Guidelines on the use of market-based and economic instruments and the Honolulu Strategy.
As for the instruments at the regional or national level that lack a clear link 
traced back to international instruments, they are devised by their own respective regional bodies or nations to deal with marine litter problems. These instruments usually consist of regional agreements, regional or national programs, legislations, or activities dealing with specific aspects of marine litter problems. Examples include the Barcelona Convention, the Guideline for monitoring marine litter on the beaches in the OSPAR
5 Maritime Area, the EU Marine Strategy Framework 
Directive, the CCAMLR6 Marine Debris Program, the US National Marine Debris 
Program, numerous coastal cleanup activities, and various national legislations rel-evant to marine litter.

15.2.2  Examples of Instruments on Marine Litter
This section presents examples of instruments at international, regional and 
national levels to illustrate the current regulation and management of marine litter.
15.2.2.1  International Instruments
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)The UNCLOS is one of the most important agreements related to the use of the 
oceans. The convention entered into force in 1994 and comprises 320 articles and nine annexes. It established a comprehensive regime for the law of the sea by gov-erning all aspects of the oceans from geopolitical delimitations to environmental control, scientific research, economic and commercial activities, technology and the settlement of disputes relating to ocean matters (Roberts 2010). In particular, articles 192–237 of Part XII are dedicated to the protection and preservation of the marine environment. While the provisions do not explicitly refer to marine litter, they place a general obligation on states to protect and preserve the marine envi-ronment, which can be used in the context of marine litter regulation.
Annex V of MARPOL 73/78
Annex V of MARPOL 73/78 is the major international instrument addressing 
ocean-based litter pollution from ships and was developed under the auspices of the international Maritime Organization (IMO). Annex V was recently revised in 2011 and came into force in 2013. The revised Annex V provides an updated framework for the control of garbage generated by ships. It imposes a general ban on discharges of all garbage from ships at sea, except for a few clearly defined cir -
cumstances.
7 These circumstances are associated with the types of garbage that can 
be disposed of, specifications of the distances from the coast, discharge of garbage within or outside special areas,
8 the manner in which they may be disposed of, and 
en route requirements for allowable discharge.9 The updated disposal regulations 
7Revised Annex V , reg. 3.
8Revised Annex V , reg 1: Special areas refer to a sea area where for recognized technical reasons 
in relation to its oceanographic and ecological condition and to the particular character of its traf-
fic the adoption of special mandatory methods for the prevention of sea pollution by garbage is required. The special areas of Annex V are the Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Red Sea, the Gulfs area, the North Sea, Antarctica and the Wider Caribbean.
9Revised Annex V , reg 1.: En route means that the ship is underway at sea on a course or courses, 
including deviation from the shortest direct route, which as far as practicable for navigational purposes, will cause any discharge to be spread over as great an area of the sea as is reasonable and practicable.400 C.-L Chen
are summarized in Table 15.1. Other major changes include expanding the require-
ments for placards and garbage management plans to fixed and floating plat-forms,
10 and reduction of the minimum tonnage limit for garbage management 
plans from 400 gross tonnage (GT) to 100 GT.11
Major provisions remaining unchanged include: the obligation to provide a 
Garbage Record Book (GRB) for ships ≥400 GT or ships certified to carry ≥15 
persons,12 and the provision of adequate reception facilities at ports without caus-
ing undue delay to ships.13 A GRB is to record each discharge made at sea or a 
reception facility, or a completed incineration, including date, time, ship position, category of the garbage and the estimated amount discharged or incinerated.
14 The 
GRB is subject to inspection by the competent authority of a party to MARPOL 73/78 when the ship is in port.
15
London Protocol
The London Protocol (LP) is a major instrument dealing with dumping of wastes 
and other matter at sea. The discharge of garbage during normal operations as reg-ulated in the Annex V of MARPOL 73/78 is not considered as dumping.
16 In 
1996, the protocol was adopted to further modernize the 1972 London Convention
17 and eventually replace it. The protocol entered into force in 2006. 
While the goal of the 1972 convention is to regulate pollution by dumping, the goal of the Protocol is to stop waste dumping at sea (Louka 2006). Namely, the protocol is more restrictive in regulating wastes dumping than the 1972 convention by introducing a reverse listing approach. This approach is, in essence, to prohibit the dumping of any wastes or other matter except for the materials listed in Annex I.
18 Dumping of these materials (such as dredged material, sewage sludge, fish 
wastes, vessels and platforms, inert, inorganic geological material) requires a per -
mit and parties shall adopt measures to ensure that the issuance of permits and per -
mit conditions comply with Annex II.19 In addition, the protocol prohibits 
incineration of wastes at sea and the export of wastes to countries for dumping or

parties ratify.
Action Plan on Tackling the Inadequacy of PRFs
In 2006, the Marine Environment Protection Committee of the IMO approved the 
Action Plan on tackling the inadequacy of PRFs. The plan was developed to con-tribute to the effective implementation of MARPOL 73/78 and to promote quality and environmental consciousness among administrations and the shipping indus-try. It covers standardized reporting, information on PRFs, equipment technology, types and amount of wastes, regulatory matters, technical cooperation and assistance.

UNEP Regional Sea Programme
The UNEP Regional Sea Programme and Global Programme of Action (GPA22) 
embarked in 2003 on the development of a Global Initiative on Marine Litter. This 
initiative has succeeded in organizing and implementing regional activities on marine litter around the world. Activities focusing on managing marine litter were arranged through individual agreements in 12 Regional Seas.
23 The main activities 
include: a review and assessment of the status of marine litter in the region, organi-zation of a regional meeting of national authorities and experts on marine litter, prep-aration of a regional action plan for the management of marine litter, and participation in a regional cleanup day within the framework of the International Coastal Cleanup Campaign.
24 This regional initiative also provides a platform for 
the establishment of partnerships, cooperation and coordination of activities for the 
20London Protocol, art. 5 and 6.
21Further information on this Plan is available at www.imo.org/ourwork/environment/pollutionpr
evention/portreceptionfacilities.
22Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-Based 
Activities. The GPA, adopted in 1995, is a programme that addresses the impacts of land-based 
sources and activities on coastal and marine environment and human well-being. Litter is one of nine source categories of the GPA and as such is important for its implementation (UNEP 2009).
23Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Caspian, East Asian Seas, Eastern Africa, Mediterranean, Northwest 
Pacific, Northeast Atlantic, Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, South Asian Seas, Southeast Pacific and Wider Caribbean.
24International Coastal Cleanup (ICC) is the world’s largest volunteer effort to clean up beaches 
and waterways, with its many global public and private partners. The ICC is organized by Ocean Conservancy (a US-based NGO) and has been operating since 1986. It annually hosts cleanup activities around the world. In 2012, the ICC mobilized >560,000 volunteers to clean coastal beaches and inland waterways in 97 countries and locations, and a total of 4.5 million kg of trash were collected on the shoreline of 28,485 km (Ocean Conservancy 2013).403 15 Regulation and Management of Marine Litter 
control and sustainable management of marine litter. The main partners include 
Regional Sea Conventions and Action Plans, government representatives, UN agen-cies, relevant bodies, donor agencies, the private sector and NGOs (UNEP 2009).
UNEP/IOC Guidelines on Surveying and Monitoring of Marine Litter
The UNEP developed, in cooperation with the intergovernmental Oceanographic 
Commission (IOC), guidelines on surveying and monitoring of marine litter in order to provide a long-term platform for scientific monitoring. Four sets of opera-tional guidelines were developed: comprehensive assessments of beach, benthic and floating litter, and rapid assessments of beach litter. The first three sets target the collection of highly resolved data to support the development and/or evaluation of mitigation strategies, while the last aims to raise public awareness of and edu-cate about marine litter issues (Cheshire et al. 2009).
UNEP Guidelines on the Use of Market-Based and Economic Instruments
The UNEP developed guidelines on the use of market-based and economic instru-
ments. This report serves as a practical reference to decision makers on how to select, apply and implement related economic tools. Tools include deposit-refund programs on plastic and glass bottles, plastic bag tax, incentives to fishers for reporting and removing debris, subsidies, tourist taxes, car park fees, and water -
front business charges (Ten Brink et al. 2009; Newman et al. 2015).
UNEP/FAO Abandoned, Lost or Otherwise Discarded Fishing Gear
A report commissioned by the UNEP and Food Agriculture Organization (FAO) 
identified reasons for fishing gear being abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded, reviewed existing measures to reduce derelict fishing gear, and proposed recom-mendations for future action (Macfadyen et al. 2009). A variety of existing meas-
ures have been presented, including gear marking, port-state measures,
25 onshore 
collection, payment for retrieved gear, better locating and reporting lost gear, dis-posal and recycling, and awareness raising schemes.
Honolulu Strategy
The UNEP and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 
co-organized the Fifth International Marine Debris Conference in 2011, where the Honolulu Strategy was formulated. This strategy can be regarded as a global 
25Port state measures help to address illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing, which is 
a significant contributor to derelict fishing gear problems.404 C.-L Chen
framework on possible actions to combat marine litter. It contains three goals, 19 
strategies and numerous specific actions, serving as a useful and practical reference for concerned parties to take actions at national levels (UNEP/NOAA 2011).
UNEP Global Partnership of Marine Litter
The most recent initiative was to establish a Global Partnership of Marine Litter 
(GPML) in June 2012 by the UNEP. The GPML builds on the Honolulu Strategy. It is a global partnership, acting as a “coordinating forum” for all stakeholders (international, regional, national and local organizations) working in the area of marine litter prevention and management. The forum assists stakeholders to com-plement each other’s efforts, to avoid duplication and to optimize the efficiency and efficacy of their resources.

15.2.2.2  Regional Instruments
EU PRF DirectiveIn response to MARPOL 73/78, which requires party states to ensure the provi-
sion of adequate PRFs, the EU adopted the Port Reception Facility (PRF) Directive aimed at reducing the input of ship-generated waste to the sea. The directive came into force in 2002 and key requirements include: member states are obliged to ensure the availability of PRFs to meet the needs of ships, ports to develop and implement a waste reception and handling plan, a reporting requirement for the master of a ship regarding the delivery of waste, implementation of a cost- recovery 
system, and establishment of an enforcement scheme (EU 2000). A study by the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) shows that there was an increase in the-total delivery from 2004 to 2008 for oily waste and from 2004 to 2009 for garbage for European ports and the decrease, experienced in 2009 and 2010, for oily waste and garbage, respectively, is thought to be a result of the financial crisis and thus a decrease in the number of calls to the ports (ship/cargo traffic) (EMSA 2012).
EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive
Multiple initiatives exist to tackle marine debris in the EU. Among them, perhaps 
the most relevant is the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) (EU 2008), the environmental pillar of the EU Integrated Maritime Policy. This directive is an integral policy instrument for the protection of the marine environment for the European Community, following an ecosystem-based, adaptive and integrated 
26Further information on the GPML is available at www.gpa.unep.org/index.php/global- 
partnership-on-marine-litter .405 15 Regulation and Management of Marine Litter 
approach to the management of human activities, which have an impact on the 
marine environment. The directive establishes a framework, within which member states shall take necessary measures to achieve or maintain good environmental status (GES) in the marine environment by 2020.
27 Marine litter is listed as the 
tenth of 11 qualitative descriptors for determining GES, which states that the prop-erties and quantities of marine litter do not cause harm to the coastal and marine environment.
28
To achieve GES, each member state should define GES as well as environ-
mental targets and put in place its own marine strategy to protect its waters. In relation to this, two criteria and associated indicators for marine debris that define GES have been identified, serving as a reference for member states to fol-low. One criterion is characteristics of litter in the marine and coastal environ-ment, and the associated indicators are trends in the amount of litter on beaches, in the water column and on the seafloor as well as trends in the amount, distribu-tion and where possible, composition of microparticles (particularly microplas-tics). The other criterion deals with the impacts of litter on marine life, and the associated indicator is marine litter taken up by marine organisms (EU 2010). Furthermore, the Technical Group on Marine Litter was established to support member states by providing technical and scientific recommendations for the implementation of MSFD requirements with regard to marine litter. The group continues to work on, among other concerns, harmonizing monitoring tools (protocols) and strategies, defining and quantifying harm to the marine environ-ment, assessing land- and sea-based sources from which marine litter enters the sea including riverine inputs, and developing a common understanding of appro-priate operational/environmental targets (Galgani et al. 2013).
EU Initiatives on Land-Based Waste Management
The EU has a wide range of initiatives on land-based waste management, which 
could have a significant impact on the amount of waste in the marine environ-ment. For example, the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive outlines a range of requirements to reduce the impact of packaging waste on the environment. It contains provisions on the prevention of packaging waste, on the re-use of packag-ing and on the recovery and recycling of packaging waste (Interwies et al. 2013). 
Other initiatives include the Waste Framework Directive, the Landfill Directive and the Urban Waste Water Directive.
27The MSFD, art. 1.
28Annex I of the MSFD. The remaining descriptors include, to name a few, biological diversity, 
non-indigenous species, populations of commercially exploited fish and shellfish, eutrophication, 
introduction of energy.406 C.-L Chen
Helsinki Convention and Its Associated Initiatives
The 1992 Helsinki Convention29 is a regional instrument aimed at protecting the 
marine environment of the whole Baltic Sea area, including inland waters as well 
as the seawater itself and the seabed. Its Annex IV (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) contains Regulation 4 (Application of the Annexes of MARPOL 73/78) and Regulation 6 (Mandatory discharge of all wastes to a port reception facility), which can be used in the context of marine litter. According to Regulation 4 con-tracting parties shall apply the provisions of Annexes I–V of MARPOL 73/78. According to Regulation 6 ships shall discharge all ship-generated wastes before leaving port, which are not allowed to be discharged into the sea in the Baltic Sea in accordance with MARPOL 73/78 and the convention. In relation to this, the Commission (HELCOM
30) has approved the strategy for PRFs for ship-generated 
wastes (also known as the Baltic Strategy). This strategy comprises a set of meas-ures and regulations with the main goals to ensure ships’ compliance with global and regional discharge regulations and to eliminate illegal discharges of all wastes from all ships. Over 210 PRFs are provided in ports located around the Baltic Sea. To encourage their use, a “no-special-fee” system has been designed, by which disposal fees are included in port charges (HELCOM 2012).
In addition, the Baltic Sea Action Plan adopted by the HELCOM includes an 
agreement to raise awareness of the negative environmental and economic effects of marine litter in the marine environment, including effects of “ghost fishing” of derelict fishing gear (BSAP 2007).
Recently, Ministerial Declaration 2013 was adopted at the HELCOM 
Copenhagen Ministerial Meeting. It was agreed to prevent and reduce marine litter from land- and sea-based sources, causing harmful impacts on coastal and marine habitats and species, and negative impacts on various economic sectors, such as fish-eries, shipping or tourism, and decided to develop a regional action plan by 2015 at the latest with the aim of achieving a significant quantitative reduction of marine lit-ter by 2025, compared to 2015, and to prevent harm to the coastal and marine envi-ronment (HELCOM 2013). It was specifically agreed that the regional action plan on marine litter should allow to, among others, carry out concrete measures for pre-vention and reduction of marine litter from its main sources, develop and test tech-nology for removal of microplastics and nano-particles in municipal waste water treatment plants by 2020, develop common indicators and associated targets related to quantities, composition, sources and pathway of marine litter.
OSPAR Initiatives on Monitoring Marine Litter
Since 1998, OSPAR has monitored levels of beach litter (OSPAR 2010a). A pilot 
project (2000–2006) on monitoring marine beach litter in the OSPAR region 
29Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area, known as 
Helsinki Convention.
30HELCOM is the governing body of the Helsinki Convention.407 15 Regulation and Management of Marine Litter 
using the standardized method was conducted (OSPAR 2007). The guideline for 
monitoring marine litter on the beaches in the OSPAR Maritime Area was further 
adopted in 2010, providing practical advice, especially with standardized method-ology and a photographic guide, for determining the nature and amount of litter (OSPAR 2010b).
In addition, monitoring of plastic ingestion by northern fulmar (Fulmarus gla-
cialis) has been implemented by OSPAR (van Franeker et al. 2011). An Ecological Quality Objective (EcoQO) has been established that <10 % of northern fulmars should have >0.1 g plastics particles in the stomach samples of 50–100 beach ful-mars from each of the 4–5 areas of the North Sea over a period ≥5 years (OSPAR 2010a). Meeting this objective would indicate a reduction of litter at sea. Between 2002 and 2006, the stomachs of 1090 beached fulmars from the North Sea were analyzed. The proportion of fulmars with >0.1 g plastic in the stomach ranged from 45 to >60 %. To meet the EcoQO, refinements may be needed on the imple-mentation of the EU Directive on Port Reception Facilities and MARPOL Annex V , as well as specific measures on lost fisheries materials (OSPAR 2010a).
OSPAR Fishing for Litter
In 2007, OSPAR published Guidelines for the implementation of Fishing for 
Litter (FFL) projects in the OSPAR area. FFL has two main aims: first the phys-ical removal of marine litter from the seabed (Fig. 15.1) and, second, to raise awareness within the fishing industry that it is not acceptable to throw litter overboard. Participating vessels are given large bags to store marine litter that collects in their nets during normal fishing activities. The concept of FFL has received support within the fishing industry with increasing numbers of vessels participating in this activity over the past seven years (OSPAR 2010a). Indeed, the 210 vessels registered for the FFL initiative in Scotland landed >700 t of marine litter at the participating harbors between 2011 and 2014 (KIMO 2014).

In the light of recent weight estimates of 268,940 t of litter adrift in the oceans 
(Eriksen et al. 2014) this initiative could significantly help to reduce marine lit-ter (although this figure did not include litter on the seabed). FFL initiatives are currently also realized in The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, England, Ireland, Italy and Sweden.
Barcelona Convention
The Barcelona Convention
31 is a regional instrument aimed at protecting and pro-
moting sustainable development of the Mediterranean marine and coastal environ-
ment. It was adopted in 1976 and amended in 1995 by the parties to the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP).
32 Seven protocols to the convention establish 
the MAP legal framework and address specific aspects of conservation. The one most relevant to marine litter is the Land-based Sources and Activities Protocol (LBS Protocol). It states that parties undertake to eliminate pollution deriving from land-based sources and activities, in particular to phase out inputs of the sub-stances that are toxic, persistent and liable to bioaccumulate listed in its Annex I,
33 
including litter. In addition, the Dumping Protocol has relevance to marine litter. It states that dumping of wastes and other matter is prohibited, except for dredged material, food waste, platforms and other man-made structures, and inert geologi-cal materials.
34
CCAMLR Marine Debris Program
The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Resources (CCAMLR) 
has initiated the Marine Debris Program in its convention area. Specific measures were employed to reduce the amount of debris entering the marine system and to mitigate its impacts. The measures include monitoring marine debris, addressing the risk associated with entanglement of marine mammals in plastic packaging bands and the injury to seabirds caused by the discharge of hooks in offal, and educating fishers and fishing vessel operators about the potential impact of marine debris on marine wildlife. Members annually submit information on marine debris beach surveys, debris associated with seabird colonies, entanglements of marine mammals, and seabirds and marine mammals soiled with oil.

15.2.2.3  National Instruments
US Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act (MPPRCA)The MPPRCA of 1987 is the national legislation of MARPOL Annex V (UNEP 
2005). The Interagency Marine Debris Coordinating Committee (IMDCC) estab-lished by this Act engages in a holistic approach to marine litter. The committee develops and recommends comprehensive and multi-disciplinary approaches to reduce the sources and adverse impacts of marine debris on the nation’s marine and coastal environment, natural resources, human health, public safety and the economy. The committee consists of several stakeholder agencies,
36 ensuring that 
these agencies increase their coordination to address marine debris (NOAA 2012).
US Marine Debris Program
The Marine Debris Program (MDP) is a national program to investigate and solve 
the problems that stem from marine debris, in order to protect and conserve the nation’s marine environment, natural resources, industries, economy and people. It offers a holistic approach to marine litter and was established by the Marine Debris Research, Prevention, and Reduction Act of 2006 (MDRPRA), which was amended by the Marine Debris Act Amendments in 2012. The MDP serves as a centralized capability within NOAA, supporting national and international pro-grams to research, prevent, and reduce the impacts of marine debris, coordinating activities within NOAA and with other federal agencies, as well as using partner -
ships to support projects carried out by state and local agencies, tribes, NGOs, aca-demia and industry. The MDP has sponsored numerous programs, including Fishing for Energy, international coastal cleanups, monitoring and assessment pro-jects, and collaboration with UNEP to provide technical assistance to countries in the wider Caribbean region. Among them, the project of Fishing for Energy was launched in 2008 and provided fishers no‐cost disposal service for derelict fishing gear and recycled and converted it into renewable energy (Barry 2010).
37 Until 
May 2014, >1.1 million kg of fishing gear were collected at rubbish bins placed in 41 communities across the country. This generated enough electricity to power 183 homes for one year (NFWF 2014).
US National Marine Debris Monitoring Program
The National Marine Debris Monitoring Program (NMDMP) was developed to 
standardize marine debris data collection in the US by using a scientifically valid protocol to determine marine debris status and trends. This program was conducted 
36NOAA serves as the Chair.
37Other initiatives under the MDP are available at www.marinedebris.noaa.gov .410 C.-L Chen
over a five-year period between 2001 and 2006. The results indicate that land-based 
sources of marine debris account for 49 % of the debris surveyed nationally, in com-parison to 18 % from ocean-based and 33 % from general sources (Sheavly 2010).
US Legislations Relevant to Marine Litter
Other legislations of relevance to marine litter could have a significant impact on 
the amount of waste in the ocean. For example, the Shore Protection Act aims to minimize trash, medical debris, and other harmful material from being deposited into coastal waters as a result of inadequate waste handling procedures by vessels transporting waste. The Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Act aims to reduce the risk of diseases to users of the coastal recreation waters.

UK Legislations on Garbage from Ships and PRFs
In the UK, the national legislation of Annex V is the Merchant Shipping 
(Prevention of Pollution by Sewage and Garbage from Ships) Regulation 2008 and the Merchant Shipping and Fishing Vessels (Port Waste Reception Facilities) Regulations 2003 and amendments. The former contains provisions on garbage disposal restriction, garbage management plans and record books, inspection, detention and offences. The latter requires all ports, terminals, harbors and mari-nas to provide adequate reception facilities for waste and prepare a waste manage-ment plan.

UK Beach Cleanup and Awareness Campaigns
Numerous cleanup and awareness campaigns have been carried out in the UK, 
including the Marine Conservation Society’s ‘Beachwatch’ and ‘Adopt a Beach’ campaigns (MCS 2013; UNEP 2005), and the Forth Estuary Forum’s Coastal Litter campaign (Storrier and McGlashan 2006).
Scotland Marine Litter Strategy and National Litter Strategy
The Scottish Government and Marine Scotland recently initiated a process to 
advance the Marine Litter Strategy and the National Litter Strategy to jointly man-age litter in Scotland’s terrestrial (including inland waters), coastal and marine environments. Both strategies were initiated in response to the MSFD, cover the

period 2012–2020 and seek to prevent and/or reduce the incidence of litter through 
a combination of approaches: education and awareness, infrastructure and tools, and enforcement and deterrence (The Scottish Government 2013).
South Korea Initiatives on Marine Litter
Since 1999, South Korea has begun to develop comprehensive and field-oriented strat-
egies to address marine litter at the national level. Diverse initiatives were put forward, including: cleanup operations, recycling or environmentally friendly disposal of mate-rial collected, underwater marine debris removal programs, development of a practi-cal integrated system of marine debris, river basin marine debris management systems, a fishing gear buyback program, a national coastal monitoring and education system on marine debris, and relevant legal and institutional restructuring (Jung et al. 2010). In addition, South Korea introduced a gear-marking initiative in 2006, which helps to identify owners or users of the marked fishing gear and thus contributes to preventing fisheries-related marine litter being abandoned (Macfadyen et al. 2009).
The practical integrated system started in 1999 and aimed to reduce marine lit-
ter through technological innovations in prevention, deep-water survey, removal, treatment and recycling. For example, a floating debris containment boom was developed to prevent floating debris from entering the coastal waters through riv-ers or channels. Deep-water survey equipment (termed “Tow-Sled”) was designed to examine benthic deep-sea derelict fishing gear at depths of 500–1000 m, which was adequate for the East Sea of Korea where the steep slope of theseabed pro-vides a suitable habitat for snow crabs (Jung et al. 2010).
The fishing gear buyback program encouraged fishers to collect fishing gear or 
other marine debris (excluding that generated by the fishers’ own ships) during fishing by offering monetary rewards based on the amount of debris collected (Cho 2009). The program has generated desirable results: between 2004 and 2008 almost 30,000 t of litter were collected and there was an annual increase in the amount of litter col-lected from 2,819 t in 2004 to 8,797 t in 2008 (Noh et al. 2010). In addition, the cost of this program (€ 1.5 million) was less than half of the cost incurred if the same vol-
ume of litter had been collected directly by the government (€ 3.1 million). The coastal 
cleanup programe was carried out at ports and harbors, seabed areas and coastline. It has provided supplementary job opportunities for local residents (mainly senior citi-zens): >46,000 residents were hired as workers (Han et al. 2010).
As for legal and institutional restructuring, the “National Basic Plan for the Marine 
Debris Management” was institutionalized in 2008 by most of the concerned central government agencies (Jung et al. 2010). The First Basic Plan to Manage Marine Debris was established for the period from 2009 to 2013 with a budget of ca € 45 billion (Jang 
and Song 2013). This plan is referring the Marine Environment Management Law as its legal base
40 and sets two quantitative goals: reduce the amount of marine debris annu-

ally entering the ocean from 159,800 t (2007) to 127,840 t (2013) and increase the col-
lection rate from 34 % (2007) to 45 % (2013). However, a study showed that this marine debris policy is not successful in dealing with the marine debris issue since the policy focuses on collecting debris already at sea rather than preventing it from entering the ocean initially and it is almost impossible to measure the debris flow, given count-less non-point sources (Jang and Song 2013).
Taiwan Legislations Relevant to Marine Litter
A comprehensive national program to assess or remediate marine litter is cur -
rently not available in Taiwan, although marine litter is pervasive along its coast-
line. No clear integral mechanism exists for solving marine litter problems. Regulations governing the marine litter disposal fall under the management bod-ies. Specifically, the Fishing Harbor Act prohibits the discharge of litter to harbor areas. The Commercial Port Act regulates waste discharges at PRFs. The Marine Pollution Control Act is the national legislation of MARPOL 73/78 and London Protocol. The act regulates that waste shall remain on board or be discharged into reception facilities, unless specific conditions apply for legal discharge. However, thus far, specific conditions have yet to be promulgated. In addition, while the authority has already transposed the revised MARPOL Annex V into national law in 15 April 2013, no penalties in breach of this rule exist. Therefore, the relevant regulations have no deterrent effects and are difficult to enforce.
Taiwan Initiatives on Land-Based Waste Management
The plastic restriction policy and the compulsory garbage sorting policy are two 
major initiatives on land-based waste management. These two initiatives were intended to reduce the amount of waste and have a significant impact on the reduc-tion of the volume of plastic waste. Since 1997, Taiwan has engaged in a waste-recycling campaign by collaborating with communities, recycling enterprises, municipal trash collection teams and the recycling fund. In 2006, a compulsory nation-wide garbage sorting program was initiated to further enhance the house-hold recycling rate.
41 The recycling rate of 38 % in 2010 was high, a 100 % 
increase compared to 2002 (TEPA 2010). In 2002, the government started to implement the plastic restriction policy. Measures include restrictions of the use of plastic shopping bags and disposable plastic tableware in all government agencies and public facilities (e.g. department stores, shopping centers, supermarkets, con-venience stores). Within three years of this policy’s implementation, the number

ies, tires, lubricants, IT objects, house appliances (televisions, washing machines etc.) and light 
bulbs.413 15 Regulation and Management of Marine Litter 
and the weight of plastic carrier bags were reduced by 58 and 68 %, respectively. 
In addition, >80 % of shoppers carried shopping bags compared to <20 % prior to the policy, indicating that this policy has initiated a behavioral change toward the use of fewer plastic bags (TEPA 2011).
Taiwan Coastal Cleanup Activities
The project of cleaning the coastal environment has been in place since 1997 with 
an aim to keep the coastal environment tidy, particularly the relatively populated areas, by conducting regular cleanup activities and setting up adequate reception facilities. However, this project did not involve monitoring marine debris. In gen-eral, beach litter surveys around Taiwan have been conducted by civil groups (e.g. Taiwan Ocean Cleanup Alliance) without formal long-term commitments by the government. However, the surveyed areas were limited to a few coastal locations and the survey results were not considered by relevant authorities.
15.3  Types of Management Measures to Combat Marine 
Litter
It should be noted that the preceding description of international, regional and 
national instruments tackling marine litter presents a representative snapshot of a wide range of relevant instruments, rather than an exhaustive list. While such representative information is not complete, it shows that a basic framework for addressing marine litter is in place (Fig. 15.2) and provides an overall picture of the current management measures. Based on their principle purposes, the meas-ures can be divided into four categories: preventive, mitigating, removing and behavior-changing (Table 15.2).
15.3.1  Preventive Measures
Preventive measures focus on avoiding the generation of debris, or preventing debris from entering the sea. Measures of this type include source reduction, waste reuse and recycling, waste conversion to energy,
42 portreception facilities, gear 
marking, debris contained at points of entry into receiving waters and various waste management initiatives on land. Product modification and improvement (e.g. through eco design) is an important method for source reduction. A variety of 
42But during this process toxins are produced and even if they are filtered the toxic filters have to 
be disposed of.414 C.-L Chen
source reduction schemes are available, such as designing packaging such that the 
product can be refilled (e.g. shampoo bottles), maintaining and repairing durable products (e.g. bicycles), developing more concentrated products (e.g. laundry detergent) and electric messaging (Vaughn 2009). Other methods include the development of packaging material that is made from sustainable resources, the Table 15.2  Management schemes addressing marine litter

design of push-tap opening of metal beverage cans43 and the design of lids of bev-
erage bottles or containers attached to bottles with a leash (Gold et al. 2013). 
Restriction of the use of plastic bags is one of such measures, which is significant 
in the reduction of plastic waste. Bangladesh was the first nation to outlaw poly-thene bags in 2002 followed by Myanmar, China and a number of African coun-tries including Eritrea, Mali, Mauritania, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya. What is more, the production of plastic bags has become a criminal 
offence in Mauritania, Mali, Somalia and Rwanda, which even searches the lug-gage of visitors upon arrival at its airports.
Based on the hierarchy of waste management, the strategies of preventing 
wastes from being formed in the first place is of paramount importance as are recycling, resource recovery and waste-to-energy approaches as less waste is gen-erated and relatively low risks and costs are associated with waste management, compared to other strategies such as treatment and disposal (Cheremisinoff 2003). 
In this regard, extended producer responsibility (EPR) should be well established since it is a strategy to prevent wastes at source, promote product design for the environment and support the achievement of public recycling and materials man-agement goals (OECD 2001) (see also Newman et al. 2015). Currently, consumers 
often do not have a chance to select a more environmentally friendly packaged/produced good as they are all packaged/manufactured with plastics. With EPR established, producers accept significant responsibility for the treatment or dis-posal of post-consumer products. It may take the form of a reuse, buy-back, or recycling program. The EU Waste Framework Directive establishes EPR and describes drivers for sustainable production taking into account the full life cycle of products (EU 2013). This directive encourages member states to take legislative or non-legislative measures in order to strengthen re-use and the prevention, recy-cling and other recovery operations of waste.
15.3.2  Mitigating Measures
Mitigating measures concern the ways that litter is disposed of. Methods of debris disposal are employed to minimize its adverse impact on the marine environment. These measures are largely command and control regulations, and overlap with preventive ones if they also involve preventing certain types of debris from enter -
ing the sea. Examples of such measures include prohibition of certain types of lit-ter (e.g. plastics) discharged into seas or to coastal landfills, dumping regulations if dumping is allowed, prohibition of certain types of wastes discharged into eco-logically sensitive areas, specifications of the distances from the land and of waste 
43As opposed to the design of pull-tap opening, this design prevents taps from separating from 
beverage containers and thus the two could be retrieved together for recycling. It is noted that 
taps separating from cans could conveniently be thrown away and easily become marine litter items.416 C.-L Chen
status for disposal (e.g. waste discharged ≥12 miles from the land and wastes not 
containing substances harmful to the marine environment), and prohibition of cer -
tain activities at sea (e.g. incineration of wastes at sea).
15.3.3  Removing Measures
Removing measures aim to remove debris already present in the marine environ-ment. Beach cleanups are commonly employed for this but are time-consuming, costly (see Newman et al. 2015) and only capture a fraction of the overall debris. UK municipalities, for example, spend approximately €18 million each year removing beach litter, representing a 37 % increase in cost over the past decade (Mouat et al. 2010). In addition to beach cleanups, a few initiatives have employed divers to collect and monitor benthic marine debris, for example, in Hawaii (Donohue et al. 2001) and the Florida Keys (Watson 2012). In Fishing for Litter initiatives fishers remove all litter items collected during normal fishing opera-tions and deposit them safely on the quayside to then be collected for disposal. Gear retrieval programs encourage fishers to retrieve derelict fishing gear at sea during fishing operations (e.g. Noh et al. 2010; Watson 2012). While monitoring 
marine debris is concerned with recording information on debris types, amounts and sources, it can be classified as removing measure since it often concomitantly involves the removal of debris. Monitoring is instrumental in devising effective management strategies to prevent specific types of litter from entering the sea. Importantly, long-term monitoring programmes enable us to assess the effective-ness of legislation and coastal management polices (Rees and Pond 1995) and have the potential to help management at individual sites and to generate large-scale pollution maps (from regional to global) to inform decision makers (Ribic et al. 2010).
15.3.4  Behavior-Changing Measures
Behavior-changing measures seek to influence behavior such that people engage in activities that help toreduce marine debris. Behavior-changing schemes are cross-cutting and aid the development and implementation of the above-mentioned three types of measures. Such schemes aim to encourage people to embrace the notion of waste as a resource and choose the products that generate lower quantities of litter (preventive), dispose of waste in a more environmentally sound way (mitigat-ing) and participate in beach cleanups (removal). Education campaigns (Hartley et al. 2015), activities raising awareness such as Fishing for Litter initiatives and provision of incentives are examples of such measures. Behavior-changing schemes are fundamental in addressing marine debris at its root.417 15 Regulation and Management of Marine Litter 
15.4  Potential Gaps in Marine Litter Management
As previously described, a basic regulatory and management framework address-
ing marine litter is in place and a number of regions and countries have taken management measures to tackle the issues. A few cases indicate that some of the management measures have generated desirable results, such as South Korea’s fishing gear buyback programme, Taiwan’s plastic restriction policy and compul-sory garbage sorting policy, US Fish for Energy, OSPAR Fishing for Litter, EU PRF Directive, HELCOM Baltic Strategy (see previous sections). Despite this, marine litter continues to increase worldwide: on shorelines, in estuaries and man-groves, in oceanic gyres, and on seafloors, signalling that marine litter remains an abiding problem, particularly with respect to microplastics (Barnes et al. 2009; UNEP 2011; Lima et al. 2014; Mohamed Nor and Obbard 2014; Pham et al. 2014; 
Lusher 2015). There are complex reasons for this and, it is possible to identify 
a number of gaps in the current framework that prevent the effective control of marine litter.
•	Limits of existing instruments in addressing plastic marine litter
 Gold et al. (2013) identified a number of limitations in existing international 
instruments in addressing marine litter, including their insufficient scope with respect to the main sources of plastic pollution, exemptions and lack of enforce-ment standards. For instance, UNCLOS acknowledges the existence of land-based sources but simply requests that countries address the problem through domestic means.
44 MARPOL Annex V exempts accidental loss of disposal of 
plastic resulting from damage to the ship or its equipment,45 as well as ships 
<400 GT, a category to which most of the fishing vessels belong, from recoding garbage discharge operations in Garbage Record Books (GRBs).
46 However, 
GRBs are of utmost importance to ensure compliance with discharge regula-tions (HELCOM 2012).
 The lack of enforcement standards can be found in the terms used in the legal instruments. UNCLOS, for instance, requires only that nations “shall endeavor” to use the “best practical means” to reduce marine pollution “in accordance” with their capabilities. Similarly, the Helsinki Convention requires contracting parties to take “all appropriate” measures to prevent and eliminate pollution. This leaves room for interpretation for countries with differing legal systems, environmental circumstances and capacities (Gold et al. 2013).
•	Deficiencies in the legislation and a lack of implementation and enforcement of regulations and management measures
 The implementation and enforcement of regulations and management measures at national levels is a key component to combat marine litter. However, a number 
44UNCLOS, art. 207 (concerning pollution from land-based sources).
45Revised Annex V , reg. 7.
46Revised Annex V , reg. 10.418 C.-L Chen
of cases below show that international initiatives have not yet been transposed 
into national management schemes; or where they have there is a lack of enforcement, insufficient implementation, insufficient penalties to deter viola-tors, or a lack of clarity in legislation leaving room for interpretation. These all represent major obstacles to the effective control of marine litter. For instance, the UNEP (2009) pointed out that at the national level, only the Wider Caribbean and Northwest Pacific regions have countries with specific national legislation addressing marine litter. The revised MARPOL Annex V has not yet been trans-posed into national law in countries such as Germany (UBA 2013) and thus there is no legal footing to implement this revised Annex V at the national level. The IMO Global Integrated Shipping Information System (GISIS) shows that there are numerous reported cases of alleged inadequacy of reception facilities.
47 
In the US, as of 1995, <10 % of cases put to trial under MARPOL Annex V have resulted in penalties
48 and each of the penalized cases was fined an average of 
€4,560, an amount far too low to serve as a deterrent (Gold et al. 2013). In 
Taiwan, no penalties exist for the violation of the Annex V . The EU PRF Directive is vague at defining the fee/cost recovery system. The transposition of the directive into national legislation leaves room for different solutions on how to introduce incentives for waste delivery at ports. The use of different waste-fee systems by EU ports creates confusion among ship owners and operators (EMSA 2012; Øhlenschlæger et al. 2013).
•	Poor cooperation and insufficient participation of states in international/regional initiatives
 Despite the fact that numerous international and regional initiatives already exist and provide a platform for cooperation and coordination of marine debris issues, a few cases indicate that cooperative action on marine litter has lagged behind, or the participation of states in these initiatives was insufficient. This would leave a loophole in the global/regional efforts, given the fact that marine debris is a transboundary issue. For example, there are no legal instruments in place dedicated to the management of marine litter as yet in the Black Sea, even though the Bucharest Convention
49 contains several articles pertaining to 
marine debris (Interwies et al. 2013). Some regional seas do not even participate in the UNEP Global Initiative, such as west central and southern Africa, north-east Pacific, Pacific and the ROPME
50 sea area (UNEP 2009). Countries border -
ing these regional seas might lack appropriate waste-management schemes because of economic constraints, although a number of African countries have recently banned the use of plastic bags.

•	Insufficient data on marine litter
 Despite the existing schemes against marine litter, our current knowledge of 
the quantities and the degradation of litter in the marine environment and its potential physical and chemical impacts on marine life are scarce (Galgani et al. 2013). Our knowledge gaps in terms of the biological consequences of micro-plastics exposure, economic and social impacts of marine debris have been men-tioned (see other chapters). These gaps hinder the ability to prioritize mitigation efforts and to assess the effectiveness of implementation measures (The Scottish Government 2012). Specific data gaps were identified in a number of studies. 
For instance, very little data exist on quantities, trends, sources and sinks of marine litter in the west Indian Ocean region and very little is known about the extent and nature of the problem in the east Asian Seas region (GESAMP 2010). In European seas, data gaps were identified, including amounts and composi-tion, transport, origin and impacts of marine litter on the seafloor, in the water column and rivers (Interwies et al. 2013). In addition, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities and their contribution to litter generation, quanti-ties and impacts of derelict fishing gear and micro-particles were referred to. Further data are needed in relation to large-scale and long-term monitoring across countries and environments, smaller-scale dynamics that affect plas-tic movement and accumulation, and trophic transfer dynamics of persistent organic pollutants via plastics through the marine food web (USEPA 2011).
15.5  Recommendations
In view of the above and taking into account the relevant information that has been put forth in the literature, recommendations for improvement are made as follows:
•	Development of a new international instrument to tackle the marine litter 
problem
 Given that the scope of existing international law fails to match the scale and severity of the marine litter problem, Gold et al. (2013) urged the global community to develop a new multilateral agreement similar to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. A set of elements were proposed to be included in such an agreement, including regulation of dis-posal of plastic litter from both ocean- and land-based sources, incorporating tracking, monitoring, reporting and enforcement standards and mechanisms, banning the most common or deleterious types of plastic litter, calling for a phase-out of all plastics that are not recycled at a rate of 75 % or higher by a certain date.
•	Amending existing instruments to narrow exceptions and clarify enforcement standards
 Given the long time required to reach and implement a new agreement, Gold et al. (2013) recommended modifications to existing policy to eliminate some of the gaps. For example, amendment of the current vessel size and tonnage 420 C.-L Chen
limitations in Annex V for requirements respecting placards, garbage manage-
ment plans, and garbage record books is recommended so that fewer vessels are exempted.
51 Macfadyen et al. (2009) suggested amending Annex V so as to pro-
vide specific guidance on reasonable accidental losses of fishing gear. Regarding the vague definition of the fee systems in the EU PRF Directive, Øhlenschlæger et al. (2013) recommended implementation of a 100 % indirect fee system
52 for all European ports.
•	Establishment of comprehensive national marine litter programmes
 Marine litter is a transboundary governance problem as it crosses scale, sec-tors and social divisions (Hastings and Potts 2013). To solve this problem, each state should develop a national marine litter programme (or a similar manage-ment scheme). This would constitute a high-level political commitment that could be a driver for relevant actions to be undertaken and ensure that marine litter issues are reflected in all policymaking. Such programmes have the poten-tial to tackle the previously mentioned deficiencies. They should not only aim to reduce litter, but also quantify the sources of litter from land and ocean and promote a culture change with a view to consider “waste as a resource”. To ensure its effective implementation, such programmes should have clear objec-tives, develop an efficient and integrated regulatory and management system, implement a suit of actions related to monitoring and research, infrastructure, education, incentive schemes, and enforcement and compliance, and estab-lish public-private partnership/community involvement. In particular, such programmes should focus on long-range land-based waste management plans that lead to full collection and disposal services since the management of solid wastes on land directly affects quantifies of marine litter (Liffmann et al. 1997).
•	Enhancing participation and cooperation of states in international/regional initiatives
 The transboundary nature of marine litter underlines that the problem is global in scale and international in impact. In this regard, national measures alone are insuf-ficient to control marine debris, and international/regional cooperation is required. An empirical long-term litter monitoring study in the Southern Ocean showed that ocean-based litter monitoring needs to be integrated at an international or regional level (Edyvane et al. 2004). A wide range of international/regional initiatives on marine litter (such as UNEP RSP, GPA and GPML and various regional sea instruments) have established a platform for concerned states to engage in cooper -
ation; participation and cooperation should be enhanced and strengthened both in terms of the number of participating states and the substantiality of cooperation. 
51According to Revised Annex V , reg. 10, ships ≥12 min length are required to display placards, 
ships ≥100 GT to follow garbage management plans, and ships ≥400 GT to use garbage record 
books.
52This fee is paid by all ships calling at a port irrespective of the amount of waste disposed of at 
PRFs. It can effectively prevent cost from becoming a disincentive for using PRFs and has been 
implemented in ports such as Copenhagen (Denmark) and Stockholm (Sweden) (see Newman et al. 2015).421 15 Regulation and Management of Marine Litter 
This would promote a dialogue among states on good practices in marine litter 
management and allow for substantial coordination and cooperation in research and developing and implementing more effective and practical management measures, such as the standardization of litter monitoring methods, the technolo-gies for solid waste management, the waste notification system and the fee sys-tem for ship-generated waste. Moreover, this would help less wealthy countries to advance solid waste and sewage management through technical and financial assistance and training provided by more experienced countries and international organizations (Liffmann et al. 1997).
•	Strengthening management measures on fishing vessels
 Although many studies suggest that fisheries are an important source of marine litter, most fishing vessels are exempt from the discharge regulations of Annex V of MARPOL 73/78 because of their low tonnage. In addition to the previ-ous recommendations to amend Annex V to narrow exceptions, I propose two approaches based on the area where fishing vessels operate. For vessels, which work solely in national waters, management measures at national levels should be specifically devised and strengthened. For example, Murray and Cowie (2011) demonstrated the presence of plastic microfibres shed from fishing net protectors in the intestines of >80 % of the commercially harvested prawns, an issue that could be well addressed by gear regulations. Arthur et al. (2014) found that the number of crabs caught per derelict fishing trap per year ranged from 4 to 76 in selected US coastal waters. This issue could be addressed by designing traps (e.g. escape panels) that allow species to escape when traps become derelict, thus rendering derelict traps “non-fishing”. Kim et al. (2014) estimated that 11,500 t of traps and 38,500 t of gill-nets are abandoned annually in Korean waters and suggested incentive programmes for fishermen to use eco-friendly gear designs.
 In addition, several measures could be adopted, including developing waste recycling practice among fishers, installing adequate PRFs, encouraging envi-ronmental education, promoting lost gear recovery, encouraging the use of environmentally friendly gear, promoting spatial management to reduce gear conflict and improving gear marking (Cho 2009; Macfadyen et al. 2009; Chen and Liu 2013; Gold et al. 2013; Arthur et al. 2014). Some of these measures may also apply to other types of small vessels (e.g. pleasure crafts), which are also exempt from Annex V .
 For vessels operating on the high seas, numerous regional fishery bodies (RFBs)
53 
have been established to manage and conserve fisheries resources based on geo-graphical areas or fish species. They are generally established by coastal states and fishing nations with a common interest in overcoming collective-action prob-lems related to the management of transboundary stocks (Sydnes 2001). Many have management mechanisms in place to regulate fishing activities, such as CCLAMR, International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, 
53A full list of RFBs is available at www.fao.org/fishery/rfb/search/en.422 C.-L Chen
Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, Western and Central Pacific Fisheries 
Commission, Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization, to name but a few. Taking advantage of the fully fledged management mechanisms, RFBs could take further actions to integrate fishery-related debris reduction into their wider man-agement regime. To enable RFBs to adopt appropriate actions, it is advisable that the FAO, the lead organization of fisheries management and conservation, takes a lead in this initiative by providing guidance on effective and practical measures. In relation to this, some progress is being made to deal with derelict fishing gear by proposing a list of recommendations in a UNEP/FAO Technical Paper. The recommendations include both international and national actions, including devel-oping an action plan on adequacy of PRFs for fisheries waste, amending Annex V , and formulating a global action plan to address the waste of fishing gear (Macfadyen et al. 2009). In addition, Gold et al. (2013) suggested that RFBs should adopt management standards to minimize the impacts of gear loss and move toward the replacement of plastic and synthetic gear with biodegradable nets and traps to minimize ghost fishing and entanglement.
15.6  Conclusion
The problem of marine litter is complex, as it is rooted in our prevailing produc-tion and consumption patterns and the way we dispose of and manage waste. Tackling this problem necessitates the inclusion of a vast amount of activities, sectors and sources that cannot be addressed by a single measure. A global reduction of the production of plastic waste/products through extended producer responsibility should be at the heart of all management solutions as this would ultimately be reflected in decreased inputs into our oceans. A variety of instru-ments at international, regional and national levels has been developed. In this chapter, the general mechanisms of instruments were analyzed and a number of them, including specific management measures contained therein, were profiled as illustration. The measures on marine litter are either on a mandatory or volun-tary basis. In addition, based on the principle purposes, management measures were broadly divided into four categories: preventive, mitigating, removing and behavior-changing. This chapter further identified the potential gaps in existing frameworks and offered recommendations for improvement. The recommen-dations include establishment of a new international instrument targeted to the plastic marine litter problem, amending existing instruments to narrow excep-tions and clarify enforcement standards, establishing comprehensive national marine litter programmes, enhancing participation and cooperation of states with regard to international/regional initiatives, and devising measures to prevent marine litter from fishing vessels.
As with other environmental problems, marine litter could be prevented and 
controlled through an effective collaboration of education and outreach pro-grammes, strong regulations and policies, effective enforcement, and adequate 423 15 Regulation and Management of Marine Litter 
support infrastructure. Based on this perspective, I hope that the current regula-
tory and management framework, potential gaps identified and recommendations made, will contribute to better management of marine debris. Last but not least, it is envisaged that through the ongoing efforts to combat marine litter, a shared vision for “litter-free marine environments” would be realized among all of the various actors and stakeholders concerned.

The Contribution of Citizen Scientists

M. Bergmann et al. (eds.), Marine Anthropogenic Litter,  DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-16510-3_16Abstract Citizen science projects are based on volunteer participation of 
untrained citizens who contribute information, data and samples to scientific stud-
ies. Herein we provide an overview of marine litter studies that have been sup-ported by citizen scientists (n = 40) and compare these studies with selected studies conducted by professional scientists (n = 40). Citizen science studies have mainly focused on the distribution and composition of marine litter in the intertidal zone. Studies extended over regional, national and international scales, with time periods generally extending from less than one year to two years. Professional studies have also examined the distribution and composition of marine litter, but from intertidal, subtidal and pelagic zones, with some focus-ing exclusively on microplastics. These studies have been conducted over local, regional and international scales, usually for less than one year each. Both citi-zen science and professional studies on marine litter have been conducted mainly in the northern hemisphere, revealing a lack of information available on coastal regions of the southern hemisphere. A main concern of citizen science studies is the reliability of the collected information, which is why many studies include steps to ensure data quality, such as preparation of clear protocols, training of volunteers, in situ supervision by professional scientists, and revision of samples 
and data. The results of this comparative review confirm that citizen science can be a useful approach to increase the available information on marine litter sources, distribution and ecological impacts. Future studies should strive to incorporate

16.1  Introduction
Large quantities of anthropogenic litter reach the marine environment, where they 
spread throughout all oceans and persist for many years (Derraik 2002; Barnes et al. 2009; Ryan et al. 2009; Eriksen et al. 2014). The accumulation of litter causes diverse impacts on marine biota, such as entanglement (Laist 1997; Moore et al. 2009), ingestion (e.g. van Franeker et al. 2011; Carson 2013; Cole et al. 2013), and dispersal of alien species (Barnes 2002; Masó et al. 2003; Kiessling et al. 2015). The extensive spreading of marine litter, even to the most remote regions of the world’s oceans, makes litter distribution and abundance surveys dif-ficult and time consuming (Ryan et al. 2009; Eriksen et al. 2014). Coastal regions, where a large fraction of marine litter is deposited, receive visits from a wide range of people, including, but not limited to, tourists, fishermen, and schoolchil-dren. Such coastal users have been recruited to support scientific beach surveys to quantify marine litter worldwide (e.g. Ogata et al. 2009; Ribic et al. 2010). These volunteers (here termed “citizen scientists”) (Bonney et al. 2009) have participated 
in the collection, analysis and interpretation of data in a wide range of studies, determining litter distribution and abundance in the marine environment (Lindborg et al. 2012; Smith and Edgar 2014; Thiel et al. 2014).
Herein we provide a review of marine litter studies that have been supported 
by citizen scientists in order to evaluate their contribution to current knowledge on marine litter distribution, abundance, and interaction with marine biota. In par -
ticular, we compare the type and quality of data collected in these citizen science studies with those collected by professional scientists (scientists that have received a formal scientific education). Based on the results of this comparison, we offer recommendations for future marine litter surveys that are supported by citizen scientists.
16.2  Marine Litter Studies Supported by Citizen Scientists
People from a wide range of educational backgrounds have supported scientific studies on marine litter. Their interest to participate in this kind of investigation may vary depending on their own personal motivation, which may include being part of an environmental organization (e.g. marine conservation NGO, girl & boy scouts) or an educational project within a school (Fig. 16.1). For example, beach cleanup 431

campaigns are conducted in many countries, and can be a source of marine litter 
information supported by citizen scientists (e.g. Ribic 1998; Martin 2013).
For this review, marine litter studies were identified by searching the ISI Web 
of Knowledge and Google Scholar databases for papers using the keywords “citizen science” or “volunteer” with “marine litter”, “marine debris” or “plastic debris”. We thoroughly scanned the literature, identifying all studies in which vol-unteers had participated in sampling and/or sample processing. We only selected studies with a main focus on marine litter; studies which coincidentally also report interactions of litter with marine biota were not considered, unless these explicitly focused on litter aspects, such as plastic ingestion and entanglement by seabirds and marine mammals (Moore et al. 2009; van Franeker et al. 2011). At the time 
of writing, 40 marine litter studies were identified, which were based entirely or partly on data or samples contributed by citizen scientists (Appendix 1).Fig. 16.1  Examples of 
citizen scientists participating in studies on marine litter
432 V . Hidalgo-Ruz and M. Thiel
We also selected 40 peer-reviewed articles that were exclusively conducted by 
professional scientists, in order to compare those with and evaluate the impor -
tance, scope and quality of citizen-science studies. For the purpose of this review, 
we only included the most cited papers (according to ISI Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar databases) that have been published during the past 10 years (2004–2014). Keywords used to identify these studies were “marine litter”, “marine debris”, “plastic debris” and “beach survey”. Review articles were not considered for this comparison between citizen science and professional studies (see Appendix 1 for the complete list of selected studies).
16.3  Comparison of Citizen Science and Professional 
Science Studies on Marine Litter
16.3.1  Research Topic
Research on marine litter has focused on six major topics: (1) Distribution and 
composition of marine litter, (2) interaction with marine biota, (3) toxic effects, (4) horizontal and vertical transport, (5) social aspects and (6) degradation of marine plastic litter. The majority of citizen science studies (68 %) examined the spatial distribution and composition of marine litter (Table 16.1). In these cases, citizens participated in beach cleanup activities or beach surveys of marine litter (e.g. Gregory 1991; Storrier et al. 2007), plastic beverage containers (Józwiak 2005) 
and small plastic debris (Hidalgo-Ruz and Thiel 2013). Apart from one study con-ducted by divers in subtidal environments (Smith and Edgar 2014), the intertidal zone was the only sampling zone.
One citizen-science study also covered the open ocean via a drifter experiment 
to investigate the pathways of litter from island areas in Hawaii; citizen scientists reported drifters that had stranded on local shores (Carson et al. 2013).
In most cases, data were registered on datasheets provided by an organization, 
but one study also created a smartphone application, which was used by personal phones and iPods (Martin 2013). Interaction of marine litter with biota was the second most common topic addressed by citizen science studies, but given the overwhelming proportion of studies on the distribution and composition of litter (68 %), this topic represented only 18 % of all studies (Table 16.1). These studies

focused on specific animal groups, mostly vertebrates: seabirds (van Franeker 
et al. 2011; Lindborg et al. 2012), marine mammals (Moore et al. 2009), fish (Carson 2013) and sea turtles (Bjorndal et al. 1994). For example, citizen scien-
tists supported cleanups of derelict crab traps and quantified the species entangled by ghost fishing activity (Anderson and Alford 2014), or information on species 
affected by marine litter was documented on an interactive website (Hong et al. 2013). Other aspects of marine litter were examined in 15 % of all citizen science studies (Table 16.1). Persistent organic pollutants were determined in beached plastic pellets, which were collected by citizens (Ogata et al. 2009; Hirai et al. 2011; Heskett et al. 2012). Transport of marine litter was studied to determine the factors driving marine debris deposition on Hawaiian beaches (Morishige et al. 2007; Carson et al. 2013). A social study examined the behavior, education and 
preference of the general public to reduce littering on beaches (Eastman et al. 
2013). Degradation of marine litter was not addressed by citizen scientists.
A large portion of professional studies was also based on the distribution and 
composition of marine litter (45 % of all studies) (Table 16.1). These studies exam-ined beach litter from the intertidal zone (n =  11) (e.g. McDermid and McMullen 
2004; Claessens et al. 2011), seafloor debris from the subtidal zone (n =  4) (e.g. 
Katsanevakis and Katsarou 2004), and pelagic plastic litter from the open ocean (n = 6) (Lattin et al. 2004; Pichel et al. 2007). In contrast to citizen science stud-
ies, a considerable number of the professional studies focused exclusively on micro-plastics (n = 11) (e.g. Thompson et al. 2004; Ng and Obbard 2006; Browne et al. 
2010). This difference is likely due to the advanced techniques required for proper identification of microplastics (especially the smaller fraction of microplastics, 1 μm–1 mm; Löder and Gerdts 2015), which is unfeasible in citizen science stud-
ies (Hidalgo-Ruz and Thiel 2013). The interaction of marine litter with biota was addressed by a high proportion of studies (35 % of all studies) (Table 16.1). These studies focused mainly on plastic ingestion by both invertebrates and vertebrates (e.g. Graham and Thompson 2009; Boerger et al. 2010), but also on entanglement 
of pinnipeds in marine litter (Page et al. 2004; Boren et al. 2006), and on the impact of lost fishing gear on coral reefs (Chiappone et al. 2005). Toxic effects, transport, social aspects and degradation of marine litter were examined by 20 % of the pro-
fessional studies (Table 16.1). These focused on the quantification of persistent organic pollutants (POP’s) in plastics (Rios et al. 2007, 2010; Teuten et al. 2007), the 
temporal variability and dynamics of marine debris at the sea surface (e.g. Martinez et al. 2009; Law et al. 2010), the socio-economic characteristics of beach users and littering (Santos et al. 2005), and the relationship between composition, surface 
texture, and degradation of plastics (Corcoran et al. 2009).
16.3.2  Spatial Scale
Considering that marine litter is a global issue, the collection of data over extensive spatial scales is particularly important (Galgani et al. 2015). Professional research can 434 V . Hidalgo-Ruz and M. Thiel
address this issue, but requires a work-intensive sampling effort or the use of expen -
sive equipment, such as buoys, aircraft, submersible vehicles and satellites (e.g. 
Pichel et  al. 2007 ; Maximenko et  al. 2012 ). These types of sophisticated surveys 
might be too expensive for citizen science projects, but with a reasonable budget, 
citizen science offers the opportunity to establish extensive networks of sampling sta -
tions on the ground. Citizen science studies have been conducted on the local (one 
sampling site), regional (several sampling sites), national and even international scale 
(Table  16.2). The more extensive citizen science studies were conducted by “The 
International Pellet Watch” project (see Ogata et  al. 2009 ; Hirai et  al. 2011 ; Heskett 
et al. 2012 ), in which volunteers from 17 countries have collected pellets from local 
beaches and sent them to Tokyo for laboratory analyses. This project has monitored 
the pollution status of persistent organic pollutants in the oceans since 2005, extend -
ing their sampling locations to several new places (Fig.  16.2).
In contrast, professional studies have been conducted relatively homogene -
ously over all spatial scales, with the exception of national surveys, which only 
represented two (5  %) of all professional studies (Table  16.2). Examples of local 
studies include Corcoran et  al. (2009 ) on plastic degradation on Kauai, Hawaii, 
Graham and Thompson ( 2009 ) on the ingestion of plastics by sea cucumbers, and

at Cassino Beach, Rio Grande City, Brazil. Regional research examples are from Costa et al. (2010) on the distribution and composition of debris on beaches from Northeast Brazil, and Chiappone et al. (2005) on the impact of lost fishing gear on coral reefs in Florida, USA. A worldwide coverage was achieved by Browne et al. (2011) who determined the microplastics abundance (mainly from cloth fibres) at shorelines of 18 countries.
16.3.3  Temporal Scale
Citizen-science studies require a lot of organization. Accordingly, short-term studies are expected to be the most common among all citizen-science studies. Nevertheless, the time range of citizen-science studies vary from single events, up to a study of 27 years by van Franeker et al. (2011), who determined the abundance of ingested plastics by northern fulmars Fulmarus glacialis from the North Sea, as an indication of litter contamination. The majority of citizen-science studies (63 %) cover time periods ranging from less than 1–2 years, followed by studies between 5 and 10 years (20 %) (Table 16.3). Professional studies varied between single events up to a study on microplastics that compared recent samples with samples taken 40 years ago (Thompson et al. 2004). Interestingly, many professional studies were conducted only once, i.e. they spanned less than one year (53 %), whereas others ranged from 1 to 2 years (10 %) and 2 to 5 years (10 %), respectively. Three pro-fessional observational studies did not report the temporal scale of the investigation (Corcoran et al. 2009; Costa et al. 2010; Claessens et al. 2011) (Table 16.3).
16.3.4  Regions Where Studies Have Been Done
The problem of marine litter is widespread and has caused concern worldwide. However, global knowledge about marine litter is limited, because the majority of both citizen-science and professional studies on marine litter have been conducted in the northern hemisphere. Most citizen-science studies have been reported from Asia and South America (Fig. 16.3a). Professional studies have been conducted

mainly in Europe and the North Pacific Ocean (Hawaii and the North Pacific gyre) 
(Fig. 16.3b). This reveals a lack of information on coastal regions of the southern 
hemisphere, such as Africa and South America, except Chile. However, in the near future, the combination of citizen-science and professional studies can be the key to achieving global knowledge about litter sources and quantities, especially for regions of the world where this information is still needed. Therefore, citizen science studies could be a good approach to help filling the last missing gaps on the world map.
16.4  Data Collection and Quality Control  
of Citizen-Science Studies
A main concern of citizen-science studies is whether the collected data are reliable and 
comparable to professional studies. Four main aspects need to be considered in order to ensure or improve data quality: (1) preparation of easy and straightforward protocols, 
Fig. 16.3  World map with representation of the number of studies per ecoregion (limits of 
ecoregions after Spalding et al. 2007), for (a) citizen-science and (b) professional studies437
16 Citizen Scientists and Litter Monitoring …
(2) training of volunteers, (3) in situ supervision by professional participation, and (4) 
validation of data and samples (modified from Bonney et al. 2009). Of the citizen-sci-ence studies on marine litter examined, 55 % included at least one of these steps (e.g. Rosevelt et al. 2013; Anderson and Alford 2014; Gago et al. 2014).
16.4.1  Preparation of Easy and Straight-Forward Protocols
The studies that took measures to guarantee data quality, provided standardized protocols, guidelines and datasheets (e.g. Ribic 1998; Gago et al. 2014). In order to create clear protocols, some studies needed to adjust the sampling target to be eas-ily identified by citizen scientists. For instance, Ribic et al. (2010) found that citi-zen scientists occasionally missed small pieces of debris (no specific size range was mentioned) in a monitoring program for beach litter. As a consequence of that obser -
vation, Hidalgo-Ruz and Thiel (2013) in a study focusing exclusively on small-plas-tic debris, decided to sample only items larger than 1 mm, which can be identified by the naked eye after sieving of sand. Once the sampling target is determined, the marine litter items likely to be found by citizen scientists can be photographed and included in preparatory materials. Photographs of marine litter items were used in 15 % of the studies (e.g. Moore et al. 2009; Anderson and Alford 2014).
16.4.2  Training of Volunteers
Data quality can also be improved by volunteer training (e.g. Storrier and McGlashan 2006; Smith et al. 2014). Indeed, 38 % of the citizen science stud-
ies examined here included a degree of training or preparation of the volunteers. Training could consist of a one-hour classroom preparation (e.g. Smith et al. 2014) 
or a brief introduction in the field just before the sampling activity (e.g. Moore et al. 2009). For instance, a study on ghost fishing by derelict crab traps (Anderson and Alford 2014) was preceded by a training period. Furthermore, during one 
study year, participants were asked to take photos of every trap and to identify the organisms in the traps. These photos were later examined by professional scien-tists who confirmed that the data recorded for each trap were accurate.
16.4.3  In Situ Supervision by Professionals
Scientists and survey monitors participated in the sampling activity in 43 % of the examined citizen-science studies. These professionals were in charge of assuring accuracy of debris classification, data recording and identification of missed/over -
looked debris items (e.g. Ribic et al. 2011, 2012a). For example, in a study from 
South Korea on the impacts of marine debris on wildlife, experts from wildlife, 438 V . Hidalgo-Ruz and M. Thiel
nature and marine research institutes provided data quality assurance on a volun-
tary basis contributing pictures of dissections or autoradiography in order to dem-onstrate how animals were affected by the debris (Hong et al. 2013).
16.4.4  Validation of Data and Samples
Citizen-science studies can also incorporate a validation process in which the data gathered by volunteers are compared to data obtained by professional scientists. This comparative approach was applied by 18 % of the studies, which evaluated the quality of the citizen-science data by re-counting the litter items, also using a microscope to differentiate between biological and synthetic litter (Rosevelt et al. 2013). For instance, Hidalgo-Ruz and Thiel (2013) recounted small plastic par -
ticles in samples that had been counted by citizen scientists. In one case, it was found that glass shards had been misidentified as small plastic debris. Elimination of samples with this kind of obvious error from the analysis can substantially improve data quality. According to Lindborg et al. (2012), citizen scientists can dissect and analyze seabird boluses with high accuracy resulting in measure-ments of contamination rates similar to those obtained by professional scientists. Validation can also be done by scientists analyzing photographs of samples taken by volunteers (Moore et al. 2009). Technological equipment can be used to gen-erate complementary data. For instance, Seino et al. (2009) used high-frequency ocean radar, airplanes and balloons to take photographs of marine litter, which were used to complement data collected by volunteers. Data quality control can also entail the elimination of erroneous data. For instance, in a user survey on beach littering, Eastman et al. (2013) explicitly reported the data that were dis-missed for further analyses. These data were related to mistaken, non-sensical and incomplete surveys, such as when children were too young to accurately complete the survey, or data were from locations with characteristics that differed from the main surveyed area (Eastman et al. 2013).
A remaining 45 % of citizen-science studies had no data quality control. In 
certain studies, no specific validation step might be necessary because volunteers only gathered qualitative data during beach cleanup activities (n = 11) or citizens only participated in opportunistic sighting and sample collection of dead animals, bird boluses, pellets and drifter buoys found on beaches (n = 5). No data quality control was explicitly mentioned in the professional studies examined herein.
16.5  Recommendations for Citizen-Science Projects  
on Marine Litter
In order to carefully plan a citizen-science study, certain models for develop-
ing studies should be followed (Bonney et al. 2009). The research question should be easy to understand by participants and should incorporate strategies 439
16 Citizen Scientists and Litter Monitoring …
to motivate volunteers (Eastman et al. 2014). High levels of personal motiva-
tion, training procedures, and encouraging volunteers to describe any uncertain-ties to researchers resulted in improved accuracy achieved by citizen scientists (Lindborg et al. 2012). The time commitment of the participation of individu-als and organizations should be respected. Accordingly, project leaders should concede ample time for the recruitment and training of volunteers. Sampling methods and data collection should be easy to manage with simple tools (e.g. transects, quadrats). Technology, such as smartphone applications and geo-ref-erenced photos can be a novel tool to explore (e.g. Martin 2013). It is strongly recommended that a professional scientist demonstrates the tasks that citizen scientists will be performing in the field beforehand. Whenever possible, sci-entific surveys themselves should be supervised by scientists in order to ensure proper sampling and data collection. Participants should also be involved in the data evaluation and communication of results as a concluding activity, because this will enhance their commitment to the activity. Considering these recom-mendations, citizen scientists are capable to collect relevant data, even show-ing no significant difference with results gathered by experienced scientists (Thiel et al. 2014).
16.6  Outlook and Conclusions
The vast distribution of marine litter throughout the world requires extensive sam-pling efforts of research teams, and the available information is still limited to certain topics of research and regions of the world. In this respect, citizen-science projects have made important contributions to marine litter science. Collaborations with citizen scientists can be a useful approach to expand the understanding of marine litter in the world. Most studies have focused on the distribution and com-position of marine litter, and beach cleanups are activities with the most active participation from citizen scientists.
Citizen science studies can cover a wide range of scales, from local to interna-
tional range, single events to long-term multi-year projects. Through the use of cit-izen scientists, new research areas can be addressed in the future. Coastal marine litter may be monitored by citizen-science studies, which can also include other citizens related to the sea, such as local people, fishers, sport clubs and tourists. For instance, diver associations around the world can be trained to sample subtidal plastic debris, and new projects can be initiated with the help of sailing clubs, where long-distance travelers can survey floating marine debris by direct observa-tion at sea, to study the distribution, composition and degradation of marine lit-ter in the open ocean. Citizen scientists can help to determine local litter sources, thereby contributing to keeping coastal regions clean. Citizen-science projects  
can focus on interviewing mariners, coastal people and local governments, for the purpose of identifying ways to reduce marine litter deposition.440 V . Hidalgo-Ruz and M. Thiel
With proper coordination, citizen science can include several other topics, such 
as interaction with biota and toxic effects. Nevertheless, a main concern of marine 
citizen science is to assure the quality of the collected data. In general, studies should include several steps to ensure data quality, including clear protocols, train-ing of volunteers, participation of professional scientists, and revision of samples and data. If these considerations are taken into account, citizen scientists not only can help with investigating the problem of marine litter, but they can become key allies in solving the problem of marine litter.
Acknowledgments It seems ironic that most professional scientists studying marine litter have 
initially been trained in marine biology, microbiology, oceanography or related disciplines. By 
having redirected their research attention to the problem of marine litter, they have demonstrated that they are true citizens of the oceans! With their fascination for the sea, they join the thousands of enthusiastic citizens all over the world who have contributed to some of the research discussed herein. We thank all the schoolchildren and teachers who have participated in the citizen science program “Científicos de la Basura” and who continue to motivate us every day in this quest for a clean ocean. We are also grateful to two anonymous reviewers and to Annie Mejaes who did the final language check of the manuscript.
