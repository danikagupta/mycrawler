Abstract: Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are biodegradable and biocompatible biopolymers. These
biomaterials have grown in importance in the ﬁelds of tissue engineering and tissue reconstruction for
structural applications where tissue morphology is critical, such as bone, cartilage, blood vessels, and
skin, among others. Furthermore, they can be used to accelerate the regeneration in combination with
drugs, as drug delivery systems, thus reducing microbial infections. When cells are cultured under
stress conditions, a wide variety of microorganisms produce them as a store of intracellular energy in
the form of homo- and copolymers of [R]—hydroxyalkanoic acids, depending on the carbon source
used for microorganism growth. This paper gives an overview of PHAs, their biosynthetic pathways,
producing microorganisms, cultivation bioprocess, isolation, puriﬁcation and characterization to
obtain biomaterials with medical applications such as tissue engineering.
Keywords: polyhydroxyalkanoates; microbial fermentation; isolation; puriﬁcation; characterization
1. Introduction
The currently increasing interest in polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) research for various
applications [ 1] is due to their biodegradability [ 2,3], biocompatibility [ 4], bioresorbabil-
ity [5] and piezoelectricity [ 1]. Furthermore, their various chemical properties have made
them the topic of several scientiﬁc studies. As other biopolymers, they are environmen-
tally friendly alternatives to non-biodegradable synthetic materials that have a negative
impact on the environment [ 6]. PHAs are produced by a wide range of microorganisms
under stress conditions of fermentation media composition, with a high concentration
of carbon source, and the rest of the nutrients are present in limited quantities (nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium, magnesium or oxygen) [ 7,8]. Depending on the carbon source,
the microorganisms make intracellular energy reserves under stress conditions in the form
of homo- or copolymers of [R]-hydroxyalkanoic acids. PHAs have attracted interest as
biodegradable polymers due to their biological (microbial) origin and non-toxic nature
when compared to synthetic plastics, which can be highly toxic. The most-studied PHA is
polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) [ 9], and the most recently known is PHA, namely, polyhydrox-
yoctanoate (PHO) [ 10]. While PHB can be produced on an industrial scale, the production
ofmcl-PHA is still inferior to scl-PHA production due to the toxicity of the substrate. PHB
has been studied in biomedical applications due to its thermoplastic behavior, suitable
mechanical properties and versatile sintering methods [ 11]. Many studies have conﬁrmed
that mcl-PHA can be much more ﬂexible and resistant than scl-PHA. These properties make
it a good option for use in many ﬁelds, especially in the medical ﬁeld or in obtaining ﬁlms
and coatings. PHA can be effective as a raw material in producing tablets, nanoparticles
or drug scaffolds due to its pleasant physical properties and high biocompatibility [ 12].
PHA obtained under controlled conditions and with high purity can be used in tissue
engineering through therapeutic applications such as vascular grafts, nerve tissue, or as a

scaffold to promote cell growth by supplying nutrition [ 13,14]. This review considers the
leading medical representatives of PHAs in tissue regeneration engineering in recent years,
particularly focusing on the production, isolation and characterization of such biopolymers.
2. Structure and Properties of Polyhydroxyalkanoates
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (Figure 1) make up a class of very versatile compounds, in
which over 100 polymers have been shown to date, differing by the number of carbon atoms
in the main chain or the radical R, [ 15,16], according to the formula, as seen in Table 1 [ 17]:

The PHA structure is differentiated according to two criteria:
(a) The structure of the radicals attached to the carbon atoms with the R conﬁguration in
the skeleton of the polymer chain; these radicals represent the side chain of monomeric
hydroxy acids;
(b) The number and structure of the monomers in the polymer chain.
Depending on the number of C atoms in the hydroxy acid side chain (monomer),
bacterial PHAs can be divided into three groups [18], namely:
 PHA is made up of monomers with 3–5 carbon atoms and called PHA with short side
chains, scl-PHA (short-chain-length—PHA);
 PHA is composed of monomers with 6–14 C atoms and called PHA with medium side
chains, mcl-PHA (medium-chain-length—PHA);Materials 2022 ,15, 1410 3 of 29
 PHA is composed of mixed monomers, both with a short side chain (3–5 C atoms) and
a long one (6–14 C atoms), called scl-mcl -PHA and later discovered in the ﬁrst two
categories.
The physical properties of these polymers are strictly dependent on the structure of the
monomers of which they are composed [ 19]. Hence the conclusion that, by incorporating
monomers with different numbers of C atoms, biodegradable polymers with an extensive
range of properties and uses varying can be obtained [20–22].
Depending on the number and structure of the component monomers, PHAs can be
homopolymers, copolymers or terpolymers.
The prototype of this family of polyesters, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), was discovered
by Lemoigne in 1927 at the Pasteur Institute in Paris as a constituent of the bacterium Bacillus
megaterium and had similar properties to polypropylene and polyethylene, including
ﬂexibility and excellent strength. PHB is presented as a dextrorotatory helix with two
turns located at a distance of 5.95 Å. Interactions between carbonyl-methyl groups stabilize
the conformation of the helix. Thus, one of nature’s few exceptions does not rely on the
hydrogen bond [23].
PHB can have an average molecular weight of 0.1–3 MDa, although, for processing,
the molecular masses must be between 200 and 800 kDa [24,25].
PHAs are predominantly produced by many bacteria as an intracellular energy reserve
when cells are cultured under stress condition as a series of homo- and copolymers of
[R]--hydroxyalkanoyl acids, depending on the source of C used to grow microorganisms.
Depending on the molecular structure, PHAs can have different physico-chemical
properties, and thermal stability is essential in using the polymer in various applications
because PHA is sensitive to heat [ 26].Scl-PHA type and its copolymers are semi-crystalline
polymers with a high melting temperature, and mcl-PHA have lower melting temperature
and are highly elastomeric [27]. Scl-PHA has a higher melting temperature than mcl-PHA
due to a high degree of crystallization from the polymer matrix [ 28,29].Mcl-PHA polymers
are a better choice for medical applications due to their better thermo-mechanical properties,
with a melting temperature between 39 and 61C, and are even more ﬂexible and elastic
than scl-PHA [ 30]. The polymer P (3HB) and its copolymer P (3HB-co-3HV) with low HV
content are known to be more rigid and have a low impact resistance due to the relatively
high crystallinity of the material and the appearance of the second crystallinity that occurs
after the material’s aging process [31].
Poly (3-hydroxybutyrate- co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) degradation is faster than
PHB. The degradation kinetics of biopolymers depend on the processing conditions, and,
therefore, on the structure (copolymer or homopolymer) and crystallinity [ 32]. Com-
mercially available PHB and PHBV have different trade names: Biopol®(Monsanto, MI,
USA), Nodax®(Procter & Gamble, Cincinnati, OH, USA), PHBH®(Kaneka Corporation,
Tokyo, Japan), Eamat®(Tianan, Ningbo, China) and Biomer P®from Biomer (Bayern,
Germany) [33], as well as GalaFLEX®(Galatea-Tepha, Lexington, MA, USA) [34].
PHAs are biocompatible for various reasons, the most important of which is that PHAs
are found everywhere, not only in microorganisms as a carbon and energy storage material,
but also in plants and animals in the form of low-molecular-weight PHA [ 35]. The chemical
composition of PHA is also essential so that the degree of purity can affect the biocompati-
bility feature of the polymer [ 36]. Studies have shown that inﬂammatory reactions due to
the importance of the material purity were found in a scl-PHA copolymer, tested in vivo
on laboratory animals so that the impurities migrated into the surrounding tissue [ 37].
Another valuable property in biomedical applications of PHA is biodegradability. In the
natural environment, it is degraded by microbial depolymerization, and when implanted
in the body, in vivo , it can be degraded by enzymatic and hydrolysis mechanisms. Lipase
can be considered the main enzyme responsible for biodegrading PHA types ( scl- and mcl-)
in the body [38].Materials 2022 ,15, 1410 4 of 29
3. Production PHA
3.1. Biological Synthesis
PHAs biosynthesis comprises two enzymatic steps: monomer intake and the polymer-
ization of previously generated monomer units. To make PHA production more efﬁcient,
it is necessary to express the metabolic pathways regarding monomers integration into
biosynthesis processes. All the substrate monomers for polymerization are derived from
fatty acid metabolism in biosynthesis and elongation processes, except for acetyl-CoA
synthesis. In conclusion, monomer-targeting enzymes are described as being related to the
speciﬁc substrate.
The combination of genetic engineering techniques and fermentation technologies
led to high poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate production. The copolymerization of 3PHB with
larger chains of 3-hydroxyalkanoate provides the product’s superior physical properties,
ductility and strength compared to PHB homopolyester. As a result, understanding the
compositional diversity of the integrated monomers is critical. This may be adjusted
based on the metabolic routes used for monomer intake. A bacterium (such as Ralstonia
eutropha ), when supplemented with different precursors, can synthesize PHB and different
copolymers. By genetic engineering, it is possible to greatly control the produced polymer.
It has been shown that Escherichia coli strains, together with PHA-negative nutrients,
are used as hosts, and more than 100 examples of genetic engineering are described for
performance in this area. [18,39–41]
3.1.1. Metabolic Pathways for PHA Biosynthesis
In recent years, it has become apparent that different metabolic pathways can con-
tribute to screening PHA monomers. The metabolic pathways for PHA biosynthesis are
multiple and their biosynthesis by microorganisms is dependent on the carbon source in the
environment. “Related” carbon sources produce hydroxyalkanoate monomers with a simi-
lar chemical structure, while “unrelated” sources generate hydroxyalkanoate monomers
with a completely different structure. The metabolic pathways are speciﬁc for each mi-
croorganism, describing three metabolic pathways to which the enzymatic participation of
acetyl-CoA is common.
Metabolic pathway I is the most common and generates hydroxybutyrate monomers
with the participation of acetyl-CoA.
Metabolic pathway II generates PHA from fatty acids and can form various hydrox-
yalkanoate monomers for PHA biosynthesis. The use of fatty acids by bacteria requires the
coordination of -oxidizing enzymes and a fatty acid transport system. By the -oxidation
of fatty acids, a corresponding conversion with the genetic inheritance of the microorganism
must take place.
Some medium- and long-chain PHA fatty acid bacteria must form 3-hydroxy acyl-CoA
from glucose and other unrelated carbon sources. Therefore, the biosynthesis of PHA from
glucose in these bacteria is related to the biosynthesis of fatty acids (metabolic pathway III).
It has been shown that some Pseudomonas species grown on unrelated carbon sources
predominantly accumulate 3-hydroxydecanoate monomers and other minor constituents
such as 3-hydroxyhexanoate and 3-hydroxyoctanoate.
The similarity in the composition of PHA generated from different carbon sources
shows the presence of a common intermediary in the substrate’s metabolism, most likely
acetyl-CoA.
The manufacture of multiple distinct monomers for the biosynthesis of PHAs from
unrelated carbon sources and simple carbon sources is a signiﬁcant cost factor in PHA
production.
Pseudomonas sp. Are best known and used as producers of PHAs because they can
perform their biosynthesis from various carbon sources, including n-alkanes, n-alkenes,
alkanoic acids and alkenoic acids.Materials 2022 ,15, 1410 5 of 29
Intermediates in the biosynthesis of fatty acid PHAs must convert the acyl carrier
protein to the CoA form. Recently, it was found that the phaG gene was involved in this
conversion, and the existence of this enzyme was anticipated a long time ago.
The discovery of acyl-ACP-CoA transacylase connects fatty acid production to PHA
biosynthesis [42–44].
The metabolic pathways for the supply of various hydroxydecanoate monomers are
presented in Figure 2.

3.1.2. Microorganisms Producing PHA
Poly-3-hydroxyalkanoates are intracellularly reported as energy substances stored by
a wide range of bacteria. Obtaining them is conditioned by limiting the nitrogen source in
the fermentation medium, but the limitation of the carbon source and the phosphates was
also studied [46].
The bacterial productivity of polyhydroxyalkanoates is inﬂuenced by various parame-
ters, including the carbon source/nitrogen source ratio, cultivation duration, temperature,
pH, and the presence of macro- and microelements [47].
Many bacteria have the property of storing the energy and skeletons of carbon atoms
as biodegradable compounds with polymeric structures and properties similar to synthetic
plastics. However, very few can produce or accumulate these polymers in industrially
valuable quantities [ 48,49]. Among the microorganisms capable of producing PHAs, the
most-studied were Pseudomonas oleovorans [46,50],Pseudomonas aeruginosa [51] and Pseu-
domonas putida [39],Ralstonia eutropha , as well as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii transformed
with two expression vectors, including one from Ralstonia eutropha [50]. Genes for about 30
PHA synthases and, therefore, for several PHA biosynthesis pathways have been cloned,
and many of them have been analyzed [46,52–54].Materials 2022 ,15, 1410 6 of 29
Various fermentation methodologies, including batch, fed-batch, and continuous
processes, were used to achieve a high-biomass PHA production. Finding the best-suited
carbon source might help to increase polymer output. Table 2 summarizes the bacterial
strains that were employed to manufacture PHA, their initial carbon sources, and the
(co)-polymers that were produced.

Cupriavidus necator (also known as Ralstonia eutropha orAlcaligenes eutrophus) [74,75]
is the strain that has received the most attention for its ability to produce PHAs. Imperial
Chemical Industries (ICI plc) was the ﬁrst to employ this bacterial strain to manufacture
PHBV copolymer under the brand name Biopol. Bacillus spp., Alcaligenes spp., Pseudomonas
spp., Escherichia coli , and Halomonas boliviensis are some other notable bacterial species that
have recently been researched. [39,63].
During the production of biopolymers, the production of spores is also favored, to
the detriment of the production of biopolymers, because of environmental conditions.
Genetic engineering is a powerful tool in optimizing microbial metabolism to polymer
production. Therefore, mutants that do not form Bacillus spores have been studied to
increase their potential to produce PHA. In addition, Escherichia coli strains [ 76] were
genetically engineered to manufacture PHB with an M wof up to 107Da from glucose.
This ultra-high-molecular-weight PHB (UHMW-PHB) can be formed into extremely strong
ﬁlms [77].
3.1.3. Cultivation and Product Biosynthesis Media
Usable substrates for PHA generation can be classiﬁed into three types based on the
role they can perform throughout the fermentation process [41]:
 Substrates that support both cell growth and Poly (3HA) production;
 Substrates that support cell growth but not the production of Poly (3HA);
 Substrates that do not support cell growth but support the production of Poly (3HA).
Sugars, alkanes, fatty acids, and carbohydrates are the most commonly used carbon
sources in the production of PHA. [ 78]. Wastes that are renewable carbon sources, such
as acetate, frying or cooking oil, crude glycerol, molasses, and wastewater, could also be
carbon sources [79].
The required conditions (carbon source, nutrients) for the accumulation of PHA differ
depending on the bacteria and the carbon source. In a culture with limited nutrients and
abundant carbon sources, some bacteria accumulate PHA ( Cupriavidus necator, Protomonas
extorquens ). However, some accumulate PHA during the growth period without restricting
an important nutrient (recombinant Escherichia coli, Alcaligenes latus ) [80–82].
The carbon source used determines the type of PHA that is produced due to the
substrate speciﬁcity of the enzymes involved in the metabolic pathway of biopolymers [ 79]
The most common type of PHA produced by microorganisms is poly-3-hydroxybutyrate,
a short-chain homopolymer also called poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid, P (3HB) or PHB.
Some heterotrophic microorganisms produce it in a well-defined culture media and batch or
fed-batch cultures.
Ralstonia eutropha DSM 428 (H16) is the microorganism chosen by the Imperial Chemical
Industries-Agricultural Division (ICI) for the commercial production of polyhydroxybutyrate-
co-polyhydroxy valerate: PHB/HV , PHBV , P (3HB-3HV) from glucose and propionic acid
under nitrogen-limiting conditions. This copolymer has improved qualities compared
to PHB.
When the carbon source is glucose, Alcaligenes eutrophus NCIB 11599 produces an
amount of 5.08 g/L PHA, with a PHA content of 54% compared to dry biomass [ 83].
Alcaligenes eutrophus ATCC 33500 also produces an amount of 4.16 g/L PHA on glucose,
with a PHA content of 60% compared to dry biomass.
Generally, Ralstonia eutropha does not use glucose, but Ralstonia eutropha DSM 545 can
use glucose as a mutant of Ralstonia eutropha DSM 529. When the carbon source is glucose
(1%), under the conditions of its supplementation with black grain bean broth containing
carbohydrates, proteins, ﬁber, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, zinc, copper; aeration
of the culture by shaking the ﬂasks at 160 rpm for 48–52 h and culture growth at 30C,
theRalstonia eutropha (Cupriavidus necator ) DSM 545 bacterium produces, at the end of
cultivation, a PHB concentration of 0.23 g/L, (representing 34% of the cell dry weight)
up to 2.06 g/L (representing 76% of the cell dry weight). The authors noted that PHBMaterials 2022 ,15, 1410 8 of 29
biosynthesis occurs simultaneously with biomass accumulation. However, even though
the yield of PHB from dry biomass is 76%, cell and PHA concentrations remain low [ 83,84].
Regarding the culture medium for Ralstonia eutropha DSM 545, the DSM/Catalogue
1998 [Catalogue of strains DSMZ, 6th edition, Ralstonia eutropha (Alcaligenes eutrophus )
DSM 545. Medium 1 or 81: Pg. 138, (Medium 1: P . 307), (Medium 81: P . 311)] described
the following media for this microorganism: medium 1 (nutrient agar, usable for culture
maintenance) and medium 81, usable for growth: chemolithotrophic (in the atmosphere
of 2% O 2, 10% CO 2, 60% H 2and 28% N 2,v/v); heterotrophic (in the presence of minerals
and a 0.2% carbohydrate or a 0.1% organic acid); or on a nitrogen-free medium, in an
atmosphere of 2% O 2, 10% CO 2, 10% H 2and 78% N 2(v/v), or in an atmosphere of 2%
O2and 98% N 2(v/v). The growth of the microorganism on these media takes place at a
temperature of 30C.
For the cultivation of the bacterium Alcaligenes latus DSM 1123, in 1988, Lafferty [ 85,86]
described the following culture medium: sucrose 1.5 g%; (NH 4)2SO40.15 g%; Na 2HPO 42H2O
0.45 g%; KH 2PO40.15 g%; MgSO 47H2O 0.02%; CaCl 22H2O 0.002%; Fe III NH 4citrate
0.005 g%; pH 7. The microelement solution had the following composition: ZnSO 47H2O
100 mg/L; MnCl 24H2O 30 mg/L; H 3BO3300 mg/L; CoCl 26H2O 200 mg/L; CuSO 45H2O
10 mg/L; NiCl 26H2O 20 mg/L; NaMoO 42H2O 30 mg/L; water 1 L. In a continuous
cultivation of three weeks carried out at 37C, and maintaining pH 7 throughout the
cultivation, with this microorganism ( Alcaligenes latus DSM 1123) and on this carbon source
(sucrose 1.5 g%) a content of 71% . . . 79% PHB compared to dry biomass was obtained.
Other precursors of the 3HV monomer include aliphatic fatty acids with a longer
carbon chain length and an odd number of carbon atoms, such as valeric acid, heptanoic
acid, and nonanoic acid, since the -oxidation cycle produces propionyl-CoA rather than
acetyl-CoA [ 80]. Thus, the probability of obtaining polymer with a 3HV fraction is higher
when fatty acids are present as a carbon source in the culture medium [86].
In the case of mcl-PHA production, octanoic acid was used as the ﬁrst carbon source,
using Pseudomonas oleovorans as a microorganism [ 87]. As for scl-PHA, the type of substrate
used for cell growth inﬂuences the biosynthesis path of mcl-PHA-producing bacteria. Thus,
biopolymer production is closely related to the metabolic pathways of fatty acids [59,88].
According to studies on the PHA product, the biopolymer yield and its physical and
mechanical properties can be altered based on the carbon source and the composition
of fermentation medium [ 89–91], inﬂuencing the scope of the resultant polymer [ 92]. In
the cultivation of Pseudomonas oleovorans , for example, combinations of 5-phenylvaleric
acid and n-alkanoic acids inﬂuenced the biopolymer composition and the yield of the
bioprocess. Thus, the polymer content in 3-hydroxy-5-phenyl valerate increased for a
higher addition of 5-phenylvaleric acid in the fermentation medium [ 93]. In another study,
mcl-PHA with adapted oleﬁnic monomer content was produced by P . putida GPo1 strain
using different concentrations of octanoate and 10-undecenoate as a carbon source [ 92]. For
Pseudomonas putida KT2442 growing in media with varying concentrations of octanoate
and 6 (4-cyanophenoxy) hexanoate, mcl-PHA, composed of 3HO, 3HH Xand 3-hydroxy-6
(4-cyanophenoxy) hexanoate, was produced [94].
3.1.4. Fermentation Bioprocess
For PHA biosynthesis, several microorganisms were studied using different operation
modes of fermentation, namely: batch, fed-batch and continuous processes [ 48]. Batch
fermentation is commonly employed in commercial fermentation processes due to its low
overhead production costs. The cultivation approach is based on the addition of a carbon
source to the culture medium at the start of the bioprocess and the accumulation of a
biopolymer. Batch fermentation can be accomplished in two ways: one-stage cultivation
and two-stage cultivation [ 95]. Cell development, synthesis, and biopolymer accumulation
all occur at the same time in a single stage. The two-stage process contains two phases:
microbial growth and biopolymer accumulation [ 96]. The culture is performed in the ﬁrst
stage to achieve a sufﬁcient concentration of bacterial cells. In contrast, the bacterial growthMaterials 2022 ,15, 1410 9 of 29
rate remains constant in the second stage, the nutritional constraint stage, but the cells
begin to deposit intracellular PHAs [ 97]. The batch fermentation procedure may also be
associated with a low yield of polyhydroxyalkanoates due to PHA degradation after full
utilization of the substrate, resulting in a low amount of the end product [98].
Batch fermentation was used to investigate mcl-PHA homopolymers synthesized by
Pseudomonas species [ 99]. A strain of Pseudomonas mendocina , using sodium octanoate as
a carbon source, produced biopolymers with a content of 31.38% of 3-hydroxyoctanoate
[P (3HO)].
In batch culture operation, a mixture of carbon sources such as citrate/octanoate [ 48]
or glucose/octanoic acid [ 97] can be used simultaneously to achieve cell growth and
the production of mcl-Poly (3HA), the fatty acid acting as a structural precursor for the
synthesis of mcl-Poly (3HA), and the structurally uncorrelated carbon source used to
provide the energy support of bacterial cells. In this context, to produce mcl-PHA in batch
mode, three strains of Pseudomonas , namely Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens ICCF 392, Pseudomonas
putida ICCF 391 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ICCF 90, were also studied, using citric acid
(glucose or glycerol) 2 g% and/or octanoate or decanoate 0.25–0.5 g%, as carbon sources
in a fermentation medium with mineral salts (medium E), with an initial pH of 7–7.2 in
a bioprocess of 48 h at 30C, on a rotary shaker [ 65]. It was found that each strain has
a speciﬁc behavior towards the carbon source. Thus, the strain Pseudomonas putida ICCF
391 produced 1347g mcl-PHA/L, when grown on medium E with glucose and octanoate,
compared to Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens ICCF 392, which produced a maximum of 1167 mcl-
PHA /L and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ICCF 90 (ATCC 9027), which produced a maximum
ﬁnal concentration of 0.83 mcl-PHA/L. Tested on different media, they produced PHAs
with C6:C8:C10:C11:C14 in different proportions; C4 and C5 monomers were not identiﬁed.
The highest total content of 99.7% PHA, composed of 79% PHO and 6% PHD, was produced
byP . ﬂuorescens (Figure 3).

 3.1.4. Fermentation  Bioprocess  
For PHA biosynthesis,  several microorganisms  were studied using different  opera‐
tion modes of fermentation,  namely: batch, fed‐batch and continuous  processes  [48]. Batch 
fermentation  is commonly  employed  in commercial  fermentation  processes  due to its low 
overhead  production  costs. The cultivation  approach  is based on the addition of a carbon 
source to the culture medium at the start of the bioprocess  and the accumulation  of a bi‐
opolymer.  Batch fermentation  can be accomplished  in two ways: one‐stage cultivation  and 
two‐stage cultivation  [95]. Cell development,  synthesis,  and biopolymer  accumulation  all 
occur at the same time in a single stage. The two‐stage process contains two phases: mi‐
crobial growth and biopolymer  accumulation  [96]. The culture is performed  in the first 
stage to achieve a sufficient  concentration  of bacterial  cells. In contrast,  the bacterial  
growth rate remains constant in the second stage, the nutritional  constraint  stage, but the 
cells begin to deposit intracellular  PHAs [97]. The batch fermentation  procedure  may also 
be associated  with a low yield of polyhydroxyalkanoates  due to PHA degradation  after 
full utilization  of the substrate,  resulting  in a low amount of the end product [98]. 
Batch fermentation  was used to investigate  mcl‐PHA homopolymers  synthesized  by 
Pseudomonas  species [99]. A strain of Pseudomonas  mendocina , using sodium octanoate  as a 
carbon source, produced  biopolymers  with a content of 31.38% of 3‐hydroxyoctanoate  [P 
(3HO)]. 
In batch culture operation,  a mixture of carbon sources such as citrate/octanoate  [48] 
or glucose/octanoic  acid [97] can be used simultaneously  to achieve cell growth and the 
production  of mcl‐Poly (3HA), the fatty acid acting as a structural  precursor  for the syn‐
thesis of mcl‐Poly (3HA), and the structurally  uncorrelated  carbon source used to provide 
the energy support of bacterial  cells. In this context, to produce mcl‐PHA in batch mode, 
three strains of Pseudomonas , namely Pseudomonas  fluorescens  ICCF 392, Pseudomonas  putida 
ICCF 391 and Pseudomonas  aeruginosa  ICCF 90, were also studied, using citric acid (glucose 
or glycerol)  2 g% and/or octanoate  or decanoate  0.25–0.5 g%, as carbon sources in a fer‐
mentation  medium with mineral salts (medium  E), with an initial pH of 7–7.2 in a biopro‐
cess of 48 h at 30oC, on a rotary shaker [65]. It was found that each strain has a specific 
behavior  towards the carbon source. Thus, the strain Pseudomonas  putida ICCF 391 pro‐
duced 1347g mcl‐PHA/L, when grown on medium E with glucose and octanoate,  com‐
pared to Pseudomonas  fluorescens  ICCF 392, which produced  a maximum  of 1167 mcl‐PHA 
/L and Pseudomonas  aeruginosa  ICCF 90 (ATCC 9027), which produced  a maximum  final 
concentration  of 0.83 mcl‐PHA/L. Tested on different  media, they produced  PHAs with 
C6:C8:C10:C11:C14  in different  proportions;  C4 and C5 monomers  were not identified.  
The highest total content of 99.7% PHA, composed  of 79% PHO and 6% PHD, was pro‐
duced by P. fluorescens  (Figure 3).

For PHA production, the use of mixed cultures was introduced, improving fermenta-
tion efﬁciency [ 100]. The use of mixed open crops, such as activated sludge [ 101–103], can
contribute to lowering the cost of PHAs, therefore increasing their market potential [104].
For the accumulation of poly-3-hydroxyoctanoate (PHO) [ 68], batch fermentation
production was studied using a consortium of bacterial strains Pseudomonas putida and
Bacillus subtilis /Bacillus subtilis BSV in a ratio of 3:1, compared to PHO biosynthesis with
P . putida (Table 3, Figure 4).Materials 2022 ,15, 1410 10 of 29

ymers (%): 85.83–86.8  C8, 5.38–5.55  C6, and 5.65–6.45  C10 were obtained.  
To obtain PHB with a strain of Alcaligenes  latus, Grothe et al. [105] studied the process 
in fed‐batch culture, with the bioprocess  having the following  characteristics:  growth rate 
of 0.075/h, sucrose consumption  rate of 0.38 g/L*h, with a maximum  PHB rate of 0.15 
g/L*h. At the end of fermentation  (93 h), under optimized  conditions,  the production  yield 
of PHB was 60% of the dry cell mass. 
In fed‐batch cultivation,  the fermentation  process is more efficient than in the batch 
operation,  because it reaches a high density of bacterial  cells and the highest possible con‐

The results revealed the consortium performance regarding the production of biopoly-
mers (%): 85.83–86.8 C8, 5.38–5.55 C6, and 5.65–6.45 C10 were obtained.
To obtain PHB with a strain of Alcaligenes latus, Grothe et al. [ 105] studied the process
in fed-batch culture, with the bioprocess having the following characteristics: growth rate of
0.075/h, sucrose consumption rate of 0.38 g/L*h, with a maximum PHB rate of 0.15 g/L*h .
At the end of fermentation (93 h), under optimized conditions, the production yield of PHB
was 60% of the dry cell mass.
In fed-batch cultivation, the fermentation process is more efﬁcient than in the batch
operation, because it reaches a high density of bacterial cells and the highest possible
concentration of bioproduct [ 106,107]. During fermentation, the growth medium is sup-
plemented with a portion of the substrate. This technique ensures consistent nutritional
management, avoids carbon source restrictions, and allows for efﬁcient microorganism
growth and biopolymer buildup [ 107]. This culture method is ideal for the industrial pro-
duction of PHA. In fed-batch culture, the strain Pseudomonas putida KT2440 can accumulate
more mcl-PHA when co-substrates such as acrylic acid, nonanoic acid, and glucose are
used. The authors showed that this fermentation synthesized 75.5% PHA with 89 mol%
3-hydroxynonanoate (HN) at a feed mass ratio of nonanoic acid: glucose: acrylic acid of
1.25:1:0.05, and a speciﬁc growth rate of 0.15 h 1[108].
In a study performed on P . putida strain KT2440 designed to synthesize mcl-PHA, with
acetate as the only carbon source, 674 mg/L of mcl-PHA was produced in fed-batch culture,
which was 92% higher than with the parent strain [109].
El-Sayed Azhar et al. [ 110] performed comparative studies on PHB production by Ral-
stonia eutropha strain ATCC 17697 and Alcaligenes latus ATCC 29712 grown on a productive
medium as fed-batch. The data show that the weight of dry cell mass and sugar consumed
increased during fermentation, resulting in a gradual increase in PHB concentration. TheMaterials 2022 ,15, 1410 11 of 29
concentration and content of PHB obtained with sugar (glucose, sucrose) as carbon source
by R. eutropha ATCC 17697 and A. latus ATCC 29712 were 10.53 g/L and 64.52% and
8.84 g/L and 58, respectively, 12%. Conversion coefﬁcient, yield (%), PHB biosynthesis
rate and productivity were for R. eutropha ATCC 17697 61.90%, 52.65%, 0.051 g/g*h and
0.29 g/L*h, and 46.81%, 41.40%, 0.050 g/g*h and 0.32 g/L*h, for A. latus ATCC 29712,
respectively.
Continuous culture is acknowledged as a practice that boosts productivity while also
providing excellent consistency and uniformity of product quality, as well as the long-term
genetic stability of the strain [ 111]. As soon as equilibrium conditions are reached, the active
biomass concentration, PHA content, and substrates are constant. Under these conditions,
cell harvesting is also ongoing [ 112]. The major disadvantage of this procedure is the risk
of microbial infection, which might compromise entire batches of fermentation and result
in large economic losses [113].
Pseudomonas putida GPo1 was used to perform the ﬁrst continuous mcl-PHA biosynthe-
sis [46]. The scientists conﬁrmed that continuous culture was a viable method for providing
bacterial cells with a sufﬁcient substrate while preventing substrate concentrations in the
culture medium from being inhibited. The percentage of PHA in the biomass remained
constant at a dilution rate of 0.24/h and an increasing carbon/nitrogen ratio (13% of CDW).
When the speciﬁc growth rate was shorter than 0.3/h, the isolated PHAs had a steady
proportion of monomer composition with a 3HB/3HHx/3HO/3HD ratio of 0.1:1.7:20.7:1.0.
By the strain Pseudomonas oleovorans ATCC 29347, grown on octane gas, mcl-PHA was
produced in a continuous two-stage system. The speciﬁc growth rate of the microorganism
in the ﬁrst compartment was reached by connecting two bio-fermenters in series, resulting
in PHA synthesis at higher rates in the second compartment. Pseudomonas oleovorans cells
produced 63% PHA of CDW in the second fermenter, which was efﬂuent under these
conditions. The two-stage bioprocess is more efﬁcient than a single-stage arrangement due
to cell proliferation and mcl-PHA accumulation [114].
4. Isolation and Puriﬁcation
The recovery of PHA from bacterial cells is a critical step in the successful manufacture
of these polymers. This process entails extracting the polymer from the cells and purifying it
after it has been recovered from the culture broth at the end of the manufacturing phase. The
extraction methods are shown in Table 4. In the commercialization of PHA-based products,
the cost of the process, as well as the purity of the recovered PHA, is critical [ 115]. PHA
is generated intracellularly as carbon and energy storage macromolecules; therefore, its
recovery requires cell lysis, which releases PHA granules, followed by solvent solubilization
and PHA extraction from cell debris [ 116]. Selecting an appropriate extraction procedure is
critical to the long-term sustainability of these plastic biopolymers [117,118].
PHA can be extracted from microbial biomass by solvent extraction or chemical
digestion of non-PHA cell mass (NPCM). Both procedures capture bacterial cells by ﬁltering
the culture broth or centrifuging the supernatant, which no longer contains cells. The PHA
polymer is extracted from the biomass that remains in the pellet [ 119]. Mixed procedures
are also used, for example, the isolation of PHA occurring after chemical or enzymatic
digestion of biomass, or after a chemical technique. The disintegration, deslipidization, and
anhydrization of PHA are followed by both procedures. The insoluble substance is then
extracted as PHA using a solvent such as chloroform or acetone [ 66]. In Figure 5, a possible
post-biosynthesis processing ﬂow of a PHA polymer, using solvent extraction, is presented.Materials 2022 ,15, 1410 12 of 29

4.1. Solvent Extraction  
Solvent extraction  is the PHA extracting  process from biomass by dissolving  it in an 
organic solvent (see Table 4). Chloroform,  methyl ether, methylene  chloride,  or non‐chlo‐
rinated solvents can all be used [120,121].  PHAs are recovered  from dry biomass using an 
organic solvent and/or heating, as well as Soxhlet extraction.  Soxhlet extraction  is a simple 
and efficient technique  in which PHA‐containing  biomass is exposed to a solvent such as 
chloroform  or acetone [66,71], which changes the cell membrane  and allows for the release 
of PHA granules  and polymer solubilization  [122]. To eliminate  cellular debris, the solu‐
tion is filtered or centrifuged.  The solvent is then evaporated,  leaving an impure biopoly‐
mer with cellular components  that are soluble in the organic solvent [66].

4.1. Solvent Extraction
Solvent extraction is the PHA extracting process from biomass by dissolving it in
an organic solvent (see Table 4). Chloroform, methyl ether, methylene chloride, or non-
chlorinated solvents can all be used [ 120,121]. PHAs are recovered from dry biomass using
an organic solvent and/or heating, as well as Soxhlet extraction. Soxhlet extraction is a
simple and efﬁcient technique in which PHA-containing biomass is exposed to a solvent
such as chloroform or acetone [ 66,71], which changes the cell membrane and allows for
the release of PHA granules and polymer solubilization [ 122]. To eliminate cellular debris,
the solution is ﬁltered or centrifuged. The solvent is then evaporated, leaving an impure
biopolymer with cellular components that are soluble in the organic solvent [66].
4.2. Digestion of Non-PHA Cell Mass (NPCM)
Physical treatments, such as mechanical disintegration in ball mills, heat or ultrasound
treatment, or chemical treatments such as surfactants, alkalis or acids, and enzymatic
treatments, are used in NPCM digestion [ 117]. Following the chosen treatment, the PHA
granules are separated from the cellular components using ﬁltration or centrifugation.
To reach as high a biomaterial purity as possible, the steps must be repeated numerous
times [ 123]. As it does not utilize chemicals, the treatment process for bead mills is envi-
ronmentally friendly. It has an expandable capacity, but it takes a long time to process and
usually requires several steps [ 124]. To optimize PHA extraction and purity yield, this canMaterials 2022 ,15, 1410 13 of 29
be combined with other chemical or enzymatic treatments. This approach, for example,
extracts P (3HB) from Alcaligenes latus [125].
Chemical digestion with sodium hypochlorite (see Table 4), which solubilizes all
cellular debris while leaving the biopolymer granules intact, is a well-known technique for
PHB extraction in microbial cultures [ 126]. PHB from Cupriavidus necator , for example, was
extracted using this approach and biomass was recovered at a rate of over 90% with a purity
of up to 98% [ 127]. This process, however, has a number of disadvantages, including the
use of sodium hypochlorite, which lowers the molecular weight of the ﬁnal biopolymer and
leaves residues that are difﬁcult to remove from the PHA [ 128]. In the preparation of mcl-
PHA, enzymatic approaches are expensive technologies with complex processes [ 120]. A
combination of enzymes containing alkalase, SDS, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA),
and lysozyme were employed to digest P . putida NPCM for mcl-PHA extraction (see
Table 4). This technique yielded a 90% polymer recovery rate and a 92.6% purity rate [ 129].
The advantage of this method is that it has been demonstrated to be an environmentally
friendly extraction procedure with a negative impact on the biopolymer’s ﬁnal molecular
weight, but the method is costly due to the huge number of steps required to obtain as pure
a polymer as possible [126].

4.3. Puriﬁcation of PHA
PHA in medical and pharmaceutical applications should have high purity, especially
for tissue engineering, with no contaminants such as surfactants or endotoxins [ 135].
Biologically active contaminants, such as proteins and lipopolysaccharides, must also be
eliminated since they can trigger immunological reactions. Lipopolysaccharides, whichMaterials 2022 ,15, 1410 14 of 29
are found in bacteria’s membrane and are released after cell lysis, can contaminate the
polymer and act as endotoxins [ 125]. When the polymer comes into contact with blood, it
can cause negative responses [ 119]. Dissolution, precipitation, and washing with methanol
or ethanol are the most common methods for purifying PHA. However, their use raises the
overall cost of puriﬁcation, implying an increase in the cost of producing PHA on a large
scale [136].
Another method of puriﬁcation is hydrogen peroxide treatment in conjunction with
the action of enzymes or chelating agents. This begins by processing the cell suspension con-
taining PHA, which is heat-treated, followed by enzymatic hydrolysis, sulfate treatments,
and the ﬁnal discoloration with hydrogen peroxides. All these steps lead to high costs,
even though the use of enzymes leads to good recovery results [ 137]. Following studies of
enzymatic hydrolysis, the best results (88.8% P3HB purity) were obtained with 2% brome-
lain (enzyme mass per biomass) at 50C and pH 9.0. Good results (90% purity) were also
obtained with a pancreatin that is three times cheaper than bromelain [ 134]. On Burkholderia
sp. PT19, a combination approach incorporating enzymes and sodium hypochlorite was
used [ 138]. Using papain, a purity of 89% was obtained. Yasotha et al. [ 139] investigated
another combined method involving the use of alkalis, SDS, and EDTA, succeeding in
the culture of P.putida to obtain by extraction 71.55% PHA, which was recovered in a
water suspension by removing solubilized non-PHA cell material by ultraﬁltration and
puriﬁcation in a continuous diaﬁltration process. Finally, a PHA with a purity of 92.6% was
produced [139].
In 2001, Horowitz and Brennan proposed the use of ozone to purify PHA, where ozone
was applied to biomass in an oxygen stream containing between 2 and 5% ozone. Ozone
treatment facilitates the removal of impurities by solubilizing, bleaching and deodorizing
aqueous polymer suspensions. This method is advantageous compared to the treatment of
PHA with hydrogen peroxide, and disadvantageous due to its high temperature, peroxide
instability in the presence of a high cell biomass and decreased molecular weight of the
polymer [140].
5. Characterization, Methods and Results
Puriﬁed PHA polymers have different chemical compositions and properties due to
various monomer units and the different insertions of these monomers in other polymer
chains. Therefore, to identify a suitable application of a PHA polymer, it is necessary to
characterize the biomaterial through different speciﬁc techniques, as seen in Table 5.

5.1. Monomeric Composition and Molecular Distribution
Many analytical methods for PHA detection can provide quantitative information
about PHAs. For example, the monomeric composition and distribution of PHA can be
determined by various methods, such as high-performance liquid chromatography [ 144],
gas chromatography [ 154] or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [ 155]. How-
ever, the ability to provide qualitative information about monomeric constituents is limited
to LC. Solvent extraction is a time-consuming step in the sample preparation process for
GC analysis. In contrast to GC–MS, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS)
allows for the measurement of known PHA monomers upon hydrolysis without the need
for solvent extraction [ 156]. However, NMR and GC methods can provide qualitative
and quantitative information on PHA. Therefore, GC-based methods are most often used
against NMR due to the ease of sample preparation and lower costs [ 142]. GC coupled with
ﬂame ionization detector (GC-FID) is one of the most commonly used methods to identify
and quantify PHAs. However, GC-FID largely depends on the inclusion of appropriate
PHA analytical standards [ 157]. Due to the lack of chemicals in sample preparation, and
the precision and accuracy with which PHA structures are detected, matrix-assisted laser
desorption ionization time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) is far superior
to other approaches to identifying monomeric composition. In addition, this method can
also be used in the molecular weight assessment and molecular weight distribution of
PHA [158].
With good sensitivity, linearity, accuracy, and reproducibility, the suggested innova-
tive LC–MS approach permitted the simultaneous measurement of seven PHA monomer
standards utilizing IAA (Indole-3-acetic acid) as an internal standard in a single chro-
matographic run. With MS-guided fractionation, the LC technique was also able to ef-
fectively isolate unknown PHA monomers. If the isolated unknown PHA monomers
are pure enough, then NMR spectroscopy can reveal their structure. The combination
of LC and NMR enabled the structural characterization of a wide range of unusual PHA
monomers [ 143]. The monomeric composition of PHAs was determined using an im-
proved LC–MS method. PHAs were extracted from Pseudomonas cultures on various carbon
sources and utilized as actual samples to demonstrate the analysis and detection of PHA
monomers, as shown in Figure 6A–C. According to Figure 6B,C, the PHAs were made
up of three unknown PHA monomers called Unk1, Unk2, and Unk3, in addition to C6,
C8, C10, C12, C14, and C16. The molecular masses of Unk1, Unk2, and Unk3 were deter-
mined using MS spectra to be 214, 242, and 270, respectively. The presence of potential
PHA monomers was deduced based on their molecular weights to be monounsaturated
monomers: 3-hydroxydodecenoic acid (C12:1), 3-hydroxytetradecenoic acid (C14:1), and
3-hydroxyhexadecenoic acid (C16:1) [143].
A gel permeation chromatography (GPC) system calibrated to standards can estimate
molecular mass and molecular dispersion. However, molecular mass determination analy-
sis of a PHA can become complicated, especially when the polymer is a combination of
several PHAs, so more than two connected GPC columns are required to determine the
molecular weight and distribution [147].Materials 2022 ,15, 1410 17 of 29

used thermal method, we can determine  both qualitative  and quantitative  results because 
of the thermal data of the polymer.  Thus, the endothermic  peak may indicate a maximum

of the polyester  [159].

5.2. Thermal Properties
Using the PHA polymer requires to determine the temperature conditions such as
thermal properties, melting temperatures, and degradation temperatures. The known
melting temperature of a standard PHA is 177C, and, for a copolymer, this is generally
lower than the homopolymer temperature, at about 143C. By DSC analysis, the most-used
thermal method, we can determine both qualitative and quantitative results because of
the thermal data of the polymer. Thus, the endothermic peak may indicate a maximum of
115C, representing the loss of absorbed water, and the exothermic peak between 175C
and 350C could show subsequent recrystallization. All this indicates the high stability of
the polyester [159].
The thermal behavior of mcl-PHA polymers is shown in Figure 7a–c. The DSC
diagrams reveal that the monomer composition has a signiﬁcant impact on thermal behavior.
Melting temperatures range from 50C to 54C, with melting enthalpies ranging from
11 J/g to 15 J/g, indicating a low degree of crystallinity. According to the diagrams included
in Figure 8, the melting behavior is inﬂuenced by the hexanoate concentration, with lowerMaterials 2022 ,15, 1410 18 of 29
C6 fractions of PHAs being associated with lower melting temperatures [ 66]. In addition,
Figure 7c shows DSC thermograms of both polymers by comparison (mcl-PHA obtained
in laboratory and commercial scl-PHA) with differing thermal behaviors. The melting
temperature of mcl-PHA is signiﬁcantly lower than that of scl-PHA, 53C instead of 169C.
Due to the increased length of the CH 2chain in their structure, which obstructs hydrogen
bonding, mcl-PHA acts as a thermoplastic elastomer, with higher chain mobility and a
lower melting temperature. Moreover, mcl-PHA has a greater amorphous/crystalline phase
ratio and, therefore, a lower melting enthalpy: 14 J/g rather than 56 J/g [66].

TGA can determine degradation temperature, and the sample is heated in a controlled
atmosphere to a point, while the mass loss of the polymer is measured [ 154]. Figure 7b
shows the TGA curves for the tested mcl-PHA polymers, which indicates a one- or two-step
degradation process. For all samples, the degradation temperature is higher than 270C.
The samples with a higher C6 concentration ( mcl-PHA 1 and mcl-PHA 3) show a higher
degradation temperature at the beginning (at 279C and 280C, respectively), indicating a
better thermal behavior than those with a lower C6 concentration ( mcl-PHA 2 and mcl-PHA

5.3. Crystallinity  
The crystallinity  of the polymer can be determined  by structural  analysis using FTIR 
or X‐ray diffraction.  FTIR determines  the infrared absorption  wavebands,  which are cor‐
related with the crystallinity  of the material.  Due to the different  chemical  composition  of 
the polymer,  those bands do not have a fixed location.  The bands between 1279 and 1185 
cm−1 are representative  of scl‐PHA and fall between 1500 and 800 cm−1, indicating  the that 
changes occurred  both in the crystalline  phase and the amorphous  phase for mcl‐PHA 
and scl‐mcl‐PHA [160,161].  
For example,  Figure 8 shows the FTIR spectrum  of a mcl‐PHA polymer film com‐
pared to a commercial  scl‐PHA (PHBHV).  As mcl‐PHA is still produced  in the laboratory,  
its structure  is determined  by comparing  it to a PHA with established  features.  Following  
analysis,  it was discovered  that PHBHV has absorbance  peaks between 2975 cm−1 and 2932 
cm−1, which correspond  to asymmetric  and symmetrical  stretching  of the CH 3 vibration,  a 
robust stretching  vibration  of C=O at 1720 cm−1, and wavelengths  between 1280 cm−1 and 
1060 cm−1, which correspond  to C‐O‐C stretching  vibrations.  The essential  diagnostic  
peaks CH 3 and C=O, on the other hand, appear in mcl‐PHA, although  with a slightly mod‐
ified intensity  and displacement.  The wavelength  of CH 3 is measured  between 2957 and 
2931 cm−1, while C=O has a higher intensity  of 1725 cm−1. These observations  could indi‐
cate that both polymers  have different  amorphous/crystalline  phase ratios. In addition,  
the increased  length of the CH 2 chain in mcl‐PHA may explain the higher strength of the 
intense vibrations  for the C‐H group compared  to scl‐PHA [66]. 
X‐ray diffraction  also determines  the crystallinity  rate of the polymer,  the chemical  
bonds and the disorder of the atoms [152].

5.3. Crystallinity
The crystallinity of the polymer can be determined by structural analysis using FTIR or
X-ray diffraction. FTIR determines the infrared absorption wavebands, which are correlated
with the crystallinity of the material. Due to the different chemical composition of the
polymer, those bands do not have a ﬁxed location. The bands between 1279 and 1185 cm 1
are representative of scl-PHA and fall between 1500 and 800 cm 1, indicating the that
changes occurred both in the crystalline phase and the amorphous phase for mcl-PHA and
scl-mcl-PHA [160,161].
For example, Figure 8 shows the FTIR spectrum of a mcl-PHA polymer ﬁlm compared
to a commercial scl-PHA (PHBHV). As mcl-PHA is still produced in the laboratory, its
structure is determined by comparing it to a PHA with established features. Following
analysis, it was discovered that PHBHV has absorbance peaks between 2975 cm 1and
2932 cm 1, which correspond to asymmetric and symmetrical stretching of the CH 3vi-
bration, a robust stretching vibration of C=O at 1720 cm 1, and wavelengths between
1280 cm 1and 1060 cm 1, which correspond to C-O-C stretching vibrations. The essential
diagnostic peaks CH 3and C=O, on the other hand, appear in mcl-PHA, although with a
slightly modiﬁed intensity and displacement. The wavelength of CH 3is measured between
2957 and 2931 cm 1, while C=O has a higher intensity of 1725 cm 1. These observations
could indicate that both polymers have different amorphous/crystalline phase ratios. In
addition, the increased length of the CH 2chain in mcl-PHA may explain the higher strength
of the intense vibrations for the C-H group compared to scl-PHA [66].
X-ray diffraction also determines the crystallinity rate of the polymer, the chemical
bonds and the disorder of the atoms [152].
5.4. Mechanical Properties
The suitable mechanical properties of polymers as scaffolds in tissue engineering
depend on the mechanical characteristics of the natural tissue that they should substitute.
The natural skin, for example, has tensile strength values ranging from 5.0 to 30.0 MPa,
Young’s modulus values between 4.6 and 20.0 MPa, and skin elongation at break values
with the approximate range 35.0–115.0%. As a result, a high mechanical stress is required
to assure the durability of speciﬁc natural structures generated in the skin substitute [ 162].
Another example may be the required qualities of a tracheal cartilage wall, which should
be robust enough to keep the airway open (high elongation at break), but ﬂexible enough
to allow ﬂexion during breathing cycles due to intrathoracic pressure variations (high
tensile strength and Young modulus) [ 163]. The PHA polymer may be a soft elastomericMaterials 2022 ,15, 1410 20 of 29
material such as mcl-PHA or a rigid material such as scl-PHA. The elongation of a material
is determined by measuring its extent until it breaks. In addition, the tensile strength is
determined by applying a pulling force until the material breaks [ 164]. The mechanical
strength of PHA-type biopolymers is inﬂuenced by the carbon chain length, structure,
thermal characteristics, and crystallinity effect. Scl-PHA polymers, such as PHB, are sub-
stantially more rigid than other PHA type polymers, with strengths exceeding 45 MPa and
physical and chemical properties equivalent to standard plastics [ 165]. The disadvantage
of this polymer is that it has a low elongation at break and ages rapidly. To improve these
qualities, they must be combined with other monomers, such as 3HP , 3HV and 4HB to
reduce rigidity, crystallinity, and ageing [ 166]. According to Arcos-Hern ández et al., the
Young (E) modulus ranges are between 779 and 2893 MPa and increase signiﬁcantly when
the HV content is less than 40% mol [ 153]. P4HB is a ductile material with good thermal
properties and elongation at break of up to 1000%, more than PHB, making it the most
elastic homopolymer PHA developed to date [ 166,167]. Compared to scl-PHA, the second
branch of the PHA class, mcl-PHA is more elastic, with a higher elongation at break and
a lower tensile strength. mcl-PHA is a copolymer with tensile strengths ranging from
5 to 16 MPa and elongation at break ranging from 88 to 360%, consisting of 3HHx, 3HO,
3HD, and 3HDD [ 148]. As different copolymers can change the mechanical strength of
PHA, this biopolymer can be used in a variety of combinations that can be designed for
a speciﬁc application. Due to these characteristics, it is more adaptable than polymers
such as PCL, Polyethylene, PLA, etc. [ 168]. A thorough study of the relationships between
PHA crystallinity and polymer composition, compositional distribution, microstructure,
and blend composition is expected to inform future polymer development in the medical
ﬁeld [67].
5.5. Biocompatibility and Biodegradability
After the structural and chemical determination of the biopolymer, to make it suitable
for use in medical applications, it must be biocompatible, bioactive and allow for cell
proliferation. Biocompatibility, bioactivity and biodegradability tests are performed in vitro
by testing on cell culture and in vivo on laboratory animals. After implantation, the human
body has an immune response through the secretion of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines. The
biocompatibility of a PHA polymer is evaluated, and numerous tests were performed
to evaluate the cell adhesion of the biomaterial, because many studies have shown that
these materials resist for a long time until they are biodegraded [ 167]. Cell adhesion on
scl-PHA ﬁlms (PHB and its copolymers) was studied using different cell lines, epithelial
or osteoblasts. Thus, cell cultures that directly contacted polymer ﬁlms showed high cell
adhesion [ 169] and, when in contact with the blood, they had an excellent hemocompatibil-
ity, activating the coagulation system and having low immune reactions, as the number
of lymphocytes tended towards zero [ 170,171]. Another biocompatibility study on a mcl-
PHA polymer was performed on a heart valve obtained from PHO, wherein vascular cells
from the carotid artery of sheep were seeded and implanted in the animal. Following the
in vivo test, it was observed that the implant was covered with tissue and did not show
any thrombus formation, even having a cell growth rate of 46% 7 days after implantation
and a growth rate of up to 116% after 120 days. Thus, it was concluded that the cardiac
devices obtained from PHO could be implanted and have an adequate function for up to
120 days [ 172]. The same thing could be observed in a stent obtained from PHO in the form
of a porous scaffold seeded with vascular cells, tested in vitro for eight days in a simulator.
The cells grew through the material’s pores and formed a uniform layer, which was viable
on the porous scaffold [ 173]. These results indicate that these polymers can be used to
manufacture scaffolds, porous matrices on which host tissue cells can proliferate, and in
soft tissue regeneration.Materials 2022 ,15, 1410 21 of 29
6. Brief Review of PHA Biomedical Applications
Among the various biomaterials available for tissue engineering and therapeutic ap-
plications, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) offer new properties as biomaterials of interest
for medical applications due to their high biocompatibility and biodegradability and their
various thermal-mechanical properties. The microbial polyesters poly 3-hydroxybutyrate
(PHB), polyhydroxyvalerate (PHV) and poly [3-hydroxybutyrate 3-hydroxyvalerate] (PHBV)
were most studied for orthopedic applications in recent decades as bone implants, which
could form new bone in contact, without a chronic inflammatory response [11].
PHBV has been studied by numerous researchers [ 174], due to its biocompatibility with
bone tissue. By degradation in vivo , PHBV forms D-3-hydroxybutyrate, which is normally
found in human blood [ 175]. The biodegradability of PHA is the result of their stereo-
speciﬁc structure with ester bonds, which can be enzymatically degraded in a biological
medium. However, for various medical applications, polyesters need to be improved by
functionalization [99,176].
The ﬁrst commercial product to be approved by the FDA in 2007 was TephaFLEX from
Tepha Medical Devices, a linear thermoplastic polyester produced by a recombinant E. coli
fermentation process. This is an absorbable P (4HB) biopolymer, offering sutures that are
35% stronger than synthetic polydioxanone and 19% stronger than polypropylene [ 177,178].
Thus, P (4HB) can be transformed into a variety of absorbable medical devices, including
sutures, patches, grafts, and textiles such as surgical meshes [179].
Phasix ™mesh is a device made of P4HB [ 180]. It could become a treatment option for
hernia because it has long-term mechanical strength and can prevent further postoperative
complications [ 181,182]. Moreover, the P4HB biopolymer has been successfully imple-
mented in tissue engineering. To increase the variety of uses for PHA-based biomaterials,
researchers have investigated derivatization methods such as epoxidation, carboxylation,
chlorination, hydroxylation, and pyrolysis [ 183,184]. Bioactivity, compatibility, biodegrad-
ability, hydrophobicity, moldability, and other qualities were improved [ 185]. Zibiao Li et al.
recently investigated designed systems of PHA-based water-soluble polymers, functional-
ized PHAs with polar groups, or copolymerization of PHAs with hydrophilic components
in a variety of polymeric designs [ 186]. They demonstrated that chemically modiﬁed water-
soluble PHAs have a considerable impact on material construction and possess remarkable
properties, resulting in suitable intelligent biomaterials [187].
Sutures, slings, stents, repair patches, cardiovascular patches, heart valves, orthopedic
pins, adhesion barriers, cardiovascular tissue engineering devices, articular cartilage, nerve,
tendon, guided tissue repair/regeneration devices, nerve guides, bone marrow scaffolding,
and wound dressings are all made with improved PHAs [188,189].
To date, Phantom Fiber ™is marketed as suture (Tornier Co., Monsanto, MN, USA),
MonoMax®as suture (Braun Surgical Co., Ctra. Rub í, Spain), BioFiber ™as scaffold (P4HB
polymer) (Tornier Co.), GalaFLEX as mesh (Galatea Corp., Bromma, Sweden) and Tornier®
as a surgical mesh (Tornier Co.) [190].
7. Conclusions
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) production presents special features, different from
other well-known microbial polymers (e.g., polysaccharides). One interesting property of
their biological synthesis is the possible use of precursors to induce the biopolymer struc-
ture. However, the published results regarding the fermentation yields contain relatively
low levels of ﬁnal concentrations, possibly due to the stress conditions of media compo-
sition, which limit the bioprocess performance. New genetic engineered mutant strains,
alternative substrates, mixed crops, fed-batch or continuous operation could overcome
such restrictions.
Other challenges are the non-water solubility, intracellular character of the biopolymer,
requesting complex, and difﬁcult and costly steps of isolation and puriﬁcation, especially
for medical applications requiring purity (surgical reconstruction and tissue engineering,Materials 2022 ,15, 1410 22 of 29
involving direct contact with blood). The hydrophobic character could be improved by
hydrophilic functionalization, enlarging the area of applications.
Although only polyhydroxybutyrate have been FDA-approved for such medical
applications to date [ 191], their proven favorable properties (immunologically inert, bio-
compatible, rapid tissue ingrowth, bioresorbable, slow biodegradable tissue scaffolds),
as well as a large number of promising studies with other PHAs, justiﬁes the trust in an
optimistic outlook regarding the development of these biopolymers.
