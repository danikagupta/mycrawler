 ABSTRACT  
Understanding the hydrodynamics of bubble columns with and without vertical 
heat-exchanging tubes is a necessity for the proper design, scale -up, and operation of these 
reactors. To achieve this goal, systematic experiments were performed to visualize and 
quantify the influence of the presence of vertical internal tubes on the gas holdup 
distributions and their profiles, axial liquid velocity, and turbulent parameters (i.e., normal 
and shear stresses; turbulent ki netic energy) by using advanced gamma -ray computed 
tomography (CT) and radioactive particle tracking (RPT). In this study, the experiments 
were conducted in 6 - and 18 -inch bubble columns with an air -water system as the working 
fluid, under a wide range of superficial gas velocities (5 -45 cm/s). Three configurations of 
vertical internals (i.e., hexagonal, circular without a central tube, and circular with a central 
tube plus vertical internals), as well as the vertical internals sizes, were examined in this 
study. These three configurations were designed to cover 25% of the column’s cross -
sectional area (CSA) to represent the percentage of the covered area utilized in the Fischer -
Tropsch process. Reconstructed CT images reveal that the configurations of the v ertical 
internal tubes significantly impacted the gas holdup distribution over the CSA of the 
column. Additionally, the bubble column equipped with 1 -inch vertical internals exhibited 
a more uniform gas holdup distribution than the column with 0.5 -inch int ernals. Moreover, 
a remarkable increase in the gas holdup values at the wall region was achieved in the churn 
turbulent flow regime due to the insertion of vertical internals inside the column. 
Furthermore, pronounced peaks of the gas holdup and axial liqu id velocity were observed 
in the inner gaps between the vertical internals.

1. INTRODUCTION  
As a result of growing world population, growing urbanization, and growing 
middle class, the world energy consumption rate will increase by 48% between  2012 and 
2040 according to the international energy outlook  (Figure 1.1). That means more crude 
oil will be used to meet the energy shortage, which will impact the environment due to 
more fossil fuel emissions. Therefore, there is much more need to improve sustainability 
by seeking clean alternative energy sources to provide more environmentally friendly 
products.  
 
Figure 1.1: World energy consumption between 1990 and 2040 [1]  
 
Among the alternative energy sources, the clean liquid fuels and chemical products 
obtained via Fischer -Tropsch (FT) synthesis have stimulated strong  interest of researchers 
in both industry and academia. This interest in FT synthesis has grown because thi s process 
can use different feedstock such as coal, natural gas, biomass, and biogas through gasifying 
these feedstocks to syngas (i.e., a mixture of CO and H 2) by gasification process. 
Additionally, some of these  feedstocks such  as coal, natural gas, and biomass  are abundant .

 Furthermore, the products of this process are friendly to the environment , which will satisfy 
the environmental laws in the future  [2]. 
Processes  technology  of converting natural gas, coal, and biomass to liquid fuels 
by FT synthesis are typically termed as gas to liq uid (GTL), coal to liquid (CTL), and 
biomass to liquid (BTL)  [3–7]. This technology ha s appeared as an alternative to the 
traditional refining of crude oil and offers new investments in natural and clean resources. 
These  are multistep  processes (G TL, CTL, BTL) for converting different feedstocks (e.g., 
natural gas, coal, biomass, and biogas ) through their conversion to synthesis gas (i.e., CO 
and H 2) into higher molecular weight hydrocarbons using the FT process, as shown  in 
Figure  1.2 The FT process was first invented by Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch in the  
1930s at the Kaiser -Wilhelm (currently Max Plank) Institute for Coal Research in Mulheim 
during World War II to fit the demand for fuel wit h plenty of coal resources  [8].

Different types of multiphase reactors have been used for the  FT process  (Figure 
1.3), such as m ulti-tubular fixed bed, fluidized bed, circulating fluidized bed, and slurry 
bubble column reactors. Nevertheless , slurry bubble  column reactor s have  been selected  
for low -temperature  (200-250 Co) FT synthesis in recent years because they offer  many 
advantages during operation and maintenance processes.

 Bubble and slurry bubble  column  reactors are typically cylindrical columns where 
the gas phase is sparged continuously from the bottom of these columns as bubbles through  
a gas distributor (i.e., gas sparger) into liquid or slurr y (liquid -solid) phases. The solid 
phase in a slurry bubble column reactor consists of  fine catalyst particles with a size range 
of 5-150 µm [9]. The liquid  or slurry phase is usually fed to these columns in co -current or 
counter -current way s and sometimes in batch mode. A schematic diagram of bubble/slurry 
bubble column is displayed in Figure 1.4.

 Depending on the application of these column reactors, the bubble and slurry 
bubble columns can be operated under bubbly flow regime condition s (i.e., under low 
superficial gas velocities) such as in the cultivation process for algae [10] or can be run in 
churn turbulent flow regime (i.e., under high superficial  gas velocities) as in the FT process  
[11]. 
By comparison to other mul tiphase reactors such as fluidized bed and trickle bed 
during the operation and maintenance processes, the bubble and slurry bubbl e columns 
have many advantages, including the following:  
➢ Providing high heat and mass transfer rates because of the efficient contact and 
interaction between the phases (gas -liquid  in bubble column or gas -liquid -solid in 
a slurry bubble column).  
➢ Allowing easy control of the operating temperature . 
➢ Offering sufficient heat recovery by equipping these reactors with a bundle of 
cooli ng tubes.  
➢ Maintaining t he overall activity of the fine catalyst for these columns during the 
operation.  
➢ Capability of online catalyst activation through withdrawal of the inactive catalyst 
and renew ing it by adding a fresh one.  
➢ Ability to handl e high operating pressure due to the absence of moving pieces . 
➢ Eliminating the sever e erosion and plugging problems caused by the catalyst.  
➢ Reducing  manufacturing, operation, and maintenance costs for these columns due 
to their simple construction . 6 
 
 
 These advantages and features of the bubble and slurry bubble columns make them 
superi or to other multiphase reactors for chemical, petrochemical, biochemical, 
pharmaceutical, metallurgical, and mineral industrial processes.  The FT synthesis  [12], 
liquid phase methanol synthesis (LPMeoH)  [13], hydrogenation of maleic acid (MAC)  
[14], acetic acid production  [15], cyclohexanol manufacturing  [16], and many others are 
examples  of uses of  these reactors in chemical and petrochemic al processes.  Additionally, 
they are  used widely in biochemical and pharmaceutical industries such as algae and 
bacteria culturing  [17], mold fungi  culturing  [18], antibiotic fermentation  [19], single cell 
protein  production  [20], animal cell  culturing  [21], and sewage  and waste water  treatment  
[22]. 
Most of the uses of these bubble and slurry bubble column reactors involve 
exothermic reactions such as Fischer -Tropsch synthesis and many others as displayed in 
Table 1.1. When these exothermic chemical reactions occur, excess heat releases to mixture 
materials , causes overheating of the catalyst , and consequently affect s the reaction 
selectivity. This is co nsidered a major problem in the design and safe operation of these 
reactors.  
This issue of excess heat generated from the exothermic  chemical  reaction  in these 
reactors can be solved by inserting a bundle of vertical cooling tubes, where the heat can 
be extracted by converting the cooling water to saturated steam which can benefit  other 
process units. However, the presence of dense vertical heat -exchanging tubes impacts the 
fluid dynamics, mixing intensity, heat and mass transfer rates, reaction rate , and 
consequently the performance of these reactors. It is well known that the process of scale -
up and design of these reactors  in the absence of heat -exchanging tubes  are still challenging 7 
 
 
 engineering task s due to the absence of phenomenological model s which can describe the 
hydrodynamics of these reactors accurately.  
Additionally, these tasks are challenging due to the lack of reliable hydrodynamics 
information over a wide range of industrial operating conditions, especially in the 
bubble/slurry bubbl e column reactors with vertical heat -exchanging tubes. This lack comes 
from the complexity of the interaction among the phases which further increase in the 
presence of vertical heat exchanging tubes. Therefore, there is a great  need for detailed 
knowledge  of hydrodynamics , which is extremely important for proper design, scale -up, 
and simulation for bubble and slurry bubble column reactors  with intense internals .

 1.1. RESEARCH MOTIVATION  
Although using these heat-exchanging  tubes extensively in the industrial 
application s of bubble/slurry bubble columns for exothermic reactions, a limited number 
of studies have addr essed the effects of these heat -exchanging tubes on the hydrodynamics 
and bubble properties of these reactors.   
Among these limited studies , Chen et al.  [24] performed the first comprehensive 
study of the hydrodynamics of the bubble column in the prese nce of the vertical internals 
by employing computer automat ic radioactive particle tracking (CARPT) and computed 
tomography (CT) techniques. The authors  performed their experiments in 18-inch bubble 
column s with and without vertical internal tubes for two systems including air -water and 
air-drakeoil system. The vertical internal tubes used in their investigation were arranged in 
a circular configuration inside the bubble column, as shown in Figure 1. 5. These internal 
tubes were designed to cover 5% of the total cross -sectional area (CSA) of the column , 
similar to the o ccupied area by industrial heat -exchanging tubes for methanol synthesis.  
They applied a limited range of superficial gas velocity of 2 -10 cm/s. Their experimental 
results in terms of gas holdup distributions and their profiles for the bubble column s with 
and without vertical internals reveal that under a superficial gas veloci ty of 10 cm/s, 
axisymmetric gas holdup distribution was obtained in a fully developed flow regime for 
two studied systems (air -water and air -drakeoil). Additionally, the magnitude of the gas 
holdup in the presence of vertical internals was slightly higher  than in the column without 
vertical internals. Moreover, they reported that the presence of vertical internals has 
insignificant effects on the liquid circulation velocity for the studied superficial gas 9 
 
 
 velocity conditions. Furthermore, they found that th e turbulent stresses and eddy 
diffusivities significantly decrease in the existence of these vertical internal tubes.  
 
Figure 1. 5: Configuration of vertical internals inside an 18 -inch bubble column [24]  
 
Forret  and co -workers  [25] studied the impacts of the presence of a bundle of the 
vertical internals on axial liquid v elocity and liquid mixing in 1 m diameter bubble column 
with an air -water system and under a superficial gas velocity of 15 cm/s by implementing 
Pitot tube and standard tracer method. The vertical internals employed in their work have 
covered 25% of the to tal cross -sectional area (CSA) of the bubble column and are arranged 
in a square pitch inside the column. The author noted that the fluctuat ions of the liquid 
velocity and radial dispersion decreased while the liquid circulation was increased in the 
presence of the vertical internals, as shown in Figure 1.6. Also, they found that 
implementing the standard one -dimensional (1D) axial dispersion model to  predict the 
liquid mixing is still applicable in large -scale bubble columns in the absence of the vertical 
27 cm  
17 cm  
2.54 cm  in diameter  10 
 
 
 internal tubes. However, this model is not appropriate for the bubble column with the 
presence of vertical internals. Therefore, the author develope d a 2D model to account for 
the effects of the vertical internals on the liquid mixing in radial and axial direction.  
 
 
Figure 1.6: Schematic  illustration of liquid recirculation in bubble columns without and 
with vertical internal tubes  [25] 
 
Larachi  et al.  [26] performed the first 3D CFD simulation study for a bubble co lumn 
equipped with vertical internals. Larachi's group simulated the influence of vertical 
internals on the liquid circulation in a bubble column by using a two-fluid Euler model. In 
their study, five pilot and large -scale bubble column s with and without vertical internals 
operating with an air -water system under a supe rficial gas velocity of 12 cm/s were 
simulated to assess the impacts of these vertical internal tubes on the liquid circulation and 
mixing behavior. In their simulation, th e vertical internals were arranged in four different 
configurations ( Figure 1.7) to address the effect of these configurations on the 
hydrodynamics of these reactors.  Their simulation reveals that the gas holdup distribution 
obtained in the bubble column with vertical internals was entirely different from the one 
achieved in the co lumn without vertical internals, where the large -scale and coherent 
a) bubble column without vertical internals  
 b) bubble column with vertical internals  11 
 
 
 meandering gas twirls that were obtained in the bubble column without vertical internals 
were replaced by smaller pocket whose size was governed by inter -tube gaps. Also, they 
reported that the vertical internal arrangements have a significant effect on th e flow 
behavior . Vertical internals arranged uniformly inside the column produce flow behavior 
similar to bubble co lumn without vertical internals, while internals arranged non -uniformly 
inside column produce complex flow behavior. Furthermore, they found that the liquid 
turbulent kinetic energy remarkably reduced when the vertical internal tubes were inserted 
inside th e bubble column.  
 This work contributes a lot to the field of bubble column with vertical internals ; 
however, their simulations were built o n questionable assumptions.  For example, they 
assumed constant bubble diameter (5 and 19 mm) while their simulations had been done 
on churn turbulent flow regime (12 cm/s), which is characterized by a wide range of bubble 
sizes (5 mm to 5 cm)  [27] due to coalescence and break -up of bubbles. Additionally, the 
authors applied only drag force as the interfacial force in their simulation and ignor ed 
others such as lift force, turbulent dispers ion force, and added mass force, e ven though 
some studies  have  reported that incorporating some or all the interfacial forces will improve 
the prediction of flow pattern [28]. Furthermore, the simulation results for a bubble co lumn 
with internals were not validated via any benchmark experimental data  due to the lack of 
experimental data of details hydrodynamics for bubble column with vertical internals at 
that time . 12

Youssef and Al -Dahhan  [29] conducted the first systematic study of b ubble 
dynamics in the bubble column with vertical internals. In their study, the local gas holdup 
and bubble properties such as gas -liquid interfacial area, bubble chord length, and bubble 
velocity distributions were measured in an 8-inch (19 cm) diameter bubble column by 
implementing the four-point optical fiber probe technique. The local gas holdup and bubble 
properties were measured in the 8 -inch bubble column with and without vertical internals 
for an air -water system under different superficial gas vel ocities that ranged from 3 -20 
cm/s. In their study, they examined the influen ce of vertical internals, which covered 5% 
and 22% of the total cross -sectional area (CSA) of the column to represent heat -exchanging 
tubes used in the LPMeoH synthesis and the FT  process, respectively. The vertical internal s 
that cover ed 5% of the total cross -sectional area were arranged in a circular configuration , 
while the vertical internals that occupied 25 % of the total CSA were organ ized in a 
a) bubble column with dense internals (253 internals)  
 b) bubble column with sparse internals (31)  
c)bubble column with star internals (121) (wall clearance)  
d)bubble column with star internals (132) (core clearance)  13 
 
 
 hexagonal arrangement, as shown in Figure 1.8. Their experimental results and analysis 
showed that the presence of dense vertical internals (i.e., cover ing 22% of CSA) caused an 
incre ase in the local gas holdup and specific interfacial area. However, insignificant 
impacts were observed on the local gas holdup and bubble properties when the fewer  of 
the vertical internals (i.e., occupy ing 5% of CSA) were  present inside the column. Also, 
the authors found that the bubble chord length was decreased in the bubble column 
equipped densely with vertical internals, which in turn caused a decrease in the bubble rise 
velocity.

Boutet et al. [30] utilized computational fluid dynamic s (CFD) to simulate the 
hydrodynamic/ther mal coupling in a 15.1 cm diameter bubble column equipped with a 
bundle of two U -shaped cooling tubes  ( Figure 1.9) at a superficial gas velocity of 0.343 
m/s for air -sylthem XLT  (i.e., heat transfer fluid)  system. They reported that the gas holdup 
in the center column with internals was less than  that in a  column without internals , while 
higher axial liquid velocity was obtained  in the bubble column with internals than the

 column without internals. Addition ally, they conclude d that the local eddy length scale was 
reduced  in the presence of internals. Furthermore, the heat removal was found to be 
significantly affected by the position of internals.

Youssef and et al . [31] extended their investigations to an 18-inch pilot-scale bubble 
column with vertical internals to address and asses s the influence of these vertical internal 
tubes on the local gas holdup and bubble properties of an air -water system by using the 
same four -point  optical fiber  probe technique. The author employed the same 
configurations (i.e., circular and hexagonal arra ngements) of vertical internals that was 
used in their previous work as shown in Figure 1.8. They conducted their experiments 
under the churn turbulent flow regime meet the industrial conditions in terms of superficial 
gas velocities (i.e., 20, 30 45 cm/s). The authors noticed that the existence of dense vertical 
internals (i.e., covering 25% of the total CSA) increase s the overall and local gas holdup 
magnitude for the studied superficial gas velocities. Additionally, they found that the 
specific interfacial area was remarkably incr eased in the wall region of the bubble column 
2.67 cm 
15.1 cm 15 
 
 
 equipped densely with vertical internals while the bubble chord lengths were sig nificantly 
decreased. Moreover, the impact of using different sizes of the bubble columns with 
vertical internal s was found insign ificant on the local gas holdup and bubble properties.  
Hamed [32] implemented different advanced measurement techniques such as four -
point optical fiber probe, gas tracer, and optical oxygen probe to address the influence of 
vertical internals and column diameter s on the bubble properties, axial gas mixing, and 
overall volumetric mass transfer. In addition to his measurements, he developed and 
validated a 2D model to predict the gas velocity profile in a bubble column in the absence 
and the presence of vertical internals. The author conducted his experiments in different 
sizes of column , including 8 and 18 -inch bubble column s with and without vertical 
internals (i.e., the same columns and ve rtical internals configurations used in the st udy of 
Youssef and et al.  [31]) under high superficial gas velocities (particularly at 20, 30, and 45 
cm/s). His measurement and analysis disclose that the presence of vertical internals caused 
an increase in the center -line gas velocity and a significant decrease in the axial gas mixing , 
while gas -liquid mass transfer coefficient was decreased after inserting these vertical 
internal tubes. Also, he  concluded that the observed enhancement in the gas circulation and 
the increase in the magnitude of gas mixing were  caused by increasing the diameter of the 
bubble column.  
Guan et al. [33] investigated the bubble behavior numerically in terms of the bubble 
trajectory, bubble shape, bubble rise velocity, and bubble breakup and turbulence by using  
the volume fluid (VOF) model. In their simulation, they built g eometries for vertical 
internals arranged in a square and triangular pitch with different percentage of covered 
cross -sectional area (CSA) by vertical internals (mainly 5, 10, 20%). These simulations 16 
 
 
 were performed for one compartment (i.e., single gap) be tween vertical internals for square 
and triangular arrangements, as displayed in Figure 1.10. Their simulation results for single 
bubble behavior show that the walls of the vertical internals have significant effects on the 
single bubble behavior in terms of the bubble breakup  and tu rbulent structures. 
Additionally, they observed that the characteristics of vertical internals such as pitch type 
(i.e., square and triangular) and the percentage of the occupied area by these internal tub es 
have an impact on the rocking intensity of the b ubble and its frequency. Furthermore, the 
bubble rise velocity was found to be decreased strongly with the increase of the percentage 
of occluded cross -sectional area  (CSA) by these vertical internal tubes.

Guan et al. [34] experimentally studied the influence of the presence of pin-fin 
tubes and their arrangements on the gas holdup and liquid velocity in 0.8  m bubble column

 total cross -sectional area of the column and were arranged uniformly and non -uniformly 
over the column cross -sectional area, as displayed in Figure 1.11. The non -uniform 
arrangement of these pin -fin tubes was created by symmetrically removing two tubes that 
were close to the wall region, as shown Figure 1.11b. Their experimental data indicated 
that the gas holdup and liquid velocity were strongly affected by using the pin -fin tubes 
instead of the plain tubes, where the presence of pin -fin tubes inside the bubble column 
significantly reduce d the height of the distributor region as compared to the bubble column 
with plain tubes. Also, they found the non -uniform arrangement of pin -fin tubes produce a 
complicated flow pattern , where this arrangement creates sever e gas short -circuiting and 
even no downflow for liquid in this area . The flow pattern was not changed much when 
the non -uniform arrangement of plain tubes was used  as compared to the bubble column 
with pin -fin tubes .

 Extensive investigations in the Multiphase Reactors Engineering and Applications 
Laboratory (mReal) at Missouri University of Science and Technology in the field of 
bubble column reactors have also covered studies on the bubble column with vertical 
interna ls. Among these extensive investigations, Kagumba and Al -Dahhan  [35] addressed 
the influence of the presence of vertical internals and their sizes on the local gas ho ldup, 
bubble passage frequency, specific interfacial area, bubble chord lengths, and axial bubble 
velocity in 6 -inch bubble column s for an air -water system by employing a four -point 
optical fiber probe. The vertical internal tubes for both diameters  occupi ed 25% of the total 
cross -sectional area of the column, representing the heat -exchanging tubes used in the 
industrial Fischer -Tropsch (FT) synthesis. The 0.5 -inch diameter of vertical internal tubes 
was arrang ed in a hexagonal configuration, while 1 -inch t ubes were organized in a circular 
arrangement over the column's cross -sectional area, as shown in Figure 1.12. The author 
also assessed the impact of using total and the free cross -sectional  area for calculati ng 
operating superficial gas velocity for the bubble column with the vertical internals on t he 
local gas holdup and bubble properties. They reported that under a high superficial gas 
velocity condition (i.e., under a churn turbulent flow regime), the effect of using smaller 
vertical internals (i.e., 0.5 -inch diameter) was insignificant on the ove rall and local gas 
holdup magnitudes  if the superficial gas velocity remain same based on the free cross -
sectional area for the flow .  However, an enhancement in the bubble passage frequency, an 
increase in the specific interfacial area, and a decrease in the magnitude of bubble rise 
velocity were  observed based on using 0.5 -inch vertical internals. Additionally, they 
concluded that considering the total cross -sectional area to calculate the operating gas 
velocity in the bubble column with vertical internal s caused misleading results. 19 
 
 
 Interestingly, they found that the overall and local gas holdups achieved in the bubble 
column with vertical internals can be obtained in the bubble column with vertical internals 
when these columns with vertical internals oper ate under a high superficial gas velocity 
and these gas velocities calculated based on the free -cross -sectional area for the flow.  This 
investigation has enhanced the fundamental understanding and has enriche d data of the 
bubble dynamics for the bubble col umn equipped densely with vertical internals, which is 
entirely missing in the open literature as highlighted by Guan et al.  [33]. However, this 
study does not maintain the similarity of the configurations for both diameters of vertical 
internals where the 0.5 -inch vertical internal tubes wer e arranged in a hexagonal shape, 
while the 1 -inch vertical internals were arranged in a circu lar arrangement over the cross -
sectional area of the column. Thus, the variation in the gas holdup and bubble properties 
could be because of the vertical internal configurations, not their sizes. Therefore, there is 
much need to address and assess the effe ct of the size of vertical internals when they are 
arranged in a similar configuration.

 Jasim  [36] addressed the issue of maintaining the similar configurations when he 
studied the effects of the presence  of vertical internals, their diameters , and their 
arrangements  on the local gas holdup, gas -liquid interfacial area, bubbl e passage 
frequency, bubble chord length, and bubble rise velocity by utilizing the four-point optical 
fiber probe technique.  His experiments were carried out in a 6-inch bubble column for an 
air-water system under a wide range of superficial gas velocity that covered the bubbly, 
transition, and churn turbulent flow regimes (2 -45 cm/s calculated based on free CSA for 
the columns with vertical internals). The vertical internal tubes in this investigation were 
selected for blocking 25% of the total cross -sectional area (CSA) of the column to represent 
the same oc cupied space by industrial heat -exchanging tubes for the Fischer -Tropsch (FT) 
process. In this study, both sizes of the vertical internals were arranged in a circular 
configuration  (Figure 1.13) over the cross -sectional area of the column to accurately assess 
and quantify the effect of the presence of the vertical internals and their size on the bubble 
dynamics.  
 In his study, Jasim  found that the local gas holdup and specific interfacial area were 
enhanced in the wall region of the bubble column with 1 -inch vertical internals compared 
to the bubble column without and with 0.5 -inch vertical internals. Also, he reported that 
vertical internal  configurations strongly impact the bubble dynamics as compared to the 
bubble column in the absence of vertical internals.  Moreover, Jasim concluded that the 0.5 -
inch internals with a circular configuration gave symmetric gas holdup profiles along the 
diameter of the column, while the 0.5 -inch internals with the hexagonal arrangement led to 
a distinct asymmetric gas holdup diameter profile.  21

Al-Dahhan and co -authors  [37,38]  were  among one of the first research group s that 
visualized and quantif ied the presence of dense heat -exchanging tubes on the cross -
sectional gas holdup distribution and their profiles, 3D liquid velocity field, Reynolds 
stresses, turbulent kinetic energy, and turbulent eddy diffusivities in a non -invasive way by 
using advanced gamma -ray computed tomography (CT) and radioactive particle tracking 
(RPT) techniques. This detailed hydrodynamic s study was conducted in 6 -inch bubble 
columns in the absence and presence of vertical internals for air -water -system under a wide 
range of sup erficial gas velocities, which were covered homogenous (bubbly flow regime) 
and heterogeneous (churn flow regime) flow regimes (i.e., 5 -45 cm/s) . A bundle of 30 
vertical tubes arranged in a hexagonal configuration  (Figure 1.14) and block ing 25% of the 
total cross -sectional area of the bubble column was chosen by the investigators to match 
the percentage of occupied area for the industrial FT synthesis. Their tomography images 
revealed that the gas holdup distributions for the columns with and without vertical 
internals were almost symmetric for all studied superficial gas velocities except for high 
superficial gas velocities in the bubble column with the  presence of vertical internals. Their

 results also indicated that the presence of vertical internals significantly increased the 
centerline and negative axial liquid velocity under any studied superficial gas velocity. 
Furthermore, they found that the nor mal and shear stresses, turbulent kinetic energy, and 
eddy diffusivity of liquid phase sharply decreased when the column was equipped with 
vertical internals.

Guan and Yang [39] numerical analyzed the influence of involving more than 
interfacial forces such as lift force, turbulent dispersion force and wall force beside to the 
drag force on the pr ediction the hydrodynamics in a pilot -scale bubble column with and 
without internals for the air -water system under operating superficial gas velocities of 12 
and 31 cm/s. The researchers performed their simulation for 48 -cm bubble columns without 
and with  vertical internal tubes that were arranged in a triangular pitch and blocked 5% of 
the total cross -sectional area of the column , as displayed in  Figure 1.15. Based on their 
simulation results , they concluded that incorporating lateral forces such as lift force, 
turbulent dispersion force and wall force with the drag force is optional for simulation 
bubble column without vertical internals while the lateral forces are required for the bubble

 colum n with the vertical internals to predict the hydrodynamics of these columns 
accurately.

Recently, an investigation of the li quid phase hydrodynamic and mixing behavior 
in bubble columns equipped with vertical internals was performed by Kalaga et al.  [40,41] . 
The primary goal of their investigation was to examine the influence of vertical internal 
tubes, superficial gas and liquid velocity on the gas holdup distribution, axial liquid 
velocity, liq uid mixing behavior in the bubble columns with different configurations of 
vertical internals by using radioactive particle tracking (RPT) and residence time 
distribution (RTD) techniques. Their study was carried out in a 12-cm inner diameter 
bubble column  in which both air and water were fed concurrently. Six different vertical 
internals configurations which were covered a wide range of occupied cross -sectional area 
of the column (i.e., 0 -63% of the total CSA of the column) was examined in this study, as 
shown in Figure 1.16. However, due to the practical limitations of RPT technique, RPT 
experiments were conducted in batch mode bubble columns without an d with 1 and 5 
vertical internals while the RTD experiments were performed for continuous bubble

 column without and with vertical internals (all configurations of internals). The obtained 
experimental results in terms of gas holdup distribution, axial liqu id velocity, and the liquid 
phase dispersion coefficient were found to be strongly impacted by superficial gas velocity, 
liquid velocity, and vertical internals configuration.

experiments (a -c) and RTD (a -f) experiments  [40] 
 
According to the preceding investigations and discussion, the m ajority of these 
studies was conducted by using a probe -based technique. The probes are invasive, and even 
they are small sizes still providing a point measurement (i.e., local points) that requires 
extensive experimental work to assess the effect of the o perating and design parameters. 
Other reported studies did not focus on the dense of vertical internals and limit for a fewer 
number of vertical internals due to the limitation of measurement technique. Among other

 hydrodynamic studies for the bubble colum n with dense vertical internals, only Al Mesfer 
et al. investigated the effect of these vertical internal tubes on the details of hydrodynamics 
by using non -invasive techniques such as CT and RPT. However, it was limited to one 
geometry configuration (hexa gonal arrangement), one size of tubes (0.5 -inch) and one size 
of the column (6 -inch).  
Accordingly, the reported studies on the bubble column with vertical internals have 
some limitations as mentioned earlier and hence they are insufficient for adequately 
understanding the impact of the vertical internals on the hydrodynamics of these reactors. 
Therefore, the primary goal of this investigation is to improve the fundamental 
understanding of the impacts of these vertical internal tubes on the hydrodynamics of the 
bubble column. To achieve this goal, a close investigation of the influence of vertical 
internals, their diameters, their configurations on the cross -sectional gas holdup 
distributions and their profiles, axial liquid velocity, and turbulent parameters , is much 
needed.  
The knowledge and findings acquired from this work along with the previous 
investigations in terms of the hydrodynamics and bubble properties will significantly 
enrich and improve the understanding of the influence of heat -exchanging tube s on the 
performance of the bubble and slurry bubble columns. Additionally, it will provide 
valuable hydrodynamics information, which can be used for developing, designing, and 
scaling up these kinds of reactors. Moreover, these unique experimental results  can be used 
as benchmarking data to evaluate and validate CFD simulations and mechanistic 
phenomenological models, which in turn will facilitate the processes of the design, scale -
up, and operation of these reactors. Furthermore, the obtained results and findings can be 26 
 
 
 applied to boiling water reactors which are used for generating electrical power, where 
these reactors are equipped with a bundle of intense fuel rods that evaporate the water and 
turns it into steam which powers the turbine .

ABSTRACT  
This study identifies and addresses some major pitfalls that are involved in the 
visualization and quantification of the gas -liquid distributions and their profiles in the 
bubble column with internals using the gamma -ray computed tomography (CT) technique.  
Some of these pitfalls encountered in the scanning of bubble columns with internals are 
using an improper reference scan, applying the same experimental scanning procedure and 
mathematical relationships for estimating the gas holdup in the column without internals 
to the column with internals. The experimental results revealed that the selection of the 
inappropriate reference scan for CT experiments would significantly affect the 
reconstructed linear attenuation coefficient values and consequently the gas holdup results. 
Additionally, the reconstructed linear attenuation values showed good agreement with 
theoretical values when considering air as reference scans. However, disagreement is 
observed when using the empty column with internals as a reference sca n. Moreover, it 
was found that using the proper reference scan eliminated the errors not only for the 
reconstructed linear attenuation coefficients but also for the gas holdup values near the wall 
region. Furthermore, the CT technique was capable of captur ing the small thickness (5 mm) 
of the wall for phantom and bubble columns as well as the internals when the air was used 32 
 
 
 as the reference scan. Finally, a new methodology has been implemented to exclude the 
internals from the cross -sectional images, and th e azimuthally averaged gas holdup profiles 
to provide accurate and reliable results for comparison and validation purposes for the 
bubble column with internals.  
Keywords:  Bubble column wi th internals, cross -sectional gas holdup , CT technique.

1. INTRODUCTION  
Bubble and slurry bubble column reactors have been extensively used  in industrial 
processes, particularly in chemical and biochemical, petroleum and petrochemical, 
metallurgical and waste treatment processes .[1–4] Most industrial utilizations of the 
bubble/slurry bubble columns include exothermic react ions such as methanol synthesis 
(LPMeOH), Fischer -Tropsch (FT) synthesis and many others .[5] The removal of heat 
generated to maintain the process isothermally is an important consideration for design, 
scale -up, and safe operation  of these types of the reactors.[6,7] 
Bubble/slurry bubble column reactors equipped with a bundle of the heat -
exchanging tubes are considered  favorable for conducting highly exothermic reactions due 
to their capability of removing  the generated heat efficiently,  and they can be operated 
isothermally in the absence of axial and radial gradient temperature .[8,9] However, the 
presence of the heat -exchanging tubes alters the hydrodynamics of the bubble/slurry bubble 
columns and consequently, significantly affects the performance, yield, and selectivity of 
these reactors .[10–15] 33 
 
 
 Gas holdup distribution is among the most important  hydrodynamic parameters 
governing the liquid /slurry circulation in bubble/slurry bubble columns, and hence 
governing the rate of mixing, mass, an d heat transfer, which in turn controls the 
performance of these reactors .[16–23] Quantification of the gas holdup distributions and their 
profiles in these columns equipped with a bundle of the heat exchanging tubes is necessary 
to advance understanding the hydrodynamics of these multiphase flow systems and to 
validate and evaluate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and hydrodynamic 
models.  
Various measurement devices can be used to measure gas holdup in bubble/slurry 
bubble columns, such as fiber optical probes, conductivity probes, differential pressure 
probes, ultrasonic techniques, electrical capacitance tomography, X -ray tomography, 
gamma -ray densitometry, and gamma -ray computed tomography (CT) .[24–30] However, 
gamma -ray computed tomography is superior to other techniques due to its capability to 
visualize and measure gas holdup over the entire cross -sectional area of the column in 
dense and opaque flows that are not visible  to other measurement devices due to their 
limitation to measure in single points (such as probe -based measurement) or their a low 
penetration capability to pass through the high attenuating mate rial (such as X -ray 
tomography).[31–35] 
In the past three decades, the CT technique has been successfully used to visualize 
and quantify gas -liquid distributions and their profiles in the bubble column without 
vertical internal tubes. However, the path of scanning a bubble column equipped densely 
with vertical internal tubes is floored with some pitfalls. These pitfalls of the scanning 
bubble c olumn with vertical internal tubes are listed here as follows:  34 
 
 
 • Choosing an improper reference scan.  
• Using an inappropriate experimental procedure for scanning a bubble 
column with vertical internal tubes.  
• Implementing an inappropriate relationship for the  estimation local gas 
holdup based on the reconstructed linear attenuation coefficient (𝜇,𝑐𝑚−1). 
• Failure to properly quantify the azimuthally gas holdup profiles of a bubble 
column with vertical internal tubes.  
Unlike scanning a bubble column in the abse nce of vertical internal tubes, scanning 
a column with a presence of vertical tubes is a difficult and challenging task. Therefore, 
there is a need to carefully avoid and address the above issues and concerns to scan a bubble 
column with vertical tubes tha t provide correct and reliable gas holdup distribution and 
their profiles.  
 The measurement of gas holdup distribution by the gamma -ray computed 
tomography (CT) technique requires several independent  scans for the bubble columns 
equipped with a bundle  of vertical internals  at different operating conditions (empty 
column, a column  filled with water only (not flowing), and a column containing air -water 
(flowing)). However, proper selection of the reference scan to account for the incident 
counts ( 𝐼°) at the gamma ray source for the Beer -Lambert model ((𝐼/𝐼°)=𝑒−𝜇𝐿) 
represents  the most important  step in the data processing to achieve the correct transmission 
ratio, accurate reconstructed  linear attenuation coefficients ( 𝜇, cm-1), and consequently 
reliable  estimation of the gas holdup distribution. The 𝐼° represents the initial intensity of 
the gamma ray at the source, which is difficult to measure in the gamma -ray computed 35 
 
 
 tomography scanner because the detectors are located at a certain distance from the 
gamma -ray source.  
 For convenience, CT experiments that scan empty columns placed in the center of 
the CT technique are often used as reference scans that provides the attenuation of the 
column wall materials to the gamma ray that is negligible (s uch as with aluminum) or is 
considered negligible due to the small thickness of the wall when the material of the column 
wall attenuates the gamma ray (like with Plexiglas or a stainless -steel column wall). 
Additionally, the line beams of the gamma ray fro m the source toward its detectors 
arranged in an arc (3rd generation of CT) pass different lengths through the column wall 
since the collimator’s source is made to provide fan beams to the arc arrangement of the 
detectors. If the wall materials of the colu mn attenuate the gamma ray noticeably, then the 
empty column as a reference scan could affect the quality, accuracy, and the reliability of 
the results significantly by considering that the attenuation of the wall is negligible due to 
the small thickness o f the wall. Additionally, considering the column with vertical internal 
tubes as the reference scan, this could be problematic whether the materials of the internals 
are from low attenuated materials to gamma rays (such as aluminum) or high attenuated 
mate rials to gamma rays (such as steel or even Plexiglas). Moreover, using the same 
experimental scanning procedure and mathematical equations to estimate the local gas 
holdup for the bubble column without vertical internal tubes to the column with vertical 
tubes can lead to incorrect values of the gas holdup.  
Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish an experimental scanning procedure 
and mathematical equations to precisely estimate gas holdup in the bubble column 
equipped with vertical internal tubes.  Furthermore, the cross -sectional gas holdup 36 
 
 
 distribution and the azimuthally averaged gas holdup profile in the presence of the vertical 
internals tend to produce a significant error and lead to inaccuracies in the estimation of 
the gas holdup profiles if the same algorithm and programs are used  for the column without 
vertical internals.  
These situations and conditions cause pitfalls in the results of gamma ray CT 
scanner’ and need to be addressed and analyzed properly. Owing to the complexity of 
multiphase flow in the bubble column equipped with vertical internal tubes and limitations 
of measurement techniques, unfortunately no systematic study has been taken and reported 
that analyzes such effects. Accordingly, this study tackles these issues systematically to 
bring the attention to researchers of the proper steps, procedure, and model eq uations that 
can be used to produce reliable CT results. In this work, an experimental scanning method, 
mathematical equations for correctly calculating gas holdup for two (air -water) and three 
(air-water with internals) phases, and methodology for excludi ng the internals from gas 
holdup distributions and their azimuthally averaged profiles have been established and 
developed to overcome the pitfalls caused by using improper methods and mathematical 
equations in addition to the pitfalls due to the type of r eference scans used.  
 The major outcome of this study is to provide confidence in CT measuring in 
general and in calculating the time -averaged cross -sectional gas holdup distributions and 
their profiles for the bubble columns equipped with or without a bundle of heat -exchangin g 
tubes. Outlining and addressing the pitfalls that are associated with scanning bubble 
columns with vertical internal tubes will help and guide those scanning these columns to 
avoid these pitfalls and provide reliable gas holdup distribution and their pro files.  37 
 
 
 2. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP  
In this work , all the measurements of the time -averaged cross -sectional gas holdup 
distributions and their profiles were performed  in a Plexiglas bubble column with an inner 
diameter of 5.5 in. (0.14 m) and a  height of 72 in. (1.8 3 m), as shown schematically in 
Figure 1. During the experiments, the bubble column was operated using compressed oil -
free dry air for the gas phase and purified water for the liquid phase.  
 The compressed atmospheric air was supplied  by an industrial -scale air 
compressor (Ingersoll Rand Company), which can provide compressed air at a flow rate of 
0.35 m3/s with a working pressure of 200 psi. The compr essed air was filtered, dried, and 
regulated by using the air filter, dryer, and regulator pressure before entering a set of 
flowmeters. These flowmeters consist  of two calibrated flowmeters (Brooks Instrument 
Company) connected parallel to cover a wide  range of superficial gas velocity (0.05 -0.45 
m/s). Air was introduced continuously into the bubble column at the bottom through the 
plenum and gas distributor, while water was in a batch mode during all measurements.  
The gas distributor used in this work wa s a perforated plate located above the 
plenum. The plate had 121 holes, each 0.132 cm in diameter and arranged in a triangular 
pitch of 1.016 cm, offering a total open area of 1.09%, as shown in Figure 2. It is important 
to mention that with these characteristics of th is gas distributor, the liquid weeping 
condition (i.e., weeping some liquid into the plenum chamber of the column) was not 
encountered in these experiments due to high superficial gas velocity was applied (i.e., 45 
cm/s) in this study.  38 
 
 
 Additionally, the dimensionless capacitance number ( 𝑁𝐶) was calculated by Eq. 1 
to characterize the flow conditions of the bubbles through the orifices of this gas 
distributor .[36–38] 
𝑁𝐶=4𝑉𝑐ℎ𝑔𝜌𝑙
𝜋𝑑𝑜2𝑃ℎ (1) 
where 𝑉𝑐ℎ represents the volume of the plenum chamber (m3); 𝑔 represents gravitational 
acceleration (m/s2), 𝜌𝑙 represents the density of the liquid (kg/m3), 𝑑𝑜 represents the orifice 
diameter (m), 𝑃ℎ represents the hydrostatic pressure at the orifice plate (MPa). Under a 
condition of 𝑁𝐶 smaller than 1, the flow rate of bubbles through the orifice of the gas 
distributor is invariant (i.e., constant flow conditions) while for 𝑁𝐶 higher than 9 the fl ow 
condition is variable (i.e., gas flow rate generates variable pressure) .[39,40] However, the 
calculated 𝑁𝐶 for this gas distributor is 1.65 (which lies between 1 and 9), which indicates 
there no weeping under studied superficial gas velocity.  Vertical Plexiglas tubes with 1 in. 
(2.54 cm) in diameter covering ~25% of the total cross -sectional area of the column were  
used in this study to represent the same cross -sectional area occluded by industrial heat -
exchanging tubes used in Fischer -Tropsch synthesis.[41–43] These internals  were arranged  
in a circular configuration, which consisted of one bundle of seven internals surrounding 
one vertical internal at the center, as exhibited in Figure 3. It is worth mentioning that these 
internal tubes were placed and secured vertically inside the bubble column at a distance 3 
in. (0.0762 m) above the gas distributor and extended  up to the end of the column by using 
three circular supports (spacers) and the upper plate to omit the vibration and make them 
more stable during the experiments.  The Plexiglas material for the column wall and vertical 
internals has been selected in this study for promoting eye visualization despite its linear 39 
 
 
 attenuation coefficient (0.098 cm-1) being higher than water (0.086 cm-1). However, it 
would be best to overcome the Plexiglas issue by using a material for the column wall and 
vertical internals or the vertical internals alone that has a low linear attenuation coefficient. 
This should be  considered for future studies. In this study, the averaged dynamic liquid 
level was kept  at constant level 62 in. (1.58 m) (H/D  = 10.3) from  the gas distributor by 
tuning  the initial static height of liquid loaded on the column. The experiments were 
conducted at room temperature and atmospheric pressure in churn turbulent flow regime 
(i.e., under a constant superficial gas velocity of 45 cm/s) . The superficial gas vel ocity was 
chosen to satisfy industrial interest where usually FT process operates under churn 
turbulent flow regime condition (i.e., which characterized by heterogeneous bubble's 
structure) to achieve high volumetric productivity.  This superficial gas velocity was 
calculated based on the total cross -sectional area (TCSA) of the bubble column without 
vertical internal tubes, while it was computed based on the free cross -sectional area (FCSA) 
for the flow in the case using a bubble c olumn with vertical internal tubes.  The free cross -
sectional area (FCSA) for the flow can be defined by the following equation:  
𝐹𝑟𝑒𝑒  𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 ­𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙  𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎  (𝐹𝐶𝑆𝐴 )

where Dc and Dt represent the column and tube diameters, respectively, while N represents 
the num ber of vertical internal tubes. All CT scans were conducted  in the fully developed 
region at the axial level of 0.76 m (H/D  = 5.1) where the gas holdup distribution relativel y 
does not c hange axially beyond this level.[7,21] Experiments were replicated twice to check 
for data reproducibility.  40

Gamma ray computed tomography is a noninvasive  technique that provides the

 distributions of the multiphase flow reactors  that cannot be measured by other 
measurement techniques.  
 During this study, the time -averaged gas holdup distribution measurements were 
conducted with a single -source gamma -ray computed tomography (CT) technique, which 
is the part of the current dual -source gamma -ray computed tomography that was designed  
and advanced in -house by Varma[44] and is presently available in the Multiphase Reactors 
Engineering and A pplication Laboratory (mReal) at Missouri University of Science and 
Technology (Missouri S&T). Figure 4 and Figure 5 exhibit schematically and 
photographically of the CT technique with bubbl e column equipped with a bundle  of 
vertical internals.  
 The CT technique has been successfully applied to measure the phase holdup 
distribution in different multiphase flow reactors with various scale sizes at mReal such as 
12 in. (0.3 m) pebble bed reactor[45,46], 6 in. ( 0.152  m) bubble column[9,47], 6 in. ( 0.152  m) 
and 18 in. ( 0.46 m) fluidized beds[48–51], and 3 in. (0.076 m) and  6 in. (0. 152 m) spouted 
bed reactors.[52–55] Details on the mechanical design, hardware, software, and operation of 
the CT technique have been discussed  elsewhere by Varma.[44] Therefore, the CT setup is 
shortly reviewed  here.  
The available CT scanner consists of a 250 mCi Cs-137 source (662 keV, 37 years 
half-life) and 50 mCi Co -60 (1173 and 1333 keV, 5.27 years half -life) housed in the lead 
and tungsten -shielded containers, respectively. Each gamma -ray source is facing a center 
of the arc, which consists of the 15-sodium  iodide ( NaI) scintillation detectors.  Although 
the current CT technique is composed of two gamma -ray sources (i.e., Cs -137 and Co -60), 
only the Cs -137 source was used in this investigation to visualize and quantify the gas -43 
 
 
 liquid distributions over the entire cros s-section area of the columns with and without 
vertical internals.  
 The reason for using only one gamma -ray source in this study is due to the bubble 
columns with and without vertical internals (i.e., they are stationary) involve only two -
phase (i.e., only  gas and liquid phases are moving dynamically).  However, for three -phases 
moving dynamically such as a slurry bubble column (gas -liquid -solid phases) require two 
gamma -ray sources ( Cs-137and Co -60) to image and measure gas and solid holdup 
distribution s, which is not the case in this current study . 
 Both gamma -ray sources and their array detectors are attached to a rotatable 
circular plate that has a 30 in. (0.76 m) diameter circular open space that is designed for 
the column to be scanned. This rotatable c ircular plate is connected to the square plate (base 
plate) that also has the same size of the circular hole. This base plate is connected to four 
vertical threaded rods that are joined with the upper and lower end of the aluminum 
structure of the CT setup  to allow all assembly to move up and down to scan any level 
along the column.  
 The height of the threaded rods is 120 in. (3 m), and therefore the CT technique 
can scan objects up to 108 in. (2.75 m) in height and 30 in. (0.76  m) in diameter.  Cs-137 
and Co-60 sources, as well as their detectors, are arranged and designed in a way to provide 
gamma -ray beams (fan beams) with 40° in a horizontal plane and 5 mm in height through 
collimating the sour ces by a lead collimator device, as shown in Figure 4. 
 The fan beam with the current CT technique covers columns up to 24 in. (0.6 m) 
in diameter for scanning. The detectors  for both sources  are also well collimated  with the 
lead collimator, each of which has a thin slit 2 mm in width and 5 mm in height  to obtain 44 
 
 
 narrow gamma -ray beams  and minimize the scattered gamma ray to achieve a b etter spatial 
resolution (2 mm).[56–58] During C T scans, the circular plate rotates automatically around 
the column with an angle of 1.84o degrees for each rotation (view) by using programmed 
stepping motor. Hence, the circular plate moves 197 times to complete a full CT scan  
(360o). For each rotation o f a circular plate, the array of Cs-137detectors moves 21 times 
with 0.13o for each movement through the independent programmed stepping motor.  
 This arrangement for the moving of circular plate and the array of detectors has 
designed to increase the number of protections that passed through the column to enhance 
the quality of reconstructed images. Therefore, more than 62,000 projections (i.e.,19 7 
views × 315 projections per view) of the gamma ray that passed through the column and 
recorded for image reconstruction . The recorded projections were measured  with the 
sampling rate of 60 data samples at 10 Hz. The full scan took 8.25 hours to finish.  
 The alternating minimization  algorithm (AM) was applied in this study to 
reconstruct the linear attenuation coefficient distribution  (𝜇,𝑐𝑚−1). This algorithm was 
advanced by O'Sullivan et al.[59] and successfu lly implemented by Varma et al.[60] in two 
phase systems to reconstruct the images of cross -sectional phase distributions.  
 The AM algorithm is an iterative procedure that describes the stochastic nature of 
gamma -rays which makes this algorithm preferable to others reconstruction algorithms 
such as Fourier transform (FT)[61] , back projection (BP)[62], expectation -maximization 
(EM)[60], and filtered back projection (FBP)[63]. 
 In this reconstruction algorithm, the maximum likelihood problem was remodeled 
as double minimization of I-divergence. The criteria of I -divergence was proposed by 
Csiszar[64], which represents the variation between the modeled transmission of photons by 45 
 
 
 the Beer -Lambert's law and the measured transmission of photons through the stu died 
object. This AM algorithm does not encounter any approximation (i.e., exact process) 
through minimization step as compared to expectation -maximization (EM) algorithm[60] 
and this makes AM superior to EM algorithm due to the latter involves some 
approximation . 
 All presented results in this study in terms of the linear attenuation coefficient and 
gas holdup distributions are time -averaged where the proje ctions of gamma -ray beam 
measured and recorded over a sufficiently long time (i.e., 8.25 hours  with the sampling rate 
of 60 projections at 10 Hz) and assembled to reconstruct the linear attenuation coefficient 
and the subsequently gas holdup.  
 This long time averaging for gamma -ray projections is inherently accounting for 
most fluctuations in gas holdup along any gamma -ray projection.  
According to the radiation safety rules , the CT setup was shielded  from all sides by 
lead to minimize and elimi nate the radiation dose around  the CT technique. Moreover, 
gamma -ray sources of CT were well sealed and shielded to prevent any leaks, and hence 
the CT setup is safe to be utilized in the experiments if all the operational protocols are 
followed . 
 It is no teworthy that there are protocols for operating the gamma -ray computed 
tomography (CT) technique safely, which were approached by the Environmental Health 
and Safety Department at Missouri University of Science and Technology (Missouri S&T) 
for authorized users and radiation workers.

4. PROPER ESTIMATION OF THE GAS HOLDUP DISTRIBUTION AND 
EXPERIMENTAL PROCED URES FOR SCANNING BUBBLE COLUMNS 
WITH AND WITHOUT VERTICAL INTERNALS  
4.1. ESTIMATION OF THE LOCAL GAS HOLDUP IN BUBBLE COLUMN

transmitted through a bubble column[16,58,65]:

 of medium (g/cm3), 𝜇̅: mass attenuation coefficient (cm2/g) of a material , 𝑙: path length 
through the medium (cm). The term of  𝐿𝑛(𝐼°
𝐼)  is equal to the integral sum of the measured 
attenuation that passes through the materials along the beam path  (i.e., it is a summation of 
attenuation values in all pixels along the path of the gamma -ray beam ). 
 In CT scanning, the attenuations are measured along some such beam paths 
through the bubble columns with and without vertical internal tubes from different angles.  
To obtain local att enuation measurements by CT technique, the domain of the bubble 
column first was discretized to a square matrix with a dimension of 80 by 80 pixels.  
 Hence, for a two -phase bubble column without vertical internal tubes (air -water) 
operating at any studied superficial gas velocity, the total attenuation in each pixel  (𝑖,𝑗) can 
be written as follows:  
𝐴𝑔˗𝑙,𝑖𝑗=( 𝜌𝑔𝜇̅𝑔𝑙𝑔+𝜌𝑙𝜇̅𝑙𝑙𝑙)𝑖𝑗 (4) 
where  𝑖𝑗 represents the index of pixels in the square matrix of the studied domain  
since  𝑙𝑔=𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗,𝑙𝑙=𝜀𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗,𝐿𝑖𝑗=𝑙𝑔+𝑙𝑙,and 𝜀𝑔+𝜀𝑙=1. 
 Therefore, Eq. (4) becomes  as: 
𝐴𝑔˗𝑙,𝑖𝑗=𝜌𝑔,𝑖𝑗𝜇̅𝑔,𝑖𝑗𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗+𝜌𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝜇̅𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗−𝜌𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝜇̅𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗 (5) 
where 𝐿𝑖𝑗 represents the length along which a gamma ray beam passes through this pixel  
while  𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗 𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝜀𝑙,𝑖𝑗 represent the local gas and liquid holdups in each pixel  (𝑖𝑗). In the case 
of the  scan the column is filled with water only (single phase). Therefore, the attenuation 
in each pixel can be expressed by:  
𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗=𝜌𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝜇̅𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝜀𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗=𝜌𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝜇̅𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗 ,𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝜀𝑙,𝑖𝑗=1 (6) 49 
 
 
 By substituting Eq. ( 6) into Eq. ( 5), we obtain  
𝐴𝑔˗𝑙,𝑖𝑗=𝜌𝑔,𝑖𝑗𝜇̅𝑔,𝑖𝑗𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗+𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗−𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗 (7) 
Since 𝜌𝑔,𝜇𝑔≪ 𝜌𝑙,𝜇𝑙. Hence , the attenuation caused by only gas phase (air) is 
negligible  𝜌𝑔𝜇̅𝑔𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗≅0. Then the local gas holdup can be obtained from the following 
equation.   
𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗=1−𝐴𝑔˗𝑙,𝑖𝑗
𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗 (8) 
    since                                       𝐴𝑔˗𝑙,𝑖𝑗=𝜌𝑔˗𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝜇̅𝑔˗𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗=𝜇𝑔˗𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗

𝜇𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗=1−𝜇𝑔˗𝑙,𝑖𝑗
𝜇𝑙,𝑖𝑗 (9) 
𝜀𝑙,𝑖𝑗=1−𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗 (10) 
where  𝜇𝑙,𝑖𝑗 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜇𝑔˗𝑙,𝑖𝑗 represents the linear attenuat ion coefficients for liquid and gas -
liquid in each pixel (cm-1), respectively . 
4.2. EXPERIMENTAL SCANNING PROCEDURE FOR BUBBLE COLUMN 
WITHOUT INTERNALS  
For measuring  a gas holdup distribution  over the entire cross -sectional of the bubble  
column without tubes  (two phase), the following scanning procedure ( Figure 6) was 
developed  as follows:  
➢ Scan without a column (i.e. air only) between  a gamma source and its detectors 
and consider it as reference scan  (𝐼°). 50 
 
 
 ➢ Scan a column filled with water only (𝐼𝑙) and then compute transimssion ratio 
(𝐼𝑙𝐼°⁄) for determing  𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗 .  
➢ Scan a column containing air–water operates at any studied superficial gas velocity 
(𝐼𝑔˗𝑙) and then calculate transimssion ratio (𝐼𝑔˗𝑙𝐼°⁄) for determing 𝐴𝑔˗𝑙,𝑖𝑗.  
By implementing the alternating minimization (AM) algorithm for each 
transmission ratio (𝐼𝑔˗𝑙/𝐼°) , (𝐼𝑙𝐼°⁄) independently, one can reconstruct the linear 
attenuation  coefficients (𝜇,𝑐𝑚−1) for gas-liquid 𝜇𝑔˗𝑙,𝑖𝑗 and liquid 𝜇𝑙,𝑖𝑗 , respecitively. 
Finally,  local gas and liquid holdups can be directily calculated  by applying  Eqs.( 9) and 
(10). 
4.3. ESTIMATION OF THE GAS HOLDUP IN A BUBBLE COLUMN WITH 
INTERNALS (THREE -PHASES)  
The use of the available experimental scanning procedure and mathematical 
expression for estimation of the gas holdup distribution and their profiles in a bubble 
column with vertical internal tubes can lead to incorrect estimates since they are based on 
bubble column without vertical tubes. Therefore, in this sectio n, new mathematical 
equations and experimental scanning procedure for bubble column equipped with vertical 
internal tubes are established and presented to achieve a reliable estimation of the gas 
holdup distribution and their profiles.  
 The bubble column w ith vertical tubes considers three -phases system (gas -solid -
liquid), and since the vertical of tubes are stagnant (not moving) therefore single, the 
gamma -ray source is enough to distinguish between phase. However, dual gamma -ray 
sources are required to di stinguish between three phases that are dynamically moving  as in 
the slurry bubble column.[66,67]

4.4. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE FOR SCANNING A BUBBLE COLUMN 
WITH INTERNALS  
To visualize and quantify time -averaged gas holdup distributions over the entire 
cross -sectional of a bubble column packed with vertical internals tubes , an experimental 
procedure for scanning bubble column with internals ( Figure 7) was established  and 
developed as follows:  
➢ Scan without putting a column (i.e. air only) between gamma source and its 
detectors and consider it as the reference scan (𝐼°). 
➢ Scan a column containing only water (stagnant) (𝐼𝑙) to determine 𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗. 
➢ Scan an empty column with internal only (𝐼𝑔˗𝑠) to estimate  𝐴𝑔˗𝑠,𝑖𝑗. 55 
 
 
 ➢ Scan a column with vertical  internals and filled with water (𝐼𝑙˗𝑠) to calculate  
𝐴𝑙˗𝑠,𝑖𝑗 .  
➢ Scan a column with  vertical  internals containing air–water operates at any 
selected superficial gas velocity (flowing) (𝐼𝑔˗𝑙˗𝑠) to compute  𝐴𝑔˗𝑙˗𝑠,𝑖𝑗 .  
The alternating minimization (AM) algorithm was applied to each scan 
independently to reconstruct the linear attenuation coefficients (cm-1) for liquid -solid 𝜇𝑙˗𝑠,𝑖𝑗, 
gas-liquid -solid 𝜇𝑔˗𝑙˗𝑠,𝑖𝑗, liquid 𝜇𝑙,𝑖𝑗, and gas –solid 𝜇𝑔˗𝑠,𝑖𝑗, respectively. Finally, local gas, 
solid, and liquid holdups can be directly obtained by using Eqs. ( 24), (26), and ( 27), 
respectively.  
4.5. VALIDATI ON OF CT SCANNING  
CT validation is always required to check the accuracy and performance of the CT 
technique before each study can be conducted . In this validation procedure, Plexiglas 
phantom which consists of two concentric cylinders 3 -in. (0.076 m) inner  and 6 -in (0.152  
m) outer cylinders, respectively was designed, fabricated, and scanned as illustrated in  
Figure  8. Independent scans have been performed for the phantom with different cases as 
follows:  
➢ Case  I: Empty  phantom . 
➢ Case II: Inner cylinder  of the phantom  was filled with water while the outer cylinder 
was empty ( i.e. air only).  
➢ Case III: The outer cylinder  the phantom  was filled with water while the inner 
cylinder was empty ( i.e. air only ). 
➢ Case IV: Both internal and external  cylinders were filled  with water.

 For each scan (8.25 hours), 62055 projections were detected and recorded by 15 
NaI detectors with a sampling rate of 60 data samples at a frequency of 10 Hz to reconstruct 
cross -sectional images of the linear attenuation coefficient (𝜇,𝑐𝑚−1) by using the AM 
algorithm. The resolution of reconstructed images  is presented  in this study by 80×80 
pixels, where each pixel represents an area 1.91 × 1.91 mm of the phantom or bubble 
columns. The transmission ratio and sinogram figures have been plotte d for all CT 
experiments in the beginning step of data processing (before the reconstruction step) to 
check the accuracy, and quality of collecting data, and hence they serve as diagnostic tools  
to discover the detectors defects. The y -axis of transmission  ratio figures represents the 
calculated transmission ratio for all phantom cases while the x -axis represents the angular 
location of the projection in the fan beam arrangement. All transmission ratio figures which 
shown in Figure 9 are symmetric and smooth without any detector’s artifacts. It is evident 
from these figures that CT captures the boundaries of inner and outer cylinders of the 
phantom for a ll cases.

 The sinogram figures for all phantom  cases are displayed  in Figure 9, where the y -
axis of these figures  represents projection number (315), while the x -axis represents the 
view (source position (197 )). The pixels of sinogram figures represent the transmission 
ratio for corresponding projection number and source positions. As seen from the sinogram 
figures, the CT was capable of identifying the change in the cases of the phantom, and the 
absence of ar tifacts in these figures was evidenced that detectors and t heir electronics work 
properly.  
It is evident from the reconstructed linear attenuation coefficient (𝜇,𝑐𝑚−1) images 
and their diameter profiles, which are presented in Figure 9 and Figure 10 for all cases of 
the phantom, that the CT technique was capable of retr ieving geometry  and capturing the 
wall thickness (5 mm) for inner and outer cylinders of the empty phantom when 
considering no column (i.e. air only) between gamma -ray source and its detector as the 
reference scan.  Additionally, it was capable of clearly distinguishing between water, air, 
and Plexiglas.  Moreover, the CT technique was able to distinguish between Plexiglas 
material and water as shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10d for case IV despite the convergence 
of their linear attenuation coeffi cients. Furthermore, the reconstructed linear attenuation 
coefficient values obtained by CT were very close to the theoretical values  
(𝜇𝑎𝑖𝑟=0.0001  𝑐𝑚−1,𝜇𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 =0.086  𝑐𝑚−1,𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝜇𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑥𝑖𝑔𝑙𝑎𝑠 =0.098  𝑐𝑚−1 ) with 
relative percentage difference 1.3, 2.4, and 3.2 cm-1 for air, wat er, and Plexiglas, 
respectively.[68]  
As mentioned earlier, the applied resolution for image reconstruction in this study 
is 80  × 80 pixels (where each pixel represents 1.91 × 1.91 mm of the studied domain) and 
cannot use fine pixels due to the detector's collimator size (2 mm in width). Therefore, the 59 
 
 
 wall thickness of the phantom passes through a fraction of the pixels (i.e., part of the pixel). 
For example, when reconstructing a linear attenuation coefficient for an empty phantom 
(i.e., air only), the attenuation at the wall region will be with air while when reconstructing 
for the phantom with water, the attenuation will be with w ater, and that affects the results 
of the final attenuation of that pixel. In other words, in each pixel in wall region, the 
Plexiglas wall occupies part of a certain area of the pixel, and when conducting an 
azimuthal average for the linear attenuation in  the wall region, it will count peripherally 
for all these kinds of variation that will provide such differences in the wall region of the 
phantom  (see Figure 9 and Figure 10 ). 
 These obtained results in terms of reconstructed linear attenuation coefficient 
distributions and their diametrical profiles were for the first time achieved this high 
accuracy as com pared to other previous studies[46,48,69] that are scanned the same phantom. 
Also, in these past studies were unable to reproduce the geometry of the phantom and 
capture the small t hickness of the phantom wall and this was due to using empty phantom 
as reference scan in their studies.  
 This difference between current and previous results of the reconstructed linear 
attenuation coefficient illustrates the importance of selecting a proper reference scan. 
Therefore, it should always consider air only (no column between the gamma -ray source  
and its detector) as reference scan to achieve high accuracy of reconstructed  linear 
attenuation coefficient. The obtained results of validation  procedures for the CT technique 
confirm the reliability of CT to visualize and quantify the phase distribution s in any 
multiphase reactors with high accuracy.

5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
reliable gas holdup distributions and their profiles in the bubble column with 
vertical internal tubes can be only achieved through avoiding the pitfalls outlined earlier.

 column with vertical internal tubes, building mathematical expressions for estimating gas 
holdup properly, and excluding the values of the vertical internals from the gas holdup 
distribution and their profiles.  
 In this section, the impact of using improper reference scan on the linear 
attenuation, gas holdup distributions, and their profiles in the bubble columns with and 
without vertical internal tubes was demonstrated and addressed. Moreover, a new 
methodology  for excluding the vertical internal tubes from the gas holdup distribution and 
their azimuthally averaged profiles is also developed and presented in this section.  
5.1. EFFECT OF USING DIFFERENT REFERENCE SCANS ON THE 
RECONSTRUCTED LINEAR ATTENUATION COEFFICIE NT 
DISTRIBUTIONS AND THEIR PROFILES FOR BUBBLE COLUMN 
WITHOUT INTERNALS  
Figure 11 demonstrates the reconstructed linear attenuation coefficient distributions 
for the column without vertical internal tubes filled with water (no flow) ( Figure 11a, b) 
and the column containing air –water, which ope rates at a superficial gas velocity of 45 
cm/s ( Figure 11c, d), using different reference scans [empty column and air (no column)].  
It is evident from Figure 11a and c that when the empty column was used as a 
reference scan, the reconstructed linear attenuation of water and air –water were close to 
the theoretical values for water and air (0.086, and 0.0001 cm-1), respectively, while the 
reconstructed linear attenuation for the column wall (Plexiglas) was inconsistent with the 
theoretical values (0.0988 cm-1). However, Figure 11b and d show a  close  match between  
the theoretical values of the linear attenuation coefficient for water, air, and Plexiglas when 
utilizing air (no  column) as the reference scan.  63 
 
 
  Figure 12 shows the diametrical profiles of the reconstructed linear attenuation 
coefficient based on using different reference scans [empty column, air (no column)] for 
the column filled with water (n o flow) and the column containing air -water, which operates 
at a superficial gas velocity of 45 cm/s.  
It is evident from Figure 12 that the linear attenuation coefficients for water, air, 
and Plexiglas reconstructed based on air (no column) are closer to the theoretical values 
than those calculated based on the empty col umn as the reference scan. In addition, the 
obtained results of the linear attenuation coefficient for the wall column (Plexiglas) was 
too far from the theoretical values (0.0988 cm-1) when it was reconstructed based on the 
empty column as a reference scan . 
 For example, at the dimensionless radius (r/R  = 0.23), the linear attenuation 
coefficient of water was 0.0872 cm-1 with % relative difference of 1.4% when it was 
calculated based on air (no column) as the reference scan, while it was 0.081 cm-1 with % 
relative difference of 6% when it was reconstructed based on the empty column.  
Additionally, in the wall region (r/R  = 1), which is important to quantify, the linear 
attenuation coefficient computed based on air (no column) was 0.093 cm-1 with % re lative 
difference of 5.1, while it was 0.01 cm-1 with the relative difference of  163% when it was 
calculated based on the empty column as the reference scan.  
 From above, one can notice that selecting an improper reference scan leads to 
propagating  errors  in the reconstructed linear attenuation coefficient, and consequently, in 
the gas holdup distributions and their profiles.

should be avoided during scanning bubble columns by considering air only as the reference

 5.2. EFFECT OF USING DIFFERENT REFERENCE SCANS ON THE 
RECONSTRUCTED LINEAR ATTENUATION COEFFICIENT 
DISTRIBUTIONS AND THEIR PROFILES FOR THE BUBBLE COLUMN 
WITH INTERNALS  
Linear attenuation  coefficient distributions for empty column with vertical 
internals, column with vertical internals filled with water only (no flow), and column with 
vertical internals containing air –water operating at a superficial gas velocity of 45 cm/s 
have been recon structed based on different reference scans [empty column with vertical 
internals, empty column without vertical internals, air (no column in the path between the 
source and its detectors)].  The results that demonstrate the impact of using different 
refere nce scans are presented in Figure 13. It can be recognized  from Figure 13c that the 
linear attenuation coefficient for the column filled with water only reconstructed based on 
the empty column with vertical internals as the reference scan is close to the theoretical 
value of the linear attenuation co efficient of the water. However, the obtained linear 
attenuation coefficient values for the vertical internals (made of Plexiglas material) and the 
wall of the Plexiglas column are far away from the theoretical values of Plexiglas (0.0988 
cm-1). The possible reason for that is the selection of improper reference scans (empty 
column with vertical internals), and this has been confirmed when considering empty 
column without vertical internals as the reference scan, as shown in Figure 13 (a, d, g), 
where the reconstructed linear attenuation coefficients for water, air -water, and Plexiglas 
internals were close to the theoretical values except for th e wall of the column.  However, 
considering air (no column between the Cs-137 source and its detectors) as the reference 
scan (incident counts) gives a linear attenuation coefficient for water, air, air -water, and 
Plexiglas closer to the theoretical values than those mentioned in previous cases, as shown 
in Figure 13b, e, h. By using air (no column) as a reference scan, CT can capture the wall 67 
 
 
 and the vertical internals more clearly with linear attenuation coefficient close to th e 
theoretical values.

 The radial profiles of the reconstructed linear attenuation coefficients (𝜇,𝑐𝑚−1) 
computed based on different reference scans [empty column with vertical internals, empty 
column without vertical int ernals, air (no column)] for the bubble column with vertical 
internals operating on the superficial gas velocity of 45 cm/s are shown  in Figure 14. These 
results clearly  explain that the linear attenuation coefficients reconstructed based on air (no 
column) as the reference scan are closer to the theoretical values than the others are. 
Additionally, the linear attenuation coefficients computed based  on the empty column with 
vertical internals led to inconsistent results with the theoretical values at Plexiglas internals 
zones and the column wall. For example, at the center of the column, the percentages of 
the absolute relative differences between th e theoretical and experimental linear 
attenuation coefficient values that are reconstructed based on the empty column with 
vertical internals, empty column without vertical internals, and air (no column) as reference 
scans were 92%, 16%, and 5%, respective ly. These obtained results confirm that 
considering an empty column with vertical internals as the reference scan failed to 
reconstruct the values of the linear attenuation coefficient for solid Plexiglas ( vertical 
internals and the wall of the column), bu t succeeded to reconstruct them with values close 
to theoretical values when considering no column (air) as the reference scan. Hence, using 
air as the reference scan should be considered in the process of scanning bubble columns 
with and without vertical internal tubes to achieve correct values of the linear attenuation 
coefficient and subsequently gas holdup values. The scanning the internals only (i.e., 
without the column wall) could be considered as the reference scan, but this will not affect 
the outcom es that obtained from using different reference scans because already the 
column without internals (i.e., empty) have been considered as reference scan.  69

SECTIONAL GAS HOLDUP DISTRIBUTION S FOR THE BUBBLE 
COLUMN S WITH AND WITHOUT INTERNAL S 
Figure 15 shows the time -averaged cross -sectional gas holdup distribution 
measured in the fully developed flow region at axial level 0.76 m (H/D  = 5.1) for the bubble 
column without vertical internals operated at a superficial gas velocity of 45 cm/s. 
Qualitatively, the gas holdup distribution calculated based on the empty column as the 
reference scan shows more gas in the core of the column and extends more to the wall 
region than th at calculated based on air (no column).  
 This variation in the local gas holdup distributions is due to using different 
reference scans, which produced different linear attenuation values and subsequently gas 00.020.040.060.080.10.12

 holdup values because of the estimation of the gas holdup depends mainly on the 
reconstructed linear attenuation coefficients.  
 Interestingly, the positions of the vertical internals were clearly distinguished from 
gas-liquid distribution when the air (no column) was considered as a reference scan, and  
when the new experimental scanning procedure was applied, and when the new 
mathematical relationships for the estimation gas holdup in the bubble column with vertical 
internals were implemented, as shown in Figure 16b. 
 However, this is not the case in gas holdup distribution calculated based on the 
empty column with vertical internal tubes as the reference scan, when applying an old 
experimental scanning procedure, or when implementing old mathematical expressions for 
the estimation of gas holdup ( Figure 16a).

5.4. EFFE CT OF USING DIFFERENT REFERENCE SCANS, NEW 
EXPERIMENTAL SCANNING PROCEDURE, AND NEW 
MATHEMATICAL EQUATIONS ON THE G AS HOLDUP PROFILES FOR 
BUBBLE COLUMN S WITH AND WITHOUT INTERNALS  
Figure 17 displays the azimuthally and time -averaged gas holdup  profiles in the 
bubble column without vertical internals operating at a superficial gas velocity of 45 cm/s  
for different reference scans  [empty column without vertical internals, and air (no 
column)]. It is evident  from the profiles that gas holdup calculated based on the empty 
column is higher than that based on air (no column) as a reference scan at the core and wall 
regions of the colum n. For instance, the absolute differences are 5.5% and 6.9% at the 
center  (r/R = 0.038) and wall (r/R  = 0.9) regions of the column, respectively. This 
difference between gas holdup profiles due to using different reconstructed linear 
attenuation coefficien ts, which are calculated based on different reference scans.  It is 
important to mention that the measurements of the gas holdup obtained by CT technique 
in the bubble column without vertical internals operated at a superficial gas velocity of 45

 cm/s were validated by using a four -point optical fiber probe as an independent technique 
to check the accuracy and the reproducibility of the CT data. This optical probe technique 
is currently available in our laboratory (mReal) and has been successfully used to me asure 
the local gas holdup and bubble properties (bubble passage frequency, bubble chord 
lengths, specific interfacial area, and bubble rise velocity) in different types of multiphase 
reactors. More details about the four -point optical fiber probe techniqu e can be found 
elsewhere .[8,24,43] The verification process included repeating the operation of the bubble 
column withou t vertical internals under the same operating conditions (i.e., maintaining 
the same dynamic level and superficial gas velocity,  45 cm/s) with CT scan and measuring 
the local gas holdup at the same axial level of CT scan. Figure 18 illustrates the comparison 
between local gas holdup profiles obtained by CT and optical probe under the same 
operating condition (i.e., under a superficial gas velocity of 45 cm/s). The analysis of 
comparison for the local gas holdup values obtained by CT and optical probe techniques 
reveals that both techniques produce convergent gas holdup values. For example, the 
average absolute relative difference between the profiles is 7 .3%, which confirms the 
accuracy and reproducibility of CT data.  The radial profiles of azimuthally and time -
averaged gas holdup  for the bubble column with vertical internals operating at a superficial 
gas velocity of 45 cm/s for different reference scans [empty column with vertical internals, 
empty column without vertical internals, and no column (air)] are presented  in Figure 19. 
These gas holdup radial profiles that displayed in Figure 19 were calculated by performing 
azimuthally average for the images of the gas holdup ( Figure 16) without excluding the 
values of vertical internals  (i.e., solid internals are present).  It is apparent from the figure 
that gas holdup profiles calculated based on the empty column without v ertical internals 73 
 
 
 and no column (i.e., air only) are close to each other. However, the gas holdup profiles 
computed based on the empty column with vertical internals as a reference scan displays a 
different trend from others, particularly at the positions of the vertical internals, due to the 
selection  of an improper reference scan (empty column with vertical internals). For 
example, the value of gas holdup at the core region (r/R  = 0.04) is 0.52 based on an empty 
column with vertical internals as the reference scan, while it is 0.05 for gas holdup 
calculated based on empty column and no column (air only) as reference scans with a 
relative  percentage difference of 159%. This indicates  that using the column with vertical 
internals as the reference scan, the old experimental scanning procedure (consider as 
scanning bubble column without vertical internal), and the old mathematical relationship 
for calculating gas holdup (consider as colu mn without vertical internals) led to a 
significant error in the calculation of the gas holdup in the bubble column with vertical 
internals. Therefore, there is a need to exclude the vertical internals from the gas holdup 
distributions and the azimuthally averaging to reflect the actual and reliable gas holdup 
values.  Unlike the obtained gas holdup profile in the bubble column without vertical 
internals, the gas holdup profile obtained in the bubble column with vertical internals was 
a wavy -like shape due t o the presence of these vertical internals. Performing azimuthally 
(i.e., circumferentially average along the pixels of the image) averaging to the gas holdup 
distribution image to produce the radial profile in the presence of the vertical internals 
causes  a significant error if those vertical internal tubes are not excluded from this 
averaging. The method of excluding the vertical internals from gas holdup distributions 
and their profiles will be explained in the next section.  74

5.5. NEW METHODOLOGY FOR EXCLUDING THE VERTICAL  INTERNALS 
FROM THE GAS HOLDUP DISTRIBUTION IMAGES AND THEIR 
AZIMUTHAL AVERAGE PROFILES  
Counting the values of the vertical internals in the calculation of the azimuthally 
averaging gas holdup profiles leads to propagating error if the same algorithms and 
programs in such calculations for columns without vertical internals are used for the 
column with vertical internals. Hence, there is a need to introduce a  new algorithm or 
method to exclude the values of the vertical internals from the azimuthal averaging for 
these columns to achieve a reliable  estimation of the radial profiles of the gas ho ldup. The 
values of the local gas holdup in the zones of the vertical internals should be zero, but 
according to Figure 16a, they are not zero (noise) at all. Hence, there is a need to precisely 
define the position of each of the vertical internals to exclude them from the azimuthal 
average of the gas holdup profiles. However, the cross -sectional image of the gas holdup 00.20.40.60.81

 (Figure 16a) is very blurry as a result of using an improper reference scan (empty column 
with vertical internals), and the positions of the vertical internals ca nnot even be visually 
identified. Hence, the original configuration of the vertical internals ( Figure 3) and the 
reconstructed linear attenuation coeff icient image have been used  ( Figure 13h) to 
determine the exact locations of the vertical internals by applying the below procedure:  
➢ Determining the center and boundaries of the column through the binarization process 
(converting a  pixel image to a binary image)[70,71] of the reconstructed linear attenua tion 
coefficient, as displayed in Figure 20. The center of the column is calculated by  Eq. 35 and 
36: 
𝑥𝑐=∑ 𝑋𝑖𝑗 (𝑖,𝑗)∈𝑅
𝐴 (35) 
𝑦𝑐=∑ 𝑦𝑖𝑗 (𝑖,𝑗)∈𝑅

b) Reconstructed linear attenuation

 ➢ Defining the real position for each of the vertical internals in the gas holdup distribution 
image. Unfortunately for the low -resolution bitmap picture, even for the same circle of the 
vertical internals’ arrangement, different centers show different shape s, as can be seen in 
Figure 21. Also, the vertical internals’ circles should have the same size. Therefore, the 
actual dimensions of the configuration  of the vertical internals (circular arrangement) were 
used ( Figure 22a) to obtain an image for it and to impose this image on a reconstructed 
linear attenuation coefficient image ( Figure 22b). However, the position of the vertical 
internals for the real image (configuration) does not match the reco nstructed linear 
attenuation coefficient image. Therefore, in this work, a template matching technique has 
been used to identify an optimum radius and angles for the rotation, as shown in Figure 23. 
Additionally,  the subpixel position accuracy was implemented to find the precise center of  
each of the vertical internals. [72] However, this template matching method is not univ ersal 
and it has been applied case by case according to the vertical internals configurations and 
their sizes.

➢ Deleting the noise (vertical internals zones), once the linear attenuation coefficient and 
real configuration images match. It is worth mentioning that this approach of exclusion of 
the vertical internals from gas holdup distribution images was implemented  with different 
sizes of the vertical internals (0.5 in. and 1 in. diameter) and different configurations of 
vertical internals (circular and hexagonal shape), where it worked efficiently, as shown in 
Figure 24, Figure 25, and Figure 26.

 ➢ Computation of the azimuthally averaged gas holdup profiles. This step is considered 
the most important step in the calculation of the azimuthally averaged gas holdup beacuase 
all simulation results and hydrodynamic models will be compared against and vali dated 
with experimental gas holdup profiles, and hence if the experimental azimuthally averaged 
gas holdup profiles, measured were wrong, then the validation process will be incorrect. 
Therefore, we excluded the values of the vertical internals from the av eraging values of 
gas holdup to provide accurate and reliable gas holdup profiles. Once the vertical internal 
positions are excluded from the gas holdup distribution image, the azimuthally averaged 
gas holdup profiles can be easily computed, as shown in Figure 27, to produce an 
azimuthally averaged radial profile. Figure 28 displays the comparison between gas holdup 
profiles before and after excluding the internals. According to the Figure 28, the gas holdup 
profile after excluding the internals starts from the region at the dimensionless radius, r/R= 
0.17 because before this region, there was  an internal that was located at the center of the 
column. Additionally, there is a gap between the gas hold up profiles in the confined area 
by the dimensionless radius, r/R  = 0.41, and r/R  = 0.75, which represents the positions of 
internals. For example, the relative percentage difference between profiles is  59% at the 
dimensionless radius, r/R  = 0.56. This difference in the gas holdup profiles results from 
excluding the internals from azimuthally averaged of gas holdup profile, and the obtained 
gas holdup in this region represents the azimuthally averaged of gas holdup values between 
the internals.  These rad ial profiles of the gas holdup ( Figure 28) were further processed to 
present them in the diametrical profiles, as exhibited in Figure 29. Furthermore, the 
diametrical gas holdup profiles obtained by CT technique for bubble column with vertical 
internals were compared with those obtained by other indep endent measurements using 81 
 
 
 four-point optical fiber probe. In this comparison, the local gas holdup values were 
measured in the same experimental setup (i.e., 6 -inch bubble column with vertical 
internals) and under the same conditions (i.e., under a superfi cial gas velocity of 45 cm/s). 
The values of gas holdup along the diameter obtained by the optical probe were compared 
with local values of the gas holdup at the corresponding pixel locations of the CT image, 
as displayed in Figure 30. It is evident from this figure that the values of gas holdup 
obtained with CT and optical probe are close to each other with an average absolute relative 
difference of 6.2%, which confirms t he fidelity of the CT measurements for bubble column 
with vertical internals.  Finally, Figure 31 illustrates all steps of the methodology for 
excluding the internals from gas holdup distributions and their profiles.

 6. REMARKS  
The present work was performed to identify and address some major pitfalls in 
conducting and interpreting the results of the gamma ray computed tomography technique 
for the bubble column with vertical internal tubes to provide correct and reliable  gas holdup 
distributions and their profiles at any operating condition. In this study, various pitfalls 
were identified, such as using an improper reference scan, attempting to estimate gas 
holdup distribution  and their profiles in bubble column with vertical internals from the 
experimental scanning procedure and mathematical relationships used to determine gas 
holdup in bubble column without vertical internals, and failure to calculate the azimuthally 
gas hold up profile in the presence of the vertical internal tubes. This investigation was 
conducted in a 6 in. Plexiglas bubble column in the presence and absence of the vertical 
internals for the air –water system at a superficial gas velocity of 45 cm/s by utiliz ing an 
advanced gamma ray computed tomography (CT) technique. The key results are 
summarized as follows:  
➢ A new experimental scanning procedure, mathematical equations for the estimation of 
gas holdup, and methodology of excluding the vertical internal tube s have been 
implemented to correctly and precisely visualize and quantify the gas holdup 
distribution and their profiles in the bubble column with vertical internals.  
➢ Experimental results revealed that the reference scan significantly affects the values of  
the reconstructed linear attenuation coefficient and consequently the gas holdup results.  
➢ The reconstructed linear attenuation coefficient values are compared with theoretical 
values and show good agreement when considering the empty column (without verti cal 
internals) and air only (without putting column between the gamma -ray source and its 85 
 
 
 detectors) as reference scans, while showing disagreement when using the empty 
column with vertical internals as reference scan.  
➢ Using air only (without column) as a reference scan has eliminated the error in gas 
holdup profiles at the wall region.  
➢ The gamma ray computed tomography technique was capable of capturing the wall 
thickness of the column and the vertical internals when air only (without column) was 
used as a  reference scan.  
➢ The new experimental scanning procedure and method of excluding the vertical 
internals from the cross -sectional gas holdup distributions and their radial profiles have 
been successfully implemented  with different sizes (0.5 and 1-inch diameters) of the 
vertical internals and different  configuration of the vertical internals (circular and 
hexagonal shape).  
➢ Identifying and addressing some issues and concerns that are associated with measuring 
gas holdup distributions and their profiles i n the bubble columns with vertical internal 
tubes by using the CT technique will assist and guide those scanning bubble column 
with the vertical internals to avoid these pitfalls and provide reliable results for the gas 
holdup.  
➢ Despite the presented experi mental procedure, relationships for calculating gas holdup, 
and method of excluding the internals from gas holdup distribution and its profile were 
applied successfully based on a case by case for different sizes and configurations of 
vertical internals in  this study. However, further algorithm development is required in 
the future to make this algorithm robust for any kinds of vertical internals.  86

ABSTRACT  
The effect s of the presence  of the vertical internals  of different sizes  at a wide  range  
of superficial gas velocity  on the overall, local gas holdup distributions and their profiles 
have been studied  and quantified in a 6 -inch (0.14 m) Plexiglas® bubble column with air-
water system using a non -invasive advanced gamma -ray computed tomography (CT) 
technique.  In this study, two sizes of Plexiglas® vertical  internals, having the same 
occupying area ( ~25%) of the column's cross -sectional area (CSA) that represents those 
used in Fischer -Tropsch syn thesis, have been used within a range of superficial gas 
velocities  that cover bubbly and churn turbulent flow regimes  (0.05 to 0.45 m/s) . The 
reconstructed CT scan images reveal ed that the bubble columns equipped with or without  
internals display ed a uniform cross -sectional gas holdup  distribution (symmetric) for all 
studied superficial gas velocit ies. However, the bubble column equipped with 1 -inch 
vertical internals exhibited more uniform  gas holdup  distribution than the column  with 0.5 -
inch internals.  Also, the visualization of the gas -liquid distributions for bubble columns 
with and without internals reveal that the well -known phenomenon of the core -annular 
liquid circulation pattern  that observed in the bubble column without internals still exists 
in bubble column packed densely with vertical internals.  Moreover , a remarkable increase 
in the gas holdup  values at  the wall region was achiev ed in the  churn turbulent flow regime 92 
 
 
 based on  the insertion  of the vertical internals  inside  the column as compared with using a 
bubble column without obstacles. Furthermore, the values of the gas holdup in the core 
region of the bubble  column with  vertical  internals are similar to those of  the bubble 
column with out vertical  internals when they are operate d at high superficial gas veloci ty 
(churn turbulent flow regime ), based on the free cross -sectional area  (CSA)  for the flow. 
In general , the magnitude of the gas holdup increase d significantly with increasing 
superficial gas velocity for  the bubble column s with and without internals. However, the 
gas holdup  profile  was shaped like a wavy line  in the bubble column with  vertical  internals , 
whereas it exhibited a parabolic gas holdup  profile in the bubble column without obstacles.  
Keywords:  Bubble column, internals size, gas holdup  distribution,  computed  tomography

1. INTRODUCTION  
Bubble and slurry bubble column reactors  have several features that make them 
widely used in the industry such as chemical and biochemical, petroleum and 
petrochemical, and metallurgical processes  [1–5]. Among these characteristics, they offer 
high heat and mass transfer rates, sufficient heat recovery by equipping them with a bundle 
of the heat exchanging tubes, invariant overall catalyst activity, an absence of moving parts 
and hence they are suitable fo r high -pressure operating conditions, and with their simple 
design and construction they save time and cost during construction, operation, and 
maintenance processes  [6–10]. The main disadvantages of bubble/slurry bubble columns 93 
 
 
 are significant phase -back mixing and challenges for design and scale -up due to the 
complex interaction that exists between the gas -liquid or gas -solid -liquid (gas -slurry) 
phases, which affect s the int erface forces such as the drag force, lift force, turbulent 
dispersion force, and others  [11]. 
Many of the chemical reactions conducted in bubble/slurry bubble columns are 
involving highly exothermic reactions such as acetic acid industry , acetone production,  
Fischer -Tropsch (FT) synthesis, and many others  that require inserting a large number of 
vertical cooling tubes inside these reactors to absorb the excess heat generated and to 
maintain the desired temperature for the reaction to prevent local overheating of catalyst, 
decreas e selectivity for desired products, and runaway of these reactors  [12–17]. Equipping 
these reactors with a bundle of the heat exchanging tubes will impact the hydrodynamics 
and consequently the performance, productivity, and selectivity of these  reactors  [18]. 
Among these hydrodynamic factors, gas holdup distribution is considered one of 
the most important hydrodynamic parameter s because it governs the liquid/slurry flow 
pattern, mixing, gas -liquid interfacial area and as a result the heat transfer rate from the 
heat exchange tubes of the gas -liquid or gas -slurry phases and the mass transfer rate 
between the phases  [19–21]. Therefore, the efficient design, scale -up, operating, 
monitoring, and optimization of bubble/slurry bubble columns equipped with a bundle of 
the heat exchanging tubes requires the knowledge of gas holdup d istributions and their 
profiles, which are lacking in the open literature.  
In the past few decades, an extensive experimental and simulation studies have been 
performed  on the hydrodynamics of the bubble/slurry bubble columns without internals  
[22–33]. However, very limited  studies have considered the effect of the presence of the 94 
 
 
 vertical internals on the hydrodynamics of these reactors despite the fact that an intense  
vertical bundle of the heat exchanging tubes is equipped inside industrial bubble/slurry 
bubble columns to maintain the temperature of the reaction. Some of t hese experimental 
investigations and their key findings on bubble/slurry bubble columns equipped with 
vertical tubes are summarized  in Table 1. 
According to Table 1, noteworthy experimental studies that led to advance the 
understanding of the hydrodynamics and the bubble properties of the bubble/slurry bubble 
columns equipped with vertical internals  [11,15,34 –45]. Unfortunately, most of these 
investigations were carried out using visual observation or probe -based experimental 
techniques  [34,37,39,41,43,44,46,4 7]. It is not usually feasible to make m easurements 
based on visual observation s because of  the opaque  nature of the flow pattern in a bubble 
column with internals [48]. Also, probe -based techniques are invasive, and even if they are 
reliable, but  still they are providing point measurements that require extensive 
experimental work to address the effects of the operating and design parameters . 
Additionally, these probe techniques have access issues for all the cross -sectional area of 
the column during the measurements, especially  with columns equipped with dense solid 
vertical internals due to there is not enough room  to insert the probes.  Moreover, the 
measured gas holdup  profiles by these probes -based techniques cannot  capture the non -
symmetry of the measured parameters across the cross -sectional area of the bubble column 
since the flow behavior inside the bubble column s is turbulent and chaotic, especially in 
high superficial gas velocity (churn turbulent flow regime)  [49,50] . Therefore, it was 
difficul t to capture the maldistribution using these point measurement techniques. 95 
 
 
 Furthermore, the dimensions of the probe can affect the hydrodynamic data of the fluid 
being measured , as reported by Ellis et al. [51]. 
Recently, Whitemarsh et al. [52] studied the influence of the presence of a probe 
on the local gas holdup in a fluidized bed and concluded that there are significant variations 
in the gas holdup  data at the probe tips and even in the flow above the inserted probe. 
Therefore, there is a ne ed to use non -invasive techniques, such as gamma ray or x -ray 
computed tomography that can provide reliable phase holdups distribution data over the 
entire  cross -sectional area of the bubble column in the presence and absence of the vertical 
internals  without disturbing the flow pattern.  
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there are  no more than two published studies 
in the literature that have investigated the influence of the vertical internals on the time -
averaged gas holdup  distribution s and their r adial profiles by using gamma -ray computed 
tomography as a non -invasive technique. One such study performed by Chen et al. [38], 
measured in the fully developed region (132 cm  above the gas distributor ) the time and 
azimuthal averaged of the gas holdup  profiles  at the superficial gas velocities of 2, 5, and 
10 cm/s in an 18 -inch (44 cm) diameter bubble column without and with internals 
(occupying 5% of t he total cross -sectional area (CSA)  of the column ) for both air -water 
and air -drake oil systems.  They reported that in the fully developed region of the bubble 
column with or without internals for both systems, the gas holdup and the liquid 
recirculation f low pattern were axisymmetric. Also, they found that the gas holdup  was 
higher in the air -water system as compared with the air -drake oil system for the same 
studied superficial gas velocities  based on the total cross -sectional area of the column . 
However, their study was carried out at a low superficial gas velocity (up 10 cm/s), while 96 
 
 
 the industrial processes are interested in high volumetric productivity, which can only be 
achieved  with high superficial gas velocity (typically in churn turbulent  flow regime)  
[53,54] . Moreover, they utilized a vertical rod s bundle that covered a little blocked cross -
sectional  area of the column (5 percent of the total cross -sectional area  (CSA) of the column 
that targets methanol synthesis), which does not meet the requirement of FT synthesis to 
remove the generated heat. Furthermore, the reported slight increase in the gas holdup 
based on the insertion of the vertical rods may be the result of using the same superficial 
gas velocity, which is calculated based on the total CSA of the bubble columns without 
internals. Hence, the gas velocity through the gaps between the tubes is  higher than that in 
the case of the bubble column without internals.  
The other study that investigated the impact of the vertical internals on the gas 
holdup distribution s and their profiles was publish ed recently by Al -Mesfer et al. [45]. In 
this work, the time-averaged cross -sectional gas holdup  distribution s and their radial 
profiles in bubble columns for an air -water system with a  broad  range of superficial gas 
velocities fro m 5-45 cm/s were measured  by using gamma -ray computed tomography 
(CT). They used a bundle of the  vertical  internals (tubes) of 0.5 -inch (1.27 cm) diameter 
that arranged non -uniformly in a hexagonal configuration with wall clearance. These tubes 
were design ed to cover about 25% of the CSA of the column, similar to those employed in 
FT synthesis. Their experimental results showed that the overall and local gas holdups were 
similar in both columns without or with internals when the superficial gas velocities w ere 
calculated based on the free CSA for the flow inside the column while higher overall and 
local gas holdups obtained in the column equipped with internals and this column operated 
at a superficial gas velocity computed based on the total cross -sectional  area CSA of the 97 
 
 
 column.  In this case, the same volumetric flow was flowing through a smaller cross -
sectional area of the gaps between the internals as compared with what occurs in the 
column without internals. They also stated that the time -averaged cross -sectional gas 
holdup distributions were symmetric (uniform) for the bubble column without internals for 
all studied superficial gas velocities, whereas bubble column packed with dense vertical 
internals based on the configuration used exhibited a sym metric  (uniform distribution)  gas 
holdup distribution at low superficial gas velocities and an asymmetric (non -uniform 
distribution) at high superficial gas velocities.  Furthermore, they reported that the total and 
local gas holdup profiles for a bubble co lumn without internals can be extrapolated to 
determine the gas holdup profile in a bubble column with internals, if the superficial gas 
velocities are computed based on the free CSA available for the flow of the phases provided 
that the symmetric cross -sectional gas holdup distributions and geometrical similarity be 
achieved.  However, this study was limited to one size of rods (0.5 -inch diameter) and these 
rods were inserted  inside the bubble column in a hexagonal configuration with uneven 
clearances betwe en the wall of the column and the bundle of vertical rods.  
Thus, due to lack of knowledge of the gas holdup distributions in bubble column 
with internals this work focus on  quantify ing the influence of the presence of the vertical 
internals  with different  sizes on the time -averaged cross -sectional gas holdup distribution 
and their profi les at a range of superficial gas velocity that covers the bubbly and churn 
turbulent flow regimes using  advanced  gamma -ray computed tomography (CT) technique.  
The experiment al results and finding of this work along with previous studies on 
the subject  will significantly enhance and enrich the fundamental understanding of the 
influence of the presence of dense and sparse vertical internals as well as their diameter on 98 
 
 
 the gas-liquid distribution in a bubble column equipped with a bundle of the heat 
exchanging tubes (internals). Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation studies for 
bubble columns with vertical internals [55–59] are still limited  in the literature due to these 
bubble columns with vertical internals involv ing a very complex interaction among phase 
and due to the lack of experi mental data for CFD validation . Therefore , this study will 
provide benchmark data not only for future exper imental investigations in this field, but 
also for evaluation, tuning, and validation of a three -dimensional (3 D) computational fluid 
dynamics (CFD) simulations and hydrodynamics models for a bubble column equipped 
with a bundle of the vertical internals. This assessment and validation process of  the CFD 
simulation s are much needed  due to the turbulent models, and the closures of interfacial 
forces that use in these simulations are based  on empirical correlations. Once CFD 
simulations of bubble columns equi pped with vertical internals for air -water system at 
different superficial gas velocit ies are validated, then one can use the validated CFD to 
assess industrial related conditions and  to conduct sensitivity analysis with various input 
feed, different operating conditions, different  configurations of vertical internals, and with 
different sizes of reactors .  
Thus  this will facilitate the design and scale up of these types  of reactors.  It is 
noteworthy that air -water system has been selected in this work to have the base of 
comparison with the bulk of the work in the literature, which used air -water system. The 
development of the 3D CFD simulations of the bubble columns packed with vertic al 
internals is currently in progress in our Laboratory and will be reported  in subsequent 
publications.

 2. EXPERIMENTAL WORK  
2.1. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP  
A Plexiglas®  bubble column with an inner diameter of 5.5 -inches (0.14 m) and a 
height of 72 -inches (1.83 m) using  an air-water system  has been employ ed in this study,  as 
displayed schematically in  Figure 1. In this work, the air (gas phase) was supplied  from an 
oil-free industrial compressor (Ingersoll Rand Company). The air  was passed through 
filters and introduced  to pre -calibrated flow meters . The gas flow rate was regulated and 
measured using a pressure regulator and two calibrated flow meters  (Brooks Instrument) 
with a different scale where they  are connected  in parallel to cover the wide range of 
selected superficial gas velocities (0 .05-0.45 m/s), particularly  bubbl y and churn turbulent 
flow regime s. The air was continuously introduced  from  the bottom of the column through 
the plenum and stainless steel perforated plate distributor , with 121 holes of 1.32 mm 
diameter, arranged in a triangular pitch, with the total free area of 1.09% , as shown in  
Figure 2. 
Purified water provided  by a reverse osmosis water filtration system was used for 
the liquid phase , in batch mode , for all experiments.  As mentioned earlier, the  reasons for 
the selecting air-water system in this present study owes to its simplicity in the 
experimental work  and the abundance of previous experimental works of this system for 
bubble column  with and  without vertical internals that will be facilitated  the comparison 
with obtaining results. Besides those reasons, the most important one was to complement 
Kagumba  [60], Kagumba and Al -Dahhan [44] and Jasim  [61] studies, which were included 
measuring the bubble properties (specific interfacial area, axial bubble velocity, bubble 105 
 
 
 passage frequency, and bubble chord lengths) in the same system by using a 4 -point fiber 
optical pr obe technique.   
In the present work, the dynamic  level of the bed was maintained  at 62 -inches (1.6 
m) (L/D  = 10.3)  above the gas distributor by changing the initial static liquid level in 
accordance  with the operating superficial gas velocity. An adhesive measuring tape was 
attached to the column to monitor  both the static liquid and dynamic  level s during the 
experiments. It is important to note that the dynamic  level was adjusted  by adding water 
during the run due to water loss caused by evaporat ion, especially at high superficial gas 
velocities , as the result of humidification and the long duration  of the experiment for each 
CT scan.  
In this investigation , two sizes  of the vertical  internals  were  used: 0.5-inch (0.0127 
m) and 1 -inch (0.0254 m) diameter  Plexiglas®  tubes.  These tubes were  arranged  vertically 
and uniformly distributed inside the bubble col umn in a circular configuration, as  shown 
in Figure 3. The 0.5 -inch internals were organiz ed in three bundles that were positioned  at 
three dimension less radial positions, r/R  (0.8, 0.5, and 0. 2), while the 1 -inch internals were 
arranged  in one bundle that was located  at r/R  = 0.65, with one tube at the center of the 
column. In each case, these  bundles of  the vertical  internals  were designed to cover 
approximately  25% of the  total cross -sectional area of the column to represent  the bundle 
of heat exchang ing tubes that used in FT synthesis to remove the heat generated by its 
exothermic reaction.  The internals were  inserted and secured vertically in the column 
starting with a 3-inch clearance from the  gas distributor and extending up to the top of the 
column by using three circular spacers/supports as well as the top plate to eliminate the 
vibration and make the vertical internals more  stable , as seen in Figure 3. 106

 As mentioned earlier, the cooling tubes used in the FT synthesis are dense which 
covers 25% of the cross -sectional area of the column. Therefore, to establish dense internal 
tubes which represent FT synthesis, 0.5 - inch vertical inter nals were used for the 6 -inch 
column diameter. Additionally, to study the effect of internals size while keeping the same 
covering cross -sectional area and the same configuration of vertical internals, the 1 -inch 
vertical internals were chosen where the nu mber of tubes will be noticeably lower which 
gives rise to larger gaps between the vertical internals to demonstrate such effect.  The 
bubble columns with or without vertical  internals were well -balanced and centered in the 
middle of the gamma -ray computed tomography (CT) scanner, as seen in Figure 4. In 
addition , vertical and horizontal alignments were made for bubble columns to make sure 
the column was balanced. Furthermore, the bubble column was supported at the bottom 
and top by a rig id aluminum structure with a rubber piece to prevent any mechanical 
vibration during the operation that could affect the gas holdup  measurements [62,63] . All 
experiments were carried out at room temperature  and atmospheric pressure over a wide 
range of superficial gas velocities (0.05 -0.45 m/s) based on the total CSA for the bubble 
column without vertical internals, while based on the free CSA for the flow in the case of 
the bubble column equipped with vertical internals. The free CSA for the flow is equal to :  
(𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 ˗𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙  𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎  𝑜𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑏𝑢𝑏𝑏𝑙𝑒  𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑛  𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙  𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑠 )
−(𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 ˗𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙  𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎  𝑜𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑝𝑖𝑒𝑑  𝑏𝑦 𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙  𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑠 ) 
The studied superficial gas velocities (5, 20, and 45 cm/s) were selected to have a 
velocity of 5 cm/s within the bubbly flow region  [64], early churn turbulent of 20 cm/s, 
and deep in churn turbulent flow regime of 45 cm/s. The bubble column s with or without  
vertical  internals were  scanned  in the fully developed region  (L/D  =5.1 above the gas 109 
 
 
 distributor ). This axial level of the scan was chosen  because  the experimental results 
show ed that the gas holdup profile remain ed relatively unchanged  in this region  [65]. Each 
CT scan was replicated twice to check for the reproducibility . 
2.2. GAMMA -RAY  COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) TECHNIQUE  
Our d ual-source/energy  gamma -ray computed tomography (DSCT) is an advanced 
non-invasive technique that provides  qualitative and quantitative  information about the 
time-averaged cross -sectional  three  phase distributions along the height of the reactor 
column when  three phases that are dynamically moving [66]. However, for  two-phase  flow 
systems,  a single  source has been used.  
At  our laboratory (Multiphase Reactors Engineering and Application Laboratory, 
mReal) a single -source  (Cs-137 (662 KeV) ) gamma -ray computed tomography (CT) 
technique , which is part of the dual -source computed tomography (DSCT) , was 
successfully u sed to measure the cross -sectional phase distributions and their radial profiles 
in a two-phase flow bubble column [45], pebble bed  [67], fluidized bed  [68–70], and 
spouted bed [71,72]  at different operat ing conditions . The DSCT technique consists of two 
encapsulated sources , with initial activity ~ 250 mCi Cs -137 (half -life of about 37 years)  
and ~ 50 mCi Co -60 (half -life of about 5.24 years) , which  are well sealed  and housed inside  
lead-shielded  and tungsten, respectively  containers as seen in  Figure 4. In the present 
investigation, a single gamma -ray source (Cs -137) was used to investigate the time-
averaged cross -sectional gas holdup distributions and their diameter profiles in  the studied 
bubble column s with and without  vertical  internals. An a rch created by 15  sodium  iodide 
(NaI) scintillation detectors ( 2-inches ( 5 cm ) in diameter) was posit ioned  in front of each 
gamma -ray source  as displayed in Figure 5. Both sources were  collimated to provide a fan 110 
 
 
 beam with 40° in the horizontal plane and 5 mm height in the vertical plane.  The detectors 
are also collimated  with a lead collimator that has a n open slit of dimension 2 mm × 5 mm  
to make sure lines (beams) pass ed through the detector’s aperture and were recorded by 
the detectors . The collimator designs for both the gamma -ray sources and detectors were 
selected  to acquire the highest number of counts with the minimum  scattering effects  [49]. 
 
Figure 4: Dual source gamma ray computed tomography (CT) technique with a bubble 
column with internals  
 
Together , the source and the detectors were  placed  on the rotatable , circular plate 
that was attached  to the fixed square (base) plate  by a circular rack and pinion . Both circular 
and square plates had 30-inch (0.762 m) circular open space , which designates to the 
reactor column being scanned . The square plate was connected  to four threaded vertical 
rods that were joined  at the top and bottom of the aluminum structure for the  CT technique. 
On the lower part of e ach screwed rod , a pinion was located . These four pinions were  linked

 by a chain  to the electric gear motor. When  the electric motor is operate d, the chain move s 
and rotate s the threaded rods , which in turn move s the square plate upward or downward 
to allow the column to be scanned  at different axial levels.  
 
Figure 5: Schematic diagram of the Cs -137 source and configuration of the detectors  
 
During CT scanning, the circular plate rotate d around the studied column with a 
small angle ( approximately  1.83°) per each rotation (view) by using the precise stepper 
motor. For each step on a rotating basis ( one view), the array of detectors moved  by using 
another stepper motor, with  21 steps and an angle of 0.13 °, producing  315 detector 
positions (projections).  Therefore, for full CT scans, there were  197 source positions 
(views) and 315 (21  × 15) projections. Hence , 62,055 (197 views × 315 proje ctions) 
projection s passed through the scanned object  were  recorded and used to calculate the 
transmission ratios, construct the sinograms, linear attenuation coefficient  (μ, cm-1) 
distribution, and gas holdup  distribution images for the bubble columns wit h or without

 vertical  internals . In this study, the sampling rate for acquiring accounts was chosen to be  
60 samples at 10 Hz, which took about 8.25 hour s for a complete  scan to achieve good 
statistics for the time-averaged gas holdup  distributions.   
Different scans for bubble column s with or without vertical  internals , including 
empty columns,  the column  filled with water only, and the column under selected operating 
conditions (i.e., at the studied superficial gas velocity)  were  performed independently to 
obtain  the cross -sectional distribution of the linear attenuation coefficients ( μ, cm-1) by 
applying alternating minimization (A M) algorithm, which was developed by O'Sullivan et 
al. [73] and implemented by V arma [66]. The AM algorithm is an iterative procedure that 
models the stochastic nature of gamma -rays and which  uses the idea of the I-divergence 
introduced by Csiszar  [74] to obtain a maximum -likelihood estimate. I -divergence 
represents the difference between the modeled transmission of photons by the Beer -
Lambert's law and the measured transmission of gamma -rays through the studied domain. 
Therefore , the target of the AM algorithm  is to find the value of the linear attenuation 
coefficient (μ, cm-1) that minimizes the value of I -divergence. More details about the 
mathematical derivation and implementation  of the AM algorithm  for reconstructing  
images  can be found elsewhere [66,73] .  
For image reconstruction, the domain of the studied bubble column cross  section 
was divided into a resolution of 80×80 pixels and applied to all images  that presented in 
this work. Therefore, each single pixel represents an area of 1.905 mm × 1.905 mm for 6-
inch bubble column s with or without  vertical  internals.  After the  linear attenuation 
coefficient  was reconstructed  for an individual scan, the gas holdup distribution is 
calculated  through a specific procedure  that will be explained  in the  next section. 113 
 
 
 Furthermore, the line and azimuthal averaging are computed to represent the diameter 
profile s for the gas holdup.  Before the CT scan begins , the bubble column is operated at a 
selected condition ( i.e., the studied superficial gas velocity) for at least 20 minutes to allow 
the flow rate reading and the flow inside the column to reach a steady state. The moment 
that th e selected operating conditions achieve a steady state, the CT scanner  is turned on to 
scan the column at the selected axial level ( L/D = 5.1). For radiation safety considerations, 
the CT technique is shielded with  a lead on four sides to reduce and eliminate the radiation 
dose where the dose rate of one foot  (0.3048 m) from the CT is less than 0.03 mR/ hr. 
Hence, this CT technique is safe to use if all operational protocols are followed  and applied. 
Note that  these operations  protocols were  established and approved by the Department of 
Environmental Health and Safety at Missouri University Science and Technology. More  
details about the software and hardware used by the  DSCT  technique are available 
elsewhere Varma [75] and Varma et al. [66]. 
2.3. VALIDATION OF THE CT MEASUREMENTS  
Two concentric cylinders of Plexiglas® were  used as a phantom as  illustrated in  
Figure 6 to validate our CT measur ements . Both cylinders were glued  onto the flat plate of 
Plexiglas® . The diameters of the inner and outer cylinder s were 3  inches (0.0762 m) and 
6 inches (0.1524 m) , respectively. The Phantom  was well centered and aligned in the 
middle of the CT technique as displayed in  Figure 6. Individual scans have been performed 
for the phantom with different cases as follows:  
• Case I: Empty Phantom  
• Case II: The annular section was filled with water, whereas  the inner section was 
empty  114 
 
 
  
Figure 6: Dual -source gamma ray computed tomography (CT) technique with phantom  
 
The following equation gives the transmission ratio  [76,77] : 
𝑇=𝐼
𝐼°=𝑒−𝜌𝜇̅𝑙 (1) 
𝐿𝑛(𝐼
𝐼°)=−𝜌𝜇̅𝑙 (2) 
𝐿𝑛(𝐼°
𝐼)=+𝜌𝜇̅𝑙 (3) 
where (𝑇) is the transmission ratio, (𝐼°) is the initial intensity of the photons,  (𝐼) is the 
intensity of  the photons transmitted across some distance  l, ρ is density of medium (g/cm3), 
μ̅  is the mass attenuation coefficient (cm2/g), and  𝑙  is the path length through the medium 
(cm). The measured quantity 𝐿𝑛(𝐼°
𝐼) is equal to the integral sum of the attenuation through 
the material along the beam path.  
 For the gamma -ray computed tomography  technique , the attenuations are 
measured along a number of such beam paths through the bubble  column from different 
Air 
Water  
115 
 
 
 directions around it. Here , the transmission ratio and sinograms  have been plotted for each 
scan to identify the artifacts in the beginning stage of  performing the experiments and  
processing the data.  
 The x-axis of the transmission ratio plot represents the angular position of the 
projection in the fan beam , while the y-axis represents the transmission ratio  (T), which is 
estimated  from the incident count  (no column between the source and its detectors)  and the 
attenuated counts based on  the materials  used. Each pixel in the sinogram figures represents 
the transmission ratio for the corresponding projection  number ( y-axis) and the s ource 
position (view) ( x-axis).

  From Figure 7 and Figure 8 one can clearly distinguish the walls of the phantom 
for the case s I and II. Moreover, the transmission ratio figures  appear smooth  and, 
symmetric, with no detector artifacts.  They confirm the quality of the measurement and the 
image reconstruction method . 
 Figure 7 and Figure 8 demonstrate the validation of CT measurements through 
scanning and reconstructing linear attenuation coefficient images for different cases of the 
phantom (see Figure 6). These figures  show  the linear attenuation coefficient distributions 
reconstructed by the AM algorithm  for different cases  of the phantom . In these figures, the 
dimension s and geometry  of the phantom were reproduced by the scan, and the air-water 
were  clearly distinguished . Also, the reconstructed linear attenuation coefficients for air, 
water, and Plexiglas®  were  compared  with the theoretical linear attenuation coefficients 
of air (0.0001 cm-1), water (0.0857 cm-1), and Plexiglas®  (0.0988 cm-1), and they showed 
good agreement for all cases.  
 The figures demonstrate that the CT technique was capable of capturing the 
thickness of the  inner and outer sections of the phantom. Furthermore, the linear attenuation 
images displayed in Figure 9, Figure 10, and Figure 11 clearly  show that the CT technique 
was able to capture and reproduce the arrangement and location of each of the vertical  
internals as well as of the column  wall. 
 These images confirm the quality of this CT technique and also the image 
reconstruction algorithm (AM).  This means that the CT is capable of capturing  a small 
maldistribution in the multiphase  reactor if it exists.

 2.4.  GAS HOLDUP ESTIMATION  
2.4.1.  Gas Holdup Estimation for a Bubble Column without Vertical 
Internals (Two -Phase System).  For a two -phase bubble column without vertical  internals 
(air-water) operating at any superficial gas velocity, the total attenuation in each pi xel can 
be written  as [78] 
𝐴𝑔−𝑙,𝑖𝑗=(𝜌𝑔𝜇̅𝑔𝑙𝑔+𝜌𝑙𝜇̅𝑙𝑙𝑙)𝑖𝑗 (4) 
Since  𝑙𝑔=𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗,𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝑙𝑙=𝜀𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗,𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝐿𝑖𝑗=(𝑙𝑔+𝑙𝑙)𝑖𝑗 
Eq. (4) becomes   
𝐴𝑔−𝑙,𝑖𝑗=𝜌𝑔𝜇̅𝑔𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗+𝜌𝑙𝜇̅𝑙𝜀𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗 (5) 
Since  𝜀𝑔+𝜀𝑙=1, Eq. (5) can be written as:  
𝐴𝑔−𝑙,𝑖𝑗=𝜌𝑔𝜇̅𝑔𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗+𝜌𝑙𝜇̅𝑙(1−𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗)𝐿𝑖𝑗 (6) 
𝐴𝑔−𝑙,𝑖𝑗=𝜌𝑔𝜇̅𝑔𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗+𝜌𝑙𝜇̅𝑙𝐿𝑖𝑗−𝜌𝑙𝜇̅𝑙𝐿𝑖𝑗𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗 (7) 
For a bubble column filled with water only (single phase), the attenuation in each pixel can 
be written  as 
𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗=𝜌𝑙𝜇̅𝑙𝜀𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗=𝜌𝑙𝜇̅𝑙𝐿𝑖𝑗 ,𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝜀𝑙,𝑖𝑗=1 (8) 
By substitut ing Eq. (8) into Eq. (7), the following is obtain ed: 
𝐴𝑔−𝑙,𝑖𝑗=𝜌𝑔𝜇̅𝑔𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗+𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗−𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗 (9) 
Since  
𝜌𝑎𝑖𝑟,𝜇𝑎𝑖𝑟(0.0012  𝑔𝑐𝑚3⁄ ,0.0001  𝑐𝑚−1)≪ 𝜌𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 ,𝜇𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 (0.997  𝑔𝑐𝑚3⁄ ,0.086  𝑐𝑚−1) 
The attenuation caused by the gas phase (air) is negligible. This is a general 
simplification that also applies to the FT synthesis reaction mixture where the attenuation 119 
 
 
 caused by the mixture of gases (CO and H 2) is still negligible compared to the liquid phase 
and catalyst (slurry) solid. Therefore, Eq. (9) becomes:  
𝐴𝑔−𝑙,𝑖𝑗=𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗−𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗 (10) 
𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗=1−𝐴𝑔−𝑙,𝑖𝑗
𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗 (11) 
Since

𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗=𝜌𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝜇̅𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗=𝜇𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗  
Eq. (11) becomes

𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗=1−𝜇𝑔−𝑙,𝑖𝑗 𝐿𝑖𝑗
𝜇𝑙,𝑖𝑗 𝐿𝑖𝑗=1−𝜇𝑔−𝑙,𝑖𝑗
𝜇𝑙,𝑖𝑗 (12) 
Also, the liquid holdup can be estimated  directly from the following  equation:  
𝜀𝑙,𝑖𝑗=1−𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗 (13) 
where 𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗 is the gas holdup in each pixel, 𝜇𝑔−𝑙,𝑖𝑗 is the linear attenuation of the gas-liquid 
in each pixel (cm-1), 𝜇𝑙,𝑖𝑗 is the linear attenuation of  the liquid in each pixel (cm-1) which 
was obtained  by scanning  the column filled with liquid only, and  𝐿𝑖𝑗 is the length along 
which a particular gamma ray beam passes through this pixel.  
 According  to the above equations, the time –averaged cross -section al gas holdup 
distribution in bubble column without internals was obta ined by applying the following 
scanning steps : 
➢ Performing a scan without the column , which was considered  a reference scan 
(𝐼°) 120 
 
 
 ➢ Conducting  a scan of the column filled with water  only to get (𝐼𝑙) and then 
calculat ing the  transm ission ratio ( counts  of the column filled with  
water/ refer ence counts ) to determin e 𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗.  
➢ Scanning the column with gas -liquid ( in operation ) (𝐼𝑔−𝑙) at the desired 
conditions  and then comput ing the transm ission ratio ( counts  of the column gas -
liquid /reference counts ) to determin e 𝐴𝑔−𝑙,𝑖𝑗.  
Applying  the alternating minimization (AM) algorithm for each transmission 
(𝐼𝑔−𝑙) and (𝐼𝑙) individually,  produces the  linear attenuation coefficients for gas -liquid 
𝜇𝑔−𝑙,𝑖𝑗 and liquid 𝜇𝑙,𝑖𝑗 respectively. Finally , the local  gas and liquid holdup can be directly 
calculated using Eqs . (12) and (13).  
2.4.2.  Gas Holdup Estimation for a Bubble Column with Vertical Internals 
(Three -Phase System).  Determining the cross -sectional gas holdup  distribution for three 
phase s that are moving dynamically  requires a dual gamma -ray. However, in this study  for 
the bubble column with  vertical  internal  (solid)  (air-solid -liquid), one gamma -ray source is 
adequate  to quantify the gas holdup  because the vertical internals  (solid)  are stationary. 
Hence , for the bubble column with vertical  internals (air -solid -liquid ) operated  at any 
superficial gas velocity , the total att enuation in each pixel can be written as  
𝐴𝑔−𝑙−𝑠,𝑖𝑗=(𝜌𝑔𝜇̅𝑔𝑙𝑔+𝜌𝑙𝜇̅𝑙𝑙𝑙+𝜌𝑠𝜇̅𝑠𝑙𝑠)𝑖𝑗 (14) 
Since  𝑙𝑔=𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗, 𝑙𝑙=𝜀𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗, 𝑙𝑠=𝜀𝑠,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗   𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒  𝐿𝑖𝑗=𝑙𝑔+𝑙𝑙+𝑙𝑠

 121 
 
 
 Since   𝜀𝑔+𝜀𝑙+𝜀𝑠=1, Eq. (15) can be written as   
𝐴𝑔−𝑙−𝑠,𝑖𝑗=𝜌𝑔𝜇̅𝑔𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗+𝜌𝑙𝜇̅𝑙𝐿𝑖𝑗(1−𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗−𝜀𝑠,𝑖𝑗)+𝜌𝑠𝜇̅𝑠𝜀𝑠,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗 (16)

𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝜌𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 ,𝜇𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 (0.997  𝑔𝑐𝑚3⁄ ,0.086  𝑐𝑚−1. Therefore , the attenuation caused by the 
gas phase (air) is negligible. Hence,  Eq. (16) becomes  
𝐴𝑔−𝑙−𝑠,𝑖𝑗=𝜌𝑙𝜇̅𝑙𝐿𝑖𝑗(1−𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗−𝜀𝑠,𝑖𝑗)+𝜌𝑠𝜇̅𝑠𝜀𝑠,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗 (17) 
Since 𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗=𝜌𝑙𝜇̅𝑙𝜀𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗=𝜌𝑙𝜇̅𝑙𝐿𝑖𝑗 ,𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝜀𝑙,𝑖𝑗=1, for a bubble column without 
internals filled water only,  Eq. (1 7) becomes  
𝐴𝑔−𝑙−𝑠,𝑖𝑗=𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗−𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗−𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝜀𝑠,𝑖𝑗+𝜌𝑠𝜇̅𝑠𝜀𝑠,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗 (18) 
For scanning bubble  column with  vertical  internals (air -solid)  only, the total attenuation in 
each pixel can be written  as 
𝐴𝑔−𝑠,𝑖𝑗=𝜌𝑔𝜇̅𝑔𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗+𝜌𝑠𝜇̅𝑠𝜀𝑠,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗 (19) 
Since  𝜀𝑔+𝜀𝑠=1, Eq. (19) can be written as  
𝐴𝑔−𝑠,𝑖𝑗=𝜌𝑔𝜇̅𝑔(1−𝜀𝑠,𝑖𝑗)𝐿𝑖𝑗+𝜌𝑠𝜇̅𝑠𝜀𝑠,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗 (20) 
Since 𝜌𝑔,𝜇𝑔≪ 𝜌𝑠,𝜇𝑠 , the attenuation caused by the gas phase (air) is negligible                      
therefore,  𝜌𝑔𝜇̅𝑔(1−𝜀𝑠,𝑖𝑗)𝐿𝑖𝑗≅0. Eq. (2 0) becomes  
𝐴𝑔−𝑠,𝑖𝑗=𝜌𝑠𝜇̅𝑠𝜀𝑠,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗 (21) 
For scanning  column with vertical  internals filled water (liquid -solid), the total 
attenuation in each pixel can be written  as 
𝐴𝑙−𝑠,𝑖𝑗=𝜌𝑙𝜇̅𝑙𝜀𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗+𝜌𝑠𝜇̅𝑠𝜀𝑠,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗 (22) 
Since  𝜀𝑙+𝜀𝑠=1, Eq. (22) can be written as  122 
 
 
 𝐴𝑙−𝑠,𝑖𝑗=𝜌𝑙𝜇̅𝑙𝐿𝑖𝑗(1−𝜀𝑠,𝑖𝑗)+𝜌𝑠𝜇̅𝑠𝜀𝑠,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗 (23) 
Recall  that  𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗=𝜌𝑙𝜇̅𝑙𝜀𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗=𝜌𝑙𝜇̅𝑙𝐿𝑖𝑗 ,𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝜀𝑙,𝑖𝑗=1, for a bubble column without  
internals filled water only. T herefore , Eq. (23) becomes  
𝐴𝑙−𝑠,𝑖𝑗=𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗−𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝜀𝑠,𝑖𝑗+𝜌𝑠𝜇̅𝑠𝜀𝑠,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗 (24) 
By further simplification , Eq. (2 4) becomes  
𝜌𝑠𝜇̅𝑠𝜀𝑠,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗=𝐴𝑙−𝑠,𝑖𝑗−𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗+𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝜀𝑠,𝑖𝑗 (25) 
By substituting Eq.  (25) into Eq. ( 18) results in

By canceling the similar terms from the above equation , the above equatio n becomes   
𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗=𝐴𝑙−𝑠,𝑖𝑗 − 𝐴𝑔−𝑙−𝑠,𝑖𝑗
𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗 (27) 
Eq. ( 27) becomes  
𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗=𝐴𝑙−𝑠,𝑖𝑗 − 𝐴𝑔−𝑙−𝑠,𝑖𝑗

where 𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗 is the local gas holdup in each pixel for a bubble column with  vertical

 velocity) in each pixel (cm-1), and 𝜇𝑙,𝑖𝑗 is linear attenuation of liquid  only in each pixel (cm-
1). The time –averaged cross -section al gas holdup distribution in a bubbl e column equipped 
with vertical  internals  was obtained by applying the following  procedure:  
➢ Performing a scan without the column as a reference scan (𝐼°). 
➢ Conducting a scan for the column  without internals  filled with water  only to get  
(𝐼𝑙) and then calculat ing the transm ission ratio ( 𝐼𝑙𝐼°⁄) to determin e 𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗 .  
➢ Scan ning the column with  vertical  internals and filled with water (𝐼𝑙,𝑠) and then 
finding the transmission  ratio ( 𝐼𝑙,𝑠𝐼°⁄) to calculat e 𝐴𝑙−𝑠,𝑖𝑗 .  
➢ Scan ning the column with vertical  internals operat ed at the studied superficial gas 
velocity  (𝐼𝑔,𝑙,𝑠) and then find ing the  transmission ratio ( 𝐼𝑔,𝑙,𝑠𝐼°⁄) to 
calculat e 𝐴𝑔−𝑙−𝑠,𝑖𝑗 .  
Using the alternating minimization (AM) algorithm for each transmission  
independently  produces the  linear attenuation coefficients for the liquid -solid 𝜇𝑙−𝑠,𝑖𝑗 , gas-
liquid -solid 𝜇𝑔−𝑙−𝑠,𝑖𝑗, and liquid 𝜇𝑙,𝑖𝑗, respectively. Finally, the local gas holdup  can be 
directly estimated  using Eq. (28).  
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
Our advanced gamma -ray computed tomography (CT) technique was used in th is 
present investigation to visualize and quantify the effect of  the existence of  the vertical 
internals  and their size s on the gas -liquid distribution in a 6-inch Plexiglas bubble colum n 
for the air -water cold flow system at different superficial gas velocit ies. All CT scans were 
performed  in a fully developed flow region (L/D = 5.1). Two different sizes of the vertical 
internals were used, which were arranged  in a circular -like shape for both sizes. In the 124 
 
 
 following subsections, the unprecedented results of the  impact of the presence of dense and 
sparse vertical int ernals, internals diameter s, and superficial gas velocity on the overall, 
local gas holdup distributions, and their diametrical profiles were analyzed , discussed,  and 
presented in more details.  
3.1. REPRODUCIBILITY OF THE CT MEASUREMENTS  
For demonstrating the reproducibility of the CT scans, the measurement s of the 
time-averaged cross -sectional gas holdup  distribution and its diametrical profile in a bubble 
column were replicated . These replications were carried out in a 6-inch bubble colu mn 
without vertical internals that operated under a superficial gas velocity of 20 cm/s.  The CT 
scans were repeated  at one axial level of 78 cm  (L/D = 5.1)  above the gas distributor, which 
represents the fully developed flow region.  
 The reconstructed cros s-sectional gas holdup distributions for both experiments 
that are presented in Figure 12a and b show that the  local  gas holdup  distribution  for both 
scans  (experiment s 1 and 2) are similar. Moreover, the azimuthally averaged of the gas 
holdup diametrical profiles were computed  from the cross -sectional gas holdup  images by 
circumferential  averaging the pixels to quantify  the difference between the gas holdup  
profiles. It is evident from Figure 12c that the  gas holdup  profiles for both experiments  are 
almost identical and similar in the magnitude for most diameter positions of the bubble 
column. For example, the  percentage of  relative differences  in the gas holdup  values  for 
the two repeat ed experiments at the region close to the center (where the difference is high) 
is 3.3%.  
These obtained results either for the reconstructed cross -sectional gas holdup  
distribution s or diametrical profiles confirm the excellent reproducibility that was achieved  125 
 
 
 with the CT measurements. It is obvious that , there i s no need to replicate CT scan for each 
operating condition. Despite that , in this present study, the CT scan was repeated twice for 
each operating condition to reduce the measurement error and check the reproducibility of 
gas holdup  data. Therefore, the a verage of these two measurements was used to present the 
diametrical gas holdup  profiles. Furthermore, the error bars were calculated  and plotted for 
all gas holdup  profiles  that presented in this work . 
 As another independent method to check the accuracy of the gas holdup data  
obtained by our CT technique , the overall gas holdup obtained by bed expansion method 
at the same operating condition was compared  with the  average of the cross -sectional gas 
holdu p obtained by CT technique. The cross -sectional mean gas holdup  (εg̅) was calculated  
from gas holdup  distribution image by first azimuthally averaging and then performing 
another averaging by using the following equation:  
𝜀𝑔̅=2
𝑅2∫𝜀(𝑟)𝑟𝑑𝑟𝑅
0 (29) 
The above equation was solved numerically by using Simpson's rule where R 
represents the radius of the bubble column and 𝜀(𝑟) represents the values of a gas holdup 
at a specific radius (r) . The percentage of relative difference between the mean of the cross -
sectional gas holdup and the overall gas holdup was found to be 3.7% , which confirm s the 
high accuracy and the reliability of the CT technique .

 3.2. EFFECT OF THE PRESENCE OF VERTICAL INTERNALS AND THEIR 
SIZE ON THE OVERALL GAS HOLDUP  
To demonstrate the impact of the presence of dense and sparse vertical internals as 
well as their size on the overall gas holdup, a method of  the bed expansion  (change in the 
bed height between dynamic and static)  was used to quantify the overall gas holdup in a 6-
inch Plexiglas bubble columns with and without vertical internals based on following the 
equation:  
𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑙  𝑔𝑎𝑠  ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑢𝑝 =ℎ𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑦𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑖𝑐  𝑏𝑒𝑑 −ℎ𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑐  𝑙𝑖𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑑  
ℎ𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑦𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑖𝑐  𝑏𝑒𝑑 (30) 
The dynamic level s of the bed  for all experiments were  maintained at 62 -inches 
(1.6 m) (L/D = 10.3) above the gas distributor by changing the initial static liquid level s 
corresponding to each operating superficial gas velocity.  An adhesive measuring tape was 
attached to the column  and used  to visually  monitor both the static liquid and dynamic 
levels during the experiments. Figure 13 depicts the effects of the presence of the vertical 
internals and their size as well as the superficial gas velocity on the overall gas holdup  in 
bubble columns in the presence and absence of  the vertical internals for the air -water 
system. Figure 13 shows a convergence in the values of the overall gas holdup obtained in 
the bubble column with 0.5 or 1 -inch internals . This convergence between the values of 
the gas holdup  can be explained by using almost the same free CSA for the flow , which 
was used to  calculat e superficial gas velocities where for both cases  (with 0.5 or 1 -inch 
internals)  the bundle of vertical internals almost blocked 25% of the column cross -section al 
area and hence the same superficial gas velocity was applied for both cases that lead to 
obtain ing almost the same magnitude of the gas holdup . Furthermore, the values of the 
overall gas holdup obtained  in bubble column in the absence of vertical internals were 128 
 
 
 achieved  in bubble column equipped with 0.5 and 1 -inch internals operated at a superficial 
gas velocity  calculated based on free CSA for the flow. These results and findings of overall 
gas holdup are in line with the previously reported investigation  for the air-water  system  
[60,61 ,79].

inch bubble column operated at different superficial gas velocities  
 
3.3. EFFECT OF SUPERFICIAL GAS VELOCITY ON THE TIME -AVERAGED  
CROSS -SECTIONAL GAS HOLDUP DISTRIBUTION AND THEIR 
DIAMETRICAL PROFILES  
The time-averaged gas holdup  reconstructed CT images for the bubble column s 
with and without vertical internals are displayed  in Figure 14. These images  show the local 
gas holdup  for each pixel, where  each single pixel represents an area of 1.905 mm × 1.905 
mm of a 6-inch (0.14 m) bubble column. The color bar in each image repre sents the range 
of gas holdup , where red indicates high gas holdup and blue signifies  low gas holdup  (high 
liquid holdup ). The obtained  two-dimensional scanned images visualize qualitatively how 00.10.20.30.40.50.6

 the gas and liquid phases are distributed  inside the bubble columns in the presence or not 
of the vertical internals at different operating conditions. As can be seen from  the 2D 
images in  Figure 14, the magnitude of the gas holdup rises with increases  in the  superficial 
gas velocities for bubble column s either with or  without  vertical  internals. In addition , the 
well-known phenomena in a bubble column without obstacles (higher gas holdup in the 
core of the column and lower in the wall region) still obtains in the bubble column equipped 
with dense  internals for both sizes of internals.  However, based on the visualization of gas -
liquid distributions  for bubble columns with and without vertical internals at different 
superficial gas velocities , the bubble column with 1 -inch vertical internals exhibits the 
common core -annulus (ascending of liquid in the center and liquid descending on wall  
region) liquid circulation very similar to the one obtained in the bubble column without 
vertical internals.  
Additionally, the gas holdup distribution images further revealed that the higher gas 
holdup was achieved in the core region of bubble columns wit hout vertical internals while 
the lowest gas holdup was obtained in the wall region because of the high shear stress (i.e., 
typically maximum at the wall of the column) in this region [17]. Such effect of shear stress 
induces the bubbles to move and breakup into smaller bubbles in the core of the column, 
which is characterized by less shear stress. Accordingly, these small bubbles rise with low 
velocity, causing an increase in the residence  time for these bubbles and hence increasing 
the gas holdup magnitude in the center of the column. However, for bubble columns with 
vertical internals, the maximum gas holdup values are obtained in the center gaps between 
the vertical internals because  the bubbles in this area  are suffering from extra wall shear , 
which is generated by the walls of these vertical internal tubes. This wall shear of the 130 
 
 
 vertical internals forces the bubbles to move from the area of the vicinity of vertical 
internals toward the  center of the space (i.e., gaps of internals). Consequently, the rising 
bubbles (i.e., bubbles confined in the gaps of vertical internals) are subject to more 
resistance to flow, especially under a high superficial gas velocity, causing slowly rising 
bubb les through these gaps and hence resulting high gas holdup in these regions (i.e., center 
of the gaps) and low in the vicinity of the vertical internals.  
 This phenomenon of increasing gas holdups in the gaps of vertical internals has 
been confirmed recent ly by the CFD simulation  [58,59,80]  for these bubble columns with 
vertical internals under the same operating conditions.  Moreover, upon  observing  of each 
image, it is evident that all images exhibit  a symmetric  gas holdup  distribution for all ranges 
of superficial gas velocities.  However , the bubble column with 1 -inch internals (sparse 
arrangement) gives  a more symmetric  distribution  than the column equipped with 0.5-inch 
internals (dense arrangement ). Furthermore, the most remarkable observation of the 
scanned images is that a bubble column equipped with 0.5 -inch internals  that arranged 
uniformly in a  circular configuration can significantly reduce the maldistribu tion 
(asymmetrical  distribution ) that obtained in a bubble column equipped with 0.5 -inch 
internals arranged non -uniformly in a hexagonal arrangement (Al-Mesfer et al.  [45] and 
Al-Mesfer  [79]), especially when using a high superficial gas velocity.  
 From the perspective of the industr ial process, the performance of the bubble/slurry 
bubble column s will be enhance d significantly by reducing the maldistribution (non -
uniform gas-liquid  distribution) because it decreases the magnitude of the specific 
interfacial area and consequently decreases the mass transfer between phases. Moreover, 
the maldistrib ution increases the liquid back -mixing as well as the possibility of the 131 
 
 
 forma tion of hot and dead zones and eventually leads to a runaway of the reactor,  in 
particular during  exothermic reaction s [81,82] .

 The obtained gas holdup distribution s for a bubble column without vertical internals 
for air -water system  scanned by the CT technique were  qualitatively consistent with the 
gas holdup distribution reported by Chen et al.  [38], Rados et al.  [83], Shaikh  [31], and Al -
Mesfer et al.  [45] for the same air -water system .  
As mentioned earlier , the CT  technique  has been  capable of capturing the 
configurations of the internal bundles and their positions in side the column for all CT scans. 
Hence, the CT technique can not  only be used to provide knowledge about the phase 
distribution and consequently the performance of the reactor , but it can also be used as a 
diagnostic tool for identifying integrity issues with internals .  
To provide quantifiable and easy to understand the results , further processing  is 
needed  for the time-averaged cross -sectional gas holdup distributions to obtain 
azimuthally, and line averaged gas holdup profiles  as well as the local gas holdup in each 
pixel of the CT scan image.  For each  of the azimuthally  averaged gas holdup  profiles, the 
values of the gas holdup for the  vertical  internals before the averaging process  were 
excluded  so that not to affect the calculated average with the outlier’s data. Moreover, to 
determine the azimuthally averaged profiles, a method was developed to divide the 
reconstructed image (80  × 80 pixels) in hal f (left and right ; 40 × 40 pixels) and then average 
them separa tely not to  smooth it  out and to achieve a more precise representation of the 
results. Furthermore, the error bars were  plotted for all figures in this work to quantify the 
reliability  and reproducibility of the CT measurements, which represent one standard 
deviation from the average  gas holdup  at every radial position. The calculated error bars 
were very slight as shown in all presented figures.  More details about the approach of 
excluding the vertical internals from gas holdup  distribution and their azimuthally averaged  133 
 
 
 can be found elsewhere [84].The results of the azimuthally averaged gas holdup profiles 
for bubble column s without , with 0.5-inch, and 1.0 -inch internal s at different superficial 
gas velocities are exhibited  in Figure 15, Figure 16 and Figure 17. Like a bubble column 
without obstacles, the magnitude of the gas holdup  for a bubble column with vertical 
internals increase d as the superficial gas velocity  increased . These figures further reveal 
that the shape of the gas holdup profile is parabolic for the bubble column without vertical  
internals , while,  the column with vertical  internals displayed wavy line profiles . 
Additionally,  each concave curvature in the gas holdup p rofile , whether for bubble column s 
equipped with 0.5 -inch or 1.0 -inch internals represents the azimuthally averaged values of 
the gas holdup among the gaps between internals for the  same bundle.  The different 
curvatures in  the gas holdup  profile s can be explained  by the following factors:  the internal 
bundle arrangement, gaps among the vertical  internals , and the size of the vertical  internals . 
For example, the bubble column equipped with 0.5 -inch internals produce d wavy line  
profiles  with a small concave  curvature , while the bubble column with 1.0 -inch internals 
produced a larger  concave curvature. Furthermore, Figure 16 and Figure 17 illustrate that 
the number and degree  of concav ity in the gas holdup  profile s indicate s the number of 
bundles and size of internals inside the bubble column s. For instance, the 0.5 -inch internal  
configuration  consist ed of three bundles of internals ; thus, the radial profile ha d three small 
concave  sections  for each side . In contrast,  the radial profile of the 1-inch internal s had one 
large concave  area and one area that was half concave in the center due to the 1.0 -inch 
internals configuration being composed of one bundle and one internal in the center.  The 
same wavy line gas holdup profiles were  reported by Al -Mesfer et al. [45] for a bubble 
column equipped with a 0.5 -inch dense internals.  134

Figure 18, Figure 19, and  Figure 20 present  the comparison of the azimuthally 
averaged of the gas holdup diametrical profiles  the total CSA e column s with or without 
vertical internals at different superficial gas velocities , which were calculated based on 
total CSA for bubble column without vertical internals while were  computed based on free 
CSA for bubble column  equipped  with vertical internals  (0.5 and 1 -inch internals) . 
According to these figures , the bubble column equipped with 1.0 -inch internals produced 
a higher gas holdup than  the bubble column with 0.5 -inch internals at the region between 
r/R = 0.25-0.45 and the region between r/R  = 0.7-0.9 for different superficial ga s velocities. 
Also, the gas holdup  values  of the bubble column with 1.0 -inch internals approach  the 
values of the gas holdup for the column without vertical  internal s in the  region r/R  = 0.25-
0.4. However,  at the churn turbulent flow regime ( at a superficial gas of 20 , and 45 cm/s),  
136 
 
 
 a significant increase in the gas holdup  values  was obtained  in the bubble column equipped 
with 1.0 -inch internals at the wall region as compared with  the bubble column s without or 
with 0.5 -inch internals.  The variation in the figures for the gas holdup  profiles due to the 
presence more vertical internals for 0.5 -inch internals  (30 of vertical internals)  than 1 -inch 
internals  (8 of vertical internals) . 
 Quantitatively, at a superficial gas velocity  of 45 c m/s, the gas holdup  value  
increased by 52% for the bubble column with the 1 -inch internal bundle at the wall region 
(r/R = 0.8) when  compared with the bubble column without internals , while it increased by 
39% when compared with the bubble column equipped with 0.5 -inch internals.  During the 
churn turbulent flow regime (heterogeneous flow), the presence of dense  vertical internals 
in the bubble column enhanced the bubble breakup, and bubble passage frequency  [85]. As 
a result, a significant number of small bubbles will be formed  in the column with vertical  
internals.  
This phenomenon was also confirmed  by a recent study conducted in our mReal 
lab that measured the bubble properties, such as specific interfacial area, bubble rise 
velocity, bubble passage frequency, and bubble chord lengths by using a four -point fiber 
optical probe on the same column for the air-water  system [47]. The availability of a 
significan t number of tiny bubbles in the column leads to an increase in the gas holdup  
magnitude  due to the small bubbles having a low bubble rise velocity (high drag force), 
and this leads to an increase in the residence time of gas (bubbles) as compared with large 
bubbles , which have a higher bubble rise velocity (less drag force).  137

However, it is evident from the presented figures that the gas holdup  values 
obtained in bubble column packed densely with vertical internals reaches  the values of the 
gas holdup in the core region of bubble column without vertical internals  while displaying 
a considerable increase near the wall region of the column.  This might be explained  by the 
fact that at a high superficial gas velocity  (churn turbulent flow regime) bubbles do not 
only move axially with varying bubble rise velocities  but also radially (perpendicular to 
the flow) toward the wall region due to the effect of interfacial forces, such as lift and 
dispersion forces . These forces depend mainly on bubble size; and hence, for a bubble 
column equipped with vertical internals, the  presence of bundle of the vertical  internals 
will allow to small bubbles (bubbles sma ller than the gap s among  the vertical internals) to 
pass through and circulate with liquid in the wall region, but the vertical internals will trap 
139 
 
 
 any large bubbles  (bigger than the gap  between the internals)  in the core region.  For that 
reason, the gas holdup in the bubble column with internals is similar to the gas holdup  
values at the center region of the bubble column without internals while larger gas holdup  
near the wall. This  significant increase  in the gas holdup  in the wall region for the bubble 
columns equipped with vertical internals can also be  seen distinctly in Figure 22, Figure 
23, Figure 25, and  Figure 26 for the vertical and horizontal line average d gas holdup  
profiles . This increase  in gas holdup magnitude becomes more pronounced with bubble 
column equipped with 1 -inch vertical internals due to the geometric configuration 
(circular -like shape) for 1 -inch internals that has one central tube while the 0.5 -inch vertical 
internals configuration does not have a central tube. However, from Figure 21 and Figure 
24, one can observe that the line average (i.e., gas holdup averaging along vertical and 
horizontal  lines of  pixels  over the cross -sectional image ) of the gas holdup diametrical 
profiles in bubb le columns with and without vertical internals are relatively similar to each 
other under the studied superficial gas velocity of 5 cm/s based on free CSA for flow 
despite using different size of vertical internals. This convergence of gas holdup values 
indicates that  the presence of vertical internals and their sizes do not affect the gas holdup 
magnitude under this superficial gas velocity within bubbly flow regime condition (i.e., at 
a superficial gas velocity of 5 cm/s). This bubbly flow regime is characterized by the 
presence of uniform small bubble sizes with almost the same bubble rise velocity. 
Accordingly, these bubbles while they are formed  at the distributor region and rise, they 
are not subjected to coalescence and break up due to bubble -bubble and bubble -vertical 
internals interactions under this condition, especially the gaps bet ween the vertical internals 
are bigger than the size s of the rising bubbles.  140

The existence of the central tube with 1 -inch vertical internals arrangement plays 
an important role in  distributing the gas -liquid flow inside the column where it helps to 
push and displaces the gas-liquid  toward the wall region. Also, the size of a pitch for 1 -
inch internal configuration (3.8 cm) approximately twice larger than 0.5 -inch internals (2.1 
cm) as shown in Figure 3, which provides a  large compartment among the  vertical  internals 
as compared with 0.5 -inch internals and hence will facilitate the passing of bubbles from 
the core of the column toward the wall region.  Moreover, at the churn turbulent flow 
regime, the bubbles that move radially from the center of column toward the wall region 
will face one bundle of the 7 vertical internals  in the case of bubble column with 1 -inch 
internals while face three bundles of the 30 vertical internals in the case of the bubble 
column with 0.5 -inch vertical internals and hence more resistance to movement of the 
142 
 
 
 bubbles  associated with the bubble column equipped with 0.5 -inch internals.  This 
difference between the gas holdup  values  obtained in the bubble column s with 0.5 -inch 
and 1 -inch vertical internal at wall region is expected to change the magnitude of the large -
scale liquid circulation and intensity of the liquid mixing  but unfortunately, this 
information is vastly unknown . Therefore, further experimental investigations are required 
to quantify the local liquid velocity for both sizes of vertical internals. These experimental 
studies are ongoing in our laboratory  to quantify the impact of the different diameters of 
the vertical internals on the 3D liquid velocity field and turbulent parameters by using 
advanced radioactive particle tracking (RPT ) technique  and will be reported in the future 
manuscripts .

 In this study, the gas holdup profiles were presented  in two ways, azimuthally 
(circularly) and line (vertically or horizontally) averaged gas holdup  profiles. The 
azimuthally averaged gas holdup was computed  by averaging the pixels of the 2D gas 
holdup  distribution circumferentially after excluding the values of the vertical internals . 
The azimuthally averaged  usually performs to any systems based on an axisymmetric 
assumption ( i.e., the values of gas holdup are constant in θ -direction) of the 2D gas holdu p 
distribution and this works properly for columns without internals such as bubble col umn 
[86], fluidized bed  [87], spouted bed  [88], pebble bed [89] and trickle bed  [90]. However, 
the axisymmetric of gas-liquid distribution rarely maintains in columns packed densely 
with vertical internals. Therefore, a line averaged gas holdup  profile was applied here as 
an alternative representation for gas holdup  data.  
 The vertical and horizontal lines  averaged gas holdup  profiles were calculated  by 
averaging the pixels of gas holdup distribution in vertical and horizontal order. To make 
sure which type of profiles more representative to gas holdup  data, the arithmetic mean of 
the cross -sectional gas holdup  distribution was calculated  and compared with arithmetic 
means of azimuthal and line profiles. The results of comparison reveal that the line 
averaged gas holdup  either vertically or horizontally  profiles  in more representative  than 
azimuthally one.  
 For instance, it was found that the percentages of relative difference between the 
mean of the cross -sectional gas holdup distribution and the average for azimuthally gas 
holdup profile at a superficial gas velocity of 45 cm/s for bubble columns without internals, 
with 0.5 -inch internals, and with 1 -inch internals were 26.7%, 14.8%, and 9.8% 
respectively . While the percentages of relative difference were 8%, 8.3%, and 7.14% when 145 
 
 
 it was calculated between the mean of the cross -sectional gas holdup and the average of 
line gas hol dup profile at the same superficial gas velocity.  Furthermore, during the churn 
turbulent flow regime, particularly at a superficial gas velocity of 20 and 45 cm/s, the gas 
holdup values obtained in the bubble columns equipped with 0.5 -inch or 1 -inch verti cal 
internals have approached the values of the gas holdup of the bubble column without 
vertical internals at the core region of the column.  This only can be accomplished through 
operating the bubble column equipped with dense of the vertical internals under a 
superficial gas velocity calculated based on free CSA of the column.  
This key finding of the results was also observed previously by Al Mes fer [91], Al 
Mesfer et al. [45], and  Kagumba [44] when they studied the effect of using superficial gas 
velocity calculated based on the total and free CSA for the flow on the magnitude of the 
gas holdup for the air -water system in bubble column equippe d with dense  vertical 
internals.  
 To further highlight the influence of vertical internals on the gas holdup, the local 
gas holdup along the center line of pixels over the cross -sectional image (i.e., horizontal 
and vertical lines) for bubble columns with and without vertical internals operated under a 
superficial gas velocity of 45 cm/s are shown in Figure 27 and Figure 28. From these 
figures, one can notice that the parabolic gas holdup profile obtained in the bubble column 
without vertical internals has replac ed by wavy gas holdup profile with maximum gas 
holdup values in the center of the gaps for the vertical internals. This significant increase 
in the gas holdup values in these gaps is due to each vertical internal providing extra wall 
shear  [92,93] , which induces bubbles to move away from the vicinity of the internal walls 
and accumulate in the gaps between the internals , causing an increase in the gas holdup 146 
 
 
 values in these regions . Additionally, from the gas holdup distributions and local gas 
holdup profiles, one can deduce the behavior of liquid circulation and axial liqui d velocity 
due to the gas phase driving the liquid phase in the bubble columns (i.e., driving the liquid 
phase by  imbalance in buoyancy force and  rising bubbles of gas phase)  [40,94] .  
For example, the regions of the maximum gas holdup in the cross -sectional of gas 
holdup distribution indicate regions of ascending liquid, whereas regions of minimum gas 
holdup mark for descending liquid. Accordingly, the axial liquid velocity profiles in bubble 
column without  vertical internals breakup into the ascending areas in the center of the gaps 
and descending regions in the vicinity of the walls for the vertical internals. Therefore, the 
observed large eddies in the bubble column without vertical internals have segrega ted into 
small eddies within the size of gaps for vertical internals.  
Hence, it can be obviously concluded that the presence of vertical internals and 
their sizes have a substantial effect not only on the gas holdup distribution over the entire 
cross -sectional area of the columns but also on the velocity field. However, a study of the 
effect of the sizes of vertical internals, which covering 25% of the cross -sectional area to 
represent the heat -exchanging internals  used in the industrial FT synthesis, on t he liquid 
velocity field and turbulent parameters (Reynolds normal stress, Reynolds shear stress, and 
turbulent kinetic energy) is n ot available in the literature.  
This lack of data for liquid velocity field and turbulent parameters has been 
addressed in our laboratory (MReal) by using advanced radioactive particle tracking (RPT) 
technique and will be reported soon.

 4. REMARKS  
The influences of the presence of the bundle of the vertical internals and their size 
on the overall, local gas -liquid distributions and their profiles have been investigated in a 
6-inch (0.14 m) Plexiglas bubble column for the air -water system by using an  advanced 
gamma -ray computed tomography (CT) technique. The vertical internals for both sizes 
were  arranged circularly and fitted uniformly inside the bubble column where both 
diameters were having the same occluded area (~25%) of the column’s CSA to repre sent 
the blocking percentage of area in FT synthesis. The time -averaged cross -sectional gas 
holdup distributions and their profiles were visualized and quantified at different 
superficial gas velocities, which covering the homogeneous and heterogeneous flo w 
regimes. The summary of the remarks of this study is as follows:  
❖ No significant effect was observed when  using either 0.5 -inch or 1 -inch vertical 
internals in 6 -inch bubble column on the overall gas holdup values (i.e., measured by 
bed expansion) at diff erent superficial gas velocities. This is due to the operating 
superficial gas velocities for bubble column with vertical internals (either for 0.5 -inch 
or 1-inch in diameter) were estimated based on the free cross -sectional area for the flow 
(i.e., both s izes of the internals covering the same CSA) where the volumetric flow rate 
will be the same in both cases and lower than in the column without interna ls. Also, the 
overall gas holdup values that were achieved in the bubble column without vertical 
internal s at different superficial gas velocity are similar to those obtained in bubble 
columns equipped with 0.5 -inch and 1 -inch of the vertical internals if these columns 
with vertical internals operated under the same superficial gas velocity but calculated 149 
 
 
 based on free CSA for the flow. However, the size of vertical internals has a significant 
effect on the gas holdup distribution over the entire cross -sectional area of the column.  
❖ The imaging  of the gas -liquid distribution inside the  bubble columns with and without 
vertical internals reveal that the phenomen on of the core -annular liquid circulation 
pattern, which commonly observed in the bubble column without vertical internals still 
exist  in bubble column packed densely with vertical  internals.  
❖ The circular configuration s for either 0.5 or 1 -inch of the  vertical  internals inside the 
column significantly reduce the maldistribution , which was reported in the literature.  
❖ The reconstructed CT images show that the bubble columns equipped w ith or without 
vertical  internals display ed a uniform cross -sectional gas holdup distribution  
(symmetric) for all studied superficial gas velocit ies. However, the bubble column  
packed  with 1 -inch of the vertical  internals (sparse arrangement) produced  more 
symmetric distribution s than the column equipped with 0.5 -inch of the vertical internals 
(dense arrangement).  
❖ The magnitude of the gas holdup increases significantly with the superficial gas 
velocity for bubble columns with or without  vertical  internals. However, the gas holdup 
profile took on the wavy line shape  in the bubble column with vertical internals due to 
the design and the number  of the vertical internals, whereas the column without 
obstacles exhibits a parabolic gas holdup profile . 
❖ At the churn turbulent flow regime, especially in  the superficial gas velocit ies 20 and 
45 cm/s, a noticeable increase in the magnitude of the gas holdup near the wall ( in the 
dimensionless radius, r /R=0.8)  region  is obtained based on  the insertion bundle of the  
vertical  internals  in the column as compared with a bubble column without obstacles. 150 
 
 
 However, the bubble column with 1 -inch internals exhibit ed higher gas holdup than the 
column equipped with 0.5 -inch internals .  
❖ The presence of the central tube with 1 -inch internal s configuration, pitch size as well 
as the number of vertical internals plays a major role in the distribution of gas -liquid 
over the cross -sectional area of the column.  
❖ The values of the gas holdup  obtained  in the core  of the bubble column without  vertical  
internals are found to be similar to those  in the bubble column equipped with vertical  
internals when these  column s with vertical internal s operate at a high superficial gas 
velocity (churn turbulent flo w regime ) and calculated based on  the free cross -sectional 
area (CSA) for the flow.  
❖ The originality of the obtained data and findings is worthy as benchmark data for 
developing and validating a 3D  CFD simulation and hydrodynamic model  for the air-
water system .  
❖ The present study was limited to one type of configuration (a circular arrangement  of 
tubes ) and a lab-scale bubble column. Therefore, further investigations are 
recommended to visualize, measure, analyze , and quantify the effect of the different 
tube bundle arrangement s on gas  holdup distributions and their profiles in the various 
scale s of bubble columns.  Such kind of analysis can be conducted using properly 
validated CFD code and models.

ABSTRACT  
An advanced gamma -ray computed tomography (CT) technique was used for the 
first time to visualize and quantify the impacts of the presence of heat -exchanging tubes 
and their configurations on the gas -liquid distributions and their profiles in a 6 -inch (0.1524 
m O.D.) Plexiglas® bubble column in an  air-water reactor. Two superficial gas velocities 
(i.e., 0.2 and 0.45 m/s) were employed to simulate the churn turbulent flow regime. To 
investigate the impact of vertical internals configurations, three arrangements (i.e., 
hexagonal, circular without a c entral internal, and circular with a central internal) were 
employed in addition to the column with no internals. Using the same sized vertical 
internals and the same occluded cross -sectional area (CSA), it was found that the 
configuration of the vertical internals significantly impacted the gas holdup distribution 
over the CSA of the column. All studied superficial gas velocities resulted in symmetrical 
gas holdup distributions over the CSA of the bubble columns without vertical internals; 
however, the col umns equipped densely with vertical internals did not have symmetrical 
gas holdup distributions. The presence of an extra central tube in the circular configuration 
played a key role in the gas -liquid distribution over the CSA of the bubble column. The 
hexagonal configuration had the advantage of providing the best spread of the gas phase 
over the entire CSA of the column. Gas holdup values at the wall region of the bubble 161 
 
column increased with the addition of vertical tubes in all investigated configuratio ns. 
However, a remarkable increase in the gas holdup values was obtained with the hexagonal 
configuration. The experimental data (i.e., gas holdup distributions and their diametrical 
profiles) can help to evaluate and validate three -dimensional (3 -D) compu tational fluid 
dynamics (CFD) simulations to better predict the hydrodynamic parameters involved in 
these types of reactors.

1. INTRODUCTION  
In the chemical  [1], biochemical  [2], petroleum  [3], petrochemical  [4], 
metallurgical  [5], and waste treatment indus tries [6] as well as  in many  industrial  processes  
[7], bubble/slurry bubble column reactors are used due to their advantages over other 
multiphase  reactors  in terms of reactions  and chemistry . Some of these processes  are 
associated with highly exothermic reactions th at require inserting dense heat -exchanging 
tubes inside thes e reactors to remove the excess heat and to maintain the desired conditions 
of these reactors , such as for the production of benzoic acid (with a heat of reaction of  −628 
kJ/mol)  [8], productio n of cyclohexanol (with a heat of reaction of −294 kJ/mol)  [9], 
production of acetone (with a heat of reaction of −255 kJ/mol)  [10], Fischer -Tropsch (FT) 
synthesis (with heat of reaction of −210 kJ/mol)  [11–13], and many others . The existence 
of such den se bundle of cooling tubes  strongly  impacts and alter s the reactor ’s fluid 162 
 
dynamics  in a very complex manner  that affect s the phase s distribution s of the reactants 
(gas-liquid  in bubble column or gas -catalyst -liquid in a slurry bubble column)  and thus  
affect s the performance of these reactors  [14,15]. The non -uniform distribution of gas-
liquid  in a bubble column  or gas -solid -liquid in slurry bubble column  durin g the chemical 
reaction creates liquid/slurry circulation, radial and axial temperature gradients, and hot 
spots, where  in the worst case scenario , a reactor  runaway may occur , thereby  reducing  the 
activity of the catalyst  [16,17] .  
Understanding the influence of heat -exchanging tubes and their arrangements  
(configurations)  on the phase distribution in these reactors  is essential  to improv ing the 
design of these heat-exchanging  tubes to enhanc e the gas-liquid  or gas -slurry distributions  
and the dynamics  inside these reactors. This enhancement of phase’ distribution s inside  
these reactors offers better contact between reactant phases , which  enhance  the heat, mass  
transfer , and chemical reaction  rates,  and ultimately affects the overall performance  of the 
reactor . However, comprehending such complexity has been hampered due to lack of 
implementing advanced measurement techniques  [12,18] . Therefore, fundamental 
knowledge of the impacts of the heat -exchang e tubes on the hydrodynamics of 
bubble/slurry bubble columns is necessary  to enhance the performance, design, and scale -
up of these reactors.  
The hydrodynamic studies of bubble/slurry bubble columns equipped with vertical 
internals have been reviewed in depth  by Youssef et al.  [8]. Their review reveal ed few 
investigations of the effect of heat -exchang ing tubes ( i.e., vertical interna ls) on the 
hydrodynamics of these columns , showing more experimental data is needed on this 
subject . Recently, Basha et al.  [19]  also reviewed and summarized current  experimental 163 
 
and modeling works conducted in bubble/slurry bubble columns , and recommended that 
further experimental studies be conducted  to address the effect of the cooling tubes 
arrangements on the hydrodynamics of these reactors.  
To design and scal e up high -performance bubble/slurry bubble columns  equipped  
with heat -exchanging tubes, the gas holdup  distribution  is one of the most crucia l 
hydrodynamic parameters because  the gas phase dictat es the fluid dynamics of these 
reactors. The gas holdup distribution turns the liquid or the slurry (liquid -solid) phase 
circulation and controls the movement and mixing of the liquid/slurry ; consequent ly, it 
governs the mixing  characteristics  and the mass and heat transfer rates , in essence,  the 
overall performance of these reactors  [20,21] . However, only a small number of 
experimental studies account  for the effects of the se vertical cooling tube bundle on the gas 
holdup  distribution  [22,23] .  
Among these few studies,  Yamashita  [24] investigated the impacts of vertical pipes 
and rods on the overall  gas holdup in three bubble column diameters ( i.e., 0.08, 0.16, and 
0.31 m) using  an air-water  system . The experimental results indicate d an increase in the 
magnitude of the overall  gas holdup as the number of tubes an d their sizes  increased , while 
the overall gas holdup  decrease d with reduc tions  in the distance between the internals . 
Saxena et al.  [25] also employed a 12-inch ( 0.305 -m) diameter bubble column 
equipped with internals blocking  1.9, 2.7, and 14.3% of the total cross -sectional area 
(TCSA) of the column to address the impacts of the vertical internals on the overall gas 
holdup for an air-water -glass beads system. It was found  that the overall gas holdup in the 
slurry bubble column equipped with 37 tubes ( occupying 14.3% of the TCSA  of the 
column ) was higher than  that of the column  with seven  tubes ( blocking 2.7% of the TCSA  164 
 
of the column ). Nevertheless , the overall gas holdup , as in the aforementioned studies , is 
considered a global parameter , and hence , provides no information about  how the vertical 
internal tubes  affect  the phase distributions and flow pattern inside bubble/slurry bubble 
column reactors . 
Chen et al.  [26] were the first group that applied  gamma -ray computed tomography 
(CT) to investigate the effect of the vertical internals on  the gas holdup distribution in an 
18-inch ( 0.44 m ) bubble column for air -water and air -drakeoil  systems  at superficial gas 
velocities with a range  of 0.02-0.1 m/s that were calculated based on the TCSA of the 
column . The internals bundle represent ed the process of li quid-phase methanol (LPMeOH) 
synthesis , where it occupied 5% of the TCSA  of the reactor. Their results showed that the 
existence of the vertical internals cause d a slight increase (about 10%) in the gas holdup  at 
the core region of the column. In addition , the experimental data reveal ed that the gas 
holdup  distribution was axisymmetric in the fully developed flow region for systems in 
bubble columns both with and without internals. Moreover, the measured gas ho ldup for 
the air -drakeoil system was lower than the gas holdup for the air -water system due to the 
former system having  a much higher viscosity than the latter.  This leads to the form ation  
large bubbles that have higher bubble rise velocities , which cause s a decrease in the 
residence time of the gas (bubbles) as compared with the small bubbles in an air-water 
system.  However, the ra nge of superficial gas velocity used in this study was low (not 
deeply into the churn turbulent flow regime) ; hence , they did not address and evaluate the 
effect of the vertical internal tubes on the gas holdup distributions and their profiles at high 
superficial gas velocit ies, which is of industrial interest in achieving high v olumetric 
productivity in these reactors.  Additionally, t he bundle of vertical internals used in their 165 
 
work obstructed a low fraction of the bubble column, which did not reflect the presence of 
the dense heat -exchanging tubes that are employed  in high exothermic reactions as 
mentioned earlier. Fu rthermore, the obtained increas e in the gas holdup magnitude for the 
bubble column with vertical internals could not be explained only by the presence of these 
internals, but by the fact that the  superficial gas velocities were calculated on the basis of 
the TCSA  of the column , where a similar amount of the gas phase (air) was only applied 
to the column with vertical internal tubes. Therefore , the existence of vertical inte rnal tubes 
in the bubble column reduce d the cross -sectional area of the flow and subs equently 
increase d the interstitial gas velocity in the column, which eventually caused an increase  
in the magnitude of the gas holdup.  
There is a lack of modeling and simulation of bubble columns equipped with 
vertical tubes due to the high complexity of the multiphase flow in these reactors, especially 
when they are equipped with dense vertical internals . Among  the very few simulation 
studies, Larachi et al. [27] built 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation s for 
five pilot -scale  plant bubble columns  (1 m in diameter) , with and without vertical internals , 
for an air-water system at a superficial gas velocity  of 0.12 m/s to investigate the impacts 
of these tubes on the flow pattern in these columns.  Their simulation s howed that the 
configurations of the tube bundle s significant ly affected the flow  pattern of the bubble 
columns. This impact was particularly remarkable when the tubes  were non -uniformly 
arranged  over the cross -sectional area of the column. However, these simulation results for 
bubble columns with internals were not validated and compared against any benchmark 
experimental data because there is little experimental data for bubble columns equipped 
with bundle of heat -exchanging tube s. 166 
 
Youssef and Al -Dahhan [28] for the first time used a 4-point  fiber  optical probe 
technique to assess the effects of the vertical internals bundle on the local gas holdup  
profiles in an 8-inch (0.2 -m) diameter bubble column for an air-water system at  superficial 
gas velocities  of 0.03-0.2 m/s, which were computed based on the  TCSA  of the column . 
These  internals cover ed 5% and 22% of the TCSA  of the column to represent  the heat -
exchanging tubes employed in industrial LPMeOH and FT processes , respectively . Their 
findings revealed  that internals covering 5% of  the TCSA  had no significant effect  on the 
gas holdup , while internals cover ing 22% of the TCSA  of the column  led to a significant 
increase in the gas holdup  magnitude.  
Balamurugan et al.  [29] enhanced the overall gas holdup in a 6-inch ( 0.15-m) 
bubble column in an  air-water system by designing, developing , and testing helical spring 
as vertical internals. They reported significant increase s of 230% and 150% for the overall 
gas holdup  values in the bubble column operated at superficial gas velocities of 0.12 m/s 
and 0.4 m/s (calculated based on the TCSA  of the column) , respectively.  Additionally, 
they concluded that geometry, the material of construction, and properties of the helical 
spring internals had a significant effect on the overall gas holdup.  
Youssef et al. [30] extended their investigation to a large -scale bubble column (0.44 
m in diameter) equipped with  a bundle of vertical internals  to study the impact of these 
internals  on the local gas holdup profiles in an air-water system under  the churn turbulent 
flow regime ( 0.2, 0.3, and 0.45 m/s of superficial gas velocity  computed based on the TCSA  
of the column ) by using a 4-point fiber optical probe . In this investigation, they used 
different designs of the internals that include d circular (5% of the  TCSA  of the column ) 
and hexagonal (25% of the TCSA  of the column ) arrangements. Analysis of the local gas 167 
 
holdup  data reveal ed that the presence of intense  internals (25% of the  TCSA  of the 
column ) led to a remarkable increase in the magnitude of the local gas holdup  values . 
Guan et al. [31] presented experimental res ults of the gas hol dup profiles measured 
by an electrical resistivity probe in a 0.8 m diameter bubble column equipped with pin fin 
tubes (cover ing 9.2% of the TCSA  of the column ) for an air-water system in a wide range 
of superficial gas velocities ( 0.08-0.62 m/s  calculated based on the free cross -sectional area 
[FCSA ] of the flow ). The authors observed that the presence of the pin fin tubes increase d 
the overall gas holdup and alter ed the local gas holdup  profiles. Also, they reported that 
the height of the distributor region decreased  in the presence of the pin fin tubes. Mo reover, 
arranging the internals non-uniform ly over the cross -sectional area of the column ( having 
removed two internals) cause d strong  gas short -circuiting , even without downward liquid 
flow. 
Kagumba and Al -Dahhan  [32] examined the influence of differ ent sizes and 
configurations of vertical tubes on the local gas holdup in a 5.5-inch (0.14 -m) inner 
diameter Plexiglas ® bubble column with and without internals at a wide range of 
superficial gas velocities ( 0.03-0.45 m/s) for an air -water system using a 4-point fiber 
optical probe.  Also in their experimental work, they investigated the effect of using a 
superficial gas velocity that was calcula ted based on the TCSA  and FCSA  of the column 
on the overall and local gas holdup in a bubble column equipped with vertical internal 
tubes. Two sizes of internals  (0.0127 and 0.0254  m in diameter) were  employed , where  
both sizes  of the inter nals were designed to occupy 25 % of the TCSA  of the column to 
simulate industrial FT reactor ’s heat-exchanging tubes . The overall and local gas holdup at 
the center of the column significantly increased in the bubble columns eq uipped with 168 
 
vertical internal tubes when these columns operated at a superficial gas velocity calculated 
based on the TCSA  of the column . Additionally,  compared to the column without vertical 
internals,  the local gas holdup values were higher in bubble column equipped with 0.0127 
m vertical internals operated in the bubbly flow regime, particularly at a superficial gas 
velocity of 0.03 m/s computed based on the FCSA  of the flow.  Moreover , size of the  
vertical internals was insignificant in affecting the gas holdup  values  when the bubble 
columns with vertical internals operated at a high superficial  gas velocity ( 0.45 m/s), which 
was calculated based on the FCSA  of the flow . Furthermore , the gas holdup values obtained 
in the bubble column without internals can be extrapolated  to a column equipped with 
internals  if it operates at superficial gas velocities calculated based on  the FCSA  of the 
flow. However,  in this work,  the vertical internals were  designed differently for each size 
of internals. For example, the 0.0127 m internals were  arranged in a hexagonal shape , while 
the 0.0254 m  internals  were arranged in a circular shape. Hence, the change in the 
magnitude of the local gas holdup  profiles might  have been caused by the different 
configuration of the internals, not by the difference in the size of the internals. Therefore, 
further investigations are needed to determine which variable was  responsible for th e 
change in the local gas holdup  value s.  
Jasim [33] investigate d the effect of internals configurations  and their size on the 
gas holdup measured in the same experimental setup and conditions as Kagumba and Al -
Dahhan  [32]. He designed and developed a circular configuration for 0 .5-inch (0.0127 -m) 
internals , where all the internals were  arranged and distributed uniformly across the CSA  
of the column to compare it with the hexagonal configuration to assess the impact of the 
configurations (i.e., circular and hexagonal) on the gas h oldup . To investigate the impact 169 
 
of the size of the internals Jasim [33] compared ed the gas holdup values measured with 
0.5-inch (0.0127 -m) and 1 -inch (0.0254 -m) internals arranged in a circular shape , 
conclud ing that the 0.5 -inch (0.0127 -m) internals with a circular configuration g ave 
symmetric gas holdup  profiles along the diamet er of the column , while the 0.5 -inch 
(0.0127 -m) internals with the hexagonal arrangement led to a distinct asymmetric gas 
holdup  diameter profi le. Also, the 1 -inch (0.0254 -m) internals enhanced the local gas 
holdup at the wall region more than  the 0.5-inch internals arranged in a circular shape.  
Recently, to investigate and quantify the influence of these tubes on the cross -
sectional gas holdup distributions and their radial profiles , Al-Mesfer et al. [34] employed 
for the first time an advanced gamma -ray computed tomography (CT) technique for 
scanning a 6 -inch (0.1524 -m O. D.) Plexiglas® bubble column equipped with intense heat -
exchanging tubes (about 25% of the TCSA of the reactor), representing the Fische r-
Tropsch synthesis (FTS) reactor’s internals. These vertical internal tubes were arranged in 
a hexagonal -like shape, with a pitch of 21 mm over the CSA of the bubble column. They 
used an air -water system with a broad range of superficial gas velocities (0 .05-0.45 m/s), 
calculated based on the total and free CSAs. Thus, they demonstrated the effect of the 
manner in which the superficial gas velocity is calculated, compared to columns without 
vertical internals. The CT scan images showed that the gas holdup distributions were 
symmetrical (uniform) over the CSA in the bubble column without internals but 
asymmetrical (nonuniform) at higher superficial gas velocities (0.3 and 0.45 m/s) for a 
bubble column with internals. Also, gas holdup values increased signifi cantly when the 
bubble column operated at superficial gas velocities that were calculated based on the 
TCSA of the reactor, while little effect was noticed when the same superficial gas velocities 170 
 
were computed based on the FCSA of the flow. Another key fi nding was that the overall 
and local gas holdup results under a churn turbulent flow regime in the column without 
vertical internal tubes could be extrapolated to those reactors with vertical internal tubes if 
the superficial gas velocity based on the FCSA  of the flow was applied to those column s 
with vertical internal tubes.  
Thus far, the influence of dense heat -exchanging tubes configurations on the gas 
holdup distribution s and their profiles has not been investigated, and whether the presence 
of differe nt design s of vertical internal tubes affect s the gas-liquid  distribution over the 
entire cross -sectional area of the bubble column remains an open question. Therefore, this 
work aims to target this issue for the first time by investigating the effects of tube 
configurations on the gas-liquid  distribution and their  profiles at different superficial gas 
velocit ies (particularly at the high superficial gas velocit ies of 0.2 and 0.45 m/s calculated 
based on the FCSA of the column) by using advanced gamma -ray computed tomography. 
The particular goals of this work were t o (1) visualize and quantify the effect of  the 
internals configurations on  the gas holdup distribution s and their profiles; (2) examine the 
effect of the superficial gas velocity on the gas holdup distribution s and their profiles, and 
(3) identify which configuration provides a better  distribution of the gas holdup  over the 
entire CSA  of the column .The knowledge  gained by conducting this research will  improve 
the level of fundamental understanding of the effect of the design of heat -exchanging tubes 
on the gas holdup distributions in a bubble column. Also, the obtained experimental results 
will enlarge the database related to  bubble column s with vertical internal tubes , such that 
they can then be used  to evaluate and validate 3 -D CFD simulations . 171 
 
2. EXPERIMENTAL WORK AND MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE  
2.1. BUBBLE COLUMN  SETUP  
The Plexiglas ® bubble column used in this study has an outer  diameter of 6 inches 
(0.1524 m) and a height of 72 inches (1.83 m ). The s chematic diagram of bubble column 
equipped  with vertical internals display s in Figure 1. The fluids used i n the present work  
are dry air as the continuous gas phase , whereas purified water  (i.e., provided by a reverse 
osmosis water filtration system ) was employed as the liquid phase in batch mode.  
According to the most recent hydrodynamic study  [35], which was conducted in a counter -
current gas -liquid bubble column with two vertical internal tubes, operating the bubble 
column in counter -current mode for the liquid phase causes a significant increase  in the gas 
holdup magnitude , while also decreasing the bubble velocity. Therefore, it would be 
interesting in future  work to study the influence of vertical internals and their 
configurations on the gas holdup distribution when these columns operate under  co-current 
or counter -current modes. For easier comparison to the literature, this study used an air -
water system. The air was fed continuously to two calibrated flow meters  connected in 
parallel  to cover a wide  range of superficial gas velocities. The gas enter ed the bubble 
column at the bottom of a plenum 0.3 -m in height , was sparged through a perforated plate 
(gas distributor) , and dispersed continuously in the form of bubbles in the  bulk of  the liquid 
phase. The gas distributor was stainless steel , with 121 holes , each 1.32 mm in diameter , 
distributed uniformly in a triangular pitch and offering 1.09% of the open area as exhibited 
in Figure 1.  172

The dimensions of the column (H  = 1.83 m, and D  = 0.1524  m), aspect ratio 
(H/D=12), and gas distributor design (hole diameter  = 1.32 mm) indicate that the gas 
holdup distribution and their profiles were  independent of the column and g as distributor 
design , according to Wilkinson et al.  [36], who reported that the gas holdup depends on the 
gas distributor design if the distributor holes are greater than 1 mm (i.e., coarse gas 
distributor). Additionally , Ong et al. [37] stated that under the churn turbulen t flow regime 
(i.e., the condition of the current study), the influence of the gas distributor design with 
various  sizes of holes (0.4, 0.5, and 1.25 mm) on the gas holdup distribution was negligible.  
 Three configurations of vertical internal tubes (i.e., hexagonal and circular without 
a central tube, and circular with a central tube) were employed in this work, as shown in 
Figure 2. Both the hexagonal and circular without central tube configurations consist ed of 
30 of vertical internal tubes while circular with central tube comprises 31 of 0.5 -inch 
(0.0127 -m) Plexiglas ® vertical internal tubes . These vertical internals tubes  covered 25% 
of the TCSA  of the column to represent  the same area that was occupied by industrial heat -
exchanging tubes in FT synthesis  [38–40]. The vertical internals  in the  hexagonal 
configuration were arranged in a triangular pitch of 2.1 cm over the CSA  of the column , 
while the vertical internals  of the circular configuration were organized  in three concentric 
circles of 1-cm, 3.5-cm, and 5.5-cm diameters . Also, one tube was inserted vertically in the 
center of t he circular configuration to assess the effect  of adding a central tube on the gas 
holdup distributions. In this investigation, the internals for all configurations were housed 
and fixed vertically inside the column with a 3-inch (0.076 -m) distance (i.e., the gap 
between the internals and the distributor) from the gas distributor , using three 
spacers/supports  as well as the head plate , to prevent the vibration of the vertical internals  174 
 
during the operation of the bubble columns.  All experiments were conducted at ambient 
conditions  as well as at the constant dynamic level of the gas-liquid  dispersion (1.6 m abo ve 
the distributor, H/D = 10.3, where H = dynamic level and D = diameter) . Therefore, the 
initial liquid levels varied according to the studied superficial gas velocities. For example, 
the initial liquid height above  the gas distributor in the bubble colum ns without internals , 
which  operated at the superficial gas velocities 0.2 and 0.45 m/s was 1.1 and 0.92 m 
respectively , while the height  was 1 and 0. 85 m for the columns with internals operating at 
the same superficial gas velocities but calculated based on the free CSA of the flow.  
According to the dynamic level (H) and diameter (D) of the column used in this study, the 
bubble columns with and without vertical internals were operated with the aspect rat io (i.e., 
H/D) of 10.5 , which is greater than the critical aspect ratio (5 -10) [41] to ensure  that the 
measured gas holdup distributions and their profiles were  not influenced by the column 
size and the gas distributor design  [42]. 
Depending on the nature of the industri al process, bubble columns can be operated 
in different flow regimes such as bubbly (homogeneous) and churn turbulent 
(heterogeneous) flow regimes. For example, the bubble columns in biochemical 
applications are operated in a bubbly flow regime , while they operat e in the churn turbulent 
flow regime in a highly exothermic process  [43]. A bubbly flow regime occurs at a low gas 
flow rate , and it is characterized by small uniform bubbles (i.e., no interaction and 
coalescence between bubbles)  [44], while the churn turbulent flow regime occurs at a high 
gas flow rate and is characterized by the presence of a wide range of bubble size  distribution  
(i.e., severe coalescence and break -up between bubbles).

vertical internal tubes  
 
The cross -sectional gas holdup distributions and their profiles were measured  at the 
churn turbulent flow regime, particularly at 0.2 and 0.45 m/s  superficial gas velocities. 
These superficial gas velocities were  selected  based  on simulating industr ial interest 
conditions , which  usually employ high superficial gas velocities (typically in the 
heterogeneous  regime) to achieve high productivity  [45–47]. It is important to note that the 
superficial gas velocity of the bubble column without vertical internal tubes  was calculated 
based on the TCSA of the column , while it was computed based on the FCSA  of the flow 
in the case of the bubble column equipped with bundles  of internals . The FCSA  of the flow 
was calculated  as follows:

It is important to mention that the static pressure inside the bubble column decreases 
when the gas flows upward  (i.e., the gas expands). As a result, the  superficial gas velocity 
could vary with the elevation of the bubble column [48]. However, due to experimental 
limitation s, it was not possible to quantify the change in the superficial gas velocity in 
relation to column's height. Therefore, the superficial gas was calculated based on the  
empty column (i.e., the column not filled with  water).  
All the gas-liquid  distributions and their  diametrical  profile measurements were 
performed  at one axial level (L/D  = 5.1) in the fully developed  flow region where the gas 
holdup did not change axially for the bubble column without vertical internals  [37,49] . 
Additionally, a recent hydrodynamic study  [50]  was conducted  in a bubble column (0.1 m 
inner diameter) with vertical internals using ultrafast X -ray tomography to assess the effect 
of the internals layout on the gas holdup and bubble size distributions under bubbly and 
churn turbulent flow regimes.  
 In this study, the author scanned the column at three  axial heights (H/D = 0.04, 5, 
and 7) to identify the height  of the  fully developed flow regime (i.e., equilibrium region) 
at two superficial gas velocities (i.e., 0.02 and 0.1 m/s).  
 The gas holdu p and  bubble size distributions in the fully developed flow regime 
reached an axial height from H/D  = 5 to H/D  = 7 (which is the same axial CT scan level 
used in  the current study) in bubbly (i.e., at 0.2 m/s) and churn turbulent (i.e., 0.1 m/s) flow 
regimes  where the gas holdup and bubble size distributions were  found  to be  independent 
of the axial level within the fully developed flow region.

2.2.  GAMMA -RAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT)  
A novel dual -source gamma -ray computed tomography (CT) technique was 
designed , developed, and validated by Varma  [51] to visualize and quantify the phase 
holdup distribution in three phases  flowing in a multiphase flow system in a nondestructive 
way. This CT technique which is currently available at Multiphase Reactors Engineering 
and Applications Laboratory (mReal) in the Chemical and Biochemical Engineering 
Department, Missouri University of Scienc e and Technology (Missouri S&T) was 
successfully implemented for imaging and measuring the phase distributions in different 
multiphase reactors including very dense systems ( with high attenuation materials), opaque 
system s (with high gas holdup), and large -scale columns (up to 0.46 m, ). Examples of 
these impl ementations of this CT scanner  are visualiz ed, and quantifi ed of void fraction 
distribution in pebble bed  [52], gas holdup distribution in  a bubble  column  [53], solid  and 
gas holdups  distribution in spouted  [54,55]  and fluidized beds  [56], etc. A photo and 
schematic diagram of the CT technique u sed in the present study are illustrated  in Figure 3 
and Figure 4. This CT scanner is composed of two gamma -ray encapsulated sources, 
namely cesium (137Cs, with initial  activity of ~ 250 mCi) and cobalt (60Co with initial 
activity of ~ 50 mCi) , which  are well sealed and shielded by lead and tungsten containers , 
respectively , developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) . For each of these 
gamma -ray sources, there are 15 sodium iodide (NaI) detectors, which  are located  
corresponding to each source with a distance of 1 .2 m from the source  as shown in Figure 
3. In the present study, only a single gamma -ray source (137Cs, with 662 keV photon 
energy ), which is a part of this technique , was used to visualize and quantify the cross -
sectional gas holdup distributions and their diametrical profiles in bubble colum ns with 178 
 
and without a bundle of heat -exchanging  tubes. The 137Cs source  was collimated by  
installing  a window in the lead collimator to form a fan beam of gamma photons 5 mm in 
height and 40o in width , oriented toward the detectors.

These detectors were also collimated with lead , where each collimator ha d an open 
rectangular area (2 mm × 5 mm ) to receive and record only the lines (bea ms) of gamma 
rays that passed through this open slit , thus reducing the effects of gamma scattering  [57]. 
The collimated 137Cs source and its array of detectors were  installed on a stainless steel 
rotating  circular plate that was connected from the bottom to a fixed square plate. These 
plates ha d a circular opening 30 inches (0.75 m) in diameter dedicated for objects to be 
scanned.  These square and circular  plates could  be moved axially to scan the objects  along 
their heights to provide 2 -D cross -sectional images  at specific axial elevations . The

capability to move up or down  enable d this CT technique to create a 3-D image of the 
phase distribution if many scans were taken  along the column’s height , allowing for scans 
at various axial levels up to 2.75 m in height and 0.75 m in diameter. A detailed description 
of the hardware and software used in this CT technique can be found elsewhere [51]. 
During CT scanning of the bubble columns in the presence and absence of the 
vertical internals , the col limated 137Cs source sho t narrow beams of gamma -rays as it 
rotate d automatically around the column using a stepping motor that control led the angular 
movement (view) of the circular plate. For each view of rotation (137Cs source position), 
the array of detectors , which are located  opposite the source , also moved automatically  
through  21 fine steps (detector positions or projections) at an angle of 0.13° from the 137Cs 
source using another independent stepping motor. Thus, for a complete scan (360o), this  
CT technique offer s 197 views , and for each of those  view s, there are a 315  (21 step × 15 
detectors) projections. As a result, more than 62 ,000 projections pass through the column 
at different angles. As these projections of gamma -rays, pass through the c olumn, they are 
recorded and transmitted to the computer as counts. These counts were acquired  with a 
sampling rate of 60 samples of data at a frequency of 10 Hz, with a full scan requiring 8.5 
hours . The acquired projections  data are usually processed by a computer using a number 
of reconstruction algorithms such as Fourier transform (FT)  [58], back projection (BP)  
[59], filtered back projection (FBP)  [60], simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique 
(SIRT)  [61], expectation maximization (EM)  [62], and alternating minimization [63], to 
reconstruct the linear attenuation coefficients  (μ, cm-1) distribution  of the medium that was 
scanned.  Among these reconstruction algorithms, the EM algorithm has been widely used  
to reconstruct  the phase distributions of various  multiphase  reactors  [37,64,65] . 180

 However, the AM algorithm, developed by O ’Sullivan and Benac [63] and applied  
and introduced  successfully by Varma [51] to create images of the phase distribution , is 
currently used instead of the EM algorithm because  the AM algorithm exhibit s overall  
better  enhancement in the quality of images , according to the comparative  study performed 
by V arma et al.  [66]. Therefore, i n the present work, the AM algorithm was implemented 
to reconstruct all phase distributions images in the bubble columns in the presence and 
absence of vertical internals . 
The experimental steps  for scanning the bubble column without vertical internal 
tubes is as follows:  
• Perform a scan without the column between the 137Cs source and its detectors to 
obtain a reference scan  (𝐼°). 
• Conduct a scan of the column filled only with water to get (𝐼𝑙); then, calculat e the 
transmission ratio (𝐼𝑙𝐼°⁄) to find  𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗, as follows : 
𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗=𝜇𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗 (2) 
• Scan the bubble column without vertical internals operated at the studied superficial 
gas velocity (𝐼𝑔˗𝑙); then, comput e the transmission ratio (𝐼𝑔˗𝑙𝐼°⁄) to determine   
𝐴𝑔˗𝑙,𝑖𝑗, as follows:  
 𝐴𝑔˗𝑙,𝑖𝑗=𝜇𝑔˗𝑙,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗 (3) 
In contrast,  the experimental procedure for scanning a bubble column equipped 
with vertical internal tubes is as follows:  
• Perform a scan without the column as a reference scan (𝐼°). 
• Conduct  a scan for the column without vertical internals  and only filled with water 
to get (𝐼𝑙); then, calculat e the transmission ratio ( 𝐼𝑙𝐼°⁄) to determine 𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗 .  182 
 
• Scan the column equipped with vertical  internal tubes and filled with water (𝐼𝑙,𝑠); 
then, find the transmission ratio ( 𝐼𝑙,𝑠𝐼°⁄) to calculate  𝐴𝑙˗𝑠,𝑖𝑗; as follows:   
𝐴𝑙˗𝑠,𝑖𝑗=𝜇𝑙˗𝑠,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗 (4) 
Scan the column with vertical  internal tubes operated at the studied superficial gas 
velocity (𝐼𝑔,𝑙,𝑠) and then finding the transmission ratio ( 𝐼𝑔,𝑙,𝑠𝐼°⁄) to calculate  𝐴𝑔˗𝑙˗𝑠,𝑖𝑗 .  
𝐴𝑔˗𝑙˗𝑠,𝑖𝑗=𝜇𝑔˗𝑙˗𝑠,𝑖𝑗𝐿𝑖𝑗 (5) 
After scanning the bubble columns with and without vertical internal tubes 
according to the above experimental steps , the transmission ratios for the individual scan s 
were initially  calculated based on the reference scan s. Then , these transmission ratios were 
fed as input data for the alternating minimization (AM) algorithm to reconstruct the linear 
attenuation coefficients for each scan separately. Subsequently, the local gas holdup 
distributions in bubble columns with and with out vertical internals were  calculated using  
the following equations.  
𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗=1−𝐴𝑔˗𝑙,𝑖𝑗
𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗=1−(𝜇𝑔˗𝑙,𝑖𝑗
𝜇𝑙,𝑖𝑗) (6) 
To calculate  the local gas holdup in the bubble column equipped with vertical 
internal tubes , use Eq. 7: 
𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗=𝐴𝑙˗𝑠,𝑖𝑗 − 𝐴𝑔˗𝑙˗𝑠,𝑖𝑗
𝐴𝑙,𝑖𝑗=𝜇𝑙˗𝑠,𝑖𝑗 − 𝜇𝑔˗𝑙˗𝑠,𝑖𝑗
𝜇𝑙,𝑖𝑗  (7) 
where  𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗 represents the local gas holdup in each pixel for the bubble column with and 
without vertical internal  tubes ; 𝜇𝑔˗𝑙,𝑖𝑗 is the  linear attenuation  coefficient  of the gas-liquid  
in each pixel (cm-1); 𝜇𝑙,𝑖𝑗 is the  linear attenuation coefficient of the liquid without vertical 
internals in each pixel (cm-1); 𝜇𝑙˗𝑠,𝑖𝑗 is the  linear attenuation coefficient of the liquid -solid 183 
 
in each pixel (cm-1); and 𝜇𝑔˗𝑙˗𝑠,𝑖𝑗 is the  linear attenuation  coefficient  of the gas-liquid -solid 
in each pixel (cm-1). Further processing of the gas holdup distributions by removing the 
values of the vertical internals from the gas holdup distributions produce d azimuthally  and 
line-averaged gas holdup profiles.  
 More details about the method of calculating  gas holdup  based on the linear 
attenuation coefficients as well as the scan procedures for bubble columns  with and without 
internals  and the approach of exclu ding the vertical internals from  the gas holdup 
distribution can be found in our previous publications. Recently we have validated this CT 
technique by scanning different cases of Plexiglas ® phantom  and have  verified the 
reliability of this CT  technique  to vis ualize and quantify the phase distributions with high 
precision.  
This CT technique has another feature that can also work as a gamma -ray 
densitometry (GRD) technique to measure (1) the line -averaged phase holdup, (2) identify 
flow regimes, (3) detect the maldistribution of phases, and (4) monitor and characterize the 
flow pattern of multiphase reactors by fixing (not rotating) the 137Cs source and using only 
the middle detector, which is positioned opposite the center of the 137Cs source  [67]. 
2.3. THE ACCURACY AND REPRODUCIBILITY OF CT SCANS  
Before scanning the bubble columns with and without vertical internals tubes , 
phantom  (i.e., two concentric Plexiglas ® cylinders)  scanning was performed to adjust all 
the electronics, detectors, and related parameters to ensure the reliability of the techniqu e 
and readiness for measurement at the desired conditions . Additionally, the accuracy of the 
CT results was checked and confirmed through various  scanning cases for the phantom 
(i.e., empty phantom ; the inner cylinder filled with water , while the outer cylinder was 184 
 
empty)  and the linear attenuation was reconstructed for different cases of the phantom. 
Compared to the theoretical values, the measured linear attenuation coefficient of water, 
air, and Plexiglas ® were within 2.3%  [34,52] . Then, to check the reliability of the CT 
measurements, the reproducibility of the measurement was evaluated for the cross -
sectional gas holdup distributions and their profiles. Therefore, in th e present study, CT 
scans were  conducted at the axial level of the fully developed  flow region ( H/D = 5.1) for 
the 6-inch bubble column  without vertical internal tubes  under two operating conditions 
(0.05 and 0.45 m/s  superficial gas velocities). For each superficial gas velocity, the CT 
scan was repeated twice  on two successive days , and the  cross -sectional gas holdup and its 
diametrical profiles  were constructed  as shown in  Figure 5 and Figure 6. As can be noted  
these figures, the obtained gas holdups  for two replications (run s No.1 and 2) of each 
condition ( 0.05 and 0.45 m/s) were  identical qualitatively and quantitatively . To quantify 
the difference between the gas holdup profiles, the statistical difference in terms of the 
average absolute relative d ifference (AARD) was calculated using the following equation:  
𝐴𝐴𝑅𝐷 =1
𝑁∑|𝜀1(𝑟)−𝜀2(𝑟)
𝜀1(𝑟)|𝑁
1 (8) 
where 𝜀1(𝑟) and 𝜀2(𝑟) represent the gas holdup values of experiment s No. 1 and 2, 
respectively , at the corresponding dimensionless radi al positions . N represents the number 
of data points along the radius of the column . It was found that the AARD  in the percentage 
between the gas holdup profiles for a superficial gas velocity of 0.05 and 0.45 m/s was 
approximately  2.62% and 1 .74%, respectively.  These outcomes display  the attainment of 
excellent  reproduc ibility, thus, confirm ing the reliability of the CT technique and its 
capability to reproduce gas holdup  measurements. Thus , there was no need to replicate 185 
 
many scans. However, in this work , all the gas holdup profiles were based on an averag e 
of two repeated measurements (two scans) of the gas holdup . The error bars were plotted 
in all subsequent diametrical profiles, but they cannot be seen  clearly due to their small 
values , which lie within the data points along the diameter of the columns.

Moreover, the mean s of the cross -sectional gas holdup distribution for the bubble 
column without vertical internals operated at superficial gas velocities of 0.05 and 0.45 m/s 
were calculated and compared with the overall gas holdup for the same operating 
conditions to check the acc uracy of the measured gas holdup data using the  CT technique .

The overall gas holdup was measured using the bed expansion method and calculated based 
on the change in the bed height as follows:  
𝑂𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑙  𝑔𝑎𝑠 ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑢𝑝

The relative differences between the mean of the cross -sectional gas holdup and the 
overall gas holdup obtained by  the bed expansion technique were  3.6% and 4 .1% for the 
superficial gas velocities of 0.05 and 0.45 m/s, respectively.  In terms of validating the CT 
technique, the reproducibility of the CT data, and its comparison with another independent 
method, these results confirmed the validity and reliability of the CT measurements for 
bubble columns with and without vertical internals .  
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
An analysis of t he results of the time-averaged cross -sectional gas holdup 
distributions, azimuthally and line-averaged gas holdup  profiles, and the extent of the gas 
holdup dispersion over the entire CSA of the column  are presented  in this section. The 
cross -sectional gas holdup distributions and their profiles were obtained by scanning at  the 
fully developed flow region (L/D  = 5.1) with four configurations of bubble columns, 
including bubble columns without vertical internals and bubble column s with three 
arrangements of vertical internal tubes (hexagonal, circular without a central tube, and 
circular with an extra central tube) operated the under churn turbulent flow regime 
(particularly at superficial gas velocit ies of 0.2 and 0.45 m/s) . These results are analyzed 
and discussed in more detail in the following subsections.  188 
 
3.1. VISUALIZING THE EFFECTS OF THE PRESENCE OF THE VERTICAL 
INTERNALS AND THEIR CONFIGURATION DESIGNS ON THE GAS 
HOLDUP DISTRIBUTIONS  
Figure 7 displays the reconstructed time-averaged cross -sectional gas holdup 
distributions for all four studied bubble column configurations and superficial gas velocity . 
The color bar of these figure s represents the magnitude of the gas holdup in each pixel, 
where the red color marks more gas, whereas the blue color means less ga s holdup ( more 
liquid  holdup ). The gas holdup distributions  for bubble columns with vertical internals  of 
different configurations  were  entirely dissimilar , despite  their use of the same size vertical 
internal tubes and the same percentage of the occluded CSA  (about 25% of the TCSA of 
the column) occupied by vertical internal tubes. This dissimilarity coul d result from using 
different geometric configurations of vertical internal tubes and their inter -tube gaps 
(spaces among vertical internals). Additionally, it is evident from the gas holdup 
distribution images that the presence of the vertical internal tu bes and their arrangements 
alter the quality of the gas -liquid distribution over the CSA of the columns. Moreover, the 
CT technique was capable of visualizing qualitatively the gas and liquid phase behavior 
over the entire CSA of the columns as well as cap turing the local variation of the gas holdup 
with superficial gas velocities in bubble columns in the presence and absence of a bundle 
of vertical internal tubes.  The time -averaged cross -sectional gas holdup distributions 
present  in Figure 7 clearly  exhibit almost symmetric gas holdup distributions in bubble 
columns without vertical internals  for all studied superficial gas velocities. On the other 
hand, the symmetric gas holdup distribution s do not occur  in the bubble column s equipped 
densely with vertical internal tubes.

 However, the bubble column with vertical internals  arranged circularly with the 
extra  central tube had distinct asymmetric gas holdup distributions. This asymmetric (non -
homogen eous spread of the gas phase over the CSA of the column ) of the gas holdup  
distribution tend ed to increase as the superficial gas velocity rose. In addition , the well -
known phenomen on in bubble column without internals, where  there is more gas at the 
center and less gas near the wall region of the column , still occur red in the bubble column 
equipped with an intense bundle of vertical internals (blocking  about  25% of the TCSA  of 
the column) for all studied configurations. Howev er, the gas holdup distributions var ied 
according to the configuration used in these columns, and that means the large liquid 
circulation will be different. Therefore, further experimental investigations are necessary 
to address this issue, especially  since there is no local liquid velocity data available in the 
literature for bubble column equipped with dense vertical internals  arranged in different 
configurations ; this is under consideration in our laboratory and will be the subject of future 
manuscripts . 
Moreover, t he presence of the vertical internal tubes  enhance d the gas holdup near 
the wall region  because the hexagonal and circular arrangement s of these tubes  spread s 
more gas towards the wall region. However, this enhancement  was more pronounced for  
bubble column with  a hexagonal arrange ment  of vertical internals because  that 
arrangement  provided  the most  clearance area  (no vertical tubes were  present in this area)  
between the bundle of internal tubes  and the wall of the column. This clearance space could 
facilitate and allow for the accumulation of small bubbles because small bubbles have a 
lower bubble rise velocity than large bubbles. As a result, the residence time of the bubbles 
increased, causing increases in the gas holdup.  Furthermore, the CT images disclose that 191 
 
 
 the existence of an extra central tube with a circular configuration reduced the gas holdup 
magnitude at the center of the column by pushing the gas out of this area. However, the 
absence of the central tube caused  a remarkable increase in the gas holdup in this area, as 
shown in the circular configuration without a central vertical tube. This new and unusual 
finding needs to be considered in designing heat -exchanging tubes of pilot and commercial 
bubble/slurry bubb le column reactors.  
Qualitatively, the gas holdup distribution images revealed that the bubble column 
with vertical tubes arranged in a hexagonal shape provided more even (homogeneously 
distributed over the CSA of the column) gas holdup distributions over the entire CSA of 
the column than other configurations. From an industrial point of view, this finding is 
significant because the cross -sectional distribution of the gas holdup and liquid flow field 
and its circulation affect the quality and efficiency of the chemical reaction; hence, reactor 
performance is affected due to the contact between gas -liquid or gas -slurry phases in 
bubble/slurry bubble columns. These differences in the cross -sectional gas holdup 
distributions are mainly caused by the arrangement s of the vertical internal tubes, whose 
diametrical profiles are quantified in the following section.  
The reconstructed cross -sectional gas holdup distributions for bubble column 
without vertical internals  are qualitatively in agreement with those obtained  in the  
experiments using the  same system (air -water)  and reported in the literature  [34,68,69] . 
However, the reconstructed gas holdup distributions  images  for bubble co lumns equipped 
with a bundle of vertical internal tubes  arranged in different configurations have never  
before  been  reported . Therefore, these results add to the body of knowledge  about the effect 
of heat-exchanging  tubes on  the gas-liquid  structure over the CSA  of a bubble column. In 192 
 
 
 addition , these experimental results serve  as baseline data for the future assessment and 
validation of CFD simulations and phenomenological models towards better prediction of 
the performance of these reactors.  
3.2. INFLUENCE OF THE PRESENCE OF VERTICAL INTERNALS AND 
THEIR ARRANGEMENTS ON THE AZIMUTHALLY AND LINE -
AVERAGED GAS HOLDUP PROFILES  
The influence of  vertical internal tubes and their configuration s as well as  
superficial gas velocities  on the phases distribut ion was further demonstrated by the  
azimuthally and  line-averages of the gas holdups  in the cross -sectional images that 
illustrate  the diametrical gas holdup  profiles . The azimuthally  averaged diametrical profiles 
for a 2 -D image of the gas holdup distributions were computed by circularly averaging the 
pixel values of the gas holdup image after excluding the values of the tubes from the 
azimuthally and line -averag ed profiles . 
 The methodology used to  exclu de the vertical in ternal tubes  from these profiles 
was described  in more detail in our previous publication. These azimuthally averaged 
profiles and the impacts of the configuration on the gas holdup are displayed  in Figure 8 
and Figure 9 for superficial gas velocities corresponding to the flow in the churn turbulent 
flow regime ( 0.2 and 0.45 m/s).  
These azimuthal profiles  demonstrate  that the gas holdup values near the wall 
region of the column s increase d in the presence of vertical tubes for the studied superficial 
gas velocit ies. However, the bubble column with the hexagonal configuration of tubes 
show ed a noticeable increase in the gas holdup near the wall region , which did not occur 
for the other configurations . For example, using  a superficial gas velocity of 0.45 m/s and 193 
 
 
 at the wall region (dimensionless radius, r/R  = 0.8), an increase of 105% was obtained in 
the bubble column wit h the hexagonal configuration.  
 Additionally, a significant decrease was observed in the gas holdup values at the 
center of the column with the tubes arranged hexagonal ly. The possible cause  of this 
phenomenon  is the presence of  the vertical internal tubes  that enhance the  bubbles ’ break -
up rate under the  churn turbulent flow regime inside the bubble column , which  hinders the 
lateral movement of the bubbles. Consequently, the vertical internals allow only for smaller 
bubbles (smaller than the space between the vertical internals) to move radially toward the 
wall region , while  these internals  restrict and trap the large r bubbles at the center of the 
column. Such a phenomen on can be clearly dis tinguished in the bubble column with the 
hexagonal configuration because  this arrangement ha d smaller inter -tube gap s and a large 
space (clearance) between the wall of the column and the vertical internals.  
 This observation was recently confirmed by conducting a comparative 
investigation and analysis in our laboratory to  measure the bubble passage frequency and 
bubble chord length in the same experimental setup and operating conditions , using a 4-
point fiber optical probe for the air -water system  [33]. The experimental results show ed 
that the bubble passage frequency (number of bubbles passing through a unit volume in the 
column per unit time) in the center of the column with the hexa gonal configuration was 
lower than in the column with a circular configuration , while it was higher than in the 
column with the circular arrangement in the wall region .  
This was  due to the absence  of tubes in this  region, which could facilitate bubble 
rising, thereby  increas ing the gas holdup . For example, at  the wall region and  at a 
superficial gas velocity of 0.45 m/s, the percentage of increase in the bubble passage 194 
 
 
 frequency was 140%, while the percentage of decrease was 15.2% at the center of the 
column  with the hexagonal configuration . Additionally, the bubble chord length (bubble 
size) in the bubble column wit h the hexagonal arrangement was smaller than in the column 
with the circular configuration at the center and the wall regions by 18% and 1. 5%, 
respectivel y. Moreover, the bubble chord length was greater in the center than in the wall 
area for the  column with the hexagonal configuration ; and this strongly confirm s the 
phenomen on of trapping the large bubbles in the center of the column  and accumulating 
the small bubbles at  the wall region . These experimental results , obtained using a  4-point 
fiber optical probe , show ed increasing bubble passage  frequency at the wall region, with 
decreasing  frequency  at the center . 
 Reducing the bubble chord length in the colum n with the hexagonal configuration 
was a factor that led to the gas holdup in the bubble column with the hexagonal 
configuration having a significant increase in the wal l region, while it had a noticeable 
decrease at the center of the co lumn . As discussed earlier, inserting an extra central tube in 
the circular configuration play ed an important role in the gas holdup distribution, where a 
significant decrease was observed in the gas holdup values at the center of the column in 
the case with the central vertical tube , while a noticeable increase was obtained in the 
absence of the central tube.  
 The underlying reason behind this variation in the gas holdup may result from 
effect of the wall lubrication force, which drives the bubbles away from the wall of the 
vertical internal tube s, thereby decreas ing the gas holdup in the vicinity of the vertical 
internals and increas ing the gas holdup in the ga ps between  the vertical internals.  195

profiles at a superficial gas velocity of 0.20 m/s

profiles at a superficial gas velocity of  0.45 m/s  
 
In addition , the bubble column without vertical internal tubes exhibit ed a gas 
holdup profile for all studied superficial gas velocit ies shaped as a smooth parabola . The 
parabolic gas holdup profile of the bubble column without vertical internals , which was  
obtained in the current study and reported in the literature  [64,70]  under the churn turbulent 
196 
 
 
 flow regime also follow ed a similar profile (i.e., p arabolic shape), which is typical of coarse 
gas distributor (i.e., holes diameter greater than 1  mm)  [71]. However, the bubble columns 
equipped with dense vertical internal tubes display ed wavy -shape d profiles along with a 
parabolic trend for all investigated configurations with vertical internals. These wavy 
profiles for the bubble columns with vertical internal tubes varied  accor ding to the 
configuration s of the vertical internal s in the bubble column. Th is variation  in the gas 
holdup profiles among the bubble columns with vert ical internals was due to the different 
arrangements of tubes over the CSA  of the column, the shape of the pitch for each 
configuration, and the space (clearance) between the bundle of vertical internals and the 
column wall. Each concave area of  these prof iles represent s the azimuthal average of the 
values of the gas holdup in the spaces among the vertical internal tubes. These kinds of 
wavy gas holdup profiles have not been reported in the literature for a bubble column with 
dense vertical internals when measured by optical probes . In the literature , parabolic 
profiles were only obtained in the column s with vertical internal s, which were  similar to 
those achieved in the bubble column without ve rtical internal tubes. However, wavy 
profiles were reported by Al Mesfer  [40] and Al Mesfer et al.  [34] when they measured the 
gas holdup in the bubble column with dense vertical internals using the CT technique. Th e 
difference between the gas holdup profiles measured by the optical probe and the CT 
technique are due to the limitation s of the optical probe technique , such as the local point 
measurements and access issue s for the probe, in particular in the  bubble column  equipped 
densely  with vertical internals. For example, the gas holdup measurements  made using an  
optical probe  were  usually conduct ed at four points (at the dimensionless radius, r/R ( -) of 
0, 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9) along the radius of the column and in the gaps ( which usually had high 197 
 
 
 gas holdup values) between the vertical internal tubes . Hence, it was difficult to measure 
the local gas holdup in the vicinity  of the internals, where there were  usually low gas holdup 
values. However,  this can be achieved by the CT technique, which measures the local gas 
holdup in an area not exceeding 3.62 mm2 (area of each pixel in the gas holdup images)  
due to the size of the detector collimators that are used in this study (2  mm × 5  mm) . For 
that reason, the wavy gas holdup profile s in the bubble column equipped with vertical 
internal tubes  were not obtained using the optical probe . 
Line-averaged gas holdup profile s in this study were  calculated by averaging all the 
pixels of a gas holdup image in the vertical and horizontal directions , after excluding the 
tubes , to provide diametrical line -average p rofiles, as displayed  in Figure 10, Figure 11, 
Figure 12, and  Figure 13. In this study, the vertical and horizontal gas holdup profiles were 
also computed using  another method because  the azimuthally  averaged profiles usually are 
calculated for  symmetric systems over the entire CSA  (i.e., gas holdup values are invariant 
along the pixels in the θ-direction). However, the bubble columns equipped densely with 
vertical internal tubes hardly maintain ed a perfect symmetric distribution as observed in 
the bubble column with vertical tubes because  these vertical internals  and their 
arrangements play ed a significant role in the gas-liquid  distribution . Therefore, line-
averaged profiles were  computed.  The lin e-averaged gas holdup profiles  verify , the 
phenomen on of increasing gas holdup in the wall region of the column due to  the insertion  
of dense vertical internal tubes . Interestingly, the diametrical profiles of the line -averaged  
(vertical and horizontal) gas holdup of the bubble columns with different configuratio ns of 
vertical tubes were more similar to the gas holdup profile s in the core region  of the bubble 
column without tubes, particularly with the  dimensionless radius, r/R  = 0-0.6). 198

  Therefore, the values of the gas holdup obtained in the core region of the bubble 
column without tubes operat ing under a high superficial gas velocity based on the TCSA  
of the column can be achieved in the bubble columns with dense vertical tubes if these 
columns operate at the same superficial gas velocity , but if it is calculated based on the 
FCSA of the flow. However, significant increases in gas holdup values can be obtained  in 
the bubble column equipped with vertical internal tubes if these columns operated at the 
same high superficial gas velocity  but are calculated based on the TCSA  of the column , as 
investigated and demonstrated recently at mReal by Al Mesfer  [40] and Kagumba [72]. 
Local gas holdup profiles along the horizontal and vertical pixels of the cross -sectional 
image also were obtained in this study for bubble columns  with and without vertical 
internals operated at a superficial gas velocity of 0.45 m/s, as displayed in Figure 14 and 
Figure 15.

 As shown in these figures, the local gas holdup prof iles decreased across the bundle 
of vertical internals as compared to the parabolic gas holdup profile for a bubble column 
without vertical internals. However, the highe st gas holdup was observed in the center of 
the column ( ‒0.15 ≤ r/R ≤ 0.15) with the ci rcular configuration without the central internal , 
due to the absence of the central internal in this region. Additionally, pronounced peaks in 
the gas holdup were observed in the inner gaps between the vertical internals due to the 
wall shear of these vertical internals , which induced the bubbles to accumulate at the center 
of the gap and to cause an increase in the gas holdup in this region  [13,50] . Moreover, a 
close analysis of the gas ho ldup distributions and their profiles in the central compartments 
(i.e., at r/R = 0) for the bubble columns with different configurations of vertical internals 
(i.e., the area enclosed by four vertical internals) revealed that the highest gas holdup 
202 
 
 
 magnit ude was obtained with the central compartment of a circular configuration (i.e., 
circular without the central internal). This increase in the gas holdup magnitude can be 
attributed to the circular configuration (without the central internal) , where a large r 
compartme nt (square pitch) in the center allows for more bubbles to rise inside this 
compartment as compared to the hexagonal  configuration which is more compact, with 
triangular pitch. These results indicate that the geometry of the compartment (size an d type 
of pitch) greatly affects the gas holdup distribution between the compartments [73]. Hence, 
the effect of the geometry of the compartment should be considered when  developing a 
model or correlation to predict gas holdup in a bubble column with vertical internals.  The 
arithmetic means of  the cross -sectional gas holdup , presented  in Table 1, were  calculated 
to show  the effects of the arrangement of vertical tubes  on the gas holdup. The calculation 
of the arithmetic means of the cross -sectional gas holdup distributions (𝜀𝑔̅) is outlined as 
below.  
• Conducting azimuthally (circumferentially) averaged radial profile from the 2D 
image of the gas holdup distribution.  
• Performing numerical integration based on Simpson's rule for the following 
equation : 
𝜀𝑔̅=2
𝑅2∫𝜀(𝑟)𝑟𝑑𝑟𝑅
0 (10) 
where R represents the radius of the bubble column and 𝜀(𝑟) represents the values of a gas 
holdup at a specific radius ( r). Table 1 represents the values of arithmetic means for the 
cross -sectional gas holdup  as a function of the superficial gas velocity for different 
configurations of bubble columns. The values of the arithmetic mean of the cross -sectional 203 
 
 
 gas holdup for all configurations were similar , confirm ing that the  values of the gas holdup 
in the bubble column equipped with vertical internal tubes  and operated under high 
superficial gas velocities (churn turbule nt flow regime) calculated based on the FCSA  of 
the flow can  be estimated by using  the values of the gas holdup in the bubble column 
without internals , except for the values close to the wall region.

3.3. INFLUENCE OF THE CONFIGURATION DESIGNS OF VERTICAL 
INTERNALS ON THE DEGREE OF THE UNIFORMITY OF THE GAS 
HOLDUP DISTRIBUTION  
After the visualization ( i.e., gas-liquid  distribution map) described in the previous 
section qualitatively  demonstrated  which configurations provide d uniform gas holdup  
distribution s over the CSA  of the colu mns, a quantitative analysis was needed to 
characterize the  effect of the arrange ment on the gas holdup. Therefore, in th e present work, 
the maldistribution factor (MDF) was computed to assess the uniformity (homogeneity) of                                                             Arithmetic mean

 the gas-liquid  distribution quantitatively. Hoek  et al. [74] introd uced the following formula 
(Eq. 11) to calculate the MDF , which has been implemented  in many studies  [75–77].

Eq. 11 is  based on the deviation of the gas holdup in each pixel  (𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗) from the 
cross -sectional mean  (𝜀𝑎𝑣𝑔) gas holdup where smaller values (close r to zero) indicate the 
uniform gas holdup distribution . 
The existence of vertical internal tubes  arranged in different configurations ( i.e., 
hexagonal, circular, and circular with a central tube ) significantly reduce d the 
maldistribution factor for all ranges of studied superficial gas velocities (i.e., enhance d the 
gas holdup distributions)  as exhibited in  Figure 16. Additionally, the MDF for the bubble 
column with the hexagonal arrangement of vertical internals  was the lowe st, meaning that 
the hexagonal configuration offered a better gas holdup distribution. The maldistribution 
factors confirmed the results obtained by visual analysis, which were explained earlier. 
Moreover, for all studied superficial gas velocities, the circular configuration without a 
tube at the center had a lower MDF than the circular design with an extra central tube.  
Furthermore, Figure 16 illustrates that the MDF rose as the superficial gas velocities 
increased for all configurations of bubble columns. However, the  MDF of the bubble  
column with the hexagonal arrangements of internals  remain ed almost constant as  the 
superficial gas velocity rose. 205 
 
 
 The nonuniform (maldistribution ) gas phase distribution over the entire CSA of the 
bubble and slurry bubble column reactors led to (1) a decrease in the interfacial areas for 
the mass transfer rate, (2) an increase in the magnitude of the liquid backmixing, and (3) 
an increase in the po ssibility of forming a hotspot, any of which would significantly affect 
the conversion and selectivity of these reactors [17]. Therefore, from an industrial 
perspective, enhancing the quality of the gas -liquid distribution over the bubble column’s 
CSA will improve the heat and mass transfer rates between the gas -liquid phases in a 
bubble column or the gas -catalyst -liquid phases in a slurry bubble column. This is true 
because these transport phenomena depend mainly on the interaction between phases. 
Besides improving the heat and mass transfer characteristics, the liquid backmixing will 
decrease, which is desired in the churn turbulent flow regime to achieve the optimal 
performance of these reactors.

 4. REMARKS  
A unique comparative investigation was performed in a 6 -inch bubble column using 
an advanced CT technique to visualize and quantify the impacts of the presence  of the 
vertical internal tubes and their different configurations on the cross -sectional gas holdup 
distribution and its diametrical profiles under the churn turbulent flow regime. Three 
geometrical configurations of vertical tubes (i.e., hexagonal, circu lar without a central tube, 
circular with an extra central tube), which had the same size and the same occluded area 
(~25% of the TCSA of the column targeting FTS) were employed in this study as well as 
a bubble column without vertical tubes. The key resul ts and findings of this work are briefly 
listed below:  
• The reconstructed CT images disclose that the gas holdup distributions over the entire 
CSA of the bubble columns with internals are entirely different, despite using the same 
size vertical internal s and the same percentage of the CSA occluded by the internal s. 
• Two-dimensional  gas holdup distribution images clearly exhibit a symmetrical gas 
holdup distribution over the CSA  for the bubble column without vertical internal tubes 
for all studied superficial gas velocit ies. On the other hand, the symmetric gas holdup 
distribution phenomen on was not sustain ed in the bubble column equipped densely 
with vertical internal tubes. How ever, the bubble column with tubes arranged in a 
circular configuration with an extra central tube displayed  distinctly asymmetric gas 
holdup distributions.  
• The well -known phenomen on (more gas at the center of the column and less gas at the 
wall region) in  the bubble column without vertical internal tubes still occurred for all 207 
 
 
 studied configurations  in the bubble columns equipped densely with vertical internal 
tubes that occluded  about  25% of the TCSA  of the column s. 
• Inserting an extra tube at the center o f a circular configuration play ed a vital role in the 
gas-liquid  distribution over the CSA  of the bubble column , where it cause d significant 
decreases in the gas holdup at the center of the column as well as an increase  in the 
degree of non -uniformity of the gas holdup distribution as compared to the circular 
configuration without a central tube.  
• The hexagonal con figuration of internal s had the advantage of providing the best  spread 
of the gas phase over the ent ire column ’s CSA , particularly in the wall re gion. 
• Gas holdup values at the wall region of the bubble columns increase d with the insertion  
of a bundle of internal s for  all investigated configuration s. However, a remarkable 
increase in the  gas holdup was obtained  only with the hexagonal configuration.  
• Unlike parabolic gas holdup profiles obtained in the bubble column without vertical 
internal tubes, wavy gas holdup profiles were  achieved in the bubble columns with 
vertical interna l tubes using the CT technique. However, these kinds of wa vy profiles 
were not obt ained in the bubble column with internal s when the gas holdup was 
measured by the optical probe -based technique as had been reported in the literature.  
• Interestingly, the gas holdup values achieved in the core (r/R  = 0-0.6) of the bubble 
column wi thout vertical internal tubes operated at the churn turbulent flow regime were  
similar to those obtained in the bubble columns equipped densely with vertical internal 
tubes if th ose columns operated at the same superficial gas velocity calculated based 
on the free (open) cross -sectional area  (FCSA) of  the flow. Therefore, the gas holdup 
values of the bubble column with vertical internal tubes can be estimated using the 208 
 
 
 values of the gas holdup of the bubble column without vertical internals at the core 
region.  
• The maldistribution factor (MDF) decreased with  the existence of vertical internals  that 
were  arranged differently ( i.e., hexagonal, circular without central internal , circular 
with central internal ) over the bubble column ’s CSA . However, the hexag onal 
configuration provide d lowest  values of  the MDF than all other vertical internals  
arrangements ( i.e., bubble column without vertical internals , circular with and without 
central internal ) for all studied superficial gas velocities. Additionally, the M DF 
increased significantly with an increase in the superficial gas velocities for all 
configurations exc ept the hexagonal configuration, which remained  almost constant as 
the superficial gas velocities  increased . 
• Beyond the visualization and quantification  of the impact of the vertical internal tube  
configurations on the gas-liquid  distribution  by the CT technique , this study provide s 
reliable benc hmarking data tom evaluat e and validat e CFD simulations and 
phenomenological models to better predict the hydrodynamic  factors involved in a 
bubble colu mn with and without a bundle of heat -exchanging tubes , thereby facilitat ing 
the design an d scale -up of these reactors.  
• The current study was performed using a 6 -inch (0.1524 m O.D.) bubble column with 
and with out vertical internal tubes; hence, further studies are needed to address the 
impact of the presence of these tubes and their arrangements in a large -scale bubble 
column on the gas -liquid distributions. These investigations are in progress in the 
mReal lab oratory.  209

ABSTRACT  
The impact of dense vertical internal tubes and their configurations on the gas 
holdup distributions and their diametrical profiles in pilot -scale bubble column is 
visualized and qua ntified for the first time ever using an advanced gamma -ray computed 
tomography (CT) technique. Two  arrangements  of vertical internals (circular and 
hexagonal configurations) occupying the same cross -sectional area  (CSA)  of the column 
(about 25% of the total cross -sectional area to repre sent the heat exchanging tubes that are 
used in the Fischer -Tropsch synthesis), were examined in addition to the measurement in 
the bubble column without vertical internals. Moreover, the gas holdup distribution results 
of the 18 -inch bubble column are com pared  with an available data of 6 -inch bubble 
columns with and without vertical internals. CT scans have been conducted  for 18 -inch 
bubble columns with and without vertical internals for the air -water system under a wide 
range of superficial gas velocity ( 5-45 cm/s). The experimental results indicate that an 
improvement in the gas holdup distribution over the column's cross -sectional area is 
obtained when the vertical internal tubes (arranged in either a circular or a hexagonal 
configuration) were used. How ever, better cross -sectional gas holdup distribution was 
achieved in the bubble column with vertical internals arranged in a hexagonal configuration 
as compared to the bubble column without and with vertical internals arranged in a circular 217 
 
 
 arrangement. Ad ditionally, the averages of the cross -sectional gas holdup and their profiles 
for bubble column with and without vertical internals are close to each other when the 
bubble column with vertical internals is operating at a high superficial gas velocity, whic h 
is calculated based on the free cross -sectional area for the flow. Furthermore, the gas 
holdup distributions are further improved when the larger  bubble column with vertical 
internals was used  as compared to the 6 -inch bubble columns without and with int ernals.  
Keywords:  Bubble column, vertical internal tubes, vertical internals configurations, scale 
up, gas holdup  distribution, computed  tomography (CT).

1. INTRODUCTION  
Bubble/slurry bubble columns with a bundle of heat-exchanging tubes are well -
fitted reactors for conducting highly exothermic reactions , such as Fischer -Tropsch (FT) 
synthesis, acetic acid production,  cyclohexanol manufacturing , and many others  1–5. The 
reason these reactors were selected for wide applications in industry is that they possess 
superior advantages in facilitating sufficient heat removal and temperature control (close 
to isothermal condition), which allow  for a secure and high reactor pe rformance  6–12.  
Despite the wide variety of applications of bubble/slurry bubble columns (e.g., in 
industry), the design and scale -up of these reactors is a difficult engineering task due to the 
complex behavior of multiphase flow patterns and the absence of a phenomenological 
model that can reliably predict the flow patterns for these  columns 13–16. Additionally , the 
presence of the dense  geometry of vertical tubes  inside these reactors further alter s the flow 218 
 
 
 structure  and the intensit y of the mixing  17–21. As a result, these vertical internal tubes make 
the design and scale -up even more challenging and complicated. Therefore, a 
comprehensive understanding of the impacts of vertical tubes  on the hydrodynamics of 
these reactors is much needed to the successful design, scale -up, and optimize  performance 
of a bubble/slurry bubble column with a bundle of  the intense  heat exchanging tubes.  
One of the most critical hydrodynamic parameters for the design, scale -up, and 
modeling of bubble/slurry bubble columns is the gas holdup  because of  its impacts on the 
momentum, heat, and mass transfer rates between phases ; hence , it characterizes the 
performance of these reactors  22–26. Also , local gas holdup  distribution has a significant 
effect on  the reactor ’s performance. For example, the high degree of non -uniform gas 
holdup  distribution inside these columns causes a significant  reduction in the specific 
interfacial area between the gas-liquid or gas -slurry phases, thereby  reduc ing the mass 
transfer rate. Moreover, this uneven distribution could increase the liquid  back -mixing and 
thus may promote a temperature gradient that could  lead to a greater  chance  that local hot  
spots  will form  27–29. Furthermore, improving the gas holdup  distribution by presenting 
different designs or arrangements of heat -exchanging tubes  will increase the contact area 
between the gas -liquid phases in a bubble column or the gas-catalyst -liquid phases in a 
slurry bubble column ; this  allows for a high mass transf er rate , which consequently  
enhance s the reaction rate.  
The proper arrangement of the heat -exchanging tubes is crucial to maintain ing the 
uniformity of the gas-liquid distribution over the column ’s cross -section al area . This w ill 
provide  better contact and interaction between phases , which enhance s the productivity of 
these reactors.  Eventually, understanding  the influence of vertical tubes  on gas -liquid 219 
 
 
 distribution inside bubble columns is vital for the safe operation and efficient desi gn of 
these reactors. Unfortunately, up -to-date, information  of gas -liquid distribution for large -
scale  bubble column with intense  vertical internals is no t available in the literature.  
So far, much  researcher ha s focused extensively on the hydrodynamics of bubble 
columns without vertical tubes  to achieve high performance in these reactors. However, 
few studies have investigated the effects of vertical tubes on the hydrodynamics of these 
reactors, while many of the industrial applications for the bubble/slurry bubble columns 
involve inserti ng bundle of vertical tubes to (1) remove the released heat of th e reaction , 
(2) enhance the breakup of bubbles , or (3) reduce a degree of back -mixing of a liquid phase 
30–34. As pointed out earlier, the existence of the bundle of vertical tubes  significantly 
affects  the fluid dynamics of these reactors, and quantif ying and predicti ng these impacts 
is difficult  without experimental work. Therefore, the current investigation focuses on 
bubble column s equipped with dense  vertical tubes . 
To the best of the authors ’ knowledge, the  local gas holdup  distribution over the 
entire  cross -section al area  of the bubble column equipped with vertical tubes  has been 
measured  using gam ma-ray computed tomography (CT) in no more than two studies in the 
literature. One of these studies was performed by Chen et al. 35, where the authors measured 
for the first time the gas holdup distribution and related  radial profiles in a pilot-scale 
bubble column (44 cm in diameter) with and without vertical internals for air -water and 
air-drakeoil systems operated under a range of superficial gas velocities from  2-10 cm/s.  
To simulate the heat -exchanging tubes used in industrial methanol synthesis, the 1 -inch 
aluminum vertical internals in their work were designed and arranged sparsely in a circular 
configuration that blocked only 5% of th e column’s cross -sectional area . Their 220 
 
 
 experimental results revealed that the gas holdup  distributions at the highest superficial gas 
velocity (i.e., 10 cm/s ) were axisymmetric at the fully developed region for both systems 
in the bubble column s with and without vertical internals. Additionally, the gas holdup 
values obtained in the bubble column without vertical internals for the air -drakeoil system 
were lower than those  measured in the same column for the air -water system. Furthermore, 
the authors pointed out  that the ef fects of the internals were not significant on the gas 
holdup for both systems.  
The second of the two studies was recently conducted by Al Mesfer et al. 36. They 
imaged and quantified the gas holdup distribution s in bubble column s (14 cm in diameter) 
with and without vertical internal s for the air -water system under a wide range of 
superficial gas velocity (5 -45 cm/s) calculated based on the free and the total cross -
sectional area (CSA) of the column. The  authors  used 0.5-inch Plexiglas®  vertical internals 
that were arranged densely in a hexagonal shape over the CSA  of the column. These 
vertical internals  were designed to cover 25% of the column’s CSA to represent the heat -
exchanging tubes that were u sed in Fischer -Tropsch (FT) synthesis . The CT images 
revealed  that the gas holdup distributions  were  almost axisymmetric in the bubble columns 
with and without vertical internals for all studied superficial  gas velocities except for the 
high superficial gas velocities of 30 and 45 cm/s , where  distributions  exhibited  
asymmetrically. Moreover, the authors found that the overall and local gas holdups  rose 
significantly with increasing superficial gas velocities when the gas velocity was calculated 
based on  the total  CSA of the bubble column. Furthermore, they reported that the overall 
and local gas holdup  profiles that were achieved  in the bubble column without vertical 
internals operated under high superficial gas velocity could be extrapolated to the columns 221 
 
 
 with vertical internals if these c olumns worked under the same superficial gas velocity if it 
was calculated based on the free CSA of  the column.  However, the intensity of mixing and 
local liquid/slurry velocity and turbulent parameters cannot be similarly extrapolated  5. 
According to the prior discussion, it is evident that the chara cteristics of gas holdup 
distributions in a large -scale bubble column equipped with dense (covering 25% of the 
total CSA) vertical tubes have not yet been visualized and quantified. Therefore, this study 
is the first attempt to fill this gap through visual ization and quantification of the gas -liquid 
distribution over the entire CSA of large -scale bubble columns with and without vertical 
internals using an advanced gamma -ray computed tomography ( CT) technique . An a ir-
water system was used in this work because there in quite a large  database related to  air-
water system s that can  be applied  for comparison and to properly  report the effect of 
vertical internals in a large pilot-scale column (44 cm in diameter) . To achieve this goal , 
the following objective s were set for this study:  
(i) Investigating  the impact of the bundle of vertical internals on the gas holdup 
distributions and their profiles in a large scale bubble column.  
(ii) Examining  the effect of tubes configurations ( i.e., hexagonal and circular 
arrangements) on the gas holdup distributions and their profiles.  
(iii) Assessing  the effect of the superficial gas velocity on the gas holdup distributions 
and their diametrical profiles.  
(iv) Comparing  the obtained results in 18 -inch bubble columns with those of 6-inch 
bubble columns to assess and address the impact of using different size s of 
column s on the gas holdup distribution s and their profiles.  222 
 
 
 The knowledge  gained  from this work and from previous studies  will further 
improve the fundamental understanding of the influence of vertical tubes  on the  gas-liquid 
distribution not only in bubble/slurry bubble columns  but also for the equipment , which is 
utilize d in power generation such as boiler s, boiling  and pressurized  water nuclear reactors. 
Additionally, the obtained experimental data will expand the database for the bubble 
column s with vertical tubes and serve as benchmarking data for the evaluation and 
validation of three -dimensional (3 -D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation s to 
enhanc e the predict ion of the hydrodynamics of these columns.  Only after  CFD models are 
validated against reliable benchmark data for various  operating conditions and scales of 
bubble/slurry bubble columns equipped with dense vertical tubes for the air -water system, 
can the validated models be employed  as useful tools to predict the hydrodynamics for 
different scales of bubble/slurry  bubble columns operate d under various feed inputs and  
running conditions , including those of interest to industry . Finally, th e current work will 
support the design  and scale -up processes by providing baseline data for different scale s of 
bubble columns  using  a bundle of  dense  heat-exchanging tubes.  
2. EXPERIMENTAL WORK  
2.1. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP  
Gas-liquid distribution and gas hold up profiles were visualized and quantified in a 
pilot-scale Plexiglas®  bubble column of 18 -inch (0.46 m) diameter and with a height of 
144 inches (3.66 m). A schematic diagram of the pilot -scale bubble column equipped with 
dense  vertical internals is displ ayed  in Figure 1. In this study, the bubble column was fitted  
with a gas distributor , which was placed  above the gas chamber (plenum).

  This gas distributor is a  stain less steel perforated plate designed with 241 holes , 
each 3 mm in diameter , as exhibited in Figure 2. These holes were designed in a triangular 
pitch of 2.5 cm over the CSA  of the perforated plate , forming an open area of 1.09 %. A 
bundle of 7 5 Plexiglas®  vertical internals filling 25% of the CSA of the column was used 
in this study to represent the heat-exchanging tubes used in FT synthesis  37–40. Each 
Plexiglas® vertical internal had a diameter of 1  inch (2.54 cm) and a height of 4 m .

 Two geometric arrangements for these vertical internals , namely hexagonal and 
circular configurations , were examined in th e current work, as shown in Figure 3. The 
vertical internals with a hexagonal configuration were designed and arranged in an 
equilateral (triangular) pitch of 4.5 cm, whereas the vertical internals with a circular 
configuration were organized in one central internal, and the rest of the internals were 
distribu ted in five concentric circles, located in a dimensionless radius ( r/R) of 0.2, 0.4, 
0.5, 0.7, and 0.9.  With 9 -inch clearance from the gas distributor, the vertical internal s were  
housed and held t ightly inside the bubble column using four aluminum spacers 
(configurations) and a top plate.

In this work, the bubble column s with and without vertical internals  were operated  
at ambient pressure and temperature using  continuous mode for the gas (air) phase and 
batch mode for the liquid (water) phase. The air was supplied by a n industrial compressor  
(Ingersoll Rand ) and pass ed through a flow measurement system that include d an air dryer, 
filters, pressure gauges, and a pressure regulator to ensure only dry, oil-free air entered and 
sparged continuously through a pool of purified water during the operation of the bubble 
columns. The volume tric flow rate of the gas phase  was monitored and controlled by a set

this study to be conducted  at a broad range of superficial gas velocities. These  gas velocit ies 
were  examined to fulfill the industrial needs for a high superficial gas velocity ( i.e., in the  
churn turbulent flow regime) because most application s of these reactors operate un der 
churn turbulent flow regime to achieve high productivity  41,42. The computations of the 
superficial gas velocity for the bubbl e column without  vertical  internals were based  on the 
total CSA of the column ; however , for the column equipped densely with vertical  internals , 
the comput ation was  based on the free  (open ) CSA for the flow.  The free CSA for the flow 
represents the difference between the total CSA of the column without vertical internals 
and the area occupied by all vertical internals , as shown below :

During all experiments, the average of the dynamic (dispersion) level of the gas-
liquid was kept constant at 2.67  m (H/D = 6) away from  the gas distributor , which was 
monitored  using  a measuring tape attached to the Plexiglas®  bubble column.  It was shown  
in our studies that the variation in the dynamic  height will not affect the reactor ’s 
hydrodynamics in its fully developed flow region.  All CT scans for pilot -scale bubble 
columns with and without vertical internals were performed  at one axial level, 1.3 m (H/D 
= 3) above the gas distributor. This axial level for the  scans was chosen  because within this 
region , a fully developed flow would exist, and according to many researchers 22,43,44, the 
local gas holdup and bubble properties  (bubble rise veloc ity, bubble chor d length, and 
bubble frequency) would be almost invariant . The other reason for selecting this level was 
to complement the available data about  bubble properties measured in the same 227 
 
 
 experimental setup for the air -water system at the same axial level using the four-point 
fiber optical probe technique, which was developed, manufactured, and tested in our 
laboratory ( Multiphase Reactors Engineering and Applications Laboratory, mReal ) 39. The 
integration of  these results , which were obtained  by advanced techniques ( i.e., CT and four-
point fiber optical probe) , will improve the qualitative and quantitative understanding of 
fluid dynamics in  a bubble column  with vertical internals.  
The pilot-scale bubble columns with and without dense  vertical internals were well 
centered and balanced inside the open circular space when using  the CT technique. 
Additionally, the columns wer e well supported in two places, at the bottom and top of the 
column, using an aluminum frame with pieces of rubber to eliminate the mechanical 
vibration that that would otherwise significantly affects the measurement of the gas 
holdups  45–48. 
2.2. GAMMA -RAY COMPUTED TO MOGRAPHY (CT) TECHNIQUE  
A single gamma -ray computed tomography (CT) technique, which is a part of a 
unique dual -source gamma -ray computed tomography (DSCT) scanner , was used in this 
study. In a noninvasive way, the DSCT imag es and quantif ies the internal distributions of 
two- or three -phase flow s, which are extensively  encountered  in different  types  of 
multiphase reactors or flow systems at various  operating conditions. This technique has 
been applied successfully to different  multiphase flow sys tems in our l aboratory (mReal) 
at the Chemical and Biochemical Engineering Department at Missouri  University of 
Science and Technology (Missouri S&T). Examples of such applications are in pebble bed  
49,50, bubble column  36,38, fluidized bed  51–53, and spout ed bed 54–56. Detail ed description s of 228 
 
 
 the fundamental underlying principle , hardware, and software  related to the DSCT have 
been reported elsewhere in Varma 57 and are briefly described  in this section.  
In summary, the DSCT technique is comprised of two gamma -ray sources, namely 
cesium (Cs -137, with a half-life of about 37 years) and cobalt (Co -60, with a half-life of 
about 5.24 years) , with an initial activity of ~ 250 and 50 mCi, respectively. Each of these 
sources was designed  to face the center of an array of 15-sodium iodide (NaI) detectors to 
acquire emitted photons. However, for the present work, a single gamma -ray source (Cs -
137, with 662 keV photon energy) and its arc of detector s were used to visualize and 
quantify for t he first time the time -averaged cross -sectional gas -liquid distribut ions and 
their profiles in a pilot-scale bubble column equipped with and without dense vertical 
internals, as depicted in Figure 4. 
 This Cs -137 point source was well housed  inside a lead -shielded c ontainer and 
further collimated using a lead collimator 5 mm in height and 40° in a horizontal plane  to 
provide a fan beam o f gamma radiation focusing toward the detector arc. Similarly, 15 lead 
collimators with an open rectangular slit of 5  mm in width and 10 mm in height were 
installed in front of each detector to collimate the detectors to ensure each detector receive 
lines (beams) of gamma  rays with sufficient counts and less of a scattering effect 58. The 
dimensions of collimators for the Cs -137 source and their detectors were designed to 
provide enough open area to acquire counts (photons) with suf ficient statistics (high signal -
to-noise ratio) at the select ed frequency and samp ling rate 59–61. 
Both gamma -ray sources and their arrays of detectors were mounted and installed 
on a motorized rotatable circular plate. This circular plate was attached to a lift unit  (square  
plate) , whic h allow ed for the whole system ( i.e., circular plate, gamma -sources, and their 229 
 
 
 detectors) to perform CT sca ns in different selected axial planes automatically. T he circular 
and square plates have a central opening space, which is dedicated  to the objects to be 
examined . 
During the scanning of  the investigated bubble column, which was well balanced 
and centered inside the circular opening area of the CT technique, the Cs -137 source and 
its detectors were rotated around the column by repositioning  the circular plate in a 
stepwise movement (approximately 1.83° for ea ch step) that was controlled by a 
programmed , automated step motor.  For a given step of rotation (each source view), the 
array of the C s-137 source detectors was moved automatically 21 times in an arc of 
0.13°/step, which was achieved  by another independent automated stepping motor. These 
21 steps of movements in one view were developed to produce more beams of gamma -ray 
(about 315 [21 × 15] projections per each view of the Cs -137 source)  to improve the spatial 
resolution of images. Th erefore, for a complete scan (197 views), the detectors acquired 
62,055 (315 × 197) projections that passed through the column from different angles. These 
acquired projections were recorded  at a frequency  of 10 Hz with a sampling rate  of 60 
samples and sent to a computer  where they were used as input data in a reconstruction 
algorithm to create  a linear attenuation coefficient distribution of the scanned level s.  
Rather than use other  reconstruction algorithms (e.g.,  filter back -filtration , Fourier, 
algebraic,  and expectation  maximization  [EM]) , alternating minimization  (AM)  algorithm 
was selected  for this study to reconstruct the cross -section of linear attenuation distribution 
for the various scans. The AM algorithm was chosen  and applied in this wo rk due to its 
capability to account for the stochastic nature of gamma -rays over the CSA  of the objects 
as compared with other  algorithms. This AM algorithm was initially proposed  by 230 
 
 
 O’Sullivan and Benac  62 and applied for the first time by Varma et al.  63 to reconstruct an 
image of the phase holdup d istribution in a two-phase system . Varma et al.  63 conducted a 
comparative study to reconstruct the  gas holdup distribution in a two-phase system  
(phantom) by using the EM and AM algorithms.  
 Their reconstructed images reveal ed that the images obtained using the AM 
algorithm exhibit qualitatively an d quantitatively more enhancement  in the gas holdup 
distribution than those produced by  the EM algorithm . These reconstructed linear 
attenuation coefficients for different cases of scans were subsequently used to calculate  and 
produce  the gas holdup distribution  images  by using special  relationships , which were 
developed  to estimat e gas hold up distribution s and their profiles in bubble colu mns with 
and without internals. The details of these relatio nships for calculating gas hold up as well 
as the methodology for excluding the vertical internals from the gas hold up distributions 
and their profiles are available in our previous paper  64,65. 
One of the benefits of this CT technique is the possibility of using it as a gamma -
ray densitometry  (GRD) technique  66,67 to monitor online the flow behavior inside different 
multiphase reactor s, demarcate flow regimes, detect the maldistribution  (e.g., bypassing 
and stagnanc y, hot spots), and measure phase holdup profiles. This  GRD method  employs  
only the central collimated detector opposite the source , without rotati ng the source and 
detector (both fixed)  68,69. Another important feature is the ability of CT to scan large  
columns up to 30 inches (0.762 ) in diameter and 108 inches ( 2.743  m) in height. 
Furthermore, 3 -D visualization of phase distributions can be achieved  by scanning the 
object at multiple planes of the column’s height.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
3.1. ACCURACY AND REPRODUCIBILITY OF THE GAMMA -RAY 
COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) MEASUREMENTS  
The accuracy of the CT measurements was recently addressed and quantified in our 
previous publication  65 through a scanning Plexiglas® phantom that consisted  of two 
concentric c ylinders (inner cylinder of 3-inch diameter; outer cylinder of 6-inch diameter ). 
Four cases of this phantom (i.e., empty phantom; inner cylinder filled with water, while the 
space between the coa xial cylinders was empty; empty inner cylinder, while the space

 between the coaxial cylinders was only filled with water; both cylinders filled with water) 
were scanned independently, after which the linear attenuation coefficients  (μ, cm-1) for 
these cases of the phantom were reconstructed using the alternating minimization (AM) 
algorithm.  
 The experimental results of scanning the phantom in terms of  the linear attenuation 
coefficient (μ, cm-1) images and their diametrical profiles show the capability of t he CT 
technique to reproduce the dimensions of the phantom with a discrepancy of  only 1.39%. 
Additionally, the reconstructed linear attenuation coefficients of air, water, and Plexiglas® 
materials were compared  to the theoretical linear attenuation coefficient (μ, cm-1) of these 
materials, and it was found  that they are in good agreement with theoretical values. For 
example, the absolute relative error (ARE) between the reconstructed linear attenuation 
coefficie nts (μ, cm-1) and the theoretical values of air, water, and Plexiglas® were 1.3%, 
2.4%, and 3.2%, respectively.  
 The reproducibility of the CT measurements was also checked and assessed 
systemically in this study. In this reproducibility assessment, an 18-inch bubble column 
with an air-water system and no vertical internal tubes was scanned at the fully developed 
flow regime ( i.e., at an axial level of H/D = 3) to obtain the gas holdup distr ibution and 
their profiles. Two superficial gas velocities (5 and 3 0 cm/s) were examined  in this 
assessment , where the CT scan was repeated twice in two different times to demonstrate 
the reproducibility of the CT experimental results.  
 The obtained experimental results in terms of  the time-averaged cross -sectional 
gas ho ldup distributions and their azimuthal average diametrical profiles are presented  in 
Figure 5 and Figure 6. As seen in these figures , the cross -sectional gas holdup distributions 233 
 
 
 that were  measured and reconstruc ted for experiment s Nos. 1, and 2 for either superficial 
gas velocities of 5 or 30 cm/s were  qualitatively identical. Moreover, the azimuthal average  
of the gas holdup profiles of experiments No s. 1, and 2 for the same oper ating conditions 
(at either superficial gas velocit y 5 or 30 cm /s) were  very similar  along the diameter of the  
bubble column, indic ating the high precision and reliability of the CT measurements.  
 For instance, the average absolute relative difference ( AARD) between two profiles 
for each superficial gas velocity was calculated using  Eq. 2, and it was found to be 2.17% 
and 3.47% for superficial gas velocit ies of 5 and 30 cm, respectively.

where 𝜀1(𝑟) and 𝜀2(𝑟) represent the gas holdup values of experiment No.  1 and No.  2, 
respectively , at the corresponding  dimensionless radius positions, while N represents the 
number of data points along the diameter  of the column.  
 Furthermore, the standard deviation ( SD), which represents the deviation of the 
measured values of the gas holdup from the mean 〈𝜀〉 of these values along the diametrical 
profiles, was also calculated by Eq. 3. 
𝑆𝐷=√1
𝑁−1∑(𝜀𝑖−〈𝜀〉)2𝑁
𝑖=1 (3) 
 It was found  that SD values were  minimal , within 0.005 and 0.011 for the 
superficial gas velocit ies of 5 and 30 cm/s, respectively. The values of SD for the gas 
holdup profiles were  inconsiderable, as exhibited in Figure 7; therefore,  the error bars , 
which represent the standard deviation , are not plotted in the subsequent figures of the gas 
holdup profiles.  234 
 
 
  However, each scan was replicated twice, and the average of the gas holdup of 
these replications was  estimated and plotted in this study to che ck the reproducibility of 
every experiment. The obtained values of the AARD and SD for the gas holdup profiles 
indicate that the CT measurements are highly reproducible (i.e., high ly precis e).  
The bed expansion t echnique for calculating the overall gas holdup (Eq. 4) was also 
employed  in this work as another independent method to check the accuracy of the CT 
results.

where R represents the radius of the bubble column  and 𝜀(𝑟) represents the values of the

There was good agreement between the  results of the comparison between the 
overall and the average of the cross -sectional gas holdup values, with an absolute relative 
difference of 2.63% and 3.28% for the superficial gas velocit ies of 5 and 30 cm/s , 
respectively.  
The dynamic  height of the bed was held constant at an axial level of 2.67 m above 
the gas distributor , while the static height of the liquid was varied  according to the operating 
conditions (i.e., at a superficial gas velocity of 5 or 30 cm/s).  
 
 235 
 
 
  It was demonstrated  in our previous work that this will not affect the 
hydrodynamics of the fully developed flow region.  The static and dynamic heights in these 
experiments were monitored and measured visually using a measuring tape, which was 
attached and pasted to the wall  of the bubble column.

 3.2. IMAGING GAS -LIQUID DISTRIBUTIONS IN 18 -INCH BUBBLE 
COLUMNS EQUIPPED WITH AND WITHOUT INTERNAL S AT 
DIFFERENT SUPERFICIAL GAS VELOCITIES  
One of the most important  features of the CT technique in the field of multiphase 
flow is its capability to visualize and quantify the phase distribution over the column CSA , 
which is essential for evaluat ing the performance of reactors. Therefore, for the first time, 
the gas holdup distributions in a large -scale bubble column equipped densely with vertical 
internals were vis ualized in a noninvasive way using an advanced CT technique . Figure 8 
displays the time -averaged cross -sectional gas holdup distributions for 18-inch diameter  
bubble columns with and with out vertical internals arranged in a circular or hexagonal 
shape over the CSA  of the column at different operating conditions (i.e., at superficial gas 
velocit ies of 5, 30, and 45 cm/s).  It is evident from Figure 8 that the  gas holdup distributions 
of the bubble columns with and without vertical internals were  almost distributed 
symmetrically over the entire CSA  of the bubble column for  all the studied superficial gas 
velocit ies. Still, the phenomena of more gas at the cente r and less gas in the wall region of 
the bubble column in the absence of vertical internals persist ed in the large -scale bubble 
column equipped densely with vertical internals , for both circular and hexagonal 
configurations.  
For hexagonally arranged vertic al internals, a notable increase in the gas holdup 
magnitude was observed  in the wall region of the column, which is located  in the space 
between the bundle of vertical internals and the wall of the column , unlike in the circular 
configuration. This available space (i.e., the clearance between the column wall and the 
bundle of internals , which is larger than that of the circular configuration ) provides less 
resistance to the flow ; hence , this might allow small bubbles to  move to the region and rise 239 
 
 
 more freely than when bubbles move in the gaps between the vertical internals.  As a result , 
the accumulation of small bubbles in this clearance lead s to an increase in the gas holdup 
in this region.  A similar observation was also reported by Youssef et al.  32 and Kagumba  
39 when they measure the loc al gas holdup in an 18-inch bubble column with vertical 
internals for an air -water system using a four-point optical fiber probe.  
In comparison with the bubble column without vertical internal tubes, the 
uniformity of the gas holdup distribution over the e ntire CSA  of the columns in the 
presence of the vertical internals was enhanced  for both configurations  of internals. 
However, the hexagonal arrangement of the vertical internals provide d a more 
homogeneous gas distributed over the column ’s CSA  as compared  to the column with the 
circular arrangement or without vertical internals.  
To provide a further confirmation of this observation , a uniformity  factor ( F) of the 
gas holdup distribution over the  entire  CSA  of the bubble columns with and without 
vertical internals was calculated  by using the following equation:  
𝐹=1
𝑁∑ (𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗−𝜀𝑎𝑣𝑔
𝜀𝑎𝑣𝑔)2 𝑁
𝑖,𝑗=1 (6) 
𝜀𝑎𝑣𝑔=1
𝑁∑ 𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗𝑁
𝑖,𝑗=1 (7) 
Eq. 6  was built based on the deviation of a gas holdup in each pixel  (𝜀𝑔,𝑖𝑗) from the 
average of the cross -sectional (𝜀𝑎𝑣𝑔) gas holdup, where the smaller values  of the uniformity  
factor (close to zero) indicate a uniform gas holdup distribution . The presence of vertical 
internal tubes arranged either circularly or hexagonally significantly improved  the 
distribution of the gas phase over the CSA  of the columns at the churn turbulent flow 240 
 
 
 regime (i.e., particularly at the superficial gas velocit ies of 30 and 45 cm/s) . This observed 
enhancement in the uniformity of the gas holdup  distribution could be attributed to the 
existence of these vertical internal tubes , which  help to spread the gas towards the column 
wall. However, the bubble column with a ci rcular configuration provide d nonuniform 
distribution at a low su perficial gas velocity (5 cm/s) compared to the other bubble columns 
(i.e., the column without vertical internals  or the column with the hexagonal arrangement). 
This might result from  the geometric configuration  because a flow does not fully develop  
under this condition (i.e., the effect of the entrance of column and the vertical internals still 
dominat e at a low superficial gas velocity ). According to the uniformity factor (F) of gas 
holdup distribution values , which  are calculated and tabulated in Table 1, better distribution 
of the gas holdup over the entire CSA  was achieved with the hexagonal configuration , 
which ha d low F values compared to the other bubble columns ( i.e., with a circular 
configuration or without vertical internals). From an industrial point of view, a uniform 
distribution (i.e., gas distributed homogeneously over  the entire cross -sectional area of the 
column) is essential to achieve optimal reactor performance. For instance, a high -quality 
and efficien t chemical reaction can only be achieved through homogen eous gas holdup 
distribution along the liquid phase in the bubble column or slurry phase (liquid -catalyst) in 
a slurry bubble column . This occurs  because  the homogen eous gas holdup distribution 
leads to better interaction between phases, which is necessary for the chemical reaction. In 
contrast, the nonhomogeneou s gas holdup distribution over the entire CSA  of the column 
causes poor contact between other phases ( liquid or slurry phases), which accelerat es the 
reaction in some regions, while slow ing in other areas of the reactor , which  consequently  
negatively  affect s the reactor’s  performance.   241 
 
 
 More interestingly, the average of the cross -sectional gas holdup distributions for 
bubble columns with and without vertical internal tubes were very similar,  as presented in 
Table 2. Therefore, these results confirm the findings obtained recently by Kagumba and 
Al-Dahhan 33 and Al Mesfer et al. 36, who reported that at the churn turbulent flow regime, 
the gas holdup that was achieved in the bubb le column in the absence of vertical internals  
could be extrapolated to the columns with vertical internals . However, this could only occur  
when these columns with internals were  operated at the same superficial gas velocity but 
calculated based on the fre e CSA  for the flow.  This finding is particularly noteworthy 
because it was achieved in 6-inch bubble columns , while in the current  work the same 
observation was obtained in 18 -inch bubble columns.

 3.3. EFFECT OF THE VERTICAL INTERNAL TUBES AND THEIR 
ARRANGEMENTS ON THE DIAMETRICAL GAS HOLDUP PROFILES IN 
AN 18 -INCH DIAMETER BUBBLE COLUMN AT DIFFERENT 
SUPERFICIAL GAS VELOCITIES  
Figure 9-11 show  the comparison between the azimuthal average  of the  gas holdup 
profiles for the 18-inch bubble columns in the presence or absence vertical internal tubes 
(i.e., circular and hexagonal  arrangements) at different superficial gas velocit ies, namely 
5, 30 , and 45 cm/s. The superficial  gas velocity for the bubble column without vertical 
internal tubes was calculated based on the total CSA  of the column, while it was computed  
with respect to  the free passing CSA  for the columns equipped with vertical internal tubes. 
From  Figure 9, it is evident that the circular and hexagonal configurations of the vertical 
internals at a superficial gas velocity of 5 cm/s provide d lower  diametrical gas holdup 
profiles compared to those of the bubble column without ver tical internals, which produce d 
a higher gas holdup profile s at all radial positions . However, the hexagonal configuration 
produces higher gas holdup than the circular configuration . Both the circular and hexagonal 
configurations had the same number of vertical internals and the same size of vertical 
internals (i.e., 1 -inch diameter); also, the vertical internals occluded the same CSA 
(approximately 25% of the total CSA of the column) . Therefore,  the mean s of the gas 
holdup profiles for these configurations as well as for the column without vertical internals 
were computed to analyze whether they provide d similar gas holdup profiles at a studied 
superficial gas velocity.  For instance, at a superficial gas velocity of 5 c m/s, the mean of 
the gas holdup profile in the bubble column with the hexagonal configuration increased by 
36% with respect to  the column with the circular arrangement . As seen in Figure 9, the 
behavior of the circular configuration was significantly different than the hexagonal 
configuration , which had the same occupied CSA and the same diameter of vertical 244 
 
 
 internals . This observed difference in the behavior of the configurations could result from  
the difference in the geometry of the configuration s (i.e., the compartment between tubes, 
the pitch of tubes).  Figure 10 and Figure 11 display the azimuthal  average of the  gas holdup 
profiles for the bubble columns with and without vertical internals in the deep  churn  
turbulent flow regime at superficial gas velocit ies of 30 and 45 cm/s. A closer analysis of 
these figures reveals that the configuration ’s impact on the gas h oldup profiles is 
insignificant under a deep churn turbulent flow regime. For example, the absolute relative 
difference between the means of the gas holdup profiles for the bubble column with the 
circular configuration and the column without vertical inter nals was 0.13% and 4.16% , 
respectively,  at a superficial velocity of 30 and 45 cm/s, respectively. However, for the 
hexagonal arrangement, the absolute  relative difference was 8.94% and 9.38 %, 
respectively , for the column without vertical internals at a superficial gas velocity of 30 
and 45 cm/s, respectively. This convergence of the gas holdup values between the bubble 
columns with and without vertical internals suggests that the impact of the presence of 
vertical internals and their configurations on the gas holdup profiles is insignificant under 
deep churn turbulent flow regime . This is  particularly  true at the superficial gas velocit ies 
of 30 and 45 cm/s , when it was  calculated based on the free CSA  for the f low, not based 
on the total CSA  of the column.  These findings of convergence between the values of the 
gas holdup in the 18 -inch bubble column with and without vertical internals were  also 
obtained in a 6-inch bubble column as reported by Kagumba  33  and Al Mesfer  38. 
Additionally, Figure 10 and Figure 11 illustrate  that the gas holdup values for the bubble 
column with the hexagonal configuration were  comparatively higher than those in either 
the column with the  circular shape or the  column without vertical internals near the wall 245 
 
 
 region. For instance, it was found that at a superficial gas velocity of 45 cm/s , the 
percentag e of increase in the  gas holdup in the wall region (r/R  = 0.925) of the bubble 
column with the hexagonal configuration was 40.82%  compared to the column with the 
circular arrangement and 50.82%  in relation to the column without vertical internals.  The 
reason for this enhancement of gas holdup values with the hexagonal configuration in the 
wall region could relate to  the larger  space (i.e., missing tubes in this area ; see Figure 12) 
that exists between the vertical internals bundle and the column wall compared to the 
circular configuration , as explained earlier.  This observation agree s with Kagumba ’s study, 
which includ ed measuring the bubble properties  (e.g.,  the specific interfacial area, axial 
bubble velocity, bubble passage frequency, and bubble chord length ) in an 18-inch bubble 
column equipped densely with vertical internals using a four-point optical fiber probe. 
Kagumba 39 reported that smaller bubbles chord lengths were obtained  in the wall region 
of the bubble column based on the insertion of vertical internals. Additionally, a notable 
decrease in the bubble rise velocity was obtained in the wall region of the bubble column 
with vertical internals. This reduction in the bubble cord length and bubble rise velocity 
cause d an increase in the residence time of the bubbles , which  explain s the increase in the 
gas holdup in the wa ll region.  
The gas holdup profiles  show  that the bubble column with the hexagonal 
arrangement of vertical internals provide d higher gas holdup values at the center region 
and under a high superficial gas velocity (i.e., under a churn turbulent flow regime)  as 
compared to other bubble columns. For instance, at a superficial gas velocity of 45 cm/s 
and dimensionless radius (r/R) of 0.075, there  was a 13.94% increase in the gas holdup 
with the hexagonal as compared to the circular configuration. Th e rise in the gas holdup 246 
 
 
 for the hexagonal arrangement in the center region could result from the missing vertical 
tube (gap) in this area  in the hexagonal configuration compared to the circular 
configuration , which has a central tube in this region. This observatio n was also reported  
by Kagumba  33, who measured the local gas holdup and bubble properties (e.g., specific 
interfacial area, axial bubble velocity, bubble passage frequency, and bubble chord lengths) 
in the same system and operating condition using a four-point fiber optical probe techniq ue. 
Additionally, the shapes of the gas holdup profiles of the bubble columns were  different ; 
For example, the bubble column without vertical internals produce d a parabolic shape 
profile, while the bubble column with vertical internals generated  a wavy sha pe profile. 
However, the shape of the gas holdup profile in the bubble column with the circular 
configuration produce d a wavier curve than the hexagonal configuration. This variation in 
the degree of the wavy curve between the gas holdup profiles resulted from  (1) different 
arrangements of the vertical internals , and (2) the fact that  the hexagonal configuration ha d 
compartments  of uniform size,  and (3) the degree of  pitch between the internals as 
compared to the circular configuration.  For industrially important  arrangements of vertical 
internal tubes, the influence of a configuration can be considered  significant  at a low 
superficial gas velocity, whereas it is deemed insignificant at high superf icial gas velocities 
(deep  in the churn turbulent flow regime) ; these velocities  should be  calculated based on 
the free CSA  for the flow.  
The design and scale -up of bubble/slurry bubble columns are challenging tasks due 
to the complex interaction that exists among the phases in these reactors. However, the 
presence of a bundle of heat -exchanging tubes inside these reactors for highly exothermic 
reactions further increase s this complexity and also alters the hydrodynamic s, intensity of 247 
 
 
 the liquid or slurry mixing, and heat and mass transfer rates , all of which affect the 
performance of these reactors. Therefore, further experimental investigations must be 
performed to investigate, analyze , and quantify the impact of the presence of vertical 
internals on the hydrodynamics of these reactors. These inv estigations are necessary for 
the design  and scale -up of these reactors as well as to develop and validate reactor 
simulations or models. Lab-scale, pilot -scale, and industrial scale experimental studies are 
under investigation in our mReal laboratory , where an advanced radioactive particle 
tracking (RPT) technique is used to investigate the impact of these vertical internal tubes 
and their arrangements on the liquid velocity field and turbulence parameters ( e.g., 
Reynolds stresses, turbulent kinetic energy , and turbulent eddy diffusivities).  These 
experimental investigations will be reported  in future papers.

3.4. IMPACT OF THE SIZE OF THE BUBBLE COLUMNS ON THE GAS 
HOLDUP DISTRIBUTION AND THEIR PROFILES  
The s cale-up process of the bubble/slurry b ubble columns in the absence of heat -
exchanging tubes is a challenging task that becomes more difficult  in the presence of 
vertical tubes due to the absence of a reliable phenomenological model that can predict the 
hydrodynamic parameters of these rectors and also  due to  the lack of experimental 
investigations of these columns with heat -exchanging tubes.  Therefore, in th e current 
study, the effect of the bubble column size on the gas holdup in the bubble columns with 
and without vertical internals at different superficial gas velocities was addressed to 
support the scale -up process because  there is a lack of benchmark data to evaluate and 
verify the prediction of any scale -up methods for these kinds of reactors.

  The sub sequently presented figures represent the gas holdup distributions and their 
profiles for 18 -inch bubble columns with and without vertical internals as well as results 
of gas holdup distributions and their profiles for 6 -inch bubble columns with and withou t 
vertical internals, which were recently published  70. 
Figure 13 shows the comparison of gas holdup distributions over the entire CSA  
and their diametrical profiles of two sizes (6 - and 18 -inch in the diameter) of bubble 
columns without vertical internals , operated under two superficial gas velocities (i.e., 5 and 
45 cm/s).  It is clear from the gas holdup distribution figures (Figure 13a, b, c, and d ) that 
the gas phase was symmetrically and uniformly distributed  over the CSA  for both 
diameters of the columns. However, the larger  bubble column (i.e., 18 -inch diameter) was 
found to significantly enhance the gas phase distribution over the CSA  of the column.  
 For example, the uniformity factor decreased by 39.361% and 44.18% when an 18-
inch bubble column was used under the superficial gas velocities of 5 a nd 45 cm/ s, 
respectively. Additionally, the impact of the size of the  column on the magnitude of the 
gas holdup was found to be significant at a low superficial gas velocity (5 cm/s), while it 
was insignificant at a high superficial gas velocity (45 cm/s), as displayed in Figure 13e. 
For instance, the average absolute relative differences between the two profiles were 
40.12% at a superficial gas velocity of 5 cm/s, but 10.08% at a superficial gas velocity of 
45 cm/s.  
Contrary to the impacts of the size of the bubble column without ve rtical internals 
on the cross -sectional gas holdup distribution at a low superficial gas velocity (i.e., 5 cm/s), 
the larger  bubble column equipped densely with vertical internals arranged in a circular 
configuration notably increased  the non -uniformity of  the gas phase distribution. For 251 
 
 
 example, the unifor mity factor increased by 25.36% compared to the 6 -inch bubble  column 
with vertical internals arranged circularly.  
However, the 18 -inch bubble  column with vertical internals arranged in a circular 
configu ration was found to improve  the gas phase distribution over the entire CSA  of the 
column  under a high superficial gas velocit y, as shown in Figure 14. For instance, the 
uniformity factor was reduced by 38.67% when the larger  bubble column with vertical 
internals was used  compared to the 6-inch bubble  column with vertical internals arranged  
in a circular configuration.  
 Moreover, the magnitude of  the gas holdup profiles was significantly influenced 
by the size of the bubble column with vertical internal  tubes (i.e., vertical internal tubes 
arranged in a circular configuration) under a low superficial gas  velocity (i.e., 5 cm/s), 
while less effect was observed at a high superficial gas velocity (i.e., 45 cm/s), as presented 
in Figure 14e. 
 For example, the average absolute relative difference between the profiles of 
different size s of the bubble column with vertical internals was 191.03% and 19.49% for 
low and high superficial gas velocities, respectively. Interestingly, the gas holdup profiles 
for the 6-inch and 18 -inch bubble column s with vertical internals were very similar  at a 
high superficial gas velocity , except in the core region of the column , due to the presence 
or absence of the central tube for both sizes of bubble columns.  
Similar to the impact of the size of the bubble columns in the absence of vertical 
internals on the  gas holdup distribution, the impact of the size of the bubble columns with 
vertical internals arrang ed in a hexagonal configuration significantly enhanced  the gas 
holdup distribution over the entire CSA  of the columns ; this occurred  under both low and 252 
 
 
 high superficial gas velocities, as shown in Figure 15. For example, the uniformity factor 
decreased  by 29.42% and 44.93% at superficial gas velocities of 5 and 45 cm/s , 
respectively . 
 Additionally,  for the hexagonal configuration,  the effect o f the size of the bubble 
column on the magnitude of the gas holdup profiles was significant at a low superficial  gas 
velocity, while it was insignificant at a high superficial gas velocity , as displayed in Figure 
15e. For example, the average absolute relative difference between the gas holdups profiles 
for different size s of the bubble columns with a hexagonal configuration were 81.8% and 
10.9% at superficial gas velocities of 5 and 45 cm/s, respectively.  
 In summary,  increasing the size of the bubble column without vertical internals 
enhances the gas holdup distribution significantly over the entire CSA  of the columns. 
Additionally, the gas phase distributions are further improved when a larger  bubble column 
with vert ical internals (arranged either circularly or hexagonally over the CSA of the 
column)  was used , except in the larger  bubble column with the circular configuration at a 
low superficial gas velocity. However, the 18 -inch bubble column with vertical internals  
arranged in a hexagonal shape provide d the best  gas holdup distribution  in comparison with 
the bubble column with and with out vertical internal s arrang ed in a circular configuration.  
Furthermore, the impact of the size of the bubble columns with and without vertical 
internals on the gas holdup magnitude was remarkabl e at a low superficial gas velocity , 
while it was insignificant at high superficial gas velocities , which agree s with the findings 
of Youssef et al. 32, and Forret et al. 71.

 4. REMARKS  
This investigation  marks the first time that advance d gamma -ray computed 
tomography was used to investigate the influence of a configuration design of vertical 
internals on the gas holdup distribution over the entire cross -sectional area of a large -scale 
bubble column under  different superficial gas velocit ies, cover ing the homogenous and 
heterogeneous flow regime s. This study examined two configurations (i.e., circular and 
hexagonal arrangement s of vertical internals) where the  vertical internals occupied the 
same amount of  CSA  (approximately 25% of the total CSA  of the column, targeting the 
Fischer -Tropsch synthesis), with the same number and size of the vertical internal tubes. 
In addition , the obtained results in the 18 -inch bubble column with and without vertical 
interna ls were compared  with results achieved in the 6 -inch bubble column with and 
without vertical internals to understand  and assess the effect of the size of the reactor on 
the gas holdup distribution for bubble column s with and without vertical in ternals.  The key 
results and findings of the current investigation can be summarized as follows:  
➢ Symmetrical gas holdup distributions over the entire CSA  of the bubble columns with 
and without vertical internal tubes were obtained  for all studied superficial gas 
veloc ities, except that the  bubble column with the circular configuration displayed a 
nonsymmetrical distribution at a low superficial gas velocity (5 cm/s).  
➢ The well -known phenomenon in bubble column s without vertical internal tubes , where 
more gas resides at the center  region and less gas at the wall region , persist ed in the 
large -scale bubble column equipped densely with vertical internals for both 
configurations . 257 
 
 
 ➢ For all studied superficial gas velocities, t he presence of vertical internals arranged 
circularly or hexago nally inside the bubble columns enhanced the gas holdup 
distribution over the entire CSA of the bubble column compared with the column 
without vertical internals . 
➢ For all in vestigated operating conditions, better gas holdup distributions were obtained 
in the bubble column with a hexagonal configuration (i.e., the gas phase  was more 
homogeneously distributed over the CSA of the bubble column) compared to other 
bubble columns . 
➢ Interestingly, the averages of the  cross -sectional gas holdup s and their profiles for the 
bubble column s with and without vertical internals were  similar  to one other when the 
bubble column with the vertical internals operat ed at a high superficial gas velocity that 
was calculated based on  the free CSA  for the flow.  
➢ At a superficial gas velocity of 5 cm/s, there was a significant decrease in the gas holdup 
values for the circular and hexagonal configuration as compared to the column without 
vertical internals . 
➢ A significant increase in the gas holdup values was obtained in the bubble column with 
the hexagonal arrangement of internals at the center and the wall regions and under a 
churn turbulent flow regime due to an absence of vertical internals in these areas.  
➢ The shapes of the gas holdup profiles for the bubble column in the presence and absence 
of vertical internals differe d. For example, the bubble column without vertical internals 
produce d a parabolic profile, while the columns with vertical internals provi ded wavy  
profile s. However, the circular configuration offer ed more wavy  profile s than the 
hexagonal arrangement.  258 
 
 
 ➢ The effect of the configuration design on the gas holdup values was significant at a low 
superficial gas velocity, while it was insignificant at high superficial gas velocities that 
were calculated based on the free CSA  for the flow.  
➢ Increasing the size of the bubble column in the absence of vertical internals improve d 
the gas holdup distr ibution significantly over the entire CSA of the columns. In 
addition, the gas holdup distributions were  further enhanced when a larger bubble 
column with vertical internals (arranged either circularly or hexagonally over the 
column’s CSA ) was used , except  in the case of  the larger bubble column with the 
circular configuration under a low superficial gas velocity.  
➢ The 18 -inch bubble column with internals arranged in a hexagonal configuration 
produce d better gas holdup distribution over the entire CSA  of the column than the 
column with and with out vertical internal s organized in a circular shape.  
➢ The influence of the diameter of the bubble columns in the presence  and absence of the 
vertical internals on the gas holdup magnitude was notabl e at a low superf icial gas 
velocity but insignificant at high superficial gas velocities . 
➢ The obtained results in terms of  the gas holdup distribution s and their diametrical 
profiles for different configuration designs can serve as benchmark data to evaluat e and 
validate CFD simulation toward better prediction of hydrodynamic parameters in 
bubble columns equipped with vertical internals. Once the CFD simulation  is validated 
against the benchmark data, it can be used as a depend able tool to advance the 
fundam ental understanding of these reactors without conducting expensive 
experiments. Additionally, it can be employed  to design, scale -up, and evaluate the 
performance of these reactors.  259

SECTION  
2. RECOMMENDATIONS  
This w ork has generated for the first time benchmarking data and enhanced the 
fundamental understa nding of the hydrodynamics of bubble columns in the presence of 
vertical internal tubes. However, despite all of this  investigation, many things remain 
unaddressed and unexamined. These unaddressed areas  would make great research topics 
that will contribute to further improv ing the fundamental understanding and knowledge of 
this research area. Below are some suggestions that have been made  for future work to be 
performed.  
1. Investigating the impacts of the presence of vertical internal tubes and their 
configurations on the 3D liquid velocity and turbulence parameters (Reynolds 
stresses, turbulent kinetic energy, and turbule nt eddy diffusivities) in small and 
large -scale bubble columns (18 -inch and 24 -inch diameter column) by using 
radioactive particle tracking (RPT) technique. Where the new structure and 
calibration device for RPT has been manufactured and tested in our labo ratory that 
can handle these sizes.  
2. Visualizing and quantifying the cross -sectional gas and solid holdup distributions 
and their profiles in slurry bubble columns with and without vertical internals by 
using our dual -source gamma -ray computed tomography technique.  
3. Identifying flow regimes i n a bubble column equipped densely with a bundle of 
heat-exchanging tubes, particularly for large size bubble columns (18 and 24 -inch 
in diameter) and how they are compared to the small size columns.  266 
 
4. Building and developing a 3D CFD simulation for a bubbl e column with vertical 
internals and validating this simulation against the benchmarking data of the current 
study.  
5. Examining the influence of the clearance height between vertical internal tubes and 
the gas distributor on the cross -sectional gas phase di stribution, bubble dynamics, 
and heat transfer coefficient.  
6. Evaluating the effects of the bottom -end shape of vertical internal tubes (i.e., U 
shape, flat shape, and tapered shape) on the gas holdup distribution and their 
profiles, bubble properties, mass  transfer coefficient, and heat transfer coefficient 
in bubble and slurry bubble columns.   
7. Studying the impact of vertical internal tubes on the hydrodynamics of the bubble 
columns under relevant industrial conditions (i.e., Fischer -Tropsch conditions), 
using mimicked liquid of similar physical properties, operating under high 
temperature, pressure, and loading of the fine catalyst.  
8. Investigating the hydrodynamics of the bubble/slurry bubble columns with and 
without vertical internal tubes operating under a low aspect ratio (L/D) by using 
non-invasive techniques (i.e., CT and RPT).  267 
 
 
 APPENDIX  
STUDY THE IMPACT OF SIZE OF HEAT EXCHANGING TUBES 
(INTERNALS) ON THE LIQUID VELOCITY FIELD AND TURBULENT 
PARAMETERS IN BUBBLE COLUMN WITH INTERNALS BY USING 
RADIOACTIVE PARTICLE TRACKING (RPT) TECHNIQUE  
The focus of this study is to investigate and quantify, for the first time, the effects 
of the dense vertical internals and their sizes on the liquid velocity field and turbulence 
parameter profiles (Reynolds stress and ki netic energy profiles) in a bubble column with 
and without internals using advanced measurement technique (RPT).  
Radioactive Particle Tracking (RPT) Technique  
RPT is a powerful technique for mapping the Lagrangian trajectory of a particular 
phase in a give n system by tracking a single radioactive particle, which should match the 
density of the studied phase, with the aid of an array of scintillation detectors located 
strategically around the sys tem.  
From the Lagrangian trajectory, vital information can be extracted in the form of 
the velocity field, turbulence parameters, residence time distribution, stagnant zones, and 
many others. This technique includes a fully automatic calibration device (r, z, and θ), a 
signal processing, and data acquisition system, as seen in Figure 1. 
Arrangement of detectors in RPT experiments  
Twenty -eight of NaI scintillation detectors were strategically arranged around the 
6-inch bubble column in this investigation as shown in Table 1. It is important to mention 
that all these detectors were located in the fully developed flow regime as displayed in 
Figure 2.

Capsulation of the radioactive particle  
In this study, Cobalt -60 with an activity of about 200 µCi and a 600 -µm diameter 
was used in all RPT experiments. Cobalt has a half -life of 5.28 years and presents two 
photopeaks, one at 1.18 MeV and one at 1.34 MeV. Since the Cobalt has a high density 
(i.e., 8.9 g/cm3), therefore, it was encapsulated with air in a polypropylene ball with a 2 -
mm outer diameter to obtain a composite particle density similar to the water density, as 
shown in Figure 3. It is important to mention that the process of the encapsulation of the 
radioactive particle was supervised by the Environmental Health and Safety Department at 
Missouri University of Science and Technology (Missouri S&T).  
270

Experimental procedure  for conducting RPT experiments  
RPT experiments typically consist of two steps as follow:  
1. RPT calibration (static experiment under the experimental conditions),  
2. RPT experiment (dynamic experiment).  
During the calibration step, a single radioactive particle is placed inside a Teflon 
vial ( Figure 4a) and then attached to the rod ( Figure 4b) which connects to the automatic  
calibration device ( Figure 4c). The radioactive particle was m oved to se veral known 
locations ( Figure 4e) by using the automatic calibration device. During the residence of the 
radioactive particle in these known positions,  the detectors receive intensity counts, which 
depend on the distance between the radioactive particle and each detector. From the 
calibration step, a count -distance map ( Figure 4f) can be obtained, which will be used in 
the subsequent step to obtain the instantaneous locations of the particle.  During  the 
experimental run (i.e., dynamic experiment), the radioactive particle moves freely inside 
the bubble  column to track the liquid phase motion. The experiments were conducted for 
24 hours, and during this time, the radiation emitted by the radioactive particle was 
recorded by the detectors at a frequency of 50 Hz for each sampling instance.

 Subsequently, the instantaneous velocity is calculated by time differentiation of two 
succes sive positions of the particle. From the Instantaneous velocity time series, a rich 
database (liquid velocity field and turbulent parameters) is calculated by applying suitable 
post-processing (see Figure 5).
