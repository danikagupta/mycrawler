Phosphorus and nitrogen present in runo ff from agricultural land is a primary 
freshwater pollution source in southern Quebec. The focus of this study was to 
optimize a constructed wetland for use as a be st management practic e and the specific 
aim was to determine if substrate type  influences its phosphorus and nitrogen 
reduction capabilities. The p ilot-scale constructed wetland site was located 3 km 
north of McGill’s Macdonald campus in Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec, Canada. Three tank replicates filled with sandy clay loam soil,  and three with a sandy soil 
were planted with cattails ( Typha latifolia L.) and reed canary grass ( Phalaris 
arundinaceae  L.). From July to September 2007,  the tanks were flooded continuously 
with an artificial runoff wast ewater, containing 10 mg N L
-1 as nitrate 0.3 mg P L-1 as 
orthophosphate. Results show that there was no significant difference in P removal 
between the two soil types and both retain ed approximately 41%. The sandy clay 
loam soil outperformed the sandy soil in N removal, with 63% and 40% retained 
respectively.   IIRésumé 
Le phosphore et l'azote présents dans le s eaux de ruissellement provenant de 
terres agricoles cons tituent la source prédominent de pollution des eaux douces dans 
la partie méridionale du Québec. La prés ente étude visait à optimiser un marais 
artificiel en temps que pratique  de gestion optimale, et, en particulier, à déterminer si 
le genre de substrat sous-jacent influence la capacité du marais à réduire phosphore et 
d'azote dans les eaux. Une série de marais artif iciels construits à l'échelle pilote furent 
situés 3 km au nord du campus Macdonald de l'université McGill, à Sainte Anne-de-Bellevue, Québec, Canada. Des quenouilles ( Typha latifolia  L.) et de l'alpiste roseau 
(Phalaris arundinacea  L.) furent plantés dans trois ré pétitions-réservoirs sous-tendus 
par un loam sablo-argileux, ainsi que dans tr ois autres sous-tendus  par un sol sableux. 
De juillet à septembre 2007, les réservoirs furent inondés avec des eaux d'écoulement 
artificiels, contenant 10 mg N L
-1 sous forme de nitrates et 0.3 mg P L-1 sous forme 
d'orthophosphate. Aucune différence significati ve ne fut notée entre les deux types de 
sol quant à l'élimination du P, les deux ayant retenu environ 41% de celui-ci. Quant à 
l'élimination de l'azote, le loam sablo-argileux surclassa le sol sableux, retenant 63% 
de l'azote, comparé à 40%.  IIIThis work is dedicated to Colin Yates  IVAcknowledgements

   31. Chapter 1- Introduction 
1.1. The Problem 
Globally, irrigation and fertili zation of agricultural la nds is placing increasing 
pressure on water quality and availabili ty. Food production, with its attendant 
problem of phosphorus and nitr ogen runoff into fresh water, is one of the largest 
contributors to declining wa ter quality. The threat that agricultural nonpoint source 
pollution poses to freshwater reserves is  eutrophication, a pro cess whereby oxygen is 
depleted from the water, leading to outbr eaks of potentially toxi c blue-green algae. 
The algae ultimately renders the water unfit to support aquatic life,  and unusable for 
human activities.  Agriculture as a source of pollutants, and the social issues 
governing land and water use, are at the hear t of the vastly complex issue of water 
quality deterioration around the world. 
In North America, phosphorus, and nitrogen to a lesser extent, have been deemed 
the primary cause of surface water qual ity deterioration (USEPA, 1998; MENV, 
2002), with an estimated 70% of the phos phorus entering lakes in Quebec coming 
from agricultural nonpoint sources. A partic ularly sensitive watershed in Quebec is 
Missisquoi Bay, located on th e northeast corner of Lake  Champlain, where 79% of 
the phosphorus loads entering is coming from the 26% of the watershed that is used 
for agriculture (Michaud  et al. , 2005). Lake Champlain is on e of the largest lakes in 
North America and is shared between th e province of Quebec and the states of 
Vermont and New York. The three stakehol der groups recently signed an agreement 
establishing phosphorus load reduction goals  to be realized by 2009 (MENV, 2002). 
In order to reduce the P concen tration of Pike River, its main tributary on the Quebec 
side of the border, it is estimated that an annual reduction of 28 tons of phosphorus is 
necessary (Adhikari  et al. , 2007).  
 
1.2. Justification 
Agricultural best management practices  aimed at controlli ng nonpoint sources of 
phosphorus and nitrogen ar e classified in into two main groups: (1) prevention- at the 
level of soil management in terms of fer tilizing and tillage pract ices to reduce loss, 
and (2) correction- through the reduction of nutrients from water leaving the field via  4filtration structures (Kronvang  et al. , 2005). One such filtration structure is the 
constructed wetland. Construc ted wetlands can be used in a wide variety of 
applications to treat waste water; and thei r use in treating agricu ltural nonpoint source 
pollution specifically, is ga ining interest (Braskerud, 2002a). Constructed wetlands 
are an interesting nutrient mitigation stra tegy because of the low capital investment 
required for development and because they operate on the basis of harnessing 
processes endemic to natural wetlands. 
One of the challenges in designing a cons tructed wetland is aligning it with the 
local conditions in order to maximize its efficiency. In other words, constructed 
wetlands must be designed specifically for outcomes needed in each region in which they are to be implemented. 
This thesis is concerned with testing a pilot-scale constructed wetland to assess its 
efficiency at reducing phosphorus and nitrog en from agricultural runoff typical in 
Quebec. More specifically, we were inte rested in the influence on phosphorus and 
nitrogen retention within the wetland by two different soil substrates common in 
southern Quebec, in an effort to optimize the design as a best management practice in 
Quebec. 
 
1.3. Site location 
Field measurements were made at the pilot-scale, surface-flow constructed 
wetland research site, located 3km north of  McGill University’s Macdonald Campus 
in Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec, Canada. Th e site consisted of six open ditch-style 
tanks; three filled with a sa ndy soil and the other three wi th a sandy clay loam field 
soil (Figure 1.1).   5
 
Figure 1.1.  Constructed wetland research site diagram. (Not to scale). 
 
Each treatment tank was planted with reed canary grass ( Phalaris arundinaceae 
L.) and cattails ( Typha latifolia L.), and the water flowed fr om the deep zone, through 
the shallow vegetated secti on to the outlet (Figure 1.2). 
A simulated agricultural runoff solution containing 0.3 mg P L-1 as dissolved 
phosphorus and 10 mg N L-1 as nitrate, was flooded th rough the system continuously 
for three months. Measurements were taken to assess the efficiency of the load 
reduction and discern the processes by whic h this occurred. The P concentration of 
0.3 mg L-1 was chosen because it was 10 times great er than the threshold level of 0.03 
mg TP L-1 permitted to enter surface waters as de termined by the Quebec Ministry of 
Environment (2001). Levels found in non point  source agricultural runoff in Southern 
Quebec have been found above the 0.3 mg L-1 (Eastman, 2008). The nitrogen 
concentration of 10 mg N L-1 was chosen because it is the maximum allowable 
concentration in drinking water, howeve r it has been shown to be ecologically  6harmful at concentrations as low as 0.4 mg N L-1 in marine environments (Casey and 
Klaine, 2001).

1.4. Objectives 
The goal of this work was to provide design criteria for constructed wetlands 
treating agricultural non point source pollution in Quebec. This study was designed to 
determine if there was a difference in the ability of two soil types common to 
Southern Quebec to impact th e ability of a surface flow c onstructed wetland to reduce 
dissolved phosphorous and nitr ogen from a simulated agri cultural runoff solution.  
  7The primary objectives were: 
1. To discern the dominant phosphorus remova l mechanisms occurring within the   
wetland tanks of each soil type, a sandy cl ay loam field soil, and a sandy soil, 
2. To determine the hydraulic residence time of the wetland tanks and to measure if 
there was a difference in residence times between soil types, 3. To discern the dominant nitrogen re moval mechanism occurring within the 
wetland tanks of each soil type, and 4. To determine if the conditions necessa ry to promote denitrification were 
achieved, and if they differed between the two soil types. 
 1.5. Thesis Format 
Chapter two is a literature review of st udies addressing the is sue of agricultural 
nonpoint source nutrient pollution and how c onstructed wetlands function to remove 
nutrients from runoff. The objectives lis ted above were met by carrying out field 
measurements at the constructed wetland research site from July-October 2006 and 
June-October 2007. The results of the objectiv es are presented in two scientific 
papers and it is the intent ion of the authors to submit them for publication to peer 
reviewed scientific journals.  
The first two objectives are presented in  Chapter three entitled ‘Dissolved 
Phosphorus Reduction from Agricultural Runoff in a Surface-Flow Constructed 
Wetland’. This paper discusses the phosphorus  removal efficiencies by both soil types 
and how the physico-chemical conditions w ithin the tanks impacted the wetland’s 
ability to adsorb and retain phosphorus. It also discusses th e results of a conservative 
tracer test carried out to determine the mean hydraulic re sidence time of the treatment 
tanks.  
The last two objectives are presented in  Chapter 4 entitled ‘Comparison of Two 
Constructed Wetland Substrates for Reduc ing Nitrogen Load from Agricultural 
Runoff’. This paper presents the nitrogen removal capacity of the wetlands with the 
two different soil types and also explor es how the physico-chemical conditions 
influenced these results. It also assesses if there was a difference in the production of  8the denitrification by-pr oduct nitrous oxide, between the two soil types and the 
impact on nitrogen removal. 
 
1.6. Scope 
The research was carried was out in a controlled, pilot-scale wetland site. The site 
was exposed to environmental climatic c onditions however the simulated agricultural 
runoff solution was very closely controlled to meet the inflow target concentration of  
0.3 mg P L-1 and 10 mg N L-1. Runoff nutrient concentration at the field scale varies 
with precipitation and irrigation events, as well as fertilizer application schedules. 
The concentrations chosen for this study re present the high end of what is found in 
field scale runoff therefore the loads are realis tic. It is possible that once the system is 
scaled up, it will require further optimization to deal with variable flow rates and 
concentrations. 
  92. Chapter 2- Literature Review 
2.1. Nonpoint Source Pollution 
There are many sources of pollution that  led to both surface and ground water 
quality deterioration; they ar e generally classified as ei ther point source or non-point 
source (NPS). Point source pollution is any defined waste stream, either from an 
industrial, municipal or agri cultural source. NPS pollution is water pollution that does 
not originate from a defined point, but is  generated as a by-product of land use 
practices such as farming, timber ha rvesting, construction, mining and urban 
development.  
Pollutants such as sediment, fertilizers and pesticides are transferred from land to 
surface water and ground water by preci pitation, runoff or leaching (Zucker  et al. , 
2008). While there has been progress made in  treating and contro lling point sources 
of pollution in recent years, identifying  and treating NPS has posed a far greater 
challenge. The difficulty arises in isolating the contribution of dispersed sources in a 
scientific manner, particularly in areas of intensive agricultural operations (Berka and 
Schreier, 2001). 
 
2.2. Global Water Quality and Agriculture 
Water quality deterioration is a global issue that affects every single person on 
earth. According to the In ternational Fund for Agricu ltural Development’s Rural 
Poverty Portal, 70% of all available freshwat er is used for agricu lture and 37% of the 
Earth’s land area is used for pasture and crops (IFAD, 2008). Over-pumping of 
groundwater by the world's farmers exceeds natural replenishment by at least 
160 billion cubic meters a year and agricu ltural land area has increased 12% since the 
1960s, equivalent to 1.5 billi on hectares (IFAD, 2008). As the global demand for food 
continues to intensify, so does the necessity for irriga tion and chemical inputs, 
leading to poor drainage, over-pumping of  groundwater and over-use of fertilizers 
and pesticides (IFAD, 2008). The combinati on of these pressures exacerbates the 
resulting agricultural NPS pollution. The n ecessity to produce more and more food is  10increasing pressure on the world’s water reso urces and it is up to its stewards to 
discover ways to make food produc tion a sustainable endeavor.  
 Agricultural NPS pollution is usually in the form of runoff containing excess 
nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as pesticides. The threat to water 
resources caused by agriculturally sour ced NPS pollution is worldwide, as 
demonstrated by reports of declining wate r quality due to nutrient overloading from 
around the globe (Raisin and Mitchell, 1995;  Casey and Klaine, 2001; Kivaisi, 2001; 
Healy and Cawley, 2002; Kronvang  et al. , 2005; Michaud  et al. , 2005; Aye  et al. , 
2006; Litaor  et al. , 2006; Gentry  et al. , 2007). NPS phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) 
affect water quality in rivers, lakes, estuar ies and coastal ocean z ones. In freshwater 
lakes, excess nutrients, a nd P in particular, cause eutrophication (Carpenter  et al. , 
1998) In estuarine environments, excess N can  be toxic to seagrass which is a vital 
component to marine ecosystems (Casey and Klaine, 2001).  
Eutrophication, the process whereby a body of  water becomes rich in dissolved 
nutrients, results in the overgrowth of algae and weeds. The decomposition of over-
abundant plant life leads to a deficiency  of dissolved oxygen, effectively rendering 
the water inhospitable to aquatic life. In th e case of freshwater lakes, cyanobacteria 
outbreaks may occur, preventing any anthropog enic use of the lake such as drinking 
the water, swimming or fishing (Sharpley, 1995). 
 
2.3. Agricultural NPS Pollution in North America 
In North America, agricultural NPS pollution is considered one of the main 
causes of water quality deterioration and in 1996 the USEPA declared P the primary 
cause of surface water pollution in th e US (USEPA, 1998). In Quebec, nonpoint 
source P has been deemed the main source of P in Quebec surface water bodies 
(Ministry of Environment of Quebec, 1999). The Quebec Provincial Government 
imposed a maximum P concentration in Quebec rivers of 0.03 mg L-1, however levels 
as high as 0.2 mg L-1 have been found in Quebec ag ricultural watersheds (Adhikari  et 
al., 2007).   
The Mississquoi Bay watershed, which is lo cated on the northwest  corner of the 
Canadian section of Lake Champlain, is a particularly overloaded watershed. The  11water quality standard set by the Missisquoi  Bay Phosphorus Reduction Task Force is 
0.025 mg L-1 (Adhikari  et al. , 2007). Pike River, which is  a major tributary to the 
Missisquoi Bay, has a mean annual load of 28 tons of P which is 70% higher than 
what would be required to achieve th e water quality sta ndard of 0.025 mg L-1. 
Approximately 26% of the Missisquoi waters hed is agricultural land and yet it is 
estimated that 79% of this load is comi ng from agricultural non-point sources (La 
Flamme  et al. , 2004; Michaud  et al. , 2005). Therefore, reducing P in runoff has 
become a primary objective to combat surf ace water quality deterioration in Quebec. 
Excess nitrogen contributes to eutrophicat ion and decline in water quality as well; 
however P is considered rate-limiting to freshwater algae (Braskerud, 2002b). 
 
2.4. Mechanisms of NPS Pollution 
Agricultural intensification has led to the steady increase in P and N application to 
fields, in both chemical fertilizer and manur e form. As a result,  the surplus P and N 
content of the soil amplifies its vulnerability  to loss via leaching and erosion (Berka 
and Schreier, 2001; Kronvang  et al. , 2005). In areas where intensive livestock 
farming occurs, excess manure is often spread  on fields even when the crops do not 
require added additional nutrients. Surface so il accumulation of P due to continuous 
application of manure and/or chemical fertil izer has increased to such a level that P 
loss management has become a priority  (Sharpley, 1995). Surplus fertilizer 
application for cash crops such as corn and soybeans is common and in British 
Columbia’s Sumas River Watershed, surplus N application (as ma nure and fertilizer) 
of 300 kg ha-1 have been observed (Berka and Schreier, 2001).  
While surface-flow runoff and erosion ar e known export pathways of P and N, it 
is important to mention the contribution of  tile-drainage. Subsurface drainage, also 
known as artificial or tile-drainage is nece ssary in areas where the soil is poorly 
drained. This is the case in much of s outhern Quebec where upwards of 700,000 ha is 
necessarily tile-draine d. Studies from central  Illinois and the Amer ican Cornbelt have 
quantified nutrient losses from tile drains; for example between 1993 and 1996, P loss 
to, the upper Embarras River, where 70-85% of  the land is tile drained, was estimated 
at 0.9 kg ha-1 yr-1 with 46-59% of the dissolved P resulting from tile drainage. N  12losses averaged 39 kg ha-1 yr-1 and 68-91% was attributed to tile-drain loss (Kovacic  
et al. , 2000). Work is currently being conduc ted in the Missisquoi watershed to 
estimate the relative contributions  of surface and subsurface flow. 
 
2.4.1.  Mechanisms of Nitrogen Loss in Runoff 
Dissolved nitrogen is lost from fields pr imarily as dissolved nitrate due to its 
highly soluble nature. It can be leached out through subsurface dr ains or overland as 
surface runoff. Although artifici al drainage is necessary to lower water tables in 
poorly drained soils in order to farm them, it also forces NO 3- laden drainage water 
more rapidly and directly to receiving water bodies (Kovacic  et al. , 2000). Nitrogen 
fertilizer is most ofte n applied as ammonia (NH 4+); however, it is microbially 
oxidized to nitrite (NO 2-) then nitrate (NO 3-) ions within approximately 2 days. While 
ammonia is also highly soluble in water, its cationic nature allo ws it to bind loosely 
with cation exchange sites within the so il column, thus decreasing its likelihood of 
being washed away. Nitrate leaching occurs more readily during periods of slow or 
no crop growth and especially when coupled  with high volumes of percolating water 
(Miller and Gardiner, 1998).  
 
2.4.2.  Mechanisms of Phosphorus Loss in Runoff 
Phosphorous loss from agricultural fields occurs in dissolved and particulate 
form. Overland flow is generally th e dominant mechanism for P loss from 
agricultural fields; however, subsurface flow from tile drains has also been found to 
be an important transport conduit (Gentry  et al. , 2007). The concen tration of P in 
drainage water is heavily influenced by the soil P status and its capacity to retain 
phosphates (Aye  et al. , 2006). The phosphate retention capacity is affected by soil 
particle size and P buffering capacity of  the soil (Sharpley, 1995). Dissolved 
inorganic phosphorous is also known as sol uble reactive phosphorus (SRP), dissolved 
reactive phosphorus (DRP) and sometimes as  orthophosphate (ortho-P). Collectively 
they refer to bioavailable dissolved P and include inorga nic phosphate ions H 2PO 4-, 
HPO 42- and PO 43- (House  et al. , 1995). Particulate P on the other hand, is P bound to 
clay particles that are physically washed  off the fields and deposited wherever and  13whenever the water velocity is slowed  enough for the particles to settle out 
(Braskerud, 2002b). 
 
2.5. Best Management Practices 
Mitigation strategies, otherwise known as Best Management Practices (BMPs), to 
combat nutrient loss from agricultural fiel ds are split into two main groups: (1) soil 
management and the reduction of nutrient input to agricultural land, and (2) reduction 
of nutrient loss from high risk areas  via filtration st ructures (Kronvang  et al. , 2005). 
In an effort to reduce loss by erosion and leaching, soil nutrient levels can be 
managed through regular soil testing, type of fertilizer input, timing of the input, and 
incorporation and tilla ge practices (Gentry  et al. , 2007).  
In response to the public demand for ac tion at the government level to help 
regulate water quality issues, the Quebec Mi nistry of Environment issued a Quebec 
Water Policy directive in 2002 highlighting fi ve key orientations with the supporting 
courses of action and associated gover nment commitments (MENV, 2002). In 
Orientation 4, ‘Continued Clean-up and Im proved Management of Water Services: 
Recovering Lost Uses’, the government of Quebec states that it will introduce a 
strategy for cleaning up waterc ourses at the watershed level. This, they proclaim, 
includes intensifying agricu ltural clean-up efforts by i nvesting in soil support 
capacity, establishing wooded riparian co rridors and pesticide management.  
The Quebec government has also established a moratorium on any new pig 
farming operations in an effort to directly address the issue of P surpluses in surface 
water, and restrict the environm ental impact of this industry. 
Farm scale BMPs aimed at reducing nutri ent loads from runoff include riparian 
buffer strips, sediment control basins at su rface inlets, grassed waterways, water table 
management and constructed wetlands (Michaud  et al. , 2005; Stämpfli, 2006). 
 
2.5.1.  Constructed Wetlands as a Best Management Practice 
Constructed wetlands are an interesting BM P for targeting nutr ient reduction from 
NPS agricultural runoff because the concep t can be implemented in many different 
situations and built with materials availa ble locally (Casey and Klaine, 2001; Aye  et  14al., 2006). The convergence point of surface draina ge ditches or tile-drain outlets are 
likely positions for constructed wetland cons truction in order to trap the water and 
treat it before it escapes to the receiving water bodies. Constructed wetlands have 
been described as ‘environmentally sensit ive and cost-effective treatment systems for 
wastewater renovation’ (Hench  et al. , 2003). They can also can be thought of as 
‘ecological engineers’ (Tanner, 1996) b ecause the concept involves supplying the 
necessary components and capit alizing on the naturally occurring wetland processes 
to reduce the targeted pollutants. By understanding the components necessary to 
optimize these processes, including the hydrology, soil, vegetation and associated 
microbial populations, it is  possible to design and cons truct efficient, low-cost 
wastewater treatment systems (Vymazal, 2005).  
 
2.6. Constructed Wetland Design Components 
Constructed wetlands contain all the com ponents found in natural wetlands except 
with the option to control the location of th e inflow and the outflow. The flow regime 
and hydrology, soil substrate, vegetation a nd microbial communities all make up a 
wetland ecosystem and it is up to the desi gner to optimize the combination of all 
those components in order to maximize nutrient removal. 
 
2.6.1.  Constructed Wetland Flow Regimes 
Constructed wetlands (CWs) can be classi fied into two general categories based 
on flow regime: surface-flow and subsurface- flow (Hammer, 1992). They can then be 
subdivided based on vegetation into either emergent or submerged plants (Vymazal, 
2005). The most common design used for tr eating agricultural r unoff is a surface-
flow, emergent vegetation design. This is often referred to in the lite rature as FWS, or 
free water surface constructed wetlands. Subs urface-flow with emergent vegetation 
designs are often seen in st udies treating point source agricultural waste streams. The 
main difference between surface and subsurf ace-flow designs is the positioning of the 
outlet pipe. In surface-flow CW s, the inlet and outlet are placed at the same level, 
whereas in the subsurface-flow designs, th e outlet is placed below the level of the  15inlet, forcing the water to flow through the substrate before it exits (Kadlec and 
Knight, 1996). 
 Surface-flow constructed wetlands are us ually the design of choice for treating 
agricultural runoff because of lower instal lation costs and hydraulic simplicity as 
compared to subsurface-flow designs (Yang  et al. , 2001). Surface-flow CWs 
generally allow for particulate settling to occur without threat to  the hydrology of the 
system. In subsurface-flow CWs, clogging of  the substrate can be a problem. In 
systems where the oxidation-reduction poten tial is low, clogging may occur from 
biofilm growth on the substrat e particles and it may also occur if the incoming water 
is high in particulate matter. Where dissolv ed P is the primary target nutrient for 
reduction, subsurface-flow designs with hi gh-adsorption capacity substrates are 
usually studied (Jenssen  et al. , 2005).  
 
2.6.2.  Constructed Wetland Hydrology 
Treatment efficiency of constructed wetla nds is directly linked to the hydraulic 
efficiency and therefore the amount of tim e the polluted water spends in the wetland 
system (Kadlec, 1994; Werner  and Kadlec, 2000; Dierberg  et al. , 2005). For the 
sustainable and long term ope ration of constructed wetlands , it is essential that the 
hydrologic regime entering the wetland, as well as the within-wetland flow dynamics, 
be optimized.  
 
2.6.2.1.  Hydraulic Efficiency of Constructed Wetlands 
One of the major contributors to po or wetland performance (in terms of 
contaminant removal) is poor system hydrodynamics. Hydraulic efficiency is 
maximized when full use of the availabl e storage within the wetland is utilized 
(Persson  et al. , 1999).  
For constructed wetland desi gn, theoretical retention tim e is based on plug flow 
assumptions. The theoretical retention time of a constructed wetland system involves 
a simple calculation of volume divided by flow  rate; however, this fails to take into 
account the hydrological influences in th e system which govern water movement 
patterns and therefore the treatment time (Kadlec a nd Knight, 1996). Because of  16uncertainty in exact depth distribution, coupled  with variable inflow rates, the volume 
of a wetland is difficult to quantify; theref ore, a tracer study can be extremely useful 
in experimentally determining the residence time distribution.  
From the residence time distribution th e mean residence time can then be 
determined from the centroid of the distribut ion curve. This is the average amount of 
time each parcel of water spends in the wetland. Tracer test results are useful in 
distinguishing the difference between the th eoretical and actual retention times, as 
well as highlighting the possible hydraulic in fluences such as the active volume of the 
wetland.  
A primary factor influenc ing the residence time di stribution is the water 
movement patterns within th e wetland (Werner and Kadlec,  2000) which are dictated 
by the soil substrate, vegetation and bo ttom topography. This phenomenon has been 
described as ‘velocity hete rogeneity’. Ideally the spr ead of the residence time 
distribution, or velocity he terogeneity, should be reduced to maximize treatment 
efficiency (Wörman and Kronnäs, 2005). In su bsurface-flow designs, the influence of 
soil substrate on retention time is dictated  by the hydraulic conduc tivity of the soil. 
The conductivity of the clean substrate can be reduced over time due to blockage of 
pore space through the accumulation of organi c materials such as  plant roots. In 
surface-flow wetlands, the influence of the soil substrate is generally considered 
indirect as it affects the ve getation and microbial growth, which in turn influence the 
hydraulic retention time (Kadlec and Knight, 1996). 
Preferential flow paths which cause shor t-circuiting of the water often plague 
constructed wetlands, negatively impacti ng the residence time and therefore the 
treatment efficiency. Preferential flow pa ths are influenced by stagnant regions, 
velocity gradients and physical obstructions  within the wetland, often resulting in an 
actual retention time that is less than th e theoretical retention time (Shilton and 
Prasad, 1996; Smith  et al. , 2005c).  
Short-circuiting, also known as channeliz ation, has been shown to be reduced by 
incorporating transverse deep zones as bottom topography of a constructed wetland is 
highly influential on the hydraulic residence time.  
  172.6.2.2.   Constructed Wetland Bottom Topography 
Deep zones reduce incoming flow rates and aid the distribution of the water 
which alleviates short-circuiting and maxi mizes hydraulic residence time (Simi and 
Mitchell, 1999). Deep zones also direct flow distribution laterally, increase the 
wetland volume, and promote passive aeration of the water column.  
There is evidence that deep zones interspe rsed with shallow marsh zones has been 
demonstrated to positively impact mixi ng. As well, despite the lower volumetric 
removal rate within deep zones, their pres ence may decrease the outlet concentration 
thus improving the wetland performance (Lightbody  et al. , 2007).  
Lightbody et al.,’s (2007) study pointed out however, th at the location of the deep 
zone is important. They observed channe lization mitigation when a deep zone was 
placed in the middle of the wetland but no effect  from a deep zone placed at the outlet 
end of the wetland.  
Deep zones incorporated in the bottom topography may also increase mixing 
(Simi and Mitchell, 1999). Kadlec and Knight  (1996) explain that the intensity of 
mixing within the wetland increases with wate r velocity. It is likely that the degree of 
mixing is positively associated with increasi ng the active volume, also referred to as 
the effective volume ratio. Effective volume ratio is the measured retention time 
divided by the theoretical retention time . For open water surface flow wetlands, an 
effective volume ratio, or active zone, of 70% or greater is considered very good. 
Some researchers argue that any discrepancy between the mean and theoretical 
hydraulic residence time (ie an effective volum e ratio of less than 1) warrants design 
optimization (Smith et al., 2005a). 
 
2.6.2.3.   Vegetation Distribution in a Constructed Wetland 
In addition to incorporating deep zones within vegetated shallow zones, another 
proposed design consideration to reduce short- circuiting and dead-zones, is the spatial 
distribution of vegetation (Jenkins and Greenway, 2005). Wetland cells with greater 
length to width ratios have been cited to increase hydraulic efficiency (Persson  et al. , 
1999; USEPA, 2000), though Jenkins and Gr eenway (2005) have suggested that 
hydraulic efficiency will not be significantly  influenced by the length:width ratio in  18densely vegetated wetlands where channelization is present. They also argue that it is 
the spatial distribution of ve getation characteristics that are most influential on flow 
dynamics. A banded pattern across the wetla nd cell increases hydraulic efficiency 
drastically they contend, while fringing vegetation lengthwise al ong the cell promotes 
channelization, thus greatly re ducing hydraulic efficiency.  
It has also been suggested that eliminati ng corners from the tr aditional rectangular 
shaped design may help reduce the occurr ence of dead-zones within the wetland 
(Smith  et al. , 2005a), as well as incorporating an in flow manifold that distributes the 
incoming water at the inflow (Dierberg  et al. , 2005; Smith  et al. , 2005a). The 
effectiveness of a manifold was demonstrat ed by a tracer test  study conducted on a 
gravel bed wetland with and without a dist ribution manifold; the results indicated a 
20% increase in residence time when the inflow manifold was used (Shilton and 
Prasad, 1996).  
Shallow areas with emergent vegetation ha ve also been shown to encourage rapid 
particle settling from incoming water while  vegetation cover reduces the risk of 
sediment resuspension by wind shear (Braskerud, 2002b). 
 
2.6.2.4.   Constructed Wetland Flow Models 
 Developing mathematical models to desc ribe hydraulic regimes and contaminant 
removal kinetics continues to be a popular research area and advances are being made 
in understanding the hydraulic influen ce on contaminant removal mechanisms. 
Chemical engineering equations for plug- flow reactors (PFR) and continuously 
stirred tank reactors (CSTR) (Levenspiel, 1999) have been adopted to describe and 
model fluid dynamics within wetlands (Keefe  et al. , 2004). CSTR assumes 
instantaneous dispersion of the fluid within the wetland, and PFR assumes the inflow 
water moves along the wetland as a ‘plug’  with no longitudinal mixing occurring 
(Levenspiel, 1999).  
Original attempts by the USEPA at mode ling fluid behavior in wetlands were 
based on ideal PFR theory with results considered inaccurate by several groups 
during the early to mid-1990s (Werner a nd Kadlec, 2000). More recently, studies 
aimed at combining PFR and CSTR to descri be mixed and unmixed zone interactions  19are emerging. In reality, water flow with in constructed wetlands is ‘non-ideal’; 
somewhere between plug-flow and continuous ly stirred, resulting in water parcels 
remaining in the wetland for varying amounts of time.  
Tracer tests can be used to physically de termine the residence time distribution of 
the water within the constructed wetlands from which these models are based. From 
this information researchers are developi ng models to describe non-ideal flows and 
coupling them with contaminant decay kine tics to ultimately estimate and predict 
treatment efficiency (Kadlec and Knight , 1996; Werner and Ka dlec, 2000; Carleton, 
2002; Keefe  et al. , 2004). Contaminant decay rates have  been shown to be dictated by 
inflow concentrations and volumetric flow  rates (Kadlec and Knight, 1996). Despite 
the varying wastewater constituents and lo cal environments within which they must 
be treated, the USEPA (2000) and Canadian  Ministry of Environment (2007) have 
specified a hydraulic residence of time of 5-6 days for free water surface (FWS) 
constructed wetlands treating municipal wa stewater. The NRCS (1991) has suggested 
12 days for the treatment of agricultural wastewater. These guidelines however have 
been developed based on effluent targ et rates for biological oxygen demand (BOD 5) 
and total suspended solids (TSS), and are ge ared towards defined point source waste 
streams. There are no specifications to da te on the necessary hydraulic retention time 
for constructed wetlands treating diffuse agricultural wastewater. 
 
2.6.3.  Effect of Soil Type in a Constructed Wetland 
The substrate used to construct a treatment wetland is extremely important as it is 
the foundation for all the abiotic and biotic  components present within the system 
(Kadlec and Knight, 1996). The physical and ch emical structure of the soil influences 
the internal chemical and biological proce sses common in wetlands. The ability of the 
soil to function as a sink for contaminants  varies depending on the physico-chemical 
conditions within the system (Novak  et al. , 2004).  
Phosphorus adsorption capacity of soils is often of interest in the design of CWs 
due to its potential role as a P sink. The P- binding capacity of a soil usually increases 
with clay and mineral content; more speci fically Fe, Al and Ca and its quantity of 
exchangeable cations (Vymazal, 2007). However, parameters such as pH, dissolved  20oxygen and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) will largely influence the P-
exchange processes between the soil and water interface (Lijklema, 1980).  
Under oxidized conditions, adsorption a nd precipitation reac tions between soil 
cations and dissolved P are favored and ar e the dominant P retention mechanisms. 
Ca-P compounds are favoured under alka line conditions and Al-P and Fe-P 
compound formation is dominant  in acidic conditions (Novak  et al. , 2004). P research 
into adsorption curves of various soil type s has demonstrated that soils eventually 
reach a saturation point. Exceeding a wetland’ s P adsorption capacity can result in P 
release to the receiving wa ter bodies. A larger cation ex change capacity  of the soil 
prolongs the time until satura tion is reached. (Del Bubba  et al. , 2003) suggest that the 
best way to sustain a soil’s  long term P removal is to amend it with a high-binding 
mineral such as calcium to promote precipitation which produces insoluble 
phosphates.  
Studies in the Netherlands and New Zealand have also explored the addition of Fe 
to riparian soils to precipitate out soluble P in order to prevent it from being leached 
in the runoff (Kronvang  et al. , 2005; Aye  et al. , 2006). The authors of both studies 
explain that due to the lim ited capacity of soils to bind P, amendments are necessary 
to prevent P loss once they are saturate d. They also express concern about the 
possible negative environmental impacts of in troducing metals such as Fe and suggest 
further impact studies on grazing animal s, crops and receiving waterways.  
Under low oxygen conditions, when ORP is low and the system is considered 
anaerobic, the soil properties conducive to  P binding become severely hindered. In 
contrast, N removal is favored under anaerobic conditions due to the activation of denitrifiying bacteria (Watts and Seit zinger, 2000). In flooded soils, dissolved 
inorganic phosphorus solubility is related to  the oxidative status of iron (Fe) (Szogi  et 
al., 2004b). When Ferric-iron (Fe
3+) is reduced to soluble Ferrous-iron (Fe2+), it 
releases any bound anion, in cluding phosphate (Vohla  et al. , 2006). This decreases 
the soil’s capacity to store P, or potentially acting as a source of P even if the soil is 
not saturated. The reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ is a significant loss of P binding capacity 
because Fe is one of the most abundant me tals in soils (Miller and Gardiner, 1998). 
Vohla et al.,  (2006) found a significant negati ve correlation between oxidation- 21reduction potential (ORP) and outlet dissolved P and Fe 2+ concentration in their 
sandy soil constructed wetland. They have suggested aeration would increase the 
ORP in order for Fe3+ to remain in the soil column and bind incoming dissolved P.  
 
2.6.4.  Constructed Wetland Vegetation 
The role of vegetation in constructed we tlands has been much discussed in the 
literature in recent years. In general,  studies comparing non-vegetated versus 
vegetated wetland microcosms have reported better nutrient removal in the vegetated 
treatment (Tanner, 1996; Yang  et al. , 2001; Hench  et al. , 2003; Huett  et al. , 2005; 
Lee and Scholz, 2007). Macrophytes, or emergent vegetation, are integral 
components in both surface and subsurface flow constructed wetlands. There appears 
to be unanimous agreement in the literature  that their primary function is not direct 
nutrient uptake, but more importantly to create and support habitat for microbial 
populations responsible for N removal by ni trification and den itrification, through 
oxygen transport to the root zone and carbon generation.  
Macrophytes perhaps further enhance deni trification through plant transpiration 
whereby NO 3 is pulled into anaerobic sites via the resulting mass flux (Martin  et al. , 
2003).  Macrophytes also impact the hydrau lic regime of the wetland by acting as 
physical structures to redu ce the turbulence and velocity  of incoming water (Brix, 
1997; Jenkins and Greenway, 2005). Another important removal mechanism is 
nutrient sequestration through organic ma tter accretion (Reddy and Patrick, 1984; 
Kadlec and Knight, 1996; Tanner, 1996; Sartoris  et al. , 2000; Thullen  et al. , 2005). 
Under anaerobic conditions, decomposition a nd mineralization of plant litter is 
attenuated (Healy and Cawley, 2002) thus sequestering nutrients. Plant nutrient 
sequestration is a complex process because there are several factors which influence 
the process and must therefore be consider ed: (1) the age and ge ographical location of 
the constructed wetland, (2) the species, (3) the soil type, and (4) the nutrient loading 
rate. 
    222.6.4.1.   Constructed Wetland Maturation and Climate 
The age of the constructed wetland is a key consideration because nutrient 
sequestration is more importantly relative to biomass production than it is to biomass 
concentration (Silvan  et al. , 2004). Thullen et al (2005) also  point out that the effect 
of newly planted species is higher nutrien t uptake than would be expected from 
mature plants (Thullen  et al. , 2005).  
Rapidly colonizing emergent vegetation in a newly constructed wetland will 
contribute a greater relative nutrient upta ke compared to a constructed wetland 
already colonized with mature vegetation. Ve getation productivity also increases with 
mean annual temperature and therefore gr eater nutrient rete ntion rates can be 
expected in warmer climatic regions (Toet  et al. , 2005). 
Some examples of nutrient uptake by pl ants in warmer climates come from 
Kadlec and Knight’s (1996) text book ‘Treat ment Wetlands’, a stap le for constructed 
wetland designers. The book gives primary production estimates for cattail nutrient 
uptake of 60-260 g N m-2 year-1 and 7.5-40 g P m-2 year-1, based on studies conducted 
in Florida. A study out of North Carolina evaluated two constr ucted wetland cells 
receiving agricultural wastewater which cont ained three species of rushes, cattails and 
bur reed. They observed an annual N storage in plant biomass of 38.7 g m-2  and 43.7 
g m-2 per year respectively (Szogi  et al. , 2003). Another study of common reed 
nutrient retention in a New South Wale s, Australia wetland found an average 
retention of 67.23 g N m-2 (Hocking, 1989). 
In comparison, values reported out of more  northern climates are much lower and 
are often reported per growing season, ra ther than per year, due to the defined 
seasonally driven cycles of growing a nd dying. Several studies on northern climate 
CWs have reported nutrient removal via biomass incorporation of between 1.5 and 
9% for both N and P in mature (>5 year) constructed wetlands (Edwards  et al. , 2006; 
Gottschall  et al. , 2007; Kroger  et al. , 2007). A study in the Czech Republic on a 5 
year old constructed wetland planted with reed canary gr ass, observed removal rates 
of 11.3 g N m-2 and 1.2 g P m-2 corresponding to 9.2% and 3.1% of the incoming N 
and P respectively (Edwards  et al. , 2006). A cattail dominated constructed wetland 
built in 1995 in Ontario, Canada, reported in 2007 plant retention of approximately  237.9 g N m-2 in one of the vegetated cell compone nts of the system, accounting for 9% 
of the total N removal (Gottschall  et al. , 2007). A New York study on the N and P 
retention of five wetland sp ecies growing in an agricultural wetland buffer found reed 
canary grass and soft rush have  N retention rates of 10.7 g N m-2 and 11.8 g N m-2 
respectively, and P retention of 1.9 g P m-2 and 1.3 g P m-2 respectively(Kao  et al. , 
2003). A Finnish study on a reclaimed wetla nd buffer reported retention rates by E. 
vaginatum  biomass of 12.67 g m-1 N and 1.31 g m-1 P, after introducing excess NO 3 
and PO 4 for 150 days (Silvan  et al. , 2004).  
It is evident that retention rates betw een species and geographic regions differ, 
therefore it is important for the designer of  a constructed wetland to make decisions 
on vegetation based on studies pertaining to th eir climate and available species. It is 
also important to understand that mature  vegetation that is no longer rapidly 
colonizing a wetland will ultimately take up less nutrients than a newly planted one. 
An immature wetland, however, needs time to grow in order to have a positive effect 
on retention time, and build up an orga nic carbon substratum for promoting 
denitrification (Raisi n and Mitchell, 1995). 
 
2.6.4.2.   Plant Species in a Constructed Wetland 
 Common species used in colder  climates include cattails ( Typha latifolia  L. and 
Typha angustifolia L.), reed canary grass ( Phalaris arundinaceae L.), common reed 
(Phragmites australis L.), club-rush ( Schoenoplectus lacustris L.) and soft-rush 
(Juncus effuses L.) (Kadlec and Knight, 1996; Kao  et al. , 2003; Maddison  et al. , 
2005). Some researchers argue that nutrie nt uptake by wetland vegetation is not 
considered a permanent removal mechanism because upon senescence, nutrients are 
released back into the water. Nevertheless, plant communities have been shown to be integral components for nutrient storage in  agricultural constructed wetlands (Kroger  
et al. , 2007) due to their ability to sequester nutrients duri ng the growing season when 
receiving water bodies are most susceptible to eutrophication (Kao  et al. , 2003; 
Gottschall  et al. , 2007).  
The rate of nutrient uptake as well as the rate of decomposition between wetland 
species has been shown to differ (Kao  et al. , 2003). Emergent vegetation creates a  24large fraction of the organic matter produced  in wetlands (Alvar ez and Becares, 2006) 
where nutrients can be sequestered (Kadl ec and Knight, 1996). Thus, in addition to 
uptake rates, decomposition rates are impor tant to consider when designing a 
wetland.  
 
2.6.4.3.   Plant Decomposition Rate in a Constructed Wetland 
Alvarez and Becares (2006) divide m acrophyte decomposition into three phases: 
(1) a period of swift in itial loss as a result of leaching, (2) a longer period of microbial 
decomposition and colonization (3) and finally  mechanical and invertebrate mediated 
disintegration. The phase lengt h is dependent on environmen tal factors as well as the 
detrital quality as a carbon source (Hume  et al. , 2002; Edwards  et al. , 2006).  
Alvarez and Becares’ (2006) comparative study on cattail decay rates with other 
common wetland vegetation, found that cattails are one of the physically toughest and 
most resistant macrophytes to decomposition. They conclude that the detritus will 
remain longer in the system and could destru ctively block the subs trate or deepen the 
sediment layer. In contrast, not all re searchers consider slow decomposition a 
negative trait. In newly built constructe d wetlands carbon can be rate-limiting to 
denitrifying bacteria. Slowly decomposi ng species provide a carbon source for 
microbes the following spring, before species  with more rapid life cycles begin 
growing.  
Gottschall et al.,  (2007) surmise that cattail root s and rhizomes, which store a 
large component of nutrients during the non- growing season and have a turnover rate 
of up to 2 years, play an important role  in diverting nutrien t loads to vulnerable 
watersheds during the growing season. Kao et al.,  (2003) studied the N and P 
accumulation in 5 wetland species and subs equently measured their respective 
decomposition rates in terms of percentage  N and P retained. Soft rush had the 
highest accumulation of nutrients duri ng the growing season and the highest 
percentage remaining in the litter the following spring. While reed canary grass had 
an uptake rate similar to the soft rush, it had the lowest percentage of remaining 
nutrients the following spring.   25The researchers also looked at the percen tage nutrients remaining after 150 days 
of decomposition to demonstr ate the benefits of vegeta tion retention at prolonging 
nutrient release until the growing season is over and receiving water bodies are less 
susceptible to eutrophication. In fact, afte r 150 days, soft rush still contained 9.3 g N 
m-2 and 1.3 g P m-2 while reed canary gra ss only contained 3.3 g N m-2 and 0.2 g P m-
2. This study highlights the variability betw een species in their ability to retain 
nutrients and lends to the argument of harvesting vegetation for permanent nutrient 
removal. Kroger  et al. , (2007) studied decomposition rates of plants exposed to 
agricultural runoff and suggest ed that at the onset of senescence, the subsequent 
nutrient translocation from shoots to root s, and the resulting above ground nutrient 
reduction, may buffer the effects of leachi ng in the initial phase of decomposition. 
Their study also showed that retention rates during senes cence were lower for P than 
for N (Kroger  et al. , 2007).  
 
2.6.4.4.  Harvesting Plants in a Constructed Wetland 
Harvesting of wetland vegetation as a pe rmanent nutrient removal mechanism is 
perhaps one of the most controversial issues  in the literature. Some researchers claim 
that biomass removal is ineffective when less than 10% of the nutrients are stored, 
even in low-loaded systems (Kadl ec, 2005; Vymazal, 2007), while others  
recommend harvesting from wetlands treati ng diluted wastewater to avoid over-
accumulation of organic matter (Alvarez and Be cares, 2006). In order to benefit from 
biomass harvesting in terms of nutrient re moval, it is imperative to understand the 
nature of the species’ growth and storage pa tterns in order to determine which are the 
best ones for harvesting and at what  time of year (Tanner, 1996; Ying  et al. , 2007).  
A study on the effects cattail transpiration and harvesting on nitrate concentration 
in microcosms suggested that harvesting ca ttail biomass resulted in increased growth 
as compared to the unharvested treatment, wh ile transpiration rates were lowest in the 
harvested treatments (Martin  et al. , 2003). The results of the study suggest that 
transpiration rates contributed more to nitr ate reductions than did plant uptake due to 
increased growth. They also found that th e overall primary removal mechanism for N 
was denitrification. While it ap pears that plants with grea ter transpiration rates may  26be more suitable for treating nitrate, the authors acknowledge that  the amount of the 
biomass harvested, and at the time of year wh en the greatest amount of nutrients is in 
the above ground shoots, warrants further investigation. A potential advantage to 
harvesting would be that the plants are kept in immature phases of growth when 
productivity is higher (Martin  et al. , 2003; Edwards  et al. , 2006; Vymazal, 2007). 
Harvesting of biomass for permanent nutri ent removal is a potential constructed 
wetland management strategy but it is neces sary to consider species and biomass 
partitioning between roots and shoots in order to determine which time of year would 
yield optimal results (Toet  et al. , 2005). It is also importa nt to consider the carbon 
status of the system as well as the am ount harvested in order to still promote 
transpiration for nitrate movement towa rds the root zone via mass flux (Martin  et al. , 
2003). 
 
2.6.4.5.   Constructed Wetland Substrate 
The soil substrate greatly influences ve getation growth, and in turn how the 
vegetation will indirectly suppor t further nutrient removal. The soil substrate itself is 
a source of nutrients for plants; depending on the wastewater supplied to the wetland, 
it is possible for one or more necessary nutrients to be lacking. This often occurs with 
micronutrients and therefore it is up to the soil substrate to provide them. Vegetation 
type positively affects overall N and P removal not only through uptake, but also 
through the quality of availa ble carbon incorporated in to the soil substrate for 
nitrification and de nitrification (Hume  et al. , 2002). Vegetation type also influences 
pH and oxidation status within the system, which impacts adsorption and 
precipitation of P by the soil (Akratos and Tsihrintzis, 2007). These processes are 
dependent on the soil substrate and how well the plants are able to grow and establish 
rooting. The treatment factors of substrate,  vegetation and growth  period, individually 
and in combination, all significantly  affect nutrient removal (Yang  et al. , 2001).  
A comparison of N and P removal by cons tructed wetland microcosms filled with 
a gravel substrate and a mineral soil subs trate, with a vegetated and unvegetated 
treatment of each, found that the unvegetated soil substrate removed the most soluble 
reactive phosphorus (SRP) due to precipitati on reactions between the Ca and Al. The  27authors postulated that the eff ect of plant litter in the vegetated soil treatment released 
some of the SRP back into the water. They go on to recommend however, that plant 
assimilation may become the primary rem oval mechanism once the soil has reached 
saturation and harvesting may be helpful once this occurs. In contrast, inorganic 
nitrogen was removed more efficiently in the vegetated soil treatment, most likely due to the presence of de nitrifying bacteria (Yang  et al. , 2001). 
 
2.6.5.  Microbial Actions in a Constructed Wetland 
Microbial actions within a constructed wetland are arguably the most important 
component for nitrogen treatment. Denitrific ation is considered the main permanent 
removal mechanism for N in wetlands (Bach and and Horne, 2000) and there does not 
appear to be any statements in the literature  to the contrary. An interesting addition to 
the N cycle has been identified in the la st decade by a group in the Netherlands. The 
discovery is termed ANNAMOX,. a pathway whereby bacteria capable of anaerobic, 
autotrophic oxidation of ammonium, using nitrite as an electron acceptor, form 
gaseous molecular nitrogen (Anyus heva and Kalyuzhnyi, 2007). ANNAMOX 
research thus far has indicated these or ganisms are particularly important for N 
processing in the ocean (Francis  et al. , 2007) and their role in constructed wetlands 
treating agricultural wastewater is emerging. 
Denitrification is an important component  of the nitrogen cy cle that returns N 
present in plants, soil and water back to the atmosphere (Firth and Edwards, 2000; 
Watts and Seitzinger, 2000). Research is generally focused on promoting 
denitrification and decreasing the N
2O:N 2 ratio of gases produced, in order to reduce 
greenhouse gases (Freeman  et al. , 1997; Chang  et al. , 1998; Chen  et al. , 1999). 
Nitrous oxide and nitric oxide are intermedia ry products of the denitrification reaction 
pathway and have been linked to global wa rming and ozone layer damage (Firth and 
Edwards, 2000). 
Denitrification is the biologi cal reduction of nitrite (NO 2) and nitrate (NO 3) to N 2 
gas. The conditions of the bacterial cultures influence the rate at which denitrification 
occurs and the resulting N 2O:N 2 ratio (Thomas  et al. , 1994). Factors affecting the  28responsible bacteria include O 2, NO 2+NO 3 concentration, pH a nd availability of 
carbon (Smith and Tiedje, 1979).  
The effect of O 2 is not the same on every specie s of denitrifying bacteria. Some 
can carry out denitrificat ion in the presence of O 2 while others cannot; in the presence 
of oxygen it is called aerobic de nitrification as opposed to  anaerobic denitrification. 
Oxygen controls denitrification through ge ne expression and inhibition of enzymes 
responsible for it (Thomas  et al. , 1994). Generally, if the oxy gen status in a wetland is 
low, with corresponding reduced oxidation-reduction potential, NO 3 is the main 
electron acceptor for cellular  respiration thus promoti ng denitrification (Reddy and 
Patrick, 1984).  
In constructed wetlands, the availability of carbon has been shown to directly 
impact the ratio of N 2O:N 2 produced, higher available C has been correlated with 
more complete denitrification (Hunt  et al. , 2003). In other words, available C:N 
affects denitrification and  4:1 is cons idered optimum (Caskey and Tiedje, 1979; 
Thomas  et al. , 1994).  
A study on the denitrification enzyme act ivity (DEA) on the litter of three 
different wetland plant species showed a mark ed difference, suggesting differences in 
the quality of organic material between plants for supporting de nitrifying bacteria. 
The authors concluded that because the yiel d of plant detritus varies significantly 
between species, the seasonal variation in de nitrification capacity is likely to vary 
between species (Bastviken  et al. , 2005). This supports the contention that species 
diversity within wetlands may have a pos itive effect on supporting denitrification 
functions (Gilbert, 2004). 
 
2.7. Comparison of Constructed Wetlands Treating Agricultural NPS 
 Using constructed wetlands as a best  management practi ce for mitigating NPS 
agricultural pollution in colder climates has been gaining attenti on in recent years. 
Many of the design parameters have been  adopted from CWs treating point source 
waste streams such as from dairy and sw ine barns. Table 2.1 summarizes removal 
rates and efficiencies from several CWs from different geographic regions treating 
agriculturally generated NPS .   29Table 2.1 . Total N and P annual removal by several cons tructed wetlands receiving  agricultural runoff.

 Comparing constructed treatment we tlands can be difficult and at times 
misleading. They are custom built to deal with  specific target wast ewater at specific 
locations and differ not only in physical shape and dimension, but in vegetation 
cover, hydraulic retention time and pollutant loading rates. For ex ample, constructed 
wetlands receiving secondary municipal wast e effluent at regula ted flow rates are 
much easier to measure and assess than  CWs receiving agricultural runoff.  
 Agricultural runoff characteristics vary ba sed on rainfall and irrigation events and 
therefore vary month to month, year to year  and watershed to watershed. Hence, it is 
important to consider removal efficiencies  along with total loads when comparing 
wetlands because small loads may enter and be removed by wetlands at certain times 
of the year resulting in high removal efficien cies but contributing ve ry little to overall 
nutrient removal (Kovacic  et al. , 2000).  
Treatment efficiencies vary considerably  as seen in Table 1. For CWs treating 
agricultural runoff, it has been  suggested that reasonable l ong-term retention rates for 
P be 1-5 g P m-2 per year, based on studies performed in northeastern Illinois (Mitsch  
et al. , 1995). Others broaden the range to 0.5-10 g P m-2 per year (Kadlec and Knight,  301996). As of yet there are no guidelines fo r acceptable N remova l rates from NPS 
pollution. The CWs shown in Table 1 all dem onstrate higher removal efficiencies for 
P than N however this trend is highly de pendent on the conditions  within the wetland 
system.  
Fink and Mitsch (2004) explain that b ecause the mechanisms by which P and N 
are retained within the wetland differ, the wetland design should depend on which 
nutrient is more important to attenuate. P re moval via chemical react ions with the soil 
favor oxygenated conditions, while N rem oval via denitrification favors anaerobic 
conditions. When the retention of both N a nd P are equally important then the design 
must take this into account based on what species of N and P is in the influent.  
Braskerud (2002b) suggests that P retent ion was successful in their small CWs 
because 51-88% of the incoming P was in pa rticulate form. This meant that physical 
particle settling was the primary P remova l mechanism as 45% of the particulate P 
was retained while only 5% of  the dissolved P was retained. Had a larger fraction of 
the P been in dissolved form, it is likely th at the overall P retention would not have 
been so high.  
Healy and Cawley (2002) point out that  when a wetland is well suited for N 
retention, it is of little us e for P reduction. While CWs have been proven useful 
treating point source waste streams from agricultural as well as municipal and 
industrial sources, thei r applicability for tr eating NPS in colder climates has been 
questioned (Newman  et al. , 2000). Research is however proving their usefulness as a 
BMP,  as demonstrated by the Norwegia n government’s commitment to contributing 
70% of the cost of building a wetland to  farmers to mitigate P pollution (Braskerud, 
2002b). 
 So far, it appears that  constructed wetlands aime d at treating NPS pollution, 
particularly for N and P retention, are reta ining one more successfully than the other 
due to the lack of ideal c onditions for both. As research continues into improving CW 
systems for nutrient mitigation from agricultural NPS, we can expect to see designs 
including wetland cells connected in seri es to attempt to provide conditions 
conducive to both N and P removal.   312.8. Summary 
As the pressure on the world water suppl y increases with increasing demand for 
food production, so does the issue of water quality deterioration. In Quebec, Canada, 
agricultural intens ification has lead to increasi ng amounts of agri cultural non point 
source pollution in the form  of nutrient laden runoff.  Nitrogen and phosphorus 
coming from agricultural land is of particul ar concern because of its negative effects 
on receiving freshwater bodies. Eutrophication of freshwater is of particular concern 
because it renders the the water body usel ess for drinking, swimming or fishing.  
Best management practices for the mitig ation of agricultural runoff are being 
implemented, and constructed wetlands ar e gaining attention as a BMP. While 
constructed wetlands have been proven to  successfully treat point source waste 
streams, they are emerging as a low-cost tool for treating nonpoi nt source waste. 
Previously, the role of co nstructed wetlands in treating NPS pollution in colder 
climates was questioned; however, studies out of the northern US and Scandinavia 
are demonstrating that they are a viable  option. Because the success of a wetland 
system is based on adapting the design to the climatic conditions, research into 
understanding CW removal mechanisms for N and P, and the factors which influence 
those mechanisms, is currently taking pl ace in an effort to optimize their design.

Agricultural runoff containing phosphorus is  a threat to fres hwater quality in 
Quebec. Constructed wetland design must be  adapted to the local environment and 
the contents of the agricultural runoff. Th e following chapter addr esses the role of 
substrate in a constructed wetland built to tr eat agricultural runoff containing levels of 
P typical in Quebec. The two soil substrat es tested are common in Quebec and the 
study addresses how the P re tention within the wetland was impacted by them. We 
were interested in discerning if one soil s ubstrate would remove more than the other, 
and why this occurred.

3.1. Abstract 
Excess P in surface waters in Quebec is the primary cause of water quality 
deterioration and the majority of it is co ming from agricultural land.  This study was 
aimed at studying two substrates, a sandy clay  loam and a sand soil, used in a surface-
flow constructed wetland (CW) to compare how they influenced P retention within 
the CW. A secondary aim was to determine the hydraulic residence time of the 
wetland tanks and to measure any difference in times between soil types. Field measurements were taken at the pilot-s cale surface-flow cons tructed wetland site 
between July 5 and October 1, 2007. It  consisted of three replicate tanks
 containing 
the sandy clay loam and three containing the sand soil. The surface area of each tank 
was 9.29 m2 and was cylindrical in shape with a radius of 0.75 m. The inlet end was 
characterized by a deep zone which sl oped upwards to a shallow zone which 
occupied 66% of the surface area and wa s planted with reed canary grass ( Phalaris 
arundinacea L.) and cattails ( Typha latifolia L.). The tanks were flooded 
continuously for the duration of the study w ith artificial agricu ltural runoff solution 
containing 0.3 mg L-1 dissolved reactive P and 10 mg L-1 nitrate-N. The six treatment 
tanks received 19.6 to 33.4 g of P over the st udy period and the rate of retention was 
0.9 to 1.6 g m2. This corresponded to an average removal efficiency of 41%; there 
was no significant difference in the P reten tion by the tanks containing the different 
soil types. The sandy clay loam tanks were  more reduced and had greater vegetation 
growth than the sand tanks. This likely led to the reduction of Fe3+ in the sandy clay 
loam soil and subsequent release of  bound P which was then taken up by the 
colonizing vegetation. The higher nutrients inherent in the sandy clay loam as 
compared to the sand would have suppor ted the greater vegetation growth thus 
allowing for a greater vegetation uptake of P. The net overall results show no 
difference in P retention between the two so il types. A conservative tracer test using  41bromide revealed a mean hydraulic retention time of approximately 2.2 days for all 
tanks; however, the active volume of the sand tanks was greater. This investigation 
suggests that a sandy soil may be less prone  to reducing conditions in a surface-flow 
CW and therefore maintain its role as a sink for P adsorption and precipitation for 
longer than the sandy clay loam. Further st udies should investigate passive aeration 
and increasing the hydraulic retention time to increas e the retention of P. 
 
3.2. Introduction and Background 
Nutrient overloading of freshwater bodies  in North America has had a significant 
impact on their degradation. Diffuse, or non-point source (NPS) pollution has been 
deemed the primary source of these exce ss nutrients, more specifically phosphorus 
and nitrogen, and agriculture is the number  one contributor to NPS pollution (Kellogg 
and Maizel, 1994). As large-scale farmi ng operations continue to intensify 
production, soil P levels are increasing beyond their absorption capacity and the 
excess is being lost in surface runoff and subsurface drainage water. Phosphorus is 
targeted for reduction because it is often ra te limiting to the growth of freshwater 
algae (Braskerud, 2002b). The high soil P is the result of both manure spreading and 
mineral P fertilizer application; in the cas e of livestock operati ons, they often produce 
more manure than there is land available fo r spreading, leading to  over application. In 
the case of crop producers, over-application of mineral fertilizer is common as 
maximum crop yield is the goal (Berka  et al. , 2001).  
Generally, constructed wetlands (CWs) tr eating direct on-farm waste such as 
manure pile runoff or milk house wash for example, are dealing with much more 
concentrated waste streams. In contrast, ag ricultural runoff is characterized by large 
volumes of water with lower concentrations coming from agricultural land, either 
from the surface or subsurface drains. In Qu ebec, the increasing number of blue-green 
algae outbreaks in lakes and streams has been  attributed to excess P in the watersheds 
with upwards of 70% estimated to be comi ng from agricultural non-point sources. In 
most natural ecological systems, phosphor us is the growth-limiting nutrient as 
nitrogen is naturally more abundant. The Qu ebec Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries 
and Food, Quebec Farmers Association and Lake Champlain Coalition, a joint  42committee between the province of Quebec and states of Vermont and New York, are 
developing measures to control and monito r the amount of P entering the watersheds. 
Controlling the source of the nutrients is the most  cost-effective long term 
management option (Berka  et al. , 2001) and therefore best management practices at 
the farm scale to reduce and ideally preven t nutrient loss from the farm are being 
studied and implemented (Ha mmer, 1992). Constructed wetlands are an interesting 
best management tool as the concept can be  implemented in almost any situation and 
built with locally available materi als (Casey and Klaine, 2001; Aye  et al. , 2006). For 
example a constructed wetland built on munici pal land at the conj unction of drainage 
ditches from several farms could be implem ented with the goal being to trap the 
runoff water and reduce the nutrient load before  it reaches the tributaries. In designing 
a best management tool, it is important to understand not only the nutrient removal 
mechanisms which occur naturally in a wetland, but how these mechanisms are 
affected by the available structural compone nts and the local environment. This study 
explored how P removal was impacted by two di fferent soil substrates  in order to help 
optimize the design of the constructed wetland within the local framework of the target runoff.  
The goal of this research was to test if the soil substrate had an impact on a 
surface flow constructed wetland’s ability  to reduce dissolved phosphorus from 
agricultural runoff. This was achieved by studying six open ditch-style tanks at a 
pilot-scale constructed wetland site. It wa s expected that the soil substrate would 
impact the amount of dissolved phosphor us removed through differing adsorption 
capacities and differing plant yields. The more  specific aim was to determine if there 
was a difference between two soil types co mmon to Southern Quebec; a sandy clay 
loam field soil and a sandy so il, in their ability  to reduce dissolved phosphorous from 
a simulated agricultural r unoff solution. The simulated agricultural runoff solution 
contained 0.3 mg P L
-1 as orthophosphate and 10 mg N L-1 as nitrate. The results of 
the nitrate removal by both soil types are pr esented in Chapter 4. The P concentration 
of 0.3 mg L-1 was chosen because it is 10 times gr eater than the threshold level of 
0.03 mg TP L-1 permitted to enter surface waters as determined by the Quebec 
Ministry of Environment (2001). Levels found in non point source agricultural runoff  43in Southern Quebec have been found above 0.3 mg L-1 (Eastman, 2008). A secondary 
goal was to determine experimentally what  the mean hydraulic re tention time was for 
the constructed wetland treatment mesocosm s with the different soil types and how 
this impacted P removal efficiencies. It  was expected that the field soil would 
outperform the sandy soil in P removal for th ree reasons; it would 1)  allow for greater 
P binding directly to th e soil particles because of a larger pool of Al3+ and Fe3+, 2) it 
would have a longer hydraulic residence tim e due to the higher clay content and 3) 
due to its higher nutrient cont ent, it would promote and su stain and larger vegetation 
cover thus increasing the amount of P uptake by plants. In order to compare these two 
soil types, we monitored water-dissolved P- concentrations at the inflow and outflow 
as well as dissolved oxygen, oxidation-reductio n potential, pH and temperature inside 
the mesocosms. Soil P levels and vegetation density were also determined.  
 
3.3. Methodology  
3.3.1.  Site description 
Field measurements were made at a pilo t-scale constructed wetland research site 
located 3km north of McGill University ’s Macdonald Campus in Ste-Anne-de-
Bellevue, Quebec, Canada. The site becam e operational in the summer of 2006. It 
consisted of six mesocosms which we re above-ground, black, open high density 
polyethylene (HDPE) half-cylinder shaped tanks; three of the six open ditch-style 
tanks were filled with a sa ndy soil and the other three wi th a sandy clay loam field 
soil. Each tank measured 6.1 m in lengt h, 1.5 m in diameter and 0.75 m radius and 
had a surface area of 9.29 m2. The volume was approximately 4.17m3 with 65% 
occupied by soil. Table 3.1 summarizes some  of the soil properties of the two soil 
types.

       aSize group of soil particles: Sand 2mm-53µm, Silt 53-2µm, Clay < 2µm  44At the inlet end of the tanks there was a deep zone from which the soil sloped 
upwards to the shallow zone. The shallow zone occupied approximately 66% of the 
surface area and was vegetate d with alternating secti ons of reed canary grass 
(Phalaris arundinaceae L.) and cattails ( Typha latifolia L.); there were three bands of 
reed canary grass at the front, middle a nd end of the shallow zone which were 
separated by patches of ca ttails. The water flowed from the deep zone, through the 
shallow vegetated section to the outlet (F igure 3.1). The inlet manifold was a 1-m 
piece of perforated 10.16-cm sewer pipe that formed a T with the inlet pipe. The 
outlet manifold was similar to the inlet and funneled the water out through a 2.54-cm 
diameter section of Taigon ® tubing into a tipping bucket. The tipping bucket was 
connected to a datalogger recording th e volume of flow exiting each tank. The 
incorporation of a deep zone was importan t to reduce incoming flow rates and aid the 
distribution of the water in order to alleviate short-ci rcuiting and maximize hydraulic 
residence time (Simi and Mitchell, 1999) The inlet T-shaped manifold was installed 
to further distribute the incoming water a nd improve the hydraulic retention time. It 
was demonstrated through the results of tracer test on a gr avel bed wetland with and 
without a distribution manifold, that the hydraulic residence was increased with a 
distribution manifold (S hilton and Prasad, 1996). 
There were three mixing tanks located above the distribution tanks where the 
artificial runoff solution was mixed. The ta rget concentration of the runoff solution 
was 10 mg L-1 nitrate-N and 0.3 mg L-1 dissolved reactive phosphorous as 
orthophosphate. This solution was gravity fe d via 5.08-cm drainage pipe to the two 
distribution tanks which we re connected to each other by two 10.16-cm drainage 
pipes. The distribution tanks were connect ed to the vegetated treatment tanks via 
10.16-cm white PVC sewer pipe. The target in flow rate to each treatment tank was 1L 
min-1 because it was estimated that this  would result in a minimum hydraulic 
retention time of 1 day, based on theoretical calculat ions of the empty tanks.  45

3.3.2.  Sample collection and analysis for P 
The study began July 5, 2007 by running municipal water through the treatment 
tanks. Water samples and water column info rmation such as dissolved oxygen (DO), 
oxidation-reduction potential (O RP), temperature and pH was collected to determine 
initial conditions. Starting July 10, 2007 the municipal water supply was stopped and 
the system started receiving the artificial runoff solution continuously until October 1, 
2007. Outlet water samples from each wetland treatment tank were collected by a  46custom-built Avensys autosampler every 42 hours in 1-L Nalgene HDPE bottles. 
Upon collection, a composite of the four samples collected every 42 hours from the 
same tank was mixed by adding 30 mL of each into the sample bottle. Therefore, a more representative sample was obtained because it was composed of a mixture of the four individual samples collected during that week. Grab samples from the mixing 
and distribution tanks were collected as we ll. Water samples were collected weekly 
and immediately filtered through 0.45-mi cron nylon membranes into acid-washed 
120-mL Nalgene HDPE bottles. Non-filtered samples were also collected in acid-
washed bottles and then transported in an ice- filled cooler back to the laboratory 4º C 
fridge for analysis. Dissolved oxygen (DO) , pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) 
and temperature data was also collected week ly in the deep zone and shallow zone of 
vegetated tanks, as well as from the su rface water of the distribution and mixing 
tanks. These data were collected using a Ho riba portable pH meter (Model Series D-
52, Horiba International Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) with corresponding DO probe, 
ORP probe, and a pH/temperature probe. A ll probes were calibrated and stored 
according to Horiba’s specifications (H oriba D series operation manual, 2001). 
Filtered water samples were analyzed for dissolved reactive phosphorous 
(DRP) as ortho -phosphate and total dissolved phosphorous (TDP), and unfiltered 
water samples were analyzed for total phos phorous (TP). All analyses were carried 
out on a Lachat  Flow Injection Analys is System (Model QuikChem® 8500, Lachat 
Instruments, Loveland, Colorado) with de tection range of 0.01 to 2.00 mg P/L. To 
measure TDP and TP, 5-mL aliquots of the filtered and unfiltered samples were 
digested with a peroxodisulfate oxidation method (Ebina  et al. , 1983) and then 
analyzed for ortho -phosphate using the Lachat autoan alyzer. It was found that there 
was no particulate P entering or exiting the we tland tanks due to th e lack of difference 
between TDP and TP so only TDP results ar e reported in this paper. Dissolved 
organic P was calculated as the differen ce between total dissolved P and ortho-
phosphate (Kovacic  et al. , 2000), referred to as dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP). 
Soil samples were collected in November 2006 and November 2007. In 
November 2006, nine samples were collected from each tank at the front, middle and 
back of the shallow zone at depths 0-10.16 cm, 20-30 cm and 50 cm. In November  472007, five samples were collected from each ta nk, three from the three depths in the 
middle section and 0-10.16 cm from the fr ont and back section. Samples were air 
dried at room temperature a nd then Mehlich III extracti on was performed to quantify 
extractable P, aluminum and iron. P wa s analyzed on a Lachat flow-injection 
autoanalyzer, and Al and Fe were analy zed on an ICP flame. Organic matter was 
determined by ‘loss on ignition’. 
 
3.3.3.  Tracer study  
A bromide tracer study was conducted on the six vegetated tanks to determine the 
mean retention time of each. Bromide was c hosen because of its inert properties and 
high recovery rate, as demonstrated in other wetland tracer studies (Smith  et al. , 
2005b; Tanner  et al. , 1998), and loss due to uptake by vegetation was not a threat as 
the growing season was over. The study wa s conducted from October 15 to October 
22, 2008. The mass of bromide added was 1000 times the detection limit of 0.1 mg L-
1, multiplied by the tank volume, and was ther efore 417 g for the vegetated tanks. The 
bromide (as ACG grade potassium bromide) wa s dissolved in four litres of distilled 
water and was added to the inflow of each  tank at 9am on October 15. Outflow water 
samples were collected every 3 hours from the tanks until 9am on October 22. 
Outflow flow data was collected continuous ly by dataloggers connected to tipping 
buckets. An error occurred with the datalogg ers and flow data was lost for the first 
three days of the tracer test. Flow data was obtained for the period of October 18 to 
22, 2007 and interpolated back to estimate flows for the 15th, 16th and 17th. Samples 
were analyzed in the lab for bromide c oncentration using the Standard Methods 
Bromide Colorimetric Method (APHA  et al. , 1992). 
 
3.3.4.  Statistical analyses 
A statistical model using repeated measur es over time was employed to determine 
if the outlet concentration for DRP and TDP was different between the two soil 
treatments over the three-month study. Outle t concentrations of  P from the three 
replicates for each of the sandy soil and fi eld soil tanks were compared using the 
mixed procedure of the Statis tical Analysis Software (SAS®) package. For all tests a  48p-level of 0.05 was used. Equation 1 was th e model used and it employed both fixed 
and random variables; the effect  of soil, time (ie week), and soil*time were fixed and 
the effect of the tank (nested within so il) and the residual error were random. 
    
Yijk = µ + soil i + week j + soil*week ij + tank ik + e ijk   (1)

Yijk is the observation of  ith soil in jth week in kth tank 
µ is the model constant 
eijk is the error associated with the  ith soil, jth week in the kth tank 
 
Four covariance structures were tested to model the e ijk for both the DRP and TDP 
data sets: Unstructured, Varian ce Components, Compound Symmetry and 
Autoregression 1. Autoregression 1 gave th e lowest Bayesian Information Criterion 
(BIC) value for both data sets with significantly better fit st atistics than the three other 
covariance structures. Table 3.2 summarizes  the covariance parameter estimates for 
the error associated with th e tank, the residual error of the model and the correlation 
(R) value of the covariance structure.

For both data sets, the Bayesian Inform ation Criterion value was not smaller upon 
running the model without th e random statement (tank); therefore, there was no 
improvement to the goodness of fit of the model with the random statement; ie there 
is no effect of the tank. Table 3.3 summarizes the tests of the fixed effects; for DRP 
the effect of soil was shown to be reasona bly significant at p= 0.088 and the effect of 
soil on TDP was significant at p=0.007. For both data sets there was an effect of time 
but no effect of the soil-by-week interac tion. This suggests that soil type and time do 
not combine to influence the overall average DRP or TDP (UCLA: Academic 
Technology Services, 2007). The effect of tim e reflects the fluctuations in the outlet  49concentration over the course of the study. The differences of the least square means 
between the two soil types for both DRP and TDP are not significant, p=0.9995 and 
0.9994, respectively. Overall, thes e results suggest that th e outlet concentration of 
TDP is significantly different from the in let, the DRP concentration is reasonably 
significantly different from the inlet, and there is no difference between the outlet 
DRP and TDP values of the two soil types.

3.4. Results and Discussion 
3.4.1.  Tracer study results 
The mean residence time was calculated using chemical reactor residence time 
distribution theory (Levensp iel, 1999). The experimental  tanks did not experience 
steady-state flows so the bromide concen tration found in each water sample taken 
every three hours, was multiplied by the flow during those three hours.  
 
(1) CT = C o (g L-1) x Q (L 3hrs-1) 
Where: 
CT = total grams bromide per 3hr time unit 
Co = sample bromide concentration 
Q = inflow rate (L 3hrs-1) 
 
With concentration converted into brom ide mass per unit time, it was possible to 
integrate the area under the curve to fi nd the total amount of grams recovered. 
(2) A= ⌠CT dt = ∑CTi ∆ti 
Where: 
A = area under curve 
i = 1,2,3,4…60 
∆ti = ith 3hr time unit 
CTi = is the grams of bromide from the ith 3hr time unit

The mean residence time (RT) was then calculated by: 
(3) RT= ⌠tCT dt = ∑tiCTi ∆ti 
                       ⌠CT dt  =  ∑CTi ∆ti         
Where: 
t = unit time (3 hrs) 
 
The active volume of a wetland is considered  to be the volume responsible for mixing 
of the system calculated by (Smith  et al. , 2005; Simi and Mitchell, 1999): 
(4) V a=Q a x RT  x 100 
                      V T 
Where:

 Q a = inflow rate (m3 day-1) 
VT = total volume of the wetland (4.17m3) 
 
Table 3.4 summarizes the results from  the bromide tracer test study. 
Unfortunately the datalogger recording the fl ow from replicate 1 of the field soil 
treatment failed and so it was impossible to calculate its retention time. However the 
retention times for the other replicates  were quite close to each other.

The calculated retention time for field soil replicates 2 and 3 and sand soil 
replicates 2 and 3 was very similar at  approximately 2.2 days. The active volume 
however, was seen to be greater in the sand soil  tanks than in the field soil tanks. It is 
possible that this is due to the increased ve getation density observed in the field soil 
tanks; Dierburg et al., (2005) have reported that in practice, wetland vegetation can  51result in a decrease in the effective vo lume ratio. Effective volume ratio, or active 
volume, is the measured retention time di vided by the theoretical retention time. The 
concept of the active volume is also know n as the mixing efficiency within the 
wetland and is characterized by the combined  effect of slow and fast flow paths 
(Kadlec, 2008). Despite the possible effect of the greater vegetation density lowering 
the active volume of the field soil tanks, the actual retention time was not different 
from the sand treatment tanks. 
The sand soil tank 1 had a much shorter retention time of only 1.3 days. This was 
a direct result of a much faster inflow rate due to an inconsistenc y in the inflow weir. 
It is likely that this  increased inflow volume also led to the bromide recovery of 115% 
which isn’t theoretically possible as th e background levels of bromide were 
undetectable. Samples were collected ev ery 3 hours and the concentration was 
integrated with the total outflow dur ing the 3 hour period. When the outflow 
concentration was at its peak and a sample was taken, it is possible that the particular 
concentration captured was higher than th e average for that 3 hour period, thus 
artificially inflating the ma ss recovered for that period. Th e mass recoveries obtained 
for the remaining four soil treatment tanks (61-84%) was consistent with what others 
have recovered in bromide tracer st udies in constructed wetlands; Smith et al., (2005) 
recovered 72-81% of the bromide from the tr acer tests performed in winter and spring 
on two constructed wetlands with rete ntion times of 14 to 19 days. Tanner et al., 
(1998) reported bromide recoveries of 82- 94% for three CW cells with retention 
times of 1 and 2 days. 
For all three treatment tanks, it was observed that the active volume decreased 
with an increase in retention time. It is likely that the degree of mixing is positively 
associated with increasing the active volum e and the intensity of  mixing within the 
wetland increases with wate r velocity (Kadlec and Knight, 1996). A Norwegian study 
of six surface flow constructed wetlands treating agricultural runoff heavy with 
particulate P, found a positive effect of increased hydraulic load on the phosphorus 
settling velocity, despite the decrease in residence time (Braskerud, 2002). Because 
the P was in dissolved form in this study, it is possible that th e degree of mixing and 
therefore active volume was not as important as retention time. It is interesting to note  52that despite the differences in active volume in the soil treatment tanks, the mean 
retention time was similar in four out of the five tanks tested. The outlier (sand tank 
1) had a greater inflow rate than the othe r four tanks due to a faulty weir, which 
explains the reduced retention time. This  suggests that the treatment occurring is 
almost equivalent in the two soil ty pes irrespective of active volume.  
 
3.4.2.  Phosphorous removal 
The outflow concentrations of DRP and TD P in all three treatments varied with 
inflow concentration. The outflow concentra tions were significantly lower than the 
inlet concentrations (p =0.08 and p=0.007 respectively) however there was no 
difference between the outlet concentrations from the two soil treatments themselves 
(p=0.9995 and P=0.9994 respectively). As seen in Figure 3.2, the outlet concentration 
curve of TDP of the two soil types follo wed the inlet concentration curve and 
interestingly, the sand soil and field soil follow a similar trend over the three month course of the study. The average inlet TDP concentration over the course of the study 
was 0.306 mg L
-1 and the average outlet TDP co ncentration from the field soil 
treatment was 0.161 mg L-1 and for the sandy soil treatment was 0.159 mg mg L-1 
with no significant difference between the two (Figure 3.3). This corresponds to an 
average decrease in concentr ation of 52%. The correspond ing values for DRP were 
consistently lower than TDP; however, th e associated standard error was much 
greater than that observed for TDP. 
In order to determine the total percent reduction for each tank the average weekly 
inlet and outlet concentrations for each tank were multiplied by the total number of 
litres that flowed out during the corres ponding week. In the two soil treatments, 
despite the load variability (due to inconsis tent flow rates between  the replicates), the 
percentage of the total grams of P that were retained by the wetland was similar between the treatment replicates (Table 3.5).

There was a difference in load of 13.8 g between sand tank replicates 1 and 3, yet 
the percentage of the load retained diffe red by less than 4%. Because this study took 
place over 87 days beginning July 5 and ending October 1, 2007, it is an inaccurate 
estimate of the yearly averag e because it would likely be inflated; a two-year study on 
a CW of the Walbridge River in Southe rn Quebec demonstrated an increased 
efficiency of P removal duri ng spring and summer (La Flamme  et al. , 2004). 
 TDP includes inorganic and organic form s of dissolved phosphorus and in this 
study, despite the lack of difference betw een the two soil types in TDP removal 
efficiencies, there was a larger standard e rror associated with the DRP than the TDP, 
making it difficult to detect a difference be tween them. It does however indicate that 
there was an organic fraction of the TDP in the outlet which would have resulted 
from the release of immobilized P from th e dead and decaying vegetation back into 
the water column. Based on total loads, inlet TDP was 75% DRP and 25% dissolved 
organic phosphorus (DOP) and sand soil outlet was 60% DRP and 40% DOP, with 
field soil outlet 65% DRP and 35% DOP (F igure 3.4). These data suggest that the 
DOP fraction was unaffected by the wetland tanks and the DRP fraction was reduced. 
This observation is congruent with other CW  studies where the outlet DOP was either 
similar to or greater th an the outlet DOP (Kovacic  et al. , 2000; Fink and Mitsch, 
2004).   55

The physicochemical properties of the we tland system dictate which P removal 
mechanisms will dominate, should P rem oval occur (Kadlec, 2005). Wetland nutrient 
cycling is dependent on the process dynami cs present within the system such as 
oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), dissolved oxygen (DO), pH and temperature 
(Sharpley, 1995; House  et al. , 1995). In general, the main  P-cycling pathways within 
a wetland can be grouped as sorption-d esorption, precipita tion-dissolution and 
immobilization-mineralization (Schoumans  and Chardon, 2003). P entering a wetland 
in either organic or inorganic form is subject to interconversion between the two. 
Inorganic P in the form of dissolved PO 43- ions can complex with ligands, either 
organic or inorganic, and these complexe s can become bound within the soil structure 
through the processes of adsorption and precipitation. Under aerobic conditions, P 
readily forms insoluble complexes with hydrous oxides of aluminum and iron and 
calcium (Sakadevan and Bavor, 1998; Ka dlec, 1994). Dissolved inorganic P (H 2PO 4-, 
HPO 42-, PO 43-) is also readily taken up by plan ts and microbes (immobilized) and 
converted into organic P forms. The litter from living organisms can re-release organic P into the system; it can either be converted back  into inorganic dissolved P 
(mineralized), remain imm obilized through incorporation into the sediments or exit 
the wetland as dissolved organic P. In this  CW it is likely that a combination of P 
dynamics was occurring however there was no net effect on the dissolved organic P 
fraction exiting the tanks.

Figure 3.5 shows the oxidation -reduction potential in th e water column over the 
three-month study period. During the firs t two weeks in August, the ORP dropped 
sharply in both soil treatme nts from almost +250 mV to below +100 mV in the sand 
tanks, and below +50 mV in the field soil ta nks. During the first week in September, 
the ORP dropped into the negative range; 0 to -70 mV in the sand tanks and to -150 
mV in the field soil tanks. The dissolv ed oxygen (Figure 3.6) in the water of both 
tanks dropped concurrently with the OR P during the first week in August from 
around 6 mg L-1 to just below 2 mg L-1, and remained there until the study was 
finished on October 1.

After the first month of operation, the c onditions in all six treatment tanks had 
become anaerobic, as indicated by the low ORP and low DO. This shift was in 
response to the tanks reaching equilibrium under saturated conditions; the tanks were 
filled with municipal water at the end of J une and until then had been empty of water 
since the previous summer explaining why aerobic conditions dominated throughout 
July. They were flushed with municipal water for a week before the agricultural 
runoff solution was introduced on July 5, 2007.  5702468101214

The introduction of nitrat e coupled with the very low flow rates, and the 
decomposition of plant detritus and organi c matter would have driven the shift 
towards anaerobic conditions. As oxygen was consumed by cellular respiration 
during the decomposition pro cess, the microorganisms would have switched from O 2 
to NO 3- as the metabolic electron acceptor.  As conditions became more reduced, 
nitrate reduction would have been follow ed by the reduction of manganese oxide, 
iron oxide, sulfate and then finally carbon dioxide (Patrick  et al. , 1996; Szogi  et al. , 
2004a).  In these experimental tanks, the ra te of oxygen consumption was greater than 
the amount entering in the inflow and the amount being diffused into the soil via the 
plant roots. This resulted in the reduced conditions obs erved at the beginning of 
August. While increasing rete ntion time has been shown to improve P retention, in 
this case it may not have improved the removal efficiency because of the reduced 
conditions and low dissolved oxygen. These parameters are fundamentally dictated 
by inflow rates and physical CW design and a ffect the level of tr eatment the polluted 
water will receive. The design of these tanks  coupled with the low inflow rate would 
have provided opportunity for dissolved or ganic carbon (DOC) to build up in the 
water column, thus promoting oxygen consum ption through bacterial respiration and 
driving the ORP levels down, inhibiting th e soil column to act as a P sink. 
  583.4.2.2.  Role of soil column in a constructed wetland 
The ability of soil to bind and retain  P through adsorption and precipitation is 
greatly influenced by its Al and Fe concen tration as well as the quantity of other 
exchangeable cations (CEC). Howeve r, under reducing conditions, these soil 
properties become ineffectual in P retention. The ORP conditions control the 
phosphate exchange processes between the water and soil interface (Lijklema, 1980). During the month of August, the ORP in the tanks of both soil types was in the range 
of -100 to +100 mV where, according to Patrick et al., (1996), the system can be 
considered anaerobic and reduced. It is in this range that Ferric-iron (Fe
3+) is reduced 
to soluble Ferrous-iron (Fe2+), releasing any bound ani on, including phosphate. The 
conditions in the field soil tanks reached highly reduced anaerobic status when the 
ORP level dropped to below -100mV at the beginning of September 2007. The 
reduced conditions observed in the tanks of the two soil treatments were low enough 
to transform the soils into a net source of P rather than a sink.  
It then becomes interesting to investig ate soil P levels; Figur e 8 shows the amount 
of P contained in the field soil and sand so il. The samples were taken in November 
2006 and November 2007, after the tanks were  drained for the wi nter. (During the 
summer of 2006 the tanks were flooded conti nuously for a period of six weeks with 
the same agricultural runoff solution). The P concentration was tested in each sample 
and the results for the two soil types are pool ed in Figure 3.7. It was assumed that the 
soil properties were c onstant between the Nove mber 2006 sampling and the 
beginning of the 2007 study, as the tanks were  drained at the end of October 2006 and 
not filled again until the beginning of the 2007 study. The average soil P 
concentration for the sand soil was 12.8 mg kg-1 in 2006 and 2007, suggesting no net 
retention of P over th e three month study.

Figure 3.7 . Mehlich 3 extracted P from sand soil and field soil tanks in November of 2006 and 2007(± 
std error). 
 
The P concentration in the field soil dropped 24.3% over the course of the study.  
It measured 41 mg kg-1 in November 2006 and to 31 mg kg-1 in November 2007. This 
observation supports the probability that the status of the reducing conditions was not 
only preventing P from binding onto soil partic les, but also releasing the stored P 
present in the soil. It is possible that b ecause of the coarser texture of the sand as 
compared to the field soil, there was enough oxygen diffusion into the soil pore water 
from plant roots to create aerobic microsites (Edwards  et al. , 2006) for exchange 
reactions to occur between soil particles and P; the overall effect of these sites being 
no net loss of soil P due to desorption. The observed ORP levels in the sand soil tanks 
did not reach as low as the levels seen in  the field soil which can be interpreted as 
there being more oxygen available in the sand than in the field soil, allowing the sand 
soil tanks to reach equilibrium with the in flow dissolved phosphorus. This occurred 
despite the sand soil containing less Fe and Al  than the field soil. The pH was taken 
weekly in the water column of the treatment tanks and it was found to hover at neutral 
in both soil treatments ranging between 7.23 a nd 7.83. It has been demonstrated that 
P removal efficiency of CWs improves as hydraulic retention time is increased 
(Akratos and Tsihrintzis, 2007); however, in anaerobic conditions such as observed in  60this study, increasing the hydraulic reside nce time has limited benefits without 
oxidizing the system. 
There is a discrepancy in the P cycling between the two soil types. Despite their 
overall same P retention, as seen in th e lack of difference between mean outlet 
concentration and percent removal calculated from loading rates, it is necessary to 
discuss the loss of soil P in the field soil. It  has been shown that loss of P from soil to 
the overlying water increases with highe r soil P concentration (Bostic and White, 
2006) and that a low average oxidation-reduc tion potential can increase the outflow 
iron (Fe) and P concentrations. Vohla, et al., (2006) found a nega tive correlation (R=-
0.59) between ORP and DRP and TP as well as  a lower soil P concentration in areas 
of their constructed wetland that were anaerobic. The dissolved oxygen and ORP in 
the tanks in this study did not differ signifi cantly between the inflow (deep zone) and 
outflow (shallow zone) thus suggesting th at the entire tanks were anaerobic and 
subject to loss of P from the soil.  
It was observed that 24% of the extractable  P in the field soil was lost during the 
3- month study; however, this was not tran slated into an increase in outlet P 
concentration with respect to the sand so il. The P released from the soil was likely 
taken up by the vegetation, as di scussed in section 3.4.2.3. As Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+ 
and phosphate ions are released, they become  available for plant uptake. The role a 
constructed wetland soil plays in P storage is much debated; Sakadevan and Bavor 
(1998) state that even th ough vegetative components (liv ing and dead) play an 
important role in short term P storage, it is the soil column that is most effective in 
long term P storage. Kadlec (2005) and Vy mazal (2006) argue that the sequestration 
of organic P in the accretion of residual s from the biogeochemical cycle (life and 
death of flora and fauna) and particulate sett ling to form new sediments and soil is the 
long term storage for P in a free water surface constructed we tland where emergent 
vegetation is present. Hafner and Jewe ll (2006) have even developed a simple 
mechanistic model to predict with P and N removal by constructed wetlands based on 
detritus accumulation with reasonable success.  
Our findings suggest compliance with so il accretion as the dominant storage 
mechanism due the anaerobic nature of the in  situ conditions in the tanks of both soil  61types. No net increase in soil P within th e sand tanks and a net loss of soil P within 
the field soil tanks suggest that the so il column was not se rving as a storage 
mechanism. This is congruent with Kadlec’s  (1996) statement that in surface-flow 
constructed wetlands, after the soil medium ha s become saturated [with water] and is 
considered hydric, its primary role is no l onger to filter P out of the water, but to 
sustain the vegetation and microbes whic h cycle P through th eir life and death. 
 
3.4.2.3.     Role of vegetation  
The vegetation density was gr eater in the field soil tanks than in the sand soil 
tanks as seen in the photo in Figure 3.8. The tank on the left is a field soil replicate 
and the tank on the right is a sand soil rep licate. In the field soil tanks, the cattails 
spread to the deep zones whereas they did not  in the sand tanks. Also in the field soil 
tanks, the reed canary grass spread into the cattail areas filling in the spaces between 
them, and this was seen to a much lesser extent in the sand ta nks. At the end of 
August 2007, the percent cover of the soil surface by the plants was estimated by dividing each tank into three quadrats and c ounting the reed canary grass tufts and 
cattail plants. It was found that the fiel d soil tanks had an average of 100 cattail 
shoots and the sand tanks had an average of  48 cattail shoots. Each tank was planted 
with 28-32 cattail transplants from a nearby pond  at the beginning of July. It was also 
estimated that the field soil tanks had 67% of the surface area c overed by reed canary 
grass and 40% cover in the sand soil tanks.  
 
Figure 3.8 . Photograph taken August 20, 2007 of a field soil tank replicate (left) and sand soil 
replicate.  62 
In this research site, it is likely that the additional P released from the field soil 
was incorporated into plant biomass as nut rient accumulation in plants depends on the 
rate of biomass production (Maddison  et al. , 2005); 50% greater cattail production in 
the field soil tanks and almost 30% more re ed canary grass than in the sand tanks was 
observed. Silvan  et al.,  (2004) also observed after the first year of a CW study, that 
vigorously colonizing vegetati on was a significant factor in P retention with an 
estimated 25% removal efficiency reported. To begin with, the field soil was richer 
than the sand soil and it was likely this  higher background nutri ent (both micro and 
macro) content supported the greater biomass production. It should also be 
emphasized that this was only the second gr owing season these tanks had experienced 
so the vegetative component was still in  the establishment stage (Gottschall  et al. , 
2007).  It is generally accepted that the primary role of ve getation in wetlands is to 
physically slow incoming water, promote b acterial processes and facilitate chemical 
processes; however, Brix (1997) sugges ts vegetation has a significant impact on 
nutrient reduction from wastewater when the loading levels are low. It is difficult to 
establish generalized criteria to CWs treating agricultural runoff as the concentration 
and volume of water being treated fluctuat e throughout the year. While there doesn’t 
appear to be a consensus in  the literature about what c onstitutes high and low loading 
rates, the loading rates used  in this study were 3.6 g m-2 per 87 days, approximately 
equivalent to 0.4 kg ha-1 d-1, and could be considered a lower load. Because the 
vegetation in the CW is still in the process of establishing itself, it is probable that the 
nutrient uptake increased with  increased biomass production in the field soil tanks 
and that it was this sink that offset th e excess DRP released from the soil column 
through plant assimilation.  
Gottschall  et al.,  (2007) studied nutrient removal and plant storage in a well-
established CW in eastern Ontario to dem onstrate this idea. Their CW consisted of 
five sections in series, the 2nd and 4th being surface-flow wetland cells, planted in 
1995 with Typha latifolia L.  L. and Typha angustifolia  L. They found that in the 2nd 
cell, there was a higher amount of nutrient s stored but there was no net change in 
storage over the course of the growing season. The 4th cell was less highly-loaded  63than the 2nd cell and exhibited a net increase in storage over the growing season. It is 
interesting to note however that the net incr ease in storage in th e second cell of this 
mature wetland accounted for less than 5% of the overall TP removal. While it is 
probable that the field soil tanks in this study had a larger amount of P incorporated 
into vegetation biomass duri ng the 2007 growing season, it can be expected that as 
the wetland matures, the importance of plan t assimilation as a P sink will decline year 
to year, despite being subject ed to lower loads (Edwards  et al. , 2006). 
 
3.5. Conclusions 
Two soil types common in Quebec, Canada, a sand soil and a sandy clay loam 
field soil, were used as substrates in su rface-flow constructed wetland tanks to assess 
their impact on P removal from an artificial agricultural runoff solution. A 
conservative tracer test was also performed to determine if there was a difference in 
mean hydraulic residence time between the two soil types. The following conclusions 
were drawn from this study: (1) The net removal efficiency between the sand soil and field soil surface-flow 
constructed wetland tanks in this study did not differ; both removed 
approximately 40% of the incoming TDP. There was no change in the soil P 
concentration of the sand so il and a 24% reduction in the field soil over the course 
of the study. This reduced soil P concentr ation in the sandy clay loam soil tanks, 
coupled with 50% more cattails and 30% more reed canary grass, suggests that 
plant assimilation compensated for the P released from the soil column due to the 
highly-reduced conditions. Low ORP in bot h soil types would ha ve prevented or 
reversed precipitation-adsorption reactions  and therefore resi dual organic matter 
accretion from the biogeochemical cycle was likely the dominant P sink for the 40% TDP that was successfully removed. 
 (2) Once the vegetation has fully colonized th e tanks after several years of operation, 
its role as a nutrient sink may diminis h. The field soil may act as a potential 
source of P due to its tendency to beco me more reduced than the sand tanks. 
  64 
(3) The hydraulic retention time was approxima tely 2.2 days for the tanks in this 
study. While increasing retention time has been shown to improve P retention, in 
this case it may not have improved the removal efficiency because of the reduced conditions. A difference between the field so il and sand soil’s ab ility to remove P 
may emerge as the CW ages, as the field soil had a larger pool of Melich III extractable iron than did the sand. Howe ver the active volu me of the wetland 
should be taken into consideration as the sand tanks had active volumes ranging 
from 56 to 74% whereas the field soil tanks were between 29 and 47%. This may 
indicate that there is mo re contact between the sand soil and polluted water than 
there is between the field soil and pollut ed water which would theoretically lead 
to the binding of more P.  
 (4) Acknowledging the fact that these surface fl ow CW tanks are s till in the process 
of establishment and maturation, the au thors of this study would recommend a 
sand soil for use as a CW wetland substrate in southern Quebec as there is less P 
to lose from the soil if ORP is low e nough to reduce iron and there is more water 
movement within the soil column
. 
 
3.6. Recommendations for future work 
(1) With an overall P removal of approximately 40%, the design of the vegetated 
tanks used in this research project could be improved to in an effort to increase 
the removal efficiency. A mixing device placed in the deep zone to aerate the water column could help increase the oxidation-reduction potential to a level 
where Fe
3+ is no longer being reduced, allowing it to react with dissolved P thus 
immobilizing it. In addition to impr oving the ORP conditions, increasing the 
hydraulic retention would allow mo re treatment within the CW.  
 (2) One of the limitations to this study was th at it didn’t address how this CW design 
would impact particulate P as is often pr esent in runoff events such as the spring 
snow melt. Further study of  the capacity of this desi gn to reduce particulate P  65from agricultural runoff would be interest ing as the deep zone combined with a 
slow inflow rate in theory shoul d allow for particulate settling.  
 
(3) Future work at this sight should include further testing for iron as well as plant 
tissue analysis. Outlet water sample analysis for soluble Fe2+ concentration as 
well as soil sample analysis for Fe concentration would confirm that the P loss 
from the soil was indeed coupled with the reduction of insoluble Fe3+ to soluble 
Fe2+. Plant analysis for P would complete the P mass balance and confirm that the 
P released from the soil was i ndeed taken up by the vegetation. 
 
(4) The tracer study conducted to determine the hydraulic residence of the tanks 
should be repeated three times. The results  would be more robust and suitable for 
statistical scrutiny with a triplicate data set.

Agricultural runoff containi ng phosphorus is indeed a thr eat to freshwater quality 
in Quebec. Phosphorus in runoff is almost always accompanied by high 
concentrations of nitrogen. N itrogen is also a threat to water quality as it also 
promotes eutrophication. The previous chap ter dealt with assessment of two wetland 
substrates in their ability to influe nce phosphorus retention in a surface-flow 
constructed wetland. The followi ng chapter explores how these same two substrates 
affects the ability of the c onstructed wetland to reduce nitr ogen from the same runoff 
solution.  694. Chapter 4- Comparison of Two Constr ucted Wetland Substrates for Reducing

4.1.Abstract 
Agricultural nonpoint source nitrogen is a threat to surface waters in Quebec due 
its ability to promote eutr ophication; a major threat to  water quality. Constructed 
wetlands are gaining interest for their role in treating nonpoi nt source nutrient 
pollution. This study was aimed at studying tw o substrates, a sandy clay loam field 
soil and a sand soil, used in  a surface-flow constructed wetland (CW), to compare 
how they influenced N retention. A seconda ry aim was to assess the production of 
nitrous oxide and determine if there was any difference between the two soil types. 
Field measurements were taken at a pilot- scale surface-flow constructed wetland site 
between July 5 and October 1, 2007. The s ite consisted of th ree replicate tanks 
containing the sandy clay loam and three containing the sand soil. The surface area of 
each tank was 9.29 m2 and was cylindrical in shape w ith a radius of 0.75 m. The inlet 
end was characterized by a deep zone which sloped upwards to a shallow zone which 
occupied 66% of the surface area and wa s planted with reed canary grass ( Phalaris 
arundinacea L.) and cattails ( Typha latifolia L.). The mean residence time was 2.2 
days. The tanks were flooded continuously fo r the duration of the study with artificial 
agricultural runoff solution containing 10 mg L-1 nitrate-N and 0.3 mg L-1 dissolved 
reactive P. The six treatment tanks recei ved 689 to 1100 g of N over the study period 
and the average rate of retention by sand tanks was 40 g m2 (±20) and 69 g m2 (±12) 
by the field soil tanks. This corresponded to average removal efficiencies of 41% and 
63% respectively, with the difference bei ng reasonably significan t (p=0.09). Nitrous 
oxide emissions from the tanks were al so measured and no difference was found 
between the two soil types (p=0.466). The mo re severely reduced conditions in the 
field soil tanks, coupled with higher avai lable carbon present in the organic matter, 
likely promoted a higher rate of complete denitrification (lower N 2O:N 2). The field 
soil also supported greater biomass produc tion compared to the sand soil, which  70would have resulted in a larger uptake of N.  This investigation s uggests that the sandy 
clay loam field soil has the capacity to retain more N than the sand soil due to a 
greater nutrient assimilation, organic matte r accretion rate and available carbon for 
supporting denitrifying mi crobial populations. 
 
4.2.Introduction and background 
Agricultural non-point source pollution (NPS) has been deemed the primary 
source of nitrogen and phosphorus overlo ading of freshwater bodies in North 
America (Kellogg and Maizel, 1994). As i ndustrial farms continue to intensify 
production, so does the use of nitrogen as a fertilizer. The excess N applied to fields 
come from both manure spreading and minera l N fertilizer applic ation. In the case of 
livestock producers, they of ten have more manure available for spreading over a 
limited amount of land, leading to over-app lication. In the case of crop producers, 
over-application of mineral fe rtilizer is common as maximum crop yield is the goal 
(Berka  et al. , 2001). Excess nitrate (NO 3) in surface and shallow ground water can 
contribute to eutrophication in receiving fr eshwater  and estuarine systems (Casey 
and Klaine, 2001). It is therefore importa nt to remove or reduce nitrogen from 
agricultural drainage water before it ente rs the receiving wate r bodies. Implementing 
on-farm best management practices (BMP s), in addition to manure management 
plans, are necessary for mitigating nutrient loss from agricultural land. BMPs such as  
riparian buffer strips along fields, catch ba sins along stream channels and constructed 
wetlands in runoff ditches, are examples of  structures useful for reducing nutrient 
loads from runoff (Michaud  et al. , 2005). 
Constructed wetlands (CWs) have proven e ffective in treating point source waste 
streams high in nitrogen such as manure pile runoff or milk house wash for example 
(Kadlec and Knight, 1996). This success has le ad to the increasing interest in using 
CWs to treat non point source pollution su ch as agricultural runoff (Raisin and 
Mitchell, 1995), which is characterized by large volumes of water with lower 
concentrations (Kovacic  et al. , 2000). The maximum allowable level for drinking 
water is 10 mg L-1 nitrate-N; however, it is known to  be an environmental threat to 
receiving water bodies at concentrations far below this. Depending on the individual  71water chemistries of the receiving water,  eutrophication has been documented to 
occur at concentrations of total N as low as of 0.4 N L-1 (Casey and Klaine, 2001). 
The most cost-effective long term management  option is controlli ng the source of the 
nutrients (Berka  et al. , 2001) by managing their applic ation to agricu ltural land. In 
addition, on-farm surface-flow constructe d wetlands are an interesting best 
management tool as the concept can be implemented with low initial investment 
capital and minimal maintenance. For the de sign of a CW however, it is important to 
understand the factors influenc ing the natural processes which occur within it and 
therefore its potential treatment efficiency.  
Denitrification is a central component of  the N cycle that returns inorganic N 
present in plants and soil s, of both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, to the 
atmosphere (Firth and Edwards, 2000; Wa tts and Seitzinger, 2000). CWs designed to 
remove N from inflowing water aim to capitalize on this microbially mediated 
process for permanent removal (Bachand and Horne, 2000). Microbial populations 
responsible for denitrifica tion can vary depending on their living conditions; the 
substrate and supply of nutrients within  the CW will ultimately dictate which 
microbial communities will flourish. Nitrous  oxide emission is an indicator of 
microbial denitrifi cation activity (Chang  et al. , 1998; Firth and Edwards, 2000) 
because the intermediary  of the reduction of NO 2+NO 3 to N 2 is nitrous oxide (N 2O). 
Influential environmental factors in a c onstructed wetland’s capacity to support 
denitrification include oxidation-reducti on potential (ORP), di ssolved oxygen (DO), 
temperature, pH and bioavailable  carbon (Kadlec and Knight, 1996).  
The goal of this research was to test if the soil substrate had an impact on a 
surface-flow constructed wetland’s ability  to reduce dissolved nitrogen from 
agricultural runoff. The more specific aim wa s to determine if there was a difference 
between two soil types common to Southern Quebec, Canada; a sandy clay loam field 
soil and a sandy soil, in their ability to reduce dissolved nitrogen from a simulated 
agricultural runoff solution. It  was expected that deni trification would be the 
dominant N removal mechanism and that  the field soil would support a greater 
amount of denitrifying activity due to its  greater carbon content. The simulated 
agricultural runoff soluti on contained 10 mg N L-1 as nitrate and 0.3 mg P L-1 as  72dissolved inorganic phosphorus, levels wh ich are commonly found in nonpoint source 
agricultural runoff in Southe rn Quebec (Eastman, 2008). In  order to compare these 
two soil types, dissolved N concentrations  at the inflow and outflow as well as 
dissolved oxygen, oxidation reduction potential , pH and temperature were monitored 
within a pilot-scale constructed site. This study was also interested to see if indeed 
N2O was being produced and how it changed in  the different subs trates over the 
course of the study. 
 
4.3.Methodology 
4.3.1.  Experimental Site 
The pilot-scale constructed wetland research site is located 3km north of McGill 
University’s Macdonald Campus in Ste- Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec, Canada. Details 
of this site may be found in Chapter 3. Br iefly, it consisted of six above-ground, black 
open, high density polyethylene (HDPE) half-c ylinder shaped tanks ; three of the six 
open tanks were filled with a sandy soil and the other three with a sandy clay loam 
field soil. Each tank had a volume of approximately 4.17m3 with 65% occupied by 
soil and surface area of 9.29m2.  Table 4.1 summarizes some of the soil properties of 
the two soil types.

At the inlet end of the tanks, there was a deep zone from which the soil sloped 
upwards to the shallow zone. The shallow zone occupied approximately 66% of the 
surface area and was vegetate d with alternating secti ons of reed canary grass 
(Phalaris arundinaceae L.) and cattails ( Typha latifolia L.). The water flowed from 
the deep zone, through the shallow ve getated section to the outlet.  
There were three mixing tanks located above the distribution tanks where the 
artificial runoff solution was mixed. The ta rget concentration of the runoff solution 
was 10 mg L-1 nitrate-N and 0.3 mg L-1 dissolved reactive phosphorous as  73orthophosphate. The corresponding N load ing rate was approximately 100 g m-2 per 
87 days, equivalent to 11.5 kg ha-1 d-1. The mean hydraulic residence time for the 
treatments tanks was 2.2 days with the excep tion of 1.3 days for th e first replicate of 
the sand soil tanks.

gas sampling chambers. 
 
4.3.2.  Water sample collection and analysis 
The study began July 5, 2007 by running municipal water through the treatment 
tanks. Water samples and water column info rmation such as dissolved oxygen (DO), 
oxidation-reduction potential (O RP), temperature and pH was collected to determine 
initial conditions. Starting July 10, 2007, the municipal water supply was stopped and 
the system started receiving the artificial runoff solution continuously until October 1, 
2007. Outlet water samples from each wetland treatment tank were collected by a 
custom-built Avensys autosampler every 42 hours in 1-L Nalgene HDPE bottles. Upon collection, a composite of the four samples collected every 42 hours from the 2
14
3 74same tank, was made by adding 30 mL of each into a 120-mL HDPE sample bottle. 
Therefore, a more representative sample was obtained because it was composed of a 
mixture of the four individual samples colle cted during that week. Grab samples from 
the mixing and distribution tanks were co llected as well. Water samples were 
collected weekly and immediately filtered  through 0.45 micron nylon membranes into 
acid-washed 120-mL Nalgene HDPE bottles . Non-filtered samples were also 
collected in acid-washed bottles and then tran sported in an ice-filled cooler back to 
the laboratory and stored in fridge at  4 ºC. Dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, oxidation-
reduction potential (ORP) and temperature da ta was collected weekly in the deep 
zone and shallow zone of vegetated tanks, as well as from the surface water of the distribution and mixing tanks. These data were  collected using a Ho riba portable pH 
meter (Model Series D-52, Horiba Internati onal Corporation, K yoto, Japan)  with 
corresponding DO probe, ORP probe, and a pH /temperature probe. All probes were 
calibrated and stored according to Horiba’s specifications (Horiba D series operation 
manual, 2001). 
Filtered water samples were analyzed for nitrate and nitrite-nitrogen (NO
3-N + 
NO 2-N), ammonia (NH 4) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), and unfiltered water 
samples were analyzed for total nitrogen (TN). All analyses  were carried out on a 
Lachat  Flow Injection Analysis System (Model QuikChem® 8500, Lachat 
Instruments, Loveland, Colorado). Dissolved nitrated was reduced to nitrite via a 
cadmium column, and then reacted with sulf anilamide with detection range of 0.2 to 
20 mg N/L (Egan, 2003). NH 4 analysis was carried out by heating the sample with 
salicylate and hypochlorite unde r alkaline conditions with detection range of 10 to 
500 µg N/L (Bogren, 2003). To measure TDN and TN, 5mL aliquots of the filtered 
and unfiltered samples were di gested with a peroxodisulfate oxidation method (Ebina  
et al. , 1983) and then analyzed for NO 3-N using the Lachat autoanalyzer. There was 
no difference between TDN and TN so it wa s concluded that no particulate N was 
entering or exiting the wetland tanks. TDN results will therefore be reported in this chapter. NO
2-N accounted for less than 0.1% of NO 3-N + NO 2-N so for this paper, 
values are reported as NO 3-N. Filtered water samples were also analyzed for 
dissolved organic carbon (DOC) with a Shimadzu TOC Analyzer (Model VCPN,  75Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD) using a combustion catalytic 
oxidation method (APHA  et al. , 1992). 
 
4.3.3.  Gas sample collection for nitrous oxide 
Gas samples were collected from 4 regions of each of the six treatment tanks 
biweekly between July 30th and September 28th, 2007. Cylinders measuring 1.95 m 
high by 0.265 m in diameter, capped with rem ovable air-tight lids that were fitted 
with a battery operated 10-cm computer fan, were used to collect gas samples from 
the treatment tanks. The 106-L chambers we re placed over 4 regions of the tank for 
30 minutes before being sampled and then moved to the next tank. The chambers 
were mixed continuously during the sampling time by the fans. A sample of ambient 
air was taken at time 0 for each tank. Every sampling date, the chambers were fitted on to collars fixed in the soil to ensure th at sampling occurred in  the same place each 
time.  
Three chambers were placed in the shallow zone and one in the deep zone. The 
chamber placed in the deep zone was 75 cm longer than the other three so that the 
headspace was equal to those in the shallow zone. In the shallow zone, one chamber 
was placed over a patch with no plants, one ove r a cattail, and one ove r a tuft of reed 
canary grass. Each chamber was f itted with a 30-cm piece of Taigon
® tubing 
protruding from the wall and fixed at th e end with a three-way stopcock. The two 
opposite ends of the stopcock  fit into the tubing and a 60-mL syringe respectively. 
The adjacent stopcock spout had a silicone se ptum glued to it. Each time a sample 
was withdrawn, the valve was turned to block the septum-covered spout and the 
syringe was pumped 10 times to ensure a mixed sample. When the syringe was filled, 
the valve was turned to block the chamber and another 60-mL syringe fitted with a 26 
gauge needle was inserted into the septum and a sample was withdrawn from the first 
syringe. Samples were collected by inserting a syringe into the sampling tube through 
a septa glued to the open end of a three way stopcock. The syringe was pumped ten 
times before withdrawing a sample and in jecting it into an ev acuated 12-mL soda 
glass Labco Exetainer® containing 0.5g magnesium perc hlorate as a dessicant. The 
Exetainers® were transported back to the lab in a protective car dboard box and the  76contents were analyzed within two days . The gas samples were analyzed for N 2O on a 
Gas Chromatograph (GC) equipped with el ectron capture detector-ECD (Model 5890 
Series, Hewlett-Packard, Hewlett-Packar d Company, Avondale, PA). The method of 
rapid analysis of N 2O, developed by (Mosier and Mack, 1980), was used in this 
experiment. 
 
4.3.4.  Data Analysis 
A statistical model using repeated measur es over time was employed to determine 
if the outlet concentrations of NO 3-N, NH 3-N, dissolved organic N, TDN and DOC 
were different between the sand soil and field soil tr eatments over the three-month 
study. Outlet concentrations from  the three replicates for each of the sandy soil tanks 
and field soil tanks were compared usi ng the mixed procedure of the Statistical 
Analysis Software (SAS®) package. For all tests we a ssumed a strong significance at 
ά =0.05 and reasonabl e significance at ά =0.1. Equation 1 was the model used and it 
employed fixed and random variables; the eff ect of soil, time (ie week), and soil*time 
interaction were fixed and the effect of the tank (nested wi thin soil) and the residual 
error were random. The soil term included th e inlet as well as outlet concentration.

Four covariance structures were tested to model the e ijk for both all the nitrogen 
species and DOC data sets: Unstruct ured, Variance Components, Compound 
Symmetry and Autoregression 1. Autoregr ession 1 gave the lowest Bayesian 
Information Criterion (BIC) value for all data sets with significantly better fit 
statistics than the three other covariance st ructures. It should be  noted that the DOC 
model was not run with the inlet concentr ation (due to less frequent sampling) 
therefore the comparison was lonely betw een the two soil types. Despite there no  77difference between soil (p=0.1981), they were  different from the influent the first 
week in September as determined by a t-test.

Nitrous oxide results were analyzed us ing a randomized complete block design 
analysis of variance to determine if there was a difference between the collar 
positions (including ambient air) on each sampling date and to determine if there was an overall difference in N
2O emissions between the sand soil, field soil and ambient 
on each sampling date. Statistical analysis was carried out using the model in 
equation 2 in the GLM procedure of th e Statistical Analysis Software (SAS®) 
package.

On all five sampling dates, there wa s no significance between two of the 
parameters; soil by position interaction (diffe rences of least square means adjusted 
with Scheffe) or differences between emissi ons from the two soil types (differences 
of least square means adjusted with Scheffe). However, on all five sampling dates 
there was a difference between the soil tr eatments and ambient concentration.  
    784.3.5.  Results and Discussion 
The outlet TDN and NO 3-N concentrations of the two soil types followed a 
similar trend over the three month course  of the study (Figures 4.2 and 4.3). The 
outlet concentration began to  decrease between August 6th and 13th (weeks 6 and 7). 
The September 10th sampling day (week 11) indicates  a large pulse release of TDN 
and NO 3-N from the sand tanks and corresponding smaller one from the field soil 
tanks. It can be speculated that a drop in temperature which occurred during this week 
caused a die-off of some of the denitrif ying bacteria, inhibitin g treatment of the 
inflow water for that particular week be fore the population re adjusted itself. The 
daytime water temperature inside the tanks  experienced a drop from 22.4 C to 16.6 C, 
which was the largest change observed over th e course of the study (Figures 4.2, 4.3).  
Many studies have demonstrated that mi crobially mediated processes, including 
both nitrification and den itrification, are temperature dependent (Rousseau  et al. , 
2001; Kuschk  et al. , 2003; Mander  et al. , 2003). Kuschk et al., ’s (2003) four year 
study of N removal in a subsurface flow CW demonstrated that removal rates 
oscillated year round. They found denitrif ication was restricted during spring and 
autumn as a result of annual temperat ure changes and probably limited by carbon 
source. Carbon-limitation is not suspected to  be the cause of the outlet spike in N 
concentration due to abrupt nature and increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) 
observed in the same sample. It is suspected  that the sudden decrease in temperature 
in the same week is responsible for the lack  of treatment that o ccurred. The spike in 
outlet concentration was greater in the sand soil than the field soil likely due to the sparser vegetation cover, co rresponding to a lower density microbial population. The 
inlet TDN and NO
3 concentrations show fluctuations, most likely due to the timing of 
the addition of the KNO 3 to the mixing tank.  7905101520

When comparing outlet concentration, th e difference between the TDN average 
outlet concentration of the sand tanks and field soil tanks was reasonably significant 
(p=0.097). The average inlet TDN concen tration (calculate d from the weekly 
samplings of the mixing tank and two dist ribution tanks) was 11 +/- 1.5 mg N/L with 
outlet TDN concentration from the sand soil tanks at 4.7 mg N/L and from the field 
soil tanks at 3.6 mg N/L (Fi gure 4.4). A similar trend wa s observed with the outlet 
NO 3-N concentration; for the sand soil it  was 2.8 mg N/L and 1.9 mg N/L for the  80field soil. However, the difference be tween the least s quare means for NO 3-N 
concentration between the two soil types was not signi ficantly different (p=0.122).

Ammonia concentration in the inlet and outlets was monitored to determine if 
ammonification was occurring within the treat ment tanks or with in the distribution 
tanks. Even though NH 4 was not added to the simulated agricultural runoff, small 
amounts were produced. Despite the mi nimal overall contribution of NH 4 to the 
inorganic dissolved nitrogen fraction, it’s inte resting to compare the fate of ammonia 
in both soil types.  
The inflow NH 4 concentration ranged from below detection limit (10 µg N L-1) to 
38.2 µg N L-1, except on September 10th (week 11) and October 1st (week 14) when 
values of 149 and 381 µg N L-1 respectively, were obs erved (Figure 4.5).  81-200-1000100200300400500

 The outflow concentration trend was ag ain similar between the two soil types 
with peaks on July 30
th and September 3rd (weeks 5 and 10) a nd sand displayed the 
greatest outflow concentration. In fact th ere was no difference between the average 
inflow NH 4 concentration which was 116 and sand  soil outflow concentration of 107 
µg N L-1 (p=0.727).  
However the average field soil tank outlet NH 4 concentration was 63 µg N L-1 
which was significantly lower than the in let and sand soil outl et concentrations 
(p=0.054). This would suggest that ammoni fication took place to a small degree in 
the reservoir tanks and was unaffected by th e sand soil tanks, and reduced by the field 
soil tanks.  
Ammonification describes the biological  conversion of organic nitrogen to 
ammonia which is the first step of or ganic N mineralization (Reddy and Patrick, 
1984). NH 4 is a reduced form of nitrogen and needs to be oxidized to NO 2 and NO3 
in order to be further converted to N 2 gas through denitrificat ion (Kadlec and Knight, 
1996). Once organic N has been converted into NH 4, which is present in water as 
NH 4+, it can then undergo volatilization to NH 3 gas or be assimilated microbially or 
through plant uptake or be oxidized to nitr ate. The conditions under which each step 
occurs is heavily influenced by the medley  of environmental factors that make up a 
wetland ecosystem. The rate of ammonificati on is much slower under anaerobic than  82aerobic conditions; however, ammonia nitroge n is more likely to accumulate in 
anaerobic environments due to decreased nitrification rates ca used by low oxidation-
reduction potential and low dissolved oxyge n concentrations (Reddy and Patrick, 
1984). It is possible that th e field soil with its high er density of plant roots 
experienced a more consistent aerobic la yer at the water/soil interface to support a 
microorganism population capable of oxidizing NH 4+ to NO 3- (Wu, 1999). It is also 
possible that NH 4+ ions were adsorbed as exchangeab le ions on clay particles present 
in the soil or incorporated into the physical clay latt ice structure (Vymazal, 2006).  
In order to determine the total percent reduction for each tank, the average weekly 
inlet and outlet concentrations for each ta nk were integrated with the corresponding 
weekly flow. In the two soil treatments, there was variability in the input load (due to 
inconsistent flow rates between the replicat es), however it does not correlate with the 
output load. The sand soil tanks removed a co mbined total of 40% of the inflow TDN 
and the field soil tanks removed a comb ined total of 63% of inflow TDN. 
The inflow TDN was composed, on average, of 1% NH 4, 11% Org N and 88% 
NO 3. Despite the fact that only NO 3-N was added to the simulated runoff solution, 
some of the N was transformed into orga nic and ammonia fracti ons. This was likely 
due to algae and microbial contamination within the holding tanks and was combated 
by covering them with dual-sided black a nd white tarps. This same phenomenon was 
observed in another experiment where they  were using simulated nursery runoff and 
were only able to maintain a NO 3-N fraction of 80% (Huett  et al. , 2005). The 
breakdown of the outlet TDN components fo r the two soil treatments was slightly 
different; the outlet from sand it was 2% NH 4, 27% Org N and 71% NO 3, and from 
the field soil tanks it was 2% NH 4, 36% Org N and 62% NO 3. Figure 4.6 
demonstrates the overall composition of the dissolved nitrogen entering and exiting 
the wetland tanks as well as the overall pe rcentage of each contributing species of 
nitrogen. Nitrate experienced the largest re lative reduction in both soil types; it was 
reduced by 52% by sand soil tanks and 74% fr om field soil tanks and denitrification 
was suspected to be  the largest sink. NH 4 on the other hand, was increased by 14% in 
the sand soil tanks and reduced by 28% by the field soil tanks.   83

out from each soil type (left). Nitrogen species com position of 100% total dissolved going in and out 
of the two soil types (right). 
 
The dissolved organic N (DON) load was in creased in the sand soil tanks by 42% 
and 20% by the field soil tanks. Despite great er TDN retention by the field soil, it is 
interesting to note that a greater percenta ge of the N exiting the wetland was in the 
dissolved organic form.  
The vegetation density was greatest in the field soil tanks which necessarily 
corresponded to a larger biomass and therefor e, organic N pool so it is possible that 
more of the NO 3 was being converted into DON. When comparing DON 
concentration over the cour se of the study, there wa s no significant difference 
between the inlet and outlet concentrations of the two soil types throughout the study 
(p=0.504), as visualized in Figure 4.7.  
Despite the fact that ther e was no difference in outlet DON concentration between 
the two soil types and it di d not significantly change ove r time, it accounted for a 
larger fraction of the total TDN output by th e field soil tanks. Internal organic matter 
loading caused by senescing plants is known to increase DON loading (Sartoris  et al. , 
2000; Thullen  et al. , 2005), and the field soil tank s experienced almost 50% more 
vegetation cover by the end of the study. This  shows that the field soil tanks were 
more effectively removing the NO 3 than the sand soil tanks, as well as better retaining 
DON produced by plant and microbial life cycling. 0500100015002000250030003500

Despite the seemingly large difference in  removal efficiency between the sand 
and field soil tanks (40% and 63% respectiv ely), it is important to note the variation 
between the three replicates of each treat ment. Table 4.3 outlines the total grams of

4.3.6.  Denitrification 
4.3.6.1.  Physicochemical properties 
In order to determine if denitrification was indeed occurring in the wetland tanks, 
several parameters known to influence this process were monitored. Oxidation-
reduction potential, dissolved oxygen, te mperature and pH measurements were 
measured weekly from two regions inside the tanks; the deep zone at the inlet end of 
the tank and the shallow zone at the outle t end. There was no significant difference  85between the two zones in each tank therefor e the results were grouped together for 
each tank. 
Wetland nutrient cycling is dependent on th e process dynamics present within the 
system such as oxidation reduction potentia l, dissolved oxygen, pH and temperature 
(Sharpley, 1995) (House  et al. , 1995). Figure 4.8 shows the oxidation-reduction 
potential in the water column  over the three month study.

During the first two weeks in August,  the ORP dropped sharply in both soil 
treatments from almost +250 mV to be low +100 mV in the sand tanks, and below 
+50 mV in the field soil tanks. During th e first week in September the ORP dropped 
into the negative range; 0 to - 70 mV in the sand tanks and to -150 mV in the field soil 
tanks. The dissolved oxygen (Figure 4.9) in the water of both tanks dropped 
concurrently with the ORP during the fi rst week in August from around 6 mg L-1 to 
just below 2 mg L-1 and remained there until the study was finished on October 1rst.  
After the first month of operation. the c onditions in all six treatment tanks had 
become anaerobic, as indicated by the low ORP and low DO. This shift was in 
response to the tanks reaching equilibrium under saturated conditions; the tanks were 
filled with municipal water at the end of J une and until then had been empty of water 
since the previous summer so aerobic c onditions dominated th roughout July. They  86were flushed with municipal water for a w eek before the agricultural runoff solution 
was introduced on July 5th, 2007.

The introduction of nitrate,  coupled with the very low flow rates, and the 
decomposition of plant detritus and organi c matter would have driven the shift 
towards anaerobic conditions. As oxygen was consumed by cellular respiration 
during the decomposition process, the microorganisms switch from O 2 to NO 3- as the 
metabolic electron acceptor. As conditions become more reduced, nitrate reduction is followed by manganese oxide, iron oxide, sulf ate and then finally  carbon dioxide is 
reduced (Patrick  et al. , 1996; Szogi  et al. , 2004a).  In these experimental tanks, the 
rate of oxygen consumption was greater th an the amount entering in the inflow and 
the amount being diffused into the soil via the plant roots. This resu lted in the reduced 
conditions observed at the beginning of August. During the month of August, the 
ORP in the tanks of both soil types was in the range of -100 to +100 mV where 
according to Patrick et al.,  (1996), the system is cons idered anaerobic and reduced. 
The conditions in the field soil tanks reached  highly reduced anaerobic status when 
the ORP level dropped to below -100mV at  the beginning of September, 2007. Miller 
and Gardiner (1998) explain th at when rice paddies are flooded, the degree to which 
the conditions become reduced is impacted by the organic matter c ontent of the soil. 
They noted when comparing the flooding of two soils with similar pH, the one with  87the greatest OM content will experience the most reduced conditions which could 
explain in our case, why the field soil was more reduced than the sand soil.  
 
4.3.6.2.  Dissolved organic carbon 
In addition to the soil OM, it is interesting to compare the concentrations of DOC 
coming out of the two soil types as seen in  Figure 4.10. According to the statistical 
model, there was no effect of soil (p= 0.198) on DOC outlet concentration; however, 
there was an effect of the soil by time in teraction (p=0.0364). The concentration from 
both tanks increased after week 11 (September  10) by more than a factor of 2, and it 
was at this point that  the outlet concentration was great er than the inle t concentration. 
The inlet agricultural solution was mixed with municipal water which was the exogenous DOC source therefore, the inlet so lution was tested for DOC monthly as it 
was expected to be consistent. The sim ilar DOC concentration between soil types 
leaching from detritus accumulation within the tanks was similar, despite the field 
soil tanks having greater vegetation densit y. However, when total DOC loads were 
compared between the two soil types, the field soil tanks had a 10% overall greater 
output than the sand soil tanks. From the pe rspective of the local environment within 
the tanks, DOC concentration is important  because it shows that the microorganisms 
were subjected to the same concentr ation. OM matter accumulation between 2006 
and 2007 was 1.2 fold in the field soil tanks and close to 4 fold in the sand soil tanks 
(Table 4.1) but due to a larg e error this increase was not significant in the sand soil 
tanks. This is consistent with a New Z ealand study on OM accretion where it was 
found that in the first two years of operation it increased 1.2-2 fold and decreased in 
the following years (Tanner  et al. , 1998).  880102030405060708090

4.3.6.3.  Nitrous oxide emissions 
As well as monitoring the parameters in  the water column known to influence 
denitrification, gas sampling was also conduc ted biweekly to determine if nitrous 
oxide was being produced in the tanks. Ob served nitrous oxide emissions peaked on 
the August 14th sampling date and declined steadily until the study ended at the end of 
September, 2007 (Figure 4.11). The emission ra te for each soil type was determined 
by treating the four samples from each tanks as replicates for the individual tank so 
n=12 for each soil type. There was no statis tically significant difference between the 
emission rate of the two soil types on each given sampling date. The N 2O emission 
rate from the sand soil was 65 µg m-2 hr-1 on the first sampling date (July 30th) and 
then increased to129 µg m-2 hr-1 on August 14th before starting to decline. This can be 
explained by the trend in reducing cond itions; anaerobic conditions dominated the 
first month of operation as the soils had b een dry previous to flooding. As the system 
was making the shift from aerobic to anaer obic conditions, denitrication began to 
occur as seen by the N 2O emission as well as the decrea sing outlet concentration of 
the NO 3 component of the TDN (Freeman  et al. , 1997). The August 14 sampling date 
shows the highest emission rates because DO and ORP were continuing to decrease 
thus increasing the reducing conditions and further promoting denitrification. In the 
field soil tanks however, the July 30 and August 14 sampling dates were almost the 
same (97 and 101 µg m-2 hr-1 respectively) and then starte d to decrease similarly to 
the sand soil tanks. This difference in th e first two weeks was likely less pronounced  89than in the sand due to the greater intrin sic available carbon as  related to the OM 
content of the field soil. The overall tre nd of decreasing nitrous oxide emissions and 
decreasing outlet TDN concentrations as  the summer progressed indicated the 
denitrification reaction became more efficient, resulting in a lower N 2O:N 2 ratio 
(Thomas  et al. , 1994; Bastviken  et al. , 2005) (Smith and Tiedje, 1979). This 
increased denitrification woul d have been heavily influenced by the available carbon 
status within the tanks (Thomas  et al. , 1994) (Hunt  et al. , 2003).  
The increased OM between 2006 and 2007, a nd the increased DOC concentration 
from the outlet of all the tanks was indicat ive of an increasing carbon pool within the 
system. This corresponds to the seasonal vegetation growth and inherent litter 
accumulation within the systems. As nitrous oxide is an intermediary in the overall 
reduction reaction of NO 3 in solution to N 2 gas that is related to  carbon availability, it 
is possible that accumulation of carbon as plant litter within the tanks aided in 
reducing incomplete denitrif ication as the summer progr essed, thus supporting low 
TDN outputs and minimizing N 2O emissions. This is impor tant as nitrous oxide 
emission is an indicator of microbial deni trification activity but is also a potent 
greenhouse gas (Chang  et al. , 1998; Firth and Edwards, 2000). This is consistent with 
the results of a study on a CW  treating swine wastewater in South Carolina where 
they found that as total soil carbon increased, the amount of incomplete 
denitrification decreased. Firestone et al., (1980) postulated that as conditions become 
increasingly anoxic, an in crease in nitrous oxide produc tion follows. It is then 
consumed however, as a result of the stimulated nitrogenous oxide reductase 
enzymes, which reduce nitrous  oxide to nitrogen gas. 
The results averaged for each soil type are presented in Figure 4.11 the 
contribution from the individual sampling chambers are presented in Figure 4.12 to 
visualize the contribution of each to the averages.    900255075100125150175

In the field soil tanks, sampling position 1 (deep zone) was significantly different 
from ambient on two of the middle sampling dates (p=0.034 and p=0.049 
respectively) and position 2 (bare soil) wa s significant on the three middle sampling 
dates (p=0.089, p=0.064, and p=0.043 respectiv ely). Position 3 (cattail) was not 
significant on any sampling dates and positi on 4 (reed canary grass) was significant 
on the first sampling date (p=0.012).  
This was almost exactly opposite of the trend seen in the sand soil tanks; positions 
1 and 2 were only significant on one sampling day each (p=0.032 and p=0.008 
respectively) however positions 3 and 4 were reasonably significant on two and four 
sampling days respectively (p=<0.1). It is di fficult to detect any trends within this 
information; however, it is interesting that  the contributions from each position are 
not equivalent for each sampling date for either soil types.  
It does appear that as the study c ontinued, the microbial population was 
increasing the active denitrifi cation zone from the inlet e nd to the outlet end, as seen 
by the greater relative cont ribution of positions 3 and 4 on the last two sampling 
dates. This was perhaps most pronounced in  the sand soil tanks as positions 3 and 4 
were significant as the sampling dates progressed.  91

The pattern in the field soil tanks was not  as evident perhaps due to an already 
present microbial population a nd available carbon within the OM. Other studies have 
shown that plants acts as conduits for rele asing gases produced in the deeper soil 
layers and so it was suspected that perhap s there would be a difference between the 
sampling positions within the wetland tanks (Chang  et al. , 1998; Chen  et al. , 1999).  
The results from this study suggest spatial heterogeneity  in terms of N 2O

4.3.6.4.  Role of vegetation 
The vegetation density was gr eater in the field soil tanks than in the sand soil 
tanks by the end of the study. All tanks were originally planted w ith the same number 
of cattails and of reed cana ry grass tufts; however, the field soil tanks had twice as 
many cattails and 30% more surface area covered by reed canary grass (data 
presented in Chapter 3, section 3.4.2.3). Wh ile biomass concentrations were not 
tested due the destructive nature  of the tests and small size of  the tanks, in this study it 
is probable that more N was incorporated in to plant biomass in the field soil tanks as 
nutrient accumulation in plants depends on the rate of biomass production (Maddison  
et al. , 2005). Because the vegetation in this CW was still in the process of 
establishing itself, the nutrient uptake incr eased with increased biomass production. It 
is likely this higher bioma ss production in the field soil tanks, was responsible for a 
greater proportion of the nutri ent removal, than in the sand soil tanks. The field soil 
was richer than the sand soil and it was likely this higher ba ckground nutrient (both 
micro and macro) content supported the higher biomass production. It should be 
emphasized that this was only the second gr owing season these tanks had experienced 
so the vegetative component was still in the establishment stage when N assimilation 
is greater than in established CWs (Gottschall  et al. , 2007).  
As well as assimilation and microbial s upport, vegetation performs the critical 
role of supplying or increasing the la yer of organic matter (OM) (Edwards  et al. , 
2006). High accretion rates of plant detritus in surface flow CWs is an important 
source of OM which provides a sustai nable supply of carbon for microbial 
denitrification (Tanner  et al. , 1998). Brix (1997) suggests ve getation has a significant 
impact on nutrient reduction through orga nic matter accumulation only when the 
loading levels are low. While there doesn’t ap pear to be a consensus in the literature 
about what constitutes high and low loading rates, field scale nonpoint source waste 
streams such as agricultural runoff vary in concentration and volume throughout the 
year, thus varying the loading rates. Many studies report high N uptake by plants in 
the first 3-5 years of operati on while plant cover is being established; however, it’s  93questionable whether or not plant uptake is  a sustainable removal mechanism in the 
long term. For example a 5-year old CW wetland planted with Phalaris. 
Arundinaceae L. (reed canary grass), demonstr ated that N assimilation was 
significant in the first half of the growing season and the overall N uptake by plants 
was 9.2% of the incoming N (Edwards  et al. , 2006). Another study on 10-year old 
CW, planted with Typha latifolia  L. and Typha angustifolia  L (two species of cattail) 
in eastern Ontario demonstrated th is idea; it was found that in the 4th cell in series, 
which was less highly-loaded than the previ ous cells in which there was no net plant 
storage, that over the growing season the plants removed 9% of the total Kjeldahl 
nitrogen (Gottschall  et al. , 2007).  
An important consideration when assessing th e role of plants is that they may act 
as temporary storage for N (Silvan  et al. , 2004), for example standing dead cattail 
shoots as well as roots and rhizomes can ha ve a turnover rate of one or two years 
(Kadlec and Knight, 1996). While it is not a perm anent storage, this is important as it 
prevents overloading of the receiving wa ter bodies during the growing season, when 
they are at their most vulnerable (Kao  et al. , 2004; Gottschall  et al. , 2007; Kroger  et 
al., 2007). Picek et al., (2007) demonstrated that in CW s that are not heavily loaded 
with wastewater, plants are of primary im portance as a source of available carbon for 
microorganisms as well as providing plan t exudate which also affect microbial 
processes and pore water quality, thus incr easing the efficiency of nitrogen removal 
from the wastewater by supporting deni trifying microorganisms with easily 
decomposable organic matter. 
 
4.4.Conclusions 
 Two soil types common to Southern Quebec, Canada, a sand soil and sandy clay 
loam field soil were assessed in their ab ility reduce dissolved nitrogen from a 
simulated agricultural runoff so lution containing 10 mg N L-1 as nitrate. It was 
expected that the field soil would outperf orm the sand soil in N removal because of 
its greater organic matter content and asso ciated carbon content, as well as its 
capacity to support a greater vegetation density. Denitrification and biomass  94sequestration were the hypothesized domi nant N sinks in th is two-year old 
constructed wetland. The following conclu sions were drawn from this work: 
 
(1) This study demonstrated that field soil was better at promoting de nitrification than 
sand soil that was planted with cattails and reed canary grass and with an average 
hydraulic retention time of 2.2 days when  flooded with simulated agricultural 
runoff, typical in Quebec.  
 
(2) The field soil tanks outperformed the sa ndy soil tanks with an overall removal of 
63% TDN compared to 41% TDN removal. It was likely due to the richer soil 
having been able to support a larger vegetation biomass which was in turn 
responsible for greater nutrient assim ilation, OM accretion rate and available 
carbon, for supporting greater microbial populations. 
 
(3)  As demonstrated by the decreasing dissolved  N concentrations in the outflow, as 
well as dissolved oxygen and oxidation-reduc tion potential within the tanks, the 
water column conditions were anaerobi c after the first m onth of operation. 
Denitrification was also apparent th rough the observation of nitrous oxide 
emissions coming from both soil types. While there was no significant difference 
in emission rates between the two soil types, it was likely that more N 2O was 
being further reduced to N 2 in the field soil tanks, due to the higher carbon 
availability.  
 
(4) Nitrogen transformations occurred in both soil types; NH 4+ was produced in the 
sand soil tanks and the outflow contained 14%  more than the inflow. In contrast, 
the field soil tanks removed 28% of the inflowing NH 4+, probably due to the 
higher root-rhizome density and corre sponding aerobic microzones where NH 4+ 
would have been reduced to NO 3. Dissolved organic nitrogen was also produced 
in both tanks with 20% more in the outlet from the sand than field soil tanks. This 
may have been caused by the more severe ly reduced conditions in the field soil 
tanks under which OM accumulates more quickly thus sequestering DON.   95(5) DOC concentration increased in the outle t from both soil types in September, 
2007. As well as being an indication of car bon loading within both systems, it is 
an indication of potential BOD 5 being produced. It would be pertinent to monitor 
this in future studies of this site.

5. Chapter 5- General Summary and Conclusions 
 
5.1. General Summary 
 
Intensification of agricultural  practices in Quebec has lead to an increase in water 
quality deterioration in its freshwater lakes and rivers. Agricultural runoff has been 
recognized as the primary pathway for th e transport of phosphorus and nitrogen to 
fresh water bodies. Constructed wetlands as a filtration structure to reduce the P and 
N load in runoff is a potential best mana gement strategy; however, design criteria 
have not been optimized for the treatment of  nonpoint source waste streams in colder 
climates. The goal of this research was to study the impact on nutrient reduction by a 
constructed wetland using two so il types common in Quebec. 
This research project endeavored to comp are two different subs trates in surface-
flow constructed wetlands with emergent  vegetation. The capacity of a sandy soil and 
a sandy clay loam soil to in fluence the removal mechanisms for P and N was studied 
between July, 2006 and October, 2007. 
A simulated agricultural solution was passed through three sandy soil and three 
sandy clay loam soil-filled wetland tanks fr om July 10 to October 1, 2007, and inlet 
and outlet water samples were collected weekly. They were analyzed for total N, nitrate and ammonia, organic N, total P, di ssolved P, and organic P. Flow data was 
collected in order to calcu late total loads. The physico-chemical conditions of 
oxidation-reduction potential, dissolved oxygen, pH and temp erature, were monitored 
weekly within the experimental tanks and gas samples were collected and analyzed 
for nitrous oxide. Soil samples were anal yzed annually and th e vegetation percent 
ground cover was estimated annually. In Oct ober 2007, a conservative tracer test was 
conducted to elucidate the mean hydraulic  retention time of the wetland tanks.  
Chapter three addresses the difference in P load removal efficiency between the 
two soil types as well as the mean hydraulic re tention time determined from the tracer 
study. Chapter four addresses the results of the removal of N by the two soil types, as 
well as the nitrous oxide produc tion observed in each one.

5.2. Conclusions 
 
The following conclusions were drawn from this study: 
(1) The net removal efficiency between the sand soil and field soil surface-flow 
constructed wetland tanks in this study did not differ; both removed 
approximately 40% of the incoming TDP. There was no change in the soil P concentration in the sand soil and a 24% reduction in the field soil over the course 
of the study. This reduced soil P concen tration, coupled with  50% more cattails 
and 30% more reed canary grass in the field soil tanks suggests that plant 
assimilation compensated for the P released from the soil column due to the highly-reduced conditions. Low ORP in bot h soil types would ha ve prevented or 
reversed precipitation-adsorption reactions  and therefore residual organic matter 
accretion from the biogeochemical cycle was likely the dominant P sink for the 40% TDP that was successfully removed. Once the vegetation has fully colonized 
the tanks after several year s of operation, its role as a nutrient sink may diminish. 
The field soil may act as a potential sour ce of P due to its tendency to become 
more reduced than the sand tanks. 
 
(2) The hydraulic retention time was approxima tely 2.2 days for the tanks in this 
study. While increasing retention time has been shown to improve P retention, in 
this case, it may not have improved the removal efficiency because of the reduced conditions. A difference between the field so il and sand soil’s ab ility to remove P 
may emerge as the CW ages, as the field soil had a larger pool of Melich III 
extractable iron than did the sand. Howeve r, the active volume of the wetland 
should be taken into consideration as the sand tanks had active volumes ranging 
from 56 to 74% whereas the field soil tanks were between 29 and 47%. This may 
indicate that there is mo re contact between the sand soil and polluted water than 
there is between the field soil and pollut ed water which would theoretically lead 
to the binding of more P.  
 
  101(3) Acknowledging the fact that these surface-fl ow CW tanks are s till in the process 
of establishment, the authors of this st udy would recommend a sand soil for use as 
a CW wetland substrate in southern Quebec as  there is less P to lose from the soil 
if redox conditions are low enough to re duce iron and there is more water 
movement within the soil column. While th e more prolific plant growth in the 
field soil tanks translates into a larger  uptake of nutrients, once the tanks of both 
soil types are fully colonized the rapid uptake of nutrients will cease and no 
longer be an advantage of the field soil.  
 
(4) This study demonstrated that field soil is better at promoting denitrification than 
sand soil that is planted with  cattails and reed canary grass and with an average 
hydraulic retention time of 2.2 days when  flooded with simulation agricultural 
runoff typical in Quebec. 
 
(5) The field soil tanks outperformed the sa ndy soil tanks with an overall removal of 
63% TDN, compared to 41% TDN removal.  It was likely due to the richer soil 
having been able to support a larger vegetation biomass which was in turn 
responsible for greater nutrient assim ilation, the higher OM accretion rate and 
greater available carbon for suppor ting larger microbial populations. 
 
(6) As demonstrated by the dissolved oxygen and oxidation reduction potential within 
the tanks, the water column conditions were anaerobic after the first month of operation. Denitrification was also appare nt in the observatio n of nitrous oxide 
emissions coming from both soil types. While there was no significant difference 
in emission rates between the two soil types, it was likely that more N
2O was 
being further reduced to N 2 in the field soil tanks, due to the higher carbon 
availability. 
 
(7) Nitrogen transformations occurred in both soil types; NH 4+ was produced in the 
sand soil tanks and the outflow contained 14%  more than the inflow. In contrast 
the field soil tanks removed 28% of the inflowing NH 4+ probably due to the  102higher root-rhizome density and corre sponding aerobic microzones where NH 4+ 
would have been reduced to NO 3. Dissolved organic nitrogen was also produced 
in both tanks with 20% more in the outlet from the sand than field soil tanks. This 
may have been caused by the more severe ly reduced conditions in the field soil 
tanks under which OM accumulates more quickly thus sequestering DON.  
  1036. Chapter 6- Recommendations for further study 
 
Following are five recommendations for further study at the Macdonald campus 
surface-flow constructed wetland for the trea tment of agricultural runoff in Quebec:  
a. One of the limitations to this study was that it did not address how this 
constructed wetland design would impact pa rticulate P which is often present in 
runoff events such as the spring snow me lt. Further study of the capacity of this 
design to reduce particulate P from agricu ltural runoff would be interesting as the 
deep zone combined with a slow inflow rate should, in theory, allow for 
particulate settling.  
 
b. With an overall P removal of approximately 40%, the design of the vegetated tanks used in this research project could be improved in an effort to increase the 
removal efficiency. A mixing device could be placed in the deep zone to aerate 
the water column and help increase the oxidation-reduction cond itions to a level 
where Fe
3+ is no longer reduced, allowing it to react with and immobilize 
dissolved P. In addition to improvi ng the redox conditions, increasing the 
hydraulic retention time would allow more treatment w ithin the CW.  
 
c. Future work at this sight should include further testing for iron as well as plant 
tissue analysis. Outlet water sample analysis for soluble Fe2+ concentration as 
well as soil sample analysis for Fe concentration would confirm that the P loss 
from the soil was indeed coupled with the reduction of insoluble Fe3+ to soluble 
Fe2+. Plant analysis for P would complete the P mass balance and confirm that the 
P released from the soil was i ndeed taken up by the vegetation. 
 
d. DOC concentration increased in the outle t from both soil types in September, 
2007. As well as being an indication of car bon loading within both systems, it is 
an indication of potential BOD 5 being produced. It would be pertinent to monitor 
this in future studies of this site.  
  104e. Denitrification occurs more readily under anaerobic condi tions, and phosphorus 
adsorption and precipitation occur more  readily under aerobic conditions; 
therefore, further research into creati ng constructed wetlands that contain both 
types of conditions would potentially ma ximize the retention of both nutrients. 
Linking two of the vegetated tanks in seri es, with one being aerated and one not, 
may be an interesting study in the future.  
 
f. Surface-flow constructed wetlands are most often used in the treatment of 
agricultural runoff because they are less prone to clogging when the runoff 
contains particulate matter. Despite th is, it may be interesting to study a sub-
surface flow wetland model because it forces  the water through the soil column, 
providing more opportunity for soil-ion interactions. If this design were 
incorporated with a pond to settle out particulate matter,  it may increase dissolved 
P removal efficiency as compar ed to our surface-flow model.
