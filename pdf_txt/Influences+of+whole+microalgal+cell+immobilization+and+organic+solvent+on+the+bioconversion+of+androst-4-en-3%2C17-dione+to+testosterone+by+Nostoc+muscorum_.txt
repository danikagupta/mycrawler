The use of free, immobilized and reused immobilized cells of the microalga Nostoc muscorum was stud-
ied for bioconversion of androst-4-en-3,17-dione (AD) to testosterone in hexadecane. Among polymerssuch as agar, agarose, /H9260-carrageenan, polyacrylamide, polyvinyl alcohol, and sodium alginate that were
examined for cell entrapment, sodium alginate with a concentration of 2% (w/v) proved to be the propermatrix for N. muscorum cells immobilization. The bioconversion characteristics of immobilized whole
algal cells at ranges of temperatures, substrate concentrations, and shaking speeds were studied followedby a comparison with those of free cells. The conditions were 30
◦C, 0.5 g/L, and 100 rpm, respectively.
The immobilized N. muscorum showed higher yield (72 ±2.3%) than the free form (24 ±1.3%) at the
mentioned conditions. The bioconversion yield did not decrease during reuse of immobilized cells andremained high even after 5 batches of bioreactions while Na-alginate 3% was used; however, reuse ofalginate 2% beads did not give a satisfactory result.

1. Introduction
Whole cell biocatalyst activity and stability during biocon-
version reactions may be inﬂuenced by parameters such astemperature, shaking speed, and substrate concentration [1], which
can be reduced with cell immobilization techniques. The mainadvantages claimed for applying immobilized whole cells includethe higher reaction rates due to increased cell densities, possibil-ities for regenerating the biocatalytic activity, ability to conductcontinuous operations at a high dilution rate without washout, eas-ier control of the fermentation process, long-term stabilization ofcell activity, reusability of the biocatalyst, and higher speciﬁc yields[2–5] . The combination of cell immobilization methods and organic
solvent systems in biotransformation processes decreases the dif-ﬁculties of the low solubility of high concentrations of lipophilicprecursors and products, and provides environmental protectionfor biocatalysts [6].
The use of immobilized cells for bioconversion of steroids in
organic media is a valuable method to increase the solubility ofpoor water-soluble steroid compounds. However, the critical point

the cell membrane, denaturation of membrane-bound enzymes,and cytolysis [4,5] . Although much work has been reported on the
utilization of immobilized bacteria and fungi in organic media forthe conversion of organic compounds [1,7,8] , no data are available
for the application of both techniques for the biotransformation ofsteroids by microalgae [9].
The use of algal biotechnology has received considerable atten-
tion in recent decades. These photosynthetic organisms have beenused in food, cosmetics, aquaculture, and pharmaceutical indus-tries [10] . However, the small size of microalgal cells implies a
problem in the application of biotechnology processes to thoseorganisms. Microalgal cell immobilization has been developed tosolve the mentioned difﬁculties.
In the this study, we applied immobilized microalga Nostoc mus-
corum for biotransformation of androst-4-en-3,17-dione (AD) to
testosterone in an organic medium. In our previous study, vari-ous organic solvents were examined to ﬁnd out the proper organicmedia that caused no toxicity effect on N. muscorum cells [11] .
Hexadecane and tetradecane proved to increase the solubility ofthe lipophilic steroid substrate and enhanced enzyme activity. Tomask the inhibition effects of the solvent and substrate toxicity andprovide the possibility of reusing the algal cells, we tried to immo-bilize N. muscorum by entrapment methods in different matrices.
Appropriate bioreaction conditions such as temperature, agitationrate, and substrate concentration were also studied to maximizethe bioconversion yield.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemicals and instruments
Androst-4-en-3,17-dione (AD) and /H9260-carrageenan were pur-
chased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Agar, agarose,polyvinyl alcohol, and polyacrylamide were obtained from Merck(Darmstadt, Germany). Sodium alginate was supplied by B.D.H.Chemical Ltd. (Poole, England). All other reagents and solvents wereof the highest purity grade available (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany)unless otherwise mentioned.
The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) apparatus
consisted of a Jasco model PU-986 pump, a UV-1570 UV variable-wavelength detector, and an online degasser, all from Jasco (Tokyo,Japan). Samples were injected in a Jasco AS-950 injector systemwith an auto-injector. The data were acquired and processed withBorwin chromatography software (version 1.5) from Jasco (Tokyo,Japan). Chromatographic separation was achieved on a Finepack SILC18 reverse-phase column (C18, 15 cm ×0.46 cm i.d., 5- /H9262m particle
size) from Teknokroma (Barcelona, Spain).
2.2. Algal strain and incubation condition
An axenic culture of N. muscorum [12,13] was grown in BG-
11 medium [10] and maintained at 4
◦C on BG-11 agar slants.
The BG-11 medium contained (g/L) NaNO 3, 1.5; K 2HPO 4, 0.04;
MgSO 4·7H 2O, 0.075; CaCl 2·2H 2O, 0.036; ferric ammonium cit-
rate, 0.006; citric acid, 0.006; Na 2EDTA, 0.001; Na 2CO 3, 0.02;
trace element solution, 1 mL; distilled water up to 1000 mL. Thetrace element solution contained (g/L) H
3BO 3, 2.86; MnCl 2·4H 2O,
1.81; ZnSO 4·7H 2O, 0.222; Na 2MoO 4·2H 2O, 0.3; CuSO 4·5H 2O, 0.079;
Co(NO 3)2·6H 2O, 0.494; distilled water up to 1000 mL.
The alga was transferred to fresh medium every two months. To
prepare adequate cell mass, N. muscorum was inoculated into two
500-mL Erlenmeyer ﬂasks, each containing 100 mL of BG-11 liquidmedium (pH 7.0), and incubated at 25
◦C under continuous illumi-
nation from all sides at an irradiance of 60 /H9262mol photons/m2s1
with cool-white ﬂuorescent lamps. Cells were harvested in the
late exponential phase and centrifuged at 2.0 ×103gfor 5 min.
Each 5-mL packed wet cell volume [14] , which is equal to 100 mg
dry cell weight, was used to inoculate a 100-mL Erlenmeyer ﬂaskcontaining 20 mL of organic solvent. The control aqueous biotrans-formation medium was prepared using the same procedure exceptthat the organic system was replaced by 20 mL of BG-11 medium.
The viability of algal cells in the presence of hexadecane was
proved by the cells appearance and re-culturing in fresh BG-11medium. The optimum reaction temperature and substrate con-centration were 30
◦C and 0.5 mg/L, respectively.
2.3. Immobilization technique
According to a recent study [11] , hexadecane with log poctanol
8.2 is the proper organic medium for biotransformation of AD to
its single reductive derivative by the alga N. muscorum . Therefore,
the following immobilization experiments in the selected matriceswere carried out in hexadecane under the conditions mentionedabove (see Section 2.2). In all experiments, free whole cells of N.
muscorum were used as control. Before each immobilization exper-
iment, algal cells were harvested in the late exponential phase,centrifuged at 2.0 ×10
3gfor 5 min and provided a 5-mL packed
wet cell volume.
2.3.1. Cell entrapment in agar and agarose
The reaction mixtures were separately prepared by dissolving
agar or agarose (2%, w/v) in distilled water at 100◦C, and then
cooled at 40◦C and mixed with an equal volume of packed algalcell volume. The mixtures were placed in Petri dishes and allowed
to solidify by standing at 4◦C. Hard gels were cut into small pieces
and entrapped cells removed by washing with distilled water [15] .
2.3.2. Alga entrapment in /DC4-carrageenan
A deﬁned portion of N. muscorum cells was mixed with the same
volume of /H9260-carrageenan solution (2%, w/v). The resulting mixture
was pumped through a needle (30-mL syringe, ﬁtted with a wide-bore needle approximately 2 mm diameter for droplet formation)into a 2% (w/v) potassium chloride solution. The formed beads con-taining algal cells were gently mixed with a magnetic stirring barfor 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed with distilledwater before use [16] .
2.3.3. Acrylamide entrapment
N. muscorum cells (200-mg wet weight equal to double the
packed cell volume) were added to 6 mL of Tris–HCl buffer, pH7.8, containing 105 mg of acrylamide and 3 mg of bis-acrylamide.The mixture was added drop by drop using the needle men-tioned before into 100 mL of mineral oil containing 84 mg ofammonium persulfate and 84 /H9262L of tetramethylethylenediamine
(TEMED). Polymerization was performed at room temperature for24 h. The formed beads were washed with sterile water to removeundesired residue [17] .
2.3.4. Sodium alginate immobilization
Algal cells were mixed homogenously with the same volume of
sodium alginate solution (2%, w/v). The mixture was added into0.2 M of cold calcium chloride solution by a syringe and left toharden for 1 h. The alginate beads were washed with distilled waterbefore use [3].
2.3.5. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) immobilization
The reaction mixture was prepared by dissolving PVA (15%, w/v)
in distilled water at 100
◦C. After cooling down to 30–40◦C, one
portion of PVA aqueous solution was mixed with an equal volumeof packed algal cells. The resulting mixture was put drop wise intothe saturated boric acid solution through a needle and gently stirredfor 1 h to form spherical beads. The PVA beads were screened witha mesh, and then rinsed with tap water to remove the residualboric acid. The formed gel beads were transferred to a 1-M sodiumphosphate solution pH 7 for 30 min to harden. The phosphorylatedbeads were separated by ﬁltration and rinsed with distilled water[18] .
2.4. Bioconversion
The prepared beads of the immobilized algal cells were sep-
arately suspended in 100-mL Erlenmeyer ﬂasks; each containing20 mL of BG-11 medium for the aqueous system and 20 mL of hex-adecane for the organic mono-phase system. A deﬁned amount ofAD, 10 mg, dissolved in 100 /H9262L of chloroform was added to each
ﬂask. Free whole cells of N. muscorum were used as control. The
ﬂasks were incubated on a rotary shaker at 30
◦C with a shaking
speed of 100 rpm. After 5 days, the samples were taken followedby AD and testosterone analysis by HPLC. To validate the repro-ducibility of the data, each bioconversion run was carried out intriplicate using different batches.
2.5. Quantitative analyses
HPLC was applied for quantitative studies to obtain bioconver-
sion yield in aqueous and organic systems as well as time coursestudy, inﬂuence of temperature, substrate concentration, and shak-ing speed. In this order, each 100 /H9262L of samples was diluted with
400/H9262L of acetonitrile (ACN). A total of 10 /H9262L was injected intoDownload English Version:
