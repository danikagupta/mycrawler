Abstract
Spawning, larval and juvenile rearing of the tropical abalone Haliotis varia L. were studied.
Brood stock abalone were induced to spawn by exposure to air for 2 h at 27 jC. Female abalone
spawned a mean of 76,530 eggs. Fertilised eggs measured 180 Am in diameter. Seventy percent
survival was obtained during larval rearing. Larvae passed trochophore, veliger, gliding and creeping
stages and were induced to settle on a mat of diatoms containing Nitszchia sp. and Navicula sp. The
larval rearing period of H. varia ranged from 4 to 6 days at 27 jC. The settled spat vigorously fed on
the diatom mat until the 50th day of postfertilisation and coralline red algal film, until the 70th day of
postfertilisation. First respiratory pore was formed on the 27th day of postfertilisation. Juvenileabalones were reared on three algal diets such as coralline red algae, green filamentous algae and
Ulva lactuca from the 71st to 200th day of postfertilisation. Those fed with coralline algae showed
best and consistent growth. Shell colour of juveniles was affected by diet. The present study on theproduction of juveniles in the hatchery is a baseline information to initiate abalone aquaculture inIndia and to help augment the natural population.

1). The distribution of H. varia in the country is restricted to the Pamban and
Tuticorin areas along the Gulf of Mannar and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.Abalone does not support any commercial fishery in India because of its limiteddistribution and small size. Pioneering attempts have been made in recent years tostudy the larval rearing and reproduction in H. varia (Najmudeen et al., 2000;
Najmudeen, 2001; Najmudeen and Victor, 2003) .
Most of the other commercially important species of abalone have been success-
fully cultured and their ‘larval development’, documented (Ino, 1952; Leighton, 1972) .
Extensive literature are available on the spawning and larval rearing of the temperatespecies of abalone in the last two decades (Du and Guo, 1981; Tong, 1982; Baudry,
1982; Nie et al., 1984; Pena, 1984; Ebert and Houk, 1984; Tong et al., 1987; Genadeet al., 1988; Iang et al., 1992) . Although there is a high demand for cocktail-size
tropical abalones in the international market (Chen, 1989) , intensive efforts for their
propagation have been initiated only recently (Jarayabhand et al., 1995; Capinpin and
Hosoya, 1995; Jarayabhand and Paphavasit, 1996) . No successful rearing of H. varia
has been reported to date.
Abalone larvae depend on recognition of external chemical signals from the
environment for settlement and metamorphosis (Morse et al., 1979; Morse and Morse,
1984) . Substances such as g-amino butyric acid (GABA; Morse, 1990 ), biotic films
derived from seawater or mucus trails of grazing adult are used to induce metamor-phosis (Seki and Kan-no, 1981; Toole, 1988; Hahn, 1989) . As benthic diatoms form
principal food source of postlarval abalone (Kawamura, 1996) , maintaining a suitable
diatom film is a critical factor in the success of abalone hatcheries worldwide.
Because abalone occupies a significant position in the world aquaculture scenario,
it is imperative to develop its culture techniques in India with the native species. The
Fig. 1. Adult H. varia collected from the Gulf of Mannar.T.M. Najmudeen, A.C.C. Victor / Aquaculture 234 (2004) 277–292 278restricted and moderate distribution of this species in the country necessitates its
production through aquaculture. Because the standardisation of seed production is thefirst step in attempting culture of a new species, the present investigation hasfocussed on the spawning, larval development and juvenile rearing of H. varia under
controlled and semicontrolled conditions.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Brood stock maintenance
Mature live specimens of H. varia of more than 25 mm in shell length were
collected from the intertidal rocks of the Tuticorin Harbour basin, 2–3 days prior tofull moon and new moon days. Care was taken not to damage the foot whiledislodging them from the substratum with the aid of a wooden chisel. These werethen transported to the Mandapam Regional Centre Laboratory of the Central Marine
Fisheries Research Institute, by placing them on a round perforated asbestos sheet in a
bucket with a wet piece of mat made up of jute fibres. The transportation time was6–8 h and they were kept moist by sprinkling seawater at frequent intervals.Transported abalones were stocked in 1.5-tonne capacity FRP tanks filled with clean,filtered seawater (FSW). The FSW was obtained by filtering the seawater through amechanical filter made of coarse and fine sand, charcoal and cotton. Feeding was donetwice a week with thin pieces of freshly collected seaweed Ulva lactuca. Abalones
were fed at a rate of 10% of the body weight after removing the leftover feeds from
the tank.
2.2. Spawning inducement and fertilisation
Induced spawning was attempted in abalone by the desiccation method described
byCarlisle (1945) . Ripe male and female abalone were exposed to air for 2 h and
then transferred at a ratio of 1 male:1 female to a plastic basin containing 30 l ofFSW of 32 F2 ppt salinity. Three spawning trials were conducted by placing six
abalones in each container. Spawning occurred at late night or early morning hours
when water temperature was about 25 F2jC.
After the gametes were completely extruded from the gonad, the spawning
containers were left undisturbed for 1 h to facilitate fertilisation. As the fertilisedeggs settled at the bottom of the container, they were collected by siphoning out thebottom water through a 50- Am sieve, followed by repeated washing with FSW to
remove excess sperm. Fertilisation percentage in each trial was estimated by aliquotsampling (Ebert and Houk, 1984) .
2.3. Hatching and larval rearing
Fertilised ova developed to the early veliger stage in the hatching container and
congregated at the water surface. About two-thirds of the surface water of theT.M. Najmudeen, A.C.C. Victor / Aquaculture 234 (2004) 277–292 279hatching container was siphoned out to another container with 20 l of FSW, while
the rest of the water containing discharged egg membranes, faeces of adult abaloneand unhatched eggs were discarded. For estimating larval density, uniform distribu-tion was obtained by stirring with a glass pipette. Aliquot samples were taken andcounted under a light microscope.
During larval development, water flow and aeration were stopped. Daily water
exchange was done with FSW after siphoning the larvae on to a 50- Am net.
Larval development stages were recorded twice daily by microscopic examination,
and different stages were photographed using a binocular compound microscopewith a camera unit. To assess the growth of the larvae, the length of 40 larvae inthe samples from each trial was measured under an ocular micrometer calibratedagainst a stage micrometer, in alternate days. The hydrographic parameters, such assalinity, water temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen of the rearing container, wererecorded daily using standard seawater analysis procedures (Strickland and Parsons,
1968) .
2.4. Induced settlement and metamorphosis
On day 4, the free-swimming larvae were transferred to 20-l capacity settling
containers having a thin, uniform layer of benthic diatoms. The settling containerswere placed without aeration in a greenhouse with translucent plastic roofing. Waterexchange was done twice daily after filtering the larvae through a 100- Am mesh
sieve.
After the settlement of the creeping larvae, they were thinned and introduced to
other 20-l capacity containers for metamorphosis. The settled spat were carefullyremoved from the settling container by using a thin paintbrush without anaesthetisingthem. The containers were covered 6 h a day with dark cotton cloth to regulatediatom growth. The percentage success of metamorphosis was estimated by countingthe number of peristomeal shell stage abalones from the samples at regular intervalsunder a compound microscope.
2.5. Juvenile rearing
The metamorphosed spat were retained in the settling containers until they reached
the juvenile stage with 1–2 respiratory pores. They were reared until 50 dayspostfertilisation on diatom feed. From the 50th to 70th day of postfertilisation, theywere fed with thin films of coralline red algae attached to the coralline stones, whichwere collected from the natural habitat of adult abalone. On the 71st day ofpostfertilisation, juveniles were transferred to juvenile culture tanks with a 20-
l capacity. Three rearing trials were conducted using different types of supplementary
feed such as fresh, thin pieces of Ulva lactuca , coralline red algae and green
filamentous algae in separate containers. Feeds were provided at weekly intervals.Water exchange was done every 3 days with FSW. Juvenile growth, length and widthof 30 abalones from each trial, was measured weekly to the nearest millimeter.Juveniles were reared up to 200 days postfertilisation.T.M. Najmudeen, A.C.C. Victor / Aquaculture 234 (2004) 277–292 2802.6. Diatom culture
Culture of diatoms for the postlarval stage abalone commenced prior to larval
settlement. Benthic diatoms, such as Nitzschia sp. and Navicula sp., scraped from the
inner walls of the containers used to store seawater, were used as inoculum. Twentylitres of seawater in the larval rearing and settling containers enriched with Walne’s
(1974) algal culture medium was inoculated with diatom and kept in diffused sunlight
without aeration. After 3–4 days, a uniform layer of diatoms was formed along thewalls of the container. To keep the diatoms healthy, a water exchange was done onalternate days. Diatom subcultures were established regularly in order to transfer thepostlarvae to new and healthy cultures at weekly intervals.

ered significant at P< 0.05.

Abalones spawned at late night or early morning hours, when the temperature was
around 25 jC. The desiccation method was successful when the animals were fully

triggered females to spawn. Partial spawning was observed in some specimens, which
were used for another spawning trial. Ejaculation of gametes was mainly through thelast four respiratory pores. Sperm stayed in suspension.
The average number of eggs spawned was 76,530 per female with a maximum of
215,200 at a shell length of 48.23 mm. Eggs were fertilised within 1 h of spawning.Fertilised eggs were 180 Am in diameter and spherical in shape (Fig. 2) . They
immediately absorbed water and sank to the bottom. Excess sperm were founddetrimental to hatching success. The average fertilisation rate was 50%.

The two-cell stage was reached within 2 h at 27 jC. Trochophore stage larvae were
obtained at about 10 h postfertilisation (Fig. 3) and hatching commenced at 12 h. The
average hatching rate was 70%. The larvae began to rotate vigorously within the
membrane, which resulted in the bursting of the membrane (Fig. 4) . Free-swimming
trochophore larvae were positively phototactic and had a tendency to gather at theculture surface. They measured about 190 Am in diameter. The trochophore stage
extended for 10–12 h at 27 jC. At about 24 h postfertilisation, the early veliger stage
ensued. The apical region of larvae became flat and the velum was completelydeveloped with long cilia (Fig. 5) . Larval shell covered the body just below the
velum, and measured 210 F12Am in length. In the late veliger larvae, the foot mass
protrudes to the top of the shell and the larval shell is completely developed (Fig. 6) .
This stage extended to 3 days postfertilisation. On day 4, veliger larvae began to settle
on the walls of the container but remained quite motile. The cephalic tentacles hadfour branches and well-developed eyespots (Fig. 7) . Larvae could pull upright with
their foot and also propel by ciliary action. This stage is found to be optimal fortransferring to settling containers. Larvae actively crawled with their foot, but did notTable 1

was fully obtained when the cilia were expelled and the abalones were dependent onbenthic diatoms. Creeping larvae measured 260 F12Am in length. The larval rearing
period of H. varia ranged from 4 to 9 days at a water temperature of 27 jC. No
significant difference ( P>0.05) could be recorded in the water quality parameters
between the three trials. The salinity for the larval rearing was 33 F2 ppt and the pH
was 8.3 F3. The dissolved oxygen in the rearing containers was 5.01 F0.63 mg/l.

H. varia .
3.3. Larval settlement and metamorphosis
The majority of larvae ceased swimming and settled on the diatom film on the container
walls. No settlement was observed on the bottom. After settlement, larvae never detachedfrom the diatom surface. Complete settlement occurred at 7 days postfertilisation at 27 jC.
These abalones measured 288 /C2218Am(Fig. 8) .
Peristomeal shell growth was first observed at 6 days postfertilisation resulting in the
transformation of ovoid larval shell to the flat abalone shell form (Fig. 9) . It was observed
that the juvenile abalone actively fed on the diatom mat using their muscular foot. Shellgrowth was initially slow, but increased progressively (Fig. 10) . On day 15, a violet shell
colouration commenced and the juvenile abalone measured 820 /C2670Am. The first
respiratory pore was formed at the anterior end of the shell at a length of 2.2 mm at 26 days

length of 2.6 mm at 46 days postfertilisation (Fig. 11) .
3.4. Diatom culture
A uniform thin layer of diatoms on the walls of the containers could be obtained after 4
days of culture. Fresh cultures could be initiated and sustained using the seawater from this
container as inoculum. Overgrowth of green filamentous algae on the walls of the
container was observed on exposure to sunlight for a long period.
3.5. Juvenile rearing
Supplemental feeding with fresh algae enhanced growth rates. Significant differ-
ences in growth rate were obtained between trials ( P< 0.05). Average daily growth
was higher for those fed with U. lactuca for the initial 35 days of culture. Survival
rate was also higher in this trial (Table 2) . After 200 days of rearing, mean shell
lengths were 8.76 and 11.32 mm, respectively, for juveniles fed with U. lactuca and
coralline red algae (Fig. 12) . Those fed with filamentous algae exhibited a poor
growth rate of 29.15 Am day/C01during initial culture period (Table 3) , but the growthFig. 12. Mean shell length (mm) of H. varia juveniles fed with three different diets ( n=3 0/C23).

had developed green and white colouration, whereas those fed with coralline red algaehad reddish brown colour on their shells.
4. Discussion
In spite of the availability of rich marine fauna for mariculture, the coastal/marine
aquaculture in India is dominated by shrimp culture. Although shrimp culturecontinues as a lucrative industry, recent setbacks attributed to the spread of whitespot disease necessitated the development of alternative farming/mariculutre technol-ogies and candidate species that could promise comparable profits to shrimp farming.Molluscan aquaculture is emerging in India as one of the viable alternatives to thecontinuously failing shrimp culture (Devaraj and Appukuttan, 2000) . Aquaculture
production of highly valuable abalone will enable us to place this species as a
commodity in India’s export basket, thereby increasing foreign exchange earnings.
Once the seed production technique is standardised, the culture and pearl productionin this species can be attempted in the country.
The results of the present experiment on the seed production of H. varia reveal that
the larval production and rearing of this species are more or less similar to and within thetime confines of other commercially important Haliotis species (Ebert and Houk, 1984;
Genade et al., 1988; Capinpin and Hosoya, 1995) . The spat of this species can be
produced in a commercial scale, if the necessary requirements are provided. Breeding
period of H. varia at Tuticorin extends from December to March (Najmudeen, 2001) .
Fully ripe abalones were only obtained 1 or 2 days before new moon or full moon days,and subsequent to this, most animals were in spent or partially spawned stage indicatingmass spawning during this period in the natural habitat. Lunar periodicity has beenreported in the top shell Trochus niloliticus byHahn (1989) .
Abalones with more advanced gonads were induced to spawn by desiccation method
during natural spawning period. Two hours exposure to air resulted to massive spawning.When the animals were exposed to air immediately after transportation, high mortality
due to stress was noted. The routine methods of spawning inducement, such as using
hydrogen peroxide (Morse et al., 1979; Morse, 1984; Hooker and Morse, 1985) and UV
irradiation (Kikuchi and Uki, 1974) , were not tried in H. varia due to the success of the
desiccation method. As reported in the tropical abalone Haliotis asinina (Capinpin and
Hosoya, 1995) ,H. varia mostly spawned during evening or night hours, probably due to
the lower temperature.
Male and female abalones were placed in the same container and the eggs were
fertilised consequent to spawning. In most hatcheries, male and female abalones have
been kept separately for spawning. Fertilisation was accomplished by mixing eggs and
sperm (Kikuchi and Uki, 1974) . However, Capinpin and Hosoya (1995) obtained good
fertilisation rate following the technique used in the present study. The disadvantage ofthis method is the loss of control over the fertilisation process (Hahn, 1989) . Fertilised
eggs of H. varia are smaller (180 Am) compared to that of Haliotis iris (230Am;
Harrison and Grant, 1971 ) and Haliotis midae (222Am;Genade et al., 1988 ).T.M. Najmudeen, A.C.C. Victor / Aquaculture 234 (2004) 277–292 288Collection of ova from the spawning container and transfer of veligers to larval rearing
containers are vital procedures during the hatchery phase as they can result in larvalcontamination. When eggs were kept in the spawning container for more than 1h postspawning, the hatching rate was adversely affected. The same result was noticedbyEbert and Houk (1984) inHaliotis rufescens .
Trochophore and early veliger larvae of H. varia are phototactic as described in other
haliotids by Koike (1978) ,Ebert and Houk (1984) andPena (1986) . Our larval rearing
period ranged from 4 to 6 days at 27 jC. The inverse relationship between the rearing
period and water temperature has been reported (Ebert and Houk, 1984; Pena, 1986) . The
larvae of H. varia are lecithotropic as other abalone larvae.
One of the critical stages in the life history of invertebrate larvae occurs during the
termination of planktonic stage (Slattery, 1992; Takahashi et al., 2002) .I n H. varia ,
complete larval settlement was achieved within the 7th day of postfertilisation at 27 jC.
Larval settlement of Haliotis coccinea canariensis was in the 8th day of postfertilisation at
15jC(Pena, 1975) .I nHaliotis discus hannai , the settlement process was initiated 6–7
days postfertilisation at 20 jC(Takami et al., 1997) . Larvae periodically attached their foot
to the walls of the container and crawled. Induced settlement and metamorphosis using a
mat of diatoms were achieved in H. discus hannai (Seki and Kan-no, 1981) and H.
rufescens (Slattery, 1992) .Bryan and Qian (1998) reported that veliger larvae of Haliotis
diversicolor were attached on diatom films, which was stimulated by certain species of
bacteria within the films.
In their natural environment, abalone larvae settle exclusively on crustose red algae
(Morse and Morse, 1984; Shepherd and Tumer, 1985) . Spats of H. varia are seen on the
rocks or coral pieces with coralline red algae. Morse et al. (1980) reported that GABA-
mimetic polypeptides sequestered from crustose red algae could be used as settlement-
inducing agents. No such chemical inducers were used in the present study. However, itwas important to provide continuous supply of fresh diatom films for the settled andmetamorphosed spats. Previous studies have suggested that the larvae are merelynarcotised by compounds from diatom films or mucus trails of adults (Akashige et al.,
1981) , but the settlement observed mostly on the walls of the container in the present
study clearly rules out this conclusion. As grazing by juveniles was vigorous, the diatommat was cleaned up within short periods. Alternate exposure of the containers to sunlight
helped maintain good diatom film.
The growth and survival of postlarvae are affected by the ingestibility and
digestibility of the diatom which, in turn, depends on the species dominated in thebiofilm (Roberts et al., 1999) . Survival rates during the postsettlement period were
generally low and variable (Searcy-Bernal et al., 1992) . However, our experiments
recorded about 70% survival through 50 days of rearing on the diatoms Nitzschia sp.
and Navicula sp. Further detailed study is required on the ingestion efficiency of
these diatoms for enhancing growth rate of postlarval H. varia .Takami et al. (1997)
have reported that postlarval H. discus hannai reared on a diatom film containing
Cocconeis scutellum var. parva grew for approximately 1 week, but were not able to
grow after that and died before the end of 2 weeks. Roberts et al. (1999) reported
that young postlarvae of H. asinina have high digestive efficiencies for two types of
Navicula spp.T.M. Najmudeen, A.C.C. Victor / Aquaculture 234 (2004) 277–292 289Growth of juvenile abalone was enhanced at elevated temperatures. The fully formed
first respiratory pore was observed within 27 days postfertilisation at 27 jC. It was 8 weeks
inH. rufescens at 15jC(Ebert and Houk, 1984) and 43 days in H. midae (Genade et al.,
1988) . Juveniles fed with crustose red algae had faster growth than those fed with the other
two feeds. The major food of adult and juvenile H. varia is the coralline algae attached to
coral stones. However, the average daily growth of H. asinina fed with Gracilariopsis
heteroclada was two times higher than that obtained in the present study with coralline red
algae (SEAFDEC, 1997) . Juvenile shell colour is affected by the food consumed. Similar
dietary pigmentation was observed in H. midae byGenade et al. (1988) . This property can
be utilised to produce quality abalone pearls by altering the iridescence of the shell interior.
The major advantage in the seed production of abalone is the nonrequirement of
supplementary feeding during the larval rearing period, unlike many bivalve specieswhich require suitable algal feed. The larval rearing period of H. varia is 4–6 days,
which reduces the possible risks associated with long periods of larval rearing. All ofthe other procedures are similar to the hatchery techniques of most of the other
commercially important species of abalone. Findings of the present study are signif-
icant, as this would give insight in the production of abalone using only the naturallyavailable diatom species for settlement and metamorphosis instead of expensivechemicals like GABA. The application of various strategies for induced maturation,spawning and settlement in H. varia would require further research to bring these
process under complete control. The present study on the production of juveniles of H.
varia in the hatchery may open up new avenues in the field of abalone culture and
pearl production in India. Mass production of juveniles and ranching them on intertidal
rocky coasts can further augment the natural population.
