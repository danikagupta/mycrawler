1. ABSTRACT 
 
Approximately 0.7 million tons of azo dyes are 
synthesized each year.  Azo dyes are composed of one or 
more R 1-N=N-R 2 linkages.  Studies have shown that both 
mammalian and microbial azoreductases cleave the azo 
bonds of the dyes to form co mpounds that are potentially 
genotoxic.  The human gastro intestinal tract harbors a 
diverse microbiota comprised of at least several thousand 
species.  Both water-soluble and water-insoluble azo dyes 
can be reduced by intestinal bacteria.  Some of the 
metabolites produced by intestinal microbiota have been 
shown to be carcinogenic to humans although the parent 
azo dyes may not be classified as being carcinogenic.  
Azoreductase activity is co mmonly found in intestinal 
bacteria.  Three types of azoreductases have been 
characterized in bacteria.  They are flavin dependent 
NADH preferred azoreductase, flavin dependent NADPH 
preferred azoreductase, and flavin free NADPH preferred 
azoreductase.  This review highlights how azo dyes are 
metabolized by intestinal bacteria, mechanisms of azo 
reduction, and the potential contribution in the 
carcinogenesis/mutagenesis of the reduction of the azo dyes 
by intestinal microbiota.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
2. INTRODUCTION 
 
One of the remarkable abilities of the human eye 
is to recognize colors; ther efore compounds like dyes are 
used to enhance the attractiveness of objects.  Today, there 
are thousands of various types of dyes used widely in foods, 
pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, textiles and plastics (36, 90, 
128), some of which may pose a risk to human and 
ecological health due to their toxic properties.  Dyes have 
been used for thousands of years and approximately 0.7 
million tons of dyes are synthesized annually worldwide 
(41, 110).  Azo dyes are a group of compounds containing 
one or more R
1-N=N-R 2 bonds, some of the reduced 
products of the dyes are carcinogenic (59).  Azo dyes 
represent the majority of all the dyes used in today’s 
society, because the azo bond facilitates π-electron 
delocalization, which gives rise  to the absorption at visible 
spectrum wavelengths (78).   
 
Microorganisms have evol ved in a long-lasting 
mutual interactions with hum an beings to influence host 
physiology (67).  Although the study of intestinal bacteria 
was hindered by the fact that most of the bacteria were 
unculturable ex vivo  (67), recent molecular and genomic 
sequencing approaches have revealed a vast and dynamic Toxicity of azo dye reduction by intestinal microbiota

consortium of bacteria, with  an estimated 100 trillion 
bacteria inhabiting in  the human gut (68).  The function of 
intestinal bacteria includ es enhancing host digestive 
efficiency, providing instructive signals for several aspects 
of intestinal development, and protecting their hosts against 
pathogenic infections (68).  As a result of enhancing host 
digestive efficiency , germ-free rodents must consume about 
30% more calories to sustain their body weight than that of 
conventionally raised animals (6 ).  The relationship of host 
immune system and the intestinal microbiota has been 
reviewed recently (68).  Colonization barrier disruption of the intestinal bacteria has been linked to several types of 
diseases to the host.  For example, inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD) was associated with activating 
inappropriately the host mucosa l immune system by losing 
of tolerance to gut commensals (51, 82).  
 
Human intestinal bacteria also play a role in 
degrading various xenobiotics to metabolites, some of 
which are involved in genotox icity and carcinogenesis.  
Human exposure to xenobiotics including azo dyes occurs 
via ingestion, skin c ontact, or inhalation.  Azo dyes can be 
biotransformed into colorless aromatic amines, some of 
these may become less toxic than the original dye, but 
others, such as arylamines and free radicals, are potentially 
carcinogenic (40).  Sudan azo dyes  such as Sudan I, II, III, 
IV and Para Red are often illegally used to enhance and/or 
maintain the appearance of food products and they have 
been found as food contaminants (28, 138).  The initial step 
in the anaerobic metabolism of azo dyes by intestinal 
microbiota is reduction of the azo bond by the NAD(P)H 
dependent azoreductases.  Three distinct groups of 
azoreductases have been found, flavin dependent NADH 
preferred azoreductase, flav in dependent NADPH preferred 
azoreductase, a nd flavin free NADPH preferred 
azoreductase (3 1, 87).  The flavin dependent NADH 
preferred azoreductase has been purified from Escherichia 
coli (95), Enterococcus faecalis (33), and Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa (134).  The flavin de pendent NADPH preferred 
azoreductase has been purified from Bacillus cereus OY1-2 
(129), and similar genes were found from Rhodobacter 
sphaaeroides (16),  Staphylococcus aureus (32),  and 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (80).  The flavin free NADPH 
preferred azoreductase has been purified from Xenophilus 
azovorans KF46F (18) and Pigmentiphaga kullae K24 (19, 
31).  There are also some studies on the characterization and crystal structure of azoreductases in B. subtilis (93),  E. 
coli (69, 70),  Ent. faecalis  (34, 81, 83),  P. aeruginosa (113, 
134, 135),  and S. cerevisiae  (80).  Azo dyes can be reduced 
by NAD(P)H catalyzed by az oreductases as shown in 
Figure  1  
 
The aim of this review is to summarize the 
mechanism of azo dye degradation by human intestinal 
bacteria and the potential toxicity of azo dyes and their metabolites.  We also provide a brief discussion on 
azoreductases from intestinal bacteria and diversity of 
intestinal bacteria and thei r capability to reduce azo dyes. 
 
4. HUMAN INTESTINAL MICROBIOTA 
 
The human gastrointestinal  tract contains about 
10
14 bacterial cells, 10 times the number of human cells 
present in our bodies.  The la rgest diversity of the human 
associated microbes is found in  the intestinal tract with 
about 1011 per gram in stool (121).  It is reported that most 
of the intestinal bacteria are members of the Firmicutes and 
Bacteroidetes  phyla (52).  The Gram-positive Firmicutes 
phyla include Clostridia class and the families of 
Enterococcaceae  and Lactobacillacea .  The Gram-negative 
Bacteroidetes  are comprised of several Bacteroides species.  
The other relatively few (less than 10%) intestinal bacteria 
belong to Proteobacteria , Actinobacteria , Fusobacteria , 
and Verrucomicrobia  phyla (52).   
 
With recent advances in  genome sequencing, our 
understanding of role of commensal microbiota in causing 
disease and mutualistic rela tionship to host has been 
advancing (49).  The human intestinal microbiota are 
essential to individual health.  They play important roles in 
the digestion, vitamin synthesis, epithelial development, 
pathogen resistance, and immune  responses (15).  A classic 
example in nutrition is polysacc haride degradation.  Most 
of the polymers are not degraded by the host, while, they 
are energy sources of the intestinal microbiota.  Herbivores 
can get up to 70% of their energy intake from the digestion 
of polymers by intestinal ba cteria (57).  Germ-free mice 
need additional vitamin K and certain B vitamins (137), 
because the intestinal bacter ia produce these vitamins in 
conventional animals (66).  Moreover, the intestinal 
microbiota are able to change the metabolic potential of liver by influencing hepatic gene expression through 
altering its xennobiotic response to drugs (17). 
 
An initial barrier in studying the microbial 
ecology of the human gastrointestinal tract was that most of 
the intestinal bacteria were difficult to culture in the 
laboratory.  Recently, modern  molecular methods including 
small-subunit rRNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing (52), 
quantitative PCR coupled to denaturing gradient gel 
electrophoresis (DGGE) (94) have been applied to study 
the uncultured intestinal microbial community.  
Metagenomics, a culture inde pendent genomic analysis 
method, provides a valuable tool for the study of gut 
microbial diversity.  By empl oying high resolution nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass 
spectrometry (MS), metabolomics can simultaneously 
analyze hundreds to thousands of small molecule 
metabolites in the samples, therefore, it has been also used 
in the study of intestinal bacteria, especially in the study of 
host-microbe interactions (64). 
 
4. AZO DYES 
 
All azo dyes contain one or more azo bonds.  
Although azo dyes can supply a co mplete rainbow of colors 
in theory, most of commercial azo dyes supply yellow, Toxicity of azo dye reduction by intestinal microbiota 
570 orange, and red colors.  Among all the dyes synthesized 
annually worldwide, 15% of the used dyes produced enter 
the environment as industrial effluents (110), which 
reduces sunlight penetration in to the deeper layer of the 
water.  Therefore, serious pollution occurs (119).  
Environmental release of azo dyes can also cause 
contamination of agricultural products.  Some physical and 
chemical techniques including adsorption, coagulation and 
membrane processes have been  developed to remove azo 
dyes from the wastewaters (127) .  However, the treatments 
are limited by the cost and the possibility of causing 
secondary pollution.  Presently,  bio-decolorization is being 
intensively investigated because of its low cost and 
environmental friendly nature  (43, 60, 71, 74, 120, 122, 
126).   
 
4.1. Azo dyes containing amine group 
Based on the structure, azo dyes can be divided 
into two groups, one group cont ains aromatic amine radical 
(R1-N=N-R 2-NH 2), such as 4-aminoazobenzene, and the 
other group can produce amin e components only after 
reduction (R 1-N=N-R 2), for example, Methyl Red.  Some 
azo dyes have been used safely in foods, drugs and 
cosmetics, while others are carcinogenic.   
 
Most of the azo dyes containing amine group are 
carcinogenic.  As is the case  for 4-aminoazobenzene, the 
compound has high hepatocarcinoge nicity to male mice 
when given as a single intraperitoneal injection, and a 
linearly relationship has been found between the hepatoma 
multiplicity induced by the dye and the dose of 0.017 to 
0.15 µmol/g body weight.  However, female mice were 
resistant to tumor induction under these conditions due to 
the insensitivity of them to  4-aminoazobenzene and other 
hepatic carcinogens (48).  The dye also produces liver 
tumors in rats by oral administration and epidermal tumors by application to the skin (2).   
 
o-Aminoazotoluene can produce tumors of 
urinary bladder, gall bladder and liver in dogs (96).  The 
carcinogenicity of the dye was also found in mice, rats and 
hamsters producing tumors of the urinary bladder, gall 
bladder, lung and liver (2).  It is strongly mutagenic to 
Salmonella Typhimurium TA98 and TA100 with S9 
activation (47).  The structures of this type of azo dye are 
included in Table 1. 
 
4.2. Azo dyes used in food 
Azo dyes can provide a complete rainbow of 
colors for use in the food industry. Azo dyes are used as 
food additives to enhance color of the manufactured foods, 
which account for approximately 60-70% of all dyes used 
in the food process.  Tartrazine (1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic 
acid, 4,5-dihydro-5-oxo-1-(4-sulfophenyl)-4-((4-
sulfophenyl)azo)-,tri-sodium salt, Table 1) is a yellow 
coloring agent, and commonly used in food and 
pharmaceutical products.  Tartrazine has no mutagenic and 
carcinogenic potential with a daily intake of 7.5 mg/kg 
body weight (53).  Allura Red (Table 1) is classified as 
nongenotoxic, and is pe rmitted for use as a food coloring 
agent.  Sunset Yellow (Tab le 1) is not mutagenic in 
Salmonella Typhimurium  testing strain (26).  The other non-food azo dyes further being discussed in this paper are 
all mutagenic/carcinogenic or  have the potential to be 
genotoxic in mammals (Table 1). 
 
4.3. Sudan dyes as food contaminants 
Sudan dyes are non-ionic fat-soluble azo dyes 
used in plastics, printing inks, waxes, leather, fabrics, and 
floor polish (8, 139).  The chemic al name of Sudan I, II, III, 
IV, and Para Red are 1-phenylazo-2-naphthol, 1-[(2,4-
dimethylphenyl)azo]-2-nahpthalenol, 1-(4-
phenylazophenylazo)-2-nahpthalenol, 1-[[2-methyl-4-[(2-
methylphenyl)azo]phenyl]azo]-2-naphthalenol, and 1-(4-
nitrophenylazo)-2-naphthol, respect ively, and the structures 
of these dyes are shown in Table 1.  These dyes are 
classified by the International Agency for Research on 
Cancer (IARC) as category 3 carcinogens to humans.  
Although Sudan dyes are banned for food usage in most 
countries, they are illegally used to maintain the color in 
food products because of their lo w cost, bright staining, and 
wide availability.  In May 2003, some chili powder and a 
variety of foodstuffs were f ound contaminated by Sudan 
dyes throughout Europe and Asia (63).  Sudan I was also 
found in China in chili sau ce, meat and eggs (65).  
Therefore, accurate determination of the concentration of 
Sudan dyes in foodstuffs by regulatory authorities is very 
important. The analytical techniques for determination of 
Sudan dyes have been reviewed recently (108).  Several 
methods based on liquid chromatography (LC), enzyme-
linked immunosorbent a ssay (ELISA), and gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) have been 
developed to detect Sudan dyes.  The LC methods are the 
main methods to analyze Suda n dyes.  In most cases, C18 
columns were used as the stationary phases, and the 
mixtures of acetonitrile with ac etate or formic acid buffers 
used as mobile phases.  The ultra-violet visible (UV-vis) 
absorbance and photodiode arra y (PDA) detectors are most 
widely used in the analysis of Sudan dyes. ELISA is a 
sensitive, selective, and rapid method for the determination 
of Sudan dyes.  The ELISA method has been developed for 
Sudan dyes in chili powder, ke tchup and egg yolk (8).  GC-
MS also has been used to determine Sudan dyes in chili 
powder (65). 
 
4.4. Mechanism of the reduction of azo dyes 
Azo dyes are degraded mainly via reductive 
reactions.  When the azo dyes enter body through ingestion, 
both the intestinal microorganisms and the enzymes in liver 
are responsible for the reduction of the dyes.  Some studies 
showed that the intestinal bacterial reductases may be more 
important than the liver enzymes in metabolism of the azo 
dyes (38, 39, 53).  The azo dyes are reduced to aromatic 
amines by a type of reductase  named azoreductases, which 
are widely distributed in intestinal bacteria (Figure 1).  In 
some cases, the azo dyes can be degraded via oxidative 
reactions catalyzed by oxidases  and peroxidases (30).  The 
oxidative metabolites of azo dyes were also found in the 
bile of rat (86, 117, 131, 136).   
 
Three groups of azoreductases have been found in 
bacteria (31).  Two groups are flavin dependent, which are 
composed of NADH-preferred and NADPH-preferred 
azoreductase. Another group is  flavin free azoreductase.  Toxicity of azo dye reduction by intestinal microbiota

The catalytic mode of flavin dependent enzymes, such as 
the azoreductases from E. coli (AzoR) and from Ent. 
faecalis (AzoA), is a ping-pong Bi-Bi mechanism, the 
electrons from NAD(P)H are tran sferred to substrate via 
FMN (33, 95).  AzoA has two separate active sites, and 
FMN lies in one site, the other site provides room for both 
NAD(P)H and substrate binding ( 33, 34, 81).  In  the case of 
Methyl Red reductio n by AzoA, NADH firstly transfers the 
electron to FMN and then releases from the enzyme as 
NAD+, after that, Methyl Red bind with the enzyme and the 
electron is transferred from FMNH 2 to Methyl Red.  As for 
reducing Methyl Red, two cycles of the ping-pong 
mechanism are required, as shown in Figure 2.  In theory, a 
hydrazo intermediate should exis t in the reduction process.  
However, only one research group has detected the 
intermediate from the reduction of Methyl Red using 
MS/MS technique.  The authors also reported that the 
intermediate is not stable and can be reduced quickly to the 
amine (16).  A different mech anism is found in the flavin 
free azoreductase.  In the case of Orange I reduction by 
azoreductase from P. kullae K24 (AzoB), AzoB joins both 
substrates (NADPH and Orange I) together in the active 
site at the same time, and then a direct hydride transfer 
occurs in the reaction center of AzoB.  This mechanism 
requires a sophisticated binding mode, therefore, this group 
of azoreductases shows narrow substrate specificity, only 
Orange I can be degraded by AzoB in the tested azo dyes 
(31).  On the other hand, the flavin dependent azoreductase 
families have a broad substrate specificity.  AzoA from Ent. 
faecalis  can degrade Methyl Red, Orange II, Amaranth, 
Ponceau BS, Ponceau S, and Menadione (33).   
 
The solubility of azo dyes and the distribution of 
azoreductase in the cell also affect the dye biodegradation.  
As for the water-soluble dyes, for example Methyl Red, the 
dye molecules were first dispersed in solution, then went 
through the bacterial cell membrane, and subsequently reduced in the cytoplasm by the azoreductase (55).  As for 
the water-insoluble dyes, for example 1-[(2,4-
dimethylphenyl)azo]-2-naphthale nol, the dye particles were 
quickly bound to the cells after being added to the culture, 
and then reduced on the cell membrane.  After that, the 
cells bound other dye particles fr om the culture, therefore, 
the amount of dye bound to the cells kept constant until the 
dye disappeared in the supernatant of the culture (139).  
Because almost 100% of azoreductase activity of E. coli  
was found in the cytoplasm, E. coli  lacks the ability to 
significantly reduce water-ins oluble azo dyes.  However, 
about 55% of the azoreductase activity of Ent. faecalis was 
bound in the membrane, therefore, some water-insoluble 
azo dyes including 1-phenylazo-2-naphthol, 1-[(2,4-
dimethylphenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenol, 1-(4-
phenylazophenylazo)-2-naphthalenol, 1-[[2-methyl-4-[(2-
methylphenyl)azo]phenyl]azo]-2-naphthalenol, and 1-(4-
nitrophenylazo)-2-naphthol can be reduced by the 
bacterium (139).  The mutants of Shewanella oneidensis 
MR-1 generated by random transposon also confirmed that 
the outer membrane, cytoplasmic membrane, and the 
periplasm all participated in the reduction of azo dyes (24).  
  
5. TOXICITY OF AZO DYE METABOLITES 
PRODUCED BY HUMAN INTESTINAL BACTERIA 
 
Azo dyes are degraded mainly via reductive 
reactions, therefore, we will br iefly discuss the toxicity of 
some of the reduction products of the dyes in this review.  
Both mutagenicity and carcinogenicity assays are taken 
into account for the azo dyes and their metabolites.  In 
addition, some azo dyes or metabolites showed marked 
selectively toxic/carcinoge nic, for example, 4-
aminoazobenzene demonstrates hepatocarcinogenicity to 
male mice, but not to female mice. Therefore the clinical 
data and the literature should be retrospectively analyzed 
(25). Toxicity of azo dye reduction by intestinal microbiota

5.1. Genotoxicity of metabolites of azo dyes 
The reduction of Orange G, 1-phenylazo-2-
naphthol, and 1-(4-phenylaz ophenylazo)-2-nahpthalenol 
can produce aniline (Table 2).  Aniline is one of the most 
important compounds of industr ial chemistry.  About 2.3 
million tons aniline were produced in 1996 by more than 40 companies around the world.  Aniline is mainly used in the 
synthesis of diphenylmethane -4,4’-diisocyanate (MDI), 
rubber chemicals, dyes, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and 
fibers (132).  The genotoxic ac tivities of aniline has been 
reviewed by Bomhard and Herbold (21).  When Salmonella 
Typhimurium  and E. coli systems were employed in the 
mutagenicity test, aniline wa s proved to be non-mutagenic 
with or without metabolic activation (by S9 mix).  Aniline 
did not induce direct DNA damage to E. coli and Bacillus 
subtilis in rec assays and in the Umu test with S. 
Typhimurium  (84, 88, 115).  But at the high concentrations 
(156-624 µg/plate), aniline has a weakly positive role in the 
DNA repair assay wit hout metabolic activation system (S9) 
(45, 46).  At the HPRT locus of V79 cells, aniline did not 
induce mutations even at concentrations over 1,860 µg/ml 
(54).  At a relatively high concentration aniline can induce the chromosome aberrations, which means a clastogenicity 
by aniline.  Aniline can induce tumors in the spleen of rats 
(21), but does not induce bladder cancer in humans or 
animals (5).  The data from a contact allergen surveillance 
network between 1992 and 2004 s howed that aniline is not 
an independent sensitizer, but may elicit allergic reactions in its substituted compounds (132).   
 
2,4-Dimethylaniline can elicit positive DNA 
repair responses and possess mutagenicity and 
carcinogenicity (141).  In the Vibrio test system, 2,4-
dimethylaniline showed direct  genotoxicity (97).  In the 
Xenopus frog test, 2,4-dimethylaniline showed no mortality 
even at a concentration of 100 mg/L, but possessed 
teratogenic properties (98).  One of the metabolites of 1-
[(2,4-dimethylphenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenol is 2,4-
dimethylaniline (Table 2).  
 
It was shown that 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid (4-
ABS) did not possess a mutagenic effect with or without S9 
(13, 14, 85).  It should be not ed that 4-ABS is a metabolite 
of food dyes of Sunset Yellow and Tartrazine.  Toxicity of azo dye reduction by intestinal microbiota

This compound can also be produced in the reduction of 
Methyl Orange, Orange II, Ponceau BS, and Ponceau S 
(Table 2). 
 
p-Nitroaniline was first reported as very weakly 
mutagenic or non-mutagenic in  the presence of S9 mix in S. 
Typhimurium  strain TA98 (124).  The mutagenicity of the 
compound was later confirmed in the test system of S. 
Typhimurium  strain TA98 with or w ithout S9 activation, 
but the results were negative for all other strains.  
Equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity was found in 
mice (3).  p-Nitroaniline is a metabolite of Para Red (Table

o-Toluidine was first synthesized in 1844, and 
was mainly used as a chemical intermediate in dye, rubber, 
and pharmaceutical production (44, 123).  o-Toluidine is a 
mutagen, and is carcinogenic to experimental animals (4).  
The aromatic amine o-toluidine has been recognized as 
carcinogenic (Group 1) to humans by IARC.  The 
carcinogenicity of o-toluidine as a human bladder 
carcinogen has been reviewed (123).  The recent research 
also supports the hypothesis that o-toluidine is a human 
bladder carcinogen (29).  o-Toluidine also has genotoxic 
activity.  o-Toluidine can produce DNA damage and induce 
aneuploidy in fungi and mammalian cultured cells.  The 
genetic toxicology of o-toluidine has been reviewed (44).  
The p-toluidine- m-sulfonic acid did not show the 
mutagenicity, and the carcinogenicity of this compound is 
unknown (141).  o-Toluidine is a metabolite of 1-[[2-
methyl-4-[(2-methylphenyl)azo]phenyl]azo]-2-
naphthalenol (Table 2).   
 
N,N-Dimethyl- p-phenylenediamine (DMPD) 
possesses strong muta genicity with or without metabolic 
activation (13, 14, 37).  The mu tagenicity of DMPD did not 
depend on the dose, because the highest mutagenic effect 
was obtained with the lowest dose (10 µg/plate) (13).  
Since the nonmethylated compound p-phenylenediamine is 
not a mutagen, the dimethyl group contributes to the 
mutagenicity of DMPD, when located in the para position 
to the amino group on the benzene ring (13).  A similar 
result was also reported in the mutagenicity of other dyes 
showing methyl substituents were more genotoxic than that 
of the nonmethylated dyes (118) .  DMPD is a metabolite of 
Methyl Orange and Methyl Red, which are used widely in 
laboratory (Table 2). 
 
p-Phenylenediamine is one of the primary 
intermediates in the azo dyes.  Poisoning with p-
phenylenediamine causes angioneurotic edema, 
intravascular hemolysis, rhabdomyolysis with acute renal 
failure (9).  It was reported that there was no convincing 
evidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice by dietary 
administration of p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (1).  
In vitro , a weak genotoxic potential was found.  In the S. 
Typhimurium  test systems, p-phenylenediamine possessed 
weak genotoxicity (58).  The carcinogenicity of hair dyes 
which contained p-phenylenediamine has been reviewed 
(20).  In the Umu test using S. Typhimurium,  2,5-
diaminotoluene showed positive genotoxicity with S9 mix (140).  It is reported that 2,5-diaminobenzene sulfonic acid 
induced mutagenicity, while the carcinogenicity is 
unknown (141).  The compounds of p-phenylenediamine 
and 2,5-diaminotoluene can be produced from the reduction 
of 1-(4-phenylazophenylazo )-2-naphthalenol and 1-[[2-
methyl-4-[(2-methylphenyl)azo]phenyl]azo]-2-
naphthalenol, respectively.   The compound of 2,5-
diaminobenzene sulfonic acid is  a product of the reduction 
of Ponceau BS and Ponceau S (Table 2). 
 
1-Amino-2-naphthol, which is one of the 
components of an important group of 1-amino-2-naphthol-
based azo dyes, has been reported to be a carcinogen.  
Although there is a study reporting that it was not 
mutagenic when tested in the Salmonella /microsome test 
system (36, 37), the later studies showed that this 
compound is mutagenic (50, 61).  In the standard protocols 
with S9, 1-amino-2-naphthol was mutagenic to S. 
Typhimurium  strain TA100 but not to strain TA98 (50).  
When Orange II was reduced, the toxicity increased almost 
100-fold.  While, when the structurally similar compound 
Sunset Yellow was reduced, the toxicity slightly decreased.  
Therefore, the product of 1-amino-2-naphthol should 
contribute to the increased toxicity (61).  This study also 
proved that the metabolite of Sunset Yellow 1-amino-2-
naphthol-6-sulphonate was not mutagenic, which could be 
due to the decrease in membrane permeability of this 
compound (61).  A study about the mutagenicity of 1-
amino-2-naphthol-based azo dy es also indicated that 
sulphonated 1-amino-2-naphthol at  strategic sites inhibits 
the mutagenicity (111).  Acid  Orange 8, Acid Red 88, 
Orange II, Para Red, Poncea u BS, 1-Phenylazo-2-naphthol, 
1-[(2,4-dimethylphenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenol, 1-(4-
phenylazophenylazo)-2-naphtha lenol, and 1-[[2-methyl-4-
[(2-methylphenyl)azo]phenyl]azo]-2-naphthalenol can be reduced to produce 1-amino-2-naphthol; while, the food 
dyes of Allura Red and Sunset Yellow can produce 1-
amino-2-naphthol-6-sulphonate (Table 2). 
 
Benzidine is known as carcinogen for the human 
urinary bladder (62).  In Japan, a recent study found that 
the concentration of benzidine in placemats made of cotton 
exceeds the EU regulation limits (72).  In the testing 
systems with mouse liver enzyme preparations, benzidine 
was mutagenic to S. Typhimurium  strain TA98 and TA100 
(75).  In the testing systems with FMN and hamster liver S9, 
benzidine was also mutagenic (102).  The nitro derivative 
of benzidine was more mutagenic than that of parent 
compound in TA98 without S9 ( 142).  While, the addition 
of a sulfonic acid group to benzidine reduced the 
mutagenicity (10).  In additi on, when both sides of the azo 
linkage of the azo dyes were sulfonated, the compounds 
were not carcinogenic in any animal species (27).  The 
similar situation was also found with the mutagenicities of 
aniline and 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid, 1-amino-2-
naphthol, and 1-amino-2-naphthol-6-sulphonate as 
discussed before.  In United States today, the production 
and use of benzidine has been banned (11).  Benzidine is a 
product of the reduction of Congo Red, and the sulfonated 
benzidine is a product of the reduction of Acid Orange 6  
(Table 2).  Toxicity of azo dye reduction by intestinal microbiota 
578 5.2. Capability of human intestinal microbiota to reduce 
azo dyes  
The main intestinal bacteria and their roles in the 
reduction of azo dyes are shown in Table 3.  Bacteroides 
vulgatus  is one of the most abundant bacterial species in the 
human colon (92), and may play a role in the pathogenesis 
of Crohn's disease (112).  B. vulgatus can reduce 1-(4-
phenylazophenylazo)-2-naphthalenol and 1-[[2-methyl-4-
[(2-methylphenyl)azo]phenyl]azo]-2-naphthalenol 
completely, and can partially reduce 1-phenylazo-2-
naphthol and Para Red (139). 
 
Bacteroides ovatus  is a Gram-negative intestinal 
bacterium and can causes serum antibody responses in IBD 
patients (114).  Azoreductase  activity was already found in 
B. ovatus (87).  The strain B. ovatus ATCC 8483 can 
reduce 1-phenylazo-2-naphthol, 1-[(2,4-
dimethylphenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenol, 1-(4-
phenylazophenylazo)-2-naphthalenol, 1-[[2-methyl-4-[(2-
methylphenyl)azo]phenyl]azo]-2-naphthalenol and Para 
Red (139).  
 
Bacteroides distasonis  is one of the most 
common species from human feces, and was reclassified as 
Parabacteroides distasonis  (116).  P. distasonis  has the 
activity to reduce 1-phenylazo-2-naphthol, 1-[(2,4-
dimethylphenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenol, 1-(4-
phenylazophenylazo)-2-naphthalenol, 1-[[2-methyl-4-[(2-
methylphenyl)azo]phenyl]azo]-2-naphthalenol, and Para 
Red (139). 
 
Baceroides fragilis is one of the most common 
species from the normal human colonic microbiota, 
however the bacterium can cause abscesses, soft-tissue 
infections and bacteremias to the host (91).  The crude 
extract of B. fragilis  has a strong fibrinogenolytic activity 
suggesting an important biological factor in Bacteroides  
infection (35).  B. fragilis can reduce 1-phenylazo-2-
naphthol, 1-(4-phenylazophenylazo)-2-naphthalenol, 1-[[2-
methyl-4-[(2-methylphenyl)azo]phenyl]azo]-2-
naphthalenol and can partially degrade Para Red (139). 
 
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is an anaerobe and 
predominate in the intestinal microbiota, accounting for 6% 
of all bacteria in the human intestine (143).  B. 
thetaiotaomicron has a central role in nutrient metabolism, 
especially in the starch ut ilization (42, 109) and has the 
activity to reduce Amaranth , Sunset Yellow (38, 130), 
Tartrazine, Ponceau SX, Methyl Orange, Orange II, Allura 
Red (38), 1-phenylazo-2-naphthol, 1-[(2,4-
dimethylphenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenol, 1-(4-
phenylazophenylazo)-2-naphthalenol, 1-[[2-methyl-4-[(2-
methylphenyl)azo]phenyl]azo]-2-naphthalenol, and Para 
Red (139). 
 
Bifidobacterium longum is used as a probiotic in 
functional foods (12).  The bacterium is acquired from the 
mother during delivery and habits in the newborn intestine (7).  
1-(4-Phenylazophenylazo)-2-naphthalenol, 1-[[2-methyl-4-[(2-
methylphenyl)azo]phenyl]azo]-2-naphthalenol, and Para Red 
can be reduced by B. longum (139). Bifidobacterium adolescentis i s  a l s o  a  t y p e  o f  
probiotic bacteria, and a butanol extract of the bacterium can 
increase the activity of host immune system (76).  B. 
adolescentis was also studied as a gene delivery system to 
solid tumors (79).  1-(4-Phenylazophenylazo)-2-naphthalenol, 
and 1-[[2-methyl-4-[(2-methylphenyl)azo]phenyl]azo]-2-
naphthalenol can be reduced by B. adolescentis (139). 
 
Bifidobacterium infantis as probiotic bacterium 
has the ability to reduce intestinal inflammation (22, 23).  It 
is reported that B. infantis  can decolorize 1-phenylazo-2-
naphthol, 1-[(2,4-dimethylphenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenol, 1-
(4-phenylazophenylazo)-2-na hpthalenol, 1-[[2-methyl-4-
[(2-methylphenyl)azo]phenyl]azo]-2-naphthalenol, and 
Para Red within 2 days (139). 
 
It is reported that Clostridium  species from human 
gastrointestinal tract have the azoreductase activity and these 
azoreductases share a similar enzyme structure (106, 107).  
The enzyme from Clostridium perfringens had the highest 
azoreductase activity in the test bacteria (105).  The 
azoreductase was purified and addition of FAD enhanced the 
enzyme activity.  The enzyme also reduced the nitro 
substituent of nitroaromatic compounds (103, 104).  McBain 
and Macfarlane reported a simila r finding that culture samples 
of C. perfringens  can reduce amaranth and nitrobenzoic acid 
(87).  C. perfringens  also reduced 1-phenylazo-2-naphthol, 1-
(4-phenylazophenylazo)-2-naphthalenol, 1-[[2-methyl-4-[(2-
methylphenyl)azo]phenyl]azo]-2-naphthalenol, and Para Red 
(139). 
 
Clostridium botulinum known for the ability to 
form botulinum neurotoxin ha s the similar azoreductase 
activity to C. perfringens  (99).  C. botulinum can reduce 1-
phenylazo-2-naphthol, 1-(4 -phenylazophenylazo)-2-
naphthalenol, 1-[[2-methyl-4-[(2-methylphenyl)azo]phenyl]azo]-2-naphthalenol, and Para 
Red (139).   
 
Clostridium difficile infection associated with 
some gastrointestinal  diseases (125).  C. difficile toxin A 
caused acute colitis in rats and can be inhibited by a 
compound contained azo bond, APAZA, which is a 
molecule of 5-aminosalicylic acid linked to another 
molecule of 4-aminophenylacetic acid via the azo bond.  
The reduced product of APAZA was responsible for 
protection against colitis (89).  C. difficile can metabolize 
azo dyes similar to C. butyricum  (139). 
 
Ent. faecalis is commonly isolated from 
mammalian gastrointestinal tract (56).  The azoreductase 
from Ent. faecalis  has a higher specific activity compared 
to the enzyme from several othe r intestinal bacteria (133).  
The azoreductase from Ent. faecalis  has been purified and 
characterized (33).  The en zyme is FMN-depended and 
NADH is a preferred electron d onor for its activity.  The 
structure of the enzyme has been studied and the FMN 
binding site has been characterized (34, 81).  The 
azoreductase from Ent. faecalis (AzoA) was overexpressed 
in E. coli and the results showed that cytoplasmic 
azoreductase is involved in the decolorization of dyes in Toxicity of azo dye reduction by intestinal microbiota

vivo (55).  Ent. faecalis  has been shown to possess higher 
azoreductase activity than those of many other intestinal 
bacteria (133). The bacter ium can degrade a broad 
spectrum of azo dyes, including 1-phenylazo-2-naphthol, 1-
[(2,4-dimethylphenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenol, 1-(4-
phenylazophenylazo)-2-naphthalenol, 1-[[2-methyl-4-[(2-

Methyl Red, Orange II, Orange G, Amaranth, Ponceau BS, 
and Ponceau S (33, 138, 139). 
 
Enterococcus faecium is an intestinal bacterium 
that also has been isolated from patients with severe 
infection in hospital and possesses a broad spectrum of 
antibiotic resistance (73).  Interestingly, some strains of Ent. 
faecium are gaining biotechnological interest since they 
may produce bacteriocins (77).  The azoreductase from Ent. 
faecium was purified, and shared 67% identity with the 
enzyme (AzoA) from Ent. faecalis  (83).  Like AzoA, the 
enzyme also possesses a broad substrate spectrum of 
azoreductase activity (83).  Ent. faecium  can metabolize 1-
phenylazo-2-naphthol, 1-[(2,4-dimethylphenyl)azo]-2-
naphthalenol, 1-(4-phenylazophe nylazo)-2-naphthalenol, 1-
[[2-methyl-4-[(2-methylphenyl)azo]phenyl]azo]-2-
naphthalenol, and Para Red (139).  
 
The azoreductase gene of  E. coli was annotated 
first as an acyl carrier protein phosphodiesterase ( acpD ) 
gene.  The gene product was pur ified, and it was found that 
the enzyme can not convert hol o-acyl carrier protein into 
the apo form, and instead the azoreductase activity was identified, therefore, the acpD gene was redesigned as azoR  
(95).  AzoR is a FMN-de pendent and NADH-preferred 
enzyme, and catalyzes the reduction of azo dyes by ping-
pong mechanism.  The crystal structure of AzoR with FMN 
has been reported (69).  The E. coli strain contained the 
overexpressed AzoR has a simila r decolorization activity at 
aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Unpublished data), 
which means the azoreductase from E. coli is oxygen 
tolerant.  Methyl Red, Ponceau BS, and Orange II can be 
reduced by E. coli  (55, 95).   
 
Lactobacillus paracasei is a facultative anaerobic 
bacteria found in intestinal trac ts.  It is reported that this 
bacterium can metabolize azo dyes under anaerobic 
conditions (101).  The bacterium can cause red-color 
spoilage in cucumber pickle  products when the azo dye 
Tartrazine was used as yellow coloring (100).  1-
Phenylazo-2-naphthol, 1-[(2,4-dimethylphenyl)azo]-2-

Tartrazine, and Acid Orange 63 can be reduced by the 
bacterium (101, 139).  
 
6. SUMMARY 
 
Azo dyes are used widely in consumer products. 
Human intestinal microbiota play a key role in the 
metabolism of azo dyes and azoreductase from intestinal 
bacteria can reduce the azo bond of the dyes via NAD(P)H.  
There are three groups of azoreductases: flavin dependent 
NADH preferred azoreductase, such as the enzymes from 
Ent. faecalis , Ent. faecium , and E. coli ;  flavin dependent 
NADPH preferred azoreductase, such as the enzymes from 
S. aureus , B. cereus , and B. subtilis ; and flavin free 
NADPH preferred azoreductase, such as the enzymes from 
P. kullae  and X. azovorans .  A portion of the intestinal 
microbiota community can me tabolize both water-soluble 
and water-insoluble azo dyes.  Some of metabolites of the 
dyes produced by these microorganisms are carcinogenic, 
for example, o-toluidine and benzene are two of the 
metabolites of 1-[[2-methyl-4-[(2-
methylphenyl)azo]phenyl]azo]-2-naphthalenol and Congo 
Red, respectively; and they are carcinogenic to humans and 
classed as group 1 by IARC.  Recently, we demonstrated that human microbiota can reduce  Sudan dyes to form toxic 
aromatic amines, which indicates the potential risk to 
consume food products contamin ated with these dyes.  
Further studies on the enzymatic reduction mechanisms of 
both water-soluble and water-i nsoluble azo dyes by human 
intestinal microbiota along with the potential to produce 
genotoxic aromatic co mpounds are needed.
