Covalent crosslinking ABSTRACT  
Background: Laccases (benzenediol:oxygen oxidoreductases, EC 1.10.3.2) catalyze the oxidation of a wide variety 
of organic and inorganic substrates, typically p-diphenols with a concomitant reduction of oxygen (O2) to water. 
Several molecules naturally occurring in foods and beverages (e.g., phenols, carbohydrates, unsatured fatty acids 
and thiol-containing proteins) can be modified by laccases. Hence, the interaction between laccase and these 
molecules can and has been widely explored by the food industry for various technological purposes. 
Scope and approach: The present work aims at providing a critical review on the current uses of laccases in food 
processing, at discussing the main bottlenecks for its popularization, and at presenting future perspectives. Both 
scientific reports and patents, covering preferably the last five years, were considered. 
Key findings and conclusions: Several traditional uses of laccases in food processing including baking, beverage, 
and dairy industries were detailed. Special efforts were developed, however, in analyzing future perspectives. 
The latter includes the application of laccases in the synthesis of new compounds with functional properties, such 
as antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. No less attention was devoted to the recent developments in the field 
of crosslinking of polymers, such as proteins and polysaccharides. Scaling up of the production of the laccase 
itself and especially of the novel products derived from its applications in the food sector will be essential for cost 
reduction and, consequently, for market expansion.   
1.Introduction 
Laccases (benzenediol:oxygen oxidoreductases, EC 1.10.3.2) are 
multi-copper oxidases that have a functional unit consisting of four 
coppers (a type-1, a type-2 and two type-3 coppers). Laccases catalyze 
the oxidation of a wide variety of organic and inorganic substrates, 
typically p-diphenols with a concomitant reduction of oxygen (O2) to 
water (Chauhan, Goradia, & Saxena, 2017 ; Janusz et al., 2020 ; Mate & 
Alcalde, 2015 , 2016 ). Laccases are widely distributed in nature and have 
been described in plants, insects, bacteria, and fungi. Their physiological 
functions differ depending on the organism (Janusz et al., 2020 ; Su, Fu, Wang, Silva, & Cavaco-Paulo, 2018 ). 
Plant laccases are primarily involved in lignin polymerization, one of 
the most important plant cell wall biopolymer (Mogharabi & Faramarzi, 
2014 ; Wang et al., 2015 ). Laccases have also been detected in members 
of several insect genera, such as Bombyx , Calliphora , Diploptera , 
Drosophila , Lucilia , Menduca, Musca , Oryctes , Papilio , Phormia , Rhodnius 
and Sarcophaga (Janusz et al., 2020 ). Cuticle sclerotization is the main 
biological function in this class of organisms (Sharma, Jain, Jain, Kid-
wai, & Kuhad, 2018 ). 
Bacterial laccase activity was firstly detected in 1993 in Azospirillum 
sp. from rice rhizosphere. Since then, laccases have been discovered in

446and produced from several bacteria genera, e.g., Geobacillus , Strepto -
myces , Rhodococcus , Staphylococcus , Azospirillum , Pseudomonas , Delfia, 
Enterobacter and Proteobacterium , Gram-positive bacteria being the main 
producers (Chauhan et al., 2017 ; Guan, Luo, Wang, Chen, & Liao, 2018 ). 
Bacterial laccases exert important biological functions in morphogenesis 
and copper ion homeostasis (Polak & Jarosz-Wilkolazka, 2012 ), syn-
thesis of brown pigments in spores and protection against ultraviolet 
light and hydrogen peroxide (Janusz et al., 2020 ). 
Fungal laccases have already been isolated from numerous species of 
various groups, e.g., Ascomycetes, Deuteromycetes and Basidiomycetes 
spp. (Su et al., 2018 ). They play important role in spore resistance and 
pigmentation, and have been associated with humus turnover, detoxi -
fication process (Upadhyay, Shrivastava, & Agrawal, 2016 ) and lignin 
biodegradation (Wang et al., 2015 ). The majority of the laccases char-
acterized so far have been derived from white rot fungi, which are 
efficient lignin degraders (Kadri et al., 2017 ). Agaricus bisporus (J.E. 
Lange) Imbach , Botrytis cinerea Pers., Bjerkandera adusta (Willd.) P. 
Karst. Coprinus cinereus (Schaeff.) Gray, Ganoderma lucidum (Curtis) P. 
Karst. , Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq.) P. Kumm. , Pleurotus pulmonarius (Fr.) 
Qu˘el., Rigidoporus lignosus (Klotzsch) Imazeki and Trametes versicolor (L.) 
Lloyd are examples of basidiomycetes that produce laccases (Manava -
lan, Manavalan, Thangavelu, & Heese, 2013 ; Viswanath, Rajesh, 
Janardhan, Kumar, & Narasimha, 2014 ; Wang et al., 2019 ). 
Since the 90s of the last century, the interest about laccases has 
substantially increased, and more than 4000 scientific papers on this 
theme, encompassing several knowledge domains, have been published 
during the last 5 years (obtained from Web of Science, October 2020). 
The majority of these articles have addressed the application of laccases 
in the environmental and bioenergy areas. Particularly, laccases have 
been extensively studied as a green alternative for pre-treatment of 
ligncellulosic residues (270 articles in the last 5 years using the terms 
laccase plus pretreatment ) and for degradation/modification of xenobi -
otics (359 articles in the last 5 years using the terms laccase plus envi-
ronment ). However, in recent years, the use of laccases in food 
processing has received increasing attention (Moreno, Ibarra, Eugenio, 
& Tom˘as-Pej ˘o, 2020 ; Mukesh, Nirmala, & Amit, 2018 ). 
Enzyme-mediated processes are considered clean technologies as 
they allow waste prevention, minimization of the use of toxic solvents/ 
reactions, energy efficiency, use/recovery of renewable materials (e.g. 
agroindustrial residues) and safer methods (Andreus, Silva, & Fer-
reira-Leit ~ao, 2016 ; Giacobbe, Pezzella, Lettera, Sannia, & Piscitelli, 
2018 ; Nizami et al., 2017 ). In this context, several molecules naturally 
occurring in foods and beverages (e.g., phenols, carbohydrates, unsa-
tured fatty acids and thiol-containing proteins) can be modified by 
laccases. Hence, the interaction between laccase and these molecules 
can be widely explored by the food industry for various technological 
purposes. For instance, laccases can be used for the improvement of food 
sensory parameters, to promote odor control, taste enhancement and 
new functionalities, or to reduce the number of undesired products in 
food products, among other possibilities (Forootanfar & Faramarzi, 
2019 ). More recently laccases have been used in the crosslinking of 
polymers, such as proteins and polysaccharides, an intervention that can 
introduce substantial modifications in the properties of foods (Li et al., 
2021 ). Not least, expanding the use of enzymes in general is essential for 
the development of sustainable technologies in food industry. To the 
best of our knowledge, all these topics have not yet been approached in a 
single text. Considering their importance, however, the present work 
aims to provide a critical review on the current use of laccases in food 
processing. Besides describing the new developments, the text discusses 
the main bottlenecks for their application and popularization, and pre-
sents an overwiew on the future perspectives. Efforts have also been 
done in discussing the possible costs of the practical application of the 
new developments. In order to address trends on this topic, research 
papers and patents published/registered after 2015 were preferably 
considered. 2.Structural characteristics of laccases 
Laccases are globular proteins belonging to the multi-domain 
cupredoxin family (Polyakov et al., 2017 ). These enzymes can be 
monomeric, dimeric or tetrameric glycoproteins and their molecular 
weight ranges from 20 to 130 ​kDa, depending on the organism 
(Agrawal, Chaturvedi, & Verma, 2018 ; Senthivelan, Kanagaraj, & 
Panda, 2016 ; Zerva, Simic, Topakas, & Nikodinovic-Runic, 2019 ). Most 
bacterial laccases present molecular weights ranging from 20 to 80 ​kDa, 
whereas most fungal laccases present molecular weights ranging from 
50 to 80 ​kDa (Zerva et al., 2019 ). 
The molecular architecture of the laccases generally consists in three 
cupredoxin domains with a β–barrel structure. However, laccases with 
two domains of this type have been reported (Zerva et al., 2019 ). The 
catalytic center of laccases contains four copper ions, classified as type 1, 
2 and 3 (T1, T2 and T3, respectively), and arranged in two different 
substrate-binding sites. The mononuclear copper-binding site T1 is 
composed of one T1 copper ion and the trinuclear copper-bidding is a 
cluster composed by one T2 and two T3 copper ions (Reiss et al., 2013 ; 
Sekretaryova, Jones, & Solomon, 2019 ; Zerva et al., 2019 ). These copper 
ion classifications are based on their electron paramagnetic resonance 
(EPR) features and spectroscopic properties (Gabdulkhakov et al., 2019 ; 
Polyakov et al., 2017 ; Sekretaryova et al., 2019 ). 
Type 1 copper atom presents trigonal coordination with two histi-
dine and one cysteine equatorial residue (Agrawal et al., 2018 ). It also 
has one variant axial ligand, which in bacterial and plant laccases is 
often methionine, whereas in fungal laccases the ligands are either 
leucine or phenylalanine (Mate & Alcalde, 2015 ; Zerva et al., 2019 ). The 
T1 copper shows strong EPR signals and intense absorption at 600 ​nm 
associated with the covalent copper-cysteine bond (Mogharabi & Far-
amarzi, 2014 ). 
Type 2 copper is coordinated by two histidine residues (Polyakov 
et al., 2017 ). It does not absorb in the visible spectrum but its EPR 
spectrum reveals paramagnetic properties (Agrawal et al., 2018 ). The 
laccase active center contains two type 3 copper ions, forming a binu-
clear center without EPR signals and absorption at 330 ​nm when 
oxidized (Agrawal et al., 2018 ; Mogharabi & Faramarzi, 2014 ). The T3 
coppers have three histidine ligands each and are separated by a hy-
droxide bridge. The T1 mononuclear site is located 12 amino acid resi-
dues away from the T2/T3 trinuclear cluster, and each T3 copper is 4 
residues away from the T2 copper (Mogharabi & Faramarzi, 2014 ). 
3.Mechanism of action and properties of laccase 
The laccase mediated reaction consists in a four one-electron sub-
strate oxidation and its transfer to the dioxygen, yielding two water 
molecules as by-product (Polak & Jarosz-Wilkolazka, 2012 ; Reiss et al., 
2013 ; Forootanfar & Faramarzi, 2015 ). The free radical formed will 
undergo further reactions, e.g., amination, oxidation, cyclization, 
dimerization or polymerization, until a final and more stable product is 
formed (Fig. 1) (Forootanfar & Faramarzi, 2015 ; Kudanga, Nemadziva, 
& Roes-Hill, 2017 ; Mogharabi & Faramarzi, 2014 ). 
The catalytic cycle begins with a monoelectronic reduction of a 
substrate at the T1 site. This produces an oxidized form of the substrate 
and a reduction of the T1 Cu(II) to Cu(I). In a subsequent step the 
electrons are internally transferred through a Cys-His pathway to the 
trinuclear T2/T3 copper cluster (Polak & Jarosz-Wilkolazka, 2012 ; 
Solomon, 2016 ), where molecular oxygen is reduced to water (Polak & 
Jarosz-Wilkolazka, 2012 ; Solomon, Augustine, & Yoon, 2008 ) (Fig. 1). 
Laccases are able to oxidize many compounds, but its oxidation ef-
ficiency depends on the difference between the redox potentials of the 
T1 copper and the substrate (Polak & Jarosz-Wilkolazka, 2012 ). Lac-
cases can show a large range of redox potentials, depending on their 
type, organism from which they have been isolated and medium pH 
(Munk, Sitarz, Kalyani, Mikkelsen, & Meyer, 2015 ). Based on the redox 
potential of the T1 site, referred to the normal hydrogen electrode E. Backes et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Trends in Food Science & Technology 115 (2021) 445–460
447potential, the classification into high (730 –780 ​mV), middle 
(470 –710 ​mV) and low (340 –490 ​mV) redox potential laccases is 
usually accepted (Mogharabi & Faramarzi, 2014 ). Bacterial and plant 
laccases situate often within the low redox group, while fungal laccases 
belong to the middle or high redox group. To be remarked is that lac-
cases with high redox potentials are mostly produced by basidiomycetes 
white-rot fungi. This feature enables oxidation of substrates with a much 
higher redox potential and increases industrial applications in several 
fields (Mate & Alcalde, 2015 ). 
Phenols, such as mono or diphenols and their derivates, are typical 
substrates of laccases mediated oxidation because of their low redox 
potential (from 500 to 1,000 ​mV) (Polak & Jarosz-Wilkolazka, 2012 ; 
Legersk ˘a, Chmelov ˘a, & Ondrejovič, 2016 ). Nevertheless, laccases are 
often not capable of oxidizing certain substrates in a direct way due to 
their large size, low rate of diffusion into the enzyme active site, or high 
redox potential (Pogni, Baratto, Sinicropi, & Basosi, 2015 ; Chauhan 
et al., 2017 ). In these cases, enzymatic reactions can be carried out in the 
presence of an appropriate small-sized and low molecular-weight com-
pound called mediator (Vallecillos, Sadef, Borrull, Pocurull, & Bester, 
2017 ). The mediator usually contains specific functional groups (–NO, 
–NOH, –HRNOH) and mediates electron transfer from the substrate to 
the enzyme (Polak & Jarosz-Wilkolazka, 2012 ) (Fig. 1). An ideal 
mediator is capable of producing a stable radical, carrying out several 
oxidation cycles without degradation and without influencing the funcitonality of the enzyme (Mogharabi & Faramarzi, 2014 ). 
ABTS (2,2∕-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonicacid)) was 
the first artificial compound explored as laccase mediator (Upadhyay 
et al., 2016 ), and its development aimed to solve problems associated 
with wood pulp bio-bleaching (Mogharabi & Faramarzi, 2014 ). So far, 
compounds with a N–OH group have been recognized as the most 
effective mediators, such as violuric acid, N-hydroxy-N-phenyl acet-
amide, N-hydroxybenzotriazole and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-y -
loxy (TEMPO) (Chauhan et al., 2017 ). However, some phenolic 
compounds are naturally occurring laccase mediators, e.g., ferulic acid, 
acetosyringone, acetovanillone and p-coumaric acid (Mogharabi & 
Faramarzi, 2014 ). 
The fact that the presence of a mediator increases the number of 
compounds that can be oxidized by the laccases also amplifies the per-
spectives of biotechnological applications (Kadri et al., 2017 ; Zerva 
et al., 2019 ). Currently, a successful use of the laccase-ABTS system in 
the degradation of wastewater synthetic dyes has been reported 
(Kamani, Safari, G, Asgari, & Ashrafi, 2018 ; Mehrabian, Kamani, Safari, 
Asgari, & Ashrafi, 2018 ), as well as of fragrances (Vallecillos et al., 
2017 ) and antibiotics (Navada & Kulal, 2019 ). TEMPO was effectively 
used as mediator in a laccase oxidation system to increase chitosan ’s 
functionality (Silva, Krolicka, van den Broek, Frissen, & Boeriu, 2018 ) 
and also to prepare cellulose nanofibers for the paper industry (Jiang 
et al., 2017 ). Presently applications are going well beyond the already

Backes et al.

448recognized mediators. For example, potassium hexacyanoferrate (II) 
trihydrate was reported to behave as an efficient redox mediator in the 
polymerization of aniline monomers into polyaniline. The latter is used 
as an antistatic electrode coating material for batteries (Shim, Noro, 
Cavaco-Paulo, Silva, & Kim, 2019 ). 
4.Application of laccases in food processing 
4.1. Basic principles and examples of reactions 
Sustainability, high efficiency and eco-friendly processing are con-
cepts largely explored and adopted in food industries (Upadhyay et al., 
2016 ). In alignment with these concepts there are four main reasons that 
explain the increased interest in the application of laccases in different 
areas of food processing. All of them fit well into the energy-saving and 
biodegradable features of these biocatalysts. 
The first reason is that laccases are essentially green catalysts. This is 
because unlike other peroxidases, which use peroxides such as hydrogen 
peroxide (H2O2) as the electron acceptor in the oxidation of a variety of 
organic and inorganic compounds, laccases use molecular oxygen as the 
final electron acceptor, releasing only water as by-product 
(Mu~niz-Mouro et al., 2018 ). 
Second, the capability of laccases, especially those from fungi and 
bacteria, to oxidize lignin, a component of lignocellulosic materials, 
makes them suitable for being used in pretreatments aiming at the 
valorization of agro-food wastes (Amin, Khorshidi, Shojaei, Rezaei, & 
Faramarzi, 2018 ; Giacobbe et al., 2018 ; Patel, Shahane, Shivam, 
Majumdar, & Mishra, 2019 ). Therefore, laccases fit well into circular 
economy processes, which endorse the approach to recycling and reuse, 
thus closing the product life cycle (Liguori & Faraco, 2016 ). This 
concept, as discussed in details in recent reviews that focuse on the 
subject (Mayolo-Deloisa, Gonz ˘alez-Gonz ˘alez, & Rito-Palomares, 2020 ; 
Roth & Spiess, 2015 ), is presently gaining widespread support from 
researchers, enterprises and governmental agencies. 
The third reason is that laccases exhibit an extraordinary capability 
of oxidizing a wide range of substrates, including phenols, polyphenols, 
anilines, aryl diamines, methoxy-substituted phenols, hydroxyindols, 
benzenethiols, and inorganic/organic metal compounds. Laccases are 
also capable of oxidizing various aromatic compounds, producing highly 
reactive intermediate radicals that bind through dimerization and trimerization (Mogharabi & Faramarzi, 2014 ). The interest in the 
organic synthesis of dimers and trimers of phenolic compounds using 
enzymatic reactions steadily increases due to the continuous production 
of new compounds with functional properties. 
Finally, several studies have proven the importance of laccases in the 
formation of cross-linking between polymers such as proteins and 
polysaccharides and phenolic compounds improving or altering the 
functional properties of polymers (Li et al., 2020 , 2021 ; Sato, Perrechil, 
Costa, Santana, & Cunha, 2015 ; Tian et al., 2021 ; Vuillemin et al., 2020 ). 
Cross-linking can occur via aromatic groups present in proteins or car-
bohydrates or through certain amino acid moieties present in proteins. 
4.2. Laccases in the baking industry 
The baking industry makes use of a wide range of enzymes to 
improve bread flavor, volume, texture, volume and freshness along shelf 
life. Hereupon, laccases have been applied as an additive that improves 
volume, texture, flavor and freshness of bakery products for several 
years (Minussi, Pastore, & Duran, 2002 ; Arnaut, Dauvrin, Contreras, 
Vanneste, & Viaene, 2006 ; Selinheimo, Kruus, Buchert, Hopia, & Autio, 
2006 ; Agrawal et al., 2018 ) (Fig. 2). Recently, laccases were used for 
improving the dough elastic properties of gluten-free flour (Manhivi, 
Amonsou, & Kudanga, 2018 ; Taihua, Mengmei, Miao, Jingwang, & 
Hongnan, 2015 ). Manhivi et al. (2018) reported that the 
laccase-mediated oxidation of amadumbe dough caused a decrease in 
phenolic and thiol groups, due to cross-linking of proteins and poly-
saccharides esterified with phenolics. Moreover, carbon dioxide was 
retained during proofing, ensuring the improvement in the elastic 
properties of the laccase-treated dough. The enzyme has also been 
applied to catalyze the polymerization and cross-linking of potato pro-
tein, so that smaller protein molecules form large protein conjugates 
(Taihua, Mengmei, et al., 2015 ). Thus, an enhancer was developed for 
improving the fermenting property of mucedin-free dough. 
4.3. Laccases in the beverage industry 
In the beverage industry, the polyphenols in the fruit are responsible 
for large spectrum of nutritional and therapeutic benefits. However, 
these compounds can interact with proteins resulting in the formation of 
sediments or haze, causing turbidity, aroma and flavor alteration, 
Fig. 2.Current applications of laccases in the food industry.  E. Backes et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Trends in Food Science & Technology 115 (2021) 445–460
449affecting product quality, and reducing, thus, the shelf life of the final 
product (Agrawal et al., 2018 ; Lettera et al., 2016 ; Pezzella, Guarino, & 
Piscitelli, 2015 ; Ribeiro, Henrique, Oliveira, Macedo, & Fleuri, 2010 ). 
To overcome such technological shortcommings several researchers 
have indicated the use of laccases as stabilizing agents, due to their 
ability to oxidize most of the phenols within the beverage (Gassar -
a-Chatti et al., 2013 ; Minussi et al., 2002 , 2007 ; Neifar et al., 2011 ; 
Tanrioven & Eksi, 2005 ; Yin, Ye, Kuang, Guan, & You, 2017 ). Recently, 
Zrinski et al. (2020) described the effective potential of a biosensor 
based on immobilized laccase, with a screen-printed carbon electrode 
support modified with graphene nanoplatelets and gold nanoparticles 
for the amperometric detection of phenolic compounds. This simple 
laccase biosensor presented excellent electro-catalytic activity towards 
the oxidation of hydroquinone, fast response and suitable linear range 
for evaluation of the phenolic antioxidant capacity in real samples. 
A multisensory system was developed using the Langmuir-Blodgett 
technique containing two phenol oxidases (laccase and tyrosinase) to 
detect phenolics and two enzymes (glucose oxidase and D-fructose de-
hydrogenase) to detect sugars (Medina-Plaza et al., 2016 ). The multi -
sensory system was constructed for discriminating musts prepared from 
different varieties of grapes and grapes harvested in different vintages. 
Furthermore, it should also allow monitoring the ripening of grapes for 
harvesting them according to their phenolic and sugar contents. The 
array of biosensors proved to be able to discriminate five varieties of 
grapes according to their phenolic composition and sugars and was also 
able to monitor the ripening of grapes from veraison to harvesting. Thus, 
this multisensory system can be used to predict the appropriate date to 
initiate harvest. In a pioneer study an innovative enzyme immobilization 
technique was developed using matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation 
in the development of a laccase-based biosensor for the determination of 
phenolic compounds. The authors claimed to have found a good fabri-
cation reproducibility, stability of response and selectivity toward 
interferents. The method proved its usefulness in the determination of 
total phenolics in real matrices (Verrastro et al., 2016 ). 
Free and immobilized laccases have been used with the purpose of 
juice clarification. A Trametes versicolor laccase was immobilized on a 
low-cost support (natural fibers from green coconut husk) and used in 
the clarification of apple juice (Bezerra, Bassan, Santos, Ferraz, & Monti, 
2015 ). The authors reported excellent results in the re-usability of the 
enzyme. A recombinant POXA1b laccase from Pleurotus ostreatus was 
immobilized on epoxy activated poly(methacrylate) beads and used in 
fruit juice clarification (Lettera et al., 2016 ). The treatment with 
immobilized laccase improved the sensory profile of the juice thanks to 
the reduction of the vinyl guaiacol concentration, a compound described 
as having a spicy/peppery aroma and which is considered a potent 
off-flavor. A similar improvement in the sensory profile of plant juices 
was obtained when an immobilized recombinant laccase from Bacillus 
atrophaeus Nakamura, expressed in Escherichia coli onto magnetic 
nanoparticles, was used for the removal of phenolics with consequent 
clarification of banana pseudo-stem juice, sorghum stem juice, and 
apple fruit juice (Narnoliya, Agarwal, Patel, & Singh, 2019 ). A laccase 
from the fungus Abortiporus biennis (Bull.) Singer J2 was purified and 
used for oxidizing soluble phenolic compounds in the clarification of 
litchi juice (Yin et al., 2017 ). Recently, a new combination of laccase 
catalysis and microfiltration was developed for the juice clarification 
(Wang, Owusu-Fordjour, Xu, Ding, & Gu, 2020 ). Laccase from Trametes 
versicolor was immobilized on metal-chelated magnetic silica nano-
particles and used for continuous juice clarification in a magnetically 
stabilized fluidized bed (MSFB) assisted by an alternating magnetic 
field. 
Potentially useful processes in the beverage industry have often been 
protected by inventors through patenting. One such patent refers to a 
method for clarifying grape juice to produce wine in which the poly-
phenols undergo oxidation and polymerization catalyzed by laccase 
with a subsequent ease in removal by clarification (Linlin, Song, Li, 
Huiyan, & Hongyu, 2017 ). In this method, the laccase can oxidize polyphenols to produce polyphenol oxides. The latter can repolymerize 
themselves to form large particles which can, in turn, be trapped in ul-
trafiltration membranes, what fulfils the purpose of purifying the bev-
erages. It is claimed that the grape juice clarification method of the 
invention has the specificity of using laccase to treat the grape juice, has 
no violent effect on the wine ’s organoleptic characteristics and even 
improves its stability. The action of the laccase on the grape juice 
removed 50% of the total polyphenols. According to the inventor, this 
method is superior to physical and chemical treatment methods in terms 
of specificity and stability of action. 
Another similar patent using rose dry white wine was developed 
applying the enzyme laccase in its production (Fulin, 2017 ). This 
product is made from dry white wine and rose flowers. Combined per-
centages of laccase and diatomite are used to discolor the rose flower 
jam. This is only possible due to the removal of the large amounts of 
phenols and anthocyanidins of the rose flower jam. This is a case in 
which the fragrance components and functional substances of the rose 
flower are preserved thanks to the combination of enzymolysis with 
low-temperature extraction technologies such as microwaves, ultra-
sound and high-pressure pulsed electric field. 
4.4. Laccases in the dairy industry 
One of the main challenges of the dairy industry is improving the 
texture of fermented milks, such as yoghurt, mainly because they are 
sensitive to shear and consequently suffer structural losses. In this sense, 
Struch et al. (2015) proposed to improve the viscoelastic properties of 
skimmed milk yoghurt through treatment with laccase and the results 
turned out to be a great alternative to improve yoghurt texture. Poste -
riorly, the same group demonstrated that different preparations of 
fungal laccases, such as those from Funalia trogii (Berk.) Bondartsev & 
Singer , Pleurotus flabellatus (Berk & Br) Sacc, Pleurotus eryngii (DC.) 
Qu˘el., Pleurotus lampas (Berk.) Sacc. and Trametes spp., applied to skim 
milk yoghurt not only cross-linked milk proteins in a dose dependent 
manner but were also nearly unaffected by ions of the milk. Further -
more, Pleurotus eryngii laccase and anillin as mediator enhanced all 
rheological parameters of yogurt (Struch et al., 2016 ). 
Mokoonlall, Pfannstiel, Struch, Berger, and Hinrichs (2016) searched 
for the effect of a laccase post-treatment on the microstructure and 
rheological properties of fresh cheese and yoghurt, a study that was 
subsequently complemented by Mokoonlall, Sykora, et al. (2016) that 
investigated the use of laccase and laccase-mediator systems as a 
post-processing step in stirred yoghurt at pilot scale. Both studies did not 
achieve the expected results. In the first study the radical directed 
reactivity of the laccase may have led to milk protein degradation and in 
the second one the laccase-mediator system caused simultaneous pro-
tein cross-linking and fragmentation with an overall negative impact on 
the fermented milk gel structure and sensory perception. The 
cross-linking activity of a purified recombinant laccase Ery4 (purified 
from Pleurotus eryngii and expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Desm. 
Meyen), with chlorogenic acid as mediator, was firstly evaluated in milk 
and then used in curd manufacture with improvements in both yield and 
antioxidant properties (Loi, Quintieri, Fanelli, Caputo, & Mulˇe, 2018 ). 
Finally, Hou, Yang, Fu, Wang, and Xiao (2016) developed a new method 
for producing tofu with a double-network modified by laccase which 
resulted in an improvement in texture with great potential of being 
incorporated by the tofu industry. 
4.5. Laccases in the synthesis of new compounds with antioxidant and 
antimicrobial properties 
Laccases have the capability of polymerizing phenolics to produce 
derivatives with increasing antioxidant properties (Andre & Robert, 
2015a , 2015b ; Chong, Guojian, Xiaojian, & Jianna, 2019 ; Chong, 
Jianna, Zhaoxin, & Fengxia, 2017 ; Liu et al., 2018 ; Longfang, Yongxia, 
Taotao, Xudong, & Ying, 2018 ; Reano, Pion, Domenek, Ducrot, & Allais, E. Backes et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Trends in Food Science & Technology 115 (2021) 445–460
4502016 ; Thakur, Kalia, Pathania, Sharma, & Schauer, 2016 ). A good and 
interesting example on this respect is a study conducted by Adelakun 
et al. (2012a) , two dimeric products (β-5 and β-β) were obtained in a 
ferulic acid modification reaction catalyzed by the Trametes pubescens 
laccase. The β-5 dimer (Fig. 3) showed amplified antioxidant activity 
compared to the ferulic acid substrate, as measured by the DPPH (2, 
2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS methods. This behavior is most 
likely related to the increase in electron donor groups and the formation 
of a carboxylic acid group with an adjacent unsaturated C–C double 
bond, which provides local additional attack points for the radicals. 
A further example is the use of the laccase from Trametes pubescens 
(Schumach.) Pil˘at in the oxidation of 2,6-dimethoxyphenol for the 
production of compounds with higher antioxidant capacity than the 
starting substrate (Adelakun et al., 2012b ). The main product was a 
dimer (m/z 305.0672), characterized as a symmetrical C—C linked 3,3∕, 
5,5∕-tetramethoxy biphenyl-4,4∕-diol (Fig. 4). The dimer showed higher 
antioxidant capacity than the substrate. 
Campos et al. (2016) have also used a laccase to synthesize 4, 
4∕-biphenyldiamine, utilizing p-chloroaniline as substrate by means of a 
coupling reaction. The antifungal and antioxidant activity against 
Botryotinia fuckeliana (de Bary) Whetzel [Botrytis cinerea ] was evaluated. 
The synthesized compound exhibited low antifungal activity but, 
compensating this, the antioxidant ability was increased by the dimer -
ization of p-chloroaniline. 
These new molecules are of great interest for biotechnological ap-
plications and can be used as antioxidant additives for packaging 
polymers. The purpose is to prevent oxidative deterioration of packaged 
food products, what generally results in great economic and health 
benefits. In view of these aspects, laccase-catalyzed grafting of ferulic 
acid was carried out on the lignin component of coconut fibers to in-
crease microbial resistance and moisture (Thakur et al., 2016 ). The re-
sults showed that rich coconut fibers can be successfully modified by laccases for the development of antibacterial materials, with a 
concomitant improvement of their thermal and hydrophobic properties. 
This, in turn, is likely to increase the potential application in the food 
industry as packaging material. For example, Andre and Robert (2015a , 
2015b) have patented the use of a laccase to modify a paper pulp useful 
for food packaging. In the technique, the laccase is added to the paper 
pulp in order to cause polymerization of at least some of its lignin. This 
generates a treated pulp that reduces the migration of mineral oils from 
paper food packaging to the packaged foods. 
Reano et al. (2016) described the synthesis, properties and charac -
teristics of novel bio-based oligomers with bisguaiacol-type moieties. 
These oligomers were successfully synthesized from ferulic acid based 
bisphenols by an environmentally friendly biocatalytic procedure uti-
lizing the laccase from Trametes versicolor . It was proposed that these 
new oligomers could be used as promising sustainable anti-
oxidant/antiradical additives for polymers. 
The increasing demand for antioxidant compounds for application in 
food industry, has boosted the investigations of new production methods 
for the obtainment of derivatives with improved biological activities. 
One of the most promising methods is the application of laccase in 
antioxidant synthesis. An example of this trend is the oxidative oligo -
merization of esculin by laccase from Trametes versicolor in the presence 
of ethanol as co-solvent for food applications (Mu~niz-Mouro et al., 
2017 ). The products formed exhibited excellent antioxidant properties 
with great potential of being used as pharmaceutical or nutraceutical 
(Fig. 5). 
Furthermore, it was found that the application of laccase in the 
enzymatic synthesis of hydroxycinnamoyl-peptide derivatives using 
ferulic acid and carnosine allowed the synthesis of two new derivatives 
(Aljawish, Chevalot, Madad, Paris, & Muniglia, 2016 ). Both synthesized 
compounds improved the anti-proliferative activity of ferulic acid and 
the anti-proliferative and the antioxidant activities of carnosine. These

Backes et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Trends in Food Science & Technology 115 (2021) 445–460
451results suggest that coupling of the oxidized phenols with carnosine 
utilizing laccase is a promising process for enhancing the carnosine 
properties. 
Nemadziva, Roes-Hill, Koorbanally, and Kudanga (2018) reported 
for the first time the use of a small laccase, SLAC, a two-domain bacterial 
laccase native to Streptomyces coelicolor Müller A3(2), in the synthesis of 
a β-β caffeic acid dimer, phellinsin A. The dimer exhibited enhanced 
antioxidant and solubility properties compared to the parent caffeic 
acid. In the same line, Mu~niz-Mouro et al. (2017) carried out a 
T. versicolor laccase-mediated oxidative oligomerization of rutin. The high molecular weight oligomer fractions had improved properties 
when compared to the lower weight oligomers. 
4.6. Laccases in the transformation of food polymers by crosslinking 
Crosslinking can occur via aromatic groups present in proteins or 
carbohydrates or through certain amino acid moieties present in pro-
teins. Crosslinking can be a result of direct enzymatic catalysis of 
crosslink formation, or occur indirectly by enzymatic production of a 
crosslinking agent, such as H2O2 or lipid-derived radicals, which in turn

Trends in Food Science & Technology 115 (2021) 445–460
452are able to oxidize reactive structures with subsequent crosslink for-
mation. Proteins have several reactive groups for crosslinking enzymes, 
such as glutamine, lysine, tyrosine and cysteine residues. The reactions 
obtained are dependent on the type of enzyme used, the accessibility of 
the target reactive groups in the biopolymer and on process conditions 
used. In the case of carbohydrates, only feruloylated polysaccharides 
such as arabinoxylans and pectins can form crosslinks. Potential en-
zymes for crosslinking are transglutaminases and oxidases such as ty-
rosinases, glucose oxidases and laccases, among others (Isaschar-Ovdat 
& Fishman, 2018 ). 
A laccase from Funalia trogii was successfully used in the crosslinking 
of sugar beet pectin to an edible gel (Khalighi, Berger, & Ersoy, 2020b ). 
Formation of 8-5∕dehydrodimers of ferulic acids were responsible for 
the formation of the cross-linked sugar beet pectin gels (Fig. 6). The new 
materials are firm, heat resistant gels, formed at room temperature and 
could befind application in pharmaceutical and other industries. They 
also represent an ethical alternative for manufacturing vegan, halal, and 
kosher food. 
A laccase from Trametes versicolor was recently used to prepare rice 
glutelin/sugar beet pectin composite gels (Wang, Yang, Li-Sha, & Chen, 
2021 ). The rheological and textural properties in addition to the water 
holding capacity of the composite gels can be improved by 200 ​mM 
calcium ions. The laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila (Apinis) van 
Oorschot was used to modify the citrus pectin with ferulic acid-oxidation 
products (Karaki et al., 2017 ). Spectral data suggest that covalent bonds 
between the pectin carboxyl groups and ferulic acid-oxidation products 
were established. Probably the modified pectin contains 5 times more 
phenolic compounds than the native pectin, and presents a significant 
improvement in its antioxidant properties. 
Arabinoxylans from wheat bran were cross-linked by laccases from 
Funalia trogii (Berk.) Bondartsev & Singer and P. pulmonarius (Khalighi, 
Berger, & Ersoy, 2020a ). Covalent crosslinking was proven by 8-O-4 
dimers of ferulic acids as well as clusters of diferulic acids. Using lac-
cases as an oxidant provided gels with a solid and stable texture, com-
parable in firmness to traditional gelatin gels. 
An effective method to functionalize chitosan with 4-hexyloxyphenol 
under homogeneous reaction conditions was developed using laccase as 
the catalyst (Liu et al., 2018 ). This new composite exhibited a hetero -
geneous surface and thermal stability in addition to double functional -
ities (i.e., antioxidant and hydrophobic properties), allowing its use as 
food packaging material or coating agent. A method that uses laccases from Bacillus vallismortis, Bacillus dys-
gallis fmb-103 and Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner fmb-103 to prepare 
chitosan derivatives with antioxidant and antibacterial actions for food 
preservation has been patented (Chong, Guojian, Xiaojian, & Jianna, 
2018 ). This invention uses recombinant bacterial laccase as catalyst to 
promote the covalent grafting of various phenolic compounds with 
antioxidant and antibacterial properties to chitosan molecules. A new 
method using laccase was patented for preparing a double crosslinked 
chitosan film with potential application in food packaging (Qingjie 
et al., 2019 ). The obtained film has characteristics as green color, low 
toxicity and high food safety. 
A recombinant bacterial laccase from Bacillus vallismortis fmb-103 
(fmb-rL103) was used for preparing a ferulic grafted chitosan (Yang 
et al., 2018 ). Both antioxidant and antibacterial properties against 
E. coli, S. aureus , B. subtilis , and M. guilliermondii were improved. This 
new material was applied to mango preservation as a coating, improving 
the sensory qualities of mango Mangifera indica L. 
Longfang et al. (2018) developed a method for preparing a phenolic 
acid grafted chitooligosaccharide using laccase. This new chitooligo -
saccharide structure containing waterborne polyurethane showed good 
heat resistance stability and excellent mechanical properties and can, 
thus, be applied as food film. 
A thermostable recombinant bacterial laccase from Bacillus dysgallis 
was used in the obtainment of a protein/polysaccharide composite 
membrane (Chong et al., 2019 ). The composite film was prepared by 
mixing protein, pectin and chitosan as base material. This was followed 
by the addition of a plasticizer, a surfactant and a recombinant bacterial 
laccase as the crosslinking agent. The film that was formed had tensile 
strength, ductility and antibacterial properties and could be utilized in 
food packaging materials. Likewise, Quanzhong (2017) developed a 
composite packing paper coating liquid from a laccase-grafted modified 
chitosan in association with palm emulsion. Analysis of the coating 
liquid showed antibacterial properties making it suitable for coating 
food packaging paper. 
A method for preparing a whey protein film by using thermostable 
recombinant laccase from Bacillus vallismortis Roberts has also been 
patented (Chong et al., 2017 ). The material can be used as a plasticizer, 
and the whey protein film which is reconstituted by using laccase as a 
crosslinking agent is green and edible, with tensile strength, light 
transmittance, water absorption degree and plasticity. 
Ning, Xiao, Jianwen, Baoyao, and Li (2016) patented a new

Backes et al.

453enzymatic method with laccase for preparing a functional rice bran 
protein using ferulic acid and rice protein to obtain a product with high 
antioxidant activity. 
A technique that utilizes laccase to cross-link α-lactalbumin was 
patented. The purpose was to improve its functional properties as well as 
its oxidation resistance, gelability, water holding capacity and emulsi -
fication stability. The modified α-lactalbumin polymer had enhanced 
antioxidant activity when compared to the parent α-lactalbumin (Kun, 
Ling, Tianqi, Xi, & Xindi, 2019 ; Zhanmei, Liang, Chunyan, & Xiangying, 
2018 ). More recently, a commercial laccase from Aspergillus sp. was used 
in combination with ultrasound in a crosslinking treatment of α-lactal -
bumin (α-LA) for the obtainment of stabilized emulsions. The α-LA has 
good emulsifying and foaming properties, but poor gelation activity. The 
combined ultrasound pretreatment and laccase crosslinking had a sig-
nificant influence on the functional, structural and rheological proper -
ties of the α-LA emulsion gel (Qayum et al., 2021 ). 
The crosslinking of casein by using laccase and ferulic acid improved 
protein the emulsifying properties of derivative (Sato et al., 2015 ). 
Laccase has also been used in the functionalization of polysaccharides 
such as gum arabic with oxidation products of phenols (Vuillemin et al., 
2020 ). The laccase-catalyzed chitosan –gallic acid derivative showed 
improvement in the antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and 
Staphylococcus aureus (Li, Guan, Zhu, Wu, & Sun, 2019 ). Additionally, 
laccase catalyzed covalent crosslinking of the feruloyl groups to form 
diferulic acids in a solubilized feruloylated glucuronoarabinoxylan 
extracted from corn bran resulted in the formation of firm hydrogels 
(Munk et al., 2020 ). This technique appears to be a promising way to 
produce new functional derivatives with improved properties that are 
expected to broaden the scope of polysaccharides. Through laccase it is 
possible to modify compounds present in food, allowing the production 
of healthier and economically viable products. For instance, laccases 
have been successfully applied to improve sensorial (Hou et al., 2016 ; 
Lettera et al., 2016 ) and rheological (Struch et al., 2016 ) properties of 
several food products, producing (Schirmann, Dekker, Borsato, & 
Barbosa-Dekker, 2018 ) or increasing (Nemadziva et al., 2018 ) bioactive 
compounds in foodstuffs, besides composing food packing or coating material (Reano et al., 2016 ). 
Chan, Zeeb, McClements, and Weiss (2017) evaluated the impact of a 
crosslinking enzyme laccase (T. versicolor ) on the color stability of 
structured oil-in-water emulsions containg a lipophilic model colorant 
(Nile red). They found that laccase can be used in emulsions to improve 
physical stability in front of environmental stress, such as changes in 
temperature, ionic strength or pH. Its use is limited, however, because it 
promotes color fading. More recently, Chen et al. (2018) aimed at 
improving the stability of the emulsifying action of sugar beet pectin by 
covalent coupling of proteins (bovine serum albumin) to the poly-
saccharide through a Maillard reaction/laccase catalysis. The authors 
claim to have obtained excellent results because the covalent conjugates 
exhibited an improved emulsion stability under a variety of extreme 
conditions, including thermal and freeze-thawing treatment, salt expo-
sure and low pH value. 
Yanxiang and Di (2018) described in a patent a method for preparing 
a protein-polyphenol-polysaccharide covalent complex in which a lac-
case is used in the process. The compound that was formed exhibited 
good antioxidant capacity and thermal stability with potential applica -
tion in food industries as an emulsifier to prepare β-carotene emulsions. 
4.7. Further potential applications of laccases in food processing 
Potential applications of laccases for modifying or improving food 
quality are illustrated by Fig. 7. Two of the topics in Fig. 7, synthesis of 
novel bioactive compounds and transformation of food polymers by 
crosslinkg, were already discussed in subsections 4.5 and 4.6, respec -
tively. The remaining six will be briefly outlined below. The purposes 
they are intended to serve are multivariate, a fact that certainly em-
phasizes the potentialities of the laccases as useful tools in food pro-
cessing and development. 
1)Diminishing flavor and aroma deterioration. Contaminating microor -
ganisms such as Actinomycetes , Alicyclobacillus , and Chlostridium can 
generate off-flavors in different juices, including apple juice and 
orange juice (Huang, Yuan, Guo, Gekas, & Yue, 2015 ). Spoiled fruit 
Fig. 7.Newest applications of laccases in food processing.  E. Backes et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Trends in Food Science & Technology 115 (2021) 445–460
454juices exude an undesirable off-flavor or off-odor, described as 
medical, hammy, or smoky. The off-flavor or off-odor is mainly 
imputed to the chemical compounds guaiacol, 2,6-dibromophenol, 
and 2,6-bichlorophenol. An immobilized Trametes hirsuta laccase 
has already been applied for the selective elimination of off-flavor 
substances in apple juice caused by microbial contamination 
(Schroeder et al., 2008 ). The evaluation using gas chromatography 
mass spectrometry showed that enzymatic treatment could reduce 
the amount of guaiacol and 2,6-dibromophenol in apple juice 
significantly by 99 and 52%, respectively. At least in principle, lac-
cases can be useful in diminishing flavor and aroma deterioration of 
other juices, such as orange juice, and foods. In the same way flavor 
and aroma of carotenoids can deteriorate by a series of factors 
related to light exposure, heating or changes over time in foods and 
beverages. Takeshi, Maiko, and Michiyuki (2016) have patented an 
effective and highly safe method that uses laccase for suppressing the 
loss of flavor and aroma in foods. Finally, a recombinant laccase from 
Pediococcus acidilactici CECT 5930 was efficient in degrading 
biogenic amines such as tyramine, which are generated from 
fermentation of raw foods. Removal if this toxic compound and 
improved the organoleptic properties of food (Callej ˘on, Sendra, 
Ferrer, & Pardo, 2017 ). Tyramine and other biogenic amines are 
produced by bacterial decarboxylation of corresponding amino acids 
in foods and when present in high amounts can cause nausea, diar-
rhea, vomit, and hypertension, among other problems (Doeun, 
Davaalseren, & Chung, 2017 ). 
2)Reducing the formation of neurotoxic acrylamide. Heating of food in-
duces chemical reactions that lead to the formation of heat-induced 
toxic substances, the so-called thermal process contaminants. 
Acrylamide is one of these compounds that has received much 
attention over the recent years (Rifai & Saleh, 2020 ). Acrylamide is 
formed from the reaction of reducing sugars (e.g., glucose or fruc-
tose) with the amino acid asparagine via the Maillard reaction, 
which occurs during heat processing of foods, such as potato and 
cereal products, to temperatures above 120 •C (Lineback, Coughlin, 
& Stadler, 2012 ). Enzymatic methods have been considered to 
mitigate the formation of acrylamide, being those employing 
asparaginase the most extensively studied (Rottmann, Hauke, 
Krings, & Berger, 2021 ). The formation of acrylamide during heat 
treatment in the production of a food can also be reduced by treating 
the raw material with laccase (or a peroxidase) before the heat 
treatment. The enzyme is capable of acting on asparagine or gluta -
mine (optionally substituted) (Budolfsen, 2015 ). 
3)Solubilizing insoluble dietary fibers. Soluble dietary fibers are func-
tionally and nutritionally more important than insoluble dietary fi-
bers. Consequently, much attention has been focused on the 
solubilization of dietary fibers through diverse techniques, including 
mechanical degradation, extrusion cooking, thermal processes, 
chemical treatment, enzymatic methods, and microbiological 
fermentation (Ain et al., 2019 ). A deoiled cumin dietary fiber was 
modified by high hydrostatic pressure –enzyme (laccase and cellu-
lose) treatment. Deoiled cumin dietary fiber consists in 12.26% sol-
uble and 71.92% insoluble dietary fiber. After treatment, the content 
of the soluble dietary fiber was increased to 30.37% and te cumin 
dietary fiber presented, as a whole, an improved capacity of 
absorbing water, fats, carbohydrates, and bile acids and exhibited 
antioxidant capacity (Ma & Mu, 2016 ). A method was patented 
(Taihua, Xingli, et al., 2015 ) which uses laccase and cellulase to 
modify the cumin dietary fiber under ultra-high pressure to degrade 
water-insoluble lignin. The procedure converts this otherwise insol-
uble dietary fiber into a water-soluble dietary fiber. It has been 
claimed that the patented method is highly effective and that it can 
be easily expanded on industrial scale.  
4) Modifying food allergens. Food allergy has become a serious health 
concern, especially in developed countries, and the financial and 
social implications related to these conditions are increasing worldwide (Renz et al., 2018 ). Many of the food allergens are stable 
proteins that are very resistant to digestion by gastrointestinal en-
zymes or can be digested into high molecular weight peptide frag-
ments which retain the IgE binding and T-cell stimulating capacities. 
Crosslinking of proteins has been shown to affect their allergenic 
properties. Numerous examples were found in the literature, most of 
them using laccase from Trametes sp. A laccase from Trametes hirsuta 
with caffeic acid as mediator was more efficient than tyrosinase from 
Trichoderma reesei , tyrosinase from Agaricus bisporus and trans -
glutaminase from Streptoverticillium mobaraense in mitigating the IgE 
binding and allergenicity of the bovine β-casein (Stanic et al., 2010 ). 
The T. hirsuta laccase was also used for crosslinking peanut proteins 
aiming at producing changes in the biological and immunological 
properties with consequent changes in the sensitizing potential of 
allergens. The results have revealed a reduction of the immune 
response to peanut proteins in vivo. In parallel, the laccase treatment 
depleted the peanut extract of polyphenolic compounds, leaving 
mostly procyanidin dimer B-type and isorhamnetin derivatives 
(Mihajlovic et al., 2016 ). A laccase from Trametes versicolor was used 
for crosslinking of β-lactoglobulin, using sour cherry phenolics as 
mediators. The allergenicity of cross-linked protein decreased in all 
nine cow’s milk-allergic patients, while digestibility of the remaining 
monomeric β-lactoglobulin in simulated conditions of the gastroin -
testinal tract increased. (Tantoush et al., 2011 ). A laccase from 
Coriolus versicolor was used for crosslinking of Paralichthys olivaceus 
parvalbumin using propyl gallate as mediator. Western blotting and 
indirect ELISA analysis revealed the decrease in IgG binding capacity 
of parvalbumin, corresponding to the structural changes. In vitro 
digestion showed that after laccase treatment, parvalbumin was 
more resistant to gastrointestinal digestion (Lv et al., 2019 ).  
5) New spices. Spices have been used since ancient times. Spices are 
employed mainly as flavoring and coloring agents, but their role in 
food safety and preservation have also been studied in vitro and in 
vivo (Gottardi, Bukvicki, Prasad, & Tyagi, 2016 ). Spices and herbs 
such as clove, rosemary, sage, oregano, and cinnamon are excellent 
sources of antioxidants with their high content of phenolic com-
pounds (Alan Jiang, 2019 ). Certainly, laccases can be used for 
improving the qualities of these spices and represent represents a 
wide field of application for laccases. A new food spice was patented 
and in one of the stages of preparing it a laccase was used. The in-
vention warrants a smooth taste to the low cost product (Jinfang & 
Yongxing, 2019 ).  
6) Generation of functional foods. The transformations caused by the 
actions of laccases in the constituent molecules of different foods 
show that these enzymes alter the properties and functionality of 
various foods. Several examples were already described in the pre-
ceding topics and two more will be described here. Ginkgo biloba 
(G. biloba ) leaf extracts have been used for medical purposes due to 
the presence of various bioactive compounds. However, it contains 
ginkgolic acid, which is considered to be a toxic, allergenic, and 
mutagenic substance, limiting thus, the practical applications of 
G. biloba in the industry (Wang, Zhu, et al., 2018 ). A Trametes ver-
sicolor laccase immobilized on core/shell Fe3O4/nylon composite 
nanoparticles using a novel coaxial electrospraying process effi-
ciently degraded theginkgolic acids from the G. biloba leaf extract 
(Chen et al., 2021 ), eliminating, thus, the main causes for the toxic 
properties of the plant preparations. Another application refers to 
macromolecule crosslinking that can be promoted by oxidases in 
general (laccases, peroxidases and tyrosinase). Crosslinking has been 
widely used in the construction of food colloids, e.g., to form and 
stabilize emulsions, nanoparticles, and gels. A recent review de-
lineates the mechanisms by which food molecules are cross-linked by 
oxidases and compares the applications of the diverse oxidases in 
food colloidal systems (Li et al., 2020 ). The effects of a laccase from 
Trametes versicolor on the rheological properties and microstructure 
of fermented milk products, namely, yoghurt and fresh cheese, was E. Backes et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Trends in Food Science & Technology 115 (2021) 445–460
455evaluated. The enzymatic crosslinking of tyrosine residues in milk 
proteins is expected to lead to improved structural characteristics of 
milk gels. (Mokoonlall, Pfannstiel, et al., 2016 ). 
5.Bottlenecks and perspectives 
Notwithstanding all the advantages of using the laccases as described 
in the preceding sections, a large industrial application of these enzymes 
in food processing is yet often hampered by several factors (Fig. 8). The 
text that follows, evidently, is limited by the information that is 
currently available in the pertinent literature. Current industrial de-
velopments are not always announced in sufficient detail so that critical 
analysis often becomes a very difficult task. 
The cost is one of them in spite of the fact that there are currently six 
major laccase suppliers all over the world, namely Novozymes, DuPont, 
Amano Enzyme, Yiduoli, Sunson and Denykem (Zerva et al., 2019 ). It 
must be stressed, however, that most of these commercial laccases are 
not recommended for food purposes, but rather for environmental and 
bioenergy areas. Numerous strategies have already been devised to 
reduce the production costs of laccases, including the isolation of new 
natural hypersecretory strains (Iark et al., 2019 ; Songulashvili et al., 
2015 ), the heterologous expression of laccase genes (Tulek et al., 2020 ) 
and the optimization of enzyme production (Tisma, Znidarsic-Plazi, 
Vasic-Racki, & Zelic, 2012 ; Wang, Hu, Guo, & Liu, 2016 ). In spite of 
these efforts, the production of laccases still remains quite expensive 
(Anto ¯sov˘a & Sychrov ˘a, 2016 ; Yang et al., 2017 ). Osma, Toca-Herrera, 
and Rodríguez-Couto (2011) compared the cost of production of lac-
case by the white-rot fungus Trametes pubescens using different media 
under both submerged and solid-state cultivation. They found that in 
solid state cultivation under optimized conditions, it was possible to 
produce laccase at laboratory scale, with a final price of 0.04 cent € per 
unit. More recently, laccase from the white-rot fungus Ganoderma luci-
dum was produced in 30 ​L bioreactors using the hemicellulose-rich li-
quor as carbon source (Lú-Chau et al., 2018 ). Economic analysis of the 
latter process resulted in a € 1.08 kU 1 (0.01 cent € per unit). The same 
cost was computed for the production of laccase in submerged cultures 
of Cerrena unicolor C-139 in a 120 ​L stirred bioreactor using wheat bran 
as substrate (Songulashvili et al., 2015 ). 
Cost reduction can be expected upon scaling up enzyme production. 
In this respect the commercial production of laccases still remains 
somewhat behind the stage already reached with several other enzymes, 
such as amylases and proteases. The strategies that have been proposed for improving the large scale production of laccases are generally based 
on external factors. It is largely known that the laccase production is 
affected by temperature, medium composition, pH, aeration and agita-
tion (Wang et al., 2016 ; Debnath & Saha, 2020 ). Generally, fungi are 
cultivated in stirred-tank bioreactors, air-lift bioreactors and bubble 
column for submerged fermentation (Wang, Guo, & Liu, 2013 ) while 
tray biorectors and packed bed biorectors are commonly used for solid 
state fermentation (Debnat & Saha, 2020). Effective scale up the laccase 
production, evidently, also implies in give full consideration to the 
reactor design and process parameters. Shortcommings may arise, for 
example, by an unwanted increase in the external mass transfer resis-
tance. It has been proposed that the external mass transfer resistance in 
the immobilized reactor could be reduced by increasing the velocity of 
the bulk solution and by improving the design of the impeller geometry, 
thus facilitating the overall diffusion process (Fogler, 2005 ). 
An efficient production enzymes at bioreactor scale is frequently 
hampered by heterogenic morphological growth of filamentous fungi 
which affects the rheology of the fermentation broth and the perfor -
mance of the bioreactor (Rola et al., 2013 ). Changes in the broth 
rheology affect the mass, momentum and heat transfer within the 
bioreactor (Charles, 1985 ). Moreover, it is important to adjust the 
inoculation during the cultivation, since fungal physiological properties 
such as, the age and size of the mycelial inoculum, can determine the 
development of fungal pellets (Rola et al., 2013 ). 
Dwivedi, Vivekanand, Pareek, and Singh (2010) have proposed an 
approach to scale up the production of a xylanase-laccase mixture in an 
intermittent rotating drum bioreactor. The yields of xylanase and lac-
case were higher than those observed for other solid state bioreactors, 
what recommends the utilization of an intermittent rotating drum 
bioreactor system for scaling up the production level. Wang, Ma, Guo, 
Zhuang, and Liu (2013) reported the enhancement of laccase production 
by ultrasonic treatment, which causes improved mass transfer of nutri-
ents and product. Therefore, sonobioreactors could be used for large 
scale and highly-efficient production of laccase. 
Another approach to improve laccase production is the supplemen -
tation of culture medium with an appropriate inducer such as 2,5-xyli -
dine, veratryl alcohol or guaiacol. In 200-L airlift bioreactor cultures 
of T. versicolor with addition of vanillic acid, the transcript level of lcc at 
day 7 was 2.62-fold higher than that in flasks with vanillic acid due to 
the good mass transfer and oxygen supply in the bioreactor system. 
Two other problems for the industrial use of laccases are the lack of 
long-term operational stability and the difficult recovery and re-use. 
Fig. 8.Top bottlenecks hampering laccases application in food industry and the corresponding strategies to overcome them.  E. Backes et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Trends in Food Science & Technology 115 (2021) 445–460
456These drawbacks can generally be overcome by enzyme immobilization 
(Fig. 8). In this respect, the immobilization on supports provides a series 
of catalytic advantages compared with the free enzyme, such as 
convenient procedures for the separation of medium, increase in the 
thermal mechanical resistance, improvement of the catalytic efficiency, 
and decrease in the limitation of substrate and product diffusion. Some 
immobilization protocols have allowed one-step immobilization and 
purification by a careful control of the support and/or immobilization 
conditions (dos Santos et al., 2015 ). Recent reviews have adressed the 
trends with reference to support materials for laccase immobilization 
(Daronch, Kelbert, Pereira, Araújo, & de Oliveira, 2020 ) as well as the 
immobilization approaches in food processing (Taheri-Kafrani et al., 
2020 ; Zhou, Zhang, & Cai, 2021 ). 
Many authors have emphasized that the success of the immobiliza -
tion process consists not only in improving the enzymatic activity and 
the life time, but also in allowing re-usability of the enzyme (Verrastro 
et al., 2016 ). The latter affords higher product purity and lower opera -
tional costs (Lettera et al., 2016 ). In this context, the application of 
immobilized laccases instead of free laccases to juice clarification 
(Bezerra et al., 2015 ; Lettera et al., 2016 ; Narnoliya et al., 2019 ), for 
example, appears as a great opportunity of reducing operational costs. 
An alternative procedure for improving the stability of laccases is 
using natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs) instead of buffered so-
lutions. Deep eutectic solvents have emerged as alternative non-toxic 
solvents for biotechnological applications, due to their biocompati -
bility with enzymes (Olivares et al., 2018 ; Sheldon, 2016 ; Xu, Zheng, 
Zong, Li, & Lou, 2017 ). Recently, this method was used to alter the 
activity and inhibit thermal inactivation of laccase from T. versicolor . In 
this experiment, the authors used an aqueous 25 ​wt% betaine-xylitol 
based natural deep eutectic solvent at 70 •C for 15 ​min. This remark -
able enhancement of thermostability of the laccase could unlock a range 
of potential industrial applications for laccases, for example, in 
smart-enzyme multi-layer plastics for food packaging (Delorme, 
Andanson, & Verney, 2020 ). 
The use of laccases for developing biosensors for food analyses seems 
to be a promising field. There are already several studies describing 
applications of laccase in biosensors for quantifying phenolic com-
pounds in beverages (Medina-Plaza et al., 2016 ; Rodríguez-Delgado 
et al., 2015 ; Verrastro et al., 2016 ; Zrinski et al., 2020 ). More specif -
ically, immobilized laccases have been used for the detection of catechol 
(Caballero et al., 2018 ; Mei et al., 2015 ; Nazari, Kashanian, Maleki, & 
Shahabadi, 2019 ), catechin (Aguila et al., 2015 ), 2,6-dimethoxyphenol 
(Patel et al., 2018 ), resorcinol (Lepore & Portaccio, 2017 ), bisphenol 
A (Lou et al., 2019 ), general polyphenols (Cano-Raya, Dencheva, Braz, 
Malfois, & Denche, 2020 ; Mohtar et al., 2019 ; Nazari et al., 2019 ), and 
drug derivatives (Jabbari et al., 2017 ). 
6.Conclusion 
With respect to the applications of laccases in the food industry, 
there is undoutbly a lot of research activity under way suggesting that at 
some point in the near future the sector could experience a kind of 
revolution, with a sudden expansion in the number of meaningful and 
valuable applications. Especially promising areas are, in our view, the 
synthesis of new compounds with functional properties, such as anti-
oxidant and antimicrobial activities, and the crosslinking of polymers, 
such as proteins and polysaccharides. On the other hand, it should not be 
regarded as a surprise if the biosensor sector brings to light novel and 
efficient techniques for analytical purposes in which laccases participate 
as an essential component. Finally, scaling up of the production of the 
laccase itself and especially of the products derived from its applications 
will be essential for cost reduction and, consequently, for market 
expansion. Funding
