Containing a Reactive Azo Dye
S. Sen1and G. N. Demirer2
Abstract: In this study, anaerobic treatment of synthetic textile wastewater containing a reactive azo dye, namely, Remazol Brilliant
Violet 5R, was investigated. A ﬂuidized bed reactor ~FBR!was used in the study. Before the operation period, start-up of the FBR was
completed in 128 days with an immobilized microorganism level of 0.069 g volatile suspended solids per g support material ~pumice !.
Anaerobic treatment of synthetic textile wastewater revealed that 300 mg/L dye was removed in the FBR system. Chemical oxygendemand ~COD !and color reduction in the system were approximately 60 and 94%, respectively. Under anaerobic conditions, formation
of two sulfonated aromatic amines ~SAAs !was detected due to anaerobic reduction of the dye. The SAAs were not degraded under
anaerobic conditions. In addition to the anaerobic treatment, the effectiveness of aerobic treatment was investigated in order to furtherreduce the COD after the anaerobic treatment.

Introduction
Textile and dyestuff manufacturing industries are the major
sources of dye that is released to the environment. Dye is the mostdifﬁcult constituent of the textile wastewater to treat. Dyes arelargely synthetic, typically derived from coal tar and petroleum-based intermediates ~EPA 1997 !. Over 7 310
7tons of synthetic
dyes are produced annually worldwide. Azo dyes are the mostwidely used dyes in industry ~Fitzgerald and Bishop 1995 !with a
world market share of 60–70%. These dyes are characterized bynitrogen to nitrogen double bonds (N vN). The color of azo dyes
is due to the azo bond and associated chromophores. Azo dyescan be classiﬁed in several ways. The most commonly used dyestoday are reactive azo dyes for cotton dyeing. They react withﬁber molecules to form covalent bonds and color the ﬁber with a
ﬁxation rate between 60 and 90%. Reactive dyes are easily hy-drolyzed, resulting in a high portion of unﬁxed dyes that have tobe washed off during the dyeing process.As much as 50% of theinitial dye load is present in the dye bath efﬂuent ~Shore 1995 !.
In recent years there has been a tendency to use biological
systems to treat dye-bearing wastewaters. The strong electron ab-sorbing character of the azo group stabilizes the aromatic pollut-ants against conversion by oxygenases; hence azo dyes are resis-tant to aerobic degradation by bacteria ~Razo-Flores et al. 1997 !.The widely used reactive dyes are poorly removed in activated
sludge systems ~Huren et al. 1994 !.
A wide range of azo dyes is decolorized anaerobically ~Huren
et al. 1994; Seshadri et al. 1994; Carliell et al. 1995; Basibu ¨yu¨k
and Foster 1997; Razo-Flores et al. 1997; Lourenc ¸o et al. 2000;
O’Neill et al. 2000; Panswad and Luangdilok 2000 !. Under
anaerobic conditions, azo dyes are readily cleaved via a four-electron reduction at the azo linkage, generating aromatic amines.The required electrons are provided by electron donating carbonsources, which can be volatile fatty acids ~VFAs !or glucose. In
addition, methanogenic and acetogenic bacteria in anaerobicsludge contain unique reduced enzyme cofactors, such as F
430and
vitaminB12, thatcouldalsopotentiallyreduceazobonds ~Zaoyan
et al. 1992; Razo-Flores et al. 1996 !. Although these processes
the remove color of the dyes, they do not completely mineralizethe aromatic amines generated in the anaerobic environment~Brown and Laboureur 1983; Kool 1984; Zeyer et al. 1985 !with
few exceptions ~O’Connor and Young 1993; Razo-Flores et al.
1996!. Unfortunately, treatment of the aromatic amines is essen-
tial, since they are suspected mutagens and carcinogens. It isknown that some of the aromatic amines can be biodegradedunder aerobic conditions ~Brown and Hamburger 1987; Seshadri
et al. 1994; Carliell et al. 1995 !.
Recent studies have indicated the success of sequential bio-
logical systems in achieving the complete biodegradation of azodyes ~Huren et al. 1994; Basibu ¨yu¨k and Forster 1997; Lourenc ¸o
et al. 2000; O’Neill et al. 2000; Panswad and Luangdilok 2000 !.
Several high-rate anaerobic reactor conﬁgurations have been de-veloped for treating wastewaters at relatively short hydraulic re-tention times. Of these, the anaerobic ﬂuidized bed reactor ~FBR!
is one of the technological advances. It has been successfullyemployed in a broad spectrum of wastewaters including bothreadily biodegradable wastes and those resistant to biodegradation
~Hickey and Owens 1981; Henze and Harremoes 1983; Denac
and Dunn 1988 !. Although many high-rate anaerobic reactors
such as upﬂow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors and anaerobicﬁlter reactors have been used in recent studies on the anaerobictreatment of textile dyes or wastewater, there are only a few stud-1Graduate Student, San Diego State Univ., Dept. of Civil and Envi-

The objective of this study was to investigate the treatability of
synthetic textile wastewater including a reactive azo dye in ananaerobic system using an anaerobic ﬂuidized bed reactor and toobtain preliminary data for the effectiveness of aerobic treatmentof the intermediates and therefore further chemical oxygen de-mand ~COD !reduction.
Materials and Methods
Fluidized Bed Reactors
A5.2 cm inner diameter, 73 cm long plexiglass tube was fused to
a 15 cm inner diameter, 25 cm long tube to form the 4 L reactorbody ~Fig. 1 !. The enlarged top section was used as a gas-solid
separator. The bottom of the reactor was ﬂat with four symmetri-cally placed pores through which ﬂow was equally distributedinto the reactor. Five sampling ports were installed on the reactorwall to obtain solid samples. Efﬂuent was collected by gravitythrough a closed loop connected to a port on the top section of thereactor. The recycle ﬂow was drawn from the top section ~5c m
below the free liquid surface !using a peristaltic pump and then
fed upward into the reactor at the bottom. Gas produced in thereactor went through a water trap to prevent the intake of oxygenfrom the atmosphere. The reactor was placed in a temperature-controlled room at 35 62°C. Pumice ~HESS Pumice Products,
Inc., Malan, Id. !with a diameter of 0.25–1.4 mm and a particle
density of 1,764 kg/m
3was used as support material in the FBR.
The experiments conducted in this study were divided into twotypes: anaerobic and aerobic.
Anaerobic Experiment
The anaerobic experiment was conducted in two periods: thestart-up and the operation period. The aim of the start-up periodwas to achieve bioﬁlm formation on the support material. Amixed anaerobic culture that had mixed liquor suspended solid~MLSS !and mixed liquor volatile suspended solid ~MLVSS !con-
centrations of 72.7 66.8 and 26.03 61.37 g/L, respectively, was
obtained from the anaerobic sludge digesters of theAnkara waste-water treatment plant. Feed ~COD of approximately 5,000 mg/L !
including glucose, methanol, yeast extract, and basal medium~BM!was used for the start-up period. Basal medium contains all
the necessary micro- and macronutrients for optimum anaerobicmicrobial growth ~Demirer and Speece 1998 !, including ~mg/L !

8.5. Yeast extract was used at 20 mg/L and the remaining CODwas supplied by methanol and glucose at different ratios in thestart-up mixture.
Start-up of each anaerobic reactor was achieved using a pro-
cedure involving incremental increases in COD loading and sub-strate replacement by methanol. The loading increase was imple-mented by increasing the feed rate while keeping the feed COD ataround 5,000 mg/L. During the period of initial bioﬁlm develop-ment, up to half of the COD provided by glucose was replaced bymethanol to encourage the growth of Methanosarcina . In addi-
tion, NH
4Cl concentration was decreased by 50% during this pe-
riod in order to increase the C/N ratio and encourage extracellularpolymer production, which aids bacterial attachment on solid sur-faces. Table 1 shows the organic loading and percentage ofmethanol and NH
4Cl during the start-up.
In the operation period, the reactor was fed with synthetic
textile wastewater containing a hydrolyzed reactive azo dye, Re-mazol Brilliant Violet 5R ~Fig. 2 !, hydrolyzed starch solution,
acetic acid, and BM with 2 g/L NaHCO
3. Starch and acetic acid
were used as carbon sources because the COD in real textilewastewater is mainly contributed from sizing agents ~60%!such
as starch and some additives like acetic acid. In order to bettersimulate the real case condition, hydrolyzed starch and dye wereused. To prepare hydrolyzed starch solution, 100 g starch and 40g sodium hydroxide were dissolved in distilled water and stirredfor 15 hours at room temperature, then neutralized to pH 7 with37% HCl, and diluted to 1 L with distilled water. For preparationof hydrolyzed dye solution , 5 g dye was dissolved in distilled
water and the pH was adjusted to 12 wit h 1 M NaOH solution and

the solution was neutralized to pH 7 with 37% HCl and diluted to1 L with distilled water ~Lourenc¸o et al. 2000 !. In the operation
period, the FBR was operated under seven different operationalconditions in 129 days. These different operational conditions aregiven in Table 2.
Aerobic Experiment
The efﬂuent of the anaerobic FBR for particular days was aero-bically treated in 500 mLbatch reactors to obtain preliminary dataabout the effectiveness of aerobic treatment of aromatic aminesand therefore further COD reduction. Efﬂuent samples at days124 and 125 were used in the batch aerobic experiments. Nitrogenand phosphate concentrations and COD of the efﬂuent were mea-sured before conducting the batch aerobic experiment to deter-mine if there was nutrient deﬁciency. After the addition of re-quired nutrients, aerobic microorganisms from laboratory-scalesemibatch aerobic reactors were added, to result in a MLVSSconcentration of 2 g/L in the reactors. Then wastewater-containing ﬂasks were placed in a 20°C water bath and aeratedwith air pumps with a ﬂow rate of 1,300 mL/min, ensuring thatdissolved oxygen was not limiting. The aerobic batch reactorswere operated for 15 days.
Analytical Methods
Measurements of pH were performed with a pH meter ~Model
2906, Jenway Ltd., Essex, U.K. !and a pH probe ~G-05992-55,
Cole Parmer Instrument Co., Vernon Hills, Il. !. Chemical oxygen
demand was measured with a Hach spectrophotometer ~Model
P/N 45600-02 !and vials for 0–1,500 mg/L COD. Suspended sol-
ids and volatile suspended solids were measured as described inStandard Methods 2540 D,E ~Standard Methods 1998!. Total
phosphorus and total Kjeldahl nitrogen concentrations were alsodetermined by Standard Methods 4500-P-E and 4500-N
org, re-
spectively. To measure the immobilized biomass, samples fromthe expanded bed material were collected in a ceramic dishthrough a sampling port ~5–10 mL !. Suspended biomass in the
mixed liquor was removed by gentle wash, then it was dried at105°C for 24 h. The dried sample was then mufﬂed at 600°C for1 h. The difference between the two dried weights yields theweight of biomass immobilized as attached volatile solids ~AVS!.
Color was measured with a UV-visible spectrophotometer
~Varian Cary 100 Conc, Mulgrave, Victoria, Australia !at the Re-
mazol Brilliant Violet 5R peak absorption wavelength ~560 nm !.
Before analysis, samples were ﬁltered through 0.45 mm ﬁlters to
remove suspended matter. Dye removal was measured by highperformance liquid chromatography ~HPLC !~Shimadzu Co.,
Kyoto, Japan !. The UV-visible detector was set at 560 nm. TheHPLC column was a reverse-phase Nucleosil C18 column; the
mobile phase used was a mixture of acetonitrile and 20 mM am-monium acetate buffer ~pH 9 !in a 1:1 ratio. The ﬂow rate was
0.75 mL/min. Before injection, samples were ﬁltered through0.45 mm ﬁlters. Aromatic amine formation was monitored by
HPLC. The mobile phase used for separation of aromatic amineswas a mixture of acetonitrile and water in a 3:7 ratio. The ﬂowrate was 1 mL/min. The UV-visible detector was set at 254 nm~Macherey-Nagel 1990 !.
Results and Discussion
Anaerobic Experiment
The start-up period was completed in 128 days. Table 3 indicates
the operational parameters obtained at the end of the start-upperiod. During the operation period, bed expansion was increasedand kept between 35 and 40%, which is in the typical range~Stronac et al. 1987; Balaguer et al. 1991 !. When attached vola-
tile solid values were compared with the corresponding literaturevalues ~Tseng and Lin 1994; Garcia et al. 1996; Shieh and Hsu
1996; Farhan et al. 1997; Perez et al. 1999 !, it was seen that the
AVS values attained in this study were within the typical rangereported in the literature.
In the operation period, synthetic textile wastewater treatment
was studied in the reactor. The corresponding efﬂuent pH, VFA,and alkalinity values, inﬂuent and efﬂuent COD values, CODremoval, inﬂuent and efﬂuent colors and color removal, inﬂuentand efﬂuent dye concentrations, and dye removals are depicted inFig. 3. The optimum reactor operation conditions are achieved inanaerobic systems when pH and alkalinity values are in theranges of 6.5–8.5 and 800–1,500 mg/L ~as CaCO
3), respectively
and when VFA concentration is not higher than 1,000 mg/L. Theefﬂuent pH, VFA, and alkalinity values @Figs. 3 ~a, b, and c !#
indicated that the reactor was operating properly in most of theexperimental period.Table 2. Various Basal Medium Compositions and Dye Concentrations Fed to Anaerobic Fluidized Bed Reaction in Operation Period

In Stage 1 ~days 1–46 !, the synthetic textile wastewater was com-
posed of BM, 25 mg/L hydrolyzed dye, and acetic acid and hy-drolyzed starch ~85% and 15% on a COD basis, respectively !.O n
day 10 of the operation, the color removal rate was determined as29%, and then it dropped to zero @Figs. 3 ~f and g !#. During the
ﬁrst 10 days no biotransformation occurred; dye was adsorbed tobiomass gradually until the equilibrium concentration wasreached. As stated by Huren et al. ~1994!, in continuous systems,adsorption reached equilibrium in about 10 days. After the ad-
sorption equilibrium was reached, no dye removal was observed.After a lag phase of 25–30 days, the color removal rate increasedto 80% on day 33. The HPLC measurements @Figs. 3 ~j and k !#,
which indicated 84% dye removal, also supported effective dyeremoval. At the end of this period, COD removal was less than25% on average, which is quite low. Possible reasons for lowCOD removal were considered and operational conditions werechanged accordingly in Stage 2.

Initially, the synthetic textile wastewater composition was thoughtto be responsible for the low color removal. The NH
4Cl concen-
tration in the BM was 1,200 mg/L, which is abundant for 1,000mg/L of COD in an anaerobic treatment with an optimumCOD:N:P ratio of 100:1:0.2 ~Chinwetkitvanich et al. 2000 !.
Therefore, the NH
4Cl concentration was reduced to 10% of its
initial value, or 120 mg/L. As a result, both COD and color re-moval rates increased @Figs. 3 ~e and g !#. The COD removal in-
creased from 25 to 60%, while color removal ~as absorbance !
increased from 50 to 80%.According to the HPLC measurements@Figs. 3 ~h and i !#, the dye removal efﬁciency was around 85%.
Stage 3
In Stage 3 ~days 63–68 !, the concentration of each component the
BM was reduced to 10% of its original value. The reason for thischange was that a simple analysis was conducted to see clearlywhich constituent of the synthetic textile wastewater resulted inwhich peak, and if the resultant UV-visible scan pattern of thesynthetic textile wastewater was cumulative of its constituents’scan patterns during Stage 2. The results are given in Fig. 4. The25 mg/L dye solution showed a peak in the visible range at 560nm; the synthetic textile wastewater, which also contained 25mg/L dye solution, on the other hand, did not show that peak.Based on this observation it was concluded that Na
2S9H2O,
which gave the BM a black color, masked the dye’s brilliantappearance and did not allow it to show the peak at the usualwavelength. To eliminate any possible errors in the color mea-surements, the concentrations of all the constituents of the BM~except NaHCO
3) were reduced by 90%. Even after this change,
the nutrient concentrations in the BM were still adequate for aninﬂuent COD concentration of around 1,000 mg/L as supportedby Razo-Flores et al. ~1997!, O’Neill et al. ~2000!, and Panswad
and Luangdilok ~2000!. Fig. 5 shows an UV-visible scan of thedye solution and synthetic textile wastewater after reducing the
BM constituent concentrations by 90%. In Stage 3, although asteady COD removal of 55–60% was observed, better color re-moval was recorded with respect to absorbance measurements~90%!. According to HPLC measurement results, dye removal
was 83% at the end of Stage 3.
Stage 4
In Stage 4 ~days 69–84 !, the dye concentration in the synthetic
textile wastewater was increased to 50 mg/L and the system per-formance was monitored. While COD removal in the reactor didnot change considerably, 92% of color was removed effectivelyand 89% of dye.
Stage 5
In this stage ~days 85–94 !only the dye concentration in the in-
ﬂuent was increased to 100 mg/L; the other constituents were thesame.The COD removal efﬁciency in the reactor was in the rangeof 55–58%. Color removal was 92% and 91% as absorbency andHPLC measurement results, respectively. Therefore, it can bestated that 100 mg/L dye was effectively decolorized in the sys-tem.
Stage 6
In Stage 6 ~days 95–115 !, the dye concentration in the inﬂuent
was further increased to 200 mg/L. The COD removal rate re-mained constant around 60%. Color removal achieved in the re-actor was 93% and 94% as absorbency and HPLC measurementresults, respectively. The efﬂuent dye concentration was 11 mg/L.
Stage 7
In Stage 7 ~days 116–129 !, the dye concentration in the inﬂuent
was increased to its ﬁnal value of 300 mg/L in order to observethe effect of further increase in dye concentration on color andCOD removal. The COD removal rate remained between 61 and63%. Color removal achieved in the reactor was 92% and 96% asabsorbency and HPLC measurement results; respectively. The ef-ﬂuent dye concentration was 13 mg/L. As a result, it can be con-cluded that 300 mg/L dye was decolorized in the system effec-tively without affecting the COD and color removal performance.
Aromatic Amine Production
From Remazol Brilliant Violet 5R, the formation of two sul-fonated aromatic amines is expected under anaerobic conditions.Production of the sulfonated aromatic amines was analyzed withHPLC. The ﬁrst peak obtained was due to a benzene-based aro-matic amine and the second peak to a naphthalene-based amine~through comparison of retention times with amine standards in
Macherey-Nagel 1990 !. With the increase in dye concentration
given to the reactor, aromatic amine production also increased. Itmust be noted that this was only a qualitative analysis and quan-tiﬁcation of these aromatic amines was not within the scope of thestudy.
Aerobic Experiment
Under aerobic conditions, COD values were reduced from 44062.1 to about 261.7 628, by about 40%, after a 6 h running time.
After that time there was an increase in COD values with time.However these values were ﬂuctuating, which could be due toexperimental errors in the COD measurement. The COD reduc-tion ina6hrunning time was probably due to degradation of
readily degradable compounds in the form of acetic acid and

textile wastewater treatment. I na6hperiod, the readily degrad-
able compounds were exhausted. Therefore, microorganismswhich could not easily use sulfonated aromatic amines as carbonsource began an endogenous decay.
Degradation of Aromatic Amines
According to the results of HPLC analysis, the aerobic phaseintroduced an alteration in the chromatograms, mainly that thebenzene-based sulfoamine was partially converted. The areaunder the peak in the HPLC measurements corresponding to thebenzene-based sulfoamine decreased by 40% after aerobic treat-ment. However, the naphthalene-based amine peak remained al-most unchanged after the aerobic phase.
Difﬁculties with the mineralization of sulfonated aromatic
amines under aerobic conditions after anaerobic reduction of azodyes were also encountered byTan et al. ~1999!. However, Brown
and Laboureur ~1983!indicate that many aromatic amines are
readily degraded under aerobic conditions. This study suggeststhat degradation of sulfonated aromatic amines ~SAAs !is difﬁcult
with unacclimated aerobic cultures. With cultures adapted toSAAs, on the other hand, complete mineralization and thereforefurther COD reduction might be achieved ~Fiegel and Knackmuss
1988!.
Conclusions
The results of this research indicate that FBRs could successfully
be applied for the treatment of textile industry wastewater with alow hydraulic detention time, and stable operation and high colorremoval efﬁciency could be achieved.The following speciﬁc con-clusions can be made based on the experimental outputs of thisstudy.• Three hundred mg/L Remazol Brilliant Violet 5R was decol-
orized successfully in the FBR system without negatively af-fecting the COD and color removal performance. The colorand COD removal rates attained in the anaerobic reactor wereabout 94 and 60%, respectively.
• Formation of two SAAs was detected due to the reduction of
Remazol Brilliant Violet 5R under anaerobic conditions. Re-moval of these amines was not observed in the anaerobic re-actor.
• Under aerobic conditions, SAAs could not be completely min-
eralized with an unacclimated culture and therefore consider-able COD reduction was not achieved.
• Although color was removed satisfactorily under anaerobic
conditions, the efﬂuent COD was still high for discharge.Therefore, a two-stage conﬁguration consisting of anaerobicand aerobic ~as a polishing step !reactors should be used in
order to lower the efﬂuent COD of textile wastewaters fordischarge into receiving water bodies.
