Abstract
Biocatalytic decolorization of azo dyes is hampered by their recalcitrance and the characteristics of textile effluents. Alka-line pH and heavy metals present in colored wastewaters generally limit the activity of enzymes such as laccases of fungal origin; this has led to an increasing interest in bacterial laccases. In this work, the dye decolorization ability of LAC_2.9, a laccase from the thermophilic bacterial strain Thermus sp. 2.9, was investigated. Its resistance towards different pHs and toxic heavy metals frequently present in wastewaters was also characterized. LAC_2.9 was active and highly stable in the pH range of 5.0 to 9.0. Even at 100 mM  Cd
+2,  As+5 and  Ni+2 LAC_2.9 retained 99%, 86% and 75% of its activity, respectively. 
LAC_2.9 was capable of decolorizing 98% of Xylidine, 54% of RBBR, 40% of Gentian Violet, and 33% of Methyl Orange after 24 h incubation at pH 9, at 60 °C, without the addition of redox mediators. At acidic pH, the presence of the mediator 1-hydroxybenzotriazole generally increased the catalytic effectiveness. We analyzed the degradation products of laccase-treated Xylidine and Methyl Orange by capillary electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, and propose a degradation pathway for these dyes. For its ability to decolorize recalcitrant dyes, at pH 9, and its stability under the tested conditions, LAC_2.9 could be effectively used to decolorize azo dyes in alkaline and heavy metal containing effluents.

Introduction
Laccases are multicopper oxidases (MCO) that couple the oxidation of a wide range of substrates with the reduction of molecular oxygen to water. Due to their ability to oxi-dize phenolic compounds, laccases can act on a variety of persistent environmental pollutants present in the waste of several industrial processes such as dyes from textile efflu-ents (Singh et al. 2015; Unuofin et al. 2019). The colored effluents discharged into water bodies can cause an increase in biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxy -
gen demand (COD) and decrease the transmittance of light, reducing the photosynthetic activity in these ecosystems. Additionally, the release of dyes into the environment is toxic to living organisms (Collivignarelli et al. 2019). The Communicated by I. Cann.

degradation processes in the treatment plants generally 
remove a low percentage of dye content and often result in by-products of greater toxicity, such as carcinogenic amines from azo dyes (Collivignarelli et al. 2019; Zaharia and Suteu 2012). Thus, the application of laccases for decolorization and detoxification of effluents from the textile industries is particularly attractive. The use of low-molecular weight compounds as redox mediators can broaden their oxidation range by forming stable radicals that may continue oxidiz-ing large molecules and non-phenolic substrates (Blánquez et al. 2019).
There are many reports on fungal extracts and purified 
laccases combined with synthetic or natural mediators capa-ble of decolorizing several groups of textile dyes (Unuofin et al. 2019). Fungal laccases are typically maximally active 
at acidic pH, which limits their use in textile dyes-containing effluents that are generally alkaline due to the presence of auxiliary dyeing compounds (Kokol et al. 2007). In these 
conditions, bacterial laccases show more potential com-pared with fungal laccases, but still need further research (Blánquez et al. 2019; Guan et al. 2018; Ma et al. 2018). 
Decolorization of azo dyes by bacteria has been previously described (Blánquez et al. 2019; Garg and Tripathi 2016; 
Mandic et al. 2019) and potential degradation pathways have been identified (Thakur et al. 2014; Xia et al. 2019). Despite 
this, information on the mechanism of azo dyes degradation by purified bacterial laccases is limited. Pereira et al. (2009) proposed a mechanism for decolorization of the azo dye, Sudan Orange G, by CotA-laccase from Bacillus subtilis  
which uses radical coupling reactions that result in oligom-ers and potential polymers. Degradation of the azo dye Reac-tive blue 52 by laccase 12B from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens  
expressed in Escherichia coli was monitored by HPLC–DAD and the resulting precipitate was analyzed by FTIR spectros-copy. The solution contained a unique product peak without chromophore, while the aggregates (assigned to a polymeric form of the dye) retained the blue color (Loncar et al. 2013). Recently the mechanism for Evans blue decolorization by a mutant of CotA-laccase from Bacillus pumilus expressed in Pichia pastoris was analyzed through liquid chromatogra-phy–mass spectrometry; the azo bond (–N=N–) was trans-formed into  N
2 instead of toxic aniline compounds, in which 
water was the only by-product in the degradation process. Moreover, biological toxicity test showed that this laccase could efficiently detoxify Evans blue (Xia et al. 2019).
We have previously reported the expression and biochem-
ical characterization of a bacterial laccase (LAC_2.9) from the thermophilic strain Thermus sp. 2.9 and evaluated its ability to modify lignocellulosic biomass (Navas et al. 2019). In this work, we investigated the decolorization ability of LAC_2.9 on different types of dyes, and the effect of two redox mediators in the process. We also characterized the resistance of the enzyme towards different pHs, and toxic heavy metals frequently present in wastewaters. Addition -
ally, insights into the mechanism of LAC_2.9 action on the azo dyes Xylidine and Methyl Orange are presented.
Materials and methods
Enzyme preparation
Recombinant LAC_2.9 was expressed in E. coli  and purified 
as described previously (Navas et al. 2019). Briefly, genomic DNA from Thermus sp. 2.9 was used to amplify the gene coding for LAC_2.9 fused to an N-terminal 6xHis tag by PCR. The product was cloned into vector pJexpress 404 (DNA2.0) and the recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli. Expression of LAC_2.9 was induced by add-
ing IPTG (1 mM final) to the LB medium when the cul-ture reached an  OD
600 of 0.8 together with  CuSO4 (0.5 mM 
final). The soluble LAC_2.9 was purified using a Ni–NTA affinity column. Purified LAC_2.9 activity was detected colorimetrically measuring the absorbance at 436  nm (Ɛ = 36,000 M
−1cm−1) of oxidized ABTS (2,2′ -azino-di-
[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate]). Assays were performed at 60 °C and contained 1 mM  CuSO
4 and 3 mM ABTS in 
Britton-Robinson buffer pH 5.0 (Mongay and Cerdà 1974). One unit (U) of laccase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme needed to oxidize 1 μmol of ABTS in 1 min.
pH stability and effect of metal ions on activity 
of LAC_2.9
To evaluate the effect of cations on LAC_2.9, each one of 
Cd(NO3)2, Cr(NO3)3, Pb(NO3)2,  NiSO4 and  Na2HAsO4 was 
added at final concentrations of 1, 10 and 100 mM, to the reaction conducted at pH 5.0 and containing 1 mM Cu  SO
4, 
which was taken as control for 100% activity. The effect of  CuSO
4 at 10 and 100 mM was also examined. The pH stabil-
ity of LAC_2.9 was evaluated by determining the residual activity of the enzyme after 24 h incubation at 25 °C in Britton-Robinson buffer at pHs 5.0, 7.0 and 9.0, using ABTS as substrate.
In vitro decolorization of dyes by LAC_2.9
The decolorization assays were performed in Britton-Rob-inson buffer at three pH values (5.0, 7.0 and 9.0) in 0.5 ml volume containing the dye (at the concentration required for each dye to obtain 1.0 absorbance units at its maxi-mum wavelength), 1 mM CuSO4, and 0.075 U of purified LAC_2.9. When added to the reaction, the redox media-tor [1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) or para-hydroxyben-zoic acid (pHBA), Sigma] was set to 0.5 mM. Reactions were incubated at 60 °C. Absorbance was measured after Extremophiles 
1 3
6 and 24 h for reactions containing the following dyes, at 
the indicated wavelengths: azo dyes, Xylidine (Ponceau 2R, λ
max = 505 nm) and Methyl Orange ( λmax = 460 nm); 
triphenylmethane dyes, Malachite Green (λmax = 618 nm) 
and Gentian Violet (λmax = 590 nm), the antraquinone dye, 
Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) (λmax = 590 nm); and 
the indigoid dye Indigo Carmine (λmax = 608 nm). Controls 
without laccase were conducted in parallel. All the reac-tions were performed in triplicate. Decolorization activity was calculated: % Decolorization = [(I − F)/I] × 100, where 
I = initial absorbance and F = absorbance of decolorized 
reaction (Parshetti et al. 2006).
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical experiments were carried out with a poten-tiostat (TEQ, Argentina), provided with a digital signal generator for implementation of different electrochemical techniques. A glassy carbon working electrode (0.25 cm
2 
area), an Ag/AgClKCl 3 M reference electrode (BAS) and a platinum wire auxiliary electrode were used for differential pulse polarography (DPP). DPP experiments were carried out using a potential ramp starting at 0.0 V and going up to + 0.800 V or + 0.900 V (vs Ag/AgCl) in a pulsed man-
ner. The following experimental parameters were employed: potential step = 0.5 mV, pulse width = 0.06 s, pulse ampli-
tude = 50 mV, and pulse period = 0.2 s.
Capillary electrophoresis–mass spectra analysis
Laccase or laccase/HBT decolorized azo dyes (after 24 h incubation at pH 7) were analyzed by capillary electropho-resis (CE) and mass spectra (MS) and compared with the control without the enzyme. Initial dye concentration was respectively 33.6 mg l
−1 and 18.3 mg l−1 for Xylidine and 
Methyl Orange. About the electrophoresis, separations were performed in a P/ACE MDQ (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), equipped with a UV–Vis photodiode array detector. The software 32 KaratTM (Beckman Coulter) was used for data processing. All capillary electrophoresis experiments were performed at 25 °C. UV detection was carried out at 254, 460 and 505 nm. An untreated fused-silica capillary (Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ, USA) of 75 µm I.D. × 375 mm O.D. was used. Its total length was 62 cm and the effective length was 50 cm to the detector. The background electrolyte solution (BGE) consisted of 50 mM ammonium carbonate buffer (pH 9.5). After each run, the capillary was washed with 0.1 M NaOH for 5 min, then rinsed with dis-tilled water for 3 min and BGE for 4 min. Aliquots of the sample solutions were introduced by 5 s at 3.5 kPa and the separation voltage was 20 kV. Finally, the capillary was flushed with water for 10 min at end of the day (Takeda et al. 1999). Mass spectrometric detection was performed using a Thermo Scientific TSQ Quantum Access MAX triple quad-rupole system Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, CA, USA) with electrospray ionization. Ionization in negative ion mode was registered. The spray voltage was set at 3500 V. 
Nitrogen was employed as the nebulizer and auxiliary gas, set at 60 and 20 arbitrary units, respectively. The capillary temperature and vaporizer were set at 275 °C and 350  °C, 
respectively. For collision-induced dissociation, 99.997% argon (Grade 4.7) was used at 1.5 mTorr.
Chemicals
Indigo Carmine was from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA, USA), Malachite Green from Mallinckrodt (Phillipsburg, NJ, USA). All other chemicals were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA).
Statistical analysis
The data presented are mean values of triplicate assays with a standard error of less than 5%. Infostat software (Di Rienzo et al. 2017) was used to analyze the variance. The significant 
differences among treatments were compared by Tukey’s multiple range test at 5% level of probability.
Results and discussion
In vitro decolorization of dyes by LAC_2.9
In this paper, the decolorization of two azo dyes with diverse structural configurations, two triphenylmethane dyes, an anthraquinonic dye and an indigoid dye was investigated at three different pHs using purified LAC_2.9. The dyes were decolorized with variable efficiency depending on their structural class and the pH of the reaction (Table  1). 
Results at pHs 7 and 9 are not shown for Indigo Carmine and Malachite Green as both dyes were decolorized at these pHs in the control reactions without enzyme. LAC_2.9 fully decolorized the dye Indigo Carmine without the addition of redox mediators after 6 h at pH 5. The optimal pH for the decolorization activity of LAC_2.9 depended on the dye assayed. For example, LAC_2.9 displayed higher activity at acidic pH with Methyl Orange, and at alkaline pH with Xylidine. The results showed that at acidic pH, the pres-ence of HBT increased the catalytic effectiveness better than pHBA, which only improved LAC_2.9 Gentian Violet decolorization efficiency at pHs 7 and 9 (Table  1). Neverthe-
less, LAC_2.9 was capable of decolorizing 98% of Xylidine, 54% of RBBR, 40% of Gentian Violet, and 33% of Methyl Orange after 24 h incubation without the addition of redox mediators at pH 9. Activity at this pH demonstrates the potential for treatment of wastewater effluents. Extremophiles

The purified recombinant bacterial laccase SilA from 
Streptomyces ipomoeae CECT 3341 was also active over 
wide temperature and pH ranges and it decolorized dyes of diverse chemical structures: 30, 14 and 10% of the azoic dyes Reactive Black 5, Orange II and Tartrazine, and 12% of the triphenylmethane dye Cresol Red after 24 h incubation at 35 °C and pH 8 (Blánquez et al. 2019), but this enzyme could not decolorized the azoic dye Acid Orange 63 and the anthraquinonic Acid Black 48 without the addition of redox mediators. The recombinant laccase from Streptomy -
ces cyaneus was also incapable of decolorizing the azo dye Orange II (Moya et al. 2010). However, a thermostable lac-
case from Thermus thermophilus SG0.5JP17-16 expressed in P. pastoris decolorized 100%, 94%, 94% of the azoic dyes 
Congo Red, Reactive Black B and Reactive Black WNN, respectively, and 73% of the anthraquinonic RBBR, after 24 h incubation at 70 °C and pH 7.5 (Liu et al. 2015). The purified laccase from Geobacillus thermocatenulatus decol-orized 60% of Congo Red after 6 h of incubation and up to 99% after 32 h of incubation (Verma and Shirkot 2014).
Regarding the mono-azo dyes with different molecular 
configuration that were assayed, Xylidine was decolorized more efficiently than Methyl Orange by purified LAC_2.9, with 98% decolorization attained at pH 9 after 24 h of incubation (Table  1). Decolorization of Methyl Orange 
was most efficient at pH 5, in presence of HBT (68% after 24 h). The structural heterogeneity influences the charge density distribution of the dye’s molecules and hence their redox potentials (Ciullini et al. 2008). In turn, the relation-ship between the redox potential of the laccase and the dye substrate is a critical factor in the decolorization process of these compounds. Fungal laccases with high redox potential can oxidize a wide range of substrates; but bacterial laccases usually possess low and medium redox potentials [i.e. SilA of S. ipomoeae, 337 mV (Blánquez et al. 2019); B. subtilis  
CotA, 455 mV (Pereira et al., 2009)] limiting their oxida-tive ability. Nevertheless, the redox potential of the Steno-trophomonas maltophilia AAP56 laccase was determined at 638 mV (Galai et al. 2014). The best efficiency in Xylidine decolorization at alkaline pHs can be explained by the shift of dye redox potential from 750 mV (at pH 5) to 530 mV (at pHs 7 or 9), thus decreasing the need of HBT addition (HBT redox potential 710 mV) (Supplementary Material, Fig. 1a-f). Therefore, the enzymatic oxidation of Xylidine Table 1  Percentage of dye decolorization after 6 and 24  h incuba-

HBT or pHBA redox mediators. Values represent the mean of three replicates, with a standard error of less than 5%. Control values with-out laccase were subtracted in each case

is favored when Xylidine ortho hydroxyl group is depro-
tonated. Conversely, when Methyl Orange is oxidized by LAC_2.9, the redox mediator contributes by reducing the redox potential of the substrate (from 580 to 530 mV) (Sup-plementary Material, Figure 1g, h).
pH‑stability of LAC_2.9 and effect of metal ions 
on activity
The pH optimum of activity of LAC_2.9 varies depending 
on the substrate, e.g. 5.0 for ABTS, and 6.0 for 2,6-dimeth-oxyphenol (DMP) (Navas et al. 2019). To evaluate the pH stability of LAC 2.9 the activity of the enzyme was deter -
mined after 24 h incubation at room temperature at three different pHs (5.0, 7.0, 9.0). Percentages of relative activity were respectively 90.3 ± 8.3, 101.8 ± 2.1 and 94.4 ± 17.0. The high residual activity of the enzyme at the three pHs assayed indicates that the decolorization of dyes at these pH values was not affected by enzyme instability in the reaction through incubation time.
The effect on the activity of LAC_2.9 of several metal 
ions frequently present in textile effluents was also evalu-ated. Each of these was assessed at concentrations 1, 10 and 100 mM (Table  2). When assaying acidic cations such 
as  Cr
+3 and  Pb+2 at high concentrations a precipitate was 
formed (Burriel Marti et al. 2002), which prevented spec-trophotometric determination. Neither of the other metal ions tested showed a remarkable inhibitory effect on laccase activity up to a concentration of 10 mM. Even at 100 mM LAC_2.9 retained 99%, 86% and 75% of its activity with  Cd
2+,  As5+ and  Ni2+ respectively, but only 31% with  Cu2+. 
Earlier reports also showed that  Cu2+ can inhibit substrate 
conversion by laccase (Kim and Nicell 2006) possibly through interruption of the enzyme electron transport sys-tem (Torres et al. 2003).
These results supply more evidence of LAC_2.9 robust-
ness for industrial applications. The thermal stability of LAC_2.9 was assessed previously (Navas et al. 2019). After 16 h at 60 °C LAC_2.9 showed no decrease of activ -
ity, and retained 80% activity after 16 h at 70 °C and after 6 h at 80 °C. The effect of  Mg
2+,  Mn2+,  Zn2+,  Ca2+, sodium 
dodecyl sulfate (SDS), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), dithiothreitol (DTT) and NaCl on the activity of LAC_2.9 was also evaluated by Navas et al. (2019). Each of these reagents was tested at a concentration of 1 mM and NaCl also at 10 and 100 mM. With respect to metal ions, LAC_2.9 was more resistant than LacTT from T. thermophi-lus SG0.5JP17-16 (Liu et al. 2015).
Proposed mechanism for Xylidine and Methyl 
Orange decolorization by LAC_2.9
We performed two analytical methodologies to evaluate the 
mechanism involved in the decolorization of the azo dyes at pH 7: capillary electrophoresis (CE) and mass spectrometry (MS). The results of CE are shown in Fig.  1 (absorbance 
detected at 254 nm) and Supplementary Material, Fig. 2 (wavelengths in the visible spectrum). The electrophoretic profile of Xylidine appeared between 8 and 9.5 min and was reduced considerably after laccase treatment without media-tor (Fig.  1a, grey dotted line). The reaction with laccase and 
HBT showed somewhat less reduction in the Xylidine sig-nal (Fig.  1a, upper line), which is in accordance with the 
results for decolorization (Table  1). In the presence of HBT 
alone the Xylidine signal remained unchanged (Fig.  1a, bold 
black broken line). In the mass spectra of Xylidine (Fig.  2a) 
structures representing the dye (m/z 434.4430, m/z 227.4508 
and m/z 454.9015) almost completely disappeared after 
LAC_2.9 treatment, and two degradation products appeared (m/z 158.1320, 170.6363) (Fig.  2b). In the presence of HBT, 
no new peaks were recorded (Fig.  2c and Supplementary 
Material, Fig. 3), indicating that HBT is not mediating the degradation of this dye at pH 7.
Figure  1b shows the CE-UV/DAD for Methyl Orange 
treated or not with LAC_2.9 in presence and absence of HBT at pH 7. The dye profile appeared at 7 min. After LAC_2.9 treatment, this peak shifted its retention time slightly and it is shown as a split peak or two unresolved peaks (Fig. 1 b, grey dotted line). This may be due to loss 
of water for Methyl Orange treated with LAC_2.9 (as confirmed by later MS experiments); however, it does not cause a significant change in electrophoretic mobil-ity or signal intensity, and hence, it is not evident a pro-cess of degradation. In presence of HBT, a new peak around 6.5 min appeared and the peak at 7 min decreased (Fig.  1b, bold black broken line). These results suggest 
that in presence of HBT a different mechanism of Methyl Orange decolorization takes place. By mass spectra, we observed that Methyl Orange (m/z 304.3402) (Fig.  3a) 
decreased after laccase treatment, while a new structure (m/z 288.3408) that could be attributed to dehydrated

Methyl Orange appeared (Fig.  3b). This structure, with 
a lower conjugation degree, might be responsible for the 
observed change in color intensity (Table  1), but no evi-
dence of degradation is shown. When HBT was supplied to the reaction, we observed differences in the mechanism of decolorization: a decrease in dye structure intensity at m/z 304.3402 and 288.3408, accompanied by at least 
two peaks of lower m/z, possibly degradation products Fig. 1  Electropherograms of

(Fig.  3c). These peaks were not observed with HBT with-
out laccase (Supplementary Material, Fig. 4). Taking 
together, these results indicate that HBT acts as mediator in the degradation of Methyl Orange by LAC_2.9. A pro-posed mechanism is shown in Fig.  4, where HBT forms a 
radical cation which co-oxidizes the dye. The necessity of a redox mediator to conduce degradation of Methyl Orange could be due to the lack of a phenolic –OH in the vicinity of the azo bond (–N=N–). In contrast, the –OH close to the azo bond in the Xylidine molecule would allow the generation of a phenoxyl radical (Almansa et al. 2004;

Enayatzamir et al. 2009) leading to the degradation of the 
chromophoric structure of the dye through the mechanism we propose in Fig.  5.
While the degradation of azo dyes has been extensively 
studied using cultures of a wide range of fungi and bacte-ria, work carried out using their purified enzymes is more limited. Table  3 summarizes the reports proposing a possi-
ble mechanism for the degradation of azo dyes obtained by using either a purified laccase as the sole enzyme or a culture fraction with laccase among other enzymatic activities. Pos-sible degradation pathways for Methyl Orange were reported for fungal laccases (Telke et al. 2010; Mishra et al. 2011; Levin et al. 2012) as well as for the bacterium Aeromonas  
sp. DH-6 (Du et al. 2014). In this last case laccase as well as NADH-DCIP reductase and azo reductase activities con-tributed to azo dye degradation. Generally, the azoreductase catalyzes the initial step of bacterial azo degradation (reduc-tive cleavage of the azo bond) and laccase is involved in the oxidation of sulfonated azo dyes. In the case of Aeromonas  
sp. DH-6, aromatic amines were obtained as intermediates in the biodegradation of Methyl Orange. As far as we know, these mechanisms have not been reported for purified bac-terial laccases up to now. LAC_2.9 activity involved asym-metric cleavage of the azo bond obtaining p -hydroxyben-
zenesulfonate and p -N,N′- dimethylamine phenyldiazine as 
degradation products, which resemble those obtained by fungal laccases (Telke et al. 2010; Mishra et al. 2011; Levin et al. 2012). In this work, we show that a purified bacterial 
laccase could catalyze the decolorization of Methyl Orange without generation of aromatic amines. Additionally, we pre-sent insights into the mechanism of purified laccase action on the azo dye Xylidine. Culture filtrates from the white rot fungus Trametes trogii  displaying laccase, Mn-peroxi -
dase and cellobiose dehydrogenase activities were used for Xylidine decolorization and biodegradation products were determined (Levin et al. 2012). The same intermediaries 
were observed after LAC_2.9 treatment demonstrating that it catalyzes Xylidine degradation without the requirement of extra enzymes.
There are few reports on the detoxification of textile 
effluents with laccases, and no strict association was found between decolorization and detoxification (Adedayo et al. 2004; Anastasi et al. 2011; Legerská et al. 2018). The deg-radation of azo-dyes might generate compounds of increased toxicity (Zaharia and Suteu 2012). Toxicity changes after 
LAC_2.9 decolorization must still be evaluated. Neverthe -
less, recent decolorization studies involving bacterial lac -
cases proved their ability to detoxify several azo dyes (Blán-quez et al. 2019; Lade et al. 2015; Molina-Guijarro et al. 
2009; Pereira et al. 2009; Xia et al. 2019).Conclusions
There is growing interest in assessing the potential of bacte-rial laccases for industrial and environmental applications especially in hostile conditions. LAC_2.9 laccase from Ther -
mus sp. 2.9 was capable of partially decolorizing chemically diverse dyes such as the azoic Xylidine and Methyl Orange, the antraquinonic RBBR, and the triphenylmethane Gentian Violet, without the addition of redox mediators even at pH 9 and 60 °C. Due to the thermal properties of LAC_2.9 and its tolerance to alkaline pHs and high heavy metals con-centrations, this enzyme could be used in the decoloriza -
tion of textile effluents, a process usually performed at high temperature (> 55 °C) and neutral/alkaline pH. Degradation 
pathways are suggested for the action of LAC_2.9 on Xyli-dine and Methyl Orange azo dyes, not reported for purified bacterial laccases previously.
