 Abstract  
Background : Evidence relating heterocyclic aromatic amines (HCA), associated with 
high-temperature cooking methods, to prostate cancer risk is inconsistent  
Methods : In a large US cohort study, intakes of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5 -
b]pyridine (PhIP), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-a mino-
3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx) and a meat-derived mutagen icity 
index (MDM) were assessed using a cooking method questionnaire administered in 
1996.  Until 2010, 2,770 prostate cancer cases were observed among 26,030 
participants.  
Results : Intake of PhIP from red meat was statistically significantly associated with 
total prostate cancer risk (top vs. bottom quintile HR=1.18, 95% CI 1.03-1.35), but not 
other HCAs (MeIQx, 1.12, 0.98-1.27, PhIP from white meat, 1.07, 0.94-1.21, DiMeIQx, 
1.09, 0.97-1.21) or MDM (1.13, 1.00-1.28). For high grade (Gleason sum 7 with pattern 
4+3 and Gleason sum 8-10, n=483 cases) and advanced cancers (n=281), w e only 
observed positive associations for PhIP from red meat (top vs. bottom quintile: hig h 
grade: HR=1.44, 95% CI 1.04-1.98, p-trend=0.03; advanced: HR=1.50 , 95% 0.99-2.26; 
p-trend=0.12), but associations for advanced cancers did not reach statistical 
significance . Observed associations remained similar after adjustment for total, 
unprocessed or processed red meat intake.  
Conclusion. Observed positive associations between PhIP intake from red meat and 
prostate cancer, particularly high-grade and possibly also advanced prostate cancer 
need to be confirmed in other studies. 
Impact . Results do not provide strong evidence that HCAs increase risk of prostate 
cancers.5 
 Introduction 
Higher meat, especially red meat consumption has been suggested to be associated 
with higher risk of prostate cancer, but the evidence is not consistent (reviewed  in (1)). 
One possible mechanism through which red meat may be involved in prostate 
carcinogenesis is the formation of mutagenic heterocyclic amines (HCA) in muscle 
meat when meats are cooked at high temperature and for long duration (e.g. grilling, 
barbecuing, frying, and broiling) (2).  
 
HCAs were first detected in the 1970s in smoke condensate of grilled fish and were 
shown to be mutagenic (3) . HCAs are formed from precursors (creatine/creatinine, 
sugar, amino acids) found in the muscle of meat and fish cooked at tempe ratures 
exceeding 130°C (4, 5). HCA production and amount depend mainly on cooking 
method, temperature, and the type of meat or fish (4). Meat drippings and gravy made 
from these drippings contain considerable amounts of HCA (6). The most abundant 
HCAs in the human diet are 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyri dine (PhIP), 
2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-3,4,8-
trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx) (7). 
 
Thus far, five cohort studies have examined the association between HCA intak e and 
prostate cancer risk . Some reported positive associations for red meat that was 
consumed mostly well-done (8-10) or for HCA intake (10), in particular with advanced 
disease. Two found no associations (11, 12). In addition, three (13-15) of five (16, 17) 
case-control studies reported no clear associations between HCA intake and risk of 
prostate cancer. 6 
  
The aim of this study was to examine in the PSA era the association of HCA intake and 
a meat-derived mutagenicity (MDM) index with risk of prostate cancer in a large 
prospective US cohort study. 
 
Material and Methods 
Study population 
The Health Professionals Follow-up Study includes 51,529 dentists, veterinarians, 
pharmacists, optometrists, osteopathic physicians, and podiatrists who were between 
40 and 75 years of age at enrollment in 1986. At baseline, all participants completed a 
131-item semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and provided 
information on age, race or ethnicity, weight, height, physical activity, cigarette 
smoking, alcohol consumption, and medical history. Every two years questionn aires 
were mailed to collect updated information on exposure and new diagnoses; follow- up 
FFQs were mailed every four years. The validity and reproducibility of our FFQs have 
been documented previously (18) . Deaths were reported by next- of-kin, the postal 
service, and searches of the National Death Index. The study was approved by the 
Human Subjects Committee at the Harvard School of Public Health. 
 
In 1996, questions on meat preparation (cooking method and degree of donen ess) 
were included on the biennial questionnaire. This analysis is based on the cohort o f 
men who provided information on meat preparation in 1996 and who responded to  the 
1994 FFQ. Of these participants, we excluded all men with a cancer diagnosis except 
for non-melanoma skin cancer prior to 1996 and men with missing information on me at 7 
 preparation (no answer to any of the cooking method questions, missing frequency of 
meat intake of at least one cooked meat item, or no information on bacon con sumption, 
which is needed to estimate HCA intake). The final cohort for this analysis included 
23,030 men.  
 
Case ascertainment 
On the biennial follow-up questionnaires, men were asked to report whether they we re 
diagnosed with prostate cancer, in the previous two years. Diagnosis was confirmed by 
review of medical records (>90% of the cases). For non-responders, we used 
information from the National Death Index, postal service and next- of-kin to determine 
whether a participant had died. After the review of death certificates, informed conse nt 
was obtained from next- of-kin of participants who died of prostate cancer to obtain 
medical records. Study investigators reviewed the medical records to confirm a prostat e 
cancer diagnosis and prostate cancer deaths .  
 
This analysis was based on 2770 non-T1a prostate cancer cases ascertained after the 
date of return of the 1996 questionnaire through January 31st, 2010. Of these cancer 
cases, 281 were classified as advanced or lethal (diagnosed at an advanced stage 
[T3b, T4, N1, and M1], developed metastases during follow- up, or died due to prostate 
cancer). We confirmed 2285 cases as organ-confined or having limited extraprosta tic 
extension (T1b, T1c, T2, T3a and N0 or Nx and M0), and the remainder could not be 
assigned a stage. We defined low-grade prostate cancer as patients having Gleason 
sum of 2-6 or 7 with a pattern of 3 plus 4 (n=1859) and high-grade cases as those with 
Gleason sum 7 and pattern of 4 plus 3 and those with Gleason sum 8-10 (n=483). 8 
  
Assessment of meat consumption and cooking methods 
Total, red (processed and unprocessed), and white meat intake was estimated from the 
1994 FFQ. For each food item, a commonly used unit or serving size was specified. 
The participants were asked to indicate how often, on average, they consumed each 
food item, with nine possible response categories ranging from ‘never’ to ‘six or more 
times per day’. In 1996, participants completed a cooking methods questionnaire based 
on the results of a pilot study, which ascertained a group of cooking method questions 
that best predicted HCA intake in the HPFS (7) . Information on cooking methods and 
typical outside appearance of pan-fried, broiled, and grilled or barbecued chicke n, 
hamburger, and steak; fried, microwaved, and broiled bacon; fried sausag e; roast beef; 
and homemade gravy were assessed (7). Based on results of the pilot study, variatio n 
in doneness level of fried bacon was small. Therefore, fried bacon intake was ba sed on 
the 1994 FFQ and assumed to be medium browned (7). The Charred Database (19 ) 
contains data on HCA and MDM concentration in various meat items depending on 
cooking method and outside appearance (20) . The mutagenic activity of meat samples 
was assessed by the Ames/Salmonella test. The resulting MDM is a measure of th e 
total mutagenic activity found in cooked meats, which integrates mutagenic activity from  
all classes of mutagens, including heterocyclic amines, but also benzo[a]pyrene or yet 
unidentified compounds, found in cooked meats (21).  
A participant’s HCA  intake or MDM was calculated by multiplying the given 
consumption frequency of each food by its HCA content or MDM value for the spe cified 
cooking method and degree of browning derived from the Charred Database (20).   
 9 
 Statistical analysis 
Intake of PhIP, MeIQx, DiMeIQx, and MDM index was categorized into quintiles base d 
on the distribution in the analytic cohort. We calculated hazard ratios ( HR) and 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) using Cox proportional hazards regression 
to evaluate the association of HCA intake and MDM index with total and advanced o r 
lethal prostate cancer. We observed no violation of the proportional hazards 
assumption. The models were adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, pack-years smoked in 
the past ten years, family history of prostate cancer, updated history of diabete s 
mellitus, height, body mass index at age 21, updated vigorous leisure-time physical 
activity, updated current aspirin use, cumulative average updated intake of tom ato 
products and fish, and updated intake of energy, alcohol, vitamin E, -linolenic acid, 
and total calcium. We decided on this set of confounders a priori based on  the overall 
literature. Cumulative updated average intake represents the average intake of a foo d 
or nutrient from all available FFQs up to the start of each follow-up interval (22). To test 
whether associations between HCA intake or MDM index might be explained by meat 
intake per se , we ran models that additionally adjusted for (a) total red meat, (b) 
unprocessed red meat (which includes regular hamburger; lean or extra-lean 
hamburger; beef, pork, or lamb as a sandwich or mixed dish (e.g., stew, casserole, 
lasagna, etc.); beef or lamb as a main dish (e.g., steak, roast, ham, etc.); pork as a 
main dish (e.g., ham or chops)), (c) processed red meat salami, bologna, or other 
processed meat sandwiches; other processed meats (e.g., sausage, kielbasa, etc.); 
bacon; hot dogs), and (d) white meat (chicken and turkey). We also examined the 
association of total red meat, unprocessed red meat, processed red meat and white 10 
 meat consumption in 1994 (closest date to HCA assessment in 1996) and the risk of 
prostate cancer. To test for trend, we entered the median of each quintile of HC A intake 
or MDM index as a single continuous variable into the model and used the Wald t est to 
assess statistical significance of the coefficient . We ran stratified models to determine if 
the associations of HCA intake or MDM index with prostate cancer varied by age (<60 
vs. ≥ 60 years in 1996), current body mass index, aspirin use (non-users in 1996 vs. 
user; infrequent vs. frequent user; never user vs. user), consumption of tomato 
products (sum of tomato sauce and pizza; < vs. ≥ 2.0 servings/week), intake of vitamin 
E (< vs. ≥ median intake), and history of prostatitis. In a sensitivity analysis, we 
restricted the analysis to men who have had at least one PSA test until the end o f the 
observation period in 2010. The presence of multiplicative interaction was assessed by  
including a cross-product term for these factors and HCA intake or MDM index in the 
regression model along with the main effect terms. The statistical significance of the 
coefficient for the cross-product term was evaluated by the Wald test. A p-value of 
<0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
 
Results 
The analysis included 2770 prostate cancer cases in 314,746 person-years of follo w-
up. Selected baseline characteristics of the study participants by highest and lowest 
category of PhIP, MeIQx, and DiMeIQx intake are shown in Table 1. Participan ts in the 
highest categories engaged less often in vigorous physical activity and were more likely 
to have smoked in the past 10 years. These participants also had a higher intake o f red 
meat, but lower intake of vitamin E than participants in the lowest quintiles.  
 11 
 Intake of PhIP from red meat was statistically significantly associated with total prostate 
cancer risk (multivariable HR=1.18, 95% CI 1.03-1.35, top vs. bottom quintile; Table 2) . 
However, intake of PhIP from white meat or intake of MeIQx, DiMeIQx or the MDM 
index were not associated with total prostate cancer risk (Table 2). For high grade 
cancers (Gleason sum 7 with pattern 4+3 and Gleason sum 8- 10, n=483 cases), we 
also observed an increased risk among participants with high intake of PhIP from red 
meat (HR=1.44, 95% CI 1.04-1.98 , p-trend=0.03), but we d id not observe any 
significant associations with MDM index (HR=1.05, 95% CI 0.78-1.41, p-trend=0.54), 
MeIQx, PhIP from white meat or DiMeIQx.  
 
For advanced cancers (n=281) we only observed positive associations for PhIP from 
red meat (top vs. bottom quintile: HR: 1.50 (95% 0.99-2.26; p-trend=0.12), but 
associations for advanced cancers did not reach statistical significance (Table 2). HCA 
intake or MDM index were not statistically significantly associated with the risk of organ-
confined or low-grade prostate cancer (data not shown). 
 
Adding total red meat intake to the multivariable model did not materially change the 
associations between HCA intake or MDM index with total, advanced and high-grade 
prostate (data not shown); results were als o similar after adding unprocessed red meat 
or processed meat separately to the models (data not shown) . Similarly, no major 
changes were observed when adding white meat to the model . In order to evaluate 
whether the effect on high-grade and advanced tumors was due to HCA or other 
carcinogens in cooked meat, we included both MDM and PhIP from red meat in to the 
same model; but the risk estimates for PhIP from red meat were similar (top vs. bottom 12 
 quintile , HR, 95% CI; high grade: PhIP from red meat 1.50; 1.06-2.14 ; MDM 0.90, 0.65-
1.23; advanced: PhIP from red meat 1.45, 0.92-2.28; MDM 1.17, 0.76-1.81) .  
Generally, the associations of HCA intake or MDM index with total prostate cancer 
were not modified by age, BMI, aspirin use, vitamin E intake, or history of prostatitis (all 
p-interaction > 0.05; data not shown). However, we observed an increased risk of total 
prostate cancer associated with high HCA intake or MDM index among those with 
lower (but not higher) consumption of tomato products; however interactions were not  
statistically significant, except for MDM (p-interaction=0.03; Table 3). Excluding men 
who had never had a PSA test did not change our results appreciably (data not shown).  
In joint analysis we observed that men with both low tomato consumption and high  
MDM had a 22% (95% CI 2%-47%) higher risk of developing prostate cancer when 
compared to those with high tomato consumption and low MDM (data not shown ).  
 
Discussion 
In this large prospective cohort study conducted in the PSA era, we did not observe 
statistically significant associations between HCA intake and risk of prostate cancer. 
However, we observed positive associations between PhIP intake from red mea t and 
risk of total, high grade and advanced prostate cancer . Also, we noted that men with 
low tomato product consumption had an increased risk of total prostate cancer 
associated with intake of some HCA s or the MDM index, whereas no increased risks 
were observed among men with high tomato product consumption. 
 13 
 Heterocyclic amines have consistently been shown to be mutagenic in mutagenicity 
assays and carcinogenic in animal models (23, 24). PhIP contributes most to HCA 
intake in the US, whereas DiMeIQx intake is comparably low, but is the most mutagenic 
HCA of the three examined HCAs (25). Epidemiologic evidence for an association 
between HCA intake and prostate cancer, however, is limited. In the most recent study , 
conducted among participants of the California Collaborative Prostate Cancer Study 
(16), high consumption of red meat cooked at high temperature and well done red m eat 
were positively associated with risk of advanced, but not overall prostate cancer. Intake 
of PhIP was also positively, although not statistically significantly related with advanced 
prostate cancer. This result is similar to what has been reported in the NIH-AARP 
cohort (8). High intake of very well done meat and of PhIP were associated with a n 
increased risk of prostate cancer in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer 
Screening Trial (10). In the Agricultural Health Study (9), consumption of well or very  
well done meat was related to an increased risk of total and in particular advanced 
prostate cancer, and there were non-statistically significant positive associations with 
DiMeIQx and MeIQx intakes. In the Multiethnic Cohort (11) and the EPIC-Heidelberg 
cohort (12), no associations of HCA intake or type of meat cooking or degree of 
doneness with risk of prostate cancer overall or with advanced disease were observ ed. 
In two case-control studies HCA intake was not clearly associated with prostate cancer 
risk (13- 15), although another study by John et al. (13) reported a positive association 
of well done and grilled red meat consumption with risk of advanced prostate cance r. A 
fourth case-control study including 470 cases of aggressive prostate cancer related 
high intake of well done meat and intake of MeIQx and DiMeIQx to an increased  risk 
(17). 14 
  
It is of interest to note that we observed associations between PhIP intake from red but 
not from white meat with risk of high-grade prostate cancer, although PhIP intake f rom 
white meat is twice as high as the intake from red meat. In addition, associations for 
PhIP from red meat remained similar after we adjusted for total, unprocessed and  
processed meat intake separately . This argues against a causal association between 
PhIP intake (or HCA intake in general) and prostate cancer risk, and suggest the 
possibility that not HCA themselves but other mutagenic compounds that arise fro m 
cooking of red meat may also be a risk factor for prostate cancer. MDM integrates 
mutagenic activity of different compounds in cooked meats such as heterocyclic amines 
or benzo[a]pyrene, but also yet unidentified compounds (21).  However, w hen we 
examined associations between PhIP from red meat and MDM and high grad e or 
advanced cancers in the same model estimates for PhIP from red meat were simila r to 
estimates without MDM in the model .  
In the rat, PhIP induced mutations in the ventral prostate, which was associated with an 
infiltrate of inflammatory cells (26). Similarly, PhIP induced prostate cancer in a CY P1A-
humanized mice model, which is preceded by inflammatory proliferative epithelial 
lesions (27). In our analysis, we did not observe evidence for effect modification  of the 
association between HCA intake or MDM index and prostate cancer risk by use of 
aspirin, intake of dietary vitamin E, or BMI, all of which are factors that influence 
inflammatory processes. We did, however, observe that associations were modified by  
consumption of tomato products. Lycopene is a potent antioxidant found in toma toes 
(28), but the mechanism by which lycopene may modify the association of HCA intake 
and prostate cancer is currently unclear. Animal studies did not provide clear evidence 15 
 that administration of lycopene reduced formation of HCA-DNA adducts, reduced 
oxidative stress induced by HCA administration, or influenced levels of phase- II 
enzymes (29, 30). However, lycopene may affect cell cycle, apoptosis, inflammation, 
and angiogenesis by a variety of pathways (31, 32). To the best of ou r knowledge, this 
is the first study to observe a modifying effect of tomato intake on risk of prostat e 
cancer and, thus, our results need to be confirmed by other studies. However, we 
cannot exclude the possibility that our results are due to chance and, thus, warra nt 
confirmation from other studies. 
 
We observed positive associations of PhIP intake from red meat with total, high grade  
and advanced prostate cancer; even though associations for advanced cancers di d not 
reach statistical significance. However, the number of advanced or lethal cases in our 
analytical cohort was small because we began follow-up in 1996 after the complet ion of 
the questionnaire, i.e., in the PSA era; about 95% of men included in our an alysis had 
reported at least one PSA between 1996 until the end of the follow-up  period. Other 
studies that had reported associations of HCA intake with advanced prostate cancer (9, 
13, 16, 17) did not separately evaluate high-grade disease .  
 
We assessed meat cooking habits in 1996 and used that information throughout follow-
up. It is possible that participants might have changed their meat preparation habits or 
overall meat intake during follow-up, which may result in another source of 
measurement error. For example, red meat consumption decreased in the HPFS ove r 
time. In 2004, we assessed meat cooking methods a second time in the HPFS cohort 
and correlations between calculated HCA intake in 1996 and 2004 were r=0.31, 0.40, 16 
 and 0.23 (all p-values < 0.0001) for PhIP, MeIQx, and DiMeIQx, respectively. HC A 
intake estimations suffer from imprecision. Assessing a person’s dietary intake by 
means of a FFQ is prone to recall bias due to over- or underestimation of dietary intake 
by the study participant leading to misclassification with respect to dietary intake. We 
estimated HCA intake and MDM index based on participants’ responses to questions 
on the cooking method of specific meat items. Doneness levels specified by 
participants are proxies of the actual intake of heterocyclic amines, which varies by 
duration of cooking, temperatures used (33), type of oil used (34, 35), handlin g of the 
meat before and during the cooking process (36) as well as of the cooking method itself  
(37) such that cooking short time by high temperature and long time by lower 
temperature can result in the same degree of browning but not in the same degree of 
doneness. In addition, the use of limited data on the HCA content in diffe rently 
prepared meats for the computation of HCA intake is another major shortcoming of this 
approach to quantify intake (38). However, the cooking questions used in this stu dy are 
based on a pilot study (7) that determined which set of questions best pred icted HCA 
intake in our cohorts. Also, because data on cooking methods were obtained prior to 
cancer diagnosis, possible measurement errors due to the aforementioned factors 
should be non-differential, which tends to attenuate associations.  
In conclusion, our results do not provide strong evidence that HCAs in general increase 
risk of prostate cancers. Observed associations between PhIP intake from red me at 
and prostate cancer, particularly high-grade and possibly also advanced prostate 
cancer need to be confirmed in other studies.
