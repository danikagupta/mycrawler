Abstract - Soil microcosms seeded with spores of a tracer organism ( Bacillus subtilis  strain PB5332) were used to test five different 
DNA extraction protocols hereby indicated as A, B, C, D and E. The representativity of DNA samples obtained from each procedure was 
evaluated by PCR amplification of the swrAA gene, unique to PB5332 strain, followed by Southern hybridization with a gene-specific 
probe. A significant improvement of DNA extraction from spores was obtained using grinding under liquid N2 associated with sodium-
dodecyl sulphate (SDS)-based lysis in presence of 1% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB; protocol C). The same procedure was tested on soil samples from two distinct greenhouse trials carried out with genetically modified white poplars ( Populus alba L.) 
expressing the StSy gene for resveratrol production and the bar gene for Basta  tolerance, respectively. The representativity of DNA 
samples recovered from the greenhouse soil was assessed using three spore-forming bacteria (SFB) as tracer organisms. The trace rs 
(SFB-1, SFB-2 and SFB-3) were previously isolated from the same trials classified as members of the genus Bacillus. All the tested 
DNA samples produced the expected amplification products, indicating the presence at the soil level of the tracers and confirming the reliability of the optimized DNA extraction protocol.

INTRODUCTION
The fate of recombinant DNA sequences released by 
genetically modified plants in the soil environment has become the subject for extensive experimental work (Bruinsma et al., 2003; Levy-Booth et al., 2007). Although 
relevant progress has been achieved in the use of molecular techniques with environmental samples, working with soil is still difficult due to the presence of contaminants that are co-extracted with DNA. Routine techniques for soil DNA extraction and purification need to be further optimized for a more comprehensive study of the fate of plant recombinant DNA and of the DNA cycle in the soil environment. Contaminants, such as humic acids, polysaccharides or urea, show equal solubility properties compared to DNA and therefore their complete removal is impaired in classical extraction protocols (Lakay et al., 
2007).
 Since less than 1% of the total soil-associated microbial populations can be cultured under laboratory conditions (Malik et al., 2008), cultivation-independent methods have been devel-
oped, which use the total DNA extracted from soil samples (Tyson and Banfield, 2005). Furthermore, a variable fraction of the soil microorganisms is found in the form of endospores, which are generally considered as the hardiest among cell types, able to easily escape treatments for DNA extraction. To date, optimized methods allowing the recovery of nucleic acids from recalcitrant structures are needed for different purposes, among which the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (GM) plants.
 Kuske et al. (1998) used different soils seeded 
with Bacillus globigii  endospores to test the efficiency 
of an hot-detergent lysis treatment followed by bead mill homogeneization. The lowest spore concentration detected corresponded to 14 copies of the B. globigii genome. A similar procedure, based on the use of a bead mill homogenizer followed by 1% CTAB extraction, was reported by Williamson et al. (1999) who recovered DNA from sediment sample inoculated with dilutions of Clostridium  spore suspensions. PCR amplification of the 
expected product was successful in sediment inoculated with 25 or more spores. More recently, concerns about the use of pathogens for bioterrorism has prompted extensive studies on the traceability of vegetative cells and spores in soil environment (Saikaly et al., 2007).
 In our microcosm-based study, Bacillus subtilis , a common 
inhabitant of soil environments (Nagorska et al., 2007), was 
used as tracer organism. The PB5332 strain ( pheA- swrAA+ sfp+) 
has been intensively studied since these cells show a typical swarming phenotype (Senesi et al., 2004). This trait is depend- * Corresponding Author . Phone: +390382985435;

ent on the swrAA+ mutation and the spreading of the bacteria 
is facilitated by the production of surfactin, a biosurfactant that 
reduces the surface tension. Hyper-flagellated swarmer cells from the PB5332 strain secrete surfactin and create a motile film that allows the bacterial population to colonize large areas. The swarming behaviour positively affects the ability of certain soil bacteria to colonize plants (Daniels et al., 2004). The swrAA  
gene product, required for swarming in B. subtilis, was found 
to enhance transcription of flagellar genes (Kearns and Losick, 2005), a trait probably required for the hyperflagellated phe-notype displayed by swarmer cells. In a recent work, Osera et 
al. (2009) reported that swrAA activates poly-gammaglutamate synthesis in B. subtilis. Since the swrAA gene has no homologs 
in any other sequenced genome, apart from B. subtilis and its 
close relatives Bacillus licheniformis , Bacillus pumilus  and Bacillus 
amyloliquefaciens , it represents the ideal target for specific 
amplifications, circumventing the problem of cross-reaction with other common soil organisms. In the present work, the attention was focused on a soil, 
classified as sandy loam and commonly found in the Southern part of Lombardy (Italy), which well supports poplar growth. This soil has been used for the cultivation of transgenic white pop-lars engineered with the StSy gene from Vitis vinifera and with 
the bar gene from Streptomyces hygroscopicus, respectively, in 
greenhouse trials (Balestrazzi et al., 2007, 2008, 2009a, 2009b; 
Bonadei et al., 2009). In the GM poplars expressing the StSy gene 
encoding stilbene synthase, responsible for resveratrol biosynthe-sis, the amount of resveratrol-like compounds was in the range 180-210 mg kg 
-1 fresh leaf tissue (Balestrazzi et al., 2009b). As 
for the herbicide-tolereant poplars, the genetically modified pop-lars were tolerant to intense and repeated glufosinate ammonium treatments, maintaining an intact shoot sprouting and a good height increment (Balestrazzi et al., unpublished data). 
 We present an improved protocol for DNA extraction/purifica-tion, suitable for the molecular investigation of the soil microbial populations. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Microcosm experiments. The soil used in this study was 
classified as a medium textured loamy sand (77.43% sand, 
16.93% silt and 5.62% clay; 24.58% organic matter; 62% Water Holding Capacity) with pH 6.85. Soil samples were col-lected and processed as previously described (Balestrazzi et al., 2008). Two distinct microcosm experiments were designed as follows: 5 g of soil were transferred to 50-mL sterile tubes and mixed with a suspension containing 10
4 and 108 cells derived 
from an exponentially growing culture of the Bacillus subtilis  
PB5332 strain (pheA1-swrAA+sfp+) (Senesi et al., 2004). A 
parallel microcosm was established using 50-mL sterile tubes in which 5 g of soil were mixed with a suspension containing 10
4 and 108 spores obtained from the same B. subtilis strain. 
In order to obtain sporulation, cells were seeded in SM medium (Nakano et al., 1988) supplemented with 10 μM MnCl
2, 1 mM 
Ca(NO3)2 and 1 μM FeSO4 and the culture was allowed to 
sporulate by 48 h-incubation at 37 °C under shaking. Spores were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in sterile dis-tilled H
2O, treated with Lysozyme (300 μg mL-1, Sigma-Aldrich) 
and with DNase I (1 mg mL-1, Sigma-Aldrich). Finally, spores 
were washed with 0.1% Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate (SDS), repeatedly rinsed with sterile distilled H
2O and stored at 4 °C. 
Spore number and viability was determined by plating progres-sive dilutions (10
-6, 10-9, 10-10) of the spore suspension on NB medium (Difco) and incubating for 30 min at room tem-perature. For each microcosm, three replicates were analyzed while three independent microcosm-based experiments were carried out. 
DNA extraction. Different DNA extraction procedures were 
tested in the present study using soil microcosms seeded with spores of a tracer organism (Bacillus subtilis  strain PB5332) 
(Senesi et al., 2004). DNA extraction from soil samples was 
carried out using the following protocols: A) the method described by Zhou et al. (1996) which requires the SDS (2%)-
based lysis at high temperature (60 °C) in the presence of 1% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB); B) the same procedure used in A with an increased CTAB concentration (4%); C) the same procedure used in A but the soil sample was grinded under liquid N
2, before incubation in the lysis buffer; 
D) microwave-based thermal shock (600-700 W, 1 min) in presence of high concentrations of SDS (3%) and polyvinylpyr-rolidone (PVP, 1.2%, Sigma-Aldrich) as described by Orsini and Romano-Spica (2001); E) a combined protocol including grind-ing under liquid N2 and the microwave-based thermal shock as described for protocol D.  Crude DNAs were subsequently purified using the GFX
TM 
PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the supplied protocol. This step was repeated once more and finally the purified DNA was collected and stored at -20 °C. For each protocol, three independent DNA extractions (corresponding to the three independent microcosm-based experiments) were carried out. Each DNA extraction was always performed with three replicated samples. DNA quantita-tion was carried out by means of spectrophotometric analyses combined with evaluation by agarose gel electrophoresis.
Molecular analyses.  PCR and Southern blot hybridization 
analyses were carried out to amplify and detect the swrAA  
gene, using standard procedures (Sambrook et al., 1989). 
Oligonucleotides YVZD-1 and YVZD-2 (Table 1) were used at 
the following conditions: 94 °C 30 s, 47 °C 30 s, 72 °C 30 s (5 cycles) and 94 °C 30 s, 55 °C 30 s, 72 °C 30 s (20 cycles) (Calvio et al., 2005). For each Spore Forming Bacterium (SFB) 
isolate, PCR amplification of the 16S rDNA sequence was carried out using the following specific oligonucleotide primers: SFB1-FW and SFB1-RV, SFB2-FW and SFB2-RV, SFB3-FW and SFB3-RV (Table 1) (Bonadei et al., submitted for publication). The 
following conditions were used for SFB-1 and SFB-2: 94 °C for 5 min (1 cycle), 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min (35 cycles). In the case of SFB-3 the annealing temperature was 52 °C. Sequencing of PCR products was performed using an ABI PRISM
 BigDyeTM Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction 
Kit, according to manufacturer’s indications and the ABI PRISM 
310 Genetic Analyzer (Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystems).
RESULTS
Detection of the swrAA gene in soil microcosms seeded 
with Bacillus subtilis  cells and spores 
DNAs were extracted from microcosms carrying 108 bacterial 
cells and evaluated by PCR in order to serch for the tracer 
gene swrAA (Fig. 1A). For each PCR reaction, the same tem-
plate amount (30 ng) was used in the same volume (3 μL). Significant differences were observed in the efficiency of prod-uct amplification. The DNA sample obtained with procedure A produced a faint signal, quantified by densitometric analysis Ann. Microbiol., 59 (4), 827-832 (2009) 829
as 10% of the highest signal (Fig. 1A, lane A). The hybridiza-
tion signal produced by DNA extracted with protocol B (Fig. 1A, lane B) showed an higher intensity. The best performance was obtained with protocol C which uses the SDS-based lysis with 1% CTAB coupled to grinding under liquid N
2 (Fig. 1A, 
lane C). The intensity of this hybridization signal was similar to that produced by a PCR assay performed with 0.75 ng of B. 
subtilis DNA template, corresponding to 10
8 bacterial genomes 
(data not shown). This means an efficiency close to 100%. Low PCR efficiencies were found for the microwave-based protocol D and E (Fig. 1A, lanes D and E). In this case the intensity of hybridization signals corresponded to 20 and 5% of the high-est signal, respectively. Densitometric analysis allowed precise quantitation for each hybridization signal and the resulting data were use to calculate the relative amount compared with the highest value observed (Fig. 1A, lane C). The same response was observed using soil microcosms with 10
4 cells. In this case 
the hybridization signals were lower, as expected, with protocol A, B and C but it was not possible to detect the swrAA sequence 
with protocols D and E (data not shown). Protocol C, the most effective, was selected for further experiments performed on soil microcosms seeded with 10
4 and 108 B. subtilis spores. In 
addition, protocol E was also tested, with the idea that recal-citrant microbial structures might require a more robust treat-ment. The amount of B. subtilis DNA in each soil microcosm 
was calculated to be 428.65 x 10
3 pg (108 spores) and 42.86 
pg (104 spores), respectively. When considering protocol C, 
which allowed to recover an average amount of total soil DNA corresponding to 17 ± 0.89 μg, it was estimated that 756.44 pg (corresponding to 176.46 x 10
3 copies of the B. subtilis 
genome) was the amount of target DNA contained in a 30 ng-aliquot of the template. This was the case of the microcosm containing 10
8 B. subtilis spores. For the microcosms seeded 
with 104 B. subtilis spores, the calculated DNA amount found in 
30 ng was 0.075 pg (17.4 copies of the B. subtilis genome). If 
protocol C is supposed to result into the highest yield (close to 100%), the swrAA gene is expected to produce an hybridization 
signal similar to that obtained with 756 and 0.075 pg of purified PB5332 DNA, respectively. The hybridization signal obtained from soil microcosms seeded with 10
8 B. subtilis spores, using 
DNA extracted with protocol C are shown in Fig. 1B (lane 1). The comparison between this signals and the hybridization TABLE 1 - Oligonucleotide primer sets usedin PCR reactions

band produced with the soil microcosms seeded with an equal 
amount (108) of B. subtilis cells (Fig. 1A, lane C) clearly dem-
onstrated that the efficiency of DNA extraction from spores was impared, using protocol C. The intensity of the hybridization bands was remarkably reduced (at least 8-fold). This dem-onstrated that a low lysis efficiency in the case of recalcitrant structures such as the B. subtilis spores was associated with 
the use of protocol C. However the presence of the swrAA gene was still detectable in microcosms containing 10
4 spores (Fig. 
1B, lane 2). As previously calculated, a single PCR assay carried out with these microcosms contains approximately 17 copies of the B. subtilis genome and consequently, this was the resolu-
tion threshold of our experimental conditions. Protocol E did not allow a more efficient detection of the target gene, when used with soil microcosms seeded with spores. In this case, the intensity of the hybridization signal obtained with microcosms seeded with 10
8 spores (Fig. 1C, lane 1) was similar to that pro-
duced with 108 cells (Fig. 1A, lane E) and significantly reduced 
(approximately 4-fold) compared to the signal obtained with 10
8 spores using protocol C (Fig. 1B, lane 1). This suggests 
that the combination of different physical treatments (grinding under N
2 plus microwave-based heat shock) was not effec-
tive, leading to limited spore disruption. Moreover, when using protocol E, the PCR-Southern hybridization failed to reveal the expected product with microcosms seeded with 10
4 spores 
(Fig. 1C, lane 2). Control samples used for each microcosm without B. subtilis cells, always produced negative results, 
thus indicating the specificity of the different oligonucleotide primers (data not shown). In the case of procedures A, B and C, the total amount of DNA extracted from each microcosm, quantified by spectrophotometric analysis and evaluation on agarose gel, varied from 17.5 ± 0.89 to 19.3 ± 0.45 μg, while a strong reduction, approximately 10-fold less (from 1.5 ± 0.05 to 1.9 ± 0.09 μg), was observed when the microwave-based approach was used (procedures D and E). A consistent degree of fragmentation was observed in DNA samples extracted by microwave-based protocols (data not shown). Furthermore it is worth noting that the amplification of the 16S rDNA sequence with universal bacterial oligonucleotides was observed in all the DNA samples, indicating that all the templates were accessible to the Taq Polymerase, independently of the DNA extraction procedure (data not shown).  The reported data suggest that protocol C might represent an efficient procedure for DNA extraction from soil samples.
Detection of SFB isolates in soil cultivated with transgenic 
white poplarsProtocol C was then tested with soil samples previously col-lected from two greenhouse trials established with transgenic white poplars. DNA representativity was assessed using the SFB-1 (DQ988159), SFB-2 (DQ988160) and SFB-3 (DQ988161) isolates as tracer organisms. These environmental isolates, clas-sified as members of the genus Bacillus by 16S rDNA-based 
taxonomy, were recovered from the soil of both greenhouse trials (Bonadei et al., submitted for publication).
 In order to detect the SFB-1, SFB-2 and SFB-3 isolates, PCR analysis was carried out with specific oligonucleotide primer sets designed from the available 16S rDNA sequences. Molecular analyses were carried out on twelve soil pools obtained from the StSy trial and nine soil pools derived from the bar trial. All the 
tested DNA samples produced the expected amplification prod-uct, thus indicating the presence of the SFB isolates in the soil (data not shown). Results from PCR analysis performed on the DNA samples extracted from one out of the twelve StSy pools and one out of the nine bar pools, respectively, are visible in Fig. 
2. The reported data demonstrate that protocol C was effective when applied to the loamy sand cultivated with GM poplars and resulted into acceptable representativity of the culturable SFB population inhabiting the same soil.  
DISCUSSION
Aim of this study was to develop an improved protocol for DNA 
extraction and purification from a humic acid-rich soil used to establish two extensive greenhouse trials with transgenic white poplars (Balestrazzi et al., 2007, 2008, 2009a, 2009b; Bonadei et al., 2009). 
 The efficacy of five protocols in terms of DNA yield and purity was evaluated while attention was focused on the response of recalcitrant microrganisms, particularly the Gram positive bac-teria and spores. Stach et al. (2001) suggested that a greater 
DNA quantity recovered does not always equal a greater species richness, demonstrating that there is always the possibility that extracted DNA might derived from the most easily lysed cells. In the present work, the availability of the B. subtilis  PB5332 strain 
carrying the unique gene swrAA has allowed the investigation on 
the level of representativity deriving from different lysis proce-dures. The level of humic acids in our DNA samples varied before and after purification. Humic substances can compete with nucleic acids for adsorption sites during purification with minicol-umns (Rose-Amsageg et al., 2001). It is very difficult to remove humic acids and phenolic compounds from DNA samples, and therefore only a combination of purification methods can yield DNA of sufficient purity for successful molecular applications (Rose-Amsageg et al., 2001). In our hands, two subsequent 
purification steps were required to obtain successful PCR amplifi-cation which is generally used as an indicator of suitable soil DNA purity (Burgmann et al., 2001). Purification was carried out with columns from a commercial kit containing a chaotropic agent that denatures proteins and promotes the binding of double stranded DNA to a glass fiber matrix. It is worth noting that a strong reduction in DNA yields and a significant DNA fragmentation were observed with the microwave-based thermal shock. Orsini and Romano-Spica (2001) reported that the microwave-based FIG. 2 - Traceability of SFB-1, SFB-2 and SFB-3 isolates in soil 
collected from the bar and StSy greenhouse trials. PCR 
analyses were carried out using the specific oligonucle-otide primer sets SFB1-FW/SFB1-RV, SFB2-FW/SFB2-RV and SFB3-FW/SFB3-RV (lanes SFB 1, 2 and 3). M, Gene Ruler

DNA isolation from soil showed the lowest recovery, compared 
to other environmental samples, however they did not found relevant DNA shearing.  The reported data obtained with soil microcosms confirmed the versatility of the protocol by Zhou et al. (1996) as con-
cern representativity, however a significant improvement was obtained by grinding the soil in the presence of liquid N
2 and 
by increasing the CTAB concentration, which possibly helped to enhance the removal of contaminants, particularly polysaccha-rides. CTAB might be effective in the case of those bacteria pro-ducing extracellular polysaccharides that bind clay particles and form complexes that are maintained in the soil after the death of the microorganisms (Chen, 1998). The increased CTAB con-centration (4%) used in protocol B might enhance the formation and precipitation of insoluble complexes with proteins, polysac-charides and cell debris, resulting in a better quality DNA. In our hands, when grinding under N
2 was added to the lysis procedure 
of Zhou et al. (1996), the detection of a limited copy number (approximately 17) of the target sequence swrAA released from 
bacterial spores became possible. Since the swrAA gene has no homologs in any other 
sequenced genome, apart from B. subtilis and its close rela-
tives Bacillus licheniformis , B. pumilus and B. amyloliquefa-
ciens, it represents the ideal target for specific amplifications, circumventing the problem of cross-reaction with other com-mon soil organisms. This was also supported by the fact that no signal was detected in soil microcosms which did not contain the tracer microorganism. Finally, when the improved procedure was tested on the loamy sand collected from the StSy and bar trials, the SFB isolates previously characterized 
became the tracer organisms and their presence was confirmed by molecular analyses. Differently from the microcosm-based analyses, it is difficult to make a quantitative evaluation for each SFB isolate found in the soil samples from the greenhouse trials. The reported data suggest that the improved procedure hereby described might become a useful tool in future studies aimed at assessing the environmental impact of GM trees by monitoring novel and specific components of the soil microbial communities.
