Taylor & Francis Group, an informa  businessBoca Raton   London   New YorkThe cover illustration depicts the pathway of solar energy captured by photosynthesis to convert atmospheric carbon 
dioxide to biomass that can be used as a feedstock for the thermochemical production of methane. This synthetic natu-
ral gas product is the cleanest burning of all the carbon-based fuels.  Methane made by the biomass pathway is neutral 
with respect to the production of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide because any of that gas generated by combustion of 
biomass-based synthetic natural gas was removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis in producing the biomass 
feedstock.  Biomass-based synthetic fuel production and other sustainable energy technologies are discussed in detail in 
Chapter 19, “Sustainable Energy:  The Key to Everything.”

Environmental Chemistry , ninth edition, maintains much the same organizational structure, level, 
and emphasis that have been developed through preceding editions, with updates in keeping with 
the emerging face of the dynamic science of environmental chemistry. Therefore, rather than enter-
ing into an immediate discussion of a specifi  c environmental problem, such as stratospheric ozone 
depletion, the book systematically develops the concept of environmental chemistry so that, when 
specifi  c pollution problems are discussed, the reader has the background to understand such prob-
lems. Chapters 1 and 2 have been signifi  cantly changed from the eighth edition to provide a better 
perspective on sustainability, environmental science as a whole, chemical fate and transport, cycles 
of matter, the nature of environmental chemistry, and green chemistry. The chapter on terrorism in 
the eighth edition has been removed, but specifi  c aspects of this topic, such as the potential role of 
toxic substances in terrorist attacks, have been placed in other chapters. Because of the importance 
of energy to the environment and sustainability, an extensive new chapter on this topic has been 
added to the book. Separate chapters on basic chemistry and organic chemistry that were in the 
seventh and earlier editions have not been included, but may be obtained from the author or pub-
lisher in pdf format upon request.
The book views the environment as consisting of fi  ve spheres: (1) hydrosphere, (2) atmosphere, 
(3) geosphere, (4) biosphere, and (5) anthrosphere. It emphasizes the importance of the anthrosphere—
that part of the environment made and operated by humans and their technologies. This environ-
mental sphere has so much infl  uence on the Earth and its environmental systems that, according to 
Nobel Prize winner Paul Crutzen, the Earth is leaving the Holocene epoch, throughout which 
humankind has existed on Earth until now and is entering the Anthropocene epoch, in which human 
infl uences, such as emissions of gases that signifi  cantly affect the warming and protective functions 
of the atmosphere, will have a dominant infl  uence on conditions under which humankind exists on 
Earth. Since technology will in fact be used to attempt to support humankind on the planet, it is 
important that the anthrosphere be designed and operated in a manner that is compatible with sus-
tainability and interacts constructively with the other environmental spheres. In this endeavor, envi-
ronmental chemistry has a key role to play.
Environmental chemistry has evolved signifi  cantly since the fi  rst edition of Environmental 
Chemistry  was published in 1972. (One interesting footnote to this evolution has been that with each 
new edition the calculation of the pH of ordinary rainwater has had to be revised because levels of 
atmospheric carbon dioxide had increased enough since each preceding edition to affect the result.) 
Whereas in the early 1970s environmental chemistry dealt largely with pollution and its effects, it 
now has a current emphasis upon sustainability. During the lifetime of the book, problems with 
organochlorine pesticides and detergent phosphates that cause water eutrophication have largely 
disappeared as the manufacture and sale of these substances have essentially ceased. When the 
book was fi  rst published, it was not known with certainty what happened to large quantities of car-
bon monoxide emitted to the atmosphere by automobiles; it was suspected that soil microorganisms 
metabolized this pollutant, but it is now known that the ubiquitous hydroxyl radical scavenges CO 
from the atmosphere. In 1972, the potential for stratospheric ozone depletion was just emerging as 
a major issue, but it was not known that refrigerant chlorofl  uorocarbons (freon compounds) were 
predominantly responsible for this threat. As the book progressed through various editions, the 
threat of these materials was revealed; the southern hemisphere springtime Antarctic ozone hole xxviii  Preface
was discovered, which grew ominously year by year; the manufacture of chlorofl  uorocarbons was 
banned as a consequence; and Molina, Rowland, and Crutzen shared a well-deserved Nobel Prize, 
the fi rst ever in environmental chemistry, for their work in this fi  eld. The potential for greenhouse 
warming due to growing emissions of infrared-capturing carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases 
was shown to be a potentially huge problem for Earth and one that has not yet been resolved. In 
1972, the terms green chemistry and industrial ecology had not yet been coined, but these disci-
plines emerged from the 1990s as crucial elements of environmental chemistry.
Chapter 1 provides an overview and background in environmental and sustainability science. 
The chapter is introduced with a brief discussion of the central issue of our time—energy, “From 
the Sun to Fossil Fuels and Back Again.” This chapter introduces chemical fate and transport, envi-
ronmental terrorism, and environmental forensics.
Chapter 2 defi  nes environmental chemistry and green chemistry in some detail. The chapter 
discusses the important concept of cycles of matter. It introduces the anthrosphere, how it integrates 
with the other environmental spheres, and its effects on Earth. Components of the anthrosphere that 
infl uence the environment are discussed with emphasis on the all-important infrastructure that is 
part of the anthrosphere.
Chapters 3 through 8 deal with the hydrosphere. Chapter 3 introduces the special characteristics 
of water and the environmental chemistry of water. The remaining Chapters 4 through 8 discuss 
specifi  c aspects of aquatic chemistry, aquatic biochemistry, and water sustainability and treatment.
Chapters 9 through 14 discuss atmospheric chemistry. Chapter 14 emphasizes the greatest suc-
cess story of environmental chemistry to date—the study of ozone-depleting chlorofl  uorocarbons, 
which resulted in the fi  rst Nobel Prize being awarded in environmental chemistry as mentioned 
above. It also emphasizes the greenhouse effect, which may be the greatest of all threats to the 
global environment as we know it.
Chapters 15 and 16 deal with the geosphere, the latter chapter emphasizing soil and agricultural 
chemistry. Included in the discussion of agricultural chemistry is the important and controversial 
new area of transgenic crops. Another area discussed is conservation tillage, which makes limited 
use of herbicides to grow crops with minimum soil disturbance.
Chapter 17 goes into detail on the topic of green chemistry and the closely related area of indus-
trial ecology. Chapter 18 discusses resources and sustainable materials.
Chapter 19, on energy, is new as a separate chapter in the ninth edition. Entitled “Sustainable 
Energy: The Key to Everything,” it covers key topics on sustainable energy including conservation 
and renewable sources. The chapter ends with a proposed system of industrial ecology designed to 
produce methane from renewable biofuels and hydrogen generated from the electrolysis of water 
using renewable wind or solar energy.
The nature and environmental chemistry of hazardous wastes are covered in Chapter 20 and 
industrial ecology for waste minimization, utilization, and treatment in Chapter 21.
Chapters 22 and 23 cover the biosphere. Chapter 22 is an overview of biochemistry with empha-
sis on environmental aspects. Chapter 23 introduces and outlines the topic of toxicological  chemistry. 
Chapter 24 discusses the toxicological chemistry of various classes of chemical substances.
Chapters 25 through 28 deal with environmental chemical analysis, including water, wastes, air, 
and xenobiotics in biological materials.
As noted above, two chapters on basic chemistry and organic chemistry that were present in the 
seventh and earlier editions have been removed from this edition for the sake of brevity. Readers 
who need this material can obtain fi  les containing these chapters from the publisher or the author.

1.1 FROM THE SUN TO FOSSIL FUELS AND BACK AGAIN
An old Chinese proverb states that, “If we do not change direction, we are likely to end up where we 
are headed.” The New Millennium has brought with it evidence that we have been on a course that, 
if not altered, will have profound, unpleasant effects on humankind and on the Earth upon which this 
species and all other living things depend for their existence. The World Trade Center attacks of 
September 11, 2001, as well as later attacks on the London subway system, trains in Madrid, hotels in 
Mumbai, and other places around the world showed the vulnerability of our civilization to malevolent 
actions of those who feel compelled to commit evil acts and raised concerns about the possibilities for 
even more damaging attacks with chemical, biological, or radioactive agents. The fi  rst part of 2008 
saw runaway prices for key commodities including petroleum, metals such as copper, and grain. Crude 
oil prices reached almost $150 per barrel in July 2008 and predictions were made that gasoline prices 
in the United States would exceed $5.00 per gallon for the foreseeable future. These trends were 
reversed in the latter part of 2008 with the occurrence of the greatest economic collapse the world had 
seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Housing prices, which had reached levels unsupportable 
by people with ordinary incomes, collapsed, and the prices of some commodities plummeted. In early 
2009, world leaders were struggling to fi  nd solutions to severe economic problems.
As humans and their governments struggle with economic challenges, evidence has continued to 
gather that their activities are degrading the Earth’s life support system upon which they depend for 
their existence. The emission to the atmosphere of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is 
almost certainly causing global warming. During the early 2000s, the Arctic ice cap diminished to a 
level never before observed in recorded history. Discharge of pollutants has degraded the atmosphere, 
hydrosphere, and geosphere in industrialized areas. Natural resources including minerals,  fossil fuels, 
freshwater, and biomass have become stressed and depleted. The productivity of agricultural land has 
been diminished by water and soil erosion, deforestation, desertifi  cation, contamination, and conver-
sion to nonagricultural uses. Wildlife habitats including woodlands, grasslands, estuaries, and  wetlands 
have been destroyed or damaged. About 3 billion people (half of the world’s population) live in dire 
poverty on less than the equivalent of U.S. $2 per day. The majority of these people lack access to sani-
tary sewers and the conditions under which they live give rise to debilitating viral, bacterial, and pro-
tozoal diseases including malaria and diarrhea. At the other end of the standard of living scale, a 
relatively small fraction of the world’ s population consumes an inordinate amount of resources with 
lifestyles that involve living too far from where they work, in energy-wasting houses that are far larger 
than they need, commuting long distances in large “sport utility vehicles” that consume far too much 
fuel, and overeating to the point of unhealthy obesity with accompanying problems of heart disease, 
diabetes, and other obesity-related maladies.
In a sense, the history of humankind and its relationship to Planet Earth is a story of “from the 
sun to fossil fuels and back again.” During virtually all their existence on Earth, humans have been 
dependent upon the bounty provided by the sun. Solar radiation provided the warmth required for 
humans to exist and was augmented by fi  re from burning of biomass generated by photosynthesis 2 Environmental Chemistry
and by garments made of skins of animals that had fed upon photosynthetically produced biomass. 
Food consumed by humans came from plants that converted solar energy into biomass chemical 
energy and from meat produced by plant-eating animals. As human societies developed, indirect 
means of utilizing solar energy were harnessed as well. Wind generated by solar heating of the 
atmosphere was utilized to drive windmills and to propel sailboats used for transportation. Humans 
learned to impound water and to convert the energy of fl  owing water to mechanical energy with 
waterwheels. The circulation of this water was part of the solar-powered hydrological cycle. Essentially 
everything that humans used and depended upon for their existence came ultimately from the sun.
1.1.1 T HE BRIEF BUT SPECTACULAR  ERA OF FOSSIL FUELS
As civilizations developed, humans discovered the uses of fossil fuels for energy. Although coal in 
those few locations where it was readily accessible from the surface had been used as a source of 
heat for centuries, the development of this energy source really took off around 1800, especially 
with the development of the steam engine as a practical power source. This began a massive shift 
from solar and biomass energy sources to fossil fuels, progressing from coal to petroleum and even-
tually natural gas. The result was an enormous revolution in human society with the development of 
huge heavy industries; transportation systems including rail, motor vehicles, and aircraft; and means 
of greatly increased food production. In Germany in the early 1900s, Carl Bosch and Fritz Haber 
developed the process for converting atmospheric elemental nitrogen to ammonia (NH3), a high-
pressure, energy-intensive process that required large amounts of fossil fuels. This discovery ena-
bled the production of huge quantities of relatively inexpensive nitrogen fertilizer and the resulting 
increase in agricultural production may well have saved Europe, with a rapidly developing popula-
tion at the time, from widespread starvation. So it was that the era of fossil fuel, which has been 
described as “fossiled sunshine,”1 dating from about 1800 enabled humankind to enjoy unpreceden-
ted material prosperity and to increase in numbers from around 1 billion to over 6 billion.
Now, however, it is apparent that the fossil fuel era, if not ending, will no longer be sustainable 
as the bedrock of industrial society. Approximately half of the world’s total petroleum resource has 
already been consumed and, despite periods of reduced demand such as occurred during the global 
economic downturn in 2009, petroleum will continue to become more scarce and expensive and can 
last for only a few more decades as the dominant fuel and organic chemicals source for humankind. 
Coal is much more abundant, but its utilization has troubling environmental implications, especially 
as the major source of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Natural gas, an ideal, clean-burning fossil 
fuel that produces the least amount of carbon dioxide per unit energy generated, is relatively abun-
dant and means have now been developed to extract it from previously inaccessible tight shale 
 formations; it can serve as a “bridging fuel” for several decades until other sources can be devel-
oped. Nuclear energy, properly used with nuclear fuel reprocessing, can take on a greater share of 
energy production, especially for base load electricity generation.
1.1.2  BACK TO THE SUN
Given the fact that humans cannot rely upon fossil hydrocarbons for future fuel and raw materials, it 
is back to the sun for meeting basic human needs. The most direct use of the sun is for solar  heating 
and for photovoltaic power generation. But there are probably even greater indirect uses of the sun for 
the production of energy and material. Arguably the fastest growing energy source in the world is 
electricity generated by wind. Wind is solar powered; basically, the sun heats masses of air, the air 
expands, and the wind blows. Biomass generated by solar-powered photosynthesis can be used as a 
raw material to replace petroleum in petrochemicals manufacture. Furthermore, biomass can be con-
verted to any of the hydrocarbon fuels including methane, diesel fuel, and gasoline as discussed in 
Chapter 19. The use of biomass for making liquid fuels has not gotten off to a particularly auspicious 
start in the United States and some other countries. This is because the two major synthetic fuels made The Environment and Sustainability Science 3
from biomass, ethanol from fermentation of sugar and biodiesel fuel made from plant lipid oils, largely 
use the most valuable parts of food plants—corn grain to get sugar for fermentation to ethanol and 
soybeans to get oil for the synthesis of biodiesel fuel. The yields from these pathways are relatively low 
and almost as much energy is required to grow and process grain to make fuel as is obtained from the 
fuel itself. The demand for corn and soybeans to make synthetic fuels has caused disruptions in the 
agricultural grain markets and resulted in infl  ated prices that have created hardships for people depen-
dent upon these crops for food. Sugarcane grown in more tropical regions, especially Brazil, produces 
very high yields of fermentable carbohydrate and is a practical energy source. Oil palm trees  produce 
fruits and seeds with high contents of oils used to make biodiesel fuel, but the intensive cultivation of 
oil palm trees in countries such as Malaysia has resulted in environmentally harmful destruction of 
rain forests. The diversion of palm oil to make fuel has resulted in less of it being available for food.
Fortunately, means exist to produce the biomass needed for fuel and raw material without 
 seriously disrupting the world’s food supply. The main pathway for doing so is through the thermo-
chemical conversion of biomass to synthesis gas, a mixture of CO and H2, followed by chemical 
synthesis of methane and other hydrocarbons by long-established technology discussed in Chapter 
19. The raw material for doing so may come from a number of renewable sources including crop 
by-products, dedicated crops, and algae. Crop by-products generated in huge quantities in agricul-
tural areas include corn stover (stalks, leaves, husks, and cobs of the plant), wheat straw, and rice 
straw . Although a certain amount of these materials needs to be returned to soil to maintain soil 
quality, a signifi  cant fraction can be removed for fuel and chemical synthesis (until the practice was 
prohibited because of air pollution, rice straw was commonly burned in the fi  elds to prevent excess 
accumulation of residues on soil). Dedicated crops such as hybrid poplar trees and sawgrass can be 
grown in large quantities for biomass. Microscopic aquatic algae can be vastly more productive of 
biomass than plants grown on soil and can thrive in brackish (somewhat saline) water in contain-
ments in desert areas. In all these cases mineral nutrients from the residues of thermochemical 
processing, especially potassium, can be returned to the soil. Clearly, photosynthetically produced 
biomass will have a large role to play in “re-entering the solar age.”
1.2 THE SCIENCE OF SUSTAINABILITY
Environmentalists, including the practitioners of environmental chemistry, are often accused of 
being gloomy and pessimistic. A close look at the state of the world can certainly give credence to 
such a view. However, the will and ingenuity of humans that have been directed toward exploiting 
world resources, giving rise to conditions leading to deterioration of Planet Earth, can be—indeed, 
are being—harnessed to preserve the planet, its resources, and its characteristics that are conducive 
to healthy and productive human life. The key is sustainability  or sustainable development  defi ned 
by the Bruntland Commission in 1987 as industrial progress that meets the needs of the present 
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.2 A key aspect of 
sustainability is the maintenance of the Earth’s carrying capacity, that is, its ability to maintain an 
acceptable level of human activity and consumption over a sustained period of time.3
Interviewed in February 2009, Dr. Steven Chu, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who had just 
been appointed Secretary of Energy in U.S. President Barack Obama’s new administration, listed 
three main areas that require Nobel-level breakthroughs in the achievement of sustainability: solar 
power, electric batteries, and the development of new crops that can be turned into fuel. He con-
tended that the effi  ciency of solar energy capture and conversion to electricity needed to improve 
several-fold. Improved electric batteries are needed to store electrical energy generated by renew-
able means and to enable practical driving ranges in electric vehicles. Improved crops are needed 
that convert solar energy to chemical energy in biomass at higher effi  ciencies than current crops. In 
this case the potential for improvement is enormous because most plants convert <1% of the solar 
energy falling on them to chemical energy through photosynthesis. Through genetic engineering, it 
is likely that this effi  ciency could be improved several-fold leading to vastly increased generation of 4 Environmental Chemistry
biomass. Clearly, the achievement of sustainability employing high-level scientifi  c developments 
will be an exciting development in decades to come.
1.2.1  ENVIRONMENTAL  SCIENCE
This book is about environmental chemistry . T o understand that topic, it is important to have some 
appreciation of environmental science and sustainability science as a whole. Environmental science  in 
its broadest sense is the science of the complex interactions that occur among the terrestrial, atmo-
spheric, aquatic, living, and anthropological systems that compose Earth and the surroundings that 
may affect living things. It includes all the disciplines, such as chemistry, biology, ecology, sociology, 
and government, that affect or describe these interactions.4 For the purposes of this book, environmen-
tal science will be defi  ned as the study of the earth, air, water, and living environments, and the effects 
of technology thereon. To a signifi  cant degree, environmental science has evolved from investigations 
of the ways by which, and places in which, living organisms carry out their life cycles. This discipline 
used to be known as natural history, which later evolved into ecology, the study of environmental fac-
tors that affect organisms and how organisms interact with these factors and with each other.
1.2.2  GREEN SCIENCE  AND TECHNOLOGY
In recent years the environmental movement has seen a shift away from emphasis primarily upon pol-
lution, its effects, and how to overcome these ill effects toward a broader view of sustainability. The 
more modern orientation is often labeled as “green.” As applied to chemistry, the practice of inherently 
safer and more environmentally friendly chemical science is called green chemistry ,5 a topic that is 
discussed in more detail later in this book. A spin-off of green chemistry to engine ering—especially 
chemical engineering—is known as green engineering .6 In the most general sense, the practice of 
sustainable science and technology can be called green science and tech nology . As humankind 
attempts to provide for numbers of people that are already very large for a planet of limited resources, 
the practice of green science and technology has become a matter of crucial importance.
1.3 CHEMISTRY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
As the science of all matter, chemistry obviously has a large role in understanding the environment 
and preserving its quality. In the past, grievous damage was done to the environment by misguided 
and ignorant practices of chemical science and engineering. Wastes from chemical processes were 
discarded by the cheapest, most convenient routes, which usually meant up the stack, down the 
drain, or onto the ground (Figure 1.1). Biologists observed the effects of these practices in the form 
of fi sh kills, declining bird populations, and deformed animals. Physicians noticed maladies caused 
by air and water pollution, such as respiratory problems from breathing polluted air. And ordinary 
citizens without any special scientifi  c knowledge could observe obscured visibility in polluted 
atmospheres and waterways choked with excessive plant growth from nutrients discharged into the 
water; eyes and nose alone were often suffi  cient to detect signifi  cant pollution problems.
But, as the science of matter, chemistry has an essential role to play in environmental protection 
and improvement. Increasingly, chemists have become familiar with chemical processes that occur 
in the environment and have developed means of directing chemical science toward environmental 
improvement. Since about 1970, the science of chemistry in the environment— environmental 
chemistry , the topic of this book—has emerged as a strong and dynamic science that has made 
enormous contributions to understanding the environment and the chemical and biochemical pro-
cesses that occur in it. Toxicological chemistry has developed as a discipline that relates the chemi-
cal nature of substances to their toxic effects.7
But to understand environmental problems is not enough. Measures need to be taken to not 
only alleviate such problems, but to prevent their developing in the fi  rst place. Toward those ends, other The Environment and Sustainability Science 5
disciplines are developing that point the way to more environmentally friendly ways of doing things. 
Sustainable development, the practice of industrial ecology, and the practice of green chemistry are all 
directed toward enabling human societies and industrial systems to exist in better harmony with the 
Earth’s support systems upon which all living beings ultimately depend for their existence. These 
areas, all dependent upon environmental chemistry, are developed in detail later in this book.
1.4 WATER, AIR, EARTH, LIFE, AND TECHNOLOGY
Water, air, earth, life, and technology are strongly interconnected as shown in Figure 1.2, which, in a 
sense, summarizes and outlines the theme of the rest of this book. Traditionally, environmental science 
has been divided into the study of the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, the geosphere, and the biosphere. 
However, for better or for worse, the environment in which all humans must live has been affected 
irreversibly by technology. Therefore, technology is considered strongly in this book within a separate 
environmental sphere called the anthrosphere in terms of how it affects the environment and in the ways 
by which, applied intelligently by those knowledgeable of environmental science, it can serve, rather 
than damage, this Earth upon which all living beings depend for their welfare and existence.
The strong interactions among living organisms and the various spheres of the abiotic (nonliving) 
environment are best described by cycles of matter that involve biological, chemical, and geological 
processes and phenomena. Such cycles are called biogeochemical cycles, and are discussed in more 
detail in Chapter 2 and elsewhere in this book.
In light of the above defi  nitions, it is now possible to consider environmental chemistry from the 
viewpoint of the interactions among water, air, earth, life, and the anthrosphere as outlined in 
Figure 1.2. These fi  ve environmental “spheres” and the interrelationships among them are summa-
rized in this section. In addition, the chapters in which each of these topics is discussed in greater 
detail are designated here.
1.4.1 W ATER AND THE HYDROSPHERE
The hydrosphere  contains the Earth’s water, a vitally important substance in all parts of the environ-
ment. Water, the environmental chemistry of which is discussed in detail in Chapters 3 through 8, is 
an essential part of all living systems and is the medium from which life evolved and in which life 
exists. Water covers about 70% of the Earth’s surface. Over 97% of the Earth’s water is in oceans, and 
Into the
riverOut the doorUp the stack
FIGURE 1.1  In the “bad old way” of doing things that prevailed until the mid-1900s, and even today in some 
places, wastes and by-products of chemical operations were commonly discarded to waterways, sent up stacks, 
or dumped in the geosphere, resulting in enormous environmental problems.6 Environmental Chemistry
most of the remaining freshwater is in the form of ice. Therefore, only a relatively small percentage of 
the total water on Earth is actually involved with terrestrial, atmospheric, and biological processes.
Water plays a key role in many segments of the anthrosphere, such as in boilers or municipal 
water distribution systems. Energy and matter are carried through various spheres of the environ-
ment by water. Water leaches soluble constituents from mineral matter and carries them to the ocean 
or leaves them as mineral deposits some distance from their sources. Water carries plant nutrients 
from soil into the bodies of plants by way of plant roots. Solar energy absorbed in the evaporation 
of ocean water is carried as latent heat and released inland. This process provides a large fraction 
of the energy that is transported from equatorial regions toward the Earth’s poles and that powers 
massive storms in the atmosphere.
1.4.2 A IR AND THE ATMOSPHERE
The atmosphere  is a thin protective blanket that nurtures life on Earth and protects it from the hos-
tile environment of outer space by absorbing energy and damaging ultraviolet radiation from the sun 
and by moderating the Earth’s temperature to within a range conducive to life. It is the source of 
carbon dioxide for plant photosynthesis and of oxygen for respiration. It provides the elemental 
nitrogen that nitrogen-fi  xing bacteria and ammonia-manufacturing industrial plants use to produce Atmosphere Hydrosphere

chemically bound nitrogen, an essential component of life molecules. As a basic part of the hydro-
logic cycle (Chapter 3, Figure 3.1), the atmosphere transports water from the oceans to land.
Atmospheric science deals with the movement of air masses in the atmosphere, atmospheric heat 
balance, and atmospheric chemical composition and reactions. Atmospheric chemistry is covered in 
Chapters 9 through 14 of this book.
1.4.3 E ARTH, THE GEOSPHERE
The geosphere , discussed in general in Chapter 15, consists of the solid earth, including soil, which 
supports most plant life (Chapter 16). The geosphere is composed of a solid, iron-rich inner core, a 
molten outer core, mantle, and the crust. The crust, only 5–40 km thick, is a thin outer skin com-
posed largely of lighter silicate-based minerals and is the most important part of the  geosphere 
insofar as interactions with the other spheres of the environment are concerned. It is that part of the 
Earth upon which humans live and from which they extract most of their food,  minerals, and fuels.
Geology is the science of the geosphere and is very important in considerations of the environ-
ment. It pertains mostly to the solid mineral portions of the Earth’s crust. But it must also consider 
water, which is involved in weathering rocks and in producing mineral formations; the atmosphere 
and climate, which have profound effects on the geosphere and interchange matter and energy with 
it; and living systems, which largely exist on the geosphere and in turn have signifi  cant effects on it. 
Modern technology, for example, the ability to move massive quantities of dirt and rock around, has 
a profound infl  uence on the geosphere.
1.4.4 L IFE, THE BIOSPHERE
All living entities on the Earth compose the biosphere . Living organisms and the aspects of the 
environment pertaining directly to them are called biotic, and other portions of the environment are 
abiotic. Biology is the science of life. It is based on biologically synthesized chemical species, many 
of which exist as large molecules called macromolecules. As living beings, the ultimate concern of 
humans with their environment is the interaction of the environment with life. Therefore, biological 
science is a key component of environmental science and environmental chemistry. 
The role of life in environmental science is discussed in the following section and in numerous 
other parts of this book. The crucial effects of microorganisms on aquatic chemistry are covered in 
Chapter 6. Chapter 22 addresses biochemistry as it applies to the environment. The effects on living 
beings of toxic substances, many of which are environmental pollutants, are addressed in Chapters 
23 and 24. Other chapters discuss aspects of the interaction of living systems with various parts of 
the environment.
1.4.5 T ECHNOLOGY  AND THE ENVIRONMENT
Technology  refers to the ways in which humans do and make things with materials and energy, that 
is, how they construct and operate the anthrosphere. Technology is the product of engineering based 
on science, which explains interrelated natural phenomena of energy, matter, time, and space. 
Engineering applies science to provide the plans and means to achieve specifi  c practical objectives. 
Technology uses these plans to carry out desired objectives.
It is essential to consider technology, engineering, and industrial activities in studying environ-
mental science because of the enormous infl  uence that they have on the environment. Humans will 
use technology to provide the food, shelter, goods, and transportation that they need for their well-
being and survival. The challenge is to integrate technology with considerations of the environment 
and ecology such that the two are mutually advantageous rather than in opposition to each other.
Technology, properly applied, is an enormously positive infl  uence for environmental protection. 
The most obvious such application is in air and water pollution control. As necessary as  “end-of-pipe” 8 Environmental Chemistry
measures are for the control of air and water pollution, it is much better to use technology in manu-
facturing processes to prevent the formation of pollutants. Technology is being used increasingly to 
develop highly effi  cient processes of energy conversion, renewable energy resource utilization, and 
conversion of raw materials to fi  nished goods with minimum generation of hazardous waste by-
products. In the transportation area, properly applied technology in areas such as  high-speed train 
transport can enormously increase the speed, energy effi  ciency, and safety of means by which people 
and goods are moved.
Until very recently, technological advances were made largely without heed to environmental 
impacts. Now, however, the greatest technological challenge is to reconcile technology with envi-
ronmental consequences. The survival of humankind and of the planet that supports it now requires 
that the established two-way interaction between science and technology become a three-way rela-
tionship including environmental protection and emphasizing sustainability.
1.5 ECOLOGY, ECOTOXICOLOGY, AND THE BIOSPHERE
1.5.1  THE BIOSPHERE
Virtually the entire biosphere composed of living organisms is contained by the geosphere and 
hydrosphere in the very thin layer where these environmental spheres interface with the atmosphere. 
There are some specialized life forms at extreme depths in the ocean, but these are still relatively 
close to the atmospheric interface.
The biosphere strongly infl  uences, and in turn is strongly infl  uenced by, the other parts of the 
environment. It is believed that organisms were responsible for converting the Earth’s original 
reducing atmosphere to an oxygen-rich one. Photosynthetic organisms remove CO2 from the atmo-
sphere, thus preventing runaway greenhouse warming of the Earth’s surface. Organisms largely 
determine aquatic chemistry in bodies of water, and are strongly involved in weathering processes 
that break down rocks in the geosphere and convert rock matter to soil. 
The biosphere is based upon plant photosynthesis , which fi  xes solar energy ( hn) and carbon from 
atmospheric CO2 in the form of high-energy biomass, represented as {CH2O}:
 CO2 + H2O + hn Æ {CH2O} + O2 (g) (1.1)
In so doing, plants and algae function as autotrophic organisms, those that utilize solar or chemical 
energy to fi  x elements from simple, nonliving inorganic material into complex life molecules that 
compose living organisms. Carbon that was originally fi  xed photosynthetically forms the basis of 
all fossil fuels in the geosphere. The opposite process of photosynthesis, namely biodegradation, 
breaks down biomass, preventing its accumulation in the environment, and releasing carbon dioxide 
to the atmosphere:
 {CH2O} + O2 (g) Æ CO2 + H2O (1.2)
There is a strong interconnection between the biosphere and the anthrosphere. Humans depend 
upon the biosphere for food, fuel, and raw materials. Sustainability in the face of diminishing sup-
plies of petroleum will increasingly rely on the biosphere for the production of raw materials and 
fuel in the future. Human infl  uence on the biosphere continues to change it drastically. Fertilizers, 
pesticides, and cultivation practices have vastly increased yields of biomass, grains, and food. 
Destruction of habitat is resulting in the extinction of many species, in some cases even before they 
are discovered. Bioengineering of organisms with recombinant DNA technology and older tech-
niques of selection and hybridization are causing great changes in the characteristics of organisms 
and promise to result in even more striking alterations in the future. It is the responsibility of human-
kind to make such changes intelligently and to protect and nurture the biosphere. The Environment and Sustainability Science 9
1.5.2 E COLOGY
Ecology  is the science that deals with the relationships between living organisms with their physical 
environment and with each other. An ecosystem  consists of an assembly of mutually interacting 
organisms (a community) and their environment in which materials are interchanged in a largely 
cyclical manner. An ecosystem has physical, chemical, and biological components along with  
energy sources and pathways of energy and materials interchange. The environment in which a 
particular organism lives is called its habitat . The role of an organism in a habitat is its niche . A 
major community of organisms based on predominant producers of biomass and adaptations of 
various organisms in the community to their environment is called a biome .
To study ecology it is often convenient to divide the environment into general categories. The 
terrestrial environment is based on land and consists of biomes, such as grasslands, savannas, 
d eserts, or one of several kinds of forests. The freshwater environment can be further subdivided 
into standing-water habitats (lakes and reservoirs) and running-water habitats (streams and  rivers). 
The oceanic marine environment is characterized by saltwater and may be divided broadly into the 
shallow waters of the continental shelf composing the neritic zone and the deeper waters of the 
ocean that constitute the oceanic region. An environment in which two or more kinds of organisms 
exist to their mutual benefi  t is termed a symbiotic environment.
A  p arti c ul ar l y  im po rtan t  f ac t o r  in  des cri b in g  eco s y s te ms  i s  tha t  o f  populations  consisting of 
numbers of a specifi  c species occupying a specifi  c habitat. Populations may be stable, or they may 
grow exponentially as a population explosion. A population explosion that is unchecked results in 
resource depletion, waste accumulation, and predation, culminating in an abrupt decline called a 
population crash. Behavior in areas such as hierarchies, territoriality, social stress, and feeding pat-
terns plays a strong role in determining the fates of populations. All of these aspects, including the 
possibility of a population crash, apply to human populations as well.
1.5.3 E COTOXICOLOGY
As discussed in detail in Chapters 23 and 24, toxicology  refers to the detrimental effects of sub-
stances on organisms. Substances with such effects are called toxic substances, toxicants, or p oisons. 
Whether or not a substance is toxic depends upon the amount of the substance an organism is 
exposed to and the manner of exposure. Some substances that are harmless or even benefi  cial at low 
levels are toxic at higher levels of exposure.
Toxic substances have a strong infl  uence on ecosystems and the organisms in ecosystems, so the 
interactions between ecology and toxicology are very important. These interactions may be com-
plex and involve a number of organisms. They may involve food chains and complex food webs. For 
example, persistent organohalide compounds may become more highly concentrated through food 
chains and exert their most adverse effects on organisms such as birds of prey at the top of the food 
chain. The combination of ecology and toxicology—the study of the effects of toxic substances 
u p o n  e c o s y s t e m s — h a s  c o m e  t o  b e  kn o w n  a s  ecotoxicology , which has been developed into an 
important discipline in environmental science.
Ecotoxicological effects may be considered through several different organizational levels. The 
fi rst is introduction of a toxicant or pollutant into the system. This may result in biochemical changes 
at the molecular level. As a result, physiological changes may occur in tissues and organs. These 
may result in detrimental alterations of organisms. As a result, the organisms affected may undergo 
population changes, such as those that occurred in the 1950s and 1960s with decreased populations 
of hawks exposed to DDT. Such changes can alter communities; for example, decreased numbers of 
hawks may allow increased numbers of rodents accompanied by greater destruction of grain crops. 
Finally, whole ecosystems may be altered signifi  cantly.
Whereas toxicology usually deals with the effects of toxic substances on individuals, ecotoxico-
logy emphasizes populations. Large numbers of individuals may be poisoned by toxic substances, 10 Environmental Chemistry
whereas the population may survive. Dealing with populations as it does, ecotoxicology is signifi  -
cantly more complex than toxicology. In reducing risk, emphasis is usually placed upon the protec-
tion of species composition since that automatically protects ecosystem processes.
1.6 ENERGY AND CYCLES OF ENERGY
Biogeochemical cycles and virtually all other processes on the Earth are driven by energy from the 
sun. The sun acts as a so-called blackbody radiator with an effective surface temperature of 5780 K 
(absolute temperature in which each unit is the same as a Celsius degree, but with zero taken at abso-
lute zero). It transmits energy to the Earth as electromagnetic radiation (see below) with a maximum 
energy fl  ux at about 500 nm, which is in the visible region of the spectrum. A 1 m2 area perpendicular 
to the line of solar fl  ux at the top of the atmosphere receives energy at a rate of 1340 W, suffi  cient, for 
example, to power an electric iron. This is called the solar fl  ux (see Chapter 9, Figure 9.3).
1.6.1 L IGHT AND ELECTROMAGNETIC  RADIATION
Electromagnetic radiation ,  p art i c u l ar l y  l i g h t ,  i s  o f  u t m o s t  i m p o rt a n c e  i n  c o n s i d e ri n g  e n e r g y  i n  
environmental systems. Therefore, the following important points related to electromagnetic radia-
tion should be noted:
Energy can be carried through space at the speed of light (• c), 3.00 ¥ 108 meters per second 
(m/s) in a vacuum, by electromagnetic radiation, which includes visible light, ultraviolet 
radiation, infrared radiation, microwaves, radio waves, g-rays, and x-rays.
Electromagnetic radiation has the character of a wave. The waves move at the speed of • 
light, c, and have the characteristics of wavelength ( l), amplitude, and frequency ( n, Greek 
“nu”) as illustrated below: 
Amplitude
WavelengthShorter wavelength,
higher frequency
The wavelength is the distance required for one complete cycle, and the frequency is the • 
number of cycles per unit time. They are related by the following equation:
 nl = c
 where n is expressed in units of cycles per second [s−1, a unit called the hertz (Hz)] and l is 
in meters (m).
In addition to behaving as a wave, electromagnetic radiation has the characteristics of • 
particles.
The dual wave/particle nature of electromagnetic radiation is the basis of the quantum theory • 
of electromagnetic radiation, which states that radiant energy may be absorbed or emitted 
only in discrete packets called quanta or photons. The energy, E, of each photon is given by
 E = hn 
 where h is Planck’s constant, 6.63 ¥ 10−34 J s.
From the preceding, it is seen that the energy of a photon is higher when the frequency of • 
the associated wave is higher (and the wavelength shorter).The Environment and Sustainability Science 11
1.6.2  ENERGY  FLOW AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS  IN LIVING SYSTEMS
Whereas materials are recycled through ecosystems, the fl  ow of useful energy is essentially a one-
way process. Incoming solar energy can be regarded as high-grade energy because it can cause 
useful reactions to occur, such as production of electricity in photovoltaic cells or photosynthesis in 
plants. As shown in Figure 1.3, solar energy captured by green plants energizes chlorophyll, which 
in turn powers metabolic processes that produce carbohydrates from water and carbon dioxide. 
These carbohydrates are repositories of stored chemical energy that can be converted to heat and 
work by metabolic reactions with oxygen in organisms. Ultimately, most of the energy is converted 
to low-grade heat, which is eventually reradiated away from the Earth by infrared radiation.
1.6.3  ENERGY  UTILIZATION
During the last two centuries, the growing, enormous human impact on energy utilization has resulted 
in many of the environmental problems now facing humankind. This time period has seen a transition 
from the almost exclusive use of energy captured by photosynthesis and utilized as biomass (food to 
provide muscle power, wood for heat) to the use of fossil fuel petroleum, natural gas, and coal for about 
90%, and nuclear energy for about 5%, of all energy employed commercially. By 2008, it had become 
painfully obvious that resources of the most desirable fossil fuels (petroleum and natural gas) were 
becoming depleted and falling behind in meeting demand. Of particular importance is the fact that all 
fossil fuels produce carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that is almost certainly causing global warming. 
Therefore, as noted at the beginning of this chapter, it will be necessary to move toward the utilization 
of alternate renewable energy sources, including solar energy and biomass. The study of energy utili-
zation is crucial in sustainability science, and it is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 19.

1.7 HUMAN IMPACT AND POLLUTION
The demands of increasing population coupled with the desire of most people for a higher material 
standard of living are resulting in worldwide pollution  on a massive scale. All fi  ve of the major 
environmental spheres can suffer from pollution and all are linked with respect to pollution phe-
nomena. For example, some gases emitted to the atmosphere can be converted to strong acids by 
atmospheric chemical processes, fall to the Earth as acid rain, and pollute water with acidity. 
Improperly discarded hazardous wastes can leach into groundwater that is eventually released as 
polluted water into streams.
1.7.1 S OME DEFINITIONS  PERTAINING  TO POLLUTION
In some cases, pollution is a clear-cut phenomenon, while in other cases it lies largely in the eyes of 
the beholder. Frequently, time and place determine what may be called a pollutant. The phosphate 
that the sewage treatment plant operator has to remove from wastewater is chemically the same as 
the phosphate that the farmer a few miles away has to buy at high prices for fertilizer. Most pollut-
ants are, in fact, resources gone to waste; as resources become scarcer and more expensive, eco-
nomic pressures can provide impetus for solutions to many pollution problems. A key aspect of 
sustainability is the diversion of matter in pollutants to useful applications.
A reasonable defi  nition of a pollutant  is a substance present in greater than natural concentration 
as a result of human activity that has a net detrimental effect upon its environment or upon some-
thing of value in that environment. Contaminants , which are not classifi  ed as pollutants unless they 
have some detrimental effect, cause deviations from the normal composition of an environment.
Every pollutant originates from a source . The source is particularly important because it is gene-
rally the logical place to eliminate pollution. After a pollutant is released from a source, it may act 
upon a receptor. The receptor  is an ything that is aff ected b y the pollutant. Humans whose ey es 
smart from oxidants in the atmosphere are receptors. Trout fi  ngerlings that may die after exposure 
to acid from acid rain in water are also receptors. Eventually, if the pollutant is long-lived, it may be 
deposited in a sink, a long-time repository of the pollutant. Here it will remain for a long time, 
though not necessarily permanently. Thus, a limestone wall may be a sink for atmospheric sulfuric 
acid by conversion of CaCO3 in limestone into CaSO4.
1.7.2 P OLLUTION  OF VARIOUS  SPHERES  OF THE ENVIRONMENT
Pollution of surface water and groundwater is discussed in some detail in Chapter 7. Particulate air 
pollutants are covered in Chapter 10, gaseous inorganic air pollutants in Chapter 11, and organic air 
pollutants and associated photochemical smog in Chapters 12 and 13. Some air pollutants, particu-
larly those that may result in irreversible global warming or destruction of the protective strato-
spheric ozone layer, are of such a magnitude that they have the potential to threaten life on the 
Earth. These are discussed in Chapter 14. Hazardous wastes are discussed in Chapters 20 and 21. 
Toxic pollutants are addressed in Chapters 23 and 24.
1.8 CHEMICAL FATE AND TRANSPORT
The movement and fate of environmental pollutants is a key consideration in determining their 
impacts. This concern is addressed by the discipline of chemical fate and transport  or environmen-
tal fate and transport . Figure 1.4 illustrates the major pathways involved in chemical fate and trans-
port. Substances regarded as pollutants almost always originate from the anthrosphere ( although 
substances such as sulfur-containing volcanic gases can act as pollutants as well). They may move 
into the air, onto the ground, into water (surface water or groundwater), into sediments, and into 
biota (plants and animals). Where such substances go and what they do depend upon their properties The Environment and Sustainability Science 13
and the conditions of the environment into which they are introduced. As a general rule, the fate and 
transport of contaminants are controlled by their physical transport  (movement without reacting or 
interacting with other phases) and their reactivity , including chemical or biochemical reactions or 
physical interactions with other phases.
It is convenient to view environmental fate and transport in terms of three major environmental 
compartments: (1) the atmosphere, (2) surface waters, and (3) the terrestrial or subsurface including 
soil, mineral strata, and groundwater. These compartments are illustrated in Figure 1.5.Micro-

transport.14 Environmental Chemistry
1.8.1  PHYSICAL  TRANSPORT
Although there are numerous physical transport processes depending upon the medium in which the 
contaminants are found, they may be divided into two categories. The fi  rst of these is advection  due 
to movement of masses of fl  uids that simply carry pollutants with them. Vertical advection of air or 
water is called convection . The second type of movement of chemical species is diffusive transport  
or Fickian transport , most commonly regarded as molecular diffusion, the natural tendency of 
molecules to move from regions of higher to regions of lower concentration by the random move-
ment of molecules. Diffusive transport is also approximated by turbulent mixing. Turbulent mixing 
can be seen in the eddies of a fl  owing stream, and a similar phenomenon occurs in air. The mixing 
that occurs as water fl  ows around and among small particles as it fl  ows underground is also treated 
as a form of diffusive transport.
Air contaminants move with wind and air currents, by diffusion processes, and by settling and 
suspension of atmospheric aerosol particles. Water contaminants move by currents in water, by 
turbulent mixing processes, by diffusion, and by settling and suspension of particles. In solids, 
such as mineral formations, contaminants move by the action of groundwater or by diffusion in 
the vapor phase. The mobility of contaminants depends upon the fl  uidity of the medium in 
which they are contained. Contaminants in the atmosphere may move by as much as several 
kilometers per hour in wind, whereas their movement in soil and solids may be almost 
imperceptible.
1.8.2 R EACTIVITY
Reactivity  includes chemical reactions, biological uptake, and binding to and release from surfaces. 
Reactivity processes include the two broad categories of chemical reactions and interphase exchange. 
In water, interphase exchange could include the binding of soluble species to suspended particles in 
water and in air it could include evaporation and condensation of species. Biological processes fall 
into the broad category of interphase exchange, but any biochemical reactions that pollutants taken 
up by organisms undergo are obviously chemical changes.
1.8.3 M ASS BALANCE  EXPRESSION
Like all matter, pollutants are governed by mass conservation, which simply accounts for all the 
matter in a pollutant wherever it is moved and whatever reactions it might undergo. In considering 
mass conservation in the environment, it is useful to defi  ne a control volume  as a part of the envi-
ronment within which all sources and sinks of a pollutant can be accounted for and across the 
boundaries of which movement of pollutants may be known. In relationship to such a portion of the 
environment, a pollutant is described by the mass balance relationship  as sho wn in Fi gure 1 . 6. 
A special case of the mass balance relationship that often simplifi  es the study of environmental fate 
and transport is when there is no net change in the mass of pollutant within the control volume, a 
condition of steady state .
A typical control volume might be the water in a lake, not including the sediment layer. 
Uptake of a substance by the sediment would depend upon the relative affi  nity of the substance 
for water and sediment. For example, a relatively hydrophobic substance would have a strong 
tendency to leave the water phase and enter the organic phase in the sediment. A substance that 
is volatile would tend to evaporate at the surface. The substance might be changed by biodegra-
dation processes mediated by microorganisms suspended in the lake water. Water might fl  ow 
into the lake from a stream source and out of the lake through an outlet stream. From these con-
siderations it should be obvious that although the concept of the mass balance relationship is 
straightforward, its calculation for a substance in a particular control volume can become quite 
complicated.The Environment and Sustainability Science 15
1.8.4 D ISTRIBUTION  AMONG  PHASES
Distribution among phases  is very important in environmental fate and transport. This may involve 
movement between major environmental compartments shown in Figure 1.5. Or it may entail parti-
tioning between phases within an environmental compartment. For example, a gaseous air pollutant 
in the atmosphere might be taken up by plant leaves and move from the atmospheric to the terres-
trial compartment. Or it might absorb onto particulate matter in the atmosphere. A chemical species 
in the subsurface may be absorbed to soil particles, dissolve in soil water, or even partition into air 
spaces in the Earth.
The various factors involved in partitioning environmental species between phases are addressed 
in more detail in Chapters 5 (water), 9 (the atmosphere), and 15 (terrestrial); several examples are 
mentioned here. The tendency of a substance to partition between water and solids in contact with 
the water depends upon the substance’s water solubility or hydrophilic tendencies. A substance in 
water that has a high vapor pressure will tend to evaporate into the atmosphere. Species in the atmo-
sphere that are organophilic may be taken up by the wax-like surfaces of plant structures, such as 
pine needles.
There are two major ways in which a substance may be sequestered by another phase. It may bind 
with the surface, such as occurs when some organic contaminants in water are taken up by surface 
interactions with solids, a process called adsorption . Or it may actually be incorporated into the 
body of material to which it is bound, a process called absorption . A more general term that applies 
to both processes is sorption . A substance is said to be sorbed ; it is called the sorbate  and the 
m aterial to which it is bound is called the sorbent .
1.9  CHEMICAL FATE AND TRANSPORT IN THE ATMOSPHERE, 
HYDROSPHERE, AND GEOSPHERE
This section briefl  y addresses chemical fate and transport in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and 
 geosphere. It is important to have a rudimentary perspective of chemical fate and transport in these 
spheres to understand chemical fate and transport in later parts of the book. These aspects are 
discussed in more detail in later chapters dealing with specifi  c spheres of the environment. FIGURE 1.6  Illustration of the mass balance relationship for a pollutant with respect to a specifi  ed

1.9.1  POLLUTANTS  IN THE ATMOSPHERE
Substances that tend to be transported to the atmosphere are those that are relatively volatile. Such 
substances include those that are gases under normal ambient conditions, including compounds such 
as nitric oxide (NO) or carbon monoxide (CO). A number of organic compounds including those in 
gasoline or chlorofl  uorocarbons are called volatile organic compounds  (VOC). Organic compounds 
that are less volatile nevertheless get into air are classifi  ed as semivolatile organic compounds .
An important consideration regarding substances that get into the atmosphere is the degree to 
which they are hydrophobic . Hydrophobic substances, including a number of the VOC and semi-
volatile organic compounds, are those that are repelled by water. Their opposites, hydrophilic 
 compounds , readily dissolve in water and are removed by precipitation (rain). For example, 
both methanol and dichloromethane are VOC, but methanol is highly water soluble and is rapidly 
removed from the atmosphere with rainfall, whereas dichloromethane is hydrophobic and tends to 
stay in the air.
A number of important air pollutants are in the form of particulate matter, popularly called par-
ticulates . Particles may be emitted directly to the atmosphere from sources such as power plants 
emitting fl  y ash. Or they may be formed by the reactions of gases as occurs when particles charac-
teristic of photochemical smog are formed from hydrocarbon vapors, nitrogen oxides, and oxygen 
in the atmosphere. Heavy particles tend to settle rapidly and deposit on soil or on the surfaces of 
plant leaves. Lighter particles tend to stay in the atmosphere longer and travel farther from their 
sources. Particles of water-soluble materials or with hydrophilic surfaces are readily removed by 
rainfall and may get into water.
1.9.2  POLLUTANTS  IN THE HYDROSPHERE
Pollutants may be discharged directly to water or may get into water from the atmosphere or 
from soil runoff. Both surface water and water under the ground—groundwater—must be conside-
red. Groundwater may pick up pollutants as contaminated surface water that fl  ows from the surface 
into underground aquifers as part of the process of recharge. Another pollutant source of major 
concern is leachate from wastes that have been improperly disposed on the surface or in landfi  lls. 
Particularly, soluble (hydrophilic) chemicals have a strong tendency to stay dissolved in water and 
to move with the fl  ow of surface water or groundwater. More hydrophobic species in water will have 
a greater tendency to be held on mineral surfaces (in groundwater) or in sediments (in surface 
water).
The tendency of a solute in water to be retained by soil, sediment, or aquifer mineral is expressed 
by a parameter Kd, commonly called the soil–water partition coeffi  cient  and expressed as
 =s
d
wCKC (1.3)
where Cs is the equilibrium concentration of the contaminant in the solid and Cw is the equilibrium 
concentration of the contaminant in water. The organic fraction of the solid material in soil, sedi-
ments, and even minerals is generally the material with the predominant affi  nity for organic conta-
minants. Designating this fraction as foc and the partition coeffi  cient of the organic contaminant for 
the pure organic solid as Koc, the following holds:
 Kd = foc ¥ Koc (1.4)
This relationship shows that as the fraction of organic sorbent in the solid increases, the effective 
value of Kd increases as well.The Environment and Sustainability Science 17
1.9.3  POLLUTANTS  IN THE GEOSPHERE
The transport of contaminants in the geosphere is largely by movement of groundwater through rock 
formations composing aquifers. In cases where the aquifer mineral material is composed of fi  nely 
divided matter such as sand, the contaminants in the groundwater are continuously exposed to the 
mineral surface and may be absorbed by it. Very commonly, however, the aquifer consists of solid rock 
fragmented by fractures through which groundwater may move rapidly and over long distances. In 
such a case, contaminants do not have a good opportunity to be taken up by the mineral surface. This 
can result in the rapid appearance of contaminants from an infi  ltrating water source in well water sup-
plies of drinking water. Numerous cases have occurred in which surface pollution, such as by heavy 
metals or organic solvents, have rapidly infi  ltrated groundwater and moved to a well used as a water 
source. An interesting case consists of dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) that sink to the 
 bottom of the aquifer and accumulate as pools of material that might get into a water source.
1.10 ENVIRONMENTAL MISCHIEF AND TERRORISM
Unfortunately, chemistry has a great deal of potential for wreaking havoc in the hands of those who 
would do evil deeds. The potential of chemistry to cause harm in the wrong hands comes to mind 
in considering terrorism. The terrorists’ favorite weapons, explosives, act by means of very rapid 
chemical reactions that very rapidly release large amounts of energy and heat. Another potentially 
deadly terrorist tool consists of toxic substances made by chemists. Some of these, such as hydrogen 
cyanide, are used industrially. Others, such as deadly nerve gases, are made specifi  cally for military 
poisons. But chemistry also works to thwart terrorism, for example, by the use of very sensitive 
analytical techniques that can detect threats, such as explosives or toxic chemicals.
Environmental chemistry certainly has a strong connection to understanding and combating 
 terrorism. It is not much of an exaggeration to consider widespread environmental harm, such as 
that infl  icted by the improper use of chemicals and chemical processes, as a form of terrorism. It 
takes no great stretch of the imagination to believe that a crowded urban area affl  icted with smoke, 
 gasoline fumes, nitrogen oxides, and ozone is under a form of terrorist attack. Some of the great 
environmental catastrophes, such as the release of methyl isocyanate in Bhopal, India, in 1984 that 
killed 3500 people, or the catastrophic explosion and fi  re of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 
the former Soviet Union in 1986, have resembled terrorist attacks in their development and effects. 
So did a release of natural gas containing deadly hydrogen sulfi  de and accompanying fi  re from a 
natural gas well in China in December 2003, killing almost 200 people. Such attacks can take the 
form of environmental damage to water supplies or soil. The study of unfortunate environmental 
catastrophes of the past can provide guidance in dealing with terrorist attacks in the future.
1.10.1 P ROTECTION  THROUGH  GREEN CHEMISTRY  AND ENGINEERING
The single best way that chemical science can avoid terrorist threats is to follow the precepts of 
green chemistry, a topic that is developed further in Chapter 2 and later in this book. This is so 
because green chemistry is safe chemistry  and sustainable chemistry . Green chemistry avoids the 
hazards that might be turned to malevolent ends. Sustainable chemistry means that the chemical 
industry and other enterprises that depend upon it are resistant to disruptive incidents such as those 
that could cause problems when supplies of essential raw materials are curtailed.
Green chemistry avoids the use or generation of substances that pose hazards to humans and the 
environment. When such substances are not made or used, they are simply unavailable for theft or 
diversion by criminal elements. Green chemical products are as effective as possible for their desig-
nated purpose, but with minimum toxicity. Chemical products that do what they are supposed to do 
when used in minimum quantities reduce the hazards posed by potential improper use. Green  chemistry 
minimizes or avoids the use of auxiliary substances. These may include materials, such as fl  ammable 18 Environmental Chemistry
solvents, that may be hazardous, so reducing or minimizing their use can increase safety. Green chem-
istry avoids the use or generation of substances that are likely to react violently, burn, build up exces-
sive pressures, or otherwise cause unforeseen incidents in the manufacturing process; the safety 
aspects of avoiding such substances are obvious. Green chemistry attempts to minimize the severity 
of conditions, particularly those of temperature and pressure, under which chemical processing is 
c arried out. This can have the effect of greatly reducing damage that would occur through damage to 
chemical reactors and other processing equipment in the event of a malfunction.
The practice of green chemistry minimizes energy consumption. One way in which this is done 
is to use biological processes, which, because of the conditions under which organisms grow and 
their enzymes function, must occur at moderate temperatures and in the absence of toxic sub-
stances, thereby enhancing safety. Any measures that reduce the dependence on potentially hostile 
foreign sources of energy indirectly reduce vulnerability to terrorism. The same principle applies to 
reduced use of critical raw materials by the application of green chemistry.
The successful practice of green chemistry requires real-time, in-process monitoring techniques 
coupled with process control. Such a control is consistent with minimizing hazards including those 
caused by sabotage. It should be noted that passive systems of safety should be employed that will 
work by default if intricate control systems fail or are damaged (e.g., passive cooling of nuclear reac-
tors by water fl  owing under gravity in the event of cooling system malfunction).
It should be noted that the chemical industry and related enterprises are taking steps to imple-
ment the practice of green chemistry to reduce vulnerabilities to attack. For example, manufactur-
ing operations that once stored highly toxic methyl isocyanate, the agent of the catastrophic 1984 
Bhopal, India, disaster, now make this material on demand as needed at the plant. Some water treat-
ment plants that used to store reactive, toxic liquid chlorine disinfectant under pressure in 90-ton 
rail cars located on site have replaced it with much safer solid sodium hypochlorite.
1.11 ENVIRONMENTAL FORENSICS
Environmental forensics  is the science that deals with the legal and medical aspects of environmen-
tal pollution.8 It is an important area because of the health effects of pollutants and because often 
large sums of money are at stake in lawsuits aimed at determining parties responsible for environ-
mental contamination, such as hazardous waste sites. Furthermore, environmental forensics can be 
used for determining parties responsible for terrorist attacks that had used chemical agents. This 
discipline studies the sources, transport, and effects of pollutants with the goal of determining 
 parties responsible for pollution and harmful environmental events. Important aspects are the 
source, timing, or extent of an environmental incident. Typically, in cases where hazardous chemi-
cal wastes are improperly disposed, soil and groundwater are examined to determine the site history 
through studies of groundwater fl  ow, groundwater chemical and physical analyses, and modeling. 
The chemical analysis of groundwater can provide a fi  ngerprint of the source of pollution leading to 
knowledge of its location and extent, often pointing the way to parties responsible for it. In addition 
to chemical analysis, other disciplines that may be involved include chemical use history (which can 
help establish a time frame for when the contamination occurred), geology and forensic geochem-
istry, hydrogeology, and historical aerial photo interpretation. Computerized contaminant transport 
modeling of complex subsurface environments can also be very useful.
As discussed later in this book, the renovation of land areas damaged by chemical pollution—the 
restoration of so-called brownfi  elds—is an important aspect of sustainability. Before a brownfi  eld 
land area that has been damaged by dumping of wastes can be restored and used for commercial or 
residential applications, the nature and extent of contamination must be assessed and measures must 
be taken to remove or neutralize any hazardous material, in some cases with charges addressed to 
parties responsible for the wastes. Environmental forensics has a role to play in these activities. The 
fi ndings of environmental forensics can reduce the time and costs of legal proceedings leading to 
negotiated settlements between the parties involved.The Environment and Sustainability Science 19

QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS
The use of internet resources is assumed in answering any of the questions. These would include 
such things as constants and conversion factors as well as additional information needed to com-
plete an answer.
 1. Under what circumstances does a contaminant become a pollutant?
 2. Chemical plants and the chemical industry have been the subject of much concern regard-
ing the potential for terrorist attack. Look up this subject in the Internet and attempt to 20 Environmental Chemistry
discern which products and processes pose the greater risks. What is being done to reduce 
these risks? Can you fi  nd reports of any major incidents in which the products of chemical 
manufacturing have been used for attacks? 
 3. The argument has been made that nuclear power generation and spent nuclear fuel trans-
port and processing pose less danger of terrorist attacks than do corresponding operations 
in the chemical industry. Suggest the rationale for such an argument. If criminals were to 
obtain highly radioactive materials, explain why it might be very diffi  cult for them to do 
anything with them.
 4. Explain how toxicological chemistry differs from environmental biochemistry.
 5. Distinguish between the geosphere, lithosphere, and crust of the Earth. Which science 
deals with these parts of the environment?
 6. Defi  ne ecology and explain how it relates to at least one of the major biogeochemical 
cycles, such as the carbon cycle.
 7. Although energy is not destroyed, why is it true that the fl  ow of useful  energy through an 
environmental system is essentially a one-way process?
 8. Describe some ways in which patterns of energy use have “resulted in many of the envi-
ronmental problems now facing humankind.”
 9. Compare nuclear energy to fossil fuel energy sources and defend or refute the statement, 
“Nuclear energy, with modern, safe, and effi  cient reactors, is gaining increasing attention 
as a reliable, environmentally friendly energy source.”
 10. The sun powers a cycle of matter that is key to the indirect utilization of solar energy 
through the medium of water. What is this cycle? How does it enable solar energy to be 
converted to mechanical energy and ultimately to electrical energy?
 11. Using Internet resources, look up the percentages of carbon and hydrogen in natural gas 
(hint: What is the major hydrocarbon compound in natural gas?), gasoline, and typical 
bituminous coal and come up with a chemical formula in the form of CHh for each of these 
fuels, where h will not necessarily be a whole number. Write a chemical reaction for the 
combustion of each in the form of CHh + h/4O2 Æ h/2H2O. Noting that the combustion of 
both hydrocarbon-bound C and H produces heat, rank these three kinds of fuels in order 
from the one that produces the least greenhouse gas CO2 per molecule burned to the one 
that produces the most. 
 12. A former industrial site (“brownfi  eld”) has been chosen for an urban renewal project. It is 
known to be contaminated with potentially harmful materials released from previous man-
ufacturing operations. Suggest an environmental forensics program that could be used as 
part of the effort to renovate the site.
 13. In China in 2003, the release of gas from a gas well killed about 200 people. To help rem-
edy the problem, the gas was deliberately set on fi  re. What pollutant species (other than 
CO2) was produced by the fi  re? Despite generation of this pollutant, why was setting the 
gas on fi  re the best emergency measure to take until the well could be capped?

violet radiation from the sun of wavelength 300 nm to become an energetically “excited” 
species (see Chapter 9). Calculate the energy in joules absorbed.
 17. As a general rule, the fate and transport of contaminants are controlled by their physical 
transport and their reactivity. Can these two factors be considered to be entirely separate? 
Explain.The Environment and Sustainability Science 21
 18. Conventionally, environmental fate and transport are considered in terms of three major 
environmental compartments: (1) the atmosphere, (2) surface waters, and (3) the terrestrial 
or subsurface environment. Should the biosphere and anthrosphere be considered as sepa-
rate compartments? Give arguments for and against doing so.
 19. The fate and transport of contaminants is controlled in part by their reactivity. Suggest 
examples of chemical, biological, and physical reactivity processes.
 20. Explain the signifi  cance of mass conservation, control volume, and steady state in the mass 
balance relationship.
 21. How may volatility, hydrophobic tendency, and hydrophilic tendency be involved in envi-
ronmental fate and transport in the atmosphere?
 22. A pollutant, “ X,” was found to be in equilibrium between soil and water in contact with the 
soil. Its concentration in the soil was determined to be 0.44 mg/kg of dry soil and its con-
centration in water was measured as 0.037 mg/L. What is the value of Kd and what are its 
units?
 23. If the soil in the preceding question was 5.2% organic matter and the entire affi  nity of the 
soil for “ X” was due to organic matter, what is the value of the partition coeffi  cient of the 
organic contaminant for the pure organic solid, Koc?
 24. Even though the ability of contaminants to move through solid soil is usually very low, 
transport of a contaminant from one terrestrial location to another often occurs rather 
quickly. Explain.
 25. Using Internet resources, fi  nd at least one case in which criminal penalties have been 
assessed for environmental pollution and discuss how environmental forensics were used 
in the case.232Chemistry and the 
Anthrosphere: Environmental 
Chemistry and Green 
Chemistry
2.1 ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY
In Chapter 1, the environment was defi  ned as consisting of fi  ve spheres: the hydrosphere, the atmo-
sphere, the geosphere, the biosphere, and the anthrosphere; that is, water, air, the Earth, life, and 
those parts of the environment consisting of human constructs and activities. The chemistry of the 
environment, environmental chemistry , may be defi  ned as the study of the sources, reactions, trans-
port, effects, and fates of chemical species in the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, the geosphere, and 
the anthrosphere and the effects of human activities thereon . This defi  nition is illustrated for a  typical 
environmental pollutant in Figure 2.1. The pollutant sulfur dioxide is generated during the combus-
tion of sulfur in coal, transported to the atmosphere with fl  ue gas, and oxidized by chemical and 
photochemical processes to sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid, in turn, falls as acidic precipitation, where it 
may have detrimental effects such as toxic effects on trees and other plants. Eventually, sulfuric acid 
is carried by stream runoff to a lake or ocean where its ultimate fate is to be stored in solution in the 
water or precipitated as solid sulfates.
Environmental chemistry is complicated by the continuous and variable interchange of chemical 
species among various environmental spheres. This complexity is illustrated for sulfur species in 
Figure 2.1. The sulfur in coal is taken from the geosphere, converted to gaseous sulfur dioxide by 
an anthrospheric process (combustion), transported and undergoes chemical reactions in the atmo-
sphere, may affect plants in the biosphere, and ends up in a sink in the hydrosphere or back in the 
geosphere. Throughout this sequence, sulfur takes on several forms including organically bound 
sulfur or pyrite (FeS2) in coal, sulfur dioxide produced in the combustion of coal, sulfuric acid pro-
duced by the oxidation of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere, and sulfate salts produced from sulfuric 
acid when it reaches the geosphere. Throughout an environmental system there are variations in 
temperature, mixing, intensity of solar radiation, input of materials, and various other factors that 
strongly infl  uence chemical conditions and behavior. Because of its complexity, environmental 
chemistry must be approached with simplifi  ed models.
Green chemistry, the practice of chemical science and technology in a nonpolluting, safe, and 
sustainable manner, and industrial ecology, which treats industrial systems in a manner analogous to 
natural ecosystems, are discussed in detail later in this chapter and in Chapter 17. Environmental 
chemistry has a strong connection to both of these disciplines. A major goal of green chemistry is to 
avoid environmental pollution, an endeavor that requires knowledge of environmental chemistry. 
The design of an integrated system of industrial ecology must consider the principles and processes 
of environmental chemistry. Environmental chemistry must be considered in the extraction of 
 materials from the geosphere and other environmental spheres to provide the materials required by 24 Environmental Chemistry
industrial systems in a manner consistent with minimum environmental impact. The facilities and 
processes of an industrial ecology system can be sited and operated for minimal adverse environmen-
tal impact if environmental chemistry is considered in their planning and operation. Environmental 
chemistry clearly points the way to minimize the environmental impacts of the emissions and by-
products of industrial systems, and is very helpful in reaching the ultimate goal of a system of indus-
trial ecology, which is to reduce these emissions and by-products to zero.
Environmental chemistry can be divided into several categories. The fi  rst of these addressed in 
this book is aquatic chemistry , which deals with chemical phenomena in water. Various aspects of 
aquatic chemistry are discussed in Chapters 3 through 8. As the name implies, atmospheric chem-
istry deals with chemical phenomena in the atmosphere. Atmospheric chemistry is discussed in 
Chapters 9 through 14. General aspects of the environmental chemistry of the geosphere are dis-
cussed in Chapter 15, and soil chemistry is the topic of Chapter 16. The anthrosphere and environ-
mental chemistry are discussed in Chapters 17 through 21. The biosphere related to environmental 
chemistry is mentioned in various contexts throughout the book as it relates to environmental chem-
ical processes in water and soil. It is the main topic of discussion of Chapters 22 through 24. 
Toxicological chemistry defi  ned as the chemistry of toxic substances with emphasis on their inter-
actions with biologic tissue and living organisms  1 is addressed specifi  cally in Chapters 23 and 24. 
Analytical chemistry  is uniquely important in environmental chemistry. Environmental chemical 
analysis is discussed in Chapters 25 through 28.
2.2 MATTER AND CYCLES OF MATTER
Very much connected with environmental chemistry, cycles of matter , often based on elemental 
cycles, are of utmost importance in the environment. Global geochemical cycles can be regarded 
from the viewpoint of various reservoirs, such as oceans, sediments, and the atmosphere, connected 
by conduits through which matter moves continuously among the hydrosphere, atmosphere, geo-
sphere, biosphere, and, increasingly, the anthrosphere. The movement of a specifi  c kind of matter 
between two particular reservoirs may be reversible or irreversible. The fl  ux es o f mo v ement f or 
particular kinds of matter vary greatly as do the contents of such matter in a specifi  ed reservoir. 
Most cycles of matter have a strong biotic component, especially through the biochemical processes

FIGURE 2.1 Illustration of the defi  nition of environmental chemistry by the example of the pollutant sulfu-
ric acid formed by the oxidation of sulfur dioxide generated during the combustion of coal.Chemistry and the Anthrosphere 25
of plants and microorganisms. The cycles in which organisms participate are called biogeochemical 
cycles , which describe the circulation of matter, particularly plant and animal nutrients, through 
ecosystems. Most biogeochemical cycles can be described as elemental cycles involving nutrient 
elements such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur. As part of the carbon cycle, 
atmospheric carbon in CO2 is fi xed as biomass; as part of the nitrogen cycle, atmospheric N2 is fi xed 
in organic matter. The reverse of these kinds of processes is mineralization, in which biologically 
bound elements are returned to inorganic states. Biogeochemical cycles are ultimately powered by 
solar energy, which is fi  ne-tuned and directed by energy expended by organisms. In a sense, the 
solar-energy-powered hydrological cycle (Figure 3.1) acts as an endless conveyer belt to move mate-
rials essential for life through ecosystems. Cycles of matter are also very much involved with the 
chemical fate and transport of pollutants discussed in Section 1.8.
As shown in Figure 2.2, cycles of matter may be divided into two major categories. Exogenic 
cycles  occur largely on the Earth’s surface and are those in which the element in question spends 
part of the cycle in the atmosphere—O2 for oxygen, N2 for nitrogen, and CO2 for carbon . Endogenic 
cycles , notably the sulfur cycle, predominantly involve subsurface rocks of various kinds and are 
without a gaseous component. In general, sediment and soil can be viewed as being shared between 
the two cycles and constitute the predominant interface between them. All sedimentary cycles 
involve salt solutions or soil solutions (see Section 16.2) that contain dissolved substances leached 
from weathered minerals; these substances may be deposited as mineral formations, or they may be 
taken up by organisms as nutrients.
2.2.1 C ARBON  CYCLE
Carbon circulates through the carbon cycle  shown in Figure 2.3. It shows that carbon may be pres-
ent as gaseous atmospheric CO2, constituting a relatively small but highly signifi  cant portion of 
global carbon. Some of the carbon is dissolved in surface water and groundwater as HCO3− or Atmosphere

molecular CO2 (aq). A very large amount of carbon is present in minerals, particularly magnesium 
and calcium carbonates such as CaCO3. Photosynthesis fi  xes inorganic C as biological  carbon , 
represented as {CH2O}, which is a constituent of all life molecules. Another fraction of carbon is 
fi xed as petroleum and natural gas, with a much larger amount as hydrocarbonaceous kerogen (the 
organic matter in oil shale), coal, and lignite. Manufacturing processes are used to convert hydro-
carbons to xenobiotic compounds with functional groups containing halogens,  oxygen, nitrogen, 
phosphorus, or sulfur. Although a very small amount of total environmental carbon, these com-
pounds are particularly signifi  cant because of their toxicological chemical effects.
An important aspect of the carbon cycle is that it is the one by which solar energy is transferred 
to biological systems and ultimately to the geosphere and anthrosphere as fossil carbon and 
 fossil fuels. Organic, or biological, carbon, {CH2O}, is contained in energy-rich molecules that can 
react biochemically with O2, to regenerate carbon dioxide and to produce energy. This can occur 
biochemically in an organism through aerobic respiration as shown in Equation 1.2, or it may occur 
as combustion, such as when wood or fossil fuels are burned.
Microorganisms are strongly involved in the carbon cycle, mediating crucial biochemical 
 reactions discussed later in this section. Photosynthetic algae are the predominant carbon-fi  xing 
agents in water; as they consume CO2 to produce biomass, the pH of the water increases, enabling 
precipitation of CaCO3 and CaCO3 . MgCO3. Biogeochemical processes transform organic carbon 
fi xed by microorganisms to fossil petroleum, kerogen, coal, and lignite. Microorganisms degrade

atmosphere as CO2. Hydrocarbons such as those in crude oil and some synthetic hydrocarbons are 
degraded by microorganisms. This is an important mechanism for eliminating pollutant hydro-
carbons, such as those that are accidentally spilled on soil or in water. Biodegradation also acts to 
destroy carbon-containing compounds in hazardous wastes.CO2  in the atmosphere

reacts with CaCO3. In the atmosphere carbon is present as carbon dioxide, CO2. Atmospheric carbon dioxide 
is fi xed as organic matter by photosynthesis, and organic carbon is released as CO2 by microbial decay of 
organic matter.Chemistry and the Anthrosphere 27
2.2.2 N ITROGEN  CYCLE
As shown in Figure 2.4, nitrogen occurs prominently in all the spheres of the environment. The 
atmosphere is 78% elemental nitrogen, N2, by volume and comprises an inexhaustible reservoir of 
this essential element. Nitrogen, although constituting much less of biomass than carbon or oxygen, 
is an essential constituent of proteins. The N2 molecule is very stable so that breaking it down into 
atoms that can be incorporated with inorganic and organic chemical forms of nitrogen is the limit-
ing step in the nitrogen cycle. This does occur by highly energetic processes in lightning discharges 
that produce nitrogen oxides. Elemental nitrogen is also incorporated into chemically bound forms, 
or fi xed by biochemical processes mediated by microorganisms. The biological nitrogen is mineral-
ized to the inorganic form during the decay of biomass. Large quantities of nitrogen are fi  xed 
 synthetically under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions according to the following over-
all reaction:
 +Æ22 3N3 H 2 N H  (2.1)
The production of gaseous N2 and N2O by microorganisms and the evolution of these gases to the 
atmosphere complete the nitrogen cycle through a process called denitrifi  cation . The nitrogen cycle 
is discussed from the viewpoint of microbial processes in Section 6.11.

2.2.3  OXYGEN  CYCLE
The oxygen cycle  is discussed in Chapter 9 and is illustrated in Figure 9.11. It involves the inter-
change of oxygen between the elemental form of gaseous O2, contained in a huge reservoir in the 
atmosphere, and chemically bound O in CO2, H2O, minerals, and organic matter. It is strongly tied 
with other elemental cycles, particularly the carbon cycle. Elemental oxygen becomes chemically 
bound by various energy-yielding processes, particularly combustion and metabolic processes in 
organisms. It is released in photosynthesis. This element readily combines with and oxidizes other 
species such as carbon in the process of aerobic respiration (Reaction 1.2), or carbon and hydrogen 
in the combustion of fossil fuels such as methane:
 +Æ +42 22CH 2O CO 2H O  (2.2)
Elemental oxygen also oxidizes inorganic substances such as iron(II) in minerals:
 22 3 4FeO O 2Fe O +→  (2.3)
A particularly important aspect of the oxygen cycle is stratospheric ozone, O3. As discussed in 
Chapter 9, Section 9.10, a relatively small concentration of ozone in the stratosphere, more than 
10 km high in the atmosphere, fi  lters out ultraviolet radiation in the wavelength range of 220–330 nm, 
thus protecting life on the Earth from the highly damaging effects of this radiation.
The oxygen cycle is completed by the return of elemental O2 to the atmosphere. The only signifi  cant 
way in which this is done is through photosynthesis mediated by plants. The overall reaction for 
 photosynthesis is given in Reaction 1.1.
2.2.4 P HOSPHORUS  CYCLE
The phosphorus cycle , Figure 2.5, is crucial because phosphorus is usually the limiting nutrient in 
ecosystems. There are no common stable gaseous forms of phosphorus, so the phosphorus cycle 
is endogenic. In the geosphere, phosphorus is held largely in poorly soluble minerals, such as 
hydroxyapatite, a calcium salt, deposits of which constitute the major reservoir of environmental 
phosphate. Soluble phosphorus from phosphate minerals and other sources such as fertilizers is 
taken up by plants and incorporated into nucleic acids that make up the genetic material of organ-
isms. Mineralization of biomass by microbial decay returns phosphorus to the salt solution from 
which it may precipitate as mineral matter.
The anthrosphere is a major reservoir of phosphorus in the environment with large quantities of 
phosphates extracted from phosphate minerals for fertilizer, chemicals, and food additives. 
Phosphorus is a constituent of some extremely toxic compounds, especially organophosphate insec-
ticides and military poison nerve gases including the infamous Sarin and VX (see Chapter 24).
2.2.5 S ULFUR  CYCLE
The sulfur cycle , which is illustrated in Figure 2.6, is relatively complex in that it involves several 
gaseous species, poorly soluble minerals, and several species in solution. It is tied with the oxygen 
cycle in that sulfur combines with oxygen to form gaseous sulfur dioxide, SO2, an atmospheric pol-
lutant, and soluble sulfate ion, SO42−. Among the signifi  cant species involved in the sulfur cycle are 
gaseous hydrogen sulfi  de, H2S ; v olatile dimethyl sulfi  de, (CH3)2S, released to the atmosphere by 
biological processes in the ocean; mineral sulfi  des, such as PbS ; sulfuric acid, H2SO4, the main 
constituent of acid rain; and biologically bound sulfur in sulfur-containing proteins.
Insofar as pollution is concerned, the most signifi  cant part of the sulfur cycle is the presence of 
pollutant SO2 gas and H2SO4 in the atmosphere. The former is a somewhat toxic gaseous air  pollutant Chemistry and the Anthrosphere 29
evolved in the combustion of sulfur-containing fossil fuels. Sulfur dioxide is discussed further as an 
air pollutant in Chapter 11, and its toxicological chemistry is covered in Chapter 24. The major 
detrimental effect of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere is its tendency to oxidize in the atmosphere to 
produce sulfuric acid. This species is responsible for acidic precipitation, “acid rain,” discussed as 
a major atmospheric pollutant in Chapter 14.
2.3 ANTHROSPHERE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY
As the source of most environmental pollution, the anthrosphere has a strong connection with envi-
ronmental chemistry. The anthrosphere may be defi  ned as that part of the environment made or 
modifi  ed by humans and used for their activities. Of course, there are some ambiguities associated 
with that defi  nition. Clearly, a factory building used for manufacture is part of the anthrosphere as 
is an ocean-going ship used to ship goods made in the factory. The ocean on which the ship moves 
belongs to the hydrosphere, but it is clearly used by humans. A pier constructed on the ocean shore 
and used to load the ship is part of the anthrosphere, but it is closely associated with the hydrosphere 
and anchored to the geosphere.
During most of its time on the Earth, humankind made comparatively little impact on the planet. 
Simple huts or tents for dwellings, narrow trails worn across the land for movement, and food gath-
ered largely from nature’s sources affected the environment minimally. Even so, there is evidence 
to suggest that prehistoric humans were beginning to have an impact on nature, probably hunting 
some species to extinction and burning forests to provide grazing land to attract wild game. However, 
with increasing effect as the industrial revolution developed, and especially during the last century, 
humans have built structures and modifi  ed the other environmental spheres, especially the geo-
sphere, such that it is necessary to consider the anthrosphere as a separate area with a pronounced, 
sometimes overwhelming infl  uence on the environment as a whole. The infl  uence of the anthro-
sphere and human activities is so great that some authorities on the environment assert that a Soluble inorganic phosphates,

 transition is under way to a new era, the anthropocene , in which the nature of the Earth’s environ-
ment is largely determined by human activities in the anthrosphere.
2.3.1 C OMPONENTS  OF THE ANTHROSPHERE
Like other spheres of the environment, the anthrosphere consists of a number of different parts. 
These may be categorized by considering where humans live; how they move; how they make or 
provide the things or services they need or want; how they produce food, fi  ber, and wood; how they 
obtain, distribute, and use energy; how they communicate; how they extract and process nonrenew-
able minerals; and how they collect, treat, and dispose of wastes. With these factors in mind, it is 
possible to divide the anthrosphere into the following categories (Figure 2.7):
Structures used for dwellings• 
Structures used for manufacturing, commerce, education, and other activities• 
Utilities, including water, fuel, and electricity distribution systems, and waste distribution • 
systems, such as sewers

From the list given above it is obvious that the anthrosphere is very complex with an enormous 
potential to affect the environment. Prior to addressing these environmental effects, several aspects 
of the anthrosphere will be discussed in more detail.
2.4 TECHNOLOGY AND THE ANTHROSPHERE 
Since the anthrosphere is the result of technology, it is appropriate to discuss technology at this point. 
Technology refers to the ways in which humans do and make things with materials and energy. In the 
modern era, technology is to a large extent the product of engineering based on scientifi  c principles. 
Science deals with the discovery, explanation, and development of theories pertaining to interrelated 
natural phenomena of energy, matter, time, and space. Based on the fundamental knowledge of  science, 
engineering provides the plans and means to achieve specifi  c practical objectives. Technology uses 
these plans to carry out the desired objectives. 
Technology has a long history and, indeed, goes back into prehistory to times when humans 
used primitive tools made from stone, wood, and bone. As humans settled in cities, human and 
material resources became concentrated and focused such that technology began to develop at 
an accelerating pace. Technological advances predating the Roman era include the development 
of metallurgy , beginning with native copper around 4000 bc, domestication of the horse, 
 discovery of the wheel, architecture to enable construction of substantial buildings, control of 
water for canals and irrigation, and writing for communication. The Greek and Roman eras saw 
the development of machines , including the windlass, pulley, inclined plane, screw, catapult for 
throwing missiles in warfare, and water screw for moving water. Later, the water wheel was 
developed for power transmitted by wooden gears. Many technological innovations, such as 
printing with wood blocks starting around the year 740 and gunpowder about a century later, 
originated in China.

The 1800s saw an explosion in technology. Among the major advances during this century were 
widespread use of steam power, steam-powered railroads, the telegraph, telephone, electricity as a 
power source, textiles, the use of iron and steel in building and bridge construction, cement, 
 photography, and the invention of the internal combustion engine, which revolutionized transporta-
tion in the following century.
Since about 1900, advancing technology has been characterized by vastly increased uses of 
energy; much higher speed in manufacturing processes, information transfer, computation, trans-
portation, and communication; automated control; a vast new variety of chemicals; new and 
improved materials for new applications; and, more recently, the widespread application of comput-
ers to manufacturing, communication, and transportation. In transportation, the development of 
passenger-carrying airplanes has enabled an astounding change in the ways in which people get 
around and how high-priority freight is moved. Rapid advances in biotechnology now promise to 
revolutionize food production and medical care.
The technological advances of the 1900s were largely attributable to two factors. The fi  rst of 
these was the application of electronics, now based on solid state devices, to technology in areas 
such as communications, sensors, and computers for manufacturing control. The second area largely 
responsible for modern technological innovations has been based on improved materials. For exam-
ple, special strong light alloys of aluminum were used in the construction of airliners before World 
W ar II and more recently these alloys have been supplanted to a degree by even more advanced 
composites. Synthetic materials with a signifi  cant impact on modern technology include plastics, 
fi ber-reinforced materials, composites, and ceramics. 
Until fairly recently, technological advances were made largely without heed to environmental 
impacts. Now, however, the greatest technological challenge is to reconcile technology with envi-
ronmental consequences. The survival of humankind and of the planet that supports it now requires 
that the established two-way interaction between science and technology become a three-way rela-
tionship including environmental protection and sustainability.
2.4.1 E NGINEERING  
Engineering  uses fundamental knowledge acquired through science to provide the plans and means 
to achieve specifi  c objectives in areas such as manufacturing, communication, and transportation. 
There are many engineering specialties including chemical, electrical, environmental, aerospace, 
agricultural, biomedical, computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM), 
ceramic, industrial, materials, metallurgical, mining, and petroleum engineering. Some other cate-
gories of engineering are defi  ned below.
Mechanical engineering• , which deals with machines and the manner in which they handle 
forces, motion, and power
Electrical engineering•  dealing with the generation, transmission, and utilization of electri-
cal energy
Electronics engineering•  dealing with phenomena based on the behavior of electrons in 
vacuum tubes and other devices
Chemical engineering• , which uses the principles of chemical science, physics, and 
mathematics to design and operate processes that generate products and materials
Civil engineering•  dealing largely with infrastructure components, such as highways, 
airports, and water distribution systems
Environmental engineering•  involving pollution control, waste treatment, and pollution 
prevention
The role of engineering in constructing and operating the various components of the anthro-
sphere is obvious. In the past, engineering was often applied without much, if any, consideration of 
environmental factors. As examples, huge machines designed by mechanical engineers were used Chemistry and the Anthrosphere 33
to dig up and rearrange the Earth’s surface without regard for the environmental consequences, and 
chemical engineering was used to make a broad range of products without consideration of the

friendly engineering include machinery designed to minimize noise, much improved energy effi  -
ciency in machines, and the use of earth-moving equipments for environmentally benefi  cial pur-
poses, such as restoration of strip-mined lands and construction of wetlands. Effi  cient generation, 
distribution, and utilization of electrical energy based on the principles of electrical engineering 
constitute one of the most promising avenues of endeavor leading to environmental improvement. 
Automated factories developed through applications of electronic engineering and controlled by 
computers can turn out goods with the lowest possible consumption of energy and materials while 
minimizing air and water pollutants, production of hazardous wastes, and worker exposure to 
 hazards. Chemical factories can be engineered to maximize the most effi  cient utilization of energy 
and materials while minimizing waste production. In recent years, environmentally friendly and 
sustainable engineering have been formalized as green engineering .2
2.5 INFRASTRUCTURE
The infrastructure  consists of the utilities, facilities, and systems used in common by members 
of a society and upon which the society depends for its normal function. The infrastructure includes 
both physical components—roads, bridges, and pipelines—and the instructions—laws, regula-
tions, and operational procedures—under which the physical infrastructure operates. Parts of the 
 i n f r a s t r u c t u r e  m a y  b e  p u b l i c l y  o w n e d ,  s u c h  a s  t h e  U . S .  I n t e r s t a t e  H i g h w a y  S y s t e m  a n d  s o m e  
European railroads, or privately owned, as is the case with virtually all railroads in the United States. 
Some of the major components of the infrastructure of a modern society are the following.
Transportation systems, including railroads, highways, and air transport systems• 
Energy-generating and distribution systems• 
Buildings• 
Telecommunications systems• 
Water supply and distribution systems• 
Waste treatment and disposal systems, including those for municipal wastewater, municipal • 
solid refuse, and industrial wastes
In general, the infrastructure refers to the facilities that large segments of a population must use 
in common in order for a society to function. In a sense, the infrastructure is analogous to the oper-
ating system of a computer. A computer operating system determines how individual applications 
operate and the manner in which they distribute and store the documents, spreadsheets, illustra-
tions, and communications created by the applications. Similarly, the infrastructure is used to move 
raw materials and power to factories and to distribute and store their output. Just as an outdated, 
cumbersome computer operating system with a tendency to crash is detrimental to the effi  cient 
operation of a computer, an outdated, cumbersome, broken-down infrastructure, which has become 
all to common in many countries including the United States, causes society to operate in a very 
ineffi cient manner and is subject to catastrophic failure.
For a society to be successful, it is of utmost importance to maintain a modern, viable infrastruc-
ture. Such an infrastructure is consistent with environmental protection. Properly designed utilities 
and other infrastructural elements, such as water supply systems and wastewater treatment systems, 
minimize pollution and environmental damage.
Components of the infrastructure are subject to deterioration. To a large extent this is due to 
natural aging processes. Fortunately, many of these processes can be slowed or even reversed. 
Corrosion of steel structures, such as bridges, is a big problem for infrastructures; however, use 
of corrosion-resistant materials and maintenance with corrosion-resistant coatings can virtually 
stop this deterioration process. The infrastructure is subject to human insult, such as vandalism, 34 Environmental Chemistry
misuse, and neglect. Often the problem begins with the design and basic concept of a particular 
component of the infrastructure. For example, many river dikes destroyed by fl  ooding should 
never have been built because they attempt to thwart to an impossible extent the natural tendency 
of rivers to fl  ood periodically.
Technology plays a major role in building and maintaining a successful infrastructure. Many of 
the most notable technological advances applied to the infrastructure were made from 150 to 100 
years ago. By the year 1900, railroads, electric utilities, telephones, and steel building skeletons had 
been developed. The net effect of most of these technological innovations was to enable humankind 
to “conquer” or at least temporarily subdue nature. The telegraph and telephone helped to overcome 
isolation, high-speed rail transport and later air transport conquered distance, and dams were used 
to control rivers and water fl  ow. The development of new and improved materials, such as stronger, 
lighter steel structural elements, continues to have a signifi  cant infl  uence on the infrastructure. 
The major challenge in designing and operating the infrastructure in the future will be to use it 
to work with the environment and to enhance environmental quality to the benefi  t of humankind. 
Obvious examples of environmentally friendly infrastructures are state-of-the-art sewage treatment 
systems, high-speed rail systems that can replace ineffi  cient highway transport, and stack gas emis-
sion control systems in power plants. More subtle approaches with a tremendous potential for mak-
ing the infrastructure more environmentally friendly include employment of workers at computer 
terminals in their homes so that they do not need to commute, instantaneous electronic mail that 
avoids the necessity of moving letters physically, and solar electric-powered installations to operate 
remote signals and relay stations, so that electric power lines do not need to be run to them.
Developments in electronics and computers are enabling signifi  cant advances in infrastructure. 
One of the areas in which the infl  uence of modern electronics and computers is most visible is in 
telecommunications. Dial telephones and mechanical relays were satisfactory in their time, but have 
been made totally obsolete by innovations in electronics, computer control, and fi  ber optics. Air 
transport controlled by a truly modern, state-of-the-art computerized control system can enable 
present airports to handle many more airplanes safely and effi  ciently, thus reducing the need for 
airport construction. Sensors for monitoring strain, temperature, movement, and other parameters 
can be imbedded in the structural members of bridges and other structures. Information from these 
sensors can be processed by computers to warn of failure and to aid in proper maintenance. Many 
similar examples can be cited. 
2.5.1 V ULNERABLE  INFRASTRUCTURE
Almost any part of the infrastructure is vulnerable to attack and disruption. In the modern era, an 
action that disables a segment of infrastructure may cause severe disruptions throughout the system. 
This is because of vulnerability due to interconnectivity , which is a characteristic of modern electri-
cal, transportation, communications, and other infrastructure systems, the components of which are 
interconnected and mutually dependent to an extreme degree. This was illustrated dramatically on 
August 14, 2003, when electrical power was abruptly terminated to tens of millions of people in the 
Northeastern United States and Ontario including the major cities of New York City, Detroit, 
Cleveland, and Toronto. About 100 powerplants, an astounding 68,100 MW of generating capacity, 
and dozens of transmission lines were shut down. All of these facilities stopped operations within 
about 5 min, although the core of the actual event probably occurred within only about 10 s, after 
which the shutdown was irreversible.
The incident that caused the great blackout of August 2003 was so minor that even 2 days later 
experts were not certain of the actual precipitating event. Although it was quickly established that 
the event was not a deliberate incident of terrorism or sabotage, it well could have been and it stands 
as an ominous symbol of the potential of terrorist attacks to disrupt essential infrastructure services. 
This power failure was an illustration of cascading failures  on complex networks. In the case of 
electrical power, hundreds of generating plants are interconnected by power lines and the load is Chemistry and the Anthrosphere 35
continually redistributed to meet fl  uctuating demand. This provides adequate power with much less 
total capacity and hence lower cost than would be the case if individual power plants had to have 
extra capacity to provide for fl  uctuating local demand. The computer Internet works by means of 
many interconnected computing facilities. Routers on the Internet are programmed to redirect traf-
fi c  a r o u n d  m a l f u n c t i o n i n g  r o u t e r s .  M o d e r n  m a n u f a c t u r i n g  o p e r a t i o n s  d e p e n d  o n  “ j u s t - i n - t i m e ”  
delivery of dozens of components. Occasional power outages, Internet failures, and assembly line 
shutdowns due to the lack of an essential part serve as reminders of the vulnerability of such net-
works to cascading failures and the ever-present possibility of sabotage in causing such failures. 
As the complexity of urban infrastructure systems has grown, so has the importance of emer-
gency operations centers in charge of managing damages to the infrastructure that can result in 
disruption. Historically, these centers have dealt with natural disasters such as tornadoes, fl  oods, 
and earthquakes and they have also handled major fi  res, explosions, and building collapses caused 
by human error and design fl  aws. With increased concern over terrorist threats, however, emergency 
operations centers have had to become equipped to deal with attacks. Terrorist attacks that may 
entail highly toxic chemicals, pathogens, or nuclear materials present a special challenge to fi  rst 
responders, who may be put in serious personal danger due to the event.
Fortunately, fi  re and other emergency personnel have long been trained to handle spills and 
releases of toxic and otherwise hazardous substances. Toxic vapors are almost always associated 
with fi  res so that fi  re-fi ghting personnel possess protective and breathing gear that would protect 
them in case of a chemical attack. Military personnel have been trained to respond to attack with 
military poisons and have appropriate gear to protect them from such attack. 
The various elements of the infrastructure are highly connected and interdependent. Perhaps no 
component is more central to the correct functioning of the other elements of the infrastructure than 
the electrical supply. Without electricity, water pumping systems fail and water may become unavail-
able for fi  ghting fi  res. Larger cities with subway systems depend on electricity for moving subway 
trains. Traffi  c light systems require electricity and, without them, traffi  c in urban areas quickly dis-
integrates into chaos and gridlock. Electricity is required to run elevators in large buildings. 
Buildings can also be regarded as part of the essential infrastructure. And buildings are vulner-
able as illustrated most vividly by the September 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center in New 
York in which two huge buildings collapsed due to fi  res from the fuel of impacting aircraft. Other 
examples illustrating the vulnerability of buildings to attack include the 1995 attack on the Murrah 
Federal Building in Oklahoma City, and terrorist attacks on hotels in Mumbai, India, in 2008.
Chemistry certainly has a role to play in protecting infrastructure. Materials that resist attack, 
such as fl  ame-resistant building structural materials, can greatly reduce damage from attack. In 
general those design characteristics that are consistent with the best practices of environmental 
chemistry and green chemistry likewise increase the resistance of elements of the infrastructure to 
attack. Sensitive, portable instruments for the detection of toxic substances and explosives can 
reduce the hazards of these materials to the infrastructure. 
2.6  COMPONENTS OF THE ANTHROSPHERE THAT INFLUENCE 
THE ENVIRONMENT
Several components of the anthrosphere have especially strong infl  uences on the environment. They 
also have enormous potential for modifi  cation and improvement to achieve the goal of sustainabil-
ity. Several of these are mentioned briefl  y here.
Dwellings and buildings• : Although much of the world dwells in substandard housing, a 
large part of the current housing in the United States and other industrialized countries is 
not in keeping with the best practices of sustainability and has a very high environmental 
impact. There is a need to locate dwellings closer to where people work and to commercial 
areas. Homes should be of reasonable size, effi  ciently laid out, and as energy effi  cient as 36 Environmental Chemistry
possible. Buildings should be versatile so that they can be converted to alternate uses 
 without destroying the entire structure. Technological advances can be used to make build-
ings much more environmentally friendly. Advanced window design and effective insulat-
ing materials can signifi  cantly reduce energy consumption. Modern heating and air 
conditioning systems operate with a high degree of effi  ciency. Automated and computer-
ized control of building utilities, particularly those used for cooling and heating, can sig-
nifi c a n t l y  r e d u c e  e n e r g y  c o n s u m p t i o n  b y  r e g u l a t i n g  t e m p e r a t u r e s  a n d  l i g h t i n g  t o  t h e  
desired levels at specifi  c locations and times as needed in the building.
Transportation• : The widespread use of automobiles, trucks, and buses has enormous 
effects on the environment. Entire landscapes have been entirely rearranged to construct 
highways, interchanges, and parking lots. Emissions from the internal combustion engines 
used in automobiles are the major source of air pollution in many urban areas. The  automobile 
has made possible the “urban sprawl” that is characteristic of residential and  commercial 
patterns of development in the United States, and in many other industrialized countries as 
well. Huge new suburban housing tracts and the commercial developments, streets, and 
parking lots constructed to support them continue to consume productive farmland at a 
frightening rate. Applications of advanced engineering and technology to transportation 
can be of tremendous benefi  t to the environment. Modern rail and subway transportation 
systems, concentrated in urban areas and carefully connected to airports for longer  distance 
travel, can enable the movement of people rapidly, conveniently, and safely with minimum 
environmental damage. The telecommuter society , composed of workers who do their 
work at home and “commute” through their computers, modems, fax machines, and the 
Internet connected by way of high-speed communication lines, can  signifi  cantly relieve 
the strain on transportation systems and reduce their adverse environ mental effects. 
Communications• : The major areas to consider with respect to information are its acquisi-
tion, recording, computing, storing, displaying, and transmission. All these have been tre-
mendously augmented by recent technological advances. Perhaps the greatest such advance 
has been that of silicon-integrated circuits. Optical memory consisting of information 
recorded and read by microscopic beams of laser light has enabled the storage of astound-
ing quantities of information on a single compact disk. The use of optical fi  bers to transmit 
information digitally by light has resulted in a comparable advance in the communication 
of information. The central characteristic of communication in the modern age is the com-
bination of telecommunications with computers called telematics,  such as is employed in 
automatic bank teller machines. An important capability in modern communications is the 
ability to rapidly and accurately acquire, analyze, and communicate information about the 
environment.
Food and agriculture• : The environmental impact of agriculture is enormous. One of the 
most rapid and profound changes in the environment that has ever taken place was the 
conversion of vast areas of the North American continent from forests and grasslands to 
cropland, which occurred predominantly during the 1800s. This enabled the production of 
huge amounts of food but also resulted in damaging water and wind erosion. Recognition 
of these problems led to intense soil conservation efforts starting around 1900 and continu-
ing to the present. In recent decades, valuable farmland has faced the threat posed by the 
urbanization of rural areas—urban sprawl—as prime agricultural land has been turned 
into subdivisions and paved over to create parking lots and streets. Increasing population 
and higher living standards will put more pressure on the agricultural resources. It is likely 
that production of synthetic fuels from biomass will also increase the demands on the agri-
cultural sector. Global warming and resulting climate change will likely have profound 
effects on agriculture.
Manufacturing• : The manufacture of goods carries with it the potential to cause signifi  -
cant air and water pollution and production of hazardous wastes. The earlier in the design Chemistry and the Anthrosphere 37
and development process that environmental considerations are taken into account, the 
more “environmentally friendly” a manufacturing process will be. Application of the 
principles of industrial ecology and green chemistry can greatly increase the sustainabi-
lity of manufacturing. Three relatively new developments that have revolutionized manu-
facturing and that continue to do so are automation, robotics, and computers. Automation  
uses automatic devices to perform repetitive tasks such as assembly line operations. 
Robotics refers to the use of machines to simulate human movements and activities. CAD 
is employed to convert an idea to a manufactured product, replacing innumerable sketches, 
engineering drawings, and physical mockups that used to be employed. CAM uses com-
puters to plan and control manufacturing operations, for quality control, and to manage 
entire manufacturing plants. This increases the effi  ciency of manufacturing and contri-
butes to sustainability.
2.7 EFFECTS OF THE ANTHROSPHERE ON EARTH
The effects of the anthrosphere on Earth have been many and profound. Persistent and potentially 
harmful products of human activities have been widely dispersed and concentrated in specifi  c 
locations in the anthrosphere as well as other spheres of the environment as the result of human 
activities. Among the most troublesome of these are toxic heavy metals and organochlorine com-
pounds. Such materials have accumulated in the anthrosphere in painted and coated surfaces, such 
as organotin-containing paints used to prevent biofouling on boats; under and adjacent to airport 
runways; under and along highway paving; buried in old factory sites; in landfi  lls; and in materials 
dredged from waterways and harbors that are sometimes used as landfi  ll on which buildings, air-
port runways, and other structures have been placed. In many cases, productive topsoil used to 
grow food has been contaminated with discarded industrial wastes, phosphate fertilizers, and 
dried sewage sludge containing levels of metals harmful to crops.

FIGURE 2.8 The anthrosphere is a repository of many of the pollutant by-products of human activities.38 Environmental Chemistry
Some of the portions of the anthrosphere that may be severely contaminated by human activities 
are shown in Figure 2.8. In some cases the contamination has been so pervasive and persistent 
that the effects will remain for centuries. Some of the most vexsome environmental and waste 
 problems are due to contamination of various parts of the anthrosphere by persistent and toxic 
waste materials.
Potentially harmful wastes and pollutants of anthrospheric origin have found their way into 
water, air, soil, and living organisms. For example, chlorofl  uorocarbons (CFCs) (Freons) have been 
released to the atmosphere in such quantities and are so stable that they are now constituents of 
“normal” atmospheric air and pose a threat to the protective ozone layer in the stratosphere. Lake 
sediments, stream beds, and deltas deposited by fl  owing rivers are contaminated with heavy metals 
and refractory organic compounds of anthrospheric origin. The most troubling repository of wastes 
in the hydrosphere is groundwater. Some organisms have accumulated high enough levels of persis-
tent organic compounds or heavy metals to do harm to themselves or to humans who use them as a 
food source.
2.8  INTEGRATION OF THE ANTHROSPHERE INTO 
THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
Over the eons of the Earth’s existence, natural processes free from sudden, catastrophic distur-
bances (such as those that have occurred from massive asteroid impacts, for example) have resulted 
in a fi nely tuned balance among the systems composing the Earth’s natural environment. Fortuitously, 
these conditions—adequate water, moderate temperatures, and an atmosphere that serves as a shield 
a g a i n s t  d a m a g i n g  s o l a r  r a d i a t i o n — h a v e  r e s u l t e d  i n  c o n d i t i o n s  a m e n a b l e  t o  v a r i o u s  l i f e  f o r m s .  
Indeed, these life forms have had a strong impact in changing their own environments. According 
to the Gaia hypothesis advanced by the British chemist James Lovelock, organisms on the Earth 
have modifi  ed the Earth’s climate and other environmental conditions, such as by regulating the 
CO2/O2 balance in the atmosphere, in a manner conducive to the existence and reproduction of the 
organisms.
To a degree, the early anthrosphere created by preindustrial humans caused minimal environ-
mental degradation. The relatively harmonious relationship between the anthrosphere and the rest 
of the environment existed so long as the energy required to alter the environment came mainly 
from human and animal muscle power. This situation began to change markedly with the introduc-
tion of machines, particularly power sources, beginning with the steam engine, that greatly multi-
plied the capabilities of humans to alter their surroundings. As humans developed their use of 
machines and other attributes of industrialized civilization, they did so with little consideration of 
the environment and in a way that was out of synchronization with the other environmental spheres. 
A massive environmental imbalance has resulted, the magnitude of which has been realized only in 
recent decades. The most commonly cited manifestation of this imbalance has been pollution of air 
or water. 
Because of the detrimental effects of human activities undertaken without due consideration of 
environmental consequences, signifi  c a n t  e f f o r t s  h a v e  b e e n  m a d e  t o  r e d u c e  t h e  e n v i r o n m e n t a l  
impacts of these activities. Figure 2.9 shows three stages of the evolution of the anthrosphere from 
an unintegrated appendage to the natural environment to a system more attuned to its surroundings. 
The fi  rst approach to dealing with the pollutants and wastes produced by industrial  activities— 
 particulate matter from power plant stacks, sulfur dioxide from copper smelters, and mercury-con-
taminated wastes from chlor-alkali manufacture—was to ignore them. However, as smoke from 
uncontrolled factory furnaces, raw sewage, and other by-products of human activities became more 
troublesome, “end-of-pipe” measures were adopted to prevent the release of  pollutants after they 
were generated. Such measures have included electrostatic precipitators and fl  ue gas desulfurization 
to remove particulate matter and sulfur dioxide from fl  ue gas; physical processes used in primary 
sewage treatment; microbial processes used for secondary sewage treatment; and physical,  chemical, Chemistry and the Anthrosphere 39
and biological processes for advanced (tertiary) sewage treatment. Such treatment measures are 
often very sophisticated and effective. Another kind of end-of-pipe treatment is the disposal of 
wastes in a supposedly safe place. In some cases, such as municipal solid wastes, radioactive materi-
als, hazardous chemicals, power plant ash, and contaminated soil, the disposal of sequestered wastes 
in a secure location is practiced as a direct treatment process. In other cases, including fl  ue-gas 
desulfurization sludge, sewage sludge, and sludge from chemical treatment of industrial wastewater, 
disposal is practiced as an adjunct to other end-of-pipe measures. Waste disposal practices later 
found to be inadequate have spawned an entirely separate end-of-pipe treatment activity called 
remediation  in which discarded wastes are dug up, sometimes subjected to additional treatment, 
and then placed in a more secure disposal site. 
Although sometimes unavoidable, the production of pollutants followed by measures taken to con-
trol or remediate them to reduce the quantities and potential harmfulness of wastes are not very desir-
able. Such measures do not usually eliminate wastes and may, in fact, transfer a waste problem from 
one part of the environment to another. An example of this is the removal of air pollutants from stack 
gas and their disposal as wastes on land, where they have the potential to cause groundwater pollution. 
Clearly, it is now unacceptable to ignore pollution and to dump wastes, and the control of pollutants 
and wastes after they are produced is not a good permanent solution to waste problems. Therefore, it 
has become accepted practice to “close the loop” on industrial processes, recycling materials as much 
as possible and allowing only benign waste products to be released to the environment.
2.8.1 A NTHROSPHERE  AND INDUSTRIAL  ECOLOGY
“Closing the loop” on industrial processes is the basis of industrial ecology and one of the most 
effective ways of integrating the anthrosphere into the total environment. Discussed in detail in 
Chapter 17, industrial ecology is practiced when industrial enterprises interact in a mutually advan-
tageous manner to produce goods and services with maximum effi  ciency and with minimum envi-
ronmental impact. Although practiced in rudimentary forms ever since industrial production began, 
modern practice of industrial ecology dates from a 1989 article by Frosch and Gallopoulos.3 
Industrial ecology is carried out in industrial ecosystems  analogous to natural ecosystems. The 
processing of matter and energy through industrial ecosystems is known as industrial metabolism . 
The effi  cient practice of industrial ecology is a crucial aspect of modern environmental chemistry.

2.9 GREEN CHEMISTRY
As the modern environmental movement developed since around 1970, enormous progress has been 
made in environmental quality. This has been done largely through a command and control  approach 
based on laws and regulations. Many of the measures taken to reduce pollution have been “end-of-
pipe” measures in which water and air pollutants were produced but removed before discharge to 
the environment. However, in those countries with good, well-enforced pollution control regula-
tions, most of the easy measures in pollution control have been taken and small additional reduc-
tions in pollutant emissions require high expenditures. Furthermore, enforcement is a continuous, 
expensive, and often litigious challenge.
It has become obvious that, to the extent possible, systems are needed that are inherently nonpol-
luting and sustainable. Starting in the 1990s, this need has been approached through a system known 
as green chemistry. Green chemistry  can be defi  ned as the sustainable, safe, and nonpolluting prac-
tice of chemical science and manufacturing in a manner that consumes minimum amounts of mate-
rials and energy while producing little or no waste material . In a word, green chemistry is sustainable 
chemistry .4 Green chemistry is based on “the 12 principles of green chemistry”5 addressed below.
 1. Minimize or eliminate the need for waste cleanup by emphasizing waste prevention.
 2. To the extent possible, all materials involved in making a product should be incorporated 
into it. This rule involves the key concept of atom economy discussed below.
 3. Avoid the use and generation of hazardous substances that may harm humans or the 
environment.
 4. Design and use chemical products that have minimum toxicity.
 5. Minimize or eliminate the use of auxiliary substances that do not become part of the 
fi n a l  p r o d u c t .  S o l v e n t s  a r e  e x a m p l e s  o f  s u c h  s u b s t a n c e s  t h a t  s h o u l d  b e  a v o i d e d  i f  
possible.
 6. Minimize energy consumption.
 7. Use renewable raw materials instead of depletable feedstocks. For example, biomass raw 
material, which can be produced renewably by plants, is preferable to petroleum, of which 
there is a fi  nite supply.
 8. In organic synthesis, the use of protecting groups should be avoided because the material 
used in such groups does not become part of the fi  nal product.
 9. Reagents should be chosen for maximum selectivity of function.

 11. Manufacturing processes should be monitored and controlled in-process and in real time 
with appropriate computerized systems.
 12. Processes and materials that are likely to cause extreme temperatures or pressures or 
unforeseen incidents such as explosions, runaway reactions, and fi  res should be avoided.
2.9.1 G REEN SYNTHETIC  CHEMISTRY
Much of what is known as green chemistry to date has been applied to synthetic chemistry , which is 
involved with the production of new and existing chemical products. In recent times, the costs of 
making chemical products have come to include substantial expenses beyond those associated with 
raw materials, energy, production, and marketing. Among these added costs are those of regulatory 
compliance, treatment and disposal of waste by-products, liability, and, more recently, operation of 
security measures to provide protection from the threats of terrorism. Ideally, the practice of green 
chemistry greatly reduces these added costs by avoiding hazardous feedstocks and catalysts, elimi-
nating the generation of dangerous intermediates and by-products, and avoiding severe conditions 
that might lead to hazards.Chemistry and the Anthrosphere 41
A key concept of green synthetic chemistry is that of high atom economy . In conventional synthesis, 
a high yield is obtained when the reaction making the product goes to completion. But even with 100% 
yield, by-products inherent to the synthesis may be generated posing disposal problems. Atom econ-
omy refers to the fraction of all reagents that go into the fi  nal product. Ideally, all materials that go into 
a synthetic process would be incorporated into the product, resulting in 100% atom economy.
2.9.2 R ISK REDUCTION
Risk reduction  is an important goal of any manufacturing process and the products that are gener-
ated and marketed. In all cases risks should be minimized to workers, the surrounding community, 
customers, and the environment as a whole. Risk is a function of hazard  and exposure :
 Risk {hazard exposure} F=¥  (2.4)
In past times, emphasis has been placed on reduction of exposure. For example, hazardous still bot-
toms from the distillation of a toxic insecticide have been placed in “secure” landfi  lls to prevent 
exposure to the environment. The practice of green chemistry reduces the hazard by substituting 
insecticides whose synthesis does not generate such hazardous by-products.
2.9.3 S PECIFIC  ASPECTS  OF GREEN CHEMISTRY
During its brief lifetime as a recognized discipline, green chemistry has seen the development of 
several specifi  c kinds of processes and products that can fairly be deemed to be “green.” Since the 
discipline is still developing, new aspects are recognized each year. Several established specifi  c 
aspects of green chemistry are those listed below.
 1. Chemical transformations under mild conditions : Many chemical processes are carried 
out under conditions of high temperature and high pressure using potentially hazardous 
catalysts and media (solvents) that may present hazards. Enzymatic transformations using 
biological catalysts (enzymes) must occur under mild conditions and, wherever possible, 
are being substituted for more established harsh conditions.
 2. Green catalysts : These are catalysts with maximum specifi  city and effi  ciency that do not 
themselves pose major hazards. Appropriate catalysts reduce energy and material require-
ments, decrease the need for separations because of their higher selectivity, and permit the 
use of less toxic reagents, such as H2O2, in place of more hazardous reagents, such as those 
containing heavy metals.
 3. Solventless processes : Since many of the hazards and environmental problems associated 
with chemical processes arise from the use of solvents, processes that do not use solvents 
are favored.
 4. Less dangerous and polluting solvents : Benign solvents, especially water, are favored for 
operations that require solvents.
 5. Supercritical fl  uids : Supercritical carbon dioxide often provides good reaction media and 
makes product separation easier.
 6. Process intensifi  cation : Small reactors such as channeled microreactors, spinning disc 
reactors, and tube-in-tube reactors can concentrate a chemical process in a small volume 
r e d u c i n g  t h e  h a z a r d  p o s e d  b y  r e a c t i n g  l a r g e  q u a n t i t i e s  o f  m a t e r i a l  i n  l a r g e - v o l u m e  
containers.
 7. Electricity : In some cases, addition of electrons (reduction) and removal of electrons (oxi-
dation) can be accomplished with electricity, a mass-less reagent that is cheap (only a few 
cents per mole) and easy to transport.42 Environmental Chemistry
 8. Renewable feedstocks : The chemical industry is based largely on petroleum feedstocks, 
which inevitably will become much less available and in short supply. Biomass sources from 
plants are being developed to substitute for petroleum and natural gas raw materials.
 9. Design for degradability : Products that will be released into the environment are being 
designed for maximum degradability so that any hazard that they might present is transient 
and eliminated by natural processes.
 10. Biodegradable polymers : Polymers used in textiles, plastic bags, and a vast number of 
other applications are likely to be discarded into the environment. Therefore, these poly-
mers should be biodegradable. Biochemically synthesized polymeric materials including 
those from carbohydrate feedstocks are especially amenable to biodegradation.
2.9.4  THREE UNDESIRABLE  CHARACTERISTICS  OF CHEMICALS : PERSISTENCE , 
BIOACCUMULATION , AND TOXICITY
Green chemistry seeks to avoid substances that are most likely to cause problems in the environment, 
including those that (1) are persistent, (2) have a strong tendency to undergo bioaccumulation, and 
(3) are toxic. Basically, these are materials that stay around for a long time; accumulate in organisms, 
particularly the lipid tissues of animals; and once inside an organism are toxic to the host. Some of the 
once commonly used organohalide pesticides meet all three of these criteria. Certainly, DDT is per-
sistent in the environment, undergoes biomagnifi  cation in the food chain, and is toxic, through inter-
ference with reproductive processes, to birds of prey at the top of the food chain. Insecticidal parathion 
is quite toxic but its danger to the environment is relatively lower because it is readily biodegraded.
Through years of careful study and often unfortunate experience, the persistence/bioaccumulation/
toxicity (PBT) characteristics of a number of common chemicals have become well established. The 
body of knowledge gathered from studies of such chemicals combined with increasingly sophisticated 
tools relating chemical structures to characteristics of substances has led to new ways to predict which 
chemicals may be troublesome. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has published a comput-
erized PBT Profi  ler designed to predict undesirable PBT behavior.6 Although not a substitute for care-
ful experimental study, this tool is helpful in warning of possible problems with new chemicals that 
may be introduced into the environment.
2.9.5 G REEN CHEMISTRY  AND ENVIRONMENTAL  CHEMISTRY
Green chemistry and environmental chemistry are closely linked. In order to develop green chemical 
processes, environmental chemistry must be carefully considered to know how these processes and 
their products will affect the environment. Environmental chemistry’s goal of environmental protection 
can best be accomplished by the implementation of green chemistry. Green chemistry is closely linked 
with the practice of industrial ecology; both of these topics are discussed in more detail in Chapter 17.

Chemistry
3.1 IMPORTANCE OF WATER
Throughout history, the quality and quantity of water available to humans have been vital factors in 
determining their well-being. Whole civilizations have disappeared because of water shortages result-
ing from changes in climate. Even in temperate climates, fl  uctuations in precipitation cause problems. 
Devastating droughts and destructive fl  oods are frequent occurrences in many areas of the world.
Waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid killed millions of people in the past and still cause 
great misery in less developed countries. Ambitious programs of dam and dike construction have 
reduced fl  ood damage, but they have had a number of undesirable side effects in some areas, such as 
inundation of farmland by reservoirs and failure of unsafe dams. Globally, problems with quantity and 
quality of water supply remain and in some respects are becoming more serious. These problems 
include increased water use due to population growth, contamination of drinking water by improperly 
discarded hazardous wastes (see Chapter 20), and destruction of wildlife by water pollution.
Aquatic chemistry, the subject of this chapter, must consider water in rivers, lakes, estuaries, oceans, 
and underground, as well as the phenomena that determine the distribution and circulation of chemical 
species in natural waters. Its study requires some understanding of the sources, transport, characteristics, 
and composition of water. The chemical reactions that occur in water and the chemical species found in 
it are strongly infl  uenced by the environment in which the water is found. The chemistry of water 
exposed to the atmosphere is quite different from that of water at the bottom of a lake. Microorganisms 
play an essential role in determining the chemical composition of water. Thus, in discussing water 
chemistry, it is necessary to consider the many general factors that infl  uence this chemistry.
The study of water is known as hydrology  and is divided into a number of subcategories. 
Limnology is the branch of the science dealing with the characteristics of freshwater including 
biological properties, as well as chemical and physical properties. Oceanography is the science of 
the ocean and its physical and chemical characteristics. The chemistry and biology of the Earth’s 
vast oceans are unique because of the ocean’s high salt content, great depth, and other factors.
Water and the hydrosphere are crucial in the processes involved with chemical fate and transport 
in the environment. These include the physical processes of volatilization, dissolution, precipitation, 
and uptake and release by sediments. The chemical processes involved with chemical fate and trans-
port in water are chemical reactions that result in dissolution or precipitation, hydrolysis, complex-
ation, oxidation–reduction, and photochemical reactions. These processes are very much infl  uenced 
by biochemical phenomena such as bioaccumulation and magnifi  cation in food chains and biodeg-
radation. The fate and transport of pollutants in the hydrosphere are very important (Chapter 7).
3.2 WATER: FROM MOLECULES TO OCEANS
3.2.1 S OURCES  AND USES OF WATER: THE HYDROLOGICAL  CYCLE
The world’s water supply is found in the fi  ve parts of the hydrologic cycle (Figure 3.1). About 97% 
of the Earth’s water is found in the oceans. Another fraction is present as water vapor in the 48 Environmental Chemistry
 atmosphere (clouds). Some water is contained in the solid state as ice and snow in snowpacks, gla-
ciers, and the polar ice caps. Surface water is found in lakes, streams, and reservoirs. Groundwater 
is located in aquifers underground.
There is a strong connection between the hydrosphere, where water is found, and the lithosphere, 
which is that part of the geosphere accessible to water. Human activities affect both. For example, distur-
bance of land by conversion of grasslands or forests to agricultural land or intensifi  cation of agricultural 
production may reduce vegetation cover, decreasing transpiration (loss of water vapor by plants) and 
affecting the microclimate. The result is increased rain runoff, erosion, and accumulation of silt in bodies 
of water. The nutrient cycles may be accelerated, leading to nutrient enrichment of surface waters. This, 
in turn, can profoundly affect the chemical and biological characteristics of bodies of water.
The water that humans use is primarily fresh surface water and groundwater, the sources of 
which may differ from each other signifi  cantly. In arid regions, a small fraction of the water supply 
comes from the ocean, a source that will continue to increase as the world’ s supply of freshwater 
dwindles relative to demand. Saline or brackish groundwaters can also be utilized in some areas.
In the continental United States, an average of approximately 1.48 ¥ 1013 L of water fall as pre-
cipitation each day, which translates to 76 cm/yr. Of that amount, approximately 1.02 ¥ 1013 L/day, 
or 53 cm/yr, are lost by evaporation and transpiration. Thus, the water theoretically available for 
use is approximately 4.6 ¥ 1012 L / d a y ,  o r  o n l y  2 3  c m / y r .  A t  p r e s e n t ,  t h e  U n i t e d  S t a t e s  u s e s  
1.6 ¥ 1012 L/day, or 8 cm of the average annual precipitation. This amounts to an almost 10-fold 
increase from a usage of 1.66 ¥ 1011 L/day in 1900. Even more striking is the per capita increase 
from about 40 L/day in 1900 to around 600 L/day now. Much of this increase is accounted for by 
high agricultural and industrial use, which each account for approximately 46% of total consump-
tion. Municipal use consumes the remaining 8%.
Starting around 1980, however, the increase in water use in the United States slowed signifi  -
cantly. This trend, which is illustrated in Figure 3.2, has been attributed to the success of efforts to 
conserve water, especially in the industrial (including power generation) and agricultural sectors. 
Conservation and recycling have accounted for much of the decreased use in the industrial sector. 
Irrigation water has been used much more effi  ciently by replacing spray irrigators, which lose large 
quantities of water to the action of wind and to evaporation, with irrigation systems that apply water

directly to soil. Trickle irrigation systems that apply just the amount of water needed directly to 
plant roots are especially effi  cient.
A major problem with water supply is its nonuniform distribution with location and time. As 
shown in Figure 3.3, precipitation falls unevenly in the continental United States. This causes 
 diffi culties because people in areas with low precipitation often consume more water than people 
in regions with more rainfall. Rapid population growth in the more arid southwestern states of the 
United States during recent decades has further aggravated the problem. Water shortages are becom-
ing more acute in this region, which contains six of the nation’s 11 largest cities (Los Angeles, 
Houston, Dallas, San Diego, Phoenix, and San Antonio). Other problem areas include Florida, 
where overdevelopment of coastal areas threatens Lake Okeechobee; the Northeast, plagued by 
deteriorating water systems; and the High Plains, ranging from the Texas panhandle to Nebraska, Year

Africa where water shortages are contributing to real famine conditions.
3.2.2 P ROPERTIES  OF WATER, A UNIQUE  SUBSTANCE
Water has a number of unique properties that are essential to life. Some of the special characteristics 
of water include its polar character, tendency to form hydrogen bonds, and ability to hydrate metal 
ions. These properties are listed in Table 3.1.
3.2.3 W ATER MOLECULE
Water’s properties can best be understood by considering the structure and bonding of the water 
molecule shown in Figure 3.4. The water molecule is made up of two hydrogen atoms bonded to an 
oxygen atom. The three atoms are not in a straight line; instead, as shown above, they form an angle 
of 105°. Because of water’s bent structure and the fact that the oxygen atom attracts the negative 
electrons more strongly than do the hydrogen atoms, the water molecule behaves like a dipole having 
opposite electrical charges at either end. The water dipole may be attracted to either positively or 
negatively charged ions. For example, when NaCl dissolves in water as positive Na+ ions and negative 
Cl- ions, the positive sodium ions are surrounded by water molecules with their negative ends pointed 
at the ions, and the chloride ions are surrounded by water molecules with their positive ends pointing 
at the negative ions, as shown in Figure 3.4. This kind of attraction for ions is the reason why water 
dissolves many ionic compounds and salts that do not dissolve in other liquids.
A second important characteristic of the water molecule is its ability to form hydrogen bonds. 
Hydrogen bonds  are a special type of bond that can form between the hydrogen in one water mol-
ecule and the oxygen in another water molecule. This bonding takes place because the oxygen has 
a partial negative charge and the hydrogen a partial positive charge. Hydrogen bonds, shown in 
Figure 3.5 as dashed lines, hold the water molecules together in large groups.
Hydrogen bonds also help to hold some solute molecules or ions in solution. This happens when 
hydrogen bonds form between the water molecules and hydrogen, nitrogen, or oxygen atoms on the 
solute molecule (see Figure 3.5). Hydrogen bonding also aids in retaining extremely small particles 
called colloidal particles in suspension in water (see Section 5.4).

Water is an excellent solvent for many materials; thus it is the basic transport medium for nutrients 
and waste products in life processes. The extremely high dielectric constant of water relative to other 
liquids has a profound effect upon its solvent properties in that most ionic materials are dissociated 
in water. With the exception of liquid ammonia, water has the highest heat capacity of any liquid or 
solid, 4.186 J/g/deg (l cal/g/deg). Because of this hi gh heat capacity, a relatively large amount of heat 
is required to change appreciably the temperature of a mass of water; hence, a body of water can have 
a stabilizing eff ect upon the temperature of nearby geographic regions. In addition, this property 
prevents sudden large changes of temperature in large bodies of water and thereby protects aquatic 
organisms from the shock of abrupt temperature variations. The extremely high heat of vaporization 
of water, 2446 J/g at 25°C, likewise stabilizes the temperature of bodies of water and the surrounding 
geographic regions. It also infl  uences the transfer of heat and water vapor between bodies of water 
and the atmosphere. Water has its maximum density at 4°C, a temperature above its freezing point. 
The fortunate consequence of this fact is that ice fl  oats, so that few large bodies of water ever 
freeze solid. Furthermore, the pattern of vertical circulation of water in lakes, a determining factor 
in their chemistry and biology, is governed largely by the unique temperature–density relationship 
of water.Na+ Cl–

3.3 CHARACTERISTICS OF BODIES OF WATER
The physical condition of a body of water strongly infl  uences the chemical and biological processes 
that occur in water. Surface water  occurs primarily in streams, lakes, and reservoirs. Wetlands are 
fl ooded areas in which the water is shallow enough to enable growth of bottom-rooted plants. 
Estuaries are arms of the ocean into which streams fl  ow. The mixing of fresh and salt water gives 
estuaries unique chemical and biological properties. Estuaries are the breeding grounds of much 
marine life, which makes their preservation very important.
Water’s unique temperature–density relationship results in the formation of distinct layers within 
nonfl owing bodies of water, as shown in Figure 3.6. During the summer a surface layer ( epilimnion ) 
is heated by solar radiation and, because of its lower density, fl  o a t s  u p o n  t h e  b o t t o m  l a y e r ,  o r  
hypolimnion . This phenomenon is called thermal stratifi  cation . When an appreciable temperature 
difference exists between the two layers, they do not mix but behave independently and have very 
different chemical and biological properties. Exposed to sunlight, the epilimnion may have a heavy 
growth of algae. As a result of exposure to the atmosphere and (during daylight hours) because of 
the photosynthetic activity of algae, the epilimnion contains relativ ely higher lev els of dissolv ed 
o x y g e n  ( D O )  a n d ,  g e n e r a l l y ,  i s  a e r o b i c .  I n  t h e  h y p o l i m n i o n ,  b a c t e r i a l  a c t i o n  o n  b i o d e g r a d a b l e  
organic material may cause the water to become anaerobic (lacking DO). As a consequence, chemi-
cal  species in a relatively reduced form tend to predominate in the hypolimnion.
The shear plane, or layer between epilimnion and hypolimnion, is called the metalimnion  or 
 thermocline . During autumn, when the epilimnion cools, a point is reached at which the temperatures 
of the epilimnion and hypolimnion are equal. This disappearance of thermal stratifi  cation causes 
the entire body of water to behave as a hydrological unit, and the resultant mixing is known as  overturn . 
An overturn also generally occurs in the spring. During the overturn, the chemical and physical char-
acteristics of the body of water become much more uniform, and a number of chemical, physical, and 
biological changes may result. Biological activity may increase from the mixing of nutrients. Changes 
in water composition during overturn may cause disruption in water treatment processes.
3.4 AQUATIC LIFE
The living organisms ( biota ) in an aquatic ecosystem may be classifi  ed as e i ther au totro p hi c or 
 heterotrophic. Autotrophic  organisms utilize solar or chemical energy to fi  x elements from simple, 
nonliving inorganic material into complex life molecules that compose living organisms. Algae are 
the most important autotrophic aquatic organisms because they are producers  that utilize solar 
energy to generate biomass from CO2 and other simple inorganic species.

Heterotrophic organisms utilize the organic substances produced by autotrophic organisms as 
energy sources and as the raw materials for the synthesis of their own biomass. Decomposers (or 
reducers ) are a subclass of the heterotrophic organisms and consist of chiefl  y bacteria and fungi, 
which ultimately break down material of biological origin to the simple compounds originally fi  xed 
by the autotrophic organisms.
The ability of a body of water to produce living material is known as its productivity . Productivity 
results from a combination of physical and chemical factors. High productivity requires an adequate 
supply of carbon (CO2), nitrogen (nitrate), phosphorus (orthophosphate), and trace elements such as 
iron. Water of low productivity generally is desirable for water supply or for swimming. Relatively 
high productivity is required for the support of fi  sh and to serve as the basis of the food chain in an 
aquatic ecosystem. Excessive productivity results in decay of the biomass produced, consumption 
of DO, and odor production, a condition called eutrophication .
Life forms higher than algae and bacteria—fi  sh, for example—comprise a comparatively small 
fraction of the biomass in most aquatic systems. The infl  uence of these higher life forms upon 
aquatic chemistry is minimal. However, aquatic life is strongly infl  uenced by the physical and 
chemical properties of the body of water in which it lives. Temperature , transparency , and turbu-
lence  are the three main physical properties affecting aquatic life. Very low water temperatures 
result in very slow biological processes, whereas very high temperatures are fatal to most organ-
isms. The transparency of water is particularly important in determining the growth of algae. 
Turbulence is an important factor in mixing processes and transport of nutrients and waste products 
in water. Some small organisms ( plankton ) depend upon water currents for their own mobility.
DO frequently is the key substance in determining the extent and kinds of life in a body of water. 
Oxygen defi  ciency is fatal to many aquatic animals such as fi  sh. The presence of oxygen can be 
equally fatal to many kinds of anaerobic bacteria. Biochemical oxygen demand , BOD , discussed as 
a water pollutant in Section 7.9, refers to the amount of oxygen utilized when the organic matter in 
a given volume of water is degraded biologically.
Carbon dioxide is produced by respiratory processes in water and sediments and can also enter 
water from the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is required for the photosynthetic production of biomass 
by algae and, in some cases, is a limiting factor . High levels of carbon dioxide produced by the 
d egradation of organic matter in water can cause excessive algal growth and biomass productivity.
The salinity of water also determines the kinds of life forms present. Irrigation waters may pick 
up harmful levels of salt. Marine life obviously requires or tolerates salt water, whereas many fresh-
water organisms are intolerant of salt.
3.5 INTRODUCTION TO AQUATIC CHEMISTRY
To understand water pollution, it is fi  rst necessary to have an appreciation of chemical phenomena 
that occur in water. The remaining sections of this chapter discuss aquatic acid–base and complex-
ation phenomena. Oxidation–reduction reactions and equilibria are discussed in Chapter 4, and the 
details of solubility calculations and interactions between liquid water and other phases are given in 
Chapter 5. The main categories of aquatic chemical phenomena are illustrated in Figure 3.7.
Aquatic environmental chemical phenomena involve processes familiar to chemists, including 
acid–base, solubility, oxidation–reduction, and complexation reactions.1 A l t h o u g h  m o s t  a q u a t i c  
chemical phenomena are discussed here from the thermodynamic (equilibrium) viewpoint, it is 
important to keep in mind that reaction rates (kinetics) are very important in aquatic chemistry. 
Biological processes play a key role in aquatic chemistry. For example, algae undergoing photo-
synthesis can raise the pH of water by removing aqueous CO2, thereby converting an HCO3- ion to a 
CO32- ion; this ion in turn reacts with Ca2+ in water to precipitate CaCO3.

describe chemical phenomena in natural water systems. Such systems are very complex and a description 
of their chemistry must take many variables into consideration. In addition to water, these systems  contain 54 Environmental Chemistry
 mineral phases, gas phases, and organisms. As open, dynamic systems, they have variable inputs and out-
puts of energy and mass. Therefore, except under unusual  circumstances, a true equilibrium condition is 
not obtained, although an approximately steady-state aquatic system frequently exists. Most metals found 
in natural waters do not exist as simple hydrated cations in the water, and oxyanions often are found as 
polynuclear species, rather than as simple monomers. The nature of chemical species in water containing 
bacteria or algae is strongly infl  uenced by the action of these organisms. Thus, an exact description of the 
chemistry of a natural water system based upon acid–base, solubility, and complexation equilibrium 
constants, redox potential, pH, and other chemical parameters is not possible. Therefore, the systems 
must be described by simplifi  ed models , often based around equilibrium chemical concepts. Though not 
exact, nor entirely realistic, such models can yield useful generalizations and insights pertaining to the 
nature of aquatic chemical processes, and provide guidelines for the description and measurement of 
natural water systems. Though greatly simplifi  ed, such models are very helpful in visualizing the condi-
tions that determine chemical species and their reactions in natural waters and wastewaters.
3.6 GASES IN WATER
Dissolved gases—O2 for fi  sh and CO2 for photosynthetic algae—are crucial to the welfare of living 
species in water. Some gases in water can also cause problems, such as the death of fi  sh from 
b  u b b l e s  o f  n i t r o g e n  f o r m e d  i n  t h e  b l o o d  c a u s e d  b y  e x p o s u r e  t o  w a t e r  s u p e r s a t u r a t e d  w i t h  N2. 
Volcanic carbon dioxide evolved from supersaturated dissolved CO2 in the waters of Lake Nyos in 
the African country of Cameroon asphyxiated 1700 people in 1986.
The solubilities of gases in water are calculated with  Henry’s law , which states that the solubility 
of a gas in a liquid is proportional to the partial pressure of that gas in contact with the liquid. 
These calculations are discussed in some detail in Chapter 5.

direct toxicity of pollutants but from a defi  ciency of oxygen because of its consumption in the bio-
degradation of pollutants.
Most elemental oxygen comes from the atmosphere, which is 20.95% oxygen by volume of dry 
air. Therefore, the ability of a body of water to re-oxygenate itself by contact with the atmosphere is 
an  im p o rtan t  c h ar a c t e ri s ti c .  O x y g e n  i s  p r o d u c e d  b y  th e  p h o t o s y n th e ti c  a c ti o n  o f  al g a e ,  b u t  thi s  
 process is really not an effi  cient means of oxygenating water because some of the oxygen formed 
by photosynthesis during the daylight hours is lost at night when the algae consume oxygen as part 
of their metabolic processes. When the algae die, the degradation of their biomass also consumes 
oxygen.
The solubility of oxygen in water depends upon water temperature, the partial pressure of oxygen 
in the atmosphere, and the salt content of the water. It is important to distinguish between oxygen 
solubility , the maximum dissolved O2 concentration at equilibrium, and DO concentration , which 
is generally not the equilibrium concentration and is limited by the rate at which oxygen dissolves. 
The calculation of oxygen solubility as a function of partial pressure is discussed in Section 5.3, 
where it is shown that the concentration of oxygen in water at 25°C in equilibrium with air at atmo-
spheric pressure is only 8.32 mg/L. Thus, water in equilibrium with air cannot contain a high level 
of DO compared with many other solute species. If oxygen-consuming processes are occurring in 
the water, the DO level may rapidly approach zero unless some effi  cient mechanism for the reaera-
tion of water is operative, such as turbulent fl  ow in a shallow stream or air pumped into the aeration 
tank of an activated sludge secondary waste treatment facility (see Chapter 8). The problem becomes 
largely one of kinetics, in which there is a limit to the rate at which oxygen is transferred across the 
air–water interface. This rate depends upon turbulence, air bubble size, temperature, and other 
factors.
If organic matter of biological origin is represented by the formula {CH2O}, the consumption of 
oxygen in water by the degradation of organic matter may be expressed by the following biochemi-
cal reaction:
 {CH2O} + O2 Æ CO2 + H2O (3.1)
The mass of organic material required to consume the 8.3 mg of O2 in a liter of water in equilibrium 
with the atmosphere at 25°C is given by a simple stoichiometric calculation based on Equation 3.1, 
which yields a value of 7.8 mg of {CH2O}. Thus, the microorganism-mediated degradation of only 
7 or 8 mg of organic material can completely consume the O2 in 1 L of water initially saturated with 
air at 25°C. The depletion of oxygen to levels below those that sustain oxic organisms requires the 
degradation of even less organic matter at higher temperatures ( where the solubility of oxygen is 
less) or in water not initially saturated with atmospheric oxygen. Furthermore, there are no common 
aquatic chemical reactions that replenish DO; except for oxygen provided by photosynthesis, it must 
come from the atmosphere.
The temperature effect on the solubility of gases in water is especially important in the case of 
oxygen. The solubility of oxygen in water in equilibrium with atmospheric air decreases from 
14.74 mg/L at 0°C to 7.03 mg/L at 35°C. At higher temperatures, the decreased solubility of oxygen, 
combined with the increased respiration rate of aquatic organisms, frequently causes a condition in 
which a higher demand for oxygen accompanied by lower solubility of the gas in water results in 
severe oxygen depletion.
3.7 WATER ACIDITY AND CARBON DIOXIDE IN WATER
Acid–base  phenomena in water involve loss and acceptance of H+ ion. Many species act as acids in 
water by releasing H+ ion, while others act as bases by accepting H+, and the water molecule itself 
does both. An important species in the acid–base chemistry of water is bicarbonate ion, HCO3-, 56 Environmental Chemistry
which may act as either an acid or a base:
 -- ++ /arrowpairrightleft2
33 HCO CO H  (3.2)
 -+++ /arrowpairrightleft32 2 HCO H CO ( ) H O aq  (3.3)
Acidity  as applied to natural water and wastewater is the capacity of the water to neutralize OH-; 
it is analogous to alkalinity, the capacity to neutralize H+, which is discussed in the next section. 
Although virtually all water has some alkalinity, acidic water is not frequently encountered, except 
in cases of severe pollution. Acidity generally results from the presence of weak acids, particularly 
CO2, but sometimes includes others such as H2PO4-, H2S, proteins, and fatty acids. Acidic metal 
ions, particularly Fe3+, may also contribute to acidity.
Strong acids are the most important contributors to water pollutant acidity. The term free mineral 
acid is applied to strong acids such as H2SO4 and HCl in water. Acid mine water is a common water 
pollutant that contains an appreciable concentration of free mineral acid. Whereas total acidity is 
determined by titration with base to the phenolphthalein end point (pH 8.2), free mineral acid is 
determined by titration with base to the methyl orange end point (pH 4.3).
As shown by the hydrolysis of hydrated Al3+ below, the acidic character of some hydrated metal 
ions may contribute to acidity. Some industrial wastes, such as spent steel pickling liquor, contain 
acidic metal ions and often some excess strong acid. The acidity of such wastes must be measured 
in calculating the amount of lime or other chemicals required to neutralize the acid.

3.7.1 C ARBON  DIOXIDE  IN WATER
The most important weak acid in water is carbon dioxide, CO2. Because of the presence of carbon 
dioxide in air and its production from microbial decay of organic matter, dissolved CO2 is present 
in virtually all natural waters and wastewaters. Rainfall from even an absolutely unpolluted atmo-
sphere is slightly acidic due to the presence of dissolved CO2. Dissolution in seawater is an impor-
tant mechanism for the reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide, the “greenhouse” gas that makes 
the greatest contribution to climate warming. Proposals have been made to pump CO2 from com-
bustion into places in the ocean where seawater is sinking to sequester it from the atmosphere for 
thousands of years.2
Carbon dioxide, and its ionization products, bicarbonate ion (HCO3-), and carbonate ion (CO32-), 
have an extremely important infl  uence upon the chemistry of water. Many minerals are deposited 
as salts of the carbonate ion. Algae in water utilize dissolved CO2 in the synthesis of biomass. The 
equilibrium of dissolved CO2 with gaseous carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,
 /arrowpairrightleft22CO (water) CO (atmosphere) (3.5)
and the equilibrium of CO32- ion between aquatic solution and solid carbonate minerals,
 22
33 MCO (slightly soluble carbonate salt) M CO+-+ /arrowpairrightleft (3.6)
have a strong buffering effect upon the pH of water.
Carbon dioxide is only about 0.039% by volume of normal dry air. As a consequence of the low 
level of atmospheric CO2, water totally lacking in alkalinity (capacity to neutralize H+, see Section 
3.8) in equilibrium with the atmosphere contains only a very low level of carbon dioxide. However, 
the formation of HCO3- and CO32- greatly increases the solubility of carbon dioxide. High concentra-
tions of free carbon dioxide in water may adversely affect respiration and gas exchange of aquatic 
animals. It may even cause death and should not exceed levels of 25 mg/L in water.Fundamentals of Aquatic Chemistry 57
A large share of the carbon dioxide found in water is a product of the breakdown of organic matter 
by bacteria. Even algae, which utilize CO2 in photosynthesis, produce it through their metabolic 
processes in the absence of light. As water seeps through layers of decaying organic matter while 
infi ltrating the ground, it may dissolve a great deal of CO2 produced by the respiration of organisms 
in the soil. Later, as water goes through limestone formations, it dissolves calcium carbonate because 
of the presence of the dissolved CO2:
 +-++ + /arrowpairrightleft2
322 3 CaCO ( ) CO ( ) H O Ca 2HCO sa q  (3.7)
This process is the one by which limestone caves are formed. The implications of the above reaction 
for aquatic chemistry are discussed in greater detail in Section 3.9.
The concentration of gaseous CO2 in the atmosphere varies with location and season; it is increas-
ing by about one part per million (ppm) by volume per year. For purposes of calculation here, the 
concentration of atmospheric CO2 will be taken as 390 ppm (0.0390%) in dry air. At 25°C, water in 
equilibrium with unpolluted air containing 390 ppm carbon dioxide has a CO2(aq) concentration of 
1.276 ¥ 10-5 M (see Henry’s law calculation of gas solubility in Section 5.3), and this value will be 
used for subsequent calculations. 
Although CO2 in water is often represented as H2CO3, the equilibrium constant for the reaction
 + /arrowpairrightleft222 3CO ( ) H O H CO aq  (3.8)
is only around 2 ¥ 10-3 at 25°C, so just a small fraction of the dissolved carbon dioxide is actually 
present as H2CO3. In this text, nonionized carbon dioxide in water will be designated simply as 
CO2, which in subsequent discussions will stand for the total of dissolved molecular CO2 and 
undissociated H2CO3.
The CO2-HCO3--CO32- system in water may be described by the equations,

This is best shown by a distribution of species diagram with pH as a master variable as illustrated in 
Figure 3.8. Such a diagram shows the major species present in solution as a function of pH. For CO2 
in aqueous solution, the diagram is a series of plots of the fractions present as CO2, HCO3-, and CO32-

The distribution of species diagram in Figure 3.8 shows that hydrogen carbonate (bicarbonate) ion

390 ppm CO2 is 1.276 ¥ 10-5 M. The carbon dioxide dissociates partially in water to produce equal

This calculation explains why pure water that has equilibrated with the unpolluted atmosphere is 
slightly acidic with a pH somewhat below 7.
3.8 ALKALINITY
The capacity of water to accept H+ ions (protons) is called  alkalinity . Alkalinity is important in 
water treatment and in the chemistry and biology of natural waters. Frequently, the alkalinity of 
water must be known to calculate the quantities of chemicals to be added in treating the water. 
Highly alkaline water often has a high pH and generally contains elevated levels of dissolved solids. 
These characteristics may be detrimental for water to be used in boilers, food processing, and 
municipal water systems. Alkalinity serves as a pH buffer and reservoir for inorganic carbon, thus 
helping us to determine the ability of a water to support algal growth and other aquatic life, so it can 
be used as a measure of water fertility. Generally, the basic species responsible for alkalinity in 
water are bicarbonate ion, carbonate ion, and hydroxide ion:
 -+++ /arrowpairrightleft32 2 HCO H CO H O  (3.21)
 -+ -+ /arrowpairrightleft2
33CO H HCO  (3.22)
 -++ /arrowpairrightleft2 OH H H O  (3.23)
Other, usually minor, contributors to alkalinity are ammonia and the conjugate bases of phosphoric, 
silicic, boric, and organic acids.
At pH values below 7 , [H+] in water detracts signifi  cantly from alkalinity, and its concentration 
must be subtracted in computing the total alkalinity. Therefore, the following equation is the complete 
equation for alkalinity in a medium where the only contributors to it are HCO3-, CO32-, and OH-:
 [alk] = [HCO3-] + 2[CO32-] + [OH-] - [H+] (3.24)
Alkalinity generally is expressed as phenolphthalein alkalinity , corresponding to titration with 
acid to the pH at which HCO3- is the predominant carbonate species (pH 8.3), or total alkalinity , 
corresponding to titration with acid to the methyl orange end point (pH 4.3), where both bicarbonate 
and carbonate species have been converted to CO2.
It is important to distinguish between high basicity , manifested by an elevated pH, and high 
alkalinity , the capacity to accept H+. Whereas pH is an intensity  factor, alkalinity is a capacity 
f actor. This may be illustrated by comparing a solution of 1.00 ¥ 10-3 M NaOH with a solution of 
0.100 M NaHCO3. The sodium hydroxide solution is very basic, pH 11, but a liter of it will neutralize 
only 1.00 ¥ 10-3 mol of acid. The pH of the NaHCO3 solution is 8.34, much lower than that of the 
NaOH. However, a liter of the sodium bicarbonate solution will neutralize 0.100 mol of acid; there-
fore, its alkalinity is 100 times that of the more basic NaOH solution.
In engineering terms, alkalinity frequently is expressed in units of mg/L of CaCO3, based upon 
the following acid-neutralizing reaction:
 +++ + /arrowpairrightleft2+
32 2 CaCO 2H Ca CO H O  (3.25)60 Environmental Chemistry
The equivalent mass of calcium carbonate is one-half its formula mass. Expressing alkalinity in 
terms of mg/L of CaCO3 can, however, lead to confusion, and the preferable notation for the chemist 
is equivalents/L (eq/L), the number of moles of H+ neutralized by the alkalinity in a liter of 
solution.
3.8.1 C ONTRIBUTORS  TO ALKALINITY  AT DIFFERENT  PH V ALUES
Natural water typically has an alkalinity (“[alk]”) of 1.00 ¥ 10-3 eq/L, meaning that the alkaline 
solutes in 1 L of the water will neutralize 1.00 ¥ 10-3 mol of acid. The contributions made by differ-
ent species to alkalinity depend upon pH. This is shown here by calculation of the relative contribu-
tions to alkalinity of HCO3-, CO32-, and OH- at pH 7.0 and 10.0. First, for water at pH 7.0, [OH-] is 
too low to make any signifi  cant contribution to the alkalinity. Furthermore, as shown by Figure 3.8, 
at pH 7.0, [HCO3-] /H11271 [CO32-]. Therefore, the alkalinity is due to HCO3- and [HCO3-] = 1.00 ¥ 10-3 M. 
Substitution into the expression for Ka1 shows that at pH 7.0 and [HCO3-] = 1.00 ¥ 10-3 M, the value 
of [CO2 (aq)] is 2.25 ¥ 10-4 M, higher than the value that arises from water in equilibrium with 
atmospheric air, but readily reached due to the presence of carbon dioxide from bacterial decay in 
water and sediments.
Consider next the case of water with the same alkalinity, 1.00 ¥ 10-3 eq/L but with a pH of 10.0. 
At this higher pH both OH- and CO32- are present at signifi  cant concentrations compared with HCO3- 
and the following may be calculated:
 [alk] = [HCO3-] + 2[CO32-] + [OH-] = 1.00 ¥ 10-3 (3.26)
The concentration of CO32- is multiplied by 2 because each CO32- ion can neutralize two H+ ions. The 
other two equations that must be solved to get the concentrations of HCO3, CO32-, and OH- are

3.8.2 D ISSOLVED  INORGANIC  CARBON  AND ALKALINITY
The values given above can be used to show that at the same alkalinity value the concentration of 
total dissolved inorganic carbon, [C],
 [C] = [CO2] + [HCO3-] + [CO32-] (3.29)Fundamentals of Aquatic Chemistry 61
varies with pH. At pH 7.0,
 [C]pH 7 = 2.25 ¥ 10-4 + 1.00 ¥ 10-3 + 0 = 1.22 ¥ 10-3 (3.30)
whereas at pH 10.0,
 [C]pH 10 = 0 + 4.64 ¥ 10-4 + 2.18 ¥ 10-4 = 6.82 ¥ 10-4 (3.31)
The calculation above shows that the dissolved inorganic carbon concentration at pH 10.0 is only 
about half that at pH 7.0. This is because at pH 10.0 major contributions to alkalinity are made by 
CO32- ion, each of which has twice the alkalinity of each HCO3- ion, and by OH-, which does not 
contain any carbon. The lower inorganic carbon concentration at pH 10.0 shows that an initially 
relatively low pH aquatic system (pH 7.0) can donate dissolved inorganic carbon for use in photo-
synthesis with a change in pH but none in alkalinity . This pH-dependent difference in dissolved 
inorganic carbon concentration represents a signifi  cant potential source of carbon for algae growing 
in water, which fi  x carbon by the overall reactions

and

As dissolv ed inorganic carbon is used up to synthesize biomass, { CH2O}, the water becomes 
more basic. The amount of inorganic carbon that can be consumed before the water becomes too 
basic to allow algal reproduction is proportional to the alkalinity. In going from pH 7.0 to pH 10.0, 
the amount of inorganic carbon consumed from 1.00 L of water having an alkalinity of 
1.00 ¥ 10-3 eq/L is 
 [C]pH 7 ¥ 1 L - [C]pH 10 ¥ 1 L = 1.22 ¥ 10-3 mol - 6.82 ¥ 10-4 mol = 5.4 ¥ 10-4 mol (3.34)
This translates to an increase of 5.4 ¥ 10-4 mol/L of biomass. Since the formula mass of {CH2O} 
is 30, the weight of biomass produced amounts to 16 mg/L. Assuming no input of additional CO2, 
at higher alkalinity more biomass is produced for the same change in pH, whereas at lower alka-
linity less is produced. Because of this effect, biologists use alkalinity as a measure of water 
fertility.
3.8.3 I NFLUENCE  OF ALKALINITY  ON CO2 SOLUBILITY
The increased solubility of carbon dioxide in water with an elevated alkalinity can be illustrated by 
comparing its solubility in pure water (alkalinity 0) to its solubility in water initially containing 
1.00 ¥ 10-3 M NaOH (alkalinity 1.00 ¥ 10-3 eq/L). The number of moles of CO2 that will dissolve in 
a liter of pure water from the atmosphere containing 390 ppm carbon dioxide is
 Solubility = [CO2 (aq)] + [HCO3-] (3.35)
Substituting values calculated in Section 3.7 gives
 Solubility = 1.276 ¥ 10-5 + 2.38 ¥ 10-6 = 1.514 ¥ 10-5 M62 Environmental Chemistry
The solubility of CO2 in water, initially 1.00 ¥ 10-3 M in NaOH, is about 100-fold higher because of 
uptake of CO2 by the reaction
 CO2 (aq) + OH- Æ HCO3- (3.36)
so that
 Solubility = [CO2 (aq)] + [HCO3-] = 1.276 ¥ 10-5 + 1.00 ¥ 10-3 = 1.01 ¥ 10-3 M (3.37)
3.9 CALCIUM AND OTHER METALS IN WATER
The kinds and concentrations of metal ions in water are determined largely by the rocks that the 
water contacts. Metal ions in water, commonly denoted Mn+, exist in numerous forms. A bare metal 
ion, Ca2+ for example, cannot exist as a separate entity in water. In order to secure the highest stabil-
ity of their outer electron shells, metal ions in water are bonded, or coordinated , to other species. 
These may be water molecules or other stronger bases (electron-donor partners) that might be 
pr esent. Therefore, metal ions in water solution are present in forms such as the hydrated  metal 
cation M(H2O)xn+. Metal ions in aqueous solution seek to reach a state of maximum stability through 
chemical reactions including acid–base,

and oxidation–reduction reactions:
 +- +++ + /arrowpairrightleft2
26 3 2 Fe(H O) Fe(OH) ( ) 3H O 3H se  (3.40)
These all provide a means through which metal ions in water are transformed to more stable forms. 
Because of reactions such as these and the formation of dimeric species, such as Fe2(OH)24+, the 
concentration of simple hydrated Fe(H2O)63+ ions in water is vanishingly small; the same holds true 
for many other hydrated metal ions dissolved in water.
3.9.1 H YDRATED  METAL IONS AS ACIDS
Hydrated metal ions, particularly those with a charge of +3 or more, tend to lose H+ ions from the 
water molecules bound to them in aqueous solution, and fi  t the defi  nition of Brönsted acids, accord-
ing to which acids are H+ donors and bases are H+ acceptors. The acidity of a metal ion increases 
with charge and decreases with increasing radius. As shown by the reaction,
 ++ ++ /arrowpairrightleft32
26 25 Fe(H O) Fe(H O) OH H  (3.41)
hydrated iron(III) ion is an acid, a relatively strong one with a Ka1 of 8.9 ¥ 10-4, so that solutions of 
iron(III) tend to have low pH values. Hydrated trivalent metal ions, such as iron(III), generally are 
minus at least one hydrogen ion at neutral pH values or above. For tetravalent metal ions, the com-
pletely protonated forms, M(H2O)x4+, are rare even at very low pH values. Commonly, O2- is coordi-
nated to tetravalent metal ions; an example is the vanadium(IV) species, VO2+. Generally, divalent 
metal ions do not lose a hydrogen ion at pH values below 6, whereas monovalent metal ions such as 
Na+ do not act as acids at all, and exist in water solution as simple hydrated ions.Fundamentals of Aquatic Chemistry 63
The tendency of hydrated metal ions to behave as acids may have a profound effect upon the 
aquatic environment. A good example is acid mine water  (see Chapter 7), which derives part of its 
acidic character from the acidic nature of hydrated iron(III):
 ++++ /arrowpairrightleft3
26 3 2 Fe(H O) Fe(OH) ( ) 3H 3H O s  (3.42)
Hydroxide, OH-, bonded to a metal ion, may function as a bridging group to join two or more 
metals together as shown by the following dehydration–dimerization process:
 → 2Fe(H2O)5OH2+Fe(H2O)44+ + 2(H2O)H
HO
O(H2O)5Fe  (3.43)
Among the metals other than iron(III) forming polymeric species with OH- as a bridging group are 
Al(III), Be(II), Bi(III), Ce(IV), Co(III), Cu(II), Ga(III), Mo(V), Pb(II), Sc(II), Sn(IV), and U(VI). 
Additional hydrogen ions may be lost from water molecules bonded to the dimers, furnishing OH- 
groups for further bonding and leading to the formation of polymeric hydrolytic species. If the 
process continues, colloidal hydroxy polymers are formed and, fi  nally, precipitates are produced. 
This process is thought to be the general one by which hydrated iron(III) oxide, Fe2 O3 · x(H2O) [also 
called iron(II) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3], is precipitated from solutions containing iron(III).
3.9.2 C ALCIUM  IN WATER
Of the cations found in most freshwater systems, calcium generally has the highest concentration. 
The chemistry of calcium, although complicated enough, is simpler than that of the transition metal 
ions found in water. Calcium is a key element in many geochemical processes, and minerals consti-
tute the primary sources of calcium ion in waters. Among the primary contributing minerals are 
gypsum, CaSO4 · 2H2O; anhydrite, CaSO4; dolomite, CaMg(CO3)2; and calcite and aragonite, which 
are different mineral forms of CaCO3.
Calcium ion, along with magnesium and sometimes iron(II) ion, accounts for water hardness . 
The most common manifestation of water hardness is the curdy precipitate formed by soap in hard 
water. Temporary hardness  is due to the presence of calcium and bicarbonate ions in water and may 
be eliminated by boiling the water:

Increased temperature may force this reaction to the right by evolving CO2 gas, and a white precipi-
tate of calcium carbonate may form in boiling water having temporary hardness.
Water containing a high level of carbon dioxide readily dissolves calcium from its carbonate 
minerals:

Wh e n  t h i s  r e a c t i o n  i s  r e v e r s e d  a n d  C O2 is lost from the water, calcium carbonate deposits are 
formed. The concentration of CO2 in water determines the extent of dissolution of calcium car-
bonate. The carbon dioxide that water may gain by equilibration with the atmosphere is not 
 suffi cient to account for the levels of calcium dissolved in natural waters, especially groundwaters. 64 Environmental Chemistry
Rather, the respiration of microorganisms degrading organic matter in water, sediments, and soil,

accounts f or the v ery hi gh le v e ls o f CO2 and HCO3- observed in water and is very important in 
aquatic chemical processes and geochemical transformations.
3.9.3 D ISSOLVED  CARBON  DIOXIDE  AND CALCIUM  CARBONATE  MINERALS
The equilibrium between dissolved carbon dioxide and calcium carbonate minerals is important in 
determining several natural water chemistry parameters such as alkalinity, pH, and dissolved cal-
cium concentration (Figure 3.9). For freshwater, the typical fi  gures quoted for the concentrations of 
both HCO 3- and Ca2+ are 1.00 ¥ 10-3 M. It may be shown that these are reasonable values when the 
water is in equilibrium with limestone, CaCO3, and with atmospheric CO2. The concentration of 
CO2 in water in equilibrium with air has already been calculated as 1.276 ¥ 10-5 M. The other 
c onstants needed to calculate [HCO3-] and [Ca2+] are the acid dissociation constant for CO2:

a value of 5.54 ¥ 10-9 M is obtained for [H+] (pH 8.26). The alkalinity is essentially equal to [HCO3-], 
which is much higher than [CO32-] or [OH-].
To summarize, for water in equilibrium with solid calcium carbonate and atmospheric CO2, the 
following concentrations are calculated:
 [CO2] = 1.276 ¥ 10-5 M, [Ca2+] = 5.14 ¥ 10-4 M
 [HCO3-] = 1.03 ¥ 10-3 M, [H+] = 5.54 ¥ 10-9 M
 [CO32-] = 8.70 ¥ 10-6 M,  pH = 8.26
Factors such as nonequilibrium conditions, high CO2 concentrations in bottom regions, and 
increased pH due to algal uptake of CO2 cause deviations from these values. Nevertheless, they are 
close to the values found in a large number of natural water bodies.
3.10 COMPLEXATION AND CHELATION
The properties of metals dissolved in water depend largely upon the nature of metal species dis-
s o l v e d  i n  t h e  w a t e r .  Th e r e f o r e ,  speciation of metals plays a crucial role in their environmental 
chemistry in natural waters and wastewaters. In addition to the hydrated metal ions, for example, 
Fe(H2O)63+ and hydroxy species such as FeOH(H2O)52+ discussed in the preceding section, metals 
may exist in water reversibly bound to inorganic anions or to organic compounds as  metal com-
plexes . For example, a cyanide ion can bond to dissolved iron(II):
 +- +++ /arrowpairrightleft2
26 25 2 Fe(H O) CN FeCN(H O) H O  (3.53)
Additional cyanide ions may bond to the iron to form Fe(CN)2, Fe(CN)3-, Fe(CN)42-, Fe(CN)53-, 
and Fe(CN)64-, where the water molecules still bound to the iron(II) are omitted for simplicity. This 
phenomenon is called complexation ; the species that binds with the metal ion, CN-, in the example 
abo v e , i s call ed a ligand , and the product in which the ligand is bound with the metal ion is a 
co mplex , complex ion , or coordination compound . A special case of complexation in which a ligand 
bonds in two or more places to a metal ion is called chelation . In addition to being present as metal 
complexes, metals may occur in water as organometallic compounds containing carbon-to-metal 
bonds. The solubilities, transport properties, and biological effects of such species are often vastly 
different from those of the metal ions themselves. Subsequent sections of this chapter consider 
metal species with an emphasis upon metal complexation, especially chelation, in which particu-
larly strong metal complexes are formed.
In the example above, the cyanide ion is a unidentate ligand , which means that it possesses only 
one site that bonds to a metal ion. Complexes of unidentate ligands are of relatively little importance 
in solution in natural waters. Of considerably more importance are complexes with chelating agents . 
A chelating agent has more than one atom that may be bonded to a central metal ion at one time to 66 Environmental Chemistry
form a ring structure. Thus, pyrophosphate ion, P2O74-, bonds to two sites on a calcium ion to form 
a chelate:
OPP
OO
CaO O
OO2–
In general, since a chelating agent may bond to a metal ion in more than one place simulta-
neously (Figure 3.10), chelates are more stable than complexes with unidentate ligands. Stability tends 
to increase with the number of chelating sites available on the ligand. Structures of metal chelates 
take a number of different forms, all characterized by rings in various confi  gurations. The structure 
of a tetrahedrally coordinated chelate of nitrilotriacetate (NTA) ion is shown in Figure 3.10.
The ligands found in natural waters and wastewaters contain a variety of functional groups 
which can donate the electrons required to bond the ligand to a metal ion. Among the most common 
of these groups are:
RCO–ON
CO–
RN :H
HROPO–O
O
Carboxylate Heterocyclic
nitrogenPhenoxide Aliphatic and
aromatic aminoPhosphate
These ligands complex most metal ions found in unpolluted waters and biological systems (Mg2+, 
Ca2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and VO2+). They also bind to contaminant metal ions such as 
Co2+, Ni2+, Sr2+, Cd2+, and Ba2+.
Complexation may have a number of effects, including reactions of both ligands and metals. Among 
the ligand reactions are oxidation–reduction, decarboxylation, hydrolysis, and biodegradation. 
Complexation may cause changes in oxidation state of the metal and may result in a metal becoming 
solubilized from an insoluble compound. The formation of insoluble complex compounds removes 
metal ions from solution. Complexation may strongly infl  uence metals’ adsorption, distribution, trans-
port, and fate as well as biochemical effects including bioavailability, toxicity, and plant uptake.3
Complex compounds of metals such as iron (in hemoglobin) and magnesium (in chlorophyll) are 
vital to life processes. Naturally occurring chelating agents, such as humic substances and amino 
acids, are found in water and soil. The high concentration of chloride ion in seawater results in the 
formation of some chloro complexes. Synthetic chelating agents such as sodium tripolyphosphate, 
sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), sodium NTA, and sodium citrate are produced in 
large quantities for use in metal-plating baths, industrial water treatment, detergent formulations, 
and food preparation. These compounds may enter aquatic systems through waste discharges.

3.10.1 O CCURRENCE  AND IMPORTANCE  OF CHELATING  AGENTS  IN WATER
Chelating agents are common potential water pollutants. These substances can occur in sewage 
effl uent and industrial wastewater such as metal plating wastewater. In addition to pollutant sources, 
there are natural sources of chelating agents. One such chelating agent is ethylenediaminedisuccinic 
acid,

a metabolite of the soil actinomycete, Amycolatopsis orientalis . Unlike a number of common syn-
thetic chelating agents, such as EDTA (see below), ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid is biodegradable 
and has been used as an extractant for phytoremediation (see Chapter 9, Section 21.9) of sites con-
taminated with heavy metals.
The most important pollutant chelating agents are aminopolycarboxylates, of which the most 
common examples are NTA (Figure 3.10) and EDTA (structure illustrated at the beginning of 
Section 3.13). Both EDTA and NTA are common water pollutants.4 Because of their strong bonding 
to metal ions, the aminopolycarboxylate chelating agents are almost always encountered in the 
bound form, which has a strong effect on their chemistry and environmental fate and transport. To 
the extent that EDTA is present in wastewater, it prevents some metals from binding to and settling 
out with biomass sludge in biological wastewater treatment processes. Therefore, EDTA chelates 
compose most of the copper, nickel, and zinc in wastewater effl  uents (most of these metals in excess 
of strong chelating agents present are incorporated into the sludge).
Chelation by EDTA has been shown to greatly increase the migration rates of radioactive 60Co 
from pits and trenches used by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, for 
disposal of intermediate-level radioactive waste. EDTA was used as a cleaning and solubilizing 
agent for the decontamination of hot cells, equipment, and reactor components. Analysis of water 
from sample wells in the disposal pits showed EDTA concentrations of 3.4 ¥ 10-7 M. The presence 
of EDTA 12–15 years after its burial attests to its low rate of biodegradation. In addition to cobalt, 
EDTA strongly chelates radioactive plutonium and radioisotopes of Am3+, Cm3+, and Th4+. Such 
chelates with negative charges are much less strongly sorbed by mineral matter and are vastly more 
mobile than the unchelated metal ions.
Contrary to the above fi  ndings, only very low concentrations of chelatable radioactive plutonium 
were observed in groundwater near the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant’s low-level waste disposal 
well. No plutonium was observed in wells at any signifi  cant distance from the disposal well. The 
waste processing procedure used was designed to destroy any chelating agents in the waste prior to 
disposal, and no chelating agents were found in the water pumped from the test wells.
The fate of radionuclide metal chelates that have been discarded in soil is obviously important. 
If some mechanism exists to destroy the chelating agents, the radioactive metals will be much less 
mobile. A lthough EDTA is only poorly biodegradable, N TA is degraded by the action of Chlatobacter 
heintzii  bacteria. In addition to uncomplexed NTA, these bacteria have been shown to degrade NTA 
that is chelated to metals, including cobalt, iron, zinc, aluminum, copper, and nickel.
Complexing agents in wastewater are of concern primarily because of their ability to solubi-
lize heavy metals from plumbing, and from deposits containing heavy metals. Complexation may 
increase the leaching of heavy metals from waste disposal sites and reduce the effi  ciency with 
which heavy metals are removed with sludge in conventional biological waste treatment. Removal 
of chelated iron is diffi  cult with conventional municipal water treatment processes. Iron(III) and 
perhaps several other essential micronutrient metal ions are kept in solution by chelation in algal 
cultures. The availability of chelating agents may be a factor in determining growth of algae and 68 Environmental Chemistry
plants in water.5 The yellow-brown color of some natural waters is due to naturally occurring 
chelates of iron.
3.11 BONDING AND STRUCTURE OF METAL COMPLEXES
This section discusses some of the fundamentals of complexation in water. A complex consists of a 
central metal atom to which neutral or negatively charged ligands possessing electron-donor proper-
ties are bonded. The complex may be neutral or may have a positive or negative charge. The ligands 
are contained within the coordination sphere of the central metal atom. Depending upon the type 
of bonding involved, the ligands within the coordination sphere are held in a defi  nite structural pat-
tern. However, in solution, ligands of many complexes exchange rapidly between solution and the 
coordination sphere of the central metal ion.
The coordination number of a metal atom, or ion, is the number of ligand electron-donor groups 
that are bonded to it. The most common coordination numbers are 2, 4, and 6. Polynuclear com-
plexes contain two or more metal atoms joined together through bridging ligands, frequently OH, as 
shown for iron(III) in Reaction 3.43.
3.11.1 S ELECTIVITY  AND SPECIFICITY  IN CHELATION
Although chelating agents are never entirely specifi  c for a particular metal ion, some complicated 
chelating agents of biological origin approach almost complete specifi  city for certain metal ions. 
One example of such a chelating agent is ferrichrome, synthesized by and extracted from fungi, 
which forms extremely stable chelates with iron(III). It has been observed that cyanobacteria of the 
Anabaena species secrete appreciable quantities of iron-selective hydroxamate chelating agents 
during periods of heavy algal bloom. These photosynthetic organisms readily take up iron chelated 
by hydroxamate-chelated iron, whereas some competing green algae, such as Scenedesmus , do not. 
Thus, the chelating agent serves a dual function of promoting the growth of certain cyanobacteria 
while suppressing the growth of competing species, allowing the cyanobacteria to exist as the pre-
dominant species. The production of chelating agents selective for iron(III) has been observed in 
cyanobacterial Plectonema  and Spirulina  as well as Chlorella , Scenedesmus , and Porphyrium  
algae.
3.12 CALCULATIONS OF SPECIES CONCENTRATIONS
The stability of complex ions in solution is expressed in terms of formation constants . These can be 
stepwise formation constants (K expressions) representing the bonding of individual ligands to a 
metal ion, or overall formation constants (b expressions) representing the binding of two or more 
ligands to a metal ion. These concepts are illustrated for complexes of zinc ion with ammonia by the 
following:

The following sections show some calculations involving chelated metal ions in aquatic systems. 
Because of their complexity, the details of these calculations may be beyond the needs of some 
 readers, who may choose to simply consider the results. In addition to the complexation itself, con-
sideration must be given to competition of H+ for ligands, competition among metal ions for ligands, 
competition among different ligands for metal ions, and precipitation of metal ions by various 
 precipitants. Not the least of the problems involved in such calculations is the lack of accurately 
known values of equilibrium constants to be used under the conditions being considered, a factor 
that can yield questionable results from even the most elegant computerized calculations. 
Furthermore, kinetic factors are often quite important. Such calculations, however, can be quite 
useful to provide an overall view of aquatic systems in which complexation is important, and as 
general guidelines to determine areas in which more data should be obtained.
3.13 COMPLEXATION BY DEPROTONATED LIGANDS
Generally, calculation of complex species concentrations is complicated by competition between 
metal ions and H+ for ligands. First consider an example in which the ligand has lost all ionizable 
hydrogen. At pH values of 11 or above, EDTA is essentially all in the completely ionized tetranega-
tive form, Y4-, illustrated below:

Consider a wastewater with an alkaline pH of 11 containing copper(II) at a total level of 5.0 mg/L 
and excess uncomplexed EDTA at a level of 200 mg/L (expressed as the disodium salt, 
Na2H2C10H12O8N2 · 2H2O, formula mass 372). At this pH, uncomplexed EDTA is present as ionized 
Y4-. The questions to be asked are: Will most of the copper be present as the EDTA complex? If so, 
what will be the equilibrium concentration of the hydrated copper(II) ion, Cu2+? To answer the 
f  ormer questi on i t is fi  rst necessary to calculate the molar concentration of uncomplexed excess 
EDTA, Y4-. Since disodium EDTA with a formula mass of 372 is present at 200 mg/L (ppm), the 
total molar concentration of EDTA as Y4- is 5.4 ¥ 10-4 M. The formation constant K1 of the 
copper–EDTA complex CuY2- is

and, therefore, essentially all of the copper is present as the complex ion. The molar concentration 
of total copper(II) in a solution containing 5.0 mg/L copper(II) is 7.9 ¥ 10-5 M, which in this case is 
essentially all in the form of the EDTA complex. The very low concentration of uncomplexed,

In the medium described, the concentration of hydrated Cu2+ ion is extremely low compared to 
total copper(II). Solution phenomena that depend upon the concentration of the hydrated Cu2+ ion 
(such as a physiological effect or an electrode response) would differ greatly in the medium described, 
compared to the effect observed if all of the copper at a level of 5.0 mg/L were present as Cu2+ in a 
more aci di c so l u ti on and in the absence o f comp l e xin g ag en t. The phenomenon o f reducin g the 
concentration of hydrated metal ion to very low values through the action of strong chelating agents 
is one of the most important effects of complexation in natural aquatic systems.
3.14 COMPLEXATION BY PROTONATED LIGANDS
Generally, complexing agents, particularly chelating compounds, are conjugate bases of Brönsted 
acids; for example, glycinate anion, H2NCH2CO2-, is the conjugate base of glycine, +H3NCH2CO2-. 
Therefore, in many cases hydrogen ion competes with metal ions for a ligand, so that the strength of 
chelation depends upon pH. In the nearly neutral pH range usually encountered in natural waters, 
most organic ligands are present in a conjugated acid form.
In order to understand the competition between hydrogen ion and metal ion for a ligand, it is 
u seful to know the distribution of ligand species as a function of pH. Consider nitrilotriacetic acid 
(NTA), commonly designated H3T, as an example. The trisodium salt of this compound is a strong 
chelating agent that can be used in metal plating, as a detergent phosphate substitute, and in other 
applications in which strong chelating capability is required. Biological processes are required for 
NTA degradation, and under some conditions it persists for long times in water. Given the ability of 
NTA to solubilize and transport heavy metal ions, this material is of potential environmental 
concern. 
Nitrilotriacetic acid, H3T, loses hydrogen ion in three steps to form the NTA anion, T3-, the struc-
tural formula of which is

NTA may exist in solution as any one of the four species, H3T, H2T-, HT2-, or T3-, depending 
upon the pH of the solution. As was shown for the CO2/HCO3-/CO32- system in Section 3.7 and 
Figure 3.8, fractions of NTA species can be illustrated graphically by a diagram of the distribution-
of-species with pH as a master (independent) variable. The key points used to plot such a diagram 
for NTA are given in Table 3.2, and the plot of fractions of species ( a values) as a function of pH is 
shown in Figure 3.11. Examination of the plot shows that the complexing anion T3- is the predomi-
nant species only at relatively high pH values, much higher than would be usually encountered in 
natural waters. The HT2- species has an extremely wide range of predominance, however, spanning 
the entire normal pH range of ordinary freshwaters.
3.15 SOLUBILIZATION OF LEAD ION FROM SOLIDS BY NTA
A major concern regarding the widespread introduction of strong chelating agents such as NTA into 
aquatic ecosystems from sources such as detergents or electroplating wastes is that of possible solu-
bilization of toxic heavy metals from solids through the action of chelating agents. Experimentation 
is required to determine whether this may be a problem, but calculations are helpful in predicting 
probable effects. The extent of solubilization of heavy metals depends upon a number of factors, 
including the stability of the metal chelates, the concentration of the complexing agent in the water, 
pH, and the nature of the insoluble metal deposit. Several example calculations are given here.
Consider fi  rst the solubilization of lead from solid Pb(OH)2 by NTA at pH 8.0. As illustrated in 
Figure 3.11, essentially all uncomplexed NTA is present as HT2- i o n  a t  p H  8 . 0 .  T h e r e f o r e ,  t h e

Assume that a sample of water contains 25 mg/L of N( CH2CO2Na)3, the trisodium NTA salt, 
with a formula mass of 257. The total concentration of both complexed and uncomplexed NTAs is 
9.7 ¥ 10-5 mmol/mL. Assuming a system in which NTA at pH 8.0 is in equilibrium with solid 
Pb(OH)2, the NTA may be primarily in the uncomplexed form, HT2-, or in the lead complex, PbT-. 
The predominant species may be determined by calculating the [PbT-]/[HT2-] ratio from the expres-
sion for K, noting that at pH 8.0, [OH-] = 1.00 ¥ 10-6 M.

Since [PbT-]/[HT2-] is approximately from 20 to 1, most of the NTA in solution is present as the 
lead chelate. The molar concentration of PbT- is just slightly less than the 9.7 ¥ 10-5 mmol/mL total 
NTA present. The atomic mass of lead is 207 , so the concentration of lead in solution is approxi-
mately 20 mg/L. This reaction is pH dependent such that the fraction of NTA chelated decreases 
with increasing pH.
3.15.1 R EACTION  OF NTA WITH METAL CARBONATE
Carbonates are common forms of heavy metal ion solids. Solid lead carbonate, PbCO3, is stable 
within the pH region and alkalinity conditions often found in natural waters and wastewaters. An 
example similar to the one in the preceding section may be worked, assuming that equilibrium is 
established with PbCO3 rather than with solid Pb(OH)2. In this example it is assumed that 25 mg/L 
of trisodium NTA is in equilibrium with PbCO3 at pH 7.0 and a calculation is made to determine 
whether the lead will be complexed appreciably by the NTA. The carbonate ion, CO32-, reacts with 
H+ to form HCO3-. As discussed in Section 3.7, the acid–base equilibrium reactions for the CO2/
HCO3-/CO32- system are

where the acid dissociation constants of the carbonate species are designated with “ ¢ ” to distin-
guish them from the acid dissociation constants of NTA. Figure 3.8 shows that within a pH range of 
about 7–10 the predominant carbonic species is HCO3-; therefore, the CO32- released by the reaction 
of NTA with PbCO3 will go into solution as HCO3-:

From the expression for K, Equation 3.83, it may be seen that the degree to which PbCO3 is solu-
bilized as PbT- depends upon the concentration of HCO3-. Although this concentration will vary 
appreciably, the fi  gure commonly used to describe natural waters is a bicarbonate ion concentration 
of 1.00 ¥ 10-3, as shown in Section 3.9. Using this value the following may be calculated:

Thus, under the given conditions, most of the NTA in equilibrium with solid PbCO3 would be 
present as the lead complex. As in the previous example, at a trisodium NTA level of 25 mg/L, the 
concentration of soluble lead(II) would be approximately 20 mg/L. At relatively higher concentra-
tions of HCO3-, the tendency to solubilize lead would be diminished, whereas at lower concentra-
tions of HCO3-, NTA would be more effective in solubilizing lead.
3.15.2  EFFECT OF CALCIUM  ION UPON THE REACTION  OF CHELATING  AGENTS  
WITH SLIGHTLY  SOLUBLE  SALTS
Chelatable calcium ion, Ca2+, which is generally present in natural waters and wastewaters, com-
petes for the chelating agent with a metal in a slightly soluble salt, such as PbCO3. At pH 7.0, the 
reaction between calcium ion and NTA is

The value of K¢ is the product of the formation constant of CaT-, (1.48 ¥ 108), and Ka3 of NTA, 
5.25 ¥ 10-11. The fraction of NTA bound as CaT- depends upon the concentration of Ca2+ and the 
pH. Typically, [Ca2+] in water is 1.00 ¥ 10-3 M. Assuming this value and pH 7.0, the ratio of NTA 
present in solution as the calcium complex to that present as HT2- is

Having obtained the value of K¢¢, it is now possible to determine the distribution of NTA between 
PbT- and CaT-. Thus, for water containing NTA chelated to calcium at pH 7.0, a concentration of 
HCO3- of 1.00 ¥ 10-3, a concentration of Ca2+ of 1.00 ¥ 10-3, and in equilibrium with solid PbCO3, 
the distribution of NTA between the lead complex and the calcium complex is

It may be seen that only about one-third of the NTA would be present as the lead chelate, whereas 
under the identical conditions, but in the absence of Ca2+, approximately all of the NTA in equilib-
rium with solid PbCO3 was chelated to NTA. Since the fraction of NTA present as the lead chelate 
is directly proportional to the solubilization of PbCO3, differences in calcium concentration will 
affect the degree to which NTA solubilizes lead from lead carbonate.
3.16 POLYPHOSPHATES AND PHOSPHONATES IN WATER
Phosphorus occurs as many oxoanions, anionic forms in combination with oxygen. Some of these are 
strong complexing agents. Since about 1930, salts of polymeric phosphorus oxoanions have been used 
for water treatment, for water softening, and as detergent builders. When used for water treatment, 
polyphosphates “sequester” calcium ion in a soluble or suspended form. The effect is to reduce the 
equilibrium concentration of calcium ion and prevent the precipitation of calcium carbonate in instal-
lations such as water pipes and boilers. Furthermore, when water is softened properly with polyphos-
phates, calcium does not form precipitates with soaps or interact detrimentally with detergents.
The simplest form of phosphate is orthophosphate, PO43-:
PO
OOO3–
Orthophosphate ion has three sites for attachment of H+. Orthophosphoric acid, H3PO4, has a p Ka1 
of 2.17, a p Ka2 of 7.31, and a p Ka3 of 12.36. Because the third hydrogen ion is so diffi  cult to remove 76 Environmental Chemistry
from orthophosphate, as evidenced by the very high value of p Ka3, very basic conditions are required 
for PO43- to be present at signifi  cant levels in water. It is possible for orthophosphate in natural waters 
to originate from the hydrolysis of polymeric phosphate species.
3.16.1 P OLYPHOSPHATES
Pyrophosphate ion, P2O74-, is the fi  rst of a series of unbranched chain polyphosphates produced by 
the condensation of orthophosphate:
 -- -++ /arrowpairrightleft34
42 2 72PO H O P O 2OH  (3.91)
A long series of linear polyphosphates may be formed, the second of which is triphosphate ion, 
P3O105-. These species consist of PO4 tetrahedra with adjacent tetrahedra sharing a common oxygen 
atom at one corner. The structural formulas of the acidic forms, H4P2O7 and H5P3O10, are given in 
Figure 3.12.
It is easy to visualize the longer chains composing the higher linear polyphosphates. Vitreous 
sodium phosphates are mixtures consisting of linear phosphate chains with from 4 to approximately 
18 phosphorus atoms each. Those with intermediate chain lengths comprise the majority of the 
 species present.
3.16.2 H YDROLYSIS  OF POLYPHOSPHATES
All of the polymeric phosphates hydrolyze to simpler products in water. The rate of hydrolysis 
depends upon a number of factors, including pH, and the ultimate product is always some form of 
orthophosphate. The simplest hydrolytic reaction of  a polyphosphate is that of pyrophosphoric acid 
to produce orthophosphoric acid:
 + /arrowpairrightleft42 7 2 3 4HP O HO 2 HP O  (3.92)
Researchers have found evidence that algae and other microorganisms catalyze the hydrolysis of 
polyphosphates. Even in the absence of biological activity, polyphosphates hydrolyze chemically at a 
signifi  cant rate in water. Therefore, there is much le ss concern about the possibility of polyphosphates 
binding to heavy metal ions and transporting them than is the case with organic chelating agents such 
as NTA or EDTA, which must depend upon microbial degradation for their decomposition.
3.16.3 C OMPLEXATION  BY POLYPHOSPHATES

metal ions. Ring phosphates form much weaker complexes than do chain species. The different

acid, p Ka1 and p Ka2 values are low, p Ka3 is 2.30, p Ka4 is 6.50, and p Ka5 is 9.24. These values refl  ect the rela-
tive ease of removing H+ from OH groups on P atoms that have no other O- groups compared with those that 
already have one O- group. Fundamentals of Aquatic Chemistry 77
chelating abilities of chain and ring phosphates are due to structural hindrance of bonding by the 
ring polyphosphates.
3.16.4 P HOSPHONATES
Phosphonate chelating agents are organic compounds structurally analogous to the aminopolycar-
boxylate chelating agents such as NTA and EDTA discussed earlier in this chapter. The structural 
formula of the undissociated acid form of a typical phosphonate chelating agent, nitrilotris(methyl-
enephosphonic) acid, NTMP, is the following:

Note the similarity of the structural formula of this compound to NTA discussed earlier in this

The uses of phosphonate chelating agents are increasing steadily for applications that include 
inhibition of scale and corrosion, metal fi  nishing, cleaning and laundry agents, ore recovery, and 
petroleum drilling. They are used in agricultural applications and in pulp, paper, and textile produc-
tion. In part because of the diffi  culty in determining low levels of these substances in water, their 
environmental chemistry is not very well known. Although they are not very biodegradable, they 
interact strongly with surfaces and are removed with the sludge from biological waste treatment. 
3.17 COMPLEXATION BY HUMIC SUBSTANCES
The most important class of complexing agents that occur naturally are the humic substances . 
These are degradation-resistant materials formed during the decomposition of vegetation that occur 
as deposits in soil, marsh sediments, peat, coal, lignite, or in almost any location where large quanti-
ties of v egetation ha v e deca y ed. Humic substances abound in natural waters and soil.6 They are 
commonly classifi  ed on the basis of solubility. If a material containing humic substances is extracted 
with strong base, and the resulting solution is acidifi  ed, the products are (a) a nonextractable plant 
residue called  humin ; (b) a material that precipitates from the acidifi  ed extract, called humic acid ; 
and (c) an organic material that remains in the acidifi  ed solution, called fulvic acid . Because of their 
acid–base, sorptive, and complexing properties, both the soluble and insoluble humic substances 
have a strong effect upon the properties of water. In general, fulvic acid dissolves in water and exerts 
its effects as the soluble species. Humin and humic acid remain insoluble and affect water quality 
through exchange of species, such as cations or organic materials, with water.
Humic substances are high-molecular-mass, polyelectrolytic macromolecules. Molecular masses 
range from a few hundred for fulvic acid to tens of thousands for the humic acid and humin frac-
tions. These substances contain a carbon skeleton with a high degree of aromatic character and with 
a large percentage of the molecular mass incorporated in functional groups, most of which contain 
oxygen. The elementary composition of most humic substances is within the following ranges: 
C, 45–55%; O, 30–45%; H, 3–6%; N, 1–5%; and S, 0–1%. The terms humin , humic acid , and 
f ulvic acid  do not refer to single compounds but to a wide range of compounds of generally similar 
origin with many properties in common. Humic substances have been known since before 1 800, 
but their structural and chemical characteristics are still being explained.78 Environmental Chemistry
Some feeling for the nature of humic substances may be obtained by considering the structure of 
a hypothetical molecule of fulvic acid shown:
C
CO2H H3CHO CO2HO
CHH
OHOH
CO2H
OH
CO2H
OHH
OHH
HH
HHCH3HO2CCO2H
This structure is typical of the type of compound composing fulvic acid. The compound has a for-
mula mass of 666, and its chemical formula may be represented as C20H15(CO2H)6(OH)5(CO)2. As 
shown in the hypothetical compound, the functional groups that may be present in fulvic acid are 
carboxyl, phenolic hydroxyl, alcoholic hydroxyl, and carbonyl. The functional groups vary with the 
particular acid sample. Approximate ranges in units of milliequivalents per gram of acid are total 
acidity, 12–14; carboxyl, 8–9; phenolic hydroxyl, 3–6; alcoholic hydroxyl, 3–5; and carbonyl, 1–3. 
In addition, some methoxyl groups, -OCH3, may be encountered at low levels.
The binding of metal ions by humic substances is one of the most important environmental 
qualities of humic substances. This binding can occur as chelation between a carboxyl group and a 
phenolic hydroxyl group, as chelation between two carboxyl groups, or as complexation with a 
 carboxyl group (see Figure 3.13).
One of the most signifi  cant characteristics of humic substances is their ability to bind with metal 
cations. Iron and aluminum are very strongly bound to humic substances, whereas magnesium is 
rather weakly bound. Other common ions, such as Ni2+, Pb2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+, are intermediate in 
their binding to humic substances.
The role played by soluble fulvic acid complexes of metals in natural waters is not well known. 
They probably keep some of the biologically important transition-metal ions in solution, and are 
particularly involved in iron solubilization and transport. Yellow fulvic acid-type compounds called 
Gelbstoffe , and frequently encountered along with soluble iron, are associated with color in water.
Insoluble humins and humic acids, effectively exchange cations with water and may accumulate 
large quantities of metals. Lignite coal, which is largely a humic acid material, tends to remove 
some metal ions from water.
Special attention has been given to humic substances since about 1970, following the discovery 
of trihalomethanes (THMs, such as chloroform and dibromochloromethane) in water supplies. It is 
now generally believed that these suspected carcinogens can be formed in the presence of humic 
substances during the disinfection of raw municipal drinking water by chlorination (see Chapter 8). 
The humic substances produce THMs by reaction with chlorine. The formation of THMs can be 
reduced by removing as much of the humic material as possible prior to chlorination.

3.18 COMPLEXATION AND REDOX PROCESSES
Complexation may have a strong effect upon oxidation–reduction equilibria by shifting reactions, 
such as that for the oxidation of lead,

levels. Perhaps more important is the fact that upon oxidation,
 + /arrowpairrightleft1

many metals form self-protective coatings of oxides, carbonates, or other insoluble species that 
prevent further chemical reaction. Copper and aluminum roofi  ng and structural iron are examples 
of materials that are thus self-protecting. A chelating agent in contact with such metals can result in 
continual dissolution of the protective coating so that the exposed metal corrodes readily. For exam-
ple, chelating agents in wastewater may increase the corrosion of metal plumbing, thus adding 
heavy metals to effl  uents. Solutions of chelating agents employed to clean metal surfaces in metal 
plating operations have a similar effect.

Aquatic Chemistry
4.1 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF OXIDATION–REDUCTION
Oxidation–reduction (redox ) reactions are those involving changes of oxidation states of reactants. 
Such reactions are easiest to visualize as the transfer of electrons from one species to another. For 
example, soluble cadmium ion, Cd2+, is removed from wastewater by reaction with metallic iron. 
The overall reaction is
 +++Æ +22Cd Fe Cd Fe  (4.1)
This reaction is the sum of two half-reactions , a reduction half-reaction in which cadmium ion 
accepts two electrons and is reduced,
 2Cd 2 Cd e+-+Æ  (4.2)
and an oxidation half-reaction in which elemental iron is oxidized:
 2Fe Fe 2 e+-Æ+  (4.3)
When these two half-reactions are added algebraically, the electrons cancel on both sides and the 
result is the overall reaction given in Equation 4.1.
Oxidation–reduction phenomena are highly signifi  cant in the environmental chemistry of natu-
ral waters and wastewaters. In a lake, for example, the reduction of oxygen (O2) by organic matter 
(represented by {CH2O}),
 +Æ +22 2 2{ C HO } O C O HO  (4.4)
results in oxygen depletion, which can kill fi  sh. The rate at which sewage is oxidized is crucial to 
the operation of a waste treatment plant. Reduction of insoluble iron(III) to soluble iron(II),

in a reservoir contaminates the water with dissolved iron, which is hard to remove in the water treat-
ment plant. Oxidation of NH4+ to NO3- in water
 +- ++Æ + +42 3 2NH 2O NO 2H H O  (4.6)84 Environmental Chemistry
converts ammonium nitrogen to nitrate, a form more assimilable by algae in the water. Many other 
examples can be cited of the ways in which the types, rates, and equilibria of redox reactions largely 
determine the nature of important solute species in water.
This chapter discusses redox processes and equilibria in water. In so doing, it emphasizes the 
concept of p E, analogous to pH and defi  ned as the negative log of electron activity. Low p E values 
are indicative of reducing conditions; high p E values refl  ect oxidizing conditions.
Two important points should be stressed regarding redox reactions in natural waters and  wastewaters. 
First, as is discussed in Chapter 6, “Aquatic Microbial Biochemistry,” many of the most important redox 
reactions are catalyzed by microorganisms. Bacteria are the catalysts by which molecular oxygen reacts 
with organic matter, iron(III) is reduced to iron(II), and ammonia is oxidized to nitrate ion.
The second important point regarding redox reactions in the hydrosphere is their close relationship 
to acid–base reactions. Whereas the activity of the H+ ion is used to express the extent to which water 
is acidic or basic, the activity of the electron, e-, is used to express the degree to which an aquatic 
medium is oxidizing or reducing. Water with a high hydrogen-ion activity, such as runoff from “acid 
rain,” is acidic . By analogy, water with a high electron activity, such as that in the anoxic digester of a 
sewage treatment plant, is said to be reducing . Water with a low H+ ion  activity (high concentration of 
OH-)—such as landfi  ll leachate contaminated with waste sodium hydroxide—is basic , whereas water 
with a low electron activity—highly chlorinated water, for example—is said to be oxidizing . Actually, 
neither free electrons nor free H+ ions as such are found dissolved in aquatic solution; they are always 
strongly associated with solvent or solute species. However, the concept of electron activity, like that 
of hydrogen-ion activity, remains a very useful one to the aquatic chemist.
Many species in water undergo exchange of both electrons and H+ ions. For example, acid mine 
water contains the hydrated iron(III) ion, Fe(H2O)63+, which readily loses H+ ion
 ++ ++ /arrowpairrightleft32
26 25 Fe(H O) Fe(H O) OH H  (4.7)
to contribute acidity to the medium. The same ion accepts an electron
 /arrowpairrightleft32
26 26 Fe(H O) Fe(H O) e+- ++  (4.8)
to give iron(II).
Generally, the transfer of electrons in a redox reaction is accompanied by H+ ion transfer, and 
there is a close relationship between redox and acid–base processes. For example, if iron(II) loses 
an electron at pH 7, three hydrogen ions are also lost to form highly insoluble iron(II) hydroxide,
 /arrowpairrightleft2
26 3 2 Fe(H O) Fe(OH) ( ) 3H O 3H es+- +++ + (4.9)
an insoluble, gelatinous solid.
The stratifi  ed body of water shown in Figure 4.1 can be used to illustrate redox phenomena and 
relationships in an aquatic system. The anoxic sediment layer is so reducing that carbon can be 
reduced to its lowest possible oxidation state, -4 in CH4. If the lake becomes anoxic, the hypolimnion 
may contain elements in their reduced states: NH4+ for nitrogen, H2S for sulfur, and soluble Fe(H2O)62+ 
for iron. Saturation with atmospheric oxygen makes the surface layer a relatively oxidizing medium. 
If allowed to reach thermodynamic equilibrium, it is characterized by the more oxidized forms of the 
elements present: CO2 for carbon, NO3- for nitrogen, iron as insoluble Fe(OH)3, and sulfur as SO42-. 
Substantial changes in the distribution of chemical species in water resulting from redox reactions are 
vitally important to aquatic organisms and have a tremendous infl  uence on water quality.
It should be pointed out that the systems presented in this chapter are assumed to be at equili-
brium, a state almost never achieved in any real natural water or wastewater system. Most real Oxidation–Reduction in Aquatic Chemistry 85
aquatic systems are dynamic systems that may approach a steady state, rather than true equilibrium. 
Nevertheless, the picture of a system at equilibrium is very useful in visualizing trends in natural 
water and wastewater systems, yet the model is still simple enough to comprehend. It is important 
to realize the limitations of such a model, however, especially in trying to make measurements of 
the redox status of water.
4.2 ELECTRON AND REDOX REACTIONS
In order to explain redox processes in natural waters, it is necessary to have an understanding of 
redox reactions. In a formal sense such reactions can be viewed as the transfer of electrons between 
species. This section considers such reactions in a simple system. All redox reactions involve 
changes in the oxidation states of some of the species that take part in the reaction. Consider, for 
example, a solution containing iron(II) and iron(III) that is suffi  ciently acidic to prevent precipita-
tion of solid Fe(OH)3; such a medium might be acid mine water or a steel pickling liquor waste. 
Suppose that the solution is treated with elemental hydrogen gas over a suitable catalyst to bring 
about the reduction of iron(III) to iron(II). The overall reaction can be represented as
 ++ +++ /arrowpairrightleft32
2 2Fe H 2Fe 2H  (4.10)
The reaction is written with a double arrow, indicating that it is reversible  and could proceed in either 
direction; for normal concentrations of reaction participants, this reaction goes to the right. As the 
reaction goes to the right, the hydrogen is oxidized  as it changes from an oxidation state  (number) of 
0 in elemental H2 to a higher oxidation number of +1 in H+. The oxidation state of iron goes from 
+3 in Fe3+ to +2 in Fe2+; the oxidation number of iron decreases, which means that it is reduced .
All redox reactions such as this one can be broken down into a reduction half-reaction , in this case

concentration (oxidizing, high p E) near the surface and a low oxygen concentration (reducing, low p E) near 
the bottom.86 Environmental Chemistry
Note that adding these two half-reactions together gives the overall reaction. The addition of 
an oxidation half-reaction and a reduction half-reaction, each expressed for the same number of 
electrons so that the electrons cancel on both sides of the arrows, gives a whole redox reaction .
The equilibrium of a redox reaction, that is, the degree to which the reaction as written tends to 
lie to the right or left, can be deduced from information about its constituent half-reactions. To 
v isualize this, assume that the two half-reactions can be separated into two half-cells of an 
e lectrochemical cell as shown for Reaction 4.10 in Figure 4.2.
If the initial activities of H+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ were of the order of 1 (concentrations of 1 M), and if 
the pressure of H2 were 1 atm, H2 would be oxidized to H+ in the left half-cell, Fe3+ would be reduced 
to Fe2+ in the right half-cell, and ions would migrate through the salt bridge to maintain electro-
neutrality in both half-cells. The net reaction occurring would be Reaction 4.10.
If a voltmeter were inserted in the circuit between the two electrodes, no signifi  cant current could 
fl ow and the two half-reactions could not take place. However, the voltage registered by the volt-
meter would be a measure of the relative tendencies of the two half-reactions to occur. In the left 
half-cell the oxidation half-reaction
 /arrowpairrightleft2H2 H 2 e+-+  (4.12)
will tend to go to the right, releasing electrons to the platinum electrode in the half-cell and 
 giving that electrode a relatively negative ( -) potential. In the right half-cell, the reduction 
 half-reaction
 /arrowpairrightleft322Fe Fe e+- ++  (4.11)
will tend to go to the right, taking electrons from the platinum electrode in the half-cell and giving 
that electrode a relatively positive ( +) potential. The difference in these potentials is a measure of the 
“driving force” of the overall reaction. If each of the reaction participants were at unit activity, the 
potential difference would be 0.77 V.
The left electrode shown in Figure 4.2 is the standard electrode against which all other electrode 
potentials are compared. It is called the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE ). This electrode has

been assigned a potential value of exactly 0 V by convention, and its half-reaction is written as the 
following:
 /arrowpairrightleft0
2 2H 2 H , 0.00V e+-+= E  (4.13)
The measured potential of the right-hand electrode in Figure 4.2 versus the SHE is called the  electrode 
potential , E. If the Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions are both at unit activity, the potential is the standard electrode 
potential  (according to IUPAC convention, the standard reduction potential ), E 0. The standard elec-
trode potential for the Fe3+/Fe2+ couple is 0.77 V expressed conventionally as follows:
 /arrowpairrightleft32 0Fe Fe , 0.77V e+- ++= + E  (4.14)
4.3 ELECTRON ACTIVITY AND p E
In this book, for the most part, p E and p E0 are used instead of E and E0 to more clearly illustrate 
redox equilibria in aquatic systems over many orders of magnitude of electron activity in a manner 
analogous to pH. Numerically, p E and p E0 are simply the following:
 p (at 25°C)2.303 / 0.0591==EEERT F (4.15)
 ==00
0p (at 25°C)2.303 / 0.0591EEERT F (4.16)
where R is the molar gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and F is the Faraday constant. 
The “p E concept” is explained below.
Just as pH is defi  ned as
 pH = -log(aH+) (4.17)
where aH+ is the activity of hydrogen ion in solution, p E is defi  ned as
 p E = -log(ae-) (4.18)
where ae- is the activity of the electron in solution. Since hydrogen-ion concentration may vary 
over many orders of magnitude, pH is a convenient way of expressing aH+ in terms of manageable 
numbers. Similarly, electron activities in water may vary over more than 20 orders of magnitude so 
that it is convenient to express ae- as pE.
Values of p E are defi  ned in terms of the following half-reaction for which p E0 is defi  ned as 
exactly zero:*
 /arrowpairrightleft00
2 2H ( ) 2 H ( ), 0.00V, p 0.00 aq e g+-+= + = EE  (4.19)
* Thermodynamically, the free-energy change for this reaction is defi  ned as exactly zero when all reaction participants are 
at unit activity. For ionic solutes, activity—the effective concentration in a sense—approaches concentration at low con-
centrations and low ionic strengths. The activity of a gas is equal to its partial pressure. Furthermore, the free energy, G, 
decreases for spontaneous processes occurring at constant temperature and pressure. Processes for which the free-energy 
change, DG, is zero have no tendency toward spontaneous change and are in a state of equilibrium. Reaction 4.13 is the 
one upon which free energies of formation of all ions in aqueous solution are based. It also forms the basis for defi  ning 
free-energy changes for oxidation–reduction processes in water.88 Environmental Chemistry
It is relatively easy to visualize the activities of ions in terms of concentration, whereas it is harder 
to visualize the activity of the electron, and therefore p E, in similar terms. For example, at 25°C in 
pure water, a medium of zero ionic strength, the hydrogen-ion concentration is 1.0 ¥ 10-7 M, the 
hydrogen-ion activity  is 1.0 ¥ 10-7, and the pH is 7.0. The electron activity, however, must be defi  ned 
in terms of Equation 4.19. When H+ (aq) at unit activity is in equilibrium with hydrogen gas at 1 atm 
pressure (and likewise at unit activity), the activity of the electron in the medium is exactly 1.00 and 
the p E is 0.0. If the electron activity were increased by a factor of 10 (as would be the case if H+ (aq) 
at an activity of 0.100 were in equilibrium with H2 at an activity of 1.00), the electron activity would 
be 10 and the p E value would be -1.0.
4.4 THE NERNST EQUATION
The Nernst equation  is used to account for the effect of different activities upon electrode potential. 
Referring to Figure 4.2, if the Fe3+ ion concentration is increased relative to the Fe2+ ion concentra-
tion, it is readily visualized that the potential and the p E of the right electrode will become more 
positive because the higher concentration of electron-defi  cient Fe3+ ions clustered around it tends to 
draw electrons from the electrode. Decreased Fe3+ ion or increased Fe2+ ion concentration has the 
opposite effect. Such concentration effects upon E and p E are expressed by the Nernst equation . As 
applied to the half-reaction
 +- ++= + =/arrowpairrightleft32 0 0Fe Fe , 0.77 V, p 13.2 eE E  (4.20)
the Nernst equation is the following, where 2.303 RT/F = 0.0591 at 25°C:

where n is the number of electrons involved in the half-reaction (1 in this case), and  the  activities of 
Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions have been taken as their concentrations (a simplifi  cation valid  for more dilute 
solutions, which will be made throughout this chapter). Considering that

The Nernst equation in this form is quite simple and offers some advantages in calculating redox 
relationships.
If, for example, the value of [Fe3+] is 2.35 ¥ 10-3 M and [Fe2+] = 7.85 ¥ 10-5 M, the value of 
pE is

As the concentration of Fe3+ increases relative to the concentration of Fe2+, the value of p E becomes 
higher (more positive) and as the concentration of Fe2+ increases relative to the concentration of Fe3+, 
the value of p E becomes lower (more negative).
4.5 REACTION TENDENCY: WHOLE REACTION FROM HALF-REACTIONS
This section discusses how half-reactions can be combined to give whole reactions and how the p E0 
values of the half-reactions can be used to predict the directions in which reactions will go. The 
half-reactions discussed here are the following:
 /arrowpairrightleft20Hg 2 Hg, p 13.35 e+-+= E  (4.24)
 /arrowpairrightleft32 0Fe Fe , p 13.2 e+- ++= E  (4.25)
 /arrowpairrightleft20Cu 2 Cu, p 5.71 e+-+= E  (4.26)
 /arrowpairrightleft0
2 2H 2 H , p 0.00 e+-+= E  (4.27)
 /arrowpairrightleft20Pb 2 Pb, p 2.13 e+-+= - E  (4.28)
Such half-reactions and their p E0 values can be used to explain observations such as the following: 
A solution of Cu2+ fl ows through a lead pipe and the lead acquires a layer of copper metal through 
the reaction
 Cu2+ + Pb Æ Cu + Pb2+ (4.29)
This reaction occurs because the copper(II) ion has a greater tendency to acquire electrons than the 
lead ion has to retain them. This reaction can be obtained by subtracting the lead half-reaction, 
Equation 4.28, from the copper half-reaction, Equation 4.26:
 /arrowpairrightleft20Cu 2 Cu, p 5.71 e+-+= E  (4.26)
 /arrowpairrightleft20(Pb 2 Pb), p 2.13 e+--+ = - E  (4.28)
 ++++ =/arrowpairrightleft22 0Cu Pb Cu Pb , p 7.84 E  (4.30)
The positive value of p E0 for this reaction, 7.84, indicates that the reaction tends to go to the right as 
written. This occurs when lead metal directly contacts a solution of copper(II) ion. Therefore, if a 
waste solution containing copper(II) ion, a relatively innocuous pollutant, comes into contact with 
lead in plumbing, toxic lead may go into solution.
In principle, half-reactions may be allowed to occur in separate electrochemical half-cells, as 
could occur for Reaction 4.30 in the cell shown in Figure 4.3 if the meter (p E) were bypassed by an 
electrical conductor; they are therefore called cell reactions .
If the activities of Cu2+ and Pb2+ are not unity, the direction of the reaction and value of p E are 
deduced from the Nernst equation. For Reaction 4.30 the Nernst equation is
 ++
++=+ = +22
0

By combining the appropriate half-reactions, it can be shown that copper metal will not cause hydro-

does copper(II) ion], whereas lead metal, in contrast, will displace hydrogen gas from acidic solutions.
4.6 THE NERNST EQUATION AND CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM
Refer again to Figure 4.3. Imagine that instead of the cell being set up to measure the potential between 
the copper and lead electrodes, the voltmeter used to measure p E was removed and the electrodes 
directly connected with a wire so that the current might fl  ow between them. The reaction

will occur until the concentration of lead ion becomes so high, and that of copper ion so low, that 
the reaction stops. The system is at equilibrium and, since current no longer fl  ows, p E is exactly 
zero. The equilibrium constant K for the reaction is given by the expression

The equilibrium constant for a redox reaction involving n electrons is given in terms of p E 
simply by
 log K = n(pE0) (4.34)
4.7 THE RELATIONSHIP OF p E TO FREE ENERG Y
Aquatic systems and the organisms that inhabit them—just like the steam engine or students  hoping 
to pass physical chemistry—must obey the laws of thermodynamics. Bacteria, fungi, and human 
beings derive their energy from acting as mediators (catalysts) of chemical reactions and extracting 
a certain percentage of useful energy from them. In predicting or explaining the beha vior of an 
aquatic system, it is helpful to be able to predict the useful energy that can be extracted from chemi-
cal reactions in the system, such as microbially mediated oxidation of organic matter to CO2 and 
water, or the fermentation of organic matter to methane by anoxic bacteria in the absence of oxygen. 
Such information may be obtained by knowing the free-energy change, DG, for the redox reaction; 
DG, in turn, may be obtained from p E for the reaction. The free-energy change for a redox reaction 
involving n electrons at an absolute temperature of T is given by
 D G = -2.303 nRT(pE) (4.35)
where R is the gas constant. When all reaction participants are in their standard states (pure liquids, 
pure solids, solutes at an activity of 1.00, gas pressures at 1 atm), DG is the standard free-energy 
change, DG0, given by
 D G0 = -2.303 nRT(pE0) (4.36)
4.8 REACTIONS IN TERMS OF ONE ELECTRON-MOLE
For comparing free-energy changes between different redox reactions, it is most meaningful to 
consider the reactions in terms of the transfer of exactly 1 mol of electrons. This concept may be 
understood by considering two typical and important redox reactions that occur in aquatic 
systems—nitrifi  cation
 +- +++ + = /arrowpairrightleft40
23 2 NH 2O NO 2H H O, p 5.85 E  (4.37)
and oxidation of iron(II) to iron(III): 
 ++++ + = /arrowpairrightleft20
22 3 4Fe O 10H O 4Fe(OH) ( ) 8H , p 7.6 s E  (4.38)
What do reactions written in this way really mean? If any thermodynamic calculations are to be 
made involving the reactions, Reaction 4.37 means that 1 mol of ammonium ion reacts with 2 mol of 
elemental oxygen to yield 1 mol of nitrate ion, 2 mol of hydrogen ion, and 1 mol of water. Reaction 4.38 
is taken to mean that 4 mol of iron(II) ion react with 1 mol of oxygen and 10 mol of water to produce 
4 mol of Fe(OH)3 and 8 mol of hydrogen ions. The free-energy changes calculated for these quanti-
ti es o f reacti on parti ci pan ts do not enab l e meanin gful comparisons o f their free-energy chan g es . 
Such comparisons may be made, though, on the common basis of the transfer of 1 mol of electrons, 
writing each reaction in terms of one electron-mole. The advantage of this approach is illustrated by 
considering Reaction 4.37, which involves an eight-electron change, and Reaction 4.38, which 
involves a four-electron change. Rewriting Equation 4.37 for one electron-mole yields
 +- +++ + = /arrowpairrightleft0 11 11 1
42 3 2 84 84 8NH O NO H H O, p 5.85 E  (4.39)92 Environmental Chemistry

 ++++ + = /arrowpairrightleft20 5 1
22 3 42 Fe O H O Fe(OH) ( ) 2H , p 7.6 s E  (4.40)
From Equation 4.36, the standard free-energy change for a reaction is
 D G0 = -2.303 nRT(pE0) (4.36),
which, for a one electron-mole reaction is simply
 D G0 = -2.303 RT(pE0) (4.36).
Therefore, for reactions written in terms of one electron-mole, a comparison of p E0 values provides 
a direct comparison of DG0 values.
As shown in Equation 4.34 for a redox reaction involving n electrons, p E0 is related to the equi-
librium constant by
 log K = n(pE0) (4.41)
which for a one electron-mole reaction becomes simply
 log K = pE0 (4.42)
Reaction 4.39, the nitrifi  cation reaction written in terms of one electron-mole, has a p E0 value of 
+5.85. The equilibrium-constant expression for this reaction is

Table 4.1 is a compilation of p E0 values for redox reactions that are especially important in 
aquatic systems. Most of these values are calculated from thermodynamic data rather than from

 electrode systems that might be devised do not give potential responses corresponding to the 
Nernst equation; that is, they do not behave reversibly . It is true that one may place a platinum 
electrode and a reference electrode in water and measure a potential. This potential, referred to the 
SHE, is the so-called EH value. Furthermore, the measured potential will be more positive (more 
oxidizing) in an oxidizing medium, such as the oxic surface layers of a lake, than in a reducing 
medium, such as the anaerobic bottom regions of a body of water. However, attaching any quanti-
tative signifi  cance to the EH value measured directly with an electrode is a very dubious practice. 
Acid mine waters containing relatively high levels of sulfuric acid and dissolved iron give reason-
ably accurate EH values by direct measurement, but most aquatic systems do not yield meaningful 
values of EH. The most accurate method of assessing the redox status of water is through calcula-
tion of oxidative capacity , a parameter analogous to buffer capacity for acids and bases and con-
sisting of a single descriptive parameter derived from the sum of the species that can be oxidized 
or reduced.Oxidation–Reduction in Aquatic Chemistry 93

These two reactions determine the limits of p E in water. On the oxidizing side (relatively more 
positive p E values), the p E value is limited by the oxidation of water, half-reaction 4.45. The evolu-
tion of hydrogen, Half-reaction 4.46, limits the p E value on the reducing side.
The condition under which oxygen from the oxidation of water has a pressure of 1.00 atm can be 
regarded as the oxidizing limit of water, whereas a hydrogen pressure of 1.00 atm may be regarded as 
the reducing limit of water. These are boundary conditions  that enable calculation of the stability

more positive than the one given by Equation 4.49 cannot exist at equilibrium in water in contact 
with the atmosphere.

For neutral water (pH = 7.00), substitution into Equations 4.52 and 4.49 yields -7.00 to 13.75 for the 
pE range of water. The p E–pH boundaries of stability for water are shown by the dashed lines in 
Figure 4.4 of Section 4.11.
The decomposition of water is very slow in the absence of a suitable catalyst. Therefore, 
water may have temporary nonequilibrium p E values more negative than the reducing limit or more 
positive than the oxidizing limit. A common example of the latter is a solution of chlorine in water.

present in water at equilibrium. An obviously signifi  cant p E value is that of neutral water in thermo-
dynamic equilibrium with the atmosphere. In water under these conditions, 
2OP = 0.21 atm and

complexes, and different forms of the solid metal oxide or hydroxide may exist in different 
regions described by the p E–pH diagram. Most waters contain carbonate, and many contain 
 sulfates and sulfi  des, so that various metal carbonates, sulfates, and sulfi  des may predominate in 
different regions of the diagram. In order to illustrate the principles involved, however, a 
 simplifi  ed p E–pH diagram is considered here. The reader is referred to more advanced works on 
 geochemistry and aquatic chemistry for more complicated (and more realistic) p E–pH

[The constants Ksp and K¢sp are derived from the solubility products of Fe(OH)2 and Fe(OH)3, res-
pectively, and are expressed in terms of [H+] to facilitate the calculations.] Note that the formation of 
species such as Fe(OH)2+, Fe(OH)2+, and solid FeCO3 or FeS, all of which might be of signifi  cance 
in a natural water system, is not considered. Rapid hydrolysis of iron(III) in solution yields solid 
ferrihydrite, a hydrated iron(III) hydroxide/oxide with a high surface area and strong affi  nity to 
coprecipitate metals other than iron.
In constructing the p E–pH diagram, several boundaries must be considered. The fi  rst two of 
these are the oxidizing and reducing limits of water (see Section 4.9). At the high p E end, the 
 stability limit of water is defi  ned by Equation 4.49 derived previously:
 p E = 20.75 - pH (4.49)
The low p E limit is defi  ned by Equation 4.52:
 p E = -pH (4.52)
The p E-pH diagram constructed for the iron system must fall between the boundaries defi  ned by 
these two equations.
Below pH 3, Fe3+ may exist in equilibrium with Fe2+. The boundary line that separates these two 
species, where [Fe3+] = [Fe2+], is given by the following calculation:

At pE exceeding 13.2, as the pH increases from very low values, Fe(OH)3 precipitates from a 
solution of Fe3+. The pH at which precipitation occurs depends, of course, upon the concentration Oxidation–Reduction in Aquatic Chemistry 97
of Fe3+. In this example, a maximum soluble iron concentration of 1.00  ¥ 10-5 M has been chosen 
so that at the Fe3+/Fe(OH)3 boundary, [Fe3+] = 1.00  ¥ 10-5 M. Substitution in Equation 4.61

All of the equations needed to prepare the p E-pH diagram for iron in water have now been 
derived. To summarize, the equations are (Equation 4.49), O2-H2O boundary; (Equation 4.52), 
H2-H2O boundary; (Equation 4.64), Fe3+-Fe2+ boundary; (Equation 4.66), Fe3+-Fe(OH)3 bound-
ary; (Equation 4.68), Fe2+-Fe(OH)2 boundary; (Equation 4.70), Fe2+-Fe(OH)3 boundary; and 
(Equation 4.72), Fe(OH)2-Fe(OH)3 boundary.
The p E-pH diagram for the iron system in water is shown in Figure 4.4. In this system, at a 
 relatively high hydrogen-ion activity and high electron activity (an acidic reducing medium), iron(II) ion, 
Fe2+, is the predominant iron species; some groundwaters contain appreciable levels of iron(II) under 
these conditions. (In most natural water systems the solubility range of Fe2+ is relatively narrow because 98 Environmental Chemistry
of the precipitation of FeS or FeCO3.) At a very high hydrogen-ion activity and low electron activity 
(an acidic oxidizing medium), Fe3+ ion predominates. In an oxidizing medium at lower acidity, solid 
Fe(OH)3 is the primary iron species present. Finally, in a basic reducing medium, with low hydrogen-
ion activity and high electron activity, solid Fe(OH)2 can be stable.
Note that within the pH regions normally encountered in a natural aquatic system (approximately 
pH 5 -9) Fe(OH)3 or Fe2+ is the predominant stable iron species. In fact, it is observed that in waters 
containing dissolved oxygen at any appreciable level (a relatively high p E), hydrated iron(III) oxide 
Fe(OH)3 is essentially the only inorganic iron species found. Such waters contain a high level of 
suspended iron, but any truly soluble iron must be in the form of a complex (see Chapter 3).
In highly anoxic, low-p E water, appreciable levels of Fe2+ may be present. When such water is 
exposed to atmospheric oxygen, the p E rises and Fe(OH)3 precipitates. The resulting deposits of 
hydrated iron(III) oxide can stain laundry and bathroom fi  xtures with a refractory red/brown stain. 
This phenomenon also explains why red iron oxide deposits are found near pumps and springs that 
bring deep, anaerobic water to the surface. In shallow wells, where the water may become oxic, 
solid Fe(OH)3 may precipitate on the well walls, clogging the aquifer outlet. This usually occurs 
through bacterially mediated reactions, which are discussed in Chapter 6.
One species not yet considered is elemental iron. For the half-reaction
 /arrowpairrightleft20Fe 2 Fe, p 7.45 e+-+= - E  (4.73)
the Nernst equation gives p E as a function of [Fe2+]
 p E = -7.45 + 1
2log[Fe2+] (4.74)
For iron metal in equilibrium with 1.00  ¥ 10-5 M Fe2+, the following p E value is obtained:
 p E = -7.45 + 1
2log 1.00 ¥ 10-5 = -9.95 (4.75)
Examination of Figure 4.4 shows that the p E values for elemental iron in contact with Fe2+ are below 
the reducing limit of water. This shows that iron metal in contact with water is thermodynamically 
unstable with respect to reducing water and going into solution as Fe2+, a factor that contributes to 
the tendency of iron to undergo corrosion.
4.12 HUMIC SUBSTANCES AS NATURAL REDUCTANTS
Humic substances (see Section 3.17) are oxidation–reduction-active species that may be signifi  cant 
as reducing species in chemical and biochemical processes that occur in natural water and waste-
water systems. The capability of humic substances to act as reductants is due primarily to the pres-
ence of the quinone/hydroquinone group that acts as an oxidation–reduction couple as follows:

Quinone Hydroquinone  (4.76)
 
There is some evidence suggesting that soluble humic substances can act as intermediates in the 
reduction of species in water by solid reductants, such as solid iron(II) species.Oxidation–Reduction in Aquatic Chemistry 99
It is believed that in addition to being reducing agents, humic substances act as electron shut-
tles to transfer electrons to iron(III) in the microorganism-mediated bioreduction of iron(III) to 
iron(II) in water.3 The process is faster in the presence of high carboxyl ( -CO2H) group content in 
the humic substances presence indicati v e of the importance of comple xation of iron ions by the 
humic substance.
4.13 PHOTOCHEMICAL PROCESSES IN OXIDATION–REDUCTION
As discussed in Chapter 9, absorption of a light photon can introduce a high level of energy into chemi-
cal species that can become involved in oxidation–reduction processes in water. An important oxidiz-
ing agent in water exposed to sunlight is believed to be superoxide ion , O2∑-, produced by the action of 
photochemically excited natural organic matter (humic substance) upon dissolved O2. This superoxide 
species is a free radical  (see Chapter 9) with an unpaired electron denoted by the dot in the formula 
O2∑-. Superoxide ion is capable of oxidizing inorganically complexed metals such as iron.
An important intermediate involved with photochemically induced oxidation processes in water 
is hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, generated when O2∑- reacts with water. In the presence of iron(II) the 
Fenton reaction,
 Fe(II) + H2O2 Æ Fe(III) + OH- + HO∑ (4.77)
generates hydroxyl radical, HO∑. Hydroxyl radical is a very reactive species that reacts with even 
refractory organic species, leading to their oxidation. As a consequence of reactions involving 
superoxide radical ion and hydroxyl radical, photochemical processes are important in promoting 
oxidation of oxidizable species in water.
Aqueous suspensions of TiO2 are photochemically active. When photons of ultraviolet radiation 
of a wavelength <318 nm ( hn) strike a TiO2 surface,
 TiO2 + hn Æ e-

conduction band electrons ( e-
cb) capable of initiating photoreduction and valence band holes ( h+
vb) 
capable of initiating photooxidation are produced. This has led to interest in the use of suspensions 
of TiO2 exposed to sunlight to photoreduce and photooxidize pollutant and hazardous waste 
species. 
4.14 CORROSION
One of the most damaging redox phenomena is corrosion , defi ned as the destructive alteration of 
metal through interactions with its surroundings. In addition to its multibillion dollar annual 
costs due to destruction of equipment and structures, corrosion introduces metals into water  systems 
and destroys pollution control equipment and waste disposal pipes; it is aggravated by water and air 
pollutants and some kinds of hazardous wastes (see corrosive wastes in Chapter 20, Section 20.6).
Thermodynamically, all commonly used metals are unstable relative to their environments. 
Elemental metals tend to undergo chemical changes to produce the more stable forms of ions, salts, 
oxides, and hydroxides. Fortunately, the rates of corrosion are normally slow, so that metals exposed 
to air and water may endure for long periods of time. However, protective measures are necessary. 
Sometimes these measures fail; for example, witness the gaping holes in automobile bodies exposed 
to salt used to control road ice.
Corrosion normally occurs when an electrochemical cell is set up on a metal surface. The area 
corroded is the anode, where the following oxidation reaction occurs, illustrated for the formation 
of a divalent metal ion from a metal, M:
 M Æ M2+ + 2e- (4.79)100 Environmental Chemistry
Several cathodic reactions are possible. One of the most common of these is the reduction of 
H+ ion:
 2H+ + 2e- Æ H2 (4.80)
Oxygen may also be involved in cathodic reactions, including reduction to hydroxide, reduction to 
water, and reduction to hydrogen peroxide:
 O2 + 2H2O + 4e- Æ 4OH- (4.81)
 O2 + 4H+ + 4e- Æ 2H2O (4.82)
 O2 + 2H2O + 2e- Æ 2OH- + H2O2 (4.83)
Oxygen may either accelerate corrosion processes by participating in reactions, such as these, or 
retard them by forming protective oxide fi  lms. As discussed in Chapter 6, bacteria are often involved 
with corrosion.
Corrosion is a very important consideration in domestic water distribution systems. Metals that 
may be corroded in such systems include iron, copper, lead, and red brass. Corrosion of these mate-
rials involves the redox potential of the water as determined by the solutes in it and the solid materi-
als with which it is in contact. Important factors in corrosion include type and concentration of 
oxidant (usually from added Cl2), metal release rate, and corrosion scale properties of the corroding 
metals.

Aquatic Chemistry
5.1 CHEMICAL INTERACTIONS INVOLVING SOLIDS, GASES, AND WATER
Homogeneous chemical reactions occurring entirely in aqueous solution are rather rare in natural waters 
and wastewaters. Instead, most signifi  cant chemical and biochemical phenomena in water involve inter-
actions between species in water and another phase. Some of these important interactions are illustrated 
in Figure 5.1. Several examples of phase interactions in water illustrated by the fi  gure are the following: 
production of solid biomass through the photosynthetic activity of algae occurs within a suspended algal 
cell and involves exchange of dissolved solids and gases between the surrounding water and the cell. 
Similar exchanges occur when bacteria degrade organic matter (often in the form of small particles) in 
water. Chemical reactions occur that produce solids or gases in water. Iron and many important trace-
level elements are transported through aquatic systems as colloidal chemical compounds or are sorbed 
to solid particles. Pollutant hydrocarbons and some pesticides may be present on the water surface as an 
immiscible liquid fi  lm. Sediment can be washed physically into a body of water.
This chapter discusses the importance of interactions among different phases in aquatic chemi-
cal processes. In a general sense, in addition to water, these phases may be divided between  sediments  
(bulk solids) and suspended colloidal material . The ways in which sediments are formed and the 
signifi  cance of sediments as repositories and sources of aquatic solutes are discussed. Mentioned in 
earlier chapters, solubilities of solids and gases (Henry’s law) are covered here in some detail.
M u c h  o f  thi s  c h a p t e r  d e al s  w i th  th e  b e h a v i o r  o f  c o ll o i d al  m a t e ri al  th a t  c o n s i s t s  o f  v e ry  fi  ne 
 particles of solids, gases, or immiscible liquids suspended in water. Colloidal material is involved 
with many signifi  cant aquatic chemical phenomena. It is very reactive because of its high surface-
area-to-volume ratio.
5.2 IMPORTANCE AND FORMATION OF SEDIMENTS
Sediments  are the layers of relatively fi  nely divided matter covering the bottoms of rivers, 
streams, lakes, reservoirs, bays, estuaries, and oceans. Sediments typically consist of mixtures of 
fi ne-, medium-, and coarse-grained minerals, including clay, silt, and sand, mixed with organic 
 matter. They may vary in composition from pure mineral matter to predominantly organic matter. 
Sediments are reservoirs of a variety of biological, chemical, and pollutant detritus in bodies of 
water and are repositories of pollutants, such as heavy metals and toxic organic compounds. Of 
particular concern is the transfer of chemical species from sediments into aquatic food chains via 
organisms that spend signifi  cant parts of their life cy cles in contact with or living in sediments. 
Among the sediment-dwelling organisms are various kinds of shellfi  sh (shrimp, crayfi  sh, crab, and 
clams) and a variety of worms, insects, amphipods, bivalves, and other smaller organisms that 
are of particular concern because they are located near the base of the food chain.
Pollutant transfer from sediments to organisms may involve an intermediate stage in water solu-
tion as well as direct transfer from sediments to organisms. This is probably particularly important 104 Environmental Chemistry
for poorly water-soluble organophilic pollutants, such as organohalide pesticides. The portion of 
substances held in sediments that is most available to organisms is that contained in pore water , 
obtained in microscopic pores within the sediment mass. Pore water is commonly extracted from 
sediments for measurements of toxicity to aquatic test organisms.
5.2.1 F ORMATION  OF SEDIMENTS
Physical, chemical, and biological processes may all result in the deposition of sediments in the 
 bottom regions of bodies of water. These sediments may eventually be covered and produce sedi-
mentary minerals. Sedimentary material may be simply carried into a body of water by erosion or 
through sloughing (caving in) of the shore. Thus, clay, sand, organic matter, and other materials may 
be washed into a lake and settle out as layers of sediment.
Sediments may be formed by simple precipitation reactions, several of which are discussed 
below. When a phosphate-rich wastewater enters a body of water containing a high concentration of 
calcium ions, the following reaction occurs to produce solid hydroxyapatite:
 5Ca2+ + H2O + 3HPO42- Æ Ca5OH(PO4)3(s) + 4H+ (5.1)
Calcium carbonate sediment may form when water rich in carbon dioxide and containing a 
high level of calcium as temporary hardness (see Section 3.5) loses carbon dioxide to the 
atmosphere:
 Ca2+ + 2HCO3- Æ CaCO3(s) + CO2(g) + H2O (5.2)
or when the pH is raised by a photosynthetic reaction:

Oxidation of reduced forms of an element can result in its transformation to an insoluble species, 
such as occurs when iron(II) is oxidized to iron(III) to produce a precipitate of insoluble iron(III) 
hydroxide:
 4Fe2+ + 10H2O + O2 Æ 4Fe(OH)3(s) + 8H+ (5.4)
A decrease in pH can result in the production of an insoluble humic acid sediment from base-soluble 
organic humic substances in solution (see Section 3.17).
Biological activity is responsible for the formation of some aquatic sediments. Some bacterial 
species produce large quantities of iron(III) oxide (see Section 6.14) as part of their energy- extracting 
mediation of the oxidation of iron(II) to iron(III). In anoxic ( oxygen-defi  cient) bottom regions of 
bodies of water, some bacteria use sulfate ion as an electron receptor:
 SO42- Æ H2S (5.5)
whereas other bacteria reduce iron(III) to iron(II):
 Fe(OH)3(s) Æ Fe2+ (5.6)
These two products can react to give a black layer of iron(II) sulfi  de sediment:
 Fe2+ + H2S Æ FeS( s) + 2H+ (5.7)
This frequently occurs during the winter, alternating with the production of calcium carbonate 
by-product from photosynthesis (Reaction 5.3) during the summer. Under such conditions, a layered 
bottom sediment is produced composed of alternate layers of black FeS and white CaCO3 as shown 
in Figure 5.2.
5.2.2 O RGANIC  AND CARBONACEOUS  SEDIMENTARY  MATERIALS
Carbonaceous sediments from organic materials are particularly important because of their  affi  nity 
for poorly soluble organic water pollutants. (As noted in Section 1.9, in chemical fate and transport 
calculations involving the uptake of organic materials from water by sediments contain ing organic 
solids, the sediment–water partition coeffi  cient for the organic substance partitioning between 
water and soil may be expressed as a function of the fraction of organic matter in the sediment, foc, 
and the partition coeffi  cient of the organic contaminant for the pure organic solid, Koc.) Sediment 
organic carbon comes from biological sources and from fossil fuels. Biological sources may con-
sist of plant, animal, and microbial biomass including materials such as cellulose, lignin, collagen, 
and cuticle, and the degradation products thereof, especially humic substances. Fossil fuel sources 
include coal tar, petroleum residues (such as asphalt), soot, coke, charcoal, and coal.

Lake Zürich in Switzerland.106 Environmental Chemistry
Black carbon  is the name given to small particles of carbon left over from the combustion of 
fossil fuels and biomass. Signifi  cant quantities of black carbon are produced by combustion  processes 
and it is found in atmospheric particulate matter, in soil, and in sediments. Elemental carbon has an 
affi nity for organic matter (see the discussion of activated carbon in Chapter 8) and is a  signifi  cant 
sink for hydrophobic organic compounds in sediments.1
Hydrophobic organic compounds are bound preferentially to sediment organic carbon in sedi-
ments. The two most prominent examples of such compounds are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
(PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). From 60% to 90% of these hydrophobic organic com-
pounds are bound with sediment organic carbon even though typically the sediment organic carbon 
comprises only 5–7% of the sediments. Sediment organic carbon provides a reservoir for the storage 
of hydrophobic organic compounds that may persist for many years after the source of pollution is 
removed. However, compounds held by these solids are relatively less bioavailable and less readily 
biodegraded than compounds that are in solution or are bound to mineral sedimentary materials.
5.3 SOLUBILITIES
The formation and stabilities of nonaqueous phases in water are strongly dependent upon solubili-
ties. Calculations of the solubilities of solids and gases are addressed in this section.
5.3.1  SOLUBILITIES  OF SOLIDS
Generally, the solubility of a solid in water is of concern when the solid is slightly soluble, often 
having such a low solubility that it is called “insoluble.” In Section 3.15 the solubility of lead carbon-
ate was considered. This salt can introduce toxic lead ion into water by reactions such as
 +-+ /arrowpairrightleft22
33 PbCO ( ) Pb CO s  (3.79)
A relatively straightforward calculation of the solubility of an ionic solid can be performed on 
barium sulfate, which dissolves according to the reaction
 +-+ /arrowpairrightleft22
44 BaSO ( ) Ba SO s  (5.8)
for which the equilibrium constant is the following:
 Ksp = [Ba2+][SO42-] = 1.23 ¥ 10-10 (5.9)
An equilibrium constant in this form that expresses the solubility of a solid that forms ions in 
water is a solubility product  and is designated Ksp. In the simplest cases, a solubility product can be 
used alone to calculate the solubility of a slightly soluble salt in water. The solubility ( S, mol/L) of 
barium sulfate is calculated as follows:
 [Ba2+] = [SO42-] = S (5.10)
 [Ba2+][SO42-] = S ¥ S = Ksp = 1.23 ¥ 10-10 (5.11)
 S  = (Ksp)1/2 = (1.23 ¥ 10-10)1/2 = 1.11 ¥ 10-5 (5.12)
Even such a simple calculation may be complicated by variations in activity coeffi  cients resulting 
from differences in ionic strength.
Intrinsic solubilities  account for the fact that a signifi  cant portion of the solubility of an ionic 
solid is due to the dissolution of the neutral form of the salt and must be added to the solubility Phase Interactions in Aquatic Chemistry 107
 calculated from Ksp to obtain the total solubility, as illustrated below for the calculation of the solu-
bility of calcium sulfate. When calcium sulfate dissolves in water that does not have any other 
sources of calcium or sulfate ions, the two major reactions are

44 CaSO ( ) Ca SO s  (5.15)
 [Ca2+][SO42-] = Ksp = 2.6 ¥ 10-5 (25∞C) (5.16)
and the total solubility of CaSO4 is calculated as follows:

 (5.18)
It is seen that, in this case, the intrinsic solubility accounts for half of the solubility of the salt.
In Section 3.15, it was seen that solubilities of ionic solids can be very much affected by reactions 
of cations and anions. It was shown that the solubility of PbCO3 is increased by the chelation of lead 
ion by NTA,
 +- -+ /arrowpairrightleft23Pb T PbT (3.72)
increased by reaction of carbonate ion with H+,

and decreased by the presence of carbonate ion from water alkalinity: 
 -- ++ /arrowpairrightleft22
33 3CO (from dissociation of HCO ) Pb PbCO ( ) s (5.20)
These examples illustrate that reactions of both cations and anions must often be considered in 
calculating the solubilities of ionic solids.
5.3.2  SOLUBILITIES  OF GASES
The solubilities of gases in water are described by Henry’s law, which states that at constant 
 temperature the solubility of a gas in a liquid is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas in 
contact with the liquid . For a gas, “X,” this law applies to equilibria of the type
 /arrowpairrightleft X( ) X( )ga q  (5.21)
and does not account for additional reactions of the gas species in water such as
 -++ /arrowpairrightleft+
32 4NH H O NH OH  (5.22)
 --++ /arrowpairrightleft23 2 3SO HCO (from water alkalinity) CO HSO  (5.23)108 Environmental Chemistry
which may result in much higher solubilities than predicted by Henry’s law alone. Mathematically, 
Henry’s law is expressed as
 [X( aq)] = KPX (5.24)
where [X( aq)] is the aqueous concentration of the gas, PX is the partial pressure of the gas, and K is the 
Henry’s law constant applicable to a particular gas at a specifi  ed temperature. For gas concentrations 
in units of moles per liter and gas pressures in atmospheres, the units of K are moles per liter per atmo-
sphere. Some values of K for dissolved gases that are signifi  cant in water are given in Table 5.1.
In calculating the solubility of a gas in water, a correction must be made for the partial pressure 
of water by subtracting it from the total pressure of the gas. At 25 ∞C, the partial pressure of water 
i s  0 . 0 3 1 3  a tm ;  v al u e s  a t  o th e r  te m pe ra tur e s  ar e  r e adil y  o b tain ed  fr o m  s tan dar d  h an d boo ks .  Th e  
 concentration of oxygen in water saturated with air at 1.00 atm and 25 ∞C may be calculated as an 
example of a simple gas solubility calculation. Considering that dry air is 20.95% by volume  oxygen, 
factoring in the partial pressure of water gives the following:
 =-¥ =
2O(1.0000 atm 0.0313 atm) 0.2095 0.2029 atm P  (5.25)

2O[O ( )] 1.28 10 mol / L / atm 0.2029 atm 2.60 10 mol/L aq K P  (5.26)
The molecular mass of oxygen is 32, so the concentration of dissolved O2 in water in equilibrium 
with air under the conditions given above is 8.32 mg/L or 8.32 parts per million (ppm).
The solubilities of gases decrease with increasing temperature. Account is taken of this factor 
with the Clausius–Clapeyron  equation,
 D È˘=-Í˙Î˚2
11 211log2.303C H
CR T T (5.27)
where C1 and C2 denote the gas concentration in water at absolute temperatures of T1 and T2, respec-
tively; DH is the heat of the solution; and R is the gas constant. The value of R is 1.987 cal/deg/mol, 
which gives DH in units of cal/mol.
5.4 COLLOIDAL PARTICLES IN WATER
Many minerals, some organic pollutants, proteinaceous materials, some algae, and some bacteria 
are suspended in water as very small particles. Such particles, which have some characteristics of 
both species in solution and larger particles in suspension, which range in diameter from about 
0.001 micrometer ( mm) to about 1 mm, and which scatter white light as a light blue hue observed at TABLE 5.1

right angles to the incident light, are classifi  ed as colloidal particles . The characteristic light- 
scattering phenomenon of colloids results from their being the same order of size as the wavelength 
of light and is called the Tyndall effect . The unique properties and behavior of colloidal particles are 
strongly infl  uenced by their physical–chemical characteristics, including high specifi  c area, high 
interfacial energy, and high surface/charge density ratio. Colloids play a very important role in 
determining the properties and behavior of natural waters and wastewaters.
5.4.1 C ONTAMINANT  TRANSPORT  BY COLLOIDS  IN WATER
An important infl  uence of colloids in aquatic chemistry is their ability to transport various kinds of 
organic and inorganic contaminants. Colloid-facilitated transport  in which contaminants bound to the 
surface of colloidal particles can be an important means of moving substances that would otherwise 
be sorbed to sediments or, in the case of groundwater transport, to aquifer rocks. This mechanism is 
of concern with respect to circumvention of natural and artifi  cial barriers in the long-term subsurface 
disposal of some kinds of wastes, such as high-level nuclear wastes including plutonium.2
5.4.2  OCCURRENCE  OF COLLOIDS  IN WATER
Colloids composed of a variety of organic substances (including humic substances), inorganic mate-
rials (especially clays), and pollutants occur in natural water and wastewater. These substances have 
a number of effects, including those on organisms and pollutant transport. The characterization of 
colloidal materials in water is obviously very important, and a variety of means are used to isolate 
and characterize those materials. The two most widely used methods are fi  ltration and centrifuga-
tion, although other techniques including voltammetry and fi  eld-fl  ow fractionation can be used.
5.4.3  KINDS OF COLLOIDAL  PARTICLES
Colloids may be classifi  ed as hydrophilic colloids , hydrophobic colloids , or association colloids . 
These three classes are briefl  y summarized below.
Hydrophilic colloids  generally consist of macromolecules, such as proteins and synthetic poly-
mers that are characterized by strong interaction with water resulting in spontaneous formation of 
colloids when they are placed in water. In a sense, hydrophilic colloids are solutions of very large 
molecules or ions. Suspensions of hydrophilic colloids are less affected by the addition of salts to 
water than are suspensions of hydrophobic colloids.
Hydrophobic colloids  interact to a lesser extent with water and are stable because of their  positive 
or negative electrical charges as shown in Figure 5.3. The charged surface of the colloidal particle 
and the counterions  that surround it compose an electrical double layer , which causes the particles 
to repel each other. 
Hydrophobic colloids are usually caused to settle from suspension by the addition of salts. Examples 
of hydrophobic colloids are clay particles, petroleum droplets, and very small gold particles.
Association colloids  consist of special aggregates of ions and molecules called micelles . To 
understand how this occurs, consider sodium stearate, a typical soap with the structural formula 
shown below:
 CC C C C C C C C C C C C C C C CO -CH
H HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHO
Na+
Represented as Na+-
The stearate ion has both a hydrophilic -CO2- head and a long organophilic tail, CH3(CH2)16– . As a 
result, stearate anions in water tend to form clusters consisting of as many as 100 anions clustered 110 Environmental Chemistry
together with their hydrocarbon “tails” on the inside of a spherical colloidal particle and their ionic 
“heads” on the surface in contact with water and with Na+ counter-ions. Such micelles  (Figure 5.4) 
can be visualized as droplets of oil about 3–4 nanometers (nm) in diameter and covered with ions 
or polar groups. According to this model, micelles form when a certain concentration of surfactant 
species, typically around 1  ¥ 10-3 M, is reached. The concentration at which this occurs is called the 
critical micelle concentration .
5.4.4  COLLOID  STABILITY
The stability of colloids is a prime consideration in determining their behavior. It is involved in impor-
tant aquatic chemical phenomena including the formation of sediments, dispersion and agglomeration 
of bacterial cells, and dispersion and removal of pollutants (such as crude oil from an oil spill).+++

As discussed above, the two main phenomena contributing to the stabilization of colloids 
are hydration  and surface charge . The layer of water on the surface of hydrated colloidal parti-
cles prevents contact, which would result in the formation of larger units. A surface charge 
on  colloidal particles may prevent aggregation, since like-charged particles repel each 
other. The surface charge is frequently pH dependent; at around pH 7, most colloidal particles in 
 natural waters are negatively charged. Negatively charged aquatic colloids include algal cells, 
bacterial cells,  proteins, and colloidal  petroleum droplets. Natural organic matter in water 
tends to bind with colloidal particle surfaces and, because of the negatively charged func-
tional groups  characteristic of this matter, gives colloidal particles in water a predominantly 
negative charge.
One of the three major ways in which a particle may acquire a surface charge is by chemical 
reaction at the particle surface . This phenomenon, which frequently involves hydrogen ion and is 
pH dependent, is typical of hydroxides and oxides and is illustrated for manganese dioxide, MnO2, 
in Figure 5.5.
As an illustration of pH-dependent charge on colloidal particle surfaces, consider the effects of 
pH on the surface charge of hydrated manganese oxide, represented by the chemical formula 
MnO2(H2O)(s). In a relatively acidic medium, the reaction
 MnO2(H2O)(s) + H+ Æ MnO2(H3O)+(s) (5.28)
may occur on the surface giving the particle a net positive charge. In a more basic medium, hydro-
gen ions may be lost from the hydrated oxide surface to yield negatively charged particles:
 MnO2(H2O)(s) Æ MnO2(OH)-(s) + H+ (5.29)
At some intermediate pH value, called the zero point of charge  (ZPC), colloidal particles of a 
given hydroxide will have a net charge of zero, which favors aggregation of particles and precipita-
tion of a bulk solid:
 Number of MnO2(H3O)+ sites = Number of MnO2(OH)- sites (5.30)
Individual cells of microorganisms that behave as colloidal particles have a charge that is pH 
dependent. The charge is acquired through the loss and gain of H+ ions by carbo xy l and amino 
groups on the cell surface:

Ion absorption  is a second way in which colloidal particles become charged. This 
 phenomenon involves attachment of ions onto the colloidal particle surface by means other than 
conventional covalent bonding, including hydrogen bonding and London (van der Waal) 
interactions.
Ion replacement  is a third way in which a colloidal particle may gain a net charge; for example, 
replacement of some of the Si(IV) with Al(III) in the basic SiO2 chemical unit in the crystalline 
lattice of some clay minerals as shown in Equation 5.31,
 [SiO2] + Al(III) Æ [AlO2-] + Si(IV) (5.31)
yields sites with a net negative charge. Similarly, replacement of Al(III) by a divalent metal ion such 
as Mg(II) in the clay crystalline lattice produces a net negative charge.112 Environmental Chemistry
5.5 COLLOIDAL PROPERTIES OF CLAYS
Clays constitute the most important class of common minerals occurring as colloidal matter in 
water. The composition and properties of clays are discussed in some detail in Section 15.7 (as solid 
terrestrial minerals) and are briefl  y summarized here. Clays  consist largely of hydrated aluminum 
and silicon oxides and are secondary minerals , which are formed by weathering and other  processes Mn Mn

acting on primary rocks (see Sections 15.2 and 15.8). The general formulas of some common clays 
are given below:
Kaolinite: Al• 2(OH)4Si2O5
Montmorillonite: Al• 2(OH)2Si4O10
Nontronite: Fe• 2(OH)2Si4O10
Hydrous mica: KAl• 2(OH)2(AlSi3)O10
The most common clay minerals are illites, montmorillonites, chlorites, and kaolinites. These clay 
minerals are distinguished from each other by general chemical formula, structure, and chemical 
and physical properties. Iron and manganese are commonly associated with clay minerals.
Clays are characterized by layered structures consisting of sheets of silicon oxide alternating 
with sheets of aluminum oxide. Units of two or three sheets make up unit layers . Some clays, par-
ticularly the montmorillonites, may absorb large quantities of water between unit layers, a process 
accompanied by swelling of the clay.
As described in Section 5.4, clay minerals may attain a net negative charge by ion replacement, 
in which Si(IV) and Al(III) ions are replaced by metal ions of similar size but lesser charge. This 
negative charge must be compensated for by association of cations with the clay layer surfaces. 
Since these cations need not fi  t specifi  c sites in the crystalline lattice of the clay, they may be rela-
tively large ions, such as K+, Na+, or NH4+. These cations are called exchangeable cations  and are 
exchangeable for other cations in water. The amount of exchangeable cations, expressed as 
 milliequivalents (of monovalent  cations) per 100 g of dry clay, is called the cation-exchange capac-
ity (CEC) of the clay and is a very important characteristic of colloids and sediments that have cat-
ion-exchange capabilities.
Because of their structure and high surface area per unit mass, clays have a strong tendency to 
sorb chemical species from water. Thus, clays play a role in the transport and reactions of biological 
wastes, organic chemicals, gases, and other pollutant species in water. However, clay minerals may 
also effectively immobilize dissolved chemicals in water and so exert a purifying action. Some 
microbial processes occur at clay particle surfaces and, in some cases, sorption of organics by clay 
inhibits biodegradation. Thus, clay may play a role in the microbial degradation or nondegradation 
of organic wastes.
5.6 AGGREGATION OF PARTICLES
The processes by which particles aggregate and precipitate from colloidal suspension are quite 
important in the aquatic environment. For example, the settling of biomass during biological waste 
treatment depends upon the aggregation of bacterial cells. Other processes involving the aggrega-
tion of colloidal particles are the formation of bottom sediments and the clarifi  cation of turbid water 
for domestic or industrial use. Particle aggregation is complicated and may be divided into the two 
general classes of coagulation and fl o c c u l a t i o n . These are discussed below.
Colloidal particles are prevented from aggregating by the electrostatic repulsion of the electrical 
double layers (adsorbed-ion layer and counter-ion layer). Coagulation  involves the reduction of this 
electrostatic repulsion such that colloidal particles of identical materials may aggregate. Flocculation  
uses bridging compounds , which form chemically bonded links between colloidal particles and 
enmesh the particles in relatively large masses called fl o c  n e t w o r k s .
Hydrophobic colloids are often readily coagulated by the addition of small quantities of salts 
that contribute ions to solution. Such colloids are stabilized by electrostatic repulsion. Therefore, 
the simple explanation of coagulation by ions in solution is that the ions reduce the electrostatic 
repulsion between particles to such an extent that the particles aggregate. Because of the double 
layer of electrical charge surrounding a charged particle, this aggregation mechanism is sometimes 
called double-layer compression . It is particularly noticeable in estuaries where sediment-laden 114 Environmental Chemistry
fresh water fl  ows into the sea, and is largely responsible for deltas formed where large rivers enter 
oceans.
The binding of positive ions to the surface of an initially negatively charged colloid can result in 
precipitation followed by colloid restabilization as shown in Figure 5.6. This kind of behavior is 
explained by an initial neutralization of the negative surface charge on the particles by sorption of 
positive ions, allowing coagulation to occur. As more of the source of positive ions is added, their 
sorption results in the formation of positive colloidal particles.
5.6.1  FLOCCULATION  OF COLLOIDS  BY POLYELECTROLYTES
Polyelectrolytes  of both natural and synthetic origin may cause colloids to fl  occulate. Polyelectrolytes 
are polymers with a high formula mass that normally contain ionizable functional groups. Typical 
examples of synthetic polyelectrolytes are shown in Table 5.2.
It can be seen from Table 5.2 that anionic polyelectrolytes have negatively charged functional 
groups such as -SO3- and -CO2-. Cationic polyelectrolytes have positively charged functional groups, 
normally H+ bonded to N. Nonionic polymers that serve as fl  occulants normally do not have charged 
functional groups.
Somewhat paradoxically, anionic polyelectrolytes may fl  occulate negatively charged colloidal 
particles, a process that is particularly important in biological systems, for example, in the cohesion 
of tissue cells, clumping of bacterial cells, and antibody–antigen reactions. The mechanism by 
which this occurs involves bridging between the colloidal particles by way of the polyelectrolyte 
anions. It is facilitated by the presence of a low concentration of a metal ion capable of serving as a 
bridge between the negatively charged anionic polyelectrolytes and negatively charged functional 
groups on the colloidal particle surface.
5.6.2  FLOCCULATION  OF BACTERIA  BY POLYMERIC  MATERIALS
The aggregation and settling of microorganism cells is a very important process in aquatic systems 
and is essential to the function of biological waste treatment systems. In these processes, using  bacteria 
to degrade organic wastes, a signifi  cant fraction of the carbon in the waste is removed as bacterial fl  oc , 
consisting of aggregated bacterial cells that have settled from the water. The  formation of this fl  oc is 
obviously an important phenomenon in biological waste treatment. Poly meric substances, including 
polyelectrolytes, that are formed by the bacteria induce bacterial fl  occulation.
Within the pH range of normal natural waters (pH 5–9), bacterial cells are negatively charged. 
The ZPC of most bacteria is within the pH range 2–3. However, even at the ZPC, stable bacterial 
suspensions may exist. Therefore, surface charge is not necessarily required to maintain bacterial 
cells in suspension in water, and it is likely that bacterial cells remain in suspension because of the 
hydrophilic character of their surfaces. As a consequence, some sort of chemical interaction involv-
ing bridging species must be involved in bacterial fl  occulation.–

by restabilization as a positively charged colloid.Phase Interactions in Aquatic Chemistry 115
5.7 SURFACE SORPTION BY SOLIDS
Many of the properties and effects of solids in contact with water have to do with the sorption of 
solutes by solid surfaces. Surfaces in fi  nely divided solids tend to have excess surface energy because 
of an imbalance of chemical forces among surface atoms, ions, and molecules. Surface energy level 
may be lowered by a reduction in surface area. Normally this reduction is accomplished by aggrega-
tion of particles or by sorption of solute species.
Some kinds of surface interactions can be illustrated with metal oxide surfaces binding with 
metal ions in water. (Such a surface, its reaction with water, and its subsequent acquisition of a 
charge by loss or gain of H+ ion were shown in Figure 5.5 for MnO2.) Other inorganic solids, such 
as clays, probably behave much like solid metal oxides. Soluble metal ions, such as Cd2+, Cu2+, Pb2+, 
or Zn2+, may be bound with metal oxides such as MnO2 ◊ xH2O by nonspecifi  c ion-exchange adsorp-
tion, complexation with surface -OH groups, coprecipitation in solid solution with the metal oxide, 
or as a discrete oxide or hydroxide of the sorbed metal. Sorption of metal ions, Mtz+, by complex-
ation to the surface is illustrated by the reaction

Some hydrated metal oxides, such as manganese(IV) oxide and iron(III) oxide, are especially 
effective in sorbing various species from aquatic solution. The sorption ability is especially pro-
nounced for relatively fresh metal hydroxides or hydrated oxides such as colloidal MnO2. This oxide 
usually is produced in natural waters by the oxidation of Mn(II) present in natural waters placed 
there by the bacterially mediated reduction of manganese oxides in anoxic bottom sediments. 
Colloidal hydrated manganese(II) oxide can also be produced by the reduction of manganese(VII), 
which can be deliberately added to water as an oxidant in the form of permanganate salts to dimin-
ish taste and odor or to oxidize iron(II).
Freshly precipitated MnO2 may have a surface area as large as several hundred square meters per 
gram. The hydrated oxide acquires a charge by loss and gain of H+ ion and has a ZPC in an acidic 
pH range between 2.8 and 4.5. Since the pH of most normal natural waters exceeds 4.5, hydrous 
MnO2 colloids are usually negatively charged.

The degree of anion sorption varies. As with phosphate, sulfate may be sorbed by chemical  bonding, 
usually at a pH < 7. Chloride and nitrate are sorbed by electrostatic attraction, such as occurs with 
positively charged colloidal particles in soil at a low pH. More specifi  c bonding mechanisms may be 
involved in the sorption of fl  uoride, molybdate, selenate, selenite, arsenate, and arsenite anions.
5.8 SOLUTE EXCHANGE WITH BOTTOM SEDIMENTS
Bottom sediments are important sources and sinks of inorganic and organic matter in streams, 
freshwater impoundments, estuaries, and oceans. It is incorrect to consider bottom sediments  simply 
as wet soil. Normal soils are in contact with the atmosphere and are oxic, whereas the environment Phase Interactions in Aquatic Chemistry 117
around bottom sediments is usually anoxic, so sediments are subjected to reducing conditions. 
Bottom sediments undergo continuous leaching, whereas soils do not. The level of organic matter 
in sediments is generally higher than that in soils.
One of the most important characteristics of bottom sediments is their ability to exchange cations 
with the surrounding aquatic medium. CEC measures the capacity of a solid, such as a sediment, to 
sorb cations. It varies with pH and salt concentration. Another parameter, exchangeable cation 
 status  (ECS), refers to the amounts of specifi  c ions bonded to a given amount of sediment. Generally, 
both CEC and ECS are expressed as milliequivalents per 100 g of solid.
Because of the generally anoxic nature of bottom sediments, special care must be exercised in 
their collection and treatment. Particularly, contact with atmospheric oxygen rapidly oxidizes 
exchangeable Fe2+ and Mn2+ to nonexchangeable oxides containing the metals in higher oxidation 
states as Fe2O3 and MnO2. Therefore, sediment samples must be sealed and frozen as soon as pos-
sible after they are collected.
A common method for the determination of CEC consists of (1) treating the sediment with a 
solution of an ammonium salt so that all exchangeable sites are occupied by NH4+ ion; (2) displacing 
the ammonium ion with a solution of NaCl; and (3) determining the quantity of displaced ammo-
nium ion. The CEC values may then be expressed as the number of milliequivalents of ammonium 
ion exchanged per 100 g of dried sample. Note that the sample must be dried after exchange.
The basic method for the determination of ECS consists of stripping all of the exchangeable metal 
cations from the sediment sample with ammonium acetate. Metal cations, including Fe2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, 
Cu2+, Ni2+, Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+, are then determined in the leachate. Exchangeable hydrogen ion 
is very diffi  cult to determine by direct methods. It is generally assumed that the total CEC minus the 
sum of all exchangeable cations except hydrogen ion is equal to the exchangeable hydrogen ion.
Freshwater sediments typically have CEC values of 20–30 milliequivalents/100 g. The ECS 
 values for individual cations typically range from <1 to 10–20 milliequivalents/100 g. Sediments 
are important repositories of metal ions that may be exchanged with surrounding waters. Further-
more, because of their capacity to sorb and release hydrogen ions, sediments have an important 
pH- buffering effect in some waters.
5.8.1 T RACE-LEVEL METALS IN SUSPENDED  MATTER AND SEDIMENTS
Sediments and suspended particles are important repositories for trace amounts of metals such as chro-
mium, cadmium, copper, molybdenum, nickel, cobalt, and manganese. These metals may be present 
as discrete compounds, i ons he l d b y cati on-e x chan gin g c la y s, bound to h y drated o xi des o f iron or 
manganese, or chelated by insoluble humic substances. The form of the metals depends upon p E. 
Examples of specifi  c trace-metal-containing compounds that may be stable in natural waters under 
oxidizing and reducing conditions are given in Table 5.3. Solubilization of metals from sedimentary or 
suspended matter is often a function of the complexing agents present. These include amino acids, 
such as histidine, tyrosine, or cysteine; citrate ion; and, in the presence of  seawater, chloride ion. 
Suspended particles containing trace elements may be in the submicrometer size range. Although less 
available than metals in true solution, metals held by very small particles are more accessible than 
those in sediments. Among the factors involved in metal availability are the identity of the metal, its 
chemical form (type of binding, oxidation state), the nature of the suspended material, the type of 
organism taking up the metal, and the physical and chemical conditions in the water. The pattern of 
trace-metal occurrence in suspended matter in relatively unpolluted water tends to correlate well with 
that of the parent minerals from which the suspended solids originated; anomalies appear in polluted 
waters where industrial sources add to the metal content of the stream.
Two inorganic species are particularly important in the sequestration of heavy metals in  sediments. 
One of these is hydrated iron(III) oxide, commonly represented as Fe2O3 ◊ x(H2O), Fe(OH)3, or FeOOH, 
which coprecipitates heavy metals. This material forms when soluble iron(II) is exposed to oxidizing 
conditions. Under anoxic conditions the material is reduced to soluble iron(II) (Reaction 5.6), which 118 Environmental Chemistry
releases bound heavy metals. The second important solid that binds heavy metals consists of acid-
volatile sulfi  des , especially FeS. Most heavy metals have a stronger affi  nity for sulfi  de than does 
iron(II), so heavy metals tend to displace Fe(II) from this compound. The conditions conducive to 
reduction of hydrated iron(III) oxide leading to release of sequestered heavy metal ions are also con-
ducive to formation of FeS, which may release sulfi  de to bind such ions in an insoluble form.
The toxicities of heavy metals in sediments and their availability to organisms are very important in 
determining the environmental effects of heavy metals in aquatic systems. Many sediments are anoxic, 
so that microbial reduction of sulfate to sulfi  de leads to a preponderance of metal sulfi  des in sediments. 
The very low solubilities of sulfi  des tend to limit bioavailability of metals in anoxic sediments. However, 
exposure of such sediments to air, and subsequent oxidation of sulfi  de to sulfate, can release signifi  cant 
amounts of heavy metals. Dredging operations can expose anoxic sediments to air, leading to oxidation 
of sulfi  des and release of metals such as lead, mercury,  cadmium, zinc, and copper.
5.8.2 P HOSPHORUS  EXCHANGE  WITH BOTTOM  SEDIMENTS
Phosphorus is one of the key elements in aquatic chemistry and is the limiting nutrient in the growth 
of algae under many conditions. Exchange with sediments plays a role in making phosphorus 
 available for algae and contributes, therefore, to eutrophication. Sedimentary phosphorus may be 
classifi  ed into the following types:
Phosphate minerals• , particularly hydroxyapatite, Ca5OH(PO4)3.
Nonoccluded phosphorus• , such as orthophosphate ion bound to the surface of SiO2 or 
CaCO3. Such phosphorus is generally more soluble and more available than occluded phos-
phorus (below).
Occluded phosphorus•  consisting of orthophosphate ions contained within the matrix 
structures of amorphous hydrated oxides of iron and aluminum and amorphous alumino-
silicates. Such phosphorus is not as readily available as nonoccluded phosphorus.
Organic phosphorus•  incorporated within aquatic biomass, usually of algal or bacterial 
origin.
In some waters receiving heavy loads of domestic or industrial wastes, inorganic polyphosphates 
(e.g., from detergents) may be present in sediments. Runoff from fi  elds where liquid polyphosphate 
fertilizers have been used can result in polyphosphates sorbed on sediments. The action of micro-
organisms on phosphate minerals, especially iron phosphates, can release phosphate to water.3TABLE 5.3

5.8.3  ORGANIC  COMPOUNDS  ON SEDIMENTS  AND SUSPENDED  MATTER
Many organic compounds interact with suspended material and sediments in bodies of water. 
Colloids can play a signifi  cant role in the transport of organic pollutants in surface waters, through 
treatment processes, and even, to a limited extent, in groundwater. Settling of suspended material 
containing sorbed organic matter carries organic compounds into the sediment of a stream or lake. 
For example, this phenomenon is largely responsible for the presence of herbicides in sediments 
containing contaminated soil particles eroded from cropland. Some organics are carried into sedi-
ments by the remains of organisms or by fecal pellets from zooplankton that have accumulated 
organic contaminants.
Suspended particulate matter affects the mobility of organic compounds sorbed to particles. 
Furthermore, sorbed organic matter undergoes chemical degradation and biodegradation at differ-
ent rates and by different pathways compared to organic matter in solution. There is, of course, a 
vast variety of organic compounds that get into water and they react with sediments in different 
ways, the type and strength of binding varying with the type of compound.
The most common types of sediments considered for their organic binding abilities are clays, 
organic (humic) substances, and complexes between clay and humic substances. Both clays and 
humic substances act as cation exchangers. Therefore, these materials sorb cationic organic com-
pounds through ion exchange. This is a relatively strong sorption mechanism, greatly reducing the 
mobility and biological activity of the organic compound. When sorbed by clays, cationic organic 
compounds are generally held between the layers of the clay mineral structure where their biologi-
cal activity is essentially zero.
Since most sediments lack strong anion-exchange sites, negatively charged organics are not held 
strongly at all. Thus, these compounds are relatively mobile and biodegradable in water despite the 
presence of solids.
The degree of sorption of organic compounds is generally inversely proportional to their water 
solubility. The more water-insoluble compounds tend to be taken up strongly by lipophilic (“fat-
loving”) solid materials, such as humic substances (see Section 3.17). Compounds having a rela-
ti v e l y hi gh v apor pressure can be l os t from w ater or so li ds b y e v aporati on. When this happens, 
photochemical processes (see Chapter 9) can play an important role in their degradation.
The herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) has been studied extensively in regard to 
sorption reactions. Most of these studies have dealt with pure clay minerals, however, whereas soils and 
sediments are likely to have a strong clay–fulvic acid complex component. The sorption of 2,4-D by 
such a complex can be described using an equation of the Freundlich isotherm type
 X  = KCn (5.37)
where X is the amount sorbed per unit weight of solid, C is the concentration of 2,4-D in water solu-
tion at equilibrium, and n and K are constants. These values are determined by plotting log X versus 
log C. If a Freundlich-type equation is obeyed, the plot will be linear with a slope of n and an inter-
cept of log K.
Sorption of comparatively nonvolatile hydrocarbons by sediments not only removes these mate-
rials from contact with aquatic organisms but also greatly retards their biodegradation. Aquatic 
plants produce some of the hydrocarbons that are found in sediments. Photosynthetic organisms, for 
example, produce quantities of n-heptadecane. The distribution of hydrocarbon types in sediments 
can be used to distinguish natural from pollutant sources. 
The sorption of neutral species like petroleum obviously cannot be explained by ion-exchange 
processes. It probably involves phenomena such as van der Waal’s forces (a term sometimes invoked 
when the true nature of an attractive force is not understood, but generally regarded as consisting of 
induced dipole–dipole interaction involving a neutral molecule), hydrogen bonding, charge-transfer 
complexation, and hydrophobic interactions.120 Environmental Chemistry
In some cases, pollutant compounds become covalently bounded as bound residues  to humic 
substances in sediments and soil. Among the kinds of organic compounds for which there is evi-
dence of bound residues in sediments are pesticides and their metabolites, plasticizers, halogenated 
aromatic compounds, and nitro compounds.4 It is very diffi  cult to remove such residues from humic

formation of bound residues by persistent organic pollutants during humifi  cation of organic matter 
is an immobilization and detoxifi  cation process that is signifi  cant compared with biodegradation 
and mineralization in effectively removing such pollutants from the environment. The binding is 
thought to occur through the action of enzymes from some organisms. These enzymes are extracel-
lular enzymes (those acting outside the cell) that act as oxidoreductases, which catalyze oxidation–
reduction reactions. Microbial phenoloxidase enzymes act upon aromatic substrates from lignin 
decomposition, which are present in humic substances produced from lignin precursors, and also 
act upon aromatic xenobiotic aromatic compounds, such as anilines and phenols. This can result in 
the binding of xenobiotic aromatic compounds with humic substances as illustrated below for the 
coupling of the pollutant 2,4-dichlorophenol to an aryl ring on a humic substance molecule:

Obviously, uptake of organic matter by suspended and sedimentary material in water is an 
important phenomenon. This phenomenon signifi  cantly reduces the overall toxicity of pesticides in 
water. Biodegradation is generally slowed down appreciably, however, by binding of a substance to 
a solid. In certain intensively farmed areas, there is a very high accumulation of pesticides in the 
sediments of streams, lakes, and reservoirs. The sorption of pesticides by solids and the resulting 
infl uence on their biodegradation is an important consideration in the licensing of new pesticides.
The transfer of surface water to groundwater often results in sorption of some water contami-
nants by soil and mineral material. To take advantage of this purifi  cation effect, some municipal 
water supplies are drawn from beneath the surface of natural or artifi  cial river banks as a fi  rst step 
in water treatment. The movement of water from waste landfi  lls to aquifers is also an important 
process (see Chapter 20) in which pollutants in the landfi  ll leachate may be sorbed by the solid 
material through which the water passes.
Surfactant alkylphenolpolyethoxylates and their biodegradation product alkylphenols (see 
Section 7.10), which have many industrial and domestic uses, are discharged in signifi  cant quantities 
in wastewater treatment plant effl  uents. These compounds have the potential to disrupt the endo-
crine systems of aquatic organisms and even humans, tend to accumulate in sediments, and may be 
poorly biodegradable under anoxic conditions. Levels of these compounds up to as high as 14 mg/kg 
have been found in sediments in the United States and some fi  sh from the United Kingdom have 
shown tissue levels approaching 1 μg/kg.
5.8.4  BIOAVAILABILITY  OF SEDIMENT  CONTAMINANTS
An important consideration with respect to contaminants in sediments and soils is bioavailability , 
defi ned generally as the degree to which a substance can be absorbed into the system of an organ-
ism. Bioavailability is an especially important consideration in assessing the hazards posed to 
organisms by pollutants in sediments and soils. In some cases, it may be best to not attempt to Phase Interactions in Aquatic Chemistry 121
 remediate these media if the substances of concern have a low bioavailability. In other cases, very 
high bioavailability of toxic substances may make them particularly dangerous.
Figure 5.7 shows the overall process by which a contaminant may get into a microorganism from 
a sediment. A substance bound in a sediment may be released into water, then passed across a bio-
logical membrane into an organism, or it may transfer directly across a membrane from sediment to 
an organism. Once inside the organism, a potentially toxic substance may migrate to a biochemical 
receptor in the organism (see the discussion of receptors in Chapter 23) to exert a toxic effect. These 
processes may actually occur within an organism when contaminated soil or sediment material is 
ingested and traverses the gut wall.
5.9 INTERSTITIAL WATER
Interstitial water  or pore water  consists of water held by sediments. The solutes in interstitial water 
refl ect the chemical and biochemical conditions in the sediments. These solutes include species capa-
ble of undergoing oxidation/reduction, reduced metal ions, nutrients such as NH4+, and soluble organic 
compounds. These species include all of the products expected from the decomposition and minerali-
z a t i o n  o f  p l a n k t o n i c  b i o m a s s ,  l a r g e l y  t h r o u g h  t h e  a c t i v i t y  o f  a n o x i c  b a c t e r i a  i n  t h e  s e d i m e n t s .  
Circulation is strongly curtailed in sediments so that there is a pronounced vertical gradient in the spe-
cies present. At sediment surfaces that may contact water with some oxygen dissolved in it, some more 
oxidized species are encountered, whereas deeper in the sediments reduced species predominate.
Interstitial water is an important reservoir for gases in natural water systems. Generally, the gas 
concentrations in interstitial waters are different from those in the overlying water. Typically, inter-
stitial water at the surface of the sediment contains signifi  cant amounts of N2 and relatively little 
CH4, which requires anoxic conditions for its production and biodegrades in contact with oxygen. 
At depths of around 1 m in sediments, CH4 levels are high and N2 concentrations are low because 
nitrogen is stripped from the interstitial water by microbially produced methane and carbon dioxide, 
which are produced by the anoxic fermentation of organic matter:
 2{CH2O} Æ CH4(g) + CO2(g) (5.39)
The concentrations of argon and nitrogen are much lower at a depth of 1 m than they are at the 
s e d i m e n t  s u r f a c e .  T h i s  fi  nding may be explained by the stripping action of the fermentation- 
produced methane rising to the sediment surface.

5.10 PHASE INTERACTIONS IN CHEMICAL FATE AND TRANSPORT
In Section 1.8, the topic of environmental chemical fate and transport was introduced. The hydro-
sphere is arguably the most important environmental sphere with respect to chemical fate and 
 transport processes, many of which involve distribution of species between phases. It is appropriate 
at this point to consider chemical fate and transport in the hydrosphere. This is an environmentally 
important topic that increasingly utilizes sophisticated mathematical models and calculations that 
are beyond the scope of this book. For more details and example calculations, the reader is referred 
to a comprehensive reference work on the subject.5
5.10.1 R IVERS
The physical movement of chemical species in a river is largely by advection (see Section 1.8) due 
to the gravitational movement of masses of water downstream. This results in relatively rapid  mixing 
and dilution because of velocity shear  in which parcels of water move at different rates in a river 
where water in contact with the banks and bottom moves more slowly than water in the middle of 
the stream. Also contributing to this mixing are turbulent mixing and diffusive transport of dis-
solved species and colloidal particles. The net result of these processes is that a pollutant introduced 
into the river in a relatively concentrated “plug” becomes spread out as it fl  ows downstream.
5.10.2 L AKES AND RESERVOIRS
Lakes and reservoirs are relatively quiet compared with rivers, but there is still movement within such 
bodies of water. Water enters by stream infl  ow, infl  ow from underground springs and aquifers, and 
directly by rainfall. It exits by outfl  ow, such as over a spillway in a reservoir, infi  ltration into ground, 
and evaporation. The balance between input and loss of water in a body of water means that the water 
has a hydraulic residence time . A major factor in mixing processes in lakes is the infl  uence of wind. 
This occurs because windblown surface water moves at a rate that is 2–3% of the wind velocity, a 
phenomenon called wind drift . Water moved toward one side of a lake by wind drift must return some 
distance below the water surface as a return current . In a shallow, unstratifi  ed body of water, the return 
current fl  ows along the bottom where it contacts and may agitate bottom sediments. In stratifi  ed lakes 
(see Figure 3.6) the circulation of water occurs in the upper epilimnion layer as shown in Figure 5.8. 
5.10.3 E XCHANGE  WITH THE ATMOSPHERE
Exchange of chemical species between water and overlying air is an important process. It is the means 
by which atmospheric oxygen enters water to provide oxygen needed by fi  sh. Carbon dioxide required 
for algal growth may come from the air. Air pollutants such as acid gases may enter water from the

atmosphere. Under circumstances of high algal photosynthetic activity, oxygen produced by algae is 
released to the air. Decay of organic matter can oversaturate water with carbon dioxide, requiring its 
release to the air. Anoxic microbial processes in sediments can produce hydrogen sulfi  de and methane 
that are released to air. Volatile organic water pollutants may move from water to the atmosphere.
The air–water interface is the boundary across which species move and is crucial in determining 
the rate of exchange of materials. Current models of these processes assume that there is a thin, 
stationary liquid fi  lm on the surface of the water in direct contact with a thin, stationary layer of air. 
Both of these layers are thin—as little as a few micrometers—and molecular diffusion is the only 
mechanism for movement of solute species in them. Immediately below the thin surface fi  lm of 
water, turbulent diffusion mixes water solutes, and immediately above the thin air fi  lm, turbulent 
 diffusion mixes the species in air.
5.10.4 E XCHANGE  WITH SEDIMENTS
Sediments are very important in chemical fate and transport in the hydrosphere. This is because 
substances, including pollutants such as heavy metals or hydrophobic organics, bind with particles 
as they settle through the water column and are incorporated into sediments. The settling fl  ux den-
sity, J, is equal to the mass of a substance transported across an area through which the settling 
occurs per unit time and is given by the product of the rate at which sedimentary materials settle and 
the concentration of the substance in question in the settling materials:
 J  = (sediment deposition rate) ¥ (substance concentration in particles) (5.40)
Incorporation of pollutants by settling from the water column into sediments is a particularly 
important mode of chemical fate and transport under quiescent conditions during which very small 
(colloidal) particles are aggregating together (fl  occulation). If undisturbed, the layers of sediments can 
provide a record of pollution. A hypothetical, though typical, such plot is shown for lead in Figure 5.9. 
Although sediments are normally repositories of pollutants and reduce their environmental harm, they 
can also provide sources of pollutants that can be mobilized by physical, chemical, or biochemical 
processes. For example, mercury precipitated in sediments can be mobilized as soluble methylmer-
cury species by the action of anoxic bacteria in the oxygen-defi  cient sediments (see Section 7.3).

Biochemistry
6.1 AQUATIC BIOCHEMICAL PROCESSES
Microorganisms— bacteria, fungi, protozoa , and algae —are living catalysts that enable a vast 
number of chemical processes to occur in water and soil. A majority of the important chemical reac-
tions that take place in water, particularly those involving organic matter and oxidation–reduction 
processes, occur through bacterial intermediaries. Algae are the primary producers of biological 
organic matter (biomass) in water. Microorganisms are responsible for the formation of many sedi-
ment and mineral deposits; they also play the dominant role in secondary waste treatment. Some of 
the effects of microorganisms on the chemistry of water in nature are illustrated in Figure 6.1.
Pathogenic microorganisms must be eliminated from water purifi  ed for domestic use. In the past, 
major epidemics of typhoid, cholera, and other water-borne diseases resulted from pathogenic 
microorganisms in water supplies. Even today, constant vigilance is required to ensure that water for 
domestic use is free of pathogens.
Most of this chapter is concerned with aquatic chemical transformations mediated by microorgan-
isms. Although they are not involved in such transformations, special mention should be made of 
viruses in water. Viruses cannot grow by themselves, but reproduce in the cells of host organisms. 
They are only about 1/30–1/20 the size of bacterial cells, and they cause a number of diseases, such as 
polio, viral hepatitis, and perhaps cancer. It is thought that many of these diseases are waterborne.
Because of their small size (0.025–0.100 μm) and biological characteristics, viruses are diffi  cult 
to isolate and culture. They often survive municipal water treatment, including chlorination. Thus, 
although viruses have no effect on the overall environmental chemistry of water, they are an impor-
tant consideration in the treatment and use of water.
Microorganisms are divided into the two broad categories of prokaryotes  and eukaryotes ; the 
latter have well-defi  ned cell nuclei enclosed by a nuclear membrane, whereas the former lack a 
nuclear membrane and the nuclear genetic material is more diffuse in the cell. Other differences 
between these two classes of organisms include location of cell respiration, means of photosynthe-
sis, means of motility, and reproductive processes. All classes of microorganisms produce spores , 
metabolically inactive bodies that form and survive under adverse conditions in a “resting” state 
until conditions favorable for growth occur.
Fungi, protozoa, and bacteria (with the exception of photosynthetic bacteria and protozoa) are clas-
sifi ed as reducers , which break down chemical compounds to more simple species and thereby extract 
the energy needed for their growth and metabolism. Algae are classifi  ed as producers  because they 
utilize light energy and store it as chemical energy. In the absence of sunlight, however, algae utilize 
chemical energy for their metabolic needs. In a sense, therefore, bacteria, protozoa, and fungi may be 
looked upon as environmental catalysts, whereas algae function as aquatic solar fuel cells.
All microorganisms can be put into one of the four following classifi  cations based on the sources 
of energy and carbon that they utilize: chemohet erotrophs, chemoautotrophs, photoheterotrophs, and 
photoautotrophs. These classifi  cations are based on (1) the energy source and (2) the carbon source 
utilized by the organism. Chemotrophs  use chemical energy derived from oxidation–reduction 128 Environmental Chemistry
 reactions of simple inorganic chemical species for their energy needs. Phototrophs  utilize light 
energy from photosynthesis. Heterotrophs obtain their carbon from other organisms; autotrophs  use 
carbon dioxide and ionic carbonates for the C that they require. Figure 6.2 summarizes the classifi  ca-
tions into which microorganisms may be placed with these defi  nitions.
6.1.1 M ICROORGANISMS  AT INTERFACES
Aquatic microorganisms tend to grow at interfaces. Many such microorganisms grow on solids that 
are suspended in water or are present in sediments. Large populations of aquatic bacteria typically 
reside on the surface of water at the air–water interface. In addition to being in contact with air that 
aerobic microorganisms need for their metabolic processes, this interface also accumulates food in 
the form of lipids (oils, fats), polysaccharides, and proteins. Bacteria at this interface are generally

different from those in the body of water and may have a hydrophobic cell character. When surface 
bubbles burst, bacteria at the air–water interface can be incorporated into aerosol water droplets and 
carried by wind. This is a matter of some concern with respect to sewage treatment plants as a 
 possible vector for spreading disease-causing microorganisms.
6.2 ALGAE
For the purposes of discussion here, algae  may be considered as generally microscopic organisms 
that subsist on inorganic nutrients and produce organic matter from carbon dioxide by photosynthe-
sis. In addition to single cells, algae grow as fi  laments, sheets, and colonies. Some algae, particu-
larly the marine kelps, are huge multicellular organisms. The study of algae is called phycology.
The four main classes of unicellular algae of importance in environmental chemistry are the 
following.
Chrysophyta• , which contain pigments that give these organisms a yellow-green or golden-
brown color. Chrysophyta are found in both freshwater and marine systems. They store 
food as carbohydrate or oil. The most well known of these algae are diatoms , characterized 
by silica-containing cell walls. 
Chlorophyta• , commonly known as green algae, are responsible for most of the primary 
productivity in freshwaters.
Pyrrophyta• , commonly known as dinofl  agellates, are motile with structures that enable 
them to move about in water, thus giving them characteristics of protozoa (Section 6.4). 
Pyrrophyta occur in both marine and freshwater environments. “Blooms” of Gymnodinium  
and Gonyaulax  species release toxins that cause harmful “red tides.” 
Euglenophyta•  likewise exhibit characteristics of both plants and animals. Although capa-
ble of photosynthesis, these algae are not exclusively photoautotrophic (see Figure 6.2), and 
they utilize biomass from other sources for at least part of their carbon needs.
The general nutrient requirements of algae are carbon (obtained from CO2 or HCO3−), nitrogen 
(generally as NO3−), phosphorus (as some form of orthophosphate), sulfur (as SO42−), and trace ele-
ments including sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, cobalt, and molybdenum.
In a highly simplifi  ed form, the production of organic matter by algal photosynthesis is described 
by the reaction
 CO2 + H2O + hn Æ {CH2O} + O2(g) (6.1)
where {CH2O} represents a unit of carbohydrate and hn stands for the energy of a quantum of light. 
A reasonably accurate representation of the overall formula of the algae Chlorella  is C5.7H9.8O2.3NP0.06. 
Using this formula for algal biomass exclusive of the phosphorus, the overall reaction for photo-
synthesis is
 5.7CO2 + 3.4H2O + NH3 + hn Æ C5.7H9.8O2.3N + 6.25O2(g) (6.2)
In the absence of light, algae metabolize organic matter in the same manner as do nonphotosyn-
thetic organisms. Thus, algae may satisfy their metabolic demands by utilizing chemical energy 
from the degradation of stored starches or oils, or from the consumption of algal protoplasm itself. 
In the absence of photosynthesis, the metabolic process consumes oxygen, so during the hours of 
darkness an aquatic system with a heavy growth of algae may become depleted in oxygen.
Symbiotic relationships of algae with other organisms are common. There are even reports of 
unicellular green algae growing inside hairs on polar bears, which are hollow for purposes of insu-
lation; the sight of a green polar bear is alleged to have driven more than one Arctic explorer to the 
brink of madness. The most common symbiotic relationship involving algae is that of lichen  in 130 Environmental Chemistry
which algae coexist with fungi; both kinds of organisms are woven into the same thallus (tubular 
vegetative unit). The fungus provides moisture and nutrients required by the algae, which generates 
food photosynthetically. Lichen are involved in weathering processes of rocks (see Section 15.2).
The main role of algae in aquatic systems is the production of biomass. This occurs through 
photosynthesis, which fi  xes carbon dioxide and inorganic carbon from dissolved carbonate species 
as organic matter, thus providing the basis of the food chain for other organisms in the system. The 
production of moderate amounts of biomass is benefi  cial to other organisms in the aquatic system. 
Under some conditions, the growth of algae can produce metabolites that are responsible for odor 
and even toxicity in water.
An interesting aspect of the growth of oceanic plankton including algae is their uptake of micro-
nutrient metals resulting in extremely low concentrations of essential metals in surface seawater. In 
some cases the resultant low availability of nutrient metals limits photosynthetic rates in seawater. 
Some microorganisms in seawater increase bioavailability of nutrient metals and accelerate their 
cycling in water by releasing strong chelating agents and catalyzing oxidation/reduction reactions 
that put nutrient metals in a more soluble and available form.
6.3 FUNGI
Fungi are nonphotosynthetic, often fi  lamentous, organisms exhibiting a wide range of morphology 
(structure). The study of fungi is called mycology . Some fungi are as simple as the microscopic 
unicellular yeasts, whereas other fungi form large, intricate toadstools. The microscopic fi  lamen-
tous structures of fungi generally are much larger than bacteria, and usually are 5–10 μm in width. 
Fungi are aerobic or oxic (oxygen-requiring) organisms and generally can thrive in more acidic 
media than can bacteria. They are also more tolerant of higher concentrations of heavy metal ions 
than are most bacteria.
Perhaps the most important function of fungi in the environment is the breakdown of cellulose 
in wood and other plant materials. To accomplish this, fungal cells secrete an extracellular enzyme 
(exoenzyme), cellulase , that hydrolyzes insoluble cellulose to soluble carbohydrates that can be 
absorbed by the fungal cell. 
Fungi do not grow well in water. However, they play an important role in determining the com-
position of natural waters and wastewaters because of the large amount of their decomposition 
products that enter water. An example of such a product is humic material, which interacts with 
hydrogen ions and metals (see Section 3.17).
6.4 PROTOZOA
Protozoa are microscopic animals consisting of single eukaryotic cells. The numerous kinds of 
protozoa are classifi  ed on the bases of morphology (physical structure), means of locomotion 
 (fl agella, cilia, pseudopodia), presence or absence of chloroplasts, presence or absence of shells, 
ability to form cysts (consisting of a reduced-size cell encapsulated in a relatively thick skin that can 
be carried in the air or by animals in the absence of water), and ability to form spores. Protozoa 
occur in a wide variety of shapes and their movement in the fi  eld of a microscope is especially 
 fascinating to watch. Some protozoa contain chloroplasts and are photosynthetic.
Protozoa play a relatively small role in environmental biochemical processes, but are neverthe-
less signifi  cant in the aquatic and soil environment for the following reasons.
Several devastating human diseases, including malaria, sleeping sickness, and some kinds • 
of dysentery, are caused by protozoa that are parasitic to the human body
Parasitic protozoa can cause debilitating, even fatal, diseases in livestock and wildlife• 
Vast limestone (CaCO• 3) deposits have been formed by the deposition of shells from the 
foramifera  group of protozoaAquatic Microbial Biochemistry 131
Protozoa are active in the oxidation of degradable biomass, particularly in sewage treatment• 
Protozoa may affect bacteria active in degrading biodegradable substances by “grazing” on • 
bacterial cells
Although they are single celled, protozoa have a fascinating variety of structures that enable 
them to function. The protozoal cell membrane is protected and supported by a relatively thick pel-
licle, or by a mineral shell that may act as an exoskeleton. Food is ingested through a structure called 
a cytosome from which it is concentrated in a cytopharynx or oral groove, and then digested by 
enzymatic action in a food vacuole. Residue from food digestion is expelled through a cytopyge and 
soluble metabolic products, such as urea or ammonia, are eliminated by a contractile vacuole, which 
also expels water from the cell interior.
6.5 BACTERIA
Bacteria  are single-celled prokaryotic microorganisms that may be shaped as rods ( bacillus ), 
spheres ( coccus ), or spirals ( vibrios, spirilla, spirochetes ). Bacteria cells may occur individually or 
grow as groups ranging from two to millions of individual cells. Most bacteria fall into the size 
range of 0.5–3.0 μm. However, considering all species, a size range of 0.3–50 μm is observed. 
Characteristics of most bacteria include a semirigid cell wall, motility with fl  agella for those capable 
of movement, unicellular nature (although clusters of cloned bacterial cells are common), and mul-
tiplication by binary fi  ssion in which each of two daughter cells is genetically identical to the parent 
cell. Like other microorganisms, bacteria produce spores.
The metabolic activity of bacteria is greatly infl  uenced by their small size. Their surface- 
to-volume ratio is extremely large, so that the inside of a bacterial cell is highly accessible to a chemi-
cal substance in the surrounding medium. Thus, for the same reason that a fi  nely divided catalyst is 
more effi  cient than a more coarse one, bacteria may bring about very rapid chemical reactions com-
pared to those mediated by larger organisms. Bacteria excrete exoenzymes that break down solid 
food material to soluble components which can penetrate bacterial cell walls, where the digestion 
process is completed.
Although individual bacteria cells cannot be seen by the naked eye, bacterial colonies arising 
from individual cells are readily visible. A common method of counting individual bacterial cells in 
water consists of spreading a measured volume of an appropriately diluted water sample on a plate 
of agar gel containing bacterial nutrients. Wherever a viable bacterial cell adheres to the plate, a 
bacterial colony consisting of many cells will grow. These visible colonies are counted and related 
to the number of cells present initially. Because bacterial cells may already be present in groups, and 
because individual cells may not live to form colonies or even have the ability to form colonies on a 
plate, plate counts tend to underestimate the number of viable bacteria.
6.5.1 A UTOTROPHIC  AND HETEROTROPHIC  BACTERIA
Bacteria may be divided into two main categories, autotrophic and heterotrophic. Autotrophic bac-
teria are not dependent on organic matter for growth and thrive in a completely inorganic medium; 
they use carbon dioxide or other carbonate species as a carbon source. A number of sources of 
energy may be used, depending on the species of bacteria; however, a biologically mediated chem-
ical reaction always supplies the energy.
An example of autotrophic bacteria is Gallionella . In the presence of oxygen, these bacteria are 
grown in a medium consisting of NH4Cl, phosphates, mineral salts, CO2 (as a carbon source), and 
solid FeS (as an energy source). It is believed that the following is the energy-yielding reaction for 
this species:
 4FeS( s) + 9O2 + 10H2O Æ 4Fe(OH)3(s) + 4SO42− + 8H+ (6.3)132 Environmental Chemistry
Starting with the simplest inorganic materials, autotrophic bacteria must synthesize all of the 
complicated proteins, enzymes, and other materials needed for their life processes. It follows, there-
fore, that the biochemistry of autotrophic bacteria is quite sophisticated. Because of their consump-
tion and production of a wide range of minerals, autotrophic bacteria are involved in many 
geochemical transformations.
Heterotrophic bacteria depend on organic compounds, both for energy and for carbon to build 
their biomass. They are much more common in occurrence than autotrophic bacteria. Heterotrophic 
bacteria are the microorganisms primarily responsible for the breakdown of pollutant organic  matter 
in water, and of organic wastes in biological waste-treatment processes.
Some bacteria are capable of photosynthesis to supply their energy and carbon. The most com-
mon such bacteria in water are the cyanobacteria. These organisms were once thought to be algae 
and were called blue-green algae. They can grow prolifi  cally under some conditions and may impart 
such disagreeable tastes and odors to water that they may make it unfi  t for domestic consumption 
during cyanobacteria blooms.
A type of cyanobacteria of unique importance consists of the marine cyanobacteria from the 
Prochlorococcus  genus.1 Only discovered in 1988, these bacteria are the smallest photosynthetic 
organisms known, only about 0.5 μm in size. They are the most abundant photosynthetic organisms 
in the oceans (therefore, on the entire planet), constituting 40–50% of phytoplankton biomass in 
ocean waters in the region between 40° north and 40° south. One of the two major strains of 
Prochlorococcus  lives near the surface where light is abundant, whereas a second strain conducts 
photosynthesis to depths of 200 m reached by only a fraction of 1% of incident light. Despite their 
small cell size, Prochlorococcus  produce a signifi  cant fraction of photosynthetically generated bio-
mass and are very important in marine food chains. Because they fi  x vast quantities of carbon 
dioxide, they have a potentially signifi  cant role in the alleviation of greenhouse warming effects. 
They are noted for their rapid genetic adaptation abilities, which hopefully will enable them to con-
tinue functioning effi  ciently under altered conditions, such as reduced pH in ocean waters, caused 
by elevated carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. 
6.5.2 O XIC AND ANOXIC  BACTERIA
Another classifi  cation system for bacteria depends on their requirement for molecular oxygen. Oxic 
(aerobic bacteria) require oxygen as an electron receptor:
 O2 + 4H+ + 4e− Æ 2H2O (6.4)
Anaerobic bacteria, or anoxic bacteria, function only in the complete absence of molecular oxygen. 
Frequently, molecular oxygen is quite toxic to anoxic bacteria. Anoxic bacteria have gained increas-
ing attention for their ability to degrade organic wastes.
A third class of bacteria, facultative bacteria, utilize free oxygen when it is available and use 
other substances as electron receptors (oxidants) when molecular oxygen is not available. Common 
oxygen substitutes in water are nitrate ion (see Section 6.11) and sulfate ion (see Section 6.12).
6.5.3 M ARINE BACTERIA
Most of the attention that has been given to bacteria in water has been focused on bacteria found in 
freshwater. Recently, more attention has been given to marine bacteria including those in ocean 
sediments. An example of such bacteria is Salinospora , a type of actinomycete bacteria that thrive 
in ocean sediments under dark, cold, high pressure, saline conditions. Known freshwater and ter-
restrial actinomycetes have been the major source of antibiotics such as streptomycin and vanco-
mycin and the possibility of fi  nding new antibiotics and even anticancer drugs in marine actinomycetes 
has generated intense interest in these organisms.Aquatic Microbial Biochemistry 133
6.6 THE PROKARYOTIC BACTERIAL CELL
Figure 6.3 illustrates a generic prokaryotic bacterial cell. Bacterial cells are enclosed in a cell wall , 
which holds the contents of the bacterial cell and determines the shape of the cell. The cell wall in 
many bacteria is frequently surrounded by a slime layer  (capsule). This layer protects the bacteria 
and helps the bacterial cells to adhere to surfaces.
The cell membrane  or cytoplasmic membrane  composed of protein and phospholipid occurs as 
a thin layer only about 7 nm in thickness on the inner surface of the cell wall enclosing the cellular 
cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic membrane is of crucial importance to cell function in that it controls 
the nature and quantity of materials transported into and out of the cell. It is also very susceptible to 
damage from some toxic substances. 
Folds in the cytoplasmic membrane called mesosomes  serve several functions. One of these is to 
increase the surface area of the membrane to enhance transport of materials through it. Another 
function is to act as a site for division of the cell during reproduction. Bacterial DNA is separated at 
the mesosome during cell division.
Hairlike pili on the surface of a bacterial cell enable the cell to stick to surfaces. Specialized sex pili  
enable nucleic acid transfer between bacterial cells during an exchange of genetic material. Somewhat 
similar to pili—but larger, more complex, and fewer in number—are fl a g e l l a , moveable appendages 
that cause bacterial cells to move by their whipping action. Bacteria with fl  agella are termed motile .
Bacterial cells are fi  lled with an aqueous solution and suspension containing proteins, lipids, 
carbohydrates, nucleic acids, ions, and other materials. Collectively, these materials are referred to 
as cytoplasm , the medium in which the cell’s metabolic processes are carried out. The major cell 
bodies suspended in cytoplasm are the following.
Nuclear body•  consisting of a single DNA macromolecule that controls metabolic processes 
and reproduction

sulfur

6.7 KINETICS OF BACTERIAL GROWTH
The population size of bacteria and unicellular algae as a function of time in a growth culture is 
illustrated by Figure 6.4, which shows a population curve for a bacterial culture. Such a culture is 
started by inoculating a rich nutrient medium with a small number of bacterial cells. The population 
curve consists of four regions. The fi  rst region is characterized by little bacterial reproduction and 
is called the lag phase . The lag phase occurs because the bacteria must become acclimated to the 
new medium. Following the lag phase comes a period of very rapid bacterial growth. This is the log 
phase , or exponential phase, during which the population doubles over a regular time interval called 
the generation time . This behavior can be described by a mathematical expression that applies when 
the growth rate is proportional to the number of individuals present and there are no limiting factors 
such as death or lack of food:
 =d
dNkNt  (6.5)
 Êˆ==Á˜Ë¯0
0ln or ekt Nkt N NN (6.6)
where N is the population at time t and N0 is the population at time t = 0. Thus, another way of 
describing population growth during the log phase is to say that the logarithm of bacterial popula-
tion increases linearly with time. The generation time, or doubling time, is (ln 2)/ k, analogous to the 
half-life of radioactive decay. Fast growth during the log phase can cause very rapid microbial trans-
formations of chemical species in water.
The log phase terminates and the stationary phase  begins when a limiting factor is encountered. 
Typical factors limiting growth are depletion of an essential nutrient, buildup of toxic material, and 
exhaustion of oxygen. During the stationary phase, the number of viable cells remains virtually 
constant. After the stationary phase, the bacteria begin to die faster than they reproduce, and the 
population enters the death phase .
6.8 BACTERIAL METABOLISM

duction by mediating chemical reactions. Nature provides a large number of such reactions, and Lag

bacterial species have evolved that utilize many of these. As a consequence of their participation 
in such reactions, bacteria are involved in many biogeochemical processes in water and soil. 
Bacteria are essential participants in many important elemental cycles in nature, including those of 
nitrogen, carbon, and sulfur. They are responsible for the formation of many mineral deposits, 
including some of iron and manganese. On a smaller scale, some of these deposits form through 
bacterial action in natural water systems and even in pipes used to transport water.
Bacterial metabolism addresses the biochemical processes by which chemical species are modi-
fi ed in bacterial cells. It is basically a means of deriving energy and cellular material from nutrient 
substances. Figure 6.5 summarizes the essential features of bacterial metabolism. The two major 
divisions of bacterial metabolism are catabolism, energy-yielding degradative metabolism that 
breaks macromolecules down to their small monomeric constituents, and anabolism, synthetic 
metabolism in which small molecules are assembled into large ones. A key distinction among bac-
teria has to do with the terminal electron acceptor in the electron transport chain involved in the 
process by which bacteria gain energy by oxidizing food materials. If the terminal electron acceptor 
is molecular O2, the process is oxic respiration . If it is another reducible species, commonly includ-
ing SO42−, NO3−, HCO3−, or iron(III), the process is called anoxic respiration . As examples, 
Desulfovibrio  bacteria convert SO42− to H2S, Methanobacterium  reduce HCO3− to CH4, and assorted 
bacteria reduce NO3− to NO2−, N2O, N2, or NH4+.
6.8.1 F ACTORS  AFFECTING  BACTERIAL  METABOLISM
Bacterial metabolic reactions are mediated by enzymes, biochemical catalysts endogenous to living 
organisms that are discussed in detail in Chapter 22. Enzymatic processes in bacteria are essentially 
the same as those in other organisms. At this point, however, it is useful to review several factors 
that infl  uence bacterial enzyme activity and, therefore, bacterial growth.
Figure 6.6 illustrates the effect of substrate concentration  on enzyme activity, where a substrate 
is a substance on which an enzyme acts. It is seen that enzyme activity increases in a linear fashion 
up to a value that represents saturation of the enzyme activity. Beyond this concentration, increasing 
substrate levels do not result in increased enzyme activity. This kind of behavior is refl  ected in bac-
terial activity, which increases with available nutrients up to a saturation value. Superimposed on 
this plot in a bacterial system is increased bacterial population which, in effect, increases the amount 
of available enzyme.
Figure 6.7 shows the effect of temperature  on enzyme activity and on bacterial growth and metab-
olism. Over a relatively short range of temperature in which the bacteria thrive, enzyme activity 
increases with temperature. The curve shows a maximum growth rate with an optimum temperature 
that is skewed toward the high-temperature end of the curve, and exhibits an abrupt drop-off beyond

the temperature maximum. This occurs because enzymes are destroyed by being denatured at tem-
peratures not far above the optimum. Bacteria show different temperature optima. Psychrophilic 
bacteria  are bacteria having temperature optima below approximately 20°C. The temperature optima 
of mesophilic bacteria  lie between 20°C and 45°C. Bacteria having temperature optima above 45°C 
are called thermophilic bacteria . The temperature range for optimum growth of different kinds of 
bacteria is remarkably wide, with some bacteria being able to grow at 0°C, and some thermophilic 
bacteria existing in boiling hot water.
There has been much interest in the adaptation of thermophilic bacteria and their enzymes to 
industrial applications because, as shown by Figure 6. 7 , enzyme activity generally increases with 
increasing temperature.2 An example of such an application is the potential use of a heat-resistant 
catalase enzyme from a thermophilic bacterium isolated from a hot spring pool in Yellowstone 
National Park to catalyze the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide in industrial bleaching wastewaters. 
The application of hydrogen peroxide as a bleaching agent has increased greatly in recent years 
because it is generally regarded as more of a “green chemical” than chlorine and hypochlorite that 
it has been replacing. It is important to break down spent hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water 
before it is discharged, but catalase enzymes from conventional sources are inhibited or destroyed

at the elevated temperatures and pH values typical of the bleaching solutions. However, the catalase 
enzyme from thermophilic bacteria can function well at 70°C and a pH up to 10.
Figure 6.8 is a plot of pH versus bacterial enzyme activity. Although the optimum pH will vary 
somewhat, enzymes typically have a pH optimum around neutrality. Enzymes tend to become dena-
tured at pH extremes. For some bacteria, such as those that generate sulfuric acid by the oxidation 
of sulfi  de or that produce organic acids by fermentation of organic matter, the pH optimum may be 
quite acidic.
6.8.2 M ICROBIAL  OXIDATION  AND REDUCTION
The metabolic processes by which bacteria obtain their energy involve mediation of oxidation– 
reduction reactions. The most environmentally important oxidation–reduction reactions occurring 
in water and soil through the action of bacteria are summarized in Table 6.1. Much of the remainder 
of this chapter is devoted to a discussion of important redox reactions mediated by bacteria, particu-
larly those summarized in Table 6.1.7 10 4

6.9 MICROBIAL TRANSFORMATIONS OF CARBON
Carbon is an essential life element and composes a high percentage of the dry mass of microorganisms. 
For most microorganisms, the bulk of net energy-yielding or energy-consuming metabolic processes 
involve changes in the oxidation state of carbon. These chemical transformations of carbon have 
important environmental implications. For example, when algae and other plants fi  x CO2 as carbo-
hydrate, represented as {CH2O},
 CO2 + H2O + hn Æ {CH2O} + O2(g)  (6.7)
carbon changes from the  +4 to the 0 oxidation state. Energy from sunlight is stored as chemical 
energy in organic compounds. However, when the algae die, bacterial decomposition occurs through 
oxic respiration in the reverse of the biochemical process represented by the above reaction for 
photo synthesis, energy is released, and oxygen is consumed.
In the presence of oxygen, the principal energy-yielding reaction of bacteria is the oxidation of 
organic matter. Since it is generally more meaningful to compare reactions on the basis of the reac-
tion of one electron-mole, the oxic degradation of organic matter is conveniently written as
 +Æ +111 1
22 2 2 444 4{ C HO } O( ) C O HO g (6.8)
for which the free-energy change is −29.9 kcal (see oxic respiration, Table 6.1). From this general 
type of reaction, bacteria and other microorganisms extract the energy needed to carry out their 
metabolic processes, to synthesize new cell material, for reproduction, and for locomotion.
Partial microbial decomposition of organic matter is a major step in the production of peat, lig-
nite, coal, oil shale, and petroleum. Under reducing conditions, particularly below water, the oxygen 
content of the original plant material (approximate empirical formula, {CH2O}) is lowered, leaving 
materials with relatively higher carbon contents.
6.9.1 M ETHANE -FORMING  BACTERIA
The production of methane in anoxic (oxygenless) sediments is favored by high organic levels and 
low nitrate and sulfate levels. Methane production plays a key role in local and global carbon cycles 
as the fi  nal step in the anoxic decomposition of organic matter. This process is the source of about 
80% of the methane entering the atmosphere.
The carbon from microbially produced methane can come from either the reduction of CO2 or 
the fermentation of organic matter, particularly acetate. The anoxic production of methane can be 
represented in the following simplifi  ed manner. When carbon dioxide acts as an electron receptor in 
the absence of oxygen, methane gas is produced:
 +-++ Æ +11 1
24 2 88 4CO H CH H O e (6.9)
This reaction is mediated by methane-forming bacteria. When organic matter is degraded micro-
bially, the half-reaction for one electron-mole of {CH2O} is
 +-+Æ+ +11 1
22 2 44 4{CH O} H O CO H e (6.10)
Adding half-reactions 6.9 and 6.10 yields the overall reaction for the anoxic degradation of 
organic matter by methane-forming bacteria, which involves a free-energy change of −5.55 kcal 
per electron-mole:
 Æ+11 1
24 2 48 8{CH O} CH CO (6.11)140 Environmental Chemistry
This reaction, in reality a series of complicated processes, is a fermentation reaction , defi ned as 
a redox process in which both the oxidizing agent and reducing agent are organic substances. It may 
be seen that only about one-fi  fth as much free energy is obtained from one electron-mole of meth-
ane formation as from a one electron-mole reaction involving complete oxidation of the organic 
matter, Reaction 6.8.
Methane formation is a valuable process responsible for the degradation of large quantities of organic 
wastes, both in biological waste-treatment processes (see Chapter 8) and in nature. Methane production 
is used in biological waste treatment plants to further degrade excess sludge from the activated sludge 
process. In the bottom regions of natural waters, methane-forming bacteria degrade organic matter in 
the absence of oxygen. This eliminates organic matter, which would otherwise require oxygen for its 
biodegradation. If this organic matter were transported to oxic water containing dissolved O2, it would 
exert a BOD. Methane production is a very effi  cient means for the removal of BOD. The reaction
 CH4 + 2O2 Æ CO2 + 2H2O  (6.12)
shows that 1 mol of methane requires 2 mols of oxygen for its oxidation to CO2. Therefore, the pro-
duction of 1 mol of methane and its subsequent evolution from water are equivalent to the removal 
of 2 mols of oxygen demand. In a sense, therefore, the removal of 16 g (1 mol) of methane is equiva-
lent to the addition of 64 g (2 mols) of available oxygen to the water.
In favorable cases, methane fuel can be produced cost-effectively as a renewable resource from 
anoxic digestion of organic wastes. Some installations use cattle feedlot wastes. Methane is rou-
tinely generated by the action of ano xic bacteria and is used f or heat and engine fuel at sewage 
treatment plants (see Chapter 8). Methane produced underground in municipal landfi  lls is being 
tapped by some municipalities; however, methane seeping into basements of buildings constructed 
on landfi  ll containing garbage has caused serious explosions and fi  res.
6.9.2 B ACTERIAL  UTILIZATION  OF HYDROCARBONS
Methane is oxidized under oxic conditions by a number of strains of bacteria. One of these, 
Methanomonas , is a highly specialized organism that cannot use any material other than methane 
as an energy source. Methanol, formaldehyde, and formic acid are intermediates in the microbial 
oxidation of methane to carbon dioxide. As discussed in Section 6.10, several types of bacteria can 
degrade higher hydrocarbons and use them as energy and carbon sources.
6.9.3 M ICROBIAL  UTILIZATION  OF CARBON  MONOXIDE
Carbon monoxide is removed from the atmosphere by contact with soil. Since neither sterilized soil 
nor green plants grown under sterile conditions show any capacity to remove carbon monoxide from 
air, this ability must be because of microorganisms in the soil. Fungi capable of CO metabolism 
include some commonly occurring strains of the ubiquitous Penicillium  and Aspergillus . It is also 
possible that some bacteria are involved in CO removal. However some microorganisms metabolize 
CO, other aquatic and terrestrial organisms produce this gas.
6.10 BIODEGRADATION OF ORGANIC MATTER
The biodegradation of organic matter in the aquatic and terrestrial environments is a crucial envi-
ronmental process. Some organic pollutants are biocidal; for example, effective fungicides must be 
antimicrobial in action. Therefore, in addition to killing harmful fungi, fungicides frequently harm 
benefi  cial saprophytic fungi (fungi that decompose dead organic matter) and bacteria. Herbicides, 
which are designed for plant control, and insecticides, which are used to control insects, generally 
do not have any detrimental effect on microorganisms.Aquatic Microbial Biochemistry 141
The biodegradation of organic matter by microorganisms occurs by way of a number of stepwise, 
microbially catalyzed reactions. These reactions will be discussed individually with examples.
6.10.1 O XIDATION
Oxidation  occurs by the action of oxygenase enzymes (see Chapter 22 for a discussion of biochemi-
cal terms). Epoxidation  is a major step in many oxidation mechanisms and consists of adding an 
oxygen atom between two C atoms in an unsaturated system as shown for benzene below:
 O O2, enzyme-mediated 
Epoxidation
 (6.13)
Epoxidation is a particularly important means of metabolic attack upon aromatic rings that abound 
in many xenobiotic compounds and is part of the process by which potentially carcinogenic PAH 
compounds such as benzo(a)pyrene are biodegraded.3 Epoxidation of an aromatic ring may be fol-
lowed by ring cleavage , an important step in the biodegradation of aromatic compounds:
 O2 CO2H 
O 
Ring cleavage 
Epoxide CO2H 
 (6.14)
6.10.1.1 Microbial Oxidation of Hydrocarbons
The degradation of hydrocarbons by microbial oxidation is an important environmental process 
because it is the primary means by which petroleum wastes are eliminated from water and soil. 
Bacteria capable of degrading hydrocarbons include Micrococcus , Pseudomonas , Mycobacterium , 
and Nocardia .
The most common initial step in the microbial oxidation of alkanes involves conversion of a 
terminal –CH3 group to a –CO2H group. After formation of a carboxylic acid from the alkane, 
 further oxidation normally occurs by b-oxidation: 
 CH3CH2CH2CH2CO2H + 3O2 Æ CH3CH2CO2H + 2CO2 + 2H2O (6.15)
A complicated cycle with a number of steps is involved in b-oxidation. The residue at the end of 
each cycle is an organic acid with two fewer carbon atoms than its precursor at the beginning of 
the cycle.
Hydrocarbons vary signifi  cantly in their biodegradability, and microorganisms show a strong 
preference for straight-chain hydrocarbons. A major reason for this preference is that branching 
inhibits b-oxidation at the site of the branch. The presence of a quaternary carbon (below) particu-
larly inhibits alkane degradation.
CH3 
CH3 
CH3 C C 
The biodegradation of petroleum is essential for the elimination of oil spills (of the order of a 
million metric tons per year). This oil is degraded by both marine bacteria and fi  lamentous fungi. 
In some cases, the rate of degradation is limited by available nitrate and phosphate and it has been 142 Environmental Chemistry
observed that the microbial degradation of hydrocarbons from oil spills is enhanced by providing 
nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium nutrients. The physical form of crude oil makes a large differ-
ence in its degradability. Degradation in water occurs at the water–oil interface and in layers of oil 
fl oating on top of water and exposed to the atmosphere. Therefore, thick layers of crude oil prevent 
contact with bacterial enzymes and O2.
Hydroxylation often accompanies microbial oxidation. It is the attachment of –OH groups to 
hydrocarbon chains or rings. In the biodegradation of foreign compounds, hydroxylation often 
 follows epoxidation as shown by the following rearrangement reaction for benzene epoxide:
OH
HOH
Rearrangement
Hydroxylation can consist of the addition of more than one hydroxide group. An example of epoxi-
dation and hydroxylation is the metabolic production of carcinogenic 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide from 
benzo(a)pyrene discussed in Section 24.4.
6.10.2 O THER BIOCHEMICAL  PROCESSES  IN BIODEGRADATION  OF ORGANICS
Hydrolysis , which involves the addition of H2O to a molecule accompanied by cleavage of the mole-
cule into two products, is a major step in microbial degradation of many pollutant compounds, 
especially pesticidal esters, amides, and organophosphate esters. The types of enzymes that bring 
about hydrolysis are hydrolase enzymes ; those that enable the hydrolysis of esters are called 
esterases , whereas those that hydrolyze amides are amidases . At least one species of Pseudomonas  
hydrolyzes malathion in a type of hydrolysis reaction typical of those by which pesticides are 
degraded:

Reductions  are carried out by reductase enzymes ; for example, nitroreductase enzyme catalyzes 
the reduction of the nitro group. Table 6.2 gives the major kinds of functional groups reduced by 
microorganisms.
Dehalogenation  reactions of organohalide compounds involve the bacterially mediated replace-
ment of a covalently bound halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, I) with –OH, and are discussed in more detail 
in Section 6.13.
Many environmentally signifi  cant organic compounds contain alkyl groups, such as the methyl 
(–CH3) group, attached to atoms of O, N, and S. An important step in the microbial metabolism of 
many of these compounds is dealkylation , replacement of alkyl groups by H as shown in Figure 6.9. 
Examples of these kinds of reactions include O-dealkylation of methoxychlor insecticides, 
N - d e a l k y l a t i o n  o f  c a r b a r y l  i n s e c t i c i d e ,  a n d  S - d e a l k y l a t i o n  o f  d i m e t h y l  s u l fi  de. Alkyl groups 
removed by dealkylation usually are attached to oxygen, sulfur, or nitrogen atoms; those attached to 
carbon are normally not removed directly by microbial processes.Aquatic Microbial Biochemistry 143
6.11 MICROBIAL TRANSFORMATIONS OF NITROGEN
Some of the most important microorganism-mediated chemical reactions in aquatic and soil envi-
ronments are those involving nitrogen compounds.4 They are summarized in the nitrogen cycle  
shown in Figure 6.10. This cycle describes the dynamic processes through which nitrogen is inter-
changed among the atmosphere, organic matter, and inorganic compounds. It is one of nature’s most 
vital dynamic processes.
Among the biochemical transformations in the nitrogen cycle are nitrogen fi  xation, whereby 
molecular nitrogen is fi  xed as organic nitrogen; nitrifi  cation, the process of oxidizing ammonia to 
nitrate; nitrate reduction, the process by which nitrogen in nitrate ion is reduced to form compounds 
having nitrogen in a lower oxidation state; and denitrifi  cation, the reduction of nitrate and nitrite to 
N2, with a resultant net loss of nitrogen gas to the atmosphere. Each of these important chemical 
processes will be discussed separately. TABLE 6.2

6.11.1 N ITROGEN  FIXATION
The overall microbial process for nitrogen fi  xation , the binding of atmospheric nitrogen in a chemically 
combined form
 3{CH2O} + 2N2 + 3H2O + 4H+ Æ 3CO2 + 4NH4+ (6.17)
is actually quite a complicated process that is the subject of extensive investigation. Biological nitro-
gen fi  xation is a key biochemical process in the environment and is essential for plant growth in the 
absence of synthetic fertilizers.
Only a few species of aquatic microorganisms have the ability to fi  x atmospheric nitrogen. 
Among the aquatic bacteria having this capability are photosynthetic bacteria, Azotobacter , several 
species of Clostridium , and cyanobacteria. In most natural freshwater systems, however, the frac-
tion of nitrogen fi  xed by organisms in the water relative to that originating from the decay of organic 
material, fertilizer runoff, and other external sources is relatively low.
The best-known and most important form of nitrogen-fi  xing bacteria is Rhizobium , which enjoys 
a symbiotic (mutually advantageous) relationship with leguminous plants such as clover or alfalfa. 
The Rhizobium  bacteria are found in root nodules, special structures bound to the roots of legumes 
(see Figure 16.2) and connected directly to the vascular (circulatory) system of the plant, enabling 
the bacteria to derive photosynthetically produced energy directly from the plant. Thus, the plant 
provides the energy required to break the strong triple bonds in the dinitrogen molecule, converting 
the nitrogen to a reduced form which is directly assimilated by the plant. When the legumes die and 
decay, NH4+ ion is released and is converted by microorganisms to nitrate ion, which is assimilable 
by other plants. Some of the ammonium ion and nitrate released may be carried into natural water 
systems.
Some nonlegume angiosperms fi  x nitrogen through the action of actinomycetes bacteria con-
tained in root nodules. Shrubs and trees in the nitrogen-fi  xing category are abundant in fi  elds, 
 forests, and wetlands throughout the world. Their rate of nitrogen fi  xation is comparable to that of 
legumes.
Free-living bacteria associated with some grasses are stimulated by the grasses to fi  x nitrogen. 
One such bacterium is Spirillumlipoferum . In tropical surroundings, the amount of reduced nitrogen 
fi xed by such bacteria can amount to the order of 100 kg per hectare per year.Nitrogen fixation

B ec a u s e  o f  th e  c o s t  o f  e n e r gy  r eq uir ed  t o  fi  x nitrogen synthetically, efforts are underway to 
increase the effi  ciency of natural means of nitrogen fi  xation. One approach uses recombinant DNA 
methodologies in attempts to transfer the nitrogen-fi  xin g  c a p a b ili ti e s  o f  ni tr o g e n - fi  xing bacteria 
directly to plant cells. Although a fascinating possibility, this transfer has not yet been achieved on 
a practical basis. The other approach uses more conventional plant breeding and biological tech-
niques in attempts to increase the range and effectiveness of the symbiotic relationship existing 
between some plants and nitrogen-fi  xing bacteria.
One matter of concern is that successful efforts to increase nitrogen fi  xation may upset the global 
nitrogen balance. Total annual global fi  xation of nitrogen is now more than 50% higher than the 
preindustrial level of 150 million metric tons estimated for 1850. Potential accumulation of excess 
fi xed nitrogen is the subject of some concern because of aquatic nitrate pollution and microbial 
production of N2O gas. Some atmospheric scientists fear that excess N2O gas may be involved in 
depletion of the protective atmospheric ozone layer (see Chapter 14).
6.11.2 N ITRIFICATION
Nitrifi  cation , the conversion of N(−III) to N(V), is a very common and extremely important process 
in water and in soil. Aquatic nitrogen in thermodynamic equilibrium with air is in the +5 oxidation 
state as NO3−, whereas in most biological compounds, nitrogen is present as N(−III), such as –NH2 
in amino acids. The equilibrium constant of the overall nitrifi  cation reaction, written for one 
 electron-mole
 11 1 11
24 3 2 48 8 48ON H N OHH O+- ++Æ+ + (6.18)
is 107.59 (Table 6.1), showing that the reaction is highly favored from a thermodynamic viewpoint.
Nitrifi  cation is especially important in nature because nitrogen is absorbed by plants prima rily 
as nitrate. When fertilizers are applied in the form of ammonium salts or anhydrous ammonia, a 
microbial transformation to nitrate enables maximum assimilation of nitrogen by the plants.
In nature, nitrifi  cation is catalyzed by two groups of bacteria, Nitrosomonas  and Nitrobacter. 
Nitrosomonas  bacteria bring about the transition of ammonia to nitrite

Both of these highly specialized types of bacteria are obligate aerobes ; that is, they function only 
in the presence of molecular O2. These bacteria are also chemolithotrophic , meaning that they can 
utilize oxidizable inorganic materials as electron donors in oxidation reactions to yield needed 
energy for metabolic processes.
For the oxic conversion of one electron-mole of ammoniacal nitrogen to nitrite ion at pH 7.00,
 11 1 11
24 2 2 46 6 36ON H N OHH O+- ++Æ+ + (6.21)
the free-energy change is −10.8 kcal. The free-energy change for the oxic oxidation of one electron-
mole of nitrite ion to nitrate ion:
 11 1
22 3 42 2ON O N O--+Æ (6.22)
is −9.0 kcal. Both steps of the nitrifi  cation process involve an appreciable yield of free energy.146 Environmental Chemistry
6.11.3 N ITRATE  REDUCTION
As a general term, nitrate reduction  refers to microbial processes by which nitrogen in chemical 
compounds is reduced to lower oxidation states. In the absence of free oxygen, nitrate may be used 
by some bacteria as an alternate electron receptor. The most complete possible reduction of nitrogen 
in nitrate ion involves the acceptance of eight electrons by the nitrogen atom, with the consequent 
conversion of nitrate to ammonia ( +V to −III oxidation state). Nitrogen is an essential component of 
protein, and any organism that utilizes nitrogen from nitrate for the synthesis of protein must fi  rst 
reduce the nitrogen to the −III oxidation state (ammoniacal form). However, incorporation of nitro-
gen into protein generally is a relatively minor use of the nitrate undergoing microbially mediated 
reactions and is more properly termed nitrate assimilation.
Nitrate ion functioning as an electron receptor usually produces NO2−:
 --+Æ +11 11 1
32 2 2 2 24 24 4NO {CH O} NO H O + CO (6.23)
The free-energy yield per electron-mole is only about two-third of the yield when oxygen is the oxidant; 
however, nitrate ion is a good electron receptor in the absence of O2. One of the factors limiting the use 
of nitrate ion in this function is its generally low concentration in most waters. Furthermore, nitrite, 
NO2−, is relatively toxic and tends to inhibit the growth of many bacteria after building up to a certain 
level. Sodium nitrate has been used as a “fi  rs t -ai d” treatmen t in se w ag e lag oons that ha v e beco me 
 oxygen defi  cient. It provides an emergency source of oxygen to reestablish normal bacterial growth.
Nitrate ion can be an effective oxidizing agent for a number of species in water that are oxidized 
by the action of microorganisms. Therefore, nitrate salts are sometimes added as an alternate source 
of oxygen in the biological treatment of oxidizable wastes.
6.11.4 D ENITRIFICATION
An important special case of nitrate reduction is denitrifi  cation , in which the reduced nitrogen 
product is a nitrogen-containing gas, usually N2. At pH 7.00, the free-energy change per electron-
mole of reaction
 7 11 1 1 1
32 2 2 2 54 5 1 0 4 2 0NO {CH O} H N CO H O+++ Æ + +−
 (6.24)
is −2.84 kcal. The free-energy yield per mole of nitrate reduced to N2 (fi ve electron-moles) is lower 
than that for the reduction of the same quantity of nitrate to nitrite. More important, however, the 
reduction of a nitrate ion to N2 gas consumes fi  ve electrons, compared to only two electrons for the 
reduction of NO3− to NO2−.
Denitrifi  cation is an important process in nature. It is the mechanism by which fi  xed nitrogen is 
returned to the atmosphere. Denitrifi  cation is also used in advanced water treatment for the removal 
of nutrient nitrogen (see Chapter 8). Because nitrogen gas is a nontoxic volatile substance that does 
not inhibit microbial growth, and since nitrate ion is a very effi  cient electron acceptor, denitrifi  ca-
tion allows the extensive growth of bacteria under anoxic conditions.
Loss of nitrogen to the atmosphere may also occur through the formation of N2O and NO by 
bacterial action on nitrate and nitrite catalyzed by the action of several types of bacteria. Production 
of N2O relative to N2 is enhanced during denitrifi  cation in soils by increased concentrations of NO3−, 
NO2−, and O2.
6.11.5  COMPETITIVE  OXIDATION  OF ORGANIC  MATTER BY NITRATE  ION AND 
OTHER OXIDIZING  AGENTS
The successive oxidation of organic matter by dissolved O2, NO3−, and SO42− brings about an interest-
ing sequence of nitrate-ion levels in sediments and hypolimnion waters initially containing O2 but Aquatic Microbial Biochemistry 147
lacking a mechanism for reaeration. This is shown in Figure 6.11, where concentrations of dissolved 
O2, NO3−, and SO42− are plotted as a function of total organic matter metabolized. This behavior can 
be explained by the following sequence of biochemical processes:
 O2 + organic matter  Æ products (6.25)
 NO3− + organic matter  Æ products (6.26)
 SO42− + organic matter  Æ products (6.27)
So long as some O2 is present, some nitrate may be produced from nitrogenous organic matter. After 
exhaustion of molecular oxygen, nitrate is the favored oxidizing agent, and its concentration falls 
from a maximum value (I) to zero (II). Sulfate, which is usually present in a large excess over the 
other two oxidants, then becomes the favored electron receptor, enabling biodegradation of organic 
matter to continue. 
6.12 MICROBIAL TRANSFORMATIONS OF PHOSPHORUS AND SULFUR
6.12.1 P HOSPHORUS  COMPOUNDS
Biodegradation of phosphorus compounds is important in the environment for two reasons. The fi  rst 
of these is that it provides a source of algal nutrient orthophosphate from the hydrolysis of polyphos-
phates (see Section 3.16). Secondly, biodegradation deactivates toxic organophosphate compounds, 
such as the organophosphate insecticides.
The organophosphorus compounds of greatest environmental concern tend to be sulfur-contain-
ing phosphorothionate  and phosphordithioate  ester insecticides. These are discussed in more detail 
in Chapter 7, Section 7.11, and structural formulas of several representative examples are shown in 
Figure 7.8. The biodegradation of these compounds is an important environmental chemical pro-
cess. Fortunately, unlike the organohalide insecticides that they largely displaced until less toxic 
classes of compounds came into general use, the organophosphates readily undergo biodegradation 
and do not bioaccumulate.
Hydrolysis is an important step in the biodegradation of phosphorothionate, phosphorodithioate, 
and phosphate ester insecticides leading to their detoxifi  cation and loss of insecticidal activity. 
Hydrolysis of these insecticides is shown by the following general reactions where R is an alkyl Concentration o f oxidant

6.12.2 S ULFUR  COMPOUNDS
Sulfur compounds are very common in water. Sulfate ion, SO42−, is found in varying concentrations 
in practically all natural waters. Organic sulfur compounds, both those of natural origin and pollut-
ant species, are very common in natural aquatic systems, and the degradation of these compounds 
is an important microbial process. Sometimes the degradation products, such as odiferous and toxic 
H2S, cause serious problems with water quality.
Sulfur in living material is present primarily in its most reduced state, for example, as the hydro-
sulfi de group, −SH. When organic sulfur compounds are decomposed by bacteria, the initial sulfur 
product is generally the reduced form, H2S. Some bacteria produce and store elemental sulfur from 
sulfur compounds. In the presence of oxygen, some bacteria convert reduced forms of sulfur to the 
oxidized form in SO42− ion.
6.12.2.1 Oxidation of H2S and Reduction of Sulfate by Bacteria
In the presence of oxygen some bacteria can oxidize sulfi  de (H2S) to sulfate and in the absence of 
oxygen other bacteria can reduce sulfate to sulfi  de.5 The bacteria Desulfovibrio  can reduce inorganic 
sulfate ion to H2S. In so doing, they utilize sulfate as an electron acceptor in the oxidation of organic 
matter. The overall reaction for the microbially mediated oxidation of biomass with sulfate is
 SO42− + 2{CH2O} + 2H+ Æ H2S + 2CO2 + 2H2O (6.30)
and it requires other bacteria besides Desulfovibrio  to o xidize organic matter completely to CO2. 
Because of the high concentration of sulfate ion in seawater, bacterially mediated formation of H2S 
causes pollution problems in some coastal areas and is a major source of atmospheric sulfur. In waters 
where sulfi  de formation occurs, the sediment is often black in color due to the formation of FeS.

hydrogen sulfi  de to higher oxidation states. The oxic colorless sulfur bacteria may use molecular 
oxygen to oxidize H2S to elemental sulfur and can oxidize elemental S and thiosulfate (S2O32−) to 
sulfate.
Oxidation of sulfur in a low oxidation state to sulfate ion produces sulfuric acid, a strong acid. 
One of the colorless sulfur bacteria, Thiobacillus thiooxidans , is tolerant of one normal acid solu-
tions; a remarkable acid tolerance. When elemental sulfur is added to excessively alkaline soils, the 
acidity is increased because of a microorganism-mediated reaction, which produces sulfuric acid. 
Elemental sulfur may be deposited as granules in the cells of purple sulfur bacteria and colorless 
sulfur bacteria. Such processes are important sources of elemental sulfur deposits.Aquatic Microbial Biochemistry 149
6.12.3 M ICROORGANISM -MEDIATED  DEGRADATION  OF ORGANIC  SULFUR  COMPOUNDS
Sulfur occurs in many types of biological compounds. As a consequence, organic sulfur compounds 
of natural and pollutant origin are very common in water. The degradation of these compounds is 
an important microbial process having a strong effect upon water quality.
Among some of the common sulfur-containing functional groups found in aquatic organic 
 compounds are hydrosulfi  de (–SH), disulfi  de (–SS–), sulfi  de (–S–), sulfoxide ()O
S, sulfonic acid 
(–SO2OH), thioketone ()CS, and thiazole (a heterocyclic sulfur group). Protein contains some 
amino acids with sulfur functional groups—cysteine,

cystine, and methionine—whose breakdown is important in natural waters. The amino acids are 
readily degraded by bacteria and fungi. The biodegradation of sulfur-containing amino acids can

Hydrogen sulfi  de is formed from a large variety of organic compounds through the action of a 
 number of different kinds of microorganisms. A typical sulfur-cleavage reaction producing H2S 
is the conversion of cysteine to pyruvic acid through the action of cysteine desulfhydrase enzyme 
in bacteria:

 (6.31)
Because of the numerous forms in which organic sulfur may exist, a variety of sulfur products and 
biochemical reaction paths must be associated with the biodegradation of organic sulfur compounds.
6.13  MICROBIAL TRANSFORMATIONS OF HALOGENS 
AND ORGANOHALIDES
Microbially mediated reactions are important in the environmental degradation of pollutant organo-
halide compounds.6 Dehalogenation  reactions involving the replacement of a halogen atom, for 
example,
OH 
Remainder of 
molecule Remainder of 
molecule Cl 
represent a major pathway for the biodegradation of organohalide hydrocarbons. In some cases, 
organohalide compounds serve as sole carbon sources, sole energy sources, or electron acceptors for 
anoxic bacteria. Microorganisms need not utilize a particular organohalide compound as a sole 
 carbon source in order to cause its degradation. This is due to the phenomenon of cometabolism , 
which results from a lack of specifi  city in the microbial degradation processes. Thus, bacterial 150 Environmental Chemistry
 degradation of small amounts of an organohalide compound may occur while the microorganism 
involved is metabolizing much larger quantities of another substance.
Some anoxic bacteria can reductively dechlorinate chlorinated aliphatic and aromatic compounds 
using relatively highly chlorinated compounds as electron acceptors as illustrated by the reaction
 {CH2O} + H2O + 2Cl−R  Æ CO2 + 2H+ + 2Cl− + 2H−R (6.32)
where Cl–R represents a site of chlorine substitution on a chlorinated hydrocarbon molecule and 
H–R represents a site of hydrogen substitution. The net result of this process called dehalorespira-
tion is the replacement of Cl by H on chlorinated hydrocarbons. 
Microbially mediated dichloroelimination from 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane in the anoxic biodegra-
dation of this compound can produce one of three possible isomers of dichloroethylene; the process 
followed by successive hydrogenolysis reactions can produce vinyl chloride and ethene (ethylene):

6.14 MICROBIAL TRANSFORMATIONS OF METALS AND METALLOIDS
Some bacteria, including Ferrobacillus , Gallionella , and some forms of Sphaerotilus , utilize iron 
compounds to obtain energy for their metabolic needs. These bacteria catalyze the oxidation of 
iron(II) to iron(III) by molecular oxygen:
 4Fe(II)  + 4H+ + O2 Æ 4Fe(III)  + 2H2O (6.35)Aquatic Microbial Biochemistry 151
The carbon source for some of these bacteria is CO2. Since they do not require organic matter for 
carbon, and they derive energy from the oxidation of inorganic matter, these bacteria may thrive in 
environments where organic matter is absent.
The microorganism-mediated oxidation of iron(II) is not a particularly effi  cient means of obtain-
ing energy for metabolic processes. For the reaction
 ++ Æ +3 1
32 2 32 42 FeCO ( ) O H O Fe(OH) ( ) CO ss (6.36)
the change in free energy is approximately 10 kcal/electron-mole. Approximately 220 g of iron(II) 
must be oxidized to produce 1.0 g of cell carbon. The calculation assumes CO2 as a carbon source 
and a biological effi  ciency of 5%. The production of only 1.0 g of cell carbon would produce approx-
imately 430 g of solid Fe(OH)3. It follows that large deposits of hydrated iron(III) oxide form in 
areas where iron-oxidizing bacteria thrive.
Some of the iron bacteria, notably Gallionella , secrete large quantities of hydrated iron(III) oxide in 
intricately branched structures. The bacterial cell grows at the end of a twisted stalk of the iron oxide. 
Individual cells of Gallionella , photographed through an electron microscope, have shown that the 
stalks consist of a number of strands of iron oxide secreted from one side of the cell (Figure 6.12).
At nearly neutral pH values, bacteria deriving energy by mediating the air oxidation of iron(II) 
must compete with direct chemical oxidation of iron(II) by O2. The latter process is relatively rapid 
at pH 7. As a consequence, these bacteria tend to grow in a narrow layer in the region between the 
oxygen source and the source of iron(II). Therefore, iron bacteria are sometimes called gradient 
organisms , and they grow at intermediate p E values.
Bacteria are strongly involved in the oceanic manganese cycle. Manganese nodules, a potentially 
important source of manganese, copper, nickel, and cobalt that occur on ocean fl  oors, yield different 
species of bacteria which enzymatically mediate both the oxidation and reduction of manganese.
6.14.1 A CID MINE WATERS
One consequence of bacterial action on metal compounds is acid mine drainage, one of the most 
common and damaging problems in the aquatic environment. Many waters fl  owing from coal mines 
and draining from the “gob piles” left over from coal processing and washing are practically sterile 
due to high acidity.Individual strand of hydrated 
iron(III) hydroxide 
Stalk of h ydrated iron(III) h ydroxide Cell 
FIGURE 6.12 Sketch of a cell of Gallionella  showing iron(III) oxide secretion.152 Environmental Chemistry
Acid mine water results from the presence of sulfuric acid produced by the oxidation of pyrite, 
FeS2. Microorganisms are closely involved in the overall process, which consists of several reactions 
and involves a number of microbial species that can exist under acidic conditions. The fi  rst of these 
reactions is the oxidation of pyrite, which is followed by the oxidation of iron(II) ion to iron(III) ion:
 2FeS2(s) + 2H2O + 7O2 Æ 4H+ + 4SO42− + 2Fe2+ (6.37)
 4Fe2+ + O2 + 4H+ Æ 4Fe3+ + 2H2O (6.38)
a process that occurs very slowly at low pH values found in acid mine waters. Below pH 3.5, the iron 
oxidation is catalyzed by the iron bacterium Thiobacillus ferrooxidans , and in the pH range 3.5–4.5 
it may be catalyzed by a variety of Metallogenium , a fi lamentous iron bacterium. Other bacteria that 
may be involved in acid mine water formation are Thiobacillus thiooxidans  and Ferrobacillus 
 ferrooxidans . The Fe3+ ion further dissolves pyrite
 FeS2(s) + 14Fe3+ + 8H2O Æ 15Fe2+ + 2SO42− + 16H+ (6.39)
which in conjunction with Reaction 6.38 constitutes a cycle for the dissolution of pyrite. Fe(H2O)63+ 
is an acidic ion and at pH values much above 3, the iron(III) precipitates as the hydrated iron(III) 
oxide:
 Fe3+ + 3H2O Æ Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+ (6.40)
The beds of streams affl  icted with acid mine drainage often are covered with “yellowboy,” an 
unsightly deposit of amorphous, semigelatinous Fe(OH)3. The most damaging component of acid 
mine water, however, is sulfuric acid. It is directly toxic and has other undesirable effects such as 
excessive weathering of minerals that it contacts.
Limestone, CaCO3, is commonly used to treat acid mine water. When acid mine water is treated 
with limestone, the following reaction occurs:
 CaCO3(s) + 2H+ + SO42− Æ Ca2+ + SO42− + H2O + CO2(g) (6.41)
Unfortunately, because iron(III) is generally present, Fe(OH)3 p r e c i p i t a t e s  a s  t h e  p H  i s  r a i s e d  
(Reaction 6.40). The hydrated iron(III) oxide product covers the particles of carbonate rock with a 
relatively impermeable layer. This armoring effect prevents further neutralization of the acid.
6.14.2 M ICROBIAL  TRANSITIONS  OF SELENIUM
Directly below sulfur in the periodic table, selenium is subject to bacterial oxidation and reduction. 
These transitions are important because selenium is a crucial element in nutrition, particularly of 
livestock. Diseases related to either selenium excesses or defi  ciency have been reported in at least 
half of the states of the United States and in 20 other countries, including the major livestock 
 producing countries. Livestock in New Zealand, in particular, suffer from selenium defi  ciency.
Microorganisms are closely involved with the selenium cycle, and microbial reduction of oxi-
dized forms of selenium has been known for some time. Reductive processes under anoxic condi-
tions can reduce both SeO32− and SeO42− ions to elemental selenium, which can accumulate as a sink 
f o r  s e l e n i u m  i n  a n o x i c  s e d i m e n t s .  S o m e  b a c t e r i a  s u c h  a s  s e l e c t e d  s t r a i n s  o f  Thiobacillus  and 
Leptothrix  can oxidize elemental selenium to selenite, SeO32−, thus remobilizing this element from 
deposits of Se(0).
The major volatile selenium species emitted to the atmosphere by microbial processes in water 
and soil is dimethylselenide, (CH3)2Se. (The single largest source of natural sulfur discharged to the Aquatic Microbial Biochemistry 153
atmosphere is the analogous sulfur compound, biogenic dimethyl sulfi  de, (CH3)2S, from marine 
sources; see Section 11.4.) The major biological selenium compound that is the precursor to dimethyl-
selenide formation is selenomethionine:

HHN H2H3CO
CCCC Selenomethionine Se OH
6.14.3 M ICROBIAL  CORROSION
Corrosion involving the deterioration of iron as well as other metals is a redox phenomenon and was 
discussed in Section 4.14. Much corrosion is bacterial in nature.7 Bacteria involved with corrosion 
set up their own electrochemical cells in which a portion of the surface of the metal being corroded 
forms the anode of the cell and is oxidized. Structures called tubercles  form in which bacteria pit 
and corrode metals as shown in Figure 6.13.

7.1 NATURE AND TYPES OF WATER POLLUTANTS
Throughout history, the quality of drinking water has been a factor in determining human welfare. 
Fecal pollution of drinking water has frequently caused waterborne diseases that have decimated 
the populations of whole cities. Unwholesome water polluted by sewage has caused great hardship 
for people forced to drink it or use it for irrigation. Although waterborne diseases are now well 
controlled in technologically advanced countries, the shortage of safe drinking water is still a major 
problem in regions affl  icted by strife and poverty.
An ongoing concern with water safety now is the potential presence of chemical pollutants. These 
may include organic chemicals, inorganics, and heavy metals from industrial, urban runoff, and agricul-
tural sources. Water pollutants can be divided into some general categories, as summarized in Table 7.1. 
Most of these categories of pollutants, and several subcategories, are discussed in this chapter.
7.1.1 M ARKERS  OF WATER POLLUTION
Markers of water pollution  are substances that show the presence of pollution sources. These include 
herbicides indicative of agricultural runoff, fecal coliform bacteria that are characteristic of pollu-
tion from sewage, and pharmaceuticals, pharmaceutical metabolites, and even caffeine that show 
contamination by domestic wastewater.
Biomarkers of water pollution  are organisms that live in or are closely associated with bodies of 
water and provide evidence of pollution either from accumulation of water pollutants or their metab-
olites or from effects on the organism due to pollutant exposure. Fish are the most common bio-
indicators of water pollution, and fi  sh lipid (fat) tissue is commonly analyzed for persistent organic 
water pollutants.
An organism that has been described as “a worldwide sentinel species to assess and monitor envi-
ronmental pollution in rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and estuaries”1 is the ospre y ( Pandionhaliaetus ), a 
large raptor bird with a wingspan that can exceed 1.5 m and a mass up to 2 kg. Found in all continents 
throughout the world except for Antarctica, the osprey feeds almost exclusively on fi  sh. In addition to 
these characteristics, other aspects of the osprey that make it a good indicator species are that it is well 
adapted to human landscapes where pollution is most likely to occur, it is at the top of the aquatic food 
web through which persistent pollutants undergo bioaccumulation and biomagnifi  cation, it is sensitive 
to many pollutants, and it has a relatively long life span. This bird builds highly visible nests that are 
evenly dispersed over wide areas, usually remains with a single nest, and tolerates disturbance of nests 
for brief periods. The osprey is very sensitive to some pollutants, and although populations are now 
comfortably high, they were almost wiped out by the effects of DDT before that insecticide was 
banned. Chemical and biochemical analyses of osprey feathers, eggs, blood, and organs along with 
observations of behavior, nesting habits, and populations have been used to assess water pollution.

some of these are essential plant and animal nutrients at low levels but toxic at higher levels. Several 
of them, such as lead or mercury, have such toxicological and environmental signifi  cance that they 
are discussed in detail in separate sections.
A few of the heavy metals  are among the most harmful of the elemental pollutants and are of 
particular concern because of their toxicities to humans. These elements are in general the transition 
metals, and some of the representative elements, such as lead and tin, are placed in the lower right-
hand corner of the periodic table. Heavy metals include essential elements like iron as well as toxic 
metals like cadmium and mercury. Most of them have a tremendous affi  nity for sulfur and disrupt 
enzyme function by forming bonds with sulfur groups in enzymes. Protein carboxylic acid (–CO2H) 
and amino (–NH2) groups are also chemically bound by heavy metals. Cadmium, copper, lead, and 
mercury ions bind to cell membranes, hindering transport processes through the cell wall. Heavy 
metals may also precipitate phosphate biocompounds or catalyze their decomposition. The bio-
chemical effects of metals are discussed in Chapter 24.
Some of the metalloids , elements on the borderline between metals and nonmetals, are signifi  -
cant water pollutants. Arsenic, selenium, and antimony are of particular interest.
Inorganic chemicals’  manufacture has the potential to contaminate water with trace elements. 
Among the industries regulated for potential trace element pollution of water are those producing 
chlor-alkali, hydrofl  uoric acid, sodium dichromate (sulfate process and chloride ilmenite process), 
aluminum fl  uoride, chrome pigments, copper sulfate, nickel sulfate, sodium bisulfate, sodium 
hydrosulfate, sodium bisulfi  te, titanium dioxide, and hydrogen cyanide.
7.3 HEAVY METALS
7.3.1 C ADMIUM
Pollutant cadmium  in water may arise from mining wastes and industrial discharges, especially 
from metal plating. Chemically, cadmium is very similar to zinc, and these two metals frequently 
undergo geochemical processes together. Both metals are found in water in the +2 oxidation state.
The effects of acute cadmium poisoning in humans include high blood pressure, kidney damage, 
damage to testicular tissue, and destruction of red blood cells. Much of the physiological action of cad-
mium is due to its chemical similarity to zinc. Cadmium may replace zinc in some enzymes, thereby 
altering the stereostructure of the enzyme and impairing its catalytic activity, causing disease symptoms.
Cadmium and zinc are common water and sediment pollutants in harbors surrounded by indus-
trial installations. Concentrations of more than 100 ppm dry weight sediment have been found in 
harbor sediments. Typically, during periods of calm in the summer when the water stagnates, the 
anaerobic bottom layer of harbor water has a low soluble Cd concentration because microbial reduc-
tion of sulfate by organic matter, {CH2O}, produces sulfi  de, which precipitates cadmium as insoluble 
cadmium sulfi  de:
 2{CH2O} + SO42- + H+ Æ 2CO2 + HS- + 2H2O (7.1)
 CdCl+(chloro complex in seawater) + HS- Æ CdS( s) + H+ + Cl- (7.2)
Mixing of bay water from outside the harbor and harbor water by high winds during the winter 
results in desorption of cadmium from harbor sediments by aerobic bay water. This dissolved cad-
mium is carried out into the bay where it is absorbed by suspended solid materials, which then 
becomes incorporated with the bay sediments. This is an example of the sort of complicated inter-
action of hydraulic, chemical solution–solid, and microbiological factors involved in the transport 
and distribution of a pollutant in an aquatic system.
7.3.2 L EAD
Inorganic lead arising from a number of industrial and mining sources and formerly from leaded 
gasoline occurs in water in the +2 oxidation state. In addition to pollutant sources, lead-bearing 162 Environmental Chemistry
limestone and galena (PbS) contribute lead to natural waters in some locations. Evidence from hair 
samples and other sources indicates that body burdens of this toxic metal have decreased during 
recent decades, largely the result of less lead used in plumbing and other products that come in 
contact with food or drink.
Acute lead poisoning in humans causes severe dysfunction in the kidneys, reproductive system, 
liver, and the brain and central nervous system and results in sickness or death. Lead poisoning from 
environmental exposure is thought to have caused mental retardation in many children. Mild lead 
poisoning causes anemia. The victim may have headaches and sore muscles, and may feel generally 
fatigued and irritable.
Except in isolated cases, lead is probably not a major problem in drinking water, although the 
potential exists in cases where old lead pipes are still in use. Lead used to be a constituent of solder 
and some pipe-joint formulations, such that household water does have some contact with lead. 
Water that has stood in household plumbing for some time may have elevated levels of lead (along 
with zinc, cadmium, and copper) and should be drained for a while before use.
7.3.3 M ERCURY
Because of its toxicity, mobilization as methylated forms by anaerobic bacteria, and other pollution 
factors, mercury generates a great deal of concern as a heavy-metal pollutant. Mercury is found as 
a trace component of many minerals, with continental rocks containing an average of around 
80 parts per billion, or slightly less, of this element. Fossil fuel coal and lignite contain mercury, 
often at levels of 100 parts per billion or even higher, and emissions from the combustion of these 
fuels are a major source of environmental mercury.
Metallic mercury once was commonly used as an electrode in the electrolytic generation of chlo-
rine gas, in laboratory vacuum apparatus, and in other applications, and signifi  cant quantities of 
inorganic mercury(I) and mercury(II) compounds were used annually. Organic mercury compounds 
used to be widely applied as pesticides, particularly fungicides. These mercury compounds included 
aryl mercurials such as phenyl mercuric dimethyldithiocarbamate,
 HgS
S NCH3
CH3C
(formerly used in paper mills as a slimicide and as a mold retardant for paper) and alkyl-mercu-
rials such as ethylmercuric chloride, C2H5HgCl, that was used as a seed fungicide. Because of 
concern over the health and environmental effects of mercury, these uses have been severely cur-
tailed in recent years. As of 2008, approximately 3800 metric tons of mercury were traded world-
wide each year.
Globally, one of the greatest sources of mercury pollution has been mercury used to extract gold 
from gold-bearing ores. It is estimated that each year 15 million miners in approximately 40 devel-
oping countries use 650–1000 metric tons of mercury to extract gold. This use subjects many local 
areas to mercury contamination and contributes signifi  cantly to the global environmental burden of 
mercury as well as exposing the miners, many of whom are children, to toxic mercury. The problem 
has been made worse in recent years as industrialized countries have reduced mercury use with the 
result that surplus mercury has been made available on the world market for gold extraction. In 
recognition of this problem, in 2008 the European Union adopted a mercury export ban to take 
effect in 2011 and the United States adopted a similar ban to be effective in 2013.
The toxicity of mercury was tragically illustrated in the Minamata Bay area of Japan during the 
period 1953–1960. A total of 111 cases of mercury poisoning and 43 deaths were reported among 
people who had consumed seafood from the bay that had been contaminated with mercury waste 
f r o m  a  c h e m i c a l  p l a n t  t h a t  d r a i n e d  i n t o  M i n a m a t a  B a y .  C o n g e n i t a l  d e f e c t s  w e r e  o b s e r v e d  i n  Water Pollution 163
19 babies whose mothers had consumed seafood contaminated with mercury. The level of metal in 
the contaminated seafood was 5–20 ppm. 
Among the toxicological effects of mercury are neurological damage, including irritability, 
paralysis, blindness, or insanity; chromosome breakage; and birth defects. The milder symptoms 
of mercury poisoning such as depression and irritability have a psychopathological character. 
Because of the resemblance of these symptoms to common human behavioral problems, mild 
 mercury poisoning may escape detection. Some forms of mercury are relatively nontoxic and were 
formerly used as medicines, for example, in the treatment of syphilis. Other forms of mercury, 
 particularly organic compounds, are highly toxic.
Because there are few major natural sources of mercury, and since most inorganic compounds of 
this element are relatively insoluble, it was assumed for some time that mercury was not a serious 
water pollutant. However, in 1970, alarming mercury levels were discovered in fi  sh in Lake Saint 
Clair located between Michigan and Ontario, Canada. A subsequent survey by the U.S. Federal 
Water Quality Administration revealed a number of other waters contaminated with mercury. It was 
found that several chemical plants, particularly caustic chemical manufacturing operations, were 
each releasing up to 14 or more kilograms of mercury in wastewaters each day.
The unexpectedly high concentrations of mercury found in water and in fi  sh tissues result from 
the formation of soluble monomethylmercury ion, CH3Hg+, and volatile dimethylmercury, (CH3)2Hg, 
by anaerobic bacteria in sediments. Mercury from these compounds becomes concentrated in fi  sh 
lipid (fat) tissue and the concentration factor from water to fi  sh may exceed 103. The methylating 
agent by which inorganic mercury is converted to methylmercury compounds is methylcobalamin, 
a vitamin B12 analog:
 23MethylcobalaminHgCl CH HgCl Cl-æææææææ Æ+ (7.3)
It is believed that the bacteria that synthesize methane produce methylcobalamin as an intermediate 
in the synthesis. Thus, waters and sediments in which anaerobic decay is occurring provide the 
conditions under which methylmercury production occurs. In neutral or alkaline waters, volatile 
dimethylmercury, (CH3)2Hg, may be formed.
7.4 METALLOIDS
The most signifi  cant water pollutant metalloid element is arsenic, a toxic element that has been the 
chemical villain of more than a few murder plots. Acute arsenic poisoning can result from the ingestion 
of more than about 100 mg of the element. Chronic poisoning occurs with the ingestion of small amounts 
of arsenic over a long period of time. There is some evidence that this element is also carcinogenic.
Arsenic occurs in the Earth’s crust at an average level of 2–5 ppm. The combustion of fossil fuels, 
particularly coal, introduces large quantities of arsenic into the environment, much of it reaching 
natural waters. Arsenic occurs with phosphate minerals and enters into the environment along with 
some phosphorus compounds. Some formerly used pesticides, particularly those from before World 
War II, contain highly toxic arsenic compounds. The most common of these are lead arsenate, 
Pb3(AsO4)2; sodium arsenite, Na3AsO3; and Paris green, Cu3(AsO3)2. Another major source of 
 arsenic is mine tailings. Arsenic produced as a by-product of copper, gold, and lead refi  ning exceeds 
the commercial demand for arsenic, and it accumulates as waste material. 
Like mercury, arsenic may be converted to more mobile and toxic methyl derivatives by bacteria, 
fi rst by reduction of H3AsO4 to H3AsO3 then by methylation to produce CH3AsO(OH)2 (methyl-
arsinic acid), (CH3)2AsO(OH) (dimethyarsinic acid), and (CH3)2AsH (dimethylarsine).
In what may have been the largest mass poisoning of a human population in history, between 
35 million and 77 million people of the 125 million inhabitants of Bangladesh have been exposed 
to potentially toxic levels of arsenic in drinking water. This catastrophic public health problem 164 Environmental Chemistry
has resulted from well-intentioned programs funded initially by the United Nations Children’s Fund 
to install shallow tube wells that provided a source of drinking water free from disease-causing 
pathogens. By 1987, numerous cases of arsenic-induced skin lesions characterized by  pigmentation 
changes, predominantly on the upper chest, arms, and legs, and keratoses of the palms of the hands 
and soles of the feet were being observed. These effects were characteristic of arsenic poisoning, 
leading to the discovery that arsenic-contaminated drinking water from the tube wells was respon-
sible for this. Since the initial discovery of arsenic poisoning, huge numbers of new cases have been 
r e v e al ed  an d  i t  i s  p o s s i b l e  th a t  te n s  o f  th o u s an d s  o f  peo p l e  in  B an g l a d e s h  w ill  di e  p r e m a tur e l y  
because of exposure to arsenic in drinking water. Other countries with acute problems from arsenic 
in drinking water include Vietnam (where large numbers of tube wells were drilled more recently 
than those in Bangladesh), Argentina, Chile, China, Mexico, Taiwan, and Thailand.
The geochemical conditions that result in arsenic contamination of water are often associated 
with the presence of iron, sulfur, and organic matter in (alluvial) deposits produced by water. Iron 
released from rocks eroded by river water forms iron oxide deposits on rock particle surfaces. The 
iron oxide accumulates arsenic and concentrates it from the river water. These particles then get 
buried along with degradable organic matter in sediments, and the insoluble iron(III) in the iron 
oxides is converted to soluble iron(II) by the anaerobic reducing conditions under which the organic 
matter biodegrades. This releases the bound arsenic that can get into well water.
7.5 ORGANICALLY BOUND METALS AND METALLOIDS
An appreciation of the strong infl  uence of complexation and chelation on heavy metals’ behavior in 
natural waters and wastewaters may be gained by reading Sections 3.10 through 3.17, which deal 
with that subject. Methylmercury formation is discussed in Section 7.3. Both topics involve the 
combination of metals and organic entities in water. It must be stressed that the interaction of metals 
with organic compounds is of utmost importance in determining the role played by the metal in an 
aquatic system.
There are two major types of metal–organic interactions to be considered in an aquatic system. 
The fi  rst of these is complexation, usually chelation when organic ligands are involved. As discussed 
in Chapter 3, complexation and chelation involve reversible binding of a metal ion with a ligand 
species.
Organometallic compounds, on the other hand, contain metals bound to organic entities by way 
of a carbon atom and do not dissociate reversibly at lower pH or greater dilution. Furthermore, the 
organic component, and sometimes the particular oxidation state of the metal involved, may not be 
stable apart from the organometallic compound. The major categories of organometallic compounds 
encountered in the environment are (1) those in which the organic group is an alkyl group such as 
ethyl in tetraethyl lead, Pb(C2H5)4; (2) carbonyls, some of which are quite volatile and toxic, having 
carbon monoxide bonded to metals; and (3) those in which the organic group is a π electron donor, 
such as ethylene (C2H4) or benzene (C6H6).
Combinations of the three general types of compounds outlined above exist, the most prominent 
of which are arene carbonyl species, in which a metal atom is bonded to both an aryl entity such as 
benzene and to several carbon monoxide molecules.
A large number of compounds exist that have at least one bond between the metal and a C atom 
on an organic group, as well as other covalent or ionic bonds between the metal and atoms other 
than carbon. An example is monomethylmercury chloride, CH3HgCl, in which the organometallic 
CH3Hg+ ion is ionically bonded to the chloride anion. Another class of compounds with organo-
metallic character are those that have organic groups bonded to a metal atom through atoms other 
than carbon. An example of such a compound is isopropyl titanate, Ti( i-OC3H7)4, in which the 
hydrocarbon groups are bonded to the metal by way of oxygen atoms.
The interaction of trace metals with organic compounds in natural waters is too vast an area to 
cover in detail in this chapter; however, it may be noted that metal–organic interactions may involve Water Pollution 165
organic species of both pollutant (such as EDTA) and natural (such as fulvic acids) origin. These 
interactions are infl  uenced by, and sometimes play a role in, redox equilibria, formation and dissolu-
tion of precipitates, colloid formation and stability, acid–base reactions, and  microorganism- mediated 
reactions in water. Metal–organic interactions may increase or decrease the toxicity of metals in 
aquatic ecosystems, and they have a strong infl  uence on the growth of algae in water.
7.5.1 O RGANOTIN  COMPOUNDS
Of all the metals, tin has had the greatest number of organometallic compounds in commercial use, 
with global production that reached 40,000 metric tons per year before uses were restricted because 
of concerns over water pollution. In addition to synthetic organotin compounds, methylated tin 
 species can be produced biologically in the environment. Figure 7.1 gives some examples of the 
many known organotin compounds.
Major industrial uses of organotin compounds in the past have included applications of tin com-
pounds in fungicides, acaricides, disinfectants, antifouling paints, stabilizers to lessen the effects of 
heat and light in polyvinylchloride (PVC) plastics, catalysts, and precursors for the formation of 
fi lms of SnO2 on glass. Tributyl tin (TBT) chloride and related TBT compounds have bactericidal, 
fungicidal, and insecticidal properties and formerly were of particular environmental signifi  cance 
because of their use as industrial biocides. In addition to TBT chloride, other TBT compounds used 
as biocides include the hydroxide, the naphthenate, bis(tributyltin) oxide, and tris(tributylstannyl) 
phosphate. TBT was once widely used in boat and ship hull coatings to prevent the growth of foul-
ing organisms. Other applications have included preservation of wood, leather, paper, and textiles. 
Antifungal TBT compounds have been used as slimicides in cooling tower water.
Obviously the many applications of organotin compounds for a variety of uses have posed a 
signifi  cant potential for environmental pollution. Because of their applications near or in contact 
with bodies of water, organotin compounds are potentially signifi  cant water pollutants and have 
b ee n  link e d  t o  e n d o c rin e  di s ru p ti o n  in  s h e ll fi  sh, oysters, and snails. Because of such concerns, 
 several countries, including the United States, England, and France, prohibited TBT application on 
vessels smaller than 25 m in length during the 1980s. In response to concerns over water pollution, 
in 2001 the International Maritime Organization agreed to ban organotin antifouling paints on ships 
and yachts. Provisions of this agreement came into effect in September 2008.
7.6 INORGANIC SPECIES
Some important inorganic water pollutants were mentioned in Sections 7.2 through 7.4 as part of the 
discussion of pollutant trace elements. Inorganic pollutants that contribute acidity, alkalinity, or salinity 
to water are considered separately in this chapter. Still another class is that of algal nutrients. This leaves 
unclassifi  ed, however, some important inorganic pollutant species, of which cyanide ion, CN-, is prob-
ably the most important. Others include ammonia, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfi  de, nitrite, and sulfi  te.

7.6.1 C YANIDE
Cyanide , a deadly poisonous substance, exists in water as HCN, a weak acid, Ka of 6 × 10-10. The 
cyanide ion has a strong affi  nity for many metal ions, forming relatively less toxic ferrocyanide, 
Fe(CN)64–, with iron(II), for example. Volatile HCN is very toxic and has been used in gas chamber 
executions in the United States.
Cyanide is widely used in industry, especially for metal cleaning and electroplating. It is also one 
of the main gas and coke scrubber effl  uent pollutants from gas works and coke ovens. Cyanide is

 discharge of cyanide from mineral processing operations into waterways.
7.6.2 A MMONIA  AND OTHER INORGANIC  POLLUTANTS
Excessive levels of ammoniacal nitrogen cause water-quality problems. Ammonia  is the initial prod-
uct of the decay of nitrogenous organic wastes, and its presence frequently indicates the presence of 
such wastes. It is a normal constituent of low-p E groundwaters and is sometimes added to drinking 
water as an aid to disinfection, where it reacts with chlorine to provide residual chlorine (see 
Section 8.11). Since the p Ka of ammonium ion, NH4+, is 9.26, most ammonia in water is present as 
NH4+ rather than as NH3.
Hydrogen sulfi  de , H2S, is a product of the anaerobic decay of organic matter containing sulfur. 
It is also produced in the anaerobic reduction of sulfate by microorganisms (see Chapter 6) and is 
evolved as a gaseous pollutant from geothermal waters. Wastes from chemical plants, paper mills, 
textile mills, and tanneries may also contain H2S. Its presence is easily detected by its characteristic 
rotten-egg odor. In water, H2S is a weak diprotic acid with p Ka1 of 6.99 and p Ka2 of 12.92; S2- is not 
present in normal natural waters. The sulfi  de ion has tremendous affi  nity for many heavy metals, 
and precipitation of metallic sulfi  des often accompanies production of H2S.
Free carbon dioxide , CO2, is frequently present in water at high levels due to decay of organic 
matter. It is also added to softened water during water treatment as part of a recarbonation process 
(see Chapter 8). Excessive carbon dioxide levels may make water more corrosive and may be harm-
ful to aquatic life.
Nitrite ion , NO2-, occurs in water as an intermediate oxidation state of nitrogen over a relatively 
narrow p E range. Nitrite is added to some industrial process water as a corrosion inhibitor. However, 
it rarely occurs in drinking water at levels over 0.1 mg/L.
Sulfi  te ion , SO32-, is found in some industrial wastewaters. Sodium sulfi  te is commonly added to 
boiler feedwaters as an oxygen scavenger:
 2SO32- + O2 Æ 2SO42- (7.4)
Since p Ka1 of sulfurous acid is 1.76 and p Ka2 is 7.20, sulfi  te exists as either HSO3- or SO32- in natural 
waters, depending on the pH. It may be noted that hydrazine, N2H4, also functions as an oxygen 
scavenger:
 N2H4 + O2 Æ 2H2O + N2(g) (7.5)
Perchlorate ion , ClO4-, emerged as a water pollution problem in some areas in the 1990s when 
advances in ion chromatography enabled its detection in the low parts per billion range of concentra-
tions. Ammonium perchlorate, NH4ClO4, has been widely manufactured as an oxidizer in solid rocket 
propellants and contamination from ammonium perchlorate manufacturing facilities has been regarded 
as the major source of contamination. Perchlorate in water is very unreactive and all common perchlo-
rate salts other than KClO4 are soluble, so it is diffi  cult to remove. Physiologically , it competes with 
iodide ion and diminishes essential iodide uptake by the thyroid. The U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency has recommended a drinking water standard for perchlorate of around 1 part per billion.Water Pollution 167
7.6.3 A SBESTOS  IN WATER
The toxicity of inhaled asbestos is well established. The fi  bers scar lung tissue and cancer eventually 
develops, often 20 or 30 years after exposure. It is not known for sure whether asbestos is toxic in 
drinking water. This has been a matter of considerable concern because of the dumping of taconite 
(iron ore tailings) containing asbestos-like fi  bers into Lake Superior. The fi  bers have been found in 
drinking waters of cities around the lake. After having dumped the tailings into Lake Superior since 
1952, the Reserve Mining Company at Silver Bay on Lake Superior solved the problem in 1980 by 
constructing a 6-square-mile containment basin inland from the lake. This $370-million facility 
keeps the taconite tailings covered with a 3-m layer of water to prevent the escape of fi  ber dust.
7.7 ALGAL NUTRIENTS AND EUTROPHICATION
The term eutrophication , derived from the Greek word meaning “well-nourished,” describes a con-
dition of lakes or reservoirs involving excess algal growth. Although some algal productivity is nec-
essary to support the food chain in an aquatic ecosystem, excess growth under eutrophic conditions 
may eventually lead to severe deterioration of the body of water. The fi  rst step in eutrophication of a 
body of water is an input of plant nutrients (Table 7.3) from watershed runoff or sewage. The nutrient-
rich body of water then produces a great deal of plant biomass by photosynthesis, along with a 
smaller amount of animal biomass. Dead biomass accumulates in the bottom of the lake, where it 
partially decays, recycling nutrient carbon dioxide, phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium. If the lake 
is not too deep, bottom-rooted plants begin to grow, accelerating the accumulation of solid material 
in the basin. Eventually a marsh is formed, which fi  nally fi  lls in to produce a meadow or forest. 
Eutrophication is often a natural phenomenon; for instance, it is basically responsible for the 
formation of huge deposits of coal and peat. However, human activity can greatly accelerate the 
process. To understand why this is so, consider that most of the nutrients required for plant and algae 
growth shown in Table 7.3 are available in adequate amounts from natural sources. The nutrients 
most likely to be limiting are the “fertilizer” elements: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. All 
these are present in sewage and are, of course, found in runoff from heavily fertilized fi  elds. They 
are also constituents of various kinds of industrial wastes. Each of these elements can also come

bacteria, cyanobacteria, or discharge of lightning in the atmosphere.
In some cases, ni tro g en or e v en carbon ma y be the limi ting nutri ents, the presence o f w hi ch 
determines the rate of algal growth. This is particularly true of nitrogen in seawater. In seawater, 
micronutrients, particularly iron, may be limiting.
In most cases in freshwaters, the single plant nutrient most likely to be limiting is phosphorus, 
and it is generally regarded as the culprit in excessive eutrophication. Household detergents were 
once a common source of phosphate in wastewater, and eutrophication control has concentrated on 
eliminating phosphates from detergents, removing phosphate at the sewage treatment plant, and 
preventing phosphate-laden sewage effl  uents from entering bodies of water enabling the excessive 
growth of algae that can cause eutrophication.
7.8 ACIDITY, ALKALINITY, AND SALINITY
Aquatic biota are sensitive to extremes of pH. Largely because of osmotic effects, they cannot live 
in a medium having a salinity to which they are not adapted. Thus, a freshwater fi  sh soon succumbs 
in the ocean, and sea fi  sh normally cannot live in freshwater. Excess salinity soon kills plants not 
adapted to it. There are, of course, ranges in salinity and pH in which organisms live. As shown in 
Figure 7.2, these ranges frequently may be represented by a reasonably symmetrical curve, along 
the fringes of which an organism may live without really thriving. These curves do not generally 
exhibit a sharp cutoff at one end or the other, as does the high-temperature end of the curve repre-
senting the growth of bacteria as a function of temperature (Figure 6.7).
The most common source of pollutant acid  in water is acid mine drainage. The sulfuric acid in 
such drainage arises from the microbial oxidation of pyrite or other sulfi  de minerals as described in 
Chapter 6. The values of pH encountered in acid-polluted water may fall below 3, a condition deadly 
to most forms of aquatic life except the culprit bacteria mediating the pyrite and iron(II) oxidation, 
which thrive under very low pH conditions. Industrial wastes frequently have the potential to con-
tribute strong acid to water. Sulfuric acid produced by the air oxidation of pollutant sulfur dioxide 
(see Chapter 11) enters natural waters as acidic rainfall. In cases where the water does not have 
contact with a basic mineral, such as limestone, the water pH may become dangerously low. This 
condition occurs in some Canadian lakes, for example.
Excess alkalinity , and frequently accompanying high pH, generally are not introduced directly 
into water from anthropogenic sources. However, in many geographic areas, the soil and mineral 
strata are alkaline and impart a high alkalinity to water. Human activity can aggravate the situation, 
for example, by exposure of alkaline overburden from strip mining to surface water or groundwater. 
Excess alkalinity in water is manifested by a characteristic fringe of white salts at the edges of a 
body of water or on the banks of a stream.

Water salinity may be increased by a number of human activities. Water passing through a 
municipal water system inevitably picks up salt from sources such as recharging water softeners 
with sodium chloride. Salts can leach from spoil piles. One of the major environmental constraints 
on the production of shale oil, for example, is the high percentage of leachable sodium sulfate in 
piles of spent shale. Careful control of these wastes is necessary to prevent further saline pollution 
of water in areas where salinity is already a problem. Irrigation adds a great deal of salt to water, a 
phenomenon responsible for the Salton Sea in California, and is a source of confl  ict between the 
United States and Mexico over saline contamination of the Rio Grande and Colorado rivers. 
Irrigation and intensive agricultural production have caused saline seeps in some of the Western 
states. These occur when water seeps into a slight depression in tilled, sometimes irrigated, fertil-
ized land, carrying salts (particularly sodium, magnesium, and calcium sulfates) along with it. The 
water evaporates in the dry summer heat, leaving behind a salt-laden area that no longer supports 
much plant growth. With time, these areas spread, destroying the productivity of crop land.
7.9 OXYGEN, OXIDANTS, AND REDUCTANTS
Oxygen is a vitally important species in water (see Chapter 2). In water, oxygen is consumed rapidly 
by the oxidation of organic matter, {CH2O}:
 22 2 2Microorganisms{ C HO } O C O HO + ææææææÆ + (7.6)
Unless the water is reaerated effi  ciently, as by turbulent fl  ow in a shallow stream, it rapidly loses 
oxygen and will not support higher forms of aquatic life.
In addition to the microorganism-mediated oxidation of organic matter, oxygen in water may be 
consumed by the biooxidation of nitrogenous material:
 NH4+ + 2O2 Æ 2H+ + NO3- + H2O (7.7)
and by the chemical or biochemical oxidation of chemical reducing agents:
 4Fe2+ + O2 + 10H2O Æ 4Fe(OH)3(s) + 8H+ (7.8)
 2SO32- + O2 Æ 2SO42- (7.9)
All these processes contribute to the deoxygenation of water.

 measured by determining the quantity of oxygen utilized by suitable aquatic microorganisms  during 
a 5-day period.
The addition of oxidizable pollutants to streams produces a typical oxygen sag curve as shown in 
Figure 7 .3. Initially , a well-aerated, unpolluted stream is relatively free of oxidizable material; the 
oxygen level is high; and the bacterial population is relatively low. With the addition of oxidizable 
pollutants, the oxygen level drops because re-aeration cannot keep up with oxygen consumption. In 
the decomposition zone, the bacterial population rises. The septic zone is characterized by a high 
bacterial population and very low oxygen levels. The septic zone terminates when the oxidizable pol-
lutant is exhausted, and then the recovery zone begins. In the recovery zone, the bacterial population 
decreases and the dissolved oxygen level increases until the water regains its original condition.
Although BOD is a reasonably realistic measure of  water quality insofar as oxygen is concerned, 
the test for determining it is time consuming and cumbersome to perform. Total organic carbon 
(TOC) is frequently measured by catalytically oxidizing carbon in the water and measuring the CO2 
that is evolved. It has become popular because TOC is readily determined instrumentally. 170 Environmental Chemistry
7.10 ORGANIC POLLUTANTS
7.10.1 B IOACCUMULATION  OF ORGANIC  POLLUTANTS
An important characteristic of organic water pollutants, especially those that have an affi  nity for lipid 
(fat) tissue and that resist biodegradation, is the bioconcentration factor (BCF), which is defi  ned as 
the ratio of a substance’s concentration in the tissue of an aquatic organism to the concentration of the 
substance in the water where the organism lives. It assumes that exposure is through water only and 
that the concentration in water is stable over a long period of time. A related parameter, the bio-
accumulation factor (BAF) is defi  ned in the same way, except that it assumes that both the organism 
and its food are exposed similarly to a pollutant over a long period of time. Although literally thou-
sands of such factors involving hundreds of species and substances that are taken up by organisms 
from water have been measured or estimated, there is considerable uncertainty in these numbers; 
however, they remain indicative of the pollution potential of persistent organic compounds.2
7.10.2 S EWAGE
As shown in Table 7.4, sewage from domestic, commercial, food-processing, and industrial sources 
contains a wide variety of pollutants, including organic pollutants. Some of these pollutants,

 particularly oxygen-demanding substances (see Section 7.9)—oil, grease, and solids—are removed 
by primary and secondary sewage-treatment processes. Others, such as salts, heavy metals, and 
refractory (degradation-resistant) organics, are not effi  ciently removed.
Disposal of inadequately treated sewage can cause severe problems. For example, offshore 
 disposal of sewage, once commonly practiced by coastal cities, results in the formation of beds of 
sewage residues. Municipal sewage typically contains about 0.1% solids, even after treatment, and 
these settle out in the ocean in a typical pattern, illustrated in Figure 7.4. The warm sewage water 
rises in the cold hypolimnion and is carried in one direction or another by tides or currents. It does 
not rise above the thermocline (metalimnion); instead, it spreads out as a cloud from which the 
 solids rain down on the ocean fl  oor. Aggregation of sewage colloids is aided by dissolved salts in 
seawater (see Chapter 5), thus promoting the formation of sludge-containing sediments.
Another major disposal problem with sewage is the sludge produced as a product of the sewage 
treatment process (see Chapter 8). This sludge contains organic material, which continues to degrade 
slowly; refractory organics; and heavy metals. The amounts of sludge produced are truly staggering. 
For example, the city of Chicago produces about 3 million tons of sludge each year. A major consid-
eration in the safe disposal of such amounts of sludge is the presence of potentially dangerous com-
ponents such as heavy metals.
Careful control of sewage sources is needed to minimize sewage pollution problems. Particularly, 
heavy metals and refractory organic compounds need to be controlled at the source to enable use of sew-
age, or treated sewage effl  uents, for irrigation, recycling to the water system, or groundwater recharge.
Soaps, detergents, and associated chemicals are potential sources of organic pollutants. These 
pollutants are discussed briefl  y here.
7.10.3 S OAPS, DETERGENTS , AND DETERGENT  BUILDERS
7.10.3.1 Soaps
Soaps  are salts of higher fatty acids, such as sodium stearate, C17H35COO-Na+. The cleaning action 
of soap results largely from its emulsifying power and its ability to lower the surface tension of 
water. This concept may be understood by considering the dual nature of the soap anion. An exami-
nation of its structure shows that the stearate ion consists of an ionic carboxyl “head” and a long 
hydrocarbon “tail”:
 O–Na+O
COutfall
pipeThermoclineTreatment
plant
Sediment from sewage Sewage discharge
FIGURE 7.4 Settling of solids from an ocean-fl  oor sewage effl  uent discharge.172 Environmental Chemistry
In the presence of oils, fats, and other water-insoluble organic materials, the tendency is for the 
“tail” of the anion to dissolve in the organic matter, whereas the “head” remains in aquatic solution. 
Thus, the soap emulsifi  es, or suspends, organic material in water. In the process, the anions form 
colloidal soap micelles, as shown in Figure 5.4.
The primary disadvantage of soap as a cleaning agent comes from its reaction with divalent cat-
ions to form insoluble salts of fatty acids:
 2C17H35COO-Na+ + Ca2+ Æ Ca(C17H35CO2)2(s) +  2Na+ (7.10)
These insoluble solids, usually salts of magnesium or calcium, are not at all effective as cleaning 
agents. In addition, the insoluble “curds” form unsightly deposits on clothing and in washing 
machines. If suffi  cient soap is used, all of the divalent cations may be removed by their reaction with 
soap, and the water containing excess soap will have good cleaning qualities. This is the approach 
commonly used when soap is employed with unsoftened water in the bathtub or wash basin, where 
the insoluble calcium and magnesium salts can be tolerated. However, in applications such as wash-
ing clothing, the water must be softened by the removal of calcium and magnesium or their compl-
exation by substances such as polyphosphates (see Section 3.16).
Although the formation of insoluble calcium and magnesium salts has resulted in the essential 
elimination of soap as a cleaning agent for clothing, dishes, and most other materials, it has distinct 
ad v an ta g e s  fro m  th e  e n viro nm e n tal  s tan d po in t.  As  s oo n  as  s o a p  g e ts  in t o  s e w a g e  o r  an  aq ua ti c  
 system, it generally precipitates as calcium and magnesium salts. Hence, any effects that soap might 
have in solution are eliminated. With eventual biodegradation, the soap is completely eliminated 
from the environment. Therefore, aside from the occasional formation of unsightly scum, soap does 
not cause any substantial pollution problems.
7.10.3.2 Detergent s
Synthetic detergents have good cleaning properties and do not form insoluble salts with “hardness 
ions” such as calcium and magnesium. Such synthetic detergents have the additional advantage of 
being the salts of relatively strong acids and, therefore, they do not precipitate out of acidic waters 
as insoluble acids, an undesirable characteristic of soaps. The potential of detergents to contaminate 
water is high because of their heavy use throughout the consumer, institutional, and industrial 
 markets. Over 1 billion pounds of detergent surfactants are consumed annually in the U.S. house-
hold market alone, with slightly more consumed in Europe. Most of this material, along with the 
other ingredients associated with detergent formulations, is discarded with wastewater.
The key ingredient of detergents is the surfactant  or surface-active agent, which acts in effect to 
make water “wetter” and a better cleaning agent. Surfactants concentrate at interfaces of water with 
gases (air), solids (dirt), and immiscible liquids (oil). They do so because of their amphiphilic struc-
ture, meaning that one part of the molecule is a polar or ionic group (head) with a strong affi  nity for 
water, and the other part is a hydrocarbon group (tail) with an aversion to water. This kind of struc-
ture is illustrated below for the molecule of alkyl benzene sulfonate (ABS) surfactant: 
 HHHH
HHH HCO
O–O Na+S CCCCCCCC CH3
CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3HHHHH
Until the early 1960s, ABS was the most common surfactant used in detergent formulations. 
However, it suffered the distinct disadvantage of being only very slowly biodegradable because of its 
branched-chain structure (see Section 6.10). An objectionable manifestation of the nonbiodegradable 
detergents was the “head” of foam that began to appear in glasses of drinking water in areas where 
sewage was recycled through the domestic water supply. Spectacular beds of foam appeared near Water Pollution 173
sewage outfl  ows and in sewage treatment plants and at least one fatality was reported when an indi-
vidual fell in a bed of foam at a sewage treatment plant and was asphyxiated by the gases in the foam. 
Occasionally, the entire aeration tank of an activated sludge plant would be smothered by a blanket 
of foam. Among the other undesirable effects of persistent detergents upon waste-treatment  processes 
were lowered surface tension of water, defl  occulation of colloids, fl  otation of solids, emulsifi  cation of 
grease and oil, and destruction of useful bacteria. Consequently, ABS was replaced by a biodegrad-
able surfactant known as linear alkyl sulfonate (LAS).
LAS, a-benzenesulfonate, has the general structural formula illustrated below where the ben-
zene ring may be attached at any point on the alkyl chain except at the ends:
 HHHHH HHH H HHH
H
HHH HHHHHHHHH
LASCCC CCC CC C CCC
O O
O–+NaS
LAS is more biodegradable than ABS because the alkyl portion of LAS is not branched and does 
not contain the tertiary carbon which is so detrimental to biodegradability. Since LAS has replaced 
ABS in detergents, the problems arising from the surface-active agent in the detergents (such as 
toxicity to fi  sh fi ngerlings) have greatly diminished and the levels of surface-active agents found in 
water have decreased markedly.
Some detergent surfactants are nonionic. One type that has proven troublesome consists of the 
alkyl phenol polyethoxylates:
 H H
HHHHHH
HHHHHCCCCCCCCC CO HO
nNonylphenol polyethoxylateCHHH
HHHH HHH
The alkyl phenol polyethoxylates are very useful as detergents, dispersing agents, emulsifi  ers, 
solubilizers, and wetting agents, leading to annual use of millions of kilograms in the United States. 
These substances and their degradation products in which the polyethoxylate chains have been 
shortened by microbially mediated hydrolysis tend to survive biological sewage treatment and to be 
discharged with the sewage effl  uent. They also accumulate in sewage sludge, much of which is dis-
posed on agricultural lands. These products are thought to be xenoestrogens (estrogen hormone 
mimickers) and their potential entry into the food chain from sludge-treated soil is of concern. 
Because of these concerns, the uses of these compounds have been severely restricted in some 
European countries.
Detergent builders added to detergents to bind to hardness ions, making the detergent solution 
alkaline and greatly improving the action of the detergent surfactant, can cause environmental 
problems. A commercial solid detergent contains only 10–30% surfactant. Detergent formulations 
also contain complexing agents added to complex calcium and to function as builders. Other ingre-
dients include ion exchangers, alkalies (sodium carbonate), anticorrosive sodium silicates, amide 
foam stabilizers, soil-suspending carboxymethylcellulose, bleaches, fabric softeners, enzymes, opti-
cal brighteners, fragrances, dyes, and diluent sodium sulfate. The polyphosphates formerly used in 
builders have caused the most concern as environmental pollutants, although these problems have 
largely been resolved as polyphosphates have been phased out.
Increasing demands on the performance of detergents have led to the use of enzymes in detergent 
formulations destined for both domestic and commercial applications. To a degree, enzymes can 
take the place of chlorine and phosphates, both of which can have detrimental environmental con-
sequences. Lipases and cellulases are the most useful enzymes for detergent applications. 174 Environmental Chemistry
7.10.4 N ATURALLY  OCCURRING  CHLORINATED  AND BROMINATED  COMPOUNDS
Although halogenated organic compounds in water, such as those discussed as pesticides in Section 
7.11, are normally considered to be from anthropogenic sources, more than 2000 such compounds 
have been identifi  ed from natural sources.3 These are produced largely by marine species, espe-
cially some kinds of red algae, probably as chemical defense agents. Some marine microorganisms, 
worms, sponges, and tunicates are also known to produce organochlorine and organobromine com-
pounds. Various ones of these compounds have been detected in samples in Arctic regions including 
air, fi  sh, seabird eggs, marine mammals, and Eskimo women’s milk. An example of such a com-
pound commonly encountered in the marine environment is 1,2 ¢-bi-1H-pyrrole,2,3,3 ¢,4,4¢,5,5¢-
heptachloro-1 ¢-methyl-(C9H3N2Cl7), and its analogous bromine compound:

7.10. 5 M ICROBIAL  TOXINS
Bacteria and protozoa in water can produce toxins that can cause illness or even death. Toxins pro-
duced in rivers, lakes, and reservoirs by cyanobacteria including Anabaena , Microcystis , and 
Nodularia  have caused adverse health effects in Australia, Brazil, England, and elsewhere in the 
world. There are about 40 species of cyanobacteria that produce toxins from six chemical groups. 
Cylindrospermopsin  toxin (below) produced by cyanobacteria has poisoned people who have drunk 
water contaminated by the toxin.

Most of the protozoans that produce toxins belong to the order dinofl  agellata , which are pre-
dominantly marine species. The cells of these organisms are enclosed in cellulose envelopes, which 
often have beautiful patterns on them. Among the effects caused by toxins from these organisms are 
gastrointestinal, respiratory, and skin disorders in humans; mass kills of various marine animals; 
and paralytic conditions caused by eating infested shellfi  sh.
The marine growth of dinofl  agellates is characterized by occasional incidents in which they 
multiply at such an explosive rate that they color the water yellow, olive-green, or red by their vast 
numbers. In 1946, some sections of the Florida coast became so affl  icted by “red tide” that the water 
became viscous and for many miles the beaches were littered with the remains of dead fi  sh, shell-
fi sh, turtles, and other marine organisms. The sea spray in these areas became so irritating that 
coastal schools and resorts were closed.
The greatest danger to humans from dinofl  agellata toxins comes from the ingestion of shellfi  sh, 
such as mussels and clams, that have accumulated the protozoa from sea water. In this form, the 
toxic material is called paralytic shellfi  sh poison. As little as 4 mg of this toxin, the amount found Water Pollution 175
in several severely infested mussels or clams, can be fatal to a human. The toxin depresses respira-
tion and affects the heart, resulting in complete cardiac arrest in extreme cases.
7.11 PESTICIDES IN WATER
The introduction of DDT during World War II marked the beginning of a period of very rapid 
growth in pesticide use. Pesticides are employed for many different purposes. Chemicals used in 
the control of invertebrates include insecticides , molluscicides  for the control of snails and slugs, 
and nematicides  for the control of microscopic roundworms. Vertebrates are controlled by roden-
ticides  that kill rodents, avicides  are used to repel birds, and piscicides  are used in fi  sh control. 
Herbicides  are used to kill plants, particularly weeds in agricultural crops. Plant growth regula-
tors, defoliants , and plant desiccants  are used for various purposes in the cultivation of plants. 
Fungicides are used against fungi, bactericides  against bacteria, slimicides against slime-causing 
organisms in water, and algicides against algae. As of the mid-1990s, U.S. agriculture used about 
365 million kg of pesticides per year, whereas about 900 million kg of insecticides were used in 
nonagricultural applications including forestry, landscaping, gardening, food distribution, and 
home pest control. Insecticide production has remained about level during the last three or four 
decades. However, insecticides and fungicides are the most important pesticides with respect to 
human exposure in food because they are applied shortly before or even after harvesting. Herbicide 
production has increased as chemicals have increasingly replaced cultivation of land in the control 
of weeds and now accounts for the majority of agricultural pesticides. The potential exists for large 
quantities of pesticides to enter water either directly, in applications such as mosquito control or 
indirectly, primarily from drainage of agricultural lands.
Several classes of pesticides and other chemicals are of particular concern as water pollutants 
because of their potential effects. These are (1) highly biodegradation-resistant compounds, (2) 
known or probable carcinogens, (3) toxicants with adverse reproductive or developmental effects, 
(4) neurotoxins including cholinesterase inhibitors, (5) substances with high acute toxicities, and (6) 
known groundwater contaminants. Table 7.5 lists some of the most commonly used pesticides that 
may be of concern as water pollutants.
Degradation (often hydrolysis) products of some pesticides are encountered in water at levels 
similar to, or even higher than, the parent pesticides. In some cases, the degradation products are 
more toxic than the parent pesticides. An example of a pesticide degradation product commonly 
found in water is aminomethyl phosphonic acid produced from herbicidal glyphosate (Figure 7.13) 
which, under the brand name of Roundup, is the most widely produced pesticide in the world.
7.11.1 N ATURAL  PRODUCT  INSECTICIDES , PYRETHRINS , AND PYRETHROIDS
Plants provide several signifi  cant classes of insecticides including nicotine  from tobacco, rotenone  
from certain legume roots, and pyrethrins  ( see structural formulas in Figure 7 .5). Because of the 
ways in which they are applied and their biodegradabilities, these substances are unlikely to be 
signifi  cant water pollutants.
Pyrethrins and their synthetic analogs represent both the oldest and newest of insecticides. 
Extracts of dried chrysanthemum or pyrethrum fl  owers, which contain pyrethrin I and related com-
pounds, have been known for their insecticidal properties for a long time, and may have even been 
used as botanical insecticides in China almost 2000 years ago. The most important commercial 
sources of insecticidal pyrethrins are chrysanthemum varieties grown in Kenya. Pyrethrins have 
several advantages as insecticides, including facile enzymatic degradation, which makes them 
 relatively safe for mammals; ability to rapidly paralyze (“knock down”) fl  ying insects; and good 
biodegradability characteristics.
Synthetic analogs of the pyrethrins, pyrethroids ,  h a v e  b e e n  w i d e l y  p r o d u c e d  a s  i n s e c t i c i d e s  
 during recent years. The fi  rst of these was allethrin, and another common example is fenvalerate 176 Environmental Chemistry

7.11.2 DDT AND ORGANOCHLORINE  INSECTICIDES
Chlorinated hydrocarbon or organochlorine insecticides are hydrocarbon compounds in which vari-
ous numbers of hydrogen atoms have been replaced by Cl atoms (Figure 7.6). Of the organochlorine 
insecticides, the most notable has been DDT, which was used in massive quantities following World 
War II. It has a low acute toxicity to mammals, although there is some evidence that it might be FIGURE 7.5 Common botanical insecticides and synthetic analogs of the pyrethrins.NN

carcinogenic. It is a very persistent insecticide and accumulates in food chains. It has been banned 
in the United States since 1972.
Many organochlorine insecticides were widely used in past decades but are now banned because 
of their toxicities, and particularly their accumulation and persistence in food chains. Now largely 
of historical interest, these include methoxychlor (once a popular replacement for DDT), dieldrin, 
endrin, chlordane, aldrin, dieldrin/endrin, heptachlor, toxaphene, lindane, and endosulfan (one of 
the last to be phased out of general use).
7.11.3 O RGANOPHOSPHATE  INSECTICIDES
Organophosphate insecticides  are insecticidal organic compounds that contain phosphorus, some 
of which are organic esters of orthophosphoric acid, such as paraoxon:
 O
P O NO2C2H5O
C2H5O
More commonly, insecticidal phosphorus comp ounds are phosphorothionate and phosphorodi-
thioate compounds, such as those shown in Figure 7.7, which have an =S group rather than an =O 
group bonded to P.
The toxicities of organophosphate insecticides vary a great deal. Their major toxic effect is the 
inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme essential for nerve function. For example, as little as 
120 mg of parathion has been known to kill an adult human, and a dose of 2 mg has killed a child. 
Most accidental poisonings have occurred by absorption through the skin. Since its use began, 
 several hundred people have been killed by parathion. In contrast, malathion  shows how differences 
in structural formula can cause pronounced differences in the properties of organophosphate pesti-
cides. Malathion has two carboxyester linkages, which are hydrolyzable by carboxylase enzymes to 
relatively nontoxic products as shown by the following reaction:

The enzymes that accomplish malathion hydrolysis are possessed by mammals, but not by 
insects, so mammals can detoxify malathion, whereas insects cannot. The result is that malathion 
has selective insecticidal activity. For example, although malathion is a very effective insecticide, 
its LD50 (dose required to kill 50% of test subjects) for adult male rats is about 100 times that of 
parathion, refl  ecting the much lower mammalian toxicity of malathion compared to some of the 
more toxic organophosphate insecticides, such as parathion.
Unlike the organohalide compounds they largely displaced, the organophosphates readily 
undergo biodegradation and do not bioaccumulate. Because of their high biodegradability and 
restricted use, organophosphates are of comparatively little signifi  cance as water pollutants.
7.11.4 C ARBAMATES
Pesticidal organic derivatives of carbamic acid, for which the formula is shown in Figure 7.8, are 
known collectively as carbamates . Carbamate pesticides have been widely used because some are 
more biodegradable than the formerly popular organochlorine insecticides, and have lower dermal 
toxicities than most common organophosphate pesticides.
Carbaryl has been widely used as an insecticide on lawns or gardens. It has a low toxicity to mam-
mals. Carbofuran  has a high water solubility and acts as a plant systemic insecticide. As a plant 
systemic insecticide, it is taken up by the roots and leaves of plants so that insects are poisoned by 
the plant material on which they feed. Pirimicarb  has been widely used in agriculture as a systemic 
aphicide. Unlike many carbamates, it is rather persistent, with a strong tendency to bind to soil.
Carbamates are toxic to animals because they inhibit acetylcholinesterase. Unlike some of the 
organophosphate insecticides, they do so without the need for undergoing a prior biotransformation 
and are therefore classifi  ed as direct inhibitors. Their inhibition of acetylcholinesterase is relatively 
reversible. Loss of acetylcholinesterase inhibition activity may result from hydrolysis of the carba-
mate ester, which can occur metabolically.
7.11. 5 F UNGICIDES
Fungicides are widely applied to cereal and food crops to prevent fungal infections of these crops. 
Because of this, fungicides have the potential to contaminate water. Structural formulas of three 
commonly used fungicides are shown in Figure 7 .9 . Of the ones shown, chlorothalonil has been 
used for more than 30 years with annual applications in the United States of more than 5 million kg. 
It is typically applied at a rate of 1 kg per hectare per application with 4–9 applications per year. The 
strobilurin fungicides exemplifi  e d  b y  a z o x y s t r o b i n  a n d  t h e  t r i a z o l e  f u n g i c i d e s  e x e m p l i fi  ed by

7.11.6 H ERBICIDES
Herbicides are applied over millions of acres of farmland worldwide and are widespread water pol-
lutants as a result of this intensive use. Herbicides are commonly found in surface water and ground-
water. Among those commonly encountered in surface water and groundwater are atrazine, simazine, 
and cyanazine widely used to control weeds on corn and soybeans in the “Corn Belt” states of 
Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri as well as agricultural regions throughout the world. 
Other herbicides found in water include prometon, metolachlor, metribuzin, tebuthiuron, trifl  uran, 
alachlor, and the atrazine metabolites deisopropylatrazine and deethylatrazine. Although glyphosate 
is a very widely used herbicide to control weeds on crops genetically engineered to resist its effects, 
it is rarely found at levels of concern in water because of its very strong affi  nity for soil solids.
7.11.6.1 Bipyridilium Compounds
As shown by the structures in Figure 7.10, a bipyridilium compound contains two pyridine rings per 
molecule. The two important pesticidal compounds of this type are the herbicides diquat  and para-
quat, the structural formulas of which are illustrated in Figure 7.11.
Other members of this class of herbicides include chlormequat, morfamquat, and difenzoquat. 
Applied directly to the plant tissue, these compounds rapidly destroy plant cells and give the plant 
a frostbitten appearance. However, they bind tenaciously to soil, especially the clay mineral frac-
tion, which results in rapid loss of herbicidal activity so that sprayed fi  elds can be planted within a 
day or two of herbicide application.
Paraquat, which was registered for use in 1965, has been one of the most used of the bipyridilium 
herbicides. Highly toxic, it is reputed to have “been responsible for hundreds of human deaths.” 4 
Exposure to fatal or dangerous levels of paraquat can occur by all pathways, including inhalation of 
spray, skin contact, ingestion, and even suicidal hypodermic injections. Despite these possibilities 
and its widespread application, paraquat is used safely without ill effects when proper procedures 
are followed.
Because of its widespread use as a herbicide, the possibility exists of substantial paraquat con-
tamination of food. Drinking water contamination by paraquat has also been observed.FIGURE 7.9 Four examples of widely used fungicides that may be of concern as potential water pollutants.Cl

7.11.6.2 Herbicidal Heterocyclic Nitrogen Compounds
A number of important herbicides contain three heterocyclic nitrogen atoms in ring structures and 
are therefore called triazines  (Figure 7.11). Triazine herbicides inhibit photosynthesis. Selectivity is 
gained by the inability of target plants to metabolize and detoxify the herbicide. The most long 
established and common example of this class is atrazine, commonly applied to kill weeds in corn, 
and a widespread water pollutant in corn-growing regions. Another member of this class is 
metribuzin, which is widely used on soybeans, sugarcane, and wheat.
7.11.6.3 Chlorophenoxy Herbicides
The chlorophenoxy herbicides, including 2,4-D and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) 
shown in Figure 7.12, were manufactured on a large scale for weed and brush control and as military 
defoliants. At one time the latter was of particular concern because of contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetra-
chlorodibenzo- p-dioxin (TCDD) (see fi  gures) present as a manufacturing by-product.
7.11.6.4 Miscellaneous Herbicides
Many herbicides that are environmentally signifi  cant do not fall into the classifi  cations described 
above. The most commonly used of these that are likely to be encountered as water pollutants are 
shown in Figure 7.13.
Nitroaniline herbicides are characterized by the presence of NO2 and a substituted –NH2 group on 
a benzene ring as shown for trifl  uralin. This class of herbicides is widely represented in agricultural FIGURE 7.11 Triazine herbicides. These compounds are commonly encountered as water pollutants in

A wide variety of chemicals have been used as herbicides, and have been potential water pollut-
ants. One such compound is R-mecoprop (Figure 7.13). Other types of herbicides include substituted 
ureas, carbamates, and thiocarbamates.
Until about 1960, arsenic trioxide and other inorganic arsenic compounds (see Section 7.4) were 
employed to kill weeds. Because of the incredibly high rates of application of up to several hundred 
kilograms per acre, and because arsenic is nonbiodegradable, the potential still exists for arsenic 
pollution of surface water and groundwater from fi  elds formerly dosed with inorganic arsenic. 
Organic arsenicals, such as cacodylic acid, have also been widely applied to kill weeds:

dibenzodioxins . From 1 to 8 Cl atoms may be substituted for H atoms on dibenzo- p-dioxin (Figure 7.14), 
giving a total of 75 possible chlorinated derivatives. Commonly referred to as “dioxins,” these species 
have a high environmental and toxicological signifi  cance. Of the dioxins, the most notable pollutant and 
hazardous waste compound is TCDD, often referred to simply as “ dioxin . ” This compound was pro-
duced as a low-level contaminant in the manufacture of some aryl, oxygen-containing organohalide 
compounds such as chl oropheno xy herbicides ( menti oned pre vi ousl y in this secti on ) synthesized b y 
processes used until the 1960s.
TCDD has a very low vapor pressure, a high melting point of 305°C, and a water solubility of 
only 0.2 μg/L. It is chemically unreactive, stable thermally up to about 700°C, and is poorly biode-
gradable. It is very toxic to some animals, with an LD50 of only about 0.6 μg/kg body mass in male 
guinea pigs. (The type and degree of its toxicity to humans are largely unknown; it is known to 
cause a severe skin condition called chloracne.) Because of its properties, TCDD is a stable, persis-
tent environmental pollutant and a hazardous waste constituent of considerable concern. It has been 
identifi  ed in some municipal incineration emissions, in which it is believed to form when chlorine 
from the combustion of organochlorine compounds reacts with carbon in the incinerator. 
TCDD contamination has resulted from improper waste disposal, the most notable case of which 
resulted from the spraying of waste oil mixed with TCDD on roads and horse arenas in Missouri in 
the early 1970s. Contamination of the soil in Times Beach, Missouri, resulted in the whole town 
being bought out and its topsoil dug up and incinerated at a cost exceeding $100 million.
One of the greater environmental disasters ever to result from pesticide manufacture involved the 
production of Kepone, structural formula
 O
(Cl)10
This pesticide has been used for the control of banana-root borer, tobacco wireworm, ants, and 
cockroaches. Kepone exhibits acute, delayed, and cumulative toxicity in birds, rodents, and humans, 
and it causes cancer in rodents. It was manufactured in Hopewell, Virginia, during the mid-1970s. 
During this time, workers were exposed to Kepone and are alleged to have suffered health problems 
as a result. As much as 53,000 kg of kepone may have been dumped through the sewage system of 
Hopewell and into the James River. The cost of dredging the river to remove this waste was esti-
mated at a prohibitive cost of several  billion dollars.
7.12 POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS
First discovered as environmental pollutants in 1966, PCB  compounds have been found throughout 
the world in water, sediments, bird tissue, and fi  sh tissue. These compounds constitute an important FIGURE 7.14 Dibenzo- p-dioxin and TCDD, often called simply “dioxin.” In the structure of dibenzo- p-
dioxin, each number refers to a numbered carbon atom to which an H atom is bound, and the names of deriva-
tives are based upon the carbon atoms where another group has been substituted for the H atoms, as is seen by 
the structure and name of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p-dioxin.Dibenzo- p-dioxin 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-

class of special wastes. They are made by substituting from 1 to 10 Cl atoms onto the biphenyl aryl 
structure as shown on the left in Figure 7.15. This substitution can produce 209 different compounds 
(congeners), of which one example is shown on the right in Figure 7.15.
Polychlorinated biphenyls have very high chemical, thermal, and biological stability; low vapor 
pressure; and high dielectric constants. These properties have led to the use of PCBs as coolant-
insulation fl  uids in transformers and capacitors; for the impregnation of cotton and asbestos; as 
plasticizers; and as additives to some epoxy paints. The same properties that made extraordinarily 
stable PCBs so useful also contributed to the widespread dispersion and accumulation of these sub-
stances in the environment. By regulations issued in the United States under the authority of the 
Toxic Substances Control Act passed in 1976, the manufacture of PCBs was discontinued in the 
United States, and their uses and disposal were strictly controlled. Some degree of biodegradation 
of PCBs in the environment does occur.5
Substi tutes f or PCB s f or electrical applicati ons ha v e been de v eloped. Disposal of PCB s from 
discarded electrical equipment and other sources have caused problems, particularly since PCBs 
can survive ordinary incineration by escaping as vapors through the smokestack. However, they can 
be destroyed by special incineration processes.
PCBs are especially prominent pollutants in the sediments of the Hudson River as a result of 
waste discharges from two capacitor manufacturing plants that operated about 60 km upstream 
from the southernmost dam on the river from 1950 to 1976. The river sediments downstream from 
the plants exhibit PCB levels of about 10 ppm, 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than levels com-
monly encountered in river and estuary sediments. In 2002, General Electric Co. was ordered to 
dredge and decontaminate sections of the Hudson River polluted with PCBs at a cost exceeding 
$100 million. As of 2009, the actual cleanup was barely underway.
7.13  EMERGING WATER POLLUTANTS, PHARMACEUTICALS, 
AND HOUSEHOLD WASTES
The continued development of new products used for various purposes has led to interest in emerg-
ing pollutants of various kinds which may be of concern in water. Prominent among these are 
nanomaterials  consisting of very small entities in the 1–100 nm size range. Nanomaterials of vari-
ous kinds have unique properties of high thermal stability, low permeability, high strength, and 
high conductivity. These and other properties are leading to uses in electronics, automobiles, 
apparel, sunscreens, cosmetics, water purifi  cation, and other products. It is anticipated that the use 
of nanomaterials in drug delivery will increase rapidly in the future. The commercial uses of nano-
materials are in their infancy, but very rapid growth is underway. Little is known about the potential 
pollution effects and toxicities of nanomaterials, so their potential effects as water pollutants are of 
signifi  cant concern.
Another class of emerging pollutants consists of siloxanes  (commonly called silicones) including 
octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, and dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane. 
Siloxanes are thermally and chemically very stable leading to their uses as coolants in transformers, 
protective encapsulating materials in semiconductors, lubricants, coatings, and sealants. Siloxanes 
are widely used in personal care products including deodorants, cosmetics, soaps, hair conditioners, FIGURE 7.15 General formula of polychlorinated biphenyls (left, where X may range from 1 to 10) and a

and hair dyes and other products such as water repellent windshield coatings, detergent antifoaming 
agents, and even food additives. Siloxanes are resistant to biodegradation and as a result are encoun-
tered in water that has received wastewater.

Disinfection by-products are of some concern as water pollutants. These are compounds contain-
ing halogens and nitrogen that result from reactions of water disinfectants including chlorine, 
hypochlorite, and chlorine dioxide. In addition to exposure in drinking water, humans may be exposed 
to these substances through skin contact in bathing or swimming and as vapors emitted from water 
during showers. Brominated and iodated compounds are formed in chlorinated water by reactions of 
bromide or iodide in the water, usually present in areas of seawater or saline ground water intrusion.
The most common disinfection by-products are the trihalomethanes —chloroform (CHCl3), dibromo-
chloromethane (CHClBr2), bromodichloromethane (CHCl2Br), and tribromomethane (CHBr3). These 
are all by-products of water chlorination and are Group B carcinogens (shown to cause cancer in 
laboratory animals). By far the most abundant of these in water systems is trichloromethane 
 ( c hl o r o f o rm ) .  D i b r o m o c hl o r o m e t h an e  i s  r e g ar d e d  a s  p o s i n g  a b o u t  1 0  t i m e s  t h e  ri s k  o f  c an c e r  a s  
 chloroform, and tribromomethane is thought to pose just a slightly greater cancer risk than chloroform. 
As of 2009, the maximum allowable limit for total trihalomethanes in drinking water was 100 μg/L.
Various substances associated with household wastes are found in water, especially in treated 
sewage discharges. These materials include steroids, surfactants, fl  ame retardants, fragrances, plas-
ticizers, and pharmaceuticals and their metabolites. It should be noted that, although signifi  cant 
numbers of such compounds are found, they are generally at subpart-per-billion levels and are 
d e t e c t a b l e  o n l y  b y  t h e  r e m a r k a b l e  c a p a b i l i t y  o f  m o d e r n  a n a l y t i c a l  i n s t r u m e n t a t i o n .  A  s t u d y  o f  
“exotic” organics found in groundwater and water supplies6 detected a variety of substances includ-
ing cholesterol, nicotine metabolite cotinine, b-sitosterol (a natural plant sterol), 1,7-dimethyl-
xanthine (caffeine metabolite), bisphenol-A plasticizer, and fi  re retardant (2-chloroethyl) phosphate.
Pharmaceutical compounds and their partial degradation products are discharged with sewage as 
wastes from human ingestion and from being discarded with wastewater.7 The quantities of these 
substances in sewage in developed countries can reach of the order of 100 metric tons per year. 
Levels of common pharmaceuticals of around 1 μg/L have been observed in river water. Although 
these are relatively low values, they are of some concern because of the biological activity inherent 
to pharmaceutical products, which are increasingly designed for higher potency, bioavailability, and 
resistance to degradation. Figure 7.16 shows some of the most common pharmaceuticals and their 
degradation products that have been observed in water.
The most obvious effect of pharmaceuticals and their metabolic products in water has been the 
f e m i n i z a t i o n  o f  m a l e  fi  sh observed downstream from treated sewage discharges resulting from 
estrogenic compounds in wastewater. First noted in England and later in the United States and 
Europe, these male fi  sh have been observed to produce proteins associated with egg production by 
female fi  sh and to produce early-stage eggs in their testes. These effects are largely attributed to 
residues of synthetic 17 a-ethinylestradiol and the natural hormone 17 b-estradiol, used in oral con-
traceptives. The glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of 17 a-ethinylestradiol (see Chapter 23 for a 
discussion of conjugates formed metabolically) are excreted with urine and cleaved by bacteria in 
water to regenerate the original compound.186 Environmental Chemistry

methyl derivative have been found in natural waters in Switzerland.8
7.13.2 E STROGENIC  SUBSTANCES  IN WASTEWATER  EFFLUENTS
A class of water pollutants of particular concern commonly found in sewage and even treated sew-
age effl  uent are estrogenic substances  that can disrupt the crucial endocrine gland activities that 
regulate the metabolism and reproductive functions of organisms (Section 22.8). Aquatic organ-
isms including fi  sh, frogs, and reptiles such as alligators exposed to such substances may exhibit 
reproductive  dysfunction, alterations in secondary sex characteristics, and abnormal serum steroid 
levels. Such substances include exogenous estrogenic substances among which are 17 a-ethynyl 
estradiol, diethylstilbestrol, mestranol, levonorgestrel, and norethindrone used in oral contracep-
tives, treatment of hormonal disorders, and cancer treatment. Some synthetic substances also act 
as estrogen disruptors. Of prime concern as water pollutants are nonionic surfactant polyethoxy-
lates, mentioned in the discussion of detergents above, and their major degradation product, persis-
tent nonylphenol. Although these substances are orders of magnitude less potent than hormonal 
substances, annual usage of  millions of kilograms of nonionic surfactants make them a signifi  cant 
factor as water pollutants.
7.13.3 B IOREFRACTORY  ORGANIC  POLLUTANTS
Millions of tons of organic compounds are manufactured globally each year. Signifi  cant quantities of 
several thousand such compounds appear as water pollutants. Most of these compounds, particularly FIGURE 7.16 Pharmaceuticals and metabolites of concern as water pollutants.O

the less biodegradable ones, are substances to which living organisms have not been exposed until 
recent years. Often, their effects on organisms are not known, particularly for long-term exposures at 
very low levels. The potential exists for synthetic organics to cause genetic damage, cancer, or other 
ill effects. On the positive side, organic pesticides enable a level of agricultural productivity without 
which millions would starve. Synthetic organic chemicals are increasingly taking the place of natural 
products in short supply. Thus it is seen that organic chemicals are essential for the operation of a 
modern society. Because of their potential danger, however, acquisition of knowledge about their 
environmental chemistry must have a high priority.
Biorefractory organics  are the organic compounds of most concern in wastewater, particularly 
when they are found in sources of drinking water. These are poorly biodegradable substances and 
are sometimes referred to as persistent organic pollutants (POP), prominent among which are aryl 
or chlorinated hydrocarbons. Biorefractory compounds that may be found in water include benzene, 
chloroform, methyl chloride, styrene, tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethane, and toluene. In addition 
to their potential toxicity, biorefractive compounds can cause taste and odor problems in water. 
They are not completely removed by biological treatment, and water contaminated with these com-
pounds must be treated by physical and chemical means, including air stripping, solvent extraction, 
ozonation, and carbon adsorption.

was once used as a gasoline octane booster, but was phased out after it appeared as a low-level water 
pollutant in the United States. Levels of this chemical in recreational lakes and reservoirs were 
attributed largely to emissions of unburned fuel from recreational motorboats and personal water-
craft having two-cycle engines that discharge their exhausts directly to the water.
Perfl uorinated organic compounds constitute a unique class of POPs. They occur as completely 
fl uorinated hydrocarbon derivatives, such as CF4, in the atmosphere, where they are regarded as 
atmospheric pollutants and potential greenhouse gases (see Section 12.7). Other perfl  uorinated 
compounds that are organic acids or their salts have been encountered as water pollutants. Most 
commonly cited are salts of perfl  uorooctane sulfonic acid; others include salts of perfl  uorinated 
carboxylic acids, such as perfl  uorohexanoic acid:

Perfl uorocarbons have been used commercially since the 1950s, primarily as coatings to resist 
soil and grease in paper products, fabrics, carpet material, and leather. Scotchgard fabric protector, 
once manufactured by 3M Corporation, contained perfl  uorooctane sulfonates, but this use has been 
discontinued. Perfl  uorocarbons have also been used as surfactants in oil drilling fl  uids and fi  refi ght-
ing foams. Other applications have included alkaline cleaners, fl  oor polish formulations, etching 
baths, and even denture cleaners. Perfl  uorocarbons have been detected in water, fi  sh blood and liver, 
and human blood.
Brominated compounds have been recognized as signifi  cant environmental and water pollutants 
in recent years and have even been found in mothers’ milk in some countries. These compounds 
ha v e been man uf actured as fl  ame retardants, largely for use in polymers and textiles. The most 188 Environmental Chemistry

Benzotriazole and tolyltriazoles (structural formulas below) are complexing agents for metals 
that are widely used as anticorrosive additives by forming a thin complexing fi  lm on metal surfaces, 
thereby protecting the metal from corrosion. These compounds are used in a variety of products 
including hydraulic fl  uids, cooling fl  uids, antifreeze formulations, and aircraft deicer fl  uids, and for 
silver protection in dishwasher detergents. Because of these uses, the triazoles are commonly 
encountered as “down-the-drain” chemicals that get into wastewaters. Their widespread use, high 
water solubility, and poor biodegradability make them among the most widely encountered chemi-
cals in waters receiving treated wastewater.9

Naphthenic acid  is a complex and variable mixture of carboxylic acids of molar masses in the 
approximate range of 180–350 and typically containing one –CO2H group and one 5- or 6- membered 
ring per molecule that is a by-product of petroleum refi  ning. Naphthenic acids recovered from petro-
leum refi  ning are used for solvents, lubricants, corrosion inhibitors, metal naphthenate synthesis, 
fuel additives, deicing, dust control, wood preservation, and road stabilization. Water pollution from 
naphthenic acids is most severe in the tar sands processing area of Alberta, Canada, where caustic 
hot water is used to wash heavy hydrocarbon crude oil from sand, leaving huge quantities of tailings 
of clay, sand, and water contaminated with 80–120 mg/L naphthenic acids. The acids are toxic to 
aquatic organisms and are endocrine disrupting substances.

World War II has been accompanied by increasing concern about the effects of radioactivity on health 
and the environment. Radionuclides are produced as fi  ssion products of heavy nuclei of elements such 
as uranium or plutonium. They are also produced by the reaction of neutrons with stable nuclei. These Water Pollution 189
phenomena are illustrated in Figure 7.17 and specifi  c examples are given in Table 7.6. Radionuclides 
are formed in large quantities as waste products in nuclear power generation. Their ultimate disposal 
is a problem that has caused much controversy regarding the widespread use of nuclear power. 
Artifi  cially produced radionuclides are also widely used in industrial and medical applications, 
 particularly as “tracers.” With so many possible sources of radionuclides, it is impossible to entirely

eliminate radioactive contamination of aquatic systems. Furthermore, radionuclides may enter aquatic 
systems from natural sources. Therefore, the transpor t, reactions and biological concentration of radio-
nuclides in aquatic ecosystems are of great importance to the environmental chemist.
Radionuclides differ from other nuclei in that they emit ionizing radiation —alpha particles, beta 
particles, and gamma rays. The most massive of these emissions is the alpha particle , a helium 
nucleus of atomic mass 4, consisting of two neutrons and two protons. The symbol for an alpha 
particle is 4
2a. An example of alpha production is found in the radioactive decay of uranium-238:
 238 234 4
92 90 2UT hÆ+ a (7.12)
This transformation occurs when a uranium nucleus, atomic number 92 and atomic mass 238, loses 
an alpha particle, atomic number 2 and atomic mass 4, to yield a thorium nucleus, atomic number 
90 and atomic mass 234.
Beta radiation consists of either highly energetic, negative electrons, which are designated 0
1-b, 
or positive electrons, called positrons, and designated 0
1b. A typical beta emitter, chlorine-38, may 
be produced by irradiating chlorine with neutrons. The chlorine-37 nucleus, natural abundance 
24.5%, absorbs a neutron to produce chlorine-38 and gamma radiation:
 37 1 38
17 0 17Cl n Cl+Æ + g (7.13)
The chlorine-38 nucleus is radioactive and loses a negative beta particle  to become an argon-38 
nucleus:
 38 38 0
17 18 1Cl Ar- Æ+ b (7.14)
Since the negative beta particle has essentially no mass and a -1 charge, the stable product isotope, 
argon-38, has the same mass and a charge 1 greater than chlorine-38.
Gamma rays  are electromagnetic radiation similar to x-rays, though more energetic. Since the 
energy of gamma radiation is often a well-defi  ned property of the emitting nucleus, it may be used 
in some cases for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of radionuclides.
The primary effect of alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays on materials is the produc-
tion of ions; therefore, they are called ionizing radiation . Due to their large size, alpha particles do 
not penetrate matter deeply, but cause an enormous amount of ionization along their short path of 
penetration. Therefore, alpha particles present little hazard outside the body, but are very dangerous 
when ingested. Although beta particles are more penetrating than alpha particles, they produce 
much less ionization per unit path length. Gamma rays are much more penetrating than particulate 
radiation, but cause much less ionization. Their degree of penetration is proportional to their 
energy.
The decay  of a specifi  c radionuclide follows fi  rst-order kinetics; that is, the number of nuclei 
disintegrating in a short time interval is directly proportional to the number of radioactive nuclei 
present. The rate of decay, -dN/dt, is given by the equation
 dDecay rated== lNNt  (7.15)
where N is the number of radioactive nuclei present and l is the rate constant, which has units of 
reciprocal time. Since the exact number of disintegrations per second is diffi  cult to determine in 
the laboratory, radioactive decay is often described in terms of the measured activity , A, which is Water Pollution 191
proportional to the absolute rate of decay. The fi  rst-order decay equation may be expressed in terms 
of A:
 A  = A0e-lt (7.16)
where A is the activity at time t, A0 is the activity when t is zero, and e is the natural logarithm base. 
The half-life , t1/2, is generally used instead of l to characterize a radionuclide:
 1/20.693=lt
 (7.17)
As the term implies, a half-life is the period of time during which half of a given number of atoms 
of a specifi  c kind of radionuclide decay. Ten half-lives are required for the loss of 99.9% of the activ-
ity of a radionuclide.
Radiation damages living organisms by initiating harmful chemical reactions in tissues. For 
example, bonds are broken in the macromolecules that carry out life processes. In cases of acute 
radiation poisoning, bone marrow, which produces red blood cells, is destroyed and the concentra-
tion of red blood cells is diminished. Radiation-induced genetic damage is of great concern. Such 
damage may not become apparent until many years after exposure. As humans have learned more 
about the effects of ionizing radiation, the dosage level considered to be safe has steadily dimin-
ished. For example, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has dropped the maximum permis-
sible concentration of some radioisotopes to levels of less than one ten-thousandth of those considered 
safe in the early 1950s. Although it is possible that even the slightest exposure to ionizing radiation 
entails some damage, some radiation is unavoidably received from natural sources including the 
radioactive 40K found in all humans. For the majority of the population, exposure to natural radi-
ation exceeds that from artifi  cial sources.
The study of the ecological and health effects of radionuclides involves consideration of many 
factors. Among these are the type and energy of radiation emitter and the half-life of the source. In 
addition, the degree to which the particular element is absorbed by living species and the chemical 
interactions and transport of the element in aquatic ecosystems are important factors. Radionuclides 
having very short half-lives may be hazardous when produced but decay too rapidly to affect the 
environment into which they are introduced. Radionuclides with very long half-lives may be quite 
persistent in the environment but of such low activity that little environmental damage is caused. 
Therefore, in general, radionuclides with intermediate half-lives are the most dangerous. They per-
sist long enough to enter living systems while still retaining a high activity. Because they may be 
incorporated within living tissue, radionuclides of “life elements” are particularly dangerous. Much 
concern has been expressed over strontium-90, a common waste product of nuclear testing. This 
element is interchangeable with calcium in bone. Strontium-90 fallout drops onto pasture and 
 cropland and is ingested by cattle. Eventually, it enters the bodies of infants and children by way of 
cow’s milk.
Some radionuclides found in water, primarily radium and potassium-40, originate from natural 
sources, particularly leaching from minerals. Others come from pollutant sources, primarily nuclear 
power plants and testing of nuclear weapons. The levels of radionuclides found in water typically are 
measured in units of pCi/L (picocuries per liter), where a curie is 3.7 ¥ 1010 disintegrations per 
 second, and a pCi is 1 ¥ 10-12 that amount, or 3.7 ¥ 10-2 disintegrations per second (2.2 disintegra-
tions per minute).
The radionuclide of most concern in drinking water is radium , Ra. Areas in the United States 
where signifi  cant radium contamination of water has been observed include the uranium-producing 
regions of the western United States, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, Minnesota, Florida, North 
Carolina, Virginia, and the New England states.192 Environmental Chemistry
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency specifi  es maximum contaminant levels (MCL) for 
total radium (226Ra + 228Ra) in drinking water in units of pCi/L. In the past, perhaps as many as 
 sev eral hundred municipal water supplies in the United States have exceeded permissible levels, which 
has required fi  nding alternative sources or additional treatment to remove radium. Fortunately, con-
ventional water softening processes, which are designed to take out excessive levels of calcium, are 
relatively effi  cient in removing radium from water.
The possible contamination of water by fi  ssion-product radioisotopes from nuclear power pro-
duction is of some concern. (If nations continue to refrain from testing nuclear weapons above 
ground, it is hoped that radioisotopes from this source will contribute only minor amounts of radio-
activity to water.) Table 7.6 summarizes the major natural and artifi  cial radionuclides likely to be 
encountered in water.
Transuranic elements are also of concern in the oceanic environment. These alpha emitters are 
long-lived and highly toxic. Included among these elements are various isotopes of neptunium, plu-
tonium, americium, and curium. Specifi  c isotopes, with half-lives in years given in parentheses, are 
Np-237 (2.14 ¥ 106), Pu-236 (2.85), Pu-238 (87.8), Pu-239 (2.44 ¥ 104), Pu-240 (6.54 ¥ 103), Pu-241 
(15), Pu-242 (3.87 × 105), Am-241 (433), Am-243 (7.37 ¥ 106), Cm-242 (0.22), and Cm-244 (17.9).

8.1 WATER TREATMENT AND WATER USE
The treatment of water may be divided into three major categories:
Purifi  cation for domestic use • 
Treatment for specialized industrial applications• 
Treatment of wastewater to make it acceptable for release or reuse• 
The type and degree of treatment are strongly dependent upon the source and intended use of the 
water. Water for domestic use must be thoroughly disinfected to eliminate disease-causing micro-
organisms, but may contain appreciable levels of dissolved calcium and magnesium (hardness). 
Water to be used in boilers may contain bacteria but must be quite soft to prevent scale formation. 
Wastewater being discharged into a large river may require less rigorous treatment than water to be 
reused in an arid region. As world demand for limited water resources grows, more sophisticated 
and extensive means will have to be employed to treat water.
Most physical and chemical processes used to treat water involve similar phenomena, regardless 
of their application to the three main categories of water treatment listed above. Therefore, after 
introductions to water treatment for municipal use, industrial use, and disposal, each major kind of 
treatment process is discussed as it applies to all of these applications.
8.2 MUNICIPAL WATER TREATMENT
The modern water treatment plant is often called upon to perform wonders with the water fed to it. 
The clear, safe, even tasteful water that comes from a faucet may have started as a murky liquid 
pumped from a polluted river laden with mud and swarming with bacteria. Or, its source may have 
bee n  w e ll  w a te r ,  m u c h  too  har d  f o r  d o m es ti c  u se  an d  co n tainin g  hi gh  l e v e l s  o f  s tain - prod u cin g  
 dissolved iron and manganese. The water treatment plant operator’s job is to make sure that the 
water plant product presents no hazards to the consumer.
A schematic diagram of a typical municipal water treatment plant is shown in Figure 8.1. This 
particular facility treats water containing excessive hardness and a high level of iron. The raw water 
taken from wells fi  rst goes to an aerator. Contact of the water with air removes volatile solutes such as 
hydrogen sulfi  de, carbon dioxide, methane, and volatile odorous substances such as methane thiol 
(CH3SH) and bacterial metabolites. Contact with oxygen also aids iron removal by oxidizing soluble 
iron(II) to insoluble iron(III). The addition of lime as CaO or Ca(OH)2 after aeration raises the pH and 
results in the formation of precipitates containing the hardness ions Ca2+ and Mg2+. These precipitates 
settle from the water in a primary basin. Much of the solid material remains in suspension and requires 
the addition of coagulants [such as iron(III) and aluminum sulfates, which form gelatinous metal 
hydroxides] to settle the colloidal particles. Activated silica or synthetic polyelectrolytes may also be 
added to stimulate coagulation or fl  occulation. The settling occurs in a secondary basin after the addi-
tion of carbon dioxide to lower the pH. Sludge from both the primary and secondary basins is pumped 
to a sludge lagoon. The water is fi  nally chlorinated, fi  ltered, and pumped to the city water mains.198 Environmental Chemistry
8.3 TREATMENT OF WATER FOR INDUSTRIAL USE
Water is widely used in various process applications in industry. Other major industrial uses are 
boiler feedwater and cooling water. The kind and degree of treatment of water in these applications 
depends upon the end use. As examples, cooling water may require only minimal treatment, removal 
of corrosive substances and scale-forming solutes is essential for boiler feedwater, and water used 
in food processing must be free of pathogens and toxic substances. Improper treatment of water for 
industrial use can cause problems such as corrosion, scale formation, reduced heat transfer in heat 
exchangers, reduced water fl  ow, and product contamination. These effects may cause reduced equip-
ment performance or equipment failure, increased energy costs due to ineffi  cient heat utilization or 
cooling, increased costs for pumping water, and product deterioration. Obviously, the effective 
treatment of water at minimum cost for industrial use is a very important area of water treatment.
Numerous factors must be taken into consideration in designing and operating an industrial 
water treatment facility. These include the following:
Water requirement• 
Quantity and quality of available water sources• 
Sequential use of water (successive uses for applications requiring progressively lower • 
water quality)
Water recycle• 
Discharge standards• 
The various specifi  c processes employed to treat water for industrial use are discussed in later 
sections of this chapter. External treatment , usually applied to the plant’s entire water supply, uses 
processes such as aeration, fi  ltration, and clarifi  cation to remove material that may cause problems 
from water. Such substances include suspended or dissolved solids, hardness, and dissolved gases. 
Following this basic treatment, the water may be divided into different streams, some to be used 
without further treatment, and the rest to be treated for specifi  c applications.

Addition of inhibitors to prevent corrosion• 
Adjustment of pH• 
Disinfection for food processing uses or to prevent bacterial growth in cooling water• 
An important aspect of industrial process water treatment is the use of antiscalants and disper-
sants. The former prevent scale from materials such as CaCO3 from building up and dispersants 
keep scale particles from adhering to surfaces by keeping them dispersed in water. One of the 
most effective agents for this purpose is polyacrylate polymer formed by the polymerization of 
acrylic acid and treatment with base. This polymer binds with scale-forming substances and 
keeps them dispersed in water by virtue of the negative charge of the polyacrylate. This same 
dispersant quality is useful in detergent formulations, some of which are about 5% polyacrylate. 
Polyacrylate is not biodegradable and accumulates with sludge residues from water treatment 
processes.

8.4 SEWAGE TREATMENT
Typical municipal sewage contains oxygen-demanding materials, sediments, grease, oil, scum, 
pathogenic bacteria, viruses, salts, algal nutrients, pesticides, refractory organic compounds, heavy 
metals, and an astonishing variety of fl  otsam ranging from children’s socks to sponges. It is the job 
of the waste treatment plant to remove as much of this material as possible.
Several characteristics are used to describe sewage. These include turbidity (international tur-
bidity units), suspended solids (ppm), total dissolved solids (ppm), acidity (H+ ion concentration or 
pH), and DO (in ppm O2). BOD is used as a measure of oxygen-demanding substances.
Current processes for the treatment of wastewater may be divided into three main categories 
of  primary treatment, secondary treatment, and tertiary treatment, each of which is discussed sepa-
rately. Also discussed are total wastewater treatment systems, based largely upon physical and 
chemical processes.
Waste from a municipal water system is normally treated in a publicly owned treatment works, 
POTW . In the United States, these systems are allowed to discharge only effl  uents that have attained 
a certain level of treatment, as mandated by Federal law.
8.4.1 P RIMARY  WASTE TREATMENT
Primary treatment of wastewater consists of the removal of insoluble matter such as grit, grease, 
and scum from water. The fi  rst step in primary treatment normally is screening. Screening removes 
or reduces the size of trash and large solids that get into the sewage system. These solids are col-
lected on screens and scraped off for subsequent disposal. Most screens are cleaned with power 
rakes. Comminuting devices shred and grind solids in the sewage. Particle size may be reduced to 
the extent that the particles can be returned to the sewage fl  ow.

degrade well and generally have a high settling velocity. Grit removal is practiced to prevent its 
accumulation in other parts of the treatment system, to reduce clogging of pipes and other parts, and 
to protect moving parts from abrasion and wear. Grit is normally allowed to settle in a tank under 
conditions of low fl  ow velocity, and it is then scraped mechanically from the bottom of the tank.200 Environmental Chemistry
Primary sedimentation removes both settleable and fl  oatable solids. During primary sedimenta-
tion there is a tendency for fl  occulant particles to aggregate for better settling, a process that may be 
aided by the addition of chemicals. The material that fl  oats in the primary settling basin is known 
collectively as grease. In addition to fatty substances, the grease consists of oils, waxes, free fatty 
acids, and insoluble soaps containing calcium and magnesium. Normally, some of the grease settles 
with the sludge and some fl  oats to the surface, where it may be removed by a skimming device.
8.4.2 S ECONDARY  WASTE TREATMENT  BY BIOLOGICAL  PROCESSES
The most obvious harmful effect of biodegradable organic matter in wastewater is BOD, consisting 
of a biochemical oxygen demand for dissolved oxygen by microorganism-mediated degradation of 
the organic matter. Secondary wastewater treatment is designed to remove BOD, usually by taking 
advantage of the same kind of biological processes that would otherwise consume oxygen in water 
receiving the wastewater. Secondary treatment by biological processes takes many forms but con-
sists basically of the action of micro organisms provided with added oxygen degrading organic 
material in solution or in suspension until the BOD of the waste has been reduced to acceptable 
levels.1 The waste is oxidized biologically under conditions controlled for optimum bacterial growth, 
and at a site where this growth does not infl  uence the environment.
One of the simplest biological waste treatment processes is the trickling fi  lter (Figure 8.2) in 
which wastewater is sprayed over rocks or other solid support material covered with microorgan-
isms. The structure of the trickling fi  lter is such that contact of the wastewater with air is allowed 
and degradation of organic matter occurs by the action of the microorganisms.
Rotating biological reactors  (contactors ), another type of treatment system, consist of groups of 
large plastic discs mounted close together on a rotating shaft. The device is positioned such that at 
any particular instant half of each disc is immersed in wastewater and half exposed to air. The shaft 
rotates constantly, so that the submerged portion of the discs is always changing. The discs, usually 
m a d e  o f  h i g h - d e n s i t y  p o l y e t h y l e n e  o r  p o l y s t y r e n e ,  a c c u m u l a t e  t h i n  l a y e r s  o f  a t t a c h e d  b i o m a s s ,  
which degrades organic matter in the sewage. Oxygen is absorbed by the biomass and by the layer 
of wastewater adhering to it during the time that the biomass is exposed to air.
Both trickling fi  lters and rotating biological reactors are examples of fi  xed-fi  lm biological (FFB) 
or attached growth processes. The greatest advantage of these processes is their low energy con-
sumption. The energy consumption is minimal because it is not necessary to pump air or oxygen 
into the water, as is the case with the popular activated sludge process described below. The trick-
ling fi  lter has long been a standard means of wastewater treatment, and a number of wastewater 
treatment plants use trickling fi  lters at present.
The activated sludge process , Figure 8.3, is probably the most versatile and effective of all waste-
water treatment processes. Microorganisms in the aeration tank convert organic material in wastewater 
FIGURE 8.2 Trickling fi  lter for secondary waste treatment.Water Treatment 201
to microbial biomass and CO2. Organic nitrogen is converted to ammonium ion or nitrate. Organic 
phosphorus is converted to orthophosphate. The microbial cell matter formed as part of the waste 
degradation processes is normally kept in the aeration tank until the micro organisms are past the log 
phase of growth (Section 6.7), at which point the cells fl  occulate relatively well to form settleable solids. 
These solids settle out in a settler and a fraction of them is discarded. Part of the solids, the return 
sludge, is recycled to the head of the aeration tank and comes into contact with fresh sewage. The com-
bination of a high concentration of “hungry” cells in the return sludge and a rich food source in the 
infl uent sewage provides optimum conditions for the rapid degradation of organic matter. The degrada-
ti o n  o f  o r g ani c  m a tt e r  th a t  o c c ur s  in  an  a c ti v a t ed  s l u d g e  f a c ili ty  al s o  o c c ur s  in  s tr e am s  an d  o th e r 
aquatic environments. However, in general, when a degradable waste is put into a stream, it encounters 
only a relatively small population of microorganisms capable of carrying out the degradation process. 
Thus, several days may be required for the buildup of a suffi  cient population of organisms to degrade 
the waste. In the activated sludge process, continual recycling of active organisms provides the opti-
mum conditions for waste degradation, and a waste may be degraded within the very few hours that it 
is present in the aeration tank.
The activated sludge process provides two pathways for the removal of BOD, as illustrated sche-
matically in Figure 8.4. BOD may be removed by (1) oxidation of organic matter to provide energy 
for the metabolic processes of the microorganisms and (2) synthesis, incorporation of the organic 
matter into cell mass. In the fi  rst pathway, carbon is removed in the gaseous form as CO2. The  second 
pathway provides for removal of carbon as a solid in biomass. That portion of the carbon converted 
to CO2 is vented to the atmosphere and does not present a disposal problem. The disposal of waste 
sludge, however, is a problem, primarily because it is only about 1% solids and contains many 
un desirable components. Normally, partial water removal is accomplished by drying on sand fi  lters, 
vacuum fi  ltration, or centrifugation. The dewatered sludge may be incinerated or used as landfi  ll. Wastewater containing

To a certain extent, sewage sludge may be digested in the absence of oxygen by methane-producing 
anaerobic bacteria to produce methane and carbon dioxide, a process that reduces both the volatile-
matter content and the volume of the sludge by about 60%. A carefully designed plant may produce 
enough methane to provide for all of its power needs:
 2{CH2O} Æ CH4 + CO2 (8.1)
One of the most desirable means of sludge disposal is to use it to fertilize and condition soil. 
However, care has to be taken that excessive levels of heavy metals are not applied to the soil as 
sludge contaminants. Problems with various kinds of sludges resulting from water treatment are 
discussed further in Section 8.10.
Activated sludge wastewater treatment is the most common example of an aerobic suspended 
culture process. Many factors must be considered in the design and operation of an activated sludge 
wastewater treatment system. These include parameters involved with the process modeling and 
kinetics. The microbiology of the system must be considered. In addition to BOD removal, phospho-
rus and nitrogen removal must also be taken into account. Oxygen transfer and solids separation are 
important. Industrial wastes and the fates and effects of industrial chemicals (xenobiotics) must also 
be considered.
Nitrifi  cation (the microbially mediated conversion of ammonium nitrogen to nitrate; see Section 
6.11) is a signifi  cant process that occurs during biological waste treat ment. Ammonium ion is nor-
mally the fi  rst inorganic nitrogen species produced in the biodegradation of nitrogenous organic 
compounds. It is oxidized, under the appropriate conditions, fi  rst to nitrite by Nitrosomonas  bacte-
ria, then to nitrate by Nitrobacter :
 2NH4+ + 3O2 Æ 4H+ + 2NO2- + 2H2O (8.2)
 2NO2- + O2 Æ 2NO3- (8.3)
These reactions occur in the aeration tank of the activated sludge plant and are favored in gen-
eral by long retention times, low organic loadings, large amounts of suspended solids, and high 
temperatures. Nitrifi  cation can reduce sludge settling effi  ciency because the denitrifi  cation 
reaction
 4NO3- + 5{CH2O} + 4H+ Æ 2N2(g) + 5CO2(g) + 7H2O (8.4)
occurring in the oxygen-defi  cient settler causes bubbles of N2 to form on the sludge fl  oc (aggre-
gated sludge particles), making it so buoyant that it fl  oats to the top. This prevents settling of the 
sludge and increases the organic load in the receiving waters. Under the appropriate conditions, 
however, advantage can be taken of this phenomenon to remove nutrient nitrogen from water (see 
Section 8.9).Organic

8.4.3 M EMBRANE  BIOREACTOR
A problem with the activated sludge process is the diffi  culty encountered in settling the suspended 
biomass. Incomplete separation of the suspended solids in the sludge settling unit can result in solids 
contamination of the effl  uent and a dilute sludge that lacks suffi  cient biomass of active organisms 
required for effective waste biodegradation. These problems can be overcome with a membrane bio-
reactor in which a suspension of active biomass is maintained in an aeration tank and treated water is 
withdrawn through a membrane fi  lter (see Section 8.6). In some confi  gurations the membrane is 
immersed in the aeration chamber and the treated effl  uent drawn through the membrane fi  lter under 
vacuum whereas in others the treated effl  uent is pumped through the fi  lter under pressure.
8.4.4 T ERTIARY  WASTE TREATMENT
Unpleasant as the thought may be, many people drink used water—water that has been discharged 
from a municipal sewage treatment plant or from some industrial process. This raises serious 
 questions about the presence of pathogenic organisms or toxic substances in such water. Because of 
high population density and heavy industrial development, the problem is especially acute in Europe 
where some municipalities process 50% or more of their water from “used” sources. Obviously, 
there is a great need to treat wastewater in a manner that makes it amenable to reuse. This requires 
treatment beyond the secondary processes.
Tertiary waste treatment  (sometimes called advanced waste treatment ) is a term used to describe 
a variety of processes performed on the effl  uent from secondary waste treatment.1 The contami-
nants removed by tertiary waste treatment fall into the general categories of (1) suspended solids, 
(2) dissolved inorganic materials, and (3) dissolved organic compounds, including the important 
class of algal nutrients. Low levels of substances and their metabolites, such as pharmaceuticals, 
synthetic and natural hormones, and personal care products that are discharged in sewage, pose 
challenges in advanced wastewater treatment. Suspended solids are primarily responsible for resid-
ual biological oxygen demand in secondary sewage effl  uent waters. The dissolved organics are the 
most hazardous from the standpoint of potential toxicity. The major problem with dissolved inor-
ganic materials is that presented by algal nutrients, primarily nitrates, and phosphates. In addition, 
potentially hazardous toxic metals may be found among the dissolved inorganics.
In addition to these chemical contaminants, secondary sewage effl  uent often contains a number of 
disease-causing microorganisms, requiring disinfection in cases where humans may later come into 
contact with the water. Among the bacteria that may be found in secondary sewage effl  uent are 
organisms causing tuberculosis, dysenteric bacteria ( Bacillus dysenteriae , Shigella dysenteriae , 
Shigella paradysenteriae , Proteus vulgaris ), cholera bacteria ( Vibriocholerae ), bacteria causing 
mud fever ( Leptospiraicterohemorrhagiae ), and bacteria causing typhoid fever ( Salmonella typhosa , 
Salmonella paratyphi ). In addition, viruses causing diarrhea, eye infections, infectious hepatitis, and 
polio may be encountered. Ingestion of sewage still causes disease, even in more developed nations.
8.4.5 P HYSICAL −CHEMICAL  TREATMENT  OF MUNICIPAL  WASTEWATER
Complete physical−chemical wastewater treatment systems offer both advantages and disadvan-
tages relative to biological treatment systems. The capital costs of physical−chemical facilities can 
be less than those of biological treatment facilities, and they usually require less land. They are 
 better able to cope with toxic materials and overloads. However, they require careful operator  control 
and consume relatively large amounts of energy. 
Basically, a physical−chemical treatment process involves:
Removal of scum and solid objects• 
Clarifi  cation, generally with addition of a coagulant, and frequently with the addition of • 
other chemicals (such as lime for phosphorus removal)204 Environmental Chemistry
Filtration to remove fi  lterable solids • 
Activated carbon adsorption• 
Disinfection• 
The basic steps of a complete physical−chemical wastewater treatment facility are shown in 
Figure 8.5.
During the early 1970s, it appeared likely that physical−chemical treatment would largely replace 
biological treatment. However, higher chemical and energy costs since then have slowed the devel-
opment of physical−chemical facilities.
8.5 INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER TREATMENT
Before treatment, industrial wastewater should be characterized fully and the biodegradability of 
wastewater constituents determined. The options available for the treatment of wastewater are 
 summarized briefl  y in this section and discussed in greater detail in later sections.
One of two major ways of removing organic wastes is biological treatment by an activated sludge 
or related process (see Section 8.4 and Figure 8.3). It may be necessary to acclimate microorganisms 
to the degradation of constituents that are not normally biodegradable. Consideration needs to be 
given to possible hazards of biotreatment sludges, such as those containing excessive levels of heavy GritLimeAlum

metal ions. The other major process for the removal of organics from wastewater is sorption by 
activated carbon (see Section 8.8), usually in columns of granular activated carbon. Activated 
 carbon and biological treatment can be combined with the use of powdered activated carbon in the 
activated sludge process. The powdered activated carbon sorbs some constituents that may be toxic 
to microorganisms and is collected with the sludge. A major consideration with the use of activated 
carbon to treat wastewater is the hazard that spent activated carbon may present from the wastes it 
retains. These hazards may include those of toxicity or reactivity, such as those hazards posed by 
wastes from the manufacture of explosives sorbed to activated carbon. Regeneration of the carbon 
is expensive and can be hazardous in some cases.
Wastewater can be treated by a variety of chemical processes, including acid/base neutralization, 
precipitation, and oxidation/reduction. Sometimes these steps must precede biological treatment; 
for example, acidic or alkaline wastewater must be neutralized in order for microorganisms to thrive 
in it. Cyanide in the wastewater may be oxidized with chlorine and organics with ozone, hydrogen 
pe ro xi de  pro m o ted  wi th  ul tra vi o l e t  radi a ti o n,  o r  DO  a t  hi gh  te m pe ra ture s  an d  pre s s ure s .  H ea vy  
 metals may be precipitated with base, carbonate, or sulfi  de.
Wastewater can be treated by several physical processes. In some cases, simple density separa-
tion and sedimentation can be used to remove water-immiscible liquids and solids. Filtration is 
frequently required, and fl  otation by gas bubbles generated on particle surfaces may be useful. 
Wastewater solutes can be concentrated by evaporation, distillation, and membrane processes, 
including reverse osmosis, hyperfi  ltration, and ultrafi  ltration. Organic constituents can be removed 
by solvent extraction, air stripping, or steam stripping.
Synthetic resins are useful for removing some pollutant solutes from wastewater. Organophilic 
resins have proven useful for the removal of alcohols; aldehydes; ketones; hydrocarbons; chlorinated 
alkanes, alkenes, and aryl compounds; esters, including phthalate esters; and pesticides. Cation 
exchange resins are effective for the removal of heavy metals.
8.6 REMOVAL OF SOLIDS
Relatively large solid particles are removed from water by simple settling and fi l t r a t i o n . The 
removal of colloidal solids from water usually requires coagulation .2 Salts of aluminum and iron 
are the coagulants most often used in water treatment. Of these, alum or fi  lter alum is the most 
commonly used. This substance is a hydrated aluminum sulfate, Al2(SO4)3 ◊ 18H2O. When this salt 
is added to water, the aluminum ion hydrolyzes by reactions that consume alkalinity in the water, 
such as
 Al(H2O)63+ + 3HCO3- Æ Al(OH)3 (s)  + 3CO2 + 6H2O (8.5)
The gelatinous hydroxide thus formed carries suspended material with it as it settles. Furthermore, 
it is likely that positively charged hydroxyl-bridged dimers such as
 H
HO
OAl(H2O)44+(H2O)4 Al
and higher polymers are formed which interact specifi  cally with colloidal particles, bringing 
about coagulation. Sodium silicate partially neutralized by acid aids coagulation, particularly 
when used with alum. Metal ions in coagulants also react with virus proteins and destroy viruses 
in water.
Anhydrous iron(III) sulfate added to water forms iron(III) hydroxide in a reaction analogous to 
Reaction 8.5. An advantage of iron(III) sulfate is that it works over a wide pH range of approximately 206 Environmental Chemistry
4–11. Hydrated iron(II) sulfate, or copperas, FeSO4 ◊ 7H2O, is also commonly used as a coagulant. It 
forms a gelatinous precipitate of hydrated iron(III) oxide; in order to function, it must be oxidized to 
iron(III) by DO in the water at a pH higher than 8.5, or by chlorine, which can oxidize iron(II) at 
lower pH values.
Natural and synthetic polyelectrolytes are used in fl  occulating particles. Among the natural 
compounds so used are starch and cellulose derivatives, proteinaceous materials, and gums 
 composed of polysaccharides. More recently, selected synthetic polymers, including neutral poly-
mers and both anionic and cationic polyelectrolytes, that are effective fl  occulants have come 
into use.
Coagulation−fi  ltration is a much more effective procedure than fi  ltration alone for the removal 
of suspended material from water. As the term implies, the process consists of the addition of 
coagulants that aggregate the particles into larger size particles, followed by fi  ltration. Either alum 
or lime, often with added polyelectrolytes, is most commonly employed for coagulation.
The fi  ltration step of coagulation−fi  l tra ti o n  i s  u s uall y  pe rf o rm ed  o n  a  m edi um  s u c h  as  s an d  o r 
anthracite coal. Often, to reduce clogging, several media with progressively smaller interstitial spaces 
are used. One example is the rapid sand fi  lter , which consists of a layer of sand supported by layers of 
gravel particles, the particles becoming progressively larger with increasing depth. The substance that 
actually fi  lters the water is coagulated material that collects in the sand. As more material is removed, 
the buildup of coagulated material eventually clogs the fi  lter and must be removed by back-fl  ushing.
An important class of solids that must be removed from wastewater consists of suspended solids 
in secondary sewage effl  uent that arise primarily from sludge that was not removed in the settling 
process. These solids account for a large part of the BOD in the effl  uent and may interfere with other 
aspects of tertiary waste treatment, such as by clogging membranes in reverse osmosis water treat-
ment processes. The quantity of material involved may be rather high. Processes designed to remove 
suspended solids often will remove 10–20 mg/L of organic material from secondary sewage effl  u-
ent. In addition, a small amount of the inorganic material is removed.

8.6.1 D ISSOLVED  AIR FLOTATION
Many of the particles found in water have low densities close to or even less than that of water. 
Particles less dense than water have a tendency to rise to the surface from which they can be 
skimmed off, but this is often a slow and incomplete process. The removal of such particles can be 
aided by dissolved air fl  otation in which small air bubbles are formed that attach to particles caus-
ing them to fl  oat. As shown in Figure 8.6, fl  otation of particles with air can be accompanied by 
coagulation of the particles as aided by a coagulant. Water supersaturated with air under pressure is 
released to the bottom of a tank where bubbles are formed in a layer of milky (white) water. Bubble 
formation accompanied by fl  occulation of the particles entrains bubbles in the fl  oc, which fl  oats to 
the surface where it is skimmed off.
8.6.2 M EMBRANE  FILTRATION  PROCESSES
Filtration through membranes under pressure is an especially effective means of removing solids 
and impurities from water.3 The purifi  ed water that goes through a membrane is the permeate and 
the smaller amount of material that does not go through the membrane is a retentate . Membranes Water Treatment 207
normally operate by size exclusion. As membranes with smaller openings are used, smaller particles 
and even molecules and ions are excluded, but higher pressures are required and more energy is 
consumed. In order of decreasing pore size, the common membrane processes are microfi  ltra-
tion > ultrafi  ltration > nanofi  ltration > and hyperfi  ltration . Microfi  ltration membranes have pores of 
0.1–2 μm in size, and the other processes use membranes with progressively smaller pores. The 
main types of membrane processes and their uses are summarized in Table 8.1 and reverse osmosis 
is discussed in Section 8.9.
A problem common to all membrane processes is that posed by the retentate, which is concen-
trated in the substances that are removed from water. In some cases, this material may be discharged 
with wastewater, and retentate from the reverse osmosis desalination of seawater may be returned 
to the sea. Other options, depending upon the source of water treated, include evaporation of water 
and incineration of the residue, reclamation of materials from some industrial wastewaters, and 
disposal in deep saline water aquifers.
8.7 REMOVAL OF CALCIUM AND OTHER METALS
Calcium and magnesium salts, which generally are present in water as bicarbonates or sulfates, 
cause water hardness. One of the most common manifestations of water hardness is the insoluble 
“curd” formed by the reaction of soap with calcium or magnesium ions. The formation of these 
insoluble soap salts is discussed in Section 7.10. Although ions that cause water hardness do not Coagulant added

form insoluble products with detergents, they do adversely affect detergent performance. Therefore, 
calcium and magnesium must be complexed or removed from water in order for detergents to func-
tion properly.
Another problem caused by hard water is the formation of mineral deposits. For example, when 
water containing calcium and bicarbonate ions is heated, insoluble calcium carbonate is formed:
 Ca2+ + 2HCO3- Æ CaCO3 (s) + CO2 (g) + H2O (8.6)
This product coats the surfaces of hot water systems, clogging pipes, and reducing heating effi  -
ciency. Dissolved salts such as calcium and magnesium bicarbonates and sulfates can be especially 
damaging in boiler feedwater. Clearly, the removal of water hardness is essential for many uses of 
water.
Several processes are used for softening water. On a large scale, such as in community water-
softening operations, the lime-soda process is used. This process involves the treatment of water 
with lime, Ca(OH)2, and soda ash, Na2CO3. Calcium is precipitated as CaCO3 and magnesium as 
Mg(OH)2. When the calcium is present primarily as “bicarbonate hardness,” it can be removed by 
the addition of Ca(OH)2 alone:
 Ca2+ + 2HCO3- + Ca(OH)2 Æ 2CaCO3 (s)  +  2H2O (8.7)
When bicarbonate ion is not present at substantial levels, a source of CO32- must be provided at a 
high enough pH to prevent conversion of most of the CO32- to HCO3-. These conditions are obtained 
by the addition of Na2CO3. For example, calcium present as the chloride can be removed from water 
by the addition of soda ash:
 Ca2+ + 2Cl- + 2Na+ + CO32- Æ CaCO3 (s) + 2Cl- + 2Na+ (8.8)
Note that the removal of bicarbonate hardness results in a net removal of soluble salts from solution, 
whereas removal of nonbicarbonate hardness involves the addition of at least as many equivalents 
of ionic material as are removed.
The precipitation of magnesium as the hydroxide requires a higher pH than the precipitation of 
calcium as the carbonate:
 Mg2+ + 2OH- Æ Mg(OH)2 (s) (8.9)
The high pH required may be provided by the basic carbonate ion from soda ash:
 CO32- + H2O Æ HCO3- + OH- (8.10)
Some large-scale lime-soda softening plants make use of the precipitated calcium carbonate prod-
uct as a source of additional lime. The calcium carbonate is fi  rst heated to at least 825°C to produce 
quicklime, CaO:
 CaCO3 + heat Æ CaO + CO2 (g) (8.11)
The quicklime is then slaked with water to produce calcium hydroxide:
 CaO + H2O Æ Ca(OH)2 (8.12)
The water softened by lime-soda softening plants usually suffers from two defects. First, because 
of supersaturation effects, some CaCO3 and Mg(OH)2 usually remain in solution. If not removed, 
these compounds will precipitate at a later time and cause harmful deposits or undesirable cloudi-
ness in water. The second problem results from the use of highly basic sodium carbonate, which 
gives the product water an excessively high pH, up to pH 11. To overcome these problems, the Water Treatment 209
water is recarbonated by bubbling CO2 into it. The carbon dioxide converts the slightly soluble 
calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide to their soluble bicarbonate forms:
 CaCO3(s)  + CO2 + H2O Æ Ca2+ + 2HCO3- (8.13)
 Mg(OH)2 (s)  + 2CO2 Æ Mg2+ + 2HCO3- (8.14)
The CO2 also neutralizes excess hydroxide ion:
 OH- + CO2 Æ HCO3- (8.15)
The pH generally is brought within the range 7.5–8.5 by recarbonation. The source of CO2 used 
in the recarbonation process may be from the combustion of carbonaceous fuel. Scrubbed stack 
gas from a power plant frequently is utilized. Water adjusted to a pH, alkalinity, and Ca2+ concen-
tration very close to CaCO3 saturation is labeled chemically stabilized . It neither precipitates 
CaCO3 in water mains, which can clog the pipes, nor dissolves protective CaCO3 coatings from 
the pipe surfaces. Water with Ca2+ concentration much below CaCO3 saturation is called aggres-
sive water.
Calcium may be removed from water very effi  ciently by the addition of orthophosphate:
 5Ca2+ + 3PO43- + OH- Æ Ca5OH(PO4)3 (s) (8.16)
It should be pointed out that the chemical formation of a slightly soluble product for the removal of 
undesired solutes such as hardness ions, phosphate, iron, and manganese must be followed by sedi-
mentation in a suitable apparatus. Frequently, coagulants must be added, and fi  ltration employed for 
complete removal of these sediments.
Water may be purifi  ed by ion exchange, the reversible transfer of ions between aquatic solution 
and a solid material capable of bonding ions. The removal of NaCl from solution by two ion exchange 
reactions is a good illustration of this process. First the water is passed over a solid cation exchanger 
in the hydrogen form, represented by H+-{Cat ( s)}:
 H+ -{Cat ( s)} + Na+ + Cl- Æ Na+ -{Cat ( s)} + H+ + Cl- (8.17)
Next, the water is passed over an anion exchanger in the hydroxide ion form, represented by 
OH-+{An ( s)}:
 OH- +{An ( s)} + H+ + Cl- Æ Cl- +{An ( s)} + H2O (8.18)
Thus, the cations in solution are replaced by hydrogen ion and the anions by hydroxide ion, yielding 
water as the product.
The softening of water by ion exchange does not require the removal of all ionic solutes, just 
those cations responsible for water hardness. Generally, therefore, only a cation exchanger is neces-
sary. Furthermore, the sodium rather than the hydrogen form of the cation exchanger is used, and 
the divalent cations are replaced by sodium ion. Sodium ion at low concentrations is harmless in 
water to be used for most purposes, and sodium chloride is a cheap and convenient substance with 
which to recharge the cation exchangers.
A number of materials have ion-exchanging properties. Among the minerals especially noted for 
their ion exchange properties are the aluminum silicate minerals, or zeolites . An example of a zeo-
lite which has been used commercially in water softening is glauconite, K2(MgFe)2Al6(Si4O10)3(OH)12. 
Synthetic zeolites have been prepared by drying and crushing the white gel produced by mixing 
solutions of sodium silicate and sodium aluminate.210 Environmental Chemistry
The discovery in the mid-1930s of synthetic ion exchange resins composed of organic polymers 
with attached functional groups marked the beginning of modern ion exchange technology. 
Structural formulas of typical synthetic ion exchangers are shown in Figures 8.7 and 8.8. The cation 
exchanger shown in Figure 8.7 is called a s t r o n g l y  a c i d i c  c a t i o n  e x c han g e r  because the parent 
 –SO3-H+ group is a strong acid. When the functional group binding the cation is the –CO2- group, the 
exchange resin is called a weakly acidic cation exchanger , because the –CO2H group is a weak acid. 
Figure 8.8 shows a strongly basic anion exchanger in which the functional group is a quaternary 
ammonium group, –N+(CH3)3. In the hydroxide form, –N+(CH3)3OH-, the hydroxide ion is readily 
released, so the exchanger is classifi  ed as strongly basic .
The water-softening capability of a cation exchanger is shown in Figure 8.7, where sodium ion on 
the exchanger is exchanged for calcium ion in solution. The same reaction occurs with magnesium 
ion. Water softening by cation exchange is a widely used, effective, and economical process. In 
many areas having a low water fl  ow, however, widespread home water softening by ion exchange 
causes deterioration of water quality arising from the contamination of wastewater by sodium chlo-
ride. Such contamination results from the periodic need to regenerate a water softener with sodium 
chloride in order to displace calcium and magnesium ions from the resin and replace these hardness 
ions with sodium ions:
 Ca2+ -{Cat ( s)}2 + 2Na+ + 2Cl- Æ 2Na+ -{Cat ( s)} + Ca2+ + 2Cl- (8.19)
During the regeneration process, a large excess of sodium chloride must be used—several pounds 
for a home water softener. Appreciable amounts of dissolved sodium chloride can be introduced into 
sewage by this route.
Strongly acidic cation exchangers are used for the removal of water hardness. Weakly acidic 
cation exchangers having the –CO2H group as a functional group are useful for removing alkalinity. 
Alkalinity generally is manifested by bicarbonate ion, a species that is a suffi  ciently strong base to 
neutralize the acid of a weak acid cation exchanger:
 2R-CO2H + Ca2+ + 2HCO3- Æ [R-CO2-]2Ca2+ + 2H2O + 2CO2. (8.20)

However, weak bases such as sulfate ion or chloride ion are not strong enough to remove hydrogen 
ion from the carboxylic acid exchanger. An additional advantage of these exchangers is that they 
may be regenerated almost stoichiometrically with dilute strong acids, thus avoiding the potential 
pollution problem caused by the use of excess sodium chloride to regenerate strongly acidic cation 
changers.
Chelation  or, as it is sometimes known, sequestration , is an effective method of softening water 
without actually having to remove calcium and magnesium from solution. A complexing agent is 
added which greatly reduces the concentrations of free hydrated cations, as shown by some of 
the example calculations in Chapter 3. For example, chelating calcium ion with excess EDTA 
anion (Y4-),
 Ca2+ + Y4- Æ CaY2- (8.21)
reduces the concentration of hydrated calcium ion, preventing the precipitation of calcium 
carbonate:
 Ca2+ + CO32- Æ CaCO3 (s) (8.22)
Polyphosphate salts, EDTA, and NTA (see Chapter 3) are chelating agents commonly used for water 
softening. Polysilicates are used to complex iron.
8.7.1 R EMOVAL  OF IRON AND MANGANESE
Soluble iron and manganese are found in many groundwaters because of reducing conditions which 
favor the soluble +2 oxidation state of these metals (see Chapter 4). Iron is the more commonly 
encountered of the two metals. In groundwater, the level of iron seldom exceeds 10 mg/L, and that 
of manganese is rarely higher than 2 mg/L. The basic method for removing both of these metals 
depends upon oxidation to higher insoluble oxidation states. The oxidation is generally accom-
plished by aeration. The rate of oxidation is pH-dependent in both cases, with a high pH favoring 
more rapid oxidation. The oxidation of soluble Mn(II) to insoluble MnO2 is a complicated process. 
It appears to be catalyzed by solid MnO2, which is known to adsorb Mn(II). This adsorbed Mn(II) 
is slowly oxidized on the MnO2 surface.
Chlorine and potassium permanganate are sometimes employed as oxidizing agents for iron and 
man g anese . There is some e vi dence that org ani c c he latin g ag en ts wi th reducin g properti es ho l d 
iron(II) in a soluble form in water. In such cases, chlorine is effective because it destroys the organic 
compounds and enables the oxidation of iron(II).
In water with a high level of carbonate, FeCO3 and MnCO3 may be precipitated directly by rais-
ing the pH above 8.5 by the addition of sodium carbonate or lime. This approach is less popular than 
oxidation, however.
Relatively high levels of insoluble iron(III) and manganese(IV) frequently are found in water as 
colloidal material which is diffi  cult to remove. These metals may be associated with humic colloids 
or “peptizing” organic material that binds to colloidal metal oxides, stabilizing the colloid.
Heavy metals such as copper, cadmium, mercury, and lead are found in wastewaters from a 
number of industrial processes. Because of the toxicity of many heavy metals, their concentrations 
must be reduced to very low levels prior to release of the wastewater. A number of approaches are 
used in heavy metals removal.
Lime treatment, discussed earlier in this section for calcium removal, precipitates heavy metals 
as insoluble hydroxides, basic salts, or coprecipitated with calcium carbonate or iron(III) hydroxide. 
This process does not completely remove mercury, cadmium, or lead, so their removal is aided by 
addition of sulfi  de (most heavy metals are sulfi  de-seekers):
 Cd2+ + S2- Æ CdS ( s) (8.23)212 Environmental Chemistry
Heavy chlorination is frequently necessary to break down metal-solubilizing ligands (see Chapter 3). 
Lime precipitation does not normally permit recovery of metals and is sometimes undesirable from 
the economic viewpoint.
Electrodeposition (reduction of metal ions to metal by electrons at an electrode), reverse osmosis  
(see Section 8.9), and ion exchange  are frequently employed for metal removal. Solvent extraction using 
organic-soluble chelating substances is also effective in removing many metals. Cementation , a process 
by which a metal deposits by reaction of its ion with a more readily oxidized metal, may be employed:
 Cu2+ + Fe (iron scrap) Æ Fe2+ + Cu (8.24)
Activated carbon adsorption effectively removes some metals from water at the part per million 
level. Sometimes a chelating agent is sorbed to the charcoal to increase metal removal.
Even when not specifi  cally designed for the removal of heavy metals, most waste treatment pro-
cesses remove appreciable quantities of the more troublesome heavy metals encountered in waste-
water. Biological waste treatment effectively removes metals from water. These metals accumulate 
in the sludge from biological treatment, so sludge disposal must be given careful consideration.
Various physical−chemical treatment processes effectively remove heavy metals from waste-
waters. One such treatment is lime precipitation followed by activated-carbon fi  ltration. Activated-
carbon fi  l trati on ma y also be preceded b y treatmen t wi th iron(III) c hl ori de to f orm an iron(III) 
hydroxide fl  oc, which is an effective heavy metals scavenger. Similarly, alum, which forms alumi-
num hydroxide, may be added prior to activated-carbon fi  ltration.
The form of the heavy metal has a strong effect upon the effi  ciency of metal removal. For instance, 
chromi um(VI) is normall y more diffi  cult to remove than chromium(III). Chelation may prevent 
metal removal by solubilizing metals (see Chapter 3).
In the past, removal of heavy metals has been largely a fringe benefi  t of wastewater treatment 
processes. Currently, however, more consideration is being given to design and operating para-
meters that specifi  cally enhance heavy-metals removal as part of wastewater treatment.
8.8 REMOVAL OF DISSOLVED ORGANICS
Very low levels of exotic organic compounds in drinking water are suspected of contributing to 
cancer and other maladies. Water disinfection processes, which by their nature involve chemi-
cally rather severe conditions, particularly of oxidation, have a tendency to produce disinfection 
by-products . Some of these are chlorinated organic compounds produced by chlorination of 
organics in water, especially humic substances. Removal of organics to very low levels prior to 
chlorination has been found to be effective in preventing THM formation. Another major class of 
d i s i n f e c t i o n  b y - p r o d u c t s  c o n s i s t s  o f  o r g a n o o x y g e n  c o m p o u n d s  s u c h  a s  a l d e h y d e s ,  c a r b o x y l i c  
acids, and oxoacids.
A variety of organic compounds survive, or are produced by, secondary wastewater treatment 
and should be considered as factors in discharge or reuse of the treated water. Almost half of these 
are humic substances (see Section 3.17) with a molecular-mass range of 1000–5000. Among the 
remainder are found ether-extractable materials, carbohydrates, proteins, detergents, tannins, and 
lignins. Because of their high molecular mass and anionic character, the humic compounds infl  u-
ence some of the physical and chemical aspects of waste treatment. The ether extractables contain 
many of the compounds that are resistant to biodegradation and are of particular concern regarding 
potential toxicity, carcinogenicity, and mutagenicity. In the ether extract are found many fatty acids, 
hydrocarbons of the n-alkane class, naphthalene, diphenylmethane, diphenyl, methylnaphthalene, 
isopropylbenzene, dodecylbenzene, phenol, phthalates, and triethylphosphate.
The standard method for the removal of dissolved organic material is adsorption on activated 
carbon, a product that is produced from a variety of carbonaceous materials including wood, pulp-
mill char, peat, and lignite. The carbon is produced by charring the raw material anaerobically Water Treatment 213
below 600°C, followed by an activation step consisting of partial oxidation. Carbon dioxide may be 
employed as an oxidizing agent at 600–700°C.
 CO2 + C Æ 2CO (8.25)
or the carbon may be oxidized by steam at 800–900°C:
 H2O + C Æ H2 + CO (8.26)
These processes develop porosity, increase the surface area, and leave the C atoms in arrangements 
that have affi  nities for organic compounds.
Activated carbon comes in two general types: granulated activated carbon, consisting of particles 
0.1–1 mm in diameter, and powdered activated carbon, in which most of the particles are 50–100 μm 
in diameter.
The exact mechanism by which activated carbon holds organic materials is not known. However, 
one reason for the effectiveness of this material as an adsorbent is its tremendous surface area. A 
solid cubic foot of carbon particles may have a combined pore and surface area of approximately 
10 square miles!
Although interest is increasing in the use of powdered activated carbon for water treatment, cur-
rently granular carbon is more widely used. It may be employed in a fi  xed bed, through which water 
fl ows downward. Accumulation of particulate matter requires periodic backwashing. An expanded 
bed in which particles are kept slightly separated by water fl  owing upward may be used with less 
chance of clogging.
Economics require regeneration of the carbon, which is accomplished by heating it to 950°C in 
a steam−air atmosphere. This process oxidizes adsorbed organics and regenerates the carbon 
 surface, with an approximately 10% loss of carbon.
Removal of organics may also be accomplished by adsorbent synthetic polymers. Such polymers 
as Amberlite XAD-4 have hydrophobic surfaces and strongly attract relatively insoluble organic 
compounds, such as chlorinated pesticides. The porosity of these polymers is up to 50% by volume, 
and the surface area may be as high as 850 m2/g. They are readily regenerated by solvents such as 
isopropanol and acetone. Under appropriate operating conditions, these polymers remove virtually 
all nonionic organic solutes; for example, phenol at 250 mg/L is reduced to less than 0.1 mg/L by 
appropriate treatment with Amberlite XAD-4.
Oxidation of dissolved organics holds some promise for their removal. Ozone, hydrogen perox-
ide, molecular oxygen (with or without catalysts), chlorine and its derivatives, permanganate, or 
ferrate [iron(VI)] can be used. Electrochemical oxidation may be possible in some cases. High-
energy e lectron beams produced b y hi gh- v o l tage e lectron acce lerators also ha v e the potential to 
destroy organic compounds.
8.8.1 R EMOVAL  OF HERBICIDES
Because of their widespread application and persistence, herbicides have proven to be particularly 
troublesome in drinking water sources. Their levels vary with season related to times that they are 
applied to control weeds. The more soluble ones are most likely to enter drinking water sources. 
One of the most troublesome is atrazine, which is often manifested by its metabolite desethylatra-
zine. Activated carbon treatment is the best means of removing herbicides and their metabolites 
from drinking water sources. A problem with activated carbon is that of preloading , in which natu-
ral organic matter in the water loads up the carbon and hinders uptake of pollutant organics such as 
herbicides. Pretreatment to remove such organic matter, such as fl  occulation and precipitation of 
humic substances, can signifi  cantly increase the effi  cacy of activated carbon for the removal of 
herbicides and other organics.214 Environmental Chemistry
8.9 REMOVAL OF DISSOLVED INORGANICS
In order for complete water recycling to be feasible, inorganic-solute removal is essential. The effl  u-
ent from secondary waste treatment generally contains 300–400 mg/L more dissolved inorganic 
material than does the municipal water supply. It is obvious, therefore, that 100% water recycling 
without removal of inorganics would cause the accumulation of an intolerable level of dissolved 
material. Even when water is not destined for immediate reuse, the removal of the inorganic nutri-
ents phosphorus and nitrogen is highly desirable to reduce eutrophication downstream. In some 
cases the removal of toxic trace metals is needed.
One of the most obvious methods for removing inorganics from water is distillation. However, 
the energy required for distillation is generally quite high, so that distillation is not generally eco-
nomically feasible. Furthermore, volatile materials such as ammonia and odorous compounds are 
carried over to a large extent in the distillation process unless special preventative measures are 
tak e n .  F r ee zin g  p r od u c e s  a  v e ry  p ur e  w a te r ,  b u t  i s  c o n s i d e r ed  un ec o n o mi c al  w i th  p r e s e n t  tec h -
nology. Ion exchange and membrane processes are the most cost-effective means of removing 
 inorganic materials from water. These processes are discussed below.
8.9.1 I ON EXCHANGE
The ion exchange method for softening water is described in detail in Section 8.7. The ion exchange 
process used for removal of inorganics consists of passing the water successively over a solid cation 
exchanger and a solid anion exchanger, which replace cations and anions by hydrogen ion and 
hydroxide ion, respectively, so that each equivalent of salt is replaced by a mole of water. For the 
hypothetical ionic salt MX, the reactions are the following where -{Cat ( s)} represents the solid 
 cation exchanger and +{An ( s)} represents the solid anion exchanger:
 H+-{Cat ( s)} + M+ + X- Æ M+-{Cat ( s)} + H+ + X- (8.27)
 OH-+{An ( s)} + H+ + X- Æ X-+{An ( s)} + H2O (8.28)
The cation exchanger is regenerated with strong acid and the anion exchanger with strong base.
Demineralization by ion exchange generally produces water of a very high quality. Unfortunately, 
some organic compounds in wastewater foul ion exchangers, and microbial growth on the exchang-
ers can diminish their effi  ciency. In addition, regeneration of the resins is expensive, and the 
c o n c e n t r a t e d  w a s t e s  f r o m  r e g e n e r a t i o n  r e q u i r e  d i s p o s a l  i n  a  m a n n e r  t h a t  w i l l  n o t  d a m a g e  t h e  
environment.
8.9.2 E LECTRODIALYSIS
Electrodialysis consists of applying a direct current across a body of water separated into layers by 
membranes alternately permeable to cations and anions. Cations migrate toward the cathode and 
anions toward the anode. Cations and anions both enter one layer of water, and both leave the adja-
cent layer. Thus, layers of water enriched in salts alternate with those from which salts have been 
removed. The water in the brine-enriched layers is recirculated to a certain extent to prevent exces-
sive accumulation of brine. The principles involved in electrodialysis treatment are shown in 
Figure 8.9.
Fouling caused by various materials can cause problems with reverse osmosis treatment of water. 
Although the relatively small ions constituting the salts dissolved in wastewater readily pass through 
the membranes, large organic ions (proteins, for example) and charged colloids migrate to the mem-
brane surfaces, often fouling or plugging the membranes and reducing effi  ciency. In addition, 
growth of microorganisms on the membranes can cause fouling.Water Treatment 215
Experience with pilot plants indicates that electrodialysis has the potential to be a practical and 
economical method to remove up to 50% of the dissolved inorganics from secondary sewage effl  uent 
after pretreatment to eliminate fouling substances. Such a level of effi  ciency would permit repeated 
recycling of water without dissolved inorganic materials reaching unacceptably high levels.
8.9.3 R EVERSE  OSMOSIS
Reverse osmosis  is one of several pressure-driven membrane processes for water purifi  cation which 
also include nonfi  ltration, ultrafi  ltration, and microfi  ltration (Section 8.6). Reverse osmosis is a very 
useful and well-developed technique for the purifi  cation and desalination of water. As illustrated in 
Figure 8.10, it consists of forcing pure water through a semipermeable membrane that allows the 
 passage of water but not of other material. This process, which is not simply sieve separation or ultra-
fi ltration, depends on the preferential sorption of water on the surface of a porous cellulose acetate or 
polyamide membrane. Pure water from the sorbed layer is forced through pores in the membrane under 
pressure. If the thickness of the sorbed water layer is d, the pore diameter for optimum separation

should be 2 d. The optimum pore diameter depends upon the thickness of the sorbed pure water layer 
and may be several times the diameters of the solute and solvent molecules.
In an example of recycling that is in keeping with the practice of green chemistry, spent reverse 
osmosis membranes have been treated with potassium permanganate, which removes substances 
that clog the membranes, but also removes the salt-rejecting surface layer, drastically reducing their 
salt rejection properties. The treated membranes are then used for fi  ltration to remove as much as 
94% of suspended solids from water.
Nanofi  ltration is a pressurized membrane fi  ltration process that does not remove singly charged 
salt ions that are removed by osmosis, but may be effective in removing hardness (Ca2+). Nanofi  ltration 
operates at lower pressures than reverse osmosis, thus requiring less energy and less expense. 
Recently it has gained popularity as a drinking water treatment process.
8.9.4 P HOSPHORUS  REMOVAL
Advanced waste treatment normally requires removal of phosphorus to reduce algal growth. Algae 
may grow at PO43- levels as low as 0.05 mg/L. Growth inhibition requires levels well below 0.5 mg/L. 
Since municipal wastes typically contain approximately 25 mg/L of phosphate (as orthophosphates, 
polyphosphates, and insoluble phosphates), the effi  ciency of phosphate removal must be quite high to 
prevent algal growth. This removal may occur in the sewage treatment process (1) in the primary set-
tler, (2) in the aeration chamber of the activated sludge unit, or (3) after secondary waste treatment.
Activated sludge treatment removes about 20% of the phosphorus from sewage. Thus, an appre-
ciable fraction of largely biological phosphorus is removed with the sludge. Detergents and other 
sources contribute signifi  cant amounts of phosphorus to domestic sewage and considerable phos-
phate ion remains in the effl  uent. However, some wastes, such as carbohydrate wastes from sugar 
refi neries, are so defi  cient in phosphorus that supplementation of the waste with inorganic phospho-
rus is required for proper growth of the microorganisms degrading the wastes.
Under some sewage plant operating conditions, much greater than normal phosphorus removal has 
been observ ed. In such p lants, characterized b y hi gh DO and hi gh pH le v e ls in the aerati on tank, 
removal of 60–90% of the phosphorus has been attained, yielding two or three times the normal level 
of phosphorus in the sludge. In a conventionally operated aeration tank of an activated sludge plant, 
the CO2 level is relatively high because of the release of the gas by the degradation of organic material. 
A high CO2 level results in a relatively low pH, because of the weakly acidic nature of dissolved CO2 
in water. The aeration rate is generally not maintained at a very high level because oxygen is trans-
ferred relatively more effi  ciently from air when the DO levels in water are relatively low. Therefore, the 
aeration rate normally is not high enough to sweep out suffi  cient dissolved carbon dioxide to bring its 
concentration down to low levels. Thus, the pH generally is low enough that phosphate is maintained 
primarily in the form of the H2PO4- ion. However, at a higher rate of aeration in a relatively hard water, 
the CO2 is swept out, the pH rises, and reactions such as the following occur:
 5Ca2+ + 3HPO42- + H2O Æ Ca5OH(PO4)3 (s) + 4H+ (8.29)
The precipitated hydroxyapatite or other form of calcium phosphate is incorporated in the sludge 
fl oc. Reaction 8.29 is strongly hydrogen ion-dependent, and an increase in the hydrogen ion concen-
tration drives the equilibrium back to the left. Thus, under anaerobic conditions when the sludge 
medium becomes more acidic due to higher CO2 levels, the phosphate returns to solution.
Chemically, phosphate is most commonly removed by precipitation. Some common precipitants 
and their products are shown in Table 8.2. Precipitation processes are capable of at least 90–95% 
phosphorus removal at reasonable cost. Lime has the advantages of low cost and ease of regenera-
tion. The effi  ciency with which phosphorus is removed by lime is not as high as would be predicted 
by the low solubility of hydroxyapatite, Ca5OH(PO4)3. Some of the possible reasons for this are slow 
precipitation of Ca5OH(PO4)3, formation of nonsettling colloids; precipitation of  calcium as CaCO3 Water Treatment 217
in certain pH ranges, and the fact that phosphate may be present as condensed phosphates (poly-
phosphates) which form soluble complexes with calcium ion.
Lime, Ca(OH)2, is the chemical most commonly used for phosphorus removal:
 5Ca(OH)2 + 3HPO42- Æ Ca5OH(PO4)3(s) + 3H2O + 6OH- (8.30)
Phosphate can be removed from solution by adsorption on some solids, particularly activated alu-
mina, Al2O3. Removals of up to 99.9% of orthophosphate have been achieved with this method.
8.9.5 N ITROGEN  REMOVAL
Ne xt to phosphorus, ni trogen is the algal nutrient most commonl y remo v ed as part of adv anced 
wastewater treatment. Numerous chemical, biological, ion exchange, and membrane techniques can 
be used to remove nitrogen from water. Mineralization of organic nitrogen in wastewater treatment 
fi rst produces ammonium ion, NH4+. The most common chemical process for nitrogen removal from 
wastewater is reaction of nitrogen in the form of ammonium ion with hypochlorite (from chlorine) 
to produce elemental nitrogen that is evolved as a gas:
 NH4+ + HOCl Æ NH2Cl + H2O + H+ (8.31)
 2NH2Cl + HOCl Æ N2(g) + 3H+ + 3Cl-H2O (8.32)
Nitrifi  cation followed by denitrifi  cation is the most common biological means of removing 
in organic nitrogen from wastewater and arguably the most effective technique. The fi  rst step is an 
essentially complete conversion of ammonia and organic nitrogen to nitrate under strongly aerobic 
conditions, achieved by more extensive than normal aeration of the sewage:
 NH4+ + 2O2 (nitrifying bacteria) Æ NO3- + 2H+ + H2O (8.33)
The second step is the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas. This reaction is also bacterially catalyzed 
and requires a carbon source and a reducing agent such as methanol, CH3OH.
 6NO3- + 5CH3OH + 6H+ (denitrifying bacteria) Æ 3N2(g) + 5CO2 + 13H2O (8.34)
The denitrifi  cation process may be carried out either in a tank or on a carbon column. In pilot plant 
operation, conversions of 95% of the ammonia to nitrate and 86% of the nitrate to nitrogen have 
been achieved.TABLE 8.2

8.10 SLUDGE
Perhaps the most pressing water treatment problem at this time has to do with sludge collected or 
produced during water treatment. Finding a safe place to put the sludge or a use for it has proven 
troublesome, and the problem is aggravated by the large number of water treatment systems.
Some sludge is present in wastewater prior to treatment and may be collected from it. Such 
sludge includes human wastes, garbage grindings, organic wastes, and inorganic silt and grit from 
storm water runoff, and organic and inorganic wastes from commercial and industrial sources. 
There are two major kinds of sludge generated in a waste treatment plant. The fi  rst of these is 
organic sludge from activated sludge, trickling fi  lter, or rotating biological reactors. The second is 
inorganic sludge from the addition of chemicals, such as in phosphorus removal (see Section 8.9).
Most commonly, sewage sludge is subjected to anaerobic digestion in a digester designed to 
allow bacterial action to occur in the absence of air. This reduces the mass and volume of sludge and 
ideally results in the formation of a stabilized humus material. Disease agents are also destroyed in 
the process.
Following digestion, sludge is generally conditioned and thickened to concentrate and stabilize it 
and make it more amenable to removal of water. Relatively inexpensive processes, such as gravity 
thickening, may be employed to get the moisture content down to about 95%. Sludge may be further 
conditioned chemically by the addition of iron or aluminum salts, lime, or polymers.
S l udg e de w aterin g is emp l o y ed to con v ert the s l udg e from an essentiall y li qui d material to a 
damp solid containing not more than about 85% water. This may be accomplished on sludge drying 
beds consisting of layers of sand and gravel. Mechanical devices may also be employed, including 
vacuum fi  ltration, centrifugation, and fi  lter presses. Heat may be used to aid the drying process.
Ultimately, disposal of the sludge is required. Until banned by the U.S. Congress in the late 
1980s, ocean disposal of sewage sludge was commonly practiced. Currently, the two main alterna-
tives for sludge disposal are land spreading and incineration.
Rich in nutrients, waste sewage sludge contains around 5% N, 3% P, and 0.5% K on a dry-mass 
basis and can be used to fertilize and condition soil. The humic material in the sludge improves the 
physical properties and CEC of the soil. Possible accumulation of heavy metals is of some concern 
insofar as the use of sludge on cropland is concerned. Sewage sludge is an effi  cient heavy metals 
scavenger and may contain elevated levels of zinc, copper, nickel, and cadmium. These and other 
metals tend to remain immo b ilized in so il b y c he lati on wi th org ani c matter , adsorpti on on c la y 
minerals, and precipitation as insoluble compounds such as oxides or carbonates. However, increased 
application of sludge on cropland has caused distinctly elevated levels of zinc and cadmium in both 
leaves and grain of corn. Therefore, caution has been advised in heavy or prolonged application of 
sewage sludge to soil. Prior control of heavy metal contamination from industrial sources has greatly 
reduced the heavy metal content of sludge and enabled it to be used more extensively on soil.
A signifi  cant problem in sewage treatment can arise from sludge sidestreams. These consist of 
water removed from sludge by various treatment processes. Sewage treatment processes can be 
divided into mainstream treatment processes (primary clarifi  cation, trickling fi  lter, activated sludge, 
and rotating biological reactor ) and sidestream processes. During sidestream treatment, sludge is 
dewatered, degraded, and disinfected by a variety of processes, including gravity thickening, dis-
solved air fl  otation, anaerobic (anoxic) digestion, oxic digestion, vacuum fi  ltration, centrifugation, 
belt-fi  lter press fi  ltration, sand-drying-bed treatment, sludge-lagoon settling, wet air oxidation, and 
pressure fi  ltration. Each of these produces a liquid by-product sidestream which is circulated back 
to the mainstream. These add to the BOD and suspended solids of the mainstream.
A variety of chemical sludges are produced by various water treatment and industrial processes. 
Among the most abundant of such sludges is alum sludge produced by the hydrolysis of Al(III) salts 
used in the treatment of water, which creates gelatinous aluminum hydroxide:
 Al3+ + 3OH- (aq) Æ Al(OH)3 (s) (8.35)Water Treatment 219
Alum sludges containing aluminum hydroxide normally are 98% or more water and are very diffi  -
cult to dewater.
Both iron(II) and iron(III) compounds are used for the removal of impurities from wastewater by 
precipitation of Fe(OH)3. The sludge contains Fe(OH)3 in the form of soft, fl  uffy precipitates that are 
diffi cult to dewater beyond 10% or 12% solids.
The addition of either lime, Ca(OH)2, or quicklime, CaO, to water is used to raise the pH to about 
11.5 and cause the precipitation of CaCO3, along with metal hydroxides and phosphates. Calcium 
carbonate is readily recovered from lime sludges and can be recalcined to produce CaO, which can 
be recycled through the system.
Metal hydroxide sludges are produced in the removal of metals such as lead, chromium, nickel, and 
zinc from wastewater by raising the pH to such a level that the corresponding hydroxides or hydrated 
metal oxides are precipitated. The disposal of these sludges is a substantial problem because of their 
toxic heavy metal content. Reclamation of the metals is an attractive alternative for these sludges.
Pathogenic (disease-causing) microorganisms may persist in the sludge left from the treatment of 
sewage. These include bacteria such as Enterobacter  and Shigella , viruses including hepatitis and 
enteroviruses, protozoa such as Entamoeba  and Giardia , and helminth worms such as Ascaris  and 
Toxocara . Many of these organisms present potential health hazards, and there is risk of public 
exposure when the sludge is applied to soil. Therefore, it is necessary both to be aware of pathogenic 
microorganisms in municipal wastewater treatment sludge and to fi  nd a means of reducing the 
 hazards caused by their presence.
The most signifi  cant organisms in municipal sewage sludge include (1) indicators of fecal pollu-
tion, including fecal and total coliform, (2) pathogenic bacteria, including Salmonellae  and Shigellae , 
(3) enteric (intestinal) viruses, including enterovirus and poliovirus, and (4) parasites, such as 
Entamoeba histolytica  and Ascaris lumbricoides .
Several ways are recommended to signifi  can tl y red u ce l e v e ls o f path o g ens in se w ag e s l u d g e . 
Aerobic digestion involves aerobic agitation of the sludge for periods of 40−60 days (longer times 
are  e m p l o y ed  wi th  l o w  s l u d g e  te m pe ra ture s ) .  Air  dryin g  in v o l v e s  drainin g  an d/ o r  dryin g  o f  th e  
 liquid sludge for at least 3 months in a layer 20–25 cm thick. This operation may be performed on 
underdrained sand beds or in basins. Anaerobic digestion involves maintenance of the sludge in an 
anaerobic state for periods of time ranging from 60 days at 20°C to 15 days at temperatures exceed-
ing 35°C. Composting involves mixing dewatered sludge cake with bulking agents subject to decay, 
such as wood chips or shredded municipal refuse, and allowing the action of bacteria to promote 
decay at temperatures ranging up to 45–65°C. The higher temperatures tend to kill pathogenic bac-
teria. Finally, pathogenic organisms may be destroyed by lime stabilization in which suffi  cient lime 
is added to raise the pH of the sludge to 12 or higher.
8.11 WATER DISINFECTION
Chl orine i s the m os t co mm o nl y used di s inf ec tan t e mp l o y ed f or killin g b ac teri a in w ater . When 
chlorine is added to water, it rapidly hydrolyzes according to the reaction
 Cl2 + H2O Æ H+ + Cl- + HOCl (8.36)
which has the following equilibrium constant:

2[H ][Cl ][HOCl]K 4.5 10 .[Cl ]+-

 (8.37)
Hypochlorous acid, HOCl, is a weak acid that dissociates according to the reaction,
 +-+ /arrowpairrightleft HOCl H OCl (8.38)220 Environmental Chemistry
with an ionization constant of 2.7 × 10-8. From the above it can be calculated that the concentration 
of elemental Cl2 is negligible at equilibrium above pH 3 when chlorine is added to water at levels 
below 1.0 g/L.
Sometimes, hypochlorite salts are substituted for chlorine gas as a disinfectant. Calcium 
hypochlorite, Ca(OCl)2, is commonly used. The hypochlorites are safer to handle than gaseous 
chlorine.
The two chemical species formed by chlorine in water, HOCl and OCl-, are known as free avail-
able chlorine . Free available chlorine is very effective in killing bacteria. In the presence of ammo-
nia, monochloramine, dichloramine, and trichloramine are formed:
 NH4+ + HOCl Æ NH2Cl (monochloramine) + H2O + H+ (8.39)
 NH2Cl + HOCl Æ NHCl2 (dichloramine) + H2O (8.40)
 NHCl2 + HOCl Æ NCl3 (trichloramine) +  H2O (8.41)
The chloramines are called  combined available chlorine . Chlorination practice frequently pro-
vides for formation of combined available chlorine which, although a weaker disinfectant than 
free available chlorine, is more readily retained as a disinfectant throughout the water distribu-
tion system. Too much ammonia in water is considered undesirable because it exerts excess 
demand for chlorine.
At suffi  ci e n tl y  hi gh  Cl : N  ra ti o s  in  w a ter  co n tainin g  amm o ni a,  s o m e  H OCl  an d  OCl- remain 
unreacted, and a small quantity of NCl3 is formed. The ratio at which this occurs is called the break-
point . Chlorination beyond the breakpoint ensures disinfection. It has the additional advantage of 
destroying the more common materials that cause odor and taste in water.
A t  m o d e r a t e  l e v e l s  o f  N H3-N (approximately 20 mg/L), when the pH is between 5.0 and 8.0, 
 chlorination with a minimum 8:1 mass ratio of Cl to NH3-nitrogen produces effi  cient denitrifi  cation:
 NH4+ + HOCl Æ NH2Cl + H2O + H+ (8.39)
 2NH2Cl + HOCl Æ N2 (g) + 3H+ + 3Cl- + H2O (8.42)
This reaction is used to remo v e pollutant ammonia from w aste w ater . Ho w e v er , problems can 
arise from chlorination of organic wastes. Typical of such by-products is chloroform, produced by 
the chlorination of humic substances in water.
Chlorine is used to treat water other than drinking water. It is employed to disinfect effl  uent from 
sewage treatment plants, as an additive to the water in electric power plant cooling towers, and to 
control microorganisms in food processing.
8.11.1 C HLORINE  DIOXIDE
Chlorine dioxide , ClO2, is an effective water disinfectant that is of particular interest because, in the 
absence of impurity Cl2, it does not produce impurity THMs in water treatment. In acidic and 
 neutral water, respectively, the two half-reactions for ClO2 acting as an oxidant are the following:
 +- -++ + /arrowpairrightleft22ClO 4H 5 Cl 2H O e (8.43)
 --+/arrowpairrightleft22ClO ClO e (8.44)
In the neutral pH range, chlorine dioxide in water remains largely as molecular ClO2 until it 
contacts a reducing agent with which to react. Chlorine dioxide is a gas that is violently reactive Water Treatment 221
with organic matter and explosive when exposed to light. For these reasons, it is not shipped, 
but is generated on-site by processes such as the reaction of chlorine gas with solid sodium 
hypochlorite:
 ++ /arrowpairrightleft22 2 2NaClO ( ) Cl ( ) 2ClO ( ) 2NaCl ( ) sg g s (8.45)
A high content of elemental chlorine in the product may require its purifi  cation to prevent unwanted 
side reactions from Cl2.
As a water disinfectant, chlorine dioxide does not chlorinate or oxidize ammonia or other 
 nitrogen-containing compounds. Some concern has been raised over possible health effects of its 
main degradation by-products, ClO2- and ClO3-.
8.11.2 O ZONE AND OTHER OXIDANTS
Ozone  is sometimes used as a disinfectant in place of chlorine, particularly in Europe. Figure 8.11 
shows the main components of an ozone water treatment system. Basically, air is fi  ltered, cooled, 
dried, and pressurized, then subjected to an electrical discharge of approximately 20,000 V. The 
ozone produced is then pumped into a contact chamber where water contacts the ozone for 
10–15 min. Concern over possible production of toxic organochlorine compounds by water chlori-
nation processes has increased interest in ozonation. Furthermore, ozone is more destructive to 
viruses than is chlorine. Unfortunately, the solubility of ozone in water is relatively low, which 
 limits its disinfective power.
Ozone oxidizes water contaminants directly through the reaction of O3 and indirectly by generat-
ing hydroxyl radical, HO•, a reactive strong oxidant. A major consideration with ozone is the rate at 
which it decomposes spontaneously in water, according to the overall reaction,

FIGURE 8.11 Schematic diagram of a typical ozone water-treatment system.222 Environmental Chemistry
Because of the decomposition of ozone in water, some chlorine must be added to maintain disinfec-
tant throughout the water distribution system.
Iron(VI) in the form of ferrate ion, FeO42-, is a strong oxidizing agent with excellent disinfectant 
properties. It has the additional advantage of removing heavy metals, viruses, and phosphate. It may 
well fi  nd increased application for disinfection in the future.4
Another oxidant that is becoming widely used as a cleaning and bleaching agent in detergents 
and that, because of its oxidizing ability, probably has disinfecting abilities as well, is sodium 
 percarbonate. This solid, commonly called percarbonate ,  i s  p r od u ced  b y  mixin g  h y dr o g e n  pe r -
oxide, H2O2, with sodium carbonate, Na2CO3, along with MgSO4 and Na2SiO3 stabilizers to produce 
a stable solid with an approximate empirical formula of Na2CO3·3H2O2 in which the H2O2 may be 
stabilized by hydrogen bonding to CO32- ion. In water, this material releases oxygen and acts as a 
bleaching agent, detergent booster, and probably bactericide as well.
8.11.3 D ISINFECTION  WITH ULTRAVIOLET  RADIATION
Ultraviolet radiation, commonly represented as hn, is an effective disinfection agent that acts by 
direct breakage of chemical bonds in the biomolecules of pathogenic organisms and by generating 
reactive ions and radicals that destroy microorganisms. Ultraviolet radiation may be generated by 
high-powered mercury vapor lamps and solar radiation can be used as a source of ultraviolet radia-
tion. Because it is reagent-free, ultraviolet radiation is a particularly green means of water disinfec-
tion. It works well in combination with other disinfection agents, such as chlorine or ozone, and 
reduces the quantities of such agents required. Studies are underway on the use for water disinfec-
tion of titanium dioxide, TiO2, a photocatalytic material that can destroy pathogens when activated 
by ultraviolet radiation.
8.12 NATURAL WATER PURIFICATION PROCESSES
Virtually all of the materials that waste treatment processes are designed to eliminate may be 
absorbed by soil or degraded in soil.5 In fact, most of these materials are essential for soil fertility. 
Wastewater may provide the water that is essential to plant growth, in addition to the nutrients—
phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium—usually provided by fertilizers. Wastewater also contains 
essential trace elements and vitamins. Stretching the point a bit, the degradation of organic wastes 
provides the CO2 essential for photosynthetic production of plant biomass.
Soil may be viewed as a natural fi  lter for wastes. Most organic matter is readily degraded in soil 
and, in principle, soil constitutes an e x cellent primary , secondary , and tertiary treatment system 
for water. Soil has physical, chemical, and biological characteristics that can enable wastewater 
detoxifi  cation, biodegradation, chemical decomposition, and physical and chemical fi  xation. A 
number of soil characteristics are important in determining its use for land treatment of wastes. 
These characteristics include physical form, ability to retain water, aeration, organic content, acid–
base characteristics, and oxidation–reduction behavior. Soil is a natural medium for a number of 
living organisms that may have an effect upon biodegradation of wastewaters, including those that 
contain industrial wastes. Of these, the most important are bacteria, including those from the genera 
Agrobacterium , Arthrobacteri , Bacillus , Flavobacterium , and Pseudomonas . Actinomycetes and 
fungi are important in decay of vegetable matter and may be involved in biodegradation of wastes. 
Other unicellular organisms that may be present in or on soil are protozoa and algae. Soil animals, 
such as earthworms, affect soil parameters such as soil texture. The growth of plants in soil may 
have an infl  uence on its waste treatment potential in such aspects as uptake of soluble wastes and 
erosion control.
Early civilizations, such as the Chinese, used human organic wastes to increase soil fertility, and 
the practice continues today. The ability of soil to purify water was noted well over a century ago. 
In 1850 and 1852, J. Thomas Way, a consulting chemist to the Royal Agricultural Society in England, 
presented two papers to the Society entitled “Power of Soils to Absorb Manure.” Way’s experiments Water Treatment 223
showed that soil is an ion exchanger. Much practical and theoretical information on the ion exchange 
process resulted from his work.
If soil treatment systems are not properly designed and operated, odor can become an over-
powering problem. The author of this book is reminded of driving into a small town, recalled from 
some years before as a very pleasant place, and being assaulted with a virtually intolerable odor. The 
disgruntled residents pointed to a large spray irrigation system on a fi  eld in the distance—unfortu-
nately upwind—spraying liquifi  ed pig manure as part of an experimental feedlot waste treatment 
operation. The experiment was not deemed a success and was discontinued by the investigators, 
presumably before they met with violence from the local residents.
8.12.1 I NDUSTRIAL  WASTEWATER  TREATMENT  BY SOIL
Wastes that are amenable to land treatment are biodegradable organic substances, particularly those 
contained in municipal sewage and in wastewater from some industrial operations, such as food 
processing. However, through acclimation over a long period of time, soil bacterial cultures may 
develop that are effective in degrading normally recalcitrant compounds that occur in industrial 
wastewater. Acclimated microorganisms are found particularly at contaminated sites, such as those 
where soil has been exposed to crude oil for many years.
Soil used for land treatment must meet a number of criteria. It should be at least a meter thick 
because wastes that reach underlying rock strata tend to degrade poorly. The soil slope should be mod-
erate to reduce runoff. The water table should lie at a suffi  cient depth to avoid leaching into ground-
water. Treatment sites should be located at appropriate distances from dwellings or other anthrospheric 
constructs that could be adversely affected by exposure to wastes. Shallow cultivation of soil to which 
wastes have been applied promotes degradation by exposure to atmospheric oxygen.
Land treatment is most used for petroleum refi  ning wastes and is applicable to the treatment of 
fuels and wastes from leaking underground storage tanks. It can also be applied to biodegradable 
organic chemical wastes, including some organohalide compounds. Land treatment is not suitable 
for the treatment of wastes containing acids, bases, toxic inorganic compounds, salts, heavy metals, 
and organic compounds that are excessively soluble, volatile, or fl  ammable.
8.13 GREEN WATER
Much of the world including parts of the United States suffers from chronic shortages of water. 
Throughout history, water used by humans has come from freshwater groundwater and surface 
sources, relying on nature’s hydrologic cycle for purifi  cation to remove dissolved salt. Largely 
untapped is the more than 97% of earth’s water that is too saline to use, most of which is present in 
the oceans, but including signifi  cant amounts in underground saline aquifers. Assuming suffi  cient 
availability of affordable energy, these waters can be subjected to desalination  to provide freshwater 
suitable for human consumption and irrigation.
The two main means of water desalination are distillation and reverse osmosis. Distillation nor-
mally is carried out in several stages in which brine feedstock is heated to progressively higher 
temperatures as it is used to condense steam from each stage, the highest of which is heated by an 
external source. At each step, the heated brine is subjected to a lower pressure enabling more water 
to evaporate or “fl  ash” to produce steam that condenses in a heat exchanger cooled by incoming 
brine feed. This approach enables maximum effi  ciency of energy use. Because of the energy inten-
sity of this multistage distillation, it is usually combined with a power plant using otherwise waste 
heat from the power plant steam turbine outlet. An interesting possibility for small-scale water 
desalination is the use of solar power to heat the desalination units.
The world’s largest seawater distillation plant is the multistage fl  ash distillation unit in Shoaibi, 
Saudi Arabia, a nation that gets about 70% of its municipal water supplies from water desalination. 
This operation is combined with an oil-fi  red steam power plant, which uses the desalination plant 
for cooling and provides the heat needed for desalination.224 Environmental Chemistry
In addition to distillation, the other signifi  cant alternative for providing freshwater is reverse 
osmosis discussed in Section 8.9. Some communities in arid lands close to a seacoast get their fresh-
water from this source.
Both distillation and reverse osmosis produce concentrated brine by-products (retentate) that 
req uires dis posal . This materi al can be p umped b ac k in to the ocean or , in s o me cases, to deep 
underground saltwater aquifers. Some of it can also be evaporated, in some cases using solar energy, 
to yield a salt product with commercial value.
Some inland areas have large resources of saline groundwater (brackish water) that can be desal-
inated. An advantage of this source is that the salt level is often less than that of seawater, which 
makes the energy requirements relatively lower. Residue from purifi  cation of saline groundwater 
can be pumped back into the aquifer at a depth or location that does not contaminate the source. 
Utilization of saline groundwater could vastly increase the availability of water in many water-
defi cient areas.
8.13.1 R EUSE AND RECYCLING  OF WASTEWATER
The most readily available water source is wastewater discharged by municipalities, industrial con-
cerns, and even irrigation. Wastewater from municipal and industrial use usually requires treatment 
prior to discharge and it is relatively straightforward and inexpensive to remove inorganic and organic 
solutes from the water to make it suitable for use. It has an advantage over saline seawater or ground-
water in that its dissolved salt content is usually much less, lowering the cost of desalination.
Water reuse and recycling are becoming much more common as demands for water exceed supply. 
Unplanned reuse occurs as the result of waste effl  uents entering receiving waters or groundwater and 
subsequently being taken into a water distribution system. A typical example of unplanned water reuse 
occurs in London, which withdraws water from the Thames River that may have been through other 
water systems at least once, and which uses groundwater sources unintentionally recharged with 
 sewage effl  uents from a number of municipalities. Planned reuse utilizes wastewater treatment sys-
tems deliberately designed to bring water up to standards required for subsequent applications. The 
term direct reuse refers to water that has retained its identity from a previous application; reuse of 
water that has lost its identity is termed indirect reuse . The distinction also needs to be made between 
recycling and reuse. Recycling  occurs internally before water is ever discharged. An example is con-
densation of steam in a steam power plant followed by return of the steam to boilers. Reuse  occurs, for 
example, when water discharged by one user is taken as a water source by another user.
Reuse of water continues to grow because of two major factors. The fi  rst of these is lack of supply 
of water. The second is that widespread deployment of modern water treatment processes signifi  -
cantly enhances the quality of water available for reuse. These two factors come into play in semi-
arid regions in countries with advanced technological bases. For example, Israel, which is dependent 
upon irrigation for essentially all its agriculture, reuses about two-third of the country’s sewage 
effl uent for irrigation, whereas the United States, where water is relatively more available, uses only 
about 2–3% of its water for this purpose.
Since drinking water and water used for food processing require the highest quality of all large 
applications, intentional reuse for potable water is relatively less desirable, though widely practiced 
unintentionally or out of necessity. This leaves three applications with the greatest potential for reuse:
Irrigation for cropland, golf courses, and other applications requiring water for plant and • 
grass growth. This is the largest potential application for reused water and one that can 
take advantage of plant nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, in water.
Cooling and process water in industrial applications. For some industrial applications, rela-• 
tively low quality water can be used and secondary sewage effl  uent is a suitable source.
Groundwater recharge• . Groundwater can be recharged with reused water either by direct 
injection into an aquifer or by applying the water to land, followed by percolation into the Water Treatment 225
aquifer. The latter, especially, takes advantage of biodegradation and chemical sorption 
processes to further purify the water.
The major concern with recycled water is the potential presence of harmful pollutants. Water is 
readily disinfected to eliminate disease-causing bacteria. Viruses are more persistent, but can also 
be eliminated. Organic contaminants at very low levels may cause harm and can be very diffi  cult to 
eliminate. As discussed in Section 7.13, these contaminants can include pharmaceuticals and their 
metabolic products such as synthetic 17 a-ethinylestradiol and the natural hormone 17 b-estradiol, 
used in oral contraceptives; other endocrine disrupting species may be present as well.
It is inevitable that water recycling and reuse will continue to grow. This trend will increase the 
demand for water treatment, both qualitatively and quantitatively. In addition, it will require more 
careful consideration of the original uses of water to minimize water deterioration and enhance its 
suitability for reuse.
Figure 8.12 shows a system for reuse of water. Most of the water treatment processes discussed 
in this chapter may be utilized in purifying water for reuse and employed in an operation such as 
the one shown (see especially the physical/chemical wastewater purifi  cation system shown in 
Figure 8.5). The system shown in Figure 8.12 shows some of the main operations employed in a 
system for total water recycle and the applications of the purifi  ed water product. It takes secondary 
wastewater effl  uent from which most of the BOD has been removed by the activated sludge process 
and discharges it into wetlands where plants and algae grow profusely in the nutrient-rich water. 
This biomass has the potential to be harvested and utilized as a fuel or raw material using thermo-
chemical gasifi  cation or related measures. Depending upon geological conditions, signifi  cant 
amounts of water in the wetlands may infi  ltrate into groundwater, where it is purifi  ed further by 
natural processes underground. Water exiting the wetlands may be run over a bed of activated

carbon to remove organics. The water can also be subjected to highly effi  cient membrane fi  ltration 
processes including even reverse osmosis for removal of all salts. The solute-enriched retentate 
from treatment of water by membrane processes can be pumped into deep underground saline 
aquifers in some areas, discarded to the ocean in coastal regions (often with mixing with waste-
water or cooling water to dilute the impurities in the retentate), or evaporated to produce a solid or 
sludge residue that can be disposed.
The world’s largest water plant devoted to bringing sewage effl  uent up to a standard permitting 
potable uses began operation in the Orange County Water District in southern California in late 
2007. Known as the Groundwater Replenishment System this $481 million project is fed with 
 sewage treated by secondary wastewater treatment processes and pumps its clean water product into 
underground aquifers to serve as future municipal water sources and to prevent saltwater intrusion 
from the nearby ocean. Around 275 million liters per day of sewage effl  uent is fi  rst forced through 
microfi  lters to remove solids, then treated by reverse osmosis to remove dissolved salts, and fi  nally 
subjected to intense ultraviolet radiation to break down organic contaminants, especially pharma-
ceuticals and their metabolites before being discharged to underground aquifers. It is expected to 
serve as a model for similar installations around the world.
In coastal areas and on islands, a major advantage of upgrading wastewater to a standard that 
it can be injected into underground aquifers is the prevention of seawater intrusion into the aqui-
fers (Figure 8.13). As aquifers are pumped down, the lowered water level in the aquifer can 
enable infi  ltration of saline water, thus ruining the groundwater quality. Injection of treated 
wastewater into the aquifer can raise the water table in the aquifer to a level that prevents sea-
water intrusion.
8.14 WATER CONSERVATION
Water conservation , simply using less water, is one of the most effective, and clearly the fastest, 
means to ensure water supply. Water conservation falls into several major categories:
 1. Indoor and household water conservation practices
 2. Water-conserving devices and appliances
 3. Outdoor and landscaping water conservation
 4. Effi  cient irrigation practices
 5. Conservation in agricultural operations other than irrigation
 6. Water-effi  cient manufacturing

FIGURE 8.13 Injection of reclaimed water into underground aquifers in coastal areas can prevent seawater

Each of these categories is summarized briefl  y below.
Indoor and household water conservation practices are generally those simple measures that 
water consumers may implement to reduce use of water. Examples include sequential uses of water 
such as saving water from rinsing dishes to use for household cleaning, ensuring that there are no 
leaking faucets or toilet appliances, taking showers by fi  rst lathering one’s wet body without water 
fl owing followed by rinsing with water for the minimum length of time, minimizing the number and 
water volume of toilet fl  ushes, minimizing use of kitchen sink disposal devices for food waste dis-
posal, operating clothes washers and dishwashers only with full loads, and other common sense 
measures to reduce water use. Implementation of these measures is largely a matter of education and 
good environmental citizenship. In cases of real water shortage, force may be applied through the 
painful mechanism of sharply higher water utility rates.
A number of water-saving devices and appliances are available. These can be quite simple and 
cheap, such as aerators with fl  ow constrictors on faucets or showerheads, or they may be large and 
expensive such as low-water-consumption clothes washers that function well with cold water. Toilets 
that use minimal water per fl  ush are now mandated by law, although the less effective of these may 
actually increase water consumption when multiple fl  ushes are required. In public facilities, auto-
matically fl  ushing toilets and urinals are now commonplace, although some have the counter-
p r o d u c t i v e  t e n d e n c y  o f  p e r f o r m i n g  m u l t i p l e  a u t o m a t i c  fl  ushes for each instance of use. Instant 
in-line water heaters installed near faucet outlets can reduce water use by making it unnecessary to 
run the hot water faucet for some time to obtain hot water.
Water used for lawns and landscaping often is one of the greatest consumers of water. In some 
areas, such as public parks, purifi  ed wastewater is used for this purpose. In principle, water used in 
some househo ld app licati ons can be recy c led to w ater y ard p lants or grass. Some o f the greater 
 savings can be achieved in this area by growing ground cover and plants that require minimal water. 
This may mean planting native grass species that can withstand drought without much watering. In 
extreme cases, yards have been converted to gravel cover. Mulching with materials such as tree bark 
or grass clippings can reduce water use signifi  cantly.
Irrigation of agricultural crops is one of the largest consumers of water and one that is amenable 
to conservation. Spray irrigation devices lose large quantities of water to evaporation and should be 
replaced by systems that do not spray the water into the air. The ultimate in irrigation effi  ciency is 
drip irrigation that applies minimum quantities of water directly to the plant roots. Application of 
excess water in irrigation should be minimized. However, particularly in areas that rarely receive 
enough rain to fl  ush the soil, application of minimal amounts of irrigation water can result in harm-
ful accumulation of salts in the soil.
Livestock production and processing agricultural products use large amounts of water. The pro-
duction of l kg of beef requires around 20,000 L of water, including the water required to grow the 
grain that the animal eats. About 6000 L of water are required to produce 1 kg of chicken meat. 
Signifi  cantly less water is needed to produce an equivalent amount of vegetable protein. The pro-
duction of fuel ethanol from the fermentation of sugar from corn requires relatively large amounts 
of water. Choices made in the kinds of agricultural products produced for market have important 
implications for water conservation.
Manufacturing can be very water-intensive. The manufacture of a single automobile requires 
around 150,000 L of water. Refi  ning crude oil to petroleum requires approximately 44 times the 
volume of water as the gasoline produced. The conservation of water in manufacturing and com-
mercial activities is an important aspect of industrial ecology (see Chapter 17).
8.15 PROTECTING WATER SUPPLIES FROM ATTACK
The fact that drinking water is distributed centrally to large numbers of people makes water systems 
a concern to terrorist threats. History abounds with examples of large populations devastated by 
contaminated water supplies that caused diseases such as cholera and typhoid. In modern times, 228 Environmental Chemistry
contaminated water in developing countries causes outbreaks of debilitating and often fatal dysen-
tery, a leading cause of mortality in infants and children in some areas. Even in industrialized 
countries in modern times, drinking water contamination can cause illness and even fatalities. For 
example, in 1993 contamination of the Milwaukee water system by the protozoan Cryptosporidium 
parvum  caused illness in over 400,000 people, more than 50 of whom died as a result.
Deliberate chemical contamination of an entire water system is an unlikely, but not impossible, 
event. Incidents have been recorded in which terrorist groups attempted to obtain cyanide salts, 
 presumably with the objective of poisoning water supplies. Toxins from microorganisms are likely 
weapons of groups wishing to poison water. The most toxic of these is the botulinus toxin, an 
astoundingly poisonous substance produced by Botulinus  bacteria. Direct contamination by  bacteria 
is possible. The most likely candidates are Bacillus anthracis , Shigella dysenteriae , Vibriocholerae , 
and Yersiniapestis . Waterborne strains of Escherichia coli  bacteria that produce the shiga toxin (the 
toxin produced by Shigelladysenteriae ) continue to cause fatal infections in the United States from 
time to time. Shiga-producing E. coli  in the municipal water supply of Walkerton, Ontario, Canada, 
caused approximately 3000 people to become ill and seven to die in May 2000. In an incident sug-
gestive of the potential for terrorist attack, 12 staff of a laboratory of a large medical center devel-
oped acute diarrheal illness requiring hospitalization of four of the victims due to infection by 
Shigelladysenteriae . Cultures taken from the victims were found to be identical to those found on 
doughnuts or muffi  ns that they had eaten in the facility break room and to a culture of 
Shigelladysenteriae  maintained in the laboratory, a portion of which was missing. This led to the 
conclusion that the contamination was deliberate.6
Fortunately, water supplies are not particularly vulnerable to attack. It would be rather diffi  cult 
to infi  ltrate a water treatment system, and injecting a toxic substance into the water distribution 
system beyond the treatment plant is unlikely. Vulnerability to infectious microbial agents is greatly 
reduced by maintaining a disinfectant chlorine residual in the system. Some of the likely chemical 
agents hydrolyze in water or are destroyed by the action of chlorine, and their effects are reduced by 
the great dilution provided by water systems that distribute huge quantities of water. Even in the 
event of contamination of a water supply, provision of relatively small quantities of bottled water for 
drinking would reduce the hazard to very low levels. Prudence dictates that water supply, treatment, 
and distribution systems be maintained in a secure state and monitored for likely agents of attack, 
but water systems need not be the subject of undue concern.

Atmospheric Chemistry
9.1 INTRODUCTION
The atmosphere consists of the thin layer of mixed gases covering the Earth’s surface. Exclusive of 
water, atmospheric air is 78.1% (by volume) nitrogen, 21.0% oxygen, 0.9% argon, and 0.04% carbon 
dioxide. Normally, air contains 1–3% water vapor by volume. In addition, air contains a large  variety 
of trace level gases below 0.002%, including neon, helium, methane, krypton, nitrous oxide, hydro-
gen, xenon, sulfur dioxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, ammonia, and carbon monoxide. The atmo-
sphere behaves as it does as a consequence of the gases in it from both natural and anthropogenic 
sources and the physical forces acting on it.
The atmosphere is divided into several layers on the basis of temperature. Of these, the most 
signifi  cant are the troposphere extending in altitude from the Earth’s surface to approximately 
11 km, and the stratosphere from about 11  km to approximately 50  km. Atmospheric stratifi  cation 
is discussed in more detail in Section 9.3.
9.1.1 P HOTOCHEMISTRY  AND SOME IMPORTANT  TERMS
Various aspects of the environmental chemistry of the atmosphere are discussed in Chapters 9 
through 14. Important aspects of atmospheric chemistry include effects of solar radiation leading to 
photolysis of trace gases and photooxidation of oxidizable trace gases in the troposphere. The most 
signifi  cant feature of atmospheric chemistry is the occurrence of photochemical reactions  resulting 
from the absorption by molecules of photons of electromagnetic radiation from the sun, mostly in 
the ultraviolet region of the spectrum.1 Photochemical reactions and photochemistry are discussed 
in more detail in Section 9.8. However, it is important to defi  ne several key aspects of photochem-
istry at this point to enable understanding of the rest of the material in this chapter.
The meaning of • hn: The energy, E, of a photon of visible or ultraviolet light is given by the 
equation, E = hn, where h is Planck’s constant and n is the frequency of electromagnetic 
inversely proportional to its wavelength, l. The involvement of a photon in a photochemi-
cal reaction is shown by the following reaction with ozone, O3:
 O3 + hn (l < 420 nm) Æ O* + O2 (9.1)
 Ultraviolet radiation has a higher frequency than visible light and is, therefore, more ener-
getic and more likely to break chemical bonds in molecules that absorb it.
Excited state• , *: The product of a photochemical reaction may be electronically energized 
in an excited state commonly denoted with an asterisk, *, as shown for the excited oxygen 
atom, O*, above. This excess electronic energy may make the excited species chemically 
more reactive.234 Environmental Chemistry
Free radicals•  containing an unpaired electron denoted with a dot, ∑: Reaction of an excited 
oxygen atom with a molecule of water vapor,
 O* + H2O Æ HO∑ + HO∑ (9.2)
 produces two hydroxyl radicals, HO∑. Because of the strong pairing tendency of electrons, 
free radicals are normally highly reactive and cause most of the important chemical 
 processes that occur in the atmosphere.
Third body, M• : An important reaction in the stratosphere is that between an oxygen atom 
and an O2 molecule
 O + O2 + M Æ O3 + M (9.3)
 to produce stratospheric ozone. In this reaction, M is a third body, almost always a  molecule 
of O2 or N2, that absorbs the energy released in the reaction, which otherwise would cause 
the product molecule to fall apart.
9.1.2  ATMOSPHERIC  COMPOSITION
Dry air up to several kilometers altitude consists of two major components
Nitrogen 78.08% (by volume)• 
Oxygen 20.95%• 
and two minor components
Argon 0.934%• 
Carbon dioxide 0.039%• 
in addition to argon, four more noble gases ,
Neon 1.818 • ¥ 10-3%
Krypton 1.14 • ¥ 10-4%
Helium 5.24 • ¥ 10-4%
Xenon 8.7 • ¥ 10-6%
and trace gases  as given in Table 9.1. Atmospheric air may contain 0.1–5% water by volume, with a 
normal range of 1–3%.
9.1.3 G ASEOUS  OXIDES IN THE ATMOSPHERE
Oxides of carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen are important constituents of the atmosphere and are pollut-
ants at higher levels. Of these, carbon dioxide, CO2, is the most abundant. It is a natural atmospheric 
constituent, and it is required for plant growth. However, the level of carbon dioxide in the atmo-
sphere, now at about 390  ppm by volume, is increasing by about 2  ppm per year. As discussed in 
Chapter 14, this increase in atmospheric CO2 may well cause general atmospheric warming—the 
“greenhouse effect,” with potentially very serious consequences for the global atmosphere and for 
life on Earth. Although not a global threat, carbon monoxide, CO, can be a serious health threat 
because it prevents blood from transporting oxygen to body tissues.
The two most serious nitrogen oxide air pollutants are nitric oxide, NO, and nitrogen dioxide, 
NO2, collectively denoted as “NOx.” These tend to enter the atmosphere as NO, and photochemical 
processes in the atmosphere can convert NO to NO2. Further reactions can result in the formation 
of corrosive nitrate salts or nitric acid, HNO3. Nitrogen dioxide is particularly signifi  cant in atmo-
spheric chemistry because of its photochemical dissociation by light with a wavelength <430 nm to 
produce highly reactive O atoms. This is the fi  rst step in the formation of photochemical smog (see 
below). Sulfur dioxide, SO2, is a reaction product of the combustion of sulfur-containing fuels such The Atmosphere and Atmospheric Chemistry 235
as high-sulfur coal. Part of this sulfur dioxide is converted in the atmosphere to sulfuric acid, 
H2SO4, normally the predominant contributor to acid precipitation.
9.1.4 A TMOSPHERIC  METHANE
The most abundant hydrocarbon in the atmosphere is methane, CH4, released from underground 
sources as natural gas and produced by the fermentation of organic matter. Methane is one of the least 
reactive atmospheric hydrocarbons and is produced by diffuse sources, so that its role in producing 
intense regionalized incidents of air pollution is limited. However, because of its presence throughout 
the atmosphere and despite its relatively low reactivity, it is a major factor in atmospheric chemical 
processes. Information gathered from ice cores has shown that during the last 250 years levels of 
atmospheric methane have more than doubled as the result of fossil fuel utilization, agricultural prac-
tices (particularly cultivation of rice in which methane is evolved from anoxic bacteria growing in 
waterlogged soil), and waste fermentation. Per molecule, methane is a much more effective green-
house gas than is carbon dioxide. Methane affects both tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry, 
particularly by infl  uencing levels of hydroxyl radical, ozone, and stratospheric water vapor.TABLE 9.1

9.1.5  HYDROCARBONS  AND PHOTOCHEMICAL  SMOG
The most signifi  cant atmospheric pollutant hydrocarbons are the reactive ones produced as automo-
bile exhaust emissions. In the presence of NO, under conditions of temperature inversion (see 
Chapter 11), low humidity, and sunlight, these hydrocarbons produce undesirable photochemical 
smog  manifested by the presence of visibility-obscuring particulate matter, oxidants such as ozone, 
and noxious organic species such as aldehydes.
9.1.6  PARTICULATE  MATTER
Particles ranging from aggregates of a few molecules to pieces of dust readily visible to the naked 
eye are commonly found in the atmosphere and are discussed in detail in Chapter 10. Some atmos-
pheric particles, such as sea salt formed by the evaporation of water from droplets of sea spray, are 
natural and even benefi  cial atmospheric constituents. Very small particles called condensation nuclei  
serve as bodies for atmospheric water vapor to condense upon and are essential for the formation of 
rain drops. Colloidal-sized particles in the atmosphere are called aerosols . Those formed by grinding 
up bulk matter are known as dispersion aerosols , whereas particles formed from  chemical reactions 
of gases are condensation aerosols ; the latter tend to be smaller. Smaller particles are in general 
the most harmful because they have a greater tendency to scatter light and are the most respirable-
(tendency to be inhaled into the lungs).
Much of the mineral particulate matter in a polluted atmosphere is in the form of oxides and other 
compounds produced during the combustion of high-ash fossil fuel. Smaller particles of fl y  a s h  enter 
furnace fl  ues and are effi  ciently collected in a properly equipped stack system. However, some fl  y ash 
escapes through the stack and enters the atmosphere. Unfortunately, the fl  y ash thus released tends to 
consist of smaller particles that do the most damage to human health, plants, and visibility.
9.1.7 P RIMARY  AND SECONDARY  POLLUTANTS
Primary pollutants  in the atmosphere are those that are emitted directly. An example of a primary 
pollutant is sulfur dioxide, SO2, which directly harms vegetation and is a lung irritant. Of greater 
importance in most cases are secondary pollutants  that are formed by atmospheric chemical pro-
cesses acting upon primary pollutants and even nonpollutant species in the atmosphere. Secondary 
pollutants are generally produced by the natural tendency of the atmosphere to oxidize trace gases 
in it. Secondary pollutant sulfuric acid, H2SO4, is generated by the oxidation of primary pollutant 
SO2 and secondary pollutant NO2 is produced when the primary pollutant NO is oxidized. One of 
the most important secondary pollutants in the troposphere is ozone, O3, for which the primary raw 
material is atmospheric oxygen, O2. Pollutant levels of ozone are produced in the troposphere by 
photochemical processes in the presence of hydrocarbons and NOx (NO + NO2) as discussed in 
Chapter 13. Another important kind of secondary pollutant consists of particulate matter generated 
by atmospheric chemical reactions operating on gaseous primary pollutants.
9.2 IMPORTANCE OF THE ATMOSPHERE
The atmosphere is a protective blanket that nurtures life on Earth and protects it from the hostile 
environment of outer space. The atmosphere is the source of carbon dioxide for plant photosynthesis 
and of oxygen for respiration. It provides the nitrogen that nitrogen-fi  xing bacteria and ammonia-
manufacturing plants use to produce chemically bound nitrogen, an essential component of life 
molecules. As a basic part of the hydrologic cycle (Figure 3.1) the atmosphere transports water from 
the oceans to land, thus acting as the condenser in a vast solar-powered still. Unfortunately, the 
atmosphere also has been used as a dumping ground for many pollutant materials—ranging from 
sulfur dioxide to refrigerant Freon—a practice that causes damage to vegetation and materials, 
shortens human life, and alters the characteristics of the atmosphere itself.The Atmosphere and Atmospheric Chemistry 237
In its essential role as a protective shield, the atmosphere absorbs most of the cosmic rays from 
outer space and protects organisms from their effects. It also absorbs most of the electromagnetic 
radiation from the sun, allowing transmission of signifi  cant amounts of radiation only in the regions 
of 300–2500  nm (near-ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared radiation) and 0.01–40  m (radio waves). 
By absorbing electromagnetic radiation below 300  nm, the atmosphere fi  lters out damaging ultra-
violet radiation that would otherwise be very harmful to living organisms. Furthermore, because it 
reabsorbs much of the infrared radiation by which absorbed solar energy is re-emitted to space, the 
atmosphere stabilizes the Earth’s temperature, preventing the tremendous temperature extremes 
that occur on planets and moons lacking substantial atmospheres.
9.3 PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ATMOSPHERE
Atmospheric science  deals with the movement of air masses in the atmosphere, atmospheric heat 
balance, and atmospheric chemical composition and reactions. In order to understand atmospheric 
chemistry and air pollution, it is important to have an overall appreciation of the atmosphere, its 
composition, and physical characteristics as discussed in the fi  rst parts of this chapter.
9.3.1  VARIATION  OF PRESSURE  AND DENSITY  WITH ALTITUDE
As anyone who has exercised at high altitudes well knows, the density of the atmosphere decreases 
sharply with increasing altitude as a consequence of the gas laws and gravity. More than 99% of the 
total mass of the atmosphere is found within approximately 30  km (about 20 mile) of the Earth’s 
surface. Such an altitude is miniscule compared to the Earth’s diameter, so it is not an exaggeration 
to characterize the atmosphere as a “tissue-thin” protective layer. In fact, if Earth were a globe the 
size of one typically seen in a geography classroom, the greater part of the atmosphere upon which 
humankind is absolutely dependent for its existence would be of a thickness only about that of the 
coat of varnish on the globe! Although the total mass of the global atmosphere is huge, approxima-
tely 5.14  ¥ 1015 metric tons, it is still only about one-millionth of the Earth’s total mass.
The fact that atmospheric pressure decreases as an approximately exponential function of altitude 
largely determines the characteristics of the atmosphere. Ideally, in the absence of mixing and at a 
constant absolute temperature, T, the pressure at any given height, Ph, is given in the exponential form
 Ph = P0e-Mgh / RT (9.4)
where P0 is the pressure at zero altitude (sea level), M is the average molar mass of air (28.97  g/mol 
in the troposphere), g is the acceleration of gravity (981  cm/s2 at sea level), h is the altitude in cm, 
and R is the gas constant (8.314  ¥ 107 erg/deg/mol). These units are given in the cgs (centimeter-
gram-second) system for consistency; altitude can be converted to meter or kilometer as appropriate.
The factor RT/Mg is defi  ned as the scale height , which represents the increase in altitude by 
which the pressure drops by e-1. At an average sea-level temperature of 288  K, the scale height is 
8 ¥ 105 cm or 8  km; at an altitude of 8  km, the pressure is only about 39% of that at sea level.
Conversion of Equation 9.4 to the logarithmic (base 10) form and expression of h in km yields
 ¥=-5
h010log log2.303MghPPRT (9.5)
and taking the pressure at sea level to be exactly 1  atm gives the following expression:
 ¥=-5
h10log2.303MghPRT (9.6) 238 Environmental Chemistry
Plots of Ph and temperature versus  altitude are shown in Figure 9.1. The plot of Ph is nonlinear 
because of variations arising from nonlinear variations in temperature with altitude that are dis-
cussed later in this section and from the mixing of air masses.
The characteristics of the atmosphere vary widely with altitude, time (season), location (latitude), 
and even solar activity. Extremes of pressure and temperature are illustrated in Figure 9.1. At very 
high altitudes, normally reactive species such as atomic oxygen, O, persist for long periods of time. 
That occurs because the pressure is very low at these altitudes such that the distance traveled by a 
reactive species before it collides with a potential reactant—its mean free path—is quite high. A 
particle with a mean free path of 1  ¥ 10-6 cm at sea level has a mean free path greater than 1  ¥ 106 cm 
at an altitude of 500  km, where the pressure is lower by many orders of magnitude. 
9.3.2  STRATIFICATION  OF THE ATMOSPHERE
As shown in Figure 9.2, the atmosphere is stratifi  ed on the basis of the temperature/density rela-
tionships resulting from interactions between physical and photochemical processes in air. The 
lowest layer of the atmosphere extending from sea level to an altitude of 10–16  km is the tropos-
phere , characterized by a generally homogeneous composition of major gases other than water and 
 decreasing temperature with increasing altitude. To understand why the temperature decreases 
with increasing altitude in the troposphere, consider a hypothetical mass of air at the surface rising 
to higher altitudes in the troposphere. As the air rises, it expands, doing work on its surroundings 
so that its temperature must fall. The extent of the temperature decrease  for dry air  with increasing 
altitude is known as the adiabatic lapse rate , which has a value of 9.8  K/km. However, air contains 
water vapor that condenses as the air mass rises, releasing heat of vaporization and lowering the 
lapse rate to an average of about 6.5  km-1. The upper limit of the troposphere, which has a tempe-
rature minimum of about -56∞C, varies in altitude by a kilometer or more with atmospheric 
 temperature, underlying terrestrial surface, latitude, and time. The homogeneous composition of 
the troposphere results from constant mixing by convection currents in air masses, driven by the 
unstable situation with colder air above warmer air (the name of the troposphere is based on the 
Greek tropos  for mixing). However, the water vapor content of the troposphere is extremely  variable 
because of cloud formation, precipitation, and evaporation of water from terrestrial water bodies.–100 –80 –60 –40 –20 0Temperature, °C

The very cold tropopause  layer at the top of the troposphere serves as a barrier that causes water 
vapor to condense to ice so that it cannot reach altitudes at which it would photodissociate through 
the action of intense high-energy ultraviolet radiation. If this happened, the hydrogen produced 
would escape the Earth’s atmosphere and be lost. (Much of the hydrogen and helium gases origi-
nally present in the Earth’s atmosphere were lost by this process.)
The atmospheric layer directly above the troposphere is the stratosphere , in which the tempera-
ture rises to a maximum of about -2∞C with increasing altitude. The increasing temperature with 
higher altitude in this region results in very little vertical mixing (the name stratosphere is based on 
the Greek stratus  for mixing). This phenomenon is due to the presence of ozone, O3, which may 
reach a level of around 10  ppm by volume in the mid-range of the stratosphere. The heating effect is 
caused by the absorption of ultraviolet radiation energy by ozone, a phenomenon discussed later in 
this chapter.
The absence of high levels of radiation-absorbing species in the mesosphere  immediately above 
the stratosphere results in a further temperature decrease to about -92∞C  a t  an  al ti tu d e  ar o un d

which molecules and ions can completely escape the atmosphere. Extending to the far outer reaches 
of the atmosphere is the thermosphere , in which the highly rarifi  ed gas reaches temperatures as high FIGURE 9.2 Major regions of the atmosphere (not to scale).

9.4 ENERGY TRANSFER IN THE ATMOSPHERE
The physical and chemical characteristics of the atmosphere and the critical heat balance of Earth are 
determined by energy and mass transfer processes in the atmosphere. Energy transfer phenomena are 
addressed in this section and mass transfer in Section 9.4. Incoming solar energy is largely in the vis-
ible region of the spectrum. The shorter wavelength blue solar light is scattered relatively more strongly 
by molecules and particles in the upper atmosphere, which is why the sky appears blue as it is viewed 
by scattered light and appears red by transmitted light, particularly around sunset and sunrise and 
when the atmosphere contains a high level of particles. The solar energy fl  ux reaching the atmosphere 
is huge, amounting to 1.34  ¥ 103 W/m2 (19.2  kcal/min/m2) perpendicular to the line of solar fl  ux at the 
top of the atmosphere, as illustrated in Figure 9.3. This value is the solar constant , and may be termed 
insolation , which stands for “incoming solar radiation.” This energy must be radiated back into space, 
and a delicate energy balance is involved in maintaining the Earth’s temperature within very narrow 
limits that enable conditions of climate that support present levels of life on Earth. The great climate 
changes that resulted in past ice ages lasting thousands of years alternating with long periods of tropi-
cal conditions were caused by variations of only a few degrees in average temperature. Marked climate 
changes within recorded history have been marked by much smaller average temperature changes. 
The mechanisms by which the Earth’s average temperature is retained within its present narrow range 
are complex and still the topic of intensive study, but the main features are explained here.2
About half of the solar radiation entering the atmosphere reaches the Earth’s surface either 
directly or after scattering by clouds, atmospheric gases, or particles. The remaining half of the 
radiation is either refl  ected directly back or absorbed in the atmosphere, and its energy radiated back 
into space at a later time as infrared radiation. Most of the solar energy reaching the surface is 
absorbed and is returned to space to maintain heat balance. In addition, a very small amount of 
FIGURE 9.3 The solar fl  ux at the distance of Earth from the sun is 1.34 ¥ 103 W/m2.Sun

energy ( <1% of that received from the sun) reaches the Earth’s surface by convection and conduction 
processes from the Earth’s hot mantle, and this, too, must be lost.
Energy transport, which is crucial to eventual reradiation of energy from Earth, is accomplished 
by three major mechanisms. These are conduction, convection, and radiation. Conduction  of energy 
occurs through the interaction of adjacent atoms or molecules without the bulk movement of matter 
and is a relatively slow means of transferring energy in the atmosphere. Convection involves the 
movement of whole masses of air, which may be either relatively warm or cold. It is the mechanism 
by which abrupt temperature variations occur when large masses of air move across an area. Besides 
carrying sensible heat  due to the kinetic energy of molecules, convection carries latent heat in the 
f orm of water vapor , which releases heat as it condenses. An appreciable fraction of the Earth ’ s 
surface heat is transported to clouds in the atmosphere by conduction and convection before being 
lost ultimately by radiation.
Radiation  of energy in the Earth’s atmosphere occurs through electromagnetic radiation. 
Electromagnetic radiation is the only way in which energy is transmitted through a vacuum; there-
fore, it is the means by which all of the energy that must be lost from the planet to maintain its heat 
balance is ultimately returned to space. The maximum intensity of incoming radiation is at 0.5  mm 
(500 nm) in the visible region, with essentially none outside the range of 0.2–3  mm. This range encom-
passes the whole visible region and small parts of the ultraviolet and infrared adjacent to it. Outgoing 
radiation is in the infrared region, with maximum intensity at about 10  mm, primarily between 2 and 
40 μm. Thus Earth loses energy by electromagnetic radiation of a much longer wavelength (lower 
energy per photon) than the radiation by which it receives energy, a crucial factor in maintaining the 
Earth’s heat balance, and one susceptible to upset by human activities.
9.4.1  THE EARTH’S RADIATION  BUDGET  
The Earth’s radiation budget is illustrated in Figure 9.4. The average surface temperature is main-
tained at a relatively comfortable 15 ∞C because of an atmospheric “greenhouse effect” in which 
water vapor and, to a lesser extent, carbon dioxide reabsorb much of the outgoing radiation and 
reradiate about half of it back to the surface. Were this not the case, the surface temperature would 
average around -18∞C. Most of the absorption of infrared radiation is done by water molecules in 
the atmosphere. Absorption is weak in the regions 7–8.5 and 11–14  μm, and nonexistent between 
8.5 and 11  μm, leaving a “hole” in the infrared absorption spectrum through which radiation may 
escape. Carbon dioxide, though present at a much lower concentration than water vapor, absorbs 
strongly between 12 and 16.3  μm, and plays a key role in maintaining the heat balance. There is 
concern that an increase in the carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere could prevent suffi  cient 
energy loss to cause a perceptible and damaging increase in the Earth’s temperature. This phenom-
enon, discussed in more detail in Section 9.7 and Chapter 14, is popularly known as the greenhouse 
effect  and may occur from elevated CO2 levels caused by increased use of fossil fuels and the 
destruction of photosynthesizing trees in forests.
An important aspect of solar radiation that reaches the Earth’s surface is the percentage refl  ected 
from the surface, described as albedo . Albedo is important in determining the Earth’s heat balance in 
that absorbed radiation heats the surface and refl  ected radiation does not. Albedo varies spectacularly 
with the surface. At the two extremes, freshly fallen snow has an albedo of 90% because it refl  ects 
9/10th of incoming radiation, whereas freshly plowed black topsoil has an albedo of only about 2.5%.
9.5 ATMOSPHERIC MASS TRANSFER, METEOROLOGY, AND WEATHER
Meteorology  is the science of atmospheric phenomena, encompassing the study of the movement of 
air masses as well as physical forces in the atmosphere—heat, wind, and transitions of water, pri-
marily liquid to vapor or vice versa .3 Meteorological phenomena affect, and in turn are affected by, 
the chemical properties of the atmosphere. Meteorological phenomena determine whether or not 242 Environmental Chemistry

pollutants emitted from a point source such as a power plant stack rise in the atmosphere and are 
dispersed or settle near the source where they may do maximum harm. Los Angeles largely owes 
its susceptibility to smog to the meteorology of the Los Angeles basin, which holds hydrocarbons 
and nitrogen oxides long enough to cook up an unpleasant brew of photochemical smog (Chapter 
13). Short-term variations in the state of the atmosphere constitute weather defi ned in terms of seven 
closely interrelated major factors: temperature, clouds, winds, humidity, horizontal visibility (as 
affected by fog, etc.), type and quantity of precipitation, and atmospheric pressure. Longer-term 
variations and trends within a particular geographical region in those factors that compose weather 
are described as climate , a term defi  ned and discussed in Section 9.6.
9.5.1 A TMOSPHERIC  WATER IN ENERGY  AND MASS TRANSFER
The driving force behind weather and climate is the distribution and ultimate reradiation to space of 
solar energy. A large fraction of solar energy is converted to latent heat by evaporation of water into the 
atmosphere. As water condenses from atmospheric air, large quantities of heat are released. This is a 
particularly signifi  cant means for transferring energy from the ocean to land. Solar energy falling on the 
ocean is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water, then the water vapor moves inland where 
it condenses. The latent heat released when th e water condenses warms the surrounding land mass.
Atmospheric water can be present as vapor, liquid, or ice. The water vapor content of air can be 
expressed as humidity . Relative humidity , expressed as a percentage, describes the amount of water 
vapor in the air as a ratio of the maximum amount that the air can hold at that temperature. Air with 
a given relative humidity can undergo any of several processes to reach the saturation point at which 
water vapor condenses in the form of rain or snow. For this condensation to happen, air must be 
cooled below a temperature called the dew point , and condensation nuclei  must be present. These 
nuclei are hygroscopic substances such as salts, sulfuric acid droplets, and some organic materials, 
including bacterial cells. Air pollution in some forms is an important source of condensation nuclei.
The liquid water in the atmosphere is present largely in clouds . Clouds normally form when ris-
ing, adiabatically cooling air can no longer hold water in the vapor form and the water forms very 
small aerosol droplets. Clouds may be classifi  ed into three major forms. Cirrus clouds occur at great 
altitudes and have a thin feathery appearance. Cumulus clouds are detached masses with a fl  at base 
and frequently a “bumpy” upper structure. Stratus clouds occur in large sheets and may cover all of 
the sky visible from a given point as overcast. Clouds are important absorbers and refl  ectors of 
radiation (heat). Their formation is affected by the products of human activities, especially particu-
late matter pollution and emission of deliquescent gases such as SO2 and HCl. Some atmospheric 
chemical processes occur in solution in cloud droplets and crystalline ice particles in stratospheric 
clouds act as reservoirs for ozone-destroying chlorine species (see Section 14.5).
The formation of precipitation from the very small droplets of water that compose clouds is a com-
plicated and important process. Cloud droplets normally take somewhat longer than a minute to form 
by condensation. They average about 0.04  mm across and do not exceed 0.2  mm in  diameter. Raindrops 
range from 0.5 to 4  mm in diameter. Condensation processes do not form particles large enough to fall 
as precipitation (rain, snow, sleet, or hail). The small condensation droplets must collide and coalesce 
to form precipitation-size particles. When droplets reach a threshold diameter of about 0.04  mm, they 
grow more rapidly by coalescence with other particles than by condensation of water vapor.
9.5.2 A IR MASSES
Distinct air masses are a major feature of the troposphere. These air masses are uniform and hori-
zontally homogeneous. Their temperature and water vapor content are particularly uniform. These 
characteristics are determined by the nature of the surface over which a large air mass forms. Polar 
c o n tin e n tal  air  m a s s e s  f o rm  o v e r  c o l d  l an d  r e g i o n s ;  p o l ar  m ari tim e  air  m a s s e s  f o rm  o v e r  p o l ar  
oceans. Air masses originating in the tropics may be similarly classifi  ed as tropical continental air 244 Environmental Chemistry
masses or tropical maritime air masses. The movement of air masses and the conditions in them 
may have important effects on pollutant reactions, effects, and dispersal.
Solar energy received by Earth is largely redistributed by the movement of huge masses of air with 
different pressures, temperatures, and moisture contents separated by boundaries called fronts . 
Horizontally moving air is called wind , whereas vertically moving air is referred to as an air current . 
Atmospheric air moves constantly, with behavior and effects that refl  ect the laws governing the behavior 
of gases. First of all, gases will move horizontally and/or vertically from regions of high atmospheric 
pressure  to those of low atmospheric pressure . Furthermore, expansion of gases causes cooling, whereas 
compression causes warming. A mass of warm air tends to move from the Earth’s surface to higher 
altitudes where the pressure is lower; in so doing, it expands adiabatically  (i.e., without exchanging 
energy with its surroundings) and becomes cooler. If there is no condensation of moisture from the air, 
the cooling effect is about 10 ∞C/1000  m of altitude, a fi  gure known as the dry adiabatic lapse rate . A 
cold mass of air at a higher altitude does the opposite; it sinks and becomes warmer at about 10 ∞C/1000  m. 
Often, however, when there is suffi  cient moisture in rising air, water condenses from it, releasing latent 
heat. This partially counteracts the cooling effect of the expanding air, giving a moist adiabatic lapse 
rate of about 6 ∞C/1000  m. Parcels of air do not rise and fall, or even move horizontally in a completely 
uniform way, but exhibit eddies, currents, and various degrees of turbulence.
As noted above, wind is air moving horizontally, whereas air currents  are created by air moving up 
or down. Wind occurs because of differences in air pressure from high-pressure regions to low-pressure 
areas. Air currents are largely convection currents  formed by differential heating of air masses. Air that 
is over a solar heated land mass is warmed, becomes less dense, and therefore rises and is replaced by 
cooler and more dense air. Wind and air currents are strongly involved with air pollution phenomena. 
Wind carries and disperses air pollutants. In some cases the absence of wind can enable pollutants to 
collect in a region and undergo processes that lead to even more (secondary) pollutants. Prevailing wind 
direction is an important factor in determining the areas most affected by an air pollution source. Wind 
is an important renewable energy resource (see Chapter 18). Furthermore, wind plays an important role 
in the propagation of life by dispersing spores, seeds, and organisms, such as spiders.
9.5.3 T OPOGRAPHICAL  EFFECTS
Topography , the surface confi  guration and relief features of the Earth’s surface may strongly affect 
winds and air currents. Differential heating and cooling of land surfaces and bodies of water can 
result in local convective winds , including land breezes and sea breezes at different times of the day 
along the seashore, as well as breezes associated with large bodies of water inland. Mountain topo-
graphy causes complex and variable localized winds. The masses of air in mountain valleys heat up 
during the day causing upslope winds, and cool off at night causing downslope winds. Upslope 
winds fl  ow over ridge tops in mountainous regions. The blocking of wind and of masses of air by 
mountain formations some distance inland from seashores can trap bodies of air, particularly when 
temperature inversion conditions occur (see Section 9.6). 
9.5.4 M OVEMENT  OF AIR MASSES
Basically, weather is the result of the interactive effects of (1) redistribution of solar energy, (2) hori-
zontal and vertical movement of air masses with varying moisture contents, and (3) evaporation and 
condensation of water, accompanied by uptake and release of heat. To see how these factors deter-
mine weather—and ultimately climate—on a global scale, fi  rst consider the cycle illustrated in 
Figure 9 .5. This fi  gure shows solar energy being absorbed by a body of water and causing some 
water to evaporate. The warm, moist mass of air thus produced moves from a region of high pres-
sure to one of low pressure, and cools by expansion as it rises in what is called a convection column . 
As the air cools, water condenses from it and energy is released; this is a major pathway by which 
energy is transferred from the Earth’s surface to high in the atmosphere. As a result of condensation The Atmosphere and Atmospheric Chemistry 245
of water and loss of energy, the air is converted from warm, moist air to cool, dry air. Furthermore, 
the movement of the parcel of air to high altitudes results in a degree of “crowding” of air molecules 
and creates a zone of relatively high pressure high in the troposphere at the top of the convection 
column. This air mass, in turn, moves from the upper-level region of high pressure to one of low 
pressure; in so doing, it subsides, thus creating an upper-level low-pressure zone, and becomes 
warm, dry air in the process. The pileup of this air at the surface creates a surface high-pressure 
zone where the cycle described above began. The warm, dry air in this surface high-pressure zone 
again picks up moisture, and the cycle begins again.
9.5.5 G LOBAL  WEATHER
The factors discussed above that determine and describe the movement of air masses are involved 
in the massive movement of air, moisture, and energy that occurs globally. The central feature of 
global weather is the redistribution of solar energy that falls unequally on Earth at different latitudes 
(relative distances from the equator and poles). Consider Figure 9.6. Sunlight, and the energy fl  ux 
from it, is most intense at the equator because, averaged over the seasons, solar radiation comes in 
perpendicular to the Earth’s surface at the equator. With increasing distance from the equator (higher 
latitudes) the angle is increasingly oblique and more of the energy-absorbing atmosphere must be 
traversed, so that progressively less energy is received per unit area of the Earth’ s surface. The net 
result is that equatorial regions receive a much greater share of solar radiation, progressively less is FIGURE 9.5 Circulation patterns involved with movement of air masses and water; uptake and release of

received farther from the equator, and the poles receive a comparatively miniscule amount. The 
excess heat energy in the equatorial regions causes the air to rise. The air ceases to rise when it 
reaches the stratosphere because in the stratosphere the air becomes warmer with higher elevation. 
As the hot equatorial air rises in the troposphere, it cools by expansion and loss of water, and then 
sinks again. The air circulation patterns in which this occurs are called Hadley cells . As shown in 
Figure 9.6, there are three major groupings of these cells, which result in very distinct climatic 
regions on the Earth’s surface. The air in the Hadley cells does not move straight north and south, but 
is defl  ected by the Earth’s rotation and by contact with the rotating Earth; this is the Coriolis effect , 
which results in spiral-shaped air circulation patterns called cyclonic or anticyclonic, depending on 
the direction of rotation. These give rise to different directions of prevailing winds, depending on 
latitude. The boundaries between the massive bodies of circulating air shift markedly over time and 
season, resulting in signifi  cant weather instability.
The movement of air in Hadley cells combined with other atmospheric phenomena results in the 
development of massive jet streams  that are, in a sense, shifting rivers of air that may be several kilo-
meters deep and several tens of kilometers wide. Jet streams move through discontinuities in the tropo-
pause (see Section 9.3), generally from west to east at velocities around 200  km/h (well over 100  mph); 
in so doing, they redistribute huge amounts of air and have a strong infl  uence on weather patterns.
The air and wind circulation patterns described above shift massive amounts of energy over long 
distances on Earth. If it were not for this effect, the equatorial regions would be unbearably hot, and 
the regions closer to the poles intolerably cold. About half of the heat that is redistributed is carried 
as sensible heat by air circulation, almost one-third is carried by water vapor as latent heat, and the 
remaining approximately 20% by ocean currents.
9.5.6 W EATHER  FRONTS  AND STORMS
As noted earlier, the interface between two masses of air that differ in temperature, density, and 
water content is called a front. A mass of cold air moving such that it displaces one of warm air is a FIGURE 9.6 Global circulation of air in the northern hemisphere.Equator 30˚N 60˚NNorth

cold front , and a mass of warm air displacing one of cold air is a warm front . Since cold air is more 
dense than warm air, the air in a cold mass of air along a cold front pushes under warmer air. This 
causes the warm, moist air to rise such that water condenses from it. The condensation of water 
releases energy, so the air rises further. The net effect can be the formation of massive cloud forma-
tions (thunderheads) that may reach stratospheric levels. These spectacular thunderheads may pro-
duce heavy rainfall and even hail, and sometimes violent storms with strong winds, including 
tornadoes. Warm fronts cause somewhat similar effects such as warm, moist air pushes over colder 
air. However, the front is usually much broader, and the weather effects milder, typically resulting 
in widespread drizzle rather than intense rainstorms.
Swirling cyclonic storms , such as typhoons, hurricanes, and tornadoes, are created in low- 
pressure areas by rising masses of warm, moist air. As such air cools, water vapor condenses, and 
the latent heat released warms the air more, sustaining and intensifying its movement upward in the 
atmosphere. Air rising from surface level creates a low-pressure zone into which surrounding air 
moves. The movement of the incoming air assumes a spiral pattern, thus causing a cyclonic storm. 
9.6 INVERSIONS AND AIR POLLUTION
The complicated movement of air across the Earth’s surface is a crucial factor in the creation and 
dispersal of air pollution phenomena. When air movement ceases, stagnation can occur with a 
 resultant buildup of atmospheric pollutants in localized regions. Although the temperature of air 
relatively near the Earth’s surface normally decreases with increasing altitude, certain atmospheric 
conditions can result in the opposite condition—increasing temperature with increasing altitude. 
Such conditions are characterized by high atmospheric stability and are known as temperature 
inversions . Because they limit the vertical circulation of air, temperature inversions result in air 
stagnation and the trapping of air pollutants in localized areas.
Inversions can occur in several ways. An inversion can form when a warm air mass overrides a 
cold air mass. Radiation inversions  are likely to form in still air at night when Earth is no longer 
receiving solar radiation. The air closest to Earth cools faster than the air higher in the atmosphere, 
which remains warm, thus less dense. Furthermore, cooler surface air tends to fl  ow into valleys at 
night, where it is overlain by warmer, less dense air. Subsidence inversions , often  widespread and 
accompanied by radiation inversions, can form in the vicinity of a surface high-pressure area when 
high-level air subsides to take the place of surface air blowing out of the high-pressure zone. The 
subsiding air is warmed as it compresses and can remain as a warm layer several hundred meters 
above ground level. A marine inversion  is produced during the summer months when cool air laden 
with moisture from the ocean blows onshore and under warm, dry inland air.
As noted above, inversions contribute signifi  cantly to the effects of air pollution because, as shown 
in Figure 9.7, they prevent mixing of air pollutants, thus keeping the pollutants in one area. This not 
only prevents the pollutants from escaping, but also acts like a container in which additional pollut-
ants accumulate. Furthermore, in the case of secondary pollutants formed by atmospheric chemical 
processes, such as photochemical smog (see Chapter 13), the pollutants may be kept together such 
that they react with each other and with sunlight to produce even more noxious products.
9.7 GLOBAL CLIMATE AND MICROCLIMATE
Perhaps the single most important infl  uence on the Earth’s environment is climate , consisting of 
long-term weather patterns over large geographical areas. As a general rule, climatic conditions are 
characteristic of a particular region. This does not mean that climate remains the same throughout 
the year, of course, because it varies with season. One important example of such variation is the 
monsoon , seasonal variations in wind patterns between oceans and continents accompanied by 
alternate periods of high and low rainfall. The climates of Africa and the Indian subcontinent are 
particularly infl  uenced by monsoons. Summer monsoon rains are responsible for tropical rain 248 Environmental Chemistry
 forests in Central Africa. The interface between this region and the Sahara Desert varies over time. 
When the boundary is relatively far north, rain falls on the Sahel desert region at the interface, crops 
grow, and the people do relatively well. When the boundary is more to the south, a condition that 
may last for several years, devastating droughts and even starvation may occur.
It is known that there are fl  uctuations, cycles, and cycles imposed on cycles in climate. The 
causes of these variations are not completely understood, but they are known to be substantial, and 
even devastating to civilization. The last ice age , which ended only about 10,000 years ago and 
which was preceded by several similar ice ages, produced conditions under which much of the 
present land mass of the northern hemisphere was buried under thick layers of ice and were unin-
habitable. A “mini-ice age” occurred during the 1300s, causing crop failures and severe hardship in 
northern Europe. In modern times the El-Niño-Southern oscillation occurs with a period of several 
years when a large, semipermanent tropical low-pressure area shifts into the Central Pacifi  c region 
from its more common location in the vicinity of Indonesia. This shift modifi  es prevailing winds, 
changes the pattern of ocean currents, and affects upwelling of ocean nutrients with profound effects 
on weather, rainfall, and fi  sh and bird life over a vast area of the Pacifi  c from Australia to the west 
coasts of South and North America.
9.7.1  ATMOSPHERIC  CARBON  DIOXIDE  AND HUMAN  MODIFICATIONS  OF CLIMATE
Although the Earth’s atmosphere is huge and has an enormous ability to resist and correct for 
detrimental change, it is likely that human activities are reaching a point at which they are signifi  -
cantly affecting climate. One such way is by emission of large quantities of carbon dioxide and other 
 greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, with the potential to cause global warming and substan-
tial climatic change. It is known that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are increasing by about 
2 ppm volume per year and are on track to more than double from preindustrial levels during the 
current century. Furthermore, global temperatures during recent decades have increased measurably, 
consistent with models of global warming from atmospheric greenhouse gases. The infl  uence of 
atmospheric carbon dioxide on global temperatures and possible impacts on climate are  discussed 
in more detail in Section 14.2.
9.7.2  MICROCLIMATE
The preceding section described climate on a large scale, ranging up to global dimensions. The 
climate that organisms and objects on the surface are exposed to close to the ground, under rocks, FIGURE 9.7 Illustration of pollutants trapped in a temperature inversion.Confining topography Warmer

and surrounded by vegetation is often quite different from the surrounding macroclimate. Such 
highly localized climatic conditions are termed the microclimate . Microclimate effects are largely 
determined by the uptake and loss of solar energy very close to the Earth’s surface, and by the fact 
that air circulation due to wind is much lower at the surface. During the day, solar energy absorbed 
by relatively bare soil heats the surface, but is lost only slowly because of very limited air circulation 
at the surface. This provides a warm blanket of surface air several centimeters thick, and an even 
thinner layer of warm soil. At night, radiative loss of heat from the surface of soil and vegetation can 
result in surface temperatures several degrees colder than the air about 2  m above ground level. 
These lower temperatures result in condensation of dew on v egetation and the soil surface, thus 
providing a relatively more moist microclimate near ground level. Heat absorbed during early mor-
ning evaporation of the dew tends to prolong the period of cold experienced right at the surface.
Vegetation substantially affects microclimate. In relatively dense growths, circulation may be 
virtually zero at the surface because vegetation severely limits convection and diffusion. The crown 
surface of the vegetation intercepts most of the solar energy, so that maximum solar heating may be 
a signifi  cant distance up from the Earth’s surface. The region below the crown surface of vegetation 
thus becomes one of relatively stable temperature. In addition, in a dense growth of vegetation, most 
of the moisture loss is not from evaporation from the soil surface, but rather from transpiration from 
plant leaves. The net result is the creation of temperature and humidity conditions that provide a 
favorable living environment for a number of organisms, such as insects and rodents.
Another factor infl  uencing microclimate is the degree to which the slope of land faces north or 
s o u t h .  S o u t h - f a c i n g  s l o p e s  o f  l a n d  i n  t h e  n o r t h e r n  h e m i s p h e r e  r e c e i v e  g r e a t e r  s o l a r  e n e r g y .  
Advantage has been taken of this phenomenon in restoring land strip-mined for brown coal in 
Germany by terracing the land such that the terraces have broad south slopes and very narrow 
north slopes. On the south-sloping portions of the terrace, the net effect has been to extend the 
short summer growing season by several days, thereby signifi  cantly increasing crop productivity. 
In areas where the growing season is longer, better growing conditions may exist on a north slope 
because it is less subject to temperature extremes and to loss of water by evaporation and 
transpiration.
9.7.3  EFFECTS  OF URBANIZATION  ON MICROCLIMATE
A particularly marked effect on microclimate is that induced by urbanization. In a rural setting, 
vegetation and bodies of water have a moderating effect, absorbing modest amounts of solar energy 
and releasing it slowly. The stone, concrete, and asphalt pavement of cities have an opposite 
effect, strongly absorbing solar energy, and reradiating heat back to the urban microclimate. Rainfall 
is not allowed to accumulate in ponds, but is drained away as rapidly and effi  ciently as possible. 
Human activities generate signifi  cant amounts of heat, and produce large quantities of CO2 and 
other greenhouse gases that retain heat. The net result of these effects is that a city is capped by a 
heat dome  in which the temperature is as much as 5 ∞C warmer than in the surrounding rural areas, 
such that large cities have been described as “heat islands.” The rising warmer air over a city brings 
in a breeze from the surrounding area and causes a local greenhouse effect that probably is largely 
counter balanced by refl  ection of incoming solar energy by particulate matter above cities. Overall, 
compared to climatic conditions in nearby rural surroundings, the city microclimate is warmer, 
foggier, and overlain with more cloud cover a greater percentage of the time, and is subject to more 
precipitation, though generally less humid. 
9.8 CHEMICAL AND PHOTOCHEMICAL REACTIONS IN THE ATMOSPHERE
Figure 9.8 represents some of the major atmospheric chemical processes, which are discussed under 
the topic of atmospheric chemistry . Several key concepts of atmospheric chemistry that are impor-
tant for this discussion were defi  ned at the beginning of the chapter. These include the energy of a 250 Environmental Chemistry
photon, hn, the excited state, often designated with an asterisk, *, free radicals such as the hydroxyl 
radical, HO∑, and energy absorbing third bodies denoted M.
The atmosphere is a huge, variable “laboratory” in which the study of chemical processes is very 
challenging. One of the primary obstacles encountered in studying atmospheric chemistry is that 
the chemist generally must deal with incredibly low concentrations, so that the detection and analy-
sis of reaction products is quite diffi  cult (see Chapter 26). Simulating high-altitude conditions in the 
laboratory can be extremely hard because of interferences, such as those from species given off 
from container walls under conditions of very low pressure. Many chemical reactions that require a 
third body to absorb excess energy occur very slowly in the upper atmosphere where there is a 
sparse concentration of third bodies, but occur readily in a container whose walls effectively absorb 
energy. Container walls may serve as catalysts for some important reactions, or they may absorb 
important species and react chemically with the more reactive ones.
Atmospheric chemistry involves the unpolluted atmosphere, highly polluted atmospheres, and a 
wide range of gradations in between. The same general phenomena govern all and produce one huge 
atmospheric cycle in which there are numerous subcycles. Gaseous atmospheric chemical species 
fall into the following somewhat arbitrary and overlapping classifi  cations: inorganic oxides (CO, 
CO2, NO2, SO2), oxidants  (O3, H2O2, HO∑ radical, HO2∑ radical, ROO∑ radicals, NO3), reductants  
(CO, SO2, H2S), organics  (also reductants; in the unpolluted atmosphere, CH4 is the predominant 
organic species, whereas alkanes, alkenes, and aryl compounds are common around sources of 
organic pollution), oxidized organic species  (carbonyls, organic nitrates), photochemically active 
species  (NO2, formaldehyde), acids (H2SO4), bases (NH3), salts (NH4HSO4), and unstable reactive 
species  (electronically excited NO2*, HO∑ radical). In addition, both solid and liquid particles in 
atmospheric aerosols and clouds play a strong role in atmospheric chemistry as sources and sinks 
for gas-phase species, as sites for surface reactions (solid particles) and as bodies for aqueous-phase 
reactions (liquid droplets). Two constituents of utmost importance in atmospheric chemistry are 
radiant energy from the sun, predominantly in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum, and the 
hydroxyl radical, HO∑. The former provides a way to pump a high level of energy into a single gas 
molecule to start a series of atmospheric chemical reactions, and the latter is the most important 
reactive intermediate and “currency” of daytime atmospheric chemical phenomena; NO3 radicals 
are important intermediates in nightime atmospheric chemistry. These are addressed in more detail 
in this chapter and Chapters 10 through 14.FIGURE 9.8 Representation of major atmospheric chemical processes.Absorption of solar

Of particular importance in atmospheric chemistry is the discipline of chemical kinetics , which 
deals with rates of reactions. A detailed discussion of the kinetics of atmospheric chemical pro-
cesses is beyond the scope of this book and the reader is referred to other sources, such as those 
listed in the supplementary references at the end of this chapter.
The rate constants, which describe chemical reaction rates, vary widely and are important tools 
for the atmospheric chemist to describe and explain atmospheric chemical processes. Uncertainties 
still exist regarding the values of particular rate constants.
9.8.1 P HOTOCHEMICAL  PROCESSES
The absorption by chemical species of light, broadly defi  ned here to include ultraviolet radiation 
from the sun, can bring about reactions, called photochemical reactions , which do not otherwise 
occur under the conditions (particularly the temperature) of the medium in the absence of light. 
Thus, photochemical reactions, even in the absence of a chemical catalyst, occur at temperatures 
much lower than those which otherwise would be required. Photochemical reactions, which are 
induced by intense solar radiation, play a very important role in determining the nature and ultimate 
fate of a chemical species in the atmosphere.
Nitrogen dioxide, NO2, is one of the most photochemically active species found in a polluted 
atmosphere and is an essential participant in the smog-formation process. A species such as NO2 
may absorb light of energy hn, producing an electronically excited molecule , 
 NO2 + hn Æ NO2* (9.7)
designated in the reaction above by an asterisk, *. The photochemistry of nitrogen dioxide is dis-
cussed in greater detail in Chapters 11 and 13.
Electronically excited molecules compose one of the three kinds of relatively reactive and unsta-
ble species that are encountered in the atmosphere and are strongly involved with atmospheric chemi-
cal processes. The other two species are atoms or molecular fragments with unshared electrons, 
called free radicals , and ions consisting of electrically charged atoms or molecular fragments.
Electronically excited molecules are produced when stable molecules absorb energetic electromag-
netic radiation in the ultraviolet or visible regions of the spectrum. A molecule may possess several 
possible excited states, but generally ultraviolet or visible radiation is energetic enough to excite mol-
ecules only to several of the lowest energy levels. The nature of the excited state may be understood by 
considering the disposition of electrons in a molecule. Most molecules have an even number of elec-
trons. The electrons occupy orbitals, with a maximum of two electrons with opposite spin occupying 
the same orbital. The absorption of light may promote one of these electrons to a vacant orbital of 
higher energy. In some cases the electron thus promoted retains a spin opposite to that of its former 
partner , gi vin g rise to an excited singlet state . In other cases the spin of the promoted electron is 
reversed, such that it has the same spin as its former partner; this gives rise to an excited triplet state .

The chemical species in excited states are relatively energized compared to the ground state and 
are chemically reactive species. Their participation in atmospheric chemical reactions, such as those 
involved in smog formation, will be discussed later in detail.
In order for a photochemical reaction to occur, light must be absorbed by the reacting species. If 
the absorbed light is in the visible region of the sun’s spectrum, the absorbing species is colored. 
Colored NO2 is a common example of such a species in the atmosphere. Normally, the fi  rst step in 
a photochemical process is the activation of the molecule by the absorption of a single unit of 
 photochemical energy characteristic of the frequency of the light called a quantum  of light. The 
energy of one quantum is equal to the product hn, where h is Planc k’ s constan t, 6. 6 3  ¥ 10-34 J s 
(6.63  ¥ 10-27 erg s), and n is the frequency of the absorbed light in s-1 (inversely proportional to its 
wavelength, l).
The reactions that occur following absorption of a photon of light to produce an electronically 
excited species are largely determined by the way in which the excited species loses its excess 
energy. This may occur by one of the following processes.
L o s s  o f  e n e r g y  t o  a n o t h e r  m o l e c u l e  o r  a t o m  ( M )  b y  • physical quenching , followed by

to occur when the excited species (such as NO2* below) is formed by a chemical process:

Electromagnetic radiation absorbed in the infrared region lacks the energy to break chemical 
bonds, but does cause the receptor molecules to gain vibrational and rotational energy. The energy 
absorbed as infrared radiation ultimately is dissipated as heat and raises the temperature of the 
whole atmosphere. As noted in Section 9.3, the absorption of infrared radiation is very important in 
the Earth’s acquiring heat from the sun and in the retention of energy radiated from the Earth’s 
surface.
9.8.2 I ONS AND RADICALS  IN THE ATMOSPHERE
One of the characteristics of the upper atmosphere which is diffi  cult to duplicate under laboratory 
conditions is the presence of signifi  cant levels of electrons and positive ions. Because of the rarefi  ed 
conditions, these ions may exist in the upper atmosphere for long periods before recombining to 
form neutral species.
At altitudes of approximately 50  km and up, ions are so prevalent that the region is called the 
ionosphere . The presence of the ionosphere has been known since about 1901, when it was discov-
ered that radio waves could be transmitted over long distances where the curvature of Earth makes 
line-of-sight transmission impossible. These radio waves bounce off the ionosphere.
Ultraviolet light is the primary producer of ions in the ionosphere. In darkness, the positive 
ions slowly recombine with free electrons. The process is more rapid in the lower regions of the 
ionosphere where the concentration of species is relatively high. Thus, the lower limit of the iono-
sphere lifts at night and makes possible the transmission of radio waves over much greater 
distances.
The Earth’s magnetic fi  eld has a strong infl  uence on the ions in the upper atmosphere. Probably 
the best-known manifestation of this phenomenon is found in the Van Allen belts, discovered in 
1958 consisting of two belts of ionized particles encircling the Earth. They can be visualized as two 
doughnuts with the axis of the Earth’s magnetic fi  eld extending through the holes in the doughnuts. 
The inner belt consists of protons and the outer belt consists of electrons. A schematic diagram of 
the Van Allen belts is shown in Figure 9.9.
Although ions are produced in the upper atmosphere primarily by the action of energetic electro-
magnetic radiation, they may also be produced in the troposphere by the shearing of water droplets 
FIGURE 9.9 Cross section of the Van Allen belts encircling Earth.Axis of

during precipitation. The shearing may be caused by the compression of descending masses of cold 
air or by strong winds over hot, dry land masses. The last phenomenon is known as the foehn, 
sharav (in the Near East), or Santa Ana (in southern California). These hot, dry winds cause severe 
discomfort. The ions they produce consist of electrons and positively charged molecular species.
9.8.2.1 Free Radicals
In addition to forming ions by photoionization, energetic electromagnetic radiation in the atmosphere 
may produce atoms or groups of atoms with unpaired electrons called free radicals :
 H3CCHO
H3C•• CHO
+  hn +  (9.16)
Free radicals are in v olv ed with most signifi  cant atmospheric chemical phenomena and are of 
utmost importance in the atmosphere. Because of their unpaired electrons and the strong pairing 
tendencies of electrons under most circumstances, free radicals are highly reactive. The upper atmo-
sphere is so rarefi  ed, ho w ev er , that at v ery high altitudes radicals may ha v e half -liv es of sev eral 
minutes, or even longer. Radicals can take part in chain reactions in which one of the products of 
each reaction is a radical. Eventually, through processes such as reaction with another radical, one 
of the radicals in a chain is destroyed and the chain ends:
 H3C∑ + H3C∑ Æ C2H6 (9.17)
This process is a chain-terminating reaction . Reactions involving free radicals are responsible for 
smog formation, discussed in Chapter 13.
Free radicals are quite reactive; therefore, they generally have short lifetimes. It is important to 
distinguish between high reactivity and instability. A totally isolated free radical or atom would be 
quite stable. Therefore, free radicals and single atoms from diatomic gases tend to persist under the 
rarefi ed conditions of very high altitudes because they can travel long distances before colliding 
with another reactive species. However, electronically excited species have a fi  nite, generally very 
short lifetime because they can lose energy through radiation without having to react with another 
species.
9.8.3 H YDROXYL  AND HYDROPEROXYL  RADICALS  IN THE ATMOSPHERE
As illustrated in Figure 9.10, the hydroxyl radical, HO∑, is the single most important reactive inter-
mediate species in atmospheric chemical processes. It is formed by several mechanisms. At higher 
altitudes it is produced by photolysis of water:
 H2O + hn Æ HO∑ + H  (9.18)
In the presence of organic matter, hydroxyl radical is produced in abundant quantities as an inter-
mediate in the formation of photochemical smog (see Chapter 13). To a certain extent in the atmo-
sphere, and for laboratory experimentation, HO∑ is made by the photolysis of nitrous acid vapor:
 HONO + hn Æ HO∑ + NO  (9.19)
Hydroxyl radical is also generated by photodissociation of hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, the most 
important oxidant in solution in atmospheric particles of fog, cloud, or rain:
 H2O2 + hn Æ HO∑ + HO∑  (9.20)The Atmosphere and Atmospheric Chemistry 255
In the relatively unpolluted troposphere, hydroxyl radical is produced as a result of photolysis of ozone:
 O3 + hn(l <315 nm) Æ O* + O2 (9.21)
followed by the reaction of a fraction of the excited oxygen atoms with water molecules:
 O* + H2O Æ 2HO∑  (9.22)
Involvement of the hydroxyl radical in chemical transformations of a number of trace species in 
the atmosphere is summarized in Figure 9.10, and some of the pathways illustrated are discussed in 
later chapters. Among the important atmospheric trace species that react with hydroxyl radical are 
carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfi  de, methane, and nitric oxide.FIGURE 9.10 Control of trace gas concentrations by HO∑ radical in the troposphere. Processes below the 
dashed line are those largely involved in controlling the concentrations of HO∑ in the troposphere; those above 
the line control the concentrations of the associated reactants and products. Reservoirs of atmospheric species 
are shown in circles, reactions denoting conversion of one species to another are shown by arrows, and the reac-
tants or photons needed to bring about a particular conversion are shown along the arrows. Hydrogen halides 
are denoted by HX and hydrocarbons by H xYy. (Reprinted from D.D. Davis and W.L. Chameides, Chemistry

Hydroxyl radical is most frequently removed from the troposphere by reaction with methane or 
carbon monoxide:
 CH4 + HO∑ Æ H3C∑ + H2O (9.23)
 CO + HO∑ Æ CO2 + H (9.24)
The highly reactive methyl radical, H3C∑, reacts with O2,
 H3C∑ + O2 Æ H3COO∑ (9.25)
to form methylperoxyl radical , H3COO∑. (Further reactions of this species are discussed in Chapter 13.) 
The hydrogen atom produced in Reaction 9.24 reacts with O2 to produce hydroperoxyl radical :
 H + O2 Æ HOO∑ (9.26)
The hydroperoxyl radical can undergo chain termination reactions, such as
 HOO∑ + HO∑ Æ H2O + O2  (9.27)
 HOO∑ + HOO∑ Æ H2O2 + O2  (9.28)
or reactions that regenerate hydroxyl radical:
 HOO∑ + NO Æ NO2 + HO∑  (9.29)
 HOO∑ + O3 Æ 2O2 + HO∑  (9.30)
The global concentration of hydroxyl radical, averaged diurnally and seasonally, is estimated to 
range from 2  ¥ 105 to 1 ¥ 106 radicals per cm3 in the troposphere. Because of the higher humidity 
and higher incident sunlight which result in elevated O* levels, the concentration of HO∑ is higher 
in tropical regions. The southern hemisphere probably has about a 20% higher level of HO∑ than 
does the northern hemisphere because of greater production of anthropogenic, HO∑-consuming CO 
in the northern hemisphere.
The hydroperoxyl radical, HOO∑, is an intermediate in some important chemical reactions. In 
addition to its production by the reactions discussed above, in polluted atmospheres, hydroperoxyl 
radical is made by the following two reactions, starting with photolytic dissociation of formalde-
hyde to produce a reactive formyl radical:
 ∑
+n Æ + HCHO H HCO h (9.31)
 ∑
∑+Æ +2 HCO O HOO CO (9.32)
The hydroperoxyl radical reacts more slowly with other species than does the hydroxyl radical. The 
kinetics and mechanisms of hydroperoxyl radical reactions are diffi  cult to study because it is hard 
to retain these radicals free of hydroxyl radicals.
9.8.4  CHEMICAL  AND BIOCHEMICAL  PROCESSES  IN EVOLUTION  OF THE ATMOSPHERE
It is now widely believed that the Earth’s atmosphere originally was very different from its present 
state and that the changes were brought about by biological activity and accompanying chemical The Atmosphere and Atmospheric Chemistry 257
changes. Approximately 3.5 billion years ago, when the fi  rst primitive life molecules were formed, 
the atmosphere was probably free of oxygen and consisted of a variety of gases such as carbon 
dioxide, water vapor, and perhaps even methane, ammonia, and hydrogen. The atmosphere was 
bombarded by intense, bond-breaking ultraviolet light which, along with lightning and radiation 
from radionuclides, provided the energy to bring about chemical reactions that resulted in the 
production of relatively complicated molecules, including even amino acids and sugars. From 
the rich chemical mixture in the sea, life molecules evolved. Initially, these very primitive life 
forms derived their energy from fermentation of organic matter formed by chemical and photo-
chemical processes, but eventually they gained the capability to produce organic matter, “{CH2O},” 
by photosynthesis:
 CO2 + H2O + hn Æ {CH2O} + O2(g) (9.33)
Photosynthesis released oxygen, thereby setting the stage for the massive biochemical transforma-
tion that resulted in the production of almost all the atmosphere’s O2.
The oxygen initially produced by photosynthesis was probably quite toxic to primitive life forms. 
However, much of this oxygen was converted to iron oxides by reaction with soluble iron(II):
 4Fe2+ + O2 + 4H2O Æ 2Fe2O3 + 8H+ (9.34)
This resulted in the formation of enormous deposits of iron oxides, the existence of which provides 
major evidence for the liberation of free oxygen in the primitive atmosphere.
Eventually, enzyme systems developed that enabled organisms to mediate the reaction of waste-
product oxygen with oxidizable organic matter in the sea. Later, this mode of waste-product dis-
posal was utilized by organisms to produce energy by respiration, which is now the mechanism by 
which nonphotosynthetic organisms obtain energy.
In time, O2 accumulated in the atmosphere, providing an abundant source of oxygen for respira-
tion. It had an additional benefi  t in that it enabled the formation of an ozone shield (see Section 9.9). 
The ozone shield absorbs bond-rupturing ultraviolet light. With the ozone shield protecting tissue 
from destruction by high-energy ultraviolet radiation, Earth became a much more hospitable envi-
ronment for life, and life forms were enabled to move from the sea to land.
9.9 ACID–BASE REACTIONS IN THE ATMOSPHERE
Acid–base reactions occur between acidic and basic species in the atmosphere. The atmosphere is 
normally at least slightly acidic because of the presence of a low level of carbon dioxide, which dis-
solves in atmospheric water droplets and dissociates slightly:
 æææ Æ22WaterCO ( ) CO ( ) ga q (9.35)
 CO2(aq) + H2O Æ H+ + HCO3- (9.36)
Atmospheric sulfur dioxide forms a somewhat stronger acid than carbon dioxide when it dissolves 
in water:
 SO2(g) + H2O Æ H+ + HSO3- (9.37)
In terms of pollution, however, strongly acidic HNO3 and H2SO4 formed by the atmospheric oxidation 
of N oxides, SO2, and H2S are much more important because they lead to the formation of damaging 
acid rain (see Chapter 14).258 Environmental Chemistry
As refl  ected by the generally acidic pH of rainwater, basic species are relatively less common in 
the atmosphere. Particulate calcium oxide, hydroxide, and carbonate can get into the atmosphere 
from ash and ground rock, and can react with acids such as in the following reaction:
 Ca(OH)2(s) + H2SO4(aq) Æ CaSO4(s) + 2H2O (9.38)
The most important basic species in the atmosphere is gas-phase ammonia, NH3. The major source 
of atmospheric ammonia is from biodegradation of nitrogen-containing biological matter and from 
bacterial reduction of nitrate:
 NO3-(aq) + 2{CH2O}(biomass) + H+ Æ NH3(g) + 2CO2 + H2O (9.39)
Ammonia is particularly important as a base in the air because it is the only water-soluble base 
present at signifi  cant levels in the atmosphere. Dissolved in atmospheric water droplets, it plays a 
strong role in neutralizing atmospheric acids:
 NH3(aq) + HNO3(aq) Æ NH4NO3(aq) (9.40) 
 NH3(aq) + H2SO4(aq) Æ NH4HSO4(aq) (9.41)
These reactions have three effects: (1) they result in the presence of NH4+ ion in the atmosphere as 
dissolved or solid salts, (2) they serve in part to neutralize acidic constituents of the atmosphere, and 
(3) they produce relatively corrosive ammonium salts.
9.10 REACTIONS OF ATMOSPHERIC OXYGEN
Some of the primary features of the exchange of oxygen among the atmosphere, geosphere, hydro-
sphere, biosphere, and anthrosphere are summarized in Figure 9.11. The oxygen cycle is critically 
important in atmospheric chemistry, geochemical transformations, and life processes.
Oxygen in the troposphere plays a strong role in processes that occur on the Earth’s surface. 
Atmospheric oxygen takes part in energy-producing reactions, such as the burning of fossil fuels:
 CH4 (in natural gas) + 2O2 Æ CO2 + 2H2O (9.42)
Atmospheric oxygen is utilized by aerobic organisms in the degradation of organic material. Some 
oxidative weathering processes of minerals (see Section 15.2) consume oxygen, such as 
 4FeO + O2 Æ 2Fe2O3 (9.43)
Oxygen is returned to the atmosphere through plant photosynthesis:
 CO2 + H2O + hn Æ {CH2O} + O2 (9.44)
All molecular oxygen now in the atmosphere is thought to have originated through the action of 
photosynthetic organisms, which shows the importance of photosynthesis in the oxygen balance of 
the atmosphere. It can be shown that most of the carbon fi  xed by these photosynthetic processes is 
dispersed in mineral formations as humic material (Section 3.17); only a very small fraction is 
deposited in fossil fuel beds. Therefore, although combustion of fossil fuels consumes large amounts 
of O2, there is no danger of running out of atmospheric oxygen.The Atmosphere and Atmospheric Chemistry 259
9.11 REACTIONS OF ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN
The 78% by volume of nitrogen contained in the atmosphere constitutes an inexhaustible reservoir 
of that essential element. The nitrogen cycle and nitrogen fi  xation by microorganisms were dis-
cussed in Chapter 6. A small amount of nitrogen is fi  xed in the atmosphere by lightning, and some 
is also fi  xed by combustion processes, particularly in internal combustion and turbine engines.
Unlike oxygen, which is almost completely dissociated to the monatomic form in higher regions 
of the thermosphere, molecular nitrogen is not readily dissociated by ultraviolet radiation. However, 
at altitudes exceeding approximately 100  km, atomic nitrogen is produced by photochemical 
reactions:
 N2 + hn Æ N + N  (9.45)
Several reactions of ionic species in the ionosphere may generate N atoms as well.
The N2+ ion is generated by photoionization in the atmosphere:
 N2 + hn Æ N2+ + e-  (9.46)
and may react to form other ions. The NO+ ion is one of the predominant ionic species in the 
 so-called E region of the ionosphere.
Pollutant oxides of nitrogen, particularly NO2, are key species involved in air pollution and the 
formation of photochemical smog. For example, NO2 is readily dissociated photochemically to NO 
and reactive atomic oxygen:

The roles played by nitrogen oxides in smog formation and other forms of air pollution are discussed 
in Chapters 11 through 14.
9.12 ATMOSPHERIC WATER
The water vapor content of the troposphere is normally within a range of 1–3% by volume with a 
global average of about 1%. However, air can contain as little as 0.1% or as much as 5% water. The 
percentage of water in the atmosphere decreases rapidly with increasing altitude. Water circulates 
through the atmosphere in the hydrologic cycle as shown in Figure 3.1.
Water vapor absorbs infrared radiation even more strongly than does carbon dioxide, thus 
greatly infl  uencing the Earth’s heat balance. Clouds formed from water vapor refl  ect light from the 
sun and have a temperature-lowering effect. On the other hand, water vapor in the atmosphere acts 
as a kind of “blanket” at night, retaining heat from the Earth’s surface by absorption of infrared 
radiation.
As discussed in Section 9.5, water vapor and the heat released and absorbed by transitions of 
water between the vapor state and liquid or solid are strongly involved in atmospheric energy trans-
fer. Condensed water vapor in the form of very small droplets is of considerable concern in atmo-
spheric chemistry. The harmful effects of some air pollutants—for instance, the corrosion of metals 
by acid-forming gases—requires the presence of water which may come from the atmosphere. 
Atmospheric water vapor has an important infl  uence on pollution-induced fog formation under 
some circumstances. Water vapor interacting with pollutant particulate matter in the atmosphere 
may reduce visibility to undesirable levels through the formation of very small atmospheric aerosol 
particles.
As noted in Section 9.2, the cold tropopause serves as a barrier to the movement of water into the 
stratosphere. Thus, little water is transferred from the troposphere to the stratosphere, and the main 
source of water in the stratosphere is the photochemical oxidation of methane:
 + + n æææææ æ Æ+42 22 several  stepsCH 2O CO 2H O h  (9.48)
The water produced by this reaction serves as a source of stratospheric hydroxyl radical as shown 
by the following reaction:
 H2O + hn Æ HO∑ + H (9.49)
9.13 INFLUENCE OF THE ANTHROSPHERE
Human activities have had an enormous infl  uence on the atmosphere and atmospheric chemistry. 
Agricultural, industrial, and transportation activities have substantially altered the composition 
of trace gases in the atmosphere. These effects are particularly pronounced in the area of green-
house gases (carbon dioxide and methane in particular) that may lead to global warming and in 
alteration of levels of ozone in both the troposphere and stratosphere. Emissions of NO from 
industrial and transportation sources, and perhaps most importantly from biomass burning, have 
led to signifi  cant increases in tropospheric ozone in mid- and low latitudes, where it is an undesir-
able air pollutant. Emissions of CFCs (freons) have caused decreases of ozone in the stratosphere, 
particularly in the Antarctic, where it serves a vital protective function against ultraviolet 
radiation.
Although the atmosphere has a substantial ability to cleanse itself of harmful pollutants by oxi-
dizing them, this ability is being overtaxed in important respects. Of particular concern for the 
future are growing emissions from sources in developing countries.The Atmosphere and Atmospheric Chemistry 261
9.14 CHEMICAL FATE AND TRANSPORT IN THE ATMOSPHERE
The atmosphere is very much involved in fate and transport processes of environmental chemicals. To 
understand these processes, it is necessary to consider sources, transport, dispersal, and fl  uxes of air-
borne contaminants. Interactions at the atmosphere/surface boundary are important, including fl  ow and 
dispersal of material in the atmosphere over complex terrain, and around surface obstacles, such as trees 
and buildings. Interactions and interchange with surface media including rock and soil, water, and veg-
etation must be considered. Transport and dispersal by advection due to movement of masses of air and 
diffusive and Fickian transport (Section 1.8) are important considerations as are dispersion, and degra-
dation half-life.1,2 Pollutants in the atmosphere may be viewed on local, long-range, and global scales.
Local-scale chemical fate and transport may be viewed with respect to a smokestack point source. 
As Figure 9.12 illustrates, gases and particles are emitted from a stack and carried and dispersed by 
wind and air currents while undergoing mixing and dilution. Because stack gases are carried upward 
by a rising current warmer than the surrounding atmosphere, the effective height of a stack is always 
greater than its actual height. The farther from the stack source before pollutants reach ground level, 
the more dilute they are. The dispersion of pollutants is strongly infl  uenced by atmospheric condi-
tions such as wind, air turbulence, and the occurrence of temperature inversions (Figure 9.7). High 
stacks reduce the immediate impact of air pollutants and illustrate the once-prevailing philosophy 
that “The solution to pollution is dilution.”
Long-range transport of species in the atmosphere is an important aspect of air pollution. One 
illustration of long-range transport of air pollutants was the contamination of much of Europe includ-
ing northern reaches of Scandinavia by radionuclides emitted in the Chernobyl nuclear reactor melt-
down and fi  re. New England and southeastern Canada are affected by acid rainfall originating from 
sulfur dioxide emitted by power plants in the U.S. Ohio River Valley hundreds of kilometers distant.
Modeling long-range environmental fate and transport is an important exercise in determining 
sources of pollutants and mitigating their effects. Such models using sophisticated computer pro-
grams and high computing capacity must consider advective transport and mixing phenomena. 
Very large areas must be considered and averages taken over long time intervals. Weather condi-
tions are important factors.
Some important atmospheric pollutants must be considered on a global scale. Such pollutants have 
v ery long lif etimes so that they persist long enough to mix with and spread throughout the global 
atmosphere and they are produced from a variety of widely dispersed sources. An example of such a 
substance is greenhouse gas carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere by billions of heating and cook-
ing stoves, millions of automobiles, and thousands of power plants throughout the globe.
The Earth’s atmosphere cannot be considered as a single large mixing bowl for contaminants on 
a global scale. Prevailing winds cause relatively rapid mixing within the northern and southern 
FIGURE 9.12  Illustration of localized chemical fate and transport with air pollutants from a point source 
(smokestack).

hemisphere, whereas transport of atmospheric constituents across the equator is relatively slow. 
This phenomenon is illustrated by the discussion in Section 14.2 of atmospheric greenhouse gas 
carbon dioxide. In the northern hemisphere, which has an abundance of photosynthesizing plants, 
there is a pronounced annual fl  uctuation of several ppm in the levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide 
produced by the annual seasonal cycle of photosynthesis, whereas the fl  uctuation is much less pro-
nounced in the southern hemisphere, which has much less photosynthetic activity. Mixing between 
the two hemispheres over a year’s period of time is insuffi  cient to dampen the fl  uctuation, whereas 
the average concentration of carbon dioxide is essentially the same in both hemispheres refl  ecting 
mixing over several years’ periods of time.
An interesting aspect of fate and transport involving the atmosphere is provided by the accumu-
l a ti o n  o f  s e mi v o l a til e  PO P  in  p o l ar  r e gi o n s .  Thi s  p h e n o m e n o n  o c c ur s  b y  a  di s till a ti o n  e ff ec t  in  
which such pollutants are evaporated in warmer latitudes, carried by air currents toward the poles, 
and condensed in colder polar regions. As a result, surprisingly high levels of some semivolatile 
POP (e.g., PCBs in Arctic polar bear fat) have been found in samples from polar regions.
Environmental fate and transport involving the atmosphere are obviously important in environ-
mental chemistry and a detailed discussion of this area is beyond the scope of this book. For addi-
tional material regarding this topic the reader is referred to reference works on the subject.4–6

10.1 INTRODUCTION
Particles abound in the atmosphere, ranging in size from about 1.5 mm (the size of sand or drizzle) 
down to molecular dimensions. Atmospheric particles are made up of an amazing variety of materi-
als and discrete objects that may consist of either solids or liquid droplets. A number of terms are 
commonly used to describe atmospheric particles; the more important of these are summarized in 
Table 10.1. Particulates  is a term that has come to stand for particles in the atmosphere, although 
particulate matter  or simply particles  is preferred usage.
Particulate matter makes up the most visible and obvious form of air pollution. Atmospheric 
aerosols  are solid or liquid particles smaller than 100 mm in diameter. Pollutant particles in the 
0.001–10 mm range are commonly suspended in the air near sources of pollution such as the urban 
atmosphere, industrial plants, highways, and power plants.
Very small, solid particles include carbon black, silver iodide, combustion nuclei, and sea-salt nuclei 
(Figure 10.1). Larger particles include cement dust, wind-blown soil dust, foundry dust, and pulverized 
coal. Liquid particulate matter, mist, includes raindrops, fog, and sulfuric acid mist. Particulate matter 
may be organic or inorganic; both types are very important atmospheric contaminants.
There are several major sources of particulate matter in the industrialized urban atmosphere. 
These include particles from coal combustion, secondary sulfate, secondary nitrate associated with 
upwind and local sources of NOx and NH3, secondary organic aerosols produced by chemical pro-
cesses operating on organic pollutants from a number of sources, and direct emissions from motor 
vehicle traffi  c, such as particles from diesel engine exhausts.
Some particles are of biological origin, such as viruses, bacteria, bacterial spores, fungal spores, 
and pollen. In addition to organic materials, organisms may contribute to sulfate particulate matter 
in the atmosphere. Marine biological sources may contribute signifi  cantly to atmospheric aerosols. 
Biogenic materials reacting in and on the surface of sea-salt aerosols produce some signifi  cant 
atmospheric chemical species, such as halogen radicals, and in so doing infl  uence cycles involving 
atmospheric sulfur, nitrogen, and oxidants.
As discussed later in this chapter, particulate matter originates from a wide variety of sources 
and processes, ranging from simple grinding of bulk matter to complicated chemical or biochemical 
syntheses. The effects of particulate matter are also widely varied. Possible effects on climate are 
discussed in Chapter 14. Either by itself or in combination with gaseous pollutants, particulate mat-
ter may be detrimental to human health. Atmospheric particles may damage materials, reduce vis-
ibility, and cause undesirable esthetic effects. It is now recognized that very small particles have a 
particularly high potential for harm, including adverse health effects, and specifi  c regulations now 
apply to particles with a diameter of 2.5 mm or less.
For the most part, aerosols consist of carbonaceous material, metal oxides and glasses, dissolved 
ionic species (electrolytes), and ionic solids. The predominant constituents are carbonaceous material, 
water, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium nitrogen, and silicon. The composition of aerosol particles varies 
signifi  cantly with size. The very small particles tend to be acidic and often originate from gases, such 
a s  f r o m  t h e  c o n v e r s i o n  o f  S O2 to H2SO4. Larger particles tend to consist of materials generated 
mechanically, such as by the grinding of limestone, and have a greater tendency to be basic.266 Environmental Chemistry
10.2 PHYSICAL BEHAVIOR OF PARTICLES IN THE ATMOSPHERE
As shown in Figure 10.2, atmospheric particles undergo a number of processes in the atmosphere. Small 
colloidal particles are subject to diffusion processes . Smaller particles coagulate  together to form larger 
particles. Sedimentation or dry deposition of particles, which have often reached suffi  cient size to settle 
by coagulation, is one of two major mechanisms for particle removal from the atmosphere. In many 
areas, dry deposition on vegetation is a signifi  cant mechanism for particle removal.1 In addition to sedi-
mentation, the other major pathway for particle removal from the atmosphere is scavenging  by rain-
drops and other forms of precipitation. Particles also react with atmospheric gases.
Particle size  usually expresses the diameter of a particle, though sometimes it is used to denote the 
radius. The sizes of atmospheric particles cover several orders of magnitude from <0.01 mm to around 
100 mm. Volume and mass of particles are a function of d3, where d is the particle diameter. As a con-
sequence, in general, the total mass of atmospheric particles is concentrated in the larger size range, 
whereas the total number and surface area of atmospheric particles are in the smaller fraction.
The rate at which a particle settles is a function of particle diameter and density. The settling rate 
is important in determining the effect of the particle on the atmosphere. For spherical particles 
greater than approximately 1 mm in diameter, Stokes’ law applies,

where v is the settling velocity in cm/s, g is the acceleration of gravity in cm/s2, r1 is the density of 
the particle in g/cm3, r2 is the density of air in g/cm3, and h is the viscosity of air in poise. Stokes’ 
law can also be used to express the effective diameter of an irregular nonspherical particle. These 
are called Stokes diameters  (aerodynamic diameters) and are normally the ones given when particle 
diameters are expressed. Furthermore, since the density of a particle is often not known, an arbi-
trary density of 1 g/cm3 is conventionally assigned to r1; when this is done, the diameter calculated 
from Equation 10.1 is called the reduced sedimentation diameter .
10.2.1 S IZE AND SETTLING  OF ATMOSPHERIC  PARTICLES
Most kinds of aerosol particles have unknown diameters and densities and occur over a range of sizes. 
For such particles, the term mass median diameter  (MMD) may be used to describe aerodynamically 
equivalent spheres having an assigned density of 1 g/cm3 at a 50% mass collection effi  ciency, as deter-
mined in sampling devices calibrated with spherical aerosol particles having a known, uniform size. 
(Polystyrene latex is commonly used as a material for the preparation of such standard aerosols.) 
The determination of MMD is accomplished by plotting the log of particle size as a function of the 
percentage of particles smaller than the given size on a probability scale. Two such plots are shown in 
Figure 10.3. It is seen from the plot that particles of aerosol X have a MMD of 2.0 mm (ordinate cor-
responding to 50% on the abscissa). In the case of aerosol Y, linear extrapolation to sizes below the 
lower measurable size limit of about 0.7 mm gives an estimated value of 0.5 mm for the MMD.
The settling characteristics of particles smaller than about 1 mm in diameter deviate from Stokes’ 
law because the settling particles “slip between” air molecules. Extremely small particles are sub-
ject to Brownian motion  resulting from random movement due to collisions with air molecules and 
do not obey Stokes’ law. Deviations are also observed for particles above 10 mm in diameter because 
they settle rapidly and generate turbulence as they fall.
10.3 PHYSICAL PROCESSES FOR PARTICLE FORMATION
Dispersion aerosols , such as dusts, formed from the disintegration of larger particles are usually 
above 1 mm in size. Typical processes for forming dispersion aerosols include evolution of dust from 
coal grinding, formation of spray in cooling towers, and blowing of dirt from dry soil.Diﬀusion

Many dispersion aerosols originate from natural sources such as sea spray, windblown dust, and 
volcanic dust. However, a vast variety of human activities break up material and  disperse it to the 
atmosphere. “All terrain” vehicles churn across desert lands, coating fragile desert plants with 
layers of dispersed dust. Quarries and rock crushers spew out plumes of ground rock. Cultivation

America are now sometimes affl  icted by plumes of particles stirred up by windstorms in Asia that 
disturb soil converted to desert by global warming, improper cultivation, and overgrazing. 
However, since much more energy is required to break material down into small particles than is 
required for or released by the synthesis of particles through chemical synthesis or the adhesion of 
smaller particles, most dispersion aerosols are relatively large. Larger particles tend to have fewer 
harmful effects than smaller ones. As examples, larger particles are less respirable  in that they do 
not penetrate so far into the lungs as smaller ones, and larger particles are relatively easier to remove 
from air pollution effl  uent sources.
Huge volcanic eruptions can cause highly elevated levels of particles in the atmosphere. These 
can be from the physical process of simply blowing as much as several cubic kilometers of volcanic 
ash as high as the stratosphere. As noted below, volcanic gases can produce secondary particles by 
chemical processes.
10.4 CHEMICAL PROCESSES FOR PARTICLE FORMATION
Chemical processes in the atmosphere convert large quantities of atmospheric gases to particulate 
matter.2 Among the chemical species most responsible for this conversion are the organic pollut-
ants and nitrogen oxides that cause formation of ozone and photochemical smog (see Chapter 13) 
in the troposphere. Smaller particles formed by chemical processes tend to have higher contents 
of organic matter than do coarser particles. To an extent, therefore, control of hydrocarbon and 
NOx emissions to reduce smog also curtails atmospheric particulate matter pollution.
A major fraction of ambient particulate matter arises from atmospheric gas-to-particle conver-
sion. Attempts to reduce particulate matter levels require control of the same organic and nitrogen 
oxide (NOx ) emissions that are precursors to urban and regional ozone formation.X particles

Most chemical processes that produce particles are combustion processes, including fossil-
fuel-fi  red power plants; incinerators; home furnaces, fi  replaces, and stoves; cement kilns; internal 
combustion engines; forest, brush, and grass fi  res; and active volcanoes. Particles from combus-
tion sources tend to occur in a size range below 1 mm. Such very small particles are  particularly 
important because they are most readily carried into the alveoli of lungs (see pulmonary route of 
exposure to toxicants in Chapter 22) and they are likely to be enriched in more hazardous constitu-
ents, such as toxic heavy metals and arsenic. The pattern of occurrence of such trace  elements can 
enable the use of small particle analysis for tracking sources of particulate pollutants.
10.4.1 I NORGANIC  PARTICLES
Metal oxides constitute a major class of inorganic particles in the atmosphere. These are formed 
whenever fuels containing metals are burned. For example, particulate iron oxide is formed during 
the combustion of pyrite-containing coal:
 3FeS2 + 8O2 Æ Fe3O4 + 6SO2 (10.2)
Organic vanadium in residual fuel oil is converted to particulate vanadium oxide. Part of the  calcium 
carbonate in the ash fraction of coal is converted to calcium oxide and is emitted into the atmo-
sphere through the stack:
 CaCO3 + heat Æ CaO + CO2 (10.3)
A common process for the formation of aerosol mists involves the oxidation of atmospheric 
 sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid, a hygroscopic substance that accumulates atmospheric water to form 
small liquid droplets:
 2SO2 + O2 + 2H2O Æ 2H2SO4  (10.4)
In the presence of basic air pollutants, such as ammonia or calcium oxide, the sulfuric acid reacts to 
form salts:
 H2SO4(droplet ) + 2NH3 (g) Æ (NH4)2SO4(droplet ) (10.5)
 H2SO4(droplet ) + CaO ( s) Æ CaSO4(droplet ) + H2O (10.6)
Under low-humidity conditions, water is lost from these droplets and a solid aerosol is formed.
Volcanic SO2 and H2S gases can be precursors to large quantities of atmospheric particulate 
sulfuric acid and sulfates. A study of the 1982 eruption of El Chichón volcano in Mexico showed 
that volcanic glass, sodium chloride, and sulfate from the volcano were deposited in snow in 
Greenland. The June 15, 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines caused perceptible 
perturbations in the earth’s atmospheric solar and infrared radiation transmission.
Nitrogen in ammonium and nitrate salts is a common constituent of inorganic particulate matter. 
Particulate ammonium nitrate and ammonium chloride are produced by the following reversible 
reactions:
 + /arrowpairrightleft33 4 3NH ( ) HNO ( ) NH NO ( , ) g g s particulate (10.7)
 + /arrowpairrightleft34NH ( ) HCl( ) NH Cl( , ) g g s particulate (10.8)
Ammonium nitrate, chloride, and sulfate salts in the atmosphere are corrosive to metals such as the 
metal contacts in electrical relays.
Biogenic sources provide the ingredients for the production of signifi  cant amounts of particu-
late ammonium, nitrate, and sulfate salts. Ammonia is evolved from the decay of organic matter. 
Gaseous sulfur enters the atmosphere as H2S gas from the decay of sulfur-containing organic 270 Environmental Chemistry
matter and from anoxic microbial processes using sulfate as an electron receptor (oxidant). Marine 
organisms evolve large quantities of dimethyl sulfi  de, (CH3)2S, from oceans. Hy drogen sulfi  de 
and dimethyl sulfi  de are oxidized to sulfate in the atmosphere by atmospheric chemical  processes. 
Microorganisms evolve signifi  cant quantities of gaseous N2O, which becomes oxidized in the 
atmosphere to nitrate. Some atmospheric ammonia is also oxidized to nitrate.
The preceding examples show several ways in which solid or liquid inorganic aerosols are formed 
by chemical reactions. Such reactions constitute an important general process for the formation of 
aerosols, particularly the smaller particles.
10.4.2 O RGANIC  PARTICLES
A signifi  cant portion of organic particulate matter is produced by internal combustion engines in 
complicated processes that involve pyrolysis and pyrosynthesis processes. These products may 
include nitrogen-containing compounds and oxidized hydrocarbon polymers. Engine lubricating oil 
and its additives may also contribute to organic particulate matter.
10.4.3 P OLYCYCLIC  AROMATIC  HYDROCARBON  SYNTHESIS
The organic particles of greatest concern are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), which consist 
of condensed ring aromatic (aryl) molecules. The most often cited example of a PAH compound is 
benzo(a)pyrene, a compound that the body can metabolize to a carcinogenic form:
Benzo(a)pyrene
P AHs and deri vati v es from them are f ormed during incomplete combustion of hy drocarbons. 
Although natural combustion processes, such as forest and grass fi  res, produce PAHs, most of the 
especially troublesome pollutant PAHs come from anthrospheric processes.3 PAHs may be synthe-
sized from saturated hydrocarbons under oxygen-defi  cient conditions. Hydrocarbons with very low 
molecular masses, including even methane, may act as precursors for the polycyclic aromatic com-
pounds. Low-molar-mass hydrocarbons form PAHs by pyrosynthesis . This happens at temperatures 
exceeding approximately 500°C at which carbon–hydrogen and carbon–carbon bonds are broken to 
form free radicals. These radicals undergo dehydrogenation and combine chemically to form aryl 
ring structures, which are resistant to thermal degradation. The basic process for the formation of 
such rings from pyrosynthesis starting with ethane is,

which results in the formation of stable PAH structures. The tendency of hydrocarbons to form PAHs by 
pyrosynthesis varies in the order aromatics > cycloolefi  ns > olefi  ns > paraffi  n’s. The existing ring struc-
ture of cyclic compounds is conducive to PAH formation. Unsaturated compounds are  especially suscep-
tible to the addition reactions involved in PAH formation.
Polycyclic aromatic compounds may be formed from higher alkanes present in fuels and plant 
materials by the process of pyrolysis , the “cracking” of organic compounds to form smaller and less 
stable molecules and radicals.Particles in the Atmosphere 271
10.5 THE COMPOSITION OF INORGANIC PARTICLES
Figure 10.4 illustrates the basic factors responsible for the composition of inorganic particulate 
 matter. In general, the proportions of elements in atmospheric particulate matter refl  ect relative 
abundances of elements in the parent material.
The source of particulate matter is refl  ected in its elemental composition, taking into consider-
ation chemical reactions that may change the composition. For example, particulate matter largely 
from an ocean spray origin in a coastal area receiving sulfur dioxide pollution may show anoma-
lously high sulfate and corresponding low chloride content. The sulfate comes from atmospheric 
oxidation of sulfur dioxide to form nonvolatile ionic sulfate, whereas some chloride originally from 
the NaCl in the seawater may be lost from the solid aerosol as volatile HCl:
 2SO2 + O2 + 2H2O Æ 2H2SO4 (10.9)
 H2SO4 + 2NaCl ( particulate ) Æ Na2SO4 (particulate ) + 2HCl (10.10)
Acids other than sulfuric acid can also be involved in the modifi  cation of sea-salt particles. The 
most common such acid is nitric acid formed by reactions of nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere. 
Traces of nitrate salts may be found among sea-salt particles.
Among the constituents of inorganic particulate matter found in polluted atmospheres are salts, 
oxides, nitrogen compounds, sulfur compounds, various metals, and radionuclides. In coastal areas, 
sodium and chlorine get into atmospheric particles as sodium chloride from sea spray. The major 
trace elements that typically occur at levels above 1 mg/m3 in particulate matter are aluminum, 
 calcium,  carbon, iron, potassium, sodium, and silicon; note that most of these tend to originate from

terrestrial sources. Lesser quantities of copper, lead, titanium, and zinc and even lower levels of 
antimony,  beryllium, bismuth, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, cesium, lithium, manganese, nickel, 
rubidium,  selenium, strontium, and vanadium are commonly observed. The likely sources of some 
of these  elements are given below:
Al, Fe, Ca, Si• : Soil erosion, rock dust, coal combustion
C• : Incomplete combustion of carbonaceous fuels
Na, Cl• : Marine aerosols, chloride from incineration of organohalide polymer wastes
Sb, Se• : Very volatile elements, possibly from the combustion of oil, coal, or refuse
V• : Combustion of residual petroleum (present at very high levels in residues from Venezuelan 
crude oil)
Zn• : Tends to occur in small particles, probably from combustion
Pb• : Combustion of fuels and wastes containing lead
Particulate carbon as soot, carbon black, coke, and graphite originates from auto and truck 
exhausts, heating furnaces, incinerators, power plants, and steel and foundry operations, and com-
poses one of the more visible and troublesome particulate air pollutants. Because of its good adsor-
bent properties, carbon can be a carrier of gaseous and other particulate pollutants. Both nitrogen 
and sulfur compounds in exhaust gases are adsorbed onto particulate carbon that is emitted by 
poorly controlled diesel engines. Particulate carbon surfaces may catalyze some heterogeneous 
atmospheric reactions, including the important conversion of SO2 into sulfate.
10.5.1 F LY ASH
Much of the mineral particulate matter in a polluted atmosphere is in the form of oxides and other 
compounds produced during the combustion of high-ash fossil fuel. Some of the mineral matter in 
fossil fuels such as coal or lignite is converted during combustion into a fused, glassy bottom ash 
that presents no air pollution problems. Smaller particles of fl  y ash  enter furnace fl  ues and are effi  -
ciently collected in a properly equipped stack system. However, some fl  y ash escapes through the 
stack and enters the atmosphere. Unfortunately, the fl  y ash thus released tends to consist of smaller 
particles that do the most damage to human health, plants, and visibility.
The composition of fl  y ash varies widely, depending upon the fuel. The predominant constituents 
are oxides of aluminum, calcium, iron, and silicon. Other elements that occur in fl  y ash are magne-
sium, sulfur, titanium, phosphorus, potassium, and sodium. Elemental carbon (soot and carbon 
black) is a signifi  cant fl  y ash constituent.
The size of fl  y ash particles is a very important factor in determining their removal from stack 
gas and their ability to enter the body through the respiratory tract. Fly ash from coal-fi  red utility 
boilers has shown a bimodal (two peak) distribution of size, with a peak at about 0.1 mm as  illustrated 
in Figure 10.5. Although only about 1–2% of the total fl  y ash mass is in the smaller size fraction, it 
includes the vast majority of the total number of particles and particle surface area. Submicrometer 
particles probably result from a volatilization–condensation process during combustion, as refl  ected 
in a higher concentration of more volatile elements such as As, Sb, Hg, and Zn. In addition to their 
being relatively much more respirable and potentially toxic, the very small particles are the most 
diffi cult to remove by electrostatic precipitators and bag houses (see Section 10.12).
10.5.2 A SBESTOS
Asbestos  is the name given to a group of fi  brous silicate minerals, typically those of the serpentine 
group, approximate formula Mg3P(Si2O5)(OH)4. The tensile strength, fl  exibility, and nonfl  ammabi-
lity of asbestos have led to many uses of this material. In 1973, annual U.S. consumption of asbestos Particles in the Atmosphere 273
peaked at 652,000 metric tons for applications including brake linings and pads, roofi  ng products, 
structural materials, cement/asbestos pipe, gaskets, heat-resistant packing, and specialty papers. By 
1988, because of fi  ndings regarding the adverse health effects of inhaled asbestos, annual consump-
tion had dropped to 85,000 metric tons. In 1989, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
announced regulations that phased out most uses of asbestos by 1996, and now virtually no asbestos 
is used in the United States.
Asbestos is of concern as an air pollutant because when inhaled it may cause asbestosis (a pneu-
monia condition), mesothelioma (tumor of the mesothelial tissue lining the chest cavity adjacent to 
the lungs), and bronchogenic carcinoma (cancer originating with the air passages in the lungs). 
Therefore, uses of asbestos have been severely curtailed and widespread programs have been under-
taken to remove the material from buildings.
10.6 TOXIC METALS IN THE ATMOSPHERE 
Some of the metals found predominantly as particulate matter in polluted atmospheres are known 
to be hazardous to human health.4 All of these except beryllium are so-called “heavy metals.” Lead 
is the toxic metal of greatest concern in the urban atmosphere because it comes closest to being 
present at a toxic level; mercury ranks second. Others include beryllium, cadmium, chromium, 
vanadium, nickel, and arsenic (a metalloid).
10.6.1 A TMOSPHERIC  MERCURY
Atmospheric mercury is of concern because of its toxicity, volatility, and mobility. Some atmo-
spheric mercury is associated with particulate matter. Much of the mercury entering the atmosphere 
does so as volatile elemental mercury from coal combustion and volcanoes. Volatile organomercury 
compounds such as dimethylmercury, (CH3)2Hg, and monomethylmercury salts, such as CH3HgBr, 
are also encountered in the atmosphere.
10.6.2 A TMOSPHERIC  LEAD
Lead is one of six priority pollutants regulated by the U.S. EPA (see Section 10.9). With the reduction 
of leaded fuels, atmospheric lead is of less concern than it used to be. However, during the decades 3000

range is the mass of the particles in that size range.274 Environmental Chemistry
when leaded gasoline containing tetraethyllead (Pb(C2H5)4) was the predominant automotive fuel, 
particulate lead halides were emitted in large quantities. This occurred through the action of dichlo-
roethane and dibromoethane added as halogenated scavengers to prevent the accumulation of lead 
oxides inside engines. The lead halides formed by the chemical process represented by Equation 10.11 
are volatile enough to exit through the exhaust system but condense in the air to form particles. 
During the period of peak usage of leaded gasoline in the early 1970s, about 200,000 tons of lead 
were entering the atmosphere each year by this route in the United States.

10.6.3 A TMOSPHERIC  BERYLLIUM
Only about 200 metric tons of beryllium are consumed each year in the United States for the formu-
lation of specialty alloys used in electrical equipment, electronic instrumentation, space gear, and 
nuclear reactor components. Therefore, distribution of beryllium is quite limited compared to other 
toxic substances produced in larger quantities, such as lead.
During the 1940s and 1950s, the toxicity of beryllium and beryllium compounds became widely 
recognized; it has the lowest allowable limit in the atmosphere of all the elements. One of the main 
results of the recognition of beryllium toxicity hazards was the elimination of this element from 
phosphors (coatings that produce visible light from ultraviolet light) in fl  uorescent lamps.
10.7 RADIOACTIVE PARTICLES
Some of the radioactivity detected in atmospheric particles is of natural origin. This activity includes 
that produced when cosmic rays act on nuclei in the atmosphere to produce radionuclides, including 
7Be, 10Be, 14C, 39Cl, 3H, 22Na, 32P, and 33P. A sign ifi  cant natural source of radionuclides in the atmo-
sphere is radon , a noble gas product of radium decay. Radon may enter the atmosphere as either of 
two isotopes, 222Rn (half-life: 3.8 days) and 220Rn (half-life: 54.5 s). Both are alpha emitters in decay 
chains that terminate with stable isotopes of lead. The initial decay products, 218Po and 216Po, are 
nongaseous and adhere readily to atmospheric particulate matter.
The catastrophic 1986 meltdown and fi  re at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in the former Soviet 
Union spread large quantities of radioactive materials over a wide area of Europe. Much of this 
radioactivity was in the form of particles.
One of the more serious problems in connection with radon is that of radioactivity originating 
from uranium mine tailings that have been used in some areas as backfi  ll, soil conditioner, and a 
base for building foundations. Radon produced by the decay of radium exudes from foundations and 
walls constructed on tailings. Higher than normal levels of radioactivity have been found in some 
structures in the city of Grand Junction, Colorado, where uranium mill tailings have been used 
extensively in construction. Some medical authorities have suggested that the rates of birth defects 
and infant cancer in areas where uranium mill tailings have been used in residential construction 
are signifi  cantly higher than normal. The combustion of fossil fuels introduces radioactivity into the 
atmosphere in the form of radionuclides contained in fl  y ash. Large coal-fi  red power plants lacking 
ash-control equipment may introduce up to several hundred millicuries of radionuclides into the 
atmosphere each year, far more than either an equivalent nuclear or oil-fi  red power plant.
The radioactive noble gas 85Kr (half - lif e : 1 0 .3 y ears ) is emi tted in to the atmosphere b y the  
operation of nuclear reactors and the processing of spent reactor fuels. In general, other radionu-
clides produced by reactor operation are either chemically reactive and can be removed from the 
reactor effl  uent, or have such short half-lives that a short time delay prior to emission prevents 
their leaving the reactor. Although 85Kr is largely contained in spent reactor fuel during reactor Particles in the Atmosphere 275
operation, nuclear fuel reprocessing releases most of this gas from the fuel elements. Fortunately, 
biota cannot concentrate this chemically unreactive element.
The above-ground detonation of nuclear weapons can add large amounts of radioactive particu-
late matter to the atmosphere. Among the radioisotopes that have been detected in rainfall collected 
after atmospheric nuclear weapon detonation are 91Y, 141Ce, 144Ce, 147Nd, 147Pm, 149Pm, 151Sm, 153Sm, 
155Eu, 156Eu, 89Sr, 90Sr, 115mCd, 129mTe, 131I, 132Te, and 140Ba. (Note that “m” denotes a metastable state 
that decays by gamma-ray emission to an isotope of the same element.) The rate of travel of radioac-
tive particles through the atmosphere is a function of particle size. Appreciable fractionation of 
nuclear debris is observed because of differences in the rates at which the various debris constitu-
ents move through the atmosphere.
10.8 THE COMPOSITION OF ORGANIC PARTICLES
The composition of organic particulate matter refl  ects its origins. Much organic particulate matter, 
such as the organic particles characteristic of photochemical smog (see Chapter 13), is formed as 
secondary material that results from photochemical processes operating on volatile and semivola-
tile organic compounds emitted to the atmosphere. The compounds emitted to the atmosphere are 
predominantly hydrocarbon in nature and the incorporation of oxygen and/or nitrogen through 
atmospheric chemical processes gives less volatile material in the form of organic particles.
Organic atmospheric particles occur in a wide variety of compounds. For analysis, such particles 
can be collected onto a fi  lter; extracted with organic solvents; fractionated into neutral, acid, and 
basic groups; and analyzed for specifi  c constituents by chromatography and mass spectrometry. The 
neutral group contains predominantly hydrocarbons, including aliphatic, aromatic, and oxygenated 
fractions. The aliphatic fraction of the neutral group contains a high percentage of long-chain hydro-
carbons, predominantly those with 16–28 carbon atoms. These relatively unreactive compounds are 
not particularly toxic and do not participate strongly in atmospheric chemical reactions. The aro-
matic fraction, however, contains carcinogenic PAHs, which are discussed below. Aldehydes, 
ketones, epoxides, peroxides, esters, quinones, and lactones are found among the oxygenated neu-
tral components, some of which may be mutagenic or carcinogenic. The acidic group contains long-
chain fatty acids and nonvolatile phenols. Among the acids recovered from air-pollutant particulate 
matter are lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic, behenic, oleic, and linoleic acids. The basic group con-
sists largely of alkaline N-heterocyclic hydrocarbons such as acridine:
AcridineN
10.8.1 PAH S
PAHs in atmospheric particles have received a great deal of attention because of the known carci-
nogenic effects of some of these compounds, which are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 23. 
Prominent among these compounds are benzo(a)pyrene, benz(a)anthracene, chrysene, benzo(e)
pyrene, benz(e)acephenanthrylene, benzo(j)fl  uoranthene, and indenol. Some representative struc-
tures of PAH compounds are given below:
Benzo(j)fluoranthene Chrysene Benzo(a)pyrene276 Environmental Chemistry
Elevated levels of PAH compounds of up to about 20 mg/m3 are found in the atmosphere. Elevated 
levels of PAHs are most likely to be encountered in polluted urban atmospheres, and in the vicinity 
of natural fi  res such as forest and prairie fi  res. Coal furnace stack gas may contain over 1000 mg/m3 
of PAH compounds, and cigarette smoke may contain almost 100 mg/m3.
Atmospheric PAHs are found almost exclusively in the solid phase, largely sorbed to soot parti-
cles. Soot itself is a highly condensed product of PAHs. Soot contains 1–3% hydrogen and 5–10% 
oxygen, the latter due to partial surface oxidation. Benzo(a)pyrene adsorbed on soot disappears very 
rapidly in the presence of light, yielding oxygenated products; the large surface area of the particle 
contributes to the high rate of reaction. Oxidation products of benzo(a)pyrene include epoxides, 
quinones, phenols, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids as illustrated by the composite structures shown 
below:

10.8.2 C ARBONACEOUS  PARTICLES  FROM DIESEL ENGINES
Diesel engines emit signifi  cant levels of carbonaceous particles. Although an appreciable fraction of 
these particles have aerodynamic diameters <1 mm, they may exist as aggregates of several thou-
sand s mall er parti c l es in c l us ters u p to 30 mm in diameter. This particulate matter is composed 
largely of elemental carbon, although as much as 40% of the particle mass consists of organic-
extractable hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon derivatives including organosulfur and organonitrogen 
compounds. As noted in Secti on 1 0 . 1 2, modern di ese l en gines emp l o y fi  lters to remove exhaust 
particles, which are periodically burned off of the fi  lter surfaces.
10.9 EFFECTS OF PARTICLES
Atmospheric particles have numerous effects. Because of their pollutant effects, particles are one of 
six so-called criteria pollutants  for which the U.S. EPA is required to issue standards. (The other 
fi v e  pri o ri ty  po ll u tan ts  are  s ulfur  di o xi d e ,  c arbo n  m o n o xi d e ,  o zo n e ,  ni tr o g e n  di o xi d e ,  an d  l ead . )  
Standards for atmospheric particulate matter were fi  rst issued by EPA in 1971 with revisions in 
1987, 1997, and 2006, most recently with special attention given to particles of a size of 2.5 mm and 
smaller (PM2.5).
The most obvious effect of atmospheric particles is reduction and distortion of visibility. They 
provide active surfaces upon which heterogeneous atmospheric chemical reactions can occur thereby 
strongly infl  uencing air pollution phenomena. The ability of particles to act as nucleation bodies for 
the condensation of atmospheric water vapor can infl  uence precipitation and weather.5
The most visible effects of aerosol particles upon air quality result from their optical effects. 
Particles smaller than about 0.1 mm in diameter scatter light much like molecules, that is, Rayleigh 
scattering. Generally, such particles have an insignifi  cant effect upon visibility in the atmosphere. 
The light-scattering and intercepting properties of particles larger than 1 mm are approximately Particles in the Atmosphere 277
proportional to the particles’ cross-sectional areas. Particles of 0.1–1 mm cause interference phe-
nomena because they are about the same dimensions as the wavelengths of visible light, so their 
light-scattering effects are especially pronounced. 
Atmospheric particles inhaled through the respiratory tract may damage health, and exposure to 
particles in the atmosphere has been linked to a number of health effects including aggravated 
asthma and premature death from heart and lung diseases. Relatively large particles are likely to be 
retained in the nasal cavity and in the pharynx, whereas very small particles below 2.5 mm in size 
are respirable particles  that are likely to reach the lungs and be retained by them. The respiratory 
system possesses mechanisms for the expulsion of inhaled particles. In the ciliated region of the 
respiratory system, particles are carried as far as the entrance to the gastrointestinal tract by a fl  ow 
of mucus. Macrophages in the nonciliated pulmonary regions carry particles to the ciliated region.
The respiratory system may be damaged directly by particulate matter. In addition, the particu-
late material or soluble components of it may enter the blood system or lymph system through the 
lungs to be transported to organs some distance from the lungs and have a detrimental effect on 
these organs. Particles cleared from the respiratory tract are to a large extent swallowed into the 
gastrointestinal tract.
A strong correlation has been found between increases in the daily mortality rate and acute epi-
sodes of air pollution including particulate pollution. In such cases, high levels of particulate matter 
are accompanied by elevated concentrations of SO2 and other pollutants that may have adverse 
health effects in combination with particles.
A classic case of adverse health effects associated with high levels of atmospheric particles 
occurred in London during an incident in a 5-day period in 1952 in which a temperature inversion 
stabilized a mass of air laden with fog, coal smoke, and other particles. Epidemiological data from 
this period showed approximately 4000 excess deaths. Ultrafi  ne particles <0.1 mm in size and acid-
forming constituents have been suspected of contributing to the deaths. Lung and respiratory tract 
samples archived from victims of this event and subjected to electron microscopic examination 
50 years later showed carbonaceous soot predominant in the retained particles in the respiratory 
tract. Particles bearing metals including lead, zinc, and tin were also found.
10.9.1 P ARTITIONING  OF SEMIVOLATILE  ORGANIC  SUBSTANCES  BETWEEN  AIR AND PARTICLES
An effect of atmospheric particles is the partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds such as 
PCBs between air and particles. As shown in Figure 10.6, these particles can act as carriers to 
deposit such compounds from the atmosphere onto surfaces in the other environmental spheres. 
Binding with particles can infl  uence the reactivity of organic compounds, particularly with respect 
to oxidation.
10.10 WATER AS PARTICULATE MATTER
Droplets of water are very widespread in the atmosphere. Although a natural phenomenon, such 
droplets can have signifi  cant and sometimes harmful effects. The most important such consequence 
is reduction of visibility, with accompanying detrimental effects on driving, fl  ying, and boat naviga-
tion. Water droplets in fog act as carriers of pollutants. The most important of these are solutions of 
corrosive salts, particularly ammonium nitrates and sulfates, and solutions of strong acids. As dis-
cussed in Chapter 14, Section 14.4, the pH of water in acidic mist droplets collected during a Los 
Angeles acidic fog has been as low as 1.7, far below that of acidic precipitation. Such acidic mist can 
be especially damaging to the respiratory tract because it is very penetrating.
Arguably the most signifi  cant effect of water droplets in the atmosphere is as aquatic media in 
which important atmospheric chemical processes occur. The single most signifi  cant such process 
may well be the oxidation of S(IV) species to sulfuric acid and sulfate salts, a process that may be 
facilitated by the presence of iron. The S(IV) species so oxidized include SO2 (aq), HSO3-, and SO32−. 278 Environmental Chemistry
Another important oxidation that takes place in atmospheric water droplets is the oxidation of 
 aldehydes to organic carboxylic acids.
The hydroxyl radical, HO•, is very important in initiating atmospheric oxidation reactions such 
as those noted above. Hydroxyl radical as HO• can enter water droplets from the gas-phase atmo-
sphere, it can be produced in water droplets photochemically, or it can be generated from H2O2 and 
•O2- radical ion, which dissolve in water from the gas phase and then produce HO• by solution chemi-
cal reaction:
 H2O2 + •O2- Æ HO• + O2 + OH- (10.12)
Several solutes can react photochemically in aqueous solution (as opposed to the gas phase) to 
produce hydroxyl radical. One of these is hydrogen peroxide:
 H2O2(aq) + hn Æ 2HO • (aq) (10.13)
Nitrite as NO2- or HNO2, nitrate (NO3-), and iron(III) as Fe(OH)2+ (aq) can also react photochemi-
cally in aqueous solution to produce HO•. It has been observed that ultraviolet radiation at 313 nm 
and simulated sunlight can react to produce HO• radical in authentic samples of water collected 
from cloud and fog sources.6 Based on the results of this study and related investigations, it may be 
concluded that the aqueous-phase formation of hydroxyl radical is an important, and in some cases 
dominant, means by which this key atmospheric oxidant is introduced into atmospheric water 
droplets.
10.11 ATMOSPHERIC CHEMICAL REACTIONS INVOLVING PARTICLES
In recent years there has been an increasing recognition of the importance in atmospheric chemi-

compared to the heterogeneous chemistry that involves particles. Particles may serve as sources

and sinks of atmospheric chemical reaction participant species. Solid particle surfaces may 
adsorb reactants and products, serve a catalytic function, exchange electrical charge, and absorb 
photons of electromagnetic radiation, thus acting as photocatalytic surfaces. Liquid water drop-
lets may act as media for solution reactions including photochemical reactions that occur in 
solution.
Reactions on particle surfaces are very diffi  cult to study because of factors such as variability 
in atmospheric particulate matter, the virtual impossibility of duplicating conditions that occur 
with suspended particles in the atmosphere, and the effects of water vapor and water condensed 
on particle surfaces. Prominent among solid particles that serve as reaction sites are soot and 
elemental carbon, oxides, carbonates, silica, and mineral dust. Particles may be liquid aerosols, 
dry solids, or solids with deliquescent surfaces. They exhibit wide variations in diameter, surface 
area, and chemical composition. Some of the atmospheric chemical processes that likely occur on 
particle surfaces are N2O5 hydrolysis, surface aging of soot particles by surface oxidation, genera-
tion of HONO (a precursor to HO•) by reaction of nitrogen oxides and water vapor on soot and 
silica particle surfaces, reactions of HO• with nonvolatile chemical species sorbed to particle 
surfaces, uptake and reactions of carbonyl compounds such as acetone on particulate oxides and 
mineral dusts, and processes involving particles that infl  uence residence times of atmospheric 
chemicals.
An interesting example of chemical processes on particle surfaces is the accumulation of sulfate 
on the surfaces of sodium chloride particles produced by evaporation of water from seawater spray 
droplets. This phenomenon has been attributed in part to a process that begins with the reaction of 
deliquesced (moist) sodium chloride with hydroxyl radical7:

to produce sodium hypochlorite, which has been observed on the particle surfaces. The NaOH on 
the surface reacts with atmospheric sulfuric acid,
 2NaOH  + H2SO4 Æ Na2SO4 + H2O (10.16)
to produce sodium sulfate. The basic sodium hydroxide on the surface also facilitates oxidation of 
atmospheric SO2:
 SO2 + 2NaOH  + 1
2O2 Æ Na2SO4 + H2O (10.17)
The net result is that the oxidation of atmospheric sulfur dioxide is promoted and particulate sodium 
chloride contains signifi  cant amounts of sodium sulfate.
10.12 CONTROL OF PARTICULATE EMISSIONS
The removal of particulate matter from gas streams is the most widely practiced means of air 
 pollution control. A number of devices have been developed for this purpose that differ widely in 
effectiveness, complexity, and cost. The selection of a particle removal system for a gaseous waste 
stream depends upon the particle loading, nature of particles (size distribution), and type of gas-
scrubbing system used.
10.12.1 P ARTICLE  REMOVAL  BY SEDIMENTATION  AND INERTIA
The simplest means of particulate matter removal is sedimentation , a phenomenon that occurs con-
tinuously in nature. Gravitational settling chambers may be employed for the removal of particles 
from gas streams by simply settling under the infl  uence of gravity. These chambers take up large 
amounts of space and have low collection effi  ciencies, particularly for small particles.
Gravitational settling of particles is enhanced by increased particle size, which occurs spontaneously 
by coagulation. Thus, over time, the sizes of particles increase and the number of particles decreases in 
a mass of air that contains particles. Brownian motion of particles less than about 0. 1 mm in size is 
primarily responsible for their contact, enabling coagulation to occur. Particles greater than about 
0.3 mm in radius do not diffuse appreciably and serve primarily as receptors of smaller particles.
Inertial mechanisms  are effective for particle removal. These depend upon the fact that the radius 
of the path of a particle in a rapidly moving, curving air stream is larger than the path of the stream as 
a whole. Therefore, when a gas stream is spun by vanes, a fan, or a tangential gas inlet, the particulate 
matter may be collected on a separator wall because the particles are forced outward by centrifugal 
force. Devices utilizing this mode of operation are called dry centrifugal collectors  (cyclones).
10.12.2 P ARTICLE  FILTRATION
Fabric fi  lters , as their name implies, consist of fabrics that allow the passage of gas but retain par-
ticulate matter. These are used to collect dust in bags contained in structures called baghouses . 
Periodically, the fabric composing the fi  lter is shaken to remove the particles and to reduce back-
pressure to acceptable levels. Typically, the bag is in a tubular confi  guration as shown in Figure 10.8. 
Numerous other confi  gurations are possible. Collected particulate matter is removed from bags by 
mechanical agitation, blowing air on the fabric, or rapid expansion and contraction of the bags.
Although simple, baghouses are generally effective in removing particles from exhaust gas. 
Particles as small as 0.01 mm in diameter are removed, and removal effi  ciency is relatively high for 
particles down to 0.5 mm in diameter. Aided by the development of mechanically strong, heat- resistant 
fabrics from which the bags are fabricated, baghouse installations have increased signifi  cantly in the 
effort to control particulate emissions.Particles in the Atmosphere 281
Diesel engines, especially those in heavy-duty trucks and buses, are major sources of particulate 
matter in urban areas and along highways. Although exhaust particulate fi  lters were developed for 
use on diesel-powered highway vehicles in the latter 1970s, because of advances in engine design 
and control these devices were deemed unnecessary for a number of years. Later fi  ndings regarding 
suspected health effects of diesel particulate matter subsequently led to an increase in interest in 
diesel particulate fi  lters. Devices for controlling diesel emissions, such as those that trap carbona-
ceous particles on ceramic fi  lters followed by cycles in which the accumulated material is burned 
off the fi  lter, have now reached a high level of sophistication and effectiveness. Given the attractive-
ness of the diesel engine for its high fuel economy, diesel particulate fi  lters are becoming common 
equipment on diesel-powered vehicles.
10.12.3 S CRUBBERS
A venturi scrubber passes gas through a device that leads the gas stream through a converging sec-
tion, throat, and diverging section as shown in Figure 10.9. Injection of the scrubbing liquid at right 
angles to incoming gas breaks the liquid into very small droplets, which are ideal for scavenging Collected particulate

particles from the gas stream. In the reduced-pressure (expanding and, therefore, cooling) region of 
the venturi, some condensation can occur of vapor from liquid initially evaporated in the generally 
hot waste gas, adding to the scrubbing effi  ciency . In addition to removing particles, venturis may 
serve as quenchers to cool exhaust gas, and as scrubbers for pollutant gases.
Ionizing wet scrubbers  place an electrical charge on particles upstream from a wet scrubber. 
Larger particles and some gaseous contaminants are removed by scrubbing action. Smaller particles 
tend to induce opposite charges in water droplets in the scrubber and in its packing material and are 
removed by attraction of the opposite charges.
10.12.4 E LECTROSTATIC  REMOVAL
Aerosol particles may acquire electrical charges. In an electric fi  eld, such particles are subjected to 
a force, F, given by
 F  = Eq  (10.18)
where E is the electrical potential gradient between the oppositely charged electrodes in the space 
in which the particle is suspended and q is the electrostatic charge on the particle. This phenomenon 
has been widely used in highly effi  cient electrostatic precipitators , as shown in Figure 10.10. The 
particles acquire a charge when the gas stream is passed through a high-voltage, direct current 
corona. Because of the charge, the particles are attracted to a grounded surface from which they 
may be later removed. Ozone may be produced by the corona discharge.

Pollutants
11.1 INORGANIC POLLUTANT GASES
A number of gaseous inorganic pollutants enter the atmosphere as the result of human activities.1 
Those added in the greatest quantities are CO, SO2, NO, and NO2. (These quantities are relatively 
small compared to the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. The possible environmental effects of incre-
ased atmospheric CO2 levels are discussed in Chapter 14.) Other inorganic pollutant gases include 
NH3, N2O, N2O5, H2S, Cl2, HCl, and HF. Substantial quantities of some of these gases are added to 
the atmosphere each year by human activities. Globally, atmospheric emissions of carbon monoxide, 
sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides are of the order of one to several hundred million tons per year.
11.2 PRODUCTION AND CONTROL OF CARBON MONOXIDE
Carbon monoxide, CO, is a natural constituent of the atmosphere and a pollutant when it is present 
above normal background concentrations. It causes problems in cases of locally high concentrations 
because of its toxicity (see Chapter 24). The overall atmospheric concentration of carbon monoxide 
is about 0.1 ppm, corresponding to a burden in the Earth’s atmosphere of approximately 500 million 
m e t r i c  t o n s  o f  C O  w i t h  a n  a v e r a g e  r e s i d e n c e  t i m e  r a n g i n g  f r o m  3 6  t o  1 1 0  d a y s .  M u c h  o f  t h i s  
CO is present as an intermediate in the oxidation of methane by hydroxyl radical. From Table 9.1 it 
may be seen that the methane content of the atmosphere is about 1.6 ppm, more than 10 times the 
concentration of CO. Therefore, any oxidation process for methane that produces carbon monoxide 
as an intermediate is certain to contribute substantially to the overall carbon monoxide burden, 
probably around two-thirds of the total CO.
Degradation of chlorophyll during the autumn months releases CO, amounting to perhaps as much 
as 20% of the total annual release. Anthropogenic sources account for about 6% of CO  emissions. The 
remainder of atmospheric CO comes from largely unknown sources. These include some plants 
and marine organisms known as siphonophores, an order of Hydrozoa . Carbon mon oxide is also 
produced by decay of plant matter other than chlorophyll.
Because of carbon monoxide emissions from internal combustion engines, the highest levels of 
this toxic gas tend to occur in congested urban areas at times when the maximum number of people 
are exposed, such as during rush hours. At such times, carbon monoxide levels in the atmosphere 
have become as high as 50–100 ppm, defi  nitely hazardous to human health.
Atmospheric levels of carbon monoxide in urban areas show a positive correlation with the den-
sity of vehicular traffi  c and a negative correlation with wind speed. Urban atmospheres may show 
average carbon monoxide levels of the order of several parts per million (ppm), much higher than 
those in remote areas.
11.2.1 C ONTROL  OF CARBON  MONOXIDE  EMISSIONS
Since the internal combustion engine is the primary source of localized pollutant carbon monoxide 
emissions, control measures have been concentrated on the automobile. Carbon monoxide  emissions 286 Environmental Chemistry
may be lowered by employing a leaner air–fuel mixture, that is, one in which the mass ratio of air 
to fuel is relatively high. At air–fuel (mass:mass) ratios exceeding approximately 16:1, an internal 
combustion engine emits very little carbon monoxide.
Modern automobiles use computerized control of engines with catalytic exhaust reactors to cut 
down on carbon monoxide emissions. Excess air is pumped into the exhaust gas, and the mixture is 
passed through a catalytic converter in the exhaust system, resulting in the oxidation of CO to CO2.

The reaction produces hydroperoxyl radical as a product:

HO∑ is regenerated from HOO∑ by the following reactions:
 HOO∑ + NO Æ HO∑ + NO2 (11.3)
 HOO∑ + HOO∑ Æ H2O2 + O2 (11.4)
The latter reaction is followed by photochemical dissociation of H2O2 to regenerate HO∑:
 H2O2 + hn Æ 2HO∑ (11.5)
Methane is also involved through the atmospheric CO/HO∑/CH4 cycle.
Soil microorganisms act to remove CO from the atmosphere. Therefore, soil is a sink for carbon 
monoxide.
11.4 SULFUR DIOXIDE SOURCES AND THE SULFUR CYCLE
Figure 11.1 shows the main aspects of the global sulfur cycle. This cycle involves primarily H2S, 
(CH3)2S, SO2, SO3, and sulfates. There are many uncertainties regarding the sources, reactions, 
and fates of these atmospheric sulfur species. On a global basis, sulfur compounds enter the atmos-
phere to a very large extent through human activities. Approximately 100 million metric tons of 
sulfur per year enter the global atmosphere through anthropogenic activities, primarily as SO2 from 
the  combustion of coal and residual fuel oil. In the United States, anthropogenic emissions of sulfur 
dioxide peaked at 28.8 Tg (teragrams, millions of metric tons) in 1990 and have been reduced by 
more than 40% since then. As the result of air pollution control measures, sulfur dioxide emissions 
in the area of Europe covered by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Environmental 
Monitoring and Evaluation Program fell from 59 T g in 1980 to 27 T g in 1997 and emissions in the 
United Kingdom dropped from 6.4 Tg in 1970 to 1.2 Tg in 1999. Emissions of  sulfur dioxide as mea-
sured directly and inferred by analysis of atmospheric sulfate have continued to drop in Europe.2
The greatest uncertainties in the sulfur cycle have to do with nonanthropogenic sulfur, which 
enters the atmosphere largely as SO2 and H2S from volcanoes, and as (CH3)2S and H2S from the 
biological decay of organic matter and the reduction of sulfate. The single largest source of natural 
sulfur discharged to the atmosphere is now believed to be biogenic dimethyl sulfi  de, (CH3)2S, from 
marine sources. Any H2S that does get into the atmosphere is converted rapidly to SO2 by the 
 following overall process:
 +Æ+3
22 2 2 2 HS O S O HO  (11.6)Gaseous Inorganic Air Pollutants 287
The initial reaction is hydrogen ion abstraction by a hydroxyl radical,
 H2S + HO∑ Æ HS∑ + H2O (11.7)
followed by the following two reactions to give SO2:
 HS∑ + O2 Æ HO∑ + SO (11.8)
 SO + O2 Æ SO2 + O (11.9)
The primary source of anthropogenic sulfur dioxide is coal, from which sulfur must be removed 
at considerable expense to keep sulfur dioxide emissions at acceptable levels. Approximately half of 
the sulfur in coal is in some form of pyrite, FeS2, and the other half is organic sulfur. The production 
of sulfur dioxide by the combustion of pyrite is given by the following reaction:
 4FeS2 + 11O2 Æ 2Fe2O3 + 8SO2 (11.10)
Essentially all of the sulfur is converted to SO2 and only 1% or 2% to SO3.

dioxide. Like many other gaseous pollutants, sulfur dioxide reacts to form particulate matter, which 
then settles or is scavenged from the atmosphere by rainfall or other processes. It is known that high 
levels of air pollution normally are accompanied by a marked increase in aerosol particles and a 
consequent reduction in visibility. Reaction products of sulfur dioxide are thought to be responsible 
for some aerosol formation. Whatever the processes involved, much of the sulfur dioxide in the 
atmosphere is ultimately oxidized to sulfuric acid and sulfate salts, particularly ammonium sulfate 
and ammonium hydrogen sulfate. In fact, it is likely that these sulfates account for the turbid haze 
that covers much of the eastern part of the United States under all atmospheric conditions except 
those characterized by massive intrusions of Arctic air masses during the winter months. The poten-
tial of sulfates to induce climatic change is high and must be taken into account when considering 
control of sulfur dioxide.
Some of the possible ways in which sulfur dioxide may react in the atmosphere are (1) photochemi-
cal reactions; (2) photochemical and chemical reaction s in the presence of nitrogen oxides and/or hydro-
carbons, particularly alkenes; (3) chemical processes in water droplets, particularly those containing 
metal salts and ammonia; and (4) reactions on solid particles in the atmosphere. Since the atmosphere 
is a highly dynamic system with great variations in temperature, composition, humidity, and intensity 
of sunlight, different processes may predominate under various atmospheric conditions.
Photochemical reactions are probably involved in some of the processes resulting in the atmo-
spheric oxidation of SO2. Light with wavelengths above 218 nm is not suffi  ciently energetic to 
bring about the photodissociation of SO2, so direct photochemical reactions in the troposphere are 
of no signifi  cance. The oxidation of sulfur dioxide at the parts-per-million level in an otherwise 
unpolluted atmosphere is a slow process. Therefore, other pollutant species must be involved in the 
process in atmospheres polluted with SO2.
The presence of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides greatly increases the oxidation rate of atmo-
spheric SO2. As discussed in Chapter 13, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and ultraviolet light are the 
ingredients necessary for the formation of photochemical smog. This disagreeable condition is char-
acterized by high levels of various oxidizing species (photochemical oxidants) capable of o xidizing 
SO2. In the smog-prone Los Angeles area, the oxidation of SO2 ranges up to 5–10% per hour. Among 
the oxidizing species present that could bring about this fast reaction are HO∑, HOO∑, O, O3, NO3, 
N2O5, ROO∑, and RO∑. As discussed in Chapters 12 and 13, the latter two species are  reactive 
organic free radicals containing oxygen. Although ozone, O3, is an important product of photochemi-
cal smog, it is believed that the oxidation of SO2 by ozone in the gas phase is too slow to be appre-
ciable, but oxidation by ozone and hydrogen peroxide is probably signifi  cant in water droplets.3
The most important gas-phase reaction leading to the oxidation of SO2 is the addition of an HO∑ 
radical,
 HO∑ + SO2 Æ HOSO2∑ (11.11)
forming a reactive free radical that is eventually converted to a form of sulfate.
In all but relatively dry atmospheres, it is probable that sulfur dioxide is oxidized by reactions 
occurring inside water aerosol droplets. The overall process of sulfur dioxide oxidation in the aque-
ous phase is rather complicated. It involves the transport of gaseous SO2 and oxidant to the aqueous 
phase, diffusion of species in the aqueous droplet, hydrolysis and ionization of SO2, and oxidation 
of SO2 by the following overall process, where {O} represents an oxidizing agent such as H2O2, 
HO∑, or O3 and S(IV) is SO2(aq), HSO3-(aq), and SO32-(aq):
 {O}( aq) + S(IV)( aq) Æ 2H+ + SO42-(unbalanced) (11.12)
In the absence of catalytic species, the reaction with dissolved molecular O2,
 ++ Æ1
22 2 2 4 2O( ) S O( ) HO HS O( )aq aq aq  (11.13)Gaseous Inorganic Air Pollutants 289
is too slow to be signifi  cant. Hydrogen peroxide is an important oxidizing agent in the atmosphere. 
It reacts with dissolved sulfur dioxide through the overall reaction
 SO2(aq) + H2O2(aq) Æ H2SO4(aq) (11.14)
to produce sulfuric acid. The major reaction is thought to be between hydrogen peroxide and HSO3- 
ion with peroxymonosulfurous acid, HOOSO2-, as an intermediate.
Ozone, O3, oxidizes sulfur dioxide in water. The fastest reaction is with sulfi  te ion:
 SO32-(aq) + O3(aq) Æ SO42-(aq) + O2 (11.15) 
Reactions are slower with HSO3-(aq) and SO2(aq) and the rate of oxidation of aqueous SO2 species 
by ozone increases with increasing pH. The oxidation of sulfur dioxide in water droplets is faster 
in the presence of ammonia, which reacts with sulfur dioxide to produce bisulfi  te ion and sulfi  te ion 
in solution:
 NH3 + SO2 + H2O Æ NH4+ + HSO3- (11.16)
Some solutes dissolved in water catalyze the oxidation of aqueous SO2. Both iron(III) and Mn(II) 
have this effect. The reactions catalyzed by these two ions are faster with increasing pH. Dissolved 
nitrogen species, NO2 and HNO2, oxidize aqueous sulfur dioxide in the laboratory. As noted in 
Section 10.10, nitrite dissolved in water droplets may react photochemically to produce an HO∑ radi-
cal, and this species in turn could act to oxidize dissolved sulfi  te.
Heterogeneous reactions on solid particles may also play a role in the removal of sulfur dioxide 
from the atmosphere. In atmospheric photochemical reactions, such particles may function as nucle-
ation centers. Thus, they act as catalysts and grow in size by accumulating reaction products. The 
fi nal result would be the production of an aerosol with a composition unlike that of the original 
particle. Soot particles, which consist of elemental carbon contaminated with polynuclear aromatic 
hydrocarbons (see Chapter 10, Section 10.4) produced in the incomplete combustion of carbona-
ceous fuels, can catalyze the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfate as indicated by the presence of 
sulfate on the soot particles. Soot particles are very common in polluted atmospheres, so it is very 
likely that they are strongly involved in catalyzing the oxidation of sulfur dioxide.
Oxides of metals such as aluminum, calcium, chromium, iron, lead, and vanadium may also be 
catalysts for the heterogenous oxidation of sulfur dioxide. These oxides may also adsorb sulfur 
dioxide. However, the total surface area of oxide particulate matter in the atmosphere is very low, 
so that the fraction of sulfur dioxide oxidized on metal oxide surfaces is relatively small.
11.5.1 E FFECTS  OF ATMOSPHERIC  SULFUR  DIOXIDE
Though not terribly toxic to most people, low levels of sulfur dioxide in air do have some health 
effects. Its primary effect is upon the respiratory tract, producing irritation and increasing airway 
resistance, especially to people with respiratory weaknesses and sensitized asthmatics. Therefore, 
exposure to the gas may increase the effort required to breathe. Mucus secretion is also stimulated 
b y  e x p o s u r e  t o  a i r  c o n t a m i n a t e d  b y  s u l f u r  d i o x i d e .  A l t h o u g h  S O2 causes death in humans at 
500 ppm, it has not been found to harm laboratory animals at 5 ppm.
Sulfur dioxide has been at least partially implicated in several acute incidents of air pollution. In 
December 1930, a thermal inversion trapped waste products from a number of industrial sources in 
the narrow Meuse River Valley of Belgium. Sulfur dioxide levels reached 38 ppm. Approximately 
60 people died in the episode, and some cattle were killed. In October 1948, a similar incident 
caused illness in over 40% of the population of Donora, Pennsylvania, and 20 people died. Sulfur 290 Environmental Chemistry
dioxide concentrations of 2 ppm were recorded. During a 5-day period marked by a temperature 
inversion and fog in London in December 1952, approximately 3500–4000 deaths in excess of 
 normal occurred. Levels of SO2 reached 1.3 ppm. Autopsies revealed irritation of the respiratory 
tract, and high levels of sulfur dioxide in combination with inhaled particles were suspected of 
 contributing to excess mortality.
Atmospheric sulfur dioxide is harmful to plants, some species of which are affected more than 
others. Acute exposure to high levels of the gas kills leaf tissue, a condition called leaf necrosis. 
The edges of the leaves and the areas between the leaf veins show characteristic damage. Chronic 
exposure of plants to sulfur dioxide causes chlorosis, a bleaching or yellowing of the normally green 
portions of the leaf. Plant injury increases with increasing relative humidity. Plants incur most 
injury from sulfur dioxide when their stomata (small openings in plant surface tissue that allow 
interchange of gases with the atmosphere) are open. For most plants, the stomata are open during 
the daylight hours, and most damage from sulfur dioxide occurs then. Long-term, low-level  exposure 
to sulfur dioxide can reduce the yields of grain crops such as wheat or barley. In areas with high

 oxidation of SO2. Such damage appears as small spots where sulfuric acid droplets have impinged 
on leaves.
One of the more costly effects of sulfur dioxide pollution is deterioration of building materials. 
Limestone, marble, and dolomite are calcium and/or magnesium carbonate minerals that are attacked 
by atmospheric sulfur dioxide to form products that are either water-soluble or composed of poorly 
adherent solid crusts on the rock’s surface, adversely affecting the appearance, structural integrity, 
and life of the building. Although both SO2 and NOx attack such stone, chemical analysis of the 
crusts shows predominantly sulfate salts. Dolomite, a calcium/magnesium carbonate mineral, reacts 
with atmospheric sulfur dioxide as follows:
 CaCO3 · MgCO3 + 2SO2 + O2 + 9H2O Æ CaSO4 · 2H2O + MgSO4 · 7H2O + 2CO2  (11.17)
11.5.2 S ULFUR  DIOXIDE  REMOVAL
Several kinds of processes are being used to remove sulfur and sulfur oxides from fuel before 
 combustion and from stack gas after combustion. Most of these efforts concentrate on coal, since it 
is the major source of sulfur oxides pollution. Physical separation techniques may be used to remove 
discrete particles of pyritic sulfur from coal. Chemical methods may also be employed for removing 
sulfur from coal. Fluidized bed combustion  of coal can largely eliminate SO2 emissions at the point 
of combustion. The process consists of burning granular coal in a bed of fi  nely divided  limestone or 
dolomite maintained in a fl  uid-like condition by air injection. Heat calcines the limestone,
 CaCO3 Æ CaO + CO2 (11.18)
and the lime produced absorbs SO2:
 CaO + SO2 Æ CaSO3 (which may be oxidized to CaSO4) (11.19)
Many processes have been proposed or studied for the removal of sulfur dioxide from stack gas. 
These vary by the nature of the adsorbent, the means of contacting fl  ue gas with the adsorbent, 
and whether or not the fi  nal product is dry. Sorbents include CaCO3 (limestone), CaCO3 · MgCO3 
(dolomite), Ca(OH)2 (lime), alkaline fl  y ash from coal combustion, sodium sulfi  te solution, 
sodium carbonate and soda ash, soda liquor waste from production of trona ( a sodium carbonate 
mineral), and magnesium oxide. Flue gas may be contacted with adsorbents by spray processes, 
spray dry processes in which the water in the absorbent solution is evaporated and dry solid residue 
collected, venturi systems, packed beds, bubbling reactors, and trays. Wet processes are the most Gaseous Inorganic Air Pollutants 291
commonly used. Table 11.1 summarizes some stack gas scrubbing systems including throwaway 
and recovery systems.
The wet systems commonly employed to remove sulfur dioxide from fl  ue gas provide a number 
of challenges including scaling, corrosion, general messiness of slurries, and cooling of the gas that 
requires subsequent heating of the gas so that it will rise in the stack. Therefore, dry systems would 
be more desirable, but they have not proven to be particularly effective. A dry throwaway system 
used with only limited success involves the injection of dry limestone or dolomite into the boiler 
followed by recovery of dry lime, sulfi  tes, and sulfates. The overall reaction, shown here for dolo-
mite, is the following:

The solid sulfate and oxide products are removed by electrostatic precipitators or cyclone  separators. 
The process has an effi  ciency of 50% or less for the removal of sulfur oxides.
As seen from the reactions shown in Table 11.1, all wet sulfur dioxide removal processes, except 
for catalytic oxidation, depend upon the absorption of SO2 by reaction with a base. Most scrubbing 
 processes produce a solution of calcium sulfi  te, CaSO3, and solid calcium sulfi  te hemihydrate,

a These processes have also been adapted to produce a gypsum product by oxidation of CaSO3 in the spent scrubber medium: 
CaSO3 + 1
2O2 + 2H2O Æ CaSO4•2H2O(s). Gypsum has some commercial value, such as in the manufacture of plaster-
board, and makes a relatively settleable waste product.292 Environmental Chemistry
Gypsum is the desired fi  nal product and is commonly used to produce wallboard as a commercial 
product (mentioned as an example of the practice of industrial ecology in Section 17.15). Some 
systems blow air into the calcium sulfi  te product to oxidize it to calcium sulfate in a forced oxidation 
system.
Recovery systems in which sulfur dioxide or elemental sulfur are removed from the spent sorb-
ing material, which is recycled, are much more desirable from an environmental viewpoint than are 
throwaway systems. Many kinds of recovery processes have been investigated, including those that 
involve scrubbing with magnesium oxide slurry, sodium hydroxide solution, sodium sulfi  te solution, 
ammonia solution, or sodium citrate solution.
Sulfur dioxide recovered from a stack-gas-scrubbing process can be converted to hydrogen 
 sulfi de by reaction with synthesis gas (H2, CO, CH4)
 SO2 + (H2, CO, CH4) Æ H2S + CO2(H2O) (11.23)
The Claus reaction is then employed to produce elemental sulfur:
 2H2S + SO2 Æ 2H2O + 3S (11.24)
The elemental sulfur product is a commercially valuable material used to make sulfuric acid. The 
recovery of sulfur by this means is a good example of a green chemical process.
11.6 NITROGEN OXIDES IN THE ATMOSPHERE
The three oxides of nitrogen normally encountered in the atmosphere are nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric 
oxide (NO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). In addition, nitrate radical, NO3, is an important species 
involved in the nightime chemistry of photochemical smog (see Section 13.5; this species is not 
important in daytime chemistry because it undergoes photodissociation very rapidly in sunlight). 
The chemistry of nitrogen oxides and other reactive inorganic nitrogen species is very important in 
the atmosphere in areas such as formation of photochemical smog, production of acid rain, and 
depletion of stratospheric ozone.
Nitrous oxide, a commonly used anesthetic known as “laughing gas,” is produced by micro-
biological processes and is a component of the unpolluted atmosphere at a level of approximately 
0.3 ppm (see Table 9.1). This gas is relatively unreactive and probably does not signifi  cantly infl  u-
ence important chemical reactions in the lower atmosphere. Its concentration decreases rapidly with 
altitude in the stratosphere due to the photochemical reaction
 N2O + hn Æ N2 + O (11.25)
and some reaction with singlet atomic oxygen:
 N2O + O Æ N2 + O2 (11.26)
 N2O + O Æ 2NO (11.27)
These reactions are signifi  cant in terms of depletion of the ozone layer. Increased global fi  xation of 
nitrogen, accompanied by increased microbial production of N2O, could contribute to ozone layer 
depletion.
Colorless, odorless nitric oxide (NO) and pungent red-brown nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are very 
important in polluted air. Collectively designated NOx, these gases enter the atmosphere from natu-
ral sources, such as lightning and biological processes, and from pollutant sources. The latter 
are much more signifi  cant because of regionally high NO2 concentrations which can cause severe Gaseous Inorganic Air Pollutants 293
air quality deterioration. Estimates of the quantities of NOx entering the atmosphere vary widely, 
but generally range from a few tens of millions of metric tons per year to somewhat more than 
100 million. The biggest share of anthropogenic NOx amounting to around 20 million metric tons 
per year enters the atmosphere from combustion of fossil fuels in both stationary and mobile sources. 
A similar amount of NOx is emitted from soil, much of it from the action of microorganisms on 
nitrogen fertilizer. Other natural sources are biomass burning, lightning, and, to a lesser extent, 
atmospheric oxidation of NH3. There is a relatively small fl  ux of NOx from the stratosphere to the 
troposphere. The contribution of automobiles to nitric oxide production in the United States has 
become somewhat lower in the last decade as newer automobiles have replaced older models.
Most NOx entering the atmosphere from pollution sources does so as NO generated from internal 
combustion engines. At very high temperatures, the following overall reaction occurs with inter-
mediate steps:
 N2 + O2 Æ 2NO (11.28)
The speed with which this reaction takes place increases steeply with temperature. The equilibrium 
concentration of NO in a mixture of 3% O2 and 75% N2, typical of that which occurs in the combustion 
chamber of an internal combustion engine, is shown as a function of temperature in Figure 11.2. At 
room temperature (27°C) the equilibrium concentration of NO is only 1.1 ¥ 10-10 ppm, whereas at 
high temperatures it is much higher . Therefore, high temperatures favor both a high equilibrium 
concentration and a rapid rate of formation of NO. Rapid cooling of the exhaust gas from combus-
tion “freezes” NO at a relatively high concentration because equilibrium is not maintained. Thus, 
by its very nature, the combustion process both in the internal combustion engine and in furnaces 
produces high levels of NO in the combustion products. The mechanism for the formation of nitro-
gen oxides from N2 and O2 during combustion is a complicated process. Both oxygen and nitrogen 
atoms are formed at the very high combustion temperatures by the reactions
 O2 + M Æ O + O + M (11.29)
 N2 + M Æ N∑ + N∑ + M (11.30)
where M is a third body highly energized by heat that imparts enough energy to the molecular N2 
and O2 to break their chemical bonds. The energies required for these reactions are quite high 
because breakage of the oxygen bond requires 118 kcal/mol and breakage of the nitrogen bond 
requires 225 kcal/mol. Because of its relatively weaker bond, dissociation of O2 predominates over 
FIGURE 11.2 Log of equilibrium NO concentration as a function of temperature in a mixture containing

that of N2. Once formed, O and N atoms participate in the following chain reaction for the formation 
of nitric oxide from nitrogen and oxygen:
 N2 + O Æ NO + N (11.31)
 N + O2 Æ NO + O (11.32)
Leading to the net reaction:
 N2 + O2 Æ 2NO (11.33)
There are, of course, many other species present in the combustion mixture besides those shown. 
The oxygen atoms are especially reactive toward hydrocarbon fragments by reactions such as the 
following: 
 RH + O Æ R∑ + HO∑ (11.34)
where R∑ represents a hydrocarbon fragment of a molecule from which a hydrogen atom has been 
extracted. These fragments compete with N2 for oxygen atoms. It is partly for this reason that the 
formation of NO is appreciably higher at air/fuel ratios exceeding the stoichiometric ratio (lean 
mixture), as shown in Figure 13.3.
The hydroxyl radical itself can participate in the formation of NO. The reaction is 
 N + HO∑ Æ NO + H∑ (11.35)

11.6.1 A TMOSPHERIC  REACTIONS  OF NOx
Atmospheric chemical reactions convert NOx to nitric acid, inorganic nitrate salts, organic nitrates, 
and peroxyacetyl nitrate (see Chapter 13). The principal reactive nitrogen oxide species in the tropo-
sphere are NO, NO2, and HNO3. These species cycle among each other, as shown in Figure 11.3. 
Although NO is the primary form in which NOx is released to the atmosphere, the conversion of NO 
to NO2 is relatively rapid in the troposphere.

Nitrogen dioxide is a very reactive and signifi  cant species in the atmosphere. It absorbs light 
throughout the ultraviolet and visible spectrum penetrating the troposphere. At wavelengths below 
398 nm, photodissociation occurs,
 NO2 + hn Æ NO + O (11.36)
to produce ground state oxygen atoms. Above 430 nm, only excited molecules of NO2 are formed,
 NO2 + hn Æ NO2* (11.37)
whereas at wavelengths between 398 and 430 nm, either process may occur. Photodissociation at these 
wavelengths requires input of rotational energy from rotation of the NO2 molecule. The tendency of 
NO2 to photodissociate is shown clearly by the fact that in direct sunlight the half-life of NO2 is much 
shorter than that of any other common molecular atmospheric species. (The steady-state level of NO2 
may remain relatively high because it rapidly forms again from NO through the action of oxidant-free 
radical species.) The photodissociation of nitrogen dioxide can give rise to the following signifi  cant 
inorganic reactions in addition to a host of atmospheric reactions involving organic species:
 O + O2 + M (third body) Æ O3 + M (11.38)
 NO + O3 Æ NO2 + O2 (11.39)
Thi s  r e a c ti o n  r e s u l t s  in  r a p i d  c o n v e r s i o n  o f  N O  t o  N O2 and during the daytime NO2 is rapidly 
c onverted back to NO by Reaction 11.36. In the absence of photodissociation at night, NO2 predo-
minates over NO.
 NO2 + O3 Æ NO3 + O2 (11.40)
The NO3 product undergoes rapid photodissociation in daytime, but builds up at night. As discussed 
in Chapter 13, NO3 plays a role in atmospheric chemical processes at night, including those involved 
in photochemical smog formation.
 O + NO2 Æ NO + O2 (11.41)
 O + NO2 + M Æ NO3 + M (11.42)
 NO2 + NO3 Æ N2O5 (11.43)
 NO + NO3 Æ 2NO2 (11.44)
 O + NO + M Æ NO2 + M (11.45)
Nitrogen dioxide ultimately is removed from the atmosphere as nitric acid, nitrates, or (in atmo-
spheres where photochemical smog is formed) as organic nitrogen. Dinitrogen pentoxide formed in 
Reaction 11.43 is the anhydride of nitric acid, which it forms by reacting with water:
 N2O5 + H2O Æ 2HNO3 (11.46)
In the stratosphere, nitrogen dioxide reacts with hydroxyl radicals to produce nitric acid:
 HO∑ + NO2 Æ HNO3 (11.47)
In this region, the nitric acid can also be destroyed by hydroxyl radicals,
 HO∑ + HNO3 Æ H2O + NO3 (11.48)296 Environmental Chemistry
or by a photochemical reaction,
 HNO3 + hn Æ HO∑ + NO2 (11.49)
so that HNO3 serves as a temporary sink for NO2 in the stratosphere. Nitric acid produced from NO2 
is removed as precipitation, or reacts with bases (ammonia, particulate lime) to produce particulate 
nitrates.
Reactions of both nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide in power plant plumes are important in the 
environmental fate and transport of NOx and SO2. The presence of water vapor and droplets as well 
as particles may facilitate reactions of NOx and SO2 in plumes.
11.6.2 H ARMFUL  EFFECTS  OF NITROGEN  OXIDES
Nitric oxide, NO, is less toxic than NO2. Like carbon monoxide and nitrite, NO attaches to hemo-
globin and reduces oxygen transport effi  ciency. However, in a polluted atmosphere, the concentra-
ti o n  o f  ni tri c  o xi d e  n o rmall y  i s  m u c h  l o w e r  th an  th a t  o f  c ar bo n  m o n o xi d e  s o  th a t  th e  e ff ec t  o n  
hemoglobin is much less.
Acute exposure to NO2 can be quite harmful to human health. For exposures ranging from sev-
eral minutes to one hour, a level of 50–100 ppm of NO2 causes infl  ammation of lung tissue for a 
period of 6–8 weeks, after which time the subject normally recovers. Exposure of the subject to 
150–200 ppm of NO2 causes bronchiolitis fi  brosa obliterans , a condition fatal within 3–5 weeks 
after exposure. Death generally results within 2–10 days after exposure to 500 ppm or more of NO2. 
“Silo-fi  ll er ’ s  di sease , ”  c a used  b y  N O2 g e n era ted  b y  th e  f erm e n ta ti o n  o f  e ns il a g e  ( m o i s t  c h o pped  
stalks of corn or sorghum used for cattle feed) containing nitrate, is a particularly striking example 
of nitrogen dioxide poisoning. Deaths have resulted from the inhalation of NO2-containing gases 
from burning celluloid and nitrocellulose fi  lm, and from spillage of NO2 oxidant (used with liquid 
hydrazine fuel) from missile rocket motors.
Although extensive damage to plants is observed in areas receiving heavy exposure to NO2, most of 
this damage probably comes from secondary products of nitrogen oxides, such as peroxyacetyl nitrate 
(P AN) formed in smog (see Chapter 14). Exposure of plants to several ppm of NO2 in the laboratory 
causes leaf spotting and break down of plant tissue. Exposure to 10 ppm of NO causes a reversible 
decrease in the rate of photosynthesis. The effect on plants of long-term exposure to a few tenths of a 
ppm of NO2 is less certain. 
Nitrogen oxides are known to cause fading of dyes and inks used in some textiles. This has been 
observed in gas clothes dryers and is due to NOx formed in the dryer fl  ame. Much of the damage 
to materials caused b y N Ox comes from secondary nitrates and nitric acid. For example, stress-
corrosion cracking of springs once widely used in telephone relays occurs far below the yield 
strength of the nickel-brass spring metal because of the action of particulate nitrates and aerosol 
nitric acid formed from NOx.
Concern has been expressed about the possibility that NOx emitted to the atmosphere by super-
sonic transport planes could catalyze the partial destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer that 
absorbs damaging short-wavelength (240–300 nm) ultraviolet radiation. This possibility raised ini-
tial concerns regarding anthropogenic damage to the stratospheric ozone layer around 1970. Detailed 
consideration of this effect is quite complicated, and only the main features are considered here.
In the upper stratosphere and in the mesosphere, molecular oxygen is photodissociated by ultra-
violet light of less than 242-nm wavelength:
 O2 + hn Æ O + O (11.50)
In the presence of energy-absorbing third bodies, the atomic oxygen reacts with molecular oxygen 
to produce ozone:
 O2 + O + M Æ O3 + M (11.51)Gaseous Inorganic Air Pollutants 297
Ozone can be destroyed by reaction with atomic oxygen,
 O3 + O Æ O2 + O2 (11.52)
and its formation can be prevented by recombination of oxygen atoms:
 O + O + M Æ O2 + M (11.53)
Addition of the reaction of nitric oxide with ozone,
 NO + O3 Æ NO2 + O2 (11.54)
to the reaction of nitrogen dioxide with atomic oxygen,
 NO2 + O Æ NO + O2 (11.55)
results in a net reaction for the destruction of ozone:
 O + O3 Æ O2 + O2 (11.56)
Along with NOx, water vapor is also emitted into the atmosphere by aircraft exhausts, which could 
accelerate ozone depletion by the following two reactions:
 O + H2O Æ HO∑ + HO∑ (11.57)
 HO∑ + O3 Æ HOO∑ + O2 (11.58)
However, there are many natural stratospheric buffering reactions, which tend to mitigate the poten-
tial ozone destruction from those reactions outlined above. Atomic oxygen capable of regenerating 
ozone is produced by the photochemical reaction
 NO2 + hn Æ NO + O (l < 420 nm) (11.59)
A competing reaction removing catalytic NO is
 NO + HOO∑ Æ NO2 + HO∑ (11.60)
Current belief is that emissions from even relatively large fl  eets of supersonic aircraft (unlikely in 
light of the 2003 demise of the Concorde aircraft) will not cause nearly as much damage to the 
ozone layer as CFCs.
11.6.3 C ONTROL  OF NITROGEN  OXIDES
As noted in Section 10.9, nitrogen oxides compose a class of the six criteria pollutants regulated by 
the U.S. EPA. Furthermore, they are involved in the formation of tropospheric ozone, O3, another of 
the regulated criteria pollutants. As discussed in Chapter 13, both hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides 
are the required ingredients for the production of ozone and other noxious species in the photo-
chemical smog forming process. Initially, efforts to control such production of ozone were concen-
trated on reducing emissions of volatile organic hydrocarbons. However, in most cases nitrogen 
oxides are the limiting reactants in the production of photochemical smog and ozone so that control 
of nitrogen oxides emissions is very important in reducing tropospheric air pollution.298 Environmental Chemistry
There are two general approaches to the control of NOx emissions. The fi  rst of these is modifi  ca-
tion of combustion conditions to prevent formation of NO and the second is treatment of fl  ue gas to 
remove NOx before it is released to the atmosphere.4
The level of NOx emitted from stationary sources such as power plant furnaces generally falls 
within the range of 50–1000 ppm. NO production is favored both kinetically and thermodynami-
cally by high temperatures and by high excess oxygen concentrations and increases with increasing 
time of exposure to these conditions. Reduction of these three conditions during combustion lowers 
the amount of NO formed. Reduction of fl  ame temperature to prevent NO formation is accom-
plished by adding recirculated exhaust gas, cool air, inert gases, or water, although this decreases 
the effi  ciency of energy conversion as calculated by the Carnot equation (see Chapter 19).
Low-excess-air fi  ring is effective in reducing NOx emissions during the combustion of fossil 
fuels. As the term implies, low-excess-air fi  ring uses the minimum amount of excess air required 
for oxidation of the fuel, so that less oxygen is available for the reaction
 N2 + O2 Æ 2NO (11.61)
in the high-temperature region of the fl  ame. Incomplete fuel burnout with the emission of hydro-
carbons, soot, and CO is an obvious problem with low-excess-air fi  ring. This may be overcome by 
a two-stage combustion process consisting of the following steps:
 1. A fi  rst stage in which the fuel is fi  red at a relatively high temperature with a substoichio-
metric amount of air, for example, 90–95% of the stoichiometric requirement. NO forma-
tion is limited by the absence of excess oxygen.
 2. A second stage in which fuel burnout is completed at a relatively low temperature in excess 
air. The low temperature prevents formation of NO.
In some gas-fi  red power plants, the emission of NO has been reduced by as much as 90% by a two-
stage combustion process.
Removal of NOx from stack gas presents some formidable problems. Possible approaches to NOx 
removal are catalytic decomposition of nitrogen oxides, catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides, and 
sorption of NOx by liquids or solids; sorption is limited by the low water solubility of NO, the pre-
dominant nitrogen oxide species in stack gas.
Commonly used NOx reduction processes use a reducing agent such as methane or ammonia to 
reduce the N oxide to elemental N2 and H2O over a honeycombed catalyst of vanadium and tungsten 
oxides on an alumina (Al2O3) support as shown by the following reaction in which ammonia is the 
reducing agent
 4NH3 + 4NO + O2 Æ 4N2 + 6H2O (11.62)
Denoted as selective catalytic reduction (SCR) the catalytic reduction of NOx is carried out over a 
catalyst at 300–400°C with about 80% effi  ciency. It can also be carried out without a catalyst at a 
much higher temperature of 900–1000°C, but that is only 40–60% effi  cient.
Sorption processes for SO2 removal using bases are relatively ineffective in removing nitric oxide 
because of the low acidity and low water solubility of NO. Proposals have been made for oxidation 
of NO to NO2 and N2O3, which are more effi  ciently absorbed by base. The NO X SO regenerable dry 
sorbent process uses sodium carbonate on high-surface-area alumina beads to absorb SO2 and NOx 
in a fl  uidized bed through which the fl  ue gas is passed. The beads are regenerated to restore their 
sorptive properties.
An interesting possibility for NOx control is the use of biofi  lters .5 A relatively new development in 
air pollution control, biofi  lters employ microorganisms in a fi  xed or fl  uidized bed confi  guration to 
contact gases and absorb pollutants. The microorganisms degrade pollutants retained on the  fi  ltration Gaseous Inorganic Air Pollutants 299
media and produce innocuous products (in the case of sorbed N compounds, N2 is the favored prod-
uct). Ideally, biofi  lters operate at relatively low cost and with low maintenance. However, the chal-
lenge of maintaining a viable biofi  lter in the exhaust stream of a large power plant is daunting.
11.7 ACID RAIN
As discussed in this chapter, much of the sulfur and nitrogen oxides entering the atmosphere are 
converted to sulfuric and nitric acids, respectively. When combined with hydrochloric acid arising 
from hydrogen chloride emissions, these acids cause acidic precipitation (acid rain) that is now a 
major pollution problem in some areas.
Headwater streams and high-altitude lakes are especially susceptible to the effects of acid rain 
and may sustain loss of fi  sh and other aquatic life. Other effects include reductions in forest and crop 
productivity; leaching of nutrient cations and heavy metals from soils, rocks, and the sediments of 
lakes and streams; dissolution of metals such as lead and copper from water distribution pipes; cor-
rosion of exposed metal; and dissolution of the surfaces of limestone buildings and monuments. 
Dissolution of phytotoxic aluminum from soil by acidic precipitation is especially detrimental to 
plant and forest growth.
As a result of its widespread distribution and effects, acid rain is an air pollutant that may pose a 
threat to the global atmosphere. Therefore, it is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 14.
11.8 AMMONIA IN THE ATMOSPHERE
Ammonia, one of the most abundant nitrogen-containing species in the atmosphere, is present even 
in unpolluted air as a result of natural biochemical and chemical processes. Among the various 
sources of atmospheric ammonia are microorganisms in soil, decay of animal wastes, ammonia 
fertilizer, sewage treatment, coke manufacture, ammonia manufacture, and leakage from ammonia-
based refrigeration systems. Livestock and the feedlots in which they are kept are the largest source 
category of ammonia in the United States with production of probably more than a billion kilogram 
per year.6 High concentrations of ammonia gas in the atmosphere are generally indicative of acci-
dental release of the gas.
Ammonia is removed from the atmosphere by its affi  nity for water and by its action as a base; it 
is the major atmospheric base. It is a key species in the formation and neutralization of nitrate and 
sulfate aerosols in polluted atmospheres. Ammonia reacts with these acidic aerosols to form ammo-
nium salts: 
 NH3 + HNO3 Æ NH4NO3 (11.63)
 NH3 + H2SO4 Æ NH4HSO4 (11.64)
Atmospheric ammonia may have a number of effects. Ammonium salts are among the more 
 corrosive salts in atmospheric aerosols. Roughly half of the very small particulate matter (PM2.5) in 
the atmosphere of the eastern United States consists of ammonium sulfate, signifi  cantly affecting 
visibility. Ammonia may affect vegetation with acute exposures causing visible foliar injury.
11.9 FLUORINE, CHLORINE, AND THEIR GASEOUS COMPOUNDS
Fluorine, hydrogen fl  uoride, and other volatile fl  uorides are produced in the manufacture of alumi-
num, and hydrogen fl  uoride is a byproduct in the conversion of fl  uorapatite (rock phosphate) to 
phosphoric acid, superphosphate fertilizers, and other phosphorus products. The wet process for the 
production of phosphoric acid involves the reaction of fl  uorapatite, Ca5F(PO4)3, with sulfuric acid:
 Ca5F(PO4)3 + 5H2SO4 + 10H2O Æ 5CaSO4 · 2H2O + HF + 3H3PO4 (11.65)300 Environmental Chemistry
It is necessary to recover most of the by-product fl  uorine from rock phosphate processing to avoid 
severe pollution problems. Recovery as fl  uorosilicic acid, H2SiF6, is normally practiced.
Hydrogen fl  uoride gas is a dangerous substance that is so corrosive it even reacts with glass. It is 
irritating to body tissues, and the respiratory tract is very sensitive to it. Brief exposure to HF vapors 
at the part-per-thousand level may be fatal. The acute toxicity of F2 is even higher than that of HF. 
Chronic exposure to high levels of fl  uorides causes fl  uorosis, the symptoms of which include  mottled 
teeth and pathological bone conditions.
Plants are particularly susceptible to the effects of gaseous fl  uorides, which appear to enter the leaf 
tissue through the stomata. Fluoride is a cumulative poison in plants, and exposure of sensitive plants 
to even very low levels of fl  uorides for prolonged periods results in damage. Characteristic symptoms 
of fl uoride poisoning are chlorosis (fading of green color due to conditions other than the absence of 
light), edge burn, and tip burn. Conifers (such as pine trees) affl  icted with fl  uoride poisoning may 
have reddish-brown, necrotic needle tips. The sensitivity of some conifers to fl  uoride poisoning is 
illustrated by the fact that fl  uorine produced by aluminum plants in Norway has destroyed forests of 
Pinus sylvestris  up to 8 miles distant; trees were damaged at distances as great as 20 miles.
Silicon tetrafl  uoride gas, SiF4, is another gaseous fl  uoride pollutant produced during some steel 
and metal smelting operations that employ CaF2, fl uorspar. Fluorspar reacts with silicon dioxide 
(sand), releasing SiF4 gas:
 2CaF2 + 3SiO2 Æ 2CaSiO3 + SiF4 (11.66)
Another gaseous fl  uorine compound, sulfur hexafl  uoride, SF6, occurs in the atmosphere at levels of 
about 0.3 parts per trillion. It is extremely unreactive with an atmospheric lifetime estimated at 3200 
years, and is used as an atmospheric tracer. It does not absorb ultraviolet light in either the troposphere 
or the stratosphere, and is probably destroyed above 60 km by reactions beginning with its capture of 
free electrons. Current atmospheric levels of SF6 are signifi  cantly higher than the estimated back-
ground level of 0.04 parts per trillion in 1953 when commercial production of it began. The compound 
is very useful in specialized applications including gas-insulated electrical equipment and inert blan-
keting/degassing of molten aluminum and magnesium. Increasing uses of sulfur hexafl  uoride have 
caused concern because it is the most powerful greenhouse gas known, with a global warming poten-
tial (per molecule added to the atmosphere) about 23,900 times that of carbon dioxide.
11.9.1 C HLORINE  AND HYDROGEN  CHLORIDE
Chlorine gas, Cl2, does not occur as an air pollutant on a large scale but can be quite damaging on 
a local scale. Chlorine was the fi  rst poisonous gas deployed in World War I. It is widely used as a 
manufacturing chemical in the plastics industry, for example, as well as for water treatment and as 
a bleach. Therefore, possibilities for its release exist in a number of locations. Chlorine is quite toxic 
and is a mucous-membrane irritant. It is very reactive and a powerful oxidizing agent. Chlorine 
dissolves in atmospheric water droplets, yielding hydrochloric acid and hypochlorous acid, an 
 oxidizing agent:
 H2O + Cl2 Æ H+ + Cl- + HOCl (11.67)
Spills of chlorine gas have caused fatalities among exposed persons. For example, the rupture of a 
derailed chlorine tank car at Youngstown, Florida, on February 25, 1978, resulted in the death of 
eight people who inhaled the deadly gas, and a total of 89 people were injured. Massive chlorine 
releases from sabotage are a major concern with respect to terrorism.
Hydrogen chloride, HCl, is emitted from a number of sources. Incineration of chlorinated  plastics, 
such as PVC, a polymer of vinyl chloride with an empirical formula of C2H3Cl, releases HCl as a 
combustion product.Gaseous Inorganic Air Pollutants 301
Some compounds released to the atmosphere as air pollutants hydrolyze to form HCl. Accidents 
have occurred in which compounds such as silicon tetrachloride, SiCl4, and aluminum chloride, 
AlCl3, have been released and reacted with atmospheric water vapor:
 SiCl4 + 2H2O Æ SiO2 + 4HCl (11.68)
 AlCl3 + 3H2O Æ Al(OH)3 + 3HCl (11.69)
Hydrogen chloride may be evolved from inorganic chloride salts, such as NaCl, KCl, and CaCl2, 
at high temperatures in the presence of SO2, O2, and H2O by the process of sulfation. The overall 
reaction of sulfation is illustrated below for CaCl2:
 +++Æ +1
22 2 2 4 2 CaCl O SO H O CaSO 2HC1 (11.70)
As discussed in Section 10.11, it is now believed that deliquesced (moist) chloride particles can react 
with hydroxyl radical:
 2NaCl + 2HO∑ Æ 2NaOH + Cl2 (10.14) 
This leaves a basic surface conducive to the retention and oxidation of SO2. Hydrolysis of released 
Cl2 can produce HCl, contributing to acidic material in the atmosphere:
 Cl2 + H2O Æ HCl + HOCl  (11.71) 
11.10 REDUCED SULFUR GASES
Hydrogen sulfi  de, carbonyl sulfi  de (OCS), carbon disulfi  de (CS2), and dimethyl sulfi  de (S(CH3)2) are 
important gaseous compounds in the atmosphere in which the sulfur is in a lower oxidation state. 
These gases are oxidized in the atmosphere to sulfate, in some cases with production of inter-
mediate SO2, and are important sources of atmospheric sulfur.
Hydrogen sulfi  de is produced by microbial processes including the decay of sulfur compounds 
and bacterial reduction of sulfate (see Chapter 6). Hydrogen sulfi  de is also released from geothermal 
steam, from wood pulping, and from a number of miscellaneous natural and anthropogenic sources. 
Approximately 8 ¥ 109 kg (8 Tg) of H2S are released to the global atmosphere annually. Because it 
is so readily oxidized, most atmospheric hydrogen sulfi  de is rapidly converted to SO2. The organic 
homologs of hydrogen sulfi  de, the mercaptans, enter the atmosphere from decaying organic matter 
and have particularly objectionable odors.
Hydrogen sulfi  de pollution from artifi  cial sources is not nearly so widespread as sulfur dioxide 
pollution. However, there have been several acute incidents of hydrogen sulfi  de emissions resulting 
in damage to human health and even fatalities. One of the most notorious such episodes occurred in 
Poza Rica, Mexico, in 1950. Accidental release of hydrogen sulfi  de from a plant used for the recov-
ery of sulfur from natural gas caused the deaths of 22 people and the hospitalization of more than 
300, although some unoffi  cial reports have put the number of fatalities much higher. In December 
2003, a blowout of natural gas contaminated with hydrogen sulfi  de killed 242 people and seriously 
injured more than 2000 in China. As an emergency measure, the gas was set on fi  re, which pro-
duced copious quantities of sulfur dioxide, still an air pollutant, but not nearly so deadly as hydrogen 
sulfi de. Efforts to tap very deep natural gas formations have increased the danger of accidental 
hydrogen sulfi  de release.
Hydrogen sulfi  de in “sour” natural gas has posed an increasing problem as larger amounts of 
relatively abundant sour natural gas are tapped for energy. The problem is especially acute in 
Alberta, Canada, which has some of the world’s most abundant sour natural gas. Recovery of the 302 Environmental Chemistry
hydrogen sulfi  de and conversion to elemental sulfur has caused the supply of sulfur to exceed 
demand. Now, increasing amounts of hydrogen sulfi  de accompani ed b y carbon di o xi de, another 
acidic component of sour natural gas are being injected into underground formations.7
Hydrogen sulfi  de at levels well above ambient concentrations destroys immature plant tissue. 
This type of plant injury is readily distinguished from that due to other phytotoxins. More sensitive 
species are killed by continuous exposure to around 3000 ppb (parts per billion by volume) H2S, 
whereas other species exhibit reduced growth, leaf lesions, and defoliation.
Damage to certain kinds of materials is a very expensive effect of hydrogen sulfi  de pollution. 
Paints containing lead pigments, 2PbCO3 · Pb(OH)2 (no longer used), are particularly susceptible to 
darkening by H2S. Darkening results from exposure over several hours to as little as 50 ppb H2S. 
The lead sulfi  de originally produced by reaction of the lead pigment with hydrogen sulfi  de eventu-
ally may be converted to white lead sulfate by atmospheric oxygen after removal of the source of 
H2S, thus partially reversing the damage.
A black layer of copper sulfi  de forms on copper metal exposed to H2S. Eventually, this layer is 
replaced by a green coating of basic copper sulfate, CuSO4 · 3Cu(OH)2. The green “patina,” as it is 
called, is very resistant to further corrosion. Such layers of corrosion can seriously impair the func-
tion of copper contacts on electrical equipment. Hydrogen sulfi  de also forms a black sulfi  de coating 
on silver.
Carbonyl sulfi  de, OCS, is now recognized as a component of the atmosphere at a tropospheric 
concentration of approximately 500 parts per trillion by volume, corresponding to a global burden 
of about 2.4 Tg. Approximately 1.3 Tg of carbonyl sulfi  de is released to the atmosphere annually . 
About half that amount of carbon disulfi  de, CS2, is released to the atmosphere annually. Carbonyl 
sulfi de has an atmospheric lifetime of approximately 18 months and is the longest-lived of the com-
mon reduced sulfur gases in the atmosphere.
Both OCS and CS2 are oxidized in the atmosphere by reactions initiated by the hydroxyl radical. 
The initial reactions are 
 HO∑ + OCS Æ CO2 + HS∑ (11.72)
 HO∑ + CS2 Æ OCS + HS∑ (11.73)
These reactions with hydroxyl radical initiate oxidation processes that occur through a series of 
atmospheric chemical reactions. The sulfur-containing products that are initially formed as shown 
by Reactions 11.72 and 11.73 undergo further reactions to sulfur dioxide and, eventually, to sulfate 
species. The reaction of carbonyl sulfi  de with hydroxyl radical is so slow that it is probably a minor 
pathway for OCS loss in the troposphere. This gas is metabolized by higher plant carbonic anhydrase, 
which normally metabolizes carbon dioxide, and uptake by higher plants is believed to be a signifi  -
cant sink for carbonyl sulfi  de.
Carbonyl sulfi  de is so long-lived that signifi  cant amounts of it reach the stratosphere. Here it can 
undergo photolysis, leading to the following sequence of reactions:
 OCS + hn Æ CO + S (11.74)
 O + OCS Æ CO + SO (11.75)
 S + O2 Æ SO + O (11.76)
 SO + O2 Æ SO2 + O (11.77)
 SO + NO2 Æ SO2 + NO (11.78)
The sulfur dioxide produced by these reactions is eventually oxidized to sulfate and sulfuric acid 
aerosol. This produces a stratospheric aerosol layer extending from the bottom of the stratosphere Gaseous Inorganic Air Pollutants 303
to an altitude of approximately 30 km. Named after Christian Junge, who discovered it in 1960 
while searching for cosmic dust and debris from nuclear weapons testing, this layer is called the 
Junge layer.

12.1 ORGANIC COMPOUNDS IN THE ATMOSPHERE
Organic pollutants may have a strong effect upon atmospheric quality. The effects of organic pollut-
ants in the atmosphere may be divided into two major categories. The fi  rst consists of direct effects , 
such as cancer caused by exposure to vinyl chloride. The second is the formation of secondary pol-
lutants , especially photochemical smog (discussed in detail in Chapter 13). In the case of pollutant 
hydrocarbons in the atmosphere, the latter is the more important effect. In some localized situa-
tions, particularly the workplace, direct effects of organic air pollutants may be equally important.
This chapter discusses the nature and distribution of organic compounds in the atmosphere. 
Chapter 13 deals with photochemical smog and addresses the mechanisms by which organic com-
pounds undergo photochemical reactions in the atmosphere.
12.1.1 L OSS OF ORGANIC  SUBSTANCES  FROM THE ATMOSPHERE
Organic contaminants are lost from the atmosphere by a number of routes. These include dissolution 
in precipitation (rainwater), dry deposition, photochemical reactions, formation of and incorporation 
into particulate matter, and uptake by plants. Reactions of organic atmospheric contaminants are 
particularly important in determining their manner and rates of loss from the atmosphere. Such reac-
tions are discussed in this chapter.
Forest trees present a large surface area to the atmosphere and are particularly important in fi  lter-
ing organic contaminants from air. Forest trees and plants contact the atmosphere through plant 
cuticle layers, the biopolymer “skin” on the leaves, and needles of the plants. The cuticle layer is 
lipophilic, meaning that it has a particular affi  nity for organic substances, including those in the 
atmosphere. Uptake increases with increasing lipophilicity of the compounds and with increasing 
surface area of the leaves. This phenomenon points to the importance of forests in atmospheric 
purifi  cation and illustrates an important kind of interaction between the atmosphere and the 
biosphere.
12.1.2  GLOBAL  DISTILLATION  AND FRACTIONATION  OF 
PERSISTENT  ORGANIC  POLLUTANTS  (POP)
Persistent organic pollutants (POP), compounds that are resistant to chemical and biochemical deg-
radation, are signifi  cant atmospheric contaminants.1 On a global scale, it is likely that POP undergo 
a cycle of distillation and fractionation in which they are vaporized into the atmosphere in warmer 
regions of the Earth and condense and are deposited in colder regions. The theory of this phenom-
enon holds that the distribution of such pollutants is governed by their physicochemical properties 
and the temperature conditions to which they are exposed. As a result, the least volatile POP are 
deposited near their sources, those of relatively high volatility are distilled into polar regions, and 
those of intermediate volatility are deposited predominantly at mid-latitudes. This phenomenon has 
some important implications regarding the accumulation of POP in environmentally fragile polar 
regions far from industrial sources.308 Environmental Chemistry
12.2 BIOGENIC ORGANIC COMPOUNDS
Biogenic organic compounds  in the atmosphere are those produced by organisms. Biogenic com-
pounds are abundant in the atmosphere of forest regions and are signifi  c an t  p arti c i p an t s  in  th e  
atmospheric chemistry of these regions.2 Natural sources are the most important contributors of 
organics to the atmosphere, and hydrocarbons generated and released by human activities constitute 
only about one-seventh of the total hydrocarbons in the atmosphere. The release to the atmosphere 
of organic compounds by organisms is a very important kind of interaction between the atmosphere 
and the biosphere. Other than methane released primarily by bacteria (see below), the greatest 
source of biogenic organic compounds in the atmosphere is vegetation. Various plants release hydro-
carbons, including isoprene, C10H16 monoterpenes, and C15H24 sesquiterpenes. Oxygenated com-
pounds are released in smaller quantities, but in a great variety, including alcohols, such as methanol 
and 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol; ketones, such as 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one; and hexene derivatives.
The heavy preponderance of biogenic organic compounds in the atmosphere is in large part the 
result of the huge quantities of methane produced by anoxic bacteria in the decomposition of organic 
matter in water, sediments, and soil:
 2{CH2O}(bacterial action) Æ CO2(g) + CH4(g) (12.1)
Flatulent emissions from domesticated animals, arising from bacterial decomposition of food in 
their digestive tracts, add about 85 million metric tons of methane to the atmosphere each year. 
Anoxic conditions in intensively cultivated rice fi  elds produce large amounts of methane, perhaps as 
much as 100 million metric tons per year. Methane is a natural constituent of the atmosphere and is 
present at a level of about 1.8 ppm in the troposphere.
Methane in the troposphere contributes to the photochemical production of carbon monoxide and 
ozone. The photochemical oxidation of methane is a major source of water vapor in the stratosphere.
As the most important natural source o f nonmethane bi ogenic compounds, i t is possi b le that 
vegetation emits thousands of different organic compounds to the atmosphere. Other natural sources 
include microorganisms, forest fi  res, animal wastes, and volcanoes.
One of the simplest organic compounds given off by plants is ethylene, C2H4. This compound is 
produced by a variety of plants and released to the atmosphere in its role as a messenger species 
regulating plant growth. Because of its double bond, ethylene is highly reactive with hydroxyl radi-
cal, HO∑, and with oxidizing species in the atmosphere. Ethylene from vegetation sources is an 
active participant in atmospheric chemical processes. 
Most of the hydrocarbons emitted by plants are terpenes , which constitute a large class of organic 
compounds found in essential oils. Essential oils are obtained when parts of some types of plants are 
subjected to steam distillation. Most of the plants that produce terpenes are conifers (evergreen trees 
and shrubs such as pine and cypress), plants of the genus Myrtus , and trees and shrubs of the genus 
Citrus . One of the most common terpenes emitted by trees is a-pinene, a principal component of 
turpentine. The terpene limonene, found in citrus fruit and pine needles, is encountered in the atmo-
sphere around these sources. Isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene), a hemiterpene, has been identifi  ed in 
the emissions from cottonwood, eucalyptus, oak, sweetgum, and white spruce trees. Linalool is a 
terpene with the chemical formula (CH3)2C=CHCH2CH2C(CH3)(OH)CH =CH2, which is given off by 
some plant species common to Italy and Austria, including the pine Pinuspinea  and orange blossoms. 
Other terpenes that are given off by trees include b-pinene, myrcene, ocimene, and a-terpinene.
As exemplifi  e d  b y  t h e  s t r u c t u r a l  f o r m u l a s  o f  a-pinene, b-pinene, D3-carene, isoprene, and 
limonene, shown in Figure 12.1, terpenes contain alkenyl (olefi  nic ) bonds, in some cases, two or 
more per molecule. Because of these and other structural features, terpenes are among the most 
reactive compounds in the atmosphere. The reaction of terpenes with hydroxyl radical, HO∑, is very 
rapid, and terpenes also react with other oxidizing agents in the atmosphere, particularly ozone, O3, 
and nitrate radical, NO3. Turpentine, a mixture of terpenes, has been widely used in paint because 
it reacts with atmospheric oxygen to form a peroxide, then a hard resin. Terpenes such as a-pinene Organic Air Pollutants 309
and isoprene undergo similar reactions in the atmosphere to form particulate matter. Identifi  ed as 
secondary organic aerosol  (SOA), the resulting Aitken nuclei aerosols (see Chapter 10) are a cause 
of the blue haze in the atmosphere above some heavy growths of vegetation. These SOA particles 
are a large part of atmospheric fi  ne particulate matter, especially in forested areas.3
Sesquiterpenes  consisting of three isoprene units and having the molecular formula C15H24 
 comprise an important class of terpenes. A common example of a sesquiterpene is d-cadinene: 
C CH3
CH3 d-CadineneH3C
H3C H
Laboratory and smog-chamber experiments have been performed in an effort to determine the 
fates of atmospheric terpenes. Oxidation initiated by reaction with NO3 of the four cyclic mono-
terpenes listed above, a-pinene, b-pinene, D3-carene, and limonene, gives products containing 
carbonyl (C =O) functionality and organically bound nitrogen as organic nitrate. When a mixture 
of a-pinene with NO and NO2 in air is irradiated with ultraviolet light, pinonic acid is formed:
H
HH H
H3C
CH3 CH3
HPinonic acid 
HHHHOO 
C C
Found in forest aerosol particles, this compound is produced by photochemical processes acting

In addition to products of reactions with NO3 and hydroxyl radical, a signifi  cant fraction of the

Perhaps the greatest variety of compounds emitted by plants consists of esters . However, they are

12.2.1 R EMOVAL  OF ATMOSPHERIC  ORGANIC  COMPOUNDS  BY PLANTS
In addition to being sources of atmospheric organic compounds as discussed above, plants are also 
repositories of POP thus playing a signifi  cant role in their environmental fate and transport, as noted 
in Section 12.1. The leaves, needles (on pine trees), and stems of higher green plants are covered 
with an epicuticular wax that is organophilic and thus has an affi  nity for organic compounds in air. 
The most important plants in this respect are those in the evergreen boreal coniferous forests in the 
northern temperate zone. The importance of these forests is due to the heavy forestation of the 
northern temperate zone and the high amount of leaf surface per unit area of such forests.
12.3 POLLUTANT HYDROCARBONS
Ethylene and terpenes, which were discussed in the preceding section, are hydrocarbons , organic 
compounds containing only hydrogen and carbon. The major classes of hydrocarbons are alkanes , 
such as 2,2,3-trimethylbutane:
2,2,3-Trimethylbutane H3C

alkenes  (compounds with double bonds between adjacent carbon atoms), such as ethylene, alkynes  
(compounds with triple bonds), such as acetylene: 
HC CHOrganic Air Pollutants 311
and aromatic  (aryl) compounds , such as naphthalene:
Because of their widespread use in fuels, hydrocarbons predominate among organic atmospheric 
pollutants. Petroleum products, primarily gasoline, are the source of most of the anthropogenic 
(originating through human activities) pollutant hydrocarbons found in the atmosphere. Hydro-
carbons may enter the atmosphere either directly or as by-products of the partial combustion of 
other hydrocarbons. The latter are particularly important because they tend to be unsaturated and 
relatively reactive (see Chapter 13 for a discussion of hydrocarbon reactivity in photochemical smog 
formation). Most hydrocarbon pollutant sources produce about 15% reactive hydrocarbons, whereas 
those from incomplete combustion of gasoline are about 45% reactive. The hydrocarbons in uncon-
trolled automobile exhausts are only about 1/3 alkanes, with the remainder divided approximately 
equally between more reactive alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons, thus accounting for the rela-
tively high reactivity of automotive exhaust hydrocarbons.
Alkanes are among the more stable hydrocarbons in the atmosphere. Straight-chain alkanes with 
one to more than 30 carbon atoms, and branched-chain alkanes with six or fewer carbon atoms, are 
commonly present in polluted atmospheres. Because of their high vapor pressures, alkanes with six 
or fewer carbon atoms are normally present as gases, alkanes with 20 or more carbon atoms are 
present as aerosols or sorbed to atmospheric particles, and alkanes with 6–20 carbon atoms per 
molecule may be present either as vapor or particles, depending upon conditions.
In the atmosphere, alkanes (general formula CxH2x+2) are attacked primarily by hydroxyl radical, 
HO∑, resulting in the loss of a hydrogen atom and formation of an alkyl radical :
 CxH∑
2x+1
Subsequent reaction with O2 causes formation of alkylperoxyl radical :
 CxH2x+1O2∑
These radicals may act as oxidants, losing oxygen (usually to NO forming NO2) to produce alkoxyl 
radicals :
 CxH2x+1O∑
As a result of these and subsequent reactions, lower-molecular-mass alkanes are eventually oxidized 
to species that can be precipitated from the atmosphere with particulate matter to ultimately undergo 
biodegradation in soil.
Alkenes enter the atmosphere from a variety of processes, including emissions from internal 
combustion engines and turbines, foundry operations, and petroleum refi  ning. Several alkenes, 
including the ones shown below, are among the top 50 chemicals produced each year, with annual 
worldwide production of several billion kilograms:

These compounds are used primarily as monomers, which are polymerized to create polymers for 
plastics (polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene), synthetic rubber (styrenebutadiene and 
polybutadiene), latex paints (styrenebutadiene), and other applications. All of these compounds, as 
well as others manufactured in lesser quantities, are released into the atmosphere. In addition to the 
direct release of alkenes, these hydrocarbons are commonly produced by the partial combustion and 
“cracking” at high temperatures of alkanes, particularly in the internal combustion engine.

Unlike alkanes, alkenes are highly reactive in the atmosphere, especially in the presence of NOx 
and sunlight. Hydroxyl radical reacts readily with alkenes, adding to the double bond and (rarely) 
by abstracting a hydrogen atom. If hydroxyl radical adds to the double bond in propylene, for exam-
ple, the product is:
•CH H 
H C C HO 
H H H 
Addition of molecular O2 to this radical results in the formation of a peroxyl radical:
H H 
H •O
O 
C C C HO 
H H H 
These radicals then react with HOO∑, alkylperoxyl radicals (ROO∑), or NO, depending upon the 
availability of these species, leading to the formation of aldehydes and other reactive species that 
can participate in reaction chains, such as those discussed for the formation of photochemical smog 
in Chapter 13.
Ozone, O3, adds across double bonds and is rather reactive with alkenes. As shown for the reac-
tion with ozone of the natural alkene limonene in Section 12.2, aldehydes are among the products 
of reactions between alkenes and ozone.
Although the reaction of alkenes with NO3 is much slower than that with HO∑, the much higher 
levels of NO3 relati v e to HO∑, especiall y at ni ght, make i t a si gnifi  cant reactant for atmospheric 
alkenes. (The NO3 radical is present in the atmosphere at appreciable levels only at night because it 
undergoes photolysis very rapidly when exposed to sunlight.) The initial reaction with NO3 is addi-
tion across the alkene double bond which, because NO3 is a free radical species, forms a radical 
species. A typical reaction sequence is the following:

12.3.1 A ROMATIC  HYDROCARBONS
Aromatic (aryl) hydrocarbons  may be divided into the two major classes of those that have only one 
benzene ring and those with multiple rings. As discussed in Chapter 10, the latter are PAH. Aromatic 
hydrocarbons with two rings, such as naphthalene, are intermediate in their behavior. Some typical 
aromatic hydrocarbons are:
Benzene 2,6-DimethylnaphthaleneH3CCH3 
Pyrene
The following aromatic hydrocarbons are among the top 50 chemicals manufactured each year:

Single-ring aromatic compounds are important constituents of gasoline, although the benzene con-
tent of gasoline is restricted because of its possible health effects. Aromatic hydrocarbons are raw 
materials for the manufacture of monomers and plasticizers in polymers. Styrene is a monomer used 
in the manufacture of plastics and synthetic rubber. Cumene is oxidized to produce phenol and ace-
tone, which are valuable by-products. Because of these applications, plus production of these com-
pounds as combustion by-products, aromatic compounds are common atmospheric pollutants. A 
group of single-ring aromatic hydrocarbons that are found as urban air pollutants are those in the 
group known as BTEX consisting of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene.5
Many hydrocarbons containing a single benzene ring and a number of hydrocarbon derivatives 
of naphthalene have been found as atmospheric pollutants. In addition, several compounds contain-
ing two or more unconjugated  rings (not sharing the same p electron cloud between rings) have been 
detected as atmospheric pollutants. These compounds have been detected in tobacco smoke and 
biphenyl has been found in diesel engine smoke.
Biphenyl314 Environmental Chemistry
As discussed in Section 10.8, PAHs are present as aerosols in the atmosphere because of their 
extremely low vapor pressures. These compounds are the most stable forms of hydrocarbons having 
low hydrogen-to-carbon ratios and are formed by the combustion of hydrocarbons under oxygen-
defi cient conditions. The partial combustion of coal, which has a hydrogen-to-carbon ratio <1, is a 
major source of P AH compounds. In addition to being formed in the anthrosphere by incomplete 
combustion of carbonaceous fuels, PAHs are produced and emitted to the atmosphere by grass and 
forest fi  res.6
12.3.2 R EACTIONS  OF ATMOSPHERIC  AROMATIC  HYDROCARBONS
As with most atmospheric hydrocarbons, the most likely reaction of benzene and its derivatives is 
with hydroxyl radical. Addition of HO∑ to the benzene ring results in the formation of an unstable 
radical species,

where the dot denotes an unpaired electron. The electron is not confi  ned to one atom; therefore, it is

the middle. Using this notation for the radical above, its reaction with O2 is

to form stable phenol and reactive hydroperoxyl radical, HOO∑. Alkyl-substituted aromatics may 
undergo reactions involving the alkyl group. For example, abstraction of alkyl H by HO∑ from a 
compound such as p-xylene can result in the formation of a radical

which can react further with O2 to form a peroxyl radical, and then enter chain reactions involved in 
the formation of photochemical smog (Chapter 13).
Although reaction with hydroxyl radical is the most common fate of aromatic compounds dur-
ing daylight, they react with NO3 at night. This oxide of nitrogen is formed by the reaction of 
ozone with NO2:
 NO2 + O3 Æ NO3 + O2 (12.5)
and can remain in the atmosphere for some time as its addition product with NO2:
 NO2 + NO3 + M Æ N2O5 + M (12.6)Organic Air Pollutants 315
12.4 CARBONYL COMPOUNDS: ALDEHYDES AND KETONES
Carbonyl compounds , consisting of aldehydes and ketones that have a carbonyl moiety, C =O, are 
often the fi  rst species formed after unstable reaction intermediates in the photochemical oxidation 
of atmospheric hydrocarbons. Carbonyls are very important in atmospheric chemistry because 
(1) they are formed by the photochemical oxidation of almost all hydrocarbons; (2) they lead to 
production of very reactive and harmful free radicals, ozone, and peroxyacylnitrates; and 
(3) some carbonyls, especially formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein, are toxic mutagens, 
 potential  carcinogens, and eye irritants. The general formulas of aldehydes and ketones are 
 represented by the following, where R and R ¢ represent the hydrocarbon moieties  (portions), such as 
the –CH3 group.

bons beginning with their reactions with hydroxyl radical. For example, formaldehyde is the product

Wi th annual global industrial producti on e x ceeding 1 billi on kg, f ormaldeh y de is used in the 
manufacture of plastics, resins, lacquers, dyes, and explosives. It is uniquely important because of 
its widespread distribution and toxicity. Humans may be exposed to formaldehyde in the manufac-
ture and use of phenol, urea, and melamine resin plastics, and from formaldehyde-containing adhe-
sives in pressed wood products such as particle board, used in especially large quantities in mobile 
home construction. However, signifi  cantly improved manufacturing processes have greatly reduced 
formaldehyde emissions from these synthetic building materials. Formaldehyde occurs in the 
 atmosphere primarily in the gas phase.316 Environmental Chemistry

Acetaldehyde Acrolein Acetone Methylethyl ketone
Acetaldehyde is a widely produced organic chemical used in the manufacture of acetic acid, plas-
tics, and raw materials. Approximately 1 billion kg of acetone are produced each year as a solvent 
and for applications in the rubber, leather, and plastics industries. Methylethyl ketone is employed 
as a low-boiling solvent for coatings and adhesives, and for the synthesis of other chemicals.
In addition to their production from hydrocarbons by photochemical oxidation, carbonyl com-
pounds enter the atmosphere from a large number of sources and processes. These include direct 
emissions from internal combustion engine exhausts, incinerator emissions, spray painting, polymer 
manufacture, printing, petrochemicals manufacture, and lacquer manufacture. Formaldehyde and 
acetaldehyde are produced by microorganisms, and acetaldehyde is emitted by some kinds of 
vegetation.
Aldehydes are second only to NO2 a s  a t m o s p h e ri c  s o u r c e s  o f  f r e e  r a d i c a l s  p r o d u c e d  b y  t h e  
absorption of light. This is because the carbonyl group is a chromophore , a molecular group that 
readily absorbs light. It absorbs well in the near-ultraviolet region of the spectrum. The activated 
compound produced when a photon is absorbed by an aldehyde dissociates into a formyl radical,
HCO • 
and an alkyl radical. The photodissociation of acetaldehyde illustrates this two-step process:

Photolytically excited formaldehyde, CH2O*, may dissociate in two ways. The fi  rst of these 
 produces an H atom and HCO radical; the second produces chemically stable H2 and CO.
As a resul t of their reacti on wi th HO∑ f oll o w ed b y O2 then NO2, aldehydes are precursors to 
the production of strongly oxidizing peroxyacyl nitrates (P ANs ) such as peroxyacetyl nitrate and 
peroxypropionyl nitrate. This process is discussed in Chapter 13, Section 13.5.
Because of the presence of both double bonds and carbonyl groups, alkenyl aldehydes are espe-
cially reactive in the atmosphere. The most common of these found in the atmosphere is acrolein,

a powerful lachrymator (tear producer) used as an industrial chemical and produced as a combus-
tion by-product. The presence of signifi  cant amounts of acrolein in the atmosphere has been attri-
buted to atmospheric reactions operating on 2-furaldehyde, a biomass burning indicator that occurs 
in wood smoke.7
The most abundant atmospheric ketone is acetone, CH3C(O)CH3. About half of the acetone in the 
atmosphere is generated as a product of the atmospheric oxidation of propane, isobutane, isobutene, 
and other hydrocarbons. Most of the remainder comes about equally from direct biogenic emissions 
and biomass burning, with about 3% from direct anthropogenic emissions.Organic Air Pollutants 317

to produce the PAN precursor acetyl radical. It is believed that the mechanism for the removal of the 
higher ketones from the atmosphere involves an initial reaction with HO∑ radical.
Carbonyls are commonly found in ambient air associated with severe incidents of photochemical 
smog formation. For the most part, these compounds are produced as secondary pollutants from the 
photochemical oxidation of hydrocarbons.
12.5 MISCELLANEOUS OXYGEN-CONTAINING COMPOUNDS
Oxygen-containing aldehydes, ketones, and esters in the atmosphere were covered in preceding 
sections. This section discusses the oxygen-containing organic compounds consisting of aliphatic 
alcohols , phenols , ethers , and carboxylic acids . These compounds have the general formulas given 
below, where R and R ¢ represent hydrocarbon moieties, and Ar stands specifi  cally for an aryl 
 moiety, such as the phenyl group (benzene less an H atom):

These classes of compounds include many important organic chemicals.
12.5.1 A LCOHOLS
Of the alcohols, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and ethylene glycol rank among the top 50 chemi-
cals with annual worldwide production of the order of 1 billion kg or more. The most common of 
the many uses of these chemicals is for the manufacture of other chemicals. Methanol is widely used 
in the manufacture of formaldehyde (see Section 12.4) as a solvent, and mixed with water as an 
antifreeze formulation. Ethanol is used as a solvent and as the starting material for the manufacture 
of acetaldehyde, acetic acid, ethyl ether, ethyl chloride, ethyl bromide, and several important esters. 
Both methanol and ethanol can be used as motor vehicle fuels, usually in mixtures with gasoline. 
Ethylene glycol is a common antifreeze compound.
Numerous aliphatic alcohols have been reported in the atmosphere. Because of their volatility, 
the lower alcohols, especially methanol and ethanol, predominate as atmospheric pollutants. Among 
the other alcohols released into the atmosphere are 1-propanol, 2-propanol, propylene glycol, 
1-butanol, and even octadecanol [chemical formula: CH3(CH2)16CH2OH], which is evolved by 
plants. Alcohols can undergo photochemical reactions, beginning with abstraction of hydrogen by 
hydroxyl radical. Mechanisms for scavenging alcohols from the atmosphere are relatively  effi  cient 
because the lower alcohols are quite water soluble and the higher ones have low vapor pressures.
Some alkenyl alcohols have been found in the atmosphere, largely as by-products of combustion. 
Typical of these is 2-buten-1-ol,

which has been detected in automobile exhausts. Some alkenyl alcohols are emitted by plants. One 
of these, cis-3-hexen-1-ol, CH3CH2CH=CHCH2CH2OH, is emitted from grass, trees, and crop 
plants and is known as “leaf alcohol.” In addition to reacting with HO∑ radical, alkenyl radicals react 
strongly with atmospheric ozone, which adds across the double bond.
12.5.2 P HENOLS
Phenols are aromatic alcohols that have an –OH group bonded to an aryl ring. They are more 
noted as water pollutants than as air pollutants. Some typical phenols that have been reported as 
atmospheric contaminants are the following:
OH

OH OHOH CH3 CH3
H3C
Phenol Naphthol o-cresol m-cresol p-cresol
The simplest of these compounds, phenol, is among the top 50 chemicals produced annually. It 
is most commonly used in the manufacture of resins and polymers, such as bakelite, a phenol– 
formaldehyde copolymer. Phenols are produced by the pyrolysis of coal and are major by-products 
of coking. Thus, in local situations involving coal coking and similar operations, phenols can be 
troublesome air pollutants.
12.5.3 E THERS
Ethers are relatively uncommon atmospheric pollutants; however, the fl  ammability hazard of diethyl 
ether vapor in an enclosed work space is well known. In addition to aliphatic ethers, such as  dimethyl 
ether and diethyl ether, several alkenyl ethers, including vinylethyl ether, are produced by internal 
combustion engines. A cyclic ether and important industrial solvent, tetrahydrofuran, occurs as an 
air contaminant. Methyltertiarybutyl ether (MTBE) became the octane booster of choice to replace 
tetraethyllead in gasoline. Because of its widespread distribution, MTBE has the potential to be an 
air pollutant, although its hazard is limited by its low vapor pressure. Largely because of its poten-
tial to contaminate water, MTBE has been largely replaced by ethanol as the oxygenated octane 
booster of choice in gasoline. Another possible air contaminant because of its potential uses as an 
octane booster is diisopropyl ether (DIPE). The structural formulas of the ethers mentioned above 
are given below:

less, fl  ammable, explosive gas used as a chemical intermediate, sterilant, and fumigant. It is a muta-
gen and a carcinogen to experimental animals. It is classifi  ed as hazardous because of both its 
toxicity and ignitability.
12.5.5 C ARBOXYLIC  ACIDS
Carboxylic acids have one or more of the functional group,
CO HO
attached to an alkane, alkene, or aryl hydrocarbon moiety. A carboxylic acid, pinonic acid, produced 
by the photochemical oxidation of naturally produced a-pinene, was discussed in Section 12.2. Many 
of the carboxylic acids found in the atmosphere probably result from the photochemical oxidation of 
other organic compounds through gas-phase reaction s or by reactions of other organic compounds 
dissolved in aqueous aerosols. These acids are often the end products of photochemical oxidation 
because their low vapor pressures and relatively high water solubilities make them susceptible to scav-
enging from the atmosphere, although they are among the most stable organic compounds while in the 
atmosphere. They are removed from the atmosphere by both wet and dry deposition processes.
Low-molecular-mass formic acid, HCOOH, and acetic acid, H3CCOOH, occur in the gas phase 
and partition into aqueous aerosol droplets in fog and clouds, playing a signifi  cant role in the chem-
istry that occurs in these droplets. The heavier organic acids are the most abundant constituents of 
small particles in the urban atmosphere (SOA), examples of which are shown in Figure 12.2.

12.6 ORGANONITROGEN COMPOUNDS
Organonitrogen compounds formed largely by atmospheric chemical processes operating on hydro-
carbons and oxygenated species in the atmosphere are abundant and are involved in the transfer of 
some atmospheric nitrogen to the hydrosphere and geosphere. These compounds in the atmosphere 
may be divided between reduced nitrogen compounds such as amines and oxidized organic com-
pounds such as nitrates. The reduced species are predominantly those emitted directly to the atmo-
sphere whereas the oxidized species are normally produced by oxidizing photochemical processes 
involving HO∑, O3, NOx, and NO3 radical.
Organic nitrogen compounds that may be found as atmospheric contaminants may be classifi  ed 
as amines , amides , nitriles , nitro compounds , or heterocyclic nitrogen compounds . Structural for-
mulas of common examples of each of these fi  ve classes of compounds reported as atmospheric 
contaminants are:
Methylamine Dimethylformamide Acrylonitrile
Aniline Pyridine NitrobenzeneHH
HHH
HC CC CH3C
NO2 NH2H3CO
N

HHHNC
The organonitrogen compounds shown above can come from anthropogenic pollution sources. 
Signifi  cant amounts of anthropogenic atmospheric nitrogen may also come from reactions of 
 inorganic nitrogen with reactive organic species. Examples include nitrates produced by the reac-
tion of atmospheric NO3.
Amines  consist of compounds in which one or more of the hydrogen atoms in NH3 has been 
replaced by a hydrocarbon moiety. Lower-molecular-mass amines are volatile. These are prominent 
among the compounds giving rotten fi  sh their characteristic odor—an obvious reason why air con-
tamination by amines is undesirable. The simplest and most important aryl amine is aniline, used 
in the manufacture of dyes, amides, photographic chemicals, and drugs. A number of amines are 
widely used industrial chemicals and solvents, so industrial sources have the potential to contami-
nate the atmosphere with these chemicals. Decaying organic matter, especially protein wastes, pro-
duce amines, so rendering plants, packing houses, and sewage treatment plants are important 
sources of these substances.
Aromatic amines are of special concern as air pollutants, especially in the workplace, because 
some cause urethral tract cancer (particularly of the bladder) in exposed individuals. Aromatic 
amines are widely used as chemical intermediates, antioxidants, and curing agents in the manufac-
ture of polymers (rubber and plastics), drugs, pesticides, dyes, pigments, and inks. In addition to 
aniline, some aromatic amines of potential concern are the following:
H2N H2N NH2 NH2
NH2Cl
Cl
NH2NH2Benzidine
2-Naphthylamine3,3'-Dichlorobenzidine
1-Phenyl-2-
naphthylamine
1-NaphthylamineOrganic Air Pollutants 321
In the atmosphere, amines can be attacked by hydroxyl radicals and undergo further reactions. 
Amines are bases (electron-pair donors). Therefore, their acid–base chemistry in the atmosphere 
may be important, particularly in the presence of acids in acidic precipitation.
The amide most likely to be encountered as an atmospheric pollutant is dimethylformamide. It is 
widely used commercially as a solvent for the synthetic polymer, polyacrylonitrile (Orlon, Dacron). 
Most amides have relatively low vapor pressures, which limit their entry into the atmosphere.
Nitriles, which are characterized by the –C ∫N group, have been reported as air contaminants, 
p a r t i c u l a r l y  f r o m  i n d u s t r i a l  s o u r c e s .  B o t h  a c r y l o n i t r i l e  a n d  a c e t o n i t r i l e  ( C H3CN) have been 
reported in the atmosphere as a result of synthetic rubber manufacture. As expected from their 
volatilities and levels of industrial production, most of the nitriles reported as atmospheric con-
taminants are low-molecular-mass aliphatic or alkenyl nitriles or aryl nitriles with only one ben-
zene ring. Acrylonitrile, used to make polyacrylonitrile polymer, is the only nitrogen-containing 
organic chemical among the top 50 chemicals with annual worldwide production exceeding 
1 billion kg. 
Among the nitro compounds, RNO2, reported as air contaminants are nitromethane, nitroethane, 
and nitrobenzene. These compounds are produced from industrial sources. Highly oxygenated com-
pounds containing the NO2 group, particularly peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and peroxypropionyl 
nitrate, have no known emission sources and are secondary pollutant end products of the photo-
chemical oxidation of hydrocarbons in urban atmospheres. These compounds are intense eye irri-
tants responsible for much of the disagreeable qualities of photochemical smog. They are mutagens 
and phytotoxins and are suspected of causing skin cancer.

A large number of heterocyclic nitrogen compounds  have been reported in tobacco smoke, and 
it is inferred that many of these compounds can enter the atmosphere from burning vegetation. Coke 
ovens are another major source of these compounds. In addition to the derivatives of pyridine, some 
of the heterocyclic nitrogen compounds are derivatives of pyrrole:

Heterocyclic nitrogen compounds in the atmosphere occur almost entirely in association with 
aerosols.
Nitrosamines , which contain the N–N =O group, and having, therefore, the general formula

deserve special mention as atmospheric contaminants because some are known carcinogens. As 
discussed in Chapter 22, nitrosamines include compounds that can attach alkyl groups to DNA 
resulting in modifi  ed DNA, which can lead to cancer. Both N-nitrosodimethylamine and 
N-nitrosodiethylamine have been detected in the atmosphere.322 Environmental Chemistry
12.7 ORGANOHALIDE COMPOUNDS
Organohalides  consist of halogen-substituted hydrocarbon molecules, each of which contains at 
least one atom of F, Cl, Br, or I. They may be saturated ( alkyl halides ), unsaturated ( alkenyl halides ), 
or aromatic ( aryl halides ). The organohalides of environmental and toxicological concern exhibit a 
wide range of physical and chemical properties. Although most organohalide compounds of pollu-
tion concern are from anthropogenic sources, it is now known that a large variety of such com-
pounds are generated by organisms, particularly those in marine environments.

Dichloromethane  is a volatile liquid with excellent solvent properties for nonpolar organic solutes. 
It has been used as a solvent for the decaffeination of coffee, in paint strippers, as a blowing agent 
in urethane polymer manufacture, and to depress vapor pressure in aerosol formulations. 
Dichlorodifl  uoromethane  is one of the CFC compounds once widely manufactured as a refrigerant 
and involved in stratospheric ozone depletion. One of the more common industrial chlorinated sol-
vents is 1,1,1-trichloroethane .
Viewed as halogen-substituted derivatives of alkenes, the alkenyl  organohalides  contain at least 
one halogen atom and at least one carbon–carbon double bond. The most signifi  cant of these are the 
lighter chlorinated compounds.
Vinyl chloride  is consumed in large quantities as a raw material to manufacture pipe, hose, wrap-
ping, and other products fabricated from polyvinyl chloride plastic. This highly fl  ammable, volatile, 
sweet-smelling gas is known to cause angiosarcoma, a rare form of liver cancer. Trichloroethylene  is 
a clear, colorless, nonfl  ammable, volatile liquid. It is an excellent degreasing and dry-cleaning solvent, 
and has been used as a household solvent and for food extraction (e.g., in decaffeination of coffee). 
Allyl chloride , 3-chloropropene, is an intermediate in the manufacture of allyl alcohol and other allyl 
compounds, including pharmaceuticals, insecticides, and thermosetting varnish and plastic resins.

Aryl halide compounds have many uses. The inevitable result of all these uses has been widespread 
occurrences of human exposure and environmental contamination. PCBs, a group of compounds 
formed by the chlorination of biphenyl,
 xCl2 ++ xHClClx
 (12.12)Organic Air Pollutants 323
have extremely high physical and chemical stabilities and other qualities that led to their being used 
in many applications, including heat transfer fl  uids, hydraulic fl  uids, and dielectrics until their man-
ufacture and use were banned in the 1970s because of their pollution potential.
As expected from their high vapor pressures and volatilities, the lighter organohalide compounds 
are the most likely to be found at detectable levels in the atmosphere. On a global basis, the most 
abundant organochlorine compound in the atmosphere is methyl chloride, CH3Cl, with atmospheric 
concentrations of the order of tenths of a part per billion largely from natural sources in the ocean 
and tropical coastal regions. Methyl chloroform, CH3CCl3, is relatively persistent in the atmosphere, 
with residence times of several years. Therefore, it may pose a threat to the stratospheric ozone layer 
in the same way as CFCs. Among the other lighter organohalides that have been found in the atmo-
sphere are methylene chloride; methyl bromide, CH3Br; bromoform, CHBr3; assorted CFCs; and 
halogen-substituted ethylene compounds such as trichloroethylene, vinyl chloride, perchloroethyl-
ene, (CCl2=CCl2), and solvent ethylene dibromide (CHBr =CHBr).
12.7.1 C HLOROFLUOROCARBONS
CFCs, such as dichlorodifl  uoromethane, commonly called freons, are volatile 1- and 2-carbon com-
pounds that contain Cl and F bonded to carbon. These compounds are notably stable and nontoxic. 
They have been widely used in recent decades in the fabrication of fl  exible and rigid foams and as 
fl uids for refrigeration and air conditioning. Until their uses were banned (see below) the most 
widely manufactured of these compounds were CCl3F  ( C F C - 1 1 ,  b p  2 4 ° C ) ,  C C l2F2(CFC-12, 
bp -28°C), C2Cl3F3 (CFC-113), C2Cl2F4 (CFC-114), and C2ClF5 (CFC-115). 
Halons  are related compounds that contain bromine and are used in fi  re extinguisher systems. 
The major commercial halons are CBrClF2 (halon-1211), CBrF3 (halon-1301), and C2Br2F4 (halon-
2402), where the sequence of numbers denotes the number of carbon, fl  uorine, chlorine, and 
bromine atoms, respectively, per molecule. Halons are particularly effective fi  re extinguishing 
agents because of the way in which they stop combustion. Halons act by chain reactions that 
destroy hydrogen atoms that sustain combustion. The basic sequence of reactions involved is 
outlined below:
 CBrClF2 + H∑ Æ CClF2∑ + HBr (12.13)
 HBr + H∑ Æ Br∑ + H2 (12.14)
 H∑ + Br∑ Æ HBr  (12.15)
Halons are used in automatic fi  re extinguishing systems, particularly those located in fl  ammable 
solvent storage areas, and in specialty fi  re extinguishers, particularly those on aircraft. Because of 
their potential to destroy stratospheric ozone discussed below, the use of halons in fi  re extinguishers 
was severely curtailed in a ban imposed in developed nations on January 1, 1994. The ban on halons 
has caused concern because of the favorable properties of halons in fi  re extinguishers, particularly 
on aircraft. It is possible that hydrogen-containing analogs of halons may be effective as fi  re extin-
guishers without posing a threat to ozone. 
The nonreactivity of CFC compounds, combined with worldwide production that once reached 
approximately one-half million metric tons per year and deliberate or accidental release to the 
atmosphere, has resulted in CFCs becoming homogeneous components of the global atmosphere. In 
1974, it was convincingly suggested, in a classic work that earned the authors a Nobel Prize, that 
chlorofl  uoromethanes could catalyze the destruction of stratospheric ozone that fi  lters out cancer-
causing ultraviolet radiation from the sun.8 Subsequent data on ozone levels in the stratosphere and 
on increased ultraviolet radiation at earth’s surface showed that the threat to stratospheric ozone posed 324 Environmental Chemistry
by CFCs is real. Although quite inert in the lower atmosphere, CFCs undergo  photodecomposition 
by the action of high-energy ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere, which is energetic enough to 
break their very strong C–Cl bonds through reactions such as 
 Cl2CF2 + hn Æ Cl∑ + ClCF2∑ (12.16)
thereby releasing Cl atoms. The Cl atoms are very reactive species that initiate chain reactions that 
destroy stratospheric ozone as discussed in detail in Section 14.4, “Ozone Layer Destruction.”
The U.S. EPA regulations, imposed in accordance with the 1986 Montreal Protocol on Substances 
that Deplete the Ozone Layer, curtailed the production of CFCs and halocarbons in the United 
States starting from 1989. The substitutes for these halocarbons are hydrogen-containing chloro-
fl uorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrogen-containing fl  uorocarbons (HFCs), and some volatile hydrocar-
bon formulations. These have included CH2FCF3 (HFC-134a, 1,1,1,2-tetrafl  uoroethane, which 
became the standard substitute for CFC-12 in automobile air conditioners and refrigeration equip-
ment), CHCl2CF3 (HCFC-123), CH3CCl2F (HCFC-141b), CHClF2 (HCFC-22), and CH2F2 (HFC-
152a, a fl  ammable material). Because of the more readily broken H–C bonds they contain, these 
compounds are more easily destroyed by atmospheric chemical reactions (particularly with hydroxyl 
radical) before they reach the stratosphere. The HFC compounds are favored as CFC substitutes 
because they contain only fl  uorine and hydrogen bound to carbon so that they cannot generate any 
ozone-destroying chlorine atoms.
Some of the HFC compounds, particularly HFC-134a, have been criticized for their global warm-
ing potential. Among the newer alternatives with much less global warming potential are HFO-
1234yf, chemical formula CF3CF=CH2. Concerned about the global warming potential of HFCs, 
European automakers are developing automobile air conditioning systems that use CO2 as a refrig-
erant fl  uid. Although carbon dioxide contributes to global warming, the incremental effects from 
release of this gas from automobile air conditioners would be minuscule because the quantities used 
in automobile air conditioners would be insignifi  c a n t  c o m p a r e d  t o  e m i s s i o n s  f r o m  f o s s i l  f u e l s

12.7.2  ATMOSPHERIC  REACTIONS  OF HYDROFLUOROCARBONS  
AND HYDROCHLOROFLUOROCARBONS
The atmospheric chemistry of hydrofl  uorocarbons (HFCs) and hydrochlorofl  uorocarbons (HCFCs) 
is important, even though these compounds do not pose much danger to the ozone layer. Of particu-
lar importance is the photooxidation of these compounds and the fates and effects of their photooxi-
dation products. Initial attack on these compounds leading to their eventual destruction can be from 
hydroxyl radical or chlorine atoms.9 HFC 134a, CF3CH2F, reacts as follows with hydroxyl radical in 
the troposphere:
 CF3CH2F + HO∑ Æ CF3CHF∑ + H2O (12.17)
The alkyl radical produced by this reaction forms a peroxy radical with molecular oxygen:
 CF3CHF∑ + O2 + M Æ CF3CHFO2∑ + M (12.18)
and the peroxy radical reacts with NO:
 CF3CHFO2∑ + NO Æ CF3CHFO∑ + NO2 (12.19)Organic Air Pollutants 325
The product of that reaction can either decompose:
 CF3CHFO∑ Æ CF3∑ + HC(O)F (12.20)
or react with molecular O2:
 CF3CHFO∑ + O2 Æ CF3C(O)F + HO2∑ (12.21)
These latter two processes are thought to occur to about equal extents. Ultimately, products are 
formed that are purged from the atmosphere.
12.7.3 P ERFLUOROCARBONS
Perfl  uorocarbons  are completely fl  uorinated organic compounds, the simplest examples of which 
are carbon tetrafl  uoride (CF4) and hexafl  uoroethane (C2F6). Several hundred metric tons of these 
compounds are produced annually as etching agents in the electronics industry. However, about 
30,000 metric tons of CF4 and about 10% that amount of C2F6 are emitted to the global atmosphere 
each year from aluminum production. 
Nontoxic perfl  uorocarbons do not react with hydroxyl radical, ozone, or other reactive substances 
in the atmosphere, and the only known signifi  cant mechanism by which they are destroyed in the 
atmosphere is photolysis by radiation less than 130 nm in wavelength. Because of their extreme lack 
of reactivity, they are involved in neither photochemical smog formation nor ozone layer depletion. 
As a result of this stability, perfl  uorocarbons are very long lived in the atmosphere; the lifetime of 
CF4 is estimated to be an astoundingly long 50,000 years! The major atmospheric concern with 
these compounds is their potential to cause greenhouse warming (see Chapter 14). Taking into 
account their nonreactivity and ability to absorb infrared radiation, perfl  uorocarbons have a poten-
ti al to ca use gl o b al w armin g o v er a v ery l o n g time s p an wi th an a ggre g ate e ff ec t per m o l ec ul e 
 several thousand times that of carbon dioxide.
12.7.4 M ARINE SOURCES  OF ORGANOHALOGEN  COMPOUNDS
The predominant natural source of volatile atmospheric organohalogens is from marine organisms. 
This is not surprising considering the high concentrations of chloride ion and lesser levels of 
 bromide and iodide in seawater. Various marine algae are major sources of atmospheric 
organohalogens.
12.7.5 C HLORINATED  DIBENZO -P-DIOXINS  AND DIBENZOFURANS
Polychlorinated dibenzo- p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) are pol-
lutant compounds with the general formulas shown below:
(Cl)1-8 (Cl)1-8

PCDFs PCDDs TCDD, a PCDD326 Environmental Chemistry
As discussed in Chapters 7 and 24, these compounds are of considerable concern because of their 
toxicities. One of the more infamous environmental pollutant chemicals is 2,3,7,8-TCDD, often 
known simply as “dioxin.”
PCDDs and PCDFs enter the air from numerous sources, including automobile engines, waste 
incinerators, and steel and other metal production. A particularly important source may well be 
municipal solid waste incinerators. The formation of PCDDs and PCDFs in such incinerators results 
in part because of the presence of both chlorine (such as from PVC plastic in municipal waste) 
and catalytic metals. Furthermore, PCDDs and PCDFs are produced by de novo  synthesis on 
 carbonaceous fl  y ash surfaces in the postcombustion region of an incinerator at relatively low tem-
peratures of around 300°C in the presence of oxygen and sources of chlorine and hydrogen. 
Atmospheric levels of PCDDs and PCDFs are quite low, in the range of 0.4–100 pg/m3 of air. 
Because of their lower volatilities, the more highly chlorinated congeners of these compounds tend 
to occur in atmospheric particulate matter, in which they are relatively protected from photolysis 
and reaction with hydroxyl radical, which are the two main mechanisms by which PCDDs and 
PCDFs are eliminated from the atmosphere. Furthermore, the less highly chlorinated congeners 
are more reactive because of their C–H bonds, which are susceptible to attack from hydroxyl 
radical.
12.8 ORGANOSULFUR COMPOUNDS
Substitution of alkyl or aryl hydrocarbon groups such as phenyl and methyl for H on hydrogen sul-
fi de, H2S, leads to a number of different organosulfurthiols (mercaptans, R–SH) and sulfi  des, also 
called thioethers (R–S–R). Structural formulas of examples of these compounds are shown below.

The most signifi  cant atmospheric organosulfur compound is dimethylsulfi  de, produced in large 
quantities by marine organisms and introducing quantities of sulfur to the atmosphere comparable 
in magnitude to those introduced from pollution sources. Its oxidation produces most of the SO2 in 
the marine atmosphere.
Methanethiol and other lighter alkyl thiols are fairly common air pollutants that have “ultra-
garlic” odors; both 1- and 2-butanethiol are associated with skunk odor. Gaseous methanethiol 
and volatile liquid ethanethiol are used as odorant leak-detecting additives for natural gas, pro-
pane, and butane, and are also employed as intermediates in pesticide synthesis. Allylmercaptan 
( 2- pro pene- 1 -thi o l ) i s a to xi c , irri tatin g v o l atil e li q ui d wi th a s tro n g g ar li c od or . B enzene thi o l  
(phenyl mercaptan) is the simplest of the aryl thiols. It is a toxic liquid with a severely “repulsive” 
odor.
Alkyl sulfi  des or thioethers contain the C–S–C functional group. The lightest of these com-
pounds is dimethyl sulfi  de, a volatile liquid (bp 38°C) that is moderately toxic by ingestion. Cyclic 
sulfi des contain the C–S–C group in a ring structure. The most common of these compounds is 
thiophene, a heat-stable liquid (bp 84°C) with a solvent action much like that of benzene that is used 
in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, dyes, and resins.Organic Air Pollutants 327
Although not highly signifi  cant as atmospheric contaminants on a large scale, organic sulfur 
compounds can cause local air pollution problems because of their bad odors. Major sources of 
organosulfur compounds in the atmosphere include microbial degradation, wood pulping, volatile 
matter evolved from plants, animal wastes, packing house and rendering plant wastes, starch manu-
facture, sewage treatment, and petroleum refi  ning.
Although the impact of organosulfur compounds on atmospheric chemistry is minimal in 
areas such as aerosol formation or production of acid precipitation components, these compounds 
are the worst of all in producing odor. Therefore, it is important to prevent their release into the 
atmosphere.
As with all hydrogen-containing organic species in the atmosphere, reaction of organosulfur 
compounds with hydroxyl radical is a fi  rst step in their atmospheric photochemical reactions. The 
sulfur from both mercaptans and sulfi  des ends up as SO2. In both cases, there is thought to be a 
readily oxidized SO intermediate, and HS∑ radical may also be an intermediate in the oxidation of 
mercaptans. Another possibility is the addition of O atoms to S, resulting in the formation of free 
radicals as shown below for methyl mercaptan:
 CH3SH + O Æ H3C∑ + HSO∑ (12.22)
The HSO∑ radical is readily oxidized by atmospheric O2 to SO2.
12.9 ORGANIC PARTICULATE MATTER
Organic species are important constituents of atmospheric particulate matter. Some particles con-
s i s t  a l m o s t  e n t i r e l y  o f  o r g a n i c  m a t t e r .  O t h e r s  h a v e  s i g n i fi  cant amounts of organic compounds 
adsorbed to the surfaces of nonorganic material. The visibility-obscuring particles characteristic of 
photochemical smog (Chapter 13) are composed largely of oxygenated organic material that is the 
end product of the photochemical smog process. Pa rticles of elemental carbon and of highly con-
densed PAHs produced as products of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons from sources such 
as diesel engines have a strong affi  nity for organic vapors in the atmosphere.
Organic particulate matter may be emitted directly from sources as primary pollutants or formed 
as secondary pollutants produced by atmospheric chemical processes operating on organic vapors. 
Through the action of reactive atmospheric species, especially HO∑ radical, O3, NOx, and NO3 radi-
cal, oxygen and nitrogen are added to vaporous organic molecules producing much less volatile 
species that condense and form particles.
12.10 HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANT ORGANIC COMPOUNDS
Hazardous air pollutants  were designated in the U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970 as those likely to cause 
adverse health effects. These substances are generally regarded as ones that may come from specifi  c 
sources, such as release from a particular factory, as distinguished from criteria air pollutants , such 
as SO2 and NOx, that are widespread and from a number of sources. The Clean Air Amendments of 
1990 specifi  ed a list of hazardous air pollutants, which has been modifi  ed slightly since then. 
Table 12.1 lists organic compounds, most of which are on the list of hazardous air pollutants (several 
have been delisted since the original publication was published). Most of the substances in the list 
of hazardous air pollutants are organic compounds produced industrially. Although space does not 
permit a discussion of these substances, the CAS number given for each compound will enable the 
reader to look up its formula, properties, and literature related to atmospheric pollution on databases 
such as SciFinder.328 Environmental Chemistry

13.1 INTRODUCTION
This chapter discusses the oxidizing smog or photochemical smog that permeates atmospheres in 
Los Angeles, Mexico City, Zurich, and many other urban areas. Although smog is the term used in 
this book to denote a photochemically oxidizing atmosphere, the word originally was used to 
describe the unpleasant combination of smoke and fog laced with sulfur dioxide which was formerly 
prevalent in London when high-sulfur coal was the primary fuel used in that city. This mixture is 
characterized by the presence of sulfur dioxide, a reducing compound; therefore it is a reducing 
smog or sulfurous smog . In fact, sulfur dioxide is readily oxidized and has a short lifetime in an 
atmosphere where oxidizing photochemical smog is present.
Smog has a long history. Exploring what is now southern California in 1542, Juan Rodriguez 
Cabrillo named San Pedro Bay “The Bay of Smokes” because of the heavy haze that covered the 
area. Complaints of eye irritation from anthropogenically polluted air in Los Angeles were recorded 
as far back as 1868. Characterized by reduced visibility, eye irritation, cracking of rubber, and 
 deterioration of materials, smog became a serious nuisance in the Los Angeles area during the 
1940s. It is now recognized as a major air pollution problem in many areas of the world.
Smoggy conditions are manifested by moderate to severe eye irritation or visibility below 3 miles 
when the relative humidity is below 60%. The formation of oxidants in the air, particularly ozone, is 
indicative of smog formation. Serious levels of photochemical smog may be assumed to be present 
when the oxidant level exceeds 0.15 ppm for more than 1 h. The three ingredients required to generate 
photochemical smog are ultraviolet light, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides. Advanced techniques of 
analysis have shown a large variety of hydrocarbon precursors to smog formation in the atmosphere.
The importance of ozone as an atmospheric pollutant in atmospheres contaminated with photo-
chemical smog have been recognized by changing regulations to lower allowable ozone concentra-
tions in the United States. Allowable ozone levels were further reduced in 2008.
From the time it was recognized as a signifi  cant air pollution problem in the 1940s, the photochemi-
cal smog problem has been the subject of intense studies by chemists, efforts that were largely respon-
sible for the evolution of the discipline of atmospheric chemistry. Much of the progress made in this 
area was due to advances in the study of chemical kinetics in the gas phase, the power of computers 
to make complex calculations, and advances in instrumentation to measure low levels of chemical 
species in polluted atmospheres. This chapter discusses the chemistry of photochemical smog.
Photochemical smog forms in the troposphere and is very much infl  uenced by tropospheric con-
ditions. The troposphere can be viewed as being divided into two major regions. The lowest layer, 
typically around 1 km thick, contains the planetary boundary layer in which there is maximum 
interaction between tropospheric air and Earth’s surface. It is the region in which temperature inver-
sions (see Figure 9.7) form and hold smog-forming chemicals with minimal mixing and dispersion 
so that they can interact with sunlight and each other to produce smog. Above this lower layer and 
extending up to the tropopause where the stratosphere begins is the  free troposphere .
In August 2003, Europe experienced a devastating heat wave that killed thousands of people. In 
addition to the intense heat, the incident was characterized by a stagnant boundary layer, strong 
emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides from the anthrosphere, and widespread forest fi  res 334 Environmental Chemistry
that pumped large quantities of smog-forming emissions into the atmosphere. The result was a long 
period of photochemical smog formation adding to the misery caused by the prolonged period of 
high temperatures.1
13.2 SMOG-FORMING EMISSIONS
Internal combustion engines used in automobiles and trucks produce reactive hydrocarbons and 
nitrogen oxides, two of the three key ingredients required for smog to form. Therefore, automotive 
air emissions are discussed next. 
The production of nitrogen oxides was discussed in Section 11.6. At the high temperature and pres-
sure conditions in an internal combustion engine, products of incompletely burned gasoline undergo 
chemical reactions, which produce several hundred different hydrocarbons. Many of these are highly 
reactive in forming photochemical smog. As shown in Figure 13.1, the automobile has several poten-
tial sources of hydrocarbon emissions other than the exhaust. The fi  rst of these to be controlled was 
the mist of hydrocarbons composed of lubricating oil and “blowby” emanating from the engine crank-
case. The latter consists of exhaust gas and unoxidized fuel/air mixture that enters the crankcase from 
the combustion chambers around the pistons. This mist is destroyed by recirculating it through the 
engine intake manifold by way of the positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) valve.
A second major source of automotive hydrocarbon emissions is the fuel system, from which 
hydrocarbons are emitted from the fuel tank and vents on carburetors, which used to be the primary 
means of introducing fuel/air mixtures into automobile engines. When the engine is shut off and the 
engine heat warms up the fuel system, gasoline may be evaporated and emitted to the atmosphere. 
In addition, heating during the daytime and cooling at night causes the fuel tank to breathe and emit 
gasoline fumes. Such emissions are reduced by fuel formulated to reduce volatility. Automobiles are 
equipped with canisters of carbon, which collect evaporated fuel from the fuel tank and fuel system, 
to be purged and burned when the engine is operating. Modern automobile engines with fuel injec-
tion systems emit much less hydrocarbon vapor than earlier models equipped with carburetors.
13.2.1 C ONTROL  OF EXHAUST  HYDROCARBONS
In order to understand the production and control of automotive hydrocarbon exhaust products, it is 
helpful to understand the basic principles of the internal combustion engine. As shown in Figure 13.2, 
the four steps involved in one complete cycle of the four-cycle engine used in most vehicles are the 
following:
 1. Intake : Air is drawn into the cylinder through the open intake valve. Gasoline is either 
injected with the intake air or injected separately into the cylinder.
 2. Compression : The combustible mixture is compressed at a ratio of about 7:1. Higher 
 compression ratios favor thermal effi  ciency and complete combustion of hydrocarbons. 
However, higher temperatures, premature combustion (“pinging”), and high production of 
nitrogen oxides also result from higher compression ratios.
FIGURE 13.1  Potential sources of pollutant hydrocarbons from an automobile built in years before auto-
motive air pollutants were controlled.

hydrocarbons produced)Fuel tank
      Exhaust (65% of
hydrocarbons produced)Photochemical Smog 335
 3. Ignition and power stroke : As the fuel–air mixture normally produced by injecting fuel into 
the cylinder is ignited by the spark plug near top-dead-center, a temperature of about 2500°C 
is reached very rapidly at pressures up to 40 atm. As the gas volume increases with downward 
movement of the piston, the temperature decreases in a few milliseconds. This rapid cooling 
“freezes” nitric oxide in the form of NO without allowing it to dissociate to N2 and O2, which 
are thermodynamically favored at the normal temperatures and pressures of the atmosphere.
 4. Exhaust : Exhaust gases consisting largely of N2 and CO2, with traces of CO, NO, hydro-
carbons, and O2, are pushed out through the open exhaust valve, thus completing the cycle.
The primary cause of unburned hydrocarbons in the engine cylinder is wall quench, wherein the 
relatively cool wall in the combustion chamber of the internal combustion engine causes the fl  ame 
to be extinguished within several thousandths of a centimeter from the wall. Part of the remaining 
hydrocarbons may be retained as residual gas in the cylinder, and part may be oxidized in the exhaust 
system. The remainder is emitted to the atmosphere as pollutant hydrocarbons. Engine misfi  re due 
to improper adjustment and deceleration greatly increases the emission of hydrocarbons. Turbine 
engines are not subject to the wall quench phenomenon because their surfaces are always hot.
Several engine design characteristics favor lower exhaust hydrocarbon emissions. Wall quench, 
which is mentioned above, is diminished by design that decreases the combustion chamber surface/
volume ratio through reduction of compression ratio, more nearly spherical combustion chamber 
shape, increased displacement per engine cylinder, and increased ratio of stroke relative to bore.
Spark retard also reduces exhaust hydrocarbon emissions. For optimum engine power and economy, 
the spark should be set to fi  re appreciably before the piston reaches the top of the compression stroke and 
begins the power stroke. Retarding the spark to a point closer to top-dead-center reduces the hydrocar-
bon emissions markedly. One reason for this reduction is that the effective surface/volume ratio of the 
combustion chamber is reduced, thus cutting down on wall quench. Second, when the spark is retarded, 
the combustion products are purged from the cylinders sooner after combustion. Therefore, the exhaust 
gas is hotter, and reactions consuming hydrocarbons are promoted in the exhaust system. 
As shown in Figure 13.3, the air/fuel ratio in the internal combustion engine has a marked effect 
upon the emission of hydrocarbons. As the air/fuel ratio becomes richer in fuel than the stoichio-
metric ratio, the emission of hydrocarbons increases signifi  cantly. There is a moderate decrease in 
hydrocarbon emissions when the mixture becomes appreciably leaner in fuel than the stoichiomet-
ric ratio requires. The lowest level of hydrocarbon emissions occurs at an air/fuel ratio somewhat 
leaner in fuel than the stoichiometric ratio. This behavior is the result of a combination of factors, 
including minimum quench layer thickness at an air/fuel ratio somewhat richer in fuel than the FIGURE 13.2 Steps in one complete cycle of a four-cycle internal combustion engine. Fuel is mixed with the 
intake air or injected separately into each cylinder.

 stoichiometric ratio, decreasing hydrocarbon concentration in the quench layer with a leaner mix-
ture, increasing oxygen concentration in the exhaust with a leaner mixture, and a peak exhaust 
temperature at a ratio slightly leaner in fuel than the stoichiometric ratio.
Catalytic converters are now used to destroy pollutants in exhaust gases. Currently, the most

because a single catalytic unit destroys all three of the main class of automobile exhaust pollut-
ants—hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides. This catalyst depends upon accurate 
sensing of oxygen levels in the exhaust combined with computerized engine control, which cycles 
the air/fuel mixture several times per second back and forth between slightly lean and slightly 
rich relative to the stoichiometric ratio. Under these conditions carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and 
hydrocarbons (CcHh) are oxidized.

Nitrogen oxides are reduced on the catalyst to N2 by carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, or hydrogen

Automotive exhaust catalysts are dispersed on a high surface area substrate, most commonly 
consisting of cordierite, a ceramic composed of alumina (Al2O3), silica, and magnesium oxide. The 
substrate is formed as a honeycomb-type structure providing maximum surface area to contact 
exhaust gases. The support needs to be mechanically strong to withstand vibrational stresses from 
the automobile, and it must resist severe thermal stresses in which the temperature may rise from 
ambient temperatures to approximately 900°C over an approximately 2-min period during “light-
off” when the engine is started. The catalytic material, which composes only about 0.10–0.15% of 
the catalyst body, consists of a mixture of precious metals. Platinum and palladium catalyze the 
oxidation of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, and rhodium acts as a catalyst for the reduction of 
nitrogen oxides; presently, palladium is the most common precious metal in exhaust catalysts.
Since lead can poison auto exhaust catalysts, automobiles equipped with catalytic exhaust- control 
devices require lead-free gasoline, which has now displaced gasoline containing antiknock  tetraethyl FIGURE 13.3 Effects of air/fuel ratio on pollutant emissions from an internal combustion piston engine.

lead, the dominant automobile engine fuel that was standard until the 1970s. Sulfur in gasoline is 
also detrimental to catalyst performance, and the sulfur contents of gasoline and, more recently, 
diesel fuel have been greatly reduced in recent years.
The internal combustion automobile engine has been developed to a remarkably high degree of 
sophistication in terms of its emissions. Increased use of hybrid automobiles combining an 
 internal combustion engine with an electric motor/generator that enable the internal combustion 
engine to run evenly under optimum operating conditions are lowering emissions even further.
The 1990 U.S. Clean Air Act called for reformulating gasoline by adding more oxygenated 
 compounds to reduce emissions of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. However, this measure became 
rather controversial and problems were encountered with one of the major oxygenated  additives, 
MTBE, which was detected as a common water pollutant in some areas. Because of these concerns, 
MTBE has been largely eliminated from gasoline and replaced by ethanol as an oxygenated additive.
Ethanol in gasoline poses some environmental and sustainability problems. Ethanol is regarded 
as a renewable fuel source made by fermentation of sugars, primarily from corn in the United States 
and abundant sugarcane in Brazil. Some studies have suggested that the life cycle of corn-based 
ethanol in gasoline will increase photochemical smog compared to gasoline that is entirely from 
petroleum sources.2 Emissions to the atmosphere of volatile ethanol from fuel that is 85% ethanol 
and 15% gasoline (E85) could contribute to elevated atmospheric levels of photochemically pro-
duced acetaldehyde, a noxious smog component. 
13.2.2 A UTOMOTIVE  EMISSION  STANDARDS
Federal law and California state law mandate automotive emission standards. The allowable emissions 
have been on a downward trend since the fi  rst standards were imposed in the mid-1960s. Table 13.1 
gives Federal emissions prior to controls and those for various time intervals since 1970.

In some areas, biogenic hydrocarbons emitted to the atmosphere by plants are signifi  cant—even domi-
nant—sources of hydrocarbons contributing to smog. The hydrocarbons from plants that contribute the

most to smog formation are terpenes, highly reactive alkenes. Some of the most common biogenic ter-
penes are shown in Figure 12.1. These compounds include a-pinene from pine trees and limonene from 
citrus trees. The most widely emitted terpene from plants is isoprene,3 a monomer in natural rubber:

A signifi  cant product of the atmospheric oxidation of isoprene consists of isoprene nitrates, which

oxides and by reaction of isoprene with nitrate radical, NO3.4
13.3  SMOG-FORMING REACTIONS OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS IN 
THE ATMOSPHERE
Hydrocarbons are eliminated from the atmosphere by a number of chemical and photochemical 
reactions. These reactions are responsible for th e formation of many noxious secondary pollutant 
products and intermediates from relatively innocuous hydrocarbon precursors. These pollutant 
 products and intermediates make up photochemical smog.
Hydrocarbons and most other organic compounds in the atmosphere are thermodynamically 
unstable toward oxidation and tend to be oxidized through a series of steps. The oxidation process 
terminates with the formation of CO2, solid organic particulate matter which settles from the atmo-
sphere, or water-soluble products (e.g., acids, aldehydes) which are removed by rain. Inorganic 
 species such as ozone or nitric acid are byproducts of these reactions.
13.3.1 P HOTOCHEMICAL  REACTIONS  OF METHANE
Some of the major reactions involved in the oxidation of atmospheric hydrocarbons may be 
 understood by considering the oxidation of methane, the most common and widely dispersed atmo-
spheric hydrocarbon (though also the least reactive in the atmosphere). Like other hydro carbons, 
methane reacts with oxygen atoms (generally produced by the photochemical dissociation of NO2 
to O and NO) to generate the all-important hydroxyl radical and an alkyl (methyl) radical
 CH4 + O  Æ  H3C ∑ + HO ∑  (13.5)
The methyl radical produced reacts rapidly with molecular oxygen to form very reactive peroxyl 
radicals,
 H3C ∑ + O2 + M (energy-absorbing third body, usually a molecule of N2 or O2)  Æ  H3COO ∑ + M  
 (13.6)
in this case, methyl peroxyl radical, H3COO∑. Such radicals participate in a variety of subsequent 
chain reactions, including those leading to smog formation. The hydroxyl radical reacts rapidly with 
hydrocarbons to form reactive hydrocarbon radicals,Photochemical Smog 339
 CH4 + HO∑  Æ  H3C∑ + H2O (13.7)
in this case, the methyl radical, H3C∑. The following are more reactions involved in the overall 
 oxidation of methane:

(This is a very important kind of reaction in smog formation because the oxidation of NO by peroxyl 
radicals is the predominant means of regenerating NO2 in the atmosphere after it has been photo-
chemically dissociated to NO.)

As noted throughout this chapter, hydroxyl radical, HO∑, and hydroperoxyl radical, HOO∑, are 
ubiquitous intermediates in photochemical chain-reaction processes. These two species are known 
collectively as odd hydrogen radicals . 
Reactions such as 13.5 and 13.7 are abstraction reactions  involving the removal of an atom, 
 usually hydrogen, by reaction with an active species. Addition reactions of organic compounds are 
also common. Typically, hydroxyl radical reacts with an alkene such as propylene to form another 
reactive free radical:

Organic compounds (in the troposphere, almost exclusively carbonyls) can undergo primary 
photochemical reactions resulting in the direct formation of free radicals. By far the most important 
of these is the photochemical dissociation of aldehydes:

leaving an aldehyde or ketone. The hydroxyl radical may react with other organic compounds, 
maintaining the chain reaction. Gas-phase reaction chains commonly have many steps. Furthermore, 
chain-branching reactions take place in which a free radical reacts with an excited molecule causing 
it to produce two new radicals. Chain termination may occur in several ways, including reaction of 
two free radicals,

adduct formation with nitric oxide or nitrogen dioxide (which, because of their odd numbers of 
electrons, are themselves stable free radicals),
 HO∑ + NO2 + M Æ HNO3 + M (13.18)
or reaction of the radical with a solid particle surface.
Hydrocarbons may undergo heterogeneous reactions on particles in the atmosphere. Dusts com-
posed of metal oxides or charcoal have a catalytic effect upon the oxidation of organic compounds. 
Metal oxides may enter into photochemical reactions. For example, zinc oxide photosensitized by 
exposure to light promotes oxidation of organic compounds.
The kinds of reactions just discussed are involved in the formation of photochemical smog in 
the atmosphere. Much of what is known about the reactions that take place in a smog-forming 
 atmosphere has been learned from studies in large chambers containing a stationary mass of air that 
is subjected to conditions conducive to the formation of photochemical smog including exposure to 
ultraviolet radiation, low humidity, and presence of reactive hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides.5 
Next, consideration is given to the smog-forming process.
13.4 OVERVIEW OF SMOG FORMATION
This section addresses the conditions that are characteristic of a smoggy atmosphere and the  overall pro-
cesses involved in smog formation. In atmospheres that receive hydrocarbon and NO pollution accom-
panied by intense sunlight and stagnant air masses, oxidants tend to form. In air-pollution parlance, 
gross photochemical oxidant is a substance in the atmosphere capable of oxi dizing iodide ion to ele-
mental iodine. Sometimes other reducing agents are used to measure oxidants. The  primary oxidant 
in the atmosphere is ozone. Other atmospheric oxidants include H2O2, organic peroxides (ROOR ¢), 
organic hydroperoxides (ROOH), and peroxyacyl nitrates such as peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN).

Nitrogen dioxide, NO2, is not regarded as a gross photochemical oxidant. However, it is about 
15% as effi  cient as O3 in oxidizing iodide to iodine(0), and a correction is made in measurements for 
the positive interference of NO2. Sulfur dioxide is oxidized by O3 and produces a negative interfer-
ence for which a measurement correction must also be made.

nitrate (PBN),

a powerful eye irritant and lachrymator, are produced photochemically in atmospheres con-
taining  alkenes and NOx. PAN, especially, is a notorious organic oxidant. It has several adverse effects 
including eye irritation, phytotoxicity, and mutagenicity and is perhaps the best single  indicator of Photochemical Smog 341
photochemical smog conditions. In addition to PAN and PBN, some other specifi  c organic oxidants 
that may be important in polluted atmospheres are peroxypropionyl nitrate (PPN); peracetic acid, 
CH3(CO)OOH; acetylperoxide, CH3(CO)OO(CO)CH3; butyl hydroperoxide, CH3CH2CH2CH2OOH; 
and tert-butylhydroperoxide, (CH3)3COOH. Fortunately, levels of PAN, PPN, and other organic oxi-
dants as well have decreased signifi  cantly in smog-prone areas such as southern California from the 
1960s to the present, the result of emission control measures that have been implemented.
As shown in Figure 13.4, smoggy atmospheres show characteristic variations with time of day 
in levels of NO, NO2, hydrocarbons, aldehydes, and oxidants. Examination of the fi  gure shows 
that shortly after sunrise the level of NO in the atmosphere decreases markedly, a decrease that is 
accompanied by a peak in the concentration of NO2. During midday (signifi  cantly, after the concen-
tration of NO has fallen to a very low level), the levels of aldehydes and oxidants become relatively 
high. The concentration of total hydrocarbons in the atmosphere peaks sharply in the morning, then 
decreases during the remaining daylight hours.
An overview of the processes responsible for the behavior just discussed is summarized in 
Figure 13.5. The chemical bases for the processes illustrated in this fi  gure are explained in the 
 following section.
13.5 MECHANISMS OF SMOG FORMATION
Here are discussed some of the primary aspects of photochemical smog formation. For more details 
the reader is referred to books on atmospheric chemistry and atmospheric chemistry and physics 
listed in the Supplementary References at the end of this chapter. Since the exact chemistry of 
 photochemical smog formation is very complex, many of the reactions are given as plausible illu-
strative examples rather than proven mechanisms.
The kind of behavior summarized in Figure 1 3 .4 contains several apparent anomalies, which 
puzzled scientists for many years. The fi  rst of these was the rapid increase in NO2 concentration and 
decrease in NO concentration under conditions where it was known that photodissociation of NO2 
to O and NO was occurring. Furthermore, it could be shown that the disappearance of alkenes and 
other hydrocarbons was much more rapid than could be explained by their relatively slow reactions 
with O3 and O. These anomalies are now explained by chain reactions involving the interconversion 
of NO and NO2, the oxidation of hydrocarbons, and the generation of reactive intermediates, par-
ticularly hydroxyl radical (HO∑).

Figure 13.5 shows the overall reaction scheme for smog formation, which is based upon the 
 photochemically initiated reactions that occur in an atmosphere containing nitrogen oxides, reactive 
hydrocarbons, and oxygen. The time variations in levels of hydrocarbons, ozone, NO, and NO2 are 
explained by the following overall reactions:
 1. Primary photochemical reaction producing oxygen atoms:
 NO2 + hn (l < 394 nm) Æ NO + O (13.19)
 2. Reactions involving oxygen species (M is an energy-absorbing third body):
 O2 + O + M Æ O3 + M (13.20)
 O3 + NO Æ NO2 + O2 (13.21)
  Because the latter reaction is rapid, the concentration of O3 remains low until that of NO 
falls to a low value. Automotive emissions of NO tend to keep O3 concentrations lower 
along freeways.
 3. Production of organic free radicals from hydrocarbons, RH:

  (R∑ is a free radical in which the dot denotes an unpaired electron, which may or may not 
contain oxygen.)
 4. Chain propagation, branching, and termination by a variety of reactions such as the 
following:
 NO + ROO∑ Æ NO2 + and/or other products (13.24)
 NO2 + R∑ Æ products (e.g., PAN) (13.25)
The latter kind of reaction is the most common chain-terminating process in smog because NO2 is 
a stable free radical present at high concentrations. Chains may terminate also by reaction of free 
radicals with NO or by reaction of two R∑ radicals, although the latter is uncommon because of 
the relatively low concentrations of radicals compared to molecular species. Chain termination by 
radical sorption on a particle surface is also possible and may contribute to aerosol particle 
growth.
A large number of specifi  c reactions are involved in the overall scheme for the formation of 
 photochemical smog. The formation of atomic oxygen by a primary photochemical reaction 
(Reaction 13.19) leads to several reactions involving oxygen and nitrogen oxide species:
 O + O2 + M Æ O3 + M (13.26)
 O + NO + M Æ NO2 + M (13.27)
 O + NO2 Æ NO + O2 (13.28)
 O3 + NO Æ NO2 + O2 (13.29)
 O + NO2 + M Æ NO3 + M (13.30)
 O3 + NO2 Æ NO3 + O2 (13.31)
There are a number of signifi  cant atmospheric reactions involving nitrogen oxides, water, nitrous 
acid, and nitric acid:
 NO3 + NO2 Æ N2O5 (13.32)
 N2O5 Æ NO3 + NO2 (13.33)
 NO3 + NO Æ 2NO2 (13.34)
 N2O5 + H2O Æ 2HNO3 (13.35)
(This reaction is slow in the gas phase but may be fast on surfaces.)
Very reactive HO∑ radicals can be formed by the reaction of excited atomic oxygen with water,
 O* + H2O Æ 2HO∑ (13.36)
by photodissociation of hydrogen peroxide,
 H2O2 + hn (l < 350 nm) Æ 2HO∑ (13.37)
or by the photolysis of nitrous acid,
 HNO2 + hn Æ HO∑ + NO (13.38)344 Environmental Chemistry
This reaction may be the main source of hydroxyl radical during early morning hours when sources 
deriving from the presence of ozone are minimal. Among the inorganic species with which the 
hydroxyl radical reacts are oxides of nitrogen,
 HO∑ + NO2 Æ HNO3 (13.39)
 HO∑ + NO + M Æ HNO2 + M (13.40)
and carbon monoxide,
 CO + HO∑ + O2 Æ CO2 + HOO∑ (13.41)
The last reaction is signifi  cant in that it is responsible for the disappearance of much atmospheric 
CO (see Section 11.3) and because it produces the hydroperoxyl radical HOO∑. One of the major 
inorganic reactions of the hydroperoxyl radical is the oxidation of NO:
 HOO∑ + NO Æ HO∑ + NO2 (13.42)
For purely inorganic systems, kinetic calculations and experimental measurements cannot 
explain the rapid transformation of NO to NO2 that occurs in an atmosphere undergoing photo-
chemical smog formation and predict that the concentration of NO2 s h o u l d  r e m a i n  v e r y  l o w .  
Ho w e v er , in the presence of reacti v e h y drocarbons, NO2 accumulates very rapidly by a reaction 
process beginning with its photodissociation! It may be concluded, therefore, that the organic com-
pounds form species that react with NO directly rather than with NO2.
A number of chain reactions have been shown to result in the general type of species behavior 
with time shown in Figure 13.4. When alkane hydrocarbons, RH, react with O, O3, or HO∑ 
radical,
 RH + O + O2 Æ ROO∑ + HO∑ (13.43)
 RH + HO∑ + O2 Æ ROO∑ + H2O (13.44)
reactive oxygenated organic radicals, ROO∑, are produced. Alkenes are much more reactive, under-
going primarily addition reactions with hydroxyl radical,

Aromatic hydrocarbons, Ar-H, may also react with O and HO∑. Addition reactions of aromatics with 
HO∑ are favored. The product of the reaction of benzene with HO∑ is phenol, as shown by the fol-
lowing reaction sequence in which the half-circle and dot inside the hexagon structure represents a 
free radical formed by adding HO∑ to the aromatic ring:

Hydroxyl radical (HO∑), which reacts with some hy drocarbons at rates that are almost diffusion-
controlled, is the predominant reactant in early stages of smog formation. Signifi  cant contributions are 
made by hydroperoxyl radical (HOO∑), O3, and (at night) NO3 after smog formation is well underway.
One of the most important reaction sequences in the smog-formation process begins with the 
abstraction by HO∑ of a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon and leads to the oxidation of NO to NO2 
as follows:
 RH + HO∑ Æ R∑ + H2O (13.54)
The alkyl radical, R∑, reacts with O2 to produce a peroxyl radical, ROO∑:
 R∑ + O2 Æ ROO∑ (13.55)
This strongly oxidizing species very effectively oxidizes NO to NO2,
 ROO∑ + NO Æ RO∑ + NO2 (13.56)
thus explaining the once-puzzling rapid conversion of NO to NO2 in an atmosphere in which the 
latter is undergoing photodissociation. The alkoxyl radical product, RO∑, is not so stable as ROO∑. 346 Environmental Chemistry
In cases where the oxygen atom is attached to a carbon atom that is also bonded to H, a carbonyl 
compound is likely to be formed by the following type of reaction:
 O
+ + H3CO• O2 HH HOO • C (13.57)
The rapid production of photosensitive carbonyl compounds from alkoxyl radicals is an important 
stimulant for further atmospheric photochemical reactions. In the absence of extractable hydrogen, 
cleavage of a radical containing the carbonyl group occurs:
 O
+ O• C CO2H3C H3C• (13.58)
Carbonyl compounds, which are discussed in more detail in Section 12.4, are important initia-
tors, intermediates and end products of smog formation. More than 50 carbonyls may be present in 
highly polluted air. The most abundant carbonyls in the polluted urban atmosphere are usually 
 formaldehyde and acetaldehyde; acetone is usually the most abundant ketone. 
The oxidation of NO to NO2 in the atmosphere was noted above. Another reaction that can lead 
to the oxidation of NO is of the following type:
 O
OO• ROO • R C + + ++ NO O2 NO2 CO2 (13.59)
Peroxyacyl nitrates are formed by an addition reaction with NO2:
 O O
R + OO OO• NO2 NO2C C R (13.60)
When R is the methyl group, the product is PAN, mentioned in Section 13.4. Although it is ther-
mally unstable, PAN does not undergo photolysis rapidly, reacts only slowly with HO∑ radical, and 
has a low water solubility. Therefore, the major pathway by which it is lost from the atmosphere is 
thermal decomposition, the reverse of Reaction 13.60.
Peroxyacyl nitrates are highly signifi  cant air pollutants that are symptomatic of photochemical 
smog. These compounds are eye irritants and mutagens. As potent phytotoxins, they are damaging 
to plants and they are agents for the atmospheric transport of reactive nitrogen. There is concern that 
the increasing use of ethanol as a gasoline antiknock additive will increase levels of PAN. This is 
because ethanol is photochemically oxidized to acetaldehyde, the photochemical oxidation of which 
leads to the formation of PAN.6
Alkyl nitrates and alkyl nitrites may be formed by the reaction of alkoxyl radicals (RO∑) with 
nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide, respectively:
 RO∑ + NO2 Æ RONO2 (13.61)
 RO∑ + NO Æ RONO (13.62)
Addition reactions with NO2 and NO such as those shown in Reactions 13.61 and 13.62 are impor-
tant in terminating the reaction chains involved in smog formation. The fact that NO2 is involved in 
a chain termination step (Reaction 13.61) as well as a chain initiation step (Reaction 13.19) may limit 
the effectiveness of moderate reductions in NOx emissions in curtailing smog formation. Nitrates 
and peroxynitrates are important constituents of smoggy atmospheres.
As shown in Reaction 13.57, the reaction of oxygen with alkoxyl radicals produces hydroperoxyl 
radical. Peroxyl radicals can react with one another to produce reactive hydrogen peroxide, alkoxyl 
radicals, and hydroxyl radicals:
 HOO∑ + HOO∑ Æ H2O2 + O2 (13.63)Photochemical Smog 347
 HOO∑ + ROO∑ Æ RO∑ + HO∑ + O2 (13.64)
 ROO∑ + ROO∑ Æ 2RO∑ + O2 (13.65)
13.5.1  NITRATE  RADICAL
First observed in the troposphere in 1980, nitrate radical, NO3, is now recognized as being an impor-
tant atmospheric chemical species, especially at night. This species is formed by the reaction
 NO2 + O3 Æ NO3 + O2 (13.66)
and exists in equilibrium with NO2:
 ++ + /arrowpairrightleft23 2 5NO NO M N O M (energy-absorbing third body) (13.67)
Levels of NO3 remain low during daylight, typically with a lifetime at noon of only about 5 s, 
because of the following two dissociation reactions:
 NO3 + hn (l < 700 nm) Æ NO + O2 (13.68)
 NO3 + hn (l < 580 nm) Æ NO2 + O (13.69)
It is likely that NO3 levels become high enough in the hour before sunset to begin to have an 
effect on tropospheric chemistry. At night the levels of NO3 become much higher, typically reaching 
values of around 8 ¥ 107 molecules/cm3 compared to only about 1  ¥ 106 molecules/cm3 for hydroxyl 
radical. Although the hydroxyl radical reacts 10–1000 times faster than NO3, the much higher con-
centration of the latter means that it is responsible for much of the atmospheric chemistry that 
occurs at night. The nitrate radical adds across the double bonds in alkenes leading to the formation 
of reactive radical species that participate in smog formation.
13.5.2  PHOTOLYZABLE  COMPOUNDS  IN THE ATMOSPHERE
It may be useful at this time to review the types of compounds capable of undergoing photolysis in 
the troposphere and thus initiating chain reaction. Under most tropospheric conditions, the most 
important of these is NO2:
 NO2 + hn (l < 394 nm) Æ NO + O (13.19)
In re lati v e l y po ll u ted atmospheres, the ne xt most importan t photodissociati on reacti on is that o f 
carbonyl compounds, particularly formaldehyde:
 CH2O + hn (l < 335 nm) Æ H∑ + HC∑O (13.70)
Hydrogen peroxide photodissociates to produce two hydroxyl radicals:
 HOOH  + hn (l < 350 nm) Æ 2HO∑ (13.71)
Finally, organic peroxides may be formed and subsequently dissociate by the following reactions, 
starting with a peroxyl radical:
 H3COO∑ + HOO∑ Æ H3COOH + O2 (13.72)
 H3COOH + hn (l < 350 nm) Æ H3CO∑ + HO∑ (13.73)348 Environmental Chemistry
It should be noted that Reactions 13.70, 13.71, and 13.73 each gives rise to two free radical species 
per photon absorbed. Ozone undergoes photochemical dissociation to produce excited oxygen atoms 
at wavelengths less than 315 nm. These atoms may react with H2O to produce hydroxyl radicals.
13.6 REACTIVITY OF HYDROCARBONS
The reactivity of hydrocarbons in the smog formation process is an important consideration in under-
standing the process and in developing control strategies. It is useful to know which are the most 
reactive hydrocarbons so that their release can be minimized. Less reactive hydrocarbons, of which 
propane is a good example, may cause smog formation far downwind from the point of release.
Hydrocarbon reactivity is best based upon the interaction of hydrocarbons with hydroxyl radical. 
Methane, the least reactive common gas-phase hydrocarbon with an atmospheric half-life ex ceeding 
10 days, is assigned a reactivity of 1.0. (Despite its low reactivity, methane is so abundant in the 
atmosphere that it accounts for a signifi  cant fraction of total hydroxyl radical reactions.) In contrast, 
b-pinene produced by conifer trees and other vegetation, is almost 9000 times as reactive as meth-
ane, and d-limonene, produced by orange rind, is almost 19,000 times as reactive. Relative to their 
rates of reaction with hydroxyl radical, hydrocarbon reactivities may be classifi  ed from I through V 
as shown in Table 13.2.
13.7 INORGANIC PRODUCTS FROM SMOG
Two major classes of inorganic products from smog are sulfates and nitrates. Inorganic sulfates and 
nitrates, along with sulfur and nitrogen oxides, can contribute to acidic precipitation, corrosion, 
reduced visibility, and adverse health effects.

a Based on an assigned reactivity of 1.0 for methane reacting with hydroxyl radical.Photochemical Smog 349
Although slow in a clean atmosphere, the oxidation of SO2 to sulfate species is relatively rapid 
under smoggy conditions. During severe photochemical smog conditions, oxidation rates of 5–10% 
per hour may occur, as compared to only a fraction of a percent per hour under normal atmospheric 
conditions. Thus, sulfur dioxide exposed to smog can produce very high local concentrations of 
sulfate, which can aggravate already bad atmospheric conditions.
Several oxidant species in smog can oxidize SO2. Among the oxidants are compounds, including 
O3, NO3, and N2O5, as well as reactive radical species, particularly HO∑, HOO∑, O, RO∑, and ROO∑. 
The two major primary reactions are oxygen transfer,
 SO2 + O (from O, RO∑, ROO∑) Æ SO3 Æ H2SO4, sulfates  (13.74)
or addition of other species. As an example of the latter, HO∑ adds to SO2 to form a reactive species 
which can further react with oxygen, nitrogen oxides, or other species to yield sulfates, other sulfur 
compounds, or compounds of nitrogen:
 HO∑ + SO2 Æ HOSOO∑ (13.75)
The presence of HO∑ (typically at a level of 3  ¥ 106 radicals/cm3, but appreciably higher in a smoggy 
atmosphere) makes this a likely route. Addition of SO2 to RO∑ or ROO∑ can yield organic sulfur 
compounds.
It should be noted that the reaction of H2S with HO∑ is quite rapid. As a result, the normal atmo-
spheric half-life of H2S of about one-half day becomes much shorter in the presence of photochemical 
smog.
Inorganic nitrates or nitric acid are formed by several reactions in smog. Among the important 
reactions forming nitric acid are the reaction of N2O5 with water (Reaction 13.35) and the addition 
of hydroxyl radical to NO2 (Reaction 13.39). The oxidation of NO or NO2 to nitrate species may 
occur after absorption of gas by an aerosol droplet. Nitric acid formed by these reactions reacts with 
ammonia in the atmosphere to form ammonium nitrate:
 NH3 + HNO3 Æ NH4NO3 (13.76)
Other nitrate salts may also be formed.
Nitric acid and nitrates are among the more damaging end products of smog. In addition to pos-
sible adverse effects on plants and animals, they cause severe corrosion problems. Electrical relay 
contacts and small springs associated with electrical switches are especially susceptible to damage 
from nitrate-induced corrosion.
13.8 EFFECTS OF SMOG
The harmful effects of smog occur mainly in the areas of (1) human health and comfort, (2) damage 
to materials, (3) effects on the atmosphere, and (4) toxicity to plants. The exact degree to which 
exposure to smog affects human health is not known, although substantial adverse effects are 
suspected. Pungent-smelling, smog-produced ozone is known to be toxic. Ozone at 0.15 ppm causes 
coughing, wheezing, bronchial constriction, and irritation to the respiratory mucous system in 
 healthy, exercising individuals. In March 2008, the U.S. EPA released a revised eight-hour national 
ambient air quality standard for ground-level ozone of 0.075 ppm ozone based upon likely health 
effects of this pollutant. At the same time, the EPA also revised the secondary standard for ground-
level ozone to the same 0.075 ppm level. The secondary standard is based upon evidence of ozone 
damage to plants, trees, and crops during the growing season. In addition to ozone, oxidant peroxy-
acyl  nit r ates and aldehydes found in smog are eye irritants.350 Environmental Chemistry
Materials are adversely affected by some smog components. Rubber has a high affi  nity for ozone 
and is cracked and aged by it. Indeed, the cracking of rubber used to be employed as a test for the 
presence of ozone. Ozone attacks natural rubber and similar materials by oxidizing and breaking 
double bonds in the polymer according to the following reaction:

This oxidative scission type of reaction causes bonds in the polymer structure to break and results 
in deterioration of the polymer.
Aerosol particles that reduce visibility are formed by the polymerization of the smaller molecules 
produced in smog-forming reactions.7 Since these reactions largely involve the oxidation of hydrocar-
bons, it is not surprising that oxygen-containing organics make up the bulk of the particulate matter 
produced from smog. Ether-soluble aerosols collected from the Los Angeles atmosphere have shown an 
empirical formula of approximately CH2O. Among the specifi  c kinds of compounds identifi  ed in organic 
smog aerosols are alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, organic acids, esters, and organic nitrates. Hydrocarbons 
of plant origin are prominent among the precursors to particle formation in photochemical smog.

of reaction product molecules. In support of this view are electron micrographs of these aerosols 
showing that smog aerosol particles in the micrometer-size region consist of liquid droplets with 
an inorganic electron-opaque core (Figure 13.6). Thus, particulate matter from a source other 
than smog may have some infl  uence on the formation and properties of smog aerosols.
In view of worldwide shortages of food, the known harmful effects of smog on plants are of 
particular concern. These effects are largely due to oxidants in the smoggy atmosphere. The three 
major oxidants involved are ozone, PAN, and nitrogen oxides. Of these, PAN has the highest toxi-
city to plants, attacking younger leaves and causing “bronzing” and “glazing” of their surfaces. 
Exposure for several hours to an atmosphere containing PAN at a level of only 0.02–0.05 ppm will 
damage vegetation. The sulfhydryl group of proteins in organisms is susceptible to damage by PAN, 
which reacts with such groups as both an o xidizing agent and an acetylating agent. Fortunately , 
PAN is usually present at only low levels. Nitrogen oxides occur at relatively high concentrations 
during smoggy conditions, but their toxicity to plants is relatively low.

impactor, showing electron-opaque nuclei in the centers of the impacted droplets.Photochemical Smog 351
Short-chain alkyl hydroperoxides, which were mentioned in Section 13.4, occur at low levels 
under smoggy conditions, and even in remote atmospheres. It is possible that these species can oxi-
dize DNA bases, causing adverse genetic effects. Alkyl hydroperoxides are formed under smoggy 
conditions by the reaction of alkyl peroxy radicals with hydroperoxy radical, HO2∑, as shown for the 
formation of methyl hydroperoxide below:
 H3CO2∑ + HO2∑ Æ H3COOH + O2 (13.78)
Ames assays of methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, and n-butyl hydroperoxides (see Chapter 22) have shown 
s o m e  te n d e n c y  t o w ar d  m u ta g e ni c i ty  o n  s e l ec t  s train s  o f  Salmonella typhimurium , although any 
conclusions drawn from such studies on human health should be made with caution. 
The low toxicity of nitrogen oxides and the usually low levels of PAN, hydroperoxides, and other 
oxidants present in smog leave ozone as the greatest smog-produced threat to plant life. Some plant 
species, including sword-leaf lettuce, black nightshade, quickweed, and double-fortune tomato, are 
so susceptible to the effects of ozone and other photochemical oxidants that they are used as bioin-
dicators of the presence of smog. Typical of the phytotoxicity of O3, ozone damage to a lemon leaf 
is manifested by chlorotic stippling (characteristic yellow spots on a green leaf), as represented in 
Figure 13.7. Ponderosa and Jeffrey pines exposed to ozone and smog in California’s San Bernardino 
Mountains have suffered chlorotic mottle and premature needle death. Reduction in plant growth 
may occur without visible lesions on the plant.
Brief exposure to approximately 0.06 ppm of ozone may temporarily cut photosynthesis rates in 
some plants in half. Crop damage from ozone and other photochemical air pollutants in California 
alone is estimated to cost millions of dollars each year. The geographic distribution of damage to 
plants in California is illustrated in Figure 13.8.

stippling on the green upper surface caused by ozone exposure.

14.1 CLIMATE CHANGE AND ANTHROPOGENIC EFFECTS
Several pieces of evidence are used to infer the long record of the earth’s climate. These include 
fossil records, isotopic abundances in polar ice, and air entrained in it. For conditions going back to 
several centuries, the size and trace element content of tree rings are particularly useful and refl  ect 
abundance of water, temperatures, air composition, and presence of pollutants under which each 
ring was formed.1
There is a very strong connection between life forms on Earth and the nature of the earth’s 
 climate, which determines its suitability for life. As proposed by James Lovelock, a British chemist, 
this forms the basis of the Gaia hypothesis , which contends that the atmospheric O2/CO2 balance 
established and sustained by organisms determines and maintains the earth’s climate and other 
environmental conditions. For about 3.5 billion years, stabilizing feedback mechanisms have main-
tained the earth/atmosphere boundary region within narrow liquid water conditions in which life 
can exist. It is incumbent upon humankind to avoid upsetting this delicate balance within just a few 
years’ period of time. 
Ever since life fi  rst appeared on Earth, the atmosphere has been infl  uenced by the metabolic 
processes of living organisms. When the fi  rst primitive life molecules were formed approximately 
3.5 billion years ago, the atmosphere was very different from its present state. At that time, it was 
chemically reducing and was thought to contain nitrogen, methane, ammonia, water vapor, and 
hydrogen, but no elemental oxygen. These gases and water in the sea were bombarded by intense, 
bond-breaking ultraviolet radiation which, along with lightning and radiation from radionuclides, 
provided the energy to bring about chemical reactions that resulted in the production of relatively 
complicated molecules, including even amino acids and sugars. From this rich chemical mixture, life 
molecules evolved. Initially, these very primitive life forms derived their energy from fermentation 
of organic matter formed by chemical and photochemical processes, but eventually they gained the 
capability to produce organic matter, “{CH2O},” by photosynthesis utilizing solar light energy ( hn),
 CO2 + H2O + hn Æ {CH2O} + O2(g) (14.1)
and the stage was set for the massive biochemical transformation that resulted in the production of 
almost all the atmosphere’s oxygen.
The oxygen initially produced by photosynthesis was probably quite toxic to primitive life forms. 
However, much of this oxygen was converted to iron oxides by reaction with soluble iron(II):
 4Fe2+ + O2 + 4H2O Æ 2Fe2O3 + 8H+ (14.2)
The enormous deposits of iron oxides thus formed provide convincing evidence for the liberation of 
free oxygen into the primitive atmosphere.356 Environmental Chemistry
Eventually enzyme systems developed that enabled organisms to mediate the reaction of waste-
product oxygen with oxidizable organic matter in the sea. Later this mode of waste-product disposal 
was utilized by organisms to produce energy for respiration, which is now the mechanism by which 
nonphotosynthetic organisms obtain energy.
In time, oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere, providing an abundant source of O2 for respira-
tion. It had an additional benefi  t in that it enabled the formation of an ozone shield against solar 
ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere. With this shield in place, Earth became a much more hos-
pitable environment for life, and life forms were enabled to move from the protective surroundings 
of the sea to the more exposed environment of the land.
Other instances of climatic change and regulation induced by organisms can be cited. An impor-
tant example is the maintenance of atmospheric carbon dioxide at low levels through the action of 
photosynthetic organisms (note from Reaction 14.1 that photosynthesis removes CO2 from the 
 atmosphere). But, at an ever-accelerating pace during the last 200 years, another organism, human-
kind, has engaged in a number of activities that are altering the atmosphere profoundly. As noted in 
Chapter 1, human infl  uences are so strong that it is useful to invoke a fi  fth sphere of the environ-
ment, the anthrosphere. 
The atmosphere receives a number of contaminants from the anthrosphere. These substances 
may have pronounced effects far out of proportion to their fraction of the total mass of the atmo-
sphere, especially in the following areas: (1) absorption of outgoing infrared radiation, thereby 
warming the atmosphere, (2) scattering and refl  ection of sunlight, (3) formation of photochemically 
reactive species such as NO2 that are activated by absorption of ultraviolet radiation, (4) formation 
of catalytic species such as ozone-destroying Cl atoms produced by the photodissociation of CFCs 
in the stratosphere.
Human activities that have a strong infl  uence on the atmosphere include industrial activities that 
emit particles and pollutant gases; fossil fuel combustion that emits particles and oxides of carbon, 
sulfur, and nitrogen; modes of transportation reliant on fossil fuels that emit air pollutants; alteration 
of land surfaces, including deforestation and desertifi  cation; burning of biomass and vegetation 
that emits soot and carbon and nitrogen oxides; and agricultural practices such as the cultivation of 
rice, which emits large quantities of methane. Major effects of these processes include increased 
acidity of the atmosphere, elevated levels of atmospheric oxidants, increased global warming, 
increased levels of gases that threaten the stratospheric ozone layer, and increased corrosivity of the 
atmosphere.
In 1957, photochemical smog was only beginning to be recognized as a serious problem, acid 
rain and the greenhouse effect were scientifi  c curiosities, and the ozone-destroying potential of 
CFCs had not even been imagined. In that year, Revelle and Suess2 prophetically referred to human 
perturbations of Earth and its climate as a massive “geophysical experiment.” The effects that this 
experiment may have on the global atmosphere are discussed in this chapter.
14.1.1  CHANGES  IN CLIMATE
Ample evidence exists of massive changes in the earth’s climate in times past. Indeed, humankind 
exists now in an approximately 10,000-year interglacial era called the holocene . Evidence from the 
past suggests that major changes in climate may occur very rapidly, within a few years’ period of 
time. These may occur through positive feedback mechanisms in which, once a certain threshold is 
passed, the change feeds on itself and proceeds rapidly and irreversibly. One analogy is that of a 
canoe. Leaning gently to one side will cause the canoe to tip slightly such that it rights itself once 
the occupant has stopped leaning. However, beyond a certain point, the canoe tips over completely 
and irreversibly. Cooling of the climate may result in more coverage of the earth’s surface with ice 
and snow, which refl  ects solar energy and results in more cooling and more ice and snow. Drought 
can destroy vegetation, without which there is less transpiration of moisture into the atmosphere, 
causing less rainfall and even greater loss of vegetation.The Endangered Global Atmosphere 357
Fluctuations in climate have signifi  cant ecological effects, both direct and indirect. In recent 
years, attention has shifted from short-term, localized weather phenomena (rainfall, snow coverage, 
temperature) to climate phenomena on a larger scale and over longer time periods. Global scale 
phenomena, especially the El Niño Southern Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation can 
have very signifi  cant ecological effects lasting for several years over huge areas of the globe. Effects 
on terrestrial plants and their productivity can cause changes in animal populations and the relation-
ships between herbivores and carnivores. Upwelling of nutrients and ocean temperatures can cause 
variations in photosynthetic activity in marine environments, thereby affecting fi  sh populations and 
other marine biota.
14.2 GLOBAL WARMING
This section deals with infrared-absorbing trace gases (other than water vapor) in the atmosphere 
that contribute to global warming and with the infl  uence of particles on temperature. Figure 14.1 
shows global temperature trends since 1880 and illustrates a steady warming trend during recent 
decades. In addition to being a scientifi  c issue, greenhouse warming of the atmosphere has also 
become a major policy, political, and economic issue.
Carbon dioxide and other infrared-absorbing trace gases in the atmosphere contribute to global 
warming—the “greenhouse effect”—by allowing incoming solar radiant energy to penetrate into 
the earth’s surface while reabsorbing infrared radiation emanating from it. As shown in Figure 14.2, 
atmospheric levels of “greenhouse gas” carbon dioxide have increased at a rapid rate during recent 
decades and are continuing to do so. Concern over this phenomenon has intensifi  ed since about 
1980. Adding to that concern is that, according to the Goddard Institute of Space Science, the eight 
warmest years on record have occurred since 1998 and the 14 warmest years recorded have taken 
place since 1990. The warmest of these was 2005. The year 2007 was tied with 1998 as the second 
warmest year on record. The near record warmth of 2007 is all the more remarkable because the 
year was at a minimum of solar irradiance and the natural El Niño–La Niña cycle of the equatorial 
Pacifi  c Ocean was in its cool phase.

Chemically and photochemically, carbon dioxide is a comparatively insignifi  cant species because of 
its relatively low concentrations and low photochemical reactivity. The one signifi  cant photochemi-
cal reaction that carbon dioxide undergoes, and a major source of stratospheric CO, is the photo-
dissociation of CO2 by energetic solar ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere:
 CO2 + hn Æ CO + O (14.3)
The most obvious factor in increased atmospheric carbon dioxide is consumption of carbon-
containing fossil fuels. In addition, release of CO2 from the biodegradation of biomass and uptake 
by photosynthesis are important factors determining overall CO2 levels in the atmosphere. The role 
of photosynthesis is illustrated in Figure 14.2, which shows a seasonal cycle in carbon dioxide levels 
in the northern hemisphere. Maximum values occur in April and minimum values in late September 
or October. These oscillations are due to the “photosynthetic pulse,” infl  uenced most strongly by for-
ests in middle latitudes and located predominantly in the Northern Hemisphere. Forests have a much 
greater infl  uence than other vegetation because trees carry out more photosynthesis. Furthermore, 
forests store enough fi  xed but readily oxidizable carbon in the form of wood and humus to have a 
marked infl  uence on atmospheric CO2 content. Thus, during the summer months, forest trees carry out 
enough photosynthesis to reduce the atmospheric carbon dioxide content markedly. During the 
winter, metabolism of biota, such as bacterial decay of humus, releases a signifi  cant amount of CO2. 
Therefore, the current worldwide destruction of forests and conversion of forest lands into agricul-
tural uses contributes substantially to a greater overall increase in atmospheric CO2 levels.FIGURE 14.2 Increases in atmospheric CO2 levels in recent years. The inset illustrates seasonal variations 
in the northern hemisphere.315320325330335340345350

With current trends, it is likely that global CO2 levels will double from preindustrial levels later 
this century, which may well raise the earth’s mean surface temperature by 1.5–4.5°C. Such a 
change might have the potential to cause more massive irreversible environmental changes than any 
other disaster short of global nuclear war or asteroid impact.
A consistent annual increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide of about 1 ppm/year was character-
istic of the trends shown in Figure 14.2 until relatively recently, but now the annual increase is closer 
to 2 ppm. As shown in Figure 14.3, per capita carbon dioxide emissions are highest for industrial-
ized countries and development of countries with high populations, such as China and India, can be 
expected to add large quantities of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere in the future. CFCs, which also 
are greenhouse gases, were not even introduced into the atmosphere until the 1930s. Although 
trends in levels of these gases are well known, their effects on global temperature and climate 
are much less certain. The phenomenon has been the subject of much computer modeling. Most 
models predict global warming of at least 3.0°C and up to 5.5°C occurring over a period of just a 
few decades. These estimates are sobering because they correspond to the approximate temperature 
increase since the last ice age 18,000 years ago, which took place at a much slower pace of only 
about 1°C or 2°C per 1000 years. Such warming would have profound effects on rainfall, plant 
growth, and sea levels, which might rise as much as 0.5–1.5 m.
Both positive and negative feedback mechanisms may be involved in determining the rates at 
which carbon dioxide and methane (discussed below) build up in the atmosphere. Laboratory stud-
ies indicate that increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere cause accelerated uptake of this gas by plants 
undergoing photosynthesis, which tends to slow the buildup of atmospheric CO2. Given adequate 
rainfall, plants living in a warmer climate that would result from the greenhouse effect would grow 
faster and take up more CO2. This could be an especially signifi  cant effect of forests, which have a 
high CO2-fi xing ability. However, the projected rate of increase in carbon dioxide levels is so rapid 
that forests would lag behind in their ability to fi  x additional CO2. Similarly, higher atmospheric 
FIGURE 14.3  Per capita emissions of carbon dioxide. Rapid industrialization of high-population countries, 
particularly China and India, can be expected to add much larger quantities of carbon dioxide to the atmo-
sphere in the future. Because of its huge population, China is almost equal to the United States in total annual 
carbon dioxide emissions for the entire country.Metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted per

CO2 concentrations will result in accelerated sorption of the gas by oceans. The amount of dissolved 
CO2 in the oceans is about 60 times the amount of CO2 gas in the atmosphere. However, the times 
for the transfer of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the ocean are of the order of years. 
Because of low mixing rates, the times for the transfer of carbon dioxide from the upper approxi-
mately 100-m layer of the oceans to ocean depths is much longer, of the order of decades. Therefore, 
like the uptake of CO2 by forests, increased absorption by oceans will lag behind the emissions of 
CO2. A concern with increased levels of CO2 in the oceans is the lowering of ocean water pH that 
will result. Even though such an effect will be slight, of the order of one tenth to several tenths of a 
pH unit, it has the potential to strongly impact organisms that live in ocean water. Severe drought 
conditions resulting from climatic warming could cut down substantially on CO2 uptake by plants. 
Warmer conditions would accelerate the release of both CO2 and CH4 by microbial degradation of 
organic matter. (It is important to realize that about twice as much carbon is held in soil in dead 
organic matter—necrocarbon—potentially degradable to CO2 and CH4 as is present in the atmo-
sphere.) Global warming might speed up the rates at which biodegradation adds these gases to the 
atmosphere.
14.2.1  METHANE  AND OTHER GREENHOUSE  GASES
Among the gases other than carbon dioxide that contribute to global warming are CFCs, fl  uoro-
carbons, HCFC, HFCs, N2O, and, especially, methane, CH4. Now at a level of around 1.8 ppm in the 
atmosphere, methane is going up at a rate of almost 0.02 ppm/year. The comparatively very rapid 
increase in methane levels is attributed to a number of factors resulting from human activities. 
Among these are direct leakage of natural gas, by-product emissions from coal mining and petro-
leum recovery, and release from the burning of savannas and tropical forests. Biogenic sources 
resulting from human activities produce large amounts of atmospheric methane. These include 
methane from bacteria degrading organic matter such as municipal refuse in landfi  lls; methane 
evolved from anaerobic biodegradation of organic matter in rice paddies; and methane emitted as 
the result of bacterial action in the digestive tracts of ruminant animals.
In  a d di ti o n  t o  a c tin g  a s  a  gr ee nh o u s e  g a s ,  m e th an e  h a s  s i gni fi  cant effects upon atmospheric 
chemistry. It produces atmospheric CO as an intermediate oxidation product and infl  uences concen-
trations of atmospheric hydroxyl radicals and ozone. In the stratosphere, it produces hydrogen and 
H2O, but acts to remove ozone-destroying chlorine. 
A term called radiative forcing  is used to describe the reduction in infrared radiation penetrating 
outward through the atmosphere per unit increase in the level of gas in the atmosphere. The radiative 
forcing of CH4 is about 25 times that of CO2. Increases in the concentration of methane and several 
other greenhouse gases have such a disproportionate effect on retention of infrared radiation because 
their infrared absorption spectra fi  ll gaps in the overall spectrum of outbound radiation not covered by 
much more abundant carbon dioxide and water vapor. Therefore, whereas an increase in carbon dioxide 
concentration has a comparatively small incremental effect because the gas is already absorbing such a 
high fraction of infrared radiation in regions of the spectrum where it absorbs, an increase in the con-
centration of methane, CFC, or other greenhouse gases has comparatively a much larger effect. 
14.2.2  PARTICLES  AND GLOBAL  WARMING
Whereas the effects of carbon dioxide and other gases on temperature are relatively easy to calcu-
late, the effects of particles are much more complicated. Atmospheric particles have both direct 
effects exerted by scattering and absorbing radiation and indirect effects in changing the microphy-
sical structure, lifetimes, and quantities of clouds (see condensation nuclei in Section 9.5). Particles 
interact with and scatter the  radiation that is of a wavelength similar to the size of the particles most 
strongly. Most of the incoming solar energy is at wavelengths <4 μm and most particles are smaller 
than 4 μm, so the major effect of atmospheric particles is to scatter radiation from incoming solar The Endangered Global Atmosphere 361
energy, which has a cooling effect on the atmosphere. Some kinds of particles, such as those compo-
sed of black carbon and soot, absorb incoming solar radiation, thereby warming the atmosphere.
Liquid water droplets composing clouds can both scatter incoming radiation and absorb out-
bound infrared radiation. Clouds at lower altitudes act mainly to lower atmospheric temperature by 
scattering lower wavelength radiation, whereas clouds at higher altitudes tend to absorb outbound 
infrared causing temperature increases. Aerosol particles, such as sulfate salts that act as cloud 
condensation nuclei upon which atmospheric water vapor condenses, tend to increase the number of 
particles, which are therefore more numerous. In general, this has a cooling effect.
Overall, the effects of particles on global temperature are variable and not particularly well 
understood. Both cooling and warming effects may occur. Modeling these effects are much more 
challenging than modeling the effects of gaseous atmospheric constituents such as carbon dioxide.
14.2.3  THE OUTLOOK  FOR GLOBAL  WARMING  AND ASSOCIATED  EFFECTS
It is certain that atmospheric CO2 levels will continue to increase signifi  cantly. The degree to which 
this occurs depends upon future levels of CO2 production and the fraction of that production that 
remains in the atmosphere. Given the plausible projections of CO2 production and a reasonable 
estimate that half of that amount will remain in the atmosphere, projections can be made that indi-
cate that sometime approximately during the next 100 years, the concentration of this gas will reach 
600 ppm in the atmosphere. This is well over twice the levels estimated for preindustrial times. 
Much less certain are the effects that this change will have on climate. It is virtually impossible for 
the elaborate computer models used to estimate these effects to accurately take account of all varia-
bles, such as the degree and nature of cloud cover. Clouds both refl  ect incoming light radiation and 
absorb outgoing infrared radiation, with the former effect tending to predominate. The magnitudes 
of these effects depend upon the degree of cloud cover, brightness, altitude, and thickness. In the 
case of clouds, too, feedback phenomena occur; for example, warming induces formation of more 
clouds, which refl  ect more incoming energy. 
Drought is one of the most serious problems that could arise from major climatic change resulting 
from greenhouse warming. Typically, a three-degree warming would be accompanied by a 
10% decrease in precipitation. Water shortages would be aggravated, not just from decreased rainfall, 
but from increased evaporation as well. Increased evaporation results in decreased runoff, thereby 
reducing water available for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use. Water shortages, in turn, lead 
to increased demand for irrigation and to the production of lower quality, higher salinity runoff water 
and wastewater. In the United States, such a problem would be especially intense in the Colorado 
River basin, which supplies much of the water used in the rapidly growing U.S. Southwest.
A variety of other problems, some of them unforeseen as of now, could result from global warm-
ing. An example is the effect of warming on plant and animal pests—insects, weeds, diseases, and 
rodents. Many of these would certainly thrive much better under warmer conditions. 
Interestingly, another air pollutant, acid-rain-forming sulfur dioxide (see Section 14.4), may have 
a  c o u n t e r a c t i n g  e f f e c t  o n  g r e e n h o u s e  g a s e s .  T h i s  i s  b e c a u s e  s u l f u r  d i o x i d e  i s  o x i d i z e d  i n  t h e  
 atmosphere to sulfuric acid, forming a light-refl  ecting haze. Furthermore, the sulfuric acid and 
resulting sulfates act as condensation nuclei upon  which atmospheric water vapor condenses, thereby 
increasing the extent, density, and brightness of light-refl  ecting cloud cover. Sulfate aerosols are 
particularly effective in counteracting greenhouse warming in central Europe and the eastern United 
States during the summer.
14.3 GREEN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY TO ALLEVIATE GLOBAL WARMING
Although there are still “global-warming denyers” who attempt to discredit those who have concern 
over global warming, the overwhelming consensus of reputable scientists is that global warming is 
taking place and that greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, are the main cause. The 362 Environmental Chemistry
 ques tion for responsible people then becomes what to do about the problem. The possibilities can be 
divided into three categories: (1) minimization, (2) counteracting measures, and (3) adaptation.
14.3.1  MINIMIZATION
Minimization  refers to measures taken to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Minimization is 
tied inextricably to energy production and utilization, since most greenhouse gas emissions are 
from the burning of fossil fuels. Fortunately , fossil fuel may be consumed much more effi  ciently 
utilizing existing and developing energy conservation measures. Effi  cient utilization of fossil energy 
can be accomplished without major economic disruption. A prime example would be the conversion 
of the U.S. private vehicle fl  eet to hybrid internal combustion/electric propulsion. Hybrid vehicles 
can be manufactured with the capability to charge their batteries from house electrical current to 
provide suffi  cient charge for approximately 30 km of travel before the internal combustion engine 
even has to be turned on, which would take care of as much as half of routine commuting and travel. 
As a green fringe benefi  t without additional charge, employers could provide charging stations in 
parking facilities so that vehicles could be recharged during the work day. Such a system could 
readily reduce by 50% the amount of fuel and hence the emissions of greenhouse gases of current 
private automotive transport systems.
Conversion of the current U.S. freight transportation system from truck to electrifi  ed rail to 
the maximum extent possible would make a further major reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. 
Since about 1990, there has been a signifi  cant shift in the amount of freight transported by rail in 
the form of shipping containers and truck trailers to the point that some rail freight lines are nearing 
their maximum capacity. Unlike Europe, most railways in the United States are not electrifi  ed, 
although that certainly could be done and the electricity could be generated by means that do not 
require burning of fossil fuels. Interstate highway rights of way can serve as routes for new rail lines 
in some cases.
Utilization of fossil fuels for heating and air conditioning can be done much more effi  ciently. The 
best fuel for home heating is natural gas (methane, CH4). This fuel emits the least amount of green-
house gas carbon dioxide per unit heat delivered because of its relatively high content of hydrogen. 
Rather than burning methane in a furnace, it can be used as a fuel in a small internal combustion 
engine connected to a heat pump to pump heat from the outside. The exhaust gases from the engine 
can be cooled and the water vapor in them condensed to capture additional heat.
One way to reduce the release of carbon dioxide is by using biomass as fuel or raw material for 
the manufacture of various products. Burning a biomass fuel does release carbon dioxide to the 
atmosphere, but an exactly equal amount of carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere in the 
photosynthetic process by which the biomass is made, so there is no net addition of CO2. Unless and 
until biomass-derived materials used in feedstocks are burned, their use represents a net loss of 
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Another potential use of green chemistry to prevent addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere 
is through carbon sequestration  in which carbon dioxide is produced, but is bound in a form such 
that it is not released to the atmosphere.3 This approach has the greatest potential in applications 
where the carbon dioxide is produced in a concentrated form. Carbon from coal can be reacted with 
oxygen and water to produce elemental hydrogen and carbon dioxide in a coal gasifi  cation process. 
The net reaction for this production is the following:
 2C + O2 + 2H2O Æ 2CO2 + 2H2 (14.4)
The hydrogen generated can be used as a pollution-free fuel in fuel cells or combustion engines. The 
carbon dioxide can be pumped into deep ocean waters, although this has the potential to lower 
ocean pH slightly, which would be detrimental to marine organisms. Another option is to pump the 
carbon dioxide deep underground. A side benefi  t of the latter approach is that in some areas carbon The Endangered Global Atmosphere 363
dioxide pumped underground can be used to recover additional crude oil from depleted oil-bearing 
formations.
Carbon dioxide can actually be converted to fuel if there is an abundant and cheap source of 
elemental H2, such as might be the case by electrolyzing water with excess electrical power gener-
ated by wind or by abundant geothermal energy, a process used in Iceland. The way in which this 
can be done is by the following reverse water gas shift reaction:
 CO2 + H2 Æ CO + H2O (14.5)
Fischer–Tropsch synthesis can then be used to make hydrocarbons and other organic fuels and 
 chemicals from the CO and additional elemental hydrogen.
The best way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from home heating is to avoid the use of fossil 
fuels entirely. Substantial progress has been made in solar heating systems that heat homes without 
using fossil fuels. Another good measure is the use of electricity for heating and air conditioning, 
generating the electricity from energy sources other than fossil fuels. Additional options for generat-
ing electricity without adding to the burden of greenhouse gases are discussed in Chapter 19.
A green technological approach to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions is to develop alter-
native methods of energy production. One thing that would be very benefi  cial is the development of 
more effi  cient photovoltaic cells. These devices have become marginally competitive for the genera-
tion of electricity , and even relatively small improvements in effi  ciency would enable their much 
wider use, replacing fossil fuel sources of electricity generation. Another device that would be 
extremely useful is a system for the direct photochemical dissociation of water to produce elemental 
hydrogen and oxygen, which could be used in fuel cells. An application of green biochemistry that 
would reduce carbon dioxide emissions is the development of plants with much higher effi  ciencies 
for photosynthesis. Plants now are only about 0.5% effi  cient in converting light energy to chemical 
energy. Raising this value to only 1% would make a vast difference in the economics of producing 
biomass as a substitute for fossil carbon.
Regardless of the technologies used to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, political and eco-
nomic pressures must be applied to ensure that they are implemented and sustained. One of the most 
directly effective measures consists of mileage standards  for vehicles. These were imposed in the 
United States during the earlier years of the “energy crisis” but inexcusably were allowed to lan-
guish during the latter 1900s and early 2000s. Finally, in 2007, laws were passed requiring gradual 
imposition of higher mileage for new vehicles. Another useful device is that of carbon taxes on fuels 
that emit carbon dioxide. Very high taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel have for years resulted in the 
use of very effi  cient vehicles in Europe. Inherently more effi  cient diesel-powered vehicles are popu-
lar in Europe, but diesel automobiles are rare in the United States where gasoline has been relatively 
cheap. Another effective means for reducing carbon dioxide emissions is the cap and trade  system 
in which concerns are allocated specifi  c amounts of carbon that they can emit. If they emit less than 
the limit, they may sell the right to emit carbon to a concern that is exceeding its limit. All of these 
measures have the advantage of not dictating technologies to be used, leaving that aspect to the 
ingenuity of the private sector. 
One of the more contentious issues related to greenhouse gas emissions has been the Kyoto treaty 
and the refusal of the United States to ratify that agreement. This treaty evolved from a 1997 meet-
ing of 160 nations in Kyoto, Japan. The agreement called for stabilization of greenhouse gas emis-
sions to 1990 levels during the period 2008–2012, which would have led to 23% less of the emissions 
below levels projected during the 1990s without remedial action. The United States has refused to 
ratify the agreement because it exempted large developing countries, especially India and China, 
from participating for economic reasons. Such countries produce only a small fraction of as much 
greenhouse gas per capita as is the case with the United States and several other industrial countries. 
During the early 2000s, as the economies of India and China have developed, their emissions of 
greenhouse gases have accelerated signifi  cantly.364 Environmental Chemistry
14.3.2  COUNTERACTING  MEASURES
Counteracting measures  for reducing global warming consist of schemes such as the injection of 
light-refl  ecting particles into the upper atmosphere. The scale required of such measures is so great 
that they are probably impossible to implement in a meaningful way. One possibility is to increase 
(or at least not reduce) the amount of sulfur gases emitted to the atmosphere that oxidize to sulfuric 
acid which serves to generate condensation nuclei that produce light-refl  ecting clouds. Another far-
out possibility would be to use high-fl  ying tanker aircraft to separately inject hydrogen chloride and 
ammonia vapors into the atmosphere. Any chemistry student who has had separate beakers of 
hydrochloric acid and ammonia solution close together knows that HCl and NH3 react, as shown in 
the following equation,
 HCl( g) + NH3(g) Æ NH4Cl(s) (14.6)
to produce a dense fog of ammonium chloride particles that might serve as cloud condensation 
nuclei. In addition to the obvious questions regarding air pollution that this remedy raises, it might 
be diffi  cult to fi  nd aircrew willing to fl  y Airbus A380 jumbo jet aircraft into the lower stratosphere 
laden with pressurized tanks of corrosive hydrogen chloride and ammonia.
A possibly signifi  cant counteracting measure is modifi  cation of the earth’s surface in a manner 
so as to refl  ect light. This can potentially be done with appropriate kinds of vegetation in the form 
of forests and grasslands and by agricultural practices that minimize exposure of light-absorbing 
freshly cultivated soil. Again, the scale required to make any signifi  cant difference would be huge. 
Another small effect might be obtained by designing surfaces (roofs and parking lot surfaces) of 
anthrospheric structures to maximize refl  ection of solar radiation. Such a measure would favor 
refl ective aluminum roofs over dark roofi  ng and light-colored concrete over black asphalt for park-
ing lot surfaces.
14.3.3  ADAPTATION
Since global warming will in fact occur and neither minimization nor counteracting measures will 
be suffi  cient to stop it, adaptation to climate warming will be required. Other than increases in 
global temperature, there are many effects of global warming suggesting a variety of adaptations. It 
may be anticipated that adaptation to global warming will be one of the most signifi  cant activities 
of green science and technology in the future.
Water shortages and drought will constitute perhaps the most troublesome aspects of climate 
warming. Water, already in short supply in many parts of the world, will become scarcer. It will be 
necessary to implement more effi  cient irrigation practices and to grow crops that require less irriga-
tion. One approach with signifi  cant promise is to grow crops on arid coastal lands irrigated with 
seawater. Plants that can grow in seawater are called halophytes and can produce 1–2 kg of dry 
biomass per square meter of fi  eld area, which is about the same production as conventional crops 
such as alfalfa. Some of the most productive plants that grow in seawater have relatively unattractive 
names including glasswort, sea blite, saltbush, and salt grass. Though not producing grain, some of 
these plants produce abundant forage that can be eaten by animals. One small problem is that 
because of the high salt content of the forage, animals that consume it must drink signifi  cantly 
greater amounts of fresh water. One saltwater plant that has does produce abundant seeds is 
Salicornia bigelovii  that rapidly colonizes new mud fl  ats. With a salt content of <3%, the seeds are 
35% protein and 30% highly polyunsaturated oil, similar to saffl  ower oil in composition. The seeds 
contain bitter saponins, which somewhat limit the amount of seed or meal left after extracting oil 
that can be fed to animals. Especially for oil production, production of oil-producing algae in salt-
water ponds, such as those fi  lled with brackish groundwater, is a promising approach.
One of the greatest adverse effects of global warming results from the effects of high tempera-
tures on people, particularly the vulnerable elderly. This was illustrated tragically in Europe in The Endangered Global Atmosphere 365
August 2003. The highest temperatures ever recorded in the United Kingdom to that date occurred 
on August 10, 2003, with temperatures of 38°C (100.4°F) at London’s Heathrow airport and 38.1°C 
at Gravesend, Kent. Over 1000 people died from the heat wave in the United Kingdom. However, 
the greatest toll was in France where about 15,000 people, mostly elderly, died from the heat in 
August 2003. The problem was exacerbated by the fact that France is not used to extreme heat and 
the custom is for many people, including government ministers and physicians who would have 
been involved in remedial measures, to take August off for vacation. Funeral homes were over-
whelmed and refrigerated warehouses had to be used to store bodies until they could be identifi  ed 
and buried. A major concern was that the nuclear reactors that provide much of France’s electrical 
power could not be adequately cooled and in some cases their cooling had to be augmented by 
spraying with hoses. Other countries were adversely affected. Portugal lost 10% of its forests in for-
est fi res. On the positive side, the hot dry summer yielded grapes with very high sugar contents 
resulting in one of the best years ever for French wines. In the hot, dry summer of 2007, much of the 
forests in Greece were consumed by fi  re.
As global warming occurs, a major adaptation will need to be the installation of air conditioning 
and other cooling measures in regions of the world where air conditioning in homes and commercial 
buildings has been uncommon. This is particularly true in Europe where periods of hot weather will 
become more common, though of shorter duration than in much of the United States, for example. 
In addition to the installation of air conditioning, provision will need to be made to provide sustain-
able power for it. This could include a need for fuel turbine peaking facilities for electrical power 
generation and for greater reserves of cooling water for nuclear power reactors.
14.4 ACID RAIN
Precipitation made acidic by the presence of acids stronger than CO2(aq) is commonly called acid 
rain; the term applies to all kinds of acidic aqueous precipitation, including fog, dew, snow, and sleet.4 
In a more general sense, acid deposition  refers to the deposition on the earth’s surface of aqueous 
acids, acid gases (such as SO2), and acidic salts (such as NH4HSO4). According to this defi  nition, 
deposition in solution form is acid precipitation , and deposition of dry gases and compounds is dry 
deposition . Although carbon dioxide is present at higher levels in the atmosphere, sulfur dioxide, 
SO2, contributes more to the acidity of precipitation for two reasons. The fi  rst of these is that sulfur 
dioxide is signifi  cantly more soluble in water than is carbon dioxide, as indicated by its Henry’s law 
constant (Section 5.3) of 1.2 mol/L/atm compared to a value of 3.38  ¥ 10-2 mol/L/atm for CO2. 
Secondly, the value of Ka1 for SO2(aq),

 (14.8)
is more than four orders of magnitude higher than the value of 4.45  ¥ 10-7 for CO2.
Although acid rain can originate from the direct emission of strong acids, such as HCl gas or 
 sulfuric acid mist, most of it is a secondary air pollutant produced by the atmospheric oxidation 
of acid-forming gases such as the following, both shown as overall reactions consisting of several 
steps:
 +-++ O Æ +2 1
22 2 4 2 SO O H {2H SO }( ) aq (14.9)
 +-++ Æ +1
22 2 3 2 2NO O H O 2{H NO }( ) aq (14.10)366 Environmental Chemistry
Chemical reactions such as these play a dominant role in determining the nature, transport, and fate 
of acid precipitation. As the result of such reactions the chemical properties (acidity, ability to react 
with other substances) and physical properties (volatility, solubility) of acidic atmospheric pollutants 
are altered drastically. For example, even the small fraction of NO that does dissolve in water does 
not react signifi  cantly. However, its ultimate oxidation product, HNO3, though volatile, is highly 
water-soluble, strongly acidic, and very reactive with other materials. Therefore, it tends to be remo-
ved readily from the atmosphere and to do a great deal of harm to plants, corrodible materials, and 
other things that it contacts. 
Although emissions from industrial operations and fossil fuel combustion are the major sources 
of acid-forming gases, acid rain has also been encountered in areas far from such sources. This is 
due in part to the fact that acid-forming gases are oxidized to acidic constituents and deposited over 
several days, during which time the air mass containing the gas may have moved as much as several 
thousand kilometers. It is likely that the burning of biomass, such as is employed in “slash-and-
burn” agriculture, evolves the gases that lead to acid formation in more remote areas. In arid regions, 
dry acid gases or acids sorbed to particles may be deposited with effects similar to those of acid rain 
deposition.
Acid rain spreads out over areas of several hundred to several thousand kilometers. This classi-
fi es it as a regional  air pollution problem compared to a local  air pollution problem for smog and a 
global  one for ozone-destroying CFCs and greenhouse gases. Other examples of regional air pollu-
tion problems are those caused by soot, smoke, and fl  y ash from combustion sources and fi  res (forest 
fi res). Nuclear fallout from weapons testing or from reactor fi  res (of which, fortunately, there has 
been only one major one to date—the one at Chernobyl in the former Soviet Union) may also be 
regarded as a regional phenomenon.
Acid precipitation shows a strong geographic dependence, as illustrated in Figure 14.4, repre-
senting the pH of precipitation in the continental United States. The preponderance of acidic rainfall 
in the northeastern United States, which also affects southeastern Canada, is obvious. Analyses of 
the movements of air masses have shown a correlation between acid precipitation and prior move-
ment of an air mass over major sources of anthropogenic sulfur and nitrogen oxides emissions. This 
is particularly obvious in southern Scandinavia, which receives a heavy burden of air pollution from 
densely populated, heavily industrialized areas in Europe.

4.7The Endangered Global Atmosphere 367
Acid rain has been observed for well over a century, with many of the older observations from 
Great Britain. The fi  rst manifestations of this phenomenon were elevated levels of SO42- in precipi-
tation collected in industrialized areas. More modern evidence was obtained from analyses of pre-
cipitation in Sweden in the 1950s, and of U.S. precipitation a decade or so later. A vast research 
effort on acid rain was conducted in North America by the National Acid Precipitation Assessment 
Program, which resulted from the U.S. Acid Precipitation Act of 1980 and data are still being col-
lected as an outgrowth of this program.
Table 14.1 shows typical major cations and anions in pH-4.25 precipitation. Although actual 
values encountered vary greatly with time and location of collection, this table does show some major 
features of ionic solutes in precipitation. From the predominance of sulfate anion, it is apparent that 
sulfuric acid is the major contributor to acid precipitation. Nitric acid makes a smaller but growing 
contribution to the acid present. Hydrochloric acid ranks third.
Ample evidence exists of the damaging effects of acid rain. The major effects are the following:
Direct phytotoxicity to plants from excessive acid concentrations. (Evidence of direct or • 
indirect phytoxicity of acid rain is provided by the declining health of Eastern United 
States and Scandinavian forests and especially by damage to Germany’s Black Forest.)
Phytotoxicity from acid-forming gases, particularly SO• 2 and NO2, which accompany acid 
rain.
Indirect phytotoxicity. One of the most harmful effects of acidic precipitation is the dis-• 
solution of Al3+ from soil at levels that are harmful to plants.
Destruction of sensitive forests.• 
Respiratory effects on humans and other animals.• 
Acidifi  cation of lake water with toxic effects to Lake Flora and Fauna, especially fi  sh • 
fi ngerlings.
Corrosion of exposed structures, electrical relays, equipment, and ornamental materials. • 
Because of the effect of hydrogen ion:
 2H+ + CaCO3(s) Æ Ca2+ + CO2(g) + H2O
 Limestone, CaCO3, is especially susceptible to damage from acid rain.
Associated effects, such as reduction of visibility by sulfate aerosols and the infl  uence • 
of sulfate aerosols on physical and optical properties of clouds. (As mentioned in 
Section 14.2, intensifi  cation of cloud cover and changes in the optical properties of cloud

droplets—specifi  cally, increased refl  ectance of light—resulting from acid sulfate in the 
atmosphere may even have a mitigating effect on greenhouse warming of the atmosphere.) 
A signifi  cant association exists between acidic sulfate in the atmosphere and haziness.
Soil sensitivity to acid precipitation can be estimated from CEC (see Chapter 5). Soil is generally 
in s e n s i ti v e  if  fr ee  c ar b o n a t e s  ar e  p r e s e n t  o r  if  i t  i s  fl  ooded frequently. Soils with a CEC above 
15.4 meq/100 g (on the basis of the dry mass of soil) are also insensitive because the soil acts as a 
b u f f e r  b y  t a k i n g  u p  H+ ion. Soils with cation exchange capacities between 6.2 meq/100 g and 
15.4 meq/100 g are slightly sensitive. Soils with cation exchange capacities below 6.2 meq/100 g 
normally are sensitive if free carbonates are absent and the soil is not frequently fl  ooded.
Forms of precipitation other than rainfall may contain excess acidity. Acidic fog can be espe-
cially damaging because it is very penetrating. In early December 1982, Los Angeles experienced a 
severe, 2-day episode of acid fog. This fog consisted of a heavy concentration of acidic mist parti-
cles at ground level which reduced visibility and were very irritating to breathe. The pH of the water 
in these particles was 1.7, much lower than ever before recorded for acid precipitation. Another 
source of precipitation heavy in the ammonium, sulfate, and nitrate ions associated with atmo-
spheric acid is acid rime . Rime is frozen cloudwater which may condense on snowfl  akes or exposed 
surfaces. Rime constitutes up to 60% of the snowpack in some mountainous areas, and the deposi-
tion of acidic constituents with rime may be a signifi  cant v ector f or the transfer of acidic atmo-
spheric constituents to the Earth’s surface in some cases.
14.5 STRATOSPHERIC OZONE DESTRUCTION
Recall from Section 9.9 that stratospheric ozone, O3, serves as a shield to absorb harmful ultraviolet 
radiation in the stratosphere, protecting living beings on Earth from the effects of excessive amounts 
of such radiation. The two reactions by which stratospheric ozone is produced are
 O2 + hn Æ O + O ( l < 242.4 nm) (14.11)
 O + O2 + M Æ O3 + M (energy-absorbing N2 or O2) (14.12)
and it is destroyed by photodissociation
 O3 + hn Æ O2 + O ( l < 325 nm) (14.13)
and a series of reactions from which the net result is the following:
 O + O3 Æ 2O2 (14.14)
The concentration of ozone in the stratosphere is a steady-state concentration resulting from the 
balance of ozone production and destruction by the above processes. The region of the stratosphere 
in which signifi  cant amounts of ozone occur is called the ozone layer . The boundaries of the ozone 
layer vary with altitude, but it is generally regarded as extending from 15 to 35 km. At higher  altitudes 
above 35 km, the level of atmospheric gases is very low, most of the oxygen is dissociated to O atoms, 
and there is very little molecular O2 with which the O atoms can combine to produce O3. At lower 
altitudes below about 15 km, most of the short-wavelength ultraviolet radiation capable of producing 
O atoms required for ozone production has been fi  ltered from sunlight by the atmosphere above.
A total of about 350,000 metric tons of ozone are formed and destroyed daily in the ozone layer. 
Ozone never makes up more than a small fraction of the gases in the ozone layer. In fact, if the entire 
atmosphere’s ozone were averaged in a uniform layer at sea level at a temperature of 25°C and 1 atm 
pressure, it would be only 3 mm thick! This would represent an ozone layer of 0.3 atm-cm. The total 
amount of ozone in the atmosphere above a particular location is measured in Dobson units (DU). 
The DU is 0.001 atm-cm so the average ozone layer is about 300 DU.The Endangered Global Atmosphere 369
14.5.1  SHIELDING  EFFECT OF THE OZONE LAYER
Ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation very strongly in the region 220–330 nm. Therefore, it is effective 
in fi ltering out dangerous UV-B radiation, 290 nm < l <320 nm. (UV-A radiation, 320–400 nm, is 
relatively less harmful and UV-C radiation, <290 nm does not penetrate into the troposphere.) If 
UV-B were not absorbed by ozone, severe damage would result to exposed forms of life on Earth. 
Absorption of electromagnetic radiation by ozone converts the radiation’s energy to heat and is 
responsible for the temperature maximum encountered at the boundary between the stratosphere 
and the mesosphere at an altitude of approximately 50 km. The reason that the temperature maxi-
mum occurs at a higher altitude than that of the maximum ozone concentration arises from the fact 
that ozone is such an effective absorber of ultraviolet light, so that most of this radiation is absorbed 
in the upper stratosphere where it generates heat and only a small fraction reaches the lower altitu-
des, which remain relatively cool.
Increased intensities of ground-level ultraviolet radiation caused by stratospheric ozone destruction 
would have some signifi  cant adverse consequences. One major effect would be on plants, including 
crops used for food. The destruction of microscopic plants that are the basis of the ocean’s food chain 
(phytoplankton) could severely reduce the productivity of the world’s seas. Human exposure would 
result in an increased incidence of cataracts. The effect of most concern to humans is the elevated 
occurrence of skin cancer in individuals exposed to ultraviolet radiation. This is because of photo-
chemical reactions in cellular DNA (Chapter 22) that has absorbed UV-B radiation such that the 
genetic code is improperly translated during cell division leading to uncontrolled cell division and 
skin cancer. People with light complexions lack protective melanin, which absorbs UV-B radiation, 
and are especially susceptible to its effects. The most common type of skin cancer resulting from 
ultraviolet exposure is squamous cell carcinoma, which forms lesions that are readily removed and has 
little tendency to spread (metastasize). Readily metastasized malignant melanoma caused by absorp-
tion of UV-B radiation is often fatal. Fortunately, this form of skin cancer is relatively uncommon.
14.5.2  OZONE LAYER DESTRUCTION
One of the major threats to the environment is destruction of stratospheric ozone by substances 
released to the atmosphere that catalyze conversion of O3 back to O2. The major culprit in ozone 
depletion consists of CFC compounds, commonly known as “Freons.” In 1974 it was convincingly 
suggested by Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland that chlorofl  uoromethanes could catalyze the 
destruction of stratospheric ozone. Subsequent data on ozone levels in the stratosphere and on incre-
ased ultraviolet radiation at the earth’s surface showed that the threat to stratospheric ozone posed 
by CFCs is real. Along with atmospheric scientist Paul Crutzen, these investigators received a richly 
deserved Nobel Prize in 1995 for this classic work.
Developed in the 1930s as substitutes for hazardous sulfur dioxide and ammonia refrigerant 
fl uids, CFCs were used and released to a very large extent over several decades. In addition to their 
major use as refrigerant fl  uids, other applications have included solvents, aerosol propellants, and 
blowing agents in the fabrication of foam plastics. The same extreme chemical stability that makes 
CFCs nontoxic enables them to persist for years in the atmosphere and to enter the stratosphere. In 
the stratosphere, as discussed in Section 12.7, the photochemical dissociation of CFCs by intense 
ultraviolet radiation,
 CF2Cl2 + hn Æ Cl∑ + CClF2∑ (14.15)
yields chlorine atoms, each of which can go through chain reactions involving fi  rst the reaction of 
atomic chlorine with ozone:
 Cl∑ + O3 Æ ClO ∑ + O2 (14.16)370 Environmental Chemistry
In the most common sequence of reactions involved with stratospheric ozone destruction, the ClO∑ 
radicals react to form a dimer, which then reacts to regenerate Cl atoms, which in turn react with 
ozone to regenerate ClO∑ in the following cyclical reaction sequence (where M is an energy- absorbing 
third body, such as an N2 molecule):
 ClO∑ + ClO∑ Æ ClOOCl (14.17)
 ClOOCl + hn Æ ClOO∑ + Cl∑ (14.18)
 ClOO∑ + M Æ Cl∑ + O2 + M (14.19)
 2Cl∑ + 2O3 Æ 2ClO∑ + 2O2 (14.20)
 2O3 Æ 3O2 (net reaction) (14.21)
The net effect of these reactions is catalysis of the destruction of several thousand molecules of O3 
for each Cl atom produced. Because of their widespread use and persistency, the two CFCs of most 
concern in ozone destruction are CFC-11 and CFC-12, CFCl3, and CF2Cl2, respectively. Even in the 
intense ultraviolet radiation of the stratosphere, the most persistent CFCs have lifetimes of the order 
of 100 years.
The most prominent instance of ozone layer destruction is the so-called “Antarctic ozone hole” 
that was fi  rst noted in 1985 by the British Antarctic Survey and observed with great alarm in 
 subsequent years. (Re-examination of earlier data showed that the ozone hole had been ongoing 
for several years prior to 1985.) This phenomenon is manifested by the appearance of severely 
depleted stratospheric ozone (up to 50%) over the polar region during the Antarctic’s late winter and 
early spring months of September and October. The ozone hole is defi  ned by a boundary of 220 DU 
chosen because prior to 1979, no ozone measurements below 220 DU were observed.
Figure 14.5 shows the size and thickness of the Antarctic ozone hole in recent years. In the 
Southern Hemisphere spring of 2008, the hole in the stratospheric ozone layer reached the fi  fth larg-
est on record, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).5 
The 2008 ozone hole reached its maximum size on September 12, covering an area of 27.2 mil-
lion km2 and extending 6.5 km deep, according to NOAA. The record ozone hole was measured in 
2006, peaking at a size of 29.5 km2 million sq miles. Although the production of CFCs responsible 
for the Antarctic ozone hole has been offi  cially phased out, they persist for decades in the atmo-
sphere and may take several years to rise high in the atmosphere where their effects are felt. NOAA 
scientists estimate that full recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole may not occur until after 2050.
The reasons why the Antarctic ozone hole occurs is due to the formation of a unique cloud in 
the lower stratosphere when temperatures drop well below -70°C for several months in the winter 
(a similar thing happens in the Arctic, but to a much lesser extent). In the absence of sunlight in 
the winter, this cloud persists as a rapidly whirling vortex. It is composed largely of ice crystals 
and supercooled ternary mixtures of HNO3, HNO3·3H2O, H2SO4, and H2O. Also present is some 
HCl generated when CFCs undergo photochemical dissociation and abstract H from stratospheric 
CH4. This HCl and chlorine nitrate produced by the following reaction are unreactive in ozone 
destruction:
 ClO + NO2 Æ ClONO2 (14.22)
During the darkness of the Antarctic winter, Cl sequestered in the stratospheric cloud cover above 
Antarctica undergoes sequences of reactions that  produce accumulations of photochemically reac-
tive Cl2 and HOCl. During the winter, these species have no effect on ozone because of the absence The Endangered Global Atmosphere 371
of ultraviolet solar radiation from the sun required to produce Cl∑ atoms. Several important chemi-
cal processes are initiated on the surface of the stratospheric cloud particles which may be covered 
with a thin liquid aqueous layer. Chlorine nitrate may release HOCl:
 ClONO2 + H2O Æ HOCl + HNO3 (14.23)
Chlorine nitrate reacts in several steps with gaseous HCl to produce elemental chlorine and leads to 
an accumulation of photochemically reactive Cl2:
 ClONO2 + HCl Æ Cl2 + HNO3 (14.24)
Some Cl2 reacts with water to produce HOCl,
 Cl2 + H2O Æ HOCl + H+ + Cl- (14.25)
And some chloride from HCl reacts with HOCl to generate Cl2:
 Cl- + HOCl Æ Cl2 + OH- (14.26)
As sunlight returns to the lower stratosphere above Antarctica in spring, the Cl2 and the HOCl 
 produced by the reactions above undergo photodissociation,
 Cl2 + hn Æ 2Cl∑ (14.27)
 HOCl + hn Æ HO∑ + Cl∑ (14.28)
to produce Cl atoms that can undergo the sequence of chain reactions (Reactions 14.16 through 
14.20) leading to the net reaction for ozone destruction (Reaction 14.21). Therefore, over the winter FIGURE 14.5 The area and ozone density of the Antarctic ozone hole during the September/October period

level since then refl  ecting a worldwide ban on CFC manufacture. The lower plot illustrates the thickness of the

14.5.3  GREEN CHEMISTRY  SOLUTIONS  TO STRATOSPHERIC  OZONE DEPLETION
As discussed in Section 12.7, the U.S. EPA regulations, imposed in accordance with the 1986 
Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, curtailed the production of CFCs and 
halocarbons in the United States, starting in 1989. One of the most active areas of endeavor in green 
chemistry has been to fi  nd environmentally acceptable substitutes for ozone-depleting CFCs.
One of the easiest measures for CFC replacement was the application of carbon dioxide in pro-
ducing foams for polystyrene plastic foams used in packing, food containers, and insulation. Global 
production of polystyrene foam amounts to about 5 million metric tons each year. The volume (and 
waste disposal problems) with this material can be appreciated considering that the foam is about 
95% gas used as a blowing agent in making it. The Dow Chemical Company won the 1996 
Presidential Green Challenge Award for their development of a process to use carbon dioxide as a 
complete replacement for CFCs in making polystyrene foam. (The incremental addition of 
 greenhouse-gas carbon dioxide from this application is miniscule and CO2 by-product of processes 
such as fermentation to produce ethanol can be used for foam blowing.)
As noted in Chapter 12, the substitutes for CFCs have been hydrogen-containing chloro-
fl uorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrogen-containing fl  uorocarbons (HFCs), and some volatile hydrocar-
bon formulations. The presence of hydrogen in an H–C bond in these compounds provides a point 
of attack for hydroxyl radical to initiate compound decomposition in the troposphere. The fi  rst class 
of substitutes to be widely used was the HCFCs, which generally have only about 5% of the ozone-
depleting potential of CFCs. One of the most popular of these has been HCFC-22, chemical formula 
CHClF2, that was widely used in air conditioners, refrigerators, and as a foam blowing agent. Other 
popular HCFCs have included HCFC-142b (CH3CClF2, used as a refrigerant, often in a blend with 
HCFC-22), CHCl2CF3 (HCFC-123), CF3CHClF (HCFC-124), and CH3CCl2F (HCFC-141b). 
Although the HCFCs deplete stratospheric ozone much less than the CFCs, they still do so and 
are being phased out of general use. Ozone depletion potentials of CFC substitutes have been com-
piled that depend upon several factors including numbers of H–C bonds susceptible to attack and 
rate of reaction with HO∑ radical. Ozone depletion potentials are expressed relative to a value of 1.0 
for CFC-11, a non-hydrogen-containing CFC with a formula of CFCl3, which is particularly destruc-
tive to ozone because of its long atmospheric lifetime and high Cl content. Low ozone depletion 
potential correlates with short tropospheric lifetime, which means that the compound is destroyed 
in the troposphere before migrating to the stratosphere. The ozone-depletion potentials of some 
HCFC compounds that have been used as substitutes for CFCs are HCFC-22, 0.030; HCFC-123, 
0.013; HCFC-141b, 0.10; HCFC-124, 0.035; and HCFC-142b, 0.038. 
A kind of CFC substitute that does not harm stratospheric ozone consists of HFCs. These have 
included CH2FCF3 (HFC-134a, 1,1,1,2-tetrafl  uoroethane, which became the standard substitute for 
CFC-12 in automobile air conditioners and refrigeration equipment) and CH2F2 (HFC-152a, a fl  am-
mable material). These compounds not only contain the more readily broken H–C bonds, they are 
chlorine-free and cannot generate the Cl atoms that attack stratospheric ozone. HFCs are favored as 
CFC replacements in North America. There is some concern over their global warming potential 
and, particularly in the case of popular HFC-134a, their potential to generate toxic fl  uoroacetic acid 
degradation products.
Arguably the most environmentally benign CFC substitutes are low-molecular-mass hydrocar-
bons including cyclopentane and isobutane. First used as refrigerants in 1867 and favored along with 
ammonia for this purpose until CFCs were developed in the 1930s, volatile hydrocarbons are now 
banned from use as home refrigerants in the United States because of their fl  ammability, but are 
favored in Europe and other parts of the world.The Endangered Global Atmosphere 373
14.6 ATMOSPHERIC BROWN CLOUDS
In Chapter 13, photochemical smog was discussed largely as a regional problem affecting large 
urban areas such as the one in the Los Angeles Basin. Smog is actually part of a larger problem that 
the United Nations Environment Programme defi  ned in November 2008 as the Atmospheric Brown 
Cloud.6 Generated by sources including automobiles, coal-fi  red power plants, slash-and burn agri-
culture, and cooking over fi  res fueled by wood or dung, the brown cloud consists of a layer of pol-
luted air approximately 3 km thick that extends from the Arabian Peninsula across China and the 
western Pacifi  c Ocean, at times even touching on the west coast of the United States Laden with 
soot and other particles, noxious air pollutants including ozone and greenhouse gases, the cloud is 
now recognized to have many adverse effects including the darkening of megacities such as 
New Delhi and Beijing, increased melting of Himalayan glaciers, decreased agricultural productivity, 
and greater extremes in weather events. Increased melting of the Hindu Kush–Himalayan–Tibetan 
glaciers is a particular concern because they provide head-waters for most Asian rivers that provide 
water to hundreds of millions of people as well as irrigation water essential to the production of rice 
and other crops. Because of its content of sunlight-refl  ecting sulfates and other particles, the cloud 
may be masking greenhouse warming of affected areas by 20–80%.
A major cause of the brown cloud phenomenon is ineffi  cient, unsustainable burning of fossil 
fuels, particularly coal, but also including biomass. Deforestation, including burning of forest resi-
dues, also contributes. 
The brown cloud has been studied most intensively in Asia because the region contains about 
half of the world’s population, has undergone very rapid economic growth in recent years, and has 
a variable climate including annual monsoons. However, similar brown clouds occur in parts of 
Europe, North America, southern Africa, and the Amazon Basin. The severities of brown cloud 
events that occur in the North American eastern seaboard and Europe are reduced by winter pre-
cipitation, which wash pollutants out of the sky. The United Nations report identifi  es the following 
several regional brown cloud hotspots of most crucial concern:
East Asia, a region covering eastern China• 
The southeast Asian countries of Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam• 
The Indo-Gangetic plains extending from eastern Pakistan across India to Bangladesh • 
and Myanmar
The southeast Asian region of Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam• 
The sub-Saharan region of Africa extending into Angola, Zambia, and Zimbabwe• 
The South American Amazon Basin region• 
At least 13 megacities in Asia and Africa: Bangkok, Beijing, Cairo, Dhaka, Karachi, • 
Kolkata, Lagos, Mumbai, New Delhi, Seoul, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Tehran
The particles in brown clouds have two major effects. Sulfates, including sulfuric acid droplets 
and ammonium sulfates, largely from burning coal, scatter sunlight and refl  ect it back into space. 
Black soot and carbon particles from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels absorb incoming sun-
light. These phenomena have a light-dimming effect, particularly in urban areas. India as a whole 
has noted light dimming of about 2% per decade since 1960 and China has experienced dimming 
of 3–4% since the 1950s; in both countries the effect has become more pronounced since 1980. 
Dimming of 10–25% has been noted in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Karachi, and New Delhi. 
Brown cloud particles may also contribute to increased cloud cover from condensation of atmo-
spheric water vapor to small cloud droplets, further increasing the dimming effect.
The dimming effects of brown clouds result in cooling of affected areas. Some climatologists 
believe that this masks the greenhouse gas warming of affected areas by 20–80%. This leads to the 
interesting conclusion that abrupt elimination of brown cloud pollution (a very unlikely event) could 374 Environmental Chemistry
trigger warming of affected areas by about 2°C, which would adversely affect climate. Overall, 
temperature patterns in India, China, and surrounding areas have exhibited complex behavior dur-
ing recent decades with warming in some places and cooling in others, which may well be the result 
of the infl  uence of the brown clouds.
A particular concern regarding the potential effects of the brown cloud has to do with its infl  u-
ence on Asian monsoons, which are crucial to food production in the region. Several trends in Asian 
monsoons and rainfall have been observed in recent years which may be infl  uenced by the brown 
cloud phenomenon. Since the 1950s, monsoon precipitation over India and southeast Asia has 
decreased 5–7% and the Indian summer monsoon has experienced fewer rainy days. Extreme rain 
events of more than 10 cm have increased in both China and India and very heavy rainfalls of more 
than 15 cm per day have nearly doubled.
A particular concern has been the potential infl  uence of the brown cloud on glaciers. The most 
important of these in Asia has been the Hindu Kush–Himalayan–Tibetan glaciers that compose the 
head-waters of the Brahmaputra, Ganges, Mekong, and Yangtze rivers. With a population of more 
than 400 million people, India’s Ganges basin contains 40% of India’s irrigated farmland, so water 
input to the Ganges river from glacial sources is crucially important. About 70% of Ganges river 
water comes from the Gangotri glacier. China’s 47,000 glaciers have decreased by about 5% and 
3000 km2 since 1980. Deposition of black carbon on glacier surfaces has increased light absorption 
and accelerated melting.
The brown cloud is likely having signifi  cant effects on agriculture and food production including 
the key food crops of rice, wheat, corn, and soybeans. Ground-level ozone above 40 parts per billion 
is believed to reduce crop production. Such levels are reached in parts of Asia, peaking during 
February to June and again between September and November, reducing yields of wheat, rice, and 
legumes. Other adverse brown cloud effects on crop production come from deposition of acidic and 
toxic particles on plants and reduced photosynthesis due to dimming of sunlight that reaches the 
earth’s surface.
Several important health effects could be caused by brown clouds especially by particles smaller 
than 2.5 μm (PM2.5 discussed in Section 10.9). Toxic substances including carcinogens are inhaled 
with air in brown clouds. Brown cloud air pollutants are linked to respiratory disease and cardiovas-
cular disease. Hundreds of thousands of premature deaths in countries affected by the brown cloud 
may be due to inhalation of smoke particles from indoor cooking fi  res fueled by wood, coal, and 
even dried animal dung.
14.6.1  YELLOW  DUST
Closely tied to the brown cloud, yellow dust  consists of huge masses of windblown dust and sand 
that affl  ict parts of the world each year. The most common yellow dust phenomenon begins with 
winds over deserts in Mongolia and China spreading east across China and affecting the Korean 
peninsula, J apan, and e v en Russia ’ s Pacifi  c port of Vladi v ostok. In i ts mo v ement across China ’ s 
industrial areas, the yellow dust mixes with the brown cloud of air pollutants to produce a highly 
noxious brew of very unpleasant air. Yellow dust is most prevalent in China from March until May. 
Deforestation and desertifi  cation, probably aggravated by global warming are contributing to the 
yellow dust phenomenon.
The economic damage from yellow dust amounts to millions of dollars each year. Manufacturers 
of high-tech goods that require clean environments are especially affl  icted. The human costs are 
quite high with increased occurrence of asthma, lung disease, and immune diseases.
In contrast to the damaging dust storms that affl  ict southeast Asia, dust storms that originate in 
Africa’s Sahara desert are thought to be important in sustaining life in some other parts of the 
world. About half of the Saharan dust comes from a small region called the Bodele Depression 
where a gap between the Tibesti and Ennedi mountains forms a natural wind tunnel through which 
winds blow across the Bodele Depression picking up an average of 700,000 metric tons of dust in a The Endangered Global Atmosphere 375
day. Easterly trade winds blow this dust across the Atlantic Ocean, depositing about 40 million tons 
of dust each year onto the Amazon region of South America. This dust is a signifi  cant source of 
nutrients for the Amazon forests helping to counteract the strong leaching effect of heavy rainfall in 
these regions. Much of the Saharan dust is deposited in the Atlantic Ocean as it is carried toward 
South America where it fertilizes the phytoplankton organisms that form the base of the oceanic 
food chain. Ocean water tends to be iron-defi  cient and it is believed that the Saharan dust replen-
ishes nutrient iron in regions of the Atlantic where it is deposited.
14.7 ATMOSPHERIC DAMAGE BY PHOTOCHEMICAL SMOG
Photochemical smog, an air pollution phenomenon discussed in Chapter 13, is a signifi  cant con-
tributor to the brown cloud discussed above. It occurs in urban areas where the combination of 
pollution-forming emissions and appropriate atmospheric conditions are right for its formation. 
In order for high levels of smog to form, relatively stagnant air must be subjected to sunlight under 
low humidity conditions in the presence of pollutant nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons. The auto-
mobile is a major source of these pollutants, but hydrocarbons may come from biogenic sources, 
of which a-pinene and isoprene from trees are the most abundant (see Section 12.2). Under smog-
forming conditions, the urban atmosphere acts as a huge chemical reactor in which hydrocarbons, 
nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and oxygen undergo reactions driven by sunlight to produce ozone, 
organic oxidants, aldehydes, organic particles, nitrates, sulfates, and other noxious products. 
Smog does pose signifi  cant hazards to living things and materials in local urban areas in which 
millions of people are exposed and the oxidants generated by it have detrimental effects on 
crop production.
Ironically, ozone, which serves an essential protective function in the stratosphere, is the major 
culprit in tropospheric smog. In fact, surface ozone levels are used as a measure of smog. Ozone’s 
phytotoxicity raises particular concern with respect to trees and crops. Ozone is the smog constitu-
ent responsible for most of the respiratory system distress and eye irritation, characteristic of human 
exposure to smog. Breathing is impaired at ozone levels approaching only about 0.1 ppm. Ozone is 
the “criterion” air pollutant that has been most resistant to control measures. Because of its strongly 
oxidizing nature, ozone attacks unsaturated bonds in fatty acid constituents of cell membranes. 
Other oxidants, such as PAN (Section 13.4), also contribute to the toxicity of smog, as do aldehydes 
produced as reactive intermediates in smog formation.
Smog is a secondary air pollutant that forms some time after and some distance from the injec-
tion into the atmosphere of the primary pollutant nitrogen oxides and reactive hydrocarbons required 
for its formation. The U.S. EPA’s Empirical Kinetic Modeling Approach uses the concept of an air 
parcel  to model smog formation. This model utilizes the concept of a “parcel” of relatively unpol-
luted air moving across an urban area in which it becomes contaminated with smog-forming gases. 
When the upper boundary of this parcel is restricted to about 1000 m by a temperature inversion and 
subjected to sunlight, the primary pollutants react to form smog in a system that involves photo-
chemical reaction processes, transport, mixing, and dilution. As the hydrocarbons are consumed by 
photochemical oxidation processes in the air, and as nitrogen oxides are removed as nitrates and 
nitric acid (especially at nighttime), ozone levels reach a peak concentration at a time and place that 
may be some distance removed from the source of pollutants.
The most visible manifestation of smog is the urban aerosol , which greatly reduces visibility in 
smoggy urban atmospheres and contributes to the brown cloud phenomenon. Many of the particles 
composing this aerosol are condensation aerosols made from gases by chemical processes (see 
Chapter 10) and are therefore quite small, usually less than 2 μm. Particles of such a size are espe-
cially harmful because they scatter light most effi  ciently and are the most respirable. Aerosol par-
ticles formed from smog often contain toxic constituents, such as respiratory tract irritants and 
mutagens. The urban aerosol also contains particle constituents that originate from processes other 376 Environmental Chemistry
than smog formation. Oxidation of pollutant sulfur dioxide by the strongly oxidizing conditions of 
photochemical smog,
 1
22 2 2 4 2 SO O H O H SO ++ Æ (overall process) (14.29)
produces sulfuric acid and sulfate particles. Nitric acid and nitrates are produced at night when 
sunlight is absent, a process that involves intermediate NO3 radical:
 O3 + NO2 Æ O2 + NO3 (14.30)
 NO3 + NO2 +  M (energy-absorbing third body) Æ N2O5 + M (14.31)
 N2O5 + H2O Æ 2HNO3 (14.32)
 HNO3 + NH3 Æ NH4NO3 (14.33)
As indicated by the last reaction above, ammonium salts are common constituents of urban aero-
sol particles; they tend to be particularly corrosive. Metals, which may contribute to the toxicity of 
urban aerosol particles and which may catalyze reactions on their surfaces, occur in the particles. 
Water is always present, even in low humidity atmospheres, and is usually present in urban aerosol 
particles. Carbon and PAHs from partial combustion and diesel engine emissions are usually abun-
dant constituents; elemental carbon is usually the particulate constituent most responsible for 
absorbing light in the urban aerosol. If the air parcel originates over the ocean, it contains sea salt 
particles consisting largely of NaCl, from which some of the chloride may be lost as volatile HCl by

Na2SO4 and NaNO3 found in the urban aerosol.
PAHs (see Section 10.8), are among the urban aerosol particle constituents of most concern, 
particularly because metabolites of some of these compounds (see the 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide of 
benzo(a)pyrene in Figure 23.3) are carcinogenic. PAHs include unsubstituted compounds as well as 
those with alkyl, oxygen, or nitrogen substituents, or O or N hetero atoms:
Benzo(j)fluoranthene 3-Nitroperylene (mutagenic)NO2
These kinds of compounds are emitted by internal combustion engine exhausts and occur in both 
the gas and particulate phases. Numerous mechanisms exist for their destruction and chemical 
alteration, particularly reaction with oxidant species—HO∑, O3, NO2, N2O5, and HNO3. Direct 
 photolysis is also possible. PAH compounds in the vapor phase are destroyed relatively rapidly by 
these means, whereas PAHs sorbed to particles are much more resistant to reaction.
Another kind of urban aerosol particulate matter of considerable concern is acid fog , which may 
have pH values below 2 due to the presence of H2SO4 or HNO3. Acid fog formation covers a wide 
range of atmospheric chemical and physical phenomena. The gas-phase oxidation of SO2 and NO 
produces strong acids, which form very small aerosol particles. These, in turn, act as condensation 
nuclei for water vapor. Acid–base phenomena occur in the droplets, and the droplets act as scaven-
gers to remove ionic species from air. Because fog aerosol particles form in areas of intense acid gas 
pollution near the surface, the concentrations of acids and ionic species in fog aerosol droplets tend 
to be much higher than in cloud aerosol droplets at higher altitudes.The Endangered Global Atmosphere 377
In addition to health effects and damage to materials, one of the greater problems caused by 
smog is the destruction of crops and the reduction of crop yields. The annual cost of these effects in 
California alone is several billion dollars.
Even lightly populated nonindustrial areas are subject to the effects of smog brought about by 
human activities. Particularly, the practice of burning savanna grasses for agricultural purposes 
causes smog. This burning produces NOx and reactive hydrocarbons that are required for smog 
formation. Furthermore, these grasses grow in tropical regions which have the intense sunlight 
required for smog formation. The net result is the rapid development of smoggy conditions as mani-
fested by ozone levels several times normal background values.
Since about 1970, signifi  cant progress has been made in eliminating the emissions of organic 
compounds and NOx that cause smog formation. These efforts resulted in a less-than-anticipated 
reduction in smog; for example, urban ozone in the United States declined only about 8% during the 
1980s. In an effort to reduce ozone and other manifestations of air pollution more rapidly, the U.S. 
Congress passed a new, more rigorous set of Clean Air Act Amendments in 1990. The Amendments 
were written to further reduce automotive exhaust emissions, require changes in automotive fuel 
formulations, reduce emissions from stationary sources, and mandate other changes designed to 
reduce photochemical smog and other forms of air pollution. As a result of the enforcement of 
 regulations under the Clean Air Act and technological advances, particularly in the area of automo-
bile emissions, substantial progress has been made in controlling smog in the United States since 
the early 1990s.
14.8 NUCLEAR WINTER
Nuclear winter  is a term used to describe a catastrophic atmospheric effect that might occur after a 
massive exchange of nuclear fi  repower between major powers as well as natural phenomena, parti-
cularly huge volcanic eruptions and asteroid impact, which would have much the same effect. The 
heat from the nuclear blasts and from resulting fi  res would cause powerful updrafts carrying sooty 
combustion products to stratospheric regions. This would result in several years of much lower 
 temperatures and freezing temperatures even during summertime. There are several reasons for 
such an effect. First of all, the highly absorbent, largely black particulate matter would absorb solar 
radiation high in the atmosphere so that it would not reach the earth’s surface. Cooling would also 
occur from a phenomenon opposite to that of the greenhouse effect. That is because outgoing infra-
red radiation from particles high in the atmosphere would have to penetrate relatively much less into 
the atmosphere and, therefore, would be exposed to much less infrared-absorbing water vapor and 
 carbon dioxide gas. This would deprive the lower atmosphere of the warming effect of outgoing 
infrared radiation and would mean that less infrared would be re-radiated from the atmosphere back 
to the earth’s surface. The cooling would also inhibit the evaporation of water, thereby reducing the 
amount of infrared-absorbing water vapor in the atmosphere and slowing the process by which 
particulate matter is scavenged from the atmosphere by rain. In addition to the direct suffering 
 caused, starv ati on o f milli ons o f peop l e w oul d resul t from crop f ail ures accompan yin g y ears o f 
nuclear winter. 
Conditions similar to those of a nuclear winter have resulted from huge volcanic eruptions. One 
of these occurred in 1816, “the year without a summer,” following the astoundingly enormous 
Tambora, the Indonesian volcanic explosion of 1815. Brutally cold years around 210 BC that fol-
lowed a similar volcanic incident in Iceland were recorded in ancient China. The June 1991 explo-
sion of the Philippine volcano Pinatubo, which blasted millions of tons of material into the 
atmosphere, resulted in an approximately 0.5°C cooling the following year. The greatest climatic 
effects of volcanoes result from emission of millions of tons of sulfur gases into the atmosphere, 
which produce sunlight-refl  ecting sulfuric acid aerosols and sulfate particles. The pronounced cool-
ing effect of the Pinatubo volcano was mainly due to the 15–30 million tons of sulfur dioxide that it 
emitted to the atmosphere. Eruptions near the equator cause global events whereas those at higher 378 Environmental Chemistry
latitudes affect the hemisphere in which they occur. The volcanic incidents cited above clearly illus-
trate the climatic effects of huge quantities of particulate matter ejected high into the atmosphere. 
And it will happen again, perhaps on a scale that will dwarf even the Tambora eruption. Massive 
destructive eruptions can occur with supervolcanoes, one of the largest of which is the Yellowstone 
volcano in the United States. With a caldera about 50 km in diameter, another major eruption of this 
volcano could well occur again. An article entitled “Is the ‘Beast’ Building to a Violent Tantrum?” 
states the following: “When the volcano in Yellowstone National Park blew 6,400 centuries ago, it 
obliterated a mountain range, felled herds of prehistoric camels hundreds of miles away, and left a 
smoking hole in the ground the size of the Los Angeles Basin.”7 Such an event could well extinguish 
civilization on Earth.
Evidence exists to suggest that military explosives can result in the introduction of large quanti-
ties of particulate matter into the atmosphere. For example, carpet bombings of cities, such as the 
tragic bombing of Dresden, Germany, near the end of World War II, have produced huge fi  restorms 
that created their own wind causing a particle-laden updraft into the atmosphere. Of course, the 
effect of a full-scale nuclear exchange would be manyfold higher.
An idea of the potential climatic effect resulting from a full-scale nuclear exchange may be 
obtained by considering the magnitude of the blasts that might be involved. Only two nuclear bombs 
have been used in warfare, both dropped on cities in Japan in 1945. The Hiroshima fi  ssion bomb 
had the explosive force of 12 kilotons of Trinitrotoluene (TNT) explosive. Its blast, fi  reball, and 
instantaneous emissions of neutrons and gamma radiation, followed by fi  res and exposure to radio-
active fi  ssion products, killed about 100,000 people and destroyed the city on which it was dropped. 
In comparison with this 12-kiloton bomb, modern fusion bombs are typically rated at 500 kilotons, 
and 10-megaton weapons are common. A full-scale nuclear exchange might involve a total of 
the order of 5000 megatons of nuclear explosives. As a result, unimaginable quantities of soot 
from the partial combustion of wood, plastics, paving asphalt, petroleum, forests, and other combus-
tibles would be carried to the stratosphere. At such high altitudes, tropospheric removal mecha-
nisms for particles are not effective because there is not enough water in the stratosphere to produce 
rainfall to wash particles from the air, and convection processes are very limited. Much of the 
 particulate matter would be in the micrometer size range in which light is refl  ected, scattered, and 
absorbed most effectively and settling is very slow. Therefore, vast areas of Earth would be overlain 
by a stable cloud of particles and the fraction of sunlight reaching the earth’s surface would be 
 drastically reduced, resulting in a dramatic cooling effect. There would be other effects as well. 
The extreme heat and pressure in the fi  reball would result in the fi  x a t i o n  o f  n i t r o g e n  b y  t h e  
following reaction:
 O2 + N2 Æ 2NO (14.34)
The large quantities of NO generated would catalyze the destruction of protective stratospheric 
ozone.
The timing and location of nuclear blasts are very important in determining their climatic effects. 
Atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, including a 58-megaton monster detonated by the Soviet 
Union, has had little atmospheric effect. Such tests were carried out at widely spaced intervals on 
deserts, small tropical islands, and other locations with minimal combustible matter. In contrast, 
military use of nuclear weapons would involve a high concentration of fi  repower, both in time and 
in space, on industrial and military targets consisting largely of combustibles. Furthermore, destruc-
tion of hardened military sites requires blasts that disrupt large quantities of soil, rock, and concrete, 
which are pulverized, vaporized, and blown into the atmosphere.
On a hopeful note, the East–West confl  ict that dominated world politics and threatened nuclear 
war from the mid-1900s until 1990 has now abated and the probability of nuclear warfare seems to 
have diminished. However, continued armed confl  ict in the Middle East, tense relations between 
nuclear-armed India and Pakistan, efforts by potentially unstable countries to acquire nuclear The Endangered Global Atmosphere 379
 weapons, racial hatred accompanied by a determination to perform “ethnic cleansing,” and a “trig-
ger-happy” state of mind among even educated people who should know better still give cause for 
concern with respect to the prospect of “nuclear winter.”
14.8.1  DOOMSDAY  VISITORS  FROM SPACE
Of all the possible atmospheric catastrophes that can occur, arguably the most threatening would be 
one caused by the collision of a large asteroid with Earth. Convincing evidence now exists that mass 
extinctions of species in the past have resulted from Earth being hit by asteroids several kilometers 
in diameter. It is well established that the impact of a huge asteroid caused the extinction of dino-
saurs and most other animal species 66 million years ago. Fossil evidence suggests that even greater 
extinctions that occurred millions of years earlier, including one that destroyed about 90% of all 
living species 251 million years ago, were probably the result of asteroid impact. Such an impact 
would cause much the same effects as those from “nuclear winter,” though with a large asteroid, the 
effects would be much more pronounced.
Around 13,000 years ago, Earth was just emerging from the most recent Ice Age when it reverted 
to a cold period lasting for 1300 years called the Younger Dryas or “Big Freeze.”8 As a result, about 
35 animal species including several large mammals such as the short-faced bear, American lion, 
and mastodons became extinct. Geologically, the beginning of the Younger Dryas is marked by a 
thin black layer of carbon indicative of massive fi  res, probably from burning forests. It is possible 
that this catastrophic event was caused by the impact of a large comet that rained large numbers of 
meteorites over the earth’s surface. The discovery of very small diamonds (“nanodiamonds”) in the 
black layer is indicative of such an event. 
14.9 WHAT IS TO BE DONE?
Of all environmental hazards, there is little doubt that major disruptions in the atmosphere and 
 climate have the greatest potential for catastrophic and irreversible environmental damage. If levels 
of greenhouse gases and reactive trace gases continue to increase at present rates, major environ-
mental effects are virtually certain. On a hopeful note, the bulk of these emissions arise from indu-
strialized nations which, in principle, can apply the resources needed to reduce them substantially. 
The best example to date has been the 1987 “Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the 
Ozone Layer,” an international treaty through which a large number of nations agreed to cut CFC 
emissions by 50% by the year 2000. This agreement and subsequent ones, particularly the 
Copenhagen Amendment of 1992, may pave the way for more encompassing agreements covering 
carbon dioxide and other trace gases.
More ominous, however, is the combination of population pressure and desire for better living 
standards on a global basis. Consider, for example, the demand that these two factors place on energy 
resources and the environmental disruption that may result. In many highly populated developing 
nations, high-sulfur coal is the most readily available, cheapest source of energy. It is understand-
ably diffi  cult to persuade populations faced with real hunger to forego short-term economic gain for 
the sake of long-term environmental quality. Destruction of rain forests by “slash-and-burn” agri-
cultural methods does seem to make economic sense to those engaged in subsistence farming to 
obtain badly needed hard currency, which can be earned by converting forest to pasture land and 
exporting fast-food-hamburger beef to wealthier nations.
What is to be done? First of all, it is important to keep in mind that the atmosphere has a strong 
ability to cleanse itself of pollutant species. Water-soluble gases, including greenhouse-gas CO2, 
acid-gas SO2, and fi  ne particulate matter are removed with precipitation. For most gaseous contami-
nants, oxidation precedes or accompanies removal processes. To a degree, oxidation is carried out 
by O3. To a larger extent, the most active atmospheric oxidant is hydroxyl radical HO∑. As illustrated 
in Figure 9.10, this atmospheric scavenger species reacts with all important trace gas species except 380 Environmental Chemistry
for CO2 and CFCs. It is now generally recognized that HO∑ is an almost uni v ersal atmospheri c 
cleansing agent. Given this crucial role of HO∑ radical, any pollutants that substantially reduce its 
concentration in the atmosphere are potentially troublesome. One concern over carbon monoxide 
emissions to the atmosphere is the reactivity of HO∑ with CO,
 CO + HO∑ Æ CO2 + H (14.35)
which could result in removal of HO∑ from the atmosphere.
Of all the major threats to the global climate, it is virtually certain that humankind will have to 
try to cope with greenhouse warming and the climatic effects thereof. The measures to be taken in 
dealing with this problem fall into the three following categories:
Minimization•  by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, switching to alternate energy 
sources, increasing energy conservation, and reversing deforestation. It is especially sen-
sible to use measures that have major benefi  ts in addition to reduction of greenhouse warm-
ing. Such measures include, as examples, reforestation, restoration of grasslands, increased 
energy conservation, and a massive shift to solar and wind energy sources.
Counteracting measures• , such as injecting light-refl  ecting particles into the upper 
atmosphere.
Adaptation• , particularly through increased effi  ciency and fl  exibility of the distribution 
and use of water, which might be in very short supply in many parts of the world as a 
 consequence of greenhouse warming. Important examples are implementation of more 
effi cient irrigation practices and changes in agriculture to grow crops that require less irri-
gation. Emphasis on adaptation is favored by those who contend that not enough is known 
about the types and severity of global warming to justify massive expenditures on minimi-
zation and counteractive measures. In any case, adaptation will certainly have to be 
employed as a means of coping with global warming.
Potentially, tax strategy can be very effective in reducing the use of carbonaceous fuels and 
greenhouse CO2 emissions. This is the rationale behind the carbon tax , which is tied with the car-
bon content of various fuels. Another option is to dispose off carbon dioxide to a sink other than the 
atmosphere. The most obvious such sink is the ocean; other possibilities are deep subterranean 
aquifers and exhausted oil and gas wells.
A common measure taken against the effects of another atmospheric hazard, ultraviolet radia-
tion, provides an example of adaptation. This measure is the use of sunscreens placed on the skin as 
lotions to fi  lter out UV-B and in some formulations UV-A radiation, thus reducing the likelihood of 
skin cancer. The active ingredient of sunscreen must absorb or refl  ect ultraviolet light effectively. 
Suspensions of small particles of zinc oxide or titanium oxide are used in sunscreen formulations as 
physical blockers of ultraviolet radiation. Water-insoluble suspensions of organic octinoxate (octyl 
methoxycinnamate) absorb UV-B radiation and oxybenzone is effective against UV-A radiation (see 
structural formulas below). These and related compounds act as chemical absorbers, which are 
generally aromatic compounds conjugated with a carbonyl group. Chemical absorbers normally act 
by absorbing ultraviolet radiation to reach an excited state and then dissipating the absorbed energy 
by reverting to the ground state to regenerate the absorbing species.

The “ tie-in strategy ,” sometimes called the “no-regrets” policy, has been proposed as a sensible 
approach to dealing with the kinds of global environmental problems discussed in this chapter. This 
approach was fi  rst enunciated in 1980.9 It advocates taking measures consisting of “high-leverage 
actions,” which are designed to prevent problems from occurring, which improve resiliency and 
adaptability, and which have substantial merit even if the major problems that they are designed to 
avoid do not materialize. An example is implementation of environmentally sound substitutes for 
fossil fuels to lower atmospheric CO2 output and prevent greenhouse warming. Even if it turns out 
that the greenhouse effect is exaggerated, such substitutes would save Earth from other kinds of 
environmental damage, such as disruption of land by strip mining coal or preventing oil spills from 
petroleum transport. Defi  nite economic and political benefi  t s  w o u l d  a l s o  a c c r u e  f r o m  l e s s e n e d  
dependence on uncertain, volatile petroleum supplies. Increased energy effi  ciency would diminish 
both greenhouse gas and acid rain production, while lowering costs of production and reducing the 
need for expensive and environmentally disruptive new power plants. 
Even when changes such as in climate are inevitable, measures that slow the changes are 
 desirable because adaptation is usually much more feasible over longer time periods. The imple-
mentation of tie-in strategies requires some degree of incentive beyond normal market forces and, 
therefore, is opposed by some on ideological grounds. A good example is opposition to mandatory 
fuel mileage standards for automobiles. Although free market purists tend to oppose measures 
such as fuel mileage standards, a market that does not factor in environmental costs is not truly a 
free market.

Geochemistry
15.1 INTRODUCTION
The geosphere , or solid earth, is that part of Earth upon which humans live and from which humans 
extract most of their food, minerals, and fuels. Once thought to have an almost unlimited buffering 
capacity against the perturbations of humankind, the geosphere is now known to be rather fragile 
and subject to harm from human activities. For example, some billions of tons of earth material are 
mined or otherwise disturbed each year in the extraction of minerals and coal. Two atmospheric 
pollutant phenomena—excess carbon dioxide and acid rain (see Chapter 14)—have the potential to 
cause major changes in the geosphere. Too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may cause global 
 heating (“greenhouse effect”), which could signifi  cantly alter rainfall patterns and turn currently 
productive areas of Earth into desert regions. The low pH characteristic of acid rain can bring about 
drastic changes in the solubilities and oxidation–reduction rates of minerals. Erosion caused by 
intensive cultivation of land is washing away vast quantities of topsoil from fertile farmlands each 
year. In some areas of industrialized countries, the geosphere has been the dumping ground for 
toxic chemicals. Ultimately, the geosphere must provide disposal sites for the nuclear wastes of the 
more than 400 nuclear reactors that have operated worldwide. It may be readily seen that the pre-
servation of the geosphere in a form suitable for human habitation is one of the greatest challenges 
facing humankind.
The interface between the geosphere and the atmosphere at the Earth’s surface is very impor-
tant to the environment. Human activities on the Earth’s surface may affect climate, most directly 
through the change of surface albedo, defi  ned as the percentage of incident solar radiation refl  ected 
by a land or water surface. For example, if the sun radiates 100 units of energy per minute to the 
outer limits of the atmosphere, and the Earth’s surface receives 60 units per minute of the total, 
then refl  ects 30 units upward, the albedo is 50%. Some typical albedo values for different areas on 
the Earth’s surface are: evergreen forests, 7 -15%; dry , plowed fi  elds, 10 -15%; deserts, 25 -35%; 
fresh snow, 85 -90%; asphalt, 8%. In some heavily developed areas, anthropogenic (human- 
produced) heat release is comparable to the solar input. The anthropogenic energy release over the 
60 km2 of Manhattan Island averages about four times the solar energy falling on the area; over the 
3500 km2 of Los Angeles the anthropogenic energy release is about 13% of the solar fl  ux.
One of the greatest impacts of humans on the geosphere is the creation of desert areas through 
abuse of land with marginal amounts of rainfall. This process, called desertifi  cation , is manifested 
by declining groundwater tables, salinization of topsoil and water, reduction of surface waters, 
unnaturally high soil erosion, and desolation of native vegetation. The problem is severe in some 
parts of the world, particularly Africa’s Sahel (southern rim of the Sahara), where the Sahara 
advanced southward at a particularly rapid rate during the period 1968–1973, contributing to wide-
spread starvation in Africa during the 1 980s. Large, arid areas of the w estern United States are 
experiencing at least some desertifi  cation as the result of human activities and severe droughts. 386 Environmental Chemistry
As the populations of the western United States increase, one of the greatest challenges facing the 
residents is to prevent additional conversion of land into desert.
The most important part of the geosphere for life on Earth is soil. It is the medium upon which 
plants grow, and virtually all terrestrial organisms depend upon it for their existence. The produc-
tivity of soil is strongly affected by environmental conditions and pollutants. Because of the impor-
tance of soil, all of Chapter 16 is devoted to its environmental chemistry.
With increasing population and industrialization, one of the more important aspects of human 
use of the geosphere has to do with the protection of water sources. Mining, agricultural, chemical, 
and radioactive wastes all have the potential for contaminating both surface water and groundwater. 
Sewage sludge spread on land may contaminate water by release of nitrate and heavy metals. 
Landfi  lls may likewise be sources of contamination. Leachates from unlined pits and lagoons con-
taining hazardous liquids or sludges may pollute drinking water.
It should be noted, however, that many soils have the ability to assimilate and neutralize pollut-
ants. Various chemical and biochemical phenomena in soils operate to reduce the harmful nature of 
pollutants. These phenomena include oxidation–reduction processes, hydrolysis, acid–base reac-
tions, precipitation, sorption, and biochemical degradation. Some hazardous organic chemicals may 
be degraded to harmless products on soil, and heavy metals may be sorbed by it. In general, how-
ever, extreme care should be exercised in disposing of chemicals, sludges, and other potentially 
hazardous materials on soil, particularly where there is a possibility of water contamination.
15.2 THE NATURE OF SOLIDS IN THE GEOSPHERE
Earth is divided into layers, including the solid iron-rich inner core, molten outer core, mantle, and 
crust. Environmental chemistry is most concerned with the lithosphere , which consists of the outer 
mantle and the crust . The crust is the Earth’s outer skin that is accessible to humans. It is extremely 
thin compared to the Earth’s diameter, ranging from 5 to 40 km thick.
Most of the solid earth crust consists of rocks. Rocks are composed of minerals, where a mineral  
is a naturally occurring inorganic solid with a defi  nite internal crystal structure and chemical com-
position. A rock is a solid, cohesive mass of pure mineral or an aggregate of two or more minerals. 
15.2.1 S TRUCTURE  AND PROPERTIES  OF MINERALS
The combination of two characteristics is unique to a particular mineral. These characteristics are a 
defi ned chemical composition, as expressed by the mineral’s chemical formula, and a specifi  c crys-
tal structure. The crystal structure  of a mineral refers to the way in which the atoms are arranged 
relative to each other. It cannot be determined from the appearance of visible crystals of the  mineral, 
but requires structural methods such as x-ray structure determination. Different minerals may have 
the same chemical composition, or they may have the same crystal structure, but may not be identi-
cal for truly different minerals.
Physical properties of minerals can be used to classify them. The characteristic external appear-
ance of a pure crystalline mineral is its crystal form . Because of space constraints on the ways that 
minerals grow, the pure crystal form of a mineral is often not expressed. Color  is an obvious charac-
teristic that can vary widely due to the presence of impurities. The appearance of a mineral surface 
in refl  ected light describes its luster , which may be metallic, partially metallic (submetallic), vitreous 
(like glass), dull or earthy, resinous, or pearly. The color observed when a mineral is rubbed across 
an unglazed porcelain plate is known as streak . Hardness  is expressed on the Mohs scale, which 
ranges from 1 to 10 and is based upon 10 minerals that vary from talc, hardness 1, to diamond, hard-
ness 10. Cleavage  denotes the manner in which minerals break along planes and the angles in which 
these planes intersect. For example, mica cleaves to form thin sheets. Most minerals fracture  irregu-
l a r l y ,  a l t h o u g h  s o m e  f r a c t u r e  a l o n g  s m o o t h  c u r v e d  s u r f a c e s  o r  i n t o  fi  bers or splinters. Specifi  c 
 gravity —density relative to that of water—is another important physical characteristic of minerals.The Geosphere and Geochemistry 387
15.2.2  KINDS OF MINERALS
Although over 2000 minerals are known, only about 25 rock-forming minerals  make up most of the 
Earth’s crust.1 The nature of these minerals may be better understood with a knowledge of the ele-
mental composition of the crust. Oxygen and silicon make up 49.5% and 25.7% by mass of the Earth’s 
crust, respectively. Therefore, most minerals are silicates  s u c h  a s  q u a r t z ,  S i O2, or orthoclase, 
KAlSi3O8. In descending order of abundance; the other elements in the Earth’s crust are aluminum 
(7.4%), iron (4.7%), calcium (3.6%), sodium (2.8%), potassium (2.6%), magnesium (2.1%), and other 
(1.6%). Table 15.1 summarizes the major kinds of minerals in the Earth’s crust.
Secondary minerals  are formed by alteration of parent mineral matter. Clays  are silicate miner-
als, usually containing aluminum, that constitute one of the most signifi  cant classes of secondary 
minerals. Olivine, augite, hornblende, and feldspars all form clays. Clays are discussed in detail in 
Section 15.7.
15.2.3  EVAPORITES
Evaporites  are soluble salts that precipitate from a solution under special arid conditions, commonly 
as the result of the evaporation of seawater. The most common evaporite is halite , NaCl. Other 
simple evaporite minerals are sylvite (KCl), thenardite (Na2SO4), and anhydrite (CaSO4). Many 
evaporites are hydrates, including bischofi  te (MgCl2 ⋅ 6H2O), gypsum (CaSO4 ⋅ 2H2O), kieserite 
(MgSO4 ⋅ H2O), and epsomite (MgSO4 ⋅ 7H2O). Double salts, such as carnallite (KMgCl3 ⋅ 6H2O), 
kainite (KMgClSO4 ⋅   11 __ 4  H2O), glaserite (K3Na(SO4)2), polyhalite (K2MgCa2(SO4)4 ⋅ 2H2O), and loe-
weite (Na12Mg7(SO4)13 ⋅ 15H2O), are very common in evaporites.
The precipitation of evaporites from marine and brine sources depends upon a number of factors. 
Prominent among these are the concentrations of the evaporite ions in the water and the solubility 
products of the evaporite salts. The presence of a common ion decreases solubility; for example, 
CaSO4 is precipitated more readily from brine containing Na2SO4 than from a solution containing  
no other source of sulfate. The presence of other salts that do not have a common ion increases 
 solubility because it decreases activity coeffi  cients. Differences in temperature result in signifi  cant 
differences in solubility.

The nitrate deposits that occur in the hot and extraordinarily dry regions of northern Chile are 
chemically unique because of the stability of highly oxidized nitrate salts. The dominant salt, which 
has been mined for its nitrate content for use in explosives and fertilizers, is Chile saltpeter, NaNO3. 
Traces of highly oxidized CaCrO4 and Ca(ClO4)2 are also encountered in these deposits, and some 
regions contain enough Ca(IO3)2 to serve as a commercial source of iodine.
15.2.4 V OLCANIC  SUBLIMATES
A number of mineral substances are gaseous at the magmatic temperatures of volcanoes and are 
mobilized with volcanic gases. These kinds of substances condense near the mouths of volcanic 
fumaroles and are called sublimates . Elemental sulfur is a common sublimate. Some oxides, par-
ticularly of iron and silicon, are deposited as sublimates. Most other sublimates consist of chloride 
and sulfate salts. The cations most commonly involved are monovalent cations of ammonium ion, 
sodium, and potassium; magnesium; calcium; aluminum; and iron. Fluoride and chloride subli-
mates are sources of gaseous HF and HCl formed by their reactions at high temperatures with water, 
such as the following:
 2H2O + SiF4 → 4HF + SiO2 (15.1) 
15.2.5 I GNEOUS , SEDIMENTARY , AND METAMORPHIC  ROCK
At elevated temperatures deep beneath the Earth’s surface, rocks and mineral matter melt to pro-
duce a molten substance called magma . Cooling and solidifi  cation of magma produces igneous 
rock. Common igneous rocks include granite, basalt, quartz (SiO2), pyroxene ((Mg,Fe)SiO3), feld-
spar ((Ca,Na,K)AlSi3O8), olivine ((Mg,Fe)2SiO4), and magnetite (Fe3O4). Igneous rocks are formed 
under water-defi  c i e n t ,  c h e m i c a l l y  r e d u c i n g  c o n d i t i o n s  o f  h i g h  t e m p e r a t u r e  a n d  h i g h  p r e s s u r e .  
Exposed igneous rocks are under wet, oxidizing, low-temperature, and low-pressure conditions. 
Since such conditions are the opposite of those conditions under which igneous rocks were formed, 
the y are n ot in c he mi cal eq uili bri um wi th the ir s urroun din g s w hen the y beco me e x posed. As a 
result, such rocks disintegrate by a process called weathering . Weathering tends to be slow because 
igneous rocks are often hard, nonporous, and of low reactivity. Erosion from wind, water, or glaciers 
picks up materials from weathering rocks and deposits it as sediments  or soil. A process called 
lithifi  cation  describes the conversion of sediments to sedimentary rocks . In contrast to the parent 
igneous rocks, sediments and sedimentary rocks are porous, soft, and chemically reactive. Heat and 
pressure convert sedimentary rock into metamorphic rock .
Sedimentary rocks may be detrital rocks  consisting of solid particles eroded from igneous rocks 
as a consequence of weathering; quartz is the most likely to survive weathering and transport from 
its original location chemically intact. A second kind of sedimentary rocks consists of chemical 
sedimentary  rocks  produced by the precipitation or coagulation of dissolved or colloidal weathering 
products. Organic sedimentary rocks  contain residues of plant and animal remains. Carbonate min-
erals of calcium and magnesium— limestone or dolomite —are especially abundant in sedimentary 
rocks. Important examples of sedimentary rocks are the following:
Sandstone produced from sand-sized particles of minerals such as quartz• 
Conglomerates made up of relatively larger particles of variable size• 
Shale formed from very fi  ne particles of silt or clay • 
Limestone, CaCO• 3, produced by the chemical or biochemical precipitation of calcium 
carbonate:

15.2.5.1 Rock Cycle
The interchanges and conversions among igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks, as well 
as the processes involved therein, are described by the rock cycle . A rock of any of these three types 
may be changed to a rock of any other type. Or a rock of any of these three kinds may be changed 
to a different rock of the same general type in the rock cycle. The rock cycle is illustrated in 
Figure 15.1.
15.2.5.2 Stages of Weathering
Weathering can be classifi  ed into early , intermediate , and advanced stages . The stage of weather-
ing to which a mineral is exposed depends upon time; chemical conditions, including exposure to 
air, carbon dioxide, and water; and physical conditions such as temperature and mixing with water 
and air.
Reactive and soluble minerals such as carbonates, gypsum, olivine, feldspars, and iron(II)-rich 
substances can survive only early weathering. This stage is characterized by dry conditions, low 
leaching, absence of organic matter, reducing conditions, and limited time of exposure. Quartz, 
vermiculite, and smectites can survive the intermediate stage of weathering manifested by retention 
of silica, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and iron(II) not present in iron(II) oxides. These 
substances are mobilized in advanced-stage weathering, other characteristics of which are intense 
leaching by freshwater, low pH, oxidizing conditions [iron(II) → iron(III)], presence of hydroxy 
polymers of aluminum, and dispersion of silica.
15.3 PHYSICAL FORM OF THE GEOSPHERE
The most fundamental aspect of the physical form of the geosphere has to do with the Earth’s shape 
and dimensions. Earth is shaped as a geoid  defi ned by a surface corresponding to the average sea 
level of the oceans and continuing as hypothetical sea levels under the continents. This shape is not 
a perfect sphere because of variations in the attraction of gravity at various places on the Earth’s 
surface. This slight irregularity in shape is important in surveying to precisely determine the loca-
tions of points on the Earth’s surface according to longitude, latitude, and elevation above sea level. 
Of more direct concern to humans is the nature of landforms and the processes that occur on them. 
This area of study is classifi  ed as geomorphology .Earth’s surfaceSedimentary rock melts,

15.3.1 P LATE TECTONICS  AND CONTINENTAL  DRIFT
The geosphere has a highly varied, constantly changing physical form. Most of the Earth’s land 
mass is contained in several massive continents separated by vast oceans. Towering mountain ranges 
span across the continents, and in some places the ocean bottom is at extreme depths. Earthquakes, 
which often cause great destruction and loss of life, and volcanic eruptions, which sometimes throw 
enough material into the atmosphere to cause temporary changes in climate, serve as reminders that 
Earth is a dynamic, living body that continues to change. There is convincing evidence, such as the 
close fi  t between the western coast of Africa and the eastern coast of South America, that suggest 
th a t  w i d e l y  s e p ar a t e d  c o n t i n e n t s  w e r e  o n c e  j o i n e d  an d  h a v e  m o v e d  r e l a t i v e  t o  e a c h  o th e r .  Thi s  
 ongoing phenomenon is known as continental drift . It is now believed that 200 million years ago 
much of the Earth’s land mass was all part of a supercontinent, now called Gowandaland. This 
continent split apart to form the present-day continents of Antarctica, Australia, Africa, and South 
America, as well as Madagascar, the Seychelle Islands, and India.
The observations described above are explained by the theory of plate tectonics .2 This theory 
views the Earth’s solid surface as consisting of several rigid plates that move relative to each other. 
These plates drift at an average rate of several centimeters per year atop a relatively weak, partially 
molten layer that is part of the Earth’s upper mantle called the asthenosphere . The science of plate 
tectonics explains the large-scale phenomena that affect the geosphere, including the creation and 
enlargement of oceans as the ocean fl  oors open up and spread, the collision and breaking apart of 
continents, the formation of mountain chains, volcanic activities, the creation of islands of volcanic 
origin, and earthquakes.
The boundaries between these plates are where most geological activity such as earthquakes and 
volcanic activity occur. These boundaries are of the three following types:
Divergent boundaries• , where the plates are moving away from each other. Occurring on 
ocean fl  oors, these are regions in which hot magma fl  ows upward and cools to produce new 
solid lithosphere. This new solid material creates ocean ridges .
Convergent boundaries• , where plates move toward each other. One plate may be pushed 
beneath the other in a subduction zone  in which matter is buried in the asthenosphere and 
e v e n tuall y  r e m e l ted  t o  f o rm  n e w  ma gma.  Wh e n  thi s  d oe s  n o t  occ ur ,  th e  li th o s p h e r e  i s  
pushed up to form mountain ranges along a collision boundary.
Transform fault boundaries•  in which two plates slide past each other. These boundaries 
create faults that result in earthquakes.
The phenomena described above are parts of the tectonic cycle , a geological cycle that describes 
how tectonic plates move relative to each other, magma rises to form new solid rocks, and solid 
lithospheric rocks sink to become melted thus forming new magma. The tectonic cycle is illustrated 
in Figure 15.2.
15.3.2 S TRUCTURAL  GEOLOGY
The Earth’s surface is constantly being reshaped by geological processes. The movement of rock 
masses during processes such as the formation of mountains results in substantial deformation of 
rock. At the opposite extreme of the size scale are defects in crystals at a microscopic level. Structural 
geology  addresses the geometric forms of geological structures over a wide range of sizes, the 
nature of structures formed by geological processes, and the formation of folds, faults, and other 
geological structures.
Primary structures  are those that have resulted from the formation of a rock mass from its 
parent materials. Primary structures are modifi  ed and deformed to produce secondary structures . 
A basic premise of structural geology is that most layered rock formations were deposited in a 
horizontal confi  guration. Cracking of such a formation without displacement of the separate parts The Geosphere and Geochemistry 391
of the formation relative to each other produces a joint , whereas displacement produces a fault  
(Figure 15.3).
A key relationship in structural geology is that between the force or stress  placed upon a geologi-
cal formation or object and the deformation resulting from it, called the strain . An important aspect 
of structural geology, therefore, is rheology , which deals with the deformation and fl  ow of solids and 
semisolids. Whereas rocks tend to be strong, rigid, and brittle under the conditions at the Earth’s 
surface, their rheology changes such that they may become weak and pliable under the extreme 
conditions of temperature and pressure at signifi  cant depths below the Earth’s surface.
15.4 INTERNAL PROCESSES
The preceding section addressed the physical form of the geosphere. Related to the physical 
 confi guration of the geosphere are several major kinds of processes that occur that change this con-
fi guration and that have the potential to cause damage and even catastrophic effects.3 These can be 
divided into the two main categories: internal processes  that arise from phenomena located signifi  -
cantly below the Earth’s surface and surface processes  that occur on the surface. Internal processes 
are addressed in this section, and surface processes in Section 15.5.Ocean

15.4.1 E ARTHQUAKES
Earthquakes  usually arise from plate tectonic processes and originate along plate boundaries occur-
ring as motion of ground resulting from the release of energy that accompanies an abrupt slippage of 
rock formations subjected to stress along a fault. Basically, two huge masses of rock tend to move rela-
tive to each other, but are locked together along a fault line. This causes deformation of the rock forma-
tions, which increases with increasing stress. Eventually, the friction between the two moving bodies 
is insuffi  cient to keep them locked in place, and movement occurs along an existing fault, or a new 
fault is formed. Freed from constraints on their movement, the rocks undergo elastic rebound, causing 
Earth to shake. The serious earthquake damage that may ensue is discussed further in Section 15.10.
In addition to shaking of ground, which can be quite violent, earthquakes can cause the ground 
to rupture, subside, or rise. Liquefaction  is an importan t phenomenon that occurs durin g earth-
quakes with ground that is poorly consolidated and in which the water table may be high. Liquefaction 
results from separation of soil particles accompanied by water infi  ltration. When this occurs, the 
ground behaves like a fl  uid.
The location of the initial movement along a fault that causes an earthquake to occur is called the 
focus  of the earthquake. The surface location directly above the focus is the epicenter . Energy is 
transmitted from the focus by seismic waves . Seismic waves that travel through the interior of Earth 
are called body waves  and those that traverse the surface are surface waves . Body waves are further 
categorized into P-waves , compressional vibrations that result from the alternate compression and 
expansion of geospheric material, and S-waves , consisting of shear waves manifested by sideways 
oscillations of material. The motions of these waves are detected by a seismograph , often at great 
distances from the epicenter. The two types of waves move at different rates, with P-waves moving 
faster. From the arrival times of the two kinds of waves at different seismographic locations, it is 
possible to locate the epicenter of an earthquake.
15.4.2 V OLCANOES
In addition to earthquakes, the other major subsurface process that has the potential to massively 
affect the environment consists of emissions of molten rock (lava), gases, steam, ash, and parti-
cles due to the presence of magma near the Earth’s surface. This phenomenon is called a volcano  
(Figure 15.4). Volcanoes can be very destructive and damaging to the environment. Aspects of the 
potential harm from volcanoes are discussed in Section 15.11.
FIGURE 15.4 Volcanoes come in many shapes and forms. A classically shaped volcano may be a cinder cone 
formed by ejection of rock and lava, called pyroclastics, from the volcano to produce a relatively uniform cone.The Geosphere and Geochemistry 393
Volcanoes take on a variety of forms, which are beyond the scope of this chapter to cover in 
detail. Basically, they are formed when magma rises to the surface. This frequently occurs in sub-
duction zones created where one plate is pushed beneath another (see Figure 15.2). The downward 
movement of solid lithospheric material subjects it to high temperatures and pressures that cause the 
rock in it to melt and raise to the surface as magma. Molten magma issuing from a volcano at tem-
peratures usually in excess of 500 °C and often as high as 1400 °C, is called lava, and is one of the 
most common manifestations of volcanic activity.
15.4.3  SURFACE  PROCESSES
Surface geological features are formed by upward movement of materials from the Earth’s crust. 
With exposure to water, oxygen, freeze–thaw cycles, organisms, and other infl  uences on the surface, 
surface features are subject to two processes that largely determine the landscape: weathering and 
erosion. As noted earlier in this chapter, weathering consists of the physical and chemical break -
down of rock and erosion is the removal and movement of weathered products by the action of wind, 
liquid water, and ice. Weathering and erosion work together in that one augments the other in break-
ing down rock and moving the products. Weathered products removed by erosion are eventually 
deposited as sediments and may undergo diagenesis and lithifi  cation to form sedimentary rocks.
One of the most common surface processes that can adversely affect humans consists of  landslides  
that occur when soil or other unconsolidated materials slide down a slope. Related phenomena 
include rockfalls, mudfl  ows, and snow avalanches. Destructive surface processes are discussed fur-
ther in Section 15.12.
15.5 SEDIMENTS
Vast areas of land, as well as lake and stream sediments, are formed from sedimentary rocks. The 
properties of these masses of material depend strongly upon their origins and transport. Water is the 
main vehicle of sediment transport, although wind can also be signifi  cant. Hundreds of millions of 
tons of sediment are carried by major rivers each year.
The action of fl  owing water in streams cuts away stream banks and carries sedimentary materi-
als for great distances. Sedimentary materials such as the following may be carried by fl  owing water 
in streams:
Dissolved load•  from sediment-forming minerals in solution
Suspended load•  from solid sedimentary materials carried along in suspension
Bed load•  dragged along the bottom of the stream channel
The transport of calcium carbonate as dissolved calcium bicarbonate provides a straightforward 
example of dissolved load and is the most prevalent type of such a load. Water with a high dis-
solved carbon dioxide content (usually present as the result of bacterial action) in contact with 
calcium  carbonate formations contains Ca2+ and HCO3− ions. Flowing water containing calcium as 
the HCO3− salt has temporary hardness  but may become more basic by loss of CO2 to the atmo-
sphere, consumption of CO2 by algal growth, or contact with dissolved base, resulting in the depo-
sition of insoluble CaCO3:
 Ca2+ + 2HCO3- Æ CaCO3(s) + CO2( g) + H2O (15.2)
Most fl  owing water that contains dissolved load originates underground, where the water has had 
the opportunity to dissolve minerals from the rock strata that it has passed through.
Most sediments are transported by streams as suspended load, obvious in the observation of 
“mud” in the fl  owing water of rivers draining agricultural areas or fi  nely divided rock in Alpine 394 Environmental Chemistry
streams fed by melting glaciers. Under normal conditions, fi  nely divided silt, clay, or sand makes up 
most of the suspended load, although larger particles are transported in rapidly fl  owing water. 
The degree and rate of movement of suspended sedimentary material in streams are functions of the 
velocity of water fl  ow and the settling velocity of the particles in suspension.
Bed load is moved along the bottom of a stream by the action of water “pushing” particles along. 
Particles carried as bed load do not move continuously. The grinding action of such particles is an 
important factor in stream erosion.
Typically, about two-third of the sediment carried by a stream is transported in suspension, about 
one-fourth in solution, and the remaining relatively small fraction as bed load. The ability of a 
stream to carry sediment increases with both the overall rate of fl  ow of the water (mass per unit 
time) and the velocity of the water. Both of these are higher under fl  ood conditions, so fl  oods are 
particularly important in the transport of sediments.
Streams mobilize sedimentary materials through erosion , transport  the materials along with 
stream fl  ow, and release them in a solid form during deposition . Deposits of stream-borne sedi-
ments are called alluvium . As conditions such as lowered stream velocity begin to favor deposition, 
larger, more settleable particles are released fi  rst. This results in sorting  such that particles of a simi-
lar size and type tend to occur together in alluvial deposits. Much sediment is deposited in fl  ood 
plains where streams overfl  ow their banks.
15.6 CLAYS
Clays are extremely common and important in mineralogy. Furthermore, in general, clays predomi-
nate in the inorganic components of most soils (see Chapter 16) and are very important in holding 
water and in plant nutrient cation exchange. All clays contain silicate and most contain aluminum 
and water. Physically, clays consist of very fi  ne grains having sheet-like structures. For the purposes 
of the discussion here, clay is defi  ned as a group of microcrystalline secondary minerals consisting 
of hydrous aluminum silicates that have sheet-like structures. Clay minerals are distinguished from 
each other by general chemical formula, structure, and chemical and physical properties. The three 
major groups of clay minerals are the following:
Montmorillonite• , Al2(OH)2Si4O10
Illite• , K0–2Al4(Si8–6Al0–2)O20(OH)4
Kaolinite• , Al2Si2O5(OH)4
Many clays contain large amounts of sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and iron, as well as 
trace quantities of other metals. Clays bind cations such as Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, and NH4+, which 
protects the cations from leaching by water but keeps them available in soil as plant nutrients. 
Since many clays are readily suspended in water as colloidal particles, they may be leached from 
soil or carried to lower soil layers.
Olivine, augite, hornblende, and feldspars are all parent minerals that form clays. An example is 
the formation of kaolinite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4) from potassium feldspar rock (KAlSi3O8):
 2KAlSi3O8(s) + 2H+ + 9H2O Æ Al2Si2O5(OH)4(s) + 2K+(aq) + 4H4SiO4(aq) (15.3)
The layered structures of clays consist of sheets of silicon oxide alternating with sheets of alumi-
num oxide. The silicon oxide sheets are made up of tetrahedra in which each silicon atom is sur-
rounded by four oxygen atoms. Of the four oxygen atoms in each tetrahedron, three are shared with 
other silicon atoms that are components of other tetrahedra. This sheet is called the tetrahedral sheet . 
The aluminum oxide is contained in an octahedral sheet , so named because each aluminum atom is 
surrounded by six oxygen atoms in an octahedral confi  guration. The structure is such that some of the 
oxygen atoms are shared between aluminum atoms and some are shared with the tetrahedral sheet.The Geosphere and Geochemistry 395
Structurally, clays may be classifi  ed as either two-layer clays  in which oxygen atoms are shared 
between a tetrahedral sheet and an adjacent octahedral sheet, or three-layer clays  in which an octahe-
dral sheet shares oxygen atoms with tetrahedral sheets on either side. These layers composed of either 
two or three sheets are called unit layers . A unit layer of a two-layer clay typically is around 0.7 nm 
thick, whereas that of a three-layer clay exceeds 0.9 nm in thickness. The structure of the two-layer 
clay kaolinite is represented in Figure 15.5. Some clays, particularly the montmorillonites, may absorb 
large quantities of water between unit layers, a process accompanied by swelling of the clay.
As described in Section 5.4, clay minerals may attain a net negative charge by ion replacement , 
in which Si(IV) and Al(III) ions are replaced by metal ions of similar size but lesser charge. 
Compensation must be made for this negative charge by association of cations with the clay layer 
surfaces. Since these cations need not fi  t specifi  c sites in the crystalline lattice of the clay, they may 
be relatively large ions, such as K+, Na+, or NH4+. These cations are called exchangeable cations  
and are exchangeable for other cations in water. The amount of exchangeable cations, expressed as 
milliequivalents (of monovalent cations) per 100 g of dry clay, is called the CEC of the clay and is 
a very important characteristic of colloids and sediments that have cation-exchange capabilities.
15.7 GEOCHEMISTRY
Geochemistry  deals with chemical species, reactions, and processes in the lithosphere and their 
interactions with the atmosphere and hydrosphere. The branch of geochemistry that explores the 
complex interactions among the rock/water/air/life systems that determine the chemical character-
istics of the surface environment is environmental geochemistry . Obviously, geochemistry and its FIGURE 15.5 Representation of the structure of kaolinite, a two-layer clay.Water molecules

15.7.1 P HYSICAL  ASPECTS  OF WEATHERING
Defi ned in Section 15.2, weathering  is discussed here as a geochemical phenomenon. Rocks tend to 
weather more rapidly when there are pronounced differences in physical conditions—alternate 
freezing and thawing and wet periods alternating with severe drying. Other mechanical aspects are

through cracks in rocks. Temperature is involved in that the rates of chemical weathering (below) 
increase with increasing temperature. 
15.7.2 C HEMICAL  WEATHERING
As a chemical phenomenon, weathering can be viewed as the result of the tendency of the rock/  water/
mineral system to attain equilibrium. This occurs through the usual chemical mechanisms of 
 dissolution/precipitation, acid–base reactions, complexation, hydrolysis, and oxidation–reduction.
Weathering occurs extremely slowly in dry air but is many orders of magnitude faster in the 
 presence of water. Water itself is a chemically active weathering substance and it holds weathering 
agents in solution such that they are transported to chemically active sites on rock minerals and 
contact the mineral surfaces at the molecular and ionic levels. Prominent among such weathering 
agents are CO2, O2, organic acids (including humic and fulvic acids, see Section 3.17), sulfur acids 
(SO2(aq) and H2SO4), and nitrogen acids (HNO3 and HNO2). Water provides the source of H+ ion 
needed for acid-forming gases to act as acids as shown by the following:
 CO2 + H2O Æ H+ + HCO3-  (15.4)
 SO2 + H2O Æ H+ + HSO3-  (15.5)
Rainwater is essentially free of mineral solutes. It is usually slightly acidic due to the presence of 
dissolved carbon dioxide or more highly acidic because of acid-rain-forming constituents. As a 
result of its slight acidity and lack of alkalinity and dissolved calcium salts, rainwater is chemically 
aggressive  (see Section 8.7) toward some kinds of mineral matter, which it breaks down by chemical 
weathering processes. Because of this process, river water has a higher concentration of dissolved 
inorganic solids than does rainwater.
The processes involved in chemical weathering may be divided into the following major 
categories:
Hydration/dehydration• , for example:
 CaSO4(s) + 2H2O Æ CaSO4 ⋅ 2H2O(s)
 2Fe(OH)3 ⋅ xH2O(s) Æ Fe2O3(s) + (3 + 2x)H2O
Dissolution• , for example:
 CaSO4 ⋅ 2H2O(s) (water) Æ Ca2+(aq) + SO42−(aq) + 2H2O
Oxidation• , such as occurs in the dissolution of pyrite:
 4FeS2(s) + 15O2( g) + (8 + 2x)H2O Æ 2Fe2O3 ⋅ xH2O + 8SO42-(aq) + 16H+(aq)The Geosphere and Geochemistry 397
 or in the following example in which dissolution of an iron(II) mineral is followed by 
 oxidation of iron(II) to iron(III):
 Fe2SiO4(s) + 4CO2(aq) + 4H2O → 2Fe2+ + 4HCO3- + H4SiO4
 4Fe2+ + 8HCO3- + O2( g) → 2Fe2O3(s) + 8CO2 + 4H2O 
 The second of these two reactions may occur at some distance from the fi  rst, resulting in 
net transport of iron from its original location. Iron, manganese, and sulfur are the major 
elements that undergo oxidation as part of the weathering process.
Dissolution with hydrolysis•  as occurs with the hydrolysis of carbonate ion when mineral 
carbonates dissolve:
 CaCO3(s) + H2O → Ca2+(aq) + HCO3-(aq) + OH-(aq)
 Hydrolysis is the major means by which silicates undergo weathering as shown by the fol-
lowing reaction of forsterite:
 Mg2SiO4(s) + 4CO2 + 4H2O → 2Mg2+ + 4HCO3- + H4SiO4
 The weathering of silicates yields soluble silicon as species such as H4SiO4, and residual 
silicon-containing minerals (clay minerals).
Acid hydrolysis• , which accounts for the dissolution of signifi  cant amounts of CaCO3 and 
CaCO3 ⋅ MgCO3 in the presence CO2-rich water:
 CaCO3(s) + H2O + CO2(aq) Æ Ca2+(aq) + 2HCO3-(aq)
Complexation• , as exemplifi  ed b y the reac ti o n o f o x al ate i o n, C2O42−, with aluminum in 
muscovite, K2(Si6Al2)Al4O20(OH)4:
 K2(Si6Al2)Al4O20(OH)4(s) + 6C2O42-(aq) + 20H+ Æ 6AlC2O4+(aq) + 6Si(OH)4 + 2K+
Reactions such as these largely determine the kinds and concentrations of solutes in surface 
water and groundwater. Acid hydrolysis, especially, is the predominant process that releases  elements 
such as Na+, K+, and Ca2+ from silicate minerals.
15.7.3 B IOLOGICAL  ASPECTS  OF WEATHERING
Organisms may play a strong role in weathering processes and formation of soil. Cavities on top of 
rock formations and boulders in some areas accumulate water, mineral debris, and organic debris. 
These cavities may serve as sites of miniature ecosystems, supporting initially cyanobacteria, green 
algae, fungi, bacteria, and insects. Organic acids released by the organisms and humic matter 
 produced by degradation of vegetable matter in the cavities tend to dissolve the rock and enlarge the 
cavities. Small rock crystals are released that eventually weather to produce secondary minerals 
such as clays. Eventually, vascular plants begin to grow in the miniature ecosystems and embryonic 
soils develop.
15.8 GROUNDWATER IN THE GEOSPHERE
Groundwater (Figure 15.6) is a vital resource in its own right that plays a crucial role in geochemical 
processes, such as the formation of secondary minerals. The nature, quality, and mobility of 
 groundwater are all strongly dependent upon the rock formations in which the water is held. 398 Environmental Chemistry
Physically , an important characteristic of such formations is their porosity , which determines the 
percentage of rock volume available to contain water. Another important physical characteristic is 
permeability , which describes the ease of fl  ow of the water through the rock. High permeability is 
usually associated with high porosity . However, clays tend to have low permeability even when a 
large percentage of the volume is fi  lled with water.
Most groundwater originates as meteoric  water from precipitation in the form of rain or snow. 
If water from this source is not lost by evaporation, transpiration, or to stream runoff, it may infi  l-
trate into the ground. Initial amounts of water from precipitation onto dry soil are held very tightly 
as a fi  lm on the surfaces and in the micropores of soil particles in a belt of soil moisture . At inter-
mediate levels, the soil particles are covered with fi  lms of water, but air is still present in larger voids 
in the soil. The region in which such water is held is called the unsaturated zone  or zone of aeration  
and the water present in it is vadose water . At lower depths in the presence of adequate amounts of 
water, all voids are fi  lled to produce a zone of saturation , the upper level of which is the water table . 
Water present in a zone of saturation is called groundwater . Because of its surface tension, water is 
drawn somewhat above the water table by capillary-sized passages in soil in a region called the 
capillary fringe.
The water table (Figure 15.7) is crucial for explaining and predicting the fl  ow of wells and 
springs and the levels of streams and lakes. It is also an important factor in determining the extent 
to which pollutant and hazardous chemicals underground are likely to be transported by water. 
The water table can be mapped by observing the equilibrium level of water in wells, which is 
essentially the same as the top of the saturated zone. The water table is usually not level, but tends 
to follow the general contours of the surface topography. It also varies with differences in 
 permeability and water infi  ltration. The water table is at surface level in the vicinity of swamps and 
frequently above the surface where lakes and streams are encountered. The water level in such 
bodies may be maintained by the water table. Infl  uent  streams or reservoirs are located above the 
water table; they lose water to the underlying aquifer and cause an upward bulge in the water table 
beneath the surface water.FIGURE 15.6 Some major features of the distribution of water underground.

Groundwater fl o w is an important consideration in determining the accessibility of the water for 
use and transport of pollutants from underground waste sites. Various parts of a body of  groundwater 
are in hydraulic contact so that a change in pressure at one point will tend to affect the pressure and 
level at another point. For example, infi  ltration from a heavy, localized rainfall may affect the water 
table at a point remote from the infi  ltration. Groundwater fl  ow occurs as the result of the natural 
tendency of the water table to assume even levels by the action of gravity.
Groundwater fl  ow is strongly infl  uenced by rock permeability. Porous or extensively fractured 
rock is relatively highly pervious , meaning that water can migrate through the holes, fi  ssures, and 
pores in such rock. Because water can be extracted from it, such a formation is called an aquifer . 
By contrast, an aquiclude  is a rock formation that is too impermeable or unfractured to yield ground-
water. Impervious rock in the unsaturated zone may retain water infi  ltrating from the surface to 
produce a perched water table  that is above the main water table and from which water may be 
extracted. However, the amounts of water that can be extracted from such a formation are limited 
and the water is vulnerable to contamination.
15.8.1 W ATER WELLS
Most groundwater is tapped for use by water wells drilled into the saturated zone. The use and 
 misuse of water from this source have a number of environmental implications. In the United States, 
about two-third of the groundwater pumped is consumed for irrigation; lesser amounts of ground-
water are used for industrial and municipal applications.
As water is withdrawn, the water table in the vicinity of the well is lowered. This drawdown  of 
water creates a zone of depression . In extreme cases the groundwater is severely depleted and 
 surface land levels can even subside (which is one reason why Venice, Italy is now very vulnerable 
to fl ooding). Heavy drawdown can result in infi  ltration of pollutants from sources such as septic 
tanks, municipal refuse sites, and hazardous waste dumps. When soluble iron(II) or manganese(II) 
is present in groundwater, exposure to air at the well wall can result in the formation of deposits of 
insoluble Fe(III) and Mn(IV) oxides produced by bacterially catalyzed processes:
 4Fe2+(aq) + O2(aq) + 10H2O Æ 4Fe(OH)3(s) + 8H+ (15.6)
 2Mn2+(aq) + O2(aq) + (2x + 2)H2O Æ 2MnO2⋅xH2O(s) + 4H+ (15.7)
Deposits of iron(III) and manganese(IV) that result from the processes outlined above line the sur-
faces from which water fl  ows into the well with a coating that is relatively impermeable to water. 
The deposits fi  ll the spaces that water must traverse to enter the well. As a result, they can seriously 
impede the fl  ow of water into the well from the water-bearing aquifer. This creates major water 
source problems for municipalities using groundwater for water supply. As a result of this problem, 
chemical or mechanical cleaning, drilling of new wells, or even acquisition of new water sources 
may be required.FIGURE 15.7 The water table and infl  uences of surface features on it.

15.8.2  QANATS
An interesting ancient technology for utilizing groundwater is the qanat  (Figure 15.8). Basically the 
qanat consists of a tunnel drilled into an aquifer and leading to an outfl  ow located below the eleva-
tion of the aquifer. Typical lengths of the conduits in qanats are 10–16 km, although they have 
reached almost 30 km in length. Iran is the world’s center of qanat technology dating back to ancient 
Persia some 3000 years ago. There are about 22,000 qanat units containing over 270,000 km of 
conduits in Iran that supply about 75% of the nation’s water for irrigation and domestic use. Now the 
system in Iran is threatened by tube wells drilled into the aquifers that are lowering water tables and 
draining water from the qanats.
15.9 ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS OF THE GEOSPHERE
Most of the remainder of this chapter deals specifi  cally with the environmental aspects of geology 
and human interactions with the geosphere. It discusses how natural geological phenomena affect 
the environment through occurrences such as volcanic eruptions that may blast so much particulate 
matter and acid gas into the atmosphere that it may have a temporary effect on global climate, or 
massive earthquakes that disrupt surface topography and disturb the fl  ow and distribution of ground-
water and surface water. Also discussed are human infl  uences on the geosphere and the strong con-
nection between the geosphere and the anthrosphere.4
Going back several billion years to its formation as a ball of dust particles collected from the 
universe and held together by gravitational forces, Earth has witnessed constant environmental 
change and disruption. During its earlier eons, Earth was a most inhospitable place for humans and, 
indeed, for any form of life. Heat generated by gravitational compression of primitive earth and by 
radioactive elements in its interior caused much of the mass of the planet to liquefy. Relatively high 
density iron sank into the core, and lighter minerals, primarily silicates, solidifi  ed and fl  oated to the 
surface.
Although in the scale of a human lifetime, Earth changes almost imperceptibly; the planet is in 
fact in a state of constant change and turmoil. It is known that continents have formed, broken apart, 
and moved around. Rock formations produced in ancient oceans have been thrust up onto  continental 
land and huge masses of volcanic rock exist where volcanic activity is now unknown. Today the 
angry bowels of Earth unleash enormous forces that push molten rock to the surface and move con-
tinents continuously as evidenced from volcanic activity, and from earthquakes resulting from the 
movement of great land masses relative to each other. The Earth’s surface is constantly changing as 
new mountain ranges are heaved up and old ones are worn down.FIGURE 15.8 Qanats dating back 3000 years are used to transport water from aquifers at relatively high 
elevations to lower elevations where the water is used.AquiferHead well

Humans have learned to work with, against, and around natural earth processes and phenomena 
to exploit the Earth’s resources and to make these processes and phenomena work for the benefi  t of 
humankind. Human efforts have been moderately successful in mitigating some of the major haz-
ards posed by natural geospheric phenomena, although such endeavors often have had unforeseen 
detrimental consequences, sometimes many years after they were fi  rst applied. The survival of 
modern civilization and, indeed, of humankind will depend upon how intelligently humans work 
with Earth. That is why it is so important for humans to have a fundamental understanding of the 
geospheric environment.
An important consideration in human interaction with the geosphere is the application of engi-
neering to geology. Engineering geology takes account of the geological characteristics of soil and 
rock in designing buildings, dams, highways, and other structures in a manner compatible with the 
geological strata on which they rest. Engineering geology must consider a large number of geologi-
cal factors including type, strength, and fracture characteristics of rock, tendency for landslides to 
occur, susceptibility to settling, and likelihood of erosion. Engineering geology is an important 
consideration in land-use planning. 
15.9.1  NATURAL  HAZARDS
Earth presents a variety of natural hazards to the creatures that dwell on it. Some of these are 
the result of internal processes that arise from the movement of land masses relative to each other 
and from heat and intrusions of molten rock from below the surface. The most common such haz-
ards are earthquakes and volcanoes. Whereas internal processes tend to force matter upward, often 
with detrimental effects, surface processes are those that generally result from the tendency of 
 matter to seek lower levels. Such processes include erosion, landslides, avalanches, mudfl  ows, and 
subsidence.
A number of natural hazards result from the interaction and confl  ict between solid earth and 
liquid and solid water. Perhaps the most obvious such hazard consists of fl  oods when too much 
water falls as precipitation and seeks lower levels through stream fl  ow. Wind can team with water 
to increase destructive effects, such as beach erosion and destruction of beachfront property result-
ing from wind-driven seawater. Ice, too, can have some major effects on solid earth. Evidence of 
such effects of the Ice Age times include massive glacial moraines left over from deposition of till 
from melting glaciers, and landscape features carved by advancing ice sheets.
15.9.2  ANTHROPOGENIC  HAZARDS
All too often, attempts to control and reshape the geosphere to human demands have been detri-
mental to the geosphere and dangerous to human life and well-being. Such attempts may exacer-
bate damaging natural phenomena. A prime example of this interaction occurs when efforts are 
made to control the fl  ow of rivers by straightening them and building levees. The initial results can 
be deceptively favorable in that a modifi  ed stream may exist for decades, fl  owing smoothly and 
staying within the confi  nes imposed by humans. But eventually, the forces of nature are likely to 
overwhelm the efforts of humans to control them, such as when a record fl  ood breaks levees and 
destroys structures constructed in fl  ood-prone areas. Landslides of mounds of earthen material

 additional farmland can have some detrimental effects on wildlife and on the overall health of 
ecosystems. 
15.10 EARTHQUAKES
The loss of life and destruction of property by earthquakes makes them some of nature’s more dam-
aging natural phenomena.5 The destructive effects of an earthquake are due to the release of energy. 402 Environmental Chemistry
The released energy moves from the quake’s focus as seismic waves, discussed in Section 15.4. 
Literally millions of lives have been lost in past earthquakes, and damage from an earthquake in a 
developed urban area can easily run into billions of dollars. Earthquakes may cause catastrophic 
secondary effects, especially large, destructive ocean waves called tsunamis (discussed below).
Adding to the terror of earthquakes is their lack of predictability. An earthquake can strike at any 
time—during the calm of late night hours or in the middle of busy rush hour traffi  c. Although the 
exact prediction of earthquakes has so far eluded investigators, the locations where earthquakes are 
most likely to occur are much more well known. These are located in lines corresponding to bound-
aries along which tectonic plates collide and move relative to each other, building up stresses that 
are suddenly released when earthquakes occur. Such interplate boundaries are locations of preexist-
ing faults and breaks. Occasionally, however, an earthquake will occur within a plate, made more 
massive and destructive because for it to occur the thick lithosphere has to be ruptured.
The scale of earthquakes can be estimated by the degree of motion that they cause and by their 
destructiveness. The former is termed the magnitude  of an earthquake and is commonly expressed 
by the Richter scale . The Richter scale is open-ended, and each unit increase in the scale refl  ects a 
10-fold increase in magnitude. Several hundred thousand earthquakes with magnitudes from two to 
three occur each year; they are detected by seismographs, but are not felt by humans. Minor earth-
quakes range from four to fi  ve on the Richter scale, and earthquakes cause damage at a magnitude 
greater than about fi  ve. Great earthquakes, which occur about once or twice a year, register over 
eight on the Richter scale.
The intensity  of an earthquake is a subjective estimate of its potential destructive effect. On the 
Mercalli intensity scale, an intensity III earthquake feels like the passage of heavy vehicles; one with 
an intensity of VII causes diffi  culty in standing, damage to plaster, and dislodging of loose brick, 
whereas a quake with an intensity of XII causes virtually total destruction, throws objects upward, 
and shifts huge masses of earthen material. Intensity does not correlate exactly with magnitude.
Distance from the epicenter, the nature of underlying strata, and the types of structures affected 
may all result in variations in intensity from the same earthquake. In general, structures built on 
bedrock will survive with much less damage than those constructed on poorly consolidated mate-
rial. Displacement of ground along a fault can be substantial, for example, up to 6 m along the 
San Andreas fault during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Such shifts can break pipelines and 
destroy roadways. Highly destructive surface waves can shake vulnerable structures apart.
The shaking and movement of ground are the most obvious means by which earthquakes cause 
damage. In addition to shaking it, earthquakes can cause the ground to rupture, subside, or rise. 
Liquefaction  is an important phenomenon that occurs during earthquakes with ground that is poorly 
consolidated and in which the water table may be high. It results from separation of soil particles 
accompanied by water infi  ltration such that the ground behaves like a fl  uid.
Another devastating phenomenon consists of tsunamis , large ocean waves resulting from earth-
quake-induced movement of ocean fl  oor. T sunamis sweeping onshore at speeds up to 1000 km/h 
have destroyed many homes and taken many lives, often large distances from the epicenter of the 
earthquake itself. This effect occurs when a tsunami approaches land and forms huge breakers, 
some as high as 10–15 m, or even higher. On April 1, 1946, an earthquake off the coast of Alaska 
generated a Tsunami estimated to be more than 30 m high that killed fi  ve people on a nearby light-
house. About 5 h later, a Tsunami generated by the same earthquake reached Hilo, Hawaii, and 
killed 159 people with a wave exceeding 15 m high. The March 27, 1964, Alaska earthquake gener-
ated a tsunami over 10 m high that hit a freighter docked at Valdez, tossing it around like match-
wood. Miraculously, nobody on the freighter was killed, but 28 people on the dock died.
Literally millions of lives have been lost in past earthquakes, and damage from an earthquake in 
a developed urban area can easily run into billions of dollars. As examples, a massive earthquake in 
Egypt and Syria in 1201 ad took over 1 million lives, one in Tangshan, China, in 1976 killed about 
650,000, and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in California cost about $7 billion.The Geosphere and Geochemistry 403

evidence of that, during a 1964 earthquake in Niigata, Japan, some buildings tipped over on their 
sides due to liquefaction of the underlying soil, but remained structurally intact! Other areas of 
endeavor that can lessen the impact of earthquakes are the identifi  cation of areas susceptible to 
earthquakes, discouraging development in such areas, and educating the public about earthquake 
hazards. Accurate prediction would be a tremendous help in lessening the effects of earthquakes, 
but so far has been generally unsuccessful. Most challenging of all is the possibility of preventing 
major earthquakes. One unlikely possibility would be to detonate nuclear explosives deep under-
ground along a fault line to release stress before it builds up to an excessive level. Fluid injection to 
facilitate slippage along a fault has also been considered.
There is some evidence to suggest that human activities can contribute to the occurrence of 
earthquakes in rare cases. On May 12, 2008, the 7.9 magnitude Wenchuan earthquake in Sichuan 
Province, China, that left 80,000 people dead or missing may have been triggered by the mass of 
water contained in the Zipingpu reservoir completed in 2004. Containing about 300 million metric 
tons of water, this reservoir, which was built <2 km from a major fault line, has been estimated to 
have increased pressure on underlying strata as much as 25-fold. The Wenchuan earthquake origi-
nated only about 5 km from the reservoir and spread in a direction that seismologists believe is 
consistent with a quake triggered by the reservoir. As the reservoir was fi  lling, from 2004 to 2005 
the area registered about 730 minor earthquakes of a magnitude of three or less, likely caused in 
part by increasing pressure from the impounded water. In addition to the pressure from the mass of 
the water, water infi  ltration from the reservoir may have lubricated the underlying strata making 
them more prone to movement. Seismologists emphasize that the Wenchuan earthquake would have 
taken place eventually without the added pressure of the impounded water, but the construction may 
have hastened the quake by several hundred years.
15.11 VOLCANOES
Volcanic eruptions can be terrifying and extremely destructive events.6 On May 18, 1980, Mount 
St. Helens, a volcano in Washington State, erupted, blowing out about 1 km3 of material. This mas-
sive blast spread ash over half of the United States, causing about $1 billion in damages and killing 
an  e s tima ted  6 2  peo p l e ,  man y  o f  w h o m  w e r e  n e v e r  f o un d .  M an y  v o l c ani c  di s as te rs  h a v e  bee n  
recorded throughout history. Perhaps the best known of these is the 79 ad eruption of Mount 
Vesuvius, which buried the Roman city of Pompei with volcanic ash.
Temperatures of lava, molten rock fl  owing from a volcano, typically exceed 500 °C and may get 
as high as 1400 °C or more. Lava fl  ows destroy everything in their paths, causing buildings and 
forests to burn and burying them under rock that cools and becomes solid. Often more dangerous 
than a lava fl  ow are the pyroclastics  produced by volcanoes and consisting of fragments of rock and 
lava. Some of these particles are large and potentially very damaging, but they tend to fall quite 
close to the vent. Ash and dust may be carried for large distances and, in extreme cases, as was the 
case in ancient Pompei, may bury large areas to some depth with devastating effects. The explosion 
of Tambora volcano in Indonesia in 1815 blew out about 30 km3 of solid material. The ejection of so 
much solid into the atmosphere had such a devastating effect on global climate that the following 
year was known as “the year without a summer,” causing widespread hardship and hunger because 
of global crop failures.
A special kind of particularly dangerous pyroclastic consists of nuéeardente . This term, French 
for “glowing cloud,” refers to a dense mixture of hot toxic gases and fi  ne ash particles reaching 
temperatures of 1000 °C that can fl  ow down the slopes of a volcano at speeds of up to 100 km/h. 
In 1902, a nuéeardente was produced by the eruption of Mont Pelée on Martinique in the Caribbean. 
Of as many as 40,000 people in the town of St. Pierre, the only survivor was a terrifi  ed prisoner 
shielded from the intense heat by the dungeon in which he was imprisoned.404 Environmental Chemistry
One of the more spectacular and potentially damaging volcanic phenomena is a phreatic erup-
tion that occurs when infi  ltrating water is superheated by hot magma and causes a volcano to liter-
all y  e x p l od e .  Thi s  h a p pe n ed  in  1 8 8 3  w h e n  uninh a b i ted  Kr aka t o a  in  In d o n e s i a  b l e w  u p  w i th  an  
energy release of the order of 100 megatons of TNT. Dust was blown 80 km into the stratosphere, 
and a perceptible climatic cooling was noted for the next 10 years. As is the case with earthquakes, 
volcanic eruptions may cause the devastating tsunamis. Krakatoa produced a tsunami 40 m high 
that killed 30,000–40,000 people on surrounding islands.
Some of the most damaging health and environmental effects of volcanic eruptions are caused 
by gases and particulate matter. Possible effects are discussed in Sections 14.8 and 15.18.
15.11.1 M UD VOLCANOES
Mud volcanoes consist of eruptions of mud, water, and gas from underground reservoirs of mud 
pressurized by overlying rock formations. The largest mud volcano on Earth formed in 2008 in the 
Sidoario district of East Java in Indonesia. It appeared at the site of an oil and gas exploration well 
drilled into the mud formation at a depth of 3000 m and it is suspected that the well caused the 
volcano to form. Large quantities of petroleum-contaminated mud along with some methane and 
toxic hydrogen sulfi  de have been issuing from the volcano since it was formed. Although no humans 
ha v e been in jured, more than 1 2,000 had to be e v acuated and 20 factories, 1 5 mosques, and 1 8 
schools have been inundated. As the mud has been disgorged, an area of surrounding land surface 
has subsided, in places by as much as 100 m. More than 1100 mostly small mud volcanoes from 
natural sources have been observed worldwide. Some large ones in Azerbaijan emit large amounts 
of methane gas and have been burning for centuries. Worldwide, mud volcanoes emit 10–20 million 
metric tons of methane to the atmosphere each year.
15.12 SURFACE EARTH MOVEMENT
Mass movements  are the result of gravity acting upon rock and soil on the Earth’s surface. This 
produces a shearing stress on earthen materials located on slopes that can exceed the shear strength 
of the material and produce landslides and related phenomena involving the downward movement 
of geological materials. Such phenomena are affected by several factors, including the kinds and, 
therefore, strengths of materials, slope steepness, and degree of saturation with water. Usually, a 
specifi  c event initiates mass movement. This can occur when excavation by humans makes the 
slopes steeper, by the action of torrential rains, or by earthquakes.
Illustrated in Figure 15.9, landslides refer to events in which large masses of rock and dirt move 
down the slope rapidly. Such events occur when material resting on a slope at an angle of repose  is 
acted upon by gravity to produce a shearing stress . This stress may exceed the forces of friction or 
shear strength . Weathering, fracturing, water, and other factors may induce the formation of slide 
planes  or failure planes  such that a landslide results.
Loss of life and property from landslides can be substantial. In 1970, a devastating avalanche of 
soil, mud, and rocks initiated by an earthquake slid down Mount Huascaran in Peru killing an esti-
mated 20,000 people. Sometimes the effects are indirect. In 1963, a total of 2600 people were killed 
near the Vaiont Dam in Italy when a sudden landslide fi  lled the reservoir behind the dam with 
earthen material. Although the dam held, the displaced water spilled over its abutments as a wave 
90 m high, wiping out structures and lives in its path.
Although often ignored by developers, the tendency toward landslides is predictable and can be 
used to determine areas in which homes and other structures should not be built. Slope stability maps 
based upon the degree of slope, the nature of underlying geological strata, climatic conditions, and 
other factors can be used to assess the risk of landslides. Evidence of a tendency for land to slide can 
be observed from effects on existing structures, such as walls that have lost their alignment, cracks 
in foundations, and poles that tilt. The likelihood of landslides can be minimized by moving material The Geosphere and Geochemistry 405
from the upper to the lower part of a slope, avoiding the loading of slopes, and avoiding measures that 
might change the degree and pathways of water infi  ltration into slope materials. In cases where the 
risk is not too severe, retaining walls may be constructed that reduce the effects of landslides.
Several measures can be used to warn of landslides. Simple visual observations of changes in the 
surface can be indicative of an impending landslide. More sophisticated measures include tilt meters 
and devices that sense vibrations accompanying the movement of earthen materials.
In addition to landslides, there are several other kinds of mass movements that have the potential 
to be damaging. Rockfalls  occur when rocks fall down slopes so steep that at least part of the time 
the falling material is not in contact with the ground. The fallen material accumulates at the bottom 
of the fall as a pile of talus . A much less spectacular event is creep , in which movement is slow and 
gradual. The action of frost—frost heaving—is a common form of creep. Though usually not life-
threatening, over a period of time creep may ruin foundations and cause misalignment of roads and 
railroads with signifi  cant property damage often being the result.
Sinkholes  are a kind of Earth movement resulting when surface earth falls into an underground 
cavity. They rarely injure people but may cause spectacular property damage. Cavities that produce 
sinkholes may form by the action of water containing dissolved carbon dioxide on limestone 
(see Chapter 3, Reaction 3.7); loss of underground water during drought or from heavy pumping, 
thus removing support that previously kept soil and rock from collapsing; heavy underground water 
fl ow; and other factors that remove solid material from underground strata.
Special problems are presented by permanently frozen ground in arctic climates such as Alaska 
or Siberia. In such areas the ground may remain permanently frozen, thawing to only a shallow 
depth during the summer. This condition is called permafrost . Permafrost poses particular problems 
for construction, especially where the presence of a structure may result in thawing such that the 
structure rests in a pool of water-saturated muck on top of a slick surface of frozen water and soil. 
The construction and maintenance of highways, railroads, and pipelines, such as the Trans-Alaska 
pipeline in Alaska, can become quite diffi  cult in the presence of permafrost.
Some types of soils, particularly the so-called expansive clays, expand and shrink markedly as 
they become saturated with water and dry out. Although essentially never life-threatening, the move-
ment of structures and the damage caused to them by expansive clays can be very high. Aside from 
years when catastrophic fl  oods and earthquakes occur, the monetary damage done by the action of 
expansive soil exceeds that of earthquakes, landslides, fl  oods, and coastal erosion combined!Contour of surface prior to slide

FIGURE 15.9 A landslide occurs when Earth moves along a slip plane. Typically, a landslide consists of an 
upper slump and lower fl  ow. The latter serves to stabilize the slide, and when it is disturbed, such as by cutting 
through it to construct a road, Earth may slide further.406 Environmental Chemistry
15.13 STREAM AND RIVER PHENOMENA
A stream  consists of water fl  owing through a channel. The area of land from which water is drawn 
that fl  ows into a stream is the stream’s drainage basin . The sizes of streams are described by  discharge  
defi ned as the volume of water fl  owing past a given point on the stream per unit time. Discharge and 
gradient , the steepness of the downward slope of a stream, determine the stream velocity .
Internal processes raise masses of land and whole mountain ranges, which in turn are shaped by 
the action of streams. Streams cut down mountain ranges, create valleys, form plains, and produce 
great deposits of sediment, thus playing a key role in shaping the geospheric environment. Streams 
spontaneously develop bends and curves by cutting away the outer parts of stream banks and depos-
iting materials on the inner parts. These curved features of streams are known as meanders . Left 
undisturbed, a stream forms meanders across a valley in a constantly changing pattern. The cutting 
away of material by the stream and the deposition of sediment eventually form a generally fl  at area. 
During times of high stream fl  ow, the stream leaves its banks, inundating parts or all of the valley, 
thus creating a fl o o d p l a i n .
A fl o o d  occurs when a stream develops a high fl  ow such that it leaves its banks and spills out onto 
the fl oodplain. Floods are arguably the most common and damaging of surface phenomena in the 
geosphere. Though natural and in many respects benefi  cial occurrences, fl  oods cause damage to 
structures located in their paths, and the severity of their effects is greatly increased by human 
activities.
A number of factors determine the occurrence and severity of fl  oods. One of these is the  tendency 
of particular geographic areas to receive large amounts of rain within short periods of time. One such 
area is located in the middle of the continental United States where warm, moisture-laden air from 
the Gulf of Mexico is carried northward during the spring months to collide with cold air from the 
north; the resultant cooling of the moist air can cause torrential rains to occur, resulting in severe 
fl ooding. In addition to season and geography, geological conditions have a strong effect on fl  ooding 
potential. Rain falling on a steep surface tends to run off rapidly, creating fl  ooding. A watershed 
can contain relatively massive quantities of rain if it consists of porous, permeable materials 
that allow a substantial rate of infi  ltration, assuming that it is not already saturated. Plants in a 
watershed tend to slow runoff and loosen soil, enabling additional infi  ltration. Through transpira-
tion (see Chapter 16, Section 16.2), plants release moisture to the atmosphere quickly, enabling soil 
to absorb more moisture.
Several terms are used to describe fl  ooding. When the stage  of a stream, that is, the elevation of 
the water surface, exceeds the stream bank level, the stream is said to be at fl  ood stage . The highest 
stage attained defi  nes the fl  ood crest. Upstream  fl oods occur close to the infl  ow from the drainage 
basin, usually the result of intense rainfall. Whereas upstream fl  oods usually affect smaller streams 
and watersheds, downstream fl  oods  occur on larger rivers that drain large areas. Widespread spring 
snowmelt and heavy, prolonged spring rains, often occurring together, cause downstream fl  oods.
Floods are made more intense by higher fractions and higher rates of runoff, both of which may 
be aggravated by human activities. This can be understood by comparing a vegetated drainage basin 
to one that has been largely denuded of vegetation and paved over. In the former case, rainfall is 
retained by vegetation, such as grass cover. Thus the potential fl  ood water is delayed, the time span 
over which it enters a stream is extended, and a higher proportion of the water infi  ltrates into the 
ground. In the latter case, less rainfall infi  ltrates, and the runoff tends to reach the stream quickly 
and to be discharged over a shorter time period, thus leading to more severe fl  ooding. These factors 
are illustrated in Figure 15.10.

 construction of raised banks called levees . In addition to raising the banks to contain a stream, the 
stream channel may be straightened and deepened to increase the volume and velocity of water fl  ow, 
a process called channelization . Although effective for common fl  oods, these measures may 
 exacerbate extreme fl  oods by confi  ning and increasing the fl  o w of w ater upstream such that the The Geosphere and Geochemistry 407
capaci ty to handl e w ater do wns tream is o v erw he lmed. Another so l u ti on is to cons truct dams to 
 create reservoirs for fl  ood control upstream. Usually such reservoirs are multipurpose facilities 
designed for water supply, recreation, and to control river fl  ow for navigation in addition to fl  ood 
control. The many reservoirs constructed for fl  ood control in recent decades have been reasonably 
successful. There are, however, confl  icts in the goals for their uses. Ideally, a reservoir for fl  ood 
control should remain largely empty until needed to contain a large volume of fl  oodwater, an 
approach that is obviously inconsistent with other uses. Another concern is that of exceeding the 
capacity of the reservoir, or dam failure, the latter of which can lead to catastrophic fl  ooding.
15.14 PHENOMENA AT THE LAND/OCEAN INTERFACE
The coastal interface between land masses and the ocean is an important area of environmental 
activity. The land along this boundary is under constant attack from the waves and currents from the 
ocean, so that most coastal areas are always changing. The most common structure of the coast is 
shown in cross section in Figure 15.11. The beach, consisting of sediment, such as sand formed by 
wave action on coastal rock, is a sloping area that is periodically inundated by ocean waves. 
Extending from approximately the high tide mark to the dunes lining the landward edge of the 
beach is a relatively level area called the berm , which is usually not washed over by ocean water. 
The level of water to which the beach is subjected varies with the tides. Through wind action the

surface of the water is in constant motion as undulations called ocean waves . As these waves reach 
the shallow water along the beach, they “touch bottom” and are transformed to breakers , character-
ized by crested tops. These breakers crashing onto a beach give it much of its charm, but can also 
be extremely destructive.
Coastlines exhibit a variety of features. Steep valleys carved by glacial activity, then fi  lled with 
rising seawater, constitute the fjords along the coast of Norway. Valleys, formerly on land, now fi  lled 
with seawater, constitute drowned valleys . Estuaries  occur where tidal saltwater mixes with infl  ow-
ing freshwater.
Erosion is a constant feature of a beachfront. Unconsolidated beach sand can be shifted 
 readily—sometimes spectacularly through great distances over short periods of time—by wave 
action. Sand, pebbles, and rock in the form of rounded cobbles constantly wear against the coast by 
wave action, exerting a continuous abrasive action called milling . This action is augmented by the 
chemical weathering effects of seawater, in which the salt content may play a role.
Some of the more striking alterations to coastlines occur during storms, such as hurricanes and 
typhoons. The low pressure that accompanies severe storms tends to suck ocean water upward. 
This effect, usually combined with strong winds blowing onshore and coinciding with high tide, can 
cause ocean water to wash over the berm on a beach to attack dunes or cliffs inland. Such a storm 
surge  can remove large quantities of beach, damage dune areas, and wash away structures unwisely 
constructed too close to the shore. A storm surge associated with a hurricane washed away most of 
the structures in Galveston, T exas, in 1900, claiming 6000 lives, and, despite the protection of a 
large fl  oodwall constructed after the 1900 hurricane, Galveston was largely destroyed by Hurricane 
Ike in September 2008. A major concern with respect to coastal storms is loss of beaches, which are 
highly prized for their recreational value.
An especially vulnerable part of the coast consists of barrier islands—long, low strips of land 
roughly paralleling the coast some distance offshore. High storm surges may wash completely over 
barrier islands, partially destroying them and shifting them around. Many dwellings unwisely 
 constructed on barrier islands, such as the outer banks of North Carolina, have been destroyed by 
storm surges during hurricanes.
15.14.1 T HE THREAT  OF RISING SEA LEVELS
Large numbers of people live at a level near, or in some cases below, sea level. As a result, any sig-
nifi cant temporary or permanent rise in sea level poses signifi  cant risks to lives and property. 
Such an event occurred on February 1, 1953 when high tides and strong winds combined to breach 
the system of dikes protecting much of the Netherlands from seawater. About one-sixth of the coun-
try was fl  ooded as far inland as 64 km from the coast, killing about 2000 people and leaving 
approximately 100,000 without homes.
Although isolated instances of fl  ooding by seawater caused by combinations of tidal and weather 
phenomena will continue to occur, a much more long-lasting threat is posed by long-term increases 
in sea level. These could result from global warming due to the greenhouse gas emissions discussed 
in Chapter 14. Several factors could raise ocean levels to destructive highs, also a result of green-
house warming. Simple expansion of warmed oceanic water could raise sea levels by about 1/3 m 
over the next century. The melting of glaciers, such as those in the Alps, has probably raised ocean 
levels by about 5 cm during the last century, and the process is continuing. The greatest concern, 
however, is that global warming could cause the great West Antarctic ice sheet to melt, which would 
raise sea levels by as much as 6 m. In February and March 2002, a mass of ice larger than the state 
of Rhode Island became detached from the Antarctic Peninsula, raising fears that the Antarctic ice 
sheet may be melting relatively rapidly.
The measurement of sea levels has proven to be a diffi  cult task because the levels of the surface of 
land keep changing. Land most recently covered with Ice Age glaciers in areas such as Scandinavia 
is still “springing back” from the immense mass of the glaciers, so that sea levels measured by gauges The Geosphere and Geochemistry 409

An opposite situation exists on the east coast of North America where land was pushed outward and 
raised around the edge of the enormous sheet of ice that covered Canada and the northern United States 
about 20,000 years ago and is now settling back. Factors such as these illustrate the advantages of 
remarkably accurate satellite technology now used in the determination of sea levels.
15.15 PHENOMENA AT THE LAND/ATMOSPHERE INTERFACE
The interface between the atmosphere and land is a boundary of intense environmental activity. 
The combined effects of air and water tend to cause signifi  cant changes to the land materials at this 
interface. The top layer of exposed land is especially susceptible to physical and chemical weather-
ing. Here, air laden with oxidant oxygen contacts rock, originally formed under reducing conditions, 
causing oxidation reactions to occur. Acid naturally present in rainwater as dissolved CO2 or present 
as pollutant sulfuric, sulfurous, nitric, or hydrochloric acid can dissolve portions of some kinds of 
rocks. Organisms such as lichens, which consist of fungi and algae growing symbiotically on rock 
surfaces, drawing carbon dioxide, oxygen, or nitrogen from air can grow on rock surfaces at the 
boundary of the atmosphere and geosphere, causing additional weathering to take place.
One of the most signifi  cant agents affecting exposed geospheric solids at the atmosphere/geo-
sphere boundary is wind. Consisting of air moving largely in a horizontal fashion, wind both erodes 
solids and acts as an agent to deposit solids on geospheric surfaces. The infl  uence of wind is espe-
cially pronounced in dry areas. A major factor in wind erosion is wind abrasions  in which solid 
particles of sand and rock carried by wind tend to wear away exposed rock and soil. Loose, uncon-
solidated sand and soil may be removed in large volumes by wind, a process called defl  ation .
The potential for wind to move matter is illustrated by the formation of large deposits of loess , 
consisting of fi  nely divided soil carried by wind. Loess particles are typically several tens of 
micrometers in size, small enough to be carried great distances by wind. Especially common are 
loess deposits that originated with matter composed of rock ground to a fi  ne fl our by ice age  glaciers. 
This material was fi  rst deposited in river valleys by fl  ood waters issuing from melting glaciers and 
then blown some distance from the rivers by strong winds after drying out.
One of the more common geospheric features created by wind is a dune , consisting of a mound 
of debris, usually sand, dropped when wind slows down. When a dune begins to form, it forms an 
obstruction that slows wind even more, so that more sediment is dropped. The result is that in the 
presence of sediment-laden wind, dunes several meters or more high may form rapidly. In forming 
a dune, heavier, coarser particles settle fi  rst so that the matter in dunes is sorted according to size, 
just like sediments deposited by fl  owing streams. In areas where winds are prevalently from one 
direction, as is usually the case, dunes show a typical shape as illustrated in Figure 15.12. It is seen 
that the steeply sloping side, called the slip face , is downwind.
Some of the environmental effects of dunes result from their tendency to migrate with the 
 prevailing winds. Migration occurs as matter is blown by the wind up the gently sloping face of 
the dune and falls down the slip face. Migrating sand dunes have inundated forest trees, and dust 
dunes in drought-stricken agricultural areas have fi  lled road ditches, causing sharply increased 
maintenance costs.
15.16 EFFECTS OF ICE
The power of ice to alter the geosphere is amply demonstrated by the remains of past glacial activity 
from the Ice Age. Those large areas of the Earth’s surface that were once covered with layers of 
glacial ice 1 or 2 km in thickness show evidence of how the ice carved the surface, left massive piles 
of rock and gravel, and left rich deposits of freshwater. The enormous weight of glaciers on the 
Earth’s surface compressed it, and in places it is still springing back 10,000 or so years after the 
glaciers retreated. Today the infl  uence of ice on the Earth’s surface is much less than it was during 410 Environmental Chemistry
the Ice Age, and there is substantial concern that melting of glaciers by greenhouse warming will 
raise sea levels so high that coastal areas will be inundated.
Glaciers form at suffi  ciently high latitudes and altitudes such that snow does not melt completely 
each summer. This occurs when snow becomes compacted over several years to several thousand 
years such that the frozen water turns to crystals of true ice. Huge masses of ice with areas of several 
thousand square kilometers or more, and often around 1 km thick, occur in polar regions and are 
called continental glaciers . Both Greenland and the Antarctic are covered by continental glaciers. 
Alpine glaciers  occupy mountain valleys.
Glaciers on a slope fl  ow as a consequence of their mass. This rate of fl  ow is usually only a few 
meters per year, but may reach several kilometers per year. If a glacier fl  ows into the sea, it may lose 
masses of ice as icebergs, a process called calving . Ice may also be lost by melting along the edges. 
The processes by which ice is lost are termed ablation .
Glacial ice affects the surface of the geosphere by both erosion and deposition. It is easy to imag-
ine that a fl  owing mass of glacial ice is very effi  cient in scraping away the surface over which it 
fl ows, a process called abrasion . Adding to the erosive effect is the presence of rocks frozen into the 
glaciers, which can act like tools to carve the surface of the underlying rock and soil. Whereas abra-
sion tends to wear rock surfaces away producing a fi  ne rock powder, larger bits of rock can be dis-
lodged from the surface over which the glacier fl  ows and be carried along with the glacial ice.
When glacial ice melts, the rock that has been incorporated into it is left behind. This material is 
called till, or if it has been carried for some distance by water running off the melting glacier it is 
called outwash . Piles of rock left by melting glaciers produce unique structures called moraines .
Although the effects of glaciers described above are the most spectacular manifestations of the 
action of ice on the geosphere, at a much smaller level ice can have some very substantial effects. 
Freezing and expansion of water in pores and small crevices in rock are a major contributor to physi-
cal weathering processes. Freeze/thaw cycles are also very destructive to some kinds of structures, 
such as stone buildings.
15.17 EFFECTS OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES
Human activities have profound effects on the geosphere. Such effects may be obvious and direct, 
such as strip mining, or rearranging vast areas for construction projects, such as roads and dams. 
Or the effects may be indirect, such as pumping so much water from underground aquifers that the 
ground subsides, or abusing soil such that it no longer supports plant life well and erodes. As the 
source of minerals and other resources used by humans, the geosphere is dug up, tunneled, stripped 
bare, rearranged, and subjected to many other kinds of indignities. The land is often severely

 disturbed, air can be polluted with dust particles during mining, and water may be polluted. Many of 
these effects, such as soil erosion caused by human activities, are addressed elsewhere in this book.
15.17.1  EXTRACTION  OF GEOSPHERIC  RESOURCES : SURFACE  MINING
Many human effects on the geosphere are associated with the extraction of resources from the 
Earth’s crust. This is done in a number of ways, the most damaging of which can be surface min-
ing. Surface mining is employed in the United States to extract virtually all of the rock and gravel 
that is mined, well over half of the coal, and numerous other resources. Properly done, with appro-
priate restoration practices, surface mining does minimal damage and may even be used to improve 
surface quality, such as by the construction of surface reservoirs where rock or gravel have been 
extracted. In earlier times before strict reclamation laws were in effect, surface mining, particu-
larly of coal, left large areas of land scarred, devoid of vegetation, and subject to erosion.
Several approaches are employed in surface mining. Sand and gravel located under water are 
extracted by dredging  with draglines or chain buckets attached to large conveyers. In most cases 
resources are covered with an overburden  of earthen material that does not contain any of the 
resource that is being sought. This material must be removed as spoil . Open-pit mining  is, as the 
name implies, a procedure in which gravel, building stone, iron ore, and other materials are simply 
dug from a big hole in the ground. Some of these pits, such as several from which copper ore has 
been taken in the United States, are truly enormous in size.
The most well-known (sometimes infamous) method of surface mining is strip mining , in which 
strips of overburden are removed by draglines and other heavy earth-moving equipment to expose 
seams of coal, phosphate rock, or other materials. Heavy equipment is used to remove a strip of 
overburden, and the exposed mineral resource is removed and hauled away. Overburden from a 
parallel strip is then removed and placed over the previously mined strip, and the procedure is 
repeated numerous times. Older practices left the replaced overburden as relatively steep erosion-
prone banks. On highly sloping terrain, overburden is removed on progressively higher terraces and 
placed on the terrace immediately below.
15.17.2  ENVIRONMENTAL  EFFECTS  OF MINING AND MINERAL  EXTRACTION
Some of the environmental effects of surface mining have been mentioned above. Although surface 
mining is most often considered for its environmental effects, subsurface mining may also have a 
number of effects, some of which are not immediately apparent and may be delayed for decades. 
Underground mines have a tendency to collapse, leading to severe subsidence. Mining disturbs 
groundwater aquifers. Water seeping through mines and mine tailings may become polluted. One of 
the more common and damaging effects of mining on water occurs when pyrite, FeS2, commonly 
associated with coal, is exposed to air and becomes oxidized to sulfuric acid by bacterial action to 
produce acid mine water (see Section 6.14). Some of the more damaging environmental effects of 
mining are the result of the processing of mined materials. Usually, ore is only part, often a small 
part, of the material that must be excavated. Various benefi  ciation  processes are employed to separate 
the useful fraction of ore, leaving a residue of tailings . A number of adverse effects can result from 
environmental exposure of tailings. For example, residues left from the benefi  ciation of coal are often 
enriched with pyrite, FeS2, which is oxidized microbiologically and chemically to produce damaging 
acidic drainage (acid mine water). Uranium ore tailings unwisely used as fi  ll material have contami-
nated buildings with radioactive radon gas.
15.18 AIR POLLUTION AND THE GEOSPHERE
The geosphere can be a signifi  cant source of air pollutants. Of these geospheric sources, volcanic 
activity is one of the most common. Volcanic eruptions, fumaroles, hot springs, and geysers can 412 Environmental Chemistry
emit toxic and acidic gases, including carbon monoxide, hydrogen chloride, and hydrogen sulfi  de. 
Greenhouse gases that tend to increase global climatic warming—carbon dioxide and methane—
can come from volcanic sources. Massive volcanic eruptions may inject huge amounts of particulate 
matter into the atmosphere. The incredibly enormous 1883 eruption of the East Indies volcano 
Krakatoa blew about 2.5 km3 of solid matter into the atmosphere, some of which penetrated well 
into the stratosphere. This material stayed aloft long enough to circle Earth several times, causing 
red sunsets and a measurable lowering of temperature worldwide.
The 1982 eruption of the southern Mexico volcano El Chicón showed the importance of the type 
of particulate matter in determining effects on climate. The matter given off by this eruption was 
unusually rich in sulfur, so that an aerosol of sulfuric acid formed and persisted in the atmosphere 
for about 3 years, during which time the mean global temperature was lowered by several tenths of 
a degree due to the presence of atmospheric sulfuric acid. By way of contrast, the eruption of Mount 
St. Helens in Washington State in the United States 2 years earlier had little perceptible effect on 
climate, although the amount of material blasted into the atmosphere was about the same as that 
from El Chicón. The material from the Mount St Helens eruption had comparatively little sulfur in 
it, so the climatic effects were minimal.
Thermal smelting processes used to convert metal fractions in ore into usable forms have caused 
a number of severe air pollution problems that have affected the geosphere. Many metals are present 
in ores as sulfi  des, and smelting can release large quantities of sulfur dioxide, as well as particles that 
contain heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium, or lead. The resulting acid and heavy metal pollu-
tion of surrounding land can cause severe damage to vegetation so that devastating erosion occurs. 
One such area is around a large nickel smelter in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, where a large area of 
land has become denuded of vegetation. Similar dead zones have been produced by copper smelters 
in Tennessee and in eastern Europe, including the former Soviet Union. 
Soil and its cultivation produce signifi  cant quantities of atmospheric emissions. Waterlogged 
soil, particularly that cultivated for rice, generates signifi  cant quantities of methane, a greenhouse 
gas. The microbial reduction of nitrate in soil releases nitrous oxide, N2O, to the atmosphere. 
However, soil and rock can also remove atmospheric pollutants. It is believed that microorganisms 
in soil account for the loss from the atmosphere of some carbon monoxide, which some fungi and 
bacteria can metabolize. Carbonate rocks, such as calcium carbonate, CaCO3, can neutralize acid 
from atmospheric sulfuric acid and acid gases.
As discussed in Section 9.6, masses of atmospheric air can become trapped and stagnant 
under  conditions of a temperature inversion in which the vertical circulation of air is limited by the 
 presence of a relatively warm layer of air overlaying a colder layer at ground level. The effects of 
inversions can be aggravated by topographical conditions that tend to limit circulation of air. 
Figure 15.13 shows such a condition in which surrounding mountain ridges limit horizontal air 
movement. Air pollutants may be forced up a mountain ridge from a polluted area to signifi  cantly 
higher altitudes than they would otherwise reach. Because of this “chimney effect,” air pollutants 
may reach mountain pine forests that are particularly susceptible to damage from air pollutants such 
as ozone formed along with photochemical smog.
15.19 WATER POLLUTION AND THE GEOSPHERE
Water pollution is addressed in detail elsewhere in this book. Much water pollution arises from 
interactions of groundwater and surface water with the geosphere.7 These aspects are addressed 
briefl y here.
The relationship between water and the geosphere is twofold. The geosphere may be severely 
damaged by water pollution. This occurs, for example, when water pollutants produce contaminated 
sediments, such as those polluted by heavy metals or PCBs. In some cases the geosphere serves as 
a source of water pollutants. Examples include acid produced by exposed metal sulfi  des in the geo-
sphere or synthetic chemicals improperly discarded in landfi  lls and leaking into groundwater.The Geosphere and Geochemistry 413
The sources of water pollution are divided into two main categories. The fi  rst of these consists of 
point sources , which enter the environment at a single, readily identifi  ed entry point. An example of 
a point source would be a sewage water outfl  ow. Point sources tend to be those directly identifi  ed as 
having their origins from human activities. Nonpoint sources  of pollution are those from broader 
areas. Such a source is water contaminated by fertilizer from fertilized agricultural land, or water 
contaminated with excess alkali leached from alkaline soils. Nonpoint sources are relatively harder 
to identify and monitor. Pollutants associated with the geosphere are usually nonpoint sources.
An especially common and damaging geospheric source of w ater pollutants consists of sedi-
ments carried by water from land into the bottoms of bodies of water. Most such sediments originate 
from agricultural land that has been disturbed such that soil particles are eroded from land into 
water. The most common manifestation of sedimentary material in water is opacity, which seriously 
detracts from the esthetics of the water. Sedimentary material deposited in reservoirs or canals can 
clog them and eventually make them unsuitable for water supply, fl  ood control, navigation, and 
recreation. Suspended sediment in water used as a water supply can clog fi  lters and add signifi  cantly 
to the cost of treating the water. Sedimentary material can devastate wildlife habitats by reducing 
food supplies and ruining nesting sites. Turbidity in water can severely curtail photosynthesis, thus 
reducing primary productivity necessary to sustain the food chains of aquatic ecosystems. 
15.20 WASTE DISPOSAL AND THE GEOSPHERE
The geosphere receives many kinds and large amounts of wastes. Its ability to cope with such 
wastes with minimal damage is one of its most important characteristics and is dependent upon the 
kinds of wastes disposed of on it. A variety of wastes, ranging from large quantities of relatively 
innocuous municipal refuse to much smaller quantities of potentially lethal radioactive wastes, are 
deposited on land or in landfi  lls. These are addressed briefl  y in this section.
15.20.1  MUNICIPAL  REFUSE
The currently favored method for disposing of municipal solid wastes—household garbage—is in 
sanitary landfi  lls  (Figure 15.14) consisting of refuse piled on top of the ground or into a depression 
such as a valley, compacted, and covered at frequent intervals by soil. This approach permits fre-
quent covering of the refuse so that loss of blowing trash, water contamination, and other undesir-
able effects are minimized. A completed landfi  ll can be put to benefi  cial uses, such as a recreational 
area; because of settling, gas production, and other factors, landfi  ll surfaces are generally not Warmer Confining topography

FIGURE 15.13 Topographical features, such as confi  ning mountain ridges, may work with temperature 
inversions to increase the effects of air pollution.414 Environmental Chemistry
 suitable for building construction. Modern sanitary landfi  lls are much preferable to the open dump 
sites that were once the most common means of municipal refuse disposal.
Although municipal refuse is much less dangerous than hazardous chemical waste, it still poses 
some hazards. Despite prohibitions against the disposal of cleaners, solvents, lead storage batteries, 
and other potentially hazardous materials in landfi  lls, materials that pose some environmental 
 hazards do fi  nd their way into landfi  lls and can contaminate their surroundings.
Landfi  lls produce both gaseous and aqueous emissions. Biomass in landfi  lls quickly depletes 
oxygen by aerobic biodegradation of microorganisms in the landfi  ll,
 {CH2O} (biomass) + O2 Æ CO2 + H2O (15.8)
emitting carbon dioxide. Over a period of many decades the buried biodegradable materials undergo 
anaerobic biodegradation
 2{CH2O} Æ CO2 + CH4 (15.9)
releasing methane as well as carbon dioxide. Although often impractical and too expensive, it 
is desirable to reclaim the methane as fuel, and some large sanitary landfi  lls are major sources 
of methane. Released methane is a greenhouse gas and can pose signifi  cant explosion hazards 
to structures built on landfi  lls. Although produced in much smaller quantities than methane, hydro-
gen sulfi  de, H2S, is also generated by anaerobic biodegradation. This gas is toxic and has a bad odor. 
In a properly designed sanitary landfi  ll, hydrogen sulfi  de releases are small and the gas tends to 
oxidize before it reaches the atmosphere in signifi  cant quantities.
Water infi  ltrating into sanitary landfi  lls dissolves materials from the disposed refuse and runs off 
as leachate . Contaminated leachate is the single greatest potential pollution problem with refuse 
disposal sites, so it is important to minimize its production by designing landfi  lls in a way that keeps 
water infi  ltration as low as possible. The anaerobic degradation of biomass produces organic acids 
that give the leachate a tendency to dissolve acid-soluble solutes, such as heavy metals. Leachate can 
infi ltrate into groundwater posing severe contamination problems. This is minimized by siting sani-
tary landfi  lls over formations of poorly permeable clay or depositing layers of clay in the landfi  ll 
before refuse is put in it. In addition, impermeable synthetic polymer liners may be placed in the 
bottom of the landfi  ll. In areas of substantial rainfall, infi  ltration into the landfi  ll exceeds its capac-
ity to hold water so that leachate fl  ows out. In order to prevent water pollution downstream, this 
leachate should be controlled and treated.
Hazardous chemical wastes are disposed of in the so-called secure landfi  lls , which are designed 
to prevent leakage and geospheric contamination of toxic chemicals disposed of in them. Such a

FIGURE 15.14 Structure of a sanitary landfi  ll.The Geosphere and Geochemistry 415
landfi  ll is equipped with a variety of measures to prevent contamination of groundwater and the 
surrounding geosphere. The base of the landfi  ll is made of compacted clay that is largely imperme-
able to leachate. An impermeable polymer liner is placed over the clay liner. The surface of the 
landfi  ll is covered with material designed to reduce water infi  ltration, and the surface is designed 
with slopes that also minimize the amount of water running in. Elaborate drainage systems are 
installed to collect and treat leachate.
The most pressing matter pertaining to geospheric disposal of wastes involves radioactive wastes. 
Most of these wastes are low-level  wastes, including discarded radioactive laboratory chemicals and 
pharmaceuticals, fi  lters used in nuclear reactors, and ion-exchange resins used to remove small 
q u an ti ti e s  o f  r a di o n u c li d e s  fr o m  n u c l e ar  r e a c t o r  c o o l e r  w a t e r .  D i s p o s e d  o f  in  p r o p e r l y  d e s i gn e d  
landfi  lls, such wastes pose minimal hazards.
Of greater concern are the high-level  radioactive wastes, primarily fi  ssion products of nuclear 
power reactors and by-products of nuclear weapons manufacture. Many of these wastes are cur-
rently stored as solutions in tanks, many of which have outlived their useful lifetimes and pose 
leakage hazards, at sites such as the federal nuclear facility at Hanford, Washington, where pluto-
nium was generated in large quantities during post-World War II years. Eventually, such wastes 
must be placed in the geosphere such that they will pose no hazards. Numerous proposals have been 
advanced for their disposal, including disposal in salt formations, subduction zones in the seafl  oor, 
and ice sheets. The most promising sites appear to be those in poorly permeable formations of igne-
ous rock. Among these are basalts, which are strong, glassy igneous types of rock found in the 
Columbia River plateau. Granite and pyroclastic welded tuffs fused by past high-temperature 
 volcanic eruptions are other possibilities as sites for disposing of nuclear wastes and keeping them 
isolated for tens of thousands of years.

Environmental Chemistry
16.1 SOIL AND AGRICULTURE
Because of its role in supporting plant growth, soil is a crucial part of the geosphere. Like the very 
sparse layer of stratospheric ozone that is essential to protect terrestrial organisms from destructive 
solar ultraviolet radiation, the layer of soil on the earth’s surface is extremely thin. If Earth were the 
size of a geography-class globe, the average thickness of productive soil on its surface would be less 
than that of a human cell! Because of its importance in sustainability and its fragile nature, soil and 
production of food and materials from it are discussed in some detail in this chapter.
Soil and agricultural practices are strongly tied with the environment and sustainability. Some of 
these considerations are addressed later in this chapter along with a discussion of soil erosion and 
conservation. Cultivation of land and agricultural practices along with other anthrospheric activities 
strongly infl  uence the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, and the biosphere. Although this chapter deals 
primarily with soil, the topic of agriculture in general is introduced for perspective.
Although the most obvious use of soil is for plant growth leading to food production, it serves 
many functions in the maintenance of sustainability. It holds water, regulates water supplies, and 
s e rv e s  as  a  m edi um  t o  fi  lter and conduct water from precipitation into groundwater aquifers. It 
serves to recycle raw materials and nutrients. It is a habitat for a large variety of organisms, espe-
cially fungi and bacteria. Soil interfaces with the anthrosphere as an engineering medium that is 
dug up, moved, and smoothed over to make roads, dams, and other engineering constructs.
The study of soil is called pedology  or, more simply, soil science . To humans and most terrestrial 
organisms, soil is the most important part of the geosphere. Though only a tissue-thin layer com-
pared to the earth’s total diameter, soil is the medium that produces most of the food required by 
most living things. Good soil—and a climate conducive to its productivity—is the most valuable 
asset a society can have.
In addition to being the site of most food production, soil is the receptor of large quantities of 
pollutants, such as particulate matter from power plant smokestacks. Fertilizers, pesticides, and some 
other materials applied to soil often contribute to water and air pollution. Therefore, soil is a key 
component of environmental chemical cycles. It is a valuable part of the earth’s natural capital.
Soil itself can become an air or water pollutant, especially when it has been abused by poor agri-
cultural practices, deforestation, or desertifi  cation. Fine soil particles make up a large fraction of the 
matter in yellow clouds described as massive air pollution phenomena in Chapter 15. Furthermore, 
topsoil washed into streams and bodies of water by water erosion can be deposited as damaging 
sediments.
16.1.1 A GRICULTURE
Agriculture , the production of food by growing crops and livestock, provides for the most basic of 
human needs. No other industry impacts as much as agriculture does on the environment. Agriculture 
is absolutely essential for the maintenance of the huge human populations now on Earth. The 420 Environmental Chemistry
displacement of native plants, destruction of wildlife habitat, erosion, pesticide pollution, and other 
environmental aspects of agriculture have enormous potential for environmental damage. Survival 
of humankind on Earth demands environmentally friendly and sustainable agricultural practices. 
On the other hand, growth of domestic crops removes (at least temporarily) greenhouse gas carbon 
dioxide from the atmosphere and provides potential sources of renewable resources of energy and 
fi ber that can substitute for petroleum-derived fuels and materials.
Agriculture can be divided into the two main categories of crop farming , in which plant photo-
synthesis is used to produce food and fi  ber, and livestock farming , in which domesticated animals 
are grown for meat, milk, and other animal products. Crop farming produces food consumed 
directly by humans, food for livestock, and fi  ber. Livestock farming involves the raising of animals 
for meat, dairy products, eggs, wool, and hides. Freshwater fi  sh and even crayfi  sh are raised on “fi  sh 
farms.” Beekeeping provides honey.
Agriculture is based on domestic plants engineered by early farmers from their wild plant 
ancestors. Without perhaps much of an awareness of what they were doing, early farmers selected 
plants with desired characteristics for the production of food. This selection of plants for domestic 
use brought about evolutionary change so profound that the products often barely resembled their 
wild ancestors. Plant breeding based on scientifi  c principles of heredity is a very recent develop-
ment dating from around 1900. One of the major objectives of plant breeding has been to increase 
yield. Yields of crops can also be increased by selecting for resistance to insects, drought, and cold. 
In some cases, the goal is to increase nutritional value, such as raising the content of essential 
amino acids.
The development of hybrids has vastly increased yields and other desired characteristics of a 
number of important crops. Basically , hybrids  are the offspring of crosses between two different 
true-breeding  strains. Often quite different from either parent strain, hybrids tend to exhibit “hybrid 
vigor” and to have signifi  cantly higher yields. The most success with hybrid crops has been obtained 
with corn (maize). Corn is one of the easiest plants to hybridize because of the physical separation 
of the male fl  owers, which grow as tassels on top of the corn plant, from female fl  owers, which are 
attac hed to inci pi en t ears on the s i de o f the p lan t. Des pi te pas t s uccesses b y more con v en ti onal 
means and some early disappointments with “genetic engineering,” application of recombinant 
DNA technology (Section 16.13) will probably eventually overshadow all the advances ever made 
in plant breeding.
In addition to plant strains and varieties, numerous other factors are involved in crop production. 
Weather is an obvious factor and shortages of water, chronic in many areas of the world, are miti-
gated by irrigation. Here, automated techniques and computer control can play an important, more 
environmentally friendly role by minimizing the quantities of water required. The application of 
chemical fertilizer has vastly increased crop yields. The judicious application of pesticides, espe-
cially herbicides, but including insecticides and fungicides as well, has increased crop yields and 
reduced losses greatly. Use of herbicides has had an environmental benefi  t in reducing the degree of 
mechanical cultivation of soil required. Indeed, “no-till” and “low-till” agriculture (conservation 
tillage) are now widely practiced on a large scale.
The rearing of domestic animals may have signifi  cant environmental effects. Effl  uent from waste 
lagoons associated with concentrated livestock feeding operations can cause serious water pollution 
problems. Goats and sheep have destroyed pastureland in the Near East, Northern Africa, Portugal, 
and Spain. Of particular concern are the environmental effects of raising cattle. Signifi  cant amounts 
of forest land have been converted to marginal pasture land to raise beef. Production of one pound 
of beef requires about four times as much water and four times as much feed as does production of 
one pound of chicken. An interesting aspect of the problem is emission of greenhouse-gas methane 
by anaerobic bacteria in the digestive systems of cattle and other ruminant animals; cattle rank right 
behind wetlands and rice paddies as producers of atmospheric methane. However, because of the 
action of specialized bacteria in their stomachs, cattle and other ruminant animals are capable of 
converting otherwise unusable cellulose to food.Soil and Agricultural Environmental Chemistry 421
16.1.2 P ESTICIDES  AND AGRICULTURE
Pesticides, particularly insecticides and herbicides, are an integral part of modern agricultural 
production. In the United States, agricultural pesticides are regulated under the Federal Insecticide, 
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), fi  rst passed in 1947, revised in a major way in 1972, and 
subjected to several amendments since then. Pesticides are responsible for much of the high pro-
ductivity of modern agriculture as well as some of the major pollution problems associated with 
agriculture.
An interesting development regarding the use of herbicides in the late 1990s was the production 
of transgenic crops resistant to specifi  c herbicides. The Monsanto company pioneered this approach 
with the development of “Roundup Ready” crops that resist the herbicidal effects of Monsanto’s 
fl agship Roundup® herbicide (glyphosate). The seedlings of crops resistant to the herbicide are not 
harmed on exposure to it, whereas competing weeds are killed. Although sales of glyphosate have 
been greatly increased by Roundup Ready crops, especially soybeans, increased plantings of these 
crops has reduced the use of herbicides overall with a net overall benefi  t to the environment.
The use on transgenic crops of glyphosate, for which the structural formula is shown in Chapter 7, 
Figure 7.14, has made it a uniquely important product, the most widely produced pesticide in the 
world. Glyphosate binds strongly to soil colloids and is readily degraded by soil microorganisms. 
The properties of glyphosate make it diffi  cult to measure in soil and water samples. The molecule 
is very polar and soluble in water, but not soluble in organic solvents commonly used to extract 
pollutants for analysis. It binds strongly to metal ions as well as organic, mineral, and clay solids 
making its isolation diffi  cult. Because of glyphosate’s structural similarity to naturally occurring 
amino acids and other plant biomolecules, there are numerous interferences in its determination.
16.2 NATURE AND COMPOSITION OF SOIL
Soil, a variable mixture of minerals, organic matter, and water capable of supporting plant life on 
the earth’s surface, is the most fundamental requirement for agriculture. It is the fi  nal product of the 
weathering action of physical, chemical, and biological processes on rocks, which largely produces 
clay minerals. The organic portion of soil consists of plant biomass in various stages of decay. High 
populations of bacteria, fungi, and animals such as earthworms may be found in soil. Soil contains 
air spaces and generally has a loose texture (Figure 16.1).

FIGURE 16.1 Fine structure of soil, showing solid, water, and air phases.422 Environmental Chemistry
The solid fraction of typical productive soil is approximately 5% organic matter and 95% inor-
ganic matter. Some soils, such as peat soils, may contain as much as 95% organic material. Other 
soils contain as little as 1% organic matter.
Typical soils exhibit distinctive layers called horizons , with increasing depth (Figure 16.2). 
Horizons form as a result of complex interactions among processes that occur during weathering. 
Rainwater percolating through soil carries dissolved and colloidal solids to lower horizons where 
they are deposited. Biological processes, such as bacterial decay of residual plant biomass, produce 
slightly acidic CO2, organic acids, and complexing compounds that are carried by rainwater to 
lower horizons where they interact with clays and other minerals, altering the properties of the min-
erals. The top layer of soil, typically several inches in thickness, is known as the A horizon, or 
topsoil . This is the layer of maximum biological activity in the soil, contains most of the soil organic 
matter, and is essential for plant productivity. Various soils may have a variety of horizons, the main 
ones of which are described in Figure 16.2.
Soils exhibit a large variety of characteristics that are used for their classifi  cation for various 
purposes, including crop production, road construction, and waste disposal. Soil profi  les are discussed 
above. The parent rocks from which soils are formed obviously play a strong role in determining 
the composition of soils. Other soil characteristics include strength, workability, soil particle size, 
permeability, and degree of maturity.
16.2.1 W ATER AND AIR IN SOIL
Large quantities of water are required for the production of most plant materials. For example, 
several hundred kilograms of water are required to produce 1 kg of dry hay. Water is part of the 
three-phase, solid−liquid−gas system making up soil. It is the basic transport medium for carrying 
essential plant nutrients from solid soil particles into plant roots and to the farthest reaches of the 
plant’s leaf structure (Figure 16.3). The water in a plant evaporates into the atmosphere from the 
plant’s leaves, a process called transpiration .
Normally, because of the small size of soil particles and the presence of small capillaries and pores 
in the soil, the water phase is not totally independent of soil solid matter. The availability of water to 
plants is governed by gradients arising from capillary and gravitational forces. The availability of Vegetation

nutrient solutes in water depends upon concentration gradients and electrical potential gradients. 
Water present in larger spaces of soil is relatively more available to plants and readily drains away. 
Water held in smaller pores or between the unit layers of clay particles is held much more strongly. 
Soils high in organic matter may hold appreciably more water than other soils, but it is relatively less 
available to plants because of physical and chemical sorption of the water by the organic matter.
There is a very strong interaction between clays and water in soil. Water is absorbed on the 
surfaces of clay particles. Because of the high surface/v olume ratio of colloidal clay particles, a 
great deal of water may be bound in this manner. Water is also held between the unit layers of the 
expanding clays, such as the montmorillonite clays. As soil becomes waterlogged (water-saturated), 
it undergoes drastic changes in physical, chemical, and biological properties. Oxygen in such soil is 
rapidly used up by the respiration of microorganisms that degrade soil organic matter. In such soils, 
the bonds holding soil colloidal particles together are broken, which causes disruption of soil struc-
ture. Thus, the excess water in such soils is detrimental to plant growth, and the soil does not contain 
the air required by most plant roots. Most useful crops, with the notable exception of rice, cannot 
grow on waterlogged soils.
One of the most marked chemical effects of waterlogging is a reduction of p E b y  th e  ac ti o n  o f 
organic reducing agents acting through bacterial catalysts. Thus, the redox condition of the soil becomes 
much more reducing, and the soil p E may drop from that of water in equilibrium with air ( +13.6 at pH 7) 
to 1 or less. One of the more signifi  cant results of this change is the mobilization of iron and manganese 
as soluble iron(II) and manganese(II) through reduction of their insoluble higher oxides:
 MnO2 + 4H+ + 2e- Æ Mn2+ + 2H2O  (16.1)
 Fe2O3 + 6H+ + 2e- Æ 2Fe2+ + 3H2O  (16.2)

FIGURE 16.3 Plants transport water from the soil to the atmosphere by transpiration. Nutrients are also 
carried from the soil to the plant extremities by this process. Plants remove CO2 from the atmosphere and add 
O2 by photosynthesis. The reverse occurs during plant respiration.424 Environmental Chemistry
Although soluble manganese is generally found in soil as Mn2+ ion, soluble iron(II) occurs 
 frequently as negatively charged iron−organic chelates. Strong chelation of iron(II) by soil fulvic 
acids (Chapter 3) apparently enables reduction of iron(III) oxides at more positive p E values than 
would otherwise be possible. This causes an upward shift in the Fe(II)−Fe(OH)3 boundary as shown 
in Figure 4.4.
Some soluble metal ions such as Fe2+ and Mn2+ are toxic to plants at high levels. Their oxidation 
to insoluble oxides may cause formation of deposits of Fe2O3 and MnO2, which clog tile drains 
in fi elds.
Roughly 35% of the volume of typical soil is composed of air-fi  lled pores. Whereas the normal 
dry atmosphere at sea level contains 21% O2 and 0.04% CO2 by volume, these percentages may be 
quite different in soil air because of the decay of organic matter:
 {CH2O} + O2 Æ CO2 + H2O (16.3)
This process consumes oxygen and produces CO2. As a result, the oxygen content of air in soil may 
be as low as 15% and the carbon dioxide content may be several percent higher. Thus, the decay of 
organic matter in soil increases the equilibrium level of dissolved CO2 in groundwater. This lowers 
the pH and contributes to weathering of carbonate minerals, particularly calcium carbonate (see 
Reaction 3.7). As discussed in Section 16.3, CO2 also shifts the equilibrium of the process by which 
roots absorb metal ions from soil.
16.2.2 T HE INORGANIC  COMPONENTS  OF SOIL
The weathering of parent rocks and minerals to form the inorganic soil components results ulti-
mately in the formation of inorganic colloids. These colloids are repositories of water and plant 
nutrients, which may be made available to plants as needed. Inorganic soil colloids often absorb 
toxic substances in soil, thus playing a role in detoxifi  cation of substances that otherwise would 
harm plants. The abundance and nature of inorganic colloidal material in soil are obviously impor-
tant factors in determining soil productivity.
The uptake of plant nutrients by roots often involves complex interactions with the water and 
inorganic phases. For example, a nutrient held by inorganic colloidal material has to traverse the 
mineral/water interface and then the water/root interface. This process is often strongly infl  uenced 
by the ionic structure of soil inorganic matter.
As noted in Section 15.2, the most common elements on the earth’s crust are oxygen, silicon, 
aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium. Therefore, minerals composed of 
these elements—particularly silicon and oxygen—constitute most of the mineral fraction of the 
soil. Common soil mineral constituents are fi  nely divided quartz (SiO2), orthoclase (KAlSi3O8), 
albite (NaAlSi3O8), epidote (4CaO  . 3(AlFe)2O3 . 6SiO2 . H2O), geothite (FeO(OH)), magnetite 
(Fe3O4), calcium and magnesium carbonates (CaCO3, CaCO3 . MgCO3), and oxides of manganese 
and titanium.
16.2.3 O RGANIC  MATTER IN SOIL
Though typically comprising <5% of a productive soil, organic matter largely determines soil 
productivity. It serves as a source of food for microorganisms, undergoes chemical reactions such 
as ion exchange, and infl  uences the physical properties of soil. Some organic compounds even con-
tribute to the weathering of mineral matter, the process by which soil is formed. For example, 
C2O42-, oxalate ion, produced as a soil fungi metabolite, occurs in soil as the calcium salts whewel-
lite and weddelite. Oxalate in soil water dissolves minerals, thus speeding the weathering process Soil and Agricultural Environmental Chemistry 425
and increasing the availability of nutrient ion species. This weathering process involves oxalate 
complexation of iron or aluminum in minerals, represented by the reaction
 3H+
 + M(OH)3(s) + 2CaC2O4(s) Æ M(C2O4)2-(aq) + 2Ca2+(aq) + 3H2O  (16.4)
in which M is Al or Fe. Some soil fungi produce citric acid and other chelating organic acids that 
react with silicate minerals and release potassium and other nutrient metal ions held by these 
minerals.

is produced by some soil bacteria. By solubilizing metal ions, it may contribute to the weathering of 
minerals. It may also be involved in the release of phosphate from insoluble phosphate compounds.
Biologically active components of the organic soil fraction include polysaccharides, amino sug-
ars, nucleotides, and organic sulfur and phosphorus compounds. Humus, a water-insoluble material 
that biodegrades very slowly, makes up the bulk of soil organic matter. The organic compounds in 
soil are summarized in Table 16.1.
The accum ulati on o f org ani c matter in so il is s tron gl y infl  uenced by temperature and by the 
availability of oxygen. Since the rate of biodegradation decreases with decreasing temperature, 
organic matter does not degrade rapidly in colder climates and tends to build up in soil. In water and 
in waterlogged soils, decaying vegetation does not have easy access to oxygen, and organic matter 
accumulates. The organic content may reach 90% in areas where plants grow and decay in soil satu-
rated with water.
The presence of naturally occurring polynuclear aromatic (PAH) compounds is an interesting 
feature of soil organic matter. These compounds, some of which are carcinogenic, are discussed as 
air pollutants in Chapters 10 and 12. PAH compounds found in soil include fl  uoranthene, pyrene, 
and chrysene. PAH compounds in soil result from combustion from both natural sources (grass 
fi res) or pollutant sources. Terpenes and plant pigments, such as b-carotene, also occur in soil 
organic matter.

16.2.4 S OIL HUMUS
Of the organic components listed in Table 16.1, soil humus  is by far the most signifi  cant.1 Humus, 
composed of a base-soluble fraction called humic  and fulvic  acids (described in Section 3.17), and an 
insoluble fraction called humin , is the residue left when bacteria and fungi biodegrade plant material. 
The bulk of plant biomass consists of relatively degradable cellulose and degradation-resistant lignin, 
which is a polymeric substance with a higher carbon content than cellulose. Among lignin’s 
prominent chemical components are aromatic rings connected by alkyl chains, methoxyl groups, 
and hydroxyl groups. These structural artifacts occur in soil humus and give it many of its 
 characteristic properties.
The process by which humus is formed is called humifi  cation . Soil humus is similar to its lignin 
precursors, but has more carboxylic acid groups. Part of each molecule of humic substance is non-
polar and hydrophobic, and part is polar and hydrophilic. Such molecules are called amphiphiles , 
and they form micelles (see Section 5.4 and Figure 5.4) in which the nonpolar parts compose the 
inside of small colloidal particles and the polar functional groups are on the outside. Amphiphilic 
humic substances probably also form bilayer surface coatings on mineral grains in soil. During the 
humifi  cation process, the nitrogen/carbon ratio of the organic matter increases as carbon is lost to 
CO2 evolved during biodegradation and nitrogen fi  xed by nitrogen-fi  xing bacteria is incorporated 
into the humic residue.
Humic substances infl  uence soil properties to a degree out of proportion to their small percent-
age in soil. They strongly bind metals and serve to hold micronutrient metal ions in soil. Because of 
their acid–base character, humic substances serve as buffers in soil. The water-holding capacity of 
soil is signifi  cantly increased by humic substances. These materials also stabilize aggregates of soil 
particles and increase the sorption of organic compounds by soil. 
Humic materials in soil strongly sorb many solutes in soil water and have a particular affi  nity for 
heavy polyvalent cations. Soil humic substances may contain levels of uranium more than 104 times 
that of the water with which they are in equilibrium. Thus, water becomes depleted of its cations (or 
purifi  ed) in passing through humic-rich soils. Humic substances in soils also have a strong affi  nity 
for organic compounds with low water solubility such as DDT or atrazine, a herbicide widely used 
to kill weeds in corn fi  elds (see structural formula in Chapter 7, Figure 7.12).
In some cases, there is a strong interaction between the organic and inorganic portions of soil. 
This is especially true of the strong complexes formed between clays and humic (fulvic) acid com-
pounds. In many soils, 50−100% of soil carbon is complexed with clay. These complexes play a role 
in determining the physical properties of soil, soil fertility, and stabilization of soil organic matter. 
One of the mechanisms for the chemical binding between clay colloidal particles and humic organic 
particles is probably of the fl  occulation type (see Chapter 5) in which anionic organic molecules 
with carboxylic acid functional groups serve as bridges in combination with cations to bind clay 
colloidal particles together as a fl  oc. Support is given to this hypothesis by the known ability of 
NH4+, Al3+, Ca2+, and Fe3+ cations to stimulate clay−organic complex formation. The synthesis, 
chemical reactions, and biodegradation of humic materials are affected by interaction with clays. 
The lower-molecular-mass fulvic acids may be bound to clay, occupying spaces in layers in the clay.
16.2.5 T HE SOIL SOLUTION
The soil solution  is the aqueous portion of soil that contains dissolved matter from soil chemical and 
biochemical processes in soil and from exchange with the hydrosphere and biosphere. This medium 
transports chemical species to and from soil particles and provides intimate contact between the 
solutes and the soil particles. In addition to providing water for plant growth, it is an essential path-
way for the exchange of plant nutrients between roots and solid soil.
A major challenge with respect to soil solution is obtaining a sample of it. The most straight-
forward means is collection of drainage water, but that may miss soil solution bound in capillaries Soil and Agricultural Environmental Chemistry 427
and on surface fi  lms . Pres s ure/ v ac u um treatme n t, ce n trifu g ati o n, o r di s p l ace me n t wi th an o ther  
liquid may be employed.
Most of the solutes in soil are present as salts composed of H+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and Na+ cations 
(with lower levels of Fe2+, Mn2+, and Al3+) and HCO3-, CO32-, HSO4-, SO42-, Cl-, and F- anions. The Fe2+, 
Mn2+, and Al3+ cations are generally present in hydrolyzed forms or bound with humic substances. 
Some anions become bound with H+ (e.g., HCO3- formed from CO32-). Multicharged ions tend to form 
ion pairs in solution such as CaSO4(aq).
16.3 ACID–BASE AND ION-EXCHANGE REACTIONS IN SOILS
One of the more important chemical functions of soils is the exchange of cations. As discussed in 
Chapter 5, the capacity of a sediment or soil to exchange cations is expressed as the CEC, the num-
ber of meq of monovalent cations that can be exchanged per 100 g of soil (on a dry-weight basis). 
The CEC should be looked upon as a conditional constant since it may vary with soil conditions 
such as p E and pH. Both the mineral and organic portions of soils exchange cations. Clay minerals 
exchange cations because of the presence of negatively charged sites on the mineral, resulting 
from the substitution of an atom of lower oxidation number for one of higher number, for example, 
magnesium for aluminum. Organic materials exchange cations because of the presence of the 
carboxylate group and other basic functional groups. Humus typically has a very high CEC. The 
CEC of peat may range from 300 to 400 meq/100 g. Values of CEC for soils with more typical levels 
of organic matter are around 10−30 meq/100 g.
Cation exchange in soil is the mechanism by which potassium, calcium, magnesium, and essen-
tial trace-level metals are made available to plants. When nutrient metal ions are taken up by plant 
roots, hydrogen ion is exchanged for the metal ions. This process, plus the leaching of calcium, 
magnesium, and other metal ions from the soil by water containing carbonic acid, tends to make the 
soil acidic:
 {Soil}Ca2+ + 2CO2 + 2H2O Æ {Soil}(H+)2 + Ca2+(root) + 2HCO3- (16.5)
Soil acts as a buffer and resists changes in pH. The buffering capacity depends upon the type of soil.
The oxidation of pyrite, FeS2, in soil causes formation of acid-sulfate soils, sometimes called 
“cat clays”:
 ++ -++ Æ ++22 7
22 2 4 2 FeS O H O Fe 2H 2SO (16.6)
Cat clay soils may have pH values as low as 3.0. These soils, which are commonly found in Delaware, 
Florida, New Jersey, and North Carolina, are formed when neutral or basic marine sediments con-
taining FeS2 become acidic upon oxidation of pyrite when exposed to air. For example, soil reclaimed 
from marshlands and used for citrus groves has developed high acidity detrimental to plant growth. 
In addition, H2S released by reaction of FeS2 with acid is very toxic to citrus roots.
Soils are tested for potential acid-sulfate formation using a peroxide test. This test consists of 
oxidizing FeS2 in the soil with 30% H2O2,
 ++ -+Æ + + +32 15
22 2 42 2 FeS H O Fe H 2SO 7H O (16.7)
then testing for acidity and sulfate. Appreciable levels of sulfate and a pH below 3.0 indicate 
potential to form acid-sulfate soils. If the pH is above 3.0, either little FeS2 is present or suffi  cient 
CaCO3 is in the soil to neutralize the H2SO4 and acidic Fe3+.
Pyrite-containing mine spoils (residue left over from mining) also form soils similar to acid-
sulfate soils of marine origin.2 In addition to producing acid, pyrite wastes can evolve phyto-
toxic H2S.428 Environmental Chemistry
A phytotoxic agent associated with acidic soils is aluminum as the Al3+ ion.3 As the third most 
abundant element in the Earth’s crust and a major component of clays, aluminum is present in most 
soils. It poses no problem in alkaline or neutral soils in which aluminum is bound as insoluble forms 
such as Al(OH)3, but becomes toxic to plants in acidic soils that liberate soluble Al3+ ion. Aluminum 
toxicity to plants is a problem for the cultivation of approximately 8 billion acres of land worldwide 
that suffer from excess acidity, including about 86 million acres in the United States. It is believed that 
aluminum is toxic to plants because of its adverse effects on root tips. Barley is especially susceptible 
to the toxic effects of aluminum whereas wheat and corn tolerate the metal relatively well. These 
aluminum-tolerant plants apparently secrete an organic acid at their root tips that complexes Al3+ and 
prevents it from adversely affecting the roots. Through genetic engineering it may be possible to 
develop plant varieties that are aluminum-tolerant and make possible the cultivation of land that is 
otherwise unusable due to aluminum toxicity.
16.3.1 A DJUSTMENT  OF SOIL ACIDITY
Most common plants grow best in soil with a pH near neutrality. If the soil becomes too acidic for 
optimum plant growth, it may be restored to productivity by liming, ordinarily through the addition 
of calcium carbonate:
 {Soil}(H+)2 + CaCO3 Æ {Soil}Ca2+ + CO2 + H2O  (16.8)
In areas of low rainfall, soils may become too basic (alkaline) due to the presence of basic salts 
such as Na2CO3. Alkaline soils may be treated with aluminum or iron sulfate, which release acid on 
hydrolysis:
 2Fe3+ + 3SO42- + 6H2O Æ 2Fe(OH)3(s) + 6H+ + 3SO42-  (16.9)
Sulfur added to soils is oxidized by bacterially mediated reactions to sulfuric acid:
 2 3
22 4 2SO H O2 HS O+-++Æ+ (16.10)
and sulfur is used, therefore, to acidify alkaline soils. The huge quantities of sulfur now being 
removed from fossil fuels to prevent air pollution by sulfur dioxide may make the treatment of alka-
line soils by sulfur much more attractive economically.
16.3.2 I ON-EXCHANGE  EQUILIBRIA  IN SOIL
Competition of different cations for cation-exchange sites on soil cation exchangers may be described 
semiquantitatively by exchange constants. For example, soil reclaimed from an area fl  ooded with 
seawater will have most of its cation-exchange sites occupied by Na+, and restoration of fertility 
requires binding of nutrient cations such as K+:
 /arrowpairrightleft {Soil}Na K {Soil}K Na++ + +++ (16.11)
The exchange constant for this reaction is Kc,
 +
+=K
c
Na[Na ]
[K ]NKN (16.12)
which expresses the relative tendency of soil to retain K+ and Na+. In this equation, NK and NNa are 
the equivalent ionic fractions of potassium and sodium, respectively, bound to soil, and [Na+] and Soil and Agricultural Environmental Chemistry 429
[K+] are the concentrations of these ions in the surrounding soil water. For example, a soil with all 
cation-exchange sites occupied by Na+ would have a value of 1.00 for NNa; with one-half of the 
cation-exchange sites occupied by Na+, NNa is 0.5; and so on. The exchange of anions by soil is not 
so clearly defi  ned as is the exchange of cations. In many cases, the exchange of anions does not 
involve a simple ion-exchange process. This is true of the strong retention of orthophosphate species 
by soil. At the other end of the scale, nitrate ion is very weakly retained by the soil.
Anion exchange may be visualized as occurring at the surfaces of oxides in the mineral portion 
of soil. A mechanism for the acquisition of surface charge by metal oxides is shown in Chapter 5, 
Figure 5.5, using MnO2 as an example. At low pH, a metal oxide surface may have a net positive 
charge enabling it to hold anions, such as chloride, by electrostatic attraction as shown below where 
M represents a metal:
O 
OH2 M H+Cl–
At higher pH values, the metal oxide surface has a net negative charge due to the formation of OH- 
ion on the surface caused by loss of H+ from the water molecules bound to the surface:
O 
M OH–
In such cases, it is possible for anions such as HPO42- to displace hydroxide ion and bond directly to 
the oxide surface:
 O
M M OH– HPO42–O
OPO3H2–+ + OH– (16.13)
16.4 MACRONUTRIENTS IN SOIL
One of the most important functions of soil in supporting plant growth is to provide essential plant 
nutrients—macronutrients and micronutrients. Macronutrients are those elements that occur in 
substantial levels in plant biomass and fl  uids. Micronutrients (Section 16.6) are elements that are 
essential only at very low levels and generally are required for the functioning of essential enzymes.
The elements generally recognized as essential macronutrients for plants are carbon, hydrogen, 
oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. Carbon, hydrogen, and 
oxygen are obtained from the atmosphere. The other essential macronutrients must be obtained 
from soil. Of these, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are the most likely to be lacking and are 
commonly added to soil as fertilizers. Because of their importance, these elements are discussed 
separately in Section 16.5.
Calcium-defi  cient soils are relatively uncommon. Application of lime, a process used to treat 
acid soils (see Section 16.3), provides a more than adequate calcium supply for plants. However, 
calcium uptake by plants and leaching by carbonic acid (Reaction 16.5) may produce a calcium 
defi ciency in soil. Acid soils may still contain an appreciable level of calcium which, because of 
competition by hydrogen ion, is not available to plants. Treatment of acid soil to restore the pH to 
near neutrality generally remedies the calcium defi  ciency. In alkaline soils, the presence of high 
levels of sodium, magnesium, and potassium sometimes produces calcium defi  ciency because these 
ions compete with calcium for availability to plants.
Most of the 2.1% of magnesium in the earth’s crust is rather strongly bound in minerals. 
Exchangeable magnesium held by ion-exchanging organic matter or clays is considered available to 430 Environmental Chemistry
plants. The availability of magnesium to plants depends upon the calcium/magnesium ratio. If this 
ratio is too high, magnesium may not be available to plants and magnesium defi  ciency results. 
Similarly, excessive levels of potassium or sodium may cause magnesium defi  ciency.
Sulfur is assimilated by plants as the sulfate ion, SO42-. Soils defi  cient in sulfur do not support 
plant growth well, largely because sulfur is a component of some essential amino acids and of thia-
min and biotin. Sulfate ion is generally present in the soil as immobilized insoluble sulfate minerals 
or as soluble salts that are readily leached from the soil and lost as soil water runoff. Unlike the case 
of nutrient cations such as K+, little sulfate is adsorbed to the soil (i.e., bound by ion-exchange bind-
ing), where it is resistant to leaching while still available for assimilation by plant roots.
Soil sulfur defi  ciencies have been found in a number of regions of the world. Whereas most fertil-
izers used to contain sulfur, its use in commercial fertilizers has declined. With continued use of 
sulfur-defi  cient fertilizers, it is possible that sulfur will become a limiting nutrient in more cases.
As noted in Section 16.3, the reaction of FeS2 with acid in acid-sulfate soils may release H2S, 
which is very toxic to plants and which also kills many benefi  cial microorganisms. Toxic hydrogen 
sulfi de can also be produced by reduction of sulfate ion through microorganism-mediated reactions 
with organic matter. Production of hydrogen sulfi  de in fl  ooded soils may be inhibited by treatment 
with oxidizing compounds, one of the most effective of which is KNO3.
16.5 NITROGEN, PHOSPHORUS, AND POTASSIUM IN SOIL
Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are plant nutrients that are obtained from soil. They are 
s o  i m p o r t a n t  f o r  c r o p  p r o d u c t i v i t y  t h a t  t h e y  a r e  c o m m o n l y  a d d e d  t o  s o i l  a s  f e r t i l i z e r s .  T h e  
 environmental chemistry of these elements is discussed here and their production as fertilizers in 
Section 16.7.
16.5.1 N ITROGEN
Figure 16.4 summarizes the primary sinks and pathways of nitrogen in soil. In most soils, over 90% 
of the nitrogen content is organic. This organic nitrogen is primarily the product of the biodegrada-
tion of dead plants and animals. It is eventually hydrolyzed to NH4+, which can be oxidized to NO3- 
by the action of bacteria in the soil.
Nitrogen bound to soil humus is especially important in maintaining soil fertility. Unlike potas-
s i u m  o r  p h o s p h a t e ,  n i t r o g e n  i s  n o t  a  s i g n i fi  cant product of mineral weathering. Nitrogen-fi  xing

from fertilizers and rainwater is often largely lost by leaching. Soil humus, however, serves as a 
reservoir of nitrogen required by plants. It has the additional advantage that its rate of decay, hence 
its rate of nitrogen release to plants, roughly parallels plant growth—rapid during the warm growing 
season, slow during the winter months.
Nitrogen is an essential component of proteins and other constituents of living matter. Plants and 
cereals grown on nitrogen-rich soils not only provide higher yields, but are often substantially richer 
in protein and, therefore, more nutritious. Nitrogen is most generally available to plants as nitrate 
ion, NO3-. Some plants such as rice may utilize ammonium nitrogen; however, other plants are poi-
soned by this form of nitrogen. When nitrogen is applied to soils in the ammonium form, nitrifying 
bacteria perform an essential function in converting it to available nitrate ion.
Plants may absorb excessive amounts of nitrate nitrogen from soil. This phenomenon occurs 
particularly in heavily fertilized soils under drought conditions. Forage crops containing excessive 
amounts of nitrate can poison ruminant animals such as cattle or sheep. Plants having excessive 
levels of nitrate can endanger people when used for ensilage, an animal food consisting of fi  nely 
chopped plant material such as partially matured whole corn plants, fermented in a structure called 
silo. Under the reducing conditions of fermentation, nitrate in ensilage may be reduced to toxic NO2 
gas, which can accumulate to high levels in enclosed silos. There have been many cases reported of 
persons being killed by accumulated NO2 in silos.
Nitrogen fi  xation is the process by which atmospheric N2 is converted to nitrogen compounds 
available to plants. Human activities are resulting in the fi  xation of a great deal more nitrogen than 
would otherwise be the case. Artifi  cial sources now account for 30−40% of all nitrogen fi  xed. These 
include chemical fertilizer manufacture, nitrogen fi  xed during fuel combustion, combustion of 
nitrogen-containing fuels, and the increased cultivation of nitrogen-fi  xing legumes (see the follow-
ing paragraph). Of some concern with this increased fi  xation of nitrogen is the possible effect upon 
the atmospheric ozone layer by N2O released during denitrifi  cation of fi  xed nitrogen.
Before the widespread introduction of nitrogen fertilizers, soil nitrogen was provided primarily 
by legumes. These are plants such as soybeans, alfalfa, and clover, which contain on their root struc-
tures bacteria capable of fi  xing atmospheric nitrogen. Leguminous plants have a symbiotic (mutu-
ally advantageous) relationship with the bacteria that provide their nitrogen. Legumes may add 
signifi  cant quantities of nitrogen to soil, up to 10 pounds per acre per year, which is comparable to 
amounts commonly added as synthetic fertilizers. Soil fertility with respect to nitrogen may be 
maintained by rotating plantings of nitrogen-consuming plants with plantings of legumes, a fact 
recognized by agriculturists as far back as the Roman era.
The nitrogen-fi  xing bacteria in legumes exist in special structures on the roots called root nod-
ules (see Figure 16.5). The rod-shaped bacteria that fi  x nitrogen are members of a special genus, 
Seed pod
Root nodules where
nitrogen is fixed
FIGURE 16.5 A soybean plant, showing root nodules where nitrogen is fi  xed.432 Environmental Chemistry
Rhizobium . These bacteria may exist independently, but cannot fi  x nitrogen except in symbiotic 
combination with plants. Although all species of Rhizobium  appear to be very similar, they exhibit 
a great deal of specifi  city in their choice of host plants. Curiously, legume root nodules also contain 
a form of hemoglobin, which must somehow be involved in the nitrogen-fi  xation process. Some 
studies suggest that some kinds of Rhizobium bacteria secrete substances near plant roots that 
promote plant growth by secreting or causing the plants to release substances that facilitate the 
uptake of nutrients or inhibit plant pathogens.4
Nitrate pollution of some surface waters and groundwater has become a major problem in some 
agricultural areas (see Chapter 7). Although fertilizers have been implicated in such pollution, there 
is evidence that feedlots are a major source of nitrate pollution. The growth of livestock populations 
and the concentration of livestock in feedlots have aggravated the problem. Such concentrations of 
cattle, coupled with the fact that a steer produces approximately 18 times as much waste material as 
a human, have resulted in high levels of water pollution in rural areas with small human popula-
tions. Streams and reservoirs in such areas frequently are just as polluted as those in densely popu-
lated and highly industrialized areas.
Nitrate in farm wells is a common and especially damaging manifestation of nitrogen pollution 
from feedlots because of the susceptibility of ruminant animals to nitrate poisoning. The stomach 
contents of ruminant animals such as cattle and sheep constitute a reducing medium (low p E) and 
contain bacteria capable of reducing nitrate ion to toxic nitrite ion:
 NO3- + 2H+ + 2e- Æ NO2- + H2O  (16.14)
The origin of most nitrate produced from feedlot wastes is amino nitrogen present in nitrogen-
containing waste products. Approximately, one-half of the nitrogen excreted by cattle is contained 
in the urine. Part of this nitrogen is proteinaceous and the other part is in the form of urea, 
NH2CONH2. As a fi  rst step in the degradation process, the amino nitrogen is probably hydrolyzed 
to ammonia or ammonium ion:
 RNH2 + H2O Æ R-OH + NH3 (NH4+)  (16.15)
This product is then oxidized through microorganism-catalyzed reactions to nitrate ion:
 NH3 + 2O2 Æ H+ + NO3- + H2O  (16.16)
Under some conditions, an appreciable amount of the nitrogen originating from the degradation

(recall that soil is a generally good cation exchanger), and a small fraction is fi  xed as nonexchange-
able ammonium ion in the crystal lattice of clay minerals. Because nitrate ion is not strongly bound 
to soil, it is readily carried through soil formations by water. Many factors, including soil type, 
moisture, and level of organic matter, affect the production of ammonia and nitrate ion originating 
from feedlot wastes, and a marked variation is found in the levels and distributions of these materi-
als in feedlot areas.
16.5.2 P HOSPHORUS
Although the percentage of phosphorus in plant material is relatively low, it is an essential compo-
nent of plants. Phosphorus, like nitrogen, must be present in a simple inorganic form before it can 
be taken up by plants. In the case of phosphorus, the utilizable species is some form of orthophos-
phate ion. In the pH range that is present in most soils, H2PO4- and HPO42- are the predominant 
orthophosphate species.
Orthophosphate is most available to plants at pH values near neutrality . It is believed that in 
r e l a t i v e l y  a c i d i c  s o i l s ,  o rt h o p h o s p h a t e  i o n s  ar e  p r e c i p i t a t e d  o r  s o r b e d  b y  s p e c i e s  o f  Al ( III )  an d  Soil and Agricultural Environmental Chemistry 433
Fe(III). In alkaline soils, orthophosphate may react with calcium carbonate to form relatively insol-
uble hydroxyapatite:
 3HPO42- + 5CaCO3(s) + 2H2O Æ Ca5(PO4)3(OH)( s) + 5HCO3- + OH-  (16.17)
In general, because of these reactions, little phosphorus applied as fertilizer leaches from the 
soil. This is important from the standpoint of both water pollution and utilization of phosphate 
fertilizers.
16.5.3 P OTASSIUM
Relatively high levels of potassium are utilized by growing plants. Potassium activates some enzymes 
and plays a role in the water balance in plants. It is also essential for some carbohydrate transforma-
tions. Crop yields are generally greatly reduced in potassium-defi  cient soils. The higher the produc-
tivity of the crop, the more the potassium removed from soil. When nitrogen fertilizers are added to 
soils to increase productivity, removal of potassium is enhanced. Therefore, potassium may become 
a limiting nutrient in soils heavily fertilized with other nutrients.
Potassium is one of the most abundant elements in the Earth’s crust, of which it makes up 
2.6%; however, much of this potassium is not easily available to plants. For example, some silicate 
m i n e r a l s  s u c h  a s  l e u c i t e ,  K2O • Al2O3• 4SiO2, contain strongly bound potassium. Exchangeable 
potassium held by clay minerals is relatively more available to plants.
16.6 MICRONUTRIENTS IN SOIL
Boron, chlorine, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum (for N-fi  xation), and zinc are considered 
essential plant micronutrients. These elements are needed by plants only at very low levels and fre-
quently are toxic at higher levels. There is some chance that other elements will be added to this 
list as techniques for growing plants in environments free of specifi  c elements improve. Most of 
these elements function as components of essential enzymes. Manganese, iron, chlorine, and zinc 
may be involved in photosynthesis. It is possible that sodium, silicon, nickel, and cobalt may also be 
essential nutrients for some plants.
Iron and manganese occur in a number of soil minerals. Sodium and chlorine (as chloride) occur 
naturally in soil and are transported as atmospheric particulate matter from marine sprays (see 
Chapter 10). Some of the other micronutrients and trace elements are found in primary (unweath-
ered) minerals that occur in soil. Boron is substituted isomorphically for Si in some micas and is 
present in tourmaline, a mineral with the formula NaMg3Al6B3Si6O27(OH,F)4. Copper is iso-
morphically substituted for other elements in feldspars, amphiboles, olivines, pyroxenes, and micas; 
i t  al s o  o c c u r s  a s  tr a c e  l e v e l s  o f  c o p p e r  s u l fi  des in silicate minerals. Molybdenum occurs as 
molybdenite (MoS2) . V anadi um is isomorphicall y substi tuted f or Fe or Al in o xi des, p yro x enes, 
amphiboles, and micas. Zinc is present as the result of isomorphic substitution for Mg, Fe, and Mn 
in oxides, amphiboles, olivines, and pyroxenes and as trace zinc sulfi  de in silicates. Other trace 
elements that occur as specifi  c minerals, sulfi  de inclusions, or by isomorphic substitution for other 
elements in minerals are chromium, cobalt, arsenic, selenium, nickel, lead, and cadmium.
The trace elements listed above may be coprecipitated with secondary minerals (see Section 15.2) 
that are involved in soil formation. Such secondary minerals include oxides of aluminum, iron, and 
manganese (precipitation of hydrated oxides of iron and manganese very effi  ciently removes many trace 
metal ions from solution); calcium and magnesium carbonates; smectites; vermiculites; and illites.
Micronutrient defi  c i e n c i e s  h a v e  d e v e l o p e d  i n  s o m e  s o i l s .  I n  s o m e  c a s e s ,  d e fi  ciencies are the 
result of soil factors including pH, p E, biological activity, CEC, and soil contents of organic matter 
and clay. Factors involving the plants and their root systems cause variations in micronutrient 
uptake. These include root and root hair morphology and surface area and association of roots with 434 Environmental Chemistry
microorganisms. Also involved are root secretions including H+, OH-, HCO3- ions; citric, oxalic, and 
other acids; and enzymes, such as phosphatases. Major factors involved in micronutrient defi  ciency 
include loss of topsoil, leaching of nutrients from soil, liming of acid soils (Ca2+ from lime competes 
with micronutrient metal ions for root uptake), more intensive cultivation, and intense use of more 
purifi  ed fertilizers.
S o m e  p l an ts  acc um ul a te  e x tr e m e l y  hi gh  l e v e l s  o f  s pec ifi  c trace metals.5 Those accumulating 
more than 1.00 mg/g of dry weight are called hyperaccumulators . Nickel and copper both undergo 
hyperaccumulation in some plant species. As an example of a metal hyperaccumulator, Aeolanthus 
biformifolius DeWild  growing in copper-rich regions of Shaba Province, Zaire, contains up to 1.3% 
copper (dry weight) and is known as a “copper fl  ower.”
The hyperaccumulation of metals by some plants has led to the idea of phytoremediation  in 
which plants growing on contaminated ground accumulate metals, which are then removed with 
the plant biomass. Plants used for phytoremediation should be deep rooted and produce large 
quantities of biomass that has accumulated pollutants. A plant that is promising for its potential to 
perform phytoremediation is Thlaspicaerulescans  (alpine pennycress), a member of the broccoli 
and cabbage family that can grow on soils with high levels of zinc and cadmium and accumulate 
these metals in the plant shoots and leaves. Phytoremediation of uranium-contaminated soils is 
facilitated by adding citrate to the soil to mobilize the uranium in a form that can be taken up by 
plant roots.
16.7 FERTILIZERS
Crop fertilizers contain nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium as major components. Magnesium,

6-12-8, showing the respective percentages of nitrogen expressed as N (in this case 6%), phosphorus 
as P2O5 (12%), and potassium as K2O (8%). Farm manure corresponds to an approximately 0.5-
0.24-0.5 fertilizer. The organic fertilizers such as manure must undergo biodegradation to release 
the simple inorganic species (NO3-, HxPO4x-3, K+) assimilable by plants.
Most modern nitrogen fertilizers are made by the Haber process, in which N2 and H2 are com-
bined over a catalyst at temperatures of approximately 500°C and pressures up to 1000 atm:
 N2 + 3H2 Æ 2NH3  (16.18)
The anhydrous ammonia product has a very high nitrogen content of 82%. It may be added directly 
to the soil, for which it has a strong affi  nity because of its water solubility and formation of ammo-
nium ion:
 NH3(g)(water) Æ NH3(aq),  (16.19)
 NH3(aq) + H2O Æ NH4+ + OH- (16.20)
Special equipment is required, however, because of the toxicity of ammonia gas. Aqua ammonia, 
a 30% solution of NH3 in water, may be used with much greater safety . It is sometimes added 
directly to irrigation water. It should be pointed out that ammonia vapor is toxic and NH3 is reac-
tive with some substances. Improperly discarded or stored ammonia can be a hazardous waste.
Ammonium nitrate, NH4NO3, is a common solid nitrogen fertilizer. It is made by oxidizing ammo-
nia over a platinum catalyst, converting the nitric oxide product to nitric acid and reacting the nitric 
acid with ammonia. The molten ammonium nitrate product is forced through nozzles at the top of a 
prilling tower  and solidifi  es to form small pellets while falling through the tower. The particles are 
coated with a water repellent. Ammonium nitrate contains 33.5% nitrogen. Although convenient to 
apply to soil, it requires considerable care during manufacture and storage because it is explosive. 
Ammonium nitrate also poses some hazards. It is mixed with fuel oil to form an explosive that serves Soil and Agricultural Environmental Chemistry 435
as a substitute for dynamite in quarry blasting and construction. This mixture was used to devastating 
effect in the dastardly bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal Building in 1995.
Urea,
H2NCN H2O
is easier to manufacture and handle than ammonium nitrate. It is now the favored solid nitrogen-
containing fertilizer. The overall reaction for urea synthesis is
 CO2 + 2NH3 Æ CO(NH2)2 + H2O  (16.21)
involving a rather complicated process in which ammonium carbamate, chemical formula 
NH2CO2NH4, is an intermediate.
Other compounds used as nitrogen fertilizers include sodium nitrate (obtained largely from 
Chilean deposits, see Section 15.2), calcium nitrate, potassium nitrate, and ammonium phosphates. 
Ammonium sulfate, a byproduct of coke ovens, used to be widely applied as fertilizer. The alkali 
metal nitrates tend to make soil alkaline whereas ammonium sulfate leaves an acidic residue.
Phosphate minerals are found in several states, including Idaho, Montana, Utah, Wyoming, 
North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Florida. The principal mineral is fl  uorapatite, 
Ca5(PO4)3F. The phosphate from fl  uorapatite is relatively unavailable to plants, and fl  uorapatite is 
frequently treated with phosphoric or sulfuric acids to produce superphosphates:
 2Ca5(PO4)3F(s) + 14H3PO4 + 10H2O Æ 2HF( g) + 10Ca(H2PO4)2• H2O  (16.22)
 2Ca5(PO4)3F(s) + 7H2SO4 + 3H2O Æ 2HF( g) + 3Ca(H2PO4)2• H2O + 7CaSO4 (16.23)
The superphosphate products are much more soluble than the parent phosphate minerals. The HF 
produced as a byproduct of superphosphate production can create air pollution problems.
Phosphate minerals are rich in trace elements required for plant growth, such as boron, copper, 
manganese, molybdenum, and zinc. Ironically, these elements are lost to a large extent when the 
phosphate minerals are processed to make fertilizer. Ammonium phosphates are excellent, highly 
soluble phosphate fertilizers. Liquid ammonium polyphosphate fertilizers consisting of ammonium 
salts of pyrophosphate, triphosphate, and small quantities of higher polymeric phosphate anions in 
aqueous solution work very well as phosphate fertilizers. The polyphosphates are believed to have 
the additional advantage of chelating iron and other micronutrient metal ions, thus making the 
metals more available to plants.
Potassium fertilizer components consist of potassium salts, generally KCl. Such salts are found 
as deposits in the ground or may be obtained from some brines. Very large deposits are found in 
Saskatchewan, Canada. These salts are all quite soluble in water. One problem encountered with 
potassium fertilizers is the luxury uptake of potassium by some crops, which absorb more potassium 
than is really needed for their maximum growth. In a crop where only the grain is harvested, leaving 
the rest of the plant in the fi  eld, luxury uptake does not create much of a problem because most of the 
potassi um is returned to the soil wi th the dead p lant. Ho w e v er , w hen ha y or f orag e is harv ested, 
potassium contained in the plant as a consequence of luxury uptake is lost from the soil.
16.7.1 F ERTILIZER  POLLUTION
One of the more troublesome problems that has arisen from increased fertilizer use in recent times 
is water pollution from agricultural land runoff enriched in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium 
from fertilizers. On a local scale, lakes and reservoirs have become eutrophied as the result of 
fertilizer runoff. The nutrients in fertilizer cause excessive algal growth, the algal biomass decays 436 Environmental Chemistry
and consumes oxygen, and bodies of water are seriously damaged by oxygen depletion. As a non-
point source of pollution, fertilizer runoff presents challenging control problems.
One of the more spectacular manifestations of agricultural fertilizer pollution is the Gulf of 
Mexico dead zone, which develops and grows in size each summer in a region of the Gulf receiving 
Mississippi River runoff. It is attributed to runoff of water enriched in agricultural fertilizers, espe-
cially nitrogen, from the fertile Mississippi river watershed, which enables excessive growth of 
photosynthetic microorganisms (phytoplankton) in the Gulf. The biomass of these organisms along 
with the bodies of zooplankton and their waste products that feed on them settle to the bottom of the 
Gulf where microbial decay results in depletion of DO (hypoxia) that kills fi  sh and other marine 
animal life. Aggravating the effect of low oxygen is the production in anoxic sediments of toxic, 
odorous hydrogen sulfi  de. The formation of this zone is intensifi  ed by the layer of less dense fresh-
water from the Mississippi river that tends to prevent mixing with the seawater that it overlays, 
preventing penetration of oxygen to bottom layers. In 2002 the dead zone of eutrophied, oxygen-
depleted water grew to 8500 square miles, the largest ever recorded. Because of severe fl  ooding in 
agricultural regions of the Mississippi River watershed that washed large amounts of fertilizer resi-
dues into the river, the Gulf dead zone was projected to reach a record area in 2008, but was reduced 
to 8000 square miles by the churning effect of Hurricane Dolly. Efforts have been made to persuade 
agricultural interests to use less fertilizer to reduce the area of the dead zone. More frequent, lighter 
applications of fertilizer should also reduce runoff.
16.8 POLLUTANTS FROM LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION
As it is currently practiced, livestock production generates signifi  cant amounts of environmental 
pollutants. Livestock manure has a very high BOD and can rapidly deplete water of oxygen when it 
gets into waterways. Decomposition of animal waste products produces inorganic nitrogen that can 
contaminate water with potentially toxic nitrate. Inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus released to 
water from the decomposition of livestock wastes can cause eutrophication of water. Nitrous oxide, 
N2O, released to the atmosphere from livestock waste degradation can be an air pollutant. Methane 
generated in the anaerobic degradation of livestock wastes is a potent greenhouse gas.
Several organoarsenic compounds, especially roxarsone, 
HO–As–O
OH– OH 
NO2 Roxarsone (3-nitro-4-hydroxy-phenylarsonic acid)
have been added to poultry feed to control disease (coccidiosis), enhance the effi  ciency of feed 
utilization, stimulate growth and egg production, and improve meat appearance. Roxarsone and 
its degradation products have been found in chicken litter and arsenic has been detected in soils 
fertilized with chicken litter. Although roxarsone has a relatively low toxicity, its inorganic biodeg-
radation products are rather toxic. By 2008 arsenic compounds in chicken feed had been reduced 
signifi  cantly and some major producers had discontinued these additives.
16.9 PESTICIDES AND THEIR RESIDUES IN SOIL
The following are four major concerns regarding pesticides in soil that need to be considered with 
respect to their licensing and regulation:
Carryover of pesticides and biologically active degradation products to crops grown in • 
later seasons
Biological effects on organisms in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems including bioaccu-• 
mulation and transfer through food chainsSoil and Agricultural Environmental Chemistry 437
Groundwater contamination• 
Effects on soil fertility• 
Herbicides are the most common chemicals that infl  uence soil and the organisms that it supports 
because to be effective they must generally come into direct contact with soil and persist long 
enough to be effective.
An important environmental characteristic of chemicals such as herbicides in soil is the for-
mation of bound residues , which are parent compounds or metabolites in soil or in the organisms 
that inhabit soil and that are not extractable by common extraction procedures.6 A common way 
of studying bound residues consists of spiking soil with compounds labeled with radioactive 
carbon-14 and subjecting the spiked soil to extraction. It is possible to measure the radiolabeled 
carbon in the extracts, in carbon dioxide respiration product, and in the soil residue. However, this 
kind of procedure does not necessarily refl  ect the bioavailability of a substance in soil and its related 
characteristics of biodegradation, bioaccumulation, or mineralization. 
It is well established that as pesticides and other foreign compounds remain in soil for longer 
periods of time the following occur: 
The substances become increasingly resistant to extraction and desorption processes• 
They become signifi  cantly less bioavailable to organisms • 
Overall toxicity is decreased• 
These bioavailability and extractability effects are usually attributed to interaction of the con-
taminant compound with soil organic matter and are more pronounced for soils with high organic 
matter content. Molecules become trapped within micropores of the organic matter and are thus 
rendered less environmentally reactive. The apparent increase in binding with time may be due to 
slow migration of the molecules into more remote and smaller micropores and perhaps formation of 
covalent bonds to organic matter.
The bioavailability of foreign compounds in soil has traditionally been estimated by extraction of 
the materials from soil by various solvent compositions. However, it is generally believed that this 
overstates the environmental and biological availability of bound residues. As alternatives, tests involv-
ing microbial mineralization and uptake by earthworms using compounds radiolabeled with carbon-14 
to follow the fate of residues have been used. The extent to which soil bacteria convert bound residues 
to in or g ani c carbo n is a reas o nab l y g ood meas ure o f b i o a v ail ab ili ty . U ptak e o f bo un d res i d u es b y 
earthworms provides evidence of bioavailability to multicelled organisms capable of ingesting soil.
16.9.1 S OIL FUMIGANTS
Soil fumigants are volatile substances applied to soil to combat bacteria, fungi, nematodes, arthro-
pods, and weeds, primarily on fi  elds used to grow potatoes, tomatoes, strawberries carrots, and pep-
pers. Because of fumigants’ use on food crops and the potential for exposure of workers who tend and 
harvest these crops, the safety of these substances has been a matter of considerable concern. Structural 
formulas of the most common soil fumigants are shown in Figure 16.6. The most widely accepted soil 
fumigant has been methyl bromide, H3CBr, but it was phased out of use in most industrialized countries 
including the United States in 2005 except for some very limited “critical use exemptions.” Metam 
sodium is the most widely applied fumigant and the third most widely used pesticide in the United 
States, primarily on potato fi  elds. In soil it breaks down to methyl isothiocyanate, which is the active 
agent (shown in Figure 16.6). In 2007 the U.S. EPA approved limited use of methyl iodide, H3CI. 
Dimethyl disulfi  de is a relatively new fumigant that is commonly applied along with chloropicrin. 
Although it has been assumed that because of their volatility soil fumigants do not persist in soil 
or cause groundwater pollution problems, studies with carbon-14 labeled fumigants has shown 
bound residues of these substances in soil. The levels of these residues in soil are strongly correlated 
with organic matter in the soil and they are apparently bound with fulvic acid ( see discussion of 438 Environmental Chemistry
humic substances in Section 3.17) in soil.7 Soil fumigants are believed to act as toxicants to pests in 
soil by alkylating biological macromolecules including DNA and proteins. It has been suggested 
that the bound residues of soil fumigants form in soil as the result of alkylation of fulvic acid mole-
cules, thus effectively removing and detoxifying the fumigants.
16.10 WASTES AND POLLUTANTS IN SOIL
Soil receives large quantities of waste products. Much of the sulfur dioxide emitted in the burning 
of sulfur-containing fuels ends up as soil sulfate. Atmospheric nitrogen oxides are converted to 
nitrates in the atmosphere, and the nitrates eventually are deposited on soil. Soil sorbs NO and NO2, 
and these gases are oxidized to nitrate in the soil. Carbon monoxide is converted to CO2 and pos-
sibly to biomass by soil bacteria and fungi. Particulate lead from automobile exhausts is found at 
elevated levels in soil along heavily traveled highways. Elevated levels of lead from lead mines and 
smelters are found on soil near such facilities.
Soil is the receptor of many hazardous wastes from landfi  ll leachate, lagoons, and other sources 
(see Chapter 20). In some cases, land farming of degradable hazardous organic wastes is practiced 
as a means of disposal and degradation. The degradable material is worked into the soil, and soil 
microbial processes bring about its degradation. As discussed in Chapter 8, sewage and fertilizer-
rich sewage sludge may be applied to soil.
The various constituents of soil have different affi  nities for organic contaminants. Natural organic 
matter, primarily humic substances, have a relatively high affi  nity for organic contaminants and 
heavy metal ions. Many soils contain elemental carbon, black carbon , material in the ash left over 
from the burning of crop residues, including sugarcane trash, wheat straw, and rice straw. This 
material is probably an important repository of organic contaminants in soil.
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as benzene, toluene, xylenes, dichloromethane, trichlo-
roethane, and trichloroethylene, may contaminate soil in industrialized and commercialized areas, 
particularly in countries in which enforcement of regulations is not very stringent. One of the more 
common sources of these contaminants is leaking underground storage tanks. Landfi  lls built before 
current stringent regulations were enforced and improperly discarded solvents are also signifi  cant 
sources of soil VOCs.
Measurements of levels of PCBs in soils that have been archived for several decades provide 
interesting insight into the contamination of soil by pollutant chemicals and subsequent loss of these 
substances from soil.8 Analyses of soils from the United Kingdom dating from the early 1940s to 
1992 showed that the PCB levels increased sharply from the 1940s, reaching peak levels around 
1970. Subsequently, levels fell sharply and now are back to early 1940s concentrations. This fall was 
accompanied by a shift in distribution to the more highly chlorinated PCBs, which was attributed 
by those doing the study to volatilization and long-range transport of the lighter PCBs away from 
the soil. These trends parallel levels of PCB manufacture and use in the United Kingdom from the 
early 1940s to the present. This is consistent with the observation that relatively high concentrations H

of PCBs have been observed in remote Arctic and sub-Arctic regions, attributed to condensation in 
colder climates of PCBs volatilized in warmer regions. 
Some pollutant organic compounds are believed to become bound with humus during the humi-
fi cation process that occurs in soil. This largely immobilizes and detoxifi  es the compounds. Binding 
of pollutant compounds by humus is particularly likely to occur with compounds that have struc-
tural similarities to humic substances, such as phenolic and anilinic compounds illustrated by the 
following two examples:
Cl ClOH
ClNH2
2,4-Dichlorophenol 4-Chloroaniline 
Such compounds can become covalently bonded to humic substance molecules as bound residues.

crops. The degradation and eventual fate of these pesticides on soil largely determines their ultimate 
environmental effects. Detailed knowledge of these effects are now required for licensing of a new 
pesticide (in the United States under the FIFRA). Among the factors to be considered are the sorp-
tion of the pesticide by soil; leaching of the pesticide into water, as related to its potential for water 
pollution; effects of the pesticide on microorganisms and animal life in the soil; and possible pro-
duction of relatively more toxic degradation products.
Adsorption by soil is a key aspect of pesticide degradation and plays a strong role in the speed 
and degree of degradation. The degree of adsorption and the speed and extent of ultimate degrada-
tion are infl  uenced by a number of other factors. Some of these, including solubility, volatility, 
charge, polarity, and molecular structure and size, are properties of the medium. Adsorption of a 
pesticide by soil components may have several effects. Under some circumstances, it retards degra-
dation by separating the pesticide from the microbial enzymes that degrade it, whereas under other 
circumstances the reverse is true. Purely chemical degradation reactions may be catalyzed by 
adsorption. Loss of the pesticide by volatilization or leaching is diminished. The toxicity of a herbi-
cide to plants may be reduced by sorption on soil. The forces holding a pesticide to soil particles 
may be of several types. Physical adsorption involves van der Waals forces arising from dipole−dipole 
interactions between the pesticide molecule and charged soil particles. Ion exchange is especially 
effective in holding cationic organic compounds, such as the herbicide paraquat, 
N+ +N CH3 • 2Cl–H3C
to anionic soil particles. Some neutral pesticides become cationic by protonation and are bound as the 
protonated positive form. Hydrogen bonding is another mechanism by which some pesticides are held 
to soil. In some cases, a pesticide may act as a ligand coordinating with metals in soil mineral matter.
The three primary ways in which pesticides are degraded in or on soil are chemical degradation , 
photochemical reactions , and, most important, biodegradation . Various combinations of these 
processes may operate in the degradation of a pesticide. 
Chemical degradation  of pesticides has been observed experimentally in soils and clays steril-
ized to remove all microbial activity. A number of purely chemical hydrolytic reactions of pesticides 
occur in soil. For example, clays have been shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of o,o-dimethyl- o-
2,4,5-trichlorophenyl thiophosphate (also called trolene, ronnel, etrolene, or trichlorometafos), an 
effect attributed to –OH groups on the mineral surface:

A number of pesticides have been shown to undergo photochemical reactions , that is, chemical 
reactions brought about by the absorption of light (see Chapter 9). Frequently, isomers of the pesti-
cides are formed as products. Many of the studies reported apply to pesticides in water or on thin 
fi lms, and relatively less is known about the photochemical reactions of pesticides on soil and plant 
surfaces.
16.10.1 B IODEGRADATION  AND THE RHIZOSPHERE
Although insects, earthworms, and plants may play roles in the biodegradation  of pesticides and 
other pollutant organic chemicals, microorganisms have the most important role. Several examples 
of microorganism-mediated degradation of organic chemical species are given in Chapter 6.
The rhizosphere , the layer of soil in which plant roots are especially active, is a particularly 
important part of soil with respect to biodegradation of wastes. It is a zone of increased biomass 
and is strongly infl  uenced by the plant root system and the microorganisms associated with plant 
roots. The rhizosphere may have more than 10 times the microbial biomass per unit volume com-
pared to nonrhizospheric zones of soil. This population varies with soil characteristics, plant and 
root characteristics, moisture content, and exposure to oxygen. If this zone is exposed to pollutant 
compounds, microorganisms adapted to their biodegradation may also be present. 
Plants and microorganisms exhibit a strong synergistic relationship in the rhizosphere, which 
benefi  ts the plant and enables highly elevated populations of rhizospheric microorganisms to exist. 
Epidermal cells sloughed from the root as it grows and carbohydrates, amino acids, and root-growth-
lubricant mucigel secreted from the roots all provide nutrients for microorganism growth. Root 
hairs provide a hospitable biological surface for colonization by microorganisms. 
The biodegradation of a number of synthetic organic compounds has been demonstrated in the 
rhizosphere. Understandably, studies in this area have focused on herbicides and insecticides that 
are widely used on crops. Among the organic species for which enhanced biodegradation in the 
rhizosphere has been demonstrated are 2,4-d herbicide, parathion, carbofuran, atrazine, diazinon, 
volatile aromatic alkyl and aryl hydrocarbons, chlorocarbons, and surfactants.
16.11 SOIL LOSS AND DEGRADATION
Soil is a fragile resource that can be lost by erosion or become so degraded that it is no longer useful 
to support crops. Soil degradation is discussed here and measures to prevent and reverse it in 
Section 16.12.
The physical properties of soil and, hence, its susceptibility to erosion, are strongly affected by 
the cultivation practices to which the soil is subjected. Desertifi  cation  refers to the process asso-
ciated with drought and loss of fertility by which soil becomes unable to grow signifi  cant amounts 
of plant life. Desertifi  cation caused by human activities is a common problem globally, occurring in 
diverse locations such as Argentina, the Sahara, Uzbekistan, the U.S. Southwest, Syria, and Mali. It 
is a very old problem dating back many centuries to the introduction of domesticated grazing 
animals to areas where rainfall and groundcover were marginal. The most notable example is deser-
tifi cation aggravated by domesticated goats in the Sahara region. Desertifi  cation involves a number 
of interrelated factors, including erosion, climate variations, water availability, loss of fertility, loss 
of soil humus, and deterioration of soil chemical properties. 
A related problem is deforestation , loss of forests. The problem is particularly acute in tropical 
regions, where the forests contain most of the existing plant and animal species. In addition to 
extinction of these species, deforestation can cause devastating deterioration of soil through erosion 
and loss of nutrients. 
Soil erosion  is the loss of soil by the action of both water and wind; water is the primary source 
of erosion. Millions of tons of topsoil are carried by the Mississippi River and swept from its mouth Soil and Agricultural Environmental Chemistry 441
each year. About one-third of the U.S. topsoil has been lost since cultivation began in the continent. 
Figure 16.7 shows the pattern of soil erosion in the continental United States in 1977.
Wind erosion, such as occurs on the generally dry, high plains soils of eastern Colorado, poses 
another threat. After the Dust Bowl days of the 1930s, much of this land was allowed to revert to 
grassland, and the topsoil was held in place by the strong root systems of the grass cover. However, 
in an effort to grow more wheat and improve the sale value of the land, much of it was later 
returned to cultivation. Although freshly cultivated grassland may yield well for one or two years, 
the nutrients and soil moisture are rapidly exhausted and the land becomes very susceptible to 
wind erosion.
16.11.1 S OIL SUSTAINABILITY  AND WATER RESOURCES
The conservation of soil and the protection of water resources are strongly interrelated. Most fresh-
water falls initially on soil, and the condition of the soil largely determines the fate of the water and 
how much is retained in a usable condition. The land area upon which rainwater falls is called a 
watershed . In addition to collecting the water, the watershed determines the direction and rate of 
fl ow and the degree of water infi  ltration into groundwater aquifers (see the hydrologic cycle in 
Figure 3.1). Excessive rates of water fl  ow prevent infi  ltration, lead to fl  ash fl  oods, and cause soil ero-
sion. Measures taken to enhance the utility of land as a watershed also fortunately help prevent 
erosion. Some of these measures, which are discussed in Section 16.12, involve modifi  cation of the 
contour of the soil, particularly terracing, construction of waterways, and construction of water- 
retaining ponds. Waterways are planted with grass to prevent erosion, and water-retaining crops 
and bands of trees can be planted on the contour to achieve much the same goal. Reforestation and 
control of damaging grazing practices conserve both soil and water.
Covering soil with impermeable paving can prevent water infi  ltration to groundwater and increase 
the extent and rate of runoff. To help alleviate that problem Chicago has started an innovative 
“Green Alley” program in which alleys are paved with a porous concrete that allows water  infi  ltration 
and eventual percolation into groundwater. This helps maintain groundwater levels and serves to 
FIGURE 16.7 Pattern of soil erosion in the continental United States as of 1977. The dark areas indicate 
locations where the greatest erosion is occurring.442 Environmental Chemistry
reduce the burden on the stormwater collection system. Microorganisms that become embedded in 
the porous concrete serve to degrade organic matter including petroleum products that are carried 
by the infi  ltrating water.
16.12 SAVING THE LAND
With food as the most basic need that humans have, the sustainability of means to produce food is 
a top priority. The most basic part of food sustainability is the preservation of soil and its ability to 
support plant life, especially in the protection of soil from erosion. The preservation of soil from 
erosion is commonly termed soil conservation . There are a number of solutions to the soil erosion 
p r o b l e m .  S o m e  a r e  o l d ,  w e l l - k n o w n  a g r i c u l t u r a l  p r a c t i c e s ,  s u c h  a s  t e r r a c i n g ,  c o n t o u r  p l o w i n g  
(Figure 16.8), and periodically planting fi  elds with cover crops, such as clover. For some crops con-
servation tillage (no-till agriculture) greatly reduces erosion. This practice consists of planting a 
crop among the residue of the previous year’s crop, without plowing. Weeds are killed in the newly 
planted crop row by application of a herbicide prior to planting. The surface residue of plant material 
left on top of the soil prevents erosion.
Operators of at least one vinyard in the Napa Valley of California plant clover, oats, peas, and 
mustard as winter cover between the rows of vines. The clover and peas are legumes that fi  x atmo-
spheric nitrogen and add to soil fertility. The crops are cut at the beginning of the summer growing 
season and the residues left on the soil to prevent weed growth, reduce erosion, and add fertility. 
One interesting aspect of the system is that perches are provided in the vinyards to attract hawks and 
owls that prey on rodents that live in the cut plant residues.
Another, more experimental, solution to the soil erosion problem is the cultivation of perennial 
plants, which develop large root systems and come up each spring after being harvested the previ-
ous fall. For example, a perennial corn plant has been developed by crossing corn with a distant, 
wild relative, teosinte, which grows in Central America. Unfortunately, the resulting plant does 
not give outstanding grain yields. It should be noted that an annual plant’s ability to propagate 
depends upon producing large quantities of seeds, which is why plants harvested for their grain 
(seeds) are annual plants. In contrast, a perennial plant must develop a strong root system with 
bulbous growths called rhizomes, which store food for the coming year. However, it is possible 
that the application of genetic engineering may result in the development of perennial crops with 
good seed yields. The cultivation of such a crop would signifi  cantly reduce soil erosion.
TerracesContour planting
and cultivation
FIGURE 16.8 Construction of terraces on the contour of land and planting cops on the contour are practices 
that have been very effective in reducing soil erosion.Soil and Agricultural Environmental Chemistry 443
16.12.1 A GROFORESTRY
The best known perennial plants are trees, which are very effective in stopping soil erosion. Wood 
from trees can be used as fuel, as raw material, for construction, and as food (glucose from wood 
cellulose, see below). There is a tremendous unrealized potential for an increase in the production 
of tree biomass. In the past, trees were often allowed to grow naturally with native varieties and 
without the benefi  t of any special agricultural practices, such as fertilization. The productivity of 
biomass from trees can be greatly increased with improved varieties, including those that are genet-
ically engineered, and with improved cultivation and fertilization.
A promising alternative in sustainable agriculture is agroforestry  in which crops are grown in 
strips between rows of trees as shown in Figure 16.9. The trees stabilize the soil, particularly on 
sloping terrain. By choosing trees with the capability to fi  x nitrogen, the system can be self- suffi  cient 
in this essential nutrient.
Cultivation called alley cropping across the slope  (Figure 16.9) uses fast-growing, nitrogen- 
fi xing trees to hold sloping soil in place. Spreading nutrient-rich tree prunings on the soil where 
crops are grown between crop seasons fertilizes the soil, adding organic matter and holding the soil 
in place. The trees potentially have economic value in providing wood for construction, fi  rewood for 
cooking, fruit, and nuts. Genetically engineered trees may even provide high-value pharmaceuticals 
and specialty chemicals in the future. At the bottom of the slope, a buffer strip of grass can serve to 
fi lter nutrients and suspended soil from runoff from the fi  elds. Potentially, rich topsoil collected by 
the buffer strip can be returned to higher levels to enrich the soil.
The most important use for wood is, of course, as lumber for construction. This use will remain 
important as higher energy costs increase the costs of other construction materials, such as steel, 
aluminum, and cement. Wood is about 50% cellulose, which can be hydrolyzed by enzyme pro-
cesses to yield glucose sugar. The glucose can be used directly as food, fermented to ethyl alcohol 
for fuel (gasohol), or employed as a carbon and energy source for protein-producing yeasts. Given 
these and other potential uses, the future of trees as an environmentally desirable and profi  table crop 
is very promising.
16.12.2 S OIL RESTORATION
Soil can be impaired by loss of fertility, erosion, buildup of salinity, contamination by phytotoxins, 
such as zinc from sewage sludge, and other insults. Soil has a degree of resilience and can largely 
recover whenever the conditions leading to its degradation are removed. However, in many cases, 
more active measures called soil restoration  are required to restore soil productivity, through the 
application of restoration ecology. Measures taken in soil restoration may include physical alteration 
of the soil to provide terraces and relatively fl  at areas not subject to erosion. Organic matter can be

restored by planting crops the residues of which are cultivated into the soil for partially decayed 
biomass. Nutrients may be added and contaminants neutralized. Excess acid or base can be neutral-
ized and salinity can be leached from the soil. Some toxic substances can be removed by plants in 
the process of phytoremediation (see Section 16.6). As the demand for food increases and damage 
to soil becomes more evident, soil restoration will become a very important endeavor.
16.13 GENETIC ENGINEERING AND AGRICULTURE
The nuclei of living cells contain the genetic instruction for cell reproduction. These instructions are 
in the form of a special material called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). In combination with proteins, 
DNA makes up the cell chromosomes. During the 1970s, the ability to manipulate DNA through 
genetic engineering became a reality, and since then it has become the basis of a major industry. 
Such manipulation falls into the category of recombinant DNA technology. Recombinant DNA gets 
its name from the fact that it contains DNA from two different organisms, recombined together. 
This technology promises some exciting developments in agriculture and, indeed, is expected to 
lead to a “second green revolution.”
The fi  rst “green revolution” of the mid-1960s used conventional plant-breeding techniques of 
selective breeding, hybridization, cross-pollination, and back-crossing, to develop new strains of 
rice, wheat, and corn, which, when combined with chemical fertilizers, yielded spectacularly 
increased crop yields. For example, India’s output of grain increased 50%. By working at the cel-
lular level, however, it is now possible to greatly accelerate the process of plant breeding. Thus, 
plants may be developed that resist particular diseases, grow in seawater, or have much higher pro-
ductivity. The possibility exists for developing entirely new kinds of plants.
One exciting possibility with genetic engineering is the development of plants other than legumes 
that fi  x their own nitrogen. For example, if nitrogen-fi  xing corn could be developed, the savings in 
fertilizer would be enormous. Furthermore, since the nitrogen is fi  xed in an organic form in plant 
root structures, there would be no pollutant runoff of chemical fertilizers.
Another promising possibility with genetic engineering is increased effi  ciency of photosynthesis. 
Plants utilize only about 1% of the sunlight striking their leaves, so there is appreciable room for 
improvement in that area.
Cell-culture techniques can be applied in which billions of cells are allowed to grow in a medium 
and develop mutants which, for example, might be resistant to particular viruses or herbicides or 
have other desirable qualities. If the cells with the desired qualities can be regenerated into whole 
plants, results can be obtained that might have taken decades using conventional plant-breeding 
techniques.
The United States has by far the largest land area devoted to genetically modifi  ed crops, 143 mil-
lion acres of corn, soybean, cotton, canola, squash, papaya, and alfalfa in 2008. Ranking next were 
Argentina (47 million acres), Brazil (37 million acres), Canada (17 million acres), and India (15 mil-
lion acres). China ranked sixth with 9 million acres of genetically modifi  ed crops but was planning 
a big increase in such crops in an effort to feed its huge population.
There has been strong resistance to transgenic crops and livestock in some quarters. This is espe-
cially true in Europe where restrictions on genetically modifi  ed foods and strict labeling require-
ments are in force. A particular concern with GM crops in Europe is the possibility of gene transfer 
to non-GM varieties such as might occur with cross-pollination of GM corn to other varieties of 
corn by means of corn pollen. Genes from GM crops could be transferred to wild plants that might 
act as particularly aggressive weeds.
Despite the enormous potential of the “green revolution,” genetic engineering, and more inten-
sive cultivation of land to produce food and fi  ber, these technologies cannot be relied upon to sup-
port an uncontrolled increase in world population, and may even simply postpone an inevitable day 
of reckoning with the consequences of population growth. Changes in climate resulting from global 
warming (greenhouse effect, Section 14.2), ozone depletion (by CFCs, Section 14.6), or natural Soil and Agricultural Environmental Chemistry 445
disasters such as massive volcanic eruptions or collisions with large meteorites can, and almost 
certainly will, result in worldwide famine conditions in the future that no agricultural technology 
will be able to alleviate.
16.14 GREEN CHEMISTRY AND SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
The practice of green chemistry may signifi  cantly enhance agricultural productivity and sustain-
ability. To understand why this is so, it is useful to consider some of the problems that have arisen 
from spectacular advances in agricultural productivity with the application of advanced technolo-
gies over the last 100 years:
Pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers and their products have accumulated on agricultural • 
lands and waters leading to adverse effects on wildlife, the environment, and potentially 
humans as well.
Nontarget organisms have suffered and insect and weed pests have built up resistance to • 
agents used in their eradication.
Poorly trained and inadequately protected personnel in less developed countries have • 
 suffered adverse effects from modern agricultural products.
Disposal problems have arisen with respect to obsolete pesticides.• 
The application of green chemistry to agriculture holds promise for preventing or alleviating prob-
lems such as these.
Agriculture is a science of living organisms applied to human needs for food and fi  ber produc-
tion. So in attempting to fi  nd more sustainable and environment-friendly approaches to agriculture, 
it is reasonable to look to natural ecosystems that have evolved over the eons that enable various 
species of plants and animals to thrive. Such an approach is based upon biomimetics  in which 
humans attempt to mimic natural life systems.
Pesticides that come from natural sources such as plants or bacteria are called biopesticides . 
These substances are usually more environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides, although the 
blanket assumption that anything from a natural source is automatically safer than synthetic materi-
als should not be made. Some substances, such as botulinum from botulinus  bacteria or ricin from 
castor beans are among the most toxic substances known. In cases where genetic material is intro-
duced into plants, there is the possibility that the material may get into wild species, such as weeds, 
with unintended consequences. There is also concern that proteins in biopesticides may be aller-
gens. The three major categories of biopesticides are
Microbial pesticides composed of microorganisms, such as insecticide-producing cells of • 
Bacillus thuringiensis  bacteria
Plant-incorporated protectants, such as plants genetically engineered to make the insecti-• 
cide produced by Bacillus thuringiensis
Biochemical pesticides that control pests by nontoxic effects, such as sex attractants that • 
confuse insects’ reproductive activities
Advantages of biopesticides include a generally lower toxicity than conventional pesticides, high 
specifi  city for target pests, effectiveness in very small quantities, and rapid decomposition. 
Biopesticides are generally most effective when used in a program of integrated pest management.
A promising biomimetic approach is the use of naturally produced pesticides and pheromones in 
combating pests. Pheromones are substances produced by organisms, especially insects, in small 
quantities that are used for communication, especially with respect to reproduction. Because of their 
low toxicities, specifi  cities for kinds of insects, and minute quantities required, pheromones are very 
environmentally friendly. Some insects can detect a single molecule of pheromone.446 Environmental Chemistry
Some pheromones are relatively simple compounds. One example is methylsalicylate, which is 
released by some plants infested with insects such as aphids. This compound is an antiaphrodisiac 
released by male aphids during mating to make the females unattractive to other males, and release 
of this substance in the vicinity of aphid-infested crops interferes with aphid reproduction.
Another approach using pheromones is to place these materials in traps containing insecticides. 
The quantities of pheromones required are minute, as little as 50 mg per trap. For example, the 
diamondback moth, a cabbage pest, can be controlled with traps baited with its pheromone and 
containing permethrin insecticide.
Pheromone-based pest control has been found to be especially effective in control of moths, 
which are pests for a signifi  cant number of crops. One such pest is the gypsy moth, which is a seri-
ous problem for forest trees. Another is the coddling moth, which is the most serious pest in 
Washington State apple orchards.
One of the greatest deterrent to the widespread use of pheromones for insect control is cost. 
Recombinant DNA technologies are now being used to enable microorganisms such as yeasts to 
produce pheromones, and these technologies may signifi  cantly reduce costs of pheromones for pest 
control.
Efforts are under way to fi  nd natural products with insecticidal properties. The greatest success 
to date with natural products insecticides has been with the proteinaceous materials produced by 
strains of Bacillus thuringiensis  (Bt). Consisting of a family of proteins that are selective for various 
insect pests, Bt destroys insect larvae by causing their digestive tracts to deteriorate, but it is not 
appreciably toxic to noninsect organisms and it breaks down in the environment. The genes for 
producing Bt have been spliced into corn and other crops by recombinant DNA techniques, and 
large fractions of the corn and cotton crops now grown in the United States and some other coun-
tries consist of these genetically modifi  ed strains.
Another pesticide from natural sources is Dow Agrosciences’ Spinosad produced by the bacte-
rium Saccaropolyspora spinosa . This substance is a neurotoxin to insect pests that affl  ict a number 
of economic pests including those that attack fruit, vegetables, trees, and cotton. Spinosad is non-
volatile, does not bioaccumulate, and has a low toxicity to mammals. Rohm and Haas have devel-
oped CONFIRM, a dicylhydrazine that mimics ecdysone, a hormone that initiates molting in 
insects. CONFIRM causes caterpillars to quit eating so that they die of dehydration and starvation. 
Another insecticide that operates by the same mechanism is azadirachtin, which is extracted from 
the kernels of the neem tree.
Development of a biofungicide from natural sources, AgraQuest’s Serenade, was one of the win-
ners of the 2003 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Awards. Serenade is a mixture of more 
than 30 lipopeptides such as agrastatin A (Figure 1 6. 1 0) produced by a bacterium isolated from a 
California orchard and designated Bacillus subtilis , strain QST - 7 1 3 . Advantages of this fungicide 
include negligible toxicity to nontarget organisms and ready biodegradability. The active ingredients 
of the substance can be made by fermentation of natural materials, an inherently “green” process.

Dow Agrosciences won the 2008 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award for the 
development of Spinetoram, a chemical modifi  cation of spinosyns, which are oxic fermentation 
p r o d u c t s  o f  t h e  s o i l  b a c t e r i u m ,  Saccharopolyspora spinosa . Winner of the 1999 Presidential 
Green Chemistry Award, Spinosad, described above, is a combination of spinosyns A and D, that 
is a very effective, safe, and environmentally benign insecticide for vegetables, but not very effec-
tive for insect control on tree fruits and tree nuts. Using relatively minor modifi  cations of existing 
spinosyns, the developers of Spinetoram devised a material that retains the favorable environ-
mental properties of Spinosad and is effective for the control of insect pests on fruit and nut trees. 
The mammalian acute oral toxicity of Spinetoram is only about 1/1000 that of azinphos-methyl 
and 1/44 that of phosmet, the two organophosphate insecticides that it is designed to replace. 
Weeds are another major class of agricultural pest. Numerous herbicides have been developed to 
kill weeds. Probably one of the safest of these—and certainly one of the most widely used—is 
Monsanto’s Roundup, glyophosate discussed in Section 16.1. A problem with Roundup and many 
other herbicides is that they may kill crops that they are used to protect. Soybeans, cotton, corn, and 
other crops have now been genetically engineered that are not harmed by Roundup, allowing its 
direct application to these crops to kill competing weeds, thus signifi  cantly reducing the amount of 
herbicide required.
Plants are susceptible to a variety of fungal, bacterial, and viral diseases. An interesting approach 
to combating such diseases is by activating plants’ natural defense mechanisms. This has been done 
successfully with harpin, a protein produced by Erwinia amylovora , the bacterial agent of fi  re blight 
in apples and pears. E. coli  bacteria have been genetically modifi  ed to produce harpin, which is sold 
as Eden Bioscience’s Messenger biochemical pesticide and is reputed to enable plants to resist dis-
ease and generally thrive better. 
Green chemistry can be applied to fertilizer utilization. A problem with urea, a favored fertilizer 
source of nutrient nitrogen is that it undergoes biologically mediated hydrolysis,
 CO(NH2)2 + H2O Æ CO + 2NH3  (16.25)
leading to loss of as much as 30% of its nitrogen from evaporation of ammonia. Applied in relatively 
small quantities, N-(n-butyl)thiophosphorictriamide, a urease enzyme inhibitor, reduces the micro-
bial hydrolysis of urea and increases the effi  ciency of urea fertilizer utilization. Thermal polyaspar-
tate, a polyelectrolyte material formed by condensation and base treatment of the naturally occurring 
amino acid aspartic acid,
HO C C C CO H
NH
HHOHHO
Aspartic acid
and containing an abundance of carboxylate groups ( -CO 2-) groups has been found to be effective 
in stimulating plant uptake of fertilizer, thus reducing the amount of fertilizer required. This mate-
rial has the advantage of coming from biological sources and being biodegradable.
16.15 AGRICULTURE AND HEALTH
Soil, the plants that grow on it, and the animals that consume these plants constitute an important 
connection between the geosphere and the biosphere and may infl  uence health. An important con-
nection is the incorporation into food of micronutrient elements essential for human health. One 
such nutrient (which is toxic at overdose levels) is selenium. It is defi  nitely known that the health of 
animals is adversely affected in selenium-defi  cient areas as it is in areas of selenium excess. Human 
health might be similarly affected.448 Environmental Chemistry
There are some striking geographic correlations with the occurrence of cancer, some of which 
may be due to soil type and its infl  uence on food. A high incidence of stomach cancer occurs in 
areas with certain types of soils in the Netherlands, the United States, France, Wales, and Scandinavia. 
These soils are high in organic matter content, are acidic, and are frequently waterlogged.
One possible reason for the existence of “stomach cancer-producing soils” is the production of 
cancer-causing secondary metabolites by plants and microorganisms. Secondary metabolites are 
biochemical compounds that are of no apparent use to the organism producing them. It is believed 
that they are formed from the precursors of primary metabolites when the primary metabolites 
accumulate to excessive levels.
The role of soil in environmental health is not defi  nitively known, and has not been as extensively 
studied as it deserves. The amount of research on the infl  uence of soil in producing foods that are 
more nutritious and lower in content of naturally occurring toxic substances is quite small compared 
to research on higher soil productivity. It is hope d that the environmental health aspects of soil and 
its products will receive much greater emphasis in the future.
16.15.1 F OOD CONTAMINATION
Food is subject to contamination from faulty agricultural practices. The most common type of con-
tamination is microbiological, often from bacteria transferred to food from human or animal wastes 
sources. In 2006, numerous cases including several fatalities due to hemolytic uremic syndrome 
were reported in the United States attributed to bagged spinach contaminated with E. coli  O157:H7 
bacteria. In 2008, the U.S. fresh tomato industry was devastated by erroneous reports of Salmonella  
contamination eventually attributed to peppers imported from Mexico. Some sources of peppers 
from Mexico as well as irrigation water used on the pepper crops were found to be contaminated 
with Salmonella .
The most common source of chemical contamination of food is from application of pesticides. 
Although large quantities of herbicides and soil fumigants are commonly applied to soil, insecti-
cides are more likely to be found in food because to be effective they must usually be applied to 
plants. Sewage sludge applied to soil is a potential source of chemical contamination, particularly 
from phytotoxic zinc and heavy metals.
16.16 PROTECTING THE FOOD SUPPLY FROM ATTACK
As the basic provider of food that all humans need for their existence, the agricultural system is 
clearly of utmost importance and requires maximum protection from attack. In modern industrial-
ized countries such as the United States, agriculture is highly specialized and now lacks the diver-
sity which would otherwise protect it from, for example, infestation with pathogens to which widely 
grown varieties of crops are susceptible. Past disease outbreaks, such as the hoof and mouth disease 
infestation of livestock in England in 2001, serve as reminders of the vulnerability of the agricul-
tural sector. Even a single incident, such as the fi  nding of a cow with mad cow disease in Washington 
state in December 2003, can cause great anxiety and have signifi  cant economic repercussions. 
Although chemical attack on agricultural systems is plausible, it is hard to imagine such an attack 
on a scale that would cause great damage. It is possible that crops could be sprayed with toxic 
chemicals before harvest, and, if these materials got into the food supply, could cause some anxiety 
and economic disruption. However, it would be diffi  cult to mount such an attack in secrecy and on 
a scale required to do signifi  cant harm. 
Infestation by crop-destroying insects could cause enormous loss and has done so throughout 
history. Huge swarms of locusts that devored all plant material in their paths are described in the 
Bible and still devastate agricultural areas. The boll weevil nearly wiped out the U.S. cotton crop 
during 1800s. Some of the most damaging insect infestations have come from exotic insect species Soil and Agricultural Environmental Chemistry 449
introduced to areas where they previously were not found such as has been the case with beetle spe-
cies that have killed millions of trees in U.S. forests. 
Microbial diseases pose a signifi  cant threat to agriculture and could be used as attacking agents. 
Insofar as plants are concerned, the greatest microbial threats are from fungi. Fungi are notorious 
for forming huge numbers of very durable spores that could be readily spread. Microorganisms pose 
an even greater threat from exotic insect species introduced to areas where they previously were not 
found. This has threat to livestock. The outbreak of hoof and mouth disease in England that required 
destruction of tens of thousands of animals was mentioned above. Animals are subject to a number 
of viral and bacterial diseases. Perhaps the most notorious of these is anthrax, which can be spread 
to humans as well.
Perhaps the greatest terrorist threat to food supplies comes from potential contamination of edible 
products with pathogens. Human illnesses caused by bacterial contamination of food occur every 
year. Consumers were made ill and some died in the United States from Salmonella -contaminated 
peppers in 2008 and from peanuts contaminated by Salmonella from unsanitary handling conditions 
in 2008/2009. Terrorists could deliberately contaminate food with such pathogens, although it would 
be diffi  cult to do so on a large enough scale to sicken signifi  cant numbers of people.

Industrial Ecology
17.1 CHANGING THE BAD OLD WAYS
The chemical industry has come a long way in the approximately half century since the following 
was stated in American Chemical Industry—A History , by W. Haynes, Van Nostrand Publishers, 
1954: “By sensible defi  nition, any by-product of a chemical operation for which there is no profi  table 
use is a waste. The most convenient, least expensive way of disposing of said waste—up the chim-
ney or down the river—is the best.” Fortunately, this barbaric attitude toward waste has been long 
regarded as completely wrong and unacceptable. Environmental chemistry is largely involved with 
the problems caused by improper discharges of pollutants from the anthrosphere to the other envi-
ronmental spheres. This chapter deals largely with ways in which such problems can be avoided 
before environmental problems develop.
In recognition of the environmental effects of the chemical industry and related enterprises, 
many laws have been passed and implemented throughout the world to regulate chemical processes 
and products. These laws have emphasized dealing with environmental problems after they have 
occurred, a “command and control” approach. Compliance with environmental laws over the last 
several decades has involved the expenditure of more than a trillion dollars worldwide. These laws 
have unquestionably had very positive effects on environmental quality, have been effective in help-
ing to save some species from extinction, and have improved human health and quality of life. 
However, necessary as it is, the regulatory approach to enhancing environmental quality has some 
defi nite defi  ciencies. Its effective implementation and maintenance have required legions of regula-
tors and have resulted in the expenditure of vast sums for litigation that could be better used directly 
to enhance environmental quality. Especially from the viewpoint of those regulated, some regula-
tions have appeared to be petty, poorly cost effective, and, in the worst cases, counterproductive.
A modern industrial society will always require regulations of various kinds to maintain envi-
ronmental quality and even to ensure its continued existence. But, are there alternatives to some of 
the regulations? Most desirable are alternatives that help to ensure environmental quality by “natu-
ral,” self-regulating means. In recent years, it has become increasingly evident that, at least to a 
certain extent, there are alternatives to a purely regulatory approach for the chemical industry and 
other enterprises that have potentially huge infl  uences on the environment and sustainability.
One alternative to the regulatory approach to pollution control is provided in part by the practice 
of industrial ecology , which in its modern form can be traced to a 1989 article by Frosch and 
Gallopoulos.1 Industrial ecology views industrial systems as interacting to mutual advantage in a 
way that minimizes environmental and sustainability impacts and that processes materials and 
energy with maximum effi  ciency and minimum waste in a manner analogous to the metabolism 
of matter and energy in natural ecosystems. Starting in the mid-1990s, green chemistry  has devel-
oped as a dynamic and rapidly developing discipline dealing with the sustainable practice of chem-
istry. Green chemistry and industrial ecology are closely related and one cannot be practiced 
effectively without the other. This chapter addresses green chemistry and industrial ecology as 
essential  disciplines in maintaining environmental quality.454 Environmental Chemistry
17.2 GREEN CHEMISTRY
Green chemistry can be defi  ned as the sustainable practice of chemical science and technology 
within the framework of good practice of industrial ecology in a manner that is safe and nonpollut-
ing and that consumes minimum amounts of materials and energy while producing little or no waste 
material and which minimizes the use and handling of hazardous substances and does not release 
such substances to the environment .2 The inclusion of industrial ecology in this defi  nition carries 
with it a number of implications regarding minimum consumption of raw materials, maximum recy-
cling of materials, minimum production of unusable by-products, and other environmentally friendly 
factors favorable to the maintenance of sustainability. Figure 17.1 illustrates the main aspects of 
green chemistry.
A key aspect of green chemistry is sustainability . Ideally, green chemistry is self-sustaining for 
several reasons. One of these is economic because green chemistry in its most developed form is 
less costly in strictly monetary terms than chemistry the way it has been traditionally practiced. 
Green chemistry is sustainable in terms of materials because of its minimal but highly effi  cient use 
of raw materials. And green chemistry is sustainable in terms of wastes, because it does not cause 
an intolerable accumulation of hazardous waste products.
In implementing the practice of green chemistry, two often-complementary approaches are the 
following.
Use existing chemicals, but make them by environmentally benign syntheses.• 
Substitute chemicals made by environmentally benign syntheses for existing chemicals.• 
Both approaches need to be used. And both approaches challenge the ingenuity of chemists and 
chemical engineers to come up with innovative solutions to environmental problems arising from 
the chemical industry.
17.2.1 T WELVE  PRINCIPLES  OF GREEN CHEMISTRY
Green chemistry is guided by Twelve Principles of Green Chemistry ,3 aspects of which are  discussed 
in this chapter.
 1. Design chemical products and processes to prevent waste . One of life’s most common les-
sons is that it is better to not make a mess than to clean it up once made. Failure to follow

FIGURE 17.1 Illustration of the defi  nition of green chemistry, which emphasizes renewable feedstocks, 
exacting control, mild reaction conditions, maximum recycling of materials, minimal wastes, and degrad-
ability of products that might enter the environment.Green Chemistry and Industrial Ecology 455
this simple rule has resulted in most of the troublesome chemical hazardous waste sites 
that are causing problems throughout the world today.
 2. Design chemicals and products for maximum safety  while still maintaining their effective-
ness. The practice of green chemistry is making substantial progress in designing chemi-
cals and new approaches to the use of chemicals such that effectiveness is retained and 
even enhanced while toxicity is reduced.
 3. Minimize hazards  in chemical synthesis using and generating substances with minimum 
toxicity and environmental hazard. Substances to be avoided when possible include toxic 
chemicals that pose health hazards to workers. They include substances that are likely to 
become air or water pollutants and harm the environment or organisms in the environ-
ment. In cases in which hazardous substances cannot be avoided, only the minimum 
amount needed should be used or produced and only at the time the substances are required. 
Here the connection between green chemistry and environmental chemistry is especially 
strong.
 4. Use renewable feedstocks  wherever possible. Raw materials extracted from Earth are 
depleting in that there is a fi  nite supply that cannot be replenished after they are used. 
For these depleting feedstocks, recycling should be practiced to the maximum extent 
possible. Biomass feedstocks are highly favored in those applications for which they 
work. 
 5. Use catalysts  for optimum conditions of chemical synthesis and minimum by-product. 
Reagents should be as selective as possible for their specifi  c function.
 6. Avoid chemical derivatives  used as blocking agents and for other purposes in chemical 
synthesis to avoid generating excess by-products. In the synthesis of an organic compound 
it is often necessary to modify or protect groups on a molecule during the course of the 
synthesis. This often results in the generation of by-products not incorporated into the fi  nal 
product, such as occurs when a protecting group is bonded to a specifi  c location on a mol-
ecule, then removed when protection of the group is no longer needed. Since these pro-
cesses generate by-products that may require disposal, they should be avoided if possible.
 7. Maximize atom economy : One of the most effective ways to prevent generation of wastes 
is to make sure that the maximum fraction of materials involved in making a product are 
incorporated into the fi  nal product. Therefore, the practice of green chemistry is largely 
about incorporation of all raw materials into the product, if at all possible. The degree to 
which this is accomplished is termed atom economy.
 8. Use safer reaction media : Chemical synthesis as well as many manufacturing operations 
make use of auxiliary substances that are not part of the fi  nal product. In chemical synthe-
sis, such a substance consists of solvents in which chemical reactions are carried out. 
Another example consists of separating agents that enable separation of product from other 
materials. Since these kinds of materials may end up as wastes or (in the case of some vola-
tile, toxic solvents) pose health hazards, their use should be minimized and preferably 
avoided. 
 9. Increase energy effi  ciency : One way in which this can be done is to run reactions under 
mild temperature and pressure conditions, which also increases safety. Energy consump-
tion poses economic and environmental costs in virtually all synthesis and manufacturing 
processes. In a broader sense, the extraction of energy, such as fossil fuels pumped from or 
dug out of the ground, has signifi  cant potential to damage the environment. One successful 
approach to energy use under mild conditions has been the application of biological 
 processes, which, because of the conditions under which organisms grow, must occur at 
moderate temperatures and in the absence of toxic substances.
 10. Design for degradability  of chemicals and products to produce innocuous products upon 
degradation. This requires careful consideration of the downstream fates of products tak-
ing account of their environmental chemistry.456 Environmental Chemistry
 11. Use in-process real-time monitoring and control  to reduce wastes and pollution, maxi-
mize safety, and minimize energy consumption. Exacting “real-time” control of chemical 
processes is essential for effi  cient, safe operation with minimum production of wastes. 
This goal has been made much more attainable by modern computerized controls.
 12. Minimize the potential for accidents  by designing processes that use materials unlikely to 
cause explosions, fi  res, and harmful releases. Accidents, such as spills, explosions, and 
fi res, are a major hazard in the chemical industry. Not only are these incidents potentially 
dangerous in their own right, they tend to spread toxic substances into the environment and 
increase exposure of humans and other organisms to these substances.
Green chemistry is sustainable chemistry. There are several important respects in which green 
chemistry is sustainable.
Economic• : At a high level of sophistication green chemistry normally costs less in strictly 
economic terms (to say nothing of environmental costs) than chemistry as it is normally 
practiced.
Materials• : By effi  ciently using materials, maximum recycling, and minimum use of virgin 
raw materials, green chemistry is sustainable with respect to materials.
Waste• : By reducing insofar as possible, or even totally eliminating their production, green 
chemistry is sustainable with respect to wastes.
17.3 REDUCTION OF RISK: HAZARD AND EXPOSURE
A major goal in the manufacture and use of commercial products, and, indeed, in practically all 
areas of human endeavor, is the reduction of risk. Much of the design and practice of green chemis-
try is about risk reduction. There are two major aspects of risk—the hazard  presented by a product 
or process and exposure  of humans or other potential targets to those hazards:
 Risk = F{hazard ¥ exposure} (17.1)
This relationship simply states that risk is a function of hazard times exposure. It shows that risk can 
be reduced by a reduction of hazard, a reduction of exposure, and various combinations of both.
The command and control approach to reducing risk has concentrated upon reduction of exposure. 
Such efforts have used various kinds of controls and protective measures to limit exposure. The most 
common example of such a measure in the academic chemistry laboratory is the wearing of goggles 
to protect the eyes. Goggles will not by themselves prevent acid from splashing into the face of a stu-
dent, but they do prevent the acid from contacting fragile eye tissue. Explosion shields will not prevent 
explosions, but they do retain glass fragments that might harm the chemist or others in the vicinity.
Reduction of exposure is unquestionably effective in preventing injury and harm. However, it 
does require constant vigilance and even nagging of personnel, as any laboratory instructor charged 
with making laboratory students wear their safety goggles at all times will attest. It does not protect 
the unprotected, such as a visitor who may walk bare faced into a chemical laboratory ignoring the 
warnings for required eye protection. On a larger scale, protective measures may be very effective 
for workers in a chemical manufacturing operation but useless to those outside the area or the envi-
ronment beyond the plant walls who do not have protection. Protective measures are most effective 
against acute effects, but less so against long-term chronic exposures that may cause toxic responses 
over many years’ period of time. Finally, the protective equipment can fail and there is always the 
possibility that humans will not use it properly.
Where feasible, hazard reduction is a much more certain way of reducing risk than is exposure 
reduction. The human factors that play so prominently in successfully limiting exposure and that 
require a conscious, constant effort are much less crucial when hazards have been reduced. Compare, Green Chemistry and Industrial Ecology 457
for example, the use of a volatile, fl  ammable, somewhat toxic organic solvent employed for cleaning 
and degreasing of machined metal parts with that of a water solution of a nontoxic cleaning agent 
used for the same purpose. To safely work around the solvent requires an unceasing effort and con-
stant vigilance to avoid hazards such as formation of explosive mixtures with air, presence of igni-
tion sources that could result in a fi  re, and excessive exposure by inhalation or absorption through 
skin that might cause peripheral neuropathy (a nerve disorder) in workers. Failure of protective 
measures can result in a bad accident or serious harm to worker health. The water-based cleaning 
solution, however, would not present any of these hazards so that failure of protective measures 
would not create a problem.
Normally, measures taken to reduce risk by reducing exposure have an economic cost that can-
not be reclaimed in lower production costs or enhanced value of product. Of course, failure to 
reduce exposure can have direct, high economic costs in areas such as higher claims for worker 
compensation. In contrast, hazard reduction often has the potential to substantially reduce operating 
costs. Safer feedstocks are often less costly as raw materials. The elimination of costly control mea-
sures can lower costs overall. Again, to use the comparison of an organic solvent to a water-based 
cleaning solution, the organic solvent is almost certain to cost more than the aqueous solution con-
taining relatively low concentrations of detergents and other additives. Although the organic solvent 
will at least require purifi  cation for recycle and perhaps even expensive disposal as a hazardous 
waste, the water solution may be purifi  ed by relatively simple processes, and perhaps even biological 
treatment, then safely discharged as wastewater to a municipal wastewater treatment facility. It 
should be kept in mind, however, that not all low-hazard materials are cheap, and may be signifi  -
cantly more expensive than their more hazardous alternatives. And, in some cases, nonhazardous 
alternatives simply do not exist.
Since hazardous substances manifest their hazards largely through their chemical reactions and 
characteristics, it is convenient to classify them chemically . Although the chemical variability of 
hazardous substances make such a classifi  cation system somewhat inexact, several categories can be 
defi ned based on chemical behavior. These are the following:
Combustible•  and fl  ammable  substances, strong reducers that burn readily or violently in 
the presence of atmospheric oxygen
Oxidizers•  that provide oxygen for the combustion of reducers
Reactive • substances that are likely to undergo rapid, violent reactions, often in an unpre-
dictable manner
Corrosive•  substances that are generally sources of H+ ion or OH- ion and that tend to react 
destructively with materials, particularly metals
Some hazardous substances fall into more than one of these groups, which increases the dangers 
that they pose.
Often the greatest concern with hazardous substances has to do with toxicity. Toxic substances 
are not so easy to classify in terms of chemical properties as are substances belonging to the 
 classifi  cations listed above. It is more appropriate to classify toxic substances on the basis of their 
biochemical properties. Of special use in making these classifi  cations are structure–activity 
 relationships  that relate known structural features and functional groups to likely toxic effects.
Three kinds of hazardous substances stand out as candidates for reduction in the practice of 
green chemistry. The fi  rst of these consists of heavy metals , such as lead, mercury, or cadmium. As 
elements, these substances are indestructible. They have a wide range of adverse biological effects. 
Another category consists of persistent, nonbiodegradable organic materials , such as PCBs. Often 
not extremely toxic, these substances persist in the environment and exhibit a tendency to become 
magnifi  ed through biological food chains, adversely affecting organisms at or near the end of the 
food chain. The classic example of such compounds is insecticidal DDT, which caused reproductive 
problems for birds, such as falcons or eagles, at the top of the food chain. A third category of 458 Environmental Chemistry
 troublesome hazardous substances consists of volatile organic compounds  (VOCs). These have 
been particularly prevalent in industrial settings because of their uses as solvents for organic reac-
tions, vehicles in paints and coatings, and for cleaning parts. In the latter two applications, the most 
convenient means of dealing with these volatile materials was to allow them to evaporate, so that 
large quantities were simply discharged to the atmosphere.
17.3.1 T HE RISKS OF NOT TAKING  RISKS
There are limits to the reduction in risk beyond which efforts to do so become counterproductive. 
As in other areas of endeavor, there are circumstances in which there is no choice but to work with 
hazardous substances. Some things that are inherently dangerous are rendered safe by rigorous 
training, constant attention to potential hazards, and understanding of hazards and the best way to 
deal with them. Consider the analogy of commercial fl  ight. When a large passenger aircraft lands, 
100 ton of aluminum, steel, fl  ammable fuel, and fragile human fl  esh traveling at a speed of twice the 
legal interstate speed limits for automobiles come into sudden contact with an unforgiving concrete 
runway. That procedure is inherently dangerous! But it is carried out hundreds of thousands of times 
per year throughout the world with but few injuries and fatalities, a tribute to the generally superb 
design, construction, and maintenance of aircraft and the excellent skills and training of aircrew. 
The same principles that make commercial air fl  ight generally safe also apply to the handling of 
hazardous chemicals by properly trained personnel under carefully controlled conditions.
So, although much of this book is about risk reduction as it relates to chemistry, we must always 
be mindful of the risks of not taking risks. If we become so timid in all of our enterprises that we 
refuse to take risks, scientifi  c and economic progress will stagnate. If we get to the point that no 
chemical can be made if its synthesis involves the use of a potentially toxic or otherwise hazardous 
substance, the progress of chemical science and the development of such benefi  cial products as new 
life-saving drugs or innovative chemicals for treating water pollutants will be held back. Many argue 
that nuclear power entails signifi  cant risks as an energy source and that development of this power 
source must therefore be stopped. But, balance that potential risk against the virtually certain risk of 
continuing to use fossil fuels that produce greenhouse gases that cause global climate warming, and 
a strong case can be made for continued development of nuclear energy with newer reactor designs 
that incorporate strong safety features. Another example is the use of thermal processes for treating 
hazardous wastes, somewhat risky because of the potential for the release of toxic substances or air 
pollutants, but still the best way to convert many kinds of hazardous wastes to innocuous materials. 
17.4 WASTE PREVENTION AND GREEN CHEMISTRY
One of the basic goals of the practice of green chemistry is to reduce waste. Waste prevention is better 
than having to treat or clean up wastes. In the earlier years of chemical manufacture the direct costs 
associated with producing large quantities of wastes were very low because such wastes were simply 
discarded into waterways, onto the ground, or in the air as stack emissions. With the passage and 
enforcement of environmental laws after about 1970, costs for waste treatment increased steadily. 
One of the most commonly cited examples of costly waste remediation is the cleanup of PCBs in 
Hudson River (New York) sediment from PCBs that were discharged into the river as by-products of 
electrical equipment manufacture. General Electric has agreed to remove PCBs from sediments along 
65 km of the river requiring the movement of about 2.5 million cubic meters of material at a cost now 
estimated to be around $700 million. The cleanup of pollutants including asbestos, dioxins, pesticide 
manufacture residues, perchlorate, and mercury are costing various concerns hundreds of millions of 
dollars. From a purely economic standpoint, therefore, a green chemistry approach that avoids these 
costs is very attractive, in addition to its large environmental benefi  ts.
Although the costs of such things as engineering controls, regulatory compliance, personnel 
protection, wastewater treatment, and safe disposal of hazardous solid wastes have certainly been Green Chemistry and Industrial Ecology 459
worthwhile for society and the environment, they have become a large fraction of the overall cost of 
doing business. Companies must now do full cost accounting , which includes costs of emissions, 
waste disposal, cleanup, and protection of personnel and the environment. In industrialized coun-
tries, costs of complying with environmental and occupational health regulations are of a magnitude 
similar to those of research and development for industry as a whole.
Considering the economic costs, alone, waste prevention must have a high priority in addition to 
its being dictated by environmental considerations. Therefore, a top priority in the practice of green 
chemistry is to avoid producing wastes. In the past, this largely meant producing wastes as usual, 
then processing them to reduce their hazards or to salvage something of value from them. With the 
proper practice of green chemistry, it means designing and operating integrated systems which, by 
their nature, do not produce wastes.
17.5 GREEN CHEMISTRY AND SYNTHETIC CHEMISTRY
Synthetic chemistry  is the branch of chemical science involved with developing means of making 
new chemicals and developing improved ways of synthesizing existing chemicals. A key aspect of 
green chemistry is the involvement of synthetic chemists in the practice of environmental chemis-
try. Synthetic chemists, whose major objective has always been to make new substances and to 
make them cheaper and better, have come relatively late to the practice of environmental chemistry 
and green chemistry. Other areas of chemistry have been involved much longer in pollution preven-
tion and environmental protection. From the beginning, analytical chemistry has been a key to 
discovering and monitoring the severity of pollution problems. Physical chemistry has played a 
strong role in explaining and modeling environmental chemical phenomena. The application of 
physical chemistry to atmospheric photochemical reactions has been especially useful in explaining 
and preventing harmful atmospheric chemical effects including photochemical smog formation and 
stratospheric ozone depletion. Other branches of chemistry have been instrumental in studying vari-
ous environmental chemical phenomena. Now synthetic chemists, those who make chemicals and 
whose activities drive chemical processes, have become much more involved in making the manu-
facture, use, and ultimate disposal of chemicals as environmentally friendly as possible.
Before environmental and health and safety issues gained their current prominence, the economic 
aspects of chemical manufacture and distribution were relatively simple. The economic factors 
involved included costs of feedstock, energy requirements, and marketability of product. Now, how-
ever, costs must include those arising from regulatory compliance, liability, end-of-pipe waste treat-
ment, and costs of waste disposal. By eliminating or greatly reducing the use of toxic or hazardous 
feedstocks, catalysts, and reaction media, and by avoiding the generation of dangerous intermedi-
ates and by-products, green chemistry eliminates or greatly diminishes the additional costs that have 
come to be associated with meeting environmental and safety requirements of conventional chemi-
cal manufacture. 
As illustrated in Figure 17.2, there are two general and often complementary approaches to the 
implementation of green chemistry in chemical synthesis, both of which challenge the imaginations 
of chemists and chemical engineers. The fi  rst of these is to use existing feedstocks but make them 
by more environmentally benign processes. The second approach is to substitute other feedstocks 
that are made by environmentally benign approaches. In some cases, a combination of the two 
approaches is used.
17.5.1 Y IELD AND ATOM ECONOMY
Traditionally, synthetic chemists have used yield , defi ned as a percentage of the degree to which a 
chemical reaction or synthesis goes to completion, to measure the success of a chemical synthesis. 
For example, if a chemical reaction shows that 100 g of product should be produced, but only 85 g 
is produced, the yield is 85%. A synthesis with a high yield may still generate signifi  cant quantities 460 Environmental Chemistry
of useless by-products if the reaction does so as part of the synthesis process. Instead of yield, green 
chemistry emphasizes atom economy , the fraction of reactant material that actually ends up in fi  nal 
product. Atom economy is expressed by the equation
 =Molar mass desired productAtom economyTotal molar mass of materials generated (17.2)
With 100% atom economy, all of the material that goes into the synthesis process is incorporated 
into the product. For effi  cient utilization of raw materials, a 100% atom economy process is most 
desirable. Figure 17.3 illustrates the concepts of yield and atom economy.Chemical synthesis

FIGURE 17.2 Two general approaches to the implementation of green chemistry. The dashed loops on the 
left represent alternative approaches to environmentally benign means of providing chemicals already used for 
chemical synthesis. A second approach, where applicable, is to substitute entirely different, environmentally 
safer raw materials.

Another quantitative measure of green chemistry is the E-factor based on waste produced rela-
tive to the amount of product.4 In its simplest form the mathematical expression of the E-factor is the 
following:
 Total mass of wasteE-factorTotal mass of product=
 (17.3)
17.6 FEEDSTOCKS
A crucial decision that must be made in implementing a process to manufacture a chemical or 
 product is selection of feedstock  from which the product is made. To the extent possible, the feed-
stock should place minimal demands on the earth’s resources. It should be a relatively safe material, 
and its acquisition and refi  ning should be safe. In some cases the processes and reagents required to 
isolate an otherwise safe feedstock make its acquisition hazardous, such as in the use of highly toxic 
cyanide to remove low levels of gold from ore. Wherever possible, a feedstock should be renewable ; 
for example, feedstocks from biomass that can be grown repeatedly are often preferable to deplet-
able petroleum feedstocks.
In a generalized sense, the overall process of obtaining a useful product from a feedstock, such 
as petroleum or biological materials, can be divided into the three categories shown in Figure 17.4. 
Both the petroleum and biological sources of potential feedstocks are relatively well known. For 
petroleum feedstocks, the technology for separation has been developed to a high degree of sophis-
tication. The technologies for obtaining raw materials from plant sources, such as extraction of oils 
with solvents or separation of cellulose from lignin in wood, are also well advanced. Because of the 
high degree of development of the petrochemical industry, the science of converting petroleum

feedstocks.
17.6.1 B IOLOGICAL  FEEDSTOCKS
With some billions of tons of carbon fi  xed as biomass each year, there exists an enormous potential 
for the use of biological materials as feedstocks. The most obvious such material consists of wood 
from trees. Large quantities of cellulose are generated each year in the production of crops such as 
corn and wheat. Although a fraction of crop by-product biomass should be returned to soil to main-
tain its condition as a growth medium for plants, there is a substantial excess that could be used as 
feedstock. Biological processes, particularly plant growth, produce a number of potentially useful 
biopolymers including, in addition to cellulose, hemicellulose, starch, lignin, lipids, and proteins. 
Plants are also useful sources of smaller molecules, including monosaccharides (glucose),

chemistry.462 Environmental Chemistry
 disaccharides (sucrose), amino acids, waxes, fats, oils, and terpene hydrocarbons, including those 
used to make natural rubber. The potential of genetic engineering to produce plants that have high 
yields of feedstock chemicals could lead to the development of exciting new sources of biological 
feedstocks.
Potential feedstocks from biological sources tend to be more complex than those from petroleum. 
This offers the advantage of starting with a material in which much of the synthesis required to 
make a product has already been done by a living plant. Furthermore, many desired products have 
relatively high oxygen contents, and biological materials tend to contain bound oxygen. This can 
avoid the operation of converting a petroleum-based hydrocarbon feedstock to an oxygenated com-
pound, which often requires severe conditions, hazardous oxidizing agents, and potentially trouble-
some catalysts. In some cases, however, the complexity of biological feedstocks is a disadvantage 
because it is usually more diffi  cult to convert a complex molecule to a signifi  cantly different one 
than it is when starting with a relatively simple feedstock.
Biological feedstocks are often complex mixtures of materials that require separation,  processing, 
and purifi  cation. Factories that perform these functions on biological feedstocks are biorefi  neries .5 
Biorefi  neries should be designed and operated in keeping with the best practice of green chemistry. 
This would include such things as using fermentation-produced ethanol or supercritical carbon 
dioxide (see Section 17.9) as solvents, the use of biocatalysts where possible, avoidance of severe 
conditions, and high effi  ciency of energy utilization.
Arguably the most important biological raw materials for chemical synthesis are carbohydrates 
produced by plants, including glucose, fructose, sucrose, starch, and 
GlucoseCC

cellulose. Starch and cellulose are large-molecule polymers of glucose, the structural formulas of 
which are represented in Chapter 22, Figures 22.4 and 22.5. Carbohydrates, such as starch from 
corn grain and sucrose from sugar cane, are generated in high quantities by a number of plants. 
Furthermore, ce ll ul os i c w astes can be h y dro l yzed to g enerate s imp l e sugars that can be used in 
chemical synthesis. A major advantage of carbohydrates in chemical synthesis is their abundance of 
hydroxyl functional groups, as shown in the structural formula of glucose above. Such functionality 
provides sites for the attachment of other functionalities and for initiating chemical reactions lead-
ing to desired products. The inherent biodegradability of carbohydrates provides them with some 
environmental advantages as well.
The most abundant biomaterial produced by plants is cellulose. Cellulose currently has a number 
of uses as a feedstock, and these will grow in the future as plant biomass supplants diminishing 
petroleum feedstocks.
In addition to cellulose, a very abundant material in plant biomass is lignin, a complex binding 
material that serves to hold wood and other plant materials together. Unlike carbohydrate cellulose, 
which has a uniform structure and is composed entirely of glucose monomer units, lignin has a vari-
able three-dimensional molecular structure, the most common feature of which is the phenylpro-
pane unit (a benzene ring attached to a three-carbon chain) along with other hydrocarbon and 
oxygen-containing groups. The molecular masses of lignin may exceed 15,000. Lignin’s variability 
severely limits its use as a chemical feedstock. A major detriment to the use of lignin in green chem-
istry is its resistance to any sort of biological processes that might be considered for its conversion 
to useful products. One of the more promising potential uses for abundant lignin resources is the 
production of phenolic compounds.Green Chemistry and Industrial Ecology 463
Described in Chapter 22, Section 22.5, lipids are substances that can be extracted from biological 
materials by organic solvents. Lipids and hydrocarbon terpenes produced by plants have a number 
of potential uses as feedstocks. Relatively high in hydrogen and carbon and low in oxygen contents, 
lipids are oils, greases, and waxes with properties similar to a number of materials in petroleum. 
Some lipids can be used to synthesize synthetic liquid fuels and can even be used directly as diesel 
fuel. An early diesel engine that won the Grand Prize at the Paris Exhibition of 1900 ran on peanut 
oil, chosen because the French government wanted to promote this material produced in abundance 
in some of its African colonies.
Oils and fats from biological sources are very important raw materials for the chemical industry.6 
These materials provide a variety of fatty acids including oleic acid from new strains of sunfl  ower, 
linolenic acid from soybean and linseed, rinoleic acid from castor oil, erucic acid from rapeseed, 
and a variety of oils from newly available plant sources. For chemical synthesis, the fatty acids from 
natural sources offer advantages because of the carboxylic acid group and, for some fatty acids, the 
presence of reactive C =C double bonds in the carbon chain.
17.7 REAGENTS
Reagents  are chemical agents that act upon feedstocks in synthesis. A reagent may be partly or even 
fully incorporated into a product, or it may act to produce a chemical change in the feedstock. 
Judicious selection of reagents for carrying out chemical processes can be a crucial factor in devel-
oping a successful green chemistry process. Use of a benign feedstock may be of relatively little use 
if large quantities of hazardous reagents are required for its processing.
Two important factors driving reagent selection are product selectivity  and product yield . High 
product selectivity means higher conversion of raw material to the desired product with minimal 
by-product generation. High product yield means a high percentage of the desired product is obtained 
relative to the maximum yield calculated from stoichiometric considerations. Both high-product 
selectivity and high-product yield reduce the amounts of extraneous material that must be handled 
and separated.
In selecting safe reagents and feedstocks, consideration of structure–activity relationships can be 
very useful. It is known that certain structural features or functional groups tend to create particular 
kinds of hazards. For example, the presence of oxygen and nitrogen—particularly multiple nitrogen 
atoms—in close proximity in a molecule tends to make it reactive or even explosive. The presence 
of the N -N=O functional group means that a compound is an N–nitroso  compound ( nitrosamine ), 
many of which are carcinogenic. The ability to donate methyl groups to biomolecules may make a 
compound mutagenic or carcinogenic; substitution of longer-chain hydrocarbon groups can reduce 
this hazard.
In evaluating the safety of reagents and choosing safer alternatives, special attention should be 
given to functional groups  consisting of particular groupings of atoms. The carcinogenic potential of 
the N -N=O group was mentioned above. Aldehydes tend to be irritants to animals and are photo-
chemically active, so that they can contribute to smog formation when released to the atmosphere. 
Whenever possible it is best to use alternative compounds when particular functional groups are 
likely to be a problem. It is also sometimes possible to mask functional groups to produce less danger-
ous forms, and then unmask them at the point in the synthesis where the functionality is needed.
Oxidation  is one of the most common operations in chemical synthesis. The nature of oxidation 
often requires harsh conditions and harsh reagents, such as permanganate (MnO4-), chromium(VI) 
compounds (such as potassium dichromate, K2Cr2O7), toxic and costly osmium tetroxide, or 
m- chloroperbenzoic acid. Therefore, one of the main objectives of green chemistry has been the 
development of more benign oxidizing agents and oxidation reactions.
Reduction is a common operation in chemical synthesis. As with oxidation, the reagents used for 
reduction tend to be reactive and diffi  cult to handle. Two of the most common such reagents are 
lithium aluminum hydride, LiAlH4, which is fl  ammable and rather hazardous to use, and tributyltin 464 Environmental Chemistry
hydride, which can release volatile, toxic tin-containing products. Both oxidizing and reducing 
agents used in chemical synthesis produce by-products that must be carefully disposed of at signifi  -
cant expense. 
Alkylation  consists of the attachment of alkyl groups, such as the methyl group, –CH3, to an organic 
molecule. The attachment of an alkyl group to a nitrogen atom in an amine is used as a step in the 
synthesis of a variety of dyes, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, plant growth regulators, and other specialty 
chemicals. In such cases, alkylation is commonly carried out using alkyl halides or alkyl sulfates in 
the presence of a base as shown below for the attachment of a methyl group to N in aniline:
 N
NH

 (17.4)
This kind of reaction produces signifi  cant amounts of inorganic salt by-product, such as Na2SO4. 
Also, alkyl halides and alkyl sulfates pose toxicity concerns; dimethyl sulfate is a suspect human 
carcinogen.
Relatively nontoxic dialkyl carbonates are very effective alkylating agents that promise to pro-
vide a safer alternative to alkyl halides or sulfates for some kinds of alkylation reactions. The prom-
ise of dimethyl carbonate for methylation (alkylation in which the methyl group, -CH3, is attached) 
has been enhanced by the straightforward synthesis of this compound from methanol and carbon 
monoxide in the presence of a copper salt:

Dimethyl carbonate can be used for methylation of nitrogen in amine compounds at a tempera-
ture of 180 ∞C under continuous-fl  ow gas–liquid phase-transfer catalysis conditions (which involve 
transfer of organic ionic reactant species between water and an organic phase) as shown below for 
the methylation of aniline:

The use of dimethyl carbonate as a methylating agent offers the twin advantages of up to 99% 
effi ciency of conversion to product with selectivities of 99% or more for the monomethyl product. 
The by-products are innocuous carbon dioxide and methanol, which can be recirculated through the 
process for making dimethyl carbonate (Reaction 17.5). Dimethyl carbonate is useful, for example, 
in making monomethyl organonitrogen derivatives required for the synthesis of analgesics, such as 
ibuprofen.
17.8 STOICHIOMETRIC AND CATALYTIC REAGENTS
In discussions of green chemistry distinction is often made between stoichiometric reactions and 
catalytic reactions. A stoichiometric reaction  written in a generalized form as
 A + B + C Æ Product + D + E  (17.7)Green Chemistry and Industrial Ecology 465
is one in which two or more substances enter into a reaction to provide a desired product. If the reac-
tion is simply that between A and B and if all these reagents are consumed to yield product, the 
reaction is 100% atom-effi  cient. Such an ideal is rarely realized in practice because (1) either A or 
B is a limiting reagent and one of the other reagents is left over, (2) only part of at least one of the 
reactants ends up in product, and (3) additional reagents are required to make the reaction proceed.
Where possible, it is preferable to replace stoichiometric reactions with catalytic reactions  in 
which, ideally, a catalyst that is not itself consumed enables the reaction to occur rapidly, specifi  -
cally, and with 100% atom effi  ciency. The distinction between stoichiometric and catalytic reactions 
can be illustrated with the example of the synthesis of ethylene oxide, widely used in the synthesis 
of ethylene glycol (antifreeze), ethylene glycol ester solvents, polyesters, ethanolamines, and other 
products, outlined in Figure 17.5. Although it gives relatively high yields, the stoichiometric chloro-
hydrin route to ethylene oxide requires hazardous and expensive chlorine gas as a reagent and pro-
duces 3.5 kg of waste calcium chloride per kilogram ethylene oxide product. The catalytic route 
gives an approximately 80% yield without generating by-products and the unreacted reagents can 
simply be recycled through the synthesis. By 1975, the catalytic route had supplanted the  chlorhydrin 
synthesis pathway.
17.9 MEDIA AND SOLVENTS
Media  is a term used to refer to the matrix in which or on which chemical processes occur. The type 
and strength of interaction between the media and reactants in a chemical process play a very 
important role in determining the type, degree, and rate of the process. Although media may include 
solids upon which reactions take place, by far the most common type of media consists of liquid 
solvents  in which reagents are dissolved. Solvents interact to various extents and in various ways 
with the solutes dissolved in them. An important phenomenon is solvation , in which the solvent 
molecules interact with solute molecules. A common example of this is the attraction of polar water 
solvent molecules for dissolved cations and anions. This ability makes water an extraordinarily 
good solvent for ionic substances—acids, bases, and salts—that are commonly used in chemical 
reactions. The ability of water to form hydrogen bonds is particularly important in its ability to dis-
solve a wide range of biological materials capable of forming hydrogen bonds.
Beyond their uses as reaction media, solvents have other uses, particularly in separation, purifi  ca-
tion, and cleaning. Water is the most abundant and safest solvent and should be used wherever pos-
sible. In fact, one of the main objectives of the practice of green chemistry is to convert  processes to One Step Catalytic Route to Ethylene Oxide SynthesisEthylene oxide

the use of water solvent wherever possible. However, water is not a suitable solvent for a wide range 
of organic substances used industrially. Therefore, the use of organic solvents consisting of hydro-
carbons and hydrocarbon derivatives, such as chlorinated hydrocarbons, is unavoidable in many 
cases. In addition to serving as reaction media, organic solvents are used as cleaners, degreasers, and 
as extractants to remove organic substances from solids. A major use of organic solvents is as the 
liquid vehicle  to enable the application, spreading, and impregnation (such as of cloth) of dissolved or 
suspended dyes and other agents in formulations of paints, coatings, inks, and related materials.
By their nature, solvents cause more environmental and health problems than do other partici-
pants in the chemical synthesis process. Most solvents are volatile and tend to escape into the work-
place and atmosphere. Hydrocarbon solvents are fl  ammable and can form explosive mixtures with 
air. Released to the atmosphere, they can be instrumental in causing formation of photochemical 
smog (see Chapter 13). A number of adverse health effects are attributed to solvents. Carbon tetra-
chloride, CCl4, causes lipid peroxidation in the body that can result in severe damage to the liver. 
Benzene causes blood disorders and is suspected of causing leukemia. Volatile C5–C7 alkanes dam-
age nerves and can result in a condition known as peripheral neuropathy. The possibility of their 
being carcinogenic is always a consideration in dealing with solvents in the workplace.
A key consideration in selecting and using a solvent for the proper practice of green chemistry 
consists of its toxicological and environmental effects on biological systems. This obviously includes 
toxic effects to humans. Physical properties, such as volatility, density, and solubility, are important 
in estimating potential environmental and biological effects. Lipophilicity, the tendency to dissolve 
lipid tissue, is a measure of the ability of a solvent to penetrate skin and hence is an important factor 
in determining its biological effects. The environmental persistence and biodegradation of solvents 
should be considered. Special care must be taken to not use or at least prevent the release to the 
atmosphere of volatile solvents that may become involved in photochemical reactions leading to 
photochemical smog formation. The formerly widespread use of volatile chlorofl  uorocarbon (CFC) 
solvents as blowing agents to produce porous plastics and plastic foams resulted in widespread dis-
sipation of these ozone destroying CFC vapors to the atmosphere (see Chapter 14).
Much of the progress that has been made toward the goal of green chemistry has come with 
replacement of potentially troublesome solvents with less dangerous ones. Some pertinent examples 
of such replacement are shown in Table 17.1. The best solvent to use, when possible, is water. It is 
discussed below.
17.9.1 W ATER, THE GREENEST  SOLVENT
Although it does not truly dissolve hydrophobic organic substances, water may hold such substances 
in suspension as fi  nely divided colloidal matter, thus in some cases enabling its use in place of organic 
solvents as a medium for organic reactions and for other applications. In addition to its not dissolving 
organic substances, water suffers from the disadvantage of reacting strongly with some reagents, 
such as AlCl3 used in Friedel–Crafts reactions, strongly reducing LiAlH4, and metallic sodium used 
in some applications. On the other hand, precisely because water is such a poor solvent for organic 
substances—the hydrophobic effect —some organic reactions proceed better in a water medium than 
in organic solvents. Water is an excellent solvent for some of the more hydrophilic biological mole-
cules, such as glucose, that are gaining favor as reactants for green chemical processes.
Largely ignored during the development of organic synthesis, water is getting renewed attention 
as a medium for organic chemical reactions and processes. This is due largely to water being the 
ultimate green solvent with no detrimental environmental, safety (fl  ammability), or toxicological 
aspects to its use. As the price for feedstocks for making organic solvents has increased, the fact that 
water is essentially free increases its attractiveness. Water is a good solvent for many biological mate-
rials that are gaining favor as green chemistry feedstocks, and, as discussed above, its repulsion of 
some organophilic reagents can be advantageous in some cases. Water-insoluble organic products are 
readily separated from water without having to distill off an organic solvent. The control of heat and Green Chemistry and Industrial Ecology 467
temperature is an important aspect of many chemical processes. For heat and temperature control, 
water is the best solvent to use because of its very high heat capacity (see Chapter 3, Table 3.1).
17.9.2 D ENSE PHASE CARBON  DIOXIDE  AS A SOLVENT
Substances that are normally considered to be gases take on special properties when highly com-
pressed. The general diagram shown in Figure 17.6 shows that, at temperatures exceeding a critical 
temperature, Tc, and pressures exceeding a critical pressure, Pc, the distinction between liquid and 
gas disappears and a substance becomes a supercritical fl  uid . The most widely studied supercritical 
fl uid is that formed by carbon dioxide, for which Tc is 31.1 ∞C and Pc is 73.8 atm. Supercritical fl  uids 
have many useful solvent properties. It has also been found, however, that highly compressed car-
bon dioxide below the critical point, where it is not supercritical, but may exist as a mixture of liquid 
and gas, has some excellent solvent properties as well. The term dense phase fl  uid  is used to desig-
nate a highly compressed, dense substance that may be a supercritical fl  uid, highly compressed gas, 
or mixture of gas and liquid.
Dense phase fl  uids have a number of interesting solvent properties and have been extensively 
investigated as extractants and for chromatographic separations (supercritical fl  uid chromato-
graphy). An important characteristic of these fl  uids is their much lower viscosities than conventional 
liquids; that of supercritical CO2 is only about 1/30 the viscosity of liquids normally used as sol-
vents. This means that solutes diffuse much more readily in supercritical fl  uids, thus enabling them 
to react much faster. The wide latitude within which pressures and temperatures of dense phase 
fl uids may be changed enables their properties to be varied widely.
Supercritical fl  uid carbon dioxide is an excellent solvent for organic solutes. This has led to its 
uses in place of organochlorine solvents for cleaning metal parts and in dry cleaning. A major 
advantage of supercritical fl  uid carbon dioxide in some applications is that it is readily evaporated TABLE 17.1

from solutes by releasing pressure. This has led to interest in the solvent as a vehicle for paints and 
coatings. With the appropriate apparatus, the released carbon dioxide can be reclaimed and recom-
pressed back to a supercritical state for recycling. This capability tends to overcome criticism of the 
use of carbon dioxide, which is, of course, a greenhouse gas when released to the atmosphere. 
Supercritical fl  uid carbon dioxide has a highly organophilic nature, which may be excessive for 
some applications with more polar or ionic solutes. Addition of polar cosolvents, such as methyl 
alcohol, can overcome this disadvantage. A further advantage of supercritical fl  uid carbon dioxide 
as a solvent is its ability to dissolve gases, enhanced by the very high pressure under which super-
critical fl  uid carbon dioxide must be maintained. This enables reactions to occur effi  ciently with 
gaseous reactants in supercritical fl  uid carbon dioxide that would otherwise not be possible.
Supercritical fl  ui ds ha v e some disad v an tag es. The ma jor disad v an tag e o f such so l v en ts is the 
special apparatus required to maintain relatively severe supercritical conditions. However, super-
critical fl  uid carbon dioxide’s advantages of low cost, high abundance from a number of sources, 
nontoxic nature, nonfl  ammability, and the fact that it is not classifi  ed as a volatile organic solvent 
are leading to increased uses of this solvent.
17.9.3 G AS-EXPANDED  SOLVENTS
Some of the handling and safety issues involved with the use of supercritical carbon dioxide can be 
overcome with gas-expanded solvents  that are composed of subcritical pressurized gas (usually 
carbon dioxide) in contact with an organic solvent. The carbon dioxide dissolves in the organic 
liquid and expands the volume of the liquid several fold. As much as 80% of the organic solvent can 
be replaced by this approach. The properties of the solvent are altered signifi  cantly by the presence 
of carbon dioxide. An interesting possibility is that carbon dioxide, which is used in fi  re extinguish-
ers, can render volatile hydrocarbon solvents much less fl  ammable enabling their substitution for 
environmentally and toxicologically problematic chlorinated hydrocarbon liquids.
17.10 ENHANCING REACTIONS
One of the most important aspects of green chemistry is the enhancement of the speed and 
degree of completion of chemical reactions. The two major ways in which this can be done are 
by adding energy to the reaction system or by reducing the activation energy required to make 
the reaction go.
Catalysts are substances that enable reactions to proceed more rapidly (or at all). Catalysts can 
enable all kinds of reactions including oxidation, reduction, and a variety of organic reactions. The TemperaturePressure

FIGURE 17.6 Temperature–pressure plot showing supercriticality.Green Chemistry and Industrial Ecology 469
choice of catalysts is very important in the practice of green chemistry because they can add to the 
hazards of chemical processes and produce troublesome by-products and product contaminants. 
This can occur, for example, with homogeneous catalysts that are intimately mixed with the 
reagents involved in chemical synthesis. Catalysts that are most amenable to the practice of green 
chemistry are heterogeneous catalysts, such as molecular sieves, that can be kept entirely separate 
from products. Insofar as possible, such catalysts should be nontoxic.
In general, the greenest catalysts are enzymes that have developed in organisms to carry out 
biochemical processes.7 Because they developed in organisms under conditions conducive to life, 
enzymatic reactions are by their nature carried out in water under ambient temperature and pressure 
conditions. They are generally very rapid and specifi  c. Such reactions have been used for thousands 
of years in fermentation processes, such as the conversion of sucrose in cane sugar to glucose and 
fructose sugars by invertase  enzymes and the subsequent fermentation of these two monosaccha-
rides to ethanol by zymase  enzyme in yeasts. In recent years, aided by recombinant DNA (genetic 
engineering) techniques, enzyme processes have been developed to carry out a wide variety of 
chemical processes. Among the functions that enzyme catalysts can perform are oxidation and 
reduction reactions, hydrolysis reactions, transfer of functional groups to or from organic molecules, 
and additions to groups across double bonds or the reverse.
The most basic way of introducing energy into a reaction system is by external heating. This can 
be done by simply heating a reaction vessel from the outside, with steam coils immersed in a reac-
tion vessel, or by resistance-heated electrical coils immersed in the reaction system. The practice of 
green chemistry seeks to develop more elegant means of introducing energy into a reaction system 
as alternatives to external heating.
Microwaves  can be used to add energy to reactions to enhance reaction rates. Microwaves are 
electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths of 1 cm to 1 m (frequency 30 GHz to 300 Hz). To avoid 
interference with microwave bands used in communication, industrial and household microwave 
generators commonly operate at 2.45 GHz. Microwaves are absorbed by polar molecules, such as 
those of water, causing rapid re-orientation of the molecules in a microwave fi  eld. The result is a 
high input of energy directly into substances subjected to microwaves thereby adding energy and 
speeding up reactions. Microwave energy can be put directly into relatively small volumes of reac-
tion media, reducing material requirements and minimizing w astes. Micro w a v es can be used to 
enhance reactions in (1) water media, (2) polar organic solvents such as dimethylformamide, and (3) 
media-free reactions, such as mixed solid reactants.
Subjecting a reaction medium to ultrasound energy at frequencies between 20 and 100 kHz can 
introduce very high energy pulses into the medium. This approach to enhancing reactions is com-
monly called sonochemistry . Commonly, the ultrasound is produced by the piezoelectric effect 
through which crystals of substances such as ceramic impregnated barium titanate are subjected to 
rapidly reversing electrical fi  elds converting the electrical energy to sound energy with an effi  ciency 
that can reach 95%. An advantage of sonochemistry is that it can introduce high energy into micro-
scopic regions enabling reactions to occur wi thout appreciably heating the reaction medium.
The passage of a direct current of electricity through a reaction medium can cause both reduc-
tions and oxidations to occur. Reduction, the addition of electrons, e-, can occur at the relatively 
negatively charged cathode, and oxidation, the loss of electrons, at the relatively positively charged 
anode. A simple example of an electrochemical process used to manufacture industrial chemicals 
occurs when a direct current is passed through molten sodium chloride, NaCl to produce elemental 
sodium and elemental chlorine. At the cathode, sodium ion is reduced:
 Na+ + e- Æ Na( l) (17.8)
and at the anode, chloride ion is oxidized to elemental chlorine gas:
 2Cl- Æ Cl2(g) + 2e- (17.9)470 Environmental Chemistry
giving the following net reaction:
 2Na+ + 2Cl- Æ 2Na( l) + Cl2(g) (17.10)
The reaction utilizes electrical energy effi  ciently and occurs with 100% atom economy.
Electrochemical oxidation and reduction can be controlled by the potentials applied, by the 
media in which they occur, and by the electrodes used. In a sense, electrochemical processes use 
“matter-free” reagents; no other approach comes any closer to the attainment of ideal green 
chemistry.
Photochemical reactions  use the energy of photons of light or ultraviolet radiation to cause reac-
tions to occur. For electromagnetic radiation of frequency n, the energy of a photon is given by the 
equation E = hn, where h is Planck’s constant. Since a photon can be absorbed directly by a mole-
cule or a functional group on a molecule, the application of electromagnetic radiation of the appro-
priate energy to a reaction medium can introduce a high amount of energy into a reactant species 
without signifi  cantly heating the medium. Photochemical energy can be used to cause synthesis 
reactions to occur more effi  ciently and with less production of waste by-products than nonphoto-
chemical processes.8,9 One example is the acylation of benzoquinone with an aldehyde to produce 
an acylhydroquinone, an intermediate used to make some specialty polymers:

(R is a hydrocarbon group)  (17.11)
This reaction occurs with 100% atom economy. Unlike the standard Friedel–Crafts type of reaction, 
which utilizes the catalytic effect of Lewis acid-type acidic halides, particularly aluminum chloride, 
AlCl3, the photochemical process does not require moisture- and air-sensitive, potentially reactive 
catalytic substances.
A reagent does not have to absorb a photon directly to undergo a photochemically induced reac-
tion. In some cases photochemically reactive species may be added that absorb photons, then pro-
duce reactive excited species or free radicals that carry out additional reactions. An example of this 
is provided with hydrogen peroxide, which absorbs photons

to produce reactive hydroxyl radicals that react with a number of other species.
17.11 INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY
Figure 17.7 illustrates the old way of industrial production that prevailed in the earlier days of the 
industrial revolution. Raw materials and energy were taken from nonrenewable sources, including 
wood from old growth timber, and products were made without consideration of wastes or pollut-
ants. Air and water pollutants were simply released to the atmosphere and waterways, respectively, 
and by-product solid, semisolid, and liquid wastes were placed in the geosphere without consider-
ation of their effects. After products were used, they were simply discarded to the environment 
without thought of environmental effects. The idea of sustainability was a foreign concept. As a 
result, air and water became polluted and the land was littered with waste dumps and discarded 
consumer products.
Some of the ill effects of reckless production without regard to sustainability were noted in 
Section 17.1. At the beginning of this chapter it was mentioned that a viable alternative to the old Green Chemistry and Industrial Ecology 471
unsustainable ways is provided in part by the practice of industrial ecology, which emerged as a 
recognized discipline around 1 990. Industrial ecology  is a comprehensive approach to produc-
tion, distribution, utilization, and termination of goods and services in a manner that maximizes 
mutually benefi  cial utilization of materials and energy among enterprises, thereby minimizing 
consumption of nonrenewable raw materials and energy while preventing the production of wastes 
and pollutants.10 The practice of industrial ecology involves optimization of materials utilization 
starting with raw material and progressing through fi  nished material, to component, to product, 
and fi  nally to the fi  nal fate of obsolete product and its components. In addition to materials and 
resources, industrial ecology considers energy and capital. 
Figure 17.8 shows industrial ecology operating in an idealized manner. This fi  gure illustrates the 
minimal inputs of raw materials and energy, minimum production of wastes, and maximum circula-
tion of materials within the systems that are characteristic of ideal systems of industrial ecology.
Industrial ecology is analogous to ecology in nature in which organisms create intricate inter-
dependent webs whereby individual kinds of organisms utilize waste products from others for their 
own needs. This results in extremely high effi  ciencies of resource utilization in nature with essen-
tially zero wastes. Organisms operate in natural ecosystems. Similarly, enterprises that practice 
industrial ecology operate in industrial ecosystems.
Several important analogies exist between industrial ecology and natural ecology. One of these 
is the analogy behind the evolution of organisms and their ecosystems through natural selection in 
which those organisms most suited to particular environments evolve through genetic processes. 
Similarly, systems of industrial ecology have evolved through natural selection processes. If a waste 
product becomes available, an enterprise is likely to develop to utilize the product. If a more effi  -
cient enterprise for utilizing the waste appears, it will become dominant. These kinds of practices 
have occurred ever since industries fi  rst emerged, centuries before industrial ecology was formally 
recognized. It should be kept in mind that with current understanding of the nature of industrial 
ecology, something like “intelligent design” has the potential to be applied to industrial ecosystems. 
Based on knowledge of industrial enterprises, their needs, and their markets, and utilizing the enor-
mous computing powers now available to planners, systems of industrial ecology can be planned, 
constructed, and operated that are functional and effi  cient.Raw materials,

resources or consideration of pollutant release or waste disposal.472 Environmental Chemistry
Just as natural ecosystems are not static and undergo ecological succession, such as  grasslands Æ 
shrublands Æ forests, industrial ecosystems undergo a form of ecological succession. Rapid devel-
opments in manufacturing techniques, changes in sources of raw materials or energy, and shifting 
markets will inevitably change the mix of enterprises in an industrial ecosystem and the ways in 
which they interact. Therefore, a form of natural selection must operate to provide the most effi  cient 
possible systems of industrial ecology.
17.12 THE FIVE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF AN INDUSTRIAL ECOSYSTEM
Industrial ecosystems include all aspects of production, processing, and consumption. As shown in 
Figure 17.8, there are several distinct components of an industrial ecosystem, which can be catego-
rized as the following: these are (1) a primary materials producer, (2) a source or sources of energy, 
(3) a materials processing and manufacturing sector, (4) a waste processing sector, and (5) a con-
sumer sector. In such an idealized system operating with the best practice of industrial ecology, the 
fl ow of materials among the major hubs is very high. Each constituent of the system evolves in a 
manner that maximizes the effi  ciency with which the system utilizes materials and energy.
It is convenient to consider the primary materials producers  and the energy generators together 
because both materials and energy are required in order for the industrial ecosystem to operate. The 
primary materials producer or producers may consist of one or several enterprises devoted to pro-
viding the basic materials that sustain the industrial ecosystem. Most generally, in any realistic 
industrial ecosystem, a signifi  cant fraction of the material processed by the system consists of virgin 
materials. In a number of cases, and increasingly so as pressures build to recycle materials, signifi  -
cant amounts of the materials come from recycling sources.
The processes that virgin materials entering the system are subjected to vary with the kind of 
material, but can generally be divided into several major steps. Typically, the fi  rst step is extraction, 
designed to remove the desired substance as completely as possible from the other substances with Materials

which it occurs. This stage of materials processing can produce large quantities of waste material 
requiring disposal, as is the case with some metal ores in which the metal makes up a small percent-
age of the ore that is mined. In other cases, such as corn grain providing the basis of a corn products 
industry, the “waste,”—in this specifi  c example the cornstalks associated with the grain—can be 
left on the soil to add humus and improve soil quality. A concentration step may follow extraction 
to put the desired material into a purer form. After concentration, the material may be put through 
additional refi  ning steps including separations. Following these steps, the material is usually sub-
jected to additional processing and preparation leading to the fi  nished materials. Throughout the 
various steps of extraction, concentration, separation, refi  ning, processing, preparation, and fi  nish-
ing, various physical and chemical operations are used, and wastes requiring disposal may be 
 produced. Recycled materials may be introduced at various parts of the process, although they are 
usually introduced into the system following the concentration step. 
The extraction and preparation of energy sources can follow many of the steps outlined above 
for the extraction and preparation of materials. For example, the processes involved in extracting 
uranium from ore, enriching it in the fi  ssionable uranium-235 isotope, and casting it into fuel rods 
for nuclear fi  ssion power production include all of those outlined above for materials. On the other 
hand, some rich sources of coal are essentially scooped from a coal seam and sent to a power plant 
for power generation with only minimal processing, such as sorting and grinding.
Recycled materials added to the system at the primary materials and energy production phase 
may be from both pre and postconsumer sources. As examples, recycled paper may be macerated 
and added at the pulping stage of paper manufacture. Recycled aluminum may be added at the mol-
ten metal stage of aluminum metal production.
Finished materials from primary materials producers are fabricated to make products in the 
materials processing and manufacturing sector , which is often a very complex system. For exam-
ple, the manufacture of an automobile requires steel for the frame, plastic for various components, 
rubber in tires, lead in the battery, and copper in the wiring, along with a large number of other 
materials. Typically, the fi  rst step in materials manufacturing and processing is a forming operation. 
For example, sheet steel suitable for making automobile frames may be cut, pressed, and welded 
into the confi  gurati on needed to make a frame . At this step some w astes ma y be produced that 
require disposal. An example of such wastes consists of carbon fi  ber/epoxy composites left over 
from forming parts such as jet aircraft engine housings. Finished components from the forming step 
are fabricated into fi  nished products that are ready for the consumer market.
The materials processing and manufacturing sector presents several opportunities for recycling. 
At this point it may be useful to defi  ne two different streams of recycled materials:
Process recycle streams•  consisting of materials recycled in the manufacturing operation 
itself
External recycle streams•  consisting of materials recycled from other manufacturers or 
from postconsumer products
Materials suitable for recycling can vary signifi  cantly. Generally, materials from the process recy-
cle streams are most suitable for recycling because they are the same materials used in the manufac-
turing operation. Recycled materials from the outside, especially those from postconsumer sources, 
may vary greatly in their characteristics because of the lack of effective controls over recycled post-
consumer materials. Therefore, manufacturers may be reluctant to use such substances.
In the consumer sector , products are sold or leased to the consumers who use them. The duration 
and intensity of use vary widely with the product; paper towels are used only once, whereas an 
automobile may be used thousands of times over many years. In all cases, however, the end of the 
useful lifetime of the product is reached and it is either (1) discarded or (2) recycled. The success 
of a total industrial ecology system may be measured largely by the degree to which recycling 
 predominates over disposal.474 Environmental Chemistry
Recycling has become so widely practiced that an entirely separate waste processing sector  of an 
economic system may now be defi  ned. This sector consists of enterprises that deal specifi  cally with 
the collection, separation, and processing of recyclable materials and their distribution to end-users. 
Such operations may be entirely private or they may involve cooperative efforts with governmental 
sectors. They are often driven by laws and regulations that provide penalties against simply discarding 
used items and materials, as well as positive economic and regulatory incentives for their recycle.
17.13 INDUSTRIAL METABOLISM
Industrial metabolism  refers to the processes to which materials and components are subjected in 
industrial ecosystems. It is analogous to the metabolic processes that occur with food and nutrients 
in biological systems. Like biological metabolism, industrial metabolism may be addressed at sev-
eral levels. A level of industrial metabolism at which green chemistry, especially, comes into play is 
at the molecular level where substances are changed chemically to give desired materials or to gen-
erate energy. Industrial metabolism can be addressed within individual unit processes in a factory, 
at the factory level, at the industrial ecosystem level, and even globally.
A signifi  cant difference between industrial metabolism as it is now practiced and natural meta-
bolic processes relates to the wastes that these systems generate. Natural ecosystems have developed 
such that true wastes are virtually nonexistent. For example, even those parts of plants that remain 
after biodegradation of plant materials form soil humus (see Chapter 16) that improves the condi-
tions of soil on which plants grow. Anthropogenic industrial systems, however, have developed in 
ways that generate large quantities of wastes, where a waste may be defi  ned as dissipative use of 
natural resources . Furthermore, human use of materials has a tendency to dilute and dissipate mate-
rials and disperse them to the environment. Materials may end up in a physical or chemical form 
from which reclamation becomes impractical because of the energy and effort required. A success-
ful industrial ecosystem overcomes such tendencies.
Organisms performing their metabolic processes degrade materials to extract energy (catabo-
lism) and synthesize new substances (anabolism). Industrial ecosystems perform analogous func-
tions. The objective of industrial metabolism in a successful industrial ecosystem is to make desired 
goods with the least amount of by-product and waste. This can pose a signifi  cant challenge. For 
example, to produce lead from lead ore for automobile batteries requires mining large quantities of 
ore, extracting the relatively small fraction of the ore consisting of lead sulfi  de mineral, and roasting 
and reducing the mineral to get lead metal. The whole process generates large quantities of lead-
c o n tami n a t e d  tai li n g s  l e ft  o v e r  fr o m  mi n e r al  e x tr a c t i o n  an d  s i g ni fi  cant quantities of by-product 
sulfur dioxide, which must be reclaimed to make sulfuric acid and not released to the environment. 
The recycling pathway, by way of contrast, takes essentially pure lead from recycled batteries and 
simply melts it down to produce lead for new batteries; the advantages of recycling in this case are 
obvious. Industrial metabolic processes that emphasize recycling are desirable because recycling 
gives essentially constant reservoirs of materials in the recycling loop.
Living organisms have elaborate systems of control. Considering the metabolism that occurs in 
an entire natural ecosystem, it is seen to be self-regulating . If herbivores that consume plant biomass 
become too abundant and diminish the stock of the biomass, their numbers cannot be sustained, the 
population dies back, and their food source rebounds. The most successful ecosystems are those in 
which this self-regulating mechanism operates continuously without wide variations in populations. 
Industrial systems do not inherently operate in a self-regulating manner that is advantageous to their 
surroundings, or even to themselves in the long run. Examples of the failure of self-regulation of 
industrial systems abound in which enterprises have wastefully produced large quantities of goods 
of marginal value, running through limited resources in a short time, and dissipating materials to 
their surroundings, polluting the environment in the process. Despite these bad experiences, within 
a proper framework of laws and regulations designed to avoid wastes and excess, industrial ecosys-
tems can be designed to operate in a self-regulating manner. Such self-regulation operates best Green Chemistry and Industrial Ecology 475
under conditions of maximum recycling in which the system is not dependent on a depleting resource 
of raw materials or energy.
17.14 MATERIALS FLOW AND RECYCLING IN AN INDUSTRIAL ECOSYSTEM
In an industrial ecosystem, there are several points at which materials may be recycled and there are 
several points at which wastes are produced. The potential for the greatest production of waste lies 
in the earlier stages of the cycle in which large quantities of materials with essentially no use associ-
ated with the raw material, such as ore tailings, may require disposal. In many cases, little if any-
thing of value can be obtained from such wastes and the best thing to do with them is to return them 
to their source (usually a mine), if possible. Another big source of potential wastes, and often the one 
that causes the most problems, consists of postconsumer wastes generated when a product’s life 
cycle is fi  nished. With a properly designed industrial ecology cycle, such wastes can be minimized 
and, ideally, totally eliminated.
In general, the amount of waste per unit output decreases in going through the industrial ecology 
cycle from virgin raw material to fi  nal consumer product. Also, the amount of energy expended in deal-
ing with waste or in recycling decreases farther into the cycle. For example, waste iron from the milling 
and forming of automobile parts may be recycled from a manufacturer to the primary producer of iron 
as scrap steel. In order to be used, such steel must be remelted and run through the steel manufacturing 
process again, with a considerable consumption of energy. However, a postconsumer item, such as an 
engine block, may be refurbished and recycled to the market with relatively less expenditure of energy.
17.15 THE KALUNDBORG INDUSTRIAL ECOSYSTEM
The most often cited example of a functional industrial ecosystem is that of Kalundborg, Denmark.

degree, the Kalundborg system developed spontaneously, without being specifi  cally planned as an 
industrial ecosystem. It is based on two major energy suppliers, the 1500-MW ASNAES coal-fi  red 
electrical power plant and the 4–5 million ton/yr Statoil petroleum refi  ning complex, each the larg-
est of its kind in Denmark. The electric power plant sells process steam to the oil refi  nery, from 
which it receives fuel gas and cooling water. Sulfur removed from the petroleum goes to the Kemira 
sulfuric acid plant. By-product heat from the two energy generators is used for district heating of 
homes and commercial establishments, as well as to heat greenhouses and a fi  sh farming opera-
tion. Steam from the electrical power plant is used by the $2 billion/yr Novo Nordisk pharmaceuti-
cal plant, a fi  rm that produces industrial enzymes and 40% of the world’s supply of insulin. This 
plant generates a biological sludge that is used by area farms for fertilizer, applied both as a liquid 
sludge and in a dried form. Calcium sulfate produced as a by-product of sulfur removal by lime 
scrubbing from the electrical plant is used by the Gyproc company to make wallboard. The wall-
board manufacturer also uses clean-burning gas from the petroleum refi  nery as fuel. Fly ash gener-
ated from coal combustion goes into cement and roadbed fi  ll. Lake Tisso serves as a freshwater 
source. Other examples of effi  cient materials utilization associated with Kalundborg include use of 
sludge from the plant that treats water and wastes from the fi  sh farm’s processing plant for ferti-
lizer, and blending of excess yeast from Novo Nordisk’s insulin production as a supplement to 
swine feed.
The development of the Kalundborg complex occurred over a long period of time, beginning in 
the 1960s, and provides some guidelines for the way in which an industrial ecosystem can evolve 
naturally. The fi  rst of many synergistic (mutually advantageous) arrangements was cogeneration of 
usable steam along with electricity by the ASNAES electrical power plant. The steam was fi  rst sold 
to the Statoil petroleum refi  nery, then, as the advantages of large-scale, centralized production of 
steam became apparent, steam was also provided to homes, greenhouses, the pharmaceutical plant, 
and the fi  sh farm. The need to produce electricity more cleanly than was possible simply by burning 
high-sulfur coal resulted in two more synergies. Operation of a lime-scrubbing unit for sulfur 
removal on the power plant stack produced large quantities of calcium sulfate, which found a market 
in the manufacture of gypsum wallboard. It was also found that a clean-burning gas by-product of 
the petroleum refi  ning operation could be substituted in part for the coal burned in the power plant, 
further reducing pollution.
The implementation of the Kalundborg ecosystem occurred largely because of the close personal 
contact among the managers of the various facilities in a relatively close social and professional 
network over a long period of time. All the contracts have been based on sound business fundamen-
tals and have been bilateral. Each company has acted upon its perceived self-interest, and there has 
been no master plan for the system as a whole. The regulatory agencies have been cooperative, but 
not coercive in promoting the system. The industries involved in the agreements have fi  t well, with 
the needs of one matching the capabilities of the other in each of the bilateral agreements. The 
physical distances involved have been small and manageable; it is not economically feasible to ship 
commodities such as steam or fertilizer sludges for long distances. 
17.16  CONSIDERATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS IN 
INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY
By its nature, industrial production has an impact upon the environment. Whenever raw materials 
are extracted, processed, used, and eventually discarded, some environmental impacts will occur. 
In designing an industrial ecological system, several major kinds of environmental impacts must be 
considered in order to minimize them and keep them within acceptable limits. These impacts and 
the measures taken to alleviate them are discussed below. 
For most industrial processes, the fi  rst environmental impact is that of extracting raw materials. 
This can be a straightforward case of mineral extraction, or it can be less direct, such as utilization 
of biomass grown on forest or cropland. A basic decision, therefore, is the choice of the kind of Green Chemistry and Industrial Ecology 477
material to be used. Wherever possible, materials should be chosen that are not likely to be in short 
supply in the foreseeable future. As an example, the silica used to make the lines employed for fi  ber-
optics communication is in unlimited supply and a much better choice for communication conduits 
than copper wire made from limited resources of copper ore.
Industrial ecology systems should be designed to reduce or even totally eliminate air pollutant 
emissions. Among the most notable recent progress in that area has been the marked reduction and 
even total elimination of solvent vapor emissions (volatile organic carbon, VOC), particularly those 
from organochlorine solvents. Some progress in this area has been made with more effective trap-
ping of solvent vapors. In other cases, the use of the solvents has been totally eliminated. This is the 
case for CFCs, which are no longer used in plastic foam blowing and parts cleaning because of their 
potential to affect stratospheric ozone. Other air pollutant emissions that should be eliminated are 
hydrocarbon vapors, including those of methane, CH4, and oxides of nitrogen or sulfur.
D i s c h a r g e s  o f  w a t e r  p o l l u t a n t s  s h o u l d  b e  e n t i r e l y  e l i m i n a t e d  w h e r e v e r  p o s s i b l e .  F o r  m a n y  
decades, effi  cient and effective water treatment systems have been employed that minimize water 
pollution. However, these are “end-of-pipe” measures, and it is much more desirable to design indus-
trial systems such that potential water pollutants are not even generated.
Industrial ecology systems should be designed to prevent production of liquid wastes that may 
have to be sent to a waste processor. Such wastes fall into the two broad categories of water-based 
wastes and those contained in organic liquids. Under current conditions the largest single constitu-
ent of so-called “hazardous wastes” is water. Elimination of water from the waste stream automati-
cally prevents pollution and reduces amounts of wastes requiring disposal. The solvents in organic 
wastes largely represent potentially recyclable or combustible constituents. A properly designed 
industrial ecosystem does not allow such wastes to be generated or to leave the factory site.
In addition to liquid wastes, many solid wastes must be considered in an industrial ecosystem. 
The most troublesome are toxic solids that must be placed in a secure hazardous waste landfi  ll. The 
problem has become especially acute in some industrialized nations in which the availability of 
landfi  ll space is severely limited. In a general sense, solid wastes are simply resources that have not 
been properly utilized. Closer cooperation among suppliers, manufacturers, consumers, regulators, 
and recyclers can minimize quantities and hazards of solid wastes.
Whenever energy is expended, there is a degree of environmental damage. Therefore, energy 
effi ciency must have a high priority in a properly designed industrial ecosystem. Signifi  cant prog-
ress has been made in this area in recent decades, as much because of the high costs of energy as for 
environmental improvement. More effi  cient devices, such as high-effi  ciency electric motors, and 
approaches, such as cogeneration of electricity and heat, that make the best possible use of energy 
resources are highly favored. An important side benefi  t of more effi  cient energy utilization is the 
lowered emissions of air pollutants, including greenhouse gases.
17.17 LIFE CYCLES: EXPANDING AND CLOSING THE MATERIALS LOOP
In a general sense, the traditional view of product utilization is the one-way process of extraction 
Æ production Æ consumption Æ disposal shown in the upper portion of Figure 17.10. Materials 
that are extracted and refi  ned are incorporated into the production of useful items, usually by pro-
cesses that produce large quantities of waste by-products. After the products are worn out, they 
are discarded. This essentially one-way path results in a relatively large exploitation of resources, 
such as metal ores, and a constant accumulation of wastes. As shown at the bottom of Figure 
17.10, however, the one-way path outlined above can become a cycle in which manufactured 
goods are used, and then recycled at the end of their life spans. As one aspect of such a cyclic 
system, it is often useful for manufacturers to assume responsibility for their products, to maintain 
“stewardship.” Ideally, in such a system a product and/or the material in it would have a never-
ending life cycle; when its useful lifetime is exhausted, it is either refurbished or converted into 
another product.478 Environmental Chemistry
From the discussion above and in the rest of this chapter, it may be concluded that industrial ecol-
ogy is all about cyclization of materials . This approach is summarized in a statement attributed to 
Kumar Patel of the University of California at Los Angles, “The goal is cradle to reincarnation , 
since if one is practicing industrial ecology correctly there is no grave.” For the practice of industrial 
ecology to be as effi  cient as possible, cyclization of materials should occur at the highest possible 
level of material purity and stage of product development as discussed under embedded utility  
below.
In considering life cycles, it is important to note that commerce can be divided into the two broad 
categories of products  and services . Although most commercial activity used to be concentrated on 
providing large quantities of goods and products, demand has been largely satisfi  ed for some seg-
ments of the population, and the wealthier economies are moving more to a service-based system. 
Much of the commerce required for a modern society consists of a mixture of services and goods. 
The trend toward a service economy offers two major advantages with respect to waste minimiza-
tion. Obviously, a pure service involves little material. Secondly, a service provider is in a much 
better position to control materials to ensure that they are recycled and to control wastes, ensuring 
their proper disposal. A commonly cited example is that of photocopy machines. They provide a 
service, and a heavily used copy machine requires frequent maintenance and cleaning. The parts of 
such a machine and the consumables, such as toner cartridges, consist of materials that eventually 
will have to be discarded or recycled. In this case it is often reasonable for the provider to lease the 
machine to users, taking responsibility for its maintenance and ultimate fate. The idea could even 
be expanded to include recycling of the paper processed by the copier, with the provider taking 
responsibility for recyclable paper printed by the machine.
In many cases, to be practical, recycling must be practiced on a larger scale than simply that of a 
single industry or product. For example, recycling plastics used in soft drink bottles to make new 
soft drink bottles is not allowed because of the possibilities for contamination. However, the plastics 
can be used as raw material for auto parts. Usually, different companies are involved in making auto 
parts and soft drink bottles.

large quantities of wastes (top). In an ideal industrial ecosystem (bottom), the loop is closed and spent products 
are recycled to the production phase.Green Chemistry and Industrial Ecology 479
17.17.1 P RODUCT  STEWARDSHIP
The degree to which products are recycled is strongly affected by the custody of the products. For 
example, batteries containing cadmium or mercury pose signifi  cant pollution problems when they 
are purchased by the public; used in a variety of devices, such as calculators and cameras; then 
discarded through a number of channels, including municipal refuse. However, when such batteries 
are used within a single organization, it is possible to ensure that almost all of them are returned for 
recycling. In cases such as this, systems of stewardship can be devised in which marketers and 
manufacturers exercise a high degree of control of the product. This can be done through several 
means. One is for the manufacturer to retain ownership of the product, as is commonly practiced 
with photocopy machines. Another mechanism is one in which a signifi  cant part of the purchase 
price is refunded for trade-in of a spent item. This approach could work very well with batteries 
containing cadmium or mercury. The normal purchase price could be doubled, then discounted to 
half with the trade-in of a spent battery.
17.17.2 E MBEDDED  UTILITY
Figure 17.11 can be regarded as an “energy/materials pyramid” showing that the amounts of 
energy and materials involved decrease going from the raw material to the fi  nished product. The 
implication of this diagram is that signifi  cantly less energy, and certainly no more materials, are 
involved when recycling is performed near the top of the materials fl  ow chain rather than near the 
bottom.
In low-level recycling, a material or component is taken back to near the beginning of the 
steps through which it is made. For example, an automobile engine block might be melted down 
to produce molten metal from which new blocks are then cast. With high-level recycling, the item 
or material is recy cled as close to the fi  nal product as possible. In the case of the automobile 
engine block, it may be cleaned, the cylinder walls rehoned, the fl  at surfaces replaned, and the 
block used as the platform for assembling a rebuilt engine. In this example and many others that 
can be cited, high-level recycling uses much less energy and materials and is inherently more 
effi cient.
The greater usability and lower energy requirements for recycling products higher in the order 
of material fl  ow are called embedded utility . One of the major objectives of a system of industrial

when recycling is done near the end of the fl  ow chain, thus retaining embedded utility.480 Environmental Chemistry
ecology and, therefore, one of the main reasons for performing life-cycle assessments is to retain 
the embedded utility in products by measures such as recycling as near to the end of the material 
fl ow as possible, and replacing only those components of systems that are worn out or obsolete. An 
example of the latter occurred during the 1960s when effi  cient and highly reliable turboprop 
engines were retrofi  tted to still serviceable commercial aircraft airframes to replace relatively 
complex piston engines, thus extending the lifetime of the aircraft by a decade or more. 
17.18 LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT
From the beginning, industrial ecology must consider process/product design in the management of 
materials, including the ultimate fates of materials when they are discarded. The product and mate-
rials in it should be subjected to an entire life-cycle assessment  or analysis. A life-cycle assessment 
applies to products, processes, and services through their entire life cycles from extraction of raw 
materials—through manufacturing, distribution, and use—to their fi  nal fates from the viewpoint of 
determining, quantifying, and ultimately minimizing their environmental impacts. It takes account 
of manufacturing, distribution, use, recycling, and disposal. Life-cycle assessment is particularly 
benefi  cial in determining the relative environmental merits of alternative products and services. At 
the consumer level, this could consist of an evaluation of paper versus styrofoam drinking cups. On 
an industrial scale, life-cycle assessment could involve evaluation of nuclear versus fossil-energy-
based electrical power plants. 
A basic step in life-cycle analysis is inventory analysis , which provides qualitative and quantita-
tive information regarding consumption of material and energy resources (at the beginning of the 
cycle) and releases to the anthrosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, and atmosphere (during or at the 
end of the cycle). It is based on various materials cycles and budgets, and it quantifi  es materials and 
energy required as input and the benefi  ts and liabilities posed by products. The related area of 
impact analysis  provides information about the kind and degree of environmental impacts resulting 
from a complete life cycle of a product or activity. Once the environmental and resource impacts 
have been evaluated, it is possible to do an improvement analysis  to determine measures that can be 
taken to reduce impacts on the environment or resources. 
In making a life-cycle analysis the following must be considered:
If there is a choice, selection of the kinds of materials that will minimize waste• 
Kinds of materials that can be reused or recycled• 
Components that can be recycled• 
Alternate pathways for the manufacturing process or for various parts of it• 
Although a complete life-cycle analysis is expensive and time consuming, it can yield signifi  cant 
returns in lowering environmental impacts, conserving resources, and reducing costs. This is espe-
cially true if the analysis is performed at an early stage in the development of a product or service. 
Improved computerized techniques are making signifi  cant advances in the ease and effi  cacy of life-
cycle analyses. Until now, life-cycle assessments have been largely confi  ned to simple materials and 
products such as reusable cloth versus disposable paper diapers. A major challenge now is to expand 
these efforts to more complex products and systems such as aircraft or electronics products.
17.18.1 S COPING  IN LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT
A crucial early step in life-cycle assessment is scoping  the process by determining the boundaries 
of time, space, materials, processes, and products to be considered. Consider as an e xample the 
manufacture of parts that are rinsed with an organochloride solvent in which some solvent is lost by 
evaporation to the atmosphere, by staying on the parts, during the distillation and purifi  cation pro-
cess by which the solvent is made suitable for recycling, and by disposal of waste solvent that cannot Green Chemistry and Industrial Ecology 481
be repurifi  ed. The scope of the life-cycle assessment could be made very narrow by confi  ning it to 
the process as it exists. An assessment could be made of the solvent losses, the impacts of these 
losses, and means for reducing the losses, such as reducing solvent emissions to the atmosphere by 
installation of activated carbon air fi  lters or reducing losses during purifi  cation by employing more 
effi cient distillation processes. A more broadly scoped life-cycle assessment would be to consider 
alternatives to the organochloride solvent. An even broader scope would consider whether the parts 
even need to be manufactured; Are there alternatives to their use?
17.19 CONSUMABLE, RECYCLABLE, AND SERVICE (DURABLE) PRODUCTS
In industrial ecology, most treatments of life-cycle analysis make the distinction between consumable 
products , which are essentially used up and dispersed to the environment during their life cycle and 
service or durable products , which essentially remain in their original form after use. Gasoline is 
clearly a consumable product, whereas the automobile in which it is burned is a service product. It is 
useful, however, to defi  ne a third category of products that clearly become “worn out” when employed 
for their intended purpose, but which remain largely undispersed to the environment. The motor oil 
used in an automobile is such a substance in that most of the original material remains after use. Such 
a category of material may be called a recyclable commodity .
17.19.1 D ESIRABLE  CHARACTERISTICS  OF CONSUMABLES
Consumable products include laundry detergents, hand soaps, cosmetics, windshield washer fl  uids, 
fertilizers, pesticides, laser printer toners, and all other materials that are impossible to reclaim after 
they are used. The environmental implications of the use of consumables are many and profound. 
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, for example, nondegradable surfactants in detergents caused 
severe foaming and esthetic problems at water treatment plants and sewage outfl  ows, and the phos-
phate builders in the detergents promoted excessive algal growth in receiving waters resulting in 
eutrophication (see Chapter 7). Lead in consumable leaded gasoline was widely dispersed to the 
environment when the gasoline was burned. These problems have now been remedied with the 
adoption of phosphate-free detergents with biodegradable surfactants and mandatory use of unleaded 
gasoline.
Since they are destined to be dispersed into the environment, consumables should meet several 
“environmentally friendly” criteria, including the following:
Degradability• : This usually means biodegradability, such as that of household detergent 
constituents that occurs in waste treatment plants and in the environment. Chemical deg-
radation may also occur.
Nonbioaccumulative• : Lipid-soluble, poorly biodegradable substances, such as DDT and 
PCBs, tend to accumulate in organisms and to be magnifi  ed through the food chain. This 
characteristic should be avoided in consumable substances.
Nontoxic• : To the extent possible, consumables should not be toxic in the concentrations 
that organisms are likely to be exposed to them. In addition to their not being acutely toxic, 
consumables should not be mutagenic, carcinogenic, or teratogenic (cause birth defects).
17.19.2 D ESIRABLE  CHARACTERISTICS  OF RECYCLABLES
Recyclables  is used here to describe materials that are not used up in the sense that laundry deter-
gents or photocopier toners are consumed, but are not durable items. In this context, recyclables can 
be understood to be chemical substances and formulations. The HCFCs used as refrigerant fl  uids 
fall into this category , as does ethylene glycol mixed with water in automobile engine antifreeze/
antiboil formulations (although rarely recycled in practice).482 Environmental Chemistry
Insofar as possible, recyclables should be minimally hazardous with respect to toxicity, fl  am-
mability, and other hazards. For example, both volatile hydrocarbon solvents and organochloride 
(chlorinated hydrocarbon) solvents are recyclable after use for parts degreasing and other applica-
tions requiring a good solvent for organic materials. The hydrocarbon solvents have relatively low 
toxicities, but may present fl  ammability hazards during use and reclamation for recycling. The 
organochloride solvents are less fl  ammable, but may pose a greater toxicity hazard. An example 
of such a solvent is carbon tetrachloride, which is so nonfl  ammable that it was once used in 
fi re extinguishers, but the current applications of which are highly constrained because of its 
high toxicity.
An obviously important characteristic of recyclables is that they should be designed and formulated 
to be amenable to recycling. In some cases there is little leeway in formulating potentially recyclable 
materials; motor oil, for example, must meet certain performance criteria, including the ability to 
lubricate, stand up to high temperatures, and other attributes, regardless of its ultimate fate. In other 
cases formulations can be modifi  ed to enhance recyclability. For example, the use of bleachable or 
removable ink in newspapers enhances the recyclability of the newsprint, enabling it to be restored to 
an acceptable level of brightness.
For some commodities, the potential for recycling is enormous. This can be exemplifi  ed by lubri-
cating oils. The volume of motor oil sold in the United States each year for internal combustion 
engines is about 2.5 billion liters, a fi  gure that is doubled if all lubricating oils are considered. A 
particularly important aspect of utilizing recyclables is their collection. In the case of motor oil, 
collection rates are low from consumers who change their own oil, and they are responsible for the 
dispersion of large amounts of waste oil to the environment.
17.19.3 D ESIRABLE  CHARACTERISTICS  OF SERVICE  PRODUCTS
Since, in principle at least, service products are destined for recycling, they have comparatively lower 
constraints on materials and higher constraints on their ultimate disposal. A major impediment to the 
recycling of service products is the lack of convenient channels through which they can be put into 
the recycling loop. Television sets and major appliances such as washing machines or ovens have 
many recyclable components, but often end up in landfi  lls and waste dumps simply because there is 
no handy means for getting them from the user and into the recycling loop. In such cases, government 
intervention may be necessary to provide appropriate channels. One partial remedy to the disposal/
recycling problem consists of leasing arrangements or payment of deposits on items such as batteries 
to ensure their return to a recycler. The terms “de-shopping” or “reverse shopping” describe a process 
by which service commodities would be returned to a location such as a parking lot where they could 
be collected for recycling. According to this scenario, the analogy to a supermarket would be a facil-
ity in which service products are collected and disassembled for recycling.
Much can be done in the design of service products to facilitate their recycle. One of the main 
characteristics of recyclable service products must be ease of disassembly so that remanufacturable 
components and recyclable materials, such as copper wire, can be readily removed and separated for 
recycling.
17.20 DESIGN FOR ENVIRONMENT
Design for environment  is the term given to the approach of designing and engineering products, 
processes, and facilities in a manner that minimizes their adverse environmental impacts and, where 
possible, maximizes their benefi  cial environmental effects. In modern industrial operations, design 
for environment is part of a larger scheme termed “design for X,” where “ X” can be any one of a 
number of characteristics such as assembly, manufacturability, reliability, and serviceability. 
In making such a design, numerous desired characteristics of the product must be considered, 
including ultimate use, properties, costs, and appearance. Design for environment requires that the Green Chemistry and Industrial Ecology 483
designs of the product, the process by which it is made, and the facilities involved in making it con-
form to appropriate environmental goals and limitations imposed by the need to maintain environ-
mental quality. It must also consider the ultimate fate of the product, particularly whether or not it 
can be recycled at the end of its normal life span.
17.20.1 P RODUCTS , PROCESSES , AND FACILITIES
In discussing design for environment, the distinctions among products, processes, and facilities must 
be kept in clear perspective. Products —automobile tires, laundry detergents, and refrigerators—are 
items sold to consumers. Processes  are the means of producing products and services. For example, 
tires are made by a process in which hydrocarbon monomers are polymerized to produce rubber that 
is molded in the shape of a tire with a carcass reinforced by synthetic fi  bers and steel wires. A facility  
is where processes are carried out to produce or deliver products or services. In cases where services 
are regarded as products, the distinction between products and processes becomes blurred. For exam-
ple, a lawn care service delivers products in the forms of fertilizers, pesticides, and grass seeds, but 
also delivers pure services including mowing, edging, and sod aeration.
Although products  tend to get the most public attention in consideration of environmental matters, 
processes  often have more environmental impact. Successful process designs tend to stay in service 
for many years and to be used to make a wide range of products. While the product of a process may 
have minimal environmental impact, the process by which the product is made may have marked 
environmental effects. An example is the manufacture of paper. The environmental impact of paper 
as a product, even when improperly discarded, is not terribly great, whereas the process by which it 
is made involves harvesting wood from forests, high use of water, potential emission of a wide range 
of air pollutants, and other factors with profound environmental implications.
Processes develop symbiotic relationships when one provides a product or service utilized in 
another. An example of such a relationship is that between steel making and the process for the 
production of oxygen required in the basic oxygen process by which carbon and silicon impurities 
are oxidized from molten iron to produce steel. The long lifetimes and widespread applicability of 
popular processes make their design for environment of utmost importance.
The nature of a properly functioning system of industrial ecology is such that processes are even 
more interwoven than would otherwise be the case, because by-products from some processes are 
used by other processes. Therefore, the processes employed in such a system and the interrelation-
ships and interdependencies among them are particularly important. A major change in one process 
may have a “domino effect” on the others.
17.20.2 K EY FACTORS  IN DESIGN FOR ENVIRONMENT
Two key choices that must be made in design for environment are those involving materials and 
energy. The choices of materials in an automobile illustrate some of the possible trade-offs. Steel as 
a component of automobile bodies requires relatively large amounts of energy and involves signifi  -
cant environmental disruption in the mining and processing of iron ore. Steel is a relatively heavy 
material, so more energy is involved in moving automobiles made of steel. However, steel is durable, 
has a high rate of recycling, and is produced initially from abundant sources of iron ore. Aluminum 
is much lighter than steel and quite durable. It is one of the most commonly recycled commodities. 
Good primary sources of aluminum, bauxite ores, are not as abundant as iron ores, and large 
amounts of energy are required in the primary production of aluminum. Plastics are another source 
of automotive components. The light weight of plastic reduces automotive fuel consumption, plas-
tics with desired properties are readily made, and molding and shaping plastic parts is a straight-
forward process. However, plastic automobile components have a low rate of recycling.
Three related characteristics of a product that should be considered in design for environment are 
durability, repairability, and recyclability. Durability  simply refers to how well the product lasts and 484 Environmental Chemistry
resists breakdown in normal use. Some products are notable for their durability; ancient two- cylinder 
John Deere farm tractors from the 1930s and 1940s are legendary in farming circles for their dura-
bility, enhanced by the affection engendered in their owners who tend to preserve them. Repairability  
is a measure of how easy and inexpensive it is to repair a product. A product that can be repaired is 
less likely to be discarded when it ceases to function for some reason. Recyclability  refers to the 
degree and ease with which a product or components of it may be recycled. An important aspect of 
recyclability is the ease with which a product can be disassembled into constituents consisting of a 
single material that can be recycled. It also considers whether the components are made of materials 
that can be recycled.
17.20.3 H AZARDOUS  MATERIALS  IN DESIGN FOR ENVIRONMENT
A key consideration in the practice of design for environment is the reduction of the dispersal of 
hazardous materials and pollutants. This can entail the reduction or elimination of hazardous materi-
als in manufacture, an example of which was the replacement of stratospheric ozone-depleting CFCs 
in foam blowing of plastics. If appropriate substitutes can be found, somewhat toxic and persistent 
chlorinated solvents should not be used in manufacturing applications such as parts washing. The 
use of hazardous materials in the product—such as batteries containing toxic cadmium, mercury, 
and lead—should be eliminated or minimized. Pigments containing heavy metal cadmium or lead 
should not be used if there are any possible substitutes. The substitution of HCFCs and hydrofl  uoro-
carbons for ozone-depleting CFCs in products (refrigerators and air conditioners) is an example of 
a major reduction in environmentally damaging materials in products. The elimination of extremely 
persistent PCBs from electrical transformers removed a major hazardous waste problem due to the 
use of a common product.
17.21 INHERENT SAFETY
The use of nitroglycerin in the construction of the Central Pacifi  c Railroad in California during the 
1 860s provides a lesson in safe handling of materials. On April 3, 1 866, 70 crates of California-
bound dangerously explosive nitroglycerin blew up aboard the steamship European being unloaded 
on the Caribbean coast of Panama killing 50 people and causing substantial damage. Only 2 weeks 
later two crates of nitroglycerin, which had been refused delivery because of their condition, 
exploded in an offi  ce of the Wells Fargo Company in San Francisco killing 15 people and causing 
massive destruction, although instantaneously resolving the question regarding what to do with the 
damaged goods. Only 2 days later six workers on the Central Pacifi  c Railroad in the Sierra Nevada 
mountains were killed by an explosion of nitroglycerin that was being used in place of much less 
effective black gunpowder, for blasting on the railroad construction. As a consequence of these 
accidents, California legislators quickly passed legislation forbidding the transportation of nitro-
glycerin through San Francisco and Sacramento.
It appeared that the measures taken by the California authorities would prevent the use of the 
powerfully explosive nitroglycerin in the construction of the Central Pacifi  c causing a huge delay of 
the project. However, James Howden, a British chemist, won contracts to make nitroglycerin on site 
for the massive Central Pacifi  c construction project and he produced up to 100 lbs per day of the 
explosive as needed with no further injuries resulting from accidental nitroglycerin explosions. This 
was an early example of safe handling of material. The glycerin and sulfuric and nitric acids needed 
to make nitroglycerin could be transported to the site in relative safety and with no explosion haz-
ard. The truly hazardous nitroglycerin was made only as needed so that at no time was there a large 
amount available in one place to cause an explosion. Finally, the nitroglycerin was only transported 
short distances greatly minimizing the possibility of transportation accidents with this notoriously 
sensitive explosive.Green Chemistry and Industrial Ecology 485
A chemical process is said to be inherently safe when permanent measures have been integrated 
into the process to reduce or eliminate specifi  c hazards. Five approaches by which this may be done 
are the following.
 1. Use only minimum quantities of hazardous substances. In the example of nitroglycerin 
discussed above relatively small quantities of the explosive were made at any one time.
 2. Use a less hazardous substance. In 1867 Alfred Nobel invented dynamite, which consisted 
of nitroglycerin absorbed onto a carrier such as sawdust and which was much safer to 
handle than pure nitroglycerin but almost as effective as an explosive. 
 3. Use safer conditions. In a chemical process, this might consist of carrying out reactions at 
lower temperatures and pressures over a catalyst so that if a malfunction occurs, the results 
are much less catastrophic.
 4. Simplify. As a general rule, simpler processes are safer processes. Added steps add possi-
bilities for things to go wrong.
 5. Maximize continuous steady-state operation with continuous processes that avoid problems 
likely to occur during startup and shutdown.
17.21.1 I NCREASED  SAFETY WITH SMALLER  SIZE
Safety can be increased by using “green reactors,”11 often by the simple expedient of down-sizing 
operations and quantities of materials, a strategy of minimization . A common example of minimiza-
tion is the substitution of small continuous fl  ow reactors for large batch processes (Figure 17.12). In 
scaling up from batch laboratory processes to commercial production, large batch reactors often 
have been employed. Such a reactor containing large amounts of material can be very problematic 
if something goes wrong, such as an uncontrolled runaway reaction. Such reactors often have been 
used because of slow mixing and heating that required reactants to be in contact for long periods of 
time, whereas the actual reaction is often very quick once the reactants are in contact. It is often 
desirable to substitute a very small loop reactor with effi  cient mixing and rapid energy transfer so 
that the quantities of reactants in the reaction process are very much reduced (Figure 17.12). In such 
a case, only much smaller quantities are involved and if anything goes wrong the amounts of mate-
rial that must be dealt with are much smaller.

17.22 INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
Ecological engineering  seeks to integrate the anthrosphere and its activities with natural ecosys-
tems to mutual advantage. Ecological engineering has many commonalities with industrial ecology. 
Ecological engineering combines systems ecology with engineering. It develops ecotechnologies 
through designing, constructing, and managing systems of natural ecology integrated with the 
anthrosphere.
The greatest success to date from the application of ecological engineering is the construction and 
operation of wetlands to treat wastewater. Constructed wetlands do not necessarily duplicate the liv-
ing species and other aspects of natural wetlands and may even be located in areas where wetlands 
have not previously existed. They do provide the essential ingredients—water, sunlight, nutrients, 
and confi  ned conditions—that enable wetland-based ecosystems to develop and thrive. Other endeav-
ors involving ecological engineering include restoration ecology of areas damaged by development, 
phytoremediation using living plants to remove pollutants from polluted areas, stream restoration, 
and soil bioengineering that uses ecosystems and the plants in them to reduce soil erosion and to 
increase agricultural productivity in a sustainable manner.
The most ambitious project based on ecological engineering to date in the United States is the 
restoration of the Florida Everglades. This huge area is a vast wetland that has been drained and 
damaged by channelization projects carried out by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Now a mas-
sive effort is underway to reverse the damage. The Everglades will never be what they were before 
human intervention, but the successful completion of the project will see the re-establishment of a 
functional wetlands system to the benefi  t of alligators, other wildlife, and eventually humans.

Materials
18.1 WHERE TO GET THE STUFF WE NEED?
One of the greatest challenges facing humankind is posed by the demand for materials that humans 
need (or at least want) to meet their desires for higher material standards of living. The economic 
effects of this demand were illustrated painfully during the approximately 2005–2008 time period 
when demand for materials such as crude oil, aluminum, copper, lead, zinc, phosphate minerals 
(for fertilizer), and other commodities sent prices of these and many other materials soaring. This 
demand was fueled by a number of factors operating throughout the world including the evolving 
economies of highly populated China and India and buying binges of consumers in the United 
States made over-confi  dent by rapidly increasing housing values, increasing prices of stock, and 
easy credit on credit cards. In early 2008, it began to look like the price of crude oil would soar far 
above $150 per barrel, gasoline would surpass $5.00 per gallon in the Unites States (still inexpensive 
by European standards), and grain for food and animal feed would continue to increase beyond 
record levels. The prices of metals had risen such that thieves were raiding unoccupied houses to 
steal aluminum and copper as some other thieves were even cutting catalytic converters from vehi-
cles to get to their precious metal contents. Around mid-2008, a wrenching adjustment occurred as 
i t  b e c am e  o b v i o u s  th a t  s u c h  p ri c e  in c r e a s e s  w e r e  u n s u s tain a b l e ,  p ri c e s  o f  c o mm o di ti e s  s u c h  a s  
crude oil dropped drastically, and home prices in the United States fell dramatically as countries 
throughout much of the world experienced the worst economic downturn (a very big recession or a 
mini-depression) since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
These events clearly illustrate the importance of materials for modern societies. The acquisi-
tion, utilization, and disposal of materials have enormous environmental consequences. Earth 
 simply cannot support the current trajectory of material use. This is especially so as countries with 
large and growing populations aspire to the standard of living enjoyed by modern industrialized 
countries such as the United States, Canada, and Australia. Calculations of how many “Earths” 
would be required to satisfy material demands if all the world’s people enjoyed a U.S. standard of 
living have shown that perhaps as many as 10 planets such as ours would be needed. It is obvious 
that materials are of the utmost importance in sustainability. This chapter is devoted to materials 
and the resources from which they are acquired. Energy is a resource of particular importance, so 
Chapter 19, “Sustainable Energy: The Key to Everything,” is devoted to the topic of energy.
The materials needed for modern societies can be provided from either extractive (nonre-
newable) or renewable sources. Extractive industries remove irreplaceable mineral resources 
from the earth’s crust. The utilization of mineral resources is strongly tied with technology, 
energy, and the environment. Perturbations in one usually cause perturbations in the others. 
For example, reductions in automotive exhaust pollutant levels to curtail air pollution have 
required use of catalytic devices that contain platinum-group metals, a valuable and irreplace-
able natural resource. Implementation of the best practices of industrial ecology and green 492 Environmental Chemistry
chemistry will be required to improve environmental quality with reduced consumption of 
nonrenewable material resources.
In discussing nonrenewable sources of minerals as well as energy, it is useful to defi  ne two terms 
related to available quantities. The fi  rst of these is resources , defi ned as quantities that are estimated 
to be ultimately  available. The second term is reserves , which refers to well-identifi  ed resources that 
can be profi  tably utilized with existing technology.
18.2 MINERALS IN THE GEOSPHERE
There are numerous kinds of mineral deposits that are used in various ways. These are, for the most 
part, sources of metals which occur in batholiths  composed of masses of igneous rock that have been 
extruded in a solid or molten state into the surrounding rock strata. In addition to deposits formed 
directly from solidifying magma, associated deposits are produced by water interacting with magma. 
Hot aqueous solutions associated with magma can form rich hydrothermal  deposits of minerals. Several 
important metals, including lead, zinc, and copper, are often associated with hydrothermal deposits.
Some useful mineral deposits are formed as sedimentary deposits along with the formation of 
sedimentary rocks. Evaporites are produced when seawater is evaporated. Common mineral evapo-
rites are halite (NaCl), sodium carbonates, potassium chloride, gypsum (CaSO4 . 2H2O), and mag-
nesium salts. Many signifi  cant iron deposits consisting of hematite (Fe2O3) and magnetite (Fe3O4) 
were formed as sedimentary bands when earth’s atmosphere was changed from reducing to oxidiz-
ing as photosynthetic organisms produced oxygen, precipitating the oxides from the oxidation of 
soluble Fe2+ ion. 
Deposition of suspended rock solids by fl  owing water can cause segregation of the rocks according 
to differences in size and density. This can result in the formation of useful placer deposits that are 
enriched in desired minerals. Gravel, sand, and some other minerals, such as gold, often occur in 
placer deposits.
Some mineral deposits are formed by the enrichment of desired constituents when other frac-
tions are weathered or leached away. The most common example of such a deposit is bauxite, Al2O3, 
remaining after silicates and other more soluble constituents have been dissolved from aluminum-
rich minerals by the weathering action of water under the severe conditions of hot tropical climates 
with very high levels of rainfall. This kind of material is called a laterite .
18.2.1 E VALUATION  OF MINERAL  RESOURCES
World mineral resources are obviously critical to the well-being of modern civilization. In order to 
make its extraction worthwhile, a mineral must be enriched at a particular location in the earth’s 
crust relative to the average crustal abundance. Normally applied to metals, such an enriched deposit 
is called an ore. The value of an ore is expressed in terms of a concentration factor :
 Concentration factor =   Concentration of material in ore    __________________________    Average crustal concentration   (18.1)
Obviously, higher concentration factors are always desirable. Required concentration factors 
decrease with average crustal concentrations and with the value of the commodity extracted. A 
concentration factor of 4 might be adequate for iron, which makes up a relatively high percentage of 
the earth’s crust. Concentration factors must be several hundred or even several thousand for less 
expensive metals that are not present at very high percentages in the earth’s crust. However, for an 
extremely valuable metal, such as platinum, a relatively low concentration factor is acceptable 
because of the high fi  nancial return obtained from extracting the metal.
Acceptable concentration factors are a sensitive function of the price of a metal. Shifts in price 
can cause signifi  cant CCS (copper/chrome/arsenic). If the price of a metal increases by, for example, 
50%, and the increase appears to be long term, it becomes profi  table to mine deposits that had not Resources and Sustainable Materials 493
been mined previously. The opposite can happen, as is often the case when richer sources are dis-
covered or substitute materials are found.
In addition to large variations in the concentration factors of various ores, there are extremes in 
the geographic distribution of mineral resources. The United States is perhaps about average for all 
nations in terms of its mineral resources, possessing signifi  cant resources of copper, lead, iron, gold, 
and molybdenum, but virtually without resources of some important strategic metals, including 
chromium, tin, and platinum-group metals. For its size and population, South Africa is particularly 
blessed with some important metal mineral resources.
18.3 EXTRACTION AND MINING
Minerals are usually extracted from the earth’s crust by various kinds of mining procedures, but 
other techniques may be employed as well. The raw materials so obtained include inorganic com-
pounds such as phosphate rock, sources of metal such as lead sulfi  de ore, clay used for fi  rebrick, and 
structural materials, such as sand and gravel. 
Surface mining, which can consist of digging large holes in the ground, or strip mining, is used 
to extract minerals that occur near the surface. A common example of surface mining is quarrying 
of rock. Vast areas have been dug up to extract coal. Because of past mining practices, surface min-
ing got a well-deserved bad name. With modern reclamation practices, however, topsoil is fi  rst 
removed and stored. After the mining is complete, the topsoil is spread on top of overburden that 
has been replaced such that the soil surface has gentle slopes and proper drainage. Topsoil spread 
over the top of the replaced spoil, often carefully terraced to prevent erosion, is seeded with indig-
enous grass and other plants, fertilized, and watered, if necessary, to provide vegetation. The end 
result of carefully done mine reclamation projects is a well-vegetated area suitable for wildlife habi-
tat, recreation, forestry, grazing, and other benefi  cial purposes. Such a project can be regarded as an 
application of ecological engineering (see Section 17.22).
Water pollution is often a problem associated with mining. One of the most common problems is the 
formation of acid mine water (H2SO4) from microbial action on pyrite (FeS2) exposed to the atmosphere 
in mining a number of kinds of mineral ores (see Section 6.14). Processes have been developed for the 
treatment of this acid rock drainage, such as those using sulfate-reducing bacteria in bioreactors.1
Extraction of minerals from placer deposits formed by deposition from water has obvious envi-
ronmental implications. Mining of placer deposits can be accomplished by dredging from a boom-
equipped barge. Another means that can be used is hydraulic mining with large streams of water. 
One interesting approach for more coherent deposits is to cut the ore with intense water jets, then 
suck up the resulting small particles with a pumping system. These techniques have a high potential 
to pollute water and disrupt waterways and are environmentally controversial.
For many minerals, underground mining is the only practical means of extraction. An under-
ground mine can be very complex and sophisticated. The structure of the mine depends on the 
nature of the deposit. It is of course necessary to have a shaft that reaches to the ore deposit. 
Horizontal tunnels extend out into the deposit, and provision must be made for sumps to remove 
water and for ventilation. Factors that must be considered in designing an underground mine include 
the depth, shape, and orientation of the ore body, as well as the nature and strength of the rock in 
and around it; thickness of overburden; and depth below the surface.
Usually, signifi  cant amounts of processing are required before a mined product is used or even 
moved from the mine site. Such processing, and the by-products of it, can have signifi  cant environ-
mental eff ects. E v en rock to be used f or aggregate and f or road construction must be crushed and 
sized, a process that has the potential to emit air-polluting dust particles into the atmosphere. Crushing 
is also a necessary fi  rst step for further processing of ore. Some minerals occur to an extent of a few 
percent or even less in the rock taken from the mine and must be concentrated on site so that the resi-
due does not have to be hauled far. These concentration processes along with roasting, extraction, and 
in some cases chemical leaching of the ore are categorized as extractive metallurgy .494 Environmental Chemistry
One of the more environmentally troublesome by-products of mineral refi  ning consists of waste 
tailings . By the nature of the mineral processing operations employed, tailings are usually fi  nely 
divided and, as a result, subject to chemical and biochemical weathering processes. Heavy metals 
associated with metal ores can be leached from tailings, producing water runoff contaminated with 
cadmium, lead, and other pollutants. Adding to the problem are some of the processes used to refi  ne 
ore. Large quantities of cyanide solution are used in some processes to extract low levels of gold 
from ore, posing obvious toxicological hazards.
Environmental problems resulting from exploitation of extractive resources—including distur-
bance of land, air pollution from dust and smelter emissions, and water pollution from disrupted 
aquifers—are aggravated by the fact that the general trend in mining involves utilization of less rich 
ore. This is illustrated in Figure 18.1, showing the average percentage of copper in copper ore mined 
since 1900. The average percentage of copper in ore mined in 1900 was about 4%, but by 1982 it 
was about 0.6% in domestic ore, and 1.4% in richer foreign ore. Ore as low as 0.1% copper may 
eventually be processed. Increased demand for a particular metal, coupled with the necessity to 
utilize lower-grade ore, has a vicious multiplying effect on the amount of ore that must be mined and 
processed and accompanying environmental consequences.2
The proper practice of industrial ecology can be used to signifi  cantly reduce the effects of min-
ing and mining by-products. One way in which this can be done is to entirely eliminate the need 
for mining, utilizing alternate sources of materials. An example of such utilization, widely 
 hypothesized but not yet put into practice to a large extent, is the extraction of aluminum from coal 
ash. This would have the double advantage of minimizing amounts of waste ash and reducing the 
need to mine scarce aluminum ore.
18.4 METALS
The majority of elements are metals, most of which are of crucial importance as resources. The 
availability and annual usage of metals vary widely with the kind of metal. Some metals are abun-
dant and widely used in structural applications; iron and aluminum are prime examples. Other met-
als, especially those of the platinum group (platinum, palladium, iridium, rhodium) are very precious 
and their use is confi  ned to applications such as catalysts, fi  laments, or electrodes for which only 
small quantities are required. Some metals are considered to be “crucial” because of their applica-
tions for which no substitutes are available and shortages or uneven distribution in supply that occur. 
Such a metal is chromium, used to manufacture stainless steel (especially for parts exposed to high 
temperatures and corrosive gases), jet aircraft, automobiles, hospital equipment, and mining 1900Percentage copper

 equipment. The platinum-group metals are used as catalysts in the chemical industry, in petroleum 
refi ning, and in automobile exhaust antipollution devices.
Metals exhibit a wide variety of properties and uses. They come from a number of different 
compounds; in some cases two or more compounds are signifi  cant mineral sources of the same 
metal. Usually these compounds are oxides or sulfi  des. However, other kinds of compounds and, in 
the cases of gold and platinum-group metals, the elemental (native) metals themselves serve as 
metal ore. Table 18.1 lists the important metals, their properties, major uses, and sources.

18.5 METAL RESOURCES AND INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY
Metals come from two sources, the geosphere from which they are mined and the anthrosphere in 
which metals are recycled. In the case of relatively abundant metals that are inexpensive to extract 
from ores and that do not pose major environmental problems in their disposal, the geosphere is the 
major source (iron is such a metal). For metals in limited supply that should never be discarded 
because of adverse environmental effects, recycling predominates; lead is the prime example. The TABLE 18.1 (continued)

current anthrospheric stock of iron in the United States is now estimated at 3200 million metric tons 
such that a system of perfect recycling could entirely eliminate the need to mine additional iron ore.3
Considerations of industrial ecology are very important in extending and effi  ciently utilizing 
metal resources. More than any other kind of resource, metals lend themselves to recycling and to 
the practice of industrial ecology. This section briefl  y addresses the industrial ecology of metals.
18.5.1 A LUMINUM
Aluminum metal has a remarkably wide range of uses resulting from its properties of low density, 
high strength, ready workability, corrosion resistance, and high electrical conductivity. The use and 
disposal of aluminum present no environmental problems and it is one of the most readily recycled 
of all metals.
The environmental problems associated with aluminum result from the mining and processing 
of bauxite aluminum ore, which contains 40–60% alumina, Al2O3, associated with water molecules, 
the result of weathering away of more soluble minerals, particularly in high-rainfall regions of the 
tropics (see laterites in Section 18.2). Strip mining of bauxite from thin seams causes signifi  cant 
disturbance to the geosphere. The commonly used Bayer process for aluminum refi  ning dissolves 
alumina, shown below as the hydroxide Al(OH)3, from bauxite at high temperatures with sodium 
hydroxide as sodium aluminate:
 Al(OH)3 + NaOH Æ NaAlO2 + 2H2O (18.2)
leaving behind large quantities of caustic “red mud.” This residue, which is rich in oxides of iron, 
silicon, and titanium, has virtually no uses and a high potential to produce pollution. Aluminum 
hydroxide is then precipitated in the pure form at lower temperatures and calcined at about 1200 ∞C 
to produce pure anhydrous Al2O3. The anhydrous alumina is electrolyzed in molten cyrolite, 
Na3AlF6, at carbon electrodes to produce aluminum metal. All of these steps are very energy inten-
sive, which makes recycling of aluminum metal particularly desirable.
An interesting possibility that could avoid many of the environmental problems associated with 
aluminum production is the use of coal fl  y ash as a source of the metal. Produced in large quantities as 
a by-product of electricity generation, fl  y ash is essentially free. Its anhydrous nature avoids the expense 
of removing water; it is a fi  nely divided homogeneous material. Aluminum, along with iron, manga-
nese, and titanium, can be extracted from coal fl  y ash with acid. If aluminum is extracted as the chlo-
ride salt, AlCl3, it can be electrolyzed as the chloride by the ALCOA process. Although this process 
has not yet been proven to be competitive with the Bayer process, it may become so in the future.
Gallium is a metal that commonly occurs with aluminum ore and may be produced as a by-
product of aluminum manufacture. Gallium combined with arsenic or with indium and arsenic is 
useful in semiconductor applications, including integrated circuits, photoelectric devices, and lasers. 
Although important, these applications require only miniscule amounts of gallium compared to 
major metals.
18.5.2 C HROMIUM
Chromium is of crucial importance to industrialized societies because of its use in stainless steel 
and superalloys used in jet engines, nuclear power plants, chemical-resistant valves, and other appli-
cations in which a material that resists heat and chemical attack is required. 
As noted in Table 18.1, supplies of chromium are poorly distributed around the world. To conserve 
chromium it is important that it be handled according to good practices of industrial ecology. Several 
measures ma y be taken in this respect. Chromium is almost impossible to reco v er from chrome-
plated objects, and this use should be eliminated insofar as possible, as has been done with much of 
the decorative chrome-plated adornments formerly put on automobiles. Chromium(VI) (chromate) is 498 Environmental Chemistry
a toxic form of the metal and its uses should be eliminated wherever possible. The use of chromium 
in leather tanning and miscellaneous chemical applications should be curtailed. Chromium was once 
widely used in the preparation of treated CCS (copper/chrome/arsenic) lumber, which resists fungal 
decay and termites, but this product is now banned because of its content of toxic arsenic.
18.5.3 C OPPER
Copper is a low-toxicity, corrosion-resistant metal widely used because of its workability (ductility 
and malleability), electrical conductivity, and ability to conduct heat. In addition to its use in electri-
cal wire, where in some applications it is now challenged by aluminum, copper is also used in tub-
ing, copper pipe, shims, gaskets, and other applications.
There are at least two major environmental problems associated with the extraction and refi  ning 
of copper. The fi  rst of these is the dilute form in which copper ore now occurs (see Figure 18.1), such 
that in the United States 150–175 ton of inert material (not counting overburden removed in strip 
mining) must be processed and discarded to produc e a ton of copper metal. The second problem is 
the occurrence of copper as the sulfi  de so that in the production of copper, large amounts of sulfur 
must be recovered as a by-product or, unfortunately in some less developed countries, released into 
the atmosphere as pollutant SO2.
An advantage to copper for recycling is that it is used primarily as the metal, which represents 
“stored energy” in that it does not require energy for reduction to the metal. Recycling rates of scrap 
copper appear low in part because so much of the inventory of copper metal is tied up in long-lasting 
electrical wire, in structures, and other places where the lifetime of the metal is long. (This is in 
contrast to lead, where the main source of recycled metal is storage batteries, which last only 
2–5 years.) An impediment to copper recycling is the diffi  culty of recovering copper components 
from circuits, plumbing, and other applications.
18.5.4 C OBALT
Cobalt is a “strategic” metal with very important applications in alloys, particularly in heat-resistant 
applications, such as jet engines. The major source of cobalt is as a by-product of copper refi  ning, 
although it can also be obtained as a by-product of nickel and lead. As much as 50% of the cobalt in 
these sources is lost to tailings, slag, or other wastes, so there is a signifi  cant potential to improve 
the recovery of cobalt. Relatively low percentages of cobalt are recycled as scrap.
18.5.5 L EAD
The industrial ecology of lead is very important because of the widespread use of this metal and its 
toxicity. Global fl  uxes of lead from the anthrosphere are shown in Figure 18.2.
Somewhat more than half of the lead processed by humans comes from the geosphere, mostly as 
lead ore, with the remainder coming from recycled lead. By far the greatest use of lead is in batter-
ies, and the amount of battery lead recycled each year approaches that taken from the geosphere. A 
small fraction of lead is dissipated as wastes associated with mining, refi  ning, and use of the metal. 
Former uses of lead other than in batteries, including pigments, solder, cable sheathing, formed 
products, and shot in ammunition, have been severely curtailed; recycling lead from such applica-
tions is diffi  cult. Although much of the lead in batteries is recycled,4 about one-third of it is lost and 
this represents another area of potential improvement in the utilization of lead.
18.5.6 L ITHIUM
Lithium , atomic number 3, atomic mass 6.94 1 , is emerging as a metal of particular importance 
with respect to energy sustainability. It is the fi  rst metal in the periodic table and the lightest with Resources and Sustainable Materials 499
a density in the metallic form of only 0.531 g/cm3. Until recently, the demand for lithium was 
 relatively low with uses in glasses, enamels, specialty ceramics, lubricant greases, and as a phar-
maceutical agent to treat some mental disorders. Lithium forms the Li+ ion which, because of its 
low mass, is a very effi  cient charge carrier in powerful, compact lithium ion batteries, which oper-
ate by means of the movement of Li+ ions between electrodes through an electrolyte and across a 
separator. Because of their abilities to store large amounts of electrical energy in relatively small 
r ec h ar g ea b l e  b a tte ri e s ,  th e s e  d e vi ce s  h a v e  bec o m e  v e ry  po p ul ar  in  po rta b l e  e l ec tr o ni c  d e vi ce s ,  
especially laptop computers.
Although the popularity of lithium ion batteries in portable electronic devices has increased 
the demand for lithium, it is miniscule compared to the demand that will be created for this metal 
as lithium ion batteries are developed for use in electric and especially hybrid vehicles that have 
both electric motors and internal combustion engines. Known world resources of lithium are 
limited. As of 2009, these were estimated at 5.4 million tons in Bolivia, 3 million in Chile, 1.1 
million in China, and 410,000 in the United States. The harvesting of lithium salts from the fl  at-
salt desert of Uyuni in Bolivia has become an important source of income for the local people 
although meeting projected demand will require larger mechanized operations. The limited num-
ber of locations of known lithium deposits and political uncertainties regarding these sources 
have raised concerns regarding acquisition of suffi  cient supplies of this metal to meet projected 
demands. However, it is likely that there are signifi  cant lithium resources in various parts of the 
world that have not been found, largely because they have not been sought in the past due to lim-
ited demand for this element.
18.5.7 P OTASSIUM
Potassium deserves special mention as a metal because the potassium ion, K+, is an essential 
element required for plant growth. It is mined as potassium minerals and applied to soil as plant 
fertilizer. Potassium minerals consist of potassium salts, generally KCl. Such salts are found as 
deposits in the ground or may be obtained from some brines. Very large deposits are found in 
Saskatchewan, Canada. All the salts used as potassium sources are quite soluble in water.Batteries recycled, 2.8

18.5.8 Z INC
Zinc is relatively abundant and not particularly toxic, so its industrial ecology is of less concern than 
that of toxic lead or scarce chromium. As with other metals, the mining and processing of zinc can 
pose some environmental concerns. Zinc occurs as ZnS (a mineral called sphalerite), and the sulfur 
must be reclaimed as SO2 in the smelting of zinc. Zinc minerals often contain signifi  cant fractions of 
lead and copper, as well as signifi  cant amounts of toxic arsenic and cadmium. Zinc ore typically con-
taining about 6% zinc is concentrated by a fl  otation process in which air is bubbled into a slurry of 
fi nely ground zinc ore in water treated with special chemicals and a froth concentrate of zinc sulfi  de 
containing up to 50% zinc is skimmed off the top. Up to 90% of the zinc in the ore is recovered.
Zinc is widely used as the metal and to make alloys, particularly brass, an alloy with copper that 
is widely recycled. Lesser amounts of zinc are used to make zinc chemicals. One of the larger uses 
for zinc is as a corrosion-resistant coating on steel. This application, refi  ned to a high degree in the 
automotive industry in recent years, has signifi  cantly lengthened the life span of automotive bodies 
and frames. It is diffi  cult to reclaim zinc from zinc plating. However, zinc is a volatile element and 
it can be recovered in baghouse dust from electric arc furnaces used to reprocess scrap steel.
The most important zinc compound is zinc oxide, ZnO. Formerly widely used as a paint pigment, 
this white substance is now employed as an accelerating and activating agent for hardening rubber 
products, particularly tires. The other two major compounds of zinc employed commercially are 
zinc chloride used in dry cells, as a disinfectant, and to vulcanize rubber, and zinc sulfi  de, used in 
zinc electroplating baths.
Two aspects of zinc may be addressed with respect to its industrial ecology. The fi  rst of these is 
that, although it is not very toxic to animals, zinc is phytotoxic ( toxic to plants ) and soil can be 
“poisoned” by exposure to zinc from zinc smelting or from application of zinc-rich sewage sludge. 
The second of these is that the recycling of zinc is complicated by its dispersal as a plating on other 
metals. However, means do exist to reclaim signifi  cant fractions of such zinc, such as from electric 
arc furnaces as mentioned above.
18.6 NONMETAL MINERAL RESOURCES
A number of minerals other than those used to produce metals are important resources. As with 
metals, the environmental aspects of mining many of these minerals are quite important. Typically, 
even the extraction of ordinary rock and gravel can have important environmental effects.
Clays are secondary minerals formed by weathering processes on parent minerals (see Chapter 15, 
Section 15.7). Clays have a variety of uses. About 70% of the clays used are miscellaneous clays of 
variable composition that have uses for a number of applications including fi  ller (such as in paper), 
brick manufacture, tile manufacture, and portland cement production. Somewhat more than 10% of 
the clay used is fi  reclay, which has the characteristic of being able to withstand fi  ring at high tem-
peratures without warping. This clay is used to make a variety of refractories, pottery, sewer pipe, 
tile, and brick. Somewhat <10% of the clay that is used is kaolin, which has the general formula 
Al2(OH)4Si2O5. Kaolin is a white mineral that can be fi  red without losing shape or color. It is 
employed to make paper fi  ller, refractories, pottery, dinnerware, and as a petroleum-cracking cata-
lyst. About 7% of clay mined consists of bentonite and fuller’s earth, a clay of variable composition 
used to make drilling muds, petroleum catalyst, carriers for pesticides, sealers, and clarifying oils. 
Very small quantities of a highly plastic clay called ball clay are used to make refractories, tile, and 
whiteware. U.S. production of clay is about 42 million metric tons per year, and global and domestic 
resources are abundant.
Fluorine compounds are widely used in industry. Large quantities of fl  uorspar, CaF2, are 
required as a fl  ux in steel manufacture. Synthetic and natural cryolite, Na3AlF6, is used as a sol-
vent for aluminum oxide in the electrolytic preparation of aluminum metal. Sodium fl  uoride is 
added to water to help prevent tooth decay, a measure commonly called water fl  uoridation. World Resources and Sustainable Materials 501
reserves of high-grade fl  uorspar are around 190 million metric tons, about 13% of which is in the 
United States. This is suffi  cient for several decades at projected rates of use. A great deal of by-
product fl  uorine is recovered from the processing of fl  uorapatite, Ca5(PO4)3F, used as a source of 
phosphorus (see below).
Micas are complex aluminum silicate minerals that are transparent, tough, fl  exible, and elastic. 
Muscovite, K2O • 3Al2O3 • 6SiO2 • 2H2O, is a common type of mica. Better grades of mica are cut into 
sheets and used in electronic apparatus, capacitors, generators, transformers, and motors. Finely 
divided mica is widely used in roofi  ng, paint, welding rods, and many other applications. Sheet mica 
is imported into the United States, and fi  nely divided “scrap” mica is recycled domestically. 
Shortages of this mineral are unlikely.
Pigments and fi l l e r s  of various kinds are used in large quantities. The only naturally occurring 
pigments still in wide use are those containing iron. These minerals are colored by limonite, an 
amorphous brown-yellow compound with the formula 2Fe2O3 • 3H2O, and hematite, composed of 
gray-black Fe2O3. Along with varying quantities of clay and manganese oxides, these compounds 
are found in ocher, sienna, and umber. Manufactured pigments include carbon black, titanium diox-
ide, and zinc pigments. About 1.5 million metric tons of carbon black, manufactured by the partial 
combustion of natural gas, are used in the United States each year, primarily as a reinforcing agent 
in tire rubber.
Over 7 million metric tons of minerals are used in the United States each year as fi  llers for paper, 
rubber, roofi  ng, battery boxes, and many other products. Among the minerals used as fi  llers are 
carbon black, diatomite, barite, fuller’s earth, kaolin (see clays, above), mica, limestone, pyrophyl-
lite, and wollastonite (CaSiO3).
Although sand and gravel are the cheapest of mineral commodities per ton, the average annual 
dollar value of these materials is greater than all but a few mineral products because of the huge 
quantities involved. In tonnage, sand and gravel production is by far the greatest of nonfuel minerals. 
Almost 1 billion tons of sand and gravel are employed in construction in the United States each year, 
largely to make concrete structures, road paving, and dams. Slightly more than that amount is used 
to manufacture portland cement and as construction fi  ll. Although ordinary sand is predominantly 
silica, SiO2, about 30 million tons of a more pure grade of silica are consumed in the United States 
each year to make glass, high-purity silica, silicon semiconductors, and abrasives.
At present, old river channels and glacial deposits are used as sources of sand and gravel. Many 
v a l u a b l e  d e p o s i t s  o f  s a n d  a n d  g r a v e l  a r e  c o v e r e d  b y  c o n s t r u c t i o n  a n d  l o s t  t o  d e v e l o p m e n t .  
Transportation and distance from source to use are especially crucial for this resource. Environmental 
problems involved with defacing land can be severe, although bodies of water used for fi  shing and 
other recreational activities frequently are formed by removal of sand and gravel. 
18.7 PHOSPHATES
Phosphate minerals are of particular importance because of their essential use in the manufacture 
of fertilizers applied to land to increase crop productivity. In addition, phosphorus is used for sup-
plementation of animal feeds, synthesis of detergent builders, and preparation of chemicals such as 
pesticides and medicines. The most common phosphate minerals are hydroxyapatite, Ca5(PO4)3(OH), 
and fl  uorapatite, Ca5(PO4)3F. Ions of Na, Sr, Th, and U are found substituted for calcium in apatite 
minerals. Small amounts of PO43- may be replaced by AsO43- and the arsenic must be removed for 
food applications. Approximately 17% of world phosphate production is from igneous minerals, 
primarily fl  uorapatites. About three-fourth of world phosphate production is from sedimentary 
deposits, generally of marine origin. Vast deposits of phosphate, accounting for approximately 5% 
of world phosphate production, are derived from guano droppings of seabirds and bats. Current U.S. 
production of phosphate rock is around 40 million metric tons per year, most of it from Florida. 
Most of the available phosphate ore is of low grade so that its processing generates large quantities 
of by-product.5502 Environmental Chemistry
Naturally occurring phosphate minerals are not suffi  ciently soluble to be used as phosphate 
 fertilizer. For commercial phosphate fertilizer production, these minerals are treated with phos-
phoric or sulfuric acids to produce more soluble superphosphates as described in Chapter 16, Section 
16.7. The hydrogen fl  uoride (HF) produced as a by-product of superphosphate production from fl  uo-
rapatite can create air pollution problems, and the recovery of fl  uorides is an important aspect of the 
industrial ecology of phosphate production.
There are at least two major reasons why the industrial ecology of phosphorus is particularly 
important. The fi  rst of these is that current rates of phosphate use would exhaust known reserves of 
phosphate within two or three generations. Although additional sources of phosphorus will be found 
and exploited, it is clear that this essential mineral is in distressingly short supply relative to human 
consumption; phosphate shortages, along with sharply higher prices, will eventually cause a crisis 
in food production. The second signifi  cant aspect of the industrial ecology of phosphorus is the pol-
lution of waterways by waste phosphate, a plant, and algal nutrient. This results in excessive growth 
of algae in the water, followed by decay of the plant biomass, consumption of dissolved oxygen, and 
an undesirable condition of eutrophication.
Excessive use of phosphate coupled with phosphate pollution suggests that phosphate wastes, 
such as from sewage treatment, should be substituted as sources of plant fertilizer. Several other 
partial solutions to the problem of phosphate shortages are the following.
Development and implementation of methods of fertilizer application that maximize effi  - • 
cient utilization of phosphate
Genetic engineering of plants that have minimal phosphate requirements and that utilize • 
phosphorus with maximum effi  ciency
Development of systems to maximize the utilization of phosphorus-rich animal wastes• 
18.8 SULFUR
Sulfur is an important nonmetal; its greatest single use is in the manufacture of sulfuric acid. 
However, the element is employed in a wide variety of other industrial and agricultural products. 
Current consumption of sulfur amounts to approximately 10 million metric tons per year in the 
United States. The four most important sources of sulfur are (in decreasing order) deposits of ele-
mental sulfur, H2S recovered from sour natural gas, organic sulfur recovered from petroleum, and 
pyrite (FeS2) . R eco v ery o f s ulfur fro m coal used as a fue l is a h u g e poten tial, larg e l y un tapped 
source of this important nonmetal.
The resource situation for sulfur differs from that of phosphorus in several signifi  cant respects. 
Although sulfur is an essential nutrient like phosphorus, most soils contain suffi  cient amounts of 
nutrient sulfur, and the major uses of sulfur are in the industrial sector. The sources of sulfur are 
varied and abundant and supply is no problem either in the United States or worldwide; sulfur recov-
ery from fossil fuels as a pollution control measure could even result in surpluses of this element.
About 90% of the use of sulfur in the world is for the manufacture of sulfuric acid. Almost two-
third of the sulfuric acid consumed is used to make phosphate fertilizers as discussed in Section 18.7, 
in which case the phosphorus ends up as waste “phospho-gypsum,” CaSO4 • xH2O. Other uses of 
sulfuric acid include lead storage batteries, steel pickling, petroleum refi  ning, extraction of copper 
from copper ore, and the chemical industry.
The industrial ecology of sulfur needs to emphasize reduction of wastes and sulfur pollution, 
rather than supply of this element. Unlike many resources, such as most common metals, the uses 
of sulfur are for the most part dissipative, and the sulfur is “lost” to agricultural land, paper prod-
ucts, petroleum products, or other environmental sinks. There are two major environmental con-
cerns with sulfur. One of these is the emission of sulfur into the atmosphere, which occurs mostly 
as pollutant sulfur dioxide and is largely manifested by production of acidic precipitation and dry 
deposition. The second major environmental concern with sulfur is that it is used mostly as sulfuric Resources and Sustainable Materials 503
acid and is not incorporated into products, thus posing the potential to pollute water and create 
acidic wastes. Acid purifi  cation units are available to remove signifi  cant amounts of sulfuric acid 
from waste acid solutions for recycling. 
18.8.1 G YPSUM
Calcium sulfate in the form of the dihydrate CaSO4 . 2H2O is the mineral gypsum , one of the most 
common forms in which waste sulfur is produced. As noted, large quantities of this material are 
produced as a by-product of phosphate fertilizer manufacture. Another major source of gypsum is 
its production when lime is used to remove sulfur dioxide from power plant stack gas:
 Ca(OH)2 + SO2 Æ CaSO3 + H2O (18.3)
to produce a calcium sulfi  te product that can be oxidized to calcium sulfate. About 100 million 
metric tons of gypsum are mined each year for a variety of uses, including production of portland 
cement, to make wallboard, as a soil conditioner to loosen tight clay soils, and numerous other 
applications.
Calcium sulfate from industrial or natural (gypsum) sources can be calcined at a very low tem-
perature of only 159 ∞C to produce CaSO4 ·   1 _ 2  H2O, a material known as plaster of Paris, which was 
once commonly used for the manual application of plaster to walls. Plaster of Paris mixed with 
water forms a plastic material that sets up as the solid dihydrate:
 CaSO4 ·   1 _ 2  H2O +   3 _ 2  H2O Æ CaSO4 · 2H2O (18.4)
Cast into sheets coated with paper , this material produces plasterboard commonly used f or the 
interior walls of homes and other buildings. Historically, plaster of Paris was used for mortar and 
other structural applications, and it has the potential for similar applications today.
The very large quantities of gypsum that are mined suggest that by-product calcium sulfate, 
especially that produced with phosphate fertilizers and from fl  ue gas desulfurization, should be a 
good candidate for reclamation through the practice of industrial ecology. The low temperature (see 
above) required to convert hydrated calcium sulfate to CaSO4 ·   1 _ 2  H2O, which can be set up as a solid 
by mixing with water, suggests that the energy requirements for a gypsum-based by-products indus-
try should be modest. Low-density gypsum blown as a foam and used as a fi  ller in composites along 
with sturdy reinforcing materials should have good insulating, fi  re-resistant, and structural proper-
ties for building construction.
18.9 WOOD: A MAJOR RENEWABLE RESOURCE
Fortunately, one of the major natural resources in the world, wood, is a renewable resource. 
Production of wood and wood products is the fi  fth largest industry in the United States, and forests 
cover one-third of the U.S. surface area. Wood ranks fi  rst worldwide as a raw material for the manu-
facture of other products, including lumber, plywood, particle board, cellophane, rayon, paper, 
methanol, plastics, and turpentine.
Chemically, wood is a complicated substance consisting of long cells having thick walls com-
posed largely of polysaccharides such as cellulose, a glucose polymer shown in Chapter 22, 
Figure 22.5. In addition to the solid wood fraction consisting of cellulose and lignin (see Chapter 17, 
Section 17.6), a wide variety of tannins, pigments, sugars, starch, cyclitols, gums, mucilages, pec-
tins, galactans, terpenes, hydrocarbons, acids, esters, fats, fatty acids, aldehydes, resins, sterols, and 
waxes can be extracted from wood by water, alcohol-benzene, ether, and steam distillation. 504 Environmental Chemistry
Substantial amounts of methanol, a useful synthetic chemical and fuel once commonly called 
wood alcohol , are obtained from pyrolysis of wood.
A major use of wood is in paper manufacture. The widespread use of paper is a mark of an 
industrialized society. The manufacture of paper is a highly advanced technology. Paper consists 
essentially of cellulosic fi  bers tightly pressed together. To make paper, the lignin fraction must fi  rst 
be removed from the wood, leaving the cellulosic fraction. Both the sulfi  te and alkaline processes 
for accomplishing this separation have resulted in severe water and air pollution problems, now 
signifi  cantly alleviated through the application of advanced treatment technologies.
Wood fi  bers and particles can be used for making fi  berboard, paper-base laminates (layers of 
paper held together by a resin and formed into the desired structures at high temperatures and 
pressures), particle board (consisting of wood particles bonded together by a phenol-formal dehyde 
or urea-formaldehyde resin), and nonwoven textile substitutes consisting of wood fi  bers held 
together by adhesives. Wood chemical by-products including glucose and cellulose are potential 
major products from the 60 million metric tons of wood wastes produced in the United States 
each year.
18.10  EXTENDING RESOURCES THROUGH THE PRACTICE OF 
INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY
A tremendous potential exists for applying the practice of industrial ecology to lower the burden on 
virgin raw materials and sources of energy. These approaches include using less material (demate-
rialization), substitution of a relatively more abundant and safe material for one that is scarce and/or 
toxic, extracting useful materials from wastes (waste mining), and recycling materials and items. 
Properly applied, these measures can not only conserve increasingly scarce raw materials, but can 
also increase wealth as it is conventionally defi  ned. 
The greatest potential for extending material resources is by recycling through the practice of 
industrial ecology. One of the greatest savings in recycling is energy saved by the practice.
Materials vary in their amenability to recycling. Arguably the most recyclable materials are 
metals in a relatively pure form. Such metals are readily melted and recast into other useful com-
ponents. Among the least recyclable materials are mixed polymers or composites, the individual 
constituents of which cannot be readily separated. The chemistry of some polymers is such that, 
once they are prepared from monomers, they are not readily broken down again and reformed to a 
useful form. This section briefl  y addresses the kinds of materials that are recycled or that are can-
didates for recycling in a functional system of industrial ecology.
An important aspect of industrial ecology applied to recycling materials consists of the separa-
tion processes that are employed to “unmix” materials for recycling at the end of a product cycle. 
An example of this is the separation of graphite carbon fi  bers from the epoxy resins used to bind 
them together in carbon fi  ber composites. The chemical industry provides many examples where 
separations are required. For example, the separation of toxic heavy metals from solutions or 
sludges can yield a metal product, leaving nontoxic water and other materials for safe disposal 
or reuse.
18.10.1 M ETALS
Pure metals are easily recycled, and the greatest challenge is to separate the metals into a pure 
state. One of the more diffi  cult problems with metals recycling is the mixing of metals, such as 
problems that occur with metal alloys when a metal is plated onto another metal, or with compo-
nents made of two or more metals in which it is hard to separate the metals. A common example 
of the complications from mixing metals is the contamination of iron with copper from copper 
w i r i n g  o r  o t h e r  c o m p o n e n t s  m a d e  f r o m  c o p p e r .  A s  a n  i m p u r i t y ,  c o p p e r  p r o d u c e s  s t e e l  w i t h  Resources and Sustainable Materials 505
 inferior mechanical characteristics. Another problem can be the presence of toxic cadmium used 
as plating on steel parts.
Recycling metals can take advantage of the technology developed over many years of technology 
for the separation of metals that occur together in ores. Examples of by-product metals recovered 
during the refi  ning of other metals are gallium from aluminum; arsenic from lead or copper; pre-
cious metal iridium, osmium, palladium, rhodium, and ruthenium from platinum; and cadmium, 
germanium, indium, and thorium from zinc.
18.10.2 P LASTICS  AND RUBBER
Much attention has been given to the recycling of plastics in recent years. Compared to metals, 
plastics are much less recyclable because recycling is technically diffi  cult and plastics are less 
valuable than metals. There are two general classes of plastics, a fact that has a strong infl  uence 
on their recyclability. Thermoplastics are those that become fl  uid when heated and solid when 
cooled. Since they can be heated and reformed multiple times, thermoplastics are generally ame-
nable to recycling. Recyclable thermoplastics include polyalkenes (low-density and high-density 
polyethylene and polypropylene); polyvinylchloride (PVC), used in large quantities to produce 
pipe, house siding, and other durable materials; polyethylene terephthalate; and polystyrene. 
Plastic packaging materials are commonly made from thermoplastics and are potentially recy-
clable. Fortunately, from the viewpoint of recycling, thermoplastics make up most of the quanti-
ties of plastics used.
Thermosetting plastics are those that form molecular cross linkages between their polymeric 
units when they are heated. These bonds set the shape of the plastic, which does not melt when it is 
heated. Therefore, thermosetting plastics cannot be simply remolded; they are not very amenable to 
recycling, and often burning them for their heat content is about the only use to which they may be 
put. An important class of thermosetting plastics consists of the epoxy resins, characterized by an 
oxygen atom bonded between adjacent carbons (1,2-epoxide or oxirane). Epoxies are widely used in 
composite materials combined with fi  bers of glass or graphite. Other thermosetting plastics include 
cross-linked phenolic polymers, some kinds of polyesters, and silicones. When recycling is contem-
plated, the best use for thermosetting plastics is for the fabrication of entire components that can be 
recycled.
Contaminants are an important consideration in recycling plastics. A typical kind of contami-
nant is paint used to color the plastic object. Adhesives and coatings of various kinds may also act 
as contaminants. Such materials may weaken the recycled material or decompose to produce gases 
when the plastic is heated for recycling. Toxic cadmium used to enable polymerization of plastics, a 
“tramp element” in recycling parlance, can hinder recycling of plastics and restrict the use of the 
recycled products.
Large quantities of recycled polyester plastics from bottles can be used to make carpets. As of 
2008 Mohawk carpets was using 14,000 plastic drink bottles per minute, about one-third of those 
available for recycling in the United States, to make Everstrand carpet. It should be noted that the 
plastic used for bottled drinking water bottles, alone, in the United States requires around 175 mil-
lion liters of petroleum each year for their manufacture generating almost 1.5 million metric tons 
per year of waste. Only about one in four of these plastic bottles are recycled.
Although natural rubber was widely recycled during World War II, the synthetic rubbers devel-
oped as substitutes during the war were much less amenable to recycling. Countries throughout the 
world produce millions of spent vehicle tires, which can cause severe problems in waste dumps and 
are commonly used as fuel. One approach that is proving successful is to freeze the shredded rubber 
from tires in liquid nitrogen and grind it to a very fi  ne powder. This material is used as an additive 
for paints, coatings, and sealants to which it imparts some rubber properties including elasticity and 
impact resistance along with protection against ultraviolet radiation and ozone. The powdered 
 rubber product is also added to rubber used in new tires. 506 Environmental Chemistry
18.10.3 L UBRICATING  OIL
Lubricating oils are used in vast quantities and are prime candidates for recycling. The most 
 simplistic means of recycling lubricating oil is to burn it, and large volumes of oil are burned for 
fuel. This is a very low level of recycling and will not be addressed further here.
For many years the main process for reclaiming waste lubricating oil used treatment with sulfu-
ric acid followed by clay. This process generated large quantities of acid sludge and spent clay con-
taminated with oil. These undesirable by-products contributed substantial amounts of wastes to 
hazardous waste disposal sites. Current state-of-the-art practices of lubricating oil reclamation do 
not utilize large quantities of clay for cleanup, but instead use solvents, vacuum distillation, and 
catalytic hydrofi  nishing to produce a usable material from spent lubricating oil. The fi  rst step is 
dehydration to remove water and stripping to remove contaminant fuel (gasoline) fractions. If sol-
vent treatment is used, the oil is then extracted with a solvent, such as isopropyl or butyl alcohols or 
methylethylketone. After treatment with a solvent, the waste oil is commonly centrifuged to remove 
impurities that are not soluble in the solvent. The solvent is then stripped from the oil. The next step 
is a vacuum distillation that removes a light fraction useful for fuel and leaves a heavy residue that 
can be used for fuel. The lubricating oil can then be subjected to hydrofi  nishing, chemical addition 
of H2 over a catalyst, to produce a suitable lubricating oil product.

to Everything
19.1 ENERGY PROBLEM
It is a rather bold claim that sustainable energy is “the key to everything.” But a convincing argu-
ment can be made that most problems in the physical environment can be solved to at least a large 
degree if enough energy is available, if it is inexpensive enough, and if it can be used without doing 
irreparable environmental harm. Consider the following environmental and sustainability problems 
that can be solved at least in part with suffi  cient sustainable energy:
Water: With enough energy, wastewater can be reclaimed to drinking water standards by • 
reverse osmosis and other energy-consuming technologies and seawater can be desalinated.
Food: With enough energy, marginal land can be reclaimed by measures such as leveling, • 
terracing, and rock removal and irrigation water can be pumped from long distances or 
desalinated to grow food. Greenhouses can be heated even during winter months to grow 
high-value specialty foods.
Wastes: The disposal of hazardous organic wastes in landfi  lls, though widely practiced, is • 
not a good idea. With suffi  cient energy, such wastes can be converted to forms that cannot 
do harm.
Transportation: With suffi  cient sustainable energy, transportation problems can be solved • 
by technologies such as electrifi  ed railways.
Fuels: Biomass sources of fi  xed carbon can be converted to hydrocarbon fuels for applica- • 
tions for which there are no viable alternatives (such as aircraft) without adding any net 
amounts of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.
The list above can be extended to many other areas and to a large number of sustainability and 
environmental problems. The great challenge is, of course, that systems of energy utilization have 
developed that are unsustainable. One of the most obvious sustainability challenges is that human-
kind is running out of the sources of energy around which its economic systems have become based. 
This is especially true of petroleum. Peak U.S. petroleum production was passed several years ago, 
and it is likely that peak world production will be reached within a few years of 2010. Exorbitantly 
high petroleum prices in the fi  rst part of 2008 followed by a precipitous fall in price as world econo-
mies collapsed at the end of the year emphasized the economic uncertainties of reliance on petro-
leum as an energy source, especially by nations that do not have domestic sources. There are still 
abundant resources of coal, but their utilization to provide for energy with current technology almost 
certainly will cause unacceptable global warming. Therefore, the great challenge facing humankind 
during the next several decades is to develop sources of energy that will meet energy needs and that 
will not ruin Earth and its climate.
There are energy alternatives to fossil fuels that can be developed, that are environmentally 
safe (or can be made so), and that, taken in total, can be adequate to supply energy needs. These 510 Environmental Chemistry
include wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, and nuclear energy sources. Some other miscellaneous 
sources, such as tidal energy , may contribute as well. Fossil fuels will continue to be used and 
may contribute sustainably for decades with sequestration of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. 
And, of course, energy conservation and greatly enhanced effi  ciency of energy use will make 
substantial contributions. This chapter discusses the energy alternatives listed above with empha-
sis on energy sustainability.
19.2 NATURE OF ENERGY
Energy  is the capacity to do w ork (basically , to mo v e matter around) or heat in the form of the 
movement of atoms and molecules. Kinetic energy  is contained in moving objects. One such exam-
ple is the energy contained in a rapidly spinning fl  ywheel, a device of potentially great importance 
for energy storage to even out the energy fl  ow from intermittent solar and wind sources. Potential 
energy  is stored energy, such as in an elevated reservoir of water used as a means of storing hydro-
electric energy for later use that can be run through a hydroelectric turbine to generate electricity as 
needed.
A very important form of potential energy is chemical energy  stored in the bonds of molecules 
and released, usually as heat, when chemical reactions occur. For example, in the case of methane, 
CH4, in natural gas, when the methane burns,
 CH4 + 2O2 Æ CO2 + 2H2O (19.1)
the difference between the bond energies in the CO2 and H2O products and the CH4 and O2 reactants 
is released, primarily in the form of heat. If the heat is released by combustion of methane in a gas 
turbine, part of the heat energy can be converted to mechanical energy  in the form of the rapidly 
spinning turbine and an electrical generator to which it is attached. The generator, in turn, converts 
the mechanical energy to electrical energy .
The standard unit of energy is the joule , abbreviated J. A total of 4.184 J of heat energy will raise 
the temperature of 1 g of liquid water by 1°C. This amount of heat is equal to 1 calorie  of energy 
(1 cal = 4.184 J), the unit of energy formerly used in scientifi  c work. A joule is a small unit, and the 
kilojoule, kJ, equal to 1000 J is widely used in describing chemical processes. The “calorie” com-
monly used to express the energy value of food (and its potential to produce fat) is actually a kilo-
calorie, kcal, equal to 1000 cal.
Power  refers to energy generated, transmitted, or used per unit time. The unit of power is the 
watt, equal to an energy fl  ux of 1 J/s). A compact fl  uorescent light bulb adequate to illuminate a desk 
area might have a rating of 21 W. A large power plant may put out electricity at a power level of 
1000 megawatts  (MW, where 1 MW is equal to 1 million watts). Power on a national or global scale 
is often expressed in gigawatts , each one of which is equal to a billion watts or even terawatts , 
where a terawatt is equal to a trillion watts.
The science that deals with energy in its various forms and with work is thermodynamics . There 
are some important laws of thermodynamics. The fi  rst law of thermodynamics  states that energy is 
neither created nor destroyed. This law is also known as the law of conservation  of energy . The fi  rst 
law of thermodynamics must always be kept in mind in the practice of green technology, the best 
practice of which requires the most effi  cient use of energy. Thermodynamics enables calculation of 
the amount of usable energy. As described by the laws of thermodynamics, only a relatively small 
amount of the potential energy in fuel can be converted to mechanical energy or electrical energy 
with the remaining energy from the combustion of the fuel dissipated as heat. With the application 
of green technology, much of this heat is salvaged for applications such as district heating of homes.
Although energy is neither created nor destroyed, the amount of useful energy that can be 
obtained from a system can be dissipated. Useful mechanical energy can be produced, for example, Sustainable Energy: The Key to Everything 511
in a heat engine by harnessing part of the energy fl  ow from a hot to a cooler part of the system 
(Section 19.4 and Equation 19.5). The amount of this useful energy is called exergy  and it can go to 
zero in a system that has reached equilibrium.
19.3 SOURCES OF ENERGY USED IN THE ANTHROSPHERE
Before the 1800s, most of the energy used in the anthrosphere came from biomass produced during 
plant photosynthesis. Houses were heated with wood. Soil was cultivated and goods and people 
moved by the power of animals or by humans themselves, obtaining their energy from food bio-
mass. Wind drove sailing ships and windmills and falling water moved waterwheels. These sources 
were renewable and sustainable, with solar energy captured by photosynthesis to generate biomass, 
wind produced by temperature and pressure differences in solar-heated masses of atmospheric air, 
and fl  owing water moved as part of the solar-driven hydrologic cycle.
Although coal from readily accessible deposits had long been used in small quantities for home 
heating, exploitation of this energy source grew rapidly after the invention of the steam engine 
around 1800. During the 1800s, coal became the predominant source of energy in the United States, 
England, Europe, and other countries that had readily accessible coal resources, a major shift from 
renewable biomass, wind, and water to a depletable resource that had to be dug from the ground. By 
1900, petroleum had become a signifi  cant source of energy and by 1950 had surpassed coal as the 
United States’ leading energy supply. Lagging behind petroleum, natural gas had become a signifi  -
cant energy supplier by 1950. By 1950, hydroelectric power was providing a large fraction of energy 
used in the anthrosphere and still is. By around 1975, nuclear energy was supplying signifi  cant 
amounts of electricity and has maintained an appreciable share worldwide until the present. 
Miscellaneous renewable sources including geothermal and, more recently, solar and wind energy 
are making increasing contributions to total energy supply. Biomass still contributes signifi  cantly to 
the total of the sources of energy used.
Figure 19.1 shows U.S. and world energy sources used annually as of the year 2000. The pre-
dominance of fossil fuel  petroleum, natural gas, and coal are obvious. Estimates of the amounts of 
fossil fuels available differ. Those of the quantities of recoverable fossil fuels in the world before 
1800 as estimated around 1970 are given in Figure 19.2. By far, the greatest recoverable fossil fuel 
is in the form of coal and lignite.
Although world coal resources are enormous and potentially can fi  ll energy needs for a century 
or two, their utilization would become intolerable to earth’s environment because of environmental 
disruption from mining and emissions of carbon dioxide long before coal resources were exhausted. 
Assuming only uranium-235 as a fi  ssion fuel source, total recoverable reserves of nuclear fuel are 
roughly about the same as fossil fuel reserves. These are several orders of magnitude higher if the 
use of breeder reactors that convert normally unfi  ssionable uranium-238 to fi  ssionable plutonium-
239 is assumed. Extraction of only 2% of the deuterium present in the earth’s oceans would yield

Zealand, has the potential for providing a signifi  cant percentage of energy worldwide. The same 
limited potential is characteristic of several renewable energy resources, including hydroelectric 
energy, tidal energy, and especially wind power. All of these will continue to contribute signifi  cant 
amounts of energy. Renewable, nonpolluting solar energy comes close to being an ideal energy 
source and it almost certainly has a bright future.
The contributions of different fossil fuels to greenhouse gas carbon dioxide emissions vary with 
the chemical nature of the fuel with greater contributions from those that have relatively less 
 hydrogen. For example, the chemical reaction for the combustion of methane, CH4,
 CH4 + 2O2 Æ CO2 + 2H2O + energy (19.2) 
shows that 2 molecules of H2O are produced for each molecule of CO2. Since the conversion of 
chemically bound hydrogen to H2O produces a large amount of heat, a relatively smaller amount of 
CO2 is released per unit of heat generated. Petroleum hydrocarbons, such as those in gasoline or 
diesel fuel contain essentially only 2 atoms of H per atom of C. The combustion of such a molecule 
showing the conversion of 1 atom of C to CO2 is represented as

demonstrating that only half as much hydrocarbon-bound H is burned per molecule of CO2 pro-
duced, so signifi  cantly less energy is produced per C atom than in the combustion of natural gas. 
Coal is even worse. Coal is a black hydrocarbon with an approximate simple formula of CH0.8, so 
the combustion of an atom of carbon in coal can be represented as the following:

The problem that industrialized societies have become dependent on unsustainable fossil energy 
is clear, the solution less so. Alternatives must be developed and the transition to them will not be 
easy. The alternatives are discussed later in this chapter.
19.4 ENERGY DEVICES AND CONVERSIONS
Energy occurs in many forms and its utilization requires conversion to other forms. Many devices 
exist for the utilization of energy and its conversion to other forms. The most common of these are 
shown in Figure 19.3. The types of energy available, the forms in which it is utilized, and the pro-
cesses by which it is converted to other forms have a number of implications for green technology 
and sustainability. For example, the wind turbine shown in Figure 19.3(1), once in place, continues 
to pump electricity into the power grid with virtually no harm to the environment (although some 
people regard them as unsightly while others think they are picturesque), whereas the steam power 
plant shown in Figure 19.3(2) requires mining of depletable coal, combustion of the fossil fuel with 
its potential for air pollution, control of air pollutants, and means for cooling the steam exiting the 
turbine, with its potential for thermal pollution of waterways.
An important aspect of energy utilization is its conversion to usable forms. For example, gasoline 
burned in au to m o b il e en gines co mes ori ginall y fro m petro l eum pumped fro m un der groun d, the 
petroleum constituents are separated, molecules with properties suitable for engine fuel are pro-
duced chemically, the gasoline product is burned in an internal combustion engine converting 
chemical to mechanical energy, and the mechanical energy is transmitted to the wheels of the auto-
mobile in the form of kinetic energy that moves the automobile. Signifi  cantly, less than half of the 
energy in the gasoline is actually converted to mechanical energy of the automobile’ s motion; the 
rest is dissipated as waste heat through the engine’s cooling system.
Figure 19.4 illustrates major forms of energy and conversions between them. A signifi  cant point 
of this illustration is the very large ranges of energy conversion effi  ciencies from just a few percent 
or less to almost 100%. These differences suggest areas in which improvements may be sought. 
One of the most striking effi  ciencies is the less than 0.5% conversion of light energy to chemical 
energy by photosynthesis. Despite such a low conversion effi  ciency, photosynthesis has generated 
the fossil fuels, from which industrialized societies now get their energy and provide a signifi  cant 
fraction of energy in areas where wood and agricultural wastes are used. Doubling photosynthesis 
effi ciency with genetically engineered plants could be a major factor in making biomass a more 
desirable energy source. Replacement of woefully ineffi  cient incandescent light bulbs with fl  uores-
cent bulbs that are 5–6 times more effi  cient in converting electrical energy to light can save large 
amounts of energy and will be mandated in the United States by legislation passed in 2007.
A particularly important energy conversion carried out in the anthrosphere is that of heat, such 
as from chemical combustion of fuel, to mechanical energy used to propel a vehicle or run an elec-
trical generator. This occurs, for example, when gasoline in a gasoline engine burns, generating hot 
gases that move pistons in the engine connected to a crankshaft that converts the up-and-down 
movement of the piston to rotary motion that drives a vehicle’s wheels. It also occurs when hot steam 
generated at high pressure in a boiler fl  ows through a turbine connected directly to an electrical 
generator. A device, such as a steam turbine, in which heat energy is converted to mechanical 
energy is called a heat engine. Unfortunately, the laws of thermodynamics dictate that the conver-
sion of heat to mechanical energy is always much less than 100% effi  cient. The effi  ciency of this 
conversion is given by the Carnot equation,
 12
1Percent efficiency 100-=¥TT
T (19.5)514 Environmental Chemistry
in which T1 is the inlet temperature (e.g., of steam into a steam turbine) and T2 is the outlet tempera-
ture, both expressed in Kelvin (°C +273). Consider a steam turbine as shown in Figure 19.5. Substitution 
into the Carnot equation of 875 K for T1 and 335 K for T2 gives a maximum theoretical effi  ciency of 
62%. However, it is not possible to introduce all the steam at the highest temperature and friction 
losses occur so that the energy conversion effi  ciency of most modern steam turbines is just below 
50%. About 80% of the chemical energy released by combustion of fossil fuel in a boiler is actually 
transferred to water to produce steam so that the net effi  ciency for conversion of chemical energy in 
fossil fuels to mechanical energy to produce electricity is about 40%. The overall conversion of

chemical energy to electricity is essentially the same because an electrical generator converts virtu-
ally all of the energy of a rotating turbine to electricity. Because nuclear reactor peak temperatures 
are limited for safety reasons, their conversion of nuclear energy to electricity is only about 30%.
A particularly important machine for converting chemical to mechanical energy is the internal 
combustion piston engine shown in Figure 19.6. Most internal combustion engines operate on a 
cycle of four strokes. In the fi  rst of these, the piston moves downward drawing air or an air/fuel 
mixture into the cylinder. Next, with both valves closed, the air or air/fuel mixture is compressed as 
the piston moves upward. With the piston near the top of the cylinder (a point at which fuel may be 
injected if only air is compressed), ignition occurs and the burning fuel creates a mass of highly 
pressurized combustion gas in the cylinder, which drives the piston down in the third stroke. The 
exhaust valve then opens and the exhaust gas is expelled during the exhaust stroke.
The effi  ciency of the internal combustion engine increases with the peak temperature reached by 
the burning fuel, which increases with the degree of compression during the compression stroke Radiant

(around 20:1 for a modern diesel engine). This temperature is highest for the diesel engine in which 
the compression is so high that fuel injected into the combustion chamber ignites without a spark 
plug ignition source. Whereas a standard gasoline engine is typically about 25% effi  cient in convert-
ing chemical energy in fuel to mechanical energy, a diesel engine is typically 37% effi  cient, with 
some reaching higher values.
Although highly superior from the standpoint of effi  ciency, diesel engines do have some disad-
vantages with respect to emissions. The fi  rst of these is that the combustion zone is not homoge-
neous because the fuel is injected into the highly compressed air at the top of the compression stroke 
resulting in incomplete combustion and production of carbon particles; improperly adjusted diesel 
engines are a major source of particle air pollution in urban areas. In addition, because of their very 
high combustion temperatures and high ignition pressures, diesel engines tend to produce elevated 
levels of air pollutant nitrogen oxides. Recent advances in diesel engine design, computerized con-
trol, and exhaust pollutant control devices have greatly reduced diesel engine emissions.
19.4.1 F UEL CELLS
Fuel cells are devices that convert the energy released by electrochemical reactions directly to elec-
tricity without going through a combustion process and electricity generator. Fuel cells are the pri-
mary means for utilizing hydrogen fuel and are becoming more common as electrical generators. A 
fuel cell has an anode at which elemental hydrogen is oxidized, releasing electrons to an external 
circuit, and a cathode at which elemental oxygen is reduced by electrons introduced from the exter-
nal circuit, as shown by the half-reactions in Figure 19.7. The H+ ions generated at the anode migrate 
to the cathode through a solid membrane permeable to protons. The net reaction is
 2H2 + O2 Æ 2H2O + electrical energy (19.6)
and the only product of the fuel cell reactions is water.
Although elemental hydrogen is the ultimate fuel for fuel cells, it may be produced by the chemi-
cal breakdown of hydrogen-rich fuels, such as methane, methanol, or even gasoline, a process that 
also generates carbon dioxide. Tubular-style solid-oxide fuel cells, such as those manufactured by 
Siemens Westinghouse, operate at an elevated temperature of about 1000°C and produce an exhaust 
that is hot enough to drive a turbine or even to cogenerate steam. Such systems may be able to 
develop overall effi  ciencies of up to 80%.

19.5 GREEN TECHNOLOGY AND ENERGY CONVERSION EFFICIENCY
One of the best ways to conserve fuel resources is through increasing the effi  ciency of energy con-
version including that of chemical to mechanical energy with the intermediate step of production of 
heat energy. Many advances have been made in this area since the late 1800s. Part of the increase 
in conversion of fuel energy to electricity going from around 4% conversion in 1900 to more than 
40% at present resulted from increasing the input temperature ( T1 in the Carnot equation) in the heat 
engines driving electrical generators. Energy use effi  ciency increased by more than fourfold when 
picturesque steam engines were replaced by diesel/electric locomotives during the 1940s and 1950s. 
Substitution of diesel engines for gasoline engines in trucks and farm and construction equipment 
have resulted in gains in energy effi  ciency.
Much of the increased effi  ciency in fuel utilization has come from improved materials that allow 
higher operating temperatures. In addition to high-temperature-tolerant metals in engines, a contri-
bution has been made by lubricating oils that do not break down at high temperatures. Much of the 
progress has been achieved with better engineering, now greatly aided by computerized design, 
evaluation, and manufacturing of engines. Engineers of a century ago had never heard of green 
technology, and probably would not have cared had they known about it. But they did understand 
costs of fuel (which, on the basis of constant value currency, were often higher then than they are 
now) and they welcomed the greater effi  ciencies they achieved on the basis of costs.
A key aspect of the most effi  cient conversion of chemical to mechanical energy in engines is the 
precise control of operational aspects such as ignition timing, valve timing, and fuel injection. In 
modern engines, key operation parameters are controlled by computers leading to optimum effi  -
ciency in engine operation.
As an inevitable consequence of the thermodynamics described by the Carnot equation, engines 
that convert heat to mechanical energy cannot utilize much of the heat, which is carried away by an 
engine cooling system. Typically, a small portion of this heat is used in automotive heaters on cold 
days. On a broader scale, such as municipal electrical systems, this heat can be used for heating 
buildings. Such effi  ciencies are discussed under “Combined Power Cycles” in Section 19.17.H2 O2

19.6 ENERGY CONSERVATION AND RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES
Any consideration of energy needs and production must take energy conservation into consider-
ation. This does not have to mean cold classrooms with thermostats set at 60°F in mid-winter, nor 
swelteringly hot homes with no air-conditioning, nor total reliance on the bicycle for transportation, 
although these and even more severe conditions are routine in many countries. The fact remains that 
the United States and several other industrialized nations have wasted energy at a deplorable rate. 
For example, U.S. energy consumption is higher per capita than that of some other countries that 
have equal, or signifi  cantly better, living standards. Obviously, a great deal of potential exists for 
energy conservation that will ease the energy problem.
Effi cient use of energy can in fact correlate positively with higher economic standards. Figure 19.8 
shows a plot of the ratio of energy use per unit of gross domestic product in developed industrialized 
nations and illustrates a steady and favorable decrease of energy required relative to economic out-
put. Whereas in 2000, 1.7 barrels of oil equivalents were required per $1000 gross domestic product 
in developed nations, the corresponding fi  gure for developing nations, which tend to lack advanced 
means of using energy effi  ciently, was 5.2 barrels, or 3 times as much. These fi  gures indicate the 
substantial potential for decreased energy consumption by energy conscious development of the less 
industrially advanced nations as well as the additional conservation that can be achieved if citizens 
of industrialized nations can be persuaded to forego wasteful energy practices such as using exces-
sively large and ineffi  cient vehicles and living in overly large dwellings.
Transportation is the economic sector with the greatest potential for increased effi  ciencies. The 
private auto and airplane are only about one-third as effi  cient as buses or trains for transportation. 
Transportation of freight by a truck requires about 3800 Btu/ton-mile, compared to only 670 Btu/ton-
mile for a train. Truck transport is terribly ineffi  cient (as well as dangerous, labor-intensive, and envi-
ronmentally disruptive) compared to rail transport. Major shifts in current modes of transportation in 
the United States will not come without anguish, but energy conservation dictates that they be made.
Figure 19.9 shows the trend in U.S. automobile fuel economy during recent decades. The gains 
through about 1990 were very impressive, then dropped off as less fuel effi  cient vehicles became 
more popular. If the same trends from this period would have been maintained, the U.S. automobile 
fl eet would by now average close to 40 miles per gallon (MPG). Such a fi  gure is readily achievable 
without seriously compromising safety or comfort and, as is obvious from the fi  gure, with much 
lower emissions from pollutants today as compared to in 1970. In 2007, the U.S. Congress passed 
legislation mandating higher fuel economy standards for vehicles sold in the United States.
Household and commercial uses of energy are relatively effi  cient. Here again, appreciable sav-
ings can be made. The all-electric home requires much more energy ( considering the percentage

wasted in generating electricity) than a home heated with fossil fuels. The sprawling ranch-house 
style home uses much more energy per person than does an apartment unit, row house, or even a 
home of comparable fl  oor area built in a compact format (more like a square box). Improved insula-
tion, sealing around the windows, and other measures can conserve a great deal of energy. Electricity 
generating plants centrally located in cities can provide waste heat for commercial and residential 
heating and cooling and, with proper pollution control, can use municipal refuse for part of their 
fuel, thus reducing quantities of solid wastes requiring disposal. 
One of the greatest contributions to energy conservation and energy use effi  ciency in very recent 
years has been the hybrid vehicle  that uses an internal combustion engine to produce electricity that 
is stored for propulsion of the vehicle in a nickel-metal-hydride battery (Figure 19.10). Although not 
greatly more effi  cient for prolonged driving at highway speeds, these vehicles have achieved 
improvements up to 50% in stop-and-go driving in traffi  c. For routine operation, the internal com-
bustion engine supplies all the power needed plus additional power, if required, to run the generator 
to recharge a battery (larger than the battery in a conventional automobile but signifi  cantly smaller 
than the battery in an all-electric vehicle). When a surge of power is required, electricity from the 
storage battery drives the electric motor to produce the additional power. The braking system also 
generates electricity that is stored in the battery. When the vehicle is stopped, the internal combus-
tion engine does not run, which also saves fuel.

markedly while emissions have been greatly reduced.520 Environmental Chemistry
Vastly reduced fuel consumption can be achieved by hybrid vehicles now under development that 
have batteries that can be charged by an external electrical source as well as the onboard engine. 
Such vehicles could give around 40–50 km driving range from an overnight charge alone, suffi  cient 
for the majority of routine driving. As the battery runs down, the internal combustion engine would 
recharge it as is the case with current hybrids. As of 2009, batteries were under development that 
could be recharged effi  ciently by both an external source of electricity and by an internal combus-
tion engine coupled to a generator.
Although gasoline engines are now employed in hybrid vehicles, the ultimate in fuel economy 
could be achieved with an inherently more effi  cient diesel engine as the internal combustion engine 
component. By allowing the diesel engine to run at a generally steady rate, the output of exhaust 
pollutants, which are produced at higher levels by diesel engines as the engine speed is changed, 
could be greatly reduced. Furthermore, diesel engines idle with remarkably little fuel consumption, 
so that the diesel engine would not need to be turned off when the vehicle is stopped, thus staying 
hot and further reducing emissions when it is brought up to speed.
As scientists and engineers undertake the crucial task of developing alternative energy sources 
to replace dwindling petroleum and natural gas supplies, energy conservation must receive proper 
emphasis. In fact, zero energy-use growth, at least on a per capita basis, is a worthwhile and achiev-
able goal. Such a policy would go a long way toward solving many environmental problems. 
With ingenuity, planning, and proper management, it could be achieved while increasing the stan-
dard of living and quality of life.
Closely related to energy conservation is the concept of renewable energy  from sources that do not 
run out. Essentially all of these depend on energy from the sun including direct solar energy, wind 
driven by the solar heating of air masses, falling water from the solar-powered hydrologic cycle, and 
biomass formed from photosynthesis. For most of its lifetime on Earth, humankind has depended 
entirely on renewable sources of energy, and most countries are again emphasizing these sources.
Enlightened sustainable energy policies are being implemented in some developing countries. 
China implemented a new law on renewable energy at the beginning of 2006. This policy encour-
ages renewable energy alternatives including wind power, biomass energy, and biomethane genera-
tion. Long known for its utilization of wastes (including even use of human wastes as fertilizer for 
growing vegetables), China has constructed many waste-to-methane generators in rural areas with 
17 million families served by such facilities by 2006. Experimental biopower projects burning crop 
biomass by-products have been undertaken. As of 2006, China had 80 million square meters of 
solar collectors to heat water, equivalent to the energy from 10 million tons per year of coal. The 
total renewable energy capacity of China in 2006 was 7% of China’s energy use, equivalent to 
160 million tons of coal per year.
19.7 PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS
Liquid petroleum  occurs in rock formations ranging in porosity from 10% to 30%. Up to half of the 
pore space is occupied by water. The oil in these formations must fl  o w o v er long distances to an 
approximately 15-cm diameter well from which it is pumped. The rate of fl  ow depends on the perme-
ability of the rock formation, the viscosity of the oil, the driving pressure behind the oil, and other 
factors. Because of limitations in these factors, primary recovery  of oil yields an average of about 
30% of the oil in the formation, although it is sometimes as little as 15%. More oil can be obtained 
using secondary recovery  techniques, which involve forcing water under pressure into the oil-bear-
ing formation to drive the oil out. Primary and secondary recovery together typically extract some-
what less than 50% of the oil from a formation. Finally, tertiary recovery  can be used to extract even 
more oil, normally through the injection of pressurized carbon dioxide, which forms a mobile solu-
tion with the oil and allows it to fl  ow more easily to the well. Other chemicals, such as detergents, 
may be used to aid in tertiary recovery. Currently, about 300 billion barrels of U.S. oil are not avail-
able through primary recovery alone. A recovery effi  ciency of 60% through secondary or tertiary Sustainable Energy: The Key to Everything 521
techniques could double the amount of available petroleum. Much of this would come from fi  elds that 
have already been abandoned or essentially exhausted using primary recovery techniques.
The year 2008 was a very interesting one for world oil production and consumption. In July of 
that year, prices reached record levels of more than $150/barrel and many experts forecast that 
prices would continue to increase with gasoline going well over the $5/gallon reached in parts of the 
United States. With the world economic collapse that took place in the fall of 2008, petroleum 
prices fell precipitously , reaching levels of around $40/barrel. The year also saw the fi  rst drop in 
world oil consumption since 1983 down to 85.8 million barrels per day and U.S. consumption 
dropped 6.3% to 19.4 million barrels per day.
Shale oil  is a possible substitute for liquid petroleum. Shale oil is a pyrolysis product of oil shale, 
a rock containing organic carbon in a complex structure of biological origin from eons past called 
kerogen. Oil shale is believed to contain approximately 1.8 trillion barrels of shale oil that could be 
recovered from deposits in Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah. In the Colorado Piceance Creek basin 
alone, more than 100 billion barrels of oil could be recovered from prime shale deposits. However, 
the environmental implications of recovering shale oil by heating oil shale include production of 
vast amounts of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Furthermore, potential water pollution problems 
from water-soluble salt residues left over from the pyrolysis of oil shale make it unlikely that this 
resource will ever be developed on a large scale.
Natural gas , consisting almost entirely of methane, is a very attractive fuel that produces few 
pollutants and less carbon dioxide per unit energy than any other fossil fuel. In addition to its use as 
a fuel, natural gas can be converted to many other hydrocarbon materials. It can be used as a raw 
material for the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis of gasoline. As of the early 2000s, increased demand for 
natural gas had led to tight supplies in the United States. Production of natural gas from coal seams 
in Wyoming has required pumping saline, alkaline water from the seams, which has caused water 
pollution problems. By 2009, exploitation of natural gas in “tight” shale formations opened by frac-
turing with water had resulted in increased supply of natural gas in the United States and some other 
countries.
19.8 COAL
From Civil War times until World War II, coal was the dominant energy source behind industrial 
expansion in most nations. However, after World War II, the greater convenience of lower cost 
petroleum resulted in a decrease in the use of coal for energy in the United States and in a number 
of other countries. Annual coal production in the United States fell by about one-third, reaching a 
low of approximately 400 million tons in 1958, but since then coal production for electricity genera-
tion has reached about 1 billion tons per year in the United States. About one-third of the world’s 
energy and around 50% of electrical energy is provided by coal.
The general term coal describes a large range of solid fossil fuels derived from partial degrada-
tion of plants. Coal is differentiated largely by coal rank  based on the percentage of fi  xed carbon, 
percentage of volatile matter, and heating value. The approximate average empirical formula of coal 
is CH0.8 and coal typically contains from 1 to several percent sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen. Of these 
elements, sulfur bound to the organic coal molecule and mixed with coal as mineral pyrite, FeS2, 
presents major environmental problems because of production of air pollutant sulfur dioxide during 
combustion. Much of the FeS2 can be removed physically from coal prior to combustion and sulfur 
dioxide can be removed from stack gas by various scrubbing processes.
19.8.1 C OAL CONVERSION
As shown in Figure 19.11, coal can be converted to gaseous, liquid, or low-sulfur, low-ash solid 
fuels such as coal char ( coke ) or solvent-refi  ned coal ( SR C). Coal conversion is an old idea; a 
house belonging to William Murdock at Redruth, Cornwall, England, was illuminated with coal 522 Environmental Chemistry
gas in 1792. The fi  rst municipal coal-gas system was employed to light Pall Mall in London in 
1807. The coal-gas industry began in the United States in 1816. The early coal-gas plants used 
coal pyrolysis (heating in the absence of air) to produce a hydrocarbon-rich product particularly 
useful for illumination. Later in the 1800s, the water-gas process was developed, in which steam 
was impinged on hot coal coke to produce a mixture consisting primarily of H2 and CO. It was 
necessary to add volatile hydrocarbons to this “carbureted” water-gas to bring its illuminating 
power up to that of gas prepared by coal pyrolysis. The United States had 11,000 coal gasifi  ers 
operating in the 1920s. At the peak of its use in 1947, the water-gas method accounted for 57% of 
U.S.-manufactured gas. The gas was made in low-pressure, low-capacity gasifi  ers that by today’s 
standards would be ineffi  cient and environmentally unacceptable (many sites of these old plants 
have been designated as hazardous waste sites because of residues of coal tar and other wastes). 
This was defi  nitely not a green technology because of the high toxicity of carbon monoxide in the 
gas product, and many people were killed by release of CO in their houses. During World War II, 
Germany developed a major synthetic petroleum industry based on coal, which reached a peak 
capacity of 100,000 barrels per day in 1944. A synthetic petroleum plant operating in Sasol, 
South Africa, reached a capacity of several tens of thousands of tons of coal per day in the 1970s 
and currently produces hydrocarbons and feedstocks equivalent to about 150,000 barrels of 
petroleum per day.
A number of environmental implications are involved in the widespread use of coal conversion. 
These include strip mining, water consumption in arid regions, lower overall energy conversion 
compared to direct coal combustion, and increased output of atmospheric carbon dioxide. These 
plus economic factors have prevented coal conversion from being practiced on a very large scale. 
However, coal conversion does enable relatively facile carbon sequestration (see Section 19.9), which 
could enable much more sustainable coal utilization.Air gasification Cleanup Low Btu gas

19.9 CARBON SEQUESTRATION FOR FOSSIL FUEL UTILIZATION
Carbon sequestration , which prevents carbon dioxide generated by fossil fuels from entering the 
atmosphere, holds the promise of enabling utilization of fossil fuels without contributing to green-
house warming. Basically, the various schemes that have been proposed entail capturing carbon 
dioxide from a product or waste stream and sequestering it in a place where it cannot enter the atmo-
sphere. Several approaches have been suggested or tried for capturing carbon dioxide and there are 
several possibilities for sequestration. The term “carbon sequestration” is also used in a more general 
sense to apply to the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, especially by photosynthesis.
There are several possible sinks in which carbon dioxide can be sequestered. The largest of these, 
a natural sink for the gas, is the ocean. Earth’s oceans have an almost inexhaustible capacity for 
carbon dioxide. However, lowering the average pH of the oceans by as little as 0. 1 pH unit from 
acidic carbon dioxide could have a serious adverse effect on ocean life and productivity; there is 
some evidence to suggest that shells of some small sea creatures have become thinner because of 
higher levels of dissolved carbon dioxide in ocean water. Deep saline formations also have a very 
high capacity for carbon dioxide sequestration. Depleted oil and gas reservoirs and unmineable coal 
seams have much lower, but still signifi  cant, carbon dioxide capacities.
Geological carbon dioxide sequestration can be accomplished by injecting the gas into porous 
sedimentary formations at depths exceeding approximately 1000 m. Experience in the petroleum 
industry with underground disposal of carbon dioxide and injection of the gas into oil-bearing for-
mations for petroleum recovery have provided the technology required for geological carbon dioxide 
sequestration. The carbon dioxide injected into sedimentary formations rises and is confi  ned by 
poorly permeable caprock. Breaches in caprock, such as those from abandoned oil wells, can result 
in carbon dioxide release. Eventually, the carbon dioxide dissolves in the generally saline pore 
waters in the sedimentary formation into which it is injected. Chemical reactions in the water and 
with the surrounding geological strata can result in long-term stability of the carbon dioxide. It is 
much more effective and less expensive to force carbon dioxide into unsaturated saline groundwater 
where it is dissolved than to compress the gas into a pressurized gas form underground.1
The fi  rst commercial application of carbon dioxide sequestration has operated since 1996 in the 
North Sea about 240 km from the Norwegian coast in a region known as the Sleipner oil and gas 
fi eld. The natural gas product from this fi  eld is about 9% carbon dioxide, a value that must be 
reduced to 2.5% for commercial distribution of the gas. Whereas all other gas-producing operations 
simply discharge the carbon dioxide removed to the atmosphere, at Sleipner it is pumped under pres-
sure into a 200-m thick layer of sandstone, the Utsira formation, which is about 1000 m below the 
seabed. A mixture of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfi  de removed from sour natural gas that is 
abundant in Alberta, Canada, is now being sequestered underground.2
The easiest sources of carbon dioxide to capture are those from industrial processes that generate 
the gas in high concentrations. An example of such a process is the fermentation of carbohydrates to 
produce ethanol for fuel or other uses. This source provides much of the carbon dioxide that is used 
commercially at present. The largest anthropogenic source of carbon dioxide discharged to the atmo-
sphere is generated in power plants fueled with fossil fuels. These sources present a substantial chal-
lenge for carbon dioxide removal because they are so dilute. A power plant fueled with carbon-rich 
coal produces an exhaust stream that is 13–15% carbon dioxide, whereas one burning hydrogen-rich 
methane produces only 3–5% carbon dioxide. A third possibility is to capture carbon dioxide released 
from the gasifi  cation of fossil fuels, particularly coal (see Section 19.8). Normally, gasifi  cation is per-
formed using oxygen as an oxidant, and the initial product consists of carbon dioxide and combustible 
H2 and CO gases. Carbon monoxide in the synthesis gas product can be reacted with steam,
 CO + H2O Æ H2 + CO2 (19.7)
to produce nonpolluting elemental hydrogen fuel and carbon dioxide.524 Environmental Chemistry
In late 2007, the U.S. Department of Energy announced funding for the construction of the fi  rst U.S. 
power plant with carbon dioxide sequestration, the FutureGen coal-powered power plant to be located 
at a site in Mattoon, Illinois. The project was abruptly canceled in early 2008 allegedly because of 
greatly increased costs, but a Government Accountability Offi  ce report released in March 2009 showed 
that the costs had been overestimated by $500 million because of an accounting cost mathematics 
error! The 275 MW power plant was to be large enough to supply electricity to 275,000 households 
and to sequester 1–2 million tons of carbon dioxide per year. Figure 19.12 is a schematic of a coal-fi  red 
power plant with carbon sequestration such as the FutureGen power plant. A gas turbine powered by 
hydrogen fuel produced by coal gasifi  cation generates electricity. Hot exhaust gas from the gas turbine 
is used to raise steam in a boiler and this steam powers a steam turbine that is also coupled to a genera-
tor. This combination results in very effi  cient electrical power generation. The production of interme-
diate hydrogen adds options for powering fuel cells or for using hydrogen in chemical synthesis or 
manufacture of synthetic hydrocarbon fuels. By-product hydrogen sulfi  de must be removed from the 
hydrogen product and can be used for making sulfuric acid, an important industrial chemical, or can 
be sequestered with the carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide by-product is sequestered in mineral for-
mations at depths up to around 2000 m. For power plants located near petroleum-bearing formations, 
carbon dioxide can be pumped into oil-bearing mineral formations for tertiary petroleum recovery.
19.10 INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY FOR ENERGY AND CHEMICALS
An excellent example of a system of industrial ecology for sustainable utilization of fossil fuels 
is provided by the Great Plains Synfuel plant located near Beulah, North Dakota. This complex

Waste heat is reclaimed for district heating and industrial heating applications.Sustainable Energy: The Key to Everything 525
of the system is shown in Figure 19.13. The heart of the plant consists of 14 Lurgi-type gasifi  ers 
that are 13 m high and 4 m in diameter processing 16,000 metric tons of lignite per day at tem-
peratures up to 1200°C to produce a synthesis gas mixture of combustible H2 and CO along with 
by-products CO2, water, and smaller quantities of tars, oils, phenolic compounds, ammonia, and 
H2S. Useful fuel hydrocarbons, phenol, cresols, ammonia, and sulfur compounds are extracted 
from the water, which is used for cooling water. The gas mixture is subjected to a shift reaction 
that increases the ratio of H2 to CO and this mixture is reacted to produce methane (CH4) that is 
fed into a natural gas pipeline. Part of the synthesis gas stream is diverted to an ammonia syn-
thesis plant to make this valuable fertilizer product. A key feature of the plant is the extraction 
of CO2 from the synthesis gas. The carbon dioxide is compressed and sent through a pipeline to 
Canada where it is pumped underground to depleted petroleum-bearing strata for secondary 
recovery of crude oil.
The Great Plains Synfuels plant provides an excellent example of a diversifi  ed industrial ecol-
ogy complex. It utilizes an abundant resource (lignite coal) in a way that signifi  cantly reduces the 
greenhouse gas emissions and other potential environmental impacts from this resource. Rather 
than having to transport large quantities of lignite by rail to distant power plants, the energy con-
tent of the lignite is converted to methane, the most environmentally friendly fossil fuel, which is 
moved with minimum environmental disruption through pipelines. An even higher value product, 
fertilizer ammonia, is synthesized at the site using elemental hydrogen made from gasifying the 
lignite and elemental nitrogen isolated from air in the air liquefaction operation required to prepare 
elemental oxygen required for gasifi  cation. The carbon dioxide by-product is not released to the 
atmosphere where it could aggravate the global warming problem but is pumped to oilfi  elds where 
it is pumped underground to increase crude oil recovery. Commercially valuable ammonium sul-
fate by-product, a useful source of nitrogen and sulfur soil nutrients, is recovered from the water 
released during lignite gasifi  cation. In an area where water shortages can occur, the relatively large 
amount of water released by lignite gasifi  cation is used for cooling and as boiler feedwater.Oxygen

19.11 NUCLEAR ENERGY
The awesome power of the atom nucleus revealed at the end of World War II held out enormous 
promise for the production of abundant, cheap energy. This promise has never really come to full 
fruition, although nuclear energy currently provides a signifi  cant percentage of electric energy in 
many countries, and it may be the only source of electrical power that can meet world demand with-
out unacceptable environmental degradation, particularly through the generation of greenhouse 
gases. 
Nuclear fi  ssion  for power production is carried out in nuclear power reactors in which the fi  ssion 
(splitting) of uranium-235 or plutonium nuclei occurs. Each such event generates two radioactive 
fi ssion product atoms of roughly half the mass of the nucleus fi  ssioned, an average of 2.5 neutrons, 
plus an enormous amount of energy compared to normal chemical reactions. The neutrons, initially 
released as fast-moving, highly energetic particles, are slowed to thermal energies in a moderator 
medium. For a reactor operating at a steady state, exactly one of the neutron products from each 
fi ssion is used to induce another fi  ssion reaction in a chain reaction (Figure 19.14).
The energy from these nuclear reactions is used to heat water in the reactor core and produce 
steam to drive a steam turbine, as shown in Figure 19.15. As noted in Section 19.4, temperature 
 limitations make nuclear power less effi  cient in converting heat to mechanical energy and, there-
fore, to electricity, than fossil energy conversion processes.
A limitation of fi  ssion reactors is the fact that only 0.71% of natural uranium is fi  ssionable urani-
um-235. This situation could be improved by the development of breeder reactors , which convert 
uranium-238 (natural abundance 99.28%) to fi  ssionable plutonium-239.
A major consideration in the widespread use of nuclear fi  ssion power is the production of large 
quantities of highly radioactive waste products. These remain lethal for thousands of years. They 
must either be stored in a safe place or be disposed of permanently in a safe manner. At the present 
time, spent fuel elements are being stored under water at the reactor sites. Under current regulations 
in most countries, the wastes from this fuel will eventually have to be buried. An alternative favored 
by many investigators is to process the material in the spent fuel elements to remove radioactive 
products from uranium fuel, isolate the relatively short-lived fi  ssion products that decay spontane-
ously within several hundred years, and bombard the longer-lived nuclear wastes with neutrons in 
nuclear reactors. The absorption of neutrons by the nuclei of the nuclear waste elements causes 
transmutation  in which the elements are converted to other elements or fi  ssion products with shorter 
half lives resulting in relatively rapid production of stable isotopes. Radioactive waste elements for 
which transmutation is feasible include plutonium, americium, neptunium, curium, technetium-99, 
and iodine-129. Plutonium, americium, neptunium, and curium are heavy actinide elements that are 
fi ssionable and add fuel value in a nuclear reactor.

Another problem to be faced with nuclear fi  ssion reactors is their eventual decommissioning. 
There are three possible solutions. One is dismantling soon after shutdown, in which the fuel ele-
ments are removed, various components are fl  ushed with cleaning fl  uids, and the reactor is cut up 
by remote control and buried. “Safe storage” involves letting the reactor stand 30–100 years to 
allow for radioactive decay, followed by dismantling. The third alternative is entombment, that is, 
encasing the reactor in a concrete structure.
The course of nuclear power development was altered drastically by two accidents. The fi  rst of 
these occurred on March 28, 1979, with a partial loss of coolant water from the Metropolitan Edison 
Company’s nuclear reactor located on Three Mile Island in the Susquehanna River, 28 miles outside 
of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Known as the TMI incident, the result was a loss of control, overheat-
ing, and partial disintegration of the reactor core. Some radioactive xenon and krypton gases were 
released and some radioactive water was dumped into the Susquehanna River. Eventually the reac-
tor building was sealed. A much worse accident occurred at Chernobyl in the Soviet Union in April 
1986, when a reactor blew up and burned, spreading radioactive debris over a wide area and killing 
a number of people (offi  cially 31, but certainly many more). Thousands of people were evacuated 
and the entire reactor structure had to be entombed in concrete and steel plate. Food was seriously 
contaminated as far away as northern Scandinavia.
As of 2006, 28 years had passed since a new nuclear electric power plant had been ordered in the 
United States, in large part because of the projected high costs of new nuclear plants. Although this 
tends to indicate hard times for the nuclear industry, pronouncements of its demise may be prema-
ture and by 2008, several U.S. utilities had begun the process of ordering new nuclear power plants 
and a signifi  cant number of such plants were under construction around the world. Properly designed 
nuclear fi  ssion reactors can generate large quantities of electricity reliably and safely and have done 
so for decades in U.S. naval submarines and carrier ships and in France, which gets about 80% of 
its electricity from nuclear sources. The single most important factor that may lead to the renais-
sance of nuclear energy is the threat to the atmosphere from greenhouse gases produced in large 
quantities by fossil fuels. It can be argued that nuclear energy is the only proven alternative that can 
provide the amounts of energy required within acceptable limits of cost, reliability, and environ-
mental effects.
New designs for nuclear power plants can enable power reactors that are much safer and environ-
mentally acceptable than those built with older technologies. The proposed new designs incorporate 
built-in passive safety features that work automatically in the event of problems that could lead to

incidents such as TMI or Chernobyl with older reactors. These devices—which depend on passive 
phenomena such as gravity feeding of coolant, evaporation of water, or convection fl  ow of fl  uids—
give the reactor the desirable characteristics of passive stability . They have also enabled signifi  cant 
simplifi  cation of hardware, with only about half as many pumps, pipes, and heat exchangers as are 
contained in older power reactors.
19.11.1 N UCLEAR  FUSION
The fusion of a deuterium nucleus and a tritium nucleus releases a lot of energy as shown below, 
where MeV stands for million electron volts, a unit of energy:
 23 4 1
11 2 0H H He n 17.6 MeV (energy released per fusion)+Æ + + (19.8)
This reaction is responsible for the enormous explosive power of the “hydrogen bomb.” So far it 
has eluded efforts at containment for a practical continuous source of energy. And since physicists 
have been trying to make it work on a practical basis for the last approximately 50 years, it will 
probably never be done. (Within about 15 years after the discovery of the phenomenon of nuclear 
fi ssion, it was being used in a power reactor to power a nuclear submarine.) However, the tantalizing 
possibility of using the essentially limitless supply of deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen, from 
earth’s oceans for nuclear fusion still give some investigators the hope of a practical nuclear fusion 
reactor and some research continues toward that end.
Nuclear fusion was the subject of one of the greatest scientifi  c embarrassments of modern times 
that occurred in 1989. This incident came about when investigators at the University of Utah 
announced that they had accomplished the so-called cold fusion of deuterium during the electrolysis 
of deuterium oxide (heavy water). This resulted in an astonishing fl  urry o f acti vi ty as sci entists 
throughout the world sought to repeat the results, whereas others ridiculed the idea. Unfortunately, 
for the dream of a cheap and abundant source of energy, the skeptics were right, and the whole story 
of cold fusion stands as a lesson in the (temporary) triumph of wishful technological thinking over 
scientifi  c good sense.
19.12 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY
Underground heat in the form of steam, hot water, or hot rock used to produce steam has been 
employed as an energy resource for about a century and can be regarded as largely renewable. This 
energy was fi  rst harnessed for the generation of electricity at Larderello, Italy, in 1904, and has since 
been developed in Japan, Russia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and at the Geysers in northern 
California.
Underground dry steam is relatively rare, but is the most desirable from the standpoint of power 
generation. More commonly, energy reaches the surface as superheated water and steam. In some 
cases, the water is so pure that it can be used for irrigation and livestock; in other cases, it is loaded 
with corrosive, scale-forming salts. Utilization of the heat from contaminated geothermal water 
generally requires that the water be reinjected into the hot formation after heat removal to prevent 
contamination of surface water.
The utilization of hot rocks for energy requires fracturing of the hot formation, followed by 
injection of water and withdrawal of steam. This technology is still in the experimental state, but 
promises approximately 10 times as much energy production as steam and hot water sources.
Land subsidence and seismic effects, such as the mini-earthquakes that occur when water is 
pumped under extreme pressure into hot rock formations that fracture as a consequence, are envi-
ronmental factors that may hinder the development of geothermal power. However, this energy 
source holds considerable promise, and its development continues.Sustainable Energy: The Key to Everything 529
19.13 THE SUN: AN IDEAL, RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCE
Solar power is an ideal source of energy that is unlimited in supply, widely available, and inex-
pensive. It does not add to the earth’s total heat burden or produce chemical air and water pol-
lutants. On a global basis, utilization of only a small fraction of solar energy reaching the earth 
could provide for all energy needs. In the United States, for example, with conversion effi  cien-
cies ranging from 10% to 30%, it would only require collectors ranging in area from one-tenth 
down to one-thirtieth that of the state of Arizona to satisfy present U.S. energy needs. (This is 
still an enormous amount of land, and there are economic and environmental problems related 
to the use of even a fraction of this amount of land for solar energy collection. Certainly, many 
residents of Arizona would not be pleased at having so much of the state covered by solar col-
lectors, and some environmental groups would protest the resultant shading of rattlesnake 
habitat.)
There are vast land areas available in the United States and throughout the world that receive 
exceptional levels of solar energy suitable for power generation. Factors involved in evaluating areas 
for solar energy generation include proximity to the Equator, relatively high altitude, and consistent 
absence of cloud cover. The terrestrial area that has optimum conditions is in the Sahara Desert of 
southeast Niger in Africa, which receives an average of 6.78 kWh/m2 each day, which is close to the 
amount of energy required to heat water for a typical U.S. household.
Solar power cells (photovoltaic cells) for the direct conversion of sunlight to electricity have been 
developed and are widely used for energy in space vehicles. With present technology, however, they 
are relatively expensive in most places for large-scale generation of electricity, although the eco-
nomic gap is narrowing. Most schemes for the utilization of solar power depend on the collection of 
t h e r m a l  e n e r g y  f o l l o w e d  b y  c o n v e r s i o n  t o  e l e c t r i c a l  e n e r g y .  T h e  s i m p l e s t  e x a m p l e  o f  s u c h  a n  
approach involves focusing sunlight on a steam-generating boiler (see Illustration 6 in Figure 19.3). 
Parabolic refl  ectors can be used to focus sunlight on pipes containing heat-transporting fl  uids. 
Selective coatings on these pipes ensure that most of the incident energy is absorbed.
The most effi  cient and reliable type of solar-powered heat engine to generate electricity is the 
Stirling engine , which has achieved close to 30% overall effi  ciency in the conversion of solar energy 
to electricity. The Stirling engine uses hydrogen gas as a working fl  uid in a sealed system in which 
pistons connected by rods in cylinders pump the gas back and forth in the system. The gas is heated 
at a heater head kept at a relatively high temperature by sunlight focused from an array of refl  ective 
mirrors that concentrate sunlight on the heater head . The resultant pressure forces one of the pistons 
down in a power stroke. The gas is then transferred to a piston on the cooled side of the engine 
through a regenerator consisting of a material that captures some of the heat to be used in the next 
cycle, thereby greatly increasing effi  ciency. For a system planned for installation in California’s 
Mojave desert,3 each Stirling unit is rated at 25 kW power, running at 1 800 rpm, and generating 
electricity at 480 V and 60 Hz. A major advantage of this system is its modular character that 
enables scaling from a single unit to a very large number generating hundreds of MW of energy in 
a single location. As of 2008, it appeared that the Stirling system would become a leading contender 
for the utilization of solar power in areas such as California’s Mojave Desert and Africa’s Sahara 
that receive intense, consistent sunlight.
The direct conversion of energy in sunlight to electricity is accomplished by special solar voltaic 
cells. Most types of photovoltaic cells depend on the electronic properties of silicon atoms contain-
ing low levels of other elements. In a typical photovoltaic cell, the cell consists of two layers of sili-
con, a donor layer that is doped with about 1 ppm of arsenic atoms and an acceptor layer that is 
doped with about 1 ppm of boron. Recall from Chapter 3 that Lewis symbols use dots to represent 
the outermost valence electrons of atoms, those that can be lost, gained, or shared in chemical 
bonds. Examination of the Lewis symbols of silicon, arsenic, and boron 
Si B As530 Environmental Chemistry
shows that substitution of an arsenic atom with its 5 valence electrons for a silicon atom with its 4 
valence electrons in the donor layer gives a site with an excess of 1 electron, whereas substitution of 
a boron atom with only 3 electrons for a silicon atom in the acceptor layer gives a site “hole” that is 
defi cient in 1 electron. The surface of a donor layer in contact with an acceptor layer contains elec-
trons that are attracted to the acceptor layer. When light shines on this area, the energy of the pho-
tons of light can push these electrons back onto the donor layer, from which they can go through an 
external circuit back to the acceptor layer, as shown in Figure 19.16. This fl  ow of electrons consti-
tutes an electrical current that can be used for energy.
Solar voltaic cells based on crystalline silicon have operated with a 30% effi  ciency for experi-
mental cells and 15–20% for commercial units available in 2008, at a cost of around 20–25 cents/
kWh, compared to 4–7 cents/kWh for fossil fuel fi  red power plants and 6–9 cents for those fi  red by 
biomass. Part of the high cost results from the fact that the silicon used in the cells must be cut as 
small wafers from silicon crystals for mounting on the cell surfaces. Signifi  cant advances in costs 
and technology are being made with thin-fi  lm photovoltaics, which use an amorphous silicon alloy. 
These cells are only about half as effi  cient as those made with crystalline silicon, but cost only about 
25% as much. A newer approach to the design and construction of amorphous silicon fi  lm photovol-
taic devices uses three layers of amorphous silicon to absorb, successively, short wavelength (“blue”), 
intermediate wavelength (“green”), and long wavelength (“red”) light, as shown in Figure 19.17. 
Thin-fi  lm solar panels constructed with this approach have achieved solar-to-electricity energy con-
version effi  ciencies just over 10%, lower than those using crystalline silicon, but higher than other 
amorphous fi  lm devices. The low cost and relatively high conversion effi  ciencies of these solar pan-
els should enable production of electricity at only about twice the cost of conventional electrical 
power, which would be competitive in some situations.
Systems have been developed in which solar cells lining glass tubes are used to generate electric-
ity. Such a confi  guration is well adapted to rooftops because it captures light from all angles includ-
ing even light from below refl  ected from a white roof. It has been estimated that covering all fl  at 
rooftops in the United States with such collectors could provide about 150 GW of electricity, 15% 
of U.S. consumption.

A major disadvantage of solar energy is its intermittent nature. However, fl  exibility inherent in 
an electric power grid would enable it to accept up to 15% of its total power input from solar energy 
units without special provision for energy storage. Existing hydroelectric facilities may be used for 
pumped-water energy storage in conjunction with solar electricity generation. Heat or cold can be 
stored in water, in a latent form in water (ice) or eutectic salts, or in beds of rock. Enormous amounts 
of heat can be stored in water as a supercritical fl  uid contained at high temperatures and very high 
pressures deep underground. Mechanical energy can be stored with compressed air or fl  ywheels. 
Utilization of solar energy to produce elemental hydrogen as a means to store, transfer, and utilize 
energy, as discussed in Section 19.16, will probably come into widespread use.
No really insurmountable barriers exist to block the development of solar energy, such as might 
be the case with fusion power. In fact, the installation of solar space and water heaters became 
widespread in the late 1970s, and research on solar energy was well supported in the United States 
until after 1980, when it became fashionable to believe that free-market forces had solved the 
“energy crisis.” At present, shortages of energy and concern over the effects of global warming due 
to the use of fossil fuels is leading to much increased interest in solar energy. With the installation 
of more heating devices and the probable development of some cheap, direct solar electrical gener-
ating capacity, it is likely that during the coming century, solar energy will be providing an appre-
ciable percentage of energy needs in areas receiving abundant sunlight.
19.14 ENERGY FROM MOVING AIR AND MOVING WATER
19.14.1 S URPRISING  SUCCESS  OF WIND POWER
Wind power using huge turbines mounted on high towers and coupled to electrical generators is emerg-
ing at a somewhat surprising rate as a source of renewable energy. Although used for centuries with 
windmills that drove grain grinding and water pumping operations and during the early 1900s for 
small-scale electricity generation, especially in remote locations, modern large-scale wind-powered 
electrical generators emerged during the 1990s as economical means of generating electrical power. 
Wind power is completely renewable and nonpolluting. It is an indirect means of utilizing solar energy 
because winds are caused by the movement of air masses heated by the sun (Figure 19.18).
Wind power has become a major factor in world energy generation with an estimated capacity of 
almost 90,000 MW. (A megawatt is abbreviated as MW. Large amounts of power are often expressed Blue light capture

in gigawatts, where 1 GW = 1000 MW. A 1000-MW power plant is considered to be quite large and 
can provide electricity for about 250,000 average U.S. homes. Typical modern large wind turbines 
generate 1.5–4 MW each.) As of the beginning of 2008, the United States had just over 15,500 MW 
of wind power capacity installed with plants in 30 states. As of mid-2007, Texas was the leading 
state for wind energy production in the United States with an installed capacity of 3352 MW and an 
additional 1246 MW under construction. Long the leader in wind energy production, California is 
now second with about 2400 MW. As of 2008, the next fi  ve states were Iowa (1375 MW), Minnesota 
(1350 MW), Washington (1290 MW), Colorado (1065 MW), and Oklahoma (680 MW). Wind 
energy in the United States is now suffi  cient to power 3.9 million average households eliminating as 
much as 25 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.
Wind power has become a major factor in world energy supply. The European Union (EU) coun-
tries have more wind power capacity than the rest of the world combined. By the beginning of 2008, 
EU countries had an installed wind power generation capacity estimated to be around 56,000 MW. 
At the beginning of 2008, the United States was the leading country in wind energy capacity fol-
lowed by Germany, India, Spain, and China. Because of its aggressive program for wind power 
development, China was expected to advance to second within 2 or 3 years. As of 2008, Calgary, 
Canada, had in operation a new $140 million wind electrical power system that powers three-fourth 
of the city’s municipal buildings and provides the energy for the municipal light rail transportation 
system. The system is equivalent to taking 30,000 automobiles off the road.
W i n d  p o w e r  i s  e s p e c i a l l y  a t t r a c t i v e  f o r  s o m e  a g r i c u l t u r a l  r e g i o n s .  O n e  r e a s o n  i s  t h a t  s u c h  
regions often have low population densities so that there are fewer objections to wind power instal-
lations. A commercial wind turbine generating 1.8 MW is a formidable machine, typically mounted 
on to w ers around 80 m hi gh to take ad v an tag e o f hi gher , more cons isten t wind speeds at such 
heights, and may have blades 40 m long. However, the footprints of these structures are relatively 
small and do not occupy much farmland. The electricity is conveyed from the turbines in under-
ground lines eliminating surface power lines. Adding to the potential attractiveness of wind power 
in agricultural regions is the fact that electricity generated by wind energy can be used to electro-
lyze water to produce elemental H2 and O2, an application not handicapped by wind’s intermittent 
nature. The H2 currently required to make NH3 fertilizer is usually produced from steam react-
ing with methane (natural gas), a relatively expensive process, and its production from water by FIGURE 19.18 Wind-powered electrical generators mounted on towers are becoming increasingly com-
mon sights in the world in areas where consistent wind makes this nonpolluting source of renewable energy 
practical.Sustainable Energy: The Key to Everything 533
inexpensive wind energy could help keep the price of ammonia fertilizer at reasonable levels. 
Furthermore, both elemental H2 and O2 can be used to convert crop by-product biomass to hydro-
carbon fuels, as discussed in Section 19.15.
Northern regions, including parts of Alaska, Canada, the Scandinavian countries, and Russia 
often have consistently strong wind conditions conducive to the generation of wind power. Isolation 
from other sources of energy makes wind power attractive for many of these regions. Severe climate 
conditions in these regions pose special challenges for wind generators. One problem can be the 
buildup of rime consisting of ice condensed directly on structures from supercooled fog in air. (In 
warmer regions, the remains of insects zapped by the rotating turbine blades have built up to the 
point of reducing the aerodynamic effi  ciency of the blades.)
Although wind turbines have been growing in size leading to much greater economy in power 
production, there is also a market for small wind turbines that can be used for an individual home 
or commercial building. Small wind turbines have been installed in a number of locations including 
Logan International Airport in Boston and the Brooklyn Naval yard. Although the cost of these 
turbines is much less than that of large commercial turbines, the cost of electricity produced by the 
small turbines is much higher.
19.14.2 E NERGY  FROM MOVING  WATER
Water fl  owing in contact with a device called a waterwheel is one of the oldest sources of power 
other than humans or animals. Grain mills driven by waterpower existed in ancient Greece and 
Rome, and large waterwheels developing up to 50 hp were constructed in the Middle Ages. In colo-
nial North America, waterwheels drove grist mills and sawmills and were further applied to leather, 
textile, and machine shop operations. Because of problems with low water fl  ow in the summer and 
ice formation in the winter, these operations were rapidly displaced when steam engines became 
available in the early 1800s.
With the development of electric power in the late 1800s, waterpower underwent a spectacular 
renaissance to drive electrical generators. The fi  rst practical hydroelectric plant went into operation 
on the Fox River near Appleton, Wisconsin, in 1882. Hydroelectric power grew rapidly as an energy 
source from that time and by 1980 accounted for about 25% of world electrical production and 5% 
of total world energy use. The potential to construct hydroelectric plants is favored by mountainous 
terrain with large river valleys and is distributed relatively evenly around the world. China has about 
one-tenth of the world’s potential for hydroelectric power. About 99% of Norway’s electric power is 
hydroelectric accounting for about 50% of that country’s energy use.
The largest hydroelectric project in the world is the Three Gorges installation on the huge Yangtze 
River in China. Located at the end of a number of steep canyons, the dam spans 2.3 km across the 
river valley and reaches a height of 185 m. When fi  lled, the reservoir formed by the dam will extend 
for 630 km with an average width of 1.3 km. When the dam was fi  nished in 2009, it had 26 generat-
ing units each capable of generating 700 MW of hydroelectric power, a total capacity of 18.2 GW. 
After 2009, six more units are to be constructed in a subterranean powerhouse bringing the total 
generating capacity to 22.4 GW.
The sustainability and environmental acceptability of hydroelectric power present a mixed 
p i c ture .  In  th e  m ode rn  a g e ,  co ns tru c ti o n  o f  w a te r  im po un dm e n ts  te n ds  t o  di s p l ace  s i gnifi  cant

Altering the fl  ow of rivers can change their aquatic ecology. Esthetics can be harmed by fi  lling 
scenic river valleys with impounded water. In some cases in the United States, dams are being 
dismantled to restore river valleys to their former state. However, hydroelectric power prevents 
release of greenhouse gases from equivalent fossil energy-powered plants. Reservoirs can provide 
recreational facilities and serve as sources of fi  sh and water used by municipalities, industries, 
and agriculture.534 Environmental Chemistry
19.14.3 E NERGY  FROM MOVING  WATER WITHOUT  DAMS
A promising approach to the utilization of energy from moving water without building dams is 
provided by hydrokinetic  and wave energy conversion  devices that tap the kinetic energy of moving 
water in river fl  ows, tides, or ocean waves. These devices can be put in natural streams, tidal estuar-
ies, ocean currents, and constructed waterways. One promising device consists of a turbine with 
large blades spaced relatively far apart and connected directly to a generator that can be placed in a 
water current, such as in a river. Such turbines can be attached directly to structures constructed on 
waterway beds or can be attached to bridge supports. Bidirectional turbines have been designed for 
use in tidal currents that fl  ow back and forth.
19.15 BIOMASS ENERGY
Fossil fuels originally came from photosynthetic processes. Photosynthesis is a promising source 
of combustible chemicals to be used for energy production including transportation fuels4 and 
could certainly produce all needed organic raw materials to substitute for petroleum in the current 
petrochemicals industry. It suffers from the disadvantage of being a very ineffi  cient means of solar 
energy collection (a collection effi  ciency of only a fraction of a percent by photosynthesis is typical 
of most common plants). However, the overall energy conversion effi  ciency of several plants, such 
a s  s u g a r c a n e ,  i s  a r o u n d  0 . 6 % .  F u rt h e r m o r e ,  s o m e  p l a n t s ,  s u c h  a s  Euphorbia lathyrus  (gopher 
plant), a small bush growing wild in California, produce hydrocarbon emulsions directly. The fruit 
of the Philippine plant, Pittsosporum reiniferum , can be burned for illumination due to its high 
content of hydrocarbon terpenes, primarily a-pinene and myrcene. Conversion of agricultural 
plant residues to energy could be employed to provide much of the energy required for agricultural 
production. Indeed, until about 80 years ago, virtually all of the energy required in agriculture—
hay and oats for horses, home-grown food for laborers, and wood for home heating—originated 
from plant materials produced on the land. (An interesting exercise is to calculate the number of 
horses required to provide the energy used for transportation at the present time in the Los Angeles 
basin. It can be shown that such a large number of horses would fi  ll the entire basin with manure 
at a rate of several feet per day.)
Annual world production of biomass is estimated at 146 billion metric tons, mostly from 
uncontrolled plant growth. Many farm crops and trees can produce around 2 metric tons per acre 
per year of dry biomass, and some algae and grasses can produce signifi  cantly more. The heating 
value of this biomass is 5000–8000 Btu/lb about half of typical values for coal. However, bio-
mass contains virtually no ash or sulfur, both problems with coal. Another sustainability advan-
tage of biomass is that all of the carbon in it is taken from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere so 
that biomass combustion does not add any net quantities of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. 
Indeed, use of biomass to produce hydrogen-rich methane or elemental hydrogen along with 
sequestration of by-product carbon dioxide would result in an overall loss of carbon dioxide from 
the atmosphere.
As it has been throughout history, biomass is signifi  cant as heating fuel, and in some parts of the 
world is the fuel most widely used for cooking. Scavenging wood for cooking fuel has been a major 
contributor to deforestation in some areas. About 15% of Finland’s energy needs are provided by 
wood and wood products (including black liquor by-product from pulp and paper manufacture), 
about one-third of which is from solid wood. Despite the charm of a wood fi  re and the sometimes 
pleasant odor of wood smoke, air pollution from wood-burning stoves and furnaces is a signifi  cant 
problem in some areas. Currently, wood provides about 8% of world energy needs. This percentage 
could increase through the development of energy plantations consisting of trees grown solely for 
their energy content.
Biomass could be used to replace much of the 100 million metric tons of petroleum and natural 
gas currently consumed in the manufacture of primary chemicals in the world each year. Among Sustainable Energy: The Key to Everything 535
the sources of biomass that could be used for chemical production are grains and sugar crops 
(for ethanol manufacture), oilseeds, animal by-products, manure, and sewage (the last two for meth-
ane generation). The biggest potential source of chemicals is the lignocellulose making up the bulk 
of most plant material (see below).
19.15.1 E THANOL  FUEL
A major option for converting photosynthetically produced biochemical energy to forms suitable for 
internal combustion engines is the production of ethanol, C2H6O, by the fermentation of sugars from 
biomass. Suitably designed internal combustion engines can burn pure ethanol or a mixture of 85% 
ethanol and 15% gasoline called E85. More commonly, ethanol is blended in proportions of around 
10% with gasoline to give gasohol , a fuel that can be used in existing internal combustion engines 
with little or no adjustment.
Gasohol boosts octane rating and reduces emissions of carbon monoxide. From a resource view-
point, because of its photosynthetic origin, alcohol may be considered a renewable resource rather 
than a depletable fossil fuel. Ethanol is most commonly produced biochemically by the fermentation 
of carbohydrates. Brazil, a country that produces copious amounts of fermentable sugar from sug-
arcane, has been a leader in the manufacture of ethanol for fuel uses, with about 16 billion liters 
produced in 2006. All motor fuels in Brazil contain at least 24% ethanol and some fuel is essentially 
pure ethanol. A signifi  cant fraction of the gasoline consumed in the United States is supplemented 
with ethanol.
Although most of the ethanol that has been produced for fuel has been made from the fermenta-
tion of grain or sugar, there is legitimate concern that, considering the energy that goes into produc-
ing grain ethanol, there is no net energy gain. A potentially much more abundant and cheaper 
source of ethanol consists of biomass generated as a by-product of crop production including straw 
from wheat or rice production or cornstalks from growing corn. In the past, much rice straw from 
commercial production in the United States was simply burned to save the cost of cultivating it back 
into the soil. Straw cannot be fermented directly, but must be broken down to hexose and pentose 
sugars for fermentation. This has traditionally been done with acid treatment, which is expensive, 
although technologies exist for recycling acid. It is now generally agreed that production of ethanol 
from plant biomass by-products will require enzymatic hydrolysis with cellulase enzyme to produce 
the required sugars. The Canadian Iogen Corporation has a means for obtaining fermentable sugars 
from wheat straw and other plant materials and has attempted to develop a cost-effective commer-
cial process.
19.15.2 B IODIESEL  FUEL
Biodiesel fuel  is a growing source of renewable liquid hydrocarbon fuels. Unlike fuel ethanol, 
which must be transported in corrosion-resistant truck tanker trailers or railroad tankers, biodiesel 
fuel is readily moved through existing pipelines. Rudolf Diesel developed the high-compression, 
compression-ignited diesel engine in the late 1800s and fi  rst operated the engine in Augsburg, 
Germany, in 1893. He demonstrated his invention at the World Fair in Paris in 1900, receiving the 
“Grand Prix” (highest prize) for his invention. Interestingly, the fuel used in this and other demon-
strations of Diesel’s engine was peanut oil, and vegetable oils were the main source of fuel for diesel 
engines during the fi  rst two decades of their use.
Vegetable oils were eventually replaced by petroleum-based hydrocarbons. More recently, diesel 
fuels that are derivatives of the fatty acids in the oils have been synthesized from vegetable oil feed-
stocks. Vegetable oils from soybeans and other biological sources are used to make biodiesel fuel as 
discussed below.
Vegetable oils are fatty acid esters of glycerol, a three-carbon alcohol with 3-OH groups attached. 
To produce biodiesel fuel, the glycerol esters are hydrolyzed by strong base (NaOH) in the presence 536 Environmental Chemistry
of methanol alcohol (HOCH3) and the fatty acids are converted to their methyl esters, the molecules 
composing biodiesel fuel:

In this reaction, R stands for a long hydrocarbon chain in one of a number of fatty acids including 
stearic acid, linoleic acid, oleic acid, lauric acid, and behenic acid. For example, in stearic acid, R is 
a straight chain with 17 carbon atoms, C17H35.
Major oils that are used for biodiesel fuel production are rapeseed, sunfl  ower, soybean, palm, 
coconut, and jatropha. Rapeseed, long grown for animal feed, is the largest source of oil for bio-
diesel manufacture and is widely produced in Europe, whereas soybean oil predominates in the 
United States. Both of these oils offer the advantage of providing a protein-rich animal feed after 
the oil has been squeezed from the seed. Palm oil, and to a lesser extent, coconut oil (from coco-
nut trees) and jatropha (from Jatropha curcus , planted for hedges) are attractive because they are 
from perennial plants that thrive in the tropics. (In late 2008, Air New Zealand fl  ew a Boeing 747 
aircraft on which one engine was fueled with 50% jatropha-derived fuel and 50% conventional jet 
fuel; the aircraft had three other engines in case the experiment failed.) By 2009, the explosive 
growth of palm oil tree plantations in Malaysia and Indonesia was resulting in high levels of rain 
forest destruction.
An interesting possibility for biodiesel fuel production is algae that have an oil content exceeding 
50%. Such algae can grow profusely in ponds fed with nutrient-rich effl  uent from wastewater treat-
ment plants. Oil-producing algae have also been grown in the carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere pro-
vided by power plant stack gases. By growing algae in treated wastewater within a carbon-dioxide-rich 
atmosphere from power plants, nutrients can be removed from wastewater, thus reducing eutrophication 
in receiving waters, and some of the carbon dioxide can be removed from stack gas emissions.
The potential productivity of algae for biomass fuel production is spectacular. Whereas soybean 
and palm oil sources typically produce, respectively, up to 200 and 2500 L/acre annually of biodie-
sel fuel, algae have the potential to yield as much as 40,000 L/acre/year of the fuel. Furthermore, 
with adequate supplies of water, algae can be grown on desert lands that are unsuitable for growing 
soil-based crops. One experimental system grows algae in water that circulates through transparent 
plastic tubes. Some algae thrive in saltwater, which can come from the sea or underground forma-
tions bearing brackish water.
19.15.3 U NREALIZED  POTENTIAL  OF LIGNOCELLULOSE  FUELS
Both grain- and sugar-based ethanol as well as vegetable oils used to make biodiesel fuel are not the 
best candidates for biomaterial fuels because they use only relatively small fractions of the plants 
consisting of the parts that have the most value for food, animal feed, and raw materials. A much 
more abundant source of fuel consists of the lignocellulose  parts of plants, a material composed of 
large polymeric molecules with an approximate empirical formula of CH2O that composes the 
structural members of plants including tree wood, stalks, straw, corncobs, and leaves. The three 
major components of lignocellulose and their approximate empirical formulas are cellulose/starch, 
[C6(H2O)5)]n; hemicellulose, [C5(H2O)4)]n; and lignin, [C10(H12O)3)]n. 
Large amounts of crop by-product biomass are generated annually. Assuming conservatively that 
t h e  a m o u n t  o f  t h i s  m a t e r i a l  a v a i l a b l e  i n  t h e  U n i t e d  S t a t e s  i s  e q u a l  t o  t h e  m a s s  o f  c o r n  g r a i n  Sustainable Energy: The Key to Everything 537
 produced, about 230 million tons of crop by-product biomass could be made available for fuel each 
year; the actual fi  gure might be much higher.
The amount of biomass that could be generated from dedicated trees and grass is very high, 
an estimated 2240 million tons per year in the United States alone. A major advantage of this 
source is that it comes from perennial plants that can be grown on erodable land, much of which 
has been taken from agricultural production as the result of government programs. One of the 
p l a n t s  t h a t  i s  r e m a r k a b l y  p r o d u c t i v e  o f  b i o m a s s  c o n s i s t s  o f  h y b r i d  p o p l a r s ,  f r o m  t h e  g e n u s  
Populis  that includes cottonwoods and aspens. These trees may grow more than 2 m/year and 
will establish new growth from the stumps of harvested trees, retaining their root systems that 
prevent soil erosion.
The grass most commonly considered for its biomass productivity is switchgrass. Native to North 
America, switchgrass is disease- and pest-resistant and requires little fertilizer. It tolerates both 
drought and fl  ooding very well. Upland varieties of switchgrass grow up to 2 m tall in one growing 
season on well-drained soils. Lowland varieties can reach heights of 4 m and grow best on heavy 
soils in bottomlands. Improved varieties of switchgrass have been developed for animal forage and 
yield around 8 tons/acre of biomass each year. Average biomass yields of forests are only about half 
as high.
Another high-yielding grass native to swampy regions, such as the Florida everglades, is sawgrass 
(Cladium jamaicense ), which gets its name from the saw-like serrations on its leaves. It is well adapted 
to cultivation in wet areas where other crops cannot be grown and has the additional advantage of 
providing good wildlife cover.
There are numerous pathways by which biomass and biowastes (including sewage and animal 
wastes) can be converted to energy, fuels, and feedstocks. These are the following:
Direct combustion to produce heat and to raise steam to generate electricity• 
Fermentation to produce ethanol (from sugar) or methane• 
Pyrolysis to yield gaseous fuels (particularly methane), liquids (including hydrocarbons • 
and oxygenated species), and solid carbon
Thermochemical gasifi  cation to produce CO, H • 2, CH4, by-product liquids, and solid 
carbon
Fischer–Tropsch synthesis of hydrocarbons from CO and H• 2 derived from biomass
Hydrogenation of oxygenated liquids from biomass to produce hydrocarbons• 
Methyl esterifi  cation of oils to produce methyl ester biodiesel fuels • 
Sustainable preparation of biofuels from biomass makes it desirable to recover nutrients such as 
phosphorus and potassium from the biomass during processing.
Biomass can be used directly as a fuel with a heating value on a dry mass basis about half that of 
coal. It is extremely low in sulfur and ash and its mineral ash components do not contain toxic ele-
ments, such as the arsenic that occurs in some coals. The most direct way to use biomass fuel is 
direct combustion to produce heat. Biomass can be converted to other high-value fuels including 
hydrocarbons by gasifi  cation. One approach to biomass gasifi  cation begins with combustion of part 
of the biomass (represented by the formula {CH2O}) with pure molecular oxygen oxidant (to avoid 
diluting the product gas with N2 from air),
 {CH2O} + O2 Æ CO2 + H2O + heat (19.10)
yielding heat required for the rest of the gasifi  cation process. Under the oxygen-defi  cient conditions 
through which gasifi  cation is carried out, part of the biomass is partially oxidized to combustible 
carbon monoxide, CO: 
 1
22 2 2 {CH O} O CO H O heat +Æ ++ (19.11)538 Environmental Chemistry
Part of the biomass is pyrolyzed by the heat produced by Reaction 19.10
 {CH2O} + heat Æ C + H2O (19.12)
yielding hot carbon and combustible gaseous and liquid by-products. The hot carbon reacts with 
steam,
 C + H2O + heat Æ CO + H2 (19.13)
yielding a synthesis gas  mixture of CO and H2. Biomass may also react as it is heated,
 {CH2O} + heat Æ CO + H2 (19.14)
yielding synthesis gas. The carbon monoxide in synthesis gas can be subjected to the water-gas shift 
reaction, 
 CO + H2O Æ CO2 + H2 (19.15)
giving elemental H2 as the only gaseous product. The CO2 generated in Reactions 19.10 and 19.15 
can be separated and sequestered, such as by pumping into underground petroleum formations to 
enable recovery of petroleum, thereby preventing the release of this greenhouse-warming gas to the 
atmosphere. 
Elemental hydrogen can be used as an end product of biomass gasifi  cation directly as a fuel in 
gas turbines and other heat engines or to generate electricity in fuel cells. Elemental hydrogen can 
be used to synthesize ammonia, NH3, an important industrial chemical and fertilizer. A mixture of 
CO and H2 can be reacted over a catalyst in a methanation reaction
 CO + 3H2 Æ CH4 + H2O (19.16)
to produce methane, which, made by this method, is called synthetic natural gas  (SNG). With dif-
ferent proportions of hydrogen and CO reactants and a different catalyst, a mixture of CO and H2 
can react according to the Fischer–Tropsch reaction to yield a variety of hydrocarbons including 
gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel fuel as shown by the reaction below for the synthesis of octane, one of 
the hydrocarbons in gasoline: 
 8CO + 17H2 Æ C8H18 + 8H2O (19.17)
A similar reaction can also be used to make ethanol and methanol, CH3OH, which can be used 
as a fuel, gasoline additive, and to produce H2 for fuel cells in vehicles.
An interesting possibility for increasing the amount of hydrocarbon fuel that can be obtained 
from biomass is to use H2 and O2 produced by the electrolysis of water with electricity generated by 
wind power,
 2H2O + electrical energy Æ 2H2(g) + O2(g) (19.18)
to react with biomass for gasifi  cation. The pure elemental oxygen can be used to produce energy 
from biomass as shown by Reaction 19.10 without diluting the gas product with elemental nitrogen, 
N2, as would be the case with air oxidant, and enabling sequestration of the CO2 product. The ele-
mental hydrogen generated by electrolysis of water can be reacted directly with biomass. Ideally , Sustainable Energy: The Key to Everything 539
direct hydrogenation of biomass would produce predominantly hydrocarbons, such as methane gen-
erated by the following reaction:
 {CH2O} + 2H2 Æ CH4 + H2O (19.19)
More commonly, hydrogenation produces a mixture of many liquids, most of which contain 
oxygen in compounds such as ethers, alcohols, and ketones. For fuel use, these compounds must be 
further treated with hydrogen to remove oxygen and leave hydrocarbon liquids. Such a process as 
outlined above provides a means for using the energy originally generated by windpower to make a 
high-energy hydrocarbon fuel that can be used for transportation or other purposes.
19.15.4 B IOGAS
A signifi  cant source of clean-burning methane can be obtained from the anoxic (oxygen-free) 
 bacterial fermentation of biomass of a variety of kinds. Representing biomass as {CH2O}, the 
 biochemical reaction is the following: 
 2{CH2O} Æ CH4 + CO2 (19.20)
This reaction has long been used in the anoxic digesters of sewage treatment plants to reduce the 
amount of degradable organic matter in excess sewage sludge. Such a well-balanced plant makes 
enough methane to provide for all its energy needs. Large livestock feeding operations may have 
digesters to produce methane from livestock manure and other biological wastes associated with the 
feeding operation. Another source of methane generated by anoxic fermentation is obtained by 
burying collector pipes in mounds of municipal solid wastes and collecting the off-gas.
An outstanding example of “grass roots” energy sustainability is provided by the widespread use 
of biogas generators in rural China, an area chronically short of fuel. The Chinese have built millions 
of anoxic digesters located just below the ground surface in which all kinds of biomass including 
animal wastes, human excrement, and vegetable and crop wastes are degraded in the absence of air 
to produce combustible methane gas. The digesters are usually located in proximity to dwellings and 
to sources of waste, including latrines and pigsties. Covered by a thin layer of soil, these facilities take 
advantage of solar heating to accelerate fermentation. In addition to producing fuel, anoxic digestion 
alleviates waste disposal and health problems through the destruction of pathogens in the waste by 
the fermentation process, which often takes place at a somewhat elevated temperature that kills most 
pathogenic organisms. An additional advantage is that the fertilizer value of the wastes is conserved 
so that residues from the digesters can be placed on soil to serve as fertilizer for crops without much 
concern over spreading pathogens. The contents of both nitrogen and phosphorus in the digester resi-
dues are much higher than in biomass that has been treated by mulching in an air environment.
The gas from the Chinese biogas facilities is used largely for cooking and lamps. In larger instal-
lations, internal combustion engines have been adapted to run in part on biogas. In the case of gaso-
line engines, biogas is fed into carburetors through an adjustable feed valve and in the case of diesel 
engines, it is fed into the air/fuel intake manifold to supplement the minimal amount of diesel fuel 
injected into the combustion chamber to initiate combustion during engine operation.
A major methane-generating system in the United States is overseen by Central Vermont Public 
Service in Vermont, utilizing manure from several large dairy farms. The largest dairy in this 
 complex is the Pleasant Valley Farm where 1500 milking cows produce over 40 million pounds of 
milk a year. As a profi  table by-product of this operation, anoxic fermentation for 3 weeks of manure 
from the cows produces methane used to generate 3.5 million kWh of electricity a year, enough to 
power 500 homes. The farm went from spending about $200/day for electricity to making about 
$1200/day from renewable electricity sales in 2008. The system cost about $2 million. As of late 
2008, Central Vermont Public Service had fi  ve farms with a total of about 5000 cows in its “Cow 
Power” renewable energy program.540 Environmental Chemistry
19.16 HYDROGEN AS A MEANS TO STORE AND UTILIZE ENERGY
Hydrogen gas, H2, is an ideal chemical fuel in some respects that may serve as a storage medium for 
solar energy. There are several ways to generate elemental hydrogen.5 As noted in the preceding 
section, solar-generated electricity can be used to electrolyze water:
 2H2O + electrical energy Æ 2H2(g) + O2(g) (19.21)
The hydrogen fuel product, and even elemental oxygen produced as an electrolysis by-product, 
can be piped some distance and the hydrogen burned without pollution, or it may be used in a fuel 
cell (Figure 19.7). This may, in fact, make possible a “hydrogen economy.” Disadvantages of using 
hydrogen as a fuel include its low heating value per unit volume and the wide range of explosive 
mixtures it forms with air. Although not yet economical, photochemical processes can be used to 
split water to H2 and O2 that can be used to power fuel cells.
Fuel-cell-powered vehicles are now practical in some applications and Honda began production 
of the fi  rst commercial fuel-cell automobile in 2008. One of the greatest barriers to their widespread 
adoption has been their inability to carry suffi  cient hydrogen for an acceptable range. Several solu-
tions to this problem are now being investigated. One is the potentially problematic use of very cold 
liquid hydrogen as a fuel source. Another is the use of very high pressure containers composed of 
multilayer cylinders wrapped with carbon composite and fi  lled with hydrogen at pressures up to 
10,000 psi (about 670  ¥ atmospheric pressure!), reputed to contain suffi  cient hydrogen to propel an 
automobile up to 300 miles. Other systems use catalysts to break down liquid fuels, such as metha-
nol or gasoline, to generate hydrogen for fuel cells.
Although there has been much enthusiasm in some quarters for hydrogen fuel and predictions of 
a new hydrogen economy, some of the more enthusiastic arguments for hydrogen fuel may be too 
optimistic. The most important point is that, unlike fossil fuels, hydrogen is not a primary source of 
energy and has to be made by processes such as the electrolysis of water (Reaction 19.18) that use 
other sources of energy. Most of the 6 million tons of elemental hydrogen used in the United States 
each year is made from steam reforming of methane from natural gas: 
 CH4 + H2O Æ 3H2 + CO (19.22)
The carbon monoxide product can be reacted with steam as noted in the preceding section,
 CO + H2O Æ CO2 + H2 (19.23)
to produce additional H2 and the CO2 product of this reaction can be sequestered as discussed in 
Section 19.9. 
In principle, the process described above and the utilization of elemental hydrogen in fuel cells 
can provide a transport fuel that is pollution-free. However, methane gas is easier to store than ele-
m e n tal  h y dr o g e n  an d  th e  m o d e rn  in te rn al  c o m b u s ti o n  e n gin e  w i th  as s oc i a ted  e mi s s i o n s  c o n tr o l  
equipment is virtually pollution-free. So the intermediate production of elemental hydrogen is 
unlike l y to be the greenest approach. Producti on o f e lemental h y dro g en b y e lectro l y sis o f w ater 
using electricity from renewable sources, such as photovoltaics and windpower, is essentially non-
polluting, but it requires balancing the relatively ineffi  cient electrolysis process against the value of 
the electricity that it consumes.
19.17 COMBINED POWER CYCLES
Combined power cycles  enable much more effi  cient utilization of combustible fuels by fi  rst using 
the heat of combustion in a turbine coupled to an electrical generator, raising steam in a boiler Sustainable Energy: The Key to Everything 541
with the hot exhaust gas from this turbine, using the steam to power a second turbine linked to a 
generator, and fi  nally using the steam and hot water from the steam turbine for applications such 
as processing in the chemical industry, heating commercial buildings, or heating homes. A sche-
matic diagram of a combined power cycle system is illustrated in Figure 19.19. The water con-
densed from the steam used for heating is pure and is recycled to the boiler, thus minimizing the 
amount of makeup boiler feedwater, which requires expensive treatment to make it suitable for 
use in boilers. The use of steam leaving a steam turbine for heating, a concept known as district 
heating , is commonly practiced in Europe (and many university campuses in the United States) 
and can save large amounts of fuel otherwise required for heating. Such a system as the one 
described is in keeping with the best practice of industrial ecology and should be employed when-
ever it is practical to do so.
19.18 A SYSTEM OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY FOR METHANE PRODUCTION
Figure 19.20 illustrates an industrial ecosystem based on the production of methane fuel from 
renewable biomass and wind energy sources. Methane is the ideal clean-burning fuel for virtually 
all applications that currently use fossil fuels except for aircraft. With hybrid automobile technol-
ogy, methane can be used as motor fuel giving an acceptable range between refueling. With previ-
ously untapped sources coming on line in the United States and a number of other countries, 
methane is relatively available and inexpensive. Pipeline systems are in place for its distribution. 
And, when methane sources are eventually exhausted, the gas can be synthesized from biomass and 
elemental hydrogen produced from the electrolysis of water.

nected to an electrical generator. The hot gases from this turbine are fed to a boiler to raise steam, which drives 
a steam turbine, also connected to a generator. The still hot exhaust steam from the steam turbine is used for 
process heat or conveyed to commercial or residential buildings for heating. The water condensed from the 
steam in this fi  nal application is returned to the power plant to generate more steam, thus conserving water and 
avoiding the necessity to treat more water to the high purity standards required by the boiler.542 Environmental Chemistry
A system for producing methane renewably is outlined in Figure 19.20. Biomass is used as a 
source of fi  xed carbon that is reacted with elemental hydrogen made by electrolyzing water using 
renewable wind energy. Another source of methane in the system is anoxic fermentation of wastes, 
including sewage. Instead of municipal refuse in the community being disposed in landfi  ll, it is fi  rst 
subjected to anoxic fermentation to generate methane after which the residues are thermochemi-
cally gasifi  ed to provide feedstock for chemical synthesis. Other aspects of the system are largely 
self-explanatory from the fi  gure.

of Hazardous Wastes
20.1 INTRODUCTION
A hazardous substance  i s  a  m a t e ri a l  t h a t  m a y  p o s e  a  d a n g e r  t o  l i v i n g  o r g a n i s m s ,  m a t e ri a l s ,  
 structures, or the environment by explosion or fi  re hazards, corrosion, toxicity to organisms, or 
other detrimental effects. What, then, is a hazardous waste? A simple defi  nition of a hazardous 
waste  is that it is a hazardous substance that has been discarded, abandoned, neglected, released 
or designated as a waste material, or one that may interact with other substances to be hazardous. 
The defi  nition of hazardous waste is addressed in greater detail in Section 20.2, but in a simple 
sense it is a material that has been left where it should not be and that may cause harm to one if 
one encounters it. 
20.1.1 H ISTORY  OF HAZARDOUS  SUBSTANCES
Humans have always been exposed to hazardous substances, going back to prehistoric times when 
they inhaled noxious volcanic gases or succumbed to carbon monoxide from inadequately vented 
fi res in cave dwellings sealed too well against Ice-Age cold. Slaves in Ancient Greece developed 
lung disease from weaving mineral asbestos fi  bers into cloth to make it more degradation resistant. 
Some archaeological and historical studies have concluded that lead wine containers were a leading 
cause of lead poisoning in the more affl  uent ruling class of the Roman Empire, leading to erratic 
be ha vi o r  s u c h  as  fi  xation on spectacular sporting events, chronic unmanageable budget defi  cits, 
speculative purchases of overvalued stock, illicit trysts in governmental offi  ces, and ill-conceived, 
o v e r l y  am b i ti o u s  mili tary  v e n tur e s  in  r e m o t e  f o r e i gn  l an d s .  Al c h e mi s t s  w h o  w o r k ed  d urin g  th e  
Middle Ages often suffered debilitating injuries and illnesses resulting from the hazards of their 
explosive and toxic chemicals. During the 1700s, runoff from mine spoils piles began to create seri-
ous contamination problems in Europe. As the production of dyes and other organic chemicals 
developed from the coal tar industry in Germany during the 1800s, pollution and poisoning from 
coal tar by-products were observed. By around 1900, the quantity and variety of chemical wastes 
produced each year were increasing sharply with the addition of wastes such as spent steel and iron 
pickling liquor, lead battery wastes, chromic wastes, petroleum refi  nery wastes, radium wastes, and 
fl uoride wastes from aluminum ore refi  ning. As the century progressed into the World War II era, 
the wastes and hazardous by-products of manufacturing increased markedly from sources such as 
chlorinated solvents manufacture, pesticides synthesis, polymers manufacture, plastics, paints, and 
wood preservatives.
The Love Canal affair of the 1970s and 1980s brought hazardous wastes to public attention as a 
major political issue in the United States. Starting around 1940, this site in Niagara Falls, New York, 
had received about 20,000 metric tons of chemical wastes containing at least 80 different chemicals. 546 Environmental Chemistry
By 1994, state and federal governments had spent well over $100 million to clean up the site and 
relocate residents.
Other areas containing hazardous wastes that received attention included an industrial site in 
Woburn, Massachusetts, that had been contaminated by wastes from tanneries, glue-making facto-
ries, and chemical companies dating back to about 1850; the Stringfellow Acid Pits near Riverside, 
California; the Valley of the Drums in Kentucky; and Times Beach, Missouri, an entire town that 
was abandoned because of contamination by TCDD (dioxin).
The problem of hazardous wastes is truly international in scope. As a result of the problem of 
dumping such wastes in developing countries, the 1989 Basel Convention on the Control of 
Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal was held in Basel, Switzerland 
in 1989, and has since been signed by more than 100 countries. This treaty defi  nes a long List A 
of hazardous wastes, a List B of nonhazardous wastes, and a List C of as yet unclassifi  ed materials. 
An example of a material on List C is PVC-coated wire, which is harmless, itself, but may release 
dioxins or heavy metals when thermally treated. 
Actions subsequent to the Basel Convention have dealt with specifi  c kinds of wastes. One of 
these consists of persistent organic pollutants (POP) addressed by the Stockholm Convention on 
Persistent Organic Pollutants of 2001. POP are organic compounds or mixtures including pesti-
cides, industrial products, and  manufacturing by-products that persist in the environment because 
of their resistance to physical, chemical, and biological processes. Those targeted for elimination in 
their production and use are aldrin, chlordane, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene 
(HCB), mirex, toxaphene, and PCBs. The production and use of DDT are to be restricted. Targeted 
for minimization and ultimate elimination are manufacturing by-product PCBs, dibenzo- p-dioxins, 
and dibenzofurans.
Rapidly developing industrial economies normally have growing problems with hazardous 
wastes. During the 1990s and early 2000s, this was particularly true of the rapidly growing econo-
mies of highly populous China and India. By 2005, China was reported to be generating about 
900 million metric tons of industrial solid wastes each year of which 10.6 million metric tons were 
classifi  ed as hazardous waste.1
20.1.2 L EGISLATION
Governments in a number of nations have passed legislation to deal with hazardous substances and 
wastes. In the United States such legislation has included the following:
Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) of 1976• 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976 [amended and reauthorized by • 
the Hazardous and Solid Wastes Amendments Act (HSWA) of 1984]
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) • 
of 1980
RCRA legislation charged the U.S. EPA with protecting human health and the environment from 
improper management and disposal of hazardous wastes by issuing and enforcing regulations 
pertaining to such wastes. RCRA requires that hazardous wastes and their characteristics be 
listed and controlled from the time of their origin until their proper disposal or destruction. 
Regulations pertaining to fi  rms generating and transporting hazardous wastes require that they 
keep detailed records, including reports on their activities and manifests to ensure proper track-
ing of hazardous wastes through transportation systems. Approved containers and labels must be 
used, and wastes can only be delivered to facilities approved for treatment, storage, and disposal. 
In 2007, almost 47 million tons of RCRA-regulated wastes were reported from 16,349 generators 
in the United States. About 3000 facilities are involved in the treatment, storage, or disposal of 
RCRA wastes. Nature, Sources, and Environmental Chemistry of Hazardous Wastes 547
CERCLA (Superfund) legislation deals with actual or potential releases of hazardous materials 
that have the potential to endanger people or the surrounding environment at uncontrolled or 
 abandoned hazardous waste sites in the United States. The act requires responsible parties or the 
government to clean up waste sites. Among CERCLA’s major purposes are the following:
Site identifi  cation • 
Evaluation of danger from waste sites• 
Evaluation of damages to natural resources• 
Monitoring of release of hazardous substances from sites• 
Removal or cleanup of wastes by responsible parties or government• 
CERCLA was extended for fi  ve years by the passage of the Superfund Amendments and 
Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986, legislation with greatly increased scope and additional 
funding. Actually longer than CERCLA, SARA encouraged the development of alternatives to 
land disposal that favor permanent solutions reducing volume, mobility, and toxicity of wastes; 
increased emphasis upon public health, research, training, and state and citizen involvement; 
and establishment of a new program for leaking underground (petroleum) storage tanks. After 
1986, few new legislative initiatives dealing with hazardous wastes were forthcoming in the 
United States.
During the earlier years of Superfund, it was funded by taxes levied on corporations that used, 
disposed of, or profi  ted from toxic and hazardous chemicals. Since 1995, Congress has refused to 
renew these fees and a $3.8 billion surplus in the fund was gradually used up, running dry in 2003. 
Funding from general revenues and from fi  nes levied against parties found responsible for improper 
waste disposal has kept the Superfund cleanup program going, but at a decreased rate. A total of 
$1.8 billion was spent on Superfund projects in the United States in 1999 and that fi  gure dropped to 
$1.3 billion in 2007. Since 1980, the Superfund program has placed around 1600 waste sites on the 
National Priorities list designated for priority cleanup. Of these, somewhat more than 300 have been 
completely cleaned up and delisted and the majority of cleanup has been completed at somewhat 
more than 700 of the sites. Work was completed at a rate of about 75 sites per year during the 1990s, 
but has now dropped to about half that level.
20.2 CLASSIFICATION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND WASTES
Many specifi  c chemicals in widespread use are hazardous because of their chemical reactivities, fi  re 
hazards, toxicities, and other properties. There are numerous kinds of hazardous substances, usually 
consisting of mixtures of specifi  c chemicals. These include such things as explosives; fl  ammable 
liquids; fl  ammable solids, such as magnesium metal and sodium hydride; oxidizing materials; such 
a s  p e r o x i d e s ;  c o rr o s i v e  m a t e ri al s ,  s u c h  a s  s tr o n g  a c i d s ;  e t i o l o g i c  a g e n t s  t h a t  c a u s e  d i s e a s e ;  an d  
radioactive materials.
20.2.1 C HARACTERISTICS  AND LISTED WASTES
For regulatory and legal purposes in the United States, hazardous substances are listed specifi  cally 
and are defi  ned according to general characteristics. Under the authority of the RCRA, the U.S. EEPA 
defi nes hazardous substances in terms of the following characteristics:
Ignitability• , characteristic of substances that are liquids, the vapors of which are likely to 
ignite in the presence of ignition sources; nonliquids that may catch fi  re from friction or 
contact with water and which burn vigorously or persistently; ignitable compressed gases; 
and oxidizers548 Environmental Chemistry
Corrosivity• , characteristic of substances that exhibit extremes of acidity or basicity or a 
tendency to corrode steel
Reactivity• , characteristic of substances that have a tendency to undergo violent chemical 
chang e ( e . g . , e xp l osi v es, p yrophori c materials, w ater -reacti v e substances, or cy ani de- or 
sulfi de-bearing wastes)
Toxicity• , defi  ned in terms of a standard extraction procedure followed by chemical analysis 
for specifi  c substances
In addition to classifi  cation by characteristics, EPA designates more than 450 listed wastes , which 
are specifi  c substances or c lasses o f substances kno wn to be hazardous. Each such substance is 
assigned an EPA hazardous waste number  in the format of a letter followed by three numerals, 
where a different letter is assigned to substances from each of the four following lists:
F-type wastes from nonspecifi  c sources• : For example, quenching wastewater treatment 
sludges from metal heat treating operations where cyanides are used in the process (F012).
K-type wastes from specifi  c sources• : For example, heavy ends from the distillation of 
 ethylene dichloride in ethylene dichloride production (K019).
P-type acute hazardous wastes• : Wastes that have been found to be fatal to humans in low 
doses, or capable of causing or signifi  cantly contributing to an increase in serious irrevers-
ible or incapacitating reversible illness. These are mostly specifi  c chemical species such as 
fl uorine (P056) or 3-chloropropane nitrile (P027).
U-type miscellaneous hazardous wastes• : These are predominantly specifi  c compounds 
such as calcium chromate (U032) or phthalic anhydride (U190).
Compared to RCRA, CERCLA gives a rather broad defi  nition of hazardous substances that 
includes the following:
Any element, compound, mixture, solution, or substance, the release of which may sub-• 
stantially endanger public health, public welfare, or the environment
Any element, compound, mixture, solution, or substance in reportable quantities desig-• 
nated by CERCLA Section 102
Certain substances or toxic pollutants designated by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.• 
Any hazardous air pollutant listed under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act• 
Any imminently hazardous chemical substance or mixture that has been the subject of • 
government action under Section 7 of the TSCA
With the exception of those suspended by Congress under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, • 
any hazardous waste listed or having characteristics identifi  ed by RCRA § 3001
20.2.2 H AZARDOUS  WASTES
Three basic approaches to defi  ning hazardous wastes are (1) a qualitative description by origin, 
type, and constituents; (2) classifi  cation by characteristics largely based upon testing procedures; 
and (3) by means of concentrations of specifi  c hazardous substances. Wastes may be classifi  ed by 
general type such as “spent halogenated solvents” or by industrial sources such as “pickling liquor 
from steel manufacturing.”
20.2.2.1 Hazardous Wastes and Air and Water Pollution Control
Somewhat paradoxically, measures taken to reduce air and water pollution (Figure 20.1) have had a 
tendency to increase production of hazardous wastes. Most water treatment processes yield sludges Nature, Sources, and Environmental Chemistry of Hazardous Wastes 549
or concentrated liquors that require stabilization and disposal. Air scrubbing processes likewise 
produce sludges. Baghouses and precipitators used to control air pollution all yield signifi  cant quan-
tities of solids, some of which are hazardous.
20.3 SOURCES OF WASTES
Quantities of hazardous wastes produced each year are not known with certainty and depend upon 
the defi  nitions used for such materials. In 1988, the fi  gure for RCRA-regulated wastes in the United 
States was placed at 290 million tons. However, most of this material was water, with only a few 
 million tons consisting of solids. Some high-water-content wastes are generated directly by processes 
that require large quantities of water in waste treatment, and other aqueous wastes are produced by 
mixing hazardous wastes with wastewater.
Some wastes that might exhibit a degree of hazard are exempt from RCRA regulation by legislation. 
These exempt wastes include the following:
Fuel ash and scrubber sludge from power generation by utilities• 
Oil and gas drilling muds• 
By-product brine from petroleum production• 
Cement kiln dust• 
Waste and sludge from phosphate mining and benefi  ciation • 
Mining wastes from uranium and other minerals• 
Household wastes• FIGURE 20.1 Potential contributions of air and water pollution control measures to hazardous wastes

20.3.1 T YPES OF HAZARDOUS  WASTES
In terms of quantity by mass, the greatest quantities are those from categories designated by 
 hazardous waste numbers preceded by F and K, respectively. The former are those from nonspecifi  c 
sources and include the following examples:
F001—the spent halogenated solvents used in degreasing: tetrachloroethylene, trichloro-• 
ethylene, methylene chloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, carbon tetrachloride, and the chlori-
nated fl  uorocarbons; and sludges from the recovery of these solvents in degreasing 
operations
F004—the spent nonhalogenated solvents: cresols, cresylic acid, and nitro-benzene; and • 
still bottoms from the recovery of these solvents
F007—spent plating-bath solutions from electroplating operations• 
F010—quenching-bath sludge from oil baths from metal heat treating operations• 
The “K-type” hazardous wastes are those from specifi  c sources produced by industries such as the 
manufacture of inorganic pigments, organic chemicals, pesticides, explosives, iron and steel, and 
nonferrous metals, and from processes such as petroleum refi  n i n g  o r  w o o d  p r e s e r v a t i o n ;  s o m e  
examples are given below:
K001—bottoms sediment sludge from the treatment of wastewaters from wood-preserving • 
processes that use creosote and/or pentachlorophenol
K002—wastewater treatment sludge from the production of chrome yellow and orange • 
pigments
K020—heavy ends (residue) from the distillation of vinyl chloride in vinyl chloride • 
monomer production
K043—2,6-dichlorophenol waste from the production of 2,4-D• 
K047—pink/red water from TNT operations• 
K049—slop oil emulsion solids from the petroleum refi  ning industry • 
K060—ammonia lime still sludge from coking operations• 
K067—electrolytic anode slimes/sludges from primary zinc production• 
The remainder of wastes consists of reactive wastes, corrosive wastes, toxic wastes, ignitable wastes, 
and “P” wastes (discarded commercial chemical products, off-specifi  cation species, containers, and 
spill residues), “U” wastes, and unspecifi  ed types.
20.3.2 H AZARDOUS  WASTE GENERATORS
Several hundred thousand companies generate hazardous wastes in the United States, but most of 
these generators produce only small quantities. Hazardous waste generators are unevenly distrib-
uted geographically across the continental United States, with a relatively large number located in 
the industrialized upper Midwest, including the states of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, and 
Wisconsin.
Industry types of hazardous waste generators can be divided among the seven following major 
categories, each containing of the order of 10–20% of hazardous waste generators: chemicals and 
allied products manufacture, petroleum-related industries, fabricated metals, metal-related prod-
ucts, electrical equipment manufacture, “all other manufacturing,” and nonmanufacturing and non-
specifi  ed generators. About 10% of the generators produce more than 95% of all hazardous wastes. 
Whereas, as noted above, the number of hazardous waste generators is distributed relatively evenly 
among several major types of industries, 70–85% of the quantities  of hazardous wastes are gener-
ated by the chemical and petroleum industries. Of the remainder, about three-fourth comes from 
metal-related industries and about one-fourth from all other industries.Nature, Sources, and Environmental Chemistry of Hazardous Wastes 551
Household hazardous wastes are potential contaminants of municipal refuse that are supposed to 
be collected separately by municipalities. The problem of household hazardous wastes is compli-
cated by the literally millions of individual household sources and the variability in the diligence 
with which citizens collect and segregate the wastes. A variety of substances occur in household 
hazardous wastes including insecticides, cleaners, oils, batteries, and fl  uorescent light bulbs (which 
contain small amounts of mercury). One of the most common components of these wastes consists 
of leftover paint. Household paint wastes have been the subject of a study in Denmark that found 
that most of the paint waste was composed of water-based paint.2 The content of heavy metals in the 
paint waste was found to be less than that of ordinary household waste and it was concluded that it 
would be safe to discard water-based paint with ordinary household refuse.
20.4 FLAMMABLE AND COMBUSTIBLE SUBSTANCES
Most chemicals that are likely to burn accidentally are liquids. Liquids form vapors , which are 
 usually more dense than air and thus tend to settle. The tendency of a liquid to ignite is measured 
by a test in which the liquid is heated and periodically exposed to a fl  ame until the mixture of vapor 
and air ignites at the liquid’s surface. The temperature at which ignition occurs under these condi-
tions is called the fl  ash point . 
With these defi  nitions in mind, it is possible to divide ignitable materials into four major classes. 
A fl  ammable solid  is one that can ignite from friction or from heat remaining from its manufacture, 
or which may cause a serious hazard if ignited. Explosive materials are not included in this classifi  -
cation. A fl  ammable liquid  is one having a fl  ash point below 60.5 ∞C (141 ∞F). A combustible liquid  
has a fl  ash point in excess of 60.5 ∞C, but below 93.3 ∞C (200 ∞F). Whereas gases are substances that 
exist entirely in the gaseous phase at 0 ∞C and 1 atm pressure, a fl  ammable compressed gas  meets 
specifi  ed criteria for lower fl  ammability limit (LFL), fl  ammability range (see below), and fl  ame 
projection.
In considering the ignition of vapors, two important concepts are those of fl  ammability limit and 
fl ammability range. Values of the vapor/air ratio below which ignition cannot occur because of 
insuffi  cient fuel defi  ne the LFL. Similarly, values of the vapor/air ratio above which ignition cannot 
occur because of insuffi  cient air defi  ne the upper fl  ammability limit  (UFL). The difference between 
upper and LFLs at a specifi  ed temperature is the fl a m m a b i l i t y  r a n g e . Table 20.1 gives some exam-
ples of these values for common liquid chemicals. The percentage of fl  ammable substance for best 
combustion (most explosive mixture) is labeled “optimal.” In the case of acetone, for example, the 
optimal fl  ammable mixture is 5.0% acetone.

One of the more disastrous problems that can occur with fl  ammable liquids is a boiling liquid 
expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE). These are caused by rapid pressure buildup in closed contain-
ers of fl  ammable liquids heated by an external source. The explosion occurs when the pressure 
buildup is suffi  cient to break the container walls.
20.4.1 C OMBUSTION  OF FINELY DIVIDED  PARTICLES
Finely divided particles of combustible materials are somewhat analogous to vapors with respect 
to fl ammability. One such example is a spray or mist of hydrocarbon liquid in which oxygen has the 
opportunity for intimate contact with the liquid particles causing the liquid to ignite at a temperature 
below its fl  ash point.
Dust explosions  can occur with a large variety of solids that have been ground to a fi  nely divided 
state. Many metal dusts, particularly those of magnesium and its alloys, zirconium, titanium, and 
 aluminum, can burn explosively in air. In the case of aluminum, for example, the reaction is the 
following:
 4Al(powder)  + 3O2(from air)  Æ 2Al2O3. (20.1)
Coal dusts and grain dusts have caused many fatal fi  res and explosions in coal mines and grain 
elevators, respectively. Dusts of polymers such as cellulose acetate, polyethylene, and polystyrene 
can also be explosive.
20.4.2 O XIDIZERS
Combustible substances are reducing agents that react with oxidizers  (oxidizing agents or oxidants) 
to produce heat. Diatomic oxygen, O2, from air is the most common oxidizer. Many oxidizers are 
chemical compounds that contain oxygen in their formulas. The halogens (periodic table group 7A) 
and many of their compounds are oxidizers. Some examples of oxidizers are given in Table 20.2.
An example of a reaction of an oxidizer is that of concentrated HNO3 with copper metal, which 
gives toxic NO2 gas as a product:
 4HNO3 + Cu Æ Cu(NO3)2 + 2H2O + 2NO2. (20.2)

20.4.3 S PONTANEOUS  IGNITION
Substances that catch fi  re spontaneously in air without an ignition source are called pyrophoric . 
These include several elements—white phosphorus, the alkali metals (group 1A), and powdered 
forms of magnesium, calcium, cobalt, manganese, iron, zirconium, and aluminum. Also included 
are some organometallic compounds, such as ethyllithium (LiC2H5) and phenyllithium (LiC6H5), 
and some metal carbonyl compounds, such as iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO)5). Another major class 
of pyrophoric compounds consists of metal and metalloid hydrides, including lithium hydride, 
LiH; pentaborane, B5H9; and arsine, AsH3. Moisture in air is often a factor in spontaneous igni-
tion. For example, lithium hydride undergoes the following reaction with water from moist air:
 LiH + H2O Æ LiOH + H2 + heat (20.3)
The heat generated from this reaction can be suffi  cient to ignite the hydride so that it burns in air:
 2LiH + O2 Æ Li2O + H2O (20.4)
Some compounds with organometallic character are also pyrophoric. An example of such a com-
pound is diethylethoxyaluminum:
DiethylethoxyaluminumH5C2
H5C2AlOC2H5
Many mixtures of oxidizers and oxidizable chemicals catch fi  re spontaneously and are called hyper-
golic mixtures . Nitric acid and phenol form such a mixture.
20.4.4 T OXIC PRODUCTS  OF COMBUSTION
Some of the greater dangers of fi  res are from toxic products and by-products of combustion. The 
most obvious of these is carbon monoxide, CO, which can cause serious illness or death because it 
forms carboxyhemoglobin with hemoglobin in the blood so that the blood no longer carries oxygen 
to body tissues. Toxic SO2, P4O10, and HCl are formed by the combustion of sulfur, phosphorus, and 
organochlorine compounds, respectively. A large number of noxious organic compounds such as 
aldehydes are generated as by-products of combustion. In addition to forming carbon monoxide, 
combustion under oxygen-defi  cient conditions produces PAHs consisting of fused ring structures. 
Some of these compounds, such as benzo[ a]pyrene, below, are precarcinogens that are acted upon 
by enzymes in the body to yield cancer-producing metabolites.
Benzo[ a]pyren e
20.5 REACTIVE SUBSTANCES
Reactive substances  are those that tend to undergo rapid or violent reactions under certain condi-
tions. Such substances include those that react violently or form potentially explosive mixtures with 
water. An example is sodium metal, which reacts strongly with water as follows:
 2Na + 2H2O Æ 2NaOH + H2 + heat (20.5)554 Environmental Chemistry
This reaction usually generates enough heat to ignite the sodium and hydrogen. Explosives 
 constitute another class of reactive substances. For regulatory purposes, substances are also 
classifi  ed as reactive that produce toxic gases or vapors when they react with water, acid, or 
base. Hydrogen sulfi  de or hydrogen cyanide is the most common toxic substances released in 
this manner.
Heat and temperature are usually very important factors in reactivity. Many reactions require 
energy of activation to get them started. The rates of most reactions tend to increase sharply with 
increasing temperature and most chemical reaction s give off heat. Therefore, once a reaction is 
started in a reactive mixture lacking an effective means of heat dissipation, the rate may increase 
exponentially with time, leading to an uncontrollable event. Other factors that may affect reaction 
rate include physical form of reactants (e.g., a fi  nely divided metal powder that reacts explosively 
with oxygen, whereas a single mass of metal barely reacts), rate and degree of mixing of reactants, 
degree of dilution with nonreactive media (solvent), presence of a catalyst, and pressure.
Some chemical compounds are self-reactive in that they contain oxidant and reductant in the 
same compound. Nitroglycerin, a strong explosive with the formula C3H5(ONO2)3, decomposes 
spontaneously to CO2, H2O, O2, and N2 with a rapid release of a very high amount of energy. Pure 
nitroglycerin has such a high inherent instability that only a slight blow may be suffi  cient to detonate 
it. TNT is also an explosiv e with a high degree of reactivity . Ho w ev er , it is inherently relativ ely 
stable in that some sort of detonating device is required to cause it to explode.
20.5.1 C HEMICAL  STRUCTURE  AND REACTIVITY
As shown in Table 20.3, some chemical structures are associated with high reactivity. High reactiv-
ity in some organic compounds results from unsaturated bonds in the carbon skeleton, particularly 
where multiple bonds are adjacent (allenes, C =C=C) or separated by only one carbon–carbon 
single bond (dienes, C =C-C=C). Some organic structures involving oxygen are very reactive. 
Examples are oxiranes, such as ethylene oxide, 
O
CC HH
HH Ethylene oxide
hydroperoxides (ROOH), and peroxides (ROOR ¢), where R and R ¢ stand for hydrocarbon moieties 
such as the methyl group, -CH3. Many organic compounds containing nitrogen along with carbon 
and hydrogen are very reactive. Included are triazenes containing a functionality with three nitrogen 
atoms (R -N=N-N), some azo compounds (R -N=N-R¢), and some nitriles in which a nitrogen 
atom is triply bonded to a carbon atom:
R-C∫N Nitrile
Functional groups containing both oxygen and nitrogen tend to impart reactivity to an organic 
compound. Examples of such functional groups are alkyl nitrates (R -ONO2), alkyl nitrites 
 (R-O-N=O), nitroso compounds (R -N=O), and nitro compounds (R -NO2).
Many different classes of inorganic compounds are reactive. These include some of the halogen 
compounds of nitrogen (shock-sensitive nitrogen triiodide, NI3, is an outstanding example), compounds 
with metal–nitrogen bonds (NaN3), halogen oxides (ClO2), and compounds with oxyanions of the 
 halogens. An example of the last group of compounds is ammonium perchlorate, NH4ClO4, which was 
involved in a series of massive explosions that destroyed 8 million lb of the compound, injured 300 
workers, caused $75 million in damage, and demolished a 40 million lb per year U.S. rocket fuel plant 
near Henderson, Nevada, in 1988. (By late 1989, a new $92 million plant for the manufacture of 
ammonium perchlorate had been constructed near Cedar City in a remote region of southwest Utah. 
Prudently, the buildings at the new plant were placed at large distances from each other!)Nature, Sources, and Environmental Chemistry of Hazardous Wastes 555
Explosives such as nitroglycerin or TNT are single compounds containing both oxidizing and 
reducing functions in the same molecule. Such substances are commonly called redox compounds . 
Some redox compounds have even more oxygen than is needed for a complete reaction and are said 
to have a positive balance of oxygen, some have exactly the stoichiometric quantity of oxygen 
required (zero balance, maximum energy release), and others have a negative balance and require 
oxygen from outside sources to completely oxidize all components. TNT has a substantial negative 
balance of oxygen; ammonium dichromate [(NH4)2Cr2O7] has a zero balance, reacting with exact 
stoichiometry to H2O, N2, and Cr2O3; and treacherously explosive nitroglycerin has a positive bal-
ance as shown by the following reaction:
 4C3H5N3O9 Æ 12CO2 + 10H2O + 6N2 + O2. (20.6) 
20.6 CORROSIVE SUBSTANCES
Corrosive substances  are regarded as those that dissolve metals or cause oxidized material to form 
on the surface of metals—rusted iron is a prime example—and, more broadly, cause deterioration 
of materials, including living tissue, that they contact. Most corrosives belong to at least one of the 
four following chemical classes: (1) strong acids, (2) strong bases, (3) oxidants, and (4) dehydrating 
agents. Table 20.4 lists some of the major corrosive substances and their effects.TABLE 20.3

20.6.1 S ULFURIC  ACID
Sulfuric acid is a prime example of a corrosive substance. As well as being a strong acid,  concentrated 
sulfuric acid is also a dehydrating agent and oxidant. The tremendous affi  nity of H2SO4 for water is 
illustrated by the heat generated when water and concentrated sulfuric acid are mixed. If this is 
done incorrectly by adding water to the acid, localized boiling and spattering can occur that result 
in personal injury. The major destructive effect of sulfuric acid on skin tissue is removal of water 
with accompanying release of heat. Sulfuric acid decomposes carbohydrates by removal of water. 
In contact with sugar, for example, concentrated sulfuric acid reacts to leave a charred mass. The 
reaction is
 C12H22O11    H2SO4    11H2O (H2SO4) + 12C + heat. (20.7)
Some dehydration reactions of sulfuric acid can be very vigorous. For example, the reaction with 
perchloric acid produces unstable Cl2O7, and a violent explosion can result. Concentrated sulfuric 
acid produces dangerous or toxic products with a number of other substances, such as toxic carbon 
monoxide (CO) from reaction with oxalic acid, H2C2O4; toxic bromine and sulfur dioxide (Br2, SO2) 
from reaction with sodium bromide, NaBr; and toxic, unstable chlorine dioxide (ClO2) from reac-
tion with sodium chlorate, NaClO3.
Contact with sulfuric acid causes severe tissue destruction resulting in a severe burn that may be 
diffi cult to heal. Inhalation of sulfuric acid fumes or mists damages tissues in the upper  respiratory 
tract and eyes. Long-term exposure to sulfuric acid fumes or mists has caused erosion of teeth!
20.7 TOXIC SUBSTANCES
Toxicity is of the utmost concern in dealing with hazardous substances. This includes both long-
term chronic effects from continual or periodic exposures to low levels of toxicants and acute effects 
from a single large exposure. Toxic substances are covered in greater detail in Chapters 23 and 24.
20.7.1 T OXICITY  CHARACTERISTIC  LEACHING  PROCEDURE  
For regulatory and remediation purposes, a standard test is needed to measure the likelihood of 
toxic substances getting into the environment and causing harm to organisms. The U.S. EPA TABLE 20.4

 specifi  es a test called the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure  (TCLP)  designed to 
 determine the toxicity hazard of wastes.3 The test was designed to estimate the availability to organ-
isms of both inorganic and organic species in hazardous materials present as liquids, solids, or 
multiple phase mixtures and does not test for the direct toxic effects of wastes. Basically, the proce-
dure consists of leaching a material with a solvent designed to mimic leachate generated in a munic-
ipal waste disposal site, followed by chemical analysis of the leachate.
20.8 PHYSICAL FORMS AND SEGREGATION OF WASTES
Three major categories of wastes based upon their physical forms are organic materials , aqueous 
wastes , and sludges . These forms largely determine the course of action taken in treating and dispos-
ing of the wastes. The level of segregation , a concept illustrated in Figure 20.2, is very important in 
treating, storing, and disposing of different kinds of wastes. It is relatively easy to deal with wastes 
that are not mixed with other kinds of wastes, that is, those that are highly segregated. For example, 
spent hydrocarbon solvents can be used as fuel in boilers. However, if these solvents are mixed with 
spent organochlorine solvents, the production of contaminant hydrogen chloride during combustion 
may prevent fuel use and require disposal in special hazardous waste incinerators. Further mixing 
with inorganic sludges adds mineral matter and water. These impurities complicate the treatment 
processes required by producing mineral ash in incineration or lowering the heating value of the 
material incinerated because of the presence of water. Among the most diffi  cult types of wastes to 
handle and treat are those with the least segregation, of which a “worst-case scenario” would be 
“dilute sludge consisting of mixed organic and inorganic wastes,” as shown in Figure 20.2.
An important factor related to segregation and mixing of wastes is the possibility of waste incom-
patibility . It is crucial that wastes not be mixed that will react together adversely or where one waste 
ma y e xacerbate problems with another . For e xample, mixing acid with metal sulfi  de wastes can 
result in release of toxic H2S gas. Chelating agents such as EDTA mixed with heavy-metal salts can 
cause the heavy metals to become mobile as anionic chelates.

Concentration  of wastes is an important factor in their management. A waste that has been 
 concentrated or, preferably, never diluted is generally much easier and more economical to handle 
than one that is dispersed in a large quantity of water or soil. Dealing with hazardous wastes is 
greatly facilitated when the original quantities of wastes are minimized and the wastes remain 
 separated and concentrated insofar as possible.
20.9 ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY OF HAZARDOUS WASTES
The properties of hazardous materials, their production, and what makes a hazardous substance a 
hazardous waste were discussed in preceding parts of this chapter. Hazardous materials normally 
cause problems when they enter the environment and have detrimental effects on organisms or other 
parts of the environment. Therefore, the present chapter deals with the environmental chemistry of 
hazardous materials. In discussing the environmental chemistry of hazardous materials, it is conve-
nient to consider the following fi  ve aspects based upon the defi  nition of environmental chemistry:
Origins• 
Transport• 
Reactions• 
Effects• 
Fates• 
It is also useful to consider the fi  ve environmental spheres as defi  ned and outlined in Chapter 1:
Anthrosphere• 
Geosphere• 
Hydrosphere• 
Atmosphere• 
Biosphere• 
Hazardous materials almost always originate in the anthrosphere, are often discarded into the 
geosphere, and are frequently transported through the hydrosphere or the atmosphere. The greatest 
concern for their effects is usually on the biosphere, particularly human beings. Figure 20.3 sum-
marizes these relationships. 
There are a variety of ways in which hazardous wastes get into the environment. Although now 
much more controlled by pollution prevention laws, hazardous substances have been deliberately 
added to the environment by humans. Wastewater containing a variety of toxic substances has

been discharged in large quantities into waterways. Hazardous gases and particulate matter have 
been discharged into the atmosphere through stacks from power plants, incinerators, and a vari-
ety of industrial operations. Hazardous wastes have been deliberately spread on soil or placed in 
landfi  lls in the geosphere. Evaporation and wind erosion may move hazardous materials from 
wastes dumps into the atmosphere, or they may be leached from waste dumps into groundwater 
or surface waters. Underground storage tanks or pipelines have leaked a variety of materials into 
soil. Accidents, fi  res, and explosions may distribute dangerous materials into the environment. 
Another source of such materials consists of improperly operated waste treatment or storage 
facilities.
20.10 PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF HAZARDOUS WASTES
Having considered the generation of hazardous wastes from the anthrosphere, the next thing to 
consider is their properties, which determine movement and other kinds of behaviors. These proper-
ties can be generally divided into physical and chemical properties.
The behavior of waste substances in the atmosphere is largely determined by their volatilities. In 
addition, their solubilities in water determine the degree to which they are likely to be removed 
with precipitation. Water solubility is the most important physical property in the hydrosphere. 
The movement of substances through the action of water in the geosphere is largely determined by 
the degree of sorption to soil, mineral strata, and sediments.
Volatility is a function of the vapor pressure of a compound. Vapor pressures at a particular tem-
perature can vary over many orders of magnitude. Of common organic liquids, diethyl ether has one 
of the highest vapor pressures, whereas those of PCBs are very low. When a volatile liquid is present 
in soil or in water, its water solubility also determines how well it evaporates. For example, although 
methanol boils at a lower temperature than benzene, the much lower solubility of benzene in water 
means that it has the greater tendency to go from the hydrosphere or geosphere into the atmosphere.
The environmental movement, effects, and fates of hazardous waste compounds are strongly 
related to their chemical properties. For example, a toxic heavy-metal cationic species, such as Pb2+ 
ion, may be strongly held by negatively charged soil solids. If the lead is chelated by the chelating 
EDTA anion, represented Y 4-, it becomes much more mobile as PbY2-, an anionic form. Chelation 
of cobalt(II) and cobalt(III) with NTA anion (Section 3.14) makes the metal much more mobile in 
mineral strata. Oxidation state can be very important in the movement of hazardous substances. The 
reduced states of iron and manganese, Fe 2+ and Mn 2+, respectively, are water soluble and relatively 
mobile in the hydrosphere and geosphere. However, in their common oxidized states, Fe(III) and 
Mn(IV), these  elements are present as insoluble Fe2O3 . xH2O and MnO2, which have virtually no 
tendency to move. Furthermore, these iron and manganese oxides will sequester heavy-metal ions, 
such as Pb 2+ and Cd 2+, preventing their movement in the soluble form.
The major properties of hazardous substances and their surroundings that determine the envi-
ronmental transport of such substances are the following:
Physical properties of the substances, including vapor pressure and solubility• 
Physical properties of the surrounding matrix• 
Physical conditions to which wastes are subjected. Higher temperatures and erosive wind • 
conditions enable volatile substances to move more readily
Chemical and biochemical properties of wastes. Substances that are less chemically reac-•

The transport of hazardous wastes is largely a function of their physical properties, the physical 
properties of their surrounding matrix, the physical conditions to which they are subjected, and 560 Environmental Chemistry

the atmosphere and more soluble ones to be carried by water. W astes will move farther faster in 
porous, sandy formations than in denser soils. V olatile wastes are more mobile under hot, windy 
conditions, and soluble ones during periods of heavy rainfall. Wastes that are more chemically and 
biochemically reactive will not move so far as less reactive wastes before breaking down.
20.11.1 P HYSICAL  PROPERTIES  OF WASTES
The major physical properties of wastes that determine their amenability to transport are volatility, 
solubility, and the degree to which they are sorbed to solids, including soil and sediments.
The distribution of hazardous waste compounds between the atmosphere and the geosphere or 
hydrosphere is largely a function of compound volatility. Usually, in the hydrosphere, and often in 
soil, hazardous waste compounds are dissolved in water; therefore, the tendency of water to hold 
the compound is a factor in its mobility. For example, although ethyl alcohol has a higher vapor 
 pressure and lower boiling temperature (77.8 ∞C) than toluene (110.6 ∞C), vapor of the latter compound 
is more readily evolved from soil because of its limited solubility in water compared to ethanol, 
which is totally miscible with water.
20.11.2 C HEMICAL  FACTORS
As an illustration of chemical factors involved in transport of wastes, consider cationic inorganic 
species consisting of common metal ions. These inorganic species can be divided into three groups 
based upon their retention by clay minerals. Elements that tend to be highly retained by clay include 
cadmium, mercury, lead, and zinc. Potassium, magnesium, iron, silicon, and NH4+ ions are moder-
ately retained by clay, whereas sodium, chloride, calcium, manganese, and boron ions are poorly 
retained. The retention of the last three elements is probably biased in that they are leached from 
clay, so that negative retention (elution) is often observed. It should be noted, however, that the reten-
tion of iron and manganese is a strong function of oxidation state in that the reduced forms of Mn 
and Fe are relatively poorly retained, whereas the oxidized forms of Fe2O3 . xH2O and MnO2 are 
very insoluble and stay on soil as solids.
20.11.3 E FFECTS  OF HAZARDOUS  WASTES
The effects of hazardous wastes in the environment may be divided among effects on organisms, 
effects on materials, and effects on the environment. These are addressed briefl  y here and in greater 
detail in later sections.
The ultimate concern with wastes has to do with their toxic effects on animals, plants, and 
microbes. Virtually all hazardous waste substances are poisonous to a degree, some extremely so. 
The toxicity of a waste is a function of many factors, including the chemical nature of the waste, the 
matrix in which it is contained, circumstances of exposure, the species exposed, manner of expo-
sure, degree of exposure, and time of exposure. The toxicities of hazardous wastes are discussed in 
more detail in Chapters 23 and 24.
As defi  ned in Section 20.6, many hazardous wastes are corrosive  to materials, usually because 
of extremes of pH or because of dissolved salt content. Oxidant wastes can cause combustible sub-
stances to burn uncontrollably. Highly reactive wastes can explode, causing damage to materials 
and structures. Contamination by wastes, such as by toxic pesticides in grain, can result in sub-
stances becoming unfi  t for use.
In addition to their toxic effects in the biosphere, hazardous wastes can damage air, water, and soil. 
Wastes that get into air can cause deterioration of air quality, either directly or by the formation of 
secondary pollutants. Hazardous waste compounds dissolved in, suspended in, or fl  oating as surface 
fi lms on the surface of water can render it unfi  t for use and for sustenance of aquatic organisms.Nature, Sources, and Environmental Chemistry of Hazardous Wastes 561
Soil exposed to hazardous wastes can be severely damaged by alteration of its physical and 
chemical properties and ability to support plants. For example, soil exposed to concentrated brines 
from petroleum production may become unable to support plant growth so that the soil becomes 
extremely susceptible to erosion.
20.11.4 F ATES OF HAZARDOUS  WASTES
The fates of hazardous waste substances are addressed in more detail in subsequent sections. As 
with all environmental pollutants, such substances eventually reach a state of physical and chemical 
stability , although that may take many centuries to occur. In some cases, the fate of a hazardous 
waste material is a simple function of its physical properties and surroundings. 
The fate of a hazardous waste substance in water is a function of the substance’s solubility, 
 density, biodegradability, and chemical reactivity. Dense, water-immiscible liquids may simply sink 
to the bottoms of bodies of water or aquifers and accumulate there as “blobs” of liquid. Biodegradable 
substances are broken down by bacteria, a process for which the availability of oxygen is an impor-
tant variable. Substances that readily undergo bioaccumulation are taken up by organisms, exchange-
able cationic materials become bound to sediments, and organophilic materials may be sorbed by 
organic matter in sediments.
The fates of hazardous waste substances in the atmosphere are often determined by photochemi-
cal reactions. Ultimately, such substances may be converted to nonvolatile, insoluble matter and 
precipitate from the atmosphere onto soil or plants.
20.12 HAZARDOUS WASTES AND THE ANTHROSPHERE
As the part of the environment where humans process substances, the anthrosphere is the source 
of most hazardous wastes. These materials may come from manufacturing, transportation activi-
ties, agriculture, and any one of a number of activities in the anthrosphere. Hazardous wastes may 
be in any physical form and may include liquids, such as spent halogenated solvents used in 
degreasing parts; semisolid sludges, such as those generated from the gravitation separation of oil/
water/solids mixtures in petroleum refi  ning; and solids, such as baghouse dusts from the produc-
tion of pesticides.
Releases of hazardous wastes from the anthrosphere commonly occur through incidents such 
as spills of liquids, accidental discharge of gases or vapors, fi  res, and explosions. RCRA regula-
tions designed to minimize such accidental releases from the anthrosphere and to deal with them 
when they occur are contained in 40 CFR 265.31 (Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 
Part 265.31). Under these regulations, hazardous waste generators are required to have specifi  ed 
equipment, trained personnel, and procedures that protect human health in the event of a release, 
and that facilitate remediation if a release occurs. An effective means of communication for sum-
moning help and giving emergency instruction must be available. Also required are fi  refi ghting 
capabilities including fi  re extinguishers and adequate water. To deal with spills, a facility is 
required to have on hand absorbents, such as granular vermiculite clay, or absorbents in the form 
of pillows or pads. Neutralizing agents for corrosive substances that may be used should be 
 available as well.
As noted above, hazardous wastes originate in the anthrosphere. However, to a large extent, they 
move, have effects, and end up in the anthrosphere as well. Large quantities of hazardous substances 
are moved by truck, rail, ship, and pipeline. Spills and releases from such movement, ranging from 
minor leaks from small containers to catastrophic releases of petroleum from wrecked tanker ships, 
are a common occurrence. Much effort in the area of environmental protection can be profi  tably 
devoted to minimizing and increasing the safety of the transport of hazardous substances through 
the anthrosphere.562 Environmental Chemistry
In the United States, the transportation of hazardous substances is regulated through the U.S. 
Department of Transportation (DOT). One of the ways in which this is done is through the manifest  
system of documentation designed to accomplish the following goals:
Acts as a tracking device to establish responsibility for the generation, movement, treat-• 
ment, and disposal of the waste.
By requiring the manifest to accompany the waste, such as during truck transport, it • 
provides information regarding appropriate actions to take during emergencies such as 
collisions, spills, fi  res, or explosions.
Acts as the basic documentation for recordkeeping and reporting.• 
Many of the adverse effects of hazardous substances occur in the anthrosphere. One of the main 
examples of such effects occurs as corrosion of materials that are strongly acidic or basic or that 
otherwise attack materials. Fire and explosion of hazardous materials can cause severe damage to 
anthrospheric infrastructure.
The fate of hazardous materials is often in the anthrosphere. One of the main examples of a 
material dispersed in the anthrosphere consists of lead-based anticorrosive paints that have been 
spread on steel structural members.
20.13 HAZARDOUS WASTES IN THE GEOSPHERE
The sources, transports, interactions, and fates of contaminant hazardous wastes in the geosphere 
involve a complex scheme, some aspects of which are illustrated in Figure 20.4. As illustrated in the 
fi gure, there are numerous vectors by which hazardous wastes can get into groundwater. Leachate 
from a landfi  ll can move as a waste plume carried along by groundwater, in severe cases, draining 
into a stream or into an aquifer where it may contaminate well water. Sewers and pipelines may leak 
hazardous substances into the geosphere. Such substances seep from waste lagoons into geological 
strata, eventually contaminating groundwater. Wastes leaching from sites where they have been 
spread on land for disposal or as a means of treatment can contaminate the geosphere and ground-
water. In some cases, wastes are pumped into deep wells as a means of disposal.
The movement of hazardous waste constituents in the geosphere is largely by the action of fl  ow-
ing water in a waste plume as shown in Figure 20.4. The speed and degree of waste fl  ow depend 
upon numerous factors. Hydrologic factors such as water gradient and permeability of the solid 
formations through which the waste plume moves are important. The rate of fl  ow is usually rather 
slow, typically several centimeters per day. An important aspect of the movement of wastes through 
the geosphere is attenuation  by the mineral strata. This occurs because waste compounds are sorbed

to solids by various mechanisms. A measure of the attenuation can be expressed by a distribution 
coeffi  cient , Kd, 
 Kd =   Cs ___ Cw   (20.8)
where Cs and Cw are the equilibrium concentrations of the constituent on solids and in solution, 
respectively. This relationship assumes relatively ideal behavior of the hazardous substance that is 
partitioned between water and solids (the sorbate). A more empirical expression is based on the 
Freundlich equation:
 Cs = KFCeq1/n (20.9)
where KF and 1/ n are empirical constants.
Several important properties of the solid determine the degree of sorption. One obvious factor is 
surface area. The chemical nature of the surface is also important. Among the important chemical 
factors are presence of sorptive clays, hydrous metal oxides, and humus (particularly important for 
the sorption of organic substances).
In general, sorption of hazardous waste solutes is higher above the water table in the unsaturated 
zone of soil. This region tends to have a higher surface area and favor aerobic biodegradation 
processes. 
The chemical nature of the leachate is important in sorptive processes of hazardous substances 
in the geosphere. Organic solvents or detergents in leachates will solubilize organic materials, pre-
venting their retention by solids. Acidic leachates tend to dissolve metal oxides:
 M(OH)2(s) + 2H+ Æ M2+ + 2H2O (20.10)
thus preventing sorption of metals in insoluble forms. This is a reason that leachates from municipal 
landfi  lls, which contain weak organic acids, are particularly prone to transport metals. Solubilization 
by acids is particularly important in the movement of heavy-metal ions.
Heavy metals are among the most dangerous hazardous waste constituents that are transported 
through the geosphere. Many factors affect their movement and attenuation. The temperature, pH, 
and reducing nature (as expressed by the negative log of the electron activity, p E) of the solvent 
medium are important. The nature of the solids, especially the inorganic and organic chemical 
functional groups on the surface, the CEC, and the surface area of the solids largely determine the 
attenuation of heavy-metal ions. In addition to being sorbed and undergoing ion exchange with 
geospheric solids, heavy metals may undergo oxidation–reduction processes, precipitate as slightly 
soluble solids (especially sulfi  des), and in some cases, such as occurs with mercury, undergo micro-
bial methylation reactions that produce mobile organometallic species.
The importance of chelating agents interacting with metals and increasing their mobilities has 
been illustrated by the effects of chelating EDTA on the mobility of radioactive heavy metals, 
 especially 60Co. The EDTA and other chelating agents, such as diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid 
(DTP A ) and nitrilotriacetic acid (NT A ) , w ere used to dissol v e metals in the decontamination of 
radioactive facilities and were codisposed with radioactive materials at Oak Ridge National 
Laboratory (Tennessee) during the period 1951–1965. Unexpectedly high rates of radioactive metal 
mobility were observed, which was attributed to the formation of anionic species such as 60CoT- 
(where T3- is the chelating NTA anion). Whereas unchelated cationic metal species are strongly 
retained in soil by precipitation reactions and cation exchange processes
 Co2+ + 2OH- Æ Co(OH)2(s) (9.10)
 2Soil}-H+ + Co2+ Æ (Soil}-)2Co2+ + 2H+ (9.11)564 Environmental Chemistry
anion bonding processes are very weak, so that the chelated anionic metal species are not strongly 
bound. Naturally occurring humic acid chelating agents may also be involved in the subsurface move-
ment of radioactive metals. It is now generally accepted that poorly biodegradable, strong chelating 
agents, of which EDTA is the prime example, will facilitate transport of metal radionuclides, whereas 
oxalate and citrate will not do so because they form relatively weak complexes and are readily bio-
degraded. Biodegradation of chelating agents tends to be a slow process under subsurface conditions.
Soil can be severely damaged by hazardous waste substances. Such materials may alter the phys-
ical and chemical properties of soil and thus its ability to support plants. Some of the more cata-
strophic incidents in which soil has been damaged by exposure to hazardous materials have arisen 
from soil contamination from SO2 emitted from copper or lead smelters, or from brines from petro-
leum production. Both of these contaminants stop the growth of plants and, without the binding 
effects of viable plant root systems, topsoil is rapidly lost by erosion.
20.14 HAZARDOUS WASTES IN THE HYDROSPHERE
Hazardous waste substances may enter the hydrosphere as leachate from waste landfi  lls, drainage 
from waste ponds, seepage from sewer lines, or runoff from soil. Deliberate release into waterways 
also occurs, and is a particular problem in countries with lax environmental enforcement. There are, 
therefore, numerous ways by which hazardous materials may enter the hydrosphere.
For the most part, the hydrosphere is a dynamic, moving system, so that it provides perhaps the 
most important variety of pathways for moving hazardous waste species in the environment. Once in 
the hydrosphere, hazardous waste species can undergo a number of processes by which they are 
degraded, retained, and transformed. These include the common chemical processes of precipitation–
dissolution, acid–base reactions, hydrolysis, and oxidation–reduction reactions. Also included are a 
wide variety of biochemical processes which, in most cases, reduce hazards, but in some cases, such 
as the biomethylation of mercury, greatly increase the risks posed by hazardous wastes.
The unique properties of water have a strong infl  uence on the environmental chemistry of haz-
ardous wastes in the hydrosphere. Aquatic systems are subject to constant change. Water moves 
with groundwater fl  ow, stream fl  ow, and convection currents. Bodies of water become stratifi  ed so 
that low-oxygen reducing conditions may prevail in the bottom regions of a body of water and there 
is a constant interaction of the hydrosphere with the other environmental spheres. There is a con-
tinuing exchange of materials between water and the other environmental spheres. Organisms in 
water may have a strong infl  uence on even poorly biodegradable hazardous waste species through 
bioaccumulation mechanisms.
Figure 20.5 shows some of the pertinent aspects of hazardous waste materials in bodies of water, 
with emphasis upon the strong role played by sediments. An interesting kind of hazardous waste

material that may accumulate in sediments consists of dense, water -immiscible liquids that may 
sink to the bottom of bodies of water or aquifers and remain there as “blobs” of liquid. Hundreds of 
tons of PCB wastes have accumulated in sediments in the Hudson River in New York State and are 
the subject of a heated debate regarding how to remediate the problem.
Hazardous waste species undergo a number of physical, chemical, and biochemical processes in the 
hydrosphere, which strongly infl  uence their effects and fates. The major ones of these are listed below:
Hydrolysis reactions•  are those in which a molecule is cleaved with addition of a molecule 
of H2O. An example of a hydrolysis reaction is the hydrolysis of dibutyl phthalate, Hazardous 
Waste Number U069:

Precipitation reactions• , such as the formation of insoluble lead sulfi  de from soluble lead(II) 
ion in the anaerobic regions of a body of water:
 Pb2+ + HS- Æ PbS( s) + H+
An important part of the precipitation process is normally aggregation  of the colloidal particles fi  rst 
formed to produce a cohesive mass. Precipitates are often relatively complicated species, such as the 
basic salt of lead carbonate, 2PbCO3 . Pb(OH)2. Heavy metals, a common ingredient of hazardous 
waste species precipitated in the hydrosphere, tend to form hydroxides, carbonates, and sulfates 
with the OH-, HCO3-, and SO42- ions that commonly are present in water, and sulfi  des are likely to 
be formed in bottom regions of bodies of water where sulfi  de is generated by anaerobic bacteria. 
Heavy metals are often coprecipitated as a minor constituent of some other compound, or are sorbed 
by the surface of another solid.
Oxidation–reduction reactions•  commonly occur with hazardous waste materials in the 
hydrosphere, generally mediated by microorganisms. An example of such a process is the 
oxidation of ammonia to toxic nitrite ion mediated by Nitrosomonas bacteria:
 NH3 + 3
2 O2 Æ H+ + NO-
2(s) + H2O 
Biochemical processes• , which often involve hydrolysis and oxidation–reduction reactions. 
Organic acids and chelating agents, such as citrate, produced by bacterial action may solu-
bilize heavy-metal ions. Bacteria also produce methylated forms of metals, particularly 
mercury and arsenic.
Photolysis reactions•  and miscellaneous chemical phenomena. Photolysis of hazardous 
waste compounds in the hydrosphere commonly occurs on surface fi  lms exposed to sun-
light on the top of water.
Hazardous waste compounds have a number of effects on the hydrosphere. Perhaps the most seri-
ous of these is the contamination of groundwater, which, in some cases, can be almost irreversible. 
Waste compounds accumulate in sediments, such as river or estuary sediments.4 Hazardous waste 
compounds dissolved in, suspended in, or fl  oating as surface fi  lms on the surface of water can 
 render it unfi  t for use and for sustenance of aquatic organisms.
Many factors determine the fate of a hazardous waste substance in water. Among these are the 
substance’s solubility, density, biodegradability, and chemical reactivity. As discussed above and 566 Environmental Chemistry
in Section 20.16, biodegradation largely determines the fates of hazardous waste substances in the 
hydrosphere. In addition to biodegradation, some  substances are concentrated in organisms by 
bioaccumulation processes and may become deposited in sediments as a result. Organophilic 
materials may be sorbed by organic matter in sediments. Cation-exchanging sediments have the 
ability to bind cationic species, including cationic metal ions and organics that form cations.
20.15 HAZARDOUS WASTES IN THE ATMOSPHERE
Hazardous waste chemicals can enter the atmosphere by evaporation from hazardous waste sites, by 
wind erosion, or by direct release. Hazardous waste chemicals usually are not evolved in large enough 
quantities to produce secondary air pollutants, such as photochemical smog, formed by reactions of 
air pollutants in the atmosphere. Therefore, species from hazardous waste sources are usually of most 
concern in the atmosphere as primary pollutants emitted in localized areas at a hazardous waste site. 
Plausible examples of primary air pollutant hazardous waste chemicals include corrosive acid gases, 
particularly HCl; toxic organic vapors, such as vinyl chloride (U043); and toxic inorganic gases, such 
as HCN potentially released by the accidental mixing of waste cyanides with strong acids:
 H2SO4 + 2NaCN Æ Na2SO4 + 2HCN( g) (20.11)
Primary air pollutants such as these are almost always of concern only adjacent to the site or to 
workers involved in site remediation. One such substance that has been responsible for fatal poison-
ings at hazardous waste sites, usually tanks that are undergoing cleanup or demolition, is highly 
toxic hydrogen sulfi  de gas, H2S.
An important characteristic of a hazardous waste material that enters the atmosphere is its pol-
lution potential . This refers to the degree of environmental threat posed by the substance acting as 
a primary pollutant or to its potential to cause harm from secondary pollutants.
Another characteristic of a hazardous waste material that determines its threat to the atmosphere 
is its residence time , which can be expressed by an estimated atmospheric half-life, t1/2. Among the 
factors that go into estimating atmospheric half-lives are water solubilities, rainfall levels, and 
 atmospheric mixing rates.
Hazardous waste compounds in the atmosphere that have signifi  cant water solubilities are com-
monly removed from the atmosphere by dissolution  in water. The water may be in the form of very 
small cloud or fog particles or it may be present as rain droplets.
Some hazardous waste species in the atmosphere are removed by adsorption onto aerosol 
 particles . Typically, the adsorption process is rapid so that the lifetime of the species is that of the 
aerosol particles (typically a few days). Adsorption onto solid particles is the most common removal 
mechanism for highly nonvolatile constituents such as benzo[ a]pyrene.
Dry deposition  is the name given to the process by which hazardous waste species are removed 
from the atmosphere by impingement onto soil, water, or plants on the earth’s surface. These rates 
are dependent upon the type of substance, the nature of the surface that they contact, and weather 
conditions.
A signifi  cant number of hazardous waste substances leave the atmosphere much more rapidly than 
predicted by dissolution, adsorption onto particles, and dry deposition, meaning that chemical pro-
cesses must be involved. The most important of these are photochemical reactions, commonly involv-
ing hydroxyl radical, HO∑. Other reactive atmospheric species that may act to remove hazardous 
waste compounds are ozone (O3), atomic oxygen (O), peroxyl radicals (HOO∑), alkylperoxyl radicals 
(ROO∑), and NO3. Although its concentration in the troposphere is relatively low, HO∑ is so reactive 
that it tends to predominate in the chemical processes that remove hazardous waste species from air. 
Hydroxyl radical undergoes abstraction reactions that remove H atoms from organic compounds:
 R -H + HO∑ Æ R∑ + H2O (20.12)Nature, Sources, and Environmental Chemistry of Hazardous Wastes 567
and may react with those containing unsaturated bonds by addition as illustrated by the following 
reaction:
 ..R
HH
HR H
HH+ CC CC HO OH
. (20.13)
The free radical products are very reactive. They react further to form oxygenated species, such as 
aldehydes, ketones, and dehalogenated organics, eventually leading to the formation of particles or 
water-soluble materials that are readily scavenged from the atmosphere.
Direct photodissociation of hazardous waste compounds in the atmosphere may occur by the 
action of the shorter wavelength light that reaches to the troposphere and is absorbed by a molecule 
with a light-absorbing group called a chromophore :
 R -X + hn Æ R∑ + X∑ (20.14)
Among the factors involved in assessing the effectiveness of direct absorption of light to remove 
species from the atmosphere are light intensity, quantum yields (chemical reactions per quantum 
absorbed), and atmospheric mixing. The requirement of a suitable chromophore limits direct photo-
lysis as a removal mechanism for most compounds other than conjugated alkenes, carbonyl com-
pounds, some halides, and some nitrogen compounds, particularly nitro compounds, all of which 
commonly occur in hazardous wastes.
20.16 HAZARDOUS WASTES IN THE BIOSPHERE
Microorganisms, bacteria, fungi, and, to a certain extent, protozoa may act metabolically on hazardous 
wastes substances in the environment. Therefore, the ecotoxicology of hazardous wastes, that is, their 
toxic effects as they infl  uence organisms in ecosystems, is very important. Most of these substances are 
anthropogenic (made by human activities), and most are classifi  ed as xenobiotic  molecules that are 
foreign to living systems. Although by their nature xenobiotic compounds are degradation resistant, 
almost all classes of them—nonhalogenated alkanes, halogenated alkanes (trichloroethane, dichlo-
romethane), nonhalogenated aryl compounds (benzene, naphthalene, and benzo[ a]pyrene), halogenated 
aryl compounds (HCB, pentachlorophenol), phenols (phenol, cresols), PCBs, phthalate esters, and 
 pesticides (chlordane, parathion)—can be at least partially degraded by various microorganisms. 
Bioaccumulation  occurs in which wastes are concentrated in the tissue of organisms. It is an 
important mechanism by which wastes enter food chains. Biodegradation  occurs when wastes are 
converted by biological processes to generally simpler molecules; the complete conversion to simple 
inorganic species, such as CO2, NH3, SO42-, and H2PO4-/HPO42-, is called mineralization . The pro-
duction of a less toxic product by biochemical processes is called detoxifi  cation . An example is the 
bioconversion of highly toxic organophosphate paraoxon insecticide to p-nitrophenol, which is only 
about l/200 as toxic:

20.16.1 M ICROBIAL  METABOLISM  IN WASTE DEGRADATION
Two major divisions of biochemical metabolism that operate on hazardous waste species are oxic 
(aerobic ) processes  that use molecular O2 as an oxygen source and anoxic  (anaerobic ) processes , 568 Environmental Chemistry
which make use of another oxidant such as sulfate, SO42-, which is reduced to H2S. (This has the 
benefi  t of precipitating insoluble metal sulfi  des in the presence of hazardous waste heavy metals.) 
Because molecular oxygen does not penetrate to such depths, anaerobic processes predominate in 
the deep sediments as shown in Figure 20.5.
For the most part, anthropogenic compounds resist biodegradation much more strongly than do 
naturally occurring compounds. Given the nature of xenobiotic substances, there are very few 
enzyme systems in microorganisms that act specifi  cally on these substances, especially in making 
an initial attack on the molecule. Therefore, most xenobiotic compounds are acted upon by a process 
called cometabolism , which occurs concurrently with normal metabolic processes. An interesting 
example of cometabolism is provided by the white rot fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium , 
which has been promoted for the treatment of hazardous organochlorides such as PCBs, DDT, and 
c hl orodi o xins . This fun gus uses dead w ood as a carbo n source an d has an enzyme s y s te m that 
breaks down wood lignin, a degradation-resistant biopolymer that binds the cellulose in wood. 
Under appropriate conditions, this enzyme system attacks organochloride compounds and enables 
their mineralization.
The susceptibility of a xenobiotic hazardous waste compound to biodegradation depends upon its 
physical and chemical characteristics. Important physical characteristics include water solubility, 
hydrophobicity (aversion to water), volatility, and lipophilicity (affi  nity for lipids). In organic com-
pounds, certain structural groups—branched carbon chains, ether linkages, meta-substituted ben-
zene rings, chlorine, amines, methoxy groups, sulfonates, and nitro groups—impart particular 
resistance to biodegradation.
Microorganisms vary in their ability to degrade hazardous waste compounds; virtually never 
does a single microorganism have the ability to completely mineralize a waste compound. Abundant 
aerobic bacteria of the Pseudomonas  family are particularly adept at degrading synthetic com-
pounds such as biphenyl, naphthalene, DDT, and many other compounds. Actinomycetes , micro-
organisms that are morphologically similar to both bacteria and fungi, degrade a variety of organic 
compounds including degradation-resistant alkanes and lignocellulose, as well as pyridines, phe-
nols, nonchlorinated aryls, and chlorinated aryls. 
Fungi are particularly noted for their ability to attack long-chain and complex hydrocarbons, and 
are more successful than bacteria in the initial attack on PCB compounds. The potential of the white 
rot fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium , to degrade biodegradation-resistant compounds, espe-
cially organochloride species, was previously noted.
20.16.2 E COTOXICOLOGY  OF HAZARDOUS  WASTES
Biologically, the greatest concern with wastes has to do with their toxic effects on animals, plants, 
and microbes. Virtually all hazardous waste substances are poisonous to a degree, some extremely 
so. Toxicities vary markedly with the physical and chemical nature of the waste, the matrix in which 
it is contained, the type and condition of the species exposed, and the manner, degree, and time of 
exposure.
Ecotoxicology , the study of how chemicals affect organisms in the environment, is an important 
part of the risk assessment of hazardous wastes.5 Eco-epidemiology  is a more broadly based area that 
seeks to evaluate over a relatively long term how the health of a biological community is affected by 
the physical and chemical nature of the environment with respect to foreign chemical substances in 
it. A key aspect of the ecotoxicology of hazardous wastes is the determination of the concentration at 
which chemicals begin to have signifi  cant effects on organisms in the environment. The ecotoxicities 
of products likely to be released to the environment are evaluated starting with a quantitative (QSAR) 
approach (a largely computational exercise) and progressing through acute, chronic, and model eco-
system testing (a tiered effects process) in order to evaluate the likely effects of compounds upon 
survival, growth, and reproduction of organisms. The expense and complexity of testing increase 
with higher levels in the tiered approach and later tests may not be required if those earlier in the Nature, Sources, and Environmental Chemistry of Hazardous Wastes 569
sequence show that there is unlikely to be a problem. Only the most widely used compounds are 
subject to expensive chronic toxicity or model ecosystem tests.
20.17 HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES IN TERRORISM
A wide variety of substances used in everyday commerce or made specifi  cally for their destructive 
or toxic effects have a high potential for use in terrorist attacks. Some of these substances are dis-
cussed here. Toxic substances with potential for use in terrorist incidents are discussed further in 
Chapter 24.
Substances used to attack people can be distributed through a number of conduits including air, 
food, drinking water, and pharmaceuticals. They are especially effective against concentrated 
groups of people, such as those gathered in shopping malls, theaters, or transportation facilities. In 
part because they are readily diluted to nonhazardous levels by wind and air currents, chemical 
agents are of less concern for attacks on dispersed populations out of doors than are biological

widely from just a few grams of nerve gas to hundreds of kilograms of ammonia or chlorine. Because 
of chemophobic concerns of the general public, even a relatively harmless chemical attack is likely 
to cause widespread panic to exposed individuals. One can imagine the consternation that could be 
caused by an ominous looking, but largely harmless, fog of ammonium chloride produced by simul-
taneous release of ammonia and hydrogen chloride gas in a crowded area. 
Hazardous chemicals that have the potential for use in terrorist attacks include the following:
 1. Toxic and otherwise hazardous industrial chemicals
 2. Military poisons
 3. Combustible substances and oxidizers
 4. Corrosive substances
 5. Highly reactive substances including explosives
The use of relatively large quantities of hazardous industrial chemicals is a characteristic of all 
modern industrialized societies. The potential hazards posed by such chemicals are exemplifi  ed by 
the catastrophic Bhopal, India, incident of 1984 that killed 3500 people when methyl isocyanate was 
accidentally released. Elemental chlorine and phosgene are widely used and were among the fi  rst 
military poisons employed in World War I. A more recent example of large-scale poisoning by a 
hazardous chemical occurred in the Chuandongbei natural gas fi  eld of southwestern China in 
December 2003, when a drill penetrated a highly pressurized pocket of natural gas containing a 
high level of toxic hydrogen sulfi  de, H2S. Toxic gas spewing from the well killed at least 191 people 
including a high proportion of the population of Xiaoyang village, the community closest to the 
well. Approximately 600 people in the town of Zhonghe were treated for poisoning and thousands 
of people were evacuated. To prevent additional poisoning, the gas was ignited, creating a huge fi  re 
and converting the hydrogen sulfi  de to noxious, but much less toxic sulfur dioxide.
Industrial chemicals are very well controlled inside plant walls and incidents of harm from this 
source of chemicals are relatively rare. A greater hazard is posed by the transport of such chemicals 
by rail, truck, or other means. Major transportation accidents in which hazardous chemicals are 
released occur relatively frequently. Rail cars and trucks transporting such chemicals are vulnerable 
to terrorist attack and even hijacking that could result in exposure of human populations. In this 
respect, the practices of industrial ecology and green chemistry offer enormous potential for reduc-
ing the hazards. In many cases, hazardous chemical intermediates can be produced on site as needed 
and by just-in-time production, thereby eliminating the need to transport large quantities of such 
chemicals and preventing their accumulation in quantities that might pose hazards.
Substances that burn and oxidizers required for combustion are in widespread use and must 
be transported from sources to users. The potential of fl  ammable substances to cause death and 570 Environmental Chemistry
destruction was tragically illustrated by the 2001 attack on the New York World Trade Center in 
which the destructive agent was fl  ammable jet fuel. Flammable substances include gases and volatile 
liquids that can spread some distance from their source through conduits such as a subway tunnels 
and sewers. Pipelines through which large quantities of fl  ammable substances are transported are 
vulnerable to terrorist attack. Mixed with air, fl  ammable vapors can cause devastating explosions.
Oxidizers can greatly accelerate the burning of fl  ammable materials. This was illustrated tragi-
cally in the 1997 crash of a ValueJet airliner in the Florida Everglades in which sodium chlorate 
used for aircraft oxygen generators was placed in the luggage hold and provided an oxidizer that 
burned tires and other fl  ammable materials resulting in the crash. 
Corrosive substances that attack materials and fl  esh can be used in terrorist attacks. Acidic, 
dehydrating sulfuric acid has been used to blind people in criminal attacks. Acids and other corro-
sive substances can be used to attack infrastructure, such as communications equipment.
Explosives are the substances most widely used in terrorist attacks. Blasts from relatively small 
amounts of explosives can bring down aircraft. Much larger quantities have been used in some of 
the more prominent recent terrorist attacks including the 1995 bombing of the Murrah Federal 
Building in Oklahoma City and the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya.
Many kinds of explosives have been developed that can be used for illegal purposes. These 
include gunpowder, nitroglycerin (the explosive in dynamite), 2,4,6-TNT, 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triaza-
cyclohexane (RDX), and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). Structural formulas of several danger-
ous explosives are shown in Figure 20.6. Explosives can be made from readily available materials, 
especially a mixture of ammonium nitrate fertilizer with fuel oil, which was used in the destruction 
of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.
20.17.1 D ETECTION  OF HAZARDOUS  SUBSTANCES
The detection of explosives and other hazardous substances is extremely important in combating 
terrorist threats. Metal detectors and x-ray imaging, which have been the standard means for fi  nding 
weapons and bombs on airline passengers and in their luggage, are of limited use in detecting haz-
ardous substances. Stationary ion mobility spectrometers and chemiluminescence sensors can be 
used to detect residues of explosives such as RDX, PETN, or TNT. Typically, sampling is done by 
swabbing luggage; careful cleaning of luggage can reduce chances of detection. Nuclear quadrupole 
resonance (NQR), which produces a signal from the nuclei of atoms of 14N, which constitute 99.6% 
of naturally occurring nitrogen, is an especially promising explosives detection technique. The 
information it provides correlates with the functional groups in specifi  c kinds of explosives enabling 
their detection. Other technologies that hold promise for explosives detection include x-ray diffrac-
tion, microwave/millimeter wave scanners, and NQR.
NQR is an especially promising explosives detection technique because of its specifi  city for the 
detection of nitrogen found in all common explosives and because of its ability to detect explosives 
in con tainers and e v en land mines . I t produces a s i gnal fro m the n uc l e i o f ato ms o f 14N, which H

 constitute 99.6% of naturally occurring nitrogen. A pulse of radiofrequency radiation from a 
 transmitter coil excites the 14N spins to higher quantized energy levels and measurement of the 
 particular precession frequency that is followed as the nuclear spins return to their equilibrium 
 positions provides the identities and abundance of nitrogen-containing functional groups. This 
information correlates with specifi  c kinds of explosives enabling their detection.
One of the most sensitive means for detecting hazardous chemical substances that might 
be involved in attacks is “canine olfactory detection.” It consists of the use of dogs to sniff odors of 
substances at very low levels. This detection system makes use of the dogs’ approximately 220  million 
mucus-coated olfactory receptors (about 40 times as many as humans) by which they detect odors 
and is more sophisticated than any yet developed by humans. (However, for various reasons, includ-
ing the desire to get rewards, dogs sometime exhibit the temperamental and  unpredictable nature 
often attributed to modern computerized instruments and some humans. According to one authorita-
tive source quoting an expert in canine olfaction, “Dogs lie. We know they do.”)6
20.17.2 R EMOVING  HAZARDOUS  AGENTS
An important aspect of resisting the effects of attacks by some hazardous substances is their removal, 
such as from contaminated air, or decontamination, such as from contaminated surfaces. Filters of 
various kinds can be employed to remove particles from both air and water. Adsorbents including 
activated carbon and molecular sieves can be used to sequester molecular contaminants. Liquids 
and solutions that can absorb contaminants or even react with them chemically can be used in 
scrubbers and packed sorbent reaction beds. 
A common problem in decontamination is that the materials used for this purpose may be incom-
patible with contaminated apparatus such as the electronic equipment. Although water sprayed as a 
fi ne mist into an atmosphere contaminated with chlorine, hydrogen fl  uoride, hydrogen sulfi  de, and 
other water-soluble materials can be an effective removal agent, it is hardly compatible with sensi-
tive computer equipment. Reactive foams might be somewhat more preferable in some cases. 
Robots offer some signifi  cant potential for counterterrorism such as in assessing attack sites, 
performing some types of search and rescue operations, inspecting containers, performing rou-
tine surveillance, and doing some of the labor-intensive and tedious work of decontamination. In 
this respect, robots are most likely to function as assistants to humans rather than substitutes for 
them. Although the idea of robots functioning entirely on their own in complex tasks such 
as decontamination remains a distant dream, continued advances in computerized control and 
artifi cial intelligence will undoubtedly increase the role of robots in counterterrorism activities of 
the future.

and Treatment
21.1 INTRODUCTION
Chapter 20 dealt with the nature and production of hazardous wastes. Clearly, there have been 
severe hazardous waste problems in the United States and throughout the world. Since the 1970s, 
much has been done to reduce and clean up hazardous wastes. Legislation dealing with wastes has 
been passed, regulations have been put forth and refi  ned, and numerous waste sites have been char-
acterized and treated. Many of the fi  nancial resources expended on hazardous wastes have been 
devoted to litigation in attempts to establish the identities and contributions of various parties to 
waste problems. This chapter discusses how environmental chemistry, industrial ecology, and green 
chemistry can be applied to hazardous waste management to develop measures by which chemical 
wastes can be minimized, recycled, treated, and disposed. In descending order of desirability, haz-
ardous waste management attempts to accomplish the following:
Do not produce it• 
If making it cannot be avoided, produce only minimum quantities• 
Recycle it• 
If it is produced and cannot be recycled, treat it, preferably in a way that makes it • 
nonhazardous
If it cannot be rendered nonhazardous, dispose of it in a safe manner• 
Once it is disposed, monitor it for leaching and other adverse effects• 
The effectiveness  of a hazardous waste management system is a measure of how well it reduces 
the quantities and hazards of wastes. As shown in Figure 21.1, the best management option consists 
of measures that prevent generation of wastes. Next in order of desirability is recovery and recycling 
of waste constituents. Next is destruction and treatment with conversion to nonhazardous waste 
forms. The least desirable option is disposal of hazardous materials in storage or landfi  ll.
21.2 WASTE REDUCTION AND MINIMIZATION
During recent years, substantial efforts have been made in reducing the quantities of wastes and, 
therefore, the burden of dealing with wastes. Much of this effort has been the result of legislation 
and regulations restricting wastes, along with the resulting concerns over possible legal actions and 
lawsuits. In many cases—and ideally in all—minimizing the quantities of wastes produced is 
simply good business. Wastes are materials, materials have value and, therefore, all materials 
should be used for some benefi  cial purpose and not discarded as wastes, usually at a high cost for 
waste disposal.576 Environmental Chemistry
Industrial ecology is all about the effi  cient use of materials. Therefore, by its nature, a system of 
industrial ecology is also a system of waste reduction and minimization.1 In reducing quantities 
of wastes, it is important to take the broadest possible view. This is because dealing with one waste 
problem in isolation may simply create another. Early efforts to control air and water pollution 
resulted in problems from hazardous wastes isolated from industrial operations. A key aspect of 
industrial ecology is its approach based upon industrial systems as a whole, making such systems 
the best means of dealing with wastes by avoiding their production.
Many hazardous waste problems can be avoided at early stages by waste reduction  (cutting down 
quantities of wastes from their sources) and waste minimization  (utilization of treatment processes 
that reduce the quantities of wastes requiring ultimate disposal).2
Ways in which quantities of wastes can be reduced include source reduction, waste separation 
and concentration, resource recovery, and waste recycling. The most effective approaches to mini-
mizing wastes center around careful control of manufacturing processes, taking into consideration 
discharges and the potential for waste minimization at every step of manufacturing. Viewing the 
process as a whole (as outlined for a generalized chemical manufacturing process in Figure 21.2) 
often enables crucial identifi  cation of the source of a waste, such as a raw material impurity, cata-
lyst, or process solvent. Once a source is identifi  ed, it is much easier to take measures to eliminate 
or reduce the waste. The most effective approach to minimizing wastes is to emphasize waste mini-
mization as an integral part of plant design.
Modifi  cations of the manufacturing process can yield substantial waste reduction. Some such 
modifi  cations are of a chemical nature. Changes in chemical reaction conditions can minimize 
production of by-product hazardous substances. In some cases, potentially hazardous catalysts, such 
as those formulated from toxic substances, can be replaced by catalysts that are nonhazardous or

Many kinds of waste streams are candidates for minimization. As examples, such waste streams 
identifi  e d  a t  U . S .  G o v e r n m e n t  f e d e r a l  f a c i l i t i e s  h a v e  i n c l u d e d  s o l v e n t s  u s e d  f o r  c l e a n i n g  a n d  
degreasing, spent motor oil from gasoline and diesel engines, leftover and waste paint thinners, 
antifreeze/antiboil engine cooling formulations, batteries, inks, exposed photographic fi  lm, 
and pathology wastes. The sources of the wastes are as varied as the waste streams themselves. 
Motor pool maintenance garages generate used motor oil and spent coolants. Hospitals, clinics, 
and medical laboratories generate pathology wastes. Aircraft maintenance depots where aircraft 
and their parts are cleaned, chemically stripped of paint and coatings, repainted, and electroplated 
generate large quantities of effl  uents including organic materials. Other facilities generating 
wastes include equipment and arms maintenance facilities, photo developing and printing labora-
tories, paint shops, and arts and crafts shops.
A crucial part of the process for reducing and minimizing wastes is the development of a mate-
rial balance, which is an integral part of the practice of industrial ecology. Such a balance addresses 
various aspects of waste streams, including sources, identifi  cation, and quantities of wastes and 
methods and costs of handling, treatment, recycling, and disposal. Priority waste streams can then 
be subjected to detailed process investigations to obtain the information needed to reduce wastes.
There are encouraging signs of progress in the area of waste minimization. All major companies 
have initiated programs to minimize quantities of wastes produced. T ypically, more than 97% of oil-
based petroleum refi  nery waste sludges that used to be discarded to landfi  ll are now subjected to coking 
to yield useful hydrocarbon liquids and gases and coke, a solid carbon material with commercial value. 
Similar successes have been achieved with what were once waste products in a number of industries.
21.3 RECYCLING
Wherever possible, recycling and reuse should be accomplished on-site because it avoids having to 
move wastes and because a process that produces recyclable materials is often the most likely to have 
use for them. The four broad areas in which something of value may be obtained from wastes are the 
following:
Direct recycle as raw material to the generator, as with the return to feedstock of raw • 
materials not completely consumed in a synthesis process
Transfer as a raw material to another process; a substance that is a waste product from one • 
process may serve as a raw material for another, sometimes in an entirely different industryReclaimed

21.3.1 E XAMPLES  OF RECYCLING
Recycling of scrap industrial impurities and products occurs on a large scale with a number of dif-
ferent materials. Most of these materials are not hazardous but, as with most large-scale industrial 
operations, their recycling may involve the use or production of hazardous substances. Some of the 
more important examples are the following:
Ferrous metals•  composed primarily of iron and used largely as feedstock for electric-arc 
furnaces
Nonferrous metals• , including aluminum (which ranks next to iron in terms of quantities 
recycled), copper and copper alloys, zinc, lead, cadmium, tin, silver, and mercury
Metal compounds• , such as metal salts
Inorganic substances•  including alkaline compounds (such as sodium hydroxide used to 
remove sulfur compounds from petroleum products), acids (steel pickling liquor where impu-
rities permit reuse), and salts (e.g., ammonium sulfate from coal coking used as fertilizer)
Glass• , which makes up about 10% of municipal refuse
Paper• , commonly recycled from municipal refuse
Plastic• , consisting of a variety of moldable polymeric materials and composing a major 
constituent of municipal wastes
Rubber• 
Organic substances• , especially solvents and oils, such as hydraulic and lubricating oils
Catalysts•  from chemical synthesis or petroleum processing
Materials with • agricultural uses , such as waste lime or phosphate-containing sludges used 
to treat and fertilize acidic soils
21.3.2 W ASTE OIL UTILIZATION  AND RECOVERY
Waste oil  generated from lubricants and hydraulic fl  uids is one of the more commonly recycled 
materials. Annual production of waste oil in the United States is of the order of 4 billion liters. 
Around half of this amount is burned as fuel and lesser quantities are recycled or disposed as waste. 
The collection, recycling, treatment, and disposal of waste oil are all complicated by the fact that it 
comes from diverse, widely dispersed sources and contains several classes of potentially hazardous 
contaminants. These are divided between organic constituents (PAHs, chlorinated hydrocarbons) 
and inorganic constituents (aluminum, chromium, and iron from wear of metal parts; barium and 
zinc from oil additives; lead from leaded gasoline).
21.3.2.1 Recycling Waste Oil
The processes used to convert waste oil to a feedstock hydrocarbon liquid for lubricant formulation 
are illustrated in Figure 21.3. The fi  rst of these uses distillation to remove water and light ends that 
have come from condensation and contaminant fuel. The second, or processing, step may be a 
vacuum distillation in which the three products are oil for further processing, a fuel oil cut, and a 
heavy residue. The processing step may also employ treatment with a mixture of solvents including 
isopropyl and butyl alcohols and methylethyl ketone to dissolve the oil and leave contaminants as a 
sludge; or contact with sulfuric acid to remove inorganic contaminants followed by treatment with 
clay to take out acid and contaminants that cause odor and color. The third step shown in Figure 21.3 
employs vacuum distillation to separate lubricating oil stocks from a fuel fraction and heavy resi-
due. This phase of treatment may also involve hydrofi  nishing, treatment with clay, and fi  ltration.Industrial Ecology for Waste Minimization, Utilization, and Treatment 579
21.3.2.2 Waste Oil Fuel
For economic reasons, waste oil that is to be used for fuel is given minimal treatment of a physical 
nature, including settling, removal of water, and fi  ltration. Metals in waste fuel oil become highly 
concentrated in its fl  y ash, which may be hazardous.
21.3.3 W ASTE SOLVENT  RECOVERY  AND RECYCLE
The recovery and recycling of waste solvents has some similarities to the recycling of waste oil and 
is also an important enterprise. Among the many solvents listed as hazardous wastes and recoverable 
from wastes are dichloromethane, tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, 
benzene, liquid alkanes, 2-nitropropane, methylisobutyl ketone, and cyclohexanone. For rea-
sons of both economics and pollution control, many industrial processes that use solvents are 
equipped for solvent recycle. The basic scheme for solvent reclamation and reuse is shown in 
Figure 21.4.
Because of their impact on material use and environmental effects, solvents are given a 
hi gh pri ori ty in the practi ce o f green chemistry . A n umber o f operati ons are used in so l v ent  
recovery and purifi  cation. Entrained solids are removed by settling, fi  ltration, or centrifugation. 
Drying agents may be used to remove water from solvents, and various adsorption techniques 
and  chemical treatment may be required to free the solvent from specifi  c impurities. Fractional 
distillation, often requiring several distillation steps, is the most important operation in 
 solvent purifi  cati on and recy c lin g . I t is used to separate so l v en ts from impuri ti es, w ater , and  
other solvents.Waste oi l A dditives

21.3.4 R ECOVERY  OF WATER FROM WASTEWATER
It is often desirable to reclaim water from wastewater. This is especially true in regions where water 
is in short supply. Even where water is abundant, water recycling is desirable to minimize the 
amount of water that is discharged.
A little more than half of the water used in the United States is consumed by agriculture, primarily 
for irrigation. Steam-generating power plants consume about one-fourth of the water, and other uses, 
including manufacturing and domestic uses, account for the remainder. 
The three major manufacturing consumers of water are chemicals and allied products, paper and 
allied products, and primary metals. These industries use water for cooling, processing, and boilers. 
Their potential for water reuse is high and their total consumption of water is projected to drop in 
future years as recycling becomes more common. 
The degree of treatment required for reuse of wastewater depends upon its application. Water 
used for industrial quenching and washing usually requires the least treatment, and wastewater from 
some other processes may be suitable for these purposes without additional treatment. At the other 
end o f the scale, boiler makeup w ater , potab le ( drinking ) w ater , w ater used to directl y recharge 
aquifers, and water that people will directly contact (in boating, water skiing, and similar activities) 
must be of very high quality.
The treatment processes applied to wastewater for reuse and recycle depend upon both the char-
acteristics of the wastewater and its intended uses. Solids can be removed by sedimentation and 
fi ltration. BOD is reduced by biological treatment, including trickling fi  lters and activated sludge 
treatment. For uses conducive to the growth of nuisance algae, nutrients may have to be removed. 
The easiest of these to handle is nutrient phosphate, which can be precipitated with lime. Nitrogen 
can be removed by denitrifi  cation processes.
Two of the major problems with industrial water recycling are heavy metals and dissolved toxic 
organic species. Heavy metals may be removed by ion exchange or precipitation by base or sulfi  de. 
The organic species are usually removed with activated carbon fi  ltration. Some organic species are 
biologically degraded by bacteria in biological wastewater treatment.
One of the greater sources of potentially hazardous wastewater arises from oil/water separators 
at wash racks where manufactured parts and materials are washed. Because of the use of surfactants 
and solvents in the washwater, the separated water tends to contain emulsifi  ed oil that is incom-
pletely separated in an oil/water separator. In addition, the sludge that accumulates at the bottom of 
the separator may contain hazardous constituents, including heavy metals and some hazardous 
organic constituents. Several measures that include the incorporation of good industrial ecology 
practice may be taken to eliminate these problems. One such measure is to eliminate the use of 
surfactants and solvents that tend to contaminate the water, and to use surfactants and solvents that 
are more amenable to separation and treatment. Another useful measure is to treat the water to 
remove harmful constituents and recycle it. This not only conserves water and reduces disposal 
costs, but also enables recycling of surfactants and other additives.
The ultimate water quality is achieved by processes that remove solutes from water, leaving pure 
H2O. A combination of activated carbon treatment to remove organics, cation exchange to remove 
dissolved cations, and anion exchange for dissolved anions can provide very high quality water from 
wastewater. Reverse osmosis (see Chapter 8) can accomplish the same objective. However, these 
processes generate spent activated carbon, ion-exchange resins that require regeneration, and con-
centrated brines (from reverse osmosis) that require disposal, all of which have the potential to end 
up as hazardous wastes.
21.4 PHYSICAL METHODS OF WASTE TREATMENT
This section addresses predominantly physical methods for waste treatment and the following 
 section addresses methods that utilize chemical processes. It should be kept in mind that most waste Industrial Ecology for Waste Minimization, Utilization, and Treatment 581
treatment measures have both physical and chemical aspects. The appropriate treatment technology 
for hazardous wastes obviously depends upon the nature of the wastes, which may vary in physical 
form, density, chemical composition, solubility in water, solubility in organic solvents, volatility, 
and other characteristics.
As shown in Figure 21.5, waste treatment may occur at three major levels— primary , secondary , 
and polishing —somewhat analogous to the treatment of wastewater (see Chapter 8). Primary treat-
ment is usually preparation for further treatment, although it can result in the removal of by-products 
and reduction of the quantity and hazard of the waste. Secondary treatment detoxifi  es, destroys, and 
removes hazardous constituents. Polishing usually refers to treatment of water removed from wastes 
before discharge. The term may also apply to the treatment of other products so that they may be 
safely discharged or recycled.

21.4.1.1 Phase Separations
The most straightforward means of physical treatment involves separation of components of a 
mixture that are already in two different phases. Sedimentation  and decanting  are easily accom-
plished with simple equipment. In many cases, the separation must be aided by mechanical means, 
particularly fi l t r a t i o n  or centrifugation . Flotation  is used to bring suspended organic matter or 
fi nely divided particles to the surface of a suspension. In the process of dissolved air fl  otation  
(DAF), air is dissolved in the suspending medium under pressure and comes out of solution when 
the pressure is released as minute air bubbles attached to suspended particles, which causes the 
particles to fl  oat to the surface.
An important and often diffi  cult waste treatment step is emulsion breaking  in which colloidal-
sized emulsions  are caused to aggregate and settle from suspension. Agitation, heat, acid, and the 
addition of coagulants  consisting of organic polyelectrolytes, or inorganic substances such as an 
aluminum salt, may be used to cause the particles to stick together and settle out.
21.4.1.2 Phase Transition
A second major class of physical separation is that of phase transition  in which a material changes 
from one physical phase to another. It is best exemplifi  ed by distillation , which is used in treating 
and recycling solvents, waste oil, aqueous phenolic wastes, xylene contaminated with paraffi  n from 
histological laboratories, and mixtures of ethylbenzene and styrene. Distillation produces distilla-
tion bottoms  (still bottoms), which are often hazardous and polluting. These consist of unevaporated 
solids, semisolid tars, and sludges from distillation. Specifi  c examples are distillation bottoms from 
the production of acetaldehyde from ethylene (hazardous waste number K009) and still bottoms 
from toluene reclamation distillation in the production of disulfoton (K036). The landfi  ll disposal of 
these and other hazardous distillation bottoms, once widely practiced, is now severely limited.
Evaporation  is usually employed to remove water from an aqueous waste to concentrate it. 
A special case of this technique is thin-fi  lm evaporation  in which volatile constituents are removed 
by heating a thin layer of liquid or sludge waste spread on a heated surface.
Drying  is removal of solvent or water from a solid or semisolid (sludge) or the removal of solvent 
from a liquid or suspension—is a very important operation because water is often the major con-
stituent of waste products, such as sludges obtained from emulsion breaking. In freeze drying , the 
solvent, usually water, is sublimed from a frozen material. Hazardous waste solids and sludges are 
dried to reduce the quantity of waste, to remove solvent or water that might interfere with sub-
sequent treatment processes, and to remove hazardous volatile constituents. Dewatering can often 
be improved with addition of a fi  lter aid, such as diatomaceous Earth, during the fi  ltration step.
Stripping  is a means of separating volatile components from less volatile ones in a liquid mixture 
by the partitioning of the more volatile materials to a gas phase of air or steam (steam stripping). 
The gas phase is introduced into the aqueous solution or suspension containing the waste in a strip-
ping tower that is equipped with trays or packed to provide maximum turbulence and contact 
between the liquid and gas phases. The two major products are condensed vapor and a stripped bot-
toms residue. Examples of two volatile components that can be removed from water by air stripping 
are benzene and dichloromethane. Air stripping can also be used to remove ammonia from water 
that has been treated with a base to convert ammonium ion to volatile ammonia.
Physical precipitation  is used here as a term to describe processes in which a solid forms from a 
solute in solution as a result of a physical change in the solution, as compared to chemical precipita-
tion (see Section 21.5) in which a chemical reaction in solution produces an insoluble material. 
Cooling the solution, evaporation of solvent, or alteration of solvent composition may cause physical 
precipitation. The most common type of physical precipitation by solvent alteration occurs when Industrial Ecology for Waste Minimization, Utilization, and Treatment 583
a water-miscible organic solvent is added to an aqueous solution so that the solubility of a salt is 
lowered below its concentration in the solution.
21.4.1.3 Phase Transfer
Phase transfer  consists of the transfer of a solute in a mixture from one phase to another. An import-
ant type of phase transfer process is solvent extraction  in which a substance is transferred from solu-
tion in one solvent (usually water) to another (usually an organic solvent) without any chemical 
change. Solvents may be used for leaching  substances from solids or sludges. Solvent extraction and 
the major terms applicable to it are summarized in Figure 21.6. The same terms and general princi-
ples apply to leaching. A major application of solvent extraction to waste treatment has been in the 
removal of phenol from by-product water produced in coal coking, petroleum refi  ning, and chemical 
syntheses that involve phenol.
One of the more promising approaches to solvent extraction and leaching of hazardous wastes is 
the use of supercritical fl  uids , most commonly CO2, as extraction solvents. A supercritical fl  uid 
is one that has characteristics of both liquid and gas and consists of a substance above its critical 
temperature and pressure (31.1 ∞C and 73.8 atm, respectively, for CO2). After a substance has been 
extracted from a waste into a supercritical fl  uid at high pressure, the pressure can be released, result-
ing in separation of the substance extracted. The fl  uid can then be compressed again and recircu-
lated through the extraction system. Some possibilities for treatment of hazardous wastes by 
extraction with supercritical CO2 include removal of organic contaminants from wastewater, extrac-
tion of organohalide pesticides from soil, extraction of oil from emulsions used in aluminum and 
steel processing, and regeneration of spent activated carbon. Waste oils contaminated with PCBs, 
metals, and water can be purifi  ed using supercritical ethane.
Transfer of a substance from a solution to a solid phase is called sorption . The most important 
sorbent is activated carbon , w hi c h, in so me cases, is used f or co mp l e te treatmen t o f hazardo us 
wastes as well as pretreatment of waste streams going into processes such as reverse osmosis to 
improve treatment effi  ciency and reduce fouling. Effl  uents from other treatment processes, such as 
biological treatment of degradable organic solutes in water, can be polished with activated carbon. 
Activated carbon sorption is most effective for removing from water those hazardous waste materi-
als that are poorly water-soluble and that have high molar masses, such as xylene, naphthalene 
(U165), chlorinated hydrocarbons, phenol (U188), and aniline. Activated carbon does not work well 
for organic compounds that are highly water-soluble or polar.
Solids other than activated carbon can be used for sorption of contaminants from liquid wastes. 
These include synthetic resins composed of organic polymers and mineral substances. Of the 
 latter, clay is employed to remove impurities from waste lubricating oils in some oil recycling 
processes.

21.4.1.4 Molecular Separation
A third major class of physical separation is molecular separation , often based upon membrane 
processes  in which dissolved contaminants or solvent pass through a size-selective membrane under 
pressure. The products are a relatively pure solvent phase (usually water) and a concentrate enriched 
in the solute impurities. The common membrane processes are discussed in Section 8.6 and sum-
marized in Table 8.1. Ultrafi  ltration and hyperfi  ltration are especially useful for concentrating sus-
pended oil, grease, and fi  ne solids in water. They also serve to concentrate solutions of large organic 
molecules and heavy metal ion complexes.
21.5 CHEMICAL TREATMENT: AN OVERVIEW
The applicability of chemical treatment to wastes depends upon the chemical properties of the 
waste constituents, particularly acid–base, oxidation–reduction, precipitation, and complexation 
behavior; reactivity; fl  ammability/combustibility; corrosivity; and compatibility with other wastes. 
The major unit operations for chemical waste treatment are the following:
Acid/base neutralization• 
Chemical extraction and leaching• 
Ion exchange• 
Chemical precipitation• 
Oxidation• 
Reduction• 
Some of the more sophisticated means available for treatment of wastes have been developed for 
pesticide disposal.
21.5.1 A CID–BASE NEUTRALIZATION
Waste acids and bases are treated by neutralization :
 H+ + OH- Æ H2O (21.1)
Although simple in principle, neutralization can present some problems in practice. These include 
evolution of volatile contaminants, mobilization of soluble substances, excessive heat generated by 
the neutralization reaction, and corrosion to apparatus. By adding too much or too little of the neu-
tralizing agent, it is possible to get a product that is too acidic or basic. Lime, Ca(OH)2, is widely 
used as a base for treating acidic wastes. Because of lime’s limited solubility, solutions of excess 
lime do not reach extremely high pH values. Sulfuric acid, H2SO4, is a relatively inexpensive acid 
for treating alkaline wastes. However, addition of too much sulfuric acid can produce highly acidic 
products; for some applications, acetic acid, CH3COOH, is preferable. As noted above, acetic acid 
is a weak acid and an excess of it does little harm. It is also a natural product and biodegradable.
Neutralization, or pH adjustment, is often required prior to the application of other waste treat-
ment processes. Processes that may require neutralization include oxidation/reduction, activated 
carbon sorption, wet air oxidation, stripping, and ion exchange. Microorganisms usually require a 
pH in the range of 6–9, so neutralization may be required prior to biochemical treatment.
21.5.1.1 Acid Recovery
Rather than neutralizing acid, in some cases, it may be recovered for its economic value. Acid recov-
ery is in keeping with the best practice of green chemistry. An example of acid recovery is the use 
of trioctyl phosphate to recover acetic acid and nitric acid from a waste acid mixture of these acids 
and H3PO4 produced in some processes such as etching in the production of liquid crystals.Industrial Ecology for Waste Minimization, Utilization, and Treatment 585

21.5.2 C HEMICAL  PRECIPITATION
Chemical precipitation  is used in hazardous waste treatment primarily for the removal of heavy 
metal ions from water as shown below for the chemical precipitation of cadmium:
 Cd2+(aq) + HS-(aq) Æ CdS( s) + H+(aq) (21.2)
21.5.2.1 Precipitation of Metals
The most widely used means of precipitating metal ions is by the formation of hydroxides such as 
chromium(III) hydroxide:
 Cr3+ + 3OH- Æ Cr(OH)3 (21.3)
The source of hydroxide ion is a base (alkali), such as lime [Ca(OH)2], sodium hydroxide (NaOH), 
or sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). Most metal ions tend to produce basic salt precipitates, such as basic 
copper(II) sulfate, CuSO4 . 3Cu(OH)2, which is formed as a solid when hydroxide is added to a solu-
tion containing Cu2+ and SO42- ions. The solubilities of many heavy metal hydroxides reach a mini-
mum value, often at a pH in the range of 9–11, then increase with increasing pH values due to the 
formation of soluble hydroxo complexes, as illustrated by the following reaction:
 Zn(OH)2(s) + 2OH-(aq) Æ Zn(OH)42
 (aq) (21.4)
The chemical precipitation method that is used most is precipitation of metals as hydroxides 
and basic salts with lime. Sodium carbonate can be used to precipitate hydroxides [Fe(OH)3 . xH2O], 
carbonates (CdCO3), or basic carbonate salts [2PbCO3 . Pb(OH)2]. The carbonate anion produces 
hydroxide by virtue of its hydrolysis reaction with water:
 CO32- + H2O Æ HCO3- + OH- (21.5)
Carbonate, alone, does not give as high a pH as do alkali metal hydroxides, which may have to 
be used to precipitate metals that form hydroxides only at relatively high pH values.
The solubilities of some heavy metal sulfi  des are extremely low, so precipitation by H2S or other 
sulfi des (see Reaction 21.2) can be a very effective means of treatment. Hydrogen sulfi  de is a toxic 
gas that is itself considered to be a hazardous waste (U135). Iron(II) sulfi  de (ferrous sulfi  de) can be 
used as a safe source of sulfi  de ion to produce sulfi  de precipitates with other metals that are less 
soluble than FeS. However, toxic H2S can be produced when metal sulfi  de wastes contact acid:
 MS + 2H+ Æ M2+ + H2S (21.6)586 Environmental Chemistry
Some metals can be precipitated from solution in the elemental metal form by the action of a 
reducing agent such as sodium borohydride:
 4Cu2+ + NaBH4 + 2H2O Æ 4Cu + NaBO2 + 8H+ (21.7)
or with more active metals in a process called cementation :
 Cd2+ + Zn Æ Cd + Zn2+ (21.8)
Regardless of the method used to precipitate a metal, the form of the metal in the waste solution 
can be an important consideration. Chelated metals can be especially diffi  cult to remove.
21.5.2.2 Coprecipitation of Metals
In some cases, advantage may be taken of the phenomenon of coprecipitation to remove metals 
from wastes. A good example of this application is the coprecipitation of lead from battery indus-
try wastewater with iron(III) hydroxide. Raising the pH of such a wastewater consisting of dilute 
sulfuric acid and contaminated with Pb2+ ion precipitates lead as several species, including PbSO4, 
Pb(OH)2, and Pb(OH)2 . 2PbCO3. In the presence of iron(III) , gelatinous Fe( OH)3 forms, which 
coprecipitates the lead, leading to signifi  cantly greater lead removal, typically to below 0.2 ppm.
21.5.3 O XIDATION –REDUCTION
As shown by the reactions in   Table 21.1, oxidation  and reduction  can be used for the treatment and 
removal of a variety of inorganic and organic wastes. Some waste oxidants can be used to treat 
oxidizable wastes in water and cyanides. Ozone, O3, is a strong oxidant that can be generated on-site 
by an electrical discharge through dry air or oxygen. Ozone employed as an oxidant gas at levels of 
1–2 wt% in air and 2–5 wt% in oxygen has been used to treat a large variety of oxidizable contami-
nants, effl  uents, and wastes including wastewater and sludges containing oxidizable constituents. 
It is also used to partially oxidize organic waste solutes in water to make them more amenable to 
biological treatment.
Fenton oxidation  is also used to oxidize organic substances in water, often as a fi  nal polishing 
step prior to release of the treated wastewater. The Fenton process entails adding iron(II) salts, such

as FeSO4, acidifi  cation, addition of hydrogen peroxide, and acid neutralization. Hydrogen peroxide 
reacts with iron(II),
 Fe(II) + H2O2 Æ Fe(III) + OH- + HO∑ (4.77)
to generate highly reactive hydroxyl radical, HO ∑, which oxidizes even refractory organic materials. 
A disadvantage of Fenton treatment is the iron-containing sludge that is generated when the acidic 
reaction mixture is neutralized.
21.5.4 E LECTROLYSIS
As shown in Figure 21.7, electrolysis  is a process in which one species in solution (usually a metal 
ion) is reduced by electrons at the cathode  and another gives up electrons to the anode  and is oxi-
dized there. In hazardous waste applications, electrolysis is most widely used in the recovery of 
cadmium, copper, gold, lead, silver, and zinc. Metal recovery by electrolysis is made more diffi  cult 
by the presence of cyanide ion, which stabilizes metals in solution as the cyanide complexes, such 
as Ni(CN)42-.
Electrolytic removal of contaminants from solution can be by direct electrodeposition, particu-
larly of reduced metals, and as the result of secondary reactions of electrolytically generated pre-
cipitating agents. A specifi  c example of both is the electrolytic removal of both cadmium and nickel 
from wastewater contaminated by nickel/cadmium battery manufactured using fi  brous carbon elec-
trodes. At the cathode, cadmium is removed directly by reduction to the metal:
 Cd2+ + 2e- Æ Cd (21.9)
At relatively high cathodic potentials, hydroxide is formed by the electrolytic reduction of 
water:
 2H2O + 2e- Æ 2OH- + H2 (21.10)
or by the reduction of molecular oxygen, if it is present:
 2H2O + O2 + 4e- Æ 4OH- (21.11)
Cu2+ +  2e–   Æ   Cu H2O   Æ   1–2 O2 + 2H+ + 2e–
Net reaction:  Cu2+ + H2O   Æ   Cu + 1–2 O2 + 2H+– +Cathode 
Anode 
FIGURE 21.7 Electrolysis of copper solution.588 Environmental Chemistry
If the localized pH at the cathode surface becomes suffi  ciently high, cadmium can be precipitated 
and removed as colloidal Cd(OH)2. The direct electrodeposition of nickel is too slow to be signifi  cant, 
but it is precipitated as solid Ni(OH)2 at pH values above 7.5 from OH- generated at the cathode.
Cyanide, which is often present as an ingredient of electroplating baths with metals such as cad-
mium and nickel, can be removed by oxidation with electrolytically generated elemental chlorine at 
the anode. Chlorine is generated by the anodic oxidation of added chloride ion:
 2Cl- Æ Cl2 + 2e- (21.12)
The electrolytically generated chlorine then breaks down cyanide by a series of reactions for which 
the overall reaction is the following:
 2CN- + 5Cl2 + 8OH- Æ 10Cl- + N2 + 2CO2 + 4H2O (21.13)
21.5.5 H YDROLYSIS
One of the ways to dispose of chemicals that are reactive with water is to allow them to react with 
water under controlled conditions, a process called hydrolysis . Inorganic chemicals that can be tre-
ated by hydrolysis include metals that react with water; metal carbides, hydrides, amides, alk-
oxides, and halides; and nonmetal oxyhalides and sulfi  des. Examples of the treatment of these classes 
of inorganic species are given in Table 21.2.
Organic chemicals may also be treated by hydrolysis. For example, toxic acetic anhydride is 
hydrolyzed to relatively safe acetic acid:

21.5.6 C HEMICAL  EXTRACTION  AND LEACHING
Chemical extraction  or leaching  in hazardous waste treatment is the removal of a hazardous con-
stituent by chemical reaction with an extractant in solution. Poorly soluble heavy metal salts can be 
extracted by reaction of the salt anions with H+ as illustrated by the following:
 PbCO3 + H+ Æ Pb2+ + HCO3- (21.15)

Alkoxides (sodium ethoxide) NaOC2H5 + H2O Æ NaOH + C2H5OHIndustrial Ecology for Waste Minimization, Utilization, and Treatment 589
Acids also dissolve basic organic compounds such as amines and aniline. Extraction with acids 
should be avoided if cyanides or sulfi  des are present to prevent formation of toxic hydrogen cyanide 
or hydrogen sulfi  de. Nontoxic weak acids are usually the safest to use. These include acetic acid, 
CH3COOH, and the acid salt, NaH2PO4.
Chelating agents, such as dissolved EDTA (HY3-), dissolve insoluble metal salts by forming 
soluble species with metal ions:
 FeS + HY3- Æ FeY2- + HS- (21.16)
Heavy metal ions in soil contaminated by hazardous wastes may be present in a coprecipitated 
form with insoluble iron(III) and manganese(IV) oxides, Fe2O3 and MnO2, respectively. These 
oxides can be dissolved by reducing agents, such as solutions of sodium dithionate/citrate or hydrox-
ylamine. This results in the production of soluble Fe2+ and Mn2+ and the release of heavy metal ions, 
such as Cd2+ or Ni2+, which are removed with the water.
21.5.7 I ON EXCHANGE
Ion exchange  is a means of removing cations or anions from solution onto a solid resin, which can 
be regenerated by treatment with acids, bases, or salts. The greatest use of ion exchange in haz-
ardous waste treatment is for the removal of low levels of heavy metal ions from wastewater:
 2H+-{CatExchr} + Cd2+ Æ Cd2+-{CatExchr}2 + 2H+ (21.17)
Ion exchange is employed in the metal plating industry to purify rinsewater and spent plating 
bath solutions. Cation exchangers are used to remove cationic metal species, such as Cu2+, from 
such solutions. Anion exchangers remove anionic cyanide metal complexes [e.g., Ni(CN)42-] and 
chromium(VI) species, such as CrO42-. Radionuclides may be removed from radioactive wastes and 
mixed waste by ion-exchange resins.
21.6 GREEN WASTE TREATMENT BY PHOTOLYSIS AND SONOLYSIS
Photolysis and sonolysis are discussed together because of some similarities in their modes of action 
and because they are both potentially green chemistry waste treatment processes that can be carried 
out without added reagents or with minimal quantities of relatively harmless reactants. Both provide 
means of introducing high energy into the treatment system (see Section 17.10); photolysis does so 
through the action of photons of ultraviolet light or even x-rays or gamma rays, whereas sonolysis 
does so by “phonons” of high frequency ultrasound. Both generate chemically reactive intermediate 
species that break down waste molecules.
Photolytic reactions  were discussed in Chapter 9. Photolysis  can be used to destroy a number of 
kinds of hazardous wastes. In such applications, it is most useful in breaking chemical bonds in 
refractory organic compounds. TCDD (see Section 7.11), one of the most troublesome and refractory 
of wastes, can be treated by ultraviolet light in the presence of hydrogen atom donors {H} resulting 
in reactions such as the following:
 O Cl 
Cl Cl 
Cl O + hν{H} O 
Cl Cl
Cl O H  
(21.18)590 Environmental Chemistry
As photolysis proceeds, the H –C bonds are broken, the C –O bonds are broken, and the fi  nal prod-
uct is a harmless organic polymer.
An initial photolysis reaction can result in the generation of reactive intermediates that partici-
pate in chain reactions  that lead to the destruction of a compound. By far, the most important reac-
tive intermediate is free radical HO∑. Solid titanium dioxide, TiO2, can be used as a photocatalyst 
leading to chain reactions involving active radicals. When the surface of TiO2 is irradiated with 
ultraviolet radiation, “holes” (h) are generated at sites where excited electrons ( e-) are produced:
 TiO2 + hν Æ TiO2(h + e-) (21.19)
The electrons can react with dissolved O2 to produce reactive O2-:
 TiO2(e-) + O2 Æ O2- (21.20)
The surface holes may take electrons from dissolved hydroxyl ion to produce reactive hydroxyl 
radicals on the TiO2 surface:
 TiO2(h) + OH- Æ HO∑ (21.21)
The hydroxyl radicals may then initiate reactions leading to the destruction of waste compounds or the 
TiO2(h) sites may initiate reactions directly with waste molecules by abstracting electrons from them.
In the example just cited, solid TiO2 acts as a sensitizer  to absorb radiation and generate reactive 
species that destroy wastes. Other sensitizers may be added to solution to generate hydroxyl radical 
for waste treatment. The addition of a chemical oxidant, such as potassium peroxydisulfate, K2S2O8, 
enhances destruction by oxidizing active photolytic products. One of the most common processes 
that entails generation of active hydroxyl radical is the Fenton reaction  involving iron(II) and hydro-
gen peroxide (see Reaction 4. 77). Sunlight impinging on water containing iron can generate both 
Fe(II) and H2O2 with the potential to use for waste treatment.
Hazardous waste substances other than TCDD that have been destroyed by photolysis are 
 herbicides including atrazine, 2,4-D, 2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy) propionic acid; 2,4-dichlorophenol; 
2,4,6-trichlorophenol; TNT; and PCBs.
Sonolysis  in water with ultrasound (typically 660 kHz frequency) generates reactive hydroxyl 
radical by the following reaction:
 UltrasoundHOH  HO + H ∑ ∑ ææææ Æ (21.22)
The hydroxyl radical undergoes reactions with waste compounds leading to their destruction. 
The waste solution may be saturated with O2 gas to facilitate waste oxidation. Sonolysis may be 
combined with photolysis for more effective waste destruction.
21.7 THERMAL TREATMENT METHODS
Thermal treatment of hazardous wastes can be used to accomplish most of the common objectives 
of waste treatment—volume reduction; removal of volatile, combustible, mobile organic matter; and 
destruction of toxic and pathogenic materials. The most widely applied means of thermal treatment 
of hazardous wastes is incineration . Incineration utilizes high temperatures, an oxidizing atmo-
sphere, and often turbulent combustion conditions to destroy wastes. Methods other than incinera-
tion that make use of high temperatures to destroy or neutralize hazardous wastes are discussed 
briefl y at the end of this section.Industrial Ecology for Waste Minimization, Utilization, and Treatment 591
21.7.1 I NCINERATION
Hazardous waste incineration will be defi  ned here as a process that involves exposure of the waste 
materials to oxidizing conditions at a high temperature, usually in excess of 900 ∞C. Normally, the 
heat required for incineration comes from the oxidation of organically bound carbon and hydrogen 
contained in the waste material or in supplemental fuel:
 C(organic) + O2 Æ CO2 + heat (21.23)
 4H(organic)  + O2 Æ 2H2O + heat (21.24)
These reactions destroy organic matter and generate  heat required for endothermic reactions, such 
as the breaking of C–Cl bonds in organochlorine compounds.
21.7.1.1 Incinerable Wastes
Ideally, incinerable wastes are predominantly organic materials that will burn with a heating value of 
at least 5000 Btu/lb and preferably over 8000 Btu/lb. Such heating values are readily attained with 
wastes having high contents of the most commonly incinerated waste organic substances, including 
methanol, acetonitrile, toluene, ethanol, amyl acetate, acetone, xylene, methyl ethyl ketone, adipic 
acid, and ethyl acetate. In some cases, however, it is desirable to incinerate wastes that will not burn 
alone and which require supplemental fuel , such as methane and petroleum liquids. Examples of 
such wastes are nonfl  ammable organochlorine wastes, some aqueous wastes, or soil in which the 
elimination of a particularly troublesome contaminant is worth the expense and trouble of incinerat-
ing it. Inorganic matter, water, and organic hetero element contents of liquid wastes are important in 
determining their incinerability.
21.7.2 H AZARDOUS  WASTE FUEL
Many industrial wastes, including hazardous wastes, are burned as hazardous waste fuel  for energy 
recovery in industrial furnaces and boilers and in incinerators for nonhazardous wastes, such as 
sewage sludge incinerators. This process is called coincineration , and more combustible wastes are 
utilized by it than are burned solely for the purpose of waste destruction. In addition to heat recov-
ery from combustible wastes, it is a major advantage to use an existing on-site facility for waste 
disposal rather than a separate hazardous waste incinerator. One of the greatest applications of 
coincineration is use of hazardous waste liquids containing organochlorine solvents and other pol-
lutants as fuel for the preparation of portland cement (see below).
21.7.3 I NCINERATION  SYSTEMS
The four major components of hazardous waste incineration systems are shown in Figure 21.8. Waste 
preparation  for liquid wastes may require fi  ltration, settling to remove solid material and water, 
blending to obtain the optimum incinerable mixture, or heating to decrease viscosity. Solids may 
require shredding and screening. Atomization is commonly used to feed liquid wastes. Several 
mechanical devices, such as rams and augers, are used to introduce solids into the incinerator.
The most common kinds of combustion chambers  are liquid injection, fi  xed hearth, rotary kiln, 
and fl  uidized bed. These types are discussed in more detail later in this section.
Often the most complex part of a hazardous waste incineration system is the air pollution control 
system , which involves several operations. The most common operations in air pollution control from 
hazardous waste incinerators are combustion gas cooling, heat recovery, quenching, particulate matter 
removal, acid gas removal, and treatment and handling of by-product solids, sludges, and liquids.
Hot ash is often quenched in water. Prior to disposal it may require dewatering and chemical 
stabilization. A major consideration with hazardous waste incinerators and the types of wastes 592 Environmental Chemistry
that are incinerated is the disposal problem posed by the ash, especially with respect to potential 
leaching of heavy metals.
21.7.4 T YPES OF INCINERATORS
Hazardous waste incinerators may be divided among the following, based upon type of combustion 
chamber:
Rotary kiln•  (about 40% of U.S. hazardous waste incinerator capacity) in which the primary 
combustion chamber is a rotating cylinder lined with refractory materials, and an after-
burner downstream from the kiln to complete destruction of the wastes.
Liquid injection•  incinerators  (also about 40% of U.S. hazardous waste incinerator capac-
ity) that burn pumpable liquid wastes dispersed as small droplets.
Fixed-hearth incinerators•  with single or multiple hearths upon which combustion of liquid 
or solid wastes occurs.
Fluidized-bed incinerators•  in which combustion of wastes is carried out on a bed of granu-
lar solid (such as limestone) held in a suspended (fl  uid-like) state by injection of air to 
remove pollutant acid gas and ash products.
Advanced design incinerators•  including plasma incinerators  that ma ke use of an extremely 
hot plasma of ionized gas injected through an electrical arc; electric reactors  that use 
resistance-heated incinerator walls at around 2200 ∞C to heat and pyrolyze wastes by radi-
ative heat transfer; infrared systems  that generate intense infrared radiation by passing 
electricity through silicon carbide resistance heating elements; molten salt combustion  
that uses a bed of molten sodium carbonate at about 900 ∞C to destroy the wastes and 
retain gaseous pollutants; and molten glass processes  that use a pool of molten glass to 
transfer heat to the waste and to retain products in a poorly leachable glass form.
21.7.5 C OMBUSTION  CONDITIONS
The key to effective incineration of hazardous wastes lies in the combustion conditions. These 
require (1) suffi  cient free oxygen in the combustion zone to ensure combustion of the wastes; (2) 
turbulence for thorough mixing of waste, oxidant, and (in cases where the waste does not have suf-
fi cient fuel content to be burned alone) supplemental fuel; (3) high combustion temperatures above Stack

about 900 ∞C to ensure that thermally resistant compounds do react; and (4) suffi  cient residence time 
(at least 2 s) to allow reactions to occur.
21.7.6 E FFECTIVENESS  OF INCINERATION
EPA standards for hazardous waste incineration are based upon the effectiveness of destruction of 
the principal organic hazardous constituents  (POHCs). Measurement of these compounds before 
and after incineration gives the destruction removal effi  ciency  (DRE) according to the formula
 in out

W-=¥
 (21.25)
where Win and Wout are the mass fl  ow rates of the POHC input and output (at the stack downstream 
from emission controls), respectively. U.S. EPA regulations call for destruction of 99.99% of POHCs 
and 99.9999% (“six nines”) destruction of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p-dioxin, commonly called 
TCDD or “dioxin.” 
21.7.7 W ET AIR OXIDATION
Organic compounds and oxidizable inorganic species can be oxidized by oxygen in aqueous solu-
tion. The source of oxygen usually is air. Rather extreme conditions of temperature and pressure 
are required, with a temperature range of 175–327 ∞C and a pressure range of 300–3000 psig 
(2070–20,700 kPa). The high pressures allow a high concentration of oxygen to be dissolved in 
the water and the high temperatures enable the reaction to occur.
Wet air oxidation has been applied to the destruction of cyanides in electroplating wastewaters. 
The oxidation reaction for sodium cyanide is the following:
 2Na+ + 2CN- + O2 + 4H2O Æ 2Na+ + 2HCO3- + 2NH3 (21.26)
Organic wastes can be oxidized in supercritical water, taking advantage of the ability of super-
critical fl  uids to dissolve organic compounds (see Section 21.4). Wastes are contacted with water and 
the mixture raised to a temperature and pressure required for supercritical conditions for water. 
Oxygen is then pumped in suffi  cient to oxidize the wastes. The process produces only small quanti-
ties of CO and no SO2 or NOx. It can be used to degrade PCBs, dioxins, organochlorine insecticides, 
benzene, urea, and numerous other materials.
21.7.8 UV-E NHANCED  WET OXIDATION
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can be used as an oxidant in solution assisted by ultraviolet radiation 
(hv). For the oxidation of organic species represented in general as {CH2O}, the overall reaction is
 2H2O2 + {CH2O} + hv Æ CO2 + 3H2O (21.27)
The ultraviolet radiation breaks chemical bonds and serves to form reactive oxidant species, such 
as HO∑.
21.7.9 D ESTRUCTION  OF HAZARDOUS  WASTES IN CEMENT  MANUFACTURE
One of the most effective means of destroying hazardous wastes is to use them as supplemental fuel 
in  th e  m an u f a c tur e  o f  p o rt l an d  c e m e n t .  In  thi s  a p p li c a ti o n ,  c e m e n t  m an u f a c tur e  i s  an  e x c e ll e n t  594 Environmental Chemistry
example of the practice of industrial ecology, destroying a waste and utilizing it as fuel.3 Portland 
cement is made by heating limestone, clay, and sand to a very high temperature such that the min-
eral mixture fuses, after which it is ground to the fi  n e  p o w d e r  th a t  c o m p o s e s  c e m e n t .  Wh e n  a  
cement kiln is cofi  red with hazardous wastes, the very high temperatures, strongly oxidizing condi-
tions, and relatively long residence times are ideal for destroying organic wastes. Furthermore, the 
basic solids in the charge that is fi  red to make cement act to sequester acid gases, such as HCl gener-
ated in the combustion of organohalide compounds. Collection of solids from the cement kiln fl  ue 
prevents release of potential pollutant ash materials.
21.8 BIODEGRADATION OF WASTES
Biodegradation  of wastes is a term that describes the conversion of wastes by enzymatic biological 
processes to simple inorganic molecules (mineralization) and, to a certain extent, to biological 
materials. Usually, the products of biodegradation are molecular forms that tend to occur in nature 
and that are in greater thermodynamic equilibrium with their surroundings than are the starting 
materials. Detoxifi  cation  refers to the biological conversion of a toxic substance to a less toxic spe-
cies. Microbial bacteria and fungi possessing enzyme systems required for biodegradation of wastes 
are usually best obtained from populations of indigenous microorganisms at a hazardous waste site 
where they have developed the ability to degrade particular kinds of molecules. Biological treatment 
offers a number of signifi  cant advantages and has considerable potential for the degradation of haz-
ardous wastes, even in situ .
Under the label of bioremediation , the use of microbial processes to destroy hazardous wastes 
has been the subject of intense investigation for many years.4 Doubts still exist about claims for its 
effectiveness in a number of applications. It must be kept in mind, however, that there are many fac-
tors that can cause biodegradation to fail as a treatment process. Often physical conditions are such 
that mixing of wastes, nutrients, and electron acceptor species (such as oxygen) is too slow to permit 
biodegradation to occur at a useful rate. Low temperatures may make reactions too slow to be use-
ful. Toxicants, such as heavy metals, may inhibit biological activity, and some metabolites produced 
by the microorganisms may be toxic to them.
21.8.1 B IODEGRADABILITY
The biodegradability  of a compound is infl  uenced by its physical characteristics, such as solubility 
in water and vapor pressure, and by its chemical properties, including molar mass, molecular struc-
ture, and presence of various kinds of functional groups, some of which provide a “biochemical 
handle” for the initiation of biodegradation. With the appropriate organisms and under the right 
conditions, even substances such as phenol that are considered to be biocidal to most microorgan-
isms can undergo biodegradation.
Recalcitrant  or biorefractory  substances are those that resist biodegradation and tend to per-
sist and accumulate in the environment. Such materials are not necessarily toxic to organisms, 
but simply resist their metabolic attack. However, even some compounds regarded as biorefrac-
tory may be degraded by microorganisms that have had the opportunity to adapt to their biodeg-
radation; for example, DDT is degraded by properly acclimated Pseudomonas . Chemical 
pretreatment, especially by partial oxidation, can make some kinds of recalcitrant wastes much 
more biodegradable.
Properties of hazardous wastes and their media can be changed to increase biodegradability. 
This can be accomplished by adjustment of conditions to optimum temperature, pH (usually in 
the range of 6–9), stirring, oxygen level, and material load and by addition of nutrients. 
Biodegradation can be aided by removal of toxic organic and inorganic substances, such as heavy 
metal ions.Industrial Ecology for Waste Minimization, Utilization, and Treatment 595
21.8.2 A EROBIC  TREATMENT
Aerobic waste treatment  processes utilize aerobic bacteria and fungi that require molecular oxygen, 
O2. These processes are often favored by microorganisms, in part, because of the high energy yield 
obtained when molecular oxygen reacts with organic matter. Aerobic waste treatment is well adapted 
to the use of an activated sludge process. It can be applied to hazardous wastes such as chemical 
process wastes and landfi  ll leachates. Some systems use powdered activated carbon as an additive 
to absorb organic wastes that are not biodegraded by microorganisms in the system.
Contaminated soils can be mixed with water and treated in a bioreactor to eliminate biodegrad-
able contaminants in the soil. It is possible, in principle, to treat contaminated soils biologically in 
place by pumping oxygenated, nutrient-enriched water through the soil in a recirculating system.
21.8.3 A NAEROBIC  TREATMENT
Anaerobic waste treatment  in which microorganisms degrade wastes in the absence of oxygen can 
be practiced on a variety of organic hazardous wastes. Compared to the aerated activated sludge 
process, anaerobic digestion requires less energy; yields less sludge by-product; generates hydrogen 
sulfi de (H2S), which precipitates toxic heavy metal ions; and produces methane gas, CH4, which can 
be used as an energy source.
The overall process for anaerobic digestion is a fermentation process in which organic matter is 
both oxidized and reduced. The simplifi  ed reaction for the anaerobic fermentation of a hypothetical 
organic substance, “{CH2O},” is the following:
 2{CH2O} Æ CO2 + CH4 (21.28)
In practice, the microbial processes involved are quite complex. Most of the wastes for which anaerobic 
digestion is suitable consist of oxygenated compounds, such as acetaldehyde or methylethyl ketone.
21.8.4 R EDUCTIVE  DEHALOGENATION
Reductive dehalogenation  is a mechanism by which halogen atoms are removed from organohalide 
compounds by anaerobic bacteria. It is an important means of detoxifying alkyl halides (particu-
larly solvents), aryl halides, and organochlorine pesticides, all of which are important hazardous 
waste compounds, and which were discarded in large quantities in some of the older waste disposal 
dumps. Reductive dehalogenation is the main means by which some of the more highly halogenated 
waste compounds are biodegraded; such compounds include tetrachloroethene, HCB, pentachloro-
phenol, and the more highly chlorinated PCB congeners (see dehalorespiration in Section 6.13).
The two general processes by which reductive dehalogenation occurs are hydrogenolysis , as 
shown by the example in Reaction 21.29,
 Cl 2H 
HCl  (21.29)
and vicinal reduction :
 H
H C C C C C C Cl 
2Cl– 2e–
HHHH HH
H HHClH (21.30)596 Environmental Chemistry
Vicinal reduction removes two adjacent halogen atoms and works only on alkyl halides, not aryl 
halides. Both processes produce innocuous inorganic halide (Cl-).
21.9 PHYTOREMEDIATION
Phytoremediation  uses various kinds of plants including trees to treat soil and water contami-
nated with organic contaminants, heavy metals, and radionuclides. Although phytoremediation is 
generally regarded as using plants to remove pollutants from soil, it also includes growing plants 
on contaminated soil, often under conditions that are not normally conducive to plant growth. 
A cover of plants—phytostabilization—signifi  cantly reduces loss of pollutants from water or wind 
erosion and provides a soil medium conducive to pollutant biodegradation. Enhanced biodegrada-
tion of pollutants by microorganisms in the rhizosphere, where plant roots grow, is discussed in 
Section 16.10.
One way in which plants act to decontaminate soil is by absorbing contaminants through their 
roots and transporting them to the rest of the plant. The plant biomass may then be burned or other-
wise processed to remove the pollutants; use of plants to “mine” valuable metals, such as nickel, has

xylene, and MTBE have an undesirable tendency to release these materials to the atmosphere.
Fast-growing, deep-rooted tree varieties are favorites for phytoremediation. Willows and pop-
lars, including hybrid varieties that grow with spectacular rapidity, have been favored. Domestic 
crops including alfalfa, clover, corn, rye, sorghum, and soy have been used on soil contaminated 
with petroleum hydrocarbons. Tobacco plants bred for phytoremediation have been used on soils 
contaminated with cadmium, copper, and zinc.
21.10 LAND TREATMENT AND COMPOSTING
21.10.1 L AND TREATMENT
Soil may be viewed as a natural fi  lter for wastes. Soil has physical, chemical, and biological charac-
teristics that can enable waste detoxifi  cation, biodegradation, chemical decomposition, and physical 
and chemical fi  xation. Therefore, land treatment  of wastes may be accomplished by mixing the 
wastes with soil under appropriate conditions. In many cases, the reclamation of contaminated soil 
to restore it to productivity is an important activity.
Soil is a natural medium for a number of living organisms that may have an effect upon biodeg-
radation of hazardous wastes. Of these, the most important are bacteria, including those from the 
genera Agrobacterium , Arthrobacteri , Bacillus , Flavobacterium , and Pseudomonas. Actinomycetes  
and fungi are important organisms in decay of vegetable matter and may be involved in biodegrada-
tion of wastes.
Microorganisms useful for land treatment are usually present in suffi  cient numbers to provide the 
inoculum required for their growth. The growth of these indigenous microorganisms may be stimu-
lated by adding nutrients and an electron acceptor to act as an oxidant (for aerobic degradation) 
accompanied by mixing. The most commonly added nutrients are nitrogen and phosphorus. Oxygen 
can be added by pumping air underground or by treatment with hydrogen peroxide, H2O2. In some 
cases, such as for treatment of hydrocarbons on or near the soil surface, simple tillage provides both 
oxygen and the mixing required for optimum microbial growth. 
Wastes that are amenable to land treatment are biodegradable organic substances. However, in 
soil contaminated with hazardous wastes, bacterial cultures may develop that are effective in 
degrading normally recalcitrant compounds through acclimation over a long period of time. Land Industrial Ecology for Waste Minimization, Utilization, and Treatment 597
treatment is most used for petroleum refi  ning wastes and is applicable to the treatment of fuels and 
wastes from leaking underground storage tanks. It can also be applied to biodegradable organic 
chemical wastes, including some organohalide compounds. Land treatment is not suitable for the 
treatment of wastes containing acids, bases, toxic inorganic compounds, salts, heavy metals, and 
organic compounds that are excessively soluble, volatile, or fl  ammable.
21.10.2 C OMPOSTING
Composting  of hazardous wastes is the biodegradation of solid or solidifi  ed materials in a medium 
other than soil. Bulking material, such as plant residue, paper, municipal refuse, or sawdust may be 
added to retain water and enable air to penetrate to the waste material. Successful composting of 
hazardous waste depends upon a number of factors, including those discussed above under land 
treatment. The fi  rst of these is the selection of the appropriate microorganism or inoculum . Once 
a successful composting operation is underway, a good inoculum is maintained by recirculating 
spent compost to each new batch. Other parameters that must be controlled include oxygen supply, 
moisture content (which should be maintained at a minimum of about 40%), pH (usually around 
neutral), and temperature. The composting process generates heat, so if the mass of the compost pile 
is suffi  ciently high, it can be self-heating under most conditions. Some wastes are defi  cient in nutri-
ents, such as nitrogen, which must be supplied from commercial sources or from other wastes.
21.11 PREPARATION OF WASTES FOR DISPOSAL
Immobilization, stabilization, fi  xation, and solidifi  cation are terms that describe sometimes over-
lapping techniques whereby hazardous wastes are placed in a form suitable for long-term disposal. 
These aspects of hazardous waste management are addressed below.
21.11.1 I MMOBILIZATION
Immobilization  includes physical and chemical processes that reduce surface areas of wastes to 
minimize leaching. It isolates the wastes from their environment, especially groundwater, so that 
they have the least possible tendency to migrate. This is accomplished by physically isolating the 
waste, reducing its solubility, and decreasing its surface area. Immobilization usually improves the 
handling and physical characteristics of wastes.
21.11.2 S TABILIZATION
Stabilization  means the conversion of a waste from its original form to a physically and chemically 
more stable material that is less likely to cause problems during handling and disposal, and less 
likely to be mobile after disposal. Stabilization may include solidifi  cation (see below) and chemical 
reactions that generate products that are less volatile, soluble, and reactive. Stabilization is required 
for land disposal of wastes. Fixation  is a stabilization process that binds a hazardous waste in a less 
mobile and less toxic form.
21.11.3 S OLIDIFICATION
Solidifi  cation  may involve chemical reaction with a solidifi  cation agent, mechanical isolation in a 
protective binding matrix, or a combination of chemical and physical processes. It can be accom-
plished by evaporation of water from aqueous wastes or sludges, sorption onto solid mate-
rial,  reaction with cement, reaction with silicates, encapsulation, or imbedding in polymers or 
thermoplastics.598 Environmental Chemistry
In many solidifi  cation processes, such as reaction with portland cement, water is an important 
ingredient of the hydrated solid matrix. Therefore, the solid should not be heated excessively or 
exposed to extremely dry conditions, which could result in diminished structural integrity from loss 
of water. In some cases, however, heating a solidifi  ed waste is an essential part of the overall solidi-
fi cation procedure. For example, an iron hydroxide matrix can be converted to highly insoluble, 
refractory iron oxide by heating. Heating can convert organic constituents of solidifi  ed wastes to 
inert carbon. Heating is an integral part of the process of vitrifi  cation (see below).
21.11.3.1 Sorption to a Solid Matrix Material
Hazardous waste liquids, emulsions, sludges, and free liquids in contact with sludges may be solid-
ifi ed and stabilized by fi  xing onto solid sorbents , including activated carbon (for organics), fl  y ash, 
kiln dust, clays, vermiculite, and various proprietary materials. Sorption may convert liquids and 
semisolids to dry solids, improve waste handling, and reduce solubility of waste constituents, and 
c an  be  used  to  im pro v e  w as te  co m p a ti b ili ty  wi th  s u b s tan ces  s u c h  as  po rtl an d  ce m e n t  used  f o r  
solidifi  cation and setting. Specifi  c sorbents may also be used to stabilize pH and p E (a measure of 
the tendency of a medium to be oxidizing or reducing, see Chapter 4).
The action of sorbents can include simple mechanical retention of wastes, physical sorption, and 
chemical reactions. It is important to match the sorbent to the waste. A substance with a strong 
affi nity for water should be employed for wastes containing excess water and one with a strong 
affi nity for organic materials should be used for wastes with excess organic solvents.
21.11.3.2 Thermoplastics and Organic Polymers
Hazardous waste materials may be mixed with hot thermoplastic  liquids and solidifi  ed in the cooled 
thermoplastic matrix, which is rigid but deformable. The thermoplastic material most used for this 
purpose is asphalt bitumen. Other thermoplastics, such as paraffi  n and polyethylene, have also been 
used to immobilize hazardous wastes.
Among the wastes that can be immobilized with thermoplastics are those containing heavy met-
als, such as electroplating wastes. Organic thermoplastics repel water and reduce the tendency 
toward leaching in contact with groundwater. Compared to cement, thermoplastics add relatively 
less material to the waste.
A technique similar to that described above uses organic polymers  produced in contact wi th 
solid wastes to imbed the wastes in a polymer matrix. Three kinds of polymers that have been used 
for this purpose include polybutadiene, urea-formaldehyde, and vinyl ester-styrene polymers. This 
procedure is more complicated than is the use of thermoplastics but, in favorable cases, yields a 
product in which the waste is held more strongly.
21.11.3.3 Vitriﬁ  cation
Vitrifi  cation  or glassifi  cation  consists of imbedding wastes in a glass material. In this application, 
glass may be regarded as a high-melting-temperature inorganic thermoplastic. Molten glass can be 
used or glass can be synthesized in contact with the waste by mixing and heating with glass constit-
uents—silicon dioxide (SiO2), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), and calcium oxide (CaO). Other con-
stituents may include boron oxide, B2O3, which yields a borosilicate glass that is especially resistant 
to changes in temperature and chemical attack. In some cases, glass is used in conjunction with 
thermal waste destruction processes, serving to immobilize hazardous waste ash constituents. Some 
wastes are detrimental to the quality of the glass. Aluminum oxide, for example, may prevent glass 
from fusing.
Vitrifi  cation is relatively complicated and expensive, the latter because of the energy consumed 
in fusing glass. Despite these disadvantages, it is the favored immobilization technique for some 
special wastes and has been promoted for solidifi  cation of radionuclear wastes because glass is 
chemically inert and resistant to leaching. However, high levels of radioactivity can cause deteriora-
tion of glass and lower its resistance to leaching.Industrial Ecology for Waste Minimization, Utilization, and Treatment 599
21.11.3.4 Solidiﬁ  cation with Cement
Portland cement is widely used for solidifi  cation of hazardous wastes including wastes containing 
both metals and organic contaminants. In this application, portland cement provides a solid matrix 
for isolation of the wastes, chemically binds water from sludge wastes, and may react chemically 
with wastes (e.g., the calcium and base in portland cement react chemically with inorganic arsenic 
wastes to reduce their solubilities). However, most wastes are held physically in the rigid portland 
cement matrix and are subject to leaching.
As a solidifi  cation matrix, portland cement is most applicable to inorganic sludges containing 
heavy metal ions that form insoluble hydroxides and carbonates in the basic carbonate medium 
provided by the cement. The success of solidifi  cation with portland cement strongly depends upon 
whether or not the waste adversely affects the strength and stability of the concrete product. A 
 number of substances—organic matter such as petroleum or coal; some silts and clays; sodium salts 
of arsenate, borate, phosphate, iodate, and sulfi  de; and salts of copper, lead, magnesium, tin, and 
zinc—are incompatible with portland cement because they interfere with its set and cure, producing 
a mechanically weak product and resulting in deterioration of the cement matrix with time. However, 
a reasonably good disposal form can be obtained by absorbing organic wastes with a solid material, 
which in turn is set in portland cement.
21.11.3.5 Solidiﬁ  cation with Silicate Materials
Water-insoluble silicates  (pozzolanic substances), containing oxyanionic silicon such as SiO32-, are 
used for waste solidifi  cation. There are a number of such substances, some of which are waste prod-
ucts, including fl  y ash, fl  ue dust, clay, calcium silicates, and ground-up slag from blast furnaces. 
Soluble silicates, such as sodium silicate, may also be used. Silicate solidifi  cation usually requires a 
setting agent, which may be portland cement (see above), gypsum (hydrated CaSO4), lime, or com-
pounds of aluminum, magnesium, or iron. The product may vary from a granular material to a 
concrete-like solid. In some cases, the product is improved by additives, such as emulsifi  ers, surfac-
tants, activators, calcium chloride, clays, carbon, zeolites, and various proprietary materials. 
Success has been reported for the solidifi  cation of both inorganic wastes and organic wastes 
(including oily sludges) with silicates. The advantages and disadvantages of silicate solidifi  cation 
are similar to those of portland cement discussed above. One consideration that is especially appli-
cable to fl  y ash is the presence in some silicate materials of leachable hazardous substances, which 
may include arsenic and selenium.
21.11.3.6 Encapsulation
As the name implies, encapsulation  is used to coat wastes with an impervious material so that they 
do not come in contact with their surroundings. For example, a water-soluble waste salt encapsu-
lated in asphalt would not dissolve so long as the asphalt layer remains intact. A common means of 
encapsulation uses heated, molten thermoplastics, asphalt, and waxes that solidify when cooled. 
A more sophisticated approach to encapsulation is to form polymeric resins from monomeric 
 substances in the presence of the waste.
21.11.4 C HEMICAL  FIXATION
Chemical fi  xation  is a process that binds a hazardous waste substance in a less mobile, less toxic 
form by a chemical reaction that alters the waste chemically. Physical and chemical fi  xations often 
occur together, and sometimes it is a little diffi  cult to distinguish between them. Polymeric in organic 
silicates containing some calcium and often some aluminum are the inorganic materials most widely 
used as a fi  xation matrix. Many kinds of heavy metals are chemically bound in such a matrix, as 
well as being held physically by it. Similarly, some organic wastes are bound by reactions with 
matrix constituents.600 Environmental Chemistry
21.12 ULTIMATE DISPOSAL OF WASTES
Regardless of the destruction, treatment, and immobilization techniques used, there will always 
remain, from hazardous wastes, some material that has to be put somewhere. This section briefl  y 
addresses the ultimate disposal of ash, salts, liquids, solidifi  ed liquids, and other residues that must 
be placed where their potential to do harm is minimized.
21.12.1 D ISPOSAL  ABOVEGROUND
In some important respects, disposal aboveground, essentially in a pile designed to prevent erosion 
and water infi  ltration, is the best way to store solid wastes. Perhaps its most important advantage is 
that it avoids infi  ltration by groundwater that can result in leaching and groundwater contamination 
common to storage in pits and landfi  lls. In a properly designed aboveground disposal facility, any 
leachate that is produced drains quickly by gravity to the leachate collection system where it can be 
detected and treated. 
Aboveground disposal can be accomplished with a storage mound deposited on a layer of com-
pacted clay covered with impermeable membrane liners laid somewhat above the original soil sur-
face and shaped to allow leachate fl  ow and collection. The slopes around the edges of the storage 
mound should be suffi  ciently great to allow good drainage of precipitation, but gentle enough to 
deter erosion.
21.12.2 L ANDFILL  
Landfi  ll  historically has been the most common way of disposing of solid hazardous wastes and 
some liquids, although it is being severely limited in many nations by new regulations and high land 
costs. Landfi  ll involves disposal that is at least partially underground in excavated cells, quarries, or 
natural depressions. Usually, fi  ll is continued above ground to utilize space most effi  ciently and 
provide a grade for drainage of precipitation.
The greatest environmental concern with landfi  l l  o f  h a z a r d o u s  w a s t e s  i s  t h e  g e n e r a t i o n  o f  
leachate from infi  ltrating surface water and groundwater with resultant contamination of ground-
water supplies. Modern hazardous waste landfi  lls provide elaborate systems to contain, collect, and 
control such leachate. 
There are several components in a modern landfi  ll. A landfi  ll shoul d be p laced on a com-
pacted, low-permeability medium, preferably clay, which is covered by a fl  exible-membrane liner 
consisting of watertight impermeable material. This liner is covered with granular material in 
which is installed a secondary drainage system. Next is another fl  exible-membrane liner, above 
which is installed a primary drainage system for the removal of leachate. This drainage system is 
covered with a layer of granular fi  lter medium, upon which the wastes are placed. In the landfi  ll, 
wastes of different kinds are separated by berms consisting of clay or soil covered with liner 
material. When the fi  ll is complete, the waste is capped to prevent surface water infi  ltration and 
covered with compacted soil. In addition to leachate collection, provision may be made for a sys-
tem to treat evolved gases, particularly when methane-generating biodegradable materials are 
disposed in the landfi  ll.
The fl  exible-membrane liner made of rubber (including chlorosulfonated polyethylene) or 
plastic (including chlorinated polyethylene, high-density polyethylene, and PVC) is a key compo-
nent of state-of-the-art landfi  lls. It controls seepage out of, and infi  ltration into, the landfi  ll. 
Obviously, liners have to meet stringent standards to serve their intended purpose. In addition to 
being impermeable, the liner material must be strongly resistant to biodegradation, chemical 
attack, and tearing.
Capping  is done to cover the wastes, prevent infi  ltration of excessive amounts of surface water, 
and prevent release of wastes to overlying soil and the atmosphere. Caps come in a variety of forms Industrial Ecology for Waste Minimization, Utilization, and Treatment 601
and are often multilayered. Some of the problems that may occur with caps are settling, erosion, 
ponding, damage by rodents, and penetration by plant roots.
21.12.3 S URFACE  IMPOUNDMENT  OF LIQUIDS  
Many liquid hazardous wastes, slurries, and sludges are placed in surface impoundments , which 
usually serve for treatment and often are designed to be fi  lled in eventually as landfi  ll disposal sites. 
Most liquid hazardous wastes and a signifi  cant fraction of solids are placed in surface impound-
ments in some stage of treatment, storage, or disposal.
A surface impoundment may consist of an excavated “pit,” a structure formed with dikes, or a 
combination thereof. The construction is similar to that discussed above for landfi  lls in that the bot-
tom and walls should be impermeable to liquids and provision must be made for leachate collection. 
The chemical and mechanical challenges to liner materials in surface impoundments are severe so 
that proper geological siting and construction with fl  oors and walls composed of low-permeability 
soil and clay are important in preventing pollution from these installations.
21.12.4 D EEP-WELL DISPOSAL  OF LIQUIDS
Deep-well disposal  of liquids consists of their injection under pressure to underground strata iso-
lated by impermeable rock strata from aquifers. Early experience with this method was gained in 
the petroleum industry where disposal is required for large quantities of saline wastewater copro-
duced with crude oil. The method was later extended to the chemical industry for the disposal of 
brines, acids, heavy metal solutions, organic liquids, and other liquids.
A number of factors must be considered in deep-well disposal. Wastes are injected into a region 
of elevated temperature and pressure, which may cause chemical reactions to occur involving the 
waste constituents and the mineral strata. Oils, solids, and gases in the liquid wastes can cause 
problems such as clogging. Corrosion may be severe. Microorganisms may have some effects. Most 
problems from these causes can be mitigated by proper waste pretreatment.
The most serious consideration involving deep-well disposal is the potential contamination of 
gr o un d w a t e r .  Al th o u g h  in j ec ti o n  i s  m a d e  in t o  pe rm e a b l e  s al tw a t e r  aq uif e r s  p r e s um a b l y  i s o l a t ed  
from aquifers that contain potable water, contamination may occur. Major routes of contamination 
include fractures, faults, and other wells. The disposal well itself can act as a route for contamina-
tion if it is not properly constructed and cased (lined with pipe) or if it is damaged.
21.13 LEACHATE AND GAS EMISSIONS
21.13.1 L EACHATE
The production of contaminated leachate is a possibility with most disposal sites.5 Therefore, new 
hazardous waste landfi  lls require leachate collection/treatment systems as discussed in Section 21.12 
and many older sites are required to have such systems retrofi  tted to them.
Chemical and biochemical processes have the potential to cause some problems for leachate col-
lection systems. One such problem is clogging by insoluble manganese(IV) and iron(III) hydrated 
oxides upon exposure to air as described for water wells in Section 15.8.
Leachate consists of water that has become contaminated by wastes as it passes through a waste 
disposal site. It contains waste constituents that are soluble, not retained by soil, and not degraded 
chemically or biochemically. Some potentially harmful leachate constituents are products of chemi-
cal or biochemical transformations of wastes.
The best approach to leachate management is to prevent its production by limiting infi  ltration of 
water into the site. Rates of leachate production may be very low when sites are selected, designed, 
and constructed with minimal production of leachate as a major objective. A well maintained, low-
permeability cap over the landfi  ll is very important for leachate minimization.602 Environmental Chemistry
21.13.2 H AZARDOUS  WASTE LEACHATE  TREATMENT
The fi  rst step in treating leachate is to characterize it fully, particularly with a thorough chemical 
analysis of possible waste constituents and their chemical and metabolic products. The biodegrad-
ability of leachate constituents should also be determined. The options available for the treatment of 
hazardous waste leachate are generally the physical, chemical, and biochemical processes used to 
treat industrial wastewaters as discussed earlier in this chapter and in Chapter 8.
21.13.3 G AS EMISSIONS  
In the presence of biodegradable wastes, methane and carbon dioxide gases are produced in  landfi  lls 
by anaerobic degradation (see Reaction 21.28). Gases may also be produced by chemical processes 
with improperly pretreated wastes, as would occur in the hydrolysis of calcium carbide to produce 
acetylene:
 CaC2 + 2H2O Æ C2H2 + Ca(OH)2 (21.31)
Odorous and toxic hydrogen sulfi  de, H2S, may be generated by the chemical reaction of sulfi  des 
with acids or by the biochemical reduction of sulfate by anaerobic bacteria ( Desulfovibrio ) in the 
presence of biodegradable organic matter:
 Anaerobic 2
bacteria 42 2 2 2SO 2{CH O} 2H  H S 2CO 2H O-++ + ææææ Æ+ +  (21.32)
Gases such as these may be toxic, combustible, or explosive. Furthermore, gases permeating 
through landfi  lled hazardous waste may carry along waste vapors, such as those of volatile aryl 
compounds and low-molar-mass halogenated hydrocarbons. Of these, the ones of most concern 
are benzene, 1,2-dibromoethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, dichlo-
romethane, tetrachloroethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, and vinyl chloride. Because 
of the hazards from these and other volatile species, it is important to minimize production of gases 
and, if signifi  cant amounts of gases are produced, they should be vented or treated by activated 
carbon sorption or fl  aring.
21.14 IN SITU  TREATMENT 
In situ treatment refers to waste treatment processes that can be applied to wastes in a disposal site 
by direct application of treatment processes and reagents to the wastes. Where possible, in situ  treat-
ment is desirable for waste site remediation.
21.14.1 IN SITU IMMOBILIZATION
In situ  immobilization is used to convert wastes to insoluble forms that will not leach from the dis-
posal site. Heavy metal contaminants including lead, cadmium, zinc, and mercury can be immobi-
lized by chemical precipitation as the sulfi  des by treatment with gaseous H2S or alkaline Na2S 
solution. Disadvantages include the high toxicity of H2S and the contamination potential of soluble 
sulfi de. Although precipitated metal sulfi  des should remain as solids in the anaerobic conditions of 
a landfi  ll, unintentional exposure to air can result in oxidation of the sulfi  de and remobilization of 
the metals as soluble sulfate salts.
Oxidation and reduction reactions can be used to immobilize heavy metals in situ . Oxidation of 
soluble Fe2+ and Mn2+ to their insoluble hydrous oxides, Fe2O3 . xH2O and MnO2 . xH2O, respec-
tively, can precipitate these metal ions and coprecipitate other heavy metal ions. However,  subsurface Industrial Ecology for Waste Minimization, Utilization, and Treatment 603
reducing conditions could later result in reformation of soluble reduced species. Reduction can be 
used in situ  to convert soluble, toxic chromate to insoluble chromium(III) compounds.
Chelation may convert metal ions to less mobile forms, although with most agents chelation has 
the opposite effect. The humin fraction of soil humic substances immobilizes metal ions.
21.14.2 V APOR EXTRACTION
Many important wastes have relatively high vapor pressures and can be removed by vapor extraction. 
This technique works for wastes in soil above the level of groundwater, that is, in the vadose zone. 
Simple in concept, vapor extraction involves pumping air into injection wells in soil and withdrawing 
it, along with volatile components that it has picked up, through extraction wells. The substances 
vaporized from the soil are removed by activated carbon or by other means. In some cases, the air is 
pumped through an engine (which can be used to run the air pumps) and organic vapors are destroyed 
by conditions in the engine’s combustion chambers. Pumping air is relatively effi  cient compared to 
groundwater pumping because of the much higher fl  ow rates of air through soil compared to water. 
Vapor extraction is most applicable to the removal of VOCs such as chloromethanes, chloroethanes, 
chloroethylenes (such as trichloroethylene), benzene, toluene, and xylene.
21.14.3 S OLIDIFICATION  IN SITU
In situ  solidifi  cation can be used as a remedial measure at hazardous waste sites. One approach is to 
inject soluble silicates followed by reagents that cause them to solidify. For example, injection of 
soluble sodium silicate followed by calcium chloride or lime forms solid calcium silicate.
21.14.4 D ETOXIFICATION  IN SITU
When only one or a limited number of harmful constituents is present in a waste disposal site, it may 
be practical to consider detoxifi  cation in situ . This approach is most practical for organic contami-
nants including pesticides (organophosphate esters and carbamates), amides, and esters. Among the 
chemical and biochemical processes that can detoxify such materials are chemical and enzymatic 
oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis. Chemical oxidants that have been proposed for this purpose 
include hydrogen peroxide, ozone, and hypochlorite. 
Enzyme extracts collected from microbial cultures and purifi  ed have been considered for in situ  
detoxifi  cation. One cell-free enzyme that has been used for detoxifi  cation of organophosphate insec-
ticides is parathion hydrolase. The hostile environment of a chemical waste landfi  ll, including the 
presence of enzyme-inhibiting heavy metal ions, is detrimental to many biochemical approaches to 
in situ  treatment. Furthermore, most sites contain a mixture of hazardous constituents, which might 
require several different enzymes for their detoxifi  cation.
21.14.5 P ERMEABLE  BED TREATMENT  
Some groundwater plumes contaminated by dissolved wastes can be treated by subsurface perme-
able reactive barriers  consisting of a permeable bed of material placed in a trench through which the 
groundwater must fl  ow. Limestone in a permeable bed neutralizes acid and precipitates some heavy 
metal hydroxides or carbonates. Synthetic ion-exchange resins can be used in a permeable bed to 
retain heavy metals and even some anionic species, although competition with ionic species present 
naturally in the groundwater can cause some problems with their use. Activated carbon in a perme-
able bed will remove some organics, especially less soluble, higher-molar-mass organic compounds.
Granular zerovalent iron  [iron(0)] offers some advantages as a permeable bed medium.6 This 
material acts as a reducing agent and can dechlorinate organochlorine compounds, which are resis-
t a n t  t o  b i o d e g r a d a t i o n .  I n  a d d i t i o n  t o  t r e a t i n g  g r o u n d w a t e r s  c o n t a m i n a t e d  w i t h  o r g a n o c h l o r i n e  604 Environmental Chemistry
compounds, permeable barriers containing zerovalent iron have been used to treat groundwaters 
polluted with inorganics, metals, munition wastes, radionuclides, and various other pollutants.
Permeable bed treatment requires relatively large quantities of reagent, which argues against the 
use of activated carbon and ion-exchange resins. In such an application, it is unlikely that either of 
these materials could be reclaimed and regenerated as is done when they are used in columns to 
treat wastewater. Furthermore, ions taken up by ion exchangers and organic species retained by 
activated carbon may be released at a later time, causing subsequent problems. Finally, a permeable 
bed that has been truly effective in collecting waste materials may, itself, be considered a hazardous 
waste requiring special treatment and disposal.
21.14.6 IN SITU THERMAL  PROCESSES
Heating of wastes in situ  can be used to remove or destroy some kinds of hazardous substances. 
Steam injection, radio frequency, and microwave heating have been proposed for this purpose. 
Volatile wastes brought to the surface by heating can be collected and held as condensed liquids or 
by activated carbon. 
One approach to immobilizing wastes in situ  is high temperature vitrifi  cation using electrical 
heating. This process involves pouring conducting graphite on the surface between two electrodes 
and passing an electric current between the electrodes. In principle, the graphite becomes very hot 
and “melts” into the soil leaving a glassy slag in its path. Volatile species evolved are collected and, 
if the operation is successful, a nonleachable slag is left in place. It is easy to imagine problems that 
might occur, including diffi  culties in getting a uniform melt, problems from groundwater infi  ltra-
tion, and very high consumption of electricity.
21.14.7 S OIL WASHING  AND FLUSHING  
Extraction with water containing various additives can be used to cleanse soil contaminated with 
hazardous wastes. When the soil is left in place and the water pumped into and out of it, the process 
is called fl u s h i n g ; when soil is removed and contacted with liquid the process is referred to as 
 washing . Here, washing is used as a term applied to both processes. 
The composition of the fl  uid used for soil washing depends upon the contaminants to be removed. 
The washing medium may consist of pure water or it may contain acids (to leach out metals or neu-
tralize alkaline soil contaminants), bases (to neutralize contaminant acids), chelating agents (to 
solubilize heavy metals), surfactants (to enhance the removal of organic contaminants from soil and 
improve the ability of the water to emulsify insoluble organic species), or reducing agents (to reduce 
oxidized species). Soil contaminants may dissolve, form emulsions, or react chemically. Heavy 
metal salts; lighter aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene and xylenes; lighter organohalides, such 
as trichloro- or tetrachloroethylene; and light-to-medium molar mass aldehydes and ketones can be 
removed from soil by washing.

22.1 BIOCHEMISTRY
The effects of pollutants and potentially harmful chemicals on living organisms are of particular 
importance in environmental chemistry. These effects are addressed under the topic of “Toxicologi-
cal Chemistry” in Chapter 23, and for specifi  c substances in Chapter 24. This chapter is designed 
to  provide the fundamental background in biochemistry required to understand toxicological 
chemistry.
Most people have had the experience of looking through a microscope at a single cell. It may 
have been an ameba, alive and oozing about like a blob of jelly on the microscope slide, or a cell of 
bacteria, stained with a dye to make it show up more plainly. Or, it may have been a beautiful cell 
of algae with its bright green chlorophyll. Even the simplest of these cells is capable of carrying out 
a thousand or more chemical reactions. These life processes fall under the heading of biochemistry , 
that branch of chemistry that deals with the chemical properties, composition, and biologically-
mediated processes of complex substances in living systems.1
Biochemical phenomena that occur in living organisms are extremely sophisticated. In the human 
body, complex metabolic processes break down a variety of food materials to simpler chemicals, 
yielding energy and the raw materials to build body constituents such as muscle, blood, and brain 
tissue. Impressive as this may be, consider a humble microscopic cell of photosynthetic cyano-
bacteria only about a micrometer in size, which requires only a few simple inorganic chemicals and 
sunlight for its existence. This cell uses sunlight energy to convert carbon from CO2, hydrogen and 
oxygen from H2O, nitrogen from NO3-, sulfur from SO42-, and phosphorus from  inorganic phosphate 
into all the proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and other materials that it requires to exist 
and reproduce. Such a simple cell accomplishes what could not be done by humans in even a vast 
chemical factory costing billions of dollars.
Ultimately, most environmental pollutants and hazardous substances are of concern because of 
their effects upon living organisms. The study of the adverse effects of substances on life processes 
requires some basic knowledge of biochemistry. Biochemistry is discussed in this chapter, with 
emphasis upon aspects that are especially pertinent to environmentally hazardous and toxic sub-
stances, including cell membranes, DNA, and enzymes. 
Biochemical processes not only are profoundly infl  uenced by chemical species in the environ-
ment, they largely determine the nature of these species, their degradation, and even their syntheses, 
particularly in the aquatic and soil environments. The study of such phenomena forms the basis of 
environmental biochemistry .2
22.1.1 B IOMOLECULES
The biomolecules that constitute matter in living organisms often are polymers with molecular masses 
of the order of a million or even larger. As discussed later in this chapter, these biomolecules may be 
divided into the categories of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Proteins and nucleic 
acids consist of macromolecules, lipids are usually relatively small molecules, and carbohydrates 
range from small sugar molecules to high molar mass macromolecules such as those in cellulose.610 Environmental Chemistry
The behavior of a substance in a biological system depends to a large extent upon whether the 
substance is hydrophilic (“water-loving”) or hydrophobic (“water-hating”). Some important toxic 
substances are hydrophobic, a characteristic that enables them to traverse cell membranes readily. 
Part of the detoxifi  cation process carried on by living organisms is to render such molecules hydro-
philic, therefore water-soluble and readily eliminated from the body.
22.2 BIOCHEMISTRY AND THE CELL
The focal point of biochemistry and biochemical aspects of toxicants is the cell, the basic building 
block of living systems where most life processes are carried out. Bacteria, yeasts, and some algae 
consist of single cells. However, most living things are made up of many cells. In a more complicated 
organism, the cells have different functions. Liver cells, muscle cells, brain cells, and skin cells in the 
human body are quite different from each other and do different things. Cells are divided into two 
major categories depending upon whether or not they have a nucleus: eukaryotic  cells have a nucleus 
and prokaryotic  cells do not. Prokaryotic cells are found predominately in single-celled organisms 
such as bacteria. Eukaryotic cells occur in multicellular plants and animals—higher life forms.
22.2.1 M AJOR CELL FEATURES
Figure 22.1 shows the major features of the eukaryotic cell , which is the basic structure in which 
biochemical processes occur in multicellular organisms. These features are the following:
Cell membrane• , which encloses the cell and regulates the passage of ions, nutrients, lipid-
soluble (“fat-soluble”) substances, metabolic products, toxicants, and toxicant metabolites 
into and out of the cell interior because of its varying permeability  for different substances. 
The cell membrane protects the contents of the cell from undesirable outside infl  uences. 
Cell membranes are composed in part of phospholipids that are arranged with their 
 hydrophilic (“water-seeking”) heads on the cell membrane surfaces and their hydrophobic 
(“water-repelling”) tails inside the membrane. Cell membranes contain bodies of proteins 
that are involved in the transport of some substances through the membrane. One reason 
the cell membrane is very important in toxicology and environmental biochemistry is 
because it regulates the passage of toxicants and their products into and out of the cell 
interior. Furthermore, when its membrane is damaged by toxic substances, a cell may not 
function properly and the organism may be harmed.

FIGURE 22.1  Some major features of the eukaryotic cell in animals ( left) and plants ( right ).Environmental Biochemistry 611
Cell nucleus• , which acts as a sort of “control center” of the cell. It contains the genetic 
directions the cell needs to reproduce itself. The key substance in the nucleus is deoxyribo-
nucleic acid  (DNA). Chromosomes  in the cell nuc leus are made up of combinations of 
DNA and proteins. Each chromosome stores a separate quantity of genetic information. 
Human cells contain 46 chromosomes. When DNA in the nucleus is damaged by foreign 
substances, various toxic effects, including mutations, cancer, birth defects, and defective 
immune system function may occur.
Cytoplasm• , which fi  lls the interior of the cell not occupied by the nucleus. Cytoplasm is 
further divided into a water-soluble proteinaceous fi  ller called cytosol , in which are sus-
pended bodies called cellular organelles , such as mitochondria or, in photosynthetic 
organisms, chloroplasts.
Mitochondria• , “powerhouses” which mediate energy conversion and utilization in the cell. 
Mitochondria are sites in which food materials—carbohydrates, proteins, and fats—are 
broken down to yield carbon dioxide, water, and energy, which is then used by the cell. 
The best example of this is the oxidation of the sugar glucose, C6H12O6:
 C6H12O6 + 6O2 Æ 6CO2 + 6H2O + energy
 This kind of process is called cellular respiration .
Ribosomes• , which participate in protein synthesis.
Endoplasmic reticulum• , which is involved in the metabolism of some toxicants by enzy-
matic processes.
Lysosome• , a type of organelle that contains potent substances capable of digesting liquid 
food material. Such material enters the cell through a “dent” in the cell wall, which eventu-
ally becomes surrounded by cell material. This surrounded material is called a food vacu-
ole. The vacuole merges with a lysosome and the substances in the lysosome bring about 
the digestion of the food material. The digestion process consists largely of hydrolysis 
reactions  in which large, complicated food molecules are broken down into smaller units 
by the addition of water.
Golgi bodies• , that occur in some types of cells. These are fl  attened bodies of material that 
serve to hold and release substances produced by the cells.
Cell walls•  of plant cells. These are strong structures that provide stiffness and strength. 
Cell walls are composed mostly of cellulose, which will be discussed later in this chapter.
Vacuoles•  inside plant cells that often contain materials dissolved in water.
Chloroplasts•  in plant cells that are involved in photosynthesis (the chemical process which 
uses energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water to organic matter). 
Photosynthesis occurs in these bodies. Food produced by photosynthesis is stored in the 
chloroplasts in the form of starch grains .
22.3 PROTEINS
Proteins  are nitrogen-containing organic compounds which are the basic units of live systems. 
Cytoplasm, the jelly-like liquid fi  lling the interior of cells, is largely protein. Enzymes, which act as 
catalysts of life reactions, are proteins; they are discussed later in the chapter. Proteins are made up 
of amino acids  joined together in huge chains. Amino acids are organic compounds which contain 
the carboxylic acid group, -CO2H, and the amino group, -NH2. They are sort of a hybrid of car-
boxylic acids and amines. Proteins are polymers or macromolecules  of amino acids containing from 
approximately 40 to several thousand amino acid groups joined by peptide linkages. Smaller mole-
cule amino acid polymers, containing only about 10–40 amino acids per molecule, are called poly-
peptides . A portion of the amino acid left after the elimination of H2O during polymerization is 612 Environmental Chemistry
called a residue . The amino acid sequence of these residues is designated by a series of three-letter 
abbreviations for the amino acid.
Natural amino acids all have the following chemical group:
 H H 
H N 
C C R O 
OH 
In this structure, the -NH2 group is always bonded to the carbon next to the -CO2H group. This is 
called the “alpha” location, so natural amino acids are a-amino acids. Other groups, designated as 
“R,” are attached to the basic a-amino acid structure. The R groups may be as simple as an atom of 
H found in glycine,

C C C C Zwitterion
formO O 
O– OH 
or, they may be as complicated as the structure,

R group found in tryptophan N C 
found in tryptophan. There are 20 common amino acids in proteins, examples of which are shown 
in Figure 22.2. The amino acids are shown with uncharged -NH2 and -CO2H groups. Actually, 
these functional groups exist in the charged zwitterion  form as shown for glycine, above.
Amino acids in proteins are joined together by a specifi  c bond called the peptide linkage . 
The formation of peptide linkages is a condensation process involving the loss of water. 
Consider as an example the condensation of alanine, leucine, and tyrosine, as shown in 
Figure 22.3. When these three amino acids join together, two water molecules are eliminated. 
The product is a tripeptide since there are three amino acids involved. The amino acids in pro-
teins are linked as shown for this tripeptide, except that many more monomeric amino acid 
groups are involved.
Proteins may be divided into several major types that have widely varying functions. These are 
given in Table 22.1.

22.3.1  PROTEIN  STRUCTURE
The order of amino acids in protein molecules, and the resulting three-dimensional structures that 
form, provide an enormous variety of possibilities for protein structure . This is what makes life so 
diverse. Proteins have primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures. The structures of 
protein molecules determine the behavior of proteins in crucial areas such as the processes by which 
the body’s immune system recognizes substances that are foreign to the body. Proteinaceous enzy-
mes depend upon their structures for the very specifi  c functions of the enzymes.
The order of amino acids in the protein molecule determines its primary structure . Secondary 
protein structures  result from the folding of polypeptide protein chains to produce a maximum 
number of hydrogen bonds between them:

immune system
Regulatory Insulin, human growth hormone Regulate biochemical processes such as sugar metabolism or 
growth by binding to sites inside cells or on cell membranes
Enzymes Acetylcholinesterase Catalysts of biochemical reactions (see Section 22.6)614 Environmental Chemistry
The nature of the R groups on the amino acids determines the secondary structure. Small R groups 
enable protein molecules to be hydrogen-bonded together in a parallel arrangement. With larger 
R groups, the molecules tend to take a spiral form. Such a spiral is known as an a-helix.
Tertiary structures  are formed by the twisting of a-helices into specifi  c shapes. They are pro-
duced and held in place by the interactions of amino side chains on the amino acid residues consti-
tuting the protein macromolecules. Tertiary protein structure is very important in the processes by 
which enzymes identify specifi  c proteins and other molecules upon which they act. It is also involved 
with the action of antibodies in blood which recognize foreign proteins by their shape and react to 
them. This is basically what happens in the case of immunity to a disease where antibodies in blood 
recognize specifi  c proteins from viruses or bacteria and reject them.
Two or more protein molecules consisting of separate polypeptide chains may be further attracted 
to each other to produce a quaternary structure .
Some proteins are fi b r o u s  p r o t e i n s , which occur in skin, hair, wool, feathers, silk, and tendons. 
The molecules in these proteins are long and threadlike and are laid out parallel in bundles. Fibrous 
proteins are quite tough and they do not dissolve in water.
Aside from fi  brous protein, the other major type of protein form is the globular protein . These 
proteins are in the shape of balls and oblongs. Globular proteins are relatively soluble in water. 
A typical globular protein is hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells. Enzymes 
are generally globular proteins.
22.3.2 D ENATURATION  OF PROTEINS
Secondary, tertiary, and quaternary protein structures are easily changed by a process called 
 denaturation . These changes can be quite damaging. Heating, exposure to acids or bases, and even 
 violent physical action can cause denaturation to occur. The albumin protein in egg white is 
 denatured by heating so that it forms a semisolid mass. Almost the same thing is accomplished by 
the violent physical action of an egg beater in the preparation of meringue. Heavy metal poisons 
such as lead and cadmium change the structures of proteins by binding to functional groups on the 
protein surface.
22.4 CARBOHYDRATES
Carbohydrates  have the approximate simple formula CH2O and include a diverse range of sub-
stances composed of simple sugars such as glucose:
 C C C C O 
H H CH2OH 
OH H 
H 
OH H 
OH Glucose molecule 
HO C 
High-molar-mass polysaccharides , such as starch and glycogen (“animal starch”), are biopolymers 
of simple sugars.
When photosynthesis occurs in a plant cell, the energy from sunlight is converted to chemical 
energy in a carbohydrate. This carbohydrate may be transferred to some other part of the plant for 
use as an energy source. It may be converted to a water-insoluble carbohydrate for storage until it is 
needed for energy. Or it may be transformed to cell wall material and become part of the structure 
of the plant. If the plant is eaten by an animal, the carbohydrate is used for energy by the animal.
The simplest carbohydrates are the monosaccharides , also called simple sugars . Because they 
have six carbon atoms, simple sugars are sometimes called hexoses. Glucose (formula shown above) 
is the most common simple sugar involved in cell processes. Other simple sugars with the same Environmental Biochemistry 615
formula but somewhat different structures are fructose, mannose, and galactose. These must be 
changed to glucose before they can be used in a cell. Because of its use for energy in body processes, 
glucose is found in the blood. Normal levels are from 65 to 110 mg glucose per 100 mL of blood. 
Higher levels may indicate diabetes.
Units of two monosaccharides make up several very important sugars known as disaccharides . 
When two molecules of monosaccharides join together to form a disaccharide,
 C6H12O6 + C6H12O6 Æ C12H22O11 + H2O (22.1)
a molecule of water is lost. Recall that proteins are also formed from smaller amino acid molecules 
by condensation reactions involving the loss of water molecules. Disaccharides include sucrose (cane 
sugar used as a sweetener), lactose (milk sugar), and maltose (a product of the breakdown of starch).
Polysaccharides  consist of many simple sugar units hooked together. One of the most important 
polysaccharides is starch , which is produced by plants for food storage. Animals produce a related 
material called glycogen . The chemical formula of starch is (C6H10O5)n, where n may represent a 
number as high as several hundreds. What this means is that the very large starch molecule consists 
of many units of C6H10O5 joined together. For example, if n is 100, there are 6 times 100 carbon 
atoms, 10 times 100 hydrogen atoms, and 5 times 100 oxygen atoms in the molecule. Its chemical 
formula is C600H1000O500. The atoms in a starch molecule are actually present as linked rings repre-
sented by the structure shown in Figure 22.4. Starch occurs in many foods, such as bread and 
 cereals. It is readily digested by animals, including humans.
Cellulose  is a polysaccharide which is also made up of C6H10O5 units. Molecules of cellulose are 
huge, with molecular masses of around 400,000. The cellulose structure (Figure 22.5) is similar to 
that of starch. Cellulose is produced by plants and forms the structural material of plant cell walls. 
Wood is about 60% cellulose and cotton contains over 90% of this material. Fibers of cellulose are 
extracted from wood and pressed together to make paper.
Humans and most other animals cannot digest cellulose because they lack the enzyme needed to 
hydrolyze the oxygen linkages between the glucose molecules. Ruminant animals (cattle, sheep, goats, 
moose) have bacteria in their stomachs that break down cellulose into products which can be used by 
the animal. Chemical processes are available to convert cellulose to simple sugars by the reaction

where n may be 2000–3000. This involves breaking the linkages between units of C6H10O5 by add-
ing a molecule of H2O at each linkage, a hydrolysis reaction. Large amounts of cellulose from wood, 
sugarcane, and agricultural products go to waste each year. The hydrolysis of cellulose enables these 
products to be converted to sugars, which can be fed to animals. 
Carbohydrate groups are attached to protein molecules in a special class of materials called 
 glycoproteins . Collagen is a crucial glycoprotein that provides structural integrity to body parts. It 
is a major constituent of skin, bones, tendons, and cartilage.
22.5 LIPIDS
Lipids  are substances that can be extracted from plant or animal matter by organic solvents, such as 
chloroform, diethyl ether, or toluene (Figure 22.6). Whereas carbohydrates and proteins are character-
ized predominately by the monomers (monosaccharides and amino acids) from which they are com-
posed, lipids are defi  ned essentially by their physical characteristic of organophilicity. The most 
common lipids are fats and oils composed of triglycerides  formed from the alcohol glycerol, CH2(OH)
CH(OH)CH2OH, and a long-chain fatty acid such as stearic acid, CH3(CH2)16COOH, as shown in 
FIGURE 22.6 Lipids are extracted from some biological materials with a soxhlet extractor (above). The 
solvent is vaporized in the distillation fl  ask by the heating mantle, rises through one of the exterior tubes to 
the condenser, and is cooled to form a liquid. The liquid drops onto the porous thimble containing the sample. 
Siphon action periodically drains the solvent back into the distillation fl  ask. The extracted lipid collects as a 
solution in the solvent in the fl  ask.

Figure 22.7. Numerous other biological materials, including waxes, cholesterol, and some vitamins 
and hormones, are classifi  ed as lipids. Common foods such as butter and salad oils are lipids. The 
longer chain fatty acids such as stearic acid are also organic-soluble and are classifi  ed as lipids.
Lipids are toxicologically important for several reasons. Some toxic substances interfere with 
lipid metabolism, leading to detrimental accumulation of lipids. Many toxic organic compounds are 
poorly soluble in water but are lipid-soluble, so that bodies of lipids in organisms serve to dissolve 
and store toxicants.
An important class of lipids consists of phosphoglycerides  (glycerophosphatides), which may be 
regarded as triglycerides in which one of the acids bonded to glycerol is orthophosphoric acid. 
These lipids are especially important because they are essential constituents of cell membranes. 
These membranes consist of bilayers in which the hydrophilic phosphate ends of the molecules are 
on the outside of the membrane and the hydrophobic “tails” of the molecules are on the inside.
Waxes are also esters of fatty acids. However, the alcohol in a wax is not glycerol, but is often a 
very long chain alcohol. For example, one of the main compounds in beeswax is myricyl palmitate 
in which the alcohol portion of the ester has a very large hydrocarbon chain:
(C30H61) C O C (C15H31) O H 
H 
Alcohol portion 
of este r Fatty acid portion 
of este r Myricyl palmitate 
Waxes are produced by both plants and animals, largely as protective coatings. Waxes are found 
in a number of common products. Lanolin is one of these. It is the “grease” in sheep’s wool. When 
mixed with oils and water, it forms stable colloidal emulsions consisting of extremely small oil 
droplets suspended in water. This makes lanolin useful for skin creams and pharmaceutical oint-
ments. Carnauba wax occurs as a coating on the leaves of some Brazilian palm trees. Spermaceti 
wax is composed largely of cetyl palmitate (below), extracted from the blubber of the sperm whale. 
It is very useful in some cosmetics and pharmaceutical preparations.
Steroids are lipids found in living systems which all have the ring system shown in Figure 22.8 
for cholesterol. Steroids occur in bile salts, which are produced by the liver and then secreted into 
the intestines. Their breakdown products contribute to the characteristic color of feces. Bile salts act 
upon fats in the intestine. They suspend very tiny fat droplets in the form of colloidal emulsions. 
This enables the fats to be broken down chemically and digested.
Some steroids are hormones . Hormones act as “messengers” from one part of the body to another. 
As such, they start and stop a number of body functions. Male and female sex hormones (estrogens) 
are examples of steroid hormones. Hormones are given off by glands in the body called endocrine 
glands . The locations of important endocrine glands are shown in Figure 22.9.FIGURE 22.7 General formula of triglycerides, which make up fats and oils. The R group is from a fatty 
acid and is a hydrocarbon chain, such as –(CH2)16CH3.H

22.6 ENZYMES
Catalysts are substances that speed up a chemical reaction without themselves being consumed in 
the reaction. The most sophisticated catalysts of all are those found in living systems. They bring 
about reactions that could not be performed at all, or only with great diffi  culty, outside a living 
organism. These catalysts are called enzymes . In addition to speeding up reactions by as much as 
ten- to a hundred million-fold, enzymes are extremely selective in the reactions they promote. 
Enzymes are proteinaceous substances with highly specifi  c structures that interact with par-
ticular substances or classes of substances called substrates . Enzymes act as catalysts to enable 
biochemical reactions to occur, after which they are regenerated intact to take part in additional 
reactions. The extremely high specifi  city with which enzymes interact with substrates results from 
their “lock and key” action based upon the unique shapes of enzymes as illustrated in Figure 
22.10. This illustration shows that an enzyme “recognizes” a particular substrate by its molecular 
structure and binds to it to produce an enzyme–substrate complex . This complex then breaks apart 
to form one or more products different from the original substrate, regenerating the unchanged 
enzyme, which is then  available to catalyze additional reactions. The basic process for an enzyme 
reaction is, therefore,
 +- + /arrowpairrightleft/arrowpairrightleft enzyme substrate enzyme substrate complex enzyme product  (22.3)
Several important things should be noted about this reaction. As shown in Figure 22.10, an 
e nz y m e  a c t s  u p o n  a  s pec i fi  c substrate to form an enzyme–substrate complex because of the fi  t 
between their structures. As a result, something happens to the substrate molecule. For example, it 
might be split in two at a particular location. Then the enzyme–substrate complex comes apart, 
yielding the enzyme and products. The enzyme is not changed in the reaction and is now free to FIGURE 22.8  Steroids are characterized by the ring structure shown above for cholesterol.H3C H3C CH3

react again. Note that the arrows in the formula for enzyme reaction point both ways. This means 
that the reaction is reversible . An enzyme–substrate complex can simply go back to the enzyme and 
the substrate. The products of an enzymatic reaction can react with the enzyme to form the enzyme–
substrate complex again. It, in turn, may again form the enzyme and the substrate. Therefore, the 
same enzyme may act to cause a reaction to go either way.
Some enzymes cannot function by themselves. In order to work, they must fi  rst be attached to 
coenzymes . Coenzymes normally are not protein materials. Some of the vitamins are important 
coenzymes.
Enzymes are named based on what they do. For example, the enzyme given off by the stomach, 
which splits proteins as part of the digestion process, is called gastric proteinase . The “gastric” 
part of the name refers to the enzyme’ s origin in the stomach. The “proteinase” denotes that it 
splits up protein molecules. The common name for this enzyme is pepsin. Similarly, the enzyme 
produced by the pancreas that breaks down fats (lipids) is called pancreatic lipase . Its common 
name is steapsin. In general, lipase enzymes cause lipid triglycerides to dissociate and form 
 glycerol and fatty acids.
The enzymes mentioned above are hydrolyzing enzymes , which bring about the breakdown of 
high-molecular-mass biological compounds and add water. This is one of the most important 
types of the reactions involved in digestion. The three main classes of energy-yielding foods that 
animals eat are carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Recall that the higher carbohydrates humans 
eat are largely disaccharides (sucrose, or table sugar) and polysaccharides (starch). These are 
formed by the joining together of units of simple sugars, C6H12O6, with the elimination of an 
H2O molecule at the linkage where they join. Proteins are formed by the condensation of amino 
acids, again with the elimination of a water molecule at each linkage. Fats are esters that are 
produced when glycerol and fatty acids link together. A water molecule is lost for each of these 
linkages when a protein, fat, or carbohydrate is synthesized. In order for these substances to be 
used as a food source, the reverse process must occur to break down large, complicated mole-
cules of protein, fat, or carbohydrate to simple, soluble substances which can penetrate a cell 
membrane and take part in chemical processes in the cell. This reverse process is accomplished 
by hydrolyzing enzymes.FIGURE 22.10  Representation of the “lock-and-key” mode of enzyme action which enables the very high

to split off CO2 and produce a compound with one less carbon. It is by such carbon-by-carbon 
break down reactions that long chain compounds are eventually degraded to CO2 in the body, or that 
long-chain hydrocarbons undergo biodegradation by the action of microorganisms in the water and 
soil environments.
Oxidation and reduction are the major reactions for the exchange of energy in living systems. 
Cellular respiration is an oxidation reaction in which a carbohydrate, C6H12O6, is broken down to 
carbon dioxide and water with the release of energy:
 C6H12O6 + 6O2 Æ 6CO2 + 6H2O + energy (22.5)
Actually , such an overall reaction occurs in living systems by a complicated series of individual 
steps. Some of these steps involve oxidation. The enzymes that bring about oxidation in the presence 
of free O2 are called oxidases . In general, biological oxidation–reduction reactions are catalyzed by 
oxidoreductase enzymes .
In addition to the types of enzymes discussed above, there are many enzymes that perform miscel-
laneous duties in living systems. Typical of these are isomerases , which form isomers of particular 
compounds. For example, of the several simple sugars with the formula C6H12O6, only glucose can be 
used directly for cell processes. The other isomers are converted to glucose by the action of isomerases. 
Transferase enzymes  m o v e  c h e m i c a l  g r o u p s  f r o m  o n e  m o l e c u l e  t o  a n o t h e r ,  lyase enzymes  remove 
chemical groups without hydrolysis and participate in the formation of C =C bonds or addition of spe-
cies to such bonds, and ligase enzymes  work in conjunction with adenosine triphosphate (ATP), (a high-
energy molecule that plays a crucial role in energy-yielding, glucose-oxidizing metabolic processes), to 
link molecules together with the formation of bonds such as carbon–carbon or carbon–sulfur bonds.
Enzyme action may be affected by many different things. Enzymes require a certain hydrogen 
ion concentration (pH) to function best. For example, gastric proteinase requires the acid environ-
ment of the stomach to work well. When it passes into the much less acidic intestines, it stops work-
ing. This prevents damage to the intestine walls, which would occur if the enzyme tried to digest 
them. Temperature is critical. Not surprisingly, the enzymes in the human body work best at around 
37°C (98.6°F), which is the normal body temperature. Heating these enzymes to around 60°C per-
manently destroys them. Some bacteria that thrive in hot springs have enzymes that work best at 
temperatures as high as that of boiling water. Other “cold-seeking” bacteria have enzymes adapted 
to near the freezing point of water.
One of the greatest concerns regarding the effects of surroundings upon enzymes is the infl  uence 
of toxic substances. A major mechanism of toxicity is the alteration or destruction of enzymes by 
toxic agents—cyanide, heavy metals, or organic compounds such as insecticidal parathion. An 
enzyme that has been destroyed obviously cannot perform its designated function, whereas one that 
has been altered either may not function at all or may act improperly. The detrimental effects of 
toxicants on enzymes are discussed in more detail in Chapter 23.
22.7 NUCLEIC ACIDS
The structural formulas of the monomeric constituents of nucleic acids are given in Figure 22.11. 
These are pyrimidine or purine nitrogen-containing bases, two sugars, and phosphate. DNA Environmental Biochemistry 621
 molecules are made up of the nitrogen-containing bases adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine; 
phosphoric acid (H3PO4); and the simple sugar 2-deoxy- b-D-ribofuranose (commonly  called deo-
xyribose). RNA molecules are composed of the nitrogen-containing bases adenine, guanine, cyto-
sine, and uracil; phosphoric acid (H3PO4); and the simple sugar b-D-ribofuranose (ribose).
The formation of nucleic acid polymers from their monomeric constituents may be viewed as the 
following steps:
Monosaccharide (simple sugar) • + cyclic nitrogenous base yields a nucleoside .
Nucleoside • + phosphate yields phosphate ester nucleotide .

Molecules of DNA are huge with molecular masses >1 billion. Molecules of RNA are also 
quite large. The structure of DNA is that of the famed “double helix” (Figure 22.12). It was fi  g-
ured out in 1953 by an American scientist, James D. Watson, and Francis Crick, a British scien-
tist. They received the Nobel Prize for this scientifi  c milestone in 1962. This model visualizes 
DNA as a so-called double a-helix structure of oppositely wound polymeric strands held together 
by hydrogen bonds between opposing pyrimidine and purine groups. As a result, DNA has both 
a primary and a secondary structure; the former is due to the sequence of nucleotides in the indi-
vidual strands of DNA and the latter results from the a-helix interaction of the two strands. In the 
FIGURE 22.12  Representation of the double helix structure of DNA showing the allowed base pairs held

secondary structure of DNA, only cytosine can be opposite guanine and only thymine can be 
opposite adenine and vice versa. Basically, the structure of DNA is that of two spiral ribbons 
“counter-wound” around each other as illustrated in Figure 22.12.  The two strands of DNA are 
complementary . This means that a particular portion of one strand fi  ts like a key in a lock with 
the corresponding portion of another strand. If the two strands are pulled apart, each manufac-
tures a new complementary strand, so that two copies of the original double helix result. This 
occurs during cell reproduction.
The molecule of DNA is sort of a coded message. This “message,” the genetic information 
 contained in, and transmitted by nucleic acids, depends upon the sequence of bases from which 
they are composed. It is somewhat like the message sent by telegraph, which consists only of dots, 
dashes, and spaces in between. The key aspect of DNA structure that enables storage and replication 
of this information is the famed double helix structure of DNA mentioned above.
Portions of the DNA double helix may unravel, and one of the strands of DNA may produce a strand 
of RNA. This substance then goes from the cell nucleus out into the cell and regulates the synthesis of 
new protein. In this way, DNA regulates the function of the cell and acts to control life processes.
22.7.1 N UCLEIC  ACIDS IN PROTEIN  SYNTHESIS
Whenever a new cell is formed, the DNA in its nucleus must be accurately reproduced from the 
parent cell. Life processes are absolutely dependent upon accurate protein synthesis as regulated by 
cell DNA. The DNA in a single cell must be capable of directing the synthesis of up to 3000 or even 
more different proteins. The directions for the synthesis of a single protein are contained in a 
 segment of DNA called a gene. The process of transmitting information from DNA to a newly-
synthesized protein involves the following steps:
The DNA undergoes • replication.  This process involves separation of a segment of the 
double helix into separate single strands which then replicate such that guanine is opposite 
cytosine (and vice versa) and adenine is opposite thymine (and vice versa). This process 
continues until a complete copy of the DNA molecule has been produced.
The newly replicated DNA produces • messenger RNA  (m-RNA ), a complement of the single 
strand of DNA, by a process called transcription .
A new protein is synthesized using m-RNA as a template to determine the order of amino • 
acids in a process called translation .
22.7.2  MODIFIED  DNA
DNA molecules may be modifi  ed by the unintentional addition or deletion of nucleotides or by sub-
stituting one nucleotide for another. The result is a mutation  t h a t  i s  t r a n s m i t t a b l e  t o  o f f s p r i n g .  
Mutations can be induced by chemical substances. This is a major concern from a toxicological 
viewpoint because of the detrimental effects of many mutations and because substances that cause 
mutations often cause cancer as well. DNA malfunction may result in birth defects and the failure 
to control cell reproduction results in cancer. Radiation from x-rays and radioactivity also disrupts 
DNA and may cause mutation.
22.8 RECOMBINANT DNA AND GENETIC ENGINEERING
As noted above, segments of DNA contain information for the specifi  c syntheses of particular pro-
teins. Within the last two decades, it has become possible to transfer this information between 
organisms by means of recombinant DNA technology , which has resulted in a new industry based 
on genetic engineering . Most often the recipient organisms are bacteria, which can be reproduced 
(cloned) over many orders of magnitude from a cell that has acquired the desired qualities.  There fore, 624 Environmental Chemistry
to synthesize a particular substance such as human insulin or growth hormone, the required 
 genetic information can be transferred from a human source to bacterial cells, which then produce 
the substance as part of their metabolic processes.
The fi  rst step in recombinant DNA gene manipulation is to lyze or “open up” a cell that has the 
genetic material needed and to remove this material from the cell. Through enzyme action, the 
sought-after genes are cut from the donor DNA chain. These are next spliced into small DNA 
 molecules. These molecules, called cloning vehicles , are capable of penetrating the host cell and 
becoming incorporated into its genetic material. The modifi  ed host cell is then reproduced many 
times and carries out the desired biosynthesis.
Early concerns about the potential of genetic engineering to produce “monster organisms” or 
new and horrible diseases have been largely allayed, although caution is still required with this 
technology. In the environmental area, genetic engineering offers some hope for the production of 
bacteria engineered to safely destroy troublesome wastes and to produce biological substitutes for 
environmentally damaging synthetic pesticides.
Numerous possibilities exist for combining biology with chemistry to produce chemical feed-
stocks and products of various kinds. An example is the production of polylactic acid using lactic 
acid produced enzymaticall y wi th corn and pol ymerized b y standard chemical processes. M uch 
attention has been focused on the development of enzymes to perform a variety of chemical conver-
sions. Another important area that uses transgenic organisms is the breeding of plants that produce 
natural insecticides, specifi  cally the insecticide from Bacillus thuringiensis . 
22.9 METABOLIC PROCESSES
Biochemical processes that involve the alteration of biomolecules fall under the category of meta-
bolism . Metabolic processes may be divided into the two major categories of anabolism  (synthesis) 
and catabolism  (degradation of substances). An organism may use metabolic processes to yield 
energy or to modify the constituents of biomolecules.
22.9.1 E NERGY -YIELDING  PROCESSES
Organisms can gain energy by one of three major processes, which are listed as follows:
Respiration• , in which organic compounds undergo catabolism that requires molecular oxygen 
(aerobic respiration ) or that occurs in the absence of molecular oxygen ( anaerobic respira-
tion). Aerobic respiration uses the Krebs cycle  to obtain energy from the following reaction:
 C6H12O6 + 6O2 Æ 6CO2 + 6H2O + energy
 About half of the energy released is converted to short-term stored chemical energy, par-
ticularly through the synthesis of ATP nucleotide. For longer-term energy storage, glyco-
gen or starch polysaccharides are synthesized, and for still longer-term energy storage, 
lipids (fats) are generated and retained by the organism.
Fermentation• , which differs from respiration in not having an electron transport chain. 
Yeasts produce ethanol from sugars by fermentation:
 C6H12O6 Æ 2CO2 + 2C2H5OH
Photosynthesis• , in which light energy captured by plant and algal chloroplasts is used to 
synthesize sugars from carbon dioxide and water:
 6CO2 + 6H2O + hn Æ C6H12O6 + 6O2Environmental Biochemistry 625
Plants cannot always get the energy that they need from sunlight. During the dark, they must use 
stored food. Plant cells, like animal cells, contain mitochondria in which stored food is converted to 
energy by cellular respiration.
Plant cells, which use sunlight as a source of energy and CO2 as a source of carbon, are said to 
be autotrophic . In contrast, animal cells must depend upon organic material manufactured by plants 
for their food. These are called heterotrophic  cells. They act as “middlemen” in the chemical reac-
tion between oxygen and food material using the energy from the reaction to carry out their life 
processes.
22.10 METABOLISM OF XENOBIOTIC COMPOUNDS
When toxicants or their metabolic precursors ( protoxicants ) enter a living organism, they may 
undergo several processes, including those that may make them more toxic or that detoxify them. 
Chapter 23 discusses the metabolic processes that toxicants undergo and the mechanisms by which 
they may cause damage to an organism. Emphasis is placed on xenobiotic compounds , which are 
those that are normally foreign to living organisms; on chemical aspects; and on processes that lead 
to products that can be eliminated from the organism. Of particular importance is intermediary 
xenobiotic metabolism  which results in the formation of somewhat transient species that are differ-
ent from both those ingested and the ultimate product that is excreted. These species may have 
signifi  cant toxicological effects. Xenobiotic compounds in general are acted upon by enzymes that 
function on a material that is in the body naturally—an endogenous substrate . For example, fl  avin-
containing mono-oxygenase enzyme acts upon endogenous cysteamine to convert it to cystamine, 
but also functions to oxidize xenobiotic nitrogen and sulfur compounds.
Biotransformation  r e f e r s  t o  c h a n g e s  i n  x e n o b i o t i c  c o m p o u n d s  a s  a  r e s u l t  o f  e n z y m e  a c t i o n .  
Reactions that are not mediated by enzymes may also be important in some cases. As examples of 
nonenzymatic transformations, some xenobiotic compounds bond with endogenous biochemical 
species without an enzyme catalyst, undergo hydrolysis in body fl  uid media, or undergo oxidation/
reduction processes. The metabolic Phase I and Phase II reactions of xenobiotics discussed here and 
in Chapter 23 are enzymatic, however.
The likelihood that a xenobiotic species will undergo enzymatic metabolism in the body 
depends upon the chemical nature of the species. Compounds with a high degree of polarity, 
such as relatively ionizable carboxylic acids, are less likely to enter the body system and, when 
they do, tend to be quickly excreted. Therefore, such compounds are unavailable, or only avail-
able for a short time, for enzymatic metabolism. Volatile compounds, such as dichloromethane 
or diethyl ether, are expelled so quickly from the lungs that enzymatic metabolism is less likely. 
This leaves nonpolar lipophilic compounds , those that are relatively less soluble in aqueous 
biological fl  uids and more attracted to lipid species, as the most likely candidates for enzymatic 
metabolic reactions. Of these, the ones that are resistant to enzymatic attack (e.g., PCBs) tend to 
bioaccumulate in lipid tissue.
Xenobiotic species may be metabolized in many body tissues and organs. As part of the body’s 
defense against the entry of xenobiotic species, the most prominent sites of xenobiotic metabolism 
are those associated with entry into the body, such as the skin and lungs. The gut wall through 
which xenobiotic species enter the body from the gastrointestinal tract is also a site of signifi  cant 
xenobiotic compound metabolism. The liver is of particular signifi  cance because materials entering 
systemic circulation from the gastrointestinal tract must fi  rst traverse the liver. 
22.10.1  PHASE I AND PHASE II R EACTIONS
The processes that most xenobiotics undergo in the body can be divided into the two categories of 
Phase I reactions and Phase II reactions. A Phase I reaction  introduces reactive, polar functional 
groups into lipophilic (“fat-seeking”) toxicant molecules. In their unmodifi  ed forms, such toxicant 626 Environmental Chemistry
molecules tend to pass through lipid-containing cell membranes and may be bound to lipoproteins, 
in which form they are transported through the body. Because of the functional group present, the 
product of a Phase I reaction is usually more water-soluble than the parent xenobiotic species, and 
more importantly, possesses a “chemical handle” to which a substrate material in the body may 
become attached so that the toxicant can be eliminated from the body. The binding of such a sub-
strate is a Phase II reaction , and it produces a conjugation  product that is amenable to excretion 
from the body.
In general, the changes in structure and properties of a compound that result from a Phase I reac-
tion are relatively mild. Phase II processes, however, usually produce species that are much different 
from the parent compounds. It should be emphasized that not all xenobiotic compounds undergo both 
Phase I and Phase II reactions. Such a compound may undergo only a Phase I reaction and be excreted 
directly from the body. Or a compound that already possesses an appropriate functional group capa-
ble of  conjugation may undergo a Phase II reaction without a preceding Phase I reaction. Phase I and 
Phase II reactions are discussed in more detail as they relate to toxicological chemistry in Chapters 
23 and 24.

23.1 INTRODUCTION TO TOXICOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
Ultimately, most pollutants and hazardous substances are of concern because of their toxic effects. 
The general aspects of these effects are addressed in this chapter under the heading toxicological 
chemistry; the toxicological chemistry of specifi  c classes of chemical substances is addressed in 
this chapter. In order to understand toxicological chemistry, it is essential to have some  understanding 
of biochemistry, the science that deals with chemical processes and materials in living systems. 
Biochemistry was summarized in Chapter 22.
23.1.1 T OXICOLOGY
A poison , or toxicant , is a substance that is harmful to living organisms because of its detrimental 
effects on tissues, organs, or biological processes. Common end point effects of toxic substances are 
destruction of cells, mutation of DNA leading to cancer, and disruption of the signaling mechanisms 
by which cell development and function are controlled. Most toxicants are foreign to the bodies of 
individuals that are affected (see xenobiotics in Section 23.5) and tend to have an affi  nity for lipids. 
Therefore, they have a tendency to cross the lipid membranes of cells and to build up to toxic levels. 
In many cases toxicants undergo metabolism to produce an active species that causes poisoning.
Toxicology  is the science of poisons. Whether a substance is poisonous depends upon the type of 
organism exposed, the amount of the substance, and the route of exposure. In the case of human 
exposure, the degree of harm done by a poison can depend strongly upon whether the exposure is to 
the skin, by inhalation, or through ingestion.
Toxicants to which subjects are exposed to in the environment or occupationally may be in  several 
different physical forms. This may be illustrated for toxicants that are inhaled. Gases are substances 
such as carbon monoxide in air that are normally in the gaseous state under ambient conditions of tem-
perature and pressure. Vapors are gas-phase materials that have evaporated or sublimed from liquids or 
solids. Dusts are respirable solid particles produced by grinding bulk  solids, whereas fumes are solid 
particles from the condensation of vapors, often metals or metal oxides. Mists are liquid droplets.
Often a toxic substance is in solution or mixed with other substances. A substance with which the 
toxicant is associated (the solvent in which it is dissolved or the solid medium in which it is  dispersed) 
is called the  matrix . The matrix may have a strong effect upon the toxicity of the toxicant.
There are numerous variables related to the ways in which organisms are exposed to toxic  substances. 
One of the most crucial of these, dose, is discussed in Section 23.2. Another important factor is the  
toxicant concentration , which may range from the pure substance (100%) down to a very dilute solu-
tion of a highly potent poison. Both the duration of exposure per exposure incident and the frequency 
of exposure are important. The rate of exposure and the total time period over which the organism is 
exposed are both important situational variables. The exposure site and route also affect toxicity.
It is possible to classify exposures on the basis of acute versus chronic and local versus systemic 
exposure, giving four general categories. Acute local exposure occurs at a specifi  c location over a 
time period of a few seconds to a few hours and may affect the exposure site, particularly the skin, 
eyes, or mucous membranes. The same parts of the body can be affected by chronic local exposure, 630 Environmental Chemistry
for which the time span may be as long as several years. Acute systemic exposure is a brief exposure 
or exposure to a single dose and occurs with toxicants that can enter the body, such as by inhalation 
or ingestion, and affect organs, such as the liver, that are remote from the entry site. Chronic  systemic 
exposure differs in that the exposure occurs over a prolonged time period.
In discussing exposure sites for toxicants it is useful to consider the major routes and sites of 
exposure, distribution, and elimination of toxicants in the body as shown in Figure 23.1. The major 
routes of accidental or intentional exposure to toxicants by humans and other animals are the skin 
(percutaneous or dermal route), the lungs (inhalation, respiration, pulmonary route), and the mouth 
(oral route); minor routes of exposure are rectal, vaginal, and parenteral (intravenous or  intramuscular, 
a common means for the administration of drugs or toxic substances in test subjects). Of these, the 
dermal route is the most diffi  cult to quantify. It is particularly important in children, whose  activities 
bring them into contact with contaminated dirt, pesticides, household chemicals, and other 
 environmental pollutants. Furthermore, the skin of children is relatively more permeable to toxic 
substances, increasing their risk of dermal exposure.
The way that a toxic substance is introduced into the complex system of an organism is strongly 
dependent upon the physical and chemical properties of the substance. The pulmonary system is 
most likely to take in toxic gases or very fi  ne, respirable solid or liquid particles. In other than a 
respirable form, a solid usually enters the body orally. Absorption through the skin is most likely for 
liquids, solutes in solution, and semisolids, such as sludges.
The defensive barriers that a toxicant may encounter vary with the route of exposure. Toxic 
 substances ingested orally are absorbed through the intestinal epithelium, which has detoxifi  cation 
systems that help reduce the effects of the substances. Toxic elemental mercury is absorbed through 
the alveoli in the lungs much more readily than through the skin or gastrointestinal tract. Most test 
exposures to animals are through ingestion or gavage (introduction into the stomach through a 
tube). Pulmonary exposure is often favored with subjects that may exhibit refractory behavior when

centration and effect of a xenobiotic substance in the blood. However, pathways used experimentally 
that are almost certain not to be signifi  cant in accidental exposures can give misleading results 
when they avoid the body’s natural defense mechanisms.
An interesting historical example of the importance of the route of exposure to toxicants is  provided 
by cancer caused by contact of coal tar with skin. The major barrier to dermal absorption of toxicants 
is the  stratum corneum , or horny layer. The permeability of skin is inversely  proportional to the 
thickness of this layer, which varies by location on the body in the order soles and palms > abdomen, 
back, legs, arms > genital (perineal) area. Evidence of the susceptibility of the genital area to absorp-
tion of toxic substances is to be found in accounts of the high incidence of cancer of the scrotum 
among chimney sweeps in London described by Sir Percival Pott, Surgeon General of Britain during 
the reign of King George III. The cancer-causing agent was coal tar condensed in chimneys. This 
material was more readily absorbed through the skin in the genital areas than elsewhere, leading to 
a high incidence of scrotal cancer. (The chimney sweeps’ conditions were aggravated by their lack of 
appreciation of basic hygienic practices, such as bathing and regular changes of underclothing.)
Organisms can serve as indicators of various kinds of pollutants. In this application, organisms 
are known as  biomonitors . For example, higher plants, fungi, lichens, and mosses can be important 
biomonitors for heavy metal pollutants in the environment.
23.1.2 S YNERGISM , POTENTIATION , AND ANTAGONISM
The biological effects of two or more toxic substances can be different in kind and degree from 
those of one of the substances alone. One of the ways in which this can occur is when one substance 
affects the way in which another undergoes any of the steps in the kinetic phase as discussed in 
Section 23.7 and illustrated in Figure 23.9. Chemical interaction between substances may affect 
their toxicities. Both substances may act upon the same physiologic function, or two substances may 
compete for binding to the same receptor (molecule or other entity acted upon by a toxicant). When 
both substances have the same physiologic function, their effects may be simply additive or they 
may be synergistic (the total effect is greater than the sum of the effects of each separately). 
Potentiation occurs when an inactive substance enhances the action of an active one, and antago-
nism when an active substance decreases the effect of another active one.
23.2 DOSE–RESPONSE RELATIONSHIPS
Toxicants have widely varying effects upon organisms. Quantitatively, these variations include 
minimum levels at which the onset of an effect is observed, the sensitivity of the organism to small 
increments of toxicant, and levels at which the ultimate effect (particularly death) occurs in most 
exposed organisms. Some essential substances, such as nutrient minerals, have optimum ranges 
above and below which detrimental effects are observed (see Section 23.5 and Figure 23.4).
Factors such as those just outlined are taken into account by the dose–response relationship, which 
is one of the key concepts of toxicology. Dose is the amount, usually per unit body mass, of a toxicant 
to which an organism is exposed. Response is the effect upon an organism resulting from exposure to 
a toxicant. In order to defi  ne a dose–response relationship, it is necessary to specify a particular 
response, such as death of the organism, as well as the conditions under which the response is obtained, 
such as the length of time from administration of the dose. Consider a specifi  c response of a population 
of the same kinds of organisms. At relatively low doses, none of the organisms exhibits the response 
(e.g., all live), whereas at higher doses all of the organisms exhibit the response (e.g., all die). In 
between, there is a range of doses over which some of the organisms respond in the specifi  ed manner 
and others do not, thereby defi  ning a dose–response curve. Dose–response relationships differ among 
different kinds and strains of organisms, types of tissues, and populations of cells.632 Environmental Chemistry
Figure 23.2 shows a generalized dose–response curve. Such a plot may be obtained, for example, by 
administering different doses of a poison in a uniform manner to a homogeneous population of test ani-
mals and plotting the cumulative percentage of deaths as a function of the log of the dose. The dose cor-
responding to the mid-point (infl  ection point) of the resulting S-shaped curve is the statistical estimate of 
the dose that would kill 50% of the subjects and is designated as LD50. The estimated doses at which 5% 
(LD5) and 95% (LD95) of the test subjects die are obtained from the graph by reading the dose levels for 
5% and 95% fatalities, respectively. A relatively small difference between LD5 and LD95 is refl  ected by a 
steeper S-shaped curve, and vice versa. Statistically, 68% of all values on a dose–response curve fall 
within ±1 standard deviation of the mean at LD50 and encompass the range from LD16 to LD84.
23.3 RELATIVE TOXICITIES
Table 23.1 illustrates standard toxicity ratings t h a t  a r e  u s e d  t o  d e s c r i b e  e s t i m a t e d  t o x i c i t i e s  o f  
various substances to humans. In terms of fatal doses to an adult human of average size, a “taste” of 
a supertoxic substance (just a few drops or less) is fatal. A teaspoonful of a very toxic substance 
could have the same effect. However, as much as a quart of a slightly toxic substance might be 
required to kill an adult human.
When there is a substantial difference between LD50 values of two different substances, the one 
with the lower value is said to be the more  potent . Such a comparison must assume that the dose–
response curves for the two substances being compared have similar slopes.
23.3.1  NONLETHAL  EFFECTS
So far, toxicities have been described primarily in terms of the ultimate effect—deaths of organisms 
or lethality. This is obviously an irreversible consequence of exposure. In many, and perhaps most, 
cases, sublethal and reversible effects are of greater importance. This is obviously true of drugs, 
where death from exposure to a registered therapeutic agent is rare, but other effects, both detrimen-
tal and benefi  cial, are usually observed. By their very nature, drugs alter biological processes; there-
fore, the potential for harm is almost always present. The major consideration in establishing drug 
dose is to fi  nd a dose that has an adequate therapeutic effect without undesirable side effects. A 
dose–response curve can be established for a drug that progresses from noneffective levels through 
effective, harmful, and even lethal levels. A low slope for this curve indicates a wide range of effec-
tive dose and a wide margin of safety (see Figure 23.3). This term applies to other substances, such 
as pesticides, for which it is desirable to have a large difference between the dose that kills a target 
species and that which harms a desirable species.FIGURE 23.2 Illustration of a dose–response curve in which the response is the death of the organism. The

23.4 REVERSIBILITY AND SENSITIVITY
Sublethal doses of most toxic substances are eventually eliminated from an organism’s system. If there 
is no lasting effect from the exposure, it is said to be  reversible . However, if the effect is  per manent, it 
is termed  irreversible . Irreversible effects of exposure remain after the toxic substance  is eliminated 
from the organism. Figure 23.3 illustrates these two kinds of effects. For various  chemicals and diffe-
rent subjects, toxic effects may range from the totally reversible to the totally irreversible.
23.4.1 H YPERSENSITIVITY  AND HYPOSENSITIVITY
Examination of the dose–response curve shown in Figure 23.2 reveals that some subjects are very 
sensitive to a particular poison (e.g., those killed at a dose corresponding to LD5), whereas others are 
very resistant to the same substance (e.g., those surviving a dose corresponding to LD95). These two 
kinds of responses illustrate hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity , respectively; subjects in the mid-
range of the dose–response curve are termed  normals . These variations in response tend to compli-
cate toxicology in that there is no specifi  c dose guaranteed to yield a particular response, even in a 
homogeneous population.
In some cases hypersensitivity is induced. After one or more doses of a chemical, a subject may 
develop an extreme reaction to it. This occurs with penicillin, for example, in cases where people 
develop such a severe allergic response to the antibiotic that exposure is fatal if countermeasures are 
not taken.
23.5 XENOBIOTIC AND ENDOGENOUS SUBSTANCES
Xenobiotic substances are those that are foreign to a living system, whereas those that occur natu-
rally in a biologic system are termed  endogenous . Xenobiotic substances that cause harm in organ-
isms are commonly metabolized by them. The levels of endogenous substances must usually fall 
within a particular concentration range in order for metabolic processes to occur normally. Levels 
below a normal range may result in a defi  ciency response or even death, and the same effects may 
occur above the normal range. This kind of response is illustrated in Figure 23.4.
Examples of endogenous substances in organisms include various hormones, glucose (blood 
sugar), and some essential metal ions, including Ca2+, K+, and Na+. The optimum level of calcium 
in human blood serum occurs over a rather narrow range of 9–9.5 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). 
Below these values a defi  ciency response known as hypocalcemia occurs, manifested by muscle 
cramping. At serum levels above about 10.5 mg/dL hypercalcemia occurs, the major effect of which 
is kidney malfunction.

23.6 TOXICOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
23.6.1 T OXICOLOGICAL  CHEMISTRY  DEFINED
Toxicological chemistry is the science that deals with the chemical nature and reactions of toxic 
substances, including their origins, uses, and chemical aspects of exposure, fates, and disposal.1 
Toxicological chemistry addresses the relationships between the chemical properties and molecular 
structures of molecules and their toxicological effects. Figure 23.5 outlines the terms discussed 
above and the relationships among them.
Much of what is known about xenobiotic substances in living systems is based upon intensive 
research upon pharmaceutical compounds in organisms. Pharmacodynamics deals with what a 
drug does to a body including the dose–response relationship, sites and mechanisms of pharmaceu-
tical actions, therapeutic effects, and side effects. What the body does to a drug is addressed by  
pharmacokinetics , including uptake, distribution, metabolism, retention, and excretion.
23.6.2 T OXICANTS  IN THE BODY
The processes by which organisms metabolize xenobiotic species are enzyme-catalyzed Phase I and 
Phase II reactions, which are described briefl  y here. The substances that undergo these reactions are 
treated theoretically by the science of  quantitative structure-activity relationships  (QSAR), which 
relates the chemical nature of substances to their biochemical reactions.
23.6.2.1 Phase I Reactions
Lipophilic xenobiotic species in the body tend to undergo Phase I reactions that make them more 
water-soluble and reactive by the attachment of polar functional groups, such as –OH (Figure 23.6). 
Most Phase I processes are “microsomal mixed-function oxidase” reactions catalyzed by the cyto-
chrome P-450 enzyme system, associated with the endoplasmic reticulum of the cell and occurring 
most abundantly in the liver of vertebrates.2 An example of a Phase I reaction of a xenobiotic is 
epoxide formation of chloroprene, used to make solvent-resistant synthetic rubbers:

23.6.2.2 Phase II Reactions
A Phase II reaction occurs when an endogenous species is attached by enzyme action to a polar 
functional group which often, though not always, is the result of a Phase I reaction on a xenobiotic 
species. Phase II reactions are called conjugation reactions in which enzymes attach conjugating 
agents to xenobiotics, their Phase I reaction products, and nonxenobiotic compounds (Figure 23.7). 
The conjugation product of such a reaction is usually less toxic than the original xenobiotic 
 compound, less lipid-soluble, more water-soluble, and more readily eliminated from the body. 
The major conjugating agents and the enzymes that catalyze their Phase II reactions are glucuronide 
(UDP glucuronyltransferase enzyme), glutathione (glutathionetransferase enzyme), sulfate (sulfo-
transfe rase enzyme), and acetyl (acetylation by acetyltransferase enzymes). The most abundant 
 conjugation products are glucuronides. A glucuronide conjugate is illustrated in Figure 23.8, where 
–X–R represents a xenobiotic species conjugated to glucuronide, and R is an organic moiety. FIGURE 23.6 Illustration of Phase I reactions.Product that is more water-

23.7 KINETIC PHASE AND DYNAMIC PHASE
23.7.1  KINETIC  PHASE
The major routes and sites of absorption, metabolism, binding, and excretion of toxic substances in 
the body are illustrated in Figure 23.1. Toxicants in the body are metabolized, transported, and 
excreted; they have adverse biochemical effects; and they cause manifestations of poisoning. It is 
convenient to divide these processes into two major phases, a kinetic phase and a dynamic phase.
In the  kinetic phase , a toxicant or the metabolic precursor of a toxic substance ( protoxicant ) may 
undergo absorption, metabolism, temporary storage, distribution, and excretion, as illustrated in 
Figure 23.9. A toxicant that is absorbed may be passed through the kinetic phase unchanged as an  
active parent compound , metabolized to a detoxifi  ed metabolite that is excreted, or converted to a 
toxic  active metabolite . These processes occur through Phase I and Phase II reactions discussed 
above.
23.7.2  DYNAMIC  PHASE
In the dynamic phase (Figure 23.10), a toxicant or toxic metabolite interacts with cells, tissues, or 
organs in the body to cause some toxic response. The three major subdivisions of the dynamic phase 
are the following:
Primary reaction • with a receptor or target organ
A •  biochemical response
Observable effects• 
23.7.2.1 Primary Reaction in the Dynamic Phase
A toxicant or an active metabolite reacts with a receptor. The process leading to a toxic response is 
initiated when such a reaction occurs. A typical example is when benzene epoxide, the initial pro-
duct of the Phase I reaction of benzene (see Figure 24.1), forms an adduct with a nucleic acid unit in 
FIGURE 23.9 Processes involving toxicants or protoxicants in the kinetic phase.Toxicant

DNA (receptor) resulting in alteration of the DNA. (Many species that cause a toxic response are 
reactive intermediates, such as benzene epoxide, which have a brief lifetime but a strong tendency 
to undergo reactions leading to a toxic response while they are around.) DNA adduct formation with 
benzene epoxide is an irreversible reaction between a toxicant and a receptor. A reversible reaction 
that can result in a toxic response is illustrated by the binding between carbon monoxide and 
 oxygen-transporting hemoglobin (Hb) in blood:

23.7.2.2 Biochemical Effects in the Dynamic Phase
The binding of a toxicant to a receptor may result in some kind of biochemical effect. The major 
ones are the following:
Impairment of enzyme function by binding to the enzyme, coenzymes, metal activators of • 
enzymes, or enzyme substrates
Alteration of cell membrane or carriers in cell membranes• 
Interference with carbohydrate metabolism• 
Interference with lipid metabolism resulting in excess lipid accumulation (“fatty liver”)• 
Interference with respiration, the overall process by which electrons are transferred to • 
molecular oxygen in the biological oxidation of energy-yielding substrates
Stopping or interfering with protein biosynthesis by their action on DNA•

23.7.2.3 Responses to Toxicants
Among the more immediate and readily observed manifestations of poisoning are alterations in the 
vital signs of temperature , pulse rate , respiratory rate , and  blood pressure . Poisoning by some sub-
stances may cause an abnormal skin color (jaundiced, yellow skin from CCl4 poisoning) or exces-
sively moist or dry skin. Toxic levels of some materials or their metabolites cause the body to have 
unnatural odors , such as the bitter almond odor of HCN in tissues of victims of cyanide poisoning. 
Symptoms of poisoning manifested in the eye include miosis  (excessive or prolonged contraction of 
the eye pupil), mydriasis  (excessive pupil dilation), conjunctivitis  (infl ammation of the mucus mem-
brane that covers the front part of the eyeball and the inner lining of the eyelids), and nystagmus  
(involuntary movement of the eyeballs). Some poisons cause a moist condition of the mouth,  whereas 
others cause a dry mouth. Gastrointestinal tract effects including pain, vomiting, or paralytic ileus 
(stoppage of the normal peristalsis movement of the intestines) occur as a result of poisoning by a 
number of toxic substances.
Central nervous system poisoning may be manifested by convulsions , paralysis , hallucinations , 
and ataxia  (lack of coordination of voluntary movements of the body), as well as abnormal behavior, 
including agitation, hyperactivity, disorientation, and delirium. Severe poisoning by some sub-
stances, including organophosphates and carbamates, causes coma , the term used to describe a 
lowered level of consciousness.
Prominent among the more chronic responses to toxicant exposure are mutations, cancer, and 
birth defects and effects on the immune system. Other observable effects, some of which may occur 
soon after exposure, include gastrointestinal illness, cardiovascular disease, hepatic (liver) disease, 
renal (kidney) malfunction, neurologic symptoms (central and peripheral nervous systems), and 
skin abnormalities (rash, dermatitis).
Often the effects of toxicant exposure are subclinical in nature. The most common of these are 
some kinds of damage to the immune system, chromosomal abnormalities, modifi  cation of func-
tions of liver enzymes, and slowing of conduction of nerve impulses.
23.8  TERATOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, CARCINOGENESIS, AND EFFECTS 
ON THE IMMUNE AND REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS
23.8.1 T ERATOGENESIS
Teratogens  are chemical species that cause birth defects. These usually arise from damage to embr-
yonic or fetal cells. However, mutations in germ cells (egg or sperm cells) may cause birth defects, 
such as Down’s syndrome.
The biochemical mechanisms of teratogenesis are varied. They include enzyme inhibition by 
xenobiotics; deprivation of the fetus of essential substrates, such as vitamins; interference with 
energy supply; or alteration of the permeability of the placental membrane.
Fetuses exposed to toxic substances in utero  are the most vulnerable to the effects of xenobiotics. 
Such toxicants can traverse the placental barrier and enter the fetal blood stream, the detoxifi  cation 
enzyme systems of fetuses are not as effective as they become after birth, and their organ systems 
are immature and subject to damage during development. The result of such exposures can be birth 
defects, retardation of interuterine growth, and later development of affl  ictions including diabetes 
and coronary artery disease.3
23.8.2 M UTAGENESIS
Mutagens  alter DNA to produce inheritable traits. Although mutation is a natural process that occurs 
even in the absence of xenobiotic substances, most mutations are harmful. The mechanisms of 
mutagenicity are similar to those of carcinogenicity, and mutagens often cause birth defects as well. 
Therefore, mutagenic hazardous substances are of major toxicological concern.640 Environmental Chemistry
23.8.2.1 Biochemistry of Mutagenesis
T o understand the biochemistry of mutagenesis, it is important to recall from Chapter 22 that DNA 
contains the nitrogenous bases adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. The order in which these bases 
occur in DNA determines the nature and structure of newly produced RNA, a substance generated as a 
step in the synthesis of new proteins and enzymes in cells. Exchange, addition, or deletion of any of the 
nitrogenous bases in DNA alters the nature of RNA produced and can change vital life processes, such 
as the synthesis of an important enzyme. This phenomenon, which can be caused by xenobiotic com-
pounds, is a mutation that can be passed on to progeny, usually with detrimental results.
There are several ways in which xenobiotic species may cause mutations. It is beyond the scope 
of this work to discuss these mechanisms in detail. For the most part, however, mutations due to 
xenobiotic substances are the result of chemical alterations of DNA, such as those discussed in the 
two examples below.
Nitrous acid, HNO2, is an example of a chemical mutagen that is often used to cause mutations 
in bacteria. To understand the mutagenic activity of nitrous acid it should be noted that three of the 
nitrogenous bases—adenine, guanine, and cytosine—contain the amino group, –NH2. The action 
of nitrous acid is to replace amino groups with a hydroxy group. When this occurs, the DNA may 
not function in the intended manner, causing a mutation to occur.
Alkylation , the attachment of a small alkyl group, such as –CH3 or –C2H5, to an N atom on one 
of the nitrogenous bases in DNA, is one of the most common mechanisms leading to mutation. The 
methylation of “7” nitrogen in guanine in DNA to form N-methylguanine is shown in Figure 23.11. 
O-alkylation may also occur by attachment of a methyl or other alkyl group to the oxygen atom in 
guanine.
A number of mutagenic substances act as alkylating agents. Prominent among these are the com-
pounds shown in Figure 23.12.
Alkylation occurs by way of generation of positively charged electrophilic species that bond to 
electron-rich nitrogen or oxygen atoms on the nitrogenous bases in DNA. The generation of such 
species usually occurs by way of biochemical and chemical processes. For example, dimethylnitro-
samine (structural formula in Figure 23.12) is activated by oxidation through cellular NADPH to 
produce the following highly reactive intermediate:

One of the more notable mutagens is tris(2,3-dibromopropyl)phosphate, commonly called “tris,” 
that was used as a fl  ame retardant in children’s sleepwear. Tris was found to be mutagenic in experi-
mental animals and metabolites of it were found in children wearing the treated sleepwear. This 
strongly suggested that tris is absorbed through the skin and its uses were discontinued.
23.8.3 C ARCINOGENESIS
Cancer is a condition characterized by the uncontrolled replication and growth of the body’s own 
(somatic) cells. Carcinogenic agents  may be categorized as follows:
Chemical agents, such as nitrosamines and PAHs• 
Biological agents, such as hepadnaviruses or retroviruses• 
Ionizing radiation, such as x-rays• 
Genetic factors, such as selective breeding• 
Clearly, in some cases, cancer is the result of the action of synthetic and naturally occurring 
chemicals. The role of xenobiotic chemicals in causing cancer is called chemical carcinogenesis . It 
is often regarded as the single most important facet of toxicology and is clearly the one that receives 
the most publicity.
Chemical carcinogenesis has a long history. As noted earlier in this chapter, in 1775 Sir Percival 
Pott, Surgeon General serving under King George III of England, observed that chimney sweeps in 
London had a very high incidence of cancer of the scrotum, which he related to their exposure to 
soot and tar from the burning of bituminous coal. Around 1900 a German surgeon, Ludwig Rehn, 
reported elevated incidences of bladder cancer in dye workers exposed to chemicals extracted from 
coal tar; 2-naphthylamine 
 NH2
2-Naphthylamine
was shown to be largely responsible. Other historical examples of carcinogenesis include observa-
tions of cancer from tobacco juice (1915), oral exposure to radium from painting luminescent watch 
dials (1929), tobacco smoke (1939), and asbestos (1960).
An important and unresolved question regarding carcinogens is the existence of thresholds above 
which carcinogenesis occurs and below which there is no effect.4 Rodent tests for carcinogens are 
normally conducted at doses 1000–10,000 times those to which humans are exposed and the prob-
abilities of substances causing cancer in humans are extrapolated linearly to the low doses at which 
humans are exposed under the assumption that there is no threshold below which the carcinogen has 
no effect. Some authorities believe that such extrapolations are unrealistic and overstate cancer risk 
in part because they do not take into account mechanisms possessed by humans to combat geno-
toxic and carcinogenic insults leading to cancer. Such mechanisms include detoxication and error-
free DNA repair.642 Environmental Chemistry
23.8.3.1 Biochemistry of Carcinogenesis
Large expenditures of time and money on the subject in recent years have yielded a much better 
understanding of the biochemical bases of chemical carcinogenesis. The overall processes for the 
induction of cancer may be quite complex, involving numerous steps. However, it is generally recog-
nized that there are two major steps in carcinogenesis: an initiation stage  followed by a promo tional 
stage . These steps are further subdivided as shown in Figure 23.13.
Initiation  of carcinogenesis may occur by the reaction of a DNA-reactive species  with DNA, or by 
the action of an epigenetic carcinogen  that does not react with DNA and is carcinogenic by some other 
mechanism. Most DNA-reactive species are genotoxic carcinogens  because they are also mutagens. 
These substances react irreversibly with DNA. They are either electrophilic or, more commonly, meta-
bolically activated to form electrophilic species, as is the case with  electrophilic +CH3 generated from 
dimethylnitrosamine, discussed under mutagenesis above. Most cancer- causing substances require 
metabolic activation to produce electrophilic species capable of forming adducts with DNA thereby 
causing gene mutations. The substances that are activated are called procarcinogens . The metabolic 
species actually responsible for carcinogenesis is termed an  ultimate carcinogen . Some species that are 
intermediate metabolites between precarcinogens and ultimate carcinogens are called proximate car-
cinogens . Carcinogens that do not require biochemical activation are categorized as primary  or direct-
acting carcinogens . Some procarcinogens and primary carcinogens are shown in Figure 23.14.
Most substances classifi  ed as epigenetic carcinogens are promoters  that act after initiation. 
Manifestations of promotion include increased numbers of tumor cells and decreased length of time 
for tumors to develop (shortened latency period). Promoters do not initiate cancer, are not electro-
philic, and do not bind with DNA. The classic example of a promoter is decanoyl phorbol acetate or 
phorbol myristate acetate, which is extracted from croton oil. 
23.8.3.2 Alkylating Agents in Carcinogenesis
Chemical carcinogens usually have the ability to form covalent bonds with macromolecular life 
molecules. Such covalent bonds can form with proteins, peptides, RNA, and DNA. Although most 
binding is with other kinds of molecules, which are more abundant, the DNA adducts are the signi-
fi cant ones in initiating cancer. Prominent among the species that bond to DNA in carcinogenesis 
are the alkylating agents that attach alkyl groups—methyl (CH3) or ethyl (C2H5)—to DNA. A simi-
lar type of compound, arylating agents , act to attach aryl moieties, such as the phenyl group,

to DNA. As shown by the examples in Figure 23.15, the alkyl and aryl groups become attached to N 
and O atoms in the nitrogenous bases that compose DNA. This alteration in DNA can trigger initia-
tion of the sequence of events that results in the growth and replication of neoplastic (cancerous) cells. 
The reactive species that donate alkyl groups in alkylation are usually formed by metabolic activa-
tion through the action of enzymes. This process was shown for conversion of dimethylnitrosamine 
to a methylating metabolic intermediate in the discussion of mutagenesis earlier in this section.
23.8.4 T ESTING  FOR CARCINOGENS
Only a few chemicals have defi  nitely been established as human carcinogens. A well documented 
example is vinyl chloride, CH2= CHCl, which is known to have caused a rare form of liver cancer 
(angiosarcoma) in individuals who cleaned autoclaves in the PVC fabrication industry. In some 
cases chemicals are known to be carcinogens from epidemiological studies of exposed humans. 
Animals are used to test for carcinogenicity, and the results can be extrapolated, although with much 
uncertainty, to humans.

23.8.4.1 Bruce Ames Test
Mutagenicity used to infer carcinogenicity is the basis of the Bruce Ames  test, in which observations 
are made of the reversion of mutant histidine-requiring Salmonella  bacteria back to a form that can 
synthesize its own histidine. The test makes use of enzymes in homogenized liver tissue to convert 
potential procarcinogens to ultimate carcinogens. Histidine-requiring Salmonella  bacteria are 
 inoculated onto a medium that does not contain histidine, and those that mutate back to a form that 
can synthesize histidine establish visible colonies that are assayed to indicate mutagenicity.
According to Bruce Ames, the pioneer developer of the test that bears his name, animal tests for 
carcinogens that make use of massive doses of chemicals have a misleading tendency to give results 
that cannot be accurately extrapolated to assess cancer risks from smaller doses of chemicals. This 
is because the huge doses of chemicals used kill large numbers of cells, which the organism’s body 
attempts to replace with new cells. Rapidly dividing cells greatly increase the likelihood of muta-
tions that result in cancer simply as the result of rapid cell proliferation, not genotoxicity.
23.8.5 I MMUNE  SYSTEM  RESPONSE
The immune system  acts as the body’s natural defense system to protect it from xenobiotic chemi-
cals; infectious agents, such as viruses or bacteria; and neoplastic cells, which give rise to cancerous 
tissue. Adverse effects on the body’s immune system are being increasingly recognized as impor-
tant consequences of exposure to hazardous substances. Toxicants can cause immunosuppression , 
which is the impairment of the body’s natural defense mechanisms. Xenobiotics can also cause the 
immune system to lose its ability to control cell proliferation, resulting in leukemia or lymphoma. 
Another major toxic response of the immune system is allergy  or hypersensitivity . This kind of 
condition results when the immune system overreacts to the presence of a foreign agent or its meta-
bolites in a self-destructive manner. Among the xenobiotic materials that can cause such reactions 
are beryllium, chromium, nickel, formaldehyde, some kinds of pesticides, resins, and plasticizers.
23.8.6 E NDOCRINE  DISRUPTION
Some pollutants are of particular concern because of their potential to disrupt the crucial endocrine 
gland activities that regulate the metabolism and reproductive functions of organisms.5 Because 
the y li v e in w ater , fi  sh, frogs, and reptiles such as alligators are particularly susceptible to such 
 substances present as water pollutants. Exposed fi  sh have exhibited reproductive dysfunction, alter-
ations in secondary sex characteristics, and abnormal serum steroid levels. Substances that exhibit 
hormone-like activity in test subjects are called hormonally active agents. Of particular concern are 
the substances that act like estrogen, the female sex hormone, that survive wastewater treatment 
and get into waterways receiving treated wastewater. Examples of such compounds are shown in 
Figure 23.16. Among such substances are estrogen, an endogenous sex hormone; 17a-ethinylestra-
diol, an ingredient of oral contraceptives, and chemicals from industrial and consumer sources, such 
as the last two examples in Figure 23.1 6. Estrogenic substances from artifi  cial sources are called 
xeno estrogens  and include antioxidants, bisphenol A, dioxins, PCBs, phytoestrogens (from plants), 
some pesticides (chlordecone, dieldrin, DDT and its metabolites, methoxychlor, toxaphene), 
preserva tives, and phthalic esters (butylbenzyl phthalate).
23.9 HEALTH HAZARDS
In recent years attention in toxicology has shifted away from readily recognized, usually severe, 
acute maladies that developed on a short time scale as a result of brief, intense exposure to toxicants, 
toward delayed, chronic, often less severe illnesses caused by long-term exposure to low levels of 
toxicants. Although the total impact of the latter kinds of health effects may be substantial, their 
assessment is very diffi  cult because of factors such as uncertainties in exposure, low occurrence 
above background levels of disease, and long latency periods.Toxicological Chemistry 645
23.9.1 A SSESSMENT  OF POTENTIAL  EXPOSURE
A critical step in assessing exposure to toxic substances, such as those from hazardous waste sites 
is evaluation of potentially exposed populations. The most direct approach to this is to determine 
chemicals or their metabolic products in organisms. For inorganic species this is most readily done 
for heavy metals, radionuclides, and some minerals, such as asbestos. Symptoms associated with 
exposure to particular chemicals may also be evaluated. Examples of such effects include readily 
apparent effects, for example, skin rashes, or subclinical effects, such as chromosomal damage.
23.9.2 E PIDEMIOLOGICAL  EVIDENCE
Epidemiological studies  applied to toxic environmental pollutants, such as those from hazardous 
wastes, attempt to correlate observations of particular illnesses with probable exposure to such 
wastes. There are two major approaches to such studies. One approach is to look for diseases known 
to be caused by particular agents in areas where exposure is likely from such agents in hazardous 
wastes. A second approach is to look for clusters  consisting of an abnormally large number of cases 
of a particular disease in a limited geographic area, then attempt to locate sources of exposure to FIGURE 23.16 Endocrine disruptors that may be discharged into the environment and affect organisms. 
Estrone (a natural estrogen), 17 a-ethinylestradiol (a constituent of oral contraceptives), 17 b-estradiol, and 
estriol are steroid estrogens. Both 4- tert-octylphenol and p-nonylphenol are breakdown products of nonionic 
surfactants, bisphenol A is an ingredient of epoxy resins and other polymers, genistein is synthesized by trees 
to make the wood disease-resistant and is present in pulp mill discharges, and dibutylphthalate is a plasticizer 
in plastics.O p-Nonylphenol 4-tert- Octylphenol

hazardous wastes that may be responsible. The most common types of maladies observed in clusters 
are spontaneous abortions, birth defects, and particular types of cancer.
Epidemiologic studies are complicated by long latency periods from exposure to onset of disease, 
lack of specifi  city in the correlation between exposure to a particular waste and the occurrence of a 
disease, and background levels of a disease in the absence of exposure to a hazardous waste capable 
of causing the disease.
23.9.3 E STIMATION  OF HEALTH EFFECTS  RISKS
An important part of estimating the risks of adverse health effects from exposure to toxicants invol-
ves extrapolation from experimentally observable data. Usually the end result needed is an estimate 
of a low occurrence of a disease in humans after a long latency period resulting from low-level 
exposure to a toxicant for a long period of time. The data available are almost always taken from 
animals exposed to high levels of the substance for a relatively short period of time. Extrapolation 
is then made using linear or curvilinear projections to estimate the risk to human populations. There 
are, of course, very substantial uncertainties in this kind of approach.
23.9.4 R ISK ASSESSMENT
Toxicological considerations are very important in estimating potential dangers of pollutants and 
hazardous waste chemicals. One of the major ways in which toxicology interfaces with the area of 
hazardous wastes is in health risk assessment , providing guidance for risk management, cleanup, or 
regulation needed at a hazardous waste site based upon knowledge about the site and the chemical 
and toxicological properties of wastes in it. Risk assessment includes the factors of site characteris-
tics; substances present, including indicator species; potential receptors; potential exposure path-
ways; and uncertainty analysis. It may be divided into the following major components:
Identifi  cation of hazard • 
Exposure assessment• 
Dose–response assessment• 
Risk characterization•

24.1 INTRODUCTION
Toxicological chemistry , defi ned and discussed in Chapter 23, centers on the relationship between 
the chemical nature of toxicants and their toxicological effects. This chapter discusses this relation-
ship with regard to some of the major pollutants and hazardous substances. The fi  rst section deals 
with toxicological aspects of elements (particularly heavy metals), the presence of which in a com-
pound frequently means that the compound is toxic. It also discusses the toxicities of some com-
monly used elemental forms, such as the chemically uncombined elemental halogens. The following 
section discusses the toxicological chemistry of inorganic compounds, many of which are produced 
from industrial processes. It also pro vides a brief discussion of organometallic compounds. The 
next section deals with the toxicology of organic compounds. The toxicological properties of hydro-
carbons and oxygen-containing organic compounds are discussed along with other organic sub-
stances containing functional groups, such as alcohols and ketones. This section also discusses the 
toxicities of organic nitrogen, halide, sulfur, and phosphorus compounds, some of which are used as 
pesticides or military poisons. Finally, toxic natural products are discussed. 
24.1.1 ATSDR T OXICOLOGICAL  PROFILES
A very useful source of information about the toxicological chemistry of various kinds of toxic 
substances is published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health 
Service Agency for Toxic Substances, and Disease Registry ATSDR’s Toxicological Profi  les. The 
detailed documents pertaining to these substances, which are listed in Table 24.1, can be accessed 
through the website cited in the table.
24.2 TOXIC ELEMENTS AND ELEMENTAL FORMS
24.2.1 O ZONE
Ozone  (O3, see Chapters 9, 13, and 14) has several toxic effects. Air containing 1 ppm by volume 
ozone has a distinct odor. Inhalation of ozone at this level causes severe irritation and headache. 
Ozone irritates the eyes, upper respiratory system, and lungs. Inhalation of ozone can sometimes 
cause fatal pulmonary edema. Pulmonary  refers to lungs and edema  to an accumulation of fl  uid in 
tissue spaces; therefore, pulmonary edema  i s  an  a b n o rmal  a c c um ul a ti o n  o f  fl  uid in lung tissue. 
Chromosomal damage has been observed in subjects exposed to ozone.
Ozone generates free radicals in tissue. These reactive species can cause lipid peroxidation, 
 oxidation of sulfhydryl (–SH) groups, and other destructive oxidation processes. Compounds that 
protect organisms from the effects of ozone include radical scavengers, antioxidants, and com-
pounds containing sulfhydryl groups.650 Environmental Chemistry

24.2.2 W HITE PHOSPHORUS
Elemental white phosphorus can enter the body by inhalation, by skin contact, or orally. It is a sys-
temic poison, that is, one that is transported through the body to sites remote from its entry site. White 
phosphorus causes anemia, gastrointestinal system dysfunction, bone brittleness, and eye damage. 
Exposure also causes phossy jaw , a condition in which the jawbone deteriorates and becomes 
fractured.
24.2.3 E LEMENTAL  HALOGENS
Elemental fl u o r i n e  (F2) is a pale yellow, highly reactive gas that is a strong oxidant. It is a toxic 
irritant and attacks skin, eye tissue, and the mucous membranes of the nose and respiratory tract. 
Chlorine  (Cl2) gas reacts in water to produce a strongly oxidizing solution. This reaction is respon-
sible for some of the damage caused to the moist tissue lining the respiratory tract when the tissue 
is exposed to chlorine. The respiratory tract is rapidly irritated by exposure to 10–20 ppm of chlo-
rine gas in air, causing acute discomfort that warns of the presence of the toxicant. Even brief expo-
sure to 1000 ppm of Cl2 can be fatal.
Bromine  (Br2) is a volatile, dark red liquid that is toxic when inhaled or ingested. Like chlorine 
and fl  uorine, it is strongly irritating to the mucous tissue of the respiratory tract and eyes and may 
cause pulmonary edema. The toxicological hazard of bromine is limited somewhat because its 
irritating odor elicits a withdrawal response.
Elemental solid iodine  (I2) is irritating to the lungs much like Cl2 or Br2. However, the relatively 
low vapor pressure of iodine limits exposure to I2 vapor.
24.2.4 H EAVY METALS
Heavy metals  (Section 7.3) are toxic in their chemically combined forms and some, notably mer-
cury, are toxic in the elemental form. The toxic properties of some of the most hazardous heavy 
metals and metalloids are discussed here. 
Although not truly a heavy  metal, beryllium  (atomic mass 9.01) is one of the more hazardous 
toxic elements. Its most serious toxic effect is berylliosis, a condition manifested by lung fi  brosis 
and pneumonitis, which may develop after a latency period of 5–20 years. Beryllium is a hypersen-
sitizing agent and exposure to it causes skin granulomas and ulcerated skin. Beryllium was used in 
the nuclear  weapons program in the United States, and it is believed that 500–1000 cases of beryl-
lium poisoning have occurred or will occur in the future as a result of exposure to workers. In July TABLE 24.1 (continued)

Compensation Program of 2000 under which qualifi  ed workers with beryllium disease can receive 
a lump sum  payment of $150,000 as reimbursement for disability and medical care resulting from 
the disease.1
Cadmium  adversely affects several important enzymes; it can also cause painful osteomalacia 
(bone disease) and kidney damage. Inhalation of cadmium oxide dusts and fumes results in cad-
mium pneumonitis characterized by edema and pulmonary epithelium necrosis (death of tissue 
lining lungs).
Lead , widely distributed as metallic lead, inorganic compounds, and organometallic compounds, 
has a number of toxic effects, including inhibition of the synthesis of hemoglobin. It also adversely 
affects the central and peripheral nervous systems and the kidneys. Its toxicological effects have 
been widely studied. 
Arsenic  is a metalloid that forms a number of toxic compounds. The toxic +3 oxide, As2O3, is 
absorbed through the lungs and intestines. Biochemically, arsenic acts to coagulate proteins, forms 
complexes with coenzymes, and inhibits the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in essen-
tial metabolic processes involving the utilization of energy. Arsenic is the toxic agent in one of the 
greatest environmental catastrophes of the last century, the result of its ingestion through well water 
in Bangladesh is discussed in Chapter 7, Section 7.4.
An interesting historical footnote with respect to arsenic poisoning is that of the arsenic eaters  
who were smugglers traversing the Alps of southern Austria as recently as the early 1900s. By 
 carrying heavy loads on their backs through the mountains, they were able to evade tolls levied by 
local governmental bodies in the region. Starting with doses of arsenic trioxide of 10 mg twice 
a week, these individuals gradually raised their intake to more than 450 mg per week, which is 
almost 10 times the lower fatal dose for nonacclimated individuals. This enabled their bodies to 
switch from oxic sugar metabolism to the anoxic lactic acid cycle for their energy needs so that they 
could endure the vigorous exercise of carrying heavy loads of smuggled goods at high altitudes! One 
can only wonder how many potential arsenic eaters died in attempts to acclimate their bodies to this 
deadly poison.
Elemental mercury  vapor can enter the body through inhalation and be carried by the blood-
stream to the brain where it penetrates the blood–brain barrier. It disrupts metabolic processes in 
the brain causing tremor and psychopathological symptoms such as shyness, insomnia, depression, 
and irritability. Divalent ionic mercury, Hg2+, damages the kidney. Organometallic mercury com-
pounds are also very toxic, dimethylmercury, Hg(CH3)2, spectacularly so, killing most of the early 
investigators who fi  rst synthesized it.
24.3 TOXIC INORGANIC COMPOUNDS
24.3.1 C YANIDE
Both hydrogen cyanide  (HCN) and cyanide salts  (which contain CN- ion) are rapidly acting poi-
sons; a dose of only 60–90 mg is suffi  cient to kill a human. Metabolically, cyanide bonds to iron(III) 
in iron-containing ferricytochrome oxidase enzyme (see enzymes, Section 22.6), preventing its 
reduction to iron(II) in the oxidative phosphorylation process by which the body utilizes O2. This 
prevents utilization of oxygen in cells, so that metabolic processes cease.
24.3.2 C ARBON  MONOXIDE
Carbon monoxide , CO, is a common cause of accidental poisonings. At CO levels in air of 10 ppm, 
i m p a i r m e n t  o f  j u d g m e n t  a n d  v i s u a l  p e r c e p t i o n  o c c u r ;  e x p o s u r e  t o  1 0 0  p p m  c a u s e s  d i z z i n e s s ,  
 headache, and weariness; loss of consciousness occurs at 250 ppm; and inhalation of 1000 ppm Toxicological Chemistry of Chemical Substances 653
results in rapid death. Chronic long-term exposures to low levels of carbon monoxide are suspected 
of causing disorders of the respiratory system and the heart.
After entering the blood stream through the lungs, carbon monoxide reacts with hemoglobin 
(Hb) to convert oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb) to carboxyhemoglobin (COHb):
 O2Hb + CO /arrowpairrightleft COHb + O2 (24.1)
In this case, hemoglobin is the receptor (Section 23.7) acted on by the carbon monoxide toxicant. 
Carboxyhemoglobin is much more stable than oxyhemoglobin so that its formation prevents hemo-
globin from carrying oxygen to body tissues. The equilibrium constant expression for the preceding 
reaction is
   [COHb] _______ [O2Hb]   = M ¥   PCO ____ P CO 2   . (24.2)
where [COHb] and [O2Hb] are the equilibrium concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin and oxy-
hemoglobin, respectively, in blood, P denotes the partial pressures of CO and O2 in air, and M is 
the Haldane constant for which values of 210–220 are commonly used for adult human 
hemoglobin.
24.3.3 N ITROGEN  OXIDES
The two most common toxic oxides of nitrogen are NO and NO2, of which the latter is regarded as 
the more toxic. Nitrogen dioxide causes severe irritation of the innermost parts of the lungs resulting 
in pulmonary edema. In cases of severe exposures, fatal bronchiolitis fi  brosa obliterans  may develop 
approximately 3 weeks after exposure to NO2. Fatalities may result from even brief periods of inha-
lation of air containing 200–700 ppm of NO2. Biochemically, NO2 disrupts lactic dehydrogenase 
and some other enzyme systems, possibly acting much like ozone, a stronger oxidant mentioned in 
Section 24.2. Free radicals, particularly HO•, are likely formed in the body by the action of nitrogen 
dioxide and the compound probably causes lipid peroxidation  in which the C=C double bonds in 
unsaturated body lipids are attacked by free radicals and undergo chain reactions in the presence of 
O2, resulting in their oxidative destruction.
Nitrous oxide , N2O, is used as an oxidant gas and in dental surgery as a general anesthetic. This 
gas was once known as “laughing gas,” and was used in the late 1800s as a “recreational gas” at par-
ties held by some of our not-so-staid Victorian ancestors. Nitrous oxide is a central nervous system 
depressant and can act as an asphyxiant.
24.3.4 H YDROGEN  HALIDES
Hydrogen halides (general formula HX, where X is F, Cl, Br, or I) are relatively toxic gases. The 
most widely used of these gases are HF and HCl; their toxicities are discussed here.
24.3.4.1 Hydrogen Fluoride
Hydrogen fl  uoride  (HF, mp -83.1°C, bp 19.5°C) is used as a clear, colorless liquid or gas or as a 
30–60% aqueous solution of hydrofl  uoric acid , both referred to as HF here. Both are extreme irri-
tants to any part of the body that they contact, causing ulcers in affected areas of the upper respira-
tory tract. Lesions caused by contact with HF heal poorly, and tend to develop gangrene.
Fluoride ion, F-, is toxic in soluble fl  uoride sal ts, such as NaF , causing fl u o r o s i s , a condition 
characterized by bone abnormalities and mottled, soft teeth. Livestock are especially susceptible to 654 Environmental Chemistry
poisoning from fl  uoride fallout on grazing land; severely affl  icted animals become lame and even 
die. Industrial pollution has been a common source of toxic levels of fl  uoride. However, about 1 ppm 
of fl uoride used in some drinking water supplies prevents tooth decay. 
24.3.4.2 Hydrogen Chloride
Gaseous hydrogen chloride  and its aqueous solution, called hydrochloric acid , both denoted as HCl, 
are much less toxic than HF. Hydrochloric acid is a natural physiological fl  uid present as a dilute 
solution in the stomachs of humans and other animals. However, the inhalation of HCl vapor can 
cause spasms of the larynx as well as pulmonary edema and even death at high levels. The high affi  n-
ity of hydrogen chloride vapor for water tends to dehydrate the eyes and respiratory tract tissue.
24.3.5 I NTERHALOGEN  COMPOUNDS  AND HALOGEN  OXIDES
Interhalogen compounds, including ClF, BrCl, and BrF3, are extremely reactive and are potent oxi-
dants. They react with water to produce hydrohalic acid solutions (HF, HCl) and nascent oxygen 
{ O } . T oo reacti v e to enter bi o l o gi cal sy stems in their ori ginal chemi cal state, interhal o g en com-
pounds tend to be powerful corrosive irritants that acidify, oxidize, and dehydrate tissue, much like 
those of the elemental forms of the elements from which they are composed. Because of these 
effects, the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes of the mouth, throat, and pulmonary systems are 
especially susceptible to attack. 
Major halogen oxides, including fl  uorine monoxide (OF2), chlorine monoxide (Cl2O), chlorine 
dioxide (ClO2), chlorine heptoxide (Cl2O7), and bromine monoxide (Br2O), tend to be unstable, 
highly reactive, and toxic compounds that pose hazards similar to those of the interhalogen com-
pounds discussed above. Chlorine dioxide, the most commonly used halogen oxide, is employed for 
odor control and bleaching wood pulp. As a substitute for chlorine in water disinfection, it produces 
fewer undesirable chemical by-products, particularly trihalomethanes.
The most important of the oxyacids and their salts formed by halogens are hypochlorous acid, 
HOCl, and hypochlorites, such as NaOCl, used for bleaching and disinfection. The hypochlorites 
irritate the eyes, skin, and mucous membrane tissue because they react to produce active (nascent) 
oxygen ({O}) and acid as shown by the reaction below:
 HClO Æ H+ + Cl- + {O} (24.3)
24.3.6 I NORGANIC  COMPOUNDS  OF SILICON
Silica (SiO2, quartz) occurs in a variety of types of rocks such as sand, sandstone, and diatomaceous 
earth. Silicosis  resulting from human exposure to silica dust from construction materials, sandblasting, 
and other sources has been a common occupational disease. A type of pulmonary fi  brosis that causes 
lung nodules and makes victims more susceptible to pneumonia and other lung diseases, silicosis is one 
of the most common disabling conditions resulting from industrial exposure to hazardous substances. 
It can cause death from insuffi  cient oxygen or from heart failure in severe cases.
Silane, SiH4, and disilane, H3SiSiH3, are examples of inorganic silanes , which have H–Si bonds. 
Numerous organic (“organometallic”) silanes exist in which alkyl moieties are substituted for H. 
Little information is available regarding the toxicities of silanes. 
Silicon tetrachloride, SiCl4, is the only industrially signifi  cant compound of the silicon  tetra-
halides , a group of compounds with the general formula SiX4, where X is a halogen. The two com-
mercially produced silicon halohydrides , general formula H4-xSiXx, are dichlorosilane (SiH2Cl2) 
and trichlorosilane (SiHCl3). These compounds are used as intermediates in the synthesis of organo-
silicon compounds and in the production of high-purity silicon for semiconductors. Silicon tetra-
chloride and trichlorosilane, fuming liquids that react with water to give off HCl vapor have 
suffocating odors and are irritants to the eyes, nasal, and lung tissue.Toxicological Chemistry of Chemical Substances 655
24.3.7 A SBESTOS
Asbestos  is the name given to a group of fi  brous silicate minerals, typically those of the serpentine 
group, for which the approximate chemical formula is Mg3(Si2O5)(OH)4. Asbestos has been widely 
used in structural materials, brake linings, insulation, and pipe manufacture. Inhalation of asbestos 
may cause asbestosis (a pneumonia condition), mesothelioma (tumor of the mesothelial tissue lining 
the chest cavity adjacent to the lungs), and bronchogenic carcinoma (cancer originating with the air 
passages in the lungs ) so that uses of asbestos have been severely curtailed and widespread pro-
grams have been undertaken to remove the material from buildings.
24.3.8 I NORGANIC  PHOSPHORUS  COMPOUNDS
Phosphine  (PH3), a colorless gas that undergoes autoignition at 100°C, is a potential hazard in 
industrial processes and in the laboratory. Symptoms of potentially fatal poisoning from phosphine 
gas include pulmonary tract irritation, depression of the central nervous system, fatigue, vomiting, 
and diffi  cult, painful breathing.
Tetraphosphorus decoxide , P4O10, is produced as a fl  uffy white powder from the combustion of 
elemental phosphorus and reacts with water from air to form syrupy orthophosphoric acid. Because 
of the formation of acid by this reaction and its dehydrating action, P4O10 is a corrosive irritant to the 
skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. 
The most important of the phosphorus halides , general formulas PX3 and PX5, is phosphorus 
pentachloride used as a catalyst in organic synthesis, as a chlorinating agent, and as a raw material 
to make phosphorus oxychloride (POCl3). Because they react violently with water to produce the 
corresponding hydrogen halides and oxo phosphorus acids,
 PCl5 + 4H2O Æ H3PO4 + 5HCl (24.4)
the phosphorus halides are strong irritants to the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes.
The major phosphorus oxyhalide  in  c o mm e r c i al  u s e  i s  p h o s p h o ru s  o x y c hl o ri d e  (POC l3), a 
faintly yellow fuming liquid. Reacting with water to form toxic vapors of hydrochloric acid and 
phosphorus acid (H3PO3), phosphorus oxyhalide is a strong irritant to the eyes, skin, and mucous 
membranes.
24.3.9 I NORGANIC  COMPOUNDS  OF SULFUR
A colorless gas with a foul, rotten egg odor, hydrogen sulfi  de  is very toxic. In some cases, inhalation 
of H2S kills faster than even hydrogen cyanide; rapid death ensues from exposure to air containing 
more than about 1000 ppm H2S due to asphyxiation from respiratory system paralysis. Lower doses 
cause symptoms that include headache, dizziness, and excitement due to damage to the central ner-
vous system. General debility is one of the numerous effects of chronic H2S poisoning.
Sulfur dioxide , SO2, dissolves in water to produce sulfurous acid, H2SO3; hydrogen sulfi  te ion, 
HSO3-; and sulfi  te ion, SO32-. Because of its water solubility, sulfur dioxide is largely removed in the 
upper respiratory tract. It is an irritant to the eyes, skin, mucous membranes, and respiratory tract. 
Some individuals are hypersensitive to sodium sulfi  te (Na2SO3), which has been used as a chemical 
food preservative. Because of threats to hypersensitive individuals, these uses were severely 
restricted in the United States in early 1990.
Number one in synthetic chemical production, sulfuric acid  (H2SO4) is a severely corrosive poi-
son and dehydrating agent in the concentrated liquid form; it readily penetrates the skin to reach 
subcutaneous tissue causing tissue necrosis with effects resembling those of severe thermal burns. 
Sulfuric acid fumes and mists irritate the eyes and respiratory tract tissue, and industrial exposure 
has even caused tooth erosion in workers.656 Environmental Chemistry
The more important halides, oxides, and oxyhalides of sulfur are listed in Table 24.2. The major 
toxic effects of these compounds are given in the table.
24.3.10  PERCHLORATE
Perchlorate anion, ClO4-, is chemically unreactive and was long regarded as toxicologically insigni-
fi cant, but it is now known that it inhibits the action of iodide, I-, required for proper functioning of 
the thyroid. Physiologically, ClO4- competes with I- and diminishes iodide uptake by the thyroid to the 
extent that it has even been used to treat cases of hyperthyroidism. The reduction of I- uptake by ClO4- 
competition inhibits the production of thyroid hormones. This is of particular concern because of the 
role of thyroid hormones in brain development before and after birth. Iodide carriers that are inhibited 
by perchlorate have been studied in frogs.2 It is suspected that water contaminant ClO4- can alter sex 
ratios and inhibit metamorphosis, such as change from tadpoles to adult frogs, in amphibians.
24.3.11 O RGANOMETALLIC  COMPOUNDS
As discussed elsewhere in this book, a variety of toxic organometallic compounds are found in the 
environment. The toxicological properties of some organometallic compounds—pharmaceutical 
organoarsenicals, organomercury fungicides, and tetraethyllead antiknock gasoline additives—that 
were widely used in the past are well known. It is important to consider the potential toxicities of 
relatively newer organometallic compounds used in semiconductors as catalysts and for chemical 
synthesis.
Organometallic compounds often behave in the body in ways totally unlike the inorganic forms 
of the metals that they contain. This is due in large part to the fact that, compared to inorganic 
forms, organometallic compounds have an organic nature and higher lipid solubility.
24.3.11.1 Organolead Compounds
Perhaps the most notable toxic organometallic compound is tetraethyllead, Pb(C2H5)4, a colorless, 
oily liquid that was widely used as a gasoline additive to boost octane rating. Tetraethyllead has a 
strong affi  nity for lipids and can enter the body by all three common routes of inhalation, ingestion, 
and absorption through the skin. Acting differently from inorganic compounds in the body, it affects TABLE 24.2

the central nervous system with symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, restlessness, ataxia, psycho-
sis, and convulsions. Recovery from severe lead poisoning tends to be slow. In cases of fatal tetra-
ethyllead poisoning, death has occurred as soon as 1 or 2 days after exposure.
24.3.11.2 Organotin Compounds
The greatest number of organometallic compounds in commercial use are those of tin—tributyltin 
chloride and related tributyltin (TBT) compounds. These compounds have bactericidal, fungicidal, 
and insecticidal properties. They have particular environmental signifi  cance because of their wide-
spread applications as industrial biocides, now increasingly limited because of their environmental 
and toxicological effects. Organotin compounds are readily absorbed through the skin, sometimes 
causing a skin rash. They probably bind with sulfur groups on proteins and appear to interfere with 
mitochondrial function.
24.3.11.3 Carbonyls
Metal carbonyls, regarded as extremely hazardous because of their toxicities include nickel tetracar-
bonyl [Ni(CO)4], cobalt carbonyl, and iron pentacarbonyl. Some of the hazardous carbonyls are 
volatile and readily taken into the body through the respiratory tract or through the skin. The car-
bonyls affect tissue directly and they break do wn to to xic carbon mono xide and products of the 
metal, which have additional toxic effects.
24.3.11.4 Reaction Products of Organometallic Compounds
An example of the production of a toxic substance from the burning of an organometallic compound 
is provided by the combustion of diethylzinc:
 Zn(C2H5)2 + 7O2 Æ ZnO( s) + 5H2O(g) + 4CO2(g) (24.5)
Zinc oxide is used as a healing agent and food additive. However, inhalation of zinc oxide fume 
particles produced by the combustion of zinc organometallic compounds causes zinc metal fume 
fever . This is an uncomfortable condition characterized by elevated temperature and “chills.”
24.4 TOXICOLOGY OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS
24.4.1 A LKANE  HYDROCARBONS
Gaseous methane, ethane, propane, n-butane, and isobutane (both C4H10) are regarded as simple 
asphyxiants  that f orm mixtures wi th air containing insuffi  cient oxygen to support respiration. The 
most common toxicological occupational problem associated with the use of hydrocarbon liquids in 
the workplace is dermatitis, caused by dissolution of the fat portions of the skin and characterized by 
infl amed, dry, scaly skin. Inhalation of volatile liquid 5–8 carbon n-alkanes and branched-chain 
alkanes may cause central nervous system depression manifested by dizziness and loss of  coordination. 
Exposure to n-hexane and cyclohexane results in loss of myelin (a fatty substance constituting a sheath 
around certain nerve fi  bers) and degeneration of axons (part of a nerve cell through which nerve 
impulses are transferred out of the cell). This has resulted in multiple disorders of the nervous system 
(polyneuropathy ) including muscle weakness and impaired sensory function of the hands and feet. In 
the body, n-hexane is metabolized to 2,5-hexanedione, a Phase I oxidation product that can be observed 
in urine of exposed individuals and used as a biological monitor of exposure to n-hexane.

24.4.2 A LKENE AND ALKYNE  HYDROCARBONS
Ethylene, a widely used colorless gas with a somewhat sweet odor, acts as a simple asphyxiant and 
anesthetic to animals and is phytotoxic (toxic to plants). The toxicological properties of propylene 
(C3H6) are very similar to those of ethylene. Colorless, odorless, gaseous 1,3-butadiene is an irritant 
to the eyes and respiratory system mucous membranes; at higher levels it can cause unconsciousness 
and even death. It causes cancer in animals and is rated as a probable human carcinogen. Acetylene, 
H-C∫C-H, is a colorless gas with a garlic odor. It acts as an asphyxiant and narcotic, causing head-
ache, dizziness, and gastric disturbances. Some of these effects may be due to the presence of impu-
rities in the commercial product. 
24.4.3 B ENZENE  AND AROMATIC  HYDROCARBONS
Inhaled benzene is readily absorbed by blood, from which it is strongly taken up by fatty tissues. For 
the nonmetabolized compound, the process is reversible and benzene is excreted through the lungs. 
As shown in Figure 24.1, benzene is converted to phenol by a Phase I oxidation reaction (see 
Section 23.6) in the liver. The reactive and short-lived benzene epoxide intermediate known to 
occur in this reaction is probably responsible for much of the unique to xicity of benzene, which 
involves damage to bone marrow. In addition to phenol, several other oxygenated derivatives of 
benzene are produced when it is metabolized, as is trans ,trans -muconic acid, produced by cleavage 
of the benzene ring.
Benzene is a skin irritant, and progressively higher local exposures can cause skin redness (ery-
thema), burning sensations, fl  uid accumulation (edema), and blistering. Inhalation of air containing 
about 7 g/m3 of benzene causes acute poisoning within an hour because of a narcotic effect upon the 
central nervous system manifested progressively by excitation, depression, respiratory system fail-
ure, and death. Inhalation of air containing more than about 60 g/m3 of benzene can be fatal within 
a few minutes.
Long-term exposures to lower levels of benzene cause nonspecifi  c symptoms, including fatigue, 
headache, and appetite loss. Chronic benzene poisoning causes blood abnormalities, including a 
lowered white cell count, an abnormal increase in blood lymphocytes (colorless corpuscles intro-
duced to the blood from the lymph glands), anemia, a decrease in the number of blood platelets 
required for clotting (thrombocytopenia), and damage to bone marrow. It is thought that preleuke-
mia, leukemia, or cancer may result.

24.4.3.1 Toluene
Toluene, a colorless liquid boiling at 101.4°C, is classifi  ed as moderately toxic through inhalation or 
ingestion; it has a low toxicity by dermal exposure. Toluene can be tolerated without noticeable ill 
effects in ambient air up to 200 ppm. Exposure to 500 ppm may cause headache, nausea, lassitude, 
and impaired coordination without detectable physiological effects. Massive exposure to toluene has 
a narcotic effect, which can lead to coma. Because it possesses an aliphatic side chain that can be 
oxidized enzymatically to products that are readily excreted from the body (see the metabolic reac-
tion scheme in Figure 24.2), toluene is much less toxic than benzene.
24.4.3.2 Naphthalene
As is the case with benzene, naphthalene  undergoes a Phase I oxidation reaction that places an 
epoxide group on the aromatic ring. This process is followed by Phase II conjugation reactions to 
yield products that can be eliminated from the body in the urine.
Exposure to naphthalene can cause anemia and marked reductions in red cell count, hemoglobin, 
and hematocrit in individuals exhibiting genetic susceptibility to these conditions. Naphthalene 
causes skin irritation or severe dermatitis in sensitized individuals. Headaches, confusion, and vom-
iting may result from inhalation or ingestion of naphthalene. Death from kidney failure occurs in 
severe instances of poisoning.
24.4.3.3 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons
Benzo[ a]pyrene (see Section 10.4) is the most studied of the PAHs. Some metabolites of PAH 
compounds, particularly the 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide of benzo[ a]pyrene shown in Figure 24.3, are 
known to cause cancer. There are two stereoisomers of this metabolite, both of which are 
known to be potent mutagens and presumably can cause cancer. They act by forming adducts 
with DNA.CH  +  {O}H

which are characterized by an epoxide  functional group bridging oxygen between two adjacent C 
atoms, are widely used and toxic. Ethylene oxide, a gaseous colorless, sweet-smelling, fl  ammable, 
explosive gas used as a chemical intermediate, sterilant, and fumigant, is moderately to highly toxic, 
a mutagen, and carcinogenic to experimental animals. Inhalation of relatively low levels of this gas 
results in respiratory tract irritation, headache, drowsiness, and dyspnea, whereas exposure to higher 
levels causes cyanosis, pulmonary edema, kidney damage, peripheral nerve damage, and even death. 
Propylene oxide is a colorless, reactive, volatile liquid (bp 34°C) with uses similar to those of ethylene 
oxide and similar, though less severe, toxic effects. The toxicity of 1,2,3,4-butadiene epoxide, the 
oxidation product of 1,3-butadiene, is notable in that it is a direct-acting (primary) carcinogen.
24.4.4.2 Alcohols
Human exposure to the three light alcohols shown in Figure 24.4 is common because they are 
widely used industrially and in consumer products.
Methanol, which has caused many fatalities when ingested accidentally or consumed as a substitute 
for beverage ethanol, is metabolically oxidized to formaldehyde and formic acid. In addition to causing 
acidosis, these products affect the central nervous system and the optic nerve. Acute exposure to lethal 
doses causes an initially mild inebriation, followed in about 10–20 h by unconsciousness, cardiac 
depression, and death. Sublethal exposures can cause blindness from deterioration of the optic nerve 
and retinal ganglion cells. Inhalation of methanol fumes may result in chronic, low-level exposure.
Ethanol is usually ingested through the gastrointestinal tract, but can be absorbed as vapor by 
the alveoli of the lungs. Ethanol is oxidized metabolically more rapidly than methanol, fi  rst to acet-
aldehyde (discussed later in this section), then to CO2. Ethanol has numerous acute effects resulting 
from central nervous system depression. These range from decreased inhibitions and slowed reac-
tion times at 0.05% blood ethanol, through intoxication, stupor, and—at more than 0.5% blood 
 ethanol—death. Ethanol also has a number of chronic effects, of which the addictive condition of 
alcoholism and cirrhosis of the liver are the most prominent.
Despite its widespread use in automobile cooling systems, exposure to ethylene glycol is limited by 
its low vapor pressure. However, inhalation of droplets of ethylene glycol can be very dangerous. In the 
body, ethylene glycol initially stimulates the central nervous system, then depresses it. Glycolic acid, 
chemical formula HOCH2CO2H, formed as an intermediate metabolite in the metabolism of ethylene 
glycol, may cause acidemia, and oxalic acid produced by further oxidation may precipitate in the kid-
neys as solid calcium oxalate, CaC2O4, causing clogging.

Of the higher alcohols, 1-butanol is an irritant, but its toxicity is limited by its low vapor pressure. 
Unsaturated (alkenyl) allyl alcohol, CH2=CHCH2OH, has a pungent odor and is strongly irritating 
to the eyes, mouth, and lungs.
24.4.5 P HENOLS
Figure 24.5 shows some of the more important phenolic compounds, aryl analogs of alcohols which 
have properties much different from those of the aliphatic and olefi  nic alcohols. Nitro groups (–NO2) 
and halogen atoms (particularly Cl) bonded to the aromatic rings strongly affect the chemical and 
toxicological behavior of phenolic compounds.
Although the fi  rst antiseptic to be used on wounds and in surgery, phenol is a protoplasmic poi-
son that damages all kinds of cells and is alleged to have caused “an astonishing number of poison-
ings” since it came into general use.3 The acute toxicological effects of phenol are largely upon the 
central nervous system and death can occur as soon as one and half hour after exposure. Acute 
poisoning by phenol can cause severe gastrointestinal disturbances, kidney malfunction, circulatory 
system failure, lung edema, and convulsions. Fatal doses of phenol may be absorbed through the 
skin. Key organs damaged by chronic phenol exposure include the spleen, pancreas, and kidneys. 
The toxic effects of other phenols resemble those of phenol.
24.4.5.1 Aldehydes and Ketones
Some of the more common carbonyl compounds (aldehydes and ketones) are shown in Figure 24.6. 
Because of their widespread use, these compounds are toxicologically signifi  cant.
Formaldehyde  is uniquely important because of its widespread use and toxicity. In the pure form, 
formaldehyde is a colorless gas with a pungent, suffocating odor. It is commonly encountered as 
formalin , a 37–50% aqueous solution of formaldehyde containing some methanol. Exposure to 
inhaled formaldehyde via the respiratory tract is usually due to molecular formaldehyde vapor, OH CH3 CH3 CH3

FIGURE 24.6 Commercially and toxicologically signifi  cant aldehydes and ketones.662 Environmental Chemistry
whereas exposure by other routes is usually due to formalin. Prolonged, continuous exposure to 
formaldehyde can cause hypersensitivity. A severe irritant to the mucous membrane linings of both 
the respiratory and alimentary tracts, formaldehyde reacts strongly with functional groups in mole-
cules. Formaldehyde has been shown to be a lung carcinogen in experimental animals. The toxicity 
of formaldehyde is largely due to its metabolic oxidation product, formic acid (see Section 24.4.5.2).
The lower aldehydes are relatively water-soluble and intensely irritating. These compounds attack 
exposed moist tissue, particularly the eyes and mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract. 
(Some of the irritating properties of photochemical smog, Chapter 13, are due to the presence of 
aldehydes.) However, aldehydes that are relatively less soluble can penetrate further into the respira-
tory tract and affect the lungs. Colorless, liquid acetaldehyde is relatively less toxic than acrolein 
and acts as an irritant and systemically as a narcotic to the central nervous system. Extremely irritat-
ing, lachrimating acrolein vapor has a choking odor and inhalation of it can cause severe damage to 
respiratory tract membranes. Tissue exposed to acrolein may undergo severe necrosis, and direct 
contact with the eye can be especially hazardous.
The ketones shown in Figure 24.6 are relatively less toxic than the aldehydes. Pleasant-smelling 
acetone can act as a narcotic; it causes dermatitis by dissolving fats from skin. Not many toxic 
effects have been attributed to methyl ethyl ketone. It is suspected of having caused neuropathic 
disorders in shoe factory workers.
24.4.5.2 Carboxylic Acids
Formic acid, HCO2H, is a relatively strong acid that is corrosive to tissue. In Europe, decalcifi  er 
formulations for removing mineral scale that contain about 75% formic acid are sold; and children 
ingesting these solutions have suffered corrosive lesions to the mouth and esophageal tissue. 
Although acetic acid as a 4–6% solution in vinegar is an ingredient of many foods, pure acetic acid 
(glacial acetic acid) is extremely corrosive to the tissue that it contacts. Ingestion of or skin contact 
with acrylic acid can cause severe damage to tissues.
24.4.5.3 Ethers
The common ethers have relatively low toxicities because of the low reactivity of the C–O–C func-
tional group which has very strong carbon–oxygen bonds. Exposure to volatile diethyl ether is usu-
a l ly by i n ha lat ion a nd about 80% of t h is compou nd t hat get s i nto t he bo dy is el i m i nat e d u n met abol i ze d 
as the vapor through the lungs. Diethyl ether depresses the central nervous system and is a depres-
sant widely used as an anesthetic for surgery. Low doses of diethyl ether cause drowsiness, intoxica-
tion, and stupor, whereas higher exposures cause unconsciousness and even death.
24.4.5.4 Acid Anhydrides

is a systemic poison. It is very corrosive to the skin, eyes, and upper respiratory tract, causing blis-
ters and burns that heal only slowly. Levels in the air should not exceed 0.04 mg/m3 and adverse 
effects to the eyes can occur at about 0.4 mg/m3.
24.4.5.5 Esters
Many esters (Figure 24.7) have relatively high volatilities so that the pulmonary system is a major 
route of exposure. Because of their generally good solvent properties, esters penetrate tissues and 
tend to dissolve body lipids. For example, vinyl acetate acts as a skin defatting agent. Because they 
hydrolyze in water, ester toxicities tend to be the same as the toxicities of the acids and alcohols Toxicological Chemistry of Chemical Substances 663
from which they were formed. Many volatile esters exhibit asphyxiant and narcotic action. Whereas 
many of the naturally occurring esters have insignifi  cant toxicities at low doses, allyl acetate and 
some of the other synthetic esters are relatively toxic.
Insofar as potential health effects are concerned, di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is arguably 
the ester of most concern. This is because of the use of this ester at levels of around 30% as a plas-
ticizer to impart fl  exibility to PVC plastic. As a consequence of the widespread use of DEHP-
containing PVC plastics, DEHP has become a ubiquitous contaminant found in water, sediment, 
food, and biological samples. There has been concern about its use in medical applications such as 
in bags used to hold intravenous solutions administered to medical patients. Although the acute 
toxic effects of DEHP are low, widespread direct exposure of humans is worrisome.
24.4.6 O RGANONITROGEN  COMPOUNDS
Organonitrogen compounds constitute a large group of compounds with diverse toxicities. Examples 
of several of the kinds of organonitrogen compounds discussed here are given in Figure 24.8.
24.4.6.1 Aliphatic Amines
The lower amines, such as the methylamines, are rapidly and easily taken into the body by all com-
mon exposure routes. They are basic and react with water in tissue,

thereby raising the pH of the tissue to harmful levels, acting as corrosive poisons (especially to 
sensitive eye tissue), and causing tissue necrosis at the point of contact. Among the systemic 
effects of amines are necrosis of the liver and kidneys, lung hemorrhage and edema, and sensiti-
zation of the immune system. The lower amines are among the more toxic substances in routine, 
large-scale use.
Ethylenediamine is the most common of the alkyl polyamines , compounds in which two or more 
amino groups are bonded to alkane moieties. Its toxicity rating is only 3, but it is a strong skin sen-
sitizer and can damage eye tissue.
24.4.6.2 Carbocyclic Aromatic Amines
Aniline  is a widely used industrial chemical and is the simplest of the carbocyclic  aromatic amines , 
a class of compounds in which at least one substituent group is an aromatic hydrocarbon ring bonded 
directly to the amino group. There are numerous compounds with many industrial uses in this class 
of amines. Some of the carbocyclic aromatic amines have been shown to cause cancer in the human 
bladder, ureter, and pelvis, and are suspected of being lung, liver, and prostate carcinogens. A very 
toxic colorless liquid with an oily consistency and distinct odor, aniline readily enters the body by 
inhalation, ingestion, and through the skin. Metabolically, aniline converts iron(II) in hemoglobin 
to iron(III). This causes a condition called methemoglobinemia , characterized by cyanosis and a 
brown-black color of the blood, in which the hemoglobin can no longer transport oxygen in the 
body. This condition is not reversed by oxygen therapy.
Both 1-naphthylamine  (a-naphthylamine) and  2-naphthylamine  (b-naphthylamine) are proven 
human bladder carcinogens. In addition to being a proven human carcinogen, benzidine , 4,4 ¢-
diaminobiphenyl, is highly toxic and has systemic effects that include blood hemolysis, bone mar-
row depression, and kidney and liver damage. It can be taken into the body orally, by inhalation into 
the lungs, and by skin sorption.
24.4.6.3 Pyridine
Pyridine , a colorless liquid with a sharp, penetrating, “terrible” odor, is an aromatic amine in which 
an N atom is part of a 6-membered ring. This widely used industrial chemical is only moderately 
toxic with a toxicity rating of 3. Symptoms of pyridine poisoning include anorexia, nausea, fatigue, 
and, in cases of chronic poisoning, mental depression. In a few rare cases, pyridine poisoning has 
been fatal.
24.4.6.4 Acrylamide: Toxic Potato Chips?
In 2002, Swedish investigators reported fi  nding potentially harmful amounts of acrylamide in fried 
and baked foods, but not in boiled foods. Acrylamide is known to be a neurotoxin and is a carcino-
gen to rats and possibly to humans as well. The formation of acrylamide has been shown to occur 
when glucose and the amino acid asparagine are heated together to temperatures exceeding 120°C. 
The reaction sequence below, known as the Maillard reaction, results in the formation of acrylamide 
from glucose and asparagine:

24.4.6.5 Nitriles
Nitriles  contain the –C ∫N functional group. Colorless, liquid acetonitrile , CH3CN, is widely used 
in the chemical industry . With a to xicity rating of 3–4, acetonitrile is considered relativ ely safe, 
although it has caused human deaths, perhaps by metabolic release of cyanide. Acrylonitrile , a 
 colorless liquid with a peach-seed (cyanide) odor, is highly reactive because it contains both nitrile 
and C =C groups. Ingested, absorbed through the skin, or inhaled as vapor, acrylonitrile metabolizes 
to release deadly HCN, which it resembles toxicologically.
24.4.6.6 Nitro Compounds
The simplest of the nitro compounds, nitromethane  H3CNO2, is an oily liquid that causes anorexia, 
diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting and damages the kidneys and liver. Nitrobenzene , a pale yellow, oily 
liquid with an odor of bitter almonds or shoe polish, can enter the body by all routes. It has a toxic 
acti o n m u c h lik e that o f aniline , co n v ertin g he m o gl o b in to me the m o gl o b in, w hi c h cann ot carry 
oxygen to body tissue. Nitrobenzene poisoning is manifested by cyanosis. 
24.4.6.7 Nitrosamines
N-nitroso  compounds ( nitrosamines ) contain the N –N=O functional group and have been found in 
a variety of materials to which humans may be exposed, including beer, whiskey, and cutting oils 
used in machining. Cancer may result from exposure to a single large dose or from chronic exposure 
to relatively small doses of some nitrosamines. Once widely used as an industrial solvent and known 
to cause liver damage and jaundice in exposed workers, dimethylnitrosamine was shown to be car-
cinogenic from studies starting in the 1950s.

24.4.6.8 Isocyanates and Methyl Isocyanate
Compounds with the general formula R –N=C=O, isocyanates  are widely used industrial chemi-
cals noted for the high chemical and metabolic reactivity of their characteristic functional group. 
Methyl isocyanate , H3C–N=C=O, was the toxic agent involved in the catastrophic industrial poi-
soning in Bhopal, India, on December 2, 1984, the worst industrial accident in history . In this 
incident, several tons of methyl isocyanate were released, killing 2000 people and affecting about 
100,000. The lungs of victims were attacked; survivors suffered long-term shortness of breath 
and weakness from lung damage, as well as numerous other toxic effects including nausea and 
bodily pain.
24.4.6.9 Organonitrogen Pesticides
Pesticidal carbamates  are characterized by the structural skeleton of carbamic acid outlined by the 
dashed box in the structural formula of carbaryl in Figure 24.9. Widely used on lawns and gardens, 
insecticidal carbaryl  has a low toxicity to mammals. Highly water-soluble carbofuran  is a systemic 
insecticide in that it is taken up by the roots and leaves of plants; insects that feed on the leaves are 
poisoned. The toxic effects on animals exposed to carbamates are due to the fact that they inhibit 
acetylcholinesterase directly without the need to fi  rst undergo biotransformation. This effect is rela-
tively reversible because of metabolic hydrolysis of the carbamate ester.
Reputed to have “been responsible for hundreds of human deaths,”4 herbicidal paraquat  has a 
toxicity rating of 5. Dangerous or even fatal acute exposures can occur by inhalation of spray, skin 
contact, and ingestion. Paraquat is a systemic poison that affects enzyme activity and is devastating 
to a number of organs. Pulmonary fi  brosis results in animals that have inhaled paraquat aerosols, 666 Environmental Chemistry
and the lungs are also adversely affected by nonpulmonary exposure. Acute exposure may cause 
variations in the levels of catecholamine, glucose, and insulin. The most prominent initial symptom 
of poisoning is vomiting, followed within a few days by dyspnea, cyanosis, and evidence of impair-
ment of the kidneys, liver, and heart. Pulmonary fi  brosis, often accompanied by pulmonary edema 
and hemorrhaging, is observed in fatal cases.
Arguably the most widely encountered organonitrogen herbicide is atrazine , the structural for-
mula of which is shown in Figure 7.12.5 This compound is frequently encountered in drinking water 
supplies, especially in agricultural areas.
24.4.7 O RGANOHALIDE  COMPOUNDS
Because of their persistence and tendency to accumulate in lipid tissues, the ecotoxicology of 
organohalide compounds is quite important. Their occurrence in the environment has become less 
prevalent as their manufacture has been curtailed for environmental reasons. An interesting aspect 
of these compounds is their occurrence in human mothers’ milk, which can be analyzed for envi-
ronmental exposure to them.6
24.4.7.1 Alkyl Halides
The toxicities of alkyl halides, such as carbon tetrachloride, CCl4, vary a great deal with the com-
pound. Most of these compounds cause depression of the central nervous system, and individual 
compounds exhibit specifi  c toxic effects.
Carbon tetrachloride was once widely available in general merchandise stores as a product to 
remove grease stains from clothing. It was also sold sealed in baseball-sized spherical glass contain-
ers that could be hurled at kitchen fi  res to extinguish the fl  ames. During many years of its use as a 
consumer product, carbon tetrachloride compiled a grim record of toxic effects which led the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prohibit its household use in 1970. It is a systemic 
poison that affects the nervous system when inhaled, and the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kid-
neys when ingested. The biochemical mechanism of carbon tetrachloride toxicity involves reactive 
radical species, including the following,

that react with biomolecules, such as proteins and DNA. The most damaging such reaction occurs 
in the liver as lipid peroxidation , consisting of the attack of free radicals on unsaturated lipid mol-
ecules, followed by oxidation of the lipids through a free radical mechanism.H

24.4.7.2 Alkenyl Halides
The most signifi  cant alkenyl  or olefi  nic organohalides  are the lighter chlorinated compounds, such 
as vinyl chloride and tetrachloroethylene:

C C C C 
Cl Cl Cl 
Cl Cl H 
H 
Vinyl chloride Tetrachloroeth ylene 
Because of their widespread use and disposal in the environment, the numerous acute and chronic 
toxic effects of the alkenyl halides are of considerable concern.
The central nervous system, respiratory system, liver, and blood and lymph systems are all 
affected by vinyl chloride exposure, which has been widespread because of this compound’s use in 
polyvinylchloride manufacture. Most notably, vinyl chloride is carcinogenic, causing a rare angiosar-
coma of the liver. This deadly form of cancer has been observed in workers chronically exposed to 
vinyl chloride while cleaning autoclaves in the polyvinylchloride fabrication industry. The alkenyl 
organohalide, 1,1-dichloroethylene, is a suspect human carcinogen based upon animal studies and 
its structural similarity to vinyl chloride. The toxicities of both 1,2-dichloroethylene isomers are 
relatively low. These compounds act in different ways in that the cis isomer is an irritant and nar-
cotic, whereas the trans  isomer affects both the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal 
tract, causing weakness, tremors, cramps, and nausea. A suspect human carcinogen, trichloroethyl-
ene has caused liver carcinoma in experimental animals and is known to affect numerous body 
organs. Like other organohalide solvents, trichloroethylene causes skin dermatitis from dissolution 
of skin lipids, and it can affect the central nervous and respiratory systems, liver, kidneys, and heart. 
Symptoms of exposure include disturbed vision, headaches, nausea, cardiac arrhythmias, and burn-
ing/tingling sensations in the nerves (paresthesia).
Tetrachloroethylene damages the liver, kidneys, and central nervous system. It is a suspect human 
carcinogen. It is metabolically oxidized to tetrachloroethylene oxide,

 (24.8)
which is probably the reactive intermediate reponsible for its toxicity. The tetrachloroethylene oxide 
intermediate is further metabolized to trichloroacetic acid, Cl3CO2H, and other products.
24.4.7.3 Aryl Halides
Individuals exposed to irritant monochlorobenzene by inhalation or skin contact suffer symptoms 
to the respiratory system, liver, skin, and eyes. Ingestion of this compound causes effects similar to 
those of toxic aniline, including incoordination, pallor, cyanosis, and eventual collapse. 
The dichlorobenzenes are irritants that affect the same organs as monochlorobenzene. Some 
animal tests have suggested that 1,2-dichlorobenzene is a potential cancer-causing substance. 
 Para -dichlorobenzene (1,4-dichlorobenzene), a chemical used in air fresheners and mothballs, has 
been known to cause profuse rhinitis (running nose), nausea, jaundice, liver cirrhosis, and weight 
loss associated with anorexia. It is not known to be a carcinogen. Its major urinary metabolite is 
2,5-dichlorophenol, which is eliminated principally as the glucuronide or sulfate.
Because of their once widespread use in electrical equipment, as hydraulic fl  uids, and in many 
other applications, PCBs (see Section 7.12) became widespread, extremely persistent environmental 
pollutants. PCBs have a strong tendency to undergo bioaccumulation in lipid tissue. Polybrominated 
biphenyl analogs (PBBs) were much less widely used and distributed. However, PBBs were involved 668 Environmental Chemistry
in one major incident that resulted in catastrophic agricultural losses when livestock feed 
 contaminated with PBB fl  ame retardant caused massive livestock poisoning in Michigan in 1973.
The greatest current concerns with brominated compounds are centered around brominated 
fi re retardants. These are primarily pentabromo, octabromo, and decabromodiphenyl ethers (see 
below):
 Br 
Br Br Br 
O Br

Decabromodiphenyl ether

They are very persistent pollutants and, although their toxicities to humans are not well established, 
environmental exposure to them is a matter of some concern. Unfortunately, effective substitutes for 
these compounds as fi  re retardants are lacking. Tightened standards for polybrominated compounds 
by the EU are causing concerns among electrical and electronic manufacturers who must comply 
with more stringent fi  reproofi  ng standards in the face of expected phaseout of polybrominated fi  re 
retardants.
24.4.8 O RGANOHALIDE  PESTICIDES
Exhibiting a wide range of kind and degree of toxic effects, many organohalide insecticides (see 
Section 7.11) affect the central nervous system, causing tremor, irregular eye jerking, changes in 
personality, and loss of memory. Such symptoms are characteristic of acute DDT poisoning. 
However, the acute toxicity of DDT to humans is very low and, when used for the control of 
typhus and malaria in World War II, it was applied directly to people. The chlorinated cyclodiene 
insecticides—aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, chlordane, heptachlor, endosulfan, and isodrin—act on the 
brain, releasing betaine esters and causing headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, jerking mus-
cles, and convulsions. Dieldrin, chlordane, and heptachlor have caused liver cancer in test ani-
mals, and some chlorinated cyclodiene insecticides are teratogenic or fetotoxic. Because of these 
effects, aldrin, dieldrin, heptachlor, and chlordane have been prohibited from use in the United 
States.
The major chlorophenoxy  herbicides are 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 2,4,5-trichloro-
phenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T or Agent Orange, now banned), and Silvex. Large doses of 2,4-dichloro-
phenoxyacetic acid have been shown to cause nerve damage, (peripheral neuropathy), convulsions, 
and brain damage. With a toxicity somewhat less than that of 2,4-D, Silvex is largely excreted 
unchanged in the urine. The toxic effects of 2,4,5-T (used as a herbicidal warfare chemical called 
“ Agent Orange”) ha v e resulted from the presence of TCDD ( commonly kno wn as “ dio xin, ” dis-
cussed below), a manufacturing by-product. Autopsied carcasses of sheep poisoned by this herbi-
cide have exhibited nephritis, hepatitis, and enteritis. 
24.4.8.1 TCDD
Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins  are compounds which have the same basic structure as that of TCDD, 
 O Cl
TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-
dibenzo-p-dioxin)Cl
Cl Cl O
but have different numbers and locations of chlorine atoms on the ring structure. Extremely toxic to 
some animals, the toxicity of TCDD to humans is rather uncertain; it is known to cause a skin condi-
tion called chloracne. TCDD has been a manufacturing by-product of some commercial products (see 
the discussion of 2,4,5-T, above), a contaminant identifi  ed in some municipal incineration emissions, Toxicological Chemistry of Chemical Substances 669
and a widespread environmental pollutant from improper waste disposal. This compound has been 
released in a number of industrial accidents, the most massive of which exposed several tens of thou-
sands of people to a cloud of chemical emissions spread over an approximately 3-square-mile area at 
the Givaudan-La Roche Icmesa manufacturing plant near Seveso, Italy, in 1976. On an encouraging 
note from a toxicological perspective, no abnormal occurrences of major malformations were found in 
a study of several thousand children born in the area within 6 years after the release.
24.4.8.2 Chlorinated Phenols
The chlorinated phenols used in largest quantities have been pentachlorophenol (Chapter 7) and the 
trichlorophenol isomers used as wood preservatives. Although exposure to these compounds has 
been correlated with liver malfunction and dermatitis, contaminant polychlorinated dibenzodioxins 
may have caused some of the observed effects.
24.4.9 O RGANOSULFUR  COMPOUNDS
Despite the high toxicity of H2S, not all organosulfur compounds are particularly toxic. Their 
 hazards are often reduced by their strong, offensive odors that warn of their presence.
Inhalation of even very low concentrations of the alkyl thiols , such as methanethiol, H3CSH, can 
cause nausea and headaches; higher levels can cause increased pulse rate, cold hands and feet, and 
cyanosis. In extreme cases, unconsciousness, coma, and death occur. Like H2S, the alkyl thiols are 
precursors to cytochrome oxidase poisons.
An oily, water-soluble liquid, methylsulfuric acid  is a strong irritant to the skin, eyes, and mucous 
tissue. Colorless, odorless dimethyl sulfate  is highly toxic and is a primary carcinogen that does not 
require bioactivation to cause cancer. Skin or mucous membranes exposed to dimethyl sulfate 
develop conjunctivitis and infl  ammation of nasal tissue and respiratory tract mucous membranes 
following an initial latent period during which few symptoms are observed. Damage to the liver and 
kidneys, pulmonary edema, cloudiness of the cornea, and death within 3–4 days can result from 
heavier exposures.

24.4.9.1 Sulfur Mustards
A typical example of deadly sulfur mustards , compounds used as military poisons or “poison 
gases,” is mustard oil [bis(2-chloroethyl)sulfi  de]:
 Cl Cl Mustard oil CCH
HH HHHH H
CC S
An experimental mutagen and primary carcinogen, mustard oil produces vapors that penetrate deep 
within tissue, resulting in destruction and damage at some depth from the point of contact; penetra-
tion is very rapid, so that efforts to remove the toxic agent from the exposed area are ineffective after 
30 min. This military “blistering gas” poison causes tissue to become severely infl  amed with lesions 
that often become infected. These lesions in the lung can cause death.670 Environmental Chemistry
24.4.10 O RGANOPHOSPHORUS  COMPOUNDS
Organophosphorus compounds have varying degrees of toxicity. Some of these compounds, such as 
the “nerve gases” produced as industrial poisons, are deadly in minute quantities. The toxicities of 
major classes of organophosphate compounds are discussed in this section.
24.4.10.1 Organophosphate Esters
Some organophosphate esters are shown in Figure 24.10. Trimethyl phosphate  is probably moder-
ately toxic when ingested or absorbed through the skin, whereas moderately toxic triethyl phos-
phate , (C2H5O)3PO, damages nerves and inhibits acetylcholinesterase. Notoriously toxic tri-o-cresyl 
phosphate  (TOCP) apparently is metabolized to products that inhibit acetylcholinesterase. Exposure 
to TOCP causes degeneration of the neurons in the body’s central and peripheral nervous systems 
with early symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea accompanied by severe abdominal pain. 
About 1–3 weeks after these symptoms have subsided, peripheral paralysis develops manifested by 
“wrist drop” and “foot drop,” followed by slow recovery, which may be complete or leave a perma-
nent partial paralysis, whereas the toxic effects of tetraethyl pyrophosphate (TEPP) or paraoxon 
develop much more rapidly. Humans poisoned by parathion exhibit skin twitching and respiratory 
distress. In fatal cases, respiratory failure occurs due to central nervous system paralysis.
Briefl  y used in Germany as a substitute for insecticidal nicotine,  TEPP is a very potent acetylcho-
linesterase inhibi tor . Wi th a to xici ty rating of 6 ( superto xic ) , TEPP is deadl y to humans and other 
mammals.
24.4.10.2 Phosphorothionate and Phosphorodithioate Ester Insecticides
Because esters containing the P =S (thiono) group are resistant to nonenzymatic hydrolysis and are 
not as effective as P =O compounds in inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, they exhibit higher 
insect:mammal toxicity ratios than their nonsulfur analogs. Therefore, phosphorothionate  and 
phosphorodithioate  esters (Figure 24. 1 1 ) have been widely used as insecticides. The insecticidal 
activity of these compounds requires metabolic conversion of P =S to P =O (oxidative desulfu ration). 
Environmentally, organophosphate insecticides are superior to many of the organochlorine insecti-
cides because the organophosphates readily undergo biodegradation and do not bioaccumulate.
The fi  rst commercially successful phosphorothionat e/phosphorodithioate ester insecticide was 
parathion , O,O- diethyl- O-p-nitrophenylphosphorothionate, fi  rst licensed for use in 1944. This 
insecticide, which inhibits acetylcholinesterase, has a toxicity rating of 6 (supertoxic). Since its use 
began, several hundred people have been killed by parathion, including 17 of 79 people exposed to

by absorption through the skin. Methylparathion (a closely related compound with methyl groups 
instead of ethyl groups) is regarded as extremely toxic, and it is no longer used. In order for para-
thion to have a toxic effect, it must be converted metabolically to paraoxon (Figure 24.10), which is 
a potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. Because of the time required for this conversion, symp-
toms develop several hours after exposure.
Malathion  is the best known of the phosphorodithioate insecticides. It has a relatively high 
insect:mammal toxicity ratio because of its two carboxyester linkages which are hydrolyzable by 
carboxylase enzymes (possessed by mammals, but not insects) to relatively nontoxic products. For 
example, although malathion is a very effective insecticide, its LD50 for adult male rats is about 100 
times that of parathion.
24.4.10.3 Organophosphorus Military Poisons
Powerful inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase enzyme, organophosphorus “nerve gas” military poisons 
include Sarin  and VX, for which structural formulas are shown below. (The possibility that military 
poisons such as these might be used in war was a major concern during the 1991 Mid-East confl  ict, 
which, fortunately, ended without their being employed. The existence of military poison nerve gas 
was one of the justifi  cations for the 2003 Iraqi war, but these “weapons of mass destruction” were not 
found.) A systemic poison to the central nervous system that is readily absorbed as a liquid through 
the skin, Sarin may be lethal at doses as low as about 0.0l mg/kg; a single drop can kill a human.

24.5 TOXIC NATURAL PRODUCTS
Nature produces a wide variety of toxic substances. People can ingest toxic natural products in a 
variety of forms and food can be a source of mutagens that can be cancer-suspect agents. One of the

bacteria. (Despite its extreme toxicity, botulinum toxin has a number of medicinal uses primarily as 
a muscle relaxant; it is the active ingredient in Botox used to treat wrinkles.) A number of organisms 
wage forms of chemical warfare. Venomous serpents produce venoms of various kinds to kill prey 
and for defense.
Food poisoning of various kinds can be caused by ingestion of natural products. One of the most 
severe forms of food poisoning is paralytic shellfi  sh poisoning in which various varieties of shellfi  sh 
accumulate toxins from single-celled dinofl  agellates. These toxins block neuronal transmission and 
can be fatal.
Mycotoxins  are toxic secondary metabolites from fungi that have a wide range of structures and 
a variety of toxic effects. Human and animal exposure to mycotoxins usually result from ingestion 
of food upon which fungal molds have grown. Among the many kinds of molds that produce myco-
toxins are Aspergillus fl  avus , Fusarium , Trichoderma , Aspergillus , and Penicillium . Perhaps the 
most well-known mycotoxins are the afl  atoxins , such as afl  atoxin B1 produced by Aspergillus :

Molds that produce mycotoxins grow on a variety of food products including corn, cereal grains, 
rice, apples, peanuts, and milk. Other mycotoxins include ergot alkaloids, ochratoxins, fumonisins, 
trichothecenes, tremorgenic toxins, satratoxin, zearalenone, and vomitotoxin.

Water and Wastewater
25.1 GENERAL ASPECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ANALYSIS
Scientists’ understanding of the environment can only be as good as their knowledge of the  identities 
and quantities of pollutants and other chemical species in water, air, soil, and biological systems. 
Therefore, proven, state-of-the-art techniques of chemical analysis, properly employed, are essen-
tial to environmental chemistry. The present time is a very exciting period in the evolution of ana-
lytical chemistry, characterized by the development of new and improved analysis techniques that 
enable detection of much lower levels of chemical species and a vastly increased data throughput. 
These developments pose some challenges. Because of the lower detection limits of some instru-
ments, it is now possible to see quantities of pollutants that would have escaped detection previously, 
resulting in diffi  cult questions regarding the setting of maximum allowable limits of various pollut-
ants. The increased output of data from automated instruments has in many cases overwhelmed 
human capacity to assimilate and understand it.
Challenging problems still remain in developing and utilizing techniques of environmental 
chemical analysis. Not the least of these problems is knowing which species should be measured, or 
even whether or not an analysis should be performed at all. The quality and choice of analyses is 
much more important than the number of analyses performed. Indeed, a persuasive argument can 
be made that, given modern capabilities in analytical chemistry, too many analyses of environmen-
tal samples are performed, whereas fewer, more carefully planned analyses would yield more useful 
information.
In addition to a discussion of water analysis, this chapter covers some of the general aspects of 
environmental chemical analysis and the major techniques that are used to determine a wide range 
o f anal ytes ( s peci es meas ured ) . Man y tec hni q u es are co mm o n to w ater , air , so il, an d b i o l o gi cal 
sample analyses, and reference is made to them in chapters that follow.
25.1.1 E RROR AND QUALITY  CONTROL
A crucial aspect of any chemical analysis is the validity and quality of the data that it produces. All 
measurements are subject to error, which may be systematic  (of the same magnitude and same 
direction) or random  (varying in both magnitude and direction). Systematic errors cause the mea-
sured values to vary consistently from the true values; this variation is known as the bias. The 
degree to which a measured value comes close to the actual value of an analytical measurement is 
called the accuracy  of the measurement, refl  ecting both systematic and random errors. It is essential 
for the analyst to determine these error components in the measurement of environmental samples, 
including water samples. The identifi  cation and control of systematic and random errors falls in the 
category of quality control (QC)  procedures. It is beyond the scope of this chapter to go into any 
detail on these crucial procedures for which the reader is referred to a work on standard methods for 
the analysis of water.1678 Environmental Chemistry
In order for the results from a laboratory to be meaningful, the laboratory needs a quality assur-
ance plan  specifying measures taken to produce data of known quality. An important aspect of such 
a plan is the use of laboratory control standards consisting of samples with very accurately known 
analyte levels in a carefully controlled matrix. Such standard reference materials are available in the 
United States from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for many kinds 
of samples.
Many environmental analytes are present at very low levels, which challenge the ability of the 
method used to detect and accurately quantify them. (Typically, pharmaceuticals and their meta-
bolites are present at nanogram to low-picogram per liter levels in wastewater.) Therefore, the detec-
tion limit  o f  a  m e t h o d  o f  a n a l y s i s  i s  q u i t e  i m p o rt a n t .  D e fi  ning detection limit has long been a 
controversial topic in chemical analysis. Every analytical method has a certain degree of noise. The 
detection limit is an expression of the lowest concentration of analytes that can be measured above 
the noise level with a specifi  ed degree of confi  dence in an analytical procedure. In the detection of 
analytes, two kinds of errors can be defi  ned. A Type I error occurs when the measurement fi  nds an 
analyte present when it is actually absent. A Type II error occurs when the measurement fi  nds an 
analyte absent when it is actually present.
Detection limits can be further categorized into several different subcategories. The instrument 
detection limit (IDL)  is the analyte concentration capable of producing a signal 3 times the standard 
deviation of the noise. The lower level of detection (LLD)  is the quantity of analyte that will produce 
a measurable signal 99% of the time; it is about 2 times the IDL. The method detection limit (MDL ) 
is measured like the LLD, except that the analyte is taken through the whole analytical procedure, 
including steps such as extraction and sample cleanup; it is about 4 times the IDL. Finally, the prac-
tical quantitation limit  (PQL) , which is about 20 times the IDL, is the lowest level achievable in 
routine analysis in laboratories.
25.1.2 W ATER ANALYSIS  METHODS
Methods of analysis are published for a huge number of water constituents and contaminants. It is 
not possible to cover them in a comprehensive manner in one short chapter. For analytical proce-
dures, the reader is referred to sources of methods. The most comprehensive of these is the classic 
Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater .2 The U.S. EPA publishes meth-
ods for water analysis that are listed in an index of methods3 and available from the National 
Technical Information Service.4 Another useful source of methods is available on a CD ROM from 
Genium Publishing Corp.5 Current issues in water analysis are reviewed periodically in the journal 
Analytical Chemistry .6
25.2 CLASSICAL METHODS
Before sophisticated instrumentation became available, most important water quality parameters 
and some air pollutant analyses were done by classical methods , which require only chemicals, bal-
ances to measure masses, burettes, volumetric fl  asks and pipettes to measure volumes, and other 
simple laboratory glassware. The two major classical methods are volumetric analysis , in which 
volumes of reagents are measured, and gravimetric analysis , in which masses are measured. Some 
of these methods are still used today, and many have been adapted to instrumental and automated 
procedures.
The most common classical methods for pollutant analysis are titrations, largely used for water 
analysis. Some of the titration procedures used are discussed in this section.
Acidity  (see Section 3.7) is determined simply by titrating hydrogen ion with base. Titration to the 
methyl orange endpoint (pH 4.5) yields the “free acidity” due to strong acids (HCl and H2SO4). 
Carbon dioxide does not, of course, appear in this category. Titration to the phenolphthalein end-
point (pH 8.3) yields total acidity and accounts for all acids except those weaker than HCO3-. Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastewater 679
Alkalinity  may be determined by titration with H2SO4 to pH 8.3 to neutralize bases as strong as, 
or stronger than, carbonate ion,
 CO32- + H+ Æ HCO3- (25.1)
or by titration to pH 4.5 to neutralize bases weaker than CO32-, but as strong as, or stronger than, 
HCO3-:
 HCO3- + H+ Æ H2O + CO2(g) (25.2)
Titration to the lower pH yields total alkalinity.
The calcium and magnesium ions responsible for water hardness are readily titrated at pH 10 with 
a solution of EDTA, a chelating agent discussed in Sections 3.10 and 3.13. The titration reaction is
 Ca2+(or Mg2+) + H2Y2- Æ CaY2-(or MgY2-) +  2H+ (25.3)
where H2Y2- is the partially ionized EDTA chelating agent. Eriochrome Black T is used as an indi-
cator, and it requires the presence of magnesium, with which it forms a wine red complex.
Several oxidation–reduction titrations can be used for environmental chemical analysis. Oxygen 
is determined in water by the Winkler titration. The fi  rst reaction in the Winkler method is the oxi-
dation of manganese(II) to manganese(IV) by the oxygen analyte in a basic medium; this reaction 
is followed by acidifi  cation of the brown hydrated MnO2 in the presence of I- ion to release free I2, 
and then titration of the liberated iodine with standard thiosulfate, using starch as an endpoint 
indicator:
 Mn2+ + 2OH- +   1 __ 2  O2 Æ MnO2(s) + H2O (25.4)
 MnO2(s) + 2I- + 4H+ Æ Mn2+ + I2 + 2H2O (25.5)
 I2 + 2S2O32- Æ S4O62- + 2I- (25.6)
A back-calculation from the amount of thiosulfate required yields the original quantity of dis-
solved oxygen (DO) present. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) (see Section 7.9), is determined by 
adding a microbial “seed” to the diluted sample, saturating with air, incubating for fi  ve days, and 
determining the oxygen remaining. The results are calculated to show BOD as mg/L of O2. A BOD 
of 80 mg/L, for example, means that biodegradation of the organic matter in a liter of the sample 
would consume 80 mg of oxygen.
25.3 SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC METHODS
25.3.1 A BSORPTION  SPECTROPHOTOMETRY
Absorption spectrophotometry of light-absorbing species in solution, historically called colorimetry 
when visible light is absorbed, is still used for the analysis of some water and air pollutants. Basically, 
absorption spectrophotometry consists of measuring the percent transmittance (%T) of monochro-
matic light passing through a light-absorbing solution as compared to the amount of light passing 
through a blank solution containing everything in the medium but the sought-for constituent (100%). 
The absorbance ( A) is defi  ned as
 A = log  100 ____ %T   (25.7)
The relationship between A and the concentration ( C) of the absorbing substance is given by 
Beer’s law:
 A  = abC (25.8)680 Environmental Chemistry
where a is the absorptivity, a wavelength-dependent parameter characteristic of the absorbing 
 substance; b is the path length of the light through the absorbing solution; and C is the concentration 
of the absorbing substance. A linear relationship between A and C at constant path length indicates 
adherence to Beer’s law. In many cases, analyses may be performed even when Beer’s law is 
not obeyed, if a suitable calibration curve is prepared. A color-developing step is usually required in 
which the sought-for substance reacts to form a colored species, and in some cases a colored species 
is extracted into a nonaqueous solvent to provide a more intense color and a more concentrated 
solution.
A number of solution spectrophotometric methods have been used for the determination of water 
and air pollutants. Some of these are summarized in Table 25.1.
25.3.2 A TOMIC  ABSORPTION  AND EMISSION  ANALYSES

samples. This technique is based on the absorption of monochromatic light by a cloud of atoms of 
the analyte metal. The monochromatic light can be produced by a source composed of the same 
atoms as those being analyzed. The source produces intense electromagnetic radiation with a 
 wavelength exactly the same as that absorbed by the atoms, resulting in extremely high selectivity. 
The basic components of an atomic absorption instrument are shown in Figure 25.1. The key element 
is the hollow cathode lamp in which atoms of the analyte metal are energized such that they become 
electronically excited and emit radiation with a very narrow wavelength band  characteristic of the

metal. This radiation is guided by the appropriate optics through a fl  ame into which the sample is 
aspirated. In the fl  ame, most metallic compounds are decomposed, and the metal is reduced to the 
elemental state, forming a cloud of atoms. These atoms absorb a fraction of radiation in the fl  ame. 
The fraction of radiation absorbed increases with the concentration of the sought-for element in the 
sample according to the Beer’s law relationship (Equation 25.8). The attenuated light beam next goes 
to a monochromator to eliminate extraneous light resulting from the fl  ame, and then to a detector.
Atomizers other than a fl  ame can be used. The most common of these is the graphite furnace, an 
electrothermal atomization device that consists of a hollow graphite cylinder placed so that the light 
beam passes through it. A small sample of up to 100 mL is inserted through a hole on the upper side 
of the horizontally oriented tube. An electric current is passed through the tube to heat it— 
gradually at fi  rst to dry the sample, then rapidly to vaporize and excite the metal analyte. The 
absorption of metal atoms in the hollow portion of the tube is measured and recorded as a spike-
shaped signal. A diagram of a graphite furnace with a typical output signal is shown in Figure 25.2. 
The major advantage of the graphite furnace is that it gives detection limits up to 1000 times lower 
than those of conventional fl  ame devices.

A special technique for the fl  ameless atomic absorption analysis of mercury involves room 
 temperature reduction of mercury to the elemental state by tin(II) chloride in solution, followed 
by sweeping the mercury into an absorption cell with air. Nanogram (10-9 g) quantities of mercury 
can be determined by measuring mercury absorption at 253.7 nm.
25.3.3 A TOMIC  EMISSION  TECHNIQUES
Metals may be determined in water, atmospheric particulate matter, and biological samples very 
well by observing the spectral lines emitted when they are heated to a very high temperature. An 
especially useful atomic emission technique is inductively coupled with plasma atomic emission 
spectroscopy (ICP/AES). The “fl  ame” in which analyte atoms are excited in plasma emission con-
sists of an incandescent plasma (ionized gas) of argon heated inductively by radiofrequency energy 
at 4–50 MHz and 2–5 kW (Figure 25.3). The energy is transferred to a stream of argon through an 
induction coil, producing temperatures up to 10,000 K. The sample atoms are subjected to tempera-
tures around 7000 K, twice those of the hottest conventional fl  ames (e.g., nitrous oxide–acetylene 
operates at 3200 K). Since emission of light increases exponentially with temperature, lower 
 detection limits are obtained. Furthermore, the technique enables emission analysis of some of the 
environmentally important metalloids such as arsenic, boron, and selenium. Interfering chemical 
reactions and interactions in the plasma are minimized as compared to fl  ames. Of greatest 
 signifi  cance, however, is the capability of analyzing as many as 30 elements simultaneously, enabling

 measuring electrode and that of a reference electrode is a function of the log of the activity of an ion 
in solution. For a measuring electrode responding selectively to a particular ion, this relationship is 
given by the Nernst equation,
 E = E0 +   2.303 RT ________  zF   log(az) (25.9)
where E is the measured potential; E0 is the standard electrode potential; R is the gas constant; T is 
the absolute temperature; z is the signed charge ( + for cations, - for anions); F is the Faraday con-
stant; and a is the activity of the ion being measured. At a given temperature, the quantity 2.303 RT/F 
has a constant value; at 25°C, it is 0.0592 V (59.2 mV). At constant ionic strength, the activity, a, is 
directly proportional to concentration, and the Nernst equation for electrodes responding to Cd2+ 
and F  - may be written as 
 E (in mV)  = E0 +   59.2 ____ 2   log[Cd2+] (25.10)
 E = E0 - 59.2 log[F-] (25.11)
Electrodes that respond more or less selectively to various ions are called ion-selective elec-
trodes . Generally, the potential-developing component is a membrane of some kind that allows for 
selective exchange of the sought-for ion. The glass electrode used for the measurement of hydrogen-
ion activity and pH is the oldest and most widely used ion-selective electrode. The potential is 
developed at a glass membrane that selectively exchanges hydrogen ion in preference to other cat-
ions, giving a Nernstian response to hydrogen ion activity, aH+:
 E = E0 + 59.2 log(aH+), E = E0 - 59.2 pH (25.12)
The pH meters used with glass electrodes are calibrated directly in pH units using standard buf-
fer solutions.
Of the ion-selective electrodes other than glass electrodes, the fl  uoride electrode is the most suc-
cessful. It is well behaved, relatively free of interferences, and has an adequately low detection limit 
and a long range of linear response. Like all ion-selective electrodes, its electrical output is in the 
form of a potential signal that is proportional to log of concentration. Because of the logarithmic 
response of potential to concentration, small errors in E lead to relatively high concentration errors.
Voltammetric techniques, the measurement of current resulting from potential applied to a 
microelectrode, have found some applications in water analysis. One such technique is differential-
pulse polarography, in which the potential is applied to the microelectrode in the form of small 
pulses superimposed on a linearly increasing potential. The current is read near the end of the volt-
age pulse and compared to the current just before the pulse was applied. It has the advantage of 
minimizing the capacitive current from charging the microelectrode surface, which sometimes 
obscures the current due to the reduction or oxidation of the species being analyzed. Anodic-
stripping voltammetry involves deposition of metals on an electrode surface over a period of several 
minutes followed by stripping them off very rapidly using a linear anodic sweep. The electrodeposi-
tion concentrates the metals on the electrode surface, and increased sensitivity results. An even 
better technique is to strip the metals off using a differential-pulse signal. A differential-pulse 
anodic-stripping voltammogram of copper, lead, cadmium, and zinc in tap water is shown in 
Figure 25.4.
25.5 CHROMATOGRAPHY
First described in the literature in the early 1950s, gas chromatography (GC) has played an essential 
role in the analysis of organic materials. GC is both a qualitative and a quantitative technique; for 684 Environmental Chemistry
some analytical applications of environmental importance, it is remarkably sensitive and selective. 
GC is based on the principle that when a mixture of volatile materials transported by a carrier gas 
is passed through a column containing an adsorbent solid phase or, more commonly, an absorbing 
liquid phase coated on a solid material, each volatile component will be partitioned between the 
carrier gas and the solid or liquid. The length of time required for the volatile component to traverse 
the column is proportional to the degree to which it is retained by the nongaseous phase. Since dif-
ferent components may be retained to different degrees, they will emerge from the end of the col-
umn at different times. If a suitable detector is available, the time at which the component emerges 
from the column and the quantity of the component are both measured. A recorder trace of the 
detector response appears as peaks of different sizes, depending on the quantity of material pro-
ducing the detector response. Both quantitative and (within limits) qualitative analyses of the sought-
for substances are obtained.
The essential features of a gas chromatograph are shown schematically in Figure 25.5. The car-
rier gas generally is argon, helium, hydrogen, or nitrogen. The sample is injected as a single compact 
plug into the carrier gas stream immediately ahead of the column entrance. If the sample is liquid, 
the injection chamber is heated to vaporize the liquid rapidly. The separation column may consist of 
a metal or glass tube packed with an inert solid of high surface area covered with a liquid phase, or 
it may consist of an active solid, which enables the separation to occur. More commonly, capillary 
columns are employed, which consist of very small diameter, very long tubes in which the liquid 
phase is coated on the inside of the column.
The component that primarily determines the sensitivity of gas chromatographic analysis and, 
for some classes of compounds, the selectivity as well, is the detector. One such device is the ther-
mal conductivity detector, which responds to changes in the thermal conductivity of gases passing 
over it. The electron-capture detector, which is especially useful for halogenated hydrocarbons and 
phosphorus compounds, operates through the capture of electrons emitted by a b-particle source. 
The fl  ame-ionization gas chromatographic detector is very sensitive for the detection of organic 
compounds. It is based on the phenomenon by which organic compounds form highly conducting 
fragments, such as C+, in a fl  ame. Application of a potential gradient across the fl  ame results in a 
small current that may be readily measured. The mass spectrometer, described in Section 25.6, may 
be used as a detector for a GC. A combined GC/MS instrument is an especially powerful analytical 
tool for organic compounds.
Chromatographic analysis requires that a compound exhibit at least a few mm of vapor pressure 
at the highest temperature at which it is stable. In many cases, organic compounds that cannot be 
chromatographed directly may be converted to derivatives that are amenable to gas chromatographic 
analysis. It is seldom possible to analyze organic compounds in water by direct injection of the water 
into the GC; higher concentration is usually required. Two techniques commonly employed to 
remove volatile compounds from water and concentrate them are extraction with solvents and 0.2 ppb Cu

 purging volatile compounds with a gas, such as helium; concentrating the purged gases on a short 
column; and driving them off by heat into the chromatograph.
25.5.1 H IGH-PERFORMANCE  LIQUID  CHROMATOGRAPHY
A liquid mobile phase used with very small column-packing particles enables high-resolution chro-
matographic separation of materials in the liquid phase. Very high pressures up to several thousand 
psi are required to get a reasonable fl  ow rate in such systems. Analysis using such devices is called 
high-performance liquid chromatography  (HPLC)  an d  o ff e rs  an  e n o rm o u s  a d v an ta g e  in  th a t  th e  
materials analyzed need not be changed to the vapor phase, a step that often requires preparation of a 
volatile derivative or results in decomposition of the sample. The basic features of a high- performance 
liquid chromatograph are the same as those of a gas chromatograph shown in Figure 25.5, except that 
a solvent reservoir and high-pressure pump are substituted for the carrier gas source and regulator. A 
hypothetical HPLC chromatogram is shown in Figure 25.6. Refractive index and ultraviolet detectors 
are both used for the detection of peaks coming from the liquid chromatograph column. Fluorescence 
detection can be especially sensitive for some classes of compounds.
Mass spectrometric detection of HPLC effl  uents has led to the development of LC/MS analysis. 
This powerful tool enables measurement of highly polar water contaminants without the necessity 
of forming volatile derivatives of analytes to be separated by GC and can be used to measure ana-
lytes down to the nanogram per liter levels. LC/MS is especially useful for the determination of a 
variety of emerging contaminants including pharmaceuticals and their metabolites, hormones, and 
endocrine-disrupting species.

25.5.2 C HROMATOGRAPHIC  ANALYSIS  OF WATER POLLUTANTS
The U.S. EPA has developed a number of chromatography-based standard methods for determining 
water pollutants. Some of these methods use the purge-and-trap technique, bubbling gas through a 
column of water to purge volatile organics from the water followed by trapping the organics on solid 
sorbents, whereas others use solvent extraction to isolate and concentrate the organics. These 
 methods are summarized in Table 25.2.
25.5.3 I ON CHROMATOGRAPHY
The liquid chromatographic determination of ions, particularly anions, by ion chromatography  has 
enabled the measurement of species that used to be very troublesome for water chemists. The devel-
opment of this technique has been facilitated by special detection techniques using suppressors to 
enable detection of analyte ions in the chromatographic effl  uent. Ion chromatography has been 
developed for the determination of most of the common anions, including arsenate, arsenite, borate, 
carbonate, chlorate, chlorite, cyanide, the halides, hypochlorite, hypophosphite, nitrate, nitrite, 
phosphate, phosphite, pyrophosphate, selenate, selenite, sulfate, sulfi  te, sulfi  de, trimetaphosphate, 
and tripolyphosphate. Cations, including the common metal ions, can also be determined by ion 
chromatography.

 separation based on the charge-to-mass ratio and measurement of the ions produced. The output of 
a mass spectrometer is a mass spectrum, such as the one shown in Figure 25.7. A mass spectrum is 
characteristic of a compound and serves to identify it. Computerized data banks for mass spectra 
have been established and are stored in computers interfaced with mass spectrometers. Identifi  cation 
of a mass spectrum depends on the purity of the compound from which the spectrum is taken. Prior 
separation by GC with continual sampling of the column effl  uent by a mass spectrometer, com-
monly called GC-MS, is particularly effective in the analysis of organic pollutants.
25.7 ANALYSIS OF WATER SAMPLES
The preceding sections of this chapter have covered the major kinds of analysis techniques that are 
used on water. In this section, several specifi  c aspects of water analysis are addressed.
25.7.1 P HYSICAL  PROPERTIES  MEASURED  IN WATER
The commonly determined physical properties of water are color, residue (solids), odor, tempera-
ture, specifi  c conductance, and turbidity. Most of these terms are self-explanatory and will not be 
discussed in detail. All of these properties either infl  uence or refl  ect the chemistry of the water. 
Solids, for example, arise from chemical substances either suspended or dissolved in the water and 
are classifi  e d  p h y s i c a l l y  a s  t o t a l ,  fi  lterable, nonfi  lterable, or volatile. Specifi  c conductance is a 
 measure of the degree to which water conducts alternating current and refl  ects, therefore, the total 
concentration of dissolved ionic material. By necessity, some physical properties must be measured 
in the water without sampling (see discussion of water sampling below).
25.7.2 W ATER SAMPLING

 emphasized, however, that the acquisition of meaningful data demands that correct sampling and 
storage procedures be used. These procedures may be quite different for various species in water. 160 170 180 190 200 210 220 230

water pollutant.688 Environmental Chemistry
In  general, separate samples must be collected for chemical and biological analysis because the 
sampling and preservation techniques differ signifi  cantly. Usually, the shorter the time interval 
between  sample collection and analysis, the more accurate the analysis will be. Indeed, some 
analyses must be performed in the fi  eld within minutes of sample collection. Others, such as the 
determination of temperature, must be performed on the body of water itself. Within a few minutes 
after collection, water pH may change, dissolved gases (oxygen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfi  de, 
and chlorine) may be lost, or other gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) may be absorbed from the 
atmosphere. Therefore, analyses of temperature, pH, and dissolved gases should always be per-
formed in the fi  eld. Furthermore, precipitation of calcium carbonate accompanies changes in the 
pH- alkalinity- calcium carbonate relationship following sample collection. Analysis of a sample 
after standing may thus give erroneously low values for calcium and total hardness.
Oxidation–reduction reactions may cause substantial errors in analysis. For example, soluble 
iron(II) and manganese(II) are oxidized to insoluble iron(III) and manganese(IV) compounds 
when an anaerobic water sample is exposed to atmospheric oxygen. Microbial activity may decrease 
phenol or biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) values, change the nitrate–nitrite–ammonia balance, 
or alter the relative proportions of sulfate and sulfi  de. Iodide and cyanide are frequently oxidized. 
Chromium(VI) in solution may be reduced to insoluble chromium(III). Sodium, silicate, and boron 
are leached from glass container walls.
Samples can be divided into two major categories. Grab samples  are taken at a single time and 
in a single place. Therefore, they are very specifi  c with respect to time and location. Composite 
samples  are collected over an extended time and may encompass different locations as well. In 
principle, the average results from a large number of grab samples give the same information as a 
composite sample. A composite sample has the advantage of providing an overall picture from only 
one analysis. On the other hand, it may miss extreme concentrations and important variations that 
occur over time and space.
25.7.2.1 Extractors
The ease and effectiveness of various kinds of solid-phase devices for water sampling is steadily 
 increasing their use in water analysis. Based on size and physical confi  guration, several categories of 
such devices are available. One of these is the conventional solid-phase extractor (SPE) containing an 
extracting solid in a column. Activated carbon has been used for decades for this purpose, but syn-
thetic materials, such as those composed of long hydrocarbon chains (C18) bound to solids have been 
found to be quite useful. A typical procedure uses a polymer-divinylstyrene extraction column to 
remove pesticides from water. The pesticide analytes are eluted from the SPE with ethyl acetate and 
measured by GC.
Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) devices constitute a second kind of SPE. These make use 
of very small diameter tubes in which analytes are bonded directly to the extractor walls, and then 
eluted directly into a chromatograph. The use of SPME devices for the determination of haloethers 
in water has been described.
A third kind of device that is simple, convenient, and available for a number of classes of com-
pounds consists of disks composed of substances that bind with and remove analytes from water when 
the water is fi  ltered through them. As an example, solid-phase extraction disks can be used to remove 
and concentrate radionuclides from water, including 99Tc, 137Cs, 90Sr, and 238Pu. Organic materials 
sampled from water with such disks include haloacetic acids and acidic and neutral herbicides. 
Liquid–liquid extraction  of organic-soluble analytes has long been used to extract these materials 
from water and isolate them in a solvent that can be reduced to a small volume in which analytes can 
be further concentrated by a Kuderna–Danish evaporator or nitrogen blowing. Relatively high con-
sumption of solvent (creating a disposal problem) and emulsion formation can be problems with 
 liquid–liquid extraction. As an alternative for volatile and semivolatile analytes, membrane extrac-
tion can be used. This procedure entails running the water sample over one side of a membrane 
through which the analytes migrate to another solvent on the other side. Water can even be used as a Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastewater 689
collector solvent. In the case of ionizable organics, for example, the pH on the sample side can be 
adjusted such that the analyte species are neutral, in which form they can migrate through an organo-
philic  membrane, and be collected in an aqueous solution that is at a pH adjusted such that the analyte 
species are ionized and hence cannot permeate back through the membrane. A procedure exists for 
the determination of semivolatile compounds in water in which the extracting solvent traverses the 
interior of hollow fi  bers and collects analytes from the water sample fl  owing over the outer surface of 
the fi bers. By pressurizing the solvent, a signifi  cant fraction of it is forced through the membrane into 
the water thereby concentrating the organic-soluble analytes in the solvent phase.
25.7.3 W ATER SAMPLE  PRESERVATION
It is not possible to completely protect a water sample from changes in composition. However, vari-
ous additives and treatment techniques can be employed to minimize sample deterioration. These 
methods are summarized in Table 25.3.
The most general method of sample preservation is refrigeration to 4°C. Freezing normally should 
be avoided because physical changes including precipitate formation and gas loss may adversely 
affect sample composition. Acidifi  cation is commonly applied to metal samples to prevent their 
 precipitation, and it also slows microbial action. In the case of metals, the samples should be fi  ltered 
before adding acid to enable determination of dissolved metals. Sample holding times vary from zero 
for parameters such as temperature or DO measured by a probe to 6 months for metals. Many 
 different kinds of samples, including those to be analyzed for acidity, alkalinity, and various forms 
of nitrogen or phosphorus, should not be held for more than 24 h. Details on water sample preserva-
tion are to be found in standard references on water analysis listed at the end of this chapter.
25.7.4 T OTAL ORGANIC  CARBON  IN WATER
It is important to measure dissolved organic carbon (Chapter 7) in water because it exerts an oxygen 
demand in water, often is in the form of toxic substances, and is a general indicator of water pollu-
tion. The measurement of total organic carbon, TOC, in water is performed by methods that, for the 
most part, totally oxidize the dissolved organic material to produce carbon dioxide. The amount of 
carbon dioxide evolved is taken as a measure of TOC.
TOC can be determined by a technique that uses a dissolved oxidizing agent, commonly potas-
sium peroxydisulfate, K2S2O8, promoted by ultraviolet light to oxidize the organic carbon to CO2. 
Phosphoric acid is added to the sample, which is sparged with nitrogen to drive off inorganic CO2. 
After sparging, the sample is pumped to a chamber containing a lamp emitting ultraviolet radiation 
of 184.9 nm. This radiation produces reactive free radical species such as the hydroxyl radical, HO∑,

(see Chapters 9, 12, and 13). These active species bring about the rapid oxidation of dissolved 
organic compounds as shown in the following general reaction:
 Organics + HO∑ Æ CO2 + H2O (25.13)
After the completion of oxidation, the CO2 is sparged from the system and measured with a gas 
chromatographic detector or by absorption in ultrapure water followed by a conductivity measure-
ment. Figure 25.8 is a schematic of a TOC analyzer.
25.7.5 M EASUREMENT  OF RADIOACTIVITY  IN WATER
There are several potential sources of radioactive materials that may contaminate water (see Section 
7 . 1 3 ) . Radioactiv e contamination of water is normally detected by measurements of gross b and 
gross a activity, a procedure that is simpler than detecting individual isotopes. The measurement is 
made from a sample formed by evaporating water to a very thin layer on a small pan, which is then 
inserted inside an internal proportional counter . This setup is necessary because b particles can 
penetrate only very thin detector windows, and a particles have essentially no penetrating power. 
More detailed information can be obtained for radionuclides that emit g rays by the use of g spec-
trum analysis. This technique employs solid-state detectors to resolve rather closely spaced g peaks 
in the sample’s spectra. In conjunction with multichannel spectrometric data analysis, it is possible 
to determine a number of radionuclides in the same sample without chemical separation. This 
method requires minimal sample preparation.

cyanobacteria and some kinds of algae growing in water produce potentially troublesome toxic 
substances. An HPLC/MS method of analysis for such toxins has been described.7

25.8 AUTOMATED WATER ANALYSES
Huge numbers of water analyses must often be performed in order to get meaningful results and for 
reasons of economics. This has resulted in the development of a number of automated procedures in 
which the samples are introduced through a sampler and the analyses performed and results posted 
without manual manipulation of reagents and apparatus. Such procedures have been developed and 
instruments marketed for the determination of a number of analytes, including alkalinity, sulfate, 
ammonia, nitrate/nitrite, and metals. Colorimetric procedures are popular for such automated ana-
lytical instruments, using simple, rugged colorimeters for absorbance measurements. Figure 25.9 
shows an automated analytical system for the determination of alkalinity. The reagents and sample 
liquids are transported through the analyzer by a peristaltic pump consisting basically of rollers 
moving over fl  exible tubing. By using different sizes of tubing, the fl  ow rates of the reagents are 
proportioned. Air bubbles are introduced into the liquid stream to aid mixing and to separate one 
sample from another. Mixing of the sample and various reagents is accomplished in mixing coils. 
Since many color-developing reactions are not rapid, a delay coil is provided that allows the color to 
develop before reaching the colorimeter. Bubbles are removed from the liquid stream by a debubbler 
prior to introduction into the fl  ow cell for colorimetric analysis.
25.9 SPECIATION
Speciation  refers to the determination of specifi  c species of elements rather than simply analysis of 
the elements. It applies especially to metals and metalloids, which may be relatively easy to measure 
as the element, but much more diffi  cult to determine as specifi  c species of the element. For example, 
it is a relatively straightforward process to measure total tin in water, but much more challenging 
(and important) to determine organotin species that might be present as pollutants. Arsenic provides 
an important example of signifi  cant elemental species in water. Inorganic arsenic can be present as 
either As(III) or As(V), of which the former is generally more toxic. Organoarsenic compounds can TABLE 25.4 (continued)

25.10 EMERGING CONTAMINANTS IN WATER ANALYSIS
Emerging contaminants  in water analysis refers to species that have been recognized as signifi  cant 
water contaminants relatively recently, the long-term effects of which are not very well known. 
Approximately 3000 different substances are now used as pharmaceutical ingredients including 
antibiotics, painkillers, antidiabetics, contraceptives, antidepressants, impotence drugs, and a 
blockers and these substances and their metabolites get into water at very low levels. Major classes 
of emerging contaminants include the following:
Pharmaceuticals and their metabolites• 
Endocrine disruptors• 
Polybrominated compounds• 
Microbial toxins• 
Personal care products• 
Disinfection products• Delay

Organometallic compounds• 
Nanomaterials• 
Some specifi  c substances that have been recognized as emerging contaminants relatively recently 
include the following: benzotriazoles, complexing agents used as anticorrosives; naphthenic acids, 
which are toxic endocrine disruptors remaining from the extraction of crude oil from tar sands, 
particularly in Alberta, Canada; ethylenedibromide, formerly added to leaded gasoline but still a 
problem in some groundwaters; and dioxane, widely produced as a solvent stabilizer.
Emerging contaminants in drinking water supplies are generally indicative of contamination by 
incompletely treated wastewater. Pharmaceuticals and their metabolites have the potential to cause 
direct health effects. Endocrine disruptors may affect health as well as sexual development in 
aquatic organisms. The organometallic compounds of most concern are the organotin compounds, 
which have industrial uses and have been used as biocides. Microbial toxins include substances 
produced by photosynthetic bacteria and algae growing in water supplies. An example consists of 
microcystins, cyclic peptides produced by cyanobacteria. 
A variety of analytical methods are used to determine concentrations of emerging contaminants 
in water. Especially useful are chromatographic methods coupled with MS or tandem MS (two mass 
spectrometers in tandem). Some of the specifi  c emerging contaminants that can be determined by 
solid-phase extraction of water contaminants measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) using electrospray ionization include meprobamate, ethynylestradiol, 
progesterone, caffeine, testosterone, androstenedione, acetaminophen, erythromycin, TCEP, hydro-
codone, oxybenzone, DEET, carbamazepine, diazepam, dilantin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, 
atrazine, triclosan, pentoxifylline, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, gemfi  brozil, fl  uoxetine, and 
iopromide. Including pharmaceuticals, steroids, personal care products, and pesticides, this list 
gives an idea of compounds included among emerging contaminants.
25.11 CHIRAL CONTAMINANTS
Chiral molecules  are those in which four different groups are arranged in three dimensions around an 
atom, usually of carbon, that constitutes a chiral center (see alanine below) such that the molecule 
cannot be directly superimposed over its mirror image. Two chiral molecules of the same compound, 
called enantiomers , have identical melting points, boiling points, and solubilities as well as generally 
identical chemical properties. They differ, often markedly, in their biochemical properties because of 
the exact fi  t required between enzyme active sites and the substrate molecules upon which the enzymes 
act. Therefore, chiral isomers may exhibit completely different environmental and toxicological 
behaviors. For example, one enantiomer of a herbicide may undergo biodegradation readily whereas 
the other is resistant to it. Biochemical differences between enantiomers may be especially pro-
nounced for pesticides. For example, one enantiomer of a herbicide may kill weeds very effectively 
whereas the other has no effect. An example is the R enantiomer of herbicidal mecoprop (Figure 7.14), 
which is now marketed as a herbicide in place of the racemic mixture with the S enantiomer.

Although important, the ability to determine specifi  c enantiomers of contaminants in water is 
relatively new. Most commonly, the compounds are separated by LC and measured by MS. This Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastewater 695
requires a separation medium that is selective for particular enantiomers. Cyclodextrins are most 
commonly used for this purpose.

26.1 INTRODUCTION
The analysis of hazardous wastes of various kinds for a variety of potentially dangerous substances 
is one of the most important aspects of hazardous waste management.1 These analyses are  performed 
for a number of reasons including tracing the sources of wastes, assessing the hazards posed by the 
wastes to surroundings and to waste remediation personnel, and determining the best means of 
waste treatment. This chapter is a brief overview of several of the main considerations applied to the 
analysis of wastes. Here, wastes are broadly defi  ned to include all kinds of solids, semisolids, 
 sludges, liquids, contaminated soils, sediments, and other kinds of materials that are either wastes 
themselves or are contaminated by wastes.
For the most part, the substances determined as part of waste analysis, the analytes , are  measured 
by techniques that are used for the determination of the same analytes in water (see methods 
described in Chapter 25) and, to a lesser extent, in air. However, the preparation techniques that 
must be employed for waste analysis are usually more complex than those used for the same  analytes 
in water. That is because the matrices in which the waste analytes are contained are usually  relatively 
complicated, which makes it diffi  cult to recover all the analytes from the waste and which  introduces 
interfering substances. As a result, the lower limits at which substances can be measured in wastes 
(the practical quantitation limit, see Section 25.1) are usually much higher than in water.
There are several distinct steps in the analysis of a waste. Compared to water, wastes are often 
highly heterogeneous, which makes the fi  rst step, collection of representative samples, diffi  cult. 
Whereas water samples can often be introduced into an analytical instrument with minimal 
 preparation, the processing of hazardous wastes to get a sample that can be introduced into an 
instrument is often relatively complicated. Such processing can consist of dilution of oily samples 
w i t h  a n  o r g a n i c  s o l v e n t ,  e x t r a c t i o n  o f  o r g a n i c  a n a l y t e s  i n t o  a n  o r g a n i c  s o l v e n t ,  e x t r a c t i o n  w i t h  
supercritical or subcritical hot liquids, evolution and collection of volatile organic analytes, or 
 digestion of solids with strong acids and oxidants to extract metals for atomic spectrometric  analysis. 
The products of these processes must often be subjected to relatively involved sample cleanup pro-
cedures to remove contaminants that might interfere with the analysis or damage the analytical 
instrument.
Over a number of years, the U.S. EPA has developed specialized methods for the  characterization 
of wastes. These methods are given in the publication entitled Test Methods for Evaluating Solid 
Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods , which is periodically updated to keep it current.2 Because of 
the diffi  cult and exacting nature of many of the procedures in this work and because of the  hazards 
associated with the use of reagents such as strong acids and oxidants used for sample digestion and 
solvents employed to extract organic analytes, anyone attempting analyses of hazardous waste 
materials should use this resource and follow procedures carefully with special attention to 
 precautions. “SW -846, ” as it is commonly known, is available in a convenient CD/ROM form as 
part of a comprehensive summary of environmental analytical methods.3 ASTM International, 
originally known as the American Society for Testing and Materials publishes comprehensive works 
on the analysis of environmental samples including solid wastes.4698 Environmental Chemistry
26.2 SAMPLE DIGESTION FOR ELEMENTAL ANALYSIS
In order to analyze a solid waste sample by fl  ame atomic absorption spectroscopy, graphite furnace 
absorption spectroscopy, inductively coupled argon plasma spectroscopy, or inductively coupled 
argon plasma mass spectrometry (MS), the sample must fi  rst be digested to get the analyte metals 
in solution. Digestion dissolves only those fractions of metals that can be put into solution under 
relatively extreme conditions and therefore enables measurement of available metals. It should be 
noted that sample digestion procedures generally use highly corrosive, dangerous reagents that are 
strong acids and strong oxidants. Therefore, digestion should be carried out only by carefully  trained 
personnel using the proper equipment, including fume hoods and adequate personnel protection.
EPA Method 3050 is a procedure for acid digestion of sediments, sludges, and soils. A sample of 
up to 2 g is treated with a mixture of nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide; the sample is then refl  uxed 
with either conc. HNO3 or conc. HCl, then refl  uxed with dilute HCl, fi  ltered, and the fi  ltrate  analyzed 
for metals.
Microwave heating can be used to assist the digestion of samples. The procedure for the digestion 
of aqueous liquids consists of mixing a 45-mL sample with 5 mL of concentrated nitric acid, placing 
it in a fl  uorocarbon (Tefl  on) digestion vessel, and heating for 20 min. After digestion is complete, the 
sample is cooled, solids are separated by fi  ltration or centrifugation, and the liquid remaining is 
analyzed by the appropriate atomic spectrometric technique.
Method 3052 is a procedure for microwave-assisted acid digestion of siliceous and organically 
based matrices. It can be used on a variety of kinds of samples including biological tissues, oils, 
oil-contaminated soils, sediments, sludges, and soil. This method is not appropriate for analyses of 
leachable metals, but is used for the measurement of total metals. A sample of up to 0.5 g is digested 
with microwave heating for 15 min in an appropriate acid mixture held in a fl  uorocarbon polymer 
container. Commonly, the reagents employed are a mixture of 9 mL of conc. nitric acid and 3 mL 
of hydrofl  uoric acid, although other acid mixtures employing reagents such as conc. HCl and 
 hydrogen peroxide may be used. The sample is heated in the microwave oven to 180°C and held at 
that temperature for at least 9.5 min. After heating, the residual solids are fi  ltered off and the fi  ltrate 
is analyzed for metals.
Many kinds of hazardous waste samples contain metals dissolved or suspended in viscous  petroleum 
products, including oils, oil sludges, tars, waxes, paints, paint sludges, and other hydrocarbon materi-
als. Method 3031 can be used to dissolve these metals—including antimony, arsenic, barium, beryl-
lium cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, lead molybdenum, nickel, selenium, silver,  thallium, 
vanadium, and zinc—in a form suitable for atomic spectrometric analysis. The procedure involves 
mixing 0.5 g of sample with 0.5 g of fi  nely ground KMnO4 and 1.0 mL of conc. H2SO4, which causes 
a strongly exothermic reaction to occur as the hydrocarbon matrix is oxidized. After the reaction has 
subsided, 2 mL of conc. HNO3 and 2 mL of conc. HCl are added, the sample is fi  ltered with fi  lter 
paper, the fi  lter paper is digested with conc. HCl, and the sample is diluted and analyzed for metals.
26.3 ANALYTE ISOLATION FOR ORGANICS ANALYSIS
The determination of organic analytes requires that they be isolated from the sample matrix. Since 
organic analytes are generally soluble in organic solvents, they can usually be extracted from  samples 
with a suitable solvent. Although extraction works well for nonvolatile and semivolatile analytes, it is 
not so suitable for VOCs, which are readily vaporized during sample processing. The volatile mate-
rials are commonly isolated by techniques that take advantage of their high vapor pressures.
26.3.1  SOLVENT  EXTRACTION
Method 3500 is a procedure for extracting nonvolatile or semivolatile compounds from a liquid or 
solid sample. The sample is extracted with an appropriate solvent, dried, and concentrated by 
 evaporating solvent in a Kuderna–Danish apparatus prior to further processing for analysis.Analysis of Wastes and Solids 699
A number of methods more complicated than Method 3 500 ha v e been devised f or e xtracting 
n o n v o l a t i l e  a n d  s e mi v o l a t i l e  a n a l y t e s  f r o m  w a s t e  s a m p l e s .  M e t h o d  3 5 4 0  u s e s  e x t r a c t i o n  w i t h  a  
Soxhlet extractor. This device, illustrated in Chapter 22, Figure 22.6, for the extraction of lipids 
from biological tissue, provides for recirculation of continuously redistilled fresh solvent over a 
sample of soils, sludges, and wastes. The sample is fi  rst mixed with anhydrous Na2SO4 to dry it, 
then placed inside an extraction thimble in the Soxhlet apparatus, which redistills a relatively small 
volume of extraction solvent over the sample. After extraction, the sample may be dried,  concentrated, 
and exchanged into another solvent prior to analysis.
Method 3545 uses pressurized fl  uid extraction at 100°C and a pressure up to 2000 psi to remove 
organophilic analyte species from solid samples including soils, clays, sediments, sludges, and 
waste solids. Used for the extraction of semivolatile organic compounds, organophosphorus 
 pesticides, organochlorine pesticides, chlorinated herbicides, and PCBs, it requires less solvent and 
takes less time than the Soxhlet extraction described above. Before extraction, the fi  nely ground 
10–30 g sample should be dried to prevent residual water from interfering with the extraction. It 
may be air-dried or dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 or pelletized diatomaceous Earth. An extraction 
time of 5 min is typically used.
M e t h o d  3 5 5 0  u s e s  s o n i c a t i o n  w i t h  u l t r a s o u n d  t o  e x p e d i t e  t h e  e x t r a c t i o n  o f  n o n v o l a t i l e  a n d  
 semivolatile organic compounds from solids including soils, sludges, and wastes. The procedure 
calls for subjecting the fi  nely divided dried sample mixed with solvent to ultrasound for a brief 
period of time. Low concentration samples may be subjected to multiple extractions with additional 
fresh solvent.
26.3.2  SUPERCRITICAL  FLUID EXTRACTION  
Although the requirement for specialized high-pressure equipment has limited its application, 
extraction with supercritical carbon dioxide maintained at temperatures and pressures above the 
critical point where separate liquid and vapor phases do not exist is a very effective means of 
 extracting some organic analytes from solid waste samples. A typical example of this technique is 
the extraction of estrogenic bisphenol A from sewage sludge for analysis.
Method 3561 is used to extract PAHs such as acenaphthene, benzo(a)pyrene, fl  uorene, and pyrene 
from solid samples with supercritical carbon dioxide. The actual procedure is relatively complicated 
and is divided into three steps. The fi  rst step extracts the more volatile compounds with pure 
 supercritical carbon dioxide at moderately low density and temperature. Less volatile PAHs are 
removed in the second step using supercritical carbon dioxide and methanol modifi  er. A third step 
using pure carbon dioxide is employed to purge the modifi  er from the system.
26.3.3  PRESSURIZED  LIQUID  EXTRACTION  AND SUBCRITICAL  WATER EXTRACTION
Pressurized liquid extraction and subcritical water extraction offer some of the advantages of 
 supercritical fl  uid extraction but under generally less severe conditions. Compared to conventional 
solvent extraction, both of these techniques are faster and consume less solvent.
Pressurized liquid extraction , also called accelerated solvent extraction , uses relatively small vol-
umes (60 mL or less) of organic solvents heated to 50°C to 200°C under suffi  cient pressure to  maintain 
the liquid state. This enables extraction of solid samples within 30 min. T ypically , polyhalogenated 
dibenzo- p-dioxins and benzo- p-furans have been extracted from solid samples within 15 min with a 
1/1 mixture of n-hexane and acetone at 130°C.4 Compound degradation was minimal.
Subcritical water extraction , or pressurized hot water extraction uses water heated to 100°C to 
374°C pressurized to maintain the liquid state. The dielectric constant of water under these condi-
tions changes with temperature, which can be adjusted to change the extraction characteristics and 
make it an effective extractant for organophilic analytes. Specifi  cally, as the temperature of sub-
critical liquid water is raised, its dielectric constant and polarity decrease making it a more 700 Environmental Chemistry
“ organic-like” extractant. Because it is more polar than organic solvents, water can also be more 
effective than common organic solvents in extracting polar analytes. Because of these characteris-
tics and the environmentally friendly character of water, hot water extraction is fi  nding greater use 
in the  analysis of solid waste materials and sludges.
A typical application of subcritical water extraction is the extraction of brominated fl  ame 
 retardants from sediment samples. The technique is reputed to be more effective than conventional 
Soxhlet extraction with solvents.
26.4 SAMPLE CLEANUP
Processing of most waste, soil, and sediment samples results in the extraction of extraneous 
 substances that can cause the observation of extraneous peaks, be detrimental to peak resolution 
and column effi  ciency, and be damaging to expensive columns and detectors. In order to obtain 
meaningful analytical results from the often complex samples of solid wastes, proper extraction and 
processing prior to analysis are critical. Sample  cleanup  refers to a variety of measures that can be 
t a k e n  t o  r e m o v e  t h e s e  c o n s t i t u e n t s  f r o m  s a m p l e  e x t r a c t s  b y  a  n u m b e r  o f  p r o c e d u r e s  i n c l u d i n g  
 distillation, partitioning with immiscible solvents, adsorption chromatography, gel permeation 
chromatography, or chemical destruction of interfering substances with acid, alkali, or oxidizing 
agents; two or more of these techniques may be used in combination. The most widely applicable 
cleanup technique is gel permeation chromatography, which can be used to separate substances with 
high molecular masses from the analytes of interest. Treatment by adsorption column  chromatography 
with alumina, Florisil, or silica gel can be used to isolate a relatively narrow polarity range of 
analytes away from interfering substances. Acid–base partitioning can be used in the determination 
of materials such as chlorophenoxy herbicides and phenols to separate acidic, basic, and neutral 
organics. Table 26.1 shows the uses of the main sample cleanup techniques.
Alumina column cleanup makes use of highly porous granular aluminum oxide. Available in acidic, 
neutral, and basic pH ranges, this solid is packed into a column topped with a water- absorbing substance 
over which the sample is eluted with a suitable solvent, which leaves interferences on the column. After 
elution, the sample is concentrated, exchanged with another solvent if necessary, then analyzed. Florisil 
is an acidic magnesium silicate and a registered trade name of Floridin Co. It is used in a column 
cleanup procedure in a manner similar to alumina. Silica gel is a weakly acidic amorphous silicon 
oxide. It can be activated by heating for several hours at 150°C to 160°C and used for the separation of

hydrocarbons. Deactivated silica gel containing 10–20% water acts as an  adsorbent for compounds with 
ionic and nonionic functionalities such as dyes, alkali metal cations,  terpenoids, and plasticizers. It is 
used in a column as described for alumina above. Gel-permeation  chromatography separates solutes by 
size carried over a hydrophobic gel by organic solvents. A gel must be chosen that will separate the 
appropriate size range of analytes and interferences. The gel is preswelled before loading onto a column 
and fl  ushed extensively with solvent before the sample is introduced for separation.
26.5 SAMPLE PREPARATION FOR VOCs
Many different VOCs are found at waste sites and in various kinds of waste solid and sludge  samples. 
These include benzene, bromomethane, chloroform, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, dichloromethane,  styrene, 
toluene, vinyl chloride, and the xylene isomers. Various methods are employed to isolate and 
 concentrate VOCs from the solid, sludge, or liquid matrices in which they are contained.
Method 5021, “volatile organic compounds in soils and other solid matrices using equilibrium 
headspace analysis” is used to isolate VOCs from soil, sediment, or solid waste samples for  determination 
by gas chromatography (GC) or GC/MS. This procedure makes use of a special glass headspace vial 
that contains at least 2 g of sample. A matrix-modifying preservative solution, internal standards, and 
surrogate compounds may be added to the sample and mixed  thoroughly by rotating the vial. The sam-
ple is heated to 85°C for approximately 1 h prior to injection into the gas chromatograph. For injection, 
helium is forced under pressure into the vial and a sample of the gas in the headspace above the solid 
sample is forced out of the vial and into the gas  chromatograph system for quantitation.
Method 5030 is a purge-and-trap procedure that can be used to collect for gas chromatographic  
analysis poorly water-soluble compounds that have boiling points below 200°C, which includes a wide 
variety of compounds commonly occurring in hazardous wastes. For samples in water, helium is bub-
bled through the sample and the volatile analyte compounds are absorbed on a sorbent  column. Solid 
samples can be dispersed in methanol and the methanol added to water for the purging step. After the 
purging is complete, the sorbent column is heated and fl  ushed with carrier gas to sweep the sample 
compounds into the gas chromatograph for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the VOCs present.
Method 5035 is a closed-system, purge-and-trap and extraction method applicable to the deter-
mination of VOCs in soil, sediment, and waste samples. For the determination of very low levels of 
VOCs in soil, a sealed sample vial is used that remains sealed throughout the sample processing 
operations. An approximately 5-g sample is weighed into a sample vial containing a stirring bar and 
sodium bisulfate preservative solution, and the vial is sealed and transported to the laboratory as 
soon as possible. For analysis, reagent water, surrogates, and internal standards are injected into the 
vial without opening it. The contents of the vial are purged with helium gas into an appropriate 
sampling trap, then fl  ushed into the gas chromatograph for measurement.
Method 5031 is used to isolate volatile, nonpurgeable, water-soluble compounds by azeotropic 
distillation. The analyte compounds for which it is suitable include acetone, acetonitrile,  acrylonitrile, 
allyl alcohol, 1-butanol, t-butyl alcohol, crotonaldehyde, 1,4-dioxane, ethanol, ethyl acetate,  ethylene 
oxide, isobutyl alcohol, methanol, methylethyl ketone, methylisobutyl ketone, n-nitroso-di- n-butyl-
amine, paraldehyde, 2-pentanone, 2-picoline, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, propionitrile, pyridine, and 
o-toluidine. The technique takes advantage of the formation of an azeotrope liquid mixture of water 
and analytes that boil at a constant temperature and give off vapors of a constant composition. For 
separation of the analyte species, a 1-L sample is adjusted to pH 7 with a buffer, and a small sample 
of condensate enriched in analyte species is collected. The organics are measured in the azeotrope 
solution distilled from the sample.
Method 5032 employs vacuum distillation to isolate volatile organic analytes from liquid, solid, 
and oily waste matrices, and even animal tissues. Examples of compounds isolated for analysis 
b y  t h i s  p r o c e d u r e  i n c l u d e  a c e t o n e ,  b e n z e n e ,  c a r b o n  d i s u l fi  de, chloroform, ethanol, styrene, 
 tetrachloroethene, vinyl chloride, and the o-, m-, p-xylene isomers. Such compounds should be no 
more than minimally soluble in water and should boil below 180°C. The sample in water is distilled 702 Environmental Chemistry
under a vacuum and the water condensed in a chilled condenser. Volatile analyte constituents not 
condensed with the water vapor are swept into a cryogenic trap maintained at liquid nitrogen 
 temperature of −196°C for collection. For analysis, the contents of the trap are evaporated at an 
elevated temperature and swept into the chromatograph.
Method 3585, waste dilution for volatile organics, is employed to place a nonaqueous waste sample 
of volatile organics into the appropriate form for injection into a gas chromatograph. It is applicable 
to samples containing analytes at levels of 1 mg/kg or higher. The procedure calls for placing a 1 g 
oil-phase sample into a vial marked for a volume of 10 mL, diluting with n-hexa decane or other 
appropriate solvent, sealing the vial, and mixing to dissolve the sample. Because the diluted sample 
usually contains residual materials from the sample with a tendency to foul the gas chromatograph, 
the sample is injected through a replaceable direct injection liner containing Pyrex glass wool.
26.6 BIOASSAY AND IMMUNOASSAY SCREENING OF WASTES
Several important biologically based methods are used to characterize wastes and particularly to 
assess the dangers that they pose to the biosphere.5 Acute toxicity tests that cover a relatively short 
period of the life cycle of organisms can be useful in fi  nding materials that may pose immediate 
hazards. Long-lasting effects are assayed by chronic toxicity tests that measure such things as 
 fertilization, growth, and reproduction. These tests normally have been conducted over the full life 
cycle of the organism or shortened to 30 days, an “early-stage test.” The U.S. EPA has developed a 
7-day chronic toxicity test that applies to early life-cycle stages of organisms, a time period during 
which the organisms are most sensitive to toxicants.
Immunoassay has emerged as a useful technique for screening wastes for specifi  c kinds of 
 pollutants.6 Commercial immunoassay techniques have been developed that permit very rapid  analyses 
of large numbers of samples. A variety of immunoassay techniques have been developed. These tech-
niques all use biologically produced antibodies that bind specifi  cally to analytes or classes of analytes. 
This binding is combined with chemical processes that enable detection through a signal-producing 
species (reporter reagent) such as enzymes, chromophores, fl  uorophores, and luminescent compounds. 
The reporter reagent binds with the antibody. When an analyte is added to the antibody to displace the 
reagent, the concentration of displaced reagent is proportional to the level of analyte displacing it from 
the antibody. Detection of the displaced reporter reagent enables quantifi  cation of the analyte.
Immunoassay techniques are divided into the two major categories: heterogeneous and 
 homogeneous; the former requires a separation (washing) step whereas the latter does not require 
such a step. Typically, when heterogeneous procedures are used, the antibody is immobilized on a 
solid support on the inner surface of a disposable test tube. The sample is contacted with the  antibody 
displacing reporter reagent, which is removed by washing. The amount of reagent displaced, 
 commonly measured spectrophotometrically, is proportional to the amount of analyte added. Very 
widely used enzyme immunoassays make use of reporter reagent molecules bound with enzymes, 
and kits are available for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) of a number of organic 
species likely to be found in hazardous wastes.
Immunoassay techniques have been approved for the determination of numerous analytes com-
monly found in hazardous wastes. Where the EPA method numbers are given in parentheses, these 
include pentachlorophenol (4010), 2,4-D (4015), PCBs (4020), petroleum hydrocarbons (4030), PAHs 
(4035), toxaphene (4040), chlordane (4041), DDT (4042), TNT explosives in soil (4050), and hexahydro-
1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) in soil (4051). ELISA have been reported for  monitoring pentachloro-
phenol, BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and o-, m-, and p-xylene) in industrial effl  uents.

heavy metals and metal radionuclides at waste disposal sites, with their potential to contaminate Analysis of Wastes and Solids 703
 groundwater. Therefore, the determination of chelating agents, such as EDTA and N-(2-hydroxyethyl) 
ethylenediaminetriacetic acid (HEDTA), is an important analytical procedure for wastes. Most 
 chelating agents of concern at waste sites are polar and nonvolatile, which prevents their  determination 
by direct gas chromatographic methods. One of the more satisfactory methods for their  determination 
makes use of derivatization to produce volatile species suitable for gas chromatographic analysis. 
A method has been described for the determination of chelating agents in hazardous wastes from 
radioactive wastes using derivatization followed by gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric 
(GC/MS) analysis.7 The study involved wastes contained in a potentially leaking double-shell 
 storage tank at the U.S. Department of Energy Hanford site. Treatment with BF3 and methanol pro-
duced volatile derivatives that were measured by GC/MS. In addition to EDTA and HEDTA, the 
study showed the presence of NTA and citrate chelating agents, and chelating nitrosoiminio-
diacetate was produced as an artifact of the analytical procedure.
26.8 TOXICITY CHARACTERISTIC LEACHING PROCEDURE
The TCLP is specifi  ed to determine the potential toxicity hazard of various kinds of wastes.8 The 
test was designed to estimate the availability to organisms of both inorganic and organic species in

hazardous materials present as liquids, solids, or multiple phase mixtures by producing a leachate, 
the TCLP extract, which is analyzed for the specifi  c toxicants listed in Table 26.2.
The procedure for conducting the TCLP is rather involved. The procedure need not be run at all 
if a total analysis of the sample reveals that none of the pollutants specifi  ed in the procedure could 
exceed regulatory levels. At the opposite end of the scale, analysis of any of the liquid fractions of 
the sample showing that any regulated species would exceed regulatory levels even after the  dilutions 
involved in the TCLP measurement have been carried out designate the sample as hazardous, and 
the TCLP measurement is not required.
In conducting the TCLP test, if the waste is a liquid containing less than 0.5% solids, it is fi  ltered 
through a 0.6–0.8 μm glass fi  ber fi  lter and the fi  ltrate is designated as the TCLP extract. At levels of 
the solids exceeding 0.5%, any liquid present is fi  ltered off for separate analysis and the solid is 
extracted to provide a TCLP extract (after size reduction, if the particles exceed certain size 
 limitations). The choice of the extraction fl  uid is determined by the pH of the aqueous solution 
 produced by shaking a mixture of 5 g of solids and 96.5 mL of water. If the pH is <5.0, a pH 4.93 
acetic acid/sodium acetate buffer is used for extraction; otherwise, the extraction fl  uid used is a pH 
of 2.88 ± 0.05 solution of dilute acetic acid. Extractions are carried out in a sealed container rotated 
end-over-end for 18 h. The liquid portion is then separated and analyzed for the specifi  c substances 
given in Table 26.2. If values exceed the regulatory limits, the waste is designated as “toxic.”

and Air Pollutants
27.1 ATMOSPHERIC MONITORING
Good anal yti cal methodo l o gy , parti cular l y that app li cab l e to au tomated anal y s is and con tin uous 
monitoring, is essential to the study and alleviation of air pollution. The atmosphere is a particularly 
diffi c u l t  a n a l y t i c a l  s y s t e m  b e c a u s e  o f  t h e  v e r y  l o w  l e v e l s  o f  s u b s t a n c e s  t o  b e  a n a l y z e d ;  s h a r p  
 variations in pollutant level with time and location; differences in temperature and humidity; and 
diffi culties encountered in reaching desired sampling points, particularly those substantially above 
the earth’s surface. Furthermore, although improved techniques for the analysis of air pollutants are 
continually being developed, a need still exists for new analytical methodology and the  improvement 
of existing methodology.
Much of the earlier data on air pollutant levels were unreliable as a result of inadequate analysis 
and sampling methods. An atmospheric pollutant analysis method does not have to give the actual 
value to be useful. One which gives a relative value may still be helpful in establishing trends in 
pollutants levels, determining pollutant effects, and locating pollution sources. Such methods may 
continue to be used while others are being developed.
Atmospheric analysis is a dynamic area that continues to benefi  t from advances in  instrumentation 
and techniques. Standard methods of atmospheric chemical analysis have been summarized.1,2
27.1.1  AIR POLLUTANTS  MEASURED
The air pollutants generally measured may be placed in several different categories. In the United 
States, one such category contains materials for which ambient (surrounding atmosphere) standards 
have been set by the EPA. These are sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, nonmethane 
hydrocarbons, and particulate matter. The standards are categorized as primary and secondary. 
Primary standards  are those defi  ning the level of air quality necessary to protect public health. 
Secondary standards  are designed to provide protection against known or expected adverse effects 
of air pollutants, particularly upon materials, vegetation, and animals. Another group of air  pollutants 
t o  b e  m e a s ur e d  c o n s i s t s  o f  th o s e  kn o w n  t o  b e  s p e c i fi  cally hazardous to human health, such as 
 asbestos, beryllium, and mercury. Still another category of air pollutants contains those regulated 
in new installations of selected stationary sources, such as coal-cleaning plants, cotton gins, lime 
plants, and paper mills. Some pollutants in this category are visible emissions, acid (H2SO4) mist, 
particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur oxides. These substances often must be monitored in 
the stack to ensure that emission standards are being met. A fourth category consists of the  emissions 
of mobile sources (motor vehicles)—hydrocarbons, CO, and NOx. A fi  fth group consists of 
 miscellaneous elements and compounds, such as certain heavy metals, fl  uoride, chlorine,  phosphorus, 
PAHs, PCBs, odorous compounds, reactive organic compounds, and radionuclides. Much of the 
remainder of this chapter is devoted to a discussion of the analytical methods for most of the species 
mentioned above.708 Environmental Chemistry
The units in which air pollutants and air-quality parameters are expressed include for gases and 
vapors, mg/m3 (alternatively, ppm by volume); for mass of particulate matter, mg/m3; for particulate 
matter count, number per cubic meter; for visibility, km; for instantaneous light transmission, 
 percentage of light transmitted; for emission and sampling rates, m3/min; for pressure, mm Hg; and 
for temperature, °C. Air volumes should be converted to conditions of 10°C and 760 mm Hg (1 atm), 
assuming ideal gas behavior.
27.2 SAMPLING
The ideal atmospheric analysis techniques are those that work successfully without sampling, such 
as long-path laser resonance absorption monitoring. For many analyses, however, various types of 
sampling are required. In some very sophisticated monitoring systems, samples are collected and 
analyzed automatically and the results are transmitted to a central receiving station. Often, however, 
a batch sample is collected for later chemical analysis.
The analytical result from a sample can only be as good as the method employed to obtain that 
sample. A number of factors enter into obtaining a good sample. The size of the sample required 
(total volume of air sampled) decreases with increasing concentration of pollutant and increasing 
sensitivity of the analytical method. Often a sample of 10 or more cubic meters is required. The 
sampling rate is determined by the equipment used and generally ranges from approximately 
0.003 to 3.0 m3/min. The duration of sampling time infl  uences the result obtained, as shown in 
 Figure 27.1. The actual concentration of the pollutant is shown by the solid line. A sample collected 
over an 8-h period has the concentration shown by the dashed line, whereas samples taken over 1-h 
intervals exhibit the concentration levels shown by the dotted line. Sampling techniques are 
 discussed briefl  y for specifi  c kinds of analytes later in this chapter.
Methods for sampling atmospheric particles are discussed in Section 27.9. The main methods for 
particle sampling are simple sedimentation, fi  ltration, and impingement of an airstream onto a 
 surface that collects particles.
Sampling for vapors and gases may range from methods intended to collect only one specifi  c 
pollutant to those designed to collect all pollutants. The most fundamental method of sampling 
is whole-air sampling  in which a volume of air is collected in a bag or steel or glass container. 
Loss of analyte by adsorption onto container walls can be a problem with this technique. Essentially, 
all pollutants may be removed from an air sample cryogenically by freezing or by liquifying the air 
in collectors maintained at a low temperature. Analytes can be collected on solid sorbents over 
which air is fi  ltered or by bubbling through liquids. Collection methods can be dynamic  in which 
air is pumped through a sampling medium or passive  in which a sampling medium, such as a 
 semipermeable bag fi  lled with sorbent material, is simply exposed to air over a period of time 
(see below).

Also used in water analysis, solid-phase microextraction  combines sampling and preconcentra-
tion in which VOCs are collected from air by pumping over a small amount of fi  ber holding an 
 extraction medium. The analyte can then be evolved from the extraction device directly into a gas 
 chromatograph for measurement.
Denuders  are among the more useful sampling devices for certain kinds of air pollutants. 
Denuders solve a major sampling problem by enabling collection of gas-phase pollutants free of 
c o n t a m i n a t i o n  b y  p a r t i c l e s .  O t h e r w i s e ,  f o r  s o m e  p o l l u t a n t s  s u c h  a s  a c i d s ,  i t  i s  n o t  p o s s i b l e  t o  
 distinguish relative amounts of analytes in the gas phase from those in particulate form.
Diffusion denuders run a laminar fl  ow airstream through a tube, the walls of which are covered 
with a sorptive or reactive collecting medium for the analytes of interest. The diffusion coeffi  cients 
of small particles are only about 10-4 those of gases, so that the particles go through the tube, and 
the gases diffuse to the walls and are collected. Open-bore denuders consist of tubes with coated 
walls. A more effi  cient device is the annular denuder  composed of concentric tubes separated by 
1–2 mm of annular space. Thermodenuders  use heat to drive off analytes collected by the device. 
They can be used for semicontinuous analysis by employing a collection/analysis cycle involving 
alternate collection and thermal desorption. Diffusion scrubbers  are denuders in which walls are 
composed of membranes such that gas from the sample goes through the wall and is collected in a 
collecting liquid.
An annular denuder coated with citric acid can be used to collect gaseous ammonia in air. Gaseous 
HCl, HNO2, and SO2 can be collected on the wall of a denuder coated with sodium carbonate.
Passive  air sampling devices can be used for semiquantitative analysis of air contaminants. POP, 
such as PCBs may be collected from ambient air by devices consisting of triolein lipid material held 
inside tubes of permeable membrane material suspended in contact with the air. Such samplers may 
be left in place for many days or weeks and yield an integrated value of air contaminants.
Somewhat related to passive air sampling devices in principle are surrogate sampling  media 
consisting of materials that are in contact with the air naturally for prolonged periods of time. Pine 
needles and tree bark have been used as surrogate sampling media. An interesting surrogate 
 sampling medium is butter from cows’ milk. This medium is especially useful for lipophilic POP , 
such as PCBs. These materials deposit from air onto forage eaten by cows and become concen-
trated in the milk fat and hence in butter.
Chemisorption reactions  in which analytes react chemically with substances on a solid surface 
can be used to capture some air pollutants for analysis. One such process uses 2,4-dinitrophenyl-
hydrazine contained in a cartridge through which air is pumped to sample the important class of 
 carbonyl compounds (aldehydes and ketones) in the atmosphere. The adsorbent reacts with carbonyl 
compounds to form hydrazone compounds as shown by the reaction of acetaldehyde below and 
the hydrazone products are eluted with acetonitrile and measured by high-performance liquid 
 chromatography using spectrophotometric detection.

27.3 METHODS OF ANALYSIS
A very large number of different analytical techniques are used for atmospheric pollutant analysis. 
Some of these, the uses of which are not confi  ned to atmospheric analysis, were discussed in 
Chapters 25 and 26. Techniques confi  ned largely to atmospheric analysis are discussed in the 
remainder of this chapter. A summary of some of the main instrumental techniques for air monitor-
ing is presented in Table 27.1.710 Environmental Chemistry
The U.S. EPA specifi  es reference methods of analysis for selected air pollutants to determine 
compliance with the primary and secondary national ambient air quality standards for those 
 pollutants. These methods are published annually in the Code of Federal Regulations .3 They are not 
necessarily state-of-the art, and in some cases are outdated and cumbersome. However, for  regulatory 
and legal purposes they provide reliable measurements proven to be valid.
27.4 DETERMINATION OF SULFUR DIOXIDE
The reference method for the analysis of sulfur dioxide is the spectrophotometric pararosaniline 
method developed by West and Gaeke.4 It is applicable to the analysis of 0.005–5 ppm SO2 in ambient 
air. The method makes use of a collecting solution of 0.04 M potassium  tetrachloromercurate to 
 collect sulfur dioxide according to the following reaction:
 HgCl42- + SO2 + H2O Æ HgCl2SO32- + 2H+ + 2Cl- (27.2)

dioxide against the oxidizing agents of oxidants such as ozone and nitrogen oxides. For analysis, 
sulfur dioxide in the scrubbing medium is reacted with formaldehyde:
 HCHO + SO2 + H2O Æ HOCH2SO3H (27.3)
The adduct formed is then reacted with uncolored organic pararosaniline hydrochloride to produce 
a red-violet dye. Although NO2 at levels above about 2 ppm interferes, the interference may be 
 eliminated by reducing the NO2 to N2 gas with sulfamic acid, H2NSO3H. The level of SO2 measured TABLE 27.1

spectrophotometrically is corrected to standard ambient conditions of 25°C and atmospheric 
 pressure (101 kPa). The lower limit of detection of SO2 in 10 mL of the collecting solution is 0.75 mg. 
This represents a concentration of 25 mg SO2/m3 (0.01 ppm) in an air sample of 30 standard liters 
(short-term sampling), and a concentration of 13 mg SO2/m3 (0.005 ppm) in an air sample of 288 
standard liters (long-term sampling).
Performed manually, the West–Gaeke method for sulfur dioxide analysis is cumbersome and 
complicated. However, the method has been refi  ned to the point that it can be done automatically with 
continuous-monitoring equipment. A block diagram of such an analyzer is shown in Figure 27.2.
Conductimetry  (amperometry ) was used as the basis for a commercial continuous sulfur dioxide 
analyzer as early as 1929. Generally, the sulfur dioxide is collected in a solution of hydrogen 
 peroxide, which oxidizes the SO2 to H2SO4, and the resulting increased electrical conductance of 
the sulfuric acid solution is measured. Sulfur dioxide can be determined by ion chromatography by 
bubbling SO2 through hydrogen peroxide solution to produce SO42-, followed by analysis of the sul-
fate by ion chromatography, a method that separates ions on a chromatography column and detects 
them very sensitively by conductivity measurement. Flame photometry, sometimes in combination 
with GC, is used for the detection of sulfur dioxide and other gaseous sulfur compounds. The gas is 
burned in a hydrogen fl  ame, and the sulfur emission line at 394 nm is measured.
Several direct spectrophotometric methods are used for sulfur dioxide measurement, including 
nondispersive infrared absorption, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis, ultraviolet absorp-
tion, molecular resonance fl  uorescence, and second-derivative spectrophotometry. The principles of 
these methods are the same for any gas measured.
27.5 NITROGEN OXIDES
Several methods have been used to determine nitrogen oxides. As noted in Table 27.1, these methods 
include electrochemical methods, direct measurements of nitrogen oxides spectrophotometrically 
in the gas phase, and a wet chemical method based on formation of an azo dye. However, gas-phase 
chemiluminescence is the favored method of NOx analysis.5 The general phenomenon of chemi-
luminescence was defi  ned in Section 9.8. It results from the emission of light from electronically 
excited species formed by a chemical reaction. In the case of NO, ozone is used to bring about the 
reaction, producing electronically excited nitrogen dioxide:
 NO + O3 Æ NO2* + O2 (27.4)
The species loses energy and returns to the ground state through emission of light in the 600–
3000 nm range. The emitted light is measured by a photomultiplier; its intensity is proportional to 
the concentration of NO. A schematic diagram of the device used is shown in Figure 27.3.FIGURE 27.2 Block diagram of an automated system for the determination of sulfur dioxide by the para-

Since the chemiluminescence detector system depends upon the reaction of O3 wi th N O , i t is 
 necessary to convert NO2 to NO in the sample prior to analysis. This is accomplished by passing the 
air sample over a thermal converter, which brings about the desired conversion. Analysis of such a 
sample gives NOx, the sum of NO and NO2. Chemiluminescence analysis of a sample that has not 
been passed over the thermal converter gives NO. The difference between these two results is NO2.
Other nitrogen compounds besides NO and NO2 undergo chemiluminescence by reacting with 
O3, and these may interfere with the analysis if present at an excessive level. Particulate matter also 
causes interference which may be overcome by employing a membrane fi  lter on the air inlet.
This analysis technique is illustrative of chemiluminescence analysis in general. Chemi-
luminescence is an inherently desirable technique for the analysis of atmospheric pollutants because 
it can avoid wet chemistry, is basically simple, and lends itself well to continuous  monitoring and 
instrumental methods. Another chemiluminescence method, that employed for the analysis of 
ozone, is described in the next section.
27.6 ANALYSIS OF OXIDANTS
The atmospheric oxidants that are commonly analyzed include ozone, hydrogen peroxide, organic 
per oxides, and chlorine. The classic manual method for the analysis of oxidants is based upon their 
oxidation of I- ion followed by spectrophotometric measurement of the product. The sample is 
 collected in 1% KI buffered at pH 6.8. Oxidants react with iodide ion as shown by the following 
reaction of ozone:
 O3 + 2H+ + 3I- Æ I3- + O2 + H2O (27.5)
The absorbance of the colored I3- product is measured spectrophotometrically at 352 nm. Generally, 
the level of oxidant is expressed in terms of ozone, although it should be noted that not all  oxidants—PAN, 
for example—react with the same effi  ciency as O3. Oxidation of I- may be used to determine oxidants 
in a concentration range of several hundredths of a ppm to approximately 10 ppm. Nitrogen dioxide 
gives a limited response to the method, and reducing substances interfere seriously.
Now the favored method for oxidant analysis uses chemiluminescence.6 The chemiluminescent 
reaction is that between ozone and ethylene. Chemiluminescent radiation from this reaction is 
 emitted over a range of 300–6000 nm, with a maximum at 435 nm. The intensity of emitted light is 
directly proportional to the level of ozone. Ozone concentrations ranging from 0.003 to 30 ppm may 
be measured. Ozone for calibrating the instrument is generated photochemically from the  absorption 
of ultraviolet radiation by oxygen.FIGURE 27.3 Chemiluminescence detector for NOx.

27.7 ANALYSIS OF CARBON MONOXIDE
Carbon monoxide can be measured in the atmosphere by absorption of infrared radiation at 4.7 mm. 
Observation of the absorbance of solar radiation at this wavelength through the atmosphere can be 
used to calculate total column abundance and column concentrations of carbon monoxide. Carbon 
monoxide is analyzed in the atmosphere by nondispersive infrared spectrometry .7 This technique 
depends upon the fact that carbon monoxide absorbs infrared radiation strongly at certain wave-
lengths. Therefore, when such radiation is passed through a long (typically 100 cm) cell containing 
trace levels of carbon monoxide, more of the infrared radiant energy is absorbed.
A nondispersive infrared spectrometer differs from standard infrared spectrometers in that the 
infrared radiation from the source is not dispersed according to wavelength by a prism or grating. 
The nondispersive infrared spectrometer is made very specifi  c for a given compound, or type of 
compound, by using the sought-for material as part of the detector, or by placing it in a fi  lter cell in 
the optical path. A diagram of a nondispersive infrared spectrometer selective for CO is shown in 
Figure 27.4. Radiation from an infrared source is “chopped” by a rotating device so that it  alternately 
passes through a sample cell and a reference cell. In this particular instrument, both beams of light 
fall on a detector which is fi  lled with CO gas and separated into two compartments by a fl  exible 
diaphragm. The relative amounts of infrared radiation absorbed by the CO in the two sections of 
the detector depend upon the level of CO in the sample. The difference in the amount of infrared 
 radiation absorbed in the two-compartments causes slight differences in heating, so that the 
 diaphragm bulges slightly toward one side. Very slight movement of the diaphragm can be detected 
and recorded. By means of this device, carbon monoxide can be measured from 0 to 150 ppm, with 
a relative accuracy of ±5% in the optimum concentration range.
Flame-ionization GC detection can also be used for the analysis of carbon monoxide. This 
 detector system was described in Chapter 25, Section 25.5. It is selective for hydrocarbons, and

A major advantage of this approach is that the same basic instrumentation may be used to measure 
hydrocarbons.

Carbon monoxide may also be analyzed by measuring the heat produced by its catalytic oxida-
tion to CO2 over a catalyst consisting of a mixture of MnO2 and CuO. Differences in temperature 
between a cell in which the oxidation is occurring and a reference cell through which part of the 
sample is fl  owing are measured by thermistors. A vanadium oxide catalyst can be used for the 
 oxidation of hydrocarbons, enabling their simultaneous analysis.
27.8 DETERMINATION OF HYDROCARBONS AND ORGANICS 
Monitoring of hydrocarbons in atmospheric samples takes advantage of the very high sensitivity of 
the hydrogen fl  ame ionization detector to measure this class of compounds. Known quantities of air 
are run through the fl  ame ionization detector 4 to 12 times per hour to provide a measure of total 
h y droc arbo n  co n te n t.  A  se p ara te  po rti o n  o f  eac h  s am p l e  g oes  in to  a  s tri pper  co l umn  to  re m o v e  
water, carbon dioxide, and nonmethane hydrocarbons. Methane and carbon monoxide, which are 
not retained by the stripper column, are separated by a chromatographic column, passed through 
a catalytic reduction tube, and then to a fl  ame ionization detector. Eluting fi  rst, methane is not 
 changed by the reduction tube and is detected as methane by the detector. The carbon monoxide is

methane  product by the fl  ame ionization detector. Concentrations of nonmethane hydrocarbons are 
given by subtracting the methane concentrations from the total hydrocarbons.
Using the method described above, total hydrocarbons can be determined in a range of 
0–13 mg/ m3, corresponding to 0–10 ppm. Methane can be measured over a range of 0–6.5 mg/m3 
(0–10 ppm).
27.8.1  DETERMINATION  OF SPECIFIC  ORGANICS  IN THE ATMOSPHERE
The method for hydrocarbons described above gives total hydrocarbons and methanes. In some 
cases it is important to have a method to determine individual organics because of their toxicities, 
ability to form photochemical smog, as indicators of photochemical smog, and as means of tracing 
sources of pollution. Numerous techniques have been published for the determination of organic 
compounds in the atmosphere. For example, whole-air samples can be collected in Tedlar bags, 
concentrated cryogenically at −180°C, then thermally desorbed and measured with high-resolution 
capillary column GC.
The U.S. EPA has published several procedures for determining the identities and concentra-
tions of key organic air pollutants classifi  ed as air toxics.8 These include VOCs, such as benzene, 
vinyl chloride, and chloroform; organochlorine pesticides and PCBs; aldehydes and ketones; 
 phosgene; N-nitroso compounds; phenols, dioxin; nonmethane hydrocarbons, and PAHs. Sampling 
methods for various ones of these analytes include collection in canisters or bags, adsorption onto 
various solid sorbents, collection in liquids, and collection and reactions in reagent solutions. GC 
predom inates as an analysis technique with detection by MS, fl  ame ionization and electron capture. 
High-performance liquid chromatography is also used for the determination of some analytes.
27.9 ANALYSIS OF PARTICULATE MATTER
Particles are almost always removed from air or gas (such as exhaust fl  ue gas) prior to analysis. The 
two main approaches to particle isolation are fi  ltration and removal by methods that cause the gas 
stream to undergo a sharp bend such that particles are collected on a surface.
27.9.1  FILTRATION
The method commonly used for determining the quantity of total suspended particulate matter in 
the atmosphere draws air over fi  lters that remove the particles.9 A Hi-Vol sampler for particles is Analysis of the Atmosphere and Air Pollutants 715
essentially a glorifi  ed vacuum cleaner that draws air through a fi  lter. The samplers are usually placed 
under a shelter which excludes precipitation and particles larger than about 0.1 mm in diameter, 
favoring collection of particles up to 25–50 mm diameter. These devices effi  ciently collect particles 
from a large volume of air, typically 2000 m3, and typically over a 24-h period (Figure 27.5).
The fi  lters used in a Hi-Vol sampler are usually composed of glass fi  bers and have a collection 
effi ciency of at least 99% for particles with 0.3 mm diameter. Particles with diameters exceeding 
100 mm remain on the fi  lter surface, whereas particles with diameters down to approximately 0.1 mm 
are collected on the glass fi  bers in the fi  lters. Effi  cient collection is achieved by using very small 
diameter fi  bers (<1 mm) for the fi  lter material.
The technique described here is most useful for determining total levels of particulate matter. 
Prior to taking the sample, the fi  lter is maintained at 15–35°C at 50% relative humidity for 24 h, 
then weighed. After sampling for 24 h, the fi  lter is removed and equilibrated for 24 h under the same 
conditions used prior to its installation on the sampler. The fi  lter is then weighed and the quantity of 
particulate matter per unit volume of air is calculated.
The range over which particulate matter can be measured is approximately 2–750 mg/m3, where 
volume is expressed at 25°C and 1 atm (760 mm Hg, 101 kPa) pressure. The lower limit is deter-
mined by limitations in measuring mass, and the upper limit by limited fl  ow rate when the fi  lter 
becomes clogged.
Size separation of particles can be achieved by fi  ltration through successively smaller fi  lters in a 
stacked fi  lter unit . Another approach uses the virtual impactor , a combination of an air fi  lter and an 
impactor (discussed below). In the virtual impactor, the gas stream being sampled is forced to 
make a sharp bend. Particles larger than about 2.5 mm do not make the bend and are collected on a 
fi lter. The remaining gas stream is then fi  ltered to remove smaller particles. A similar approach is 
the basis for a reference method for the collection of particulate matter with an aerodynamic 
 diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 mm, PM10.10 As discussed in Chapter 10, small particu-
late matter is of special concern because of its respirability and other properties. This has led to the 
defi nition of another category of particulate matter, PM2.5, consisting of particles having an aero-
dynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 2.5 mm. To determine PM2.5, ambient air is drawn 
into an inertial particle size separator and the PM2.5 particles are collected on a polytetrafl  uoro-
ethylene (PTFE) fi  lter for weighing over a period of about 24 h.11 The lower detection limit of the 
method is about 2 mg/m3.
Results obtained by the analysis of particulate matter collected by fi  lters should be treated with 
some caution. A number of reactions may occur on the fi  lter and during the process of removing the 
sample from the fi  lter. This can cause serious misinterpretation of data. For example, volatile par-
ticulate matter may be lost from the fi  lter. Furthermore, because of chemical reactions on the fi  lter, 
the material analyzed may not be the material that was collected. Artifact particulate matter  forms

from the oxidation of acid gases on alkaline glass fi  bers. This is a major problem with sulfur dioxide 
retained and oxidized to sulfate, especially on alkaline fi  lters. Artifact particulate matter gives an 
exaggerated value of particulate matter concentration.
27.9.2  COLLECTION  BY IMPACTORS
Impactors  cause a relatively high velocity gas stream to undergo a sharp bend such that particles are 
collected on a surface impacted by the stream. The device may be called a dry or wet impactor 
depending upon whether collecting surface is dry or wet; wet surfaces aid particle retention. Size 
segregation can be achieved with an impactor because larger particles are preferentially impacted, 
and smaller particles continue in the gas stream. The cascade impactor, accomplishes size separa-
tion by directing the gas stream onto a series of collection slides through successively smaller 
 orifi ces, which yield successively higher gas velocities. Particles may break up into smaller pieces 
from the impact of impingement; therefore, in some cases impingers yield erroneously high values 
for levels of smaller particles.
One of the major diffi  culties in particle analysis is the lack of suitable fi  lter material. Different 
fi lter materials serve very well for specifi  c applications, but none is satisfactory for all applications. 
Fiber fi  lters composed of polystyrene are very good for elemental analysis because of low back-
ground levels of inorganic materials. However, they are not useful for organic analysis. Glass-fi  ber 
fi lters have good weighing qualities and are therefore very useful for determining total particle 
concentration; however, metals, silicates, sulfates, and other species are readily leached from the 
fi ne glass fi  bers, introducing error into analysis for inorganic pollutant analysis.
27.9.3  PARTICLE  ANALYSIS
A number of chemical analysis techniques can be used to characterize atmospheric particulate 
 pollutants.12 These include atomic absorption, inductively coupled plasma techniques, x-ray fl  uore-
scence, neutron activation analysis, and ion-selective electrodes for fl  uoride analysis. Chemical 
microscopy is an  extremely useful technique for the characterization of atmospheric particles. Either 
visible or electron microscopy may be employed. Particle morphology and shape tell the experien-
ced microscopist a great deal about the material being examined. Refl  ection, refraction, microche-
mical tests, and other  techniques may be employed to further characterize the materials being 
examined. Microscopy may be used for  determining levels of specifi  c kinds of particles and for 
determining particle size.
27.9.4  X-R AY FLUORESCENCE
X-ray fl  uorescence is another multielement analysis technique that can be applied to a wide variety of 
environmental samples. It is especially useful for the characterization of atmospheric particulate matter, 
but it can be applied to some water and soil samples as well. This technique is based upon measurement 
of x-rays emitted when electrons fall back into inner shell vacancies created by  bombardment with 
 energetic x-rays, gamma radiation, or protons. The emitted x-rays have an energy characteristic of the 
particular atom. The wavelength (energy) of the emitted radiation yields a  qualitative analysis of the 
elements, and the intensity of radiation from a particular element provides a quantitative analysis. A 
schematic diagram of a wavelength-dispersive x-ray fl  uorescence  spectrophotometer is shown in 
Figure 27.6. An excitation source, normally an x-ray tube emitting “white” x-rays (a continuum), produ-
ces a primary beam of energetic radiation which excites fl  uorescent x-rays in the sample. A radioactive 
source emitting gamma rays or protons from an accelerator may also be used for excitation. For best 
results, the sample should be mounted as a thin layer, which means that segments of air fi  lters containing 
fi ne  particulate matter make ideal samples. The fl  uorescent x-rays are passed through a collimator to 
select a parallel secondary beam, which is dispersed according to wavelength by diffraction with a Analysis of the Atmosphere and Air Pollutants 717
 crystal  monochromator. The monochromatic x-rays in the secondary beam are counted by a detector 
which rotates at a degree twice that of the crystal to scan the spectrum of emitted radiation. 
Energy-selective detectors of the Si(Li) semiconductor type enable measurement of fl  uorescent 
x-rays of different energies without the need for wavelength dispersion. Instead, the energies of 
a number of lines falling on a detector simultaneously are distinguished electronically. An energy-
dispersive x-ray fl  uorescence spectrum from an atmospheric particulate sample is shown in 
Figure 27.7. A signifi  cant advantage of x-ray fl  uorescence multielement analysis is that sensitivities 
and detection limits do not vary greatly across the periodic table as they do with methods such as 
neutron activation analysis or atomic absorption. Proton-excited x-ray emission is particularly 
sensitive.
27.9.5  DETERMINATION  OF LEAD IN PARTICULATE  MATTER
Because of its toxicity, widespread industrial use, and former use in gasoline, lead is one of the most 
important contaminants in atmospheric particulate matter. The U.S. EPA specifi  es a method for the 
determination of lead in atmospheric particulate matter.13 Lead collected from the atmosphere is FIGURE 27.6 Wavelength-dispersive x-ray fl  uorescence spectrophotometer.

27.10  DIRECT SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF GASEOUS 
AIR POLLUTANTS
From the foregoing discussion, it is obvious that measurement techniques that depend upon the use 
of chemical reagents, particularly liquids, are cumbersome and complicated. It is a tribute to the 
ingenuity of instrument designers that such techniques are being applied successfully to  atmospheric 
pollutant monitoring. Direct spectrophotometric techniques are much more desirable when they are 
available and when they are capable of accurate analysis at the low levels required. One such 
 technique, nondispersive infrared spectrophotometry, was described in Section 27.7 for the analysis 
of carbon monoxide. Three other direct spectrophotometric methods are FTIR spectroscopy, tunable 
diode laser spectroscopy, and differential optical absorption spectroscopy. These techniques may be 
used for point air monitoring, in which a sample is monitored at a given point, generally by measure-
ment in a long absorption cell. In-stack monitoring may be performed to measure effl  uents. A 
fi nal possibility is the collection of long-line data (sometimes using sunlight as a radiation source), 
 yielding concentrations in units of concentration-length (ppm-m). If the path length is known, the 
concentration may be calculated. This approach is particularly useful for measuring concentrations 
in stack plumes.
The low levels of typical air constituents require long path lengths, sometimes up to several 
 kilometers, for spectroscopic measurements. These may be achieved by locating the radiation source 
some distance from the detector, by the use of a distant retrorefl  ector to refl  ect the radiation back to 
the vicinity of the source, or by cells in which a beam is refl  ected multiple times to achieve a long 
path length.
A typical open-path FTIR system for remote monitoring of air pollutants uses a single unit 
 (telescope) that functions as both a transmitter and receiver of infrared radiation (Figure 27.8). The 
radiation is generated by a silicon carbide glower, modulated by a Michaelson inteferometer, and 
transmitted to a retrorefl  ector, which refl  ects it back to the telescope where its intensity is measured. 
The modulated infrared signal, called an inteferogram, is processed by a mathematical algorithm, 
the Fourier transform, to give a spectrum of the absorbing substances. This spectrum is fi  tted 
 mathematically to spectra of the absorbing species to give their concentrations.
Dispersive absorption spectrometers are basically standard spectrometers with a monochromator 
for selection of the wavelength to be measured. They are used to measure air pollutants by 
 determining absorption at a specifi  ed part of the spectrum of the sought-for material. Of course, 
other gases or particulate matter that absorb or scatter light at the chosen wavelength interfere.

These instruments are generally applied to in-stack monitoring. Sensitivity is increased by using 
long path lengths or by pressurizing the cell.
Second-derivative spectroscopy is a useful technique for trace gas analysis. Basically, this 
 technique varies the wavelength by a small value around a specifi  ed nominal wavelength. The 
 s e c o n d  d e r i v a t i v e  o f  l i g h t  i n t e n s i t y  v e r s u s  w a v e l e n g t h  i s  o b t a i n e d .  I n  c o n v e n t i o n a l  a b s o r p t i o n  
 spectrophotometry, a decrease in light intensity as the light passes through a sample indicates the 
presence of at least one substance—and possibly many—absorbing at that wavelength. Second-
derivative spectroscopy, however, provides information regarding the change in intensity with 
 wavelength, thereby indicating the presence of specifi  c absorption lines or bands which may be 
superimposed on a  relatively high background of absorption. Much higher specifi  city is obtained. 
The spectra obtained by second-derivative spectrometry in the ultraviolet region show a great deal 
of structure and are quite characteristic of the compounds being observed.
Lidar , which stands for light detection and ranging (analogous to radar, radio detection and rang-
ing), is fi  nding numerous applications in atmospheric monitoring. Lidar systems send short pulses 
of light or infrared radiation into the atmosphere and collect radiation scattered back from mole-
cules or particles in the atmosphere. Computer analysis of the signal enables measurement of spe-
cies in the atmosphere.
Differential absorption lidar  uses two different laser wavelengths, one of which is absorbed by 
the analyte molecules and the other of which is not. The intensity difference of the two return 
 signals provides a measure of the analyte concentration.
Target velocities can be measured by Doppler lidar . Target molecules moving toward the  detector 
exhibit slightly reduced wavelengths in the return signal (blue shift) and those moving away give 
slightly longer wavelengths (red shift). This technique is very useful for the analysis of aerosol 
 particles and, since these are carried at the essentially the same velocity as the wind, it provides a 
remote measurement of wind velocity.

Materials and Xenobiotics
28.1 INTRODUCTION
As defi  ned in Chapter 23, Section 23.5, a xenobiotic species is one that is foreign to living systems. 
Common examples include heavy metals, such as lead, that serve no physiologic function, and 
 synthetic organic compounds that are not  natural. Exposure of organisms to xenobiotic materials is 
a very important consideration in environmental and toxicological chemistry. Therefore, the deter-
mination of exposure by various analytical techniques is one of the more crucial aspects of environ-
mental chemistry.
This chapter deals with the determination of xenobiotic substances in biological materials. 
Although such substances can be measured in a variety of tissues, the greatest concern is their 
 presence in human tissues and other samples of human origin. Therefore, the methods described in 
this chapter apply primarily to exposed human subjects. They are essentially identical to methods 
used on other animals and, in fact, most were developed through animal studies. Signifi  cantly, 
 different techniques may be required for plant or microbiological samples.
The measurement of xenobiotic substances and their metabolites in blood, urine, breath, and 
other samples of biological origin to determine exposure to toxic substances is called biological 
monitoring . Comparison of the levels of analytes measured with the degree and type of exposure to 
foreign substances is a crucial aspect of toxicological chemistry. It is an area in which rapid advances 
are being made. A complete reference on standardized methods for laboratory analysis practiced by 
clinical toxicologists confi  rming to standards stipulated by the International Standards Organization 
(ISO) was published in 2009.1 Several books on biological monitoring such as those by Angerer, 
Draper, Baselt, and Kneip and coauthors are listed at the end of this chapter under “supplementary 
references.”
The two main approaches to workplace monitoring of toxic chemicals are workplace monitoring, 
using samplers that sample xenobiotic substances from workplace air, and biological monitoring. 
Although the analyses are generally much more diffi  cult, biological monitoring is a much better 
indicator of exposure because it measures exposure through all routes—oral and dermal as well as 
inhalation—and it gives an integrated value of exposure. Furthermore, biological monitoring is very 
useful in determining the effectiveness of measures taken to prevent exposure, such as protective 
clothing and hygienic measures.
28.2 INDICATORS OF EXPOSURE TO XENOBIOTICS
Biological markers  or biomarkers  refer to evidence used to monitor exposure, effects, and recovery 
from effects of xenobiotic substances. They (1) provide confi  rmation of exposure, (2) enable assess-
ment of ill effects, and (3) provide evidence of an individual’s response to exposure. Effects on the 724 Environmental Chemistry
liver are especially useful as biomarkers because of the liver’s key role in xenobiotic metabolism and 
its response to virtually all toxicants. In dealing with toxic substances, the liver often suffers dam-
age, including cell death, lesions, fat abnormalities (fatty liver), impairment of bile fl  ow, and vascu-
lar disorders. Prominent among the indicators of liver damage from toxicants are proteins indicating 
such damage that occur in blood (serum and plasma) and urine.
The two major considerations in determining exposure to xenobiotics are the type of sample and 
the type of analyte. Both of these are infl  uenced by what happens to a xenobiotic material when it 
gets into the body. For some exposures, the entry site composes the sample. This is the case, for 
example, in exposure to asbestos fi  bers in the air, which is manifested by lesions to the lung. More 
commonly, the analyte may appear at some distance from the site of exposure, such as lead in bone 
that was originally taken in by the respiratory route. In other cases, the original xenobiotic is not 
even present in the analyte. An example of this is methemoglobin in blood, the result of exposure to 
aniline absorbed through the skin.
The two major kinds of samples analyzed for xenobiotics exposure are blood and urine. Both 
these samples are analyzed for systemic xenobiotics , which are those that are transported in the 
body and metabolized in various tissues. Xenobiotic substances and their metabolites and adducts 
are absorbed into the body and transported through the bloodstream. Therefore, blood is of unique 
importance as a sample for biological monitoring. Blood is not a simple sample to process, and 
subjects often object to the process of taking it. Upon collection, blood may be treated with an anti-
coagulant, usually a salt of EDTA, and processed for analysis as whole blood. It may also be allowed 
to clot and be centrifuged to remove solids; the liquid remaining is blood serum. 
Recall from Chapter 22 that as the result of Phase I and Phase II reactions, xenobiotics tend to be 
converted to more polar and water-soluble metabolites. These are eliminated with the urine, making 
urine a good sample to analyze as evidence of exposure to xenobiotic substances. Urine has the 
advantage of being a simpler matrix than blood and one that subjects more readily give for analysis. 
Other kinds of samples that may be analyzed include breath (for volatile xenobiotics and volatile 
metabolites), hair or nails (for trace elements, such as selenium), adipose tissue (fat), and milk (obvi-
ously limited to lactating females). Various kinds of organ tissue can be analyzed in cadavers, which 
can be useful in trying to determine the cause of death by poisoning.
The choice of the analyte actually measured varies with the xenobiotic substance to which the 
subject has been exposed. Therefore, it is convenient to divide xenobiotic analysis on the basis of 
the type of chemical species determined. The most straightforward analyte is, of course, the xeno-
biotic itself. This applies to elemental xenobiotics, especially metals, which are almost always deter-
mined in the elemental form. In a few cases, organic xenobiotics can also be determined as the 
parent compound. However, organic xenobiotics are commonly metabolized to other products by 
Phase I and Phase II reactions. Usually, the Phase I reaction product is measured, often after it is 
hydrolyzed from the Phase II conjugate, using enzymes or acid hydrolysis procedures. Thus, for 
example, trans ,trans -muconic acid can be measured as evidence of exposure to the parent com-
pound benzene. In other cases, a Phase II reaction product is measured; for example, hippuric acid 
i s  d e t e r m i n e d  a s  e v i d e n c e  o f  e x p o s u r e  t o  t o l u e n e .  S o m e  x e n o b i o t i c s  o r  t h e i r  m e t a b o l i t e s  f o r m  
adducts with endogenous materials in the body, which are then measured as evidence of exposure. 
A simple example is the adduct formed between carbon monoxide and hemoglobin, namely carboxy-
hemoglobin. More complicated examples are the adducts formed by the carcinogenic Phase I reac-
tion products of PAHs with DNA or hemoglobin. Another class of analytes consists of endo genous 
substances produced on exposure to a xenobiotic material. Methemoglobin formed as a result of 
exposure to nitrobenzene, aniline, and related compounds is an example of such a substance that 
does not contain any of the original xenobiotic material but is formed as the result of exposure to a 
toxic substance. Another class of substance causes measurable alterations in enzyme activity. The 
most common example of this is the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase enzyme by organophosphates 
or carbamate insecticides.Analysis of Biological Materials and Xenobiotics 725
28.3 DETERMINATION OF METALS
28.3.1  DIRECT ANALYSIS  OF METALS
Several biologically important metals can be determined directly in body fl  uids, especially urine, 
by atomic absorption. In the simplest cases, the urine is diluted with water or with acid and a portion 
analyzed directly by graphite furnace atomic absorption, taking advantage of the very high sensitiv-
ity of that technique for some metals. Metals that can be determined directly in urine by this 
approach include chromium, copper, lead, lithium, and zinc. Very low levels of metals can be mea-
sured using a graphite furnace atomic absorption technique, and Zeeman background correction 
with a graphite furnace enables measurement of metals in samples that contain enough biological 
material to cause signifi  cant amounts of “smoke” during the atomization process, so that ashing the 
samples is less necessary.
A variety of metals may be determined in blood and serum simply diluted with appropriate 
reagents such as ammonia, TritonX-100 surfactant, and EDTA using inductively coupled plasma 
atomization with mass spectrometric detection. This procedure enables analyses giving adequate 
detection limits for the measurement of cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, rubidium, and zinc.
28.3.2 M ETALS IN WET-ASHED BLOOD AND URINE
Several toxicologically important metals are readily determined from wet-ashed blood or urine using 
atomic spectroscopic techniques. The ashing procedure may vary, but always entails heating the 
sample with strong acid and oxidant to dryness and redissolving the residue in acid. A typical proce-
dure is digestion of blood or urine for cadmium analysis, which consists of mixing the sample with a 
comparable volume of concentrated nitric acid, heating to a reduced volume, adding 30% hydrogen 
peroxide oxidant, heating to dryness, and dissolving in nitric acid prior to measurement by atomic 
absorption or emission. Mixtures of nitric, sulfuric, and perchloric acid are effective although they 
are somewhat hazardous media for digesting blood, urine, or tissue. Wet ashing followed by atomic 
absorption analysis can be used for the determination in blood or urine of cadmium, chromium, cop-
per, lead, manganese, and zinc, among other metals. Although atomic absorption, especially highly 
sensitive graphite furnace atomic absorption, has long been favored for measuring metals in biologi-
cal samples, the multielement capability and other advantages of inductively coupled plasma atomic 
spectroscopy has led to its use for determining metals in blood and urine samples. 
28.3.3  EXTRACTION  OF METALS FOR ATOMIC  ABSORPTION  ANALYSIS
A number of procedures for the determination of metals and biological samples call for the extraction 
of the metal with an organic chelating agent in order to remove interferences and concentrate the 
metal to enable detection of low levels. The urine or blood sample may be fi  rst subjected to wet ash-
ing to enable extraction of the metal. Beryllium from an acid-digested blood or urine sample may 
be extracted by acetylacetone into methylisobutyl ketone prior to atomic absorption analysis. Almost 
all of the common metals can be determined by this approach using appropriate extractants.
The availability of strongly chelating extractant reagents for a number of metals has led to 
the development of procedures in which the metal is extracted from minimally treated blood or 
urine, then quantifi  ed by atomic absorption analysis. The metals for which such extractions can 
be used include cobalt, lead, and thallium extracted into organic solvent as the dithiocarbamate 
 chelate, and nickel extracted into methylisobutyl ketone as a chelate formed with ammonium 
pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate.
Several metals or metalloids are converted to a volatile form, usually hydrides, for analysis. 
Arsenic, antimony, and selenium can be reduced to AsH3, SbH3, and H2Se, respectively, which can 726 Environmental Chemistry
be determined by atomic absorption or other means. Mercury is reduced to a volatile metal, which 
is evolved from solution and measured by cold vapor atomic absorption.
28.4  DETERMINATION OF NONMETALS AND INORGANIC COMPOUNDS
Several nonmetals and nonmetallic species are determined in biological samples. One important 
example is fl  uoride, which occurs in biological fl  uids as the fl  uoride ion, F-. In some cases of occu-
pational exposure or exposure through food or drinking water, excessive levels of fl  uoride in the 
body can be a health concern. Fluoride is readily determined potentiometrically with a fl  uoride ion-
selective electrode. The sample is diluted with an appropriate buffer and the potential of the fl  uoride 
electrode measured very accurately versus a reference electrode, with the concentration calculated 
from a calibration plot. Even more accurate values can be obtained by the use of standard addition 
in which the potential of the electrode system in a known volume of sample is read, a measured 
amount of standard fl  uoride is added, and the shift in potential is used to calculate the unknown 
concentration of fl  uoride.
Another nonmetal for which a method of determining biological exposure would be useful is 
white phosphorus, the most common and relatively toxic elemental form. Unfortunately, there is no 
chemical method suitable for the determination of exposure to white phosphorus that would distin-
guish such exposure from relatively high background levels of organic and inorganic phosphorus in 
body fl  uids and tissues.
Toxic cyanide can be isolated in a special device called a Conway microdiffusion cell by treatment 
with acid, followed by collection of the weakly acidic HCN gas that is evolved in a base solution. The 
cyanide released can be measured spectrophotometrically by the formation of a colored species.
Carbon monoxide is readily determined in blood by virtue of the colored carboxyhemoglobin 
that it forms with hemoglobin. The procedure consists of measuring the absorbances at wavelengths 
of 414, 421, and 428 nm of the blood sample, a sample through which oxygen has been bubbled to 
change all the hemoglobin to the oxyhemoglobin form, and a sample through which carbon monox-
ide has been bubbled to change all the hemoglobin to carboxyhemoglobin. With the appropriate 
calculations, a percentage conversion to carboxyhemoglobin can be obtained.
28.5 DETERMINATION OF PARENT ORGANIC COMPOUNDS
A number of organic compounds can be measured as the unmetabolized compound in blood, urine, and 
breath. In some cases, the sample can be injected along with its water content directly into a gas chro-
matograph. Direct injection is used for the measurement of acetone, n-butanol, dimethylformamide, 
cyclopropane, halothane, methoxyfl  urane, diethyl ether, isopropanol, methanol, methyl n-butyl ketone, 
methyl chloride, methylethyl ketone, toluene, trichloroethane, and trichloroethylene.
For the determination of volatile compounds in blood or urine, a straightforward approach is to 
liberate the analyte at an elevated temperature, allowing the volatile compound to accumulate in 
headspace  above the sample followed by direct injection of the headspace gas into a gas chroma to-
graph. A reagent such as perchloric acid may be added to deproteinize the blood or urine sample 
and facilitate release of the volatile xenobiotic compound. Among the compounds determined by 
this approach are acetaldehyde, dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, benzene, 
trichloroethylene, toluene, cyclohexane, and ethylene oxide. The use of multiple detectors for the 
gas chromatographic determination of analytes in headspace increases the versatility of this tech-
nique and enables the determination of a variety of physiologically important volatile organic 
compounds.
Purge-and-trap techniques are those in which volatile analytes are evolved from blood or urine 
in a gas stream and collected on a trap for subsequent chromatographic analysis. Such techniques 
employing gas chromatographic separation and mass spectrometric detection can be used to deter-
mine a number of volatile organic compounds in blood, for example.Analysis of Biological Materials and Xenobiotics 727
28.6 MEASUREMENT OF PHASE I AND PHASE II REACTION PRODUCTS
28.6.1 P HASE I R EACTION  PRODUCTS
For a number of organic compounds, the most accurate indication of exposure is to be obtained by 
determining their Phase I reaction products. This is because many compounds are metabolized in 
the body and do not show up as the parent compound. And those fractions of volatile organic com-
pounds that are not metabolized may be readily eliminated with expired air from the lungs and may 
thus be missed. In cases where a signifi  cant fraction of the xenobiotic compound has undergone a 
Phase II reaction, the Phase I product may be regenerated by acid hydrolysis.
One of the compounds commonly determined as its Phase I metabolite is benzene, which under-
goes the following reactions in the body (see Chapter 24, Section 24.4):

Therefore, exposure to benzene can be determined by analysis of urine for phenol. Although a 
very sensitive colorimetric method for phenol involving diazotized p-nitroaniline has long been 
available, gas chromatographic analysis is now favored. The urine sample is treated with perchloric 
acid to hydrolyze phenol conjugates and the phenol is extracted into diisopropyl ether for chroma-
tographic analysis. Two other metabolic products of benzene, trans ,trans -muconic acid, and S-phenyl 
mercapturic acid are now commonly measured as more specifi  c biomarkers of benzene exposure.

Insecticidal carbaryl undergoes the metabolic reaction shown in Reaction 28.2. Therefore, the 
analysis of 1-naphthol in urine indicates exposure to carbaryl. The 1-naphthol that is conjugated by 
a Phase II reaction is liberated by acid hydrolysis, and is then determined spectrophotometrically or 
by chromatography

In addition to the examples discussed above, a number of other xenobiotics are measured by their 
Phase I reaction products. These compounds and their metabolites are listed in Table 28.1. These 
methods are used for determining metabolites in urine. Normally the urine sample is acidifi  ed to 
release the Phase I metabolites from the Phase II conjugates that they might have formed and, except 
where direct sample injection is employed, the analyte is collected as vapor or extracted into an 
organic solvent. In some cases, the analyte is reacted with a reagent that produces a volatile deriva-
tive that is readily separated and detected by gas chromatography.728 Environmental Chemistry
28.6.2  PHASE II R EACTION  PRODUCTS
Hippuric acids, which are formed as Phase II metabolic products from toluene, xylenes, benzoic 
acid, ethylbenzene, and closely related compounds, can be determined as biological markers of 
exposure. The formation of hippuric acid from toluene is shown in Chapter 23, Figure 23.2, and the

Exposure to toluene can be detected by extracting hippuric acid from acidifi  ed urine into diethyl 
ether/isopropanol and direct ultraviolet absorbance measurement of the extracted acid at 230 nm. 
Potentially, methylhippuric acid can be measured in urine as evidence of exposure to xylenes. 
However, when the analysis is designed to detect the xylenes, ethylbenzene, and related compounds, 
several metabolites related to hippuric acid may be formed and the ultraviolet spectrometric method 
lacks specifi  city. To improve specifi  city, the various acids produced from these compounds can be 
extracted from acidifi  ed urine into ethyl acetate, derivatized to produce volatile species, and quanti-
fi ed by gas chromatography.
A disadvantage in measuring toluene exposure by hippuric acid is the production of this metabo-
lite from natural sources other than toluene, and the determination of tolulylmercapturic acid is now 
favored as a biomarker of toluene exposure. An interesting sidelight is that dietary habits can cause 
uncertainties in the measurement of xenobiotic metabolites. An example of this is the measurement 
of exposure of workers to 3-chloropropene by the production of allylmercapturic acid. This metabo-
lite is also produced by garlic, and garlic consumption by workers can be a confounding factor in the 
method. Thiocyanate monitored as evidence of exposure to cyanide is increased markedly by the 
consumption of cooked cassava!
28.6.3 M ERCAPTURATES
Mercapturates have proven to be very useful Phase II reaction products for measuring exposure to 
xenobiotics, especially because of the sensitive determination of these substances by HPLC separa-
tion, and fl  uorescence detection of their o-phthaldialdehyde derivatives. In addition to toluene men-
tioned above, the xenobiotics for which mercapturates may be monitored include styrene, structurally 
similar to toluene; acrylonitrile; allyl chloride; atrazine; butadiene; and epichlorohydrin.
The formation of mercapturates or mercapturic acid derivatives by metabolism of xenobiotics is 
the result of Phase II conjugation by glutathione. Glutathione  (commonly abbreviated GSH) is a 
crucial conjugating agent in the body. This compound is a tripeptide, meaning that it is composed 
of three amino acids linked together. These amino acids and their abbreviations are glutamic acid 
(Glu), cysteine (Cys), and glycine (Gly). The formula of GSH may be represented as illustrated in 
Figure 28.1, where the SH is shown specifi  cally because of its crucial role in forming the covalent 
link to a xenobiotic compound. GSH conjugate may be excreted directly, although this is rare. More 
commonly, the GSH conjugate undergoes further biochemical reactions that produce mercapturic 
acids (compounds with N-acetylcysteine attached) or other species. The specifi  c mercapturic acids 
can be monitored as biological markers of exposure to the xenobiotic species that result in their 
formation. The overall process for the production of mercapturic acids as applied to a generic xeno-
biotic species, HX-R (see previous discussion), is illustrated in Figure 28.1.
An interesting application of mercapturate analysis for ingestion of specifi  c compounds is the 
measurement of S-allylmercapturic acid (structural formula below) in urine as a biomarker of inges-
tion of garlic for health reasons. The precursor to this compound is g-glutamyl-S-allyl-l-cysteine 
that occurs naturally in garlic.

28.7 DETERMINATION OF ADDUCTS
Determination of adducts is often a useful and elegant means of measuring exposure to xenobiotics. 
Adducts, as the name implies, are substances produced when xenobiotic substances add to endogenous 730 Environmental Chemistry
chemical species. The measurement of carbon monoxide from its hemoglobin adduct w as discussed in 
Section 28.4. In general, adducts are produced when a relatively simple xenobiotic molecule adds to 
a large macromolecular biomolecule that is naturally present in the body. The fact that adduct 
 formation is a mode of toxic action, such as that occurs in the methylation of DNA during carcino-
genesis (Chapter 23, Section 23.8), makes adduct measurement as a means of biolog ical monitoring 
even more pertinent.
Adducts to hemoglobin are perhaps the most useful means of biological monitoring by adduct 
formation. Hemoglobin is, of course, present in blood, which is the most accurate type of sample for 
biological monitoring. Adducts to blood plasma albumin are also useful monitors and have been 
applied to the determination of exposure to toluene diisocyanate, benzo(a)pyrene, styrene, styrene 
oxide, and afl  atoxin B1.
The DNA adduct of styrene oxide has been measured to indicate exposure to carcinogenic styrene 
oxide. Another example of how DNA adducts can be measured as evidence of xenobiotic exposure 
i s  p r o v i d e d  b y  t h e  t o b a c c o - s p e c i fi  c carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1- butanone, 
which is activated by metabolic processes and adds to deoxyguanosine in DNA to give the guanine 
adduct, O6-[1-oxo-1-(3-pyridyl)but-4-yl]dGuo, as shown in Figure 28.2. Measurement of this adduct 
by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS) or LC/ESI-
tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS) can provide evidence of exposure to the carcinogen.
One disadvantage of biological monitoring by adduct formation can be the relatively complicated 
procedures and expensive, specialized instruments required. Lysing red blood cells may be required 
to release the hemoglobin adducts, derivatization may be necessary, and the measurements of the 
fi nal analyte species can require relatively sophisticated instrumental techniques. Despite these 
complexities, the measurement of hemoglobin adducts is emerging as a method of choice for a 
 number of xenobiotics including acrylamide, acrylonitrile, 1,3-butadiene, 3,3 ¢-dichlorobenzidine, 
ethylene oxide, and hexahydrophthalic anhydride.
28.8 THE PROMISE OF IMMUNOLOGICAL METHODS
As discussed in Chapter 26, Section 26.6, immunoassay methods offer distinct advantages in speci-
fi city, selectivity, simplicity, and costs. Although used in simple test kits for blood glucose and FIGURE 28.1  GSH conjugate of a xenobiotic species (HX-R) followed by formation of GSH and cysteine

pregnancy testing, immunoassay methods have been limited in biological monitoring of xenobiot-
ics, in part because of interferences in complex biological systems. Because of their inherent advan-
ta g e s ,  h o w e v e r ,  i t  c an  be  an ti c i p a ted  th a t  imm un o as s a y s  will  gr o w  in  im po rtan ce  f o r  b i o l o gi c al  
moni torin g o f x enobi oti cs. As an e xamp l e o f such an app li cati on, PCB s ha v e been measured in 
blood plasma by immunoassays. Methods have been developed for the immunoassay of cyanobacte-
rial toxins (saxitoxins, microcystins, and nodularins) in biological samples.
Calves are aborted from pregnant cows that ingest isocupressic acid by eating vegetation from 
lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, common juniper, and Monterey cypress. As evidence of exposure 
to this toxic agent, an immunoassay has been developed that responds to the abortifacient agent as 
well as its major metabolites, agathic acid, dihydroagathic acid, and tetrahydroagathic acid 
(Figure 28.3).2 The method can be used to determine these compounds in both blood serum and 
urine of cattle.
In addition to immunoassay measurement of xenobiotics and their metabolites, immunological 
techniques can be used for the separation of analytes from complex biological samples employing 
immobilized antibodies. This approach has been used to isolate afl  atoxicol from urine and enable its 
determination along with afl  atoxins B1, B2, G1, G2, M1, and Q1 using high-performance liquid 
chromatography and postcolumn derivatization/fl  uorescence detection.3 A monoclonal antibody 
reactive with S-phenylmercapturic acid, an important Phase II reaction product of benzene resulting 
from GSH conjugation, has been generated from an appropriate hapten–protein conjugate. The 
immobilized antibody has been used in a column to enrich S-phenylmercapturic acid from the 
urine of workers exposed to benzene.4 Signifi  cantly, more such applications can be anticipated in 
future years.FIGURE 28.2 Formation of a DNA adduct from 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, a

QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS
 1. Personnel monitoring in the workplace is commonly practiced with vapor samplers that 
workers carry around. How does this differ from biological monitoring? In what respects 
is biological monitoring superior?
 2. Why is blood arguably the best kind of sample for biological monitoring? What are some 
of the disadvantages of blood in terms of sampling and sample processing? What are 
some disadvantages of blood as a matrix for analysis? What are the advantages of urine? 
Discuss why urine might be the kind of sample most likely to show metabolites and least 
likely to show parent species.
 3. Distinguish among the following kinds of analytes measured for biological monitoring: 
parent compound, Phase I reaction product, Phase II reaction product, adducts.
 4. What is wet ashing? For what kinds of analytes is wet ashing of blood commonly  performed? 
What kinds of reagents are used for wet ashing, and what are some of the special safety 
 precautions that should be taken with the use of these kinds of reagents for wet ashing?
 5. What species is commonly measured potentiometrically in biological monitoring?
 6. Compare the analysis of Phase I and Phase II metabolic products for biological monitoring. 
How are Phase II products converted back to Phase I metabolites for analysis?
 7. Which biomolecule is most commonly involved in the formation of adducts for biological 
monitoring? What is the problem with measuring adducts for biological monitoring?
 8. What are the two general uses of immunology in biological monitoring? What is the 
 disadvantage of immunological techniques? Discuss the likelihood that immunological 
techniques will fi  nd increasing use in the future as a means of biological monitoring.
 9. The determination of DNA adducts is a favored means of measuring exposure to carcinogens. 
Based on what is known about the mechanism of carcinogenicity, why would this method 
be favored? What might be some limitations of measuring DNA adducts as evidence of 
exposure to carcinogens?
 10. How are mercapturic acid conjugates formed? What special role do they play in biological 
monitoring? What advantage do they afford in terms of measurement?
 11. For what kinds of xenobiotics are trichloroacetic acid measured? Suggest the pathways by 
which these compounds might form trichloroacetic acid metabolically.
 12. Match each xenobiotic species from the column on the left with the analyte that is measured 
in its biological monitoring from the column on the right.
1. Methanol a. Mandelic acid
2. Malathion b. A diketone
3. Styrene c. Organic phosphates
4. Nitrobenzene d. Formic acid
5. n-Heptane e. p-Nitrophenol
 13. From the examples given in Section 28.8, it appears that immunological methods for xeno-
biotic analysis are favored for moderately complex molecules of biological origin. Suggest 
why this may be so. What do you think could be the major advantages and disadvantages 
of immunological methods?
 14. The response of a fl  uoride ion-selective electrode obeys a Nernstian equation
 E  = Ea - 59.2 log[F-]
  where E is the measured potential of the electrode versus a reference electrode in millivolts 
(mv), Ea is a constant for a given electrode system, and [F-] is the concentration of fl  uoride ions 
in mol/L (M). An analyst placed a fl  uoride electrode and a reference electrode in 100 mL of a 
urine sample and set E to zero. Addition of 100 mL of a 1.00 ¥ 10-4 M  standard F- solution 
shifted the reading of E to - 15.0 mv. What was the concentration of F- in the sample?735Index
