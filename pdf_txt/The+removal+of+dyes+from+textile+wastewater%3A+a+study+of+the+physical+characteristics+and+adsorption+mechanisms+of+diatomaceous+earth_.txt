INVESTIGATION OF THE POSSIBILITY OF PRACTICAL USE OF DIATOMIT  
FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT  
The article is dedicated to the  study of the practical application of diatomite for wastewater treatment. We 
have noted that in order to increase the efficiency of wastewater treatment by diatomite, it is nece ssary to 
choose such values of the average diameter of the rock particles at w hich the optimal values of permeability 
and adsorption are concurrently achieved. We have found that as the temperature of calcination of di atomite 
increases, its permeability increases, since the average diameter of the diatomite particles increas es. The 
value of adsorption of dissolved substances from the aqueous solution decreases due to an increase i n the 
number of water molecules which are adsorbed from the solution on the surface of diatomite. It was f ound 
that when water is absorbed by calcined diato mite samples on the diatomite surface occurs the hydrolysis of 
reactive siloxane bonds that causes increase in the solubility of silica and decrease in the number of active 
adsorption sites on the diatomite surface. Basing on the data obtained, we have dev eloped recommendations 
for the practical application of diatomite for wastewater treatment.  
Key words: diatomite, permeability, adsorption, water absorption, silica solubility, treatment, waste water .
