Abstract   
The study was designed for isolation and characterization of azo dye decolourizing bacteria which is a 
prerequisite for developing a microorganism -facilitated treatment of polluting dyes. In this study nine types of 
bacteria which were able to decolourize three types of azo dyes (Blue H/C, Red 3B and Yellow 3R dye) were 
isolated from textile effluents collected from Gazipur industrial area in Bangladesh. Depending on 16S rDNA analysis, the most efficient decolourizing bacterium for the Blue H/C and the Red 3B dye was identified as 
Alcaligenesfaecalis  strain E5.Cd  while that for the Yellow 3R dye was identified as Alcaligenesfaecalis  strain 
Fal.3. After characterization, both A. faecalis  E5.Cd and A. faecalis  Fal.3 were found to grow optimally at 3 5 
0C 
and at pH 7 and pH 8, respectively. Both of these strains were sensitive to all antibiotics studied except for Bacitracin. Also, both strains showed maximum decolourization activities after 96 hours incubation in MS 
media at pH 7 (up to 93%) and pH 8 (up to 94%), at 35 
0C temperature ( up to 91%), at 50 ppm initial dye 
concentration (up to 92%), at 20% inoculum size (up to 93%), and at supplementation of 1% co- substrate (up to 
93%).

 1. Introduction  
Large amount of effluents which is directly released in environment from the different industries without any 
proper treatment is now considering as a major threat to environment. In Bangladesh, dye- containing effluents 
released from textile and dyeing ind ustries is one of the major sources of environment pollution [1, 2] . It is 
reported that different industries discharge around 280,000 tons of dyes per year into the environment 
worldwide [3]. Azo dyes, which are aromatic compounds with one or more ( –N=N– ) groups, are the most  
significant and major class of synthetic dyes discharged from various industries [4]. It has been reported that 
around one million tons of Azo dyes are produced annually  for using commercial purposes worldwide [5]. 
Moreover, the dyes which are used in textiles and d yeing industries are mostly synthetic in nature that makes 
them more stable in nature and more challenging for biodegradation by natural process [6, 7] . Notably, very 
little amount of dye in water (10 -50 mg L -1) can adversely affects different physical parameters of aquatic 
environment such as transparency and gas solubility of  water, and the aesthetic value resulting in reduced 
dissolved oxygen and light intensity which ultimately affect the aquatic biodiversity [3]. It has been reported 
that textile dy es can adversely affect germination rates and biomass concentration of several plant species [3]. 
Moreover, these dyes are xenobiotic in nature as well as are mutagenic and carcino genic in some circumstances 
[8, 9] . Similarly, allergic effects of these dyes have also been shown by many studies [10, 11] . Hence, treatment 
of dye -conta minated effluents prior to their final discharge is essential to prevent environment pollution. 
Recently, many scientific research have been focused on developing microorganism -facilitated treatment 
method for degradation of textile dyes [12] . To develop a microorganism -facilitated treatment, establishment of 
a pure culture of microorganism possessing high efficacy of biodegradation of dyes into colourless and nontoxic 
components is a prer equisite [13-17]. Hence, the present  study was designed to establish pure cultures of 
bacteria having higher ability to degrade azo dye. Among the 9 pure cultures of azo dye decolourizing bacteria 
isolated from textile effluents, the most efficient decolourizing bacteria was Alcaligenes faec alis E5.Cd  (IBR -5) 
for the Blue H/C and Red 3B dye , and that was  A. faecalis  Fal.3 (IY -3) for the Yellow 3R dye. However, 
different strains of A. faecalis  such as A. faecalis  SAG 5 [18] and A. faecalis  PMS -1 [19] were reported for their 
decolourization efficacy, but A. faecalis  E5.Cd  and A. faecalis  Fal.3  were novel regarding their higher ability for 
decolourization studied azo dyes. Moreover, their decolourization activities were dependent on incubatio n 
temperature, pH, initial dye concentration, inoculum size and amount of co -substrate used in culture medium.  
2. Materials and Methods  
2.1 Source of the sample and dyes  
Effluents samples were collected in sterile plastic bottles from drainage canal of different Textile Dyeing Industries located in Gazipur, Bangladesh. Three azo dyes namely Blue H/C, Red 3B and Yellow 3R which 
were procured from Dysin- Chem Limited, Dhaka, Bangladesh were used in the present experiment .  
2.2 Enrichment and isolation of dye decolourizing bacteria  
All samples (untreated  textile effluents) were used for isolation of dye decolourizing bacterial cultures by American Scientific  Research Journal for Engineering, Technology, and Sciences (ASRJETS ) (2017 ) Volume 31, No  1, pp 163 -175

 enrichment culture techniques using e nrichment medium amended with 20 ppm of the test dyes (Blue H/C, Red 
3B and Yellow 3R) for the adaptation of the microorganisms [7]. For this,  1ml of sample of textile effluent was 
first diluted with 9ml sterilized water in test tubes separately. Then, 1ml of diluted sample was transferred into 
each single test tube containing 9 ml autoclaved enrichment medium. Required amount of respective dye was 
added to adjust the concentration 20 ppm and incubated to observe dye decolourization. After 24 – 72 hours 
incubation, the bacteria from the decolourized test tube were streak plated on enrichment agar medium and 
mineral salt (MS) agar medium having 20 ppm of respective dye. Bacterial colonies that showed a clear 
decolourization zone around them on enrichment agar medium were picked and cultured for 24 hours at 35°C in MS medium amended with 1ml/l TE solution. Then, 1 ml of the culture of individual colo ny was reintroduced 
into 9 ml enrichment medium. To observe decolourization activity by individual bacteria, 1 ml of the culture of 
individual colony was added into 9 ml MS medium separately containing 20 ppm of respective dye, and then 
incubated for 16 hours at 35°C. Then, 2 ml of incubated media was taken out aseptically and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes. The cell free supernatant was used to determine the percentage decolourization of the added dye. Isolate showing the most decolourization of the added dye was selected and preserved for further 
studies.  
2.3 Determination of colour intensity and decolourization activity  
The colour intensity of the sample was determined with standard spectroscopic methods [20] . Decolourization 
activity was expressed in terms of percentage decolourization and was determined by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at absor ption maxima (λ 
max) using UV -Visible spectrophotometer. The uninoculated MS medium 
supplemented with respective dye was used as reference. At different time intervals, the 2 ml samples were collected from reaction mixture and centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min to separate biomass. The concentration of dye in the supernatant was determined by monitoring the absorbance at the maximum absorption wavelength (λ 
max) at 660 nm for Blue H/C dye and 470 nm for Red 3B and Yellow 3R dye. [21] .   
The decolourization assay was calculated according to the following formula –   
Dye Decolourization activity (%) =                                                                                 × 100  
2.4 Identification of dye -degrading bacteria by 16S rDNA gene sequence  
Genomic DNA was extracted from dye decolourizing bacteria using CTAB method [22] . The PCR primers used 
to amplify 16S rDNA fragments were the bacteria- specific primers a forward primer F27 (5' –  
AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG – 3´; Tm: 61°C); and a reverse primer R1391 (5' –  
GACGGGCGGTGTGTRCA – 3´; Tm: 67.4°C). A total of 25 µl of reaction mixture consisted of –  water 15µl, 
MgCl 2 2.5µl, buffer 2. 5, dNTPs 0.5µl, template 1µl, primer (forward 2 µl and reverse 2 µl). The PCR 
amplification was performed by Swift™ Minipro Thermal Cycler (Model: SWT -MIP-0.2-2, Singapore) using 
the following program:  Denaturing at 95°C for 5 minutes, followed by 40 cycl es of 40 seconds of denaturing at 
95°C, 60 seconds of annealing at 65°C and 2 minutes of elongation at 72°C with a final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes. Then, the PCR products were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium

 bromide and visualized on a UV transilluminator for the presence of about 1500 bp PCR products. The 
amplified PCR product was cleaned by using a AccuPrep® Gel Purification Kit (Bioneer corporation, Korea) in 
accordance to the manufacturer’s protocol. PCR amplifi ed 16s rDNA of the screened isolates was sent for 
automated sequencing (Applied Biosystem 3130) to the Centre for Advanced Research in Science (CARS) 
under Dhaka University, Bangladesh. The sequence generated from automated sequencing of PCR amplified DNA was analyzed through NCBI BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) program to find out possible similar 
organism through alignment of homologous sequences. Finally, the isolates were identified based on alignment of partial sequence of 16S rDNA with the existin g sequences available in the database.  
2.5 Determination of optimum growth conditions  
To determine the optimum pH of bacterial growth, culture medium was adjusted to pH 6.5, 7.0, 7.5 and 8.0. For determination of optimum temperatures, inoculated media wer e incubated at 25 
0C, 30 0C, 35 0C and 40 0C. The 
growths of bacteria at different condition were determined at different time intervals by measuring optical density at 660 nm with photoelectric colorimeter.  
2.6 Antibiotic sensitivity test  
Sensitivity of antibiotic to the isolated bacteria was performed  as described by Saha [23] . 
2.7 Influence of different parameters on process of dye decolourization  
The effect of temperature,  pH, initial dye concentration, inoculum size and co -substrate (yeast extract) 
concentration on decolourization of Blue H/C dye, Red 3B dye and Yellow 3R by isolated bacteria, A. faecalis  
E5.Cd  and A. faecalis  Fal.3  was examined after 96 hours of incubation. To examine the effect of pH on dye 
decolourization, 1 ml of cell suspension (5×10
6 cells) was used to inoculate 50 ml test tubes containing 10 ml 
MS medium, supplemented with 100 ppm individual dye. Then, the media were adjusted to pH 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8 
and 8.5, and incubated at 35 0C for 96 hours. For determination of effect of temperature, MS medium 
supplemented with 100 ppm individual dye was adjusted to pH 7. Then, media inoculated with equal density of 
bacterial cells were incubated at 25 0C, 30 0C, 35 0C and 40 0C for 96 hours. To test the effect of different dye 
concentrations on their decolourization, MS media supplemented with 50, 100, 150 and 200 ppm individual dye 
were adjusted to pH 7. Then, the m edia inoculated with bacterial isolates were incubated at 35 0C for 96 hours.             
To determine the effect of inoculum size on decolourization,  MS media supplemented with 100 ppm individual 
dye were adjusted to pH 7. Then, 9.5 or 9 or 8.5 or 8 ml of MS medium for each condition was inoculated 
respectively with 0.5 ml (5 %), 1 ml (10 %), 1.5 ml (15 %) and 2 ml (20 %) of suspension of bacterial isolates. Then, the inoculated media were incubated at 35 
0C for 96 hours.  To investigate the effect of yeast extract on 
decolourization, MS media supplemented with 0 %, 0.1 %, 0.5 % or 1 % of yeast -extract, and 100 ppm 
individual sye were adjusted to pH 7. Then, the media inoculated with bacterial isolates were incubated at 35 0C 
for 96 hours.

 Unless indicated otherwise, all experiments were independently conducted three times and data were pooled for 
presentation as mean±SEM. All data were analyzed with Prism software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA) using 
two-tailed unpaired Student’s t- tests. P-values <0.05 were considered significant.  
3. Results  
3.1 A. faecalis strain E5.Cd and A. faecalis strain Fa1.3 which were isolated from textile effluent were 
efficient azo dye decolourizing bacteria  
The study was started by screening for potential textile dye decolourizing bacteria isolated from effluents of the 
textile industries. Colonies with decolourized zone were isolated and then tested for dye removal capability using 20 ppm Blue H/C, Red 3B an d Yellow 3R dye as the sole carbon source in the MS medium. Five 
morphologically distinct bacterial isolates (labeled as IBR -1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) were identified for decolourization of 
Blue H/C and Red 3B dye. Among them, isolate IBR -5 showed highest decolour ization activity for Blue H/C 
and Red 3B dye (Fig. 1A, B). Four morphologically distinct bacterial isolates (labeled as IY -1, 2, 3 and 4) were 
identified for decolourization of Yellow 3R dye. Among them, isolate IY -3 showed highest decolourization 
activity  for Yellow 3R dye (Fig. 1C).  Both IBR -5 and IY -3 were identified as gram -negative, rod -shaped and 
motile bacteria.  As IBR -5 and IY -3 were most efficient azo dye decolourizing bacteria among the 9 bacterial 
isolates, these two isolates were selected for 16S rDNA based identification and characterization. For 16S rDNA based identification of IBR -5 and IY -3, the 16S rDNA isolated from two bacterial strains was amplified using 
bacteria specific universal primers 27F and 1391R. Then, the isolated 16S rDNA was  used for sequencing. 
These sequences were submitted to NCBI.  The highest  similarity was shown for IBR -5 (99% similarity) to  A. 
faecalis  strain E5.Cd , and for IY -3 (98% similarity) to  A. faecalis  strain Fa1.3.

 3.2 Both strains of A. faecalis grow optimally at 35 0C 
Optimum temperature for growth of both A. faecalis  strain E5.Cd and A. faecalis  strain Fa1.3 was determined at 
pH 7 in nutrient broth medium. The optimum temperature for growth of  both studied strain was found to be 35 
0C (Fig. 2A, B). For A. faecalis  strain E5.Cd, the maximum growth rate (OD 0.7) was observed at 35 0C while 
the minimum growth rate (OD 0.37) was observed at 25 0C (Fig. 2A). Similarly, the maximum growth rate (OD 
1.5) of A. faecalis  strain Fa1.3 was observed at 35 0C while the minimum growth rate (OD 0.75) was observed at 
25 0C (Fig. 2B).

hours incubation at 25 0C, 30 0C, 35 0C and 40 0C by measuring optical density at 660 nm  
3.3 A. faecalis strain E5.Cd and A. faecalis strain Fa1.3 grow optimally at pH 7 and pH 8 respectively  
Optimum pH for growth of Blue H/C and Red 3B dye decolourizing bacteria ( A. faecalis  strain E5.Cd) and 
Yellow 3R dye decolourizing bacteria ( A. faecalis  strain Fa1.3)  was determined at 35 0C temperature in liquid 
broth medium.  
As shown in Fig. 3A, A. faecalis  strain E5.Cd exhibited maximum growth (OD 0.68) at pH 7 and the minimum 
growth (OD 0.61) at pH 8 while A. faecalis  strain Fa1.3 showed the maximum  growth rate (OD 1.5) at pH 8 
(Fig. 3B) .  
3.4 Both strains of A. faecalis were sensitive to all studied antibiotics except Bacitracin   
Study of antibiotic sensitivity pattern is vital to maintain pure culture of a bacterial isolate as well as to take a 
decision for using it safely in any environmental application. In this study, the patterns of antibiotic sensitivity 
of two isolated bacterial strains were tested by disk -diffusion method using nutrient agar medium.  
It was found that both strains were resis tant to Bacitracin while they were sensitive to 8 other antibiotics (data 
not shown). However, both of the isolated strains showed intermediate sensitive to Cephradine (data not shown).    00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.8

Figure 3: Optimum pH for growth of the bacterial strains A. faecalis  E5.Cd (A) and A. faecalis  Fa1.3 (B) at  35

pH 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 8.0 and 8.5 by measuring optical density at 660 nm  
3.5 Dye-decolourization efficacy of both strains of A. faecalis were dependent on incubation temperature, pH, 
initial dye concentration, inoculum size and supplementation of co -substrate  
It was observed that the percentage of dye decolourization activity varied with change in pH of the medium. The 
optimal pH for decolourization of Blue H/C and Red 3B dye by A. faecalis  strain E5.Cd was pH 8 and 7 
respectively  (Fig. 4A, B), and for decolour ization of Yellow 3R dye by A. faecalis  strain Fa1.3 was pH 7 (Fig. 
4C). However, the optimum pH of growth of A. faecalis  strain E5.Cd and A. faecalis  strain Fa1.3 was pH 7 and 
8 respectively (Fig. 3A, B). For all of studied dye viz. Blue H/C, Red 3B and Y ellow 3R dyes, the 
decolourization activity was increased as the temperature increased up to 350C, but the colour removal ability 
was decreased at 400C temperature (Fig. 5A, B, C). Thus, the results revealed that the optimal incubation 
temperature for the decolourization of the studied dyes was 350C (Fig. 5A, B, C).

Effect of dye concentration on dye -decolourization by both strains of A. faecalis  was measured. It was found 
that the percentage of decolourization activity decreased as the dye concentration increased (Fig. 6A, B, C) with 
an exception for 100 ppm Red -3B dye (Fig. 6B). However, the difference between decolourization activities for 
50 ppm and 100 ppm dye concentration were statistically insignificant for all three studied dyes (Fig. 6A, B, C).

Conversely, the percentage of decolourization increased as the inoculum size increased, but these increases of 
decolourization activity were statistically insignificant for all studied dyes (Fig. 7A, B, C). Thus, it indicates that the effect of inoculum size on decolourization of the studied dyes by isolated bacteria was obscure.

4. Discussion  
In this study, two strains of Alcaligenes faecalis  viz. A. faecalis  E5.Cd and A. faecalis  Fa1.3 were identified as 
azo dye decolourizing bacteria.  Similarly, it has been reported that A. faecalis  is an efficient  dye decolourizing 
bacteria for Direct Blue- 15 dye, Acid Orange -7 dye, Melanoidin and Reactive Orange 13  [18, 19, 24, 25] . 
However, some strains of A. faecalis can decolourize textile dyes efficiently when they are in a bacterial 
consortium [24, 25] . Treatments by consortium of anaerobic and aerobic microbes have been suggested to 
enhance the degradation of azo dyes [26] . Though, the pure culture of some strains of A. faecalis  has been 
shown to be efficient decolourizer of textile dyes  in many studies as we found in this study. Besides, use of 
microbial enzymes for dye decolourization has been reported in recent years for its effective application in 
treatment of textile dyes [27] . However, reactive azo dyes usually  have a synthetic origin and intricate aromatic 
molecular structures, which make them steady and hard to biodegrade and generally considered as xenobiotic 
[28]. Both A. faecalis  E5.Cd and A. faecalis  Fa1.3 showed better growth and  decolorization efficacy in the 
temperature range from 30 °C to 35 °C which was supported by similar results found in another study [29] . In 
this study, optimum pH for growth and decolorization efficacy of both strains was observed between pH 7 and 8. Similarly, it was reported that A. faecalis  can grow optimally at pH 7 [30]. We found that the color removal 
percentage of most dyes increased sharply with the addition of yeast extract which is also supported by other studies [31]. Metabolism of yeast extract is considered vital for the restoration of NADH, which is the electron 
donor for the azo bond reduction [32].  However, we found that decolourization activity was not significantly 
dependent on inoculum s ize which may be due to measuring the decolourization activity after long incubation 
period (96 hours). In this study, isolated bacterial strains showed maximum decolourization activity at lower dye concentration. Decrease in decolourization ability at hig h dye concentration might be due to the toxicity of the 
dye [31]. In addition, azo dyes generally contain one or more sulphonic -acid groups o n aromatic rings, which 
might act as detergents to inhibit the growth of microorganisms [31] . Although the decolourization efficacy of  
A. fae calis  E5.Cd  and A. faecalis  Fal.3 was prompting  there were few limitations of this study. Decolourization 
efficacy of the isolated bacteria was studied only for three types of azo dyes but their efficacy to decolourize 
many  other types of  azo dyes remained  obscured . Likewise , decolourization efficacy  of the isolated bacteria  was 
tasted in small -scale  in lab  which do not ensure their similar decolourization capacity in large -scale in industrial 
bioreactor. Notably, the higher rate of decolourization of azo d yes by the isolated bacteria does  not confirm  the 
higher detoxification rate  of azo dyes. Hence, it should be recommended that toxicity of the decolourized azo 
dyes have to be tested before considering the A. faecalis  E5.Cd  and A. faecalis  Fal.3 as efficient  microbial 
agent s for using in  an industrial  bioreactor to neutralize the textile effluents.    
5. Conclusion  
Altogether, the results of this study indicate that the isolated and the identified strains  A. faecalis  E5.Cd  and A. 
faecalis  Fal.3  were bacitracin -resistant efficient azo dye decolourizing bacteria which can be used to develop an 
effective microorganism -facilitated treatment method following the observed optimal conditions ( pH between 7 American Scientific  Research Journal for Engineering, Technology, and Sciences (ASRJETS ) (2017 ) Volume 31, No  1, pp 163 -175

 and 8, temperature 350C, 50 ppm initial dye con centration, and 1% co -substrate supplementation) for their 
highest efficacy of decolourization of azo dye.
