Decolourisation of the azo dye model compound, Congo Red (CR), and real textile wastewater, was
assessed in one- and two-stage anaerobic treatment systems (R 1and R 2, respectively). High colour rem-
ovals were achieved in both treatment systems even when a very high CR concentration (1.2 mM) was
applied. However, R 2presented a slightly better stability, in which the acidogenic reactor (R 2,A) played
a major role on dye reduction, as compared to the methanogenic reactor (R 2,M), evidencing the role of
fermentative microorganisms. The minimum electron donor concentration required to sustain dye reduc-
tion was much higher than the stoichiometric amount. Additionally, a decrease on the hydraulic reten-tion time (from 24 to 12 h) did not signiﬁcantly affect decolourisation, indicating that electron transfer
was not a concern. Finally, experiments with real textile wastewater showed low decolourisation efﬁ-
ciencies in both systems, most likely due to the presence of dyes not susceptible to reductive decolouri-sation under these experimental conditions.

1. Introduction
The textile industry represents an important economic sector
worldwide, being responsible for 1.7% of world exportation in
2007, which corresponded to the amount of US$ 238.1 billions
(WTO, 2008 ). Thus, with the increased demand for textile prod-
ucts in last decades, a proportional wastewater generation in-
crease was observed, through which large amounts of dyes and
other chemicals are released into superﬁcial waters ( dos Santos
et al., 2007 ).
In particular, coloured efﬂuents release into the environment is
undesirable not only for affecting the aesthetics, the water trans-
parency and the gas solubility in water bodies, but also because
many dyes and their breakdown products are toxic, mutagenic or
carcinogenic ( Banat et al., 1996; Weisburger, 2002 ).
Colour removal of these compounds is still one of the most dif-
ﬁcult tasks faced by wastewaters treatment plants (WTP) of textile
factories, mainly because dyes and pigments are designed to resist
biodegradation, allowing them to remain in the environment for an
extended period of time. For instance, the half-life of the hydroly-
sed dye Reactive Blue 19 is about 46 years at pH 7 and 25 /C176C(Hao
et al., 2000 ).
Amongst the different decolourisation methods, the biological
treatment has called attention for being economically attractive.However, colour removal by aerobic bacteria, such as those
commonly present in activated sludge systems, is normally low
(dos Santos et al., 2007 ), which is mainly associated with the dye
adsorption in the sludge ( Alinsaﬁ et al., 2006 ). On the other hand,
under anaerobic conditions, effective dye decolourisation can be
reached ( Van der Zee et al., 2001 ).
This process is also referred as dye reduction, being the azo dye
reduction biochemistry mostly reported in literature. The azo bond
(–N@N–) cleavage involves four electrons (reducing equivalents)
transfer to the azo dye, which acts as a ﬁnal electron acceptor. After
this cleavage aromatic amines are produced ( dos Santos et al.,
2007 ).
Because dye reduction competes with methanogenesis for the
same electrons generated upon electron donor oxidation ( dos
Santos et al., 2006 ), it seems that a two-stage anaerobic system,
in which acidogenic and methanogenic phases are separated,
could be an interesting option to enhance colour removal, since
the probability of the electrons to be channeled to dye reduction
would be higher. However, two-stage anaerobic treatment sys-
tems have scarcely been applied for textile wastewater
decolourisation.
The main goal of the present investigation was to assess the
decolourisation of the azo dye Congo Red (CR) and real textile
wastewater in one- and two-stage anaerobic systems under differ-ent operational conditions, such as different CR and electron donor
(ethanol) concentrations, and different hydraulic retention times
(HRT).

2. Methods
2.1. Reactors
The UASB reactors were made of PVC tubes and connections for
sewage. The one-stage system (R 1)(Fig. 1 ) consisted of only one
reactor while the two-stage system (R 2)(Fig. 2 ) consisted of an aci-
dogenic reactor (R 2,A), a settler and a methanogenic reactor (R 2,M).
The more relevant reactors dimensions are shown in Table 1 .
With the exception of R 2,A, the other reactors had a modiﬁed
gas–solid-liquid separator (Y-shaped). In order to avoid the forma-tion of preferential ﬂow paths or short circuiting ﬂows trough the
sludge blanket and facilitate the biogas release, avoiding the piston
effect (sludge blanket rise due to entrapped biogas), a slow stirrer
(5 rpm) was installed in the reactors.
The inﬂuent was stored at 4 /C176C and the reactors were operated
at room temperature of approximately 27 /C176C. The biogas produced
was collected and washed in a NaOH solution (0.5 N), after whichmethane was measured in a Mariotte ﬂask (liquid displacement
method).
2.2. Seed inoculum
The anaerobic sludge used in this experiment was collected
from a brewery mesophilic UASB reactor (Insustrial District, Ceará,
Brazil). The sludge volume added in the reactors provided a sludge
concentration of approximately 30 g VSS/L.
2.3. Synthetic textile wastewater
The synthetic wastewater was composed of distilled water, dye,
carbon source (electron donor), basal medium (nutrients) and a buf-
fer. The dye used was Congo Red (CR) (or Direct Red 28, DR28) (ana-
lytical grade, Vetec, Brazil), a direct diazo benzidine-containing dye.
Ethanol was selected as the electron donor (99.8% purity, Dinâmica,
Brazil). The basal medium consisted of (mg/L): NH
4Cl (280), K 2HPO 4
(250), MgSO 4/C17H2O (100) and CaCl 2/C12H2O (10) and 1 mL/L of trace
elements containing (mg/L): H 3BO3(50), FeCl 2/C14H2O (2000), ZnCl 2
(50), MnCl 2/C14H2O (500), CuCl 2/C12H2O (38), (NH 4)6Mo 7O24/C14H2O
(50), AlCl 3/C16H2O (90), CoCl 2/C16H2O (2000), NiCl 2/C16H2O (92), Na 2-
SeO 3/C15H2O (162), EDTA (1000) and HCl 36% (1). To keep the pH
around 7.0, the wastewater was buffered with sodium bicarbonate
(NaHCO 3) in the proportion of 1 g NaHCO 3to each 1 g COD ethanol.
2.4. Real textile wastewater
Textile wastewater was collected once a week from a cotton-
processing factory (Industrial District, Ceará, Brazil). It is worth
mentioning that the dyeing process of this factory is continuous
and utilizes many different reactive dyes. Because the pH value
was usually alkaline ( /C2410) the pH was adjusted to 7.0 with sulphu-
ric acid (H 2SO4), after which electron donor (1.0 g COD/L), nutrients
and buffer were added.
2.5. Experimental procedure
The experiment with synthetic textile wastewater was divided
in seven periods ( Table 2 ), including reactors start-up (acclimatiza-
tion period) (period I).NaOHBiogas Methane

period, CR was introduced at a low concentration of 0.3 mM
(/C24210 mg/L) (period II) in order to avoid a possible microbial inhi-
bition. After verifying reactors stability, CR concentration was in-
creased to 0.6 and 1.2 mM, during the periods III and IV,
respectively. In periods V and VI, ethanol concentration was re-
duced to 0.2 and 0.5 g COD/L, respectively, to assess the electron
donor concentration effect on dye decolourisation. The HRT de-
crease effect on colour removal was assessed in period VII.
After the latter period was ﬁnished, the HRT was re-established
and a new acclimatization period took place in a CR-free medium.
After this period, the reactors were fed with the real textilewastewater.
2.6. Analyses
Colour was usually analysed three times a week and deter-
mined photometrically (Thermo-Nicolet Evolution 100). For thesynthetic wastewater, the absorbance was read at wavelength ( k)
of 496 nm, i.e. at wavelength whose absorbance is maximum. Sam-
ples were previously diluted (1:5) in a phosphate buffer (10.86 g/L
NaH
2PO4/C12H2O and 5.98 g/L Na 2HPO 4/C12H2O) and, then, centrifuged
for 2 min at 13,000 rpm (Eppendorf – Mini Spin).
For the real wastewater, after sample centrifugation, absor-
bance was also read at wavelength of maximum absorbance. How-
ever, since the wastewater composition was variable, the kvalue
was not ﬁxed. Hence, a UV–vis scanning was made for each sample
to determine the kof maximum absorbance, which usually ranged
between 510 and 580 nm.
COD, pH, alkalinity and volatile fatty acids (VFA) were usually
analysed twice a week. COD was determined photometrically
(Thermo-Nicolet Evolution 100) by the closed reﬂux method, while
pH was determined by potentiometric method (Digimed – DM 20)and alkalinity by titrimetric method, all of them according to Stan-
dard Methods ( APHA, 2005 ). VFA were determined using Kapp
titrimetric method ( Buchauer, 1998 ).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthetic textile wastewater3.1.1. Colour removal
3.1.1.1. Effect of dye concentration. After the acclimatization period
(period I), the dye model compound CR was introduced at a con-
centration of 0.3 mM ( /C24210 mg/L) (period II) in both systems.
The results revealed that their performance, during this period,
was very stable ( Fig. 3 ) and no remarkable difference was found
between the two treatment systems. Colour removal efﬁciencies
were very high for both systems ( Table 3 ), with values from 95%
up to 99%.
These colour removal efﬁciencies are better than those reported
byRajaguru et al. (2000) , who found 95% CR (200 mg/L) decolouri-
sation using an anaerobic ﬁlter operated with a HRT of 36 h and
5 g/L of glucose as electron donor (5.35 g COD/L). Therefore, it is
veriﬁed that, even with the higher HRT and electron donor concen-
tration in the latter work, the colour removal efﬁciencies reached
by R
1and R 2in the present study were higher, probably becauseTable 1

tors compared to ﬁxed-ﬁlm systems ( Van der Zee and Villaverde,
2005 ).
Despite showing minor instability ( Fig. 3 ), the acidogenic reac-
tor (R 2,A) achieved colour removal efﬁciencies higher than 90% ( Ta-
ble 3 ), even when operated with a HRT of only 4 h. Therefore, the
acidogenic reactor was the main responsible for the total decolo-
urisation obtained by the two-stage system. The hypothesis of uti-
lizing a two-stage reactor is based on the fact that methanogenesis
competes with CR for the same electrons generated upon substrate
oxidation. Thus, by separating the two processes, the probability of
the electrons to be channelled to the dye would be higher, which
would enhance colour removal. However, in the present experi-
ment, CR was easily reduced, which probably masked the effect
of separation of acidogenic and methanogenic phases.
Talarposhti et al. (2001) used a two-stage system in the treat-
ment of a synthetic wastewater composed by a mixture of seven
basic dyes (1000 mg/L) with whey powder as the electron donor.
The system consisted of a stirred acidogenic tank (HRT = 24 h) fol-
lowed by an anaerobic ﬁlter (HRT = 48 h). They also veriﬁed the
important contribution of acidogenesis to the colour removal pro-
cess, which was responsible for approximately 54% of the total col-our removal efﬁciency (74%) of the two-stage system. Therefore,
the ﬁndings of the present investigation are in accordance with
the above mentioned work.
In period III, CR concentration was increased to 0.6 mM
(/C24420 mg/L) but the system performance was similar to that ob-
served in the previous period, even though R
2,Awas less stable
and its average colour removal efﬁciency dropped from 93.2 to
86.7%.
When the CR concentration was increased to 1.2 mM
(/C24840 mg/L) (period IV), R 1showed instability and the decolouri-
sation efﬁciency dropped from 98.1 (period III) to 95.1%, while R 2
kept the same performance observed in the previous periods.R
2,A; however, it presented a decrease of nearly 10% in its colour re-
moval efﬁciency and showed a slightly higher instability than in
period III, likely because of the low HRT in the acidogenic phase.
Some studies with UASB reactors also indicated colour removal
decrease after the dye concentration was increased ( Brás et al.,
2005; Sponza and Is /C223ik, 2005 ).Sponza and Is /C223ik (2005) , for instance,found a decolourisation decrease from 100 to 80% when the con-
centration of the dye Direct Black 38 was increased from 100 to
3200 mg/L, in a system operated at a HRT between 15 and 16.5 h
with glucose as the electron donor (3 g COD/L). Brás et al. (2005)
also found a colour removal decrease from 92% to 85% when the
Acid Orange 7 concentration increased from 60 mg/L to 300 mg/L
in a UASB reactor operated at a HRT of 24 h and supplemented with
1.8 g COD/L of acetate.
Concerning R 2,Aperformance in these two last periods, it is
worth mentioning that, in spite of a sudden initial drop on colour
removal efﬁciency after the dye concentration was increased, a fast
recovery was found, which indicates that this inoculum adapted to
the new operational conditions.
3.1.1.2. Effect of electrons donor concentration. Theoretically, two
pairs of electrons are required to reduce an azo bond (–N @N–),
i.e. 32 mg COD per mmol of monoazo dye ( Van der Zee and Villav-
erde, 2005 ). Thus, to reduce 1.2 mM of CR (diazo), it is necessary
76.8 mg COD/L, which represents less than 10% of the supple-
mented COD as electron donor (1 g/L), during the ﬁrst four periods
of this experiment.
Ethanol concentration was reduced to 0.2 g COD/L (period V),
which was still higher than the stoichiometric concentration re-
quired for CR reduction. Data shown in Fig. 3 indicates a continu-
ous colour removal decrease in the reactors, especially in R 2,A,
during the ﬁrst seven days, and a subsequent gradual increase,
reaching values close or slightly higher than those obtained at
the end of the previous period.
Initially, these results suggest that the efﬁciency drop can be
due to the smaller concentration of available substrate, which af-
fected dye reduction kinetics ( Van der Zee and Villaverde, 2005 ).
However, it is also possible that an electron donor competition be-
tween dye-reducing and non-dye-reducing microorganisms has
occurred, and, therefore, fewer electrons were channelled to re-
duce the dye ( dos Santos et al., 2006 ).
Later, in period VI, ethanol concentration was increased to 0.5 g
COD/L, which positively affected the reactors performance in terms
of colour removal efﬁciency ( Table 3 ) and stability, noticeably R 2,A
(Fig. 3 ). R1performance in this periodwas closeto that obtainedin R 2.Table 3

The standard deviation is shown in parenthesis.7776 P.I.M. Firmino et al. / Bioresource Technology 101 (2010) 7773–7779In the present investigation, a direct effect between the elec-
trons donor concentration and the decolourisation efﬁciency was
observed, since the anaerobic consortium tested was incapable of
using CR as a carbon and energy source, therefore an electron do-
nor dosage was needed. However, literature reports contradictory
results on the effect of substrate concentration. For instance, Ong
et al. (2005b) used an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (SBR)
(reaction time = 21.5 h) and found an increase from 30 to 80% on
Acid Orange 7 (50 mg/L) decolourisation by doubling the concen-
tration of a mixture of bacto-peptone and sucrose (1:3). Is/C223ik and
Sponza (2005a) used a UASB reactor (HRT = 18–19 h) and did not
observe any change in the CR (100 mg/L) decolourisation when
glucose concentration increased from 100 to 500 mg COD/L. How-
ever, it is important mentioning that studies with low concentra-
tions of easily reduced dyes associated to a high substrateconcentration do not tend to reveal major differences on colour
removal.
3.1.1.3. Effect of HRT. By decreasing the HRT of both reactors by half
(period VII), with the exception of R
2,A, both systems were more
unstable than in the previous period, i.e. a higher standard devia-
tion, even though the efﬁciency averages were very close ( Table
3). Once again reactor R 2was more efﬁcient than R 1, and the acido-
genic stage (R 2,A) was responsible for about 83% of the total decolo-
urisation of the two-stage system, even when it was operated with
a HRT of only 2 h.
The results revealed that CR was not a very recalcitrant dye,
since a colour removal higher than 95% could be found with a short
HRT (about 8 h) ( Costa et al., 2010 ).dos Santos et al. (2005b) eval-
uated the decolourisation of Reactive Red 2 (1250 mg/L) in a EGSB
reactor, and found that the HRT decrease from 10 to 5 and, then, to
2.5 h, decreased the colour removal efﬁciencies from 56 to 37 andto 13%, respectively, therefore suggesting that the HRTs used were
not long enough to allow dye reduction satisfactorily.
Since the effect of HRT on decolourisation may be inﬂuenced by
the dye structure and the type of reactor, different results are re-
ported in literature ( Sandhya et al., 2005; Sponza and Is /C223ik, 2002;
Talarposhti et al., 2001 ). For instance, Sponza and Is /C223ik (2002) stud-
ied the azo dye Reactive Black 5 (100 mg/L) decolourisation in a
UASB reactor using 3 g COD/L of glucose as electron donor, and
found a decrease from 97 to 87% when the HRT was reduced from
30 to 3 h. In contrast, Sandhya et al. (2005) observed a reduction of
only 1% (from 84 to 83%) when the HRT of an anaerobic ﬁlter de-
creased from 10 to only 3.6 h, while treating the azo dye Golden
Yellow (50 mg/L) with glucose (100 mg/L) and yeast extract
(200 mg/L) as electron donors.
3.1.2. COD removal and operational stability
Operational data for reactors performance are shown in Table 3 ,
in which a good operational stability can be observed for both sys-
tems. The average pH values achieved are in accordance with
Pearce et al. (2003) , who afﬁrmed the optimum pH for colour re-
moval is, in general, neutral or slightly alkaline.
COD removal efﬁciency of R
1decreased with CR concentration
increase (periods II, III and IV), which could indicate microbial inhi-
bition by dye toxicity. However, a gradual increase can also be ob-
served in inﬂuent and efﬂuent COD values, which corresponded to
the additional amount of dye in each period.
According to Is/C223ik and Sponza (2005a) , 100 mg/L of CR are equiv-
alent to a COD of 74.6 mg/L. Therefore, 210 and 420 mg/L (0.3 and
0.6 mM) of CR are equivalent to, respectively, 156.7 and 313.3 mg
COD/L, which corresponds approximately to the arithmetic differ-
ence between the average values of the efﬂuent COD in periods II
and III (153.9 mg/L) and between the values in periods III and IV
(269.4 mg/L) of R 1. Thus, the difference between the initial andﬁnal COD value kept practically constant. The same behaviour
can be observed in R 2.
Brás et al. (2005) also found COD efﬁciency decreased from 92
to 67% when the Acid Orange 7 concentration increased from
60 mg/L to 300 mg/L in a UASB reactor. However, the electron do-
nor conversion was not affected since no acetate accumulation was
found. Hence, the authors concluded that the residual COD could
be attributed to non-reduced dye or its metabolites (aromatic
amines).
During periods IV, V and VI, when ethanol concentration varied,
a considerable drop in the COD removal efﬁciency was found. It is
clearly noticed that the efﬂuent concentration was practically
unaltered, i.e. the recalcitrant fraction, in which CR is included, re-
mained the same because there was no change in its composition.
Thus, the average efﬁciency simply changed because the amount ofinﬂuent biodegradable organic matter (ethanol) varied. These re-
sults are in agreement with the ones found in Is/C223ik and Sponza
(2005a) , who used a UASB reactor treating a CR-containing syn-
thetic wastewater (100 mg/L) and observed a COD removal efﬁ-
ciency decrease from 78 to 68% by decreasing the glucose
concentration (electrons donor) from 500 to 100 mg/L. On the
other hand, Kapdan and Oztekin (2006) studied an anaerobic SBR
to remove the dye Remazol Red RR (60 mg/L) and found a COD re-
moval efﬁciency decrease from about 70 to 45% when the initial
COD (glucose) was between 400 and 800 mg/L, and above
1300 mg/L, respectively.
Later, when the reactors HRT was reduced by half (period VII), a
total COD removal efﬁciency increase was observed in relation to
the previous period, although the inﬂuent composition was the
same. The ﬁnal COD was also smaller than the one achieved in pre-
vious periods. From these results, it can be suggested that decreas-
ing HRT the contact time between sludge and aromatic amines
formed upon CR reduction would be shorter. So, the toxic effect
of the breakdown products might have decreased, which increased
COD removal.
Several studies report a positive relation between HRT and COD
removal ( Brás et al., 2005; dos Santos et al., 2005 b;Is/C223ik and Sponza,
2005b, 2008; Kapdan and Oztekin, 2006; Ong et al., 2005a; Sand-
hya et al., 2005 ). For example, Is/C223ik and Sponza (2005b) observed
a COD removal reduction while treating a synthetic textile waste-
water containing a mixture of ﬁve azo dyes (250 mg/L, 50 mg/L
each) in a UASB reactor. The average efﬁciency dropped from
79.9 to 29.4% when the HRT was decreased from 100 to 6 h. How-
ever, Sponza and Is /C223ik (2002) found contradictory results when the
HRT of a UASB reactor treating the azo dye Reactive Black 5
(100 mg/L) was decreased from 30 (40.8%) to 15.7 h (56%) and,
then, to 3 h (26.6%). Çinar et al. (2008) , although using a different
treatment system (an anaerobic–aerobic SBR) to decolourise100 mg/L of the azo dye Reactive Violet 5, also observed a similar
behaviour. When the anaerobic phase of the reactor decreased
from 24 to 12 h, the average COD removal changed from 87 to
78%, but it increased to 84% when the anaerobic reaction time
was decreased to 6 h.
Finally, it is worth mentioning that the residual COD, in all
experimental periods, was still very high. Additionally, dye decolo-
urisation by-products are normally toxic, carcinogenic or, even,
mutagenic. Therefore, a post-treatment for the anaerobic efﬂuents
is required.
3.2. Real textile wastewater3.2.1. Colour removal
Colour removal efﬁciencies and absorbance values for inﬂuent
and efﬂuent are shown in Table 4 . It can be noted that the decolo-
urisation efﬁciency presented considerable variation, which can
not be completely attributed to the reactors instability becauseP.I.M. Firmino et al. / Bioresource Technology 101 (2010) 7773–7779 7777the wastewater was collected weekly and varied with the factory
production process; its composition changed and inﬂuenced inﬂu-
ent absorbance values. However, the efﬂuent absorbance was usu-
ally close to 0.2. Therefore, the lower inﬂuent absorbance, the
lower the registered colour removal efﬁciency. Although colour re-
moval efﬁciencies were smaller than the ones found with synthetic
wastewater, the systems were efﬁcient with both wastewaters.
Somasiri et al. (2008) used a UASB reactor (HRT = 24 h) supple-
mented with nutrients and glucose to treat a real textile wastewa-
ter (COD total= 6 g/L) and found 95% colour removal, even when the
initial absorbance at wavelength of maximum absorbance
(k= 580 nm) was only 0.35.On the other hand, S/C223en and Demirer
(2003) used a ﬂuidized bed reactor (FBR) operated at a HRT of
24 h to treat a real textile wastewater supplemented with glucose(500 mg/L) and nutrients and achieved colour removal efﬁciencies
between 40 and 44%.
It is important to comment that, for some textile wastewaters,
absorbance measurement is difﬁcult due to the absence of expres-
sive peaks in their visible spectrum. The low colour removal efﬁ-
ciencies found in the present investigation can be a result of this
behaviour. Additionally, the probable presence of a considerable
amount of anthraquinonic dyes in the utilized wastewater might
have also been responsible for the low decolourisation reached,
as these dyes are more recalcitrant under reductive conditions
than azo compounds ( Carliell et al., 1994; dos Santos et al., 2005 a).
Concerning the systems performance, colour removal was
slightly higher in the reactor R
1(7% difference), which could be
attributed to the low HRT of 4 h in this phase for the acidogenic
reactor (R 2,A). In other words, the short HRT was not enough to re-
duce the dyes to a tolerable concentration for the methanogenic
reactor (R 2,M), compromising its performance and, consequently,
the overall two-stage system performance. Nevertheless, R 2,Awas
responsible for about 90% of colour removal efﬁciency of the
two-stage system. Hence, no concrete evidence was found which
may indicate the real reason why R 2achieved a lower performance
than R 1.
Chinwekitvanich et al. (2000) obtained an average decolourisa-
tion efﬁciency of only 14% in the ﬁrst stage, which corresponded to
25% of the system total decolourisation (57%), while using an acid-
iﬁcation tank (HRT = 12 h) followed by a UASB reactor (HRT = 12 h)
to treat a diluted reactive red dyeing wastewater ( /C241:6.5), supple-
mented with 500 mg/L of tapioca and nutrients. However, the acid-
iﬁcation tank used in their experiment was not previously
inoculated with any kind of microorganism, which probably justi-
ﬁes the low colour removal achieved in this unit.
The results of the present investigation suggest that the acido-
genic microorganisms are the principal responsible for the colour
removal under anaerobic conditions, which are in agreement of
the ﬁndings of dos Santos et al. (2006) .
3.2.2. COD removal and operational stability
The pH varied between 7.0 and 8.0, and the reactors also
showed a good operational stability, since their total alkalinity
and VFA values were around 900 and 200 mg/L, respectively.
Concerning COD removal ( Table 5 ), the efﬁciencies were nearly
60% and ﬁnal efﬂuent COD was similar to the concentration ob-
tained in periods II and III with synthetic wastewater, when CRconcentrations were lower. This suggests that the dye concentra-
tion in the real textile wastewater, in other words, its recalcitrant
COD, were far lower than the CR concentrations tested (periods
IV–VII).
Somasiri et al. (2008) used a UASB reactor (HRT = 24 h) supple-
mented with nutrients and glucose to treat a real textile wastewa-
ter (COD total= 6 g/L) and obtained a COD removal above 97%, and
efﬂuent COD of 200 mg/L, which was lower than the ones from
the present investigation ( /C24500 mg/L).
In contrast, S/C223en and Demirer (2003) tested a FBR (HRT = 24 h) to
decolourise a real textile wastewater supplemented with glucose
(500 mg/L) and nutrients and found COD removal efﬁciencies be-
tween 62 and 66%, which are close to the ﬁndings of the present
work.
4. Conclusions
Excellent colour removals were achieved even for the very high
dye concentration tested.
R2presented a slightly better stability, in which R 2,Awas the
main responsible for decolourisation, evidencing the role of fer-
mentative microorganisms on dye reduction.
The minimum electron donor concentration required to sustain
dye reduction was much higher than the stoichiometric amount.
HRT reduction did not affect dye decolourisation. Thus, electron
transfer was not a concern in the present investigation.
The experiment with real textile wastewater showed lower
decolourisation efﬁciencies, most likely due to the probable pres-
ence of a considerable amount of anthraquinonic dyes.
