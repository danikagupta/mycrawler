1 Background  
 
In 2006 the Norwegian government granted permission for building of a combined heat and 
power plant (CHP) at the Mongstad Refinery site north of Bergen on the  west coast of Norway. 
The permit for CO 2-emissions from the plant was granted by the Ministry of Environment. An 
agreement on CO 2 handling was signed by the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy and Statoil 
ASA.  
 
This Implementation Agreement states that CO 2 shall be captured from CHP flue gas in a large 
scale capture plant. Annual estimated amounts of 1.3 million tonnes of CO 2 is the basis for 
designing capture plant to condition and compress CO 2 before pipeline transport to geological 
storage under the Norw egian Continental Shelf.  
 
The CO 2 Capture Mongstad (CCM) Project is in an early development phase of project 
development. The project is currently organized as a joint effort by Gassnova SF and Statoil, and 
is funded by the Norwegian government. The purpos e of the project is to plan and build a large 
scale CO 2 capture plant (the CCP).  
 
CCM  invited qualified tenderers for the following activities:  
Establish Sampling of Analytical Procedures for Potentially Harmful Components from Post 
Combustion Amine Based  CO 2 Capture (TQPAmine1)  
Modelling of Atmospheric Dispersion of Components from Post Combustion Amine Based CO 2 
Capture (TQPAmine2)  
Protocol for Evaluation of Solvents – Emission Compound  Toxicity (TQPAmine3)  
Protocol for Evaluation of Solvents – Process a nd Atmospheric Chemistry (TQPAmine4)  
Nitramine Analyses and Screening Toxicity Study (TQPAmine5)  
(Emission Reducing Technologies (TQPAmine6))  
Alternative Approaches to Animal Toxicity Testing (TQPAmine9)  
 
After the Tender Invitation SINTEF was awarded to prepare a protocol for emission toxicity 
evaluation of solvents (TQPAmine3). This project has been conducted in the period June to 
November 2010.  The results of the services may be used for, but not limited  to, the qualification 
of capture plant vendors and their solvents.

2 Introduction  
2.1 Post combustion CO 2 technology and emissions  
The emissions routes from a post combustion CO 2 adsorption process is illustrated in Figure 2.1 . 
The process consists of three main parts:  
 
1. The flue gas pre -treatment . The cooler reduces the flue gas inlet temperature to 40 -50 ºC 
and is important in terms of designing the plant for a neutral water balance.  
2. The CO 2 removal step . This is performed by an absorber column where CO 2 is absorbed 
by the solvent. A water wash section is included on top in order to reduce loss and 
emission of solvent due to evaporation.  
3. The solvent regeneration step . This consists of a desorption (stripper) column, where CO 2 
is stripped off from the solv ent and recovered at high purity in the top, downstream from 
the condenser. The stripping is performed by re -boiling the solvent, so that stripping 
steam is generated in the stripper bottom and rising upwards through the column. The 
solvent leaving the str ipper is re -circulated to the absorber and thereby closing the solvent 
circulation loop.  
 
 
 
 
Figure 2.1  Absorption process for post combustion CO 2 capture.  
 
The main sources of emissions from the process can be summarised as followed:  
 
1. Emissions to air  
o Trace amounts of solvent vapour not captured in the water wash unit  
  
8 
 
   
o Continuous emission of solvent components with the treated flue gas has not 
received significant focus earlier since in conventional applications of absorber 
technology, the treated gas is  not directly emitted but utilized in subsequent 
processing  
2. Reclaimer waste  
o Bottoms product from the solvent reclaimer, aimed at regenerating degraded 
solvent  
o Semi continuous emission, depending on reclaimer technology and operation  
3. Excess desorber conde nsate (semi -continuous, in order to regulate the water balance of 
the process) - sent to water treatment plant  
4. Excess condensate water from gas precooler if the flue gas is cooled below its saturation 
point  
5. Spent filter cartridges (batch wise) for disposal  
6. Solvent leakages and accidental spills – may lead to local pollution of soil  
 
The emissions to air (1) are considered very important since the chemical composition of treated 
flue gas from absorption plants has not been thoroughly investigated and since t he emissions can 
be dispersed over long distances. The flue gas volumes from gas or coal fired power plants are 
very large compared to other process streams treated with absorption technology. A 400 MW 
natural gas fired power plant produces a flue gas flow  of 2 mill. Nm3/hr.  It is therefore clear that 
even trace amounts of pollutants in the gas leaving the absorber will add up to relatively large 
amounts emitted per year. These emissions can potentially lead to environmental risks.  
 
For reclaimer waste (2 ) and excess water (3 -4), which are in the form of liquid/liquid sludge, 
there are treatment options. Reclaimer waste can be incinerated, excess water and condensate can 
be cleaned in a biological waste water treatment plant as conventional spent process w ater. 
However, the scale and extent of new post combustion plants will lead to significantly higher 
volumes of waste materials and emissions than treated earlier.  
 
Solvent leakages and accidental spills (6) may appear on a smaller scale and should be reme died 
by good operation procedures, plant design and maintenance.  
 
Emissions to air and reclaimer waste are considered the most important emission sources . 
2.2 Emissions to air  of amine solvents  
Due to high vapour pressure of the aqueous amines treated flue ga s will contain traces of volatile 
solvent components and water vapour when leaving the absorber sections. The most important 
volatile component is the amine itself, and it has traditionally been considered important to work 
with amines with as low as possi ble vapour pressure. The water wash at the adsorber top is used 
to readsorb evaporated amines and transfer these back to the main solvent cycle. However, amine 
degradation in the combustion process may result in some volatile products, like ammonia 
(NH 3), which will escape together with the purified gas.  
 
The emissions may include entrained droplets, as well as evaporated substances including –    
9 
 
   
   
1. Amines  
2. Ammonia  
3. Aldehydes  
4. Amides  
5. Alkylamines  
6. Nitrosamines  
7. Nitramines  
2.3 Water wash  
Water wash is used to remove water -soluble flue gas compounds from the emissions. The water 
wash is placed on top of the absorber section. The primary objective of the water wash is to 
reabsorb evaporated solvent and transfer it back to the main solvent cy cle and thus minimize the 
amine losses. Treated flue gas exiting from the wash section will be transferred into an exit pipe 
placed on top of the absorber and wash section structure. However, volatile compounds like 
ammonia will mainly escape the water was h system.  
 
2.4 Reclaimer waste   
Solvent degradation implies that the active component of the circulating solvent, the amine, is 
degraded to other species, so that it is no longer active in the reversible reaction with CO 2. There 
are basically three important  degradation mechanisms:  
 
1. Presence of other acidic components than CO 2 in the flue gas  
a. SO 2 and the NO 2-part of NO x will act as stronger acids than CO 2 and bind the 
amines as sulphate and nitrate salts, so called heat stable salts (HSS)  
2. Oxidative degradatio n of the amine  
a. Due to the presence of oxygen in the flue gas, amines will to some extent be 
oxidized. The chemistry is complex, but the primary degradation products are 
ammonia (NH 3) and organic acids (formic and acetic acid and others). The acids 
will bin d to amine cations as additional HSS.  
3. CO 2 induced degradation/carbamate polymerization leading the formation of other amine 
components, e.g. diamines that are stronger bases than the original amine. Also other 
complex organic molecules can be formed.

3 Objectives and scope  
3.1 Description of scope in the Invitation to Tenderer (ITT)  
The objectives and scope of this project was stated in the Invitation to Tender er (ITT)  as follows:  
 
The major objectives of the project are described in the Tender Invitation o f TQPAmine3, 
aiming at “ proposing a protocol for toxicity testing of samples of air emissions and water wash 
that could be used as a toolbox for evaluations of health and environmental risk of emissions 
from post combustion amine based CO 2 capture ”  
 
The s cope was separated in two Call Offs:  
 
1) Call Off 1:  
a. Propose methods on how to sample and handle representative extracts of 
emissions to air from post combustion amine based CO 2 capture to enable toxicity 
testing of the extracts . The sampling methods should enable sampling of 
representative emission extracts, including gaseous, liquid phases and 
particulates/aerosols, and emissions may include entrained droplets and 
evaporated  substances of compound groups described in the ITT ;   
b. Propose method(s) (laboratory experiments) to establish relevant human and 
ecotoxicity data for one or more end -points, as described in the ITT. The 
proposed methods should be established for both air emission and water wash 
samples . The proposed methods should be suited for small emission extracts 
samples  and preferably be in vitro tests.   
This service should include doing an assessment of the suitability of using the proposed 
methods in a) and b) alone, or together with an individual substance risk appr oach, for 
assessing risk of an emission profile and comparison/ranking of emission profiles from 
different solvent/supplier specific technologies for post combustion amine based CO 2 
capture.  
  
2) Later Call Off s (Call O ff 2) : Experimental toxicity studies according  to the 
recommendations in Call Off 1 . These later Call offs should include (but not be limited  
to) experimental toxicity studies according to methods developed in Call off 1 (a) and/or 
b)), or as defined by Company with emission samples    
This r eport only concerns Call Off 1, and recommendations in this report will be used for 
suggesting studies proposed for Call Off 2.  
  
According to the ITTT for Call Off 1 the TQPAmine3 could be separated in the following two 
objectives:  
1) Establish a protocol for comparison of risk of different emission profiles from different 
solvent/supplier specific technologies    
11 
 
   
2) Establish a protocol that enables the assessment of a single substance risk approach for an 
emission profile; i.e. does the sum of the emission prof ile „s individual substances‟ risk 
measure up to the emission mixture overall risk, or are there synergistic effects or effects 
from non -identified substances.  
 
The major value of this project will be to propose integrated methods for sampling toxicity an d 
risk assessment to be used for health and environmental studies of emissions from the CO 2 
Capture Mongstad (CCM).  
 
The ITT describes one or more of the following endpoints as relevant:  
 
 Toxicological information – Mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, reprodu ctive toxicity 
(including developmental toxicity), actute toxicity, repeated dose toxicity, sub -chronic 
toxicity, sensitization, corrosion/irritation (skin and eye)  
 
Ecotoxicological information – Acute and/or chronic toxicity, biodegradation  
 
3.2 Important issues to consider  
The current project should be able to present a protocol for evaluation of emission mixture 
toxicity. Based on th e recommendations in this Call O ff 1 report , the Protocol should be ready 
for use after a Call Off 2 period . The time frame for a Call Off 2 has been suggested by 
Company to be ap proximately 6 months. It  was suggested by Company that recommendations 
made in the current report should be possible to establish within this 6 -month period. In addition, 
Company suggest ed to identify issues to consider for future investigations beyond the time fram 
of Call Off 2. Important issues to consider are described below  and are further elaborated in later 
sections of the report , as basis for our recommendations.  
 
3.2.1 Toxicity method s 
Within th e 6-monthg time frame of Call Off 2 no development of new test toxicity methods or 
protocols for toxicity will be possible. Only i nternationally a ccepted and validated methods , 
which are “ready to use” , should therefore be recommended . As descri bed later in this report  the 
“OECD Guidelines for Testing of Chemicals ” represent such a suite of accpted and validated test 
methods for human/mammal toxicity, ecotoxicity and biodegradation , describing the endpoints 
requested to be evaluated by Company.  
 
The Company recommend s the use of in vitro  methods , when possible. Advantages and 
disadvantages of in vitro  methods are discussed  later in the report, and it is concluded that in 
vitro  methods can not yet replace in vivo  methods. In addition, r elatively few in vitro  methods 
are currently available as validated OECD guidelines. In vitro  methods are often used as initial 
screening methods, which are supplemented by in vivo  tests, and in vivo  test methods are still 
essential for hazard and risk ass essment. In vitro  and in vivo  methods for genotoxicity and 
reproduction toxicity are discussed later in the report.    
12 
 
   
 
 
3.2.2 Flue gas emission toxicity and single substance approach  
The ITT suggest s an assessment of the suitability of using toxicity testing of f lue gas em issions 
alone and/or together with an individual substance risk approach.  
 
Testing of flue gas will mainly give information abou t the toxicity of the whole eff luent, but no 
or limited  information about individual compounds (ex cept some predomina nt compounds). If 
flue gas toxicity should be compared to single -substance approach it is essential that the 
toxicities  of the indiv idual compounds add up to repr esent the “toxicity” of the mixture in the 
flue gas (additive toxicity). Toxicity i nteractions  between compounds will complicate o r make 
the comparison impossible. In vivo  reactions, like metabolic activation, will also render the 
comparison between single substance and flue gas toxicity difficult or impossible in animal 
models.     
 
Validated meth ods, like the OECD Guidelines, are recommended for single compounds. If flue 
gas emissions are to be tested by these methods, modifications of test methods must be 
considered, and the se modified  test methods may not be regarded as validated methods any 
more. In addition, all validated toxicity methods are, to our knowledge, recommended  for water 
media, not for gaseous samples.  
  
Risk assessment is normally based on the to xicity of single compounds. Flue gas e mission 
toxicity ma y therefore be of limited value for risk  assessment . In addition, d ifferent flue gas 
compounds may have different fate after emission, so the distribution of compounds exposed to 
the population or the environment may be different from the flue gas composition  out of the 
stack .  
 
3.2.3 Risk and hazard assessment  
The ITT asks for a possible risk approach. A risk assessment  require s exposure concentrations.  
Since exposure concentrations, or methods for determination of these, are not available for this 
project  we do not have the tools to perfor m or suggest a complete risk assessment . However, a 
hazard evaluation is possible to perform, based on available toxicity data. A hazard assessment is 
important to perform before final toxicity test regimes are decided, based on lack of quality 
toxicity da ta. Data from a hazard assessment will be used as part of a complete risk assessment.  
 
3.2.4 Sampling methods  
In the ITT it is requested a protocol for sampling methods to be used for toxicity testing from 
water wash and flue gas emission samples.  
   
13 
 
   
Water wash samples will normally not be discharged to the environment, but circulated in the 
system. The need for toxicity testing of water wash samples may therefore be questioned, as 
discussed and concluded on later in the report.  
 
Flue gas sample extracts  will include  gaseous  and liquid phases , as well as particulates/aerosols. 
Common methods for emission sampling include steps to destruct  the sample, while toxicity 
testing will require non-destructed  samples. It is also advantageous  to sample all flue gas 
compounds in one phase, preferably as a liquid, since all validated toxicity test methods are 
recommended for water -based media.  This is further discussed in the report, with the 
recommendation of a sampling approach.

14 
 
   
4.2 Report organisation  
The main objective of the project was to propose approach(es ) and methods which can be used 
for  evaluations of health and environmental risk of emissions from post combustion amine based 
CO 2 capture . The report is o rganised in different chapters for:  
 
 Selection criteria for emission compounds  
 Human/mammalian toxicity methods, including hazard assessment  
 Ecotoxicity and biodegradation  
 Hazard and r isk assessment for health and environment  
 Flue gas sampling methods  
 
The various sections include results obtained in the current project and recommendations for Call 
Off 2.  
 
Recommended research requirements outside Call Off 2 are described in a separate chapter.  
 
Each chapter contains a number of elements, includin g summaries of relevant methods  and 
recommendations for the protocol. Where several options are availab le arguments are included 
for the choices made. For mammalian toxicity and ecotoxicity relevant methods are summarised  
and discussed in the main part of the report  and in Appendix C , while the principles of the 
individual methods  are presented in separate appendices  (Appendices D to F) .  
 
As a basis for hazard assessment we have surveyed available databases and scientific literature 
for relevant health and environmental data for a number of selected flue gas components, being 
representative for amine solven ts, aldehydes, amides, alkylamines, nitrosamines and nitramines. 
Summaries of these data are presented in the main part of the report, while complete data sets 
and references are found in separate appendices  (Appndices .  
 
Based on the summaries and evalua tions recommendations are made for the Protocol. This 
Protocol is placed in a separate Appendix to the report (Appendi ces H and I ).  
    
15 
 
   
 
5 Selection criteria of emission compounds and validated test methods for 
toxicity testing  
 
According to the ITT this pro ject should suggest toxicity testing strategy for emission mixtures 
from post combustion CO 2-capture. The request included both absorber flue gas emissions  and 
water wash  systems.  
 
5.1 Water wash systems  
In addition to absorption of evaporated amine solvents the water wash system may also trap 
various water soluble degradation products. However, volatile compounds like ammonia and 
alkylamines may no t be trapped in the water wash.  
 
The water wash efficiency  will affect the emissions in the flue gas. Water failure, or saturation of 
water wash with degradation products, may result in higher emissions  than expected in the flue 
gas. 
 
Compounds in the water wash are removed from the emission. Instead they are recycled back to 
the main solvent cycle, and will therefore not be released to the environment except by 
accidental discharges. We therefore do not regard compounds in the water wa sh system to pose 
any risk to the environment under normal process conditions. However, the water wash may be 
used for indirect measurements of toxic effects of the emissions. In theory, toxicity 
measurements of water wash samples may be used for determina tion of removal of flue gas 
toxicity prior to emission, since the waster wash system is placed in the top of the absorber (see 
Figure 2.1). However, this is very difficult to calculate.  
 
In addition, the water wash may represent water droplet entrained wi th the flue gas emissions, 
and the toxicity of the water wash may then in principle represent the toxicity of the water 
droplets in the flue gas. Once again, this will be very difficult to determine as part of the flue gas 
toxicity .  
 
We therefore decided not to focus on the effects of the water wash. However, risk assessment of 
water wash substances may be performd in the same way as described for the flue gas, by 
combining toxicity data for individual compounds with exposure concentrations, for example 
after accidental discharge incidents.   
 
 
5.2 Flue gas emissions  
As described above flue gas emissions are complex samples consisting of compounds distributed 
between gas, particulate and aerosol phases. As discussed in the previous chapter we can not   
16 
 
   
currently recommend that flue gas is used directly for toxicity testing due to the lack of available 
sampling methods.  
 
In our view toxicity testing of flue gas samples may be used for comparison of different samples. 
This may include testing of sample -to-sample va riations from individual duct systems 
(inhomogeneous samples, variations between planes and ports in a duct) and sample 
reproducibility (variations by time). However, this information may be provided by higher 
degree of certainty by chemical analyses.  
 
Toxicity analyses may also be used for comparison of emissions from various sources and 
technologies. These kinds of toxicity data may only be used for comparison of the toxicities of 
complete effluents. If toxicity data from flue gas samples should be relate d to the compounds 
measured by analytical tools extensive knowledge should be available about the toxicity 
mechanisms related to various endpoints. If experimental studies show that emission compounds 
elicit additive toxicity for the emission compounds and  high-quality data are available for 
essential emission compounds, these data may also be used for estimations of “unknown” 
compounds of toxicological importance.  
 
If emission toxicity testing should be performed, we suggest that only simple in vitro  toxicity test 
methods should be used , including both mammalian toxicity and ecotoxicity endpoints . This  is 
further discussed in cpt. 11 ). However, these methods are designed for pure compounds and not 
for emission mixtures, and revisions of methods may therefo re be required.  
 
Toxicity testing of emission mixtures can not be used for risk assessment and for testing of long -
term effects. After emissions several processes may change the compositions of the emissions. 
This includes both dispersion characteristics a nd degradation/transformation processes. Thus , 
emission mixture compositions will be changed from the stack to the point of human or 
animal /plant  exposure. The scope requested for risk assessment of flue gas emissions/emission 
compounds . However, we regard  emission  samples as unsuitable for risk a ssessment . We suggest 
a hazard assessment with the use of single compound strategies  in combination with non -
threshold approa ch, or the lowest acceptable exposure limits, as part of a risk evaluation  (see cpt. 
8). This may be supplemented at a later stage with a complete risk assessment, including 
emission data in combination with post -emission processes for the predictions of exposure 
concentrations .        
 
5.3 Single compound strategy   
From a toxicological point of view there are several reasons for using a single compound 
strategy instead of testing on real flue gas emissions consisting of multiple compounds, and 
where one compo und (ammonia) is quantitatively predominant:  
   
 Testing mixtures containing high levels of ammonia and low levels of other contaminants is a 
challenge. Exposure will primarily be limited to the inhalation and possibly oral route. The   
17 
 
   
irritat ive properties of ammonia will change the physiology of the ani mals as well as 
affect ing the uptake kinetics of other components in the test mix ture.  
 
 In vitro  testing of mixtures containing volatile compounds is extremely difficult , since it is 
difficult to maintain a stable exposure concentration over time. Further , if a major component 
of the mixture is either acidic or alkaline it will strongly affect most in vitro  tests. If not 
corrected through the use of appropriate buffers the test will merely become an indicator of 
what happens if the pH changes. If strong bu ffers are use, this has to be controlled through 
the use of controls.  
 
 Many chemicals in the flue gas mixture may interact with each other with the net result being 
a change in biological behaviour. Health wise, an important aspect of this is the production of 
nitrosamines from e.g. amines (Pitts et al.,  1978; Challis and Li, 1982) or nitramines 
(Churakov et al.,  1995) in a nitrogen rich atmosphere as well as endogenously (Vermeer et 
al., 1998, Fraser  et al.,  1980). However, to what extent this may occur is unknown.  
 If samples of flue gas are tested there will always be questions of whether that sample is 
representative of the effluent over time. There will be inevitable changes in production level, 
aging of the solvent and other processes which may consequently cause the composition of 
the flue gas to change.    
 
The single compound strategy is well known f rom toxicity evaluations of mixtures. For instance, 
the environmental impact factor (EIF) used fo r risk assessment of oil discharges to the marine 
environment is base d on toxicity evaluation of the single oil compounds, in combination with the 
predictions of the environmental concentrations of these compounds.  In the EIF the oil is 
separated into pse udo-compound groups and the toxicity of selected compounds representing 
each of these groups are used for defining ecotoxicity and fate of each pseudo -compound group 
(Johnsen et al., 2000)  
 
For human exposure we do test mixtures like e.g. consumer products  and pharmaceuticals. 
However, these are mixture where the product composition over time is carefully controlled and 
the result of testing is applicable to the product as long as it maintains the composition. For 
product with  changing composition, risk ass essments are usually based on evaluation of 
combinations of compounds where great care is taken to include those which may represent 
primary importance to public health.  
  
It is also of i mportan ce that all validated test methods are described for the testi ng of single 
compounds. If testing of emission mixtures or mixtures of single compounds should be 
performed this may therefore require modifications of test procedures according to the standard 
guidelines.    
18 
 
   
5.4 Collecting available data on flue gas compounds  
As analytical methods and knowledge about flue gas compound composition are increasing, the 
list of flue gas co mpounds may steadily increase. I n addition, the use of alternative solvents will 
also result in different degradation products both before and af ter emission. A large number of 
degradation products from different amine solvents have therefore been identified from different 
measuring campaigns, experimental studies, or by theoretical deductions . Some of the 
degradation products have been identified in the CO 2-capture system and others a fter emissions 
to the air (e.g. Strazisar et al. , 2003; Lepaumier et al., 2008, Bråthen et al.,  2008 ).  
 
To open up for new flue gas compounds we suggest that all compounds detected in monitoring 
or experimental studie s should be considered for toxicity evaluation . However, we also 
realise that some priority must be made, since some compounds are of more toxicological 
importance than other . In that respect we suggest a ranking system for toxicological 
evaluations of flu e gas compounds, ranked in importance from higher (t op) to lower (bottom) :  
 
1. High concentrations possible in emissions and potential effects related to mutagenic, 
carcinogenic and/or reproduction toxicity  (highest importance)  
2. High concentrations possible in emissions and potential for persistence, bioaccumulation and 
high ecotoxicity  
3. Low concentrations probable  in emissions and potential effects related to mutagenic, 
carcinogenic and/or reproduction toxicity  
4. Low concentrations probable  in emissions and potential for persistence, bioaccumulation and 
high ecotoxicity  
5. High concentrations possible in emissions, but no potential effects related to mutagenic, 
carcinogenic and/or reproduction toxicity, and no potential for persistence,  bioaccumulation 
and high ecotoxicity  
6. Low concentrations probable  in emissions  and no potential effects related to mutagenic, 
carcinogenic and/or reproduction toxicity, and no potential for persistence, bioaccumulation 
and high ecotoxicity  (lowest importan ce) 
 
Chemicals ranked within categories 1 to 4 should be tested if relevant HE -data are lacking or 
judged to be of inadequate quality (expert opinion).  
 
Before testing relevant information should be collected from number of sources:  
 
1. CAS number (if available). Cas number is used as for compound identification when 
searching for toxicological information  
2. Information on data from previous testing. This can be gathered from a number of 
databases described in Cpt. 6 and Cpt.  7 of this repo rt. 
3. Information on data from scientific literature, e.g. PubMed, SciFinder or Web of Science    
19 
 
   
4. List of chemicals registered or pre -registered in REACH. More than 140000 chemicals 
arranged by CAS -numbers are currently pre -registered in REACH for toxicity 
evaluations according to relevant endpoints for human end environmental toxicity. 
Registry process can be found on the homepages of the European Chemical Agency – 
ECHA ( http://echa.europa.eu/ ).   
If it is impossible to pla ce new compounds within one of the ranking categories 1 to 6 based on 
available testing information, the potential for the human health or environmental effects may be 
considered by the use of structure -activity relationships (SAR).  Health -related SAR inf ormation 
is further described in another TQP Amine project (TQP Amine 9 Alternative Approaches to 
Animal Toxicity Testing).  
 
Based on the collection of toxicological data informational gaps will be identified and testing 
will be suggested to fill these ga ps. For further information about testing, see cpt. 6 and 7 for 
health and environmental effects and methods, respectively.  
 
In the ITT a number of flue gas compound groups are described (see cpt. 2.2). We have no 
information about all possible compounds within each group. For hazard evaluation of complex 
mixtures it is common to use compounds representing the various groups. For instance, this is 
used for hazard and risk assessment of produced water from offshore installations (e.g. Johnsen 
et al.,  2000).  In this project we have used this approach and selected a number of substances 
identified as a case study for hazard evaluation  (Table 5.1) . These substances have all been 
detected, or are expected, in emissions from post combustion CO 2-capture , and they represent the 
compound groups described in the ITT:  
 
 Monoethanolamine (MEA) is chosen since this is a common primary solvent amine.  
 Ammonia is well documented to be the predominant compound in flue gas from amine -
based post -combustion CO 2 capture.  
 Aldehydes: Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are well -known degradation products of 
MEA (Knudsen, 2009; Sexton and Rochelle, 2008).  
 Amides: Acetamide is expected to be a stable degradation product of aliphatic amines 
(Bråthen et al., 2008).  
 Alkylamines : Methylamines have been observed experimentally in degradation tests 
where MEA has been exposed to NOx (Pedersen  et al. 2010) , and m ethylamine  has been 
a suggested degradation product of amines (Ro oney et al. , 1998)  
 Nitrosamines  and nitramines : NOx  may react with amines and nitrosamines and 
nitramines. The nitrosoamines (N-nitrosodimethylamine, N -nitrosodiethanolamine and 
N-nitrosomorpholine ) and nitramines (dimethylnitramine, ethano lnitramine and   
20 
 
   
methylnitramine) selected may form under process con ditions or after emission to air  
(Bråthen et al., 2008; da Silva et al. , in press) , although the appearance of all these 
compounds are not yet shown experimentally . 
With the emergence of new solvent strategies and knowledge about new degradation products 
we suggest that hazard evaluations should be performed on the individual compounds in the 
same way as described below.     
 
Table 5.1 Chemicals selected for representation of a flue gas emission sample from a 
CO 2 capture plant  
 
 
5.5 Transformation of compounds after emissions  
The flue gas composition may change after emission to the atmosphere. Immediately after 
emission the compounds are subjected to a number of processes in the atmosphere, including 
dispersion, partitioning between gas and rain water dropeltes and between gas  and aerosols  and   
degradation processes (photoly c degradation, hydrolysis ). The compounds may be precipitated 
by wet or dry processes and subjected to a number of abiotic or biotic processes in terrestrial or 
aquatic environments. These processes, and th eir implications for human or environmental 
toxicity, are outside the scope of the processes (see TQP Amine 4).  
 
However, post -emission processes are of major importance for risk evaluations.  It is therefore 
impossible to describe any realistic exposure conditions or scenarios this report.  
 
5.6 Validated test methods  
It is i mportant in this project to describe and recommend methods for health and environmental 
effects. Since the test methods described here should be used for regulatory purposes we regard Chemical Group  Name of the ch emical  CAS Numbers  
Amin e MEA  141-43-5 
NH3  NH3  7664 -41-7 
Aldehydes  Formaldehyde  50-00-0

as essential that these are generally accepted by the industry as well as national and international 
authorities. Probably the most important sources for such accepted methods in European 
countries are the validated methods  presented as Guidelines by the Orga nisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the International Standardization Organisation 
(ISO). However, t he OECD guidelines are more accessible than the ISO standards , since the 
latter require pre -payment before accession .  
 
OECD is an  intergovernmental organisation with representatives of 30 industrialised countries in 
North America, Europe and the Pacific, as well as the European Commission. Most of the 
OECD's work is carried out by specialised Committees and subsidiary groups compose d of 
Member country delegates, and the work of the OECD related to chemical safety is carried out in 
the Environment, Health and Safety Programme. As part of its work on chemical testing, the 
OECD has issued several Council Decisions and Recommendations (t he former legally binding 
on member countries), as well as numerous Guidance Documents and technical reports. The 
OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals are a collection of the most relevant 
internationally agreed test methods used by government, ind ustry and independent laboratories to 
determine the safety of chemicals and chemical preparations, including pesticides and industrial 
chemicals. They cover validated tests for the physical -chemical properties of chemicals, human 
health effects, environmen tal effects, and degradation and accumulation in the environment. The 
OECD Test Guidelines are recognised world -wide as the standard reference tool for chemical 
testing. More information about the Environment, Health and Safety Programme and its 
publicatio ns (including the Test Guidelines) is available on the OECD‟s World Wide Web site 
http://www.oecd.org/ehs/ .  
  
Validated methods (like OECD test guidelines) are thoroughly tested, and by following the given 
recommenda tions, it is to be expected good reproducibility, together with the use of 
recommended references, standards, good laboratory practice (GLP), approved statistical 
methods, etc.  
OECD guideline methods usually provide information about recommended statistic al approaches 
and how the data should be interpolated. The OECD also provides a number of guidance 
documents on ecotoxicity testing methods  (REF: http://www.oecd.org/document/30/  0,3343, en_ 
2649_34377_1916638_1_1_1_1,00.html).  
In the EU, the promotion of alternative methods is increasingly favoured at the expense of 
conventional animal testing. Similar developments for the promotion of alternative methods can 
be observed in other industrialized regions such as USA and Japan. They are coordinated by 
OECD at the international level (e. g. OECD 1990, 1996, 2005a). As  a consequence of the EU 
Directive 86/609 /EEC, in 1991 the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods 
(ECVAM) was founded which has become a unit of the Joint Research Centre of the EU 
Commission in Ispra, Italy, since 1992. Normally , new alternative methods are validated by 
ECVAM,  or by other relevant facilities like the Japanese Centre for the Validation of Alternative 
Methods ( JaCVAM ), or the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of   
22 
 
   
Alternative Methods at the National Toxicology Program ( ICCVAM) , before OECD starts  the 
validating process.  
 
In this project we consider only OECD validated methods as acceptable validated methods for 
the testing strategy (Lilienblum et al., 2008).  
 
5.7 Expert judgment  
 
Expert judgment is recommended for several of several decisions related  to hazard assessment 
and selection of test methods in the chepter below. By “expert judgment” we suggest –  
 
 Competent people on toxicity/ ecotoxicity/biodegradation methods, i.e. experts from 
relevant testing laboratories or actively working scientifi ste in toxicology and 
ecotoxicology  
 Competent people on flue gas emission s from CCS, i.e. experts on sampling and 
analysis, and post -emission processes like dispersion and environmental fate (e.g. 
atmospheric processes)  
  
 
 
    
23 
 
   
 
6 Human/mammalian toxicity data  
6.1  Human/mammalian toxicity data for hazard assessment  
The terms “Hazard” has been defined by OECD and by REACH (e.g. 
http://guidance.echa.europa.eu/docs/guida nce_document/information_requirements_en.htm ). 
Hazard is commonly defined a s "the potential to cause harm" and can be defined as "a property 
or situation that in particular circumstances could lead to harm" (EEA, 1998).  
 
Health effects are important to co nsider for hazard assessment in many areas, such as hygiene, 
pollution studies, workplace safety, nutrition and health sciences in general. Some of the major 
environmental sources of health effects are air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination, 
noise pollution and over -illumination.  
 
Health effects related to CO 2-capture technologies are mainly related to emissions of potentially 
hazardous components through flue gas from the absorber.  Flue gas composition and 
components concentrations will part ly depend on solvent technology and cleaning of flue gas 
prior to emission.  
 
Potential health effects are evaluated by toxicity studies using animals or cell cultures from 
mammal species. Various endpoints are used to cover a variety of possible toxic res ponses, as 
described in the Tender Invitation:  
 
 Mutagenicity/genotoxicity  
 Carcinogenetic effects  
 Reproduction toxicity and developmental toxicity  
 Acute toxicity  
 Repeated dose toxicity (chronic toxicity)  
 Subchronic toxicity  
 Sensitization  
 Irritation/corrosi on of skin and eyes  
 
6.1.1 Principles of evaluation  
In the present project exposure to humans may occur in an occupational setting or as a result of 
chemicals being dispersed to the neighbourhood of the production plant. Any controversy as to 
exposure limits etc will most probably be focused on the neighbou rhood environment. Exposure 
to the general population around an industrial facility like Mongstad is characterised by low -
level continuous exposure. Thus, acute, oral and dermal toxicity will play a minor role in the 
final overall assessment. Acute (4 hour s) inhalation data will of course be important in any 
setting where atmospheric exposure is the prime source. However, acute short term exposure at 
relatively high concentrations may not be a good indicator of health hazards which may occur 
after low level  and long term exposure. We therefore need to focus on compounds causing   
24 
 
   
effects that may occur after long -term and low -level exposure. At low level and long term 
exposure the following health hazards will be of prime interest when regulations are set for 
permissible exposure to population at or near a plant:  
 
 Carcinogenicity (C)  
 Mutagenicity (M)  
 Reproductive effects (R)  
 Sensitization, primarily by inhalation (S)  
 
We therefore regard mutagenicity /genotoxicity , carcinogenicity , reproduction toxicity  
and sensitization as the most important endpoints to consider.  
 
6.1.2 Types of toxicity testing  
Acute toxicity deals with the adverse effects of single doses. It establishes the relationship 
between dose and adverse effects and can be used to compare the relative toxici ty and calculate a 
median lethal dose. Such studies can therefore identify highly toxic chemicals and provide 
information on the possible hazards. Dosing periods lying between the single dose and 10 per 
cent of lifespan dosage are often called subacute.  
 
Sub-chronic testing, on the other hand, can identify the toxic effects associated with repeated 
doses of a chemical over part of an average lifespan of experimental animals. It can detect the 
delayed effects which may occur due to accumulation of the chemic al in tissues or by other 
mechanisms. These studies will provide detailed information on toxic effects, target organs, 
reversibility of effects and an indication of a „no effect level‟. The division between subchronic 
and chronic dosing regimes is sometime s taken as 10 per cent of the test animal‟s lifespan. In 
general, the longer the sub -chronic study, the more information is likely to be gained.  
6.1.3 Explanation for classification of long term health hazards  
Explanation for classification of long term health hazards is adopted from GESAMP -EHS: 
http://www.gesamp.org/publications/publicationdisplaypages/rs64  
 
The symbol C, M, R and S i ndicate:  
C Shown to induce or increase cancer in animals or man  
M Shown to cause increased incidence of permanent changes in the amount or 
structure of the genetic material  
R Shown to cause adverse effects on reproductive ability or capacity, or the 
deve lopment of offspring  
S Shown to be a sensitizer (skin or respiratory)  
 
Carcinogenic  
The term carcinogenic denotes substances or mixtures that are presumed to induce cancer or to 
increase its incidence in humans. Evidence to substantiate the notation “carcinogenic” should be   
25 
 
   
available from epidemiological studies and/or from well conducted  studies in experimental 
animals. On a case by case basis, scientific judgment may warrant a decision of presumed human 
carcinogenicity (C) derived from studies showing limited evidence in humans with limited 
evidence in experimental animals.    
 
Mutagenic  
A mutation is a permanent change in the amount or structure of the genetic material in a cell. The 
term mutation applies to genetic changes both for somatic cells and for germ cells that may give 
rise to subsequent adverse changes at the phenotypic level.  The term mutagenic denotes 
substances or mixtures that can give rise to an increased occurrence of mutations in vivo , in 
populations of cells and/or organisms. Evidence to substantiate a notation of “mutagenicity” (M) 
is normally provided from studies con ducted in vivo on mammalian somatic cells or germ cells. 
It is recognized that genetic events are central in the overall process of cancer development. 
Therefore, evidence of mutagenicity indicates that a substance has a potential to induce 
carcinogenic ef fects.  
 
Reprotoxic  
Reproductive toxicity includes adverse effects on sexual function and fertility in adult males and 
females or on the development of the offspring. The notation “reprotoxic” (R) includes 
substances for which there is reliable evidence fro m human experience or from experimental 
animals of an adverse effect on reproductive ability, capacity, or on development of the offspring 
in the absence of other toxic effects.  
 
Sensitizer  
The term sensitizing denotes substances or mixtures, which can ind uce a condition of 
hypersensitivity in individuals following inhalation (respiratory sensitizer) or skin contact 
(contact sensitizer). Evidence to substantiate a notation of “sensitizing” (S) should be available 
from human experience and/or from appropriat e studies using experimental animals. The term 
photosensitizing (Sp) denotes substances or mixtures that require light to become active and may 
subsequently induce a condition of contact sensitivity. Evidence to substantiate the notation of 
“photosensitizi ng” should be available from human experience and/or from appropriate studies 
using experimental animals.  
 
6.1.4 Classification of long term health hazards  
There are two internationally recognized hazard classification systems available; GESAMP -EHS 
and GHS (Glob al Harmonized System). The first is primarily for maritime transport of chemicals 
while the last forms the basis of the UN system for recognition of transport hazards as well as 
R/S-sentences. GESAMP is the oldest system and classifies chemicals for enviro nmental fate, 
ecotoxicology and human hazards. The GESAMP and GHS classifications are almost identical, 
the main differences being:  
 The classification numbering is opposite (a rating of 4 is the most toxic in GESAMP 
while it is the least toxic in GHS)    
26 
 
   
 Ther e are minor differences in cut -off values for acute toxicity  
 There are some compounds classified as slightly irritant to skin and eye in GESAMP 
which are not classified as irritants in GHS  
 There are a few compounds classified as C, M or R in GESAMP without  similar rating in 
GHS  
 
The GESAMP classification system was adopted for this report as one member of the 
project team was member of the GESAMP group of experts for 24 years and have 
extensive experience with this system. The outcome of the hazard evaluation for relevant 
flue gas chemicals would be the same regardless of whether GESAMP or GHS is used.  
 
In addition, t he CLP (Classification, labelling and packaging) system has been approved in EU 
and Norway . This system  is mainly relevant for classification of compounds to be transported. 
Therefore, t he CLP system is not used for the current project,  since it is not relevant for 
emissions to the environment.  Both GESAMP and EHS systems are used to sort and classify 
chemi cal hazards and are relevant for the current report.  
  
6.1.5 Flue gas compounds used for hazard assessment  
In the current project some chemicals were selected (Refer Chapter 5 for selection of 
compounds) for the representation of the components of a flue gas emi ssion (Table 5.1). In brief, 
the chemicals have either been detected in emissions from CO2 -capture systems based on amine 
solvent technologies, or are of concern as potential amine degradation products.  Health and 
environmental data were collected for the se chemicals for preliminary hazard assessments.   
6.1.5.1  Literature search on potential flue gas chemicals  
We did a literature search on flue gas substances chemicals in the following databases:

We also included search on the TOXNET  (TOXicology Data NETwork) . This  is a cluster of 
databases covering toxicology, hazardous chemicals, environmental health and related areas. It is 
managed by the Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program  (TEHIP) in the 
Division of Specialized Information Services  (SIS) of the National Library of Medicine  (NLM) .

ChemIDplus.  
 
TOXNET databases are accessible free of charge at: http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov / 
 
From these databases, information was obtained for all the chemicals ( see Table 5.1) except 
ethanolnitramine (74386 -82-6). The followi ng table (Table 6 .2) shows a list of chemicals and 
source of information.  
 
 
6.1.5.2  Preparation of summary sheets  
The information obtained from the databases was used to prepare a summary sheet for each of 
these compounds (Appendix H). The summary sheet contains i nformation about oral, 
percutaneous, inhalation, skin and eye irritation and other long term effects. The source of 
databases and GESAMP profile is also given in the summary sheets for each chemical.  
GESAMP is an organization for cooperation between sever al UN organizations (UNEP, FAO, 
UNESCO, IOC, WHO, WMO, IMO, IAEA). GESAMP/EHS was established in 1974 and have 
carried out detailed examination on roughly 3000 compounds and products carried at sea. The 
GESAMP classification is carried out by a team of int ernational experts on chemistry, marine 
ecotoxicity and human health hazard assessment. The experts are invited by IMO (International 
Maritime Organization) on behalf of GESAMP. Their classification has been published as the 
GESAMP Composite list by IMO. T he GESAMP/EHS review is based on public records as well 
as confidential company information. In some cases laboratory reports from the toxicity studies 
have been examined. The files supporting the decisions of the GESAMP/EHS group is located at 
IMO, London , UK.

Sensitization (S) sheets were prepared for each individual study (refer appendix H).  
 
Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity sheets:  
For this toxicity, results from individual studies should be divided into two broad categories: 
mutag enic (genotoxic) and carcinogenic.  
Reproductive effects sheets:  
Broadly, reproductive toxicology is defined as any adverse effect on any aspect of adult male or 
female sexual function and fertility, or on the conceptus or on lactation, which would interf ere 
with the production or development of normal offspring which could be reared to sexual 
maturity, capable in turn of reproducing the species. For the Amine 3 project, individual studies 
were divided into thre e broad categories: male/female reproduction capacity, fetotoxicity and 
fetal development which can be defined as follows: (i)  male/female reproduction capacity: 
adverse effects on reproductive ability or capacity in adult males and females, that is, effects on 
sexual behaviour and fertility; (ii) fe totoxicity: adverse effects on maintenance of pregnancy 
(which includes no. of implantations, post implantation loss, counting of corpora lutea, duration 
of gestation, still births, runts etc. ) (iii) fetal development: developmental outcome 
(teratogenicity  and postnatal evaluations) of the offspring.  
Sensitization sheets:  
For sensitization, individual studies should be categorized into inhalation and percutaneous 
studies.  
6.1.5.4  Ratings for the chemicals  
All the chemicals were classified and rated for each of the  endpoints. For classification and 
numerical rating, the definitions used by GESAMP/EHS have been used. Individual studies from 
RTECS, IUCLID and other databases were rated in Columns C1, C2, C3, D1, D2, D3 according 
to GESAMP classification. From the GESA MP profile and ratings obtained from individual 
studies for each chemical, conclusions on oral, dermal, inhalation and long term effects were 
made which were presented as expert judgment at the end of summary sheets for each individual 
chemical (Refer appe ndix H for summary sheets).  
 
A GESAMP classification system used for preparing summary sheets for potential flue gas 
compounds is shown below (Table 6 .3).

6.2 Methods available for  toxicity testing  
6.2.1 Method sources    
Standard validated methods for human related mammalian toxicity studies are described in a 
number of databases:  
 
 OECD Guidelines for Testing of  Chemicals http://www.oecd -ilibrary.org/environment/oecd -
guidelines -for-the-testing -of-chemicals -section -4-health -effects_20745788  
 ECVA M - European  Centre  for th e Validatio n of Alternative Methods 
(http://ecvam.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ )  
 JaCVAM - Japanese Centre  for the Validation of Alternative Methods 
(http://jacvam.jp/en/index.html ) 
 ICCVAM - Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods at 
the National Toxicology Program ( http://iccvam.niehs.nih.gov/ ) 
6.2.2 Search for methods for carcino genicity and mutagenicity  
We searched ECVAM, JaCVAM and ICCVAM for validated methods (both for in vitro and in 
vivo methods) suitable for testing acute toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of the 
compounds  listed in table 6 .2. The tables  6.5 and 6 .6 lists validated test methods ( in vitro  and in 
vivo) for testing carcinogenicity and mutagenicity. Also methods for oral/chronic oral/inhalation 
were assessed in order to get an overview of adverse effects and an estimate of dosages for further 
toxicity ass ays ( 6.7). It should be noted that a few methods have passed ECVAM, JaCVAM and 
ICCVAM validation, and are in waiting list to obtain OECD guideline number. We also searched 
for methods or their modifications for specific type of toxicity (phototoxicity, non -genotoxic 
carcinogens, etc).

6.2.4 Search for methods for sensitization testing  
Inhalation sensitization: To our knowledge, there are no validated methods for testing 
sensitization from exposure via inhalation. OECD has TG 413, which measures subchronic  
inhalation toxicity and is a 90 day study which measures subchronic inhalation toxicity after 
repeated exposure via inhalation route for 28 days. It can be used for determi ning NOAEL (no-
observable adverse effect level) and LOAEL (lowest observable adverse effect level), but does not 
provide any indication of sensitization.  
  
Skin sensitization: For sensitization via skin exposure, OECD recommends a two tier testing. The 
first tier consists testing of chemical with TG 429 using Ly mph node assay or Mouse ear swelling 
test. If no definite answer is obtained from the above then TG 406 - Guinea pig maximization test 
is recommended.  
  
6.3 Consideration of methods for mammalian/human toxicity testing  
6.3.1 Important points to consider for selecting  appropriate methods  
There are few important points to consider for the selection of appropriate methods for testing 
genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity concerning potential flue gas compounds 
like nitrosamines  and nitramines : 
   
39 
 
   
 Nitrosam ines can be converted to nitramines in the atmosphere primarily via reaction with 
the hydroxyl radical, reaction with ozone, and photolysis (Tuazon et al., 1984)  
  
 Nitramines can be reduced (deaminated) to formaldehyde and ammonia both in vivo  and in 
vitro , and this process is reported to be responsible for the carcinogenicity of nitramines, 
(Frie et al., 1984)  
 
This indicates the need for a metabolic activation system or appropriate metabolic system 
(metabolically active cells or feeder cells) for assessi ng the toxicity of nitramines and 
nitrosamines.  
 
Most of the compounds described in Table 6.4 are likely to be mutagenic. If they are carcinogenic 
they will be mutagenic carcinogens except for ammonia (tumour promoter) and formaldehyde 
which may act genot oxic, but also likely as promoter.  It is important to choose methods and 
endpoints which may identify genotoxic endpoints on different levels (DNA breakage, base 
damage, point mutations, larger mutagenic and clastogenic changes as well as disruptions in c ell 
divisions). For testing of carcinogenicity it is important to address both initiation of 
carcinogenicity (genotoxic effects) as well as non -genotoxic carcinogenicity (promotions, 
proliferation, progression). Literature reviews have shown that these com pounds are likely to 
release photooxidative products, and thus photogenotoxicity should be also addressed.  Photoxicity 
has been a biological indicator of nitrosamine activity (Nishie et al ., 1972). Studies in Ames 
bacteria ( Salmonella typhimurium ) have indicated that UVA -irradiation of N -dialkylnitrosamines 
releases nitric oxide, with subsequent production  of alkyl radical cations and active oxygen 
species which cause DNA strand breaks, oxidative and alkylative DNA damage and mutation 
(Arimoto -Kobayashi et al., 2010).  
 
For reproduct ive toxicity, in the nirosamine  group, the data from N -nitrosodimethylamine (62 -75-
9) indicated that it is a confirmed reprotoxic chemical with main effects being observed as 
fetotoxicity (Refer appendix H for R sheets). This suggests the need for th e methods which are 
mainly focu sed upon measuring fetotoxic effects.  
6.3.1.1  General considerations of in vitro  tests 
Currently available in vitro  tests are accepted by regulatory bodies mostly for genotoxicity testing. 
It has been suggeste d that they can be used in future to determine the starting dose of  in vivo  
studies, assist in evaluation of data from animal studies especially in identification of species 
differences, or to increase understanding of the toxicological mechanism of action  of the 
substance. They cannot be used to replace testing in animals completely, although this may be 
possible in the future. In vitro data may be useful for predicting acute toxicity in humans and a 
range of tests have been investigated that permit calcul ation of an IC50 (inhibitory concentration 
50%) value, though none are yet approved by OECD. It has been suggested that the results of in 
vitro cytotoxicity tests may be good  predict or of acute oral toxicity in humans , based on rat or 
mouse data (Kinsner -Ovaskainen et al., 2009). However, this aspect needs to be further 
investigated.  
 
Main advantages of in vitro  test methods:  
 3R (Reduce, refine and replace the use of animals for toxicity testing)  
 Easy  
 Cheap  
 Less time consuming  
 Good for studying mechanisms  of toxicity at molecular and cellular level  
 Potentially robust    
40 
 
   
 High throughput: it is possible to test hundreds of chemicals in a short time , and it is 
possible to combine them with chip or robotic technology for performing or evaluation of 
the results    
 Specific types of toxicity can be studied such as photogenonotoxicity  
 Human primary cells (e.g. lymphocytes) or stable cell lines can be used which might be 
closer to humans than animal systems  
 Some assays can be adopted for fast in situ screening (in exposed environment for 
biomonitoring)    
 
 
Major disadvantages of in vitro  models and test methods:  
 Major disadvantage is that toxicokinetic  studies can not be perform by using in vitro  
system  
 Most of the tests use a prediction model for correlating in vivo  and in vitro  data 
experimental data. For in vitro  data these prediction models depend upon the concentration 
curves which are highly dependent upon factor like e.g. the cell density, serum 
conc entration and quality of the media. A slight change in any of the factors may result in 
a shift in the concentration curves and incorrect use of in vitro data in combinations with  
in vivo  experiments  
 Correlation of experimental data ( in vitro  and in vivo )  with human data is very 
challenging even in cases where human primary cells or cell lines derived from humans 
are  used  
 There is a lack of metabolic activation for some in vitro  systems that can be partly 
overcome by using external metabolic systems (fe eder cells or co -cultivation with potent 
metabolically active cells, S9 fraction, using metabolically active cells and cell lines).   
 Current in vitro  methods for testing reproduction toxicity either do not include metabolic 
activation or introduction of m etabolic systems is not yet included in the validation 
program. Presence of metabolic activation system is relevant for testing the toxicity of 
nitrosamines and nitramines.  
 Testing volatile chemicals and airborne particles in vitro  is a major technical cha llenge if 
the test represents inhalation toxicology

6.3.4 Testing strategy considerations for testing carcinogenicity and mutagenicity  
For ge notoxicity/ mutagenicity, three different in vitro  tests are usually initially chosen for 2 -3 
different endpoints, usually both prokaryotic and eukaryotic tests. If 2 out of 3 tests are positive , 
then the c ompound is considered genotoxic  and likely to be carcinogenic. Mutagenicity refers to 
the induction of permanent transmissible changes in the amount or structure of the genetic 
material of cells or organisms. Genotoxicity is a broader term and refers to processes which alter 
the structure, information content or segregation of DNA and are not necessarily  associated with 
mutagenicity.  
 
In vivo  acute toxicity tests are unavoidable even if in vitro  test data exist. Today there are 
improved and combined methods for in vivo  toxicity tests, where more data can be gathered with 
fewer animals tested. For example the previous OECD 401 method for oral toxicity (LD50) is 
now improved into the OECD 420, 423 and 425 methods. An option to reduce the number of 
animal is to include the new OECD draft TG “ Using cytotoxicity tests to estimate starting doses 
for acute oral s ystemic toxicity tests” after being approved  by OECD.  The acute toxicity results 
give an estimate of dosages for further endpoint testing.  
 
The initial in vitro  genotoxicity/mutagenicity tests are generally followed by in vivo  
genotoxicity/mutagenicity  tests, before any long term animal testing are initiated. If the outcome   
43 
 
   
is positive, further long -term carcinogenicity testing might be considered unnecessary  to avoid  
suffering of animals. If the outcome is negative, then the compound might be a non -genotoxic 
carcinogen, and further long term carcinogenicity testing is initiated.  
 
6.3.5 Consideration of validated in vitro  tests for reproduction toxicity  
Table 6.11 shows a list of validated in vit ro methods. OECD has two in vitro  validated tests which 
measure the hormonal activity as their endpoint. The ECVAM validated tests assess the embryo 
and developmental toxicity.

Below is a list of validated in vivo  methods with their main emphasis of different categories of

From this list, it can be seen that there are four relevant methods (OECD - 415, 416, 421, 422) 
which measure the fetotoxicity in addition to reproductive and developmental effects. We 
therefore, focused on the advantages and disadvantages of these four met hods (Table 6.13).  
 
From table 6.13, it can be seen that OECD test method 422 measures several aspects of 
fetotoxicity and uses fewer animals (10 animals of each sex for 3 treatment groups and control) 
when compared to combination of OECD 407 (5 animals of  each sex for 3 treatment groups and 
control) and 421 (10 animals of each sex for 3 treatment groups and control).  
 
6.4 Recommendations for Call Off 2 - Hazard assessment  
 
A list of chemicals was selected to represent each chemical group mentioned in the scope of 
TQPamine 3. The reasons for selection of chemicals and testing of single compounds have been 
described in chapter 5 . Hazard assessment of these potential flue gas co mpounds was performed 
and is provided in Table 6.4. The hazard assessment of these compounds provided knowledge 
about where data on the compounds are available, needed or missing. In order to fill the gaps 
where information is needed or missing, we recomme nd testing of 8 compounds. Out of these 8 
compounds, we recommend 4 compounds for C testing, 4 compounds for M testing and 6 
compounds for R testing. A list of compounds recommended for C, M or R testing are 
summarized in a table shown below (Table 6.14)

which are still not known should be done.  
 
6.5 Recommendations for the protocol - Methods  
The methods described below for C, M and R testing are recommended as general test strategies 
for degradation products of amine technology.  Since a tier system has been recommended for 
testing, some of the described methods may take more than 6 months time  period (time frame for 
Call Off 2) for completion.   
6.5.1 Recommendation of methods for testing mutagenicity/genotoxicity and 
carcinogenicity  
The recommendations described below are based on testing of chemicals lacking all necessary 
data for mutagenicity, geno toxicity and carcinogenicity. When relevant data are available the 
quality of the data should be judged before decisions of testing are made. Data information should 
be based on testing by validated methods (OECD) and by GLP -approved test laboratories.  
  
6.5.1.1  Step-by-step testing  
A recommendation for a step -by-step procedure for safety evaluation of CO 2 capture flue gas 
compounds is shown in Table 6.15.  
 
Step 1:  
 
 
Table 6.15a Strategy for acute toxicity.  
Step 1, Acute Single Dose Toxicity  
 Rational for choice of method(s)  
OECD 425   Up-and-Down Procedure for acute 
oral toxicity testing.  There are a limit test and a main test. 
The limit test can be used efficiently 
to identify chemicals that are likely 
to have low toxicity. LD50 values 
are calculated and it is possible to 
compute confidence intervals. This 
test is more used for environmental 
chemicals and unknown chemicals.  
  
   
47 
 
   
Step 2:  
 
Perform 3 in vitro genotoxicity tests, addressing 3 different endpoints in this order:  
a) OECD 471  
b) OECD 487 or 473  
c) OECD 476 
 
Knowledge about the metabolic profile of a substance indicates that the standard in vitro tests are 
not sufficiently reassuring and a further in vitro test, or an in vivo test, may be needed in order to 
ensure mutagenicity potential is adequately expl ored. An metabolic activation alternative to rat 
liver such as S -9 mix, or  a metabolically active cell line like HepG2 cells or genetically 
engineered cell lines should be used to test „amine 3‟ compounds.

tumo r multiplicity, potential for 
metastasis.  
 
 If positive results, substance is considered  a carcinogen.  
 If negative results,  If negative results, substance is considered non-genotoxic  
 We recommend R testing for C positive compounds due to the following reasons:  
 
1) There are certain compounds such as few phthalates which although being C 
negative have R effects through their hormone mimicking action.  The release 
in question does not contain phthalates, but a range of other compounds in flue 
gas which might  interfere with hormone levels. So there might be some 
compounds in the flue gas which are C negative but R positive.  
2) Compounds that are both C and R positive will be of more concern to the 
public than C positive only compounds. We would recommend the comp any to 
prepare a dossier as complete as possible to avoid any criticism in the future.  
 
6.5.1.2  Rational for choice of methods for testing mutagenicity/genotoxicity and 
carcinogenicity  
In vitro cytotoxicity tests  for determination of IC50 can in some cases be used to estimate LD50 or 
LC50. They are not proposed in here as they are not yet OECD validated. However, the OECD 
draft guidance document on using cytotoxicity tests to estimate starting doses for acute oral  
systemic toxicity tests should be taken into consideration once OECD validated.  
Acute toxicity tests.  The OECD 425 tests for oral exposure were chosen by us for determination of 
median lethal dose (LD50). Concentrations obtained are used for setting dosa ges for further 
toxicity tests.  
In vitro genotoxicity tests.  Apart from being a validated commonly used gene mutation method for 
prokaryotes, the OECD 471 Ames method has been used often for relevant flue gas compounds 
with positive outcome, like alkylamin es, nitrosamines and nitramines, therefore we chose OECD 
471. The OECD 476 method is the only validated gene mutation method for mammalian cells, 
and it has been used to prove mutagenicity of compounds relevant for flue gas emissions (e.g. 
alkylamines and nitrosamines).  The OECD 473 assay has been proposed for chromosomal 
damage analysis as it has been used with positive outcome for nitrosamine (N -nitrosomorpholine).   
50 
 
   
The In vitro  Comet assay is very promising, quick, inexpensive, easy to perform, well estab lished 
in many laboratories and is under validation by ECVAM. Final validation study is expected in 
autumn 2010, and submission of validation results and draft TG is expected early 2011 
(https://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/22/61/41339719.pdf).   Therefore we prop ose to wait for 
finalization of the JaCVAM validation study before including it to the strategy. The OECD 487 
micronucleus method was chosen as it is widely used and pick up true positives. The OECD 479 
(SCE) and 482 (UDS) methods are either not specific, error prone and/or complicated to perform, 
so we do not recommend these methods. The OECD 480 and 481 methods of gene mutations in 
Saccharomyces,  were not chosen to be of primary interest due to the possibility of species specific 
differences.  
In vivo geno toxicity tests.  The OECD 474 In vivo  micronucleus test and 475 in vivo  chromosome 
aberration test are both validated and commonly used method. They have also both been used 
with positive result for the compounds of relevance for flue gas emissions (nitrosa mines). The in 
vivo comet assay is in final stage of validation by ECVAM/JaCVAM but was not chosen as it is 
not yet OECD validated. It is very promising method that can detect DNA damage in different 
organs and tissues (liver, blood, lung, e tc.) and. The OECD 477 method with gene mutations in 
Drosophila , was not chosen to be of primary interest due to the possibility of species specific 
differences. The OECD 478, 483, 484 and 485 methods have not been previously documented to 
be particularly u seful for validation of relevant flue gas compounds and were therefore not 
chosen. The OECD 486 UDS in vivo method is an old, rough assay, not specific for DNA damage 
or repair, and the outcome of this test is uninformative. We therefore do not recommend t his 
method.  
In vitro carcinogenicity test. The Cell Transformation assays are the only currently available in 
vitro alternative methods to in vivo  carcinogenicity tests. They are very promising and should be 
taken into consideration if OECD approves the dr aft guideline.  
In vivo carcinogenicity test. The OECD 453 method is recommended in our strategy. It is an 
alternative method where the OECD 451 and 452 methods are combined. We selected OECD 453 
method as it is time and cost effective, and uses fewer anim als. In addition, it addresses both 
chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity in the same assay.  
6.5.1.3  Relevance for using the recommended methods for testing 
mutagenicity/genotoxicity and carcinogenicity  
The methods chosen address specific endpoints that are highl y relevant for the type of damage we 
expect from these compound, either gene mutations (OECD 471 and 476) or chromosomal 
damage (OECD 473 and 487). The step -by-step strategy is relevant for avoiding unnecessary 
experiments by estimating the dosages and the  toxicity with simpler assays in vitro (e.g. OECD 
471, 476 or 487 and 473), and thereby reducing the costs and the number of animals in the in vivo 
tests (e.g. OECD 474 and OECD 475). Finally the long term toxicity tests (Step 3) are 
recommended to be perf ormed only after judging the outcome from the genotoxicity tests (Step 1 
and 2), which also contributes to reducing time, cost and animals.    
51 
 
   
6.5.2 Recommendation of methods for testing reproduction toxicity  
We recommend a two tier study for testing th e reproduct ion toxicity (Table 6 .16).  Some of the 
recommended flue gas compounds for reproduction toxicity testing (see Table 6.14) have shown 
to be fetotoxic (refer R sheets in appendix H) and have a high oral toxicity and inhalation toxicity, 
e.g. the nitrosamine N-nitrosodimethylamine. This chemical may therefore be included as a 
positive standard and a benchmark on dose. The tier 1st includes a standard OECD test 425 for 
determining the LD50 of the chemical where no previous LD50 data is available. This should be  
followed by OECD test 422 for testing fetotoxicity. The outcome of the 1st tier will determine the 
need for a 2nd tier where a detailed study with any one or two of the OECD test methods 415 and 
416 should be performed. Test evaluation forms of the recomm ended methods are described in 
Appendix D.

6.5.2.1  Rational for choice of methods for testing reproduction toxicity  
Hazard evaluation of reprotox  data from nitrosamines group suggests that it has main effects on 
fetotoxicity. Based on this data, we can presume that the rest of the nitrosamines in the group 
(1116 -54-7 and 59 -89-2) are fetotoxic as well.  
 
In vitro  methods: OECD and ECVAM validated in vitro  tests do not measure fetotoxic effects in 
particular and do not include metabolic activation. However, metabolic activation may be relevant 
for potential flue gas compounds like nitrosamines and nitramines, and we therefore propose the 
use of in vivo test methods for testing the reproduction toxicity of nitramines and nitrosamines.  
 
In vivo  methods: Since very little or no information on acute toxicity or repeated dose toxicity is 
available for most of the recommended compounds for reproduction toxi city testing, some initial 
acute toxicity data or repeated dose toxicity testing needs to be done. This can be done with 
OECD test method 425 for acute oral toxicity or OECD 407 for repeated dose toxicity. Both 
OECD test methods 421 and 422 measure several  aspects of fetotoxicity, however OECD test 
method 422 is a combination of OECD 407 (5 animals of each sex for 3 treatment groups and 
control) and 421 (10 animals of each sex for 3 treatment groups and control). It uses fewer 
animals (10 animals of each se x for 3 treatment groups and control) when compared to 
combination of OECD 407 (5 animals of each sex for 3 treatment groups and control) and 421 (10 
animals of each sex for 3 treatment groups and control). Therefore we recommend OECD test 
method 422 which  would provide information on dose concentration and fetotoxicity and is in 
accordance with reduction of animals for toxicity testing.  
6.5.3 Recommendation of methods for Sensitization  
We will not recommend including sensitization tests  for the Protocol, based on the following 
reasons:  
 There are no validated methods for measuring sensitization from inhalation, an endpoint 
relevant for this project.  
 The concentrations of flue gas chemicals in the neighbourhood  environment are expected 
to be far below what can be considered to induce sensitization.  
 Most of the sensitization data available from reported studies and the classification of 
chemicals as respiratory allergens are based entirely upon clinical experience because of 
lack of well v alidated animal models. This classification is thus highly dependant upon 
several variables.

7 Ecotoxicity and biodegradation data  
 
7.1 Ecotoxicity data of flue gas compounds  
A hazard assessment has been done for the soil and aquatic compartments for the flue gas 
compounds selected as a test case fo r hazard assessment (see Table 5 .1). Literature data for 
potential flue gas components were searched by the following databases :  
 
 IUCLID (http://ecb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esis/index.php?PGM=dat ) 
ECOTOX  (http://cfpub.epa.gov/ecotox/ ) 
 
In addition ecological data were collected from Material Safety Data sheets (MSDS) , if available. 
Scientific literature wa s investigated by the search engine SciFinder search . A review of the 
findings is shown in Table 7.1, while a list of the data and the literature list are shown in 
Appendix I and Appendix J.  
 
We used the database IUCLID and SciFinder as a basis for the dat a search . ECOTOX were 
searched when very few or no data were oberved in IUCLID. MSDS were consulted for all 
substances .   
 
The search showed that data for direct air exposure exist for some plant species, but only for 
formaldehyde. The effects are obviousl y dependent on the time of exposure, although the 
endpoints used may differ somewhat. For aquatic tests the ecotoxicity test results were found for 
all compound groups except nitrosamines and nitramines. Most literature data were found for 
formaldehyde and  ammonia, including several trophic levels. For ammonia the toxicity differed 
significantly, and this was mainly the results of ionic form of ammonia. If present as cation 
(NH 4+) the ecotoxicity is lower than for the non -ionic form.

7.2 Biodegradability  
Biodegradation is not part of a hazard evaluation, but is one of the parameters included in risk 
assessment. The reason for that is that biodegradation is one of the process factors important for 
the fate of a compound in the environment (together with abi otic processes like hydrolysis and 
photolytic degradation). Indirectly, the biodegradation processes are also important for toxicity, 
since transformation of compounds by biodegradation (and other degradation processes) may alter 
the toxicity related to th e original mother compound.   
 
 
Biodegradation data are important as part of the fate estimation of flue gas emission compounds 
in biotic compartments  (soil, water, sediments) . Biodegradation can be grouped in a number of 
ways, including screening and simu lation tests, tests related to the different compartments . The 
screening tests are normally separated between ready and inherent biodegradability tests.  
 
The sources for evaluation of flues gas component biodegradation data included the following 
databases :  
IUCLID (http://ecb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esis/index.php?PGM=dat ) 
BIODEG database from the Syracuse Research Corporation ( http://www.syrres.com/what -we-
do/databaseforms.aspx?id=382 ) 
 
In addition data from MSDS were used, if available. The scientific literature was searched on the 
ISI Web of Science search engine  (http://apps.isiknowledge.com/ ). For the IUCLID and BIODEG 
databases the searches were conducted with CAS number for the individual chemicals, while the 
Web of Science was searched. The search  results for the individual compounds are shown in 
Table 7.2, while the references from the Web of  Science searches are placed in Appendix K.  
 
 Evaluations of the biodegradation characteristics of the flue gas compounds are individually 
described below. R esults from screening and simulated tests are shown in Table 7.3 below for the 
individual compounds. Only compounds with available data (see Table 7.2) are presented.

The searches showed that available biodegradation information was limited for most of the 
compounds, as shown in Table 7.3.  
 
For MEA a total of 23 screening tests were reported in the IUCLID or BIODEG databases, with a 
range of biodegradability from 30 -100 %). The median result of the degradation was 80% 
biodegradability, i.e. MEA may be defined as a ready biodegradable compound . Results from 
inherent biodegradability tests were not found. One simulated sewage test showed that MEA 
removal was 65 % with a retention time of 23 hours and a use of a semi -continuous aerated 
system (SCAS). No standard biodegradation studies in soil wer e reported.  
 
Ammonia will be an essential degradation product released by flue gas emissions. Contrary to the 
other flue gas components degradation of ammonia may result in unwanted consequences.  
Ammonia may be transformed to nitrite or nitrate (NO 2/NO 3) microbial nitrification, and elevated 
concentrations may result in eutrophication.  At a local scale, the deposition of nitrogen in the form 
of ammonia can result in eutrophication of sensitive ecosystems and the acidification of the soil. 
Eutrophication i s briefly described in a separate section of this report under future research 
requirem ents  (see cpt. 11 ). 
 
Aldehydes like formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are ready biodegradable by standard methods. A 
number of screening tests as described in the IUCLID an d BIODEG databases showed that 
formaldehyde is a ready biodegradable chemical. No inherent biodegradability results were 
recorded for these chemicals. Simulated sewage studies showed nearly complete removal of 
formaldehyde, but higher variability for aceta ldehyde in SCAS systems.  
 
For acetamide only two screening biodegradability tests were reported for this substance, both 
showing low biodegradability. This compound can therefore not be defined as ready 
biodegradable.  
 
Methylamine was shown in screening t ests to be ready biodegradable. Although some 
biodegradation studies showed 0 % degradability this was the result of high concentration and 
toxic effects on the microbes. No inherent or soil biodegradability tests were reported. For 
dimethylamine results f rom several screening tests indicated that this chemical was ready 
biodegradable, although median results were close to limit for ready biodegradability. Simulated 
sewage testing showed nearly complete removal of dimethylamine within a retention time of 12 0 
hours in a SCAS system, while a soil study showed 68 -84 % biodegradability of 14C-labeled 
compound after 7 days of degradation, and with a concentration -dependent degradation rate 
(increasing concentrations resulted in higher degradation rates). The IUCL ID database also 
reported a simulated sediment study (beach study) for dimethylamine with > 90 % TOC removal 
10 days after application.  
 
Screening  biodegradability tests were reported for two of the nitrosamines, N -
nitrosodimethylamine and N -nitrosodietha nolamine. Median results indicated that both were 
ready biodegradable, although results for 3 tests with N -nitrosodimethylamine ranged s from 0 -
100 % biodegradability. Lack of biodegradability was associated with high concentration and 
toxic effects on the  microbial populations. A simulated sewage test of N -nitrosodimethylamine 
showed 100 % removal during a 24 -hour incubation period with daily feeding during a 7 -week 
test period. A number of soil biodegradation experiments with 14C-labelled or non -labelled test 
substance showed degradability between 0 and 100 % for the two nitrosamines.  
   
59 
 
   
No screening data were available for the nitrosamine N -nitrosomorpholine or for the nitramines.  
 
The scientific literature included some valuable information  on biodegradat ion of flue gas +-
compounds . A study of the biodegradability of MEA  in a soil -groundwater bioreactor with 
indigenous bacteria showed MEA degradation within 20 -25 days (Mrklas et al., 2004). Another 
study indicated that MEA was successfully  biodegraded under both aerobic and anaerobic 
conditions , with a mmonium, acetate, and nitrogen gas as the dominant by -products .  Cold 
temperatures (5 ◦C) reduced the  biodegradation rates significantly compar ed to rates at room 
temperature (Ndegwa et al., 2004). Small a ldehydes are rapidly biodegraded by soil bacteria .  In a 
study with acclimated soil bacteria formaldehyde was biodegraded by 70 % within 24 hours 
(Mirdanadi et al., 2005). Formaldehyde is also biodegraded at anaerobic processes in wastewater 
systems under denitrification and methanogenic conditions (Eiroa et al ., 2007). Although no 
scientific studies were identified on the biodegradation of acetamide , this substance is a 
degradation product from biodegradation of acetonitrile and acrylonitrile , with subsequent 
generation of acetic acid and  ammonia for acetonitrile or acrylamide followed by acrylic acid and 
ammonia for  acrylonitrile  (Li et al., 2007) . Research studies on biodegradation of nitrosamines 
indicated slow biodegradability of N-nitrosodimethy lamine and other nitrosoamines in soil and 
lake water , with lag phases of nearly 30 days occurred before slow disappearance (Tate and 
Alexander, 1975) . Both N -nitrosodimethylamine and N -nitrosomorpholine were been reported 
with a half -life in anaerobic aqu ifers of > 100 days (Pattersen et al. , 2010). However, studies of 
microbial communities from groundwater systems showed that there was a potential for 
nitrosamine biodegradation (Gunnison et al. , 2000). It was reported elevated removal in 
groundwater by in cidental and active recycled water recharge (Zhou et al. , 2009). N -
nitrosodimethylaminane was effectively biodegraded (96%) in a biofilm reactor based on 
hydrogen, resulting in generation of methylamine and ammonia as degradation products (Chung 
et al. , 2008).  
 
7.3 Methods for ecotoxicity testing  
 
Ecotoxicity involves the identification of chemical hazard ous to the environment. Ecotoxicity 
studies are used to measure the effects of substances on fish, wildlife, plants and other wild 
organisms. Ecotoxicity  studies are conducted both for submission of information to regulatory 
authorities (e.g. Klif) and for studies and predictions of the impacts in specific environments.  
 
Ideally, the whole ecosystem should be considered, but for practical and scientific re asons, one is 
restricted to the analysis of the effects of subsystems (individual organisms). Ecotoxicity tests are 
widely used, because i) most of the pollutants eventually are found in water, and ii) of practical 
reasons, such as ease of testing.  
 
The o utcome of such ecotoxicity testing will be hazard evaluations, i.e. the inherent effects of 
chemicals or mixtures of chemicals, without considering the impacts related to the exposure 
concentrations.  
 
Ecotoxicity  refers to the hazards of both aquatic and terrestrial animals and plants. In general the 
ecotoxicity tests concepts include the testing of different interdependent trophic levels in the 
various environments. Typically three levels of the food chain are re presented:  
 
 First level: Primary producers – organisms obtaining their metabolism and biomass 
from inorganic sources (autotrophic organisms)    
60 
 
   
 Second level: Herbivor es – plant eaters, i.e. the organisms consumes primarily 
autotrophs  
 Third level: Carnivores – organisms preying on herbivores  
 
In addition , the o mnivores prey on both plants and animals, and may therefore be represented in 
both second and third levels.  
 
This system is better established for aquatic systems than for other environments, and aquati c 
organisms are often used as a first indication of environmental effects of chemicals. For aquatic 
organisms validated tests are described for all three levels:  
 
 Phytoplankton tests representing the first level  
 Invertebrate tests with organisms like Daph nia (freshwater) or Acartia  (seawater) , 
representing the second level  
 Fish tests representing the third level  
In addition to the ecotoxicity tests degradation and bioaccumulation tests are often included in the 
ecotoxicity -concept as part of describing the  environmental characteristics of chemicals. 
Degradability includes biological or abiotic degradation of chemicals to characterize their 
persistence in the environment. Bioaccumulation includes the accumulation or concentrations of 
chemicals in living orga nisms, which may or may not lead to toxic effects.  In aquatic systems 
bioconcentration is determined by comparing the concentrations in the organism and the water 
surrounding the organism. An important aspect of bioaccumulation is the biomagnification, in  
which chemicals increase in concentrations upward in the food chain as the result of preying 
activity.  
 
7.3.1 Ecotoxicity endpoints and methods     
The effect/endpoint, which is established before testing, is evaluated by comparing the chemically 
exposed organ isms (treated) with the untreated organisms (untreated controls). If the test is being 
performed on a chemical which is not readily solvable in water, a solvent (carrier) may be used to 
prepare stock solutions, and then a solvent control, organisms only ex posed to the solvent, have to 
be included. A positive (reference) control is also often included in the test, using a reference 
toxicant which has a known effect range on the test organism based on previous experience. It is 
used to determine the health an d sensitivity of the organisms, to compare the relative toxicities of 
substances by using the control as an internal standard, to perform inter -laboratory calibrations, 
and to evaluate the reproducibility (precision) of the test data with time. Whenever po ssible, 
chemical analysis should be performed to measure the concentrations to which the test organisms 
are being exposed. In addition, it is valuable to measure chemical residues in tissues of exposed 
organisms (body burden). Internal concentrations of ch emicals are seldom the same as the 
external concentrations, and some substances which are readily absorbed but only slowly lost or 
released can build up to very high concentrations. In addition, chemicals in the environment may 
also reach organisms through  the food chain/web, an exposure route usually not covered in 
standard toxicity tests.  
 
By far the most commonly used endpoint in aquatic ecotoxicological testing is 
mortality/immobilization. Other endpoints may be effects on birth, maturation and reprodu ction.   
61 
 
   
These endpoints may be used assessing ecological significance of chemical exposure through 
calculations of biomass loss. Other effects, which may be indirectly influence ecologically 
important parameters (secondary effects ) are for instance impairme nt of respiration, increase in 
detoxification enzymes, altered hormone metabolism (endocrine disruption), changes in 
pigmentation, behavioural changes etc. If a dose/concentration -response relationship is 
determined for a chemical, the threshold for an eff ect is often given as lethal concentrations (e.g. 
LC50), no observed effect concentration (NOEC), and lowest observed effect concentration 
(LOEC).   
 
The general experimental design requires careful control over test conditions (e.g. pH, 
temperature, disso lved oxygen concentrations, photoperiod). Aquatic test organisms are exposed 
in test chambers (e.g. glass tanks) to various concentrations of test chemical in water solutions, 
while soil and sediment organisms are exposed in soil/sediment microcosms. For a quatic tests 
there are generally three types of test systems being used for testing of chemicals. In static tests  
the chemical is added once to the system, no flow occurs , and the test medium is not changed 
during the experiment. In semi-static tests  the t est medium and test compound are periodically 
replaced, while flow-through tests  are conducted with test medium and test compound supplied at 
a constant rate and concentration to the organism. Test types can also be divided into short -term 
tests with single species, long -term tests with single species, tests with multispecies systems and 
finally tests us ing in vitro systems. Also for soil and sediment tests both static and flow -through 
test systems have been developed.  
 
Biodegradation is commonly determined as primary biodegradation  or ultimate biodegradation .  
Primary biodegradation refers to the use of  chemical analyses to determine the depletion of 
specific chemicals as the results of biological transformation, i.e. the biochemically mediated 
change. Ultimate biodegradation also includes the further degradation from organic to inorganic 
carbon, often c alled mineralisation (CO 2 evolution). Determination of ultimate biodegradation is 
normally performed by the use of respirometric analyses, in which oxygen consumption or CO 2 
evolution is determined. The source of organisms for biodegradation are microorgan isms from 
water (freshwater or seawater), soil, sediments (freshwater or marine), or domestic or industrial 
sewage. Test systems are normally static systems, but also flow -through test systems have been 
developed.  
 
Biodegradability tests are normally separated in ready biodegradability tests  and inherent 
biodegradability tests .  Ready biodegradability tests are screening tests, conducted under aerobic 
conditions, in which a high concentration of the test substance (i n the range of 2 to 100 mg/L) is 
used and biodegradation is measured by non -specific parameters like dissolved organic carbon 
(DOC), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and CO 2 production. Domestic sewage, activated 
sludge or secondary effluent is the typical source of microorganisms in the tests for ready 
biodegradability. The inoculum should not be pre-adapted to degradation of the test substance by 
previous exposure to the test substance or structurally related chemicals. A positive result in a test 
for read y biodegradability can be considered as indicative of rapid and ultimate degradation in 
most environments , including biological sewage treatment plants (STPs). A chemical attaining the 
pass level in these tests at a certain rate after termination of the la g phase may be classified as 
“read y biodegradable”. The pass level depends on the analytical parameter measured. Inherent 
biodegradability tests are a erobic tests that possess a high capacity for degradation to take place, 
and in which biodegradation rate or extent is measured. The test procedures allow prolonged 
exposure of the test substance to microorganisms and a low ratio of test substance to biomass, 
which offers a better chance to obtain a positive result compared to tests for ready 
biodegradability.  Some of these tests may be conducted using microorganisms that have 
previously been exposed to the test substance, which frequently results in adaptation leading to a   
62 
 
   
significant increase of the degradation rate (OECD Guideline for Testing of Chemicals  - Revised 
Introduction to the OECD Guidelines for Testing of Chemicals, Section 3, 2006).  
 
Bioaccumulation tests are performed to determine the distribution of a chemical between 
biological tissue (or a phase representing this) and the surrounding environmen t (e.g. water). The 
simplest way of describing bioaccumulation is to determine the distribution of a chemical between 
two immiscible phases , like octanol and water , to determine the potential for accumulation in fatty 
tissues. In these tests the octanol -water coefficients are determined (Pow). These tests are 
conducted either by determination of the ratio between octanol and water in a shake -flask method 
(e.g. OECD 107), or by determination of the retention time by high -performance liquid 
chromatography (HP LC), where the stationary phase represent the octanol and the mobile phase 
the water phases (OECD 117). However, more elaborate studies include the bioaccumulation or 
bioconcentration of a chemical in a specific organism, which include accumulation and exc retion 
mechanisms. In these tests the bioconcentration (BCF) is determined as the ratios between 
concentrations of a chemical in animal tissues and in the medium outside the organisms.  
 
7.3.2 Summary of methods  
 
Validated test methods are described in a number of databases. Some of the most common of 
these are:  
 
 OECD Guidelines for Testing of Chemicals  
 International Organisation for Standardisation  
 American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)  
 United States Environmental Pollution Agency (US -EPA)  
7.3.2.1  Ecotoxicity  methods  
Standard toxicity tests are in general aimed at establishing the relationship between a 
dose/concentration of a chemical and a response (endpoint). In aquatic ecotoxicological testing 
the test substance is administered with water (saltwater or fre shwater) or sediment, and 
concentration -dependent effects are then determined. Most tests are developed for testing the 
impact of chemicals in the water column (freshwater or saltwater), but a few are also for aquatic 
sediment test (OECD Tests No. 218, 219  and 225, ASTM Tests No. E1706 -05e1, E1367 -
03(2008), E1611 -00(2007) and E2591 -07, US -EPA Tests No. 8501735, 8501740, 8501790, 
8501800, and ISO Tests No. ISO 16712:2005, ISO 10872:2010). Testing of the effects of 
chemicals in sediments is mostly used for ch emicals with low water solubility. A few tests also 
employ activated sludge to assess the impact of a chemical on microbial/bacterial processes (US -
EPA – 8506800, ISO 9509:2006).  
 
Full guidelines for ecotoxicity tests may be found at these websites:

US EPA: http://www.epa.gov/ocspp/pubs/frs/home/guidelin.htm

The standard tests describe tests regimes and protocols using specific organisms for assessing 
their sensitivi ty to chemicals. Other describes tests which may be used for different species from   
63 
 
   
both freshwater and saltwater. A wide range of species may be tested, and the most commonly 
used freshwater ecotoxicity tests used are with microalgae ( Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata ), 
daphnids ( Daphnia  sp, Crustacea) and fish (Zebrafish - Danio rerio ). Test guidelines for these 
species are available from different suppliers with identical or similar protocols, e.g. the acute 
toxicity testing of Daphnia  sp (OECD - Test No. 202, US -EPA – 8501010 and ISO 6341:1996). 
There are also standard ecotoxicity tests for bacteria  and other microorgan isms, plants, 
macroalgae, rotif ers, nematodes, insects, oligochaetes, crustaceans and amphibians. Thereby 
organisms at different trophic le vels are represented. Table 7.4 shows the different available test 
guidelines from OECD, ISO, ASTM and US -EPA sorted on organism group. Different 
developmental stages are also represented for some of the organisms to determine toxicity to the 
most sensitive developmental stage (e.g. egg, larval stages) , or to assess the impact of a chemical 
on the development per se . The US -EPA have developed tests using microcosms, where several 
species are used together to simulate the effects of chemicals on a mo del ecosystem (US -EPA – 
8501900 and US -EPA - 8501925). Because different species will have different threshold for 
chemical toxicity, several tests may be used. The standard test species may not be resident in the 
area where chemical discharges are expecte d, and testing toxicity of chemicals on local species 
may therefore sometimes be preferable.  
 
Test evaluations of ecotoxicity methods for various compartments are presented in Appendix E.  
 
Chemicals may differ in their terms of type of effects they cause to a biological system. The most 
ecologically relevant endpoint is mortality, and it is also the most commonly used endpoint in 
standard ecotoxicity testing. However, some chemicals may have  specific effects on biological 
systems which are not reflected in such tests. Acute toxicity tests only reveal the concentration of 
chemical exposure to which 50 % of a test population dies (LC 50) after a limited time of exposure 
(usually 96 hrs), and alt hough this is a relatively easy and cost -effective endpoint to measure, it 
does not give direct information regarding other effects which may be of importance reflecting 
organism health, and they do also not cover potential long -term effects or effects of chronic 
exposure. Chemicals may display negative effects on respiration, ventilation, hormone systems, 
neurological systems, offspring, growth, maturation, immune system and more. These different 
“modes of toxicity” are actually poorly understood for most chemicals, and as far as standard 
ecotoxicity testing is concerned, limited information to these effects can be provided. The most 
commonly used endpoints assessed in the standard toxicity tests are acute toxicity 
(mortality/immobilization), impairment of growth and reproductive effects.   
 
Some test guidelines have also been proposed for assessing chemicals in terms of their ability to 
cause alterations in an organisms’ hormone/endocrine system, so -called endocrine disrupting 
chemicals (EDCs). One EDC test has been validated and accepted and accepted as OECD test 
(OECD – Test No. 230), while five tests have been proposed and are currently under review. One 
of these is for testing (anti)androgenic activity of chemicals in sticklebacks ( Gasterosteus 
aculeatus ), while the other s are used to assess other effects on endocrinology in fathead minnow 
(Pimephales promelas ), the Japanese medaka ( Oryzias latipes ) and the zebrafish ( Danio rerio ). 
The accepted test is a 21 -day fish assay involving screening for estrogeni c and androgenic effects 
and aromatase activity in fathead minnow ( Pimephales promelas ), the Japanese medaka ( Oryzias

7.3.2.2  Biodegradability tests  
Standard biodegradability tests are normally used to predict the fate of chemicals in biotic 
systems. Regulatory these tests are important to avoid discharges of persistent chemicals in the 
environment. Chemicals defined as ready biodegradable are expected  to be rapidly removed from 
aerobic systems by bacterial metabolism.  
 
Guidelines for validated biodegradability testing can be found on the same websites as the 
ecotoxicity tests shown above:  
 
OECD: http://www.oecd.org/department/0,3355,en_2649_34377_1_1_1_1_1,00.html

US EPA: http://www.epa.gov/ocspp/pubs/frs/home/guidelin.htm

ISO: http://www.iso.org/  
 
A summary of the available methods for standardised biodegradability tests are shown in Table 
7.5. In this table t he test methods from the different sources are compared, and several similar test 
methods are available from different sources. A similar comparison between OECD and ISO 
guidelines has is presented been by ISO (ISO/TR 15462).  
 
A test protocol evaluation of  the OECD tests recommended for the protocol are shown in 
Appendix F  
 
In Table 7.5 the methods have been separated in various test systems. It is important to 
differentiate the tests, since the various systems have different aims. The separation has been 
made with respect to what kind of biodegradability (ready, inherent or simulation) and 
compartment (surface freshwater, sediment, soil, or seawater). All ready biodegradability tests are 
normally conducted under aerobic conditions, while simulated tests oft en include both aerobic and 
anaerobic systems. In addition, specific tests have been designed for measurements of 
biodegradation under strictly anoxic conditions, as gas evolution tests (production of CO 2, CH 4 or 
H2S).  
 
Ready biodegradability tests:  
Ready  biodegradability is determined based on pass levels reached during a 10 -day window, 
normally within a 28 -day test period. The 10 -day window begins after biodegradation has reached 
10 % removal as measured by dissolved organic carbon (DOC), theoretical oxy gen demand 
(ThOD) or theoretical CO 2 evolution (ThCO 2). Within the test period the pass level should reach 
60 % ThOD/ThCO 2 or 70 % DOC removal ( OECD Guideline for Testing of Chemicals  -  Revised 
Introduction to the OECD Guidelines for Testing of Chemicals,  Section 3, 2006).  These pass 
levels represent practically complete ultimate biodegradation of the test substance as the 
remaining fraction of 30 -40 % of the chemicals then are assumed to be assimilated by the biomass 
as products for biosynthesis.  
 
Typica l measurement principles in ultimate ready biodegradability tests are decrease in DOC 
(OECD 301A, ISO 7827, ASTM E1279, EPA 835.3170), CO 2 measurements by respirometr ic 
analyses ( OECD 301B), ISO 9439, EPA835.3140) or by determination of inorganic carbon 
(OECD 310, ISO14593), biological oxygen demand (BOD) in closed systems (OECD 301D, ISO 
10707), or changes in gas pressure by manometry (OECD391F, ISO9408). Most of these tests are 
all commonly used for determination of ready biodegradability.  
 
Most ready bio degradation tests are described for typical fresh water conditions with microbial 
sources from activated sludge, sewage or surface water. Marine tests have also been described 
(OECD 306, ISO, 16221, EPA835.3169) as a variant of the closed bottle tests, and  with seawater 
as source for bacteria.   
 
Inherent biodegradability tests:    
Inherent biodegradability has been designed to evaluate if potentials for biodegradation of a 
chemical exist under aerobic conditions. Inherent biodegradability may be measured as  primary 
biodegradation by specific analyses for the test chemical or as ultimate biodegradation by DOC or 
respirometric analyses. Biodegradation above 20 % may be regard ed as proof of inherent primary  
biodegradability, while biodegradability above 70 % is  regarded as proof of inherent ultimate 
biodegradability ( OECD Guideline for Testing of Chemicals  - Revised Introduction to the OECD 
Guidelines for Testing of Chemicals, Section 3, 2006). Positive inherent biodegradability 
indicate s that  a chemical has potentials for biodegradability under favourable  conditions (e.g. i a   
66 
 
   
well-working sewage treatment plant), while negative inherent biodegradability indicates 
persistence in nature. Further testing of such persistent chemicals can be perfor med in simulation 
tests by realistically low concentrations of chemicals.  
 
Inherent biodegradability tests are usually performed by bacteria l inocula from activated sludge, 
and with determination of DOC or COD. Test periods may be 28 days or up to several months.  
 
The test methods principles include semi -continuous aeration system (SCAS)  (OECD302A, 
ISO9887, ASTME1625, EPA835.3210/5045), Zahn -Wellen/EMPA test with aerated vessels and 
rather high concentrations of chemicals (OECD302B, ISO9888, EPA835.3200), a modified MITI 
system with automated closed BOD measurements (OECD 302C). In addition inherent 
biodegradability tests have been developed for soil systems (OECD304, EPA835.3300).

Simulation tests:  
Simulation tests have been developed for various compartments, including sewage treatment 
plants (STP), soil, sediments and water. No specific pass levels have been determined for these 
simulation tests.  
 
STP tests are performed with activated sludge unit s (OECD303A), ISO 11733, EPA 
835.3249/835.32220), or biofilm units (OECD 303B, EPA835.3260).  Although no pass levels 
have been set for tests, recommendations for test substance removal of 10 -20 mg/l DOC has been 
recommended in guidelines (OECD303A, OECD30 3B).  
 
Soil tests may be performed with aerated soil (aerobic conditions) or water -logged soil (anaerobic 
conditions). In simulation tests for soil, water or sediments , low concentrations of test substance 
are recommended, i.e. low enough to ensure that bi odegradation kinetics obtained reflect what is 
expected in the environment, e.g. 1 -100 µg/L in surface water test (OECD309). Optionally, the 
use of radioactively labelled chemicals (14C-labelled) is  recommended (OECD307). Use of 
radiolabelled chemicals ena bles the determination on mineralisation by measurements of 14CO 2-
evolution.  
 
In ready and inherent biodegradability tests the test conditions like temperature are often high (20 -
25°C), and this may not be realistic conditions for biodegradability in Nordic countries. In 
addition, bacterial inocula may be higher than in relevant dis charge environments. However, the 
conditions in the simulation tests may be adapted to local conditions dependent on season (e.g. 4 -
20°C), while microbial inocula may be realistically low (e.g. 103 to 106 cells/L).  
 
Abiotic biodegradation:   
Chemicals in th e nature may also be degraded by abiotic processes as hydrolysis, oxidation and 
photolysis, and these processes may appear in combination with biological degradation. In 
aquatic, soil and sediment systems , biodegradation and hydrolysis are estimated to be more 
important processes than phototransformation, unless the chemicals are exposed directly to 
sunlight. The abiotic processes may also result in biodegradable transformation products.  
 
A standard method  for hydrolysis is described in the OECD Guideline  111, in which abiotic 
hydrolysis at three different pH -levels is determined at 50°C, while a method for 
phototransformation is described in the OECD guideline 316, with the use of a xenon lamp as 
solar simulator (wavelength 290 -800 nm) (OECD111; OECD316).   
 
7.4 Test methods relevant for ecotoxicity and biodegradation  
No validated ecotoxiciy tests have been documented for direct exposure to gas samples. All tests 
described in the various Guidelines shown in Table 7.4 have exposure routes through water phase. 
Thus, if flue gas or flue gas components are to be tested by validated ecotoxicity methods the gas 
phase compounds should be transferred to a liquid phase. Aquatic toxicity methods may therefore 
be recommended for testing.  
 
Ecotoxicity tests represent diffe rent uptake and toxicity mechanisms. It is generally recommended 
to include at least three different trophic levels, using aquatic species, These are recommendations 
both included in the REACH Directive for environmental testing of new chemicals, and in th e 
Harmonized Offshore Notification Format (HOCNF) for offshore chemicals. Both systems 
include mandatory testing with three trophic levels of species –  
 
 Autotrophic species (phytoplankton)    
69 
 
   
 Herbivore species (“plankton” -eaters)  
 Fish species  
The REACH Direc tive recommends the use of acute tests with freshwater tests, while HOCNF 
recommends marine species.  
 
7.4.1 Relevant ecotoxicity methods  
 
Based on the assumptions that validated tests from three trophic levels should be included, we 
recommend to use three acute aquatic tests as a first step in testing of flue gas compounds. Since 
CO 2 capture plants are onshore facilities we recommend the following validated aquatic tests:  
 
 OECD 201 Freshwater Algae and Cyanobacteria, Growth Inhibition Test  
 OECD 202 Daphnia  sp., Acute Immobilisation Test  
 OECD 203 Fish, Acute Toxicity Test  
Emissions to air are considered important since the emissions can be dispersed over long 
distances. At present, there are no standard ecotoxicity  tests describing air toxicity directly, but 
because of the high water solubility of the amines, it is reasonable to believe that the effect of air 
emissions will mainly be transferred to water and terrestrial environment; hence, the following 
Guidelines c ould then be considered:  
 
 Earthworm  
a. OECD 207/222: Earthworm acute/reproduction test  
 
 Insects  
a. OECD 226: Predatory mite reproduction in soil  
b. OECD 213/214: Honeybees: oral toxicity/contact toxicity  
 
 Birds  
a. OECD 205/206: Avian Tests: dietary toxicity/reproduc tion. 
 Plants  
a. OECD 208: Terrestrial plant test  
b. OECD 221: Lemna growth inhibition;  
c. OECD 227: Vegetative vigour test  
 
We regard the soil test (earthworm) and a plant test more relevant than tests for insects and birds, 
except for specific research projects. The exposure to insects and bird may differ significantly due 
to the mobility of these organisms.    
 
Three different levels of relevance should be considered; i) relevant test organism, ii) relevant 
exposure routes and iii) relevant end points. The releva nce of the organisms used in standard 
aquatic toxicity tests (e.g. OECD TG 201, 202, 203, 204, 210, 211, 212, 215, and 221)  is poor for 
the Norwegian environment. Several of t he species most widely used in acute tests ( e.g. the 
phytoplankton Pseudokirchner iella subcapitata/ Desmodesmus subspicatus , the grazer Daphnia   
70 
 
   
magna  and the fish Danio rerio , Pimephales promelas , Cyprinus carpio ) are not native to 
Norwegian environment s. Finally, since the mixture s in the flue gas from are expected to be 
complex, and g iven the fact that little information is generally available for most of these with 
respect to modes of toxicity , it is difficult to predict which effects they will have on a test 
organism.  
 
Since all methods described above are acute tests, we may a lso i nclude chronic tests, with  
exposure over more than one generation. Typical chronic methods include the effects on 
reproduction, and a number of reproduction inhibition methods are described in the OECD 
Guideline:  
 
 OECD 207 Avian Reproduction Test  
 OECD 211 Daphnia magna  Reproduction Test  
 OECD 220 Enchytraeid Reproduction Test (soil)  
 OECD 222 Earthworm Reproduction Test  
 OECD 229 Fish Short Term Reproduction Assay   
 
7.4.2 Relevant biodegradation methods  
Biodegradation will only be relevant for water and soil compartments. No biological degradation 
is expected to appear in the atmosphere compartment.  
 
OECD recommends the performance of biodegradability tests preferably by simulation tests 
(OECD, 2006). Ho wever, we realize the lack of realism in testing a significant number of flue gas 
components by complex simulation tests. We therefore only recommend testing of simulation 
tests for substances which are described as toxic (see cpt. 7.4.3) and are persisten t by screening 
tests. The most convenient screening biodegradability methods are ready biodegradability 
methods:  
 
 OECD 301A DOC Die -Away Test  
 OECD 301B CO 2 Evolution Test  
 OECD 301C Modified MITI Test (I)  
 OECD 301D Closed Bottle Test  
 OECD 301E Modified OEC D Screening Test  
 OECD 301F Manometric Respirometry Test  
If substance is ready biodegradable (biodegradability > 60 % for oxygen consumption or CO 2 
evolution or >  70 % for DOC removal) there should be no needs for further testing. If not ready 
biodegradable we suggest to investigate the potential for inherent biodegradability by one of the 
following methods:  
 
 OECD 302A Inherent Biodegradability: Modified SCAS Test    
71 
 
   
 OECD 302B Inherent Biodegradability: Zahn -Wellens/EMPA Test  
 OECD 302C Inherent Biodegradability: Modified MITI Test (II)  
Based on the inherent biodegradability test the substance may be defined as inherent primary 
biodegradable (>  20 % biodegradable) or inherent ultimate biodegradable (> 70 % biodegradable).  
 
We also recommend the performance of an abiotic degradation test for substances not ready 
biodegradable:  
 
 OECD 111 Hydrolysis  
If substances are not ready or inherent biodegra dable and considered ecotoxic (cpt. 7.4.1) we 
suggest to perform a simulation test. Validated simulation tests are described for sewage, water, 
sediment and soil compartments. We expect the soil compartment as the most relevant receiver of 
persistent flue gas substances, and the following simulation test is therefore recommended:

A) Persistence is determined by biodegradability testing. It is assumed that no potentially bioaccumulative substances 
are present in flue gas  
 
Threshold levels for defining substances as t oxic to the environment may be considered by expert 
judgment  or by established ecotoxicity threshold levels . In the OSPAR ecotoxicity threshold is 
defined as EC50 or LC50 ≤ 10 mg/L. Threshold level could also be related to expected emissions 
(e.g. as a sug gested PEC/PNEC value).  
 
If further tests are recommended we suggest that the choice(s) should be made from expert 
judgment, including discussions o n possible physical -chemical cha racteristics relevant for the fate 
in biotic environments (e.g. volatility,  bioaccumulation potential, soil adsorption characteristics) 
and probable concentrations in the flue gas emission (see cpt. 5.4).     
 
Recommended degradation methods will combine biodegradation processes with (aerobic) and 
without (anaerobic) oxygen.

judgement should include discussion of the possible fate in biotic environments and probable 
concent rations in the flue gas emission (see cpt. 5.4).  
 
7.5 Recommendations for Call Off 2 
Since a single -compound evaluation is recommended for ecotoxicity evaluation the main 
objective for call off 2 recommendations will be to achieve missing ecotoxicity  data for relevant 
flue gas compounds. However, flue gas compounds and degradation products will not be known 
until CCM technology is chosen.  
  
In that respect we may prepare preliminary recommendations for the chemicals selected as test 
case. Table 7.8 shows the type of ecotoxicity and biodegradation data lacking for hazard 
evaluations of the selected test case compounds in order to dete rmine PNEC. Several of the 
chemicals lacking essential environmental  data are pre -registered in REACH with a regi stratio n 
date of 30.11.2010. However, we do not know if all gaps will be filled by this date, or if all data 
will be publically available.   
 
However, for some of the compounds relevant data will be available from other TQP Amine 
projects. For instance, acute dat a for nitr amines will be available from the TQPAmine 5 project.  
 
Regarding the requirements for establishment or development of new methods we do recommend 
this for Call Off 2, due to a) only validated methods have been recommended for ecotoxicity  and 
biodegradability, and b) the short time period covered by Call Off 2.

8 Hazard and r isk assessment for heal th and environmental exposure  
 
8.1 Definitions  
 
The term “Risk” has been defined by OECD and by REACH (e.g. 
http://guidance.echa.europa.eu/docs/guidance_document/information_requirements_en.htm ). Risk 
is used in everyday language as "the chance of damage / disaster". When used in the process of 
risk assessment it has specific definitions, the most commonly accep ted being "The combination 
of the probability, or frequency, of occurrence of a defined hazard and the magnitude of the 
consequences of the occurrence" (EEA, 1998). Therefore, risk can be characterized as the 
likelihood of harm.  
If all other factors are e qual, especially the exposures and the organisms subject to them, then the 
risk is proportional to the hazard. However, all other factors are rarely equal. Today risk -based 
assessment approaches are preferred prior to hazard -based approaches. This is partl y due to the 
recognition that for many environmental issues a level of zero risk is not obtainable or not 
necessary for human and environmental protection and that a certain level of risk can be accepted.  
 
Risk is a combination of hazard and e xposure as in dicated in Figure 8 .1. This implies that there is 
no direct relation between hazard and risk; a chemical with a high potential hazard may have a 
small risk if the (probability of) exposure is very small. Accordingly a chemical with a low 
potential hazard m ay have a high risk if the exposure is high.

Pollution Directorate (Klif), which will be responsible for ac cepting discharge permits submitted 
by the pollution owner.  
 
On a European level potential health, safety and environmental (HSE) impacts of emissions are 
regulated through REACH (European Union regulation for Registration, Evaluation, 
Authorization and R estriction of CHemicals), the Oslo Paris Convention (OSPAR) and the 
European Water Frame Directive (WFD). REACH regulate s the European production and import 
of chemicals based on HSE criteria, OSPAR and GESAMP advices on the offshore use and 
discharges of chemicals and effluents, while WFD seeks to improve the quality of the European 
waterways and estuaries by reductions of potentially harmful chemicals and effluents.   
 
8.3 Exposure concentrations  
8.3.1 Risk assessment and exposure concentrations  
 
Risk assessments vary widely in scope and application. Some look at single risks in a range of 
exposure scenarios whereas others are site -specific and look at the range of risks posed by an 
installation. In broad terms risk assessments are carried out to e xamine the effects of an agent on 
humans (Health Risk Assessment) and ecosystems (Ecological Risk Assessment). Risk 
assessment is carried out to enable a risk management decision to be made. Risk management is 
the decision -making process through which choi ces can be made between a range of options 
which achieve the "required outcome", and should result in risks being reduced to an "acceptable" 
level (EEA, 1998).  
 
The aim of a risk assessment is to combine characteristics of chemical hazards with expected 
exposure scenarios. The product is to establish a guideline for safe use of the chemical. The 
guideline can be a regulation as to its safe use in products or exposure limits in food, air and 
water. Risk assessment is a combination of the likelihood of an oc currence and the severity of the 
consequences. Thus, it is based on the hazard profile of a chemical as well as a set potential 
exposure scenarios. A risk assessment is therefore connected to what is considered as critical 
effects of the chemical as well a s the intended use. For a given hazardous chemical the guideline 
will differ considerably depending on e.g. the population for which it is intended. As an example; 
we would not recommend the use of a carcinogen in children‟s toy but we accept it as an 
intermediary product in industry where the workers are properly educated and protected. In 
conclusion, the risk assessment is not a uniform exercise but rather directed to specific situations 
or populations. Therefore, knowledge of exposure concentrations is v ery important for assessing 
single or site -specific risks.  
 
8.3.2 Screening methods for exposure concentrations  
 
 If relevant data can not be provided for exposure concentrations, a screening method has been 
described in the Technical Guidance Documents (TGD), see Appendix G.  Exposure Assessment  
involves the calculation of a Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC).  In the TGD PECs 
are determined for various compartments, a) air, b) aquatic, c) sediment, d) soil, and e) 
groundwater. The calculations include  both a PEClocal for the area close to the emission source 
and a PECregional where environmental concentrations are estimated on a larger scale.  
 
For the derivation of PECs at a local and regional scale, a standardized generic environment, with 
default val ues is used as specified in the EU TGD. The characteristics of the real environment   
76 
 
   
will, obviously, vary in time and space. When more specific information is available on the 
location of the emission sources, this information can be applied in refinement of the PEC by 
deviating from the default values (see Appendix G).  
 
   
8.3.3 Scenario -based exposure concentrations  
Since the TQP Amine projects are related to emissions from CCM and the local conditions at 
Mongstad, scenario -based emissions and exposure concentr ations are likely to be predicted. The 
exposure concentrations to the population and to vegetation and fauna should therefore rely on 
conditions relevant for the Mongstad area. However, it is outside the scope of this project to 
predict any exposure condit ions.     
 
For the current project, company has not provided us with exposure concentrations; therefore we 
have performed a preliminary description of various risk assessment options. Predictions of CCM 
exposure concentrations are outside the scope of this  project, but relevant for the TQP Amine 2 
and TQP Amine 4 projects.  
 
8.4 Challenges in health and environmental hazard and risk assessment  
Health risk assessment is concerned with morbidity and mortality of individuals, while 
environmental risk assessment is concerned with effects on populations and ecosystems. 
Environmental risk assessment must take into account a high number of organisms; a ll with 
varying sensitivities to chemicals and various groups have different exposure scenarios. Because 
of the difficulty in obtaining toxicity data on all organisms in an ecosystem, the usual practice is 
to use data on selected organisms as representativ es for the whole system (EEA, 1998).  
 
There are a number of challenges involved when performing a risk assessment, i.e.:  
 Determining the effects at population and community level;  
 Selection of end -points;  
 Selection of species representative for the system;  
 
For environmental risk assessment specific challenges include:   
 The selection of field, laboratory, mesocosm and microcosm tests;  
 The incorporation of resilience and recovery factors of the ecosystem  
 
8.4.1 Health -related non-threshold approach  
 
Emissions from CCM involve chemicals arelease d to the atmosphere. The plant is part of a large 
petrochemical based industrial area situated in a rural area. The population of potential exposure 
will reflect any popula tion as to gender, age and health status. We should therefore consider 
exposure as air contamination to the general public, and any guideline should have the general 
population rather than the occupationally exposed as its “target” population.  
Some of the flue gas emission substances may precipitate and find their way through water or the 
food chain to people. Thus, exposure may go beyond direct inhalation. However, in the present 
(first attempt )  risk assessment we have addressed this as an inhalation prob lem only.  
Whenever we have had to do an “expert opinion” on matters that cannot be readily converted into 
some classification we have chosen to be very conservative and make potential errors on the safe   
77 
 
   
side. Thus, the reader should assume that any later revisions resulting from more data should 
increase rather than decrease the ambient air standard that we suggest in this chapter.  
The chemicals that have been identified as potential releases from the plant represent a variety of 
health effects:  
 Irritant to skin and airways  
 Sensitizers to skin and airways  
 Systemic toxicity after oral, percutaneous and inhalation exposure  
 Carcinogenic  
 Mutagenic  
 Reproductive effects  
 
Some of these effects can only be observed after exposure to relatively high concentrations during 
acute exposure.  
 
Exposure to the general population around an industrial facility like Mongstad is characterized as 
low-level continuous exposure and it is not expected that acute effects should be observed. We 
therefore need to focus on compounds causing effects that may occur after long -term and low 
level exposure. Such effects include carcinogenesis, mutagenesis and changes in fertility and 
reproduction and inhalation sensitization.  
The aim of risk assessment in the current project is:  
 determine the critical effect  
 determine a no effect dose for the most critical effect  
 suggest an ambient air standard  
 compare the ambient air standard with the expected flue gas concentration  
 
8.4.1.1  The critical effect  
 
This project specifies a total of 13 substances. Th e toxic effects noted after a database and 
literature search includes all endpoints presented in the introduction above. However, there are 
two chemical groups that deserve special attention:  
 nitrosamines which include both acute and serious long term effe cts. 
 nitramines where data is very sparse, but serious long term effects can be expected.  
 
We suggest that genetic effects (mutagenic and carcinogenic) and effects on reproduction are 
considered as the critical effects for the risk assessment.  
 
8.4.1.2  Risk assessment for mutagenic/carcinogenic compounds following ECHA and 
REACH  
 
8.4.1.2.1  Guidelines  
There are several Guidelines for Risk assessment (RA) of chemicals and substances. Generally, 
the recommended risk assessment techniques take into account the inherent to xicity of a substance 
as well as the type and degree of ex posure. Risk models incorporate  assumptions that will nearly 
always predict health risks , to assure that the outcome is protective of health. REACH (Annex I, 
1.0.1) defines the Derived No -Effect Lev el (DNEL), i.e. the level of exposure above which 
humans should not be exposed. In the risk characterization, the exposure of each human 
population likely or known to be exposed is compared with the appropriate DNEL. The risk to   
78 
 
   
humans is considered to be adequately controlled if the exposure levels estimated do not exceed 
the appropriate DNEL (REACH Annex I, 6.4).  
 
Whereas the former legislation on new and existing substances required a comprehensive RA and 
a risk characterization (RC) for all relevant tox icological effects, REACH requires a RC for the 
leading health effect (i.e., the toxicological effect that results in the most critical DNEL) for a 
given exposure pattern (such as duration, frequency, route of exposure and exposed human 
population) which i s associated with an exposure scenario. In case of flue gas compounds both 
mutagenicity/carcinogenicity as well as reproductive toxicity are considered as relevant endpoints.  
 
8.4.1.2.2  Derivation of the dose -descriptor  
The data for calculating dose -descriptors com e preferentially from lifetime oral or inhalation 
studies according to Annex V of Directive 67/548/EEC or other accepted guidelines (e.g. OECD 
guidelines). For a substance considered genotoxic any tumour type observed in an animal 
bioassay is taken as rele vant to humans and as starting point for a dose -descriptor determination, 
unless evidence to deviate from this approach is considered sufficiently convincing. This also 
concerns non -genotoxic carcinogens with tumor promoting mode of action.  
 
The specific dose descriptors:  
LD50:   Median lethal dose. The dose causing 50 % lethality  
LOAEL:  Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level  
NOAEL :  No Observed Adverse Effect Level ( NOAEL ) - the highest dose with no toxic 
effects  
BMD:  The Benchmark dose; BMD concept involv es fitting a mathematical model to 
dose-response data. The BMD is defined as the dose causing a predetermined 
change in response.  
BMD10:  The Benchmark -dose associated with a 10% response (for tumours upon lifetime 
exposure after correction for spontaneous  incidence, for other effects in a specified 
study)  
BMDL10:  Defined as the lower 95% confidence dose of a Benchmark -dose representing a 
10% tumor response upon lifetime exposure, i.e. the lower 95% confidence dose of 
a BMD10.  
ED10:  Effective dose 10 %; a  dose representing an increased incidence of 10 % due to a 
specific exposure (e.g., to a chemical).  
TD50:  The median toxic dose  of a drug or toxin is the dose at which toxicity occurs in 
50% of cases  
DNEL:   Derived no effect -level (DNEL)  
DMEL:  Derived M inimal -Effect Level; For non -threshold effects, the underlying 
assumption is that a no -effect -level cannot be established and  therefore expresses 
an exposure level corresponding to a low, possibly theoretical, effect , which should 
be seen as a tolerable exposure risk. 
T25:  The dose -descriptor value T25 is defined as the chronic dose rate that will give 
25% of the animals‟ tumors at a specific tissue site and is calculated from the 
tumor incidence at the selected tumorigenic using linear intrapolation or 
extrapolation (Dybing et al. 1997).  
 
In the European Guidelines the T25 dose -descriptor is in use for concentration limits of 
carcinogens, for non -threshold carcinogens and for risk characterization of chemicals in general 
(Annex I of Directive 67/548/EEC,  EC, 1998; EC Regulation 1488/94; EC, 1994; 
SCCNFP/00690/03). The BMD10 has regulatory use as its lowest confidence value BMDL10 for   
79 
 
   
the assessment of risks of  food ingredients (EFSA, 2005) and comparable dose descriptor, ED10 
(LED10), in cancer risk asse ssment practice by Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA, 
2005). RA is usually derived, if possible, from long -term animal studies but more recently in vitro 
studies and more adequate human epidemiological studies data are recommended to be used to 
deter mine the NOAEL  and DNEL. A large safety factor is then added –– to arrive at a safe level 
for humans  
 
8.4.1.2.3  The safety (assessment) factor  
 
The safety (assessment) factor (AF) is built in partly to account for the differences between 
animals and humans, and als o to allow for the variability between different populations, and 
individual variations among people, such as age, genetic background, health and how well 
nourished they are. The safety factor also account s for many uncertainty factors, such as the 
variabi lity in the experimental information and or inter and intra -species variation (including 
individual susceptibility); the nature and severity of the effect; the sensitivity of the human (sub -) 
population to which the quantitative and/or qualitative informat ion on exposure applies, etc. 
DNELs must consider populations (workers, consumers, and general population), exposure routes 
(inhalation, dermal/eye, oral) and duration of exposure.  
 
Assessment factors for interspecies differences: Interspecies differences result from variation in 
the sensitivity of species due to differences in toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics. If human data 
exists no extrapolation is needed. Where data from animal studies are the taken for RA the default 
assumption in general is that huma ns are more sensitive than experimental animals. Traditional 
default suggested for interspecies extrapolation is 10, which sometimes is subdivided in a default 
of 4 for toxicokinetic differences and a default of 2.5 for toxicodynamic differences.  
 
Assessm ent factors for intraspecies differences: Humans differ in sensitivity due to a number of 
biological factors (such as age, gender, genetic predisposition and nutritional status). The 
intraspecies variation in humans is greater than in the more homogeneous experimental animal 
population. Defaults typically suggested for the general population (representing all age groups, 
including children and elderly) are a factor of 10. A lower default factor is generally suggested for 
the worker population, because it is  more homogenous (excluding the very young, very old, not 
healthy, etc.).  
 
Assessment factors for differences in duration of exposure: The experimental NOAEL will 
decrease with increasing exposure times and more serious adverse effects may appear with 
increasing exposure times, a factor allowing for differences in the experimental exposure duration 
and the duration of exposure for the population and scenario under consideration is normally 
applied in risk assessment.  
 
Assessment factor for uncertainty in ro ute-to-route extrapolation: This AF is used in cases where 
no adequate data is available on the relevant route of exposure for the population and exposure 
scenario under consideration.    
 
There are two basic concepts for hazard and risk estimation - threshold vs non -threshold.  
 
For a non -threshold carcinogen, with adequate animal cancer data, DMEL approach is taken. This 
implies the use of endpoint -specific large assessment factor, i.e. 10 000 to ensure that the 
exposure causes a minimal risk. The s pecific dose descriptor BMDL10 is divided by that AF. 
When it is not possible to set a DMEL, a qualitative approach in the assessment has to be taken.   
80 
 
   
The „Large Assessment Factor‟ approach involves  the application of several assessment factors 
rather than  linear extrapolation of dose descriptors and uses BDML 10 (lower confidence limit of 
BMD) as preferential dose descriptor but this could be modified if necessary. The corrected dose 
descriptor is then divided by the total assessment factor 10,000 (for gen eral population) and 5000 
(for occupational exposure). The use of the BMDL10 is recommended if one wants to reflect the 
uncertainties and statistical errors in the available cancer dose -response data.  
When establishing the DNEL, the uncertainties in the a ssessment shall be taken into account (e.g., 
involving species differences, differences in sensitivity among humans, and quality of the 
database). The DNEL can be considered as an „overall‟ No -Effect -Level for a given exposure 
(route, duration, frequency),  accounting for uncertainties/variability in these data and the human 
population exposed. For workplace exposure, the occupational exposure limits (OELs) may 
already exist. Under certain circumstances OELs and/or the underlying information used for 
setting  the OELs can be used to derive DNELs.  
 
For derivation of the DNEL (or equivalent dose descriptor T25, ED10, BMD10) the leading 
health effect for a given exposure pattern (exposure route, population and duration) needs to be 
selected. For some compounds DNEL cannot be derived either because there is no available data, 
or data for one or several endpoints are missing or because of threshold effects. The threshold 
concept assumes the existence of nontoxic dose ( NOAEL ) no effect unless threshold has been 
reached. Our review shows that most of TQP Amine3 compounds are mutagens or suspected 
mutagens and carcinogens. These compounds exhibit both threshold and non -threshold mode of 
action. Since NOAEL  approach is valid only for threshold compounds, for non -thresho ld 
mutagens/carcinogens an exposure level without potential effects cannot be established. 
Generally, in case for the endpoints mutagenicity and carcinogenicity, a non -threshold mode of 
action is suggested (REACH Annex I, 1.4.1). However, due to the high u ncertainties in 
establishing safe exposure levels, for the threshold compounds, a substantially different approach 
is needed in relation to assessing risk. Although, there is considerable debate on the use of non -
threshold approach for threshold chemicals,  it is currently being used as no suitable approach is 
available. This may result in either over - or under -estimation of risk assessment for certain 
chemicals.  
 
8.4.1.3  The qualitative approach when no dose descriptor is available for an endpoint  
When no reliabl e dose descriptor can be set for an endpoint, a more qualitative approach has to be 
chosen. This may apply for acute toxicity, irritation/corrosion, sensitization, and 
mutagenicity/carcinogenicity. In this case qualitative indications of the potency of the  substance 
are used for developing exposure scenarios with risk management measures and operational 
conditions for controlling risk.  
 
Several of the potential flue gas compounds are considered or suspected mutagens and possibly 
carcinogens. If data is ava ilable on these compounds, then non -threshold approach with large 
assessment factor 10,000 will be the most appropriate approach. However, the limitation of this 
approach is that only single compounds are considered. In most cases there is no available or 
reliable data and thus it is difficult to derive appropriate dose descriptor such as DMEL or BMDL. 
In some cases we would be able to use animal TD50 data and derive BMD10 by including 
additional assessment factor 10. Thus overall assessment factor will be 100,000.  
 
8.4.2 Health -related worst case approach  
In some cases we do not have appropriate data for each compound in order to develop DNEL or 
DMEL values as described by REACH. Alternatives are then:    
81 
 
   
 Read -across from similar substances  
 Use of established stand ards, e.g. OEL  
Both these procedures have been discussed and accepted by REACH as valid for preliminary risk 
assessments (Guideline document chapter R4, section R.4.3.2.2 for grouping of substances and 
chapter R8, appendix R8 -13 for the use of OEL)  
When th ere is an urgent need to develop a preliminary risk assessment a hazard profile for a group 
of substances can be developed on the basis of worst case criteria. For a given group of chemicals 
which have the same functional group of toxicity we may combine t he data from individual 
members of that group into a hazard profile. We may then use whatever exposure standard is 
available (occupational or general public) for individual members of that group to develop an 
interim exposure standard which applies to all members of that chemical group. Applying such a 
procedure may cause some chemicals to receive a stricter regulation than needed – it is thus an 
approach where you will err on the safe side. In the present case such an approach can be applied 
to nitrosamine s and nitramines. It should be reiterated that this is part of a temporary risk 
assessment until such time that appropriate data is available.  
8.4.2.1  Nitrosamines  
As data is very limited for the nitrosamines we suggest combining the data available and giving it 
the name:  
 
Nitrosamine (NOS) where NOS means “not otherwise specified”  
 
The toxicology profile for nitrosamine (NOS) is the worst case entry for each endpoint of 
toxicology testing that we have been able to obtain.  
For the nitrosamines examined such an app roach will give the following result as shown in Table 
8.1.  
 
As indicated by the table one out of three is confirmed to have also reproductive effects. The other 
two are candidates for testing for these aspects. However, it is suggested that the genetic t oxicity 
is the prime critical effect for extended exposure.  
 
8.4.2.2  Nitramines  
As data is very limited for the nitramines we suggest combining the data available and giving it 
the name:  
 
Nitramines (NOS) where NOS means “not otherwise specified”  
 
The toxicology p rofile for nitramine (NOS) is the worst case entry for each endpoint of toxicology 
testing that we have been able to obtain.  
For the nitramines examined such an approach will give the following result (Table 8.2)

The data we have been able to find is far from satisfactory as input to a risk assessment. We 
therefore suggest that nitramines should be considered to have the same profile as nitrosamines 
until further data is provided.

8.4.2.3  Safety factor while using occupational exposure limits  
Based on the data available through the database searches included in this project we do not have 
appropriate data for nitrosamines or nitramines to assume that it could be possible to generate no -
effect dose level – and thus a DMEL. However, we do have occupational exposure limits (OEL) 
for nitrosamines of 0.001 mg/m3 (OEL obtained from RTECS with reference to Austria and 
Switzerland). As a provisional approach we suggest to use safety factor while  using OEL as a 
standard for the combined summary exposure of nitrosamines and nitramines. A safety factor 
needs to be included due to the following main issues:  
 age 
 gender  
 health status  
 medical surveillance  
 
8.4.2.3.1  Age 
OELs are developed for an adult population and do not take into account age dependent changes 
which for long term exposure is of special importance for children.  
Children have a higher uptake from both oral and airway exposure per kg body weight – it is a 
result of the higher metabolic rate per bo dy unit for children compared to adult. Through the same 
rational the elderly may have a somewhat lower uptake.  
 
The blood brain barrier continues to develop to the age of at least 16 years of age. Particularly in 
early childhood children may have a signif icant higher brain uptake of contaminants compared to 
adult. Also the toxicodynamic properties is different as the young is under development and 
permanent damage may be inflicted based on a higher sensitivity. There is no indication that the 
nitrosamines and nitramines are selectively accumulated or cause organ specific damage in 
nervous tissue  
 
Many compounds undergo metabolic changes which may increase the toxicity (metabolic 
activation) or enhance their excretion. The respective metabolism pattern of an  individual will 
reflect both the genetic basis as well as other exposure to compounds which are capable of such 
metabolic transformation. Children have a different metabolism profile towards contaminants 
compared to adults – a major reason being that they  during their lifetime have encountered a 
smaller array of chemicals. For the nitrosamines and nitramines, the overall toxicology certainly 
suggests that these compounds act through metabolites and that contaminant metabolism may play 
an important part in causing the effects.  
 
8.4.2.3.2  Gender  
Nitrosamines are reprotoxic and they may act both on the parental side as well as being fetotoxic 
and cause developmental effects. As they are mutagenic the parenteral effects might be both on 
the female and male side. Parenter al effects are often associated only with the maternal effects but 
there is ample documentation from occupational toxicology that mutagenic compounds in the 
workplace may cause reproductive effects through paternal exposure only. For the nitrosamines 
we su ggest that both adult (both genders) at reproductive age and the fetus should be considered 
as critical members of the exposed population.  
 
 
 
   
85 
 
   
8.4.2.3.3  Health status  
The work force is thought to be healthy – either the absence of illness or have a well controlled 
disease (e.g. diabetes or blood pressure problems). The general population will include a wide 
range of health status. Some of the illnesses may have characte ristics which are important for 
consideration of safe levels of exposure. Examples are exposure to irritant for people with 
permanent lung dysfunction.  Another example is exposure to compounds which require 
xenobiotic metabolism for its detoxification and  excretion – and the patient has a reduced liver or 
kidney functional capacity. The nitrosamines falls in the category of both being irritant as well as 
metabolized xenobiotics – and thus the liver/kidney status of a person may modify the toxic 
effects. Ho wever, it is unlikely that airway exposure will introduce similar problems.  
 
8.4.2.3.4  Medical surveillance  
In industry where hazardous chemicals are used there shall be a health and safety surveillance 
adjusted to the character of the activities. Similar health and  medical surveillance cannot be done 
for the general population  
 
8.4.2.3.5  Correction factor  
There are many occasions where people are exposed for complex mixtures and where data is not 
available for each component or the mixture. Sometimes this calls for temporary air quality 
guidelines based on OELs. OELs have been used to generate air quality standards for special 
situations with continuous exposure for more than 10 days, e.g.:  
 saturation diving  
 submarines  
 space stations  
Correction factors of 2 -10 have been intr oduced for a range of effects from temporary discomfort 
to carcinogenesis. These situations are occupational exposures to adult males of (extremely) good 
health.  
 
We would suggest a correction factor of 10 to include continuous life long exposure for an a dult 
healthy population. Then multiply this factor by 10 to adopt the OEL to the general population. 
Therefore the combined correction factor would be 100 , which means that the lowest OEL 
available should be divided by 100.  
 
8.5 Data for environmental hazard assessment  
8.5.1 PNEC determination  
The EU Technical Guidance Documents (TGD) recommends the determination of the ratio 
between Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) and the Predicted No -Effect 
Concentration (PNEC) for individual compounds as a method for risk assessment.  
 
The calculations of PEC can be made either by scenario -based approach for the individual 
emission sources (recommended) or be provisionally estimated by a screening method. The latter 
approach is described in Appendix G and is referred to in cpt. 8.3.2. If  PEC is higher than PNEC 
this represents a risk and efforts should be taken to reduce the risk. Essential for environmental 
risk assessment is th at hazard can be predicted by the determination of a concentration of a 
chemical which do not represent harm  to organisms in the environment . One such way of effect 
assessment is the preparation of the pr edicted no -effect concentration – PNEC .   
86 
 
   
 
The methods to derive the PNEC are described in the EU Technical Guidance Documents (TGD). 
The methods for obtaining a PNE C value are summarised below, but more extensively described 
in Appendix G.  
 
A PNEC is regarded as a concentration below which an unacceptable effect will most likely not 
occur. In principle, the PNEC is calculated by dividing the lowest short -term L(E)C5 0 or long -
term NOEC (no effect concentration) value by an appropriate assessment factor.  
 
Ideally PNEC values should be derived for all environmental compartments where a compound 
may end up. For flue gas emissions this will include air, vegetation, soil a nd groundwater (see 
Appendix G).  Often, few or no ecotoxicity data will be available for other than aquatic 
organisms. If the concentration of a substance in the aquatic environment  does not exceed its 
PNEC , this ensures an overall protection of the envir onment. Certain assumptions are made 
concerning the aquatic environment , which allow  an extrapolation to be made from single -species 
short -term toxicity data to ecosystem effects , although these assumptions may be uncertain. It is 
assumed that ecosystem sensitivity depends on the most sensitive species and, protecting 
ecosystem structure protects community function. It is generally accepted that protection of the 
most sensitive species should protect structure, and hence funct ion.  
 
When the pool of data from which to predict ecosystem effects is very limited (e.g. only short -
term toxicity data are available), assessment factors must be used. In this case, the effect 
assessment performed with assessment factors can be supported  by a statistical extrapolation 
method is the database on Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSDs) is sufficient for its application. 
If a large data set from long -term tests for different taxonomic groups is available, statistical 
extrapolation methods ma y be used to derive a PNEC. The method should be applied to all 
reliable available NOECs from chronic/long -term studies. The NOEC is defined as “the highest 
concentration tested at which the measured parameter shows no significant inhibition”. 
Ecotoxicity data for a broad range of taxonomic groups (described in the EU TGD) is required.  
 
For most substances, the pool of data from which to predict ecosystem effects is very limited as, 
typically, only short -term toxicity data are available. In these circumstan ces, it is recognised that, 
while not having a strong scientific validity, empirically derived assessment factors (AFs) must be 
used. The AFs reflect the degree of uncertainty in extrapolation from laboratory toxicity test data 
for a limited number of spec ies to the 'real' environment. A Fs applied for long -term tests are 
smaller as the uncertainty of the extrapolation from laboratory data to the natural environment is 
reduced. For this reason long -term data are preferred to short -term data. Thus, data from chronic 
tests  may be favoured instead of short -term acute tests . However, data from chronic tests are 
usually not available, or available only to a limited extent, for most compounds. The complexity 
of chronic ecotoxicity tests may also reduce the reproduc ibility of these tests. However, the 
chronic tests are more relevant for long -term ecotoxicity. We therefore regard it as important to 
include both acute and chronic tests for regulatory purposes.  
 
 AFs for deriving PNECs in the aquatic environment are sh own in Table 8.4. Specific assessment 
factors for sediment, soil and marine environments have also been addressed (Appendix G). The 
size of the AF depends on the confidence with which a PNEC value can be derived from the 
available data. This confidence inc reases if data are available on the toxicity to organisms at a 
number of trophic levels, taxonomic groups and with lifestyles representing various feeding 
strategies. Thus lower AFs can be used with larger and more relevant datasets than the base -set 
data.  Essentially, the more limited the existing data set is the higher the assessment factor.

8.5.2  PNEC determinations of flue gas compounds  
Provisional ecotoxicity data for the selected flue gas compounds are shown in cpt. 7 (Table 7.1). 
Based on these data PNECs were estimated for the compounds (Table 8.5). Only data from acute 
tests were available for the compounds, and assessment factors of 1000 (see Table 8.4) were used 
for the most sensitive trophic level. When several species were tested within the most sensitive 
trophic level, we used median values as t he for the PNEC determinations.

8.6 Recommendations for C all Off 2 
8.6.1 Potential health hazard and risk 
 
For the current project, Company did not provided us with exposure concentrations and a full risk 
assessment is not in the scope of the TQP A mine 3 projec t. We have therefore focused on 
preparations of hazard recommendation s as part of a  risk assessmen t in the current project : 
 
1. If exposure and toxicity data are available, non -threshold approach (see cpt. 8.4.1.2 ) with 
large assessment factor 10,000 will be the most appropriate approach. In that case a very 
good dataset of DNEL/ DMEL is required. For a non -threshold carcinogen, with adequate 
animal cancer data, we recommend a DMEL approach.   
2. If limited or no data are available and read across between compounds belonging to the 
same group, a worst case and OEL approach will be an acceptable approach of risk 
determination of health effects from flue gas emissions , with a reco mmen ded assessment 
factor of 100 .   
 
8.6.2 Envir onmental hazard and risk   
As shown above (Table 8 .5) data are missing for PNEC determinations for some compounds.  
Some of these data may be provided by other TPQ amine projects. For instance TQP Amine 5 will 
provide  ecotoxicity data for the nitr amines whi ch may be used for PNEC determinations.  
 
If environmental concentrations may be provided by other TQP Amine projects PEC/PNEC 
calculations for the flue gas compounds may be determined through Call Off 2.    
    
89 
 
   
 
 
9 Sampling methods for toxicity studies  
 
Results from sampling of flue gas emissions are crucial for comparison of emissions and toxicity 
data to be used in a risk assessment  approach .   
 
As mentioned in the ITT it was requested to propose methods on “ how to sample and handle 
representative extra cts of emissions to air from post combustion amine based CO 2-capture  “:  The 
proposed methods should ensure that a) representative extracts are sampled and b) that the 
extracts are still representative at start and during toxicity testing.  
  
9.1 The basis for sampling  
 
The basis for the sampling strategy is to collect flue gas removed from the absorber and use these 
samples for selected toxicity tests. This will require manual sampling combined with one or more 
methods for sample preservation before toxicity te sting.  
 
The strategy for isokinetic sampling has been described in a separate report in TQP Amine 1 
(Wittgens, 2010), and only a brief background will be given here.  
 
As stated in the ITT the sampling method should be able to collect representative emissi on 
extracts containing gaseous, liquid phases and aerosols/particulates. The complete emission 
(including entrained droplets and evaporated substances) and compound groups of interest include 
primarily amines, ammonia, aldehydes, amides, alkylamines, nitro samines and nitramines, with 
specific focus on alkylamines, nitrosamines and nitramines. Due to low concentrations of these 
compounds, large sampling volumes may be needed  for toxicity testing . 
 
9.2 Standard methods for manual sampling  
 
Methods for manual samp ling have been described in a separate report submitted in TQP Amine 1 
(Wittgens, 2010). In brief, this report describes the background for sampling from stationary 
sources, the design of a representative measurement location, and a generic design for 
meas urement site. As a background for the current project some essential issues in the TQP 
Amine  1 project, which are of importance for toxicity testing of flue gas samples, are summarised 
here, while a more extensive summary is shown in Appendix B.  
 
Flue gase s in a stack may be inhomogeneous due to stratification or swirling caused by duct 
design and geometry, as shown in Figure 9.1. Therefore, concentrations need to be measured both 
at several points across the same plane, as well as in several planes. It is also essential that the 
samples are collected isokinetically, i.e. with the same velocity as the main stream in the duct. 
This is further explained in Appendix B.

concentration, velocity and mass flow density (reference DIN EN 15259.)  
 
 
9.3 Standard methods for recovery and analyses  
 
A number of recovery methods for sampled flue gas have been described. The objective of these 
methods are to concentrate and preserve target analytes for chemical analyses. Some of these 
recovery methods are described in Table 9.1.   
 
Recovery methods for flue gas compounds include filtration, liquid absorbers, solid adsorbers and 
chemical conversion. All these recovery methods require some des tructive actions for trapping of 
target analytes. Particulate compounds and aerosols trapped on filters are subsequently destructed 
with acid for metal analyses. Filter materials and solid sorbents used for sampling organic 
components are extracted in solv ents for concentration and analyses of organic components (e.g. 
diethylether/n -hexane or other solvents). For condensation , cooling of flue gas below 20°C is 
required.  Condensates are then extracted with n -hexane. Samples are concentrated before 
analyses (e.g. ISO11338 -2:2003).  Alternatively components in flue gas samples may be 
specifically converted to target analytes which can be directly analysed to high specificity (e.g. 
VDI 3862).

Recovery methods post combustion amine based CO 2-capture compounds (see cpt.  2.2) are 
described in Table 9.2. As shown in this table the relevant recovery methods for flue gas 
compounds include the same recovery principles as described in Table 9.1. All these compound 
groups require the use of absorbents or solid adsorbents with s ubsequent solvent desorption.  
 
In general , the stability of flue gas components for analytical characterization is not well 
characterized. The information in current literature is insufficient and partly contradictive with 
respect to the thermal stability of some components (Wittgens et al., 2010).  
 
Methods for characterization and identification of target analytes in flue samples are show in 
Table 9 .1. Typical analytical methods include gravimetric analyses of dust particles, AAS, and 
ICP-methods for metal s, and GC -MS and HPLC methods for organic compounds. Analytical 
methods specific for CO 2-capture compounds are shown in Table  9.2.

9.4 Specific sampling requirements for toxicity testing  
A number of considerations  are important to be aware of with respect to toxicity testing of flue 
gas samples:  
 
 Non-destructed samples should be used. As shown in Table 9.1 and Table 9.2 all relevant 
sampling methods described as validated methods include some steps to destruct the 
samples.  However, if toxicity tests are to be performed , non-destructed samples are 
required. Therefore liquid acid absorbers and immobilizing solid adsorbers are not fit for 
this type of sampling.  
 Validated toxicity methods are almost exclusively recommended for use with water -based 
samples. T he use of condens ers provide s an option  for obtaining flue gas samples in one 
water -based sample. As long as the condensor s are used for trapping the components in a 
neutral non -destructive environment this approach may be considered for further 
development.  
 The high conte nt of ammonia in the flue gas may pose a problem. Ammonia may raise the 
pH beyond the acceptance criteria o f many toxicity tests. Methods for removing or 
reducing ammonia may therefore be of interest to develop to avoi d pH -changes which may 
influenc e on to xicity tests.   
 Several of the compounds of toxicological importance are present in flue gas in very low 
concentrations, as described from various confidential studies. This may require the need 
for sampling of large volumes of flue gas.  
 
   
93 
 
   
9.5 A concept study  for a sampling method with potential for toxicity testing  
9.5.1 Condensation  
One trapping method which is mentioned in several of the standard methods above is 
condensation . However, condensation methods described above are mainly performed at ambient 
or cooled  down temperatures. Since the boiling points of several of the volatile compounds in the 
flue gas are low they may escape the condensate trapping at conditions described in the standard 
methods.  
 
A condensation approach will result in trapping of the flue  gas compounds in a liquid phase. 
Therefore the route of administration for toxicity testing , both in vivo  and in vitro , will be liquid. 
As stated in the ITT flue gas es contain  compounds both in gaseous phase, in aerosols and on 
particles. By using a conde nsation methods all compounds will be present in one liquid phase, 
which is beneficial for toxicity testing. This will also be of importance for storage and 
transportation of samples.   
 
9.5.2 Cold trap concept study  
In order to further investigate the possibili ties for using cold trap condensation as a non -
destructive method for sampling of volatile flue gas components , initial experimental studies were 
performed in this project.   
 
A cold trap concept could theoretically be a potential common and generic princi ple for non -
destructive trapping of a broader range of water -soluble compounds in flue gas from a CO 2-plant. 
It is essential that the selected condensate temperature should be well below boiling points of all 
relevant flue gas compounds in order to trap fl ue gas compounds in representative concentrations.  
 
The most important feature with the cold trap concept is that it will eliminate the need for 
absorption solutions or solid adsorbents / desorption solutions that will interfere with toxicity 
studies. Ano ther important feature is elimination of the classic problem of sampling a gas stream 
with high water content, making the use of filter and adsorbent tubes very difficult.  
 
To verify that it was possible to trap also the amines with the highest volatility,  it was suggested 
to perform a concept study as part s of TQP Amine 3 (Activity 01 – Sampling of extracts of 
emissions to air for toxicity testing) and TQP Amine 1 (Subtask 2 – Manual sampling). The study 
“Analytical and preparative sampling of volatile ami nes in a cold trap  - Concept study” was 
performed  in agreement with Company . 
 
Due to the fact that a possible problem with co -sampling of ammonia with other component was 
identified, the question was raised whether selective sampling of ammonia with exclus ion of the 
less volatile compounds was possible with cold trap. To obtain data on this, ammonia was 
included in the study together with methylamine, ethylamine and dimethylamine, and a strategy 
for how to generate controlled and stable cold trap temperatur es (within the range of 0 to -196 ºC) 
was established.  
 
A system suitability test (SST) was performed in advance of the sampling main experiment. This 
study was made to verify equipment and control of temperatures.  
The main conclusions from the SST were:  
 
1) A 0.5 L gas washing bottle with open tube would serve as a model system  
2) Water is trapped as ice between -21 and -196 ºC   
94 
 
   
3) At -196 ºC air is trapped as liquefied O 2/N2. This shows that even the most volatile gases 
can be trapped by the cold trap  
4) Selection of  the cold trap temperature is essential  
5) It is possible to select and control trapping temperatures over several hours within the 
range of 0 to -196 ºC by use of different water/solvent baths  
 
The main experiments in the concept study “Analytical and Prepar ative Sampling of Volatile 
Amines in a Cold Trap” were conducted as follows (more details are given in Appendix B): The 
test mixture consisted of 1 mg/mL of ammonia and 10 ug/mL of each of the alkylamines 
methylamine, ethylamine and dimethylamine. Cold tra pping was performed in an empty gas 
washing bottle at -20 and -75 ºC. A midget impinger with 20 mL 0.1 N H 2SO 4 absorption solution 
was mounted behind the cold trap in the sampling train to collect the compounds not trapped in 
the condensate. The concentrat ions of amines were analyzed in the water trapped in the cold trap 
and in the absorption solution by GC -MS after derivatisation. The total amounts of amines were 
calculated in the trapped water and the absorption solution. The results are shown in Table 9.3.

The main conclusions from the main experiment are that:  
 
1)  The most volatile amines (ammonia and alkylamines)  can be trapped by the cold trap  
2)  Alkylamines are trapped more efficiently than ammonia  
3)  The trapping ratio of compounds in cold trap and backup impinger showed that the more 
volatile compounds are increased with lowered temperature.     
 
The result s and conclusions from the SST and the main experiment are satisfying compared with 
the scope of the study, and the concept study must be considered as successful. Given the fact that 
there is no existing methodology available for preparative sampling of f lue gas, the cold trap 
concept represent a promising alternative to fill this gap. Improved ammonia removal may be 
achieved with a “fine tuning” of the condensation temperature(s). In addition, ammonia may be 
removed selectively.   
 
The preservation of a f lue gas extract after sampling is crucial, due to the likely presence of 
degradation products and reaction products with unknown stability in the flue gas. The cold trap   
95 
 
   
concept offers the possibility of a very fast and easy transfer of the sample to storage at -196 ºC in 
liquid nitrogen, simply by direct transfer of the complete trap to a nitrogen tank. To our 
knowledge, storing at -196 ºC is the ultimate way of preservat ion when no chemical stabilization 
is possible.  
 
9.6  Recommendations for Call Off 2 
Non-destructed samples should be used for flue gas sampling. The concept study described above 
indicated that condensation could be a relevant strategy for such method develo pment.  However, 
such a method is not yet fully developed , and a number of questions still need to be answered:  
 
 Although a condensation cold -trap concept may be developed within a relatively  short 
period of time, it is evident that it may be difficult to  establish the complete method  within 
the time frame of Call O ff 2. If concentration steps are required, this will increase the time 
of test method development further.  
 There are no standard validated method s for toxicity testing of flue gas samples. It i s also 
clear that methods for toxicity testing of emission samples must be established and 
validated . Since this will be a time-consuming  process , we do not see that this will be 
realistic to ascertain wi thin the Call O ff 2 period . 
 The problem of high pH caused by ammonia may be partly solved by the cold trap 
approach, with selective removal of ammonia. However, we are not sure that this problem 
will be solved within the Call Off 2 period.  
Before these questions are answered  we do not regard it as possible to develop sampling methods 
and flue gas toxicity methods within the time frame of Call Off 2. 
 
However, it is essential that reliable methods for chemical analyses are available for hazard and 
risk assessment. However, these metho ds are outside the scope of this project and are handled in 
TQP Amine 1.  
 
10 Suggested approach for the Test Protocol - emission compound toxicity  
 
Based on the available tools, methods and data for emissions of flue gas compounds from CO 2 
capture plants we suggest a number of options for an emission toxicity test protocol. A draft Test 
Protocol is enclosed in Appendix A of this report.  
 
10.1 Basic principles  
 
The basic principles behind the test protocol are:  
 
1. The main part of the protocol should rely on the testing of single compounds expected to 
be part of emissions.  
2. Data from mammalian toxicity and ecotoxicity studies should be related to data from flue 
gas sampling for risk assessment    
96 
 
   
3. Health and environmental data should be collected from various information sources and 
the quality of the data evaluated , if possible  
4. Where limited data are available, or data quality is questionable, testing by validated 
methods should be performed by acknowledged laboratories, and according to accepted 
quality assur ance (QA) criteria (e.g. GLP)      
5. Health -related data and test requirements are more important for some endpoints than 
others. In that respect data related to DNA damage/carcinogenicity and reproduction 
toxicity should be ranked high, representing long -term health effects  
6. Ecotoxicity evaluations are based on standard approaches for determinations of predicted 
no-effect concentrations with aquatic test organisms . Aquatic data may be supplemented 
with data from tests for soil and plant species , if judged to necessary by expert opinion.   
7. Biodegradation evaluations are based the determination of ready biodegradability, and 
with options for inherent biodegradability and for simulation testing. Abiotic 
degradability should also be determined for biologically reca lcitrant chemicals  
8. We do not recommend testing of mixtures of chemicals at the moment since appropriate 
methods are not available at the moment. Further efforts are needed to -   
a. Establish sampling methods  
b. Establish toxicity methods to be used for emission  compound and mixture toxicity  
c. Determine if toxicity of individual compounds is additive  
d. Establish test system (s) for comparison o f the toxicity of flue gas compounds  
   
9. Full risk assessments should not be part of the Protocol until reliable dispersion an d fate 
models are available for CCM.  
10. Data from mammalian tests included for hazard assessment as part of a risk evaluation 
should be obtained from two approaches  
a. Determination of DNEL \DMEL (DMEL recommended) if sufficient data are 
available   
b. Worst case ap proach if not sufficient data are available for DNEL \DMEL 
determination  
11. Data from ecotoxicity tests included for hazard assessment should be obtained from the 
determination of a PNEC  
12.  Data from biodegradability tests may be used for determination of biodegradation rates in 
the environment, as part of the determination  of environmental concentrations  
   
97 
 
   
10.2 Protocol organisation  
 
The Protocol is currently separated into two parts:  
 
 Part 1 – Test methods  
This part describes the proposed methods and flow -sheets for performances. Only 
validated OECD methods are included as toxicit 0y and biodegradation methods. Methods 
for hazard analyses are described both for health and environmental data. Methods for flue 
gas sampling are not included in the protocol since these methods are not yet developed, or 
are the subject of the project TQP Amine 1. Methods for chemical analyses of flue gas 
compounds are not described, since these are the subject of the project TQP Amine 1.  
 
 Part 2 – Protocol for testing of single flue gas substances  
This part describes the principles for testing of substanc es determined or expected to be 
present in flue gas emission mixtures. The sources of information required for obtaining 
health and environmental information and for selection of test methods (if required) are 
described (with reference to the methods descr ibed in Part 1). Included in this part is a 
flow-sheet for the toxicity testing.  
 
Additional parts may be added to the Protocol  in the future,  if methods are developed. These may 
include:  
 
1. Protocol for full risk assessment  
2. Protocol for testing mixtures o f flue gas subs tances  
3. Protocol for testing of flue gas emission samples  
A protocol for full risk assessment should combine the data from hazard assessment included in 
the current protocol with methods for estimating exposure concentrations. For CCM  we sug gest 
that exposure concentrations should be determined from relevant emission data , in combination 
with data obtained from atmospheric dispersion studies of flue gas compound s, and from possible 
estimations of the fate of flue gas compound processes in the  atmosphere and in other 
environmental compartments. Some of these data may be provided by collaboration between 
scientific groups involved in several of the TQP Amine projects.    
 
If a future protocol for toxicity testing of mixtures of flue gas substanc es is prepared, toxicity 
methods should be simple in vitro  mammalian or ectoxicity methods . We suggest that the initial 
objective of such a testing should be to decide if toxicity of flue gas can be caused by additive 
mechanisms, or if different compounds show interactions. It is essensial that possible 
toxicological interactions between flue gas compounds are characterised in a research proje ct 
before further recommendations are included for the Protocol.  
 
A protocol for the testing of flue gas emission samples should describe the possible information 
received from the toxicity testing of flue gas emission samples by toxicity methods (mammali an 
or ecotoxicity test methods). For this purpose w e suggest to use simple in vitro  test methods. The 
data from these tests may be used for comparison of the overall toxicity of gas samples originating 
from different solvent technologies. If additive toxic  responses are proven (see above ) the results 
from such tests may be used for verification purposes, by comparison of emission sample toxicity 
and expected toxicity calculated from the data of individual substances. If sample toxicity is   
98 
 
   
significantly high er that expected from calculations this may indicate potentials for some 
“uncharacterized” compounds in the flue gas.  
 
11 Future research requirements  
 
We suggest that future requirements for studies relevant to this project should be separated in two 
major issues:  
 
a) Provide data for risk assessment  
b) Development of methods for toxicological measurements of flue gas emissions  
 
The research requirements desc ribed below are those which are not included in Call Off 2, with a 
longer  time frame than suggested for C all Off 2.  
   
11.1 Risk assessment  
Risk assessment includes both the determination of toxicity and the environmental exposure 
concentrations, and the combi nations of the two sets of parameters are essential for the 
determination of the risk to the population and the environment.  
 
In this report we have recommended the use of validated toxicity methods to be used for the 
toxicity -part of risk assessment, and only accepted OECD procedures have been included for 
health and environmental toxicity methods. However, our suggestions are based on the currently 
available OECD methods.  
 
However, as new methods are being accepted as OECD methods these should also be co nsidered 
for use for risk assessment of flue gas compounds. In Europe there is a pressure towards replacing 
animal testing by in vitro  tests. As new in vitro  tests are accepted as OECD tests some of these 
may be considered to be supplement s to animal testi ng. The use of in vitro  tests may even be used 
to reduce the numbers of in vivo  tests required. However, in vitro  tests can never replace in vivo  
tests since several important toxicological mechanisms can only be determined by animal tes ting, 
e.g. metaboli c activation . The development of alternatives to animal testing is not the topic of  the 
current project, and for risk assessment we suggest that new relevant methods may be considered 
for a flue gas toxicity protocol as soon as they become validated.   
 
Data for predictions of environmental concentrations are very important in order to predict 
exposure concentrations. Emission data for flue gas samples are available , and the methods for 
obtaining these data are the topic of TQP Amine 1. However, the post -emission processes are very 
important for the determination of exposure concentrations, and these are the topics of TQP 
Amine 2 (dispersion models) and TQP Amine 4 ( atmospheric processes). It is therefore important 
that all the information from these TQP Amine projects, and other relevant projects with 
accessible data,  are utilised in order to obtain a good risk assessment model  for CCM . 
 
11.2 Sampling and toxicity testing  of flue gas emissions  
Identifying methods for sampling and testing of flue gas emissions w as one of the main objectives 
of TQP Amine 3. The purpose of such sampling and testing would be to compare the overall 
toxicity of emissions from different solvent t echnologies, and to identify possible “unknown” 
compounds of toxicological importance. As described in the preceding parts of the report methods 
were not currently available, neither for sampling for toxicity analyses nor for performing toxicity   
99 
 
   
analyses o f flue gas samples. The reasons for this are described in other parts of this report. We 
will here describe some possible research requirements for the sampling and testing of flue gas 
emissions.  
 
11.2.1  Sampling methods  
As discussed in cpt. 9 the use of a condensate method may have potentials for toxicity testing of 
flue gas samples. By this approach samples will be trapped in one liquid phase instead of being 
distributed between gaseous, particulate and droplet phases.  Since the condensate m ethod has 
potentials for sampling of flue gas for toxicity testing , we recommend that further studies are 
conducted for developing this approach for emission toxicity studies. However, the development 
and testing of such meth ods will take more time than a Call Off 2  period.  
 
Some of the major research requirements are listed below for a condensation approach:  
 
 Characterizing condensate trapping of most relevant flue gas compounds  
 Investigate the impact of high ammonia concentrations on toxicity  
 Developing  methods for concentration of toxicologically important compounds appearing 
in low concentrations in flue gas emissions without violating  
 Characterisation of sampling method  representativeness and reliability  
 Characterisation of stability of flue gas com pounds from sampling to toxicity  
 Identification of toxicity methods relevant for testing of flue gas emission samples  
 
If ammonia becomes a problem for toxicity testing, samples may be prepared with reduced 
ammonia content. The samples will then no t be representative for flue gas. Also, if low 
concentrations of some compounds require concentration of these, distribution between 
compounds may be changed when compared to the original samples due to selective 
concentrations. As mentioned above, improved ammon ia removal may be achieved by a “fine 
tuning” of the condensation temperatures. In addition, methods for selective removal of ammonia 
may be used. For instance, zeolite has been used for removal of ammonia from wastewater 
systems (Cooney et al., 1999).  
 
The flue gas samples may appear in low concentrations, and concentration steps may be provided. 
One way of concentrating the flue gas samples as condensate may be the ECOWAT principle. 
The ECOWAT principle is designed for water purification and describes re moval of contaminants 
from the water. Pure water is crystallised as hydrate, while contaminants are not crystallised 
(www.ecowat.no ). In this way the contaminants are separated from pure water and concentrated. 
Thus, this  principle may therefore also be used for concentrations of contaminants and removal of 
clean water , to concentrate substances in a condensate, as possible required for trapped flue gas  
compounds in low concentrations .

11.2.2  Toxicity methods for flue gas samples  
11.2.2.1  Testing of complex mixtures  
Complex mixtures can be assessed through direct toxicity testing or considering summation of 
toxicity contributed from individual compounds.  
 
Toxicity testing of complex airborne mixtures is a challenge in whatever test system is employed. 
Inhalation tests using animals in an exposure chamber is difficult because gas mixtures may 
condensate and changes due to the physical conditions in the chamber. Some of these problems 
are can be avoided by using direct nose/mouth expos ure of experimental animals. Equipment s and 
techniques have recently been developed for the direct exposure of in vitro  cell cultures to 
airborne components – both particulate and volatiles. These systems may become important tools 
in developing further in vitro  approaches to toxicity testing of airborne contaminants. The sample 
preparation will be virtually the same as for standard animal inhalation procedures. These 
techniques are potentially helpful for comparing relative toxicities of similar compounds or 
mixtures.  
 
An alternative to toxicity testing of the complex mixture itself is to address the knowledge we 
have on individual components of the mixture. A variety of summation formulas have been 
developed based on toxicokinetics and –dynamics. Some of t he models can be very helpful for up 
to 3-5 compounds with similar toxic effects. However, they are less helpful when there are many 
components that differ in their toxicity endpoint. In such cases regulatory bodies have often opted 
for a worst -case approa ch giving the mixture a rating/classification based on severity of effect 
although it is caused by a minor component.  
 
A future evaluation of complex airborne mixtures like flue gas should include comparing several 
approaches:  
 Testing of individual compounds followed by theoretical considerations  
 Testing of  real mixtures  
 Testing of  synthetic mixtures  
 
We recommend the development of such an approach, and this will need the support of industry 
as well as public research funds. However, this will go far beyond the short -term scope of the 
present study.  
11.2.2.2  Toxicity methods  
Due to the complexity of flue gas mixtures we suggest that simple in vitro  tests should be 
preferred for these types of studies. We therefore suggest that different in vitro  tests for several 
toxicity endpoints are consid ered for these types of studies.  Several in vitro  tests have been 
described above, and in addition to these some other methods may also be considered, as 
described below:  
 
Cytotoxicity –  
 
 Clonogenic assay (plating effi ciency, colony forming ability ), validated scientifically  
 Proliferation (growth activity) assay or simple version relative growth (in ECVAM 
validation together with genotoxicity in vitro ) 
 In vitro  cytotoxicity  as starting point for determination of LC50, NRU 3T3 or NHK 3T3 
(OECD draft 129)    
101 
 
   
Mutagenicity/genotoxicity  
 In vitro  comet assay both for detection of strand breaks (under ECVAM/JaCVAM 
validation) or for detection of oxidized DNA lesions (photogeonotxicity  assay)  
 In vivo  comet assay (JaCVAM/ECVAM validation) is useful to detect DNA damage in 
different organs and  is already used for in vivo combined endpoints study   
 In vitro  Cell Transformation Assays; either  1.Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) assay 
2.Balb/c a ssay 3.C3H/10T1/2 assay (EU method B.21)  
Reproduction toxicity  
 The Stably Transfected Human Estrogen Receptor -alpha Transcriptional Activation Assay 
for Detection of Estrogenic Agonist -Activity of Chemicals  (OECD 4 55) 
Ecotoxicity tests  
 Determination of the inhibitory effect of water samples on the light emission of Vibrio 
fischeri (Luminescent bacteria test) (ISO 11348).  
 
For chemicals with unknown modes of toxic action, the recent and projected advances in 
toxicogenomics, bioinformatics, systems biology and computational toxicology represent a 
paradigm shift for toxicity testing of chemicals. High -throughput screening tools, like the use of 
microarrays and metabolic profiling of molecular effects caused by chemicals with un known (and 
known) modes of toxicity, are expected to revolutionize predictive toxicology and elicit a 
paradigm shift in regulatory toxicity testing and risk assessment. These approaches are still in 
their infancy, however, the use of microarrays to elucida te possible modes of toxicity of and 
establish effect limit have recently been published (Poynton et al., 2008).  
 
In order to evaluate such methods it is important to investigate a number of essential factors with 
respect to flue gas samples:  
 Detection li mits with respect to compound concentrations in flue gas samples : Several 
compounds of toxicological importance appear in low concentrations in the samples  
 Sensitivity to samples with different compound composition : It is essential that toxicity 
methods a re able to separate between samples with different compositions  
 Ammonia toxicity : Since ammonia may be a significant contributor to toxicity even after 
efforts to reduce concentrations it is important to identify the impact of toxicity (and other 
effects c aused by ammonia) on the test methods   
 Interactions between different compounds : If toxicity proves to be additive in an in vitro   
method , this method will be of interest for detecting unknown compounds by comparison 
between flue gas samples and synthetic  flue gas mixtures     
102 
 
   
 
 
11.2.3  Experimental systems for in vitro  toxicity testing of gas samples  
For direct toxicity testing of flue gas samples some exposure systems have been suggested.  
 
A direct exposure system at air/liquid interface  was developed in vitro  toxicity studies, using 
gaseous exposure of human lung cells (Ritter et al.,  2001; Pariselli et al. , 2009). A 
commercialised version of the exposure system is shown in Figure 11.1. In this system gaseous 
samples are exposed to cell cultures on membranes w ith underlying culture medium wetting the 
membranes.  
 
Komori and co -workers described a simple gas exposure system for volatile chemicals or gas 
flow-through based on the Microtox principle, using luminescent bacteria immobilised to a 
membrane, as shown i n Figure 11.2 (Komori et al. , 2009).  
 
Thus, testing of various in vitro  methods for toxicity measurements of  flue gas will be relevant for  
comparison of samples from various sources, e.g.  different solvent technologies.

on a solid matrix (from Komori et al. , 2009).  
  
11.3 Degradability  
Determinati on of the d egradation of flue gas compounds after emission to the environment is 
important for the determination of the fate of the emission compounds. Methods for 
biodegradability and hydrolysis have been suggested in the Protocol. However, photolytic 
degradation is also of importan ce, especially for the prediction of the fate of nitrosamines and 
nitramines  (Bråthen et al ., 2008 ). An OECD Guideline for phototransformation in water 
(OECD316) exists, but no validated methods for phototransformation in air.  We suggest that 
photodegradation methods are investigated  and considered to be included in a future revision of 
the Protocol.   
 
11.4 Eutrophication  
Eutrophication  is a process that results in a concentration of nutrient content to an extent that 
increases the p rimary production. Due to considerable expected emissions of ammonia from CCM 
eutrophication may become an environmental topic.  
 
After release to the environment ammonia may be oxidized to nitrite and nitrate by aerobic 
nitrification processes. These nitr ogen compounds are well known as fertilizers and may add to 
the local nitrogen budgets. Eutrophication may impact sensitive ecosystems and attribute to soil 
acidification.  
 
It has also been suggested that soil fertilisation may lead to nitrosamine generat ion in the soil 
(Barabasz et al., 2002).  
 
Due to expected emissions of ammonia from CCM we regard it as essential to investigate the 
possible impacts of ammonia and nitrification eutrophication around Mongstad. This may be 
performed as  experimental studies , but preferably as monitoring campaigns. Biomonitoring of 
eutrophication has been suggested by using species  sensitive to nitrogen input to the environment . 
  
104 
 
   
For instance have lichens been suggested as possible indicators of nitrogen emissions (e.g. Frati et 
al., 2007; Jovan et al.,  2006).  
 
12 Conclusions  
 
Based on the recommendations in this report the following conclusions are made:  
 
Emission compounds for toxicity testing:  A single compound strategy should be used for risk 
assessment of flue gas components, including solvents and degradation products. Toxicity testing 
of flue gas emissions is currently not recommended. The composition of flue gas will change from 
emission t o exposure due to post -emission processes  and f lue g as samples may change over time. 
Biological behaviour may be affected by the interactions between emission substances . The 
predominant components ammonia may affect physiology of test animals , as well as affecting 
uptake mechanisms of other substances. Single compound approaches are well established for risk 
assessment of complex mixtures from other environments (e.g. for risk assessment of regular oil 
emissions). We suggest that all compounds detected in flue gas emissions should be considered 
for toxicity evaluation , but testing importance ranked according to expected toxicity and 
emissions .  
 
Hazard and risk assessment: A number of 13 compounds representing different flue gas emission 
groups were selected as a case study for hazard assessment for provisional risk evaluation. Health 
and environmental effects of these were surveyed in different databases. Health effects inc luded 
important endpoints like mutagenicity/genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproduction toxicity and 
sensitization. Hazard classification was made according to the GESAMP system. For 
environmental tests various databases were investigated to identify ecoto xicity (acute or chronic) 
to species representing different trophic levels, while biodegradability was investigated to define 
the substances as ready or inherent biodegradable. The hazard assessment system is described in 
the Protocol prepared from the pro ject.Toxicity methods for hazard assessment recommended in 
this project include DNEL/DMEL approach (DMEL preferred) for mammalian toxicity if enough 
data are provided to determine reliable no -effect or minimal -effect levels. If not sufficient data are 
available it is recommended to use a worst case approach, based on Scandinavian OEL 
concentrations. We have not performed any quality assessment of the toxicity data which is used 
for the basis of OEL. For some of the degradation products no OEL values are ava ilable, to our 
knowledge. Ecotoxicity data are to be used for determination of PNEC values, based on the most 
sensitive test organism . It is recommended to use data from chronic tests rather than from acute 
tests, if available . For a full risk assessment toxicity data are relatd to exposure concentrations, 
obtained from emission data , in combination with estimations based on post -emission process.  
 
Toxicity testing:  Toxicity and degradation testing of case study flue gas substances are 
recommended for a fu ll hazard assessment. Only validated OECD test guidelines are 
recommended for testing. Tier -based test systems are recommended both for  
mutagenicity/genotoxicity/carcinogenicity, reproduction toxicity, ecotoxicity and biodegradation 
testing. The test meth ods are describe d in the Protocol prepared for the project.  
 
Sampling of flue gas emissions :  A sampling method based on cold trap condensation seems 
promising for toxicity testing. However, only a system suitability test has so far been performed, 
and a method is not developed yet for sampling of flue gas for toxicity testing. Therefore, we do 
not recommend any flue gas toxicity test establishment for Call Off 2, but as part of future 
research requirements.  Further development is expected as part of the T QP Amine 1 project.  
    
105 
 
   
 
Recommendations for Call Off 2: In a Call Off 2 of the ITT a  number of actions are to be 
performed with a short peri od of time as a result of recommendations made in Call Off 1. The 
period of time for Call Off 2 has been suggested by Company to last for app roximately 6 months . 
We suggest here that t hese actions should include testing for toxicity and degradability  of 
substances used for hazard assessment in this project. Some of the recommended mammalian tests 
will require longer te st periods than 6 months.  
 
Future research needs:  Future research needs have been identified  in this project . For risk 
assessment should evaluations of new emerging validated methods be of interest, especially in 
vitro  methods which can supplement or aid in the re duction of animal testing. Exposure 
concentrations are essential for risk assessment, and these concentrations should be estimated by 
combining the outcome of several TQP Amine projects. Toxicity testing of flue gas emissions is 
an option, but app ropriate sampling method(s) should be developed. Toxicity methods for testing 
of samples should also be established when reliable sampling methods are available. It may also 
be of future interest to consider the possibilities of using simple exposure syste ms for in vitro  
testing of gas samples. The potential impacts of ammonia  emission on establishment of emission 
mixture sampling and toxicity methods should be investigated during method establishment. The 
environmental impacts of ammonia emissions from CCM  and the establishment of monitoring 
methods may also be of interest.  
 
The main objectives of all these efforts should be to characterise the risk associated with the 
different flue gas emission products and use these data for risk reduction.

Appendix A TEST PROTOCOL – EMISSION COMPOUND  TOXICITY  
  1 Test Protocol for Emission Compound Toxicity  
  
       
 
Test Protocol  
 
Emission Compound Toxicity  2 Test Protocol for Emission Compound Toxicity  
  Intentions and limitations of the Protocol  
The intention of this Protocol is to describe the decisions and methods to be used for 
evaluation and testing of the toxicity of CO 2-capture flue gas emissions.  
 The Protocol is the results of the recommendations from the project TQP Amine 3 “Emission Compound Toxicity ”. The objective of this project was to suggest methods 
for the determination of the toxicity of flue gas emissions from post combustion CO
2-
capture. The Protocol is based on current status of knowledge and methods, and future improvements on these matters may result in revisions of the Protocol.    
 The protocol is based on a “single -substance” approach, i.e. the hazard 
determination of si ngle flue gas components. Toxicity determination of flue gas or 
mixtures of flue gas compounds is currently not recommended in the Protocol, a) due to the complex interactions of many chemicals in the flue gas, b ) current lack of 
knowledge about variabilit y and reproducibility of flue gas samples, and c) lack of 
knowledge about the impact of quantitatively predominant compounds like ammonia on emission toxicity. However, methods for toxicity testing of flue gas may be considered in the future if some of the se knowledge gaps are closed, preferable 
by simple in vitro screening toxicity methods. These methods may also be considered used for the toxicity testing of mixtures of single substances to deduce possible interactions between the substances.     
 Methods  for risk assessment have not currently been included in this Protocol. An 
important part of risk assessment is the determination of the environmental concentrations of emitted compounds. This is not part of the scope of TQP Amine 3, but part of other TQP Amine Projects. Risk assessment should therefore be included as a result of the information from several TQP Amine projects.    
 In this Protocol only validated methods are recommended. In this respect, only 
methods recommended by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) have been included. Other methods, not currently validated, 
may be important supplements to OECD methods, but should be further evaluated 
before included in this Protocol.    
Sampling and analyses of flue gas are important in order to relate toxicity of compounds to concentrations in the emissions. Sampling methods are also important for possible future applications for tox icity analyses. Sampling methods 
and analyses of flue gas samples are part of TQP Amine 1 and therefore not currently included in this Protocol. Methods for sampling of flue gas for toxicity methods have not been developed yet. If reliable sampling methods  for toxicity studies of flue gas 
are developed, these methods will be considered to be included in this Protocol.  
 3 Test Protocol for Emission Compound Toxicity  
  Overview of the Protocol  
A general overview of different elements in a Protocol for flue gas emissions is 
shown in Figure 1. This figure includes both elements included in the current Protocol and additional future elements to be included.  
 Health and environmental (HE) aspects o f emissions to various environments should 
include both toxicity testing and analyses, hazard and risk assessment and actions to reduce emissions of harmful substances to the nature (Figure 1), including  descriptions of following elements:  
 1. Selections of emission substances and available HE information for these 
substances  
2. Hazard analyses from available information   
3. Toxicity testing of selected emission substances for full hazard assessment  
4. Risk analyses  
5. Identification of flue gas compounds representing  HE risk  
6. Reductions of HE risk  
 
Selection of flue gas test substances must be based on available information related to choice of solvent/solvent technology and to the predictions of degradation processes. Data from experimental studies and emission campaigns should be used for selection of test substances. For compounds of high health/environmental concern (i.e. nitrosamines and nitramines) also theoretical assumptions may be considered.  
 
Possible sources for the collection of health and environmental inf ormation will be 
described in this Protocol.  
   
Validated toxicity testing as described here will include both testing for human 
health effects by mammalian toxicity tests and for ecotoxicity tests. Biodegradation tests will also be included as part of the  ecotoxicity test system.  
 
For human health effects a number of endpoints have been selected that are of high 
concern. These include genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, effects to reproduction and sensitisation. These are effects related to the concern of the general population. 
Effects like irritation/corrosion, which are more of occupational concern, have been considered in the summary sheets for chemicals but have not been included for testing here.    Ecotoxicity effects include three trophic levels of aqua tic organisms have been 
included. In addition, acute effects to soil and plant species have been included, 
since these are relevant for flue gas emissions. A chronic test has also been included to relate effects to long -term exposure. Biodegradability test s have been suggested 
to define if the test substances are ready or inherent biodegradable, and if recalcitrant substances can be hydrolysed.  
   4 Test Protocol for Emission Compound Toxicity  
  
 Tier- based systems have been suggested for a ll toxicity test s. Tier- systems will 
reduce the number of tests to be performed.  
 Chemical analyses for flue gas samples will be described in another TQP project (TQP Amine 1), and the Protocol will refer to this project for describing analytical methods for qualitative and  quantitative characterization of flue gas samples.  
 This protocol is mainly concerned with the testing of components emitted to the environment in flue gas from post combustion CO
2-capture, and not trapped in the 
facility by flue gas cleaning. Thus, water wash sa mples are not included in this 
protocol, since these will be recycled in the system. It is expected that water wash 
will be destructed (e.g. by incineration) and should therefore not represent any risk to the environment, unless discharged acc identally. The water wash may be used 
indirectly for measurements of toxic effects of the emissions. In theory, toxicity measurements of water wash samples can be used for determination of removal of 
flue gas toxicity prior to emission, since the water was h system is pl aced in the top of 
the absorber . However, this is  difficult to calculate.  
 The Protocol is separated in two main parts describing different levels of flue gas emission toxicity testing:  
 Part1: Description of the methods used in the Protoco l 
Part 2: Toxicity testing of single flue gas test substances (TSs)   Part 1 focuses on the methods used in the Protocol, including hazard and toxicity/degradation methods. Part 2 describes the flow from selection of test substances, available information,  and the test requirements.

 OVERVIEW OF TEST METHODS  
This part describes the test methods included in this protocol. These test methods 
include methods for:  
 
A. Mammalian toxicity (health effects)  
B. Ecotoxicity (environment) 
C. Biodegradation and degradation methods (fate in the environment)  
D. Hazard method  
 Performing laboratories should run tests or studies according to approved quality assurance (QA) systems, for instance Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) or similar, or be accredited for specific methods/analyses.    
 
 HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT (HSE)  
Seve ral of the chemicals associated with flue gas emissions are of health, safety  and 
environmental concern. Nitrosamines and nitramines are potential carcinogenic chemicals. Amine compounds are in general irritating and corrosive, and some of them may have s ensitizing characteristics.  
 The chemicals must therefore be handled with strict care; all work should be done in fume cupboards. Special care should be taken when storing and handling of nitrosamines and nitramines, following the strictest precautions re commended in 
the MSDS.  
 Due to the explosive characters of nitramines specific risk analyses should be performed before handling of these chemicals.

 1A-1: Decisions of test methods for  mammalian toxicity  
 
Selection of methods for testing of mutagenicity and carcinogenicity should be made 
in a stepwise way as shown in Figures 2 to 4. The first step includes an acute test for oral exposure for determination of median lethal dose (LD50) (test for acute toxicity, 
not genotoxicity or carcinogenicity). Concentrations obtained in this test are used for setting dosages for further toxicity tests . The acute oral toxicity test is followed by i n 
vitro genotoxicity testing (Figure 2) , in vivo  genotoxicity testing (Figure 3) , and by 
carcinogenicity testing (Figure 4).   Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity:

A number of 9 validated OECD Guidelines and one draft Guideline are available for 
reproduction toxicity. Of these there are four relevant methods (OECD-  415, 416, 
421, 422) which measure the fetotoxicity in addition to reproductive and 
developmental effects:  Reproduction toxicity:  
 The OECD test method 422 , which is a combination of OECD 407 and OECD 421, 
provides information on dose concentration and measures several aspects of 
fetotoxicity. The OECD method 422 uses fewer animals (10 animals of each sex for 3 treatment groups and control) when compared to individual testing of OECD 407 (5 animals of each sex for 3 treatment groups and control) and 4 21 (10 animals of each 
sex for 3 treatment groups and control).

 Recommendations for reproduction toxicity testing should be based on a two -tier 
system (Figure 5): If no data on LD -50 for the chemical is available a test for LD -50 
determination (OECD 425) should be conducted. This is the same acute test as 
recommended before in vitro genotoxicity tests.  This test should be followed by 
determination of fetotoxicity : OECD 422 (subchronic toxicity).  If the outcome of the 
fetotoxicity test shows that the subs tance is fetotoxic a second tier should be 
performed, with one of the following tests: OECD 415 or OECD416  (chronic toxicity).

 Acute Toxicity  
 Acute oral toxicity –  OECD 425 
OECD Test No. 425: Acute Oral Toxicity –  Up-and- Down -Procedure  (UDP)  
The main test consists of a single ordered dose progression in which animals are 
dosed, one at a time, at a minimum of 48- hour intervals. The first animal 
receives a dose a step below the level of the best estimate of the LD50. If the 
animal survives, the dose for the next animal is increased by a factor of  3.2 times 
the original dose; if it dies, the dose for the next animal is decreased by a similar 
dose progression. Each animal should be observed carefully for up to 48 hours 
before ma king a decision on whether and how much to dose the next animal. 
That decision is based on the 48 -hour survival pattern of all the animals up to 
that time. A combination of stopping criteria is used to keep the number of 
animals low while adjusting the dos ing pattern to reduce the effect of a poor 
starting  value or low slope . Dosing is stopped when one  of these criteria is 
satisfied , at which time an estimate of the LD50 and a confidence interval are 
calculated for the test based on the status of all the an imals at termination. For 
most applications, testing will be completed with only 4 animals after initial  
reversal in animal outcome. The LD50 is calculated using the method of 
maximum likelihood. The results of the main test procedure serve as the starting  
point for a computational procedure to provide a confidence interval estimate 
where feasible.   Principles:

  Mutagenicity and Genotoxicity  
 In vitro genotoxicity – OECD 471  
 
OECD Test No. 471: Bacterial Reverse Mutation Test  
The bacterial reverse mutation test uses amino- acid requiring at least five strains 
of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli to detect point mutations by base 
substitutions or frameshifts. The principle of this bacterial reverse mutation test is 
that it detects mutations which revert mutations present in the test strains and 
restore the functional capability of the bacteria to synthesize an essential amino 
acid.  
 Principles:  
Suspensions of bacterial cells are exposed to the test substance (liquid or solid) in 
the presence and in the absence of an exogenous metabolic activation system. At 
least five different analysable concentrations of the test substance should be 
used. The recommended maximum test concentration for soluble non- cytotoxic 
substances is 5 mg/plate  or 5 ml/plate. There are two methods: the plate 
incorporation method and the preincubation method. For both techniques, after 
two or three days of incubation at 37°C, revertant colonies are counted and 
compared to the number of spontaneous revertant colonies on solvent control 
plates.  
 
 
 
 In vitro genotoxicity – OECD 473  
 
OECD Test No. 473: In vitro Mammalian Chromosome Aberration Test  
The purpose of the in vitro chromosome aberration test is to identify agents that 
cause structural chromosome aberrations in cultured mammalian somatic cells. 
Structural aberrations may be of two types: chromosome or chromatid.  
The in vitro chromosome abe rration test may employ cultures of established cell 
lines, cell strains or primary cell cultures. Cell cultures are exposed to the test 
substance (liquid or solid) both with and without metabolic activation during 
about 1.5 normal cell cycle lengths. At l east three analysable concentrations of 
the test substance should be used. At each concentration duplicate cultures 
should normally be used. At predetermined intervals after exposure of cell 
cultures to the test substance, the cells are treated with a meta phase -arresting 
substance, harvested, stained. Metaphase cells are analysed microscopically for 
the presence of chromosome aberrations.  Principles:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 13 Test Protocol for Emission Compound Toxicity  
  In vitro genotoxicity – OECD 487  
 
OECD Test No. 487: Mammalian  Micronucleus Test  
The mammalian in vitro micronucleus test is used for the detection of damage 
induced by the test substance to the chromosomes or the mitotic apparatus of 
mammalian cells in culture. Cell cultures are exposed to the test substances both 
with and without an exogenous source of metabolic activation unless primary 
cells with metabolizing capability are used. After exposure to the test substance, 
cell cultures are grown for a period sufficient to allow chromosome or spindle 
damage to lead to the formation of mic ronuclei in interphase cells and to trigger 
the aneuploidy sensitive cell stage (G2/M). Harvested and stained interphase cells 
are then analysed microscopically for the presence of micronuclei.  Principles:  
Ideally, micronuclei should only be scored in those cells that  have completed 
nuclear division following exposure to the test chemical. In cultures that have 
been treated with a cytokinesis blocker, this is achieved by scoring only 
binucleate cells. In the absence of a blocker, it is important to demonstrate that 
the majority of mononucleate cells are likely to have undergone at least one cell 
division since exposure to the test substance. For all protocols, it is important 
that cell proliferation is demonstrated in both control and treated cells, together 
with aassessment of cytotoxicity in the treated cells scored for micronuclei.  
 
 
 
 In vitro genotoxicity – OECD 476  
OECD Test No. 476: In vitro Mammalian Cell Gene Mutation Test  
The in vitro mammalian cell gene mutation test can be used to detect gene 
mutations induced by chemical substances. In the cell lines the most commonly -
used genetic endpoints measure mutation at thymidine kinase (TK) and 
hypoxanthine -guanine phosphoribosyl  transferase (HPRT), and a transgene of 
xanthineguanine phosphoribosyl transferase (XPRT). The TK, HPRT and XPRT 
mutation tests detect different spectra of genetic events.  
Cells in suspension or monolayer culture are exposed to, at least four analysable 
concentrations of the test substance, both with and without metabolic activation, 
for a suitable period of time. They are subcultured to determine cytotoxicity and 
to allow phenotypic expression prior to mutant selection. It is recommended to 
utilise at lea st 106cells. Cytotoxicity is usually determined by measuring the 
relative cloning efficiency (survival) or relative total growth of the cultures after 
the treatment period. The treated cultures are maintained in growth medium for a 
sufficient period of tim e, characteristic of each selected locus and cell type, to 
allow near -optimal phenotypic expression of induced mutations. Mutant frequency 
is determined by seeding known numbers of cells in medium containing the 
selective agent to detect mutant cells, and in medium without selective agent to 
determine the cloning efficiency (viability). After a suitable incubation time, 
colonies are counted.  Principles:  
 
 
 
 14 Test Protocol for Emission Compound Toxicity  
  In vivo genotoxicity –  OECD 474  
 
OECD Test No. 474: Mammalian Erythrocyte Micronucleus Test  
The mammalian in vivo micronucleus test is used for the detection of damage 
induced by the test substance to the chromosomes or the mitotic apparatus of 
erythroblasts, by analysis of erythrocytes as sampled in bone marrow and/or 
peripheral blood cells of a nimals, usually rodents (mice or rats).  
The purpose of the micronucleus test is to identify substances (liquid or solid) 
that cause cytogenetic damage which results in the formation of micronuclei 
containing lagging chromosome fragments or whole chromosom es. An increase in 
the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in treated animals is 
an indication of induced chromosome damage. Animals are exposed to the test 
substance by an appropriate route (usually by gavage using a stomach tube or a 
suitable intubation cannula, or by intraperitoneal injection). Bone marrow and/or 
blood cells are collected, prepared and stained. Preparations are analyzed for the 
presence of micronuclei. Each treated and control group must include at least 5 
analysable a nimals per sex. Administration of the treatments consists of a single 
dose of test substance or two daily doses (or more). The limit dose is 2000 
mg/kg/body weight/day for treatment up to 14 days, and 1000 mg/kg/body 
weight/day for treatment longer than 14  days.  Principles:  
 
 
 
 
 In vivo genotoxicity –  OECD 475  
OECD Test No. 475: Mammalian Bone Marrow Chromosome Aberration Test  
The mammalian in vivo chromosome aberration test is used for the detection of 
structural chromosome aberrations induced by test compounds in bone marrow 
cells of animals, usually rodents (rats, mice and Chinese hamsters). Structural 
chromosome aberrations may be of two types: chromosome or chromatid.  
Animals are exposed to the test substance (liquid or solid) by an appropriate 
route of exposure (usually by gavage using a stomach tube or a suitable 
intubation cannula, or by intraperitoneal injection) and ar e sacrificed at 
appropriate times after treatment. Prior to sacrifice, animals are treated with a 
metaphase -arresting agent. Chromosome preparations are then made from the 
bone marrow cells and stained, and metaphase cells are analysed for 
chromosome aberrations. Each treated and control group must include at least 5 
analysable animals per sex. The limit dose is 2000 mg/kg/body weight/day for 
treatment up to 14 days, and 1000 mg/kg/body weight/day for treatment longer 
than 14 days.  Principles:

  Chronic Toxicity and Carcinogenicity  
 
 Chronic Toxicity / Carcinogenocity –  OECD 453  
OECD Test No. 453: Combined Chronic Toxicity/Carcinogenicity Studies  
The objective of a combined chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity study is to identify 
carcinogenic and the majority of chronic effects, and to determine dose -response 
relationships following prolonged and repeated exposure.  
 
The rat is typically used for this  study. For rodents, each dose group and 
concurrent control group intended for the carcinogenicity phase of the study 
should contain at least 50 animals of each sex, while for the chronic toxicity 
phase of the study should contain at least 10 animals of ea ch sex.  At least three 
dose levels should be used, in addition to the concurrent control group for both 
the chronic toxicity phase and the carcinogenicity phase of the study. The three 
main routes of administration are oral, dermal, and inhalation. The Te st Guideline 
focuses on the oral route of administration.  
 
The period of dosing and duration of the study is normally 12 months for the 
chronic phase, and 24 months for the carcinogenicity phase. The study report 
should include:   measurements (weighing) an d regular detailed observations 
(haematological examination, urinalysis, clinical chemistry), as well as necropsy 
procedures and histopathology. All these observations permit the detection of 
neoplastic effects and a determination of carcinogenic potential  as well as the 
general toxicity.  Principles:

 Reproduction Toxicity  
 Reproduction toxicity –  OECD 415  
OECD Test No. 415: One -Generation Reproduction Toxicity Study  
This Test Guideline for reproduction testing is designed to provide general 
information concerning the effects of a test substance (Solid, liquid, gas or 
vapour) on male and female reproductive performance. The test substance is 
administered orally in grad uated doses to several groups of males and females.  
Males should be dosed during growth and for at least one complete 
spermatogenic cycle; females of the Parent generation should be dosed for at 
least two complete oestrous cycles. The animals are then mat ed. The test 
substance is administered to both sexes during the mating period and thereafter 
only to females during pregnancy and for the duration of the nursing period. This 
Test Guideline is intended primarily for use with the rat or mouse. Each test and  
control group should contain a sufficient number of animals to yield about 20 
pregnant females at or near term. Three test groups, at least, should be used. It 
is recommended that the test substance be administered in the diet or drinking 
water. A limit t est may be performed if no effects would be expected at a dose of 
1000 mg/kg bw/d. The results of this study include measurements (weighing, 
food consumption) and daily and detailed observations, each day preferably at 
the same time, as well as gross necro psy and histopathology. The findings of a 
reproduction toxicity study should be evaluated in terms of the observed effects, 
necropsy and microscopic findings. A properly conducted reproduction test should 
provide a satisfactory estimation of a no -effect le vel and an understanding of 
adverse effects on reproduction, parturition, lactation and postnatal growth.  Principles:

general information concerning the effects of a test substance on the integrity 
and performance of the male and female reproductive systems, and on the 
growth and developmen t of the offspring. The test substance is administered 
daily in graduated doses to several groups of males and females.  
Males and females of the Parent generation (5 -9 weeks old) should be dosed 
during growth, during their mating, during the resulting pre gnancies, and through 
the weaning of their first generation offspring. The administration of the 
substance is continued to first generation offspring during their growth into 
adulthood, mating and production of a second generation (until the weaning). The 
rat is the preferred species for testing. Each test and control group should contain 
a sufficient number of animals to yield preferably not less than 20 pregnant 
females at or near parturition. At least three dose levels and a concurrent control 
shall be u sed. It is recommended that the test substance be administered orally 
(by diet, drinking water or gavage). A limit test may be performed if no effects 
would be expected at a dose of 1000 mg/kg bw/d. The results of this study 
include: measurements (weighing , sperm parameters, oestrus cycle parameters 
and offspring parameters), clinical daily observations, as well as gross necropsy 
and histopathology. The findings of this two -generation reproduction toxicity Principles:  17 Test Protocol for Emission Compound Toxicity  
 study should be evaluated in terms of the observed effects including necropsy 
and microscopic findings. A properly conducted reproductive toxicity test should 
provide a satisfactory estimation of a no -effect level and an understanding of 
adverse effects on reproduction, parturition, lactation, postnatal de velopment 
including growth and sexual development.  
 
 
 Reproduction toxicity –  OECD 422  
OECD Test No. 422: Combined Repeated Dose Toxicity Study with the 
Reproduction/Developmental Toxicity Screening Test  
The test substance is administered in graduated doses to several groups of males 
and females. Males should be dosed for a minimum of four weeks; females should 
be dosed throughout the study (approximately 54 days). Normally, matings "one 
male to one female " should be used in this study.  
This Test Guideline is designed for use with the rat. It is recommended that the 
test substance be administered orally by gavage. This should be done in a single 
dose daily to the animals using a stomach tube or a suitable intubation cannula. 
Each group should be started with at least 10 animals of each sex. Generally, at 
least three test groups and a control group should be used. Dose levels should be 
selected taking into account any existing toxicity and (toxico -) kinetic data 
available. The limit test corresponds to one dose level of at least 1000 mg/kg 
body weight. The results of this study include measurements (weighing, 
food/water consumption) and daily detailed observations (including sensory 
reactivity to stimuli), pr eferably each day at the same time, as well as gross 
necropsy and histopathology. The findings of this toxicity study should be 
evaluated in terms of the observed effects, necropsy and microscopic findings. 
The evaluation will include the relationship betw een the dose of the test 
substance and the presence or absence of observations. Because of the short 
period of treatment of the male, the histopathology of the testis and epididymus 
must be considered along with the fertility data, when assessing male 
reproduction effects.  Principles:

Part 1B –  Ecotoxicity Testing  
 
1B-1: Selection of compartments and trophic  levels and endpoints for 
ecotoxicity testing  
 
Acute aquatic tests should always be the first choice to use if no ecotoxicity data 
exist, and  with the use of three trophic  levels:  
 
• Primary producers (phytoplankton)  
• Herbivors ( Daphnia magna preferred organism  
• Fish (e.g. rainbow trout - Oncorhynchus mykiss ) 
 
These tests are performed as inhibition or lethality tests.  
 
In addition to acute aquatic tests, the test organisms representing other relevant 
compartments should be considered.  
 
If a flue gas test substance is considered to resist atmospheric processes and 
expected to be potentially precipitated on ground by wet or dry precipitation an 
acute tests for soil and vegetation toxicity test should be considered. When flue gas 
components are precipitated in soil an acute soil test should be considered.  
Ecotoxicity tests for vegetation plants may also be relevant for flue gas deposition, 
performed  as acute tests to plants.  Insect tests may also be considered, but are 
currently not included in this Protocol.   
 
Long -term tests may also be considered. This may be of special importance for 
hazard assessment, as comparison of results between acute and chronic tests.  
 
 
1B-2: decisions or test methods for ecotoxicity  
 
We suggest to include acute aquatic tests for three trophic levels as mandatory.  
 
Additional tests should be considered if the substance is considered “toxic” to one or 
more of the aquatic test organisms (mandatory tests). Threshold to toxicity should 
be set, based on expert opinion1. The requirements for further testing is further 
substantiated if the substance appear to be persistent in the environment, judged 
from its biodegradability2
   
Ecotoxicity testing should be conducted according to the flow -sheet shown in Figure 
6.

 Acute aquatic ecotoxicity –  OECD 201  
OECD Test No. 201: Alga, Growth Inhibition Test  
The purpose of this test is to determine the effects of a substance on the growth 
of freshwater microalgae and/or cyanobacteria. Exponentially growing test 
organisms are exposed to the test substance in batch cultures over a period of 
normally 72 hours.  
The system response is the reduction of growth in a series of algal cultures 
exposed to, at least, five concentrations of a test substance. Three replicates at 
each test concentration should be used. The response is evaluated as a function 
of the exposure c oncentration in comparison with the average growth of control 
cultures. The cultures are allowed unrestricted exponential growth under nutrient 
sufficient conditions (two alternative growth media: the OECD and the AAP) and 
continuous fluorescent illuminati on. Growth and growth inhibition are quantified 
from measurements of the algal biomass as a function of time. The limit test 
corresponds to one dose level of 100 mg/L. This study includes: the 
determination, at least daily, of the algal biomass; the measur e of the pH (at the 
beginning and at the end); microscopic observation. This Test Guideline describes 
two response variables: average specific growth rate, and yield.  Principles:  Aquatic Toxicity

ECD Test No. 202: Daphnia sp. Acute Immobilisation Test  
This Test Guideline describes an acute toxicity test to assess effects of chemicals 
towards daphnids (usually Daphnia magna Staus).  
Young daphnids, aged less than 24 hours at the start of the test, are exposed to 
the test substance at a range of concentrations (at least five concentrations) for a 
period of 48 hours. Immobilisation is recorded at 24 hours and 48 hours and 
compared with control values. The results are analysed in order to calculate the 
EC50 at 48h. Dete rmination of the EC50 at 24h is optional. At least 20 animals, 
preferably divided into four groups of five animals each, should be used at each 
test concentration and for the controls. At least 2 ml of test solution should be 
provided for each animal (i.e.  a volume of 10 ml for five daphnids per test 
vessel). The limit test corresponds to one dose level of 100 mg/L. The study 
report should include the observation for immobilized daphnids at 24 and 48 
hours after the beginning of the test and the measures of  dissolved oxygen, pH, 
concentration of the test substance, at the beginning and end of the test.  Principles:  
 
 
 Acute aquatic ecotoxicity –  OECD 203  
ECD Test No. 203: Fish, Acute Toxicity Test  
The fish are exposed to the test substance preferably for a period of 96 hours. 
Mortalities are recorded at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours and the concentrations which 
kill 50 per cent of the fish (LC50) are determined where possible.  
One or more species may be used, the choice being at the discretion of the 
testing laboratory. At least seven fishes must be used at each test concentration 
and in the controls. The test substance should be administered to, at least, five 
concentrations in a geometric series with a factor preferably not exceeding 2.2. 
The limit test corresponds to one dose level of 100 mg/L. This study includes the 
observations of fish at least after 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours. The cumulative 
percentage mortality for each exposure period is plotted agai nst concentration on 
logarithmic probability paper.  Principles:  
 
 
 Soil ecotoxicity –  OECD 207  
ECD Test No. 207: Earthworm, Acute Toxicity Tests  
This Test Guideline includes two methods: a paper contact toxicity test and an 
artificial soil test. The recommended specie is Eisenia foetida (Michaelsen).  
The initial screening test (filter paper contact test) involves exposing earthworms 
to test substa nces on moist filter paper in order to identify potentially toxic 
chemicals to earthworms in soil. Five or more treatment levels in a geometric 
series and, at least, ten replicates (one worm per vial) for each treatment should 
be used. Tests are done in th e dark and for a period of 48 hours. The artificial soil 
test gives toxicity data more representative of natural exposure of earthworms to 
chemicals. It involves keeping earthworms in samples of a precisely defined Principles:  
21 Test Protocol for Emission Compound Toxicity  
 artificial soil. Five concentrations, in a geometric series, of the test substance 
have been applied. One concentration resulting in no mortality and one resulting 
in total mortality should be used. Four replicates for each treatment are 
recommended. Mortality is assessed 7 and 14 days after appl ication.  
 
 
 Plant ecotoxicity –  OECD 208  
ECD Test No. 208: Terrestrial Plant Test: Seedling Emergence and Seedling Growth 
Test  
 This Test Guideline is designed to assess effects on seedling emergence and 
early growth of higher plants following exposure to the test substance applied to 
the soil surface or into the soil.  
Seeds are placed in contact with soil treated with the test s ubstance and 
evaluated for effects following usually 14 to 21 days after 50 % emergence of the 
seedlings in the control group. Endpoints measured are visual assessment of 
seedling emergence, biomass measurements, shoot height, and the visible 
detrimental e ffects on different parts of the plant. The test can be conducted in 
order to determine the dose -response curve, or at a single concentration/rate as 
a limit test, according to the aim of the study. An appropriate statistical analysis 
is used to obtain eff ective concentration ECx or effective application rate ERx for 
the most sensitive parameter(s) of interest. Also, the no observed effect 
concentration (NOEC) and lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) can be 
calculated in this test.  Principles:  
 
 
 
 Long -term aquatic ecotoxicity –  OECD 211  
ECD Test No. 211: Daphnia magna Reproduction Test  
 The test method described in this Test Guideline assesses the effect of chemicals 
on the reproductive output of Daphnia magna Straus. To this end, young female 
Daphnia are exposed to the test substance added to water at a range of 
concentrations (at least five). For semi -static tests, at least 10 animals at each 
test concentration and for flow -through tests, 40 animals divided into four groups 
of 10 animals at each test concentration, are used. The test duration is 21 days. 
Reproductive output of the paren t animals and the total number of living offspring 
produced per parent alive at the end of the test should be reported. The study 
report should also include: the daily counting of the offspring, the daily recording 
of the parent mortality, the weekly measu rement of oxygen concentration, 
temperature, hardness and pH values and the determination of the 
concentrations of test substance. Optionally, the sex ratio of the offspring may be 
recorded. The reproductive output of the animals exposed to the test substa nce is 
compared to that of the control in order to determine the lowest observed effect 
concentration (LOEC) and hence the no observed effect concentration (NOEC). In 
addition, and as far as possible, the data are analyzed using a regression model 
in order to estimate the concentration that would cause an x % reduction in 
reproductive output.  Principles:  
 
 
22 Test Protocol for Emission Compound Toxicity  
 Part 1C –  Biodegradability Testing  
 
1C-1: Selection of degradability principles and compartments  
 
Bodegradability testing of flue gas components should only be performed on pure 
substances. Tests should always be conducted to decide whether each compound is 
ready biodegradable or not. Test for ready biodegradability should be supplemented 
with test for  inherent biodegradability, if necessary.  
 
Most tests for ready and inherent biodegradability are performed with freshwater -
based media and microbial inocula from municipal sewage or activated sludge. If 
flooding of active soil systems appear oxygen conce ntrations may be reduced and 
anaerobic conditions appear. Since aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation differs 
with respect to degradation mechanisms and electron acceptors, it is advisable  to 
include anaerobic degradation, primarily as a test combining aero bic and anaerobic 
conditions.  
 
Biodegradation of chemicals is concentration -dependant. Degradation rates may 
increase with elevated substance concentrations, but are reduced if concentrations 
reach toxic levels for a chemical. Biodegradation tests require  test substance 
concentrations in ppm -levels, and toxic chemicals may inhibit biodegradation at 
these levels. Therefore simulation tests may be conducted with low environmentally 
relevant concentrations. If possible radio -labelled (e.g. 14C-labelled chemic als can be 
used. If a simulation method is to be performed, a test for biodegradation in soil is 
preferable.   
 
1C-2: Decisions or test methods for biodegradability  
 
Biodegradability testing should be conducted according to the flow -sheet shown in 
Figure 7.  
 
We suggest to include a ready biodegradation test as mandatory, if data are not available yet. If test substance is ready biodegradable (i.e. > 60 % BOD of ThOD / CO
2 
evolution of ThCO 2 or > 70 % DOC removal) no further testing should be needed. 
When n ot ready biodegradable, t he test substance should be subjected to an 
inherent biodegradability test and to a test for abiotic degradation (hydrolysis).  
 If a substance is judged as at least primary inherent biodegradable (i.e. ≥  20 % of 
theoretical values ) a simulation test should be considered based on “expert 
opinion”. Expert opinion should include an evaluation of the risk for the substance ending up in terrestrial systems, and if the substance is regarded as potentially toxic to aquatic organisms (see 1B -2). If this is realistic a soil simulated test may be 
conducted.    If the outcome of an inherent biodegradability test is that the test substance is not 
judged as at least primary inherent biodegradable  (i.e. < 20 % of theoretical values) , 
a soil simulation test should be recommended if “expert opinion” judge the 23 Test Protocol for Emission Compound Toxicity  
 possibility for the substance to reach the soil compartment as relevant.  Photo -
transformation test may also be considered, although not yet included in the current 
Protocol.

 Ready biodegradability –  OECD 301  
 
OECD Test No. 301: Ready Biodegradability  
 This Test Guideline describes six methods that permit the screening of chemicals 
for ready biodegradability in an aerobic aqueous medium. The methods are: the 
DOC Die -Away, the CO2 Evolution (Modified Sturm Test), the MITI (I) (Ministry of 
International T rade and Industry, Japan), the Closed Bottle, the Modified OECD 
Screening and the Manometric Respirometry.  
A solution, or suspension, of the test substance, well determined/described, in a 
mineral medium is inoculated and incubated under aerobic condition s in the dark 
or in diffuse light. The running parallel blanks with inoculum but without test 
substance permits to determined the endogenous activity of the inoculum. A 
reference compound (aniline, sodium acetate or sodium benzoate) is run in 
parallel to c heck the operation of the procedures. Normally, the test lasts for 28 
days. At least two flasks or vessels containing the test substance plus inoculum, 
and at least two flasks or vessels containing inoculum only should be used; single 
vessels are sufficien t for the reference compound. In general, degradation is 
followed by the determination of parameters such as DOC, CO2 production and 
oxygen uptake. The pass levels for ready biodegradability are 70% removal of 
DOC and 60% of ThOD or ThCO2 production for re spirometric methods. These 
pass values have to be reached in a 10 -d window within the 28 -d period of the 
test. Principles:  
 
 
 
 Inherent biodegradability –  OECD 302A  
 
OECD Test No. 302A: Inherent Biodegradability: Modified SCAS Test  
 This Test Guideline describes a method which is an adaptation of the Soap and 
Detergent Association semi -continuous activated sludge (SCAS) procedure for 
assessing the primary biodegradation of alkyl benzene sulphonate. The test does 
not simulate those co nditions experienced in a sewage treatment plant.  
Activated sludge from a sewage treatment plant is placed in an aeration (SCAS) 
unit. The test compound (non -volatile, water soluble, organic, non -inhibitoring to 
bacteria at the test concentration) and settled domestic sewage are added, and 
the mixture is aerated for 23 hours. The aeration is then stopped, the sludge 
allowed to settle and the supernatant liquor is removed. The sludge remaining in 
the aeration chamber is then mixed with a further aliquot of test compound and 
sewage and the cycle is repeated. The above fill and draw procedure is repeated 
daily throughout the test. A high concentration of aerobic micro -organisms is 
used. The length of the test for compounds showing little or no biodegradation i s 
indeterminate, but experience suggests that this should be at least 12 weeks. 
Biodegradation is established by determination of the dissolved organic carbon 
content of the supernatant liquor. This value is compared with that found for the 
liquor obtained  from a control tube dosed with settled sewage only.  Principles:

 Inherent biodegradability –  OECD 302B  
OECD Test No. 302B: Inherent Biodegradability: Zahn- Wellens/ EVPA Test  
 This Test Guideline describes the Zahn -Wellens/EMPA Test. It is used to 
determine inherent biodegradability.  
A mixture containing the non -volatile and water soluble test substance, mineral 
nutrients and a relatively large amount of activated sludge in aq ueous medium is 
agitated and aerated at 20 -25°C in the dark or in diffuse light, for up to 28 days. 
Blank controls, containing activated sludge and mineral nutrients but no test 
substance, are run in parallel. The functional capability of the activated slu dge is 
tested using a reference compound (ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, lauryl 
sulfonate or aniline). In a typical run 1 or 2 vessels for the test suspension and 
for the inoculum blank, 1 for procedure control are used. The biodegradation 
process is monitored by determination of DOC, Dissolved Organic Carbon, (or 
COD, Chemical Oxygen Demand) in filtered samples, taken at daily or other time 
intervals. It is mandatory to follow DOC in the test suspension and inoculum 
blanks in parallel. The ratio of eliminated DOC (or COD), corrected for the blank, 
after each time interval, to the initial DOC value is expressed as the percentage 
biodegradation at the sampling time. The percentage biodegradation is plotted 
against time to give the biodegradation curve. T he test is considered valid if the 
procedural control shows the removal of the reference compound by at least 70% 
within 14d and if DOC (or COD) in the test suspension is removed relatively 
gradually over days or weeks, since this indicates biodegradation.  Principles:  
 
 
 
 
 Inherent biodegradability –  OECD 302C  
 
OECD Test No. 302C: Inherent Biodegradability: Modified MITI Test (II)  
 This Test Guideline describes the modified MITI test (II). This test permits the 
measurement of the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and the analysis of 
residual chemicals in order to evaluate the inherent biodegradability of chemical 
substances which have  been found by the Standard MITI Method (I) to be low 
degradable.  
An automated closed -system oxygen consumption measuring apparatus (BOD -
meter) is used. Chemicals to be tested are inoculated in the testing vessels (six 
bottles with different quantities of  test chemical) with micro -organisms. In order 
to check the activity of the inoculum, the use of control substances (aniline, 
sodium acetate or sodium benzoate) is desirable. During the test period, the BOD 
is measured continuously. Biodegradability is cal culated on the basis of BOD and 
supplemental chemical analysis, such as measurement of the dissolved organic 
carbon concentration, concentration of residual chemicals, etc. The BOD curve is 
obtained continuously and automatically for 14 to 28 days. After the 14 to 28 
days of testing, pH, residual chemicals and intermediates in the testing vessels 
are analysed.  Principles:

 Simulation test in soil –  OECD 307  
 
OECD Test No. 307: Aerobic and Anaerobic Transformation in Soil  
 The method described in this Test Guideline is designed for evaluating aerobic 
and anaerobic transformation of chemicals in soil. The experiments are performed 
to determine the rate of transformation of the test substance, and the nature and 
rates of form ation and decline of transformation products, to which plants and soil 
organisms may be exposed.  
About 50 to 200 g soil samples (a sandy loam or silty loam or loam or loamy 
sand) are treated with the test substance and incubated in the dark, in biometer -
type flasks or in flow -through systems under controlled laboratory conditions. The 
treatment rate should correspond to the highest application rate of a crop 
protection product recommended in the use instructions. Also untreated soil 
samples are incubated u nder test conditions. These samples are used for biomass 
measurements during and at the end of the studies. The rate and pathway 
studies should normally not exceed 120 days. Duplicate incubation flasks are 
removed at appropriate time intervals and the soil  samples extracted with 
appropriate solvents, of different polarity, and analysed for the test substance 
and/or transformation products. Volatile products are also collected for analysis 
using appropriate adsorption devices. Using 14C -labelled material, th e various 
mineralisation rates of the test substance can be measured by trapping evolved 
14CO2 and a mass balance, including the formation of soil bound residues, can be 
established.  Principles:  
 
 
 
 Abiotic degradability -  Hydrolysis – OECD 111  
 
OECD Test No. 111: Hydrolysis as a Function of pH  
This Test Guideline describes a laboratory test method to assess abiotic hydrolytic 
transformations of chemicals in aquatic systems at pH values normally found in 
the environment (pH 4 - 9). This Gu ideline is designed as a tiered approach; each 
tier is triggered by the results of the previous tier.  Sterile aqueous buffer 
solutions of different pH values (pH 4, 7 and 9) are treated with the non -labelled 
or labelled test substance (only one concentrati on, which should not exceed 0.01 
M or half of the saturation concentration). They are incubated in the dark under 
controlled laboratory conditions (at constant temperatures). After appropriate 
time intervals, buffer solutions are analysed for the test subs tance and for 
hydrolysis products. The preliminary test should be carried out for 5 days at 50 ± 
0.5°C and pH 4.0, 7.0 and 9.0. The second tier consists of the hydrolysis of 
unstable substances, and the third tier is the identification of hydrolysis produc ts. 
The higher Tier tests should be conducted until 90 % hydrolysis of the test 
substance is observed or for 30 days whichever comes first.  Principles:

Part 1D –  Hazard analyses 
 
The terms “Hazard” has been defined by OECD and by REACH (e.g. 
http://guidance.echa.europa.eu/docs/guidance_document/information_requirements_en.htm). Hazard is the potential to cause harm.  
   
1D-1: Methods for health hazard  
 
In the present project exposure to humans may occur in an occupational setting or as a result of chemicals being dispersed to the neighbourhood  of the production 
plant.  
 
 
Exposure to the general population around an industrial facility like Mongstad is 
characterised by low -level continuous exposure. We therefore need to focus on compounds 
causing effects that may occur after long -term and low -level exposure.  
 
A hazard clas sification system based on GESAMP -EHS3 system based on Hazard 
analyses will be performed with data generated from mammalian toxicity methods4
 .  
Ranking will be used for long -term exposure based on the following hazards5
 :  
 
• Carcinogenicity (C) 
• Mutagenicit y (M)  
• Reproductive effects (R) 
• Sensitization, primarily by inhalation (S)  
 
The symbols C, M, R and S indicate:  
C Shown to induce or increase cancer in animals or man  
M Shown to cause increased incidence of permanent changes in the amount or 
structure of the genetic material  
R Shown to cause adverse effects on reproductive ability or capacity, or the 
development of offspring  
S Shown to be a sensitizer (skin or respiratory)  
 
Hazard of substances should be based on literature search and quality evaluation of 
available data. Typical sources for health information are:  
                                                 
3 GESAMP: Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection  
4 Alternatively, a hazard classification system based on the Global Harmonisation System (GHS) may 
be used. The GESAMP and GHS systems are nearly identical  
5 Acute toxicity ( oral and dermal toxicity ) will play a minor role in the final overall hazard assessment.  28 Test Protocol for Emission Compound Toxicity

 When data are not available from reliable sources testing should be considered (see Part 1A).     30 Test Protocol for Emission Compound Toxicity  
  
1D-2: Hazard assessment methods  as part of health  risk evaluation   
 
If urgent need to develop a preliminary risk assessment a hazard profile may be 
developed for a group of substances, based on worst case criteria . We suggest to use 
“occupational exposure limit s” (OEL s) taken from the lowest Scandinavian values. If 
OEL do not exist for a compound a “no otherwise specified” (NOS) approach may be used. We have not performed any quality assessment of the toxicity data which is 
used for the basis of OEL.  For instance if OEL for a nitrosamine has not been 
specified t he toxicology profile for a compound nitrosamine (NOS) is the worst case 
entry for each endpoint of toxicology testing that we have been able to obtain.  We 
suggest to use assessment factor of 100, i.e. the lowest OEL should be divided by 100.   
 If a good dataset of Derived No -effect levels (DNEL) , or preferably Derived Minimal -
effect levels (DMEL) is available, a non -threshold approach may be selected. In that 
case a large assessment factor of 10,000 is appropriate. A dose descriptor (e.g. 
carcinogenicity as endpoint) is selected, and a toxic dose (e.g. TD50) is divided on the 
assessment factor for determination of DNEL/ DMEL . 
 These approaches are used as part of a risk evaluation, and they do not represent a full risk assessment, since exposure concentrations are not available  
    
  
  
1D-3: Methods for hazard assessment as part of environmental risk 
evaluation  
 
For environmental hazard evaluation we suggest that a predicted no -effect 
concentration (PNEC)  is used .  This system is a well established system and 
recommended for environmental hazard and risk analyse s by the European 
Communion, as described in the Technical Guidance Documents (TGD)(
http://ecb.jrc.ec .europa.eu/tgd/
A PNEC requires reliable ecotoxicity d ata from at least three trophic  levels with 
aquatic organisms (Part 1B). The source of information for ecotoxicity data may be:  ).  
 
IUCLID data sheet:
ECOTOX:  http://ecb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esis/  
http://cfpub.epa.gov/ecotox/  
 SciFinder: http://www.cas.org/products/scifindr/index.html  
 
If reliable acute toxicity data from three trophic levels are not available ecotoxicity tests should be performed, preferably with species representing all t hree trophic 
levels.  
 Based on available results from ecotoxicity information a PNEC may be defined according to the following rules:  31 Test Protocol for Emission Compound Toxicity  
  
1. Select the EC -50 from the acute test with the highest toxicity result (most 
sensitive organism) and define a PNEC by th e use of an assessment factor as 
shown in Table  2 (1000)  
2. If reliable ecotoxicity data are available from long -term chronic test(s), use 
the results from one these tests to establish PNEC (see Table 2), based on no -
effect concentrations (NOEC)  
 
 
 
Table 2  Assessment factors (AF) for ecotoxicity tests  
 
AVAILABLE DATA  ASSESSMENT FACTOR

trophic levels of the base set (fish, Daphnia and algae)

Two long -term NOECs from species representing two

Field data or model ecosystems  Reviewed on a case by

On the bases of the information in Table 2 PNEC should be determined as follows:  
 
1. If data from only acute aquatic toxicity tests are available an AF of 1000 should 
be used to  determine PNEC from the test with the highest ecotoxicity  
2. If PNEC in other soil or sediment compartments is to be determined, ectoxicity 
data from the relevant compartment may be considered for PNEC determination, 
even if some of aquatic tests show higher  ecotoxicity 
3. If data from a long -term ecotoxicity test exist the data from this test should be 
used for PNEC -determination and with an AF or 100.  
4. If data from two or more long -term ecotoxicity test exist and these represent at 
least two different trophic levels, an AF of 50 should be used for the test showing 
the highest ecotoxicity.  
 
These approaches are used as part of a risk evaluation, and they do not represent a full risk assessment, since exposure concentrations are not available  
    
 
 32 Test Protocol for Emission Compound Toxicity  
 Part 1E –  Risk assessment  
 
Risk assessment analyses include the combination of toxicity data with the 
predictions of exposure concentrations. Determination of exposure concentrations 
combine emission data, modelling  of spreading and dispersion in the environment 
and predictions of fate processes for individual flue gas compounds.  
 
We do not recommend risk evaluation until methods for estimation of exposure concentrations are available.

  34 Test Protocol for Emission Compound Toxicity  
  Overview of Test Protocol Part 2  
This part of the test protocol describes the decisions for testing of components 
expected to be part of CO 2-capture emissions. Included in this part are the 
approaches on how to select flue gas substances for hazard evaluation, data sources for obtaining hazard/provisional risk  assessment, selection for further testing, 
choices of testing methods, and how to use data for hazard assessment. A flow -chart 
is shown in Figure 8.  
 The test protoco l will consist of several steps (with reference to Figure 8 ):  
 Step 2A: Selection of chemicals  
Step 2B: Collection of available health and environmental data  
Step 2C: Provisional hazard assessment  
Step 2D: Selection of test methods for mammalian toxicity  
Step 2E: Selection of test methods for ecotoxicity  
Step 2F: Selection of test methods for biodegradation testing  
Step 2G: Final hazard assessment  
 
 Limitations  
This outcome of the procedures described in Part 2 of the Protocol will be data for hazard asses sment of individual components in a flue gas emission mixture. 
Chemical or toxicological interactions between chemicals will not be measured, but may be judged by expert opinions.

  Principles for decisions  
In part 2 of the Protocol the procedures for toxicological characteristics of individual 
chemicals expected to appear in CO 2-capture emission samples will be described. 
This characterisation will depend on selection of appropriate chemicals, based on 
relevant information from expected emission compounds related to capture technology (solvent and capture technology,  flue gas cleaning processes, etc.), 
information from relevant flue gas emission campaigns, and/or expected emission products based on laboratory data and other experimental information.  
 Available health and environmental information will be collected fo r selected test 
substances, and based on this information a test program shall be planned. Procedures for selection and performances of methods for mammalian toxicity, ecotoxicity and biodegradation are described in Part 1 of this Protocol.   
 Information from health and environmental tests will be used for evaluations of 
hazard and risk of individual flue gas substances. Recommended hazard and risk 
approaches  are described in Part 1 of this Protocol. Both for health and 
environmental risk the outcome from hazard/risk analyses of single compounds may 
be used indirectly for predictions of the risk(s) associated with different flue gas 
solvent and capture technologies, as well as gas cleaning processes.  
 
 Health, Safety and Environment (HSE)  
Several of the chemicals associated with flue gas emissions are of health, safety and 
environmental concern. Nitrosamines and nitramines are potential carcinogenic 
chemicals. Amine compounds are in general irritating and corrosive, and some of 
them may hav e sensitizing characteristics.  
 The chemicals must therefore be handled with strict care; all work should be done in fume cupboards. Special care should be taken when storing and handling of nitrosamines and nitramines, following the strictest precautions  recommended in 
the MSDS.  
 Due to the explosive characters of nitramines specific risk analyses should be performed before handling of these chemicals.

  Test Protocol for singe test substances  
PART 2A –  Selection and characterisation of chemicals  
 
 2A-1: Selection of chemicals  
Lists of documented and potential emission products must be provided. These lists 
should be provided from -  
 1. Available data from emission campaigns  
2. Data from published experimental studies  
3. Theoretical studies  
 Expected emission concentrations with relevant CO
2-capture technology should be 
estimated, based on a) emission campaigns, b) judgments of data from laboratory studies or test facility units, and c) estimated from theoretical studies (if possible). Decisions based on b) and c) should be conducted by “expert opinions”  
 All potential emission products should be considered for hazard evaluation, but a ranking of substances should be made, as described below (Part 2B).   
 
PART 2B –  Collection of available health and env ironmental data  
 Available health and environmental (HE) studies should be collected for each chemical. Data should be collected based on CAS numbers, since one chemical may be described by several chemical or generic names. The quality of the data should be 
judged by “expert opinions”. Relevant Sources for HE -data are  shown in Part 1 1D- 1 
and 1D -3.   
 Chemicals should be grouped according to availability of HE -data as follows –   
1. HE information acceptable.  
2. HE information inadequate.  
3. No HE information available.  
 In the case of 2 and 3 suppliers of chemicals may be contacted to ask for additional non-published data. REACH may also be consulted (through the European Chemical 
Agency; ECHA) to check for registration dates and further information. Further, HE -
data from chemically related compounds may be considered. Lack of experimental data may be supplemented by estimated toxicity data based on structure -activity 
relationship ( SAR), although SAR data should be treated with great care. Methods for 
SAR-estimations are described by Joint Research Centre of the European Commission 
for mammalian toxicology and ecotoxicology (several computational tools) and by U S 
EPA for ecotoxicity and degradation (EPISUITE).   
 Based on expert opinions the chemicals should be ranked as described below. SAR estimations should be replaced by data from experimental studies .  38 Test Protocol for Emission Compound Toxicity  
  
Based on available HE -information and potential emissions a ranking system should 
be established for toxicit y testing of chemicals, based on the following criteria:  
 1. High concentrations possible in emissions and potential effects related to mutagenic, carcinogenic and/or reproduction toxicity  
2. High concentrations possible in emissions and potential for persiste nce, 
bioaccumulation and/or  high ecotoxicity  
3. Low concentrations probable  in emissions and potential effects related to 
mutagenic, carcinogenic and/or reproduction toxicity  
4. Low concentrations probable in emissions and potential for persistence, 
bioaccumulation and/or  high ecotoxicity  
5. High concentrations possible in emissions, but no potential effects related to mutagenic, carcinogenic or reproduction toxicity, and no potential for 
persistence, bioaccumulation or ecotoxicity 
6. Low concentrations probable in emissions, but no potential effects related to 
mutagenic, carcinogenic or reproduction toxicity, and no potential for persistence, bioaccumulation or ecotoxicity 
 Chemicals ranked within categories 1 to 4 should be tested if relevant HE -data are 
lacking  or judged to be of inadequate quality (expert opinion).  
 
PART 2C–  Provisional hazard assessment  
   
Based on the information collected as described above a provisional hazard assessment can be performed.   For hazard assessment based on available data consult section 1 -D1 and/1D- 2 
(human health hazard as part of provisional risk analyses) and 1 -D3 (hazard 
assessment as part of provisional environmental risk analyses ).  
 
If decided that essential information for human health or environment are not 
available a testing program should be planned. By “not essential ” information the 
following are included:  
 
1. Inadequate data for mutagenicity/genotoxicity/carcinogenicity  
2. Inadequate data for reproduction toxicity  
3. Inadequate data for ecotoxicity  
4. Inadequate data fo r degradability  
 “Inadequate data” may be interpreted as a) data lacking, b) quality of data poor or uncertain, or c) other insufficient information as judged by expert opinion.   Planning of test programs are shown below (section 2D).  
 
 
 39 Test Protocol for Emission Compound Toxicity  
 PART 2D – Selection of mammalian toxicity methods  
 
The selection of mammalian toxicity methods will depend on the available 
information and the judgment of the quality of this information.  
 
Methods for long -term effects should be prioritised, i.e. 
mutagen icity/genotoxicity/carcinogenicity and reproduction toxicity.  
 The test requirements, flow -sheets and test methods for these methods are 
described in 
Part 1A – Mammalian Toxicity Methods
 .   
Data from mammalian toxicity tests of single chemicals should be  used for 
characterisation of the hazard associated with the chemical, i.e. if the chemical is mutagenic, carcinogenic and/or toxic to reproduction , and for a provisional risk 
assessment based on non -threshold or worst case approach, depending on the 
toxicity data .  
 
 
PART 2E – Selection of ecotoxicity tests  
 
The selection of ecotoxicity methods will depend on the available information and the judgment of the quality of this information.  
 Chemicals with inadequate data for ecotoxicity should be tested in at  least three 
trophoc levels of acute aquatic tests (phytoplankton, herbivores, fish) . 
 
The test requirements, flow -sheets and test methods for these methods are 
described in 
Part 1B – Ecotoxicity Methods
 .   
Data from ecotoxicity tests of single chemicals should be used for characterisation of 
the potential risk associated with the chemical, i.e. determination of PNEC.  
  
PART 2F – Selection of biodegradation tests  
 The selection of biodegradation methods will depend on the available information 
and the judgment of the quality of this information.  
 
Chemicals with inadequate data for biodegradation should be tested for at least ready biodegradability.   The test requirements, flow -sheets and test methods for these methods are 
described in 
Part 1C – Biodegradation Methods
 .   
For risk assessment biodegradation may be used as input data for PEC -determination 
in the soil compartment. The procedures for this are described in TGD PEC for SOIL 
compartment (depending on discharges via air and aquatic compartments.  40 Test Protocol for Emission Compound Toxicity  
  
For bioaccumulation testing, see Footnote6
 . 
 
PART 2G – Hazard assessment for provisional risk evaluation  
 A final hazard assessment will include the combinat ion of the data from provisional 
hazard assessment (1 D-1 - 1D-3) with the data from health an d environmental 
testing (see 1A and 1B ).  
 
2G-1: Health hazard and p rovisional risk  evaluation  
 
As part of a risk assessment each flue gas compound should be classified according 
to the GESAMP -EHS classification system (Table 1). Ranking will be used for long -
term exposure based on the following hazards: carcinogenicity (C), mutagenicity (M), 
reproductive effects (R), sensitization, primarily by inhalation (S) (see 1D -1).  
 Data should then be used for determination of a non -threshold and /or worst case 
approach should be a used as part of a provisional risk evaluation (1D -2).  
  
2G-2: Environmental hazard evaluation  
 Final hazard assessment should be u sed to determine the PNEC of the compound 
based on data from the most sensitive test organism.  The PNEC should be determined based on acute or chronic toxicity test(s) with the assessment factors described in Table 2  (1D-3).  
                                                 
6 Experiences have shown that flue gas components all exhibit low bioaccumulation potentials.  Testing 
for bioaccumulation potentials and for bioconcentration in biological tissue is not regarded necessary

 B.2 Basis for sampling  
 
The basis for the sampling strategy is to collect cleaned gas removed from the absorber and use these samples for selected toxicity tests. This will require manual sampling combined with one or more methods for sample conservation before toxicity testing.  
 The strategy for isokinetic sampling has been described in a separate report in TQP Amine 1 (Wittgens, 2010), and only a brief background will be given here.  
 As stated in the ITT the sampling method should be able to collect representative emission extr acts containing gaseous, liquid phases and aerosols/particulates. The 
complete emission (including entrained droplets and evaporated substances) and compound groups of interest are primarily amines, ammonia, aldehydes, amides, alkylamines, nitrosamines and  nitramines, with specific focus on alkylamines, 
nitrosamines and nitramines. Due to low concentrations of these compounds, large sampling volumes me be needed.  
 
B3 Standardised methods for manual sampling  
 Standardised methods for manual sampling have bee n described in a separate report 
submitted in TQP Amine 1 (Wittgens, 2010). In brief, this report describes the background for sampling from stationary sources, the design of a representative measurement location, and a generic design for measurement site.  As a background 
for the report, some essential issues in the report are summarised here.  
 In order to collect representative samples these are taken at ambient temperature (see Table B.1). Sample collections can be performed in a series of generally cooled impingers, and different component groups are collected by appropriate absorbents (acids, solvents) or absorbing tubes for further processes. For toxicity testing we may expect to include large sampling volumes, and absorbents cannot be used since non-destructed samples are needed for toxicity tests. Adsorbents may be used if non-
destructive desorption is possible without affecting original toxicity of the flue gas samples.  
 Flue gases in a stack may be inhomogeneous due to stratification or swirling caus ed 
by duct design and geometry (Figure B.1). Therefore average concentrations and velocities at several evenly spaced measurement points across a measurement plane need to be determined, performed as grid measurements over a measurement plane (see Figure B .2) and several measurement planes used (Figure B.3).  
 Since the flue gas is inhomogeneous it is necessary to remove the sample stream isokinetically, i.e. with the same velocity as the main stream in the duct (Figure B.4). If the main stream velocity is h igher than in the sampling probe (w>v) sample 
concentrations may be lower than in the main stream, while a probe velocity higher than the main stream velocity (w<v) may result in too high sample concentrations in the probe (Figure B.4).

of mass concentration, velocity and mass flow density (reference 
DIN EN 15259.)

Sampling material should be designed in corrosion resistant material. Possible 
corrosion may be caused by amines, organic acids from amine degradation, SO 2, CO 2 
and NH 3. Material could be stainless steel, PTFE or rubber -coated steel.  
B.4 Recovery and analyses  
A number of analyses must be conducted prior to sampling and of the samples. Some of the relevant analyses and relevant validated methods are shown in Table B.2. Of specific interest is the analyses of potential hazardous compounds, which primarily are con sidered to organic compounds. However, it is important also to overview 
methods for sampling, and dust and metals are often included as part of stationary flue gas emission sampling regime.  
 For particle/dust sampling the dust in a gas sample collected with isokinetically flow -
rate and measured volume is separated by a pre -weighed plane filter system, which is 
then dried and re -weighed. The filtering device can be placed inside or outside the 
duct (Figure B.5). The filters should be able to collect > 99.5 % of test aerosols with mean particle diameters of 0.3 µm. For most cases quartz fibre or PTFE filters have proven efficient. However, quartz fibre filters may have weak mechanical characteristics, while PTFE filters should not be exposed to temperatures a bove 
230°C (EN 13284- 1: 2002).  
 For heavy metal analyses flue gas should be isokinetically sampled, with dust collected in a filter (preferably PTFE), and the gas stream should then passed through a series of absorbers with absorption solutions. Both filt ers and absorption solutions 
are used for analyses (Figure B.6). Typical absorption system includes a series of three absorbers with solution of nitric acid/hydrogen peroxide, while filters are digested by a mixture of hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid (EN  14385:2004). Analyses 
are typically performed as AAS, ICP -OES or ICP -MS). Sampling and recovery 
should be performed so a detection limit of 1 µg/m
3 for individual elements is 
achieved.  Field evaluations showed that absorption efficiencies for different e lements 
were between 39 and 91 % (EN 14385:2004).   
 For sampling of organic components in flue gas a number of validated methods are available (Table B.2).   The standards EN 1948, parts 1 to 3 describe sampling, extraction/recovery and analyses of polych lorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and 
polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs).  The samples collected isokinetically 
adsorbed or on particles are collected in a sampling train. There is a choice between 
three different test systems:  
1) A filter/condenser met hod with an in- stack filter (e.g. quartz wool filter), with a 
downstream condenser (gas cooled down to < 20°C) and/or a solid adsorber.  2) A dilution system where the gas is collected with a heated probe, cooled rapidly down (< 40°C) with dry filtered air , and after air dilution PCDDs/PCDFs collected as 
particulates on filters, while gaseous PCDDs/PCDFs are collected on solid adsorbents.  
3) Cooled probe method in which the sample passes a water -cooled probe (< 20°C) 
and the condensate is collected in a co ndensate flask, while filters and impingers 
and/or solid adsorbents and filters are used for collecting small particles, breaking aerosols and collecting gaseous PCDDs/PCDFs. The methods are shown schematically in Figure B.7).  Typical filters used are qua rtz/quartz wool or glass 
fibre, while recommended solid adsorbers include XAD -2, polyurethane foam, or 
Porepak PS (EN -1948- 1: 2006).

Sampling and analyses of gas and particle -phase PAH are described in the ISO 
standards 11338- 1 and 11338- 2. Sampling may be performed isokinetically by one of 
three methods regarded as equivalent:  1) Dilution method, 2) the heated filter/condenser/adsorber method, and 3) the cooled probe/adsorber method. These are the same methods as described f or the PCDDs/PCDFs sampling methods above (EN 
1948- 1: 2006), and as shown schematically in Figure B.7. The methods are suitable 
for different flue gas characteristics as shown in Table B.3. Typical filter units for particle trapping are glass fibre, quartz  wool cartridge or cyclone, while adsorber 
materials are polyurethane foam and/or XAD -2

 The standard methods VDI 3862 consist of a series of 7 Guidelines for sampling and analyses of aldehydes, ether as total aldehydes /ketones or as individual components. Part 1 gives instructions for measurements of short -chain aldehydes by 3 -methyl- 2-
benzothiazolinone hydrazone (MBTH) for total aldehyde determination. This method is particularly suitable for measurements of formaldehyde emissions. Parts 2 and 3 present methods for aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes and ketones to be measured as individual com ponents. The substances are converted to corresponding hydrozones in 
impingers or cartridges with 2,4 -nitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH), and the components 
can be directly analysed by HPLC -methods. Part 4 describes a formaldehyde 
determination method, in which f ormaldehyde is converted in an alkaline medium 
(AHMT). Part 5 describes a specific method for determination of lower aldehydes, where the components are converted to corresponding oxazolidines i tubes with 2-(hydroximethyl) piperidine (2 -HMP) on fixed sorption material. After desorption 
(toluene), individual components are analysed by GC. Part 6 presents a acetylacetone method for formaldehyde determination in exhausts gas by wet -chemical photometric 
or fluorometric analyses. Part 7 describes a method to measure aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes and ketones individually, where the substances are converted to corresponding hydrozones in impingers with a hydrochloric DNPH solution.  
In summary, all standard methods described above required some destructive methods for trapping of target analytes. A summary of these methods are shown in Table 5.4. Particulate compounds trapped on filters are subsequently destructed with acid for metal analyses. Filter materials and solid sorbents used for sampling organic compone nts are extracted in solvents for concentration and analyses of organic 
components (e.g. diethylether/n- hexane or other solvents).  Condensates are extracted 
with n -hexane. Samples are then concentrated before analyses (e.g. ISO11338 -
2:2003).  Alternativel y components in flue gas samples may be specifically converted 
to target analytes which can be directly analysed to high specificity (e.g. VDI 3862).  Additional methods of relevance for analyses of target components from absorber flue gas include sampling  for analyses of amines, ammonia, amides, alkylamines, 
nitrosamines and amines. All compound groups required the use of absorbants or solid adsorbents with subsequent solvent desorption (Table 5.4).

 B.5  Analytical and preparative sampling of volatile amines in a cold trap – A 
concept study  
 
Background  
The normal function of a cold trap mounted first in a sampling train is to remove 
water from the sampled flue gas before adsorption on a sampling tube. It has been observed that a volatile nitrosamine (NDMA) is trapped together with water in a cold trap. 
  
Idea  
The idea is that water soluble compounds will follow water in the trapping process on a cold trap. If correct, this principle can be used to develop an analytical and a preparative sampling procedure for other water -soluble and volatile compounds. Cold 
trap sampling will allow for sampling without a sampling medium like acidic absorption solutions or solid sampl ing tubes that eventually will interfere with the 
sample or experiments that are going to be performed with the sample. Thus, a clean and undiluted sample will result that easily can be stored at liquid nitrogen for subsequent analysis and/or experiments.   
Aim of study  
The aim of the study was to verify that the concept will work and to get rough preliminary data on the trapping ratio of compounds . These data will be very useful 
for the further work in H&ETQP Amine 1, Subtask 2 and H&ETQP Amine 3, Activity  01. The volatile compounds studied was ammonia and the alkylamines; 
methylamine, ethylamine and dimethylamine. All these compounds are relevant in flue gas sampling.  
  
Experimental  
The test mixture consisted of 1 mg/mL of ammonia and 10 ug/mL of each of t he 
alkylamines methylamine, ethylamine and dimethylamine. Cold trapping was performed in an empty gas washing bottle at minus 20 and minus 75. A midget impinger with 20 mL 0.1 N H2SO4 absorption solution was mounted behind the cold trap in the sampling tra in. The concentrations of amines were analyzed in the water 
trapped in the cold trap and in the absorption solution by GC -MS after derivatization. 
The total amounts of amines were calculated in the trapped water and the absorption solution.  
  
Results  
The r esults from experiments performed at minus 20 and minus 70 ºC are shown in 
the Table B.5 . Results are given as percentage of total amount of amine trapped by the 
cold trap and by the absorption solution.  
     Table B.5 -1 Experiment performed at minus 20 ºC: 
 
Analyte  Amount in cold trap  
(percent)  Amount i adsorption

Ammonia  16 84 
Methylamine  60 40

Ammonia  71 29 
Methylamine  92 8 
Ethylamine  85 15 
Dimethylamine  92 8 
    
Conclusions  
The main conclusions are that: 1) the most volatile amines (ammonia and alkylamines) can be trapped by the cold trap, 2) alkylamines are trapped more efficiently than ammonia, and 3) the trapping ratio of compounds for the cold trap is increased with lower ed temperature.       
 The experiment has given the information that was missing both for TQP ID 1 and 3.

NTNU carefully investigated the sensitization effects of amine 3 chemicals. For sensitization, results from 
individual studies from RTECS  were categorized into inhalation and percutaneous studies. For IUCLID, 
studies were divided into four broad categories: Invalid, sensitizing, non -sensitizing and ambiguous; with 
type of species bein g included as a subcategory. The different categorization for RTECS and IUCLID was 
done since RTECS provides studies which are positive only according to their criteria.

Amin  MEA  141-43-5 RTECS has classified  it as reprotoxic (R). Studies 
from IUCLID c onfirm maternal effects and 
developmental effects in some studies but not all.  
From the above studies we concluded that it has 
slight maternal toxicity but no fetotoxic or 
developmental toxicity. We therefore con clude 
that it is as no R and recommend no further 
testing.  
NH3  NH3  7664- 41-
7 RTECS indicated that there is a lack of reproductive 
and developmental toxicology studies for this 
chemical. In addition, IUCLID states that no 
guideline test assessing teratology or reproductive 
effects in laboratory animals has been reported. 
We therefore conclude that there is lack of 
reproduction toxicity studies and limited data. 
However, since it is a common chemical, we 
recommend no further testing.  
Aldehy des Form aldehyde  50-00-0 RTECS classified it as R. Several studies in IUCLID 
indicated fetotoxicity but no statistically significant 
teratogenic effects. We therefore conclude that it has m ainly fetotoxic effects but may exhibit 
maternal and developmental toxicity  as well. We 
recommend no further testing if considered as a 
confirmed R.  
 Acetaldehyde  75-07-0 RTECS classfied it as R. Stuides from IUCLID 
indicate no paternal toxicity studies. However, 
teratogenic and developmental effects are 
reported. We therefore conclude that it has m ainly 
fetotoxic and developmental effects  and confirm it 
as R. We therefore recommend no further testing.  Appendix C_Final doc.docx  11 Amides  Acetamide  60-35-5 RTECS data reported post- implantation mortality, 
specific developmental abnormalities in 
musculoskeletal system and fetotoxicity. IUCLID 
did not provide any chemical data sheet. We 
therefore concluded that there is lack of data on 
parental toxicity but studies indicate fetotoxic and 
developmental toxic effect. We therefore confirm 
it as R and recommend no further testing.  
Alkylamines  Methylamine  74-89-5 No reprotox data from RTECS. IUCLID studies on 
reproduction, developmental and teratogenecity 
showed negative results on these parameters. We 
therefore confirm it as no R and recommend n o 
further testing.  
 Dimethylamine  124-40-3 No reprotox study is reported by RTECS. In IUCLID several studies indicating no developmental

ENDPOINT:  Acute oral toxicity  
 
TEST METHOD NAME: Up and Down Procedure (UDP)  
 
ENPOINT PARAMETER:  Signs of toxicity and Mortality  
 
REFERENCE: OECD 425  
 
VALIDATION STATUS:  YES OECD 
 
IN VIVO / IN VITRO TEST METHOD:  In  Vivo  
 
EXPOSURE ROUTE(S):  Oral (S ingle dose by gavage). If single dose is not possible: smaller fractions within 24 hours.  
 
ANIMAL / CELL CULTURE INFORMATION: Female Rats (8 and 12 weeks old)  
 
NO. ANIMAL GENERATIONS TESTED: NA 
 
TEST DURATION: 48 hrs to 14 days  
 
INSTRUMENT REQUIREMENTS (EXPOSURE, MEASUREMENTS ETC.): Weighing balance for weight measurement, Microscope for 
gross pathology  
 
TEST PRINCIPLES: Acute oral toxicity refers to adverse effects occurring following oral administration of a single dose of a substance, or 
multiple doses given within 24 hours.  
 
BRIEF TEST DESCRIPTION:  
The test is divided into two parts:  
a) Limit Test: It is a sequential test with 5 animals; performed when the test material is likely to be non toxic. Dose one anim al at the 
test dose (2000/5000 mg/Kg).  
Animal Dies: Conduct the main test to determine the LD50.  
Animal Survives: Dose four addit ional animals sequentially so that a total of five animals are 
tested. (O=survival, X=death).  
If 3 animals X, limit test – terminated; main test -  performed.  
The LD50 ≥ 2000/5000 mg/kg if ≥ 3 animal survival (OOOOO; OOOXO; OOOOX; OOOXX; 
OXOXO; OXOOO; OOXXO; OOXOO; OXXOO  
The LD50 is ≤ 2000/5000 mg/kg if ≥ 3 animals die (OXOXX; OOXXX; OXXOX; OXXX)   
 
b) Main Test: For each run, animals are dosed  in a single ordered dose progression , one at a 
time, at 48 hrs. interval. The first animal is dosed a step below the level of the best estimate of 
LD50.  
Upon survival/death: Dose for the next animal is increased/decreased by a progression factor of 
3.2 times the original dose. The dose progression factor is the antilog of 1/(the estimated slope of 
the dose -response curve) (for e.g. a progression of 3.2 corresponds to a slope of 2). If no Appendix D_TEST METHOD EVALUATION_Humtox_pk_md.docx 2 information on the slope of the substance to be tested, a dose progression factor of 3.2 is used 
which gives a dose sequence of 1.75, 5.5, 17.5, 55, 175, 550, 2000 (or 1.75, 5.5, 17.5, 55, 175, 
550, 1750, 5000 for specific regulatory needs). If no estimate of the substance’s lethality is 
available, dosing should be initiated at 175 mg/kg.  
The main test is stopped when one of the stopping criteria is met.  
a) 3 consecutive animals surviv e at the upper bound;  
b) 5 reversals occur in any 6 consecutive animals tested;  
c) at least 4 animals have followed the first reversal and the specified likelihood -ratios exceed 
the critical value.  
 
Results of the main test procedure serve as the starting point  for a computational procedure for calculation of LD50 and a confidence 
interval.  
 
Interval between treatment groups: Usually at 48 hr interval or determined by the onset, duration, and severity of toxic sign s.   
 
Observation: At least once during the first 30 minutes, periodically during the first 24 hours, with special attention given during the first 4 
hours, and daily thereafter, for a total of 14 days.  
 
SPECIFIC PRECAUTIONS: M aximum dose volume for administration: 1mL/100g of body weight or 2 mL/1 00g body weight for aqueous 
solutions.  
Fasting before dose administration: Rats -overnight; Mice - 3-4 hrs  
Fasting after dose administration: Rats - 3-4 hrs; Mice - 1-2 hrs  
 
CRITERIA FOR HAZARD EVALUATION CLASSIFICATION:  Mortality or moribund animals; nature , severity and duration of toxic 
effects (such as changes in skin and fur, eyes and mucous membranes, respiratory, circulatory, autonomic and central nervous systems, 
somatomotor activity and behaviour pattern. Observations of tremors, convulsions, salivat ion, diarrhoea, lethargy, sleep and coma).

IN VIVO / IN VITRO TEST METHOD:  In vitro 
 
EXPOSURE ROUTE(S):  An appropriate minimal agar (e.g. containing Vogel -Bonner minimal 
medium E and glucose) and an overlay agar containing histidine and biotin or tryptophan, to allow for 
a few cell divisions, is used . 
 
ANIMAL / CELL CULTURE INFORMATION: Salmonella typhimurium: TA98, TA100, TA1535, 
TA1537, or TA1538. Host -mediated assay

TEST DURATION:   
All plates in a given assay should be incubated at 37°C for 48- 72 hours. After the incubation period, 
the number of revertant colonies per plate is counted.  
 
INSTRUMENT REQUIREMENTS (EXPOSURE, MEASUREMENTS ETC.):  
 
TEST PRINCIPLES: Suspensions of bacterial cells are exposed to the test subst ance in the presence 
and in the absence of an exogenous metabolic activation system. The suspensions are mixed with an 
overlay agar and plated immediat ely onto minimal medium. The  treatment mixture is incubated and 
then mi xed with an overlay agar before plating onto minimal medium. For both techniques, after two 
or three days of incubation, revertant  colonies are counted and compared to the number of 
spontaneous revertant colonies on solvent  control plates.  
 
 
BRIEF TEST DESCRIPTION:   Suspensions of bacterial cells are exposed to the test  subst ance in the 
presence and in the absence of an exogenous metabolic activation system. In the pl ate incorporation 
method, these suspensions are mixed with an overlay agar and plated immediat ely onto minimal 
medium. In the preincubation method, the trea tment mixture is incubated and then mi xed with an 
overlay agar before plating onto minimal medium. For both techniques, after two or thre e days of 
incubation, revertant colonies are counted and compared to the number of spontaneous revertant 
colonies on so lvent control plates.  
 
 
SPECIFIC PRECAUTIONS: It is recognised that certain classes of  
mutagens are not always detected using standard procedures such as the plate incorporation method  
or preincubation method. These should be regarded as "special cases" and it is strongly  
recommended that alternative procedures should be used for their detection. The following "special  Appendix D_TEST METHOD EVALUATION_Humtox_pk_md.docx 4 cases" could be identified (together with examples of procedures that could be used for their  
detection): azo- dyes and diazo compounds , gases and volatile chemicals, and glycosides . A deviation 
from the standard procedure needs to be  scientifically justified.

ANIMAL / CELL CULTURE INFORMATION: Bone marrow of rodents or mice is recommended, 
but other appropriate mammals may also be used  
 
NO. ANIMAL GENERATIONS TESTED:  
 
TEST DURATION:  With one single treatment of test substance: Samples of bone marrow are taken 
between 24 and 48 hours after treatment. Samples of peripheral blood are taken between 36 and 72 
hours. If 2 or more daily treatments, samples should be collected once between 18  and 24 hours 
following the final treatment for the bone marrow and once between 36 and 48 hours following the 
final treatment for the peripheral blood.  
 
INSTRUMENT REQUIREMENTS (EXPOSURE, MEASUREMENTS ETC.):  
 
TEST PRINCIPLES: Animals are exposed to the  test substance by an appropriate route. If bone 
marrow is used, the animals are sacrificed at appropriate times after treatment, the bone marrow 
extracted, and preparations made and stained. When peripheral blood is used, the blood is collected at 
appropr iate times after treatment and smear preparations are made and stained. For studies with 
peripheral blood, as little time as possible should elapse between the last exposure and cell harvest. Preparations are analyzed for the presence of micronuclei.  
 
 
BRIEF TEST DESCRIPTION:   The mammalian in vivo micronucleus test is used for the detection of 
damage induced by the test substance to the chromosomes or the mitotic apparatus of erythroblasts, by analysis of erythrocytes as sampled in bone marrow and/or peri pheral blood cells of animals, 
usually rodents (mice or rats).  
The purpose of the micronucleus test is to identify substances (liquid or solid) that cause cytogenetic 
damage which results in the formation of micronuclei containing lagging chromosome fragm ents or 
whole chromosomes. An increase in the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in 
treated animals is an indication of induced chromosome damage. Animals are exposed to the test 
substance by an appropriate route (usually by gavage using a stomach tube or a suitable intubation 
cannula, or by intraperitoneal injection). Bone marrow and/or blood cells are collected, prepared and Appendix D_TEST METHOD EVALUATION_Humtox_pk_md.docx 8 stained. Preparations are analyzed for the presence of micronuclei. Each treated and control group 
must include at least 5 analysable animals per sex. Administration of the treatments consists of a 
single dose of test substance or two daily doses (or more). The limit dose is 2000 mg/kg/body 
weight/day for treatment up to 14 days, and 1000 mg/kg/body weight/day for t reatment longer than 
14 days. 
 
 
SPECIFIC PRECAUTIONS: If there is evidence that the test substance, or a reactive metabolite, will 
not reach the target  tissue, it is not appropriate to use this test.  Weight variation of animals should be 
minimal and not e xceed ± 20% of the mean weight of each sex.

TEST PRINCIPLES: The objective is to detect possible  mammalian mutagens an d carcinogens  
induced by chemical substances.  
 
BRIEF TEST DESCRIPTION:   Mammalian cells in suspension or monolayer culture are exposed to, 
at least four analysable concentrations of the test substance, both with and without metabolic 
activation, for a suitable period of time. The y are subcultured to determine cytotoxicity and to allow 
phenotypic expression prior to mutant selection. It is recommended to utilise at least 106cells. 
Cytotoxicity is usually determined by measuring the relative cloning efficiency (survival) or relative  
total growth of the cultures after the treatment period. The treated cultures are maintained in growth medium for a sufficient period of time, characteristic of each selected locus and cell type, to allow 
near-optimal phenotypic expression of induced muta tions. Mutant frequency is determined by seeding 
known numbers of cells in medium containing the selective agent to detect mutant cells, and in 
medium without selective agent to determine the cloning efficiency (viability). After a suitable 
incubation time , colonies are counted.  
 
SPECIFIC PRECAUTIONS: Care should be taken to avoid conditions which would lead to  
results not reflecting intrinsic mutagenicity. Positive results which do not reflect intrinsic  
mutagenicity may arise from changes in pH, osmolality or high levels of cytotoxicity .

TEST PRINCIPLES:  
This is a genotoxicity test for the detection of micronuclei in the cytoplasm of interphase cells. 
Micronuclei may originate from acentric chromosome fragments (i.e. lacking a centromere), or whole 
chromosomes that are unable to migrate to the poles during the anaph ase stage of cell division. The 
assay detects the activity of clastogenic and aneugenic test substances in cells that have undergone 
cell division during or after exposure to the test substance.  
 
BRIEF TEST DESCRIPTION : 
Cell cultures of human or mammalian origin are exposed to the test substance both with and without an exogenous source of metabolic activation unless cells with an adequate metabolizing capability are 
used. Concurrent solvent/vehicle and positive controls are included in all tests.  
 
During or after exposure to the test substance, the cells are grown for a period sufficient to allow 
chromosome or spindle damage to lead to the formation of micronuclei in interphase cells. For 
induction of aneuploidy, the tes t substance should ordinarily be present during mitosis. Harvested and 
stained interphase cells are analysed for the presence of micronuclei. Ideally, micronuclei should only 
be scored in those cells that have completed mitosis during exposure to the test substance or during 
the post -exposure period, if one is used. In cultures that have been treated with a cytokinesis blocker, 
this is achieved by scoring only binucleate cells. In the absence of a cytokinesis blocker, it is Appendix D_TEST METHOD EVALUATION_Humtox_pk_md.docx 14 important to demonstrate that the  cells analysed are likely to have undergone cell division during or 
after exposure to the test substance.  
 
SPECIFIC PRECAUTIONS: It  is important to demonstrate that cell proliferation has occurred in 
both the control and treated cultures, and the extent of test substance- induced cytotoxicity or 
cytostasis should be assessed in the cultures (or in parallel cultures) that are scored for micronuclei.

ENDPOINT:  Chronic toxicity / Carcinogenicity  
 
TEST METHOD NAME: Combined Chronic Toxicity / Carcinogenicity Studies  
 
ENPOINT PARAMETER:  General:  Suvival data, body weight / changes, food consumption, 
toxicokinetic data, opthalmosc opy, haematology, clinical chemistry. Clinical findings : signs of 
toxicity, incidence of any abnormality, nature, severity and duration of clinical obersvation. Necropsy 
data:  Terminal body weight, organ weights and their ratios, necropsy findings – incide nce and 
severity of abnormalities. Histopathology
 : Non neoplastic histopathological findings, neoplastic 
histopathological findings, correlation between gross and microscopic findings, detailed description 
of all treatment -related histopathological finding s including severity gradings, report of any peer 
review of slides.  
 
REFERENCE: OECD TG 453  
 
VALIDATION STATUS:  OECD validated  
 
IN VIVO / IN VITRO TEST METHOD: In vivo  
 
EXPOSURE ROUTE(S):  Focus on oral route. Dermal or inhalation need careful modifications   
 
ANIMAL / CELL CULTURE INFORMATION: Primarily rodent species, by use of other species, 
appropriate modifications must be taken (OECD Guidance  Document  No 116)  
 
NO. ANIMAL GENERATIONS TESTED:  
 
TEST DURATION:  Chronic phase : Normally 12 months, can be shorter (e.g.6 or 9) and longer (e.g. 
18 or 24). Deviations from 12 months must be justified. Carcinogenicity phase:
  Normally 24 months  
INSTRUMENT REQUIREMENTS (EXPOSURE, MEASUREMENTS ETC.):  
 
TEST PRINCIPLES: The objective of a combined chr onic toxicity/carcinogenicity study is to 
identify carcinogenic and the majority of chronic effects, and to determine dose- response 
relationships following prolonged and repeated exposure.  
 
 
BRIEF TEST DESCRIPTION:   The rat is typically used for this study. For rodents, each dose group 
and concurrent control group intended for the carcinogenicity phase of the study should contain at 
least 50 animals of each sex, while for the chronic toxicity phase of the study should contain at least 
10 animals of each sex.  At least three dose levels should be used, in addition to the concurrent 
control group for both the chronic toxicity phase and the carcinogenicity phase of the study. For 
chronic phase, the test substance is admin istered daily in graduated doses to several groups of test 
animals, one dose level per group. For carcinogenicity, phase, the test substance is administered daily to several groups of test animals for a major portion of their life span.  
 The observations permit the detection of neoplastic effects and a determination of carcinogenic 
potential as well as the general toxicity.  
 
The three main routes of administration are oral, dermal, and inhalation. The Test Guideline focuses Appendix D_TEST METHOD EVALUATION_Humtox_pk_md.docx 16 on the oral route of administrat ion. 
 
SPECIFIC PRECAUTIONS: Both sexes should be used. A sufficient number of animals should be 
used to have a throughout biological and statistical evaluation (e.g. for rodent – 50 animals of each 
sex)

 TEST DURATION:  54 days  
 INSTRUMENT REQUIREMENTS (EXPOSURE, MEASUREMENTS ETC.): Microscope, Weighing machine  
 TEST PRINCIPLES: The study will provide evaluations of reproduction/developmental toxicity 
associated with administration of repeated doses. In particular, since emphasis is placed on both 
general toxicity and reproduction/developmental toxicity endpoints, the results of the study will 
allow for the discrimination between reproduction/developmental effects occurring in the absence of general toxicity and those which are only expressed at levels that are also toxic to parent animals. It could provide an indication of the nee d to conduct further investigations and could provide 
guidance in the design of subsequent studies.  
 BRIEF TEST DESCRIPTION:    
The test substance is administered in graduated doses to at least 3 test groups and a control group 
of males (at least 4 weeks)  and females (approximately 54 days). Dosing is done based on 
information from any existing toxicity and toxicokinetic data in 10 animals/ group/ sex. The highest 
dose level - inducing toxic effects but not death or severe suffering. Thereafter, a descendin g 
sequence of dose levels dosage related response and no -observed -adverse effects (NOAEL) at the 
lowest dose level. Two to four fold intervals between dosages is used. If in the limit test, no 
observable toxic effects are observed at 1000mg/Kg/b.w/day , th en a full study using several dose Appendix D_TEST METHOD EVALUATION_Humtox_pk_md.docx 22 levels is not necessary.  
Mating is done at full sexual maturity (Sprague Dawley rats 10 weeks, Wistar rats -12 weeks) at 1:1 
ratio. No. of pregnant females: 8/ group.

ENDPOINT: Acute toxicity, inhibition of growth  
 TEST METHOD NAME: Freshwater Algae and Cyanobacteria, Growth Inhibition Test  
 ENPOINT PARAMETER: ECx (e.g. EC50) and/or LOEC and NOEC.  
 REFERENCE: OECD guidelines for the testing of chemicals 201, adopted 23 March 2006  
 VALIDATION STATUS: This guideline is based on OECD guideline 201 (rev. 1984), ISO 8692 (1993), ISO/DIS 14442 (1998), ISO 5667 -16 (1998), extensive practical experience, scientific 
progress in the field of algal toxicity studies, and extensive regulatory use  
 IN VIVO / IN VITRO TEST METHOD: In vivo  
 EXPOSURE ROUTE(S): Surface  
 EXPOSURE VOLUME(S): Variable, depending on test design and measurement instruments. The test vessels must be of dimensions that allow a sufficient volume of culture for analytical 
determinations and a sufficient mass transfer of CO2 from the atmosphere.  
 ANIMAL / CELL CULTURE INFORMATION (INCLUDING NO. ANIMALS/CELL CULTURE CONC.):  Several species of non -attached microalgae (e.g . Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) and 
cyanobacteria may be used. Examples of suitable strains are given in the guideline  
 
NO. GENERATION OF ORGANISM TESTED: Effects over several generations can be assessed.  
 
TEST DURATION:  Normally 72 hours. Shorter or longer test durations may be used if validity criteria are met.  
 INSTRUMENT REQUIREMENTS (EXPOSURE, MEASUREMENTS ETC.): Culturing vessels/flasks, 
culturing apparatus, temperature and light measurement instruments, apparatus to determine algal biomass ( electronic particle counter, a microscope with counting chamber, 
flow cytometer, fluorimeter, spectrophotometer or colorimeter), etc.  
 TEST PRINCIPLES AND BRIEF METHOD DESCRIPTION  
The purpose of this test is to determine the effects of a substance on the growth of freshwater microalgae and/or cyanobacteria. For full expression of the system response to toxic effects (optimal sensitivity), the cultures are allowed unrestricted exponential growth under nutrient sufficient conditions and continuous light for a sufficient period of time to 
measure reduction of the specific growth rate.  
 Appendix E_TEST METHOD EVALUATION_Ecotox_shv.docx    12/10/2010  Page 2 of 13 pages  Based on results from a range -finding test, a final definitive test with at least five different  
concentrations of the test solution, arranged in a geometric series with a fac tor not 
exceeding 3,2 is prepared. The test design should include three replicates at each test 
concentration. An inoculum culture of exponentially growing test organisms is added to each test vessel,  and exposed to the test substance over a period of norm ally 72 hours . Algal 
biomass (often measured by surrogate parameters like cell volume, fluo rescence, optical 
density, etc.) in each test vessel is determined at least daily during the test period.   
 The system response is the reduction of growth in a series of algal cultures (test units) exposed to various concentrations of a test substance.  Growth and growth inhibition are 
quantified from measurements of the algal biomass  as a function of time, and the response 
is then evaluated as a function of the e xposure concentration in comparison with the 
average growth of  unexposed control cultures. Growth is expressed as the logarithmic 
increase in biomass (average specific growth rate) during the exposure period. From the 
average specific growth rates recorded  in a series of test solutions, the concentration 
bringing about a specified x % inhibition of growth rate (e.g. 50%)  that is determined and 
expressed as the ECx (e.g. EC50). Also , the lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) and 
the no observed effect concentration (NOEC) may be statistically determined.  
 
HSE CONSIDERATIONS: Reference and test substances should be handles according to MSDS  
 CRITERIA FOR VALIDITY AND  HAZARD EVALUATION CLASSIFICATION:  
For the test to be valid, the following performance criteria should be met:  
• The biomass in the control cultures should have increased exponentially by a factor of at least 16 within the 72 -hour test period.  
• The mean coefficient of variation for section -by-section specific growth rates (days 0 -1, 
1-2 and 2 -3, for 72 -hour tests) in the control cultures must not exceed 35%  
• The coefficient of variation of average specific growth rates during the whole test 
period in replicate control cultures must not exceed certain strain specific limits.  
• The pH of the control medium should not increase by more than 1.5 units during the 
test.  
When possible, the 95% confidence limits for each estimate should be determined. It is 
desirable to test a reference substance like 3,5 -dichlorophenol used in the international  
ring test, or potassium dichromate for green algae, at least twice a year.  
 SUITABILITY EXPOSURE OF AIR SAMPLES:  No. This guideline is most easily applied to water-
soluble substances. For testing of substances that are volatile, strongly adsorbing, colou red, 
having a low solubility in water or substances that may affect the availability of nutrients or minerals in the test medium, certain modifications of the described procedure may be required (e.g., closed system, conditioning of the test vessels).

 IN VIVO / IN VITRO TEST METHOD: In vivo  
 EXPOSURE ROUTE(S): Direct uptake across surface and oral  
 
EXPOSURE VOLUME(S): At least 2 ml of test solution should be provided for each animal (i.e. 
a volume of 10 ml for five daphnids  per test vessel)  
 
ANIMAL / CELL CULTURE INFORMATION (INCLUDING NO. ANIMALS/CELL CULTURE CONC.):  Preferred test species is Dapnhia magna Straus, but other Daphnia species can be used. In 
order to reduce variability, the animals should be less than 24 hou rs old, not be first brood 
progeny and derive from a healthy stock showing no signs of stress. All organisms used for a particular test should have originated from cultures established from the same stock of daphnids, maintained in culture conditions (light, temperature, and medium) similar to those to be used in the test.  
 NO. GENERATION OF ORGANISM TESTED: One  
 TEST DURATION: 48 hours  
 INSTRUMENT REQUIREMENTS (EXPOSURE, MEASUREMENTS ETC.): Oxygen -meter, pH -meter, temperature control, equipment for determination of total 
organic carbon concentration (TOC),  chemical oxygen demand (COD)and hardness, etc.  
 TEST PRINCIPLES AND BRIEF METHOD DESCRIPTION:  
Young daphnids  are exposed to the test substance at a range of concentrations for a period 
of 48 hours. At least five test concentrations should be used, arranged in a geometric series with a separation factor preferably not exceeding 2.2. Immobilisation is recorded at 24 hours and 48 hours and compared with control values. The results are analysed in order to calculate the EC50 at 48h. Determination of the EC50 at 24h is optional.  
 Appendix E_TEST METHOD EVALUATION_Ecotox_shv.docx    12/10/2010  Page 4 of 13 pages  As far as possible, the use of solvents, emulsifiers or dispersants should be avoided. A range -
finding test may be conducted to determine the range of concentrations for the definitive 
test unless information on toxicity of the test substance is available. Natural water (surface or ground water), reconstituted water or dechlorinated tap water  are acceptable as holding 
and dilution water if daphnids will survive in it for the duration of the culturing, acclimation and testing without showing signs of stress (high mortality, presence of males andephippia, delay in the production of the first bro od, discoloured animals, unusual behaviour such as 
trapping at surface of water etc).  
 Test vessels are filled with appropriate volumes of dilution water and solutions of test substance before daphnids are introduced. At least 20 animals, preferably divide d into four 
groups of five animals each, should be used at each test concentration and for the controls. The test may be carried out using semi- static renewal or flow -through system. The 
temperature should be within the range of 18 -  22°C, and a 16 -hour li ght and 8 -hour dark 
cycle is recommended . The pH should remain in the range 6 -9. The daphnids should not be 
fed during the test  
 Each test vessel should be checked for immobilised daphnids after 24 and 48 hours exposure. Those animals that are not able to swim within 15 seconds, after gentle agitation 
of the test vessel are considered to be immobilised, even if they can still move their antennae.  In addition, any abnormal behaviour or appearance should be reported. The 
dissolved oxygen and pH are measured at the beginning and end of the test in the control(s) 
and in the highest test substance concentration.  
 HSE CONSIDERATIONS: Reference and test substances should be handles according to MSDS  
 CRITERIA FOR VALIDITY ANDHAZ ARD EVALUATION CLASSIFICATION:  
For a test to be valid, the following performance criteria apply:  
- Not more than 10 % of the daphnids should show immobilisation or other signs of disease or stress in the controls.  
- The dissolved oxygen concentration at the e nd of the test should be ≥ 3 mg/l in 
control and test vessels.  
- EC50 is calculated with 95% confidence limits (p = 0.95).

 IN VIVO / IN VITRO TEST METHOD: In vivo  
 EXPOSURE ROUTE(S):  Directly through skin, gills , oral.  
 EXPOSURE VOLUME(S): Variable, depending on species and exposure tanks  
 ANIMAL / CELL CULTURE INFORMATION (INCLUDING NO. ANIMALS/CELL CULTURE CONC.):  One or  more species may be used, the choice being at the discretion of the testing 
laboratory. Examples of fish recommended for testing are given in the guideline.  The fish 
should be in good health and free from any apparent malformation, and  must be obtained 
and held in the laboratory at least 12 days before they  are used for testing. They must be 
held in water of the quality , temperature and photperiode  to be used in the test for at least 
seven days immediately before , and least  80%  O
2 of ASV. The fish should be fed three times 
per week or daily until 24 hours before the test is started. Following a 48 -hours settling -in 
period, mortalities are recorded and the following criteria applied:  
• greater than 10% of population in seven days: rejection  of entire batch  
• between 5 and 10% of population: acclimatisation continued for seven additional days  
• less than 5% of population:  acceptance of batch  
 NO. GENERATION OF ORGANISM TESTED: One  
 TEST DURATION: 96 hours  
 INSTRUMENT REQUIREMENTS (EXPOSURE, MEASUREMENTS ETC.): Oxygen meter, 
equipment for determination of water hardness, adequate temperature control, tanks made 
of chemically inert material and of a suitable capacity , etc.  
 TEST PRINCIPLES AND DESCRIPTION:  The fish are exposed to the test substance preferably for a period of 96 hours. Mortalities are recorded at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours and the concentration which kill 50% of the fish (LC50) are determined where possible.  Appendix E_TEST METHOD EVALUATION_Ecotox_shv.docx    12/10/2010  Page 6 of 13 pages  There should be at least five concentrations of the test substance in a geometric series with 
a factor preferably not exceeding 2.2. A range -finding test properly conducted before the 
definitive test enables the choice of the appropriate concentration range. Stock solutions of substances of low water solubility may be prepared by ultrasonic dispersion etc. If necessary, vehicles such as organic solvents, emulsifiers or dispersants of low toxicity to fish may be used. The test should be carried out without adjustment of pH.   
 At least 7 fish must be used at each test concentration and in the controls. There should be maximum loading of 1.0 g fish/litre for static and semi- static test. For flow -through systems 
higher loading can be accepted. The fish are inspected at least after 24, 48, 72 and 96 hour, when mortality and visible abnormalities are recorded. Fish are considered dead if there is no visible movement (e.g. gill movements) and if touching of the caudal peduncle produces no reaction. Visible abnormalities that should be recorded as los s of equilibrium, swimming 
behaviour, respiratory function, pigmentation, etc. Observations at three and six hours after 
the start of the test are desirable. Dead fish are removed when observed and mortalities are 
recorded. Measurement of pH, dissolved oxy gen and temperature should be carried out at 
least daily.  
 HSE CONSIDERATIONS: Reference and test substances should be handles according to MSDS  
 CRITERIA FOR VALIDITY AND HAZARD EVALUATION CLASSIFICATION:  
For a test to be valid the following conditions  should be fulfilled:  
• Mortality in the controls should not exceed 10 % (one fish if less than ten are used) at 
the end of the test  
• Constant conditions should be maintained as far as possible throughout the test. If necessary, semi- static or flow -through procedures should be used.  
• The dissolved oxygen concentration should be ≥60%of the air saturation value 
throughout the test.  
• There should be evidence that the concentration of the substance being tested has been satisfactorily maintained ( ≥80 % of the nomi nal concentration) over the test 
period. If the deviation is greater than 20%, results should be based on measured concentrations  
 
The cumulative percentage mortality for each exposure period is plotted against 
concentration. Normal statistical procedures are employed to calculate LC50 with 95% confidence limits (p=0,95). When data obtained are inadequate for the use of standard statistical methods, the highest concentration causing no mortality and the lowest concentration producing 100% mortality should b e used as an approximation for the LC50 .).

 TEST METHOD NAME: Earthworm, Acute Toxicity Test  
 ENPOINT PARAMETER: LC50  
 REFERENCE: OECD Guideline for Testing of Chemicals 207, adopted 4 April 1984  
 VALIDATION STATUS:OECD  
 IN VIVO / IN VITRO TEST METHOD: In vivo  
 EXPOSURE ROUTE(S): Direct contact, skin and oral  
 EXPOSURE VOLUME(S): No information  
 ANIMAL / CELL CULTURE INFORMATION (INCLUDING NO. ANIMALS/CELL CULTURE CONC.):  
The recommended test species of earthworm is Eisenia foetida. Although this is not a typical soil 
species, it occurs in soil rich in organic matter, and its susceptibility to chemicals resembles that of 
true soil- inhabiting species. Eisenia foetida  has a short life cycle, hatching from cocoons in 3 to 4 
weeks, and reaching maturity in seven to eight weeks at 20°C. It is very prolific, available 
commercially and can be bred readily in a wide range of organic waste materials. Eisenia foetida 
exists in two races which some taxonomists have separated into species. E. fo etida foetida, and E. 
foetida andre.  Other species may be used if the necessary methodology is available. Worms should 
be adult (at least two months old with clitellum) with an individual weight of 300 to 600 mg.  
 
NO. GENERATION OF ORGANISM TESTED: One  
 TEST DURATION: Filter paper test: 72 h. Artificial soil test: 14 days  
 INSTRUMENT REQUIREMENTS (EXPOSURE, MEASUREMENTS ETC.): Filter paper, artificial soil substrate, glass test containers , illuminated cabinet/chamber controllable to ± 2°C with a light intensity of 400 to 800 lux, other standard laboratory equipment.  
 TEST PRINCIPLES AND DESPRIPTION:  
This guideline includes two tests: a simple paper contact toxicity test (an optional initial screen test), 
and an artificial soil test that gives toxicity data more representative of natural.  
 
Filter paper test:  
The test substance is dissolved in water (if soluble up to a concentration of 1000 mg/l) or in a suitable 
organic solvent, to give a range of known concentrations. The solution is evaporated to dryness in a flat-bottomed glass vial lined with filter paper. Then, 1 ml of deionised water is added to each vial to 
moisten the filter paper. For each treatment, ten replicates, each consisting of one worm per vial, are Appendix E_TEST METHOD EVALUATION_Ecotox_shv.docx    12/10/2010  Page 8 of 13 pages  the minimum requirement. Tests are done in the dark at 20° and for a period of 48 hours with a 
further optional mortality assessment after 72 hours. Worms are classified as dead when they do not 
respond to a gentle mechanical stim ulus to the front end. Any behavioural or pathological symptoms 
should be reported.  
 
The artificial soil test:  
The artificial soil test involves keeping earthworms in samples of a precisely defined artificial soil to 
which a range of concentrations of the test substance has been applied. Normally, five 
concentrations in a geometric series, at a ratio of at most 2.0 . Mortality is assessed 7 and 14 days 
after application. One concentration resulting in no mortality and one resulting in total mortality should be used. A preliminary range -finding test is optional.  
 An emulsion or dispersion of the test substance in deio nised water (or a suitable organic solvent if 
insoluble in water) is mixed with artificial soil or sprayed evenly over it. For each test, 750 g weight of the test medium is placed into each glass container and ten conditioned earthworms are placed on 
the test medium surface. Four replicates for each treatment are recommended. The containers are 
covered with perforated plastic film to prevent the test medium from drying and kept under the test conditions, 20° in continuous light, for 14 days. The mortality is assessed by emptying test medium onto a glass tray or plate, sorting worms from the medium and testing their reaction to a mechanical stimulus at the front end. After the 7 -day assessment worms and medium are replaced in the test 
container. Any behaviour al or pathological symptoms should be reported. At the end of the test the 
moisture content of the test medium should be assessed. Mortality and concentration data should be reported, and the median lethal concentration (LC50) and its confidence limits est imated. 
 
 
HSE CONSIDERATIONS: Reference and test substance should be handled according to MSDS.  
 CRITERIA FOR HAZARD EVALUATION CLASSIFICATION:  
For either test to be valid, the mortality in the controls should not exceed 10% at the end of either 
test. Results should include LC50, highest concentration causing no mortality, lowest concentration causing 100% mortality, average live weight, descripti on of obvious physical or pathological 
symptoms or distinct changes in behaviour, moisture content of artificial soil at start and end and pH. 
LC50 of a reference substance should be determined occasionally as a means of assuring that the 
laboratory test c onditions are adequate and have not changed significantly.  
 
SUITABILITY EXPOSURE OF AIR SAMPLES: No. This Test Guideline can be used for substances 
that are either insoluble or soluble in water, although the method of application differs.

 EXPOSURE ROUTE(S): seed surface, roots  
 EXPOSURE VOLUME(S): Depending on the test design  
 ANIMAL / CELL CULTURE INFORMATION (INCLUDING NO. ANIMALS/CELL CULTURE CONC.):  The species selected should be reasonably broad, e.g., considering their ta xonomic diversity 
in the plant kingdom, distribution, abundance, species specific life -cycle characteristics and 
region of natural occurrence, to develop a range of responses. A list of characteristics of the possible test species that should be considered  in the selection, and some of the historically 
most used test species and potential non -crop species are summarized in this test guideline .  
 NO. GENERATION OF ORGANISM TESTED: One  
 TEST DURATION: 21 days, or more  
 INSTRUMENT REQUIREMENTS (EXPOSURE, MEASUREMENTS ETC.):  
Environment chambers, phytotrons, or greenhouses. Apparatus for measuring/monitoring temperature, light, humidity, carbon dioxide concentration etc.  
 TEST PRINCIPLES AND  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE METHOD:   
The test assesses effects on seedling emergence and early growth of higher plants following 
exposure to the test substance in the soil (or other suitable soil matrix), it does not cover chronic effects or effects on reproduction (i.e. seed set, flower formation, fruit maturation). The test can be conducted in order to determine the dose -response curve, or at a single 
concentration/rate as a limit test according to the aim of the study . 
 Appendix E_TEST METHOD EVALUATION_Ecotox_shv.docx    12/10/2010  Page 10 of 13 pages  The test conditions should approximate those conditions necessary for normal growth for 
the species and varieties tested. The emerging plants should be maintained under good 
horticultural practices in controlled growth facilities  (recording of temperature, humidity, 
carbon dioxide concentration, light (intensity, wave length, etc ) and light period, means  of 
watering, etc. ) to assure good plant growth as judged by the control plants of the selected 
species. Depending on the expected route of exposure and on physical properties as water 
solubility etc, the test substance is either incorporated into the soil  or applied to the soil 
surface.  Seeds of the same species are planted in pots. During the observation period, 
usually 14 to 21 days after 50% emergence of the seedlings in the control group, the plants are observed frequently (at least weekly and if possible daily) for emergence and visual phytotoxicity and mortality.  At the end of the test, measurement of percent emergence and 
biomass of surviving plants should be recorded, as well as visible detrimental effects on different parts of the plant. The latter  include abnormalities in appearance, e.g. stunted 
growth, chloris, discoloration, mortality, and effects on plant development. The final 
biomass can be measured using final average dry shoot weight of surviving plants, or 
alternatively fresh shoot weight.  The height of the shoot may be another endpoint. A 
uniform scoring system for visual injury should be used to evaluate the observable toxic responses.   
 HSE CONSIDERATIONS: Reference and test substances should be handles according to MSDS.  
 CRITERIA FOR HAZARD EVALUATION CLASSIFICATION:  
In order for the test to be valid, the following criteria must be met in the controls:  
• the seedling emergence is ≥ 70%  
• the seedlings do not exhibit visible phytotoxic effects (e.g. chlorosis, necrosis, wilting, leaf and st em deformations) and the plants exhibit only normal variation in growth and 
morphology for that particular species  
• the mean survival of emerged control seedlings is ≥ 90% for the duration of the study  
• environmental conditions for a particular species are id entical, growing media contain  
the same amount of soil matrix/ support media /substrate from the same source.  
 Recorded endpoints are subjected to statistical analysis to determine ECx or ERx  and their 
confidence limits. Where regression analysis, standard errors are required for the regression 
equation and individual parameter estimate. NOEC and LOEC can be calculated. A reference 
substance may be tested at regular intervals, to verify that p erformance of the test and the 
response of the particular test plants and the test conditions have not changed significantly over time.  
 SUITABILITY EXPOSURE OF AIR SAMPLES:  
No, this test  does not address plants exposed to vapours of chemicals.

ENDPOINT: Reproduction, number of living offspring per parent animal alive at termination.  
 TEST METHOD NAME: Daphnia magna Reproduction Test  
 ENPOINT PARAMETER: ECx, LOEC and/or NOEC.  
 REFERENCE: OECD Guidelines for testing of chemicals 211 , adopted 3 October 2008  
 VALIDATION STATUS: This guideline  is based on OECD Guideline 202, partII  (1982), research 
activities due to the identification of the reasons for variable test results, ring -tests 
performed in 1992 and 1994, EPA/600/4- 90/027F (1993), ASTM  E729 -88a( 1988) et.al  
 IN VIVO / IN VITRO TEST METHOD: In vivo  
 EXPOSURE ROUTE(S): Dir ectly, across surface  
 EXPOSURE VOLUME(S): At least 2 ml of test solution should be provided for each animal.  
 ANIMAL / CELL CULTURE INFORMATION (INCLUDING NO. ANIMALS/CELL CULTURE CONC.):  The species to be used in the test is Daphnia magna Straus. Preferably, the clone identified 
by genotyping and belongs to Clone A (originated from IRCHA in France).  At the start of the 
test, the animals should be less than 24 hours old and must not be first brood progeny. They should be derived from a healthy stock  (i.e. showing no signs of stress such as high mortality, 
presence of males and ephippia, delay in the production of the first brood, discoloured animals, etc) that is maintained in culture conditions (light, temperature, medium, feeding and animals per un it volume) similar to those to be used in the test.  
 NO. GENERATION OF ORGANISM TESTED: Two  
 TEST DURATION: 21 days  
 INSTRUMENT REQUIREMENTS (EXPOSURE, MEASUREMENTS ETC.): Test vessels, oxygen -
meter, pH -meter, adequate apparatus for temperature control, equipment for the 
determination of TOC and C OD, equipment for the determination of hardness of the water, 
apparatus for the control of the lighting regime and measurement of light intensity.  
 TEST PRINCIPLES AND DESCRIPTION:  The primary objective of the test is to assess the effect of chemicals on the reproductive output of Daphnia magna. Young female Daphnia (the parent animals), are exposed to the 
test substance added to water at a rang e of concentrations. The test duration is 21 days. At 
the end of the test, the total number of living offspring produced per parent animal alive at Appendix E_TEST METHOD EVALUATION_Ecotox_shv.docx    12/10/2010  Page 12 of 13 pages  the end of the test is assessed. The reproductive output of the animals exposed to the test 
substance is com pared to that of the control(s) in order to determine LOEC and hence the 
NOEC. In addition, the data are analysed using a regression model in order to estimate the concentration that would cause a x % reduction in reproductive output, i.e. ECx (e.g. EC50, EC20 or EC10). Other substance -related effects on parameters such as growth (e.g. length), 
and possibly intrinsic rate of increase, may also be examined.  
 
Test solutions of the chosen concentrations are usually prepared by dilution of a stock solution Norm ally there should be at least five test concentrations arranged in a geometric 
series with a separation factor preferably not exceeding 3.2.The use of organic solvents or dispersants may be required in some cases, but every effort should be made to avoid the use of such materials.  Parent animals are maintained individually, one per test vessel, with 50 - 
100 ml of medium in each vessel. For semi -static tests, at least 10 animals individually held 
at each test concentration and in the control series. For flow -through tests, 40 animals 
divided into four groups of 10 animals at each test concentration.  The offspring produced by 
each parent animal should preferably be removed and counted daily from the appearance of 
the first brood to prevent them consuming food intended for the adult. It is only the number of living offspring that needs to be counted, but the presence of aborted eggs or dead offspring should be recorded. Mortality among the parent animals should be recorded preferably daily, at least at the s ame times as offspring are counted. Growth measurements 
are highly desirable since they provide information on possible sublethal effects which may be more useful than reproduction measures alone. Other parameters that can be measured or calculated include  
time to production of first brood (and subsequent broods), number and 
size of broods per animal, number of aborted broods, presence of male neonates or ephippia and possibly the intrinsic rate of population .  
 Oxygen concentration, temperature, hardness a nd pH values should be measured at least 
once a week, in fresh and old media, in the control(s) and in the highest test substance 
concentration. During the test, the concentrations of test substance are determined at 
regular intervals.  
 HSE CONSIDERATIONS : Reference and test substances should be handles according to MSDS.  
 CRITERIA FOR HAZARD EVALUATION CLASSIFICATION:  
For a test to be valid, the following performance criteria should be met in the control(s):  
• the mortality of the parent animals does not exceed 20% at the end of the test 
• the mean number of live offspring produced per parent animal surviving at the end of the test is > 60.

 REFERENCE SUBSTANCE(S): Recommended (no specific chemicals described)  
 CONTROLS:  
Sterilised soil and samples for abiotic degradation control. Soil without test substance added.  
 TEST PRINCIPLE :  
Soils samples are treated with test substance and incubated in the dark in Biometer- type flasks or in flow -
through systems under controlled laboratory conditions (constant temperature and soil moisture).  After 
appropriate time intervals soil samples are e xtracted and analysed for the parent substance and for 
transformation products (volatile compounds may also be analysed). If 14C-labelled test substance are used 
mineralisation may be determined as release of 14CO 2 from the test substance is measured by means of alkali 
absorption and liquid scintillation counting.     
 
TEST DURATION: Up to 120 days at 20 ± 2°C (10 ± 2°C may be used for colder climates), or after 90 
% depletion

(if 14C-labelled test substances are used), instruments for identification purposes (e.g. MS, GC -MS, 
HPLC- MS, NMR), oxidiser for combustion of radioactive material (if necessary), centrifuge, 
extraction apparatus (e.g. Soxhlet), instrumentation for concentration (e.g. Rotavapor), water bath, 
mechanical mixing device  
 TEST DESCRIPTION:  
For transformation studie s under aerobic conditions soil moisture must be adjusted (pF between 2.0 and 
2.5), while soil is flooded for anaerobic conditions.  
 
 About 50 -200 g soil (dry weight) is placed in each incubation flask, and the soil treated with test substance. 
Test substa nce may be dissolved in water, in an organic solvent (the solvent must be evaporated before 
application and not interfere with biodegradation or analytical results), or be added to the soil as a solid. The 
soil is thoroughly mixed with the test substance ( small aliquotes of the soil should be tested for 
homogeneous application of test substance). The test substance treatment rate should correspond to the highest relevant application rate, and to an appropriate depth in the soil (e.g. 10 cm depth).  
 Also un treated soil samples (no test substance added) are treated in the same manner. If test substance is 
dissolved in solvent this control should include solvent treated in the same way as the test substance.  
 
The flasks with treated soil are either attached to a flow -through system or incubated as individual entities 
(Biometer flasks).  
 
Duplicate samples are collected at appropriate times and analysed for test substance and/or transformation products. Sampling frequency may be every  7  day during the first month and every 14 day after one month. 
A typical test sampling may be: day 0, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 2 months, 3 months, etc.). Biodegradation rates are calculated by first -order rate kinetics, and including calculations of transformat ion half- life (DT
50). Major 
transformation products may be identified, if possible.   If different temperatures are used, transformation rates should be described as a function of temperature, 
using the Arrhenius relationship. 
 
 
HSE CONSIDERATIONS:  Test substances (and reference substance in used) should be handled 
according to MSDS. Special precautions should be used for the handling of radioactive material

1. Introduction  
 
Risk assessments vary widely in scope and application. Some look at single risks in a range of exposure 
scenarios whereas others are site -specific and look at the range of risks posed by an installation. In broad 
terms risk assessments are carried out to examine the effects of an agent on humans (Health Risk 
Assessment) and ecosystems (Ecol ogical Risk Assessment). Risk assessment is carried out to enable a risk 
management decision to be made. Risk management is the decision -making process through which 
choices can be made between a range of options which achieve the "required outcome", and s hould 
result in risks being reduced to an "acceptable" level (EEA, 1998).  
 
 
2. Risk assessment for human health   
 
The aim of a risk assessment is to combine characteristics of chemical hazards with expected exposure 
scenarios. The product is to establish a gu ideline for safe use of the chemical. The guideline can be a 
regulation as to its safe use in products or exposure limits in food, air and water. Risk assessment is a 
combination of the likelihood of an occurrence and the severity of the consequences. Thus , it is based on 
the hazard profile of a chemical as well as a set potential exposure scenarios. A risk assessment is 
therefore connected to what is considered as critical effects of the chemical as well as the intended use. 
For a given hazardous chemical the guideline will differ considerably depending on e.g. the population for 
which it is intended. As an example; we would not recommend the use of a carcinogen in children’s toy 
but we accept it as an intermediary product in industry where the workers are properly educated and 
protected. In conclusion, the risk assessment is not a uniform exercise but rather directed to specific 
situations or populations.  
 
In the current project chemicals are to be release to the atmosphere. The plant is part of a large 
petrochemical based industrial area situated in a rural area. The population of potential exposure will 
reflect any population as to gender, age and health status. We should therefore consider exposure as air 
contamination to the general public, and any guide line should have the general population rather than 
the occupationally exposed as its “target” population.  
Some of the flue emission substances may precipitate and find their way through water or the food chain 
to people. Thus, exposure may go beyond direc t inhalation. However, in the present –  first attempt – risk 
assessment we have addressed this as an inhalation problem only.  
Whenever we have had to do an “expert opinion” on matters that cannot be readily converted into some classification we have chose n to be very conservative and make potential errors on the safe side. Thus, 
the reader should assume that any later revisions resulting from more data should increase rather than 
decrease the ambient air standard that we suggest in this chapter.  
The chemic als that have been identified as potential releases from the plant represent a variety of health 
effects:  • Irritant to skin and airways  
• Sensitizers to skin and airways  
• Systemic toxicity after oral, percutaneous and inhalation exposure  
• Carcinogenic  
• Mutagenic  
• Reproductive effects  
 
Some of these effects can only be observed after exposure to relatively high concentrations during acute 
exposure.  
 
Exposure to the general population around an industrial facility like Mongstad is characterized as low -
level continu ous exposure and it is not expected that acute effects should be observed. We therefore 
need to focus on compounds causing effects that may occur after long- term and low level exposure. Such 
effects include carcinogenesis, mutagenesis and changes in fertility and reproduction  and inhalation 
sensitization . 
The aim of risk assessment in the current project is:  
• determine the critical effect 
• determine a no effect dose for the most critical effect  
• suggest an ambient air standard  
• compare the ambient air standard  with the expected flue gas concentration  
 
The critical effect  
 
This project specifies a total of 13 substances. The toxic effects noted after a database and literature 
search includes all endpoints presented in the introduction above. However, there are two chemical 
groups that deserve special attention : 
• nitrosamines which include both acute and serious long term effects  
• nitramin es where data is very sparse, but long term serious effects is to be expected.  
 
We suggest that genetic effects (mutagenic and ca rcinogenic) and effects on reproduction are considered 
as the critical effects for the risk assessment.  
 
1.1 Risk assessment for mutagenic/carcinogenic compounds following ECHA and REACH  
 
Guidelines  
There are several Guidelines for Risk assessment (RA) of chemicals and substances. Generally, t he 
recommended risk assessment techniques take into account the inherent toxicity of a substance as well 
as the type and degree of exposure. Risk models incorporate s assumptions that w ill nearly always over 
predict  health risks and thus to assure the outcome is protective of health. REACH (Annex I, 1.0.1) defines the Derived No -Effect Level (DNEL), i.e. the level of exposure above which humans should not be 
exposed. In the risk characterisation, the exposure of each hum an population likely or known to be 
exposed is compared with the appropriate DNEL. The risk to humans is considered to be adequately 
controlled if the exposure levels estimated do n ot exceed the appropriate DNEL (REACH Annex I, 6.4).  
 
Whereas the former legislation on new and existing substances required a comprehensive RA  and a risk 
characterisation (RC) for all relevant toxicological effects, REACH requires a RC for the leading health 
effect (i.e., the toxicological effect that results in the most critica l DNEL) for a given exposure pattern 
(such as duration, frequency, route of exposure and exposed human population) which is associated with 
an exposure scenario. In case of flue gas  compounds both mutagenicity/carcinogenicity as well as 
reproductive toxici ty are consider as worst effects endpoints.  
 
Derivation of the dose -descriptor  
The data for calculating dose -descriptors come preferentially from lifetime oral or inhalation studies 
according to Annex V of Directive 67/548/EEC or other accepted guidelines  (e.g. OECD guidelines). For a 
substance considered genotoxic any tumour type observed in an animal bioassay is taken as relevant to 
humans and as starting point for a dose -descriptor determination, unless evidence to deviate from this 
approach is consider ed sufficiently convincing. This also concerns non -genotoxic carcinogens with tumour 
promoting mode of action.  
 
The specific dose descriptors:  
LD50:   Median lethal dose. The dose causing 50 % lethality  
LOAEL:  Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level  
NOEL:   No Adverse Effect Level (NOEL) -  the highest dose with no toxic effects  
BMD:  The Benchmark dose; BMD concept involves fitting a mathematical model to dose -
response data. The BMD is defined as the dose causing a predetermined change in 
response.  
BMD10:  The Benchmark -dose associated with a 10% response (for tumours upon lifetime exposure 
after correction for spontaneous incidence, for other effects in a specified study)  
BMDL10:  Defined as the lower 95% confidence dose of a Benchmark- dose representing a 10% 
tumor response upon lifetime exposure, i.e. the lower 95% confidence dose of a BMD10.  
ED10:  Effective dose 10 %; a dose representing an increased incidence of 10 % due to a specific 
exposure (e.g., to a chemical).  
TD50:  The median toxic dose  of a drug o r toxin is the dose at which toxicity occurs in 50% of 
cases  
DNEL:   Derived no effect -level (DNEL)  
DMEL:  Derived Minimal -Effect Level; For non -threshold effects, the underlying assumption is 
that a no- effect -level cannot be established and a DMEL therefo re expresses an exposure 
level corresponding to a low, possibly theoretical, risk, which should be seen as a tolerable 
risk. 
T25:  The dose -descriptor value T25 is defined as the chronic dose rate that will give 25% of the 
animals’ tumours at a specific ti ssue site and is calculated from the tumour incidence at the 
selected tumorigenic using linear intrapolation or extrapolation (Dybing et al. 1997).  
 In the European Guidelines  the T25 dose -descriptor is in use for concentration limits of carcinogens , for 
non-threshold carcinogens and for risk characterization of chemicals in general ( Annex I of Directive 
67/548/EEC , EC, 1998 ; EC Regulation 1488/94; EC, 1994 ; SCCNFP/00690/03 ). The BMD10 has regulatory 
use as i ts lowest confidence value BMDL10 for the assessm ent of risks of  food ingredients ( EFSA, 2005)  
and comparable  dose descriptor, ED10  (LED10), in cancer risk assessment practice by Environmental 
Protection Agency (US EPA, 2005).  
 
For derivation of t he DNEL  (or equivalent dose descriptor  T25, ED10, BMD10)  the leading health effect for 
a given exposure pattern (exposure route, population and duration) needs to be selected. For some 
compounds DNEL cannot be derived either because not available data, data for one or several endpoints 
are missing or because of non-threshold effects. This is especially the case for the endpoints mutagenicity 
and carcinogenicity when involving a non -threshold mode of action (REACH Annex I, 1.4.1).  D ue to the 
high uncertainties in establishing safe exposure levels, f or th e non-threshold compounds, a substantially 
different approach is needed in relation to assessing risk.  RA is usually derived, if possible, from long -term 
animal studies but  more recently in  vitro studies and more adequate human epidemiological studies data 
are recommended to be used to determine the NOEL and DNEL. A large safety factor is then added ––  to 
arrive at a safe level for human s.  
 
The safety (assessment) factor  
The safety (assessment) factor  (AF) is built in partly to account for the differences between animals and 
humans, and also to allow for the variability between different population s, and individual variations 
among people, such as age, genetic background, health and how well nourished they are. The safety 
factor also account for many uncertainty factors, such as the variability in the experimental information 
and or inter and intra- species variation (including individual susceptibility); the nature and severity of the 
effect; the sensitivity  of the human (sub -) population to which the quantitative and/or qualitative 
information on exposure applies, etc. DNELs must consider populations (workers, consumers, general 
population), exposure routes  (inhalation, dermal/eye, oral) and  duration of expo sure .  
1.2  The worst case approach  
In some cases we do not have appropriate data for each compound in order to develop DNEL or DMEL 
values as described by REACH. Alternatives are then:  
• Read -across from similar substances  
• Use of established standards, e.g. OEL  
Both these procedures have been discussed and accepted by REACH as valid for preliminary risk 
assessments (Guideline document chapter R4, section R.4.3.2.2 for grouping of substances and chapter 
R8, appendix R8 -13 for the use of OEL)  
When there is an urgent need to develop a preliminary risk assessment a hazard profile for a group of 
substances can be developed on the basis of worst case criteria. For a given group of chemicals which 
have the same functional group of toxicity we may combine the data from individual members of that 
group into a hazard profile. We may then use whatever exposure standard is available (occupational or 
general public) for individual members of that group to develop an interim exposure standard which 
applies to all members of that chemical group. Applying such a procedure may cause some chemicals to receive a stricter regulation than needed – it is thus an approach where you will err on the safe side. In 
the present case such an approach can be applie d to nitrosamines and nitramin es. It should be reiterated 
that this is a provisional and temporary risk assessment until such time that appropriate data is available.   
 
 3. Risk assessment for the environment  
 
3.1 Summary  
 
Environmental risk assessment involves the assessment of the risks posed by the presence of substances 
released to the environment, on all living organisms in the variety of ecosystems which make up the 
environment.  Environmental risk assessment methodology has been developed from methods 
established for human health. Hea lth risk assessment is concerned with individuals and morbidity and 
mortality, where environmental risk assessment is concerned with populations and communities and the 
effects of substances on a number of endpoints, usually mortality. Environmental r isk assessment must 
take into account a high number of organisms; all with varying sensitivities to chemicals and various groups have different exposure scenarios. Because of the difficulty in obtaining toxicity data on all 
organisms in an ecosystem, the usual practice is to use data on selected organisms as representatives for 
the whole system  (EEA, 1998).  
 
There are a number of challenges involved when performing an e nvironmental risk assessment, i.e.:  
• Determining the effects at population and community leve l; 
• Selection of end -points;  
• Selection of species representative for the system;  
• The selection of field, laboratory, mesocosm and microcosm tests;  
• The incorporation of resilience and recovery factors of the ecosystem  
  
3.2  Definitions  of environmental hazard and environmental risk 
 
The use of the terms ‘hazard’ and ‘risk’ are frequently confused and therefore misused with the field of 
environmental assessment. This section aims to define the difference between the two terms, and how 
they will be used wit hin this document.  The term hazard is commonly defined as "the potential to cause 
harm". A hazard can be defined as "a property or situation that in particular circumstances could lead to 
harm" (EEA, 1998). The term risk is used in everyday language to mean "chance of damage / disaster". 
When used in the process of risk assessment it has specific definitions, the most commonly accepted 
being "The combination of the probability, or frequency, of occurrence of a defined hazard and the 
magnitude of the consequ ences of the occurrence" (EEA, 1998).  Therefore, the following summary of 
hazard and risk can be used:  
 
• Hazard is the potential to cause harm.  
• Risk is the likelihood of harm.  
 
If all other factors are equal, especially the exposures and the organisms subject to them, then the risk is 
proportional to the hazard. However, all other factors are rarely equal.  Today risk -based assessment 
approaches are preferred prior to hazard -based approaches. This is partly due to the recognition that for 
many environmen tal issues a level of zero risk is unobtainable or not necessary for human and 
environmental protection and that a certain level of risk can be accepted.  
  
3.3  Constituent elements of environmental risk assessment  
 
The process of environmental risk assessment described by the OECD (OECD, 2010) and EU (EU TGD, 
2003) includes four steps:  
 
• hazard identification  
• hazard characterisation  
• exposure assessment  
• risk characteris ation  
 The first two steps are regarded as the process of ‘hazard assessment’.  
 
Hazard assessment  
The OECD (OECD, 2010), describes the process of environmental hazard assessment as 
follows:  
 
“Identifying and characterising the inherent properties of chemical substances is basically the first step of environmental risk assessment. Environmental hazard assessment (hazard 
identification and hazard characterisation) involves gathering or generating and evaluating data of chemical substances and concluding on their inherent eco -toxicological effects and 
environmental fate.”  
 
Exposure as sessment  
The OECD (OECD, 2010), describes the process of environmental exposure assessment as 
follows:  
 “Exposure assessment involves estimating or predicting the extent of exposure of chemicals 
to the target species and/or the environment through its prod uction, use and disposal.”  
 
Risk characterisation  
The OECD (OECD, 2010), describes the process of environmental exposure assessment as 
follows:  
 
“Risk characterisation is the qualitative and, wherever possible, quantitative determination of the 
probability  of occurrence of the adverse effects of chemicals to the environment under predicted 
exposure conditions. This process is based on outcomes of the previous steps, i.e. environmental hazard 
and environmental exposure assessment.”  
 
This final step  is a comb ination of environmental hazard and environm ental exposure as indicated in 
Figure 1. This implies that there is no direct relation between hazard and risk ; a chemical with a high 
potential hazard may have a small environmental risk if the (probability of) environmental exposure is 
very small. Accordingly a chemical with a low potential hazard may have a have a high environmental risk 
if the exposure is high.   The presen t chapter  focu ses on identifying the potential hazard of the  CO 2 
capture plant releases to air.

3.4 Review of available environmental risk assessment methods  
This section will provide an overview of the main environmental risk assessment methods available. 
These have all been prepared and adopted by widely known government bodies such as the European 
Union and the USA.  
 
3.4.1  US Environment Protection Agency (EPA) guidel ines 
 
The US Environmental Protection Agency has published a number of guidelines for risk assessments, 
where the most relevant guidelines are:  
• Guidelines for exposure assessment (EPA/600/Z -92/001 May 1992)  
• Guidelines for Reproductive Toxicity Risk Assessm ent (EPA/630/R -96/009 October 1996)  
• Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment (EPA/630/P -03/001F March 2005)  
• Guidelines for Developmental Toxicity Risk Assessment (EPA/600/FR -91/001 December 1991)  
• Guidelines for Ecological Risk Assessment (EPA/630/R -95/002 F April 1998)  
• Supplementary Guidance for Conducting Health Risk Assessment of Chemical Mixtures 
(EPA/630/R -00/002 August 2000)  
As described by EPA, Environmental Risk Assessments are typically iterative processes and include a number of steps:  
• Problem Formulation  
• Analysis  
o Characterization of exposure  
o Characterization of effects  
• Risk characterization   Hazard

• Risk management  
This is schematically shown in Figure 2.  
 
Figure 2.  Typical steps in ecological risk assessment. Adopted from EPA/630/R -95/002F.  
 
These guidelines can be regarded as a flexible framework, enabling users to establish risk assessment 
methods suited for specific problems. There are no described methods that can be used directly for 
amine -based carbon capture processes without carrying out the necessary steps involved. The 
methodology described by EPA is a ve ry good basis for establishment of Risk Assessments, and is in 
accord ance with the more operative PEC/PNEC approach  described in the EU TGD ( EU TGD, 2003 ). 
 
   
3.4.2   European Union Technical Guidance Document  (EU TGD)  
3.4.2.1  Summary  
 
Risk assessment is based upon a ‘risk characterisation’ which is derived from an ‘effects assessment’ and 
an ‘exposure assessment’:  
 
• Effects Assessment
ecotoxicity data involves the identification of the hazard based on its physico -chemical 
properties, ecotoxicity and intended use, and the estimation of a Predicted No Effect 
Concentration (PNEC), derived from  and the ap plication of assessment factors.  
 
• Exposure Assessment
  involves the calculation of a Pred icted Environmental Concentration (PEC). 
This is derived using monitoring data, realistic worst cases scenarios and predictive modelling  
techniques. It is a complex task and should consider release, degradation, and transport and fate 
mechanisms.  
• Risk Characterisation
  involves the calculation of a quotient -  the PEC/PNEC ratio. If the ratio is less 
than 1 the substance is considered to present no risk to the environment in a given scenario.  
 
3.4.2.2  Description  of risk assessment  
 
The environmental risk assessment approach outlined in EU TGD (EU TGD, 2003) addresses the concern 
for the potential impact of individual substances on the environment by examining both exposures resulting from discharges and/or releases of chemicals and t he effects of such emissions on the structure 
and function of the ecosystem. Three specific approaches are described, representing quantitative, 
qualitative and PBT which describes the potential for a chemical to be persistent, bioaccumulative and 
toxic.  Of most relevance to the current TQP Amine 3 project is the quantitative approach. This provides a 
PEC/PNEC estimation for the environmental risk assessment of a substance by comparing compartmental 
concentrations (predicted environmental concentration; PEC ) with the concentration below which 
unacceptable effects on organisms will most likely not occur (predicted no effect concentration; PNEC).  
 
Dependent on the PEC/PNEC ratio the decision whether a substance presents a risk to organisms  in the 
environment is taken. If it is not possible to conduct a quantitative risk assessment, either  because the 
PEC or the PNEC or both cannot be derived, a qualitative evaluation is carried out  of the risk that an 
adverse effect may occur.  PEC values are  derived for local as well as regional situations, each of them 
based on a number of specific  emission characteristics with respect to time and scale. As a consequence, 
the comparison of  PNEC values for the different environmental compartments with different PEC values 
for d ifferent exposure scenarios can lead to a number of PEC/PNEC ratios.  
 
In some cases, the quantitative risk assessment approach may not provide sufficient confidence that the 
environmental compartment or targets considered are sufficiently protected. The PB T assessment is then 
used with the aim of identifying these cases.  
 
 
 3.4.2.3  Defining e nvironmental compartment s for risk assessment  
 
The EU TGD states that the environmental risk assessment has been developed, and should therefore  be 
carried out , for the following compartments:  
 
Inland risk assessment:  
 
•  aquatic environment  (including sediment)  
• terrestrial environment  
• atmosphere  
 Marine risk assessment:  
 
• aquatic environment (including sediment)  
  
In addition to the three primary environmental compartments (aquatic, terrestrial and atmosphere) 
effects relevant to the food chain (secondary poisoning) are considered. Also effects on the 
microbiological activity of sewage treatment systems are considered.  
 The methodologies implemented have as aim the identific ation of acceptable or unacceptable risks. This 
identification provides the basis for the regulatory decisions, which follow from the risk assessment.  
 
3.4.2.4  Exposure assessment: Preparation of predicted environmental concentrations (PECs)  
 
Environmental exposure assessment is completed by the determination of PEC values. PECs can be 
derived from available measured data (if available) and/or model calculations.  Relevant measured data 
from substances with analogous use and exposure patterns or  analogous properties, if available, should 
also be considered when applying model calculations. Preference should be given to adequately 
measured, representative exposure data where these are available. Consideration should be given to 
whether the substan ce being assessed can be degraded, biotically or abiotically, to give stable and/or 
toxic degradation products. Where such degradation can occur, the assessment should give due consideration to the properties (including toxic effects) of  the products that might arise.  
 For new substances, it is unlikely that information will be available on such degradation products and 
thus only a qualitative assessment would normally be possible.  No measured environmental 
concentrations will normally be available for new substances. Therefore, concentrations of a substance in 
the environment must be estimated.  Measured  concentrations can have a considerable uncertainty 
associated with them, due to temporal and  spatial variations. Therefore, b oth measurement and 
modelling approaches complement each other in the complex interpretation and  integration of the data.  
 
For the release estimation of substances, a distinction is usually made between substances that are 
emitted through point sources at specific locations and substanc es that enter the environment through 
diffuse releases. Point source releases have a major impact on the environmental concentration on a 
local scale (PEClocal) and also contribute to the environmental concentrations on a larger scale 
(PECregional).  
 When determining a PEC for new substances at base -set level, or at the 10 tonnes per annum production 
level, estimates will usually focus on the generic local environment to which releases may occur. In the 
case of persistent and/or highly toxic chemicals, howe ver, a regional assessment may still be relevant at 
low tonnages. Therefore, derivation of a PECregional is required, unless it can be justified that a regional 
assessment is not relevant for the substance at these low tonnages.  
 
PEClocal is calculated on the basis of a daily release rate, regardless of whether the discharge is 
intermittent or continuous. It represents the concentration expected at a certain distance from the 
source on a day when discharge occurs.  In principle, degradation and distribution  processes are taken 
into consideration for the PEClocal. However, because of the relatively small spatial scale, only one or two 
key processes typically govern the ultimate concentration in a compartment.  
 
The PECregional takes into account the further distribution and fate of the chemical upon release. It also 
provides a background concentration to be incorporated in the calculation of the PEClocal. The PECregional is assumed to be a steady -state concentration of the subs tance.  
 
For the derivation of PECs at the local and regional scale, a standardised generic environment, with 
default values is used as specified in the EU TGD. The characteristics of the real environment will, obviously, vary in time and space. When more specific information is available on the location of the 
emission sources, this information can be applied in refinement of the PEC by deviating from the default 
values.  
 
There are a large number of environmental fate processes which can significantly effe ct the 
concentration of a chemical released to the environment. These processes are discussed and evaluated as part of the environmental exposure assessment part of the risk assessment in the EU TGD. Briefly, these 
include:  
 
• Partition coefficients  
o Adsorpti on to aerosol particles  
o Volatilisation (partitioning between air and water)  
o Adsorption/desorption (partitioning between solids and water in soil, sediment and suspended matter)  
 
• Abiotic and biotic degradation processes  
o Hydrolysis  
o Photolysis in water  
o Photoc hemical reactions in the atmosphere  
o Biodegradation in a sewage treatment plant  
o Biodegradation in surface water, sediment and soil  
 Based on this information, local PECs and regional PECs are then derived for all environmental 
compartments , including ground waters  using a variety of parameters : 
 
• PEClocal for the atmosphere  
o Local concentration in air during emission episode  
o Annual average local concentration in air  
o Total deposition flux (annual averge)  
 • PEClo cal for the aquatic compartment  
o Local concentration in surface water during emission episode  
o Annual average local concentration in surface water  
 
• PEClocal for sediment  
o Local concentration in sediment during emission episode  
 
• PEClocal for the soil compartment  
o Local concentration in agricultural soil (averaged over a certain time period)  
o Local concentration in grassland (averaged over a certain time period)  
o Percentage of steady -state situation (to indicate persistency)  
 
• Concentration in groundwater  
o Local concentration in groundwater  
 
• PECregional  
o Regional computations are done by means of multimedia fate models based ont he 
fugacity concept  
 
The EU TGD (EU TGD, 2003) describes the relationship between the local emission routes and the 
subsequent distribution processes, which may be relevant for the  different environmental 
compartments. For each compartment, specific fate and distribution models are applied ( Figure 3). As the 
emissions from the Mongstad CO 2 capture plant are expected to be to the atmosphere only, some of the 
environmental compartments do not need to be included into the risk assessment. Based on the 
information that there will be no liquid emissions to the local area (including t o sewage treatment 
plants), risk assessment of the surface water and sediment compartments will not be necessary. This is 
because the primary route of distribution to these environmental compartments is via dilution in the 
effluent from sewage treatment plants.   
Figure 3. Local relevant emission and distribution routes (adopted from EU TGD, 2003)  
 
 
3.4.2.5  Effects assessment: Preparation of predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs)  
 
Effects assessment comprises the following steps of the risk assessment procedure:  
 
• Hazard identification
• : The aim of the hazard identification is to identify the effects of concern.  
Dose (concentration) -  response (effect) assessment
 : At this step the predicted no effect 
concentration (PNEC), shall, where possible, be determined.  
The environmental effects assessment is completed by the determination of PNEC values. A PNEC value 
has to be derived for each of the environmental compartments specified in section 1.3. 4.2.3. PNECs can 
be derived from available measured data (if available) and/or model calculations.  It is typical to start the 
effects assessment process with an evaluation of the available ec otoxicological data.  A PNEC is regarded 
as a concentration below which an unacceptable effect will most likely not occur. In principle, the PNEC is 
calculated by dividing the lowest short -term L(E)C50 or long -term NOEC (no effect concentration) value 
by an  appropriate assessment factor. See section 1.3.4.2.6  for a description of assessment factor and 
their use in risk assessment.  
 
A detailed assessment of the environmental risk is typically only feasible for the water compartment, 
especially for new substances. This is due tot he fact that most ecotoxicity studies are performed using 
aquatic organisms. Often, no ecotoxicity data will be available for sediment -dwelling organisms, as 
appropriate test systems and standardised guidelines are still under development. In this case, the 
equilibrium partitioning method is proposed as a screening method for derivation of a PNEC sed to 
compensa te for this lack of toxicity data.  Similarly, few toxicity data are typically available for the soil 
compartment. If test data are lacking, the equilibrium partitioning method can be used to derive a 
PNEC soil. Biotic and abiotic effects, such as acidificat ion, are addressed for the atmosphere. In view of the 
lack of suitable data and the fact that no adequate methods are available yet to assess both types of 
effects, a provisional strategy is described in the EU TGD. Finally, chemicals showing bioaccumulati on and 
biomagnification may pose an additional threat due to exposure of organisms higher in the food chain, 
e.g. top predators. This phenomenon is called 'secondary poisoning' and has to be addressed if a chemical fulfils several criteria, e.g. indication  of a bioaccumulation potential.  
 In particular for new and existing substances where the data sets are restricted to acute toxicity testing 
with only three trophic levels, there may be effects of substances that are not so well characterised in the 
assess ment, such as:  
• Adverse effects for which no adequate testing strategy is available yet (e.g. neurotoxicity, 
behavioural effects and endocrine disrupting effects);  
• Specific effects in some taxa that cannot be modelled by extrapolation of the data of other t axa 
(for example the specific effect of organotin compounds on molluscs).  
 
The EU TGD recognises that experience with several of the described effects assessment methods is 
lacking. Thus, assessments by use of these types of methods can be uncertain. Howev er, the methods 
presented in the EU TGD make it possible to identify if the compartment under consideration is possibly 
“of concern” and whether further data, e.g. testing on relevant organisms for that compartment, should 
be obtained.  
 
The calculation of PNECs for the different environmental compartment is  approached in slightly different 
ways. A brief overview of the method for calculating the PNEC for the aquatic  is given below. The reader 
of this report is refered to the EU TGD document for more detailed calculations of this PNEC and those for 
other environmental compartments.  
 
For the aquatic environment, a PNEC is derived that, if not exceeded, ensures an overall protection of the 
environment. Certain assumptions are made concerning the aquatic environment which allow, however 
uncertain, an extrapolation to be made from single -species short -term toxicity data to ecosystem effects. 
It is assumed that ecosystem sensitivity depends on the most sensitive species and, protecting ecosystem 
structure protects community function. It is generally accepted that protection of the most sensitive 
species should protect structure, and hence function.   
 When the pool of data from which to predict ecosystem effects is very limited (e.g. only short -term 
toxicity data are available), assessment factors must be used. In this case, the effect assessment performed with assessment factors can be supported by a statistical extrapolation method is the 
database on Species Sensitiv ity Distributions (SSDs) is suf ficient for its application. If a large data set from 
long- term tests for different taxonomic groups is available, statistical extrapolation methods may be used 
to derive a PNEC. The method should be applied to all reliable available NOECs from chronic/lon g-term 
studies. The NOEC is defined as “the highest concentration tested at which the measured parameter 
shows no significant inhibition”. Ecotoxicity data for a  broad range of taxonomic groups (described in the 
EU TGD) is required. Confidence can be asso ciated with a PNEC derived by statistical extrapolation if the 
database contains at least 10 NOECs (preferably more than 15) for different species covering at least 8 
taxonomic groups.  The EU TGD states that the concentration corresponding with the point i n the SSD profile below which 5% of the species occur should be derived as an intermediate value in the 
determination of a PNEC.  
 PNEC is calculated using the following equation:  
 
 
 
Where:  
SSD is the Species Sensitivity Distribution  
50% c.i. is a 50% confidence  interval  
AF is an appropriate assessment factor between 5 and 1.  
 
3.4.2.6  Assessment factors  
 
For most substances, the pool of data from which to predict ecosystem effects is very limited as,  typically,  
only short -term toxicity data are available. In th ese circumstances, it is recognised  that, while not having 
a strong scientific validity, empirically derived assessment factors must be  used. Assessment factors have 
also been proposed by the US EPA and OECD (1992). In  applying such factors, the intention is to predict a 
concentration below which an unacceptable  effect will most likely not occur. It is not intended to be a 
level below which the chemical is  considered to be safe. However, again, it is likely that an unacceptable 
effect will not occur.  The assessment factors reflect the degree of  uncertainty in extrapolation from 
laboratory toxicity test data for a limited number of species to  the 'real' environment. Assessment factors 
applied for long -term tests are smaller as the  uncertainty of the extrapo lation from laboratory data to the 
natural environment is reduced. For  this reason long- term data are preferred to short -term data.  
 
In establishing the size of these assessment factors, a number of uncertainties must be addressed  to 
extrapolate from single -species laboratory data to a multi- species ecosystem. These are best  summarised 
under the following headings:  
• intra-  and inter -laboratory variation of toxicity data.  
• intra-  and inter -species v ariations (biological variance).  
• shor t-term to long -term toxicity extrapolation . 
• laboratory data to field impact extrapolation.  
 
The size of the assessment factor depends on the confidence with which a PNEC value can be derived 
from the available data. This confidence increases if data are av ailable on the toxicity to organisms at a 
number of trophic levels, taxonomic groups and with lifestyles representing various feeding strategies. 
Thus lower assessment factors can be used with larger and more relevant datasets than the base -set 
data. Essen tially, the more limited the existing data set is the higher the assessment factor. For example, 
when calculating the PEC
aquatic  for the freshwater aquatic compartment where only short -term toxicity 
data are available, an assessment factor of 1000 should be applied on the lowest L(E)C50 of the relevant 
available toxicity data. This is irrespective of whether or not the test species  is a standard test organism. It 
follows that a lower assessment factor should be applied on the lowest NOEC derived in long -term tests 
with a relevant organism.  
 
A different set of assessment factors are used in the calculation of PNECs for different environmental 
compartments . However, they are not used in calculating the effects assessment in the air compartment 
and marine aquatic compartment, or for assessment of secondary poisoning (both marine aquatic and 
normal aquatic compartments) . The following en vironmental compartments use assessment factors 
which are presented in Table 1-Table 4: 
 
• Aquatic compartment , PEC aquatic  (Table 1) 
• Sediment , PEC sediment  (Table 2) 
• Terrestrial compartment , PEC soil (Table 3)

The assessment factors presented in Table 1-Table 4 above  should  be considered as general factors that 
under certain circumstances may be changed. In general, justification for changing the assessment factor 
could include one or more of the fo llowing:  
 
• Evidence from structurally similar compounds ( evidence from a closely related compound may 
demonstrate that a higher or l ower factor may be appropriate).  
• Knowledge of the mode of action including endocrine disrupting effects ( some substances, by 
virtue of their structure, may be known t o act in a non -specific manner).  • The availability of test data from a wide selection of species covering additional taxonomic groups 
other than those repr esented by the base- set species.  
• The availability of test dat a from a variety of species covering the taxonomic groups of the base -
set species across at least three trophic levels. In such a case the assessment factors may only be 
lowered if these multiple data points are available for the most sensitive taxonomic g roup.  
 
 
3.4.2.7  Environmental Impact Factor (EIF)  
 
The Environmental Impact Factor (EIF) risk assessment method is a Norwegian initiative . It has been 
developed for use  as an indicator of the environmental risk caused by regular emissions to sea  (marine 
environment) . The EIF approach was originally developed in conjunction with operators on the 
Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) and  the Norwegian Authorities with the aim of  reducin g the 
environmental impacts from produced water releases ( including drill cuttings and mud releases) down to 
a level of “zero harmful effects”.   In addition to risk assessment, the EIF approach therefore provides a 
tool for reducing the environmental impacts of emissions. Essentially, the EIF can be used to measure the 
environmental benefit achieved when alternate measures are considered for reducing environmental 
impacts.  The EIF method is able to achieve this because it gives a quantitative measure of the 
environmental risks involved when effluents are discharged to sea,  and is thus able to form a basis for 
reduction of impacts in a systematic and a quantitative manner.  
 
The EIF method is based on a PEC/PNEC approach similar to that described in the EU Technical Guidance 
Document (EU TGD, 2003). Briefly, the concentration for each compound discharged into the recipient is 
compared to a concentration threshold for that compound. When the predicted (modelled) 
environmental concentration (PEC) is larger than the predicted no -effect concentration (PNEC), an 
“unacceptable” environmental risk for damage is encountered. When the PEC is lower than the PNEC 
threshold, the environmental risk is considered to be “acceptable”. An outline of the EIF method applied 
to produced water discharges is given in Johnsen et. al.  (2000 ). The method is based on calculation of the 
EIF using the numerical model DREAM (Dose related Risk and Effect Assessment Model) developed by SINTEF, with financial support from StatoilHydro, ENI, Total, ExxonMobil, Petrobras, ConocoPhillips, and 
Shell. 
 
3.4.2.8  Environmental risk and the EIF  
As the EIF method is based upon the use of PEC and PNEC values, the reader is referred to the detailed 
description  and definitions  of these terms provided by the EU TGD (EU TGD, 2003) and described in 
section 1.3.4.2 above.  However, once the PEC and PNEC values have been determined  these can then be 
used in the calculation of  the EIF.  The EIF for a single component or component gro up is related to the 
recipient water volume where the ratio PEC/PNEC exceeds unity. The ratio PEC/PNEC is related to the probability of exceeding  the PNEC level according to a method developed by Karman et. al. ( 1994 ) and 
also published by  Karman and Reeri nk (1997). When the PEC/PNEC ratio equals  1, a risk exists for impact s 
to species  representing the most sensitive 5%. Figure 4 shows the relation ship between the PEC/PNEC 
ratio and the probability of environmental impact.  
 
The EIF method has the advantage over other risk assessment methods in that it can calculate ri sk 
contributions from a sum of chemicals and/or natural compounds in the recipient. This means that the EIF approach is capable of assessing the risk associated with complex mixtures. However, this is most effective where the mode of toxicity is the same f or all compounds present in the mixture, and that the 
toxicity is additive.  
 
Figure 4. Relationship between the PEC/PNEC level and the risk level (in %) for impact to biota, based on 
Karman et. al. (1994). A PEC/PNEC ratio of 1  corresponds to a level at which there exists a possibility of 
impact to the 5% most sensitive species.  
 
 
An attractive feature of the EIF approach is that the method is able to discriminate among the various 
contributors to environmental risk. Thus it is possible to separate a chemical product into its constituents 
and calculate the EIF contribution from each of them. The results of the calculations can then be used to 
improve the product in terms of replacing the constituents in the product wit h the largest contribution to 
the EIF. This capability provides useful information when comparing alternative proposed methodologies 
for reducing environmental ris ks associated with a discharge.  
 
In addition to the marine environment, EIFs have also been d eveloped  for terrestrial and atmospheric 
environmental compartments . However, these additional EIFs have not yet been fully developed  to the 
same level as the marine environment EIF.  Owing to this limitation, it is suggested that the EIF risk 
assessment me thod is not the most suitable for use with CO 2 capture plant emissions. This is because 
these emissions are expected to be predominantly to atmospheric and terrestrial environments rather 
than the marine environment.  
 
 
3.5 Recommendation of a risk assessment m ethod for TQP Amine 3  
 
The environmental risk assessment approach recommended in this report is that outlined in the EU 
Technical Guidance Document  (EU TGD, 2003). It is suggested that this method currently offers the most 
suitable approach in the case of TQP Amine 3 , although it should be stated there are some limitations 
with the method , which are discussed below in  section  1.3.6 . It is therefore recommended that n ew or 
revised risk assessment methods which become available in the future should be evaluated within the  PEC/PNEC ratio versus environmental risk
020406080100
0.01 0.1 1 10 100 1000 10000
Ratio PEC/PNECProbability of 
environmental injury (%)5% ~ PEC/PNEC = 1  context of TQP Amine 3.  The method is  based on the relation ship between predicted environmental 
concentration  and the predicted no effect concentratio n, the PEC/PNEC approach.  
 
This risk assessment approach is recommended for use within TQP Amine 3 for the following reasons : 
 
• Quantif iable.  The method is well described, quantitative,  transparent , and allows quantitative 
documentation of improvements .   
• Public acceptance.  The method is well established within the EU and already used as a basis for 
evaluating and comparing toxicity of regular releases into the marine environment .  In Norway 
the PEC/PNEC based Environmental Impact Factor (EIF) is used as a standard for evaluating and comparing the toxicity of releases of complex mixtures from petroleum activities (produced 
water and drilling mud).  The basic concept of the EIF -method is to calculate the volume (water) 
or area (seabed) where PEC/PNEC is lager than 1 which in both cases is used as a quantitative 
value for a potential environmental impact.  
• Flexibility.  The method is flexible in that components can be changed and evaluated without 
affecting the evaluation of existing components. Furthermore, the m ethod is suitable for the 
assessment of both single chemicals and complex mixtures.  
• Incorporation of new knowledge.  When it becomes available, n ew and improved knowledge on 
toxicity and environmental concentrations may easily be incorporated into an existing 
assessment. This means the uncertainty of the risk assessment  can continuously be refined and 
reduced .  
• Identification of knowledge gaps and prioritizing of research needs . The method itself may be 
used to identify knowledge g aps as well as to  prioritis e research tasks and technology 
development. The method may , with a few assumptions , be used to pinpoint components that 
have the largest potential contribution to toxicity.  
• Suitability. As the guidance has been developed mainly  from the experience gained on individual 
organic substances, it is directly relevant in the current scenario which is concerned with  the 
emission of organic chemicals into the environment.  
• Location specific. It is recognised that exposure estimation is su bject to variation due to 
topographical and climatological variability. When more specific information on the emission of a substance is available, it may well be possible to refine the generic or site -specific assessment.  
 
 
3.6 Limitation s of the EU TGD approach  
 
This report recommends  that the EU TGD PEC/PNEC approach is the best suited  for providing the most  
reliable risk assessment of the emissions associated with amine solvent -based CO
2 capture plants . 
However, this approach still has some limitations which may affect the ultimate performance  of the risk 
assessment. The main issue surrounds the fact that the EU TGD is designed only for the testing of single 
chemicals and not mixtures. The emissions for  the CO 2 capture facility are expected to be a complex 
mixture of chemicals representing many different chemical groups with a broad range of physical and 
chemical properties. Unfortunately, such a complex mixture, or even simple mixtures (e.g. synthetic 
mixtures containing chemicals of interest) cannot be studied using this risk assessment approach. As a 
result  the EU TGD risk assessment approach should be completed individually for all chemicals in the 
emission which are identified as hazardous.  
 It shoul d be noted that t his same issue regarding the risk assessment of mixtures is a major limitation in 
all of the available risk assessment methods reviewed for this project. The exception is the environme ntal 
impact factor (EIF) method described in section 1.3.4.3 . As a result, it is recommended  that the EIF 
approach  is considered in the future as this has the capacity to address risk assessment of  mixtures. At 
present the risk assessment method is not fully developed sufficiently to be used in the assessment of 
emissions for a CO 2 capture plant. In particular, the EIFs for terrestrial and atmospheric environmental 
compartments are not fully develop ed and therefore limited. The EIF  method is , although capable of 
assessing mixtures, is based on the information for single chemicals (e.g. that used in, and required for 
the EU TGD).  Therefore, it is suggested that the EU TGD approach is used in the immed iate future as the 
data generated can be incorporated into the EIF approach at a later stage.  
 An additional limitation to the EU TGD risk assessment method is the use of assessment factors. Again, this limitation is one that is shared with all other risk  assessment methods reviewed in this document 
(e.g. US EPA and EIF). Although essential for completing the risk assessment, assessment factors 
incorporate a large degree to caution in order to ensure that a false result is not generated for a 
chemical. As a result, the environmental concentrations and toxicity effect limit ranges which are 
considered environmentally acceptable/safe are often broader than necessary.  In conclusion, it is 
recommended that the EU TGD is currently the best of the available model s despite these limitations.
