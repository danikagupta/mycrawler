This study was carried out to evaluate the dye decolorizing and detoxifying abilities of Irpex lacteus . The decolorization abilities of
14 strains of I. lacteus were investigated in agar-plates containing 3 synthetic dyes: Congo Red (CR), Orange II (OII), and Reactive
Blue 4 (RB4). In an agar plate test, I. lacteus KUC8958 showed the highest dye decolorizing rate with all 3 dyes. Subsequently, we
investigated the decolorizing and detoxifying abilities of I. lacteus KUC8958 on synthetic dyes in liquid media under both shaking and
static conditions. I. lacteus KUC8958 showed high decolorization rates for CR and BR4 (more than 95%) under shaking conditions,
but only moderate decolorization of OII (up to 53%). The dye decolorizing rates of I. lacteus KUC8958 were approximately 20% to
60% higher under shaking conditions than under static conditions. In a detoxiﬁcation assay, the toxicities of CR and OII solutionsincreased, whereas the toxicity of RB4 decreased after decolorization by I. lacteus KUC8958. Subsequently, high-performance liquid
chromatography analysis detected 2 compounds in CR and 1 compound in OII that were newly formed during the decolorizing process,
and which might be involved in the increased toxicities. Further studies are required to identify these newly formed compounds.

Introduction
Since mauve, the ﬁrst synthetic dye, was synthesized by
Perkin in 1856, a large number of synthetic dyes have
been developed and used extensively in many industriesincluding the textile dyeing industry. It is estimated that
worldwide, over 15 ×10
5tons of synthetic dyes were manu-
factured each year in the late 2000s, whereas approximately
8×105tons were produced in the late 1970s.[1]
The discharge of an enormous volume of wastewater
containing dyes is an inevitable consequence, because the
textile industry consumes large quantities of water and all
dyes cannot be completely combined with ﬁbers during thedyeing process.
[2,3]O’Neill[4]summarized previous reports
relevant to dye concentrations in textile efﬂuents, and re-
vealed that 10–500 mg/L of dyestuff is included in the efﬂu-ents. These high concentrations of dyes in efﬂuents interfere
with the penetration of visible light into water, resulting in
a hindrance to photosynthesis and a decrease in gas solu-bility, since less than 1 mg/L of dyes is highly visible.

and xenobiotic compounds.
Therefore, decolorization and detoxiﬁcation of dye-cont-
aining wastewater need to be conducted before discharg-
ing wastewater into natural water bodies. Certain physical,
chemical, and biological treatments are currently beingused for dye wastewater treatment.
[5]Although physical and
chemical methods usually show high dye-removal efﬁcien-
cies, high operating costs became a main drawback to thelarge-scale application of these methods. Due to the high
chemical stability of synthetic dyes, conventional biological
treatment using bacteria cannot remove dyes efﬁciently.
White-rot fungi have been considered by far the most ef-
ﬁcient synthetic dye decolorizing microorganisms.
[6]White-
rot fungi produce lignin-modifying enzymes such as ligninperoxidase, laccase, and manganese peroxidase during
their metabolic processes. Because lignin-modifying en-
zymes non-speciﬁcally degrade phenolic compounds, vari-ous synthetic dyes that have phenolic compounds in their
basic structure can be oxidized by lignin-modifying en-
zymes, resulting in the decolorization of synthetic dyes.Several white-rot fungi, including Bjerkandera adusta ,Ir-
pex lacteus ,Phanerochaete chrysosporium ,a n d Trametes
versicolor , have frequently been reported as effective dye-
degrading species.
[7–11]
Among these, the white-rot fungus I. lacteus is attracting
attention as a notable species for the decolorization of syn-
thetic dyes. Numerous studies have reported that I. lacteus

effectively removes chemically different dyes (e.g., Poly
R-478 and Remazol Brilliant Blue-R) by its enzymatic ac-
tion.[12–17]Novotn ´ye ta l .[10]demonstrated that among the
various white-rot fungi, I. lacteus is the one of the most
promising organisms for application to enzyme biotech-
nology and bioremediation, including dye decolorization
processes.
However, the intra-speciﬁc variation among I. lacteus
strains in the decolorization of synthetic dyes has not been
thoroughly investigated to date. Most previous work hasfocused on the ability of I. lacteus to decolorize synthetic
dyes, and on the relationship between decolorization and
enzyme production, even though intra-speciﬁc variation isfrequently observed in the fungal bioprocessing of organo-
pollutants.
[18]In addition, changes in the toxicity of syn-
thetic dyes during fungal decolorization by I. lacteus remain
to be elucidated. The objectives of the present study were to
evaluate the intra-speciﬁc variation among I. lacteus strainsin the decolorization of synthetic dyes, and to investigate
the detoxifying ability of selected I. lacteus strains during
the decolorization process.
Materials and methods
Fungal isolates
A total of 14 strains of I. lacteus (KUC8075, KUC8411,
KUC8508, KUC8604, KUC8605, KUC8813, KUC8817,
KUC8842, KUC8843, KUC8853, KUC8958, KUC9014,
KUC9124, and KUC9126), obtained from the Korea Uni-
versity Culture collection, were used in this study. Fourstrains of I. hydnoides (KUC8501, KUC8502, KUC8504,
and KUC8505) and 2 strains of T. versicolor (KUC8413
and KUC8867) were also used as reference isolates. Thefungi were transferred from stock cultures to malt extract
glucose agar (MEGA) media containing 5 g/L malt extract,

1 g/L glucose, and 20 g/L agar, and incubated at 27◦Ci n
the dark until the mycelium covered approximately 60% of
the area of the plate.
The identity of all fungi used in this study was con-
ﬁrmed using molecular methods. Brieﬂy, whole internal
transcribed spacer and partial large subunits of rDNA
were ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) us-ing 2 primer sets ITS4/ITS5 and LR0R/LR3.
[19,20]Subse-
quently, the sequences of the PCR products were compared
with data sets from GenBank and deposited into the Gen-Bank DNA sequence database (Fig. 1).
Decolorization of synthetic dyes in solid media
The decolorization abilities of the fungal isolates for syn-
thetic dyes in solid media were determined using the in
vitro bioassay described by Novotn ´ye ta l .
[21]Brieﬂy, a fun-
gal disk (5-mm diameter) was removed from a precultured
plate and inoculated into the center of a MEGA media
plate containing 100 mg/L Congo Red (CR), Reactive Blue4 (RB4), or Orange II (OII). The plates were then incubated
at 27
◦C in the dark for 6 days, and all tests were performedin triplicate. After incubation, the diameter of the decol-
orized area was determined.
Decolorization of synthetic dyes in liquid media
The KUC8958 strain of I. lacteus , which was identiﬁed
as an outstanding fungus for dye decolorization on solidmedia (see later), was further investigated for its ability to
decolorize and detoxify synthetic dyes in liquid media.
To determine the decolorizing ability of I. lacteus
KUC8958 for synthetic dyes in liquid media, 100-mL
aliquots of malt extract glucose (MEG) medium containing
each dye (5 g/L malt extract, 1 g/L glucose, and 0.1 g/Lof dye) were prepared in 250-mL ﬂasks, and autoclaved at
121
◦C for 15 min. Ten inocula (5-mm diameter) of the fun-
gus were then inoculated into the ﬂasks. Incubation was
carried out at 27◦C under 2 conditions, shaking (150 rpm)
and static. Dye-containing MEG media without inocula-tion and inoculated MEG media without dye were used as
controls.
Sampling to determine dye decolorization was carried
out every 2 days, for 2 weeks after inoculation. Two-
milliliter samples were drawn in a presterilized syringe and
ﬁltered using a 0.45- μm syringe ﬁlter to remove mycelia
from the sample. Filtered samples were used immediately
in an absorbance assay. The decolorizing rates of samples
were estimated using a spectrophotometer, by measuringthe absorbance at 495, 595, and 485 nm for CR, RB4, and
OII, respectively.
Detoxiﬁcation assay
A detoxiﬁcation assay was conducted according to the
standard procedures of the Organization for Economic

(HPLC) system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA), consisting of
2 pumps (Waters 515), an auto sampler (Waters 717 plus), aphoto diode array detector (Waters 2996, wavelength range:
190–800 nm), and an RP-C18 column (250 mm ×4.6 mm;

in the ratios 95:5 (A) and 20:80 (B), were prepared as
the mobile phase, ﬁltered using a 0.45- μm ﬁlter, and de-
gassed by ultrasonic waves prior to use. The ﬂow rate was
1.0 mL/min, and the injection volume was 20 μL. A gra-
dient was used to ensure the clear separation of differentcomponents in the samples (Table 1). The analysis was per-
formed at room temperature.
Results and discussion
Decolorization of synthetic dyes in solid media
The decolorization rates (expressed as percentages) of I. lac-
teuson synthetic dyes in solid media are shown in Table 2.
There were obvious differences in decolorizing rates among
theI. lacteus isolates. Among the 14 isolates of I. lacteus ,
8 isolates (KUC8075, KUC8411, KUC8508, KUC8604,
KUC8842, KUC8958, KUC9014, and KUC9126) were
able to form decolorization zones on dye-containing plates
regardless of the type of dye.
Although 4 isolates of I. lacteus (KUC8605, KUC8813,
KUC8817, and KUC9124) showed moderate decoloriza-
tion rates for CR and RB4, they had no decolorization
effect on OII. Two isolates of I. lacteus (KUC8843 and
KUC8853) only decolorized a small zone of the medium
containing CR (32.4–39.2%). These data provide evidence
of individual variations among the strains, although theaccurate reason is not yet fully understood. On the basis
of the intra-speciﬁc variation of I. lacteus o b s e r v e di nt h i s
study, we suggest that in order to select appropriate I. lac-
teusisolates for use in dye decolorization processes, their

actual abilities to decolorize different synthetic dyes need
to be conﬁrmed prior to application.
Another species of the genus Irpex ,I. hydnoides ,s h o w e d
no ability to decolorize OII, whereas approximately 30%
of CR and 75% of RB4 was decolorized, with little intra-
speciﬁc variation (Table 2). Two strains of T. versicolor were
able to form decolorizing zones on plates containing syn-
thetic dyes, but the efﬁciency was somewhat lower than
some strains of I. lacteus . Among all the white-rot fungi
tested, I. lacteus KUC8958 signiﬁcantly removed the origin
color of each dye tested in solid media, exhibiting decol-
orization rates of 82.1% for CR, 100% for RB4, and 76.4%
for OII. Therefore, I. lacteus KUC8958 was selected for
further investigation in liquid media.
Decolorization of synthetic dyes in liquid media
The synthetic dye decolorizing ability of I. lacteus
KUC8958, which emerged as the most effective dye-
degrader in the agar-plate screening, was tested in liquid
media under both shaking and static conditions. Over 95%of CR was decolorized within 8 days under shaking con-ditions, whereas 42% of CR remained under static condi-
tions (Fig. 2a). After 14 days’ incubation, 77% of CR was
removed under static conditions. Similar results were ob-tained in the RB4 decolorization test (Fig. 2b); 56% of RB4
remained after 14 days’ incubation under static conditions,
whereas over 95% of RB4 was removed under shaking con-ditions. In the case of OII, the decolorization rate under
shaking conditions (53%) was higher than that under static
conditions (9%), even though the decolorization rates un-der both shaking and static conditions were considerably
lower than those for CR and RB4.
A comparison of decolorization rates under shaking and
static conditions has also been performed by other re-
searchers. Rigas and Dritsa
[23]reported that the efﬁciency of
some basidiomycetes strains in decolorizing Poly R-478 was
higher under shaking conditions than under static condi-
tions. Better oxygen transfer and nutrient distribution withagitation may be responsible for the higher decolorization
rate. It has reported that dissolved oxygen (DO) is an im-
portant factor that enhances the rate of dye decolorization.Decolorization of dyes by P . chrysosporium was strongly
dependent on the DO concentration of the culture.

KUC8958 incubated in MEG media without dye; b, e and h, dye-containing MEG media without fungal inoculation; c, f and i,
dye-containing MEG media with fungal inoculation after 14 days of incubation) (color ﬁgure available online).
Therefore, the higher DO concentration could be respon-
sible for the higher dye decolorization rate under shaking
conditions.
Detoxiﬁcation assay
TU values of samples before and after decolorization are
shown in Table 3. After decolorizing treatment by I. lac-
teusKUC8958, the toxicity of RB4 decreased, whereas the
toxicities of the 2 azo dyes (CR and OII) increased. This
increased toxicity may be affected by several factors such aspH value and metabolites. The pH value may affect the TU
values of samples before and after decolorization because
the TU value is calculated based on the immobilization rateof the water ﬂea.
[25]Nevertheless, no signiﬁcant pH value
changes were detected in the samples before and after de-
colorization in this study. Therefore, there is no relation-ship between pH value changes and the increased toxicitiesof both dyes (CR and OII) in this study. Consequently,
metabolites, which have frequently been reported to be the
main factor causing increased toxicity, were investigatedusing HPLC analysis.
[26, 27]
HPLC analysis
Dye degradation was conﬁrmed by detecting peaks at the
λmaxof each dye by HPLC (Fig. 3). In the case of CR and
RB4, several peaks were identiﬁed as impurities by extract-
ing the absorption curves of these peaks (Figs. 3a and 3c).No impurity peak was detected in the sample of OII (Fig.
3e). The peaks of CR and RB4 completely disappeared after
14 days of incubation, conﬁrming the complete degrada-tion of these 2 dyes by I. lacteus KUC8958 (Figs. 3b and
3d). The area of the peak in the case of OII decreased mod-
erately after 14 days of incubation, indicating that OII waspartly degraded by I. lacteus KUC8958 (Fig. 3f).

without dye; b, e and h, dye-containing MEG media without fungal inoculation; c, f and i, dye-containing MEG media with fungal
inoculation after 14 days of incubation).
Due to the different absorption properties of metabolites
produced during dye degradation, diode array detection
(DAD) was performed to detect all peaks in the samples.The samples, which were obtained after 2-week incubations
of 3 types of liquid media (dye-containing MEG medium
with fungal inoculation, fungi-inoculated MEG medium
without dye, and the dye-containing MEG medium without
fungal inoculation), were analyzed using DAD (Fig. 4).From the DAD results, 3 new peaks were extracted at the
λ
maxof each compound, and are shown in 2-dimensional
graphs in Figure 5.
Interestingly, a new peak at 8.10 min (Compound I) was
found in MEG medium containing the dye after 14-day
incubation (Fig. 5c). This peak did not occur in inocu-lated MEG medium incubated without the dye (Fig. 5a),
or in the MEG sample with dye before incubation (Fig.
5b). Therefore, the new peak, Compound I, was identi-ﬁed as a metabolite or intermediate produced during thedegradation of CR. Another compound (Compound II)
was revealed using the same method (Fig. 5f). In the case
of OII, one peak (Compound III) was identiﬁed in theOII sample incubated with I. lacteus KUC8958 for 14 days
(Fig. 5i). These compounds might be responsible for the
increased toxicity of CR and OII after incubation. Fur-
ther studies are necessary to separate and identify these
compounds using mass spectrometry and NMR analysis.In addition, a long-term decolorization test (more than 2
weeks) should be performed to conﬁrm whether these com-
pounds are metabolites or intermediates produced duringthe decolorizing process.
Conclusion
In the present study, signiﬁcant differences in the rates ofdye decolorization of 14 isolates of I. lacteus were conﬁrmed

by the agar-plate decolorization test. Among the strains of
I. lacteus used in this study, I. lacteus KUC8958 showed
a remarkable potential to decolorize all 3 synthetic dyes
tested. In the liquid media test, the decolorization ratesexhibited by this strain for the 3 dyes under shaking con-
ditions were higher than those seen under static condi-
tions. After 14 days of incubation, 95% of both CR andRB4 in liquid media were removed under shaking con-
ditions, whereas only 77% of CR and 44% of RB4 were
removed under static conditions. In the case of OII, al-though 47% of OII remained under shaking conditions,
only 10% of OII was removed from the media under static
conditions.
The detoxiﬁcation test conﬁrmed an increase in the toxic-
ity of the 2 dyes (CR and OII). HPLC analysis revealed that
3 compounds were newly formed during the decolorizationof CR and OII by I. lacteus KUC8958, suggesting that these
are toxic metabolites or intermediates. The identiﬁcation of
the chemical structures of these compounds is necessary to
determine whether these compounds can be biodegraded
easily, as these compounds will be released into naturalwater bodies.
