Sewage treatment plant (STP) Increasing urbanization and industrialization is continuously putting a 
pressure on the ground and fresh water resource in form of quality and 
quantity. Therefore water recycling through wastewater treatment is the need 
of the present hour. Therefore in the present study the efficiency of the 
3.2MLD sewage treatment plant (STP) based on membrane bioreactor 
technology (MBR) located in Indian Farmers Fertilizer Cooperative Limited 
(IFFCO) township Aonla, Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, India was studied. The plant 
was recently commissioned on 10th of June 2022. The plant shows highest 
efficiency for turbidity (98.6%) followed by total suspended solids (TSS) 
(95.7%), chemical oxygen demand (COD) (89.0%), iron (86.7%), and 
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) (85.0%). The efficiency for the rest of the 
parameters is below 50%. The MBR based STP is working efficiently as the 
values of parameters in treated water is within the discharge standards of 
central pollution control board (CPCB) listed in The Environment (Protection) 
Rule, 1986. One of the major problems of MBR based STP reported in 
literature is membrane fouling which is also rectified in the current treatment 
plant by using sodium hypochlorite for membrane cleaning.  
 
Introduction  
Water is a natural resource of vital importance and 
act as elixir of life. It makes around 80% part of the 
protoplasm and is essential for all the cell metabolic 
activities. Water is used in almost all the activities 
of human routine life but we all underestimate the 
importance of water and thus despite this much of 
importance this natural resource is categorized as 
mismanaged resource. Continuously we are 
heading towards water shortage due to more 
extraction of groundwater than recharge (Bhutiani 
et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2010). More than 80% of 
the supplied to a residency returned as wastewater 
which is called as domestic wastewater or sewage (Bhutiani and Ahamad, 2018; Ruhela et al., 2020). 
Sewage is mixed water containing the water from 
kitchens, bathrooms, floor washing and surface 
runoff during rainy seasons (Kumar et al., 2010). 
Globally two million tonns of wastewater is 
generated and about 80% of this wastewater is 
discharged without any treatment (UNEP, 2010; 
WWAP, 2017). As per the central pollution control 
Board (CPCB) report of 2021, in class I cities of 
India, the percentage of sewage treatment in 1978 
was 39.3% (treatment of 2755MLD out of 
7006MLD generation), in 1988 was 21.7% 
(treatment of 2633MLD out of 12145MLD Journal homepage :https://www.environcj.in/

 348generation), in 1999 was 24% (treatment of 
4037MLD out of 16662MLD generation), and in 
2008 was 30.8% (treatment of 11787MLD out of 
38254MLD generation). Presently in each state of 
India, sewage generation capacity is more in 
comparison to sewage treatment. This data shows 
that public as well as government interests have 
been increased in recent decades towards the water 
recycling (Qayoom et al., 2021).   
The direct dispose of untreated wastewater makes 
the ground as well as surface water bodies 
contaminated (Yaqub et al., 2020; Osmani et al., 
2021). The consumption of contaminated water, 
unhealthy sanitation and hygiene practices alone 
contribute about 7% in disease and 19% in child 
mortality rate (Cairncross et al., 2019: Bhutiani et 
al., 2021). Due to the upgraded soaps, detergents, 
toothpaste, shampoos and increased lavish life 
style, the nature of sewage also changes (Von 
Sperling, 1996; Forrez  et al., 2011). Now days, 
besides organic matter it also contains various 
chemicals, heavy metals and pathogens (Ali  et al., 
2022). Therefore the treatment of sewage becomes 
an urgent need of the present time. Establishment of 
new STP’s requiring large land areas which are also 
an issue in developing countries like India. 
Therefore efficiency enhancement is the sustainable 
solution to the above discussed problem so that 
more water is treated effectively in short time 
period (Nelson et al., 2017). 
Due to complex nature of wastewater originated 
conventional wastewater treatment technologies 
shows low efficiency (Sahar et al., 2011). 
Therefore, trend of advanced treatment 
technologies application is going on these days.   
These technologies include membrane bioreactor 
(MBR) (Tadkaew et al., 2011), Nano filtration (NF) 
and reverse osmosis (RO) (Nghiem et al., 2004), 
and UV oxidation (Lekkerkerker-Teunissen et al., 
2012). 
About MBR based STP 
MBR technology is an advanced version of 
classical activated sludge (CAS) process. 
Membrane Bioreactor Technology (MBR) is a 
combination of two phenomenon’s that is the 
Membrane Filtration (Micro and Ultra Filtration) 
process and the Biological Process. Therefore MBR 
based Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) means STP’s where the numbers of membranes are used for the 
removal of smaller impurity particles from the 
sewage water mainly (greater than 0.1 micro-meter 
size) and these membranes are submerged in 
aerated biological reactors where the biological 
process will occur. In this biological process the air 
is added or blown into the sewage water so that the 
bacterial concentration will increases very rapidly 
in the sewage so that they easily degrade or 
digest/decompose the organic matter present in the 
sewage water and also breaks down the organic 
matter into smaller parts and this process also 
similar to the activated sludge process (Figure 1). 
So in this MBR section of the STP plant these two 
processes works together such that firstly the 
Biological process converts organic matter into 
smaller parts and after that the Membranes easily 
removes or filtered out these impurities from the 
sewage water so that we got highly treated effluent 
from this MBR section. 
MBR technology possesses several advantages such 
as smaller physical footprint and higher efficiency 
in comparison to CAS (Tadkaew et al., 2011; 
Nguyen et al., 2013). Some Advantages of MBR 
based STP plants are- 
1- It requires less space in comparison to ASP 
plants. 
2- In these plants the operation should be 
performed easily. 
3- We got the High-quality treated effluent 
from this type of STP. 
4- It produces less volume of sludge.   
MBR based STP plants can be used for Municipal 
wastewater treatment, Industrial wastewater 
treatment and many other places having less space 
so these plants are very effective. But there is one 
major problem of this MBR based STP plant is that 
the problem of membrane fouling in the membranes 
of the MBR chamber and due to this major 
problem, the efficiency of the plant decreases to 
some extent. Membrane fouling means the 
membranes or filter medias used for the removal of 
different impurities from the wastewater are to be 
blocked or clogged due to the cake formation of 
these impurities and it affect the efficiency of the 
plant but this MBR system is better than activated 
sludge plants and also, we easily solve the problem 
of membrane fouling by the help of coagulation,

adsorption process and aerobic granulation 
technique. Therefore by the help of these methods, 
we should improve the efficiency and also increases 
the life of the membranes used in the MBR section 
of this STP plant. Literature review suggests that 
anoxic MBR based STP show maximum efficiency 
(Sima et al., 2011; Xiang et al., 2014; Miura et al., 
2015; Schaeffer et al., 2018; Shen et al., 2019). 
 
Material and Methods 
Study area 
MBR based STP plant of 3.2 MLD is situated in 
IFFCO Township near IFFCO Urea Plant in Aonla, 
Bareilly, UP, India at the 28.208303 latitudes and 
79.245088 longitudes. This plant starts working 
from 10th of June 2022 and having a capacity of 
3240 m3/day. Inside the IFFCO Township this STP 
plant is located at the very back side where the 
sewage water of the whole Township collected in 
proper way. The nearest location around this plant 
is Chakarpur Ramnagar. 
Sample Collection 
Water samples were collected from inlet and outlet 
point in the morning hour. The sampling was 
performed for five months (from August 2022 to 
December 2022). Samples were collected in the 
prewashed plastic containers of 2 litres throughout   
the study period. The parameters studied during the 
study period were turbidity, total dissolved solids  
(TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), pH, 
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical 
oxygen demand (COD), total hardness, calcium, 
magnesium, iron, sulphate, alkalinity, chloride, 
sodium, and salinity. All the parameters were 
analyzed following the standard methods (APHA 
2017; Trivedy and Goel, 1986 and Khanna and 
Bhutiani, 2008). 
 
Results and Discussion 
The average results of different physicochemical 
parameters are presented in table 1 and figure 2. 
Turbidity is due to the presence of solids present in 
suspended form in the water. Turbid water 
interferes in pathogen removal process (WHO, 
2004). The turbidity in raw sewage ranged from 30-
75NTU with an average value of 62.2NTU±19.0 
and in treated water 0.5-1.4NTU with an average 
value of 0.8NTU±0.3. Therefore the efficiency of 
the plant for turbidity reduction was 98.6%. Our 
results are in full agreement with Nguyen et al. 
(2013) which observed the turbidity below 0.2NTU 
in all the samples in laboratory scale MBR based 
STP. Total Suspended Solids (TSS)is a measure of 
the floating particulate content of the wastewater

having the diameter greater than 2 micrometre and 
is an indicator of the clarity of the wastewater 
(Johal et al., 2014). During the study period, the 
range of TSS was observed from 28-92mg/l with an 
average value of 71.8mg/l±25.6 in inlet and in 
outlet from 2.6-3.5mg/l with an average value of 
3.1mg/l±0.3. Therefore the efficiency of the plant 
for TSS reduction was 95.7%. The reduction in 
suspended solids may be due to sedimentation of 
these particles. Besides this, biological degradation 
in aerobic zone is also another method observed 
(Wang et al., 2010). Xiang et al. (2014) also 
observed the similar results (more than 96%) in 
MBR based STP. Total Dissolved Solids 
(TDS)value of the wastewater is mainly due to the 
ions/salts added during the use of water or 
dissolved from the rock dissolution (Salunke et al., 
2014). During the study period, the range of TDS 
was observed from 350-400mg/l with an average 
value of 361.8mg/l±21.4 in inlet and in outlet from 
245-326mg/l with an average value of 
289.4mg/l±39.7. Therefore the efficiency of the 
plant for TDS reduction was 20.0%. TDS removal 
may be due to oxidation and biological degradation 
of dissolved solids (Singh and Varshney, 2013; 
Bhutiani et al., 2016; Ruhela  et al., 2020). 
pH is the indicator of salinity or acidity of the water 
and wastewater. Efficiency of the treatment plant 
depends of the pH value because it determine the 
transformation of many pollutants and is an   
essential measure to maintain the nutritive balance 
for the proper development of aquatic biota 
(Bolawa and Gbenle, 2012; Ruhela  et al., 2020; 
Osmani et al., 2021), and it’s optimum  range 
essential for bacterial activity (Sincero and Sincero, 
1996). During the study period, the range of pH 
was observed from 7.0-7.6 with an average value of 
7.2±0.3 in inlet and in outlet from 8.1-8.4 with an 
average value of 8.3±0.1. Therefore the efficiency 
of the plant for pH gain was 14.3%. Less removal 
percentage in pH was observed due to chlorine 
dosing to remove the color, odour and pathogens in 
treated water (Bhutiani and Ahamad, 2018; 
Showkat and Najar, 2019).   
Microbes degrade organic matter present in the 
wastewater and for this purpose they demanded the 
oxygen. Thus the amount of oxygen demanded by 
the microbial population present in fixed quantity 
of wastewater to degrade the organic matter is 
known as Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). 
Therefore the value of BOD is the indicator of 
amount of organic matter of wastewater (Hur and 
Kong, 2008). During the study period, the range of 
BOD was observed from 18-48mg/l with an 
average value of 33.6mg/l±13.6 in inlet and in 
outlet from 1.5-8.8mg/l with an average value of 
5.1mg/l±2.8. Therefore the efficiency of the plant 
for BOD reduction was 85.0%. BOD removal is 
indicative of the efficiency of biological treatment 
processes and is the most widely used parameter to

Figure 2: Showing the efficiency of STP for different physicochemical parameters  
 
measure wastewater quality. The results of this 
study are concurrent to that Bolong et al. (2022) 
and Ali et al. (2021) who observed BOD reduction 
upto 92%.Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is the 
oxygen demand raised during chemical breakdown 
of organic and inorganic matter (Bhutiani et al., 
2017; Kumar et al., 2018). Higher COD values of 
wastewater results into drastic oxygen depletion in 
the receiving water bodies. During the study period, 
the range of COD was observed from 70.6-
124.0mg/l with an average value of 94.0mg/l±19.6 
in inlet and in outlet from 4.0-18.9mg/l with an 
average value of 10.4mg/l±6.9. Therefore the 
efficiency of the plant for COD reduction was 
89.0%. The decrease may be linked to the aeration 
and digestion processes, which have also been 
confirmed by Xiang et al. (2014), Jafarzadeh et al. 
(2014), Johal et al. (2014) and Ali et al. (2021) who 
obtained 84.5%, 94%, 98%, and 91.5%  
respectively reduction in their studies. COD test is 
complex in nature but less time consuming. In our 
study COD reduction was achieved much higher 
than those of Fluidized aerobic bioreactor (FAB) 
based STP (29.00%) and less than sequential batch 
reactor (SBR) based STP (22.32%) conducted by 
Qayoom et al. (2021). Total Hardness in water is 
due to the presence of carbonate, bicarbonate, 
chloride, and sulphate of calcium and magnesium 
The main sources of Ca and Mg in wastewater are 
calcite, dolomite, magnesite, anhydrite, gypsum 
feldspar, pyroxene and amphiboles present in 
catchment. The range of Total Hardness was   
observed from 80.0-110.0mg/l with an average 
value of 94.9mg/l±12.3 in inlet and in outlet from 
38.0-62.4mg/l with an average value of 
52.7mg/l±9.6. Therefore the efficiency of the plant 
for Total Hardness reduction was 44.67%. Decrease 
in concentration could be attributed to the grit 
separation, sedimentation process and active uptake 
of calcium and magnesium by microorganisms 
during treatment (Showkat and Najar, 2019). 
During the study period, the range of calcium was 
observed from 30.0-80.7mg/l with an average value 
of 59.9mg/l±21.2 in inlet and in outlet from 25.0-
48.0mg/l with an average value of 39.7mg/l±9.4. 
Therefore the efficiency of the plant for calcium 
reduction was 33.8%. During the study period, the 
range of magnesium was observed from 4.0-
35.0mg/l with an average value of 15.8mg/l±12.2 in 
inlet and in outlet from 2.0-19.0mg/l with an 
average value of 9.4mg/l±7.4. Therefore the 
efficiency of the plant for magnesium reduction 
was 40.5%. Similar reduction in hardness, calcium 
and magnesium ion (from 39.9% to 53.97%) was 
observed by Bhutiani et al. (2017) and Ruhela et al. 
(2020). Iron in raw effluent ranged from 2.5 to 
3.3mg/l with an average value of 3.0mg/l±0.3 and 
from 0.2-0.8mg/l with an average value of 
0.4mg/l±0.3 in treated water. Therefore the 
efficiency of the plant for iron reduction was 
86.7%. In our study iron reduction was achieved 
much higher than those of Fluidized aerobic 
bioreactor (FAB) based STP (29.22%) and less than 
sequential batch reactor (SBR) based STP (52.28%)

 352conducted by Qayoom et al. (2021). Similarly, 
value of sulphate ranged from 30.0-105.0mg/l with 
an average value of 61.5mg/l±30.4 in inlet and 
from 20.0-60.0mg/l with an average value of 
32.8mg/l±17.3 in outlet. Therefore the efficiency of 
the plant for sulphate reduction was 46.7%. In our 
study sulphate reduction was achieved much higher 
than those of Fluidized aerobic bioreactor (FAB) 
based STP (25.39%) and sequential batch reactor 
(SBR) based STP (8.79%) conducted by Qayoom et 
al. (2021).Alkalinity in water is due to presence of 
carbonate, bicarbonate, phosphates, and nitrates 
along with hydroxyl radical in their free state 
(Bhutiani et al., 2016). In the raw sewage, 
alkalinity ranged from 280.0-360.0mg/l with an 
average value of 310.4mg/l±32.1 and from 200.0-
320.0mg/l in treated effluent with an average value 
of 252.0mg/l±52.2. Therefore the efficiency of the 
plant for alkalinity reduction was 18.8%. Less 
reduction in alkalinity is due to the use of base to 
adjust the pH value during the treatment processes. 
Higher concentration of chloride in water is the 
indicator of the degree of contamination by a large 
quantity of sewage inputs, detergents and soaps 
(Von Sperling, 1996). It shows that the 
contamination at the site is higher. During the study 
period, the range of chloride was observed from 
40.0-95.0mg/l with an average value of 
55.0mg/l±22.6 in inlet and in outlet from 32.0-
80.0mg/l with an average value of 44.8mg/l±20.1. 
Therefore the efficiency of the plant for chloride 
reduction was 18.5%. Less reduction in chloride 
value is pointing towards the use of high chlorine 
dosing (dosing of poly aluminum chloride) to 
remove the odour, color and pathogens which is 
also indicating towards the slow functioning or high 
organic loading in influent (Rao and Shruthi, 2002). 
In raw effluent, the range of sodium was observed 
from 110.0-150.0mg/l with an average value of 
132.4mg/l±14.8 in inlet and in outlet from 49.0-
100.0mg/l with an average value of 70.4mg/l±19.6. 
Therefore the efficiency of the plant for sodium 
reduction was 46.8%. Salinity is the amount of salts 
dissolved in a unit volume of water. Salinity can 
take three forms, classified by their causes: primary 
salinity (also called natural salinity); secondary 
salinity (also called dryland salinity), and tertiary 
salinity (also called irrigation salinity). During the 
study period, the range of salinity was observed 
from 330.0-470.0mg/l with an average value of 408.0mg/l±52.6 in inlet and in outlet from 250.0-
380.0mg/l with an average value of 
304.2mg/l±48.5. Therefore the efficiency of the 
plant for salinity reduction was 25.4%. 
 
Conclusion  
The performance of the MBR based STP located in 
IFFCO township area of Bareilly was conducted for 
a period of 5 months (August 2022 to December 
2022). The overall efficiency is in the order 
Turbidity>TSS>COD>Iron>BOD>Sodium>Sulpha
te>Total Hardness> Magnesium>Calcium> Salinity 
>TDS>Alkalinity>Chloride. In case of chloride less 
removal efficiency was observed showing the use 
of chlorine in the treatment process for the purpose 
of disinfection. The treated waste can be re-used for 
irrigation purpose. In order to improve the 
efficiencies of the STPs, the treatment systems 
must be properly operated and maintained, sources 
of raw sewage need to be identified, and existing 
facilities should be upgraded accordingly. In terms 
of proper operation and maintenance, trained and 
experienced workers are required in a defined 
period of time to assess treatment performance.
