in Bacillus Subtilis WPI
Background: Lead (Pb) is an important environmental pollutants that play a significant role in 
increasing the stability of some other pollutants by changing the microbial profile of the soil. Bacillus 
subtilis WPI is an abundant bacteria existing in wastewater. Because of laccase enzyme in this 
bacterium, the decomposition process of aromatic pollutants in wastewaters can be facilitated. We 
aimed to investigate the effect of different Pb concentrations on B. subtilis growth and biological 
activity of laccase enzyme in B. subtilis WPI.
Materials and Methods: B. subtilis WPI was isolated from the paper mill industrial wastewater of 
Hormozgan, Iran, from March to August 2017. After purification, the growth trend of B. subtilis WPI  
as well as the activity of laccase enzyme in different concentrations of Pb was investigated based on 
kinetic method.
Results: Bacterial growth at Pb concentration of 400 mg/L reduced in a dose-dependent manner, 
and this decrease was significant at concentrations of 300 and 400 mg/L (P<0.001). The level of 
laccase enzyme activity in the lead concentration range of 20-160 mg/L also reduced in a dose-
dependent manner, which implied that the highest decrease was observed at lead concentration of 
160 mg/L (P<0.01). Our findings showed that there was no significant change in bacterial growth in 
lead concentration range of 20-200 mg/L, while a significant change was observed in the activity of 
laccase enzyme in the mentioned concentration range.
Conclusion: Therefore, it seems that this reduction in enzyme activity can indirectly increase the 
stability of aromatic oil pollutants in the environment.A B S T R A C T

Introduction
urrently, urbanization and industrial de-
velopment in human societies have led 
to an ever-increase of industrial pollut-
ants in the environment [1]. Meanwhile, 
heavy metals, which are the most impor -tant environmental pollutants, in large quantities can 
cause a change in the balance of biological agents in 
the ecosystem [2]. The discharge of these elements into 
the environment is much higher than that produced 
through natural processes. Lead (Pb) as one of the 
most toxic elements that enter the environment through 
various industries, such as petrochemicals, battery pro- CArticle Type:

duction, crystallization, mining, lead processing, and 
mainly burning of fossil fuels. Lead is a metal without 
biological function [3, 4]. 
This element not only threatens human health but can 
also change the microbial profile of the ecosystem [5]. 
The increased environmental sustainability of aromatic 
pollutants in petroleum products can be considered due to 
the microbial profile change. Because of the presence of 
heavy metal-resistance systems and degrading enzymes 
for aromatic compounds in some bacteria, the bacteria 
have received more attention compared to other microor -
ganisms. The metal resistance systems have been identi-
fied in many bacterial groups B. subtilis is one of the most 
abundant bacteria in wastewater that can play a valuable 
role in the ecosystem. Previous studies reported that lac-
case enzyme affects the nature of B. Subtilis WPI [6]. 
The large distribution of this enzyme in this bacterium 
has converted it to an important indicator of environmental 
degradation [7, 8]. The laccase enzyme is a polyphenol oxi-
dase, containing several copper atoms and has been found 
in many plants, fungi, insects, and microorganisms [8, 9]. 
Due to the environmental and economic advantages of this 
enzyme and the role of B. subtilis in its production, it was 
used for degrading aromatic pollutants in wastewaters [10]. 
In this study, we investigated the effects of various lead con-
centrations on the growth of B. subtilis WPI and the biologi-
cal activity of laccase enzyme in B. subtilis WPI.
Materials and Methods
Sampling and isolation of Bacillus subtilis WPI
B. subtilis WPI was isolated from the paper mill industrial 
wastewater of Hormozgan, Iran, from March to August 
2017. Briefly, after sampling the soil, bagasse and waste-
water of the paper mill were collected from the ground of 
10-15 cm soil depth in sterile plastic bags and were kept at 
4°C [11-13]. To isolate the bacteria, 10 g of the sample was 
transferred to a 250 mL flask and mixed with 100 mL of 
sterile saline solution. Next, after the preparation of serial 
dilutions (range 10-1 - 10-9) and spared culture on a nutri-
ent agar plate (Merck, Germany), bacterial colonies were 
screened at the surface of the agar plate containing 0.5 mM 
guaiacol to determine the laccase enzyme activity.
The plates were incubated at 25-35°C for 96 h [14]. 
The isolation and screening methods were used several 
times to obtain a pure specimen that produces only one 
strain containing laccase enzymes. By considering phys-
iological and biochemical properties, the morphology of 
the strain that produces the laccase enzyme was studied. Biochemical tests were performed to detect B. subtilis 
bacteria including oxidase, catalase, amylase, mannitol, 
lactose, glucose, citrate, xylose, and sucrose [12].
Determining bacterial growth at different times
First, bacterial suspension was performed according to 
the half-McFarland standard (equal to 1.5×108 colony 
forming units (CFU /mL) and was inoculated into 20 mL 
of Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB). Next, the samples were incu-
bated in a shaker incubator at 37°C. The bacterial growth 
assay was investigated at various times (from 1 to 10 days) 
using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 600 nm [15]. 
Optimization of growth conditions of B. subtilis 
bacteria in TSB medium
The effects of temperature, growth time, and different 
concentrations of Copper (Cu) as a co-factor required for 
bactericidal activity and production of laccase enzyme 
were investigated.
Bacterial growth rate at different temperature 
The bacterial growth capability was investigated at tem-
peratures of 25°C, 30°C, 35°C, 40°C, and 45°C. The bac-
teria growth was measured over a period of 5 days using a 
spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 600 nm [15].
Optimizing laccase enzyme activity
The concentration of copper sulfate in the environment 
is another factor affecting the growth, activity, and pro-
duction of laccase enzymes in B. subtilis bacteria [16, 
17]. Therefore, different concentrations of copper sulfate 
(CuSO4) (0.1 mM, 0.2 mM, 0.3 mM, 0.4 mM, and 0.5 
mM) and control sample (without adding copper sulfate) 
were incubated for five days. The activity rate of the lac-
case enzyme at these concentrations was measured at 436 
nm wavelength using two measurements of the optical 
absorbance over three minutes interval with 2, 2-azino-bis 
(3- ethylbenzothiazoline- 6-sulfonic acid) Sigma-Aldirich 
(ABTS) substrate. Eventually, the enzyme activity was de-
termined in accordance with the following equation [18].
Enzyme activity rate = Optical Density (OD)×60×(enzyme 
value /1150)×0.371
Effect of different concentrations of lead on the 
growth of B. subtilis WPI
To obtain the optimum concentration of lead Pb(No32), 
the effects of this metal at concentration range of 40-400 
mg/L on the growth process of B. subtilis bacteria were Parisa Mehrabi Moghadam, et al

evaluated. Briefly, 1 ml of bacteria suspension was in-
cubated in 20 mL of TSB medium containing 40 mg/L, 
100 mg/L, 200 mg/L, 300 mg/L, and 400 mg/L of lead. 
Moreover, non-Pb containing medium was used as the 
control. All of the mediums were kept in a shaker incu-
bator at 150 rpm and a temperature of 35°C and their OD 
was measured at a wavelength of 600 nm for five days.
Effect of different concentrations of lead (Pb) on 
laccase activity
The lead concentrations of 160 mg/L, 80 mg/L, 40 
mg/L, and 20 mg/L were introduced into bacterial cul-
ture medium and the activity of laccase enzyme was 
measured daily for five days. Based on the results of mi-
crobial culture, there was no change in the growth rate 
of the bacteria at concentration range of 20-160 mg/L.
Statistical analysis
All experiments were performed in triplicates, and the 
data analyzed using the variance (ANOV A) followed by 
the Tukey’s test in SPSS V . 21. All the results are ex-
pressed as Mean±SD. The level of significance was de-
fined as P-values less than 0.05.
Results
Identification of B. subtilis WPI
The results obtained from the biochemical tests were 
for the identification and confirmation of B. subtilis WPI.
Optimal conditions for bacterial growth
The results obtained for B. subtilis WPI growth with-
in 10 days of incubation indicated that the highest and lowest growth rates on 5 and 10 days were 2.6×104 and 
0.73×104 CFU/mL, respectively (Figure 1A). Moreover, 
this bacterium had the best growth rate at 35°C and the 
highest light absorption at this temperature was 0.35. 
The lowest growth rate was observed at 25°C and was 
0.21. As shown in, Figure 1B there was a significant dif-
ference in the maximum bacterial growth between 25-
35°C (P<0.05).
Effects of different concentrations of lead metal 
on the growth of B. subtilis bacteria
As shown in Figure 2, there was no significant change 
in the bacterial growth at the lead concentration range 
of 20-200 mg/L. However, at lead concentrations of 300 
and 400 mg/L, the bacterial growth rate significantly de-
creased compared to the control (P<0.001).
Effects of different concentrations of lead metal 
on the activity of laccase enzyme in B. subtilis
The activity of the laccase enzyme was evaluated in 
a safe dose range of lead (20-200 mg/L). As shown in 
Figure 3, with increasing lead concentration (within the 
concentration range mentioned above), the activity of 
the laccase enzyme decreased in a concentration dose-
manner, and this decrease was significant at concentra-
tions of 80 and 160 mg/L (P<0.001). Effect of various 
copper sulfate (CuSO4) concentrations on the production 
of laccase enzymes.
Our findings showed that there was a significant differ -
ence in the activity level of laccase enzyme in 0.2 mM 
of copper sulfate compared to the control (P<0.001). 
Therefore, this amount (0.2 mM) of copper sulfate was 
chosen as the optimum concentration for the study of 
laccase enzyme activity (Figure 4) (P<0.001).

Discussion 
The temperature is an effective factor for inducing and/
or inhibiting enzymatic reactions participating in bacte-
rial growth [19-20]. In the current study, the reduction 
of bacterial growth rate at 40°C can be due to the loss of 
metabolic activity of the cell, and subsequent delay in the 
bacterial division. In the study of Shukur et al. 35°C was 
reported as the optimal temperature for the growth of B. 
Subtilis, and this is in agreement with our findings [21]. 
However, in another study, the highest activity of the lac-
case in B. subtilis WD 23 was observed at 25°C [22].
Bacillus species were identified as the most abundant 
gram-positive bacteria in the soil and were used for the 
study of laccase enzyme activity under optimum condi-
tions. Meanwhile, copper is one of the most important 
factors affecting the production and activity of laccase 
enzyme. In the present study, the optimum concentration 
of copper to induce laccase activity was determined to 
be 0.2 mM. In line with our findings, a similar study on the effect of different concentrations of copper sulfate on 
the growth of B. subtilis WPI showed that 0.2 mM of this 
compound was chosen as the optimum concentration for 
stimulating laccase enzyme activity [23].
Moreover, Shukur et al. in their study on Bacillus B16 
showed that 0.2 Mm of copper sulfate could stimulate 
the production of spore laccase enzyme and increase its 
amount to 6.6 Unit/mL [21]. Regardless of the bacterial 
species, the laccase enzyme appears to have kinetically 
similar responses to copper, which may be due to the 
structural similarity of the enzyme in different species 
of B. subtilis bacteria, and this plays an important role 
in the degradation of aromatic pollutants in petroleum 
products [24].
Based on the results of Logascus et al. this bacterium 
has a relative resistance to Pb exposure [25]. Our find-
ings demonstrated that there was no significant decrease 
in the growth of this bacterium at the concentration range 
of 20-200 mg/L. The resistance of B. subtilis bacteria to 
Pb exposure in the abovementioned concentration range 
may be attributed to the collaboration of PbrA transfer 
protein and PbB phosphatase enzyme, which increases 
the resistance of this bacterium to Pb exposure [26]. This 
can lead to the formation of Pb-resistant species in the 
ecosystem. Concerning this, Zhang et al. showed that 
Pb-resistant strains in Pb-contaminated soils increased 
compared to uncontaminated soils [27]. However, bac-
terial growth significantly reduced at Pb concentrations 
higher than 200 mg/L, which may be attributed to sud-
den shock and lack of sufficient opportunity to adapt to 
Pb exposure at high concentrations. Laccase is a poly-
phenol oxidase containing several copper atoms [28].Lead concentration (mg/l)Growgh (Absorbance)

Conclusion
The results of this study indicated that heavy Pb metal 
at concentrations above 20 mg/L had a decreasing trend 
on the activity of laccase enzymes in B. subtilis WPI, and 
increasing Pb concentration to 160 mg/L, laccase activ-
ity rate was reduced by half in the samples compared to 
the controls. Therefore, releasing these metals into the 
industrial wastewater, such as paper mills, which is a 
main source of B. subtilis WPI, will not only eliminate 
this strain in the ecosystem but also reduces laccase en-
zyme activity causing the sustainability of other pollut-
ants in the environment. 
One of the most important limitations of this study was 
the preparation of B. subtilis WPI.
