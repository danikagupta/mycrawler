ABSTRACT  30 
In recent decades, increasing attention has been directed toward the effects of bisphenol A 31 
(BPA) as an environmental pollutant, primarily due to its demonstrated endocrine -disruptive 32 
effects. A growing body of evidence indicates that many BPA derivatives also exhibit endocrine 33 
activity and other adverse biological properties. A review of the published literature was 34 
performed to identify BPA degradation intermediates resulting from chemical degradation 35 
processes of BPA, as well as BPA's associated co -pollutants. Products of biological metabolism 36 
were not included in this study. Seventy -nine chemicals were identified. Of these chemicals, a 37 
subset - those containing two 6 -membered aromatic rings connected b y a central ring -linking 38 
carbon - was identified, and a further literature review was conducted to identify demonstrated 39 
biological effects associated with the chemicals in this subset. The objectives of this review were 40 
to assess the potential risks to hu man and environmental health associated with BPA derivatives, 41 
characterize our current understanding of BPA's degradation intermediates and co -pollutants, 42 
and aid in the identification of compounds of interest that have received insufficient scrutiny.  43

1. Introduction  47 
The endocrine activity of Bisphenol A (BPA) has long been known (Dodds & Lawson, 1936) and has 48 
been examined by an extensive body of research (Mattison et al., 2014; Peretz et al., 2014). As the 49 
prevalence of BPA -based plastics and epoxies has increased in recent decades, so have concerns 50 
regarding human and environmental exposure, leading BPA to be regarded as a th reat to human and 51 
environmental health.  52 
BPA is introduced into the environment through numerous pathways, such as wastewater treatment 53 
plant effluents, industrial discharge and landfill leachate (Corrales et al., 2015). BPA is concentrated in 54 
wastewater -treatment biosolids, which are dispersed on agricultural land as a supplement or alternative 55 
to conventional fertilizers (Langdon et al., 2010). Environmental exposure to BPA is widespread in 56 
soil, groundwater, surface water, and sediments ( Zhu and Zuo, 201 3; Careghini et al., 2015).   57 
In recent years, attention has been increasingly turned toward the intermediates of BPA degradation 58 
through biological, chemical and photochemical processes. BPA's metabolites, chemical degradation 59 
intermediates and co -polluta nts have increasingly been investigated as potential endocrine disruptors, 60 
genotoxins and toxicants. A thorough reading of this research will facilitate a more holistic 61 
understanding of the risks associated with the use of BPA.  62 
This work identifies the maj or BPA degradation intermediates resulting from chemical and 63 
photochemical processes described in the literature, as well as co -pollutants, such as impurities found 64 
in commercial BPA stock. It further reviews published works investigating the biological ef fects of 65 
these chemicals, including endocrine activity, cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. The 66 
current work deals with biological , especially estrogen -related,  activ ity of BPA analogs and derivatives 67 
bearing two aromatic 6 -membered rings conne cted by a single ring -linking carbon. Though not further 68 4 
examined in this review, many other cleavage, addition and rearrangement products of BPA 69 
transformations exhibit endocrine activity and other biological effects. Products of environmental 70 
biological degradation and animal metabolism are outside the scope of this review, but are discussed in 71 
the cases of chemical species that result from both biological and abiotic processes. Table S1 72 
summarizes BPA degradation products and intermediates generated thro ugh chemical pathways 73 
identified in the published literature, impurities, and co -pollutants  analogous derivatives  identified in 74 
several studies examining impurities in commercially available BPA. It also lists the publish ed articles 75 
that identify these com pounds as BPA derivatives.  76 
1.1 Transformation Pathways  77 
Predominant abiotic pathways for BPA degradation include photochemical and other chemical 78 
processes. The greater share of the published research focuses on methods for inducing degradation of 79 
BPA and other organic pollutants in the treatment of wastewater or drinking water. A number of 80 
studies also describe naturally occurring degradation pathways and inadvertent transformations 81 
occurring in drinking water treatment processes. In wastewater treatment, provisions for the induced 82 
degradation of organic pollut ants are desirable, as a means of eliminating harmful chemicals before 83 
they are released into the environment. While the objective of any method for the treatment of organic 84 
pollutants should be complete mineralization or transformation into harmless organ ic species, stable 85 
intermediates may form. Recent years have seen an increased awareness of degradation intermediates 86 
as secondary pollutants. Traditionally, metrics of success have focused on the disappearance of primary 87 
pollutants. As a result, preventin g or limiting the formation of organic intermediates, which may be 88 
more harmful than primary pollutants, has received relatively limited attention. 89 5

26 
Advanced oxidation processes have been the main focus of recent research into the removal of organic 90 
pollutants in wastewater treatment. Recent works have studied the effects of photocatalysts such as 91 
bismuth vanadate (BiVO 4)  (Kanigaridou et al, 2017), cerium -zinc oxide (Ce -ZnO) (Bechambi et al., 92 
2016), BiOI (Chang et al., 2013) and sodium bismuthate (Na BiO 3) (Ding et al., 2016) on the 93 
degradation of organic pollutants. Catalytic effects of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) have been the focus of 94 
earlier and ongoing research into inorganic photocatalysts for the degradation of BPA (Fukahori et al., 95 
2003; Watanabe e t al., 2003; Torres -Palma, 2010; Jia et al., 2012; Kondrakov et al., 2014; da Silva et 96 
al., 2014). In addition to photocatalysts, Fenton's reagent may be used to oxidize organic contaminants 97 
in wastewater. Fenton and photo -Fenton reactions have been the fo cus of numerous BPA remediation 98 
studies (Molkenthin et al., 2013; Poerschmann et al., 2010; Rodriguez et al., 2010; Torres et al., 2007; 99 
Torres -Palma, 2010) and many organic intermediates have been identified in these works.  100 
Real-world deployment of techn ologies for the treatment of organic pollutants varies substantially from 101 
place to place, and in many cases may be absent. Many of the methods for the photocatalytic treatment 102 
of organic pollutants discussed in the literature represent wastewater -treatment  technologies that are 103 
primarily aspirational in nature  and have not been applied in  real wastewater treatment processes . 104 
Nevertheless, it can be assumed that the next generation of wastewater treatment technologies is 105 
represented in current and recent res earch. Therefore, a more comprehensive understanding of the 106 
implications of using these technologies in advance of their further development or deployment can 107 
lead to better -informed decisions regarding the environmental benefits and costs associated with their 108 
use.  109 
In addition to processes applied to treat pollutants prior to their discharge into the environment, natural 110 
photochemical transformations in surface waters have been modeled experimentally (Calza et al., 2014; 111 
Zepp et al., 1985). Photochemical processes are believed to account for a substantial portion of BPA 112 27 
degradation in the natural environment. Liu and colleagues (2009, 2010) investigated the solar 113 
photodegradation of BPA in surface waters, demonstrating the formation of chlorinated intermed iates. 114 
Tercero Espinoza and colleages (2007) examined the degradation of BPA under simulated solar UV 115 
light. Several other studies have examined the effects of humic substances and dissolved organic matter 116 
as natural photosensitizers in the degradation of BPA and other phenolic compounds (Calza et al., 117 
2014; Peng et al., 2006; Zhan et al., 2006). While substantial research has been conducted into the 118 
environmental degradation of BPA, studies identifying degradation intermediates are limited, and so 119 
our know ledge of these chemicals is incomplete.  120 
In the treatment of drinking water, the objectives behind technologies currently in use are often 121 
sterilization and odor control, rather than detoxification of trace organic pollutants. Treatment with 122 
sodium hypochl orite (NaClO) is perhaps the most commonly deployed approach to meeting these 123 
objectives. NaClO reacts with BPA, which may be introduced to drinking water supplies through 124 
leaching from epoxy coatings in water pipes and water storage tanks (Liang et al., 2 015). In wastepaper 125 
recycling, BPA - which occurs as a developer used in thermal printed papers  (Shi, 2012)  - comes in 126 
contact with NaClO, which is used as a bleaching agent. Products of reactions between NaClO and 127 
BPA have been found in effluents from pap er recycling facilities (Fukazawa et al., 2001).  128 
Reactions between BPA and NaClO proceed through several chlorinated BPA substitution 129 
intermediates to eventual cleavage products (Li et al., 2016; Tabata et al., 2004). The degree of BPA 130 
chlorination and de gradation by NaClO is a function of both NaClO concentration and reaction time 131 
(Tabata et al., 2004). In real -world processes, the reaction sequence does not fully proceed to the 132 
cleavage step. Experimental evidence and water analysis have demonstrated tha t degradation of BPA 133 
by NaClO results in chlorinated bisphenol products and chlorinated phenolic cleavage products (Li et 134 
al., 2016).  135 28 
1.2 BPA Impurities  136 
Most risk assessments examining BPA's biological effects have been conducted using laboratory grade 137 
BPA , with 99+% purity. Industrial grade BPA more typically has a stated purity of 97 -98% (Terasaki 138 
et al., 2004). Several analytical studies have examined industrial grade BPA, performing both 139 
quantitative and qualitative determination of the impurities (Godí nez et al., 2011; Nowakowska et al., 140 
1996; Terasaki et al., 2004). Limited data is available regarding the extent to which these impurities 141 
remain intact through polymerization and other chemical processes involved in producing BPA -based 142 
materials. It is p robable that like BPA, some of these species may leach out of the finished materials, 143 
allowing for both human and environmental exposure.  144 
1.3 Bio -effects of BPA Derivatives  145 
BPA's estrogenic effects are the primary area of concern regarding its biological activity. As a result, 146 
research into the biological effects of BPA derivatives most frequently examines estrogenic activity, 147 
with several studies screening large numbers of chemicals for such activity using in vitro  assays 148 
(Kitamura et al., 2005; Terasaki et al, 2005). Numerous in vivo  studies have also examined smaller 149 
numbers of BPA derivatives, demonstrating estrogenic and other adverse effects in animals ( Hasegawa 150 
et al., 2007; Kalasekar et al., 2015; Molins -Delgado et al., 2016; Nakazawa et al., 2009 ; Qiu et al., 151 
2018 ). Due to structural similarities between BPA and bisphenol derivatives, many of the derivatives 152 
have been also found to be estrogen agonists.  153 
A substantial share of the research into biological effects of BPA derivatives focuses on chlori nated 154 
bisphenols. Much of the interest in this area stems from the use of chlorinated and brominated 155 
bisphenols as flame retardants. Several of these chemicals have been found to exhibit biological 156 
activity not observed in BPA, such as thyroid hormonal act ivity ( Butt & Stapleton, 2013; Fukazawa et 157 29 
al., 2002; Letcher & Chu, 2010; Malkoske et al., 2016 ; Luo  et al., 2016; Yamauchi & Ishihara, 2006 ). 158 
Research conducted to -date has clearly demonstrated that the adverse biological effects associated with 159 
BPA are not limited to the effects of BPA itself. Rather, co -pollutants and BPA derivatives resulting 160 
from degradation processes pose substantial environmental and health risks. At this time, many 161 
chemicals structurally analogous to BPA have been subjected to a le vel of scrutiny insufficient to fully 162 
assess risk. Some chemicals remain altogether untested, and should be the focus of future research.  163 
2. Chlorinated BPA Derivatives  164 
2.1. Sources of Chlorinated BPA Derivatives  165 
Chlorinated BPA derivatives have been show n to form in the presence of NaClO (Hu et al., 2002), and 166 
several studies include detailed kinetic analyses of NaClO -induced chlorination processes (Gallard et 167 
al., 2004; Lane, et al., 2015). Chlorination by NaClO is understood to proceed in a stepwise fas hion in 168 
the following order: BPA → 2-chloro -4,4'-isopropylidenediphenol  (3-ClBPA) → 4,4' -(1- 169 
methylethylidene)bis[2 -chlorophenol] ( 3,3'-diClBPA) & 2,6 -dichloro -4-[1-(4-hydroxyphenyl) -1- 170 
methylethyl]phenol (3,5 -diClBPA) → 2,6-dichloro -4-[1-(3-chloro -4-hydroxyphenyl) -1- 171 
methylethyl]phenol (3,3',5 -triClBPA) → 4,4'-(1-methylethylidene)bis[2,6 -dichlorophenol] (TCBPA) 172 
(Li et al., 2016). This sequence is followed by a cleavage reaction with hypochlorite (ClO-), resulting in 173 
chlor inated monoaromatic phenolic products. Experimental evidence (Tabata et al., 2004) and the 174 
prevalence of multiple chlorinated bisphenol compounds in treated drinking water (Fan et al., 2013) 175 
indicate that this pathway generally does not progress to complet ion outside of carefully controlled 176 
laboratory conditions, but rather results in residual concentrations of multiple chlorinated intermediates 177 
(Tabata et al., 2004). Chlorinated BPA derivatives found in sewage sludge (Song et al., 2014b) are 178 
likely evidenc e of chlorination occurring in municipal water treatment processes, in which NaClO is 179 30 
used as a disinfectant.  180 
Experimental evidence indicates that BPA also undergoes natural photo -chlorination reactions in the 181 
presence of sunlight in surface waters (Liu e t al., 2009; Liu et al., 2010). Chlorinated BPA products, 182 
whether resulting from natural or induced processes, have been identified in the environment in surface 183 
waters (Yin et al., 2011) and sediment (Weiss et al., 2015).  184 
In addition to being a product of  BPA chemical transformation, TCBPA is also a widely used flame 185 
retardant. Introduction of TCBPA into the environment arises from both the manufacture or 186 
degradation of TCBPA treated products and the degradation of BPA. The current work includes 187 
discussion  of TCBPA without further examination of the relative significance of the various 188 
environmental exposure pathways. The reader should bear in mind that the disproportionate attention 189 
paid to TCBPA in the literature relative to the other chlorinated BPA prod ucts results largely from the 190 
fact that TCBPA is a widely used industrial chemical. Given the wide range of demonstrated endocrine 191 
effects associated with TCBPA, the relatively limited body of research regarding the other chlorinated 192 
BPA derivatives likely  represents an incomplete assessment of the biological and environmental 193 
hazards associated with chlorinated bisphenols, indicating a need for more research focused on this 194 
area.  195 
3-ClBPA and 3,3' -diClBPA were shown to form in saline solutions in the prese nce of Fe(III) and fulvic 196 
acid in experiments designed to model reactions of BPA in sunlight in natural seawater (Liu et al., 197 
2009). The rate of formation of chlorinated derivatives was substantially higher in the presence of both 198 
fulvic acid and Fe(III) t han rates observed with either Fe(III) or fulvic acid alone, indicating a 199 
combined effect likely resulting from an Fe(III) -fulvic acid complex. Chlorination was also shown to 200 
occur in natural seawater. Chlorinated derivatives formed at concentrations appro ximately three orders 201 31 
of magnitude below the BPA concentration, and concentrations tended to either decay or drop off after 202 
reaching a maximum, indicating that 3 -ClBPA and 3,3' -diClBPA are able to undergo additional photo - 203 
transformation in seawater. A sepa rate study (Liu et al., 2010) found that both nitrate and citric acid - 204 
used experimentally as a model for dissolved organic matter (DOM) - significantly suppressed the 205 
formation of both 3 -ClBPA and 3,3' -diClBPA. However, the previous experiments in natura l seawater 206 
suggest that these inhibitory effects may be minimal at environmental concentrations of nitrate and 207 
DOM.  208 
2.2. Bioeffects of Chlorinated BPA Derivatives  209 
2.2.1. Estrogenic Activity of Chlorinated BPA Derivatives  210 
The endocrine -disruptive properties  of chlorinated BPA products began receiving attention as early as 211 
2002, with two in vitro studies. Fukazawa et al., (2002) examined estrogenic activity of the chlorinated 212 
BPA products with an agonist assay using the yeast two -hybrid system. 3 -ClBPA, 3,3' -diClBPA, 3,5 - 213 
diClBPA, 3,3',5 -triClBPA and TCBPA were all found to exhibit estrogenic activity stronger than that 214 
of BPA. The most potent was 3,3' -diClBPA, with activity 38 times greater than that of BPA. It was also 215 
found that 3,3',5 -triClBPA and TCBPA wer e resistant to biodegradation by an activated -sludge 216 
pathway, which is sometimes a key step in the decontamination of paper processing effluent, 217 
suggesting a potential for greater environmental exposure and persistence. In in vitro  experiments with 218 
human b reast carcinoma MCF7 cells, Kuruto -Niwa et al. (2002) demonstrated that 3 -ClBPA and 3,3' - 219 
diClBPA had estrogenicities comparable to that of BPA at significantly lower concentrations. 3 - 220 
ClBPA, 3,3' -diClBPA and 3,3',5 -triClBPA were shown to strongly stimulate  cancer cell proliferation, 221 
despite the enhanced cytotoxicity of chlorinated BPAs. These findings were supported by work using 222 
the MCF7 cell line, which found that 3 -ClBPA stimulated cell proliferation at a rate comparable to that 223 32 
of BPA, while 3,3',5 -triClBPA and a mixture of 3,3' -diClBPA and 3,5 -diClBPA both stimulated 224 
growth at a significantly higher rate than BPA (Liu et al., 2005). Additionally, it was found that a 225 
sample of BPA solution treated with 7 ppm NaClO stimulated greater cell proliferation th an the 226 
untreated BPA solution, indicating that transformations occurring in water treatment processes may 227 
increase the endocrine activity of BPA.  228 
Zebrafish are often used as a model species in the study of genetics and endocrine system behavior. 229 
Several s tudies have examined estrogenic effects of chlorinated BPA derivatives in zebrafish. Song and 230 
colleagues (2014a) examined estrogenic effects using a vitellogenin (VTG) assay. VTG is a protein 231 
used as a biomarker of estrogen exposure in vertebrates. While V TG levels were elevated in fish 232 
exposed to BPA  (Letcher et al., 2005) , no such change was observed with exposure to TCBPA. 233 
However, TCBPA exposure led to a significant increase in mortality over the control population in 234 
adult fish at concentrations at whi ch BPA had no effect. Acute toxicity of TCBPA toward larvae and 235 
embryos was also much higher compared with that of BPA. A separate study using VTG analysis to 236 
measure estrogen agonist activity in Japanese medaka fish found that 3 -ClBPA, and 3,3',5 -triClBPA  237 
had lower estrogenicity than BPA, but that 3,3' -diClBPA was significantly more estrogen active than 238 
BPA, while TCBPA had no measurable estrogen agonist effect (Tabata et al., 2004).  239 
More recently, a competitive -binding assay experiment demonstrated that at 1 μM, both BPA and 240 
TCBPA were effective competitors for estradiol (E2) binding to recombinant zebrafish G protein - 241 
coupled estrogen receptor 1, displacing 62% and 60% of E2 , respectively (Fitzgerald et al., 2015). Both 242 
BPA and TCBPA were shown to disrupt  oocyte maturation in zebrafish, measured by inhibition of 243 
germinal vesicle breakdown at concentrations as low as 5 nM.  244 
Among other estrogenic effects observed in fish, TCBPA was shown in an in vitro  experiment to be a 245 33 
more potent inhibitor of E2 metabolis m in the kidney and liver tissue of lake trout than BPA, reducing 246 
the formation of estrogen metabolites by approximately 80% at 100 μM (Jurgella et al., 2006). In 247 
considering effects within the liver, it should be noted that phenolic endocrine disrupting chemicals 248 
(EDCs) have been found to partition in the liver tissue of fish, such that biologically relevant 249 
concentrations at the site of the tissue may be significantly higher than those found in the organism as a 250 
whole or in the su rrounding aquatic enviro nment. Liu et al. (2011a) measured BPA at 106.7 ng/g dry 251 
weight in the liver of lake carp - approximately three times the concentrations occurring in gill and 252 
muscle tissue. The bioconcentration factor (ratio of BPA concentration in the fish to the surroun ding 253 
aquatic concentration) was 29.  254 
Kitamura et al., (2005) tested the endocrine activity of BPA and 19 related compounds, including 255 
bisphenols B, F, AF and S, tetrabrominated BPA, methylated bisphenols and several other bisphenol 256 
species. An MCF -7 estroge n luciferase reporter assay was used to test estrogenic activity, and showed 257 
that TCBPA was the most estrogenic of all compounds tested, showing significant agonist activity at 258 
10-8 M. This finding is supported by other in vitro  studies showing that TCBPA is more estrogenic than 259 
BPA (Fukazawa et al., 2002; Li et al., 2010; Ruan et al., 2015). However, contradictory evidence is 260 
found in the literature, suggesting that tetra -chlorination of BPA reduces estrogen agonist activity 261 
(Molina -Molina et al., 2013; So ng et al., 2014a). Given the lack of consensus on this point, the effects 262 
of tetrachlorination on the estrogenic activity of BPA derivatives remains a subject of continued 263 
concern.  264 
The estrogenic potential of TCBPA was examined in vivo  using a uterotrophic  assay with 265 
ovariectomized mice, and the estrogenic effect of both BPA and TCBPA was confirmed (Kitamura et 266 
al., 2005). In the in vivo  experiment, TCBPA was found to exhibit somewhat lower estrogenic activity 267 
than BPA. The tendency of TCBPA to show limited  effects on estrogen -driven cell and tissue growth 268 34 
despite high estrogen receptor (ER) affinity could result from the heightened cytotoxicity observed in 269 
chlorinated bisphenols (Mutou et al., 2006b; Terasaki et al., 2011). Effects of cytotoxicity may accou nt 270 
for some of the differences in estrogenicity measured using different methodologies.  271 
Nuclear receptor binding has long been a favored metric for assessing endocrine activity of 272 
xenoestrogens. Due in part to limitations in the sensitivity of current bio analytical techniques, 273 
measurable receptor binding tends to occur at higher concentrations than are biologically or 274 
environmentally relevant - a fact that contributes to the controversy surrounding the assessment of risk 275 
associated with EDCs such as BPA in  real-world biological systems. Watson et al. (2014) and Vinas et 276 
al. (2013) focused on intercellular signaling mechanisms, rather than the more commonly studied 277 
nuclear transcriptional pathways, examining the effects of xenoestrogens on extracellular regu lated 278 
kinases (ERK) at concentrations from 10-7 to 10-15 M. Across this concentration range, BPA, 3 -ClBPA 279 
and 3,3' -diClBPA were found to enhance the effects of E2 on ERK activation in the presence of a 280 
natural E2 concentration, while 3,3',5 -triClBPA deacti vated ERK. Activation is associated with an 281 
increase in intercellular signaling, and deactivation results in suppression of natural signaling. This 282 
work provides strong evidence of low dose effects of BPA and its chlorinated derivatives at 283 
environmentally and biologically relevant concentrations, and may provide insight into the mechanisms 284 
behind non -monotonic dose -response cu rves associated with some EDCs.   285 
Woeste and coworkers (2013) examined the ability of various bisphenols to interfere with the activit y 286 
of the ion -translocating enzyme sarco/endoplasmis reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA). Bisphenols 287 
have been shown to inhibit SERCA activity by binding to the enzyme. TCBPA was found to exhibit 288 
strong inhibitory activity, with an half -maximal inhibitory conc entration (IC 50) 1/25 that of BPA. This 289 
demonstrates TCBPA's ability to interfere with Ca2+ homeostasis, resulting in elevated cytosolic Ca2+ 290 
levels and possibly bringing about apoptosis.  291 35 
2.2.2. Thyroid Hormonal Activity of Chlorinated BPA Derivatives  292 
Multiple studies have demonstrated that chlorinated bisphenols exhibit thyroid hormonal activity. 293 
3,3',5 -triClBPA and TCBPA have been shown to exhibit agonist activity with respect to 3,3’,5 - 294 
triiodothyronine (T 3)  thyroid hormone, as well as antagonist act ivity through competition with T 3 for 295 
binding to thyroid hormone receptor α (TRα) (Terasaki et al., 2011). A GH3 assay used to test thyroid 296 
hormonal activity found that TCBPA induced thyroid hormone (TH) -dependent production of growth 297 
hormone in the range of 10-6 to 10-4 M, indicating agonist activity with respect to a T 3-dependent 298 
biological process. (Kitamura et al., 2005)  299 
A combined in vitro and in vivo  study has demonstrated the effects of chlorinated BPA derivatives in 300 
xenopus laevis  frogs (Kudo & Yam ouchi, 2005). Amphibians are useful to the study of TH disruption, 301 
as THs control amphibian metamorphoses. Chlorinated BPA compounds were shown to bind to 302 
xenopus laevis  transthyretin (TTR) - a transport protein that carries the thyroid hormone thyroxine ( T4) 303 
in serum and cerebrospinal fluid - in competition with T 3. Binding potency was greatest for 3,3',5 - 304 
triClBPA and least for 3 -ClBPA. 3,3',5 -triClBPA’s binding affinity was 160 times greater than that of 305 
BPA, and just slightly less than that of T 3. In xenopus laevis  tadpole experiments, exposure to 3,3',5 - 306 
triClBPA was found to completely inhibit T 3-induced metamorphosis, indicating strong T 3 antagonist 307 
activity. In another study, TCBPA was shown to suppress tail shortening - an indicator of 308 
metamorphosis - in rana rugosa  tadpoles at concentrations from 10-6 to 10-10 M (Goto et al., 2006). 309 
TCBPA also suppressed the T 3-induced apoptosis in tadpole tail muscle that is understood to be 310 
responsible for tail regression, and inhibited hindlimb elongation. An in vitro study  developed a TH - 311 
responsive xenopus laevis  cell line for use in a reporter gene assay (Sugiyama et al., 2005). Known and 312 
suspected thyroid -active compounds were tested for T 3 activity. 3,3',5 -triClBPA exhibited T 3- 313 
antagonist activity at 0.01 -1.0 μM. At concentrations from 0.01 to 10.0 μM, TCBPA exhibited T 3-like 314 36 
agonist activity in cells incubated without T 3. 315 
TCBPA was shown to inhibit thyroid hormone sulfotransferase activity in an in vitro  assay using a 3,3' - 316 
diiodothyronine substrate in human li ver cytosol, with an IC 50 value of 340 nM (Butt & Stapleton, 317 
2013). Thyroid hormone sulfonation - just one of multiple potential mechanisms for thyroid hormone 318 
disruption - aids the regulation of thyroid hormones by the formation of a biologically inactiva ted 319 
thyroid hormone. The sulfated hormone is deactivated by a subsequent deiodination. Inhibition of this 320 
process by TCBPA demonstrates TCBPA's ability to interfere with thyroid hormone regulation.  321 
Competitive binding to TTR is a mechanism by which halogen ated phenolic compounds appear to 322 
affect TH homeostasis. Compounds halogenated in the ortho positions with respect to hydroxyl groups 323 
on two phenolic rings, such as 3,3',5 -triClBPA, have been shown to preferentially bind to TTR in 324 
amphibians (Yamauchi & Is hihara, 2006). In humans, preferential binding occurs when the halogens 325 
occupy both ortho positions on two rings, as is the case in TCBPA (Kudo & Yamauchi, 2005; Kudo et 326 
al., 2006).  327 
Electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI -MS) was used to show that TCBPA binds to human 328 
and bovine serum albumin (Luo, et al., 2016). Among other functions, serum albumin functions as a 329 
transport protein for thyroid hormones, and may account for a portion of chlorinated -bisphenol 330 
transport in the human body.  331 
2.2.3. Metab olic and Obesogenic Effects of Chlorinated BPA Derivatives  332 
Endocrine disruptors, including chlorinated organic pollutants, have been shown to act as obesogens in 333 
animals (Cock and van de Bor, 2014; Lee et al., 2014). Several pathways involving peroxisome 334 
proliferator -activated receptors (PPARs) - a class of nuclear receptors that regulate the expression of 335 37 
genes - have been implicated in obesogenic effects. While some of the possible mechanisms require 336 
ongoing exposure to stimulate sustained lipid mobilizat ion, in the case of the PPARγ pathway, early 337 
limited -duration exposure to EDCs has been shown to cause effects later in life (Cock and van de Bor, 338 
2014). An in vivo study demonstrated that TCBPA is readily absorbed during early stages of zebrafish 339 
larval d evelopment, and stimulates late -onset lipid accumulation in zebrafish exposed to concentrations 340 
of 100 nM early in development (Riu et al., 2014). TCBPA was shown to activate zebrafish PPARγ, 341 
offering a possible mechanistic explanation for the in vivo  results.  342 
Another zebrafish study determined that exposure of larvae to 1 nM TCBPA induced faster yolk 343 
absorption (Kalasekar et al., 2015). While this effect was not definitively attributable to PPARγ 344 
activation, it provides evidence of an increase in metaboli c activity early in life, a factor associated 345 
with obesogenic effects. In addition to the in vivo  evidence of metabolic effects, TCBPA was shown to 346 
induce adipogenesis in 3T3 -Li cells in an i n-vitro  experiment, demonstrating that TCBPA is a ligand 347 
and agon ist for PPARγ in human cells (Riu et al., 2011).  348 
Activation of PPARγ may have additional developmental implications beyond obesogenic effects. A 349 
rodent study (Wan Ibrahim et al., 2013) demonstrated that prenatal exposure to PPARγ -activating 350 
EDCs affects ge ne expression in neonatal brain tissue. Further investigation into developmental effects 351 
of chlorinated BPA derivatives by this pathway is warranted.  352 
2.2.4. Other Endocrine -Disruptive Effects of Chlorinated BPA Derivatives  353 
Chlorinated bisphenols have been shown to interact with retinoid X receptor (RXR) in a two -hybrid 354 
yeast assay (Li et al., 2016). RXRs play a role in regulating a wide range of biological processes, 355 
including cell growth, differentiation, metabolism, morphogenesis and embryonic development  (Li et 356 
al., 2016; Tanaka and De Luca, 2009). Chlorination of BPA by NaClO led to a significant increase in 357 38 
RXRβ antagonist activity with increasing chlorination of BPA derivatives. A proposed mechanism for 358 
the degradation of BPA by NaClO proceeds stepwise  from monochlorinated products up to TCBPA 359 
and eventual cleavage to form 2,4,6 -trichlorophenol (TCP), w ith exposure time and initial Cl O- 360 
concentration determining the extent to which this pathway proceeds (Li et al., 2016) . TCP was shown 361 
to be the most po tent RXRβ antagonist. TCBPA's and TCP's RXRβ antagonist activities were 7.09 and 362 
79.31 times that of BPA, respectively, indicating that more thorough treatment with NaClO may 363 
significantly increase RXRβ antagonist activity of BPA in water treatment context s by producing more 364 
TCP (Li et al., 2016) .  365 
TCBPA has been shown to exhibit strong progesterone -receptor antagonist effects in a bio -assay using 366 
a yeast strain transfected with a human progesterone response element. Effects were observable at 367 
concentration s as low as 10-8 M (Li et al., 2010). TCBPA was also found to be a weak -to-moderate 368 
human pregnane X agonist in a HeLa reporter bioassay, showing a greater potency in its ability to 369 
activate transcription via human pregnane E receptor than BPA (Molina -Moli na 2013).  370 
Published reports indicate either that TCBPA is not androgenic or that it is weakly androgenic. Several 371 
investigations into androgenic activity have found no androgen agonist effects (Kitamura et al., 2005; 372 
Molina -Molina et al., 2013; Sun et al. , 2006). There is some evidence that TCBPA exhibits androgen 373 
antagonist properties (Li et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2006), but this is contradicted by research that has 374 
concluded that no such properties are present (Kitamura et al., 2005; Molina -Molina et al. , 2013). 375 
Overall, it appears that TCBPA is at least significantly less anti -androgenic than BPA, which has been 376 
shown to be a strong androgen antagonist (Kitamura et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2006).  377 
2.3. Chlorinated BPA Derivatives in Humans  378 
Mono, di and tri -chlorinated derivatives of BPA have been detected in human adipose tissue in women, 379 39 
with dichloro -BPA (either 3,3' -diClBPA or 3,5 -diClBPA) found in 80% of samples, constituting an 380 
average of 94.6% of total chlorinated BPA detected. The mean concentration o f dichloro -BPA detected 381 
was 9.21 ng/g - nearly twice the mean concentration of BPA. (Fernandez et al., 2007). Similar results 382 
were obtained from an analysis of adipose tissue in children, in which dichloro -BPA was found in 99% 383 
of samples, and was the most abundant of the chlorinated derivatives, although in children its mean 384 
concentration was somewhat lower than in adult women (Olea et al., 2008). Drinking water analyses 385 
have shown that dichloro -BPA represents a low percentage of overall chlorinated BPA der ivatives (Fan 386 
et al., 2013), though data in this area are limited. Given that drinking water is thought to be the major 387 
source of exposure to chlorinated BPAs (Migeot et al., 2013), the biological concentrations suggest that 388 
dichloro -BPA's tendency to part ition in adipose tissue is greater than that of BPA.  389 
The possibility of maternal transfer of BPA and its chlorinated derivatives to newborns was raised by 390 
research showing that these chemicals are present in human colostrum - the nutrient and antibody -rich 391 
milk produced around the time of childbirth. 3,5 -diClBPA was found in 100% of colostrum samples 392 
taken from 21 women. Mean concentrations of 3,3' -diClBPA and 3,5 -diClBPA were 1.87 and 1.56 393 
ng/ml, respectively, and were comparable to that of BPA (Migeot et al., 2013). BPA, and mono, di and 394 
trichlorinated derivatives were also detected in human placenta tissue (Jimenez -Diaz et al., 2010). BPA 395 
and dichloro -BPA were found in concentrations from 5.7 -22.2 ng/g and 12.7 -58.8 ng/g, respectively. 396 
BPA was detected in  20.4% of samples, whereas the 3 chlorinated derivatives were each found in 397 
approximately 50% of samples. In light of the demonstrated increase in endocrine activity with 398 
chlorination, the prevalence and abundance of the chlorinated derivatives suggest tha t neonatal and 399 
postnatal exposure to these chemicals may pose a greater risk to health and development than that 400 
posed by BPA. Evidence of fetal or neonatal exposure is particularly concerning given the 401 
demonstrated effects of short -term early exposure on PPAR mediated processes.   402 40 
More recently, embryonic exposure to BPA and chlorinated BPAs was examined. The first 8 weeks of 403 
pregnancy are a crucial period in the development of the nervous and circulatory systems and the heart, 404 
so exposure to toxins and mu tagens during this period can cause significant developmental 405 
abnormalities. During the first 8 gestational weeks, the embryo is housed in the chorionic villi, which 406 
covers the decidual membrane. These tissues serve as the interface between the mother and embryo 407 
during this stage of gestation. Chen and colleagues (2016) determined BPA and its chlorinated 408 
derivatives in decidua and chorionic villi samples collected from terminated pregnancies. 3 -ClBPA, 409 
dichloro -BPA (a mixture of 3,3' -diClBPA and 3,5 -diClBPA) , 3,3',5 -triClBPA and TCBPA were all 410 
detected, with 3 -ClBPA and dichloro -BPA found in 76% and 72% of samples, respectively. In decidua, 411 
mean concentrations of 3 -ClBPA (0.46 ng/g dw) and dichloro -BPA (0.43 ng/g dw) were highest among 412 
the chlorinated derivat ives, but were below that of BPA (1.30 ng/g dw). In chorionic villi samples, 413 
frequency of occurrence was comparable, and mean concentrations of BPA, 3 -ClBPA and dichloro - 414 
BPA were found to be 11.86, 3.70 and 4.30 ng/g dw, respectively. On the basis of a sta tistical analysis 415 
of correlations between analyte concentrations in placenta and chorionic villi samples, the researchers 416 
concluded that maternal transfer efficiency is higher for 3 -ClBPA and dichloro -BPA than for BPA. 417 
Binding to TTR may offer a mechanisti c pathway for transfer and accumulation in the embryo.  418 
Chlorinated BPA derivatives have also been detected in human urine. Mono, di and trichloro -BPA 419 
were determined at mean concentrations of 0.055, 0.048 and 0.047 ng/ml, significantly lower than the 420 
mean BPA concentration of 0.701 ng/ml (Liao and Kannan, 2012 ).  421 
2.4. Effects of Further Photodegradation of Chlorinated Bisphenols  422 
Mutou and colleagues (2008) UV -irradiated chlorinated derivatives of BPA to assess the effects of 423 
photo -transformation on the chemicals' potential to induce or inhibit apoptosis. When J urkat human 424 41 
lymphoma cells were exposed to UVB or UVC -irradiated solutions of 50 μM 3 -ClBPA, 3,3' -diClBPA 425 
and 3,3',5 -triClBPA, cell viability was significantly decreased, indicating increased cytotoxicity in 426 
relation to non -irradiated solutions. Further ir radiation reduced cytotoxicity. Induction of apoptosis was 427 
determined by analysis of DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation. Chromatin condensation is 428 
a process by which chromatin is consolidated into chromosomes, and occurs in the prophase stage of 429 
cell mitosis. When Jurkat cells were exposed to 50 μM irradiated solutions of 3,3' -diClBPA, UVB and 430 
UVC -irradiated solutions induced chromatin condensation, while a UVA -irradiated solution and the 431 
non-irradiated 3,3' -diClBPA control did not. The UVB -irradi ated solution also induced DNA 432 
fragmentation. These results are indicators that the species irradiated with UVB and UVC generated 433 
products that induced apoptosis. A biphasic relationship was observed between radiation exposure and 434 
apoptosis indicators, wit h effects initially increasing, then decreasing with increasing irradiation. This 435 
was attributed to chemical changes with continued irradiation, including loss of chlorine from the 436 
phenolic ring. In a prior work, irradiation of 3 -ClBPA and 3,3' -diClBPA wit h UVB was shown to 437 
induce dissociation of chlorine, bringing about conversion to 4,4' -(1-methylethylidene)bis[1,2 - 438 
benzenediol] (BPA dicatechol) and 4 -[1-(4-hydroxyphenyl) -1-methylethyl] -1,2-benzenediol (BPA 439 
catechol), and further irradiation resulted in ev entual decomposition of these products (Mutou et al.; 440 
2006b). The initial increase in cytotoxicity with irradiation can be explained in part by the production 441 
of the intermediate BPA catechol, which has been shown to be highly cytotoxic (Nakagawa and 442 
Suzuk i, 2001). UVB irradiation of 3,3' -diClBPA was shown to decrease estrogen agonist activity in a 443 
yeast two -hybrid assay in proportion to the release of chlorine (Mutou et al., 2006a).  444 
Modification of histone proteins has been associated with the initiation a nd promotion of cancer. 445 
Phosphorylation of H2AX, a component of the protein histone H2A, occurs after the formation of 446 
double -stranded breaks in DNA (Rogakou et al., 1998). A culture of human keratinocyte skin cells 447 42 
treated with UVB -irradiated 3,3' -diClBPA  showed evidence of phosphorylated H2AX, indicating 448 
double -stranded DNA breaks (Ibuki et al., 2008). No such effect was observed in untreated cells or 449 
cells treated with irradiated BPA. A dose -dependent relationship was observed between UVB 450 
irradiation of 3,3'-diClBPA and foci of phosphorylated H2AX. The increase in 3,3' -diClBPA's capacity 451 
for inducing DNA breaks was attributed to formation of BPA catechol.  452 
3. Quinones and Hydroxylated Derivatives of BPA  453 
3.1. Sources of Quinones and Hydroxylated Derivatives  of BPA  454 
Hydroxylated derivatives of BPA are common to a variety of degradation pathways, including 455 
chemical (Deborde et al., 2008; Ding et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2011b; Tay et al., 2012), photochemical 456 
(da Silva et al., 2014; Ding et al., 2016; Kanigaridou  et al., 2017; Kondrakov et al., 2014; Liu et al., 457 
2010; Mutou et al., 2006b) and sonochemical processes (Torres et al., 2007; Torres -Palma, 2010). In 458 
addition to being identified as a BPA photodegradation product, BPA catechol has been shown to form 459 
from BPA through metabolic pathways in animal (Nakagawa & Suzuki, 2001) and human (Ye et al., 460 
2011) hepatocytes.  461 
Quinone derivatives of BPA result from photochemical processes (da Silva et al., 2014; Kondrakov et 462 
al., 2014;) and BPA ozonation pathways (Deborde et al., 2008.)  463 
3.2. Bioeffects of Quinones and Hydroxylated Derivatives of BPA  464 
BPA catechol exhibits cytotoxic properties (Mutou et al., 2006b), and in animal cells is tranformed to 465 
4-[1-(4-hydroxyphenyl) -1-methylethyl] -3,5-cyclohexadiene -1,2-dione (BPA 3 ,4-quinone), a DNA - 466 
reactive species that has been shown to form DNA adducts in vitro  and in vivo (Atkinson & Roy, 467 
1995a; Atkinson & Roy, 1995b; Edmonds et al., 2004; Qui et al., 2004). The conversion of BPA 468 43 
catechol to BPA 3,4 -quinone in vivo is a crucial step in a proposed mechanism for cancer initiation 469 
induced by BPA metabolism. Briefly, BPA metabolism results in the production of BPA catechol, 470 
which is converted to BPA 3,4 -quinone by an oxidative process. The electrophilic BPA 3,4 -quinone 471 
reacts with DN A to form depurinating adducts, Depurination of the adducts results in apurinic sites on 472 
the DNA. If not repaired, these altered segements of DNA could be replicated, resulting in gene 473 
mutations, possibly leading to cancer initiation (Cavalieri & Rogan, 20 10). Analytical (Edmonds et al., 474 
2004) and computational (Kolsek et al., 2012; Kolsek et al., 2013) evidence demonstrates the formation 475 
and depurination of DNA adducts by BPA 3,4 -quinone, and computational analysis indicates that 476 
adduct formation may be me diated by preferential reaction between BPA 3,4 -quinone and scavengers 477 
such as glutathione within the cell (Kolsek et al., 2013). While this pathway is generally understood to 478 
progress from metabolic transformation of BPA, the crucial roles of BPA catechol  and BPA 3,4 - 479 
quinone in the sequence also warrant consideration of exogenous sources of these chemicals, such as 480 
the photochemical transformation of BPA.  481 
DNA damage brought about by BPA 3,4 -quinone may also result from intracellular generation of 482 
reactive  oxygen species  (ROS). In in vitro experiments, BPA 3,4 -quinone was able to convert xanthine 483 
dehydrogenase (XD) - an enzyme associated with the metabolism of purines - to xanthine oxidase (XO) 484 
in rat hepatocytes (Sakuma et al., 2010). Unlike XD, the XO fo rm of the protein is responsible for the 485 
production of ROS. Exposure to BPA 3,4 -quinone was shown to induce oxidative DNA damage, likely 486 
attributable to XO -generated ROS.  487 
Nakagawa & Suzuki (2001) investigated the estrogenicity of BPA catechol and BPA in a competitive 488 
binding assay. BPA catechol and BPA were both found to competitively displace E2 bound to estrogen 489 
receptor α (ERα), though binding potency was 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of the synthetic 490 
estrogen diethylstilbestrol. With an IC 50 value of 5x10-5 M, BPA catechol was found to be slightly less 491 44 
potent than BPA. In an MCF -7 bioassay, BPA catechol was shown to increase cell growth slightly at 492 
concentrations of 10-7 to 10-6 M, at a rate lower than that of BPA, likely due in part to BPA catec hol's 493 
greater cytotoxicity (Nakagawa & Suzuki, 2001). BPA catechol was also found to be less estrogenic 494 
than BPA in a MCF -7 estrogen luciferase reporter assay, with a half maximal effective concentration 495 
(EC 50) of 1.8x10-6 M (Kitamura et al., 2005).  496 
Exposu re to BPA has been shown to be a contributing factor in neurodevelopmental disorders, raising 497 
the likelihood that BPA and its metabolites cross the blood -brain barrier. Ishido et al. (2011) examined 498 
the effects of BPA catechol and BPA 3,4 -quinone on hypera ctivity in rats, having previously 499 
demonstrated that neonatal BPA exposure elicits such behavior (Ishido et al., 2004; Ishido et al., 2007). 500 
Unlike BPA, BPA catechol and BPA 3,4 -quinone were found to have no significant effect on 501 
spontaneous motor activity . BPA was found in the brain tissues of rats treated with BPA three weeks 502 
subsequent to exposure (Ishido et al., 2011). BPA catechol and BPA 3,4 -quinone were not found in the 503 
brain tissues of rats treated with these chemicals, indicating a shorter residual  time or failure to cross 504 
the blood brain barrier.  505 
Evidence of estrogen and androgen antagonist activity among the hydroxylated and quinone BPA 506 
derivatives is limited. In an E2 assay system with MCF -7 cells, BPA catechol did not exhibit 507 
significant anti -estrogenic activity. In an NIH3T3 bioassay, BPA catechol showed weak anti - 508 
androgenic activity, several times lower than that of BPA (Kitamura et al., 2005).  509 
Several of the hydroxylated or quinone BPA derivatives have received little or no experimental 510 
scrut iny from the perspectives of endocrine activity or other biological effects. Kondrakov and 511 
colleagues (2014) speculated that BPA dicatechol, 4, 4'-(1-hydroxyethylidene) bis-1,2-benzenediol and 512 
4,4'-ethylidenebis -1,2-benzenediol are less estrogenic th an BPA. This analysis was based on Kitamura 513 45 
and colleagues' (2005) finding that hydroxyl substitution on the aromatic rings or propane bridge 514 
reduces estrogenicity. However, this hypothesis remains untested. Given that 4 -[1-(4-hydroxyphenyl) - 515 
1-methylethyl] -1,2,3 -benzenetriol (2,3 -OHBPA), BPA dicatechol, 4, 4'-(1-hydroxyethylidene) bis-1,2- 516 
benzenediol and 4, 4'-ethylidenebis -1,2-benzenediol have not been closely examined, and given the 517 
structural similarities to BPA catechol, which has been shown to und ergo metabolic transformation to 518 
mutagenic or genotoxic species, experimental data regarding these chemicals is needed.  519 
4. Bis(4 -hydroxyphenyl)methanone  520 
4.1. Sources of Bis(4 -hydroxyphenyl)methanone  521 
The benzophenone bis(4 -hydroxyphenyl)methanone (bis4 -HPM ) has been identified as a photoproduct 522 
of BPA (Molkenthin et al., 2013; Rodriguez et al., 2010). Benzophenones are widely used as UV filters 523 
in personal care products and industrial goods, and are prevalent in surface waters (Gago -Ferrero et al., 524 
2015) an d sewage effluent and sludge (Ruan et al., 2015). Bis4 -HPM has also been identified as a 525 
biological metabolite of bisphenol F in rat urine (Cabaton et al., 2009). As a result of its multiple 526 
sources and widespread environmental prevalence, it has received considerable scrutiny as an 527 
environmental pollutant and as an EDC that is potentially harmful to human health.  528 
4.2. Bio -effects of Bis(4 -hydroxyphenyl)methanone  529 
In an MCF -7 bioassay, 1 μM bis4 -HPM was shown to stimulate cancer cell proliferation at a leve l 530 
comparable to that brought about by E2 at 10 nM. In the same study, transcriptional activity was 531 
investigated using an Sp1 -Luciferase assay. In the activation of the Sp1 reporter gene, 1 μM bis4 -HPM 532 
was as potent as 0.010 μM E2 (Kerdival et al., 2013).  533 
In an examination of the biological activity of several bisphenols and their derivatives, bis4 -HPM was 534 46 
found to exhibit dose -dependent genotoxicity at 200 μM (Cabaton et al., 2009). Estrogenic effects 535 
similar to those of bisphenol F were observed, with EC 50 concentrations of 4.00 μM and 1.16 μM for 536 
ERα and ERβ, respectively. No anti -androgenic effects were observed. Estrogenicity of bis4 -HPM was 537 
also examined in separate work using a bioluminescence yeast estrogen screen assay, which found that 538 
it was weakly  estrogenic, with an EC 50 concentration approximately 20 times that of BPA, and 6 orders 539 
of magnitude higher than that of E2 (Ruan et al., 2015).  540 
Bis4-HPM has been found to bind to transport proteins, potentially interfering with natural intercellular 541 
horm one transport (Hong et al., 2015). It was shown to bind to human sex hormone -binding globulin, 542 
the major transport protein in serum that binds estrogens and androgens, and plays a role in regulating 543 
their availability to cells. Its IC 50 concentration was a pproximately 1/7 that of BPA. Woeste and 544 
colleagues (2013) found that it's SERCA inhibitory potency was similar to that of BPA, with the two 545 
chemicals exhibiting comparable IC 50 concentrations.  546 
In vivo  research examining the biological effects of bis4 -HPM  is limited. A recent study investigating 547 
the ecotoxicity of UV filters found that it was acutely toxic to vibrio fischeri bacteria , with an EC 50 548 
concentration of 9.9 mg/L (Molins -Delgado et al., 2016). Given the widespread prevalence of the 549 
chemical in aquatic systems, further examination of effects on aquatic species is warranted.  550 
5. Other Bisphenol A Derivatives  551 
2-[1-(4-hydroxyphenyl) -1-methylethyl] phenol ( o,p-bisphenol A) is an isomer of BPA with close 552 
structural similarity to BPA. It is a byproduct of BPA synthesis and a common impurity found in BPA 553 
(Godínez et al., 2011; Nowakowska et al., 1996; Terasaki et al., 2004). O,p-bisphenol A h as been the 554 
subject of several quantitative structure -activity relationship (QSAR) studies (Coleman et al., 2003; Cui 555 
et al., 2006; Klopman and Chakravarti, 2003) and at least two biological studies. Bioassay experiments, 556 47 
examining human estrogen receptor α (hERα) binding affinity, gene induction and MCF -7 human 557 
breast cancer cell proliferation (all relative to E2) found that o,p-bisphenol A is slightly less endocrine 558 
active than BPA by all three measures (Coleman et al., 2003). Terasaki and colleagues (200 5) found 559 
through yeast two -hybrid assay analysis that its binding affinites for hERα and medaka fish ERα were 560 
higher than that of BPA by factors of 3.0 and 1.4, respectively. The same study found that 2, 2'-(1- 561 
methylethylidene) bisphenol - another BPA is omer and BPA impurity (Terasaki et al., 2004) - exhibits 562 
relative binding affinites for hERα and medaka fish ERα slightly lower than those of BPA.  563 
4-Cumylphenol (4 -CP) is another close structural analog to BPA that has been detected as an impurity 564 
in indus trial grade BPA (Terasaki et al., 2004). In the marine environment, it has been found in lobster 565 
eggs, larvae and muscle tissue (Zuo et al., 2015; Laufer et al., 2013) and prawn muscle tissue (Zuo & 566 
Zhu, 2014). Terasaki and colleagues (2005) found that its  binding affinities toward hERα and medeka 567 
fish ERα exceed the activity of BPA by factors of 12 and 6.5, respectively.  568 
Sanseverino and colleagues (2009) examined 4 -CP's estrogenicity using bioluminescent yeast assays 569 
and found that its EC 20 (concentration  of 20% maximal effect) was 840 nM - nearly three orders of 570 
magnitude lower than that of BPA. In addition to estrogenic activity, another yeast -assay study 571 
demonstrated that 4 -CP's retinoic acid receptor binding affinity is several times higher than that o f BPA 572 
(Kamata et al., 2008). In addition to in vitro  evidence, i n vivo  studies have shown that short -term 573 
exposure of newborn rats to 4 -CP can cause lasting developmental abnormalities including reduced 574 
ovary growth (Hasegawa et al., 2007) and the occurren ce of renal cysts (Nakazawa et al., 2009).  575 
Coleman and colleagues (2003) found that the BPA photoproduct 4 -[1-(4-methoxyphenyl) -1- 576 
methylethyl]phenol  (BPA monomethyl ether) was less endocrine active than BPA as measured by 577 
hERα binding affinity, gene induct ion and MCF -7 human breast cancer cell proliferation. QSAR 578 48 
analysis indicated that the methoxy group contributed to a deactivating effect in regards to hERα 579 
binding affinity. In an in vitro assay, BPA monomethyl ether was shown to induce the formation of 580 
multipolar spindles in mitotic HeLa cells to a degree comparable to that of BPA (George et al., 2008). 581 
Multipolar spindles are a cell defect that leads to chromosomal instability in cell division, and are 582 
commonly found in tumor cell lines. This finding dem onstrated that both BPA monomethyl ether and 583 
BPA may be capable of disrupting cell division.   584 
4-hydroxy -β-(4-hydroxyphenyl) -β-methylbenzeneethanol has been identified as a degradation product 585 
of BPA via a Fenton reaction pathway (Poerschmann et al., 2010) . Effects of bisphenol analogues on 586 
induction of pS2 protein (a measure of estrogen -controlled gene expression) and progesterone receptor 587 
(PgR) were examined in a bioassay study using MCF -7 cancer cells (Rivas et al., 2002). 4 -hydroxy -β- 588 
(4-hydroxyphenyl) -β-methylbenzeneethanol was found to significantly increase PgR and pS2 levels. In 589 
the same study, using an MCF -7 cell proliferation assay, it was found to increase cell yield seven -fold 590 
at a concentration of 10 μM. Estrogenicity was confirmed using an MVLN (an MCF -7 derived cell 591 
line) luciferase induction assay, and a significant effect was seen at 10 μM. This is comparable to 592 
results observed in a separate study using an MCF -7 estrogen luciferase reporter assay (Kitamura et al., 593 
2005). In the latter study, 4-hydroxy -β-(4-hydroxyphenyl) -β-methylbenzeneethanol was also found to 594 
be inactive as an anti -androgen. In addition to empirical data, estimates of environmental risk using the 595 
OECD (Q)SAR Application Toolbox software predicted that it is a strong estrogen  binder, but is likely 596 
not significantly bioaccumulative, with a bioconcentration factor of 7.1 (Koleva and Georgieva, 2013).  597 
6. Structure and Endocrine Activity  598 
ER binding activity is highly dependent on chemical structure. ER binding depends on a favorab le 599 
interaction between an estrogen or xenoestrogen and a receptor's binding pocket, which is larger in 600 49 
volume than the typical bisphenol molecule, and is lined with nonpolar residues that interact favorably 601 
with nonpolar moieties. Binding requires a phenol ic ring attached to nonpolar regions aligned with the 602 
central portions of the binding pocket, meaning that hydrophobic substituents on the ring -linking 603 
carbon in bisphenols tend to increase estrogenicity (Coleman et al, 2003; Molina -Molina et al., 2013).   604 
Experimental data have shown that a 4 -hydroxyl substituent on one of the phenolic rings is most 605 
effective at facilitating binding, but hydroxyl groups in the 2 or 3 position have also been shown to be 606 
effective (Kitamura et al., 2005). Comparisons between  estrogen agonist activities of BPA and 4 -CP 607 
offer an inconclusive assessment of the effects of a 4 -hydroxyl group on the second phenolic ring. Paris 608 
and colleagues (2002) found that the second 4 -hydroxyl group greatly increased ERα and ERβ binding. 609 
Contra dictory data obtained by Terasaki and colleagues (2005) indicate that estrogenic activity is 610 
greater in the absence of the second 4 -hydroxyl group.  611 
The effect of halogenation on estrogenic activity is also uncertain. A comparative study of BPA, 612 
tetrabromo -BPA (TBBPA) and TCBPA showed that TCBPA has a significantly higher estrogen 613 
receptor binding affinity than BPA (Kitamura, et al., 2005). On the other hand, Riu et al., (2011) found 614 
that TCBPA had lower agonist activity than BPA toward ERα and estrogen rece ptor β (ERβ), while 615 
Rivas et al. (2001) found that TCBPA had lower estrogenic activity than BPA in an MCF -7 cell 616 
proliferation bioassay. While increased cytotoxicity in the halogenated species (Mutou et al., 2006b; 617 
Terasaki et al., 2011) may partially expl ain the inconsistencies in these results, nothing definitive can 618 
be said at this time regarding the effects of chlorination on estrogenicity. Less evidence is available 619 
regarding the effects of bromination. It has been shown that 3,5 bromination in TBBPA r educes 620 
binding affinity compared with that of BPA, and that binding affinity is lower than that of TCBPA. 621 
This may be due to steric hindrance from the larger bromine substituent (Kitamura et al., 2005).  622 50 
Evidence of thyroid agonist activity among bisphenol A derivatives is limited, and is mostly seen only 623 
in halogenated species, such as TCBPA, 3,3',5 -triClBPA and TBBPA. Species with halogen 624 
substituents in adjacent positions on either or both sides of a phenolic hydroxyl group tend to have 625 
greater thyroid ac tivity. These species are structurally analogous to T 3  and T 4, each of which have a 626 
phenolic hydroxyl group adjacent to 1 or 2 iodine substituents, respectively (Fig. 1). Steric factors may 627 
play a role in determining how the identity of the halogen affect s TH receptor binding. While some 628 
evidence shows that TBBPA is more thyroid active than TCBPA (Kitamura et al., 2005), other research 629 
has reached the opposite conclusion (Terasaki et al., 2011).  630 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  Thyroid hormones T 3 (3,3’,5 -triiodothyronine - top)   and T 4 (thyroxine)  
BPA has been shown to exhibit anti -androgenic activity (Kitamura et al., 2005; Paris, et al., 2002). 631 
Kitamura and colleagues' (2005) comparative study demonstrated that at least one 4 -hydroxyl group is 632 
necessary for androgen inhibition to occur. Additional  substituents in the adjacent 3 and 5 positions on 633 
phenolic rings reduce anti -androgenic activity (Sun et al., 2006; Kitamura et al., 2005). Evidence 634 
regarding anti -androgenic activity in this review is limited, and generally shows that most BPA 635 
51 
derivative s tend to be less anti -androgenic than BPA.  636 
7. Conclusions and future prospects  637 
Bisphenol A is a synthetic estrogenic chemical produced in large quantity to make polycarbonates, 638 
epoxy resins and thermal papers, which leads to its widespread presence in ind ustrial and consumer 639 
products and in the environment. Due to its endocrine disrupting properties, a great deal of scientific 640 
research has been performed to examine the occurrence, concentration levels, transport, bioeffects and 641 
fate of BPA in the environme nt. However, most of previous studies on risk assessment of BPA 642 
pollution on the human and environmental health were based on BPA itself, the contributions of BPA 643 
analogous derivative impurities and degradation intermediate products, which may possess simi lar or 644 
even more harmful bioeffects on wildlife and humans, were not included. This article has provided a 645 
review on the occurrence, estrogenic -related bioeffects and fate of BPA transformation products in 646 
which the bisphenol structure has been preserved, and BPA impurities and co -pollutants identified in 647 
previous studies. Special attention has been placed on BPA analogous derivatives. Some of the BPA 648 
cleavage and rearrangement products and their endocrine activity and other biological effects have 649 
been als o discussed. Seventy -nine such BPA degradation intermediates and analogous derivatives have 650 
been identified, five of them were found in effluents from paper recycling and water treatment plants as 651 
well as other chlorination processes, sixty -three were BPA transformation intermediate products in 652 
photo -degradation or other advanced oxidation processes, including ozonation, Fenton and photo - 653 
Fenton reactions, ultrasonic treatment, sensitized and/or catalyzed photochemical and thermal chemical 654 
processes, twenty -two were examined as impurities and co -pollutants in BPA products.  655 
Among the BPA analogues and bisphenol intermediates of BPA degradation that have received 656 
significant scrutiny, substantial evidence of endocrine disrupting activity and other adverse bioe ffects 657 52 
exists. It was found that chlorination of BPA usually increases its estrogenic disrupting activity and 658 
toxicity. The agonist assay using the yeast two -hybrid system showed that 3,3’ -diClBPA has an 659 
estrogenic activity 38 times greater than BPA. Chlor inated BPA have also been found to have a greater 660 
tendency to accumulate in human adipose tissue and a higher maternal transfer efficiency to newborns 661 
than BPA. Several halogenated BPA products have been found to exhibit metabolic, obesogenic effects 662 
and o ther biological activities not observed in BPA, such as thyroid hormonal activity. Hydroxylated, 663 
quinone and other oxidized BPA derivatives generated in photodegradation, sonochemical processes, 664 
ozonation and other advance oxidation, and biotransformation processes exhibit cytotoxic , genotoxic, 665 
mutagenic and carcinogenic properties although most of them are less estrogenic than BPA. Several 666 
BPA analogous impurities, such as 4 -cumylphenol, show much higher human estrogen receptor α 667 
(hERα) binding affinity an d other harmful bioeffects than BPA. However, many of the published works 668 
offer contradictory accounts regarding the nature of that activity, particularly around estrogen and 669 
thyroid activity of the chlorinated BPA derivatives. Continued investigation will  be necessary to 670 
resolve these inconsistencies and provide a more complete picture of the hazards associated with BPA.  671 
The review of the endocrine and other biological effects of the chemical transformation products, 672 
analogous derivatives and impurities of  BPA shows that the bioeffects of BPA itself represent an 673 
incomplete summation of the hazards to human and environmental health resulting from the 674 
widespread prevalence of BPA in the environment, in food and consumer products, and in drinking - 675 
water infrast ructure. A comprehensive risk assessment of BPA in the environment should consider also 676 
the endocrine disrupting and other biological activities of BPA and its polymer degradation 677 
intermediate products, impurities and co -pollutant analogous derivatives. Ou r current knowledge of 678 
these chemicals is incomplete. Further research work is urgently needed to (1) develop more sensitive 679 
and robust analytical and bioassay techniques for identification and characterization of BPA 680 53 
degradation intermediate products and analogous derivatives, of their occurrence, distribution and 681 
transport in the environment; (2) To investigate the mechanisms and kinetics of the degradation of 682 
bisphenol derivatives and their transformation intermediates, and examine the persistence and fa te of 683 
these analogous and transformation intermediate products in the environment, and determine their 684 
exposure risk to humans and ecosystems; (3) To better elucidate the mechanisms of endocrine 685 
disrupting and other hazardous biological activities from bis phenol transformation products and from 686 
coexposure to multiple bisphenol analogous and transformed derivatives along with other 687 
environmental pollutants. Most available toxicity tests are performed with a single bisphenol analog. In 688 
the environment, bisphe nol derivatives and their transformation products usually occur as a mixture. 689 
The potential additive or synergistic effects generated by a mixture of bisphenol derivatives, their 690 
degradation products and other toxicants should also be considered in human a nd environmental health 691 
risk assessment.  692
