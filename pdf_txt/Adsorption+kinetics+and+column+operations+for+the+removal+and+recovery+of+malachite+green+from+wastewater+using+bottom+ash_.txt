Adsorption of malachite green dye over the adsorbents (Ad) derived from Sapindus seed 
hull (S) and Camelina (C) after treatment with sulphuric acid is studied. Batch adsorption 
study on both Ad is compared as a function of various parameters such as pH, time, initial 
concentration and temperature. The isotherm data is found to be best presented by Langmuir 
model for both adsorbents. Separation factor (R L) revealed a favorable adsorption. Further, 
the rate of  adsorption followed pseudo -first order kinetics. The intraparticle diffusion model 
facilitates to understand mass transfer in adsorption of dye molecules. Thermodynamic 
analysis on both Ad revealed the spontaneity of the phenomena at higher temperature. T he 
comparative study illustrated higher adsorption capacity of CAd in comparison to SAd.  
Keywords: Adsorption, malachite green, Sapindus, and Camelina . 
 
 
Introduction  
The effluents discharged from industries mainly involved in the manufacturing of textiles, paper, 
plastic, leather, etc. contains different dyes which pollutes water resources. These dyes are highly  harm-
ful for the health of living species [1]. Among all Malachite green is one of such dye which cause seve r-
al health hazards to human. It  is very toxic and carcinogenic in nature [2–9]. For the removal of dyes 
from the waste liquid, researchers investigated various physical, chemical and biological methods [10–
12]. Among all those quoted methods, adsorption has been found to be the most att ractive method due to 
its simplicity. In this method, the effluent is separated from the liquid using adsorbent derived fr om va r-
ious sources. Commercially, the adsorbents are derived from natural sources like wood and coal which  
are very expensive [13, 14]. As a result, the separation of these effluents becomes cost intensive. Hence, 
the derivation of adsorbent shall be made cost effective. This can be achieved by either exploring a d-
sorption process or using cost effective feedstock. In last couple of years,  biowaste based feed stock m a-
terials  like agricultural byproducts olive stones, hen feathers, tuncbilek lignite, wheat bran, ric e bran, 
arundodonax root, pine saw dust, jute fibers, rice husk, bamboo, chitosan beads, marine alga, neem s aw-
dust, borassus fl ower, coconut fiber, baggas, soyabean and oil palm fiber have been tried [4,9,12,15 –24]. 
However, the potential of other bio -wastes like Sapindus seed hull and Camelina has not been studied. 
This work, therefore, presents a study for the production of low cost adsorbent from these two bio -waste 
feed-stocks and application in the removal of malachite green from the waste water. Further, the adsor p-
tion capacity of SAd and CAd is compared with other low cost adsorbents as quoted in the literature.  
 
Experimenta l 
Preparation: Sapindus seed hulls (S) and Camelina (C) were dried and crushed to powder of 
desired size. A fixed amount of both the raw materials were then mixed separately with concentrated 
sulphuric acid in 1:2 weight ratio. The adsorbents thus prepared  were then washed with distilled water 
and soaked in 1% NaHCO 3 solution overnight to neutralize the free acid. Again, both the adsorbents 
were washed with distilled water till pH reaches 6 −7 and dried in an air oven at 120 C for 4 h. The 
Sapindus and Camel ina based activated carbon adsorbents were named as SAd and CAd, respectively. 
The final particle size of both the adsorbents before adsorption studies was maintained to 150 µm by  
crushing.  
CHNS analysis  was done using CHNS analyser (vario MACRO cube); a sample weighing up to 
200 mg was heated to 1200 C. Helium gas draw on as a carrier gas.  Физическая х имия

2016, vol. 8, no. 2, pp. 51–60Adsorbate: Malachite green supplied by Thermofischer was used as such without any treatment. 
Distilled water was prepared by borosilicate distillation unit indigenously  and used for the preparation of 
solutions. Initially, a stock solution of 100 mg.L−1 was prepared and remaining working solutions were 
prepared by dilution.  
Adsorption studies: The adsorption isotherms and kinetics studies were carried out in batch wise 
fashion. Equilibrium study was conducted by taking 50 ml of different concentrations (10 −100 mg·L−1) 
of malachite green solution at pH 6 and 100 mg of AC was added. The mixture was then stirred for 360  
min at 120 rpm to ensure equilibrium. The solution conc entration was analyzed through uv -vis 
spectrophotometer (Varian Carry -100) at 617 nm. The amount of adsorption (q e) at equilibrium was 
calculated as:  
qୣ=(C୧−Cୣ)×V
m 
 
where m is the mass of dry adsorbent used (g), C i – initial and C e – equilibrium concentration (mg·L−1) 
of malachite green. The same expression was used for kinetics studies by replacing q e and C e with q t and 
Ct, respectively.  
Kinetic studies were carried out in the similar fashion with those of equilibrium experiments, 
wherein the sam ples were taken at different time intervals and analyzed as above. Four different 
concentrations of malachite green solutions (10, 40, 70 and 100 mg·g−1) were taken for the kinetic 
analysis at three different temperatures 30, 40, and 50 C. 
 
Results and Discussion  
Table 1 presents CHNSO content of all the four samples, where, ‘O’ content was calculated on the 
difference basis as: O, % = 100 –(C%+H%+N%+S%). H/C ratio depicts significant fall in both CAd and 
SAd in contrast to their respective precursors. It has been o bserved that although sample S is richer in 
carbon content than C; yet, CAd has shown greater extent of enrichment than SAd. The reason is the 
ease of volatiles excursion in the case of sample C; sapindus seeds are hard and the escalation of 
volatiles is n ot that much easier. This finding facilitates to understand the better adsorption ability of 
CAd in comparison to SAd.

The study of temperature effect on adsorption facilitates evaluation of thermodynamic parameters 
including enthalpy change, entropy change, Gibbs free energy likewise [25]. So, temperature dependent 
study was performed for malachite green dye adsorption at  30, 40 and 50 C. The extent of adsorption on 
CAdand SAdis presented in the Fig. 1 where each curve represent a study at particular temperature. B oth 
materials proved higher percent of dye removal with increase in temperature. The percent dye removal  
from solution at 30 C by SAd and CAd are found to be 6.5 and 19.5%, respectively, at initial 
concentration of 100 mg·L−1. These values, further, increased up to 19.5 and 30.8% for SAd and CAd, 
respectively, with increase in temperature to 50 C. This is clear fr om the experimental data that at 
higher temperature dye molecules must have been excited enough to reach adsorption site. Further, it  
is expected that a fall in viscosity of the solution at higher temperature improves boundary layer 
diffusion [10]. 
It is i mportant to study the effect of initial concentration on the adsorption rate. This study proves 
that at higher concentration the uptake of dye molecules increased for both CAd and SAd. The initial  
concentration provides driving force between aqueous soluti on and adsorbent [26]. At every temperature 
the same finding is observed. Although, the percent removal shows a drop in value due to the saturat ion 
of active sites in solid substrate; the uptake in mg.g–1 improves.  Сунанда Шарма, Пант  К.К.,              Исследование периодической адсорбции

Fig. 1. Different curves at temperatures  30, 40 and 50 C 
 
The pH of solution affects degree of ionization and hence, the extent of adsorption as explained 
[25]. In case of CAd, the adsorption uptake is found to increase from 12.7 to 20.6 mg·g−1 when pH of 
aqueous solution changes from 2 to 6 as shown in Fig. 2. Alike trend has been reported elsewhere [27]. 
It, further, dropped to 18.4 mg·g−1as pH is increased from 6 to 10. Similarly, q e for SAd increases from 
9.2 to 14.7 mg·g−1 with an increase in pH from 2 to 6. Again, q e lowered to 12.4 mg·g−1 as pH exceeds 6 
up to 10. Analogous behavior has been reported in the literature [10]. It proves that pH influence the 
surface charge of the adsorbents.

The effect of contact time on adsorption of malachite green is shown in Fig. 3 for CAd and SAd. It 
is clear from the figure that initially adsorption takes place at faster rate and after 150 min this  rate slows 
down. The reason behind so is the availabilit y of numerous sites for dye molecules to get adsorbed at an 
early stages of adsorption [10]. Later, decrease in diffusion rate as well as concentration gradient results 
in slow down of adsorption as mentioned [28]. Both adsorbents showed an equilibration s tate after 
180 min. Further, Fig. 3 depicts the possibility of monolayer adsorption of dye molecules due the 
smoothness and continuity of the curve [29].

2016, vol. 8, no. 2, pp. 51–60The adsorption isotherm tells the distribution of adsorbate in solid to liquid phase and hence, 
presents a relation among the quantity adsorbed q e to the concentration in the solution at equilibrium, C e. 
Among the various models in literature, the most commonly employed are Langm uir and Freundlich 
models. Langmuir model is used to understand the equilibrium with an important assumption of 
homogeneity of adsorption on the surface. The mathematical expression of Langmuir model is presented 
below [10]: 
Cୣ
qୣ=1
K୐q୫ୟ୶+1
q୫ୟ୶Cୣ 
where, q e is the amount of adsorbate adsorbed (mg·g−1) at equilibrium and evaluated as presented 
elsewhere, C e is the concentration at equilibrium (mg·L−1), q max represents monolayer capacity (mg·g−1) 
and K L in the above equation corresponds to adsorption equilibri um constant (L·mg−1). A graph between 
Ce/qe versus C e yields a straight line as shown in Fig. 4. The slope and intercept of this line produces q max 
and K L values and are presented in Table 2.  
    
Fig. 4. Langmuir isotherms for CAd and SAd at temperatures 30, 40 and 50 °C for initial concentration 40 mg·L−1 
 
It has been observed that q max for CAd and SAd increases from 14.41 to 23.04 and 4.83 to 
14.64  mg·g−1, respectively, when temperature was raised  from 30 to 50 C. This proves that higher 
temperature favors adsorption of malachite green on C and S derived adsorbents. Some lesser value of  
adsorption capacity has already been reported elsewhere [1, 7, 19, 29, 30]. Further, K L values at 30 C 
are found to be 0.92 and 0.59 L·mg−1 for CAd and SAd, respectively, and found to be raised to 1.85 and 
11.78  L·mg−1, respectively, at 50 C. Separation factor, R L indicates the nature of adsorption process and 
is evaluated using the relation as stated in [10]:  
R୐=ଵ
ଵା୏ైେ౥. 
Here, C o is the highest initial dye concentration. R L value between 0 and 1 signifies a favorable 
process of dye adsorption. During the adsorption of malachite green on CAd and SAd, this value varie s 
within the range 0.0107 −0.0009 and 0.0167−0.0008 , respectively, at all temperatures under study.

2016. Т. 8, № 2. С. 51–60 The following linear expression for Freundlich isotherm is used [10]: 
logqୣ=logK୤+1
n log Cୣ 
where, K f (mg·g−1·(mg·L−1)1/n) and n represents bonding energy [28] and process favorability, 
respectively. Freundlich constants, K fand n are evaluated from the plot between log q e and log C e as 
shown in Fig. 5 and are reported in Table 2 for CAd and SAd. It is found that temperature has positi vely 
affected and resulted i n the rise of both constants K f and n for CAd as well as SAd. The value of n 1 
indicates that the dye is favorably adsorbed favoring normal Langmuir isotherm on CAd and SAd. The 
correlation coefficient, R2 close to 1 depicts best fit of the equilibrium mod el. In this study, Langmuir 
model is best fitted to the equilibrium data for the malachite green dye adsorption on both adsorben ts 
CAd and SAd.

In order to understand the controlling step involved in the adsorption of malachite green such as 
diffusion, adsorption and chemical reaction; various kinetic models are employed to the experimental  
results. The pseudo -first-order expression is present ed below:  
ln(qୣ−q୲)=lnqୣ+kଵt 
where, q e and q t represents amount of dye adsorbed at equilibrium and at time, t; both in mg·g−1. The 
first order rate constant, k 1 (min−1) is evaluated from the slope of straight line between ln(q e– qt) and t as 
shown in Fig. 6.  The values of parameters k 1, qe and R2 at different initial concentrations are listed in 
Table 3. The values of R2 are found to be inconsistent and so, concluded that adsorption of malachite 
green dye does not follow pseudo -first-order kinetic model.

between t/q t and t as shown in Fig. 7 and are presented in  Table 3 at various initial concentrations. The 
correlation coefficient R2 for pseudo -second -order kinetic model is close to unity; this implies that 
adsorption phenomenon is best represented by second -order mechanism. Alike results for pseudo -second 
order  kinetics are presented elsewhere [10].

To study the mechanism of intraparticle diffusion Weber and Morris model is used:  
q୲=K୮t଴.ହ+c 
where, K p is the intraparticle diffusion constant (mg·g−1·min−0.5) and ‘c’ is a constant (mg·g−1). Graph 
between q t versus t0.5 produces a straight line as shown in Fig. 8. K p and ‘c’ are evaluated from slope and 
intercept, respectively, and are presented in Table 3. In the Weber and Morris model, ‘c’ represents  
boundary layer thickness [10,28]  and higher value indicates diffusion through this layer is the rate 
controlling step . The value of ‘c’ is found to increase from 0.05 to 0.14 mg·g−1 for SAd and from 0.06 to 
0.35 mg·g−1 in case of CAd with an increase in initial concentration from 10 to 100 mg·L−1. This change 
in value is attributed to the internal mass transfer that beco mes prominent at higher concentration and 468101214161820

2016. Т. 8, № 2. С. 51–60 external mass transfer decreases subsequently [28]. Further, the values of K p at higher concentration is 
observed to be more than that at lower concentration. It lies in the range 0.29 −0.82 and 0.09−0.14 
mg·g−1·min−0.5 for CAd and SAd, respectively, for an increase in initial concentration from 10 to 100 
mg·L−1. It is also concluded that CAd offers larger boundary layer effect in comparison to SAd as clear 
from Table 4; dye molecules have to overcome this extra resistance before they actually get adsorbed on 
the surface of an adsorbent.

Several thermodynamic parameters are determined from the basic relations as given below:  
lnK୐=∆S°
R−∆H°
RT 
where,  
∆G°=∆H°−T∆S°. 
In above relations, K L is the distribution coefficient, R is the universal gas constant and T is the 
temperature in K. The values for H and S are evaluated from slope and intercept, respectively, from 
the graph between ln K L vs. 1/T.

SAd 120.16  387.10  2.87 −1.00 −4.87 
 
All the thermodynamic parameters evaluated from the above equations are presented in Table 4. 
Temperature increment boosts negative free energy change of both solid substrates. The experimental 
value for G changes its trend from positive at 303 K to negative values at 313 and 323 K as clear from 
Table 4. It implies that the process was non -spontaneous at lower temperature andbecame spontaneous 
at higher temperature.Higher temperature enhances reaction rate;  hence, G shows a negative trend 
[31,32]. Again, H for CAd and SAd is found to be 100.26 and 120.16 kJ·mol−1, respectively. The 
positive values indicate that the process is endothermic in nature with SAd showing higher value. Th is 
finding is in agreeme nt with the above findings. For CAd and SAd, the value for S is observed to be 
330.22 and 387.10 J·mol−1·K−1, respectively. The positive values of S reflect an increase in 
randomness at solid -solution interface as well as affinity of adsorbents for the  dye molecules.  
 
Conclusions  
The potential of two adsorbents – CAd and SAd has been explored in this work. The following are 
the observations:  
 Camelina and Sapindus seeds based adsorbents showed maximum adsorption for pH 6 at 30 °C.   
 Increased initial concentration resulted in higher removal percentage of dye from water 
solution.  012345

Исследована адсорбция красителя малахитового зеленого над  адсорбентами (А d), 
полученными из скорлупы семян сапиндуса ( S) и растения Camelina  (C) после 
обработки серной кислотой. Изучено влияние на периодическую адсорбцию обоих 
адсорбентов различных параметров, таких как рН, время, начальная концентрация, 
темпера тура. Найдено, что изотермы для обоих адсорбентов лучше всего 
соответствуют модели Ленгмюра. Коэффициент разделения ( RL) свидетельствует об 
эффективной адсорбции. Скорость адсорбции кинетически отвечает псевдопервому 
порядку. Модель диффузии внутрь частиц облегчает понимание массопереноса при 
адсорбции молекул красителя. Термодинамический анализ на обоих Ad показал 
самопроизвольность процессов при повышенной температуре. Проведенное 
сравнительное исследование демонстрирует боль шую адсорбционную емкость СА d 
по сравнению с SАd. 
Ключевые слова: адсорбция, малахитовый зеленый, сапиндус, Camelina .
