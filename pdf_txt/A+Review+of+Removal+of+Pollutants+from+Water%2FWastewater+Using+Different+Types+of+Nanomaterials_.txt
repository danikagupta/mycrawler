1. Introduction
Waterhasabroadimpactonallaspectsofhumanlifeinclud-
ing but not limited to health, food, energy, and economy. Inadditiontotheenvironmental,economic,andsocialimpactsofpoorwatersupplyandsanitation[ 1–4],thesupplyoffresh
waterisessentialforthesafetyofchildrenandthepoor[ 5,6].
It is estimated that 10–20 million people die every year dueto waterborne and nonfatal infection causes death of morethan 200 million people every year [ 7]. Every day, about
5,000–6,000 children die due to the water-related problemof diarrhea [ 8,9]. There are currently more than 0.78 billion
people around the world who do not have access to safewaterresources[ 10] resultingin majorhealthproblems. It is
estimatedthatmorethanonebillionpeopleintheworldlackaccesstosafewaterandwithincoupleofdecadesthecurrentwatersupplywilldecreasebyone-third.
The portion of total run-off which constitutes stable
run-off flow is considered as the freshwater resource uponwhichhumansdepend.Thisstablefreshwaterflowhasbeen
estimated at 12,500–15,000km
3peryear[ 11,12], from which
4000km3peryearisconsideredtobethetotalfreshwaterfor

of the world’s 1.4 billionKm3of water which is furthermore

There is limited possibility of an increase in the supply
offreshwaterduetocompetingdemandsofincreasingpop-
ulations throughout the world; also, water-related problems
are expected to increase further due to climate changes and
due to population growth over the next two decades [ 18].
It is estimated that worldwide population will increase byabout 2.9 billion people between now and 2050 (accordingto UN’s average projections) [ 15]. Shortage of fresh water
supply is also a result of the exploitation of water resourcesfor domestic, industry, and irrigation purposes in many

partsoftheworld[ 19].Thepressureonfreshwaterresources
due to the increasing world’s demand of food, energy, andso forth [ 20,21] is increasing more and more due to
population growth and threats of climate change. Pollutingsurface/ground water sources is another cause of reducedfresh water supplies [ 22–24]. Aquifers around the world
are depleting and being polluted due to multiple problems
of saltwater intrusion, soil erosion, inadequate sanitation,contamination of ground/surface waters by algal blooms,detergents, fertilizers, pesticides, chemicals, heavy metals,andsoforth[ 25–28].
The occurrence of new/emerging microcontaminants
(e.g., endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs)) in pol-luted water/wastewater has rendered existing conventionalwater/wastewater treatment plants ineffective to meet theenvironmentalstandards.Thedischargeofthesecompoundsinto the aquatic environment has affected all living organ-isms. The traditional materials and treatment technologieslike activated carbon, oxidation, activated sludge, nanofil-tration (NF), and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes are noteffective to treat complex and complicated polluted waterscomprisingpharmaceuticals,personalcareproducts,surfac-tants, various industrial additives, and numerous chemicalspurported. The conventional water treatment processes arenotabletoaddressadequatelytheremovalofawidespectrumof toxic chemicals and pathogenic microorganisms in rawwater.
This is the right time to address water problems since
aquifers around the world are depleting due to multiplefactors such as saltwater intrusion and contamination from
surface waters. Using better purification technologies can
reduce problems of water shortages, health, energy, andclimate change. A considerable saving of potable water canbe achieved through reuse of wastewater which, in turn,requires the development materials and methods which areefficient, cost-effective, and reliable. Although dilution ofcomplex wastewater effluents can help decreasing the loadof micropollutants downstream [ 29,30], however, much
of them pass through conventional water treatment dueto occurrence of these substances in micro- or even innanogramsperliter.
Biological treatment systems such as activated sludge
and biological trickling filters are unable to remove a widerange of emerging contaminants and most of these com-poundsremainsolubleintheeffluent[ 31–33].Physicochem-
ical treatments such as coagulation, flocculation, or limesoftening proved to be ineffective for removing differentEDCs and pharmaceutical compounds in various studies[34–36].Chlorination,thoughprovidingresidualprotection
againstregrowthofbacteriaandpathogens[ 37,38],resultsin
undesirable tastes and odors [ 39] in addition to the forming
of different disinfection by-products (DBPs) in portabledrinkingwater[ 40–43].Ozonationhasbeenconsideredtobe
a less attractive alternative due to expensive costs and short
lifetime. Both ultraviolet (UV) photolysis and ion exchange,
though being advanced type of treatments, are not feasiblealternativesformicropollutantsremoval[ 44].
Membrane processes like microfiltration, ultrafiltration,
N F ,a n dR O ,w h i c ha r ep r e s s u r e - d r i v e nfi l t r a t i o np r o c e s s e s ,are considered as some new highly effective processes
[44–49]. These are considered as alternative methods of
removing huge amounts of organic micropollutants [ 50–
52]. Water/wastewater treatment by membrane techniques
is cost-effective and technically feasible and can be betteralternatives for the traditional treatment systems since their
high efficiency in removal of pollutants meets the high
environmentalstandards[ 53].NFandROhaveprovedtobe

higher energy consumption in RO makes it less attractivethan NF where removal of pollutants is caused by differentmechanisms including convection, diffusion (sieving), andchargeeffects[ 56].AlthoughNFbasedmembraneprocesses
arequiteeffectiveinremovinghugeloadsofmicropollutants[57],advancedmaterialsandtreatmentmethodsarerequired

Since the water industry is required to produce drinking
water of high quality, there is a clear need for the devel-opment of cost-effective and stable materials and methodsto address the challenges of providing the fresh water inadequate amounts. There are inventions of new treatmentmethods; however, they need to be stable, economical, andmore effective as compared with the already existing tech-niques. For this, traditional treatment technologies have tobe modernized, that is, updated or modified or replacedby developing materials and methods which are efficient,cost-effective, and reliable. This is particularly important toachieveaconsiderablepotablewatersavingsthroughreuseofwastewaterinadditiontotacklingtheday-by-dayworsening

terials (e.g., carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and dendrimers) arecontributing to the development of more efficient treatmentprocesses among the advanced water systems [ 59]. There

2. Nanotechnology for
Water/Wastewater Purification
There are rising demands of clean water throughout the
world as freshwater sources/resources are depleting due toAdvancesinMaterialsScienceandEngineering 3
prolonged droughts, increasing population, climate changes
threats, and strict water quality standards [ 60,61].Massesin
developingcountriesareusingunconventionalwatersources(e.g., stormwater, contaminated fresh water, brackish water)duetolimitedanddepletingfreshwatersupplies.Theexistingwatertreatmentsystems,distributionsystems,anddisposable
habits coupled with huge centralized schemes are no more
sustainable.Thecurrentresearchesdonotadequatelyaddressthe practices that guarantee the availability of water for allusersinaccordancewiththestringentwaterqualitystandards[62].
Several commercial and noncommercial technological
developments are employed on daily basis but nanotech-nology has proved to be one of the advanced ways forwater/waste water treatment. Developments in nanoscaleresearchhavemadeitpossibletoinventeconomicallyfeasibleandenvironmentallystabletreatmenttechnologiesforeffec-tively treating water/wastewater meeting the ever increasingwater quality standards. Advances in nanotechnology haveprovidedtheopportunitiestomeetthefreshwaterdemandsofthefuturegenerations.Itissuggestedthatnanotechnologycan adequately address many of the water quality issues byusingdifferenttypesofnanoparticlesand/ornanofibers[ 63].
Nanotechnology uses materials of sizes smaller than 100nmin at least one dimension (Figure 1)m e a n i n ga tt h el e v e lo f
atomsandmoleculesascomparedwithotherdisciplinessuchaschemistry,engineering,andmaterialsscience[ 64,65].
At this scale, materials possess novel and significantly
changedphysical,chemical,andbiologicalpropertiesmainlydue to their structure, higher surface area-to-volume ratio
offering treatment and remediation, sensing and detection,
and pollution prevention [ 66,67]. These unique properties
of nanomaterials, for example, high reactivity and strongsorption, are explored for application in water/wastewatertreatment based on their functions in unit operations ashighlightedinTable 1[68].
Nanoparticles can penetrate deeper and thus can treat
water/wastewater which is generally not possible by con-ventional technologies [ 69]. The higher surface area-to-
volume ratio of nanomaterials enhances the reactivity withenvironmentalcontaminants.
In the context of treatment and remediation, nanotech-
nology has the potential to provide both water quality andquantity in the long run through the use of, for example,membranes enabling water reuse, desalination. In addition,it yields low-cost and real-time measurements through thedevelopment of continuous monitoring devices [ 70,71].
Nanoparticles,havinghighabsorption,interaction,andreac-tioncapabilities,canbehaveascolloidbymixingmixedwithaqueoussuspensionsandtheycanalsodisplayquantumsizeeffects[72–76].Energyconservationleadingtocostsavingsis
possible due to their small sizes; however, overall usage costofthetechnologyshouldbecomparedwithothertechniquesin the market [ 77]. Figure 2depicts some of the different

treatment[ 78–80].
Nanomaterials have effectively contributed to the devel-
opment of more efficient and cost-effective water filtrationprocessessincemembranetechnologyisconsideredasoneofthe advanced water/wastewater treatment processes [ 81–91].
N a n o pa rtic lesh a v ebeenfr eq uen tl yu sedinth em a n ufact ur -ingofmembranes,allowingpermeabilitycontrolandfouling-resistance in various structures and relevant functionalities[92,93]. Both polymeric and inorganic membranes are

nanomaterials used in this formation include, for example,metal oxide nanoparticles like TiO
2. CNTs have resulted in
desired outputs of improved permeability, inactivation ofbacteria,andsoforth[ 97,98].
Finally, nanofibrous media have also been used to
improvethefiltrationsystemsduetotheirhighpermeabilityand small pore size properties [ 99]. They are synthesized by
a new and efficient fabrication process, namely, electrospin-ning and may exhibit different properties depending on theselected polymers [ 100]. In short, the development of dif-
ferent nanomaterials like nanosorbents, nanocatalysts, zeo-lites, dendrimers, and nanostructured catalytic membranesh a sm a d ei tp o s s i b l et od i s i n f e c td i s e a s ec a u s i n gm i c r o b e s ,removing toxic metals, and organic and inorganic solutesfrom water/wastewater. An attempt is made to highlightthe factors that may influence the efficiency of the removalprocesses based on the available literature in the followingsection.
3. Pollutants Removal Using
Different Nanomaterials
3.1. Disinfection. Biological contaminants can be classi-
fied into three categories, namely, microorganisms, naturalorganicmatter(NOM),andbiologicaltoxins.Microbialcon-taminantsincludehumanpathogensandfreelivingmicrobes[101–105]. The removal of cyanobacterial toxins is an issue
in conventional water treatment systems [ 106,107]. Many
adsorbentsincludingactivatedcarbonhavereasonablygoodremoval efficiencies and again a number of factors influencetheremovalprocess[ 108–111].
Contaminationfrombacteria,protozoans,andvirusesis
possible in both ground and surface water. The toxicity ofthe standard chlorine chemical disinfection in addition tothe carcinogenic and very harmful by-products formationis already mentioned. Chlorine dioxide is expensive andresultsintheproductionofhazardoussubstanceslikechloriteand chlorate in manufacturing process. Ozone, on the other
hand,hasnoresidualeffectsbutproducesunknownorganic
reactionproducts.ForUVdisinfection,longerexposuretimeis required for effectiveness and also there is no residualeffect.Despiteadvancesindisinfectiontechnology,outbreaksfrom waterborne infections are still occurring. So, advanceddisinfectiontechnologiesmust,atleast,eliminatetheemerg-ing pathogens, in addition to their suitability for large-scaleadoption. There are many different types of nanomaterialssuch as Ag, titanium,and zinc capable of disinfectingwater-bornedisease-causingmicrobes.Duetotheirchargecapacity,they possess antibacterial properties.

The efficacy of metal ions in water disinfection has been
highlightedbymanyresearchers[ 112].Thispartofthepaper
covers the application of these antimicrobial nanomaterialsforwaterdisinfection.
3.1.1. Silver Nanoparticles. Silver is the most widely used
material due to its low toxicity and microbial inactivationinwater [113–116] with well-reported antibacterial mechanism
[117,118]. Silver nanoparticles are derived from its salts like
silver nitrate and silver chloride, and their effectiveness asbiocides is documented in the literature [ 119–123]. Though
the antibacterial effect is size dependent [ 124], smaller Ag
nanoparticles(8nm)weremosteffective,whilelargerparticle
size (11–23nm) results in lower bactericidal activity [ 125].
Also, truncated triangular silver nanoplates exhibited bet-ter antibacterial effects than the spherical and rod-shapednanoparticles indicating their shape dependency [ 126]. The
mechanisms involved during the bactericidal effects of Agnanoparticles include, for example, the formation of freeradicalsdamagingthebacterialmembranes[ 127,128],inter-
actions with DNA, adhesion to cell surface altering themembraneproperties,andenzymedamage[ 122,129,130].
Immobilized nanoparticles have gained importance due
to high antimicrobial activity [ 131]. Embedded Ag nanopar-
ticles have been reported as very effective against bothGram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [ 63]. In a study,the cellulose acetate fibers embedded with Ag nanoparti-
cles by direct electrospinning method [ 132]w e r es h o w n
effective against both types of bacteria. Ag nanoparticlesare also incorporated into different types of polymers forthe production of antimicrobial nanofibers and nanocom-posites[133–135].Poly(𝜀-caprolactone-)basedpolyurethane
nanofiber mats containing Ag nanoparticles were preparedas antimicrobial nanofilters in a study [ 136]. Different
types of nanofibers containing Ag nanoparticles are pre-pared for antimicrobial application and exhibited very goodantimicrobial properties [ 137–139]. Water filters prepared by
polyurethane’s foam coated with Ag nanofibers have showngoodantibacterialpropertiesagainst Escherichiacoli (E.coli)
[112].
Thereareotherexamplesoflow-costpotablemicrofilters

nanoparticles also find their applications in water filtrationmembranes,forexample,inpolysulfonemembranes[ 141],for
biofoulingreductionandhaveprovedeffectiveagainstvarietyof bacteria and viruses [ 142–148]. These Ag nanoparticles
laden membranes had good antimicrobial activities againstE.coli,Pseudomonas ,andsoforth[ 149,150].
Finally, Ag nanocatalyst alone and incorporate with

inactivating bacteria and viruses as well as reducing mem-branebiofouling,theirlong-termefficacyagainstmembranebiofouling has not been reported mainly due to loss of silverionswithtime[ 152,153].So,furtherworktoreducethisloss
of silver ions is required for long-term control of membranebiofouling. Alternatively, doping of Ag nanoparticles withother metallic nanoparticles or its composites with metal-oxide nanoparticles can solve the issue and this could also
leadtotheparallelremovalofinorganic/organiccompounds
fromwater/wastewater.
3.1.2.TiO
2Nanoparticles. TiO2nanoparticlesareamongthe
emergingandmostpromisingphotocatalystsforwaterpurifi-cation [154,155]. The basic mechanism of a semiconductor-
b a s e dp h o t o c a t a l y s t sl i k el o w - c o s tT i O
2having good pho-
toactivity and nontoxicity [ 156] involves the production of
highly reactive oxidants, such as OH radicals, for disin-fection of microorganisms, bacteria, fungi, algae, viruses,and so forth [ 157–165]. TiO
2,a ft e r8h o u r so fs i m u l a t e d
solar exposure, has been reported to reduce the viability ofseveralwaterbornepathogenssuchasprotozoa,fungi, E.coli,andPseudomonas aeruginosa [166]. A complete inactivation
of fecal coliforms under sunlight is reported in a studyexpressing the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency of TiO
2
[167].
ThelimitedphotocatalyticcapabilityofTiO2,thatis,only
under UV light, has improved drastically by extending itsoptical absorbance to the visible-light region [ 168,169]. This
was achieved by doping transition metals [ 170]a n da n i o n i c
nonmetals such as nitrogen [ 171–180], carbon [ 181–187], sul-
fur[188–190],orfluorine[ 191]intoTiO

As highlighted, the synthesis of visible-light-activated
TiO
2nanoparticles has attracted considerable interest [ 198],
andTiO2nanoparticlesandnanocrystallinesirradiatedwith
UV-visiblelightexhibitedstrongbactericidalactivityagainst
E. coli[199–202]. Metal-doped TiO2nanoparticles, sulfur,

nanoparticles of transition metal oxides and nanostructured6 AdvancesinMaterialsScienceandEngineering
TiO2photocatalysts showed great potential for water dis-
infection. For example, metal-ion-modified nitrogen-dopedTiO

have shown enhanced disinfection efficiency against E. coli

Bacillussubtilis sporesduetophotocatalyticoxidationunder

Nitrogen-dopedTiO2nanoparticlescatalystshaveproved
their efficiency for degradation of microbial contaminantsin water [ 151]. Nanostructured TiO
2films and membranes
arecapableofdisinfectingmicroorganismsinadditiontothedecomposition of organic pollutants under UV and visible-
light irradiation [ 207]. Due to its stability in water, TiO
2
can be incorporated in thin films or membrane filters for
water filtration [ 208,209]. TiO2nanorods and nanofilms
exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity than commercialTiO
2nanoparticles and TiO2thin films, respectively, for
the photocatalytic inactivation of E. coli[191,210,211]. The
inactivationmechanismof E.coliwhenusingTiO2thinfilms
was also investigated by many researchers [ 212,213]. In a
study,TiO2nanocompositeswith multiwalledCNTs showed
the complete inactivation of bacterial endospores ( Bacillus
cereus), compared to commercial TiO2nanoparticles [ 214].
ImmobilizedTiO2nanoparticlefilmssuccessfullyinactivated

The detailed review has demonstrated the antibacterial
efficiency of TiO
2nanoparticles, but the actual underlying
mechanisms are not well defined especially under visiblelight. In addition, composites of TiO
2nanoparticles by dop-
ing with other metallic nanoparticles have also shown theireffectiveness, but the applications of using TiO
2nanofibers
andthinfilmsneedtobeinvestigatedfortheeffectiveremovalof both inorganic/organic compounds in addition to thedisinfection.
3.1.3.CNTsandOthers. CNTshaveprovedtobeveryeffective
in removing bacterial pathogens. CNTs (one of nanosor-b e n t s )w h i c hh a v eb e e nu s e df o rr e m o v a lo fb i o l o g i c a limpurities have received special attention for their excellentcapabilitiesofremovingbiologicalcontaminantsfromwater[63]. CNTs possess antimicrobial characteristics against a
wide range of microorganisms including bacteria such as E.
coliandSalmonella [217–222]a n dv i r u s e s[ 223,224]. The
adsorption of cyanobacterial toxins on CNTs is also higherwhencomparedwithcarbon-basedadsorbentsmainlyduetolarge specific surface area, external diameter of CNTs, largecompositionofmesoporousvolume,andsoforth[ 225–228].
Researchers have attributed the antimicrobial effects of
CNTs to their unique physical, cytotoxic, and surface func-tionalizing properties [ 229], their fibrous shape [ 230,231],
the size and length of the tubes, and number of layers(single-ormultiwalled)[ 155,232].Themechanismsofkilling
bacteriabyCNTsarealsoduetotheproductionofoxidativestress, disturbances to cell membrane, and so forth [ 233].
Although single-walled CNTs are more detrimental againstmicroorganismsthanmultiwalledCNTs[ 234],dispersivityof
CNTsisamoreimportantparameterthanlength[ 235].Many
researchers observed an extremely high adsorption rate ofbacteria by single-walled CNTs, in addition to their highsorptioncapacitiesbymanyresearchers[ 236–244].
Filtration membranes containing radially aligned CNTs
are very effective in removing both bacteria and viruses in
very short time due to size exclusion and depth filtration[245–247] and thus enable such filters to be used as cost-
effective and point-of-use water disinfection devices. CNTs
can also reduce membrane biofouling and a nanocomposite
membraneofsingle-walledCNTsandpolyvinyl-N-carbazole

in thin film nanocomposite membranes is the single-walledCNTs covalently bonded to thin film composite membranesurfacewhichhaveexhibitedmoderateantibacterialproper-ties[249].

midis,andBacillussubtilis thuscoveringbothGram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria as well as spores [ 250,251].
Magnesium oxide nanoparticles were also used effectivelyas biocides against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacteria and bacterial spores [ 252,253].Nanotungsten oxide
andpalladium-incorporatedZnOnanoparticleshaveshowngood antibacterial properties at removal of E. colifrom
water[254,255].Nitrogen-dopedZnOandZirconiumoxide
nanoparticlesalsohaveprovedgoodantibacterialnanostruc-
turedmaterials[ 151,256].
3.2. Desalination. Desalination is considered an important
alternative for obtaining fresh water source. Though expen-sive, membrane based desalination processes cover most ofthe desalination capability out of which only RO accountsfor 41% [257].Parameters that control the desalination cost
include maximizing the flux of water through membrane tominimize the fouling. Recent developments in membranetechnology have resulted in energy efficiency in RO plants[258]. NF has also been evaluated for desalinating seawater
[259].
Nanomaterials are very useful in developing more effi-
cient and cheaper nanostructured and reactive membranes
for water/wastewater treatment and desalination such asCNTfilters[ 260].Nanomaterialsofferopportunitiestocon-
trolthecostofdesalinationandincreaseitsenergyefficiencya n da m o n gt h e s ea r eC N T s[ 261,262], zeolites [ 263,264],

ThinfilmnanocompositemembranescontainingAgand

Membrane permeability and salt rejection are shown to beeffected by the number of coatings in TiO

based membranes for RO have exhibited high flux withexcellentionrejectioncharacteristics[ 275,276].Studiesalso
have indicated the potential of graphene membranes for
water desalination with higher fluxes than polymeric RO
membranes[ 277].

3.3. Removal of Heavy Metals and Ions. Different types of
nanomaterials have been introduced for removal of heavymetals from water/wastewater such as nanosorbents includ-ingCNTs,zeolites,anddendrimersandtheyhaveexceptionaladsorption properties [ 63]. The ability of CNTs to adsorb
heavy metals is reviewed by many researchers [ 287]s u c ha s
Cd
2+[288],Cr3+[289],Pb2+[290],andZn2+[291]andmet-
alloids such as arsenic (As) compounds [ 292]. Composites
of CNTs with Fe and cerium oxide (CeO2)h a v ea l s ob e e n
reportedtoremoveheavymetalionsinfewstudies[ 293–295].
Cerium oxide nanoparticles supported on CNTs are usedeffectivelytoadsorbarsenic[ 289].Fastadsorptionkineticsof
CNTs is mainly due to the highly accessible adsorption sitesandtheshortintraparticlediffusiondistance[ 287].
Metalbasednanomaterialsprovedtobebetterinremov-
ing heavy metals than activated carbon [ 296], for example,
adsorptionofarsenicbyusingTiO
2nanoparticlesandnano-
sized magnetite [ 297,298]. The utilization of photocatalysts
such as TiO2nanoparticles has been investigated in detail
to reduce toxic metal ions in water [ 299]. In a study, the
effectiveness of nanocrystalline TiO2in removing different
f o r m so fa r s e n i ci se l a b o r a t e da n di th a ss h o w nt ob em o r eeffective photocatalyst than commercially available TiO

nanoparticleswithamaximumremovalefficiencyofarsenicat about neutral pH value [ 300]. A nanocomposite of TiO
2
nanoparticles anchored on graphene sheet was also used
to reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III) in sunlight [ 301]. Similar Crtreatment was carried out by using palladium nanoparticles
inanotherstudy[ 302].
The capability of removing heavy metals like As is also
investigated by using iron oxide nanomaterials (Fe2O3and
Fe3O4) as cost-effective adsorbents by many researchers
[303–305]. Arsenic removal was also investigated by using
high specific surface area of Fe3O4nanocrystals [ 306].
Polymer-grafted Fe2O3nanocomposite was effectively used
to remove divalent heavy metal ions for copper, nickel, and
cobaltoverapHrangeof3to7[ 307].
Bisphosphonate-modified magnetite nanoparticles were
also used to remove the radioactive metal toxins, uranium
dioxide(UO22+)withhighefficiencyfromwater[ 308].Stud-
ies have shown that zero-valent iron or iron nanoparticles
(nZVI or Fe0) are very effective for the transformation of
heavymetalionssuchasAs(III),As(V),Pb(II),Cu(II),Ni(II),andCr(VI)[ 309–313].ReductionofCr(VI)toCr(III)wasalso
done by using nZVI and bimetallic nZVI nanoparticles in a
study[314].
Novel self-assembled 3D flower-like iron oxide nanos-
tructures were also used to successfully adsorb both As(V)
and Cr(VI) [ 315]. The 3D nanostructures of CeO
2are
used as good adsorbents for both As and Cr [ 316]. The
efficiency of NaP1 zeolites was evaluated for removal of
heavy metals (Cr(III), Ni(II), Zn(II), Cu(II), and Cd(II))from wastewater [ 317,318]. Dendritic polymers were also
usedfortreatmentoftoxicmetalions[ 319].Theapplicability
of self-assembled monolayers on mesoporous supports forremovingtoxicmetalionsnovelwasalsoevaluatedby manyresearchers[ 320–322].Biopolymershavebeenusedforheavy

A dendrimer-UF system was used for the removal of Cu
2+
and the complete removal from water was obtained [ 330].
Finally, there are commercial products for efficient removalof arsenic and these include iron oxide nanoparticles andpolymers and nanocrystalline titanium dioxide medium intheformofbeads[ 331,332].
3.4. Removal of Organic Contaminants. NOM constitutes a
diverse group of hydrophobic (humic and fulvic acids) andhydrophilic organic compounds and it contributes signifi-cantly towards water contamination [ 333–339]. A variety of
carbon-based adsorbents have been used for the removal ofNOMfromrawwaterandseveralfactorsaffectthissorptionofNOM[ 340–343].8 AdvancesinMaterialsScienceandEngineering
3.4.1. CNTs. Different types of nanomaterial like nanosor-
bents such as CNTs, polymeric materials (e.g., dendrimers),and zeolites have exceptional adsorption properties and areapplied for removal of organics from water/wastewater [ 63].
CNTshavereceivedspecialattentionduetotheirexceptionalwater treatment capabilities and adsorption of organics on
CNTs is widely studied and extensively reviewed [ 287]. The
removal of NOM by CNTs is higher when compared withcarbon-based adsorbents mainly due to large surface areasand other factors [ 344,345]. CNTs are also effective to
remove polycyclic aromatic organic compounds [ 346–348]
andatrazine[ 345].
Nanoporous activated carbon fibers, prepared by elec-
trospinning of CNTs, showed much higher organic sorptionequilibriumconstantsforbenzene,toluene,xylene,andethyl-b e n z e n et h a ng r a n u l a ra c t i v a t e dc a r b o n[ 349]. The sorption
of 1,2-dichlorobenzene by CNTs has been shown as effectivein one study [ 350]. Compared with activated carbon, both
single- and multiwalled CNTs displayed higher adsorptioncapacities for trihalomethanes [ 293,351]. Multiwalled CNTs
have been used as sorbents for chlorophenols, herbicides,DDTs, and so forth [ 352–355]. Finally, novel polymers with
functionalized CNTs showed effective removal of organicpollutantsfromwater[ 295].
3.4.2.TiO
2Nanoparticles. Metaloxidenanomaterialssuchas
TiO2in addition to CeO2have also been used as catalysts
for fast and comparatively complete degradation of organicpollutants in ozonation processes [ 356,357]. Photocatalysts
likeTiO
2nanoparticlesareusedeffectivelyforthetreatment
ofwatercontaminatedwithorganicpollutantslikepolychlo-rinatedbiphenyls(PCBs),benzenes,andchlorinatedalkanes[299].Removaloftotalorganiccarbonfromwastewater was
enhanced by the addition of TiO

MultiwalledCNTsfunctionalizedwithFenanoparticleshavebeen proved effective sorbents for aromatic compounds likebenzeneandtoluene[ 359].
Decomposition of organic compounds can be enhanced
by noble metal doping into TiO
2due to enhanced hydroxyl
radical production and so forth [ 360–362]. For example,
the doping Si into TiO2nanoparticles was effective to
improve its efficiency due to the increase in surface areaand crystallinity [ 363,364]. TiO
2nanocrystals modified
with noble metal deposits and so forth were used for the
degradationofmethyleneblueinthevisible-lightrange[ 198,
365,366]. Nitrogen- and Fe(III-) doped TiO2nanoparticles
were better in degrading azo dyes and phenol, respectively,than commercially available TiO
2nanoparticles [ 367,368].
TiO2nanoparticles deposited onto porous Al2O3were used
effectively for the removal of TOC in a study [ 369]. TiO2
nanocomposites with mesoporous silica were also used for
thetreatmentofaromaticpollutants[ 370–373].Acomposite
of nanosized SO42−/TiO2was used for the degradation of 4-
nitrophenol in one study [ 374]. TiO2nanotubes have been

3.4.3. Zero-Valent Iron. Nanocatalysts including semicon-
ductor materials, zero-valence metal, and bimetallic nano-
particles have been used for degradation of environmentalcontaminants such as PCBs, pesticides, and azo dyes dueto their higher surface area and shape dependent properties[380]. Magnetic nanosorbents also have proved effective in
organic contaminants removal [ 381]. Iron oxide nanomate-
rialshaveshownbetterremovalcapabilitiesoforganicpollu-tantsthanbulkmaterials[ 303,382,383].Fe

PCBs have been transformed successfully using nZVI [ 385–
387]aswellasinorganicionssuchasnitrateandperchlorate
[388,389].
Particles of nZVI have been proved effective in degrada-
tion of toxic chlorinated organic compounds, for example,2,2
󸀠-dichlorobiphenylinafewremediationstudies[ 390,391].
The stabilized nZVI particles could also be an effectiveway for in situ remediation of groundwater or industrialeffluents[ 392].ThenZVIandbimetallicnZVIhaveemerged
as effective redox media for reducing a variety of organicpollutantssuchasPCBs,pesticides,organicdyes,chlorinatedalkanes, and alkenes and inorganic anions (e.g., nitrates)in water/wastewater due to larger surface areas and reac-
tivity [393,394]. Bimetallic Ni
0/Fe0and Pd0/Fe0nanopar-
ticles were more effective than commercial microscale Fefor reductive dehalogenation of chlorinated organics andbrominated methanes, hydrodechlorination of chlorinatedaliphatics, chlorinated aromatics, and PCBs as reported bymanyresearchers[ 395–402].
3.4.4.OtherNanomaterials. Inastudy,nanostructuredZnO
semiconductor films were used for degradation of organiccontaminants (4-chlorocatechol) [ 403]. The nanocatalyst of
Agandamidoximefiberswasusedefficientlyfordegradationof organic dyes [ 404]. A bimetallic nanocomposite of Pd-
Cu/𝛾-alumina was used for the reduction of nitrate in one
study [405]. Traces of halogenated organic compounds were
biodegradedusinghydrogenandthePdbasednanoparticles[301,406]. Pd nanoparticles and bimetallic Pd/Au (gold)
nanoparticles were used effectively for hydrodechlorination
of trichloroethylene (TCE) [ 407,408]. Mineralization of
organic dyes was accelerated in one study by using filmsof manganese oxide (MnO
2) nanoparticles and hydrogen
peroxide [ 409]. Similarly, MnO2hierarchical hollow nanos-

bilityofself-assembledmonolayersonmesoporoussupportsfor removing anions and radionuclides was also evalu-ated by many researchers [ 412,413]. Molecularly imprinted

nanoparticles could be used for decontaminating a broad
range of organic contaminants as highlighted in one study[415].
3.4.5. Membranes. The immobilization of metallic nanopar-
ticles in membrane has also been proved effective for degra-dationanddechlorinationoftoxiccontaminants[ 416].Inor-
ganic membranes containing nano-TiO
2or modified nano-
TiO2have been used effectively for reductive degradation
of contaminants, particularly chlorinated compounds [ 417,
418].TheuseofTiO2immobilizedonapolyethylenesupport
andaTiO2slurryincombinationwithpolymericmembranes
has proved very effective in degrading 1,2-dichlorobenzeneandpharmaceuticals,respectively[ 419,420].
Polyethersulfonecompositemembraneswithnano-TiO

as additive showed higher fluxes and enhanced antifouling
properties[ 421–423].Ceramiccompositemembranemadeof
TiO2nanoparticles inside a tubular Al2O3substrate showed
improved water quality and flux compared to Al2O3mem-
branes [424]. By doping TiO2nanoparticles to the Al2O3
membrane, it was possible to control the membrane fouling

Cellulose acetate membrane laden with nZVI was found
effective in dechlorination of TCE [ 426]. A reactive mem-
brane of bimetallic nZVI and Pt
0nanoparticles was found
to be very effective at reducing TCE [ 427]. Bimetallic Fe/Ni
and Fe/Pd nanoparticles incorporated in nZVI as polymer–inorganic porous composite membranes have been suc-cessfully used for the reductive degradation of halogenatedorganicsolvents[ 428–430].Polyvinylidenefluoridefilmcon-

to reduce the dissolved organic carbon better than theuncoated membrane enhancing the degradation of NOM[273,433]. Finally, ceramic composite membranes of TiO

In the context of improving the UF processes for water
treatmentcontainingorganicandinorganicsolutes,dendriticpolymersareusedaswater-solubleligandsforradionuclides

of 4-nitrophenol was seen when using a composite mem-
brane composed of alumina and polymers through layer-by-layer adsorption of polyelectrolytes and citrate-stabilized
Au nanoparticles [ 89]. Finally, the addition of metal oxide
nanoparticles including silica, TiO

to polymeric ultrafiltration membranes has helped reducing
fouling[441–445].
4. Conclusions and Perspectives
Safe water has become a competitive resource in many
parts of the world due to increasing population, prolongeddroughts, climate change, and so forth. Nanomaterials haveunique characteristics, for example, large surface areas, size,shape,anddimensions,thatmakethemparticularlyattractivefor water/wastewater treatment applications such as disin-fection, adsorption, and membrane separations. The reviewof the literature has shown that water/wastewater treatment
using nanomaterials is a promising field for current and
futureresearch.

Electrospinning offers the way to modify the surface
properties of nanomaterials and different nanofibrous fil-ters have successfully been used as antifouling water fil-tration membranes. They have extremely high surface-to-volume ratio and porosity, are very active against water-
borne pathogens, less toxic with minimum health risks,
and provide solutions to ensure safe water. It is very easyto dope functional nanomaterials to form multifunctionalmedia/membrane filters with increased reactivity and selec-tivityfordifferentcontaminants.Althoughtheseelectrospunnanofibersarepreparedbysimpleandcost-effectivemethod,their manufacturing at industrial scale is still a challengeand it is vital to consider the subject from an engineeringaspect. The use of nanofibrous composites membranes forwater/wastewatertreatmentisverylimitedandastand-alonesystem (Figure 3) is proposed for removing all types of
contaminants including bacteria/viruses, heavy metals andions,andcomplexorganiccompounds.10 AdvancesinMaterialsScienceandEngineering

The use of nanofibers and composite nanostructures
membranes can help degrade a wide range of organic andinorganic contaminants in real field applications. The betterunderstanding of the formation of nanocomposites mem-branes will certainly be a step towards improving the per-formance of multifunctional nanocomposites membranes.The pattern of nanoparticles within the host matrices ofmembranes and changes in the structures and propertiesof both nanomaterials and host matrices could be amongthe priority concerns in the real field applications of thenanofibrousmembranesforwater/wastewatertreatment.
