Opinion on the personal use of hair dyes and cancer risk 
3 1. BACKGROUND  
 
The Scientific Committee on Cosmetics and Non Food Products intended for Consumers 
(SCCNFP) adopted an opinion on “The use of Perm anent Hair Dyes and Bladder Cancer Risk” 
during the 17th plenary meeting of 12 June 2001 (SCCNFP/0484/01), updated on  23 April 2004 
by means of the written procedure (SCCNFP/0797/04) . In its opinion the SCCNFP stated that 
the European Commission should take further step s to control the use of hair dye chemicals 
since the potential risks of using this category of substances give cause for concern.  This opinion was the basis for the Opinion of the SCCNFP  adopted during the 22
nd plenary 
meeting of 17 December 2002 on “Assessment Stra tegies for Hair Dyes” (SCCNFP/0553/02). 
After discussion within the European Commission and with Member States and stakeholders a 
step-wise strategy was established to regulate all hair dyes listed as ingredients in cosmetic products.   Recently, the European Commission received publica tions on the possible link of occupation and 
bladder cancer, personal hair dye use and bl adder cancer, hair-colouring products and non-
Hodgkin’s Lymphoma as well as hair dye use and adult Acute Leukaemia.   
2. TERMS OF REFERENCE  
 
1. On the basis of currently available informati on and taken into account the data provided, the 
SCCP is asked if the data provided in th e attached publications change the overall 
assessment of the use of hair dyes and cancer  risk as stated in the opinion SCCNFP/0484/01, 
updated in the opinion SCCNFP/0797/04? 
 2. On the basis of currently available informa tion and taken into account the data provided, 
does the SCCP recommend any other requirements for assessing hair dyes than already recommended in its opinion “Assessment St rategies for Hair Dyes” (SCCNFP/0553/02, 
Opinion of the SCCNFP  adopted during the 22
nd plenary meeting of 17 December 2002)? 
 
 
3. OPINION  
 
Professor Elsebeth Lynge (Unive rsity of Copenhagen) and Professor Tore Sanner (member of 
SCCP) were asked to review and assess if pers onal use of hair dyes represent a cancer hazard. 
Based on a review of different  types of cancer it was decided that the assessment should 
concentrate on leukaemia and bladder cancer. The results are summarized in section 3.3. Tables.   
3.1. Leukaemia 
 
Cohort studies 
 
Grodstein et al.  (1994) using the Nurses Health Study (cohort study of 99,067 women aged 30-
55 years in 1976 followed to 1990), reported no incr ease in the risk of chronic lymphocytic 
leukaemia (RR=0.6; 0.3-1.5, 8 cases) or other leuk aemia (R=0.8; 0.3-1.9, 8 cases) and the use of 
permanent hair dyes. SCCP/0930/05 
 
Opinion on the personal use of hair dyes and cancer risk 
4  
Altekruse et al.  (1999) reported in a cohort study (CPSII, 547,586 women, enrolled 1982, 
followed to 1994) some indication for a possible increased risk of death from all leukaemia among women using permanent hair dyes (RR=1.1;  0.9-1.3, 207 cases). The risk increased with 
duration of use: 1 – 9 years RR=0.9 (0.7- 1.2, 69 cases), 10 – 19 years RR=1.2 (0.9-1.5, 78 
cases), 20+ years RR=1.3(1.0-1.7, 60 cases), p-value for trend 0.04.    
Case control studies 
 
In a hospital-based case-control study (101 matche d pairs) of acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia 
in the Baltimore (USA) area, publishe d only as an abstract, Markowitz et al.  (1985) found a 
significant positive association with hair-dye use (OR=3.1). There was, however, no difference 
between regular use (at least once a year) (OR=2.7) and less frequent use (OR=2.2) [95% confidence intervals and number of cases not presented].  Cantor et al.  (1988) carried out a population-based cas e-control study of hair-dye use among 578 
men with leukaemia and 1245 population controls  in Iowa and Minnesota, USA, in 1980-83. 
Significantly raised ORs were found for leukaemia (1.8; 1.1-2.7) in association with personal use 
or other potential exposure to hair tints, any hair colouring product or hair dyes. An elevated risk 
was also found here for the dysmyelopoietic s yndrome (may develop to myeloid leukaemia), 
RR=2.9 (1.2-7.1).    A population-based case-control study carried out  in eastern Nebraska, USA, during 1983-86 
investigated use of hair colouring products am ong a total of 37 male and 19 female cases of 
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and 725 male and 707 female residential controls who could be 
interviewed (Zahm et al.,  1992). Use of any hair dye was not associated with chronic 
lymphocytic leukaemia in either women (1.0; 0.3-2.6, 19 cases) or men (1.0; 0.2-3.8, 37 cases).  Mele et al.  (1994) using patients from three hospitals  in Italy found no statistically significant 
increased risks for acute myeloid leukaemia, acu te lymphocytic leukaemia or chronic myeloid 
leukaemia. The study involved primarily women a nd semi-permanent and permanent hair dyes 
(the two types are not analyzed separately). The authors state that the results were consistent 
with a modest effect of dark hair dye use: > 10 year use. Acute myeloid leukaemia 1.7 (0.7-4.0, 
25 cases), acute lymphocytic leukaemia 1.9 (0.5- 7.9, 6 cases), and chronic myeloid leukaemia 
1.2 (0.4-3.9 13 cases). No excess ri sk was found for refractory anaemia with excess of blasts, 
RAEB or in acute promyelocytic leukaemia (Mele et al. 1995). 
 Elevated risks for the dysmyelopoietic syndrome we re also found in two studies from Japan with 
relative risks among women of 2.50 (0.97-6.41, 29 cases) (Ido et al, 1996) and 2.88 (1.38-6.01, 
25 cases) (Nagata et al.  1999), respectively. In the study by Nagata and co-workers the RR=1.99 
(1.17-3.38, 34 cases) for both sexes together. The risk  increased with duration of use (10+ years 
RR=4.10; 1.64-10.23) and total frequency of us e (70+ RR=3.08; 1.22-7.75). No increase was 
found in a small group of men (OR=1.23; 0.53-2.88, 9 cases). It is uncertain whether or not there is an overlap between the cases from the two Japanese studies. Personal communication to the author was not answered.   The risk of chronic lymphatic leukaemia was el evated in two case-control studies. In a study 
from Yugoslavia it was found that RR 1.97 (1.08-3.59, 11 cases) (Markovic-Denic et al.  1995). 
In a larger study from Spain, no increase in the risk of all lymphomas was found. However, the SCCP/0930/05 
 
Opinion on the personal use of hair dyes and cancer risk 
5 risk of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia wa s increased, RR=2.3 (1.1-4.7, 37 cases). The risk 
increased with time exposed and with lifetime dose. The risk was only significantly increased among those starting to use hair dyes befo re 1980 (RR=3.5; 1.5-7.8, 27 cases) and not among 
those starting after 1980 (RR=1.5; 0.6-3.6, 10 cases). The risk was significantly increased among 
those using permanent hair dyes (RR=3.4; 1.4-7.8, 35 cases). The numbers using semi-permanent hair dyes were to small to draw any conclusion (RR=1.6; 0.4-6.6, 3 cases). (Benavente et al. In press). 
 Miligi et al.  (1999) found no increase among hair dye use and leukaemia (0.9; 07-1.3, number of 
cases not given). The risk was, however, increased among women using dark permanent products (2.0; 1.1-3.8, number of cases not given).   Björk et al.  (2001) found no relationship between us e of hair dyes and chronic myeloid 
leukaemia (0.35; 0.18-0.68, 25 cases).   Rauscher et al.  (2004) performed a population-based case- control study of acute leukaemia in 
1986–1989 in USA and Canada. There was a modest positive association for ever use of hair 
dyes (OR= 1.3; 1.0-1.8, 185 cases). The incr ease was stronger among those only using 
permanent dye (OR=1.6; 1.1-2.4, 87 cases). The risk increased for long duration (15+ years) of 
use (OR=1.9; 1.1- 3.6, 39 cases). The greatest odds ra tio was for 15 or more years of using hair 
dyes up to six times per year (OR=2.4; 1.0-5.8, 20 cases). First use before 1970 represented a 
higher risk (OR=1.7; 1.0-3.0, 45 cases) than fi rst used after 1979 (OR=1.2; 0.51-2.9, 13 cases). 
When stratified by leukaemia subtype, ever use of  permanent hair dyes was associated with an 
OR of 1.6 (1.1- 2.5) for myelocytic leukaemia, and the trends in risk with duration and frequency 
were similar to the trends observed for all leukaemia subtypes combined. For lymphoblastic 
leukaemia, the OR for ever use of permanent dyes was 2.0 (0.9- 4.6). There was a suggestion of 
a dose response for both duration and frequency, with the OR reaching 4.6 (1.5-14) for 15 or 
more years of use and the OR reaching 3.8 (1.2-12)  for six or more applications per year. The 
authors conclude that long duration of permanent dye  use may have a larger impact on the risk of 
adult acute leukaemia and other haematopoietic cancers than prior epidemiological data suggest.   
Conclusion 
Any use of hair dyes 
Twelve case-control studies have been evaluate d. 5 studies, 1 from Nebr aska concerning chronic 
lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) with 56 cases (Zahm et al.  1992), 3 from Italy on acute myeloid 
leukaemia (AML) acute promyelocytic leukaemia  (APL) and all leukaemia, number of cases 
were not available Mele et al.  1994, 1995 and Miligi et al.  1999), and 1 from Sweden with 25 
cases on chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) (Björk et al.  2001), where negative.  
 Seven studies were evaluated as positive. 3 studies were from USA. The first from Baltimore was only published in an abstract (acute non-ly mphocytic leukaemia, ANLL) and no confidence 
interval or numbers of cases were given (Markowitz et al.  1985). In the study by Cantor et al. 
(1988) from Iowa and Minnesota the risk was 1.8 (1.1-2.7) (all leukaemia). A recent and large 
study from USA and Canada (Raucher et al.  2004) was only borderline positive (1.3; 1.0-1.8, 
185 cases) (acute leukaemia, AL). One study from Spain was positive (2.3; 1.1-4.7) (CLL) 
(Benavente et al.  In press) as was 1 study from Y ugoslavia (1.97; 1.08-3.59) (CLL) (Markovic-
Denic et al.  1995) and 2 studies on myelodysplastic syndr ome from Japan showed that the risk 
was increased 2 – 3 times (Ido et al.  1996, Nagata et al.  1999).

6 Use of permanent hair dyes 
Two cohort studies were evaluated. A small cohort study was negative (16 cases) (CLL and 
other leukaemia) (Grodstein et al.  1994), while a larger study was borderline positive (1.1; 0.9-
1.3, 207 cases) (all leukaemia) with a significantly  positive trend for year of use (p=0.04) 
(Altekruse et al.  1999).  
 Four case-control studies were evaluated. One study from Nebraska wa s negative (0.8; 0.1-4.0) 
(CLL) (Zahm et al.  1992). One study from Italy was equivocal as it was overall negative (1.2; 
0.9-1.7) (all leukaemia) while an increased risk was found among those using dark permanent products (2.2; 1.1-3.8) (Miligi et al.  1999). Two recent studies, one from USA and Canada (1.6; 
1.1-2.4, 87 cases) (AL) (Rauscher et al.  2004) and one from Spain (3.4; 1.4-7.8) (CLL) 
(Benavente et al.  In press) were positive. 
 Although the published data are conflicting, especiall y, when all types of hair dyes is considered, 
it is concluded that some studies indicate exce ss risks for acute leukaemia and chronic lymphoid 
leukaemia for users of hair dyes.      
3.2. Bladder cancer      
 
Any use of hair dyes. Nine case-control studies  were evaluated. All were negative. No cohort 
studies were available. It was therefore decided only to discuss on Use of permanent hair dyes.    
Cohort studies 
 
A cohort study from 1979 (Hennekens et al. ) based on Nurses’ Health Study was negative 
(RR=0.62; 0.22-1.58, 5 cases).  Henley and T hun (2001) reported a cohort study (CPSII, 547,586 
women, enrolled 1982 and followed to 1998). The risk  of bladder cancer was not influenced by 
the use of permanent hair dyes (RR=1.08; 0.84- 1.38, 92 cases). Neither was there any risk 
among non-smokers (RR=0.92; 0.61-1.40, 28 cases. No effect was found in relation to the 
duration of hair dye use.   
Case-control studies 
 
Stavraky et al.  (1981) found no effect in women in a study involving 12 cases of kidney cancer 
and 23 cases of bladder cancer (RR=1.1; 0.4-2.8) in a study from Canada.  Gago-Dominguez et al.  (2001a). A population-based case-c ontrol study was conducted in Los 
Angeles, California, which involved 1,514 incident  cases of bladder cancer and an equal number 
of age-, sex- and ethnicity-matched controls . Information on personal use of hair dyes was 
obtained from 897 cases and their matched contro ls. The main results after adjustment for 
cigarette smoking are presented in Table 1. SCCP/0930/05

  Gago-Dominguez et al.  (2001b) published a letter showing that the hair dye bladder cancers 
were associated with the N-acetyltransfer ase 2 (NAT2) phenotype “Slow acetylators”. 
 The above findings have been further expl ored in a later publication by Gago-Dominguez et al.  
(2003). The authors have previously reported perm anent hair dye use to be a significant risk 
factor for bladder cancer in US women. They ha ve also examined N-acetyltransferase-2 (NAT2) 
phenotype in relation to the hair dye–bladder can cer relationship, and found that the association 
is principally confined to NAT2 slow acetylators (Gago-Dominguez et al. 2001b). In the present 
study, the possible modifying effects of a se ries of potential arylamine-metabolizing 
genotypes/phenotypes (GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1, NAT1, NAT2, CYP1A2) on the permanent hair dye–bladder cancer association among female participants (159 cases, 164 controls) of the Los Angeles Bladder Cancer Study have been further studied.  Among NAT2 slow acetylators, exclusive permanen t hair dye use was associated with an 
OR=2.9 (CI=1.2–7.5, 33/22) for bladder cancer. Th e corresponding odds ratio in NAT2 rapid 
acetylators was 1.3 (CI=0.6–2.8, 32/26). Frequenc y and duration-related dose–response 
relationships confined to NAT2 slow acetylators were all positive and statistically significant. 
No such associations were noted among NAT 2 rapid acetylators. Among CYP1A2 ‘slow’ 
individuals, exclusive permanent hair dye use was associated with an OR=2.5 (CI=1.0–6.1, SCCP/0930/05 
 
Opinion on the personal use of hair dyes and cancer risk 
8 37/17) for bladder cancer. The corresponding OR  in CYP1A2 ‘rapid’ individuals was 1.3 
(CI=0.6–2.7). Frequency- and duration related dose– response relationships confined to CYP1A2 
‘slow’ individuals were all positive and statistically  significant. No such associations were noted 
among CYP1A2 ‘rapid’ individuals (all data above was adjusted for smoking). Among lifelong 
non-smoking women, individuals exhibiting the non- NAT1*10  genotype showed a statistically 
significant increase in bladder cancer risk associ ated with exclusive permanent hair dye use 
(OR=6.8 (CI=1.7–27.4, 10/11). The comparable OR in individuals with the NAT1*10  genotype 
was 1.0 (CI=0.2–4.3, 5/8). Similarly, all freque ncy- and duration related dose–response 
relationships confined to individuals possessing the non- NAT1*10  genotype were positive and 
statistically significant. On the other hand, individuals of NAT1*10  genotype exhibited no such 
associations.  Comment: The above data strengthen the finding of increased risk for bladder cancer among 
users of permanent hair dyes and implicate aryl amines contained in hair dye solution as the 
putative carcinogenic substances responsible for bladder cancer.  Andrew et al.  (2004) studied the use of hair dyes a nd bladder cancer in New Hampshire. Among 
users of permanent hair dyes the risk of bl adder cancer showed a non-significant increase among 
women (RR=1.5; 0.8-2.7, 32 cases), while no in crease was found among a small group of men 
(RR=0.6; 0.2-1.5, 7 cases). The risk of bladder cancer was increased by a factor of 2.3 (1.1-4.6, 
22 cases) among women that had started to use pe rmanent hair dyes before the age of 37. No 
difference was found between women that had st arted to use permanent hair dyes before 1975 
(1.5; 0.8-2.9, 22 cases) compared with those that  started after 1975 (2.0; 0.8-5.4, 10 cases). The 
risk was increased by a factor of 2.6 (1.1-6.3, 14 cases) among those that started more than 31 
years ago. The risk showed a non-significant increas e with the total uses over lifetime: 1-35 uses, 
1.7 (0.7-3.9, 13 cases); 35-282 uses, 1.3 (0.6-2.8, 12 cases); >282 uses, 3.3 (0.9-13, 7 cases).  No increase was found in an unpublished case-control study from Spain (Kogevinas et al. 2005).  Use of any hair dye (OR=0.8, 95%CI 0.5-1.4, 78 cases) or of permanent hair dyes (OR=0.8, 0.5-
1.5, 60 cases) was associated with no increased risk. None of the polymorphisms examined 
modified the hair dye-associated risk, however la gged analysis suggested an increased risk for 
permanent hair dye use among carriers of the NAT1*10  allele (OR= 3.6, 1.0-13.0; p-value for 
interaction= 0.06).    
Conclusion 
 
Two cohort studies from USA did not show any e ffect of permanent hair dye use and bladder 
cancer. One of the studies involved only 7 cases.  The other involved 92 cases. It should be noted 
that the frequency of use or number of years used is not available.  A case control study from Canada (Stavraky et al. 1981) involving 12 cases of kidney cancer and 
23 cases of bladder cancer was negative. Two more recent studies from USA are considered positive. The one study (Gago-Dominguez et al . 2001) was from Los Angeles involved 82 
women using permanent hair dyes showed an in creased risk of bladder cancer (RR=1.9; 1.1-3.3) 
while no increase was found among 13 males (R= 0.8; 0.4-2.0). The risk among women increased 
with increasing use. This study is further s upported from studies on implicating arylamines 
contained in hair dye solution as the putative carcinogenic substances responsible for bladder 
cancer. It is also supported by a sma ller study from New Hampshire (Andrew et al.  2004). On SCCP/0930/05 
 
Opinion on the personal use of hair dyes and cancer risk 
9 the other hand, a recent unpublishe d study from Spain (Kogevinas et al. 2005) appeared to be 
negative.  It is concluded that there is an indication of  excess risk of bladder cancer for women in USA 
using permanent hair dyes frequently and for long time.

3.4. Conclusion 
 
1. SCCP has reviewed and assed if use of hair dyes represent a cancer risk. It was decided that 
the assessment should concentrate on leukaemia and bladder cancer since no evidence was found linking personal use of hair dyes to a cancer risk at other sites. 
• Although the published data are conflicting, esp ecially, when all types of hair dyes is 
considered, it is concluded that some studi es indicate excess risks for acute leukaemia 
and chronic lymphoid leukaemia for users of hair dyes. 
• It is concluded that there is an indication of excess risk of bladder cancer for women in 
USA using permanent hair dyes frequently and for long time.  
 2. SCCP does not recommend any other requireme nts for assessing hair dyes than already 
recommended in its opinion “Assessment St rategies for Hair Dyes” (SCCNFP/0553/02, 
Opinion of the SCCNFP  adopted during the 22
nd plenary meeting of 17 December 2002).
