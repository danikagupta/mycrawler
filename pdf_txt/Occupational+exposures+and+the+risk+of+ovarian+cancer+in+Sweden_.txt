OBJECTIVES:  We updated the Swedish component of the Nordic Occupational Cancer (NOCCA) Study 
through 2009 in order to investigate the incidence of mesothelioma of the peritoneum and pleura in both gen -
ders, and explored occupational exposures that may be associated with mesothelioma. 
METHODS:  The Swedish component of the NOCCA Study includes 6.78 million individuals. Data from this 
cohort were linked to the population-based Swedish Cancer Registry and Swedish Total Population Registry 
for three periods between 1961 and 2009, and then further linked to the Swedish NOCCA job-exposure ma -
trix, which includes 25 carcinogenic substances and the corresponding exposure levels for 280 occupations. 
Multivariate analysis was used to calculate standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for mesothelioma of the peri -
toneum and pleura by gender, occupational category, carcinogenic substance, and for multiple occupational 
exposures simultaneously. 
RESULTS:  A total of 3,716 incident mesotheliomas were recorded (21.1% in women). We found a significant -
ly increased risk of mesothelioma in 24 occupations, as well as clear differences between the genders. Among 
men, increased risks of mesothelioma of the pleura were observed in male-dominated occupations, with the 
greatest elevation of risk among plumbers (SIR, 4.99; 95% confidence interval, 4.20 to 5.90). Among women, 
increased risks were observed in sewing workers, canning workers, packers, cleaners, and postal workers. In 
multivariate analysis controlling for multiple occupational exposures, significant associations were only ob -
served between asbestos exposure and mesothelioma. 
CONCLUSIONS:  Asbestos exposure was associated with mesothelioma incidence in our study. The asbestos 
ban of 1982 has yet to show any clear effect on the occurrence of mesothelioma in this cohort. Among wom -
en, the occupations of canning workers and cleaners showed increased risks of mesothelioma of the pleura 
without evidence of asbestos exposure.

INTRODUCTION
Mesothelioma is a very aggressive malignancy that occurs in 
the peritoneum and pleura, and more rarely in the pericardium. 
It is most often linked to occupational asbestos exposure and 
was classified as an occupational disease in the 1950s [1]. Me -
sothelioma has a poor prognosis, with most patients dying with -
in one year of diagnosis [2], and a long latency period of up to 
40 years [3]. The incidence of mesothelioma varies; its incidence 
in developed countries such as Belgium, Britain, and Australia 
exceeds 30 cases per one million inhabitants [4], and in Swe -Correspondence:  Elisabete Weiderpass

den approximately 12 cases are diagnosed per one million in -
habitants (approximately 120 cases per year) [5]. 
Mesothelioma development is most strongly associated with 
exposure to asbestos types from the amphibole family, of which 
crocidolite was the most prevalent type used in Sweden. There -
fore, occupations in which crocidolite was used or manipulated 
constituted high-risk occupations. In some industries, such as 
asbestos-cement production, asbestos types from both the ser -
pentine and amphibole families were used [6]. 
Asbestos was banned in Sweden in 1982 [7], and strict pre -
cautions and security requirements have been introduced for 
occupations that include the handling of or exposure to asbes -
tos, such as asbestos removal. A sharp decline in the annual in -
cidence rate of mesothelioma was observed in 2008 [8], but in 
the last two years its incidence has started to increase again. 
One of the reasons for this recent increase may be the long la -
tency period of mesothelioma; however, since asbestos has been 
absent from the Swedish labor market for 35 years, one would 
expect the number of mesothelioma cases to be on the decline. 
Instead, at present more people in Sweden die from mesotheli -
oma than from accidents in the workplace [9]. 
Only a limited number of occupations have been reported to 
confer a significant excess risk of mesothelioma [10], and no 
connection between mesothelioma and any occupational expo -
sure besides asbestos, such as air pollution [11], has been scien -
tifically proven. In the UK and Finland, it has been estimated 
that 97% [12] and 90% [13] of mesothelioma cases, respec -
tively, are related to asbestos exposure, and most of these are 
caused by occupational exposure. 
The most recent report on the Nordic Occupational Cancer 
(NOCCA) cohort covered the period from 1961 to 2005 and is 
the largest study of occupational cancer in the Nordic countries 
published so far. It included 2.8 million diagnosed cases of can -
cer in the five Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Nor -
way, and Sweden) and reported mesothelioma cases in occupa -
tions where asbestos exposure is not usually considered to be 
present [14]. A total of 40.6% of the mesothelioma cases in the 
NOCCA cohort were from Sweden (2,521 men and 548 wom -
en), and a statistically significant excess risk of mesothelioma 
among men in Sweden was found in 12 of the 53 occupational 
categories considered [14]. However, the proportion of women 
diagnosed with mesothelioma was also quite high.
Asbestos exposure alone probably cannot explain the rela -
tively high proportion of women with mesothelioma in Swe -
den, since disease onset was found to occur at approximately 
50 years of age, which is much earlier than the onset for men 
[5]. Moreover, asbestos exposure during the period covered by 
the NOCCA Study was most common in male-dominated oc -
cupations (e.g., insulators, ship builders, car mechanics, asbestos 
cement manufacturing, construction workers, etc.) [15]. How -ever, since 17.8% of the mesothelioma cases in the latest Swed -
ish NOCCA Study occurred in women [14], it is important to 
identify alternative direct or indirect causal factors. 
Therefore, we updated the data in the Swedish component of 
the NOCCA Study through 2009 in order to investigate the in -
cidence of mesothelioma of the peritoneum and pleura in both 
genders, and to explore occupational exposures other than as -
bestos that may be associated with mesothelioma. We also in -
vestigated whether mesothelioma incidence during the period 
from 1961 to 2009 differed among occupations and whether it 
was possible to see any effect of the Swedish asbestos ban of 
1982.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Swedish Nordic Occupational Cancer Study
The NOCCA Study was started to investigate occupational 
exposures and their associations with cancer incidence. The Swe-
dish component of the NOCCA Study consists of individuals 
who participated in one of the following Swedish population 
censuses: 1960, 1970, 1980, or 1990. The 1960, 1970, and 1990 
censuses took place on November 1, while the 1980 census 
took place on September 15. The Swedish NOCCA Study in -
cluded 6.78 million individuals aged 30 to 64 years who were 
still alive and living in Sweden on January 1 of the year follow -
ing the census. Each individual’s personal identification num -
ber, name, address, marital status, education, economic activity, 
occupation, and industry were recorded, and the occupations 
were then coded, as described previously by Pukkala et al. [14], 
according to a Swedish adaptation of the Nordic Occupational 
Classification [16], which is a Nordic adaptation of the Interna -
tional Standard Classification of Occupations from 1958 [17]. 
Update of cancer incidence through 2009
Cancer incidence was determined through record linkage be -
tween the Swedish NOCCA database and the population-based 
Swedish Cancer Registry. The present report updated informa -
tion on cancer incidence in subjects included in the Swedish 
NOCCA Study through 2009, thus covering the period from 
1961 to 2009. Follow-up was done over three time periods: 
1961-1974, 1975-1989, and 1990-2009. Mesothelioma cases 
were classified into mesothelioma of the peritoneum (Interna -
tional Classification of Diseases, 7th revision [ICD-7] code 158) 
and of the pleura (ICD-7 code 162.2). Histological results were 
coded with three digits by the Swedish Cancer Registry (code 
776), according to the official codes of the World Health Orga -
nization [18]. 
Study entry was set at January 1 of the year after the first avail -
able census in which an individual participated. Person-years 3Plato N et al. : Occupation and mesothelioma
were accumulated until the date of emigration, death, or the end 
of the study period (December 31, 2009), whichever came first. 
Dates of death and emigration were retrieved from the Swedish 
Total Population Registry. 
Standardized incidence ratio 
The observed number of mesothelioma cases and person-years 
were stratified into 5-year age categories (30-34, 35-39,  … , ≥ 85 
years) and 5-year calendar periods by gender and occupational 
category. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated 
using cancer incidence rates for the entire Swedish population 
by gender, age, and calendar time as reference rates. The exact 
95% confidence interval (CI) was defined assuming a Poisson 
distribution of the observed number of cases.
The Nordic Occupational Cancer job-exposure matrix 
The NOCCA job-exposure matrix (NOCCA-JEM) contains 
combined information from all the Nordic countries. It includes 
25 carcinogenic substances with exposure levels for 280 occu -
pations based on exposure data from national exposure data -
bases and expert assessments available from 1945 to 1994 [19]. 
The NOCCA-JEM is quantitative; therefore, in principle it is 
possible to estimate the cumulative exposure (dose) of the 25 
included carcinogenic substances for the entire NOCCA cohort. 
The Finnish JEM (FINJEM) [20] was created by the Finnish 
Institute of Occupational Health in Helsinki, Finland. This is a 
generic quantitative JEM from 1945 onwards for 84 different 
outcomes, with exposures for almost 300 different occupations 
at 3-digit levels. This JEM is now used in many different coun -
tries. The FINJEM was used to construct national NOCCA JEMs 
for Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. The expo -
sure codes, definitions, and units of the carcinogenic substances 
included in the Swedish NOCCA-JEM can be found in Appen -
dix 1. The Swedish NOCCA-JEM uses the 3-digit occupation 
codes used in the Swedish adaptation of the Nordic Occupa -
tional Classification. The data of the Swedish NOCCA Study 
were linked to the Swedish NOCCA-JEM to determine the ex -
posures that occurred in the different occupations. Exposure in -
formation that went beyond the confines of the NOCCA-JEMs 
was obtained by an experienced occupational hygienist. Of the 
280 occupational codes in the Swedish NOCCA Study, 96 were 
rated for occupational exposure to carcinogenic substances in 
the Swedish NOCCA-JEM.
Finally, mesothelioma incidence was linked with the Swedish 
NOCCA-JEM [19] and the observed number of cases was re -
corded by gender and by exposure to the carcinogenic sub -
stances included in the Swedish NOCCA-JEM.
The Swedish NOCCA Study received ethics committee/insti -
tutional review board approval from the Forskningsetikkommit -
ten at the Karolinska Institutet (Dnr 03-466).RESULTS
A total of 3,716 cases of mesothelioma were diagnosed in 
the cohort of the Swedish NOCCA Study from 1961 to 2009, 
785 (21.1%) of which occurred in women. The vast majority of 
cases (89.7%) had mesothelioma of the pleura, while a small 
proportion was diagnosed with mesothelioma of the peritone -
um (10.3%). However, only 577 of the 3,334 cases of mesothe -
lioma of the pleura occurred in women (17.3%), as opposed to 
208 of the 382 (54.5%) cases of mesothelioma of the peritone -
um. We found a significant excess risk of incident mesothelioma 
of both the peritoneum and pleura in 24 of the 280 occupations 
considered. Differences in risk between the genders were also 
found. Five occupations showed an excess risk in women, but 
no excess risk in men (Tables 1 and 2).  
For men, the linkage of cancer incidence with the Swedish 
NOCCA-JEM resulted in the identification of 17 occupations 
with chemical exposure that conferred a significant excess risk 
of mesothelioma of the pleura, four of which also showed an 
excess risk of mesothelioma of the peritoneum: plumbers and 
pipe fitters (pleura: SIR, 4.99; 95% CI, 4.20 to 5.90; peritone -
um: SIR, 3.56; 95% CI, 1.31 to 7.76), painters (pleura: SIR, 
1.72; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16; peritoneum: SIR, 2.70; 95% CI, 
1.08 to 5.56), bricklayers (pleura: SIR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.07 to 
2.30; peritoneum: SIR, 5.42; 95% CI, 1.99 to 11.80), and insu -
lators (pleura: SIR, 10.9; 95% CI, 6.81 to 16.50; peritoneum: 
SIR, 64.70; 95% CI, 28.00 to 128.00) (Table 1, Appendix 2). 
T welve of the 17 occupations with excess risk are rated for as -
bestos exposure in the Swedish NOCCA-JEM. However, most 
of these occupations are also rated for other exposures in the 
Swedish NO  CCA-JEM. Moreover, the Swedish NOCCA-JEM 
indicates that the observed excess risk for mesothelioma of the 
pleura among mechanical engineers and technicians (SIR, 1.67; 
95% CI, 1.42 to 1.95); toolmakers, machine-tool setters, and 
operators (SIR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.77); chemical process 
workers (SIR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.20 to 3.54); paper pulp workers 
(SIR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.22 to 3.36); and stationary engine and re -
lated equipment operators (SIR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.79) is 
not sufficiently high to classify them as occupations that include 
asbestos exposure (Table 1). An elevated risk of mesothelioma 
of the pleura was also observed in two occupations that are not 
rated for chemical exposure in the Swedish NOCCA-JEM: ships’ 
engineers (SIR, 6.06; 95% CI, 3.65 to 9.46), and divers and pipe 
layers (SIR, 4.20; 95% CI, 1.14 to 10.7) (Table 1, Appendix 3). 
The highest risk of mesothelioma of the pleura was observ  ed for 
insulators (SIR = 10.9), and the largest number of cases was observ -
ed among mach  inery fitters and machi nery assemblers (n= 180).
When women with mesothelioma were linked to the Swed -
ish NOCCA-JEM, we observed an excess risk of mesothelioma 
of the pleura for one occupation rated for chemical exposure: 4Epidemiology and Health   2016;38:e2016039

sewing work (SIR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.27 to 3.39) (Table 2, Appen -
dix 4). We observed significant excess risks of mesothelioma of 
the pleura in two occupations not rated for chemical exposure 
in the Swedish NOCCA-JEM: canning workers (SIR, 4.90; 95% 
CI, 1.33 to 12.50) and cleaners (SIR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.31). 
In total, 208 women had mesothelioma of the peritoneum, of 
whom 104 were economically inactive. The other 104 women 
were distributed among 280 occupations, of which only two 
had a significant excess risk: sorting clerks and postal workers 
(SIR, 9.27; 95% CI, 1.12 to 33.50) and packers (SIR, 4.49; 95% 
CI, 1.22 to 11.50) (Table 2, Appendix 5). 
We examined the trends over the three follow-up periods: 1961-1974, 1975-1989, and 1990-2009. The significant excess 
risk of mesothelioma of the peritoneum was constant over time 
for plumbers and pipefitters as well as for electrical fitters and 
wiremen. For sheet metal workers and electrical fitters and wire -
men, we observed an increased risk during all three follow-up 
periods, while we observed a decreased risk for stationary en -
gine and related equipment operators, mechanical engineers 
and technicians, machinery fitters and machinery assemblers, 
welding and flame cutters, and ships’ engineers among men, 
and sewing work among women (Table 3). For mesothelioma 
of the peritoneum, we observed a decreased risk for insulators 
but no consistent trends for any other occupation (Table 4).5Plato N et al. : Occupation and mesothelioma
DISCUSSION
Mesothelioma is closely related to asbestos exposure [1,21]. 
Despite the ban on asbestos put in place in Sweden in 1982 [7], 
the incidence rate of mesothelioma increased in subsequent de -
cades, flattened out in 2000, and started to decrease after 2005 
[8]. A total of 3,716 individuals in the Swedish NOCCA Study 
were diagnosed with mesothelioma from 1961 to 2009. The 
predominant type of mesothelioma in both genders was meso -
thelioma of the pleura, which was also much more common in 
men than in women. The proportion of women with mesotheli -
oma of the pleura was 17.8%, but when mesothelioma of the peritoneum was included, the proportion of women with me -
sothelioma increased to 21.1%. Only 0.7% of all cases of me -
sothelioma are pericardial mesothelioma [22]. 
Men in traditionally male-dominated occupations, such as sheet 
metal workers, plumbers, welders, and others, had a significant -
ly increased risk, while we did not observe any cases of meso -
thelioma among women in those occupations. This is probably 
due to the fact that there are few women in these occupations, 
and that job activities and exposure patterns can differ between 
genders. In occupations dominated by women, significantly in -
creased risks were found among packers, sewing workers, clean -
ers, canning workers, and sorting clerks and postal workers. Sew -Table 3.  Observed number of mesotheliomas of the pleura among men and women in Sweden and SIRs for three time periods; 1961-1974,

ing work showed the highest increased risk of mesothelioma of 
the pleura in the first period (1961-1974) (SIR, 5.65; 95% CI, 
1.54 to 14.50), the second period (1975-1989) (SIR, 3.07; 95% 
CI, 1.40 to 5.83), and the full period (1961-2009) (SIR, 2.14; 
95% CI, 1.27 to 3.39). Sewing workers are exposed to fibers, 
but not to asbestos fibers. However, exposure to asbestos fibers 
in the textile industry did occur in two small workshops in Swe-
den after the Second World War (Professor S. Krantz, personal 
communication). It may be that the asbestos-containing brake 
shoes in the textile machines caused a background level of air -
borne asbestos fibers in the machine halls, as was shown in an 
Italian non-asbestos textile industry [23]. Male textile workers 
showed no increase in risk, but their work activities and expo -
sure may have been different. 
It is well known that textile workers have an increased risk of 
mesothelioma, as was seen in the US [24] and several other 
countries where asbestos fibers have been a part of the produc -
tion process. However, no studies have confirmed that exposure 
to textile fibers alone is carcinogenic. The traditional understand -
ing of mesothelioma incidence in women holds that they are 
exposed via their husbands; that is, men exposed to asbestos 
bring home asbestos fibers on their clothes, and their wives are 
then subjected to secondary asbestos exposure when they han -
dle or wash the clothes. However, we did not find any evidence 
of such a pattern in the present analysis. 
Linkage to the Swedish NOCCA-JEM led to some interesting 
results. T welve of the 17 occupations with excess mesothelioma 
risk were rated for asbestos exposure in the Swedish NOCCA-
JEM. Five occupations (mechanical engineers and technicians; 
toolmakers, machine tool setters and operators; chemical pro -
cess workers; paper pulp workers; and stationary engine and 
related equipment operators) were rated for chemical exposure 
in the Swedish NOCCA-JEM, but not for asbestos exposure. It 
is possible that asbestos exposure occurred in all of these occu -
pations, but that the Swedish NOCCA-JEM is not sensitive 
enough to rate them as such due to low asbestos prevalence 
(e.g., a total of 102,447 men had the occupational code of me -
chanical engineers and technicians in 1980). Moreover, these 
occupations contain many different activities and tasks that in -
clude low asbestos exposure. We excluded all occupations in 
the Swedish NOCCA-JEM with an exposure prevalence (pro -
portion of exposed individuals in a defined occupation) of less 
than 5% for all agents.
Asbestos use was highest in Sweden from 1965 to 1975. Due 
to a latency period of 30 to 40 years, we should not expect to 
observe many changes until the last of our three follow-up pe -
riods, during which we found an increased risk for sheet metal 
workers and electrical fitters.
The excess risk for women sewing workers in the first follow-
up period may have been due to exposure during the 1930s and 1940s, for which we do not have information. The same 
point can also be made for the other occupations that showed 
decreasing trends.
An important observation is that the following occupations 
rated for asbestos exposure in the Swedish NOCCA-JEM show-
ed no elevated risk in our data: chemical and cellulose process -
ing work and store and warehouse workers. Furnace men, non-
specific electrical and electronics workers, concrete and con -
struction workers, glass formers and cutters, paper and paper -
board workers, and chimney sweeps are all exposed to asbestos 
in the course of their work. Although they all showed an elevat -
ed risk of mesothelioma in our analysis, it was not statistically 
significant. An increased risk of mesothelioma has been observ-
ed in other studies among furnace men and chimney sweeps 
[13,25].
Male ships’ engineers, as well as divers and pipe layers, showed 
a significant excess risk of mesothelioma of the pleura, but in 
the Swedish NOCCA-JEM these occupations were not rated 
for any chemical exposure. Male ships’ engineers are more like -
ly to be exposed to asbestos [26].
Among women, canning workers, sorting clerks and postal 
workers, and packers are not exposed to asbestos, but we found 
a significant excess risk of mesothelioma of the pleura and peri -
toneum in these occupations. We have no explanation for these 
observations. Women working as sewing workers and cleaners 
also showed a significant excess risk of mesothelioma of the 
pleura. These occupations do include exposure to textile fibers, 
but no specific textile fiber has been correlated to mesothelio -
ma in the literature.
A total of 25.5% of the women with mesothelioma in the 
present study had mesothelioma of the peritoneum, compared 
to just 5.9% of the men. A change in the diagnostic procedures 
for peritoneal tumors in 1999 may indicate a possibility for 
misclassification before the year 2000 [27]. Several studies have 
shown that ovarian and gastrointestinal tumors may be misdi -
agnosed as mesothelioma of the peritoneum and vice versa 
[28-30]. The distinction between ovarian cancer and mesotheli -
oma of the peritoneum may also be difficult to detect. A signifi -
cant excess risk of ovarian cancer has been found among textile 
workers, graphic workers, packing workers, and workers in the 
telegraph and telephone industry (a subgroup of postal work -
ers) in Sweden [31], corresponding to employment in both 1960 
and 1970. This is in agreement with our observations of excess 
risk in this study, but no reports have described potential asbes -
tos exposure within these occupations.
Asbestos is known to cause cancer in the wives and children 
of workers who are heavily exposed to asbestos [32,33]. This 
association may indicate that even household exposure may 
play a role in the development of asbestos-related cancers [34]. 
However, we have no indication as to why the women in the 7Plato N et al. : Occupation and mesothelioma
high-risk occupations observed in this study would have had 
higher levels of household exposure than women in other oc -
cupations.
Asbestos may have been a contaminant in talc, particularly 
before the mid-1970s [35]. Talc may be used for hygienic pur -
poses or may be introduced to the women peritoneum through 
powder-coated gloves used in surgical operations [36]. Heller et 
al. [37] found asbestos fibers in the ovarian tissue of 69% of 
women with household asbestos exposure and in 35% of those 
with a history of asbestos exposure. No associations were found 
between ovarian cancer and occupational exposure to talc in a 
Norwegian study of pulp and paper employees [38]. In a re -
view of occupational risk factors and ovarian cancer, Shen et al. 
[39] observed an excess risk of ovarian cancer associated with 
talc exposure. 
Exposure assessment is a weakness in most epidemiological 
studies. The NOCCA data lack information on smoking habits, 
but smoking is not expected to affect the risk of mesothelioma 
[40]. The Swedish NOCCA cohort was analyzed in conjunction 
with the Swedish NOCCA-JEM, which contains quantitative 
exposure levels for 25 carcinogenic agents for each year between 
1945 and 1994 for 96 different occupations. Never before has 
any linkage been made using such large and advanced materials. 
We have chosen to present the results as they are, in an ex -
ploratory manner, and acknowledge that some of the SIRs may 
have been significant by chance.
We were not able to determine which time scale (age, period, 
or cohort) influenced the observed trends. This is a weakness in 
this study and similar studies using SIRs as risk estimates.
Until recently, mesothelioma incidence has increased each 
year in Sweden, and it is therefore important to investigate the 
context of this increase, as we do not currently have a full un -
derstanding of the situation. There is no reason to believe that 
asbestos is the only causative agent of mesothelioma, or that 
the disease will disappear over time due to reduced asbestos 
exposure. Therefore, it is important to identify other potential 
airborne risk factors that may be liabilities to the working popu -
lation. The follow-up time after the asbestos ban in Sweden is 
too short (9-17 years in the latest follow-up period) to illustrate 
that effect.
