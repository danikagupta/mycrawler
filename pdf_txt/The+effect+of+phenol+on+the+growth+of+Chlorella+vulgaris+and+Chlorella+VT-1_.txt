1. Introduction
The widespread use of isopropanol (IPA), also known as
2-propanol or isopropyl alcohol, as a precursor or solvent inthe manufacture of pharmaceuticals, rubber, ﬁne chemicalsand textiles, for example, has resulted in the increased pro-duction of organic solvent-containing waste streams [1].I n
the UK, for example, isopropanol is the single biggest con-tributor (6.7%) to total volatile organic compound (VOC)emissions, which are the subject of increasingly stringentlegislation [2]. High concentrations of IPA are toxic to
most microorganisms due to its high oxygen demand andmembranedisruptivecharacteristicshenceitscommonplaceusage at high concentrations as a disinfectant [3]. Niemi
demonstrated that compounds containing isopropyl groupsare more resistant to microbial breakdown, suggesting thatIPA-containing waste streams may be more problematicthan 1-propanol-containing streams within the ecosystem

microorganisms than methanol- and ethanol-utilizers. How-ever, certain microorganisms may exhibit solvent-tolerantcharacteristics [5]although reports of such are mainly
limited to bacterial species, with over 70% coming fromPseudomonas sp., and little information currently available
on this phenomenon in eukaryotes.
Microalgal cultures have received much attention be-
cause of their potential in biotechnological applicationssuch as CO
2ﬁxation and the production of vitamins, phar-
maceuticals, ﬁne chemicals and food additives [6,7]. Many
of these compounds are synthesized in small quantitiesand display a low water solubility, which causes signiﬁ-cant process development issues for scale-up. Addition ofan organic phase to the growth medium may assist withproduct excretion and product extraction, allowing for en-hanced product recovery within the two-phase system [8].
Practically no studies exist regarding freshwater microalgalspecies, and speciﬁcally Chlorella vulgaris , in two-phase
conditions and the solvent-tolerance effects demonstratedin the presence of C3 alcohols such as 1-propanol orIPA.

example [9–12]. Although microalgae utilize light energy
andassimilateCO 2,themechanismsofheterotrophicgrowth
onorganiccarbonsourcesarestillnotfullyunderstood [13].
This is also the case for the biodegradation pathways formany solvents, such as IPA for example, although extensivetoxicity studies have been carried out on photoautotrophicunicellular microorganisms such as Chlamydomonas rein-
hardtii,Anabaena variabilis ,Monoraphidium braunii and
Dunaliella salina in the presence of C5–C8 alcohols and
C5–16 alkane solvents [14]. Previous work has also shown
thatthegrowthof Chlorella VT-1isreducedinthepresence
ofchlorophenolsalthoughnodegradationproductswerede-tected in the medium [15]. This strain also demonstrated
some level of tolerance to a range of chlorophenols, whereinitial growth was inhibited but the culture subsequently re-sumed growth at a rate comparable with chlorophenol-freeexperiments [16].
Here, we describe for the ﬁrst time the existence of an
environmental solvent-tolerant strain of C. vulgaris , termed
SDC1, and its ability to tolerate high IPA concentrations ofup to 16gl
−1. Identiﬁcation of the C. vulgaris SDC1 was
carried out by DNA extraction, agarose gel electrophore-sis, 16S rRNA PCR ampliﬁcation, direct DNA product se-quencingandsequenceanalysisasdescribedelsewhere [17].
In addition to survival in the presence of IPA, C. vulgaris
SDC1 was also capable of converting a proportion of theIPAwithinamineralsaltsmedium,andsubsequentlyexcret-ing the main aerobic breakdown product, acetone, into theextracellularmedium.Comparisonofgrowthcharacteristicshave also been drawn where µwas determined from the
slope of linear semilogarithmic plots of cell number duringexponential growth phase for both type and solvent-tolerantstrains of C. vulgaris in the presence of IPA.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Isolation of solvent-tolerant microalga
Samples of a bacterial/microalgal mixture were extracted
from a contaminated bioﬁlter containing a solvent-tolerantbacterial consortium treating high concentration IPA vapour(≥10,000ppm
v) at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK.
Aliquots of the bacterial/microalgal mixture were placedwithin250mlErlenmeyerﬂaskscontaining100mlMinimalSalts Medium (MSM) at pH 6 (3gl

Chlorella vulgaris Beijerinck (CCAP211/11B) was ob-
tained from the Culture Collection of Algae and Protozoa,Ambleside,CumbriaUKasacomparativetypeculturestrainfor solvent-tolerance experiments.
2.2. Cultivation of solvent-tolerant microalgae
An aliquot (1ml) of an axenic C. vulgaris SDC1 cell
suspension was taken from the enrichment ﬂasks describedabove and added to 250ml ﬂasks containing 8gl
−1IPA in
100ml MSM. Cultures were statically grown at 20◦C, gen-
tly bubbled with air containing 5% (v/v) CO 2and illumi-
natedwithcoolwhitelightfromﬂuorescentlightsat150 /H9262E
m−2s−1at the surface of the ﬂasks as described by [14]
with a 12-hlight:12-hdark cycle.
Samples (1ml) were extracted periodically and cell
growth measured. Cell number was calculated using ahaemocytometer slide and an Olympus CH-2 light mi-croscope to correlate optical density (OD) values to cellnumber. The OD was measured on a Hach DR/2000 Spec-trophotometer at λ=582nm. Additional microscopic
visualization and spread plates were carried out, prior toinitiation of each set of experiments, to ensure no microbialcontamination.
2.3. Solvent-tolerance experiments
250ml ﬂasks were set up in at least triplicate contain-
ing 2, 4, 8 or 16gl
−1IPA within 100ml MSM and 1ml
of algal inoculum (1 ×106cellsml−1) added. Flasks were
stoppered with foam bungs and cultivated at light intensityof 150 /H9262Em
−2s−1at the surface with 12-hlight:12-hdark
cycle for the duration of the experiment. In addition, trip-licate controls were set up containing the correspondingconcentration of IPA to allow correction for non-biologicalvolatilizationandphotodegradationofsolvent.Positivecon-trols comprising 1ml of either type culture C. vulgaris or
C.vulgaris SDC1inoculumandMSMwithoutsolventwere
also included. Triplicate samples of the cell suspensions(1ml) were taken at regular periods following thorough ag-itated mixing of reaction media for analysis.
2.4. Solvent concentration determination
Isopropanol (IPA) and acetone concentrations were de-
termined using a Shimadzu GC-17A Gas Chromatograph142 E. Mcevoy et al./Enzyme and Microbial Technology 35 (2004) 140–146
equipped with a Carbowax BP20 column (length =30m,
1/H9262m ﬁlm). Flow rate of He carrier gas was 10ml min−1,
the temperatures of the Flame Ionization Detection (FID)system and oven were 280 and 80
◦C, respectively. Injec-
tion port temperature was 270◦C and run time was 2min.

C. vulgaris SDC1 displayed healthier growth after 200h,
demonstrating that the majority of cells had not been irre-versibly damaged but were resistant to the solvent effects.Fig.1alsodemonstratesthattheﬁnalcelldensityobtainable

the presence of 16gl−1IPA, indicating a non-linear trend

4. Discussion
This work represents, not only the ﬁrst demonstration of
thegrowthcharacteristicsofthesolvent-tolerant C.vulgaris
SDC1 in the presence of high concentrations of IPA, butalso its ﬁrst comparison with a type C. vulgaris strain. The
growth of C. vulgaris SDC1 was successfully achieved in
a minimal salts medium rather than Bolds Basic, Sorokinand Krauss Media in the presence of up to 16gl
−1IPA.
The strain showed a more obvious biphasic growth patternwith increasing IPA feed concentrations but which wasprobably not due to shading and carbon dioxide limita-tion, which are common when the culture density increases[19]. An increase in IPA feed concentration inhibited the
growth of both the environmental and type strains of C.
vulgaris although the type strain was more sensitive to
the presence of even low concentrations of IPA than thesolvent-tolerant SDC1 strain, whose growth appeared morerobust. This is clear from the lethal dose values calculatedfor both strains, with SDC1 exhibiting an LD
50more than
three-fold higher than the type strain and hence indicatingits inherent solvent-tolerance. Since this strain was isolatedfrom a gas-phase bioﬁlter treating high-concentration sol-vent wastestreams, it is comprehensible that the long-termselection process has insured that cells survive and growin what would otherwise be a toxic environment [20]. This
approach may also yield more robust strains demonstratingimproved degradation of a range of toxins over time withinincreasingly extreme environments not usually capable ofsupporting signiﬁcant microbial growth.
Previous studies examining the toxicity effects of sol-
vents (to 4.6gl
−1) such as ethanol, methanol, dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) and dimethyl formamide (DMF) havedemonstrated a signiﬁcant reduction in speciﬁc growth ofC. vulgaris andSelenastrum capricornutum green algae
[21]. However, here we demonstrate the growth character-
istics ofC. vulgaris SDC1 in IPA concentrations of up to
16gl
−1and additionally elucidate that this strain is capable
of bioconversion of IPA to acetone. There appears to beno clear trend regarding the link between the presence ofacetone in the culture medium and initial IPA concentra-tion, since maximum acetone generation does not alwaysappear to coincide with the transition from exponentialgrowth into the stationary phase. Although a range of sol-vents have been examined for their toxicity effects on bothmarine and freshwater microalgal species, information issparse regarding IPA and acetone tolerance. In other al-gal species very little information is available on eitheralcohol- or acetone-converting enzymes, although Gron-dal et al. have partially puriﬁed an alcohol dehydrogenasefrom the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas moewusii
[22].
To date, over 70% of solvent-tolerant microbial strains
isolated belong to the genus Pseudomonas [23]. However,
here we report for the ﬁrst time the existence of the eukary-otic solvent-tolerant C. vulgaris SDC1 capable of growth in
IPA at concentrations of up to 16gl
−1and capable of su-
perior growth in the presence of solvent than its type col-lection counterpart. It has also been demonstrated that notonly does this C. vulgaris survive at these concentrations,
but also that it is capable of some degree of IPA biocon-version at up to 16gl
−1. Assumptions have been made that
solvent-tolerance may be due to a combination of mech-anisms such as solvent-tolerant enzyme utilization, mem-brane structure modiﬁcation, membrane pump activity anddiffusion in both bacterial and algal cells [24]. It is still
not categorically concluded whether this solvent-toleranceis inherent in all Chlorella species or whether it is an ef-
fect brought about by long-term environmental selection,as suggested for this SDC1 strain. However, initial com-parisons with a type C. vulgaris strain infer that it may be
somewhat inherent but that environmental selection causesconsiderable enhancement. In the future, the exploitation ofsuch solvent-tolerant photosynthetic microalgae offers sev-eral options in the ﬁeld of environmental biotechnology andbiocatalysis at both micro- and large-scale operation.
