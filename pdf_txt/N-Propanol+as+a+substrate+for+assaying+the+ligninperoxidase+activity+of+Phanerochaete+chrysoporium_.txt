The dye methyl red was completely decolorized at 24  h of incubation by Pseudomonas putida  MR1 
isolated from the dyestuff contaminated soil, collected from the textile industrial area of Sanganer, 
Jaipur , Rajasthan . Maximum decolorization was achieved when the isolate was incubated at 34 °C and 
pH 7. The decolorization was c onfirmed by studying the spectral analysis of the dye.  16S rRNA partial 
gene sequencing (772 bp) of isolate P. putida  MR1 was also performed and a phylogenetic tree was 
prepared . 
 
Key words: Pseudomonas putida  MR1, methyl red, decolorization . 
 
 
INTRODUCTI ON 
 
With the increasing  use of a wide variety of dyes,  
pollution by wastewater contaminated with dyestuff is 
becoming increasingly alarming (Moosvi et al ., 2005) . 
Synthetic dyes are extensively used in textile dyeing, 
paper printing, colour photography,  pharmaceutical, food, 
cosmetic and other industries (Rafi i et al., 1990 ; Singh et 
al., 2012 ; Sahasrabudhe and Pathade, 2012 ). 
Approximately 10,000 different dyes and pigments are 
used industrially, and over 0.7 million tonnes of synthetic 
dyes are produced annually worldwide. Major classes of 
synthetic dyes include azo, anthroquinone and triaryl 
methane dyes, and many of them are toxic or contain 
carcinogenic compounds with long turnover times 
(Hartman et al., 1978). It has been estimated that 10  to 
15% of d yes are lost in the effluent during dying 
processes (Zollinge r, 1987 ; Olligaard et al., 1999 ; Mathur, 
2012 ). 
Colour is the first contaminant  recognized in textile 
wastewater which affects aesthetics, water transparency 
and gas solubilities in water bodies (Faraco et al., 2009 ; 
Satyawali et al., 2009 ) and has to be  removed before discharging the wastewater into a receiving water body  
(Vijaya and Sandhya , 2003 ). 
Effluent discharged from the textile industries has 
variable characteristics in terms o f pH, disso lved oxygen, 
organic  and inorganic chemical content , etc. Pollution 
caused by dye effluent is mainly due to durability of the 
dyes in wastewater (Jadhav et  al., 2007).  Existing effluent 
treatment procedures utilize pH  neutralization, 
coagulation followed b y biological treatment, but they are 
unable to remove recalcitrant dyes completely from 
effluents.  This is because o f the color fastness, stability  
and resistance of dyes to degradation (Anjaneyulu et al., 
2005) .  
Bioremediation is the microbial clean up a pproach  
which can transform various toxic chemicals to less 
harmful forms. Several reports suggest the degradation 
of complex  organic substances, which can be brought 
about by bacterial  enzymes like oxygenase (Ren et al ., 
2006), laccase (Hatvani and Mecs, 2001) , lignin 
peroxidase (Shanmugam et al., 1999) , etc. Many 
microorganisms capable of decolorizing the dyes include

Gram - positive and negative bacteria (Sani and Baner jee, 
1999) and fungi (Balan and Monteneiro, 2001; Verma 
and Madamwar, 2005). Gram -negative bacteria are 
Pseudomonas , Acinetobacter , Alkaligenes , Moraxella , 
Achromabacter  and Flavobacterium spp. The Gram -
positives include all in the actinomycete line and th ey are 
Mycobacterium , Nocardia , Rhodococcus  and 
Arthrobacter spp. (Alexander, 1994).  
Pseudomonas putida  is a rod -shaped, flagellated, 
gram -negative bacterium that is found in most soil and 
water habitats where there is oxygen. It grows optimally 
at 25  to 30°C and can be easily isolated.  This bacteria is 
unique because it has most genes involved in breaking 
down aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbons. Thus, 
researchers are attracted to using P. putida  as the 
“laboratory ‘workhorse’ for research on bacteria -
remed iated soil processes”  (Kowalski, 2002) . There is 
great interest in sequencing the genome of P. putida  due 
to its strong effect in  bioremediation (Marcus, 200 3). 
The present study focuses on the use of P. putida  
strain MR1 isolated from the natural habitat of textile 
effluent environment, to degrade one of the frequently 
used  textile dye , that is, methyl red.  The effect of different 
physicochemical parameters on the growth and color 
removal were also studi ed. 
 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
Isolation and identifica tion  
 
The textile effluent contaminated soil and sludge samples collected 
from textile industrial region of Sanganer, Jaipur, Rajasthan, were 
used for isolat ion of dye decolorizing culture in mineral base 
medium with dye methyl red . One gram  different sam ples were 
used to inoculate the 100 mL of medium containing 10 mg of methyl 
red and the flasks were  incubated  in  the  orbital  shaker  at  37 °C  
for  24  h. After 24 h of incubation in the liquid broth, the grown cells 
were streaked on the MBM agar plate s with dye (100 mg L-1) in 
order to obtain the isolated colonies. The plates were incubated for 
24 h at 37 °C. The dye decolorizing isolates were identified on the 
basis of the appearance of a clear zone around the colonies and 
purified by several streaking . The most promising bacterial isolate 
was used for further dye decolorizing studies. The isolate P. putida  
strain MR1  used in the present study is a Gram positive rod. 
Identification of isolate as P. putida  strain MR1  was done by 16S r -
RNA sequencing at M icrobial Type Culture Collection and Gene 
Bank (MTCC), Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTECH), 
Chandigarh  and deposited in Genbank with accession number 
MTCC 10,014. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) was 
also performed. The phylogenetic tree wa s constructed by 
neighbour -joining method.  
Growth of pure culture of Pseudomonas  was maintained on the 
mineral base medium with composition  of:  mineral base 200 ml/L; 
yeast extract 2.0 g/L; 100 mg/L of methyl red dye; trace element 
solution an d thiamine HCl solution (300 µg/ 100 ml) and pH 7.0. 
Optimum temperature for growth was 3 7°C. The compo sition of 
final medium include:  mineral base 200 ml/L; yeast extract 2.0 g/L 
and 100 mg/L of methyl  red dye. T he final volume was adjusted to 
1000 ml with distilled water. The pH of the medium was kept at 7.0. 
The  medium   was  autoclaved    at   121°C   for   20 min    and   then   
 
 
 
supplemented with 100 ml/L of previously autoclaved trace element 
solution having the composition (g/L): CoCl 2 0.2; H 3BO 3 0.3; 
ZnSO 4.7H 2O 0.1; MnCl 2.4H 2O 0.03; Na 2MoO 4.H2O 0.03; 
NiCl 2.6H 2O 0.02; CuCl 2.2H 2O 0.01 and 100 ml/L of autoclaved and 
filtered thiamine HCl solution (300 µg/100 ml).  
 
 
Chemicals  
 
All chemicals used were of analytical grade. The methyl red was 
obtained from Hi Media,  India.  
 
 
Decolorization procedure  
 
The flasks containing mineral base medium (100 mL each) and 
methyl red (10 mg) were inoculated using loopful of isolate  P. 
putida  strain MR1 . The uninoculated flask containing mineral base 
medium (100  mL) and methyl red (10mg) was taken as control. 
These flasks were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The decolorization 
was determined by measuring the difference between optical 
density of  control and i noculated flasks at 473 nm. The  
decolorization (%) was calculated as:  
 
Decolor ization  (%) = (Absorbance of control – observed  
absorbance) / absorbance of control × 100.  
 
The dye decolorization efficiency of the isolate P. putida  strain MR1 
was also tested against other various dyes which included 
malachite green  and some of the text ile dyes  like Red RH, Brown 
GR, Yellow FG , etc. 
 
 
Study of physicochemical parameters  
 
The isolated microbia l strain P. putida  MR1 was  cultivated in liquid 
media under different physiological conditions to study the growth 
kinetics and also the decolorizat ion process. These parameters 
included temperature, pH, dye concentration, addition of various 
carbon sources (sucrose, glucose, lactose, sodium acetate and 
starch) in the media , etc. The spectrophotometric analysis was 
carried out to study the effect of v arious parameters on the growth 
and the decolorizing ability of the isolate. The mineral base medium 
without the dye was used as a blank.  
 
 
Effect of temperature  
 
The effect of different incubation temperatures on growth and  
decolorization process was st udied by keeping inoculated flasks, at 
different temperatures in the range of 30 to 40 °C together   with  the  
control (0.1  g/L dye) for  24  h incubation.  
 
 
Effect of pH  
 
The effect of medium pH on the growth and decolorization 
efficiency of the isolate wa s investigated in the pH range of 6.5 to 
7.5. 
 
  
Effect of dye concentr ation  
 
To find out the most appropriate concentration of dye that could be 
decolorized in a shorter duration. The concentration of the dyes  
used was 50, 100 and 200 mg/L,  respectively.   These  flasks  were

then incubated at 3 7°C.  
 
 
Effect of various ca rbon sources  
 
The decolorization efficiency of the isolate using me thyl red (100 
mg L-1) was also evaluated in the presence of different carbon 
sources like glucose, lactose, starch, sodium acetate and sucrose 
in the mineral base medium at a concentration of 1g/L keeping all 
other parameters constant.  
 
 
Growth kinetics  
 
The isolate was  also characterized in term s of their growth profile at 
optimal conditions in which the various parameters such as the 
increase in the cell biomass and the exact time of decolorization , 
etc, was monitore d. 
 
 
RESULTS  
 
Isolation and identificat ion 
 
Soil and sludge samples collected from contaminated 
sites around various dye industries in Sanganer, Jaipur 
were used for isolat ion of dye decolorizing culture  in 
mineral base medium at pH 7.0 . The isolate was  Gram 
negative rod shaped bacteria. The pa rtial nucleotide base 
sequencing (1529 base pairs) of 16S rRNA of isolate was 
done at Institute of Microbial T echnology (IMTECH), 
Chandigarh. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) 
search ( Table  3) for sequence homology at GenBank 
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ) was also performed which 
showed that the bacteria had  100% homology with P. 
putida strain BASUP87 16S ribosomal RNA gene partial 
sequence , Pseudomonas monteilii strain SB3091 16S 
ribosomal RNA sequence, Pseudomonas sp. J4(2008) 
16S ribosomal RNA sequence and Pseudomonas sp. 
BJQ-D4 16S ribosomal RNA, P. putida strain LH -R1 16S 
ribosomal RNA gene and 99% identity with 
Pseudomonas sp. HB01 gene for 16S ribosomal gene 
partial sequence.  
A phylogenetic tree (Fig ure 1) suggests that the isolate 
shows very near ev olutionary relationship with Pseudomonas oryzihabitans IAM 1568T (D84004). Thus , 
the isolate was identified as P. putida strain MR1 and  
deposited at Microbial Type Culture Collection  and Gene 
Bank ( MTCC ), IMTECH, Chandigarh, with accession 
number MTCC 10,0 14. 
 
 
Decolorization performance  
 
The isolate P. putida  strain MR1 could decolorize the dye 
methyl red as well as some other dyes to an appreciable 
extent as shown in Table 1. The effect of various 
physicochemical parameters  like pH, temperature, 
carbon so urce on decolorization of dye methyl red by the 
isolate was studied in mineral base medium with 100  mg/l 
methyl  red. 
 
 
Effect of temperature  
 
The  incubation  temperature  affected  the  growth  and  
activity  of  the  P. putida  strain MR1.  Based on the 
results of Figure 2, the maximum decolorization was 
obtained when the isolate was incubated at 34 °C 
followed by 37 °C. A very low efficiency of decolorization 
was obtained under lower and higher temperature of 
incubation . 
 
 
Effect of pH  
 
It was observed that maximum growth and maximum 
decolorization was achieved at pH 7.0. Even below and 
above the neutral pH , the isolate  was able to grow and 
decolorize  the methyl red  (Figure 3). 
 
 
Effect of various methyl red concentrations  
 
The rate and extent of decolorizati on were affected by 
increasing concentrations of dye ranging from 50 to 200 
mg/L. The  spectrophotometric  analysis   (scanned   in   a

Effect of various carbon sou rces 
 
While trying to enhance decolorization performance of 
methyl red, extra carbon sources were added  in the 
medium. The spectropho tometric analysis revealed that 
the percentage decolorization was maximum (95.39%) 
when no extra carbon source was added in  the medium  
and 94.99 and 92% decolorization was seen with glucose 
and sucrose , respectively , while less decolorization was 
seen with starch (88%) and  lactose (86%) . 
 
 
Growth profile of isolate  
 
It was observed that with increase in incubation time , the 
decolorization efficiency of the isolate  increased and the 
dye methyl red was completely decoloriz ed at 24 h of 
incubation    (Table  2)   while    the    cell    biomass     also increased up to 1 2 h and then decreased  (Figure 4). 
 
 
DISCUSSION  
 
The isolate P. putida  strain MR1 could decolorize the dye 
methyl red (no peak) and some other dyes like Yellow FG  
(4.27%), Red RH  (16.69%), Ponceau S  (3.19%) and 
Brown GR  (7.28%). The observed variation in percent 
decolorization of different dyes by the isolate was 
attributed to the difference in structure and complexity of 
each dye (Zimmermann et al., 1982; Sani and Banerjee, 
1999 ; Khehra et al., 2004).  
Different physicochemical parameters like temperature, 
pH, dye concentration and carbon source influence 
decolorization  of textile dyes by the isolate . In our present 
investigation, the optimum pH and temperature required 
for the efficient decolorization   of  dye  methyl red   by  the

isolate P. putida  strain MR1 in the liquid culture was 7.0 
and 34 °C, respectively.  
Normally , dye decolorizing bacteria have a narrow pH 
range (Che n et al., 2003 ; Moosvi et al., 2005). Presently , 
it was found that maximum growth of isolate and 
maximum decolorization (94.63%) was achieved at pH 
7.0. This is in agreement with the studies previously  
conducted on degradation of methyl red by Adedayo et 
al. (2004 ) and Verma and Ma damwar  (2005 ).  
Increase in temperature proved to hav e a positive 
effect on the  growth  of the isolate  and methyl red 
decolorization, which was maximum (0.828 and 91% , 
respectively) at 34 °C. These observations could be 
attributed t o the increase in enzyme activity and growth 
increase with the temperature (Asad et al., 2006). 
However, further temperature increase proved to be quite 
limiting for the growth and related decolorization o f 
methyl red by the isolate .  
The isolate decoloriz ed methyl red maximally  (99.65%)  
at dye concentration of 100  mg/l. Further increase in dye 
concentration resulted in decrease in the percentage of 
decolorization and cell growth. This might be due to 
toxicity of dye through the inhibition of metabolic acti vities 
(Asad et al. , 2006).  
 
 
Conclusion  
 
The dye methyl red was completely decolorized by a 
bacterium isolated from the soil samples collected from 
textile dyeing industrial region of Sanganer, Jaipur , 
Rajasthan.  The isolate was identified as P. putida  strain 
MR1 by MTCC, IMTECH, Chandigarh. The isolate 
decolorized dye methyl red within 24  h of incubation. 
Maximum decolorization was achieved at temperature 
34°C and pH 7.  The partial gene sequence  of 16S rRNA, 
BLAST search and phylogenetic tree of the isola te were 
also made.
