COMMERCIAL FISHES FROM THE 
MEDITERRANEAN SEA AND THE RED SEA 
by 
A. Herzberg and Rachel Pasteur 
ABSTRACT 
Data are needed on the proximate composition of tropical and semitropical fishes. 
This paper reports, on a year-round basis, the proportio ns of protein, oil, ash, and water 
in 10 commercial species of fishes from the Eastern Mediterranean Sea and the Southern 
Red Sea. All species were high in protein. The demersal fishes were low in oil, where­
as the pelagic fishes were relatively high. Large changes in the concentration of oil ob­
served in the pelagic fishes were probably related to the spawning cycle.

first part presents data on physical charac­
teristics (that is, on the length and weight of the fishes analyzed ) and on proximate com­
position. The second part examines the broad 
relations among the variables studied. 
I. PHYSICAL DATA AND PROXIM ATE COMPOSITION 
Most fishes from the Mediterranean Sea 
(Figure 1) were sampled at the dock immedi­
ately after they were brought into harbor or

Figure I.-Fishing areas of the investigated species. 
were sampled on the trawler (Figure 2) imme­
diately after the net was hoisted aboard (Fig­
ure 3) and unloaded. Some samples of fish, 
however, were bought at the market. These 
included Sardinella aW'ita, Scornbe?' japonic'Us 
(Pacific mackerel), and E'Uthynn'Us allettemt'Us 
(little tunny) all of which were caught by 
purse seines in the Eastern Mediterranean and 
were bought on the day they were captured . 
Fishes from the Red Sea were given to us 
by the fishing company at the wholesale market in Haifa, immediately after they arrived by 
overland transport from Eilat. Owing to this 
method of handling, the fishes from the Red Sea 
were kept for about 10 days on ice before they 
arrived at the laboratory. 
A. PHYSICAL DATA 
In this section, we specify the fishes that 
were sampled and the measurements that were 
made on them. 
1. Fishes Sampled 
The fishes analyzed wer~ taken once a 
month, for as long as they were available, from 
commerci al catches, so they include only the 
abundant and commercially important species. 
During peak seasons, SardineUa a'Urita, Scorn­
beT japonic'U s, and Euthynnus alletteratus were 
sampled several times a month. They were 
caught by trawls and purse seines in the East­
ern Mediterranean. 
The other fishes analyzed were caught 
mostly by trawls and purse seines. M'Ull'Us 
bal'batus (red mullet; Figure 4), Upeneus 
rnol'Uccensis (golden banded goatfish; Figure 
5), Sc~w'ida undosq'Uarni s (Red Sea lizardfish; 
Figure 6), and SphYl'Clena Ch1'ysotaenia (ob­
t'Usatc~ ) (blunt jaw barracuda; sea pike; Fig­
ure 7) were caught in the Eastern Mediter­
ranean trawl fishery; Sa)'dinella aW'ita, Scorn­
be?' (Pne'Urnato1Jhor'Us) japonic'Us, Euthynn'Us 
aUettendus, and S1Jhyraena chrysotaenia were 
caught in the purse seine fishery there. Saw'ida 
t'Urnbil (Red Sea lizardfish), Sphymena jello 
(Red Sea barracuda), Nernipterus japonicus 
(threadfin bream), and Upeneus rnol'Uccensis 
were caught by trawls in the Southern Red Sea.

different countries for different p ci f fish, 
a list of fi h names (Table 1) add d h reo 
All fish caught by trawl w re ic d on board 
and kept on ice until th y arrived at th lab­
oratory. Fish caught by pur e ein s w r 
iced when they arrived at the harbor, w l' 
kept on ice, and were brought to th la ora­
tory on the day after th y w re caught. 
Analysi of all sample wa carri d out 
either immediately after th y an'iv d at the 
laboratory 01' after they had b n tor d for 
1 to 2 days in polyethylene bags at -0 to -100 
C. (any changes in chemical composition dur­
ing transport or storage were not mall r d). 
2. Measureme nts Made 
The total length and the tandard length 
(the straight-line distance from th mo t an­
terior part of the head back' 'ard to the end 
of the "ertebral column) of ach fi h were gen­
erally mea ured to the neare t O. -c ntimeter. 
The total '\'eight was determined generally to 
the nearest 0.1 gram. Yery big fi h, e pecially 
EuthYIIIIllS. were weigh d to the nearest gram 
or ;) grams. Length measurements of e\'eral p ci s, I cially f mall fish w re some-

48 Nitrogen (crude protein), oil, and ash were 
determined according to the official methods of 
the Association , but with the following modifi­
cations: 
1. Isopropanol was substituted for ethanol 
in the determination of oil. 
2. Porcelain crucibles were used instead 
of platinum ones. The ash was not 
moistened, and the sample was not re­
ashed (Thompson, 1966). 
3. Selenium powder was used as the cat­
alyst in the determination of nitrogen 
(Thompson, 1966). 
We analyzed the samples in duplicate. 
When, however, the results were questionable, 
we analyzed them in triplicate . 
2. Results 
Tables 2 to 12 and Figures 8 to 17 give 
the data on the concentr ation of protein, fat, 
ash, and water in the fishes. 
o. Protein. -The concen tra tion of crude 
protein ranged from about 17 to 24 percent, 
so all species were classed in the high-protein 
group (15 to 20 percent) or the very-high­
protein group (20 percent and over) specified 
in Stansby's system of classification (1962). 
Even the high-oi! group (over 15 percent oil) 
always contained more than 15 percent protein 
and ometimes more than 20 percent. This 
group is not included in Stansby's sy tern. The 
member of this high-oil, high-protein group 
are Euthynnus alletteratus, Sa1'dinella aurita, 
and Scmnb l' japonicus. Euthynnus all tter­
atus had particularly high-protein alues 
(Tables 2 to 4). 
b. Oil. -mall-to-very-large change in oil 
concentrati nand imultaneou change in dry 
matter were ob er ed. V. e believe that the e

A discu sion of oil cont nt can harlly b

Low oil and high protein (15 to:2 I rc nt 
were found in both the Saw'ida I CI 
nlldOS(lllallli~ and S. fllll/bil) and in X( mipt( nl • 
japollicllS and Sphyra Ila jdlu. The R d 
species were generally low l' in concentrati n 
of oil than were their Iediterran an counter­
parts. Scmipterlls japoniclls particularly \Va 
very lean (Table 11), Saw'ida tnmbil contain d 
less oil than did . llndosqllamis, which inhabits 
both seas (Tables and 9); phyl'Cl na j lio 
was much leaner than \Va S. ehry ota Ilia 
(Tables 4 and 9). Upelleus moluce nsis from 
the Red Sea was never a fat a the same A h

oslavtseva's (1966) data on the composition 
of N emipterus iaponieus , Upeneus tl'CLgula, 
U. vitatus, Saw'ida gl'CLcilis, and many other 
species from the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden 
tend to ubstantiate our general impres ion 
that lean A h (containing 0.25 to 3.2 percent 
oil with a high protein content of 19 to 23 
percent) are common in the Red Sea area.

iods of the year they are extremely lean. They 
contained up to 10 percent and 7 percent, 
respectively, of a bright orange oil that be­
comes colorless when exposed to unlight. 
The three pelagic species--Euthynnus al­
letteratus, Scomber japonicus, and Sardinella 
aurita--varied widely in concentr ation of oil. 
They furnish a good example of the rule that 
52 i olat d analy e do not give a true pic ure 
ither of compo ition or of the complex chang 
that may affect compo ition. 
c. Ash.-\\ e found orne ariation in the 
concentration of a h, \ hich ranged from about 
1.5 to 2.5 percent in mo t pecie but we could

Figure lB.-The possible relation between aver­
age and individual at content in 
the catches of Sardinella aU?-ita 
in the Eastern Mediterranean. II. RELATION BETWEEN PHYSICA L FACTORS AND OIL 
CONCENTRATION 
Discussed very brieflly here is the effect 
of the environment on the concentration of oil 
in the fishes and then considered in greater 
detail is the effect of the biological develop­
ment of the fishes on the concentrati on of oil 
in them. 
A. ENVIRONMENT 
The sampling area along Israel's Mediter­
ranean Coast is so small that any difference s 
in the chemical composition of the fish caught 
there can hardly be attributed to a marked 
variation in environment al factors. Although 
fishes from the Red Sea were generally leaner 
than were similar ones from the Mediterranean 
Sea, the number of samples taken for this 
study was too small to lead to any final con­
clusion about the relation between oil concen­
tration and habitat. 
B. BIOLOGICA L DEVELOPMENT 
The age of a fish and the season of the 
year almost certainly influence the physiolog­
ical cycle and, together with the food supply, 
cause a wide fluctuation in concentration of oil. 
In this secti0n we consider the effect on 
the concentration of oil in the fishes of (1) 
the spawning cycle and (2) the condition 
factor, which will be defined shortly. 
1. Spawning Cycle 
We consider the relation between the con­
centration of oil and the spawning cycle for 
the following species: (a) tunny and barra­
cuda, (b) mackerel, and (c) sardine. 
a. Tunny and barracuda.-For Euthynnus 
allette?"C~tus at least, an inverse relation between 
RGS' and concentration of oil can be postu­
lated as shown in Figure 19. This species 
spawns from May until August, depending on 
. [(gonad weight) (100)] 
1 RGS (rapport gonosomatlque) = [(body weight) ] 
[Bougis (1952) as cited by Postel (1955)]. the age of the fish. As the gonads develop, 
the concentration of oil apparently decreases. 
In June, a relatively high oil concentr ation was 
found both in this species and in Sphyraena 
chrysotaenia. (Possibly the fish were exam­
ined at the same time or after they had 
spawned.) The fattening of Euthynnus allet­
teTatus, which reaches a maximum in Decem­
ber, coincides with the decrease in the size of 
Weight the gonads. The condition factor (F = L h) engt 
increases twice--once during June and July, 
mostly through gonadal developm ent, and once 
during December, mostly through fattening. 
The relation of the spawning cycle and 
fat content of clupeids has been reviewed by 
Blaxter and Holliday (1963). In herring as 
well as in Sardina pilchaTdus, the concentra­
tion of fat decreases during spawning. This 
decrease is due, at least partly, to a cessation 
of feeding. 
b. Mackerel. - A similar, although fainter, 
picture shows up for Scomber iaponicus, which 
spawns in this area during early summer 
(Ben-Tuvia, 1957a). These small mackerels 
appear during the summer and presumably 
gain weight and accumulate oil until they at­
tain marketab~e size in the fall. The increase 
in size, combined with the accumulation of oil, 
causes a gain in total dry weight per fish. The 
gain in 1965 averaged about 0.69 grams per 
80

61 day from August to November and about 0.57 
grams per day for the same period in 1966-­
that is, between 2 and 3 grams total weight 
per day--quite an accomplishment for a fish 
of about 20 to 30 grams total weight in August. 
c. Sardine.-Ben-Tuvia (1963b) reports 
that the spa'vVning of SaTdinella aurita contin­
ues throughout most of the summer. Spawn­
ing thus may be a partial explanation both for 
their extreme leanness during this period and 
for the wide divergences in the concentration 
of oil in different specimens within the same 
catch. These differences could also indicate 
that sardines have a fast metabolic rate, for 
they are capable of becoming fat within a very 
short time. The picture was somewhat ob­
scm'ed, however , because several year classes 
with possibly different seasonal cycles were 
taken from the same catch. One group may 
have been gaining fat while another was be­
coming leaner. This seeming paradox has 
been cle~c I'ibed by Clark (1928) for Sa/'dinops 
('aerulea (sal'dine) in the Pacific. The proba­
bility that different stocks were contributing 
to the catch (Ben-Tuvia, 1957b) adds further 
complexity to the picture. 
2. Condition Factor 
We could establish no relation between the 
concentration of oil and the condition factor 
for Sa/'dillclla aurita 01' Scomber .ia}Jol1icus. 
Nor could we find a l'elation between age and 
concentration of oil, except. perhaps in the 
summer catches of SC//'dillclla au/'ita (July to 
August 1966). These small fish, which were 
spa\med earlier in 1966. were fatter than the 
larger fish, ,,'hich were in the middle of their 
spawning season. In the summer of 1965, all 
fish--small and large--we re lean, and we ob­
served no differences in their proximate com­
position. 
Hel'Zberg (1967) has assumed that a loga­
rithmic relation exists between the ratio of 
total ,,'eight to standard length and the oil 
concenh'atio n of Mullus bal'batns. The data 
in the present wOI'k support this assumption. 
Fl'om this relation, we calculated the regression 
eqnation, which is 
Y = 6.973X + 0.965 
62 where Y = oil concentration in percent and 
Av.TW(g .) 
X = Log. Av.SL(cm.); N = 45. The range 
of SL (standard length) is from 9.0 to 14.2 
centimeters, the range of TW (total weight) 
is from 16.0 to 72.0 grams, and the range of 
fat concentration is from 0.8 to 8.0 percent. 
Sy.x, the mean deviation from regressio n, is 
1.507 percent oil. 
Sy, the sample standard deviation of Y, is 0.44 
to 0.50 percent for nearly the entire range 
(n = 44) of X (0.13 to 0.70). 
Sy is 1.56 to 1.59 percent. 
Thus, from the length and weight measure ­
ments, a rough estimate of oil content can be 
made. 
Figure 20 shows the relation graphically.

Norman W. Durrant and Carol Jolly 
ABSTRACT 
Both marine algae and fresh-water algae may help to solve the problem of world 
hunger. Of these two groups, the fresh-water algae show the greater promise; and of the 
fresh-water algae --blue green and green --the green algae show the greater promise. 
Accordingly, this report centers largely on green algae (Chlorella in particular) and dis­
cusses both their artificial production and nutritional value. By a suitable manipulation 
of variables, green algae containing as much as 50 percent or more protein, on a dry­
weight basis, can be manufactur ed continuously on a large scale.

67 INTRODUCTION 
Basically, efforts to solve the problem of 
world hunger have fallen into two categories -­
those aimed at controlling the growth of pop­
ulation and those aimed at increasing the pro­
duction of food. This paper is concerned with 
the latter. 
In man's attempt to increase the production 
of food, he has expanded the amount of culti­
vable land through such means as clearance of 
forests or reclamation of deserts; used exist­
ing land more intensively through multiple­
cr(\p rotation 01' fertilizatio n programs; and 
increased the yield through genetic improve­
ment of crops, use of pesticides, and mecha­
nization (Brown, 1963). Also, he has tried a 
yat'iety of methods that would accelerate the 
growth of plants, often by cu ltivation in man­
made enyironme nts, sometimes in aqueous so­
lutions without soil. At present, the latter 
method, which is known as hydroponic s, is 
generally considered to be impractical fOl' pro­
ducing food stuffs on a large scale. 
Yet anothel' approach that has received 
much attention, especially in the past two dec­
ades, is to increase the u e of aquatic l·esources . 
These may include use of the resources latent 
in the marine fishel'ies; culturing fish in a 
\\"ide l'ange of environments ranging from salt­
water estuarines to fresh-water ponds; and 
u ing plankton, the swarms of floating, small 
plant and animals that live near the ocean's 
surface (Osborn, 1953). Also suggested has been the expanded use of aquatic plants --par­
ticularly the algae. This paper is concerned 
specifically with the tremendous potential of 
algae for increasing our supply of food. 
Algae are a primitive group of plants, some 
of which have the simplest possible life cyc.le. 
They are usually classified according to the 
color of the dominant pigment --for example, 
green, blue-green, brown, or red. No matter 
the color, however, they all contain chlorophyll, 
the substance e sential to the use of solar en­
ergy for the production of organic matter. 
Green and blue-green algae, although found in 
both fresh and salt water and even in a ter­
restrial environment, are primarily fresh­
water plants and compared with the brown and 
red algae are relatively small, the smallest be­
ing microscopic. Brown algae, which include 
kelps, oarweeds, and rockweeds, grow best in 
the colder areas of the ocean and often form 
large beds. Characteristica lly, red algae fluor­
ish in the warmer areas and in relatively deep 
water; Irish moss, dulse, and laver belong to 
this latter group. 
Since brown and red algae differ consider­
ably from the gl'een and blue-green algae both 
in ize and structural complexity, and since 
their potential for artificial cultivation and 
hence for more effective use in combating world 
hunger i , we believe, less than that of green 
and blue-green algae, we \vill consider the two 
groups separately in the following discussion. 
I. BROWN AND RED ALGAE 
In the u e of any natural resource , quantity 
and availability are crucial. Accordingly, in 
our consideration of the potential of brown 
and red algae as food for man, we consider 
their supply before investigating their u e. 
A. SUPPLY 
The abundance of marine algae can be 
more ea ilyenvi ioned when one considers that 
over 70 percent of the earth's surface is cov­
er d with water. 
6 Our use of the many resources of the 
oceans, however, has been negligible. Al­
though some 17,000 species of algae (including 
green and blue-green plants) have been identi­
fied, only about 20 have been thoroughly in­
vestigated for their potential commercial util­
ization. Of the many possible colloidal extracts 
from these thousands of species, only three -­
agar, algin, and carragee nin --have gained 
any sub tantial commercial importance. Yet, 
for centuries, seaweed have been u ed in var­
ious parts of the world as human food. f

CUll n 1'1 •• a. Animal food.- Algae are used in a 
number of different countries as a food or a 
food supplement for domestic animals. For 
example, in Finland and Iceland, sheep and 
cattle are allowed to browse on the algae­
strewn shores. In Norway, Scotland, France, 
and certain other coastal counti'ie s, seaweeds 
are a supplementary feed for sheep and cattle. 
Notably in Norway, alga meals have been used 
to supplement the diets of chicks, laying hens, 
and pigs. 
b. Human food. -Algae are used as human 
food --both as a primal'y foodstuff, whel'ein 
the seaweed itself may be eaten, and as a sec­
ondary foodstuff, wherein extracts from the 
seaweed may be added to various foods. 
(1) Foodstuff. -In 1913, a writer for 
the N (' /(' Yo I'k El'en ing Post predicted: 
It is within the bounds of reasonable expecta­
tion that we shall soon see "Shredded Seaweed," 
"Flaked Fucus." "Dessicated Dulse," "Predigested 
Sargassum," "Puffed Nereocysti s," "Malto Kelp," 
"Cream of Sea Moss," and a score more substitutes 
for hot cakes and maple syrup, done up in one­
pound packages, "Guaranteed under the Pure Food 
Laws," and crammed down the throats of a long 
suffering and surfeited people (Chapman, ID52). 
The pl'edictions of the newspaper writer were 
a bit premature, yet someday algae may be 
used as a primary foodstuff throughout much 
of the world. 
Today, sea'weeds al'e used to augment food 
supplies only to a minor extent in Europe and 
North America . Perhaps the most commonly 
eaten seaweed on a worldwide basis is Po/,­
phyra. 
Some of the primary species from the 
POl'phyra genus that are commonly eaten in­
clude P. pe1,/orata (purple laver, United 
States), P. naiadum (red fringe, United 
States), P. umbilicalis (laver, England and 
Wales), P. laGiniata (slack, Scotland), P. ten­
eTa (amanori and nori, Japan), P. onoi (ono­
nori, Japan), P. okamurai (kuro-nori, Japan), 
P. kunth1'ana (luche apanodo fresco, Chile), 
P. columbina (New Zealand), and P. CCLpensis 
(South Africa). 
Another species of seaweed commonly used 
for food is Rhodym enia pcLlmata (dulse). This 
species is unusual in that, unlike most sea-
70 weeds, it is completely digestible by man. It 
has long been used as a primary foodstuff 
rather than as a source of seaweed extract. It 
is dried and commonl y eaten raw, chewed like 
gum, eaten with fish and butter, or boiled with 
milk and rye flour. In the countries of the 
Mediterranean region, dulse is used in ragouts 
and other prepared dishes. During the years 
of famine in Ireland, dulse and potatoes were 
the staple foods of the people inhabiting the 
coastal regions. Coastal inhabitants of the 
Canadian Maritime provinces eat dulse, which 
they consider to be health-giving. 
Seaweeds constitute an essential portion of 
the Japanese diet (Okazaki, 1964).' nder­
standably, more seaweed is eaten in Japan 
than in any other nation. Algae are of such 
commercial and nutritional importance to the 
Japanese that the natural or uncultivated sup­
ply is insufficient to satisfy the demand. Ac­
cordingly, they have developed large industries 
to cultivate the plants. 
POTphY 1YL or "nori," a red alga, is probably 
the most important alga u ed for food in Japan. 
This species is raised to a large extent by 
"farming." Heavy netting supported by bam­
boo poles is stretched over the surface of the 
water and seeded naturally or artificially with 
spores that grow to be marketable leafy plants. 
It is important to place the netting at the pro­
per depths within the range of tides so that 
it is covered most of the time, yet is occasionally 
exposed (4 hours per day) so that the nori 
can be harvested by farmers who move along 
the webbing in small boats and remove the 
algae from the nets by hand. The standard 
net is about 60 feet long and 4 feet wide with 
6-inch mesh openings. 
P01'phyra is used to make Japanese "maki­
zushi." This dish is prepared by wrapping 
toasted algae around a core of rice that en­
closes strips of fish or shellfish and sometimes 
vegetables. Despite an annual production of 
130,000 tons, the demand is still greater than 
the supply.

loan from the Branch of Technology, Bureau of Commerciol Fisheries, 
U.S. Departmen t of the Interior, Washingto n, D.C. 20240. Among the several species of algae used as 
food by the Japanese, the brown alga Undaria 
pinnatijida , is second in popularity to PorphYTCL. 
The overall production of UnrkL?"ia in Japan 
has increased steadily during the past 10 years, 
and the fraction of the crops produced by 
"farming" has grown to the point where, in 
1966-67 for the first time, it exceeded that ob­
tained from natural harvesting. Since 1960, 
the annual production of Undaria in Japan 
has averaged about 65,000 tons. 
Another important algal foodstuff is a 
brown oarweed df the genus Lamina?'ia. This 
seaweed is a soutce of the chemical seasoning 
monosodium glutamate , now used extensive ly 
in the United States. 
Despite the 'Widespread use and the po­
tential of algae as a human food, remarkably 
little is known about their nutritive value. 
Various scientists suggest that the roughage 
of the algae corrtpensates for the lack of per­
istalsis-inducin g foods in the rice-and-fi sh diet 
of the Asiatic peoples. Others suggest that 
the major value of algae lies in the mineral 
salts and vitamins (A, B, and C) that both 
brown and red algae contain. These salts and 
vitamins help prevent deficiency diseases. Most 
scientists agree that the high iodine content 
in seaweed contribute s to the low incidence of 
goiter in the Otlent (Chapman, 1952; Oka­
zaki, 1964'). 
Yet no definitive experiments have been 
made on the digestibility of algal protein or 
carbohydrates. Although those who conect 
and eat seaweeds are aware that the number 
and the amount of the nutrients in seaweeds 
vary not only with the particular species but 
also with the locality and the season of col­
lection, the extent of the variation has not been 
systematically analyzed. Almost nothing is 
known about the vitamin D, E, and K contents 
of algae under various condition of growth. 
Although experiments with both livestock and 
humans indicate that digestibility improves 
after the subject has become adapted to the diet 
of algae, the experiments have all been short 
term; thus the conditioning that might have 
, See footnote 1. altered the results has been re trict d. In 
most of the experiments with .. re iden , 
people who are not accu tomed to eatin<T ea­
weeds have been u ed. This choice of ubj cts 
probably explains why tests that involve both 
Japanese and Americans produce uch diver e 
results. Only the tests on agar-agar have pro­
duced any sub tantial proof that algae have 
a nutritive value for human. This ub tance 
is low in calories and digestible carbohydrates, 
starch, and fat, yet it is valuable as a laxative 
and as a source of protein. 
(2) Food additive . -Having consid­
ered the use of seaweeds directly as a food, 
let us now briefly consider their indirect use. 
Seaweeds are noted primarily for their yield 
of three commercially important colloidal sub­
stances --algin, carrageenin and agar-agar -­
that are widely used in the processing of food. 
Algin, the generic designation of the deriv­
atives of alginic acid, is used as a stabilizer 
in ice cream, cheeses, and bakery goods. Car­
rageenin, the extract of Irish moss (Chondru s 
cl'ispus and Giga?,tirw stellata), is also u ed 
for stabilizing foodstuffs, as well as for thick­
ening and gelling; it is u ed widely in com­
mercially proce sed chocolate milk, pie filling, 
and milk puddings. Agar-agar (commonly 
called agar) is a product of certain ~pecies of 
red algae grown primarily in Japan; an in­
dustry for the extraction of this substance 
from algae collected in various parts of the 
world ha also been established on the west 
coast of the United States. Agar-agar is most 
commonly used as a solidifying agent for cul­
ture media; however, because of its gelling 
propertie , it ha become increasingly impor­
tant as a packing agent and as a thickener. 
In both Europe and orth America, agar-agar 
is used in canning fish, fowl, and meat, since 
the jellylike coating it provides prevents break­
age and other physical damage to the meat. 
It has been used also in the manufacture of 
jellies, sauces, chee es, and pastries. Japan 
exports large quantities of agar-agar to other 
Asiatic countries, where poorer people eat it 
plain (Chapman, 1952; Okazaki, 1964 ). 
3 See footnote 1. 
71 II. BLUE-GREEN AND GREEN ALGAE 
In contrast with the brown and red algae, 
blue-green and green algae pl'esent a totally 
different spectrum of possibilities and problems 
as potential food sources, These plants are 
found mainly in fresh-water ponds, The food 
value of blue-green algae now lies primarily 
in their use in the cultivation of l'ice field ; 
their potential as a foodstuff is virtually unex­
plored, Gl'een algae, on the other hand, al'e 
known to have the potential for direct use as 
food, Since 1947, when Spoehr and Milner 
(1948) first Pl'oposed the possibility of using 
the unicellulm' green alga Chlo)'clla as a food­
stuff, it has been intensively studied in many 
parts of the world, 
Since little infol'l11ation exists about the 
food potential of blue-green algae, we will pass 
quickly o\'el' these algae; then we will probe 
the potentials of green algae in detail. 
A. BLUE-GRE EN ALGAE 
Blue-green algae have been kno\\'n for some 
time to be an important factor in the culti­
\'ation of rice. In the early growth stage of 
the usual \Yetland type of rice, the fields have 
to be not only flooded but also considerable 
nitrogen must be provided, Yet, rice has been 
grown in the same field year after year with­
out artificial fertilizat ion. This paradox is 
Im'gely due to the presence of blue-gree n algae 
in the floodwaters. Bacteria associated with 
the algae have the power of nitrogen fixation, 
meaning they assimilate atmosphe ric nitrogen 
forming nitrogenous compounds that are uti­
lized by algae, This symbiotic nitrogen cycle 
is completed when the algae decompose, there­
by enriching the soil with its assimulated 
nib'ogenou s compounds. Algae also play a 
role in aeration of the rice fields, because the 
oxygen produced by photosynthesis aids in the 
rice plant's metabolism, Unless algae are 
present when fields are flooded, the amount of 
oxygen available to the rice plant is reduced, 
leading to oxygen-deficient plants more suscep­
tible to disease (Chapman, 1952). 
More than half the people in the world get 
at least 60 percent of their energy from rice 
(Brown, 1963). Surprisingly, however, little 
72 research has been done on the possibilities of 
using blue-green algae more effective ly in the 
16 principa l countries where rice is the staple 
food. P rhaps cientists and economists have 
been so concern d with finding new food 
sources that they have neglected this means 
of improving an existing supply. Since most 
of the other methods for solving the problem 
of hunger will take some time to bec me ef­
fective, more work should be done on exacting 
greater yields in areas where blue-green algae 
are now used or on introducing these algae to 
rice-producing regions where they are not used. 
B. GREEN ALGAE 
When the need for greater supplie of 
food is considered, the pos ibility of large-scale 
culture of unicellula r green algae has aroused 
great enthu iasm. 
In the following di cu ion, we will consider 
the developmental investigation into problems 
of using green algae --primarily ChlO1'ella --a 
a human food and then we will look into the 
future of alga-deri\'ed food a a solution to 
the problem of world hunger. 
1. Developmental Investigations 
The developmental investigations include 
both production studies and nutrition studies. 
The process of manufacturing envisioned here 
will in all probability require a high capital 
investment. Accordingl y, the proce s must be 
soundly engineered in order to make it pay, 
and the product mu t be palatable, digestible, 
and nutritious. either the production problem 
nor the nutrition problem will be easy to solve. 
a. Production studies.- In our discussion 
of the production of algae, first we will con­
sidel' some of the unusual characteristics of 
algal growth and then we will see how these 
characteristics can be turned to use in a closed 
system. It is the possibility of growing algae 
in a closed system --even in desert countries 
--that makes green algae so potentially val­
uable. (1) Characteristics of algal growth.­
Of all the factors affecting the production of 
algae, the efficiency of their growth mechan­
ism and the ease with which their organic 
composition can be varied are most important 
to their use as a food crop. 
(a) Growth efficiency. -Man, by 
concentrating his efforts on the more produc­
tive species of plants, depends principally on 
a dozen or so plants that he uses for food. 
Moreover , he usually eats only a small part of 
each plant; thus, most of the material syn­
thesized by the few kinds of plants is not con­
sumed as human food (Manglesdorf, 1961). 
In the synthesis of organic material, plants 
use only a small proportion of the total solar 
energy falling upon them. Basically , this small 
return is due to three factors: (1) In the 
temperate zone, the growing season for plants 
is about 4 months. Only 2 or 3 weeks of this 
time is used for the manufacture of carbo­
hydrates at maximum capacity. (2) Plants 
utilize only half of the incident radiation --the 
visible wave lengths --for photosyn the is. 
Even this part of the radiation is used at an 
efficiency of less than 1 percent. (3) Carbon 
dioxide is the raw material from which or­
ganic substances are formed. Since the con­
centration of this gas} the atmosphere is only 
0.03 percent, the rate .. photosynthesis is ne­
cessarily limited (Spoehl. 1951). 
Unicellular algae, such as ChlorellCl, are 
potentially able to overcome these difficultie s. 
Their efficiency as photosynthesizers is rela­
tively high. The organic material they form 
is stored within the cell itself. The cells re­
produce by dividing, each cell producing two 
cells, which also participate in the photosyn ­
thesis. Since the cells reproduce about every 
12 hours, they can increase, under optimal 
conditions, their population about 200 times in 
4 days. The plants' nutritive requil'ements 
are slight: water, in which they are suspend­
ed; carbon dioxide and other nutrients, which 
are dissolved in the water; and light, for pho­
tosynthesis . By ensuring a continuous supply 
of the necessary raw materials, one can harvest 
the plants at the rate at which they increase. 
Continuous cultivation , then, promises a high-yield crop and permits the most efficient u e 
of land, sunlight, and manpower (Spoehr, 
1951) . 
(b) Composition l'Cl?·iability. -The 
characteristic that makes Chlo?"elia even more 
promisin g is its organic composition, which 
can be altered at will. Spoehr (1951) and Mil­
ner (1955) found that changes in environment­
al conditions caused wide variations in the 
plant's protein, carbohydrate, and lipid con­
tents. By keeping the fixed nitrogen concen­
tration above a certain minimum value, they 
produced Chlo}'ella with a protein content of 
more than 50 percent. When the level of 
nitrogen was dropped below this critical value, 
reproduction stopped, and lipid up to 85 per­
cent of dry weight was synthesized. Cal'bo­
hydl'ate content, too, can be made to vary, by 
from 6 to 39 percent (Cook, 1950; Bl'ittain, 
1952). 
The fact that high-protein Chlorella grows 
exceedingly makes it especially advantageous 
as an economical source of protein. Conserva­
tive estimates indicate that an acre of Chlorella 
can be made to yield 20 tons of dry protein 
and 2 tons of fat annually. If the Chlorl'lla 
"-ere cultinlted in such a \Yay as to increase 
its content of fat, it would yield as much as 
6 tons of fat from a single acre every .veal'. 
When we realize that the best yield of oil per 
aCl'e per year from corn is only 11 :! tons, from 
peanuts less than Yo ton, and from soybeans 
less than Y9 ton, we begin to gmsp the revo­
lutionary possibilities of food-pl'oducing algae 
(Brittain, 1952). 
(2) Growth of algae in a closed system. 
-After Spoehr (1951) and IIilner (1955) 
made their momentous finding about the var­
iability of algae's compositi on, Carneg-ie Insti­
tution of Washington (Stanford, California) 
arranged an engineering study that the Stan­
ford Research Institute (Stanford, California) 
carried out to determine if large quantities 
of algae could be gro,,-n in a controlled system. 
Only if production can be controlled will Chio­
rella, or any other unicellular plant, ever be­
come an important source of food. The Stan­
ford scientists tried to answer such que tion 
as: (a) Is it technically possible to grow large 
73 quantities of algae? (b) If so, what produc­
tion system should be used? (c) How valuable 
is the material that is produced? (d) What 
are the optimum condition s for maximum algae 
growth? (e) What is the cost of prod ucing 
large quantities of algae? 
The answers that the Stanford scientists 
obtained were most encouraging. They found 
that mass growth in a simple, continuous sys­
tem is feasible and practica l. If the system 
is properly engineered, large-scale production 
is economical. The conditions for optimum 
growth are relatively easy to attain. The op­
timum temperat ure for growth is from 20° 
to 25° C. If the needed carbon dioxide (which 
is low in cost and readily obtained) , water, 
mineral nutrients, and fixed nitrogen in proper 
concentrations are recycled after the algae are 
harvested and fresh solution is added as neces­
sary, cost can be kept low. Agitation is ne­
cessary to prevent the cells from settling out, 
and sterile conditions must be maintained to 
avoid contamination. Under these conditions, 
Chlo1'ella could be harvested continuou sly in 
a simple, cheap, and efficient system (Cook, 
1950) . 
Since this early project at Stanford Re­
search Institute, many other scientists have 
expel'imented to determine the best methods 
of culturing Chlorella. Although they have 
reached the same basic conclusions as the 
Stanford researchers, they have found addi­
tional productivity factors. For example, they 
have discovered that yield can be increased by 
inoculating the culture medium with cells in 
the exponentia l stage of growth, Agitating 
the cells with an air blast is an efficient means 
of exposing them to equal amounts of sunlight 
and nutrients, and centrifuging is an effective 
method of hal'vesting (Geoghegan, 1951). Ex­
periments with culture tanks indicate that cyl­
inders inclined normal to the sun's rays rep­
resent the most efficient design; whereas flat 
horizonta l surfaces or vertical cylinders are 
from 30 to 40 percent less efficient (Spoehr, 
1951). Ammoniacal nitrogen and urea, al­
though the cheapest, are the most efficient 
sources of fixed nitrogen; and a concentrat ion 
of 5 percent carbon dioxide in air passed over 
the culture improves the yield markedly. 
74 In 1951, the Arthur D. Little Company, 
Cambridge, Massach usetts, operated a pilot 
plant for the Carnegie Institution of Wash­
ington to determine possible yields of algae 
and costs of production. They used a tube 
160 feet long that held 1,200 gallons of culture 
in a layer 2 to 3 inches deep. The algae ma­
terial was circulated by a centrifugal pump 
and harvested in a centrifuge. Production 
over the 3 months of operatio n averaged about 
10 grams dry product per square meter per 
day, or 16 tons per acre per year. The esti­
mated cost of production was from 17 to 25 
cents per pound (Milner, 1955). 
All these findings have influenced the de­
sign of a model plant for the growth of algae 
in a closed system. Before we consider the 
theoretical model for the continuo us culture 
of algae, however, we need to consider the 
factors that tend to restrict their yield. 
(a) Yield-restricting factors.-Dur­
ing pilot-plant studies, a number of factors 
inimical to the optimum growth of algae were 
detected. For example, several workers found 
that sunlight reaches intensities too high to be 
fully utilized by Chlorella. Milner (1955) 
states that: 
In the low ranges of light intensity, the algae 
can convert nearly 25 percent of the light energy 
into chemica l energy stored as plant material. The 
amount of growth is proportional to the amount 
of light. At medium intensities, the growth of 
the algae reaches its highest value, but the effi­
ciency of energy conversion decreases (to 15 per­
cent). Beyond the light-saturation point, the effi­
ciency in use of light goes down as the light be­
comes brighter. At the very high intensities, the 
algae can use only a small fraction (2 to 3 percent) 
of the energy. Moreover, very much exposure 
to full sunlight will damage or kill the algae. 
For maximum efficiency in natural sunlight, 
the culture must be agitated so that different 
cells will be exposed to the most intense light 
in turn. Controlled, artificial light can be 
used, of course, but the use of such light is 
economically impractical (Wassink , Kok, and 
Van Oorschot, 1953). 
Open-pond culture, one of the simplest of 
production methods, does not appear to be 
practical in terms of yield. Such a method 
would preclude both the use of high concen-trations of carbon dioxide and any chance of 
operating under sterile conditions . Also, with­
out costly equipment, the suspension could not 
be stirred adequately . As a consequence, the 
effect of light of high intensity could not be 
counteracted. Furthermore, the difficultie s of 
periodically harvesting Chlo1'ellcL growing in an 
open pond would probably make the method 
impractical (Burlew, 1953).

75 let, the operator can keep the population den­
sity at an optimal level. For proper agitation, 
he recycles enough culture to create a tt1l'bulent 
rather than a streamlined flow. The necessary 
nutrient s, including carbon dioxide in the form 
of cal'bonates and bical'bonates, are introduced 
with the fresh medium; air and additiona l 
carbon dioxide are circulated throughout the 
culture. In the processing plant, the cells are 
separated from the medium by flotation. Waste 
combustion gases from the fuel used to supply 
heat for sterilization and dehydration provide 
enough carbon dioxide for optimal gl·owth. 
St pplementary ,,"ater, to which necessary nu­
trients have been added, is stel'ilized and in­
corporated into the spent medium for return 
to the culture farm (Cook. 1950). 
For a plant of this sort to be efficient, it 
would haye to produce from 50 to ?i00 tons 
of alga pel' da~". Since 2,£)00 pounds of water 
is needed for each pound of dry Chl(1/'( !la, the 
equipment for any pl'actical operation ,,"ould 
ha\'e to be large. 
Alga culture ,,"ould seem especially adapt­
able for those regions in the tropics "'here the 
soil is pOOl' but ,,"here many hours of sunlight 
and an equable temperature pre\,ail the yeal' 
around. It is adaptable to emiarid regions 
because, ince the culture medium i reused, 
the consumption of water is low. 1\101'eo\,er, 
since no soil is required, algal culture can suc­
ceed "'here ordinal'Y farming is impossible. 
b. Nutritional studies.- Using Chlorella 
pl'oduced by different pilot plants, nutl'ition ex­
perts lun"e il1\"estigated its composition and 
food \'alue. They have found that the plant, 
as ordinarily gTown, has a dry-weight compo­
sition of from 40 to 60 percent protein, from 
10 to 20 percent fat, and about 20 percent 
cal·bohydrate. By appropriately modifying 
the cultm'e conditions, the producer can vary 
the concentration of pl'otein from 7 to 85 per­
cent, that of fat fl'om 4 to 86 percent, and that 
of carbohydrate from 5 to 38 percent. Vitamin 
assays show that Chlorella contains adequate 
supplies of vitamins B, C, and D and abundant 
supplies of vitamins A and K. Comparison of 
its vitamin content with the minimum daily 
requirements of man indicates that one-fourth 
of a pound of dried Chlo1'ella per day would 
76 satisfy most if not all of a man's vitamin 
requirements (McDowell and Leveille, 1963). 
In our further discussion of the nutritional 
value of algae, we will review work that has 
been done on the protein quality and digestibil ­
ity of Chlorella, and then we will show how 
the results have been tested on men and an­
imals fed alga-containing diets. 
(1) Metabolic properties of algae.-It 
is not sufficient merely to produce protein­
containing foods. The protein must be of a 
quality that is adequate to the needs of the 
protein-requiring body, and the food in which 
it occurs must be digestible by the body. 
(a) Nut'ritil'e compounds. -Since 
the greatest need of people now suffering from 
malnutrition is for more protein, farmers will 
undoubtedly attempt to produce plants with 
the highest possible protein content. The pro­
tein content of high-protein Chiorella is com­
parable with that of white flour, corn gluten, 
or peanut meal. 
But a high content of protein alone is not 
sufficient to ensure a nutritiou s food; it must 
also contain a suitable balance of the e sential 
amino acids. The Arthur D. Little Company 
calculated an essential amino acid index for 
the algal product grown in the company's pilot 
plant and reached a figure of 62. In the index, 
,,"hole egg protein is given a value of 100. The 
values of most animal protein range between 
80 and 90; those of cereal proteins generally 
range between 60 and 70 (Fisher and Burlew, 
1953). 
One of the major amino acids deficient in 
Chlorella is methionine. This deficiency is also 
characteristic of other vegetable-protein foods 
and i the cause of their relatively low index. 
Fortunately, synthetic methionine made from 
nonagricultural products is readily and eco­
nomically available. Apparently, the method 
of preparing ChloTella largely determines 
which amino acids are available for digestion. 
Thus, variations in the methods of preparat ion 
may account for the conflicting values that 
have been reported for the amino acid avail­
ability in Chlorella-derived products (Krauss, 
1962) . The experimenta l work on algal carbohy­
drates and lipids has not been as extensive 
as that on proteins. The carbohydrates in 
ChloTella are chiefly vegetable gums, especially 
pentosans (the hydrolyzed form of pentose 
sugars). Starches also constitute a sizable 
part of the carbohydrate content (McDo'well 
and Leveille, 1963). Algal lipids are highly 
unsaturated, but aside from this fact, little is 
known about them. 
(b) Nondigestible elements. -Al­
though unicellular algae contain little or no 
cellulose (the indigestible part of higher 
plants), they do have tough cell walls, which 
are resistant to mechanical, chemical, or ther­
mal attacks. Since this part of the cell passes 
through the human digestive tract without 
contributing to the nutritional effect, much 
work has been done on means of processing 
that will break down the cell walls and thus 
increase the cells' digestibility. Shefner and 
his colleagues have found potentially useful 
mixtures of wall-degrading enzymes in ani­
mals, such as the snail, which regularly eat al­
gae (McDowell and Leveille, 1963). Much 
more experimental work will be neceSSal·y be­
fore such enzymes can be applied to alga prod­
ucts destined for human consumption. 
(2) Feeding studies. -The nutritive 
properties that have been identified in the lab­
oratory have also been observed in practical 
diets fed to both animals and people. 
(a) Animal-feeding studie . -The 
results of experiments in which green algae 
wel·e fed to animals have been highly ambig­
uous, partly because of poor techniques, but 
even more because the nutl"itive value of the 
plants depends so much on the method of 
growth and processing. 
An extensive experiment ,vas pel·fol·med 
by Henry (Geoghegan, 1951 and 1953), who 
found that 17 percent freeze-dried Chlorella 
compared favorably with dried brewel·'s yeast 
and with peanut meal in promotin g weight 
gain in rats. Geoghegan (1951 and 1953), on 
the other hand, found that it was less efficient 
than dried skim milk. Fink and Hel·old (Mc­
Dowell and Leveille, 1963) reported that the 
protein of dried Sccnedes?17,us (another uni-cellar green algae) was equal, or ,lightly 
superior, to skim milk or egg protein, and-mark­
edly superior to the vegetable protein in spin­
ach and alfalfa in stimulating growth in rats. 
The Aerospace Medical Research Team of the 
U.S. Air Force found that ordinary rations 
kept in stock could consist of as much as 42 
percent dried Chlorella and still increase 
growth when fed to weanling rats (McDowell 
and Leveille, 1963). 
Feeding tests with rats conducted by Haya­
mi and Shino (Tamiya,1959) of the National 
Institute of Nutl"ition, Tokyo, Japan, showed 
that both the digestibility and the nutritive 
value of ChlorellcL cells varied widely accOl·ding 
to the method of processing of algal material. 
The materials dried at high temperatures (100° 
C. without alcohol treatment) gave a digesti­
bility as low as 47 to 57 percent, and the gain 
in weight OCCUlTing during 100 days feeding 
was only 66 percent of that of the control an­
imals fed on a milk diet. The re ults were 
quite different when the l·ats were fed the 
algal materials that were dried at lower tem­
pel'atures (lower than 40° C.). In this case, 
the digestibility was 75 percent or more. Com­
parable figm·es for the digestibility were also 
found ,,·ith the algal material that had been 
partially decolorized by an alcohol L·eatment . 
Nakamura (Tamiya, 1959) of the Utsuno­
miya University, Ut unomiya, Tochigi-ken , 
Japan, has found that the diet containing 10 
percent decolorized algae (in addition to wheat 
flour used as the main source of cm·bohrdrate) 
was an excellent feed fOl· rats. The weight 
gain attained dming a 120-day experiment was 
more than 50 percent higher than that obtained 
with the control milk diet. The gain seems 
to val"y ,,·ith the type of animal used in the 
feeding studies. FOl· example, in chick-feeding 
tests pel·formed by Nakamura, the addition of 
such algal matel·ials to either the assorted chick 
diet or wheat was found to giYe no fayorable 
growth-promoting effect; howeyer, when fed 
to adult hens, tJ-Le addition of the algal material 
to the assorted chick diet distinctly inc rea ed 
the number of eggs laid by the hens. 
Part of the diversity in results from these 
expel·iments may be due to the different amino 
acid content of the algae used. In a study on 
77 weanling rats that were fed 18 percent of 
Chlorella as a ource of protein, significant im­
provement in weight gain and feed efficiency 
was observed after the diet was upplemented 
with methionine and histidine (McDowe ll and 
Leveille, 1963). Results of another study, done 
in Japan, indicated that the addition of methi­
onine alone doubled the weight gain in rats fed 
dried algae as the only source of protein (Mc­
Dowell and Leveille, 1963). In yet another 
experiment, the addition of lysine and thre­
onine was found to be the critical factor in 
the gTowth of rats fed on a basal diet of white 
bread (Hundley and lng, 1956). Clearly, fur­
ther \\'ork on the protein content and nutri· 
tional effects of alga diets will be needed before 
these discl'epancies can be resolved. 
(b) Hum((n-feeding studies.-Only 
a small number of studies ha\'e been reported 
on the use of microscopic algae as human food. 
In Japan, \\"here the consumption of aquatic al­
gae is no noYelty, dried pO"'dered Chiorella has 
been descdbed as tasting like dried seaweed 
or powdel'ed green tea. N oodles prepared 
from a mixture containing 2 percent ChloTella 
and either buckwheat or \\'heat flour were pro­
nounced acceptable. The powdered ChlO?'ella 
has also )::een used in palatable bread, soup, 
and ice cream. In its hydrolyzed form, it is a 
pronllsmg ubstitute for soy sauce (Fisher 
and Burlew, 1953). 
An experiment in the mid-1940's tested the 
nutritional yalue of a mixture of fresh-water 
microorganisms at the Cabo Blanco Leprosar­
ium, l\Iaiquetia, D.F., Venezuela. The mixture 
contained se\'eral species of algae, including 
Chlorella , and various microscopic animals. 
The method of preparation was far from the 
method that an operator would use on an alga 
farm today: The mixture was grown in clay 
bO"'ls, in untreated municipal water to which 
commel'cia l fertilizer was added, and was 
stilTed twice daily with a dipper. The water 
siphoned off to harvest the culture was re­
fertilized and l'etul'l1ed to the bowls. The 
product, mixed \\'ith a little water to form a 
"soup" was boiled for 20 minute, and a little 
salt was added to improve the flavor. The 
patient drank the soup willingly. It was fed 
for mOl'e than 5 years without any ill effects. 
78 In fact, the energy, weight, and general health 
of most of the patients improved markedly 
(Jorgensen and Convit, 1953), 
Tamiya (1959) of the Tokugawa Institute 
for Biological Research, Tokyo, Japan, during 
a visit to the United States, tested the palata­
bility of algal material with two different 
group of people, American and Japanese. The 
test was performed by adding a dried algal 
powder in varying concentrations to such foods 
as bread, noodles, soups, ice cream, and "miso" 
or fermented soybeans. The concIu ions of the 
tests indicated that Chlorella containing foods 
appealed more to Japanese than to American 
people. This may be attributed to the fact 
that the Japanese are accustomed to foods in­
cluding seaweed dishes which are similar to 
Chlorella not only in appearance but also in 
odor and taste. 
The procedure of treating algal cells with 
alcohol has been 2.ttempted with a view toward 
reducing the intense green color of the sample. 
The material partially decolorized by this pro­
cedure wa found to be milder in odor and taste 
and therefore , it could be added to various 
foods in higher concentrations than the non­
treated material. 
More pl'ecise experimental data have been 
assembled in only three places --at the Army 
Medical Corps in Denver; the University of 
Nebraska in Lincoln; and the National Insti­
tute in Tokyo. 
In the study by the Army Medical Corps, 
five healthy young men between the ages of 18 
and 25 consumed a mixture of ChloTella and 
Scenedesrnns in amounts increased gradually 
every few days over a period of 40 days. After 
precautionary autocIaving, the algae were add­
ed to foods that would tend to disguise the 
algae taste, such as gingerbread, chocolate cake, 
chocolate cookies, and milk. evertheless, the 
experimenters still had a problem, for the food 
to 'which the algae were added became olive­
drab in color (Krauss, 1962). The young men 
had little difficulty accepting or tolerating the 
algae up to the 100-gram (3.5-ounce) level; 
however, beyond this level, which exceeds that 
which would normally supply all necessary 
body proteins, they had difficulty in both ac-cepting and digesting the mixture. Physical 
examinations failed to show any abnormalities 
other than those associated with the gastroin­
testinal tract, but these disorders were evident. 
The investigators concluded that heat-treated 
dried algae can be tolerated as a food supple­
ment for at least short periods, but that further 
processing will be necessary if they are to be 
useful as a maj or source of food. 
In two experiments at the University of 
Nebraska, Scenedesrnus and ChloTella were 
used as the principal source of protein. In the 
first experiment, whole green algae (Scenedes­
rnus) suspended in a colloidal liquid (not de­
scribed) were fed to a group of people for 5 
days. In the second, Chlo1 'ellc~, extracted and 
decolorized with alcohol, was fed to another 
group for 20 days. Although the experiment­
ers found a slight nitrogen imbalance and high 
fecal excretion of nitrogen in both groups, the 
investigators concluded that people can eat 
these algae for up to 20 days without ill effects 
(Dam, Lee, Fry, and Fox, 1964). 
In the Japanese experiment, five healthy 
college girls were used as subjects. They were 
fed a normal diet to which 30 grams (0.85 
ounces) of algae per day was added. When 
the alga samples were dried, they were not as 
easily digested as was soybean meal. But when 
the samples were treated with alcohol, resulting 
in a partially decolorized product that was 
bland in both taste and odor, they were more 
easily digested than the soybean meal was. 
This experiment led to the conclusion that Jap­
anese have a high tolerance and acceptability 
of an algal diet (Krauss, 1962). 
Aside from this meager information , only 
two other reports of human reaction to algae 
were found. In one of the reports, a flavor 
panel at the Arthur D. Little Company ap­
praised dry and fresh-frozen Chlo1'ella. The 
conclusion was that the alga as well as the 
soups made from the alga, either fresh or froz­
en, were suggestive of vegetables and were 
generally palatable and acceptab le. Their ap­
pearance, however, was not so generally ac­
ceptable. The panel felt that the flavor of 
dried ChloTella alone is too strong to be en­
joyed in large quantities (Fisher and Burlew, 
1953). When Air Force investigators studied the possibility of using algae as a space food, 
they concluded that the taste is indeed veg­
etablelike but it has a bitter, gagging aftertaste. 
More studies are needed to find the cause of 
this unpleasant taste and to develop modifi­
cations or new methods of preparation that 
will improve the appeal of green algae to human 
consumers. 
2. Look Into the Future 
Several problems still await solution before 
large-scale production of microscopic algae can 
become a reality. To begin with, experiments 
thus far have all been limited to either a few 
species of ChloT ell(~ or one species of Scenedes­
rnus. Among the thousands of species of uni­
cellular green algae, other species may be more 
amenable to culturing, more digestible or nu­
tritious, or even more palatable than these two. 
For example, the Institute Francais de Petrole 
(1967) has been active recently in the search 
for a new type of algae whose nutrition al val­
ue was at least as good as ChloTella and whose 
culture, collection and use were simpler. Dur­
ing 1962, this French research organization 
discovered that some tribes living in isolation 
in the center of Africa had been collecting and 
eating algae since ancient times. The algae 
are collected by the women in a simple straw 
basket, transported in jars, and dried in the 
sun. These dried crusts of algae make up the 
so-called "dihe," which is cooked as a sauce 
to accompany their millet balls. 
This alga, Spi1·ulina rnax1:rna, a blue-green 
species, was first discovered growing in some 
ponds near Lake Chad in Central Africa. 
Spirulina develops optimally under high al­
kaline conditions (pH 9-10) and temperatures 
around 35° C., whereas, Chlorella requires an 
acid medium. The dried product contains 62-
68 percent protein; 18-20 percent carbohy­
drate; 2-3 percent lipids and vitamins pro A, 
B1, B2, B6, B12, and C. Institute Francais de 
Petrole is making additional studies on the 
culture and potential utilization of Spirulina 
in open air culture ponds. 
Many factors bearing upon more efficient 
cultivation of alga farms have yet to be iden­
tified. Examination of the rate of growth and 
of reproduction of the cells at high intensities 
79 of light may yet reveal some way in which the 
high efficiencies known to be possible at lower 
intensities can be maintained. Since artificial 
lighting would make operating costs imprac­
tical, it is almost certain that sunlight will be 
used as the source of light for all farms. Under 
the conditions of high intensity of light present 
throughout the year in the tropics, where a 
project such as this is sorely needed to in­
crease food supplies, new engineering tech­
niques will have to be developed to en ure max­
imum yields. 
At high density, algae apparently produce 
a metabolic product that accumulates and acts 
as [1.n autotoxin. A clearer understanding of 
the extent of this effect and of the degree to 
which it may reduce yields would be useful. 
Limited evidence indicates al 0 that contami­
nation of the culture medium by bacteria or 
microscopic animals reduces algal yield. A­
gain, the evidence is not conclusive, 0 more 
work should be done to determine if sterile 
conditions (the attainment of which, of course, 
raises the cost of production) are necessary, 
or if "clean conditions" are sufficient. Perhaps 
a selective pesticide or herbicide can be de­
veloped to kill the contaminants without af­
fecting the algae, thus avoiding the need for 
sterility. 
Most of these problems could be solved, at 
least partially, if a large pilot plant were op­
erated for a longer period than any thus far 
has been. By setting up a plant in which a 
number of variables could be controlled in dif­
ferent combinations, we could answer a host 
of unresolved questions. Such a plant would 
permit us to test a number of techniques to 
determine which would produce the greatest 
yields of high-quality algae. It would allow 
an accurate estimate of capital and opera­
tional costs and might indicate ways of re­
ducing them. Most important, at an experi­
mental processing plant, the best method of 
converting the algal product into a palatable 
and nutritious food could be studied. 
The cost of such a large-scale venture would 
be high. If all or even some of the countries 
interested in algal culture were to pool their 
efforts, the project would probably be both 
feasible and practicable. Though there is no 
80 evidence that any such joint enterprise is now 
being considered, within the next decade it may 
well be undertaken. As early as 1952, Brittain 
(1952) stated that "competent engineers are 
convinced that large-scale farming of Chlo1"ella 
presents no problem that cannot be solved." 
With the advances in our research and knowl­
edge over the past decade, this statement seems 
even more true today. An extensive practical 
test of our findings and a study of those ques­
tions that are still unanswered are the next 
necessary step. 
If a large-scale pilot plant were built, it 
would help solve another whole spectrum of 
problem involving the nutritive value and ac­
ceptability of algae. Researchers have com­
plained that the number of pilot plants has been 
so limited that accurate, long-term studies were 
not possible. Burlew (1953) estimated that 
he would need about 20 pound of algae per 
day to test different methods of processing and 
cooking and to undertake extensive feeding 
trials. More animal-feeding studie are needed 
before any large-scale human experiments can 
be undertaken. These studies will also require 
substantial supplies of algae a will studies to 
determine what fraction of the total nutritional 
needs of man can be supplied by algae. 
The effect of alga diet on longevity, re­
productive performance, disease incidence, and 
behavior must be analyzed in several pecies of 
animals before long-term feeding can even be 
considered for man. Such studies would also 
indicate if people can develop a tolerance to 
larger quantities and what such adaptation 
would entail. 
With the diversity and quality of biological 
experimental techniques now available, none 
of these studies seems beyond the range of feas­
ibility or practicality. Probably within the 
next few years, most of them will be done. 
Unless they raise new questions, the world will 
be substantiall y closer to a new source of food. 
The final unsolved problem is one to which 
no investigator has yet applied himself: Can 
people be persuaded to alter their food habits 
enough to make algae even a minor part of 
their diet? It is possible that technological 
advances in processing will make the green cells, palatable, but people in the Western 
world will still have to make social adjust­
ments to accept algae as daily fare. If the 
nations that are now threatened by widespread 
starvation are ever to raise the level of their 
people beyond one of subsistence, a project 
such as this one, accompanied by a massive 
informational campaign, might be a useful 
solution. 
Perhaps forward-thinking leaders of many 
nations will ultimately adopt the view ex­
pressed by Burlew (1953), who wrote: 
Such great advances in technology have already 
come from the coupling of engineering with bi­
ology that it seems inevitable that the production 
of food, at least in certain areas, will eventually 
be carried out by process industries. The large-scale culture of algae may well become the first 
of them. In regions of the world where popula­
tion is especially dense, and fertile land is limited, 
it is entirely possible that process-indu stry meth­
ods of producing food may furnish a respite from 
the threat of famine, and so contribute toward 
more salutary conditions for civilized living. 
It is not unduly optimistic to assert that 
mankind does possess today the necessary 
knowledge and power to solve the problem of 
hunger. The solution that has been discussed 
here is but one attempt among many that hold 
the promise of allowing all men --and future 
generations as well --to live in decency and 
:::omfort. If we have the vision, as well as the 
intelligence and will, to transform such pos­
sibilities into realities, the threat of starvation 
can be eliminated by the 21st century. 
SUMMARY 
Some 17,000 known species of algae in­
habit the fresh and marine waters of the world. 
Of these 17,000, only a few have been carefully 
investigated to determine their value as a 
human food resource. Those few that are of 
known commercial value are used worldwide 
in many forms and in many types of products. 
These include uses in such products as ferti­
lizers, animal foods, human foods, and incor­
poration into pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. 
One of the more promising algae having 
potential as a continuing human food resource 
is the unicellular green alga, Chlorella. This 
alga has several unique characteristics that 
contribute to its potential value. These include 
(1) rapid growth rate, (2) variability of com­
position as a result of varying the environment, 
which can be controlled, and (3) ability to re­
produce and grow in a closed system. Animal and human feeding studies have 
been made to determine the nutritive properties 
of Chlorella. Though several of the tests were 
inconclusive, the results generally indicate that 
Chlorella in its natural form is rather difficult 
for humans to digest, and the appearance of 
the product was not generally well accepted. 
The Japanese, however, have a high level of 
acceptance and tolerance for the product. This 
indicates that the digestive system of humans 
can adapt to various changes in the diet. Also, 
breaking down the cellular structure of Chlo­
rella by physical or chemical means would make 
this alga easily digestible. Additional studies 
to remove undesirable flavors and improve ap­
peal are needed if this product is to be used 
widely.

A. VARIATIONS IN CATCH FROM 
AREA TO AREA OVER THE 
ENTIRE GROUNDS DURING 1960-66 
1. Fishing Gear and Methods 
In the exploration of lhe ape Kennedy 
scallop grounds by the Bureau, an -foot and 
a 10-foot George Bank ea-scallop dredge and 
a 6-foot tumbler dredge (de cribed by Bulli 
and Cummin , 1961) were used. The dredge 
were single rigged. TO\\'ing time depended on 
the abundance of scallops and the amount of 
debris; the tows a\'eraged about 30 minutes. 
In areas where scallop catches were commer­
cially significant (20 bushel in the shell or 
more per hour), other drags were made to 
establish more precisely the availability of the 
scallops. In the calculations of the rate of 
catch, the dredges were tandardized to the 
fishing efficiency of an 8-foot Georges Bank 
sea-scallop dredge.
