The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of KOH-activated carbon derived from date 
press cake (DPC) for the adsorption of Pb(II) from aqueous solutions. Raw DPC was first converted 
into a carbonized material (CM) and then activated at dry KOH:CM weight ratios of 1:1 (AC1) and 
4:1 (AC4). The adsorbents were characterized using FTIR, FESEM-EDX, BET and Boehm titration 
method. AC1 and AC4 showed microporous structure with BET surface areas of 1237.2 and 2938.7 m2 
g–1, respectively. The prepared activated carbons (ACs) successfully adsorbed Pb(II) from aqueous 
solution with maximum monolayer adsorption capacities of 59.0 mg g–1 (AC1) and 101.3 mg g–1 (AC4). 
The adsorption of Pb(II) onto both ACs was well described by Elovich and pseudo-second order 
kinetic models, indicating that the rate of Pb(II) adsorption onto the ACs was mainly controlled by 
chemical adsorption. Isotherm study showed that the adsorption of Pb(II) onto AC1 took place in 
multilayer on a heterogeneous surface, while the Pb(II)/AC4 adsorption process occurred in a mono -
molecular layer with a homogenous distribution among the adsorption sites at different energies. 
This study showed that AC4 has a high specific surface area and successfully adsorbs Pb(II) even 
from saline aqueous solutions.

1. Introduction
Heavy metal pollution of aquatic ecosystems is a cru -
cial environmental problem [1]. Lead is among the high 
priority heavy metals and its toxic effect on human health 
is well-known documented [2]. Anthropogenic sources 
and uses of lead, through which it can be introduced into 
the environment, are activities related to alloys, pigments, 
antiknock agents, glassware, ceramics, plastic, tetramethyl 
lead, lead-acid batteries, cable sheathings, solder, and 
pipes or tubing [3].
The presence of Pb(II) in water may cause serious dam -
age to the liver, kidney, nervous system, reproductive sys -tem; reduce hemoglobin formation; and cause infertility 
and abnormalities in pregnant women [4,5]. Therefore, it is 
necessary to treat wastewater containing Pb(II) before being 
discharged into water streams for the protection of the envi -
ronment and public health.
The commonly used treatment methods for removing 
Pb(II) from wastewater are adsorption, chemical precipi -
tation, electrodialysis, photocatalysis, and membrane pro -
cesses [1,6]. Among them, adsorption process on activated 
carbon is known as an effective and simple method for the 
removal of heavy metals from aqueous solutions [7,8]. This 
adsorbent has highly porous structure with high surface 
reactivity and large surface area [9].
Large-scale application of commercial activated car -
bon may be problematic if this material be prepared from 
expensive and nonrenewable precursors. Therefore, in Z. Heidarinejad et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 165 (2019) 232–243233
recent years, the focus of researches has been directed into 
the production of activated carbon from cheap and renew -
able precursors [9,10]. In this regards, some researches 
have focused on Pb(II) removal from aqueous solutions 
using activated carbons prepared from abundant agricul -
tural biomass such as cherry kernels [11], palm oil mill 
effluent [12], lemon peel [13], tamarind wood [14] and 
Cucumis melo peel [15].
Date palm Phoenix dactylifera is a subtropical and trop -
ical tree, which is cultivated in 30 countries [16]. According 
to FAO report, the worldwide amount of date fruit produc -
tion was around 8.5 million tons in 2016 [17]. In date pro -
cessing industries, various products including date pastes, 
date juice concentrates, and fermented date products 
(organic acids, vinegar and alcohol) are produced from date 
fruits [16]. In such industries, a major portion of date fruit, 
i.e. Date Press Cake (DPC), is remained on filter presses 
after extracting its liquid products [18,19]. In Iran, in which 
around 1.16 million tons date fruit was produced in 2016 
[17], a huge amount of DPC is generated daily and mainly 
dumped into open lands and drains [19].
Up to date, numerous studies have been done on the 
preparation of activated carbon from different parts of 
the palm tree including palm kernel shell [20,21], date 
palm leaflets [22,23] and date palm fibers [24,25]. How -
ever, limited studies have focused on the conversion 
of DPC into activated carbon [19,26]. To the best of our 
knowledge, the activated carbon prepared from DPC has 
not been used for the adsorption of Pb(II) from aqueous 
solutions. 
According to literature, initial carbonization of organic 
precursors improves their porosity and facilitates the pen -
etration of activating agent into the carbonized material of 
char structure during final chemical activation [27]. On the 
other hand, the unstable structure of raw DPC with pulpy 
structure in aqueous solution troubles with its chemical 
activation through impregnation method. Therefore, in 
this study, raw DPC was converted into activated carbon 
through a two-stage dry chemical activation procedure; car -
bonization and physical mixing of carbonized material with 
various amounts of dry KOH. The main aim of this study 
was to evaluate the efficiency of the KOH-activated carbon 
derived from DPC for the adsorption of Pb(II) from aque -
ous solution. The kinetics and isotherms of Pb(II) adsorp -
tion onto the ACs were analyzed by non-linear form of the 
kinetic and isotherm models. The main morphological, tex -
tural and chemical characterizations of the ACs were also 
analyzed. 
2. Material and methods
2.1. Chemicals and materials
Lead nitrate ( ≥99.9% purity), potassium hydroxide 
(≥99.0% purity), hydrochloric acid ( ≥37% purity), Sodium 
hydroxide ( ≥99.0% purity), sodium hydrogen carbonate 
(≥99.0% purity) and sodium carbonate ( ≥ 98.0% purity) 
were purchased from Merck Co., Germany. Initially, a Pb(II) 
stock solution (1000 mg L–1) was prepared from lead nitrate, 
then working solutions were obtained from the stock solu -
tion. Raw DPC, a pasty material, was obtained from a local 
date fruit processing industry. 2.2. Preparation of activated carbon
Raw DPC was first dried at 110°C and its particle size 
was reduced to less than 1 mm. Pretests showed that a sig -
nificant amount of raw DPC (mainly soluble fraction) was 
lost during its direct impregnation with KOH solution. In 
this regard, activated carbon was prepared through a two-
step procedure, i.e. initial carbonization and chemical acti -
vation with NaOH pellets under dry conditions. First, the 
dried DPC was placed in a horizontal stainless steel reactor 
and heated up to 500°C in a furnace at a rate of 20°C min–1 
and kept at this temperature for 2 h. The obtained carbon -
ized material (CM) was then physically mixed with KOH 
pellets at KOH:CM weight ratios of 1:1 and 4:1. 
The mixture of KOH and CM was placed into a stainless 
steel reactor and heated up to 750°C at the rate of 20°C min–1 
and kept at this condition for 1.5 h. Carbonization, chemi -
cal activation and cooling stages were performed under the 
nitrogen flow of 100 cm3 min–1. 
After activation, the prepared activated carbon was sep -
arated from alkaline material through repeatedly washing 
the mixture with deionized water and dilute HCl (0.1 M) 
on a filter until the filtrate pH became neutral. Finally, the 
obtained activated carbon samples were dried in oven at 
110ºC for 24 h. The activated carbons prepared at KOH:CM 
weight ratios of 1:1 and 4:1 were labeled as AC1 and AC4, 
respectively, and used in Pb(II) adsorption experiments.
The yields of carbonized material and activated carbon 
production from raw DPC were determined as:
YieldW
WC
R%()=× 100 (1)
where WC and WR are dry weights of products (CM or ACs) 
and raw DPC (g), respectively. 
2.3. Adsorbent characterization
Textural properties of AC1 and AC4 were analyzed by 
N2 adsorption-desorption at 77 K using a surface area ana -
lyzer (Belsorp-mini II, BEL Japan Inc., Osaka, Japan). The 
specific surface area or SBET of the ACs was determined by 
Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation. Total pore volume 
(VT) of ACs was determined as the maximum amount of 
nitrogen which adsorbed at the relative pressure (P/P0) of 
0.99 [28]. Micropore volume was determined through t-plot 
according to IUPAC [29] and the mesopore volume ( Vm) 
was calculated as the difference between total and microp -
ore volumes [30]. The average pore diameter (D) was calcu -
lated from the relation D = 4 VT/SBET [31].
The morphology and elemental composition of AC1 and 
AC4 were analyzed by a field emission scanning electron 
microscope equipped with a dispersive X-ray spectrometer 
(FESEM-EDX, Tescan Mira 3 LMU). 
The functional groups present on the surfaces of 
AC1 and AC4 were ascertained by a Fourier Transform 
Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) Nicolet Avatar 360 (Nico -
let, USA). The FT-IR spectra of the materials, with 4 cm–1 
resolution and 20 scans min–1, were recorded between 
4000–400 cm–1 through potassium bromide (KBr) pellet 
method.
Additionally, the chemical characteristics of AC1 and 
AC4 surfaces were analyzed by Boehm titration method Z. Heidarinejad et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 165 (2019) 232–243234
[32,33]. The point of zero charge pH (pHPZC) of the ACs 
was determined by pH drift method as proposed by Liu 
et al. [34].
2.4. Adsorption experiments
Batch Adsorption experiments were carried out by 
taking 25 ml of Pb(II) solution into 50 ml flasks. All experi -
ments were done at a shaking rate of 250 rpm under room 
temperature (298±0.5 K). 
The effect of solution pH (2–7) on Pb(II) adsorption was 
evaluated with initial Pb(II) concentration of 100 mg L–1 at 
120 min contact time. The kinetics of Pb(II) adsorption on 
the ACs were analyzed at contact times ranged from 2.5 
to 120 min with initial Pb(II) concentration of 100 mg L–1 
and the selected pH value. Isotherm study was carried out 
under the following conditions: initial Pb(II) concentrations 
ranged from 5 to 200 mg Pb L–1, equilibrium contact time 
and selected pH value.
The effect of ionic strength on the adsorption system was 
evaluated with deionized water containing 200 mg L–1 and 
various molar NaCl concentrations (0–1 M) at equilibrium 
contact time and selected pH value. In all experiments, the 
pH of solutions was adjusted by dilute HCl or NaOH and 
measured with a pH meter (WTW, Germany).
At the end of each run, the solutions were filtered 
and the residual concentration of Pb(II) was measured by 
atomic absorption spectroscopy (Younglin AAS 8020, South 
Korea). All calibration and sample solutions were acidified 
before measuring their Pb(II) content.
The capacities of ACs for the adsorption of Pb(II) at 
equilibrium condition ( qe) and at time t ( qt) were calculated 
as follows:
qCC V
Weie=−() (2)
qCC V
Wtit=−() (3)
where Ci, Ce and Ct are the initial, equilibrium and at time 
t of Pb(II) concentrations (mg Pb L–1), respectively,  V is the 
volume of suspension (L), and W is the dry weight of the 
ACs in suspension (g).
2.5. Data analysis
Five common kinetic models including pseudo-first 
order, pseudo-second order, Elovich, intraparticle dif -
fusion and Boyd’s were used for the kinetics of Pb(II) 
adsorption onto the ACs. Moreover, four isotherm mod -
els, namely Freundlich, Langmuir, Redlich-Peterson, 
and Temkin, were used to analyze the experimental Pb 
(II) equilibrium adsorption data (Table S1). The non-lin -
ear forms of all isotherm models and kinetic models, 
except intraparticle diffusion and Boyd models, were 
fitted to the experimental adsorption data using Origin -
Lab Pro (2018) software. Finally, the best-fitted kinetic 
and isotherm models were identified by the coefficient 
of determination (R2) and average relative error (ARE) 
(Table S2).3. Results and discussion
3.1. Yield and textural characterization of the material
The yield of CM preparation from raw DPC was 45.5%, 
while the yield values for AC1 and AC4 were 30.94% and 
22.47%, respectively. These values are comparable to those 
reported for some KOH-activated carbons derived from 
agro-industrial wastes reported in the literature [35–37]. 
The decrease in AC1 yield compared to that of CM could 
be related to the intercalation of K into the CM structure 
and its subsequent elimination and dehydration reactions 
[38]. Such phenomena probably resulted in further decrease 
in yield of AC prepared with KOH:CM weight ratio of 4:1.
The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms and the pore 
size distribution of AC1 and AC4 are shown in Fig. 1. 
According to IUPAC (International Union of Pure and 
Applied Chemistry) classification, the isotherm profile 
obtained for AC1 and AC4 could be classified as type I 
(b), which is characteristic of microporous materials hav -
ing pore size distributions over a broad range including 
wide micropores and possibly narrow mesopores [29]. 
Such microporous feature of ACs is reflected in pore size 
distribution plot, which indicates that the most of pores 
had sizes smaller than 2 nm (Fig. 1b, c). As shown in Table 
1, the SBET of AC4 (2938.7 m2 g−1) was higher than that of 
AC1 (1237.2 m2 g−1). Nieto-Márquez et al. [39] and Muni -
andy et al. [40] also reported that the SBET of activated 
carbons prepared from waste tire and rice husk, respec -
tively, was increased by applying higher KOH:CM weight 
ratios. Therefore, heating of CM in the presence of higher 
amount of activating agent promoted the surface area of 
AC. Accordingly, the VT of AC4 was far higher than that 
of AC1. The higher SBET and VT of AC4 could be related to 
the more intercalation of the alkaline metal into the carbon 
structure in the presence of higher amount of KOH. How -
ever, the microporosity of AC was decreased when CM was 
activated at higher KOH:CM ratio, which indicates that the 
spaces between atomic layers of carbon were widen in the 
presence of more activating agent [31,40]. Considering the 
SBET of CM (3.47 m2 g–1), a micro-mesoporous activated car -
bon with high specific surface area (2938.7 m2 g−1) could be 
produced by KOH-activating of DPC under dry conditions. 
The activation mechanism with KOH is in accordance with 
the following main reactions [41]:
62 23 222 3 KOHC KH KC O +→ ++  (4)
22 222 KOHC KC OH +→ ++  (5)
The KOH penetration into the carbon structure, fol -
lowed by burn-off of carbon bonds and release of gaseous 
products probably are the main causes of the porosity 
development.
FESEM images of AC1 and AC4 are presented in Fig. 2. 
As can be seen, the surface alteration and porosity were 
more pronounced in AC4.
The EDX analysis results for the elemental composi -
tion of CM and ACs are shown in Table 2. As can be seen, 
carbon is the main elements constituting the CM and ACs. 
In addition, the K content of the ACs was less than that of 
CM the negligible amount of K in the activated carbons 
indicating the efficient removal of the remaining KOH Z. Heidarinejad et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 165 (2019) 232–243235
during the washing step. Overall, the higher content of 
carbon in ACs indicates the more purity of the ACs com -
pared to CM.
3.2. Chemical surface characterization
FT-IR spectroscopy was used to identify the main char -
acteristics functional groups present on the AC1 and AC4 
surfaces (Fig. 3). According to AC1 spectrum, the band at 
3436 cm–1 is attributed to –OH functional group,including 
hydrogen interactions. The band located at around 2855 cm−1 corresponds to C-H stretching vibration. The peak 
appeared at 1722 cm–1 can be assigned to C=O axial defor -
mation of aldehyde, lactone, ketone and carboxyl groups. 
The spectrum peaked at 1086 cm−1 is attributed to C-O such 
as that in alcohols, phenols, acids, ethers or esters. The band 
at 476 cm–1 is the characteristic of the vibrational mode 
of C-N-C group. Compared to the AC1 spectrum, some 
changes can be noted in the position and intensity of some 
peaks in the AC4 spectrum. As shown in Fig. 3, the position 
of peaks related to –OH, C-H, C-C, C-O and C-N-C were at 
3440, 2922, 1431, 1086 and 473 cm–1 in AC4 spectrum.
Oxygen functional groups present on the adsorbent 
surface significantly contribute in adsorption process 
because they act as active sites which are capable to attract 
adsorbate molecules [28]. Boehm titration method was 
used to quantify the oxygen functional groups present 
on the ACs. It was found that the amounts of acid func -
tional groups in AC1 and AC4 were 0.38 and 1.01 mmol 
g–1, respectively. Therefore, activation with higher amount 
of KOH increased the content of acid functional groups 
in the prepared activated carbon. The higher content of 
oxygen-containing (acidic functional) groups in AC4 com -
pared to AC1 is in accordance to the higher oxygen content 
of AC4 (Table 2). 
3.3. Effect of pH on Pb(II) adsorption
The chemistry of adsorbate in aqueous solution and 
the ionic state of functional groups on the adsorbent sur -
face depends on the solution pH [42]. The experiments 
for the effect of initial pH on the adsorption of Pb(II) were 
done at solution pH ranged from 2 to 7 and the results are 
presented in Fig. 4. As can be seen from the figure, the 
RE of Pb(II) onto both ACs was negligible at pH 2 and 
increased to 68.58% (AC1) and 95.0% (AC4) at pH 6 (final 
pH = 5.97).
At acidic pH, H+ ions compete with cationic metal ions 
to adsorb on the adsorbent surface. Therefore, the inhibi -
tory effect of H+ ions on the adsorption of Pb(II) would 
be decreased with the increase in solution pH [43]. As is 
known, the ACs surfaces acquired positive charge at pH < 
pHPZC (pHPZC > 6 for both ACs) and negative charge at pH > 
pHPZC [44]. Therefore, the net charge on both ACs was posi -
tive for the pH values ranged from 2 to 6. In this condition, 
the repulsive interaction between Pb(II) and ACs surface 
probably was increased at more acidic conditions, further 
decreasing the amount of Pb(II) adsorption [45,46].

It should be noted that the distribution of Pb(II) species 
in aqueous solution is a function of the pH of the solution. In 
general, the reaction of hydrolysis of lead ions is as follows: 
Pb nHOP bOHn HOn
n+ − ++ () +2
22
3 2  (6)
where n is changed at various pH values [47]. The main 
species of lead in pH values greater than 7 are mainly low 
soluble hydroxides [48]. Therefore, the precipitation of a 
portion of lead hydroxide may start at pH values above 7 
[49]. In this regard, in accordance to the numerous studies 
on the adsorption of Pb(II) from aqueous solution (Table 3), 
pH of 6 was selected for subsequent experiments in order 
to confirm that no hydroxide precipitation occurred during 
the adsorption process. It must be noted that the pH of the 
solutions with initial pH of 6 did not increase at the end of 
experiment.

3.4. Adsorption kinetics
Contact time is an inevitable parameter during mass 
transfer stage in adsorption process. The effect of contact 
time on the adsorption of Pb(II) onto AC1 and AC4 was 
studied with initial Pb(II) concentration of 100 mg L–1, 
adsorbate dose of 1 g L–1 and pH of 6. As shown in Fig. 
5, it is clear that the rate of Pb(II) adsorption was rapidly 
increased in the beginning and gradually increased until 
equilibrium was reached. At the beginning of adsorption 
process, the concentration of Pb(II) ions in solution (as driv -
ing force) was high and all of active sites on the adsorbent 
surface were vacant. After a given time (around 45 min), the 
reduced amounts of Pb(II) ions and vacant surface active 
sites probably led to negligible increase in Pb(II) uptake 
with time. 
Adsorption kinetic studies are very important for 
understanding the order of reaction rate and the dynam -
ics of the adsorption reaction [50]. In order to find the best 
kinetic model describing the adsorption of Pb(II) onto AC1 
and AC4, the kinetic models of pseudo-first order [51], 
pseudo-second order [52] and Elovich [53] were nonlinearly 
fitted to experimental data (Fig. 5).
The magnitude of R2 and ARE values listed in Table 4 
indicate that the adsorption of Pb(II) onto the ACs were 
well fitted by pseudo-second order and Elovich models.
The Elovich model assumes that the interactions between 
adsorbate molecules on the adsorbent surface are not influ -
enced by adsorption kinetics at low surface coverage. It also 
assumes that the surface of adsorbent is energetically het -
erogeneous [54]. The pseudo-second order model assumes 
that the sorption process involves a chemical reaction. It 
also assumes the proportional relationship between sorp -
tion capacity and number of active sites on the sorbent 
[55]. In this regard, the adsorption of Pb(II) onto both ACs 
occurred predominantly by chemisorption.
The kinetic constants of h0 and α are indicative of initial 
adsorption rate. According to Table 4, the values of these 
constants for the adsorption of Pb(II) onto AC4 were higher 
than those obtained for Pb(II)/AC1 system. Therefore, it 
seems that the higher SBET provided more vacant sites at the 
beginning of adsorption process compared to that of AC1. 
The intraparticle diffusion model proposed by Weber 
and Morris [56] was applied in order to understand how the 
diffusion of Pb(II) molecules onto AC1 and AC4 takes place. 
This model assumes that the adsorption process occurs in 
three stages including mass transfer to the external surface of the sorbent, mass transfer to the sorbent internal surface, 
and then adsorption of adsorbate molecules onto active 
adsorbent sites [57].
The values of intraparticle diffusion constants, kid and 
Ci, were determined through plotting qt vs. t0.5 (Fig. 6a). kid 
and Ci represent intraparticle diffusion rate constant (mg 
g–1 min–0.5) and the thickness of boundary layer (mg g–1), 
respectively. As seen from Fig. 6a, the data points do not 
fall on a straight line, but they could be aligned in two dis -
tinct linear stages. The first sharper stage is related to the 
instantaneous adsorption of Pb(II) molecules, and the sec -
ond stage is attributed to the intraparticle diffusion of Pb(II) Table 3

molecules through the pores of the ACs. The intercept of 
the first stage plots, Ci, gives an insight into the tendency 
of the adsorbate to be adsorbed on the adsorbent or remain 
in solution [24]. According to Table 5, the value of C1 was 
greater in Pb(II)/AC4 system (77.6 mg g–1) compared to that 
of Pb(II)/AC1 system (40.2 mg g–1), depicting higher ten -
dency of AC4 surface to the Pb(II) ions than AC1. As shown 
in Fig. 6, the linear lines did not pass through the origin, 
suggesting that the intraparticle diffusion was not the only 
limiting mechanism in the adsorption process.
The Boyd model [58] is used to identify the limiting step 
of speed between film diffusion and intraparticle diffusion. 
If Boyd’s plot (Bt versus time) is linear and passes from the 
origin of the coordinates, intraparticle diffusion is the only 
limiting factor in the adsorption process, but nonetheless, 
the liquid film diffusion controls the process [59].
As shown in Fig. 6b, although the Boyd plots for the 
adsorption of Pb(II) onto both ACs present some linear -
ity, but they do not pass through the origin. Therefore, the 
adsorption rate of Pb(II) onto both ACs were mainly con -
trolled by the film diffusion or chemical reaction.
3.5 Adsorption isotherm
Adsorption isotherms are mathematical relations that 
are useful for understanding how the adsorbate molecules 
are partitioned between the aqueous and solid phases 
under equilibrium condition [26].
In order to analyze the adsorption isotherm of Pb(II) 
on AC1 and AC4, the nonlinear forms of Freundlich, Lang -
muir, Redlich-Peterson and Temkin models were fitted to 
the equilibrium adsorption data (Fig. 7).
The Freundlich isotherm assumes multilayer adsorp -
tion onto heterogeneous surfaces, while Langmuir isotherm 
describe monolayer adsorption (the adsorbed layer is one 
molecule in thickness) onto homogenous surfaces [60,61].
The Redlich-Peterson isotherm is a hybrid isotherm, in 
which both Freundlich and Langmuir features are com -
bined [62]. Temkin model assumes that the adsorption heat 
increases linearly with the coverage of adsorbent [63].
The values of R2 and ARE presented in Table 6 imply that 
the adsorption of Pb(II) onto AC1 was well described by 
Temkin and Redlich-Peterson models. On the other hand, 
Redlich-Peterson model well described the experimental 
data of Pb(II) adsorption on AC4. Redlich-Peterson model 
is generally applied to show the adsorption equilibrium in 
a wide range of adsorbate concentrations in homogeneous 
and heterogeneous systems according to their compatibility 
[64]. If g = 0, the Redlich-Peterson equation behaves as Hen -
ry’s law, while it will behave according to the Langmuir iso -
therm when the value of g tends to 1. On the other hand, If 
g < 1 and the values of aRP and bRP parameters be far higher 
than 1, Redlich-Peterson equation converges to Freundlich 
approach [19,64]. With respect to the values of g, aRP and bRP 
presented in Table 7 for Pb(II)/AC1 adsorption system, the 
Redlich-Peterson model more likely behaved as Freundlich 
approach than Langmuir approach. Moreover, the values 
of R2/ARE imply that the adsorption of Pb(II) onto AC1 
best described by Temkin isotherm model. Therefore, the 
well description of Pb(II)/AC1 isotherm and kinetic data 
with Temkin/Freundlich and Elovich models, respectively, 
indicates that the adsorption of Pb(II) onto AC1 was a mul -

tilayer sorption, and the adsorption took place on a hetero -
geneous surface.
With respect to the g value ( ≈1) and the values of R2/
ARE for isotherm models (Table 6), it can be concluded that 
the Langmuir model well described Pb(II)/AC4 adsorption 
system. On the other hand, as noted previously, the kinetic 
data of Pb(II)/AC4 adsorption were well fitted with Elovich 
model. Therefore, it seems that the Pb(II)/AC4 adsorption 
process occurred in a monomolecular layer with a homog -
enous distribution among the adsorption sites at different 
energies. 
The separation factor ( RL), in the Langmuir model, was 
used to determine if the adsorption process is favorable (0 
< RL < 1), linear ( RL = 1), or unfavorable ( RL > 1) [40]. For the 
range of applied initial Pb(II) concentrations (5–200 mg L−1), 
the RL values decreased from 0.3784 to 0.0149 for Pb(II)/
AC1 system and from 0.0599 to 0.0015 for Pb(II)/AC4 sys -tem, indicating the favorability of Pb(II) adsorption onto the 
ACs in the concentration range studied.
The maximum monolayer adsorption capacities ( qm) for 
AC1 and AC4 were 58.96 and 101.28 mg g–1, respectively, 
which are considerable compared to those reported for 
several biomass-derived ACs applied for Pb(II) adsorption 
(Table 3). The isotherm study showed that Pb(II) was more 
favorably adsorbed onto AC4 than that of AC1. Therefore, 
AC4 showed better potential for the adsorption of Pb(II) 
probably due to higher specific surface area, higher pore 
volume and higher content of oxygen functional groups. 
Moreover, the proportion of mesopores in AC4 (21.39%) was 
higher than that of AC1 (9.85%) (Table 1). It is well known 
that the presence of mesopores may facilitate the transfer of 
heavy metal ions like Pb(II) within the sorbent structure [68].
3.6. Effect of ionic strength on Pb(II) adsorption
Wastewater from many industries such as textile dye -
ing, leather tanning, plating and so often contains various 
levels of ionic strength due to presence of salts like sodium 
chloride. The ionic strength of aqueous solution may affect 
the adsorption of metals [69].
The effect of solution ionic strength on the adsorption 
system was tested with deionized water containing various 
molar concentrations of NaCl (up to 1 mol). As can be seen 
from Fig. 8, the fluctuation in the rate of Pb(II) adsorption Table 5

from aqueous solutions with various ionic strengths was 
negligible (<2 mg g–1 for both ACs). Abdulkarim et al. [70]
also reported the negligible effect of ionic strength origi -
nated from NaCl on the adsorption of Pb(II) onto the acti -
vated carbon produced from Date Pits. It is well known that 
the outer-sphere surface complexation is significantly influ -
enced by the changes in ionic strength of aqueous solution, 
while inner-sphere surface complexation between adsor -
bate and adsorbent surface is ionic strength independent 
[71]. Therefore, the insensitivity of Pb(II)/ACs system to 
ionic strength is an indicative of inner-sphere surface com -
plexation, in which Pb(II) formed in-plane covalent bonds 
with the ACs surfaces [72]. Then, it seems that the electro -
static attraction had negligible role in the adsorption of 
Pb(II) onto the ACs surfaces at near neutral condition [73]. 
It should be noted that NaCl-Pb(II)/ACs system may 
not be controlled just by inner-sphere surface complex -
ation. In the presence of NaCl, the adsorption of a part of 
Pb/(II) which probably adsorbed through outer-sphere 
complexation may be reduced due to the formation of 
Pb-Cl complex. This reduced Pb(II) adsorption rate may be 
compensated by precipitation of a part of Pb-Cl complexes. 
Overall, the negligible change of Pb(II) adsorption rate with 
increasing NaCl concentration is a resultant of all possible 
phenomena in NaCl-Pb(II)/ACs system.
4. Conclusion
In this study, date press cake, an agro-industrial waste, 
was converted into activated carbon through a two-stage 
procedure; carbonization and activation at 750°C with two 
different solid KOH:CM weight ratios (1:1 and 4:1). The 
adsorption of Pb(II) onto both ACs was well described by 
Elovich and pseudo-second order kinetic models, illustrat -
ing that the Pb(II) adsorption onto the ACs was predomi -
nantly a chemisorption process. Isotherm study illustrated 
multilayer adsorption of Pb(II) onto AC1 which took place 
on a heterogeneous surface. However, it was found that 
the Pb(II)/AC4 adsorption process occurred in a mono -
molecular layer with a homogenous distribution among 
the adsorption sites at different energies. AC4 showed 
higher SBET and pore volume and contained more oxygen 
functional groups than AC1. Due to such properties, AC4 
showed better performance for the adsorption of Pb(II) from aqueous solution. The adsorption system was not 
significantly influenced by ionic strength originated from 
NaCl. Therefore, the KOH-activated carbon derived from 
DPC could be successfully applied for the removal of Pb(II) 
even from saline aqueous solutions.
