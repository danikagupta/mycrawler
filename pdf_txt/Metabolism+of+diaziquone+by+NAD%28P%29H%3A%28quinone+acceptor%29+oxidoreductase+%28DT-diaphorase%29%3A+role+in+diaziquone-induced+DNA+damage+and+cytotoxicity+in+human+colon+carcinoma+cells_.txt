1. ABSTRACT
Quinone-containing alkylating agents are a class
of chemical agents that have received considerable  interest
as anticancer drugs.   These agents contain a quinone moiety
that can be reduced and an alkylating group that can form
covalent bonds with a variety of cellular components.  The
oxidation state of the quinone element can modulate the
activity of the alkylating element, and reduction of the
quinone is required for activation of the alkylating activity
of many of these agents.  The quinone element may alsocontribute to the cytotoxic activity of quinone-containing
alkylating agents through the formation of reactive oxygen
species during redox cycling.  The natural product,
mitomycin C, has been the most widely used quinone-
containing alkylating agent in the clinic, but other quinone-
containing alkylating agents like porfiromycin, diaziquone,
carbazilquinone, triaziquone and EO9 havealso been used
in the clinic for the treatment of cancer.  In addition, many
other quinone-containing alkylating agents have been testedClinical use of quinone-containing alkylating agents
154in preclinical studies and the development of new agents is
being actively pursued.  This chapter describes the current
and past clinical uses of these agents in the treatment of
cancer and  discusses new agents that are currently in
clinical trials.
2. INTRODUCTION
2.1. Historical Perspective
Quinone-containing alkylating agents are a class
of chemical agents that have received considerable  interest
as anticancer drugs since the late 1950s (1).  These agents
contain a quinone moiety that can be reduced and an
alkylating group that can form covalent bonds with a
variety of cellular components.  Simple alkylating agents
were among the first effective agents for the treatment of
cancer (2 ).  The nitrogen mustard, HN2, was first tested in
the clinic in 1942, and this agent is still used clinically for
the treatment of lymphomas (3).  Other nitrogen mustards
like chlorambucil, melphalan and cyclophosphamide were
introduced shortly afterwards and remain important drugs
in many treatment regimens (4).  Other alkylating agents
ontaining methane sulfonates, like busulfan (5),  and
aziridines, like thiotepa (6) were also early antitumor
agents.  Putter (7) suggested that combining a
benzoquinone with alkylating groups would produce
compounds with potent antitumor activity.  This suggestion
was supported by the studies of Holzer et al (1) who
showed that a number of aziridinyl benzoquinones had very
good antitumor activity, and by the isolation of the
quinone-containing mitomycin antitumor antibiotics (8,9).
Mitomycin C was extensively tested in animals (8,10) and
humans (11-13) in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and was
shown to be an effective clinical agent.  These findings
prompted a proliferation of synthetic and biological studies
of quinone-containing alkylators as potential antitumor
agents (14-16).  Many of these agents showed good
antitumor activity in cell culture or animal models.
Studies of  the mechanism of action of mitomycin
C demonstrated that this agent required reductive
activation, which was followed by the formation of DNA
adducts and strand breaks (17,18).  This finding was
consistent with earlier predictions by Ross (19) that the
oxidation state of the quinone group could influence the
activity of an adjacent alkylating moiety.  Sartorelli et al.
(20) used this principle to prepare a series of benzoquinone
and naphthoquinone compounds, which had the potential to
alkylate after reduction, as potential “bioreductive
alkylating agents”.  These agents were able to bind to DNA
and demonstrated antitumor activity (20).  These studies
lead to increased interest in the development of quinone-
containing alkylating agents as antitumor agents and in
understanding their mechanism of action.
2.2. Mechanism of Action of Quinone-containing
Alkylating Agents
Quinone-containing alkylating agents contain two
important structural elements that contribute to their
activity.  The alkylating element can form covalent bonds
to cellular components including proteins, membranes and
DNA; however, the interaction with DNA is generallythought to be the most important contributor to the
antitumor activity of these agents (21).  This interaction can
result in the formation of DNA monoadducts, or in the case
of bifunctional alkylating agents, DNA crosslinks (22,23),
leading to the induction of apoptosis (24) and cell death
(25).  The oxidation state of the quinone element can
modulate the activity of the alkylating element, and
reduction of the quinone is required for activation of the
alkylating activity of agents such as mitomycin C (26,27)
and EO9 (26,28).  The most important activating enzymes
for quinone-containing alkylating agents appear to be the
one-electron reducing enzyme, NADPH:cytochrome P450
reductase (21,27,29,30), and the two-electron reducing
enzyme, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (DT-
diaphorase) (21,29,31-34).  However, not all agents may
require reductive activation (35), and reduction of the
quinone group by some enzymes may decrease the activity
of these agents (36).  The quinone element may also
contribute to the cytotoxic activity of quinone-containing
alkylating agents through the formation of reactive oxygen
species during redox cycling.  Reactive oxygen species can
damage cellular components, including DNA
(21,23,37,38), but this seems to be a minor contributor to
the antitumor activity of bioreductive agents (39,40).
2.3. Clinical Application of Quinone-containing
Alkylating Agents
  The n atural product, mitomycin C, has been the
most widely used quinone-containing alkylating agent in
the clinic, but other quinone-containing alkylating agents
like porfiromycin, diaziquone, carbazilquinone, triaziquone
and EO9 have also been used in the clinic for the treatment
of cancer.  In addition, many other quinone-containing
alkylating agents have been tested in preclinical studies and
the development of new agents is being actively pursued.
This chapter will describe the current and past clinical uses
of these agents in the treatment of cancer and will discuss
new agents that are currently in clinical trials.
3. CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF MITOMYCINS
3.1. History
The mitomycins were first discovered by Hata et
al (8) in 1956, and mitomycin C was isolated by Wakaki et
al (9) from Streptomyces caespitosus  in 1958.  Four
mitomycins occur naturally (Figure 1).  All are antibiotics
effective against both gram positive and gram negative
bacteria (41), but only mitomycin C and porfiromycin have
appreciable anticancer activity.  Mitomycin C has been
used clinically in Japan since the early 1960's (42), but this
agent was not approved for general use in North America
until 1974 (43).  Since then mitomycin C has been used to
treat a wide variety of solid tumors, but its utility has been
decreased by toxicity.  Porfiromycin has also received
limited clinical use, and a number of mitomycin analogues
have been investigated (42).
3.2. Mechanism of Action
The mitomycins require intracellular activation (26)
by one electron reducing enzymes like NADPH:cytochrome
P450 reductase (26,39) or NADH:cytochrome b 5 reductase
(44), or by two electron reducing enzymes like DT-diaphoraseClinical use of quinone-containing alkylating agents

(21,31) or xanthine dehydrogenase (45); however,
NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase  (21,29,30) and DT-
diaphorase (28,29,31-34) are the most important activating
enzymes.  Reduction of the mitomycins activates the aziridine
and carbamate alkylating groups and results in the formation of
DNA crosslinks which appear to be the primary mechanism
for the antitumor effects of these agents (21-23). If oxygen is
present, the reduced mitomycin products can redox cycle to
form reactive oxygen species.  Reactive oxygen species
damage cellular components, including DNA (21,23,37,46),
but this seems to be a minor contributor to the antitumor
activity of these agents (39).  The mitomycins are generally
more active under hypoxic conditions and can act as
radiosensitizers (26,33).
3.3. Mitomycin C
3.3.1. Clinical Applications
Mitomycin C has been used for the clinical
treatment of human cancers for more than 25 years.
Despite multiple clinical trials, the use and effectiveness of
this agent remains confined to a small number of cancer
types.  Mitomycin C has proved to be most effective in the
front line treatment of a small number of solid tumors, such
as superficial bladder cancer (47) and gastric (48),
pancreatic (49), anal (50) and esophageal (51) carcinomas.
It is also used in palliative treatment of advanced cancers or
cancers that have become resistant to other forms of
therapy, generally in combination regimens with
doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil or with bleomycin and
vincristine (43,52,53).  However, the activity of this agent
in solid tumors and its enhanced effectiveness against
hypoxic cells that are resistant to radiation (26) have
resulted in continued interest in mitomycin C and the
investigation of new approaches to increasing its
effectiveness.
Superficial bladder cancer represents
approximately 70% of all bladder cancers at time of
presentation (47,54).  Transurethral resection is the primary
treatment for this disease, but tumors will recur in 50% of
all patients (54).  Thus, patients at highest risk for tumor
recurrence generally receive adjuvant intravesical therapywith anticancer drugs such as mitomycin C, thiotepa or
doxorubicin, or with immunotherapy with Bacillus
Calmette-Guerin (BCG).  Many clinical studies have
established the effectiveness of mitomycin C for the
treatment of superficial bladder cancer, with complete
response rates of from 39% to 77% reported (47).  The
efficacy of mitomycin C in the adjuvant setting in
preventing the recurrence of tumors has also been
confirmed (47,55).  Drug doses of 20-40 mg by instillation
after transurethral resection and then weekly for 6 to 8
weeks (47,56) with, or without monthly maintenance
treatments have been used (56,57).  Furthermore, recent
studies comparing mitomycin C and BCG showed that
there was no difference in tumor progression or survival
with these two agents, but that BCG might be superior in
preventing tumor recurrence (56) possibly at the expense of
greater adverse reactions (58).
Adenocarcinoma of the stomach is a highly
malignant tumor with a poor prognosis (49).  This disease
is a major cause of cancer mortality in Japan and other
Asian countries, and many patients present with advanced
disease which is not curable by surgery alone (48).
Mitomycin C has been used extensively as a single agent in
the treatment of gastric cancer, especially in Japan with an
overall objective response rate of 30% (49).  This compares
favorably with other single agent therapy with 5-FU or
doxorubicin.  More recently, mitomycin C has also been
extensively used in a number of combination chemotherapy
regimens, most notable in the FAM regimen with 5-FU and
doxorubicin (48,49,59,60).  Mitomycin C is typically given
as an i.v. bolus at 10 mg/m2 on day 1 of a 6 to 10 week
cycle.  The response rates have been approximately 30%
with a small number of complete responders.  Although this
adjuvant treatment increased the time to progression it did
not alter survival time in patients with more advanced
disease (49).  Thus, mitomycin C regimens provide only
limited benefit in gastric cancer.
Pancreatic carcinoma has a simil ar incidence to
gastric cancer in North America and also has a poor
prognosis.  This disease is highly resistant to chemotherapyClinical use of quinone-containing alkylating agents
156but response rates of approximately 25% have been seen
with 5-FU or mitomycin C as single agents or with
combinations of these agents (49).  However, these
treatments have little effect on overall survival.  More
recent trials to investigate the use of preoperative radiation
and chemotherapy with 5-FU and mitomycin C to enhance
resectability have provided encouraging results (61,62).
Epidermoid carcinomas of the anal region
represent only a small proportion of large bowel cancers
(63).   When these cancers were treated by radical surgery,
the 5-year survival rate ranged from 40% to 60% with local
relapses being common.  More recently, radiotherapy
combined with 5-FU and mitomycin C have been
extensively used in the treatment of this disease.  A number
of  clinical trials have demonstrated that the concomitant
use of radiotherapy and chemotherapy produced a
significant improvement in locoregional control and a
reduction in the need for surgery (64) and that mitomycin C
increased colostomy-free and disease-free survival (63).
This regimen has become the standard of care in many
centers.  Mitomycin C is usually given as an i.v. bolus at
from 10 to 15 mg/m2 on day 1 of treatment, with a second
dose given at 6 weeks in some cases.
Although carcinoma of the esophagus is still a
relatively uncommon disease in North American, the
incidence of this disease is increasing and overall 5-year
survival rates are only 20%.  While this disease is primarily
treated by surgery many studies have demonstrated the
utility of preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy
(65,66).  Such treatment produces complete response rates
of approximately 25% for both squamous cell carcinoma
and adenocarcinoma, and may provide a slight survival
advantage (66).  The chemotherapy regimens normally
contain 5-FU with mitomycin C or cisplatin (51,65,66).
While combinations with mitomycin C or cisplatin
produced similar results (66), the latter agent is more
commonly used.
Numerous studies have shown that mitomycin C,
used as a single agent,  can produce good response rates in
a wide variety of solid tumors (43).  Thus, this agent is used
in the palliative treatment of a number of advanced cancers.
In patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer,
combinations of mitomycin C with cisplatin and vinca
alkaloids (67) or cyclophosphamide (68) produced high
response rates and a moderate increase in survival time.
Similarly, the MMM combination of mitomycin C,
mitoxantrone and methotrexate produced good response
rates in advanced breast cancer (69), which were
comparable to other regimens (70,71).  However, these
regimens have received only limited use because of their
high toxicity.
3.3.2. Clinical Studies
Although the current clinical use of mitomycin C
is limited, this agent continues to be a focus of many
clinical trials because of its intrinsic activity in many solid
tumors and its preferential activity in hypoxic cells (26).  A
number of clinical trials have used this agent as an adjunct
to radiotherapy, particularly in tumors that are routinelytreated by radiotherapy.  These trials are based on the
premise that mitomycin C may produce a synergistic effect
with radiation by acting as a radiosensitizer and by
targeting hypoxic cells in the tumor which are resistant to
radiation (26,72).  For example, two studies using
mitomycin C as an adjunct to radiation therapy in patients
with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
demonstrated a significant improvement in the local
regional relapse and recurrence-free survival for patients
receiving mitomycin C treatment (73,74).  In addition, a
study of concomitant radiotherapy with mitomycin C and
bleomycin in inoperable head and neck cancer showed that
the chemotherapy significantly increased the complete
remission rate and disease-free survival in all the patients
studied (75).  The combination treatment had an even
greater effect on the complete remission rate and disease
free-survival in patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma and
also increased the overall survival in this sub-group of
patients from 10% to 38% (75).
Similarly, radiotherapy is standard treatment for
women with locally advanced cervical cancer, but this
treatment fails to control disease progression within the
irradiated field in 40% of women (76).  Thus, there has
been interest in combining radiation with chemotherapeutic
agents that are radiosensitizers or that target hypoxic cells.
A number of studies have examined both concomitant and
neoadjuvant chemotherapy with radiotherapy in the
management of locally advanced (76,77) and advanced (78)
cervical carcinoma, using drug combinations of mitomycin
C with 5-FU and/or cisplatin.  A number of studies have
also demonstrated excellent response rates and improved
survival using combination therapy with radiation and
mitomycin C, cisplatin and vinca alkaloids in stage III non-
small-cell lung cancer (79,80).
Alternatively, mitomycin C containing
chemotherapy regimens have been studied for induction
therapy prior to surgery in a number of different types of
cancer.  For example, various combinations of mitomycin
C, 5-FU, vincristine and bleomycin have been used to
shrink locally advanced cervical cancer prior to radical
hysterectomy (81,82).  Preoperative chemotherapy  with
mitomycin C, vinca alkaloids and cisplatin in advanced
non-small-cell lung cancer produced high response rates,
high complete resection rates after response to
chemotherapy and increased survival rates (83-85).  A
recent study also demonstrated the feasibility of
preoperative chemotherapy with mitomycin C, vinblastine
and cisplatin in early stage resectable non-small-cell lung
cancer and a phase III trial has now been initiated (86).
Combinat ion chemotherapy regimens containing
mitomycin C have also been extensively studied for
treatment of a variety of resistant and recurrent cancers.  In
a small trial, mitomycin C with 5-FU and folinic acid
produced a rapid improvement in performance status and a
reduction of analgesics in approximately 80% of patients
with advanced breast cancer that had failed first- and
second-line chemotherapy (87). Mitomycin C with
methotrexate, vincristine and a steroid produced  a 30%
response rate in women with advanced breast cancer whoClinical use of quinone-containing alkylating agents
157were resistant to doxorubicin or who had relapsed after
doxorubicin treatment (88).  Mitomycin C with cisplatin
and/or doxorubicin  also produced approximately 20%
response rates in malignant mesothelioma, a disease which
has a very poor prognosis (89,90).  A 21% response rate
was seen with bleomycin, mitomycin C and cisplatin in
advanced squamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix (91)
and mitomycin C, ifosfamide and cisplatin produced a 56%
response rate in inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (92).
3.3.3. Toxicity
Although mitomycin C is an active anticancer
drug, its use in the clinic has been severely restricted by its
toxicity.  Usual dose-limiting toxicity is myelosuppression,
which occurs three to four weeks after drug administration,
with recovery within eight weeks (43).  This toxicity is
dose related, increasing with doses >10 to 20 mg/m2, but
effects are cumulative and can be unpredictable.  Generally,
thrombocytopenia or leukopenia are most severe, but
anemia is also common.  The appearance of
thrombocytopenia after mitomycin C treatment is
frequently delayed.  Other common toxicities include
anorexia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea (43).
There are a number of other less common, but
potentially serious or fatal, toxicities associated with the use of
mitomycin C.  Approximately 5% of patients receiving
mitomycin C develop severe pulmonary toxicity including
noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, interstitial pneumonitis and
pleural effusions (93) leading to progressive respiratory
insufficiency and death (43).  Corticosteroid therapy results in
improvement in the pulmonary symptoms in less severe cases
(43) and a temporary improvement in severe cases (93).  This
toxicity does not appear to be dose-related, but the risk may
increase with exposure to high oxygen concentrations or when
mitomycin C is combined with other anticancer drugs like
bleomycin which can also cause pulmonary toxicity (43).
Between 4% and 15% of patients treated with mitomycin C
develop a syndrome known by a number of different names
including cancer-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome (C-
HUS) (43,94).  This syndrome comprises a complex of
microangiopathic hemo;ytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and
renal failure that may lead to death.  The syndrome is most
common in patients that receive six to twelve months of
mitomycin therapy or total doses >60mg (43,94).  In addition,
mitomycin C extravasation during administration can cause
painful skin ulcerations and some cases of severe congestive
heart failure have been reported after mitomycin C treatment in
patients previously treated with doxorubicin (43).
3.3.4. Dosage and Drug Delivery
Mitomycin C is normally administered i.v. at a
single dose of 20 mg/m2 or at 2 mg/m2/day over 12 days;
however, other forms of drug delivery are used or have
been studied for specific tumors (43,95).  Treatment is
repeated every 6 to 8 weeks provided the leucocyte and
platelet counts have recovered sufficiently.  This dose may
be reduced if mitomycin C is combined with other
myelosuppressive agents.  The median terminal half-lives
of the drug in single-agent and combination chemotherapy
is approximately 50 and 42 minutes, respectively (43,96).
Metabolism of mitomycin C is greatest in the liver, spleenand kidney (43) with hepatic metabolism being the most
important route of elimination (43,96).  In addition,
intravesical administration of mitomycin C at doses of 20
to 40 mg is routinely used for the treatment of superficial
bladder cancer (47,56).
A number of other methods for more direct delivery
of mitomycin C to tumors have been investigated in order to
reduce the systemic toxicity of this agent.  For example,
hepatic intraarterial infusion has been used for liver metastases
from breast cancer (97) or gastrointestinal cancers (98).
A variation of this approach has involved hepatic
intraarterial administration of mitomycin C and other
chemotherapeutic agents combined with cutting off the
blood supply to hepatic tumors by embolization (99).  A
variety of methods have been used to accomplish the
vascular occlusion including the use of lipid particles or
collagen.  This procedure may prolong the transit time of
the drugs through the tumor and may also produce ischemic
damage.  Alternatively, adjuvant intraportal administration
of mitomycin C and 5-FU during surgery and during the
early postoperative period appeared to reduced the
incidence of liver metastasis and increased survival in
patients with colorectal cancer (100).  Other approaches
have included bronchial artery infusion of mitomycin C in
patients with non-small cell lung cancer (101) and direct
intratumoral injection of mitomycin C adsorbed to
activated carbon particles into pancreatic tumors (102).  In
addition, the combined use of mitomycin C and
hyperthermia has also been investigated (103).
3.4. Porfiromycin
3.4.1. Preclinical Studies
Porfiromycin was first isolated from
Streptomyces ardus  in 1960 (104) and has been shown to
have activity against many experimental tumors (105-107).
A number of significant differences have been observed
between the activity of this agent and mitomycin C.
Porfiromycin is less toxic to tumor cells than mitomycin C
under aerobic conditions (105-107), but shows similar
(105) or greater activity (106) under hypoxic conditions.
Thus, porfiromycin has a greater hypoxic:oxic ratio  and
has greater preferential toxicity to hypoxic cells than
mitomycin C.  This is likely due to poorer activation of
porfiromycin by DT-diaphorase and a greater dependence
of this agent on activation by NADPH:cytochrome P450
reductase compared with mitomycin C (108).  Other
observed differences include a greater specificity for
targeting hypoxic regions of tumors (109) and differences
in the spectra of toxic lesions produced by porfiromycin
and mitomycin C under aerobic and hypoxic conditions
(110).
Based on the greater hypoxic:oxic ratio of
porfiromycin compared with mitomycin C, porfiromycin
was studied as an adjuvant to radiotherapy.  Treatment of
EMT6 murine breast tumors in vivo  with porfiromycin and
radiation produced synergistic tumor cell kill but only
additive cytotoxicity to marrow CFU-GM (72).  In another
study, it was shown that EMT6 tumors implanted into old
mice had a higher proportion of radioresistant hypoxic cells
than tumors implanted in young mice; however, combiningClinical use of quinone-containing alkylating agents
158porfiromycin with X-rays overcame the radioresistance of
EMT6 tumors in the older mice (111).
3.4.2. Clinical Studies
Phase I clinical trials investigated the administration
of porfiromycin using multiple doses (112,113) or large
intermittent doses (112,114).  The major toxicity observed was
hematological toxicity, mainly leukopenia and
thrombocytopenia (112-114), similar to that observed with
mitomycin C (43).  These trials also produced objective
responses in patients with carcinoma of the cervix, ovary,
stomach, head and neck, and colon (114).  A number of phase II
clinical trials with porfiromycin demonstrated that this agent was
useful in disseminated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix
and also showed activity in carcinomas of the lung and head and
neck (115).  A study comparing the effectiveness of
porfiromycin and mitomycin C found that these agents produced
comparable results in patients with colorectal carcinoma,
gastrointestinal cancer and ovarian cancer (116).
Based on the laborator y studies combining
porfiromycin with radiation, porfiromycin in combination with
radiation therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
neck was studied in a phase I clinical trial (117).  Patients with
locally advanced disease and a low probability of cure were
treated with standard fractionated daily radiation, and
porfiromycin was administered on days 5 and 47 of the course
of radiation therapy.  This treatment regimen resulted in
acceptable acute hematological and nonhematological
toxicities, and produced a 5 year disease free survival rate of
32%.  Based on these results a phase III trial comparing
porforomycin and radiation therapy with radiation therapy
alone in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck has
been initiated.
3.5. Other Mitomycin Analogues
3.5.1. Preclinical Studies
While both mitomycin C and porfiromycin have
very good antitumor activity in a variety of solid tumors,
their clinical use has been limited by cumulative
myelosuppression and C-HUS.  Thus, there has been
considerable interest in developing mitomycin analogues
with decreased toxicity and increased antitumor activity.
Most studies have focussed on substitutions at the C7
amino group of mitomycin C or porfiromycin (118).
Although many mitomycin analogues have been prepared
and have been tested for antitumor activity, only a small
number of these compounds have been targeted for further
development.
The 7- N-(dimethylamino methylene) analogue of
mitomycin C, BMY-25282, was more potent in a number
of different mouse tumors in vitro and in vivo , showed
greater activity under aerobic conditions and generated
more oxygen radicals than the parent compound (119,120).
This agent had a lower quinone-containing reduction
potential than mitomycin C (121), and was active in human
colon carcinoma cells that were resistant to the parent drug
because of deficient activation of mitomycin C (122).
However, BMY-25282 showed greater toxicity to neonatal
rat-heart myocytes than mitomycin C (123) and produceddelayed cardiac toxicity in rats in vivo  (124).  Thus, this
agent was not tested in humans.
M83, a 7- N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) analogue of
mitomycin C, showed greater potency than the parent drug
against a number of rodent leukemia, lymphoma and solid
tumors in vivo (125).  This agent also produced lower
myelosuppression and leukopenia than mitomycin C and
had a markedly increased therapeutic index in these rodent
models (125).  In contrast, M83 showed similar activitity to
mitomycin C in human tumor xenografts (126).  However,
based on the lower toxicity in the rodent model, M83 was
tested in a phase I-II clinical study (127).
The 7- N-(2-(4-nitrophenyldithio)ethyl) analogue
of mitomycin C, BMS-181174 (formerly known as BMY-
25067), was shown to have superior activity against solid
tumors in mice compared to mitomycin C (128).  In
addition, this agent was less neutropenic and
thrombocytopenic than mitomycin C (128), and produced
only minor renal changes with no cardiac or pulmonary
toxicity in animals (124).  BMS-181174 was more potent
under aerobic conditions than under hypoxia and may
produce its cytotoxic effects by a different mechanism than
the parent compound (129,130).  Based on these
considerations BMS-181174 was evaluated in a phase I
trial (131).

ethyl)dithio)ethyl)mitomycin C (also known as KT6149) is
a water soluble mitomycin analogue (132) that showed
enhanced antitumor activity against human tumors in vitro
(133) and in nude mice (134).  The mechanism of
antitumor activity of this analogue may be similar to that of
BMS-181174 (130).  KW2149 has not yet been tested in
the clinic.
3.5.2. Clinical Studies
To date only M83 and BMS-181174 have been
studied in the clinic.  A phase I-II study of M83 in 22
patients found that this analogue produced hematological
and non-hematological toxicities that were very similar to
those seen with mitomycin C and only one objective
response was observed (127).  Based on this initial study it
was suggested that this agent was not superior to the parent
drug and no further clinical studies were carried out.  A
phase I trial with BMS-181174 found that
myelosuppression, particularly thrombocytopenia, was the
dose limiting toxicity (131).  Other toxicities included
thrombophlebitis, pneumonitis and possible cardiotoxicity
and renal damage.  Although this agent showed antitumor
activity in previously treated and untreated patients, no
further clinical studies are planned.

agents studied as possible anticancer drugs.  Putter (7)
suggested that adding alkylating groups to the
benzoquinone structure would produce compounds with
potent antitumor activity
Holzer et al (1) provided support for this suggestion by
demonstrating that a number of aziridinyl benzoquinones
had very good antitumor activity.  This lead to the synthesis
and testing of a large number of benzoquinone analogues
having differing alkylating groups (14-16).  The majority of
these analogues had either an aziridine (1,14-16) or
nitrogen mustard (14) alkylating group; however, a variety
of other alkylating groups were also investigated
(14,15,20).  While some of these agents showed good
activity in  tumor cells or animal models many of them also
produced major toxicities, particularly hematological
toxicity (14).  To date only four benzoquinone-containing
alkylating agents, diaziquone (AZQ), carbazilquinone,
triaziquone and BZQ, have been used in the clinic,
although other agents such as RH1 (135) have received
considerable attention recently (Figure 2).
4.2. Diaziquone
4.2.1. Preclinical Studies
Diaziquone was first tested as a potential central
nervous system antitumor agent in the early 1960's and was
shown to have significant activity in both intracerebral and
intraperitoneal mouse leukemia models, as well as activity
in solid tumors (136,137).  The mechanism of action of
diaziquone is still not fully understood but appears to result
from DNA alkylation, crosslinking and strand break
formation (138).  Studies by Gutierrez et al (139) have
shown that this agent is reduced by NADPH:cytochrome
P450 reductase to the semiquinone species which generates
reactive oxygen species by redox cycling in the presence of
oxygen.  However, diaziquone has also been shown to be a
substrate for DT-diaphorase (140,141), and reduction of the
quinone by this enzyme resulted in increased DNA
crosslinking, oxygen radical formation and cytotoxicity
(140-142).  It is still not clear which of the two activation
pathways and which types of DNA damage are most
important for the antitumor activity of this agent (140,141).
4.2.2. Clinical Studies
Phase I studies investigated the use of diaziquone
by daily (143) or weekly (144) i.v. injection, by monthlyintraarterial infusion (145) or by twice-weekly or weekly
intrathecal injection (146).  The dose limiting toxicities
were generally leukopenia and thrombocytopenia (143-
145), while gastrointestinal toxicity (144,145) and
headache (146) were also common.  Diaziquone was
rapidly removed from plasma by a two-compartment open-
system model (143,144), and the agent was found at
appreciable levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (146,147).  A
number of complete and partial responses were seen in
patients with meningeal leukemia (146) and malignant
astrocytomas (145).
Based on preclinical studies and phase I clinical
trials, diaziquone has been studied in the treatment of CNS
tumors.  A number of clinical trials showed response rates
of approximately 20% in patients with high-grade or
progressive gliomas treated with diaziquone (148,149) and
approximately 25% in patients with astrocytic neoplasms
treated with diaziquone and either BCNU or procarbazine
(150).  However, phase III trials comparing diaziquone to
the nitrosoureas, BCNU or PCNU, found that diaziquone
was not significantly better than BCNU (151) and was less
effective than PCNU (152) in patients with brain tumors.
The activity of diaziquone in a wide variety of
leukemias, lymphomas and solid tumors has been
extensively studied.  This agent produced responses in 30%
of patients with relapsed acute nonlymphocytic leukemia
(153,154) and in 20% of patients with refractory lymphoma
(155,156) or acute myeloid leukemia (157).  In contrast, the
drug was not active in patients with resistant multiple
myeloma (158,159).  Diaziquone produced only minor
responses in patients with head and neck (160), ovarian
(161), lung (162,163), colorectal (164,165), breast (166),
cervical (167), uterine (168), gastric (169), pancreatic (170)
and renal (171) cancer, and was inactive in soft tissue and
bony sarcomas (172) and melanomas (173).  Diaziquone
has also been extensively evaluated in pediatric tumors.  It
produced a 10% response rate in recurrent pediatric brain
tumors (174,175), but had little effect in other solid tumors
(174) or acute leukemias (176).  In addition, because
diaziquone shows little non-hematopoietic toxicity, it has
been investigated for inclusion into bone marrow transplant
preparative regimens (177).
Despite showing good activity in recurrent or
resistant brain tumors, nonlymphocytic leukemias andClinical use of quinone-containing alkylating agents
160lymphomas, diaziquone is not currently in general use.
This is likely due to its toxicity and because it did not
demonstrate clearly superior effectiveness to existing or
newer chemotherapeutic agents.
4.3 Carbazilquinone
4.3.1 Preclinical Studies
Carbazilquinone was first synthesized in 1970 as
a mitomycin C analogue having a quinone group and
aziridine and carbamate alkylating groups (178).   This
agent showed good activity in mouse tumors in vivo
including plasmacytoma, lymphoid leukemia and Ehrlich
carcinoma, and was more effective than mitomycin C in the
latter two tumors (179).  It also showed good antitumor
activity in human primary tumor specimens of urothelial
transitional-cell  carcinoma  (180), lung cancer (181),
hepatocellular carcinoma (182), squamous cell carcinoma
(183) and gastric cancer (184) in vitro , and in human
ovarian (185) and pancreatic (186) tumor xenografts in
nude mice.   The mechanism of action of carbazilquinone is
not completely understood, but it is thought that this agent
acts as an alkylating agent (187).  The drug is a substrate
for both NADH (188) and NADPH-dependent (189)
reductive enzymes; generates reactive oxygen species
(189); produces DNA strand breaks (190), and is more
active under hypoxic conditions (191).   Thus,
carbazilquinone is likely a bioreductive agent and
production of DNA strand breaks through the generation of
reactive oxygen species may also contribute to its antitumor
activity.
4.3.2 Clinical Studies
Carbazilquinone has been extensively studied in
the clinic, primarily in Japan, since the 1970s.  Initial
studies suggested that this agent had activity as a single
agent in gastric, ovarian and  hematological cancers (187).
Later studies found response rates of from 6% to 30% in
lung tumors (192-194), 60% in gastric tumors (195,196)
and 40% in ovarian tumors (197)when the agent was
combined with other antitumor agents or immunotherapy.
Carbazilquinone also produced a 60% response rate when
used with doxorubicin and bleomycin in patients with
superficial bladder cancer (198), but lower response rates
were seen with doxorubicin, mitomycin C, cisplatin or 5-
FU in prostate (199) or liver cancer (200).   However, this
agent appeared to be highly effective in patients with
hematological disorders including chronic myelogenous
leukemia, lymphomas, multiple myeloma, polycythemia
vera and essential thrombocythemia (201-203).
Initial studies indicated that carb azilquinone
produced the usual toxicities associated with mitomycin C
analogues.  Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and anorexia
were the major toxic effects of the drug, but there was no
evidence of toxicity to the liver or kidneys (187).
However, more recent studies suggest that this agent may
promote transformation of some myeloproliferative
disorders to acute leukemias (203).  In a controlled study
17% of patients with polycythemia vera and 31% of
patients with essential thrombocythemia that were treated
with carbazilquinone had transformations to acute leukemia
and there appeared to be a relationship between the dose ofdrug received and transformation (203).  Thus, there has
been little use of this agent in North America or Europe.
4.4 Other Benzoquinone-containing Alkylating Agents
4.4.1 Preclinical Studies
Triaziquone was first synthesized in 1958 (204)
and was shown to have activity in a variety of different
animal tumors in vitro  and in vivo  and in human tumors
including Jensen sarcoma (205), Ehrlich mouse carcinomas
and GW77  human colon carcinoms (206) and rat Yoshida
sarcoma (207).  This agent presumably produces its
antitumor effects by alkylation of cellular components
(208), and has been shown to inhibit DNA and RNA
synthesis (209,210).  Triaziquone may block synthesis of
deoxynucleotide bases (209) and interacts with the plasma
membrane (211).  More recent studies suggest that this
agent is a substrate for both one and two-electron reducing
agents and that the cytotoxic activity may result from
protein alkylation and oxidative stress (212,213).
BZQ was first synthesized in 1976 (137) and
showed good activity against intraperitoneal mouse
leukemias and melanoma (214).  This agent had only
moderate activity in an intracerebral mouse model (214),
but showed good activity in human colon carcinoma (215)
and human leukemia cells (216) in vitro .  Mechanistic
studies suggested that BZQ was not a substrate for DT-
diaphorase (215) and did not produce DNA strand breaks
(217).  However, it produced DNA crosslinking without
reduction and this was enhanced under acidic conditions
(218).  Thus, the cytotoxicity of this agent appeared to be
due to its alkylating activity, and the drug probably does
not act as a bioreductive agent (219).
4.4.2 Clinical Studies and Use
Triaziquone was used clinically in the 1960s for
the treatment of a number of cancers (220).  It was used
intravenously in the treatment of leukemias and lymphomas
like chronic lymphocytic leukemia and Hodgkin’s disease,
and for ovarian cancer.  The agent was also used as an
ointment for basal cell skin cancers.  Because of its toxicity
to bone marrow and blood vessel walls it has been replaced
by more effective agents and has not been used clinically
for many years.  A more recent  study of this agent as an
adjuvant to surgery in carcinoma of the cervix found that
there was no difference in 5 year survival between the
triaziquone treated patients and patients receiving
conventional therapy (221).
BZQ has received only minimal investigation in
humans.  A pharmacokinetic study showed that, like
diaziquone, this agent was rapidly removed from the
plasma but had much lower plasma protein binding than
diaziquone (222).
5. CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF
INDOLOQUINONE-CONTAINING ALKYLATING
AGENTS
5.1. History
Following the isolation of mitomycin C and its
identification as a potent antibiotic and antitumor agent,Clinical use of quinone-containing alkylating agents
161                        
Figure 3.  Structure of EO9
there was considerable interest in developing simpler
synthetic analogues.  Because the mitomycin structure
contains the indoloquinone ring system, indoloquinone
analogues were synthesized and tested for their biological
activity (223).  While many of these compounds
demonstrated antibiotic activity, most did not show good
antitumor activity (223).  There was renewed interest in the
indoloquinones as antitumor agents in the 1980s with new
analogues being prepared (224,225) and tested for
biological activity.  This interest has continued to the
present time with many structure-activity studies aimed at
identifying new bioreductive agents being reported (226-
229).   However, to date only one indoloquinone, EO9, has
been tested in the clinic (Figure 3).
5.2. EO9
5.2.1. Preclinical Studies
EO9 was synthesized in 1987 (225) and its
antitumor activity has been extensively studied in animal
and human tumors (230).  EO9 showed very good
antitumor activity in many human tumor cell lines in vitro
and displayed preferential activity in cell lines derived from
solid tumors in the NCI human tumor screen, particularly
colon, melanoma, central nervous system, renal and non-
small cell lung tumors (230,231).  This agent was also very
potent in a number of in vivo murine tumors and human
tumor xenografts, but showed little activity in leukemias
(231).  In addition, EO9 produced no significant bone
marrow toxicity in mice.  However, preclinical studies in
animals found that the drug was rapidly eliminated (232).
The mechanism of action of EO9 has also been
extensively studied.  The agent is reduced by both one and
two-electron reducing enzymes (233-235) and produces
DNA strand breaks (234) and crosslinks (233,235)
following reduction.  The two-electron reducing enzyme,
DT-diaphorase, appears to be the most important activating
enzyme for EO9 under aerobic conditions, and the
sensitivity of cells to this agent correlated with the level of
the enzyme under these conditions (236,237).  EO9 showed
enhanced activity under hypoxic conditions; however, DT-
diaphorase appeared to decrease the activity of the agent
under these conditions (238).
5.2.2. Clinical Studies
Based on the selective activity of EO9 toward
solid tumors, its preferential toxicity to hypoxic cells and
its low marrow toxicity, this agent was entered into clinical
trials.  Two phase I studies found that the drug was rapidly
eliminated from the plasma following intravenous
injection, but did not produce any bone marrow
suppression (239, 240).  The dose-limiting toxicity was
proteinurea  (239).  Phase II clinical trials with EO9
confirmed the renal toxicity and lack of myelosuppressionwith the drug; however, the agent showed no antitumor
activity in breast, gastric, pancreatic, colorectal or non-
small cell lung cancer (241, 242).  This failure has
primarily been attributed to the rapid clearance of the agent
from the body.
