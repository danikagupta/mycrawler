abstract
Bathroom greywater represent the major portion of the total greywater production from the house-
hold activity. These wastes should be subjected to a treatment process before being discharged 
directly into the environment to avoid the occurrence of the eutrophication phenomenon. Hence, the current work aimed to investigate the potential of phycoremediation process for removing 
nutrients from artificial bathroom greywater (ABGW) by Botryococcus sp. The phycoremedia-
tion process was conducted for 30 d, while the microalgae cell growth in ABGW was measured 
daily. The biokinetic absorption using Michaelis–Menten were determined for NO
3–N and PO4–P. 
The results revealed that the maximum microalgae cell growth was recorded on the 10th day with 
2.0 × 106 cells/mL. The highest removal of NO3–N (97%) and PO4–P (87%) were achieved on the 30th 
day of phycoremediation. The biokinetic absorption rate using Michaelis–Menten coefficient were 
K = 0.265 mg NO3–N mg/Chl-a/d and Km = 2.38 mg/L, while for PO4–P were K = 1.057 mg PO4–P mg/
Chl-a/d and Km = 12.04 mg/L. In conclusion, phycoremediation using Botryococcus sp. exhibited a 
high potential for the nutrients removal from ABGW.

1. Introduction
Bathroom greywater is a type of wastewater derived 
from the hand basin, shower, bath, and laundry water 
and represent 30% of household greywater flow [1]. These wastes are rich with the nutrients which lead to cause eutrophication phenomenon in the natural water system after the discharge process. The nutrients in the greywater are originated from the chemical substances used during the bathing. Besides, some references indicated that the nutrients also originate from the urine passed during the showers [2]. Therefore, the removal of nutrients and organic contents is an essential step to avert eutrophication and water bloom [3].
Numerous systems operated for the removal of nutri-
ents from greywater and other pollutions. However, these techniques are expensive and generate elevated thick soft mud [4–6]. Natural treatment systems via primary set-tling with cascaded water flow, aeration, agitation, and filtration [7,8] are less expensive. Yet, there is a lack of information when it concerns the removal of nutrients espe-cially phycoremediation with microalgae Botryococcus sp.  339 A. Wurochekke et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 216 (2021) 338–343
Greywater management treatment system is a system that 
allows direct utilization of the water. It can use natural grav-
ity by a hybrid treatment process with the use of natural 
materials and wetland system. It will facilitate in breaking 
down the organic compounds and recovery of nutrients [9].
Among several treatment processes for removing nutri-
ents, microalgae through the phycoremediation process is the most potent due to their capacity to assimilate nutri-
ents. Phycoremediation is an attractive method because 
of their photosynthetic capabilities, changing solar energy into handy biomasses and embracing nutrients such as 
nitrogen and phosphorus which inflicts eutrophication [9]. 
Phycoremediation process is a green technique used for 
removing nutrients from different wastewater as a func-
tion of microalgae such as Botryococcus sp. Due to the high 
efficiency of microalgae to assimilate nutrients. Domestic 
greywater is among different wastewater which is more 
suitable medium for algal growth due to high content of 
carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus as well as trace elements 
necessary for their growth. Nitrogen and phosphorus are among the most important nutrients in the greywater and 
are presented in concentrations ranged between 20 and 
40 mg/L for total nitrogen and 50 and 70 mg/L for total 
phosphorus (TP) which lie in the appropriate range for 
microalgae growth. The source of phosphorus in bath-room greywater is the soap and detergent content used 
by house occupants [7,9]. The phycoremediation with 
microalgae is a really acceptable method because of their 
photosynthetic capabilities, changing solar energy into bio-masses yields, and embracing phosphorus and nitrogen contents which inflicts eutrophication [9].
In the current work, the removal of nutrients from arti-
ficial bathroom greywater (ABGW) by phycoremediation using Botryococcus sp. was investigated. Moreover, the 
specific removal rate of the nutrients by Botryococcus sp. 
was studied using Michaelis–Menten kinetic model.
2. Materials and methods
The ABGW with commonly used in the present study 
was prepared according to Wurochekke (Table 1) [2]. 
Botryococcus sp. was selected in this study based on the pre-vious studies which exhibited high efficiency for remov-ing nutrients from meat processing wastewater [10]. The microalgae was sub-cultured in bolts basal medium (BBM) as described by Bischoff and Bold [11]. The medium was incubated at room temperature (25°C–29°C) for 7 d (12 h 
L:12 h D period with 18–20 MJ/m
2/d of solar irradiance). 
The microalgae cell biomass was recovered from the culture medium using a centrifuge (4,020 rcf) washed twice using 
sterilized deionized water to remove the residues and then suspended in 10 mL of sterilized normal saline. The concen-
trations of microalgae cells were determined using hemocy-tometer according to APHA [12] and expressed as cell/mL.
2.1. Phycoremediation of ABGW
In order to investigate the efficiency of Botryococcus sp. 
in removing nutrients from ABGW samples, the phycore-
mediation of ABGW was conducted in Erlenmeyer flasks 
(1 L). The ABGW were diluted with distilled water by 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% and then each dilution was inoculated with 10
6 cells/mL of Botryococcus sp. cells (each 
experiment was conducted in triplicate at a different time). The ABGW sample (without microalgae inoculation) was used as control. The inoculated ABGW samples were cov-ered with sterile cotton plugs immediately after the inoc-ulation and placed under the direction of sunlight (12 h 
light and 12 h dark) at the ambient temperature for 30 d.
The concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) and total 
phosphorus (TP) were carried out for each sample at the periods of 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, and 30 d. A fixed 
volume (100 mL) from each dilution was transferred from 
the ABGW and used for determining the final concentra-tions of TN and TP according to APHA [13]. The efficiency of Botryococcus sp. in removing TN and TP from ABGW 
was calculated according to Eq. (1).

2.2. Biokinetic absorption rate of microalgae Botryococcus sp.
In this study, ABGW inoculated with microalgae 
Botryococcus sp. was used in determining biokinetic coef-
ficients, K
m saturation constant and reaction rate constant 
K using Michaelis–Menten kinetic relationship in Eq. (2) 
[14]. From the experimental data a plot of 1

strate removal, and S is initial substrate concentration.
The Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) was determined using 
spectrophotometer (HACH DR 6000, United States) at 
a wavelength of 664, and 647 according to Jeffrey and Humphrey [15] using the following formula:

cells, since the counting of microalgae was conducted by the light microscope which cannot detect the live and dead cells.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Nutrient (nitrate-N and phosphate-P) removal by 
Botryococcus sp. from ABGW
The phycoremediation of ABGW using Botryococcus  
sp. with the different initial of nitrate-N (NO
3–N) concen-
trations against time for 30 d of batch operation is shown 
in Figs. 1a and b. The NO3–N was removed by 96% and 
97% from the ABGW at 2.3 and 1.2 mg/L of initial con-
centrations in 40% and 20% of ABGW dilution. Similarly, 
NO3–N the removal efficiency was 95% at 4.65 and 
3.32 mg/L in 80% and 60% of ABGW dilution respectively. 
However, the removal efficiency further decreased to 78% at 4.99 mg/L in 100% ABGW dilution.
The final phosphate-P concentration was 1.22 mg/L 
with 87% of the removal efficiency at 9.5 mg/L of the ini-
tial concentrations in 20% ABGW. In the 100% ABGW, the removal efficiency dropped to 73% (Figs. 2a and b). The results revealed that the efficiency of Botryococcus sp.  for removing nitrate-N was more than for removing phosphate-P.
The Chl-a content increased (from 0.8 to 6.1 mg/L) sig-
nificantly (P < 0.05) with the increasing of NO
3–N concen-
trations and associated with Botryococcus  sp. growth (Fig. 3). 
This shows the sign of Botryococcus  sp. growth in ABGW. 
The increasing Chl-a in ABGW indicated for the efficiency 
of phycoremediation process in removing nutrients [16].
These results are consistent with the previous studies, 
Valderrama et al. [17] revealed that Chlorella vulgaris 
removed 72% of TN and 28% of TP from the diluted eth-anol and citric acid production effluent, while removed 
80% from the high rate algal ponds (HRAP) after 7 d 
[18]. The researchers in the literature indicated that the 
microalgae have less affinity to remove phosphate-P in comparison to nitrate-N. Lee and Lee [19] found that Chlorella kessleri removed between 8% and 20% of phos-
phorus. However, the experimental data obtained in this 
study revealed that phosphate-P was better removed for 
80% ABGW (dropped from 13.5 to 3.19 mg/L in 30 d). Aslan 
and Kapdan [14] recorded 78% of phosphate-P removal from synthetic wastewater.
3.2. Biokinetic coefficients, nitrate-N, and phosphate-P specific 
removal rate and yield coefficients from ABGW
The specific removal rate of NO
3–N with varying 
NO3–N concentrations is depicted in Fig. 4. The removal

age of nitrate-N from ABGW.
Fig. 2. (a) Final concentrations of phosphate-P in ABGW and (b) removal percentage.341 A. Wurochekke et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 216 (2021) 338–343
rate increased by increasing in the initial NO3–N concen-
trations. The maximum rate reached was 0.22 mg/mg Chl-
a/d in the concentration from 1.2 to 5 mg/L. The specific 
PO4–P removal rate increased from 0.02 mg/mg Chl-a/ d 
to around 0.64 mg/mg Chl-a/ d for the PO4–P concentra-
tions between 9.5 and 14.16 mg/L (Fig. 5). The substrate 
(nutrient) removal rates were reported in previous studies 
instead of specific removal rates.
The maximum values attained in Aslan and Kapdan 
[14] study were 3.0 mg/mg Chl-a/L/d and 0.52 mg/mg Chl-
a/d for NH4–N and PO4–P using C. vulgaris. In another 
study, the nitrogen and phosphorus removal rates by C. vulgaris were 5.44 and 1.30 mg/L d, respectively [20]. 
Wong and Tam [21] reported that the removal rates of Chlorella pyrenoidosa as 3.4 mg N/L d and 10.7 mg P/L d. 
However, significantly higher removal rates of 20.83 mg 
P/L d and 83 mg N/L d for suspended growth culture of 
Scenedesmus intermedius and 10.15 mg P/L d and 56.06 mg 
N/L d for Nannochloris sp. were reported by Martínez et al. 
[22]. However, the disparity in the result of this study and previous studies could be due to differences in wastewa-ter strain, there is high pollution in wastewater compared to greywater as well as different microalgae species used.From the linear lineweaver–Burke plot transformed in 
Eq. (2), the plot between 1/R

NO N− and 
41
OP P− is 
shown in Figs. 6 and 7. The equations of the straight line for 
the slope and intercept 1andmK
KK

 were determined. The 
kinetic coefficients for NO3–N removal in ABGW and uptake  
(Fig. 6) by Botryococcus sp. were determined as a reaction 
rate constant (K ) of 0.256 mg NO3–N mg/Chl-a/d and a 
saturated constant (Km) of 2.38 mg/L (R2 = 0.83). Similarly, 
experimental data from PO4–P removal rate (Fig. 7) from 
the best fit regression line were determined as a reaction 
rate constant (K ) of 1.057 mg PO4–P mg/Chl-a/d and satu-
ration constant (Km) of 12.04 mg/L from the intercept and 
the slope (R2 = 0.94). Therefore, the NO3–N and PO4–P sub-
strate removal rates in this study were in line with those reported by Aslan and Kapdan [16]. Thus, the low value of K
m in NO3–N over PO4–P means the enzyme has a high 
affinity with the substrate. Hence, if Km is small, enzymes 
will reach the maximum catalytic efficiency at low sub-strate levels. This means optimum nutrient removal or uptake by Botryococcus sp. occurs in low strain greywater.
For all NO
3–N and PO4–P removal, the plot of Chl-a 
produced against substrate depleted is shown in Figs. 8 and 9. The slope gives a yield coefficient for NO
3–N (YN) 
and PO4–P (YP). The calculated YN was 0.36 mg Chl-a/mg 
NO3–N (R2 = 0.8358) and the YP was 1.18 mg Chl-a/mg 
PO4–P (R2 = 0.0954). The coefficient (R2) is located between 
80% and 90% not very close to 100, might be due to the distribution of the raw data.
The kinetics of the nutrient uptake model is different 
from other models that are basically on an exponential growth phase. A kinetic nutrient uptake model is derived using the same data, but focuses on nutrient uptake rates. The kinetic coefficients K and K
m in this study were calcu-
lated from the overall uptake measurement that reflects the substrate carrier ability of Botryococcus sp. Thus, it 
demonstrated that NO
3–N and PO4–P uptake by Botryococcus  
sp. can be described using Michaelis–Menten kinetics [14].  01234567

Furthermore, Michaelis–Menten kinetics was used to des-
cribe nitrate in higher plants like rice [22].
The present study established an uptake relationship 
with NO3–N, the reaction rate constant K  of 0.46 mg/Chl-
a/d and a saturation constant or maximum uptake rate or Michaelis–Menten constant K
m of 5.75 mg/L. The uptake rates 
of PO4–P are K of 8.53 mg/Chl-a/d and Km of 176.88 mg/L. It 
is paramount to note that this model demonstrated a nutri-ent limited uptake rate and not a nutrient limited growth rate. In addition, Aslan and Kapdan [14] reported a K of 
1.5 mg NH
4–N mg Chl-a/d, Km of 31.5 mg/L and K of 0.5 mg 
PO4–P mg Chl-a/d and Km of 10.5 mg/L. These reported 
results are different from the results of this study due to sub-
strate difference as ABGW was used in this study. Fiksen et 
al. [23] stated that a higher Km value is associated with an 
increase in competitive ability for nutrient concentration. The microalgae Botryococcus  sp. need to adapt to the com-
position of bathroom greywater during the phycoremedia-tion process. Thus, the competitive ability of Botryococcus  
sp. in ABGW might be lower during the early stages of inoculation but will later increase at an exponential rate thereby increasing the uptake of nutrients. This exponen-tial growth is due to the proliferation of the microalgae cells and its size. In this case, microalgae cell size is associated with an increase in K
m value [24]. This would create more 
uptake sites thereby increasing the rate of nutrient uptake. From this study, the K
m values were relatively high for both 
NO3–N and PO4–P possibly due to Botryococcus sp.’s com-
petitive ability with respect to cell size. This implies that Botryococcus sp. are better competitors with a good uptake rate (K). Therefore, the model developed from this study 
is a representation of complex interacting components. The selection of algal species, interspecies differentiation, bioreactor size, type, and media composition of greywa-ter, light source, temperature, pH, and CO
2 concentration 
will all have an effect on the maximum uptake rate and 
reaction rate constant developed for nitrate-N and phos-
phates-P above. Hence, if Chl-a and substrate concentra-tions were measured, the calculation steps outlined in the results can be easily applied to a larger scale.

PO4–P coefficients were K = 1.057 mg PO4–P mg/Chl-a/d 
and Km = 12.04 mg/L (R2 = 0.94). According to these results, 
it proves the potentiality of microalgae Botryococcus sp. as 
a successful technique to eliminate nutrients in bathroom 
greywater. Moreover, in order to explain the efficiency of Botryococcus sp. in removing the nutrients the removal 
mechanism should be investigated.
