Abstract
Using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) we evaluated the culture conditions 
(nitrogen source, carbon source, pH and agitation rate) that increase the biomass 
of  Acidocella facilis  strain USBA-GBX-505 and therefore enhance the production of  
its lipolytic enzyme, 505 LIP . RSM results revealed that yeast extract and agitation 
were key culture factors that increased the growth-associated lipolytic activity by 
4.5-fold (from 0.13 U.mg-1 to 0.6 U.mg-1). The 505 LIP lipase was partially purified 
using size-exclusion chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography. Its 
molecular weight was >77 kDa. The enzyme shows its optimum catalytic activity 
at 55 °C and pH 7.5. EDTA, PMSF, 1-butanol and DMSO inhibited enzymatic 
activity, whereas Tween 20, acetone, glycerol and methanol increased it. Metallic 
ions are not required for the activity of  505 LIP , and even have an inhibitory 
effect on the enzyme. This study shows the potential use of  A. facilis  strain USBA-
GBX-505 for the production of  a newly identified lipolytic enzyme, 505 LIP , which 
is stable at moderate temperatures and in the presence of  organic solvents. These 
are important characteristics for the synthesis of  many useful products.

Introduction
Currently, 75 % of  the enzymes used on an industrial scale are hydrolytic enzymes, 
with the carbohydrolases, proteases and lipases dominating the enzyme market [1]. 
Lipases (EC 3.1.1.1) and esterases (EC 3.1.1.3) belong to the family of  α/β hydrolases, 
which are characterized by their capacity to hydrolyse and to form ester bonds 
in organic molecules, such as lipids and fats [ 1-3]. These enzymes are industrially 
important due to their capacity to act in environments with a low concentration 
of  water, allowing them to perform esterification, transesterification, aminolytic 
and acidolytic reactions [ 4] with high efficiency and stability. The lipases are able to Response Surface Methodology (RSM) for analysing

catalyse enzymatic reactions with efficiency, stability and chemo-, region- and enantio-
selectivity, as well as not requiring cofactors and high activity levels in organic solvents 
make them versatile biocatalysers for industrial purposes [ 5], including food, dairy, 
agrochemical, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and detergent production [ 5, 6] due to their 
unique properties, associated with their broad substrate range [ 7]. 
By 2017, the industrial demand for lipolytic enzymes will rise 6.2% [ 5], which means 
that it is necessary to continue to research and develop technology relating to them. 
Many of  the lipolytic enzymes have poor stability during industrial processes, are 
denatured at high temperatures or extreme pH (alkaline or acid) and tend to lose 
activity over time at room temperature, resulting in inefficient catalysts. The industrial 
demand for lipolytic enzymes that are active at moderate and high temperatures and 
extreme pH has particularly encouraged the search for extremophilic microorganisms 
as source of  thermostable enzymes [ 8-10]. Extremophilic microorganisms are 
the best source of  extremozymes that catalyse reactions at extreme temperatures, 
extreme pH (acidic or alkaline pH), in the presence of  solvents, high salinity, high 
radiation levels, low water activity or high concentrations of  metals, among other 
environmental conditions [ 11]. However, some of  these organisms exhibit slow and 
scarce growth, hindering the production of  enzymes and therefore their subsequent 
purification and application. Identifying the culture variables that optimize the growth 
of  the organisms that produce the enzymes is an important step in their production 
[12, 13] .To improve the microbial enzymatic production, it is necessary to consider 
several factors such as nutrients (sources of  carbon and nitrogen), metal ions, pH, 
temperature, inoculum volume, among others [ 14].
The microbial communities of  acidic environments are characterized by having 
very diverse and active metabolisms [ 15], mainly autotrophic and/or mixotrophic. 
These microorganisms produce active metabolites, including sesquiterpenoids, 
polyketide-terpenoid metabolites, berkeleydione, and berkeleytrione [ 16, 17]. They 
also produce stable extremozymes in conditions of  extreme temperature and pH 
and are tolerant to solvents and detergents. Therefore, the search for extremozymes 
produced by acidophilic microorganisms represents a major challenge, and the 
exploration of  pristine habitats offers possibilities to find enzymes with previously 
unreported features. The acidophilic organisms have been investigated not only 
for possible connections to ancient organisms but also for particular physical, 
structural, and molecular properties that allow them to live in acidic environments 
[18, 19]. During our previous studies on microbial diversity of  acid hot springs in Los 
Nevados National Natural Park (Los Nevados NNP), we isolated several thermo and 
mesophilic acidophilic organisms with lipolytic activity tested on different substrates.
We evaluated the strain USBA-GBX-505 (CMPUJ U505 Acidocella, WDCM857), 
previously isolated from the acidic hot spring “El Coquito”(A4) (Los Nevados NNP) 
located at 3,973 m.a.s.l (4º 52’ 41.99” N; 75º 16’ 23.41” W) [ 20], as a source of  lipolytic 
enzymes because our previous studies demonstrated that it is capable of  hydrolyzing 
lipid substrates at ~55 ºC. Additionally, we observed the highest lipolytic activity in the 
intracellular fraction compared to the extracellular fraction, but the strain exhibited 
a slow growth rate. In the present study we identified the growth factors of  A. facilis  
strain USBA-GBX-505 that allow a higher production of  biomass, which facilitated the 
partial purification and biochemical characterization of  the lipolytic enzyme 505 LIP . Funding:  This research was carried out

Materials and Methods 
Microorganism and culture conditions
The acidophilic strain USBA-GBX-505 [ 20] was cultured in modified basal salt 
medium 991 (M991) [ 21] containing the following: (g.L-1) (NH 4)2SO 4 1.3, KH 2PO 4 
0.28, MgSO 4 •7H 2O 0.25, CaCl 2 • 2H 2O 0.07, and FeSO 4 0.02, supplemented with  
1 g.L-1 yeast extract, 5 g.L-1 peptone and 10 ml.L-1 trace element solution SL-10 [ 22]. 
The pH was adjusted to 3.5 by using 5 N H 2SO 4. The microorganism was incubated at 
30 ºC with agitation at 200 r/min. The inoculum used for all assays was standardized 
at an absorbance of  0.3 - 0.4 at 580 nm, corresponding to a concentration of  ~4 x 108 
CFU.mL-1, obtained during the mid-exponential phase of  growth (48 hours). 
Extraction of  intracellular proteins
The biomass was concentrated by centrifugation at 8,000 g for 20 min at 10 ºC. The 
cells were washed twice with Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5). Then, the biomass was 
resuspended in the same buffer with 200 μg.mL-1 of  lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich, U.S.A.), 
and the mixture was incubated at 37 ºC for 10 min and placed on ice for 30 min. Cell 
lysis was performed through sonication using a QSonica Q125 sonicator (Qsonica, 
Newtown, CT, U.S.A.), in 15 cycles of  30 s sonication pulses at 30% amplitude and  
30 s breaks at 0 ºC. Finally, the lysate was centrifuged at 8,000 g for 25 min at 4 ºC, and 
the supernatant was considered to be the intracellular protein extract [ 20].
Evaluation of  the intracellular lipolytic activity using p-nitrophenyl ester (pNP-ester) 
The lipolytic activity was measured spectrophotometrically using the pNP- decanoate 
(pNP-C10) as a substrate. The enzymatic reaction was performed under the following 
conditions: 425 µl of  Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5), 25 µl of  the substrate pNP-
ester at a final concentration of  0.5 mM and 25 µl of  the sample [ 23]. The absorbance 
at 405 nm was measured using a HACH DR 5000™ UV-Vis Spectrophotometer 
(HACH Loveland, CO, U.S.A.). The blank was Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.5) 
containing the substrate pNP-C10 (0.5 mM). All of  the measurements were performed 
by triplicate. The molar extinction coefficient used was 1.336 x 107 cm2. mol-1.
The specific lipolytic unit was defined as the amount of  enzyme that catalysed the 
formation of  1 µmol of  p-nitrophenol ( pNP) per min per 1 mg of  protein (U.mg-1). 
Quantification of  the total protein was performed using the Bradford technique, with 
spectrophotometry at 595 nm [ 24] using bovine serum albumin as the standard.
Identification of  culture variables for A. facilis strain USBA-GBX-505
We used a Plackett-Burman (PB) fractional factorial design in order to identify the 
culture variables that favoured higher levels of  biomass production and therefore 
enzymatic activity. The response surface methodology (RSM) was employed for 
obtaining the optimum concentration of  individual variables that potentially influence 
the response (lipolytic activity) [ 25]. The PB included eight culture factors at two 
levels, high (+1) and low (-1): peptone and yeast extract (5 and 10 g.L-1) as the organic 
nitrogen source; ammonium chloride (NH 4Cl, 0.1 and 1.0 g.L-1) and ammonium 
sulfate ((NH 4)2SO 4, 0 and 1.0 g.L-1) as the inorganic nitrogen source; Tween 80 and 48

ethyl oleate (0.1 and 1% (v/v)) as the carbon source and inducer of  lipolytic activity; 
pH (3.0 and 5.0); and agitation (0 and 200 r/min). Each experimental round was 
conducted by triplicate. The dependent variable was the specific intracellular lipolytic 
activity (U.mg-1) obtained from the cultured biomass after 96 h of  incubation.
We used Design-Expert (version 8) software (Stat-Ease, Inc. U.S.A.) to determine the 
level of  experimental error, corroborate the fit of  the first-order model and perform 
regression analysis of  the experimental results obtained. 
Central composite design (CCD)  
The experimental region of  the CCD comprised five levels (-1.68, -1, 0, 1, and 1.68) 
of  each of  the factors under evaluation [ 26]. The levels of  yeast extract, Tween 80® 
and agitation were evaluated in twenty treatments using Design-Expert (version 8) 
software, generating a CCD matrix that included axial and central points. All of  
the treatments were evaluated by triplicate. The dependent variable was the specific 
intracellular lipolytic activity (U.mg-1).
Statistical analysis of  experimental designs
The quality of  fit obtained using the first-order-model equation was expressed as 
the determination coefficient R2; its significance was determined using an F (Fisher) 
test, and the statistical significance of  the regression coefficients was corroborated 
using the Student’s t test. Analyses of  variance were performed to evaluate the results 
obtained using the PB design, CDD and quadratic model of  cultures of  A. facilis  
USBA-GBX-505 to be used for the production of  lipolytic enzyme. Data obtained 
from the RSM on lipase production were subjected to analysis of  variance (ANOVA).
Partial purification of  lipase 505 LIP
We used the following culture conditions for the production of  USBA-GBX-505 
microbial biomass: modified basal salt 991 medium, supplemented with 6.6 g.L-1 
of  yeast extract and 1% (v/v) Tween 80®, and incubation at 30 ºC for 4 d, with 
agitation at 200 r/min. The intracellular protein obtained as described above, was 
concentrated and pre-purified using an Amicon ultrafiltration unit of  50 kDa (Merck 
Millipore Corporation, Darmstadt, Germany) with centrifugation at 3,000 g for 15 
min. The resulting extract was loaded on a BioSep-SEC-3000 size-exclusion column 
(Shodex®, Germany) of  30 cm x 0.78 cm that had been equilibrated with 50 mM 
Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) and was subsequently eluted at a flow rate of  1 mL.min-1 at 
35 ºC for 20 min, with detection at 215 nm. We collected and then concentrated by 
ultrafiltration fractions of  2.5 mL for subsequent protein quantification, evaluation 
of  enzymatic activity and enzyme purification. The fraction exhibiting enzymatic 
activity that was collected using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) was loaded 
on an IEC-DEAE-2025 ion-exchange column (Shodex®) of  15 cm x 2 cm. Then, 
50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5 was applied at a flow rate of  1 mL.min-1 at 35 ºC 
for 20 min, after which a gradient of  0 to 1 M NaCl in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 was 
applied between 20 and 110 min, with detection at 280 nm. We collected, desalted and 
concentrated by ultrafiltration the subsequent fractions for the quantification of  the 
protein and lipolytic enzymatic activity. The fractions obtained using SEC and ion-
exchange chromatography (IEC) were evaluated using a diode array detector.49

The resulting protein fractions were analysed by electrophoresis in a 10% (w/v) 
polyacrylamide gel containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE) using a  
Mini-Protean II® system (BioRad, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc, U.S.A.) according 
to the Laemmli protocol [ 27]. Gel staining was performed using an ammoniacal 
silver-staining protocol [ 28]. The protein molecular weight marker used was V849A 
(Promega, USA).
Biochemical characterization of  purified enzyme 505 LIP 
For all the characterization assays, the quantification of  the lipolytic activity of  enzyme 505 
LIP was performed using the p-nitrophenyl-ester technique, with 0.5 mM pNP decanoate 
(C10) as the substrate, except for substrate specificity evaluations. We calculated the lipolytic 
activity as the percentage of  the residual activity, with 100% activity corresponding to the 
control (the enzyme without any interfering compound). The evaluations were performed 
using pNP-C10 at 55 ºC in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5).
Substrate specificity evaluations
Spectrophotometric method
The evaluation was done using p-NP ester substrates (Sigma-Aldrich) (described 
above) with different chain lengths at 50 °C and Tris–HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5). 
The p-NP esters evaluated were acetate (C2), butyrate (C4), octanoate (C8), decanoate 
(C10), dodecanoate (C12), hexadecanoate (C16) and octadecenoate (C18). All 
p-nitrophenyl esters were dissolved in 2-propanol to a final concentration of  0.5 mM. 
The p-nitrophenyl esters > C10 were also mixed with Triton X-100 (0.002 % (w/v) 
final concentration) (Sigma-Aldrich). 
Titrimetric method
We used the titration method to determine the free fatty acids concentrations, 
according to Seghal  et al. (2014) [ 7]. Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 5% (w/v) 
of  the lipidic substrate (tributyrine, tricapryline and trioleate) in Tris-HCl buffer (50 
mM, pH 7.5) and 1% of  Triton X-100. The reactions were incubated at 50 °C and 
200 r/min for 30 min. Then, we added acetone-ethanol mixture (1:1 v/v). The final 
analysis was carried out using a potentiometric titration technique with 50 mM KOH 
(end point pH 8.0).
Evaluation of  the optimal temperature and pH for enzymatic activity 
We evaluated the enzymatic activity at different temperatures in order to determine 
the optimal one, by exposing the enzyme for 30 min to temperatures ranging between 
30 ºC and 90 ºC in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5). Then, the lipolytic activity 
was quantified as described above. To evaluate the enzymatic activity under different  
pH conditions, different buffer solutions were used at 50 mM, including MES (pH 
5.2 – 6.7), Tris HCl (pH 7.0 – 9.0), HEPES (pH 6.8 – 8.2), BICINE (pH 7.6 – 9.0) 
and sodium carbonate (pH 9.0 – 11.0). The enzyme was incubated for 30 min at room 
temperature (23 ºC ± 2) and then the lipolytic activity was quantified at 55 ºC using 
pNP-C10.50

Effect of  various additives on the activity of  505 LIP
We evaluated the effect of  different chemical substances on the enzymatic activity by 
incubating the protein in the presence of  each substance for 1 h at room temperature 
(23 ºC ± 2). We evaluated the effect of  metallic ions as Ca2+, Fe3+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, 
and Mn2+ at two concentrations, 1 mM and 10 mM, except for the Fe3+ ion, which 
was evaluated at 1 mM and 5 mM due to the interference caused by the colour 
formation at 10 mM. The effect of  sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), Tween 20, Tween 
80 and Triton X-100 was evaluated at concentrations of  1 and 5% (v/v). The effect 
of  the inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), ethylenediaminetetraacetic 
acid (EDTA), 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), and dithiothreitol (DTT) was evaluated at 
5 mM as final concentration. 
Effect of  organic solvents on the stability of  505 LIP
The enzymatic activity was also evaluated in the presence of  several organic solvents, 
including 1-butanol, acetonitrile, acetone, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, methanol, ethanol, 
glycerol and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 15 and 30% (v/v).The stability of  the 
enzyme was determined in the presence of  15% (v/v) methanol and 30% (v/v) 
glycerol at room temperature (23 °C ± 2) for 192 h. The reaction conditions were  
55 ºC and pH 7.5, and the substrate used was p-NPC10 at 0.5 mM. 
All of  the chemical products used were of  the purest grades available.
Results and Discussion
While searching for extremozymes produced by thermophilic and acidophilic 
microorganisms in the acidic hot springs at Los Nevados NNP , we isolated several 
microorganisms with diverse characteristics and lipolytic activities such as the 
thermoacidophilic alpha-Proteobacterium Acidicaldus  USBA-GBX-499 [ 15] and the 
A. facilis  strain USBA-GBX-505 [ 20]. 
In order to identify the factors that significantly affect the growth of  A. facilis   
USBA-GBX-505 for the production of  biomass and lipolytic enzymes, a PB fractional 
factorial design was developed. Treatment 2 exhibited the highest lipolytic activity 
(0.23 U.mg-1). This treatment consisted of  the organic nitrogen sources (peptone 
and yeast extract) and ethyl oleate at a high level (10 g.L-1 and 1% v/v), the sources 
of  inorganic nitrogen (NH 4Cl and (NH 4)2SO 4) at a low level (0.1 g.L-1 and 0 g.L-1, 
respectively), and the cultures incubated at high level agitation rate (200 r/min). In 
contrast, the lowest level of  activity was detected in treatment 8 (0.002 U.mg-1) and no 
lipolytic activity was detected (0 U.mg-1) in treatments 10 and 12. All three of  these 
treatments had low levels of  agitation (0 r/min) and yeast extract (5 g.L-1). These 
results showed that little or no growth of  the microorganism occurred in the absence 
of  agitation or with a low level of  yeast extract. 
The analysis of  variance (ANOVA) of  the PB design ( Table 1 ) showed that the 
variables yeast extract, Tween 80® and agitation were the culture factors that 
significantly ( p < 0.05) affected the production of  biomass and hence of  lipolytic 
enzymes. The nitrogen source for any microorganism serves as a secondary energy 
source for growth and enzyme secretion; the nitrogen is especially important in 51

regulating the synthesis of  hydrolases [ 29]. Sharma et al., (2012) [ 30] showed that 
yeast extract was the main nitrogen source for lipase production by B. licheniformis  
MTCC-10498. In contrast, ammonium phosphate was the main source of  nitrogen 
for lipase production by G. thermoleovorans  DA2 [ 31]. The Tween 80® is widely used as 
a carbon source by microorganisms producing esterases such as Acidiphilum  sp. AIU 
(formally, Acidocella facilis ) [32] and Acidocella aminolytica  [33]. From our results, ethyl 
oleate, peptone, inorganic nitrogen sources ((NH 4)2SO 4, NH 4Cl) and pH did not have 
a significant effect. 
The first-order model generated through the data analysis indicated a sample variation 
of  98.9%. Therefore, we can deduce that there was a relationship between the culture 
factors of  A. facilis  USBA-GBX-505 and its production of  lipolytic enzyme. Only 1.1% 
of  the total variation could not be explained by the model. Even the R2
Pred of  0.929 
demonstrated that there was a strong correlation between the experimental values and 
the values predicted using the following linear model:
Equation 1. First order model:
U.mg-1 = 0.038 + 6.9 x 10-3A + 6.2 x 10-3B + 3.5 x 10-3C + 0.024 D –

where A: Tween80®, B: Ethyl oleate, C: Peptone, D: Yeast extract, E: (NH4)2SO4,  
F: NH4Cl, G: pH, H: Agitation, and K: Dummy2.
The positive regression coefficient of  0.024 ( p = 0.0038), 0.025 ( p = 0.0037) and  
6.9 x 10-3 (p=0.0447) for yeast extract, agitation and Tween 80®, respectively, 
confirmed that these factors had a significantly positive effect on the production of  
lipolytic enzymes by A. facilis  USBA-GBX-505. Therefore, we used these factors in the 
CCD experiment.
Considering that all three significant factors had a positive effect in the PB-design-
based experiment, we decided that the highest levels of  yeast extract and Tween 80®, 
previously evaluated using the PB design, would be the low levels in the CCD-based 
experiment. Hence, in the CCD-based experiment, the low level of  yeast extract was 
10 g.L-1 and that of  Tween 80® was 1 % (v/v). In the PB-design-based experiment, two 
agitation levels were evaluated, low (0 r/min) and high (200 r/min), and a tendency 
towards a higher lipolytic activity was observed in the treatments with a high agitation 
level; therefore we decided to evaluate agitation rates that were lower and higher than 
200 r/min. Three factors were evaluated at 5 levels for a total of  20 treatments. Table 
2 shows the composition of  each of  the experimental treatments and their respective 
specific lipolytic activities.
Treatment 9 had the maximal intracellular lipolytic activity of  0.6 U.mg-1 experimental 
and 0.5 U.mg-1 predicted, as well as the highest biomass level of  8 x 107 CFU.
mL-1. In contrast, treatments 2, 6, 8, 10 and 12 did not show any lipolytic activity 
(Table 2 ). Table S1  shows the ANOVA results used to compare the mean values at  
p = 0.001 ( p < 0.05), which demonstrated that there were significant differences among 
the treatments. The results confirmed that treatment 9 independently stimulated the 
production of  lipases by A. facilis  USBA-GBX-505 and that the levels of  Tween 80®, 
yeast extract and agitation used in treatment 9 enhanced the production of  lipolytic 53

enzymes by this chemoorganotrophic organism whose growth is favoured by protein 
substrates [ 34]. These substrates most likely served not only as nitrogen sources but 
also as sources of  B-complex vitamins, as reported before [ 35]. Moreover, previous 
reports indicate that the sources of  organic nitrogen affect the growth of  the organism 
and are directly related to the production of  lipases [ 36].TToA B C*Specific lipolytic activity

The experimental data obtained were analysed using the surface response methodology, 
and the fit of  the second-order model was evaluated and the coefficients of  the 
second-order polynomial were generated through multiple regressions. The quality of  
the fit of  the model ( p = 0.0433) was evaluated using the determination coefficients 
and an ANOVA. The quadratic model of  the response surface was adjusted using the 
following equation:

where: A: Yeast extract, B: Agitation, and C: Tween 80®.
Based on the results of  the ANOVA of  the CCD-based experiment ( Table 3 ), the 
Fisher F value at 3.17 and the p value (0.0433, p < 0.05), we consider that the model 
(Equation 2 ) was significant. The highest F values were observed for yeast extract 
(A) and agitation2 (B2); therefore, these two values had a significant effect ( p < 0.05) 
on the growth of  A. facilis  USBA-GBX-505 for the production of  lipolytic enzymes. 
Likewise, as shown in Table 3, the quadratic effect of  the agitation rate ( p = 0.0049) 
was significant compared with its linear effect ( p = 0.6560). The other significant value 
for the production of  lipases was the linear effect of  the yeast extract level ( p = 0.0046). 
In summary, yeast extract and agitation were the factors that had a significant effect

enzymes. Figure 1  shows the interaction between these two factors in which the best 
response was observed using an agitation rate of  200 r/min and 10 g.L-1 of  yeast 
extract. An inversely proportional linear effect of  the yeast extract level and the specific 
lipolytic activity was also observed. This result indicated the possibility that at a yeast 
extract concentration of  less than 10 g.L-1, lipase production might increase. This result 
is similar to that reported for Burkholderia  sp. strain C20, for which a concentration of  
yeast extract greater than 2 g.L-1 caused a decrease in lipase production, likely due to 
substrate inhibition of  the nitrogen source [ 37]. The other significant factor for the 
production of  lipolytic enzymes by A. facilis  USBA-GBX-505 was the agitation rate. 
The agitation rate is one of  the most important culture parameters because increasing 
this rate increases the oxygen transfer rate as well as the mixing efficiency of  the culture, 
finally leading to increased cellular growth and lipase production [ 38]. Such is the case 
of  Acinetobacter radioresistens , for which the optimal yield of  lipases was observed at an 
agitation rate of  600 r/min [ 39].
In summary, we observed the highest specific activity in treatment 9, which increased 
the enzymatic activity level by 4.5-fold compared with that obtained using the initial 
culture conditions (agitation at 0 r/min, 5 g.L-1 peptone, 1 g.L-1 yeast extract and 1% 
(v/v) Tween 80®), under which the intracellular specific enzymatic activity was only 0.13 
U.mg-1 (data not shown). Tween 80® is one of  the factors improving the production of  
the lipase enzyme by A. facilis  strain USBA-GBX-505 in the first screening experiments 
conducted with the PB-based design; it has also been reported to be important for 
Fig. 1. Response surface curve showing the effect of  yeast extract (YE) and agitation on the culture of  
Acidocella facilis  USBA-GBX-505 for the production of  lipolytic enzymes.56

other organisms, such as Burkholderia glumae  PG1 [ 40] and Staphylococcus epidermidis  AT2 
[41]. Tween 80®, a surfactant agent, is also used as a substrate for the production of  
lipases and esterases, in many cases efficiently increasing their synthesis rate [ 42]. For 
A. facilis  USBA-GBX-505, this compound could serve as the only carbon source and 
as an inducer of  lipolytic activity.
The analysis of  the factors associated with the production of  microbial lipolytic enzymes 
has been the focus of  various studies because it is known that each microorganism has 
specific requirements and particular conditions for the maximization of  the production 
of  enzymes. Among the factors associated with the production of  lipases are lipid 
inducers, which are mainly used as carbon sources, organic and inorganic nitrogen 
sources and oligo elements, among others [ 36]. To date, the only knowledge regarding 
optimization of  the production of  lipolytic enzymes by an acidophilic microorganism 
concerned a strain of  Bacillus pumilus , which grows at pH 1.0, for which the production 
of  an acid lipase was enhanced by optimizing the pH, temperature and lipid-substrate 
concentration (palm oil: 5% (v/v)) [ 43]. Likewise, there are reports concerning fungi 
such as Aspergillus wentii  that grow at a pH lower than 5.0, for which the yield of  lipase 
was increased by adding peptone and yeast extract to the culture medium [ 44].
Our results demonstrated the culture conditions for A. facilis  strain USBA-GBX-505 
that increased its lipase production, which were as follows: modified 991 medium 
supplemented with yeast extract at 6.6 g.L-1 and Tween 80® at 1.5% (v/v), with an 
agitation rate of  200 r/min. Next, we proceeded to culture A. facilis  USBA-GBX-505 
under these particular conditions to obtain a protein extract with lipolytic activity and 
then to biochemically characterize the lipolytic enzyme it produces.
Partial purification of  the lipolytic enzyme of  A. facilis USBA-GBX-505
We established a purification method for lipolytic enzymes based on semi-preparative 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The intracellular protein extract, 
obtained as previously described, was concentrated using 50 kDa Amicon ultrafiltration 
units, yielding two fractions: the first fraction containing proteins of  < 50 kDa and the 
second fraction containing proteins of  > 50 kDa. Assessing the lipolytic activity of  the 
two fractions demonstrated that the second fraction had lipolytic activity. Therefore, 
we used this fraction for subsequent purification using SEC, from which three 
fractions were collected; the first fraction, collected between 5 and 7.5 min, showed 
lipolytic activity. This fraction was concentrated using a filtration system designed for 
50 kDa proteins, after which IEC was used to increase the purity level of  the active 
fraction. This fraction was eluted from the ion-exchange column at 180 min in 0.8 M 
NaCl/50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The changes in the purity level of  the active fraction 
throughout the partial purification process and the molecular mass of  the enzyme 
were determined using SDS-PAGE ( Figure 2 ). In the third lane of  the SDS-PAGE 
gel shown in Figure 2 , which corresponds to the active fraction obtained using IEC, 
multiple bands were observed, indicating that the active protein was partially purified. 
This enzyme, denominated 505 LIP , had a molecular weight greater than 77 kDa. 
The extracellular esterase that was isolated and purified from A. facilis  strain AIU409 
using genomic methods had a molecular weight of  ~64 kDa [ 45], indicating that that 
esterase and the 505 LIP are two different kinds of  esterases, which are expressed in 
two different strains of  the same species.57
Correa Toral et al.
Universitas Scientiarum Vol. 22 (1): 45-70
http://ciencias.javeriana.edu.co/investigacion/universitas-scientiarum
The enzyme 505 LIP was purified with a recovery yield of  16%. The specific activity 
of  this enzyme was 6.3 U.mg-1, and the recovery factor of  its activity was 2.3 times 
greater than prior to purification ( Table 4 ). Several authors have stated that protein 
purification yields of  between 2 and 20 % could be due to the formation of  protein 
aggregates during purification because a large amount of  enzyme can be lost as 
insoluble material, particularly when solutions with a pH of  < 12 are used [ 46, 47].

Biochemical characterization of  the lipolytic enzyme  505 LIP 
The highest enzymatic activity of  the 505 LIP was exhibited towards medium-chained 
pNP esters ( Figure 3 ), such as decanoate (C10) and dodecanoate (C12), a finding that 
allowed to establish that the 505 LIP is a lipase, given that true lipases are enzymes 
that hydrolyse long-chain acylglycerols (with > 10 carbon atoms) and natural lipids 
[3]. However, its activity towards C16- and C18-acylglycerols was greatly decreased 
and a low level of  enzymatic activity towards short- (C4) and medium-chained (C8) 
substrates was observed. Moreover, we evaluated the lipolytic activity on tributyrine, 
tricapryline and trioleate, and the results showed partial hydrolysis of  5, 40 and 10 % 
respectively after 24 h of  reaction.
The optimal temperature for the 505 LIP activity was measured in the range of   
30 °C to 90 ºC ( Figure 4 ) using pNP-C10 as the substrate. The highest levels of  
activity were observed between 45 °C and 60 ºC, with 55 ºC being the temperature 
at which the maximal activity toward pNP-C10 was detected. The lipolytic activity 
decreased by more than 50% at temperatures of  less than 40 ºC and greater than 65 
ºC. Therefore, the enzyme 505 LIP is classified as moderately thermophilic, with an 
optimal lipolytic activity temperature of  55 ºC. The optimal temperature of  the enzyme 
505 LIP also differed from that of  the esterase produced by A. facilis  AIU409, which 
had an optimal temperature of  70 ºC [ 45]. However, the optimal temperature of  the 
505 LIP is similar to that of  the lipase derived from the acidophilic organism B. pumilus   
(50 ºC). Other lipolytic enzymes derived from acidophilic organisms include the lipolytic

fatty acid chains of  4 to 18 C-atoms. Activities are shown as percentages of  the maximum activity 
(10.96 U/mg). Values are means ± SD from three independent experiments.59

enzyme produced by the thermoacidophilic microorganism Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius , 
with an optimal temperature of  60 ºC [ 48], and the thermophilic esterase produced by 
Acidicaldus sp. USBA-GBX-499, with an optimal temperature of  55 ºC [ 23].
The lipolytic activity of  the 505 LIP was detected at pH values of  between 6.0 and 9.0, 
with maximal activity observed at pH 7.5 (9.76 U •mg-1 lipolytic activity of  505 LIP), and 
the enzymatic activity decreased as the pH became more alkaline. In contrast, the optimal 
pH for the growth of  A. facilis  strain USBA-GBX-505 was pH 3.5. The optimal pH 
value for the growth of  this strain is probably different to the intracellular pH values of  
several acidophilic organisms that have various strategies for adaptation under acidic pH 
conditions, which are related to maintaining their intracellular pH at an approximately 
neutral value [ 49]. This result contrasts with that reported for the extracellular esterase 
of  A. facilis  AIU409, whose optimal activity was observed at pH 4.0 [ 45]. This optimal 
pH also differs from that of  the lipase produced by the acidophilic microorganism B. 
pumilus , which had an optimal enzymatic activity at pH 1.0. The enzyme activity also 
could be affected by the buffer composition, because the enzymes have preferences for 
ionic strength (salt concentration) and major cation (sodium or potassium).
Effect of  metallic ions on the activity of  the enzyme 505 LIP  
The activity of  the enzyme 505 LIP decreased in the presence of  various ions at 1 and 
10 mM ( Table 5 ), by between 40 and 100%, becoming totally inhibited in the presence 
of  Fe2+ ions. This finding is contrary to those previously reported on lipolytic enzymes, 
Fig. 4. Evaluation of  lipolytic activity of  the enzyme 505 LIP on p-nitrophenyl ( pNP) esters with  
fatty acid chains of  4 to 18 C-atoms. Activities are shown as percentages of  the maximum activity

which showed that metallic ions can play an important role in maintaining enzymatic 
structural stability and integrity [ 50], for example the presence of  Fe3+ and Mn2+ at 1 
mM increased the relative enzymatic activity of  the 499EST esterase of  Acidicaldus 
USBA-GBX-499 [ 23]. Moreover, under particular conditions, the presence of  metallic 
cofactors facilitated the correct folding of  an enzyme [ 51] and stabilized the structure 
of  the catalytic site of  Geobacillus zalihae  lipase [ 52]. The negative effects of  metallic 
ions on the activity of  proteins could be explained by undesired interactions occurring 
between ions and the lateral chains of  their amino acids, specifically those involving 
their surface amino acids, causing ionization of  these amino acids [ 53].Residual Activity (%)

The organic solvents 1-butanol and DMSO inhibited the activity of  the 505 LIP . 
The loss of  enzymatic activity in an organic medium has been found to be due to 
destabilization of  the hydrophobic zone of  the evaluated protein, and even polar 
solvents were found to penetrate the protein and induce structural changes [ 54]. The 
activity of  the enzyme 505 LIP decreased in the presence of  acetonitrile, ethanol, 
1-propanol and 2-propanol but was not totally inhibited. The lipolytic activity of  the 
505 LIP was enhanced in the presence of  acetone at 15% (v/v), methanol at 15% (v/v) 
and glycerol at 30% (v/v) ( Table 5 ). The positive effect of  these factors on lipolytic 
activity levels has been reported for other lipolytic enzymes, e.g., the Pyrococcus furiosus  
phospholipase, which has an increased level of  enzymatic activity in the presence of  
methanol and ethanol [ 55] and the Aspergillus carneus  thermal-alkaline-resistant esterase, 
which has an increased level of  activity and thermal stability in the presence of  
glycerol [ 56]. Stability in the presence of  organic solvents is an important property for 
lipolytic enzymes that are used in non-aqueous systems because it ensures that catalytic 
reactions can occur under these conditions [ 57]. This can expand the repertoires of  
transformations catalysed by lipases, where numerous reactions might be used in the 
field of  synthetic and polymeric chemistry with high selectivity [ 58]. The presence 
of  organic solvents, such as glycerol in the reaction medium of  a lipolytic enzyme, 
can improve enzymatic activity because they can promote the formation of  some 
hydrogen bonds under anhydrous conditions, generating stable conformations and 
avoiding structural rigidity and the occurrence of  strong electrostatic interactions [ 59, 
60]. Lipases with stability on organic solvents are required for the synthesis of  many 
useful products, such as the production of  biopolymeric materials, biodiesel and in the 
synthesis of  fine chemicals [ 61, 62].
Effect of  methanol and glycerol on the stability of  the enzyme 505 LIP 
Since methanol at 15 % (v/v) and glycerol at 30 % (v/v) increased the enzymatic 
activity, the stability of  this protein in the presence of  those substrates was evaluated 
(Figure 5 ). We found that the enzyme 505 LIP not only remained stable in the presence 
of  glycerol for 8 d at room temperature (23 ºC ± 2) but that its activity increased by  
50 %. On the other hand, in the presence of  methanol, the enzymatic activity increased 
during the first 24 h of  incubation and then decreased by 96 %. The enzymatic stability 
in the presence of  solvents is relevant because they can increase the solubility of  non-
polar substrates and the thermal stability of  enzymes as well as decrease the levels 
of  water-dependent secondary reactions [ 60, 63]. The polymerization reactions and 
transesterifications demand harsh conditions provided by the presence of  organic 
solvents and/or high temperature, furthermore industrial lipolytic enzymes are often 
used in organic media rather than aqueous media [ 64].
Effect of  detergents on the activity of  the enzyme  505 LIP 
Regarding the effect of  detergents on the enzymatic activity ( Table 5 ), this enzyme 
exhibited only 10 % of  activity in the presence of  SDS, in contrast to Triton X-100 
and Tween 80, which showed an enzymatic activity of  80 - 90 %. The SDS molecules 
bind to proteins mainly via hydrophobic interactions, causing the unfolding of  their 
tertiary structures and affecting their activities [ 65]. In contrast, non-ionic surfactants 
such as Tween 20® increased the enzymatic activity of  the 505 LIP by up to 22 %.

Supplementation with a detergent is widely used in biocatalytic settings to resolve 
pharmaceutical intermediates in non-aqueous media [ 66]. Additionally, non-ionic 
surfactants can prevent the denaturation and aggregation of  proteins [ 67]. It has also 
been reported that Tween 80® can adversely affect protein stability by causing oxidative 
damage generated by residual peroxides of  Tween 80® that have undergone auto-
oxidation [ 68].
Effect of  inhibitors on the activity of  the enzyme 505 LIP 
The evaluation of  the effect of  inhibitors on the enzymatic activity ( Table 5 ) shows 
that EDTA inhibited this activity by 70 % and that PMSF inhibited this activity by  
73 %. PMSF is known to inhibit enzymatic activity by affecting the serine in the 
catalytic site [ 10], and it is likely that the decrease in the enzymatic activity was caused by 
modification of  an essential serine residue in the active site [ 63]. The reduced enzymatic 
activity observed in the presence of  the reducing agents DTT and β-ME could be due 
to the reduction of  covalent disulfide bonds between the cysteine residues within this 
protein, thereby affecting its stability and structure.
Conclusions
The yeast extract and agitation were key factors in increasing the biomass of  A. facilis  
strain USBA-GBX-505 and therefore increasing its growth-associated lipolytic activity. 
The activity of  intracellular lipolytic enzyme from A. facilis  strain USBA-GBX-505 was

fatty acid chains of  4 to 18 C-atoms. Activities are shown as percentages of  the maximum activity 
(10.96 U/mg). Values are means ± SD from three independent experiments.63

improved by 4.5-fold once the strain was cultured with supplementation of  6.6 g.L-1 
yeast extract and 1 % (v/v) Tween 80®, and incubation at 30 ºC for 4 d, with agitation 
at 200 r/min. The partial purification of  this enzyme using SEC and IEC provided 
a recovery yield of  16%. The partially purified enzyme, the 505 LIP , is a moderately 
thermophilic, intracellular lipase (55 ºC) that exhibited the highest enzymatic activity 
toward middle-chain substrates, particularly pNP-C10, at a neutral pH (pH 7.5). 
The activity of  this enzyme is favoured by organic solvents such as glycerol and 
methanol. This enzyme is stable in the presence of  these solvents for a period of  8 
d. These characteristics differed from those reported for the esterase produced by  
A. facilis  strain AIU409 (called AIU409), suggesting that the enzyme 505 LIP is a novel 
enzyme produced by a member of  the Acidocella facilis  species. In further studies, the 
esterification and transesterification reactions of  the 505 LIP will be evaluated based 
on the biochemical characteristics already determined in this study.

Metodología de Superficie de Respuesta (RSM) para el análisis de las condiciones de cultivo de 
Acidocella facilis  cepa USBA-GBX-505 y la purificación parcial y caracterización bioquímica 
de la lipasa 505 LIP
Resumen.  Por medio de la Metodología de Respuesta de Superficie (RSM) evaluamos las condiciones 
de cultivo (fuente de N, fuente de C, pH y tasa de agitación) que incrementan la biomasa de Acidocella 
facilis cepa USBA-GBX-505 y, como consecuencia, la producción de su enzima lipolítica, llamada  
505 LIP . Los resultados de la RSM revelaron que el extracto de levadura y la agitación fueron factores 
de cultivo claves, que incrementaron de 4 a 5 veces la actividad lipolítica asociada al crecimiento 
(de 0.13 U.mg-1 a 0.6 U.mg-1). La lipasa 505 LIP se purificó parcialmente usando cromatografía de 
exclusión por tamaño y cromatografía de intercambio iónico. Su peso molecular fue > 77 kDa. La 
enzima muestra su actividad catalítica óptima a 55 °C y pH 7.5. El EDTA, el PMSF, el 1-butanol 
y el DMSO inhibieron la actividad enzimática, mientras que el Tween 20, la acetona, el glicerol  
y el metanol la incrementaron. La enzima 505 LIP no requiere iones metálicos para su actividad,  
e incluso se inhibe en presencia de ellos. Este estudio muestra el uso potencial de A. facilis  cepa  
USBA-GBX-505 para la producción de una nueva enzima lipolítica, 505 LIP , que es estable a 
temperaturas moderadas y en la presencia de solventes orgánicos. Estas son características importantes 
en la síntesis de muchos productos útiles.

Resumo.  Utilizando a Metodologia de Superfície de Resposta (MSR) avaliamos as condições de 
cultivo (fontes de nitrogênio e carbono, pH e taxa de agitação) que aumentam a biomassa de Acidocella 
facilis cepa USBA-GBX-505, e, portanto, elevam a produção de sua enzima lipolítica 505 LIP . Os 
resultados da MSR revelaram que o extrato de levedura e a agitação foram fatores de cultivo chave 
que permitiram aumentar 4 a 5 vezes a atividade lipolítica associada ao crescimento (de 0,13 U.mg-1 
a 0,6 U.mg-1). A lipase 505 LIP foi parcialmente purificada utilizando cromatografia por exclusão de 
tamanho e cromatografia de intercambio iônico. Seu peso molecular foi > 77 kDa. A enzima mostra 
sua atividade catalítica ótima a 55 °C e pH 7,5. EDTA, PMSF, 1-butanol e DMSO inibiram a atividade 
enzimática, enquanto que Tween 20, acetona, glicerol e metanol aumentaram esta atividade. Íons 
metálicos não são necessários para a atividade da 505 LIP , apresentando inclusive efeito inibitório da 
enzima. Este estudo demonstra o potencial uso de A. facilis  cepa USBA-GBX-505 para a produção 
de uma nova enzima lipolítica, 505 LIP , a qual é estável a moderadas temperaturas e na presença de 
solventes orgânicos. Estas características são importantes para a síntese de diversos produtos úteis.
