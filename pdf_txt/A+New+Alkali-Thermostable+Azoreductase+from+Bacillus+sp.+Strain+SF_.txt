A screening for dye-decolorizing alkali-thermophilic microorganisms resulted in a Bacillus sp.strain isolated
out of the wastewater drain of a textile ﬁnishing company. An NADH-dependent azoreductase of this strain,Bacillus sp. strain SF, was found to be responsible for the decolorization of azo dyes. This enzyme was puriﬁed
by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and anion-exchange and afﬁnity chromatography and hada molecular mass of 61.6 kDa and an isoelectric point at pH 5.3. The pH optimum of the azoreductase dependedon the substrate and was within the range of pHs 8 to 9, while the temperature maximum was reached at 80°C.Decolorization only took place in the absence of oxygen and was enhanced by FAD, which was not consumedduring the reaction. A 26% similarity of this azoreductase to chaperonin Cpn60 from a Bacillus sp. was found
by peptide mass mapping experiments. Substrate speciﬁcities of the azoreductase were studied by usingsynthesized model substrates based on di-sodium-( R)-benzyl-azo-2,7-dihydroxy-3,6-disulfonyl-naphthaline.
Those dyes with NO
2substituents, especially in the ortho position, were degraded fastest, while analogues with
a methyl substitution showed the lowest degradation rates.
In the last few years, environmental legislation, e.g., about
the appearance of color in discharges, combined with the in-creasing cost of water for the industrial sector, has made thetreatment and reuse of dyeing efﬂuents increasingly attractiveto the industry. The common method for the treatment ofwastewater in the textile ﬁnishing industry is physicochemicalﬂocculation in combination with biological treatment (17). Theconventional treatment of colored efﬂuents produces a lot ofsludge, but does not remove all dyes, thus preventing recyclingof the treated wastewater. In activated sludge treatments, dye-ing efﬂuents, e.g., reactive azo dyes and naphthaline-sulfonicacids as well as aromatic amino derivatives, represent an ex-tensive nonbiodegradable class of compounds (18) and caneven inhibit activated sludge organisms. Thus, the develop-ment of more effective biological systems for the treatment ofthese types of wastewater has resulted in considerable interestby the industry.
Wood-rotting fungi (e.g., Phanerochaete chrysosporium ,Tra-
metes sp., and Aspergillus sp.) have been found to effectively
degrade a variety of azo dyes under aerobic conditions (16).Dye-degrading fungi have been used frequently in bioreactorsfor the decolorization and degradation of azo dyes (37). Whilefungal treatment of efﬂuents is usually very time-consuming(3), immobilized enzymes could have potential for dye decol-orization and recycling of efﬂuents (1) without the need for theaddition of growth substrates. The enzymes involved in thedegradation of azo dyes are mainly peroxidases (12) and lac-cases (1). However, a signiﬁcant cost reduction for these en-zymes would be required in order to make this process eco-nomically more attractive.
Aerobic bacteria have been described to oxidatively decol-orize many dyes from several classes, among which azo dyes
always turned out to be the most recalcitrant compounds (16).
In contrast, under anaerobic conditions, the decolorization ofmany azo dyes via reduction of the azo bond has been shownfor anaerobic (e.g., Bacteroides sp.,Eubacterium sp., and Clos-
tridium sp.) as well as facultative anaerobic (e.g., Proteus vul-
garis and Streptococcus faecalis ) bacteria (5, 11, 30, 36). The
main interest in this ﬁeld has been focused on bacteria fromthe human intestine that are involved in the metabolism of azodyes ingested as food additives (9). The fecal enzyme activity ofazoreductase is commonly considered a marker for procarci-nogenic activity (14). The nonspeciﬁcity of the azoreductasereaction is also demonstrated by many reports on the decolor-ization of azo dyes by sewage sludge under anaerobic condi-tions (6, 28). It seems that almost all azo compounds tested arebiologically reduced under anaerobic conditions, althoughthere are some indications that metal-ion-containing dyes some-times have reduced decolorization rates (8).
Earlier studies with facultative anaerobic bacteria repeatedly
suggested that reduced ﬂavins generated by cytosolic ﬂavine-dependent reductases (ﬂavine reductases) were responsible forthe unspeciﬁc reduction of azo dyes (31, 35). The ability ofcytosolic ﬂavine reductases to act in vitro as azoreductases wasrecently demonstrated by experiments using a recombinantﬂavine reductase in different genetic backgrounds (32). Cellextracts generally showed much higher rates of anaerobic re-duction of azo dyes than did preparations of resting cells (23,36). This has generally been explained by the low permeabilityof the cell membranes for the highly polar sulfonated azocompounds (32).
A different model for the nonspeciﬁc reduction of azo dyes
by bacteria which does not require transport of the azo dyes orreduced ﬂavins through the cell membrane was recently sug-gested for Sphingomonas xenophaga BN6. It was proposed that
in this system quinines act as redox mediators which are re-duced by a quinone reductase located in the cell membrane of

provided by Universidade do Minho: RepositoriUMSphingomonas xenophaga BN6 and that the hydroquinones
formed reduce the azo dyes in the culture supernatants in apurely chemical redox reaction (19). Additionally, some pub-lications exist which describe the extracellular reduction ofazo dyes by anaerobic bacteria (30), although it remains un-clear how an extracellular azoreductase would have access toNADH, which is necessary for the reduction of azo dyes.
The reduction of azo compounds has also been shown to
occur under aerobic conditions. Degradation pathways of4-carboxy-4 /H11032-sulfoazobenzene, with reductive cleavage of the
azo double bond as the initial degradation step, have beenestablished (4). The aerobic azoreductases from the carboxy-orange-degrading Pseudomonas strains K22 and KF46 are mo-
nomeric ﬂavine-free enzymes that use NADPH and NADH as
cofactors and reductively cleave several sulfonated azo dyes(38, 39). The enzymes (21 and 30 kDa) show different sub-
strate speci ﬁcities, while both require the presence of hydroxyl
groups in the aromatic ring of the substrate.
Although several microorganisms seem to have potential for
azo dye degradation, very few strains can withstand the condi-tions of dying ef ﬂuents in terms of pH and temperature. In this
study, we describe an azoreductase from a newly isolated al-kali-thermophilic Bacillus sp. growing at pH 9.5 and 65 °C.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Screening of dye-decolorizing microorganisms. Three Bacillus sp. isolates ( Ba-
cillus sp. strain SF, Bacillus sp. strain LF, and Bacillus pallidus ), previously
isolated from a wastewater drain of a textile ﬁnishing company (27), were incu-
bated on petri dishes for 1 week at 50 °C with the following medium (sterile): 250
ml of tap water, 9.25 g of standard I nutrient agar (Merck KGaA), 1.05 g ofNaHCO
3, and 10 mg of dye. The pH was controlled to 7.0 and 9.5, and growth
and decolorization were monitored visually. Further experiments were carried
out in 300-ml baf ﬂed Erlenmeyer ﬂasks on a rotary shaker at 65 °C and 160 rpm.
The cultivation medium consisted of the following (in grams per liter): yeastextract (Merck), 3.0; peptone from casein (Merck), 3.0 NaHCO
3, 4.2; KH2PO4,
1.0; and 1 ml of trace element solution SL-6 (29) per liter. The pH was adjusted
to 9.0 and the dye concentration was 0.1 g l/H110021. Flasks containing 90 ml of medium
were inoculated with 10 ml of microorganism suspension from precultures, and
dyes were added from stock solutions. The dyes Mordant Black 9 and MordantBlack 96 were from Dyestar (Frankfurt, Germany), Acid Blue 225 and DisperseRed 86 were from Ciba (Basel, Switzerland), and all other dyes were from Sigma.All dye names are given according to the color index (http://www.colour-index.org) when structures are available. Growth was monitored under a microscope,and dye degradation was measured by spectrophotometric determination of theabsorbance at the wavelength maximum for each dye. Blanks were run by adding100 mg of thiomersal [sodium ethyl-(2-mercaptobenzoato-(2)- O,S)-mercurate]
per liter to prevent growth, taking into consideration the possible adsorption ofthe dyestuff on biomass.
Cultivation of Bacillus sp. strain SF. Bacillus strain SF was grown in 300-ml
bafﬂed Erlenmeyer ﬂasks on a rotary shaker at 60 °C and 160 rpm in a medium
consisting of the following components (in grams per liter): KH
2PO4, 3.5;
Na2HPO4/H185287H2O, 7.5; yeast extract (Merck), 10.0; peptone from casein (Merck),
20.0; NH4SO4, 2.5; MgSO4/H185287H2O, 4.5; MnSO4/H18528H2O, 0.2; iron citrate /H185285H2O,
0.7; and 2.5% (vol/vol) SL-6 trace element solution, as described previously (29).
SL-6 trace element solution contained the following (in milligrams per liter):ZnSO
4/H185287H2O, 100.0; MnCl2/H185284H2O, 30.0; H3BO3, 300.0; CuCl2/H185282H2O, 10.0;
NiCl2/H185286.0H2O, 20.0; Na2MoO4/H185282H2O, 30.0; and CoCl2/H185286H2O, 200.0. To avoid
precipitation of salts during sterilization in an autoclave, MnSO4/H18528H2O, MgSO4
/H185287H2O, and iron citrate /H185285H2O were autoclaved separately, and the two solutions
were combined sterilely after they were cooled in a laminar ﬂow hood.
Ten-liter fermentations were carried out in a Chemap-CF 2000 fermentor,
using the cultivation medium described above. The fermentor was equipped withpH and oxygen controls. Precultures were grown in baf ﬂed Erlenmeyer ﬂasks as
described above.
Downstream processing. Cells were harvested at the end of the exponential
phase of growth and centrifuged for 15 min at 3,000 /H11003g, and the pellet was
suspended in an equal volume of 50 mM NaH
2PO4buffer (pH 7.0). Cell disrup -tion was carried out by using a soni ﬁcation unit (Sonoplus HD 70; Bandelin,
Berlin, Germany), with monitoring of progress under the microscope. The celldebris was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 23,700 relative centrifugalforce, and the remaining cell lysate was stored at 4 °C. During fermentation of
Bacillus strain SF, samples of 50 ml were taken every 30 min and were treated
similarly.
Assay for azoreductase activity. Assays were carried out in cuvettes (path
length /H110051 cm) with a total volume of 1 ml. All substances were dissolved in 50
mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at 50 °C and degassed with N
2for 5 min. Four
hundred microliters of phosphate buffer was mixed with 200 /H9262l of sample and 200
/H9262l of Reactive Black 5 (100 mg liter/H110021), resulting in a ﬁnal concentration of 16.3
/H9262M dye. The reaction was started by the addition of 200 /H9262l of NADH (7.09 mg
ml/H110021;ﬁnal concentration, 2 mM) and was monitored photometrically at 597 nm.
The slope of the initial linear decrease of absorption ( /H9004Amin/H110021) was used to
calculate the azoreductase activity based on the molar absorption coef ﬁcient of
Reactive Black 5 ( ε/H1100535.5 mmol/H110021cm/H110021). One nanokatal was de ﬁned as the
reduction of 1 nmol of dye per s.
The same assay was used to determine the effects of inhibitors which were
added to the phosphate buffer to give the concentrations indicated below. Dyedecolorization in the presence of FAD was measured similarly by the addition ofa 1.0 mM FAD solution to 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) to give a ﬁnal
concentration of 0.2 mM FAD in the assay.
The degradation of Mordant Black 9 and model dyes for the determination of
degradation products and substrate speci ﬁcities, respectively, was carried out as
described above, with 20 /H9262M dye and 1 mM NADH.
pH and temperature optima and stability of the azoreductase. For determi-
nation of the pH dependence of azoreductase, the buffer used for the assay wasset to pH values of 5.0 to 8.0. For pH values 8.5 and 9.0, a 50 mM Na
2CO3-
NaHCO3buffer system was used. NADH solution and dyestuff solution were
prepared with the corresponding buffers. For the determination of the temper-
ature optimum, all solutions were brought to the corresponding temperaturebefore mixing and the spectrophotometer was temperature controlled duringmeasurement.
Enzyme stability was tested at three different pH values and three different
temperatures. For this test, 1.5 ml of enzyme solution was mixed with 4.5 ml ofbuffer and incubated in a thermo-controlled water bath. Samples were takenperiodically, immediately frozen at /H1100220°C, and subsequently analyzed. Buffers
used for incubation were as follows: at pH 7.0, Na
2HPO4-KH2PO4; at pH 8.5,
NaBO3-NaOH-HCl; at pH 10.0, Na2CO3-NaHCO3.
Oxygen measurement. For determination of the oxygen dependence of the
azoreductase, a thermo-constant mini oxygen gauge (Rank Brothers Ltd.) wasused. The volume of the reaction vessel was 1.5 ml and the volumes for theazoreductase assay were adjusted accordingly. The device was calibrated with asaturated Na
2SO3solution (0% O2saturation) and by 10 min of aeration (100%
O2saturation). All reactions were carried out in 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH
7.0 at 50 °C, with 2.0 mM NADH, 0.2 mM Reactive Black 5, and 0.2 mM FAD.
Protein puri ﬁcation. The cell lysate of Bacillus strain SF was subjected to
fractionated ammonium sulfate precipitation at 40% saturation to remove im-purities, followed by 70% saturation in a second step to precipitate the azore-ductase. This was carried out by the addition of 72.6 g of (NH
4)2SO4to 300 ml
of cell lysate. The precipitated proteins after the second precipitation step were
collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was dissolved in 300 ml of phosphatebuffer (50 mM, pH 7.0). The solution was desalted by dialysis against phosphatebuffer (50 mM, pH 7.0) overnight, until a conductivity of /H1102110 mS cm
/H110021was
measured (WTW microprocessor conductivity meter LF 96). Thereafter, the
solution was concentrated by ultra ﬁltration in an Amicon stirred cell (model
8400; pressurized with N2at 2/H11003105N/m2) equipped with a cellulose-polysul -
fonate membrane with a 10-kDa cutoff.
For anion-exchange fractionation, 9.5-ml aliquots of the resulting solution
were applied to a DEAE-cellulose DE 52 column installed in an /H9004KTA fast-
performance liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Proteins were eluted at 6 ml min
/H110021with the sample buffer and a linear gradient
from 0 to 1 M NaCl. Azoreductase active fractions were pooled (approximately
50 ml) and desalted for af ﬁnity chromatography.
Two-milliliter aliquots of the sample were fractionated by af ﬁnity chromatog-
raphy through a HiTrap Blue af ﬁnity column from Amersham Pharmacia Bio-
tech. The column contained Cibacron Blue F3G-A immobilized on 6% highlycross-linked spherical agarose (Sepharose High Performance) by the triazinemethod, binding speci ﬁcally, e.g., enzymes requiring adenylyl-containing cofac-
tors (including NADH and NADPH), albumin, coagulation factors, and inter-feron. Proteins were eluted at 1 ml min
/H110021with the sample buffer and a linear
gradient from 0 t o 1 M NaCl. Fractions with azoreductase activity were pooled838 MAIER ET AL. APPL.ENVIRON .M ICROBIOL .and concentrated with Centricon 10 concentrators equipped with cellulose-poly-
sulfonate membranes with a 10-kDa cutoff.
The protein content of samples was measured by the Bradford method. Sam-
ples (160 /H9262l) were pipetted into separate microtiter plate wells, and 40 /H9262lo ft h e
reagent (obtained from Bio-Rad) per sample was added and mixed thoroughly.After 5 to 10 min of incubation at room temperature, the absorbances weremeasured. Bovine serum albumin was used for calibration.
Gel electrophoresis. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was carried
out as described previously (20), with some modi ﬁcations for native PAGE, i.e.,
both the detergent component sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 2-mercapto-ethanol ( /H9252-mercaptoethanol) were omitted. Twelve percent polyacrylamide gels
were cast, and broad-range molecular weight markers from Pharmacia were usedas standards. For activity staining, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) was mixed intothe separating gel at a concentration of 0.2% (wt/vol) to enable the dye ReactiveBlack 5 to bind to the gel. For both SDS-PAGE and native PAGE, the Coo-massie blue R-250 staining method was used. If visualization was not satisfactory,the silver staining procedure was subsequently applied.
Staining of CMC native PAGE gels was done by the following procedure.
CMC native gels were removed from the electrophoresis chamber and glassplates. The gel was immediately immersed in approximately 50 ml of 50 /H9262M
Reactive Black 5 solution for 25 min. After removal of the staining solution, thegel was put into a desiccator and a vacuum was applied. Subsequently, thedesiccator was scavenged with N
2, and a degassed NADH solution (2 mM
NADH in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) was added under the N2atmo -
sphere. To make sure that no oxygen remained in the test vessel, vacuumgeneration and N
2scavenging were repeated alternately several times. Bands of
the active enzyme appeared after approximately 10 min as white spots within a
blue background.
Isoelectric focusing was carried out as described elsewhere (14).Synthesis of model dyes. Anilines with substitutions of tri ﬂuoromethyl-, meth-
yl-, chloro-, bromo-, and ﬂuoro- groups at the o-,m-, and p- positions and
2,7-dihydroxynaphtaline-3,6-disulfonic acid disodium salt were supplied bySigma Aldrich. Urea, sodium nitrite, and sodium hydroxide were supplied by
Merck, and 32% hydrochloric acid was purchased from Riedel de Ha ¨en.
Model azo dyes were synthesized from the corresponding aromatic amines in
two steps as described elsewhere (2). Precipitation of the dyes was facilitated byacidi ﬁcation with hydrochloric acid. For puri ﬁcation, the dyes were recrystallized
from hot water and freeze-dried.
Determination of dye content. For con ﬁrmation of the purity of dyes, a method
for the determination of the dye content was developed based on the reductionof azo bonds by excesses of sodium dithionite. Five milliliters of an oxygen-freesolution of sodium dithionite (approximately 30 mM, prepared freshly every day)was mixed with 15 ml of a 100 mM formaldehyde solution to yield a more stablehydroxymethanesul ﬁnate (26) after complete conversion. This solution was ti-
trated with I
2-KI titrimetric solution (50 mM), with soluble starch as an indicator,
resulting in the consumption of about 6 ml of the solution.
For determination of the normality of the I2-KI solution, 25 g of pure KI was
dissolved in about 40 ml of deionized H2O to which was added 12.7 g of I2. The
ﬂask was closed and shaken until the iodine was completely dissolved. Only then
was the volumetric ﬂaskﬁlled up to exactly 1 liter, giving an approximate con-
centration of 0.5 M. The exact normality was determined by titration with asolution of As
2O3buffered wit h2go f sodium hydrogen-carbonate liter/H110021in
which 1 ml of the iodine solution was equivalent to 4.946 mg of As2O3.The blue
complex of iodine with starch was used to indicate the end point of the titration.
During titration, the complete conversion of Na2S2O4was only found in the
presence of an excess of the dye. However, extrapolation of the straight line of
absorbance versus concentration of Na2S2O4to an absorbance of 0.0 (complete
reduction of the dyes) gave the exact amount of dyestuff in the sample.
The molar absorption coef ﬁcients (ε) of the dyes were determined by measur-
ing the absorbance at the wavelength of maximum absorbance ( /H9261max) of each
dye. The slope of the referring trend line gives the molar absorption coef ﬁcient.
HPLC and MS analysis. FAD measurements were done based on the method
of Wahlund (34) in a Kontron 422S high-performance liquid chromatography(HPLC) apparatus equipped with a Hypersil RP 18 column with methanol-H
2O
(30:70 [vol/vol]) and 5 mmol of tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate (TBAHS)
as the mobile phase at a ﬂow rate of 1 ml min/H110021at 40 °C. FAD was detected at
260 and 450 nm ( /H9261maxof FAD) with a Kontron UV 430 detector.
Dye degradation products were separated in a Dionex HPLC system (Dionex
Corporation, Sunnyvale, Calif.) consisting of a P580 pump, an ASI-100 auto-mated sample injector, and a PDA-100 photodiode array detector. Chromato-graphic separation was performed through a Hypersil ODS 5- /H9262m (250 by 4 mm
[inside diameter]) column. The following operating conditions were used for allanalyses: injection volume, 20 /H9262l; column temperature, 40 °C; mobile phase A,100% H
2O; mobile phase B, 50% methanol –50% H2O; gradient at 0 to 20 min,
100% (A) to 50% (B); gradient at 20 to 25 min, 50% (B); gradient at 25 to 26
min, 50 to 0% (B); gradient at 26 to 35 min, 100% (A); ﬂow rate, 0.9 ml/min;
detection wavelength, 530 nm. Mass spectral (MS) analysis was performed in anSL ion trap mass spectrometer (1100 Series LC/MSD Trap; Agilent, Waldbronn,Germany) equipped with an electrospray ionization source and connected to theHPLC system described above. The spectra were recorded in negative ionizationmode. Full-scan spectra were collected from m/z 50 to 1,200, with a capillary
temperature of 350 °C. The nebulizer was set to 70.00 lb/in
2, the dry gas was set
to 12.00 liter min/H110021, and the HV capillary was set to 3,000 V. Extracted ion
chromatograms were obtained by selecting ions (M-Na) at e.g., m/z 359 for
Mordant Black 9.
RESULTS
Three Bacillus species ( Bacillus sp. strain SF, Bacillus sp.
strain LF, and B. pallidus ) isolated out of textile wastewater
drains were grown on agar plates containing dyes. Of theseorganisms, only Bacillus strain SF showed clearing zones. Next,
the strains were cultivated in liquid cultures at pH 9.5 and 65 °C
based on a yeast extract-peptone medium with dyes as the onlyadditional carbon source. Bacillus strain SF decolorized a wide
range of azo dyes at different rates (Table 1), while the otherstrains did not attack these dyes. The triarylmethane dyes BasicViolet 3 and Basic Red 9, Acid Blue 74 (indigo carmine), andthe anthraquinone dyes Acid Blue 225 and Disperse Red 86were not decolorized at all by any of the Bacillus sp. The same
substrate speci ﬁcity was observed when a cell lysate of Bacillus
strain SF was incubated with dyes in the presence of NADH,while the culture ﬁltrate and a previously puri ﬁed catalase-
peroxidase (13) did not show any decolorization activity (datanot shown). Furthermore, decolorization rates with the celllysate of Bacillus strain SF depended on the concentration of
NADH, indicating the presence of azoreductase (EC 1.7.1.6[azobenzene reductase]) activity.
Bacillus strain SF was cultivated in a 10-liter bioreactor with
a yeast extract-peptone medium, and a speci ﬁc growth rate ( /H9262)
of 0.41 h
/H110021was determined. The production of azoreductase
was coupled to growth, and both parameters reached a maxi-
mum at aroun d 6 h (Fig. 1). For subsequent fermentations,
cells were harvested after this phase and downstream process-ing yielded about 300 ml of cell lysate.
For all tested dyes, decolorization by the cell lysate of Ba-
cillus strain SF in the presence of NADH started with a slow
linear fading of color followed by rapid decolorization after

840about 150 s (Fig. 2a). There was a linear dependence of the
azoreductase activity and NADH concentration up to about1.5 mM (Fig. 2b). Above this concentration, further addition ofNADH did not increase the reaction velocity. At a constantconcentration of NADH, the duration of the delay of decol-orization depended on the amount of cell lysate used (Fig. 2a).These ﬁndings led to the assumption that a certain amount of
NADH was consumed by another reaction and only thereafterwas NADH available for dye decolorization. This hypothesiswas con ﬁrmed by the fact that rapid decolorization started
immediately when the cell lysate was preincubated withNADH for 5 min before the addition of the dye (Fig. 2, inset).Obviously, the second reaction consuming NADH was depen-dent on the presence of oxygen, since the delay was not ob-served when all solutions were degassed with N
2. This fact was
conﬁrmed by monitoring of the concentration of oxygen during
decolorization of Reactive Black 5 (Fig. 3).
Based on these results, an assay was developed for the mon-
itoring of azoreductase activity during enzyme puri ﬁcation.
Samples were diluted to achieve a decolorization rate between0.1 and 0.3 /H9004Amin
/H110021, a range for which a linear dependence
between cell lysate concentrations was found. In addition, a
new method for the detection of azoreductase in polyacryl-amide gels was developed. This assay was based on the decol-orization of the dye Reactive Black 5, which was incorporatedinto the gels bound to CMC as a carrier. The most importantstep in the development of this method was to ensure anoxygen-free atmosphere. With this method, two white bandswere detected on the gel for the cell lysate, indicating thepresence of azoreductase activity. Bands 1 and 2 were cut outand the eluted samples were reapplied to an SDS gel (Fig. 4),resulting in a single band for band 1, of about 62 kDa, and apattern of at least six bands for band 2, including a band of 62kDa. This 62-kDa protein with azoreductase activity was cho-sen for puri ﬁcation.
In the ﬁrst step, the azoreductase was subjected to fraction-ated ammonium sulfate precipitation at 40 and 60% satura-
tion. The sample resulting from precipitation was desalted byrepeated ulfra ﬁltration and was fractionated by anion-ex-
change chromatography with a DEAE column. A puri ﬁcation
factor of 20.2 was achieved with this puri ﬁcation step (Table 2),
and the azoreductase was the most prominent band on SDSgels. Since size exclusion chromatography did not give satis-factory results for further puri ﬁcation of the enzyme, af ﬁnity
chromatography was used. A column with Cibacron BlueF3G-A immobilized on spherical agarose with an af ﬁnity to,
e.g., enzymes requiring adenylyl-containing cofactors (includ-ing NADH and NADPH), was used for the ﬁnal puri ﬁcation
step of the azoreductase. In contrast to many reports for which

Characterization of the azoreductase of Bacillus strain SF.
The resulting pure protein had a molecular mass of 61.6 /H110061.4
kDa, as calculated from SDS gels (Fig. 4). The isoelectric pointof the azoreductase was measured to be at pH 5.3. The pHoptimum of the azoreductase was determined with four differ-ent azo dyes by measuring the activity within the range of pHvalues 5.0 to 9.0. An optimum at pH 7.0 was found for MordantBlack 9, Mordant Brown 96, and Reactive Black 5, while forDirect Blue 71 the maximum activity was measured at pH 8.0.The azoreductase activity increased almost linearly in the tem-perature range from 20 to 45 °C. Thereafter, the activity slightly
increased, reaching its optimum at 80 °C. The enzyme was quite
stable at pH 7 and 50 °C, with a half-life of 1 day, while the
stability decreased signi ﬁcantly at 60 °C to a half-life of 3 h.
However, at this temperature and pH 10, the half-life was still1 h, while it was 7.6 h at this pH and 30 °C.
Fifty percent inhibition of the azoreductase was detected
with 0.08% SDS and 2.2 /H9262M KCN. Inhibitors of the electron
transport chain in cells, including rotenone, antimycin A, andNaN
3, did not show any effect up to concentrations of 500 mg
liter/H110021. Preincubation of the reaction mixture with CO did not
have any effect on the decolorization rate either.
Substrate speci ﬁcity of the azoreductase from Bacillus strain
SF.A linear correlation between azoreductase activity and the
concentration of Reactive Black 5 up to 13.5 /H9262M was observedwhen NADH was provided in excess ( k/H110052.56/H1100310/H110022s/H110021).
Under aerobic conditions, azoreductase activity increased
/H1102210-fold, from 5.8 /H11003102to 6.7/H11003103nkat ml/H110021, upon addition
of 0.25 mM FAD, while only a small increase, to 8.4 /H11003103nkat
ml/H110021, was measured when the concentration of FAD was
raised to 0.5 mM. By using HPLC, we determined the concen-
tration of FAD in the assay to be 0.29 /H110060.02 mM and 0.31 /H11006
0.01 mM before and after the reaction, respectively, indicatingthat FAD was not consumed during the reaction with NADH,but acted as a mediator.
While samples were in the presence of oxygen, no decolor-
ization was seen for samples containing NADH, FAD, andvarious dyes, but the same samples were decolorized in theabsence of oxygen at similar rates by high concentrations ofFAD or by the azoreductase, except for Direct Blue 71, whichwas degraded faster by FAD (Table 3).
The degradation of the mono-azo dye Mordant Black 9 by
the azoreductase from Bacillus strain SF was monitored both
spectrophotometrically and by HPLC-MS. After complete de-colorization of the dye, the corresponding amines obviouslyformed degradation products. After separation of the twoproducts and the cofactor by HPLC, two peaks were identi ﬁed
by coupled MS as 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonicacid ([M-2H]
/H11002, 187.6 m/z) and NADH ([M-2Na-H]/H11002, 662.0 m/z), while
1-amino-3,7-dihydroxynaphthalene was not detectable by this
MS method.
Various model dyes with different substituents (R1-, R2-, and
R3-) in the ortho ,meta , and para positions of the benzyl ring
were synthesized (Fig. 5). The o-ﬂuorinated isomer was miss-
ing from the series since it was not stable in an aqueous solu-tion. After dissolving of the isomer, the reddish-brown solutionturned black within a few minutes and a precipitate wasformed. After preparation of the dyes, the molar extinction

stituents were clearly degraded fastest. As for many othercompounds, dyes with a substituent in the ortho position were
degraded faster than those with a substituent in the para po-
sition (Table 4). In comparison to a dye without any substitu-tions, the methylated dyes showed the same or, in the case ofthem-methyl dye, lower degradation rates.
DISCUSSION
The newly isolated alkali-thermophilic Bacillus sp. strain SF
decolorizes a number of azo dyes. This activity, however, can-not be attributed to the catalase-peroxidase previously isolatedfrom this organism, which did not attack any of the tested dyes(13). An intracellular azoreductase (EC 1.7.1.6 [azobenzenereductase]) is responsible for the decolorization activity, aspreviously shown for other azo-dye-degrading microorganisms(11, 31, 36). Two bands showing azoreductase activity werefound after separation of the cell lysate from Bacillus strain SF
in gels combined with activity staining. A new method foractivity staining was developed since a previously describedprocedure by Zimmermann et al. (39) had failed for this or-ganism. CMC was included in the gel as a carrier for dyes,which were decolorized by active protein bands under an oxy-gen-free atmosphere.
In general, azoreductase activity was only measured in the
absence of oxygen. Interestingly, prior to dye decolorization oxy-gen was consumed in solutions containing NADH, azoreduc-tase, and a dye. Similarly, other authors (10) reported that azo-reductase activity was only observed in oxygen-free solutions(7). Chang et al. mentioned a direct in ﬂuence of oxygen on the
degradation rates of azo dyes by Pseudomonas luteola , although
they did not measure any in ﬂuence with the crude cell extract.
The azoreductase from Bacillus strain SF was puri ﬁed by
a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation, anion-ex-change chromatography, and af ﬁnity chromatography to an
overall puri ﬁcation level of 250-fold. Zimmermann et al. (38)
reported an 80-fold puri ﬁcation with a 17% yield for the azore-
ductase from Pseudomonas sp., indicating a higher enzyme
concentration in the cell lysate but a lower speci ﬁc activity thantheBacillus strain SF azoreductase (50 nkat mg
/H110021compared to
5/H11003103nkat mg/H110021). However, a comparison of activity values
from the literature is dif ﬁcult since most studies are based on
the decolorization of different dyes.
The application of af ﬁnity chromatography for the puri ﬁca-
tion of azoreductase has previously been described (24, 25, 33,39). Compared to previous reports (25), for which a 55-foldpuriﬁcation was achieved with this technique, only a 5-fold
puriﬁcation was calculated for the azoreductase from Bacillus
strain SF, probably due to denaturation and/or irreversibleadsorption of the enzyme in the Cibacron Blue F3G-A column.A clear separation of azoreductase was reported for a RedSepharose CL-6B column (33).
The molecular mass of the azoreductase from Bacillus strain
SF was determined to be 61.6 /H110061.4 kDa, and a pI of 5.3 was
measured. Previously, molecular masses of 21 and 30 kDa werereported for azoreductases from Pseudomonas sp. (38, 39) and
a mass of 28 kDa was reported for Enterobacter agglomerans
(24). Temperature optima for azoreductases reported in theliterature range from 40 to 45 °C (15, 22). In this work, for the
ﬁrst time, an azoreductase from an alkali-thermophilic bacte-
rium was investigated, and this azoreductase from Bacillus
strain SF had a temperature optimum at 80 °C. Like its cata-
lase-peroxidase (27), the azoreductase of Bacillus strain SF had
a pH optimum at pH 7, although the organism had a growthoptimum above pH 9. Interestingly, the half-lives of the azore-ductase from Bacillus strain SF under different conditions were
shorter than those determined for the catalase-peroxidase pre-viously isolated from this organism. The half-life of the cata-lase-peroxidase at pH 7.0 was /H11022200 h, while the azoreductase
showed a half-life of only 24 h.
The azoreductase from Bacillus strain SF was inhibited by
CN
/H11002and by SDS, as was previously shown for an azoreductase
from Bacillus cereus (22). CO did not affect azoreductase ac-
tivity, which contradicts with previously obtained results (10).Similarly, other typical inhibitors of respiration chain enzymes,such as rotenone, antimycin A, and N
3/H11002, did not have any
effect on the azoreductase, indicating that this enzyme is not
part of the respiration chain.
Several authors reporting on azoreductases claimed that
FAD enhances azo bond reduction (10, 21, 22). With the pres-
ent work, we found that under anaerobic conditions, somereduction of azo dyes takes place in the presence of FAD andNADH without enzyme. This reaction started when dissolvedoxygen was completely removed from the solution. Severalauthors (10, 21, 22) reported that the addition of FAD in cat-alytic amounts increased azoreductase activity due to its elec-tron-mediating function. Furthermore, it was suggested thatthe enzyme itself contained a ﬂavine prosthetic group (22), and
it was assumed that FAD as a mediator was not degraded and/or metabolized during the reaction (25). By using HPLC anal-ysis, we con ﬁrmed that FAD was not consumed during decol-
orization of dyes by the azoreductase from Bacillus strain SF.
Surprisingly, in the presence of NADH, Direct Blue 71 was
decolorized much faster by FAD than by the enzyme alone.Compared to all the other dyes used for this study, this dye wasprobably too big to enter the active site of the enzyme. Thisobservation is in contrast to previous observations (10) whichdid not measure any dye decolorization by NADH and FAD.Oxygen probably had not been completely removed from theTABLE 4.

essential for any reaction to take place.
We observed a linear dependency between the concentra-
tion of Reactive Black 5 up to 13.5 /H9262M and the decolorization
rate of azoreductase from Bacillus strain SF, while other
groups (21, 38) reported substrate saturation kinetics for thisconcentration range and other azoreductases. The substratespeci ﬁcity was tested with 15 newly synthesized azo dyes, and
dyes with NO
2substituents showed the highest decolorization
rates. As for several other substituents, a stronger in ﬂuence
was seen with the substituent in the ortho position than in the
para position. In comparison to a dye without substitutions, the
methylated dyes showed the same or, in the case of the m-
methyl dye, lower decolorization rates. Substitution with elec-tron-withdrawing groups, especially in the ortho position, clearly
enhanced decolorization rates. A comparison of the degrad-abilities of dyes with p-methyl, p-bromine, p-ﬂuorine, and p-
CF
3substituents revealed increased rates with stronger elec -
tronegative substituents. Electron-withdrawing groups mightlead to a decreased electron density at the N AN double bond
(especially with ortho and para substituents). Hence, electron
transfer to these groups is relieved. In addition, the transfer ofelectrons to the dye molecule leads to a negatively chargedintermediate, which might be stabilized by more electronega-tive substituents. This hypothesis would also explain the veryhigh reactivities of the dye molecules with nitro substituents. In
addition to the /H11002I effect, the NO
2group also causes a very
strong /H11001M effect, stabilizing the intermediately occurring neg-
ative charge by mesomeric stabilization.
In summary, we have shown that an azoreductase is respon-
sible for azo dye reduction by Bacillus strain SF. Future investi-
gations should focus on the application of this highly alkali-ther-
mostable organism for the treatment of textile dyeing ef ﬂuents.
