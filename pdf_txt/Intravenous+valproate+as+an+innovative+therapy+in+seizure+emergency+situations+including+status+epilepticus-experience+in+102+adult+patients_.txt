Introduction
Valproate (VPA) is a well established ﬁrst-line anti-
epileptic drug (AED) effective in a wide range offocal and generalized seizures.

Antiepileptic therapySummary
Purpose: The emergency treatment of seizures is an important practical issue, in
particular the therapy of status epilepticus. Antiepileptic drugs for this conditionshould be easy to use, show rapid action, have a long-lasting antiepileptic effect, and
have minimal cardiopulmonary and other side-effects. Unfortunately, none of the
presently available medications such as phenytoin and barbiturates seems to have allof these four properties. Intravenous valproate became available some years ago and
ﬁrst experiences show promising safety data and efﬁcacy results.
Methods: We report a series of 102 adult patients who received standardized high
dosage intravenous valproate in various emergency situations, including status
epilepticus. The therapeutic goal was persistent seizure control, deﬁned as successful
interruption of clinical seizure activity within less than 15 min, followed by seizurefreedom during intravenous therapy for at least 12 h. All side effects were docu-mented.
Results: In 83/97 patients (85.6%) the therapeutic goal was achieved. Serious side
effects were not documented in any patient. In particular there was no evidence ofsedation, cardiorespiratory disturbances and hypotension as often seen in barbitu-
rates and phenytoin. Mild side effects occurred in seven cases (6.9%).
Conclusions: The intravenous application of VPA seems to be an easy-to-use, safe and
efﬁcient formulation as an alternative to phenytoin in all seizure emergency situa-
tions including status epilepticus. Further controlled comparison studies have to be
performed in the future.#2005 BEA Trading Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

provided by Elsevier - Publisher Connector an AED is necessary, either because the patient is
unable to take oral medication or because a rapidloading is required, e.g. in status epilepticus (SE).Beside short-acting benzodiazepines, only pheny-toin and phenobarbital are in wide use as an intra-venous preparation. Unfortunately, these have anarrow therapeutic window and a range of compli-cating side effects signi ﬁcantly limiting their prac-
tical administration. Phenobarbital may lead to
major sedation and respiratory problems includingapnoea and is reported to increase the risk of infec-tions. Phenytoin can cause cardiac arrhythmias,requires an extra intravenous-line, has to be givenvery slowly and may induce severe problems at theinjection site including the ‘‘purple glove syn-
drome ’’.
Since the autumn of 1996, intravenous VPA is
available in Germany. The reported experiencesdemonstrate a broad spectrum of indications ran-ging from a rapid switch of oral to parenteral appli-cation (e.g. children with severe gastroenteritis), toseries of seizures and life-threatening grand-mal SEwith promising safety data and ef ﬁcacy results.

Experimental data supported this clinical observa-
tions revealing both a fast and long-lasting antisei-
zure effect for VPA.7
Therefore, the goals of this retro- and prospec-
tive study were to test, (1) if intravenous VPA is asafe and ef ﬁcient treatment in heterogeneous con-
ditions of seizure activity including SE, and (2) ifthese preliminary ﬁndings deliver promising results
for further controlled clinical trials.
Methods
Patients
Data were available for 102 patients treated duringa 4-year period between December 1996 and
December 2000. Sixty-one patients (59.8%) were
male, 41 female (40.2%). The mean age was 54.8years, range 18 —85 years. The data of all patients
originated from a retrospective chart review. In 24patients additional data from a prospective applica-tion survey was available, 21 patients were super-vised during treatment by the authors with regard tothis study.
Indication for rapid intravenous VPA treatment
ranged from (1) urgent need for or switch to intra-venous VPA ( n= 25), (2) series of seizures, ( n= 34),
(3) status epilepticus in n= 35, to (4) others ( n=8 )
such as brainstem seizures ( n= 1), posthypoxic myo-
clonia ( n= 2), and probably non-epileptic seizure
episodes ( n= 5). These ﬁve patients were excluded
from the ef ﬁcacy analysis. SE was operationallydeﬁned according to the most recent classi ﬁcation
as ongoing seizure activity for more than 10 min.
8
Series of seizures were de ﬁned as two or more
distinct seizures within 24 h with interseizure inter-
vals of regaining either consciousness or relatedfunctions. For an exact overview see Table 1 .
Procedures
All patients were either admitted as emergency
cases or were already hospitalized. Intravenous
VPA therapy was always applied under supervision
of an experienced epileptologist (BP or CP). Routineclinical laboratory tests including electrolytes,blood cell count, coagulation parameters, liverenzymes and kidney function were conducted inall patients, AED levels were measured in 97 of102 patients. EEG (21-channel surface, Nihon Koh-den Co.) was performed in all 35 SE patients and in
85 patients out of all 102 patients.
The patients received commercially available
intravenous VPA (Or ﬁril
1Injektionslo ¨sung, Desitin,
Germany). The initial bolus application variedbetween 4 and 16 mg/kg BW (body weight) depen-dent on the severity of the clinical condition withthe majority (74%) of patients receiving 15 and16 mg/kg BW, given within 5 —10 min, followed by
a continuous infusion ( ﬂow control pump) of 0.5 —
4 mg/kg BW/h maintenance dosage within 2 h to 10days.
Precise data of individual dosage is given for all
35 patients being diagnosed with SE ( Table 2 ).

We analyzed ef ﬁcacy and side effects of intravenous
VPA. Primary outcome was de ﬁned as successful
interruption of clinical seizure activity within lessthan 15 min, followed by seizure freedom duringintravenous therapy for at least 12 h in thosepatients with SE. In those patients with series of
seizures or those undergoing medication changes,
the goal was seizure freedom during intravenoustherapy for at least 12 h. All patients were askedif they experienced or had experienced any pro-blems, which they thought were attributable totheir medication. All individual adverse events weredocumented and analyzed.
Results
Tolerability and safety
Serious side effects were not documented in any
patient. In none of the 35 SE patients and in none ofthe 34 patients with series of seizures were signi ﬁ-
cant cardiorespiratory side effects including hypo-
tension observed.
Mild side effects, reported by individuals being
conscious, occurred in 7 out of 102 applications(6.8%): Three patients complained of an unspeci ﬁc
feeling of warming with dizziness for some secondsduring fast bolus injection. One patient had to bewithdrawn because of a moderate generalized aller-
gic skin reaction, which disappeared within a few
hours after discontinuation of therapy. Anotherpatient had nausea and vomiting for 3 h whichstopped despite of continuation of the therapyand one patient had mild fatigue. In one patientwe observed a transient tremor of both hands. Therewere no reactions at the injection site.
Efﬁcacy
Ninety-seven of the 102 patients were eligible forefﬁcacy analysis, as ﬁve patients had to be excluded
retrospectively because of the non-epileptic natureof their seizures. In 83 of 97 patients (85.6%) theprimary outcome criterion of seizure freedom asdeﬁned was achieved. Sub-group analysis showed
efﬁcacy of intravenous VPA in 27 out of 35 patients
with SE (77.1%), in 29 out of 34 patients with seriesof seizures (85.3%), and in all but one out of 25patients who were switched to intravenous treat-ment (96.0%), which is illustrated in Fig. 1 . In the
last group of patients, two were seizure free, theothers had had seizures before the switch. Withinthe SE group, patients with complex-partial SEresponded best (92.9% or 13/14 patients seizure
free), compared to simple-partial SE (83.3% or10/12 seizure free), generalized tonic —clonic
(GTC) SE (66.7% or 4/6 patients) and atypicalabsence-status (0/3).
Looking at the 14 cases with primary treatment
failure, the following three subgroups can be recog-nized:
1.Late responders :I n ﬁve patients VPA was ef ﬁ-
cient, but only after a delay. In three out of those(two with a series of GTC, one with intravenousVPA substitution) a GTC seizure recurred within
15 min: increased dosage of VPA ﬁnally led to
complete seizure freedom. In the remaining twoa simple-partial SE required the administrationof an additional bolus of 12 mg/kg BW VPA toachieve complete seizure control.
2.Highly drug resistant SE : Of these seven patients,
ﬁve were absolutely refractory to any AED treat-
ment: T wo died still in SE due to their underlying
illness, two had an absolutely pharmacoresistant
SE (complex-partial and generalized tonic —clo-
nic, respectively) to any drug treatment lastingfor months and died later , one was dischargedwhile still having an intermittent atypicalabsence-status and was lost to follow-up. Ofthe other two patients, one had a complex-par-tial SE due to a ganglioglioma and the other
simple-partial SE due to a brain abscess. Both
patients became seizure-free after surgicaltreatment.
3.Responders to other AEDs than VPA : Only two
patients were in this group. One patient had anatypical absence-status, promptly reacting tobenzodiazepines, the other one had severalGTC seizures which got controlled by high dosage
of VPA, however , ending into a complex-partialIntravenous valproate in seizure emergency situations 167

dard dosis of intravenous phenytoin.
T wenty-nine patients had received benzodiaze-
pines or intravenous phenytoin in standard adultdosages
8without success before treatment with i-
ntravenous VPA. Five of these were refractory to
benzodiazepines and intravenous phenytoin in a
maximum dose and became seizure-free under in-travenous VPA.
Discussion
The emergency treatment of seizures is an impor-tant practical issue. This is particularly true for SE,
where the mortality rates may be still as high as 25%.
Early aggressive treatment seems to be absolutelynecessary in this life-threatening condition. The AEDshould ideally ful ﬁll the following criteria: (1) be
easy to use, (2) show rapid action, (3) have a long-lasting antiepileptic effect, (4) ﬁnally, have minimal
cardiopulmonary and other side-effects. Unfortu-nately, none of the presently available medications
such as phenytoin and barbiturates seems to have all
of these four properties.

In our opinion, intravenous VPA might be an
interesting alternative in this context for severalreasons. It is well known to have a variety of actionsites in the experimental setting
10explaining its
excellent ef ﬁcacy in most seizure types. In an elec-
trically induced SE-model in animals, VPA sup-
pressed seizure activity after 30 s,7being faster
than diazepam and phenytoin, both of which showedmore prominent sedation.
The history of intravenous application of VPA in
patients is a fairly recent one. Since the ﬁrst obser-
vations of its high ef ﬁcacy combined with excellent
safety data in a small study group of patients with SEby Price
3, a few uncontrolled open studies fol-
lowed,4,5,2,6all of them con ﬁrming the therapeutic
value of this new formulation.
Our own preliminary data have shown its good
antiepileptic effects both in a series of seizures andin different kinds of SE including GTCS-SE, with asuccess rate of approximately 80%. Interestingly,intravenous VPA could terminate seizure activityin most of the cases where different established
AEDs (benzodiazepines and intravenous phenytoin)
had previously failed. Our ef ﬁcacy rates of up to 80%
and more correspond to other recent studies inadults
2—5and children,6where most patients had
also been pretreated unsuccessfully with standardbenzodiazepines. Treatment failure in our studypopulation mainly occurred in those individuals,who were either refractory with any AED, had anunderlying life-threatening condition or revealed a
highly epileptogenic lesion such as a brain abscess.Only two patients showed seizure control after aswitch to an alternative medication.
In the two small adult case series
5,4(n= 20 and
23, respectively), a treatment regimen with aninitial bolus treatment of 15 mg/kg BW and a sub-sequent infusion with 1 mg/kg BW/h of either 5 —
6h
5or 24 h,4interrupted on-going SE in 80 —85% of
cases controlled by EEG-monitoring in one study.4
Major systemic side effects were not observed ineither study. Ueberall et al.
6treated 41 children in
SE, who had been refractory to benzodiazepines,phenytoin and barbiturates before, by means ofintravenous VPA, using an initial bolus of 20 —
40 mg/kg BW, followed by an infusion with 5 mg/
kg BW/h. SE could be successfully interrupted in 78%
(32 out of 41) of the children, in the majority(n= 27) within 2 —6 min. Seizure control was
assessed by EEG-monitoring in all patients.
There were no major safety problems in our
entire study group of 102 patients with a widespectrum of therapeutic indications. This is in per-fect agreement with all above mentioned ef ﬁcacy
studies, even in studies where very high dosages of
up to 9.6 g/d were applied,
3and with those studies,
in which the safety aspect of intravenous VPA wasparticularly addressed.
9,10Due to the mainly retro-
spective character of our study, we might havemissed some minor side effects, which may not havebeen documented in the charts but there haveclearly been no serious adverse events.
More recent experiences with high bolus applica-
tion of intravenous VPA with up to 40 mg/kg BWand rapid loading with a rate of up to 6 mg/kg BW/min
11—14demonstrate both excellent ef ﬁcacy and
safety. The two manufacturers in Germany nowrecommend an initial loading dose of 15 mg/kg BWover a time period of up to 30 min followed by aninfusion at 1 —2 mg/kg BW/h over 12 —24 h, which is
close to the regimen we used in our study. Meanwhile
we have administered dosages of 4800 mg up to9600 mg over 24 h in cases of SE that were dif ﬁcult
to treat, without any evidence of severe side effects.
The above reported high ef ﬁcacy rates of >80%
including our own experience are very promising, buthave to be interpreted with caution, as they are stillresults from open study designs, or retrospective
small case series.
15It is also dif ﬁcult to compare them
with other data, as most publications with regard toanyantiepileptictreatmentinSEareeitheranecdotalcase reports or open studies with only a small numberof patients. Systematic prospective comparisons ofdifferent AEDs, randomized and double-blind, areextremely rare:to ourknowledgethere are only threestudies,
16—18and only one with a larger population.18168 C.N.A. Peters, B. Pohlmann-EdenIn this prospective multi-centre, double-blinded
comparison study, 570 patients randomly receiveddifferent therapeutic regimens (phenytoin, diaze-pam + phenytoin, phenobarbital and ﬁnally loraze-
pam), but unfortunately VPA was not included. Thereported low ef ﬁcacy rate of only 55% in this study,
independent of the chosen drug, is mainly due tothe selection of patients in this study and the long
duration of the SE before recruitment.
18
Against this background it now seems necessary
to perform a controlled randomized double-blindtrial in SE to compare the ef ﬁcacy and tolerability of
intravenous VPA with phenytoin or fosphenytoin.Several open questions, such as loading and main-tenance dosis, target groups and time point ofapplication in a new decision algorithmus for SE
have to be addressed in the future.
In conclusion, the intravenous application of VPA
seems to be a highly ef ﬁcient and safe treatment in
many seizure emergency situations including SE. Ourdata strongly support that the pro ﬁle of VPA includes a
fast action beside the well known slow-actingmechanisms.
19It can have an effect even in cases
when other ﬁrst-line AEDs have failed, but shows a
signi ﬁcantlybettertolerability,iseasiertohandleand
can be switched directly to a long-term antiepileptictherapy of ﬁrst choice. Further controlled comparison
studies have to be performed in the future.
