1. Introduction  
    The textile industries are recognized as the main 
industry to use a great  amount of water and 
synthetic dyes which ends in generating a high 
volume of colorful wastewater [1-3]. It is stated 
that 1000000 kg/yr of dyes is discharged into the 
effluents by textile industries  [4]. The synthetic  
 
 dyes are classified as anionic, c ationic and 
nonionic (in which the acid replaces anionic dye 
group)  [2]. The toxicity and harmful impacts of 
the dyes have been confirmed by many studies 
conducted throughout the world  [5]. The dyes can 
threaten the human health by their carcinogenic

Backgr ound:  Recently, there has been a great concern about the consumption of 
dyes because of their toxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and persistence in the 
aquatic environment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the feasibility 
of using Le mna minor for Acid Blue 292 (AB292) dye removal from aqueous 
solution and to determine the optimal conditions.  
Methods: This experimental study was conducted in the batch systems to investigate 
the effects of parameters such as contact time, initial concen tration of dye, pH and 
Lemna minor biomass dose. Isotherms and kinetic studies of dye adsorption were 
performed using equilibrium data.  
Results:  According to the results, a maximum removal efficiency of 98.5% was 
obtained at pH of 3 and the contact time of  90 min; initial dye concentration 10 mg/L 
and adsorbent dose 3g/L.  The adsorption data was best fitted to the Langmuir 
isotherm and pseudo -second order kinetic model.  
Conclusion: The results showed that Lemna minor could be used as a cost -effective 
adsorb ent for removing AB292 dye from textile wastewater efficiently.

be influenced by the blocking of sunlight 
penetration and the reduction of oxygen in water 
bodies  [6-8].  
    Since the textile dyes have complex aromatic 
structure, they are resistant against the 
convent ional biological treatment methods 
indicating the necessity to use the effective and 
promising methods to remove these dyes  [9-10].  
    The previous studies have indicated that the 
adsorption onto activated carbon is a reliable,  
inexpensive and significan tly effective technique 
to remove the dyes; however, the high cost of 
activated carbon limits its use [11-14]. 
    In the recent decades, various materials such as 
Azolla, fly ash, wheat straw, apple pomace, fungi, 
orange peels, soy meal hull, eggshell, an d etchas 
have been applied to develop low -cost and 
effective adsorbents  [15-17]. Lemna minor is one 
of wide -spread aquatic plants, which is classified 
as duckweed species group, with special 
characteristics including rapid growth, high 
nutritional value, a nd high water purification 
capabilities, also used to remove the pollutants 
from water and wastewater. A number of studies 
have been conducted by the scientists to  remove 
the heavy metals, dyes, etc by  Lemna minor  [18-
20]. 
    Therefore, the purpose of the  present study was 
to assess Lemna minor capability to remove the 
AB292 dye. Also, the effects of several parameters 
including contact time, pH, adsorbent dose and 
initial dye concentration were investigated.  
 
2. Material s and Methods  
2.1. Chemicals and ex periments  
All chemicals used in this work were of GR  grade 
obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). The 
chemical structure of Azo Dye Acid Blue 292 
(molecular weight: 616.49and Molecular Formula 
C22H14N6Na2O9S2 and CAS Number:  5850 -35-1) 
is shown in Fig. 1. The pH of the solution was 
adjusted by 0.1M H 2SO 4 or NaOH. All experiments were conducted in batch mode in 250 
mL conical flasks.  
 
 
 
 
 
2.2. Preparation of adsorbent  
    The Lemna minor biomass was collected from 
the wetlands of Sari, Iran. It was sun d ried and 
then crushed and sieved to 1 -2 mm particle sizes. 
Then the biomass was treated with 0.1 M HCl for 
5 hr, followed by washing with distilled water and 
drying [17]. The prepared adsorbent was stored to 
use in experiments. The BET -N2 method using an 
ASAP 2000 apparatus - based nitrogen adsorption –
desorption isotherms at 77K was applied to 
determine the specific surface area of the resultant 
adsorbent. The surface morphology of adsorbent 
was observed with a Philips XL30 scanning 
electron microscope (SEM)  before and the after 
adsorption process.  
 2.3. Sorption studies       
    Adsorption experiments were carried out by 
agitating 0.3 g of adsorbent with 100 ml of desired 
concentration of AB292 dye solution in a thermo  
stated rotary shaker (ORBITEK, Chennai,  India) 
at 200 rpm and 25oC in various contact times (10, 
20, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min). Dye 
concentration was estimated by monitoring the 
absorbance at 632 nm using a UV -vis 
spectrophotometer (DR -5000). PH was measured 
using a pH meter (30 0 Hanna Instrument, USA). 
The samples were removed from the shaker at 
predetermined time intervals and the dye solution 
was separated from the adsorbent by 
centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The 
absorbance of supernatant solution was measured. 
The effe ct of pH on the adsorption of  AB 292 dye 
was studied by conducting equilibrium sorption 
tests at different pH values [3-11] using  3 g of 
powdered biomass for 90 min.

Balarak  D et al/ J. Hum. Environ. Health Promot. 2016; 2(1) :9- 19      The pH was adjusted by using dilute NaOH and 
HCl solutions. Effect of adsorbent dosag e was 
studied with different  adsorbent doses (0.5 -5 g/L) 
and 100 ml of 100 mg/L AB  292 dye solutions at 
equilibrium time and pH 3. The experiments were 
carried out using3 g of biomass for 90 min. 
Langmuir,  Freundlich and Temkin isotherms were 
employed to s tudy the adsorption capacity of the 
adsorbent.  The amount of AB  292 dye adsorbed by 
biomass was calculated from the differences 
between the amount added to the biomass and the 
dye content after adsorption using the following 
equation [21-23]: 
=eq 
and Ce  0 Where qe is the dye uptake (mg/g), C    
are the initial and final dye concentrations in the 
solution respectively (mg/L), V, the solution 
volume (L) and M is the mass of biosorbent (g). 
3. Results and Discussion  
3.1.  Adsorption characterizatio n 
    Figures 2a and b show the SEM images of 
adsorbent in both before and after use. The SEM 
images show the texture and porosity of adsorbent.  
    The difference between the adsorbent surfaces 
can be concluded by the comparison of the 
images. Before th e use of adsorbent, the porous 
surface of adsorbent was obvious, however, they  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 are saturated and unclear after using the adsorption 
experiments. Also, the specific surface area was 
30 m2/g which was greater than the surface of 
adsorbents probabl y due to potent and effective 
adsorbent.  
3.2. Effect of pH  
    The effect of pH for the adsorption of AB292 
dye onto Lemna minor is shown in Fig. 3. It can 
be seen that the adsorption of AB292 dye was pH -
dependent. The results show that the amount of 
adsor bed dye onto Lemna minor decreases a s the 
pH increases from 3 to 11 . 
3.3. Effect of Contact Time and Initial 
Concentration of AB292   
    The experiments to study the effect of contact 
time were carried out in various concentrations of 
AB292dye at constant value of pH=3, and the 
results are shown in Fig. 4. As seen in Fig. 4, the 
removal efficiency of AB292 increased with time 
until reaching an equilibrium constant value after 
90 min for all concentrations  . 
    The percentage removal efficiency for AB292 
dye decreased with increasing AB292 dye 
concentration in the aqueous solutions.  Thus, in 
the concentration of 10 mg/L the highest 
adsorption percentage was observed and with 
increasing the concentration amount from 10 to 
200 mg/L, adsorption percentage decre ased from 
98.9% to 74.4%.

Balarak  D et al/ J. Hum. Enviro n. Health Promot. 2016; 2(1):9 - 19 3.4. Effect of Lemna minor dosage on the 
adsorp tion capability  
    The effect of biomass dosage on removal rate of 
AB292dye was investigated in different activated 
carbon doses (0.5 -5 g/L), while other parameters 
were  kept constant. As can be seen from Fig. 5, 
the adsorption capability and the adsorption rate 
dramatically increased with the amount of biomass 
used.  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
3.5. Adsorption isotherm  
    The existence of adsorbate equilib rium between 
the liquid and solid phase is well described by 
adsorption isotherms. Experimental isotherm data 
were fitted on Langmuir,  Freundlich, and Temkin 
adsorption isotherm models.  The Langmuir 
isotherm can be expressed as [24, 25]. 
 = 
 + 
  
    Where q m is a constant related to adsorption 
capacity (mg/g) and KL is Langmuir constant 
related to energy of adsorption (L/mg). The 
constants q m and KL can be calculated from the 
slope and intercept of the plot of C e/qe vs C e. 
    The Langmuir plot of C e/qe vs Ceis shown in 
Fig. 5. The results calculated from the plot are 
given in Table 1. The Langmuir adsorption 
capacity was determined to be 29.25 mg/g. The 
essential characteristics of Langmuir isotherm can 
be expressed by d imensionless separation factor, 
RL. 
    The value of separation factor RL indicates the  
nature of the adsorption process as given below  
 [26, 27]:

    Where K L is the Langmuir constant and C 0 is 
the initial concentration (mg/L). The R L value was 
obtained to be 0.554 which was between 0 and 1 
indicating the favorable adsorption process.  
Freundlich model  is the most popular model for a 
single solute system, based  on the distribution of 
solute between the solid phase and aqueous phase 
at equilibrium. The Freundlich equation is 
expressed as [28, 29]: 
Ln q e = ln K F + 
ln C e 
    Where K F is the measure of adsorption capacity 
and n is the adsorption intensi ty: 
    A plot of log q e vs log C e gives a linear trace 
with a slope of 1/n and intercept of log K F. The 
values of 1/n and K F are given in Table1 (Fig not 
shown). When 1/n is >1.0, the change in adsorbed 
dye concentration is greater than the change in the 
dye concentration in solution . The Temkin 
isotherm is applied in the following form [30, 31]: 
qe = 
 ln (Kt) + 
 ln(C e) 
    Where b is the Temkin constant related to heat 
of sorption  (J/mg) and Kt the equilibrium binding 
constant co rresponding to the  maximum binding 
energy (L/g).  
    The Temkin constants K t and b are calculated 
from the slopes and intercepts of q e vs ln  Ce are 
given in Table 1 (Fig not shown). Out of three 
isotherm models studied for this adsorbent -
adsorbate sy stem, Langmuir model shows the best 
fit with a correlation coefficient of 0.995.  
3.6. Kinetics of Adsorption  
    Many kinetic models have been proposed to 
elucidate the mechanism of solute adsorption. The 
rate and mechanism of adsorption are controlled   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by various factors like physical and/or chemical 
properties of adsorbent, ambient temperature, 
solution pH and nature of adsorbate. These kinetic 
models are useful for the design and optimization 
of effluent -treatment process. In order to 
investigate th e mechanism of AB292 dye 
adsorption by biomass the following three kinetic 
models were considered.  
Pseudo first -order kinetic model  
    The pseudo first -order kinetic model was 
proposed by Lagergren.  The integrated linear form 
of the model is (32,  33): 
Log (qe– qt) = log q e– 
  t 
 
    Where q e is the amount of dye adsorbed at 
equilibrium (mg/g),  qt is the amount of dye 
adsorbed at time t (mg/g), K 1 is the first -order rate  
constant (1/min) and t is time  (min).  
    Hence, a linear trace is expected  between the 
two parameters, log (q e-qt) and t, provided that the 
adsorption follows the first order kinetics. The 
values of k 1 and q e can be determined from the 
slope and intercept.  
    The results of pseudo first -order plot for the 
adsorption of AB292 dy e by biomass are given in  
Table 2 (Fig not shown). The calculated and

experimental q e values show a reasonable 
correlation in the case of pseudo first -order 
kinetics. Even though q ecal (calculated value ) and  
qeexp (experimental value) are closer, the R2 values 
suggest that the adsorption data fitted poor ly  to 
pseudo first -order kinetics. Hence, the adsorption 
AB292 dye onto Lem na minor does not follow  the 
pseudo first -order rate expression.  
Pseudo second -order kinetics  
    The adsorption may also be described by 
pseudo second -order kinetic model, if the 
adsorption does not follow the first order kinetics.  
    The linearized form of the pseudo second -order 
model is [34, 35]: 
 = 
  + 
  
 
    Where K 2 is the second -order rate constant 
(g/mg min)  and q e is the equilibrium adso rption 
capacity (mg/g). A plot of t/q t and t should give a 
linear relationship if the adsorption follows second 
order. q e and K 2can be calculated from the slope 
and intercept of the plot.  
    Fig. 7a shows the pseudo second -order plot for 
the adsorption of  AB292dye by biomass at various 
initial dye concentrations and the results are given 
in Table 2. The pseudo second - order rate constant 
decreases from 0.004 5 to 0.0014 (g/mg min) with 
the increases in initial dye concentration. The 
correlation coefficient R2 ranges from 0.995 to 
0.999, which is higher than pseudo first -order 
values. From the results, it can be  suggested that 
pseudo second -order describes the adsorption of 
AB292dye much better than pseudo first -order 
model.  
 Intra particle diffusion model  
    In the batch systems of adsorption process, 
initial adsorption occurs on the surface of the 
adsorbent. In addition, there is a possibility of the 
adsorbate to diffuse into the interior pores of the 
adsorbent. Weber and Morris suggested the 
following kine tic model to explore if the 
adsorption is intra -particle diffusion or 
not.According to this theory [36, 37]: 
qt = Kd. t½ 
    Where K d is the intra particle diffusion rate 
constant and is calculated by plotting q t against t½ 
(Fig. 7b) and the results are gi ven in Table 2. The 
linear portion of the plot for wide ranges of 
contact time between adsorbent and adsorbate 
does not pass through the origin. This deviation 
from the origin or near saturation may be due to 
the variation of mass transfer in the initial  and 
final stages of adsorption.  
    In the process of absorption, pH plays a key role 
in absorptive capacity and effects the adsorbent 
surface features (functional groups on the active  
sites), degree of ionization and removal efficiency . 
    The results sho w that the amount of adsorbed 
dye onto Lemna minor decreases as the pH 
increases from 3 to 11. This situation can be 
attributed to the surface charge of the adsorbent. 
Lemna minor has negatively charged adsorption 
sites, but it is positively charged at low  pH values.  
    Therefore, the electrostatic interactions between 
negatively charged -SO-3groups in the dye 
molecule and the positively charged adsorbent 
increase [28-40]. As a result, the amount of dye 
molecules onto the modified bentonite increases at 
lower pH values.

    Adsorption process of AB292 dye consists of 
two stages. At the first stage, rapid initial 
adsorption was observed in 45 min and at the 
second stage, adsorption process was slow and 
performed during 45 -90 min. A t this stage, the 
removal rate was slower than the first stage.  
    Obviously, increasing the time up to 90 min had 
no significant effect on removal rate. This effect is 
due to the availability of the initial abundant 
number of active sites on the sorbents at the 
beginning of the process, whereas, with the 
gradual increase of time, these sites are occupied 
by AB292 dye molecules and the adsorption 
process has become less effective with increasing 
time [41- 43]. 
    As in Fig. 4 was seen, by increasing the initial 
concentration of AB292 dye in aqueous solution , 
removal percentage was decreased. A t a constant 
Lemna minor biomass dose, the decrease in the    
adsorption percentage was seen which is probably 
due to the saturation of  the active sites on the 
biomass surface at higher AB292 dye 
concentrations  [44, 45]. On the other hand, by 
increasing the  initial AB292 dye  concentration, the 
actual amount of AB292 dye adsorbed per unit 
mass of the biomass was increased. The higher 
initial concentration of AB292 dye provides an 
important driving force to overcome the mass 
transfer resistance for AB292 dye t ransfer between 
the solution and the surface of the biomass.  
     Similar results were observed by Azarpira 
(2016) who investigated the effect of initial 
concentration on removal of Acid Orange 7 from 
aqueous solution by Cyperusrotundus biomass and 
indicat ed that adsorption decreases with increasing 
the initial concentration of metals [42]. 
    The adsorbent dose is another important 
parameter because it has a direct relationship with 
the uptake capacity of an adsorbent for a given

Balarak  D et al/ J. Hum. Environ. Health Promot. 2016; 2(1 ):9- 19  concentration of dye unde r the optimism 
conditions. As can be observed fr om Figure5, 
removal efficiency was increased by increasing 
the amount of Lemna minor biomass from 0.5 to 5 
g. This is mainly due to the greater available sites 
or surface area for the adsorption at the higher  
amount of the Lemna minor biomass [45, 46 ]. A 
similar phenomenon has also been shown in the 
adsorption of Acid violet 17from water with 
Orange peel  [38]. 
    Adsorption  isotherms are mathematical models 
that describe the distribution of the adsorbate 
species among liquid and adsorbent, based on a set 
of assumptions that are mainly related to th e 
heterogeneity/homogeneity of adsorbents, the type 
of coverage and possibility of interaction between 
the adsorbate species  [36].The Langmuir model 
was originally d eveloped to describe the 
adsorption of gas onto solid surface. It suggests 
the formation of monolayer adsorption and also 
the surface is energetically homogeneous  [38]. 
The Freundlich isotherm model is valid for 
multilayer adsorption on a heterogeneous 
adsorbent surface with sites that have different 
energies of adsorption  [39]. The Temkin isotherm 
assumes that the fall in the heat of adsorption is 
linear rather than logarithmic as stated in 
Freundlich expression. The heat of sorption of all 
molecules in th e layer would decrease linearly 
with coverage due to sorbate/sorbent interactions  
[36]. The correlation coefficients (R2) for 
Langmuir,  Freundlich, and Temkin models were 
0.998,  0.894  and 0.822 respectively. The proper 
agreement between the adsorption data  and 
Langmuir model implies that the adsorption of 
AB292 dye onto the Lemna minor biomass 
occurred as a single monolayer.  
4. Conclusion  
    The prediction of adsorption rate gives crucial 
information for designing sustainable batch 
adsorption systems. Info rmation on the kinetics of 
pollutant uptake is required for selecting optimum 
operating conditions for full -scale batch processes  
[38]. In order to evaluate the kinetic mechanism 
that controls the adsorption process, the experimental data was analyzed usin g pseudo -
first-order,  pseudo -second -order models and Intra 
particle diffusion.  The correlation coefficients (R2) 
for pseudo -second -order model are all higher than 
for the pseudo - first-order model and Intra particle 
diffusion and the experimental data fit the pseudo -
second -order model better than the pseudo -first-
order model and Intra particle diffusion. Also, 
qevalue agreed with the calculated values (q eexp), 
indicating a good fit of the adsorption process to 
this model. The results indicate that chemical 
adsorption might be the rate -limiting step. The 
results obtained were similar and supported by 
other researchers [16-18]. 
    This study focused on the biosorption of AB292 
dye onto Lemna minor biomass from aqueous 
solution. The operating parameters, pH of  
solution, biomass dosage, contact time and initial 
dye concentration were found to be effective on 
the biosorption efficiency of AB292 dye. The 
kinetic data signified that the biosorption of 
AB292 dye onto Lemna minor followed the 
pseudo -second -order kine tic model. It could be 
finally concluded that Lemna minor biomass, an 
inexpensive and easily available adsorbent, can be 
an alternative for more costly adsorbents used for 
dye removal in wastewater treatment processes.
