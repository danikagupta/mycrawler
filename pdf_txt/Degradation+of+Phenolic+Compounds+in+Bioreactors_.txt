Introduction
Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius  is a thermoacidophilic bac -
terium capable of deconstructing lignocelluloses, hemicel -
luloses and celluloses as documented in research [ 2, 17, 41, 
42], reviews on the topic [ 4, 5, 15] and in components of 
several patent [ 33–35]. Based on the ability of A. acidocal -
darius  to deconstruct hemicellulose and cellulose, we were 
interested in investigating its ability to deconstruct or lower 
the concentration of lignin derivatives, specifically the phe -
nolic compounds: phenol, ferulic acid, ρ-coumaric acid 
and sinapinic acid, as these compounds represent the base 
derivatives of lignin groups.
Phenol and its derivatives are aromatic compounds 
that occur naturally in the environment, most commonly 
within lignocellulosic polymers, which are estimated to 
cycle 200  billion tons of carbon annually [ 9]. The lignin 
polymer is the most significant component of lignocel -
lulose by mass, and second only to cellulose in its con -
tribution to living terrestrial biomass [ 11]. Lignin is an 
amorphous, polyphenolic material constructed from the 
enzyme-mediated polymerization of three phenylpropa -
noid monomers, coniferyl, ρ-coumaryl and sinapyl alco -
hols [ 12]. Lignin also serves to protect the more simple 
polymers, hemicellulose and cellulose, from being quickly 
degraded by bacteria and fungi. Due to the amount of fixed 
carbon bound in lignin matrices globally, it has received 
a significant attention as a compound important to biofuel 
applications [ 25]. To make biomass-to-fuel processes more 
economically feasible, it is important that technologies be 
developed that effectively remove lignin and its inhibi -
tory derivatives, primarily phenolic compounds, from the 
energy rich, fermentable sugars that comprise the hemicel -
lulose and cellulose.Abstract  Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius , a thermoaci -
dophilic bacterium, has a repertoire of thermo- and acid-
stable enzymes that deconstruct lignocellulosic compounds. 
The work presented here describes the ability of A. acido -
caldarius  to reduce the concentration of the phenolic com -
pounds: phenol, ferulic acid, ρ-coumaric acid and sinapinic 
acid during growth conditions. The extent and rate of the 
removal of these compounds were significantly increased 
by the presence of micro-molar copper concentrations, sug -
gesting activity by copper oxidases that have been identi -
fied in the genome of A. acidocaldarius . Substrate removal 
kinetics was first order for phenol, ferulic acid, ρ-coumaric 
acid and sinapinic acid in the presence of 50  μM cop -
per sulfate. In addition, laccase enzyme assays of cellular 
protein fractions suggested significant activity on a lignin 
analog between the temperatures of 45 and 90  °C. This 
work shows the potential for A. acidocaldarius  to degrade 
phenolic compounds, demonstrating potential relevance to 
biofuel production and other industrial processes.

In addition to being naturally ubiquitous, phenol and phe-
nolic compounds are also produced during industrial pro-
cesses, including petroleum refining, plastic manufacturing, resin production, pesticide production, steel manufacturing and the production of paints and varnish [3 , 19]. Because phe-
nolic compounds are water soluble, they are highly mobile in waste waters generated during these processes [10], and may be distributed to downstream river, lake, and soil sites, where they can accumulate to higher concentrations and cause eco-logical concerns [13]. Because of this, several techniques have been developed to remove phenol and its derivatives from industrial effluents and contaminated waters with biore-mediation receiving the most attention due to its low environ-mental impact and relatively low cost [26]. To this end, the removal of phenol has been observed using bacterial and fun-gal species including Candida tropicalis [ 30], Acinetobacter 
calcoaceticus [ 24], Alcaligenes eutrophus [ 18], Pseudomonas 
putida [ 22] and Burkholderia cepacia G4 [31].
With respect to the degradation and removal of phenol 
and phenolic compounds, genes for five putative multi-cop-per oxidases (GenBank Accession Numbers: ACV 59461.1; ACV 59462.1; ACV 58146.1; ACV 58141.1 and ACV 59388.1) have been identified in the sequenced genome of A. acidocaldarius [21]. These genes and select properties are shown in the supplemental files. Multi-copper oxidase such as laccase and laccase-like multi-copper oxidases (LMCO) are copper-containing genes that have been shown to act as polyphenol or phenol oxidases [27]. The presence of the genes for these enzymes prompted the addition of copper to certain media sets to determine any effects on the removal of phenolic compounds by A. acidocaldarius.
The work presented here builds on these and other 
efforts by reporting the ability of A. acidocaldarius, a ther -
moacidophile, to degrade phenol and its common deriva-tives, ferulic acid, ρ-coumaric acid and sinapinic acid under aerobic growth conditions. The findings presented suggest that A. acidocaldarius and/or enzymes produced by A. 
acidocaldarius may have applications in removing phe-nolic compounds from processes or waste streams at high temperatures and low pHs, conditions common for many bioenergy and industrial processes, including biomass pre-conversions, lignin deconstruction/solubilization and the mediation of potentially inhibitory phenolic compounds that are produced during the conversion of lignocellulose to fermentable sugars during biofuel applications.
Materials and methods
Culture medium and inoculum preparation
Chemicals were obtained from Fisher Chemical (Fairlawn, 
NJ, USA). A. acidocaldarius (ATCC 27009) was cultured in a basal mineral medium that contained the following (in g L
−1): CaCl2·2H2O, 0.25; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.5; (NH4)2SO4, 
1.3; Fe(III) ·EDTA, 0.047; KH2PO4, 3.0 and  xylose, 4.17 
(30 mM). The xylose was withheld from substrate-free controls. In addition, 1 mL L
−1 each of trace mineral stock 
solutions A, B, and C was added. Stock solution A con-tained (in g L
−1): MgCl2, 25.0; CaCl2·2H2O, 6.6; H3BO3, 
0.58; Fe(III)Cl3·6H2O, 5.0; CoNO3·6H2O, 0.05; and 
NiCl2·6H2O, 0.02. Stock solution B contained (in g L−1): 
MnSO4·H2O, 2.0; ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.5; and Na2MoO4, 0.025. 
Stock solution C was a vitamin solution that contained (in g L
−1): pyridoxine hydrochloride, 0.08; folic acid, 0.012; 
thiamine hydrochloride, 0.13; riboflavin, 0.042; nicotina-mide, 0.084; ρ-aminobenzoate, 0.088; biotin, 0.01; cya-nocobalamin, 0.0004; 
d-pantothenic acid calcium, 0.086; 
myo-inositol, 0.021; choline bromide, 0.053; orotic acid sodium salt, 0.021; and spermidine, 0.1. After the basal salts medium and stock solutions were mixed, the medium pH was adjusted to 4.0 using 6 N HCl and the medium was 
filtered (0.2 μm) under sterile conditions. Phenolic com-pounds and copper sulfate (as a potential enzyme co-fac-
tor) were added prior to filtration. The medium was then incubated at 60 °C for up to 1 h to solublilize the phenolic compounds.
Prior to each experiment, A. acidocaldarius cells pre-
served at −80 °C in 1-mL vials at 10 % dimethyl sulfox-ide (DMSO) were introduced as the initial inoculum. Cul-tures were grown in 125-mL Erlenmeyer flasks (40 mL medium volume), fitted with foam stoppers, and shaken at 120 rotations per minute (rpm) in an Innova 4230 tem-perature controlled incubator (New Brunswick, Edison, NJ, USA) at 60 °C. These initial cultures were allowed to grow into the late-exponential phase, when 0.4 mL aliquots were collected, concentrated via centrifugation (7000×g), and washed in substrate-free medium, before being inoc-ulated into fresh medium. This growth and re-inoculation process was repeated two times to allow the cells to adapt to the experimental conditions. Cell growth was moni-tored by measuring optical density at 595 nm using an UV–Vis V160u spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD, USA). All experiments were performed in triplicate and average values and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated.
Measurement of phenolic compoundsAn Agilent 7100 Capillary Electrophoresis (Foster City, 
CA, USA) instrument equipped with a diode-array detector was used to measure the concentrations of phenol, ferulic acid, ρ-coumaric acid and sinapinic acid. Data acquisition 
and analysis were accomplished using Agilent ChemSta-tion software. Methods developed by Bonoli et al. [6] were used, with the exception that the conditioning steps using 15 J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol (2016) 43:13–23 
1 3
HPCE-grade (Fisher Optima) and buffer solution were 
done for 5 min, rather than 2 min. This change resulted in more defined peaks when several consecutive samples were run. The running buffer used was 45 mM sodium tetraborate (pH 9.6). Samples were injected at the anodic end in a low pressure mode (3.4 kPa) for 3 s. Separation was carried out using a voltage of 27 kV for 10 min with a capillary temperature of 30 °C. The resulting current was 
110 μA. Before each injection, the capillary was rinsed in 
high pressure mode (137.9 kPa) with 0.1 N HCl for 2 min, HPCE-grade water for 2 min, and then re-equilibrated with the running buffer for 2 min. After each cycle, the capillary 
was rinsed with HPCE-grade water for 2 min. All rinses were conducted at 30 °C. Phenol, ferulic acid, ρ-coumaric 
acid and sinapinic acid eluted at approximately 7.0, 5.2, 5.9 and 3.8 min, respectively. Sample concentrations were determined from correlations calculated using analytical grade standards. Using these methods, the detection limits for phenol, ferulic acid, ρ-coumaric acid and sinapinic acid were approximately 10 μM.
Collection of protein fractionsTo isolate protein fractions, cells grown under conditions 
identical to those used in the phenolic removal experiments were harvested by centrifuging 40 mL-culture aliquots at 
7000×g for 15 min. The protein isolation method described 
here was adopted from Zambrano et al. [40]. The superna-tant was decanted and the pellet was washed with 5 mL of a 25 mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. This 
process was repeated twice before 5 μL of DNase/RNase and 20 μL of a protease inhibitor cocktail were added to 
the samples, which were then frozen using liquid nitro-gen, and allowed to thaw. The freeze–thaw application was repeated twice. Samples were then transferred to a 15 mL conical-bottom tube and sonicated twice for 1 min. Visual inspection using a light microscope at 1000× suggested significant cell lysis. The samples were allowed to incu-bate at room temperature for 15 min, and then centrifuged at 15,000×g for 35 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was col-
lected and, if necessary, saved at −80 °C. The pellet was then re-suspended in a 0.5 M NaCl solution with sodium acetate added to a concentration of 20 mM. DNase/RNase and protein inhibitor cocktails were added at 5 and 20 μL, respectively. This solution was centrifuged at 15,000×g for 25 min and the supernatant was added to the fraction col-lected previously. Collectively, this fraction was considered to predominantly contain soluble proteins, such as those often concentrated in the cytoplasm. The pellet was again re-suspended in 200 μL of 0.4 % triton X-100 in 25 mM PBS and centrifuged for 25 min at 15,000×g. The resulting supernatant was collected and considered to predominantly contain membrane-associated proteins. The remaining pellet was re-suspended in 200 μL of PBS and collected as the insoluble, membrane-bound, fraction. The protein concentrations in these fractions were measured using a Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and diluted to approximately 10 μg μL
−1 in the reaction buff-
ers. It should be noted that this method was used to affect some degree of fractionation between cytoplasmic/soluble proteins and membrane-bound proteins. The fractions are denoted as such, but this was a qualitative effort and the original cellular location of the separated proteins was not confirmed.
Enzyme assaysEach of the enzyme reactions was conducted at 60 °C 
and stirred at 200 rpm in a heated, temperature controlled cell within an Evolution 600 UV–vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The absorbance of the various assay-dependent oxidation products was measured with time, and data were collected and analyzed using VisionPro software (Visionpro, Calgary, Canada). The following assays were used:
Laccase activityThe enzyme solution (0.1 mL) was added to 0.1 mL 
sodium acetate (0.1 M, pH 5.0) and 0.8 mL of 0.3 % (w/v) 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS). The oxidation product of ABTS was monitored with time at 420 nm.
Manganese peroxidase0.5 mL of the enzyme solution was added to 0.1 mL of 
0.1 % (w/v) phenol red, 0.1 mL of 0.25 M sodium lactate, 0.2 mL of 0.5 % (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.05 mL of 
2 mM MnSO
4 and 0.05 mL of 100 mM H2O2 in 20 mM 
sodium succinate (pH 4.5). The oxidation of phenol red was monitored at 610 nm.
Lignin peroxidase0.5 mL of the enzyme solution was added to 0.5 mL H
2O2, 
0.5 mL of 10 mM veratryl alcohol and 1.0 mL of 125 mM 
sodium tartrate (pH 3.0). The reaction mixture was moni-tored at 310 nm to measure H
2O2 oxidation.
Modeling copper solubility and speciation
Visual MINTEQ (version 2.53) was used to predict the spe-
ciation of copper sulfate that was added to sets of growth media as a potential  enzyme co-factor. This modeling was done to approximate the amount of soluble and free-form 16 J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol (2016) 43:13–23
1 3
copper that might be biologically available to the cells dur -
ing growth. To determine the likely speciation of the media 
components, MINTEQ solved the thermodynamic equi-librium solutions using activities from the Debye–Huckel equation and the default MINTEQA2 thermodynamic data-base. The temperature was set to 60 °C and the free-proton concentration was calculated from the pH, which was fixed at 4.0. This method resulted in a prediction that over 99 % of the copper added would exist in the free-divalent form with respect to abiotic considerations.
Statistics and calculationsFor each experiment, tests were performed in triplicate and 
average values and 95 % confidence intervals were calcu-lated. The 95 % confidence intervals were calculated using a t-distribution assumption, which resulted in somewhat larger error bars than what would have been observed had a normal distribution of data variance been assumed. This is a more conservative estimate, and likely more accurate assumption, based on the limited number of replicates.
Results
Effect of copper concentration on cell growth and phenolic compound removal
When A. acidocaldarius was grown with xylose as the 
carbon and energy source, copper in the growth medium 
appeared to extend the lag phase of growth from between three and six hours without copper, to over nine hours when 100 μM copper was added (Fig. 1). In addition, the rate of 
cell growth and total cell yield decreased by approximately 20–30 % (calculations not shown). However, when copper was added to a concentration of 10 μM, there appeared to be no adverse effect on the total cell yield or rate of growth. Adding copper to 25 or 50 μM decreased total cell yields 
by less than 10 %, but did not have an appreciable effect on the rate of cell growth. The time required for the cultures to reach stationary phase ranged from 24 h at copper concen-trations of 0 and 10 μM to approximately 30 h at copper 
concentrations of 25, 50 and 100 μM.
The amount of copper in the culture media affected 
the rates and extent of phenolic compound removal by A. acidocaldarius (Fig. 2). In the absence of copper, phenol was degraded from a concentration of 0.52 ± 0.01 mM to 0.18 ± 0.03 mM in 24 h (Fig. 2a). However, when copper 
was added to an initial concentration of 100 μM, phenol was reduced to a concentration of 0.10 ± 0.02 mM in 6 h, and was completely removed (to below the detection limit) within 24 h. Copper had similar effects on the removal of ferulic, ρ-coumaric and sinapinic acids. For example, no 
statistically significant removal was measured in cultures containing ferulic acid when copper was absent; however, when copper was added to a concentration of 100 μM, fer -
ulic acid concentrations decreased from 0.50 ± 0.03 mM 
to 0.29 ± 0.01 mM over 48 h (Fig. 2b). Similar observa-
tions were made of cultures containing ρ-coumaric and 
sinapinic acid (Fig. 2c, d), although some removal of sinapinic acid was observed in the absence of copper, from 0.51 ± 0.01 mM to 0.43 ± 0.01 mM over 48 h. Experi-
ments using substrate-free (live cells) and heat-killed cells with and without copper showed no statistically significant decrease in phenolic compound concentrations (data not shown), suggesting that the decreases in phenolic concen-trations are not due to cellular sorption.
Initial removal rates were calculated from mass bal-
ance equations and plotted against the copper concentra-tions used in each experiment (Fig. 3). The relationships

resembled first-order Michaelis–Menten substrate kinet-
ics, with the exception that relatively low reaction rates were observed in the absence of copper. The V
max and Km 
values for each phenolic compound (phenol, ferulic acid, ρ-coumaric acid and sinapinic) were determined graphi-cally with respect to medium copper concentration using Lineweaver–Burk plots, and are shown in Table 1. While 
K
m and Vmax were significantly greater for phenol than the 
phenolic acids, they were statistically equivalent among ferulic, ρ-coumaric and sinapinic acid. Of note, these 
data show that the removal rates of phenolic compounds increase with copper concentration up to approximately 50 μM. Using higher copper concentrations did not result 
in statistically higher rates of removal.
Effect of initial concentrations of phenolic compounds 
on cell growth and on the removal of phenolic compounds
The extent and Michaelis–Menten relationships of phenolic 
compound removal were observed for A.acidocaldarius with respect to the initial concentrations of phenolic compounds (Figs. 4, 5). In addition, the inhibitory effects on the growth 
of A. acidocaldarius cultured in the presence of varying concentrations of phenol, ferulic acid, ρ -coumaric acid and 
sinapinic acid (Fig. 4 ) are described here. As with copper, the 
data show that phenol increases the time of lag-phase growth, from less than 6 h in the absence of phenol to between 6 and 12 h when phenol is present in concentrations up to 5 mM. In addition, there is a statistically significant effect on the total cell yield and growth rate when phenol is added to a concentration of 5 mM, but little or no effect when added to lower concentrations. Ferulic acid, ρ -coumaric acid and 
sinapinic acid also increase the duration of lag-phase growth from under 6 h in the absence of these compounds to over 18 h when these compounds are added to a concentration of 750 μM. Although there is little effect of these compounds 
on the total cell yield, the rate of growth decreased steadily with increasing initial concentrations.
The rate and extent of removal for each of the compounds 
tested increased with initial concentration. In each of these experiments, the copper concentration was set at 50 μ M and, 
like copper, the relationship between phenolic compound removal and initial concentration appears to be first order in nature. When added to concentrations of 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mM, phenol was completely degraded within 24 h. When added to an initial concentration of 5.0 mM, it was degraded to 0.95 ± 0.20 mM after 24 h. Between 25 and 50 % of the

ius in the presence of copper (0, 10, 25, 50 or 100 μM). The phenolic compounds were each added at an initial concentration of 0.5 mM.

initial ferulic acid, ρ-coumaric acid and sinapinic acid were 
degraded over a 36 to 72 h period when added to initial con-
centrations between 250 and 750 μ M. However, when added to an initial concentration of 100 μ M, each of these com-
pounds was nearly completely degraded within 36 h. Phenol, 
ferulic acid, ρ -coumaric acid and sinapinic acid show first-
order relationships with respect to their initial concentration (Fig. 5). The K
m and Vmax values for phenolic removal were 
calculated with respect to the phenolic concentrations, as described previously, and are shown in Table 2. Again, the 
K
m and Vmax values for phenol removal were significantly 
higher than those for ferulic, ρ -coumaric and sinapinic acid, 
which were not statistically different from each other within 95 % confidence.
Enzyme assay activityThe enzyme activities of collected protein fractions were 
calculated from assays designed to measure substrate oxi-dation by laccase-like, lignin peroxidase-like and manga-nese peroxidase-like enzymes (Table 3). These fractions were collected using methods designed to isolate the cyto-plasmic/soluble, membrane-associated, and membrane-bound proteins. However, as the proteins in these fractions were not characterized, their true origin should be con-sidered unknown, but with likely affinities towards either cytoplasmic origins, membrane-associated origins or mem-brane-bound origins. In each case, the addition of copper to the laccase assay increased the enzyme activity several fold. This activity was largely relegated to the membrane-associated and membrane-bound fractions.
Because of the fundamental mechanisms attributed 
to lignin and manganese peroxidases, these assays were carried out in the absence of copper. Some activity was measured in the soluble fraction, and a very small, nearly statistically insignificant amount was observed from the membrane-associated fraction. No activity was observed in the membrane-bound fraction for either lignin or manga-nese peroxidase.
Laccase activity from the membrane-associated frac-
tion was the most significant activity measured, and as this was a copper-dependent effect, it may be relevant to the removal of phenolics observed in the whole-cell experi-ments. Because of this, the laccase assays were repeated with the membrane-associated fraction between 45 and 90 °C to measure the effect of temperature on this reaction. Activities (normalized to the maximum observed activity) of 0.32 ± 0.15, 1.00 ± 0.07, 0.97 ± 0.04, and 0.23 ± 0.08 at 45, 60, 75 and 90 °C, respectively were measured (data shown in the supplemental material).
Discussion
A. acidocaldarius is able to reduce the concentration of phenolic compounds as a function of both initial copper

These data describe the dependency of enzyme activity on the copper 
concentration (half-saturation constant) and the maximum potential 
reaction rate of the enzyme (maximum reaction rate) with increas-
ing copper concentration. These parameters are one way to describe the importance of copper concentrations in the reactions that remove each of the compounds tested here (see Fig. 3). The initial concentra-tion of each compound was 0.5 mM. The values shown represent the averages of triplicate experiments ± 95 % confidence intervals. The confidence intervals suggest that the K
m and Vmax data for phenol are 
clearly significantly higher than those for the phenolic acids. How-ever, there is no statistically significant difference in the K

and initial phenolic compound concentrations. Relevant to 
these findings, and the potential applications, the data show that although some growth inhibition results from the appli-cable concentrations of these compounds, this inhibition does not appear to interfere significantly with the removal of phenol, ferulic acid, ρ-coumaric acid or sinapinic acid. In addition, the majority of the substrate is metabolized before the cultures reached the late-exponential growth phase. These two findings suggest that the enzymes needed to carry out the removal of phenolic compounds were not limited by the relatively low cell concentrations and slowed growth during the initial conditions tested here.

first-order dependence on phenolic concentrations (Fig. 4) 
supports the suggestion that, under the conditions tested here, the removal rate of phenolic compounds is not limited by enzyme concentrations, or factors affecting enzyme concentrations, such as cellular growth rates and total cell numbers.
The removal rates and kinetic parameters measured here 
are greater to, or comparable to, several previous studies of phenolic compound removal [7] and are also comparable to values observed during the oxidation of BTEX compounds [37]. Combined with the thermos- and acidic-tolerance of A. acidocaldarius and its enzymes, these results are rel-evant to several biotechnological applications, specifically those related to the feedstock preconversions and biochemi-cal conversions of biomass feedstocks where lignin-derived phenolics may inhibit downstream microbial activities. Within this study, the greater kinetic parameters and higher removal rates observed for phenol, compared to ferulic acid, ρ-coumaric acid and sinapinic acid, are not surprising, 
as phenol offers less steric hindrance to direct enzyme oxi-dation. Likewise, the similarity in parameters and removal rates observed for ferulic acid, ρ-coumaric acid and sinap-inic acid are not surprising, as these are structurally simi-lar compounds. However, these comparisons are relevant nonetheless, as there is a lack of literature directly compar -
ing the removal, and removal kinetics, of these compounds.
The observed first-order dependence on copper (Fig. 3) 
is interesting, and may suggest that A. acidocaldarius does 
not accumulate copper to a significant extent; in the manner that other microorganisms have been observed to concen-trate necessary co-factors, sometimes by several orders of magnitude [28]. Conversely, this observation suggests that at least some copper-dependent oxidases in A. acidocaldar -
ius simply replace copper after it oxidizes the substrate, in the case that the enzyme transfers electrons directly to the substrate. Another possibility is that the genetic translation of the relevant enzymes has pseudo-first-order dependen-cies on copper concentrations. Such dependencies on pro-tein translation have been reported previously for copper oxidases, although no kinetic data were reported [39].
In addition to the whole-cell experiments, enzyme 
assays were carried out using various protein fractions and substrate analogs. It is interesting to note that, in the cytoplasmic and membrane-associated fractions, some non-copper-dependent activity was observed for the lignin peroxidase assays, which measured the oxidation of the relatively simple 2,4-dichlorophenol compound. This activ-ity could explain how phenol and, to a lesser extent, ferulic acid, ρ-coumaric acid and sinapinic acid, were degraded 
in the absence of copper. Conversely, the highest activi-ties were observed in the membrane-associated and mem-brane-bound fractions in the laccase assays. These activi-ties were highly copper-dependent, suggesting that most of the phenolic removal observed may have been due to LMCOs, such as those suggested by genes in the genome of A. acidocaldarius (shown as a table in supplemental

rate) as determined by Michaelis–Menten kinetics in a Linewever 
Burk plot, with respect to initial substrate concentration
These data describe the dependency of enzyme activity on the sub-
strate concentration (half-saturation constant) and the maximum 
potential reaction rate of the enzyme (maximum reaction rate) with 
increasing substrate concentrations. These parameters are one way to describe the effects of substrate concentration on the reactions that remove the compounds tested here (see Fig. 5). The initial copper concentration in each test was 50 μM. The values shown represent the averages of triplicate experiments ± 95 % confidence intervals. The confidence intervals suggest that the K
m and Vmax data for phenol 
are clearly significantly higher than those for the phenolic acids. The K
m value for ferulic acid also appears to be higher than the Km values 
for ρ-Coumaric acid and Sinapinic acid. However, there is no statisti-
cally significant difference in the Vmax data among the phenolic acidsKm (mM) Vmax (mmol h−1)

files). In silico analysis of the protein products from three 
of the five genes analyzed showed the presence of signal peptides indicating transfer of these proteins to the exterior of the cell. This analysis provides additional support for the higher aromatic monomer degradation activities for the membrane-bound and membrane-associated fractions.
Assimilation of phenol and lignin-associated aromatic 
monomers by A. acidocaldarius for growth is further supported by the presence of genes for the meta-fission pathway for phenol degradation (Table 4). In addition, Aaci_1623 encodes an enzyme involved in metabolism of aromatic compounds and may be involved in phenol metabolism. This metabolism proceeds through the 4-oxa-locrotonate branch as opposed to the hydrolytic branch, a characteristic seen in other bacteria, such as Comamonas 
testosteroni strain TA441 [1]. In contrast to phenol hydro-lase catalyzed oxidation of phenol to catechol in C. testo-steroni, phenol oxidation by A. acidocaldarius is catalyzed by one or more of the putative multi-copper oxidases. Using this proposed mechanism, phenol is indirectly hydroxylated by the multi-copper oxidase [36], followed by ring cleavage and further breakdown into compounds that feed into the tricarboxylic acid cycle by other enzymes of the meta-fission pathway for phenol metabolism.
Laccase and LMCOs have great biotechnological poten-
tial for converting lignin in plant biomass to less structurally complicated polyphenols or aromatic monomers [14], as well as applications in the forest products industry [38]. In addition, like the lignin and manganese peroxidases, laccases are also thought to oxidize phenolic lignin residues [32], 
making such assays applicable in the remediation of certain processes, such as those in the textile industry. In line with such potential applications, the research presented here sug-gests that putative LMCOs of A. acidocaldarius do in fact degrade phenol and the phenolic compounds that are deriva-tives of compounds integral to lignocellulosic structures.
Previously, laccase genes and proteins have been primarily 
studied in mesophilic bacteria, including species of Bacillus Table 3  Measured activities for

[29], Pseudomonas [ 16] and Streptomyces [ 23]. In addition, 
thermo- and hyperthermophilic laccases have been isolated 
from prokaryotes, including Eubacteria, such as Thermus thermophilus, Thermobifida fusca and Thermobaculum ter -
renum [ 8], and Archaea such as Pyrobaculum aerophilum 
[20]. The work presented here, notably the temperature range 
over which the studied enzyme fractions were active, builds on such results and implies a broad and industrially relevant temperature range for biotechnological applications for the enzymes catalyzing this activity. Specifically, the tempera-ture range tested includes conditions that may be used in the preconversions of lignocellulosic feedstocks where organic extractives, including phenolics, may be liberated. Of note, previous efforts have identified glycosyl hydrolase enzymes from A. acidocaldarius that showed activity across a similar 
temperature range (unpublished data).
These findings contribute to an important research need 
to identify and characterize biomass degrading enzymes that are active under conditions often encountered in the biorefinery of lignocelluloses (i.e., high temperature, low pH). The use of these specialized enzymes in the processes may enable the mineralization of biomass to occur at higher temperatures (less cooling of substrate) and lower pH (less neutralization), saving money in both capital and operating costs. In addition to the possible deconstruction of biomass, the removal of extractable organics, such as phenolics, may benefit downstream conversion processes.
Conclusions
The present study shows the potential for the thermoaci-dophile A. acidocaldarius to degrade phenolic compounds 
found in lignin demonstrating potential relevance to bio-fuel production and other industrial processes. The major -
ity of the observed removal was dependent on added cop-per, both in whole-cell and enzyme assay experiments. This suggests that putative multi-copper oxidases iden-tified in the genome of A. acidocaldarius demonstrated laccase-like activity and may play an important role in the degradation of these lignin byproducts and constitu-ents. Enzyme assays demonstrated that the majority of the activity was due to fractions associated with mem-brane-associated or membrane-bound proteins. Finally, observed enzyme activities from 45 to 90 °C show that A. acidocaldarius may possess laccase-like enzymes appli-cable to biotechnological processes over a wide range of temperatures.
