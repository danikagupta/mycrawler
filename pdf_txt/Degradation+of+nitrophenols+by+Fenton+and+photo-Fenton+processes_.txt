11. Introduction
4-Nitrophenol (4-NP) is a hazardous, bio-refractory organic com-
pound and is widely used for the production of pesticides, herbi-cides, insecticides and synthetic dyes [1]. It is highly stable and soluble in water and persists in soil and ground water for a longer period of time [2]. The discharge of 4-NP from various industries to water streams is of main concern due to its toxicity and suspected carcinogenicity. The development of efficient methods for removal of 4-NP, is becoming an important field of study for researchers.
Several treatment methods such as chemical, physical and bio-
logical have been employed for the treatment of 4-NP from waste-water [3]. Physical and biological treatment techniques are not very satisfactory as they transfer the pollutants from one phase to another, and the equipment required for these processes is also very costly [4]. Recently advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) showed considerable potential for the removal of 4-NP from in-dustrial effluents [5-9]. In AOPs, the hydroxyl radicals (
•OH) are 
generated in solution and are responsible for the oxidation and mineralization of the organic pollutants to water and carbon dioxide [10-13]. Among various AOPs, the Fenton oxidation process has b e e n  u s e d  e x t e n s i v e l y ,  a s  r e a g e n ts  (f e r r o u s  s u l p h a t e  h e p ta h y d r a t e 
and hydrogen peroxide) used are easy to handle and environ-mental friendly [14]. The main advantage of this method is that the reaction takes place at ambient temperature, atmospheric pres-sure and short reaction period, which makes the process less ex-pensive [15].
Various studies available on degradation of organic pollutants 
using a homogeneous Fenton oxidation process are presented in Table 1.
It is observed from Table 1, that the homogeneous Fenton oxida-
tion process is still very active for the degradation of various organic pollutants. Further, it is observed that most of the studies 
are available on the degradation/ decolourization of organic pollu-
tants, however, very few studies are reported on mineralization 
(TOC and COD removal) of the organic pollutants. The studies 
of Fathi and Keshmirizadeh [4], Ertugay and Acar [16], Giri and 
Golder [17] and Barbusinski [18] have analyzed COD removal % for various organic pollutants. Giri and Golder [17] has reported 
TOC removal (37.9%) for ciprofloxacin. The degradation studies 
alone do not reveal the conversion of toxic organic pollutants in simpler organic compounds. Thus mineralization of organic pollutants Environ. Eng. Res. 2021; 26(3): 190145

ABSTRACT
The mineralization analysis of wastewater is important for the gr owth of flora and fauna. The mineralization along with the deg radation of 
4-NP has been studied using homogeneous Fenton oxidation process. The mineralization of 4-NP has been reported in terms of chem ical oxygen 
demand (COD) removal % and total organic carbon (TOC) removal %. The main parameters that affect the mineralization and degrada tion 
of 4-NP i.e. initial pH (1 – 5), reaction time (0 – 60 min), the concentration of hydrogen peroxide (1 – 5 mM) and concentration of ferrous 
ions (0.05 – 0.5 mM) have been optimized. In the present study, optimum reaction conditions for mineralization and degradation of 4-NP are 
o b s e r v e d  a t  p H  3 ,  4  m M  o f  H 2O2 concentration, 0.2 mM of Fe2+ concentration and in 40 min of reaction time. At the optimum condition, COD 
removal and TOC removal were 50% and 60.3%, respectively along with 93.6% of 4-NP degradation. At optimized conditions, interme diate products 
obtained after homogeneous degradation of 4-NP were identified based on LC-MS spectra analysis. The degradation of 4-NP followe d, second 
order reaction rate. The present study showed the higher degradation and mineralization of 4-NP as compared to available studie s on 4-NP.

4(TOC removal % and COD removal %) is also important along 
with decolorization/degradation studies and there is a need to study the mineralization of organic pollutants along with the degradation 
of organic pollutants.
The present study has been focused on mineralization of 4-NP 
along with its degradation using homogeneous Fenton oxidation 
process. Various parameters like initial pH, reaction time, concen-
tration of hydrogen peroxide and ferrous ions that affect the degrada-tion and mineralization (COD and TOC removal %) of 4-NP have 
been optimized. Further the studies have been extended to identify 
the degradation products of 4-NP using LC-MS spectra technique. The results of mineralization and degradation of 4-NP have also 
been compared with the available studies. 
2. Material and Methods
2.1. Materials
4-NP (w/w, 98% purity), ferrous sulphate heptahydrate (FeSO 4.7H 2O) 
(w/w, purity>99%), sulphuric acid (98% purity), mercuric sulphate 
(purity 99%), silver sulphate (purity > 99%), were obtained from Loba Chemie Pvt. Ltd. (Mumbai, India). Hydrogen peroxide (30% 
w/w) was purchased from Ranbaxy Fine Chemicals Limited (Gujarat, 
India). Sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 97% purity), ferrous ammonium sulphate (FAS) (99% purity) was taken from s.d. fine Chemical 
Limited (Mumbai, India). Potassium dichromate (K
2Cr2O7, purity 
> 99%) was obtained from Qualigens Fine Chemicals (Mumbai, India). All the solutions were prepared using double distilled water.
2.2. Experimental Procedure
Batch experiments for mineralization and degradation of 4-NP were performed by taking 0.05 mM ferrous sulphate solution into a 250 mL Erlenmeyer glass flask containing 100 mL of 4-NP (100 
mg/L) solution. The pH of the solution was adjusted by the addition 
of a few drops of H
2SO4 ( 0 . 1  N )  a n d  N a O H  ( 0 . 1  N )  a n d  w a s  m e a s u r e d 
using a pH meter (pH 700 Eutech). After the pH adjustment, 1 
mM H 2O2 was added quickly to the solution with continuous stirring 
at 30°C. With the addition of H 2O2 solution, the reaction started 
and the samples were taken out from the flask periodically and 
the reaction was stopped by adding two drops of 1 M NaOH. 
Thereafter, the solution was filtered and the filtrate was analyzed for mineralization (TOC and COD removal %) and percentage 
degradation. The above experiments were repeated to study the 
effect of various parameters such as: pH (1 - 5), reaction time (0 - 60 min), concentration of ferrous ions (0.05 – 0.5 mM) and 
concentration of H
2O2 (1 – 5 mM). All the experiments were repeated 
three times to get reproducibility of ± 5%. 
2.3. Analytical Methods
The 4-NP degradation (%) after the reaction was analyzed using 
UV/VIS spectrophotometer at λmax 318 nm (Shimadzu double beam 
spectrophotometer Model: UV-VIS 2600/2700). The degradation efficiency was calculated as:

The TOC analysis of the samples was done using a TOC analyser 
(Model: ASI-V and TOC-V CPN, Shimadzu, Japan) before and after the degradation of 4-NP. The non-dispersive infrared method was 
adopted for the detection of TOC. The TOC efficiency was calculated 
as:

Liquid chromatography –mass spectroscopy (LC –MS) analysis 
of the reacted 4-NP samples was made to identify the intermediate 
products over the mass range of 40 –400 amu. (model: Q-TOF micro 
waters, Waters, USA). The reacted sample was analyzed for determi-nation of intermediate products using negative mode electrospray 
ionization (ESI) technique.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Effect of pH
The pH value of solution influenced the generation of hydroxyl radicals and thus the oxidation efficiency of 4-NP. It is known 
that the Fenton’s reaction is ac tive in acidic medium. Thus, the

of 4-NP i.e. degradation efficiency, COD removal (%) and TOC 
removal (%) is presented in Fig. 1.
It is observed that the degradation (%) of 4-NP increased from 
28% to 84% with an increase in pH from 1 to 3 and thereafter 
it  d e c re a se d  to  6 5 %  w ith  a n  in c re a s e  in  p H  fro m  3  to  5 . S im ila rly , the COD and TOC removal (%) of 4-NP has increased from 16% 
to 42% and 23% to 53%, respectively with increase in pH from 
1 to 3 and it decreased to 32% and 40%, respectively with further increase in pH from 3 to 5. The maximum degradation of 84 % 
was obtained for 4-NP at pH 3. The CO D rem oval (% ) and TO C 
removal (%) for 4-NP, at 3 pH were 42% and 53% respectively. Therefore, the optimum pH for the degradation along with minerali-
zation of 4-NP was 3. Below pH 3, the degradation (%) of 4-NP Environmental Engineering Research 26(3) 190145

was low because very less •OH radicals were produced as hydrogen 
peroxide was not decomposed by Fe2+ ions due to the stable oxygen 
concentration [29]. At very low pH, H+ ion acts as •OH radical 
scavengers according to Eq. (4) [30].
HO● + H+ + e󰡈 → H2O( 4 )
Inhibition of •OH radical generation at low pH is due to the 
formation of complex species [Fe(H 2O)6]2+ which reacts very slowly 
with hydrogen peroxide. In addition, the H 2O2 gets solvated in 
the presence of high concentration of H+ ions at low  pH  to form 
stable oxonium ion [H 3O2]+. The oxonium ion makes H 2O2 electro-
philic to enhance its stability, thus reducing the reactivity with 
Fe2+ ions [31]. At pH 4 and 5, due to the formation of ferrous 
and ferric oxy-hydroxides complexes, lesser amount of the •OH 
radicals were generated which might have resulted in lower degrada-
tion and mineralization of 4-NP [11]. De Luis et al. [32] study 
has also observed maximum degradation of phenols (ortho, meta and para-cresol) at pH 3 using a homogeneous Fenton oxidation 
process. Meric et al. [22] achieved COD removal of 78.6% for Reactive 
Black 5 (RB5) dye at pH 3. 
3.2. Effect of Reaction Time
The degradation of 4-NP was analyzed by varying the reaction tim e fro m  4  m in  to  1  h  a n d  is sh o w n  in  F ig. 2 . T h e rea ctio n  tim e needed for the degradation of 4-NP will depend on various parame-
ters like pH, initial concentration of 4-NP, concentrations of ferrous 
ions and H
2O2. For the initial reaction of 100 mg/L of 4-NP, 2 
mM of H 2O2, 0.2 mM of Fe2+ c o n c e n t r a t i o n  a n d  a t  p H  3 ,  i t  i s  
observed that the degradation of 4-NP increased linearly up to 
8 min of reaction time and then followed the non-linear increase up to 40 min. The degradation of 4-NP was increased from 35% 
to 84%  w ith increase in reaction tim e fro m  4 m in  to 40 m in  and 
thereafter no further degradation of 4-NP has been noticed. Therefore, the optimum reaction time for the degradation of 4-NP 
was observed to be 40 min for further studies.
Fig. 2. Effect of reaction time on the degradation of 4-NP; Conditions: 
[4-NP] = 100 mg/L, [H 2O2] = 2 mM, [Fe2+] = 0.2 mM, pH 
= 3 and time 60 min. 
3.3. Effect of H 2O2 Concentration
The dosage of H 2O2 is an important parameter as it affects the 
generation of OH radicals. The H 2O2 concentration was varied from 
1 mM to 5 mM to study the mineralization and degradation of 
4-NP. The effect of H 2O2 on the degradation, COD removal and 
TO C rem oval of 4-NP is show n in Fig. 3. It is observed that the 
degradation, COD removal and TOC removal of 4-NP increased 
with increase in concentration of H 2O2 from 1 mM to 4 mM and 
thereafter decreased. The H 2O2 concentration of 4 mM, degradation, 
COD removal (%) and TOC removal (%) of 4-NP were obtained 
to be 93.6, 50% and 60.3%, respectively. Increased concentration of H
2O2 fro m  1  m M  to  4  m M  hav e resulted  in  m ore  •OH radicals, 
which might have increased the degradation and mineralization 
of 4-NP. Further at higher H 2O2 dosage, i.e. 5 mM the decrease 
in degradation, COD removal and TOC removal of 4-NP might

6be due to the scavenging of generated •OH radicals i.e. the •OH 
radicals may react with H 2O2 to generate HO 2• radicals and which 
are less reactive than •OH radicals [18, 33].
H2O2 + HO● → HO●
2 + H 2O( 5 )
Also the unused portion of H 2O2 during the Fenton process 
contributed to COD and hence the excess amount was not recom-
mended [34, 35].
3.4. Effect of Fe2+ Ions Concentration
It is utmost important to analyze the optimum loading of Fe2+ 
ions to mineralize and degrade 4-NP, because at low Fe2+ ion concen-
trations, the degradation and mineralization of 4-NP are less due to insufficient amount of Fe
2+ ions. But higher quantities of Fe2+ 
ions lead to an unutilized quantity of iron salt, which further contrib-
utes to increase the total dissolved solids content in the solution [36, 37]. The range of Fe
2+ ion concentration was selected by perform-
ing initial experiments. The concentration of Fe2+ ions was varied 
from 0.05 mM to 0.5 mM and keeping the rest of the parameters constant and the results are shown in Fig. 4. It was found that 
the degradation and mineralization (TOC and COD removal) rate 
increased with an increase in the Fe
2+ ion concentration up to 
0.2 mM of aqueous solution and after that the degradation and 
mineralization rate decreased (Fig. 4). The maximum degradation 
of 4-NP (93.6%) was observed at Fe2+ ion concentration of 0.2 
mM.

COD removal and TOC removal; Conditions: [4-NP] = 100 mg/L, [H
2O2] = 4 mM, pH = 3, time 40 min.
The mineralization i.e. COD removal and TOC removal increased 
from 30% to 50% and 50.4% to 60.3%, respectively, with increase 
in Fe2+ ion concentration from 0.05 mM to 0.2 mM. The higher

3.5. Reaction Mechanism Showing the Degradation Pathways 
of 4-NP
The •OH radicals were generated during the reaction between Fe2+ 
ions and hydrogen peroxide. The •OH radicals reacted with 4-NP 
compound and led to the formation of intermediate products. The 
reaction products of the degraded 4-NP were identified using LC-MS spectra at a retention time of 3.542 min (Fig. 5). 3,4-dihydroxyni-
trobenzene, 1,2,4 trihydroxylbenzene, 1,2-dihydroxyaminophenol, 
4-aminophenol, Hydroquinone, p-benzoquinone, 3,4,5-tridydrox-ynitrobenzene, 1,2,6-trihydroxy-4-aminophenol and acetic acid 
were identified as the some of the intermediate products by the 
following reactions:

mediate products using photo-oxid ative degradation of 4-NP. Jiang 
et al. [40] carried out electrochemical degradation of 4-NP and resulted in the formation of hydroquinone, p-benzoquinone, 4-ami-
nophenol as the intermediate products. Sun and Lemley [41], Zhao 
et al. [42] and Minz et al. [43] studies have reported the formation of 3,4-dihydroxynitrobenzene, 1,2,4-trihydroxylbenzene, hydro-
quinone, p-benzoquinone, as the intermediate products after degra-
dation of 4-NP. Some of the residual fragments against molecular weights 76.96, 188.99, 217.0, 225.15, 255.21, 281.22, 283.25, 299.19 
and 327.28 remained unidentified may be due to the complexity 
of their formation in the solution phase. 
3.6. Kinetic Study
The kinetics of the reaction helps to study the factors which influ-ence the rate of reaction like reactant concentration, oxidant concen-tration and composition of the reaction mixture [44] and provides 
useful information about the mechanism and rate of chemical 
reaction. Kinetic study for the degradation of 4-NP was done as a function of time at optimum reaction conditions, i.e. initial 4-NP 
concentration 100 mg/L, [H
2O2]: 4 mM, [Fe2+]: 0.2 mM and pH 
3. The degradation data of 4-NP was analyzed for 1st order and 
2nd order rate expressions as:
First order kinetics
(17)
Second order kinetics
(18)
Where, C 0 is the initial concentration of 4-NP and C t   is the concentration of 4-NP at any time t, k and k’ represents the rate 
constants of first and second order reactions respectively. 
Kinetic rate constant for the degradation of 4-NP for 1st order 
and 2nd order rate expression are 0.0829 min-1 and 0.0037 L mg-1 
min-1. The higher value of the regression coefficient (0.974) for 
2nd o rder rea ctio n a s co m pared to 1st order reaction (0.853) shows 
that the degradation of 4-NP obeys 2nd order reaction rate with 
rate constant of 0.0037 L mg-1 min-1. Ghosh et al. [26] also observed 
second order rate for the degradation of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) 
and nitrobenzene using Fenton reagent. The degradation of 2,6-di-
methyl aniline using •OH radicals also showed that the data was 
well fitted to second order kinetic model [45].

efficiency was 30.6%, i.e. only one-third of 4-NP was mineralized. 
Another study on the degradation of nitrophenols: 2-nitrophenol (2-NP), 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) and 2,4,6-tri-
nitrophenol (TNP), the maximum mineralization (DOC) for 
mono-nitrophenols was 32% [23].  However, in the present study, 93.6% degradation of 4-NP was achieved with 50% COD removal 
and 60.3% TOC removal efficiency in the short reaction period 
of 40 m in. The m ineralization efficiency achieved is higher than the previous studies. 
4. Conclusions
The mineralization studies on 4-NP along with degradation have been made using homogeneous Fenton’s oxidation. 
The present study revealed that homogeneous Fenton’s oxida-
tion process can be used for the mineralization and degradation Table 3. Comparison of Present Study for The De

and mineralization are observed at pH 3, H 2O2 concentration 
of 4 mM, Fe2+ concentration of 0.2 mM in 40 min of reaction 
time. At optimal condition, 93.6% of 4-NP were degraded within 
40 min with COD removal (%) and TOC removal (%) of 50% and 60.3%, respectively. The kinetic study revealed the degrada-
tion of 4-NP by second order kinetics with rate constant of 0.0037 
L mg
-1 min-1 and correlation coefficient 0.974. The higher mineral-
ization efficiency of 4-NP (50% COD removal and 60.3% TOC 
removal) has been observed in the present study as compared 
to the previous reported studies. Based upon the LC-MS spectra analysis 3,4-dihydroxynitrobenzene, 1,2-dihydroxyaminophenol, 
1,2,6-trihydroxy-4-aminophenol, 3,4,5-trihydroxynitrobenze, 4-aminophenol, 
hydroquinone, p-benzoquinone, acetic acid etc. have been identi-fied as the intermediate products. The present study indicated 
that the Fenton process was a feasible method to treat acidic 
wastewaters. This method could also be used in combination with other AOPs for better results.
