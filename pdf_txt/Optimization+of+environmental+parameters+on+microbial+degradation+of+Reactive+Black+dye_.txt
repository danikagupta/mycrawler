Introduction
Rapid industrialization has necessitated the manufacture and use 
of different chemicals in day to day life [1,2].  The textile industry is one 
of them which extensively use synthetic chemicals as dyes. Wastewaters 
from textile industries pose a threat to the environment, as large amount of chemically different dyes are used. A significant proportion of these dyes enter the environment via wastewater [1]. Approximately 10,000 different dyes and pigments are used industrially and over 0.7 million tons of synthetic dyes are produced annually, worldwide [3]. Pollution due to textile industry effluent has increased during recent years. Moreover, it is very difficult to treat textile industry effluents because of their high Biochemical oxygen demand, Chemical oxygen demand, heat, color, pH and the presence of metal ions [4]. The textile finishing generates a large amount of waste water containing dyes and represents one of the largest causes of water pollution  [5], as 
10-15% of dyes are lost in the effluent during the dyeing process [6].The traditional textile finishing industry consumes about 100 liters ofwater to process about 1 kg of textile material. The new closed-looptechnologies such as the reuse of microbial or enzymatic treatment ofdyeing effluents could help reducing this enormous water pollution[7]. Azo dyes have been used increasingly in industries because oftheir ease and cost effectiveness in synthesis compared to natural dyes.However, most azo dyes are toxic, carcinogenic and mutagenic [8]. Azobonds present in these compounds are resistant to breakdown, with thepotential for the persistence and accumulation in the environment [9].Several physico-chemical techniques have been proposed for treatmentof colored textile effluents. These include adsorption on differentmaterials, oxidation and precipitation by Fenton’s reagent, bleachingwith chloride or ozone photo degradation or membrane filtration [10].All these physical or chemical methods are very expensive and result inthe production of large amounts of sludge, which creates the pollution.Therefore, economic and safe removal of the polluting dyes is still animportant issue. Bioremediation through microorganisms has beenidentified as a cost effective and environment friendly alternative fordisposal of textile effluent [11,12]. In recent years a number of studieshave focused on some microorganisms capable of degrading andabsorbing dyes from wastewater. A wide variety of microorganisms arereported to be capable of decolonization of dyes [13-25].Materials and Methods
Collection of samples
Samples were collected from in and around Common Effluent 
Treatment Plant (CETP) of Ankleshwar, Gujarat, India. Samples were 
collected from different places, such as drainage canal that carry textile effluent to CETP, various stages of CETP. Samples were in the form of untreated effluent, treated effluent, sludge, and soil. All the samples were collected in sterile glass-screw cap tubes and preserved at 4°C in refrigerator and samples were tested within 24 hrs of collection.
Isolation of azo dye degrading bacteria
Bacterial strains were isolated through enrichment technique and 
Reactive Black azo dye was used as the source of carbon and nitrogen in 
the mineral salt medium [26]. The composition of mineral salt medium (MSM) of pH 7.2 ± 0.02 used for the isolation of bacteria was (g L
-1): 
NaCl (1.0), CaCl2·2H2O (0.1), MgSO4·7H2O (0.5), KH2PO4 (1.0) and 
Na2HPO4 (1.0), yeast extract (4.0) and agar (for solid medium only) 
15. Dilution plate technique was employed to obtain pure cultureof bacterial strains. Bacterial strains were isolated from differentwastewater samples of textile industry to use them as inocula. The100 mg L
-1 broth MSM was taken into conical flasks (250 mL), and
spiked with Reactive Black (250 mg L-1) as the sole source of carbon
and nitrogen. The mixture was inoculated with 5 mL of wastewater.The flasks were incubated at 32°C for 5-6 days under static conditions.After incubation, cell suspensions from each flask were plated ontoMSM agar medium and incubated at 32°C for 24 h. Microbial coloniesthat appeared on the agar medium were re-suspended into the flaskscontaining fresh MSM broth (100 mg L

Abstract
The study involved isolation of bacteria possessing high potential to degrade Reactive Black azo dye in liquid 
medium. Eighty four strains of bacteria were isolated through enrichment technique by using Reactive Black azo 
dye as the source of carbon and nitrogen in the mineral salt medium. Bacterial strains showing high decolorization rate were used to optimize the decolorization of Reactive Black azo dye in liquid culture. The optimum conditions determined for the four selected bacterial strains for decolorization of Reactive Black (250 mg L
-1) were pH 7.0, 
temperature 32°C, when dye solution was supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract as a co-substrate. Out of these four strains, two strains ETL-1 ( Klebsiella oxytoca) and ETL-2 ( Bacillus subtillis ) showed an excellent potential to 
decolorize 500 mg L
-1 Reactive Black in 6 h in the liquid broth.Journal of

Black dye (250 mg L-1). After an incubation of 5-6 days at 32°C, the 
cell suspensions were once again plated onto the agar medium. About eighty four actively growing colonies on the medium were selected from different wastewater samples. They were purified by streaking twice on agar medium. The purified cultures were preserved in refrigerator for subsequent studies.
Preparation of inocula
Liquid broth was prepared by following the MSM composition 
described by Khalid et al. [26]. The pH of the broth was adjusted to 
7. The 100 mL of broth in 250 mL conical flask were inoculated with the respective isolated strains. Inoculated flasks were incubated under static conditions for period of 48 h at 32°C. After 48 h of incubation, 
optical density of 0.6 ± 0.01 was achieved at 590 nm wavelength, using 
optical density meter to maintain a uniform cell density. One mL of inocula was added in 10 mL medium for inoculation.
Screening of azo dye degrading bacteria
Screening was done to single out the efficient bacterial strains 
capable of decolorizing Reactive Black azo dye using modified MSM in a triplicate study. For this purpose, liquid MSM medium was prepared and it was spiked with 250 mg L
-1 dye. The medium was inoculated 
with the respective inocula (84 isolates) and incubated at 32°C for 48 h. After 48 h, the medium was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min. Then decolorization was determined with the help of spectrophotometer at 597 nm by using Reactive Black dye as standard. Uninoculated 
media served as blanks. Percent decolorization was calculated and 
the five best isolates exhibiting maximum decolorization ability was selected for further experimentation. The five most effective bacterial isolates (ETL-1, ETL-2, ETL-12, ETL-14 & ETL-16) were further examined for their decolorization potentials in glass test tubes. Ten milliliters of the sterilized MSM broth containing Reactive Black dye at the concentration of 250 mg L
-1 was added to the autoclaved test 
tubes supplemented with yeast extract (4 g L-1) as a co-substrate. The 
medium was inoculated with the respective bacterial strains by adding inocula of uniform cell density. The test tubes were tightly sealed to provide reduced conditions. The tubes were incubated at 32°C under static conditions. Uninoculated MSM containing azo dye in the test 
tubes was also incubated under similar conditions to check abiotic 
decolorization of the dye. The decolorization was measured at 597 nm by spectrophotometer as described by Khalid et al. [26].
Optimization
Various factors were optimized to achieve the highest 
decolorization rate of Reactive Black by the selected isolates of bacteria. 
All the experiments were conducted in triplicate. Preliminary studies 
were conducted to select the standard conditions such as substrate 
concentration (250 mg L-1), pH (7), temperature (32°C) and static 
incubation. 
Azo dye concentration
Five levels (50, 100, 200, 250, and 500 mg L-1) of Reactive Black 
azo dye were used to find the best concentration for maximum 
decolorization. The inoculum was added to the medium (10 mL) 
at inoculum: broth ratio of 1:50. Incubation temperature was 35°C. 
Decolorization was determined by taking 1.5 mL aliquots periodically 
from different test tubes and centrifuging the solutions at 8,000 rpm 
for 15 min to remove the cells. The absorbance of the supernatants was 
measured at the 597 nm, for Reactive Black by using spectrophotometer. 
Uninoculated blank was run to check the abiotic decolorization . Each 
dye level was replicated thrice.Carbon source
In order to assess the effects of different carbon sources on bacterial 
decolorization, four carbon sources, namely glucose, maltose, mannitol 
and yeast extract were used at the rate of 4 g L-1. The MSM spiked with 
Reactive Black at the concentration of 250 mg L-1 was used. Incubation 
temperature was 35°C. Decolorization was determined by using the protocol as described above. The experiment was conducted in three replications.
pH
Effect of different pH ranging from 4 to 10 was examined on the 
decolorization efficiency of the selected five bacterial isolates. MSM that was enriched with Reactive Black at the concentration of 250 mg L
-1 was used. Incubation temperature was maintained at 35°C. The pH 
was adjusted by using 0.01 M HCl or 0.01 M NaOH solutions.
Temperature
Decolorization of Reactive Black by the selected bacterial isolates 
was studied at different temperatures such as 25, 30, 32, 35, 40 and 42°C. Medium used for this purpose was Mineral Salt Media (MSM), which 
was enriched with Reactive Black at the concentration of 250 mg L
-1. 
pH of the MSM was maintained at 7. Decolorization was determined 
as described above.
Results
Isolation and screening of azo dye decolorizing bacteria
All of the 84 bacterial isolates from the enrichment culture were 
screened for their efficiency to remove azo dyes from spiked broth. Bacterial isolates showed variable potential to decolorize 250 mg L
-1 
Reactive Black in broth medium. Only 10-15% isolates were able to decolorize the dye more than 85% in 24 h as compared to abiotic control. The majority of these isolate showed medium potential of decolorization of the dye, which ranged between 35 to 70% as compared to control. Figure 1 shows that the most efficient bacterial isolates had excellent potential to degrade Reactive Black and percent decolorization ranged from 91 to 100. The most efficient bacterial isolate in decolorizing the Reactive Black was ETL-1 that completely removed dye color. It was followed by 98% decolorization by ETL-2. Next effective strains in descending order were ETL-12 and ETL-14. The strain ETL-16 was the least efficient decolorizing strain. Based on these results, the most efficient isolates exhibiting the highest potential of decolorization in 24 h were selected for further experiments. The selected isolates were ETL-1, ETL-2, ETL-12, ETL-14 and ETL-16.

potential of bacteria. It is very clear from figure 2 that decolorization 
of Reactive Black by all the strains increased sharply when the dye concentration increased from 50 to 250 mg L
-1. Maximum decolorization 
was observed at 250 mg L-1 of substrate concentration. Then, the rate 
of decolorization was reduced with the increase in dye concentration. A variation in decolorization rate by different strains of bacteria was 
also observed. Strain ETL-1 showed the highest decolorization at all 
dye concentration and complete color removal of 250 mg dye L
-1 was 
observed after 24 h. The rate of decolorization by strain ETL-2 was almost comparable with that of ETL-1 at all tested concentration of 
dye. Other three strains such as ETL-12, ETL-14 and ETL-16 were 
relatively less efficient to remove color of the dye at different dye concentration compared to ETL-1 and ETL-2. However, like ETL-1 and ETL-2, they also showed maximum decolorization of the dye at 
250 mg L
-1 dye concentrations. The rate of deocorization by these three 
strains was also significantly lower at other dye concentrations such 
as 50, 100, 200 and 500 mg dye L-1. In general, strain ETL-16 was least 
effective to decolorize Reactive Black at all concentrations of the dye.
Effect of carbon and co-substrate
The data regarding the effect of different carbon sources such 
as yeast extract, maltose, mannitol and glucose on decolorization of Reactive Black azo dye by bacterial isolates are presented in figure 3. 
Maximum decolorization of Reactive Black by the selected five strains 
of bacteria was observed when yeast extract at the rate of 4 g L
-1 was 
applied to the liquid medium containing 250 mg L-1 dye. Decolorization 
ranged between 80 to 100% in 24 h. Once again, strain ETL-1 showed the most promising results and completely removed color of the dye in 
the presence of yeast extract in liquid medium. Next effective strain was 
ETL-2. However, decolorization rate by all the tested strains reduced significantly when other carbon sources such as mannitol, glucose and maltose were applied as co-substrates. The decolorization of the dye 
was 20 to 30% in the broth medium supplemented with glucose, while it 
ranged 10 to 20% when mannitol was used as a co-substrate. However, rate of decolorization by all the tested strains was lowest when maltose was supplied as a carbon source. Maximum decolorization of up to 10% was observed in the presence of maltose. In general, strain ETL-
1 performed best at all carbon sources, however significant difference 
with other strains was observed only in the presence of yeast extract.
pH
Selected strains of bacteria were able to decolorize the dye over a 
wide range of pH. However, maximum decolorization by all the tested 
strains was recorded at pH 7 (Figure 4). Decolorization of the dye ranged from 80 to 100% at this pH. A significant increase in decolorization was observed as the pH increased from 4 to 7. However, relatively a rapid decrease in decolorization was found when pH was increased from 7 to 9. Overall, decolorization ranged from 60 to 75% at pH 5, 65 to 85% at pH 6, 80 to 100% at pH 7, 45 to 70% at pH 8 and 20 to 60% at pH 9. The strain ETL-1 was the most efficient in decolorizing Reactive Black at all levels of pH, followed by strain ETL-2. Decolorization rate of both strains was significantly different from that of ETL-12, ETL-14 and ETL-16 strains at all pH levels. In general, pH 7 favored all tested strains to decolorize the dye.
Temperature
Incubation temperature ranging from 25 to 42°C was used to find 
out optimal temperature for the decolorization of azo dyes by the selected strains of bacteria in liquid medium. It was observed that an increase in the temperature from 25 to 35°C had positive effect on the decolorization of Reactive Black (Figure 5). There was a significant 
increase in the decolorization of dye by all the strains with the increase in temperature. Optimal temperature to decolorize Reactive Black azo 
dye for all the tested strains was 32°C. However, decolorization rate in all strains dropped sharply as the temperature increased from 32 to 
40°C. After that, there was a significant decrease in the decolorization 
of dye as the temperature increased from 40 to 42°C. Overall, strain 
ETL-1 performed best at all tested temperatures and differed markedly from other strains in terms of decolorization of azo dye. In genera l,

a similar trend was observed in case of temperature regarding the decolorization potential of different bacterial strains as it was observed in case of other environmental factors.
Rate of decolorization of reactive black
Figure 6 revealed that bacterial strain ETL-1 was the most significant 
strain in decolorizing Reactive Black azo dye and caused 80, 95 and 
100% decolorization in 2, 4 and 6 h, respectively. A similar trend was 
observed in case of strain ETL-2 that was able to completely remove 250 mg dye L
-1 in 6 h under static conditions. Rate of decolorization 
was relatively slower in strains ETL-12, ETL-14 and ETL-16 compared 
to ETL-1 and ETL-2. Strain ETL-12 was able to decolorize about 90% 
dye in 6 h and 100% in 8 h. It was followed by the strain ETL-14 which caused 85% decolorization in 6 h, while it could decolorize 100% dye 
in 8 h. The strain ETL-16 was found to be the least efficient decolorizer 
of the dye among the tested strains. Overall, a sharp increase in the decolorization of Reactive Black by all tested strains was observed in first 
2 h and then there was a gradual increase in the rate of decolorization. 
However, a complete removal of 100 mg dye L
-1 was achieved in 6-8 h 
under static conditions. 
Discussion
Industrial effluent is not stable and it varies often in a wide range 
depending upon the process practiced. South Asian countries are 
experiencing severe environmental problems due to rapid 
industrialization. This phenomenon is very common where the polluting industries like textile dyeing, leather tanning, paper and pulp 
processing, sugar manufacturing, etc. thrive as clusters. Among these 
the Textile industries are large industrial consumers of waters as well as producers of wastewater. The effluent discharged by this industry leads 
to serious pollution of groundwater and soils and ultimately affects the 
livelihood of the poor [27]. In this study, isolation of bacteria was carried out from dye-contaminated wastewater of textile industry by 
using Reactive Black as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen. The 
results demonstrated that the bacterial strains isolated through enrichment of liquid media with this dye were capable of decolorizing 
Reactive Black azo dye under static conditions but with highly variable 
potential. Out of eighty four isolates, only 2% were able to remove >80% color of the azo dye, 60% strains showed 51 to 80% decolorization 
while remaining 38% isolates were less efficient in decolorizing Reactive 
Black azo dye. Various researchers have also reported a highly variable potential of different strains of bacteria to decolorize different azo dyes 
[28,29]. It was found that the bacterial strain ETL-1 ( Klebsiella oxytoca) 
was the most efficient and completely removed 100 mg L
-1 of Reactive 
Black in 6 h. Both the strains were identified based on biochemical characterization. This may imply that certain bacteria can be effectively 
used for the removal of Reactive Black from textile industrial effluen t. Other researchers have also reported the high potential of some bacteria 
to decolorize test azo dyes [30]. Since the incubation was carried out under the static conditions continuously, it is highly likely that 
azoreductases was the key enzyme, which decolorized the Reactive 
Black. Azoreductase is reported to be the key enzyme expressed in azo-
dye-degrading bacteria and catalyses the reductive cleavage of the azo bond. Azoreductase activity had been identified in several species of bacteria, such as Caulobacter subvibrioides strain C7-D, Xenophilius 
azovorans KF46F, Pigmentiphaga kullae K24, Enterobacter agglomerans, 
Enterococcus faecalis, P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Shewanella 
putrefaciens, Pseudomonas luteola, Aeromonas hydrophila and P. 
hauseri [30-34]. It was further noted that the decolorization of Reactive 
Black was concentration dependent and maximum biodecolorization 
by all four bacterial strains was observed at 250 mg dye L
-1 liquid 
medium when yeast extract was applied at the rate of 0.4% as a co-
substrate. Decolorization rate of all the four strains reduced when the 
concentration of dyes was either less or more than 250 mg L-1 liquid 
medium. Relatively low rate of decolorization of the dyes at the 
concentration less than 250 mg L-1 might be due to the fact that the 
enzymatic system involved in this reaction remained unsaturated at 
this substrate level or bacterial growth was not optimum at this level. 
On the other hand decrease in decolorization at high substrate 
concentration might be due to the toxic effect of the dye against the 
bacterial growth or enzymatic activity responsible for the degradation 
of the dye. Previous investigations have shown that the dye 
concentration does affect the rate of biodegradation and the optimum 
dye level could also vary from species to species, and in general higher 
color removal efficiencies have been observed at medium dye concentrations [26,29,35-37]. In this study, different carbon & nitrogen 
sources including yeast extract, mannitol, maltose and glucose were 
investigated for their impact on the decolorization of Reactive Black by 
the selected bacterial culture. Among these, only yeast extract supported 
the biodegradation reaction while mannitol, maltose and glucose 
suppressed the reaction of decolorization by the inocula. This might be 
due to enhanced enzymatic activity in the presence of yeast extract, 
while the other three carbon sources might have negative impact on the 
enzymatic system involved in the reaction. It is also very likely that addition of mannitol, maltose and glucose might have switched away 
inoculum from the target substrate (Reactive Black). Guo et al. [38] 
reported that bacterial strains grew well and completely decolorized 
K-2BP when yeast extract or peptone was present in the medium; 
however, glucose, glycerol, sucrose, lactose and starch resulted in lower 
rates of growth and decolorization of these dyes. Other researchers also 
have reported the maximum decolorization of azo dyes in presence of 
yeast extract by the bacteria they used [39]. The effect of glucose on 
decolorization and degradation of azo dyes by bacterial strains is controversial because some scientists [40] reported positive effect of 
glucose on the decolorization while other group of scientists [11,41] 
had opposite opinion. The negative effect of glucose on anoxic decolorization has been attributed either to a decrease in pH due to 
acid formation, or to catabolic repression [11]. It is also very likely that the positive or negative effect of glucose on the decolorization of azo 
dyes by microbial culture may depend on the concentration of glucose 
used to amend the media. Another limiting factor for microbial 
activities and azo dye decolorization is the pH of medium. Optimum 
pH varies among microbial strains and type of azo dye. Generally bacterial strains perform well in alkaline pH, while fungal strains prefer 
acidic pH. In our study it was noticed that an increase in pH from 4 to 
8 significantly enhanced the rate of decolorization. However, 
decolorization rate was the highest between 7-8 pH. Beyond pH 8, a 
decrease in decolorization by all selected bacterial strains (ETL-1, ET L-020406080100120

2, ETL-12, ETL-14 & ETL-16) was observed. The pH 7 was proved to be the best pH for all selected isolates and decolorization up to 100% was observed in case of ETL-1 and ETL-2 at this pH. So from this study it 
could be concluded that the neutral pH supported bacterial activity to 
decolorize Reactive Black in liquid medium. Textile effluent has 
alkaline pH due to substantial presence of salts during dying process. High pH level of textile effluents is one of problems in their biological treatment. Therefore, tolerance to high pH is important to make this 
technology valuable. Prasad et al. [42] reported that Bacillus 
endophyticus VITABR13 strain can effectively decolorize azo dyes over 
a wide range of pH (6-9). However, optimum pH for growth and 
decolorization was found to be 8 because maximum decolorization 
(90%) was recorded at this pH. It is also likely that pH might also have 
affected the enzymatic activity involved in decolorization of dye, in 
addition to the cellular growth of inocula. Incubation temperature is also one of the most important parameters to study biotreatment of wastewater, as it determines the growth rate of inocula and has the 
impact on specific enzymatic activity. Decolorization of Reactive Black 
by the selected isolates was investigated over a temperature range of 
25–42°C. Increase in temperature from 25 to 35°C caused increase in decolorization. Similarly further rise in temperature from 35°C to onward had negative effect on decolorization of Reactive Black. Decrease in decolorization at higher temperature may be due to the thermal deactivation of the enzyme responsible for decolorization. It is very likely that all selected isolates were mesophilic bacteria because they all showed better decolorization in the temperature range of 25 to 35°C. Previously, Guo et al. [38] reported optimum range of temperature of 28 to 35°C for the decolorization of dye contaminated by the inocula. The percentage of decolorization reached the highest value of 98% at 32°C. Over a range of 20–42°C, the specific decolorization rate increased as the temperature rose. The mesophilic range is traditionally used [43] since it is generally thought that maintaining high temperature would be uneconomical, while degradation within the psychrophilic range is too slow. Fortunately, a wide range of bacteria degrade organic pollutants efficiently in mesophilic range.
Conclusion
The present study reveals that the selected four cultures can be used 
successfully for decolorizing Reactive Black dye. The cultures exhibited maximum decolorization ability at pH between 7-8 and 32°C.Moreover, 4 g/L yeast extract was found to be optimum for decolorization. In conclusion, bacterial species can be studied further for bioremediation of dye-polluted waters including rate of degradation of azo dyes.
