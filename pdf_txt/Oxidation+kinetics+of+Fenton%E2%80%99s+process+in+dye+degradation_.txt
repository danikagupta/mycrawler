abstract
Fenton oxidation method was employed in Acid Red B (AR B) wastewater treatment, and the degra-
dation process was monitored by means of online spectrophotometry. Under the optimal experimental 
reaction conditions determined by response surface methodology (RSM), we analyzed the reaction kinetics of AR B degradation, evaluated the biodegradability of the treated AR B wastewater, and 
preliminarily probed the possible AR B degradation mechanism using UV-Vis spectrum analysis 
and ion chromatography analysis. AR B concentration was 25 mg/L in the simulated wastewater, the reaction time and reaction temperature were set at 300 s and 20°C, respectively, in the Fenton 
treatment process. Analysis of the RSM result showed that (1) the optimum reaction conditions were 
H
2O2 dosage (3.56 mmol/L), Fe2+ dosage (0.35 mmol/L), pH (2.63), under which the color removal 
rate could reach 96.8%. (2) The Fenton reaction process included two reaction stages, that is, rapid degradation stage (reaction time < 10 s) and slow degradation stage (reaction time > 10 s). Both stages followed the first-order reaction kinetics, and the reaction rate constants (K ) were 0.159 and 0.0030 s
–1 
for rapid and slow stage, respectively. (3) Fenton reaction would significantly improve the biode-gradability of AR B dye wastewater. (4) When the reaction time proceeded for 300 s, Fenton process 
could successfully destroy the molecular structure of AR B, rather than completely mineralize them.

1. Introduction
Organic dye wastewater (ODW), characterized by the 
low pH value, high chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 
salt content, poor biodegradability and complex compo-
sition, is one of the main harmful industrial wastewaters [1,2]. The quality and quantity of the ODW varied con-
siderably, and its chromaticity is about tens of thousands 
to hundreds of thousands of times. ODW is difficult to treat by conventional methods, and the aromatic agents, metals and chlorides contained in it are toxic to aquatic organisms, human beings and even biosphere [3]. The dis-charge of untreated high concentration ODW will induce the excessive consumption of dissolved oxygen in natural water and reduce the water transparency [4], which may deteriorate the aquatic habitats, harm the living organ-isms, and seriously damage the urban landscape. Once the organic dye contaminated water is used for irrigation, 413 A. Li et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 216 (2021) 412–422
it is bound to reduce the crop yields leading to economic 
losses. Moreover, when the contaminants deposit in the 
aquatic sediment, they may produce toxic gases and hence 
pollute the atmospheric environment [5]. Because of their 
stable chemical properties, organic dyes present similar eco-chemical behaviors and toxicological characteristics of 
persistent organic pollutants after entering environmen-
tal media such as water and soil. Briefly, contaminants in 
ODW can migrate and transform in water–soil–plant sys-
tem, impairing the whole ecosystems and human health. Therefore, it is urgent to treat the ODW effectively in order 
to avoid the pollution and destruction of water resources, 
alleviate the serious shortage of water resources, and pro-
tect the ecological environment and human health in China.
The advanced oxidation technologies are widely 
applied in degradation of organic contaminants in indus-
trial wastewater [6–12]. Hydroxyl radicals (
•OH), having 
strong oxidation ability, are generated during the oxidation 
process. They can convert some organic macromolecules into nontoxic and harmless, biodegradable low-molecu-lar substances, and hence improve the biodegradability of wastewater [7]. The advanced oxidation processes can degrade pollutants efficiently and have low selectivity to target contaminants [13]; furthermore, the catalyst con-sumption is low, and consequently it will not produce sludge during the oxidation reaction. In Fenton process [14,16], 
•OH generated through the reaction of H2O2 and 
Fe2+ (Fe2+ + H2O2 → Fe3+ + •OH + OH–), can oxidize and 
degrade pollutants in wastewater, transforming organic pollutants into CO
2 and H2O. Fenton oxidation (Fe2+/H2O2/
H+) technology has received intensive attention in waste-
water treatment due to its superior degradation efficiency, rapid reaction speed and moderate investment [15]. Under certain acidic conditions, Fe
2+ is oxidized by H2O2 to form 
Fe3+; •OH and OH− [2] can produce highly reactive •OH, and 
thereby destroy the molecular structure of organic dyes, achieving the aim of dye wastewater decolorization. 
Online spectrophotometric monitoring technology 
is an accurate, fast and convenient method for detecting instantaneous absorbance variation of dye at continu-ous reaction time during ODW treatment [5,9]. The key part of the device is special flow pool colorimetric dish in UV-Vis spectrometer. It is connected to a peristaltic pump and a reactor, and then the reactant can be continuously degraded and goes through measuring instruments. Thus, it can record the instant mass concentration change of the dye [9,16] and monitor the instantaneous state of the dye decolorization during the Fenton oxidation process. The experimental values are accurate.
Response surface methodology (RSM), comprising a 
collection of mathematical statistical methods [17,18], has been proved as an effective approach to explore the effects of independent variables and their interactions [19–21]. RSM can discriminate the sample points in the actual exper -
iment and fit the continuous response surface function. Compared with the orthogonal test merely dealing with discrete values, RSM determines the optimum experimen-tal conditions according to the accurate regression equation and has good predictive ability [22,23]. RSM was employed to investigate the optimum experimental conditions for degrading Acid Red B (AR B) dye via Fenton process, and predict the optimal degradation rate of AR B. Online spec-trophotometry system was applied to record the real-time reaction process. Based on the RSM results, we studied the reaction kinetics in AR B removal, evaluated the biodegrad-ability of the treated AR B wastewater, and explored the potential AR B degradation mechanism preliminarily using UV-vis spectrum analysis and ion chromatography analysis.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemical reagents
The chemical structure of AR B is presented in Fig. 1. 
The AR B was purchased from Shijiazhuang Dyestuffs 
Company (China). Ferrous sulfate (FeSO
4·7H2O) and 
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were purchased from Tianjin 
Damao Chemical Reagent Company (Tianjin, China). 
Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was purchased from Tianjin Senchang Reagent Factory (Tianjin, China). Sulfuric acid (H
2SO4) was purchased from Modern Chemical Reagent 
Company (Shijiazhuang, China). All chemicals used were of reagent analytical grade. The simulated AR B wastewater was configured with ultrapure water.
2.2. Experimental procedure
The online spectrophotometry experiment device con-
sisted of three parts: reaction device, photometric measur -
ing device and data recording device. The reaction device 
was composed of magnetic agitator and reaction beaker. The photometric measuring device was comprised by peri-staltic pump, UV-Vis spectrometer (UNICO 2802, Shanghai, China) and special colorimetric dish. A computer was utilized to record the absorbance data. The flow rate of peristaltic pump was set at 0.5 mL/s. The data recording frequency and duration was 1 Hz and 300 s, respectively. Fenton oxidation process was performed in a 500 mL vessel. The simulated ODW was pumped into the cuvette of UV-Vis spectropho-tometer by peristaltic pump. The optimum experimental conditions were determined via RSM. The COD and BOD
5 
apparatus were used for measuring the biodegradability. UV-Vis spectroscopy and ion chromatography (IC) were employed to analyze the AR B degradation mechanism.

2.3. Feasibility analysis of online monitoring technology
The simulated AR B wastewater was scanned at 200–
800 nm and the absorbance peak was around 515 nm. The 
fitted standard curve is shown in Fig. 2. The simulated 
AR B wastewater and AR B (Fe2+ + Fe3+ + H+) were scanned 
at 200–800 nm. The results are given in Fig. 3. The wave-forms and absorption coincide at 400–600 nm, so online spectrophotometric monitoring at 515 nm is feasi-ble. The linear relationship between the absorbance (A) at 515 nm and the AR B concentration (C) could be  
described by the function: A = 0.02689C + 0.0049 (R
2 = 0.99995).
2.4. Experimental condition optimized by RSM
The selected variables and their numerical ranges were 
selected according to our previous single factor experi-
mental analysis. In this study, Box–Behnken design (BBD) 
was used for choosing the optimal reaction conditions (Fe2+ dosage, H2O2 dosage, and pH value) of the Fenton oxi-
dation process for the AR B wastewater. To construct the response surface model, three variables with three levels, that is, Fe
2+ dosage (0.2, 0.3, 0.4 mmol/L), H2O2 dosage (2, 3, 
4 mmol/L), and pH value (2, 2.5, 3), were set as indepen-dent variables; and dye degradation rate was set as response variable. BBD was implemented in Design-Expert Software 
(version 10.0, Stat-Ease Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). Levels 
of each factor were represented as –1, 0, +1 indicating low, 
intermediate and high values, respectively. The levels and codes of BBD factors are displayed in Table 1. The BBD matrix of the 17 AR B wastewater treatment experiment  
is demonstrated in Table 2. The variables were coded 
according to Eq. (1):
Xxx

where Xi is the coded value of the independent variable; 
xi is the actual value of the independent variable; x0 is the 
actual value of the independent variable at center point; 
and ∆x is the step change value of the independent variable. 
To predict the optimized conditions, a second-order poly-nomial model was fitted to portray the relationship between independent variables and the response. The quadratic equation is shown in Eq. (2) as follows:

where η is the predicted response; β0 is the intercept;

cross- product coefficients; and β11, β22, β33 are the quadratic 
coefficients.
3. Results and discussion
Based on the results of previous single factor exper -
iment, the optimal experimental conditions for treating 
AR B wastewater using Fenton oxidation could be sum-marized as follows: Fe
2+ concentration is 0.3 mmol/L, H2O2 
concentration is 3 mmol/L and pH value is 2.5. Additionally, 
combining the results of single-factor analysis and Fenton reaction mechanism analysis, we would find some signif-icant interactions among these foregoing factors, imply-ing that the removal rate of AR B must be controlled by the covariation of the selected factors.

3.1. Response surface experimental analysis
3.1.1. ANOV A analysis
The matching degree and the significance of each coef-
ficient of binary regression equation can be obtained more 
clearly and the validity of model matching. Analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) was performed to evaluate the signifi-cance of the regression model and the parameters. The AR 
B degradation rate, corresponding to the 17 designed exper -
imental points, is presented in Table 2, ranging from 64.00% 
to 96.86%. The regression analysis adopts mathematical 
statistics methods to establish regression equation between inﬂuencing factors and prediction value on the basis of 
a large number of the collected response variable data. 
ANOVA is used to made signiﬁcant test for the mean dif-
ference of two or more samples. According to the ANOVA 
results listed in Table 3, the regression model, shown in Eq. (3), was reliable (p  < 0.001) for determining the optimal 
experimental conditions of AR B wastewater treatment by  
Fenton oxidation.
The Prob. > F  in model is less than 0.0001 and the model 
fits well. The missing fitting item Prob. > F -value is 0.8253, 
being higher than the test level (0.05), and this indicates that 
the fitting item Prob. > F -value of the prediction model is 
not significant. Therefore, this model can be used to ana-lyze and predict the condition optimization test for the 
Fenton oxidation of AR B wastewater. The response value 
and the variables were predicted by the following Eq. (3):

Compared with traditional experimental design method, 
RSM is superior in identifying the impact of interactions 
between variables on experimental index. During the AR 
B wastewater treatment process using Fenton reagents, we examined the influences of variable interactions on decol-orization rate, while keeping other variables at the optimal 
levels. The schematic diagram of the influence of Fe
2+ con-
centration and pH interaction analysis on the removal rate of AR B is shown in Fig. 4. Other conditions are H
2O2 dos-
age of 3.56 mmol/L, reaction temperature of 20°C, and AR B 
dosage of 25 mg/L in 300 s. As shown in Table 3 and Fig. 4, pH value and Fe
2+ concentration jointly controlled the AR B 
degradation rate. The removal rate reached the maximum at 
pH value of 2.63, which is similar to the results of a single- 
factor experiment, and Fe2+ concentration of 0.35 mmol/L. 
It has been proved that pH value plays an important 
role in determining the Fenton oxidation efficiency [24]. The contour plot and response surface plot of the inter -
action between Fe
2+ concentration and pH show that the 
removal rate trends of AR B when Fe2+ concentration is 
within the range of 0.2–0.4 mmol/L and pH is in the range of 2–4. It is shown that the degradation rate of wastewater increases as pH is from 2 to 2.63. But the further addition of pH to 4 would result in decreasing the degradation rate. Therefore, pH of 2.63 was believed as the optimum value for Fenton oxidation. This is similar to the single factor result. When the pH was lower than 2.63 in the experiment, the 
•OH might be consumed by excessive hydrogen ion (•OH 
+ H+ + e– → H2O) [25], thus decreasing the degradation rate; 
when the pH was higher than 2.63, the Fenton-oxidation capacity decreased as well, due to the self-decomposition

of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the deactivation of fer -
rous catalyst, which will conduct the generation of fer -
ric hydroxide complexes and thereby reduce the amount 
of •OH radical [26], the Fenton oxidizing ability also 
decreased. These results showed that the Fenton oxidation had the best activity in a weakly acidic environment.
With pH increasing from 2 to 4, Fe
2+ concentration 
increases from 0.2 to 0.35 mmol/L, and the removal rate of 
AR B increases. However, the degradation rate of AR B in 
wastewater decreased till the Fe2+ concentration exceeded the 
threshold level (0.35 mmol/L), implying that redundant Fe2+ 
probably inhibited the decolorization of AR B during Fenton oxidation process. This may be because the excess ferrous ion (Fe
2+) tends to compete the hydroxyl radical •OH with the 
dye molecules (Fe2+ + •OH → Fe3+ + OH–) [16,25]. Therefore, 
the Fe2+ dosage of 0.35 mmol/L can be chosen as an opti-
mum dosage for efficient AR B degradation from aqueous solutions. The response surface graph shows the signi ficant 
interaction between Fe
2+ concentration and pH value.3.1.3. Interaction analysis of other factors
The interaction between H2O2 concentration and pH 
value and between H2O2 concentration and Fe2+ concen-
tration is not significant (Fig. 5). This is the same as the 
response surface ANOVA result. The possible reason for this phenomenon is that the horizontal span of H
2O2 concentra-
tion may be too small as the response surface experiment level was designed.
3.1.4. Process optimization and model verification
By using the model simulation and analytical prediction 
of the Design-Expert 10 software, the boundary conditions 
were obtained from the results of the optimal experimental conditions, as shown in Table 4. The above boundary condi -
tions were applied to make the model prediction, and the 
predicted optimal values are H
2O2 of 3.56 mmol/L, pH of 
2.63, and Fe2+ of 0.35 mmol/L, and the degradation rate of Table 3

97.02% (96.2% of confidence degree). Three parallel exper -
iments were carried out to verify the optimal experimental 
conditions predicted by the RSM. The average removal rate of AR B was 96.80% (Table 5), remarkably close to the pre-dicted value (97.02%). Consequently, RSM is suitable for pre-dicting the Fenton oxidation effect of AR B dye wastewater.
3.2. Reaction kinetics analysis
It is of great significance to study the characteristics of 
Fenton reaction kinetics in ODW degradation, which can 
reveal the Fenton reaction process in essence, optimize 
the experimental conditions. It is of great significance to scientific research and practical application. To analyze the reaction kinetics of the AR B degradation, the online 
spectrophotometry system was utilized for monitoring 
the absorbance variation with time, under the optimal reaction conditions. The reaction process, as presented in 
Fig. 6, included two stages: the rapid reaction phase in the first 10 s and the subsequent slow degradation phase.
The reaction order of each reaction stage was deter -
mined by scrutinizing the relationship between concen-tration and reaction time. First-order reaction kinetics was more appropriate for depicting both reaction stages. Specifically, the correlation coefficient (CC) and the rate constant (K ) were 0.98938 and 0.159 s
–1, respectively, in the 
rapid reaction phase (Fig. 7–9; Table 6); and the CC and K were 0.99563 and 0.0030 s
–1 in the slow reaction phase 
(Fig. 10–12; Table 7). 
We studied the effects of Fe2+, H2O2 concentration, 
and pH on the reaction rate constant. When other con-ditions remain constant, the first-order and second-order reaction kinetic model fitting results (Fe
2+) of the rapid 
degradation stage under different Fe2+ concentrations are Table 4

shown in Fig. 13 and 14, respectively. The fitting results 
of H2O2 and pH impact factors were also given in figures 
under the same operating conditions. The fitting correla-
tion coefficient ( R2) comparison shows that the first-or -
der reaction kinetic model can describe the AR B reac-
tion kinetic degradation process well. The R2 ranges of 
first-order reaction kinetic model are about 0.93–0.98 for Fe2+, 0.94–0.97 for H2O2, and 0.98–0.99 for pH, and these 
of second-order reaction kinetics are about 0.80–0.88 for Fe
2+, 0.84–0.95 for H2O2, and 0.94–0.95 for pH, respec-
tively. Therefore, the first-order reaction kinetics model is used to describe the reaction kinetics of AR B degradation process more accurately.Table 5

3.3. Biochemical characteristic analysis
Treatment of ODW is a great challenge due to its poor 
biodegradability. Fenton oxidation, as a pretreatment 
method, has been confirmed to improve the biodegrad-
ability of ODW. In the simulated wastewater with the AR B concentration of 25 mg/L, the initial COD and BOD
5 con-
centrations were, respectively, 11.29 and 2 mg/L (BOD5/
COD = 0.18 < 0.3), indicating a low biodegradability. After pretreated by Fenton reagents, of which the reaction concentration was optimized by RSM, the BOD
5/COD ratio 
elevated to 0.72 (8.28 mg/L of COD and 6 mg/L of BOD5), 
suggesting that the wastewater biodegradability was greatly improved. Fenton oxidation method is, therefore, practicable as a pretreatment approach in AR B wastewater degradation.

Understanding the degradation mechanism is essential 
in advancing the treatment effect and efficiency. The UV-vis Table 6

spectrogram of the raw and treated AR B wastewater, 
shown in Fig. 15, could help reveal the transformation pro-cess of AR B dye during the Fenton treatment. First, there was a sharp absorption peak at 400–700 nm in the initial AR B wastewater, hinting the existence of aromatic group or the chromogenic group (–N=N–). The absorption peak, however, disappeared after a 300-s treatment with Fenton reagents, demonstrating that the chemical structure of AR B dye has been destroyed. Second, the absorbance peak in ultraviolet region, which was even higher in the treated AR B wastewater, probably implies the generation of some intermediate products in the Fenton reaction. Lastly, although the molecular structure of AR B was damaged after the treatment, it might transform into other organic state

(such as nitro), rather than been completely mineralized 
into NO3– and NO2–, because these elements were not identi-
fied in the treated wastewater by ion chromatography (IC). The mineralization rate of AR B wastewater was 26.7% after a 300 s treatment with Fenton reagents. The specific inter -
mediate products of degradation need to be further studied.
4. Conclusions
Fenton reagent can degrade the ODW, and the reac-
tion process is feasible and effective to be monitored in real 
time by online spectrophotometric system. Based on the 
optimum experimental conditions for treating AR B waste-water determined by RSM, we discussed the reaction kinet-ics of the degradation process, the biodegradability of the 
treated ODW, and the potential degradation mechanism. 
The key findings of this study are summarized as follows:
• According to the RSM analysis results, the degradation 
rate could reach 97.02%, and the optimum conditions for degrading the AR B wastewater by Fenton oxidation process were determined as 0.35 mmol/L for FeSO
4 con-
centration, 3.56 mmol/L for H2O2 concentration, and 2.63 
for pH value. The experiment result under the optimum level of each variable was 96.80%, indicating that the difference between experimental data and model pre-diction was only 0.22%, thus confirming the reliability of RSM in experimental design and prediction.
• Fenton oxidation process in treating the ODW consisted of two stages, that is, rapid degradation stage (reac-tion time < 10 s) and slow degradation stage (reaction time > 10 s). Both stages followed the first-order reac-tion kinetics, but their K-values were quite different, which was 0.159 and 0.0030 s
–1 in the rapid and slow 
degradation stage, respectively.
• The biodegradability of AR B wastewater was improved after the Fenton oxidation treatment.
• By analyzing the characteristics of AR B wastewater before and after the Fenton treatment using UV-Vis spectrum and IC, we found that Fenton process could merely destruct the molecular structure of AR B rather than completely mineralize it, when the reaction time reached 300 s. The degradation intermediate products, however, remain to be identified in the future.
