TO THE USERS OF CMA’S WASTE MINIMIZATION RESOURCE MANUAL 
The Chemical Hanufacturers Association (CMA) has a long-term commitment to 
minimizing waste generation and reducing the release of pollutants into the. 
environment. This effort includes our Air Quality Policy, our Waste 
Minimization Program, and our recently Board-approved Chemical Release 
Reduction Policy and Program. CMA’s Environmental Management Committee 
bas developed this manual to assist you in the expansion or development of 
your company’s waste minimization program. 
Your “conimi€Xent- -of jiZtsiwi.11 -‘prove 
beneficial in a number of ways: (1) reduction of operating and raw material 
costs; (2) reduction of occupational risks associated with waste handling 
and community risks associated with waste transport; (3) reduction of waste 
disposal costs; (4) avoidance of waste management regulatory burdens and 
the potential future liability of waste disposal; and (5) response to 
public concern to reduce waste generation and disposal. -- - -- 
The 1984 Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments aPready require each 
hazardous waste generator to establish and implement R waste minimization 
program and report biennially on its waste minimization efforts. The 
annual reporting of SARA Section 313 releases is another reason for 
voluntary industry waste minimization activities. Voluntary actions can 
also be effective in advocacy opposing additional Federal and State 
legislation with more proscriptive requirements, such as mandated 
reductions, efficiency standards, continuous monitoring, mass balance, and 
product bans. 
While some industry initiatives to minimize wastes and rediice releases are 
already in place, it is more important than ever thst we encourage 
additional voluntary initiatives. It is only through action that we can 
demonstrate how responsive industry commitments are benefiting the public 
and our industry. No one knows better than you how wastes are generated at 
your facilities, and no ona will have better ideas on how to minimize those 
wastes. 
I wish YOU all good luck in this significant endesvor. If there is 
anything CHA can do to assist your efforts, please feel free to contact us.

Competitive advantage. 
t obvious ntifiable economic incentive is 
uced waste management costs that can result 
simply from having less waste to manage. The 
Congressional budget office has estimated that the annual 
April 1989 3- 1 Operations 
3-2 cost to industry of hazardous waste management was 
between $4.2 and $5.8 billion in 1983 and will be between 
$8.4 and $11.2 billion by 1990 (Bergeson, 1988, p. 88). 
PIenty of direct waste management costs are available for 
"ization. Depending on the individual site and its 
operations, these savings might be achieved through one 
or more of the following: 
e Lower on-site handling costs. 
o Less waste storage area (hence, more available

o Lower paperwork and record-keeping costs.

Pub!ic Image ate minimization is very attractive to the 
public-everyone supports it and any effort involving it 
projects a positive image of the organization's concern for 
the community and the environment. Waste minimization 
provides industrial firms with the unique opportunity to: 
1) meet regulatory requirements, 2) realize economic 
fits, and 3) obtain a positive public image-all at the

and involvement is an important incentive for companies 
to participate in waste minimization activities. Waste 
minimization projects can give employees a sense: of 
individual contribution not only to the company but to 
society and their community. This, in turn, not oniy 
improves employee morale but also generates a 
perception in the community thz: the company is a good 
Product 
Improvement lity can be a natural outgrowth of 
waste minimization evaluation. Any time a process or unit 
is investigated closely in a new manner, by a variety of 
people, opportunities emerge' for improvements that 
might not otherwise have been discovered. In one case, 
waste minimization efforts created a new process

use consistint units of measurement to 
track each parameter. This may be difficult in that 
different sites or operations may use different u 
track these parameters. For example, one plant 
measure production in pounds, while another uses the 
number of pieces produced. A meaningful production 
index (e.g., lb waste/lb product) is not generally available 
for multi-product manufacturing facilities with combined 
waste streams. Further, in this case, waste minimization 
progress cannot be determined from the diffrence in 
generation rates between any two years. It is hqx"t 
for companies to keep records of the quantitative results 
of all waste minmization projects. Tracking the results of 
waste minimization projects could include all media and 
costs.

they can contain are included in Figures 5-1 through 5-5 
on the following pages. 
Figure 5-1 uses variance analysis to compare the amount 
of waste (both hazardous and nonhazardous) generated 
versus product produced in a base year (1984) and the 
current year (1986 in this case). Results are reported in 
percent increase or decrease between the years. For 
example, production increased 37 percent between 
1984 and 1986, while the total generated increased 
only a little over 20 percent. Therefore, the-hazardous __ ally decreased over 25

Information is given for production, hazardous and 
nonhazardous waste treated or disposed on- and 
and the cost. By looking at this report management 
could quickly see that total disposal costs increased 
nearly $2 million (38 percent), and that the disposal cost 
per ton increased from $159 in 1986 to $312 in 1987 (97 
percent). Differences in disposal and treatment methods

by factors such as the size, resources, and goals of each

Assessing

April 1989 This type of graph permits a quick comparison of various 
options. It depicts the effective cost per ton of reduction 
and can assist management in deciding where funds can 
be best spent to achieve a particular reduction. For

tor in the cost of potential future liability 
e management methods is not a 
ward issue. Clearly, when options of equal cost 
are being compared, the alternative that ranks higher on 
the waste management hierarchy ought to be given 
preference, since potential liability generally is lower for 
these options.

conjunction with other dired costs and capital expenses to 
arrive at a NPV. 
Another approach to comparing alternatives with varying 
liabilities is to apply an "environmental risk factor" to the 
operating costs. For instance, comparative factors such as 
those shown in Table 6-1 can be used for various 
alternatives within the waste management hierarchy.

I me liabilities associated with these wast 
options increase in approximately tihis proportion because 
of increased handling and transportation risks, lack of 
direct control by the generator, and persistence of 
constituents. Using this factor, which is applied to the 
anticipated operating cost of an option, can be thought of 
as an insurance premium required for use of that 
technology. A NPV can then be determined based on the 
erating costs and any other expenses or capital 
costs. This approach is easy to me and quickly allows for 
alitative comparison of alternatives. 
The example in TabIe 6-2 demonstrates how the 
environmental risk factor might be applied to three 
different cases.

Momentum sometimes slows because the goals 
set for the program have been achieved-sometimes it 
slows because the goals have not been achieved. If this 
happens, goals should be evaluated. 
If you determine that the goals for your waste 
minimization program are being achieved quickly and 
then the program wanes, it is probably time to set higher 
goals. The only really helpful goals are those that make us 
stretch. If a goal is too easy t.0 achieve, minimal effort will 
be expended; the goal will be achieved, but little real 
progress will have been made. If the goal established for 
the program looks almost impossible based on past 
performance, then just possibly it is the right goal. More 
effort will be expended, and even if the goal is not met, 
the result should be better than that of meeting a goal that 
was too low. 
Remember that penalties must not be assessed if a goal is 
not met. The effort expended should always be praised.

firms usually require fairly constant composition and

se requirements are becoming less restrictive as 
competition between recovery firms increases along with 
pressure to avoid using treatment and disposal. 
The basic recycling options vary depending on which , either the generator or the recycler, gets the 
led material. In most cases, the recycler markets the 
recycled materials. 
Off-site facilities recycle a variety of commodities such as 
solvents, paper, metals, and plastics.

concern for boiler corrosion. 
All firms have the option of using commercial fuels- 
blending programs. These fuel programs are usually run 
in conjunction with treatment or incineration firms. These 
firms blend a variety of high-Btu wastes with varying 
compositions, from a number of generators, to produce a
