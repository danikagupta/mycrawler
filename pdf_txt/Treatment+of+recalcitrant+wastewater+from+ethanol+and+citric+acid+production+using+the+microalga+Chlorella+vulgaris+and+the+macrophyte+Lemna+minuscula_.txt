Abstract
Laboratory-scale experiments were performed to develop a procedure for biological treatment of recalcitrant
anaerobic industrial efﬂuent (from ethanol and citric acid production) using ﬁrst the microalga Chlorella vulgaris
followed by the macrophyte Lemna minuscula . This recalcitrant dark-colored wastewater, containing high levels of
organicmatterandlowpH,preventsthegrowthofmicroalgaeandmacrophytes,andtherefore,couldnotbetreatedby
them.Therefore,thewastewaterwasdilutedto10%oftheoriginalconcentrationwithwashwaterfromtheproductionline. Within 4 days of incubation in the wastewater, C. vulgaris population grew from 5 /C210
5to 2/C2106cells/mL. This
culture reduced ammonium ion (71.6%), phosphorus (28%), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) (61%), and
dissolved a ﬂoating microbial bioﬁlm after 5 days of incubation. Consequently, L. minuscule was able to grow in the
treated wastewater (from 7 to 14g/bioreactor after 6 days), precipitated the microalgal cells (by shading the culture),and reduced other organic matter and color (up to 52%) after an additional 6 days of incubation. However, L.
minuscula did not improve removal of nutrients. This study demonstrates the feasibility of combining microalgae and
macrophytesforbioremediationofrecalcitrant industrialwastewater. r2002ElsevierScienceLtd.All rightsreserved.

1. Introduction
The composition of industrial wastewater varies
greatly.Sometimes,severaldifferentindustriesdischarge
their wastewater into a large communal pool or lake [1],
making the wastewater more difﬁcult to treat. Eachwastewater pond is therefore, unique and treatment ﬁrst
requiresasurveyofpossiblewaste-degradingorganisms.
The industrial wastewater used in this study came fromthree different sources and its main characteristic wasthat it was recalcitrant because it inhibits the growth of
both macrophytes and microalgae, even after anaerobic
treatment by bacteria.
In the common procedure for wastewater treatment,
after primary treatment to eliminate mainly suspended
solids, the wastewater is treated microbiologically(stabilization ponds or activated sludge), to further
eliminate solids and organic matter. Degradation of
organic matter produces an excess of nutrients in thewastewater. These nutrients are usually treated chemi-
cally. In recent years, there has been a growing interest
in developing biological systems based on microalgaeand macrophytes that are less expensive and more‘‘environmentally friendly’’ [2]. Bacteriological, micro-
algal, and macrophyte treatments are complementary.

PII: S0043-1354(02)00143-4Whilethebacterialpopulationinitiallydegradesorganic
matter, macrophytes eliminate suspended organic mat-
ter by trapping, ﬂocculating, and precipitating solid
particles. The microalgae adsorb molecules (nutrientsand toxins) released during the other processes. Thus,
thereisanadvantageofcombiningseveralorganisms,in
tandem, to treat recalcitrant water. In this view, the aimof this study was to evaluate a sequential treatment ofmicroalgae and macrophytes as potential treatments for
recalcitrant anaerobic industrial efﬂuent.
Macrophytes (aquatic ﬂoating or rooted plants
growing in wetlands) are commonly used in artiﬁcial
wetland constructions for treatment of wastewater [3],
domestic sewage treatment [4], and also in treatingindustrial efﬂuent [5]. Macrophytes are capable of
removing many heavy metals [6], organic matter, and
suspended solids [7], and to some extent, nutrients suchas nitrogen and phosphorus [8] from wetland waters.
Many species of macrophytes are used forwastewater
treatment. Species selection depends mainly on theavailability of the species, their photosynthetic rate,and tolerance to the wastewater [5]. One of the most
commonly used aquatic plant families is Lemnaceae
(duckweed), particularly the edible, small, ﬂoatingLemna gibba [9].Lemnaspecies have a high capacity
to adsorb nutrients from water and it is easy to manage
in the ponds because of its small size [2].
Microalgae of various species are used for tertiary
wastewater treatment [10], most often species of
Chlorella (Chlorophyceae) [11]. Chlorella species can
remove various phosphorus and nitrogen compounds[12,13], heavy metals [14], and toxic residues from
wastewater [15]. A signiﬁcant technical difﬁculty result-
ing from this procedure is the elimination of the largepopulation of microalgae that develops in the water
during the treatment. Such large amount of suspended
solids limits reuse of the wastewater. A mixture ofmicroalgae and macrophyes, as a single wastewater
treatment, is normally unfavorable for the microalgae;
the dense growth of the ﬂoating macrophyte on thewetland surface results in a sharp decrease in the
penetration of light through the water [16], which
potentially minimizes microalgal activities. Thus, amacrophyte treatment might eliminate the living popu-lation of microalgae from the wastewater.
All thesefeatureswereusedtodevelopandevaluate a
sequential treatment for recalcitrant wastewater by twoaquatic photosynthetic organisms.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Industrial wastewater
The industrial wastewater used in this study was a
mixtureoftwodifferentefﬂuentsfromalargesugarmill(Sucromiles S.A., Cali, Colombia) that processes mo-
lasses to produce citric acid, ethanol, acetic acid, and
various acetates. The ﬁrst efﬂuent used (E1) was the
untreated washing water from all the processes in themill. This includes efﬂuents from the ion-exchange
equipment used for production of citric acid (COD,
1000–2000mg/L; unstable pH of 2–4), which also has asigniﬁcant ﬂoating layer composed of: (mg/L) lipids,180, non-reducing sugars 2.36, oil 17, protein 180, and
short chain aliphatic hydrocarbons (C-7 or C-8). The
unidentiﬁed bacteria in the efﬂuent exceeded 10
11cfu/g.
The mill potentially produces 340m3/h of this wash
water.
Thesecondefﬂuent(E2)hadthreedifferentorigins:(i)
vinasse, a common by-product from the distillation of
molasses into ethanol, acetic acid, and acetate, and the
major pollutant of the liquor industries [17]. Vinassewastewater from the mill under study had a high COD
(80,000mg/L) and low pH (3.7–4.5). During its anaero-
bic decomposition after discharge into rivers andstreams, it causes massive die-out of organisms (plants,microfauna, and microﬂora) and unpleasant odors and
gases. The common treatment of vinasse (by Sucromiles
Industries, the source of the wastewater) is anaerobicdigestion for 29.5 days with a ﬂow of 800m
3/day. (ii)
Efﬂuent produced during citric acid puriﬁcation from
sugar. The two efﬂuents from this production line (oneacidicandonebasic)arecombined(productioncapacity
of 8–12m
3/h). This efﬂuent contains high levels of salts,
low pH (3.5–4), and a COD of 10,000mg/L. (iii)Domestic sewage from the plant. All three efﬂuents arecombined, and treated simultaneously by two consecu-
tive anaerobic reactors at the plant. However, this dark-
colored, anaerobically treated efﬂuent (E2) still containshigh level of contaminants; biological oxygen demand
(BOD) 1393mg/L, COD 13,471mg/L, and total sus-
pended solids (TSS) 1397mg/L with low pH. The millproduces a total of 1780m
3/day of efﬂuent, which is
currentlydischargedintoRioPalmirainCali,Colombia
without further treatment. Therefore, additional treat-mentisrequiredtoimprovethequalityofthedischarged
water.
2.2. Organisms
Microalgae:Themicroalgae Chlorella vulgaris (Beijer-
inck) (UTEX 2714) and Scenedesmus acutus (Meyen)
Chodat were isolated from the secondary efﬂuent of a
wastewater treatment stabilization pond [12].
Macrophytes: Five free-ﬂoating aquatic plants were
collected from unpolluted, natural ponds and streams
around Santafe de Bogota, Colombia, and wereevaluated for possible growth in the wastewater:
Eichhornia crassipes (Mart) Solms (water hyacinth),
Azolla ﬁliculoides Lam (water fern), Salvinia rotundifoliaL.T. Valderrama et al. / Water Research 36 (2002) 4185–4192 4186Willd(water fern), Lemna minuscula Herter(duckweed),
and Wolfﬁa columbiana Karsten (duckweed).
2.3. Culture media
The aquatic plants were routinely maintained for 15
days before experiments in 12 Plexiglass transparently
covered, concrete tanks (200L each, 360m2surface
area) at an ambient temperature of 23 711C, with 11h
of light per day (30 mEm/C02), in a commercial hydro-
ponic solution (HidroCOLJAPs, Colombia). Growth
medialosttoevaporationwasreplacedevery7dayswith
distilledwater toavoidchangingthe nutrientconcentra-tion of the solutions.
C. vulgaris cultures were stored and maintained in a
synthetic mineral solution (C30) under illuminatingconditions and S. acutus was grown on bold-mineral
medium [12]. Before the experiments, the cultures were
acclimatized in ﬁltered (S&S 595 ﬁlter paper (0.45 mm),
185mm in diameter, Schlicher and Schuell, Germany),sterile (autoclaved 20min) wastewater (E2:E1, 1:10, v/v)
inErlenmeyerﬂasksfor15days,atambienttemperature
(23711C), under continuous ﬂuorescent illumination
(60mmols
/C01m/C02), and were bubble-aerated using a
small commercial aquarium pump. This allowed the
microalgae to increase its population to the neededinoculation level by avoiding predation by protozoan
alwaysresidinginthewastewater.Theinitialcapacityof
the two microalgal species to remove nutrients was ﬁrstevaluated in round bioreactors (3L volume, 2L
substrate [12]) in the mineral salt fraction of synthetic
wastewater (composition (mg/L): NaCl, 7; CaCl
2,4 ;
MgSO4/C17H2O, 2; KH 2PO4, 21; K 2HPO4, 8.5; Na 2H-
PO4,33.4;NH 4Cl,10)beforeexposuretothewastewater
used in this study.
2.4. Incubation of organisms in wastewater
Batch experiments were carried out in two different
bioreactors. For microalgae, a 16.5L, triangular,
inverted, transparent, acrylic bioreactor (60 /C223.3/C2
33cm3, width/length/height, containing 5L of solution)
with a continuous aeration at the bottom tip (silicon
tubing with holes connected to an ambient air supply).For macrophyte growth, microalgal treated wastewaterwas introduced to rectangular, glass bioreactors
(15/C230/C240cm
3width/length/height) with a capacity
of 18L (6L of solution). The microalgal inoculumwas 20% (v/v) of the wastewater with an approximate
concentration of 0.5–1.0 /C210
6cells/mL [12], and for
macrophytes the initial inoculum was 7g freshweight per bioreactor [18]. The macrophytes and
microalgae were incubated under the conditions de-
scribed above.2.5. Analytical determinations
For water analysis, 150mL of wastewater was
analyzed in the four replicates and control bioreactors.Ammonium ion and phosphorus concentrations, BOD,
COD, TSS, and color of 100mL wastewater samples
were taken every 48h and analyzed using standardmethods [19]. The ﬂoating layer was collected andanalyzed both as it was and after lyophylization by two
independent analytical service laboratories (Department
of Chemistry at Pontiﬁcia, Universidad Javeriana inColombia and the Service Laboratories directorate of
the Center for Biological Research, Mexico). The
ﬂoating layer in efﬂuent E1 was analyzed for reducingand non-reducing sugars, oil, lipids, and proteins by
standard analytical methods. Hydrocarbons were eval-
uated by standard gas chromatography methods forthese substances [19]. Evaluation of bacteria in the
ﬂoating layer employed total cell counts and Gram
staining by standard techniques.
2.6. Growth measurement of the organisms
C. vulgaris proliferation was measured by taking
samples every 48h and counting the number of cells by
light microscopy using a Neubauer Hematocytometer
[20]. Growth rate ( K) was determined by the formula:
K¼ðlnNt
12lnNt0Þ=t12t0;where Nt1is the number of
thecellsatsamplingand Nt0istheinitialnumberofcells
at the beginning of the experiment [21]. Macrophytegrowth was determined by measuring fresh weight [22]
and relative growth rate (g/g*day) by the formula:
lnðP
1Þ/C0lnðP2Þ=t;where P1andP2arethefreshweights
of the plants at various times and tthe time between
sampling [23].
2.7. Statistical analysis
In each case, the results presented are from one
representative experiment. Variations in growth and ionremoval capacity between wastewater treatment experi-
ments precluded combining the data. Non-homoge-
neous wastewater composition between samples takenover a 1yr period is likely responsible for the variation.Data was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) at Po0:05 using the software package
STATISTICA (StatSoft Inc.,Tulsa, OK, USA).
3. Results
3.1. Selection of plants and dilution of wastewater
Because large volumes of wastewater must be treated,
using the lowest dilution of the wastewater is desirable
forpracticalreasons.UndilutedefﬂuentE1inhibitedtheL.T. Valderrama et al. / Water Research 36 (2002) 4185–4192 4187growth of all macrophyte species tested (but not the
growth of the microalgae), only when a thick surface
ﬂoating layer was present. Efﬂuent E2 also inhibited
growth because of its high COD and dark color, whichimpaired photosynthesis of C. vulgaris. Plant growth in
both efﬂuents was inhibited within 48h. When efﬂuent
E2 was diluted with efﬂuent E1 (E2:E1, 1:10,1:20,1:30,v/v), of the ﬁve species of macrophytes tested separatelyin batch cultures for 4–20 days, only L. minuscula
showed a positive relative growth rate (0.05g/g*day) at
1:10 (E2:E1, v/v) dilution. E. crassipes survived in all
dilutions,butdidnotgrowanddidnotremovenutrients
from the wastewater (data not shown). The other three
species of macrophytes died in all dilutions tested. Thisprocedure was repeated four times. The best wastewater
dilution for growth of L. minuscula was 1:10; hence, this
combination of macrophyte and wastewater dilutionwas used for the subsequent experiments. However,
whenever the wastewater contained a surface ﬁlm, L.
minuscula plantsdidnotgrow,regardlessofthedilution.
L. minuscula growth was slow and limited in waste-
water compared to growth in a hydroponic solution
(12g vs. 32g biomass per bioreactor after 20 days, and
relative growth rate of 0.03 vs. 0.07g/g*day). Thequalityofthewaterafterthemacrophytetreatmentonly
marginally improved. Between the treated wastewater
dilutions(1:10vs.1:30),CODdifferedonlyalittle(from1400 to 1000mg/L after 20 days [1:10, 40% reduction]
and from 700 to 500mg/L [1:30, 40% reduction]).
Suspended solids were similarly reduced ( o40mg/L
after 20 days), and there was no effect on phosphorusremoval, pH, dissolved organic matter, or water
conductivity.
The microalgal species were selected after seven
experiments (four with S. acutus and three with C.
vulgaris). Batch cultures were done in ﬁve replicates
(250mLsubstrate,10%inoculumvolume,8days)underthe conditions used for synthetic wastewater. Screening
experiments on synthetic wastewater with both micro-
algae showed the growth of C. vulgaris was more
consistent during 7 days of the experiment (growth rate
of 0.51–0.53). Both microalgal species removed ammo-
nium ions efﬁciently (from 3.5 to 0.04mg/L, 96–99%removal). Nitrate and nitrite ions were not affected.Phosphate ions were removed only by C. vulgaris (from
3.5 to 2.5mg/L, removal of up to 27%). Based on the
above screening experiments, the organisms selected forthe study in wastewater treatment were the microalga
C. vulgaris andthemacrophyte L. minuscula indilutions
similar to those used by the macrophyte.
Becausewastewatersamples(efﬂuentE1)wereusually
covered with a ﬂoating ﬁlm of lipids, oil, sugars,
hydrocarbons, and large amounts of attached micro-organisms (composition in materials and methods) that
preventedthegrowthofthemacrophyte,thewastewater
was ﬁrst treated with the microalga, which is notaffected by the ﬁlm. Then the macrophyte was used as
a further wastewater treatment. At the end of the
microalgal treatment, the surface ﬁlm was completely
dissolved into the bulk of the wastewater. Thus, it wasimpossibletoanalyzeifitsingredientsweremetabolized.
The wastewater contained abundant organic matter at
the time of microalgal inoculation, and microalgalgrowth at the standard inoculum level of 10% [12] wasinsufﬁcient. C. vulgaris started to grow only after 192h
of incubation, and it took an additional 30h to double
the population from 10
6to 2/C2106cells/mL. Therefore,
the microalgae inoculum level was increased to 20%
(v/v) of the treated wastewater.
3.2. Growth of C. vulgaris and L. minuscula in diluted
industrial wastewater
Growth of C. vulgaris in diluted (1:10) wastewater
(inoculum concentration at 20%) began almost imme-
diately after inoculation and increased constantly for4 days, reaching an average population density of2/C210
6cells/mL (Fig.1a). The ﬂoating layer on the
surface of the wastewater was degraded by the micro-
algae. Therefore, L. minuscula could grow in the
wastewater after microalgal treatment. The macrophyte
grew continuously for 14 days, doubling its fresh weight
after 8–10 days (Fig.1c) with a relative growth rate of0.07g/g*day, which is equivalent to the growth rate of
this species in hydroponic solutions. Using non-sterile
wastewater as a substrate supported the growth ofC. vulgaris to a lesser extent and was variable (Fig.1b,
two typical independent cycles are shown).
3.3. Removal of nutrients from diluted wastewater by C.
vulgaris treatment
Todeterminetheoptimumincubationtime(hydraulic
retention time) for a two-phase wastewater treatment,
macrophytes and microalgae were cultivated in the
wastewater for 24 days in total (10 days for microalgaeand 14 days for macrophytes). Later, most experiments
were reduced to a total of 11 days because preliminary
experiments (data not shown) showed no improvementin water quality after prolonged incubation. First,
microalgae were grown in the wastewater for 5 days.
Then the treated wastewater (including any microalgaethat developed during this period) was transferred tobioreactors containing the macrophyte L. minuscula for
an additional 6 days. Each experiment included four
replicates, where one replicate consisted of one bio-reactor inoculated with the organisms, and each experi-
ment was repeated 4 times. Controls included bioreac-
tors without microalgae, without macrophytes, andwithout any incorporated vegetation, and were main-
tained under the same incubation conditions as the
wastewater treatments.L.T. Valderrama et al. / Water Research 36 (2002) 4185–4192 4188Initially, the ammonium ion concentration in the
wastewater was high (3–8mg/L NHþ
4). Although in-
cubation of the wastewater under aerated conditions
removed ammonium ions, removal by C. vulgaris was
signiﬁcantlysuperior(Fig.2A).After5days,thelevelof
ammonium ion removal from the wastewater by C.
vulgarisranged from 60% to 78%, with an average of
72% (from four independent repetitions).
The initial concentration of phosphorus was also
high (1.5–3.5mg/L PO/C03
4). Treatment of the wastewater
with C. vulgaris gradually decreased the phosphorus
concentration, while phosphorus in the untreated
aerated water varied greatly between sampling times
(Fig.2B). The level of phosphorus ion removal fromthe treated wastewater ranged from 0% to 51%, with
an average of 28% (from four independent repetitions).
C. vulgaris treatment lowered COD after 5 days of
incubation by 61% (from 3100 to 1200mg/L inone experiment and similarly in the other two repeti-
tions).3.4. Removal of C. vulgaris from the treated wastewater
by L. minuscula
Addition of the macrophyte L. minuscula to treated
wastewater containing a large population of C. vulgaris
resulted in the dramatic elimination and sedimentation
of the microalga to the bottom of the reactors (from3.2/C210
6to 0.5 /C2106cells/mL), leaving the water
transparent and light-brown in color after 6 days of
incubation.

indigenous microﬂora, the combined microalga-macro-phyte treatment reduced these even further in four
different independent repetitions (Fig.3b,c). Macro-
phyte treatment without a microalgae pretreatmentreduced the original color up to 10.1%. In 3 of the 4experiments, the original color was reduced up to 52%
inthecombinedtreatment(Fig.3d).Therelativegrowth
rate of the macrophytes was similar in all fourexperiments and was 0.03–0.05g/g*day.
4. Discussion
Recalcitrant industrial wastewater is a serious threat
to the operation of a contaminating industry and a
challenge for cleanup. Wastewater heavily loaded with
organicmatter,suchastheindustrialwastewaterusedinthis study, cannot be cleaned by biological treatment in
artiﬁcial wetlands as the wastewater prevents aquatic
plant growth [2]. Therefore, it was ﬁrst necessary to
dilute the wastewater, and then remove nutrients andorganic matter using microalgae, before treating the
wastewater with macrophytes. This procedure is con-
trary to the one more commonly used to cleanupdomestic sewage [24]. Dilution of this recalcitrantindustrial efﬂuent with the washwater from the mill
equipment waspracticalsince the washwateristhe most
abundant efﬂuent of the plant.
Removal of ammonium ions from the industrial
wastewater in this study (73%) was lower than the
removal of ammonium ions from agroindustrial water(97%), using the same microalga species [12] and lower
than removal from domestic wastewater (91.5%) by C.
pyrenoidosa [25]. The observed removal of ammonium
ions from untreated wastewater is probably by an air-
stripping mechanism [26], as our bioreactors were well-
aerated. Removal of phosphorus from the industrialwastewater (up to 51%) was also slightly lower thanfromagroindustrialwater(59%)[12]andfromdomestic
wastewater (70–80%)[25]. Weattributed theremoval of
phosphorus from the wastewater to phosphorus accu-mulation into the algal biomass [27].
The macrophyte used in this study, L. minuscula , was
selected for its environmental ﬁtness as the sole aquaticplant species that survived in the wastewater and for its
contributiontothewastewatercleanupprocedure,albeit
toalesserextentthanthemicroalgae.Inaddition,itwasbeneﬁcial as a ﬁnal wastewater treatment because iteliminated the microalgal population from the water.
The microalgal biomass produced during the earlier
treatment is an obstacle for reuse of the water. Becausethe macrophyte grows in a dense layer on the water
surface, it prevents light from penetrating to the deeper
layers of the bioreactor and thereby prevents microalgalgrowth [2]. Other beneﬁts of the macrophyte treatment
include the reduction in water color, probably by direct
adsorption of pigment particles by the plants [28], andproductionofalargeplantbiomass,aproductvaluedby
the wastewater-producing industry for its compost
production.
The lower efﬁciency of L. minuscula in removing
organic matter from wastewater in thisstudy, compared
to the removal levels reported in the literature [29,30],
may be explained as follows: (i) The microalgal removalof organic matter is probably camouﬂaged by the
growth of the microalgal cells. In an oxidation pond,
most of the suspended solids are in fact microalgalcommunities [31]. (ii) Removal of contaminants by
ﬂoating macrophytes can be increased by harvesting the
plantsperiodically,therebykeepingtheplantpopulationin a continuous growth stage, which maximizes the rate
of contaminant removal [29]. Because of the short
duration of our treatment, this was not done in these

5. Conclusions
We are proposing a sequential treatment process for
recalcitrant industrial wastewater. First, a microalgaltreatment removes nutrients and organic matter from
wastewater and oxygen is produced for other organisms
(fungi and invertebrates) that consume the organicmatter. Secondly, macrophytes further remove organic
matter and eliminate the microalgae from the treated
wastewater.Acknowledgements
