Abstract:  Laccases are an interesting group of multi copper enzymes, whic h have 
received much attention of researchers in last decades due to th eir ability to oxidize both 
phenolic and non-phenolic lignin related compounds as well as highly rec alcitrant 
environmental pollutants. This makes these biocatalysts very us eful for their application 
in several biotechnological processes. Such applications include t he detoxification of 
industrial effluents, mostly from the paper and pulp, textile and petrochemical 
industries, polymer synthesis, bioremediation of contaminated soils , wine and beverage 
stabilization. Laccases are also used as catalysts for the  manufacture of anti-cancer 
drugs and even as ingredients in cosmetics. Recently, the utili ty of laccases has also 
been applied to nanobiotechnology. This paper reviews recent and imp ortant patents 
related to the properties, heterologous production, molecular cloning, and applications 
of laccases within different industrial fields as well as t heir potential extension to the 
nanobiotechnology area.

  3 INTRODUCTION 
Laccase (EC 1.10.3.2) is a multicopper blue oxidase that couples t he four-
electron reduction of oxygen with the oxidation of a broad range of organic substrates, 
including phenols, polyphenols, anilines, and even certain inorganic com pounds by a 
one-electron transfer mechanism [1-4]. Laccase is widely distr ibuted in higher plants 
and fungi [5] and has been found also in insects and bacteria. Recently  a novel 
polyphenol oxidase with laccase like activity was mined from a me tagenome expression 
library from bovine rumen microflora [6]. Since their discovery more than one century 
ago in the  Japanese tree Rhus vernicifera  [7], laccases have been found  to be widely 
distributed among plants, where they are involved in the synthesi s of lignin  and in the 
wounding response. Lignin,  which provides the structural component of the plant cell 
wall,  is a heterogeneous and complex biopolymer that consists of phenyl  propanoid units 
linked by various non-hydrolyzable C-C and C-O bonds [8]. For many years, it was 
thought that only the ligninolytic  system of some white-rot fungi capable of degrading 
this recalcitrant  polymer to a major extent involved lignin peroxidase (LiP) and 
manganese  peroxidase (MnP) [9]. Although the latter can only oxidize the phenolic  
components of lignin, lignin peroxidase -which has a high redox  potential- is also 
capable of cleaving the non-phenolic aromatic part. The main limi tation of all heme-
containing peroxidases is their low operational stability, mostly due to their rapid 
deactivation by hydrogen peroxide. Also, the dependence of Mn 2+  (for the MnP) or 
veratryl alcohol (for the LiP) are further shortcomings for thei r practical application. On 
the other hand, laccase alone is incapable of cleaving the non-phenolic  bonds of lignin, 
and it was not considered a significant component  of the ligninolytic system, despite the 
secretion of large quantities  of laccase by these fungi under ligninolytic conditions. 
However,  Bourbonnais and Paice [10] reported that laccases can catalyze  the oxidation  4 of non-phenolic benzylalcohols in the presence of  a redox mediator, such as 2,2'-azino-
bis-[3-ethylthiazoline-6-sulfonate] (ABTS).  This finding led to the discovery that 
laccase-mediator systems (LMS)  effectively degrade residual lignin in unbleached pulp 
[11]. Indeed, laccases produced by some wood-rotting fungi from  the genus 
Basidiomycete  play a major role in the biodegradation  of lignin [12] and have the 
capability to oxidize recalcitrant  aromatic compounds with redox potentials exceeding 
their own with the help of natural or chemical mediators [2,13]. Because of their wide 
reaction capabilities as well as the broad substrate specifi city, the laccase and the LMS 
possess great biotechnological potential. Promising applications inc lude textile-dye 
bleaching [14], pulp bleaching [15], food improvement [16], bioremediation of soils and 
water [17,18], polymer synthesis [19], and the development of biosens ors and biofuel 
cells [20,21]. 
The main aim of this work is to summarize the important paten t literature data 
that has accumulated in the recent years about the properties , heterologous production 
and molecular cloning of laccases. In addition, applications of la ccases within different 
industrial fields as well as their potential extension to the nanobi otechnology area, will 
also be discussed, particularly those appearing as published pat ents. Overall, this review 
is intended to discuss the laccases for biocatalysis and a ssociated new patents.  
PROPERTIES OF LACCASES 
Current knowledge about the structure and physico-chemical properties  of 
fungal proteins is based on the study of purified proteins. Up to now, mor e than 100 
laccases have been purified from fungi and been more or less chara cterized. The laccase 
molecule, as an active holoenzyme form, is a dimeric or tetra meric glycoprotein, usually 
containing -per monomer- four copper (Cu) atoms bound to three redox sites  (Type 1, 
Type 2 and Type 3 Cu pair). The molecular mass of the monomer rang es from about 50  5 to 100 kDa with acidic isoelectric point around pH 4.0. An important fea ture is the high 
level of glycosylation (with covalently linked carbohydrate moiet ies ranging from 10–
50% of the total weight, depending on the species or the heterologous  host), which may 
contribute to the high stability of the enzyme [22]. Several  laccase isoenzymes have 
been detected in many fungal species. More than one isoenzyme is produced in most 
white-rot fungi.  
Until recently, the three-dimensional structure of five funga l laccases has been reported: 
Coprinus cinereus  (in a copper Type 2-depleted form) [23-26], Trametes versicolor 
[1,27], Pycnoporus cinnabarinus  [28], Melanocarpus albomyces  [29] and Rigidoporus 
lignosus  [30], the latter four enzymes with a full complement of Cu i ons. Moreover, the 
three-dimensional structure of the CoA laccase from Bacillus subtilis  endospore has 
also recently been published [31,32].  
For the catalytic activity a minimum of four Cu atoms per activ e protein unit is 
needed. Three types of copper can be distinguished using UV/visible and electronic 
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Type 1 Cu at its oxid ised resting state is 
responsible for the blue colour of the protein at an absorbance of a pproximately 610 nm 
and is EPR detectable, Type 2 Cu does not confer colour but is EPR detectable and 
Type 3 Cu atoms consists of a pair of Cu atoms in a binuclear conf ormation that give a 
weak absorbance in the near UV region but no detectable EPR signal  [33]. The Type 2 
and Type 3 copper sites are close together and form a trinuclear centre that are involved 
in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme [33]. 
The redox potential of the Type 1 site has been determined for m any laccases 
using different mediators and varies from 430 mV for the laccase from R. vernicifera 
tree up to 780 mV for fungal laccase from Polyporus versicolor [3,24,34]. It was 
previously found that the catalytic efficiency ( kcat /Km) of laccases for some reducing  6 substrates depended linearly on the redox potential of the Type 1 copper, in the sense 
that the higher the potential of the Type 1 site the higher the catalytic efficiency [3]. 
That is why laccases with a high redox potential of the Type 1 si te are of special interest 
in biotechnology, e.g., for efficient bleaching and bioremediat ion processes.  
Catalysis by laccase 
To function, laccase depends on Cu atoms distributed among the three different 
binding sites. Cu atoms play an essential role in the catalytic  mechanism. There are 
three major steps in laccase catalysis. The Type 1 Cu is r educed by a reducing substrate, 
which therefore is oxidized. The electron is then transferred inte rnally from Type 1 Cu 
to a trinuclear cluster made up of the Type 2 and Type 3 Cu atoms  (Fig. 1). The O 2 
molecule is reduced to water at the trinuclear cluster.   
 
 
The O 2 molecule binds to the trinuclear cluster for asymmetric activa tion and it 
is postulated that the O 2 binding pocket appears to restrict the access of oxidizing agents  
other than O 2. H2O2 is not detected outside of laccase during steady state lacc ase 
catalysis indicating that a four electron reduction of O 2 to water is occurring [34]. A 
one-electron substrate oxidation is coupled to a four-electron reducti on of oxygen so the 
reaction mechanism cannot be straightforward. Laccase must op erate as a battery, 
storing electrons from individual substrate oxidation reaction to reduce  molecular 
oxygen. In fact, it appears that bound oxygen intermediates are al so involved [34]. 
Details of the O 2 reduction have not been fully elucidated and continue to be studied. 
From a mechanistic point of view, the reactions catalyzed by laccases for 
bioremediatory and biotechnological applications can be represented by one of the 
schemes shown in Fig. 2. The simplest case (Fig. 2a) is the one in which the substrate Place for Fig. 1  7 molecules are oxidized to the corresponding radicals by direct intera ction with the 
copper cluster. Laccases use oxygen as the electron acceptor to r emove protons from the 
phenolic hydroxyl groups. This reaction gives rise to radicals th at can spontaneously 
rearrange, which can lead to fission of C-C or C-O bonds of the al kyl side chains, or to 
cleavage of aromatic rings.  
Frequently, however, the substrates of interest cannot be oxidize d directly by 
laccases, either because they are too large to penetrate int o the enzyme active site or 
because they have a particularly high redox potential. By mimi cking nature, it is 
possible to overcome this limitation with the addition of so-called ‘ chemical mediators’, 
which are suitable compounds that act as intermediate substrates for the laccase, whose 
oxidized radical forms are able to interact with the bulky or high redox-potential 
substrate targets (Fig. 2b).  
 
 
Laccase mediator system (LMS) 
Biobleaching techniques have been intensively investigated as a poss ible alternative for 
chlorine bleaching of pulp. It is known that white-rot fungi are able  to perform lignin 
degradation using a cocktail of oxidative enzymes, including lacca ses, despite the fact 
that the bulkiness of this polymer prevents direct interaction w ith these enzymes. 
Indeed, it has been shown that the treatment of pulp with lacc ase alone does not catalyze 
the degradation of lignin but instead leads to only minor structural changes and 
repolymerization [35]. It has been hypothesized that small redox mol ecules might act as 
a sort of “electron shuttles” between the enzyme and the lignin and cause polymer de-
branching and degradation [36]. Nowadays, this is regarded as more t han just a 
hypothesis because the effect of chemical mediators, such as 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid Place for Fig. 2  8 (HAA, Fig. 3a ), on laccase-catalyzed lignin degradation has been evaluated e xtensively 
[36]. The first artificial mediator that was used in the LMS  for pulp delignification is 
ABTS (Fig. 3b ), which was introduced by Bourbonnais and Paice in 1990 [10]. Since 
then, over 100 possible mediator compounds have been tested for their abi lity to oxidize 
lignin or lignin models through the selective oxidation of their benzyl ic hydroxyl groups 
[37], and the most suitable ones are illustrated in Fig. 3. The most effective mediators 
for lignin degradation proved to be the N-heterocycles bearing N–OH groups (Fig. 3c-g) 
and in particular HBT ( N-hydroxybenzotriazole; Fig. 3c ). The process has been patented 
under the trade name ‘Lignozym ® process’, and its efficiency has been demonstrated in 
several pilot plant trials [37]. The evaluation of the performan ce of 12 different 
mediators in the oxidation of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol, used as a model substrate, 
showed that TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl; Fig. 3h ) was the most 
effective compound for this kind of reaction [37]. A number of synthetic  organic and 
inorganic mediators have been patented [36,38], and naturally occurring  “native” 
mediators for laccases have been discovered and identified [39]. M oreover, the natural 
phenolic substrates of laccases, which are part of the extract ive substances of wood, 
could also be the enhancers for the enzyme and increase the activ ity of laccase towards 
the lignin matrix during its destruction by fungi [40].  
 
 
The LMS concept was successfully applied to the oxidation of arom atic methyl 
groups, benzyl alcohols [41], polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) [18,41] and 
bleaching of textile dyes [14]. However, despite that the addit ion of mediators may 
broaden the applicability of laccase, there are two major draw backs hindering their use, 
they are expensive and are often toxic [41].  Place for Fig. 3  9 Various PAHs, which closely correlate to the 16 compounds selecte d by the 
Environmental Protection Agency (USA) and other national instituti ons as compounds 
of toxicological relevance were removed by a LMS. PAHs that we re removed included 
acenaphtylene, anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene, acenaphthene, fluoranthene,  pyrene, 
benzo(a)anthracene, chrysene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene and  
perylene [41]. PAH quinones were formed to differing degrees as  oxidation products. 
The activity of a LMS towards lignin is dependant on two main fact ors: firstly, 
the redox potential of the enzyme and, secondly, the stability and r eactivity of the 
radical are resulting from the oxidation of the mediator. It has been shown that laccases 
from different organisms react variably with different mediat ors and different substrates 
[10]. It is thus imperative that different laccases as wel l as different mediator 
compounds be investigated. 
Laccases of various origins differ in their substrate specif icities and several 
substrates should be tested to assess a laccase activity. A  very wide range of substrates 
has been shown to be oxidized by laccases (Table 1) but the catalytic constants have 
been reported mostly for a small group of substrates- e.g. the non-na tural test substrate 
ABTS and the phenolic compounds 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (2,6-DMP), guaiacol and 
syringaldazine. These constants have been measured for a large num ber of laccases, and 
rather great variation can be observed among them (Table 1).  The Km values of laccases 
are in the range of 2-5000 µM, but differences as high as 3500-fold can be seen in the 
kcat  values between different laccases with the same substrat es (Table 1). The Km values 
measured for 2,6-DMP are generally higher than those obtained w ith syringaldazine. 
The comparison of Km values also shows that laccases from different source organis ms 
have different substrate preferences [3].  Laccases in gener al combine high affinity for 
ABTS and syringaldazine with high catalytic constant, whereas  the oxidation of  10  guaiacol and DMP is considerably slower and the respective Km constants higher. On 
the other hand, the kcat  values for a single laccase do not generally differ more than 2 -
10-fold between different substrates, which reflects the fact t hat the kcat  describes the 
rate of the electron-transfer reactions taking place inside  the enzyme after substrate 
binding [3].  This can be seen, for example, for laccases from  Pleurotus sajor-caju , 
Trametes pubescens  and Trametes trogii  in Table 1.  However, the variance in assay 
conditions must always be taken into account when the catalytic constants measured in 
different laboratories are compared.  The constants in Table 1 have been measured in 
varying pH, ionic strength and temperature conditions and using differe nt protein 
concentrations, all of which have a great effect on the results . In addition, different 
molar extinction coefficients for oxidation products have sometime s been used in 
spectrophotometric assays, because the nature of the actual oxi dation products is often 
complex or poorly understood.  This affects particularly the numer ical values of kcat . 
 
 
 
Anions such as the halides, azide, cyanide and hydroxide bind to the Type 2 and 
3 Cu atoms of laccases, which disrupts the electron transfer sy stem, resulting in enzyme 
inhibition [34,42,43]. The inhibition by hydroxide generally prevents ca talysis of 
substrates at alkaline pH [2]. The inhibition of activity by  hydroxide prevents 
autoxidation at alkaline pH, with a resultant increase in stabili ty at alkaline pH [2]. The 
inhibition by halides varies according to the laccase isozyme, and  therefore likely 
related to the size of the channel of the trinuclear cluster (where oxygen binds) [2]. 
Other types of inhibitors include certain metal ions (e.g. Hg 2+ ), fatty acids, sulfhydril 
reagents, hydroxyglycine, kojic acid, and cationic quaternary amm onium detergents Place for Table 1  11  [34]. These compounds may affect the laccase by chelating the C u (II) atoms, by 
modifying of amino acid residues or they may elicit a conformati onal change in the 
glycoprotein.  
 
HETEROLOGOUS PRODUCTION OF LACCASES 
In most fungi, laccases are produced in the native hosts at leve ls that are too low 
for commercial purposes. Therefore, improving the productivity and r educing the 
production cost are the major goals for the current studies on lacca se production. 
Cloning of the laccase genes followed by heterologous expression may provide  higher 
enzyme yields. 
In order to improve laccase production, fungal laccases have been expr essed 
heterologously in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  [48,49,60-63], Trichoderma reesei  
[48,54,64], Aspergillus oryzae  [65-71], Pichia pastoris  [51,72-76], Yarrowia lipolitica  
[77], Aspergillus sojae  [78], Aspergillus niger  [52,79], Aspergillus nidulans  [69,79,80], 
Aspergillus  ficuum  [81], tobacco [82-85] and maize [86-88]. Bacterial laccases from  B. 
subtilis, Thermus thermophilus  and Streptomyces lavendulae  have been expressed in 
Escherichia coli  [44,89-91] but successful expression of fungal laccases in E. coli  has 
not been reported. 
   In spite of the fact that laccase production levels have o ften been improved 
significantly by expression in heterologous hosts, the reported levels are still rather low 
for industrial applications (Table 2). Improved laccase production levels have also been 
achieved by expression in P. pastoris , whereas expression in  
S. cerevisiae  has generally resulted in very low activity levels [92] . Recently, successful 
use of S. cerevisiae  expressing M. thermophila  laccase by directed evolution was 
reported by Bulter et al., who obtained very promising results [49] . The addition of 
copper into the culture medium also proved to be important for heterologous  laccase  12  production in P. pastoris  and Aspergillus  spp. [75,79,93]. The importance of adequate 
copper concentration for proper laccase folding was further corroborat ed by studies in 
which two genes related to copper-trafficking in T. versicolor  were overexpressed in S. 
cerevisiae  expressing T. versicolor  lacIII  gene: the heterologous laccase production by 
S. cerevisiae  was improved up to 20-fold [94,95]. The effect was suggested to r esult 
from more efficient transport of copper to the Golgi compartment [ 94,95].  Also, the 
improved laccase production levels have been obtained in heterolog ous production 
systems in a laboratory-scale fermentor cultivation by express ion of M. albomyces in  T. 
reesei , which yielded 920 mg laccase per liter [63]. Recently, an efficient 
transformation and expression system was developed for the basidi omycete P. 
cinnabarinus  and this was used to transform a laccase-deficient monokaryotic  strain 
with the homologous lac1  laccase gene. The yield obtained was as high as 1200 mg l -1 
and represents the highest laccase production reported for recombinant  fungal strains 
[96,97]. It has not been established whether production levels in a  strain that already 
produces such high levels of laccase can be further increase d by genetic modification.  
 
 
 
cDNA AND GENE SEQUENCES 
The first gene and/or cDNA sequences were recorded for laccase  from the 
Ascomycete fungus, Neurospora crassa [98], and sequences were published from 1990 
onwards. These included laccases from A. nidulans [99], Coriolus hirsutus [60,62], 
Phlebia radiata [100], Agaricus bisporus [101], P. cinnabarinus [102], Coriolus 
versicolor [103], T. versicolor [72], Podospora anserina [104], Coprinus congregatus 
[105], Ganoderma lucidum, Phlebia brevispora, Lentinula edodes and  Lentinus tigrinus Place for Table 2  13  [42,106]. Since then, the number of laccase genes sequenced has increased considerably, 
and searches from protein and gene sequence databases currently yie ld several hundreds 
of laccase gene sequences. However, a significant number of t hese are only partial 
stretches of putative laccase genes that have been found in genom e-wide sequencing 
projects and have been annotated on the basis of sequence homology with know n laccases. 
The number of laccase genes of which the corresponding protein products  have been 
experimentally characterized is significantly lower. To date, there are about 21 such 
enzymes, most of which are fungal laccases (Table 3). In addition to the genes shown in 
Table 3, several laccase genes have been characterized in detail at the nucleotide level  but 
have not been specified to code for a known laccase protein.  
The sequences mostly encode polypeptides of approximately 500 to 600 amino  
acids (including the N-terminal secretion peptide) (Table 3). All the laccases listed in 
Table 3 are secreted proteins, and typical eukaryotic signal pept ide sequences of about 21 
amino acids are found at the N-termini of the protein sequences. I n addition to the 
secretion signal sequence, laccase genes from N. crassa , P. anserina , M. thermophila  and 
C. cinereus  contain regions that code for N-terminal cleavable propeptides 
[66,69,104,107]. These laccases also have C-terminal extensions of controversial function, 
i.e. the last amino acids from the predicted amino acid sequenc e are not present in the 
mature protein [66,69,107]. 
The one cysteine and ten histidine residues involved in the binding of copper 
atoms were conserved for laccases and this is also similar t o what is found for 
sequences from ascorbate oxidase. The difference between lacc ases and ascorbate 
oxidases in the copper-binding region is that the latter exhibits the  presence of a 
methionine axial ligand, which is not present in the laccase seque nces. The  14  absence/presence of the methionine ligand has led to interesting s tudies of mutagenesis 
conducted by Xu and coworkers [108,109].   
 
 
 
APPLICATIONS OF LACCASES 
A few laccases are at present in market for textile, food and other industries, and 
more candidates are being actively developed for future commer cialization. A vast 
amount of industrial applications for laccases have been proposed and they include pulp 
and paper, textile, organic synthesis, environmental, food, pharma ceuticals and 
nanobiotechnology. Being specific, energy-saving, and biodegradable, lac case-based 
biocatalysts fit well with the development of highly efficient , sustainable, and eco-
friendly industries.  
PULP AND PAPER INDUSTRY  
In the industrial preparation of paper the separation and degradati on of lignin in 
wood pulp are conventionally obtained using chlorine- or oxygen-based chemica l 
oxidants. Non-chlorine bleaching of pulp with laccase was first pa tented in 1994 using 
an enzyme treatment to obtain a brighter pulp with low lignin content [119]. Oxygen 
delignification process has been industrially introduced in the last years to replace 
conventional and polluting chlorine-based methods. In spite of this new me thod, the 
pre-treatments of wood pulp with laccase can provide milder and clea ner strategies of 
delignification that also respect the integrity of cellulose [ 120-123]. Laccases are able to 
delignify pulp when they are used together with mediators [124] . Small natural low-
molecular weight compounds with high redox potential (>900 mV) called me diators 
may be used to oxidize the non-phenolic residues from the oxygen deligni fication [124]. Place for Table 3  15  The mediator is oxidized by laccase and the oxidized mediator mole cule further 
oxidizes subunits of lignin that otherwise would not be laccase substrat es [10,125]. 
Although the LMS has been studied extensively, there are still  unresolved problems 
concerning with mediator recycling, cost and toxicity. However,  some environmental 
benefits are envisaged and the fact that LMS could be easily  implemented in the 
existing bleaching sequences is seen as a major advantage that could possibly lead to a 
partial replacement of ClO 2 in pulp mills. Furthermore, the application of laccases in 
pulp-kraft bleaching may result in higher pulp yields and energy saving s. Most of 
studies have been patented about the use of LMS in the pulp-kraft  bleaching processes 
[123,126-141]. More recently, the potential of this enzyme for cross- linking and 
functionalizing ligninaceous compounds was discovered [142-145]. In another re lated 
application, laccases can be even used for deinking and decolorizing a printed paper 
[146-149]. Finally, laccases can be used for binding fiber-, particl e- and paper-boards 
[143,150-153]. However, different wood-decaying basidiomycetes have shown a highly 
variable pattern of laccase formation, and this subject requir es more detailed 
experiments [154].  
TEXTILE INDUSTRY 
Laccase is used in commercial textile applications to improve the whiteness in 
conventional bleaching of cotton and recently biostoning [155-157]. Potential be nefits 
of the application include chemicals, energy, and water sa ving. Cellulases were used to 
partially replace the load of pumice stones and laccases could bl each indigo-dyed denim 
fabrics to lighter shades [158-163]. Laccase also can be used in situ  to convert dye 
precursors for better, more efficient fabric dyeing [160,164-166]. I n the last few years, 
various patents reported on coloration achieved with laccase [164,167-173] .  16  Laccases find potential applications for cleansing, such as cloth-  and 
dishwashing [174-176]. Laccase may be included in a cleansing formula tion to 
eliminate the odor on fabrics, including cloth, sofa surface, and curtain, or in a detergent 
to eliminate the odor generated during cloth washing [70,177-179]. A paten t application 
about the use of LMS to increase the shrink resistance of wool w as published [180]. 
Also, Lantto et al. [181] found that wool fibers can be activated w ith LMS. Therefore, 
the use of laccase for anti-shrink treatment of wool seems very  attractive. 
FOOD INDUSTRY 
Many laccase substrates, such as carbohydrates, unsaturated fat ty acids, phenols, 
and thiol-containing proteins, are important components of various foods and 
beverages. Their modification by laccase may lead to new functi onality, quality 
improvement, or cost reduction [16,174]. Sometimes O 2 is detrimental to the quality or 
storage of food/beverage because of unwanted oxidation. Laccases ma y be used as O 2-
scavengers for better food packing [182].  
The flavor quality of vegetable oils can be improved with laccas e by eliminating 
dissolved oxygen [183]. Laccase can also deoxygenate food items derived partly or 
entirely from extracts of plant materials. Cacao was soa ked in solutions containing 
laccase, dried and roasted in order to improve the flavor and t aste of cacao and its 
products [184,185]. The reduction of odors with laccase is documented i n the patent 
literature [186,187]. Treatment with a fungal laccase can also be performed to enhance 
the color of a tea-based product [81,188-190]. It is also used to pe rform the cross-link of 
ferulic acid and sugar beet pectin through oxidative coupling to form g els for food 
ingredients [60,191]. Various enzymatic treatments have been propose d for fruit juice 
stabilization, among which it can be found the use of laccase [16 ,192,193]. Laccases are 
added to the dough used for producing baked products, to exert an oxidizing effe ct on  17  the dough constituents and to improve the strength of gluten structures i n dough and/or 
baked products [16,81,194].  
Wine stabilization is one of the main applications of laccase i n the food industry 
as alternative to physical-chemical adsorbents [16,195-198]. Must s and wines are 
complex mixtures of different chemical compounds, such as ethanol, organic acids 
(aroma), salts and phenolic compounds (color and taste). Polyphenol re moval must be 
selective to avoid an undesirable alteration in the wine's organol eptic characteristics. 
Laccase presents some important requirements when used for the tr eatment of 
polyphenol elimination in wines, such as stability in acid medium an d reversible 
inhibition with sulphite [199]. Laccases are also used to improve st orage life of beer. 
Haze formation in beers is a persistent problem in the brewing industry. Nucleophilic 
substitution of phenolic rings by protein sulphydryl groups may lead to a permanent 
haze that does not re-dissolve when warmed. As an alternative to the traditional 
treatment to remove the excess of polyphenols, laccase could be added to the wort 
[16,200]. Other studies of laccase application for phenolic compounds re moval have 
also been patented [185,201]. A laccase has recently been commerci alized 
(Suberzyme ®) for preparing cork stoppers for wine bottles [202].  
BIOREMEDIATION 
Laccases have many possible applications in bioremediation [159]. Laccases 
may be applied to degrade various substances such as undesirable cont aminants, by-
products, or discarded materials. Laccase may be applied to degr ade plastic waste 
having olefin units [203,204]. Likely, an oxidation of the olefin units by the LMS, could 
initiate a radical chain reaction, leading to the disintegr ation of the plastic. Also this 
LMS can be used to degrade polyurethanes [205]. LMS facilitate d the degradation of 
phenolic compounds (environmental hormones) from biphenol and alkylphenol  18  derivatives [206,207] and also the decomposition of fluorescent brig hteners [208,209]. 
Laccase may also be used to eliminate odor emitted from place s such as garbage 
disposal sites, livestock farms, or pulp mills [177,210]. Also, they could be used for 
decolorizing dye house effluents that are hardly decolorized by conve ntional sewage 
treatment plants [42,211-213]. In addition to dye house effluents, la ccases can 
decolorize waste waters from olive oil mills [214] and pulp mills  [215,216] by 
removing colored phenolic compounds.  
Another potential environmental application for laccases is the bior emediation of 
contaminated soils, as laccases and LMS are able to oxidize toxic  organic pollutants, 
such as various xenobiotics, PAHs, chlorophenols, and other contaminants  
[16,89,130,177,210,218-226]. Phenolic compounds are present in wastes from s everal 
industrial processes, as coal conversion, petroleum refining, produc tion of organic 
chemicals and olive oil production among others [227,228]. Immobilized lac case was 
found to be useful to remove phenolic and chlorinated phenolic pollutants [ 129,229-
233]. Laccase was found to be responsible for the transformation of 2,4,6-
trichlorophenol to 2,6-dichloro-1,4-hydroquinol and 2,6-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone 
[88,234]. LMSs have been also used to oxidize alkenes, carbazole, N-e thylcarbazole, 
fluorene, and dibenzothiophene [235,236]. Isoxaflutole is an herbicide ac tivated in soils 
and plants to its diketonitrile derivative, the active form of the herbicide: laccases are 
able to convert the diketonitrile into the acid [237]. Laccase can be also used to reduce 
the concentration of synthetic heterocyclic compound such as halogenate d organic 
pesticides in the soil [218]. LMS has been extensively study in the  oxidation of 
recalcitrant PAHs, main components of several ship spills. I n this sense, LMS is being 
included in several enzymatic bioremediation programs [238]. 
  19  ORGANIC SYNTHESIS 
Recently, increasing interest has been focused on the application of  laccase as a 
new biocatalyst in organic synthesis [154,239]. Laccase provided an e nvironmentally 
benign process of polymer production in air without the use of H 2O2 [240,241]. 
Laccase-catalyzed cross-linking reaction of new urushiol analogue s for the preparation 
of “artificial urushi” polymeric films (Japanese traditiona l coating) was demonstrated 
[242]. It is also mentioned that laccase induced radical polymeriz ation of acrylamide 
with or without mediator [243,244]. Laccases are also known to polymeri ze various 
amino and phenolic compounds [245-248]. Recently, to improve the production of fuel  
ethanol from renewable raw materials, laccase from T. versicolor  was expressed in S. 
cerevisiae to increase its resistance to (phenolic) fermentation inhibitors  in 
lignocellulose hydrolyzates [92]. The preparation of crosslinked enzym e aggregrates 
with aldehydes and amines had improved stability and was used in starch oxidation 
[249]. Selective oxidation of the primary hydroxyl groups of sugars us ing the LMS is 
described in patent literature dealing with the partial oxidation o f cellulose and other 
polysaccharides [250-254]. Also, LMS was used for the determina tion of monoclonal 
antibody of azelaic acid from oleic acid [255]. The enzymatic prep aration of polymeric 
polyphenols by the action of laccases has been investigated extensiv ely in the past 
decades as a viable and non-toxic alternative to the usual formalde hyde-based chemical 
production of these compounds [256-260].  
Laccase can also be used to synthesize various functional organic compounds 
including polymers with specific mechanical/electrical/optical  properties, textile dyes, 
cosmetic pigments, flavor agents, and pesticides [110,261-263]. 
 
  20  PHARMACEUTICAL SECTOR 
Many products generated by laccases are antimicrobial, detoxifying , or active 
personal-care agents. Due to their specificity and bio-based nature , potential 
applications of laccases in the field are attracting active research efforts. Laccase can be 
used in the synthesis of complex medical compounds as anesthetics, anti-inflammatory, 
antibiotics, sedatives, etc. [264-267], including triazolo(benzo)cycl oalkyl thiadiazines, 
vinblastine, mitomycin, penicillin X dimer, cephalosporins, and di merized vindoline 
[159,268,269].  
One potential application is laccase-based in situ  generation of iodine, a reagent 
widely used as disinfectant [159,270,271]. Also, laccase has bee n reported to possess 
significant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity [272] . Another laccase has 
been shown capable of fighting aceruloplasminemia (a medical condi tion of lacking 
ceruloplasmin, a multi-Cu serum oxidase whose ferroxidase activi ty regulates iron 
homeostasis) [273]. Some years ago, a new enzymatic method based o n laccase was 
developed to distinguish simultaneously morphine and codeine in drug samples injected 
into a flow detection system [274].  
A novel application field for laccases is in cosmetics. For example, laccase-
based hair dyes could be less irritant and easier to handle tha n current hair dyes 
[159,275-289]. More recently, cosmetic and dermatological preparation s containing 
proteins for skin lightening have also been developed [261,288,290-292]. Lacc ases may 
find use as deodorants for personal-hygiene products, including toothpaste , mouthwash, 
detergent, soap, and diapers [177,293-300]. Protein engineered lacca se may be used to 
reduce allergenicity [301].  
 
  21  NANOBIOTECHNOLOGY  
Nanoscience has grown rapidly in the last decade. Recently, mor e attention is 
focused on the applications of nanotechnologies. The high potential impact s of 
nanotechnology almost cover all fields of human activity (environmen tal, economy, 
industrial, clinical, health-related, etc). Nanostructure d materials (nanoparticles, 
nanotubes, and nanofibers) have been used extensively as carrying m aterials for 
biosensoring, and biofuel cells.  
A biosensor is an integrated biological-component probe with an electr onic 
transducer, thereby converting a biochemical signal into a quantifi able electrical 
response that detects, transmits and records information regarding  a physiological or 
biochemical change [302]. Some of the major attributes of a g ood biosensing system are 
its specificity, sensitivity, reliability, portability, r eal-time analysis and operation 
simplicity [302]. Thus laccases can be applied as biosensors or biore porters. A number 
of biosensors containing laccase have been developed for immunoassays , and for 
determination of glucose, aromatic amines and phenolic compounds [159,274, 303-308]. 
Laccase catalysis can be used to assay other enzymes [159,309-311].  Laccase 
covalently conjugated to a bio-binding molecule can be used as a repor ter for 
immunochemical (ELISA, Western blotting), histochemical, cyt ochemical, or nucleic 
acid-detection assays [80,159,312,313]. The bioreporter applications a re of interest for 
the high-sensitivity diagnostic field.  
In addition to biosensors, laccases could be immobilized on the cat hode of 
biofuel cells that could provide power, for example, for small  transmitter systems [314-
317]. Fuel cells are very attractive energy sources, parti cularly at micro-, mini-, 
portable-, or mobile-scale, that potentially have higher energy conversion/usage 
efficiency and lower pollution effect than any of the existing/ emerging energy sources.   22  For example, a bio-implantable electrochemical cell system f or active 
implantable medical devices is described by Choi [318]. In one e mbodiment, the fuel 
cell includes an electrode structure consisting of immobilize d anode and cathode 
enzymes deposited on nanostructured high-surface-area metal nanowire s or carbon 
nanotube electrodes (Fig. 4). The anode enzyme comprises immobilized glucose 
oxidase and the cathode enzyme comprises immobilized laccase. Gl ucose is oxidized at 
the surface of the anode and oxygen is reduced at the surface of t he cathode. The 
coupled glucose oxidation/oxygen reduction reactions provide a self-generati ng current 
source.  In another embodiment, the nanowires or carbon nanotubes, along w ith the 
adjacent surface anode and cathode electrodes, are coated with  immobilized glucose 
oxidase and immobilized laccase containing biocolloidal substrates , respectively. This 
results in the precise construction of enzyme architecture wi th control at the molecular 
level, while increasing the reactive surface area and corr esponding output power by at 
least two orders of magnitude. 
 
 
Laccase may be applied as a biocatalyst for the electrode r eactions [319-324]. 
Laccase-based miniature biological fuel cell is of particula r interest for many medical 
applications calling for a power source implanted in a human body [ 325].  
POTENTIAL NEW LACCASE-BASED BIOCATALYSTS 
Enzymatic catalysis in organic solvents has opened a new field of  
biotechnological applications of enzymes. The ability to use enzymes  in nonaqueous 
solvents greatly expands the potential scope and economic impact of bi ocatalysis. When 
biological catalysts are placed in this unnatural environment they  exhibit a number of 
remarkable novel properties such as altered stereo-selectivit y, enhanced stability and Place for Fig. 4  23  increased  rigidity [326]. There is also facilitated recovery of products and biocatalyst 
[327]. As well in the presence of organic solvents there is l ess risk of microbial 
contamination [328]. In the specific case of laccases or LMS, many of their non-natural 
substrate are hardly soluble in water (their K m values are far away from their solubility 
in aqueous media), and therefore the use of cosolvents is an indispe nsable requirement. 
However, the laccase may be denatured or it may be inhibited under  these conditions 
[329,330]. In this regard laccases can be applied in nonaqueous solution or  multiphasic 
systems. For water-immiscible organic solvents, laccase m ay be entrapped in reverse 
micelles or immobilized onto a carrier [22,159,232,331]. Preferabl y, the reverse 
micelles are used in the presence of laccase mediators to e nhance and mediate the 
laccase activity in organic solvents. Solid phase enzyme kineti cs screening in micro-
colonies provide higher throughput, better solvent resistance and easy of  handling [332]. 
In a recent investigation directed molecular evolution of laccase s was carried out for 
organic cosolvents resistance [333]. The M. thermophila  laccase expressed in S. 
cerevisiae  was engineered by in vitro  evolution in the presence of increasing 
concentrations of acetonitrile and ethanol. The turnover rates o f mutant enzymes at high 
concentrations of organic solvents were several fold improved (our  laboratory has 
already perfomed new cycles of in vitro  evolution, achieving high activities at solvent 
concentrations as high as 50 % (v/v) (unpublished material).  
CURRENT AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS 
This review summarizes the available recent and important pat ents about the 
properties, heterologous production, and molecular cloning of fungal laccase s and 
possible industrial and biotechnological use.  
Laccases are promising enzymes to replace the conventional ch emical processes 
of several industries such as the pulp and paper, textile, pharmace utical, and  24  nanobiotechnology. However, one of the problems to commercialise the u se of laccase 
is the lack of sufficient enzyme stocks. Thus, efforts have t o be made in order to achieve 
cheap overproduction of laccase in heterologous hosts, and also their m odification by 
chemical means or protein engineering, to obtain more robust, activ e and less expensive 
enzymes. Another additional problem is the cost and toxicity of red ox mediators. 
Further investigations should consider different and less polluting me diators such as the 
natural mediators produced by laccase in a bio-environment during ligni n degradation 
[13]. The current development in laccase catalysis research and the design of mediators 
along with the research on its heterologous expression opens a wide s pectrum of 
possible applications in the near future. Moreover, laccase can als o offer a simple and 
convenient alternative to using peroxidases with H 2O2, because laccases are available on 
an economically feasible scale.
