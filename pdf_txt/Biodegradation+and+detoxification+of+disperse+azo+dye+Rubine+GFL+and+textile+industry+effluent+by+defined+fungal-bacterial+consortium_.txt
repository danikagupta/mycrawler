RESUMO  
 
Os efeitos da água residual contendo corante azo no meio ambiente pode  ser devastad or. Assim, ele precisa ser 
tratado adequadamente antes de seu descarte - geralmente em corpos d'água. O lodo ativado é uma associação 
entre muitos (micro) organismos em uma comunidade, composta por bactérias aeróbias e anaeróbias e fungos que 
degra dam o corante , por meio de descoloração e mineralização. No entanto, faltam informações sobre espécies 
degradantes específicas e sua s interaç ões, o que  pode ria melhorar significativamente os tratamentos de águas 
residuais contendo corante s azo. Portanto, o  objetiv o deste estudo foi avaliar a comunidade bacteriana de uma 
amostra de lodo ativado real de indústria têxtil, por meio do isolamento e identificação de cepas de bactérias 
degradadoras d e corante azo . A dessorção/ionização a laser assistida por matriz , seguid a de espectrometria de 
massas por tempo de voo (MALDI -TOF MS),  foi a técnica utilizada para identificar uma  ampla gama de espécies 
de bactérias incluindo aeróbia ( Lysinibaciullus fusiformis ) e anaeróbia facultativa ( Escherichia coli ). Dados 
preliminares in dicaram o s maiores  potencia is de degradação  de corante  azo Reactive Red 141  (RR-141) por 
Bacillus thuringiensis  e Kosakonia radicincitans . É importante notar que este é o primeiro relato  sobre 
descoloração por K. radicincitans . Brain Heart I nfusion (BHI), glicose , e RR -141 foram usados como fontes de 
carbono. No entanto, apenas nos meios de  BHI e glicose detectou -se atividade de descoloração, indicando que o 
RR-141 não demonstrou ser uma boa fonte de carbono  para desenvolvimento bacteriológ ico. Ambas as c epas 
exibiram capacidade de descoloração, atingindo 43% de descoloração em BHI por B. thuringiensis , e 21% em 
meio mineral com glicose por K. radicincitans . O rendimento acima de 40% foi alcançado aplicando -os 
simultaneamente no mesmo meio reacional , em co ndições não otimizadas . Frente à falta de dados sobre o 
microbioma de lodo ativado e a sua influência para avanços na área de biorremediação de corantes azo de efluentes 
têxteis, este trabalho destaca a técnica de MALDI -TOF -MS para identifi cação de espécie s bacterianas isoladas de 
lodo ativado de efluente real de uma indústria têxtil . Além de avaliar a  capacidade de des color ação destas com o 
corante azo RR -141, incluindo  a Kosakonia radicincitans  - maneira inédita .

 RESUMO EXPANDIDO  
 
Introdução  
Com o aumento da demanda global por têxteis, têm-se os impactos ambientais potenciais de sua produção. A 
indústria têxtil gera, inerentemente, um alto  volume de efluente tóxico , principalmente devido aos banhos químicos 
e séries de enxágue s. Os compostos que mais chamam atenção no que tange  aos efluentes têxteis são os corantes. 
Dentre uma ampla classificação, o grupo dos corantes de nitrogênio , ou cora ntes azo,  é o mais utiliza do na indústria 
têxtil.  
Convencionalmente, os principais processos para tratar (descolorir e degradar) efluentes coloridos , com eficiência , 
são baseados em métodos físico -químicos, como adsorção, coagulação e oxidação com ozônio. Porém, os 
processos de bio degradação de corante azo s de efluente da indústria têxtil veem se destacando por apresentar 
algumas vantagens quando comparado s aos métodos físico -químicos, como custo competitivo , produtos finais não 
tóxicos , bons rendimentos , menor necessidade de consum o de água , e por apresentar uma abordagem mais 
ambientalmente favorável.  
Dentre essas técnicas, a biodegradação de corantes pelo processo de lodo ativado vem chamando atenção pela s ua 
eficiência e seu baixo custo, com relação à implantação e operação. Entretanto, a identificação do seu microbioma, 
ou seja, dos microrganismos que o compõe, é de grande relevância para o entendimento mais profundo da 
descoloração do efluente  (potencial de otimização de degradação e mecanismos) . O estudo da atividade de 
descolo ração por bactérias isoladas ainda é a rota preferida e visto como uma oportunidade para compreender  mais 
profund amente os  mecanismos de degradação, possibilitando a melhoria dos re ndimentos de descoloração.  Por 
outro lado, a avaliação de microrganismos em  consórcio pode fornecer condições de melhor desenvolvimento e 
ação degradante/descolorante  para as culturas , quando comparadas com suas performances isoladas.  
Análises de identifi cação do microbioma são, em sua maioria, baseadas em técnicas caras que env olvem vários 
experimentos e procedimentos analíticos, por exemplo, extração, purificação, separação (sequenciamento do gene 
16S rRNA e 18S rRNA), buscando compreender as característ icas fenotípicas complexas, moleculares e 
morfológicas. Esses métodos, poré m, são caros e geralmente não fornecem informações sobre a fisiologia 
microbiana.  Nesse contexto, a técnica de dessorção/ionização a laser assistida por matriz seguida de espectrome tria 
de massas por tempo de voo (MALDI -TOF MS) vem ganhando destaque , devido à sua rapidez , simplicidade de 
procedimentos  e confiabilidade dos resultados . A MALDI -TOF MS é usada para identificação de microrganismos 
em hospitais, laboratórios clínicos e até  em indústrias alimentícias. Quando comparada às metodologias 
moleculares ( baseadas no DNA bacteriano), ela requer menor quantidade de material biológico e envolve 
protocolos de preparação mais simples , tendo , portanto, grande potencial de trazer resultados promissores se 
utilizado para a identificação do microbioma de lodo ativa do. 
Portanto, este estudo teve como objetivo isolar e identificar cepas bacterianas que são capazes de descolorir o 
corante azo RR -141 de lodo ativado de uma planta de tratamento de efluente têxtil real. As duas cepas mais 
promissoras foram utilizadas e investiga das quanto a os seus  desempenho s cinético s, capacidade s de descoloração 
por espectrofotometria UV -VIS, eficiências de degradação por  HPLC -MS, fitotoxicidade e atividade enzimática. 
A microscopia eletrônic a de varredura da amostra de lodo ativado tamb ém foi executad a, para investigação da sua 
microbiota . 9 
 Objetivo geral  
Contextualizar o cenário de biodegradação de corantes azo por bactérias isoladas, com especific idade sobre aquelas  
isoladas de amostra de lodo ativado e avaliadas em relação aos seus pot enciais de descoloração  e degradação de 
corante azo , em diferentes fontes de carbono, avaliando desempenho em consórcio, a fitotoxicidade pré- e pós-
tratamento , e a atividade enzimática.  
 
Objetivos específicos  
• Descrever os impactos ambientais potenciais de  águas residuais contendo corante azo da indústria têxtil;  
• Explorar a identificação do microbioma de lodo ativado  obtido de uma indústria têxtil ; 
• Apresentar uma visão geral de culturas isoladas identificadas no contexto da degradação de corantes 
têxteis;  
• Realizar um estudo do potencial de descoloração de culturas isoladas  e em consórcio ; 
• Avalia r a degradação de corantes têxteis através das análises de HPLC -MS, fitotoxicidade, atividade 
enzim ática . 
 
Metodologia  
Foi realizada amostragem de l odo ativado do tan que de decantação secundária de uma estação de tratamento de 
indústria têxtil localizada em  Blumenau -SC, Brasil. A fração sólida foi separada e observada em microscópio 
eletrônico de varredura (HITACHI TM3030). O isolamento das diferentes culturas foi exec utado para sua posterior 
identificação pelo espectrômetro de massa MALDI -TOF -MS (Bruker Dal tonics, Alemanha). O potencial de 
descoloração do corante azo  foi avaliado por plaqueamento em  estrias e por sistema aquoso em frascos Erlenmeyer 
sob agitação, com v erificação periódica durante 7 dias, por percepção visual e medidas espectrométricas , 
respe ctivamente . As cepas selecionadas foram então avaliadas quanto ao desempenho em diferentes meios de 
cultura e fontes de carbono, tendo sua cinética também estudada. Ensaio de fitotoxicidade foi realizado com 
sementes de alface para verificar a toxicidade da solução antes e após o tratamento biológico. A 
degradação/mineralização completa e a atividade enzimática também foram investigadas por análise de HPLC -
MS e ensaio s em placas de Petri, respectivamente.  
 
Resultados e discussão  
A análise das mi crografias de microscopia eletrônica de varredura  do lodo ativado indicou a presença de uma 
matriz de biofilme aderida, muito provavelmente  de bactérias floculantes. Algumas car acterísticas importantes 
estão relacionadas à estrutura e função do biofilme, p or exemplo, compostos orgânicos como substâncias 
poliméricas extracelulares  que desempenham um papel significativo na modificação de superfície (carga, 
hidrofobicidade) para dar  condições adequadas para a conexão bacteriana  e ajudar em seus processos metab ólicos . 
MALDI -TOF -MS foi apresentado como uma boa ferramenta para identificação rápida do microbioma. Bacillus 
cereus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Bacillus thuringiensis, Kosakonia cowa nii, Lysinibacillus fusiformis, Acinetobacter 10 
 baumannii, Kosakonia radicincitan s e Escherichia coli  foram as espécies detectadas. Entre eles, Kosakonia  sp. é 
a cepa menos explorada para descoloração de corante azo . 
A triagem de culturas bacterianas  descolo rante s em meio sólido revelou colônias de K. oxytoca , B. thuringiensis , 
K. cowa nii e K. radicincitans  com maior potencial para descoloração. No entanto, a investigação em sistema 
aquoso forneceu resultados que foram  utilizados  para escolher o  B. thuringiensis  (> 40% de rendimento de 
descoloração) e K. radicincitans  (> 20% de rendimento de descoloração) para estudos posteriores.  
A análise de preferência da fonte de carbono e o estudo cinético revelaram o não desenvolvimento no  meio cuja 
fonte de carbono era ape nas o corante azo. Além disso, diferentes preferências de meios  foram detectada s para 
cada cultura bacteriana analisada. O estudo cinético revelou níveis de descoloração de 21% em meio mineral com 
glicose por K. radicinci tans e 43% em BHI por B. thuringien sis. O uso de ambas as culturas em consórcio no meio 
reacional mineral com glicose  promoveu aproximadamente 40% de descoloração, indicando o potencial uso de 
culturas bacterianas mistas como agente de biorremediação para remoção econômica de corante de efl uente têxtil. 
O ensaio de fitotoxicidade e as análises HPLC -MS sugeriram que a degradação não foi completa , favorecendo 
uma possível adsorção de corante à biomassa . Além disso, uma ação enzimática potencial foi inferida p ela 
formação de halo translúcido ob servada, que pode estar associada à produção de enzima extracelular.   
 
Considerações finais  
Os resultados obtidos neste trabalho  compõem uma importante contribuição para a biodegradação de corantes azo 
por culturas bacter ianas  isoladas de lodo ativado de indústria têxtil , incluindo a  avaliação inédita da  Kosakonia 
radicincitans .

 ABSTRACT  
 
The effluent from the textile industry is  a complex mixture of recalcitrant molecules that can harm the environment 
and human health. Biological treatments are usually applied for this type of wastewater, main ly activated sludge , 
due to its high efficiency  and low implementation and operation cos ts. However, the activated sludge microbiome 
is rarely well -known due to the variability of its origin. Some studies revealed the most usual presence of 
Acidobacteria , Bacillus , Clostridium , Pseudomonas , Proteobacte ria, and Streptococcus  in activated sludg es, and 
Bacillus  Pseudomonas  are highlighted for bacterial dye degradation. Consequently, the process is not performed 
on its optimum conditions (yield of treatment). In this sense, this review aims to contextualize  the potential 
environmental impacts of a zo dye -containing wastewater from the textile industry; evaluate its toxicity; explore 
the identification of activated sludge microbiome; and then highlights the matrix -assisted laser 
desorption/ionization time -of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI -TOF MS) as  a novel, rapid and accurate strategy 
for the identification of activated sludge microbiome (potential to enhance treatment yield).

What?  
• Investigation of dye degradation potential by isolated bacterial cultures from a textile effluen t treatment 
plant.  
Why?  
• The world consumption of dyes has been increasing, mainly due to the textile industry (colo urization of 
fibres). A massive amount of wastewater is generated , and its incorrect disposal into the environment 
harms  aquatic life.  
• Ther e is a growing interest in studying  azo dye remediation by biological pathways  due to its efficiency; 
non-toxic end products; good yields; less need for water consumption,  a more envi ronmentally friendly 
approach; and the low-cost concerning  implementation  and operation.  
• Among these techniques, the biodegradation of dyes by the activated sludge process has been attracting 
attention due to its efficiency and low cost with implantation a nd operation.  
• The study of the activated sludge microbiome for remediatio n of textile dyes requires a deeper 
understanding of which species promote the discolo uration of the effluent, and it is not widely explored.  
• Isolated cultures assays are the preferre d route and are seen as an opportunity for a deeper understanding 
of degr adation mechanisms, improving  decolo urization yields.  
Hypotheses  
• Does the MALDI -TOF MS an efficient technique to identify activated sludge microbiome?  
• Do the decolourization assays reveal promising bacterial strains for azo dye decolourization?   
• Can the  strains realize the degradation and/or the mineralization of the a zo dye?  
• Can the final  products and  effluent toxicity  de compatible with the proper discharge into the 
environment without causing damages ?

 1 STUDY OF AZO DYE DEGRADATION BY ISOLATED BACTERIA  CULTURES FROM 
ACTIVE SLUDGE OF A TEXTILE INDUSTRY  
 
1.1 INTRODUCTION  
With the increase in the global demand for textiles, there a re potential impacts o n their production. The textile 
industry inherently generates a high volume of toxic effluent, mainly due to chemical baths and rinsing series. The 
compounds that draw the most attention when dealing with textile effluents are dyes. A mong a broad classifica tion, 
the group of azo dyes, is the most used in the textile industry.  
Conventionally, the main processes to efficiently treat (discolo ur and degrade) colo ured effluents are based on 
physicochemical methods such as adsorption, coagul ation , and oxidation wi th ozone. However, the biodegradation 
processes of azo dyes in effluent from the textile industry have been highlighted for presenting some advantages 
compared to physicochemical methods . Specific cost; non -toxic end products; suitab le accessories; less ne ed for 
water consumption; and a more environmentally friendly approach  are some of the pros biological degradation . 
Among these techniques, the biodegradation of dyes by the activated sludge process has been attracting attention 
due to its efficiency and the low-cost concerning  implantation and operation. However, the study of its 
microbiome, that is, of the microorganisms that compose it, is of great generation for a deeper understanding of 
the discolo uration of the effluent (degrada tion potential and mech anisms). The study of decolo urization activity 
by fertilizers is still a preferred route and seen as an opportunity for a deeper understanding of degradation, 
enabling an improvement in decolo urization adjustments. On the other hand,  an evaluation of micro organisms in 
the consortium can provide the conditions for better development and action of cultures compared with their 
defined performances.  
Microbiome identification analy ses are mainly based on expensive techniques involving seve ral experiments and 
analytical procedures, such as extraction, purification, separation (16S rRNA and 18S rRNA gene sequencing), 
and understanding  the complex, molecular phenotypic , and morphological characteristics. These methods, 
however, are expensive a nd generally do not pro vide information about microbial physiology. In this context, the 
matrix -assisted laser desorption/ionization technique followed by time -of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI -TOF 
MS) has gained prominence due to its speed, simplicity of  procedures , and reliab ility of results. MALDI -TOF MS 
is used to identify microorganisms in hospitals, clinical laboratories , and even food industries. Compared to 
molecular methodologies (based on bacterial DNA), it requires less biological material and i nvolves simpler 
prepara tion protocols. Therefore, it has excellen t potential to bring promising results if used to identify  the 
activated sludge microbiome.  
Therefore, this study aimed to isolate and identify bacterial strains capable of discolo uring the a zo dye RR -141 
from activated sludge from a real textile wastewater treatment plant. The two most promising strains were used to 
investigate kinetic performan ce, decolo urization capacity by UV -VIS spectrophotometry, two -way HPLC -MS 
analysis, phytotoxicity , and identification of enzymatic activity. A scanning electron microscopy of the activated 
sludge sample was also performed.  
 
1.1.1 Objectives  20 
 1.1.1.1  General Objective  
Contextualize the scenario of biodegradation of azo dyes by isolated bacteria, with specificity on iso lated bacteria 
and evaluate their potential for discolo uration and degradation of an azo dye in different carbon sources, evaluating 
intercropping performanc e, pre - and post -treatment phytotoxicity, and enzymatic activity.  
 
1.1.1.2  Specific Objectives  
• Describe the  potential environmental impacts of wastewater containing azo dye from the textile industry;  
• Explore the identification of the activated sludge microbiome ob tained from a textile industry;  
• Present an overview of isolated cultures identified in the context of textile dye degradation;  
• Assessment of textile dye degradation (HPLC -MS, phytotoxicity, enzyme active) .

Abstract  
The world consumption of dyes has been increasing, mainly due to the textile indus try (colo urization of fibres). 
The textile industry generates a massive amount of wastewate r. The incorrect disposal of colo ured effluent into 
the environment leads to the derangement of aquatic life. Several techniques have been applied to reduce this 
impact, including adsorption, coagulation, filtration, among others that, on the one hand, are  efficient; on the other 
hand, require additional management (e.g., a large volume of sludge). In this sense, specific biological pathways 
for dye degradation and wa stewater discolo uration have drawn attention to the industry since they can increase 
wastew ater treatment yields. Therefore, this chapter describes the fundamental concepts of dye -containing textile 
wastewater treatments, particularly microbial and enzymat ic approaches, including the most usual textile 
wastewater treatments and their trends (mod ern technology).

2.1 INTRODUCTION  
Since the first commercially successful synthesis, dyes have been massively applied for the chemical, food, textile, 
paper, and other industries (Saratale et al., 2011) .  
Dyes can be clas sified taking into account their chromophore group (e.g., anthraquinone, azo, indigo, nitrated, 
nitro, phthalein, triphenyl) and/or their fibre interaction (e.g., acid, azoic, direct, disperse, re active, sulfur, vat) 
(Benkhaya et al. 2 017). Azo -dyes (N=N -) represent an environmental concern du e to their high demand and 
toxicity, including carcinogenic (Bafana et al. 2011) . 
The textile industries are the most dye -consumers that in herently produce many effluents with high biochemical 
oxygen  demand, turbidity, and low degradability since 10 to 15% of dyes do not remain on textile fibre s (Verma 23 
 et al. 2012; El Bouraie and El Din 2016) . These dyes are recalcitrant molecules that are harmful to the environment 
(Baban et al., 2003) . Thus, biological, physical, and chemical treatments, includin g activated sludge, oxidation, 
ozonation, membrane filtratio n, coagulation, and their combinations, are extensively applied as textile wastewaters 
(Ahmad et al. 2019; Camargo et al. 2019; Li et al. 2019c; Herrera -González et al. 2019) . However, there are 
drawbacks for each approach, such as high costs, inefficient, and generation of secondary po lluters (e.g., high 
volume of sludge).  
Regarding remediatio n of dye -contaminated water bodies, the biological processes by bacteria, fungi, algae, 
oxidative enzymes, and their combinations have been drawing attention since they are efficient and eco -frien dly, 
operates at mild, among others (El et al. 2016;  Uppala et al. 2019 ; Ooi et al. 2007; Gou et al. 2009; Bilal et al. 
2019) . In this sense, phycoremediation and genetically modified organism oxidoreductase producers are promising 
biological treatment alternatives. The in tegrated systems a re advanced oxidation processes or membran e 
bioreactors (anoxic bioreactors, aerated bioreactors, UV -unit, and granular activated carbon filters ). 
Therefore, it is essential to discuss the treatment methods for treating dye -contaminated w astewater properly . In 
this context, this chapter describes the fundamental concepts of dye -containing textile wastewater, exposing the 
nature of dye, its classification , and global market with a specific approach of azo dye. Furthermore, some 
discussions about environmental effects when improperly discharged, the conventional textile wastewater 
treatments technologies, particularly microbial and enzymatic methods, including the most usual textile 
wastewater treatments and their trends (modern technology).  
 
2.2 CHEMICAL STRUCTURE OF DYES  
Dyes and pigments are chemical  compounds widely used to impart colo ur to different substrates (fabric, fib re, 
leather, plastic, paper, etc.) (Chequer et al. 2013a; Varjani et al. 2021) . Colo ur is described as the qualitative 
perception of light discriminated b y the eyes and brain (Loe 2017; Xuan et al. 2021) . According to The Ecological 
and Toxic ological Association of Dyes and Organic Pigment Manufacturers  (2021), d yes are intensely colo ured 
or fluorescent soluble organic substances, which provides  colour to a substrate by absorption of light. These 
compounds absorb light radi ation within the ran ge of the visible region spectrum (380 to 750 nm)  whereas  they 
reflect or diffuse that radiation (Benkhaya et al. 2020) .  
Synthetic dyes are complex organic substances colo ured fluorescent (Gürses et al. 2016) . On the other hand, 
pigments are solid or particle structures composed of organic or inorganic moiety. They can be colo ured red, 
colourless (opaque) , or fluoresc ent. It is worth not ing that the last one is chemically unstable and shows low water 
solubility (Berradi et al. 2019; Pavithra et al. 2019) . In a broader sense, the difference between these compounds 
lies precise ly in how they inter act with the substrate.  
Dyes consist of two main components, chromophore and auxochrome (Temesgen et al. 2018; Berradi et al. 2019) . 
The chromophore is an unsaturated atomic group, i n which the arrangement of single and double bonds allows the 
absorption of light ; that is, the chromophore  group is responsible for adding colo ur to the substrate ; examples are: 
sulfide ( -C=S), azo ( -N=N -), carbonyl ( -C=O), and nitro ( -NO 2) (Rawat et al. 2016; Temesgen et al. 2018; Berradi 
et al. 2019) . On the other hand, the auxo chromic group contains many functional groups, such as sulfonic ( -SO 3H), 
amine ( -NH 2), hydroxyl ( -OH), and carboxylic ( -COOH), which are substituents  bound to the chromophore. They 
improve the colo ur of the material (fib re) and affect the solubility in wat er by either donating (auxochrome) or 24 
 receiving (antiauxochrome) electrons (Holkar et al. 2016; Rehman et al. 2020) . Additionally, the third component 
of the dye corresponds to the matrix, composed of benzene, anthracene, perylene rings, among others (Temesgen 
et al. 2018; Berradi et al. 2019; Benkhaya et al. 2020) . 
 
2.3 GLOBAL DYE MARKET  
 Dyes have been used since pre -history, such  as colo ur surfaces, objects , and fabrics (Cardon 2007) . Initially, 
pigment production was limited to natural sources as plants, minerals , and insects (Ferreira et al. 2004; Zerin et al. 
2020) . Later, the first dye synthesis breakthrough was made in 1743 by Barth (indigo carmine) (de Keijzer et al. 
2012) . However, in 1856, William Perkin revolutionized the dye industry by accidentally find ing a Mauveine dye 
chemical route and synthesizing (aniline p urple, CI 50245) (Abel 2012; Hagan and Poulin 2021) . Perkin's 
discovery was crucial to accelerating synthetic production  of dyes  at a global scale (Tamburini et al. 2021) . 
Synthetic dyes were introduced into the market  and applied to other industrial areas, such as paper, food, 
pharmaceutical, and  others (Tkaczyk et al. 2020) .  
Since the invention of the first synthetic dye, it is estimated that  more than 10,000 synthetic  organic dyes became 
commercially available, with an annual p roduction surplus of 700 thousand metric tons (Rawat et al. 2016; 
Katheresan et al. 2018; Sharma et al . 2021) . In the early 20th century , Europe was responsible f or the global 
production of dyes. Asian countries, particularly China and India, are the largest dye producers worldwide 
(Tkaczyk et al. 2020) . 
 
2.4 CLASSIFICATION OF TEXTILE DYES  
Since there are many synthe tic dyes and formulations, a systematic classification is essential to enhance th e textile 
industry.  
 
2.4.1 Chromophore structure and colo ur index (CI)  
Several  textile dyes can be classified according to their source, solubility, chemical structure, and applicat ion, 
among others (Tamburini et al. 2021) . The chemical structure -based classification should be correlated to 
chromophore groups as azo dyes, anthraquinone, nitro, xanthenes, and arylmethane (Ali 2010; Benkhaya et al. 
2020) . Board 1 shows some widely used synthetic organic dyes.  
In this sense,  the solubility -based classification is often used since it is low cost and, highly related to application, 
since different textile subs trates are evaluated (Berradi et al. 2019; Javai d et al. 2021; Varjani et al. 2021) , for 
instance, water -soluble dyes are acidic, basic, reactive and direct (Hassan and Carr 2018; Varjani et al. 2021) , 
whereas insoluble dyes can be classified as vat, dispersed, sulfur and azoic (Burkinshaw and Lagonika 2006; 
Hassan and Carr 2018; Ka theresan et al. 2018; Sharma et al. 2021) . 
Altern atively, textile dyes can be classified according to the Colour Index (C.I.) (Wich 1977) , in which each dye 
is assigned a Generic Colour Index Name based on the application class, colo ur, and identification co de (Gupta 
2009) . The C.I. Number is five digits  code , as shown  in Board  1 (Gupta 2009; Benkhaya et al. 2020) . 
  25 
 2.4.2 Azo-based textile dyes  
Azo compounds contain at least one nitrogen -nitrogen double bond ( ˗N=N ˗). The nitrogen is bound to aro matic 
ring groups, such as benzene, naphthalene , and heterocyclic rings (Chung 2016; Besegatto et al. 2021b; Didier de 
Vasconcelos et al. 2021) . However, many chemical structural configurations are possible. As the n umber of azo 
bonds increases in the same molecular structure, they can be named Diazo, Triazo and Polyazo (Benkhay a et al. 
2020a) . Azo dyes are brigh tly colo ured compounds, highly chemically stable, including sunlight exposure, 
biodegradation and, wash fading (Chung 2016, Vikrant et al. 2018) . These dyes can be synthe sized from the 
diazotization of aromatic amines and coupling reaction with electron -rich nucleophiles (Shankarling et al. 2017) .   
 
2.5 GLOBAL AZO DYE MARKET  
Azo dyes correspond to 70% out of the total synthetic dye market (Ali 2010; Balapu re et al. 2015) , in which the 
textile industry uses 80%, that is, 56% out of total (Oros et al. 2004; Singh et al. 2015; Sarkar et al. 2017; Tkaczyk 
et al. 2020; Varjani  et al. 2021) . 
 
2.6 EFFECTS OF AZO DYES  ON ENVIRONMENTAL  
The dyeing processes are inherently related to dye (concentration, type, etc.), the textile material (shape, type, 
etc.),  and the colo ur desired (Barker 2009; Chakraborty 2014) . Most dyes are soluble organic molecules that 
adhere to fibre s, yarns, or fabrics to impart colo ur; thus, dyes have to be highly stable to many factors su ch as 
surface -active agents (soaps a nd detergents), light exposure, among others (Chakraborty 2014; Mahapatra 2016)  
(Mahapatra 2016 , Chakraborty 2014) . In general, the dyeing procedure can be carried out in exhaust dyeing 
(batch), continuous or semi -continuous processes , involving a sequential mechanism that includ es migration, 
adsorption, and diffus ion (Clark  2011; Chequer et al. 2013b; Chakr aborty 2014) . Initially, the dye is transported 
from the dyebath onto the surface  of the fibre, followed by the dye molecule's adsorption at the surface  of the fibre. 
Finally, the dyes are diffused from the surface to t he interior of the fibre  by fixation  (Chakraborty 2014) . 
The textil e industry consumes substantial amounts of water, especially by dyeing and printing processes, which, 
in turn, are responsible for approximately 25% out of total water consumption (Arslan et al. 2016) . Further more, 
water is also required for washing dyed textile material, generating high volumes of colo ured effluents (Bisschops 
and Spanjers 2003; Patel and Vashi 2015; Arslan et al. 2016; Yaseen and Scholz 2019) . It is worth noting that dyes 
and many other chemicals such as enzymes, mineral s, and organic acids, alkalis, surfactants, salts, and oxidizin g 
agents are required in dyeing processes (Patel and Vashi 2015) . Hence, t extile wastewaters are highly com plex,  
recalcitrant , and unfeasible to treat by conventional m ethods (Arsla n et al. 2016; Hassan and Carr 2018) . 26

 The textile industries can be responsible for massive environmental impacts (Board 2) since their effluents 
are composed of enzymes, mineral and organic acids, alkalis, surfactants, salts, oxidizing agents, and dyes 
at high conce ntrations (Yaseen and Scholz 2019, Patel and Vashi 2015) . The wastewater generates in the 
dyeing mill comprises the most significant amount of the total wastewater of the textile industr y. This 
wastewater comes from the dye preparation, spent dye bath, and washing pr ocesses (Patel and Vashi 2015) .  
It is estimated that over 7 x 105 tons of synthetic dyes  are produced annually  worldwide, and during the 
colouration process of the textile industry, up to 3.105 tons of this amount are lost to wastewater (Chequer 
et al. 2013b; Neifar et al. 2019) . According to Samsami et al. (2020), the textile industry is responsible for 
54% of the total discharge of dyes into the environment (Samsami et al. 2020) .  
The dye wastewaters are intensely  coloured, posses s high biological oxygen demand (BOD), high dissolved 
solids (DS), low suspended solids (SS), high salt content, alkalinity , and low concentration of heavy metal s 
(Patel and Vashi 2015) .  
Many dyes are easily visible (naked eye) even at low concentra tions. Thus, when incorrect disposal into 
the water bodies, they will become visually unpleasan t and affect aquatic life (Yagub et al. 2014; Arslan et 
al. 2016; Neifar et al. 2019) . 
Textile  dyes are recalcitrant compounds. Thus, they can reach the aqueous ecosystem as pollutants. In 
addition, dyes can harm water quality in terms of total organic ca rbon (TOC), chemical oxygen demand 
(COD), and BOD (Dafale et al. 2010; Vikrant et al. 2018) . Furthermore, some dyes, as azo -type textile 
dyes, can be bioaccumulated in the food chain (biomagnification) (Dafale et al. 2010; Lellis et al. 2019) . 
Many synthetic textile dyes and intermediate metabolic  products can have direct and indirect toxic effects , 
mainly because of mutage nic and carcinogenic agents . (Kadirvelu et al. 2003; Yagub et al. 2014) . Thus, 
azo dyes can be correlated to animal and  human diseases such as allergies, tumors, cancers, dysfunction of 
the liver, reproductive syst em, kidney, brain, and central nervous system, and suppression of the immune 
system (Kadirvelu et al. 2000; Kadirvelu et al. 2003; Neifar et al. 2019; Aruna et al. 2021) . In this sense,  it 
is worth noting that the toxicity of azo dyes is mainly related to aromatic amines that can  be biodegradation 
products (Neifar et al. 2019) . 
Despite some azo dyes (for example, Acid Orange 7 and Reactive Red 195) have been reported as non -
toxic (Chung 2016; Rawat et al. 2016; Rawat et al. 2018) , most of them are environmenta lly hazardous 
substances (Sharma et al. 2021) . It is worth noting that these azo dyes can reach the drink ing water supply 
systems (Rawat et al. 2016) . As already mentioned, the textile industry is the major azo dye polluter  
(Kalyani et al. 2009; Besegatto et al. 2021a) . In this sense, it is estimated that between 15 to 50% of a zo 
dyes eluates (do not adsorb) from textile fibre s (Kakarndee and Nanan 2018; Lellis et al. 2019) . 
The incorrect disposal o f azo dye -containing azo is visually unpleasant (Lellis et al. 2019) , decreases 
penetration of  sunlight , and, consequently,  affects the aquatic biota, leading to lower oxygen levels (Yaseen 
and Scholz 2 016; Albahnasawi et al. 2020; Selvaraj et al. 2021) .  
The synthetic origin and molecular arrangement  of azo dyes lead to high chemical stability, including 
sunlight exposure and biodegradation (Pandey et al. 2007; Garcia -segura et al. 2011; Duarte Baumer et al. 
2018) . Therefore, in recent years, the contamination of these substances and their degradation products 
have been intensively investigated (Sun et al. 2017b; Brüschweiler and Merlot 2017;  Berradi et al. 2019; 
Rovira and Domingo 2019; Varjani et al. 2021; Didier de Vasconcelos et al. 2021) .  28 
 The accumulation of azo dyes in plants (Yaseen and Scholz 2016) , animals (Mansour et al. 2010) , water 
(Rajaguru et al . 2002; Vacchi et al. 2017) , and soil (Solís et al. 2012)  can be absorbed (oral or inhalation) 
by human beings  and, consequently, impact their health as blood disorders, colic, allergies, and skin 
irritation (Sen et al. 2016; Lellis e t al. 2019) . It is also known that prolonged exposure to these substances 
can induce carcinog enic and mutagenic effects in animal cells (Mansour et al. 2010; Parrott et al. 2016) , 
including  human s (Rafii et al. 1997; Balakrishnan et al. 2016; Rawat et al. 2016; Sen et al. 2016) . 
Furthermore, some azo dyes reveal mutagenic potential at the chromoso mal level (Rafii et al. 1997; 
Chequer et al. 2009) , inducing DNA and RNA damage.

Therefore, the commercial relevance of azo dyes is undeniable. However, their toxicity and environmental 
impact should be carefully evaluated.  
 
2.7 TEXTILE WASTEWATER CONVENTIONAL T REATMENTS  
During dy eing and printing processes, the fixation of reactive dyes on fabrics forms  a covalent bond 
between the dye molecule containing the reactive electrolytic  group and proteic  fibre   (Queiroz et al. 2019) . 
However, the linkage is insufficient - emphasizing the azo -type textile dyes , which, ar ound 15 -50%, do not 
bind to the fabric - and are released into wastewater (Rehman et al. 2018) . About 1000 -3000 m3 of sewage 
is generated per day to produce 12 -20 tons/day of a fabric product (Rehman et al. 2018; Ilyas et al. 2019) . 
Table 1  illustrates the consumption of water, chemicals, and energy for 1 kg colo ured fabric. In this sense, 
the texti le industry is recognized  among all industrial sectors as the most polluters due to the volume of 
water discharged and the environmental load generated (e.g. , high consumption of energy and chemicals, 
CO 2 emissions, and effluent production with a high rate of impurities) (Alkaya and Demirer 2014) . The 
effluent composition of various stages of a textile manufacturing  industry is shown in Board 3 . The high 
concentrations of BOD, COD, colo ur, pH, and metals hamper the treatment of these wastewaters.

Different physical -chemical and biological treatments, such as separation and concentration, 
decomposition, degradation, and exchange, are used in textile manufacturing. Therefore, it is necessary to 
combine different treatment processes to enable textile wa stewater disposal . In summary, three main 
treatment processes guide textile wastewater remediation: primary, secondary , and tertiary (Figure 1). 
Accordin g to Islam and Mostafa (2019) , suspended solid waste, excessive oil , and granular materials 
present in the effluent are removed by primary treatment. In the secondary treatment process under aerobic 
or anaerobic conditions, there is a reduction in BOD, phenol, oil contents, and colour control in the 
effluents . Electrodialy sis, reverse osmosis, and ion exchange - briefly described below – are examples of 
tertiary treatments .  
 30 
  
Figure 1: Classification of wastewater treatments.  
 
2.7.1 Primary treatment  
Before primary treatment, the textile m anufacturing i ndustry effluent processing, pre -treatment , or 
preliminary treatment must be applied to equalize the effluent, to homogenize it in terms of pollution load, 
pH, and temperature (Kumar et al. 2012) . Then, primary treatments based on screening, sedimentation , and 
flotation processes are used to r emove sediment able organic and inorganic solids.  
After primary treatment, fine suspended particles and colloidal particles are not removed efficiently ; 
therefore, mechanical flocculation and chemical coagulation processes  are effectively employed. These 
processes have the function of destabilizing colloidal particles by adding coagulating agents (e.g. , lime 
[Ca(OH) 2], alum, ferrous sulphate (FeSO 4), ferric chloride (FeCl 3), among others), which have a high 
charge/mass ratio with colloidal particles signif icantly increasing their size. This factor contributes to 
sedimentation , and the effluent can then be processed through a flocculat ion and settling tank (Kumar et al. 
2012) . Treating textile wastewater with coagulating agents helps to reduce colo ur (insoluble dyes, 70 -90%), 
suspended solids (50 -75%), BOD (2 5-50%), COD (50 -60%), and oils and grease (65%). Although, the 
addition of a coagulating agent to the wastewater stream increases the cost of this process and the sludge 
formed requires further treatment (Kumar et al. 2008) .

 2.7.2 Secondary treatment  
In secondary treatment, biodegradation has become a promising method for treating textile effluents 
compared to physicochemical processes. Besides the lower cost of the process, it is unnecessary to use 
chemical products , and the sludge produced - a result of cell proliferation - has a low content of chemical 
compounds (Rai et al. 2005) . In this process, dissolved organic compounds, remaining colloidal particles , 
and the  colour  present in wastewater are removed and/or reused to stabilize  organic matter due to the 
presence of microorganisms (Joshi et al. 2004) . The activated sludge system stands out as one of the most 
commonly used treatment methods and is divided into two categories: aerobic and anaerobic treatment 
processes.  
The aerobic process removes the biodegradable components from the effl uent (e.g., carbohydrates and 
readily degradable compounds). In other words, in this process occurs the: (I) coagulation and flocculation 
of colloidal matter, (II) oxidation of organic mat ter dissolved in carbon dioxide , and (III) degradation of 
nitrogenou s organic matter into ammonia, which is then converted into nitrite and eventually into nitrate. 
However, after this process, more complex xenobiotic compounds, such as dyes and surfactant s, remain in 
the effluent (Kumar et al. 2012; Queiroz et al. 2019)  
In anaerobic treatment, factors such as pH , temperature, waste load, absence of oxygen , and toxic material 
directly influence the efficiency of the process, which is mainly used to digest  activated sludge (Kumar et 
al. 2012) .   
Most dyes are generally recalcitrant to aerobic degradation but can undergo reductive dis colour ation under 
anaerobic condi tions (Rai et al. , 2005) . In a treatment plant, the two treatment systems are usuall y used 
together. The anaerobic system is followed by an aerobic system, producing better results, for example, the 
colour  reduction is significantly more significant than using the isolate d aerobic process (88% vs. 28%), as 
well as the reduction of Total O rganic Carbon (79 -90%) (Joshi et al. 2004; Kumar et al. 2012; Y aseen and 
Scholz 2019) . It is essential to mention that textile eff luent contains significant amounts of non -
biodegradable chemicals (e.g., amino benzene sulfonic or naphthyl amine sulfonic acids and heavy metals) 
(Kumar et al. 2012; Santoro et al. 2014; Queiroz et a l. 2019) . Since these conventional treatment systems 
are not very effective in removing pollutants, an efficient tertiary treatment process is needed.  
 
2.7.3 Tertiary treatment  
Environmental quality standards for the release of textile effluents into surface water bodies demand tertiary 
treatment. In addition to conventional treatments, textile effluents have tertiary processes to remove specific 
contaminants (e.g. , various type s of dyes such Congo Red, Methyl Orange, Methylene blue, C.I. Direct red 
80, C.I. R eactive Red 17, C.I. Direct Yellow 50, among others), as well as complete removal of solids and 
organic matter, reduce colour  or degrade recalcitrant compounds, reduce nutrients (e.g. , amm onia and 
phosphorus) and assist in effluent disinfection (Kumar et al. 2012; Queiroz et al. 2019) . 
The most c ommon tertiary treatment solutions are removing residual colour  organic compounds by 
adsorption and removal of dissolved solids by membrane filtration. Wastewater is also treated with ozone 
or another oxidizing agent to destroy many contaminants and minimi ze textile effluent disposal problems 
(Kumar et al. 2 012). 2 
  
2.8 AEROBIC AND ANAEROBIC MICROBIAL DEGRADATION OF DYES: BACTERI AL, 
FUNGAL, AND MICROALGAE  
Biological treatments have several advantages, such as implementation and operation, low costs, and high 
yields (relatively) . It can be carried out under aerobic  and/or anaerobic conditions,  reaching the complete 
mineralization a (Bhatia et al. 2017; Crini and Lichtfouse 2019; Varjani et al. 2020) .  
Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, fungi,  yeasts, and algae can be used for dy e degradation. These 
microorganisms play essential roles in environmental maintenance since they are responsible for 
metabolizing organic, inorganic, natural, or xenobiotic compounds (Gao et al. 2018) . The degradation of 
dyes can be carried out by pure cultures or microbial consortium s (Ebrahimi et al. 2019) . Mandal, Dasgupta , 
and Datta (2010)  reported that microbial consortium s present higher degradation yield s when compa red to 
pure cultures  due to synergistic metabolic actions and  higher stability (temperature and pH).  
 
2.8.1 Aerobic microbial degradation of dyes  
The required oxygen for aerobic microbial degradation can be  supplied by atmospheric air (dissolution), 
and/or pure oxygen, and/or biochemical sources. Conventional aerobic treatment systems are compacted 
bed reactors, biological filters, aerobic stabilization ponds, and activated sludge (Samuc hiwal et al. 2021; 
Behera et al. 2021) . 
The activated sludge system is the most widely used aerobic treatment for effluents in the textile industry . 
It shows shorter hydraulic holding time and higher  operational flexibility when compared to anaerobic 
treatments. However, it generates high biomass volumes (sludge) containing (adsorption) residual 
compounds that are resistant to biodegradation (Manai et al. 2016) . 
The microorganisms commonly used for the decolo urization of dyes in aerobic conditions are fungi and 
bacteria. Bacteria can grow faster than fu ngi; however, the m ore efficient microorganisms  at degrading 
synthetic dyes are white -rot fungi. White -rot fungi include Polyporus sanguineus , Daedalea flavida , 
Dichomitus squalens , and Irpex flavus  (Balamurugan et al. 2011; Nar esh et al. 2013; Behera et al. 2021) . 
Kodam et al. (2005)  realized a study showing the use of a bacterium isolated from the textile effluent to 
degrade azo sulfonated dyes. In this study, the researchers i solated and purified a pure culture called KMK 
48 from t he sludge collected in a textile dyeing industry located in India. The pure culture KMK 48 was 
efficiently degraded Reactive Red 2, Reactive Red 141, Reactive Orange 4, Reactive Orange7, and Reactive 
Violet 5.  
Balamurugan, Thi rumarimurugan , and Kannadasan (2011)  evaluated the colo ur degradation of dye -
containing textile effluent and the reduction of COD through anaerobic digestion using Halomonas 
variabilis  and Halomonas glacier . Experiments were carried out at 30 ºC in a CO 2 incubator. The maximum 
degradation was reached after 144h. Nevertheless, the aerobic treatment did not achieve  a high yield 
(Behera et al. 2021) . 
Subramanian, Ramesh , and Kalaiselvam (2014)  studied the degradation of triphenylmethane dye malachite 
green by litter decomposing fungi. In mangrove regions, the authors isolated and identified fungi ( A. flavus , 3 
 A. niger , A. terreus , F. oxysporum , Penicillium  sp.). Among the  isolated microorganisms, Aspergillus flavus  
showed greater decolo urization capacity (83%) after  9 days.  
The aerobic fungal and bacterial degra dation of textile effluents has several advantages : low cost and high 
yields (mineralization). Nevertheless, whit e-rot fungi present disadvantages of other fungi, such  as 
prolonged growth phase and retention times (up to 14 days) (Balamurugan et al. 2011; Behera et al. 2021) . 
 
2.8.2 Anaerobic microbial degradation of dyes  
The main advantage of anaerobic biological processes is the wide variety of microorganisms in the 
anaerobic consort ium. In addition,  the anaerobic processes generate biogas (energy source) (Şen and 
Demirer 2003; Behera et al. 2021) . 
Dye deg radation under anaerobic conditions is a combination of biological and chemical mechanisms. 
Anaerobic biological treatment involves an oxidation -reduction reaction with hydrogen, allowing the azo 
dye and other water -soluble dyes to be discolo ured. The deco lourization of azo dyes under anaerobic 
conditions occurs with a redox potential < 50 mV. The dye acts as an elec tron receptor . The double bond 
(-N=N -) is broken and promotes the formation of an intermediate hydrazo, which has the bond ( -N-NH-), 
which unde rgoes a reductive cleavage and produces amines. The chemical contribution to reducing and 
reducing azo dyes is at tributed to biogenic reducers such as sulfide, cysteine, ascorbate, and Fe2+ (Popli and 
Patel 2015; Bhatia et al. 2017; Gao et al. 2018) .

(Aromatic amines)  
 
Conventional anaerobic treatment systems are anaerobic lagoons, septic tanks, anaerobic filters, and high -
rate reactors, capable of receiving more significant  amounts of organic load per volumetric units, such as 
UASB reactors (upflow anaerobic sludge blanket). The anaerobic filter and UASB show high colo ur 
removal efficiency (Xu et al. 2018) . 
Anaerobic degradation of azo dye Acid Orange 7 was performed using a continuous upflow packed bed 
reactor containing biological activated carbon. The  high conversion rates of the azo dye (up to 99%)  were 
obtained using a continuous upflow packed bed reactor containing biological activated carbon. The use of 
a continuous upflow packed bed re actor containing biological activated carbon has proved to be an effective 
and promising treatment system for the d egradation of anaerobic azo dyes (Mezohegyi et al. , 2007) . 
A new method to increase anthraquinone dye reactive blue 19 degradation using the anaerobic system has 
been proposed by Cai et al. (2021)  using resuscitation -promoting factors (RPF), which has been proven to 
revitaliz e and stimulate bacterial growth. Resuscitation -promoting factors were efficient in the 
decolo urization of anthraquinone dye reactive blue 19. Compared to th e conventional methods, there was 
an increase in dye decolo urization by an additional 20% with the addition of the RPF process. The addition 
of RPF also resulted in a greater decolo urization efficiency of anthraquinone dye reactive blue 19 using 
microorgan isms of the Peptostreptococcaceae  family.  4 
 Nguyen et al. (2021)  evaluated the potential of a subme rged anaerobic deflector reactor with sponges (SS -
ABR) to improve the proce ssing performance of azo dye -containing wastewaters. The dye -degrading 
microorganisms present in the SS -ABR were Clostridium  sp. and sulfate -reducing bacteria Desulfomonile  
sp. and Desulfovibrio  sp. The efficiency of colo ur and COD removal were 65±3% and 8 3±2%. In addition, 
SS-ABR showed excellen t stability.  
 
2.8.3 Sequential Aerobic -anaerobic treatment  
The combination of anaerobic -aerobic treatments using different microorganisms has sho wn promising 
results for the degradation of dyes present in textile effluen ts. Wastewater treatment indicates that aeration 
improves COD and is an essential  complement to anaerobic colo ur removal (Shindhal et al. 2021; Ceretta 
et al. 2021) . 
You and Teng (2009)  used a sequential batch anaerobic reactor combined with an ana erobic membrane 
bioreactor to treat  azo dye (Reactive Black 5). In addition, sixty anaerobic bacteria degrading Reactive 
Black 5 dye were isolated from the sludge taken from the sequential batch anaerobic reactor. The COD 
removal was 92.3% and 5 .2%, wherea s the proper  colour removal was 74.6%, and 9.1% us ed a sequential 
batch anaerobic reactor combined with an anaerobic membrane bioreactor . Five subspecies of Lactococcus 
lactis  were sequenced and showed the ability to degrade 99% of Reactive Blac k 5 dye aft er 5.5 h. Twenty 
subspecies of Lactobacillus casei  showed the ability to degrade more than 99% of Reactive Black 5 dye 
after 36h.  
Naimabadi, Movahedian Attar, and Dhahsavani (2009)  studied the decolo urization and biological 
degradation of reactive Red 2 using an anaerobic -aerobic sequential process. A n anaerobic deflector  reactor 
on a laboratory scale and a fixed activated sludge reactor were used. The r eactors wer e operated with 
different organic loads and hydraulic retention times. The experiments were carried out in continuous mode , 
and the effluent from the anaerobic deflector  reactor was used as feed for the fixed activated sludge reactor. 
The remova l efficienc y of the COD was 54.5% using 1day -hydraulic retention in the anaerobic reactor. 
Regarding colo ur, the removal was 89.5%. The results demonstrated that the anaerobic/aerobic sequential 
system efficiently degraded  the reactive azo dye Red  2. 
 
2.9 PHYC OREMEDIATIO N 
An exciting approach for decolo urizing and removing  dyes in textile effluents is the phycoremediation 
(algae) (Bhardwaj and Bharadvaja 2021) .  
Although some azo dyes are highly toxic to fish, they do not significantly inhibit algal growth. In this sense, 
Chlore lla vulgaris , Oscillatoria , and Chlorella pyrenoidosa  degrade azo dyes (Acuner and Dilek 2004) . It 
is worth noting that algal biomass can also be used to produce  methane and/or biodiesel.  
The main advantage of phycoremediation is the algae metabolic versatility: (1) Photoautotrophic:  the 
energy (ATP) is produced from light sources and CO 2 (photosynthesis); (2) Heterotrophic: the energy is 
produced from the oxidation of org anic molecules; (3) Myxotrophic: photosynthesis and oxidation of 
organic molecules occur concurrently; and (4) Pho toheterotrophic: the energy is produced from light, and 5 
 oxidation of organic molecules (Krishnamoorthy and Manickam 2021; Sarkar and Dey 202 1; Bhardwaj 
and Bharadvaja 2021) . 
A Cosmarium  species (green alga) was studied as a viable biomaterial for the biological treatment of 
triphenylmethane dye, Malachite Green (MG). The effects of temperature, pH, dye concentration, and algae 
concentration  on dye decolo urization were studied. The highest discolo uration rates were at temperatures 
above 45 ºC. The ideal  pH was 9. Cosmarium  showed high efficiency of decolo urization, reuse, and stability 
(Daneshvar et al.  2007) . 
El-sheekh, Gharieb , and Abou -el-souod (2009)  evaluated the decolo urization and removal of ethyl red, 
orange II, G -Red (FN -3G), basic cationic, and basic fuchsin using Chlorella vulgaris , Lyngbya lagerlerimi , 
Nostoc lincki , Oscillatoria rubescens , Elkatothrix viridis , and Volvox aureus . The remova l efficiency 
ranged from ~ 4 to 95%. The basic cationic fuchsin and basic fuchsin dyes showed the greatest capacity for 
decolour ization and removal by all tested algae. Elkatothrix viridis  removed  cationic bas ic fuchsin (91.6%) 
and basic fuchsin (90.7%) dy es after three  days of incubation. The Basic Fuchsin dye removal rate was up 
to 95% using Oscillatoria rubescens . However, Volvox aureus  removed only 5.02 and 3.25% of the orange 
II and G -Red dyes.  
 
2.10 ENZYMATIC DEGRADATION OF DYES  
Enzymes are well -known as e ffective biocatalysts that promote specific bioconversion of substances under 
mild conditions (Nunes Costa et al. 2020) . Thus, considering  the recalcitrant properties of dyes from the 
textile industry, the enzymatic process is a promising alternative in reducing pollutants fro m industrial 
wastewaters.  
The enzymatic degradation of dyes  can be carried out by using crude and purified. Purified  enzymes present 
high activity per dosage . However, the presence of redox mediators at low concentration s may significantly 
impact the feas ibility of crude and purified approaches (Nguyen et al. 2016) . The purification costs are also 
a relevant drawback when applying enzymes to the degradation of d yes. In this sense, enzyme 
immobilization is an attractive  alternative since it eases recovery, protects the biocatalyst by enhancing its 
resistance, and maintains the enzyme's ability as a catalyst (Lima et al. 2017) .  
A wide range of enzymes has been used in general wastewater treatment. However, due to the recalcitrant 
characteristic of dyes, the oxidoreductase class is the most cited i n the literature for the textile industry 
field. This class includes enzymes that require an oxidizing agent (e.g., h ydrogen peroxide, chlorine , and 
potassium permanganate) to promote the catalysis of the reaction. Azoreductases, laccases, and peroxidases 
are examples of oxidoreductases commonly applied to dye degradation. In contrast,  the first one is used 
specifically on the degradation of azo dyes, the last two present activity on several classes of dyes. In this 
way, this section brings a brief descript ion related to these enzymes, their role in dye decomposition , and 
some relevant studies.    
 
2.10.1  Laccases  
Laccases are m ulticopper oxidase proteins (Singh et al. 2015) . Laccases are oxidoreductases that play  an 
essential  role in biotechnological applications in the bioremediation field d ue to their non -specific oxidation 6 
 capability, no co -factors demand, and ability to use molecular oxygen as electron acceptor (Kalyani et al. 
2012) . Laccases have attracted relevant attention in the degradation of dy es from textiles wastewater 
(Husain 2006) . When in  the presence of redox mediato rs, laccases present higher activity (Ravikumar et al. 
2013) . Fungi or plants biosynthesize  these enzymes ; nevertheless, some bacteria are laccase producers 
(Claus 2003) .     
Laccases are related to removing hyd rogen atoms from hydroxyl groups of ortho and para mono and 
polyphenolic substances and aromatic amines resulting in depolymerization, deme thylation, or quinine 
synthesis (Gonçalves and Steiner 1996). Since laccases catalysis uses molecular oxygen as an el ectron 
acceptor, laccases do not show high specificity (when compared to other enzymes). Thus, laccases oxidize 
phenolic an -phenolic compou nd also a wide range of substances, including azo dye -containing textile 
wastewaters (D’Souza et al. 2006; Sharma et al. 2007). Laccases degrade azo dyes by a nonspecific free 
radical mechanism that forms phenolic products and inhibit potentially risky aro matic amine formation 
(Wong and Yu 1999). The reaction oxidation of aromatic pollutants, such as anilines and phenols , by 
laccases, yields the formation of phenoxy radicals from its original compounds; these reactions additionally 
develop a phenolic polyme r on polymerization or, by further laccase action, produce quinine (Bollag et al. 
1992 .  
The benefits of enzyme immob ilization are well known by researchers also in the dye degradation field. 
Studies involving enzyme encapsulation on several supports for w astewater decolo urization report 
enhances enzyme activity, thermal and pH stability, reusability, and resistance to m etals and organic 
solvents (Jaiswal et al. 2016; Sun et al. 2017a; Bilal et al. 2018) . Several researchers have reported the 
activity of laccases from a variety of sources on the degradation of recalcit rant industrial dyes used in the 
textile manufacturing, as reported in Table 2. (Zhuo et al. 2019)  suggest possible pathways for the 
degradation of Malachite Green (MG) and Remazol Brillian t Blue R (RBBR) based on the intermediates 
generated. Regarding laccase -MG, there are two possible pathways: (I) laccase mediates successiv e 
demethylation , which results in the decrease of m/z value; and (II) MG is hydroxylated, then occurs the 
ring remova l and the demethylation of the dye. Based on the intermediates of RBBR degradation, the 
proposed laccase -mediated pathway breaks  the molecu le into two sub -products followed by deamination, 
hydroxylation, and oxidation , finally opening the ring.       
Sun et al. ( 2015 ) reported the immobilization of laccase in chitosan grafted polyacrylamide hydrogel and 
its application on the degradation of Acid Orange 7 (AO7, an azo dye) and Malachite Green (MG). First, 
the cationic hydrogel used as enzyme support promoted ext ra adsorption of the anionic AO7 , which 
increased the substrate concentration for the encapsulated laccase and enhanced activity. For the s econd, 
the cationic MG did not interact with the surface of the hydrogel , and the degradation occurred exclusively 
due to enzyme activity. Jaiswal, Pandey, and Dwivedi (2 016) developed an immobilized laccase in chitosan 
beads and tested its activity on indigo carmine. The results showed complete decolo urization of 50 μm.mL-
1 solution within 8h , and the supported enzyme presented 40% of its initial activity after 3 cycle s. The 
decrease in activity may be attributed to blocking  some pores on the surface of chitosan by substrate 
oxidation products (Daâssi et al. 2014) .

2.10.2  Peroxidases  
Peroxidases are widely applied for decolo urize textile effluents since they act on p henolic compounds 
(Ulson de Souza et al. 2007) . Peroxidases are hemoproteins that use oxygen peroxide as a mediator to 
catalyze oxidative reactions of recalcitrant dye compounds yielding insoluble polymeric products (Chiong 
et al. 2016) . Passardi et al. (2007)  classified peroxidases into three classes according to their origins. Class 
I are intracellular peroxidases, includi ng yeast cytochrome peroxidase , ascorbate peroxidase , and bacterial 
catalase peroxidases. Class II comprehend s the secretory fungal peroxidases such as lignin and manganese 
peroxidases that are mainly related to lignin degradatio n. Class III are secretory plant peroxidases that 
present  numerous functions such as degradation of H 2O2 and additional toxic substances from chloroplasts 
and cytosol and auto -defense against wounding.    
Huaiyan Sun et al. (2017)  immobilized horseradish peroxidase in ZnO nanowires/macroporous SiO 2 
composite and tested its activity on the decolo urization of Acid Blue 113 and Acid Black 10 dyes. The 
solution conc entration range of this study was between 30 and 50 mg.L-1, and the colo ur removal was 95% 
for Acid Blue and 90% for Acid Black. Chiong et al. (2016)  reported the application of soybean peroxidase 
and Luffa acutangula  peroxidase to degr ade azo dye methyl orange from  liquid effluents. The first presented 
degradation of 81% within 1 h and the second a decolo urization of 75% after 40 min. The results for crude 
peroxidases reveal their potential in enzymatic dye treatment.    
Bilal et al. (2019)  proposed a pathway for the degradation of Reactive Black 19 by horseradish peroxidase 
based on HPLC-MS ana lysis. The successive enzymati c action on the dye leads to the degradation of the 
chromophore group and the subsequent disappearance of the colo ur. Bilal et al. (2017)  also reported a 
pathway for the degradation of  azo dye Methyl Orange based on its UPLC -MS analysis after horseradish 
peroxidase activity. The decline in spectral shift followed by the absence of new peaks during enzymatic 
activity indicates the total degeneration of the d ye by the cleavage of azo bond s. Ali et al. (2018)  exposed 
a potential pathway for the degradation of Reactive Blue 4 by a ginger peroxidase. GC -MS was used to 
elucidate the oxidative reactions by the intermediates. The auth ors concluded that the dye was  first 9 
 desulphonated, dechlorinated , and deaminated to generate less m/z value products ; the following reactions 
lead to the cleavage of the chromophore group and consequent solution decolo urization.     
Evaluating the  toxicit y of compounds from enzymatic degradation of dyes is essential  to verify if the 
products of the dye decomposition still present relevant risks for the environment. Some authors studied 
the toxicity of untreated and peroxidase treated textile indust rial was tewater and report ed exciting 
outcomes. Ali et al. (2018)  report a reduction in genotoxicity after decolo urizing Reactive Blue 4 by a 
single -strand break in DNA analysis. Maria et al. (2007)  employed  horseradish peroxidase on the 
degradation of Remazol Turquoise Blue G , and Lanaset Blue 2R concluded that the treated wastewater 
presented a more negligible  toxicity effect on Daphnia magna . However , no change was detected towards 
Artemia salina.  
Baumer et al. (2018)  tested the viability of horseradish peroxidase on the degradation of Reactive Black 5 
(azo), Re active B lue 19 (anthraquinone), Reactive Red 239 (azo), and Reactive Blue 21 (phthalocyanine) . 
They  evaluated the toxicity of the treated wastewater by Daphnia magna, Euglena gracilisalgae , and Vibrio 
fischeri . The tests were conducted in batch mode, 125 m L of a d ye concentration of 50 mg.L-1 at 30 oC, and 
the decolo urization attained at 30 min were 87, 96, 17, and 90 %, accordingly. The toxicity outcomes 
showed a significantly higher advers e effect on the organisms in the test after enzymatic treatment. Th e 
author s attribute these results to the formation of decolo urization metabolites more toxic than the original 
dye molecule and suggest a next successive treatment step for wastewater cleaning. Table 3 presents several 
researchers who have reported the act ivity of  peroxidases from various  sources on the degradation of 
recalcitrant industrial dyes used in textile manufacturing.

2.10.3  Azoreductase  
Azoreductases are enzymes capable of catalyzing the cleavage reduction of azo groups ( -N=N -). These 
enzymes are produced by bacteria that degrade the azo dyes. As an oxidoreductase, this enzyme can be 
classified accordin g to its demand  of cofactors  in flavin -dependent and flavin -independent, and even further 
categorized as a function of the electron donor NADH or NA DPH (Verma et al. 2019) .  
The demand for coenzyme factors is the main drawback for the azoreductase applicati on in wastewater 
treatment. Thus, it is necessary to incorporate NAD(P)H recycling enzymes, such as glucose 
dehydrogenases and formate dehydrogenases (Dong et al. 2019) . Azoreductases also act on degrading dyes 
from the azo group, such as Remazol Blue (Karatay et al. 2015) , methyl orange (Verma et al. 2019) , and 
even aminoanthraquinone dyes suc h as Dispersive Blue (Elfarash et al. 2017) . In this sense, the importance 
of glucose 1 -dehydrogenase presence in an integrated system with azoreductase and the improv ement of 
this association on decomposing methyl red dye was reported by  Yang et al. (2013) . 
Regarding azoreductase immobilization,  silicas functionalized with amino and epoxy groups were applied 
to immobilize a novel azoreductase from Rhodococcus opacus . The enzymatic activity and storability 
increased significant ly compared  to the free enzyme (Qi et al. 2017) . The association of enzymes may 
promote further degradation due to the increase in degradation routes possibility. Guo et al. (2021)  
employed a bacterium consorti um to verify its ability to produce  enzymes to decolo urize saline water  
containing metanil yellow G, an azo dye used in paints. It reports that laccase, peroxidases, and 
azoreductase are responsible for the dye removal outcomes and the reduction of toxicit y associated with 
the proposed degradation pathway.  
The wide range of r eactions enzymes can catalyze expands their application and makes them suitable in 
several fields. In general, the studies presented here  show the feasibility of oxidoreductases on redu cing 
dyes with recalcitrant characteristics to compounds that can easil y be assimilated during conventional 11 
 biological treatment. Different approaches related to enzyme purification and immobilization have been 
tested worldwide to develop cost -effective sy stems. Nevertheless, further research is required to turn 
enzymatic sys tems into a viable treatment of real wastewaters.  
 
2.11 NEW TRENDS ON MICROBIAL AND ENZYME DEGRADATION OF DYE -
CONTAINING TEXTILE WASTEWATER TREATMENT  
Regarding wastewater treatments, there a re new approaches to traditional methods as dye adsorption and 
biofilms. In addition, there are emergent techniques as genetically modified organisms, combined treatment 
systems, membrane bioreactors, microbial fuel cells, support -based nanomaterials , and machine learning.  
 
2.11.1  Dye adsorption  
Adsorption is a well -known process for textile industry wastewater treatment, with activated carbon the 
most used adsorbent. Nevertheless, its high cost encourages  the research of low -cost alternative adsorbents 
(Pavithra et al. 2019; Gadekar and Ahammed 2020; Ravenni et al. 2020; Ahmad et al. 2020) . Activated 
sludge adsorbent is an exciting alternative and  can be synthesized by centrifugation, sludge carbonization , 
pyrolysis, ste am activation, H 2SO 4, and NaOH treatment (Pavithra et al. 2019) . 
Water treatment residuals in the dried form can also be applied as adsorbents on filtration column tests, as 
Gadekar and Ahammed (2020)  explored  for the decolo urization of real textile dye wastewater. The 
adsorption process promoted a maximum colo ur removal of 36%,  and the column operation obtained a 
decolo urization rate in the range of 60 –70%. Ravenni et al. (2020)  developed a  comparative study about 
the dye adsorption properties of waste chars from gasification of wood chips and pyrolysis of wastewater 
sludge with a commercial activated carbon. Sludge char perf ormed maximum adsorption capacities of 13.4 
and 8.4 mg.g-1 for the anionic and cationic dye, respectively. Steam activation improved these values to 
19.6 and 12.3 mg.g-1. However, the sludge -based adsorbent has not achieve d the efficiency of the 
commercial  activated carbon and wood char. The removal of methylene blue was studied using cow dung 
biochar (CDB), domestic sludge biochar (SB) subject to slow pyrolysis at 500 °C, and rice husk biochar 
(RHB) as adsorbents. The dye removal efficiencies by CDB, RHB , and SB in a batch experiment were 
97.0–99.0, 71.0–99.0, and 73.0 –98.9%, respectively (Ahmad et al. 2020) . The application of biomass 
adsorbent at an industrial scale presen ts some limitations such as the ac cessibility of adsorbents, adsorption 
sites, adsorbent stability, desorption rates at specific pH, and low adsorption, which should be improved to 
make this technology competitive (Li et al. 2019b; Zhou et al. 2019) .  
 
2.11.2  Genetically modified organisms (GMOs)  
The variations of textile effluent composition led to the development of some alternativ es to improve its 
remediation. Some molecular biology methodologies, such as cloning, directed evolution, gene 
recombination techniques, heterologous expression, metagenomics, random mutagenesis, rational design, 
and site -directed mutagenesis, are explored  to enhance the treatment of effluent s. The advances in genetic 12 
 engineering and molecular genetics enable virtual expression and clone of any gene in a suitable microbial 
host (Sen et al. 2016) .  
Laccase purified from Pleurotus  sp. MAK -II was tested to diazo dye, congo red, anthraquinone, and 
remazol brilliant blue R decolo urization. The enzyme presents high stability in  the presence of violuric acid 
redox mediator (Manavalan et al. 2015) . Liu et a l. (2015)  inserted the LacTT gene from Thermus  
thermophilus  SG0.5JP17 –16 into Pichia  pastoris , promoting a more effective aptitude to degrade congo 
red, reactive black, reactive black WNN , and remazol brilliant blue R. A thermo -alkali -stable laccase gene 
purified from Klebsiella  pneumoniae  was cloned into E. coli to be applied for the remediation of azo 
phloxine, bromophenol blue, congo red, cotton blue, malachite green, mordant black 9, reactive brilliant 
blue X -BR, reactive brilliant blue K -GR, reactive brilliant blue  KN-R, and reactive dark blue M -2GE from 
a textile industry wastewater (Liu et al. 2017) . Undoubtedly, the main benefit of GMOs is the potential to 
accelerate decolo urization efficiency. However, some disadvantages comprise cross -pollination and 
damaged environment due to horizontal gene transfer, reduced biodiversity , and uncertain long-term health 
effects (Kishor et al. 2021) . 
 
2.11.3  Combined treatments systems  
2.11.3.1  Bio-advanced oxidat ion process  
Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) combined with biological methods are known for their high 
efficiency for recalcitrant wastewater treatment and their promising application in industries. 
Biodegradation and photodegradation are  the best meth ods for rem oving the pollutants in water, besides 
enhancing  water pollutants. The application of biological processe s can be applied either as a pre -treatment 
or as a post -treatment (Oller et al. 2011) . Biological degradation as a first step acts on the biodegradable 
fraction of wastewate r by a low -priced and more eco -friendly method, demanding less energy and chemical 
inputs for further degradation of the remaining contaminants by chemical approaches (Paździor et al. 2019) , 
used onl y for the remediation of remained compounds resistant to biological oxidation (Ledakowicz et al. 
2017) . Thanavel et al. (2019)  applied a combined system of biolo gical and AOPs treatment to study the 
decolo urization of Remazol Red, Reactive Black 5 , and Reactive Red 180 by Aeromonas  hydrophila  SK16. 
The individual treatment was also analyzed , and a 72% decolo urization rate was reported. However, the 
combination of AOPs treatment with biological treatment proved to be more effective than single 
wastewater treatment by achieving 100%  decolo urization.  
Regarding non -biodegr adable-coloured compounds, chemical processes can assist or induce their 
biodegradability. Nevert heless, it is also possible that the by -products of dye degradation from chemical 
oxidation negatively interfere with the metabolic pathways of microorganisms (Dias et al. 2020) . In this 
context, the main objective of chemical pre -treatment is partial oxidat ion (Venkatesh et al. 2017) . 
Shanmugam et al. (2019)  explored the application of Fenton (H 2O2 & Fe2+) oxidation an d posterior 
biological treatment for the biodegradation of effluent with Acid Blue 113 azo dye. The AOP reduced the 
dye concentration by 40% , promoting  a maximum dye degradation of 85%, i.e., 45% by biodegradation. In 
this sense, Gott (2010)  recommended chemical oxidation as pre -treatment according to the BOD5/COD 
ratio below 0.2.  13 
 2.11.3.2  Membrane bioreactors  
Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) conjugate membrane filtration with a bi ological approach (Kurade  et al. 
2019) . MBR is a simple, cost -effective , and reliable method with solid potential to remove high nutrient 
load, organic chemicals , and colo uring pollutants (Rondon et al. 2015) .  
Membr anes effic iently separate the macro -molecules and microorganisms, but the major drawback is the 
membrane fouling in the bioreactor. Enhanced membrane bioreactor formed by two anoxic bioreactors, 
aerated bioreactor, UV -unit, and a granular activated carbon filter obt ained 95% of colo ur removal from a 
synthetic textile industry wastewater (Rondon et al. 2015) . Sepehri and Sarrafzadeh (2018)  tested and 
proved the efficiency of a nitrifying -enriched activated sludge to  decrease membrane fouling in MBR. An 
enhancement of 2.5 times in the permeation performance was achieved with the nitrifiers community 
compar ed to the conventional activated sludge process, which, consequently, improved MBR yields 
production; compact natu re; high d egradation rate inorganic pollutants, nutrient removal, quality of treated 
effluent; lower sludge generation; reliability; and small footprint, when compared to conventional activated 
sludge process, are some of the advantages of MBR. Nevertheles s, some di sadvantages alert the 
requirement of more study and process improvements, such as aeration limitations, stress on sludge in 
external MBR, membrane fouling , and higher operation cost (Rondon et al . 2015) . 
 
2.11.3.3  Microbial fuel cells  
Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are a bio -electrochemical treatment system composed of various 
microorganisms used as catalysts to oxidize inorganic and organic compounds and  generat e electrons (Yuan 
et al. 2019; Sayed et al. 2020) . Sulphate -reducing consortium in MFC anodic chamber was used for 
simultaneous dye degradation, e lectricity  generation, and sulfate reduction, in which the dye removal yield 
achieved ≤ 85%. At stable operating conditions, the power generation of 258 ± 10 mW.m-2 was achieved  
(Miran et al. 2018) . 
Yang et al. (2019)  used bio -electrochemical systems to decrease the concentration of Reactive Black 5 
(RB5) from 0.503 mM to 0.124 mM. The effect of circuit conne ction was investigated for the azo dye 
degradation and bioelectricity generation. Compared to the open circuit system, the closed -circuit system 
exhibited higher decolo urization efficiency (96% of Acid Red 18, 67% of Acid Orange 7, and 60% of 
Congo Red) . The voltage outputs were ranked in t he decreasing order of AR18 > AO7 > CR. This method 
represents an advance d, fast treatment efficiency, novel, and sustainable approach for the efficient treatment 
of industrial wastewaters and the power generation with reduced CO 2 emissions . However, the h igh 
treatment cost and sludge generation are associated disadvantages  (Oon et al. 2020) .  
 
2.11.3.4  Support -based nanomaterials  
According to several pilot -scale, laboratory, and in situ water treatment studies, nanomaterials have been 
explored as a promising alter native . These materials drew attention since they have a wide range of 
applications as remediation, drinking,  and wastewater treatment. Nanomaterials have remarkable properties 
due to their smal l size and consequent unique physicochemical effects, includin g increased adsorption 14 
 yields and photocatalysis reactivity (Dasgupta et al. 2017; Bouabidi et al. 2019) . Suganya and Revathi 
(2016)  immobilized P. putida  and B. licheni formis  on sodium alginate and polyacrylamide gel beads to 
explore the decolo urization potential. According to the results, the sodium alginate support provided better 
conditions for the process when compared to polyacrylamide gel beads and free cells proce sses. 
 
2.11.3.5  Biofilms  
Biofilms are negatively charged layers of micr obial conglomerations of one or more species trapped to 
abiotic or biotic surfaces by incorporation in the matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) 
(Mohapatra et al. 2020) . Compar ed to free bacterial usage, bacterial biofilms have some advantages, such 
as the ability to exchange nutrient and gen etic materials, bigger tolerance to toxic compounds and differ ent 
metabolic states, protection from the effects of environmental changes (Mohapatra et al. 2020) . The dye 
adsor ption mechanism by biofilms outcomes from two stages: the first is the dye molecules transport 
through the solution to the surface of the biofilm, followed by the adsorption of dye molecules to the active 
sites of biofilm (Sun et al. 2016) . Moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) is one of the most explored 
bioreactors and unites the benefits of activated sludg e and biofilm (Paździor et al. 2019) . Due to the 
promotion of biomass growth on a moving s upport, some advantages can be observed , such as the absence 
of obstruction problems, decrease in hydraulic retention time, easier separation among liquid and solid 
phases, flexibility in operat ion, increase in biomass weight, less space only and environme ntal effects, low 
sludge production, superior biomass residence time, and superior capability to degrade complex compounds 
(Castro et al. 2020) . MBBR may work in anaero bic or aerobic conditions and have been effectively used in 
dye decolo urization and degradation studies with great yields of decolo urization (Castro et al. 2020 ; Deng 
et al. 2020; Ong et al. 2020) .  
 
2.11.3.6  Dye industry waste and resource recovery strategy  
With the proposal to reduce the amount of waste discharged from industries, its use in the resource recovery 
process as input material for recovering value -added products is being widely explored. Mishra et al. (2020)  
have performed the decolo urization of mixed dyes reactive red 21 (RR21) and reactive orange 16 (RO16). 
The authors obtained 83% of col our removal  using  a microbial fuel cell from dye wastewater with 
bioenergy generation of 940.61 ± 5 mW.m-2 power density with 790 ± 5 mV voltage output generation. A 
single -chamber microbial fuel cell with microalgal biocathodes (with 42% of the cathode su rface covered 
by microalgal naturals) was designed for the simultaneous biodegradation of real dye textile wastewater 
and the generation of bioelectricity. It was observed that the atmospheric and diffused CO 2 promoted good 
algal growth rates  and immobiliz ation, indicating its operation at air -exposed conditions. The maximum 
volumetric power density achieved was 123.2 ± 27.5 mW.m-3 highlighting it as a promising alternative to 
a Pt cathode (Logroño et al. 2017) . Phytoremediation technology by microalgal strains viz. Anabaena 
ambigua , Chlorella pyrenoidosa , and Scenedesmus abundans  using textile wastewater as a nutrient source 
were studied to generate electricity. The authors correlat ed the differences of various UV -Vis in the spectra 
obtained with the breakdown and formation of compounds and postulated the biodegradation for 15 
 wastewater remediation. Electrical conductivity and redox potential reduced to 2.0 mS and 157.86 ± 1.89 
mV, res pectively (Brar et al. 2019) .  
 
2.11.3.7  Machine learning  
Due to their sensibility to environmental changes, algal systems in complex bioprocesses application s are 
not precisely controlled. Therefore, machine learning algorithms (MLAs) and dynamic mod els, control 
systems and real -time monitoring  are a solution to preserve optimum conditions. Their application brought 
some exciting results for the optimizing study of algal system performance, which provides a better 
understanding of the biological proce sses when compared to the conventional kinetic or phenomenological 
models (Iratni and Chang 2019) .  
MLAs application leads to effective real -time monitoring, defect detection, optimization, and anticipation 
of uncertainties of complex environmental systems. Besides, disruptions or failures from leaking pipelines, 
malfunctioning of bioreactors, unexpected flow rate variations , organic loadings, and temperature are also 
situations that can be efficiently anticipa ted by integrating these algorithms with online sensors. 
Notwithstanding the MLAs application benefits, it is essential  to consider that to implement these advanced 
models, sensors, data acquisition, transmission , and storage, have to promote knowledge at decision making 
to optimize their system performance. Increments could be performed by implementing  multi -parameter 
sensors and the internet of things (IoT) for full -scale WWTPs , which give plant managers support to identify 
equipment faults, improve energy  usage, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions (Sundui et al. 2021) . 
 
2.12 CONCLUSION S 
Regarding dye -containing textile wa stewaters, they are often pumped into freshwater bodies or sea without 
using a treatment system, in particular developing countries. In this sense, biological processes are efficient 
and eco -friendly, operate at mild, among others. Anaerobic/aerobic sequen tial systems are highly efficient 
on azo dye Red2 -degradation. In addition, phy coremediation, and GMO oxidoreductases producers, 
particularly  azoreductases, laccases, and peroxidases , are promising alternatives. Despite the problematic  
operating control, t he integrated systems as AOPs -Aeromonas  hydrophila  or MBRs (anoxic bioreactors,  
aerated bioreactor, UV -unit, and granular activated carbon filter) have remarkable potential to remove such 
high nutrient load, organic chemicals, and dyes. Finally, microbial fuel cells can be associated with 
wastewater treatments.

Abstract  
The effluent from the textile industry is a complex mixture of recalcitrant molecules that  can harm the 
environment and human health. Biological treatments are usually applied for this wastewater, part icularly 
activated sludge, due to its high efficiency, and low implementation and operation costs. However, the 
activated sludge microbiome is ra rely well -known. In general, activated sludges are composed of 
Acidobacteria , Bacillus , Clostridium , Pseudomonas , Proteobacteria , and Streptococcus , in which Bacillus  
and Pseudomonas  are highlighted for bacterial dye degradation. Consequently, the process is not carried 
out under optimum conditions (treatment yield). Therefore, this review aims to context ualize the potential 
environmental impacts of azo dye -containing wastewater from the textile industry, including toxicity, 
activated sludge microbiome iden tification, in particular using the matrix -assisted laser 
desorption/ionization time -of-flight mass s pectrometry (MALDI -TOF MS) as a novel, rapid and accurate 
strategy for the identification of activated sludge microbiome (potential to enhance treatment yi eld).

3.1 INTRODUCTION  
The high fluctuations in composition and other parameters such as biological oxygen demand (BOD), 
chemical oxygen demand (COD), colour, pH, and salini ty during textile processing contribute to the 
complexity of textile wastewater treatment (Se nthilkumar et al. 2011 ; Farias et al. 2017 ). The textile 
industry generates, inherently, a high volum e of toxic effluent, mainly due to the chemical baths and rinsing 
series (Harane and Adivarek ar 2017 ). According to Leão ( 2002 ), 150 L of water are necessary to produce 
1 kg of fabric, in which 132 L (88%) are wastewaters.   
The dyeing stage leads to a large amount of wastewater with high levels of COD (from the chemical used 
in the process), BOD (due to the direct discharge of wastewater in water sources which promotes a rapid 
depletion of dis - solved oxygen), pH, and dyes (H olkar et al. 2016 ; Swati and Faruqui 2018 ). The incorrect 
disposal of textile industry effluents into water bodies interferes with the penetration of light. Hence, it 
harms the photosynthetic ac tivity of water body communities (Elisangela et al. 2009 ). Thus, the textile 
industry effluent has to be properly treated before disposal into water bodies. In this sense, conventional 
textile in dustry treatments include coag ulation/flocculation, biological, membrane, and advanced oxidation 
processes (Vajnhandl and Valh 2014 ; Yukseler et al. 2017 ). Among these techniques, the dye 
biode gradation by the activated slu dge process is drawing attention due to its low cost (implementation and 34 
 operation) and high efficiency (Haddad et al. 2018 ). Regarding activated sludge, the effectiveness of COD 
and BOD reductio n can reach up to 90% (Pereira  et al. 2010 ; Waghmode et al. 2019 ). 
Activated sludges are composed of microbial communities. However, there are few reports on their 
characterization (El et al. 2016; Zhu et al. 2018 ; Cao et al. 2019 ). The evaluation of activated sludges as 
microbial consortia is essential to comprehend the interactions among the microbial com- munity and 
optimize biode gradation (Köchling et al. 2017 ). Nevertheless, experiments of dye -biodegradation by 
isolated strains from activated sludges makes easier the elucidation of biodegradation mechanisms (Khehra 
et al. 2005 ). 
Therefore, this review describes the main biodegradation aspects of textile effluent. Then, it correlates the 
MALDI -TOF MS as a promising methodology for identifying activated sludge microbiome and, 
consequently, im proving the treatment yield.  
 
3.2 POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF AZO DYES  
Azo dyes are chemically composed of aromatic groups and azo chromophore ( -N=N -). They are highly 
water -soluble. It is worth noting that azo dyes are widely applied by textile industry correspondin g ≥ 50% 
out of the worldwide d ye production (Brüschweiler and Merlot 2017). However, they hamper conventional 
textile wastewater treatment plants due to their recalcitrance.  
It is usually observed a very low degradation rate of azo dyes at primary and seco ndary treatment stages 
due to their recalcitrant behaviour, which is related to their synthetic origin and chemical structure, 
providing them high resistance to photo -oxidation, biological activity, and other environmental conditions. 
The molecular arrange ment and size of these substan ces contribute negatively to their biodegradation since 
a steric effect hinders the enzymatic access necessary to start the degradation (Rittmann 2018). Therefore, 
the accumulation of azo dyes can occur in sediments, soils, an d contaminate the drinking wat er supply 
system (Salter -Blanc et al. 2016; Xiang et al. 2016; Mullai et al. 2017). The colour reduction ≈ 50% (azo 
dyes) from coloured wastewater is considered adequate. However, the toxicity factor must also be 
considered, p articularly due to the aromati c amines (Xiang et al. 2016; Brüschweiler and Merlot 2017). 
Heavy metals, salts, and sulfides are potentially microbial inhibitors of biological treatment system. Thus, 
it must be also evalu - ated (Sarayu and Sandhya 2012).  
It is known that the chromophore  azo groups present in anionic and nonionic dyes suffer reductive cleavage 
producing highly toxic aromatic amines (Table 4): R-N = N -R′ + 4ē + 4H+ → R -NH2 + R′ -NH2 (Xiang et 
al. 2016). The chemically reduced form of dyes was a lready found in sediments of a quatic bodies. These 
molecules are carcinogenic, since they can be oxidized to N -hydroxylamines. Thus, the nitrenium ion 
generated can bind with cellular macromolecules as DNA, proteins, and RNA (Ford and Griffin 1992; Sari 
and Simarani 2019). Nevertheless , an activating metabolism varies according to the balance between 
numerous competing steps, the bioavailability of the reactive metabolite, and nutritional habits. Moreover, 
possible differences in individual susceptibility i nfluence the higher complexity  of the metabolic pathway, 
polymorphisms of enzymes associated with the metabolism of aromatic amines, and equilibrium between 
activating and inactivating steps (Gregory 2007; Neumann 2010).  
Kumar et al. (2019) carried out the  optimal process of decolouriz ation of Acid Black 24 azo dye by Bacillus  
pseudomycoides . The authors also evaluated the genotoxicity and phytotoxicity of the degraded dye. 35 
 Genotoxicity assay was carried out using Allium cepa (onion), evaluating the DNA dam age in cells treated 
with dye solution performed by single -cell gel electrophoresis method. The results were obtained by 
comparing before and after decolourization. The untreated dye sample presented a genotoxic effect on the 
root cells of Allium  cepa . Phy totoxicity experiments were al so performed on seeds of Vigna  radiata  and 
Sorghum vulgare  at 25 °C. After 48 h was observed the number of full seeds germinated, and with five 
days of incubation was calculate the length of plumule (cm) and radicle of seedlin gs (cm) and germination 
percen tage. The control and treated sample results presented similar values, which indicate the production 
of non -toxic metabolites correlated to high degradation yields.  
On the other hand, according to Waghmode et al. (2019) higher  phytotoxicity was observed wi th Phaseolus 
mungo and Sorghum vulgare after a sequential photocatalytic and biological treatment consisting of ZnO 
as the photocatalyst and a microbial consortium of Brevibaccilus laterosporus  and Galactomyces 
geotrichum . Thr ough HR -MS and GC –MS analysis,  degradation products were analyzed after bacterial 
treatment. Many products with a fragmentation pattern inferring asymmetrical/symmetrical cleavage in azo 
bonds were found, probably due to the demethylation and desulfonation  mechanisms. It was also obser ved 
that the produced metabolites in the activated sludge can be correlated to microbial species (Tabasum et al. 
2019).  
The toxicity of a treated textile effluent was analyzed by Carvalho et al. (2020), using Vibrio fischeri  as a 
toxicity indicator, monitoring cell luminescence inhibition (30 min). The dilution factor (effluent) required 
to not affect bacteria metabolism was also used as a comparison parameter, in which the acute toxicity is 
correlated to 50% reduction in the  bacteria bioluminescence. In the conventional up -flow anaerobic sludge 
blanket (UASB) effluent, it was obtained a dilution factor between 14 and 16, which can be associated with 
the presence of aromatic amines, (strong toxicity levels). Whereas the result s of UASB effluent micro 
aerated on top indicated that aromatic amines were converted into nontoxic compounds.  
Aromatic amines from the azo -dye degradation have mutagenic effects in Salmonella  and Mammalian . 
Methyl Red, which is naturally mutagenic, has al ready been associated with N,N -
dimethylphenylenediamine (DMPD) formation, a toxic and mutagenic aromatic amine (Wong and Yu 
1999). Consequently, methodical optimization studies simultaneously with metabolite toxicity testing 
should be implemented for each system, considering dye, microbe, enzyme, or mediator (Sen et al. 2016).  
Daily large amounts of residual water containing a high concentration of azo dyes, between 100 and 250 
mg L−1, are incorrectly discharged into water bodies (Garcia -Segura and Brillas 2016). To mitigate the 
impact of azo dyes (colour), their chemical bonds must be broken within the chromophores group structures 
(Ghosh et al. 2017). Aerobic biodegradation of dyes  through the activated sludge process is recognized as 
an economical and eff icient technology. Nevertheless, some drawbacks can cause serious environmental 
impact, in particular, due to the large amounts of sludge that are inherently generated (Lv et al. 2 013). In 
addition, most dyes and chemicals from the textile process have a l ow rate of biodegradability. 
Deraniyagala (2017) reported that the treatment of textile industrial wastewater by activated sludge 
produces 2000 tons of dangerous sludge, considerin g a daily flow rate of 4000 m3 of wastewater. Thus, the 
activated sludge tre atment should be improved, constantly. Regarding biodegradation investigations of  36

 textile effluents, usually they are outlined to enhance the activated sludge microbiome degradation, 
biosorption (sequestration of dyes from solution by che lation, complexation, precipitation, or ionic  
interactions), and mineralization (complete oxidation of dyes to H 2O, CO 2, and other inorganic com - 
pounds) by varying physicochemical parameters such as pH, temperature, carbon and nitrogen sources, dye 
concen tration, inoculum size, among others (Chen et  al. 2003; Moosvi et al. 2005; Kapdan and Erten 2007; 
Pandey et al. 2007; Khalid et al. 2008; Dhanve et al. 2008; Mullai et al. 2017). However, there are new 
technologies as MALDI -TOF MS that can assist to reach  higher treatment yields.  
 
3.3 DYE ADSORPTION PRO CESS AND TEXTILE SLUDGE  
Adsorption is a wide used wastewater treatment technology, also applied to the textile industry (Ho and 
McKay 2003; Jain et al. 2003). Intermolecular attraction forces between adsorbate a nd adsorbent lead to 
mass transfer, in which the accumulation of contaminants occurs at the interface between phases: gas –
liquid, gas –solid, liquid –liquid, or liquid –solid interface (Reisch 1996; Dąbrowski 2001). In this sense, the 
molecular structure of t he adsorbent, medium pH, solute solubility, a nd temperature significantly affect the 
adsorption process (Foust et al. 1980).  
Regarding adsorption of dyes, there are four main steps: (i) the dye movement from the crude solution to 
the liquid film or the int erface of the adsorbent solid; (ii) its diffu sion through the liquid film to the external 
sites of adsorption; (iii) its inner diffusion through the adsorbent solid pores or capillaries, and; (iv) its 
adsorption at the available places of the capillary sur faces or walls (Reynolds and Richards 1996).  
The most usually used adsorbent for textile wastewater treatment and colour removal is the activated 
carbon. However, its high cost is promoting the development of low -cost alternative adsorbents (Aksu 
2001; Cal vo 2001; Wang and Hu 2007; Ju et al. 2008; Sm ith et al. 2009; Rafatullah et al. 2010). In this 
sense, waste materials, such as activated sludge, are an interesting alternative since large quantities of 
sludge are inherently produced (Smith et al. 2009).  
The sludge -based adsorbent can be produced by t he carbonization of sludge, centrifugation, H 2SO 4 
treatment, NaOH treatment, pyrolysis, steam activation. It is worth noting that microbial membranes of 
sludge affect the adsorbent properties since microbial mem branes are negatively charged surfaces (Pavit hra 
et al. 2019). Thus, the control mechanisms of dye adsorption include chelation, complexation, ion exchange, 
and surface adsorption (Crini 2006; Wang and Hu 2007; Sadhasivam et al. 2007).  
The decolourization efficiency of an alternative adsorbent from t extile effluent sludge was tested by 
Vasques et al. (2011) on Reactive Orange 16 (RO16), Reactive Red 2 (RR2), and Reactive Red 141 
(RR141) dyes. The absorbent was submitted to a thermal activation at 500 °C fol lowed by the chemical 
activation with acetic acid. At 25 ºC – equilibrium - it was observed the complete removal of RO16 and 
RR2. Regarding RR141 and RO16, the adsorption capacity was enhanced with NaCl and Na 2SO 4, 
respectively.  
Sludge from the textile ind ustry was also used as a low - cost adsorbent for Reactive Red 2 dye. A sequential 
thermal (500 °C for 70 min) and chemical (H 2SO 4, 25 °C for 3 h) treatment were evaluated. The kinetic 
experiments, the pseudo -second -order model, were performed in batch mode . The adsorption isotherm 
model was evaluated under different temperature and pH conditions. Maximum adsorption 213.9 mg.g−1 
was obtained with pH 2 and 25 °C (Sonai et al. 2016).  39 
 Autoclaved bio -sludge was tested for disperse dye adsorption in sequencing ba tch reactor (SBR) systems 
with and w ithout granular activated carbon (GAC –SBR) using textile wastewater (TWW) collected from a 
central wastewater treatment plant in a textile factory in Thailand; and synthetic textile wastewater 
(STWW). The GAC –SBR system presented more effectiveness compare d with SBR in treating TWW, 
resulting in a dye decolourization rate of 93.0 ± 1.1%, under the organic loading of 0.18 kg BOD5.m−3 
(Sirianuntapiboon and Srisornsak 2007).  
Haddad et al. (2018) highlighted the optimization of aerobic biodegradation efficiency to reduce the 
residual adsorbed dye in the final waste sludge. Laboratory and pilot -scale investigations were carried out. 
The process at pilot -scale was tested under different hydraulic retention times (HRT) of 2 –5 days and sludg e 
recycling rates (SRR) of 220 –680 m3.day−1, which achieved the optimal result at HRT of 5 days and a SRR 
of 0.22 with dye biodegradation efficiency of 5%. These best conditions applied at full -scale reduced the 
amount of the discharged dyes (89%) signific antly.  
Water treatment residuals (WTR) in the dried form were used as adsorbents in filtration column tests for 
the colour removal from a real textile d ye wastewater. The process presented a maximum colour removal 
of 36% in the adsorption process and a dec olourization rate in the range of 60 –70% in column operation, 
which generally shows a greater removal. The authors defended the use of WTR as a primary treatment for 
textile wastewater decolourization (Gadekar and Ahammed 2020).  
There are some limitations to applying biomass at an industrial scale, including the accessibility of 
adsorbents, adsorption sites, adsorbent stability, low adsorption, and desorp tion rates at specific pH and 
other environmental factors such as ions and salts. These factors should b e improved to make this 
technology competitive (Li et al. 2019a; Zhou et al. 2019). Regarding emerging advanced technologies 
used for dye adsorption, th e most promising are: magnetic nanoparticles; metal/nonmetal -doped 
nanostructures; ceramic and modified nanoclays; and carbonaceous nano -materials such as single and 
multiwalled carbon nanotubes, carbon quantum dots, and expanded graphite and graphene nano sheets 
(Fraga et al. 2021). These technologies also present an environmental clean -up perspective and ha ve been 
attempted to achieve high rates of colour removal efficiency and low cost (implementation and operation) 
(Anand et al. 2020; Nayak et al. 2020).  
Therefore, regarding the dye biodegradation by bacteria culture, the biological adsorption phenomenon 
interferes on decolourization results, making it difficult to understand biological degradation in details, 
since adsorption occurs at the same time (Gho sh et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2020). In this sense, Kiayi et al. 
(2019) investigated this factor through a  biosorption test, based on spectrophotometric visualization of the 
solution from the suspension of bacterial pellets in methanol and water. However, no  adsorption 
interference was detected. Corso and Maganha De Almeida (2009) evaluated the adsorption cont ribution 
using different concentrations of isolated biomass (autoclaved and non -autoclaved) to inoculate on dye 
solution. After 120 h, it was measured a bsorbances of the supernatants, which revealed high levels of 
decolourization index. The identification of adsorption in biodecolourization processes was also pointed by 
Asad et al. (2007) through the gradual decrease of adsorption peaks identified in a de colourization. Besides 
this verification, the authors made an association between live and inactivated c ells, inferring that 
inactivated cells cannot decolourize an aqueous system by the adsorption process.  40 
 The adsorption process is possible due to the cel l sur - face composition from active functional groups 
(amine, carboxyl, hydroxyl, phosphate, and sulfhyd ryl) for dye binding (Kapoor et al. 1999; Corso and 
Maganha De Almeida 2009). Nevertheless, it also depends on the concentration of dye (Ghosh et al. 20 17). 
The presence of these functional groups on the cellular wall provides a negative charge that attrac ts 
positively charged molecules as cationic azo dyes or with positively charged groups (e.g. basic red 29, and 
basic blue 41) (Srivastava and Thakur 200 6; Congeevaram et al. 2007). Therefore, the adsorption must be 
considered, carefully, in biological trea tments.  
 
3.4 ACTIVATED SLUDGE MICROBIOME  
Activated sludge is an association among many organisms in a community, mostly composed of aerobic 
and anaerobic ba cteria. Some bacterial species can flocculate, which favours sedimentation (Paździor et al. 
2019). In ad dition, they can reach high rates of decolourization and mineralization, which leads to low toxic 
sludge generation and a cost -effective process. Specie s belonging to the genera Aeromonas , Bacillus , 
Proteus , and Pseudomonas  are some of the widely investiga ted bacteria for dye degradation (Mullai et al. 
2017).  
The azo dyes biodegradation by bacteria generally requires a combination of two stages. First, an  anaerobic 
step responsible for discolouration when azo bonds are broken in the presence of redox mediat ors through 
the azo reductase enzyme (Klepacz -Smółka et al. 2010). Then, an aerobic phase promotes the efficient 
removal of organic compounds. Since the  decolourization by pure cultures is associated with the 
development of aromatic amines (toxic compounds ), mixed cultures (Table 4) are often used due to their 
synergistic metabolisms. This synergy promotes the conversion of toxic intermediates into nontoxic by -
products (Yang et al. 2012; Patel 2013; Lotito et al. 2014; Manekar et al. 2014; Ali et al. 2016; Mullai et 
al. 2017).  
Carvalho et al. (2020) evaluated two up -flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors R1 and R2 (with 
aeration in the upper part), as a comparative system to remove tetra -azo dye Direct Black 22 (DB22). The 
discolouration and COD remov al efficiencies for both reactors were similar (67 e 72% for R1 and 59 e 78% 
for R2), pointing to no consider - able influence of oxygen in R2. DNA extraction (Power Kit Soil® —MO 
Bio laboratories, Carlsbad -CA, USA), quantification (NanoDrop2000 spectrophoto meter —Thermo Sci - 
entific, USA), storage at − 20 °C, and Illumina MiSeq with the universal primer 515 F paired with 907R 
for Archaea and Bacteria domains, with 20,000 reads and 2 × 300 bp. Microbiome identification of the 
sludge bed of both reactors was ca rried out (sequencing), which were similar to each other, that is, 
Methanosaeta , Syntrophus , and Trichococcus  genera. Sequences with less than 150 bp and ambiguous base 
calls were not considered, and the Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were defined by c lustering at 97% 
similarity. The authors proved that higher salinity in some zones of the reactors promoted some alterations 
on the microbial community and the association between putative genera Brevundimonas  and Ornatilinea  
and aromatic amine microaerobi c removal. An investigation of the metagenomic of activated sludge from 
the common effluent plant of Chennai (India), used in the textile effluent treatment process with mixed azo 
dyes, was conducted by (Krishnaswamy et al. 2020). The nanopore sequencing w as carried out with PCR 
amplification  and barcoding of the sample from the acclimatized sludge used to treat synthetic textile 
wastewater treatment. After the obtaining and purification of the activated sludge sample, it was amplified 41 
 with PCR and barcode d. Then, adapters were connected to the amplified fragments constructed a library, 
which was sequenced using nanopore sequences. The fragments of 16 s rRNA genes were computed, and 
in the diversity of the organisms was found Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria (abundantly), and Terrabacteria. 
The Proteobacteria phylum were represented by the Acidithiobacilia , Burkholderiales , Betaproteobacteria , 
Neiseriales , Nitrosomonadales , and Rhodocyclales  genera.  
Cao et al. (2019) isolated and developed an indigenous bacter ia consortium from a sludge sample of a dying 
factory for characterizing the active functional microbial communities involved in the degradation of a 
sulfonated azo dye, Direct Blue 2B (DB2), in a simple batch reactor. The decolourization potential of 
isolated and combined cultures was analyzed under different temperatures, pHs, dye, and NaCl 
concentrations, operation modes (static, and agitated). The study obtained 90.74% of maximum 
decolourization of 100 mg.L−1 DB2 at 48 h, static condition, with 38.7 °C of culture temperature; initial pH 
was 7.57, and initial NaCl concentration was 20.10 g.L−1 predicted by the quadratic model.  
To identify the main microorganisms from activated sludge responsible for the degra dation of Congo red 
(CR) and Amino Black (AB) d yes, Zhu et al. (2018) proposed a combined model. Besides identifying the 
species directly involved in azo dye degradation, the study aimed to reveal the relationship between azo 
dye degradation and microorgan isms through DNA extraction, polymerase chain r eaction (PCR), and 
Illumina Sequencing Analysis, with a multiple linear regression model. The reactions of transformation in 
each of the six reactor compartments were investigated, and it was verified that deg radation intermediates 
present in each compartm ent were affecting the microbial communities differently. Concerning the 
functional species and decolourization process, Bacteroides  and Lactococcus  exhibited significant 
correlations with the azo bond with th e t-value of the corresponding regression coeff icient larger than 2.0. 
The study highlighted the occurrence of the decolourization process by anaerobic condition and 
mineralization under an aerobic environment. The microbial community was significantly aff ected by the 
structures of azo dyes and, conseq uently, their intermediates.  
Zhang et al. (2018) investigated activated sludge samples from three typical Chinese municipal wastewater 
treatment plants: domestic sewage, fine chemical industry, and textile dye ing wastewater. Microbial DNA 
was extracted by the liquid -nitrogen grinding pretreatment method; metagenomic sequencing and 
bioinformatic analysis were executed to understand their metabolic potentials. The dominant phyla in every 
sample included Proteobac teria (12.3 –58.5%), Acidobacteria (1.8 –35.1%), Chloroflexi (2.8 –37.7%). 
However, were also found in all samples Bacteroidia (0.7 –19.2%), Actinobacteria (0.7 –6.8%), TM7 (0.1 –
5.2%), Synergistetes (0.02 –5.6%) and Thermi (0.03 –7.89%). In the textile dyeing ind ustry wastewater, 
Nitrospirae (48.68%) and Acid obacteria (34.82%) were prevailing in the oxidation ditch.  
A synergic effect of activated sludge treatment and partial Fenton’s oxidation for decolourization of azo 
dye Reactive Violet 5 (RV5) was observed. Pr etreatment with Fenton’s reagent in 500 mg.L−1 RV5 aqueous 
solutions promoted 52.9, 83.9, and 91.3% of colour removal within 60 min to H2O2 concentrations of 1.0, 
1.5, and 2.0 mM, respectively. Then biological treatment removed 70.2%, on average, of the re sidual RV5 
concentration. An activated sludge m icrobial community analysis was realized through Genomic DNA 
using the Power Soil DNA isolation kit (MoBio Laboratories Inc., Solana Beach, CA, USA). Several of the 
most abundant bacteria were Acidithiobacillu s, Acidocella , and Streptococcus , that presente d azo dye 
reducing abilities. The study also revealed that exposure to RV5 modified a highly -specialized community 42 
 with degrading activity to azo dye, including Aspergillus , Clostridium , and Trichosporon  speci es 
(Meerbergen et al. 2017).  
Thus, the wide variety of activated sludge microbiomes mentioned above is directly associated with the 
complexity of each textile effluent, the structures of the azo dyes, their intermediates, and treatment 
conditions. However,  the microbial community affe cts directly the decolourisation yield. Thus, it should 
be investigated deeply.  
 
3.5 SCREENING OF BACTERIA FROM ACTIVATED SLUDGE; RAPID IDENTIFICATION BY 
MALDI‑TOF  
Usually, microbial identification is carried out using multiple experiments and analytical proce dures, for 
instance, extraction, purification, separation (e.g. through 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA gene sequencing), 
complex phenotypic, molecular, and morphological characteristics. These methods are costly and often do 
not provide information on microbial phy siology (Padliya and Wood 2004; Kemptner et al. 2009; Kim et 
al. 2010; Singhal et  al. 2015).  
In this sense, matrix -assisted laser desorption/ionization time -of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI -TOF 
MS) is a technique for a wide range of chemical identificati on. It can also be used for rapid microbial 
identification (protein pattern overl ay) (Murugaiyan et al. 2012). Generally speaking, a reference library 
(e.g. MALDI Biotyper) composed of proteomic signals (spectrum) of known microorganisms is used. The 
spect rum of an unknown sample is instantly matched against the reference library to id entify 
microorganisms by their molecular fingerprint. Its comprehensive database of pathogenic microorganisms, 
rapid process, relatively higher accuracy, sensitivity, and econ omy in terms of labour and costs involved 
lead to advances over other microbial i dentification methods prevalent in clinical diagnosis. To date, there 
are some limits to the applicability of MALDI -TOF MS in the area of microbial ecology research due to 
the deficiency of data on non -clinical microorganisms. In other words, the reference  library should be 
expanded to all microbial species as soon as possible (Singhal et al. 2015; Rahi et al. 2016).  
Nevertheless, this technique is becoming increasingly fundame ntal for microbial characterization and 
identification, describing new species du e to its ability to distinguish at the species level (Lang et al. 2015; 
Patil et al. 2015; Tong et al. 2015). MALDI -TOF MS technique was already used in a wide range of 
applic ation, for instance, to distinguish bacterial species of the Rhizobiaceae  family (Ferreira et al. 2011), 
to identify bacterial species from the human gut (Lagier et al. 2012), to detect pathogenic bacteria (food 
security assessment) (Bier et al. 2017; Fröh ling et al. 2018), to make faster the urinary tract infection 
identification (Li et al. 2019b), to identify marine bacterial symbionts (Dieckmann et al. 2005; Vidal et al. 
2020).  
In the context of the textile industry, the MALDI -TOF MS analysis was already  used to obtain mass spectra 
of bacterial proteins from cotton cloth samples cont aminated with Shigella flexneri , Escherichia coli , and 
Aeromonas hydrophila , which are species that could cause illness through the faecal -oral routes. The 
authors confirmed t he technique as a rapid method with a high potential for detecting biomarker prot eins 
recovered directly from clothing samples (Holland et al. 2000).  
A Bacillus  sp. isolated from sediments of distillery unit was found to overproduce laccase with enormous 
potential for decolourization of various recalcitrant dyes. The enzyme peptide seq uences were obtained 43 
 with MALDI –TOF MS, the spectra were analyzed using MASCOT software (Matrix Science) and 
compared with the NCBI database for placement of enzyme with known  sequences. About decolourization 
tests, after enzymatic action, there was around  73% decolourization of dye (trypan blue) and 62% of BBR 
along with the precipitation of dye contents (Kaushik and Thakur 2013). A study developed by Afreen et 
al. (2017) show ed the use of MALDI -TOF MS to bacterial enzyme identification by peptide mass 
fingerprinting. The enzyme was obtained from Spirulina  platensis  CFTRI, purified, and used in the 
decolourization of anthraquinone dye Reactive blue 4 (96%) within 4 h.  
In this c ontext, MALDI -TOF MS analysis could bring promising results when used to identify  activated 
sludge microbiome. As subtly explored by Mulinari et al. (2020), who used MALDI -TOF MS analysis for 
species identification of activated sludge, which showed the pre sence of both types of microorganisms: 
aerobics (e.g. Lysinibaciullus  fusiformis ) and facultative anaerobic (e.g. Escherichia coli  and Kosakonia 
cowanii ). The MALDI -TOF MS -based biotyping is a remarkable resource. Due to the speed, accuracy, and 
sensitivit y, the wastewater treatment plant can operate with fine adjustments to enhance th e biodegradation, 
for instance, correlates specific dyes with microbial changes. In addition, the MALDI -TOF MS data can be 
used for more drastic changes, for example, after mi crobial isolation and identification, the best azo -
degrading species could be imm obilized and then added into the treatment plant, or it could be growth (ex -
situ), then periodically inoculated into the treatment plant.  
 
3.6 STATE‑OF‑THE‑ART AND PERSPECTIVES  
The textile industry produces large volumes of recalcitrant effluents, including azo dyes that negatively 
affect water bodies and their biological activity. The biodegradation of textile industry effluent, in particular 
azo dyes, by activated sludge stands o ut due to its high yields of decolourization. The genera Pseudomonas , 
Bacillus , Proteobacteria , Clostridium , Acidobacteria , and Streptococcus  are usually found in activated 
sludges. However, there are unknown microbial s pecies that should be investigated, besides the seasonality 
and complexity of textile wastewater composition change activated sludge microbiome, inherently. Thus, 
the evaluation of isolated cultures from activated sludge can provide insights and significan tly enhance 
biodegradation yield. In  this sense, MALDI -TOF MS, a rapid with high accuracy and sensibility technique 
for microbial identification, is a potential strategy to enhance the biodegradation of azo dye -containing 
wastewater from the textile indust ry, in particular identifying microb ial species that degrade azo dyes.

ABSTRACT  
The effects of azo dye -containing wastewater on the environment are devastati ng. Thus, it needs to be 
properly treated before its disposal - usually into water bodie s. Activated sludge is an association among 
many (micro)organisms in a community, composed of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and fungi dye -
degrading (decolourization an d mineralization). Nevertheless, there is a lack of information on specific 
degrading sp ecies and their interaction (microbiome). This information can significantly enhance the azo 
dye-containing wastewater treatments. Therefore, th is study aimed  to evalua te the bacterial community of 
an activated sludge sample from the real textile industry by isolating and identifying the Reactive Red 141 -
degrading bacteria strains. A wide range of bacteria species was identified by matrix -assisted laser 
desorption ioniza tion-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI -TOF MS) , including aerobic 
(Lysinibaciullus  fusiformis ) and facultative anaerobic ( Escherichia  coli). Preliminary data indicated the 
azo-degrading potential of Bacillus  thuringiensis  and Kosakonia  radicincitans . It is worth noting that this 
is the first report on the potential use of K. radicincita ns for decolourization. Brain Heart Infusion (BHI), 
glucose, and RR -141 were used as carbon sources. However, only BHI and glucose systems lead to 
decolourization activ ity, indicating that RR -141 cannot be used as a carbon source. Both strains exhibited 
decolourization ability, reaching 43% decolourization in BHI by B. thuringiensis , and 21% in mineral 
medium with glucose by K. radicincitans.  A yield above 40% was achiev ed by applying them 
simultaneously at the same reaction medium, at non -optimal condition s. Regarding phytotoxicity, the 
degradation result solutions did not promote the germination of the seeds, which can be associated with the 
formation of toxic aromatic amines. The HPLC -MS analyses proved that the decolourization process was 
carried out ; however, very likely, due to microbial adsorption.

 4.1 INTRODUCTION  
Global textile trade is expected to grow 4.4% between 2021 and 2028 (Grand View Research 2021) . This 
continuous g rowth of textile products manufacture is connected with a wastewater production rate above 
130 L per k g of produced fabric (Didier de Vasconcelos et al. 2021) , which comprehends a diversity of 
contaminants and toxic constituents such as dyes, resulting in an efflu ent with high biological oxygen 
demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), intensive co lour, pH, salinity, and total organic carbon 
(TOC) (Lade et al. 2012; Bilińska et al. 2016) .  
Azo dyes are recalcitrant and highly water -soluble compounds widely used by the textile industry. They 
are chemically compost of nitrogen -to-nitrogen double bond ( -N=N -) (Paździor et al. 2019) . The incorrect 
disposal of textile effluents impacts the environment holistically , for inst ance, reduc ing the oxygen 
concentration in water bodies, as well as the sunlight penetration, with consequent reduction of 
photosynthetic activity of aquatic algae and plants, the formation of aromatic amines - potentially 
carcinogenic, mutagenic, among ot hers (Paździor et al. 2017; Zhu et al. 2018) . 
Usually, the textile industry effluent treatment is composed of physical -chemical steps 
(coagulation/flocculation and decantation) followed by biological proces ses, mainly  activated sludge 
(Manekar et al. 2014) . In this sense, the activated sludge approach inherently generates appro ximately 500 
kg of sludge per m3 of wastewater (Deraniyagala 2017)  and does  not act on azo dyes (Chung and Stevens 
Jr. 1993) . In this context, the microbiome  of activated sludge from wastewater treatment plants are being 
explored to identify isolated species with dye decolourization potential (Zhu et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018; 
Li et al. 2019a) . These habitats suggest a  significant ly adapted bacterial group with a wide variety of azo 
dye degrading activity species, supporting the potential to find new and better azo dye de colour izing 
bacteria (Meerbergen et al. 2018) . Exploring activated sludges as microbial consortia is a vital perspectiv e 
to optimize biodegradation. However, the study of isolated strains from activated sludges enables the 
biodegradation pathways elucidation. MALDI -TOF -MS is highlighted as a promising methodology for 
activated sludge microbiome identif ication with conseque ntly treatment yield enhancement (Didier de 
Vasconcelos et al. 2021) . 
There fore, this study aime d to isolate and identify bacterial strains capable of de colour izing RR -141 azo 
dye from activated sludge of a treatment textile wastewater plant. The two most promising strains were 
used to investigate kinetic performance, decolouriza tion ability through UV-VIS spectrophotometry, 
possible pathways by HPLC -MS analysis, phytotoxicity, and enzyme activity identification. The scanning 
electron microscope of the activated sludge sample was also executed.  
 
4.2 MATERIAL AND METHODS  
4.2.1 Chemicals  
Reac tive Red 141 (RR -141/RHE7B), acetonitrile (CH 3CN, Sigma -Aldrich), brain heart infusion (BHI, 
KASVI), dibasic potassium phosphate (K 2HPO 4, VETEC, anhydrous), ethanol (C 2H6O, Sigma -Aldrich), 
magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4⋅7H2O, NUCLEAR), sodium chloride (NaCl, VET EC), formic acid (CH₂O₂, 
BIOTEC), α -cyano -4-hydroxycinnamic acid (C 10H7NO 3, Sigma -Aldrich), trifluoroacetic acid (CF₃COOH, 55 
 ÊXODO CIENTÍFICA), barium chloride (BaCl 2·2H 2O, DINÂMICA), methanol (CH 3OH, UV -IR-HPLC -
HPL C isocratic Panreac), calcium chloride (CaC l2·2H 2O, NEON), magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4·7H 2O, 
VETEC), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3, NUCLEAR), potassium chloride (KCl, LAFAN), dipotassium 
phosphate (K 2HPO 4, Sigma -Aldrich), monopotassium phosphate (KH 2PO 4, NUCLEAR ), ammonium 
sulfate ((NH 4)2SO 4, NUCLEAR), glucose (C 6H12O6, MERCK)  were used as chemicals, without any pre -
treatment .  
 
4.2.2 Scanning electron microscope (SEM)  
Activated sludge from the secondary settling tank of a textile industry treatment plant located at Bl umenau -
SC, Brazil, was collected  and transported to the laboratory at room temperature. The solid fraction of an 
activated sludge sample was separated from the liquid medium through centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5 
min. A Pasteur pipette extracted the aque ous phas e, and the remaining por tion was forwarded to be observed 
in a scanning electron microscope (HITACHI TM3030).  
 
4.2.3 Bacterial isolation  
Homogenized biological sludge (4 g.L-1) was added in a 37 g.L-1 of Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) solution  
and incubated at 30 °C and 150 rpm for 24 h. Posteriorly, the samples were diluted, using a dilution factor 
of 10-6, in a NaCl 0.85% solution. From this solution, 1 mL of each diluted sample was spread in BHI agar 
and grown at 30 °C for 24 h in an incubat or. The isolate d and different colonies were transferred to BHI 
agar tubes and grown at 30 °C for 24 h .  
 
4.2.4 Microbiome identification  
The incubated cells (Petri plate - BHI at 30 °C for 24 h) were transferred, with a pipette tip, to a 1.5 mL 
screw -cap extrac tion tube (Eppe ndorf, Germany) and whol ly mixed with 0.3 mL of double -distilled water. 
Absolute ethanol (0.9 mL) was added, cautiously mixed, and the tubes were centrifuged for 2 min at 20,000 
g. The supernatant was rejected. The precipitate was air -dried,  mixed thorough ly with 50 μL of formic acid 
(70%), and, subsequently, 50 μL of acetonitrile. The mixture was submitted to centrifugation (20,000 g, 2 
min). The supernatant (1 μL) was dried at room temperature on a ground steel MALDI target plate. The 
sampl es received an extra layer of 2 μL of a saturated solution of α -cyano -4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% 
acetonitrile and 2.5% trifluoroacetic acid and dried at room temperature (Marklein et al. 2009) . An 
UltrafleXtreme MALDI -TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Germany) performed the mass 
spectrometry analysis  at the linear positive ion mode. Mass spectra were obtained in a range from 2 to 20 
kDa with ions  generated by the irradiation of smartbeam using a frequency of 2000 Hz, PIE 100 ns, 7 kV 
lens (Alves et al. 2016) . For the first and second ion sources, the voltages were 25 kV and 23 kV, 
respectively. MALDI Bio typer CA System software (Bruker Daltonics, Germany) was used to identify 
bacteria with cut -off va lues higher than 1.7 for species identification (Han et al. 2015) .

 4.2.5 Screening of dye -decolour izing in solid medium  
The azo dye decolourization potential was evaluated by the streak plate method. Preculture broth (100 μL) 
of each culture was streaked on a solid medium of BHI (37 g.L-1) and RR -141 (60 mg.L-1) and incubated 
at 30 °C (Kiayi et al. 2019) . 
 
4.2.6 Screening of dye -decolour izing in the aqueous system  
RR-141 (30 mg.L-1) was added to BHI (37 g.L-1) and, separately, mineral salt media (NaCl 5g.L-1, 
MgSO 4·7H 2O 0.1 g.L-1, K 2HPO 4 10 mg.L-1, KH 2PO 4 1g.L-1, and (NH 4)2SO 4 2g.L-1) with 3g.L-1 of glucose 
(MSG) aqueous solutions and inoculated with 10% (v/v) preculture ( ≃ 1×109 cells.mL-1) into 250 mL 
Erlenmeyer flasks - working volume  120 mL - and then incubated at 30 °C, and 100 rpm during 7 days. 
Each sample was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 1 0 min , and its supernatant was analyzed by a UV/Vis 
spectrometer (Femto Cirrus  80) at λ máx = 516 nm. The removal of colour was obtained using the following 
equation: De colour ization (%) = (ABS 0 – ABS f) / ABS 0 * 100%, where ABS f is the sample absorbance 
after 7 days, and ABS 0 is the initial system absorbance. Based on the absorbance reduction, strains that 
revealed the highest de colour izing potential were selected for further carrying out tests.  
 
4.2.7 Carbon sources and kinetic study  
Considering the two strains that better removed the colour, B. thuringiensis and K. radicincitans, 
Erlenme yer experiments (in triplicate) were executed to confirm their azo dye de colour izing capability, 
evaluate differences in their decolourization rate an d their performance isolated and at consortium study. 
The consortium was standardized in the same work vol ume, considering 10% (v/v) of inoculum (CFU ≃ 
1×109 cells.mL-1 to each bacteria species) . The bacteria decolourization kinetics were evaluated in thre e 
culture media: BHI, mineral salt media without glucose (MS, NaCl 5g.L-1, MgSO 4·7H 2O 0.1 g.L-1, K2HPO 4 
10 mg.L-1, KH 2PO 4 1g.L-1, and (NH 4)2SO 4 2g.L-1), and mineral salt media with 3g.L-1 of glucose (MSG). 
The pH, optical density , and decolourization (516 nm) were measured from 0 to 120 h . 
 
4.2.8 Phytotoxicity assay  
Lactuca sativa  seeds were used for uniform and rap id germination (dos Santos et al. 2019) . Before 
inoculation, crop seeds were cleaned , and surface sterilized with 99% ethanol sol ution for 5 min and then 
washed se veral times using sterilized distilled water. Sterile Petri dishes (Ø 90 mm) were covered with 
qualitative filter paper (Unifil®, 80 g.m-2), previously sterilized. In each plate, 3 mL of the solution to be 
tested were adde d, and 10 seeds, equally spaced, o n the filter paper. Tap water (TW) was used as positive 
control (Peduto et al. 2019) . The Petri dishes were sealed and incubated (TECNAL TE -371, type BOD) at 
30 °C. The germination and growth rate were analyzed daily for 7 days. The experiment was carried out in 
duplicate.  
  57 
 4.2.9 Biodegradation analysis  
HPLC coupled  to mass spectrometry detection (H PLC–MS) was performed with a C18 column (Shimpack 
XR-ODS 50 x 2.0 mm I.D.). The samples were prepared by precipitation with BaCl 2 followed by filtration. 
The eluents A (ultrapure water containing 1% formic acid) and B (met hanol) served as mobile phase in a n 
isocratic mode (30% A and 70% B). The samples were eluted at a flow rate of 0.05 mL.min-1 and monitored 
at 370 nm. Nitrogen was used as the nebulizing gas (1.50 mL.min-1), heated sheath gas , and drying gas (3 
L.min-1, 250 °C).  
 
4.2.10  Enzyme detection  
Isolated colonies of each bacterial culture were inoculated (needle) in Petri dishes containing BHI agar and 
RR-141 (60 mg.L-1) and then incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. The halo formation diameters were calculated 
considering the diff erence between the total and the C FU diameter. The diameters were the result of two 
perpendicular axes measurement average (Barros et al. 2013) . 
 
4.3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
4.3.1 Scanning electron microscope (SEM)  
The analysis of SEM micrographs o f activated sludge indicated the presence of a biofilm matrix adhered, 
very likely flocculating bacteria. Some essential  characteristics are related to the structure and function of 
biofilm, for example, organics compounds as extracellular polymeric substa nces (EPS) , which play a 
significant role in modifying surface (charge, hydrophobicity) to give suitable conditions for bacterial 
connection (Holbrook et al. 2006; Tansel et al. 2006; Naz et al. 2013) . Large amounts of EPS and different 
bacterial species can b e found in biofilms (Weber et al. 2007) . EPS  is defined as a complex combination of 
high molecular weight microbial biopolymers. Its composition is based on humic substances, lipids, 
polysaccharides, proteins, and uronic acids. Its liquid anionic composition enables effective sequestration 
of positi vely charged species such as some dyes (Mohapatra et al. 2020) . There are two primary  forms of 
EPS: as a capsule bounded, covalently, to the cell surface, or as slime polysaccharides roughly associated 
with the cell surface, as detected in Fig ure 2. The EPS synthesis has been predictable in certain bacterial 
cultures (Bala Subramanian et al. 2010) . Gram -negative bacteria, such as E. coli , have lipopolysaccharides 
as a significant component of the outer membrane, which strongly influences  the microorganism adhesive 
aspect (Fletcher 1996) . Klebsiella  spp. can produce an adhesive slime (Bala Subramanian et al. 2010) . 
Biofilm formation may favour coloured effluent treatment. Howe ver, it is essential  to highlight  that a 
species that can  form biofilm is not necessarily  azo-degrading.

4.3.2 Microbiome identification (MALDI -TOF -MS) and maintenance  
The majo rity of  microorganisms present in the biological sludge, used as the microbial source, are presented 
in Table 5. A documental database using the keywords/booleans “strain name” AND “decolourization” 
(Table 5) was carried out to identify scientific trends i n the biological dye remediation context.  
The most abundant strain present in the activated sludge is Bacillus thuringiensis , which presents a 
moderate number of reports associated with decolo urizatio n than E. coli  and B. cereus  species (widely 
used). Som e detected bacteria , such as Kosakonia sp., have subtle correlations with decolourization ; it 
should be further evaluated.  
The isolated bacteria were maintained on BHI agar slants and  1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf, 
Germany) with a cryopreservativ e liquid (BHI Broth with glycerol, 2:8) and preserved at 20 °C for further 
assays.  
Acinetobacter baumannii , Klebsiella oxytoca , and Escherichia coli are Gram -negative bacteria widely 
related to dye decolourization. A. baumannii  aerobically decolourized two  textile azo dyes - Reactive Blue 
and Reactive Black 5 - with 90% and 87% efficiency after 48 h (Sreedharan et al. 2021) , and were also 
tested  to decolourize Reactive black 5, Reactive blue 19, Reactive red 120, and Reactive red 198 reaching 
yields above 96% (Unnikrishnan et al. 2018; Ame enudeen et al. 2021) . K. oxytoca promoted the highest 
decolourization potential of  69.68% for vat brown dye (Adebajo et al. 201 7) and achieved simultaneous 
decolourization (83.8% within 24 h) and biohydrogen production (2.47 mL.h-1) (Yu et al. 2017) . Balraj et 
al. (2016)  used E. coli  to biodegrade methylene blue. The authors reported that 92.9% of dye removal. E. 
59 
 coli spp. can also be applied simultaneously with other microorganisms such as  Pseudomonas putida (Hilda 
Josephine and Sekar 2014) , Enterobacter asburiae , E. ludwigii , and  B. thuringiensis with an excellent  yield 
of over 96% (Haque et al. 2021) .

Abo-State et al. (2017)  evaluated the potential of some bacte rial strains to decolourize  the congo red azo 
dye. The results highlighted the Gram -positive B. cereus  with the best yield (96.92%) obtained. E. coli was 
also used for Eriochrome Black T de colour ization, in which it reached 92.34% of dye removal at optimal  
conditions (Uppala et al. 2019) . Bacillus thuringiensis , a facultative anaerobic and Gram -positive 
bacterium, is promising dye -degrading specie s. However, t here are only a few reports  on its dye -degrading 
properties, including Remazol Black B, Reactive yellow 42, Reactive red 58, Reactive blue 13, and a real 
dyehouse effluent which achieved yields between 80 and 95% of decolourization (Olukanni et al. 2013; 
Joshi et al. 2014) . 
The Gram -positive bacterium Lysinibaci llus fusiformis  was used in a recent study to explore its 
discolouration capability over methyl red which provided the highest de colour izing of 96% (Sari and 
Simarani 2019) . Kosakonia radicincitans  and Kosakonia cowan ii belong to the new genus Kosakonia , in 
which some strains were isolated from plants. However, some strains are being related to facultative human 
pathogens (Mertschnigg et al. 2020) . K. cowanii , isolated from soil samples, was investigated in a 
consortium with Pseudomonas seleniipraecipitans  for congo red decolourization, wi th a maximum 
percentage of 78.5% obtained (Krishnamoorthy et al. 2018) . It is worth noting that there is no report on 
decolourization by K. radicincitans . 
Individual assays were performed to determine which cultures have the most s ignifican t ability to degra de 
azo dyes and the necessity of consortia (synergistic effects) and enzyme study. With this, it was possible to 
select the best species and perform assays using one or a consortium of microorganisms for the azo dye 
degradation. This understanding is an op portunity to develop textile wastewater treatments and increase 
yields using  strains with higher decolourization aptitude.  60 
  
4.3.3 Screening of dye -decolour izing in solid medium  
In biological processes, the bioavailability of enzymes in terferes directly with the dye transformation, 
which can be performed extracellularly and intracellularly. Nevertheless, the most effective strategy 
involves extracellular degradation (Kandelbauer and Guebitz 2005) ; since azo dyes have complex 
structures , their diffusion through cell membranes is complex. This test is strictly related to extracellular 
enzyme production and action. The visual analysis of plates (Fig ure 3) indicated that K. oxytoca , B. 
thuringiensis, K. cowanii , and K. radicincitans  colonies  have the highest potential for decolouriz ing RR-
141 (60 mg.L-1) after 168 h of incubation at 30 °C. Moreover, the decolo uration occurred primarily during 
48 h of incubation. A similar trend was observ ed by Kiayi et al. (2019) . The  solid -plate test promoted total 
decolo urization of carmoisine (50 mg/l) within 4 days by S. cerevisiae  colonies, with no visual changes in 
the fifth and sixth days.  
 
 
Figure 3: Decolourization potential study at (a) t = 0 h and (b) t = 168 h and the highest decolourized Petri 
dishes (highlighted).  
 
4.3.4 Screening of dye -decolour izing i n the aqueous system  
Considering SEM micrographs of activated sludge, biofilm -producing bacteria is a n important factor, since 
biofilm is an  excellent means to retain microorganisms and improve their performance in environmental 
biotechnologies. Proteins a nd carbohydrates from EPS allow binds between the microbial biomasses and 
substrates, favo uring their  activities. In this context, it is worth noting that the diffusion effects are essential 
to reach the high yields of biodegradability. Considering that no  biofilm was produced as an alternative to 
enhance the degradation process, the dye diffusion to the microorganism is hampered in this experiment.  
The BHI and MSG media were used to comprehend  the preferred route, concerning the performances of 
the strain s at a rich and turbid medium (BHI) and a less supplemented and more translucent medium 
(spectrophotom etric evaluation). The analysis of results confirmed B. thuringiensis  (Figure 4 ) as promising 
dye-degrading species. It also indicated that K. radicincitan s, B. cereus , and A. baumannii  as potential 
61 
 strains for the RR -141 degradation. Added to the solid medium assay results and considering the number 
of reports related to each species (Table 5), B. thuringiensis  (B) and  K. radicincitans  (K) were chosen for 
further studies.

4.3.5 Carbon sources and dye -degrading kinetic by B. thuringiensis  or K. radicincitans - 
enzymatic or metabolic degradation  
Considering th e hypothesis of media composition influence in the degradation process, BHI, MSG, and MS 
were used to evaluate the kinetic and behavio ur of each bacterial culture about  carbon source, enzyme 
production, and spectrophotometric interferences.  
Cell growth ex pressed by the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) plus pH revealed the bacteria growth at, 
as expected, the BHI as the most appropriate medium for the development of both  strains. No relevant 
modification was detected in the MS medium (absence of carbon sou rce, except azo -dye), which could 
indicate the lack of ability of the cultures to use the dye as a primary carbon source (Fig ure 5).  At the 
microbial level, the azo dye  biodegradation mechanism  is controlled by enzymes (Saratale et al. 2007) . 
Considering the res ults from solid -state media, enzyme interference can be regarded as  in decolo urization 
processes. Azoreductases, laccases, and peroxidases are the enzymes frequently related to azo dye 
decolourization (Shah et al. 2016; Mullai et al. 2017; Chandanshive et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2018) . 
Azor eductase action is through reduction mechanisms mediated by a flavoprotein in the microbial electron 
transport chain (Misal and Gawai 2018) , which converts azo dyes into colo urless products (aromatic 
amines) (Pandey et al. 2007) . Laccases action can be by direct or indirect oxidation (Khlifi et al. 2010)  
through a nonspecific free radical mechanism that results in phenolic products and avoids the formation of 
aromatic amines (Wong and Yu 1999) . The peroxidase  mechanism comprises  the phenolic group oxidation 
and the production of a radical close to the azo linkages  (Chivukula and Renganathan 1995) . Enzyme action 
comprehension and identification at each metabolism stage are essential to improve  the degradation process 
and are indicated for further studies. From the kinetic analysi s, Bacillus  strain had a better performance at

better performance of B. thuringiensis  at both media (Fig ure 6 ).

Since  single isolated  culture  presented  exciting perspectives to  be explored , the experimentation of bacterial 
consort ium was realized to verify the viability of higher yields and better processes.   
 
4.3.6 Dye-degrading kinetic by B. thuringiensis  and K. radicincitans as a consortium  
Degradation of azo dyes is usually perfor med by a consortium of species. It is expected that the co -
metabolism of a microbial community promotes better conditions and results for biodegradation and 
mineralization of azo dyes. Some microbial consortia had a chieved yields and objectives that no ind ividual 
strain could reach successfully in biodegradation studies (Neifar et al. 2019; Shindhal et al. 2021; 
Samuchiwal et al. 2021) . Besides, mixed culture eval uations are more similar to practical sit uations since 
aseptically conditions can add more cost in the process, higher stability over environmental stress such as 
composition, pH , or temperature variations. The synergistic action can occur by different pat hways: i) a 
microorganism causes dye biot ransformation, rendering it more reachable to another organism that would 
not be able to act on this dye at its original state; ii) an only microorganism promotes some solution 
decolourization by the modification of  the chromophore ; however, the complete d egradation is not 
achieved, and the metabolic products may have a toxic nature, as at an anaerobic reduction of azo dyes. 
Once this unwished metabolite is taken as a nutrient source by another microorganism, the com plete 
degradation, leading to carbon diox ide, ammonia, and water, can be achieved (only by mixed populations). 
64 
 This mineralization reaction assures no potentially harmful degradation products are released into the 
environment (Kandelbauer and  Guebitz 2005) . 
In this study, the consortium evaluation revealed a well -development at both media, with MSG promoting 
better conditions for higher decolourization yield (Fig ure 7). Compared to the isolated kinetic  study, the 
decolourization process achie ved better results in a minor period, with approximately 36% of 
decolourization yield within 12  h, associated with a synergic effect.  
 
  
 
Figure 7:  Microbial growth, pH, decolourization rates, and picture of the consortia sys tem at BHI and 
MSG media.  
It is not easy to reproduce and effectively interpret the results when using mixed cultures because it only 
provides a wide view of what is happening in  the system, difficult the identification and quantification of 
individual cul ture growth, hampers the elucidation of the degradation mechanism (Didier de Vasconcelos 
et al. 2 021). For these reasons, the use and deep comprehension of colour removal by single bacterial 
cultures are essential since it promotes a  more straightforward  interpretation of e xperimental observations 
and reproducibility (Thakur  et al. 2014) .  
 
4.3.7 Phytotoxicity assay  
Phytotoxicity assays are expected to p resent a reduction in toxic levels with the coloured wastewater. Some 
negative results in toxicity assays are related to the formation of some toxic substances, such as aromatic 
amines, that can act as an inhibitory factor (Tabasum et al. 2019; Carvalho et  al. 2020; Didier de

 Vasconcelos et al. 2021). Nevertheless, some of these experiments reveal that an excellent decolo urization 
index is not necessarily associated with completin g degradation processes .  
The analysis of phytotoxicity (Fig ure 8) revealed th e toxic nature of Reactive Red 141 to the Lactuca sativa  
seeds. Germination rate was lower with Reactive Red 141 (60% , i.e., 6 of 10 seeds germinated, on average) 
when compared t o tap water (80% , i.e., 8 of 10 seeds germinated, on average). The Reactive Re d 141 
degradation products were significantly inhibitory for the germination of the plants, which indicates the 
formation of phytotoxic compounds. Azo dyes and some of their meta bolites present carcinogenic, toxic, 
and mutagenic properties to the environme nt and humankind (Kalme et al. 2007) . Bacterial azo dye 
degradation comprises the cleavage of azo bonds and the intermediates breakdown. However, three 
mechanism routes promote the carcinogenic activation of azo dyes: i) direct oxidation of azo linkage to 
diazonium sal ts with highly reactive electrophilic behavio ur; ii) oxidation of azo dyes in the presence of 
structures formed by free aromatic amine groups; and iii) reduction and cleavage of the azo bond with 
consequent formation of aromatic amines (Brown and De Vito 1993; Chung 2000) .  
 
 
Figure 8: Phytotoxicity experiments: (a) in RR -141 solution, (b) tap water.  
 
4.3.8 Biodegr adation analysis  
The HPLC -MS analysis was performed to confirm the dye quantity reduction. The chromatograms of dye 
solutions at the initial and after eac h studied media treatment  were obtained (Fig ure 9 ). The HPLC profile 
of the RR -141 solution in both me dia exhibited a single peak at retention times of 4.53 and 4.63 min to BHI 
and MSG, respectively (matrix effect - chromatography). The assay results of th e solution after treatment 
exposed peaks corresponding to RR 141 with reduced intensity, which indicat es that the compound was not 
complete ly degraded. The absence of different peaks in the chromatograms of treated solutions contributes 
to a possible adsor ption strand by the biomass generated, which can be observed in Figure 10 that shows 
the concentrated biomass after a centrifugation process for some studied strains (Pearce et al. 2003; 
Rodrigues et al. 2014; Siddiqui et al. 2018) . Once adsorption seems to have a more significant influence o n 
the decolourization phenomena, another speculation can be done relating the effect of culture media and  
the biomass composition and adsorption, consequently.

systems samples  (B.MSG, BK.MSG and K.BHI) .

4.3.9 Enzyme identification  
All tested st rains showed, after 24 h, a halo formation represented by a more translucid area surrounding 
the CFU  (Figure 11) that could  be associated with extracellular enzyme production (Barros et al. 2013) . 
Considering the halos measurement (Table 6), K. radicincitans  presented the best results , which suppose 
good development (Fig ure 5 , OD graphic) and consequent enzy matic activity. In addition, the cell growth 
on dye supplemented BHI ag ar medium with white colonies aspect can be associated with dye decolouring 
potential. Since cell mat colo uring results from dye biosorption, the maintenance of the original mat colo ur 
indicates biodegradation by an enzymatic process (Karim et al. 2018) . 
Oxidative and reductive enzymes are considered vital parts in azo dye biodegradation (Mahmood et al. 
2016) . Azo dye remediation inter mediated by enzymes can be intra or extracellular. However, the high 
complexity of azo dyes hamper their diffusion through cell membranes, so the preferable route is by the 
enzyme release in the extracellular environment (Sari and Simarani 2019) . Microbial strains used in the 
decolourization process must have efficient enzymes and  a transport system to permit the absorption of 
dyes in cells (Mahmood et al. 2016) . Enzymes improve the reductive cleavage  of azo bonds , producing 
intermediate metabolites posteriorly degraded by aerobic or anaerobic mechanisms (Pandey et al. 2007) .

 Azoreductases, laccases and peroxidases are the enzymes often related to azo dye discolo uration. The action 
of azoreductase is through reduction mechanisms mediated by a flavoprotein in the microbial electron 
transport chain (Mis al and Gawai 2018) , which converts azo dyes into colo urless products (aromatic 
amines) (Pandey et al. 2007) . The laccases  act either  by direct or indirect oxidation (Khlifi et al. 2010) , 
through an unspe cific free radical mechanism tha t results in phenolic products and prevents the formation 
of aromatic amines (Wong and Yu 1999) . The peroxidase mechanism comprises the oxidation of the 
phenolic group and the production of a radical close to the azo bonds (Chivukula and Renganathan 19 95).

4.4 CONCLUSION S AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES  
Colo ured textile wastewater can negatively impact the environment when disposed incorrectly. Bacterial 
species isolated from the textile industry (activated sludge) were identifi ed and tested for decolo urization, 
considering dye solutions with BHI, mineral salt medium with and without glucose as culture medium. As 
a result, the bacter ial isolates did not utilize the azo dye as their sole energy source  and achieved exciting 
yields.  Kosakonia radicincitans  and Bacillus  thuringiensis  presented the bests decolo urization results. The 
kinetic study revealed 21% in mineral medium with glucose  by K. radicincitans , and 43% of 
decolo urization in BHI by B. thuringiensis.  The use of both cultures in the same reaction medium (MSG) 
promoted approximately 40% decolo urization, indicating the potential use of mixed bacterial cultures as a 
bioremediation  agent for cost -effective dye removal  from textile effluent. Phytotoxicity a ssay and HPLC -
68 
 MS analyses suggested that the degradation was not complete. In addition, a potential enzyme action was 
inferred  by the translucid  halo formation observed, which can be associated with extracellular enzyme 
production . This work is believed to  be an important contribution to the biodegradation of azo dyes by 
bacterial cultures isolated from activated sludge from the textile industry  theme . Besides, the  innovation in 
the utilization of Kosakonia  sp. as a potential degradation  agent .
