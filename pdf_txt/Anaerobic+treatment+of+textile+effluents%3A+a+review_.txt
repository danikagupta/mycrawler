Abstract   In the present study, an attempt was made to examine the potential of isolated bact erium for 
decolo rization of Remazol Black B  dye in batch reactors. A potential bacterial strain was isolated and selected from 
the textile effluent on the basis of rapid azo dye Remazol Black B ( 250mgl–1) decolorization and later identified as 
belonging to genus Bacillus based on phenotypic characterization. The effect of pH, temperature, carbon & nitrogen 
source  was studied with an aim to determine the optimal conditions required for maximum decolorization and 
degradation. Decolorization was effective at pH 8, 35°C with s tarch and peptone as carbon and nitrogen sources and 
in static conditions. This decolorization potential increased the applicability of this microorganism for the dye 
removal.  The results show that the isolated bacterium  has a dynamic potential in removal of Remazol Black B  dye 
from wastewater under aerobic conditions.

1. Introduction  
Rapid industrialization has necessitated the 
manufacture and use of different chemicals in day to day 
life (Moorthi et al., 2007, Baljeet et al., 2001) . The textile 
industry is  one of them which extensively use synthetic 
chemicals as dyes.  Wastewaters from textile industries 
pose a threat to the  environment, as large amo unt of 
chemically different dyes are  used. A significant 
proportion of these dyes enter the  environment via 
wastewater. Approximately 10,000 different  dyes and 
pigments are used industrially and over 0.7 million  tons of 
synthetic dyes are produced annually , worldwide  (Rafi et 
al., 1990) . Pollution due to textile industry effluent has 
increased during  recent years. Moreover, it is very 
difficult to treat textile  industry effluents because of their 
high BOD, COD, heat, color,  pH and the presence of 
metal ions  (Anjali P et al., 2007) . The textile finishing  
generates a large amount of waste water containing dyes 
and represents one of the largest causes of water pollution  
(Bhatti HN et al., 2008) , as 10 -15% of dyes are lost in the 
effluent during the dyeing proce ss (Zollinger H, 1991) . 
The traditional textile finishing industry consumes about 100 liters of water to process about 1 Kg of textile 
material. The new  closed -loop technologies such as the 
reuse of microbial or  enzymatical treatment of dyeing 
effluents co uld help reducing this enormous water 
pollution  (Abadull E et al., 2000) . Azo dyes have been 
used increasingly in industries because of  their ease and cost effectiveness in synthesis compared to  natural dyes. 
However, most azo dyes are toxic, carcinogenic and 
mutagenic  (Pinherio HM et al., 2004) . Azo bonds present 
in these compounds are  resistant to breakdown, with the 
potential for the persistence and  accumulation in the 
environment  (Talarposhti et al., 2001) . However, they can 
be degraded by bacteria unde r aerobic and anaerobic 
conditions  (Woong & Yueen., 1996) . Several physico -
chemical techniques have been proposed for  treatment of 
colored textile effluents. These include adsorption  on 
different materials, oxidation and precipitation by Fenton’s  reagent, bleaching with chloride or ozone photo 
degradation or  membrane filtration  (Robinson et al., 2001) . 
All these physical or chemical methods  are very expensive 
and result in the production of large amounts  of sludge, 
which creates the secondary level of land pollution.  
Therefore, economic and safe removal of the polluting dyes is  still an important issue. Bioremediation through 
microorganisms  has been identified as a cost effective and 
environment friendly alternative for disposal of textile 
effluent  (Chen KC et al., 2003 , Ponraj et al., 2011) . In 
recent years a number of studies have focused on some  
microorganisms capable of degrading and absorbing dyes 
from  wastewater. A wide variety of microorganisms are 
reported to  be capable of decolonization of dyes  (Che n 
KC et al., 2003,  Chang et al., 2000, Chang et al., 2001, Fu 
Y, 2002, Saikia N., 2004, Fournier et al., 2004, Aksu, 
2003, Gupta et al, 2006, Acuner E, 2004, De -Bashan et al., 
2002, Valderama et al., 2002, Yan H, 2004, Gupta et al., 
2004, Kumar et al., 2005, Sneath et al, 1984, Arun Prasad 
et al., 2010, Tripathi A et al., 2012, Modi HA et al., 2010, 44 International Journal of Environmental Bioremediation & Biodegradation   
Ola et al., 2010, Khan JA et al., 2011, Namdhari BS et al., 
2012, Kumar Praveen et al., 2012, Raj Kumar S et al., 
2012) . The current study  has evaluated the pot ential of 
isolated bacterial strain from  textile effluent for their 
decolorization efficiency of the textile  dye, Remazol 
Black B  under in vitro conditions and optimization of the  
factors influencing the process.  
2. Materials & Methods 
2.1. Sampling and A nalysis of E ffluent  
The Effluent  sample was collected from the middle 
point of the area.  Standard procedures (Spot and Grab) 
were followed during  sampling. The Temperature and pH 
were determined at the sampling site. The pH was 
determined by using pH meter  and temperature with  
laboratory thermometer. The sample was transported to  
laboratory at 4ºC as in accordance with the standard  
methods (Yatome et al. , 1981). The physicochemical  
parameters such as (Colour, Biological Oxidation Demand  
(BOD) Chemical Oxygen  Demand (COD), Total 
Suspended  Solids (TSS), and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) 
were  determined as soon as the sample was brought to the  
laboratory. Sample colour was analysed by  
spectrophotometer. BOD was determined by employing 
evaporation method by DO met er while COD was 
measured  by COD instrument directly.  
2.2. Chemicals  
The textile dye, Remazol Black B  (λmax 5 95 nm) was 
obtained from Ankleshwar  Textile Industries, Ankleshwar, 
Gujarat, India . Nutrient broth (gL–1Peptone -5, Meat 
extract -1, Yeast extract - 2, NaCl -5, pH -7) A stock solution 
of the dye (1000mgL–1) was prepared in de -ionized water 
and used for all studies.   
2.3. Isolation, Screening and I dentification of 
Dye Decolorizing B acteria from E ffluent  
The textile effluent was  collected in sterile collec tion 
tubes from the sludge and  wastewater of the ditches at 
industrial site located in Ankleshwar Textile Industries, 
Gujarat, India . The sample collected from the textile mill 
was screened for azo dye ( Remazol Black B ) decolorizing 
bacterial strains by in oculating 10 ml. of sludge  solution 
into 250ml. Erlenmeyer flask containing 100ml.  nutrient 
broth (gL–1 Peptone -5, Meat extract -1, Yeast extract - 2, 
NaCl -5, pH -7). The flasks were incubated at 35°C under  
shaking conditions (1 20rpm). After 48h of incubation , 1.0 
ml. of the culture broth was appropriately diluted and 
plated  on Nutrient Agar (gL–1 Peptone -5, Meat extract -1, 
Yeast  extract -2, NaCl -5, Agar -15, pH -7.0) containing 25  
mg L–1 Remazol Black B . The Morphologically distinct 
bacterial isolates  showing cl ear zones around their 
colonies due to  decolorization of dye were selected for 
further studies. The  pure culture stocks of these isolates 
were stored at 4°C on  Nutrient Agar slopes containing 
1000 mg L–1 of Remazol Black B . These isolates were 
screened for  their ability to  decolorize Remazol Black B  
in liquid culture.  The Screening process in liquid media 
was carried out  by inoculating a loop full of cultures 
exhibiting clear zones  into Nutrient broth containing 
Remazol Black B  under static  conditions. Afte r 24h of incubation, 1ml. of cell suspension  was transferred to 
fresh nutrient broth containing Remazol Black B  to screen 
the strains with color removing ability. The  Screening 
procedure in liquid medium was continued until  complete 
decolorization of broth . A small amount of  decolorized 
broth was transferred to nutrient agar plates  containing 
Remazol Black B  (250 mgL–1). The bacterial isolate  
which tolerated higher concentration of the Azo dye was  
isolated by streak plate method. The Azo dye decolorizing  
bacteria was identified from several aspects including  
morphology characters, biochemical tests as described in  
Bergey's manual of determinative bacteriology (Indole,  
Methyl Red, Voges -Proskauer test, Citrate, Catalase, 
Oxidase,  Nitrate Reduction test, Hydro lysis of Casein, 
Starch, Urea and Gelatin). Assimilation of various sugars 
such as  D-glucose, D -fructose, galactose, mannitol and D -
maltose  as sole carbon source was determined by 
inoculating the  isolate into carbohydrate broth 
supplemented with  respective carbon source. After 
inoculation the tubes were  incubated at 37ºC for 24- 48h. 
2.4. Decolorization A ssay 
The decolorizing activity was  expressed in terms of the 
percentage decolorization by the modified method 
described previously (Deepak et al. , 2004).  The 
Decolorization process was carried out using shaking  
culture and static culture by inoculating 1ml. of pre  
cultured(O.D 0.8 -1) Bacillus spp. into 100ml. of sterilized 
Nutrient  broth in 250 ml. Erlenmeyer flask and incubated 
on rotary  shaker (1 20 rpm) at 35ºC for 24h (Kalyani et al. , 
2009). Filter  sterilize  Remazol Black B  (250 mgL–1 ) was 
added  to the culture and incubated in shaking conditions at 
120rpm  and in static conditions at room temperature for  
decolorization to occur. At regular intervals, 4 ml.s ample  
was withdrawn aseptically and centrifuged at 8 ,000 rpm  
for 1 0min. The cell free supernatant was used to determine  
the percentage decolorization of Remazol Black B . 
Decolorization of dye was determined by monitoring the  
decrease in absorbance at the m aximum wavelength of  
Remazol Black B  (λmax 5 95 nm) by using a UV -Visible  
spectrophotometer (UV -1800 pharmaspec, shimadzu , 
Japan ). The  Uninoculated dye Medium supplemented with 
respective dye was used as blank (Jacob Thomson, 1998).  
Decolorization activity (%) was calculated by the 
following  formula and all assays were done in triplicate:  
 100%Initial OD Observed ODDecolorizationInitial OD×=  
2.5 Decolorization of Crystal Violet under 
Different C ulture C onditions  
The decolorization efficiency of Bacillus spp. strain 
was compared over  a wide range of pH (5 -9) by adjusting 
the pH with hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. Decolorization at different Temperatures (RT, 35°C, 37°C, 
40°C, 45°C, 50°C) was carried out by adjusting the pH to 
8. Varying Carbon sources 1% each (dulcitol, starch , 
maltose, sucrose, dextrose, mannitol, d -xylose,  lactose, 
mannose)and Nitrogen sources 1% each (urea,  potassium 
nitrate, sodium nitrate, malt extract, ammonium  sulphate, 
ammonium nitrate, ammonium chloride, peptone)  were 
used to check the decolorizing pot ential of the strain.  All 
the flasks were incubated in static conditions at pH 8  and 
at 35°C.   International Journal of Environmental Bioremediation & Biodegradation  45 
3. Results  
3.1. Physico -chemical Characterization of 
Textile E ffluent  
The effluent sample collected from Ankleshwar Textile 
Industries, Ankleshwar, Gujarat, India, was black in color, 
with pungent smell and pH of slightly above neutral level 
and was within the permissible limits. The temperature of 
the effluent was high. Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and 
Total  Dissolved Solids (TDS) in the textile effluent were 
very high. The solids present in ground water, besides 
effecting  the growth of the plants directly, also affect the 
soil structure, permeability and aeration, indirectly 
effecting the  plant growth. The Chemical Oxygen Demand 
(COD) and  Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) values 
were within the  permissible limits in the effluent sample. 
Different bacterial  strains isolated from the textile effluent 
were screened for  their ability to decolorize the textile 
Azo dye ( Remazol Black B ) and the potential strains were 
characterized morphologically,  & biochemically  for 
identification.  3.2. Isolation and I dentification  
The study was started  by screening for potential textile 
Azo dye decolorizing  bacteria isolated from the textile 
industry effluent. Colonies  surrounded by a near ly 
decolorized zone were isolated and  then tested for dye 
removal capability using submerged  culture. Strains 
isolated from the white colonies were inoculated in 100ml. 
of Nutrient broth in a 250ml. conical flask and incubated 
at 35°C under static conditio ns. One  strain exhibiting 
highest decolorizing activity was chosen  for further 
studies. The gram staining test showed the  isolate to be 
non-motile, gram positive, spore forming, and rod-shaped 
bacteria. The spore was terminally located and  ellipsoidal 
in shape. Biochemical characterization of the isolate 
revealed it to be negative for Indole, Methyl Red  test, 
Voges -Proskauer, Citrate, Catalase, oxidase test and  
Nitrate Reduction test. The isolate showed negative result  
for the hydrolysis of casein, gelatin,  starch and urea. The 
strain utilized various sugars, D -Maltose, D -Glucose, 
DFructose,  Mannitol and Galactose as sole carbon sources  
and was found to be positive.

3.3. Effect of pH and Temperature on 
Decolorization  
The decolorization efficiency of Bacillus spp. was 
compared  across a range of pH (5 -9). The maximum 
decolorization  (95%) was recorded at pH 8. At neutral pH 
the strain  exhibited a percentage decolorization value of 
80%.Where as it was 55% and 50% at pH 6 and 9.The 
percentage decolorization decreased markedly at pH 5 
(12%) due to acidic  conditions ( Figure 1 ). The optimum pH for growth and  decol orization was found to be 8. The 
dye decolorization  activity of the strain was found to 
decrease with increasing  incubation temperature. Highest 
decolorization was achieved  at 35°C (9 5%) and least 
percentage decolorization was at  Room Temperature 
(30°C ) (27%). At 37°C there was 85 % decolorization 
noted followed by 70%, 45% and 20% at  40°C, 45°C and 
50°C respectively at the end of 24h  incubation ( Figure 2 ). 
No specific decolorization was observed  in shaking 
conditions (1 20 rpm).

efficiency with 9 5% followed by Dextrose  (85%) and mannose  (75%) at the end of 24h incubation period.  The 
decolorization efficiency decreased with mannitol (50%), 
dulcitol (35%), d-xylose  (27%), lactose  (22%) and sucrose  
(15%). Least decolorization was observed with maltose  
(10%). Maximum decolorization with nitr ogen sources 
was achieved with Peptone ( 90%) and least was with Malt 
extract  (12%). Urea and Ammonium sulphate exhibited  International Journal of Environmental Bioremediation & Biodegradation  47 
good decolorization with 82% and 75%. The 
decolorization  efficiency decreased markedly with 
Ammonium nitrate ( 50%),  Sodium nitrate ( 22%),

4. Discussion  
Industrial effluent is not stable and it varies often in a  
wide range depending upon the process practiced. South 
Asian countries are experiencing severe environmental  
problems due to ra pid industrialization. This phenomenon  
is very common where the polluting industries like textile  
dyeing, leather tanning, paper and pulp processing, sugar  
manufacturing, etc. thrive as clusters. Among these the  
Textile industries are large industrial cons umers of waters  
as well as producers of wastewater. The effluent 
discharged  by this industry leads to serious pollution of 
groundwater  and soils and ultimately affects the livelihood 
of the poor  (Jiunkins et al. , 1982). The physico -chemical 
characterizatio n of the collected textile effluent sample 
from Ankleshwar  Textile  Industries, Ankleshwar, Gujarat, 
India  showed a high load of pollution indicators. Colour is 
contributed to a water body by the  dissolved compounds 
(dyes and pigments). The effluent  color w as black due to 
mixture of various dyes and  chemicals used in the dyeing 
process. The pH of the study sample was slightly alkaline 
when compared to the acidic pH of the dyeing effluent in 
a previous study (Tyagi et al. , 1990). The pH of the 
effluent alters  the physico -chemical  properties of water 
which in turn adversely affects aquatic life, plant and 
humans. The soil permeability gets affected  resulting in 
polluting underground resources of water  (Vandevivre et 
al., 1998). The temperature of the effluent  was high in 
comparison with the temperature of another  effluent in 
one study (Kumar et al. , 1989). High temperature  
decreases the solubility of gases in water which is 
ultimately  expressed as high BOD/COD. Sediments rate is  
drastically increased because of High value of Total  
Dissolved Solids which reduces the light penetration into  
water and ultimately decrease the photosynthesis. The 
decrease in photosynthetic rate reduces the DO level of  
wastewater which results in decreased purification of  
wastewater by microorganisms (Delee et al. , 1998). The  
current sample exhibited high values of heavy metals which  were of the same order of magnitude reported in 
another  effluent sample (Kim et al. , 1994). The nutrients 
of the  surrounding soils are depleted as a result of high 
value of  heavy metals thereby affecting soil fertility. High 
chloride  contents are harmful for agricultural crops if such 
wastes  containing high chlorides are used for irrigation 
purposes.  (Agarwal et al. , 1996). Majority of the textile 
effluent sa mples  have permissible limits of sulphate ions. 
The effluent  showed phenolic contents greater than 0.1 
ppm which is  though permissible limit of the phenolic 
compounds still  these compounds are very toxic to fish 
even at very low  concentrations (Coughlin et  al., 1997). 
The bleaching and  dying process are the main causes of 
pollutants which  include caustic soda, hypochlorite and 
peroxides. The isolation of different microorganisms from the effluent sample collected from the Ankleshwar  Textile 
Industries,  Guja rat, India  indicates to natural adaptation of 
microorganisms  to survive in the presence of toxic 
chemicals and dyes.  Interest in the bioremediation of 
pollutants using bacteria  has intensified in recent years, as many researches  demonstrated the efficacy o f bacterial 
bioremediation over  fungal and Actinomycetes. Many 
bacteria capable of  reducing Azo dyes reported were 
isolated from Textile  effluent contaminated sites (Dawkar 
et al. , 2008). A strain of bacterium Bacillus spp. with 
strong decolorizing ability  was isolated from Textile 
effluent to decolorize the textile  Azo dye Remazol Black 
B (250 mgL
–1) within 24h in aerobic  and static conditions. 
The reason for the decreased  decolorization under shaking 
conditions could be  competition of oxygen and dye 
compounds for the reduced  electron carriers under aerobic 
conditions. The percentage decolorization of Remazol 
Black B  by Bacillus spp. strain under static conditions was 
95% within 24h of incubation which was equal to a 
similar study  but with 35h of incubation period (Khehra et 
al., 2005). In  another study conducted with Pseudomonas 
putida, P.fluorescence, Bacillus cereus and Stentrophomonas  acidaminiphila to decolorize Acid Red 
88 showed their  efficiencies at 35%, 31%, 40% and 50% 
respectively  (Hu et al. , 1998 ). Under aerobic conditions 
azo dyes are generally resistant to attack by bacteria 
(Daneshvar et al. , 2007). The optimal pH for complete 
decolorization of Remazol Black B  was at 8 which is 
slightly in accordance with  Cosmarium sp.  Decolorizing 
malachite gr een at pH 9  (Wong and Yuen, 1998) and 
Klebsiella pneumonia RS -13 which completely degraded 
Methyl Red in pH range of 6  to 8 (Mali et al. , 2000). 
Optimal growth temperature of was  found to be 35°C 
which is consistent with the highest  decolorization 
temperat ure in our study. Maximum potential  of 
Pseudomonas sp. to decolorize Malachite green, fast  green 
was noticed at 37°C (Adedayo et al. , 2004). Vibrio  logei 
and Pseudomonas nitroreducens showed the highest  
Methyl Red degradation activity at 30 -35°C (Kapdan et  al., 
2000). Starch and Peptone were found to be most effective  
carbon and nitrogen sources for decolorization of  Remazol 
Black B  by in the present study compared to Lactose and  
Yeast extract in another similar study for decolorization of  
Everzol Red RBN ( Panswed and Wongehaisuwan, 1986).  
5. Conclusion  
Although decolorization is a challenging process to  
both the textile industry and the waste water treatment, the  
result of this findings and literature suggest a great  
potential for bacteria to be used to rem ove color from dye  
wastewaters. Interestingly, the bacterial species used in  
carrying out the decolorization of Azo dye Remazol Black B in this study was isolated from the textile dye industry 
waste  effluent. The bacterial  strain Bacillus s pp.  showed  
deco lorizing activity through a degradation mechanism. 
This observation has established  that the bacteria are 
adaptive in nature and can degrade contaminants. The 
ability of the strain to tolerate, decolorize  azo dyes at high 
concentration gives it an advantage for  treatment of textile 
industry waste waters. However,  potential of the strain 
needs to be demonstrated for its  application in treatment 
of real dye bearing waste waters  using appropriate 
bioreactors.
