Abstract:The productivity of laccaseusing white rot fungus Trametes hirsuta was observed in a shaking liquid
culture. Gradual increments in laccase production were achieved via screening of the carbon, nitrogen and
inducer by one factor at a time method. Time course of laccase production and time course of inducer
additionwas monitored.Laccase production of around 9300 U/Lwas obtained with wheat bran as the carbon
source, which is one of the lignocellulosic materialsabundantly found as an agro industrial waste, and the
production was increased to 17390 U/L with wheat bran and peptone combination. Addition of 1mM 2, 5
xylidinein combination with 1mM copper sulphate on third day enhanced the laccase production to 23543U/L.
Further enhancement in laccase production and the influence of significant media components
wereaccomplishedusing plakettburmann design (PB) statistical method with the maximum laccase activity of
25889 U/L. The following components viz, wheat bran, peptone, magnesium sulphate, copper sulphate and 2, 5
xylidine were found to be the significant media components.

Introduction
Laccase(benzenediol:oxygenoxidoreductases, (EC. 1.10.3.2) ,Phylogenitically an old enzyme of oxidoreductase
family and major secretome of many of the white rot fungi than MnP and lip. Capable of oxidizing organic and
inorganic compounds particularly phenols with formation of water1.It comprises four catalytic copper atoms viz,
one T1copper, two T2 copper and a T3 copper, placed in different position according to their spectroscopic
property2.It has widely been found in nature, such as p lants3, 4, fungi5, 6, bacteria7, 8 andinsects9, 10
respectively.Diverse group of fungi viz white rot, brown rot, and leaf litter fungi with different nutrition patterns
have been found in the phylum basidiomycota and possess unique features like edible  in nature, medicinal,
biotechnological and environmental  importance. Notwithstanding that the fungi from white rot basidiomycets
have the potential to degrade completely all wood constituents such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin by
their enzymatic sy stems viz, lign inolytic and hydrolytic enzymes11,12.Ligninolytic enzyme production by the
wood rotting fungi is a phenomenon  that the combined interaction between the physiology of fungi and theBakkiyaraj S. et al/Int.J.ChemTech Res.2013,5( 3) 1225
composition of essential media used for cultivation. There a re some instances have distinctly proved the
statement that in a synthetic medium, the white rot fugus Phanerochaete chrysosporium  has expressed the both
peroxidases (MnP,LiP) o nly in a nitrogen limited media13. In contrast both peroxidases and the oxidati ve
enzyme laccase were produced when cultivated in a media containing lignocellulosic substrate as carbon source
and a highly concentrated organic nitroge n source have led to the change14.The pattern of laccase expression by
the wood degrading fungi and sp ecies is a inconsistent  process and vary one another, also its production can be
influenced by different c ultivation modes and conditions15,16. Almost, laccases from the majority of lignolytic
fungi have been expressed in low quantities in the culture flui d17, albeit the production has been induced with
aid of compounds such as ferulic acid, 2,5 -xylidine, p -anisidine or veratryl alcohol that belong to the aromatic or
phenoliccompounds  relatedto lignin or lignin derivatives18.The implementation of many app lications attributed
on laccase is possible only by increasing the production to larger amount as well as with low production cost.
The utilization of lignocellulosic wastes and its byproducts facilitates  the laccase production  economical and
high yield, due to the presence some naturally available inducers along  with the soluble carbohydrates19.This
enzyme able to degrad e lignin and hazardous compouds1, oxidation of both phenolic andnon-phenolic
compounds, synthetic dyes respectively .Owing to versatile ca pabilityof this enzyme it has been utilized in
various industrial applicatio ns viz biopulping and bleaching 1, textile industry21,22, food industry23, synthesis of
organic chemicals24, biosensors25etc.Based on the striking biotechnological applications of  laccase,
extraordinary efforts have been devoted towards the optimization ofprocess for improving the laccase
production using various groups of microorganisms by different researchers so far. The problem ever associated
with this enzyme is minimization of production cost. Searching of low cost, as well as easily available raw
materials make the production process economical. Laccase production has been improved by the use of
inducers for white fungi have frequently been performed especially the aromatic compounds26.The present work
isfocused on the laccase production by the use of agro industry waste wheat bran as carbon source to achieve
the economical and better production. Also several aromatic inducers were examined to increase laccase
production.  The statistical toolplakett-Burmann design implemented to screen the prominent process variables
for laccase production by white rot fu ngusT. hirsuta .

Experimental work
Time course of laccase production
In order to predict the optimum fermentation period of laccase production by the organism was observed with
respect to the cell mass concentration . Samples were taken every 24 hour for analysis.Bakkiyaraj S. et al/Int.J.ChemTech Res.2013,5( 3) 1226
Time course of copper sulphate addition
To establish a precise time period to incorporate the copper sulphate in the produ ction media for increasing the
laccase production was studied. So the optimum concentration of copper sulphate was added with an interval of
24 hour till 5th day.
Time course of 2, 5 xylidine addition
To establish the proper time period to add 2, 5 xylidin e in the media for enhancing  the laccase production was
examined. So the optimum xylidine concentration was added, from the inoculation period to 5th day of the
fermentation.
Effect of lignocellulosic material on laccase production
In order to reduce the p roduction cost as well as to achieve better laccase production different lignocellulosic
materials were examined for laccase production. Various ligninocellulosic materials such as rice bran, wheat
bran, elephant grass, waste paper, orange peeling, lemon peeling, water hyacinth and baggase, were collected
from the local market and they were powdered and dried at 60oC. The basal media cultivated with 20 g of eac h
lignocellulosic material and flask with glucose was maintained as control.
Effect of nitrogen so urce on laccase production
To assess the impact of nitrogen source on laccase production was studied in single and mixed mode . Nitrogen
sources such as peptone,  urea,L-aspargine, yeast extract, m alt extract,NH 4SO4,tryptone, yeast extract +
NH2SO4,yeast extract + L -Asparagine, yeast extract + malt extract ,urea + peptone, Peptone + NH 2SO4 and
peptone + yeast extract maintained as control. All the nitrogen sources were  taken in the range of 10 g/l of the
basal media for single mode and 5 g/l for mixedmode.
Effect of inducers on laccase production
Different inducers such as 2,5 xylidine, 2,4 dimethoxy phenol, 1- napthol, veratryl alcohol,  g alic acid, Ferulic
acid, hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT), were examined for enhancing the  laccase production. Except guaiacol and
vanilic acid, all the compounds were dissolved in 5% ethanol and sterilized by filtration. These inducers were
added on the 3rd of the fermentation.
Effect of various concentration of copper sulphate on laccase production
Various concentrations of copper sulphate were analyzed to enhance the laccase production. The following
concentrations such 0.25mM, 0.5mM, 0.75 mM, 1mM, 1.5 mM, 1.75 mM, and2 mM were added on 3rd day of
thefermentation . The flask without the addition of copper sulphate was maintained  as control.
Effect various concentrations of 2, 5 xylidine
To optimize the suitable concentration of 2, 5 xylidine on laccase production by T. hirsute  was perfo rmed. The
concentrations such as 0.25 mM, 0.5 mM, 0.75 mM, 1mM, 1.5 mM, 1.75  mM and 2 mM were added on third
day of fermentation. The flask without 2,5 xylidine was maintained as control.
Statistical method
The traditional method viz, one factor at a tim e method was used to screen the effect of media components such
as, carbon, nitrogen and inducers respectively,  nevertheless it misses to examine the interaction among the
media components. Thestatistical tool Plakett-Burmanndesing (PB) designwas adapt ed to screen the essential
mediacomponents  as well as toimprove the laccase production
Analytical Determinations
Laccase activity
Laccase activity was determined using 2, 2 -azinobis (3 -ethylbenzothiazoline -6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) as
substrate at room tem perature. The reaction mixture contained 5 mM ABTS, 0.1M sodium acetate buffer (pH.5)
and 0.17 ml of  supernant was measured through rise of absorbance at 420nm ( ε= 36000M −1 cm−1). One unit
of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to oxidize 1  micro mole  of ABTS per minute.
The laccase activities were expressed in U/L.  Heat inactiv ated enzyme employed as control27.Bakkiyaraj S. et al/Int.J.ChemTech Res.2013,5( 3) 1227
Biomass determination
Thebiomass measurement  was determined by dry weight of fungal mycelium. The culture broth was filtered
usingWhatman No. 1 filter paper . The biomass retained was washed with distilled water and dried at 100◦C to a
constant weight.
Result and discussion:
Timecourse of laccase production
 Many of the wood degrading white rot fungi of basidiomycetes are found to be the  excellent producers of
laccase28,29.But variations prevailed in relation to optimum expression period of this enzyme among the
organisms. In th e present sutdy the time of secretion of laccase by the white rot fungus T. hirsuta  was evaluated
using the glucose, yeast extract basal media. From the period of inoculation within 4 to5days it reaches the
maximum cell mass concentration  withvery low  laccase activity. Incontrast most of the white rot fungi
produces laccase with respect to increase in mycelia growth in a gradual manner and attains maximum
productivity while the growth reaches the stationary phase30. The morphology of cell was observed th atpellet,
denses well as small insize.In addition there is a color change was identified  (orange color), due  to the
secretion of pigment.Pigment synthesis one ofbiological functions of some white rot  fungi. Maxima of laccase
production was attained during the stationary phase ontwentiethday of the fermentation with laccase activity of
7614 U/L  with cell mass of 263.6g/l. Figure.1  illustrates the laccase production i n relation to cell mass
concentrations. After twentieth day of fermentation a reduction  in the production of laccase was observed. In
addition the broth was changed as watery and decrease in the cell mass was also observed. This might be due to
the digestion of cell pellets by autolysis caused by the protealytic enzymes in the native cell.
Figure.1 shows the time course of laccase production byT. hirsita with respect to cell mass concentrations
Time course of copper sulphate addition
Apart from the addition of inducers, laccase production can also be increased by the supplementation of
sufficient concentration of copper sulphate to the culture medium. Copper sulphate is not inducer, a
micronutrient but has the potential to raise the laccase production considerably. Nevertheless its addition period
contributes important role in stimulati on of laccase production. Addition of copper sulphate concentrations such
as 0.1 –2 mM after 8 day of fermentation with complete consumption of glucose in the medium by the organism
Trametes pubescens MB 89intensely failed to produce higher laccase activit y.The effect ofcopper sulphate
addition with respect to time has frequently been demonstrated for different white rot fungi. The concentration,
1mM copper sulphate was found as the optimum concentration based on the induction of laccase activity. In
order to examine the exact time period of copper sulphate accommodation for laccase induction was studied by
adding the copper sulphate from the periodof inoculation to 5th day of the fermentation. Gradual increment inBakkiyaraj S. et al/Int.J.ChemTech Res.2013,5( 3) 1228
laccase production was identified up to third day of fermentation , followed by a laccase production decreased
slowly. Suppression of cell growth was found at during inoculation, first and sec ond day of the process. In
Trametes pubescens MB 89addition of low concentration of copper sulphate (0.1 –1 mM), during inoculation no
growth inhibition was observed, while higher concentrations of copper sulphate (1.5 –2 mM) partially repressed
the growth6. Figure.2 illustrates the time course of copper sulphate addition for laccase pr oduction by T.hirsuta.
Figure.2 depicts the time course of copper sulphate addition on laccase production by T. hirsuta .
Effect of various concentration of copper sulphate  on laccase production
An economical way  to increase laccase production  addition of copper sulphate to the culture medium  and has
widely been performed by different authors for different organism s to enhance the laccase production.  In some
white rot fungi viz P. chrysosporium ME44631, T. pubescens6andP.ostreatus32additionof copper  increases
laccase production .The different concentration tested were 0.25 mM, 0.5mM, 0.75 mM, 1 mM, 1.5 mM, 1.75
mM, and 2 mM. Among the various concentrations tested 1mM copper sulphate produced maximum laccase
activity of 17074 U/L. Growth as well as laccase production was suppre ssed due to addition of concentrations
above 1mM. It has been corroborated that addition of above1.5 mM concentration of copper sulphate to the
cultures of Lentinula edodes has inhibited the total growth33.Figure.3 depicts the effect various concentration s
of copper sulphate on laccase production by T. Hirsuta . Low production of laccase activity around 4236 U/L
was monitored from the control flask cultivated withoutcopper sulphate.
Figure.3 indicates the influence different copper sulphate concentratio n on laccase production by T.

Time course of 2, 5 xylidine addition
To investigate the time at which the incorporation of 2 , 5 xylidine influences the laccase production was
examined. There are plenty of inducers recommended for  laccase inductio nespecially aromatic inducers have
been widely used to enhance the laccase production. However their supplementation into the production
medium in accurate period plays important role. It has been elaborately studied that laccase production has been
governed by inducers with respect to the time of addition and appropriate concentration to the culture medium.
To enhance the laccase production in Trametes pubescens MB 89the aromatic inducer 2 , 5xylidinewith
concentration of 1mM was added on fourth day ofthe fermentation led to laccase activity of 8.6 U/ml6.The
optimum concentration of 1mM xylidine was supplemented every 24 hours including the time of inoculation.
Laccase production was gradually increased from the day of supplementation to third day of f ermentation with
high laccase titer of 23543U/l. followed by the production decreased gradually on 4th and 5th day of the process.
Inhibition in cell growth was found in during inoculation, first day and second day respectively compared to the
control cul ture. Figure.4 shows the deviation in laccase production by T. hirsuta  using2, 5 xylidine addition in
terms of days.
Figure.4 shows the deviation in laccase production by T. hirsuta 2, 5 xylidine addition in terms of days .
Effect of various 2, 5 xyli dine concentrations on laccase production
Though the addition of aromatic inducers has the ability to increase the laccase production, unless find the
impact of optimum concentration on laccase production is not a successful one. Several concentrations of 2,5
xylidine such as 0.25 mM, 0.5 mM, 0.75 mM, 1 mM, 1.5 mM, 1.75 mM, and 2 mM were analyzed in order to
find the impact of the relevant concentration on laccase production.  InP. cinnabarinus  0.1 mM 2, 5 -xylidine
has been foun d to be a good laccase induc er34. The laccase production was slowly increased by the
concentrations 0.25 mM-1mM. Maxima of laccase production were expressed from the concentration of 1mM
2, 5 xylidine  with laccase activity of 23543 U/L. Many reports have been reported in relation to the effect
appropriate concentration of 2, 5 xylidine on laccase production by white rot fungi. The higher concentrations
1.5- 2mM caused gradual reduction in laccase production. Incorporation of higher concentration of 2, 5
xylidine reduces laccase produ ction, it may be du e to toxicity of the compound34. Figure.5 depicts the various 2,
5 xylidine concentrations on laccase production by T.Hirsuta.Bakkiyaraj S. et al/Int.J.ChemTech Res.2013,5( 3) 1230
Figure.5 depicts the various 2, 5 xylidine concentrations on laccase production by T.Hirsuta.
Effect of lig nocellulosic material on laccase production
In general laccase production was achieved either limited carbon and nitrogen ratio or higher carbon and
nitrogen ratio in the cultivation medium. Also laccase production was successfully performed in a carbon an d
nitrogen sufficient medium. Different lignocellulosic materials viz, rice bran, wheat bran, elephant grass, waste
paper, orange peeling, lemon peeling, water hyacinth, baggase  respectively.  Of all tested lignocellulosic
substrates wheat bran  showed maxim um laccase activity of 9300 U/L followed by  lemon peeling  (8512 U/L)
andbagasse(6543 U/L)showed maximum activity .Wheat bran a byproduct received from the milling industry
of wheat and constituted by 58% nonstarch polysaccharides, 3% lignin, 19% starch a nd 18% crude protein. The
nonstarch part composed by 70% α-arabinoxylans, 24% cellulose and 6% β -(1,3)1,4-glucan respectively35.
Figure.6 depicts the effect of laccase production by T.hirsuta using various lignocellulosic materials.
Figure.6 depic ts the effect of laccase production by T.hirsuta  using various lignocellulosic materials.
In the past decades the various agricultural substrates and by -products have widely been exploited for laccase
production via white rot fungi under submerge and soli d state cultivation. More over the nature of
lignocellulosic substrate determine  the type and amount of enzym e formation during the process.36, 37, 38.Plenty
of data are reported in relation to laccase production by white rot fungi using lignocellulosic m aterial so fa r. ForBakkiyaraj S. et al/Int.J.ChemTech Res.2013,5( 3) 1231
instance, mandarin peels.39, grape seeds40,Eucalyptus grandis wood chips41respectively. In addition the
influence of mixed lignocellulosic substrates  and mixed lignocellulosic substrates  in combination with glucose
was studied for lacca se production. From the experimental results of screening of the best lignocellulosic
residue indicated that wheat bran, baggase and lime peeling showed appreciable laccase activity. Table.1 shows
theeffect lignocellulosic materials on laccase production byT. hirsute. Three combination s were made to
explore the interaction between the two agricultural residue such as WB +OP,  WB +BAG, WB +LP and these
three combination s were further examined with  glucose for laccase production viz,WB+OP+GLU, WB +
BAG+GLU, WB +LP+GLU respectively. All threecombinations  ofmixed lignocellulosic substrates tested
for increasing laccase production showed, moderate  laccaseactivityof7032 U/L,  6624 U/L and 4917 U/L .On
the other hand  mixed lignocellulosic residue with glucosecombination gave low production (917 U/L, 331U/L,
586 U/L). It is noteworthy that all these six interactions failed to produce high laccase activity than the better
laccase yield giving agro residue wheat bran. This might have happened due to th e accumulation of higher
glucose concentration liberated from lignocellulosic substrate to the medium. Control flask whichwas cultivated
with glucose alone gave a laccase activity of7614 U/L.
Table.1 shows the effect of different lignocellulosic materia ls on laccase production by T. hirsuta
Table.1-
Effect nitrogen source on laccase production
One of the important and easiest way  to increase laccase production is to screen the best nitrogen source with
appropriate concentration. Ligninolytic enzyme production s by the wood -rotting basidiomycetes have  been
influenced by the both nature and concentration of nitrogen sources and they are the important factors for
regulation of ligninolytic enzyme production and this has formerly been demonstrated.42,43,44. According to one
factor at a time method the dom inant nitrogen source was screened using wheat bran as the carbon source with
concentration of 20g/l. The effect of single and combined nitrogen source on laccase production by T.hirsuta
was studied. The ni trogensource such as y eastextract,urea,peptone,L-Aspargine, ammonium sulphate, malt
extract and ammonium tartarate were examined with concentration of 10 g/l and the combined nitrogen source
viz, ME +NHSO4, YE +Urea, YE +ME, ME +PEP, YE +NHSO 4, YE+TRY were assessed with
concentration of 5 g/l .Of allthe above tested nitrogen source peptone produced maximum laccase activity of
17390U/L, after that yeast extract and L -aspargine provided 7038 U/L and 8665 U/L respectively. Likewise the
mixed nitrogen sources viz, ME +NHSO4 and YE +ME gave somewhat average laccase production ( 12059
U/L, 10226 U/L). Very low laccase activity was detected from urea and ammonium sulphate around 16.66 U/L
and 1759 U/L was obtained in a single nitrogen mode performance, in addition , the cell growth of these cultures
were found to be suppressed . Figure.6 illustrates  the impact of single and mixed nitrogen source on laccase
production by T. hirsuta. It is well noted that nature of the nitrogen source affected laccase production inthiss.o Different lignocellulosic material Laccase (U/L)

fungus. Particularly theorganicnitrogen source viz, peptone and yeast extract gave maximum laccase activity
than the inorganic nitrogen source like Urea, ammonium sulphate. The inorganic  nitrogen sources urea and
ammonium sulphate have failed to produce high laccase titters when using t hem as a sole nitrogen source, but in
the combined form with malt extract, yeast extract viz, malt extract +NHSO4, yeast extract +Urea produced
greater laccase activity (12059, 965  U/L), conversely, it was already mentioned that yeast extract exhibited h igh
laccase activity when cultivated as sole nitrogen source. Figure.7 indicates  the effect different nitrogen source
on laccase production by T. Hirsuta. Likewise the organic nitrogen sources peptone and yeast extract produced
high laccase activity in a s ingle mode, but unable to produce large amount in the combined mode. Which clearly
indicates that thenature of the nitrogen source  strongly influence the laccase production by T.hirsuta. Table
indicates the effect of single and mixed nitrogen source on la ccase production by T. hirsuta.
Figure.7 indicates the effect different nitrogen source on laccase production by T. Hirsuta.
Effect inducers on laccase production
In general extracellular laccase productions by white rot fungi are constitutively produc ed in small amounts in
the broth17,hence their expression can be enhanced by the addition of different inducers viz aromatic or
phenoilic compounds related to lignin or lignin derivatives .45.There are  plenty of studies have been focused on
the type, conce ntration, and the feeding time of inducers on laccase production  so far5, 46.Several aromatic
inducers were explored in order to stimulate the laccase production such as 2,5 xylidine, guaiacol, catcechol,
veratryl alcohol, hydroxybenzotryazole (HBT), p -anisidine, 2,6 dimethoxy phenol (DMP), vanilic acid, ferulic
acid, gallic acid respectively . All these inducers were prepared with 5% ethanol, and sterilized by filtration.
They are added into the medium in the range of 1mM concentration on third day of the f ermentation. The
inducers assessed for laccase induction by this fungus displays different observation in regarding to cell growth
and laccase production. Based on the study conducted for time course of addition of inducers suggested  the
optimum time perio d toadd the inducers in the medium. Accordingly all the inducers were incorporated on third
day of the fermentation in orderto avoid the repression of cellgrowth as well as to acclimatize the environment
by theorganism in relation to laccase production . This fungus produced substantial laccase activity with all
inducers according to their nature of structure. Among the inducers verified for laccase induction by T.Hirsuta ,
2, 5xylidine gave maximum laccase activity of 23456 U/L also it was detected that cell mass formation was
high. Incontrast, growth inhibi tion as well as small laccase titre was obtaine d in p-anisidine and 1 -napthol.
After 2, 5 xylidine, better  laccase activity was observed from guaiacol ( 6847U/L), vanilic acid ( 6347U/L), 2, 6
dimethoxy phenol ( 5447 U/L),ferulic acid ( 4598 U/L)andGallic acid(4048 U/L). On the contrary the other
inducers revealed no appreciable inducement in laccase production than the control culture viz, p-anisidine
(2499 U/L) , 1-Napthol, (2948 U/L ),hydroxybenzotr yazole (HBT)  (2898 U/L) , veratryl alcohol (VA) (3798
U/L). Figure.8 depict the effect of different aromatic inducers on laccase production by T. Hirsuta . The findings
of our study coincided with previous results that  The white rot fungus Coriolus versicolor MTCC 138 has
produced of 820 U/ml with theinducing effect by 1mM of copper sulphate and 2,5 -xylidine47. One of the mostBakkiyaraj S. et al/Int.J.ChemTech Res.2013,5( 3) 1233
common and most frequently used inducer for laccase production by diverse fungal strains is 2 , 5xylidine,

Plakett-burmann design
The system governed by multiple variables like biochemical process, where the number of effective variables
influencing the system should be examined before optimization using an initial screening design48,49.The
Plackett –Burman50experimental design was adapted to assess the relative importance different nutrien ts on
laccase production under submerge fermentation by  the white rot fungus T.hirsuta. This design presumes that
there are no interactions among the different media components, xi, in the range of variables under
consideration. A linear approach is consid ered to be sufficient for screening.
Y=β0+∑β i xi (i =1‚ · · · ‚k)
where Y is the estimated target function and β i are the regression coefficients. The PB design is a fractional
factorial design and the main effect (the contrast coefficient, b) of such a design may be simply computed as the
variations between the average of measurements made at the high level (+1) of the factor and the average of
measurements made at the low level ( -1) of the varibles used laccase production in terms of (g/l) as follows:
A(Wheat Bran) 10,20 , B (peptone) 5,10 ; C (MgSO 4) 5,10; D (KCl) 5, 10; E (KH 2PO4) 0.1, 0.5; F (K 2HPO4) 0.1

Conclusion
The white rot fungus Trametes hirsutawas examined to find its capability of laccase production under
submerge d fermentation. The time period of appearance of laccase by the organism was observed on 20th day of
the process with maximum laccase activity of 7614 U/L. Similarly the optimum conce ntration of copper
sulphate and  2, 5 xylidine were optimized . According t o one factor at a time -method the effect the primary
process constituent s viz carbon as agro industry waste, nitrogen and inducers on laccase production were
performed. The lignocellulosic material wheat bran gave maximum laccase activity of 9300 U/L.Thecombined
action of both wheat  bran and peptone with supplementation of 1mM copper sulphate induced the laccase
activity of 17390 U/L . production of laccase was further stimulated to 23543U/L by 1mM 2 , 5 xylidine
incorporation. With the use of statistical m ethod viz, P lakett- Burmann design enhanced laccase production to
25889 U/L and the influence of significant media components were screened.Bakkiyaraj S. et al/Int.J.ChemTech Res.2013,5( 3) 1236
