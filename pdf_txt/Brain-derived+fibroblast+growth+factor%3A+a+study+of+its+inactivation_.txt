Acidic (aFGF) and basic (bFGF) fibroblast growth factors are 
well-characterized peptide hormones that have potent an- 
giogenic activity and that are mitogenic for a variety of cell 
types. The present findings demonstrate that FGFs can re- 
produce the entire spectrum of rat pheochromocytoma PC1 2 
cell responses previously shown to be elicited by NGF. These 
include responses that are rapid (cell flattening, enhanced 
phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase) or delayed (neurite 
outgrowth, induction of phosphorylated MAPl.2, regulation 
of NILE and Thy-l glycoproteins, cessation of mitosis, ele- 
vation of AChE activity), as well as responses that have been 
shown to be either transcription-independent (neurite re- 
generation, promotion of survival) or transcription-depen- 
dent (priming, regulation of NILE and Thy-l glycoproteins, 
elevation of AChE activity). The only responses for which 
the FGFs and NGF consistently showed quantitative differ- 
ences were in the rates for neurite initiation and elongation 
in serum-containing medium. Thus, while all 3 factors pro- 
moted the formation of stable neurites, the network of out- 
growth elicited by NGF at any given time of treatment was 
always of greater density. Togari et al. (1985) have previ- 
ously reported that bFGF can initiate transient neurite for- 
mation in PC1 2 cell cultures. The present observations de- 
scribe a variety of additional actions of bFGF on a neuronal 
cell line, and demonstrate that aFGF is capable of mimicking 
many, if not all, of these actions. These observations thus 
extend the range of actions that aFGF and bFGF may po- 
tentially exert on nerve cells, either during their develop- 
ment, repair, or maintenance. In addition, this work suggests 
that the PC1 2 cell line may serve as a useful model system 
with which to study the mechanism of action of FGFs on 
neurons. Since all 3 factors appear capable of eliciting the 
same wide spectrum of responses, molecular events spe- 
cifically associated with FGFs and NGF in PC12 cells may 
prove illuminating of the causal steps involved in neuronal 
differentiation.

Copyright 0 1987 Society for Neuroscience 0270-6474/87/l 13639-15302.00/O Cell-cell interactions profoundly influence the survival and dif- 
ferentiation of the developing nervous system. Trophic mole- 
cules represent an attractive mechanism for mediating influ- 
ences ofthis type (reviewed in Berg, 1984). A role for neurotrophic 
molecules during development is most clearly demonstrated by 
the example of the peptide hormone NGF, which plays a critical 
role in the development of the sympathetic and sensory nervous 
systems (for reviews, see Greene and Shooter, 1980; Vinores 
and Guroff, 1980; Yankner and Shooter, 1982) and which also 
appears to affect certain CNS neurons (reviewed in Korsching, 
1986). NGF’s primary actions on target cells, including main- 
tenance of survival, induction of neurite outgrowth, and alter- 
ations in the metabolism of neurotransmitters, are reproducible 
in vitro, thus allowing questions of neuronal development to be 
addressed by cell culture techniques. One target of NGF, the 
rat PC 12 pheochromocytoma cell line, has proved to be useful 
for studying NGF’s mechanism of action (Greene and Tischler, 
1982). PC 12 cells resemble adrenal medullary chromaffin cells, 
but when exposed to NGF for several days, they cease cell 
division and undergo conversion to a sympathetic neuron-like 
phenotype (Greene and Tischler, 1976). Both transcription-in- 
dependent and transcription-dependent pathways appear to be 
involved in the NGF-induced neuronal differentiation of PC 12 
cells (reviewed in Greene, 1984), though current knowledge of 
the molecular events orchestrating this neuronal conversion is 
still limited. 
In order to more fully understand the molecular events un- 
derlying NGF-induced neuronal differentiation, we have begun 
to test various agents for their capacities to mimic some, or all, 
of NGF’s responses in PC 12 cells. This approach should allow 
the identification of molecular events associated with particular 
responses in PC1 2 cells and, therefore, permit more precise 
dissection of the various pathways that comprise the NGF re- 
sponse. Furthermore, agents found to mimic most, if not all, of 
NGF’s actions on PC 12 cells should be potentially strong can- 
didates for a neurotrophic role in nervous system development. 
Among the potentially interesting agents to be tested in the 
PC 12 cell system are the fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). Acidic 
FGF (aFGF) and basic FGF (bFGF) are well-characterized pep- 
tide hormones that have potent angiogenic activity and are 
mitogenic for a variety of cell types (for reviews, see Gospo- 
darowicz et al., 1986; Lobb et al., 1986; Thomas and Gimenez- 
Gallego, 1986). aFGF shares a 55% sequence homology with 
bFGF (Esch et al., 1985b; Gimenez-Gallego et al., 1985), and 
both forms appear to promote their biological effects via inter- 
action with the same specific cell-surface receptor sites (Neufeld 
and Gospodarowicz, 1986). Walicke et al. (1986) and Morrison 
et al. (1986) have recently reported that bFGF enhances both 3640 Rydel and Greene - FGF-Induced Neuronal Differentiation of PC1 2 Cells 
the survival and extent of neurite outgrowth in cultures of dis- 
sociated hippocampal neurons and cerebral cortical neurons, 
respectively. This, coupled with the finding that neural tissue is 
a rich source of both aFGF (Lobb and Fett, 1984; Thomas et 
al., 1984) and bFGF (Gospodarowicz et al., 1984), raises the 
possibility that FGFs may play a role in normal nervous system 
development or function. 
Of particular relevance and interest here are the reports of 
Togari et al. (1983, 1985) that bFGF can mimic some, but not 
all, of NGF’s actions on PC 12 cells. Basic FGF was reported to 
induce transient process outgrowth and omithine decarboxylase 
activity, but, in contrast to NGF, did not increase AChE activity 
and was unable to promote “priming” (discussed below) in PC 12 
cell cultures. On this basis, it was suggested that bFGF may 
have effects on PC 12 cells similar to those promoted by perme- 
ant analogs of CAMP. Such analogs mimic some of the early 
responses of PC 12 cells to NGF, but do not mimic most of the 
delayed, transcription-dependent actions of this growth factor 
(reviewed in Greene and Shooter, 1980). 
In this study, we tested both aFGF and bFGF for their ability 
to promote both early and delayed responses of PC 12 cells, and 
compared their responses with those elicited by NGF. The fol- 
lowing responses were examined: cell morphology and neurite 
outgrowth, priming, survival and neurite outgrowth in serum- 
free medium, cell division rate, short- and long-term effects on 
specific phosphoproteins, synthesis of specific glycoproteins, and 
AChE activity. These included transcription-independent and 
transcription-dependent responses, ranging in appearance from 
minutes to days. We report that aFGF and bFGF mimic all 
NGF responses tested in PC12 cells. Both aFGF and bFGF 
produced stable neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation 
in PC 12 cell cultures. These findings support a neurotrophic role 
for FGFs in nervous system development and indicate that 
PC 12 cells may serve as a model system to study the mechanism 
of this action of FGFs. 
Some of the results reported here have previously appeared 
in abstract form (Rydel and Greene, 1985). 
Materials and Methods 
Cell culture methods. PC 12 cells were cultured as previously described 
(Greene and Tischler, 1976). For most experiments, cells were me- 
chanically dislodged for passaging by forceful aspiration of medium 
through a Pasteur pipette and plated into 35 mm collagen-coated tissue 
culture dishes containing a total of 1.5 ml of complete medium. For 
determination of survival in serum-free medium, cultures of PC1 2 cells 
were washed 3 times with serum-free medium [Roswell Park Memorial 
Institute Medium 1640 (RPM1 1640) containing antibiotics but no ad- 
ditional additives] and then maintained with se-rum-free medium con- 
taining either FGF or NGF. All cultures were maintained in an atmo- 
sphereof 93% air, 7% CO, at 37°C. The medium of stock cultures was 
exchanged 3 times/week, while experimental cultures, unless otherwise 
specified, were treated every other day. 
Measurements of cellular responses to FGFs and NGF. Cell counts 
were determined by removing the culture medium and dissolving the 
cells in a detergent lysing solution, as described by Soto and Sonnen- 
schein (1985) and then counting the nuclei using a hemacytometer. For 
each treatment, at least 1000 cells were counted. The proportion of 
neurite-bearing cells was determined by counting the number of cells 
containing processes at least twice the length of the cell body (i.e., 220 
pm in length). For each treatment, at least 300 randomly selected cells 
were scored. Neurite lengths were determined by the use of an eyepiece 
micrometer. At least 30-50 random neurites were measured for each 
treatment; lengths are reported as means * SEM. 
Cultures used for isolation of Triton X- 1 OO-soluble phosphoproteins 
were plated at a density of 1 x lo5 cells/cm2. Prior to labeling, each 
culture was washed 3 times with 2 ml RPM1 1640 (without added serum) and maintained under these conditions for 12 hr. This procedure greatly 
eliminated background, serum-induced phosphorylations without com- 
promisina PC12 cell viabilitv. Labeling with 3ZP-orthophosnhate was 
performed as described by Skeley et a< (1984). At the-end-of the in- 
cubation, cultures were rinsed twice with PBS, extracted for 10 min 
with a microtubule-stabilizing buffer, modified from Solomon et al. 
(1979) containingO.l% Triton X-100 (10 mM imidazole, pH 7.2-7.35, 
1 mM MgCl,, 75 mM KCl, 50 mM NaF, 2 M glycerol, 1 mM EGTA, 
0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 kal- 
likrein-inhibition U/ml aprotinin). To 800 ~1 of the solubilized proteins 
in the Triton/glycerol extract was added 267 ~1 of 4x sample buffer 
(Laemmli, 1970). Samples were incubated in a boiling-water bath for 
5 min. Proteins were subsequently resolved on 32 cm, 5-10% linear 
gradient SDS polyacrylamide gels, using the protocol of Greene et al. 
(1983). The gels were dried and autoradiograms were prepared using 
Kodak XAR-5 x-ray film. Quantification was carried out over an ap- 
proximately linear range of film density using a Hoefer Scientific GS 
300 scanning densitometer, and individual peaks integrated to deter- 
mine relative peak areas using the SCANGEL program, written by S. A. 
Drexler (Department of Pharmacology, New York University School 
of Medicine). 
Previously published procedures were used for all of the remaining 
analyses performed in this study. ‘2P-orthophosphate-labeled proteins 
from cultures treated for 13 d with either bFGF or NGF in the presence 
of 1% horse serum or PC 12 cell-conditioned medium (see below) were 
resolved by methods described in Greene et al. (1983), except that gel 
electrophoresis was performed using gels containing 4 M urea and 3.2% 
polyacrylamide, or 32 cm, 7.5-l 5% linear gradient gels. 3H-fucose-la- 
beled proteins were identified by methods described in Richter-Lands- 
berg et al. (1985). AChE activity and protein determinations were mea- 
sured as described in Greene and Rukenstein (198 1) and are reported 
as means + SD. 
Materials. Mouse 2.5 S NGF was prepared from adult male sub- 
mandibular glands according to the method of Mobley et al. (1976). 
NGF concentration was determined spectrophotometrically, assuming 
A,$8P, = 1.6, and activity was assessed by means ofa quantitative bioassay 
(Greene, 1977). NGF was estimated to be greater than 99% pure, based 
on silver-stained, SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoretic gels. When em- 
ployed, NGF was used at a saturating concentration of 50 @ml. Acidic 
and basic FGFs, prepared from bovine brain (Bohlen et al., 1985) and 
pituitary (Gospodarowicz et al., 1984) respectively, were generously 
supplied by Dr. D. Gospodarowicz (Cancer Research Institute, Uni- 
versity of California Medical Center. San Francisco). The homoaeneitv 
of each was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, amino acid compositi& and 
amino-terminus sequencing. Human basic FGF was generously supplied 
by Drs. D. B. Ritkin and D. M. Moscatelli (Department of Cell Biology, 
New York University Medical Center) and was isolated from term 
human placenta by a modification of a procedure described previously 
(Moscatelli et al., 1986). After elution from heparin-Sepharose, the 
active fractions were dialyzed against 0.2 M NaCI, 20 mM 2-(N-mor- 
pholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), pH 6.0, clarified by centrifugation 
at 100,000 x g for 60 min, and loaded onto a FPLC-Mono S column 
(Pharmacia) equilibrated with the same buffer. Basic FGF was eluted 
with a gradient of 0.2-0.7 M NaCl in 20 mM MES, pH 6.0, and silver- 
stained as a single band (Mr z 18.7 kDa) under both reducing and 
nonreducina conditions after SDS-PAGE. Its identitv was based upon 
its affinity ior heparin-Sepharose, cross-reactivity with antibodies to 
basic FGF (Moscatelli et al., 1986), and amino acid sequence data 
(Sommer et al., 1987). Antiserum to NGF was prepared in a rabbit, as 
described by Zanini et al. (1968), and was generously supplied by Drs. 
C. Keith and M. Shelanski (Department of Pharmacology, New-York 
University Medical Center): it was used at a dilution ( 1: 100) that fullv 
blocked the neurite outgrowth-promoting effects of 5d t&ml NGF on 
PC1 2 cell cultures. 
PC 12 cell-conditioned medium (CM) was obtained from high-density 
(- lo6 cells/cm*) cultures of untreated PC1 2 cells. Medium obtained in 
the process of feeding stock cultures was pooled and filtered through a 
0.45 pm filter to remove particulate matter, then frozen at -20°C for 
later use. CM was mixed with fresh complete medium before use to 
obtain a final concentration of 70% CM. CM alone produced no de- 
monstrable effects on PC 12 cells. 
Actinomycin D (Sigma) was diluted into medium from a stock so- 
lution (400 PM) dissolved in 50% propylene glycol; the carrier alone, 
when added to control cultures, had no demonstrable effects. The so- 
dium salt of heparin (Sigma) was diluted into medium from a stock The Journal of Neuroscience, November 1997, 7(11)

Results 
Morphology and neurite outgrowth 
Basic FGF. The morphological responses of PC1 2 cells to treat- 
ment with bFGF are almost qualitatively identical to those seen 
with NGF. Both bFGF and NGF induce cell flattening and the 
production of short, cytoplasmic extensions (spiking) within 
minutes to hours following their addition to cultures. Neurites 
are first detectable with either treatment after a lag period of 
about 1 d, and continue to appear over a time course of many 
days (Figs. 1, A, B, E, F, 2). Such neurites are easily distin- 
guishable from cytoplasmic spikes in that they possess branches 
and flattened growth-cone-like structures, and elongate beyond 
2 cell body diameters. Togari et al. (1985) have previously shown 
that bFGF elicits neurite formation by PC 12 cells, but reported 
that the processes that formed were relatively short and retracted 
within 3-6 d of treatment. We have followed cultures of PC12 
cells treated with bFGF for up to 30 d and found no evidence 
of deterioration or retraction of neuritic processes. These stable i 4 s

neurites may reach lengths of several hundred micrometers (cf. 
Fig. 1, E, G). Furthermore, anti-NGF antiserum had no effect 
on FGF-induced outgrowth (data not shown). 
Initiation of neurite outgrowth was tested at bovine bFGF 
concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 135 @ml, with maximal 
outgrowth occurring at 5-l 5 rig/ml (300-900 PM). Cell flattening 
and spiking were evident at all concentrations used, though, by 
visual inspection, neurite outgrowth was greatly diminished or 
absent at doses of less than 1 rig/ml or greater than 100 r&ml. 
Additional studies (see below) on both bovine bFGF-induced 
neurite regeneration from primed PC12 cells and survival of 
PC 12 cells in serum-free medium resulted in similar dose-re- 
sponse relationships. 
The source of bFGF does not appear to alter the response of 
PC 12 cells. Human placental bFGF produces stable neurite out- 
growth identical to that produced by bovine pituitary bFGF 
(Fig. 1 G). However, the potency of human bFGF differed from 
that of bovine bFGF. Dose-response experiments (0.6-l 50 ng/ 
ml) revealed some effect of human bFGF on neurite formation 
at 5 &ml (300 PM), while maximal neurite outgrowth occurred 
at 50 r&ml (3 nM; Fig. 1 G) and above. Human bFGF-induced

DAYS OF TREATMENT 
PC 12 cells in serum-free medium (see below) also follow a sim- 
ilar dose-response relationship. Recent protein sequencing of 
the human bFGF used in this study (Sommer et al., 1987) has 
determined that it possesses an 11 -amino acid extension at the 
amino terminus that is not present in the bovine bFGF we 
employed (Esch et al., 1985a), and 2 amino acid substitutions 
relative to bovine bFGF. These differences in protein structure 
between human and bovine bFGF may account for the differ- 
ences in their relative potencies. 
One difference found between NGF and bFGF is that bFGF 
addition in serum-containing medium always resulted in a neu- 
ritic network of lesser density than that produced by comparable 
NGF treatment. This difference in the density of neurites was 
first evident after 2 d of treatment, and was clearly obvious after 
6 d of treatment (Fig. 1, A, B). In addition, analyses of the rates 
for neurite initiation and neurite elongation revealed that both 
are less with bFGF as compared to NGF treatment (Fig. 2). At 
every time point tested, PC 12 cultures treated with bFGF dis- 
played fewer cells possessing neurites than did cultures treated 
with NGF (Fig. 2, upper panel). Neurite elongation after bFGF 
addition followed a near-linear mean rate of 18 Mm/d (R = 0.98), 
as compared to a near-linear mean rate of 43 pm/d (R = 0.99) 
with NGF treatment (Fig. 2, lower panel). The latter value is in 
close agreement with a mean elongation rate of 42 Mm/d pre- 
viously reported for NGF treatment of PC12 cells (Greene et 
al., 1982). One possible explanation for these differences be- 
tween bFGF and NGF could be a reduced stability or more 
rapid degradation of bFGF in the culture medium; bFGF has 
an in vitro half-life of -24 hr at 37°C (Westall et al., 1983). 
However, treatment of PC12 cells with human bFGF every 12 
hr instead of every 2 d over a period of 1 week did not alter 
the pattern or density of neurite outgrowth (data not shown). 
Our initial experiments were performed with cells at a low 
density of 1 x lo4 cells/cm2. In these cultures, not only were 
the lengths and density of neurites produced in the presence of 
bFGF diminished as compared to those generated in the pres- 
ence of NGF, but there was also a considerable difference in the 
proportion of cells that displayed neurites, even after 12 d of 
treatment (Fig. 3). Under these conditions, about 70% of PC1 2 
cells possessed neurites after l-2 weeks of NGF treatment, yet Figure 3. Effect of conditioned me- 
dium on the rate of neurite initiation 
by PC1 2 cells in the presence of bFGF 
or NGF. Cultures of PC 12 cells (1 OV 
cm*) were scored at various times for 
the percentage of net&e-bearing cells 
in the presence of complete growth me- 
dium (solid lines) or conditioned me- 
dium (dashed lines) and either 50 ng/ 
ml NGF (0) or 5 @ml bovine bFGF 
(x). For each treatment, at least 300 
random cells were scored. 
bFGF treatment for 12 d resulted in neurite formation by only 
50% of the cells. Increasing the cell density 5-fold (from 1 x 
1 O4 to 5 x 1 O4 cells/cm2) significantly augmented the percentage 
of cells possessing neurites after 12 d of treatment with either 
bFGF (50% to >95%) or NGF (71% to >95%). 
These effects of increased cell density could be mimicked with 
medium conditioned by high-density cultures ofNGF-untreated 
PC12 cells (CM). This material was found to significantly po- 
tentiate the formation of neurites elicited by either bFGF or 
NGF in low-density cultures (compare Fig. 1, A, B with C, D; 
Fig. 3). The use of CM with these low-density cultures resulted 
in > 80% of the cells generating neurites after 12 d of exposure 
to bFGF (Fig. 3). Treatment with CM alone, without added 
growth factors, produced no changes in cell morphology (data 
not shown). The above findings indicate that all, or nearly all, 
PC 12 cells are capable of responding to bFGF. Furthermore, as 
shown in Figure 3, serum and conditioning factors appear to 
more greatly potentiate the effects of NGF on neurite formation 
than they do for the effects of bFGF treatment. 
Acidic FGF. Bovine aFGF was also tested for its effects on 
PC12 cell morphology. Treatment of PC12 cell cultures with 
aFGF at concentrations of up to 50-l 50 rig/ml (3-9 nM) resulted 
mainly in cell flattening and spiking, with minimal neurite out- 
growth after 1 week of exposure (Fig. 4B). This is consistent 
with the finding (Bohlen et al., 1985; Esch et al., 1985a) that 
the mitogenic and angiogenic activities of aFGF are 30-100- 
fold less potent than those of bFGF. It has also been reported 
that aFGF binds to heparin, and that the presence of heparin 
appears to both stabilize the active conformation of aFGF and 
decrease the apparent Kd of binding to its receptor, thereby 
potentiating the effects of aFGF (Schreiber et al., 1985). Basic 
FGF also binds to heparin, but, in contrast, is not potentiated 
by this material (Lobb et al., 1986; Thomas and Gimenez-Gal- 
lego, 1986). In the present experiments, heparin was found to 
significantly affect the neurite-promoting activity of aFGF. Con- 
centrations of a FGF as low as 5 rig/ml (300 PM) resulted in 
significant neurite outgrowth when added in the presence of 50 
&ml heparin (Fig. 4A). As in the case of bFGF, these neurites 
were stable for at least several weeks. Also, as shown in Figure 
4, the presence of heparin neither potentiates nor inhibits the 3644 Rydel and Greene l FGF-Induced Neuronal Differentiation of PC12 Cells

alter the response of PC 12 cells to NGF (data not shown). 
Priming and neurite regeneration. The initiation of neurite 
outgrowth in PC12 cell cultures by NGF is a transcription- 
dependent event blocked by low concentrations of RNA-syn- 
thesis inhibitors. In contrast, NGF-dependent neurite regener- 
ation by PC 12 cells pretreated with the factor for l-2 weeks is 
not blocked even by high concentrations of such inhibitors (Bur- 
stein and Greene, 1978). The transcription-dependent events 
that PC12 cells undergo, which enable them to initiate neutite 
outgrowth and to exhibit transcription-independent neurite re- 
generation, have been termed “priming” (Burstein and Greene, 
1978). 
Basic FGF has previously been reported to promote neurite

the work of Togari et al. (1985), both bovine and human bFGF 
were found to promote neurite regeneration from NGF-primed 
PC 12 cells (Fig. 5). In each case, regeneration-promoting activity

scored per point. For each point, the 
data were normalized so that 100% 
neurite regeneration equals the propor- 
tion ofcell clumps regenerating neurites

was detectable in the low picomolar range. Maximal neurite 
regeneration was promoted at a bovine bFGF concentration of 
5 rig/ml (300 PM), while human bFGF had maximal effects at 
50 rig/ml (3 nM). Furthermore, as is the case with NGF, bFGF- 
induced regeneration of neurites is transcription-independent 
(Fig. 4E). Cultures of PC 12 cells were treated for 2 weeks with 
either bFGF or NGF divested of their processes by mechanical 
disruption, and subcultured in the presence of 10 PM actino- 
mycin D and one of the factors. At the concentration employed, 
actinomycin D blocks over 95% of uridine incorporation in 
PC 12 cultures (Burstein and Greene, 1978), but does not inhibit 
bFGF-induced neurite regeneration (Fig. 4). However, this rapid 
regeneration of neurites is consistently greater with NGF than 
with bFGF treatment (compare Fig. 4, E and F), as was pre- 
viously noted for the initiation of neurite outgrowth (Fig. 1, E, 
i-9. 
Additional studies revealed that bFGF is also capable of prim- 
ing PC1 2 cells. Figure 4, G, H, shows that both bFGF and NGF, 
respectively, can initiate rapid, transcription-independent re-

generation of neurites from bFGF-pretreated cells. However, 
the net&e-regeneration response of bFGF-primed cells to bFGF 
treatment was always much less robust in comparison to the 
other 3 conditions. Basic FGF- or NGF-primed cells subcul- 
tured in the absence of added growth factor did not display 
neuritic processes, nor did CM enhance bFGF- or NGF-induced 
neurite regeneration by primed cells (data not shown). 
Survival and morphological dlyerentiation in serum-free 
medium 
Under the previously described growth conditions (Greene and 
Tischler, 1976) in serum-containing medium (85% RPM1 1640, 
10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 
no NGF’), PC12 cells show excellent viability and growth. In 
contrast, PC1 2 cells are not viable in RPM1 1640 medium lack- 
ing serum. However, supplementation of serum-free medium 
with NGF promotes both PC 12 cell survival and neuronal dif- 
ferentiation (Greene, 1978). As shown in Figure 6, bovine bFGF can also maintain cell viability in serum-free cultures of PC12 
cells, and does so in a concentration-dependent manner. Op- 
timal survival was observed at a bovine bFGF concentration 
of 5 rig/ml (300 PM), with half-maximal effects at 300 pg/ml(20 
PM). These concentrations are in close agreement with the dose- 
response relationship observed for the mitogenic response of 
bovine bFGF on endothelial cells (Gospodarowicz et al., 1984; 
Thomas and Gimenez-Gallego, 1986). Furthermore, in this type 
of assay, bovine bFGF is about an order of magnitude more 
potent than NGF (Fig. 6). The data in Figure 6 also reveal that 
increasing the concentration of bovine bFGF above 5 rig/ml 
resulted in a loss of cell viability. Basic FGF-promoted survival 
of cerebral cortical neurons has also been reported to diminish 
with supraoptimal concentrations of bFGF (Morrison et al., 
1986). 
In agreement with its potency in promoting neurite initiation 
and regeneration (see above), human bFGF promoted optimal 
cell survival at 50 rig/ml (3 nM), with half-maximal effectiveness The Journal of Neuroscience, November 1987, 7(11) 3647 
at about 4-6 @ml (200-300 PM). Moscatelli et al. (1986) have 
reported that this preparation of bFGF promotes mitosis of 
bovine capillary endothelial cells, with a half-maximal concen- 
tration of 1 rig/ml (50 PM). 
In addition to preventing the death of PC 12 cells in serum- 
free medium, bFGF also induces their morphological differ- 
entiation. As shown in Figure 7, the response of PC12 cells to 
bFGF in serum-free medium appears to be quite similar to that 
with NGF. The density of neurite outgrowth of both NGF- and 
FGF-treated cells in serum-free medium (Fig. 7) always ap- 
peared similar to that of bFGF in serum-containing medium 
(Fig. 1A). Furthermore, as with NGF (Greene, 1978) the neu- 
rites of cells grown in serum-free medium with bFGF were finer 
and showed less fasciculation than did those grown in the pres- 
ence of serum. 
Cell division rate 
One of the responses of PC1 2 cells to NGF is cessation of 
replication (Greene and Tischler, 1976). The doubling time for 
PC12 cells in complete growth medium lacking either FGF or 
NGF is approximately 3 d (Greene and Tischler, 1976; Fig. 8). 
As shown in Figure 8, by 7 d of exposure to bFGF, the cell 
number per dish remains at a near-constant level. The absence 
of debris in the medium indicates that this is due to cessation 
of multiplication rather than to cell death. This effect of bFGF 
occurs with a time course identical to that observed with NGF 
treatment (Fig. 8). 
Rapid changes in protein phosphorylation 
Further experiments were performed to test whether, in addition 
to promotion of neurite outgrowth and maintenance of survival, 
FGF could also elicit biochemical responses in PC12 cultures 
similar to those brought about by NGF. One rapid, transcrip- 
tion-independent response of PC 12 cells to NGF is a change in 
the phosphorylation of specific cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins 
(Halegoua and Patrick, 1980; Yu et al., 1980). These changes 
involve both increases (Halegoua and Patrick, 1980; Yu et al., 
1980) and decreases (End et al., 1983) in the level of phospho- 
rylation of specific proteins. We therefore compared cytoplasmic 
(Triton X- 1 OO-soluble) proteins of PC 12 cells labeled during 2 
hr of exposure to 32P-orthophosphate with either bFGF, NGF, 
or an equal volume of RPM1 1640 added during the second 
hour of incubation. As shown in Figure 9, the general pattern 
of protein phosphorylation following exposure to either bFGF 
or NGF is quite similar. Compared to untreated controls, den- 
sitometric scans reveal that there was a significant increase (2.6- 
fold for the experiment shown) in the incorporation of 32P into 
a band with a M, = 60 kDa. This effect is shown more clearly 
by the lower gain scan on the right of Figure 9. All or most of 
the responsive 60 kDa band has been identified as being com- 
posed of tyrosine hydroxylase (Halegoua and Patrick, 1980; Lee 
et al., 1985). In addition, as previously reported by Togari et 
al. (1985) both NGF and bFGF led to an inhibition of the 
phosphorylation of a band with a M, = 100 kDa. 
Long-term changes in protein phosphorylation 
In addition to promoting rapid biochemical responses in PC1 2 
cells, NGF also elicits long-term, transcription-dependent 
changes. Among these is an induction in the level of a high- 
molecular-weight, microtubule-associated phosphoprotein des- 
ignated MAP1.2 (Greene et al., 1983; Drubin et al., 1985). This 
effect has been found to be independent of neurite outgrowth, 10-

To test the efficacy of FGFs in this regard, cultures of PC12 
cells were treated with either bFGF or NGF for 12-13 d and 
then exposed to ‘*P-orthophosphate for 2 hr. In some experi- 
ments, cultures were maintained in CM to allow for maximal 
neurite outgrowth. Figure 10, A and B, shows that a band at 
M, = 300 kDa was induced by over 15-fold in response to long- 
term treatment with either bFGF or NGF. This band has pre- 
viously been identified as MAP1.2 in long-term NGF-treated 
cultures of PC12 cells (Greene et al., 1983; Drubin et al., 1985; 
J. M. Aletta, N. Cowan, S. Lewis, and L. A. Greene, unpublished 
observations). A second band at M, = 130 kDa showed a major 
increase in labeling after long-term treatment with either bFGF 
or NGF, while a band at M, = 55 kDa showed a minor increase 
with either treatment. In addition, bands at M, = 40 kDa and 
34 kDa showed slight decreases in 3zP labeling following bFGF 
or NGF treatment. CM alone had no effect on the phosphoryl- 
ation pattern of PC 12 cells with either short- or long-term treat- 
ment, and was not required for bFGF induction of MAP1.2.

composition. These are an increase in a 25 kDa glycoprotein 
(McGuire et al., 1978), which has been identified as Thy-l and 
shown not to be increased following exposure to dbcAMP or 
epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Richter-Landsberg et al., 1985), 
and an increase in the 230 kDa NGF-inducible large external 
(NILE) glycoprotein (McGuire et al., 1978; Salton et al., 1983). 
Both of these glycoproteins can be easily distinguished from 
other species by SDS-PAGE. To compare bFGF to NGF with 
respect to their effects on PC12 cell glycoprotein composition, 
cultures were treated for 5 or 20 d with either factor. The cultures 
were metabolically labeled with 3H-fucose during the last 3 d 
of treatment, and their glycoproteins were analyzed by SDS- 
PAGE and fluorography. The relative level of NILE glycopro- 
tein labeling was detectably enhanced after 5 d of bFGF treat- 
ment, and increased 3%fold after 20 d (Fig. 11). The magnitude 
of these effects was comparable to that obtained with NGF in this (Fig. 11) and other experiments. Incorporation of 3H-fucose 
into Thy-l was also increased within 5 d with either bFGF or 
NGF treatment (Fig. 11, lanes A, B). This 2.4-fold increase in 
Thy-l glycoprotein appears to be due to changes in the level of 
transcription of the Thy-l gene, since Thy-l mRNA is also 
significantly increased after 3 d of exposure to bFGF (Drexler 
and Greene, 1986). 
The relative labeling of Thy-l glycoprotein often returns to 
control levels after NGF treatment for 10 d or longer (Richter- 
Landsberg et al., 1985) but occasionally remains elevated for 
longer periods. In the particular experiment shown in Figure 
11, the Thy- 1 labeling in the culture exposed to bFGF returned 
to near-control levels by day 20, while that in the NGF-treated 
culture did not. In other experiments (not shown) the level of 
Thy- 1 labeling in cultures treated with bFGF for over 10 d did 
not fall. The Journal of Neuroscience, November 1997, 7(11) 3649

AChE activity 
Figure 12 shows the relationship between FGF or NGF treat- 
ment and AChE-specific activity in cultures of PC1 2 cells. NGF 
has been demonstrated to induce an increase in AChE-specific 
activity in PC1 2 cultures (Lucas et al., 1980; Rieger et al., 1980). 
This effect has been shown to be transcription-dependent and 
neither mimicked nor altered by EGF, dexamethasone, or 
dbcAMP (Greene and Rukenstein, 1981). Togari et al. (1985) 
reported that bovine pituitary bFGF failed to affect AChE ac- 
tivity in PC1 2 cells after 3 d of treatment. In the present studies, 
human bFGF (50 &ml) was found to stimulate AChE-specific 
activity in PC 12 cell cultures to an extent similar to that of NGF 
after both 3 and 10 d of exposure. Moreover, when tested after 
10 d of exposure, this approximately 2-fold stimulation was 
mimicked by bovine bFGF (5 @ml). Bovine aFGF at 10 ng/ 
ml also brought about a similar increase, but, consistent with 
its effects on neurite outgrowth, only in the presence of 50 rg/ 
ml heparin. Treatment of PC 12 cells with heparin alone had no 
effect on AChE-specific activity, nor did it alter the effects of 
bFGF or NGF (data not shown). 
Discussion 
Comparison of responses to NGF and to FGFs 
Acidic and basic FGFs are peptide hormones, characterized 
mainly by their potent mitogenic and angiogenic activity. Both factors share the same spectrum of responsive cells (Gospoda- 
rowicz et al., 1986; Thomas and Gimenez-Gallego, 1986) and 
probably mediate their responses through the same receptor 
species (Neufeld and Gospodarowicz, 1986). In contrast to its 
mitogenic activity in most responsive cells, the present findings 
demonstrate that bFGF causes the cessation of cell division in 
cultures of PC 12 cells and, furthermore, can reproduce the entire 
spectrum of PC1 2 cell responses previously shown to be elicited 
by NGF. These include responses that are rapid (cell flattening, 
enhanced phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase) or delayed 
(neurite outgrowth, induction of phosphorylated MAP 1.2, reg- 
ulation of NILE and Thy- 1 glycoproteins, cessation of mitosis, 
elevation of AChE activity), as well as responses that have been 
shown to be either transcription-independent (neurite regener- 
ation, promotion of survival) or transcription-dependent (prim- 
ing, regulation of NILE and Thy-l glycoproteins, elevation of 
AChE activity). Positive results were also achieved for each of 
the responses tested with aFGF (promotion of neurite outgrowth 
and regeneration, elevation of AChE activity). These represent 
both short- and long-term, transcription-independent and tran- 
scription-dependent, responses, indicating that aFGF’s spec- 
trum of responses in PC12 cells is probably identical to that of 
NGF and bFGF. 
Additional PC12 cell studies have shown that, in common 
with NGF, bFGF can also rapidly and transiently stimulate 
transcription of the c-fos. c-myc, and actin genes (Greenberg et 3650 Rydel and Greene - FGF-Induced Neuronal Differentiation of PC12 Cells

tively, after 5 d. A 3% and 3.5-fold

al., 1985), elevate omithine decarboxylase activity (Togari et 
al., 1983, 1985), and bring about long-term regulation of a num- 
ber of specific mRNAs (Leonard et al., 1987). While some of 
the above actions (e.g., stimulation of c-fos and actin transcrip- 
tion, increases in omithine decarboxylase activity, promotion 
of survival) can be evoked by a number of different stimuli, at 
least several others appear at present to be quite specific to 
FGFs/NGF in the PC 12 system (e.g., promotion of neurite out- 
growth, priming, enhancement of AChE activity, elevation of 
phosphorylated MAPl.2, and induction of NILE glycoprotein). 
The molecular mechanisms whereby the FGFs and NGF pro- 
mote their cellular actions are not completely understood. How- 
ever, while NGF and bFGF trigger the same responses in PC 12 
cells, past findings (Togari et al., 1985) indicate that the 2 factors 
work via independent receptors. Nevertheless, it is intriguing 
that responses of PC12 cells to bFGF (Togari et al., 1985), like 
those of NGF (Seeley et al., 1984), are differentially blocked by 
compounds that interfere with methyltransferase activity. Like 
aFGF and bFGF, NGF has also been reported to have mitogenic 
activity (Burstein and Greene, 1982; Lillien and Claude, 1985), 
and it may be that the cellular response of any growth factor is 
governed more by the transduction mechanisms available with- in the cell than by any inherent activity associated with the 
factor itself. Thus, some mechanistic elements may well be shared 
between NGF and the FGFs. 
FGF-promoted neurite outgrowth 
The only responses for which the FGFs and NGF consistently 
showed quantitative differences were the rates for neurite ini- 
tiation and elongation in serum-containing medium. Thus, while 
all 3 factors promoted the formation of stable net&es, the net- 
work of outgrowth elicited by NGF at any given time of treat- 
ment was always of greater density. This differential response 
does not appear to be due to a reduced stability or enhanced 
degradation of FGFs, since decreasing the interval between 
administration of bFGF did not alter the density of neurite 
outgrowth. When neurite outgrowth was observed in serum-free 
medium, the differences between NGF and bFGF were no longer 
apparent. This suggests that serum factors may differentially 
modulate cellular responses to the 2 factors. 
Cell density was also observed to affect the rate of neurite 
initiation after treatment with bFGF or NGF. Outgrowth was 
more rapid when the cell density was increased from 10,000 to 
50,000 cells/cm*. This appeared to be due, at least in part, to 3 DAYS

soluble material released from the cells, since addition to low- 
density cultures of medium conditioned by high-density cultures 
produced enhancement in the responses to both bFGF and NGF. 
Many cell types, including PC 12 cells, release into conditioned 
medium substances that cause neurons to extend neurites both 
sooner and more rapidly than in their absence (reviewed in Berg, 
1984). These substances fall into 2 categories: factors that act 
as a component of the culture substratum and that promote 
neurite outgrowth even in the absence of a neurotrophic agent, 
and factors that do not absorb to the substratum and have no 
detectable effects on neurite outgrowth by themselves. The PC 12 
CM has not been characterized with regard to its possible action 
as a substrate-conditioning factor, but it clearly does not act as 
an NGF-like molecule for PC12 cells. In the absence of FGFs 
or NGF, CM has no effect on neurite initiation, neurite regen- 
eration, or protein phosphorylation. While CM enhanced both 
NGF- and FGF-promoted neurite outgrowth in a qualitatively 
similar manner, outgrowth elicited by the FGFs was neverthe- 
less always less dense. 
Togari et al. (1983, 1985) have previously reported that bFGF 
can initiate neurite formation in PC12 cell cultures. However, 
the processes that were formed were relatively short, resembled The Journal of Neuroscience, November 1987, 7(11) 3651 
those produced by exposure to CAMP analogs, and were found 
to retract within 3-6 d of treatment. In contrast, the present 
study demonstrates that aFGF- and bFGF-elicited processes are 
able to reach many hundreds of micrometers in length, that they 
are similar to those promoted by NGF, and that they are stable 
for at least 1 month (the longest time tested). In addition, where- 
as Togari et al. (1985) noted no effect of bFGF on AChE activity, 
the present study finds regulation of this enzyme by both FGFs. 
One possible basis for these differences is the source ofthe FGFs. 
The work of Togari et al. (1985) used primarily commercially 
prepared bFGF of uncertain purity, while the FGFs available 
for the present studies were highly purified. It may be that such 
commercially supplied bFGF was more rapidly inactivated or 
degraded, or contained inhibitory activities, thereby interfering 
with the expression of long-term responses to this factor. Con- 
sistent with this possibility is the observation of Togari et al. 
(1985) that the bFGF they employed promoted responses of 
rapid onset, such as specific changes in protein phosphorylation 
and induction of ornithine decarboxylase activity, but failed to 
elicit delayed responses, such as induction of AChE activity and 
stable growth of long neurites. 
Biological implications 
Although the PC12 line shares many properties with sympa- 
thetic neurons, it has been found that neither aFGF nor bFGF 
promotes survival or neurite outgrowth in cultures of neonatal 
rat superior cervical ganglionic neurons or of rat embryonic day 
15 dorsal root ganglionic neurons (Rydel and Greene, 1987). It 
may be that such neurons lack FGF receptors, at least at the 
ages at which they were tested. The presence of FGF responses 
in PC1 2 cell cultures may therefore suggest either that these 
pheochromocytoma cells differ from their neuronal counterparts 
by having acquired FGF receptors, or that the FGFs may affect 
sympathetic neurons or their precursors at stages of develop- 
ment different from those analyzed thus far. 
Despite the apparent lack of effect of either form of FGF on 
peripheral neurons, 2 very recent studies (Morrison et al., 1986; 
Walicke et al., 1986) have demonstrated that bFGF promotes 
the survival and outgrowth of neurites from cultured CNS neu- 
rons. The present observations have described a variety of ad- 
ditional actions of bFGF on a neuronal cell line and demonstrate 
that aFGF is capable of mimicking many, if not all, of these 
actions. These observations thus extend the range of actions 
that aFGF and bFGF may potentially exert on nerve cells, dur- 
ing either their development, repair, or maintenance. In addi- 
tion, since PC 12 cells are often used as a bioassay for the de- 
tection of putative neurotrophic agents (Edgar et al., 1979) it 
is quite possible that aFGF or bFGF may account for the neu- 
rotrophic activities found with various brain extracts. 
The PC 12 cell line has served as a highly useful model system 
with which to study the mechanism of action of NGF on neu- 
rons. The present work suggests that this cell line may also serve 
in a similar manner for mechanistic studies of acidic and basic 
FGF. Furthermore, since all 3 factors appear capable of eliciting 
the same wide spectrum of responses, molecular events specif- 
ically associated with FGFs and NGF in PC 12 cells may prove 
to illuminate the causal steps involved in neuronal differentia- 
tion.
