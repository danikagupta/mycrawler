Abstract:  
Textile industry is one of the most important and rapidly developing industrial sectors. It has a high importance in terms of  its 
environmental impact, as it consumed high amount of pro cessed water and produce highly polluted discharge water in large amount. 
Dying and printing mills comprises various operations include desizing, scouring, washing, finishing etc so they produces lar ge amount 
of polluted effluent having high chemical Oxyge n Demand. Advanced oxidation processes have emerged as a technology to accelerate 
the oxidation by generating hydroxyl radicals. Fenton treatment is one of the most attractive methods for the treatment of te xtile 
effluent. The use of Fenton’s reagent for t he degradation of organic matter present in dying and printing mi ll’s effluent has been 
studied. The characteristics of the wastewater were checked. Experiments were carried out at a laboratory scale at different dosage to 
find out the optimum dosage of Fe SO 4 and H 2O2.The optimum condition and efficiency were determined. Effect of the process 
parameter (dosage of FeSO 4 and H 2O2) has been checked.  Highest efficiency of COD  (74.24%) & BOD (72.41%) were achieved.

1. Introduction  
The textile dyeing industry consumes large quantities of water 
and produces large volumes of wastewater from different steps 
in the dyeing and finishing processes. Wastewater f rom 
printing and dyeing units is often rich in color, containing 
residues of reactive dyes and chemicals, and requires proper 
treatment before being released into the environment. Cotton 
provides an ecologically friendly textile, but more than 50% of 
its p roduction volume is dyed with reactive dyes. 
Unfortunately, dyes are unfavorable from an ecological point 
of view, because the effluents generated are heavily colored; 
contain high concentrations of salts, and exhibits high 
chemical oxygen demand/ biologic al oxygen demand values.  
Textile dyeing wastewater risk  
 Discharged wastewater by some industries under uncontrolled 
and unsuitable conditions is causing significant environmental 
problems. The importance of the pollution control and 
treatment is undoubted ly the key factor in the human future. If 
a textile mill discharges the wastewater into the local 
environment without any treatment, it will have a serious 
impact on natural water bodies and land in the surrounding area. High values of COD and BOD, presenc e of particulate 
matter and sediments, and oil and grease in the effluent causes 
depletion of dissolved oxygen, which has an adverse effect on 
the aquatic ecological system. Effluent from textile mills also 
contains chromium, which has a cumulative effect,  and higher 
possibilities for entering into the food chain. Due to usage of 
dyes and chemicals, effluents are dark in color, which 
increases the turbidity of water body.  
Textile wastewater is difficult to treat with the use of classical 
physicochemical and  biological methods, which is mainly due 
to their intensive color, high content of surfactants and other 
organic and inorganic compounds, a significant toxicity and 
poor biological recovery. The development of novel treatment 
methods encom passes investiga tions of advanced oxidation 
processes (AOPs), which are characterized by production of 
the hydroxyl radical (OH•) as a primary oxidant. Among 
various AOPs, the Fenton reagent (H 2O2/Fe2+) is one of the 
most effective methods of organic pollutant oxidation. The 
Fenton reagent has been found to be effective in treat ing 
various industrial wastewater components including aromatic 
amines and a wide variety of dyes as well as many other 
substances, e.g. pesticides and surfactants. Therefore, the 
Fenton reagent ha s been applied to treat a variety of wastes                     International Journal of Scientific Engineering and Technology                (ISSN : 2277 -1581)

industries .  
2. Fenton’s Oxidation  
The Fenton reagent, a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and iron 
(II) salt, is discovered by Henry J.H. Fenton. He described the  
oxidation power of hydrogen peroxide on certain organic 
molecules in which OH‾ radicals are produced from hydrogen 
peroxide under the addition of Fe(II) as a catalyst. This system 
is considered as the most promising treatment among AOPs 
for remediation of highly contaminated water.  
The oxidat ion of organic compounds is much faster in the 
solutions which contain hydrogen peroxide and iron (II) salts 
that form hydroxyl radicals during the reaction:  
 
H2O2+Fe2+ → Fe 3++OH–+HO•    (1) 
 
This system is known as the Fenton reagent, and is used for 
wastewater treatment. The oxidising efficiency of the Fenton 
reagent is the highest for pH ranging from 2 to 5, and for 
molar H 2O2 to Fe2+ ratio, about 1:1.  
The mechanism of this reagent was tested in detail for many 
reactions of organic compounds and enzymati c reactions; 
however it has not been fully explained because of the variety 
of iron (II) and iron (III) complexes, numerous radical 
intermediate products and their consecutive reactions.  
A significant role is played here by the formation of Fe3+ ions, 
whic h decompose H 2O2 and produce HO 2• radicals:  
 
Fe3++H 2O2 → Fe2++H++HO 2•    (2) 
 
In the solutions of H 2O2 and iron (II) salts, organics (RH) are 
oxidised during radical chain reactions. The main agents 
oxidising and propagating the reactions are HO• radicals:  
 
HO• + RH → H 2O + R•     (3) 
R• + H 2O2 → ROH + HO•    (4) 
 
HO• radicals also decompose H 2O2, producing HO 2• radicals.  
 
HO• + H 2O2 → H 2O+ HO 2•    (5) 
 
In the reactions of R• radicals with Fe3+ ions, carbo -cations R+ 
may be formed, while in these involving Fe2+ ions, carbo -
anions R- may occur. The kinetic chain is terminated in the 
reactions between radicals:  
 
HO• + HO• → H 2O2     (6) HO• + HO 2• → H 2O + O 2     (7) 
HO 2•+ HO 2• → H 2O2 + O 2    (8) 
 
Radicals R• and RO 2• also recombine, contributing in this way 
to the termination of the chain reaction:  
R• + RO 2• →ROOR     (9) 
 
RO 2• + RO 2• → ROOR + O 2     (10) 
 
These short characteristics of reactions (1) to (10) show the 
complex mechanism of the Fenton reagent's oxidation. The 
most significant are HO• radicals, bec ause they propagate the 
chain reaction of oxidation, and in parallel, in reaction (5), 
they produce HO 2 radicals which also take part in the 
propagation. Among various AOPs, the Fenton reagent is one 
of the most effective methods of organic pollutant oxida tion. 
Fenton technology with sufficient aeration is very effective 
treatment for COD -BOD removal due to proper & vigorous 
mixing of Fenton chemicals.  
 
However, it is necessary to exhaustively control the pH of the 
medium similar to dark Fenton. Generally, the pH range 
should be between 2.6 and 3 for the best performance of the 
system. The advantage of the Fenton reagent is that no ener gy 
input is necessary to activate hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, 
this method offers a cost -effective source of hydroxyl radi cals, 
using easy -to-handle reagents. How ever, disadvantages in 
using the Fenton reagent include the production of a 
substantial amount of Fe(OH) 3 precipitate and additional water 
pollution caused by the homogeneous catalyst that added as an 
iron salt, ca nnot be retained in the process. To solve these 
problems, the application of alternative iron sources as cata -
lysts in oxidizing organic contaminants has been studied 
extensively

Effect of FeSO 4 & H 2O2 on COD & BOD  
From the above set of experiment significant reduction was 
observed with:  
1) COD (25.16%) & BOD (25.07%) with dosage 3.5gm 
FeSO 4 + 3.5ml H 2O2 
2) COD (69.03%) & BOD (62.82%) with dosage 4.0gm 
FeSO 4 + 40ml H 2O2.  
3) COD (74.24%) & BOD (72.41%) with dosage 4.0gm 
FeSO 4 + 35ml H 2O2 
4) COD (74.19%) & BOD (72.55%) with dosage 5.5gm 
FeSO 4 + 20ml H 2O2 
The result indicates that very less reduction observed with 1:1 
ratio of reagents, the good reduction observed in COD a nd 
BOD values up to certain extent with increase in dosage of 
Fenton’s reagent with 1:10 ratio. Further increase in dosage 
shows the reduction in removal efficiency. By performing the 
experiment with keeping the dosage of FeSO 4 constant of 4 
gm, the highes t efficiency observed at the dosage of 4gm 
FeSO 4 + 35ml H 2O2 & with keeping the dosage of H 2O2 constant of 20 ml, the highest efficiency observed at the 
dosage of 5.5gm FeSO 4 + 20ml H 2O2. 
5. Conclusion  
It is evident from result & discussion that good reductio n is 
achieved with Fe+2:H2O2 – 1:10 ratio. Optimum Dosage found 
by experiments is 4.0gm FeSO 4 + 35ml H 2O2 with the 
reduction in COD (74.24%) & BOD (72.41%) . The 
application of Fenton’s reagent in Dyeing and Printing Mill’s 
wastewater treatment technology i s an efficient method for the 
decomposition of pollutants present in it and can be used 
successfully as a preliminary stage preceding its biological 
treatment. For higher removal efficiency one of the solution is 
to use two stage process - Fenton’s reaction  and Biological 
methods. It is necessary to check the reaction with respect to 
the large amount of various type of wastewater and find 
proper relation which enables the quick optimization of the 
process with respect to the changing input parameter s of the 
wastewater subjected to treatment.
