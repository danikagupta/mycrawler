ABSTRACT.  The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus 
elongatus  after refrigerated storage (4°C) and examine its potential as food for Artemia franciscana . Non -axenic 
semicontinuous cultures of S. elongatus  were maintained at 4°C for 8 weeks. In our bioassay, we fed A. 
franciscana  with refrigerated S. elongatus  and fresh cultures of the diatom Chaetoceros  muelleri  as a control. 
The S. elongatus  cultures could be refrigerated for up to 8 weeks without loss of its viability or alteration in its 
growth rate, cell size, and proximate composition. Fresh and eight wee k-refrigerated cultures of S. elongatus  
were similar with regard to fatty acid profiles. Significant differences in fatty acid profiles were found between 
refrigerated S. elongatus  and fresh C. muelleri  cultures. Vibrio  bacteria were not detected in any of  the S. 
elongatus  cultures (fresh or refrigerated) or fresh cultures C. muelleri . This work demonstrated that refrigerated 
S. elongatus  can be used to feed A. franciscana , maintaining similar growth rates and proximate composition 
compared with fresh C. muelleri  cultures as feed. Thus, S. elongatus  has potential aquaculture use as feed for A. 
franciscana .

INTRODUCTION  
The high costs that are associated with microalgae 
production, contamination risks, and seasonal 
variations in the food value of microalgae are 
significant factors for any aquaculture operation that 
depends on the mass culture of unicellular algae 
(Lavens & Sorgeloos, 1996; Meuller -Feuga, 2004). The 
maintenance of the viability and biochemical 
composition of microalgae throughout periods of 
intensive growth is a laborious task because these 
cultures must be transferred continuously, usually 
every week (Ande rsen, 2005). One solution to this 
problem is to harvest high amounts of microalgae and 
refrigerate them for a short time to sustain viability and 
nutritional composition. Refrigerated microalgae can 
be used to restart new cultures when algal production 
has decreased (Sánchez -Saavedra, 2006). A wide 
variety of methods, including storage under oil (Day et 
al., 1997), drum drying (Soeder, 1986; Laing & 
Millican, 1992), lyophilization (Molina -Grima et al ., 
1994), and storage at low and ultralow temperatures

Voltolina, 1995; Taylor & Fletcher, 1999), have been 
used for long -term preservation of microalgae.  
In recent years, drum -dried and lyophilized 
microalgae have been introduced to the market for use 
as food for certain larvae and filter feeders (Richmond, 
1986; Andersen, 2005). Cryopreservation of biological 
specimens has been achieved successfully using 
protocols that have been developed more or less 
empirically (Karlson & Toner, 1996). The benefit of 
this method is that cells can be stored for long periods 
without lacking viability and changes in their 
biochemical composition. This approach is used widel y 
in the conservation of genetic resources of many plants 
and animals. However, for several aquaculture 
activities, such as growing microalgae for use as food, 
the cryopreservation of microalgae does not have any 
significant advantages compared with drum d rying and 
lyophilization. Further, cryoprotectant solutions, when 
used to enhance the viability of microalgae, might have 
toxic effects on organisms that consume thawed 
microalgae, because such substances cannot be 
eliminated from the culture media (Tzoven is et al ., 
2004).

Short -term storage at 4°C is an economical and 
simple method that has been used to store concentrated 
live microalgae (Chen, 2001; Sánchez -Saavedra, 2006; 
Sánchez -Saavedra &  Núñez -Zarco, 2012, 2015). In the 
past several years, some companies have introduced 
several species of microalgae to the market as 
concentrated pastes that can be maintained at 4°C and 
used as food. Although the nutritional value of these 
microalgae is sa tisfactory, they cannot be used as 
inocula due to their poor viability (Day et al ., 1997; 
Andersen, 2005).  
Much effort has been made to preserve the 
microalgae species that are most commonly used as 
food in aquaculture (Beaty & Parker, 1992; Cañavate & 
Lubian, 1994, 1995a, 1995b, 1997; Cañavate & 
Fernández -Díaz, 2001). However, endemic microalgae 
cultures could be novel options for feeding local 
species, because these microalgae are part of their 
natural diet. For example, Synechococcus elongatus  
was isolat ed from a shrimp farm in the coastal lagoon 
of Nayarit, México (21°32’N, 105°17’W) (Aguilar -
May, 2002). This cyanobacterium has been considered 
to have tremendous potential for aquaculture use due to 
its advantageous properties, such as its high tolerance 
to variations in light and temperature (Aguilar -May, 
2002; Castillo -Barrera et al.,  2002), biochemical 
composition (Campa -Ávila, 2002), ability to remove 
nutrients (Aguilar -May & Sánchez -Saavedra, 2009; 
Castro -Ceseña et al., 2015), and high food quality fo r 
the rotifer Branchionus plicatilis (Campa -Ávila, 2002). 
The diatom Chaetoceros muelleri  is widely used as 
food for mollusks and is frequently used to feed 
Artemia  in several commercial hatcheries (Gómez -Gil 
et al. , 2002; López -Elías et al., 2003, 2005; M euller -
Feuga, 2004). However, C. muelleri  is not tolerant to 
extensive changes in temperature and light (Olaizola & 
Yamamoto, 1994; Brown et al., 1997; Piña et al. , 2006; 
Liang et al., 2006).  
Artemia  is a widely applied zooplankton strain for 
food in aqua culture activities, due to their adaptability 
to environmental conditions (tolerance to salinity, 
temperature, and irradiance), feasibility of storing their 
cysts for several years, ease of hatching of the Artemia 
nauplii, nutritional value, and low cost (Lavens et al., 
1989; Lavens & Sorgeloos, 1996, 2000; Villamil et al., 
2003). Also, Artemia is a common biological model for 
different pharmacological tests, such as assays for 
determining the ecotoxicity and bioact ivity of 
medicinal plants (Vanhaecke et al., 1981; Krishnaraju 
et al., 2005; Pérez & Lazo, 2010).  
We hypothesized that the cyanobacterium 
Synechococcus elongatus,  stored for eight weeks in a 
refrigerator, maintains its nutritional value and viability 
for aquaculture activities. To increase the use of a local S. elongatus  strain, we evaluated: 1) the viability of S. 
elongatus , after eight weeks of refrigeration (4°C), 2) 
changes in the cell size of fresh and refrigerated 
cultures of S. elongat us, 3) the grow th rate of recovered 
cells after refrigeration, 4) weekly changes in the 
proximate composition of the refrigerated of S. 
elongatu s, 5) fatty acid profiles of S. elongatus  and C. 
muelleri,  used as food for Artemia  franciscana , 6) 
Vibrio  loads from fresh and refrigerated cultures of S. 
elongatus,  and 7) performance of refrigerated S. 
elongatus  as feed for A. franciscana . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS  
Culture conditions of Synechococcus elongatus  
The strain that we used was the cyanobacter ium 
Syne chococcus elongatus  isolated from Nayarit, 
México by Aguilar -May (2002). Non -axenic semi -
continuous cultures were maintained by 20% daily 
dilution in 18 -L carboys with 10 L “f” medium 
(Guillard, 1975) and twice the concentration of 
vitamins as described by  Aguilar -May (2002). The 
culture conditions were: temperature 23 ± 1°C, salinity 
33 ± 1, sufficient stirring with air bubbling , and pH 
between 7.5 and 8.5. The pH was maintained with Tris 
(hydroxymethyl amino -methane) as described by 
Guillard (1975). Continuous light (100 µmol m-2 s-1) 
was supplied by two 40 W Philips cool -white  fluorescent 
lamps (1.2 m length).   
Culture conditions of Chaetoceros muelleri   
Fresh cultures of Chaetoceros muelleri  were used as the 
control for the feeding bioassays. Cells of C. muelleri  
were obtained from “Centro Reproductor de Especies 
Marinas (CREMES)” Sonora, México and maintained 
in triplicate as non -axenic semi -continuous cultures 
with 30% daily dilution in 18 -L carboys (Pacheco -Vega 
& Sánchez -Saavedra, 2009) with 10 L “f” medium 
(Guillard, 1975) under similar culture conditions as the 
S. elongatus . 
Refrigerated storage of Synechococcus elongatus  
culture  
After one week of growth, the S. elongatus  cultures 
were c onsidered to be steady (stationary growth phase), 
and 2 L of the culture was harvested from each carboy, 
distributed into 24 sterilized, transparent glass bottles 
(Gerber® flasks) , covered with aluminum foil, and 
stored at 4°C in a refrigerator for eight weeks.  
Evaluation of viability  
Viability was measured as the ability of cyano -
bacterium to grow after refrigeration. After each week Artemia  fed with refrigerated cyanobacteria                                                                        939 
 
 
refrigeration (week 1 to 8), 3 bottles were taken from 
the refrigerator, from each of which 3 mL aliquots were 
used as inocula. The inocula were added to 15 mL 
culture tubes that contained 10 mL “f” medium 
(Guillard, 1975). The cultures were maintained under 
the same conditions as described above, excluding the 
aeration. The tubes were stirred manually for 5 s daily 
to avo id precipitation of cells. Viability was estimated 
using daily measurements of the optical density of the 
tubes at 550 nm with a Hach DR 4000 UV 
spectrophotometer against a standard curve that had 
been generated using optical density and cell 
concentration . 
Evaluation of cell size and growth rate  
Cell size was determined weekly by measuring the 
diameter, length, and width of 30 randomly selected 
cells. Cells were visualized with a compound 
microscope (Olympus model BH 2) using a digital 
camera and Image Pro -Discovery, version 5.1. Growth 
rates were calculated in the exponential growth phase 
by log 2 transformation (Arredondo -Vega & Voltolina, 
2007) and the equation described by Fogg & Thake 
(1987).   
Proximate composition  
The proximate cell composition was determined 
weekly in triplicate sets of fresh cultures (week 0) and 
refrigerated samples of S. elongatus . Aliquots (5 mL) 
were passed through Whatman GF/C glass filters. 
Proteins were extracted using 0.1 N NaOH according to 
the methodology described by Campa -Ávila (2002) and 
determined according to Lowry et al . (1951) using 
bovine albumin (98%) as the standard. Carbohydrates 
were extracted following the methodology of Whyte 
(1987) and the determination was performed accord ing 
to Dubois et al.  (1956) using glucose (99%) as the 
standard. Lipids were extracted following the 
methodology of  Bligh & Dyer (1959) and determined 
according to the method of Pande et al. (1963) using 
tripalmitin (99%) as the standard.  
All amounts in t he proximate analysis were 
expressed as a percentage of the organic fraction of the 
cells. The organic dry weight was measured by placing 
the samples in an oven at 60°C, and ash content was 
generated by incinerating the samples at 470°C 
according to method ology of Sorokin (1973). The 
organic dry weight and proximate composition of fresh 
cultures of C. muelleri  were also determined as 
described above.  
Fatty acids  
Samples (500 mL) of fresh and refrigerated (8 weeks) 
S. elongatus  and fresh C. muelleri  were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the concentrated 
biomass was maintained individually, store d at -80°C, 
and lyophilized to determine fatty acid profiles. Total 
lipids were extracted according to the methodology 
described by Folch et al . (1957). Fatty acid methyl 
esters (FAMEs) were measured according to Metcalfe 
et al. (1966) and analyzed on a gas chromatograph (GC 
Agilent Technologies 7890A) using a flame ionization 
detector and capillary column (Agilent J&W, 123 -3232 
DB-FFAP, 30 -m leng th, 0.320 mm inner diameter, 0.25 
µm film thickness). Hydrogen was used as the carrier 
gas. The initial temperature was 120°C, which was 
increased to 230°C in 4 min. FAMEs were identified, 
based on a comparison of their retention times to those 
of a commer cial standard (37 Component Supelco 
FAME Mix Sigma). The concentration of each fatty 
acid was calculated using Chem Station, B.04.01 
(Agilent, USA).  
Vibrio  loads  
Concentrations of Vibrio  spp. in fresh and refrigerated 
cultures of S. elongatus  and C. muelleri  were measured 
by passing 10 mL of culture through 47 mm MF 
Millipore (nitrocellulose with 0.22 µm pore aperture) 
filters. The filters were then incubated with thiosulfate -
citrate -bile salts -sucrose agar (TCBS) medium  (DIFCO) 
at 37°C for 24 h. The concentration of Vibrio  was 
determined as colony -forming units (CFU) according 
to Kobayashi et al. (1963).  
Feeding bioassay  
Commercial Artemia  franciscana  cysts were obtained 
from San Francisco Bay Brand. To obtain organisms 
with the same age, the coveri ng over the cysts was 
removed with 6% sodium hypochlorite ( Da Rocha et 
al., 2005) and incubated in a 2 L conic container with 
1.5 L seawater at 20°C with aeration for 8 h. The nauplii 
were collected on a 200 µm mesh screen, washed with 
UV-treated seawater,  and distributed to six 500 mL 
plastic containers to a final concentration of 1 nauplii 
per milliliter. Nauplii’s culture conditions were: tempe -
rature 21 ± 1°C; salinity 33 ± 1; stirring with frothing, 
provided by an aeration stone throughout the entire 
culture; oxygen concentration 7 ± 0.5 mg L-1; pH 
between 8.0 and 8.5; continuous light by two 40 W 
Philips cool -white fluorescent lamps at an irradiance of 
50 µmol m-2 s-1 (1.2 m length); filtered seawater (10, 5, 
and 1 µm cartridges and activated carbon);  disinfection 
with 6% chlorine (3 mL L-1) for 24 h; and precipitation 
with sodium thiosulfate (0.15 g L-1).  
A set of three separate plastic containers, as 
described above, selected at random and used to fill 
another set of 500 mL plastic containers. Th e final 
concentration of nauplii  in each container was 125 L-1. 940                                                             Latin American Journal of Aquatic Research  
 
 
Nauplii were fed with refrigerated (8 weeks) S. 
elongatus  cells. This set of containers was defined as 
the experimental group. For the control group, another 
set of 500 mL plastic containers was prepared as 
described above, and the nauplii were fed fresh C. 
muelleri  cultures. Food ratios were calculated 
according to Tackaert et al . (1987), and increased, 
depending on the age  of A. franciscana .  
The experiment was completed after 7 days. All 
treatm ents were maintained in triplicate. An unfed 
control group was not included in this experiment 
because, in previous trials, they survive for only 2 days 
(data not shown). Each day, 10 A. franciscana  were 
collected from each treatment and measured under a 
light microscope (Olympus model BH -2) with regard to 
total length. For these measurements, photographs were 
taken with a digital camera using Image Pro -Discovery, 
version 5.1. A. franciscana  survival was determined, 
based on the initial and final numbers, a nd expressed as 
a percentage. At the end of the experiment, the total 
biomass of A. franciscana  was harvested and washed 
with ammonium formate (3%) to remove salt residues; 
then, the dry weight was estimated by placing the 
samples in an oven at 60°C as in Sorokin (1973). The 
proximate composition of A. franciscana  was also 
determined as described above.  
Data analysis  
One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA Sokal &  Rohlf, 
1979) was used to compare the cell growth, cell size, 
proximate composition (proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, 
and ash content), and dry weight of S. elongatus  at 
different refrigeration storage times. The same analysis 
was performed to compare the proximate composition 
between S. elongatus and C. muelleri . The fatty acid 
content of the strains was not compared due to the lack 
of repeated samples in each treatment. One -way 
analysis of variance was used to compare the length, 
survival, and proximate c omposition of A. franciscana  
that was fed refrigerated S. elongatus or fresh C. 
muelleri as a control. Statistical analyses were 
performed using Statistica 7.0 for Windows (StatSoft 
Inc., 1996). A value of P < 0.05 was chosen as the level 
of significance.  
RESULTS  
Viability of refrigerated Synechococcus elongatus   
No significant differences in viability ( P = 0.09) were 
found between fresh (week 0) and refrigerated S. 
elongatus . The average cell concentration of S. 
elongatus  cultures that were established with fresh 
(week 0) inocula was 31.6 ×106 cell mL-1, versus  39.3×106 cell mL-1 with inocula that had been 
refrigerated for up to 8 weeks (Fig. 1).  
Cell size and growth rate of refrigerated 
Synechococcus elongatus  
Cell size did not differ between fresh (week 0, 2.6 ± 0.1 
μm) and refrigerated (8 weeks, 2.5 ± 0.2 μm) S. 
elongatus  (P > 0.05) (Table 1). Also, no significant 
differences in growth rates ( P > 0.05) were found 
between cultures that were started from fresh ( week 0) 
and refrigerated (up to 8 weeks) inoculum. The growth 
rate of fresh S. elongatus  cultures (week 0) was 0.30 ± 
0.1 divisions d-1, 0.32 ± 0.8 divisions d-1 for cultures 
that were initiated from inoculum that had been 
refrigerated for 1 week, and 0.35  ± 0.6 divisions d-1 for 
8-week -refrigerated S. elongatus  (Table 1).  
Proximate composition of refrigerated Synechococcus  
elongatus  
The proximate composition (proteins, carbohydrates, 
and lipids) of S. elongatus  was similar when maintained 
fresh (week 0) or refrigerated for up to 8 weeks ( P = 
0.089). The average protein concentration at week 0 
was 40.13 ± 0.64% versus  42.47 ± 0.52% for 
refrigerated cultures at the end of the experiment (week 
8) (Table 2). The ave rage carbohydrate concentration at 
week 0 was 23.14 ± 0.82% compared with 22.52 ± 
1.19% for refrigerated cultures at week 8 (Table 2). The 
average lipid concentration at week 0 was 15.25 ± 
1.19% and 16.19 ± 0.54% for refrigerated cells at w eek 
8 (Table 2).  The ash content of fresh cultures was 27.54 
± 2.74%, compared with 24.61 ± 3.47% at the end of 
the experiment (week 8) (Table 2).  
Fatty acids   
The fatty acid content was similar between fresh and 
refrigerated cultures of S. elongatus  (Table 3) but 
differed between fresh and refrigerated cultures of S. 
elongatus  and fresh C. muelleri  cultures (Table 3). Yet, 
the content of saturated fatty acids was similar between 
S. elongatus  and C. muelleri . The levels of C16:0 and 
total saturated fa tty acids were slightly higher in S. 
elongatus , whereas C16:1n -7 and total monounsa -
turated fatty acid levels were higher C. muelleri . 
Polyunsaturated fatty acids and C18:3n -3 content was 
high in fresh and refrigerated S. elongatus  compared 
with C. mueller i. However, several polyunsaturated 
fatty acids (PUFAs), such as ARA, EPA, and DHA, 
were not detected in S. elongatus .  
Vibrio loads  
No Vibrio  bacteria were detected in any S. elongatus  
culture (fresh or refrigerated) or in the fresh C. muelleri  
cultures.  Artemia  fed with refrigerated cyanobacteria                                                                        941

Feeding bioassay  
The protein and carbohydrate content was significantly 
higher in S. elongatus  than in C. muelleri . However, C. 
muelleri  contained significantly more lipids and ash 
(Table 4 a). The proximate composition of A. 
franciscana adults did not differ significantly (P > 0.05) 
when fed refrigerated S. elongatus  cells or fresh C. 
muelleri  cultures (Table 4 b). 
The length of A. franciscana  nauplii was similar      
(P > 0.05), regardless of being fed refrigerated S. 
elongatus cells or fresh C. muelleri  cultures (Table 5). 
The length of A. franciscana  metanauplii, juveniles, and adults was significantly higher ( P < 0.05) when fed 
refrigerated S. elongatus . The survival of Artemia  was 
similar when fed refrigerated S. elongatus  or fresh C. 
muelleri ; however, the weight of A. franciscana  adults 
of was significantly higher ( P < 0.05) when given 
refrigerated S. elongatus  as food . 
DISCUSSION  
Cyanobacteria are usually cosmopolitan organisms 
with a simple cellular organization and high adaptive 
plasticity, which are beneficial for u se in aquaculture. 
Certain cyanobacteria tolerate high and low 
temperatures  and can grow in darkness and use 
atmospheric nitrogen (Taylor, 1981). However, several 
factors can affect the recovery of cyanobacteria when 
they are exposed to extreme conditions,  the most 
significant of which are the growth cycle from which 
they were harvested, growth stage, cell density, cell 
size, and culture conditions (Ben -Amotz & Gilboa, 
1980).  
Cyanobacteria are found in hot springs and thermal 
pools  and are the dominant organism in Polar lakes 
(Stal, 1995; Graham & Wilcox, 2000).  Based on strains 
that have been isolated from polar lakes, the 
temperature for the growth of most cyanobacteria 
ranges from 15 to -35°C. This finding suggests that 
such str ains are not specifically adapted to low 
temperatures but can tolerate suboptimal temperatures.

Resistance to desiccation, freeze -thaw cycles, and high 
solar irradiation and their maintenance of a slow growth 
rate contribute to their survival in polar aquatic systems 
(Tang et al., 1997). Thus, to optimize their recovery, we 
established the ideal cond itions for S. elongatus  and 
refrigerated this cyanobacterium when the cultures 
were in the exponential phase of growth to obtain the 
peak cell densities and high protein content (Fogg & 
Thake, 1987).  
Our results showed the high adaptability of S. 
elongatus  to extreme changes in temperature and light. 
The significant viability of refrigerated S. elongatus  
under darkness may be attributed to their ability to slow 
their metabolism. The growth rates of fresh and 
refrigerated S. elongatus were low ( 0.30 divisio ns d-1) 
compared with 0.48 divisions d-1, as reported by 
Aguilar -May (2002) and Campa -Ávila (2002) for the 
same strain. These differences could be due to the high 
culture volume and lower light intensity used in the 
experiments described by the latter aut hors.  
The nutritional value of microalgae must be 
considered because the performance of organisms that consume it depends on its nutritional profile  (Richmond, 
2003; Muller -Feuga, 2004). Although many species of 
microalgae that are suited for mass culture are used as 
food in aquaculture, not all yield good growth and 
survival, due to differences in biochemical composition 
and environmental adapta -bility (Webb & Chu, 1983; 
Enright et al., 1986; D'Souza & Loneragan, 1999). We 
did not detect any differences in biochemical compo -
sition between fresh and refrigerated cultures, 
indicating that S. elongatus  decreased its metabolic 
activity and did not use sto rage products. Live 
microalgae cells have several strategies for surviving at 
low temperatures, such as the production of antifreeze 
proteins, accumulation of polyunsaturated fatty acid 
chains, or  over-excitation of photosynthetic apparatus 
(Morgan -Kiss et al., 2006).  
The nutritional value of refrigerated S. elongatus  
was good when used as feed for A. franciscana . The 
strain C. muelleri  was used as a control because this 
diatom is widely used in shrimp farms in northwest 
México (López -Elías et al ., 2005). T he similar

cultures demonstrated that refrigerated S. elongatus  
meets the nutritional requirements of A. franciscana . 
The fatty acid profile of S. elongatus  and C. muelleri  
differed, and their compositions were what has 
typically been reported for cyanobacteria and diatoms 
(Sánchez -Saavedra & Voltolina, 1995; Campa -Ávila, 
2002; Renaud et al ., 2002). Cyanobacteria usually 
harbor high content of C16:1 and C18:1 and low 
polyunsaturated fatty acids (Anahas & Muralitharan, 
2015). Conversely, diatoms have high concentrations 
of 14:0, 16:0, 16:1(n -7), and 20:5(n -3), constituting 
70% to 90% of the total fatty acid content (Volkman et 
al., 1989; Brown et al., 1997; Strandberg et al.,  2015). 
In our study, for C. muelleri , these fatty acids 
represented over 90% of total fatty acids, versus  
56.86% to 56.90% for fresh and 8 -week -stored S. 
elongatus . Thus, the proximate composition of A. 
franciscana  adults could be attributed to the findings 
that it is not extrinsically determined in the long term 
and that A. franciscana  can modify its dietary amino 
and fatty acid levels (Lavens et al ., 1989; Sánchez -
Saavedra & Voltolina, 1995).  
The growth of A. franciscana  nauplii d id not differ 
when fed C. muelleri or S. elongatus , possibly due to 
storage reserves in the nauplii. However, metanauplii 
that were fed refrigerated S. elongatus  were larger than 
those that were given C. muelleri . Overall, the length of 
A. franciscana  at different stages under both experi -
mental culture conditions was similar to those reported 
by others authors (Sick, 1976; Correa -Sandoval, 1991).  
Infections that are caused by luminescent vibrio can 
yield dramatic losses in intensive rearing of mollusks, 
finfish, and lobsters. Cysts of A. franciscana , 
microalgae, and water are the most common vectors 
with regard to the propagation of Vibrio  spp. in 
aquaculture activities (López -Torres et al., 2000). We 
did not detect Vibrio  in our fresh or refrigerated 
cultures, perhaps due to the high quality of the cultures 
and the antibacterial characteristics of S. elongatus  and 
C. muelleri  (Sánchez -Saavedra et al., 2010). Conse -
quently, S. elongatus  can provide additional benefits by 
reducing bacterial load (González -Davis et al. , 2012; 
Molina -Cárdenas et al. , 2014).  
Hatchery rearing of bivalve mollusks, certain 
marine finfish in the early stages, and crustaceans  
depend on the production of live microalgae. The costs 
for producing microalgae constitute 50% of the entire 
hatchery production (Richmond, 2003). The use of 
refrigerated microalgae is a viable approach toward 
maintaining small cultures when there are bo ttlenecks 
in the production of microalgae. Further, S. elongatus  
can be used as a biofilter for “green water culture” due 
to its high capacity for removing nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorous (Aguilar -May & Sánchez -
Saavedra, 2009; Castro -Ceseña et al., 2015 ). 
In conclusion, refrigerated storage of S. elongatus  
renders the cells dormant for up to 8 weeks. This strain 
has potential use aquaculture, based on its high -quality 
proximate composition and nutritional value for A. 
franciscana .
