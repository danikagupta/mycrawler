Previous  research  indicates  that  rainbow  trout  Oncorhynchus  mykiss  begin  to  exhibit  health  and  wel-
fare problems when cultured  within water recirculating  aquaculture  systems  (WRAS)  operated  at  low
exchange (6.7  days  hydraulic  retention  time)  and  a  mean  feed  loading  rate  of  4.1  kg  feed/m3daily  makeup
ﬂow. These studies could not conclusively  determine  the  causative  agent  of  the  health  and  welfare
issues, but  accumulation  of  mean  nitrate  nitrogen  (NO 3-N)  to  approximately  100  mg/L  was  determined
to be a potential cause of abnormal  swimming  behaviors  such  as  “side  swimming”  and  rapid  swimming
velocity. A  subsequent  controlled,  3-month  study  was  conducted  to  determine  if  NO 3-N  concentrations
of 80–100 mg/L  resulted  in  chronic  health  issues  for  rainbow  trout.  Equal  numbers  of  rainbow  trout
(16.4 ±  0.3  g)  were  stocked  within  six  replicated  9.5  m3WRAS.  Three  WRAS  were  maintained  with  a
mean NO 3-N  concentration  of  30  mg/L  (“low”)  resulting  from  nitriﬁcation,  and  three  WRAS  were  main-
tained with  a  mean  concentration  of  91  mg/L  (“high”)  via  continuous  dosing  of  a  sodium  nitrate  stock
solution in addition to nitriﬁcation.  All  six  WRAS  were  operated  with  equal  water  exchange  (1.3  days
mean hydraulic  retention  time)  and  mean  feed  loading  rates  (0.72  kg  feed/m3daily  makeup  ﬂow),  which
provided enough ﬂushing to  limit  the  accumulation  of  other  water  quality  concentrations.  Rainbow  trout
growth was  not  signiﬁcantly  impacted  by  the  high  NO 3-N  treatment.  Cumulative  survival  for  ﬁsh  cul-
tured within the  high  NO 3-N  WRAS  was  lower  and  bordered  statistical  signiﬁcance,  which  resulted  in
total rainbow  trout  biomass  that  was  signiﬁcantly  lower  for  this  group  at  study’s  end.  In  addition,  a  sig-
niﬁcantly greater prevalence  of  side  swimming  rainbow  trout  occurred  in  the  high  NO 3-N  treatment,
as was  observed  during  previous  research.  Swimming  speeds  were  generally  greater  for  rainbow  trout
cultured in  the  high  NO 3-N  treatment,  but  were  not  always  signiﬁcantly  different.  Although  most  water
quality variables  were  controlled,  signiﬁcant  differences  between  treatments  for  the  concentrations  of
other water  quality  parameters  inhibited  deﬁnitive  conclusions  regarding  the  effect  of  NO 3-N.  However,
due to  the  unlikely  toxicity  of  confounding  water  quality  parameters,  study  results  provided  strong  evi-
dence that  relatively  low  NO 3-N  levels,  80–100  mg/L,  were  related  to  chronic  health  and  welfare  impacts
to juvenile  rainbow  trout  under  the  described  conditions.

1. Introduction
Land-based  water  recirculation  aquaculture  systems  (WRAS)
are becoming  increasingly  utilized  due  to  water  resource  limita-
tions; more  stringent  waste  discharge  standards;  and  the  need  for
increased environmental  control,  biosecurity,  and  reduced  envi-
ronmental impacts  from  ﬁsh  farms  (Summerfelt  and  Vinci,  2008).
These systems  are  often  operated  intensively  in  a  semi-closed

make-up water  requirement  and  allows  for  effective  treatment
of relatively  small,  concentrated  waste  streams  (Summerfelt  and
Vinci, 2008).  However,  as  the  exchange  rates  of  WRAS  are  reduced
and feed  loading  rates  subsequently  increased,  the  concentrations
of a  variety  of  water  quality  constituents  accumulate  (Davidson
et al.,  2009,  2011a,  2011b).
There is  increasing  evidence  that  accumulating  water  qual-
ity concentrations  within  low  exchange  WRAS  can  negatively
impact cultured  species  (Deviller  et  al.,  2005;  Davidson  et  al.,
2009, 2011a;  Martins  et  al.,  2009a,  2009b).  In  particular,  mount-
ing evidence  suggests  that  relatively  low  NO 3-N  concentrations,
once considered  to  be  harmless  (Russo,  1985;  Wedemeyer,  1996;
Colt and  Tomasso,  2001;  Timmons  et  al.,  2001;  Colt,  2006),  could
cause chronic  toxicity  to  various  species  cultured  in  WRAS  that

are  operated  with  minimal  water  exchange.  For  example,  Hamlin
(2005)  concluded  that  NO 3-N  concentrations  accumulating  within
WRAS  could  be  of  concern  for  Siberian  sturgeon  Acipenser  baeri .
Hamlin  (2005)  determined  that  the  96-h  LC50for  Siberian  stur-
geon  (7–700  g)  ranged  from  397  to  1098  mg/L  NO 3-N  and  cited
anecdotal  evidence  that  concentrations  as  low  as  90  mg/L  NO 3-
N resulted  in  increased  mortality.  Van  Bussel  et  al.  (2012)  found
that  the  growth  of  juvenile  turbot  Psetta  maxima  was  negatively
impacted  by  NO 3-N  concentrations  ≥125  mg/L  and  that  health  and
feed  efﬁciency  was  reduced  at  ≥250  mg/L.  In  a  study  evaluating  the
potential  effect  of  200  mg/L  NO 3-N  on  hybrid  striped  bass  Morone
chrysops  ×  M.  saxatalis ,  Hrubec  (1996)  reported  increased  mortality,
decreased  immune  function,  and  physiological  changes  consis-
tent  with  pathology;  such  as  gill  hyperplasia  and  blood  chemistry
alterations.  Recently,  Schram  et  al.  (2012)  found  that  feed  intake
and  growth  rates  decreased  for  African  catﬁsh  Clarias  gariepinus
exposed  to  NO 3-N  concentrations  >140  mg/L.  In  addition,  Davidson
et  al.  (2011a)  suggested  that  approximately  100  mg/L  NO 3-N  was
a  potential  causative  agent  of  abnormal  rainbow  trout  swimming
behaviors  such  as  rapid  swimming  velocity  and  side  swimming,
and that  NO 3-N  concentrations  >400  mg/L  were  potentially  related
to  more  severe  physiological  effects  such  as  spinal  deformities  and
increased  mortality.  Davidson  et  al.  (2011a)  could  not  conclusively
determine  the  parameter  that  created  the  ﬁsh  health  issues,  but
statistical  correlation  analysis  indicated  that  NO 3-N  accumulation
was  a  potential  culprit.
In  general,  research  to  evaluate  chronic  NO 3-N  toxicity  to  cul-
tured  species  across  various  life  stages  is  limited  (Camargo  et  al.,
2005 ).  Several  studies  have  evaluated  acute  NO 3-N  toxicity  to  rain-
bow  trout.  Westin  (1974)  reported  a  96-h  LC50of  1364  mg  NO 3-N/L
and  a  7-day  LC50of  1068  mg  NO 3-N/L  for  rainbow  trout  ﬁngerlings.
Despite  the  relatively  high  NO 3-N  levels  reported  for  acute  toxicity,
Westin  (1974)  recommended  a  maximum  allowable  concentration
of  approximately  57  mg  NO 3-N/L  for  chronic  exposure  and  only
5.7  mg  NO 3-N/L  for  optimal  health  and  growth  of  trout.  Several
other  studies  have  indicated  that  NO 3-N  can  be  chronically  toxic
to  salmonid  eggs  and  fry  at  concentrations  <200  mg/L  with  sub-
lethal  effects  occurring  at  <25  mg/L  (Kincheloe  et  al.,  1979;  McGurk
et  al.,  2006 ).
Although  some  information  is  available  regarding  the  effect
of  NO 3-N  to  rainbow  trout,  chronic  toxicity  research  is  lacking.
Chronic  toxicity  studies  are  a  sensitive  indicator  of  the  sublethal
effects  to  species  and  help  to  deﬁne  the  lowest  concentration  of
a  water  quality  parameter  that  has  a  signiﬁcant  negative  effect
(Petrocelli,  1985 ).  Deﬁnition  of  chronic  NO 3-N  toxicity  thresholds
for  rainbow  trout  and  other  species  cultured  in  WRAS  is  imperative
because:  (1)  it  provides  a  guideline  for  culture  conditions  that  are
conducive  with  optimal  health,  welfare,  and  performance  of  cul-
tured  species  and  (2)  it  establishes  a  critical  water  quality  criterion
that  impacts  the  WRAS  engineering  design,  including  the  makeup
water  ﬂushing  and  feed  loading  rates,  requirements  for  denitri-
ﬁcation,  as  well  as  the  wastewater  discharge  volume  and  energy
required  to  heat  or  cool  the  WRAS.
Therefore,  a  controlled  study  was  conducted  that  would  aid
in  the  establishment  of  a  chronic  nitrate  nitrogen  threshold  for
juvenile  rainbow  trout  by  evaluating  the  potential  effects  of
80–100  mg/L  NO 3-N  on  trout  performance,  health,  and  welfare.  The
research  described  herein  was  complementary  to  Davidson  et  al.
(2011a)  which  identiﬁed  NO 3-N  as  a  potential  cause  of  rainbow
trout  health  and  welfare  problems  in  low  exchange  WRAS.
2.  Methods
2.1.  Rainbow  trout
All  rainbow  trout  used  for  the  study  were  hatched  within  a  recir-
culating hatching  system  and  then  cultured  within  0.5  m3circulartanks  within  a  ﬂow-through  system  in  which  NO 3-N  concentra-
tions  averaged  <3  mg/L.  Rainbow  trout  (103  ±  1  mm;  16.4  ±  0.3  g)
from  each  0.5  m3ﬂow-through  tank  were  randomized  and  divided
equally  amongst  six  replicated  WRAS  at  an  initial  stocking  density
of  6  kg/m3(2050  ﬁsh/tank).  The  trout  were  108  days  old  (post-
hatch) when  the  study  began.
2.2. Experimental treatments
Six  replicated  WRAS  (9.5  m3)  were  used  (Fig.  1)  during  a
3-month  study.  Rainbow  trout  within  two  randomly  selected
sets  of  3  WRAS  were  exposed  to  the  following  treatments:
(1)  “high”  NO 3-N  (target  80–100  mg/L)  and  (2)  “low”  NO 3-N
(target  20–40  mg/L),  representing  the  control.  Nitrate  nitrogen
concentrations  for  the  high  treatment  were  controlled  by  continu-
ously  dosing  a  sodium  nitrate  stock  solution  into  the  LHO  sump
using a  peristaltic  pump,  in  addition  to  the  natural  accumula-
tion  resulting  as  an  end  product  of  nitriﬁcation.  Nitrate  nitrogen
concentrations  within  the  control  systems  were  created  only  as
an  end  product  of  the  nitriﬁcation  process  and  controlled  by
water  exchange.  All  ﬂuidized  sand  bioﬁlters  were  fully  acclimated
and  capable  of  complete  nitriﬁcation  when  the  study  began.  In
addition,  a  sodium  sulfate  solution  was  continuously  dosed  to
the  low  NO 3-N  systems  using  a  peristaltic  pump  in  order  to
balance  the  sodium  concentration  and  conductivity  between  treat-
ments.
2.3.  System  description  and  operation
The  replicated  WRAS  used  during  the  present  study  were  pre-
viously described in  detail  (Davidson  et  al.,  2009 ).  To  summarize,
each  WRAS  recirculated  380  L/min  (100  gpm)  of  water  through  a
5.3  m3dual  drain  culture  tank,  a  radial  ﬂow  settler,  a  microscreen
drum  ﬁlter  with  60  /H9262m  screens,  a  ﬂuidized  sand  bioﬁlter,  a  geother-
mal heat  exchanger,  a  carbon  dioxide  stripping  column,  and  a  low
head  oxygenator  (LHO)  (Fig.  1).  A  constant  24-h  photoperiod  was
provided  throughout  the  study.
Ozone  was  applied  to  all  WRAS  seven  weeks  into  the  study
in  order  to  reduce  the  color  of  the  water  so  that  ﬁsh  could  be
more  easily  observed  and  to  facilitate  measurement  of  behav-
ioral  metrics.  Three  ozone  generators  were  used  (Model  G22,
Paciﬁc  Ozone  Technology,  Benicia,  CA,  USA).  Approximately  1–6%
of  the  >99%  pure  oxygen  feed  gas  passing  through  the  Corona
discharge  cell  of  each  generator  was  converted  to  ozone  and
injected  equally  within  each  LHO.  Ozone  was  monitored  and  con-
trolled  via  oxidation  reduction  potential  (ORP),  measured  in  each
culture  tank  just  in  front  of  the  inlet  ﬂow  structure  with  a  dif-
ferential  ORP  digital  sensor  equipped  with  a  platinum  electrode
(Model  DRD1R5,  Hach  Company,  Loveland,  CO,  USA)  and  displayed
by  an  SC100  Universal  Controller  (Hach  Company,  Loveland,  CO,
USA).
2.4. Water  exchange  and  feed  loading  rates
Makeup  water  ﬂow  rates  were  maintained  equally  for  all  WRAS
throughout  the  study.  To  begin,  1.3  L/min  of  makeup  water  was
continuously  added  to  each  pump  sump,  equivalent  to  0.34%  of
the  total  recycle  ﬂow  and  a  5-day  system  hydraulic  retention  time.
Makeup  water ﬂow rates  were  increased  to  all  WRAS  on  three  occa-
sions  as  follows:  2.6,  3.8,  and  5.7  L/min  or  0.69,  1.00,  and  1.51%  of
the  total  recycle  ﬂow;  in  order  to  maintain  maximum  NO 3-N  con-
centrations  for  the  control  treatment  at  ≤40  mg/L  and  to  prevent
the  accumulation  of  other  water  quality  and  ionic  concentrations.
The system hydraulic  retention  times  resulting  from  adjustments
to makeup  water  rates  were  2.5,  1.7,  and  1.2  days,  respectively.32  J.  Davidson  et  al.  /  Aquacultural  Engineering  59  (2014)  30–40

2.5.  Feeding  methods  and  feed  loading
A  standard  slow-sinking  trout  diet  (Zeigler  Brothers,  Inc.,  Gard-
ners,  PA,  USA)  with  a  protein:  fat  ratio  of  42:16  was  used  throughout
the study.  Fish  were  fed  equal  rations  with  feeding  events  occur-
ring  every  other  hour,  around  the  clock,  using  automated  feeders
(T-drum  2000CE,  Arvotec,  Huutokoski,  Finland).  Feeding  was  esti-
mated  based  on  standardized  feeding  charts,  as  well  as  observations
of  feeding  activity  and  wasted  feed.  The  mean  feed  loading  rate
amongst  all  WRAS  over  the  study  duration  was  0.72  kg  daily  feed
per  cubic  meter  daily  makeup  water.
2.6.  Water  quality  sampling  and  analysis
Water  samples  were  collected  weekly  from  the  side  drain  of
each  tank  and  tested  on-site.  Speciﬁc  parameters,  methodologies,
and  frequencies  of  testing  are  outlined  in  Table  1.  All  water  quality
parameters  measured  on-site  were  analyzed  according  to  methods
described  in  APHA,  2005  and  Hach  (2003) .  Water  samples  for  dis-
solved  metals  analysis  were  collected  monthly  and  analyzed  by  the
Cornell  University  Nutrient  Analysis  Lab  (Ithaca,  NY,  USA).
2.7.  Fish  sampling  protocols
Lengths  and  weights  of  a  random  sample  of  70–115  ﬁsh  (exact
number  dependent  upon  the  calculated  sample  size  requirement,
Kitchens,  1998 ),  were  measured  monthly,  including  samples  at  the
beginning  and  end  of  the  study.  Fin  erosion  was  assessed  quali-
tatively  on  a  4-point  scale  (severe,  moderate,  low,  or  no  damage)
for  all  sampled  ﬁsh  during  each  monthly  length/weight  event.  The
prevalence  of  spinal  deformities  (i.e.,  lordosis,  kyphosis,  and/or  sco-
liosis)  was  also  assessed  monthly  for  all  sampled  ﬁsh  through  visual
observation.  Mortalities  were  removed  and  recorded  daily  in  order
to  track  cumulative  survival.  Thermal  growth  coefﬁcients  (TGC)and  feed  conversion  ratios  (FCR)  were  calculated  and  compared
between  treatments  as  follows:
TGC  =End Weight(1/3)−  Start  Weight(1/3)
(Days Between  ×  Avg.  Temp.)  ×  1000
where weight  is  in  grams  and  temperature  is  in◦C.
FCR =Cumulative  Feed Delivered
Fish  Biomass  Gain
At  the  end  of  the  study  period,  ﬁve  ﬁsh  from  each  WRAS  were
randomly  sampled  via  dip-net  collection,  sedated  with  75  mg/L
MS-222  (Western  Chemical  Inc.,  Ferndale,  WA,  USA),  and  bled  via
caudal  venipuncture  using  21.5-guage,  1.5  in.  needles  and  1-ml
syringes.  Whole  blood  samples  were  then  analyzed  on-site  using  an
i-Stat  1  portable  analyzer  (Abbott  Laboratories,  Abbott  Park,  IL,  USA)
with  CG4+  and  CHEM8+  cartridges.  Parameters  assessed  with  the
CG4+  cartridge  included  pH,  pCO 2,  pO 2,  HCO 3,  total  CO 2,  O2satura-
tion,  and  lactate,  while  CHEM8+  cartridges  provided  data  for  whole
blood  sodium,  potassium,  chloride,  calcium,  glucose,  hematocrit,
and  hemoglobin.
For  histopathological  evaluation,  samples  of  gill,  integument,
anterior  and  posterior  kidney,  liver,  heart,  and  spleen  were  col-
lected from  ﬁve  euthanized  (200  mg/L  MS-222)  ﬁsh  per  WRAS
at  the  end  of  the  study  and  preserved  in  histological  grade  10%
formalin  solution  (Fisher  Scientiﬁc,  Pittsburgh,  PA,  USA)  for  one
week  prior  to  processing  and  histopathological  evaluation.  The
evaluating  pathologist  was  blinded  to  the  treatment  group  ori-
gins  of  all  sampled  specimens.  A  zero-to-ﬁve  point  grading  scale
was  developed  to  quantify  the  severity  of  each  lesion  type,  with
0  representing  normal  tissue  and  5  representing  lesions  affecting
essentially  100%  of  the  tissue  examined.J.  Davidson  et  al.  /  Aquacultural  Engineering  59  (2014)  30–40  33

2.8. Swimming behavior  assessment
Over the  course  of  the  study,  the  degree  of  side  swimming  (a
condition  in  which  the  ﬁsh  swims  tilted  on  its  side)  was  assessed
weekly  in  each  WRAS  by  counting  the  number  of  side  swimming
ﬁsh  as  they  passed  a  given  location  in  the  tank.  During  weeks  5–8,
ﬁsh  could  not  be  accurately  counted  due  to  increasing  turbidity
of  the  culture  water.  Ozone  was  applied  to  each  system  during
week  7  to  clear  the  water  and  allow  more  effective  observation  of
ﬁsh  behavior.  Observations  of  swimming  behavior  were  resumed
during  week  9.
At  the  conclusion  of  the  study,  rainbow  trout  within  each  WRAS
were  crowded  and  approximately  50%  of  the  population  from  each
WRAS  (1023  ±  3  ﬁsh)  was  randomly  selected  via  dip-netting  and
transported  to  a  separate,  single-pass  system  with  1.5-m3tanks
that  received  spring  water,  where  side  swimming  ﬁsh  could  be
more  easily  observed,  handled,  and  quantiﬁed.  The  next  day,  all
side  swimming  ﬁsh  were  individually  netted  from  each  1.5  m3tank
and  counted  into  separate  tanks  in  order  to  assess  the  percentage
of  side  swimming  ﬁsh  present  in  each  WRAS  at  the  conclusion  of
the  study.
Over  the  ﬁrst  4  weeks  of  the  study,  general  observations
were  made  regarding  swimming  speed.  Swimming  speed  was
not  measured  from  weeks  1–4  due  to  ﬁsh  orientation  deep  in
the  water  column  and/or  a  lesser  number  of  ﬁsh  swimming
faster  than  the  rotational  velocity  of  the  culture  water.  From
weeks  5–8,  observations  of  swimming  behavior  were  limited
due  to  the  turbidity  of  the  culture  water  (previously  explained
relative  to  side  swimming  observations).  By  week  9  the  water
was  clear  enough  to  begin  an  assessment  of  ﬁsh  swimming
speed,  which  was  carried  out  weekly  thereafter  until  the  con-
clusion  of  the  study.  Swimming  speeds  of  15  ﬁsh  from  each
WRAS  were  measured  weekly.  Culture  tanks  were  gridded  into
four  sections  using  two  lengths  of  PVC  pipe  that  spanned  the
tank  with  markings  distanced  one  inch  apart.  Rainbow  trout
were  observed  from  above  the  tank  using  a  ladder.  Fish  were
allowed 2  min  to  acclimate  to  the  disturbances  caused  by  setup,
prior  to  taking  measurements.  Individual  ﬁsh  were  tracked  using
a  stopwatch  as  they  intersected  a  PVC  grid  that  encompassed
one  quarter  of  the  culture  tank.  In  addition  to  speed,  which
was  timed  with  a  stopwatch,  notation  was  made  relative  to
the  ﬁsh  location,  i.e.  distance  from  the  tank  wall,  as  it  inter-
sected  the  grid.  Incremental  1-in.  markings  on  the  PVC  pipe
facilitated  this  measurement,  which  was  then  used  to  estimate
the  arc  or  distance  of  travel,  needed  to  determine  swimming
speed.  The  water  rotational  velocity  was  added  to  the  calcu-
lated  ﬁsh  swimming  velocity  to  determine  overall  ﬁsh  swimming
speed.Table  2

2.9.  Statistical  analysis
All  parameters  that  were  sampled  during  multiple  events  over
time from the  same  location,  such  as  water  quality  parameters
and  growth  rates  were  analyzed  using  a  Mixed  Models  approach
known as Restricted  Maximum  Likelihood  (REML),  which  allows
the  assignment  of  Tank  as  a  random  effect,  thus  buffering  poten-
tial variation arising  from  individual  culture  system  effects  (Ling
and  Cotter,  2003 ).  Time  was  included  as  a  random  covariate  for
these analyses. Normality  was  assessed  using  a  Shapiro–Wilk  test.
Non-Gaussian  data  were  transformed  for  statistical  comparison.  If
transformation  procedures  did  not  yield  normally  distributed  data
a  non-parametric  Wilcoxon  Mann  Whitney  test  was  employed.
Survival  percentage  data  was  transformed  for  statistical  analysis
using  an  arcsine  square-root  transformation.  Blood  chemistry  data
obtained  from  individual  ﬁsh  were  assessed  statistically  for  treat-
ment  effect  using  analyses  of  covariance,  with  blood  parameter  as
dependent  variable,  treatment  as  independent  variable,  and  tank
(WRAS)  as  forced  covariate.  Histopathological  data  for  each  tis-
sue  type  with  observable  lesions  were  analyzed  using  bivariable
ordered  logistic  regression  models,  with  treatment  (high  or  low
NO 3-N)  as  the  independent  variable  in  each  model  and  speciﬁc
lesion  score  as  the  ordinal  dependent  variable.  Blood  chemistry
and  histopathological  data  were  analyzed  with  STATA  9  software
(StataCorp,  College  Station,  TX,  USA);  all  other  data  analyses  were
carried  out  using  SYSTAT  13  software  (2009).  A  probability  level  of
0.05  was  used  to  determine  signiﬁcance.

thus  trout  size  within  all  WRAS  was  statistically  similar  between
treatments  to  begin  (16.4  ±  0.3  g).  At  the  conclusion  of  the  study,
rainbow  trout  cultured  within  the  high  and  low  NO 3-N  treatments
had  mean  lengths  of  216  ±  1  and  221  ±  2  mm,  respectively;  and
mean  weights  of  181  ±  5  and  189  ±  5  g,  respectively  (Fig.  2).  There
was  no  signiﬁcant  difference  in  mean  length  or  weight  between
treatments over  the  study  duration  (Table  2).  In  addition,  there
was  no  statistical  difference  in  thermal  growth  coefﬁcient  (TGC)
between  treatments,  which  was  2.32  ±  0.05  and  2.34  ±  0.04  for  the
high  and  low  NO 3-N  treatments,  respectively  (Table  2).  Condition
factor  was  also  similar  between  treatments  over  the  study  dura-
tion.  Mean  condition  factor  at  the  conclusion  of  the  study  for  the
high  and  low  NO 3-N  treatments  was  1.70  ±  0.03  and  1.66  ±  0.01,
respectively.  Mean  feed  conversion  ratios  (FCR)  during  the  study
period  for  the  high  and  low  NO 3-N  treatments  were  1.35  ±  0.05
and  1.29  ±  0.03,  respectively.  There  was  no  signiﬁcant  difference  in
FCR  between  treatments.  At  the  conclusion  of  the  study  no  statisti-
cal  differences  existed  for  any  of  the  aforementioned  rainbow  trout
performance  metrics  (Table  2).
3.2. Survival
Rainbow  trout  mortality  began  to  increase  for  the  high  NO 3-
N  treatment  only  1-week  after  treatments  were  initiated  (Fig.  3).
Thereafter,  cumulative  survival  was  consistently  lower  for  the  high
NO 3-N  treatment  for  the  remainder  of  the  study  (Fig.  3).  Over  the
ﬁnal  2–3  weeks  of  the  study  rainbow  trout  mortality  increased  for
both  groups  but  was  more  severe  within  the  high  NO 3-N  treat-
ment  (Fig.  3).  At  the  conclusion  of  the  study,  cumulative  rainbow

and  92.5  ±  1.1%.  Statistical  comparison  of  ﬁnal  survival  percentages
bordered  signiﬁcance  (P  =  0.050).
3.3. Fish  biomass  and  density
Statistical  evaluation  of  growth  did  not  yield  differences
between  treatments  and  a  potential  difference  in  survival  trended
toward  signiﬁcance;  however,  the  combined  effect  of  slightly
slower  growth  and  decreased  survival  for  the  high  NO 3-N  treat-
ment  resulted  in  signiﬁcantly  lower  ﬁsh  biomass  and  density.  Mean
rainbow  trout  biomass  to  conclude  the  study  for  the  high  and  low
NO 3-N  treatments  was  332  ±  6  and  364  ±  9  kg  per  WRAS,  respec-
tively  (P  =  0.031).  Mean  ﬁsh  density  at  the  conclusion  of  the  study
was  64  ±  1  kg/m3within  the  high  NO 3-N  systems  and  70  ±  2  kg/m3
within  the  low  NO 3-N  systems  (P  =  0.035).
3.4.  Fin  erosion  and  spinal  deformities
There  was  no  signiﬁcant  difference  in  the  degree  of  ﬁn  erosion
between  treatments  over  the  duration  of  the  study  for  the  following
ﬁns:  left  pectoral,  right  pectoral,  left  pelvic,  right  pelvic,  and  dorsal.
At the  conclusion  of  the  study,  the  caudal  ﬁn  of  trout  cultured  within
the  low  nitrate  treatment  was  found  to  have  signiﬁcant  greater  ﬁn
erosion  compared  to  trout  cultured  in  the  high  NO 3-N  treatment
(P  =  0.021).  Very  few  spinal  deformities  were  observed  (<1%  during
each  sampling  event)  for  either  treatment  (P  >  0.05).
3.5.  Blood  chemistry
There  were  no  signiﬁcant  differences  between  treatments  for  a
suite of  14  blood  chemistry  parameters  analyzed  from  samples  col-
lected  at  the  conclusion  of  the  study  (Table  3).  However,  chloride
concentrations  for  rainbow  trout  from  the  high  NO 3-N  treatment
were  nondetectable  for  all  15  ﬁsh  sampled;  while  blood  from  the
low  NO 3-N  treatment  ﬁsh  contained  124.4  ±  0.653  mmol/L  chlo-
ride.  Due  to  the  lack  of  numerical  data  for  chloride,  a  statistical
comparison  was  not  possible.  In  addition,  blood  urea  nitrogen
concentrations  for  the  high  and  low  NO 3-N  treated  ﬁsh  were
13.00  ±  1.135  and  10.70  ±  0.857  mg/dL,  respectively  (P  =  0.079).  A
signiﬁcant  difference  was  not  detected  between  treatments  for
blood  urea  nitrogen,  but  it  was  the  only  measured  blood  chemistry
parameter  that  trended  toward  signiﬁcance.
3.6. Histopathology

noted  in  gill  and  kidney  tissue,  and  neither  treatment  groupJ.  Davidson  et  al.  /  Aquacultural  Engineering  59  (2014)  30–40  35

exhibited statistically higher scores (on  the  0–5  point  scale)  for
either
 tissue  pathology.  Observed  gill  pathology  comprised  of  mild
to moderate hyperplasia of the basal  lamellar  and  interlamellar
epithelium, with  occasional  separation  of  the  lamellar  epithelium
from  the subadjacent stroma and  variable  hypertrophy  of  the  mid-
zonal lamellar  epithelial  cells.  Fish  in  the  high  NO 3-N  group  scored
1.53  ±  0.27  for  this  lesion  type,  while  those  examined  from  the
low  NO 3-N  group  scored  1.67  ±  0.27  for  this  lesion  type  (P  =  0.835).
Kidney lesions consisted  of  mild  to  severe  nephrocalcinosis  and
renal  interstitial  ﬁbrosis.  High  NO 3-N  ﬁsh  scored  0.60  ±  0.41  for  this
lesion type, while  the  low  NO 3-N  group  scored  1.00  ±  0.40  for  this
lesion  type  (P  =  0.268).
3.7.  Swimming  behavior
To  begin  the  study  through  week  2,  no  side  swimming  ﬁsh  were
observed  for  the  high  or  low  NO 3-N  treatments  (Fig.  4).  During
week  3  a  few  ﬁsh  began  to  swim  oriented  on  their  sides  for  each
treatment,  i.e.  13  ±  4  and  3  ±  1  ﬁsh  for  the  high  and  low  NO 3-N
treatments,  respectively  (Fig.  4).  Fish  could  not  be  observed  from
weeks  5–8  due  to  turbidity  of  the  culture  water.  When  observations
resumed during  week  9,  the  number  of  side  swimming  ﬁsh  had
increased  for  both  treatments  (Fig.  4).  The  prevalence  of  side  swim-
ming  ﬁsh  was  signiﬁcantly  greater  for  the  high  NO 3-N  treatment
during  every  weekly  assessment  (P  <  0.05).  At  the  conclusion  of  the
study,  over  1000  ﬁsh  from  each  WRAS  were  relocated  to  smaller
tanks  where  side  swimming  ﬁsh  could  be  captured  and  separated
in  order  to  determine  a  percentage  of  the  population  that  exhibited
the  behavior.  Results  indicated  that  11.5  ±  1.1%  of  the  population
exhibited  the  side  swimming  behavior  from  the  high  NO 3-N  treat-
ment  and  3.8  ±  0.7%  of  the  population  exhibited  side  swimming
behavior  from  the  low  NO 3-N  treatment  (P  =  0.006).
Swimming  speed  observations  during  week  1  indicated  that
rainbow  trout  generally  held  position  in  the  water  column  for  both
treatments,  i.e.,  swam  at  a  rate  equivalent  to  the  rotational  velocity
of  the  culture  water,  17.9  ±  0.40  and  17.8  ±  0.36  cm/s  for  the  high
and  low  NO 3-N  treatments,  respectively.  These  initial  swimming
velocities  equated  to  1.76  ±  0.02  and  1.66  ±  0.04  bl/s  (P  =  0.105).
From  weeks  2–4  approximately  2/3  of  the  ﬁsh  in  all  WRAS  tanks
began  to  swim  faster  than  the  rotational  velocity  of  the  culture
tank.  As  previously  mentioned,  observations  were  inhibited  from
weeks  5–8  due  to  increased  turbidity  of  the  culture  water  in  all
WRAS.  The  use  of  ozone,  beginning  at  week  7,  cleared  the  water
and  allowed  swimming  speed  measurements  to  resume  by  week  9.
During  weeks  9  and  10,  signiﬁcantly  greater  swimming  speed  was
measured  for  rainbow  trout  cultured  within  the  high  NO 3-N  treat-
ment (Fig.  5).  During  the  ﬁnal  two  weeks  of  the  study,  there  was
no  signiﬁcant  difference  in  swimming  speed  between  treatments01020304050

(Fig.  5).  Although  rainbow  trout  swimming  speed  was  generally
greater  over  the  majority  of  the  assessment  period,  the  average
swimming  speed  over  the  course  of  the  study  was  not  signiﬁ-
cantly  different,  i.e.,  38.1  ±  0.4  and  36.0  ±  1.2  cm/s  (P  =  0.200),  for
the  high  and  low  NO 3-N  treatments,  respectively.  When  expressed
as  body  lengths/s,  mean  rainbow  trout  swimming  speeds  (week
9–13)  for  the  high  and  low  NO 3-N  treatments  were  2.03  ±  0.07  and
1.87  ±  0.06  bl/s,  respectively  (P  =  0.176).
3.8. Water  quality
The  majority  of  measured  water  quality  parameters  were  suc-
cessfully  controlled  between  treatments  (Table  4).  Signiﬁcant
differences  were  not  detected  for  alkalinity,  biochemical  oxygen
demand,  carbon  dioxide,  color,  conductivity,  dissolved  oxygen,
hardness,  ORP,  pH,  temperature,  total  ammonia  nitrogen,  and
unionized  ammonia  (Table  4).  Of  the  25  dissolved  nutrients
and  elements  that  were  analyzed;  aluminum,  arsenic,  beryllium,
cadmium,  chromium,  cobalt,  iron,  lead,  manganese,  molybde-
num,  nickel,  selenium,  titanium,  and  vanadium  concentrations
were  below  the  minimum  detection  limits  for  both  treatments
(Table  5).  In  addition,  the  following  dissolved  nutrients  and  metals
that existed  at  measureable  concentrations  were  not  signiﬁcantly

Several water  quality  parameters  were  statistically  different  due
to the experimental  design  of  the  study  including:  nitrate  nitrogen,
sulfate, sulfur,  and  sodium  (Tables  4  and  5).  Mean  NO 3-N  con-
centrations for the high  and  low  NO 3-N  treatments  were  91  ±  0
and  30  ±  0,  respectively.  Fig.  6  illustrates  the  NO 3-N  concentrations
established for each  treatment  during  the  study  period.  Maximum
NO 3-N  concentrations  for  the  high  and  low  NO 3-N  treatments  were
110  and  40  mg/L,  respectively.  Sulfate  and  dissolved  sulfur  were
signiﬁcantly  greater  within  the  low  NO 3-N  treatment  due  to  the
addition  of  sodium  sulfate  to  balance  conductivity  between  treat-
ments.  Dissolved  sodium  was  also  signiﬁcantly  greater  within  the
low  NO 3-N  WRAS.
Several  other  water  quality  parameters  were  signiﬁcantly  dif-
ferent  between  treatments.  These  parameters  included  nitrite
nitrogen,  total  suspended  solids,  and  ultraviolet  transmittance;
as  well  as  the  following  dissolved  nutrients  and  metals:  boron,
calcium,  and  potassium  (Tables  4  and  5).  Nitrite  nitrogen,  total
suspended  solids,  boron,  and  potassium  concentrations  were  sig-
niﬁcantly  greater  within  the  high  NO 3-N  treatment.  Ultraviolet
transmittance was  signiﬁcantly  lower  for  the  high  NO 3-N  treat-
ment,  indicating  slightly  greater  turbidity.  Calcium  concentrations
were  also signiﬁcantly greater  for  the  low  NO 3-N  treatment
(Table  5).

 low  NO 3-N  treatments  measured  4–5  times  per  week  (n  =  3).et  al.  (2011a) .  The  most  notable  ﬁnding  from  the  present  study  was
replication  of  the  side  swimming  behavior,  which  was  reported
as  one  of  the  primary  health  and  welfare  effects  in  Davidson
et  al.  (2011a)  for  rainbow  trout  cultured  in  low  water  exchange
WRAS  with  mean  NO 3-N  concentrations  of  99  ±  7  mg/L.  During  the
present  study,  a  signiﬁcantly  greater  percentage  of  rainbow  trout
exhibited  side  swimming  behavior  within  the  high  NO 3-N  treat-
ment  compared  to  the  low  NO 3-N  treatment.  It  is  important  to
note  that  there  were  absolutely  no  side  swimming  rainbow  trout
in  either  treatment  when  the  study  commenced  (Fig.  4).  Therefore,
the  side  swimming  behavior  was  likely  instigated  by  conditions
established  within  the  experimental  tanks.
In  addition  to  side  swimming  behavior,  Davidson  et  al.  (2011a)
measured  rapid  swimming  speeds  in  rainbow  trout  cultured  in
tanks  with  mean  NO 3-N  concentrations  of  approximately  100  mg/L.
Rainbow  trout  cultured  under  these  conditions  swam  faster  than
the  rotational  velocity  of  the  culture  tank,  while  trout  cultured
within  WRAS with a  ten-fold  greater  ﬂushing  rate  and  NO 3-N
concentrations  of  13  ±  0  mg/L  generally  held  position  with  the
rotational velocity of  the  culture  tank  (Davidson  et  al.,  2011a ).
During  the  present  study,  there  was  not  a  signiﬁcant  difference
between treatments in  overall  swimming  speed  calculated  as  a
grand  mean  from  weeks  9–13;  however,  swimming  speed  was  sig-
niﬁcantly greater in  the  high  NO 3-N  WRAS  during  weeks  9  and
10  and  was  generally  greater  for  the  majority  of  swimming  speed
assessments.  Davison  (1997)  concluded  that  swimming  speeds
≤1.5  bl/s  were  optimal  for  growth  and  feed  conversion  and  sug-
gested  that  sustained  swimming  at  speeds  >1.5  bl/s  could  have
negative  impacts  on  ﬁsh.  During  the  ﬁrst  week  of  the  study,  rainbow
trout  swimming  speeds  were  1.76  ±  0.02  and  1.66  ±  0.04  bl/s  for
the  high  and  low  NO 3-N  treatments,  respectively.  These  swimming
speeds  were  slightly  greater  but  close  to  the  recommendations
set  forth  by  Davison  (1997) .  From  weeks  9–13  average  swimming
speeds  increased  to  2.03  ±  0.07  and  1.87  ±  0.06  bl/s  for  the  high
and  low  NO 3-N,  treatments  respectively,  and  therefore  exceeded
the  recommendation  of  ≤1.5  bl/s  (Davison,  1997 ).  Jain  et  al.  (1997)
determined  that  the  “fatigue  swimming  velocity”  for  rainbow  trout
was  2.10  ±  0.06  bl/s.
Although,  the  background  literature  suggests  that  rainbow  trout
from both  treatments  were  swimming  at  potentially  exhaustive
rates,  it  is  clear  that  the  ﬁsh  elected  to  swim  at  increased  speeds
possibly  as  an  effort  to  balance  metabolic  and/or  osmoregulatory
function.  To  maintain  a  constant  position  against  the  rotational
current,  the  ﬁsh  were  forced  to  swim  no  faster  than  the  mean
rotational  velocity  of  the  culture  water,  which  was  18.4  ±  0.2  and
18.3  ±  0.3  cm/s  for  the  high  and  low  NO 3-N  treatments,  respec-
tively;  but  average  swimming  speeds  for  both  treatments  exceeded
36  cm/s  (approximately  two  times  faster  than  the  water  rota-
tional  velocity).  Most  behavioral  responses,  such  as  changes  to  ﬁsh
swimming  behavior,  are  based  on  underlying  physiological  and  bio-
chemical  factors  (Rand,  1985 ).  Gallaugher  et  al.  (2001)  reported  that
high  intensity  exercise  training  potentially  diminished  osomoregu-
latory  compromise  in  Chinook  salmon  (Oncorhynchus  tshawytscha )
and  allowed  the  ﬁsh  to  “multitask  physiological  functions  while
swimming.”
Several swimming  behavior  measurements  from  the  present
study  differed  from  those  described  by  Davidson  et  al.  (2011a) ;
speciﬁcally,  the  increased  prevalence  of  side  swimming  as  well  as
the  rapid  swimming  speeds  measured  in  the  low  NO 3-N  treatment.
The  reason  for  the  occurrence  of  these  behaviors  within  the  low
NO 3-N  treatment  is  unclear,  but  the  authors  offer  several  possi-
ble  explanations:  (1)  The  control  NO 3-N  concentration  (30  mg/L)
possibly  caused  a  mild  toxicity  to  a  small  percentage  of  the  pop-
ulation.  The  control  concentration  used  in  the  present  study  was
more than  two  times  greater  than  that  reported  in  Davidson  et  al.
(2011a) ,  i.e.,  13  ±  0  mg/L  NO 3-N,  for  which  very  few  side  swimmingJ.  Davidson  et  al.  /  Aquacultural  Engineering  59  (2014)  30–40  37
trout  were  observed.  (2)  Rainbow  trout  that  were  evaluated  during
Study  1  of  the  Davidson  et  al.  (2011a)  were  151  ±  3  g  to  begin;  while
trout  used  during  the  present  study  were  16.4  ±  0.3  g.  Therefore,  the
younger  rainbow  trout  used  during  the  present  study  could  have
been  more  susceptible  to  lower  NO 3-N  concentrations.  Sprague
(1985)  reported  that  the  most  sensitive  life  stages  of  ﬁsh  to  toxi-
cants  are  the  embryo-larval  and  early  juvenile  life  stages.  Camargo
et  al.  (2005)  reported  that  nitrate  toxicity  generally  decreases  in
aquatic  species  with  increasing  body  size,  and  noted  that  establish-
ment  of  acute,  chronic,  and  sublethal  NO 3-N  levels  would  certainly
depend  upon  life  stage.  (3)  Other  water  quality  concentrations  per-
haps  interacted  to  cause  a  mild  chronic  effect  to  rainbow  trout  in  the
low  NO 3-N  treatment  systems;  or  sodium  sulfate,  the  compound
used  to  control  conductivity  within  the  low  NO 3-N  treatment  could
have  caused  a  mild  chronic  reaction.  However,  background  liter-
ature  suggests  that  sulfate  concentrations  were  safe  for  rainbow
trout  (Heinen,  1996;  Davies,  2007;  Davies  and  Hall,  2007;  Elphick
et  al., 2011 ).
4.2. Blood chemistry  and  histopathology
The majority of  measured  blood  parameters  were  not  signiﬁ-
cantly  different  between  high  and  low  NO 3-N  treatment  groups
(Table 3),  and  the  values  obtained  were  generally  comparable  to
previously  conducted  on-site  research  (e.g.  Good  et  al.,  2009 )  using
the  i-Stat  1.  The  use  of  point-of-care  instruments,  such  as  the
i-Stat  1,  is  becoming  a  more  frequent  approach  in  published  stud-
ies  evaluating  animal  blood  parameters;  however,  the  accuracy
of  results  obtained  from  such  instruments,  compared  to  values
generated  through  conventional  laboratory  methodologies,  has
been  questioned  (DiMaggio  et  al.,  2010 ).  As  published  reference
ranges  for  blood  chemistry  parameters  in  ﬁsh  (e.g.  Wedemeyer
and  Chatterton,  1970;  Stoskopf,  1993;  Wedemeyer,  1996 )  have
been  derived  from  data  obtained  through  conventional  laboratory
methodologies,  it  is  often  difﬁcult  to  directly  compare  results  from
point-of-care  instruments  to  these  published  values.  Employing
instruments  such  as  the  i-Stat  1  in  aquatic  research  studies,  how-
ever,  can  still  be  extremely  useful,  particularly  when  comparing
results  from  two  or  more  treatment  groups,  and  other  situations
in which  instrument  precision  is  more  important  than  its  accuracy
relative  to  traditional  laboratory  approaches.
The  most  striking  difference  between  the  two  treatments  was
in  chloride  concentration,  for  which  all  ﬁfteen  ﬁsh  sampled  in
the  high  NO 3-N  group  had  values  outside  the  i-Stat  1’s  detection
range  (65  and  140  mmol/L),  while  all  15  ﬁsh  in  the  low  NO 3-
N  group  had  expected  values  for  whole  blood  chloride.  Whether
chloride  concentrations  in  the  high  NO 3-N  group  were  above  or
below  instrument  detection  range  cannot  be  determined.  Hrubec
(1996) ,  however,  reported  reductions  in  plasma  chloride  in  hybrid
striped  bass  exposed  to  high  NO 3-N  administered  as  various  salts
(NaNO 3,  CaNO 3,  KNO 3),  and  furthermore  the  observed  reduction
in  plasma  chloride  in  NaNO 3treated  ﬁsh  was  profound  compared
to  those  exposed  to  CaNO 3or  KNO 3.  The  study  by  Hrubec  (1996)
provides  evidence  that  NaNO 3can  drastically  reduce  plasma  chlo-
ride  without  major  effects  on  other  blood  electrolytes  (as  was
observed  during  the  present  study),  and  it  is  therefore  likely  that
the  high  NO 3-N  group  had  whole  blood  chloride  concentrations
below  the  i-Stat  1  detection  limits  (i.e.,  <65  mmol/L).  The  reasons
for  NO 3-N’s  association  with  reduced  chloride  concentration,  and
in  particular  for  the  relatively  severe  reduction  in  plasma  chlo-
ride  associated  with  NaNO 3,  remain  unclear  and  warrant  further
investigation.  Reduced  plasma  chloride  is  often  considered  a  phys-
iological  consequence  of  stress  in  ﬁsh,  which  lose  chloride  ions
to  the  water  as  gill  epithelial  cells  become  more  permeable  with
increased blood  pressure  (Wedemeyer,  1996 ).  However,  as  no  other
blood  parameters  that  are  typically  inﬂuenced  by  stress  (e.g.  otherelectrolytes,  glucose,  and  lactate)  showed  signiﬁcant  differences
between  treatment  groups  during  the  present  study,  it  is  unlikely
that  the  theorized  marked  reduction  in  chloride  concentration  in
the  high  NO 3-N  group  was  due  to  short-  or  long-term  stress.  This
is  in  agreement  with  Hrubec  (1996)  and  Hamlin  (2007) ,  who  did
not  observe  increased  plasma  glucose  and  cortisol  levels  in  hybrid
striped  bass  or  Siberian  sturgeon  (Acipenser  baeri ),  respectively,
when  exposed  to  elevated  NO 3-N.
Although  the  difference  bordered  signiﬁcance,  discussion  is
warranted  regarding  blood  urea  nitrogen  (BUN)  concentrations,
which  were  higher  (P  =  0.079)  in  ﬁsh  from  the  high  NO 3-N  group.
In  a  previous  study  conducted  on-site  using  the  same  experimen-
tal  WRAS,  Good  et  al.  (2009)  reported  increasing  BUN  levels  for
juvenile  rainbow  trout  (133  grams  to  begin)  relative  to  decreasing
system  water  exchange.  Rainbow  trout  cultured  within  a  ﬂow
through  system,  a  high  exchange  WRAS,  and  a  low  exchange  WRAS
had  BUN  concentrations  of  <2.0,  15.9  ±  0.62,  and  19.0  ±  0.80  mg/dL,
respectively  (Good et  al.,  2009 ).  Corresponding  NO 3-N  levels  in
the  culture  water  in  the  high  exchange,  low  exchange,  and  ﬂow
through systems were  <3,  12  ±  0,  and  70  ±  4  mg/L  (Good  et  al.,
2009 ).  Therefore,  there  appears  to  be  an  association  between  BUN
concentrations in rainbow  trout  and  the  NO 3-N  concentration  of
the  culture  water.  Elevated  blood  urea  nitrogen  levels  are  thought
to be related  to  liver  and/or  gill  damage  or  dysfunction  due  to  the
capacity  of  these  organs  to  produce  and  excrete  urea,  respectively
(Stoskopf,  1993 ).  Mensinger  et  al.  (2005)  reported  that  increas-
ing  BUN  is  a  likely  indicator  of  failing  gill  osmoregulatory  function
and  noted  that  increased  BUN  was  correlated  with  ﬁsh  that  had
compromised  health  or  were  terminally  ill.  Among  the  organs  eval-
uated  through  histopathology  (gill,  skin,  heart,  liver,  spleen,  and
kidney),  only  gill  and  kidney  tissue  demonstrated  noticeable,  albeit
predominantly  mild  damage,  and  furthermore  no  signiﬁcant  dif-
ferences  in  the  extent  and  severity  of  observed  lesions  were  noted
between  treatments.  The  observation  of  mild  gill  lesions  is  inter-
esting  due  to  the  association  of  gill  dysfunction  with  increased  BUN
(Mensinger  et  al.,  2005 ),  as  well  as  the  potential  respiratory  advan-
tages  gained  by  increased  swimming  speeds.  However,  the  severity
of  gill  lesions  was  similar  between  treatment  groups  which  con-
founds  any  assumption  that  mild  gill  lesions  and  increased  BUN
were in  some  way  related.  Therefore,  based  on  the  blood  chemistry
results  of  the  present  study,  it  is  unknown  whether  organ  dysfunc-
tion  in  the  absence  of  signiﬁcant  observable  pathology  was  related
to  elevated  BUN.
The  mechanisms  of  nitrate  uptake  in  ﬁsh  are  not  fully  under-
stood.  Camargo  et  al.  (2005)  reported  that  uptake  of  nitrate  in
ﬁsh  is  passive  and  that  gills  have  a  low  branchial  permeability  for
nitrate.  The  theory  of  passive  uptake  and  low  branchial  permeabil-
ity  has  been  used  as  an  explanation  for  the  potentially  low  afﬁnity
of  nitrate  to  cause  toxicity  compared  to  other  nitrogenous  wastes
(Camargo  et  al.,  2005 ).  Stormer  et  al.  (1996)  suggested  that  nitrate
ions  within  the  blood  plasma  of  rainbow  trout  ﬁngerlings  remained
below  the  ambient  concentration  (14  mg/L  NO 3-N)  after  8  days
of  exposure,  indicating  that  nitrate  ions  were  taken  up  passively.
However,  Schram  et  al.  (2012)  found  that  blood  plasma  nitrate
increased  almost  linearly  with  the  concentration  of  the  culture
water  in  juvenile  African  catﬁsh  even  though  the  ratio  of  plasma
nitrate  to  waterborne  nitrate  was  relatively  low,  i.e.  0.15–0.25.
Therefore,  the  theory  of  passive  uptake  of  nitrate  in  freshwater  ﬁsh
is  reasonable;  but  nonetheless  uptake  of  nitrate  does  occur,  sug-
gesting  that  prolonged  exposure  times  that  are  common  within
low  exchange  WRAS  might  lead  to  longer  term  toxic  effects.
Another  reported  hematological  effect  of  exposure  of  ﬁsh  to
excess  nitrate  is  the  conversion  of  hemoglobin  to  methemoglobin,
and  the  resultant  inhibition  of  oxygen  binding  and  transport  within
the blood  (Camargo  et  al.,  2005 ),  similar  to  the  effect  of  nitrite.
Several  papers  have  also  suggested  the  in  vivo  conversion  of38  J.  Davidson  et  al.  /  Aquacultural  Engineering  59  (2014)  30–40
nitrate  ions  to  the  more  toxic  nitrite  ion,  but  these  articles  were
not  speciﬁc  to  aquatic  species  (Walker,  1996;  Panesar  and  Chen,
2000 ).  In  the  present  study,  hemoglobin  levels  were  not  signif-
icantly  different  between  the  high  and  low  NO 3-N  treatments.
There  was  no  evidence  of  methemoglobinemia,  as  hemoglobin  con-
centrations  for  both  treatments  were  actually  elevated  and  above
the  range  reported  as  normal  in  rainbow  trout,  8.9–15.9  mmol/L
(Wedemeyer,  1996 ).  Davison  (1997)  reported  that  exercise  train-
ing  increases  hematocrit  and  thus  hemoglobin  concentration  in  the
blood;  thus  the  elevated  hemoglobin  concentrations  measured  for
both  treatments  were  likely  related  to  continuous  exercise  and  the
rapid  swimming  speeds  observed.
4.3.  Growth,  survival,  and  biomass
Despite  the  increased  prevalence  of  side  swimming  behavior
and  slightly  increased  swimming  velocity  in  the  high  NO 3-N  WRAS,
rainbow  trout growth rates  were  not  signiﬁcantly  different  com-
pared  to  the  low  NO 3-N  treatment.  These  results  were  similar  to
Study 1 of  Davidson  et  al.  (2011a,  2011b)  which  also  indicated  sta-
tistically  similar  growth  rates  of  rainbow  trout  amongst  various
NO 3-N  exposures.  Typically,  a  negative  impact  to  ﬁsh  growth  would
qualify  as  a  tertiary  stress  response  that  is  indicative  of  excessive
utilization of energy  reserves  to  physiologically  compensate  for  an
environmental  stressor  or  toxicant  (Jobling,  1995 ).  In  the  present
study,  blood  chemistry  results  did  not  provide  substantial  evidence
of  even  a  secondary  stress  response;  which  is  qualiﬁed  by  hyper-
glycemia,  osmotic  imbalance  leading  to  loss  of  electrolytes,  and
other  blood  chemistry  indicators  such  as  decreased  chloride  and
sodium  concentrations  (Jobling,  1995;  Wedemeyer,  1996 ).  There-
fore,  a  lack  of  impact  to  rainbow  trout  growth  by  the  experimental
conditions  is  not  surprising.
Davidson  et  al.  (2011a,  2011b)  reported  no  difference  in
rainbow  trout  survival  between  WRAS  operated  at  high  and
low  water  exchange  with  mean  NO 3-N  concentrations  of  13  ±  0
and  99  ±  7  mg/L,  respectively.  Corresponding  survival  rates  dur-
ing  the  Davidson  et  al.  (2011a,  2011b)  study  were  93.1  ±  0.5
and  93.3  ±  1.6%,  respectively.  However,  during  the  present  study,
cumulative  rainbow  trout  survival  appeared  to  be  negatively
impacted by  the  high  NO 3-N  treatment  at  mean  concentrations  of
91  ±  0  mg/L  (Fig.  3).  Statistical  analysis  was  not  completely  conclu-
sive  because  the  resultant  P-value  was  0.05,  but  a  clear  separation  in
survival  between  treatments  was  evident  as  the  study  progressed
(Fig.  3).  The  resulting  survival  percentage  for  the  low  NO 3-N  treat-
ment,  92.5  ±  1.1%  was  similar  to  that  of  Davidson  et  al.  (2011a,
2011b)  for  trout  cultured  at  13  mg/L  NO 3-N.  Decreased  survival
was  not  noted  for  trout  cultured  at  approximately  100  mg/L  during
Davidson  et  al.  (2011a,  2011b) ,  but  ﬁsh  age/size  varied  between
studies,  which  could  have  caused  a  slightly  different  response
(Sprague,  1985;  Camargo  et  al.,  2005 ).  Sprague  (1985)  noted  that
when  toxicity  studies  are  repeated,  results  may  not  correspond
precisely  due  to  individual  variation  of  resistance  within  a  group
of  organisms.  In  addition,  differences  in  toxic  responses  between
cohorts  of  the  same  species  to  similar  concentrations  of  NO 3-N
have  been  reported  (Sprague,  1985;  Hamlin,  2007 ,  Pedersen  et  al.,
2012 ).  For  example,  Pedersen  et  al.  (2012)  did  not  observe  neg-
ative  impacts  to  rainbow  trout  survival  or  swimming  behavior
when  exposing  trout  to  NO 3-N  concentrations  of  approximately
50–200  mg/L.  The  reason(s)  for  conﬂicting  results  between  the
present  study  and  Pedersen  et  al.  (2012)  are  unclear.  Many  dif-
ferences  existed  between  respective  studies  including:  rainbow
trout  genetics  (North  American  vs.  Danish  strain),  initial  rain-
bow  trout  size  (16  vs.  150  g),  feeding  regime  (24  vs.  6  h),  feed
composition–protein/fat  ratio  (42/16  vs.  44/30),  tank  hydraulics
(continuous rotational  velocity  vs.  relatively  low  velocity),  and  ﬁsh
exercise  (forced  continuous  swimming  at  maximum  speeds  vs.relatively  low  exercise  training).  Variables  such  as  tank  size  and
shape,  hydraulics,  and  degree  of  ﬁsh  exercise  (Jobling,  1995 )  could
partly  account  for  differences  in  swimming  behavior  observed  in
each  study.
The  combined  effect  of  slightly  (but  not  signiﬁcantly)  lower
mean  weight  and  reduced  survival  for  rainbow  trout  cultured
within  the  high  NO 3-N  treatment  resulted  in  signiﬁcantly  reduced
end  biomass.  Reduced  biomass,  no  matter  the  mechanism,  is  a  neg-
ative  constraint  to  a  private  venture  ﬁsh  farmer  and  equates  to
decreased  proﬁtability.  Thus,  although  the  performance  effects  of
the  high  NO 3-N  treatment  were  not  dramatic,  they  would  likely  be
signiﬁcant  enough  to  impact  outcomes  at  a  ﬁsh  farm.  With  knowl-
edge  of  the  results  of  the  present  study,  a  commercial  trout  farmer
would  likely  choose  to  operate  his  WRAS  with  either  a  denitriﬁca-
tion  process  or  enough  water  exchange  to  limit  the  accumulation
of  nitrate  nitrogen  below  levels  used  in  the  high  NO 3-N  treatment.
4.4.  Water quality
In order to  diminish  the  effects  of  other  potential  accumulat-
ing  toxicants,  WRAS  were  operated  at  feed  loading  rates  that  were
approximately four times  lower  than  the  Davidson  et  al.  (2011b)
study,  i.e.  1.3  kg  feed/m3daily  makeup  ﬂow  (present  study)  vs.
4.1 kg feed/m3daily  makeup  ﬂow  (Davidson  et  al.,  2011b ).  Thus,
concentrations  of  parameters  such  as  dissolved  copper  and  potas-
sium,  which  could  not  be  ruled  out  as  potentially  toxic  by  Davidson
et  al.  (2011a) ,  were  substantially  diluted  in  the  present  study
and  therefore  unlikely  to  cause  negative  impacts  to  rainbow  trout
health  and  welfare.  Although  the  majority  of  water  quality  param-
eters  were  controlled  between  treatments,  the  authors  found  it
impossible  to  control  for  every  measured  water  quality  parameter.
For  example,  by  attempting  to  balance  conductivity  and  alkalin-
ity  between  treatments  through  the  addition  of  sodium  sulfate
and  sodium  bicarbonate,  the  concentrations  of  other  water  quality
parameters  such  as  sulfate,  dissolved  sulfur,  and  dissolved  sodium
became  statistically  different  between  the  high  and  low  NO 3-N
treatments.  In  addition,  several  other  water  quality  parameters
existed  at  signiﬁcantly  different  levels  between  treatments  most
likely  due  to  trace  amounts  present  within  chemical  additives  or
indirect impacts  of  the  treatment  on  the  bacterial  ecology  of  the
WRAS.
For  example,  nitrite  nitrogen  was  signiﬁcantly  greater  within
the  high  NO 3-N  treatment,  i.e.,  0.091  ±  0.012  mg/L  compared  to
0.021  ±  0.002  mg/L  within  the  low  NO 3-N  treatment,  most  likely
due  to  passive  denitriﬁcation  and  back  conversion  of  nitrate
to  nitrite.  Although  the  nitrite  nitrogen  concentrations  were
signiﬁcantly  greater  within  the  high  NO 3-N  systems,  mean  concen-
trations  were  below  levels  that  have  been  implicated  as  causing
toxicity.  Wedemeyer  (1996)  reported  that  nitrite  can  be  toxic
to  rainbow  trout  at  levels  >0.2–0.4  mg/L.  On-site  observations  of
nitrite  nitrogen  toxicity  to  rainbow  trout  during  bioﬁlter  acclima-
tion  have  indicated  that  rainbow  trout  do  not  exhibit  brown  blood
disease  until  concentrations  reach  0.8  mg/L  or  greater.  Buffered
toxicity  of  nitrite  is  associated  with  calcium  and  chloride  concen-
trations  of  the  culture  water,  as  well  as  pH  levels  (Wedemeyer  and
Yasutake,  1978;  Wedemeyer,  1996 ).  Chloride  and  calcium  concen-
trations  of  the  high  alkalinity  spring  water  used  on-site  as  makeup
are  substantial  and  pH  is  controlled  via  automation,  thus  water
quality  buffering  is  enhanced.  During  the  present  study,  blood
hemoglobin  concentrations  for  both  treatments  were  measured  at
levels  above  the  normal  range  for  rainbow  trout;  therefore,  there
was  no  evidence  of  a  toxic  effect  of  nitrite.
In  addition,  total  suspended  solids  concentrations  were  sig-
niﬁcantly  greater  within  the  high  NO 3-N  treatment,  i.e.  6.6  ±  1.1
versus 4.3  ±  0.7  mg/L  in  the  low  NO 3-N  treatment.  Ultraviolet  trans-
mittance  (UVT)  was  signiﬁcantly  lower  within  the  high  NO 3-NJ.  Davidson  et  al.  /  Aquacultural  Engineering  59  (2014)  30–40  39
treatment,  reﬂecting  the  decreased  water  clarity  related  to  TSS.
Davidson  et  al.  (2009)  provided  an  overview  regarding  recom-
mended  limits  for  suspended  solids,  but  ultimately  little  speciﬁc
information  is  available.  The  levels  measured  during  the  present
study  were  within  a  similar  range  as  other  on-site  studies  in  which
no  negative  impacts  were  observed  (Davidson  et  al.,  2009,  2011a,
2011b );  and  the  discrepancy  between  treatments  was  minimal
(Table  4).  Therefore,  negative  impacts  to  ﬁsh  performance,  health,
and  welfare  related  to  TSS  were  unlikely.
Dissolved  potassium  was  also  found  to  be  signiﬁcantly  greater
within  the  high  NO 3-N  treatment.  Potassium  concentrations  for
both  the  high  and  low  NO 3-N  treatments  were  limited  because  the
WRAS  were  operated  at  increased  ﬂushing  rates  and  substantially
lower  feed  loading  rates  that  were  3–4  times  lower  than  previous
studies  (Davidson  et  al.,  2011a,  2011b ).  Potassium  concentrations
measured  during  the  present  study  were  similar  to  those  within
WRAS  in  which  no  ill  effects  were  observed  during  previous  stud-
ies  (Davidson et  al.,  2011a,  2011b ).  In  addition  the  discrepancy  in
dissolved  potassium  concentration  between  treatments  was  less
than 4 mg/L  (Table  5)  and  thus  would  not  be  expected  to  illicit
measurable  differences  in  performance,  health,  and  welfare.  Thus,
dissolved potassium was  also  an  unlikely  contributor  to  the  chronic
effects  to  rainbow  trout  observed  during  the  present  study.
The only other  parameter  that  existed  at  a  signiﬁcantly  greater
concentration  within  the  high  NO 3-N  treatment  was  boron.
Lowengart  (2001)  cited  normal  rainbow  trout  survival  and  repro-
duction  in  natural  waters  containing  up  to  1  mg/L  of  boron.  Boron
concentrations  within  the  high  NO 3-N  treatment  were  much  lower,
0.047  ±  0.001  mg/L,  and  therefore  should  not  have  been  problem-
atic.
The  concentrations  of  several  water  quality  parameters  (dis-
solved  sulfur,  sulfate,  and  sodium)  were  found  to  exist  at
signiﬁcantly  greater  concentrations  within  the  low  NO 3-N  treat-
ment.  Discussion  of  these  parameters  and  their  potential  toxicity
is  warranted  due  to  the  unexplained  incidence  of  side  swimming
and  rapid  swimming  speed  in  the  control  treatment.  Increased  con-
centrations  of  dissolved  sulfur,  sulfate,  and  sodium  were  related  to
dosing  sodium  sulfate  within  the  low  NO 3-N  WRAS  to  control  ionic
conductivity  between  treatments.  Davies  and  Hall  (2007)  deter-
mined an  LC50for  sodium  sulfate  for  lower  freshwater  aquatic
organisms,  Daphnia  magna  and  Hyella  azteca ,  of  5269  mg/L  at
250  mg/L  hardness  as  CaCO 3and  3203  mg/L  at  100  mg/L  hard-
ness  as  CaCO 3,  respectively .Each  of  these  studies  linked  increasing
water  hardness  to  a  corresponding  increase  in  LC50concentration
for  sulfate.  Elphick  et  al.  (2011)  determined  a  10-day  EC10sul-
fate  concentration  of  356  mg/L  in  soft  water  (15  mg/L  hardness  as
CaCO 3)  for  early  life  stage  rainbow  trout  and  also  linked  increas-
ing  hardness  levels  to  decreased  sulfate  toxicity.  An  EC10is  the
effective  concentration  that  will  have  a  negative  effect  (not  nec-
essarily  a  lethal  effect)  on  10%  of  the  population.  Based  on  the
aforementioned  literature  sources,  the  hardness  levels  measured
during  the  present  study  (>300  mg/L;  Table  4)  were  substantial
and  likely  provided  a  buffering  effect  to  sulfate  and  other  ionic
toxicities.  In  addition,  Heinen  (1996)  suggested  that  rainbow  trout
survival  would  not  be  impacted  at  sulfate  concentrations  from  850
to  950  mg/L.  The  average  sulfate  concentration  measured  within
the  low  NO 3-N  treatment  was  262  ±  2  mg/L.  Based  on  current  liter-
ature;  it  is  unlikely  that  the  sulfate  concentrations  that  accumulated
within  the  low  NO 3-N  treatment  caused  any  adverse  effect  to  rain-
bow  trout.
Sodium  and  dissolved  sulfur  were  also  detected  at  signiﬁcantly
greater  concentrations  within  the  low  NO 3-N  WRAS.  Increased  con-
centrations  of  sodium  and  sulfur  were  related  to  addition  of  sodium
sulfate  to  control  the  ionic  conductivity  between  treatments.
These parameters  are  generally  considered  as  being  innocuous  to
salmonid  species.  In  fact,  increasing  sodium  concentration  has  beencited  as  a  means  to  reduce  the  toxicity  of  some  water  quality  param-
eters  such  as  unionized  ammonia  (Colt,  2006 ).  In  general,  very
little  research  is  available  that  evaluates  the  potential  toxicity  of
sodium  or  sulfur  in  only  the  dissolved  elemental  form.  While  it  was
unlikely  that  increased  sodium  and  sulfur  concentrations  elicited
any  adverse  effects  to  ﬁsh  within  the  low  NO 3-N  treatment,  further
investigation  of  these  elements  as  potential  toxicants  to  rainbow
trout  would  be  useful.
Lastly,  calcium  existed  at  a  signiﬁcantly  greater  concentration
within  the  low  NO 3-N  treatment,  118  ±  0  mg/L  vs.  114  ±  0  mg/L
within  the  high  NO 3-N  treatment  (Table  5).  Recommended  lim-
its  for  calcium  for  rainbow  trout  culture  range  from  4  to  160  mg/L
(Heinen,  1996;  Piper  et  al.,  1982 ).  Thus,  the  concentrations  mea-
sured  during  the  present  study  were  within  recommended  safe
limits.  In  addition,  the  difference  between  treatments  was  only
4  mg/L.
5. Conclusion
Although  most  water  quality  variables  were  controlled  during
the present study, unexpected differences between  treatments  for
the
 concentrations  of  several  water  quality  parameters  inhibited
deﬁnitive conclusions regarding the effect of  nitrate  nitrogen.
Nonetheless,
 toxicity  of  the  potentially  confounding  parameters
was unlikely, as  supported  by  data  from  past  on-site  studies  and
other  literature.  Therefore,  results  from  the  present  study  provide
strong evidence that NO 3-N  concentrations  of  80–100  mg/L  were  at
least partly  responsible  for  the  measured  chronic  effects  to  rainbow
trout under the  described  rearing  conditions.
As  recirculating  aquaculture  systems  are  designed  and  imple-
mented for  various  species,  establishment  of  water  quality
thresholds  should  be  based  on  known  effects  to  cultured  species.
Development  of  such  water  quality  limits  is  challenging  because
these  thresholds  reﬂect  concentrations  that  are  at  the  bottom  range
of  toxicity  where  only  mild  effects  to  cultured  species  begin  to
occur.  The  present  study  likely  elucidated  the  mild/chronic  effects
of  relatively  low  NO 3-N  to  rainbow  trout  such  as  changes  in  swim-
ming  behavior,  as  well  as  slightly  decreased  survival  and  reduced
total  biomass.  Based  on  these  ﬁndings,  the  authors  currently  rec-
ommend  75  mg/L  NO 3-N  as  the  upper  design  limit  for  water
recirculating  aquaculture  systems  used  for  rainbow  trout  culture.
Additional  research  to  evaluate  NO 3-N  concentrations  <75  mg/L
and  >100  mg/L  would  be  helpful  in  ﬁne  tuning  the  NO 3-N  design
threshold  for  recirculating  aquaculture  systems  used  for  rainbow
trout  production  at  various  life  stages.
