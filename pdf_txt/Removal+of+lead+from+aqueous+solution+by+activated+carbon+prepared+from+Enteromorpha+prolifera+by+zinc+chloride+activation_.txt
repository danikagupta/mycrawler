ABSTRACT
In the nuclear ﬁeld, the availability of effective techniques to eliminate lead pollution from wastewater is of interest both 
for the purposes of radiation protection from the radioactive isotope lead-210 and also for the issues related to the use of 
lead in the new generation reactors nowadays under study. Evidences exist of lead pollution due to the radioactive iso-
tope lead-210 in the proximities of uranium extraction mines. In this study, two commercial granular activated carbons 
obtained by physical activation of coconut shell, speciﬁcally developed and selected to purify potable water from dissolved 
organics (GCN 1240) and for use in gold recovery systems (GCN 816 G), were studied in batch systems to evaluate their 
effectiveness for separation of lead (II) from aqueous solutions. A characterization of the two carbons, different in particle 
size, is provided through determination of their pH PZC and scanning electron microscope analysis. Adsorption of lead (II) 
was observed as a func-tion of contact time, and its kinetics were ﬁtted. Adsorption data at equilibrium were ﬁtted by 
isotherm models and the maximum adsorption capacity of the carbons resulted to be 92.39 mg/g (GCN1240) and 32.08 
mg/g (GCN 816 G). Experiments were carried out to investigate effects of pH on lead adsorption, evidencing that best 
removal performances of lead occur near pH 5.0. The  present study shows that the considered commercial granular 
activated carbons can be successfully adopted for removal of lead (II) by adsorption from aqueous solutions.

1. Introduction
Heavy metal pollution represents a relevant threat
for living organisms. Unlike organic pollutants subject
to biological degradation, heavy metal ions tend toaccumulate in living organisms, potentially leading todiseases [ 1–4]. Heavy metals mostly considered as
potentially toxic for living beings are zinc, cadmium,chromium, copper, mercury, nickel, and lead [ 5]. Lead
poisoning, in particular, may be cause of troubles tokidneys, liver, reproductive system, brain, and centralnervous system for human beings [ 6]; it can likewise
become source of diseases such as anemia,

behavioral disorders have been also observed in 
children subject to lead poisoning [8].
Lead poisoning can occur basically through 
inhalation and swallowing. Inhalation mainly involves 
workers of industries characterized by long exposures to 
steams, smokes, and dusts such as metallurgic pro-
cesses, welding, production of batteries, munitions, 
pigments, plastic manufactures, and antiradiation 
screens [9]. Swallowing is mainly connected to the 
presence of the pollutant in waters, nowadays consid-
ered as the main vector of intoxication for human beings 
[10,11], but it may result dangerous even to aquatic ﬂora 
and fauna. Lead contamination in waters and 
wastewaters derives from many types of industry such 
as electroplating, metal plating, batteries, mining, and 
tanneries [12]. Other anthropogenic sources of lead 
pollution include processing and manufacturing of lead 
products and coal combustion [13].
The problem of lead polluted wastewaters is of 
interest also in the nuclear ﬁeld, both for radioprotec-
tion concerning the radioactive isotope lead-210 and for 
toxicity aspects related to the use of lead in the nuclear 
industry. Signiﬁcant evidences exist of lead pollution 
due to the radioactive isotope lead-210 (mostly β− 
emitter, T1/2 = 22.2  years) in waters in the proximities of 
uranium extraction mines; lead-210 is among the most 
radiotoxic elements emitted by coal combustion; further, 
lead-210 can be found in those materials known as 
normally occurring radioactive materials (NORM), such 
as wastes of phosphoric acid production plants, 
phosphate fertilizers, and zircon sands, used in the pro-
duction of refractory materials and as well as in ceramic 
industry. In the nuclear industry, the need for effective 
lead removal from wastewaters arises from operational 
activities and/or accidental events involving the heat 
exchangers of Generation IV lead-cooled fast reactors, 
currently under study.
Lead can be found in water as Pb2+ ions and in 
mineral or organic–mineral complexes. Diseases have 
been demonstrated to arise at lead concentrations 
between 0.01  and 5.0 mg/L [14].
Due to its toxicity, stringent constraints are imposed 
on lead concentration in industrial wastewaters, in 
waters for agricultural and recreational employments 
as well as in drinking water.
At present, the maximum allowable concentration 
of lead in drinking water has been set by United 
States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to 
0.015 mg/L [15]; concerning industrial wastewaters, 
the limit established by USEPA is less strict and equal 
to 0.05  mg/L [16].
To respect limits of lead concentrations, effective 
techniques for lead  removal from waters must bestudied and implemented; this need has encouraged a 
large interest in developing treatment processes such 
as chemical precipitation, electrochemical reduction, 
ion exchange, reverse osmosis, membrane separation, 
biosorption, and adsorption [17–22].
Adsorption is among the most promising processes 
to purify waters containing heavy metals in traces (ppm 
or ppb) and in case of limited ﬂow rates [23–28]: in these 
conditions adsorption is the best choice for lead removal 
because of its chemical stability, high efﬁciency, high 
selectivity, facility of employment, wide range  of 
available adsorbents, and economic fea-sibility. Many 
studies demonstrate that efﬁcient removal of lead traces 
can be achieved, making use of activated carbons 
prepared from a wide range of raw materials. Activated 
carbon is also particularly suitable for radioactive 
isotopes removal thanks to its radiation and thermal 
stability.
Agricultural byproducts of lignocelluloses materials 
constitute the main sources in the production of 
commercial activated carbons: many literature studies 
exist that investigate the adsorption performances of 
carbons prepared from raw material such as coconut 
shells [12,29–33], peanut shells [34,35], hazelnut shells 
[3], nutshells [36], palm shells [37], rice straw [38], and 
bagasse [39].
Moreover, several studies have been carried out on 
activated carbons prepared from exotic plants such as 
Enteromorpha prolifera [22], Polygonum orientale [17], 
Tamarind wood [13], Ceiba pentandra hulls [40], Firmi-
nana simplex [41], and Eichhornia [42]; these sources, 
although representing important case studies in the ﬁeld 
of carbons activation methods, may encounter some 
difﬁculties in giving stable and reproducible adsorption 
results for a commercial utilization.
Lastly, few literature studies about adsorption per-
formances of activated carbons obtained from raw 
materials of mineral origin also exist: Indonesian peat 
[43], peat [44], black carbon [45], and brown coal [46]. 
Some of the literature studies above cited compared 
adsorption performances of activated carbon “as it is” 
and activated carbon with improved surface chemical 
functionality: surface treatments with oxidizing agents 
(namely H2O2 and HNO 3) were found to give a more 
hydrophilic carbon surface, resulting in a greater 
chemical afﬁnity toward adsorbate particles [12]; for 
instance, some positive effects on lead adsorption have 
been shown when treating carbons surface with Na2S, 
because of a good chemical afﬁnity between heavy 
metals and sulﬁdes [24].
The inﬂuence of carbon mass and shaking time on 
lead adsorption was also studied [42]: removal increases 
with the mass of activated carbon up to a saturation 
plateau; lead removal in laboratory batch
mode experiments increases with shaking time up to a 
limit value. Temperature effects on adsorption of lead 
were also investigated [22]: adsorption capacity 
increases with temperature, thanks to a higher diffu-
sion rate of lead ions toward the limit stratum of the 
adsorbent.
In the present study, adsorption of lead onto two 
commercially available granular activated carbons, 
prepared by physical activation of coconut shells, was 
investigated in batch experiments as a function of 
contact time and solution pH; kinetics and equilib-rium 
adsorption isotherms were analyzed to obtain Langmuir 
and Freundlich constants; adsorption as a function of 
initial lead concentration and of the dispersed mass of 
activated carbon was then studied. Activated carbons 
obtained from coconut shell repre-sent an interesting 
ﬁeld of study thanks to their high density, high purity, 
and low ash content [47]. In particular, the two carbons 
here studied have been developed and selected to purify 
potable water from dissolved organics (GCN1240) and 
for use in gold recovery systems (GCN  816 G), but their 
adsorption properties for lead were not been 
investigated so far.
In Section 2, the following points are treated: char-
acteristics of the adsorbents, speciﬁcation of reagents, 
and description of the experimental procedure with 
formulas used for calculations. In subsequent Section 3, 
experimental characterizations of the activated car-bons, 
namely pH PZC measurement and scanning elec-tron 
microscope (SEM) observations of the porous surface, 
are reported. Results of adsorption experi-ments are 
then showed and discussed. The main results are then 
summarized in Section 4.
2. Experimental
2.1. Activated carbons
Two microporous granular activated carbons pre-
pared by physical activation of milled coconut shells 
were considered, namely GCN1240 and GCN816 G, 
both supplied by Norit Nederland BV. Some relevant 
characteristics of the two carbons are reported in 
Table 1 (GCN1240) and Table 2 (GCN816 G); they are 
identical for raw material, activation method, and sur-
face functional groups, but different in particle size: 
GCN1240 has been sieved to particle size ranging 
between 0.425 and 1.7 mm (equivalent  to mesh size 
range 12–40), while GCN816 G particles range from 
1.18  to 2.36  mm (equivalent to mesh size range 8–16).
The adsorption capacity of an activated carbon is 
mainly determined by its porous structure and surface 
area, but it is also strongly inﬂuenced by the nature of 
functional groups at the carbon surface. Functionalgroups can promote bindings by attracting positive
charge particles such as metal ions [ 48].
Measurements of the pH PZC of the two carbons
were performed, in order to prove the alkaline natureof their surface. The morphologic characteristics of thesurface and the porous structure of the adsorbentswere then observed making use of a SEM.
2.2. Reagents
As the adsorption behavior doesn’t change with
the type of lead isotope considered, stock solutions
with stable isotopes of lead were prepared to investi-gate the removal of lead from aqueous solutions. Stock
solutions of lead (II) were prepared by dissolving ana-
lytical grade lead nitrate Pb(NO
3)2in ultrapure water
(Millipore MilliQ water) at the desired initial concen-trations. Two reasons justify why lead (II) nitrate waschosen as lead-containing solution: (a) nitrate salt is avery water-soluble lead compound, so it guaranteesgreat availability of dissociated lead (II) ions in solu-tion; (b) NO
/C0
3nitrate ion is the conjugate base of the
HNO 3strong acid: it is a very weak base and do not
produce hydrolysis, this means it cannot affect pH, or
lead adsorption during experiments.
2.3. Batch adsorption experiments
Adsorption experiments were carried out by batch
techniques. Activated carbon was kept in contact withTable 1

the activated carbon was separated from the superna-
tant at preset times, aqueous samples were taken andthe residual metal concentrations were analyzed usinga Thermo Fisher X Series II model ICP mass spectrom-eter (each sample was read ﬁve times to get the aver-age value). The amount of adsorbed pollutant wasdetermined by the difference between the initial andthe residual metal concentrations in aqueous solution.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Speciation of lead in aqueous solution
Lead nitrate in aqueous solution dissociates into
Pb2+and NO/C0
3ions. Pb2+ions constitute a Lewis acid
forming coordinate covalent bonds with the surround-
ing water molecules i.e. acid hydrolysis takes place;for metals with multiple charge, such as lead, consecu-tive hydrolysis reactions easily occur, leading to newcomplex species coordinated by one or more Pb
2+
cations.
In particular, literature studies report formation
and stability constants of seven different species of
lead in water solution depending on pH and lead (II)
concentration: in correspondence of low concentra-tions of lead, mononuclear complexes such as PbOH
+,
Pb(OH) 2, and Pb ðOHÞ/C0
3tend to form by hydrolysis;
whereas, at high lead concentrations, a relevant forma-
tion of polinuclear species containing more than onelead ion may be observed, such as Pb 2OH3+,
Pb3ðOHÞ2þ
4,P b 4ðOHÞ4þ
4and Pb 6ðOHÞ4þ
8[39,49 ].
A lead speciation proﬁle, for lead concentrations of
interest for the purpose of this study (100 mg/L at a
temperature of 23˚C) was drawn making use of MINT-
EQA2 simulation software distributed by USEPA, aspeciation model for diluted aqueous systems at equi-librium based on a thermodynamic database. The spe-ciation proﬁles calculated by the software are reportedin Figs. 1and 2. Fig. 1shows the presence of lead in
aqueous phase up to pH near to 6; then, formation ofsolid Pb(OH)
2occurs due to precipitation of lead as
hydroxide, causing the aqueous phase to reduce toextremely low molar concentrations (about 10
6times
lower than the solid phase concentration). Fig. 2
shows the speciation proﬁle of lead only inherent tothe aqueous phase which is 10
6times lower than the
solid phase when pH > 7. It can be seen that the pres-ence of polinuclear complex species is here absolutelynegligible, proving that we are in the case of low lead
concentrations; what is worthy of note is the presence
of some mononuclear species, although low in terms

at higher pH values, it can be observed a formation ofPbOH

In conclusion, the relevant information to the pur-
pose of interest are: (a) aqueous lead as Pb2+ions
exists at pH values lower than the value at which pre-
cipitation of lead hydroxide occurs; (b) solid leadtends to form at higher pH values.
3.2. GCN1240 adsorbent analysis
3.2.1. pH
PZCmeasurement
The pH PZC (point of zero charge) of the GCN1240 
activated carbon surface was measured with the pH drift 
method [50,51]. Known amounts of activated car-bon were 
sequentially added to a given volume (40 mL) of NaCl 
solution 0.1 M; after each addition, the dispersion was 
agitated for 15 min on a magnetic stirrer and its pH value 
was measured by using a dig-ital pH-meter. In 
correspondence with the increasing mass of activated 
carbon, a progressive increase in the pH values of the 
solution was observed, up to the achievement of a plateau, 
deﬁning the pH PZC.A pH PZC = 10.22 was found, 
conﬁrming the alkaline nat-ure of the surface of GCN1240.
The point of zero charge corresponds to the pH of the 
solution at which the carbon presents zero net charge on 
its surface [12]. If the solution pH is under the pH PZC 
value, an excess of dissolved H+ ions will tend to diffuse to 
the boundary layer of the surface, which will tend to 
positively charge; whereas, above the value of pH PZC, an 
increase of negative charge on the surface will take place. 
Hence, it is possible to afﬁrm that pH PZC inﬂuences the 
carbon selectivity toward speciﬁc species: for this reason, 
the pH PZC should be taken into account when considering 
effects of pH on adsorption.
3.2.2.  SEM observations
SEM observation reported in Fig. 3 clearly shows the 
porous structure of the carbon GCN1240 (10,000× 
enlargement). It is possible to notice the pres-ence of 
macropores having size greater than 50 nm; whereas it is 
not possible to see meso and micropores because they 
belong to the internal structure of the adsorbent. Fig. 4 
(30,000× enlargement) and Fig. 5 (100,000× enlargement) 
show the carbon surface with higher magniﬁcation; to be 
noticed the presence of carbon powder which appears 
white-colored because electrostatically charged.It is appropriate to mention a particularly relevant 
property of the GCN1240 taken from the datasheet of the 
carbon: its total speciﬁc surface area measures 1,150 m2/
g (Table 1), which is quite a high value; the total speciﬁc 
surface area is normally determined by ﬁt-ting 
experimental data obtained from adsorption of N2 (at a 
temperature of 77  K) with the  BET equation [52].
3.3. Lead adsorption on GCN1240
3.3.1. Effect of pH on adsorption of lead
The removal efﬁciency of Pb2+ions is strongly
inﬂuenced by the pH of the solution. In order to study
this inﬂuence, adsorption experiments (initial lead

existing at very acid pH values: hence, while surface 
negative charge increases, lead (II) ions become subject 
to a greater  electrostatic attraction, favoring the 
adsorption process [17].
At basic pH values, a removal efﬁciency near to 100% 
occurs due to precipitation of lead (II) hydroxide 
Pb(OH) 2. Now, although hydroxide precipitation per-
mits to obtain an effective lead removal from the 
solution—to the extent that solubility equilibria are 
nowadays the core of separation techniques of huge 
employment—it appears as an undesired effect when 
the purpose is to evaluate what fraction of pollutant is 
actually removed by adsorption.
Moreover, when operating in dynamic conditions via 
column adsorption procedures, the precipitation may 
cause the clogging of the carbon matrix with a 
consequent decrease of the removal efﬁciency of the 
apparatus. Considering what above said, the optimal pH 
value is the higher possible value below the pH of lead 
(II) hydroxide precipitation (the theoretical pH of 
precipitation for a starting lead (II) concentration of 30 
mg/L is 6.0).
Therefore, for this work, it was chosen to perform 
adsorption experiments keeping the natural pH of the 
lead-containing solution, which is above 5.0, and 
remaining below the precipitation pH value.
3.3.2. SEM images and elemental analysis of precipitate
on GCN1240
To produce evidence of the occurring formation of 
Pb(OH) 2 precipitate on the carbon, SEM images were 
taken after an adsorption experiment with initial lead 
concentration of 80 mg/L. The theoretical precipitation 
pH value of lead hydroxide for a lead concentration of 80 
mg/L is 5.78.  After an experiment conducted under 
conditions of pH not controlled (24 h of contact time), it 
was measured a pH 5.92 with a digital pH-meter, which 
is over the precipitation value: so, a formation of solid 
lead is expected to occur on the carbon sur-face. SEM 
images reported in Fig. 7 (1,000× enlarge-ment), Fig. 8 
(5,000× enlargement), Fig. 9 (10,000× enlargement) 
clearly show the presence of solid Pb (OH) 2 hexagonal 
crystals having dimensions in the order of some μm.
To conﬁrm that those crystals are made of lead, an 
elemental analysis was performed. The elemental anal-
ysis, performed on a portion of carbon covered by 
hexagonal crystals, evidenced three peaks correspond-
ing to carbon, oxygen, and lead elements, while on a 
portion of carbon surface not covered by hexagonal 
crystals, only the peak corresponding to the carbon 
element appeared.

concentration of 30 mg/L; carbon mass of 20 mg; con-
tact time of 24 h) were conducted at different pH val-ues, 
by adding an appropriate quantity of HNO 3 or NaOH to 
the samples. Results are shown in Fig. 6, representing 
removal efﬁciency of Pb2+ vs. pH of solu-tion: lead 
removal resulted strongly affected by pH.
At very acid pH values (minor than 4), no removal 
of lead occurs: this behavior can be explained by a 
competition between Pb2+ ions and H+ ions in the 
occupation of the microporous sites on the carbon. At 
increasing pH values (about 5), hydrogen ions disap-
pear from the solution and from the carbon surface 
too, leaving sites free and therefore available for lead 
ions. This experimental evidence suggests that a mech-
anism of ion exchange H(I)/Pb(II) could take place in 
the lead adsorption process. In addition,  at these pH 
values, the negative charge on the surface of the car-
bon tends to increase, because its functional groups 
become subject to deprotonation subsequent to a poor 
concentration of H+ ions in the bulk respect to the one

3.3.3.  Effect of contact time on adsorption of lead
Adsorption experiments were carried out for con-tact 
times ranging from 8 to 96 h with ﬁxed mass of 
adsorbent (30 mg) and initial lead (II) concentration (100 
mg/L), at T = 296.15  K. As shown in Fig. 10, the 
adsorption equilibrium was reached  after 40 h: this value 
has been taken as the equilibrium time.
3.3.4.  Adsorption kinetics of lead
Kinetic models are used to ﬁt experimental data, in 
order to examine the controlling mechanism of the 
adsorption process. To this purpose, experimental data 
were ﬁtted with the following pseudo-ﬁrst-order model
dqt
dt¼K1/C1qe/C0qt ðÞ (3)
where K1is the Lagergren rate constant [h−1];qtand qe
are the adsorption capacities at time tand at equilib-
rium [mg/g], respectively. Integrating and applying
the initial condition qt(0) = 0, Eq. (3) becomes
log10qe/C0qt ðÞ ¼ log10qe/C0K1

Experimental data were also ﬁtted with a pseudo-sec-ond-order model, following the equation
dqt
dt¼K2/C1qe/C0qt ðÞ2(5)
where K2[g/(mg h)] is the rate constant of pseudo-
second-order; by integrating Eq. (5) with the initialcondition q
t(0) = 0, we obtain

Fits of experimental data with the pseudo-ﬁrst-order and 
pseudo-second-order models are reported in Figs. 11 
and 12, respectively. The values of K1, K2, and qe were 
calculated from the slopes and the intercepts of the 
straight lines resulting from the ﬁts: these val-ues are 
listed in Table 3 for both the models, in addi-tion to the 
R2 values. Lead adsorption onto the activated carbon 
seems to better follow a pseudo-second-order kinetic: in fact, the experimental value of 
qe is very near to the calculated one for this model 
and the corresponding R2 value results to be higher.
3.3.5.  Adsorption isotherms of lead
The experimental results concerning the adsorption 
of lead at equilibrium time (40 h at 293.15 K, Fig. 10) 
have been interpreted according to Langmuir and Fre-
undlich adsorption isotherms.
According to the Langmuir model, adsorption 
occurs uniformly on the active sites of the adsorbent; 
once an adsorbate particle occupies a site, no further 
adsorption can take place at that site. The Langmuir 
model is represented by the following equation:
ce
qe¼ce
qmaxþ1
qmax/C1KL(7)
where qmax is the maximum monolayer adsorption 
capacity of the adsorbent and KL is the Langmuir con-
stant related to the free energy of adsorption.
A plot of ce/qe vs. ce results in a straight line with 
a slope of 1/q max and intercept of 1/(q max·KL), as 
shown in Fig. 13.
The equation representing the Freundlich model, 
which is suitable for adsorbents with a highly hetero-
geneous surface, can be written in the linearized form
log10qe¼log10KFþ1
n/C1log10ce (8)
where KF [mg/(g·(mg/L)1/n)] and 1/n are Freundlich 
constants related to the adsorption capacity and the 
adsorption intensity, respectively.
A plot of log 10(qe) vs. log 10(ce) is shown in Fig. 14: 
it results in a straight line with a slope of 1/n and 
intercept of log 10(KF).
Fig. 15 reports a comparison between the adsorp-
tion isotherm models and the experimental data. 
Values of Langmuir and Freundlich constants are

reported in Table 4. Maximum experimental adsorp-tion 
capacity was 92.39  mg/g, conﬁrming that the granular 
activated carbon GCN1240 can be effectively used for 
lead removal from aqueous solutions; in fact, it presents 
very good lead adsorption performances in comparison 
with other adsorbents reported in litera-ture and listed 
in Table 5.
3.3.6.  Effect of initial lead concentration on adsorption
The effect of lead concentration was studied using 
three different lead-containing solutions with concen-
trations between 40 and 150 mg/L, at a ﬁxed mass of 
activated carbon (30 mg). Fig. 16 shows that adsorption 
capacity at equilibrium increases as initial lead 
concentration increases. High lead concentra-tions tend 
to increase the concentration gradient of Pb2+ ions 
toward the boundary layer of the adsorbent surface, 
increasing the diffusive ﬂow and giving the carbon a 
greater adsorption capacity at equilibrium [40].3.3.7.  Effect of carbon mass on adsorption of lead
Effect of the concentration of activated carbon on 
lead removal efﬁciency was observed by executing batch 
adsorption experiments at ﬁxed initial lead con-
centration (100 mg/L) and varying the mass of carbon in 
the dispersion. Removal efﬁciencies found at equi-
librium are plotted in Fig. 17. The results show that the 
removal efﬁciency increases with the concentration of 
activated carbon due to more total surface area available 
(i.e. a greater number of surface functional groups) and 
to a larger available microporous volume (i.e. a greater 
number of active adsorption sites) [22].
3.4. GCN816 G adsorbent analysis
3.4.1. pH PZCmeasurement
The GCN816 G carbon is similar to the GCN1240
in raw material (coconut shell), and activation method
(physical), but is characterized by a bigger particlesize.
A characterization of GCN816 G was carried out
by measuring the pH value corresponding to the point
of zero charge, using the same method used for
GCN1240. The GCN816 G activated carbon shows apH
PZCequal to 9.43, conﬁrming an alkaline surface.
This result allows to afﬁrm that, working in a lead-
containing solution with a pH value lower than 9.43,

3.4.2.  SEM observations
SEM observations of the GCN816 G surface were 
performed. In Fig. 18 (1,000× enlargement), the ana-
lyzed carbon particle shows the presence of two dif-
ferent areas: one in which surface appears very rough, 
and the other one characterized by a smooth surface 
on which macropores conducting toward the internal 
structure of the carbon are well visible. This different 
morphology visible, thanks to the greater particle size 
of this carbon, can be linked to the peculiar “tile” 
shape of carbon granules obtained from coconut 
shells.Fig. 19 (2,000× enlargement) better shows the area 
having smooth surface, when irregular pores are well 
visible; a further enlargement (10,000× enlargement) 
showed in Fig. 20 allows to distinguish the internal 
porous structure, with diameter at the entrance of about 
2 μm.
Fig. 21 eventually shows an enlargement (5,000×) 
of the mentioned area with rough surface.

times ranging from 4 to 144 h, maintaining constant
the mass of adsorbent and initial lead (II) concentrationatT= 296.15 K. To better study the kinetics of theadsorption process on this carbon, two couples of c0-W 
associations were adopted to observe lead adsorption as 
a function of time: in the ﬁrst series of samples, an initial 
lead concentration c0 = 40 mg/L and a mass car-bon W = 
30 mg were adopted, while the second series of samples 
was carried out using c0 = 100 mg/L and W = 50 mg. 
Results plotted in Fig. 22 show that the adsorption 
equilibrium was reached after 96 h, suggesting that 
adsorption of lead on this carbon, with big particles size, 
is a slow process. In the following, 96 h was taken as the 
equilibrium time.
Anyway, the adsorption capacity after 48 h was 
91% of the adsorption capacity at equilibrium concern-
ing the series c0 = 40 mg/L and W = 30 mg, and 87%

were ﬁtted with a pseudo-ﬁrst-order model (Eq. (4)) and 
a pseudo-second-order model (Eq. (6)).
Fits of experimental data with the pseudo-ﬁrst-order 
and pseudo-second-order models are reported in Figs. 
23 and 24 concerning the sample ser-ies c0 = 40 mg/L 
and W = 30 mg, and in Figs. 25 and 26 for the sample 
series c0 = 100 mg/L and W = 50 mg, respectively. The 
values of K1, K2, and qe were calculated from the slopes 
and the intercepts of the straight lines resulting from the 
ﬁts: these values are listed in Table 6 for both the models 
and the series of samples, in addition to the R2 values. 
Lead adsorp-tion onto GCN816 G seems to better follow 
a pseudo-second-order kinetic: this can be said 
considering that the experimental value of qe is very near 
to the calcu-lated one for this model, and the R2 value 
results to be higher for both the series of samples.
3.5.3.  An investigation on the adsorption mechanism
The very slow kinetic of GCN816 G (equilibrium 
time of about 96 h, Fig. 22) allows to perform an 
investigation of the adsorption mechanism based on 
the intraparticle diffusion model. Experimental data 
obtained for the kinetic study are useful to get some 
information on the dynamics of the adsorption pro-
cess. An adsorption reaction can be summarized into 
the following steps:
(1) the ion leaves the bulk toward the boundary
layer of the adsorbent surface;
(2) ﬁlm diffusion: the ion migrates through the
boundary layer toward the external surface of
the adsorbent;
(3) particle diffusion: the ion is transferred from
the surface to the intraparticle active sites; and
(4) the ion is adsorbed on active sites of the
adsorbent.

of the equilibrium adsorption capacity concerning the 
series c0 = 100 mg/L and W = 50 mg, with the advan-
tage to cut in half the duration of the adsorption 
procedure.
Moreover, from Fig. 22, it can be inferred that the 
initial removal process is fast due to the high concen-
tration gradient existing between the bulk and the 
boundary layer of the adsorbent surface and to a 
greater availability of active sites on the carbon sur-
face. For longer times, the removal process velocity 
becomes slower, because lead ions diffuse more 
slowly toward the boundary layer and the total avail-
able microporous surface area tends to diminish [22].
3.5.2.  Adsorption kinetics of lead
Kinetic models are used to ﬁt experimental data, in 
order to examine the controlling mechanism of the 
adsorption process. To this purpose, experimental data

Since the ﬁrst step does not involve the adsorbent and 
the fourth step is a very rapid process, it is possible to 
exclude their relevance on the reaction kinetics. To 
determine what inﬂuence ﬁlm diffusion and particle 
diffusion steps have on the kinetics, the following 
intraparticle diffusion model proposed by Weber and 
Morris is largely employed [22]:qt¼KID/C1t1=2þci (9)
where KID is the kinetic constant of intraparticle diffu-
sion relative to the generic step i of the adsorption 
process [mg/(g h1/2)], and ci is the intercept on the y-axis 
of such step. Values of ci contain information about the 
thickness of the boundary layer because a high  value of 
the intercept may be indicative of an important effect of 
the boundary layer. On the basis of the intraparticle 
diffusion model, a plot was drawn reporting 
experimental values of qt (both for the series c0 = 40 mg/
L, W = 30 mg and for the series c0 = 100 mg/L, W = 50 
mg) vs. t1/2: a linear ﬁt of such plot, shown in Fig. 27, 
allowed to estimate the model parameters KID and ci. The 
obtained multilinear plot suggests the fact that in the 
adsorption process both the two above mentioned steps 
occurred. For both the series of samples, the ﬁrst portion 
of the plot repre-sents adsorption occurring during the 
ﬁlm diffusion step, i = 1, while the second portion 
describes the step, more gradual, of intraparticle 
diffusion, i = 2. Parame-ters of the model were calculated 
and shown in Table 7. For both the initial lead 
concentrations, it resulted KID1 > KID2 and c1 > c2. This 
gives an analyti-cal piece of information concerning the 
fact that in the ﬁrst step (lower times) a faster removal of 
lead was observed: at ﬁrst times, there is more surface 
area available and adsorption reaction is dominated by 
the speed at which lead ions reach the surface. When the 
adsorbate accumulating on the surface obstructs the 
arrival of further ions, the reaction is then domi-nated by 
the speed at which adsorbed ions diffuse from external 
sites to  the internal ones [17].
3.5.4. Effect of pH on adsorption of lead
Inﬂuence of pH on removal efﬁciency of Pb2+ ions 
was investigated for the activated carbon GCN816 G. 
Adsorption experiments at equilibrium (96 h) were 
executed at varying pH values with initial lead con-
centration of 100 mg/L, carbon mass equal to 50 mg; pH 
was adjusted by adding an appropriate quantity of 
HNO 3 or NaOH to the samples. Results are reported in 
Fig. 28, which shows removal efﬁciency of Pb2+ vs. the 
pH of solution: it is apparent that removal of lead is 
affected by the pH of the  solutions.
At pH values below 3, no removal of lead occurs, due 
to competition between H+ and Pb2+ ions. At pH values 
near to 4–5,  lead removal increases thanks to a probable 
mechanism of ion exchange H(I)/Pb(II). At basic pH 
values, a removal efﬁciency near to 100%occurs due to 
precipitation of lead (II) hydroxide Pb (OH) 2 (as already 
seen for GCN1240), due to the fact

that, for a starting lead (II) concentration of 100 mg/L,
the theoretical pH of precipitation for lead hydroxide
is 5.74.This information enables to distinguish betweenremoval due to adsorption and removal due to precip-itation of lead hydroxide, therefore, in this case, theoptimal pH to perform adsorption is between 4 and 6.
For this reason, in the following, adsorption
experiments with initial and ﬁnal pH values belowthe theoretical pH of precipitation of lead hydroxide
were considered signiﬁcant for investigations on the
adsorption process. The pH values were measured atthe end of each adsorption experiment due to thealkaline nature of the activated carbon that tends tochange the pH of the dispersion toward alkalinevalues.
As a general rule to allow adsorption and to avoid
precipitation, the mass of activated carbon used
should be carefully evaluated to avoid precipitation.3.5.5. SEM images and elemental analysis of precipitate
on GCN816 G
SEM images were taken of a carbon sample after an 
equilibrium adsorption experiment (initial concen-
tration of 100 mg/L, carbon mass of 50 mg) in which pH 
had been adjusted to 7.0 by adding NaOH and the 
removal observed was of 25 mg/g. Since the experi-
ment was conducted at pH values above the precipita-
tion value of the lead hydroxide, SEM analysis 
evidenced a carbon surface completely obstructed by 
lead crystals, as visible in Fig. 29 (1,000× enlargement) 
and Fig. 30 (5,000× enlargement). Conﬁrming that 
crystals are Pb(OH) 2 precipitate, the elemental superﬁ-
cial analysis showed presence of lead, oxygen, and 
carbon elements on the activated carbon surface.
For comparison, a carbon particle was observed 
with SEM after an adsorption experiment (initial con-
centration of 100 mg/L, carbon mass of 50 mg,Table 6

removal 30 mg/g) in which the ﬁnal pH resulted to be 
below the pH value of precipitation for the hydroxide 
(pH 5.54  was measured by digital pH-meter, against a 
pH of precipitation theoretically equal to 5.74). Fig. 31 
(1,000× enlargement) and Fig. 32 (5,000× enlargement) 
show that the carbon particle surface appears covered by 
few solid lead crystals, indicating some presence of 
precipitate. Precipitation may be explained with the 
occurrence of phenomena of microprecipitation due to 
local variation of the pH near the carbon surface. Any-
way, the phenomenon appears much less marked with 
respect to the case of the sample examined in Figs. 29 
and 30. In fact, observing Fig. 32 (made with the same 
enlargement as Fig. 30), access to the internal porosities 
result clearly visible: if porosities remainaccessible to the adsorbate, it is allowed to suppose
that the removed lead was effectively adsorbed insidethe carbon. This was conﬁrmed by elemental superﬁ-cial analysis, which showed the lead and oxygen
peaks to be very low with respect to the carbon peak.
The above comparison analysis conﬁrm that precipita-tion should be avoided because, even if removal takes
place, it obstructs the access to internal porosity thus,
limiting the availability of internal adsorption sites forfurther removal.

according to Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption 
isotherms.
According to the Langmuir model (Eq. (7)), a plot 
of ce/qe vs. ce resulting in a straight line with a slope 
of 1/q max and intercept of 1/(q max·KL), is reported in 
Fig. 33.
Following the Freundlich model (Eq. (8)), a plot of 
log 10(qe) vs. log 10(ce) was obtained and reported in 
Fig. 34: it results in a straight line with a slope of 1/n 
and intercept of log 10(KF).
Fig. 35 allows a comparison among the adsorption 
isotherm models and the adsorption experimental 
data. Values of Langmuir and Freundlich constants 
are shown in Table 8. Experimental data are better 
interpreted by the Langmuir model (R2 = 0.99) com-
pared to the Freundlich model (R2 = 0.75). As for the 
GCN816 G activated carbon, the maximum adsorption 
capacity experimentally found is 32.08 mg/g, which is 
a value not particularly high but still comparable with 
other granular activated carbons reported in literature 
(Table 5).
3.5.7.  Effect of initial lead concentration on adsorption
The effect of lead concentration was studied using 
three lead-containing solutions at initial concentrations 
ranging from 40 to 200 mg/L, at a ﬁxed mass of acti-
vated carbon (50 mg). Fig. 36 shows that the removal 
efﬁciency of lead decreases as the initial lead concen-
tration increases. This may be due to the fact that, at 
lower concentrations, the ratio between metal ions and 
the number of available sites for adsorption is low; as a 
consequence, the fraction of adsorbed ions becomes 
independent from the initial concentration. At higher 
concentrations, available adsorption sites become more 
rare with respect to the number of ions in solution and 
so, the efﬁciency of metal removal depends on initial 
concentrations [40]. Because of this behavior, 
considering equal mass of carbon, GCN816 G is more 
efﬁcient to remove relatively low concentrations of lead, 
while GCN 1240  is more suitable for highly 
contaminated solutions.
3.5.8. Effect of carbon mass concentration on adsorption
of lead
Removal efﬁciency vs. carbon mass concentration 
was obtained by performing equilibrium adsorption 
experiments at ﬁxed initial lead concentration (100 mg/
L) and varying the activated carbon mass in the 
dispersion (30 mL). Results are plotted in Fig. 37.

Results show that removal efﬁciency increases if
the concentration of activated carbon increases,
according to results obtained for GCN1240. A plot ofadsorption capacity vs. carbon mass is also reportedin Fig. 38: adsorption capacity decreases while carbon 
concentration increases, suggesting that, at lower car-
bon concentration, all the active sites are available for 
metal ions. In particular, the maximum adsorption 
capacity is reached with 30 mg of carbon into 30 mL 
of aqueous solution containing 100 mg/L of lead (II). 
While increasing the activated carbon mass, only a 
part of the active sites results exposed and occupied 
by Pb2+ ions, justifying a lower adsorption capacity in 
correspondence of high carbon concentrations [22].
4. Conclusions
The present study was aimed to investigate the
feasibility of using, for separation of lead (II) fromaqueous solutions, two commercially available granu-lar activated carbons prepared by physical activationof coconut shells selected to purify potable water from
dissolved organics (GCN1240) and for use in gold
recovery systems (GCN 816 G). The two carbons pre-
sented different particle size; a characterization of both
the adsorbents was provided through pH
PZCmeasure-
ments and SEM observations. Adsorption tests wereconducted in batch laboratory mode. Experimentalresults discussed in this work lead to the followingconclusions:
/C15both the activated carbons could be successfullyused for adsorption of lead (II) ions from aque-ous solutions; the maximum adsorption capacityof the studied activated carbons resulted to be
92.39 mg/g (GCN1240) and 32.08 mg/g (GCN
816 G);
/C15optimal pH value for adsorption in batch labora-
tory mode was found around 5.0;
/C15SEM observations showed formations of lead
hydroxide crystals on the carbons’ surfaceobstructing the pores at pH values above the pHat which Pb(OH)
2precipitates;
/C15precipitation should be avoided, because itobstructs the access to internal adsorption sites;to avoid precipitation, due to its alkaline nature,
the mass of used carbon should be carefully
chosen;
/C15experimental parameters such as contact time
and initial metal concentration must be opti-
mally selected to obtain the highest possible leadremoval from the aqueous solution; and
/C15the very slow kinetics observed with the carbonwith bigger particles size allowed to perform a
deep investigation about the steps constituting
the adsorption mechanism based on the intrapar-ticle diffusion model.
