abstract
Dyes considered as a main environmental pollutant are present in various effluents released from 
different industries like textiles. Dyes cause problems such as reduced light penetration, allergies, 
and cancer when they are entered into the environment. The purpose of this study was to compare 
the efficiency of the activated carbon coated with the zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles prepared by walnut shell in removing two dyes from aqueous environments. The study used a floating method 
to prepare the AC-ZnO composite. The composite structure and morphology were studied using 
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), X-ray diffraction and 
field emission scanning electron microscopy techniques. The results confirmed the accuracy of the 
composite structure. Moreover, the study examined reaction time, solution pH, composite volume, and initial dye concentration and AC-ZnO composite recovery. The removal efficiencies under the 
optimal conditions for Reactive Blue 19 (RB-19) and Reactive Black-5 (RB-5) (dye concentrations 
100 mg L
–1, composite dose 1.5 g L–1, reaction time 45 min and pH 3) were 97.36% and 73.36%, 
respectively. The results of the experimental data were fitted well to the Langmuir isotherm, indicat-ing monolayer adsorption of both metal ions onto the AC-ZnO composite and an estimated adsorp-tive capacity of 71.42 (RB-5) and 94.33 mg g
–1 (RB-19). However, the kinetic data agreed well with 
the pseudo-second-order model. The SBET and total pure volume for the AC-ZnO composite and AC 
were 728.17 m2 g–1, 687.95 m2 g–1 and 0.684 cm3 g–1, 0.612 cm3 g–1, respectively. It can be concluded 
that AC-ZnO composite as an effective and environmentally friendly adsorbent had a high ability in removing dye from aqueous solutions.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, dyes have made major concerns about 
environmental pollution, particularly in effluents released from industries [1,2] such as textiles, food, paper, cosmet-
ics, medicine, and leather [3,4]. In textile industries, about 10%–15% of the dyes make serious environmental problems after dyeing processes [5,6]. Most of the dyes in the waste-water are stable and non-biodegradable [7]. By limiting 355 Y. Rashtbari et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 179 (2020) 354–367
the penetration of sunlight, dyes affect the photosynthetic 
capacity of aquatic plants [8,9]. Some dyes have toxic, car -
cinogenic and mutagenic impacts and affect human being’s 
and animal’s health [10]. The risks of dyes on the environ-
ment have made researchers focus on dye removal. In the last few decades, several methods such as filtration [11], 
biological purification [12,13], coagulation, and floccula-
tion [14] and chemical oxidation have been developed [15] 
but each one has its disadvantages. Membranes applied for 
reverse osmosis processes are extremely expensive and con-taminated membranes require special treatments for their 
recovery [16]. Coagulation and flocculation have limitations 
for the removal of dyes from wastewater due to their low 
capacity and production of large quantities of dangerous 
sludge [17]. Among the mentioned methods, the adsorption process is one of the most effective processes for dye removal 
at large scales [18–23].
There are several methods for the synthesis of nano-
particles. Many techniques are inefficient in terms of energy 
and material consumption. In most chemical methods, a chemical reducing agent is used as a stabilizer (polyvin-
ylpyrrolidone) to control particle growth and prevent accu-
mulation. Thus, the synthesis of environmentally friendly 
nanoparticles is increasing nowadays. An alternative method is to synthesize nanoparticles using biological methods. In this method, various plant extracts and their products can 
be used as an alternative to the synthesis of nanoparticles. 
Recently, plant extracts, such as green and black tea extracts, 
grape leaf and eucalyptus leaves, have been utilized to synthesize nZVI and other nanoparticles [24,25].
Among nanoparticles, zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO 
NPs) are one of the multifunctional inorganic nanoparticles 
considered as an ideal agent having many signiﬁcant fea-
tures [26]. In addition, human beings exposed to chemically synthesized ZnO NPs with smaller doses have not had toxic effects in vivo, whereas high concentrations can cause sud-
den death [27]. Furthermore, wide applications of ZnO NPs 
increase the potential toxic risk for its release to the environ-
ment [28]. Based on the biological method, the synthesis of the ZnO NPs benefits from simplicity, eco-friendliness and extended antimicrobial activity [29]. However, the nanopar -
ticles produced by plants are more stable and the increased 
synthesis rate of nanoparticles attains a great interest due 
to crude extracts of plants containing a naturally occurring, reducing and stabilizing agent, making this an advantageous approach [30].
In the application of nanomaterials in filtration technol-
ogy, the separation of dispersed nanoparticles from aque-
ous solutions at the end of the process is difficult. Thus, to 
accelerate the separation of them, the stabilization of the nanoparticles with materials such as oxides, polymers, fibers, 
activated carbon, and others are needed. Additionally, given 
the lack of need for the separation of an adsorbent after the 
process, the use of stabilized nanoparticles at a large scale is 
more economical and feasible [24,31].
Activated carbon has attracted great attention due to 
its high availability, low cost, high surface area, reusability, surface chemical properties and high pore volume [32,33]. 
However, commercial activated carbon is very costly. Thus, 
the scholars look for low-cost materials to replace the com-mercial activated carbon.Activated carbon can be prepared from materials such as 
algae, coconut shells, corn, lignin, and so on [34]. The worn tires are extensively available in most areas. The production 
of activated carbon from these materials not only reduces 
the risks of their disposal but also produces a valuable product [35].
To our best knowledge, no reports have been presented 
regarding the performance of activated carbon produced 
from worn tires and the effect of stabilizing nanoparticles 
using plant extracts on activated carbon to remove Reactive Blue 19 (RB-19) and Reactive Black-5 (RB-5) dyes. Hence, its 
effectiveness in the removal of RB-19 and RB-5 was studied 
by different variables such as pH, reaction time, adsorbent 
dose, and initial dye concentration in synthetic solutions. 
Finally, the kinetics of the reactions and the adsorption isotherms were determined for the dye removal.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Reagents, materials, and solutions
RB-19 and RB-5 dyes used in this study were prepared 
from Alvan Sabet Co., Hamedan, Iran. The general charac-
teristics of both dyes have been presented in Table 1 [36,37]. In addition, H
2SO4 and NaOH obtained from Merck Co., 
Germany, were applied to adjust the pH of the dye solu-tion. It should be noted that in all stages of the experiments, double distilled water was used.
2.2. Instruments
The residual concentration of RB-19 and RB-5 dyes was 
measured by a UV/Vis spectrophotometer (HACH DR5000, 
USA) at the wavelengths 592 and 599 nm, respectively [36,38].
The characteristics of the samples including surface area, 
pore-volume, and pore size were determined by N
2 adsorp-
tion at 77 K using a Micromeritics (Australia) Tristar 3000 analyzer. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was performed to determine the functional groups at the adsorbent layers of the activated carbon by the PerkinElmer Spectrum FTIR spectrometer by KBr pallet technique in the range 450–4,000 cm
–1 (FTIR, PerkinElmer, USA). X-ray dif-
fraction (XRD) was employed to assess the phase structure of the samples by a Philips PAN-analytical diffractometer equipped with a Cu Ka X-ray source. Also, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was used for deter -
mining the surface and morphological characteristics of the adsorbent at 10 keV acceleration voltage.
2.3. Activated carbon preparation
At first, the worn tires were crushed to a size fraction 
of 0.2–2.5 cm and then immersed in concentrated phos-
phoric acid for 48 h to be activated at ambient tempera-
ture. Afterward, rubbers were placed in a cylindrical steel reactor. The reactor than was placed in a programmable fur -
nace model, HL40P controller. Furnace temperature reached 
500°C at a rate of 5°C min
–1 and then we remained at this 
temperature for 2 min. Next, the produced activated carbon was placed in an ultrasonic device at 37 kHz. The obtained Y. Rashtbari et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 179 (2020) 354–367 356
activated carbon was washed several times using deionized 
water to reach a pH of about 7. The washed specimens were completely dried for 2 h in an oven at 110°C. Finally, the acti-vated carbon was stored in a container away from moisture for later use [24].
2.4. Preparation of ZnO nanoparticles by green synthesis method
In this study, the walnut shell was used to synthesize the 
ZnO nanoparticles in a greenway. To this end, 30 g of walnut 
shell was added to 500 mL of distilled water and placed on 
a magnetic stirrer at 300 rpm for 60 min at 80°C. After 1 h of extraction, the mixture was removed from the magnetic heater, cooled and then ﬁltered through a vacuum pump. The 
obtained extract was mixed with ZnCl
2 (1 M) with a ratio of 
2 to 3 and the synthesis of nanoparticles was seen by the for -
mation of white clusters. Afterward, the mixture was poured 
into a graduated cylinder, washed 3 times with ethanol and then rinsed with double distilled water. In the next step, the residue was placed into a 50°C an oven to be completely dried. Then, to remove the interference from organic matters in the experiments, the nanoparticles were heated at room temperature for 2 h at 400°C in an electric furnace. Finally, the nanoparticles were stored for later use [24,39].
2.5. Loading ZnO nanoparticles on activated carbon
After AC preparation and ZnO synthesis, to produce the 
composite, first, 0.05 g of ZnO nanoparticles was added to 
200 cc distilled water and was placed on a magnetic stirrer for 
10 min to obtain a uniform solution. Next, 5 g of the activated carbon was added into the solution and placed again on a magnetic stirrer at 500 rpm for 10 h to complete the coating process. Then, the obtained composite was removed with a filter paper and washed several times with double-distilled water. Finally, the prepared composite was completely dried for 10 h in an oven at 95°C [24,40].
2.6. Adsorption experiments
The adsorption experiments were done by colored solu-
tions with pH changes (3, 5, 7, 9 and 11), adsorbent value (0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 g L
–1), dye concentration (50, 100, 
and 150 mg L–1) and contact time (5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 
75 min). During the process, the solution was stirred by 
a magnetic stirrer at 250 rpm. After the completion of the reaction time, centrifugation was done to isolate the solvent absorber at 3,000 rpm for 5 min. Then, the residual concentra-
tion of RB-19 and RB-5 were determined by the colorimetric method. Finally, the removal efficiency and dye absorbance in the adsorbent mass unit for RB-19 and RB-5 after the adsorption process was determined through Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively [41,42].

where C0 and Ct are the initial and final concentrations of the 
dyes in solution (mg L–1), V is the volume of the solution (L), 
and M is the mass of the adsorbent [43].
2.7. Determination of point-of-zero-charge (pzc)
One of the most important characteristics of the adsor -
bent is pHzpc, showing the state of electrical charge disper -
sion on the adsorbent surface. To determine pHzpc, 30 mL of 
a 0.1 M solution of sodium salt was poured into 100 mL 11 
Erlenmeyer flasks and the pH of the solutions was adjusted between 2 and 12. Then, 0.05 g of the composite prepared in each of the flasks was added. Next, the solutions were placed on a shaker at a speed of 250 rpm for 48 h. Later, the final pH of the solutions was measured after the adsorption separation. Finally, pH
pzc was determined after plotting the 
final pH change curve against the initial pH [44].
2.8. Determination of the efficiency of the adsorption process in 
removing dye from the actual wastewater
At this stage, the real wastewater was taken from a tex-
tile company and the composite performance was analyzed Table 1

for removing the dyes under the optimal conditions obtained 
from the artificial wastewater. To measure the dye, the adsorption curve was initially plotted using a spectropho-tometer for the real centrifugal and filtered wastewater (to remove turbidity). The measurement was done at the maximum absorbance wavelength of 274 nm.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of the adsorbent
3.1.1. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis
Fig. 1a shows the nitrogen adsorption/desorption iso-
therms of the AC-ZnO composite and AC. According to the 
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry classifi-
cation, the isotherms can be regarded as type IV indicating 
that the AC-ZnO composite and AC are porous and meso-
porous. The hysteresis loop shows a capillary condensation step ( p/p
0) between 0.5 and 0.9, illustrating the presence of 
mesoporous structure in both absorbents [45]. According 
to Fig. 1, it can be found that the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller 
(SBET) of the AC-ZnO composite is more than that of the AC. 
The SBET and pore volume of the adsorbents have been com-
piled in Table 2. The results obtained showed that the SBET 
and total pure volume for the AC-ZnO composite and AC are 156.78 m
2 g–1, 134.44 m2 g–1, 0.478 cm3 g–1, 0.421 cm3 g–1, respec-
tively. The AC-ZnO composite and AC showed an average pore diameter of 2–3 nm, which can play an important role in the adsorption properties. On the one hand, the mesoporosity feature of materials allows that ions penetrate easier into their porous.3.1.2. FTIR analysis
FTIR analysis provides structural information and com -
binations of sample functional groups. Fig. 2 shows the 
FTIR analysis of the activated carbon and AC-ZnO com-posite. The adsorption peak at 900–1,300 cm
–1 is related to 
phosphorus-containing functional groups, where the activa-tion of phosphoric acid during the preparation process was used [46]. Moreover, the peaks created at wavelengths of 400–800 cm
–1 are related to the vibrations of Zn–O bonds in 
ZnO. The presence of the ZnO nanoparticles can be proved by the appearance of an adsorption band in 506 cm
–1 [47]. 
The 2,800–3,000 cm–1 band with a peak at 2,859 cm–1 in the 
AC-ZnO composite is related to the presence of C–H alkanes [24]. The observed peak for the AC and AC-ZnO in the band 3,432 cm
–1 can be related to the vibration of O–H in the H2O 
molecule [48]. In addition, the observed peaks at 2,925 and 2,850 cm
–1 bands showed the involvement of C–H and O–H 
(acidic group) of walnut shell extract in particle formation [49]. Polyphenols, acting as the main stabilizing factor for NPs, are observed from 3,200 to 3,500 cm
–1 [47]. Some peaks 
in AC disappeared after ZnO coating and the disorder in the AC-ZnO spectrum decreased. Overall, the ZnO coating on AC was successful.
3.1.3. XRD analysis
The XRD pattern for the adsorbent at angle 2θ has been 
shown to determine the crystalline phase and structural 
properties of the nanoparticles. The results of this analysis showed that the peaks produced in 31.75°, 34.45°, 36.32°, 47.52°, 59.6°, 62.85°, 66.45°, 67.95°, and 69.15° degrees were

the indicators of ZnO in the structure of the synthesized 
adsorbent (Fig. 3). Moreover, the formation of sharpened and pulled peaks at angles 23.61°, 24.1°, and 26.5° was related to carbon, hence it could be stated that ZnO was successfully synthesized [50,51].
3.1.4. FESEM analysis
The surface and morphological characteristics of the 
activated carbon and AC-ZnO composite have been shown 
in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 shows the presence of pores and cavities on 
activated carbon with an asymmetric distribution. In addi-
tion, Fig. 4 indicates the nanoparticles of the ZnO particles 
as white particles. These nanoparticles were dispersed uni-formly at an activated carbon level. The stabilization of the ZnO nanoparticles on the AC partially blocked the activated 
carbon porosity, which is probably because ZnO nano-
particles could not enter the internal voids of the activated 
carbon tissue; as a result, they remained on the outer surface of the activated carbon. The FESEM image of the stabilized nanoparticles showed that the composite had porosity with a suitable surface and ZnO nanoparticles were well stabilized on the AC [18,50].
3.2. Effect of pH
The pH of aqueous solutions is one of the important 
parameters in controlling adsorption processes and the 
adsorption load level and ionic charge of dye molecules play a significant role in these processes [52]. Fig. 5 shows the effect of pH on the dye adsorption process. As can be observed with increasing pH from 3 to 11 the removal effi-ciency of the dyes decreased, which were from 71.58% to 47.24% for RB-19 and from 67.65% to 44.64% for RB-5. At this stage, pH = 3 was selected as the optimum value. At low pHs, the positive charge density increased on the 4000 3500 3000 2500 2000 1500 1000 500507

adsorbent surface and increased significantly between the 
adsorbent positive charge load and the electrochemical grav-ity molecule. Hence, the dye access to active sites increased and the dye distribution was facilitated. Furthermore, in alka-line pH, the number of sites with negative load increased, thereby decreasing the number of positive charge sites, which caused an increase in electrostatic repulsion [53,54].
Khaled et al. used an activated carbon of orange peel as an 
adsorbent to remove Direct N Blue-106 dye. The results illus-trated that the removal efficiency of the dye increases with decreasing pH. The results were consistent with the present study [52]. Jamshidi et al. [55] obtained the same results in their study in which the removal of RB-19 dye by olive oil ash was evaluated. The observations were also in line with those of Fazlzadeh et al. [56].
3.3. Effect of adsorbent dose
Determination of absorbent dose is one of the most 
important parameters in adsorption given the economic 
considerations. Fig. 6 shows a change in the process of dye adsorption by the composite. The results illustrated that the 
removal rate in both dyes increased with raising adsorbent 
dose; it should be noted that the highest removal rate was 
observed at the dose of 2 g L
–1. When the dose was raised 
from 0.25 to 1.5 g L–1, the removal efficiency rates of RB-19 
and RB-5 increased from 31.41% to 96.19% and 28.66% to 71.37%, respectively. However, with an increasing dose of up to 2 g L
–1, the removal rate was negligible. Furthermore, 
the adsorption capacity reduced with an increase in dose, 
causing that the adsorption capacity of RB-19 and RB-5 to 
decline from 125.64 to 49.51 mg g–1 and 114.64 to 37.26 mg g–1 
in doses from 0.25 to 2 g L–1. Therefore, 1.5 g L–1 of the adsor -
bent was selected as the optimum dose. The number of pos-itive sites enhances at the higher doses of the absorbent, increasing absorbency and strong propulsion [57]. At low doses of the absorbent, fewer active sites were available to the dye molecules, ending in a reduction in removal [58]. Although with an increase in adsorbent dose the removal efficiency increased due to the saturation of some sites on the adsorbent surface, leading to a decrease in adsorption capacity [59]. The results of the research by Afkhami and Moosavi [60] showed that with an increase in adsorbent 
dose, the removal efficiency of the dye from the aqueous 
solution increased, which was in line with the findings of 
this study. Machado et al. [61] used multi-walled carbon 
nanotubes in the context of the adsorption of reactive red-dyed M-2BE in 2011; they reported similar results, and the 
results of the study were in line with those of the study by 
Nadejde et al. [62].
3.4. Eﬀect of contact time
Another factor affecting dye removal is contact time. 
To examine the optimum contact time for the experiments, 
ranges of 50 to 150 mg L
–1 and reaction time from 2 to 75 min 
were tested. As shown in Fig. 7, the composite efficiency 23456789 10 11 12354045505560657075Removal Percentage (% )

decreased in the removal of both dyes from a concentration 
of 50–150 mg L–1. According to the results, the optimal con-
tact time for the composite was 30 min. The adsorption of dye molecules on the outer surfaces of the composite started. However, due to the relative repulsion electrostatic force of the negative surface loads absorbed on the composite sur -
face and the negative loads contained in the fluid mass, the emission rate of the contaminants within the porosity and, consequently, the adsorption rate decreased [63]. Moreover, firstly, the available levels for absorbing the pollutant on the composite were completely free; the contaminant was there-fore in contact with the entire composite surface. As time passed, the available levels were reduced and the adsorption rate decreased as well [52]. These results were fully consis -
tent with those of Regti et al. [64], who examined the removal of a dye using activated carbon. Furthermore, the results were similar to the observations in a study by Afshin et al. [42] who investigated the removal of a dye with an activated carbon prepared from filamentous algae.
3.5. Effect of dye concentration
As can be seen from Fig. 8, an increase in the initial con-
centration of RB-19 and RB-5 from 25 to 300 mg L
–1 caused 
the adsorption efficiency to decrease from 100% to 47.35% 
and from 100% to 37.67%, respectively. With an increase of the initial dye concentration, due to the lack of active sites and the saturation of adsorption sites, the efficiency of removal was reduced because the adsorbent dose was con-stant [65]. Additionally, by increasing the initial dye con-tent, the repulsion force created between the dye molecules disrupted the adsorption process and reduced the removal efficiency [43,66]. The results were completely consistent with the studies by Gupta et al. [53], who investigated the removal of dye blue 113 by an activated carbon from worn treads. Furthermore, Roosta et al. [67] obtained similar results in a study to remove dye with ZnS:Ni nanoparticles.
3.6. Adsorption isotherms
The changes in the initial concentrations of both iso-
therms were measured to examine the mechanism of the equilibrium between the pollutant and composite. 
The adsorption data were analyzed using the Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherm equations [68,69].
The linear equations for the isotherms and kinetics have 
been given in Table 3 [31,70–72]. As the results in Fig. 9 and Table 4 show, the adsorption of RB-19 and RB-5 dyes using the present composite follows a regression coefficient of 
0.9985 and 0.9656, respectively, of the Langmuir isotherm 
model. The Langmuir isotherm can be expressed in terms 
of a dimensionless constant named equilibrium parameter R
L, which is defined as follows:
RkCL
L=+×1
10 (3)

irreversible (RL = 0) [73,74]. The calculated values of RL under 
different C0 are found to be far lower than 1, showing the 
favorable adsorption of RB-5 and RB-19 by AC-ZnO.
Moreover, in this model, the value of 1/n  was less than 
1, showing that the adsorption of dyed material on the 
composite in lower concentrations was better than high concentrations of the dye and the process of adsorption was a chemical process [52,69]. The results accorded with the reports provided by other studies [50,55,75]. Table 5 shows the adsorption capacity of different types of adsor -
bent for RB-19 and RB-5. The maximum adsorption capacity of AC-ZnO for RB-19 and RB-5 was 94.33 and 71.42 mg g
–1, 
respectively. The results of the maximum adsorption capacity obtained indicated that the AC-ZnO composite had better performance than the other adsorbents used.3.7. Adsorption kinetics
The rate of adsorption processes is critical in designing 
and evaluating adsorbents in the removal of dyes from dye solutions [76]. Fig. 10 presents the results of RB-19 and RB-5 dyes adsorption kinetics. The pseudo-first-order and second-  
order kinetic equations have been shown linearly (Table 3).  
In this equation, q
e and qt were, respectively, adsorption 
capacities in equilibrium and time, as well as k1 and k2, the 
pseudo-first-rate and pseudo-second-order velocity coef-ficients. Considering the fixed coefficients and the correla-tion obtained in Table 6, it can be claimed that the process in question follows the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, and most of the adsorption was done by chemical absorp-tion, confirming the results of the process isotherm [80]. Moreover, the results presented in Table 6 show that with 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.400.0100.0150.0200.0250.0300.035(a)  RB 19

increasing the concentration of RB-19 and RB-5 from 50 to 
150 mg L–1, the constant rate of reaction decreases from 0.032 
to 0.003 and from 0.018 to 0.0029. This phenomenon shows that with increasing the concentration of pollutants, the adsorption rate decreased. The results of the isotherm of the process (0.1n  < 1) illustrated that at the low concentrations of 
the pollutant, the process had a high efficiency. The results of Özcan et al. [36] regarding absorbing RB-19 dye using modified bentonite from aqueous solutions showed that the kinetics of this dye adsorption was consistent with the pseudo-second-order model. Ghaedi et al. [50] found similar results in their study on the removal of malachite green dye using a magnetic-activated carbon-oxide-zinc composite.
The intraparticle diffusion model proposed by Weber 
and Morris [81] was used to describe how the diffusion of RB-19 and RB-5 dye molecules onto AC-ZnO composite takes place. The diffusion model equations were shown lin-early (Table 3), where k
id is the intra-particle diffusion rate 
constant. A plot of qt vs. t1/2 should be a straight line with a 
slope kid and intercept C when the adsorption mechanism 
follows the intraparticle diffusion process. The values of the intercept give an idea about the thickness of the boundary layer, that is, the larger the intercept the greater is the bound-ary layer eﬀect [82]. The values of characteristic parameters in the intraparticle diffusion model, k
id, and Ci were deter -
mined through plotting qt vs. t1/2 (Fig. 11) (Table 7). From 
Fig. 11, it can be inferred that the lines did not pass through the origin, indicating that the intraparticle diffusion was not the only rate-limiting mechanism in the adsorption process; thus, some other mechanisms like liquid film diffusion may influence the adsorption kinetics.
3.8. Regeneration studies
The regeneration and recycling abilities of the adsor -
bents are important economically and the chemical method 
is mostly used in the retrieval of the adsorbents [83]. The disposing of spent adsorbents can be difficult because some of them could be hazardous and need to be incinerated and 
may be toxic, flammable or even explosive. The adsorption 
ability of the AC-ZnO composite for RB-19 and RB-5 dyes 
from aqueous solution was examined by using 0.1 M HNO3 and NaOH as a model. In the first stage, 1 g of the AC-ZnO composite was added in 100 mg L
–1 of RB-19 and RB-5 dyes 
solution under the optimum conditions and, after the equi-librium time, the regeneration of the absorbent was investi-gated. These adsorption regeneration cycles were carried out up to five times (Fig. 12). After the regeneration, the spent adsorbents for the next regeneration stage were dried at 100°C for 12 h. Generally, it can be seen that the adsorption capacity of the composite decreased as the number of regen-eration cycles increased. The AC-ZnO regeneration by 0.1M NaOH and 0.1 M HNO
3 was able to maintain an elimination 
efficiency of about 66.34% and 54.81% for RB-19 and equaled 47.84% and 43.69% for RB-5, respectively, even after the fifth cycle (Fig. 12). The high concentrations of NaOH and HNO
3 
ions compete with RB-19 and RB-5 in active sites, and RB-19 and RB-5 were recovered from active sites and absorbent sites [83]. Given the proper recovery of AC-ZnO, its efficiency cost would be cost-effective. Moreover, it reduced secondary pollution in wastewater treatment [84].
3.9. Real wastewater samples
The results of dye removal from the actual samples have 
been shown in Fig. 13. Dye removal by the AC-ZnO com-
posite was 76.22%. The properties of the actual wastewater were different from those of the synthetic samples. Some Table 4

compounds like organic matter, in actual wastewater that 
may be removed by the adsorption process, thereby reduc-ing the efficiency of the system in removing dye. Thus, it is expected to see a difference in the efficiency of the removal in actual and artificial samples. However, overall, these results showed the proper performance of the composite in remov-ing dye from the actual samples.
4. Conclusions
The study indicated the significant efficiency of the 
AC-ZnO composite in the adsorption of RB-19 and RB-5 
from aqueous solutions. XRD, BET, FESEM, and FTIR tech-
niques confirmed the nature and structure of the compos-
ite. The results illustrated that an increase in reaction time 
and composite dosage increased the process efficiency. In 
contrast, an increase in pH and initial concentration of the 
dyes reduced the adsorption efficiency significantly. Under 
the optimal conditions: pH 3, initial dye concentration 
100 mg L
–1, composite dose 1.5 g L–1 and reaction time 45 min, 
the removal efficiency rates for RB-19 and RB-5 were 97.36% 
and 73.36%, respectively. The results of the isotherm study and adsorption kinetics for both RB-19 and RB-5 showed that the adsorption process followed the Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetics. Furthermore, the results of the AC-ZnO composite regeneration with 0.1 M NaOH showed that high removal efficiency maintained after five times of reuse. Finally, it can be concluded that the studied composite can be used as an adsorbent with high access, efficient, and high-performance to remove dyes from the wastewater of different industries to evaluate the operating conditions of the adsorption process accurately.
