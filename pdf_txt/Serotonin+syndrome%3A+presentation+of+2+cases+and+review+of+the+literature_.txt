Confidential and Proprietary Information 2What is Serotonin Syndrome (serotonin toxicity)?
•A potentially life -threatening condition associated with increased 
serotonergic activity in the central nervous system as a result of 
serotonergic medication use
•The degree of serotonin buildup affects the severity of symptoms that can occur, including altered mental status, autonomic hyperactivity, and neuromuscular changes
•Untreated disease can rapidly worsen over 24 hours, emphasizing the importance of accurate prevention, diagnosis, and treatmentEpidemiology

Clinical Practice. International Journal of Molecular Sciences . 2019; 20(9):2288. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20092288How It Works
•CNS : attention, behavior, 
thermoregulation
•PNS : motility, vasoconstriction, uterine 
contraction, bronchoconstriction
•No single receptor is solely responsible
•Can occur after initiating one 
serotonergic drug or increasing doses of 
a serotonergic drug in sensitive 
individuals
•More severe episodes with MAOI (death)

•Must include a serotonergic agent + at least 
(1) of the following conditions:
•Spontaneous clonus
•Inducible clonus plus agitation 
ordiaphoresis
•Ocular clonus plus agitation 
ordiaphoresis
•Tremor plus hyperreflexia
•Hypertonia plus temperature 
>100.4° F(38°C)plus ocular clonus or

Serotonergic Agents
•Overdose with a serotonergic agent, except a direct serotonin receptor 
agonist
›Direct serotonin receptor agonists are less likely to cause excessive stimulation 
of 5- HT1A and 5- HT2 serotonin receptors on their own
•Drug -drug interaction of two serotonergic agents, except when both are 
direct serotonin receptor agonists
•Initiation or increase in dose of a serotonergic agent or agent that 
decreases metabolism of serotonergic agent

PREVENTIONPrevention
Strategy 1
•Begins with awareness of the toxicity potential from serotonergic drugs
•Providers play a key role
•Computerized ordering system and medical software can help identify 
possible interactions
•No established guidelines for prevention

Strategy 3
•Before prescribing a serotonergic drug and at checkups , ask patients 
about OTC drug, herbal, and illicit or recreational drug use
•When prescribing, use the lowest effective dose and avoid the use of 2 
high -dose serotonin drugs at the same time
•If stopping or switching drugs , check for tapering and washout periods 
and stress careful adherence
•After prescribing, follow -upwith patients in a few days and annually

MANAGEMENTKey Management Principles
Confidential and Proprietary Information•Discontinuation of all serotonergic agents
•Supportive care to normalize vital signs
•Sedation with benzodiazepines
•Administration of serotonin antagonists
•Assess need to resume use of serotonergic 
agents after resolution of symptoms

1996;28(5):520- 526. doi:10.1016/s0196- 0644(96)70116- 6Supportive Care and Sedation for Mild Cases
•Oxygen to maintain O2saturation at ≥ 94%
•IV fluids (10 -20 mL/kg crystalloids initially) for vol depletion
•IV benzodiazepines for significant agitation, repeat every 5 to 10 min 
based on patient response
−Lorazepam 2 to 4 mg IV
−Diazepam 5 to 10 mg IV
*Butyrophenones (i.e. droperidol , haloperidol) should be avoided as 
they can inhibit sweating and release of body heat

•Cyproheptadine
−MOA: competitive histamine -1 receptor antagonist with 
nonspecific 5 -HT1A/5 -HT2A antagonistic properties and weak 
anticholinergic activity
−Available as 4 mg tablets or 2 mg/5 mL oral syrup
−Initial Adult Dose: 12 mg, then 2 mg every 2 hours if patient 
remains symptomatic (Max dose: 32 mg in 24 hours)

Other Treatments for Severe Cases
Confidential and Proprietary Information 20 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-
syndrome -serotonin -toxicity#H12•Direct- acting vasopressors (norepinephrine, epinephrine, 
phenylephrine )
•Indirect agents (dopamine) should be avoided as they must be 
metabolized to epi/norepinephrine and MAO may be inhibitedHypotension
•Aggressive benzodiazepines and nondepolarizing paralytics 
(rocuronium, vecuronium, pancuronium )+ external cooling
•Antipyretic agents (APAP) should be avoided since the hypothalamic temperature set point is not affectedHyperthermia
•Short -acting agents (esmolol, nicardipine, nitroprusside )
•Long- acting agents (propranolol) should be avoided due to rapid 
changes in BP and HRHypertensive Emergency and Tachycardia
Summary 
•Serotonin syndrome is a drug -induced condition caused by too much 
serotonin in the synapses in the brain
•In some cases, medical intervention is not needed and could be 
managed by discontinuing the drug or lowering the dose
•It is crucial for both the providers and patients to understand prevention and symptoms of serotonin syndrome for better management
