Bacillus megaterium and Study of
Enzyme Azoreductase Involved in Degradation
Abstract
Halophiles are exteremophiles able to survive in extreme conditions of salt concentration, and are gaining interest in areas 
such as industrial waste treatment .A moderately halotolerant microbe (0.5-2.5 M NaCl sustaining) was isolated from water 
sample from  Marina beach a nd was identified as Bacillus megaterium . Percenta ge dye degradation by the isolated Bacillu s 
megaterium  was found to be 64.89%. The enzyme involved in degradation Azoreductase was assayed and purified by anion 
exchange chromatography . Total activity of the purified enzyme was 36.03U. The enzyme gave a single band in the 
SDS–P AGE with a molecular weight of 65 kDa (approximately).
Key words: Azoreductase, Bacillus megaterium , Halotolerant, SDS-P AGE.
treatment of the effluents at the industrial sites,  which will be cost 
effective than the conventional methods of treatment using non-
halophilic microflora, where first the effluent has to be pretreated via 
reverse osmosis, electro dialysis, or fresh water dilution in order to make 
the effluents favourable for the non halophilic microflora to grow and act 
upon the substrates (Mar gesin and Schinner ,  2001; Peyton et al., 2002).
Azo dye Red 2G being used in this study is mainly used as  a food dye it is 
also used as a dye for coatings inks ,paper , crepe paper and fine tissue. 
The present study on the degradation of the azo dye (Red 2G) using 
halophiles was carried out with the following objectives: (i) To isolate a 
moderately halotolerant bacterial Species capable of dye degradation, 
(ii)To calculate the Percentage dye degradation by the screened bacterial 
species and (iii) To purify and characterize the Azoreductase enzyme.
Materials and methods
For the isolaton of halophilic bacteria water sample was collected in 
sterile plastic bottles from the Marina beach, Chennai the capital city of 
Tamilnadu. 1ml of the sample was serially diluted and the dilutions -1 -6
10–10  were inoculated on the nutrient agar plates (10% NaCl) by pour 
plate method, Colonies got after incubation were purified on quadrant 
streaking, purity of colony was checked by Grams staining procedure, 
the purified colonies were than streaked on the modified DSC plates 
(10–12% NaCl) [for halophiles] in order to countercheck the halophilic 
nature. The media used for the screening was the mineral salts basal 
media as the one used by Oranusi and Mbah (2005) modified in order to 
give carbon source, had deficiency of nitrogen source so that the dye can 
be utilized as a nitrogen source by microor ganisms.Introduction  
Azo dyes have been used increasingly in industries because of their ease 
and cost effectiveness in synthesis compared to natural dyes. It has been 
estimated that about 10,000 different types of dyes are being used 
industrially worldwide. During the dyeing processes about 10–90% of 
the dye stuff do not bind to the fibres and therefore, released into the 
sewage treatment system or the environment  (Zollinger 1991;  
Abdullah, et al., 2000). This implies the wide occurrence of synthetic 
dyes in dye waste waters. Most of Azo-dyes are toxic, carcinogenic, and 
mutagenic (Pinheiro et al., 2004).   Azo bonds (–NßN–) in the dyes are 
resistant to breakdown, with the potential for the persistence and 
accumulation of high-levels of dye in the environment. They are very 
stable in acidic and alkaline conditions and are resistant to temperature 
and light. However , they can be degraded by bacteria under anaerobic 
and aerobic conditions (Talarposhti et al., 2001). There are two different 
methods for bacterial Azo-dye decolorization: aerobic and  anaerobic 
mechanisms. For aerobic bacteria, they need to be acclimatized long-
term under aerobic chemostatic growth in the presence of a simple azo 
compound. Then, the bacteria synthesize an azoreductase specifically 
corresponding to the azo compound added in the presence of oxygen. In 
contrast, decolorization under anaerobic activity is relatively 
nonspecific with respect to the azo compounds involved (Pearce et al., 
2003). Halophiles are defined as the microbes requiring NaCl for 
growth. Most bacteria growing in halophilic conditions are moderately 
halophilic growing optimally within the range of 0.5–2.5M NaCl. 
Halophiles are metabolically diverse and are acquainted with the saline 
environment which is the condition of most of the industrial effluents 
containing azo dyes, so these halophiles can be used directly for the  Jahir Alam Khan

the screening media and were kept for incubation for one weak. A control 
plate was also maintained for comparison. After one weeks incubation 
the plates were observed for decolourization of the dye at and around the 
culture position. After incubation the dye decolourization was ranked on 
the basis of visual identification as Intense (+++), Moderate (++), Slight 
(+), No decolour ization (-). The isolate (S4) showing  intense 
decolourization was than identified based on the Grams staining, spore 
test, and various biochemical tests from the key cited by Aneja from the 
Bergeys manual of determinative biology .
The procedure is based on the one used by Oranusi and Ogugbue (2005). 
The standard inoculum of the isolated strain S4 giving intense 
decolourization of azo dye was prepared by inoculating it in 25 ml 
nutrient broth containing high salt concentration. The standard inoculum 
(25 ml) was than used to inoculate 225 ml mineral salts basal media in 
which 15 ml of the dye solution has been added after autoclaving. A 
control flask was also maintained. After inoculation 5 ml  of the sample 
was taken out in sterile condition and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min. 
Supernatant was taken and its optical density was determined 
spectrophotometrically (Szimatzu), at 532 nm the absorbance maxima of 
azo dye Red 2G being studied for decolourization.Thereafter the percent 
of dye decolourization on zero day was calculated by the formula 
(Oranusi  and Ogugbue, 2005).

The inoculated media was then incubated in shaking incubator at 150 
rpm. Percentage dye degradation was calculated every alternate day for 
twenty days and the above described method and formula was used every 
time.
The enzyme was produced in large quantity by the inoculation in the 
production media containing limited nitrogen source after which azo dye 
was the only source of nitrogen.

10 ml of S in nutrient broth was than inoculated in the production media 4
90 ml containing 5 ml of the stock dye solution in order to get the enzyme 
in large amount. The inoculated media in flasks were kept in the shaking 
incubator at 150 rpm for 20 days incubation. The broth was taken at the 
end of incubation time and was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 15 min. The 
supernatant was taken and was treated as crude extract.
Assay for azoreductase activity was performed using the following 
materials:
1.Potassium phosphate buffer 50mM (Reagent A).
2.Azo dye solution 0.1%, (Reagent B)3.Enzyme solution (Reagent C)
4.Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide sodium salt 
monohydrate (NADH) 2 mM (Reagent D).
The assay procedure is based on the principle that with the addition of 
NADH to the reaction mixture containing substrate, buffer and enzyme 
solution, the substrate azo dyes azo bond is degraded and there is a 
decrease in the absorbance of the dye after an initial lag phase. 
Unit Definition: One unit will reduce 1.0 µmole of azo dye per minute in 
the presence of NADH using Millimolar extinction coefficient of azo 
dye Red 2G (31.56) at pH 7.0 and 30°C temperature.

3.Enzyme activity was than calculated by the formula given above.
The enzyme purification was performed as follows: The crude extract 
was then subjected to ammonium sulphate precipitation at 80% 
saturation; this was carried out by adding 50.51g of ammonium sulphate 
to 90 ml crude extract. The precipitated enzyme was collected by 
centrifugation, and the pallet was dissolved in 10 ml of phosphate buffer 
(50 mM, pH 7.0). The solution was then desalted by dialysis against 
phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.0) overnight. 
Further purification was carried out by anion exchange chromatography , 
using DEAE anion exchanger , the enzyme was eluted by buffers in the 
range of 100–500 mM NaCl concentration. The protein concentration 
was estimated by Lowry's method of protein estimation for both crude 
extract and all the elutes of ion exchange. Molecular weight of the 
enzyme purified was determined by SDS–P AGE, running the enzyme 
along with a marker of known molecular weight.
For characterization, the purified enzyme was studied for the effect of 
temperature and pH on its activity . For the effect of temperature, during 
the azoreductase assay the different temperatures were maintained 
during the incubation time. Similarly for the effect of pH, the buffer used 
in the azoreductase assay was manipulated to get different pH values of 
interest.Azo Dye Biodegradation by Azoreductase from Bacillus megaterium , Jahir Alam Khan Full Length Article23  l  Advanced Biotech.  V ol. 10    Issue 07  l    January 2011Azo Dye Biodegradation by Azoreductase from B acillus megaterium ,  Jahir Alam Khan
up to 64.89% within 20 days. Table 3 shows the result of percentage dye 
degradation on every alternate day. As can be seen from the 
Figure 2 / Table 3 there was a continuous increase in the degradation 
percentage of dye degradation it shows that with the increase in the 
number of colonies the in the culture flask the dye was readily degraded 
by the  isolate in order to get the nitrogen source from the dye.  Results
After the serial dilution of samples and further plating on the DSC-97 
media six colonies of moderately halotolerant Bacillus  species were 
obtained which were purified by quadrant streaking. As the colonies 
were able to sustain salt concentration between (0.5 M and 2.5 M) in both 
the nutrient agar and DSC-97 (selective media for halophiles) they were 
called as moderately halotolerant.
Screening of all the six colonies was done they were ranked for the 
decolourization on the basis of visual identification as shown in Table 1. 
The formation of colourless zones around the colony indicates that the 
isolate is able to utilize the Azo dye as a source of nitrogen.
It can be seen from Table 1 that the isolate S showed maximum 4
decolourization and therefore it was selected for further studying the dye 
decolourization, purification of azoreductases and there 
characterization.
Percentage dye degradation by the isolate S was studied in detail 4
because it showed maximum decolourization in the screening media 
plates and the dye degradation percentage was calculated by the formula 
described earlier , it was found that the dye was found to be decolourized Purified   colonies

percentage dye degradation with respect to the time elapsed.
The figure 3 shows that there was a decolourization in the flask being 
inoculated with the isolate S thus showing that the microbe is involved 4
in dye degradation.
The concentration of protein in crude and purified sample was  estimated by the Lowry's method of protein estimation, a standard graph was 
plotted in order to get the concentration of the protein in the crude extract 
and the purified samples. The concentration of both the crude extract as 
well as the different elutes after ion exchange chromatography has been 
shown in the Table 4. It can be seen that the concentration of protein in 
the crude extract was 1390 µg/ml, and the maximum protein 
concentration of 610 µg/ml was found in the 100 mM elute.
Figure 4 above is the standard graph plotted by getting the 
absorbance of the known concentration of the protein, from 
this graph the concentration of the protein in the crude and 
the purified samples was easily determined by the help of 
absorbance readings of crude and purified samples.
Azoreductase assay was carried out for the crude as well as 
all the elutes of ion exchange chromatography . Table 5 
depicts the results of the assay , it can be seen that the 100 
mM elute of the ion exchange shows the maximum 
Azoreductase activity , thus it can be said that 100 mM 
elution buffer eluted out the maximum amount of enzyme in 
the ion exchange chromatography . This 100 mM elute was 
thus called as purified enzyme, and thus was characterized, 
for the effect of pH, and Temperature on its activity , and  
finally its molecular weight was determined by running it in 
SDS –PAGE along with a marker of known molecular 
weight.  
As depicted by the results (Table 6) of effect of temperature 
on the enzyme activity it can be said that the Azoreductase 
enzyme purified from Bacillus megaterium has a 0 0
temperature optimum ranging between 30 C and 45 C. This 
Optimum is quite good for the degradation of the azo dye containing 
effluents which normally have this range of temperature.
Figure 5 is the graphical representation of the effect of temperature on the 
activity of the Azoreductase purified from Bacillu s megaterium. 
The results shown in the Table 7 & Figure 6 clearly depicts that the 
Azoreductase purified from the Bacillus megaterium  has  a pH optimum 
ranging between pH 7-9 but the enzyme was found to be showing 
maximum activity at pH-7.
Molecular weight of the Azoreductase purified from Bacillus 
megaterium was determined by running the pure sample of Azoreductase 
in the SDS PAGE along with a marker BSA  (Bovine serum albumin) of 
molecular weight 66k Da. As seen in the Fig. 7, after the staining and 
destaining procedures a band of pure protein is present nearly parallel to 1.

Discussion
The isolate decolorized the dye substrates and Decolourizing efficiency 
was dependent on the growth of the isolate in the flask (Table3).There 
was neither growth nor decolourization in the control flasks. This 
showed that the decolourization was due to the metabolic activity of the 
organisms and not due to any abiotic factors.
Halophiles have been reported to be involved in the dye decolourization 
(SalahUddin et al., 2007) .The moderately halotolerant Bacillu s 
sp.isolated in this study decolourized the azo dye Red 2G to a extent of 
64.89%.This rate of decolourization may be due to the high metabolic 
diversity being seen in the halophiles due to there e xtremophilic nature 
(Oren et al., 1992; Ventosa et al., 1998).
Decolourization of synthetic dyes is due to the cleavage of the 
chromophoric group which generates colourless metabolic Blank

V ol. 10    Issue 07  l    January 2011intermediates. This intermediate metabolites of the dye substrates are 
aromatic amines (Ganesh, 1992; Brown and DeVito, 1993). The results 
obtained in Table 3 show that the chromophoric groups of the dye were 
cleaved. The cleavage of the chromophoric group of dyes is a reduction 
process which requires redox equivalents (electron donars) that transfer 
electrons to the chromophoric group (electron acceptor) of dyes (Russ 
et al., 2000).
 The dye substrates were the only source of nitrogen left for the microbe 
after the initial utilization of the limited nitrogen source available in the 
media, the increase in the cell density as was visible in the broth 
evidenced that the isolate was utilizing the nitrogen available in the form 
of dye substrate. Bacterial utilization of azo dyes as a source of carbon, 
and energy have been reported (Yatome et al. 1993; Dykes et al., 1994) as 
nitrogen source (Coughlin et al., 1997) and as corbon,ener gy and 
nitrogen source (Oranusi and Mbah, 2005).This study is perhaps one of 
the few reports in the literature on the utilization of azo dye Red 2G as  a 
source of nitrogen.
Aromatic amines generated by the reductive cleavage of the azodyes are 
potentially toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic (Ganesh, 1992; Brown 
and Devito, 1993).The utilization of the dye as a sole source of nitrogen 
may detoxify the parent compounds or there intermediates. 
Detoxification of the azodyes by microbial cultures or laccase was 
attributed to the conversion of azo-nitrogen to non-toxic metabolites 
(Chivukula and Renganathan, 1995; Abadulla et al., 2000).
The initial step of biodegradation of azo dyes is a reductive cleavage of 
the azo group under anaerobic conditions this reaction is catalyzed by a 
variety of biological systems and leads to the accumulation of aromatic 
amines (Ganesh, 1992; Brown and Devito, 1993). It is thought that under 
anaerobic conditions azo dyes can interact rather non-specifically with 
the compounds of the electron transport chain and thereby serve as 
artificial electron acceptors. Molecular oxygen inhibits this reaction 
since the electron do not reach the azo dyes when the natural acceptor is 
present (Wuhrmann et al.,1980) and since the postulated intermediates 
of the reaction hydrazine and /or the azo anion free radical, are 
reoxidized by oxygen. Exceptions to the oxygen sensitivity of the 
biological azo reduction have been represented by the azoreductases 
from the rat liver cytosol (Huang et.al.,  1979) and Orange II 
Azoreductase from  Pseudomonas  KF46. Azoreductase,the enzyme 
characterized in the present report is another oxygen insensitive 
Azoreductase.
In the present study the Azoreductase from moderately halotolerant 
Bacillus megaterium  was purified by a combination of ammonium 
sulphate precipitation, anion exchange chromatography , and the specific 
activity of purified enzyme was 6 U. Nachiyar et al. (2005) reported a 
specific activity of 23 U for Azoreductase they purified from 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  However a comparison of activity values 
from the literature is difficult since most studies are based on 
decolourization of different azo dyes. The molecular weight of the 
Azoreductase being purified from Bacillus megaterium  was determined 
to be 65 kDa (approximately). Previously molecular weights for azo 
reductases have been reported to be 30 kDa from Pseudomonas  KF46 
(Zimmermann et al., 1982), 85 kDa from Staphylococcus aureus 
(Huizong et al.,  2005), 61.6±1.4 from Bacillus  sp. Strain S F (Jurgen et 
al., 2004) 29 kDa from Pseudomonas aerugenosa (Nachiyar et al., 2005) 
21.5 kDa from Bacillus  cereus (Pricelius et al., 2007). The optimum 
temperature and pH range for the activity of the Azoreductase being 0 0
studied here was found to be between 30C  and 45C  pH 7–8 
respectively , which is similar to the temperature and pH optima  found in 
the literature (Hu, 2001; Huizhong et al., 2005).
Conclusion
Finally based on the present study it can be concluded that Halophilic 
microflora can be a good source for the degradation of azo compounds 
present in the industrial effluents which are polluting the aquatic life as 
well as are equally harmful to animals and human beings. Halophiles 
have greater metabolic diversity and are able to easily survive in the 
hypersaline wastewaters effluents being discarded by the industries in 
which non-halophilic microflora can not survive and thus the effluent 
has first to be treated in order to make the effluent suitable for the growth 
of non-halophiles, which is a bit costlier and time consuming process, in 
such cases halophiles can be directly used without any pretreatment of 
the effluents. Azoreductase purified from  Bacillus megaterium  here is 
oxygen insensitive and thus treatment of effluents can be performed in 
very less cost at the industrial site as compared to the anaerobic treatment 
which requires large input.
