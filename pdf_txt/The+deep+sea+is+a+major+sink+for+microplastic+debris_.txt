1. Summary
Marine debris, mostly consisting of plastic, is a global problem,
negatively impacting wildlife, tourism and shipping. However,despite the durability of plastic, and the exponential increase
in its production, monitoring data show limited evidence of
concomitant increasing concentrations in marine habitats. Thereappears to be a considerable proportion of the manufactured
plastic that is unaccounted for in surveys tracking the fate
of environmental plastics. Even the discovery of widespreadaccumulation of microscopic fragments (microplastics) in oceanic
gyres and shallow water sediments is unable to explain the
missing fraction. Here, we show that deep-sea sediments are
a likely sink for microplastics. Microplastic, in the form of
ﬁbres, was up to four orders of magnitude more abundant (perunit volume) in deep-sea sediments from the Atlantic Ocean,
Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean than in contaminated sea-
surface waters. Our results show evidence for a large andhitherto unknown repository of microplastics. The dominance of
microﬁbres points to a previously underreported and unsampled
plastic fraction. Given the vastness of the deep sea and theprevalence of microplastics at all sites we investigated, the deep-
sea ﬂoor appears to provide an answer to the question— where is
all the plastic?

Plastics are extremely durable synthetic polymers, yet more than 30% are made into disposable items
such as packaging, which are typically discarded within a year of manufacture [ 1]. The associated throw-
away culture has led to an escalating plastic waste management problem, and widespread accumulation
of plastic debris in the natural environment. Debris is now present on shorelines and at the sea surface
from pole to pole [ 1,2]. It has major environmental impacts and is recognized as one of the key challenges
of our century [ 1–3]. However, despite extensive environmental monitoring, there is little evidence of
the expected increasing abundance of plastic debris in natural habitats. Only two studies [ 4,5]r e p o r ta n
increase over time. Both these papers focused on microplastics, which have not typically been included inroutine monitoring, and are likely to represent a largely undocumented accumulation of plastic debris.
Yet, even for microplastic pollution, temporal trends are unresolved in the majority of datasets [ 6]. In
addition, a recent study [ 7] suggested that surface water plastic accumulation was tens of thousands
of tonnes less than expected, and acknowledged that resolving the fate of the missing plastic is a
fundamental issue [ 8].
Plastics can be denser (e.g. acrylic) or lighter (e.g. polypropylene) than seawater. Those that
are buoyant ﬂoat when ﬁrst entering the sea, so historically attention has focused on the
accumulation on shorelines and at the sea surface [ 9]. However, because of fouling by organisms
and adherence of particles, positively buoyant plastics can, over a timescale of weeks to months,
become negatively buoyant and sink [ 10]. Some studies have shown the accumulation of large plastic
items in the deep sea [ 11,12], and one has reported the presence of microplastic fragments at low
densities [ 13].
Here, we present results from a global analysis of deep-sea sediment collected by two independent
research teams during seven research cruises between September 2001 and August 2012, in theMediterranean Sea, SW Indian Ocean and NE Atlantic Ocean (spanning subtropical to subpolar waters).
The purpose of this study was to quantify the abundance and extent of microplastic contamination at a
range of depths and locations in the deep sea.
3. Methods
3.1. Samplecollection
Deep-sea sediment cores from environments such as submarine canyons, continental slopes, basinsand seamounts were collected independently by the University of Barcelona and the Natural History
Museum, London. In addition, coral specimens were sampled on seamounts ( ﬁgure 1 and table 1 ).
Sampling depth ranged down to 3500 m, but most sites were at around 1000 m and were at least 9 km
horizontal and 200 m vertical distance from each other. In total, 12 quantitative sediment cores and four
qualitative coral samples were collected.
Sediment cores 1, 2 and 4–9 were collected by the University of Barcelona on board the research
vessels Jan Mayen (Norway), Garcia del Cid (Spain), Sarmiento de Gamboa (Spain) Hespérides (Spain) and
Aegaeo (Greece). Ten centimetre diameter cores were obtained from megacorers or boxcores that were
subsequently subsampled. The top 1 cm of the sediment cores was sliced on board the ship and then
frozen at −20
◦C. Upon arrival in the laboratory, the sediment was freeze-dried and stored at room
temperature in sealed containers for a maximum of 12 years before sending to Plymouth Universityfor extraction of microplastics.
Sediment cores 3 and 10–12 and corals 13–16 were sampled by the Natural History Museum,
London. Sampling was performed during research cruises JC66 and JC76T aboard the R.R.S. James
Cook (UK). Samples were collected by remotely operated vehicle (ROV) Kiel6000 (Germany) or
ISIS (UK), using push-cores or a megacorer for sediment samples or ROV manipulator arms
for the corals. Cores were of 5.7, 7.4 or 10 cm internal diameter, respectively. Once recoveredon board the ship, cores were immediately sliced at 2 cm and 5 cm using a metal plate.
Sediment horizons were preserved in either DESS [ 14] or 4% formalin in sealed containers for
a maximum of a year. All preservation and processing ﬂuids were ﬁltered through a 32 µm
sieve prior to adding them to the sediment. Filtered (5 µm) fresh water and seawater were
used to wash equipment, and water from both fresh and salt water supplies was sampled for1 h daily through a 32 µm sieve and screened for the presence of microplastic ﬁbres, but none
was seen.3rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R.Soc.opensci. 1:140317.................................................

3.2. Sampleprocessing
All sample processing (extraction and picking) was conducted in a clean laboratory, where extreme
care was taken to avoid any contamination. Checks for contamination during processing were made
by exposing damp ﬁlter paper to the air in the laboratory, whenever samples were open to the laboratory4rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R.Soc.opensci. 1:140317.................................................Table1.DetailsofsamplinglocationandquantityofmicroplasticsfoundintheNorthAtlanticOcean,MediterraneanSeaandSWIndian

environment. As an additional precaution, those handling the samples wore only natural ﬁbre clothing,
and were protected with 100% cotton laboratory coats and headwear, and latex gloves, for all laboratoryprocessing and during the JC76T research cruise.
Microplastics were extracted from the sediment using two methodologies. For samples 1, 2 and 4–9,
extraction was done by Plymouth University (PU) using a concentrated NaCl solution and ﬁltering withthree sequential extractions [ 5]. The PU method employs supernatant ﬁltering through a Whatman GF/A
ﬁlter. For samples 3 and 10–12, particle extraction was conducted at the Natural History Museum (NHM)
using an adapted Ludox-TM 40 extraction method [ 15] employing eight centrifuge cycles and a 32 µm
sieve to separate the microplastics from the sand grains. The substances chosen to isolate the ﬁbres (NaCl
or Ludox-TM 40) had similar speciﬁc gravities, namely 1.2 and 1.16, for PU and NHM, respectively. We
are therefore conﬁdent that the same fractions and types of microplastics were isolated.
Using an entomological pin, microplastic ﬁbres from coral specimens 13–16 were removed under
a binocular microscope and placed into clean vials containing Millipore water. The ﬁbres were not
extracted quantitatively. The corals were of different sizes, and not all ﬁbres present on the corals
were removed, therefore just the presence or absence of microplastic accumulation on living coral
was recorded.
All sediment samples were examined under a binocular microscope, and any objects that were of
unnatural appearance based on shape and colour (potential microplastics) were transferred to sealed
containers and subsequently identiﬁed [ 5] by spectrometry.
3.3. Microplasticanalyses
A Bruker IFS66 Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer with a mercury cadmium telluride
detector operating in the 4000–600 cm−1wavenumber range was used for object identiﬁcation. A Specac
DC2 Diamond compression cell (2 mm in diameter) was used to allow transmission of the IR beam to thedetector. Bruker’s O
PUS 5.5 spectroscopy software was used for measurement, processing and evaluation
of the IR spectra. Matches with quality index greater than or equal to 0.7 were accepted. Matches with
quality index less than 0.7, but greater than or equal to 0.6 were individually inspected and interpreted5rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R.Soc.opensci. 1:140317.................................................

based on the closeness of their absorption frequencies to those of chemical bonds in the known polymers.
Matches with quality index less than 0.6 were rejected. We added the spectra of potential contaminants,
such as those from waterproofs and laboratory gloves used during sample collection and processing,
to the Plymouth University FT-IR library in order to eventually eliminate any contamination from the
data. No matches with these materials were found in any of the samples. In addition, we checked all
residue sediment for the larger plastic particles described in Van Cauwenberghe et al .[13]. None were
seen. Protocols were implemented to prevent plastic contamination from the processing environment
and controls to monitor air and water supplies were taken during all processing phases.
There has only been one previous report of microplastics in the deep sea, which documented very
low abundance [ 13]. The previous study employed different separation methods to those used here and
critically did not enumerate microplastic ﬁbres, which are the most numerous type of particle present in
shallow water habitats and in some biota [ 5]. We ran a preliminary trial to compare methods used by both
studies, by splitting some of our deep-sea sediment samples and analysing them using both approaches.
We found that our approach and our recording of microﬁbres yielded substantially greater abundance
of microplastic particles, whereas the other method [ 13] underestimated the microplastic concentration
(electronic supplementary material).
4. Results
Identiﬁcation by FT-IR spectroscopy conﬁrmed that microplastics were abundant in all 12 sediment
samples and all coral samples. The microplastics were all ﬁbrous in shape, were commonly 2–3 mm in
length and less than 0.1 mm in diameter (electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S1). Plastic microﬁbreabundance in the sediments ranged from 1.4 to 40 pieces per 50 ml (mean ±s.e.: 13.4 ±3.5; ﬁgure 2 ), and
samples from four locations in the Indian Ocean showed that microplastics had also accumulated on
the surface of octocorals. The microﬁbres were mostly blue, black, green or red, although vibrant colourssuch as pink, purple and turquoise were also seen. Rayon, which is a man-made non-plastic polymer, was
detected in all the samples (electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S2 a). It contributed to 56.9% of the
total number of ﬁbres seen and was more than twice as abundant as polyester (electronic supplementarymaterial, ﬁgure S2 b). Of the remaining ﬁbres, polyester was the most prevalent (53.4%), followed by other
plastics (34.1%), which included polyamides and acetate, then acrylic (12.4%) ( ﬁgure 2 ).
5. Discussion
Because of the lack of replicate samples, small sample size and differences in methodology, no attempt
can be made to statistically compare microplastic abundance and composition between samples andmake conclusions on patterns observed. However, we can and do compare the mean abundance reported
here with that of other studies, highlighting the ubiquity of the microplastic presence and emphasizing
that the microplastics reported were all ﬁbres.6rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R.Soc.opensci. 1:140317.................................................Table 2.Concentrationsofmicroplasticspreviouslyreportedinshallowwatermarinesedimentsandsurfacewatersworldwide.This

The prevalence of plastic microﬁbres in all sediment cores and on all coral colonies examined suggests
this contaminant is ubiquitous in the deep sea. Furthermore, the wide variety of polymer types detectedreveals that the accumulation and deposition of microﬁbres in the deep sea is complex and that they arise
from a variety of domestic and industrial sources.
The microplastics, in the form of microﬁbres, were found in the deep sea in similar abundance
to those reported in intertidal or shallow subtidal sediments (respectively, mean ±s.e.: 3.3 ±2.7 and
6.4±2.7 per 50 ml; table 2 ). While different methods are used to sample surface waters and sediments,
a qualitative comparison indicated four orders of magnitude greater abundance per unit volume indeep-sea sediments compared with heavily contaminated surface water gyres (1.1 ×10
−4per 50 ml;
table 2 ). Our data show that, if extrapolated and using the most conservative estimates, 4 billion ﬁbres
per km2would be present in Indian Ocean seamount sediment. It is notable that ﬁbres represented the
largest proportion of microplastics seen in other studies based on sediment analyses, whereas sea-surface
studies most often report larger fragments. At present, it is not possible to determine whether this is a
true reﬂection of the relative abundance of different microplastic fractions in different substrata or if it is
an artefact of differences in sampling methodology [ 23].
Polyester, which forms the largest proportion of plastic microﬁbres in this study, is often the most
common polymer detected in some other microplastics studies [ 17,24–26]. However, a study which
sampled the water column concluded that other plastics such as polypropylene and polyethylene are
most abundant [ 27]. Most of the polymer types recorded in this study are negatively buoyant, and
will therefore eventually sink. This may account for the difference in microﬁbre composition between
this benthic study and the water column study. The plastic polymers found in this study are used in a
wide range of domestic and industrial applications, including packaging, textiles and electronics, whichindicates diverse sources. However, the precise origin of individual microplastic debris cannot currently
be established. Rayon is not a plastic, but we include it in our results, because it is a man-made semi-
synthetic material and widely reported as present in the marine environment. It is used in cigaretteﬁlters, personal hygiene products and clothing, and is introduced to the marine environment through
sewage, including from the washing of clothes. It has been reported in ﬁsh (57.8% of synthetic particles
ingested) [ 24] and in ice cores (54%) [ 25], in similar proportions to those reported here.7rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R.Soc.opensci. 1:140317.................................................There is precedent for the transport of natural particulates from shallow water to the deep sea, so
similar processes may be involved with microplastics. Some negatively buoyant particles will sink;
however, because of surface tension and oceanographic currents, most plastics are initially held at the sea
surface. Colonization by organisms, adherence to phytoplankton and the aggregation with organic debrisand small particles in the form of marine snow will eventually enhance settling. In addition, a number
of oceanographic processes could aid in the transfer of microplastics to depth. These processes include
dense shelf water cascading [ 28,29], severe coastal storms [ 30], offshore convection [ 31,32] and saline
subduction [ 33]. All these induce vertical and horizontal transfers of large volumes of particle loaded
waters, including a full spectrum of grain sizes (from sand to clay), as well as litter and contaminants,
from shallow ocean layers and coastal regions to deeper ones [ 11–13], with submarine canyons acting
as preferential conduits [ 34]. Submarine topographic features may also enhance downwelling ﬂows and
increase the retention of microplastics at particular locations such as Taylor columns over seamounts [ 35].
Microplastic fragments are also more likely than larger items to be inﬂuenced by advection and, moregenerally, circulation patterns at all ocean levels, because of their small size. Hence, ocean dynamics can
explain the accumulation of plastics in the deep sea.
6. Conclusion
Our results show for the ﬁrst time, to the best of our knowledge, that substantial quantities of
microplastic debris have accumulated in the deep sea. Given the extent of this habitat (more than 300million km
2)[36], it therefore seems likely that the deep sea is a sink for this debris. Thus, we have
started to elucidate the location of the missing ocean plastic [ 7]. Plastic accumulation is a global concern
because of its effects on marine organisms. The discovery of previously under-reported microplasticssuggests that there may be even greater plastic accumulation than was previously suspected. In
contrast with studies on the effects of large plastic debris, which mostly document entanglement
and ingestion [ 37], there are few studies examining the biological effects of microplastics. A range of
organisms are known to ingest microplastics, and there is concern this could result in physical and/or
toxicological harm [ 38,39]. The extent to which microplastics could have harmful effects will most likely
be inﬂuenced by their relative abundance. The discovery of substantial quantities in deep-sea sedimentsis of considerable relevance to our understanding of the potential of these particles to cause harm in the
marine environment.
To date, our understanding regarding the dynamics of transport, accumulation and associated
spatial distribution has been extremely limited, and the data presented here, together with that of
Van Cauwenberghe et al. [13], provide the ﬁrst evidence of global sinks for microplastic debris, a
theory previously suggested for larger plastic debris items [ 40]. It is now crucial to establish consistent
methodologies to allow robust temporal and spatial comparisons, to address how abundance and
composition vary with depth, location, topography and habitat, and apply these data to the alreadycomplex oceanographic transport models available for some oceans, which have successfully been used
to predict surface plastic accumulation [ 6]. In addition, the elucidation of the physical and toxicological
effects of microplastics is also required. In summary, further data collection is required to properlyestablish the impact of microplastic particles on deep-sea communities and related ecosystem services.
