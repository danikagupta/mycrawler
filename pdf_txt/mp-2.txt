Bioremediation using a variety of microbes for the degradation of xenobiotics seems a green solution 
to the problem of environmental pollution. Microbes have been gifted by nature with the ability of 
degrading a wide spectrum of environmental pollutants. Different fungi have the potentials to degrade 
complex and recalcitrant organic compounds into simpler fragments; sometimes achieving complete 
mineralization. In this work, we have investigated the decolorization and degradation of a 
triphenylmethane dye, malachite green by two fungal microorganisms, Aspergillus flavus and Alternaria 
solani. Both the species were able to decolorize different concentrations of malachite green (10 to 50 
M) almost completely (> 96 %) within 6 days.  
 
Key words: Alternaria solani, Aspergillus flavus, Decolorization, degradation, malachite green. 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Removal of dyes from textile waste effluents has been 
carried out by physical, chemical and biological methods, 
such as flocculation, membrane filtration, electrochemical 
techniques, ozonation, coagulation, adsorption and fun-
gal discoloration (Fu and Tiraraghavan, 2004). Fungal 
bioremediation is becoming an attractive option for 
removal of dyes from industrial effluents as microorga-
nisms are nature’s tools for cleaning the environment. 
Without fungi and their decomposing activities, the world 
would have become a heap of dead bodies of plants and 
animals. 
Removal of dyes from industrial waste waters is of 
global concern because dyes cause many problems in 
aqueous environments. Dyes may significantly affect 
photosynthetic activity in aquatic life because of reduced 
light penetration and may also be toxic to some aquatic 
life due to the presence of aromatics, metals, chlorides, 
etc. (Daneshvar et al., 2007). Malachite Green (MG) is a 
triphenylmethane dye, which is most widely used for 
coloring purposes, amongst all other dyes of its category 
(Gupta et al., 2004). MG is highly toxic to human beings 
as it affects the immune  and  reproductive  systems  and

environmental point of view, there is concern about the 
fate of MG and its reduced form, leuco malachite green in 
aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems since they occur as 
contaminants and are potential human health hazards. 
In recent years, there has been an intensive research 
on fungal decolorization of dye waste waters. It is turning 
into a promising alternative to replace or supplement 
present treatment processes (Ramya et al., 2007). Biolo-
gical processes have potential to convert or degrade the 
pollutant into water, carbon dioxide and various salts of 
inorganic nature. In this work, we have investigated the 
decolorization and degradation abilities of two fungal 
species, Aspergillus flavus and Alternaria solani for 
malachite green. 
 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Fungal cultures 
 
Pure cultures of A. flavus and A. solani were grown in Petri dishes 
for 3 days using Czapek Dox Agar medium. This medium contains 
30 g sucrose, 3 g NaNO3, 0.5 g KCl, 0.5 g MgSO4.7H2O, 0.01g 
FeSO4.7H2O, 1 g K2HPO4 and 15 g agar per liter. Final pH of the 
medium is 7.3 ± 0.2 at 25oC. After 3 days, fresh cultures were 
grown in liquid medium (the same medium but without agar) in 250 
mL Erlenmeyer flasks again for 3 days.

Decolorization study 
 
For decolorization and degradation study, 250 mL Erlenmeyer 
flasks containing 125 mL solutions of malachite green prepared in 
the same growth medium were inoculated with the fungal biomass 
grown in the liquid medium. These flasks were kept in a static 
incubator at 37.5oC providing micro-aerobic conditions. After a 
treatment of 6 days, the decolorized solutions were filtered through 
0.20 m filters and centrifuged at 4400 rpm for 5 min. The 
supernatants were analyzed spectrophotometrically using UV-
Visible spectrophotometer (UV-1700, Shimadzu). 
To know about the effect of dye concentration on % 
decolorization, different initial dye concentrations i.e., 10, 20, 30, 40 
and 50 M solutions were used. Similarly in order to know about the  
effect of C source  on % decolorization, different C sources, that  is, 
glucose, fructose and starch were used instead of sucrose in the 
decolorization medium. In one case, no C source was used in the 
decolorization medium in order to know whether the 
microorganisms can use the dye as sole source of C and energy or 
not. 
Each experiment was conducted in duplicate and mean values 
were taken.

DISCUSSION 
 
Microbial decolorization of malachite green has been 
investigated by a few authors. Youssef et al. (2008) have 
studied the decolorization of malachite green by 
Acremonium kiliense. According to them 95.4% MG was 
decolorized within 72 h when the concentration of the dye 
was 5 mg L-1 but decolorization was only 35.48% when 
the dye concentration was doubled. They have attributed 
this trend to be due to inhibition of fungal growth at high 
dye concentration. Biodegradation of malachite green by 
Kocuria rosea MTCC 1532 has been studied by Parshetti 
et al. (2006). According to them 50 mg L-1 MG  was  com-  Ali et al.        1575

pletely decolorized under static anoxic conditions within 5 
h by bacteria K. rosea MTCC 1532; however decolo-
rization was not observed at shaking condition. Ren et al. 
(2006) have investigated the decolorization of different 
dyes including malachite green by Aeromonas 
hydrophila. According to them 50 mg L-1 MG was 90% 
decolorized within 10 h under aerobic culture conditions. 
Decolorization of malachite green by Citrobacter sp. has 
been studied by An et al. (2002). According to their 
results, 100 M MG was 80 % decolorized within 1 h. 
The present study has revealed that A. flavus and A. 
solani are able to decolorize 50 M malachite green by 
97.43 and 96.91% respectively within 6 days. Dye 
concentration in the range of 10 to 50 M had no 
significant effect on % decolorization in case of both the 
species. It is also clear that C source in the decolorization 
medium has no significant effect on % decolorization in 
both cases. 
 
 
Use of malachite green as sole source of C 
 
Both the microorganisms were able to use the dye as 
sole source of C and energy. When the dye was used as 
the sole source of C in the decolorization medium, A. 
flavus decolorized a 30 M solution by 99.78% and A. 
solani by 91.72% within 6 days. This shows that both the 
species are able to use the dye for their growth. 
 
 
Mechanism of decolorization 
 
The UV-Visible spectral study of the decolorized solutions 
showed that the max of the dye has changed significantly. 
In case of A. flavus, the original peak (at 617 nm) com-
pletely disappeared and another new single peak 
appeared at 387 nm, which shows that the mechanism of    1576         Afr. J. Biotechnol. 
 
 
 
decolorization is biodegradation. In case of A. solani, 
peaks were recorded at 352, 617 and 618 nm from which 
it can be inferred that decolorization occurred through 
both biodegradation and biosorption. 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
It may be urged that both A. flavus and A. solani are good 
potential candidates for the decolorization of malachite 
green and possibly other dyes. The ability of A. solani to 
decolorize acid violet 19 has already been established 
(Ali and Muhammad, 2008). Further studies in this 
domain are valuable to use these microorganisms for the 
decolorization of real dye waste waters (which are 
complex mixtures of many dyes) and to know about the 
nature and fate of the degradation products.
