Abstract
D0bleaching wastewater from E. globulus Kraft pulping industry was treated by Fenton and photo-Fenton processes. The
aim was to optimize the operational conditions for adsorbable organic halides (AOX) removal, namely oxidant concentration,
[H2O2], catalyst concentration, [Fe2+], and treatment time, using the central composite experimental design (CCED) tool.
Temperature and pH were set at 60oC and 2, respectively, which are similar to the natural values of the D0bleaching
wastewater. Both processes showed potential to remove AOX from D0with 177 - 178 mM H 2O2and 10 min reaction time.
Maximum AOX removal was 85 % for the Fenton process with 8.5 mM Fe2+, and 95 % for the photo-Fenton process with
2.0 mM Fe2+and UV irradiance 142 W.m−2. For both methods, the only statistically significant variable (p=0.05) was the
concentration of oxidant, [H 2O2].

1. Introduction
Amongst the variety of potentially toxic compounds found in wastewater from pulp and paper industry (PP),
possibly the most concerning ones are adsorbable organic halides (AOX) which are a family of environmentally
persistent, bioaccumulative chemicals produced when the halogens react with organic matter. Reported AOX toxic
effects on fish and zooplankton included respiratory stress, mixed function oxygenase activity, carcinogenicity and
mutagenicity, liver damage, effect on sexual maturation and ability to reproduce, and even lethal effects [1–4].
Advanced oxidation processes (AOP) have been reported to reduce organic load, toxicity and the content of
recalcitrant compounds such as AOX from wastewaters [5,6]. Such remediation techniques involve the generation

of highly reactive and non-selective hydroxyl radicals that attack the organic compounds [7]. The major drawback
of AOP are the large amounts of chemical reagents and electrical energy required [8–10].
Fenton process is a fast and effective AOP based on the catalytic (Fe2+) dissociation of the oxidant (H 2O2)
into hydroxyl radicals (OH•) capable of oxidizing strong organic pollutants [7,10–12]. The generally accepted
mechanism of the Fenton reaction is well described by Eqs. (1)–(4), as stated by Torrades et al. [10].

Fe3++H2O2↔FeOOH++H+(2)
Fe(OH)2+→HO.
2+Fe2+(3)

2→Fe2++O2+H+(4)
The main disadvantages of the Fenton process are the high cost associated to chemicals and the formation of
an iron (oxidized) sludge that requires a management strategy and additional cost to be handled/disposed [12–14].
UV light is an efficient way to improve regeneration of Fe2+by photo-reduction of Fe3+(Eq. (5)) increasing the
production of OH•[7,10,14].
Fe(OH)2++hν→Fe2++OH·(5)
This variation to the conventional Fenton is known as photo-Fenton and has been reported to improve the
degradation of organic pollutants while reducing the consumption of Fe2+, the turbidity and the production of
iron sludge [5].
This work aimed to optimize the application of Fenton and photo-Fenton processes to maximize AOX removal
from a real PP wastewater. Since AOX is formed essentially in the pulp bleaching stage, this work focused only
on AOX removal from acidic bleaching streams before mixing with the other process wastewaters. This is a novel
feature that could mean lower volumes of wastewater to treat, less chemical consumption and lower economic cost.
2. Materials and methods
The wastewater was collected in a Portuguese PP industry processing Eucalyptus globulus Kraft pulps in a
4-stage elemental chlorine-free bleaching process (D 0EpD1D2). The wastewater from the first chlorine dioxide (D)
bleaching stage, D 0, had an AOX content of 124 ±12.0 mg L−1.
Central composite experimental design (CCED) was used to plan the experiments aiming to assess the conditions
that will yield the most desirable response (AOX removal) without performing unnecessary experiments, thus
minimizing resource consumption and costs [10,15].
Considering the underlying principles of the Fenton and photo-Fenton processes, the independent variables
(factors) that may affect AOX removal from the D 0bleaching stream are pH, temperature, [H 2O2], [Fe2+] and
reaction time. However, pH of the D 0bleaching stream was between 2–2.5, which falls within the optimum
range reported in the literature for these processes [7,14,16]; moreover, temperature seems to have little effect
on Fenton/photo-Fenton removal efficiency [7,15], so the experiments were carried out at the usual temperature of
D0streams in the PP industry, i.e. at 60 ±2◦C. Accordingly, the independent variables optimized in this work
were [H 2O2], [Fe2+] and reaction time. The tested ranges for each factor are shown in Table 1, according to CCED
methodology.

Experiments were performed in a quartz Peschl MPDS Basic Batch-L Photoreactor equipped with a 150 W
UV TQ150 lamp, using 0.5 L wastewater in each experiment. H 2O2was used as an analytical grade 30% solution772 J.P . Ribeiro, C.C. Marques, I. Portugal et al. / Energy Reports 6 (2020) 770–775
(w/v), while Fe2+was used as FeSO 4.7H 2O. After the pre-established treatment time, samples were taken from the
photoreactor and sodium sulphite Na 2SO3was immediately added for reaction quenching.
AOX quantification was performed by adsorption into activated carbon, combustion of the loaded carbon and
coulometric titration, in accordance with EN 16166:2012, ISO 9562:2004 and EPA Method 1650C. For this purpose,
a Thermo TOC 1200 AOX/Total Carbon Analyser was used.
Regarding data treatment, results from experiments were fitted to a second order polyonomy, according to Eq. (6),
where Zis the fitted response; k,a,b,c, (. . . ) to iare regression coefficients; and x,y,zare the independent variables
studied.

Analysis of variance (two-way ANOV A) was performed to test whether the variables and interactions between
them significantly influenced the measured response.
3. Results and discussion
The results for AOX removal from the D 0bleaching wastewater stream by Fenton process are shown in Fig. 1.
The fitted model had an R2=0.70.
Fig. 1. AOX removal (%) from D0 bleaching wastewater (C AOX_D0 ≈124 mg L−1, pH=2, T=60◦C) by Fenton process, as function
of: (a) [H 2O2] and [Fe2+], for t =10 min; (b) [H 2O2] and t, for [Fe2+]=4 mM; (c) [Fe2+] and t, for [H 2O2]=137.5 mM.
It seems that [Fe2+] only influenced AOX removal for [H 2O2]≤70–80 mM, as shows Fig. 1(a). For oxidant
concentrations above those values, AOX removal increased mainly with increasing [H 2O2], which indeed was the
only statistically significant variable (p <0.01) with 95% confidence (p =0.05). This is not an unprecedented
result for different substrates degraded [7,9,12]. The influence of each variable in the response is well represented
by the Pareto chart of effects (Fig. 2).

Maximum AOX removal around 90% was reached for [H 2O2]≥140 mM. Similar response surfaces were
obtained for treatment times above 10 min showing the little effect of time on AOX removal (p ≥0.45). Moreover,
Fig. 1(b) shows that for treatment times below 30 min the increment of [H 2O2] clearly promotes higher AOX
removal, from removals below 30% to a maximum around 80%–85% for a fixed [Fe2+] of 4 mM. These results
were similar to those reported by Catalkaya and Kargi [17] - 89% AOX removal for biologically treated pulp mill
wastewater for t =30 min - and better than those obtained by Van Aken et al. [12] – 66% AOX removal from
graphical industry wastewater for t =24 h. Fig. 1(c) shows the effect of the [Fe2+] on AOX removal at a fixed
[H2O2]=137.5 mM. Although it seems that [Fe2+] between 6 and 12 mM improves AOX removal, this variable
was not statistically significant (p ≈0.10). The fitted polynomial model had however a weak R2of≈0.70, which
means it only explains 70% of the response variability. Nevertheless, it must be stated that the apparent decrease
treatment efficiency for higher [Fe2+] would not be unprecedented–P ´erez et al. [9] observed that iron concentration
above≈7 mM would be detrimental to TOC removal.
The results obtained for AOX removal from D 0bleaching wastewater by the photo-Fenton process are shown in
Fig. 3. The fitted model had an R2=0.95.
Fig. 3. AOX removal (%) from the D 0bleaching wastewater (C AOX_D0 ≈124 mg L−1, pH=2, T=60◦C) by photo-Fenton process, as
function of: (a) [H 2O2] and [Fe2+], for t =10 min; (b) [H 2O2] and t, for [Fe2+]=4 mM; (c) [Fe2+] and t, for [H 2O2]=137.5 mM.
AOX removal by photo-Fenton process was mainly affected by [H 2O2] (p<0.0001): the higher the oxidant
concentration, the higher the AOX removal from the D 0bleaching wastewater. The Pareto chart of effects depicted
in Fig. 4 highlights the dependence of AOX removal on the oxidant concentration.
Fig. 4. Pareto chart of effects of [H 2O2], [Fe2+] and treatment time on AOX removal from D 0bleaching stream by photo-Fenton.
Fig. 3(a), corresponding to t =10 min, shows maximum AOX removal ≈90% obtained for [H 2O2]≥100 mM,
regardless of [Fe2+]. This means that equal AOX removal by the photo-Fenton process can be attained with smaller
amounts of chemicals when comparing to Fenton process. For the later, ≈90% removal required for [H 2O2]≥
140 mM and [Fe2+]≥4 mM (see Fig. 1).774 J.P . Ribeiro, C.C. Marques, I. Portugal et al. / Energy Reports 6 (2020) 770–775
Similar response surfaces were obtained for t >10 min, with maximum AOX removal reaching 95%. Catalkaya
and Kargi [17] recorded 93% AOX removal from biologically treated pulp mill wastewater using a 16 W UV lamp
and [H 2O2]=50 mM, [Fe2+]=2.5 mM, and t =5 min. In this work, for t =10 min and 150 W UV lamp,
the same [H 2O2]/[Fe2+] conditions could only remove about 50% AOX. This was probably due to the biological
treatment [17] and to inherent characteristics of each wastewater, highlighting the importance of adjusting the AOP
operational conditions to the wastewater stream being treated.
Fig. 3(b) and (c) show some benefit in using higher treatment times, especially when using higher oxidant
concentrations, allowing for 95% AOX removal to be attained (p =0.10). [Fe2+] was the less significant variable
when applying photo-Fenton process (p >0.25) (see also Fig. 4).
4. Conclusion
Both Fenton and photo-Fenton processes proved to be efficient for AOX removal from Eucalyptus globulus Kraft
ECF bleaching wastewater, depending mainly of [H 2O2] (only statistically significant variable at 95% confidence
level). For the Fenton process maximum AOX removal was 85% with [H 2O2]=177 mM, [Fe2+]=8.5 mM, pH ≈
2, 60◦C and 10 min treatment time. Photo-Fenton process reached higher efficiency combined with lower chemical
consumption. For this method, maximum AOX removal was 95% for [H 2O2]=178 mM, [Fe2+]=2.0 mM, UV
irradiance 142 W m−2, pH≈2, 60◦C and 10 min. The short treatment times of these methods are very attractive
for industrial-scale application. However, further investigation is required to assess the “side-effects” these methods
may have namely in what concerns the organic load (COD/BOD), colour, ecotoxicity, etc. of the treated wastewaters.
