Abstract
Published data on nitrate (NO/C0
3) toxicity to freshwater and marine animals are reviewed. New data on nitrate tox-
icity to the freshwater invertebrates Eulimnogammarus toletanus ,Echinogammarus echinosetosus andHydropsyche exo-
cellata are also presented. The main toxic action of nitrate is due to the conversion of oxygen-carrying pigments to
forms that are incapable of carrying oxygen. Nitrate toxicity to aquatic animals increases with increasing nitrate con-centrations and exposure times. In contrast, nitrate toxicity may decrease with increasing body size, water salinity, and
environmental adaptation. Freshwater animals appear to be more sensitive to nitrate than marine animals. A nitrate
concentration of 10 mg NO
3-N/l (USA federal maximum level for drinking water) can adversely aﬀect, at least during
long-term exposures, freshwater invertebrates ( E. toletanus ,E. echinosetosus ,Cheumatopsyche pettiti ,Hydropsyche occi-
dentalis ), ﬁshes ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ,Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ,Salmo clarki ), and amphibians ( Pseudacris triseriata ,
Rana pipiens ,Rana temporaria ,Bufo bufo ). Safe levels below this nitrate concentration are recommended to protect sen-
sitive freshwater animals from nitrate pollution. Furthermore, a maximum level of 2 mg NO 3-N/l would be appropriate
for protecting the most sensitive freshwater species. In the case of marine animals, a maximum level of 20 mg NO 3-N/l
may in general be acceptable. However, early developmental stages of some marine invertebrates, that are well adapted
to low nitrate concentrations, may be so susceptible to nitrate as sensitive freshwater invertebrates./C2112004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
In the aquatic environment, the most common ionic
(reactive) forms of inorganic nitrogen are ammonium
(NHþ
4), nitrite (NO/C0
2) and nitrate (NO/C03). These ions
may be present naturally in aquatic ecosystems as a re-sult of atmospheric deposition, surface and groundwaterrunoﬀ, dissolution of nitrogen-rich geological deposits,
N
2ﬁxation by certain prokaryotes (cyanobacteria, par-
ticularly), and biological degradation of organic matter(Spencer, 1975; Kinne, 1984; Gleick, 1993; Wetzel,
2001; Rabalais, 2002 ). Ammonium tends to be oxidized
to nitrate in a two-step process (NH
þ
4!NO/C0
2!NO/C0
3)
by aerobic chemoautotrophic bacteria ( Nitrosomonas
and Nitrobacter , primarily), even if levels of dissolved
oxygen decline to a value as low as 1.0 mg O 2/l (Sharma
and Ahlert, 1977; Stumm and Morgan, 1996; Wetzel,2001). In consequence, concentrations of nitrate in

www.elsevier.com/locate/chemospherefreshwater and marine ecosystems usually are higher
than those of ammonium and nitrite ( Spencer, 1975;
Kinne, 1984; Gleick, 1993; Wetzel, 2001; Rabalais,
2002). Nitrate (but also ammonium and nitrite) may
however be removed from water by aquatic plants, algae
and bacteria which assimilate it as a source of nitrogen
(Nixon, 1995; Smith et al., 1999; Wetzel, 2001 ). Further-
more, when concentrations of dissolved oxygen decreaseto minimum values, facultative anaerobic bacteria (e.g.,
Pseudomonas ,Micrococcus ,Bacillus ,Achromobacter )
can utilize nitrate as a terminal acceptor of electrons,resulting in the ultimate formation of N
2(Austin,
1988; Wetzel, 2001 ).
During the past two centuries, the human species has
substantially altered the global nitrogen cycle, increasing
both the availability and the mobility of nitrogen over
large regions of Earth ( Vitousek et al., 1997; Carpenter
et al., 1998; Galloway and Cowling, 2002 ). Conse-
quently, in addition to natural sources, inorganic nitro-
gen (NHþ
4,N O/C0
2,N O/C03) can nowadays enter aquatic
ecosystems via anthropogenic sources such as animalfarming, urban and agricultural runoﬀ, industrial
wastes, and sewage eﬄuents (including eﬄuents from
sewage treatment plants that are not performing tertiarytreatments) ( Meybeck et al., 1989; Conrad, 1990; Bou-
chard et al., 1992; Welch and Lindell, 1992; Gleick,
1993; Vitousek et al., 1997; Carpenter et al., 1998; Smithet al., 1999; Wetzel, 2001; Rabalais, 2002 ). Moreover,
the atmospheric deposition of inorganic nitrogen
(mainly in the form of NO
/C0
3) has dramatically increased
because of the extensive use of nitrogen fertilisers andthe huge combustion of fossil fuels ( Vitousek et al.,
1997; Carpenter et al., 1998; Moomaw, 2002; Boumans
et al., 2004 ). As a result, concentrations of nitrate in
ground and surface waters are increasing around the
world, causing one of the most prevalent environmental
problems responsible for water quality degradation on aworldwide scale ( Meybeck et al., 1989; Conrad, 1990;
Bouchard et al., 1992; Welch and Lindell, 1992; Gleick,
1993; Nixon, 1995; Smith et al., 1999; Wetzel, 2001;Rabalais, 2002; Smith, 2003 ). Nitrate concentrations
may actually exceed values as high as 25 mg NO
3-N/l
in surface waters and 100 mg NO 3-N/l in ground waters
(Bogardi et al., 1991; Goodrich et al., 1991; Gleick,
1993; Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,
1993; Steinheimer et al., 1998 ). On the other hand, in
marine aquaria and aquaculture systems, where wateris recirculating with good oxygenation, nitrate concen-
trations can approach values of 500 mg NO
3-N/l ( De
Graaf, 1964; Pierce et al., 1993 ).
In spite of the current worldwide environmental con-
cern about increasing nitrate concentrations in ground
and surface waters, comparatively few studies have beenconducted to assess nitrate toxicity to aquatic animals,probably because it has been traditionally assumed that
other occurring inorganic nitrogen compounds, such asammonia (the unionized form of NH
þ
4) and nitrite, are
more toxic ( Russo, 1985; Meade and Watts, 1995; Wet-
zel, 2001; Alonso and Camargo, 2003 ). In fact, although
safe levels of ammonia have been well established forﬁshes and aquatic invertebrates ( Alabaster and Lloyd,
1982; US Environmental Protection Agency, 1986 ), no
safe level of nitrate has been established for aquatic ani-mals ( US Environmental Protection Agency, 1986; Scott
and Crunkilton, 2000 ). It however is worth mentioning
that an acceptable level of nitrate for seawater culture
was considered to be less than 20 mg NO
3-N/l ( Spotte,
1979).
The main toxic action of nitrate on aquatic animals is
due to the conversion of oxygen-carrying pigments (e.g.,hemoglobin, hemocyanin) to forms that are incapable of
carrying oxygen (e.g., methemoglobin) ( Grabda et al.,
1974; Conrad, 1990; Jensen, 1996; Scott and Crunkilton,2000; Cheng and Chen, 2002 ). Nevertheless, owing to
the low branchial permeability to nitrate, the NO
/C0
3up-
take in aquatic animals seems to be more limited than
the uptake of NHþ
4and NO/C0
2, contributing to the rela-
tively low toxicity of nitrate ( Russo, 1985; Meade and
Watts, 1995; Jensen, 1996; Stormer et al., 1996; Cheng
and Chen, 2002; Alonso and Camargo, 2003 ).
Elevated nitrate concentrations in drinking waters
have serious risks for humans. Ingested nitrates may
cause methemoglobinemia in infants through their con-version to nitrites (under anaerobic conditions in the
gut) and the subsequent blockade of the oxygen-carrying
capacity of hemoglobin ( Sandstedt, 1990; Amdur et al.,
1991; Wolfe and Patz, 2002 ). In addition, ingested ni-
trates have a potential role in developing cancers of
the digestive tract through their contribution to the for-
mation of nitrosamines, which are among the most po-tent of the known carcinogens in mammals ( Harte
et al., 1991; Nash, 1993 ). To prevent these deleterious
eﬀects of nitrate on human health, drinking water qual-ity criteria have been established: the USA federal max-
imum contaminant level is 10 mg NO
3-N/l ( US
Environmental Protection Agency, 1986; Nash, 1993;Scott and Crunkilton, 2000 ).
The chief purpose of this paper is to review published
scientiﬁc literature on the toxic eﬀects of nitrate (NO
/C0
3)o n
freshwater and marine animals (invertebrates, ﬁshes andamphibians) to establish preliminary safe levels of nitrate
for aquatic life. To better compare toxicity data from dif-
ferent authors, all concentrations and levels of nitratewere expressed as mg NO
3-N/l. Additionally, we present
new data on the short-term toxicity of nitrate to three
species of freshwater invertebrates that are relatively com-mon in rivers and streams of Central Spain: Eulimno-
gammarus toletanus Pinkster & Stock (Gammaridae,
Amphipoda, Crustacea), Echinogammarus echinosetosus
Pinkster (Gammaridae, Amphipoda, Crustacea), andHydropsyche exocellata Dufo¨ur (Hydropsychidae, Tri-
choptera, Insecta). Individuals of E. toletanus and1256 J.A. Camargo et al. / Chemosphere 58 (2005) 1255–1267E. echinosetosus are shredder and detritivorous animals
that feed on coarse particulate organic matter. Caddisﬂy
larvae of H. exocellata are ﬁlter-feeders that construct
ﬁxed silk retreat-nets to strain food particles from the cur-rent. These species were chosen because the information
on nitrate toxicity to freshwater invertebrates, particu-
larly to freshwater amphipods, was very limited.
2. Materials and methods
Adults of Eulimnogammarus toletanus (average size
of 8.5 mm in length) and Echinogammarus echinosetosus
(average size of 11.2 mm in length), and last instar larvaeofHydropsyche exocellata (>1 mm head capsule width),
were obtained from relatively unpolluted reaches of the
Henares River (Central Spain). Invertebrates were trans-ported to the laboratory using plastic containers withriver water. No animal died during transportation. In
the laboratory, invertebrates were deposited into three
glass aquaria (one for each species) and acclimated towater quality conditions for seven days prior to the
beginning of toxicity bioassays. During acclimation,
amphipods were fed with macerated poplar leaves fromthe Henares river, and caddisﬂy larvae were fed with ﬁne
particulate dried ﬁsh food.
Invertebrate species were tested separately. Three sta-
tic (with water renovation) short-term toxicity bioassays
were conducted in triplicate for ﬁve days using small
glass aquaria, each containing one litre of bottled drink-ing water (with no chlorine). A control and 5-6 diﬀerentnominal nitrate concentrations were used per bioassay,
with 10 animals per concentration/aquarium (including
control). Test nitrate concentrations ranged from 5 to160 mg NO
3-N/l for E. echinosetosus , from 15 to 480
mg NO 3-N/l for E. toletanus , and from 20 to 640 mg
NO 3-N/l for H. exocellata . In all cases, nitrate solutions
were made from sodium nitrate (NaNO 3, Merck, Ger-
many). These nitrate solutions, together with water in
control aquaria, were daily renewed. Invertebrates werenot fed during bioassays to prevent changes in nitrateconcentrations. Water oxygenation and turbulence were
produced with air pumps and airstones. Average water
quality conditions during bioassays were: 7.7 mg O
2/l
for dissolved oxygen, 17.9 /C176C for temperature, 7.8 for
pH, and 293 mg CaCO 3/l for total hardness. In the case
ofH. exocellata, and following previous recommenda-
tions by Camargo and Ward (1992) , PVC pieces were
added to quaria to facilitate net-building by net-spinning
caddisﬂy larvae. Mortality was recorded every day, deadanimals being removed.
Statistical analyses were performed using the multi-
factor probit analysis (MPA) software ( US Environmen-
tal Protection Agency, 1991; Lee et al., 1995 ). The MPA
methodology solves the concentration-time-response
equation simultaneously via the iterative reweighed leastsquares technique (multiple linear regression). The
dependent variable is the probit of the proportion
responding to each concentration, and the independent
variables are exposure time and toxicant concentration.After evaluating several MPA models regarding the het-
erogeneity factor (chi-squared variable divided by de-
grees of freedom), a parallel-regression-line model wasselected as the best one. 48, 72, 96 and 120 h LC
10and
LC50values were calculated for each test species. In
addition, 120 h LC 0.01values (lethal concentrations for
0.01% response after 120 h of exposure) were estimatedfor each test species as short-term safe levels of nitrate.
3. Toxicity to aquatic invertebrates
Nitrate toxicity to aquatic invertebrates increases
with increasing nitrate concentrations and exposuretimes ( Camargo and Ward, 1992, 1995; Scott and
Crunkilton, 2000; Tsai and Chen, 2002; Alonso and
Camargo, 2003 ). Conversely, nitrate toxicity decreases
with increasing body size and water salinity ( Camargo
and Ward, 1992, 1995; Tsai and Chen, 2002 ). In general,
freshwater invertebrates appear to be more sensitive tonitrate toxicity than marine invertebrates as a probable
consequence of the ameliorating eﬀect of water salinity
on the tolerance of aquatic invertebrates to nitrate ions.However, early life stages of some marine invertebrates
may be very sensitive to nitrate toxicity ( Muir et al.,
1991).
Camargo and Ward (1992) , studying the short-term
toxicity of NaNO
3to the Nearctic net-spinning caddis-
ﬂies Cheumatopsyche pettiti and Hydropsyche occiden-
talis, calculated 72, 96 and 120 h LC 50values of
nitrate-nitrogen for early and last instar larvae of these
two hydropsychid species ( Table 1 ). In both cases, early
instar larvae appeared to be more sensitive to nitratetoxicity than last instar larvae. Additionally, Camargo
and Ward (1995) estimated short-term safe levels (120
hL C
0.01values) of 6.7 and 9.6 mg NO 3-N/l for early
and last instar larvae of C. pettiti , and 4.5 and 6.5 mg
NO 3-N/l for early and last instar larvae of H. occiden-
talis(Table 1 ).
Meade and Watts (1995) examined the toxic eﬀects of
NaNO 3on the survival and metabolic rate (oxygen con-
sumption) in juvenile individuals (9–13 mm total length)
of the Australian freshwater crayﬁsh Cherax quadrica-
rinatus . After 5 days, no mortality was observed in cray-
ﬁsh exposed to a nominal nitrate concentration of 1000
mg NO 3-N/l. Furthermore, no signiﬁcant diﬀerence was
observed in oxygen consumption between control (0 mg
NO 3-N/l) and experimental (1000 mg NO 3-N/l) individ-
uals ( Table 1 ).
Jensen (1996) studied the uptake and physiological
eﬀects of nitrate ions (from NaNO 3) in the freshwater
crayﬁsh Astacus astacus . The nitrate uptake was minorJ.A. Camargo et al. / Chemosphere 58 (2005) 1255–1267 1257Table 1

NO 3-N/l for seven days, indicating a low branchial per-
meability to nitrate ( Table 1 ). This minor uptake of ni-
trate appeared to be passive, the haemolymph nitrate
concentration staying far below the ambient nitrate con-
centration. In addition, nitrate exposure did not inducesigniﬁcant changes in haemolymph chloride, sodium or
potassium concentrations, nor in divalent cations and
anions, extracellular osmolality and amino acid concen-trations ( Table 1 ).
Scott and Crunkilton (2000) , examining the acute
toxicity of NaNO
3to neonates of the cladocerans Cerio-
daphnia dubia (<24 h old) and Daphnia magna (<48 h
old), estimated 48 h LC 50values of 374 and 462 mg
NO 3-N/l ( Table 1 ). Moreover, Scott and Crunkilton
(2000) reported that the no-observed-eﬀect concentra-
tion (NOEC) and the lowest-observed-eﬀect concentra-
tion (LOEC), for neonate production in C. dubia
females after 7 days of exposure to nominal nitrate con-centrations ranging from 2.2 to 113 mg NO
3-N/l, ranged
from 7.1 to 56.5 mg NO 3-N/l (average NOEC value of
21.3 mg NO 3-N/l) and from 14.1 to 113 mg NO 3-N/l
(average LOEC value of 42.6 mg NO 3-N/l) ( Table 1 ).
Alonso and Camargo (2003) , conducting laboratory
experiments to examine the acute toxicity of NaNO 3
to the snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum , calculated 24,
48, 72 and 96 h LC 10and LC 50values ( Table 1 ). This
aquatic snail appeared to be relatively tolerant to nitrate
toxicity, since an exposure of 4 days to a nitrate concen-tration as high as 585 mg NO 3-N/l (96 h LC 10value)
could potentially cause 10% mortality in P. antipodarum .
Alonso and Camargo (2003) also estimated a short-
term safe level (96 h LC 0.01value) of 195 mg NO 3-N/l
(Table 1 ).
In toxicity tests with Eulimnogammarus toletanus ,
Echinogammarus echinosetosus andHydropsyche exocel-
lata, mortality percentages increased with increasing ni-
trate concentrations and exposure times. Before death,gammarids showed alterations in normal movement,
and net-spinning caddisﬂy larvae tended to migrate from
their retreat and capture nets. This sublethal eﬀect ofmigration in larvae of H. exocellata has been previously
reported in larvae of other hydropsychid species exposed
to high levels of sodium nitrate ( Camargo and Ward,
1992, 1995 ). The 48, 72, 96 and 120 h LC
10and LC 50
values, and their 95% conﬁdence limits, are presented
inTable 2 . From a simple comparison of LC 50values
(Tables 1 and 2 ), we can see that test gammarid species
(in particular E. echinosetosus ) seem to be more sensitive
to nitrate toxicity than other freshwater invertebrates, at
least during short-term exposures. Furthermore, a ni-trate concentration as low as 8.5 mg NO
3-N/l (120 h
LC10value) could potentially cause 10% mortality in
E. echinosetosus . Short-term safe levels (120 h LC 0.01val-
ues) of nitrate for E. toletanus ,E. echinosetosus andH.
exocellata are also presented in Table 2 . 120 h LC 0.01
values for gammarid species were lower than those
for hydropsychid species ( Tables 1 and 2 ). The lowestTable 1 ( continued )

N/l).
Regarding marine invertebrates, Epifano and Srna
(1975) , studying the acute toxicity of NaNO 3to juveniles
of the American oyster Crassostrea virginica , estimated a
96 h LC 50value of 3794 mg NO 3-N/l ( Table 1 ).Wickins
(1976) , examining the acute toxicity of NaNO 3to com-
bined species of penaeid shrimps ( Penaeus aztecus ,P.
japonicus ,P. occidentalis ,P. orientalis ,P. schmitti and
P. setiferus ), estimated a 48 h LC 50value as high as
3400 mg NO 3-N/l in 28 &seawater ( Table 1 ).Basuyaux
and Mathieu (1999) , studying the eﬀect of elevated ni-
trate concentrations on growth of the abalone Haliotis
tuberculata and the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus dur-
ing 15 days of exposure, reported maximum safe levels
of 100 mg NO 3-N/l for P. lividus and 250 mg NO 3-N/l
forH. tuberculata (Table 1 ).
Cheng and Chen (2002) found that a nitrate con-
centration of 105 mg NO 3-N/l caused reduction of oxy-
hemocyanin and protein in individuals (wet weight of
8.28–14.85 g) of the Kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japo-
nicus (Table 1 ). Similarly, Cheng et al. (2002) studied
nitrate accumulation (from NaNO 3) in tissues of the pen-
aeid shrimp Penaeus monodon , and found that nitrate
accumulated in muscle, hepatopancreas, foregut, heart,
gill, hemolymph, midgut and eyestalk by factors of 0.16,
0.20, 0.26, 0.45, 0.60, 0.61, 0.83 and 1.32 over the ambi-ent nitrate concentration. In addition, Tsai and Chen
(2002) , examining the acute toxicity of NaNO
3on juve-
niles (average length 28.4 mm) of P. monodon at diﬀerent
salinity levels, reported that 48, 72 and 96 h LC 50values
were: 2876, 1723 and 1449 mg NO 3-N/l in 15 &seawater
(Table 1 ); 3894, 2506 and 1575 mg NO 3-N/l in 25 &sea-
water ( Table 1 ); and 4970, 3525 and 2316 mg NO 3-N/l
in 35&seawater ( Table 1 ). Safe levels for rearing P.
monodon juveniles were estimated to be 145, 158 and
232 mg NO 3-N/l at salinity levels of 15 &,2 5&and
35&(Table 1 ).
In contrast, Muir et al. (1991) reported much lower
levels of nitrate toxicity in P. monodon . They studied
the tolerance of larvae at the Protozoea I stage (55–60h after hatching) to NaNO
3, and found that signiﬁcant
mortality (31–37%) occurred within 40 h at a nitrate
concentration as low as 0.226 mg NO 3-N/l ( Table 1 ).
Examination of surviving larvae from nitrate treatments
indicated sublethal histopatological changes including
vacuolation and shrinkage of the ganglionic neuropiles,and minor muscle fragmentation and shrinkage. At
higher nitrate concentrations (2.26 and 22.6 mg NO
3-
N/l), larval mortality increased (35–43% and 37–58%;Table 1 ) and additional tissues were aﬀected: vacuola-
tion and splitting of the hypodermis from the cuticle,
and cytoplasmatic vacuolation of cells in the midgutand proventriculus. Because P. monodon larvae moulted
from Protozoea I to Protozoea II stage during the exper-
imental study, and because P. monodon larvae occur nat-urally in oﬀshore, tropical regions which typically
contain extremely low levels of dissolved nitrate (<0.05
mg NO
3-N/l; see Spencer, 1975; Kinne, 1984; Motoh,
1985),Muir et al. (1991) concluded that the relatively
great sensitivity of P. monodon larvae to nitrate toxicity
might be related to ontogeny and natural habitat: on the
one hand, it is likely that larvae are more susceptible tonitrate during ecdysis; on the other hand, it is possiblethat larvae are well adapted to natural conditions (very
low nitrate concentrations) and, consequently, are intol-
erant of elevated nitrate concentrations.
4. Toxicity to ﬁshes
Nitrate toxicity to freshwater and marine ﬁshes in-
creases with increasing nitrate concentrations and expo-sure times ( Trama, 1954; Westin, 1974; Colt and
Tchobanoglous, 1976; Rubin and Elmaraghy, 1977;
Kincheloe et al., 1979; Brownell, 1980; Tomasso and
Carmichael, 1986; Pierce et al., 1993; Scott and Crunkil-ton, 2000 ). Furthermore, nitrate toxicity can depend
greatly upon the cationic composition of the solution
(Dowden and Bennett, 1965 ). As in the case of aquatic
invertebrates, freshwater ﬁshes appear to be more sensi-
tive to nitrate toxicity than marine ﬁshes.
Trama (1954) found that the common bluegill Lep-
omis macrochirus was able to tolerate elevated nitrate
levels during short-term exposures: a 96 h LC
50value
of 1975 mg NO 3-N/l was estimated for this ﬁsh species
(Table 3 ).Dowden and Bennett (1965) reported that
the 24 h LC 50values of NaNO 3and KNO 3forL. mac-
rochirus were 2110 and 761 mg NO 3-N/l ( Table 3 ).
Knepp and Arkin (1973) reported that the channel
catﬁsh Ictalurus punctatus was able to tolerate a nitrate
concentration of 90 mg NO 3-N/l without aﬀecting their
growth and feeding activity after an exposure of 164days ( Table 3 ).Colt and Tchobanoglous (1976) , evaluat-
ing the short-term toxicity of NaNO
3to ﬁngerlings (50–
76 mm total length) of I. punctatus at 22, 26 and 30 /C176C,
calculated 96 h LC 50values of 1355, 1423 and 1400 mg
NO 3-N/l ( Table 3 ). They concluded that the acute toxic-
ity of nitrate to I. punctatus was independent of water
temperature.
Westin (1974) reported that the 96 h LC 50values of
nitrate for the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (Sal-
mo gairdneri , previously) and the chinook salmon
Oncorhynchus tshawytscha were 1355 and 1310 mg
NO 3-N/l ( Table 3 ).Stormer et al. (1996) exposed ﬁnger-
lings of O. mykiss to a nitrate concentration of 14 mg
NO 3-N/l for 8 days. They found that NO/C0
3ions were
taken up passively, with plasma concentrations remain-
ing below the ambient nitrate concentration. This lim-ited uptake appeared central to the low toxicity ofnitrate, and did not measurably inﬂuence electrolyte bal-
ance or haematology ( Table 3 ).1260 J.A. Camargo et al. / Chemosphere 58 (2005) 1255–1267Table 3

Values of toxicological parameters (LC 50, NOAEL, NOEC, LOEC) at diﬀerent exposure times for several species of freshwater and
marine ﬁshes.
aAnimals were exposed to sodium nitrate (NaNO 3).
bAnimals were exposed to potassium nitrate (KNO 3).J.A. Camargo et al. / Chemosphere 58 (2005) 1255–1267 1261The ﬁrst indication that relatively low concentrations
of nitrate might be harmful to ﬁsh came from Grabda
et al. (1974) . They reported that fry of rainbow trout, ex-
posed to 5–6 mg NO 3-N/l for several days, displayed in-
creased blood levels of ferrihemoglobin, alterations in
the peripheral blood and hematopoietic centres, and
liver damage. In addition, Kincheloe et al. (1979) , exam-
ining the tolerance of several salmonid species to nitratetoxicity after an exposure of 30 days, reported that devel-
oping eggs and early fry stages of O. mykiss ,O. tshawyts-
chaand the (Lahontan) cutthroat trout Salmo clarki
exhibited signiﬁcant increases in mortality at nitrate con-
centrations from 1.1 to 4.5 mg NO
3-N/l ( Table 3 ). In the
case of the coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch , eggs and
fry were not aﬀected at the highest nitrate concentration
of 4.5 mg NO 3-N/l ( Table 3 ).Kincheloe et al. (1979)
concluded that a nitrate level as low as 2.0 mg NO 3-
N/l in surface waters of low total hardness (<40 mgCaCO
3/l) would be expected to limit survival of some
salmonid ﬁsh populations because of impaired repro-
ductive success.
Rubin and Elmaraghy (1977) , after examining the
acute toxicity of KNO 3to guppy ( Poecilia reticulatus )
fry, calculated 24, 48, 72 and 96 h LC 50values of 267,
219, 199 and 191 mg NO 3-N/l ( Table 3 ).Tomasso and
Carmichael (1986) reported that the 96 h LC 50value
of nitrate for the Guadalupe bass Micropterus treculi
was 1261 mg NO 3-N/l ( Table 3 ).Tilak et al. (2002) ,
using static and continuous ﬂow through systems, deter-
mined 24 h LC 50values of 1565 and 1484 mg NO 3-N/l
for the Indian major carp Catla catla (Table 3 ).
Scott and Crunkilton (2000) , after conducting labo-
ratory experiments to examine the acute toxicity of
NaNO 3to larvae (<8 day old) of the fathead minnow
Pimephales promelas , found that the 96 h LC 50value
fell within the range of 1010–1607 mg NO 3-N/l (aver-
age LC 50value of 1341 mg NO 3-N/l; Table 3 ).Scott
and Crunkilton (2000) also reported that the no-
observed-eﬀect concentration (NOEC) and the lowest-
observed-eﬀect concentration (LOEC), for the growthof newly hatched larvae (<24 h old) of P. promelas
after an exposure of 7 days, were 358 and 717 mg
NO
3-N/l ( Table 3 ). These larvae were lethargic and
exhibited bent spines before death at a nitrate concen-tration of 717 mg NO
3-N/l.
With regard to marine ﬁshes, Brownell (1980) re-
ported 24 h LC 50values (mg NO 3-N/l) in 34 &seawater
of 3450 for Lithognathus mormyrus , 3560 for Diplodus
saegus , and 5050 for Heteromycteris capensis (Table 3 ).
Pierce et al. (1993) estimated 96 h LC 50values (mg
NO 3-N/l) in 32 &seawater of 573 for the planehead ﬁle-
ﬁshMonocanthus hispidus , >960 for the clearnose skate
Raja eglanteria , 1000 for the Florida pompano Trachino-
tus carolinus , 2400 for the black sea bass Centropristis
striata , and >3000 for the beaugregory Pomacentrus
leucostritus (Table 3 ).5. Toxicity to amphibians
Current ﬁeld data suggest that nitrogen fertilizers,
such as ammonium nitrate (NH 4NO 3), potassium ni-
trate (KNO 3) and sodium nitrate (NaNO 3), may be con-
tributing (with pesticides) to the decline of amphibian
populations in agricultural areas ( Wederkinch, 1988;
Berger, 1989; Hecnar, 1995; Oldham et al., 1997; Birgeet al., 2000 ). Laboratory studies have shown that the
toxicity of nitrate compounds to amphibians increases
with increasing nitrate concentrations and exposuretimes ( Baker and Waights, 1993, 1994; Hecnar, 1995;
Xu and Oldham, 1997; Marco et al., 1999; Schuytema
and Nebeker, 1999a,b,c ). The tolerance of amphibians
to nitrogen fertilizers may however increase with
increasing body size ( Schuytema and Nebeker,
1999a,b ) and environmental adaptation ( Johansson
et al., 2001 ).
Baker and Waights (1993) , studying the toxicity of
NaNO
3to tadpoles of the common toad Bufo bufo ,
found that these animals exhibited reduced feedingactivity, weight loss and decreased survival (84.6% mor-
tality) when exposed for 13 days to a nitrate concentra-
tion of 9.1 mg NO
3-N/l ( Table 4 ). Similarly, Baker and
Waights (1994) , examining the toxicity of NaNO 3to
tadpoles of the treefrog Litoria caerulea , found that
these animals exhibited reduced feeding activity, weightloss and decreased survival (58.0% mortality) when ex-
posed for 16 days to a nitrate concentration of 22.7
mg NO
3-N/l ( Table 4 ).
Hecnar (1995) , examining the acute toxicity of
NH 4NO 3to tadpoles of the American toad Bufo americ-
anus, the chorus frog Pseudacris triseriata , the leopard
frog Rana pipiens and the green frog Rana clamitans , re-
ported 96 h LC 50values within the range 13.6–39.3 mg
NO 3-N/l ( Table 4 ).Hecnar (1995) also examined the
chronic (100 days) toxicity of NH 4NO 3to these amphib-
ian species, and found that tadpoles of chorus frog and
leopard frog exhibited lower survivorship at a nitrate
concentration of 10.0 mg NO 3-N/l ( Table 4 ). Signs of
anormal behavior and development were similar in acuteand chronic experiments: tadpoles swam and fed less
vigorously, exhibited swelled and transparent bodies,
developed head and digestive-system deformities, andsuﬀered edemas and paralysis before death. Although
Hecnar (1995) only considered nitrate toxicity when
using ammonium nitrate, the toxicity of H
4NO 3could
be due not only to nitrate but also to ammonia (the un-
ionized form of NHþ
4). Because laboratory conditions
during toxicity tests were 7.6 for pH and 20 /C176C for tem-
perature ( Hecnar, 1995 ), it may be estimated that maxi-
mum ammonia levels in acute and chronic exposures
were 1.0 and 0.20 mg NH 3/l, respectively. These NH 3
levels are higher than the established safe levels ofammonia for aquatic animals ( Alabaster and Lloyd,
1982; US Environmental Protection Agency, 1986 )1262 J.A. Camargo et al. / Chemosphere 58 (2005) 1255–1267and, consequently, we can assume that, in addition to ni-
trate toxicity, some toxicity might have been caused byNH
3.
Xu and Oldham (1997) examined lethal and sublethal
eﬀects of NH 4NO 3on tadpoles of the common toad
Bufo bufo . They reported 96 and 168 h LC 50values of
384.8 and 369.6 mg NO 3-N/l ( Table 4 ). Tadpoles exhib-ited certain unusual behavior (either undirected swim-
ming movements or twisting laterally), remaining staticunless disturbed. In a subchronic exposure (30 days) ata nitrate concentration of 22.6 mg NO
3-N/l, there was
21% mortality and a further 17% failed to resorb their
tails at metamorphosis ( Table 4 ). As in the case of Hec-
nar (1995), Xu and Oldham (1997) only consideredTable 4

Values of toxicological parameters (LC 50, NOAEL, NOEC, LOEC) at diﬀerent exposure times for several species of amphibians.
aAnimals were exposed to sodium nitrate (NaNO 3).
bAnimals were exposed to potassium nitrate (KNO 3).
cAnimals were exposed to ammonium nitrate (NH 4NO 3).J.A. Camargo et al. / Chemosphere 58 (2005) 1255–1267 1263nitrate toxicity when using ammonium nitrate. Because
laboratory conditions during toxicity tests were 7.4 for
pH and 27.5 /C176C for temperature ( Xu and Oldham,
1997), it may be estimated that maximum ammonia lev-
els in acute and subchronic exposures were 9.2 and 0.51
mg NH 3/l, respectively. In consequence, we can assume
that, in addition to nitrate toxicity, some toxicity mighthave been caused by NH
3.
Laposata and Dunson (1998) exposed fertilized
eggs of the wood frog Rana sylvatica , the American
toad Bufo americanus , the Jeﬀerson salamander Ambys-
toma jeﬀersonianum and the spotted salamander A. mac-
ulatum to a nitrate concentration of 9.0 mg NO 3-N/l
(from NaNO 3). They found that there was no signiﬁ-
cant diﬀerence in the hatching success with regard
to control eggs in any of the four amphibian species
(Table 4 ).
Marco et al. (1999) , studying the eﬀects of KNO 3on
several amphibian species indigenous of the Paciﬁc
Northwest (USA), found that newly hatched larvae of
Rana pretiosa and Ambystoma gracile , exposed for 15
days to nitrate concentrations within the range 0.78–
25.0 mg NO 3-N/l, reduced feeding activity, swam less
vigorously, suﬀered edemas and paralysis, and eventu-ally died. They calculated 15 d LC
50values of 16.45
mg NO 3-N/l for R. pretiosa and 23.39 mg NO 3-N/l for
A. gracile (Table 4 ).
Schuytema and Nebeker (1999a,b,c) examined the
toxic eﬀects of NaNO 3on embryos and tadpoles of the
Paciﬁc treefrog Pseudacris regilla , the African clawed
frog Xenopus laevis and the red-legged frog Rana aurora .
Schuytema and Nebeker (1999a) calculated 96 and 240 h
LC50values (mg NO 3-N/l) of 643 and 578 for embryos of
P. regilla , and a 120 h LC 50value of 438.4 mg NO 3-N/l
for embryos of X. laevis (Table 4 ). NOAEL (no observed
adverse eﬀect level) values, based on reduced growth
(wet weight) of embryos, were 56.7 mg NO 3-N/l for
P. regilla and 24.8 mg NO 3-N/l for X. laevis (Table 4 ).
Schuytema and Nebeker (1999b) calculated 96 and 240
hL C 50values (mg NO 3-N/l) of 1749.8 and 266.2 for tad-
poles of P. regilla , and 1655.8 and 1236.2 for tadpoles of
X. laevis (Table 4 ). NOAEL values, based on reduced
growth (wet weight) of tadpoles, were 30.1 mg NO 3-N/
l for P. regilla and 65.6 mg NO 3-N/l for X. laevis (Table
4). Lastly, Schuytema and Nebeker (1999c) reported, for
embryos of R. aurora , a 16 d LC 50value of 636.3 mg
NO 3-N/l and a NOAEL value (based on length) of 29
mg NO 3-N/l ( Table 4 ).
Allran and Karasov (2000) , studying NaNO 3toxicity
to larvae of the leopard frog Rana pipiens exposed from
ﬁrst-feeding stage through metamorphosis, found that a
nominal nitrate concentration of 30 mg NO 3-N/l had no
signiﬁcant eﬀect on development rate, percent metamor-phosis, time to metamorphosis, percent survival, mass atmetamorphosis, or hematocrit. Although the growth of
larvae was slowed, this growth inhibition was not bio-logically important when compared with natural varia-
tion in the environment.
Johansson et al. (2001) , after conducting a compari-
son of nitrate tolerance between diﬀerent populationsof the common frog Rana temporaria , reported that a ni-
trate concentration of 5.0 mg NO
3-N/l might reduce the
growth rate and metamorphic size in larvae (stage 25)from the northern parts of Scandinavia (less well adaptedto cope with high environmental nitrate levels), but not in
larvae from the southern parts of Scandinavia (better
adapted to cope with high environmental nitrate levels)(Table 4 ). They concluded that increased anthropogenic
nitrate pollution could impact more the northern than
the southern Swedish common frog populations.
Sullivan and Spence (2003) , examining NaNO
3toxic-
ity to tadpoles of the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis ,
found that a nominal nitrate concentration of 66 mgNO
3-N/l had no signiﬁcant eﬀect on the survival and
metamorphosis of these animals during a exposure of
40 days ( Table 4 ).
6. Concluding remarks
It should be evident, from data presented in this re-
view, that nitrate discharges from anthropogenic sources
may result in a serious ecological risk for certain aquaticanimals. Indeed, as a consequence of nitrogen pollution,
nitrate concentrations in surface waters can actually ex-
ceed values of 25 mg NO
3-N/l ( Bogardi et al., 1991; Gle-
ick, 1993; Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,1993). Because a nitrate concentration of 10 mg NO
3-
N/l (USA federal maximum level for drinking water)
can adversely aﬀect, at least during long-term exposures,freshwater invertebrates ( Eulimnogammarus toletanus ,
Echinogammarus echinosetosus ,Cheumatopsyche pettiti ,
Hydropsyche occidentalis ), ﬁshes ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ,
Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ,Salmo clarki ), and amphibi-
ans ( Pseudacris triseriata ,Rana pipiens ,Rana tempo-
raria,Bufo bufo )(Tables 1–4 ), safe levels below this
nitrate concentration are therefore recommended to pro-tect these sensitive freshwater animals from nitrate pol-
lution. Furthermore, following Kincheloe et al. /C213s
(1979) recommendation, we consider that a maximum
level of 2.0 mg NO
3-N/l would be appropriate for pro-
tecting the most sensitive freshwater species. In the case
of marine invertebrates and ﬁshes, we consider that theproposed maximum level of 20 mg NO
3-N/l for cultur-
ing seawater animals ( Spotte, 1979 ) may in general be
acceptable. However, early developmental stages ofsome marine invertebrates ( Muir et al., 1991 ), that are
well adapted to low nitrate concentrations, may be so
susceptible to nitrate as sensitive freshwater inverte-brates ( Tables 1 and 2 ).
In spite of this proposal of preliminary safe levels of
nitrate for aquatic animals, further studies, especially1264 J.A. Camargo et al. / Chemosphere 58 (2005) 1255–1267long-term studies, are required to check and improve the
recommended safe levels. Additional studies must also
examine the inﬂuence of water hardness, salinity, pH,
temperature, dissolved oxygen and other chemical com-pounds on nitrate toxicity to aquatic animals. Lastly,
because aquatic organisms are subjected to biotic inter-
actions (e.g., competition, predation, parasitism) anddiseases, ﬁeld and laboratory studies should be carriedout to assess the eﬀects of elevated nitrate concentra-
tions on these ecological and evolutionary agents of nat-
ural selection.
