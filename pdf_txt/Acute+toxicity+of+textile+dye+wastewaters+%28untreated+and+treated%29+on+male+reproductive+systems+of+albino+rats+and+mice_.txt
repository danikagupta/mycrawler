ABSTRACT : Environmental pollution by textile dye waste water is an alarming issue in Bangladesh. This water is very toxic as it contains 
dyes, alkalis, heavy metals etc. in high concentration. However, no comprehensive study has yet been undertaken in Bangladesh knowing 
the effects of textile dye waste water in living animal. This study investigated the effects on the reproductive system of swiss albino mice 
exposed to waste water collected from a textile dye industry. For this purpose, 24 sexually matured mice were divided into three equal groups- control, influent (untreated water) and effluent (biologically treated water) group. Each group contains six female and two male. 
The mice were exposed to waste water for 30 days through oral route and were kept in the cages in the ratio of 3:1(female : male). Gross 
study revealed that, no abnormality found in ovary and testis but there was significant (p<0.05) weight reduction in testes while no reduction in weight of ovary. Histologically, lymphocytic infiltration and displacement of seminiferous tubule from basement membrane were 
found. The magnitude of these alterations was stronger in the influent group compared to effluent group. In case of progeny, from control and effluent group, dams gave birth 4- 5 liters whereas no liter from influent group. From this study, it is observed that significant 
histopathological changes were found in the testes of influent group which may be one of the causes of infertility of that group. In the 
progeny of effluent group, no abnormalities were observed. So, from these findings it is concluded that, water from textile dye industry  
specially influent has a toxic effect on reproductive system particularly on male mice.

1. INTRODUCTION 
NDUSTRIALIZATION is believed to cause inev itable 
problems, such as pollution of air, water and soil. The 
textile industry is one such source that  grew out of the 
industrial revolution in the 18th century as mass production 
of clothing became a mainstream industry. Workers of  textile 
industry are mainly  exposed to a variety of toxic dyes, 
bleaching agents, salts, acids,  alkalis and heavy metals like 
cadmium, copper, zinc, chromium, iron etc and possibly 
carcinogenic compounds such as dyes, organic solvents and fixatives throughout  the printing process [1]. Textile mill 
operations consist of weaving, dyeing, printing and finishing  
[2]. Many processes involve  several steps, each contributing a 
particular type of waste, which may invite many diseases: both  occupational and general [2] and consequently escalating 
the economic cost  [3]. The voluminous amount, toxic nature 
and restricted land area for disposal makes environment management of chemical sludge generated from Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) for textile dyeing and printing process waste  wate r a major challenge  [3]. Most of 
the time, waste water from textile dye industry of which <10% is treated (effluent); the remainder is discharged untreated (influent) in drains and shallow pools adjoining printing 
industries, causing  a serious pollution pr oblem [4]. A wide 
range of animals including cattle drink the contaminated water, either because of the lack of access to safe water or 
because of the high salt content of the waste water (2.45±0.9 
g/L ). Accidental drinking of pool waste water resulted in calf mortality [5]. 
However, potentially hazardous agents and situations are 
encountered in this industry, some of which might even 
influence the reproductive health [6]. Humans may also be  
affected from exposure to agents that interfere with ovulation 
or spermatogenesis [7].  The toxicity of azo dyes based on 
benzidine and its congeners, dimethyl and dimethoxybenzidine, has been extensively studied in so far as I

http://www.ijser.org  textile, leather and paper industries use a large number of 
dyes derived from these chemicals. Benzidine csuses cancer of 
the bladder in humans [8]. I n mammals, the azo dyes are 
metabolized to their parent amines by intestinal microflora. These amine derivatives unlike their parent compounds, are 
readily absorbed by the gut [9], [10], [11]. Their urinary 
detection has been reported in several exposed species, 
including humans [12], monkeys [13], rodents and dogs [14]. The amine derivatives may cause mutagenic effects [15],[16] 
which may lead to cancer, as observed in animals repeatedly 
exposed to aniline through diet [17].  
There is an incomplete knowledge regarding the potential 
reproductive toxicity of textile dye waste  water in mammals.  
Therefore, in the present study, an attempt has been made to 
study the effects of textile dye waste water on reprod uctive 
system of Swiss albino mice and their progeny.  
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
2.1 Animals:  Healthy, mature Swiss albino mice ( Mus musculus ) 
(age: 50- 55 days), weighing 30- 35g were acclimated 1 week 
prior to entry into the experimental protocol. Animals we re 
housed in a well ventilated facility (temperature = 25±3 °C; humidity = 40-60%; 12 h light:  dark cycle) maintaining  the  
guidelines of institutional ethical committee  and fed a 
standard diet provided by International Centre of Diarrheal 
Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) and tap water ad 
libitum. Thereafter, animals were divided into three groups supplied different water treatments orally for 30 days, 
including: control group (university tap water), influent group (untreated textile dye waste  water) and effluent group 
(treated textile dye waste water). Each group had eight mice 
(six female and two male). Female and male mice were kept in 
the cages in the ratio of 3:1 (female : male). The females were 
checked for the presence of vaginal plug every morning. The 
day vaginal plug was seen was taken as day 0 of gestation and the female was presumed to be pregnant. Such females were caged singly.  
2.2 Dye waste water:  The textile dye waste  water samples used 
during the present study were collected from an Eff luent 
Treatment Plant (ETP) of a textile dye industry located at Valuka, Mymensingh and stored at 4°C during the study 
period. The waste water was analyzed in the laboratory of 
Department of Environment,  Dhaka. The characteristics of the 
influent (untreate d) and effluent (biologically treated) were as 
follows which were compared with normal water (Table 1). In case of influent, level of Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) 
and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) were higher than the 
limits set by Department of Environment, Bangladesh.

carefully removed, washed in normal saline solution (0.9%), 
blotted and weighed. Total procedures were done with the 
recommendation of the Institutional Ethical committee for 
research. 
2.4 Histopathology of testes and ovary:  Specimens of testes and 
ovary were dissected from all animals immediately after killing, 
washed thoroughly with formal saline and then fixed in 10% neutral -buffered formal saline for 72 hours at least. All the 
specimens were washed in tap water for half an hour, 
dehydrated in ascending grades of alcohol (70 -90-95% absolute), 
cleared in xylene and then embedded in paraffin wax. Serial sections of 6 um thick were cut and stained with Haematoxylin and eosin [18] for histopathological investigation.  
2.5 Statistics:  The data are expressed as mean±SEM. Statistical 
tests (student's `t' -test; one and two way ANOVA) were 
applied to find significant difference be tween values of various parameters recorded for control and treated animals. The 
differences will considered to statistically significant When 
the p value obtained will less than 0.05 or 0.01 
3. RESULTS 
3.1 Body weight and weight of individual reproductive organs:  Body 
weight was significantly lower in treated animals in relation 
to the control group especially for those animals receiving 
influent (Table 2). The percent reduction in body weight was 
greater in influent group (26±0.16) than in effluent group (27±0.52). Similar trends were observed in the weight of testis 
(Table 2) but there was no significant weight variation in the 
weight of ovary.

3.2 Pathological features of testes and ovary:  There were no gross 
abnormalities in both testes and ovary. There was also no 
histopathological lesion in ovary. But histopathological 
alterations of testes were observed in waste water treated mice (Fig 1). These abnormalies were greatest in influent 
group and included the following features: accumulation of  
spermatozoa with exudates in tubular lumen and displacement of seminiferous tubule from basement 
membrane in influent and vascular congestion with marked atrophied spermatozoa in effluent group.

respectively. 
3.5 Progeny: The progeny were observed for 15 days for 
investigating any behavioural changes. But there were no 
behavioural changes were found. After 15 days they were 
sacrificed for observing any gross or histopathological 
changes. There was no gross (Fig 2)  and histopathological 
changes were found in the effluent group in comparison with 
control group.

4. DISCUSSION 
Findings in the present study with acute (30 days) exposure of 
male mice to drinking water from treated (Effluent) and 
untreated (Influent) textile dye wastewater of Valuka, 
Bangladesh showed adverse effect on reproductive parameters. These findings are generally consistent with the 
studies by Gray and Ostby [19], who reported a reduction in 
testicular weight of mice and rats exposed directly to dyes 
such as congo red, diamine bule and chlorazol Black E, which 
may be ascribed to a widespread testicular damage [20]. In the 
present study, body weight of treated animals decreased. This may be due to the heavy metals in the wastewater. Similar results were observed by Ravibau [21] in rats after treated 
with industrial effluent collected from the common effluent 
treatment plant located near Hyderabad. This result also 
found in rats and mice after treated with textile dye waste 
water [6, 22]. The histopathological alterations were also found in testis in the present study. Similar results were also observed by Chowdhury and Naha [23]. It is important to 
note that there was no gross and histopathological changes in 
ovary.  
Himani [24] described that maternal toxicity to certain extent were produced in mice including muscular tremors, at axia, 
convulsions, hypersalivations, lacrimation and restlessness. But in the present study, such type of alterations were not found. Again another study revealed a reduction of litter size 
[25] which is not similar with our study. Our study observed 
that there was no litter from influent treated animal. So the 
reduced ability of mice of influent group to sire a litter would reasonably be explained by the alterations observed in the testes. Histopathological changes may affect the capacitation 
of male mice for fertilization. But the sire from effluent treated 
animal were normal in gross appearance which vary the 
results from another study [24] that showed some external 
malformations in mice.  
In conclusion, the present study indicates that textile dye waste waters of Valuka have severe toxic effects on male reproductive system. The toxicity is, however, relatively mild 
amongst those animals receiving treated (effluent) waste 
water versus those exposed to the untreated (influent) waste 
water. The untreated waste water (influent) caused complete 
sterility in male mice which was not found in treated waste water (effluent). Although other studies suggest some 
alterations in ovary of mice and their progeny due to exposure 
of waste water of textile industry, we did not find convincing 
results to support the results of other studies. Further studies 
are needed to better establish the possible association between 
waste water and female reproductive system of mice and their 
progeny.
