Azo Dye Transformation by Enzymatic and Chemical Systems 
Sangkil Narn 
Supervising Professor: V. Renganathan 
Almost all dyes used in industrial applications are synthetic, and of these, 
approximately 50% are azo dyes. Azo dyes are recalcitrant to biodegradation; yet 
they are released into the environment with little or no treatment. This dissertation 
describes an investigation of azo dye decolorization by peroxidases, hydroxyl radicals, 
zero-valent iron, and NADH. Since azo dyes have widely differing substituent 
patterns, the effect of substituents on the reaction was examined using quantitative 
structure-activity relationships (QSARs). Two different groups of azo dyes were 
used: 4-(4'-sulfopheny1azo)-phenol and 2-(4'-sulfopheny1azo)-phenol. Substituent 
changes were made only in the phenolic ring of the azo dyes. 
Horseradish peroxidase (HRP), manganese peroxidase (MnP), and lignin 
peroxidase (Lip) oxidized a variety of substituted 4-(4'-sulfopheny1azo)-phenol dyes. 
None of the peroxidases oxidized the 2-(4'-sulfopheny1azo)-phenol dyes. HRP was 
the most active in dye oxidation, and Lip was the least active. 
Enzyme reactions can be controlled by electronic factors, steric factors, or 
both. In the Hammett correlation analysis, HRP and MnP oxidation of azo dyes 
exhibited a negative correlation with d constants, suggesting that HRP and MnP 
prefer substrates with electron-donating substituents (-a) in the phenolic ring. MnP 
showed a stronger correlation compared to HRP, suggesting that MnP reactions are 
primarily controlled by electronic factors. HRP showed only a weak correlation, 
suggesting that its reaction could be controlled by electronic and steric factors. Hydroxyl radicals generated using FelI1-EDTA and H,O, at pH 7.0 readily 
decolorized all dyes tested. Substitution of an electron-withdrawing substituent 
increased the rate of dye oxidation. A correlation was observed between the rate of 
decolorization and the charge density of deprotonated azo dyes, suggesting that the 
initial attack of . OH is on the phenolate species of azo dyes whose formation is 
favored when the phenolic ring is substituted with electron-withdrawing substituents. 
All azo dyes tested were reduced by NADH under aerobic conditions to 
produce two aromatic mines. Reduction was favored at low pH. The substituent 
effect was dependent upon the location in the phenolic ring. For example, 
substitution of a chlorine at the Zposition decreased the azo linkage reduction, 
whereas its introduction into the 3-position (ortho to azo linkage) enhanced reduction. 
A Zchlorine substitution decreases the pKa of phenol and favors phenoxide 
formation. The phenoxide donates electron density to the phenolic ring and the azo 
linkage. The increased electron density of the azo linkage might resist reduction by 
NADH. Alternatively, a 3-chlorine substitution might not substantially decrease the 
dye pKa; nevertheless, it can strongly deplete the electron density from azo linkage 
via inductive mechanisms and this could favor reduction of azo linkage. However, 
NADH reduction did not exhibit a strong correlation with parameters such as pKa and 
substituent constants. 
Zero-valent iron readily reduced azo dyes at neutral pH under anaerobic 
conditions. Reduction rates were apparently influenced by mass transport of the dye 
to the iron metal surface. A weak correlation was observed between kb,, the first- 
order rate constant, and energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, suggesting 
that reduction might also be influenced by the reduction potential of the dyes. CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION 
1.1 A Perspective of Azo Dyes 
1.1.1 Introduction to azo dyes 
Dye stuffs are classified based on chemical structure, usage, or application 
method (Zollinger, 1987; Gregory, 1990). Based on chemical structure, they can be 
classified as azo dyes, anthraquinone dyes, triarylrnethane dyes, indigoid dyes, and 
polycyclic aromatic carbonyl dyes (Figure 1.1). Azo dyes constitute more than 50% 
of all dyes produced in the world (Betowski et al., 1987; Zollinger, 1987), and their 
structure is characterized by the presence of an azo linkage (-N=N-). 
Azo dyes are produced by coupling a diazonium salt of an aromatic amhe 
with either a phenol under alkaline conditions or an aromatic amhe under acidic 
conditions (Figure 1.2) (Zollinger, 1987; Gregory, 1990). Since the diazonium salts 
are unstable, the reaction temperature is maintained at 0-4°C. Azo dyes became 
popular because they can be easily synthesized (Glover, 1992). Depending on the 
substituents, azo dyes can be either water-soluble or -insoluble. Azo dyes such as 
food dyes and reactive dyes contain one or more sulfonate (-SO,-) or carboxylate 
(-COO-) groups, which enhance dye solubility in water. These groups also help to 
bind dye molecules to fiber surfaces (polar surfaces) such as wool and cotton (Wade, 
1991). However, water-insoluble dyes such as disperse dyes are hydrophobic and 
contain nitro- and chloro-substituents (Gregory, 1990). Disperse dyes are used for 
dyeing synthetic fibers such as nylon and polyester. Azo dyes ON=N~

degrading fbngus Phanerochaete chrysospon'um. Appl. Environ. Microbial. 58, 2397-2401 .] 1.1.2 Pollution created by azo dyes 
Approximately 3,000 different azo dyes are used in industry (Chudgar, 1992). 
In 1994, over 219,000 tons of synthetic organic colorants were produced in the 
United States alone (U. S. International Trade Commission, 1995). The textile 
industry consumes the largest volume of dyes, and it is also one of the largest water- 
consuming industries in the world (Vaidya & Datye, 1982). It is estimated that 
approximately 10-15% of textile dyes used are discharged in the waste stream during 
the manufacturing processes (Brown et al., 1981). About 20% of dye waste ends up 
in the environment (Clarke & Anliker, 1980). For example, it has been reported that 
at least seven disperse and seven acid dyes, which originated from a carpet mill, were 
found in the Coosa River Basin in Georgia (Tincher & Robertson, 1982). Disperse 
dyes which were released from a textile mill were also found in river water and 
sediments in the Yamaska River in Quebec, Canada (Maguire & Tkacz, 1991). 
In general, synthetic azo dyes have substitutions (such as sulfonic acid, bromo, 
fluoro, nitro, or chloro groups) as part of their structure. Consequently, these azo 
dyes are highly resistant to degradation (Clarke & Anliker, 1980; Kulla et al., 1983). 
Several azo dyes and their reductive metabolism products are toxic (Jungclaus et al., 
1976; Nelson & Hites, 1980; Cartwright, 1983; Matthews et al., 1993). In addition, 
dye industry effluent also contains other environmental contaminants, such as heavy 
metals, detergents, metal complexing agents, dye carriers (e.g., phenols, chlorinated 
benzenes, and phthalates) , and inorganic anions (e. g . , chloride, sulfate, and 
carbonate) (Park & Shore, 1984). Some of these are additives used in the dyeing 
process. Thus, dye industry effluent is a significant source of environmental 
pollution. 
1.1.3 Carcinogenicity and toxicity of azo dyes 
Several synthetic azo dyes have been classified as carcinogens as well as 
mutagens (McCann & Ames, 1975; Krishna et al., 1986; Sandhu & Chipman, 1990; 
Chung & Cerniglia, 1992). For example, azo dyes such as 4-aminoazobenzene, o- 
aminoazotoluene, and 4-methylamino- and 4-dimethylamino-azobenzene are 
carcinogenic as well as mutagenic (McCann et al., 1975). The carcinogenicity of an azo dye may be due either to the dye itself or to the aryl amines derived via the 
reduction transformation of azo dyes. Such reduction can be brought about by 
biological, chemical, or photochemical systems (Riefe, 1992). In mammals, aryl 
amines are oxidized to the corresponding aryl-hydroxylamines, which are further 
transformed to aryl-nitrosoamines by enzymes such as cytochrome P-450, flavin 
monooxygenases, and peroxidases in liver (Kadlubar , 1987). Aryl-hydroxylamines 
and aryl-nitrosaxnines are reactive electrophiles and are capable of forming covalent 
bonds with DNA (Kadlubar, 1987). Azo dyes are reduced to aryl amines by a flavin- 
dependent reductase in liver, an extracellular flavin-dependent reductase produced by 
anaerobic bacteria in the intestine, and even by hepatic cytochrome P-450 under 
anaerobic conditions (Huang et al., 1979; Rafii et al., 1990). For example, azo dyes 
such as Evans Blue, Trypan Blue, Direct BIack 38, and Direct Blue 6 (Figure 1.3) 
include a biphenyl diazo linkage. These dyes are transformed to benzidine (4,4'- 
diaminobiphenyl), a potent carcinogen, via the reductive cleavage of the azo linkage 
(Brown & DeVito, 1993). Other aryl amines that may be generated via hepatic 
reduction of azo dyes are 4-aminobiphenyl, a- and P-naphthylamines, dichloro and 
dimethyl analogs of benzidine and o-toluidine (McCann et al., 1975). 
1.1.4 Processes for eliminating dyes from effluent 
Currently the wastewater from dye industries is treated by physical, chemical, 
and biological methods (Park & Shore, 1984). Physical methods include adsorption, 
chemical precipitation, and reverse osmosis (Riefe, 1992). The adsorption process 
uses activated carbon, and organic pollutants including dyes bind to carbon through 
hydrophobic interaction (Arvanitoyamis et al., 1987; Yang et al., 1988). In the 
chemical precipitation process, salts of ferric iron, calcium, magnesium, ferrous iron, 
and aluminum are used (Fytianos et al., 1985). These inorganic salts form insoluble 
hydroxides at neutral pH. These precipitated hydroxides remove dyes by adsorbing 
dye molecules onto them. In the reverse osmosis process, a semipermeable 
membrane such as cellulose acetate is used. This membrane selectively retains dyes 
and permits only water to pass through (Park & Shore, 1984). Evans Blue H2N S03Na

Figure 1.3 Carcinogenic azo dyes. Chemical processes include reduction and oxidation. In chemical reduction, 
removal of azo dye color is mainly achieved by the cleavage of the azo linkage using 
reducing agents such as sodium borohydride, zinc sulfoxylate, sodium hydrosulfite, 
and thiourea dioxide (Riefe, 1992). Sodium hydrosulfite under alkaline conditions is 
a powerful reducing agent (Riefe, 1992). Azo dyes also can be treated with oxidizing 
agents such as chlorine, bleach, ozone, hydrogen peroxide, Fenton reagent, and 
permanganate (Riefe, 1992). 
Synthetic azo dyes often contain azo, nitro, and sulfo groups. These 
substituents might be responsible for the resistance of azo dyes to biodegradation 
(Zirnmerman et al., 1982). It has been demonstrated that bacterial degradation of dye 
wastes is difficult (Kulla et al., 1983). Dye degradation systems such as activated 
sludge treatments are dependent on soil microorganisms in sediments. These 
organisms do not significantly degrade textile dyes (Pagga & Brown, 1986; Shaul et 
al., 1991). The color removal by these systems primarily results from the dye 
adsorption to biomass (Pagga & Brown, 1986). The lignin-degrading white-rot 
fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium is the only organism that can mineralize both 
sulfonated and non-sulfonated azo dyes to CO, (Paszczynski et al., 1992; Spadaro 
et al., 1992). However, the white-rot fungi are not yet ready for industrial 
application. 
Industrial dye waste treatments are performed in four stages: preliminary, 
primary, secondary, and tertiary stages (Riefe, 1992; Atlas & Bartha, 1993). In the 
preliminary stage, dye wastes are treated by mixing, disinfection, and neutralization. 
In the primary stage, solid dye wastes are removed by physical methods using 
screening, sedimentation, and flotation processes. In the secondary stage treatment, 
pollutants are removed by biological oxidation, biological reduction, chemical 
separation, and physical separation. In tertiary treatment, non-biodegradable dye 
wastes are mainly removed by electrochemical, chemical, or ion exchange methods. 
Among these treatment processes, flocculation with lime, activated charcoal 
adsorption, and biotreatment appear to be popular for removing color from effluents 
(Park & Shore, 1984). Lime treatment and charcoal adsorption generate solid wastes 
which require costly disposal methods. Biotreatment processes rely on indigenous soil microorganisms to degrade dye compounds. Since the synthetic dyes are resistant to 
biodegradation, this process is likely to be inefficient (Brown & Laboureur, 1983; 
Shaul et al., 1991). Thus, there is a need for the development of treatment 
technologies that are more effective in eliminating dyes from waste streams at their 
source. 
1.2 Biological Reduction and Oxidation 
1.2.1 Biological reduction 
1.2.1.1 Bacterial metabolism of azo dyes. A few azo dyes can be 
degraded by bacteria under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Brown & 
Laboureur, 1983; Haug et al., 1991). Both types of degradation are apparently 
initiated by the cleavage of the azo linkage (Walker, 1970; Brown & Laboureur, 
1983). Azo reductases involved in the reductive process require cofactors such as 
NADH and NADPH for maximum activity (Chung & Stevens, 1992). 
In aerobic bacterial degradation, azo dye is intracellularly reduced to primary 
aromatic amines, and the amines are then further metabolized via degradative 
pathways that involve hydroxylations and ring opening reactions (Idaka et al., 1987; 
Chung & Stevens, 1992; Brown & DeVito, 1993). The azo reductases are apparently 
inhibited by oxygen (Mason et al., 1978; Brown & Laboureur, 1983). Bacterial dye 
degradation under aerobic conditions generally requires long adaptation (Yatome et 
al., 1993). Research in the past two decades has suggested that it is difficult to 
isolate bacteria which use azo dye as a sole source of carbon. 
Many azo dyes are readily reduced to the corresponding aromatic amines by 
bacteria under anaerobic conditions (Walker, 1970; Mallett et al., 1982). This 
reduction is non-specific. Since anaerobic bacteria cannot metabolize aromatic amines 
well, most aromatic amines can be further degraded by aerobic bacteria (Berry et al., 
1987; Brown & Hamburger, 1987). For example, Haug et al. (1991) also 
demonstrated that mixed bacterial cultures (Pseudomonas sp. BN9 and BN6), which 
pass through successive anaerobic and aerobic conditions, can mineralize azo dyes to 
CO, (Figure 1.4). This degradation is initiated by the anaerobic cleavage of the azo A) Anaerobic conditions

aminonaphthalene-2-sulfonate-degrading bacteria consortium. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 57, 
3144-3149.1 bond, and the amines generated from that process are further degraded under aerobic 
conditions. Donlon et al. (1997) also demonstrated the partial anaerobic 
mineralization of Mordant Orange 1 (Figure 1.1) in methanogenic consortia under 
anaerobic conditions. However, mineralization was very limited. In their study, 4- 
nitroaniline, a reductive product, was not further mineralized. Zimmerman et al. 
(1982) reported that bacteria isolated from Pseudomonas sp. strains (KF22 and KF46) 
completely degraded Carboxyorange I and 11, but their corresponding sulfo analogs 
(Orange I and 11) were only reduced to the corresponding aromatic amines, which 
were not further degraded. 
1.2.1.2 Azo dye reduction in mammals. In mammals, reductive 
cleavage of azo linkage might occur in the liver (Walker et al., 1971) or in the 
intestinal microflora (Scheline et al., 1970; Zimrnermann et al., 1982; Idaka et al., 
1987). Azo reductases in liver can reduce many azo dyes to their corresponding 
aromatic amines, showing a broad substrate specificity for water-soluble and water- 
insoluble azo dyes (Fujita & Peisach, 1977; De Long et al., 1986; Brown & DeVito, 
1993). They require cofactors such as NADPH, and have variable oxygen 
sensitivities, which depend upon dye substrates. It has been reported that hepatic 
reductase systems in rat liver did not reduce amaranth and tartrazine in the presence 
of oxygen, but they partially reduced Orange I1 and Orange G (Brown & DeVito, 
1993). 
Azo reductases in intestinal bacteria mainly reduce water-soluble azo dyes to 
their corresponding aromatic amines. The aromatic amines generated are mostly 
excreted from the body (Brown & DeVito, 1993). It is possible that less soluble 
amine products are absorbed via the intestinal lining. These reductases are inhibited 
by oxygen. 
1.2.2 Biological oxidation 
1.2.2.1 Degradation of organic pollutants by Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium. The plant cell wall consists of cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose 
(Eriksson et al., 1990). Lignin is the most abundant aromatic polymer in the 
biosphere. It is an optically inactive, heterogeneous, and aromatic biopolymer. Lignin is highly resistant to biodegradation; only white-rot basidiomycetous fungi can 
completely degrade lignin to CO, and H,O (Kirk & Farrell, 1987; Gold et al., 1989; 
Higson, 1991). The lignin-degrading system of white-rot fungi is nonspecific in that 
it can also degrade other aromatic compounds (Bumpus et al., 1985; Tien, 1987; 
Hammel, 1989; Chung & Aust, 1995). 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium is the best studied white-rot fungus. White-rot 
fungi degrade cellulose under primary metabolic conditions and lignin under 
secondary metabolic conditions (Kirk et al., 1978). Lignin degradation is regulated 
by nutrient nitrogen and carbon (Kirk et al., 1978). Lignin-degrading cultures of P. 
chrysosporium produce two extracellular peroxidases-lignin peroxidase (Lip) and 
manganese peroxidase (MnP)-and glyoxal oxidase, an extracellular H,O,-generating 
system (Gold et al., 1984; Kersten & Kirk, 1987; Hammel & Moen, 1991). The 
peroxidases are presumed to depolymerize lignin to the corresponding monomers and 
dimers which are further oxidized by the intracellular enzymes (Hammel & Moen, 
1991). 
In 1980, Eaton et al. reported that P. chrysosporium can degrade chlorinated 
organic compounds. Later, it was reported that lignin-degrading cultures of P. 
chrysosporium are capable of mineralizing polychlorinated biphenyls (Eaton, 1985). 
Priority organic pollutants such as DDT, benzo[a]pyrene, and dioxin were degraded 
by lignin-degrading cultures of P. chrysosporium (Bumpus et al., 1985). These 
studies led to immense interest in the bioremediation capabilities of white-rot fungi. 
Since then, numerous studies have demonstrated that lignin-degrading cultures of P. 
chrysosporium can degrade a number of aromatic pollutants, including nitrotoluenes 
(Fernando et al., 1990; Valli et al., 1992a), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
(Bumpus et al., 1985; Sanglard et al., 1986; Hammel et al., 1991), 2,4,5- 
trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (Ryan & Bumpus, 1989; Yadav & Reddy, 1992), 
polychlorobiphenyls (Dietrich et al., 1995), and alachlor (Ferrey et al., 1994). The 
probable degradation pathways of 2,4-dichlorophenols (Valli & Gold, 1991), 2,7- 
dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (Valli et al., 1992b), 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (Joshi & Gold, 
1993), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (Valli et al., 1992a), phenanthrene (Harnrnel et al., 1992), 
and anthracene (Hammel et al., 199 1) by P. chrysosporium have been proposed. 1.2.2.2 Degradation of synthetic dyes by P. chrysospon'um. Glenn 
and Gold (1983) first demonstrated that the lignin-degrading system of P. 
chrysosporium is capable of decolorizing sulfonated polymeric dyes such as Poly B- 
41 1, Poly R-418, and Poly Y-606. Cripps et al. (1990) demonstrated that P. 
chrysosporium under ligninolytic conditions can decolorize azo dyes such as Orange 
11, Tropeolin 0, and Congo Red. Bumpus and Brock (1988) reported that P. 
chrysosporium can also decolorize triphenylmethane dyes such as Crystal violet, Basic 
green 4, Brilliant green, and Cresol red. Since decolorization does not demonstrate 
complete dye degradation but only transformation of the chromophoric group of dyes, 
Spadaro et al. (1992) examined complete degradation of azo dyes using 14C-labeled 
compounds. They demonstrated that P. chrysosporium under low nitrogen conditions 
can mineralize non-sulfonated hydrophobic azo dyes such as Disperse Yellow 3, N,N- 
dimethylphenylazoaniline, Disperse Orange 3, and Solvent Yellow 14 to CO,. In that 
study, the azo dyes containing aromatic substituents such as amino, acetamido, 
hydroxyl, or nitro groups were found to be mineralized to a greater extent than the 
unsubstituted dyes. Paszczynski et al. (1992) demonstrated that P. chrysosporium can 
also mineralize several water-soluble sulfonated azo dyes. 
1.2.2.3 Degradation of synthetic dyes by other white-rot fungi. A 
common characteristic of white-rot fungi is their ability to degrade lignin under 
nitrogen-limiting conditions. Among these fungi, Phlebia tremellosa, Phlebia radiata, 
Dichomitus squalens, and Trametes versicolor mineralize lignin efficiently (Hatakka, 
1994). Recently, azo dyes such as Reactive Blue 38 and Reactive Violet 5 were 
shown to be decolorized by T. versicolor and Bjerkandera adusta (Heinfling et al., 
1997; Young & Yu, 1997). Remazol Brilliant Blue R was demonstrated to be 
decolorized by an extracellular H202-requiring enzyme extracted from the white-rot 
fungus Pleurotus ostreatus (Shin et al., 1997). Remazol Brilliant Blue R was also 
decolorized by another white-rot fungus, Pycnoporus cinnabarinus (Schliephake & 
Lonergan, 1997). 
I .2.2.4 Oxidation of azo dyes by peroxidases. 
1.2.2.4.1 Peroxidases. In the early 1980s it was first observed 
that ligninolytic cultures of P. chrysosporium produce two extracellular peroxidases, Lip and MnP (Glenn et al., 1983; Tien & Kirk, 1983; Gold et al., 1984). These 
peroxidases were induced under nutrient nitrogen-limiting conditions (Kirk & Farrell, 
1987; Gold et al., 1989). Lip and MnP oxidize several phenol- and aniline-type 
compounds (Glenn et al., 1986; Kirk et al., 1986; Renganathan & Gold, 1986; 
Wariishi et al., 1989b). 
The catalytic cycles of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), Lip, and MnP are 
similar (Figure 1.5) (Chance, 1952; Renganathan & Gold, 1986; Wariishi et al., 
1988). In this cycle, the native enzyme, which is in the ferric (Feu') form, is first 
oxidized by H202 to produce compound I, a two-electron oxidized intermediate. 
Compound I is then reduced by the one-electron oxidation of substrate, forming 
compound 11, a ferryl-0x0 intermediate. Reduction of compound I1 by a second 
electron of substrate brings the enzyme back to the native enzyme and completes the 
catalytic cycle. The catalytic cycle of MnP is different from those of other 
peroxidases, because MnP requires Mnn as an electron donor (Figure 1.5) (Wariishi 
et al., 1988). In the catalytic cycle, Mn" is oxidized to Mn"' (Wariishi et al., 1989a). 
In the absence of substrate and in the presence of excess H202, compound I1 is 
converted to compound 111, a ferrous-oxy or ferric superoxide species. In this 
process, H202 reduces compound I1 by one electron to produce a ferric enzyme and a 
superoxide radical. The latter readily combines with the ferric peroxidase to produce 
compound 111. 
Veratryl alcohol (VA) (3 ,bdimethoxybenzyl alcohol) is a fungal secondary 
metabolite produced in ligninolytic cultures of P. chrysosporium (Eriksson et al., 
1990; Valli et al., 1990). Lip can oxidize a poor substrate efficiently in the presence 
of VA. However, in the absence of VA, Lip is inactivated because it is readily 
converted to compound 111. VA can help Lip oxidation of poor substrates by two 
different mechanisms (Valli et al., 1990; Wariishi & Gold, 1990). Since it is a good 
substrate, it could readily reduce compound I1 and thus avoid formation of compound 
111. Alternatively, Lip can also revert compound I11 to the native enzyme by 
releasing a superoxide from compound 111. The exact mechanism by which VA 
releases superoxide from compound I11 is not known. Figure 1.5 Catalytic cycles for Lip (1) and MnP (2).

127-140.1 1.2.2.1.2 Mechanism for the oxidation of azo dyes by 
peroxidases. Substrates of Lip, MnP, and HRP include various substituted phenols 
and anilines. Peroxidases are known to dehalogenate, denitrate, and desulfonate these 
aromatic substrates (Figure 1.6) (Valli & Gold, 1991; Valli et al., 1992; 
Muralikrishna & Renganathan, 1993). Thus peroxidases readily oxidize azo dyes that 
are substituted with either an hydroxyl or mine group. Recently our laboratory 
proposed the mechanism of oxidation of Orange I1 (a water-soluble azo dye) and an 
analog of Disperse Yellow 3 (a hydrophobic azo dye) by peroxidases (Spadaro & 
Renganathan, 1994; Chivukula et al., 1995). Goszcyznski et al. (1994) also reported 
the possible mechanism of azo dye oxidation by Lip. However, the initial steps of 
dye oxidation mechanisms proposed in the two reports are similar. 
1-(4'-Acetamidopheny1azo)-2-naphthol (NDY3) is an analog of Disperse 
Yellow 3 (DY3). In the oxidation of NDY3, peroxidases successively oxidize the 
naphthol ring of NDY3 by two one-electron steps to produce a carbonium ion on the 
C- 1 carbon of the naphthol ring (Figure 1.7). Then, an unstable tetrahedral 
intermediate is produced by nucleophilic attack of H,O. This intermediate breaks 
down to generate 1,2-naphthoquinone and 4-acetamidophenyldiazine. One-electron 
oxidation of phenyldiazene by 0, generates a phenyldiazene radical. The latter 
radical loses the azo linkage as nitrogen via homolytic bond cleavage to yield an 
acetamidophenyl radical, which abstracts a hydrogen radical from the organic 
impurities in the medium to yield acetanilide. 
Oxidation of Orange I1 by Lip generated 1,2-naphthoquinone and a novel 4- 
sulfophenyl hydroperoxide (Chivukula et al., 1995). The mechanism for oxidation of 
Orange I1 is similar to the NDY3 mechanism. Orange I1 oxidation by peroxidases 
generate 1,2-naphthoquinone and 4-sulfophenyl diazene. The latter is non- 
enzymatically oxidized first to sulfophenyl diazene radical and then to sulfophenyl 
radical. The phenyl radical is then scavenged by oxygen to produce a stable 4- 
sulfophenyl hydroperoxide (SPH). SPH is novel because it is the first phenyl 
hydroperoxide known in organic chemistry (Chivukula et al., 1995). It is also 
unusual in that it is stable in the presence of transition metals, and hydroperoxide can 
be displaced with azide and iodide by nucleophilic substitution reaction. Formation of NH2

Disperse Yellow 3 degradation. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 312, 301-307.1 SPH is also interesting, because phenyl radicals are not supposed to react with 
oxygen; they are only known to abstract a hydrogen radical from suitable organic 
compounds. For example, the acetamidophenyl radical formed from NDY3 does not 
react with 0,; instead it abstracts a hydrogen radical from dioxane, which is added to 
the reaction mixture (Spadaro & Renganathan, 1994). 
1.2.2.5 Oxidation of azo dyes by laccases. Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2) 
are extracellular copper-dependent phenol oxidases produced by plants and white-rot 
fungi (Bollag, 1992; De Jong et al., 1992; Givaudan et al., 1993; Thurston, 1994). 
Laccase can oxidize aromatic organic pollutants such as phenolic compounds and 
aromatic amines in the presence of oxygen (Hoff et al., 1985; Bollag et al., 1988). 
Laccase oxidizes substrates to the corresponding phenoxy radicals by one-electron 
processes. The resulting phenoxy radicals are either polymerized to a phenolic 
polymer or further oxidized to a quinone. Electrons that the laccase receives in the 
process are transferred to oxygen, which is reduced to water (Bollag, 1992). 
Chivukula and Renganathan (1995) demonstrated oxidation of phenolic azo 
dyes by laccase from Pyricularia oryzae. Their study showed that the proposed 
mechanism for phenolic azo dye oxidation is very similar to that of peroxidase. 
However, the laccase from P. oryzae appeared to be less efficient than peroxidases, 
oxidizing only a selected number of dyes. 
1.3 New Technologies For Azo Dye Waste Treatment 
1.3.1 Advanced oxidation processes 
Hydroxyl radicals (. OH) are the most potent oxidants known. They generally 
can degrade any organic compound to CO, (Kunai et al., 1986; Cha et al., 1996; 
Bahorsky, 1997). Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) make use of this high 
oxidation potential of - OH. These technologies generate . OH using UV/H,O,, 
UVIO,, and TiO, (Watts et al., 1990; Masten & Davies, 1994; Shu et al., 1994; 
Hong et al., 1996). AOPs are particularly useful alternatives for eliminating organic 
pollutants which are resistant to biodegradation (Kuo, 1992; Leung et al., 1992; 
Legrini et al., 1993; Masten & Davis, 1994; Shu et al., 1994). Applications of AOPs to the treatment of industrial wastewater and groundwater have been demonstrated 
(Baozhen & Jun, 1986; Ruppert et al., 1994; Gunten & Olivers, 1997). 
1.3.2 Photochemical oxidation 
The common oxidizing agents used for the photochemical degradation of azo 
dyes are hydrogen peroxide (H,O,), chlorine (Cl,), fluorine (F,), and ozone (0,) 
(Langlais et al., 1991; Riefe, 1992; Hong et al., 1996; Gunten & Olivers, 1997). 
Practically, ozone treatment removes dye wastes, but ozonation is expensive 
and has limited efficiency (Matsui et al., 1981; Park & Shore, 1984; Masten & 
Davies, 1994). The UVIO, system produces OH as shown in equations 1.1 and 1.2 
(Ruppert et al., 1994; Hong et al., 1996): 
O3 + H20 + hv -* H202 + 0, (1.1) 
H202 + hv+2-OH (1.2) 
UVITiO, and UV/H202 systems have been used for removal of organic 
contaminants (Ruppert et al., 1994; Vinodgopal & Kamat, 1995; Gunten & Olivers, 
1997). These systems have some advantages such as high stability at wide range of 
pH, non-toxicity, and cost effectiveness (Matthews, 1991). 
In UV/Ti02 and UV/H,O, systems, OH is generated as shown in equations 
1.3-1.5 (Kormann et al., 1988; Laat et al., 1994; Ruppert et al., 1994; Vinodgopal & 
Kamat, 1995): 
TiO, + hv + hvb+ + e,; (1.3) 
hVb+ + OH- -* -OH (1.4) 
H202 + hv+2.OH (1.5) 
Where hv = photon, hvb+ = valence band holes, and e,; = conduction band 
electrons. 
1.3.3 Chemical oxidation 
Fenton (1894) reported that a mixture of ferrous ion (Fel*) and hydrogen 
peroxide (H202) oxidizes tartaric acid to dihydroxy maleic acid. Later it was proved 
that a combination of ferrous salts and H202 (Fenton's reagent) is an effective oxidant 
of various organic substrates (Walling, 1975). In 1934, Haber and Weiss proposed that hydroxyl radicals ( . OH) are the actual oxidant generated by the decomposition of 
H,O, by iron. 
In Fenton's system, a ferrous (Feu) or ferric (Feu') salt (Fenton's reagent) 
reacts with H,O, to generate - OH as shown in equations 1.6-1.12 (Walling, 1975; 
Pignatello, 1992) : 
Fe" + H,O, + H+ + Fell1 + -OH + H20 (1.6) 
Fe"' + H202 - Fe-OOH2+ + H+ (1.7) 
Fe-OOH2+ -, HO, . + Fen (1.8)

Fe"' + HO,. -+ Fen + 0, + H+ (1.10) 
Feu + -OH -. OH- + Feu' (1.11) 
- OH + H202 -+ H20 + H02 (1.12) 
Various transition metal ions in lower oxidation states, such as Cur, Ti1", Con, 
and Cr", can be used as substitutes for iron in the Fenton reaction (Czapski et al., 
1971; Heckrnan & Espenson, 1979). The general reaction of a transition metal with 
H,O, is shown in equation 1.13 (Goldstein et al., 1993): 
Mn+ + H,O, + H+ -. Mcn+ ') + H,O + OH (1.13) 
1.3.4 Degradation of organic pollutants by AOPs 
The hydroxyl radical reacts with aromatic compounds very rapidly and has 
very high oxidation potential (I& = 2.02) (Anbar et al., 1966; Walling, 1975; Hoigne 
et al., 1989; Leung et al., 1992). In addition, - OH reacts nonspecifically with most 
organic compounds (Walling, 1975; Masten & Davies, 1994). Kunai et al. (1986) 
studied the mechanism of benzene degradation by Fenton's reagent. Organic 
pollutants such as chlorophenoxy herbicides (Pignatello, 1992) and formaldehyde 
(Murphy et al., 1989) were mineralized by the FeHr/H202 system. Some azo dyes 
were also degraded by the FeH/H2O2 system (Kuo, 1992; Solozhenko et al., 1995). 
Removal of textile dyes in wastewater was examined using the UV/H,O, system (Prat 
et al., 1988; Ince & Goenenc, 1997). Other examples are summarized in Table 1.1. 
However, the utility of AOPs in eliminating azo dyes from waste streams remains to 
be proven. Table 1.1 Azo Dye Degradation by AOPs.

suggested as an alternative for removing color from dye-containing industrial effluents 
(Kuo, 1992). However, a detailed study of this process has not been published. 
Most reports have been based on monitoring only the loss of color as an indication of 
dye degradation. Decolorization generally demonstrates only the transformation of 
the chromophoric group of dyes; it does not demonstrate total dye degradation (Bigda 
& Elizardo, 1992). Spadaro et al. (1994) examined the mineralization of 14C-labeled 
azo dyes to CO, using the FeU'/H2O2 system. In addition, they suggested the 
mechanism for benzene generation from phenyl azo substituted dyes (Figure 1.8). 
The proposed mechanism involves initial addition of OH to the C-4 carbon of the 
phenyl ring. The resulting . OH adduct then breaks down to generate phenyldiazene 
and a phenoxy radical. Phenyldiazene is very unstable, so . OH or 0, were proposed 
to oxidize this intermediate to a phenyldiazene radical. This latter radical is also 
unstable, and is homolytically cleaved to produce a phenyl radical and N,. 
Subsequently, the phenyl radical was suggested to abstract a hydrogen radical from 
- 02H, dye-degradation products, or Tween-80 (a detergent added to the reaction) to 
generate benzene. The phenoxy radical was proposed to be further degraded to C02 
by . OH and oxygen (Spadaro et al., 1994). 
1.4 Thesis Outline 
In order to gain a detailed insight into azo dye degradation, the oxidation and 
reduction of azo dyes by enzymatic and chemical systems under aerobic and anaerobic 
conditions were investigated. Peroxidases such as HRP, MnP, and Lip and hydroxyl 
radicals ( - OH) were used for dye oxidation; zero-valent iron (FeO) and NADH were 
used for dye reduction. Only the study of dye reduction by FeO was performed under 
anaerobic conditions. Other studies were done under aerobic conditions. 
In Chapter 2, substrate specificity of peroxidases such as HRP, MnP, and Lip 
for azo dyes is investigated. In total, 35 azo dyes were tested. Substituents were 
introduced into the 2- and 3-position of 4-(4'-sulfophenylazo) phenol. In the case of 
HRP, the oxidation rates for Zsubstituted dyes were 116-486 mrnol min-' mg-' Phenyldiazene OH, o2 i 
Aromatic ring cleavage

substituted dyes is shown to be dependent upon the nature of the substituents. In the 
case of MnP, only the 2-methoxy substituted dye among mono-substituted dyes is 
oxidized, but others are either poor substrates or non-substrates. All MnP reactions 
appear to be mediated by a Mnl"-malonate complex. In the case of Lip, all of the 
azo dyes examined serve as poor substrates. In QSAR studies, the Harnmett 
correlations for azo dye oxidation by HRP and MnP are weak and strong, 
respectively, and Lip oxidation does not indicate any correlation. 
In Chapter 3, all of the azo dyes tested are oxidized by OH generated by the 
Fe111/H,02 system. In QSAR studies for the dye oxidation by . OH, the charge density 
of the phenolate anion is the best correlated. This result suggests that the dye 
oxidation by - OH might be controlled by the charge density of phenolate. Based on a 
QSAR study and product analyses, the probable mechanism is proposed. Azo dye 
oxidation is influenced by the nature and position of substituents. Most additives, 
except sodium sulfate and potassium nitrate, decrease the dye oxidation by - OH. In 
particular, potassium nitrate greatly enhances the dye oxidation. 
In Chapter 4, azo dyes including food and pharmaceutical dyes are non- 
enzymatically reduced by NADH. The HPLC and GC-MS analyses indicate that the 
cleavage of azo linkage by NADH readily generates corresponding aromatic arnines. 
Dye reduction is a strong pH-dependent reaction, showing that dye reduction 
increases with decreasing pH values. The probable mechanism for azo dye reduction 
by NADH is proposed. NADH is selective in dye reduction, and azo dye reduction is 
strongly affected by its substituents. 
In Chapter 5, all of the azo dyes examined are reduced by the Fe0/H20 system 
under anaerobic conditions. Dye reduction appears to be the first-order reaction. 
The correlation between kb, and the mixing rate demonstrates that the observed 
reduction rates are controlled by mass transport of dye to the iron metal surface. 
However, the correlation between k,,, and the energy of their lowest unoccupied 
molecular orbital (EL",,) suggests that dye reduction is also influenced by reduction 
potentials of dyes. CHAPTER 2 
A QSAR STUDY OF AZO DYE OXIDATION BY PEROXIDASES 
2.1 Introduction 
Only white-rot basidiomycete fungi can degrade recalcitrant lignin, an aromatic 
biopolymer, to CO, and H,O (Kirk & Farrell, 1987; Gold et al., 1989). This lignin- 
degrading system is nonspecific and nonstereoselective; consequently, it is also 
effective in degrading recalcitrant organic pollutants (Tien, 1987; Chung & Aust, 
1995). The white-rot basidiomycete fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporiurn, the best- 
studied of the white-rot basidiomycete fungi, produces two extracellular heme 
peroxidases-lignin peroxidase (Lip) and manganese peroxidase (MnP)-under 
nitrogen-limiting culture conditions. These two enzymes, along with an extracellular 
H202-generating system (glyoxal oxidase), are the major components of the lignin 
degradative system (Gold et al., 1984; Tien & Kirk, 1984; Glenn & Gold, 1985; 
Kersten & Kirk, 1987). 
Glenn and Gold (1983) first demonstrated that P. chrysosporiurn cultures can 
decolorize some polymeric dyes. Subsequently, several laboratories also 
demonstrated the decolorization of azo dyes such as Congo Red, Acid Red 88, 
Orange I1 [1-(4'-sulfopheny1azo)-2-naphthol], Acid Red 114, Tropeolin 0, Direct blue

cultures of P. chrysosporiurn (Cripps et al., 1990; Paszczynski & Crawford, 1991; 
Paszczynski et al., 1991). Spadaro et al. (1992) and Paszczynski et al. (1992) 
showed that P. chrysosporiurn cultures are able to completely mineralize sulfonated 
and nonsulfonated azo dyes to CO,. Lip and MnP produced under nitrogen-limiting 
culture conditions were proposed to initiate the mineralization of azo dyes (Figure

Chivukula, M., Spadaro, J. T., and Renganathan, V. (1995) Lignin peroxidase-oxidation of sulfonated 
azo dyes generates novel sulfophenyl hydroperoxidases. Biochemistry 34, 7765-7772.1 Our laboratory studied the oxidation of two commercial azo dyes, Disperse 
Yellow 3 and Orange 11, by horseradish peroxidase (HRP), Lip, and MnP (Spadaro & 
Renganathan, 1994; Chivukula et al., 1995). Disperse Yellow 3 [2-(4'- 
acetamidophenylazo)-4-methylphenol] was oxidized to 4-methyl-l,2-benzoquinone, 
acetanilide, and a dimer of Disperse Yellow 3. Orange I1 was oxidized to 1,2- 
naphthoquinone and 4-sulfophenyl hydroperoxide. In these reactions, the H202- 
oxidized form of a peroxidase initiates the oxidation of the phenolic ring of Disperse 
Yellow 3 or Orange I1 by two electrons to produce a carbonium ion. A nucleophilic 
attack by H20 on the carbon bearing the azo linkage generates a quinone and a phenyl 
diazene. The phenyl diazene is oxidized either by 0, or by the H20,-oxidized form of 
peroxidase to yield the corresponding phenyl diazene radical, which readily eliminates 
the azo linkage as nitrogen to yield a phenyl radical. In the oxidation of Disperse 
Yellow 3, this phenyl radical yields acetanilide by the abstraction of a hydrogen 
radical from the organic impurities in the medium. However, in the oxidation of 
Orange 11, this phenyl radical is scavenged by oxygen to produce a novel 4- 
sulfophenyl hydroperoxide in the medium (Figure 2.1). 
In this study, substrate specificity of HRP, Lip, and MnP for azo dyes is 
examined to understand the effect of substituents on peroxidase-dependent oxidation of 
azo dyes. Substituents of azo dyes tested included methyl, methoxy, chloro, bromo, 
iodo, fluoro, and nitro groups. Only the substituents on the phenolic rings of azo 
dyes were altered (Figure 2.2). 
In biological systems, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) 
help in understanding the correlation between the rate of microbial degradation or 
enzymatic reaction and the molecular descriptors of a series of structurally similar 
substrates (Paris et al., 1982; Dolfing & Tiedje, 1991; Hansch & Gao, 1997; 
Kubinyi, 1997). Hence QSARs provide a useful means for predicting biological 
reactivity between similar substrates (Hsuanyu & Dunford, 1992; Ryu & Dordick, 
1992; Hansch & Gao, 1997). The Hammett correlation is an empirical relationship 
between substituent constants and reactivity (Ritchie, 1990; Roe & Goodin, 1993; 
Hansch & Gao, 1997; Tratnyek, 1998). The Hammett equation and its extensions 
have been applied to enzymatic systems. Kobayashi et al. (1987) used the Hammett 4-(4'-Su1fophenylazo)-phenol derivatives

and chloroperoxidase. In that study, para-substituted thioanisoles were oxidized by 
HRP compound 11. BlCe and Schuber (1989) also found a linear Hammett correlation 
between the substituents and the formation of para-substituted thioanisole sulfoxides 
catalyzed by a soybean sulfoxidase. That Hammett correlation suggested that S- 
oxygenation involved a one-electron transfer mechanism. Ryu and Dordick (1992) 
examined the usefulness of the Hammett correlation for evaluating solvent effects on 
HRP catalysis. The Hammett correlation for phenol oxidation with compound I1 of 
prostaglandin H synthase and compound I and compound I1 of HRP suggested that the 
electronic effect of the substituent is predominant in determining the phenol oxidation 
rate (Job & Dunford, 1976; Dunford & Adeniran, 1986; Hsuanyu & Dunford, 1992). 
In this study, the correlation between the specific activity of HRP, MnP, and 
Lip and substituent constants (a, 6, d', and a+) in peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of 
azo dyes was examined. This correlation might provide a useful method to 
understand the mechanism of azo dye oxidation by peroxidases and to predict the 
susceptibility of an azo dye to peroxidatic degradation. 
2.2 Materials and Methods 
2.2.1 Chemicals 
4-Aminobenzenesulfonic acid, 2,6-dimethylphenol, 2-dianisidine, sodium 
nitrite, guaiacol, and all substituted phenols were purchased from Aldrich Chemical 
Company (Milwaukee, WI). Horseradish peroxidase (Type VIa), 2,2'-azino-bis(3- 
ethylthiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS), and H202 were obtained from Sigma Chemical 
Company (St. Louis, MO) and used as received. 
2.2.2 Synthesis of azo dyes 
Azo dyes were prepared by coupling the diazonium salt of 4- 
aminobenzenesulfonic acid with substituted phenols at 0-5°C under alkaline 
conditions as described (Goszczynski et al., 1994). Synthesis of 4-(4'- 
sulfopheny1azo)-phenol is described as an example (Chivukula & Renganathan, 1995): 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid (125 mmol) was mixed with sodium nitrite (125 mmol) 
in 1 N NaOH (12.5 ml). The diazonium salt of 4-arninobenzenesulfonic acid was 
formed by the slow addition of 3 N HCl (8.5 ml). The diazonium salt, which 
precipitated from solution, was reacted with a cold basic solution of phenol (125 
rnmol) in 1 N NaOH (12.5 ml) for 10 min. The reaction temperature was maintained 
at 0-5°C during the coupling reaction. The precipitated product was completely 
dissolved by boiling on the steam bath. This dye solution was acidified with HC1, 
concentrated, and then crystallized. 
The crude azo dye was filtered, rinsed three times with water, and dried at 
room temperature. All crude azo dyes synthesized were purified by silica gel column 
chromatography with a mixture of 5-10% methanol and ethyl acetate as an eluent. 
All azo dyes were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography using a 
reverse phase C-18 column with the water-methanol (1: 1) solvent system. All azo 
dyes synthesized indicated > 98% purity. The structures of all azo dyes were 
confirmed by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry using a VG Analytical 
7070E mass spectrometer equipped with an Ion-Tech saddle field atom gun operated 
with xenon at 6 kV (Chivukula et al., 1995). 
2.2.3 Preparations of lignin and manganese peroxidases 
Lip and MnP were purified from the extracellular medium of lignin-degrading 
cultures of P. chrysosporium as previously described (Gold et al., 1984). The 
specific activity of lignin peroxidase for the oxidation of veratryl alcohol was 20.9 
Ulmg (Wariishi & Gold, 1990). The specific activity of manganese peroxidase, as 
determined by monitoring the oxidation of Mn" to Mn"', was 10.1 Ulmg (Wariishi et 
al., 1992). 
2.2.4 Azo dye reaction by peroxidases 
Peroxidases (0.1-3 pg) were incubated with an azo dye (50 pM) and H202 (25 
or 100 pM) in an appropriate buffer (1 ml) at room temperature. HRP reactions were 
performed in 10 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.0). MnP reactions were performed 
in 50 mM malonate (pH 4.5) containing 0.5 mM MnSO,. Lip reactions were performed in 20 mM sodium succinate (pH 4.5). Lip reaction included veratryl 
alcohol (10 pM) to enhance enzyme activity and to prevent enzyme inactivation 
(Wariishi & Gold, 1990). The determination for azo dye oxidation was done by 
monitoring the decrease of absorbance at the maximum wavelength for azo dye with a 
UV-visible spectrophotometer (Model UV-265, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). 
The amount of azo dye oxidation was calculated from the corresponding extinction 
coefficients of azo dyes tested. HRP and Lip reactions for substrates, such as 2- 
dianisidine, 2,6-dimethylphenol, guaiacol, and ABTS, were performed as described 
above for azo dyes. 
2.2.5 Comparing Mnm-malonate reaction with MnP reaction 
A solution of Mn"' acetate (10 mM) in 0.5 M malonate (pH 4.5) was 
prepared. Azo dye (50 pM) was added to 50 mM malonate buffer (pH 4.5). Then, 
100 p1 of MnU'-malonate (1 pmol) complex was added to this mixture in 10 aliquots 
over 1 h at room temperature. The reaction volume was 1 ml. The amount of azo 
dye oxidation was determined by monitoring the decrease in absorbance due to color 
loss at maximum wavelength of each azo dye tested. 
MnP reaction was performed in 50 mM malonate (pH 4.5) containing 50 pM 
azo dye, 0.5 mM MnSO,, and 100 pM H20,, as described previously. The reaction 
time was 1 h at room temperature, and then the color loss was compared with the 
Mnl"-malonate reaction. 
2.2.6 Correlation analysis 
Substituent constants (a, 6, 8, and a+) have been previously calculated 
(Exner, 1978). a values of ortho-substituents were substituted with those of the 
corresponding para-substituents. The a value for a multi-substituted substrate was 
determined by adding substituent constants for each position. 
Other parameters, such as energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital 
(E,,,,), half-wave potential (E,,,), and ionization constants (pKa), were calculated by 
using CAChe computer program of Oxford Molecular (Beaverton, OR). 2.3 Results 
In this study, the effect of substituent introduction into the 2- and 3-position of 
4-(4'-sulfopheny1azo)-phenol on its oxidation by HRP, MnP, and Lip was examined. 
These substituent changes were made only in the phenolic ring of azo dyes (Figure 
2.2). In total, 35 substituted azo dyes were investigated (Table 2.1). 
2.3.1 Substrate specificity of HRP 
HRP oxidized all the mono-substituted 4-(4'-sulfopheny1azo)-phenol dyes, 
except nitro-substituted dye (Table 2.1). High oxidation rates were observed with 2- 
methyl, 2-methoxy , 2-fluoro, Zchloro, and 2-iodo substituents. In general, the 
oxidation rates for 2-substituted dyes were higher than those of 3-substituted dyes. 
HRP also oxidized several di-substituted dyes, and the preferred substitution pattern 
was dependent on the nature of the substituent. Thus, the 2,5-disubstitution was 
preferred for the methyl group, 2,3-disubstitutions were preferred for methoxy and 
chloro groups, and 2,6-disubstitution was preferred for the fluoro group. The 3,5- 
disubstitution pattern appears to be the least preferred for any substituent. The 2,3-, 
2,5-, and 2,6-disubstituted dyes were oxidized at lower rates compared to the 
corresponding 2-substituted dyes. The only exception to this observation was the 2,5- 
dimethyl-substituted dye which was oxidized at a faster rate compared to the 2-methyl 
dye. HRP oxidation rates for 2,3,5- and 2,3,6-trimethyl-substituted dyes were 1109 
and 751 pmol min-' mg-', respectively. The specific activity of the 2,3,5-trimethyl 
dye was comparable to that of other standard peroxidase substrates such as 2- 
dianisidine, guaicol, and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylthiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) (Table 
2.2). This suggests that the 2,3,5-trimethyl dye could be routinely used for assaying 
HRP and other peroxidases. 
2.3.2 Substrate specificity of MnP 
MnP is unique because its preferred substrate is Mnn. MnP oxidizes Mn" to 
MnH1, which is complexed by chelators such as oxalate, malonate, or lactate (Glenn et 
al., 1986; Wariishi et al., 1992; Kuan et al., 1993). The Mn"' complex functions as Table 2.1 Oxidation of substituted phenolic azo dyes by HRP, MnP, and LIP

*Azo dyes synthesized. 
'~ot determined a diffusible redox mediator. It diffuses away from the enzyme active site and 
oxidizes phenols (Glenn et al., 1986; Wariishi et al., 1992). MnP oxidized the 2- 
methoxy-substituted dye among all the mono-substituted 4-(4'-sulfopheny1azo)-phenol 
derivatives (Table 2.1). Other mono-substituted dyes were either poor substrates or 
non-substrates for MnP. Among the di-substituted dyes, the 2,3-dimethyl-, 2,5- 
dimethyl-, 2,6-dimethyl-, and 2,6-dirnethoxy-substituted dyes were oxidized by MnP, 
and the observed activity ranged from 32 to 129 pmol mid mg-'. The 2,3,6- 
trimethyl-substituted dye was the best substrate for MnP, and it was oxidized at the 
rate of 206.1 pmol min-' mg-'. The 2,3,5-trimethyl-substituted dye (0.3 pmol min-' 
mg-I), the best substrate for HRP, was oxidized by MnP very sluggishly. Halogen- 
substituted dyes were either very poor substrates or non-substrates for MnP. 
Substrate specificity for azo dye oxidation by chemically prepared Mnl"-malonate 
complex was the same as that of MnP, suggesting that all MnP reactions were 
mediated by a Mnl"-malonate complex (Table 2.3). 
2.3.3 Substrate specificity of LiP 
All of the azo dyes examined served as poor substrates for Lip. A possible 
reason is that, unlike other peroxidases, Lip does not oxidize phenols efficiently. A 
high level of H,O,, particularly in the absence of a suitable substrate, is known to 
inactivate Lip. Chung and Aust (1995) demonstrated that the high concentration of 
H,O, lowers the initial oxidation rate of phenol. Wariishi and Gold (1990) suggested 
that veratryl alcohol, a secondary metabolite of P. chrysosporium, protected Lip from 
enzyme inactivation. Pasti-Grigsby et al. (1992) demonstrated that the oxidation of 
azo dyes by Lip proceeded at a faster rate in the presence of veratryl alcohol. Hence, 
the oxidation of azo dyes was examined in the absence and in the presence of 10 pM 
veratryl alcohol. Inclusion of veratryl alcohol increased the azo dye oxidation rate 
two-fold, but rates were not comparable to those of HRP and MnP. 
All of the 2-(4'-sulfopheny1azo)-phenol dyes tested were poor substrates or 
non-substrates for HRP, MnP, and Lip. Probably lower oxidation rates of 2-(4'- 
sulfopheny1azo)-phenol dyes than those of 4-(4'-sulfopheny1azo)-phenol dyes result 
from the steric hindrance between the OH substituent and azo linkage (Figure 2.2). Table 2.3 Comparison of azo dye oxidation by MnP

2-(4'-Sulfopheny1azo)-phenol dyes can exist in the phenolic form or in its alternate 
tautomeric structure hydrazo form. The latter form is likely to be either a non- 
substrate or poor substrate because it is not a phenol. Thus, possibly the 
concentration of individual tautomeric forms could affect its oxidation. 
4. Discussion 
Biological QSARs are useful for studying relationships between microbial or 
enzyme activities and physical properties of closely related substrates (Dorn & 
Knackmuss, 1978; Paris et al., 1982; Dolfing & Tiedje, 1991; Hansch & Gao, 1997). 
The Hammett correlation, which assesses the electronic effect of substituents on 
organic reactions, has been successfully applied to enzyme reactions also (Reineke & 
Knackmuss, 1978; Hsuanyu & Dunford, 1992; Kubinyi, 1997). The Hammett 
equation is described as shown in equation 1: 
log kx - log k, = pax (2.1) 
where kx is the reaction rate constant of the substituted (with electronic effects of 
substituents) substrate, and k, is the reaction rate constant of unsubstituted (without 
electronic effects of substituents) substrate. ax is a substituent constant, which 
reflects the ability of a substituent to change the electron density at a reaction site. A 
positive a indicates that the substituent tends to withdraw electron density from the 
aromatic ring, whereas a negative a indicates that the substituent tends to donate 
electron density to the ring (BlCe & Schuber, 1989; Ritchie, 1990; Hansch & Gao, 
1997; Tratnyek, 1998). This depends on the nature of the substituent and the position of the substituent on the aromatic ring. p, a reaction constant, is a measure of the 
reaction sensitivity to substituent effects. This equation was originally applied only to 
aromatic compounds with either meta- or para-substituents (Job & Dunford, 1976; 
Dolfing & Tiedje, 1991). However, later extensions of the Hammett equation 
included ortho-substituents, and their correlations used para-substituent constants for 
ortho-substituents also (Fujita and Nishioka, 1976; HoignC and Bader, 1993; Elovitz 
& Fish, 1994; Tratnyek, 1998). 
a was originally determined using the dissociation of benzoic acids in water at 
25°C (Blake & Coon, 1981; Ritchie, 1990). However, recently variations of a values 
such as C, 8, and a' have been used for assessing the effects of resonance 
interactions between the substituents and the reaction sites (Shorter, 1982; Brezonik, 
1990; Ritchie, 1990; Hansch & Gao, 1997). d values, derived from the ionization of 
phenols or anilines in water, are used for dealing direct resonance interactions 
between negatively charged reaction sites and substituents. 8 values are based on 
ionization of substituted phenylacetic acids, and in this case the substituent does not 
have resonance interaction with the reaction site (Ritchie, 1990). a+ values, derived 
from t-cumyl chloride solvolysis studies, correlate aromatic electrophilic substitution 
reactions with aromatic substituents (Ritchie, 1990; Hansch & Gao, 1997). 
The Harnmett correlation has been applied to the oxidation of substituted 
phenols by peroxidases. Dunford and coworkers correlated the oxidation of meta- 
and para-substituted phenols by HRP compound I, HRP compound 11, and 
prostaglandin H synthase compound I1 with the Harnmett equation (Job & Dunford, 
1976; Dunford & Adeniran, 1986; Hsuanyu & Dunford, 1992). Phenol derivatives 
examined in that study included substituents such as -NH2, -OCH,, -CH,, -OH, 
-SO<, -C1, -CHO, -C2H5, -OC2H5, and COO-. They observed that electron- 
donating substituents such as -NH2, -OCH3, and -CH3 enhanced the oxidation of 
phenols, whereas electron-withdrawing substituents such as -SO3- and -C1 decreased 
the oxidation of phenols. The p values for the oxidation of phenols by HRP 
compound I, HRP compound 11, and prostaglandin H synthase were -6.9, -4.6 + 
0.5, and -2.0 _f 0.1, respectively. These p values indicate that HRP compound I is more sensitive to the electronic effects of substituents than HRP compound I1 and 
prostaglandin H synthase compound 11. 
In this study, the Hamrnett correlation was applied to peroxidase-catalyzed azo 
dye oxidation. The correlation with a, 6, 8, and a+ values was examined (Figure 
2.3A, B, C, and D and Table 2.4). The Harnmett correlation with 6 provided very 
similar fit to the correlation with a. The p value of correlation with a for MnP 
oxidation was the largest (Table 2.5). 
Plotting log activity versus the sum of 6 substituent constants for oxidation of 
phenolic azo dyes by HRP is shown in Figure 2.4A and Table 2.6; regression on 
these data yielded: 
log activity = -0.79(+ 0.16)~ + 2.57(+ 0.58) (2 -2) 
where n = 23, s = 0.38, r = 0.74. The rate of azo dye oxidation by HRP decreased 
as a function of 6. A negative slope (-p) indicates that electron-donating substituents 
(-a) enhance the oxidation of dye, and electron-withdrawing substituents (+a) 
decrease oxidation rates. However, the low p and r values (p = -0.79 and r = 0.74) 
indicate that this correlation is relatively poor. This finding suggests that the reaction 
might be controlled by other factors such as steric hindrance. For example, the c 
substituent constants for 3-methyl- and 2-chloro-substituted dyes are -0.07 and 0.27, 
respectively, but both of these dyes essentially exhibited the same level of activity 
(Table 2.1). Similarly, 2,3-dichloro-substituted dye with a 6 value of 0.64 exhibited 
higher activity (405 pmol min-' mg-') than 2,6-dimethyl-subsituted dye (5.4 pmol 
mid mg-') with a r value of -0.32. 
Plotting log activity versus the sum of cr substituent constants for oxidation of 
phenolic azo dyes by MnP is shown in Figure 2.4B and Table 2.6; regression on 
these data yielded: 
log activity = -5.04(f 0.55)~ + 0.36(+ 1.19) (2.3) 
where n = 17, s = 0.48, r = 0.92. As was observed in the HRP correlation, a 
negative slope (-p) between the rate of dye oxidation by MnP and 6 was observed. 
The p and r values (p = -5.04 and r = 0.92), which are comparable to results 
reported by Dunford and coworkers for HRP (Job & Dunford, 1976; Dunford & 
Adeniran, 1986; Hsuanyu & Dunford, 1992), indicate that the correlation is relatively Table 2.4 Representative descriptor variables related to the correlation

0.407 strong, and, therefore, the reaction is predominantly controlled by electronic factors. 
A low a value appears to be a necessary but not a sufficient condition for a dye to 
function as a good substrate for MnP. For example, 2,6-dimethyl- and 2,3,5- 
trimethyl-substituted dyes have very similar cr values (Table 2. I), but their MnP 
oxidation rates were 118 pmol min-' mg-' and 0.3 pmol min-' mg-', respectively. 
Plotting log activity versus the sum of cr substituent constants for oxidation of 
phenolic azo dyes by Lip is shown in Figure 2.4C and Table 2.6; regression on these 
data yielded: 
log activity = -0.12(f 0. ll)~ + 0.13(+ 0.20) (2.4) 
where n = 29, s = 0.20, r = 0.21. Lip activity does not indicate any correlation 
with a substituent constants, possibly because, unlike HW and MnP, Lip is extremely 
weak in azo dye oxidation. 
Based on these correlation results, electronic effects appear to strongly 
influence azo dyes oxidation by MnP and weakly influence HW oxidation. These 
effects might be related to two successive one-electron transfers from azo dye to the 
oxidized heme iron of the enzyme. In the peroxidase catalytic cycle, the native 
enzyme is transformed into two intermediates, compound I and compound 11. These 
intermediates are electron acceptors. Azo dyes serve as electron donors. In azo dye 
oxidation (Figure 2. I), compound I initially oxidizes the hydroxyl group of the 
phenolic ring to a phenoxy radical by a one-electron process and is converted to 
compound 11. In the next step, the phenoxy radical is oxidized by compound I1 to 
produce a carbonium ion, and this electron transfer completes the catalytic cycle. 
Electron-donating groups (negative a values) on the benzene ring may increase the 
electron density on oxygen atoms of active sites, whereas electron-withdrawing groups 
(positive a values) decrease the electron density. Consequently, the rate of reduction 
for compound I and compound I1 could be increased by electron-donating groups on 
the phenolic ring and decreased by electron-withdrawing groups. These results are in 
agreement with the correlation for phenol oxidation by peroxidases as shown in other 
studies (Job & Dunford, 1976; Dunford & Adeniran, 1986; Hsuanyu & Dunford, 
1992). The current findings also suggest that, in addition to electronic effects, steric effects might be important in peroxidase oxidation of azo dyes. The importance of 
the steric effect is dependent on the peroxidase. 
Other molecular descriptors which can affect the electronic charge density at 
the reaction site were used for QSARs (Table 2.4). These molecular descriptors are 
the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (E,,,,), half-wave potential 
(E,,,), and ionization constants (pKa). Generally, these descriptor variables reflect 
properties of substrate molecules in the reaction system. Plots of E,,,,, E,, and pKa 
versus peroxidase activities did not show any correlation (data not shown). CHAPTER 3 
OXIDATION OF AZO DYES BY THE Fenl/H,O, SYSTEM 
3.1 Introduction 
Azo dyes form the largest class of synthetic dyes used in industrial 
applications, constituting more than 50% of all dyes (Zollinger, 1987). It is estimated 
that approximately 10% of the dyes used in dyeing applications are ultimately released 
in waste water (Vaidya & Datye, 1982). Effluents discharged into the environment 
could contain up to 20 % of unutilized dyes (Brown et al., 1981). 
Currently dye waste is treated by several physical, chemical, and biological 
processes (Park & Shore, 1984). In physical processes, traditional methods such as 
adsorption and coagulation are widely used (Riefe, 1992). In the adsorption process, 
dyes bind to activated charcoal through hydrophobic interaction. In the coagulation 
process, calcium or ferric salts are added to the effluent; these metal salts are 
transformed to the corresponding insoluble hydroxides which adsorb the dyes. 
Drawbacks of these methods are that they do not degrade dyes and that it is expensive 
to dispose of the dyes that are absorbed by metal hydroxides and charcoal (Davis et 
al., 1994). 
Chemical processes include chlorination, ozonation, and reduction (Park & 
Shore, 1984; Riefe, 1992; Cha et al., 1996). Chlorination is likely to produce toxic 
chlorinated dyes and their byproducts, which are difficult to biodegrade (Riefe, 1992; 
Davis et al., 1994). Ozone decolorizes dyes by an oxidative mechanism, but is 
limited by its efficiency and cost (Matsui et al., 1981; Park & Shore, 1984). Azo 
dyes can be decolorized using reducing agents such as alkaline dithionate or sodium 
borohydride (Riefe, 1992; Laszlo, 1997). However, a potential problem of this 
method is that the aromatic amines generated are potentially toxic or carcinogenic. Azo dyes can be degraded by biological systems such as bacteria and white-rot 
fungi (Haug et al., 1991; Spadaro et al., 1992). In bacterial systems, azo dye 
degradation is generally initiated by the reductive cleavage of azo linkage under 
aerobic or anaerobic conditions (Walker, 1970; Brown & Laboureur, 1983; Haug et 
al., 1991). Bacterial degradation has been predicted to be economical, but very few 
bacteria which utilize dye as a sole source of carbon have been isolated. In addition, 
bacteria are not known to degrade dyes in a non-specific manner. Pagga and Brown 
(1986) observed that many azo dyes are highly resistant to aerobic bacterial 
degradation. Spadaro et al. (1992) demonstrated that under low nitrogen conditions 
the white-rot basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium can mineralize non- 
sulfonated azo dyes such as Disperse Orange 3, Disperse Yellow 3, N,N- 
dimethylphenylazoaniline, and Solvent Yellow 14 to CO,. Paszczynski et al. (1992) 
demonstrated the mineralization of several sulfonated azo dyes. These oxidative 
systems are not yet suitable for remediating dye effluent. 
Since the biodegradation processes appear to be ineffective, there is a need for 
effective alternative technologies for eliminating dye from effluents. Advanced 
oxidation processes (AOPs), which use hydroxyl radicals ( . OH), might provide useful 
alternatives (Cha et al., 1996; Bahorsky, 1997). In AOP systems, . OH is produced 
using Feil'/ H,O,, UV/O,, UV/H202, or TiO, systems (Walling, 1975; Goldstein et 
al., 1993; Ruppert et al., 1994; Gunten & Olivers, 1997). In particular, AOPs could 
be useful for eliminating non-biodegradable azo dyes (Leung et al., 1992; Legrini et 
al., 1993; Tang & An, 1995). 
AOPs have been demonstrated to remove many hazardous organic pollutants 
(Masten & Davies, 1994; Shu et al., 1994; Hong et al., 1996). The reaction of OH 
with aromatic compounds is very fast and approaches the diffusion-controlled rate 
(Walling, 1975). Kunai et al. (1986) studied the mechanism for benzene degradation 
by Fenton's reagent. The reaction of benzene with . OH resulted in mono- and di- 
hydroxylation of the ring. Several reports also demonstrated similar hydroxylations 
with chlorobenzene (Sedlak & Andren, 1991), dinitrotoluene (Ho, 1986), and 
nitrobenzene (Lipczynska-Kochany, 1991). Continued reaction with . OH results in 
further hydroxylation of phenols and then cleavage of the aromatic ring. Ring cleavage products are further degraded to carboxylic acids and then oxidized to CO,. 
Pignatello (1992) reported that the Fe11'/H202 system can mineralize chlorophenoxy 
herbicides to CO,. 
Many research groups attempted to decolorize azo dyes by AOPs. Dye 
effluents were decolorized by Fenton reagents (Bigda & Elizardo, 1992; Kuo, 1992; 
Solozhenko et al., 1995). Azo dyes were also decolorized by photochemical OH- 
generating systems (Hustert & Zepp, 1992; Dieckrnann & Gray, 1994; Ruppert et al., 
1994; Shu et al., 1994; Tang and An, 1995). However, those studies monitored only 
the loss of color as an indication of dye degradation. Decolorization generally 
demonstrates only the transformation of the chromophoric group of dyes; it does not 
indicate total degradation of the dye (Bigda & Elizardo, 1992). Spadaro et al. (1994) 
demonstrated that azo dyes can be mineralized by Fe1"/H202 system and proposed a 
probable mechanism for azo dye oxidation using 14C-labeled compounds. They 
further demonstrated the formation of benzene from phenylazo-substituted azo dye 
oxidation by - OH. 
In the Fenton system, one-electron reduction of hydrogen peroxide by Fen 
splits H,O, homolytically to generate OH. Feu needed for the subsequent OH 
generation is produced by the reduction of FelI1 by H,O,. FelI can also be generated 
by the one-electron reduction by the hydroperoxy radical.

Fe"' + H202 + Feu + - OOH + H+ (3.2) 
Feu' + -0OH -, Feu + 0, + H+ (3.3) 
This study focuses on the optimization of the Fe1"/H2O2 system for azo dye 
oxidation and the effect of azo dye structures on its degradation by OH. Because 
the textile mill effluents contain various additives such as detergents, inorganic ions, 
and other solvents (Park & Shore, 1984), the effect of such additives on azo dye 
oxidation by the Fe"'/H,O, system was also studied. Quantitative structure-activity 
relationships (QSARs) between phenolic azo dyes and . OH reactivity were examined. 
These QSAR studies might help in predicting the dye substituents preferred in - OH 
degradation and might suggest a probable mechanism. 3.2 Material and Methods 
3.2.1 Chemicals 
Mordant Orange I, Methyl Red, Orange 11, benzalkonium chloride, sodium 
sulfate (Na2S04), sodium iodide (NaI), and all substituted phenols were purchased 
from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI) Orange I was obtained from TCI America (Portland, 
OR). All azo dyes were purchased in high purity and used without any further 
purification. Ferric nitrate (Fe(NO,), 9H20), D-( +)-glucose, [U-14C]aniline, 
hydrogen peroxide (H20,), and HPLC sorbent were obtained from Sigma Chemical 
Company (St. Louis, MO). 
3.2.2 Syntheses of azo dyes 
All azo dyes examined (Table 3.1A and B) contained two benzene rings and 
were synthesized by coupling the diazonium salt of 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid with 
substituted phenols at 0-5°C under alkaline conditions. All azo dyes were purified 
and their structures were confirmed by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry as 
previously described (Chivukula et al., 1995). 
3.2.3 14C-radiolabeled azo dye synthesis 
Initially, I4C-radiolabeled sulfanilic acid was synthesized by reacting 4 p1 of 
I4C-labeled aniline (2 pCi) in 200 pl H20 containing 1 mg of unlabeled aniline with 
50 pl of sulfuric acid (H2S04) for 5 h at 180-190°C. The crude product was then 
purified by HPLC using a C-18 reverse phase column (0.46 x 25 cm; Separations 
Group, Hesperia, CA). The eluent used in HPLC purification was a mixture of 100 
mM phosphate (pH 7.0) and MeOH-H20 (1: 1). Product elution was monitored at 
254 nm. To synthesize 14C-labeled 4-(4'-sulfophenylazo)-2,6-dimethyl-phenol, 1 mg 
of I4C-labeled sulfanilic acid and 3 mg of unlabeled sulfanilic acid were reacted with 
3.2 mg of 2,6-dimethyl phenol, as described above. The crude product was purified 
using the HPLC sorbent for reverse phase chromatography (particle size 40-63 pm). 
A slurry of the HPLC sorbent (1 g) in methanol (5 ml) was loaded onto a small glass

385 water, and the crude product was applied to it. Dye was eluted using methanol, and 
the solvent was removed using nitrogen gas. If needed, the product was further 
purified by HPLC using the same column as described above. The purity of 14C- 
labeled 4-(4'-sulfopheny1azo)-2,6-dimethylphenol was confirmed by HPLC analysis to 
be approximately 99 % . 
3.2.4 Experimental procedures 
All solutions used in this study, including stock solutions of 200 mM ferric 
nitrate salts, were prepared with water from a Milli-Q purification system (Millipore 
Corp., Bedford, MA). All experiments were performed at 25°C. 
3.2.4.1 Estimation of hydroxyl radicals ( . OH). Estimation of OH 
was performed using the deoxyribose assay (Halliwell & Gutteridge, 1981). 
Deoxyribose (3 mM) was reacted with 2 mM Fe(NO,), . 9H20 and H202 (10-100 mM) 
in 2 mM EDTA (pH 7.0) for 10 min. Reaction volume was 1 ml. To that reaction 
mixture were added 1 ml of 1 % (w/v) solution of thiobarbituric acid in 50 mM NaOH 
and 1 ml of 2.8% (wlv) aqueous trichloroacetic acid. This mixture was heated in a 
boiling water bath for 10 min. The absorbance was spectrophotometrically measured 
at 532 nrn using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Model UV-265, Shimadzu 
Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). The concentration of OH was calculated using an 
extinction coefficient of 153 mM-I cm-I (Halliwell & Gutteridge, 1981). 
3.2.4.2 Estimation of hydrogen peroxide (H,O j. H202 was estimated 
using horseradish peroxidase and iodide as its substrate (Cotton & Dunford, 1973). A 
solution of 2 mM Fe(NO,), . 9H20 was reacted with H202 (10-100 mM) for 10 min in 
the presence of 2 mM EDTA (pH 7.0). Reaction volume was 1 ml. An aliquot of 
this mixture was diluted 100 times with 10 mM phosphate (pH 6.0). An aliquot (100 
p1) of diluted reaction mixture was reacted with 10 pg of horseradish peroxidase and 
10 mM NaI for 5 min in the presence of 10 mM phosphate (pH 6.0) in the dark. 
Total reaction volume was 1 ml. Triiodide formation was spectrophotometrically 
measured at 355 nm (Cotton & Dunford, 1973). An extinction coefficient of 255 
mM-' cm-' was used for calculation of the H202 concentration. 3.2.4.3 Decolorization of azo dyes by the F81r/H202 system. The Fe"' 
solution (2 mM) was mixed with 2 mM EDTA (pH 7.0). Two minutes after the 
addition of EDTA, azo dye (200 pM) and H202 were added. Except for 4- 
hydroxyazobenzene, reaction time for other reactions was 10 min. The amount of 
dye decolorized in that time was monitored by following the decrease in absorbance at 
the A,, for each dye. 
The effect of additives on azo dye oxidation was studied by following the 
oxidation of Orange 11, as described above, in the presence of NaBr (20 mM), 
phosphate (20 mM), NaCl (20 mM), Na2S0, (20 mM), glucose (1 mM), Tween 80 
(0.1 %), MeOH (10 pl), chloroform (10 pl), or benzalkonium chloride (1 mg). The 
effect of KNO, at various levels on Orange I1 oxidation was performed at pH 7.0 and 
pH 2.5 in the presence or absence of EDTA. 
Products of Orange I1 oxidation were analyzed by HPLC and gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The column and eluent used for 
HPLC analysis are described in Section 2.3. In GC-MS analysis, the reaction 
mixture of 6hydroxyazobenzene was reduced with sodium dithionite. The reduction 
product was extracted with ethyl acetate, purified using HPLC, acetylated with 
pyridine and acetic anhydride (1:2), and then analyzed by GC-MS. GC-MS analyses 
were carried out at 70 eV on a VG Analytical 7070E mass spectrometer fitted with an 
HP 5790A GC and a fused capillary column (15 m, DB-5, J & W Scientific, Folsom, 
CA). A temperature gradient was used in the GC separation. The initial temperature 
was 70°C, and it was increased to 320°C at a rate of 10°Clmin. 
3.2.4.4 Correlation analysis. A11 charge densities of phenol and 
phenolate were calculated on AM 1 optimized geometry of each dye using the CAChe 
computer program of Oxford Molecular (Beaverton, OR). Atomic charges on all 
atoms except hydrogen atoms, sulfonated benzene rings, and azo linkages were 
determined, and then charge densities of phenol and phenolate were calculated by 
multiple linear regressions using CAChe program (Griiber & Bub, 1989). 
3.2.4.5 Mineralization of 14C-labeled 4-(4'-sulfophenylazo)-2,6- 
dimethylphenol. The radiolabeled dye (60,000 cpm, 200 pM) was mixed with 
Fel"/EDTA (2 mM), KNO, (20 mM), and H,O, (10 mM) (pH 7.0). The reaction 55 
flask was sealed with a rubber cap and Parafilm. Samples were reacted for 4, 8, 12, 
and 24 h. At the end of the reaction times, the gas phase was purged with 0, in , 
order to displace any 14C02 generated in the reaction. 14C0, was collected by 
bubbling the displaced 0, through a basic scintillation fluid (Kirk et al., 1978) and 
quantitated using a liquid scintillation spectrometer (Beckman LS-6500). 
3.3 Results and Discussion 
3.3.1 Effect of azo dye structures 
Degradation of 32 different azo dyes by the FeH1/H202 system was studied to 
understand the selectivity of OH in azo dye oxidation. QSAR studies were 
performed to understand the mechanism of azo dye oxidation. Except for Orange I 
and Orange 11, all other azo dyes were phenolic dyes in which the phenolic ring was 
substituted with methyl, methoxy, chloro, fluoro, bromo, or iodo substituents as 
shown in Figure 3.1. The experimental conditions and oxidation data are summarized 
in Table 3.1A, B, and C. 
All azo dyes tested were oxidized by the FeH1/H,02 system. The position of 
mono-methyl substitution in the phenolic ring indicated only a minimal effect on dye 
oxidation. For example, amounts of oxidation of 2-methyl and 3-methyl substituted 
dyes were 30 and 25%, respectively. For the methoxy and chloro substituents, the 2- 
position was preferred over the 3-position. The number and position of methyl 
substitutions generally had only a limited effect on -OH degradation. Introduction of 
one or two halogens into the phenolic ring enhanced the rate of decolorization. For 
example, amounts of oxidation of 2-chloro and 2,3-dichloro substituted dyes were 95 
and 91 % , respectively. Oxidation of Orange I was the fastest among azo dyes tested, 
whereas that of 4-hydroxyazobenzene (a hydrophobic dye) was the slowest. Oxidation 
of 2-(4'-sulfopheny1azo)-phenol dyes was slower than that of 4-(4'-sulfopheny1azo)- 
phenol dyes. 
The charge density on the phenolate oxygen, protonated or deprotonated, is 
affected by the nature, number, and position of substituents. Since . OH did not show 
any correlation with the Hammett constants, correlation with charge density on the Orange I1 Orange I Methyl Red

regressions using the CAChe program. 
A correlation was found between the amount of dye decolorized and the charge 
density of the phenolate anion species of the dye (Figure 3.2A and Table 3.2). A 
similar correlation was not observed with the charge density of the protonated form 
(Figure 3.2B and Table 3.2). Correction with the fraction of total phenol did not 
improve correlations. This correlation between the charge density on the phenolate 
anion and the rate of OH oxidation of dyes suggested that dye oxidation is initiated 
by OH attack on the phenolate anion. 
3.3.2 Product analysis and probable mechanism 
Products of Orange I1 and 4-hydroxyazobenzene oxidation by . OH were 
analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS. In HPLC analysis, Orange I1 oxidation products 
corresponded to 4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid (t, = 4.4 min) and 1,2- 
naphthoquinone (t, = 22.3 min) (Figure 3.3). Prior to GC-MS analysis, quinones 
were reduced and acetylated. One of the products from 4-hydroxyazobenzene was 
identified as the diacetoxy derivative of 1,4-benzoquinone. The mass spectrum of the 
4-hydroxyazobenzene oxidation product corresponded to 1,4-benzoquinone. MS 
(mlz): 152 (19%); 135 (34%); 110 (85%); 93 (100%) (Figure 3.4). 
Based on these analyses (Figures 3.3 and 3.4) and the QSAR study (Figure 
3.2A), a possible mechanism of Orange I1 oxidation is proposed (Figure 3.5). The 
proposed mechanism resembles peroxidase oxidation of azo dyes (Spadaro & 
Renganathan, 1994). In this mechanism, OH initially removes an electron from the 
phenolate anion to produce the corresponding radical. Then another OH adds to the 
C-1 carbon of the naphthol ring, generating an unstable tetrahedral intermediate which 
breaks down to produce 1,2-naphthoquinone and 4-sulfophenyldiazene. One-electron 
oxidation of 4-sulfophenyldiazene (an unstable intermediate) by 0, yields a 4- 
sulfophenyldiazene radical. Since the latter radical is an unstable intermediate, it 
cleaves homolytically to produce a 4-sulfophenyl radical and a nitrogen molecule. An 
addition of - OH to the 4-sulfophenyl radical might generate 4- 
hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid. Further degradation of 1 ,2-naphthoquinone and 4- 
hydroxybenzenesuIfonic acid by - OH and 0, could lead to aromatic ring degradation. I Charge density of phenolate oxygen

3.3.3 Effect of H202 concentrations on azo dye oxidation 
In order to investigate the relationship between azo dye oxidation and H202 
concentration, oxidation of Orange I1 dye was carried out at various H202 
concentrations. The fraction of the remaining dye ([C]/[C,]) was plotted against 
[H20J (Figure 3.6). Dye oxidation increased with increasing H202 concentration, and 
its oxidation was almost complete at 50 mM H202. 
3.3.4 Estimations of OH generation and H20, decomposition 
This study was performed to determine the optimal condition between . OH 
generation and H202 decomposition in the Fel''/ H202 system. The amount of . OH 
generated increased with the hydrogen peroxide concentration. No increase in . OH 
generation was observed above 80 mM (Figure 3.7). However, H202 decomposition 
increased sharply above 70 mM H202 (Figure 3.8). The amount of H202 consumed 
ranged from 4 to 20 mM. Increased decomposition of H202 might be due to OH 
scavenging by H202. This competing reaction is described in equation 3.4 (Walling 
& Kato, 1971). 
. OH + H202 + H20 + OOH (3.4) 
Such a reaction will decrease . OH generation (40-140 pM) and increase H202 
decomposition or consumption (Figure 3.7 and Figure 3.8). Thus, in the presence of 
high levels of H,O,, - OH might be consumed by reaction with H202 rather than with 
the azo dyes. 
3.3.5 Effect of additives on azo dye oxidation 
Additives such as inorganic anions, detergents, sugar, or organic solvents are 
added during application of dyes. These additives are also released into the 
environment along with dyes. Hence, it is necessary to understand the effect of these 
additives on azo dye degradation by the Fenton system. Here, the effect of additives 
on Fenton degradation of azo dyes was tested using Orange I1 as the model dye. 
Additives tested included sodium sulfate, potassium phosphate, sodium chloride, 
sodium bromide, glucose, methanol, chloroform, benzalkonium chloride, and Tween 
80 (Table 3.3). Figure 3.7 Estimation of hydroxyl radical concentrations. Reaction conditions: 
[Deoxyribose] = 3 mM, [Fe"'] = 2 mM, [H,02] = 10-100 mM, EDTA = 2 mM 
(pH 7.0), and reaction time = 10 min at 25°C. Figure 3.8 H,02 consumption in Fendon's reaction. Reactions conditions: [H,02] = 
10-100 mM, Fe"' = 2 mM, EDTA = 2 mM (pH 7.0)' and reaction time = 10 min 
at 25°C. Chloride, bromide, and phosphate significantly affected azo dye oxidation by 
the Fe"'/H202 system (Table 3.3). Halides can affect dye oxidation by two different 
methods. They can react with OH and thus make OH unavailable for reaction with 
azo dyes. Halides react with OH at the diffusion-controlled rate as described in 
equation 3.5 (Jayson et al., 1973). Secondly, halides can complex with iron (FeC12+, 
FeC12+) and thus reduce the reactivity of iron with H202 (Pignatello, 1992). 
- OH + Cl- + H20 + C1- (3.5) 
Phosphate could affect OH generation by precipitating iron from the solution 
which needs to be in solution for OH generation. Sulfate did not affect azo dye 
oxidation, probably because it does not react with . OH and does not form a strong 
complex with iron. 
Generally, nitrate ion (NO,-) is one of the common inorganic anions in textile 
effluents. KNO, (20 mM) added to the reaction mixture enhanced Orange I1 
oxidation by 49 % in 10 min in the presence of 2 mM EDTA (pH 2.5) (Figure 3.9A), 
and by 26% in 5 min in the absence of EDTA (pH 2.5) (Figure 3.9B). Orange I1 
oxidation in the presence of 2 rnM EDTA (pH 7.0) indicated a linear relationship, 
showing that Orange I1 disappearance is accelerated with increasing nitrate 
concentration (Figure 3.10). Oxidation of 4(4'-sulfopheny1azo)-2,6-dimethylphenol 
was also increased in the presence of nitrate anion (Figure 3.1 1). However, 
mineralization of 14C-labeled 4-(4'-sulfopheny1azo)-2,6-dimethyl-phenol by the 
Fe"'lH202 system was not affected by the addition of nitrate anion (Figure 3.12). 
GC-MS analyses of 4-hydroxyazobenzene products generated in the presence of 
nitrate ion showed that introduction of nitro-substitution on the aromatic benzene ring 
had not occurred (data not shown). The mechanism by which nitrate enhances dye 
decolorization is not understood. 
Detergents such as benzalkonium chloride (cationic detergent) and Tween-80 
(nonionic detergent) significantly decreased azo dye oxidation possibly by competing 
for OH (Table 3.3). Other organic pollutants such as alcohol, glucose, and organic 
solvents might reduce dye oxidation by competing for OH (Haag & Yao, 1992). 
In summary, a correlation was observed between the amount of dye oxidized 
by the FeU'/H2O2 system and the charge density on the phenolate ion. This suggests Table 3.3 Effect of additives on Orange I1 decolorization

that the initial reaction of OH is with the deprotonated dye. The Fe1'I/H2O2 system 
prefers 4-(4'-sulfopheny1azo)-phenol derivatives over 2-(4'-sulfopheny1azo)-phenol 
derivatives. Generation of OH increased linearly with increasing initial H202 
concentration. However, OH generation at higher initial [H20,] is hindered, 
possibly due to OH scavenging by H202. Halides reduce dye decolorization perhaps 
by reacting with . OH. Phosphate could retard dye decolorization by precipitating 
iron from solution. Surprisingly, nitrate enhances decolorization marginally, but it 
does not seem to have any effect on the mineralization of azo dye to CO,. CHAPTER 4 
NON-ENZYMATIC REDUCTION OF AZO DYES BY NADH 
4.1 Introduction 
Synthetic azo dyes are highly resistant to aerobic bacterial degradation 
(Zimmerman et al., 1982; Kulla et al., 1983; Idaka et al., 1987; Shaul et al., 1991). 
However, they can be reduced by chemical and biological processes. In chemical 
processes, azo dye reduction is primarily achieved by the cleavage of azo linkage 
using reducing agents such as sodium hydrosulfite, sodium dithionate, or FeO (Riefe, 
1992). Particularly, sodium hydrosulfite and sodium dithionate are powerful reducing 
agents under alkaline conditions (Riefe, 1992). Azo dyes such as Disperse Blue 79 
and 4-aminoazobenzene are reduced by Fe"/Fel" and FeO redox systems (Weber & 
Adams, 1995; Weber, 1996). Azo linkage reduction by bacteria under aerobic as 
well as anaerobic conditions is known (Haug et al., 1991; Brown & DeVito, 1993). 
Azo dye reduction under anaerobic conditions is catalyzed by anaerobic bacteria, 
present in sludge, sediment, and mammalian intestines (Rafii et al., 1990; Brown & 
DeVito, 1993). The aromatic mines produced under anaerobic conditions could be 
further degraded by aerobic bacteria (Huang et al., 1979; Brown & Laboureur, 1983; 
Rafii et al., 1990; Haug et al., 1991; Chung & Cerniglia, 1992). Haug et al. (1991) 
demonstrated that a mixture of two separate aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures, 
when allowed to pass through successive anaerobic and aerobic conditions, can 
mineralize azo dyes to CO,. In that study, anaerobic cleavage of azo linkage 
occurred first, followed by aerobic degradation of reduction products. It was also 
observed that azo dye degradation by Pseudomonas sp. was initiated by the reductive 
cleavage of azo-linkage under anaerobic conditions, producing two aryl mine 
products (Zirnrnerman et al., 1982). Donlon et al. (1997) demonstrated that methanogenic consortia can partially mineralize Mordant Orange I to CO, under 
anaerobic conditions. 
In mammals, azo dye reduction by azo reductases occurs in the liver and in the 
intestinal microflora (Scheline et al., 1970; Walker et al., 1971; Zimmerman et al., 
1982; Idaka et al., 1987). Several azo dyes are reduced to corresponding aryl amines 
by cytochrome P-450 and by a flavin-dependent liver cytosolic reductase (Huang et 
al., 1979; Rafii et al., 1990). Water-soluble azo dyes are primarily reduced to 
corresponding aryl amines by azo reductases in the intestinal microflora (Brown & 
DeVito, 1993). Partially soluble mine products might be absorbed by the intestinal 
lining. These enzymes require cofactors such as NADPH, FMN, or FAD (Idaka et 
al., 1987). 
Wuhrmann et al. (1980) observed that reduced intracellular flavin nucleotides 
can non-enzymatically reduce azo dyes. Fujita and Peisach (1982) demonstrated that 
amaranth azo dye is non-enzymatically reduced by photochemically prepared FADH,. 
In this process, two FADH, are oxidized for every one molecule of dye reduced 
(Fujita & Peisach, 1982). The reductive cleavage of azo linkage by reduced flavins 
was due to direct non-enzymatic reduction (Mallett et al., 1982). In addition, 
NADPH can reduce 4-aminoazobenzene non-enzymatically in the bacterial 
homogenate system, and the reduction increases with increasing NADPH 
concentration (Idaka et al., 1987). 
In our search for an Orange I1 azo reductase from Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium, we observed that boiled intracellular extracts can reduce Orange I1 in 
the presence of NADH. This observation suggested that azo dyes can be non- 
enzymatically reduced by NAD(P)H (Nam & Renganathan, unpublished results). 
Here, NADH reduction of azo dyes is investigated in detail. The kinetics, 
mechanism, NADH selectivity for dyes, and products of dye reduction are examined. 4.2 Materials and Methods

4.2.2 Syntheses of azo dyes 
All 4-(4'-su1fophenylazo)-phenol and 2-(4'sulfophenylazo)-phenol azo dyes

4.2.3 Reduction of azo dye with NADH 
An azo dye (50 pM) and NADH (1 mM) were mixed in 20 mM succinate (pH

Orange I (50 pM) and NADH (10 mM) were mixed in 20 mM succinate (pH 
3.5) at 25 "C. Dye reduction was monitored by following the decrease in absorbance 
at 476 nm. 
4.2.7 Analytical methods 
The reduction of azo dyes was quantitated by monitoring the decrease in 
absorbance at the maximum wavelength for each azo dye with a UV-visible 
spectrophotometer (Model UV-265, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). Dye 
reduction and product formation were also quantitated using HPLC. A C-18 reverse 
phase column described in Chapter 3 was used. The reductive products were eluted 
with a gradient containing 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and a mixture of 
deionized water and methanol (1: 1). The reaction mixture was monitored at 254 nm 
using a UV-visible detector. The flow rate of eluent was 1 mllmin. Initially, the 
phosphate buffer concentration was maintained at 100% for 5 min. Then the 
water-methanol mixture was increased from 0 to 100% over 10 min and maintained 
at 100 % concentration for an additional 10 min. For gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (GC-MS), the reduction product was extracted with ethyl acetate, 
purified using HPLC, and acetylated with pyridine and acetic anhydride (1:2). 
Analyses were carried out as described in Chapter 3. 
4.3 Results and Discussion 
The white-rot fungus P. chrysosporium completely oxidizes azo dyes to CO, 
(Spadaro et al., 1992). It is possible that this degradation is initiated by the reduction 
of azo linkage. To further understand this process, reduction of Orange I1 by 
intracellular extracts of P. chrysosporium was tested. Surprisingly, control 
experiments which contained either no enzyme or heat-inactivated enzyme showed 
high levels of azo dye reduction in the presence of NAD(P)H. This suggested that 
azo dyes can be non-enzymatically reduced by NAD(P)H. 4.3.1 pH effect on azo dye reduction 
To evaluate pH effects on azo dye, Orange I reduction was examined at 
different pH values. Orange I was reduced up to 63 % by 0.8 mM NADH in the pH 
range of 3.5 to 8.0 during a 15-min reaction (Figure 4.1). Reduction of Orange I 
was measured only in the pH range of 3.5 to 6.0, and maximum reduction was 
determined at the lowest pH. 
Wuhrmann et al. (1980) observed a similar pH dependence on azo dye 
reduction by reduced flavin nucleotide. Reduction of azobenzene to aniline by abiotic 
reduction of an anaerobic sediment was also a pH-dependent process (Weber & 
Wolfe, 1987). The low pH optimum for azo dye reduction indicates the requirement 
for protons in the reductive process. 
4.3.2 Effect of NADH levels on azo dye reduction 
A series of Orange I reductions was performed at different NADH 
concentrations (0.3-1.5 mM) under identical experimental conditions at pH 4.0. The 
amount of azo dye reduced increased with increasing NADH concentration (Figure 
4.2). These results are in agreement with second-order kinetics, indicating that the 
rate of disappearance of a reactant increases with the increasing concentration of 
another reactant. 
4.3.3 Product analysis 
The products of Orange I and 4-hydroxyazobenzene reduction by NADH were 
analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS. HPLC analysis showed that the reduction of Orange 
I via cleavage of the azo linkage generates 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid (t, = 4.0 
min) (Figure 4.3B). P-Aminonaphthol, the second product of Orange I1 reduction, 
was not found because that product was unstable. Prior to GC-MS analysis, the 
reduction product was acetylated. The mass spectra of the acetylated 4- 
hydroxyazobenzene reduction product indicated the presence of an aniline derivative. 
Thus, the reduction product was identified as an aniline. MS (mlz): 135 (30%); 93 
(100%); 77 (8%) (Figure 4.4). These findings suggest that NADH can reduce azo 
dyes by four electrons to generate two aromatic mines.

with pyridine and acetic anhydride (1:2). This product was identified as aniline. 4.3.4 Kinetics of azo dye reduction 
The rate of disappearance of a reactant in a second-order reaction is described 
by equation 4.2 in which A and B are the two reactants. 
d[A] / dt = -k[A] [B] (4.2) 
If the concentration of reactant B is in great excess with respect to reactant A, the rate 
law might be approximated by a pseudo first-order rate law assuming a constant 
concentration of B (Morris, 1990) as in equation 4.3: 
d[A] / dt = -kb,[A] (4.3) 
where k is the second-order constant, t is time, and k,,,,, (k,,,, = k[B]) indicates the 
observed pseudo first-order rate constant. 
The non-enzymatic reduction of Orange I by NADH was used as a model for 
the kinetic study. In this study, the initial concentration of dye was 50 pM, and that 
of NADH was 10 mM. The concentration of dye decreased with respect to time as 
shown in Figure 4.5. The plot of log [Dye] / [Dye], versus time was linear (Figure 
4.6). Therefore, in this system, the disappearance of Orange I is characterized as a 
pseudo-first order reaction with respect to the dye concentration. kb, was 0.110 + 
0.004 min-' (n = 5, s = 0.020, r;? = 0.997). However, at low concentrations of 
NADH, this kinetic reaction might change to a true second-order overall, first-order 
with respect to azo dye and NADH. Since b,, is equal to k[B] (equation 4.3), the 
second-order rate constant (k) in this system can be approximated as 0.183 + 0.007 
M-1 s-l 
4.3.5 Proposed mechanism for azo dye reduction by NADH 
Azo dye reduction occurred only under acidic conditions, indicating that dye 
reduction increased with decreasing pH. This suggests two probable pathways for azo 
dye reduction (Figure 4.7). Initially, a hydride of NADH may be added to nitrogen 
that is connected to the sulfonated benzene ring. This nitrogen is expected to be 
electron-deficient, because it is linked to a sulfophenyl group. Addition of a proton to 
the negatively charged nitrogen would create a hydrazo intermediate. Addition of one 
more hydride and one more proton would lead to cleavage of N-N bond to produce 
two aromatic mines. The second pathway involves initial protonation of the azo Figure 4.5 The reduction of Orange I by NADH. Reaction conditions: [Dye], = 50

Alternatively, reduction might be initiated by proton addition to the azo linkage 
followed by a hydride transfer from NAD(P)H. 
4.3.6 Effect of dye structures on azo dye reduction 
To further understand the reductive process, reduction of Orange I, Orange 11, 
4-hydroxyazobenzene, Allura Red, and Sunset Yellow FCF was examined. Allura 
Red and Sunset Yellow FCF are used in foods. With the exception of 4- 
hydroxyazobenzene, all other dyes are naphthol-based dyes with one or two sulfonic 
acid groups. The amount of dye decolorized ranged from 31 to 93 % (Table 4.1C). 
This suggested that there is some selectivity in the reduction of azo dyes by 
NAD(P)H. To further understand this selectivity, reduction of a variety of 4-(4'- 
sulfopheny1azo)-phenol and 2-(4'-sulfopheny1azo)-phenol dyes was examined. All 
substituent alterations were made only in the phenolic ring of azo dyes. The 
percentage of decolorization of these dyes at pH 3.5 in the presence of 1 mM NADH 
is presented in Table 4.1A and B. Structures of dyes studied are shown in Figure 
4.8. 
Among the mono-substituted dyes examined, all dyes except the 3-nitro 
substituted dye were reduced. In general, 3-substituted dyes appeared to be preferred 
over 2-substituted dyes. Introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents such as 
halogens in the 2-position decreased azo dye reduction. Introduction of halogens in 
the 3-position enhanced azo dye reduction. Introduction of di-methyl substitution in 
the 2,3-position or tri-methyl in the 2,3,6-position lead to complete reduction of those 
azo dyes. In general, introduction of an identical second substituent did not appear to 
significantly affect reduction. However, the 2,3-difluoro analog was an exception to 
this observation, in which reduction actually decreased compared to 2- or 3-fluoro 
substituted azo dye. 
Substrate selectivity study favors the mechanism involving initial hydride 
transfer. Any substituent that decreases the electron density of azo linkage should 
increase the rate of hydride transfer; in contrast, a substituent which increases the 
electron density of azo linkage will retard hydride transfer. For example, a strong Orange I 89

so, 
Figure 4.8 Structures of axo dyes. electron-withdrawing substituent such as a halogen will make the phenol more acidic 
and lower its pKa. When pKa is low, the phenoxide form will predominate. The 
phenoxide via resonance can enrich the electron density of the azo linkage. This 
should reduce the rate of azo reduction. In accordance with this argument, 2-halogen 
substituted dyes are reduced at a slower rate compared to unsubstituted dyes. 
However, introduction of a 3-halogen substituent increases azo dye reduction. This 
might be because a 3-halogen substituent can withdraw electron density from the azo 
linkage by inductive effects. In addition to electronic effects, steric effects might also 
be important. Reduction of 2,3,5- and 2,3,6-trimethyl exemplifies this effect. 
Reduction of the 2,3,5-trimethyl analog is at least 10-fold lower than that of the 
2,3,6-trimethyl analog. Since the electronic nature of the two analogs is expected to 
be similar, the observed differences are most probably due to steric effects. 
The amount of reduction of 2-(4'-sulfopheny1azo)-phenol dyes is comparable to 
that of 4-(4'-sulfopheny1azo)-phenol dyes. 2-(4'-Sulfopheny1azo)-phenol dyes are 
oxidized very slowly by peroxidases and the FeU'/H2O2 system only, compared to 4- 
(4'-sulfopheny1azo)-phenol dyes (see Chapters 2 and 3). This suggests that the former 
class of dyes is more susceptible to reduction than oxidation. 
In summary, this study suggests that all the dyes tested, except the 3-nitro 
substituted dye, can be non-enzymatically reduced by NADH. Introduction of methyl 
and methoxy substituents into the 2-, 2,3-, 2,6-, or 2,3,6-position of the aromatic ring 
accelerates the reduction of phenolic azo dyes by NADH, compared to that of 
unsubstituted dye. In addition, halogenation on the 3-position renders phenolic azo 
dyes more susceptible to reduction than halogenation on the 2-position. The position 
of the azo linkage with respect to the hydroxyl group does not significantly influence 
the reduction of phenolic azo dyes. 
Azo dye reduction by NADH has certain implications on the mammalian 
metabolism and degradation of azo dyes. In mammalian metabolism, sulfonated 
water-soluble azo dyes such as food dyes are primarily reduced only by intestinal 
anaerobic bacteria, and no reduction occurs in the mammalian liver (Brown & 
DeVito, 1993). The aromatic arnine metabolites are suggested to be excreted from 
the body. However, this study suggests that non-enzymatic reduction might occur in the stomach, where the environment is maintained in the pH range of 1.0 to 1.5 
(Brady, 1990) and possibly from food sources when NAD(P)H is available. 
One of the reasons bacteria are unable to oxidize azo dyes readily is attributed 
to the azo linkage, which does not occur in nature. However, aerobic bacteria can 
degrade aromatic amines. Thus, non-enzymatic reduction of azo dyes to amines could 
facilitate further degradation by bacteria. For example, sulfanilic acid, which could 
be formed from the reduction of a variety of azo dyes, can be degraded by an 
activated sludge (Brown & Hamburger, 1987). Hammer et al. (1996) also 
demonstrated that a mixed bacterial culture of Hydrogenophaga palleronii strain S1 
and Agrobacterium radiobacter strain S2 can degrade sulfanilic acid. A drawback of 
this reduction is that it could also generate potentially carcinogenic aromatic amines. CHAPTER 5 
KINETICS OF AZO DYE REDUCTION BY ZERO-VALENT IRON 
5.1 Introduction 
Reduction of azo dyes can occur in biological, chemical, and photochemical 
systems. Some bacteria can reduce the azo linkages of azo dyes under both aerobic 
and anaerobic conditions (Chung & Stevens, 1992; Brown & DeVito, 1993). In 
mammals, the azo linkages of azo dyes are reduced by azo reductases in intestinal 
microflora and liver (Huang et al., 1979; Rafii et al., 1990; Chung & Cerniglia, 
1992). Reduction of azo dyes appears to be mediated by a chemical redox process in 
anaerobic sediments at the bottom of stagnant or brackish waterways (Weber & 
Wolfe, 1987; Weber & Adams, 1995). Though the aromatic arnine products 
generated by the dye reduction are toxic to mammals, they are more susceptible to 
biodegradation compared to the parent dye compounds (Zollinger, 1987). 
Recently the remediation of contaminants by granular iron metal has been 
extensively studied. Zero-valent iron (FeO) is a mild reductant, which is readily 
oxidized to ferrous iron (Tratnyek, 1996). The direct role of FeO as a reducing agent 
implies the involvement of reactive sites on the metal surface (Matheson & Tratnyek, 
1994). The area and condition of the FeO surface strongly affect the rate of reduction 
of organic pollutants including chlorinated aliphatics and nitro aromatics. The 
mechanism of these reactions appears to be electrochemical. Oxidation of FeO to Fe" 
could be the anodic reaction at the interface between FeO and H,O, and the reduction 
of compounds from solution could be the cathodic reaction (Agrawal & Tratnyek, 
1996). The cathodic reaction varies with the reactivity of available electron 
acceptors. In pure anoxic aqueous systems, the acceptors include H+ and H,O, which 
yield OH- and H,: 93 
FeO + 2H+ c. Fe+, + H, (5.1) 
FeO + 2H20 + Fe+2 + H, + 20H- (5.2) 
In oxic aqueous systems, 0, is the preferred electron acceptor at the cathodic site: 
2Fe0 + 0, + 2H20 -. 2Fe+, + 40H- (5.3) 
Other strong electron acceptors (oxidants), both inorganic and organic, may 
offer additional cathodic reactions that contribute to iron corrosion (Agrawal & 
Tratnyek, 1996). For example, a recent study showed that the reduction of 4- 
aminoazobenzene by FeO in an aqueous system resulted from a reaction mechanism 
involving a surfaced-mediated process (Weber , 1996). Hydrogen peroxide (H,O,) 
also reacts readily with FeO at low pH (Tang & Chen, 1996). In this system, FeO is 
oxidized to Fef2, which subsequently produces hydroxyl radicals via Fenton reaction. 
In this study, we investigated the reduction of azo dyes by zero-valent iron 
metal in HEPES [N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-piperazine-N'-(2-ethanesulfonic acid)] buffer. 
The objective was to characterize the kinetics of azo dye reduction by FeO. The 
findings in this study should help assess the possible use of FeO in waste water 
treatment technologies for azo dyes. 
5.2 Materials and Methods 
5.2.1 Chemicals 
Food dyes such as Allura Red (FD&C Red # 40), Tartrazine (FD&C Yellow # 
5), Brilliant Blue FCF (FD&C Blue # I), and Sunset Yellow FCF (FD&C Yellow #6) 
were obtained from Warner Jenkinson (St. Louis, MO). Orange I was purchased 
from TCI America (Portland, OR). Amaranth, Naphthol Blue Black, Crocein Orange 
G, Orange 11, and Acid Blue 113 were obtained from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). The 
dyes and their structures are summarized in Table 5.1 and Figure 5.1. All dyes were 
purchased in the highest purity that was commercially available and used as received 
without further purification. Zero-valent iron filings ( > 99.9 % , Fluka, Cat. No. 
44905) were sieved to obtain the 16-32 mesh size grains and then used without any 
further treatment. The surface area of this iron was 1.42 m2 L-', as determined by 
BET gas adsorption with krypton (Johnson et al., 1996). Table 5.1 Dyes used and their physical properties

Figure 5.1 Dye structures. 5.2.2 Batch system 
All experiments were buffered with HEPES (pH 7.0, 10 mM) from Sigma. 
Buffer was prepared with deionized and deoxygenated water. All dye reduction 
kinetics were determined in 7-ml scintillation vials containing 1.000 + 0.002 g FeO, 
resulting in a surface area concentration pa = 1.42 m2 L-'. In an anaerobic glove 
box, dye solutions of 60 pM, 300 pM, and 3 mM were combined with HEPES buffer 
and sealed with Teflon-lined caps and Parafilm. The final reaction volume was 5 ml. 
Reaction was performed by shaking the iron filings with the dye solution on an orbital 
shaker at room temperature. The solution phase was routinely sampled at specified 
time intervals, and the amount of dye remaining was determined using a 
spectrophotometer. 
5.2.3 Analytical methods 
Samples were diluted 2-10 times with deionized water to obtain 
spectrophotometrically measurable absorbances. Decolorization of each dye was 
quantitated by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at the A, (Table 5.1) for each 
dye using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Model UV-265, Shimadzu Corporation, 
Kyoto, Japan). In the experiments with textile waste water, decolorization was 
followed by collecting absorbance spectra from 350 to 700 nm at specified time 
intervals. 
5.3 Results and Discussion 
5.3.1 Characterization of reduction products 
FeO decolorized Orange I1 and produced sulfanilic acid (HPLC retention time 
3.8 min) from Orange I1 (Figure 5.2). The color of Orange I1 (A, = 484 nm) 
disappeared completely in 6 min, and was accompanied by the appearance of 
sulfanilic acid. After 6 min, the mass balance between decolorized Orange I1 and 
sulfanilic acid produced approached 90%, suggesting that Orange I1 disappearance 
was due to dye reduction by FeO. P-Aminonaphthol was not analyzed, but is 
presumed to be the other product of cleavage of the azo linkage. Thus, the overall 4 6 
Minutes

and formation of 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid. reaction can be summarized: 
2Fe0 + Orange I1 + 4H+ -. 2Fe+2 + sulfanilic acid + 0-aminonaphthol (5.4) 
Based on HPLC analysis, all other azo dyes tested in this study also produced 
substituted anilines from dye reduction by FeO. 
Our results with Orange I1 are consistent with previously reported results for 
azobenzene reduction (Weber, 1996). Weber reported that the dissolved 4- 
aminoazobenzene (4-AAB) was readily reduced with the formation of aniline which is 
stable in a FeO-H,O system. Reduction of dissolved 4-AAB by FeO resulted in the 
complete loss of 4-AAB in 2 h, which generated the rapid formation of aniline with 
good mass balance (Weber, 1996). 
Azo linkage reduction involves transfer of four electrons from zero-valent 
iron. The reaction might proceed in a stepwise fashion; initially azo dye might be 
transformed into a hydrazo intermediate by the transfer of two electrons, and then azo 
linkage might be further reduced with two electrons to generate a substituted aniline 
(equation 5.5).

5.3.2 Kinetics 
5.3.2.1 Characterization of azo dye reduction. First-order kinetics 
apply when reduction rates decrease linearly with substrate concentration. The first- 
order rate law for the disappearance of a reactant is 
-d[C] / dt = kbs[C] 
which integrates to 
lnCC1 [Col = -kbst (5.7) 
where Co is the initial concentration of reactant, t is time, and kbs indicates the first- 
order rate constant. 
First-order rate constants (kb,) should be characteristic of a particular 
contaminant but not dependent on its concentration (Johnson et al., 1996). In the 
reduction of Orange I1 by FeO, the concentration of dye decreased exponentially with 
respect to time (Figure 5.2) and linearly on a ln[C] / [C,] versus t plot (Figure 5.3). Figure 5.3 C, and C are the Orange I1 concentrations at time 0 and time t, 
respectively. First-order rate constant kb, was determined to be 0.306 f 0.009 
min-' . Thus, the disappearance of the azo dye proceeds by kinetics that are first-order with 
respect to azo dye concentration. 
Reduction with FeO is also dependent on tde amount of iron present, as 
represented in the following model from Johnson et al. (1996): 
-d[C] 1 dt = ksA ag,[C] 
or 
-d[C] 1 dt = ksA pa[C] 
Where ksA = the specific reaction rate constant (L h-' me2), 
a, = the specific surface area of FeO (m2 g-'), 
p, = the mass concentration of FeO (g L-'), and 
pa = the surface area concentration of FeO (m2 L-'). 
The rearrangement of equations 5.6 and 5.9 gives a useful equation: 
kobs = ~SA X Pa (5.10) 
where pa is ag,. In equation 5.10, the specific reaction rate constant (ksA) could be 
determined by the slope of a plot of bb, versus pa. 
Forty experiments for the kinetic study of azo dye reduction were performed 
with pa = 1.42 m2 L-I of Fluka iron turnings. The experimental details and kinetic 
data are summarized in Table 5.2. Most azo dyes were more than 90% reduced in 
about 10 min. In all cases, ln[C] I [C,] versus time plots were linear, as exemplified 
by Figure 5.3. Therefore, rates of azo reduction by zero-valent iron in an anaerobic 
Fe0-H20 system appear to be first-order reactions. Linear regression on Figure 5.3 
gives &,, = 0.306 + 0.009 (n = 5, 9 = 0.997). bbs for a variety of dyes was 
determined using similar linear regression analyses of kinetic data (Table 5.2). 
5.3.2.2 Effect of mixing on kinetics (rpm dependent kinetics). The 
reaction of azo dyes by FeO could proceed by the following steps: (i) initial transport 
of the azo dye from the bulk solution to the iron metal surface, (ii) adsorption of the 
azo dye to the iron surface to generate a surface complex, (iii) reduction of the 
surface complex, (iv) desorption of the products, and (v) mass transport of the 
product to the bulk solution (Spiro, 1989; Sturnrn, 1992). One or more of these steps 
might be slow enough to influence kb, values. Table 5.2 Summary of kinetic data

0.1 16 * 0.038 One common criterion for assessing the contribution of mass transport in 
reaction kinetics is the effect of mixing. Generally, aggressive mixing increases 
diffusion-controlled rates by narrowing the diffusion layer at particle surfaces (Spiro, 
1989). The mixing method used in this study was orbital shaking, so the most 
convenient measure of mixing rate is rpm of the orbital table. Different mixing rates 
were applied to reduction for Crocein Orange G (Figure 5.4A and B). In this series 
of experiments, kbs values and reduction rates at all initial dye concentrations tested 
increased with increasing rpm (Figure 5.4A and B). 
These results are similar to those for reduction of nitrobenzene by FeO 
(Agrawal & Tratnyek, 1996). Nitro reduction rate constants show a linear correlation 
to mixing rates, even though the mixing method applied was 360" rotation around a 
fixed-length axis. In that study, Agrawal & Tratnyek concluded that the reaction rate 
was dominated by mass transport effects. 
Current findings also suggest that mixing velocity directly affects the rate of 
azo dye reduction and that azo dye reduction rates under the experimental conditions 
used are influenced by mass transport. It is possible that kb, might not change at 
higher rprn as the reaction system moves from mass-transport control to diffusion 
control. In addition, mixing rates on bbs values and reaction rates at different initial 
concentrations provide the non-zero intercepts. 
5.3.2.3 Effect of initial concentration on reduction kinetics. 
Reduction of Crocein Orange G at 100 rprn was studied at initial concentrations 
ranging from 60 pM to 3 mM. Rate constants (k,,) increased with decreasing initial 
dye concentrations at the same mixing rate (Figure 5.4A), whereas reaction rates 
indicated a reverse trend (Figure 5.4B). This series of experiments provided evidence 
for deviations from simple first-order kinetics, because k,,, values decreased 45% as 
initial concentration increased (Figure 5.5A). These results are similar to those for 
dechlorination of CCl, by FeO (Johnson et al., 1996). These deviations might be due 
to limited reaction sites at the iron surface. These deviations are often observed in 
heterogeneous systems where the surface and the surface complex affect 
disappearance rates (Scherer & Tratnyek, 1995; Johnson et al., 1996). Square root of rpm

constant for Crocein Orange G reduction. Initial Crocein Orange G concentrations 
are indicated in the insert. Dye in HEPES buffer (pH 7.0, 10 mM) was shaken with 
FeO (16-32 mesh, pa = 1.42 M2 L-l, Fluka) at specified rpm rates on an orbital 
shaker at room temperature.

untreated FeO (16-32 mesh, pa = 1.42 m2 L-', Fluka) in the presence of HEPES 
buffer (pH 7.0, 10 mM) at room temperature. 
Figure 5.5B A plot of rate of Crocein Orange G reduction (mM min-') versus initial 
dye concentration (mM) for the data shown in Figure 5.5A. The curve is from a fit 
to an exponential function. Reduction rates of Crocein Orange G increased with increasing initial dye 
concentration and then leveled out at higher dye concentration, showing a hyperbolic 
curve (Figure 5.5B). Generally, deviations from the kinetic model (equation 5.6) are 
generated through changes in reactivity of the metal surface due to adsorption or other 
reactions on the metal surface (Johnson et al., 1996). In addition, reaction sites on 
the iron surface are limited, so the rate of azo dye reduction increases with increasing 
dye concentration until the saturation of these sites occurs, and then this saturation 
results in these deviations. Heterogeneous systems such as the FeO reduction system 
often exhibit a hyperbolic relationship between the rate of reduction and the initial 
reactant concentration. Scherer et al. (1998) found Michaelis-Menten-type kinetic 
behavior in the reduction of carbon tetrachloride by FeO. A similar behavior was 
observed in the reduction of azo dyes by FeO. At low dye concentration, the rate of 
reduction linearly increased with increasing dye concentration. However, at high 
levels of dye concentration, the rate of reduction did not change with dye 
concentration. 
5.3.3 Effects of azo dye structure on k,,, values 
Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) are powerful tools for 
analysis of properties of many important organic substances in environmental 
chemistry. QSARs provide the possibility of estimating properties that have not been 
previously measured (Tratnyek, 1998). 
In this study, except for Brilliant Blue FCF, all of the dyes tested were azo 
dyes which included one or two azo linkages. All of the dyes contained at least one 
sulfonate group, which makes the dyes water-soluble. Except for Brilliant Blue, all 
of the dyes included one hydroxyl group. The structure of azo dyes (Figure 5.1) 
apparently influences the rate of reduction (Table 5.2). 
Many descriptor variables are available for correlation analysis (Eriksson et 
al., 1993). Typical descriptors for reductive reactions include substituent constants 
(a) and some molecular descriptors such as energy of the lowest unoccupied 
molecular orbital (EL,,,). Substituent constants (a), which indicate electronic effects 
of substituents on the reaction, are used in correlations such as the Harnrnett equation and its various extensions (Tratnyek, 1998). ELUMO refers to the energy gained when 
an electron is added to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). 
In this study, the LUMO energy of each azo dye was calculated in order to 
estimate the potential for azo dye decolorization. The calculation was done with the 
CAChe computer program (Oxford Molecular, Beaverton, OR) after optimizing the 
molecular geometry using MOPAC with PM3 parameters. The properties and 
descriptors of azo dyes used for a QSAR are presented in Table 5.3. 
In this study, regression of kbs versus EL,,, shows a linear correlation with 
some deviations in QSAR (Figure 5.6): 
For 100 rpm, k,,,, = (0.078 f 0.040) x EL,,, + (0.263 f 0.025) (5.1 1) 
where n = 10, s = 0.022, and r = 0.572. 
For 120 rpm, kbs = (0.156 f 0.080) x EL",, + (0.448 f 0.043) (5.12) 
where n = 6, s = 0.035, and r = 0.664. 
For140rpm,~bs=(0.257f0.106)xEL,Mo+(0.681~0.060) (5.13) 
where n = 7, s = 0.044, and r = 0.734. 
In the correlation between kb, and EL,,,, steepness of the slope decreases as 
the rpm is decreased from 140 to 100. b,, values showed a positive correlation with 
EL,,, in all three rpm experiments. This finding suggests that dye reduction could be 
influenced by its reduction potential. 
5.4 Conclusions 
All azo dyes tested were readily reduced by FeO. This reduction followed 
first-order kinetics with respect to initial azo dye concentration. Decolorization rates 
of azo dyes were proportional to the mixing rates, suggesting a dependence on mass 
transport. In addition, the correlation between bs values and EL,,, suggests that the 
reaction could be influenced by azo dye reduction potential. Investigation of the 
effect of initial dye concentration on dye reduction by FeO at fixed rpm suggested a 
hyperbolic relationship between initial dye concentration and the rate of reduction. 
This behavior resembles the Michaelis-Menten kinetics of enzymatic reaction. -1.89 -1.79 -1.69 -1.59 -1.49 -1.39 -1.29 -1.19

FINAL COMMENTS 
Azo dyes constitute more than 50% of all dyes produced in the world 
(Betowski et al., 1987; Zollinger, 1987). It is estimated that 10-15% of the dye 
utilized in the dyeing process is not bound to fabric (Brown et al., 1981), and that 
much of it is apparently released into waste streams (Clarke & Anliker, 1980). 
Currently dye effluents are treated by physical, chemical, and biological methods 
(Park & Shore, 1984). Physical methods, such as adsorption and chemical 
precipitation, do not degrade dyes and require disposal of the dye-adsorbed 
precipitates (Davis et al., 1994). Chemical methods include chlorination, ozonation, 
and reduction. Chlorination might produce toxic chlorinated dyes and their by- 
products (Riefe, 1992; Davis et al., 1994). Ozonation is limited by its efficiency and 
cost (Matsui et al., 1981; Park & Shore, 1984). Reduction might produce aromatic 
amines which are potentially toxic or carcinogenic (Brown & DeVito, 1993). 
Bacterial degradation might be economical, but isolation of dye-degrading bacteria is 
difficult; furthermore bacteria generally do not non-specifically degrade dyes 
(Zimmerman et al., 1982). The white-rot fungus P. chrysosporium can mineralize 
sulfonated or non-sulfonated azo dyes (Paszczynski et al., 1992; Spadaro et al., 
1992), but these organisms are not suitable for remediating the dye effluent. Thus, it 
appears that more fundamental research will be needed to develop viable alternate 
treatment technologies. 
Some peroxidases can oxidatively degrade azo dyes. Bacteria genetically 
engineered to express these peroxidases might be useful in dye waste treatment. To 
further understand peroxidase-catalyzed azo dye degradation, we studied the substrate 
specificity of HRP, MnP, and Lip using 4-(4'-sulfopheny1azo)-phenol and 2-(4'- 
sulfopheny1azo)-phenol dyes. HRP, MnP, and Lip oxidized variously substituted 4- (4'-sulfopheny1azo)-phenol dyes. All 2-(4'-sulfopheny1azo)-phenol dyes were poor 
substrates or non-substrates for all peroxidases examined. HRP was the most active 
among the three peroxidases. MnP was comparatively specific in dye oxidation, and 
it was particularly ineffective for halogenated dyes. Lip oxidized dyes at very low 
rates. In a Hammett correlation analysis, HRP and MnP preferred dyes with 
electron-donating substituents. Correlations for HRP and MnP oxidation were weak 
and strong, respectively. No correlation with Hammett factors was observed for Lip 
oxidation. These findings suggested that MnP oxidation is primarily controlled by 
electronic effects of substituents, and HRP oxidation might be controlled by electronic 
and other factors. In the case of HRP oxidation, steric hindrance might affect the dye 
oxidation. In particular, steric hindrance of ortho-substituents may influence the dye 
oxidation. Steric effects of substituents might be assessed in a QSAR study. Steric 
parameters, such as steric substituent constants or van der Waals radii, may be useful 
for assessing steric effects of substituents. 
Peroxidases require hydrogen peroxide for azo dye degradation, but laccases, 
which are copper-dependent enzymes, oxidize azo dye in the presence of oxygen 
(Bollag, 1992; Thurston, 1994). Thus, laccase-catalyzed azo dye oxidation might be 
more suitable for remediating the dye effluent than peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation. 
Many white-rot fungi produce extracellular laccases which are involved in lignin 
degradation (Hatakka, 1994). Chivukula and Reganathan (1995) suggested a probable 
mechanism for the degradation of phenolic azo dyes by laccase from Pyricularia 
oryzae. The mechanism was similar to that of peroxidase-catalyzed azo dye 
oxidation. A QSAR study of laccase-catalyzed dye oxidation could provide further 
understanding of oxidative dye degradation. Xu (1996) performed a QSAR study of 
phenol oxidation by several fungal laccases. In that study, a good correlation between 
laccase activity and redox potentials was discovered. It was suggested that the one- 
electron redox potential difference between laccase and its substrate is an important 
factor in phenol oxidation. A similar QSAR study of laccase-catalyzed oxidation of 
azo dyes might be useful. 
Hydroxyl radical-generating systems might be suitable for remediating the dye 
effluent because OH is non-specific and can completely degrade dyes. Since . OH is very reactive and non-specific in its reactions, we expected all dyes to be degraded at 
the same rate. However, we found a weak correlation between the amount of dye 
decolorized and the charge density of the phenolate anion species of the dye, 
indicating that dye oxidation by the Fe'11/~202 system (Fenton chemistry) might be 
limited by . OH attack on the phenolate anion. One of the problems of advanced 
oxidation processes (AOPs) is that additives, such as inorganic anions, organic 
solvents, and detergents, could slow dye oxidation by competing for the OH. 
Surprisingly, we found that nitrate can greatly enhance dye oxidation. We believe 
that AOPs might be applicable to treating effluent-containing low levels of additives 
or to effluent which is pretreated to eliminate organic and inorganic additives. The 
FeO/H,O system readily reduces and decolorizes azo dyes. However, this may not be 
a useful process, because the product amines are potentially toxic or carcinogenic and 
they can also be reoxidized to generate azo dyes. A two-stage process consisting of 
FeO reduction followed by biodegradation is possible. Whereas bacteria are unable to 
degrade azo dyes, they seem to be capable of degrading sulfonated and non-sulfonated 
aromatic amines. Brown and Hamburger (1987) have demonstrated that sulfanilic 
acid is readily degraded by activated sludge. Hammer et al. (1996) also demonstrated 
that a mixed bacterial culture of Hydrogenophaga palleronii strain S1 and 
Agrobacterium radiobacter strain S2 can degrade sulfanilic acid. Haug et al. (1991) 
used a two-stage biodegradation process, anaerobic followed by aerobic, to degrade 
Mordant Yellow 3. Yet another advantage of reduction followed by aerobic 
biodegradation is that, though dyes are structurally complex, they are usually 
produced by combining a few dozen aromatic amines and phenols. Thus, only a few 
bacterial isolates might be sufficient to degrade aromatic amines completely. LITERATURE CITED
