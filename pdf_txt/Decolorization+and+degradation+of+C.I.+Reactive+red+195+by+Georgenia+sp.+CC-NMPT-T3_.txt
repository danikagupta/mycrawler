 Microbiological methods assume interest because of versatile nature of 
microorganisms to elaborate enzyme systems requi red to breakdown the 
chemical compounds thereby eliminating their toxic effect. In a present 
study, biotransformation of Reactive Orange 16, an azo dye by  Georgenia  sp. 
CC-NMPT -T3 was studied under static anoxic condition. It was able to 
decolourize 94.2% of Reactive Orange within 8 h at 50mg/L dye 
concentration. The selected isolate showed dye decolourization over a wide 
range of pH from 6 -8 and temperature 28±2°C - 45°C. The biodegradation 
was confirmed by Uv -Visible spectrophotometry, TLC, HPLC, FTIR and  
GC-MS studies. Enzymatic studies revealed dye decolourization was due to a 
combined activity of Lignin peroxidase, laccase, NADH -DCIP reductase and 
azoreductase. Phytotoxicity studies demonstrated no toxicity of the degraded 
product. The isolate was also able to decolourize mixture of five azo dyes. 
Hence, this isolate could be effectively used for treatment of azo dye 
containing effluent.

Introduction  
Dye being one of the important recalcitrant, persist 
for long distances in flowing water, retards 
photosynthetic activity, inhibit the growth of aquatic 
biota by blocking out the sunlight and utilizing 
dissolved oxygen and also decrease the r ecreation 
value of stream(Rana et al.,2013). Azo dyes are 
considered as electron -deficient xenobiotic 
compounds because they possess the azo (N=N) and 
sulfonic ( -SO3-) electron -withdrawing groups, 
generating electron deficiency in the molecule and 
making t he compound less susceptible to oxidative 
catabolism by bacteria. As a consequence, azo dyes 
tend to persist under aerobic environmental 
conditions (Hakim et al., 2013). Azo dyes have been 
used increasingly in industries because of their ease 
and cost effe ctiveness in synthesis compared to 
natural dyes. However, most azo dyes are toxic, 
carcinogenic and mutagenic (Shah et al., 2013). 
Many microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and 
yeast have been observed to decolorize azo dyes by 
biosorption and biodegrada tion. Decolorization of 
dye waste water is a challenging process to the dye 
industry, and the great potential of microbial decolorizing can be adopted as an effective tool. 
Microorganisms elaborate an array of diverse 
enzymes which can degrade variety of o rganic 
compounds. Hence, in a present study an 
actinobacterium isolate Georgenia  sp. was employed 
for decolourization and degradation of the selected 
dye Reactive Orange 16.   
 
Material and Methods  
Microorganism and culture conditions:

Identification of t he culture:  
The isolate is an actinobacterium which shows rod 
and coccus cycle. 16s r -RNA sequencing of the 
isolated organism was done in GeneOmbio 
Technologies Pvt. Ltd., Pune, India.  
 
Decolourization studies : 
Georgenia  sp.CC -NMPT -T3 was grown for 24 hrs at 
37°C on nutrient agar.10% inoculum of O.D 600 
1.0(Mathew et al.,2004; Parshetti et al., 2009)was 
used throughout the study. Decolourization studies 
were carried out in nutrient broth.  The dye was filter 
sterilized by using 0.2 µm cellulose acetate paper 
filter, Sartorius Biolab, Germany and added after 
sterilization of medium throughout the study. The 
dye (50mg/L) was added immediately and incubated 
at static condition at 37°C. The aliquot (3ml) of 
culture media was wi thdrawn at different time 
intervals and centrifuged at 6000g for 20 min. 
Decolourization with respect to time was monitored 
by measuring the absorbance of the culture at λ max of 
the dye at 495 nm.  In order to detect pH and 
temperature optima of decolouriz ation of the dye by 
the isolate, nutrient broth with different pH ranging 
from 3 -8 was inoculated with 10% inoculum at 
50mg/L dye concentration and was incubated at 
temperatures ranging from 25 -50°C. Abiotic control 
was always kept in each study.  
  Decolou rization performance at different dye 
concentration:  
Once decolourization ability of the isolate was 
confirmed at 50mg/L concentration, the 
decolourization performance of the isolate was 
studied at different dye concentrations from 50 -
500mg/L under the sam e experimental setup. The % 
decolourization was measured after every hour. All 
decolourization experiments were performed in three 
sets. Abiotic controls (without microorganism) were 
always included. The % decolourization was 
calculated as (Sartale et al.,  2009; Sahasrabudhe and 
Pathade, 2012b).  
 
 
 
Decolorization under added  carbon and nitrogen 
sources:  
Decolourization performance under added carbon and 
nitrogen sources was studied in semi synthetic 
medium described by Sartale et al., 2009. The 
medium was supplemented with one percent each of 
glucose, sucrose, lactose and starch, yeast extract, 
peptone, malt extract, meat extract and urea as carbon 
and nitrogen sources, respectively. 50 mg/L of the 
dye concentration used. Filter sterilized dye was 
added aft er sterilization of the medium and after 
inoculation of the isolate.  
Preparation of the cell free extract:  
Twenty four  hours  old culture of the isolate grown 
under pH and temperature optima was   centrifuged at 
10,000 rpm for 20 minutes. These cells were 
suspended in the potassium phosphate buffer (50mM, 
pH 7.4) and sonicated  at output of  50A and giving 7 
strokes each of 30sec for 12 minutes at 4oC.The 
homogenate was centrifuged and supernatant was 
used as a source of enzymes (Kalyani et al., 2008).  
Enzyme assays:  
Oxidative enzymes during decolourization  
The activities of laccase and lignin peroxidase were 
assayed spectrophotometrically in the cell free 
extract. Laccase activity was determined in a mixture 
of 2 ml containing ABTS (10%) in 0.1 M acetate 
buffe r pH 4.9 and measured as an increase in optical 
density at 420nm (Sartale et al., 2009;Kalyani et 
al.,2008 and Telke et al.,2009). Lignin peroxidase 
(LP) activity was determined by monitoring the 
formed propanaldehyde at 300nm in a reaction 
mixture of 2.5 ml containing 100 mM n - propanol, 
250 mM tartaric acid and 10 mM H 2O2(Parshetti et 
al.,2006) . All enzyme assays were carried out at 37°C 
with reference blanks contained all components

 except the assayed enzymes. All enzyme assays were 
conducted in triplicates and the average rates were 
calculated to represent the enzyme activity. One unit 
of enzyme activity was defined as a change in 
absorbance U/ min/ ml of the enzyme.  
  
Reductive enzymes during decolourization  
NADP -DCIP reductase activity was assa yed by 
following the procedure reported by Telke et al.2009. 
The composition the assay mixture (5.0ml) was 
25µM DCIP, 4.75ml of potassium phosphate buffer 
(20mM,pH 7.5) and 0.1ml of enzyme solution. The 
reaction was initiated by addition of 50 µM NADH. 
The decrease in colour intensity of DCIP was 
observed at 595nm.  
Azoreductase activity was determined by monitoring 
the decrease in methyl red concentration at 440nm in 
a reaction mixture of 3.3 ml containing 152µM 
Methyl red, 50mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 
7.4) and 20µM NADH(Sartale et al.,2009) .    
All enzyme assays were conducted in triplicates and 
the average rates were calculated to represent the 
enzyme activity.  
 
Analytical procedure  
The metabolites produced during the biodegradation 
of RO 16 at 8 hrs i.e. after decolourization of the 
medium were extracted twice with equal volume of 
dichloromethane (DCM). The DCM extracts were 
pooled and evaporated at 40°C in a rotary evaporator 
and then transferred to a test tube (Moutaoukkil et al., 
2003). The ext racted residue was dissolved in small 
volume of HPLC grade methanol and the same 
sample was used for analysis. During UV visible 
spectral analysis, changes in absorption spectrum in 
the decolourized medium (400 -800nm) were 
recorded in comparison with the r esults from the 
control runs (Sartale et al., 2009). The mobile phase 
used for TLC was composed of methanol, ethyl 
acetate, n -propanol, water and acetic acid (1:2:3:1:0.2 
v/v) and silica gel plates ‘Merck’ was used for 
separation. TLC plate was developed u sing iodine 
chamber (Sartale et al., 2009;Telke et al.,2009) .   
HPLC analysis was performed in an isocratic system 
Shimadzu (SCL 10 AVP) equipped with dual 
absorbance detector using C 18 column with HPLC 
grade methanol as mobile phase at the flow rate of 
1.0 ml / min for 10 min (Telke et al.,2009).  
The metabolites formed after decolourization of the 
dye by an isolate were identified by using Shimadzu 
GC–MS QP 2010. The ionization voltage was 70 eV. 
Gas chromatography was conducted in temperature 
programmi ng mode with a Resteck column (0.25 mm 
X 9 30 mm). The initial column temperature was 
40°C for 4 min, which was increased linearly at 
10°C/min up to 270°C and held at 4 min. The temperature of injection port was 275°C and GC –MS 
interface was maintained at 300°C. The helium was 
carrier gas; flow rate 1 ml/min and 30 min run time 
(Telke et al. , 2009).  
 
Toxicity study  
Phytotoxicity tests were carried out in order to assess 
the toxicity of RO 16 and metabolites formed after 
decolourization of RO 16. Phytotoxic ity tests were 
carried out at a final concentration of 500 ppm on 
two kinds of seeds. One from grains Sorghum 
vulgare  (monocot) and second from pulses Phaseolus 
mungo  (dicot), commonly cultivated. Phytotoxicity 
was conducted at room temperature (10 seeds o f 
each) by watering separately 5ml sample of control 
RO 16 and its degradation products per day. Control 
set was carried out using distilled water at the same 
time. Germination% as well as the length of plumule 
and radical was recorded after 7 days (Sartal e et al., 
2009).  
 
Statistical analysis  
Data was analyzed by one way analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) with Turkey - Kramer multiple comparison 
test.  Readings were considered significant when P 
was ≤0.05.  
 
Result and Discussion  
Isolation and identification of dye decolourizing 
bacteria:  
Isolation of bacteria was carried out by the 
enrichment technique using nutrient broth and RO 16 
as source of carbon and nitrogen that has rapid 
decolourization capacity. Decolourization occurred 
only when a carbon and nitrogen sources were 
available for growth. Isolated bacterium was Gram 
positive facultative anaerobic motile coccus.  16sr-
RNA  analysis done by geneOmbio Technologies, 
Pune. The nucleotide alignment of this strain showed 
it was most phylogenetically similar to the  Georgenia  
sp.CC -NMPT -T3 (Sahasrabudhe et al., 2012a).  
  
Decolourization studies : 
It is well known that decolourization of dyes by 
bacteria takes place in two ways, either adsorption on 
the microbial biomass or biodegradation of dyes by 
the cells. Dye decolourization can be judged clearly 
by observing the spectrum changes of dyes. Dye 
adsorption to cell reveals the approximate decrease of 
all peaks in proportion to each other, whereas dye 
removal by biodegradation shows the complete 
reduction of the major peaks and the production of 
new peaks at the same time.     
The isolate showed abil ity to decolourize 94.2% of 
RO 16 within 8 hrs at a dye concentration 50 mg/L  . ISSN NO 2320 -5407                            International Journal of Advanced Research (2013), Volume 1, Issue 7, 91-99

 The absorbance peaks in the visible region 
disappeared indicating complete decolourization 
(Elisangela et al., 2009). In the UV spectra the peak 
at 495nm was replaced by new pe ak at 294.5nm.     
There was no abiotic loss of RO 16 within 24 h 
incubation indicating that the decolourization of RO 
16 was due to biological mechanism rather than 
adsorption. To confirm whether this decolourization 
was due to the bacterial action or vari ation in pH, 
change in pH was recorded in the range of 7.1±0.2.  
  
Effect of physiochemical conditions on the 
decolourization performance:  
The effect of various physiochemical conditions such 
as pH, temperature, dye concentration, effect of 
carbon and nitrogen sources on decolourization of 
RO 16 by the isolate were studied in detail. All 
parameters were studied at 37°C under static 
condition. 10% inoculum with O.D 600 1.0 was used at 
a dye concentration 50 mg/L.  
 
Effect of pH  
 
Fig 1 Effect of pH on deco lourization  
 
Bacterial cultures generally exhibit maximum 
decolourization at pH values near 7.0, our culture 
exhibited decolourization activity in the range of pH 
6-8(Fig 1). At pH 3 -5 decolourization observed was 
on an average 27.99±0.96%. The isolate sho wed 
more or less constant decolourization from pH 6 to 8, 
maximum 97.75% being at pH 8.  Generally, bacteria 
show better decolourization and biodegradation 
activities at neutral or basic pH (Ali, 2010). Wang et 
al., 2009 studied decolourization of Reactive  Black 5 
by Enterobacter  EC3. It showed a high 
decolourization rate at pH 7. Sahasrabudhe and 
Pathade, 2012a reported decolourization of Reactive 
Red 195 by Georgenia sp. from pH range 5 -8, 
maximum being at pH 7.  
  Effect of Temperature:  
Various microorga nisms showed their survival at 
various temperatures ranging from 25°C to 50°C 
(Mathew et al., 2004). The isolate showed 
96.175±0.198% decolourization from27 -45°C but at 
50°C there was 79.84% decolourization (Fig. 2). The 
temperature ranging between 30 -40ºC  was found to 
be suitable for the decolorization by S.saprophyticus 
strain AUCASVE3 and a further increase in the 
temperature gradually reduced  decolorization activity 
of bacterial culture. This might be due to decrease in 
bacterial number above the optimal growth 
temperature (Hakim et al., 2013).  
 
 
Fig 2 Effect of temperature on decolourization  
 
Effect of initial dye concentration:  
Actual concentrations of reactive dyes in dye house 
effluent have been reported to range from 60 -
250mg/L (Bhatt et al., 2005).

The isolate showed decolourizing ability up to 350 
mg/L at a faster rat e after which the rate began 
decreasing. It has been proposed that dye 
concentration can influence the efficiency of

 microbial decolourization through a combination of 
factors including the toxicity imposed by dye at 
higher concentration (Bhatt et al.2005) . The isolate 
could decolourize 94.20% of 50 mg/L of the dye in 8 
hrs whereas it took 32 hrs to decolourize 85.24 % of 
500 mg/L ( Fig 3) . Thus, the isolate which could 
decolourize dye up to the reported dye concentration 
in wastewater, can be successfully e mployed for 
treatment of dye bearing industrial wastewater.  
  
Effect of carbon and nitrogen sources:  
While trying to enhance decolourization performance 
of RO 16, extra carbon and nitrogen sources was 
supplied in semi synthetic medium. There was no 
decolou rization in the presence of synthetic media. 
There was no enhanced decolourization in presence 
of urea, glucose and starch. Percentage 
decolourization was maximum with yeast extract and 
sucrose 97.15% and 96.46% respectively within 24 h 
(Fig 4 ). Similar results were also reported by 
bacterial consortium RVM for decolourization of 
reactive violet 5 (Moosvi et al., 2007). The culture 
showed moderate decolourization in the presence of 
sucrose (51.21%) lactose (42.04%) and starch 
(52.00%) and maximum decolour ization was 
reported in presence of glucose (65.88%). In 
addition, supplying urea as a nitrogen source 
exhibited less decolourizing ability (41.57%). In 
contrast, addition of carbon sources seemed to be less 
effective to promote the decolourization probabl y due 
to the preference of the cells in assimilating the added 
carbon sources over using the dye compound as the 
carbon source. Shah et al., 2013 reported  percentage 
decolorization (95%) was maximum with purified 
substrate peptone while less decolorization  with other 
supplements of carbon and nitrogen source in 
degradation of Ramazol Black B by  Bacillus  ETL-
2012.

decolourization  
 Analysis of metabolites resulting from 
decolourization and biodegradation of RO 16 by  
Georgenia  sp.CC -NMPT -T3: 
 
In order to understand the possible mechanism of the 
dye decolourization, we also analyzed the products of 
degradation of RO 16 by UV visible spectral 
analysis, TLC, HPLC,  FTIR and GC -MS. 
UV visible scan (400 -800nm) of the c ulture 
supernatant withdrawn at different time intervals 
indicated the decolourization and decrease in dye 
concentration from batch culture. Peak obtained at 
495 nm decreased at complete decolourization. The 
absorbance peak in the visible region disappeare d 
indicating complete decolourization. In the UV 
spectra, the peak at 495 nm was replaced by new 
peak at 294.5nm.  
TLC analysis showed the appearance of one spot in 
the sample containing the extracted metabolites of 
completely decolourized medium with Rf value 0.81 
wheres Rf value of RO 16 was noted as 0.92 
confirming the biodegradation of RO 16 by  
Georgenia  sp.CC -NMPT -T3. 
 
HPLC  
HPLC elution profile of RO 16 showed prominent 
peak at retention time 1.65, 1.94, 2.93and 3.39 min 
while degradation products by Georgeni a sp.  show 
2.668, 2.741, 2.912, 3.008, 3.467 and 3.851 min.  The 
analysis showed the presence of new peak with 
disappearance of the peaks of RO 16 confirming the 
degradation of the dye by  Georgenia  sp.CC -NMPT -
T3. (Fig 5 A and Fig 5 B ).

Jadhav et al. (2010) reported that RO16 showed 
specific peaks in the fingerprint region for distributed 
and multisubstituted benzene and naphthalene ring which is supported by the peaks of 628 cm -1 for C-C 
bending vibrations, 664 cm -1 for S=O stretching for 
sulphonic acid. 830 cm -1 and 895 cm -1 for C -H 
bending vibrations. The group frequency region 
shows specific peaks for functional groups. The 
peaks at 1496 cm -1 for C=C stretching vibrations of

study showed phenolic O -H and N -H stretch at 
3385.42 cm -1, N=N azo group a t 1664.27 cm -1, 1500 
cm-1 showed N -H bending and C=C ring, 1235cm -1 
indicates C -N stretch, 1049 cm -1 showing S=O 
stretch whereas 831 cm -1, 612.288 cm -1 indicating 
C-H bending and C -C bending vibrations. FTIR 
spectrum of the extracted metabolites showed 
absence of azo group and appearance of new groups 
confirming dye degradation.

 Enzyme assays:  
 
 Fig 7 Enzymes involved in degradation  
In order to get the details of the enzymes involved in 
decolourization mechanism lignin peroxidase, laccase 
and NADP -DCIP reductase were monitored after 
complete decolourization. No activities of enzymes 
were observed  in the cell free supernatant. Enzymatic 
profile of uninduced cells and induced cells of  
Georgenia  sp.CC -NMPT -T3  obtained after complete 
decolourization was studied ( Fig 7 ). Enzyme profile 
showed enhanced activity of Laccase, Lignin 
peroxidase and azored uctase. It can be presumed that 
the major mechanism of decolourization in the cells 
is mostly because of the biotransformation enzymes 
i.e. laccase, lignin peroxidase and azoreductase. The 
relative contribution of enzymes to decolourization of 
dye may be d ifferent for each microorganism. Telke 
et al., 2009 also reported significant induction in 
NADH -DCIP reductase after 24 h of decolorization 
of Reactive orange 16 by isolated Bacillus  strain.   
Similarly bacteria are also able to produce 
peroxidase, which c an degrade azo dyes. The 
induction of these enzymes suggests the prominent 
role of these enzymes in the decolourization process. 
This supports the earlier observations.  
 
Phytotoxicity study:  
Despite the fact, untreated dyeing effluent may cause 
the seriou s environmental and health hazards. They 
are being disposed off in the water bodies and this 
water can be used for irrigation purpose. Thus it was 
found necessary to access the phytotoxicity of the 
dye before and after degradation. The relative 
sensitiviti es towards the dye RO 16 and its 
degradation products in relation to Sorghum  vulgare  
and Phaseolus mungo  seeds were presented in the Fig 
8 A and Fig 8B , respectively.  There is no significant difference in the root and 
shoot length in case of Sorghum vulgar e irrigated 
with the dye but in case of metabolite irrigated, the 
root and shoot length was significantly increased (p ≤ 
0.05)as compared to control wheat.  
There is no significant difference in the root and 
shoot length in case of Phaseolus mungo  irrigated  
with the dye and the root length of mung seeds 
irrigated with metabolite but in case of metabolite 
irrigated ,shoot length was significantly increased (p 
≤ 0.05)as compared to control mung seed.  
Phytotoxicity study showed good germination rate as 
well as  significant growth in the plumule and radical 
for both the selected plants (P ≤ 0.05) in the 
metabolites extracted after decolourization as 
compared to dye sample. This indicates the 
detoxification of RO 16 by the isolated bacterial 
culture.

GC-MS analysis  of  degradation products : 
Reactive Orange 16 degradation products suggested 
the breakdown of azo bond. Azo dyes can be cleaved 
symmetrically or asymmetrically, with an active site 
available for an enzyme to excite the molecu le. The 
induced status of lignin  peroxidase after 12 h of 
decolorization and formation of 6 -acetamido 
naphthol 2 -sulfonic acid and hydroperoxy ethyl 
sulfone phenyl dizonium intermediates suggested 
asymmetric cleavage of C .I. Reactive Orange 16 by lignin per oxidase enzyme. Significant induction of 
NADH –DCIP reductase after 24 h of decolorization 
and formation of dihydroperoxy benzene and 6 -
nitroso naphthol intermediates suggested reduction of 
intermedia te metabolites (Telke et al., 2009).  
In the present study, (Fig 9)  a peak at m/z value of 
279 was identified as 6 acetamido naphthol 2 sulfonic 
acid whereas a peak at m/z value of 170 indicates 6 -
niitroso naphthol confirming degradation of Reactive 
Orange 1 6 in small molecular weight compounds. 
Similar results were reported by Telke et al., 2009.

Hence this indigenous bacterial strain could be 
utilized for treatment of dye containing wastewater.
