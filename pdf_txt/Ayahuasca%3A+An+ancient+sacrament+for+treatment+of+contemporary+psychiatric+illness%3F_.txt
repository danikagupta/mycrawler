Summary
Ayahuasca, also known as “the liana of the soul” and “the vine of the soul” is a ritual 
psychedelic traditionally administered in the form of plant decoction, used by the indigenous 
people of South America for centuries, and in the last 25 years also in Europe, Asia, Africa, 
Australia, Canada, and the United States. Its biological activity results from the content of 
N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), acting mainly as a non-selective agonist of serotonin recep -
tors and beta-carboline alkaloids, which are strong and short-acting monoamine oxidase type 
A (MAOI-A) inhibitors. For many years there have been reports of both the anti-anxiety and 
antidepressant effects of ayahuasca, as well as indications of the possibility of its use in the 
treatment of addictions. The results of studies of its effectiveness in drug-resistant depression 
seem to be promising, comparable in the opinion of some authors with the effect of thera-
peutic action of ketamine. In the article, we try to explain the complex profile of action and 
the resulting potential benefits, but also the risk of interaction and adverse effects associated 
with the taking of ayahuasca, which is important given the high variability of herbal mixtures 
used to produce the decoction.
Key words: ayahuasca, DMT
Introduction
Ayahuasca is a ritual psychedelic used by the people of South America for 
centuries. Traditionally, it is administered in the form of a decoction during a few 
hours of night rituals, which are led by a shaman providing spiritual support, what 
increases the therapeutic effect of meetings [1]. The two largest religious associations 
practicing rituals are Unia Do Vegetal (UDV) and Santo Daime, whose branches 
are spread all over the world. However, only in Brazil (since 1987 ) and the United Aleksandra Barabasz-Gembczyk, Krzysztof Kucia382
States (since 2006) it is legally permissible to use ayahuaska provided that it is used 
for religious purposes only. In Poland, the ingredients of the decoction are on the 
list of narcotic and psychoactive substances. Ayahuasca is characterized by poor 
tolerance from the digestive system causing vomiting, nausea and diarrhea. Tradi-
tionally this is considered to be its ‛purification’ effect [2]. It also causes an increase 
in blood pressure, heart rate [3], increases body temperature and the concentration 
of prolactin and cortisol [4].
This paper summarizes the literature collected on the basis of a review of the 
Medline/Pubmed database. PubMed database was searched using the following terms: 
‛ayahuasca’, ‛hoasca’, ‛DMT’, ‛N,N-dimethyltryptamine’, ‛psychedelics’. Materials 
appearing from 1987 to November 2018 were analyzed.
DMT and beta-carboline alkaloids: pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics
Most often a  blend of plants Banisteriopsis caapi  and Psychotria viridis or Diplop -
terys cabrerana is used for the preparation of ayahuasca brew. Psychoactive effects of 
Psychotria viridis and Diplopterys cabrerana is associated with the presence of DMT, 
a tryptamine derivative that is a non-selective agonist of serotonergic receptors, mainly 
5-HT2A [5]. The substance also has affinity for receptors σ1 [6], α1 and α2-adrenergic, 
dopamine D1 [7] and trace amine receptors TAARs [8]. Although DMT is in a very 
small amount produced in the human body, there is insufficient information about the 
biosynthesis and biochemical properties of its endogenous form. In general, DMT in 
the human body is very rapidly metabolized and inactivated regardless of the way of 
administration. After injection, the duration of action is 15–60 minutes, after inhala -
tion – up to 30 minutes [9]. When administered orally, it has no biological activity 
due to its rapid metabolism to inactive forms through the gastrointestinal and hepatic 
monoamine oxidase (MAO). In the composition of ayahuasca, there is also Baniste -
riopsis caapi, containing a group of beta-carboline alkaloids: harmaline, harmine and 
tetrahydroharmine. Alkaloids, as a potent and short-acting MAO-A inhibitors, slow 
down the metabolism of DMT and allow it to function after oral administration after 
20 minutes, reaching a peak between 1 and 2 hours and ending after about 4–5 hours 
[4]. Beta-carboline alkaloids also have affinity for 5-HT2A/C receptors, dopamine 
transporters and imidazole receptors I2 [2].
Side effects
Ayahuaska can cause serious, life-threatening side effects. By acting as MAOI 
it increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Also it has been shown to interact with 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [10]. The occurrence of symptoms of seroto-
nin and myoclonic syndrome after administration of beta-carboline alkaloids with 
tryptophan has been described in rodents [11]. Harmine, as a substrate and inhibitor 
of CYP2D6 [12, 13], can cause interaction with its other substrates. Randomized 383 Ayahuasca – potential therapeutic properties in psychiatry. Research review
research in which ayahuasca was administered to people in the form of lyophilized 
extract showed its acceptable safety [2]. It was estimated that the lethal dose is about 
20 times higher than the average dose administered during rituals [14]. So far, no 
death has been reported in ayahuasca clinical research. Several documented cases of 
death have been described, including suicide, after ritual use of ayahuasca, in which 
their causal relationship cannot be clearly identified [1]. They do not contain key 
information, such as the blood analysis for beta-carboline alkaloids, the composi-
tion of the decoction and the dose ingested, which limits the possibility of drawing 
final conclusions [15]. In other words, there are no documented data showing clearly 
ayahuasca poisoning as the cause of death. On the other hand, the analysis of 538 
cases reported by telephone to the US Poison Control Centers from 2005 to 2015 
related to ayahuasca is disturbing [16]. It shows that 63% of reports were related to 
moderate or severe somatic and psychopathological symptoms, in which 28 cases 
required intubation, 12 had seizure, 7 – respiratory arrest, 4 – cardiac arrest. Three 
fatalities were reported. It should be emphasized, however, that the report covers only 
telephone notification, without a detailed analysis. It is not known what mixture of 
plants or what substances exactly were used.
Psychomimetic effects
Gable [14], on the basis of a 5-year observation of UDV members, concluded 
that ayahuasca does not increase the risk of long-term psychosis. In the analyzed 
documentation, containing an exposure to 25,000 portions of decoction (without 
specifying the number of people, only exposure), from 13 to 24 cases were reported 
in which the substance could contribute to the induction of psychotic episodes. When 
comparing the result with the risk of schizophrenia in the general population, Gable 
postulates that consuming ayahuasca cannot be considered as a trigger for permanent 
psychosis. Lima et al. [17] came to a similar conclusion in a report analyzing cases 
of psychotic disorders among UDV members from 1994–2007. There is a report of 
paranoid syndrome after ritual consumption of ayahuasca preceded by a 6-year of 
cannabinols intake period [18] and mania with psychotic symptoms preceded by a 10-
day hypomanic episode in a person confirming their occurrence in the past [19]. Two 
psychosis cases with features of manic-paranoid syndrome after simultaneous intake 
of DMT and cannabinols have also been published [20, 21]. So far, in clinical trials, 
there were no cases of correlation between ayahuasca or DMT and chronic psychosis, 
which can be explained by an accurate interview of clinical trial participants towards 
possible predisposing factors for psychosis [18].
Addiction – risk vs. therapeutic properties
So far, the physical addictive effect of ayahuasca has not been demonstrated, 
and no withdrawal symptoms have been observed in available studies [14, 22, 23]. Aleksandra Barabasz-Gembczyk, Krzysztof Kucia384
It does not activate the reward system in the striatum and the ventral tegmental area, 
it only increases the flow of blood in the frontal and paralimbal areas, as shown in the 
single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) [24]. It is assumed, however, 
that ayahuasca can demonstrate addictive potential through positive reinforcement. 
15–20% of people taking part in the ritual for the first time become members of UDV 
[14]. Rodent research provides encouraging data on the potential benefits of its use 
in addiction. There have been reports of a reduction in the symptoms of cocaine and 
morphine dependence when administering harmine in rats [25] as well as the inhibition 
of the development of alcohol addiction behavior in ayahuasca-treated mice [26, 27]. 
Available clinical reports based on surveys (which reduces the value of this informa -
tion) prove that ayahuasca may show therapeutic effects in people addicted to other 
psychoactive substances [22, 28–31]. However, it is difficult to separate the action of 
the substance itself from the psychological effect of the symbolism of the ritual or the 
significance of the collective therapeutic factor [22, 32, 33].
Long-term effects of ayahuasca
Studies of people using ritual decoction show that the long-term effect is a reduc-
tion in the severity of psychopathological symptoms, mainly in terms of mood and 
anxiety [23, 28, 34]. The respondents also describe better psychosocial and pro-health 
functioning [23, 31, 35, 36]. Regular ayahuasca users achieve better results in cogni-
tive function tests [37]. Riba et al. [38] published a randomized clinical trial based on 
the regional cerebral blood flow observed in SPECT, during which fifteen volunteers, 
previously using ayahuasca, were orally administered its capsule at a dose correspond-
ing to 1.0 mg DMT/kg body weight or placebo. Significant activation of the frontal 
and paralimbal areas was found 100–110 minutes later . The results of neuroimaging 
examinations  of 22 people who took ayahuasca at least 50 times in the last 2 years 
were compared to the results of 22 people who did not use this substance, there were 
no differences in their age, gender, education and level of intelligence. Significant 
differences in the thickness of the cortex in the brain, especially in structures forming 
the default mode network (DMN) have been demonstrated. They were correlated with 
the intensity and duration of ayahuasca use [39].
DMN is the area of the brain responsible for internally oriented mental processes 
whose increased activity is found in depression, schizophrenia, social phobia, and re-
duced activity – during meditation and hypnosis. Palhano-Fontes et al. [40] document 
the results of research showing a decrease in DMN activity in the functional magnetic 
resonance imaging after ayahuasca administration.
Antidepressant effect – experimental research
Experimental studies on animal models of depression have shown that chronic 
administration of harmine reduces anergy and anhedonia as well as increases adrenal 385 Ayahuasca – potential therapeutic properties in psychiatry. Research review
mass and BDNF levels in the rodent hippocampus [41, 42], which suggests antidepres-
sant effect [34]. In vitro studies of progenitor cells of adult rodents have shown that 
the alkaloids of Banisteriopsis caapi  stimulate neurogenesis. This effect is comparable 
to the effect of antidepressants [43]. Cameron L.P et al. [44] studied the influence of 
DMT on rat behavior, confirming its antidepressant and anxiolytic effect.
In 2017, research was published [45] on the validated animal model of depression in 
primates (Callitrix jacchus) with hypocortisolemia, which were given nortriptyline for 
7 days and a single dose of ayahuasca. Ayahuasca has been shown to increase cortisol 
levels up to 48 hours after administration. It also shows a stronger antidepressant ef-
fect, faster and more lasting hypercortisolemia compared to nortriptyline. In a juvenile 
animal model of depression presented by de Silva et al. ayahuasca presented beneficial 
long-lasting antidepressant effect [46].
Antidepressant effect – research in humans
There are reports [43, 47] of a rapid, already occurring after the first exposure, 
antidepressant effect of ayahuasca in patients diagnosed with drug-resistant depression. 
The effect is noticeable after 1 hour of administration and lasts up to 21 days [24, 47]. 
In 2018 a randomized, double-blind trial among 29 patients with confirmed drug-resistant 
depression was published. Single doses of placebo or ayahuasca containing 0.36 mg/ml 
DMT, 1.86 mg/ml harmine, 0.24 mg/ml harmaline and 1.20 mg/ml tetrahydroharmine 
were administered, showing a rapid antidepressant effect, persisting up to day 7 after 
a single administration. According to the authors [34], the obtained results are compa-
rable to the effect of therapeutic action of ketamine in drug-resistant depression.
In a study of 17 depressed [24] patients, 8 hours after a single administration of 
2.2 ml/kg of ayahuasca, there was an increased SPECT blood flow in the brain areas 
responsible for mood and emotions, and there was a significant reduction in the sever -
ity of illness symptoms during the period of time from 80 minutes to 21 days after 
administration.
In vitro studies [48] of human progenitor nerve cells derived from human pluri-
potent stem cells showed that harmine after a 4-day experiment increased their pro-
liferation by 71.5%.
The results of a randomized trial [49] have been also published. The authors of 
the study assumed that hypocortisolemia is specific for drug-resistant depression, and 
showed an increase in salivary cortisol level after the administration of a single dose 
of ayahuasca, in which the concentration of DMT was 0.36 mg/ml, harmine – 1.86 
mg/ml, harmaline – 0.24 mg/ml, and tetrahydroharmine – 1.20 mg/ml.
Conclusions
As it has been shown, the ayahuasca components seem to have a potential thera-
peutic value in the treatment of mental illnesses and disorders. However, due to the Aleksandra Barabasz-Gembczyk, Krzysztof Kucia386
small number of research groups and randomized trials, this results should be ap-
proached with caution. An additional difficulty in continuing work on this issue are 
legal restrictions. The United Nations recommends having DMT only for scientific 
and medical purposes. In Poland, Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis can 
be used only for medical and scientific purposes, but DMT only for the purpose of 
scientific research. This may result in the inability to carry out extensive clinical tri-
als, as well as to prevent the use of these substances in pharmacotherapy, as is the 
case with cannabinoids.
