IX Abstract  
Society development is leading to an unbridled search for new and more complex products. 
This enables more intensive production  processes, yielding effluents containing pollutants with a 
high environm ental impact, particularly in hydric media. The problems arising from such activities 
require manufacturing processes adaptation due to environmental restrictions (pollution reduction at 
source). However, when it becomes impossible, the application of adeq uate treatment technologies 
is requested to the specificity of industrial facilities and the environment where the wastewater will 
be discharged.  
Among the existing set of techno -economic solutions, stand out the Advanced Oxidation 
Processes (AOPs). They a re so named because they originate hydroxyl radicals HO•, which are 
highly oxidative being able of degrading a wide range of contaminants. Among these systems, those 
that operate at ambient temperature and pressure as Fenton and ozonation processes are eco nomically 
hihlighted.  
In this ambit and as the motivating key objective of the present thesis, the performed work 
arose to give an answer to the requests made to Adventech for the development of wastewater 
treatment solutions from many different industries  and resulted into several commercial proposals. 
Thus, the overall goal of this research embraced the development and optimization of Advanced 
Oxidation Processes in order to be integrated with biological treatment systems. Therefore, several 
integrated tr eatment schemes were analyzed, with the main target to scrutinize their viability and 
proceed with the implementation at industrial scale  
In this context, the effluent resulting from olive oil mills characterized by high levels of 
Chemical Oxygen Demand (C OD) and low biodegradability (BOD 5/COD) was subject of study. 
Various treatment processes were applied and among them, coagulation / flocculation followed by 
the homogeneous Fenton process was tested to potentiate a posterior biological treatment. A 
coagul ation / flocculation pre -treatment shows to be essential to enhance homogeneous Fenton 
process for the production of a treated waste water with the requirements for disposal into the 
municipal collector, allowing to obtain 90% of COD reduction and 92% abat ement in Total Phenolic 
Content.  
The treated effluent revealed also a significant biodegradability increase (0.05 to 0.65) and a 
decrease of 95% and 96% of Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), 
respectively. Subsequently, the obtai ned results were extrapolated for a real waste water treatment 
plant (WWTP), located in the province of Extremadura, Spain, where approximately 1,000 m3 of 
oleic effluent were treated. In this unit up to 30% of COD reduction was achieved in the coagulation   
X stage and a maximum removal of 90% during the oxidation process was obtained, being possible to 
discharge treated water with 200 mgO 2.L-1. 
The seasonal effluent from elderberry processing, with a low biodegradability (BOD 5/COD 
= 0.05) and a low/moderate C OD (680 mg O 2. L-1) was purpose object of study too. The oxidation 
by Fenton treatment was able to achieve an abatement of 70% for the chemical oxygen demand, 
corresponding to an amount lower than 150 mgO 2.L-1, as well as complete removal of the phenol 
content and an increased biodegradability to 0.2 (BOD 5 < 40 mgO 2. L-1) enabling its  direct disposal 
into drain water.  
Due to seasonality, with high flow rates and organic loads during the harvesting season, the 
wineries WWTP are oversized in relation to thei r requirements over the remaining year. Thus it was 
intended to develop a technology with the aim of reducing the operational and investment costs, and 
contribute to diminish the shortcomings regarding the treatment effectiveness in the productive 
period. The winery effluent, that tends to be acid (pH=  4.6), with a high COD (5500 mgO 2.L-1) and 
a reduced biodegradability (BOD 5/COD=  0.23), was subjected to depurative treatment involving 
coagulation/flocculation and Fenton’s process. At the end an effluent wit h pH of 8.5, COD removal 
of about 60% (2240 mg O 2.L-1) and an increase in biodegradability to 0.40 was attained, thus enabling 
an efficient biological treatment. This was subsequently confirmed through the resulting effluent 
from the biological system (ret ention time of 10 days) with COD values below 150 mg O 2.L-1, 
allowing the effluent water discharge into the hydro resources.  
Another study undertaken along the present work was the treatment of landfill leachate. 
Single and hydrogen peroxide aided (O 3/H2O2) ozononation were tested in order to increasing the 
biodegradability and lowering the wastewater toxicity. The highest organic matter removal was 
observed for higher pH values when using ozone assisted with hydrogen peroxide with a removal of 
45% in COD a nd 89% of color reduction.  Additionally, an increase of the BOD 5/COD ratio from 
0.05 to 0.29 resulted in an effluent near to the limit threshold for discharge into the municipal 
collector showing also high potential for further biological treatment.  
Two d ifferent wastewaters coming from the washing vegetables (VW) and chemical 
production (CP) were submitted to ozone stage treatments O 3 and O 3/H2O2. This combined system 
revealed higher oxidation potential of those two reaction systems with superior values o f COD and 
TOC removal. Indeed, 100% (0 mgO 2.L-1) decrease for COD and 33% (38 mgC.L-1) reduction for 
TOC after 120 min were reached for the VW effluent, whereas for the CP effluent 96% (38 mgO 2.L-
1) for COD degradation and 66% (62 mgC.L-1) for TOC lessenin g were obtained after 180 minutes  
XI of reaction. With these results it was concluded that the wastewate reuse was possible and feasible, 
fulfilling all environmental requirements.  
An industrial effluent from the automotive cable coating production, refractor y to biological 
oxidation (biodegradability <0.11), and with high content in COD (10500 ± 1240 mgO 2.L-1) was also 
a case study. Some pre -treatments such as coagulation/flocculation, Fenton and ozonation processes 
were tested. Afterwards, it was concluded t hat combining the oxidative mechanisms of ozone (direct 
and indirect oxidation) with sequences of defined stages, caused by the pH changes along the 
oxidation, allowed to reach in 24 h operation 98.2% COD removal with a final value of 220 mgO 2.L-
1. 
After t he treatment of different effluents and achieving so different depurative operating 
conditions, it was noteworthy that it is necessary to develop specific and differentiated treatment 
systems in accordance to the characteristics of the effluent and the fin al aim for the treated water.
 
 
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
XIII Resumo  
A evolução da sociedade originou uma procura desenfreada por novos produtos cada vez 
mais complexos, tornando os processos produtivos mais intensivos, originando efluentes que contêm 
poluentes co m um elevado impacte ambiental, em particular nos meios hídricos. Os problemas 
decorrentes destas atividades requerem a adaptação dos processos de fabrico às restrições ambientais 
(redução de poluição na fonte). No entanto, quando isto se torna impossível,  recorre -se à instalação 
de tecnologias de tratamento adequada à especificidade das unidades industriais e do meio para onde 
as águas residuais serão descarregadas.  
No conjunto de soluções tecno -económicas existentes, destacam -se os Processos Avançados 
de Oxidação (AOPs). São assim denominados porque originam radicais hidroxilo HO•, os quais são 
altamente oxidativos sendo capazes de degradar um vasto conjunto de contaminantes. De entre estes 
sistemas de tratamento, destacam -se aqueles que operam à temperatu ra e pressão ambiente como os 
processos de Fenton e de Ozonólise.  
Neste âmbito, e como motivação chave da presente tese, os trabalhos efetuados decorreram 
com o intuito de dar resposta às solicitações realizadas à Adventech para desenvolvimento de 
soluções  de tratamento de efluentes provenientes das mais variadas indústrias, tendo resultado em 
propostas comerciais. Assim, o objetivo global neste trabalho de investigação é o desenvolvimento 
e otimização de Processos Avançados de Oxidação de modo a serem inte grados com sistemas de 
tratamento biológico, para além dos tratamentos primários existentes, e determinar de que modo a 
conjugação dos diferentes tipos de tratamento se torna uma metodologia depurativa efetiva, tendo 
como principal objetivo escrutinar a su a viabilidade e proceder à sua implementação à escala 
industrial.  
Neste contexto, os efluentes provenientes de lagares de Azeite caracterizados por elevados 
teores de Carência Química de Oxigénio (CQO) e baixa biodegradabilidade (CBO 5/CQO) foram alvo 
de es tudo. Assim, foram aplicados processos de tratamento variados, entre os quais 
coagulação/floculação, seguidos do processo de Fenton homogéneo, e análise da possibilidade de 
aplicação de um posterior tratamento biológico. A integração de um processo como 
coagulação/floculação mostrou ser essencial para potenciar o processo de Fenton homogéneo, 
conseguindo -se através desta associação a produção de uma água residual tratada com os requisitos 
necessários à sua descarga em coletor municipal, obtendo -se uma reduç ão de 90% e 92% da CQO e 
Conteúdo Total Fenólico, respetivamente. O efluente tratado obteve um aumento significativo da sua 
biodegradabilidade (de 0.05 para 0.65) e uma redução dos Sólidos Suspensos Totais (SST) e Sólidos 
Dissolvidos Totais (SDT) de 95% e 96% respetivamente. Posteriormente extrapolaram -se os  
XIV resultados obtidos para uma ETARI real, situada na província da Estremadura, Espanha, onde foram 
depurados aproximadamente 1000 m3 de efluente oleico. Nesta unidade obteve -se uma redução de 
30% da CQO n o estágio da coagulação e atingiu -se uma redução máxima de 90% de CQO durante 
o processo oxidativo, descarregando uma água tratada com 200 mgO 2.L-1. 
O efluente sazonal proveniente da transformação de baga de sabugueiro, apresenta uma 
diminuta biodegradabil idade (CBO 5/CQO = 0.05 e CQO moderado 680 mg O 2. L-1) e foi também 
objeto de estudo. A oxidação pelo tratamento de Fenton permitiu uma redução de 70% da carência 
química de oxigénio, atingindo um valor inferior a 150 mgO 2.L-1. Por outro lado, este sistema 
permitiu a remoção total do conteúdo fenólico e um aumento de biodegradabilidade para 0.2 (CBO 5 
<40 mgO 2.L-1), atingindo -se os valores limites de descarga em vala hídrica.  
Devido à sazonalidade, com elevados caudais e carga orgânicas durante a vindima, as 
ETARS vinícolas são sobredimensionadas em relação às suas necessidades durante o restante ano. 
Pretendeu -se deste modo desenvolver uma tecnologia de modo a reduzir os custos operacionais e de 
investimento, e contribuir para a diminuição das deficiências ao  nível da eficiência do tratamento, na 
época produtiva. O efluente vinícola, com pH tendencialmente ácido (4.6), um CQO elevado 5500 
(mgO 2.L-1) e uma biodegradabilidade diminuta (CBO 5/CQO de 0.23), foi sujeito a tratamento 
depurativo. No final do tratament o conseguindo um efluente com pH de 8.5, uma remoção de CQO 
de aproximadamente 60% (2240 mg O 2.L-1) e um aumento da biodegradabilidade para 0.40, 
possibilitando assim um tratamento biológico eficiente, comprovado posteriormente com um 
efluente resultante d e tratamento biológico (com um tempo de retenção de 10 dias) com valores 
inferiores a 150 mg O 2.L-1 permitindo que este efluente seja descarregado em vala hídrica.  
Outro objeto de estudo foi o tratamento de Lixiviados de aterro sanitário. Procedeu -se ao 
tratamento por ozonólise simples e também auxiliada por peróxido de hidrogénio (O 3/H2O2) com 
intuito de aumentar a biodegradabilidade e diminuir a toxicidade da água residual. A maior remoção 
de matéria orgânica foi verificada a pH’s elevados quando se utili zou ozono coadjuvado com 
peróxido de hidrogénio com uma remoção de 45% da COD, 89% de cor e um aumento da razão 
CBO 5/CQO de 0.05 para 0.29 resultando um efluente com um valor perto do limite para descarga 
em coletor municipal mas igualmente com elevado pot encial para posterior tratamento biológico.  
Dois efluentes distintos, provenientes da lavagem de produtos hortícolas (VW) e da produção 
de químicos (CP) foram submetidos a ozonólise (O 3) e O 3/H2O2. O sistema combinado O 3/H2O2 
apresentou um maior potencial de oxidação com valores superiores de remoção de COD e TOC, 
alcançando 100% (0 mgO 2.L-1) e 33% (38 mgC.L-1) após 120 min para o efluente VW e 96% (38 
mgO 2.L-1) e 66% (62 mgC.L-1) para o efluente CP após 180 minutos de reação. Com os resultados  
XV obtidos é po ssível concluir que a reutilização das águas residuais é possível e viável preenchendo 
todos os requisitos ambientais.  
Um efluente industrial proveniente da produção de revestimento de cablagem automóvel 
refratário à oxidação biológica (biodegradabilidade <0.11), com um elevado teor de CQO 
(10500±1240 mgO 2.L-1) foi alvo de estudo. Como metodologias de tratamento, foram testados alguns 
sistemas como coagulação/floculação, Processo de Fenton e Ozonólise. Posteriormente concluiu -se 
que combinando os mecanismos  oxidativos do ozono (oxidação direta e indireta) com sequências de 
fases definidas, promovidas pela variação de pH ao longo da oxidação, alcançou -se em 24 h de 
operação, 98.2 % de remoção de CQO com um valor final de 220 mgO 2.L-1. 
Após o tratamento de dif erentes efluentes e com a obtenção de condições operatórias 
depurativas distintas, é de realçar que é necessário desenvolver sistemas de tratamento diferenciados 
e específicos de acordo as características do efluente e com o objetivo de tratamento. Sendo, portanto, 
fulcral tratar cada água residual como um caso de estudo requerendo um screening para selecionar 
os processos de tratamento mais promissores seguidos de uma otimização cuidada.

 I. INTRODUCTION   
 
1 I. INTRODUCTION    
A new kind of technologies has assumed a major role and takes a more prominent part in 
water treatment in last ye ars, the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). These methodologies show 
to be effective for numerous applications such as disinfection of drinking water and removal of a 
wide variety of organic contaminants and pollutants from wastewaters.  
However, these p rocesses still need to be further studied and enhanced so that their 
implementation and application can be widespread. The new approach of application involves their 
integration with biological treatments, trying to combine the capabilities of each step wh en compared 
with the efficiencies and costs of a single system.  
The main objective of wastewater treatment technologies is to achieve the prerequisite 
quality of the treated effluents for its discharge, whether in municipal collector or hydro ditch or even  
reuse. Therefore, depending on each referred final destination the treatment requirements will vary.  
Currently there are several depuration methods for wastewater that , independently or 
combined, allow to fulfill the regulation requests in the resultant treated wastewaters. For this reason, 
an exhaustive labor in R&D is needed for developing, testing, designing and installing efficient and 
economical wastewater treatments in accordance with the effluents characterization and to the 
desired quality of fina l water .  
  Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
 
2 I.1 Water and Environmental Pollution  
The industrial production of new compounds in order to sustain the progress and emerging 
demands of  human life leads to an exponential consume of raw materials, an unbalanced spending 
of hydrological resources  and to a huge amount of contaminated effluents (Martins and Quinta -
Ferreira, 2011; Poyatos et al., 2009).  
Water must be considered as a priceless natural reserve indispensable to ensure the adequate 
development of living activities. Consequently, the inc reased public concern has been forcing 
governments to improve environmental restrictions by imposing more stringent guidelines to such 
wastewaters production and disposal. Beyond this, environmental pollution of atmosphere and soil 
are also of concern. In general, pollution can be described as an adverse change in chemical, physical 
and biological characteristics of air, water and land that can affect society health, ecosystems 
behavior, industrial development, and cultural assets (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004 ). 
The major sources of water pollution can be classified as municipal, industrial, and 
agricultural. Water pollutants can be organic and inorganic compounds and heavy metals, all 
substances with properties to make it undrinkable or inappropriate for the s upport of animal and plant 
life (Martins et al., 2010). Inadequate water treatment systems capable of reducing the concentration 
of toxic substances leads certainly to a deterioration of water sources quality and, thus, of drinking 
water. Apossible result of this action is serious irreversible damage for the ecossystems, ranging from 
the weakening or vanishing of a determined life environment to changes in the health of those entities 
living there.  
Industrial processes are characterized by the production of  toxic and complex effluents, 
whose pollutants nature and composition differ as function of the industrial sector.  Normally, 
industry may deliver environmental contaminants as solid wastes, liquid materials, and polluted 
gases. These are the result of pro cess stages and systems transformation, which are meant to be 
dumped and whose composition contains often substances in such quantities that are effectively 
dangerous to the health of humans and to the quality of natural resources needing this way a treatm ent 
process or individual disposal. Indeed, industrial wastewaters presenting a miscellaneous matrix of 
different pollutants contain often bio refractory compounds that are very hard to treat through 
traditional systems such as those based on biological ap proaches because of their resistance, 
inhibitory character or toxicity (Martins et al., 2011). In such cases, where the biological treatment 
procedures are not effective, except if there is a specific treatment, wastes finish up being discharged 
into the e nvironment, leading that a small volume of wastewater is capable of contaminating a huge 
quantity of natural water .   
3 Agro -industrial wastewaters are normally characterized by variable volume and wide 
diversity of chemical products commonly presenting suspe nded solids, unstable pH, high Chemical 
Oxygen Demand (COD), high Total Organic Carbon (TOC), low Biochemical Oxygen Demand 
(BOD), diminished BOD/COD ratio and elevated levels of toxicity. The impact of their discharges 
depends not only on biochemical oxyg en demand and the amount of suspended solids, but also on 
their content of specific inorganic and organic substances. In consequence, if they are directly 
disposed of to the nature, environmental hazards will arise from it. Thus, efficient remediation 
technologies have to be implemented to avoid environmental pollution . 
  Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
 
4 I.2 Methodologies Approaches to Wastewater Treatment  
The technologies applied in industrial effluents treatment can be categorized broadly as 
biological treatments, physical separation techniq ues, and chemical or advanced oxidation processes 
(AOPs). In many ocassions, combinations of processes have been proposed to improve the efficiency 
in the removal of contaminants or to reduce the size of equipment and consumption of chemicals 
(Pignatello et al.,  2006). Currently, a great number of the industrial wastewaters treatment plants 
encompass basically the same type of treatment schemes including suspended solids removal, 
homogenization and equalization tanks, neutralization steps, physical -chemical  processes as 
coagulation/flocullation and membrane filtration based systems, biological systems with activated 
sludge, sand filters and adsorption columns.  The most common scheme to treat wastewater drop into 
three stages: primary treatment, as grit remo val, grinding and sedimentation; secondary treatment, 
which uses oxidation of dissolved organic matter by means of biologically active sludge; tertiary 
treatment involving advanced techniques as polishing methods to achieve  the desirable values for 
the tr eatment purpose that can be disposal or reutilization.  
Regarding coagulation -flocculation, adsorption, foam flotation or membranes filtration, 
pollutants are transferred between phases originating subsequent wastes thus requiring additional 
treatment or d isposal, whereas biological and advanced oxidation chemical processes are desirable 
destructive methods. For real effluents employing sometimes more than one depurative technique is 
more beneficial. Decision about the selection of treatment methods is also  influenced by the 
intermediates formed during oxidization. These greatly differ for each treatment process due to the 
multitude of chemical reactions that are possible to occur. Therefore, the selection, design, and 
operation of such processes and their p ost-treatment methods should be carefully carried out for each 
particular effluent. The characteristics of chemical pollutants such as toxicity and biodegradability 
are normally changed and, therefore, suitable techniques should be opted for further cleani ng of the 
new products. Due to its accuracy, minimal analytical effort and short analysis time, COD, TOC and  
BOD 5/COD ratio are used as the main parameters to measure the effluent quality achieved by each 
process. Other parameters such as pH, total suspend ed solids and the toxicity level should also be 
evaluated . 
   
5 I.3 AOP s as an Effective Treatment Methodology   
Nowadays, biological processes are the preferred choice for wastewater treatment. They are 
relatively inexpensive and the running costs are low. Among them, the aerobic activated sludge 
processes are widely used as the main treatment that significantly reduces the COD.  On the other 
hand, anaerobic biodegradation only achieves partial COD removal, requiring a subsequent aerobic 
treatment to reach complet e degradation. However, those applications are not possible when the 
wastewaters are complex and contain bio recalcitrant compounds because of their resistance, 
inhibitory character or significant toxicity that inibthis the microorganism’s action. Thus, ch emical 
processes are an alternative when biological treatments are unable to decrease both toxicity and COD 
from industrial wastewater (Bautista et al., 2007; Li et al., 2009).  
Progresses in wastewater treatment technologies have been leading to better ef ficiencies. 
Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) (O 3, O 3/H2O2, O 3/UV, H 2O2/UV, O 3/H2O2/UV, H 2O2/Fe2+) 
are more reliable than conventional chemical oxidation processes that use potassium permanganate 
or chlorine, since AOPs have higher oxidation potential an d do not produce chlorinated by -products. 
Nevertheless, while these techniques revealed to have benefits regarding process yield, it is important 
to evaluate economical investment and treatment advantages when deciding if the application of a 
technology is  appropriate and cost effective.  
AOPs typically operate with less energy requirements than direct oxidation and have been 
proposed in the last years as powerful advanced technologies for the treatment of biorecalcitrant 
organic compounds, with a variety o f applications showing high degradation efficiencies (Azbar et 
al., 2003). However, for the development and application of these novel industrial processes it is 
necessary to consider numerous supplementary aspects, mainly economics (investment and 
operati onal costs), methodologies for the process efficiency assessment, implementation area, and 
automatic control as well. Thus, the process optimization and integration with less expensive 
technologies urge to be considered in order to increase their viability  and acceptance, thus lowering 
the operational and investment costs, which restrict their dissemination and implementation. In fact, 
complete mineralization by AOPs treatment may result in high costs, because the by -products formed 
during the oxidative tre atment are usually refractory to further oxidation by chemical means requiring 
harsher conditions (Hagman et al., 2008). Moreover, it must be also considered the combination of 
different AOPs which commonly causes the manifestation of attractive synergic e ffects that can 
considerably reduce the reaction time and the dosages of required reactants . Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
6 I.4 Motivation and Scope  
Currently, the remediation of industrial effluents is far away to have an adequate solution. 
Consequently, the increased public concern and p ressures from environmental non -governmental 
institutions as well as the adoption of common legislation with tighter international regulations 
endorses the demand for technical solutions and the application of environmental practices to reduce 
and mitigate  the environmental problems associated with the wastewaters. In this regard, advanced 
oxidation processes (AOPs) are well known efficient depuration methodologies; nevertheless, their 
current industrial application is still limited.  
As previously mentioned , the high cost derived from the use of AOPs can make attractive 
the possibility of coupling these effective technologies with less costly biological treatments. 
Nonetheless, from this point of view, it is necessary further advancement and understanding on  the 
utilization of these processes. In fact, in the case of low biodegradable compounds, the oxidation of 
organic compounds by AOPs usually produces oxygenated organic products and low molecular 
weight acids that are more amenable to microorganisms. With toxic compounds, the AOPs will be 
extended until the point that no biological inhibition due to toxicity will be observed. A new 
promising application urges with the integration of these oxidation methodologies with the traditional 
biological treatments, t aking the advantage of the potentialities of each one as a unique treatment 
system.   
In this context, the main goal of this Doctoral thesis is to explore new methodologies for the 
remediation of agro -industrial wastewaters by combining and integrating che mical and biological 
treatments. Due to this reason, the scope is to improve the understanding of homogeneous Fenton 
systems and ozonation applications to determine the factors that control the decomposition of organic 
compounds present in wastewaters by m eans of advanced oxidation promoted preferentially by 
hydroxyl radicals. This knowledge can help to increase the efficiency of Fenton’s and ozonation -
based treatment processes when applied to wastewaters. Furthermore, biodegradability evolution of 
the poll utant effluents will be analyzed in sequence to evaluate the viability of the integration with 
chemical -biological depuration processes .  I. INTRODUCTION   
 
7 I.5 Thesis organization  
This PhD thesis structure is a direct consequence from the performed work and the attained 
results  that permitted to write different papers published and/or submitted for publication in 
international journals, throughout the work carried out during the first two years in the Department 
of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Sciences and Technologie of the  University of Coimbra 
(FCTUC), and further at ADVENTECH (Advanced Environmental Technologies).  
The main goal of this thesis was the application of several treatment schemes mainly based 
on Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) to answer real existent needs  to treat several industrial 
wastewaters and determine the main operational conditions that favor these effluents remediation. 
To achieve this target, scientific knowledge is a remarkable contribution in increasing the treatments 
efficiency when applied to  different industrial wastewaters, as well as a more detailed understanding 
of the limitations and benefits of this kind of technologies will greatly help the selection of the 
effective treatments to be applied to each specific effluent.  
The thesis is stru ctured as a compilation of the research conduced in this project. The main 
studies comprise 7 papers that are published or submitted for publication. This work is divided in 
chapters including an Introduction, Stat -of-Art of the applied treatment technolog ies, Materials and 
Methods, Results and Discussion and finally the main Conclusions and Future Work.  
Chapter I considers a general introduction focused in the water problematic and in the 
treatment technologies that will be tested in this thesis. Emphasis  on the influence and preponderance 
of industrial wastewaters contribution to the environmental contamination burden will be given. This 
part also presents some parameters used to quantify the pollution levels. Moreover, a compilation 
with the descriptions  of the AOPs that are used for the treatment of industrial wastewaters is provided 
too. 
Chapter II presents a general introduction and review of the state -of-the-art focused in 
treatment technologies that will be tested in this thesis - the application of Advanced Oxidation 
Processes in the treatment of several wastewaters. In the first part, the current state -of-art of Ozone 
based and Fenton technologies in pollution abatement is provided through a survey of the technical 
principles and chemical mechanisms  involved in the oxidative processes. An approach to AOPs, 
which explains their fundamental principles and objectives, with a focus on the Fenton Homogeneous 
process, the ozonation and Perozonation processes will be referred. Afterwards, the fundamentals o f 
aerobic biological treatments in suspended sludge systems are described, as well as some concepts

8 processes integrated with biological oxidation and physico -chemical systems allow showing the 
dependency and complementarity between these different processes.  
The Materials and Methods are presented in Chapter III with a detailed description of 
methodologies and essential equipment used for their application, i ncluding chemical and biological 
assays.  At the final part, procedures and installations used to perform experimental trials are

wastewaters are discus sed in Chapter IV. It comprises seven developed works. The chapter begins 
with an overview of the various studies carried out with the Fenton oxidation, applied to treat olive 
mill, winery and elderberry wastewaters. In this regard, there was always the co mpromise of the final 
resultant treated water being able to be submitted to posterior biological treatment, even if discharged 
into a municipal wastewater treatment plant. Thereafter the work involving ozone based processes is 
described. This was used to t reat landfill leachate, chemical and carrot washing effluent and a 
wastewater from coating automotive electrics industry, emphasizing the major results and 
accomplished goals.  
Finally, the main conclusions drawn from the present work are summarized in Chap ter V 
and future research developments are proposed as well .

II.1 Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOP s) 
AOPs are defined as processes that generate highly reactive oxygen radicals. The “advanced” 
term is used due to the fact that the oxidation reactions  are accelerated when radical compounds enter 
the system. The result is the possible on -site total destruction of refractory organics without the 
generation of sludge or residues (Gogate and Pandit, 200 4b; Cañizares et al., 2007).  
 These treatment process es use the highly reactive, non -selective hydroxyl radical (HO•) as 
the primary oxidant in sufficient quantity to affect water purification, at near ambient temperature 
and pressure so that in many cases no more toxic compounds can be produced during the r eaction 
and complete organic matter mineralization can be achieved. After fluorine, the hydroxyl radical is 
the most powerful agent to oxidize and mineralize almost every organic molecule, yielding CO 2 and 
H2O and inorganic ions; Table II.1.1 shows the oxi dation potential of oxidizing agents used in water 
treatments.  
Table II.1.1 - Standard reduction potential of some oxidants in acidic media   (Pera -Titus et al., 2004)

 Hydrogen Peroxide (H 2O2) 1.77 
 Potassium Permanganate (KMnO 4) 1.67 
 Chlorine  1.36 
Bromine  1.09 
 
Due to their high standard reduction potential of 2.8 V in acidic media, the (HO•) radicals 
are able to oxidize almost all organic compounds except for some of the simplest organic compounds 
like the acetic acid, acetone or simple chloride derivatives as chloroform. These molecules are typical 
oxidation products of larger molecules (Poyatos et al., 2009). Thus, hydr oxyl radicals are able to 
partially remove the fraction of high molecular weight organics. This, usually improves wastewater 
biodegradability enhancing the possible application of a posterior bio -treatment (Bautista et al., 
2007; Li et al., 2009; Goi et al., 2009; Primo et al., 2008; Ntampou et al., 2006 ).  Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:

12 Radicals attack to the pollutants depends in the nature of the parent organic species:  
abstraction of a hydrogen atom in the case of alkanes and alcohols, electron transfer to hydroxyl 
radicals and addi tion to one atom of a multiple atom compound as it often happens with aromatic 
structures or olefins (Equations II.1 to II.3) (Azbar et al., 2004; Pignatello et al., 2006).

HO•+RX →RX•++OH−         (II.2)  
HO•+  →further reactions           (II.3)  
There are several AOPs that can be selected to degrade organic compounds. Their 
classification is often difficult and can be done within distinct aspects such as the mechanism 
followed for the production of radicals (chemica l, photochemical or electrochemical), the number of 
phases (homogeneous or heterogeneous), their cost or their efficiency among many others (Pera -
Titus et al., 2004; Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004). Among them, the most popular utilizations 
incorporate treatmen t with ozone (in homogeneous phase with single ozonation or combined with 
H2O2 and/or UV radiation and in heterogeneous phase in presence of solid catalysts), Fenton type 
reactions (such as Fenton, photo -Fenton, electro -Fenton or heterogeneous Fenton proce sses), and 
also H 2O2/UV systems and heterogeneous photo catalysis with TiO 2 (single or with H 2O2) (Poyatos 
et al., 2009).  
Fenton oxidation is an advanced oxidation technology in which a mixture of hydrogen 
peroxide and iron (II) salts is added directly to  the wastewater. Ozonation has been used for the non -
persistent disinfection of water. Fenton oxidation and ozonation have both been widely applied in 
lab scale studies for the treatment of model effluents. However, there is still lacking in literature 
works involving these interesting systems at a real scale for the abatement of the pollutant character 
of actual streams.  These processes are frequently able to diminish the COD down to the discharge 
limits set by authorities. However, in some cases these AOP s must be complemented with other 
techniques in order to achieve the final depuration level. This leads to a more complex process and 
to an increase in the global treatment cost .

13 Drawback factors that can affect the formation and concentration of hydrox yl radicals in 
water treatment include pH, natural organic matter (NOM) and alkalinity (Tuhkanen et al., 2004). 
NOM is hydroxyl radical scavenger  and alkalinity induces carbonate species (HCO 3- and CO 32-) that 
can also react with those radicals to produce  carbonate ion radicals (Pera -Titus et al., 2004; 
Tuhkanen, 2004; Ma et al., 2005) (Equations II.4 and II.5):  
HO•+HCO3−→CO3−•+H2O          (II.4)  
HO•+CO32−•→CO3−•+OH−          (II.5)  
However, even if the carbonate radicals can react with organic compounds the reaction is 
slower and more selective compared to the one with the hydroxyl radicals. Beyond th is, the carbonate 
radicals can also react with H 2O2 in aqueous medium (Equations II.6 e II.7) (Andreozzi et al., 1999; 
Pera-Titus et al., 2004; Ma et al., 2005).  
 HCO3 •+𝐻2𝑂2→HO2•+H2CO3       (II.6)  
CO3−•+HO2−→O2•+HCO3−         (II.7)  
In addition to the problems described, the water organic charge, in general expressed as COD 
(Chemical Oxygen Demand), can also become a limitation to the application of these technologies. 
Normally the wastewater that has COD values below 10 g.L-1 can be treated with these processes, 
but if the quantity of COD is high, the amount of reactant needed is very high, with negative effects 
on the treatment cost. Thus, generally, these processes must be envisaged as a step in the overall 
wastewate r treatment scheme that should, whenever possible, encompass biological oxidation. These 
integration strategies must be optimized to reach operating conditions able to properly treat the 
wastewater at the lowest cost.

14 II.2 Fenton and Fenton -Like Processes   
Fenton reaction was discovered by H.J.H. Fenton (Fenton, 1894) who observed that the 
utilization of hydrogen peroxide and iron salt as catalyst could oxidize various organic molecules. In 
1932, it was found that the mechanism of Fenton oxidation is based on the generation of hydroxyl 
radicals by the catalytic decomposition of the H 2O2 in acidic media (Haber and Weiss (1932)).  
 This technique reveals a particular interest since it can be held in normal temperature and 
pressure conditions, using easily to hand le reagents and involving short reaction times. Nowadays, 
the Fenton reaction is known to be a very efficient treatment process in the removal of many 
hazardous organics.  
II.2.1  Homogeneous Fenton Process  
The Fenton process generally involves four stages: pH adju stment, oxidation, neutralization, 
and coagulation / precipitation. This type of reaction is generally studied and used as a catalytic 
process based on the electron transfer between H 2O2 and a transition metal acting as a homogeneous 
catalyst, where the mo st common is ferrous salt (Gogate and Pandit, 200 4a, Guedes et al., 2003).  
 The mechanism of Fenton’s oxidation involves principally the steps described below in 
Equations (II.8 - II.10). The traditional accepted Fenton reaction implies the oxidation of f errous to 
ferric ions (Fe (II) to Fe (III)) to decompose hydrogen peroxide into hydroxyl radicals (HO•) and OH- 
(Neyens and Baeyesn, 200 3; Wang, 2008) : 
𝐹𝑒 (𝐼𝐼)+𝐻2𝑂2→𝐹𝑒 (𝐼𝐼𝐼)+ 𝑂𝐻−+HO•        (II.8)  
However, the generated Fe (III) in th e presence of excess hydrogen peroxide can be reduced 
and form  more radicals and again ferrous iron. This secondary process, designated as Fenton -like, is 
slower than the Fenton reaction, and permits Fe(II) regeneration in a cyclic mechanism (Equations 
II.8 and II.9) (de Laat et al., 2004). For this reason iron is added in small amounts while H 2O2 is 
continuously consumed . 
𝐹𝑒 (𝐼𝐼𝐼)+𝐻2𝑂2→𝐹𝑒 (𝐼𝐼)+ HO2•+𝐻+         (II.9)  
𝐹𝑒 (𝐼𝐼𝐼)+HO2•→𝐹𝑒 (𝐼𝐼)+O2+𝐻+                     (II.10)  
Equations II.9 and II.10 represent the rate -limiting step in the Fenton chemistry, as they are 
responsible for the regeneration of ferrous ions from the previously produced ferric ones. In fact, 
ferrous ion remains at a trace concentration, with approximately constant Fe (III) levels in solution. 
For this, the reaction rate is limited by the rate of (HO•) generatio n, which is directly related to the     II. STATE OF ART  
15 concentration of the iron catalyst (Neyens and Baeyesn, 200 3; Pignatello et al., 2006). The Fenton -
like process is slower than the Fenton one and, apart from ferrous ion regeneration, hydroperoxyl 
radicals (HO 2•) produce d are less powerful oxidants than hydroxyl ones.  
Equations II.11 - II.16 show other important reactions that can also take place during the 
Fenton process involving ferrous ion and radical reactions or hydrogen peroxide -radical reactions 
(Pera -Titus et al. , 2004; Neyens and Baeyens, 2003; Bautista et al.,  2008) . 
𝐹𝑒 (𝐼𝐼)+HO2•+H+ →Fe (III)+𝐻2𝑂2        (II.11) 
𝐹𝑒 (𝐼𝐼)+HO•+→Fe (III)+𝑂𝐻−       (II.12) 
𝐻2𝑂2+HO•→HO2•+𝐻2𝑂         (II.13)  
2 HO•→𝐻2𝑂2          (II.14)  
2 HO2•→𝐻2𝑂2+𝑂2         (II.15)  
HO2•+HO•→𝐻2𝑂+𝑂2        (II.16)  
The production of hydroxyl radicals occurs during the chain initiation reaction though they 
can be scavenged by ferrous ions, hydroperoxyl radicals and/or even auto scaveng ed. Besides, 
hydrogen peroxide may act both as radical generator and as scavenger (Pignatello et al., 2006) . 
2 𝐻2𝑂2→2 𝐻2𝑂+𝑂2         (II.17)  
The lack of any other molecule to be oxidized may lead to the decomposition of hydrogen 
peroxide t o molecular oxygen and wate r according to Equation II.17. However, even when an organic 
contaminant is present in solution this reaction can take place at some extent, meaning a waste of 
bulk oxidant (Pignatello et al., 2006) and thus an unnecessary increa se on the treatment costs.  
  Although the degradation rate of pollutants is accelerated with increased Fe2+ concentration 
(Equation II.8), excessive Fe2+  dosage only increases the degradation rate marginally and contributes 
to increase total dissolved sol ids  (Pera -Titus et al., 2004; Neyens and Baeyesn, 200 3; Bautista et al., 
2008). This can be referred as a disadvantage of this process since dissolved iron must be removed 
from solution prior to the effluent discharge . Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
16 II.2.2  Operating Conditions  
The main factors  that influence the performance of such complex reactive systems are the 
medium pH, the concentration of the initial iron species and the hydrogen peroxide dosage required 
for oxidation, as well as initial concentration of pollutants (Zhang et al., 2009; W u et al., 2011).  
In what concerns the solution pH, Fenton’s is strongly dependent mainly due to iron and 
hydrogen peroxide speciation factors (Neyens and Baeyens , 2003). The optimum pH of the reaction 
medium has been found to be from 2 to 4, described as a n optimum range for free radicals generation.  
The effect of pH on the Fenton process is complex. At pH values above 5, lower activity is 
detected due to the presence of inactive iron oxo -hydroxides or even the formation of iron (III) 
hydroxide complexes p recipitates. Accordingly, less free iron ions are accessible to hydrogen 
peroxide leading to a reduction of HO• radicals, decreasing also the oxidation process efficiency. In 
addition, the rapid H 2O2 decomposition and respective production of molecular oxy gen is carried out 
and less hydroxyl radicals are generated (De Laat et al.,  2004; Wu et al.,  2010).  
Lower pH’s can lead to a decrease on efficiency, frequently related with the effect over Fe 
III and hydrogen peroxide reactions. This is due to the format ion of iron (III) peroxocomplexes. 
Thus, at very low pH, Fenton reaction efficiency is decreased again due to iron speciation. At a pH 
below 2, the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by Fe2+ is inhibited; furthermore, the reaction chain 
of regeneration of Fe2+ is affected due to the formation of some complexes such as [Fe(H 2O)6]2+, 
which react slowly with peroxide, inhibithing the formation of HO• radicals. It may also occur the 
formation of stable oxonium ion [H 3O2]+ in the presence of high concentration o f H+ that enhances 
the peroxide electrophilic stability reducing substantially its reactivity with the Fe2+ ions (Gogate and 
Pandit, 200 4a; Schrank et al.,  2005).  
During the oxidation process, pH decreases, when the iron sulfate is added and after the 
introduction of hydrogen peroxide. This occurs partly due to the transformation of the initial organic 
material into organic acids. This pH change indicates that the reaction is going on in the preferred 
direction. An adequate control of pH could increase the oxidation efficiency. Nevertheless, the 
reaction buffering will always increase the operating costs in real applications. Consequently, final 
decision of whether or not using buffers will vary depending on each situation.  
 Another important factor that inf luences the efficiency of the Fenton oxidation process is 
the initial Fe (II) and hydrogen peroxide concentrations as well as the [H 2O2]: [Fe2+] ratio. The 
production of the desired hydroxyl radicals occurs through the above described initiation chain 
reaction. However, there is no agreement on the [H 2O2]: [Fe2+] ratio, since diverse authors have 
reported different ratios that lead to the best mineralization results. The ratio of hydrogen peroxide     II. STATE OF ART  
17 to ferrous iron [H 2O2]: [Fe2+]  and the ratio of hydrogen pe roxide to organic matter [H 2O2]: [COD] 
are key issues in the Fenton process that can greatly vary according to the type of pollutants and to 
the complexity of the wastewater matrix (Zhang et al., 2005; Gulkaya et al., 2006).  
Large excesses of either iron or hydrogen peroxide could be disadvantageous, as hydroxyl 
radicals can be scavenged by ferrous ions (Equation II.12), hydrogen peroxide (Equation II.13), 
hydroperoxyl radical (Equation II.16), and also auto -scavenged (Equation II.14).   It is also known 
that hydrogen peroxide may be active as radical generator and as scavenger or both in simultaneous 
(Gogate and Pandit, 200 4b; Namkung et al., 2008). On the other hand, a major catalyst dosage 
corresponds to more active Fe, accelerating the decomposition of H2O2, and in this case also more 
Fe ion are expected in the solution, leading to an increase in the number of hydroxyl radicals (Xu et 
al., 2009). Regarding the [H 2O2]: [Fe2+] ratio , when the value is low, ferrous iron can act as a 
coagulant in the presenc e of organic compounds, due to the generation of ferric hydroxo complexes, 
as well as the formation of ferric oxy -hydroxides after the neutralization stage promoting a higher 
removal efficiency through the coagulation step, showing that there are significa nt synergistic effects 
between oxidation and coagulation in the Fenton process (Martins et al., 2005 ; Wu et al.,  2011).  
Fenton reaction rate tends to increase when rising hydrogen peroxide concentration. Usually, 
the hydrogen peroxide dosage used is superi or to the stoichiometric one, since the consumption of 
H2O2 is not equivalent to the generation rate of hydroxyl radicals, once a part is decomposed into 
water and oxygen by non -radical pathways. There is a range where the increase in the H 2O2 
concentratio n improves COD removal; however there is a limit in hydrogen peroxide dose, above 
which the process performance does not improve and may even worsen (Pignatello et al., 2006). The 
reason for this is caused by hydroxyl radicals scavenging effect (Equation I I.13). For similar reasons 
it is believed that the use of high ferrous ion concentrations are appropriate for enhancing the 
production of HO•. Since hydrogen peroxide decomposes to yield (HO•) radicals, they generally react 
with ferrous ion and not with hy drogen peroxide in absence of organic matter (Schrank et al., 2005), 
due to the fact that the reaction between hydroxyl radicals and ferrous ions is faster than between 
HO• and H 2O2. The increase in the iron (catalyst) concentration favors the oxidation ra te and COD 
reduction. Consequently, the presence of organics affects the behavior of ferrous ions, because both 
compete for hydroxyl radicals (Pignatello et al., 2006).  
Some studies were performed to attempt to reduce hydrogen peroxide radical scavenger 
effect keeping its concentration at a low level. This has been carried out by periodically adding 
hydrogen peroxide to the Fenton reactor, decreasing the oxidant waste during the treatment. To avoid 
this competitive reactions, different dosing times of the reactants (continuous or by aliquots) could 
favor the process avoiding these scavenger effects, and also achieve higher removal efficiency and 
promote easiness of operation. (Wang et al., 2008; Martins et al.,  2010)  Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
18 The Fenton’s process has been used at r oom temperature and is rarely applied at higher 
temperatures, although the rate of Fenton reaction enhances when increasing the temperature. As the 
temperature increases above 40 - 50°C the efficiency of H 2O2 decreases due to the accelerated thermal 
decompo sition of hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water affecting thus the process performance.  
There is thus a cumbersome interaction between the parameters that affect the performance 
of Fenton’s process. Depending on the effluent depuration goals, different operating conditions 
should be employed to achieve the desired degradation efficiencies . 
II.2.3  Benefits and Limitations  
The Fenton process constitutes an attractive oxidative system that presents some advantages 
such as operation at room temperature and atmosphe ric pressure, use of non - expensive reagents and 
not requiring refined instrumentation (Bautista et al., 2007). Reagents, like iron, are available, easy 
to store and to handle, safe, nontoxic and they do not cause environmental damages (Pignatello et 
al., 2006). The hydrogen peroxide is not so expensive when compared with other oxidants and is also 
easy to handle without no environmental harmfulness. Apart from these benefits, no additional 
energy input is required to activate H 2O2, hence this is a cost eff ective method to generate HO• 
(Bautista et al.,  2007). At the end of the oxidation treatment by increasing the medium pH, the 
dissolved iron can be removed by precipitation, and consequently any residual H 2O2 decomposes into 
O2 and H 2O with improved  effici ency through coagulation, removing some organic matter at the 
same time that solid sludge is formed (Altinbas et al., 2003 ; Cañizares et al., 2007).  
 Nevertheless, various drawbacks can be identified. One of the most important is the 
operational cost asso ciated with the reagents consumption and problems such as corrosion of 
equipment (due to the acidic and alkaline conditions); inability to break down refractory chemicals 
are also pointed out as process limitations (Gogate and Pandit, 2004 a; Cañizares et al., 2007). Other 
related shortcomings are the necessity of buffering the pH for favorable operational conditions, the 
waste of oxidant due to the radical scavenger effect of hydrogen peroxide and its self -decomposition, 
as well as the adverse effect of exc essive H 2O2 dosage in the overall degradation of pollutants due to 
the reaction between HO• and excess H 2O2 (Gogate and Pandit 2004a ; Liao et al., 2009).  The 
continuous augmentation of iron ions dissolved in the treated effluent and the formation  of solid  
sludge after neutralization is a strong environmental weakness as well (Feng et al., 2003; Benatti et 
al., 2006; Bautista et al., 2007).  
 In consequence, the previously identified drawbacks can cause a significant economic and 
environmental impact. Besid es, recovery of iron ions and their following recycle and reuse has to be 
performed. Iron reusability has been typically carried by solid sludge or by supporting iron ions on     II. STATE OF ART

permit an efficient use of hydrogen peroxide as an effective oxidant agent.  
II.2.4  Applications to Wastewater Treatment  
Fenton’s reagent can be employed to treat a variety of organic pollutants present in 
wastewaters. And more especially furth er applications are becoming a fast growing field of applied 
research. Table II.2. 1 summarizes studies in literature regarding Fenton process for the purification 
of industrial waste waters by chronological order since 2003, and presents the operating cond itions 
and the main conclusions as well.  
Illustrative bench scale works that may be highlighted are the treatment of industrial 
wastewaters as tanning industry wastewaters (Schrank et al., 2005; Lofrano et al., 2007), phenolic 
compounds (Namkung et al., 2008; Martins et al., 2010a), paper pulp blenching effluents (Catalkaya 
and Kargi, 2007),  dy -containg textile effluents (Schrank et al., 2005; Gulkaya et al., 2006; Altinbas 
et al., 2003; Azbar et al., 2004; Fu et al.,  2010; Rodríguez et al., 2010; Shi -long et al.,  2009), 
pharmaceutical wastewater (Melero et al., 2007), cosmetic industry effluent (Bautista et al., 2007) 
fine chemical effluents (Cañizares et al., 2009),  chemical laboratory wastewaters (Benatti et 
al.,2006), detergents industries (Martins et al., 2011) complex industrial wastewater (Bianco et al., 
2011), pharmaceuticals and personal care effluent (Li et al., 2012). Trapido and collaborators (2006)  
have studied the application of Fenton’s to degrade semicoke oil leachate. The most representati ve 
use of this process involves landfill leachates treatment (Lopez et al. , 2004; Zhang et al.,  2005; Yang 
Deng, 2007; Goi et al., 2009; Gotvajn et al., 2009a; Wang et al., 2009; and Cortez et al.,  2011).  
On the other hand, several agro -industrial effluent s have been case studies, as wine -
distilleries (Cañizares et al., 2007 ; Martins et al., 2009 ; Martins et al., 2013) , black olive plants 
(Cañizares et al., 2009), cork cooking wastewater (Guedes et al., 2003), milk whey cheese production 
wastewaters (Marti ns et al., 2009), palm oil mill effluent (Aris et al., 2008) and one of the most 
studied wastewater, olive mill effluent (Nieto et al., 2007; Cañizares et al., 2009 ; Martins and Quinta 
Ferreira, 2011).  
In this context, the application of Homogeneous Fento n has been studied with promising 
results in the purification of effluents from dyeing (Schrank et al., 2005), featuring significant 
removals of chemical oxygen demand exceeding 90% (Gulkaya  et al., 2006) and up to 75% of total 
organic carbon decrease.  This process has actually been effective in the oxidation of landfill leachate 
with COD removal always above 50% (Wang et al., 2009 ; Goi et al., 2009) with  the enhancement 
of wastewater biodegradability.  Studies were conducted using this process for the trea tment of the 
effluents with broad chemical composition as the cosmetic industry and pharmaceutical wastewater Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
20 featuring COD and TOC removals of 70% and 75%, respectively (Melero et al., 2007), as well as in 
wastewater from industrial production of olive oi l and fine chemicals (Cañizares et al., 2007 and 
2009) demonstrating COD reductions above 70% for olive oil effluents. In the case of the effluents 
of cork cooking, 80% of COD abatement was possible (Guedes et al., 2003). Besides, interesting 
organic matte r removals were obtained for wastewaters from water -based paint (Kurt et al., 2006), 
olive mill effluent (Nieto et al., 2007), leather tanning industry (Lofrano et al., 2007), landfill 
leachate (Gotvajn et al., 2009), milk whey cheese production (Martins et al., 2010c) complex 
industrial wastewater (Bianco et al., 2011), usually also complemented with an increase in 
biodegradability.  
Importantly, is the fact that high efficiencies for a variety of effluents with distinct 
characteristics can be attained. Th is demonstrates how Fenton process can be an effective solution 
for the purification of agro -industrial effluents.

23 II.3 Ozonation  
Ozone (O 3) is an allotropic form of oxygen and it is a powerful oxidizing agent. Among the 
most common oxidizers, only hydroxyl and fluorine have higher oxidation potential. Its princ iple 
disinfectant action is known from a century ago as able to contribute to the mineralization of various 
organic and inorganic compounds. Thus, ozonation is an AOP, talented to produce hydroxyl radicals 
from the decomposition of ozone which is catalyzed  by hydroxide ions or initiated by the presence 
of traces of other substances, like transition metal cations (Lin et al., 2002). However, it was only 
during the last 30 years that its importance in water treatment has grown . 
II.3.1  Single Ozonation (O 3) 
Ozone is generally produced in situ by a high -voltage electric discharge in the presence of 
air or oxygen. It is a gas at normal temperature and pressure and its solubility in water depends on 
temperature, partial pressure in the gas phase and pH (Eckenfelder, 2000 ). Moreover, ozone is 
unstable and its rate of decomposition increases with temperature and pH. The chemistry implicated 
in the ozone formation is represented as follows (Equations II.18 and II.20) : 
𝑂2+ 𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦 →O•+ O•          (II.18)  
𝑂2+O•  →𝑂3          (II.19)  
The reaction mechanism between ozone and dissolved organic substances has been described 
by innumerous authors. Ozone can react with the organic load present in the wastewater  by two 
possible pathways of oxidation in water depending on the pH (Gunten, 2003; Moussavi et al., 2009). 
The combination of both pathways for degradation of compounds depends on their nature (Gogate 
and Pandit, 2004a; Pera -Titus et al., 2004).  
The direct  pathway takes place at low pH, it is slow and highly selective on the electrophilc 
attack of the high electronic density positions through the reaction between ozone and the dissolved 
compounds, and usually occurs by means of the ozonation of multiple bon ds or in nucleophilic 
centers (Kasprzyk -Hordern et al., 2003), Equation II.20 .  
𝑂3+Organic Compounds    →Organic Compounds ox+ Byproducts   (II.20)  
The radical pathway, indirect type, occurs through the reaction of hydroxyl radicals, a more 
effective o xidant compared to ozone, generated from ozone decomposition. This mechanism can be 
favored in a basic environment (pH >8), where hydroxide ions (OH-) start ozone decomposition. 
(Gunten, 2003; Chandrasekara et al.,  2009). The ozone molecules are decomposed  into free radicals Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
24 (O2-• and H 2O•), and subsequently produce hydroxyl radicals, which will attack organic compounds. 
Radicals are nonselective and promote very powerful chain reactions, which can lead to organic 
compounds mineralization. Therefore, ozonat ion is more efficient when the conditions favor H O• 
production (Kasprzyk -Hordern et al., 2003; Pera -Titus et al., 2004 ; Ikehata and El -Din, 2004).  
The reactions of ozone with hydroxide (II.21) and hydroperoxide ions (II.22) initiate the 
ozone decompositio n chain mechanism : 
𝑂3+OH−  →𝐻𝑂2−+𝑂2        (II.21)  
𝑂3+𝐻𝑂2−  →HO2•+𝑂2−•        (II.22)  
The next stage is the reaction between ozone and the superoxide radical (O 2-•) a major agent 
of the propagation of ozone decomposition, producing the desir able hydroxyl radical (Equation s II.23 
at II.27) : 
HO2•↔𝑂2−•+H+         (II.23)  
𝑂2  −•+𝑂3→𝑂3  −•+𝑂2        (II.24)  
𝑂3  −•+H+↔HO3•         (II.25)  
HO3•→HO•+𝑂2          (II.25)  
 HO•+𝑂3 →HO2•+𝑂2        (II.27)  
The complex reaction system is maintained by the promoters which are all molecules capable 
of transforming hydroxyl radicals into superoxide radicals. At the end, ozone decomposition 
reactions can be finished when hydroxyl radicals react with compo unds capable of consuming HO• 
radicals (inhibitors), without regeneration of the superoxide radical. Moreover,  the above mentioned 
hydroxyl radical scavengers may also limit or inhibit the oxidation of the target compounds by these 
radicals (Kasprzyk -Hord ern et al., 2003; Pera -Titus et al., 2004; Chandrasekara et al., 2009).  
To summarize, in the ozonation process there are two possible pathways to be considered: 
the reactions with molecular ozone (direct pathway), and the reactions with hydroxyl radicals 
produced by ozone decomposition (radical pathway) (Liotta et al., 2009; Pirgalıoglu and Özbelge, 
2009). Basic pH causes an increase of ozone decomposition. Both pathways are able to oxidize the 
organic compounds prevailing one or the other depending mainly on the medium pH, but also on the 
wastewater composition and ozon e dosage ( Alvares et al., 2001 ) as presented in Figure  II.3.1 .

organic products, Si= radical scavenger species (Alvares et al., 2001 ) 
II.3.2  Ozon e + Hydrogen Peroxide (O 3/H2O2)  
Unless pH is increased, ozonation does not produce enough (HO•)  radical concentration in 
order to completely mineralize dissolved pollutants; specially organic compounds having a high 
molecular weight usually lead to small  compounds which are refractory to further reaction with 
ozone. Another way to increase the production of hydroxyl radicals is through the addition of 
hydrogen peroxide into the ozonation reactor (Gunten, 2003; Azbar et al., 2004; Poyatos et al., 2009).  
This combined system can initiate the decomposition cycle of ozone, resulting in the 
formation of the desired hydroxyl radicals. In aqueous medium, hydrogen peroxide is  partially 
dissociated in ionic species (HO 2-), which react with ozone, that is decompose d  and origins a chain 
reactions scheme (Gunten, 2003; Gogate and Pandit, 2004b; Qiang et al., 2010). By that, both 
radicals are formed and will degrade more effectively the pollutants. The initiation stage is shown by 
Equation (II.28) :  
𝑂3+HO2−→HO2•+𝑂3•        (II.28)  
And, the global reaction that takes place is present in Equation II.29 :  
2 𝑂3+𝐻2𝑂2→3 𝑂2+2HO•        (II.29)  
Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
26 This combined system benefits from synergistic effects, leading to superior conversion yields 
than thos e of single ozonation. It is reported that the process can be used to treat pollutants in very 
low concentrations, at pH values between 7 and 8, and the optimum H 2O2/O3 mass ratio is from 0.35 
to 0.5 (Gogate and Pandit, 200 4b; Gunten, 2003; Hagman et al., 2008). Nevertheless, the best 
performance was achieved when H 2O2 was added after the oxidation of highly reactive substances 
by single ozonation (Qiang et al., 2010); this entails lower operational costs since hydrogen peroxide 
will be only added in a seco nd stage aiming the degradation of the saturated by -products which are 
no further reactive with molecular ozone. In this line, Matilainen and Sillanpää (2010) concluded 
that ozonation followed by perozonation is the best sequence for DOC (Dissolved Organic  Carbon) 
abatement when compared with the reverse methodology.  
However, the increased concentration of hydrogen peroxide, enhances the degradation rate 
until a load limit that inhibits the reaction, related with a scavenger effect, because there is a 
consu mption of hydroxyl radicals by H 2O2 in excess, Equation II.30 : 
𝐻2𝑂2+HO•→HO2•+𝐻2𝑂        (II.30)  
The implementation of this radical system makes degradation of refractory molecules 
possible, combining the advantages of selective molecular oz one reactions and posterior non -
selective free radical attack reactions (Gogate and Pandit, 2004b; Azbar et al., 2004) . 
II.3.3  Operating Conditions  
In ozonation, what affects more the process efficiency is the dependence of each mechanism 
pathway on several facto rs principally the pH but also the temperature and chemical composition of 
the aqueous solution.  
Therefore, ozone decomposition rate is highly dependent upon the pH of the wastewater and 
on the nature of the pollutants. In general, under acidic conditions  (pH < 4) the direct pathway rules, 
whereas for pH > 10 is mainly the radical (Kasprzyk -Hordern et al., 2003). Under neutral conditions, 
both mechanisms can be important and should always be considered when designing a treatment 
system. However, excessive high pH values may favor the hydroxyl radicals scavenging by carbonate 
and hydrogen carbonate ions, which  compete with the substrate by the HO• radicals, as described 
above for Fenton type reactions.   
Normally, like as other AOPs, ozonation operates at r oom temperature. However, the 
temperature variation may origin distinct effects. If, on one hand it increases the reactions rate     II. STATE OF ART  
27 constants, on the other hand, ozone solubility drops off reducing the ozone available for the oxidation 
process (Alvares et al. , 2001).  
Ozone processes can be more efficient at high pH (O 3/OH−) and by the addition of hydrogen 
peroxide (O 3/H2O2). These systems favor the production of hydroxyl radicals (HO•), which are highly 
reactive species. OH−and H 2O2 initiate a series of radical reactions that enhance ozone decomposition 
to yield HO•. In th e system O 3/OH−, the hydroxide ion reacts with ozone to yield superoxide anion 
radicals (O 2−•), which in their turn are involved in a series of reactions that yield HO•. In the system 
O3/H2O2, when hydrogen peroxide is dissolved in water, it partially diss ociates into hydroperoxide 
ion (HO 2−, the conjugated base of hydrogen peroxide), which reacts rapidly with ozone to initiate a 
radical chain mechanism that leads to hydroxyl radicals. In this case, overall 1 mol of O 3 yields 1 
mol of HO•. Ozonation has bee n used for the most diverse applications such as disinfection, odor, 
color and taste abstraction, oxidation of inorganic and organic compounds which enables particle 
removal (Sangave et al., 2007).  
For the perozone (ozone + hydrogen peroxide) the ozonatio n efficiency is enhanced by this 
combination; nevertheless the H 2O2 excess may have a scavenging comportment on the generated 
radical hydroxyls, and a less reactive radical is also formed, the hydroperoxyl radical (Chandrasekara 
et al., 2009).   
II.3.4  Benefits a nd Limitations  
Ozone has the main advantage of leading to an efficient and quick removal of several 
pollutants. The demonstrated strong oxidant power permits to reach the mineralization of 
wastewaters when other classical treatments are inefficient. Residu al ozone quickly decomposes not  
adding new species in the resultant treated wastewater. However, the oxidation can form by -products, 
which cannot be easily oxidized by ozone molecules, such as organic acids and ketones.  
Ozone is also produced in situ, not being possible to store or transport. Besides, ozone 
generation requires a large quantity of chemical reagents (O 2 or air) and electrical power. The energy 
cost associated to the oxidant production requires then a careful analysis of the influence of ozone  
concentration at the reactor entrance (Rosal et al., 2009; Klavarioti et al., 2009). The maximum 
reached concentrations of ozone a re approximately 4 and 8% (w/w) when produced from air or pure 
oxygen respectively.  Other limitation is the instability of o zone in aqueous medium and depending 
on the water quality and turbidity ozone half -time can be within a large range of values between 
seconds and hours (Gunten, 2003; Kasprzyk -Hordern et al., 2003).  Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
28  Another important restriction is the low solubility of o zone in aqueous medium being th e 
gas-liquid mass transfer the major constraint of the ozonation process (Pirgalıoglu and Özbelge, 
2009). This limiting factor can be reduced by maximizing the interfacial contact area, through the 
utilization of small pore size ozone diffusers that reduce  the bubble size, or by increasing the contact 
time between the gas and the liquid medium in large bubble columns (Andreozzi et al., 1999).  
The utilization of ozone based technics is very limited when applied in wastewaters with 
TSS (total suspended solids ) content, due to the existent limitation of ozone transfer caused by the 
solid content achieving this way a very low percentage of solids removal; additionaly, COD content 
may increase due to the solubilization of the solid fraction (Campos et al., 2009; Rivas et al., 2009). 
However, this aspect can be encouraging for smaller solids which before the ozone oxidation could 
not be assimilated / oxidized biologically, and that subsequently to the ozone based process are 
solubilized / reduced to a scale that ca n be oxidized biologically (Wang et al., 2008) increasing the 
effluent biodegradability.  
Finally, the global analysis towards decision if industrial application will be advantageous 
has to involve the initial investment integrating the high capitals costs  related to the process 
equipment, as the ozone generator, construction materials that must be resistant to oxidation and 
abatement system for residual ozone; special attention must be given to the gas -liquid transfer 
limitations (Andreozzi et al., 1999) . 
II.3.5  Applications to Wastewater Treatment  
Throughout the last years, literature is full with successful applications of ozonation on a wide 
range of contaminant compounds in wastewaters .  
II.3.5.1  Single Ozonation  
The study of ozonation for real wastewater tre atment has been neglected over the years, now 
beginning to be of global interest the application of this methodology for the purification of several 
watercourses with diverse characterizations. Ozone is assumed as an oxidizing agent with a high 
potential f or cleansing of both drinking water and effluents from chemical production showing 
efficiencies above 80%.  Table II.3.1 summarizes studies in the literature involving the analysis of 
the process of ozonation in the treatment of industrial wastewater and re port the main conclusions.  
 In this context, the use of ozone has been addressed for the oxidation of various effluents, 
with promising results in the degradation of landfill leachate (Chaturapruek et al., 2005; Ntampou et 
al., 2006; Goi et al., 2009 and T izaoui et al., 2007) with considerable depletion of COD and Color,     II. STATE OF ART  
29 with the advantage of achieving a biodegradability enhancement. The application of ozonation for 
the treatment of a semi -coke leachate from petrochemical industry is reported (Trapido et al., 2006) 
with a COD removal of 56% and the improvement of wastewater biodegradability to 0.59.  
Phenol is one of the most studied compounds as model for phenolic wastewaters, and our 
previous research in this ambit revealed 88% removal of total phenol cont ent and 24% of TOC 
depletion (Martins and Quinta -Ferreira, 2011) as also referred by Wu and collaborators (2004).  
Other type of pollutants usually studied are the dyes (Azbar et al., 2004; Tapalad et al., 2008; Dong 
et al., 2007; Faria et al., 2008 and Al tinbas et al., 2003). Single ozonation proved to be an interesting 
technology in the remediation of these pollutants with a global color removal around 80% and COD 
diminution above 80% except on the treatment of red X3 -B. 
 In what regards chemical effluent s, a wide range of applications are referred such as 
production of terephthalic acid (PTA) (Chandrasekar et al., 2009), sulfosalicylic acid (SSal) (Ping et 
al., 2002), alachlor (Qiang et al., 2010) and fine chemical production (Cañizares et al., 2009) wher e 
TOC removals around 80% and considerable COD depletion were achieved.  
Ozonation was also studied in agriculture production wastewaters as winery wastewater with 
COD removals upper than 50% (Martins et al., 2009 and Lucas et al., 2010), olive oil producti on 
(Cañizares et al., 2007 and 2009), elderberry wastewater where complete Total Phenol content 
removal was achieved (Martins et al., 2012), milk whey with a remarkable BOD 5/COD improvement 
to 0.8 (Martins et al., 2010) and cork -processing water (Lan et al., 2008).  
Other production industry studies focusing the implementation of ozonation in the treatment 
of wastewaters derived from paper mills (Alvárez et al., 2009; Catalkaya and Kargi, 2007 and Tünay 
et al., 2008). Tannery industry (Preethi et al., 2009) and baker’s yeast industry (Altinbas et al., 2003) 
wastewaters are also reported in the literature.   
Great part of the referred works concluded that ozone based processes could be beneficial to 
remove the organic content but above all, diminish the latent toxicity from the wastewater, when 
applied prior to biological treatment (Lucas et al., 2010 ; Martins et al., 2011) .  Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:

Perozone was recently applied for the depuration of several types of wastewater as it is shown 
in Table II. .3.2 such as landfill leachate (Tizaoui et al., 2007; Hagman et al., 2008; Gotvajn et al.,  
2009b and Cortez et al.  2011), pulp and paper wastewater (Catalkaya and Kargi, 2007 ; Tünay et al., 
2008). Two Agro Industrial wastewaters were also object of study as Milk Whey (Martins et al., 
2010) and Elderberry (Martins et al., 2012). Also the depurat ion of secondary effluent from 
municipal wastewater (Rivas et al., 2009) was analysed. With this proper treatment, COD reductions 
between 50 and 80% and color removal of 98% were achieved as well as improved biodegradability 
of a landfill leachate. Total C OD was depleted on the treatment of Milk Whey. Besides TP (Total 
Phenol ) and  COD achi eved a removal of 100 and 61% for Elderberry wastewater. This type of 
enhanced ozone based oxidation was often compared with the simple ozonation, showing in turn that 
achieves better removals, but not always cost/effective .

33 II.4 Coagulation / Flocculation  
In wastewater treatments, the coagulation process is use d to improve solids removal, thus 
enhancing COD and inorganic content removal. Simultaneously, the effectiveness of all the 
processes upstream will be enhanced, by increasing the homogeneity of the medium and promoting 
organic charge stabilization. Besides , this process usually leads to higher biodegradability (Mert et 
al., 2010), along with toxicity and color removal (Kumar et al., 2011), thereby favoring the biological 
oxidative processes (Sarika et al., 2005), as well as chemical degradation processes as  AOPs. Thus 
this is an essential and cost effective process for water and industrial wastewaters treatment 
(Barbusinski and Pieczykolan, 2010 ; Sahu and Chaudhari, 2013 ; Upadhyay and Mistry, 2012;  
Chauhan and Dikshit, 2012).  
Often the terms coagulation and  flocculation are used synonymously in spite of existing a 
subtle difference between them. Coagulation consists in the process where charge neutralization 
results in the particles destabilization, while the term flocculation is used to designate the proces s 
that promotes the formation of particles in suspension into larger agglomerates from small 
agglomerates. These are formed as a result of coagulation using high molecular weight polymeric 
materials, through the collision of the destabilized particles by c oagulant interaction (Sarika et al., 
2005 ; Farajnezhad and Gharbani, 2012).  
In this section the issues related to the implementation of the coagulation process employed 
as pre -treatment in the experimental studies will be addressed . 
II.4.1  Coagulation  
Coagulatio n is an essential component in water and wastewater treatment operations (Liang 
et al., 2009). Colloidal particles existing in wastewater usually carry negative charges on their 
surface, which leads to the stabilization of the suspension. The process invol ves reactions between 
the organic molecules of the effluent and the coagulants, which impose changes in the surface 
properties of those colloidal particles inducing their destabilization through charge neutralization, 
due to the fact that they possess posi tive charges (cationic). This way, they interact with an electrical 
double layer of ions and the resulting negative zeta potential (is related to the surface charge, a 
property that all materials possess, or acquire, when suspended in a fluid.) promotes th e absence of 
repulsive forces between the colloidal particles, which become destabilized and begin to clump 
together, inducing the precipitation of the dissolved material. The numerous successful colloid 
collisions origin micro flocs and their growth into visible flocs facilitating the separation of solids by 
gravity (Sher et al., 2013). If high dosages of coagulants are added, the concentration of the colloids Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
34 ions in the diffuse layer may increase to a level that the zeta potential shifts to a positive ch arge. The 
particles will be then positively charged and will become again colloidal stable in suspension (Jiang 
and Wang, 2009; Aygun and Yilmaz, 2010), promoting a reverse effect that was expected.  
II.4.1.1  Coagulation (fundamentals)  
Among the various applicatio ns and performed studies, several fundamental theories have 
been presented that allowed the identification of certain mechanisms for providing the destabilization 
of particles that depend on the nature of the interactions between the chemical coagulants an d 
pollutants. There are four referred mechanisms for coagulation, namely adsorption charge 
neutralization, sweep coagulation, layer compression, and inter particle bridging (Eckenfelder, 2000; 
Hendricks, 2013) . The predominant observed mechanisms during co nventional coagulation with 
metal coagulants are adsorption charge neutralization and sweep coagulation (Liang et al., 2009; 
Tzoupanos and Zouboulis, 2008; Jiang and Wang, 2009).  
II.4.1.1.1  Adsorption charge neutralization  
Adsorption charge neutralization coagulati on is the most important process when metal salts 
are applied. An increase in the electrolyte concentration, when adding the metal salts, endorse counter 
ions present in the diffuse part of the electrical double layer in the stable colloidal suspension, wh ich 
origins the particles destabilization. In this way, the exterior of the colloidal particle is destabilized 
and collide with other particles creating removable flocs.  
II.4.1.1.2  Precipitation coagulation (or sweep coagulation)  
Depending on the amount of coagulan t added, the mixture pH, and the concentration of some 
types of colloids in water, metallic hydroxides precipitates may be formed. When the coagulant is 
added at higher dosages and at relative high pH, the primary coagulation mechanism tends first to 
the formation of metal hydroxide precipitates, followed by the adsorption of the remaining colloid 
particles in solution or co -precipitation favoring the entrapment (Amir et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2012). 
In this case, precipitates form “sweep flocs” that tend t o drag particles by coagulant metal -hydroxides 
as it settles out of suspension (Tzoupanos and Zouboulis, 2008). Precipitation coagulation is the most 
widely used where there is flocculation and sedimentation, due to the higher pH range coverage, also 
leadi ng to easiness of operation. This mechanism favors the turbidity removal when metal salts are 
added (Liu et al., 2012), through the formation of stable hydroxides and the entrapment of a 
considerate amount of colloids inside the “net structure” of the hydr oxides  
     II. STATE OF ART  
35 II.4.1.1.3  Adsorptive coagulation  
The process of adsorptive coagulation is defined as the destabilization of the colloids in 
solution by adsorption of long hydroxide chains promoted by the pH variations at alkaline conditions, 
on the oxidized particle surfa ce. In the adsorption mechanism and charge neutralization after the 
addition of coagulant, the hydrolysis of metal ions occurs with subsequent adsorption of hydrolyzed 
species, usually positive charged, on the surface of the colloids leading to a destabili zation.  The 
adsorption is caused by mutual attraction of opposite charge and/or Van der Waals‘mass force.  
II.4.1.1.4  Inter particle bridging  
A special type of adsorptive coagulation is entitled as bridging flocculation. In bridging 
flocculation, adsorption mechanis m and bridge formation is due to the addition of natural or synthetic 
polymers as coagulants. When the coagulating agent comes into contact with a colloidal particle it 
adsorbs some of its reactive groups causing their destabilization in both particles. In  turn, the free 
segments of the polymers of the previously disrupted particles are adsorbed on the surface of another 
particle, promoting their aggregation.  
II.4.1.2  Types of coagulants  
The most common chemicals applied as coagulants are aluminum and iron salts, as 
aluminum sulphate (referred to as alum), ferrous sulphate, ferric sulfate, ferric chloride (Tatsi et al. 
2003), although alkalis lime (CaO), as well as hydrated lime are also used as coagulants (Chauhan et 
al., 2012; Santo et al., 2012) that additionall y are employed to promote and maintain the alkalinity, 
thus improving the process (Ismail et al., 2012).  
When metal coagulants are added to water, the metal ions hydrolyze quickly, developing a 
series of metal hydrolysis species (Labanowski et al., 2010).  These species are dependent mainly on 
pH, coagulant dosage (Aygun and Yilmaz, 2010) and mixing level. However, aluminum and ferric 
coagulants can be used to generate inorganic polymeric coagulants. These coagulants are typically 
generated by partially neu tralizing concentrated solutions of aluminum or ferric with a base such as 
sodium hydroxide prior to their use in the coagulation process. The principal advantages of pre -
polymerized inorganic coagulants are that they are able to function efficiently over wide ranges of 
pH and raw water temperatures (Lofrano et al., 2006). They are less sensitive to low water 
temperatures, and since lower dosages are required (Liu et al., 2012) consequently less chemical 
residues are produced. This way, lower chloride, sulf ate and metals loads will lead to lower final 
TDS concentration (Tzoupanos and Zouboulis, 2008).  Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
36 II.4.1.3   Types of flocculants  
Polymers are synthetic or natural organic compounds that tend to be large molecules 
composed of chains of smaller “monomer” groups and ar e often used in combination with other 
coagulants such as aluminum or ferric chloride to optimize solids removal. Because of their large 
size and charge characteristics, polymers can promote destabilization through bridging, charge 
neutralization, or both (Brostow et al., 2009).  
The organic polymers frequently used in wastewater treatment are cationic (positively 
charged), anionic (negatively charged), or nonionic (neutrally charged) and are categorized into two 
major types: very high molecular weight poly acrylamides (PAMs) flocculants with different active 
groups, which may be anionic, cationic or nonionic or low to mid molecular weight cationic 
floculants based on (non -) quaternised dimethylamine (polyamines) and diallyldimethyl ammonium 
chlorides (DADMAC s) (Tripathy and Ranjan, 2006).  
Due to their length, the polymer chains are able to attach to different particles. An important 
characteristic of flocculation, is that lower electrolyte additions are need to promote  destabilization 
by bridging/patching mec hanisms, acting as a coagulant, achieving the propososed suspended 
particles removal (Metcalf and Eddy, 2004).  
II.4.2  Operating Conditions  
The foremost issues that influence the performance of coagulation systems are the raw water 
characteristics, temperature, pH  and alkalinity, the type and concentration of the coagulant, as well 
as the mixture velocity gradient and mixing time (Ismail et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2009; Santo et al., 
2012). Coagulant selection and optimal dosages are critical to process efficiency ( Ginos et al., 2006). 
Maintaining or not proper control of these chemicals can mean the difference between an optimized 
or inefficient treatment, being need the adjustment of coagulant dosages at intervals to achieve 
optimal coagulation during the process d ue to the water characteristics changing. In this way the 
required concentration of coagulant is related with the concentration of organic matter and ionic 
species, pH, temperature, among others factors.  (Ntampou et al. , 2006; Dihang et al., 2008; Sher et 
al., 2013 ; Santo et al., 2012). When a lower coagulant dosage is needed and the preferable 
mechanism is the destabilization through charge neutralization and not sweep floc development, the 
mixing should occur faster because chemical reactions could happe n very quickly at low dosages 
(Aygun and Yilmaz, 2010 ; Papaphilippou et al., 2013). At higher dosages, the primary coagulation 
mechanism tends to be entrapment, the inorganic coagulant precipitates forming a “sweep floc” that 
tends to capture suspended sol ids as it settles out of suspension (Liang et al., 2009; Amir et al., 2009).      II. STATE OF ART  
37  It is extremely important that the coagulant is dispersed quickly and efficiently because the 
destabilizing agents are the intermediate products of the coagulant reaction. These intermediates are 
short -lived and they must contact the solids particles (Jiang and Wang, 2009). In some cases, 
excessive mixing may serve to break up coagulant molecules or floc particles, thus reducing the 
efficacy of the solids removal processes (Ismail  et al.,  2012). With increase in pH, these species 
become charged and the mechanism of action changes. By this, the hydroxide precipitation, induced 
by the pH change, leads to the possibility of potentiate the sweep flocculation mechanism (Aygun 
and Yilmaz , 2010). Water pH plays an important role because the solubility of the aluminum and 
iron species is pH dependent (Moghaddam et al., 2010).  
Alkalinity refers to the acid -neutralizing ability of the wastewater, being a general indicator 
of buffering capacit y. There is a direct relationship between this parameter and pH, as high alkalinity 
wastewaters have a higher pH.  As the metallic coagulants are acidic, the coagulant addition will 
consume the alkalinity which may lead to pH decrease into values that will  diminish the process 
efficiency (Ntampou et al., 2006; Liang et al., 2009).  In contrast, water with high alkalinity might 
require higher coagulants doses to depress the pH to values favorable for coagulation (Barbusinski 
and Pieczykolan, 2010; Kumar et al., 2011). Other factor that is important is the temperature, due to 
the fact that it affects the viscosity of the water changing thus the coagulant solubility. Lower 
temperature waters can decrease the hydrolysis and precipitation kinetics promoting more irregular 
and less compact flocs (Xiao et al., 2009 ).  
Conventionally, the arrangement of chemical addition for coagulation processes demands 
first the pH correction, then the metal coagulant addition, and finally the flocculant introduction 
(Zemmouri et al., 2012). However, there are instances where other sequences are more effective, 
including inverting the sequence of metal coagulant and polymer addition, and the sequence of metal 
coagulant addition and pH adjustment .  
II.4.3  Benefits and Limitations  
As one of the most applied treatment processes to wastewater depuration, coagulation/ 
flocculation treatment has some advantages and limitations. Advantages are based on the fact that it 
is a simple treatment, involving a well -known procedure, has a multiplicity of different systems to 
be employed in a variety of treatments, including both potable water and wastewater, with well -
developed equipment and control systems. All this makes its implementation to be greatly easy in 
the most diverse sectors (Moghaddam et al.,  2010).  In addition, this process not only produces 
coagulation of colloids but also typically results in the precipitation of soluble compounds, such as 
phosphates (Tassoula et al., 2007; Tatsi et al., 2003). Furthermore, coagulation can also  lead to th e Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
38 removal of particles larger than colloids due to the entrapment of such particles in the flocs formed 
during coagulation, enhancing primary treatment to reduce suspended solids, organic loads (Aygun 
and Yilmaz, 2010), and also some hazardous metals as ch romium (Lofrano et al., 2006).  
The advantage of organic polymers is that they are more effective at small dosages, and the 
combination of flocculants with coagulants enhances the floc -settling rate (Tatsi et al., 2003; Ginos 
et al., 2006) and improve proce ss economics as well (Sarika et al., 2005). Natural polymers are also 
biodegradableand are stable for different operational conditions (Brostow et al., 2009). Even though 
they may be more expensive, a smaller amount may be needed, thereby saving money in t he 
coagulation/flocculation process.  
However, the inherent disadvantage to this process is the generation of large quantities of 
chemical sludge that depend on the type of coagulant as well as of the operation conditions (Tatsi et 
al., 2003; Ginos et al.,  2006; Kestioglu, 2005). If its classification is hazardous waste, there is the 
need for secured land filling adequate to hazardous solid wastes (Moghaddam et al.,  2010). The 
process also increases the total dissolved salt (total dissolved solids) (Barbusi nski and Pieczykolan, 
2010; Liang et al., 2009 ; Liu et al., 2012; Zemmouri et al., 2012).  
As stated, if there is a surplus of coagulant dosage it can favor a decrease in the removal 
efficiency possibly due to partial re -stabilization of colloids (Mavros et al., 2008).  Other limitation 
is the susceptibility  of the process efficiency due to changes in wastewater matrix variance (type and 
concentration of pollutants, pH, TDS) (Sun et al., 2009). Different conditions may lead to the need 
of readjusting the co agulation conditions (Moghaddam et al., 2010; Aboulhassan et al., 2006) .

39 II.4.4  Applications to Wastewater Treatment  
The coagulation process has been employed for many years for a wide diversity of 
wastewaters. Table II.4.1 presents studies for treatment of i ndustrials wastewaters, showing the 
operational conditions and the attained efficiencies.   
Petroleum wastewater treatment was evaluated by this chemical/physical process 
(Farajnezhad, and Gharbani, 2012, Santo et al., 2012), as well as tannery leather wast ewater (Lofrano 
et al., 2006), Pulp and paper (Kumar et al., 2011), microelectronic factory wastewater (Aboulhassan, 
et al., 2006), municipal wastewater (Ismail et al. , 2012), detergents wastewater (Aygun and Yilmaz, 
2010) and industrial polymer effluent ( Sher et al., 2013).  
Part of the presented works are the result of developed studies where coagulation was applied 
as pre or post treatment of wastewaters, being a complementary process of integrated schemes of 
multiple depurative stages. This is the case o f the treatment of olive oil mill effluents which has been 
integrated with Fenton, (Gino al., 2006; Rizzo et al., 2008 ; Mert et al., 2010), Photo -Fenton (Rizzo 
et al., 2008; Papaphilippou et al., 2013) with Ozonolysis (Ntampou et al., 2006 and Lafi et al.,  2010), 
anaerobic digestion (Pekin et al., 2010), H 2O2 / UV and UV / O 3 (Kestioglu et al., 2005). In the case 
of treating landfill leachates flocculation was integrated with Ozonolysis (Ntampou et al.,  2006) and 
for the wastewater treatment of mollases coa gulation was applied after an aerobic biological 
treatment (Liang et al., 2009). Coagulation used as pretreatment can effectively remove organic and 
inorganic matter enhancing the subsequent treatment based on advanced oxidation processes (Wu et 
al., 2004) . 
From this perspective, the utilization of coagulation/flocculation processes, reveals 
promising results when integrated with AOPs treatments of olive mills effluents,  leading to 
substantial removals of chemical oxygen demand as 90%, 95% and 94%, for O 3, O3/UV and 
H2O2/UV processes (Lafi et al., 2010; Mert et al., 2010).  In another work, COD removal range was 
about 10 -40% after coagulation and the degradation increased to about 60% by Fenton reaction 
(Ginos et al., 2006).  
A landfill leachate was able to be discharged after being treated through a coagulation -
ozonation process. Coagulation permitted to achieve COD removals up to 72%, and ozonation as 
post-treatment attained a COD of 150 mgO 2.L-1 leading to a global COD reduction of 85% of COD 
(Ntampou et al., 2006) .

  I. INTRODUCTION   
 
42 II.5 Biological Treatment  
Biological treatment is the most frequent, economically and ecologi cally attractive technique 
for wastewater management compared with chemical and physical remediation (Tabrizi and 
Mehrvar, 2004). With appropriate analysis and environmental control, most of the wastewaters can 
be treated biologically. Consequently, it is essential to comprehend the characteristics of each 
biological process to guarantee that the suitable environment is produced and controlled effectively.  
Generally by means of activated sludge in adequate conditions (Droste, 1990), has 
conclusive advantag es for the oxidation of organic pollutants. However, many compounds cannot be 
successfully eliminated by biological oxidation because of their inherent high toxicity. The need to 
pH adjustment to an adequate value and comply with the nutrients and oxygen i n sufficient quantities 
for the transforming microorganisms are standard requirements for the viability of the process that 
depends fundamentally on the health and activity of those microorganisms . 
II.5.1  Fundamentals  
The principal goals of the biological treatm ent of wastewater are coagulation of colloidal 
organic matter, removal of carbonaceous BOD and elimination of the non -settled colloidal solids in 
order to stabilize organic matter. Besides all of that, for an industrial wastewater, the main objective 
is to eliminate and decrease the concentration of organic and inorganic compounds such as nitrogen 
and phosphorous (Metcalf and Eddy, 1991).  
The process consists in a group of microbial cells that use energy and carbon for cells growth 
and preservation, by mean s of biochemical reactions. There are two kinds of processes in the 
biological treatment, aerobic and anaerobic. The former is done in the presence of oxygen while the 
anaerobic is executed in the oxygen absence (Metcalf and Eddy, 1991). Microorganisms can  be 
classified as aerobic, anaerobic or facultative depending on their oxygen requirements. The 
facultative are those capable to operate in either presence or absence of molecular oxygen. Biological 
processes can be also classified according to the microor ganisms location, if they are fixed on solid 
supports or kept in suspension in the aqueous medium (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004). In both cases, 
in order to make the treatment more complete, it is normally necessary to guarantee the removal of 
the microbial c ells from the wastewater after the treatment.  
The biotreatment units are constituted by a large heterogeneity of organized complexes of 
biological populations. The most important microorganisms implicated are bacteriabut other 
metabolic activities are impo rtant in bioremediation. Those microorganisms are used to convert the II. STATE OF ART  
43 colloidal and dissolved organic matter into less complex compounds, gases and into cell tissue. Since 
cell tissue has specific gravity a little higher than water, the resultant cells can  be eas ily removed by 
gravity settling  (Carucci et al., 1995) . 
The necessities of treatment and the environmental conditions influence the microorganisms 
selection and the biological process operation. Consequently, it is essential to control some 
paramete rs, as for instance, the hydraulic regime and mixing. These permit to determine the substrate 
accessibility to microorganisms and the oxygen and inorganic nutrients availability, as well as vital 
elements for cells synthesis such as nitrogen and phosphorou s and trace elements such as potassium, 
calcium and magnesium. Otherwise, the cellular growth can slow down. These elements need to be 
present at a specified ratio to allow an appropriate growth. Many industrial effluents are nutrient 
deficient; therefore,  principally nitrogen and/or phosphorous must be added (Carucci et al., 1995). 
The ratios at which nutrients should be supplied are expressed in COD: N: P ratios and various 
optimal ratios are reported in literature as 100:10:1 (Metcalf and Eddy, 1991).  
The design of the processes is based on an assessment of microbial growth and substrate 
conversion kinetics. This mostly involves the use of Monod -type equations together with cell yield 
and decay expressions which are then combined with the hydraulic proper ties of the reactor to yield 
efficiency expressions.  
This work is based on an aerobic treatment since it is easier to carry out, more rapid and leads 
to an effective process for the biodegradation of the majority of pollutants . 
II.5.2  Aerobic Treatment  
Aerobic effluent treatments are essentially based on the bacteria capacity of assimilating 
biodegradable organic matter present in a wastewater. Normally, this is the chosen method for 
biological treatment of a polluted wastewater with many organic compounds aerobic ally oxidable. 
This process aims the decomposition of organic matter yielding carbon and water as final 
mineralization products, mainly by action of heterotrophic bacteria’s (with consequent energy 
production through fermentation or organic matter oxidatio n). 
 Biodegradation of organic matter under aerobic conditions involves the oxidation of organic 
compounds to carbon dioxide, water, nitrate, phosphate and sulphate. The process of decomposition 
during biological treatment can be determined by these change s in the effluent.  
The biochemical reactions involved in the microbial metabolism in the aerobic degradation 
can be described by the following simplified biochemical reactions (Equations II.31 to II.33), where Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
44 CHON represents the organic matter and new cel ls are represented by C 8H15O4N (Metcalf and Eddy, 
1991) :

 The above described biochemical reactions involve the degradation of the substrate and 
energy supply for the synthesis of new cells and other biochemical processes that provide the material 
necessary for cell growth. In the absence of external food sources the organisms will use previously 
stored endogenous food supplies for their respiration which can lead to the previous  products referred 
in Equation II.33, but also to some organic substances (Eckenfelder, 2000).  
 In addition to the carbon, autotrophic bacteria are able to metabolize some inorganic 
compounds in the aqueous medium such as nitrogen based compounds. In waste water, nitrogen is 
present in the form of organic nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen, essential nutrients in the biological 
treatment systems. The oxidation of nitrogen compounds takes place in two stages. In the first stage, 
in the presence of oxygen, living o rganisms will convert organic nitrogen to ammonia nitrogen and 
in the second stage ammonia is converted to nitrite and nitrate nitrogen. Nitrification is accomplished 
by the presence of nitrifying autotrophic bacteria, the nitrosomonas that can catalyse th e oxidation 
of ammonia to nitrite using molecular oxygen, while further oxidize nitrite to nitrate using oxygen 
derived from the water molecule. They use carbon dioxide as their source of carbon while the 
oxidation of ammonia gives them the required energy  (Eckenfelder, 2000). This will lead to the 
generation of cell material as previously described in Equations II.32 and II.33   (Equations II.34 and 
II.35):    
2 𝑁𝐻4++ 3 𝑂2 𝑁𝑖𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑠→         2 𝑁𝑂2−+ 4 𝐻++ 2 𝐻2𝑂+𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦    (II.34 ) 
 2 𝑁𝑂2−+  𝑂2 𝑁𝑖𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑟→          2 𝑁𝑂3−+ 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦       (II.35 ) II. STATE OF ART  
45  At proper environment and operation conditions, the carbonace ous organic matter 
degradation and the nitrification process can simultaneous occur. However, nitrification is the 
limiting step in the biological treatment because the growth rates of nitrifying bacteria are slower 
than the heterotrophic ones.  
 Apart from  nutrient requirements, other factors can affect the efficiency of biological 
treatment, as is the case of environmental conditions and nature of organics. The information of 
toxicity and non -biodegradable compounds from wastewater is essential because the se constituents 
cannot be assimilated by the biomass cells. Physical characteristics such as pH and temperature of 
aqueous medium must be between 6 -8 and 25 -33ºC, respectively, because these ranges favor 
metabolic reactions to occur faster and permit maxim um growth rates (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004).  
 As mentioned before, in this type of process, organic matter is removed from the medium by 
biological metabolism, oxygen is consumed by the organisms, new cells are being created and an 
excess of sludge is pro duced. This associated sludge production is the main disadvantage, since a 
posterior management is required prior to its disposal. The principal objective of sludge treatment is 
to stabilize, to reduce odors and some of the water, to decompose some of the organic matter and 
eliminate disease causing organisms. Normally, a typical sludge treatment is constituted by the 
following steps: thickening, dewatering and stabilization process followed by a main treatment 
(Aloui et al., 2009). The sludge volume is red uced by thickening and dewatering processes. 
Subsequently, is stabilized by oxidation with chlorine, thermal treatment or anaerobic digestion. To 
conclude, the solid residues are normally incinerated, destined to land applications or deposited at a 
landfil l.    
II.5.3  Basic Types of Aerobic Biological Systems for Wastewaters 
Treatment  
An elementar classification of biological systems can be done in view of the aggregation 
state of biomass. Therefore, there are essentially two types of biological wastewater treatme nt 
processes, thesuspended growth and immobilized growth biological system.   
Suspended growth biological systems depend on mixing to keep microorganisms in 
suspension, and guarantee that they are in continuous contact which most substrate as possible.  In  
the immobilized growth systems, microorganisms are linked to a solid medium and the effluent 
passes through the medium as a film.    
The immobilized growth configurations are advantageous compared to the suspend growth 
systems when the wastewater has high  concentrations of pollutants, because this type of 
configuration permits a higher cellular density. Beyond this, it has been demonstrated that this system Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
46 is more tolerable to shock loadings and produces less biological sludge. However, it is very difficu lt 
to do the quantification of biomass (Eckenfelder, 2000).  
Therefore, since the concentration and the quantity of treated effluents to be used in this 
future work are not expected to be too high, suspended growth system will be used to assess 
biodegradati on.  
Suspended growth systems maintain the biomass in suspension in the wastewater during the 
treatment time. The biomass grows as suspended flocs of microorganisms. Normally, some type of 
mixing is employed to guarantee a constant contact with the substra te. Once biodegradation is over, 
biomass flocks are removed for clarification.  
The common types of suspended growth configurations principally consist on batch or 
continuous flow reactors. Aerobic active sludge process operating in continuous flow mode inc ludes 
a biological reactor coupled to a solids capture device, such as a clarifier or a solid separator. There 
is the introduction of wastewater in an aerated and mixed tank containing the suspended 
microorganisms. Once the biological degradation is carrie d out, biomass is settled out in a separated 
clarifier tank. At the end, a part of the biomass is recycled back to the process and the rest is 
periodically wasted (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004).  
The batch operation is the oldest type and the most commonly us ed version is called 
Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR). Contrary to continuous flow mode, the SBR holds the complete 
biological treatment in a single tank, following a timed controlled sequence composed in five stages: 
filling, reaction, settling, draw and id le. The raw wastewater is added to the reactor and mixed with 
the biomass held in the tank. The metabolic biological reactions, involving the consumption of 
organic matter in presence of oxygen initiated during filling, are completed in the reaction phase by 
starting the proper mixing and/or aeration. Aeration and mixing are then stopped promoting the 
settling stage where the sludge is separated from the supernatant formed during the sedimentation. 
The reactor then is emptied and prepared for a new cycle of  treatment (idle). During the idle, the 
sludge in excess is wasted (Eckenfelder, 2000).  
The most remarkable advantage of the SBR technology is the simplicity, the suitability for 
simple automatization, the easy managing of unexpected effects, flexibility o f operation, and the 
lower economic costs. However, major drawbacks are the requirement of a fairly large bioreactor 
with a long treatment time and the great quantity of excess sludge production .

47 II.6 Combination of AOPs with Chemical and Biological 
Treatm ents  
For the treatment of wastewaters that are non -toxic in general, the biological process is the 
most appropriate from an economical point of view (Alvares et al., 2001). However, when the 
effluent is characterized by bio -toxic or recalcitrant organics, biological processes alone are not 
always capable to make an effluent suitable for discharge into hydrological resources. Thus, the 
combination between chemical andbiological treatments arise as appropriate solutions (Mantzavinos 
and Psillakis, 2004; Gogat e and Pandit, 200 4b). 
II.6.1  Fundamentals  
In general, chemical processes using oxidizing agents, such as ozone and hydrogen peroxide, 
are relatively expensive due to the associated elevated investment and operational costs with high 
energy and chemicals demand. T hus they can often be prohibitive for wastewater treatment (Gogate 
and Pandit, 200 4a; Sangave et al., 2007; Primo et al., 2008).  
Thus, process optimization and, when possible, process integration with less expensive 
technologies need to be considered (Bau tista et al., 2008; Primo et al., 2008; Mandal et al., 2010b). 
In this process plan, AOPs can be envisaged as pretreatments to enhance biodegradability and 
diminish toxicity (Parra et al., 2000; Sarria et al., 2001  and 2002) since such chemical oxidation 
systems generally produce oxygenated organic by -products and low molecular weight acids that are 
more biodegradable (Mantzavinos and Psillakis, 2004; Sangave et al., 2007). With the AOPs, toxic 
compounds would be removed until no inhibition due to its toxic ity is present and/or non -
biodegradable compounds turned into more biodegradable (Cañizares et al., 2000; Klavarioti et al. , 
2009; Alvares et al., 2001; Sangave et al., 2007).  After that, pre -treated effluents can be safely sent 
to the biological treatmen t that will reduce contamination levels down to the legislation limits 
(Comninellis et al., 2008; Primo et al., 2008).   
In particular, the oxidant agent should be used mainly towards recalcitrant compounds 
oxidation hence avoiding removing biodegradable p ollutants that can be biologically degraded, with 
the aim of transforming refractory compounds into more biodegradable ones, avoiding their 
mineralization (Di Iaconi, 2012). This aspect is economically attractive, as investment and the 
operating costs are much lower for a biological process than for an AOP. In fact, the investment costs 
for biological processes are from 5 to 20 times lower than for chemical systems, while treatment 
costs are lower within a range from 3 to 10 times (Scott and Ollis, 1996; Ca ñizares et al.,  2000). 
Thus, the synergistic effect of coupling chemical -biological oxidation, could increase COD removal, Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
48 and simultaneously reduce the chemicals requirements, achieving an interesting economic advantage 
(Mandal et al., 2010a).  
Focusing o n this strategy, a scheme used to plan a combined chemical oxidation process with 
a biological treatment is presented in Figure  II.6.1. The wastewater can be classified as biodegradable 
or non -biodegradable. Biodegradable wastewaters can be directly bio tr eated (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 
2004). When the wastewater contains small concentrations of recalcitrant pollutants, partly 
biodegradable, there are two possible alternatives. An adaption of the activated sludge to remove the 
small biodegradable fraction of wa stewater and then carry out an AOP stage to abate the remaining 
refractory COD can be chosen. On the other hand, for non -biodegradable wastewaters chemical 
oxidation is the first stage avoiding complete mineralization and aiming to enhance biodegradability  
in order to produce an effluent able to be submitted to a posterior biotreatment (Mantzavinos and 
Psillakis, 2004). Thereby, a wastewater highly or completely resistant to conventional biological 
oxidation can be totally mineralized using a combined chemi cal-biological system (Aparício et al., 
2007).  
In a combined biological -chemical -biological treatment, the first biological step has the 
function of removing biodegradable organic compounds. The chemical process allows reducing 
pollutants concentration and  yield more oxidized compounds, which are in most cases more easily 
biodegradable and the second biological step concludes the oxidation treatment (Bertanza et al.,   
2001).  
When working with integrated biological and chemical processes, a few aspects mus t be 
avoided. The chemical oxidants cannot be mixed with the bio culture, because they could damage 
the microorganisms. When a biological process is receiving the oxidized effluent, excessive chemical 
oxidation may result in highly oxidized products with l ittle metabolic value for the microorganisms 
(Aparicio et al., 2007). Large doses of oxidant or contact times could be wasted on easily 
biodegradable intermediates resulting in decreased efficiency. pH also can have a harmful effect, 
normally for acidic va lues. Chemical wastewaters treatment could require acid pH conditions, and, 
generally, this type of systems produce acid species in the oxidation process (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 
2004). For that reason, pH readjustment to a value near to 7 is necessary before  feeding the biological 
reactor .

 Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
50 As observed from Figure  II.6.1, a fundamental aspect is the assessment of the 
biodegradability and toxicity along the chemical proc ess. This is to determine an optimal 
pretreatment time that is able to guarantee the application of the coupled system (Andreozzi et al.,   
1999). There are various tests used to provide the biodegradability and toxicity of the generated by 
products, eithe r by ecotoxicological analyses or by chemical characterization (Schrank et al., 2005). 
The biodegradation tests such as BOD 5 are usually used to predict the biodegradation behavior of a 
material in the medium through standardized methods leading to the BOD 5/COD ratio (Mantzavinos 
and Psillakis, 2004; Gotvajn et al., 2009) that constitutes an index of screening aerobic 
biodegradability. It is recognized that an effluent presenting a ratio BOD 5/COD > 0.4 may be 
considered biodegradable (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2 004; Esplugas et al., 2004). On the other hand, 
ready biodegradability assessment by means of respirometric techniques is well considered because 
it measures the instantaneous response of a microorganisms community when in contact with a 
pollutant. Besides , it permits to establish the toxic character of the sample (Gutiérrez et al., 2002; 
Mantzavinos and Psillakis, 2004; Gotvajn et al., 2009b).  
Regarding the toxicity, besides the respirometric method, the measurement of the activity 
inhibition of different  microorganisms such as luminescent bacteria ( Vibrio fischeri ) is generally 
employed (Gutiérrez et al., 2002; Gotvajn et al. , 2009 a; Perdigón -Melón et al. , 2010 ). Acute 
bioassays are considered of simple execution and manipulation, as well as low cost and reliability 
and repeatability characteristics. In our research group all these methodologies have been used in our 
latest research in this field. In this ambit, respirometry, BOD 5, BOD 5/COD ratio and Vibrio fischeri  
light inhibition were used to assess the  biodegradability and toxicity of the treated wastewaters 
(Martins et al., 2010a  and 2010b) .  
II.6.2  Applications to Wastewater Treatment  
In line with what was previously described, the coagulation appears as one of the easiest 
techniques to implement, with resu lts in several studies.  Table II.6.1 depicts the treatment methods 
associated with integrated processes in which Advanced Oxidation Processes are applied, presenting 
also the main conclusions.    
A wide range of studies has already stated the potential of t hese coupled systems to treat 
different model compounds and real wastewaters from various origins. Examples are olive mill 
wastewaters, paper pulp bleaching effluents, textile waters, wastewaters containing pesticides, wine -
distillery effluents and landfil l leachates, among others.  II. STATE OF ART  
51 The choice of the appropriate chemical and biological units depends on the characteristics of 
the wastewater and the treatment purpos. The biological process may involve isolated or mixed 
organisms cultures acting under different  oxygen environments and located on fixed solids supports 
or suspended in the media. Among the proposed coupled technologies, special attention has been 
given to combining AOPs and aerobic biological processes.  
Typical sequences are composed by ozonation (O3) - aerobic treatment (Chaturaprek et al.,   
2005; Wang et al., 2008; Lafi et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010; Sangave et al., 2007; Aparicio et al., 2007; 
Moraes et al., 2006, Di Iaconi, 2012), and Fenton type reactions - aerobic treatment (Bressan et al.,   
2004; Chen et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009; Lodha and Chaudhari, 2007; Tünay 
et al., 2008; You et al., 2011, Mandal et al., 2010a).  Also dealing with aerobic biological treatments, 
the inverse strategies such the aerobic process follo wed by ozonation (Lafi et al.,  2009) or by Fenton 
(Blanco et al. , 2011 ) have been reported.  
Finally, more complex chemical -biological processes have also been proposed. As the 
example of the treatment cycle that implies a two stage aerobic - O3 sequence (S angave et al.,  2007; 
García -Montaño et al., 2008; Hagman et al., 2008), ozonation and Fenton in the same process (Goi 
et al., 2009, Martins et al., 2013) or the applications of two or more treatment stages, as the case of 
flocculation -Fenton -ozonation to a ttain a biological oxidizable wastewater. Usually, this kind of 
integrated processes have a previous coagulation/flocculation stage for solids elimination and attempt 
of some COD removal (Chen et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009), having the  effect 
of equalizing the effluent to the variation in solids content.  
The use of a physical/chemical treatment before an oxidation stage is commonly employed 
to treat landfill leachates (Bila, 2005; de Velasquez and Monje -Ramirez, 2006; Ntampou  et al.,  2006; 
Deng, 2007), cosmetics and chemicals wastewater (Perdigón -Melón et al.,  2008, Xing and Sun, 
2009), wash jeans wastewater (Wang et al., 2008) and herbicide and pesticide production 
wastewaters (Martins  et al.,  2005 and Chen et al., 2007, respectively).  Coagulation followed by 
ozonation has been a process widely used for an initial removal of the suspensions and some solids 
as reported in the treatment of landfill leachate (Velasquez, and Monje -Ramirez, 2006; Ntampou et 
al., 2006; Poznyak et al., 2008).   The reverse, ozonation followed by coagulation / flocculation was 
the subject of study of Ntampou et al., (2006) with better removal of chemical oxygen demand than 
the reaction system described above.  The coagulation process coupled with the Fenton proces s was 
studied in the treatment of an effluent from the cosmetics industry (Perdigon -Melon et al.,  2008) and 
for combined industrial and domestic wastewater, achieving 90% and 100% of COD and color 
removal, respectivley (Badawy and Ali, 2006).  Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
52 The combinat ion of Fenton process followed by ozonation and the reverse scheme was 
analyzed for landfill leachate  (Goi et al., 2009) and distillery effluent (Martins et al., 2013) with the 
first option showing better results, increasing the BOD 5/COD to 0.98 on the las t one. 
Regarding  ozonation followed by biological systems, proposals were made for the treatment of 
domestic sewage by biofiltration (Wang et al., 2008), effluent of landfill leachate (Chaturaprek et 
al.,2005, Di Iaconi et al., 2012), production of oil (La fi et al., 2009) tannery  and textile factory 
wastewater (Di Iaconi et al., 2012).  Similar to the latter, the scheme biological + ozonation + 
biological was referred by Sangave and collaborators (2008) for the purification of distilleries 
effluents and for  the treatment of oil mill effluents (Lafi et al.,  2009).   Ramos (2009) proposed the 
system of chemical precipitation followed by ozonation for purifying cleansing effluents from paper 
industry.  The Fenton process followed by an aerobic biological process was proposed for the 
depuration of detergents wastewaters (Wang et al., 2008), while Chen and assistants (2007) used a 
clotting pre stage for the purification of pesticides residual waters and  for olive oil mill effluents 
treatment with a remarkable 90% o f COD depletion (Bressan et al., 2004).  Primo et al.  (2008) 
suggested the Fenton process with subsequent neutralization and ultrafiltration as a feasible treatment 
for landfill leachate, reaching 80% removal of COD and total depletion of color, solids and iron. 
Processes with 4 steps, coagulation, hydrolysis, Fenton and filtration, were applied to effluent from 
jeans washing with removals above 90% for COD, color and suspended solids (Wang et al., 2008).   
The major highlight of the presented works is undoub tedly the increase of the ratio 
BOD 5/COD by the action of chemical oxidative treatments before the biological processes, and the 
polishing effects of AOPs by oxidizing the remaining organic matter refractory to biological 
treatment .

69 III. ANALYTICAL METHODS AND EXPERIMENTAL 
PROCEDURE  
This chapter describes the materials and experimental methods used in the bench and  full 
scale studies including descript ions of the analytical methods.  
III.1   Chemical Assays  
III.1.1  pH  
The pH measurements were carried out with a Crison micropH 2000,  and a HANNA HI 4522  
pH-meter  calibrated with two buffer solutions of pH 4 and 7. The analyses were n ot performed on 
line, but after each sample withdrawal . 
III.1.2   Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC)   
DOC  is the amount of carbon in the form of CO 2 produced when a dissolved organic 
substance is completely oxidized. It corresponds to the fraction of Total Organic Carb on (TOC) that 
passes through a 0.45 µm pore filter.  
The TOC measurement is mainly required in order to evaluate the degree of mineralization 
of the pollutants during the oxidation process.  TOC determination is based on the total oxidation of 
all carbon p resent in solution to CO 2 to measure the Total Carbon (TC) and the Inorganic Carbon 
(IC). Subsequently, TOC (mg L-1) is calculated by subtracting IC from TC. The TOC -analyzer model 
that was used was a Shimadzu 5000 TOC Analyser  with an auto-sampler Shimadz u ASI -5000A .   
TC measurement is based on the combustion of the aqueous sample over a palladium -platin 
catalyst at 680°C. Thus, all carbon is converted into carbon dioxide and transported by a carrier gas 
to a Non Dispersive Infrared Detector (NDIR) which will determine the amount of carbon dioxide 
produced. For IC measurement, the sample is acidified with a 25% (w/v) phosphoric acid. At those 
conditions, inorganic sources of carbon such as carbonate and hydrogen carbonate are liberated as 
CO 2 and stripped from solution by the carrier gas to the NDIR.  
Finally TOC is calculated as the difference between TC and IC. To determine the amount of 
TC, IC and TOC present in solution, standard solutions are required. A linear relationship between Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
70 the detector signal a nd the carbon concentration leads to calibration curves allowing TC and IC 
quantification. Potassium phthalate is used to calibrate TOC whereas sodium carbonate and 
hydrogencarbonate standards are applied for IC calibration curves (Silva, 2004). All the st andard 
solutions are prepared with water purified in a Millipore -Q system . 
III.1.3  Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)  
Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) measures the amount of oxygen needed to totally oxidize 
the organic matter contained in solution. COD estimates, thus, the amount of organic compounds 
present in an aqueous solution. It should be had into account the possible interferences of inorganic 
species (Fe2+ and Fe3+, Cl-, NO 2-, H 2O2, etc).  
The Chemical Oxygen Demand is determined by the method stipulated in Standard M ethods 
5220 D: closed reflux , colorimetric method (Greenberg et al., 1985). The test procedure involves the 
heating to an elevated temperature (150°C) of a known sample volume with excess of potassium 
dichromate, in presence of acid (H 2SO 4) and Silver sulp hate, as catalyst for the oxidation of organic 
matter, during a period of two hours in a sealed glass tube. Mercury shulphate is also included to 
avoid the interference of oxidized chloride.   
During the oxidation time it can be noticed the change in color  due to the transformation 
dichromate (yellow) to chromic ion (green). After this process, the vials are cooled down to room 
temperature. Equation III.1 shows the reduction of dichromate ion to oxidize organic matter . 
𝐶𝑟2𝑂72− +14 𝐻+ +6 𝑒−→2 𝐶𝑟3+ +7 𝐻2𝑂      (III.1)  
WTW CR3000 and HANNA HI 839800 thermoreactors were used for the digestion while 
two spectrophotometers were used, WTM MPM3000 and HANNA HI 83224, to detect colour changes 
directly providing COD data in terms of mg O 2 L-1. Analyses were done at least in duplicate to check 
the repeatability and a potassium hydrogenophthalate solution with known concentration is used as 
control sample . 
III.1.4  Average Oxidation State ( AOS)  
The Average Oxidation State (AOS ) gives  the information  about the carbon oxidation state 
in the effluent: superior COD/TOC ratios imply a higher degree of mineralization (+4) while smaller 
ratios means partial oxidation ( -4) (Al Momani et al., 2004).  
These values were estimated according to the following Equat ion III.2 : III. ANA LYTICAL METHODS AND EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE  
71 𝐴𝑂𝑆=4.(𝑇𝑂𝐶−𝐶𝑂𝐷)
𝑇𝑂𝐶         (III.2)  
where TOC and COD are respectively expressed in moles of C.L-1 and moles of O 2.L-1. 
Average oxidation state takes values between +4 for CO 2, the most oxidised state of C and -4 for 
CH 4, the most reduced state of C.   
III.1.5  Color and Aromatic Content Analysis by Uv/Vis 
SpectropHotometry  
The UV/Vis -absorption spectra of pollutant solutions were recorded in the 200 -900 nm range 
by using a T60 PG Instruments spectrophotometer  and 10 mm light path quartz cell s. 
Color data are reported as the absorbance at the maximum absorption in the visible region 
which is considered as a quantitative estimation of the color of the solution. On the other hand, the 
absorbance at 254.0 nm wavelength (UV 254) is taken as the ref erence parameter to monitor the

III.1.6   Total and Volatile Suspended Solids (TSS, VSS)  
Suspended solids or non -filterable solids refer to matter suspended in water and wastewater. 
Solids analyses are important in the contr ol of biological and physical wastewater treatment 
processes and for assessing compliance with regulatory thresholds.  
A well -mixed sample is filtered through a weighed standard glass fiber filter with a porosity 
of 45 μm. The residue retained on the filter is dried until constant weight at 103 to 105 °C. The 
increase in weight of the filter represents the total suspended solids, TSS, which include all particles 
suspended in water that did not pass through the filter (Equation  III.3) : 
𝑇𝑆𝑆=(𝐴−𝐵)×1000
𝑉𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒         (III.3)  
Where A is the weight of the filter plus dried residue and B is the weight of the fil ter, both 
in g units. The sample volume is given in ml and TSS is thus calculated in g.l-1. 
The filter and dried solids attained in the previous point are ignited at 550°C to constant 
weight for 1 hour in a furnace. The weight lost on combustion is represe ntative of the volatile 
suspended solids, VSS (Equation  III.4), and included the non -dissolved organic content of the 
sample:  Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:

𝑉𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒         (III.4)  
Where C is the weight of the residue plus the filter after ignition, both in g units and the 
sample volume is given in ml, leading to VSS in g.l-1. The remaining solid ash, of inorganic nature, 
corres ponds to the Fixed Total Solids (FTS g.l-1). 
III.1.7  Total Phenol Content (TPh)  
Total phenol content was determined by using the Folin -Ciocalteau method (Folin e 
Ciocalteau, 1927).  
According to the methodology, 20 µL of sample are introduced in a cuvette, posteri ty diluted 
with 1.58 mL of distillated water. Then 100 µL of Foulin Ciocalteau reagent are added and after 3 to 
6 minutes, 300 µL of a saturated solution of sodium carbonate (Na 2CO 3) is introduced to alkalinize 
the solution.  After reacting during 2 h at r oom temperature in a dark place the absorbance is 
measured at 765 nm by a T60 PG Instruments spectrophotometer  against a blank sample containing 
distilled water instead of sample. Results are expressed as milligrams of gallic acid equivalents 
(GAE) since t he calibration curve was previously performed with different concentrations of this 
compound (Martins and Quinta -Ferreira, 2009) . 
III.1.8  Total Nitrogen  
Total content content was determined using  Chromotropic Method in accordance with the 
protocol given by HANNA INSTRUMENTS.  
This method allows quantifying all forms of nitrogen and nitrates through a persulfate 
digestion. It should be taken into account possible interferences with residual chlorine and oxidants.  
Two moles of nitrate / nitrogen react with one mole of chromotropic acid to form a yellow 
reaction product presenting a maximum absorbance at 410 nm.  
The method involves the heating to 105°C of a known sample volume with excess of 
potassium persulfate in presence of acid, during a period of 30 minutes in a sealed glass tube.  After 
this time and when the tubes are at room temperature Sodium Metabissulfite was added. After 3 
minutes, the reactant 93767 -0 was introduced.  After 2 minutes, 2 mL of this digested sample was 
added to one Reagent Vial, and after 5 minutes the test was performed. During the oxidation process 
time, it could be noticed the change in the color of the chromotropic acid from translucent to yellow. 
After this process, the vials were cooled to room temperature  III. ANA LYTICAL METHODS AND EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE  
73 Through the spectrophotometer HANNA HI 83224, the color changes were measured 
directly providing TN data in terms of mg L-1. 
III.1.9  Total Phosphorous  
Total Phosphorous Phosphorous content was determined in accordance with the protocol 
given by HANNA INSTRUMENTS.  
This method is referred as an  adaptation of the EPA method 365.2 and Standard Methods for 
the Examination of Water and Wastewater, 4500 -EP, ascorbic acid method. It permits to quantify all 
forms of phosphates through a persulfate digestion that converts organic and condensed inorganic  
phosphates into orthophosphates that react with the existent reactants changing the color to blue.  The 
change is measured with a HANNA HI 83224 spectrophotometer given the concentration of TP in 
terms of mg.L-1. 
The test procedure involves the heating to  an elevated temperature (150 °C) of a known 
sample volume and the content of a packet of potassium persulfate is added. After 30 minutes of 
digestion, the vial is cooled at room temperature. Sodium Hydroxide is added, and the zero is 
measured. After adding  a packet of HI 93758 -0 Phosphorous reactant, it is stirred to dissolve well 
and past 3 minutes one proceeds to its measurement trought spectrophotometetryc mesurement.  
It should be taken into account possible interferences with arsenate, residual sulfide  and 
turbidity . 
III.1.10  Iron and Chlorid ion  
Iron ions were assed in the liquid phase by atomic absorption (Perkin -Elmer 3300, Waltham, 
MA).  
The Chloride ions concentration was determined by ionic chromatography Water Action 
Analyser equipped with a conductivity d etector Waters 431 .

74 III.2  Biological Assays  
III.2.1  Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD 5) 
The Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) estimates the amount of biologically degradable 
organic matter present in a volume of aqueous medium at a defined temperature over a specified time  
period and expressed in mg O 2.L-1. This parameter normally reflects the amount of oxygen consumed 
by aerobic bacteria in five days (BOD 5) at 20°C.  
The procedure to obtain BOD 5 was as follows. Initially, a buffered solution containing 
essential nutrients w as prepared. The buffered solution consists on MgSO 4.7H 2O; FeCl 3.6H 2O; CaCl 2 
prepared previously. This water sample was aerated in a period of 24 hours to ensure oxygen 
saturation.  
The used microorganisms came from an activated sludge bio -reactor. The prep aration of 
these consisted on taking a certain volume of activated sludge bacteria solution, decant it, remove 
the supernatant, and take the bottom layer, which contain the bacteria.   
The volume of sample to be tested had to be carefully selected since ve ry high pollutant 
concentration can lead to a final oxygen concentration below 2 mgO 2.L-1, meaning that, after a certain 
point, bacteria could have been degrading the organic compounds anaerobically. In other hand, very 
low loads can promote negligible oxy gen consumption which increases the experimental error when 
measuring dissolved oxygen. In this context, as a guideline, one can assume BOD 5 equal to COD to 
select the sample volume to use (Vs).  
For each BOD test, a “blank bottle” (B) had to be arranged, containing the bacteria, buffer 
and nutrient solutions and distillate water. This blank had into account that bacteria still consume 
oxygen even in the absence of substrate (endogeneous respiration). Moreover, a standard 
glucose/glutamic acid solution with  a known BOD 5 range was also prepared to verify if the procedure 
was well applied.  
The biological test consisted of filling an airtight 300 mL (V) BOD bottle with sample, 
removing the headspace. The bottle sample was incubating for 5 days at 20 °C in the d ark. Dissolved 
oxygen is measured initially (DO i) and following incubation (DO f) using an automatic dissolved 
oxygen measurement apparatus (WTW INOLab 740 and a HANNA HI 4421). BOD 5 was estimated 
from the difference between initial and final dissolved oxyg en (DO) (Equation III.5). All the tests 
were done in triplicate to minimize the experimental error . III. ANA LYTICAL METHODS AND EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

III.2.2  Effluent Biodegradability  
In order to define, measure or control the effluent treatment processes it is important to 
evaluate biodegradability. Generally, it is well acce pted that the relation between BOD 5 and COD, 
is a good reference of the effluents biodegradability (Equation III.6):  
Biodegradability =BOD5
COD        (III.6)  
If the biodegradability tends to 0, the wastewater biological treatment would be 
difficult.  Instead, if the value tends to 1 the effluent has availability for biological depuration. Usually 
a biodegradability higher than 0.4, is used as the limit from which effluent is considered to be 
biodegradable (Esplugas et al., 2004).  
III.2.3  Acute Toxicity Lumistox  Bioassay  
The commercial Lumistox test is one of the commonly used assays as a bioluminescence -
measuring test. It is based on the change of light emission by Vibrio fischeri  (Photobacterium 
phosphoreum) when exposed to toxic chemicals. The bioluminescence is directly linked to the 
vitality and metabolic state of the cells, therefore a toxic substance causing changes in the cellular 
state can lead to a rapid reduction of bioluminescence.  
In concrete, this method measures the concentration that causes the in hibition of 20 and 50% 
of the bacteria population after a specific time of bacteria -toxic substance contact. These values 
correspond to the effective concentrations giving 20 and 50% inhibition of light output (EC 20 and 
EC 50, expressed in mg.L-1). The toxi city evaluation followed the ISO DIS 11348. The test is carried 
out in a luminometer ( Lumistox Dr. Lange GmbH , Berlin, Germany ).  
The test kits acquired from Dr. Bruno Lange GmbH, Berlin, Germany, were used without 
modification, and distillated water is ap plied. The pH of the samples is adjusted to 7.0±0.2. During 
pH adjustment, the volume of sample should not increase more than 5%. After that, the salinity of 
the sample was adjusted with NaCl to 2% (w/v). Samples should be kept at 15°C until the beginning 
of the experiment into the Lumistherm Dr. Lange.  
The EC values were determined by combining different dilutions of the potential toxic 
sample, according with ISO DIS 11348. First, the luminescense intensity was measured and Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
76 immediately 0.5 mL of diluted sa mple was added to the bacteria solution. After the selected contact 
time, generally 15 minutes, the light intensity was measured again. The inhibitory effect of dilution 
was compared to a control free of toxic sample, and the EC 20 and EC 50 values were dire ctly provided 
by the Lumistox software . 
III.2.4  Respirometry Test  
Respirometry is the measurement and understanding of the biological oxygen consumption 
rate under well -defined experimental conditions. Oxygen consumption is directly related with both 
biomass grow th and substrate removal, and it is a useful technique for modeling and operating the 
activated sludge process. Respirometric methodology was chosen over other conventional techniques 
because it allows determining biodegradability, toxicity and inhibitory effects over a real sample of 
microorganisms, thus being a more realistic analysis than those using a specific strain of bacteria, 
because there is a heterogeneity of bacteriological communities, which suits the real application 
conditions of biological tr eatment.  
The respirometric assay was used to determine the Oxygen Uptake Rate (OUR). The OUR 
determination involves an estimation of the biomass oxygen consumption rate when assimilating 
organic matter giving the amount of oxygen consumed per time unit.  
The measurements were carried out by controlling the oxygen input and output in a liquid -
static -static (LSS) respirometer at 25±0.2°C (Greenberg et al., 1985). In this type of reactor, the 
oxygen measure is performed in the liquid phase by keeping under stat ic conditions the liquid and 
gas phase. The variation of dissolved oxygen (DO) is plotted versus time and the OUR is then 
calculated (Equation III.7):  
𝑑(𝑉𝑙×𝐷𝑂)
𝑑𝑡=−𝑂𝑈𝑅×𝑉𝑙         (III.7)  
Where V l, is the volume of the liquid phase expr essed in dm3, and DO  is the concentration 
of dissolved oxygen expressed in mg DO.dm-3, with OUR expressed in mg DO dm-3s-1. 
The activated sludge used as inoculums of the respirometer was directly obtained from an 
aerobic stage from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). 250 mL of the active sludge suspension 
were placed in the reactor and air flowed until dissolved oxygen reaches 7 mg L-1. After this, the air 
diffuser was removed and  the reactor is sealed. The OUR of the microorganisms in absence of any 
nutrient gives the OUR endogenous  measured by plotting the DO vs time. This measurement was required 
prior to any other because it permits obtaining the exogenous consumption of the organic matter of 
the sample (Equation III.8) : III. ANA LYTICAL METHODS AND EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE  
77 𝑂𝑈𝑅𝑒𝑥𝑜𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑠 =𝑂𝑈𝑅𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒−𝑂𝑈𝑅𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑠         (III.8)  
From this point on, the OUR of a sample is referred to its OUR exogenous . 
Thus, for biodegradability assessment it was done a quantification of OUR corresponding to 
a completely biodegradable st andard (acetic acid) which was used as a reference (OUR acid I) to 
compare with the OUR of the potentially toxic sample with the same COD content. A pulse of acetic 
acid was firstly added and OUR acidI was calculated after its complete assimilation by the 
microorganisms. After that, the biomass was decanted and some of the supernatant is replaced with 
the wastewater sample with the pH previously adjusted to 7.0±0.2.  Finally OUR of the sample was 
measured and biodegradability is calculated (Equation III.9) : 
𝐵𝑖𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦  (%)=(1−(𝑂𝑈𝑅𝑎𝑐𝑖𝑑 𝐼−𝑂𝑈𝑅𝑒𝑥𝑜𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑠
𝑂𝑈𝑅𝑎𝑐𝑖𝑑 𝐼))×100   (III.9)  
Toxicity was also evaluated by means of respirometry. To assess toxicity, the OUR of a new 
acetic acid solution (OUR acid II) was measured once biomass has been in contact with the potential 
toxic sample. If the solution does not have a toxic effect on the biomass, the OUR of the same 
biomass exposed for a second time to acetic acid (OUR acid II) would be the same as the OUR of the 
same reference solution in contact with the fresh biomass (OUR acid I). Consequently, toxicity is 
calculate d as follows in Equation III.10:  
𝑇𝑜𝑥𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 (%)=(𝑂𝑈𝑅𝑎𝑐𝑖𝑑 𝐼−𝑂𝑈𝑅𝑎𝑐𝑖𝑑 𝐼𝐼
𝑂𝑈𝑅𝑎𝑐𝑖𝑑 𝐼)×100      (III.10)  
III.2.5  Sludge Biotic Index (SBI)  
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the biological treatment and relate it with the 
microorganism consortium present  in the reactor, the biological community was observed by to 
microscopy and its evolution was assessed through the calculation of the Sludge Biotic Index (SBI.)  
The SBI was calculated considering the protozoan community dominant in the activated 
sludge, an d the performance of the biological reactor was classified according to this value.  
A mixed liquor drop is deposited on a glass slide and covered with a slip to avoid any stress 
on the microorganisms. Microscopic observations were held weekly in 25 uL samp les using a 
microscope Motic BA210 with magnification 10X / 0.25.  After identification and enumeration of 
the microorganisms the Sludge Biotic Index (SBI) was determined according to the method described 
by Madoni (2004). This parameter gives the possibil ity of defining the biological quality of the Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
78 sludge using numerical values (biotic index) of 0 -10. Thus, SBI is divided into four quality classes 
Class I (SBI 8 - 10) - biological reactor has well colonized and stable sludge, optimal microbial 
activity an d high removal efficiency; Class II (SBI 6 - 7) - biological reactor has well colonized and 
stable sludge, almost optimal microbial activity and good removal efficiency; Class III (SBI 4 - 5) - 
biological reactor presents an insufficient biological activit y and mediocre efficiency of removal; 
Class IV (SBI 0 - 3) - biological reactor with low biological activity and little efficiency of removal.  
  III. ANA LYTICAL METHODS AND EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE  
79 III.3  Experimental Procedure  
III.3.1  Coagulation Set -Up 
The coagulation/flocculation and sedimentation tests were performed i n a standard jar test 
apparatus from Velp Scientifica FC6S. It consisted on six beakers with a volume of 500 or 2000 mL 
and stirrers, which could be adjusted to the same stirring conditions for all the beakers. The beakers 
were filled with the sample and t he coagulant/flocculant was added. During the test, no chemical was 
added to control the pH.  
When polymers were applied, mixing time and mixing intensity are of major importance for 
the effectiveness of the process. Mixing after the addition of coagulants generally consisted of two 
successive phases:  
 The first one, a short, intensive mixing phase aimed at optimizing conditions for particle 
coagulant interactions.  
 The second one, a longer, less intensive phase aimed at flocculation of the activated 
particle s to grow strong, large and separable flocs.  
Finally the formed flocks/sludge were allowed to settle during a settling time between 15 
and 60 min . 
III.3.2  Fenton Set -Up 
Chemical oxidation by Fenton’s of industrial wastewaters was conducted in a stirred jacketed 
glass batch reactor, at ambient temperature.  
The reactor (0.5 or 1.5 L capacity) was equipped with a magnetic stirrer for continuous 
stirring of the reaction mixture (500 rpm), and a thermocouple and a pH meter were used to assess 
the temperature and the pH  in the liquid phase. In other studies, the Fenton experiment was performed 
in a jar -test (Velp Scientifica FC6S with a maximum speed of 250 rpm). The pH is monitored, using 
a pH -meter. Samples were taken periodically Fenton oxidation experiments started b y correcting the 
effluent’s pH to the desired value. Apart from the pollutants, the initial solution also contains Fe (II) 
which was added in the form of iron sulphate heptahydrate. The iron concentration in the solutions 
was calculated taking into account  that hydrogen peroxide would be added later, bearing in mind the 
molar (at lab scale) or massic (at industrial scale[H 2O2]: [Fe2+] ratios and [H 2O2]: [COD] relations.  
Special attention has to be paid when surfactants are present in the initial effluent in  order to avoid Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
80 foaming during its preparation. Iron hydrolysis was found to affect Fenton’s process efficiency 
(Pignatello et al., 2006). In order to avoid it, the mixtures are immediately used after their 
preparation. A known volume of hydrogen peroxide 30% w/v commercial solution was added to start 
the reactions. Simultaneously, blank experiments without hydrogen peroxide were performed. 
Fenton reaction, due to the homogeneous nature of the catalyst, can continue in sample vials. Thus, 
samples alkaliniza tionat pH 11 -12 can be used to rapidly decompose hydrogen peroxide and 
precipitate iron, instantaneously stopping the reaction after the withdrawal of samples. Pre 
determinate volumes of NaOH 3M solution were added into the sample vials prior to introduce the 
sample .  
III.3.3  Ozonation Set -Up 
The experiments were carried out in a lab -scale reactor (ca. 1 L or 1.5L) with magnetic 
stirring. In each test the reactor was filled with 700 mL or 1000 mL of wastewater, at the desired pH. 
Ozone was produced from a pure oxyg en stream in a BMT 802N ozone generator. The experiments 
were performed at constant gas flow (500 cm3 min-1, measured at room T and P) and constant inlet 
ozone concentration.  
The concentration of ozone in the gaseous phase was monitored with a BMT 963 vent  ozone 
analyzer. In other studies a C -Lasky C -L010DS (AirTree) was used, with a concentration of 5 g.h-1, 
also producing ozone from a pure oxygen stream. The  ozone leaving the reactor was destroyed by 
passing the outlet gas stream through a KI solution (2% ) (Martins and Quinta Ferreira, 2009).  
When hydrogen peroxide was added, it was always fed after the ozone flow starts to enter 
into the system .  
III.3.4  Biological Reactors  
Aerobic  biological  oxidation experiments were completed in a 1.5L and 0.5 L stirred tank 
reactors. The reactors were equipped with an air diffuser in which an airflow rate is continuously 
supplied and distributed uniformly all over the reactor, also assisted by agitation that makes the 
solution inside the reactor homogenous.  
The biomass used w as activated sludge from an agro industrial wastewater treatment plant. 
For the bio -oxidation the procedure was as follows:  
The reactor was operated at semi -continuous mode and was initially charged with the 
following mixture:  III. ANA LYTICAL METHODS AND EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE  
81  biomass from a WWTP : 
 wastewa ter. 
Daily procedure with the reactor was as follows:  
 The magnetic stirring was stopped and the reactor air feeding was stopped to allow the 
biomass to settle down during 1 hour;  
 A determined volume of solution was taken out;   
 The reactor was fed with fr esh solution equal to the corresponding wastewater 
solution/macronutrients mixture, previously neutralized at pH 7 -8;  
 The liquid level was still maintained constant by the addition of water;  
 The air flow and the stirring were restarted . 
In order to enhan ce the system performance, specifically selected bacteria provided by Bio -
System Europe (Bioaugmentation) were added to the sequencing batch reactors (SBRs), and the 
comparison between the attained efficiencies of the simple and the bio augmented system wa s 
performed .

   IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
83 IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISC USSION  
IV.1  Introduction  
The industrial production promotes the release of diverse effluents containing an almost 
incalculable variety of pollutant compounds into the environment. Thus, it reveals to be an intense 
source of pollution with aconsequent devastati ng impact in aquatic life. Some of these compounds, 
due their stability, some inherent toxicity but mainly non -biodegradable nature, are not able to be 
treated under usual treatment methods as separation and aerobic biological processes.  Due to this 
refra ctory effect, it is necessary the application of specific treatment methodologies in order to 
accomplish the enforceable legislation.  
In this context, the Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have arisen as options of 
remediation treatment to destroy the re calcitrant pollutants existents on these wastewaters. It is 
possible to attain the main goal through the single use of these processes; however they should be 
integrated with biological processes to reduce reactants and energy requirements.  Among the 
existent AOPs, the homogeneous processes as Fenton and Ozonation are of notable interest. In fact, 
these systems accomplish the intended degradation extension with an acceptable operational cost  
One of the crucial points in the development of these works is th at the research carried out 
had as main objective the development of a complete treatment system that can effectively remediate 
each specific effluent. Usually a coagulation step is required when delaing with real effluents since 
the solid content may affe ct the oxidative reaction.  
As mentioned above, even if the proposed oxidative process is able to reach the main goal 
leading to an effluent able to be discharged, the verification of the possibility of applying a biological 
process is essential in order to  not only achieve an economically and viable treatment.  
In the present section, the studies involving both Fenton and Fenton -like Processes applied 
at bench scale to depurate three different effluents as Olive Mill, Elderberry and Winery processing 
wastewa ters are present in Sections IV.2. - IV.5. Below is given a resume of the develop works.

treatment for the olive mill wastewaters  
(Nuno Amaral -Silva, Rui C. Ma rtins, Sérgio Castro -Silva and Rosa M. Quinta -Ferreira , 
Environmental Technology (submitted))  
This study evidence a treatment system involving the integration of coagulation/flocculation 
and Fenton processes to depurate a two phases olive oil production mi ll effluent, where the removal 
efficiencies obtained from the coagulation/flocculation experiments showed similar phenol and COD 
results (82 and 84% respectively) as well as a BOD 5/COD improvement (0.20 against the initial 
0.05).  
Furthermore, the combinat ion of the physical separation stage followed by the chemical 
Fenton’s oxidation, allows a COD and TPh reduction up to 90% and 92% respectively. The treated 
stream biodegradability (BOD 5/COD) reached 0.52 and the Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and Total 
Dissolved Solids (TDS) decreased 95% and 69% respectively.  
Section IV.3 presents a complex and refractory to biological oxidation agro -wastewater 
coming from elderberry juice production, where the effectiveness of the Fenton’s process was 
investigated.  
 
Sectio n IV.3: Fenton’s treatment as an effective treatment for elderberry effluents: 
economical evaluation  
(Nuno Amaral -Silva, Rui C. Martins, Sérgio Castro -Silva and Rosa M. Quinta -Ferreira , 
Environmental Technology (http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2015.110 7624)  
The present research work main goal was the selection of adequate cost -effective operating 
conditions suitable to lead to a final treated wastewater within the legal thresholds to be discharged 
into the natural water courses. . The Fenton’s oxidation  was able to decrease at least 70 % of COD 
(corresponding to a final value below 150 mgO 2.L-1, achieving the total phenolic content 
degradation). The results showed average removal efficiencies of COD, TSS and color of about 78%, 
90% and 63%, respectively,  and a BOD 5/COD improvement of 600%, from 0.05 to 0.3.  
Within these conditions, the resulting effluent is able to be directly discharged into the natural 
hydric channels. Nevertheless, the costs may be reduced if the aim is to reach a biodegradable stream 
able to be directed to the municipal wastewater treatment plant that can successfully biologically 
further amend the effluent.   IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
85 Section IV.4 presents the study of a physicochemical pre -treatment to enhance a posterior 
biological depuration of a Winery Wast ewater (WinW).  
 
Section IV. 4: A new winery wastewater treatment approach during vintage periods 
integrating ferric coagulation, Fenton Reaction and activated sludge  
(Nuno Amaral -Silva, Rui C. Martins, Cláudia Paiva, Sérgio Castro -Silva and Rosa M. 
Quint a-Ferreira , Environmental Technology (submitted))  
A two stage process, involving coagulation and Fenton’s -like oxidation, was used for the 
treatment of winery wastewater. The main objective of this sequence was to enhance biodegradability 
so that a posteri or aerobic biological depuration could be possible. The chemical processes (initial 
pH of 3, [Fe 2 (SO 4)3] = 1500 ppm , [H2O2] = 1.18 L.m-3effluent ) led to global COD removal of 56.6 %. 
Besides, a biodegradability enhancement of 60% was attained reaching a B OD 5/COD ratio of 0.4.  
The operation costs were assessed for this stage, showing that the proposed methodology entails a 
cost of 0.27€ per kg of COD removed. Moreover, the further refining of the effluent using a 
Sequential Batch Reactor (SBR) had a mild p ositive effect over COD removal. The final COD 
abatement was 74% (145 mg O 2.L-1). Moreover, dissolved iron reached a value below 1 mg.L-1 after 
the biological treatment. Under these conditions, the final stream was within the legal limits for direct 
discha rge into the hydrological resources. Thus, it was concluded that the proposed methodology is 
able to satisfactorily treat winery wastewater even during the peak period of winery effluent 
production.  
The section IV.5 presents the extrapolation of the lab t est results to an Industrial WWTP, 
showing that a simplified process combining the Fenton oxidation coupled to a previous coagulation 
stage is able to depurate the OMW.  
 
Section IV.5: From a lab test to industrial application: scale -up of Fenton -process as  real 
treatment to olive mill wastewater  
 (Nuno Amaral -Silva, Rui C. Martins, Paulo Nunes, Sérgio Castro -Silva and Rosa M. Quinta -
Ferreira , Journal of Water Process Engineering (Submitted))  
This work studies the integration of ferric coagulation, Fenton ox idation, at lab and industrial 
scale on the treatment of olive mill wastewater. The first stage, an iron based coagulation promotes  
40% of solids removal (laboratorial) and COD abatement of 38% to laboratorial and 43% average to Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
86 industrial scale. The Fent on oxidation where iron (II) and hydrogen peroxide were added attains 
COD removals of 75% at laboratorial and 62% average  at industrial scale.  
At the industrial WWTP the ferric coagulation followed by Fenton’s peroxidation was 
completed with consequent neu tralization/flocculation, achieving mineralization efficiency up to 
90% and a final COD of 200 mgO 2.L-1. Moreover, biodegradability was improved (from initial 
BOD5/COD average =0.03 to final BOD 5/COD average =0.37) favoring a posterior biological treatment. 
The result of the integration of the industrial treated wastewater with biological oxidation performed 
at laboratorial scale shows that the microorganisms need an adaptation time, reaching an average 
efficiency of 68% until the day 23. However, at the end of  the 60th day, the biomass was totally 
adapted, presenting a high efficiency treatment, supporting 86% of COD removal increasing from 
this day on until the end with a final a remarkable degradation of 95%.  
The following sections presents the performed work s where the ozone was the main oxidant 
in order to treat three different wastewaters: landfill leachate, high refractory industrial automotive 
coating tubes, chemical production wastewater, but also carrot washing wastewater.  
Section IV.6 presents the stu dy in order to develop a treatment to Landfill Leachate coming 
from a Reverse Osmosis system.

Landfill Leachate  
(Nuno Amaral -Silva, Rui C. Martins, Sérgio Castro -Silva and R osa M. Quinta -Ferreira , 2015 
Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering )  
Landfill leachate effluent as the permeate stream from a reverse osmosis treatment  presents 
a very low biodegradability (BOD 5/COD = 0.05) being resilient to biological processes. The leachate 
is characterised by moderate COD value, 1880 mg O 2.L-1, very low biodegradability (BOD 5/COD = 
0.05 and 2 % for respirometric measurement) and an intense dark brown colour. The depuration of 
the landfill leachate by ozone was favored when high p H values were applied or when hydrogen 
peroxide was used as co -oxidant.  
The best achieved result was derived from the O 3/H2O2 process using 4 g H 2O2.L-1, with a 
COD depletion up to 44%, and an increment of a BOD 5/COD to 0.27, with a respirometric 
biodegrad ability of 29% and colour removal of 87% at pH 9 that enables the treated wastewater 
discharge for the local sewage collector. Moreover, single ozonation also promoted a removal of the IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
87 recalcitrant organic matter of 43% of COD and increased leachate biodeg radability, BOD 5/COD to 
0.22, which makes this process a viable option as a pre -biological treatment.  
The study showed that single ozonation and ozone combined with hydrogen peroxide are 
efficient methods to treat this leachate. Biodegradability indicated  by BOD 5/COD and respirometric 
tests can be significantly enhanced when ozone is applied.   
Section IV.7 presents a different objective of treatment aiming the availability of the 
wastewater reuse. Two distinct effluents (Vegetable Wash (VW) and Chemical P roduction (CP) 
wastewaters) were tested.

The present scarcity and the augment with the costs of water acquisition increase the interest 
and need of water savings, reclamation and reuse in industry. The search for an efficient and 
economical method to the depuratio n of two different effluents was investigated by advanced 
oxidation processes as direct ozonation and O 3/H2O2 focusing in the evaluation of their effectiveness 
for decomposing COD and TOC aiming water reuse.  
The O 3/H2O2 combined system (with hydrogen perox ide concentrations of 3.6 mmol.L-1 and 
35.7 mmol.L-1 were selected for VW and CP depuration), showed the highest oxidizing power 
amongst the two ozonation methodologies with stronger COD and TOC degradation degrees 
corresponding to 100% (0 mgO 2.L-1) and 33 % (38 mgC.L-1) after 120 min for the VW and 96% (38 
mgO 2.L-1) and 66% (62 mgC.L-1) for the CP after 180 minutes of oxidizing procedure. In other way 
the single ozonation leads to COD reductions of 87% and 41%, TOC content removals of 13 and 
26% and a TSS d ecrease of 70 and 66% for VW and CP respectively.  
At the end of treatment, the treated water could be reintroduced in the washing vegetables 
operation, and the final CP effluent could be used in the irrigation or in the other applications existent 
in the f actory layout.  
Environmental constraints, especially in relation to existing hydric resources in protected 
areas, have been raising serious problems to comply with respect to legislation imposed on diverse 
types of industry. Section IV.8 presents one of th ese cases, where suddenly appears a huge problem Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:

During the evaluatio n of the best methodologies to treat this complex wastewaters, several 
approaches were taken, as such as Coagulation, Fenton’s reaction and Ozonation integrated or not 
with biological processes.  
Physical -chemical treatment as coagulation presents a maximum  removal of 23.5 and 6.2 % 
of TSS and COD, respectively. On other way, the Fenton oxidation leads to a COD value of 2370 
mgO 2.L-1. The unique depurative methodology that would be able to attain an effluent with so lower 
level of organic matter was ozonatio n. Several parameters affecting Ozonation, such as pH, the 
addition of hydrogen peroxide as co -oxidant and the contact time, were optimized.  
It was concluded that the best efficiency is attained with ozone using a multi -stage pH. After 
1200 min of reactio n, this system with different stages induced by pH variation, led to 98.2 % of 
COD degradation with a final COD value of 220 mgO 2.L-1to and the final effluent presented a 
biodegradability improvement of about 260%. It seems that the initial acidic conditio ns are able to 
remove radical scavengers which will enhance hydroxyl radicals’ action during the alkaline stage .  
  IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
89 IV.2  Integration of traditional systems and AOP´s 
technologies on the industrial treatment for the Olive Mill 
Wastewaters  
IV.2.1  Introduction  
Olive oil production is one of the most important agro -industries in countries located near 
the Mediterranean Sea. However, such mills are normally located in areas  with long  plains and  dry 
climate, where  water stress  is an issue (Rizzo et al., 2010) . Moreover, duri ng olives processing the 
generation of enormous quantities of wastewaters (OMW - olive mill wastewater) and solid wastes 
occur, whose management, treatment and safe disposal (Mavros et al., 2008)  becomes a serious 
problem arising the apprehension of local  environmental  institutions. Those wastewaters (OMW) are 
characterized by high organic content involving pollutants, such as polyphenols, that may exhibit 
toxic properties (Andreozzi et al., 2008)  with strong resistance towards the degradation by activated  
sludge microorganisms. In that way, OMW direct release can generate numerous risks to the 
environment and it is necessary to develop suitable treatment schemes.  
Nowadays, one of the most common applied methods is the OMW storage in lagoons, 
followed by e vaporation during the summer season (Erses Yay et al.,  2012) . However this procedure 
reveals serious drawbacks such as low efficiency and sludge -disposal problems since it can only 
concentrate OMW to the extent of 70 -75%; besides, it favors the separation/ dehydration (Jarboui et 
al., 2010) and not as much organic matter degradation (Diamadopoulos et al., 2006) . Other used 
processes are biological treatments, ineffective in practice. However , when  combined with chemical 
or physical systems, the reduction of the OMW pollutants can be drastically improved (Erses Yay et 
al., 2012) . In the last few years, a great effort of the scientific community was performed in order to 
develop efficient treatments schemes for OMW. In this sense, several methods have been prop osed 
with a main incidence in physical -chemical methodologies (Mavros et al., 2008) . Initially, a 
preliminary step to remove solids, color and odor is needed which is usually associated to the 
elimination of compounds like polyphenols, therefore reducing t he initial polluting load on the 
formed sludge (Rizzo et al., 2010; Agalias et al., 2007) . Nevertheless, the treated wastewater is 
unlikely to meet discharge limits and it is necessary to incorporate chemical and/or biological 
oxidation approaches (Andreoz zi et al., 2008). Such is the case of electrocoagulation treatment 
(García -García et al., 2011) , Fenton (Bautista et al., 2008), ozonation (Cañizares et al., 2007) , 
peroxidation techniques (Ginos et al., 2006) and electrochemical oxidation (Gotsi et al., 2005; 
Deligiorgis et al., 2008).  Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
90 The advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are arising as suitable technologies able to 
degrade bio -refractory pollutants through hydroxyl radicals that are powerful oxidants leading to 
very efficient oxidation processes. The A OPs have potential to achieve total degradation of the 
pollutants. However, with proper optimization, these processes can be applied with the objective of 
improving biodegradability due to the partial oxidation of the initial contaminants rather than aimin g 
total mineralization. This approach may lead to lower operating costs. In this context, it is worthwhile 
to strengthen that no additional energy input is required to activate H 2O2, hence this is a cost effective 
method to generate (HO•) (Bautista et al.,  2008;  Lucas and Peres, 2009) . On the other hand, Fenton’s 
reaction involves reagents like iron and hydrogen peroxide that are safe, nontoxic, easy to store and 
easy to handle without environmental danger.  
However, AOP s can also origin products more toxic  than the original compounds if reactions 
are incomplete.  This is the case of the Fenton reagent, a cost effective method, easy to apply, 
involving a mixture of hydrogen peroxide whose decomposition into those radicals is promoted by 
iron salts (Lucas and  Peres, 2009).    
Fenton’s application generally entails four stages: pH adjustment, oxidation, neutralization, 
coagulation and precipitation (Benatti et al., 2006) . This type of technique may not guarantee that 
the resulting treated water is suitable to be  disposed into the natural hydrological resources, but in 
most of the cases, the partial oxidation of the parent pollutants enhances the effluents’ 
biodegradability, that permits the posterior application of a biological system to finally fulfill the 
legal  limits for discharge (Martins and Quinta -Ferreira, 2009; Kallel et al., 2009) .  
The economic factor is another restriction due to the high operational costs when high 
strength wastewaters are involved, that would require great amounts of catalyst and oxid ant (e.g. 
H2O2). Moreover, the costs associated with the disposal of the sl udge produced at the end of the  
Fenton’s process must be considered as well (Cañizares et al.,  2007 ). 
 The aim of this work focused the optimization of  an industrial unit that  suffe red a sudden 
variation in  the inlet OMW composition namely in what regards parameters  such as  Total Phenol 
Content (TPh), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). In this ambit, one  of the main objectives  is to 
observe the  possibility of avoiding  the pH adjustment  before the Fenton  process  and if it is 
possible  to reduce the final amount  of ferrous sludge  by dispensing  chemical precipitation   through 
a simple coagulation, in order to evaluate whether  pH adjustment  and respective alkalization would 
be unnecessary step s. Those proposed modifications have the main purpose of simplifying the 
industrial procedures and reduce the investment and operational costs, through the reduction of 
chemicals dosage and equipment, as well as to improve and reduce the required operation al time into IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
91 the different stages. So an alternative to the OMW treatment was proposed based on the combined 
use of coagulation and a modified Fenton oxidation. In this context, the operating conditions effects, 
such as type and concentration of coagulants  and flocculants were assessed besides the importance 
of Fenton’s reactants load. The efficiency of the different methodologies was analyzed regarding 
TSS, TPh and COD removal as well as biodegradability enhancement in order to permit the 
wastewater dispos al into the local collector to be further refined in the biological municipal 
wastewater treatment plant.  
Within this context, the main goal of this research was to achieve a full scale treatment 
methodology to improve the efficiency of an existent Wastew ater Treatment Plant. For this purpose, 
all the treatment methodologies must be assessed taking into account operational cost restrictions, 
and ensuring that all processes can be performed without high investments. The aim was to reach a 
treated effluent w ithin the limits for discharge in the sewage so that a proper biological refining 
would be possible in a municipal wastewater treatment plant.  
IV.2.2  Materials and methods  
This research work aimed to study the efficiency of commercially available coagulants and 
flocculants provided from a company that is our spin -off. It should be strengthened that the goal was 
to reach a treatment scheme able to be industrially implemented. Thus, it was necessary to rely on 
chemicals that are easily available.  
 All chemicals wer e of analytical grade, and were used without further purification. Stock 
solutions were prepared in double -distilled water. pH of reaction solutions was adjusted using H 2SO 4 
30% (w/w) and NaOH 3M aqueous solutions.   
IV.2.2.1  Olive Mill Wastewater (OMW)  
The e ffluent used in this study comes from a two -phase extraction procedure, with a dark 
red-brown color, was taken from an Olive Oil Production Plant (OOPP) located in 
Extremadura  region of western central Spain. The physicochemical characterization of this Ol ive 
Mill Wastewater is presented in Table IV.2.1 . This effluent  comes from the  end of the process  and 
presents  a high pH  due to the use  of caustic soda  for cleaning  boilers and  the production machinery, 
and was collected in March, two months after the end of olive oil production. The wastewater comes 
from the storage lagoon that receives all the waters streams from the olive oil mill operation and 
installations layout. This stream is characterized by an elevated phenolic content, 547 mg.L-1, a very 
high org anic load, 12180  mg O 2.L-1, and a very poor biodegradability¸ BOD 5/COD=0.05 .  Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:

IV.2.2.2  Coagulation/flocculation p rocedure  
The efficiency of the coagulation/flocculation process was considered under several pH 
conditions (5, 7 and 10), and different coagulant dosages (in the range 0.25 to 2 g.L-1). The pH and 
coagulant concentration ranges were imposed by the company responsible for the industrial treatment 
plant in order to reduce costs associated with those reagents.  Coagulant concentrations bellow 0.25 
g.L-1 showed no removal of any of the parameters under consideration.  
Coagulation and flocculation experiments wer e carried out in a jar -test apparatus equipped 
with six beakers of 600 mL capacity. The effluent pH was adjusted to the desired value. In a typical 
coagulation run, the appropriate load of coagulant in the range 0.25 -2 g.L-1 was added directly to 300 
mL of  OMW and the flocculants were inserted afterwards in order to promote the aggregation of the 
colloidal and solid particles, by enhancing flocks formation (Diang et al., 2007) . After 1 min of 
agitation at 150 rpm, the coagulant was introduced drop by drop a nd left for 5 min to coagulate 
particles. The stirring speed was then reduced to 30 rpm for 15 min to allow flocks growth. For the 
flocculation of the coagulated suspension, the flocculants were added under rapid mixing before the 
flocks are left to settle  down during 30 min. After, the supernatant was separated off for the relevant 
analysis. This experimental procedure is similar and adapted from the proceeding reported by 
(Eckenfelder, 2010).  
IV.2.2.3  Fenton Oxidation Procedure  
The Fenton tests were executed using  ferrous iron sulfate (FeSO 4.7H 2O) and hydrogen 
peroxide (H 2O2, 30% w/w) at ambient temperature. Wastewater samples were introduced in a beaker 
and stirred; pH was adjusted to fixed values if necessary, the Fe2+ dosage was achieved by the 
addition of the n ecessary amount of FeSO 4 .7H 2O and reaction started when  a known volume of 
30% (w/w) H 2O2 solution was added in a single step. Afterwards, some runs were conducted with 
partial H 2O2 addition in equal aliquots during the reaction time.  
To all withdrawn sa mples a pre -quantified NaOH 3M volume was added in order to raise the 
pH to 12, to decompose the residual hydrogen peroxide and precipitate the iron sludge before 
performing the necessary analysis.  IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
93 IV.2.2.4  Analytical Methods  
The removal and transformation of reca lcitrant organic matter, by coagulation -Fenton 
oxidation processes, was evaluated by measuring COD, TPh, BOD 5, TSS and TSD. The procedures 
proposed by the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater (Greenberg et al.,  
1995)  were used to de termine the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biochemical Oxygen 
Demand  (BOD 5), Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), while for Total 
polyphenol content (TPh) determination, Folin -Ciocalteau protocol was followed as described in 
detail  elsewhere (Martins et al.,  2008) . Changes in solution pH were detected with a Crison micropH 
2000 pH -meter.  
For the COD, TPh, BOD 5, TSS and TSD measurement, the withdrawn samples were 
analyzed in triplicate to minimize the experimental error. The deviatio ns between runs were always 
lower than 2% and 5% for COD and TPh. In what regards BOD 5, TSS and TSD, the highest deviation 
was lower than 16% . 
IV.2.3  Results and discussion  
IV.2.3.1  Coagulation/flocculation  
For the coagulation/flocculation tests four coagulants, 19F, P1 9, P20 and POLIPAX, were 
used while the flocculants so -called 2045 -SJO and 4490 -SH were kindly provided by 
ADVENTECH.  
IV.2.3.1.1  pH selection  
Preliminary experiments were performed to assess the more efficient pH for the coagulant 
P19, previously used at the real s cale OOPP from where the effluent comes. For different coagulants 
doses three tests were executed at different pH (10, 7 and 5). Indeed, to be able to use pH below 5, 
pipes, pumps and tanks made of more resistant materials would be required, increasing t he 
installation costs.  The removals of COD and TPh with P19 are depicted in Figure  IV.2.1a) and 
IV.2.1b), respectively.  Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:

It can be observed that concentrations of coagulants lower than 0.5 g.L-1 are ineffective  to 
cause significant COD decrease. The best results were obtained for pH =5 and a coagulant content 
of 0.75 g.L-1 which enables a COD removal around 80%. For the remaining pH values tested a COD 
reduction was also possible to be obtained, but the treated wastewater still presented a dark color and 
some organic matter in suspension. In what concerns TPh a batement, similar behavior was presented 
for pH 7 and 10 until 0.75 g.L-1. The optimal was attained with 40% degradation being achieved for 
pH 5 and 0.75 g.L-1 of coagulant, most likely due to the fact that the effluent pH controls the 
hydrolysis species t hat endorse positive or negative charges. These species are positively charged at 
acidic pH and negatively charged at neutral and alkaline pH. The positively charged hydrolysis 
species can absorb on the colloidal particles surface originating the destabili zation of the colloidal 
particles, being this mechanism entitled as ‘charge neutralization’. These formed precipitates can 
physically agglomerate the colloidal particles in suspension resulting in cleaner wastewater and 
stable flocks leading to quick sedim entation. In fact, the majority of colloidal particles are negatively 
charged and a lower pH contributes to destabilization (Moghaddam et al.,  2010)  consequential 
agglomeration and posterior sedimentation as it was desired .

coagulation process at pH=5  
In these experiments the coa gulant dosage was increased stepwise (0.25 g.L-1 each time) in 
order to evaluate the minimum amount required to achieve separation. Increasing those quantities 
from 0.25 g .L-1 to 1.5 g .L-1 led to a COD removal augment to more than 80% in all the cases. W hile 
for P19 and 19F, 80% COD decay was observed at 1 g.L-1, for the other coagulants this value was 
only reached for dosages higher than 1.75 g.L-1. A special behavior could be observed for POLIPAX 
with less efficiency for 2 g.L-1, with only 60% reduction , when compared with lower coagulant 
dosages.                                                                                                                                                                                                       
In what conc erns TPh degradation, similar profiles were obtained, with the coagulants P19 
and 19F achieving almost 60% of polyphenol content removal when using 1.75 g.L-1. Higher 
coagulant concentrations also affected TPh elimination decreasing it to 50% for 19F .  
For all tests, as a consequence of particles removal, the observed turbidity decreases for 
higher coagulant concentrations until it reaches a minimum value, then it increases with the addition 
of more coagulant. This is often called partial re -stabilization o f colloid systems by add ition of an 
excess of coagulant  (Sarika et al., 2005) . Since it was intended  to identify  the best  concentration 
range  for the next tests the range  between 1±0.25 g.L-1 (0.75  and 1.25  g.L-1) was selected .

Sarika et al.,  (2005) and Ginos et al., (2006) reported  that the flocculants application  after 
coagulation increased the  organic matter removal efficiency; more specifically originated a COD and 
TPh depletion improvement and a better TSS removal as well. In t his work  the influence 
of flocculants  addition  in the effluent purification was also evaluated. Initially, for  the previously 
selected  pH (5), two flocculants (2045 -SH and 4490 -SJO) were  applied to  the raw effluent.

Figure  IV.2.3  shows the extent of TPh and COD reduction using different concentrations of 
the flocculants yielding 65% and 60% removal of the COD co ntent and 60% and 45% of TPh 
decrease for 0.1 g.L-1 of the flocculants 2045 -SH and 4490 -SJO respectively. In fact, one can observe 
that a minimum amount of 0.05 g.L-1 is needed to allow particles aggregation  and flock formation, 
and that the process effici ency increases when the flocculant load raises up  to 0.15 gL-1. Nevertheless, 
a maximum concentration was  reached after which the addition of   more  flocculants  had practically 
no effect, decreasing even further the process efficiency what is normally attri buted to colloids re -
stabilization  (Sarika et al., 2005) . From these results  it was concluded  that the  flocculant  2045 -SH 
was more favorable  in what regards  solids and respective organic matter removal from the  effluent.  
Moreover,  concentrations  between  0.1and  0.125  g.L-1 lead to  similar  removals; however, as 
the reagents  saving is paramount and it was intended to observe  the synergistic effects  of the selected 
coagulant and flocculant, the selected interval  was 0.075 and 0.125g.L-1 for the combination  of 
coagulation and  subsequent  flocculation experiments.  IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
97 The addition of the organic flocculant 2045 -SH after using coagulant P19 was then examined 
and the corresponding results are presented in Figure  IV.2.4  showing the effect of the overall 
coagulation/flocc ulation process. Several tests were performed aiming to optimize the reactant 
savings and the higher COD removal was attained when 0.1 g.L-1 of 2045 -SH flocculant was applied 
to a previously treated wastewater with 1 g.L-1 of P19 coagulant leading to 82% e limination. 
Similarly  for TPh, that revealed to be more sensitive to the coagulant concentration, those were also 
the best values with 84% abatement.

a smaller COD removal, except on COD re moval when 1.25 g.L-1 of coagulant was used,  
demonstrating that  the interactions are dependent on  the coagulant concentration  in addition to the 
pollutant effluent content. Indeed,  there was  an increase in  COD and TPh depuration when compared 
with coagula ted wastewater without flocculant addition (not presented), but  also the improvement in 
the formation of  large  flocks,  which leads  to an easy sludge sedimentation and a much cleaner 
effluent, achieving  an treated wastewater with  2180  mgO 2.L-1 of COD  and 23 4 mg.L-1 TPh, with a 
BOD 5/COD ratio of 0.20 employing 1 g.L-1 of P19 coagulant and 0.1 g.L-1 of the 2045 -SH flocullant. Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
98 Total  Suspended Solids suffered  a sharp  reduction of more than 90% and Total Dissolved Solids had 
a decrease of 35%.  
These  results show  how essential it is  to apply  a coagulation/flocculation  process  for 
solids  and associated  organic matter  removal, showing that the pollutant content at the solids fraction 
is substantial and responsible at least for 82% of the COD and 59% of TPh.   
Even if  coagulation was able to lead to a significant COD removal (it was concluded that the 
COD content on solids was considerable), the treated effluent still did not fulfill the required 
thresholds for discharge in the municipal sewage. Besides, biodegradabili ty was still insufficient to 
endorse a posterior biological process. Although coagulation/flocculation appears to be a promising 
technology for OMW treatment, it is obvious that special care must be paid to guarantee that the 
resulting liquid and solid pha ses are suitable for further treatment, disposal or use. In this sense, the 
water stream will still require some form of further handling possibly by means of advanced 
oxidation or biological processes or a combination of both.   
IV.2.3.2  Fenton Oxidation  
The pre -treated coagulated wastewater (Operational conditions: pH= 5,                                     
[Coagulant] = 1 g.L-1 of P19 and [Flocculant] = 0.1 g.L-1 of 2045 -SH) was submitted to Fenton’s 
oxidative treatment.  
IV.2.3.2.1  Iron and hydrogen peroxide dosage selectio n  
The Fenton oxidation process can be suitably applicable for the removal of most organics at 
room pressure and temperature. The main parameters, that can affect this system, are operating pH, 
besides Fe (II) and H 2O2 concentrations. In what refers to the  Fenton oxidation, it is well known that 
higher hydrogen peroxide to substrate ratios result in more extensive substrate degradation, while 
higher concentrations of iron ions yield faster rates (Lucas and Peres , 2008) , and the described 
optimum pH for the Fenton process is given as around 3 (Deng, 2007) .  Though this, in order to 
maximize the efficiency of the process, it is necessary to determine the optimal operational [H2O2]: 
[Fe2+] molar ratio (Pignatello et al., 2006 ) which  is usually specific for each  type of pollutants. In 
fact, the Fenton’s reagent ( Equation  IV.2.1 ) is used to produce the hydroxyl radicals required to 
oxidize organic matter. Distinctive issues to be aware are the Fe2+ and H 2O2 dosages in order to avoid 
the resulting undesired HO● scavenging reactions happening in the presence of an excess of each of 
the two reagents. In this case, an optimal ratio between H 2O2 and Fe2+ must be fixed in order to 
minimize scavenging effects (Lucas and Peres , 2008; Kallel et al., 2009) . IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
99 𝐹𝑒 (𝐼𝐼)+𝐻2𝑂2→𝐹𝑒 (𝐼𝐼𝐼)+ 𝑂𝐻−+HO•         (IV.2.1)  
In order to assess such a ratio, maintaining constant the concentration of Fe2+ four tests were 
carried out gradually increasing the dosage of H 2O2 and this way the respective [H2O2]: [Fe2+] ratio. 
The initial value of  H2O2 was calculated  according to the  stoichiometric relationship  between 
the COD  and H 2O2 proposed by  (Lucas and Peres, 2009)  (1 g COD = 0.065 mol H 2O2) and a start 
point was determined  as 10% of that estimated amount, 0.0127 mol of H 2O2 per liter of effluent.  
The initial trials were performed with the [H2O2]: [Fe2+] ratio of 2, 4, 6 and 8 to limit the 
amount of spent iron and in the same way to try to minimize the amount of hydrogen peroxide. The 
best two ratios were selected for the f ollowing stage, the screening of different hydrogen peroxide 
dosages and Fe2+ respective concentration.  This range molar ratios was efficient for this kind of 
treatment (Lucas and Peres , 2009) with  a ratio of 7.5 for the greatest COD removal to treat a di fferent 
OMW.  
One of the effects  to consider  in this treatment  is the abatement of  pH at the reaction start. A 
well-known fact is the pH evolution with the iron load, as greater the amount  of iron promotes  higher 
pH variation. During the oxidation process,  the pH decreases when the iron sulfate is added, and then 
a bigger abatement at hydrogen peroxide addition as it is represented in equations (IV.2.2 - IV.2.3):  
𝐹𝑒 (𝐼𝐼𝐼)+𝐻2𝑂2→𝐹𝑒 (𝐼𝐼)+ HO2•+𝐻+         (IV.2.2)  
𝐹𝑒 (𝐼𝐼𝐼)+HO2•→𝐹𝑒 (𝐼𝐼)+O2+𝐻+         (IV.2.3)  
Another fact that contributes for pH reduction during the oxidation procedure is the 
transformation of a wide range of organic material into intermediary compounds such as organic 
acids and/or hydrogen ions formed b y the redox reactions during Fenton oxidation (Deng, 2007) . 
This pH drop indicates that the mechanisms listed above are present in the reaction medium 
(Pignatello et al., 2006) .  
Given  this, tests were performed  at an initial pH =  5, the pH of the effluent  coming from 
the coagulation/flocculation stage  without  any modification, and  the natural variation of  pH with the 
addition of Fenton’s  reagents was studied. All the experiments were carried out fixing a reaction t ime 
of 2h at no controlled pH.  
As shown i n Figure  IV.2.5 , regardless the  initial wastewater pH  and amount of  reagents 
added  the pH of the effluent  at the beginning of  treatment tends  always  to the same value  near 3.4. Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:

Figure IV.2.5 - Effect of different [H2O2]: [Fe2+] molar ratios on initial pH and COD removal during the 
OMW Fenton oxidation  
It is observed that with  higher  hydrogen peroxide levels, which  means  an increase in 
the [H2O2]: [Fe2+] ratio,  there is an improvement  in the pollutants degradation. For the 
different  tests we obtained  a removal of COD only  between 4  and 9%.  Regarding  TPh reduction, its 
efficiency increases with the  amount of  H2O2. However, with  the use  of ratio 8  (the largest amount, 
IV.2.5 , test a3 there is  a very small  improvement  in the elimination  of these compounds, when 
compared with the previous run with ratio 6, reaching  a maximum of  almost 22% of the total 
polyphenol abatement.  
Given  the small  efficiency obtained,  four trials  were conducted  further with different 
loads  of iron.  The results are shown  in Figure  IV.2.6  with the respective  monitoring of  pH after the 
addition of reactants.

101 Figure  IV.2.6 shows the the extent of COD depletion using different concentrations of iron 
and two different [H2O2]: [Fe2+] ratio (4 and 6 ) consequently involv ing two different hydrogen 
peroxide loads for each iron dosage. The increase in iron load permits a better COD removal. 
However when concentration d was reached , COD elimination attains  a plateau between 42 -45%, 
where higher  iron concentration  promotes  an adverse effect on the performance rate, possibly due to 
the Fe2+ induced radical scavenging (Lucas and Peres , 2008; Gulkaya et al., 2006) . On the other hand 
the radical scavenger effect of H 2O2 is not present because the increased load of this oxidant prom otes 
a slight improvement of the oxidation procedure (as seen previously in Figure  IV.2.5 ). In this way it 
is possible to obtain  a treated  effluent  with a COD  of 1140 mgO 2.L-1 and a TPh concentration of 65 
mg.L-1. The treated wastewater biodegradability wa s also improved to 0.52. In what regards the 
solids, these decreased  considerably, enabling  a reduction of 50% for  TSS and 41% for  TDS for test 
d1 (0.0128 mol of Fe2+, and 0.0507 mol of H 2O2).

Figure IV.2.7 - Biodegrada bility for the different iron and hydrogen peroxide doses  
An interesting feature shown in Figure  IV.2.7 was  BOD 5/COD ratio. It is observe that for 
the same iron dose, the major amount of hydrogen peroxide promotes less biodegradable treated 
wastewater, sh owing that there is an increase on mineralization instead of the formation of 
biodegradable products, or moreover the formed biodegradable species are posteriorly oxidized 
(Trujillo et al., 2006) .  
For a better consumption of the used reagents  it is approp riate to  optimize the reaction time, 
parameter of vital importance in this process  (Diamadopoulos et al., 2006) . For this purpose  a long -
term test (24h) was conducted  with the analysis of the  temporal profile  of COD. This allowed us to 
conclude  that there is an increase on COD  removal up to  180 minutes of  reaction,  but for longer Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
102 times  there is  not an  improvement, so the  experiments carried out  from now on  will have 
this duration in opposition at the previously applied 2 hours.   
IV.2.3.2.2  H2O2 addition methodology ef fect  
The Fenton reaction rate tends to increase when rising the hydrogen peroxide concentration, 
as happened with our previous tests with the same concentration of iron and different loads of H 2O2. 
Exists; however, a limit for the peroxide dose, above whi ch the process performance does not 
improve and may even worsen by the referred radical scavenger effect   (Pignatello et al., 2006) . In 
this sense  two tests were carried out: H 2O2 was either initially totally introduced into the reaction 
medium or added p eriodically along the process  with the total volume of H 2O2 divided in five 
aliquots. The used reactants dosages were those that attained the best results with the smallest amount 
possible, the d1 test, with 0.013 and 0.051 mol of Fe2+ and H 2O2 respectivel y.   Additions  were 
made  immediately after withdrawing samples and the results  are presented below  in Figure  IV.2.8 . 
The curves subtitled as t=t0 represent the situations where the addition  of the oxidant  was carried 
out at a single time in  the beginning o f the  reaction, and t= d (t) defines the  tests where  H2O2 was 
gradually added in  five doses .

Figure IV.2.8 - COD and TPh removal along Fenton’s oxidation operating time and biodegradability 
improvement for unique hydrogen  peroxide load (t=t0) and with aliquot dosage (t=d(t)).  
As can be seen  in the  early period  up to  30 minutes  of reaction  the initial highest 
concentration of  hydrogen  peroxide  increases the  reaction rate  reaching  10% of COD removal  while 
the test with  progr essive additions  attained 6%. However, though during the first hour  of reaction, 
the removal  rate of t=d(t) is lower, after this operation time  the difference decreases reverse,  
reaching  an overall improvement of 10% with   55% COD reduction at the  end of  treatment, while  the 
test t=t0 revealed 45% degradation. In what regards TPh, a higher abatement  is observed when  the IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
103 oxidant  is added  gradually, and  after 30  minutes of reaction  around  50% is eliminated 
while   for t=t0 only 35% is achieved.  Towards the e nd there is  an overall 
improvement  with a marked removal  of almost  80% of  Total  Phenolic  content  compared with the 
71% obtained  when H 2O2 is added in a single  moment.  
 Nonetheless, the biodegradability is lower at the end of the t=d (t) test, with a final 
BOD 5/COD ratio of 0.39 against the 0.44 observed for t=t0, possibly due to the fact that some formed 
biodegradable organic matter have been degraded during the oxidation process in this trial, given the 
fact that COD decreased to 1050 mgO 2.L-1, and thus, t he biodegradable matter is also substantially 
less.  
This process improvement  is probably due  to the fact that  with successive additions  of H 2O2 
the hydrogen peroxide scavenger effect is avoided. The excess in the case where the overall quantity 
is initial ly added could lead to the unwanted consumption of hydroxyl radicals, with subsequent 
formation of hydroperoxyl radicals that present a lower oxidation power. In fact, it is well known 
that hydrogen peroxide may be active as radical generator and as scaven ger or both in simultaneous 
(Gogate and Pandit, 2004).  
 Therefore, the hydrogen peroxide scavenger effect towards hydroxyl radicals can be 
decreased by keeping its concentration at a low level. This can be carried out by periodically adding 
hydrogen peroxi de to the Fenton reactor, decreasing the oxidant waste during the treatment thus 
promoting  a higher rate of  oxidation and  its procedural  efficiency .  
IV.2.3.2.3  Controlled pH effect  
Literature refers that an adequate control of pH would increase oxidation efficiency (Gogate 
and Pandit, 2004; Neyens and Baeyens, 2003) , even if this would increase the operating costs. In 
order  to prove  this effect, one test with  pH control was performed,  where pH  was adjusted  when 
necessary  in order to  be kept  in the range  3.0 ± 0.1, an d the hydrogen peroxide was added 
in five doses, keeping the operating conditions described previously. The removal profiles of  TPh 
and COD  are presented  in Figure  IV.2.9.  Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:

Figure IV.2.9 - COD and TPh removal along Fento n’s oxidation operating tim e for free and controlled pH  
As it is shown, the pre -adjustment of pH and its maintenance within the selected range 
enhanced the COD and TPh reduction rates by Fenton oxidation.  
For the initial 30 minutes of oxidation all the res ults are similar; however, after 60 minutes 
the TPh degradation is favored by maintaining  a constant pH leading to  81% removal  against 71% 
obtained by  the experiment where pH  ran freely. In what regards COD, there is a greater 
improvement after 90 minutes of reaction showing  an enhancement  of around 10%,  enough to 
reach  a COD value of 900 mg O 2.L-1 (53% of COD and 92% of TPh). This allows to achieve the aim 
of this treatment that is focused on the discharge of the treated effluent into a municipal sewage 
collector, which demands a COD threshold value lower than 1250 mg O 2.L-1. However, as occurred 
in the previous test, there was a reduction in the effluent biodegradability when compared with the 
higher attained value (0.39), achieving a BOD 5/COD ratio of 0.3 0, presumably for the same reason 
involving the degradation of the formed biodegradable compounds.  
 Comparing the referred two tests, there is a slight improvement when the pH was controlled. 
This fact  would be  expected,  given that  during the  reaction, th e organic acids  formed as  by-
products  of the degradation of  the polluting compounds  endorse the pH abatement to a value that 
encourage the formation of iron complex species, which react slower with the hydrogen peroxide. 
Also, this oxidant gets solvated in  the presence of high concentration of H+ ion yielding a stable 
peroxone ion that reduces the reactivity with ferrous ion reducing the oxidation extent (Eckenfelder, 
2000). On the other hand, the cited organic acids could  be subsequently  degraded,  thus pro moting 
the pH  increasing of the effluent (Gogate and Pandit, 2004) , which  can lead to  a decrease in the 
process  oxidation efficienc y.  IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
105 IV.2.3.2.4  Coagulation vs NaOH precipitation  
The Fenton’s treatment has two main stages , oxidation which is promoted by hydroxyl 
radicals (HO•) formation and ferric coagulation afterwards (Gulkaya et al., 2006) . The recurrent 
procedure is that at the end of the oxidation treatment the discharge from the Fenton reactor passes 
to a neutralization tank (Bautista et al., 2008) where, by i ncreasing the medium pH until an alkaline 
value (>7), the dissolved iron can be removed by precipitation, and consequently any residual H 2O2 
is decomposed into O 2 and H 2O with the advantage of removing  some organic matter at the same 
time that solid sludge  is formed (Cañizares et al., 2007; Deng, 2007) . 
With the purpose of avoiding the neutralization and posterior acidification for accomplishing 
the wastewater discharge, the  addition of  a coagulant into the treated mixture by Fenton’s  was 
analyzed, aiming t o enable the possible replacement of  the final chemical precipitation stage in order 
to simplify the process and reduce the expenses with reactants and equipment required for their 
dosage. Thus, different  concentrations  of the previously selected coagulant  (P19) used on the  pre-
treatment coagulation/flocculation process were tested, at the end  of the  oxidation procedure. 
Quickly,  it was noticed  the formation of  a film and  in few  minutes  (5-10 min)  a high quantity 
of red mud (about half  of the volume of  the sludge  formed  by precipitation) was  deposited  at the 
bottom of the  reactor.  The results  obtained for the  COD in the supernatant  at the end of the integrated 
process described  are then  shown in Figure  IV.2.10 .

Iron sludge precipitation was only achieved for  concentrations of coagulant higher  than 
0.25 g.L-1.The results prove that the COD removal  is more efficient when chemical  precipitation is 
obtained with NaOH.   But it is our belief that coagulant addition instead iron precipitation is an Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:

106 option that may be  considered  for other  types of effluents depending on the final treatment  purpose. 
This way, the alkalization -acidificati on step can be avoided.

(d1) test during the integrated procedure at controlled pH and with H2O2  gradually added in  aliquots  
 
From Figure  IV.2.1 1 analysis it is possible to conclude that in the first hour, whe re the 
coagulation stage takes place, 82 % of the COD was removed, the total phenol content depletion 
attains 57% and the biodegradability was just improved to 0.20.  In the oxidation process, COD 
decreases 58.7 % while 96% of TPh was reduced. Moreover, a biodegradability improvement to 0.39 
was possible. This reveals that Fenton’s process is an effective methodology to promote organic load 
reduction leading to biodegradability improvement.  
The integrated coagulation -oxidation system allows to attain a robu st process where COD 
and TPh removals globally reach 92.6 and 98.3 % respectively. Besides, BOD 5/COD ratio was 
improved from 0.05 to 0.39 .

107 IV.2.3.2.5  Reactants Cost Evaluation  
An important factor that may restrict the process applicability is related with the opera ting 
costs.  
For this reason it is necessary to perform their evaluation before conceptualizing the physical 
structure of the wastewater treatment plant and determine the investment costs. The costs associated 
with the treatment implementation (constructio n, mechanical instrumentation and maintenance) were 
excluded, mainly because they depend on the site that is available for the plant installation, existing 
equipment, the variability of the wastewater characterization and the volume to treat (Martins et al., 
2010) . For this purpose the coagulant, iron sulfate, H 2O2 and flocculant amounts as well as  NaOH 
and sulfuric acid necessary to prepare the wastewater for the different stages (coagulation, oxidation 
and pH correction) to allow the wastewater discharge  (attained at test d1) were determined. Besides, 
when the main target is an  improvement of the effluent biodegradability with the increase of 
BOD 5/COD ratio the costs associated with that experiment should also be assessed (test b1).  
In order to carry out  the coagulation treatment with the referred doses to achieve the 
discharge limits it was necessary 1 g.L-1 of coagulant as well as 0.1 g.L-1 of flocculant. The pH 
correction to achieve the value of 5 requested 2mL.L-1 of H 2SO 4 30% (w/w).  
 In what regards  the oxidation procedure under test d1, it was necessary to use 1ml.L-1 of 
H2SO 4 30% (w/w) to change the pH to 3.0  ±0.1 and a 1.5 mL.L-1 of NaOH to keep  it in the 
range  3.0 ±0.1. The oxidation treatment required 7.14 ml.L-1 of H 2O2 and 3.5 g.L-1 of FeSO 4.7H2O 
(29.5 % w/w). At the end of the oxidation 2 mL.L-1 of NaOH were needed to adjust the final pH. For 
test b1 half of the H 2O2 and FeSO 4.7H 2O doses were requested.  
 
The price of the hydrogen peroxide 50% was 0.6041 € L−1, the costs of NaOH (50% w/w) 
and H 2SO 4 were 0.366 € L-1 and 0.141 € L-1 and the one of the iron sulphate (29.5% w/w) was 0.2 € 
Kg-1, being each reactant acquired in Portuguese market. The coagulant and floccullant had a price 
of 2 and 4 €.kg-1 respectively.

108 Table IV.2.2  shows the costs associated with the reactants and the global investment required 
for the d1 and b1 tests. As it is possible to conclude, the treatment of each cubic meter of effluent 
through test d1 costs 9.11 € which correspo nds to 0.81 € for each kg of COD removed. The hydrogen 
peroxide has a significant relevance on the total budget corresponding to almost 50% of the total 
reactants charge. If it is intended to increase the biodegradability for a subsequent biological 
treatm ent (test b1), it was possible to achieve a cost of 0.62 € for each kg of COD removed with a 
global cost of 6.61 €.m-3. Comparing both processes, from b1 to d1 it is necessary to spend almost 
more 30% with reactants to remove only 5% more of COD. This show s that the main reasons 
imposing processes integration are predominantly economic aspects, due to the fact that  complete 
mineralization by AOP s treatment results in extremely high costs.  
  IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
109 IV.2.4  Conclusions  
In this study, integrated coagulation/flocculation and Fenton processes were applied for olive 
oil mill wastewaters treatment.  The presented results indicate  that physical, chemical and posterior 
biological processes are able to treat OMW.  
It was observed  that such coagulation stage  coupled to  flocculation  promotes, when 
compared with single coagulation, the solids  formation and a subsequent major organic 
matter  removal by  gravitational  settling; in this physical process the operational parameters that were 
studied were pH and the added dosages of coagulant/fl occulants, being achieved a removal of 82% 
of COD  and 57% of  TPh, with a  BOD 5/COD  ratio improvement to 0.20 spending only 1 g.L-1 of 
P19 coagulant and 0.1 g.L-1 of the 2045 -SH flocculant.  
The further combination with the Fenton process revealed that it is possible to reach larger 
COD and total phenol content abatement (90% and 92%) and a biodegradability enhancement to 0.52 
in relation with the raw wastewater.  
pH adjustment  along Fenton’s oxidation can be avoided at a full scale plant; however  when 
compa red with  pH-controlled  trials,  efficiency   decreases slightly probably due  to the formation 
of intermediate compounds  of acid character, that promote a pH decrement. This will lead to 
oxidation rate decrease due to the formation of complex species [ Fe (H2O).6]2+, which reacted slower 
with hydrogen peroxide. On the other hand,  the addition  of hydrogen peroxide in small aliquots  over 
the time  reaction prevents  the promotion of  the radical -scavenger effect increasing 
the effectiveness  of the overall treatment.   
The final Fenton’s precipitation step also removes organic compounds, indicating that in 
addition to precipitate ferrous sludge, it acts as a polishing stage in what regards to COD removal.  
The optimized integrated system allows to remove 92.6% of COD an d 98.3 % of TPh, 
improving as well the BOD 5/COD ratio to 0.39.  
Consequently, the Fenton process showed a satisfactory COD and phenol depuration 
performance as well as biodegradability improvement revealing therefore that their integration whit 
a biological  treatment step can be an economically viable choice for the OMW before discharge into 
municipal sewages . Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:

IV.3   Fenton’s treatment as an effective treatment for 
elderberry effluents: economical evaluation  
IV.3.1  Introduction  
Curre ntly there is a worldwide need to treat the huge volumes of wastewater caused by 
massive industrial production in order to minimize the associated severe environmental impacts. The 
direct release of these streams is threatening our sensitive and continuous ly scarcer hydrological 
resources. Therefore it is essential to find depuration methodologies able to efficiently remove 
pollutants. However, the costs associated to these technologies are normally a limiting factor for any 
company.  
In the last decades, Ad vanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have been developed and are 
emerging as potential wastewaters treatment techniques  (Jordá et al., 2011 ) showing to be attractive 
for polluting content destruction and consequential COD and/or TOC removal (Padoley et al., 2011), 
biodegradability improvement as well as odour and color abatement  (Chu et al., 2012).  
Amongst AOPs, effluents depuration by Fenton’s process is receiving great attention as a 
promising methodology showing high efficiency for the degradation of a lar ge number of organic 
pollutants and hazard materials. Besides, it is a technology involving low investment costs and simple 
proceedings demanding non -toxic reagents (Fu et al., 2009). Moreover, it still has the advantage that 
can be used as a pre -treatment  stage in order to increase the biodegradability of refractory pollutants 
and diminish wastewaters toxicity allowing the final application of a traditional activated sludge 
depuration  (Cañizares et al., 2009; Mandal et al., 2010).   
This technology is base d on the oxidant power of hydrogen peroxide catalysed by iron ions 
under acidic pH (2 -4), which promotes chain reactions and consequently endorses an effective 
degradation of pollutants through the production of  free radicals such as HO• and HO 2• . Hydrox yl 
radicals are well known as strong oxidants and can oxidize many recalcitrant organic compounds 
(Martins et al., 2010a).  
As Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions are coagulant species, the Fenton process shows a dual function in 
effluents depuration, involving both oxidat ion and coagulation steps, being the sedimentation 
triggered after the neutralization of the treated water originating coagulation of the originated ferric 
hydroxo complexes  (Xing and Sun, 2009 ; Badawy et al., 2009 ; Karthikeyan et al., 2011).  Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
114 The major dra wback of Fenton’s treatment appears to be the requirement of large 
concentrations of H 2O2 and FeSO 4 which can be costly reactants  (Molinos -Senante et al., 2010). 
Moreover, the sludge encompassing iron and organic matter formed at the end of the process ent ails 
management constituting thus another shortcoming of this treatment technology  (Rossi et al., 2011).  
This technique is usually successful in the depuration of agro industrial wastewaters, leading 
to an efficiently COD reduction and increase in the BOD 5/COD ratio, as it was concluded when 
applied  to milk whey effluents (Martins et al., 2010b) and olive mill wastewaters  (Lucas and Peres, 
2009; Martins et al., 2010a).  Diverse applications have already been reported for other types of 
liquid wastes, such  as industrial wastewater (Mandal et al., 2010), textile wastewater (Karthikeyan 
et al., 2011; Rodrigues et al., 2009) and landfill  leachate (Zhang et al., 2005; Cortez et al., 2011).  
In this context, it is proposed to use this oxidative system to favour the depuration of an agro -
industrial effluent, resulting from elderberry juice production. In this industry almost 40% of the 
elderberry initial weight leads to solid and liquid pollutants (Seabra et al., 2010).  
Economic evaluation of treatment units has b een reported in the literature with a greater 
prevalence in recent years (Shaalan et al., 2007; Rodriguez -Garcia et al., 2011). This demonstrates 
the scientific and commercial interest in this type of technology for future applications. However, 
significan t cost issues like construction, mechanical instrumentation and maintenance were omitted 
in order to simplify the analysis, especially because each treatment unit has its equipment 
requirements and components depending on the wastewater characteristics, an d therefore could not 
be considered as orientation (Cañizares et al., 2009).  In this sense, only operating costs have been 
accounted, as they demonstrate if the proposed treatment scheme is viable or not.  
The main objective of the present investigation a ddressed the remediation of an industrial 
wastewater coming from an elderberry juice production by using the Fenton technology, aiming to 
attain a stream legally able to be discharged into the natural hydrological resources. Moreover, the 
operational costs , considering the used reactants were assessed.  
IV.3.2   Material and Methods  
IV.3.2.1  Wastewater  
The wastewater was characterized by a dark -brown color, high amount of suspended solids 
(inducing turbidity, a moderate COD value (620 mgO 2.L-1), low TPh (29 mg.L-1) conten t and an 
extremely low biodegradability (0.05) are presented at Table IV.3.1. In this Table are also described IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
115 the limit values to perform a discharge into the hydrological resources, where one can observe that 
all parameters with the exception of BOD 5 are well above the legal limit of discharge.

IV.3.2.2  Reagents  
All reagents were of analytical grade and were used without any additional purification 
process, such as hydrogen peroxide (50%), ferrous sulphate, mercury sulphate, silver sulphate, 
potassium dic hromate, magnesium sulphate, sulphuric acid and sodium hydroxide (Merck, 
Germany).  
IV.3.2.3  Oxidation Procedure  
The experiments were performed in a jar -test system allowing various runs to be performed 
simultaneously using ferrous iron sulfate (FeSO 4.7H 2O) and hyd rogen peroxide (H 2O2, 50% w/w) at 
ambient temperature. Each 600 mL batch reactor was filled with 300 mL of wastewater and 
continuously mixed at 200 rpm. The experiments were carried out at different Fe2+ and H 2O2 
concentrations in the range of 5 -50 mM and 20-250 mM, respectively (Dogruel et al., 2009). Beyond 
these concentrations, the associated cost by using higher reactants concentrations triggers for not 
bearable prices for further commercial application of the use as discussed later.  
The oxidation proc edure was carried out with the following steps: pH was adjusted around 
the value of 3 (Lucas and Peres, 2009 ; Martins et al., 2010b; Padoley et al., 2011 ) by the addition of 
sulphuric acid (H 2SO 4, 1M) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 3M). At this time FeSO 4.7H 2O was 
dissolved and then slowly mixed with H 2O2. The reaction was considered finished after 4 h. Higher 
reaction times, led to a wastewater purification increase in the order of barely 10%.  
IV.3.2.4  Analysis  
During the experimental period, samples were withdrawn in  certain intervals of time to 
analyze Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD 5), Total Phenol 
Content (TPh), Color, Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS).  Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
116 Chemical Oxygen Demand was acquired by the method specif ied in Standard Methods 5220 
D: closed reflux, colorimetric method. The samples were digested during 2h at 148 ºC in a WTW 
CR3000 thermoreactor (Weilheim, Germany) and the COD value measured in a WTW MPM3000 
photometer. The Folin -Ciocalteau reactant was us ed to determine total soluble phenolics (TPh) as 
described elsewhere (Martins et al., 2008). The dissolved oxygen was assessed by a WTW Inolab 
(Martins et al., 2010c). Color was determined by spectroscopy using a T60 (PG instruments) 
spectrophotometer and the pH was attained using a Crison micropH 2000.  
The Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) were determined by 
Standard Methods: “2540 D: Total Suspended Solids Dried at 103 - 105 °C” for TSS assessment and 
“2450 C Total Dissolved So lids Dried at 180ºC” for TDS evaluation (Greenberg et al., 1985). To 
check repeatability, some experiments were randomly run in duplicate and the samples withdrawn 
were analyzed in triplicate to minimize the experimental error and to check the results 
reproducibility. The deviations between runs were always lower than 5% for COD, TPh and color, 
respectively, below the inherent errors to the employed techniques.  
IV.3.3  Results and Discussion  
This study was carried out in response to an existing problem, where the main requirement 
and the most limiting factor for the process acceptance were constraints of economic nature, mainly 
associated with the related operational costs, as well as the need to discharge the treated wastewater 
into a natural water courses.  Thus,  in accordance with the manufacturer industry, it was set initially 
a maximum value to be expended in reactants (3 € per cubic meter of effluent) and by this value the 
amounts of iron and H 2O2 were assessed. However, after the first assays sequence, it was  noted that 
a higher oxidation level was required to attain the proposed objective (a treated wastewater with a 
COD lower than 150 mgO 2. L-1).  
To make the assessment and selection of the finest operational conditions was initially 
selected the better rati os [H 2O2]: [Fe2+]. Afterwards, were evaluated certain experimental procedures 
in order to establish whether they increased efficiency and subsequently, in a 3rd stage, were selected 
the best chemicals concentrations in order to enhance the efficiency and d iminish the operational 
costs. Therefore, the charges of reagents had to be augmented and so the cost of the process ranged 
from 1.183 until 9.822 €.m-3. These costs are referred to the sum of the two main reactants, H 2O2 and 
Fe2+, and its amount depends o n the [H 2O2]: [Fe2+] ratio. The operational conditions, the resume of 
obtained results referents to COD and BOD 5 as well the costs for each proposed Test are presented 
in Table IV.3.2 . IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

IV.3.3.1  Effect of [H 2O2]: [Fe2+ ] 
Taking into account that H 2O2 is the reactant that has more relevance in the cost of the process 
(Bautista et al., 2008), with the commercial cost of € 200 per ton, the best [H 2O2 and Fe2+] 
concentrations were defined to minimize the required amount of Fenton's reagents in view of its cost, 
taking into account what the greatest amount until the sum of the costs of these two reagents do not 
exceed the 3€ per cubic meter of raw wastewater treat ed.  
Below and above the optimal [H 2O2]:[Fe2+] ratio, the treatment is inefficient or less effective 
due the well know scavenger effect instigated by the excess of reactants. Moreover, as it is well 
known, the Fenton process is comprised by two distinct purification paths, oxidation and coagulation 
where chemical coagulation prevails at a lower [H 2O2]:[Fe2+] ratio, whereas chemical oxidation is 
dominant at higher [H 2O2]:[Fe2+] ratios (Karthikeyan et al., 2011) . The hydrogen peroxide 
concentration was vari ed keeping the ferrous sulphate concentration constant at 10 mM, in the ratio 
of 2:1, 5:1 and 10:1  (mol/mol) respectively.

118 The results depicted in Figure  IV.3.1 a) point out that it was possible to attain a COD removal 
of 65% when a 2:1 ratio (Test 1) was applied and a slight final increase to 68% was detected as the 
ratio reached 5:1 (Test 2) after 4 hou rs of oxidative procedure. However, for the ratio 10:1 (Test 3), 
the COD abatement decreased considerable reaching only 51%.  
Initially, trial 1 shows a greater removal rate; however, after 3 hours of reaction, the rate of 
oxidation of the second trial enh ances awarding a higher wastewater treatment at the end of 4 hours 
of reaction. In fact, this outcome may be originated by the fact that the second trial initially presents 
a greater H 2O2 concentration, which may show a slight inhibition resulting from the  effect of oxidant 
scavenging, which reduces the amount of hydroxyl radicals available for oxidation, forming hydro 
peroxide radicals, HO 2•, with a much lower oxidizing power. During the oxidation, hydrogen 
peroxide concentration drops, reaching a value th at might encourage the increase of the reaction 
efficiency.  
From these results it is then observed that using [Fe2+] =10 mM (Table  IV.3.2 )  the higher 
concentration of H 2O2 (100 mM) is not favorable to the oxidation, achieving almost less 10% of 
removal in  COD and color when compared with the two other tested loads, showing the scavenger 
effect of hydrogen peroxide.  In fact, increasing the hydrogen peroxide quantity may change its 
character from being initiator for the production of hydroxyl radicals that enhance the oxidant power 
of the system to inhibitor of this kind of reactions when in excess.  
For this reason two [H 2O2]: [Fe2+]ratios were selected, 2:1 and 5:1 as the best concentrations 
providing 65% and 68 % on COD removals as it is seen in Figure  IV.3.1. 
In what regards color removal, 1(b), similar results were obtained; the degradation increased 
from 61% (2:1) until 65% (5:1) but for the higher ratio (10:1) the removal is much lower, attaining 
only 55% of color reduction. It is important to refer tha t the Phenol Content was always totally 
degraded during the first hour of reaction.  
IV.3.3.2  Effect of Different Operational Procedures  
Frequently it is mentioned that an adequate control of pH would increase Fenton’s process 
efficiency (Mandal et al., 2010) , since  this is a key parameter on the reaction, playing an important 
role in HO• production; nevertheless, the system pH adjustment increases the operating costs.  
In order to prove this gain, a test with pH control was performed, where pH was adjusted 
within the  range 3 ± 0.1 (test 5). In opposition to this assay, a run without any kind of pH control was 
performed (test 4) and the reactants were added at the raw pH of the effluent (6.7), trying to safeguard 
the operational costs. Moreover, an experiment where pH was only adjusted to 3 initially and IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
119 afterwards left to run freely was performed. It was expected a pH decrease due to the formation of 
some H 3O+ from the reaction of some iron complexes, such as ferric hydroxo with hydroxide ions  
(Ma and Xia, 2009; Martin s et al., 2010b). Complementary, a sequential hydrogen peroxide dosages 
added from time to time  with the total volume of H 2O2 divided in four aliquots (test 6) at each hour 
of reaction was also tested to ascertain whether there might be an improvement in p rocess efficiency.  
The removal profiles of COD and color are presented in Figure  IV.3.2.    
 
Figure  IV.3.2 - COD and color reduction for different oxidation conditions. Conditions: Temp= 20 °C; 
[H2O2]=50 mmol..L-1; [Fe2+]= 10mmol..L-1 
As it is shown in Figure IV.3.2 a), the pH maintenance (Test 5) within the selected range 
seems not to be an indispensable factor regarding Fenton’s efficiency to depurate this effluent, since 
no significant differences regarding COD and TPh removals were observed when compar ing the 
results of Test 4 (no pH correction) and with Test 2 (where pH was corrected only at the oxidation 
begin). After 3 hours of oxidation all the removals are similar; however, from this time on, the COD 
degradation is favored by a free pH in a wastewa ter with previous pH correction (Test 2).  
For the Test 4, where any kind of pH adjustment was performed, it is observed a decrease in 
pH as expected; but with the development of the oxidation, there is a decrease on the process 
efficiency. In fact, there i s a consumption of H 2O2 to favour the formation of H+ leading to the 
production of less efficient hydroperoxyl radicals ( Equation IV.3. 1). Furthermore, as the wastewater 
was about pH 7, some hydrogen peroxide self -decomposition may have been favoured (Mart ins et 
al., 2010c).  
𝐹𝑒3++𝐻2𝑂2→𝐹𝑒2++𝐻𝑂2∙+𝐻+       (IV.3.1)  
In what concerns the case where pH was controlled during time and comparing it with Test 
2, the oxidative systems showed a similar profile and achieved practically the same removal, almost 
40% of COD. In fact, to the pH adjustment a certain quantity of NaOH was added which can favor 
the formation of small quantity of iron hydroxide Fe (OH) 3 which, due to his difficult to solubilize, 
a) 
 b) Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
120 causes the reduction of ferric ions in solution and therefore  a decrease in the process efficiency (Peres 
et al., 2004).  
In fact, during the oxidation, the pH reaches 2.6 ± 0.1 and is maintained in this value along 
two hours of reaction. Then the pH rises and reaches 2.8 ± 0.1 that is kept constant till the end of t he 
process. This fact would be expected, given that during the oxidation organic acids formed as by -
products of the pollutants degradation origin a drop in pH, but its posterior oxididation, will promote 
the slight pH increase (Gogate and Pandit, 2004).  
Surprisingly, the hydrogen peroxide addition along time does not present an efficiency 
improvement, in disagreement with was related by Martins and collaborators (2010a), attaining only 
54% of COD removal beside the degradation of 67% attained for a single oxidant addition (Test 2).  
This result is justified with the fact that a minor concentration of H 2O2 is present during the first two 
hours of oxidation, since only ¼ of the dose of the Test 2 was added, and consequently the latest 
amount could not get rea ction time to a proper consume.  
It is observed, in comparison with all tests that the initial pH adjustment and let it run freely 
afterwards it is preferable before the reaction starts and the pH’s runs freely after its initial correction, 
where it was ach ieved 43% of COD degradation. Besides, all H 2O2 should be initially added.  
In Figure  IV.3.2 b) it is perceived that there is a relationship between operating conditions 
and the final color achieved. Tests with controlled pH led to a higher coloration remov al considering 
that during the Fenton’s reaction with uncontrolled pH its value decreased below 3, resulting in the 
formation of iron complexes, keeping a more intense coloration (Mandal et al., 2010).  
In the aliquots (Test 6) and pH controlled tests (Tes t 5, pH during all the reaction and Test 
2, corrected before the oxidation), this effect was not observed, and the smallest removal is detected. 
In fact, the profile indicates a smaller color degradation rate along time, showing that the lower 
amount of hy drogen peroxide represents a minor degradation on this parameter.  
All the tests assumed an analogous degradation rate profile, indicating that oxidation was 
dependent of the reactants doses, instead of different operational conditions so that in the follo wing 
sections the effect of Fe2+ and H 2O2 will be discussed.  
For all the performed tests total phenolic content was removed at the first hour of reaction.  IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
121 IV.3.3.3  Effect of Fe2+ and H 2O2 Concentration  
In order to assess a better COD depletion, capable of reaching a value below 150 mgO 2.L-1 
that permit the treated wastewater discharge to the hydrological resources, a third sequence of tests, 
where the effect of an increment on the iron dosage was evaluated, maintaining the same studied 
ratios 2:1 and 5:1 was perform ed. The reactants concentrations used in each experiment are present 
in Table IV.3.3 . The ferrous sulphate dose for this effluent depuration was varied in the range of 5 
until 50 mM (in order to guarantee a catalyst dosage up to a maximum where is expected  that more 
oxidizable organic matter is not present) and the hydrogen peroxide dose was varied according to the 
selected [H 2O2]: [Fe2+] ratios. The reaction time was maintained (4h) and pH was initially corrected 
to the value of 3 ranging freely during the  oxidation experiment.

reaches a  remarkable 78% fulfilling the principal objective of this work: a final COD value of 150

In Table IV.3.3 is possible to observe that for higher iron concentration, 50 mM, (Tests 11 
and 12) it is possible to observe a decrease in the COD degradation. Knowing that the Test 11 had 
the same hy drogen peroxide dosage (100 mM H 2O2) that was applied in assay 10 (20 mM Fe2+) one 
can conclude that the differences observed are due to the iron scavenger effect, since there is no 
improvement in the COD removal with a higher iron dosage, but a divergent effect, where is present 
a decrease in the efficiency of the oxidation procedure. For doses lower than 10 mM of Fe2+, COD 
removal diminished remarkably for different ratios (Tests 7 (2:1) and 8 (5:1)), where a higher oxidant 
dosage promotes a major depurat ion, as expected. The worse result was obtained for the Test 12, 
where the higher reactant dosages were used . Comparing the Tests 11 and 12, for the same iron 
concentration, increasing the hydrogen peroxide dosage did not improve COD removal, otherwise 
seems to decrease due to the scavenging effect of H 2O2 on HO• radicals (Padoley et al., 2011)  
previously described. Thus, considering that an increased concentration of reactants does not 
potentiate the oxidation rate, the test 11 conditions with  20 mM of ir on and 100 mM peroxide seem 
to be the most favorable to depurate this wastewater.  
For Fe2+doses lower than 10 mM, COD removal diminished remarkably for both ratios (Tests 
7 and 8). These results reveal that to get a satisfactory COD degradation even if the  required [H 2O2]: 
[Fe2+] ratio is important; the amounts of H 2O2 and FeSO 4 applied are also imperative to produce 
adequate amount of HO• and consequent depuration improvement . 
In what concerns color abatement, from Figure  IV.3.3 b) it is possible to see th at the higher 
used iron concentration attains only 50 % of color reduction (Tests 11 and 12). This result was 
expected since a higher iron dose leads to a higher iron concentration left in solution that in turn 
provides some color to the treated effluent  (besides the higher amount of sludge produced), evidenced 
by the fact that the Test 7 in spite of leading to less COD removal, achieves higher color depletion. 
In fact, the best color removals were perceived when lower iron concentrations were applied, name ly 
test 8 where was attained 65%, the same value accomplished at the tests 2 and 10, both with a [H 2O2]: Fe2+

123 [Fe2+] ratio  of 5 (Table IV.3.3).  There is the exception of test 7, where only 45% of color depletion 
was accomplished which may be explained by the al so low COD abatement detected. Anyway, it is 
emphasized that within those same iron concentrations, tests with higher concentrations of H 2O2, 
provide an upper color removal, because a greater oxidation implies a possible higher degradation of 
the chromosph eres compounds and consequently, a major reduction in color.  
In opposition with the other tests sequence (1 and 2) where was reached the total TPh 
removal, this parameter degradation was not obtained at the first reaction hour for higher dosages of 
iron ( Tests 9 -12) most probably due to the abovementioned scavenger effect ( Figure  IV.3.3 c)). In 
fact, our results show a decrease on TPh removal when the catalyst load increases from 20 to 50 mM.  
For those conditions, complete removal was achieved only after t he 4 hours of oxidation while for 
tests with lower iron concentrations (5 mM at Test 8) this was assessed after 2 hours of reaction.  
IV.3.3.4  Biodegradability Enhancement  
Figure  IV.3.4 exhibits the initial effluent biodegradability ( ) and the minimum value 
reques ted for posterior biological treatment ( ), assuming that when the ratio of BOD 5/COD is 
greater than 0.3, the wastewater is partially biodegradable (Chun and Yizhong, 1999).   
 
Figure  IV.3.4 - Biodegradability of all homogeneous Fenton Tests  
For all tests t he biodegradability was improved. However, only in two of them (Test 2 and 
10), the treated wastewater, seems to be suitable to be depurated by a posterior biological treatment.  
In what respects to the used ratios (2:1, 5:1 and 10:1) in Tests 1, 2 and 3 r espectively, one 
can observe that it exists an increase in the effluent biodegradability for the two first proposed ratios 
values, but for the highest of them (Test 3) the biodegradability accomplished is smaller than the 
Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
124 previous ones (Test 2). This is a classic example of the reactants over dosage effect, namely of the 
hydrogen peroxide scavenger impact, because in addition to the smaller COD removal also lower 
biodegradability enhancement occurred (Badawy et al., 2009).  
In which refers to the many opera tive conditions studied, for all the tests with the same 
reactants concentration, [Fe2+] = 10 mM and a 5:1 ratio (Tests 2, 4, 5 and 6), significant differences 
are found regarding the biodegradability attained. The highest value, 0.29, was accomplished dur ing 
the experiment where pH was corrected before the oxidation procedure, and the worst value, 0.13, 
was reached during the run where hydrogen peroxide was gradually added. The gradual addition of 
hydrogen peroxide could promote the degradation of the form ed biologically degradable compounds 
in the remaining solution leading to a more bio -refractory effluent lessening the COD and the BOD 5 
values.  
Figure  IV.3.5 a) and b) represents the COD removal and the BOD 5/COD profiles resulting 
from the oxidation react ion in function of iron and hydrogen peroxide doses, respectively. From these 
results it is possible to observe that higher ratios (5:1) favors the COD reduction as well as the 
biodegradability improvement when compared with the 2:1 ratio, except for the t est with lower iron 
dosage, that also attained the small COD removal value.  
 
Figure  IV.3.5 - COD and BOD 5/COD in function of iron a) and H 2O2 b) dosages  
According to these biodegradability results, in what regards to the influence of iron 
concentration it is possible to conclude that for a 5:1 ratio, similar effluents biodegradability is 
attained when  iron concentrations of [Fe2+] = 10 and 20 mmol.L-1 are used (Tests 2 and 10), but for 
higher loads an adverse effect exists and less biodegradable by -products are formed (Tests 12). This 
probably derives from the iron scavenger effect, where higher concentrations of this reagent consume 
hydroxyl radicals enhancing the formation of Fe (III) and OH- (Karthikeyan et al., 2011) . Moreover, 
it is reported harmful  effects of the iron excess over microbiological systems which can also

125 contribute for the decrease of measured biodegradability in treated effluent . For the lower iron 
concentration, 5 mM, the degradation of organic compounds (COD) is slighter, and the ob tained 
BOD 5/COD ratio also follows this trend, reaching a value below 0.2 but even somehow higher than 
the one achieved with the greatest iron concentration (50 mM).  
For the [H 2O2]:[Fe2+] = 2:1 the behavior related to the removal of COD and biodegradabili ty 
obtained is similar to the ones referred before, but the values attained for biodegradability are 
considerably shorter for the intermediate concentrations and very similar at the extremes (5 and 50 
mM).  
For the Figure  IV.3.5  b) it is possible to conclu de that for the 2:1 ratio, for a concentration 
of hydrogen peroxide above the 25 mM, there is a slight COD removal improvement, opposed to the 
BOD 5/COD of the treated effluent that goes down sharply. A different behavior is observed for the 
ratio 5:1 where  after reaching the 100 mM H 2O2, there is a reduction in COD removal that in turn is 
accompanied by a decrease of the effluents bio -amenability.  
As mentioned above, the ratio between hydrogen peroxide and iron concentration has a 
strong influence over Fen ton process efficiency. As smaller ratios favor the coagulation mechanism, 
although the COD decrease, there is no oxidation of primary compounds and subsequent formation 
of biodegradable materials, reducing the biodegradability of the effluent. For higher [H2O2]:[Fe2+]=5, 
there is also a maximal concentration that enables purification, from which the oxidant excess 
provides a decrease in the efficacy through the effect of the H 2O2 scavenging behavior already 
mentioned. However, with the reduction of the rem oval of COD, there is a decrease in the same 
proportion of BOD 5/ COD.  
IV.3.3.5  Solids Evaluation  
The results regarding Total Suspended Solids, TSS, and Total Dissolved Solids, TDS derived 
from the Fenton’s process resultant supernatant. Besides the amount of produc ed settable iron sludge 
after alkalization of the reaction medium is present in Figure  IV.3.6 for the different tests performed. 
As depicted in that Figure , there is a strict relationship between TSS and TDS.  With the removal of 
suspended solids by this p rocess, there is dissolution of a significant part of them, providing a 
substantial increase (express at negative removal percentage) in the amount of dissolved materials.  Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
126  
Figure  IV.3.6 - Total Suspended and Dissolved Solids removal during Fenton’s Proce ss (left axis), and 
respective formed Iron sludge (right axis)  
This rise is greater than the amount of removed solids, which suggests that in addition to 
dissolution of the suspended solids there is the formation of solids compounds not sedimentable. 
Beari ng in mind that the main target pollutants of Fenton’s oxidation are organic substances as 
nucleophile and aromatic substances, in opposition to the colloids compounds present in wastewater 
(Dogruel et al., 2009) , it was expected that the colloidal and sus pended matter was removed at a later 
stage throughout pH re -adjustment and favored by the ferric coagulation during the neutralization 
and consequent ferrous sludge formation (Zhang et al., 2006). In opposition, the formed larger 
particle as iron salts, bu t not large enough for a natural sedimentation, shall remain in suspension 
contributing to the increase of TDS (Deng and Englehardt, 2006).  
However, when a higher hydrogen peroxide dosage is used, for the same iron load (major 
[H2O2]: [Fe2+]), a minor qua ntity of iron sludge was produced. This effect is present in the tests 7 -8, 
9-10 and 11 -12, where different H 2O2:Fe2+ were used (2 and 5 respectively), in accordance to what 
is reported (Neyens and Baeyens, 2003 ) where is referred that chemical coagulation  prevails at lows 
ratios, while higher ratios promote the chemical oxidation and consequent reduction of sludge 
volume. This case could be justified by a higher mineralization and consequently a smaller amount 
of settable organic matter available.  It is a lso remarkable, that for iron dosages higher or equal than 
20 mM, the TDS concentration drops more than 50% when compared with the amount formed at the 
test were 10 mM were added. In fact, with the increase of iron concentration is promoted the decrease 
the of TDS quantity, showing that this parameter is strictly related with the coagulation stage, and it 
is necessary to optimize this dosage in order to take advantage of the synergistic effects of both 
phases (oxidation and coagulation) in the Fenton proces s.   
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
127 One important aspect that can be observed is that increasing the amount of iron, provides an 
increase on the quantity of formed sludge. As might be expected, for Fe concentrations of 5 mM less 
than 1g.L-1 of sludge was formed, while for 10 mM resulted  to between 1 -1.5 g.L-1 and for 
concentrations of 20 mM and 50 mM produced about  2 -2.5 g.L-1 and  5 g.L-1, respectively.It is 
possible to observe that the increase in iron load endorses  firstly a better COD removal until 20 mM, 
where the COD elimination s eems to attain a maximum between 70 -78% (Tests 9, 10). Afterwards 
an adverse effect is detected on the performance rate (Tests 11, 12), possibly due to the Fe2+ induced 
radical scavenging (Lucas and Peres, 2009). In the other hand, the difference between t he higher 
H2O2 doses means a more marked improvement on the oxidation efficiency when the lowest iron 
range is used, 5 mM in tests 7 and 8, than for higher values 10 and 20 mM at tests 1, 2, 3 and 9, 10, 
respectively, with a reverse scavenger effect for th e highest iron concentration (50 mM) in the tests 
11 and  12, where trough the selected ratios, the amount of hydrogen peroxide was significantly 
superior, and a scavenger effect is present induced by the excess of oxidant.   
For the strongest COD reductio n (78%), in Test 10, a purified effluent with a COD 
concentration of 150 mgO 2 L-1, total TPh removal, and wastewater biodegradability improved to 0.3 
(BOD 5 < 40 mgO 2 L-1) was possible to be attained. Also for solids, a considerable decrease was 
observed, e nabling a reduction of 90% for TSS (< 60mg L-1, that is the legal threshold that must be 
accomplished by a wastewater for this parameter). This means that the stream is now able to be 
discharged into the hydrological resources entailing an operating cost o f 4.384 € m-3. 
However, for test 2, 52 % of COD removal, a BOD 5/COD improvement to 0.29 and 30% of 
TSS removal was achieved requiring only 2.571€.m-3. Nevertheless, for direct hydric discharge a 
biological step treatment would be necessary to further refin e the wastewater before disposal.  
IV.3.4  Chemical costs evaluation  
In this section it is intended to estimate the operating costs associated to the depuration of 
elderberry juice wastewater by Fenton’s peroxidation. Only the cost of reagents used per m3 of treat ed 
effluent are considered. In fact, these are the only cost that we can infer from the carried activity 
because the associated costs related to the acquisition of equipment and its installation, maintenance, 
electricity, employment and associated costs su ch as transportation and treatment of the originated 
sludge (Molinos -Senante et al., 2010), would only be possible to estimate, in accordance with the 
specific needs of each industrial installation, as volume to treat, wastewater characterization and site 
and area available for the WWTP.   Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:

128 It should be noticed that it was had into account the amount of sulfuric acid to acidification 
of the medium before the treatment, and the addition of NaOH to terminate the reaction and 
precipitate ferrous sludge. Moreove r, the doses of H 2SO 4 and NaOH applied were the same in all 
experiments, except the acid at the Test 4 and the NaOH at Test 6. The costs of the spent reactants 
per m-3 of treated wastewater are present in Table IV.3.4.

Figure  IV.3.7 - COD, BOD 5 and the operational reactants cost achieved for each test  
As it turns out, a significant portion of the cost comes from the amount of H 2O2, standing 
between the 27.1% of the Test 7 until the maximum achieved of 81.7% of the test 12 (Table IV.3.4 ). 
Overall , with the [H 2O2]: [Fe2+] ratio increase, these cost associated percentage increases in the 
process.  
It is possible to observe that the increase in iron load permits firstly a better COD removal 
until 20 mmol.L-1, where the COD elimination seems to attain a maximum removal between 70 -78% 
(Tests 9, 10). Afterwards an adverse effect is detected on the performance rate (Tests 11, 12), possibly 
due to the Fe2+ induced radical scavenging. In the other hand, the difference between the higher H 2O2 
doses means a mo re marked improvement on the oxidation efficiency when the lowest iron range is 
used, 5 mmol.L-1 in tests 7 and 8, than for higher values (10 and 20 mmol.L-1 at tests 1, 2, 3 and 9, 
10, respectively, with a reverse scavenger effect for the highest iron con centration (50 mmol.L-1) in 
the tests 11and 12.  
Thus we can prove that the homogenous Fenton process is effective in this wastewater 
treatment in order to permit to be discharged into ditch water, but it should be consider the possibility 
of a subsequent biological treatment stage in order to reduce the reactants costs. So the advanced 
oxidation process followed by biological process can be an environmental and economic 
advantageous for the treatment of this industrial wastewater.

130 IV.3.5  Conclusions  
The effecti veness of the Fenton’s process as a method for elderberry juice production 
wastewater treatment was investigated. The extent of purification of the treated wastewater was 
dependent on the [H 2O2]: [Fe2+] ratio, but the major significant improvement is deter mined by the 
reactants concentration.  The more suitable ratio for this treatment was 1:5 until a determinate 
maximum iron concentration after which a scavenger effect is promoted and consequential efficiency 
decrease. The wastewater pre -acidification befo re the depuration step (pH adjustment to about 3) 
was beneficial in comparison to when pH control was effectuated during the oxidation process or 
when any kind of pH correction was done. The stepwise addition of hydrogen peroxide did not 
provide benefits w hen compared with the case where this reactant was introduced all at once.  
It was verified a biodegradability improvement for the treated streams.  The results showed 
average removal efficiencies of COD, TSS and Color of about 78%, 90% and 63%, respectivel y, and 
a BOD 5/COD improvement of 600%, from 0.05 to 0.3.  The best treated effluent parameters attained 
with the operational conditions of initial pH=3, [H 2O2]: [Fe2+] =5: 20 mM Fe2+ and a retention time 
of 4h leading to an effluent were within the legal l imits allowing its discharge throughout the hydric  
resources, since the COD and BOD 5 and TSS values accomplish the legal limits for those parameters 
(150 mgO 2 L-1, 40 mgO 2 L-1 and 60 mg L-1 respectively). However, this operational system reaches 
a reactant  costs of more than 4 € m-3. Nevertheless, the costs may be reduced if the aim is to reach a 
biodegradable stream able to be directed to the municipal wastewater treatment plant that can 
successfully biologically further amend the effluent.  
Thus, Fenton’s oxidation can improve biodegradability and reduce COD content until the 
discharge limit, and may possibly be successfully applied both as a single method and as a pre -
treatment stage for increase the biodegradability and/or remove the wastewater organic co ntent for a 
posterior biological treatment approach.

133 IV.4  A new winery wastewater treatment approach during 
vintage periods integrating ferri c coagulation, Fenton 
Reaction and activated sludge  
IV.4.1  Introduction  
Water scarcity is raising some important questions related with the obligation of minimizing 
consume and safeguard the natural water courses.  Liquid effluents reutilization for land irrigati on or 
even for public water supply will decisively contribute for a better management of water resources, 
minimizing the ecological problems associated with the disposal of wastewater into natural 
hydrological systems  (Amaral -Silva et al.,  2012).  
In wine p roduction, vintage occurs for only 3 -4 months. During this stage, wastewaters 
produced encompass strong organic content and high flow rates when compared with the streams 
coming from the remaining periods of winemaking.  
Winery wastewaters (WinW) are charac terized by pH 4 -5, high biochemical and chemical 
oxygen demand (Oller  et al.,  2011). Moreover, the high seasonal features of these streams difficult 
management. Over the years different treatment methodologies were proposed. Among them, 
traditional biologi cal processes are the most widely studied (Arienzo  et al.,  2009). The wineries 
wastewater treatment plants (WWTP's) are normally designed for the vintage period. The off season 
period is characterized by lack of sufficient organic load to maintain an adequ ate biomass 
concentration in the biological reactors.  Thus WWTP are oversized during most of the year. This 
design leads to an increase of the foot implantation and high investment costs. Besides, these 
traditional treatment systems are unable to eliminat e recalcitrant or high molecular weight 
compounds. To solve these issues, the advanced oxidation processes arise as suitable alternatives. It 
should be referred that usually their efficiency increases when associated with a previous 
coagulation/floculation  stage for solids removal and some COD abatement (Kestioglu, 2005; 
Ntampou  et al. 2006; Martins  et al.,  2012). Among these processes, Fenton’s oxidation (Beltran de 
Heredia  et al., 2005; Peres  et al. , 2004; Martins et al.,  2009;  Lucas  et al.,  2009a), ozon ation (Lucas  
et al.,  2010), electrochemical oxidation (Rincon et al., 2009),electrochemical coagulation (Kirzhner  
et al.,  2008), solar photo -Fenton (Ormad  et al.,  2006 ; Anastasiou  et al., 2009 ; Monteagudo  et al.,  
2012) and solar photocatalysis (Rodríguez  et al., 2008) can be referred since they operate at room 
conditions of pressure and temperature.  
Fenton oxidation process (using iron and hydrogen peroxide in an acidic solution) is a 
technique widely used for the destruction of several organic compounds. It is based on the generation Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
134 of free hydroxyl radicals HO• which have a high oxidation potential. Moreover, at the end of the 
process, the ferrous/ferric coagulation promoted under alkaline conditions facilitates the separation 
of some suspended organic m atter (Zhang  et al.,  2005 ; Wu et al.,  2010 ). Fenton process can be 
extremely costly when the aim is total mineralization. Thus, usually this technology is designed to 
promote partial oxidation with a corresponding increase of the wastewater biodegradabilit y favoring 
a posterior biological treatment  (Rodrigues  et al. , 2009 ; Martins  et al., 2010a ; Martins  et al.,  2010c;  
Oller  et al.,  2011 ). 
This work has as main purpose to develop a novel methodology able to minimize the impact 
over the activated sludge reac tors due to the harvesting period peak during winery wastewater 
treatment. This new process can be applied for different wineries, as an integrated and compact 
technology. This study evaluates the integration of coagulation, chemical oxidation and biologic al 
treatment for an application at the real scale. A first stage with iron based coagulants was applied. A 
certain amount of this iron will remain dissolved and can be directly used as catalyst in Fenton’s 
reaction. The main goal of this oxidation stage wa s to verify the possibility of enhancing 
biodegradability, thus endorsing a substantial more efficient and quick posterior biological treatment 
(Wang et al.,  2008 ; Padoley  et al., 2011 ; You et al. , 2011).  
In this context, the novelty of this research rela tes with the development of a compact 
treatment system able to be adapted to the flow and composition variations of winery wastewater 
along the year. Moreover, a coagulation step that will also produce the catalyst for the posterior 
Fenton’s peroxidation c onstitutes an important step in processes integration. This procedure would 
allow designing the biological tanks for the off season period and apply the chemical process as a 
pre-treatment during the harvesting period.  
IV.4.2  Materials and methods  
IV.4.2.1  Winery waste water characterization  
Winery Wastewater (WinW) was collected in March 2011 from a winery located near 
Sabrosa, Portugal. Its main characteristics are present in Table IV.4.1 . Briefly, the chemical and 
physical properties of the WinW were: pH 4.3; Chemical  Oxygen Demand (COD) 5180 mgO 2.L-1; 
Total Suspended Solids (TSS) 556 mg.L-1; Total  Nitrogen Content (TN) 55.8 (mg.L-1) and  Total 
Phosphorous Content (TP) 5.49 mg.L-1.

IV.4.2.2  Reagents  
All reagents (Hydrogen peroxide (49.5%), ferric sulfate, ferric chloride, sulfuric acid (30%) 
and sodium hydroxide) were industrial grade and used as received .  
IV.4.2.3  Analytical methods  
The liquid samples were analyzed regarding COD, TSS, BOD 5, TN and TP. All the 
parameters were measured in accordance with Standard Methods (Greenberg  et al. , 1985).  
COD determination was performed by the 5220D standard method using a COD 
thermoreactor (HAN NA HI 839800) and a HANNA HI 83224 photometer. The dissolved oxygen 
for BOD 5 analysis was measured using a HANNA HI 4421 measurer while pH was determined using 
a HANNA HI 4522 pH meter. Hydrogen peroxide concentration was controlled during and after the 
treatments using test strips. Along the experiments, ammonia (N -NH 4), nitrite (N -NO 2), nitrate (N -
NO 3), and phosphates (P -PO 4) were analyzed with the specific kits using a HANNA HI 83224  
photometer.   
Total Total Suspended Solids (TSS) were obtained by Stand ard Methods: “2540 D: Total 
Suspended Solids Dried at 103 - 105 °C” ( Greenberg et al. , 1985). Iron content on the liquid phase 
was measured by atomic absorption in a Perkin -Elmer 3300 apparatus.  Chloride was obtained by 
ionic chromatography (Waters) .  
All the referred measurements were determined in non -filtered samples. To check 
repeatability, some experiments were randomly run in duplicate and the samples were analyzed in 
triplicate to minimize the experimental error. The deviations between the performed  runs were 
always lower than 5% and 12% for COD and BOD 5 results , respectively . 
IV.4.2.4  Coagulation experiments  
Coagulation experiments were performed at ambient conditions using a jar test. Two iron 
based coagulants ( Fe2 (SO 4)3.5H 2O and FeCl 3.6H 2O) were tested in  doses varying within the range 
500 and 2000 ppm. The effect of pH (from 2 to 6) over COD and TSS removal was also evaluated.  
Each coagulant was added to 250 mL of effluent in the mentioned conditions. The experimental 
process consisted in three steps: fl ash mixing for one minute (120 rpm) followed by 30 min of slow 
stirring (20 rpm) in order to promote coagulation. Afterwards, two samples were taken. The first was 
used to analyze directly the resulting supernatant (after one hour of sedimentation). In the  second Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
136 one, sodium hydroxide was added until reaching a pH value of 10 so that iron precipitation could be 
promoted. The supernatant was analyzed after 1 h of sedimentation . 
IV.4.2.5  Fenton Oxidation  
Iron remaining in solution after the coagulation step was appli ed as catalyst in Fenton’s 
process. The oxidation was carried out in a jar test system. Briefly, 250 mL of wastewater were 
introduced in a glass reactor. The initial pH was the one coming from the coagulation stage. This 
parameter was left run freely durin g the experiments (between 2.4 and 3.2). The reaction (at room 
conditions) initiates when a specified amount of H 2O2 was added in the reactor. Along the treatment, 
samples were withdrawn for analysis. NaOH was introduced to promote the precipitation of iro n, 
removing a fraction of the organic matter  (Gulkaya  et al. , 2006) and quenching the remaining H 2O2 
(Martins  et al.,  2010 c).   
IV.4.2.6  Biological treatment  
Aerobic biological treatment was performed at laboratory scale in a Sequential Biological 
Reactor (SBR) wit h an operating volume of 150 mL. Agitation was magnetically promoted at a speed 
of 150 rpm. An air diffuser was used to maintain aerobic conditions. Temperature was kept around 
22 ± 2 °C while pH was maintained around pH 7.5 -8.5 by adding H 2SO 4 10% and NaO H 1 M.  
The biological process was divided into five distinct phases following a controlled time:  
filling (5 min), aeration -reaction (19 -20h), settling (3h), draw and idle (5 min). The reactor was 
operated with a solids retention time (SRT) of 10 days. The  SBR was inoculated with 150 mL of 
activated sludge (3000 -4000 mg.L-1 of Volatile Suspended Solids), from the aeration tank of a winery 
WWTP near Cartaxo (Portugal). For acclimation of the biomass, an HRT of 10 days was used with 
treated water resulting fr om the WWTP that was mixed with raw winery effluent at ratios of 1:10, 
2.5:10, 5:10 and 10:10.  
Analysis of COD of the influent and effluent of the biological reactor were carried out in a 
daily basis. Besides, iron content after the biological treatment w as also assessed. The activated 
sludge volume was determined. Moreover, the indicator of the sludge conditions was also performed 
through Madoni classification  (Madoni, 2003).   IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
137 IV.4.3  Results and discussion  
IV.4.3.1  Coagulation experiments  
The main purpose of this stage was to achieve an efficient TSS removal and an acceptable 
COD reduction. Moreover, the resulting conditions should favor the application of a posterior Fenton 
like reaction. Thus, the final pH should be in the range of 2.5 -3.5 (Mandal  et al., 2010 ; Karthik eyan 
et al . 2011). Most importantly, this work addressed the possibility of maintaining a final iron 
concentration after coagulation able to initiate Fenton’s reaction without the need of the addition of 
further catalyst.   
 
Figure  IV.4.1 - a) COD and b) T SS removal at different pH and FeCl 3.6H2O dosages  
Figure  IV.4.1 shows the effect of pH on COD (a) and TSS (b) removal when FeCl 3.5H 2O 
was used as coagulant. It is possible to observe that COD removal is more effective for a pH range 
between 5 and 6. Moreov er, the best depletion was achieved when 1500 ppm of this coagulant at pH 
6 was used. When pH rises from 3 to 6, COD removal efficiency increased from 29.5% to 42.5 %. 
For the lower tested pH (3), the coagulant dose increase improved COD depletion efficien cy from 
24 to 30.8%. However, for the raw effluent pH (4.3), as well as for pH 6, the coagulant dosage 
increase reduces COD abatement, probably due to the fact that pH is the key parameter controlling 
hydrolysis species.  These species promote positive or negative charges depending on the pH. 
Generally, these species are positively charged for pH lower than 6 and negatively charged for higher 
values  (Tatsi  et al.,  2003). The positively charged hydrolysis species can absorb on the colloidal 
particles surface  originating their destabilization. This mechanism is entitled as ‘charge 
neutralization’. The formed precipitate can physically agglomerate the colloidal particles in 
suspension  (Liang  et al.  2009).  
At pH 6, COD removal increases with the coagulant dose,  leading to a maximum COD 
abatement of 42.5% when 1500 ppm are applied; however, for further higher dosages COD removal

138 tends to decay possibly due to partial re -stabilization of colloids  (Sarika  et al., 2005; Aygun and 
Ylmaz, 2010).  
In what regards TSS r emoval, Figure  IV.4.1 b) shows that solids abatement increased with 
pH.  Significant differences are found for two pH ranges: values below or equal the effluent raw pH 
and another for higher pH values. For the lowest pH range, the best removal efficiency w as 
accomplished at raw pH when 500 ppm of coagulant were added (42.3%). The further increase on 
coagulant load led to a decay on the process efficiency. On the other hand, for higher pH’s, the 
removal efficiency is more expressive. This fact could be justi fied by the use of NaOH for pH 
correction. OH- promote the formation of insoluble compounds that precipitate leading to a more 
effective settling, improving the process effectiveness (Jiang and Graham , 1998, Peres  et al. , 2004). 
From the results attained u sing FeCl 3.5H 2O it is possible to conclude that the best TSS is obtained in 
the test with 500 ppm at pH 5 (59.7%) and the worst outcome was reached for the same pH but with 
2000 ppm (49.3%).   
 
Figure  IV.4.2 - a) COD and b) TSS removal at different pH and Fe2 (SO 4)3.5H 2O dosages  
Figure  IV.4.2 COD and TSS removal for several ferric sulfate doses and pH.  In what 
concerns COD removal ( Figure  IV.4.2 2 a)), best results (44.1%) are attained for an initial pH value 
of 6 using 1000 ppm of coagulant. For this pH, t he removal profile shows that the efficiency increases 
with the coagulant dose until 1000 ppm ; however, higher loads promote a decrease in the treatment 
effectiveness due to the above mentioned partial re -stabilization of the colloidal system.  The worst 
results were obtained for more acidic pH with only 24.8% of COD elimination for a reactant dose of 
1000 ppm .  
The TSS removal profiles , represented in Figure  IV.4.2 b) are identic to those attained for 
COD, showing that for this coagulant, the organic matte r abatement is dependent on the amount of 
solids removed. The highest efficiency was observed in the test performed with 500 ppm at raw pH

139 leading to up to 45.4% of COD abatement. The worst conditions for TSS elimination were 500 ppm 
and pH 6 (35.8%).   
Both coagulants show to be effective in the TSS and COD removal. However, the main goal 
of this investigation is to get a precursor working as coagulant, but also able to lower pH (that must 
be in the range 2.5 - 3.5) and ensure a final iron concentration al lowing a subsequent Fenton -like 
oxidation .  
 
Figure  IV.4.3 - pH variation for the differents experiments with the Fe 2(SO 4)3.5H 2O  a)  and FeCl 3.6H 2O b) 
dosages  
The pH change with the coagulant dosage is presented in Figure  IV.4.3. The treated 
wastewater p H value continuously decreased with the increasing dosage of coagulant. For ferric 
chloride the values ranged from 5 (500 ppm at an initial pH of 6) to 2 (1500 and 2000 ppm at an 
initial pH of 3). On the other hand, for ferric sulfate the values ranged fro m 5.1 (500 ppm at an initial 
pH of 6) to 2.3 (2000 ppm at an initial pH of 3). The decrease of pH values is justified by the acidic 
character of the tested coagulants promoted by the fact that the Fe3+ cations are Lewis acids  (Ntampou 
et al.,  2006).   
It should be though referred that the counter ions of the coagulants (sulfate and chloride) are 
still in solution after the coagulation process. As it is well known, chloride interferes in the COD 
measurement and it is recommended that it should not be used fo r concentrations above 2000 mg.L-
1 (Greenberg  et al. , 1985). Besides, chloride is a legislated parameter with a threshold that must be 
fulfilled so that an effluent can be discharged. Thus the residual chloride concentration on the 
coagulated water was fol lowed and it is presented in  Figure  IV.4.4  for the different pH values.

Figure  IV.4.4 - Chloride concentration for the different experiments with FeCl 3.6H 2O 
The results reported confirm that the chloride concentration in  solution was mainly 
dependent on the amount of coagulant added rather than on the initial pH. In fact, the deviations 
between the results determined for the same coagulant concentration for different initial pH values 
do not reach 10%. Due to the high Cl- concentration found and bearing in mind the possible formation 
of organochloride compounds with toxic features during oxidation, it was concluded that the best 
coagulant should be ferric sulfate.  
Another important consideration that must be taken for the  purpose of this work is the amount 
of iron in solution after coagulation. It must be a load able to promote Fenton’s peroxidation. Thus, 
for the different assays, the amount of iron in solution was determined . Figure  IV.4.5 presents the

(proportional to the added amount of coagulant).  In this case, the most favorable pH was the lowest 
one, maintaining almost 60% of the initial iron in solution. For pH values exceeding the raw effluent 
value (4.3), iron content is residual and tends for the same value, regardless the added quantity. 
Considering these findings, the more effective pH to maintain the iron present in solution was 3 .  
For the abovementioned pH, the remaining iron content as we ll the COD and TSS removal 
are presented in  Figure  IV.4.6.

Figure  IV.4.6 - COD, TSS and Iron content after iron sulfate coagulation at pH 3 for different coagulant doses  
Through this Figure , it is possible to observe th at for the described conditions, the most 
favorable coagulant concentration, 1500 ppm, attains an efficient removal of organic load (29.2%) 
and total suspended solids (40.7%), but at the same time, maintains a concentration of iron sufficient 
(920 ppm) to allow a subsequent Fenton -like oxidation . 
IV.4.3.2  Fenton -like Oxidation  
The dose of reactants required for Fenton’s process is an important factor to consider since 
it determines the economic feasibility of the treatment. As mentioned, a certain amount of iron 
remains in solution, resulting from the previous coagulation stage, which allows reducing the costs 
related with the catalyst.  The reaction time was varied in the range of 30 -720 min (0.5 -12 h). pH of 
the reaction mixture was maintained at the resulting valu e from the coagulation stage (pH 2.75). The 
initial value of hydrogen peroxide dosage was established based in the stoichiometric relation given 
by Lucas  et al. (2009b)   (1 g COD = 0.065 mol H 2O2). 10% of that amount (1.22 L.m-3) was set as 
starting point .  From the results attained with this preliminary test, it was concluded that the oxidation 
time should be 8 hours, since after that only a slight COD removal improvement of 6% was obtained .  Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
142 To analyze the effect of hydrogen peroxide dose, this parameter  was varied from 5 to 50% 
of the stoichiometric value using the same conditions (pH 2.75, 480 min of reaction and iron content 
in the order of 920 ppm). 
Figure  IV.4.7 a) and b) show the evolution of residual normalized COD and biodegradability, 
at differen t doses of hydrogen peroxide.

During the optimization studies, it was found that the COD remov al (Fig. 7a) firstly increases 
with H 2O2 concentration decreasing afterwards. When in excess, hydrogen peroxide will react with 
the formed hydroxyl radicals yielding the formation of less reactive radicals or innocuous species  
(Deng and Englehardt, 2006; P ignatello  et al. , 2006).  
Through th e observation of Figure  IV.4.7 a) it is possible to conclude that all tests performed  
led to significant COD abatement besides improving biodegradability.  The highest COD removal 
(42.1%) occurs for the experiment where 1 0 % of the stoichiometric oxidant dose was added. 
Besides, those conditions led to a biodegradability improvement of 60% (final BOD 5/COD of 0.40) .  
Figure  IV.4.7 b) presents a small interval of optimal dosages, between 10 and 15% of H 2O2 
stoichiometric val ue where the COD abatement and the biodegradability enhancement is observed 
with higher preponderance, showing that the  oxidant dosage control is essential .  
The major purpose of this integrated chemical scheme was to facilitate a subsequent 
biological tre atment.  So that the posterior biological system can properly operate, it is important to 
ensure that the required nutrients (COD, N and P) are in a proper ratio  (Strong, 2008).  Figure  IV.4.8 
exhibits the resultant COD, P and N for each oxidation test .

From the analysis Figure  IV.4.8 is possible to conclude that the Total Phosphorous and

abatement for the experiment where10% of the stoichiometric hydrogen peroxide value was used. 
With those conditions a final COD value of 2243mg.O2.L-1, as well as 6 and 1.2 mg.L-1 of N and P, 
respectively are reached.

It is possible to conclude that in the first hour, where the coagulation stage takes place, 30 % 
of the COD was removed and the biodegradability was improved  up to 0.28.  In the oxidation process, Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
144 the biodegradability increases until 0.4 due to the pollutants partial oxidation. COD removal was 
about 42.1 % showing that Fenton -like process is an effective methodology to promote organic load 
reduction besides improving biodegradability.  
 In what regards the iron content, after the coagu lation, 36% was eliminated from the system 
through the ferric sludge formed in this stage. Moreover, after 8 hours of oxidation only 59 ppm of 
Fe remains in the system. It should be referred that the biodegradability enhancement and the decay 
on the iron c ontent until a value that can be assimilated by the microorganisms (60 ppm) may promote 
an efficient subsequent biological oxidation .   
IV.4.3.3  Biological treatment  
As previously mentioned, the main goal of this research was to provide a suitable pre -treated 
waste water able to be easily further biologically oxidized. Figure  IV.4.10 exhibits the bio -reactor 
efficiency during 3 weeks of treatment .

The results show that COD reduction is significant. In fact, 52% of COD is abated for day 
one while a value above 73% is reached for the seventh day of treatment. This efficiency is 
maintained until the end of the experiment. The  treated water reaches a final COD value of around 
145 mg O 2. L-1. Besides, the biological system shows also an impressive ability to remove the iron 
from the aqueous media, achieving a final value of 1 mg.L-1. Thus, this methodology is able to reduce 
the iron content remaining after Fenton’s process. In fact, dissolved iron is a well -known drawback 
of this chemical oxidation system. The resulting water has conditions to be discharged in the hydric 
resources, during the grape harvest period . IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
145 Table IV.4.2 presents the microbiological species evolution and the sludge biotic index 
(SBI). The SBI, according with the Madoni classification, classifies the treatment efficiency as 
described in the label aside of the Figure IV.4.2 .

From the results it is possible to conclude that an adaptation time of 5 days was needed until 
the SBR starting to give a satisfactory response. At the 7th day, the process was stable with the 
microbiological system presenting a positive trend, improving the oxidation rate  until day 14. During 
this period, a high treatment efficiency and a well colonized activated sludge is observed leading to 
stable and optimal biological activity.  This conclusion is in agreement with what was presented in 
Figure  IV.4.10. These results sho w that the integrated chemical process under study is a suitable 
technology to be applied during the harvest period, improving the effluent quality and preserving the 
microorganism’s stability during this period . 
IV.4.4  Cost evaluation  
The operating costs are an  important factor on stakeholders decision for a new process. Thus, 
it is necessary to conduct an assessment of the operational costs before conceptualizing the physical 
structure of the wastewater treatment plant.  
The costs related with the construction, mechanical instrumentation and maintenance were 
excluded, mainly because they depend on the site, existing equipment, the characteristics of the 
wastewater and the volume to be treated  (Martins  et al.,  2010b). Therefore, with the aim of evaluating 
the reli ability of a possible industrial application of the developed treatment scheme for the studied Days  Madoni Classification

146 effluent, only the operating costs were assessed. For this purpose, the amount of reactants required 
for pH change, the amount of coagulant and the H 2O2 quantity  used were determined.   
The costs of the referred reactants are present in Table 0.1. The prices of these reactants 
were: H 2SO 4 (50%) = 0.141 €.L-1, Ferric Sulfate (49.5%) = 0.24 €. kg-1, hydrogen peroxide 50% 
=0.254 € .L−1 and NaOH =0.366 €.L-1. The costs associated with the sludge treatment and disposal 
were not considered .

For each cubic meter of raw effluent, it was necessary 0.34 L of H 2SO 4 to decrease the pH to 
3 and, at the end of the process, 0.45 L was added to reduce the pH to 8 before the biological 
treatment. The amount of coagulant required was 1.50 L and the most favorable hydrogen peroxide 
quantity was 1.22 L. Finally, it was necessary 0.32 L of NaOH to conclude the oxida tive reaction 
and consequent iron precipitation.  
  The operation costs for the proposed treatment scheme are present in Table 3. The costs are 
fixed per m3 (€.m-3) and per kilogram of removed COD (€.kg COD-1). As observed, the treatment of 
each cubic meter would costs 0.89 € corresponding to 0.27 € per kg of COD removed. A significant 
parcel of the total cost is due to Fe 2 (SO 4)3, corresponding to up to 40% of the total cost. However, it 
is important to remember that this precursor had two distinct roles, as coagulant and as catalyst in 
Fenton’s process. It is also impressive that the cost resultant from the sum of NaOH and H 2SO 4 
dosages is very similar to th e one related to the oxidant, reaching 26%.  
Although the present process brings higher costs when compared with the direct application 
of the traditional biological treatment, the required time for biological oxidation decreases as well. 
This will reduce the costs associated with aeration. So, the advanced oxidation process followed by 
a biological system can be an environmental and economical alternative for the treatment of this kind 
of agro industrial wastewater especially during the peak period of wine ry wastewater production . 
 IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
147 IV.4.5  Conclusions  
This paper emphasizes the performance of an integrated coagulation -Fenton -like system for 
the depuration of winery wastewater.  The study revealed that the proposed methodology is efficient 
to treat this effluent, att aining an interesting biodegradability enhancement.  The results obtained for 
the optimal conditions are depicted in Table IV.4.4.

The coagulation step leads to 25 % and 40.7 % of COD and TSS removal respectively. This 
stage leads to a final effluent wit h a pH and dissolved iron content able to promote a posterior 
Fenton’s peroxidation. The oxidation step leads to a COD reduction of 42%, and a BOD 5/COD 
improvement of 60%, with a final content of 59 ppm of iron. At the end of this pre -treatment scheme 
were  also removed 89% and 80% of Total Phosphorous and Nitrogen.  
The integrated oxidative process endorses a global COD removal of 56.6% and enhanced the 
wastewater biodegradability (BOD 5/COD = 0.4), showing that it could be efficiently used as prior 
treatmen t before a biological system.  The operating costs inherent to the reactants required for the 
overall process are 0.89€.m-3 which corresponds to 0.27 € per kg of COD abated.  
The biological system needs an adaptation time and at the end of the 7th day up to  74% of 
COD removal was achieved along with the reminiscent iron elimination.  
The described chemical processes when integrated with a posterior biological treatment 
reach the legal limits for the effluent disposal into the natural water courses during grap e harvesting. 
Thus, the SBR can be designed to the average flow charge of the off season leading to a smaller 
reactors .

151 IV.5   From a lab test to industrial application: scale -up of 
Fenton -process as real treatment to olive mill wastewater  
IV.5.1  Introduction  
In the last two decades great emphasis has been given to the problem  related with the disposal 
and treatment of olive mill wastewaters (OMW), namely at countries producers of olive oil.  
Currently, the most used methodology to treat OMW is the storage in lagoons, and posterior 
evaporation by natural convection (Ginos et al., 2006; Kallel et al., 2009a). However, this approach 
contains severe drawbacks as low efficiency and sludge -disposal problems since it can only 
concentrate the effluent and does not promote the organic matter degradation, leading to an 
environmental prob lem to the surrounding populations due to the smell and possible water 
contaminations (Jarboui et al., 2010). The main difficulties allied to the olive mill wastewater 
treatment  are  generally  associated with the seasonal operation,  high organic loading ,  and   presence  
of  organic  compounds  which  are  hard  to  biodegrade,  such  as  phenolic compounds and long 
chain fatty acids (Mert et al., 2010). For this reason, the biological processes are often times 
unsuccessful (Gonçalves et al., 2007). Howe ver, when combined with chemical or physical systems, 
the pollutants reduction can be extremely improved (Khoufi et al., 2006).  There  have  been  many  
works    in  literature  to  find  efficient  and  cost effective  treatment  alternatives  for  OMW  
treatment including coagulation/flocculation/precipitation (Ginos et al., 2006), chemical (Cañizares 
et al., 2007), aerobic and anaerobic biological treatment (Mert et al., 2010 ; Azabou et al., 2010), 
membrane separation (Akdemir and Ozers, 2006; Ochando -Pulido et al., 2013a) and their 
combinations (Andreozzi et al., 2008 ; Ochando -Pulido et al., 2013b).  In  particular,  new  trends  are 
focused  on  integrating   advanced  oxidation  processes  (AOPs), wh ich  may  be  able  to  remove 
recalcitrant  compound s  (Mar tins and Quinta -Ferreira, 2009) . Truth fully, in the last years, AOPs 
have  been  applied  to  industrial  wastewater  as a  polishing  step (Khoufi et al., 2006)  integrated 
with  conventional  chemical (Ginos et al., 2006) and/or  biological  proc esses (Bressan et al., 2004) 
(Zorpas and Costa, 2010) in  order  to  increase the overall  treatment  effectiveness.  
The advanced oxidation processes are arising as suitable choices competent to degrade the 
bio-refractory pollutants for agro industrial wa stewater (Kallel et al., 2009b; Hodaifa et al., 2013). 
In these systems the hydroxyl radicals formation is promoted, a very powerful oxidant that leads to 
effective oxidation. This is the case of the Fenton reagent, a process that is receiving great attent ion 
as a promising methodology for wastewater processing based on the oxidant power of hydrogen 
peroxide catalyzed by iron ions to enhance the formation of hydroxyl radicals, which promote chain 
reactions and consequently endorse an effective degradation o f pollutants (Martins et al., 2010). The Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
152 Fenton process (Zorpas and Costa, 2010; Lucas and Peres, 2009b) and Fenton -like process (Hodaifa 
et al., 2013; Nieto et al., 2011) were studied and described as effective treatment able to degrade the 
OMW refractory  pollutants, nonetheless with some restrictions in its application. Compared to other 
AOPs, Fenton’s oxidation presents several advantages, besides the H 2O2 be environmentally friendly 
because it may be decomposed into oxygen and water, the Fe2+ (catalyst)  exists in abundance, has 
lack of toxicity and it is easy to remove from water, what makes this process a suitable technology 
(Kallel et al., 2009b; Zorpas an d Costa, 2010 ).  
Additionally, a previous treatment could endorse a more effective oxidative treat ment. 
Several studies propose the integration of a pre - coagulation stage that enables the solids removal, 
some organic matter subtraction, but above all promotes a more consistent effluent without large 
variations of organic and inorganic loads, allowing an improved oxidation (Rizzo et al., 2008)  
(Papaphilippou et al., 2013). Other possibility is the integration with a biological treatment, normally 
a more economical option that  for itself would be inefficient, but could be favored by the 
biodegradability  enhancement promoted by the chemical reaction ( Lafi et al., 2009; Zorpas and 
Costa, 2010).  
The main objective of the present work was to investigate the depuration of an industrial 
wastewater from an olive oil production coming from a storage lagoon using  the Fenton technology. 
The aim was to attain a stream legally able to be discharged to the local sewage collector (COD  ≤ 
1250 mgO 2.L-1). Thus, lab tests were effectuated in a jar test apparatus and posteriorly were scaled 
up to a continuous industrial scale WWTP where the OMW treatment was performed. Whatever the 
treatment requirements, the economic factor is always superi mposed to the operational dimensioning 
for a future application, and the reagent’s required quantity is one of the most important factors to 
consider, as it could determine the economic feasibility of the process. In fact, the final decisions 
will take int o account the amount of reactants and the simplification of some operational procedures 
with the intention of obtaining a simple, robust, economic and viable treatment. A strong novelty of 
this work is the industrial application of the laboratory developed  methodology.

The wastewater was collected in Spain, at the province of Badajoz on the same storage 
lagoon where later the industrial effluent was treated. The effluent was characterized by  dark color, 
high amount of suspended solids, moderate COD, low/moderate BOD 5, Nitrogen (TN) and 
Phosphorous (TP) content, as well an acidic pH.

IV.5.2.2  Reagents  
All reagents were industrial grade provided from ADVENTECH suppliers and were used 
without any additional purification process as was the case of the hydrogen peroxide (49.5%), ferric 
sulfate, ferrous sulfate, sulfuric acid (30%) and sodium hydroxide.  
IV.5.2.3  Analytical methods  
All  analyses  were  performed  according  to  the  standard  methods for  the  examination  
of  water  and  wastewaters  (Greenberg et al., 1985).  
The Total Suspended S olids (TSS) were measured by Standard Methods: “2540 D: Total 
Suspended Solids Dried at 103 - 105 °C”. In  particular,  chemical  oxygen  demand  (COD),  was  
measured by the  closed reflux, colorimetric method,  using  an  HANNA HI 839800 thermoreactor 
and a HANNA HI 83224 photometer. pH (HANNA HI 4522) was  adjusted  adding  H 2SO 4 (30%)  
or 3 M  NaOH,  when  necessary. The dissolved oxygen for BOD 5 was measure using a HANNA HI 
4421 dissolved oxygen meter. Ammonia nitrogen (N -NH 4), nitrite nitrogen (N -NO 2), nitrate nitrogen 
(N-NO 3), and phosphates (P -PO 4) were analyzed with a HANNA HI 83224 photometer.  
All the referred measurements were determined in non -filtered samples. To check 
repeatability, some experiments were randomly run in duplicate (with the exc eption at the industrial 
scale) and the withdrawn samples were analyzed in triplicate to minimize the experimental error. The 
deviations between the performed runs were always lower than 7% and 15% for COD and BOD 5 
results, respectively.  Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:

154 IV.5.2.4  Experimental work development  
In this work, two distinct parts were performed; initially at lab scale, the coagulation study 
that accomplished the solids fraction removal in addition to the pH drop until a desirable value to 
Fenton oxidation was carried out. Wastewater samp les were introduced in a beaker and stirred and 
the Fe2+ dosage was added; the reaction started when a known volume of the H 2O2 was inserted. The 
oxidation terminated with NaOH addition until a pH of 10.  
In a second step the obtained results were scaled u p to the industrial wastewater treatment 
plant, also designed for this purpose and for the mentioned hereafter treatment scheme. In contrast 
with the laboratorial tests, this installation works continuously with a flow rate of approximately 1.5 
m3.h-1. 
IV.5.2.4.1  Coagulation experiments  
In this physical -chemical pre -treatment, the experiments were performed through a jar test 
apparatus and an iron based coagulant Fe2 (SO 4)3.5H 2O was used by applying several dosages, 
between 500 and 3000 ppm. The coagulant was dosed in to 250 mL of wastewater and the 
experimental process consisted in three steps, a first stage with a flash mixing for one minute (120 
rpm) followed by 20 min at 20 rpm in order to promote the agglomeration. Posteriorly, two samples 
were taken, being the fir st one the resultant supernatant and the second a sample in which sodium 
hydroxide was added until reaching a pH value of 11. One hour of sedimentation was promoted and 
the supernatants were analyzed at the end of sedimentation period by measuring COD and TSS.   
For the most favorable conditions, a 2 liters assay was performed, given that the main 
purpose, besides the COD removal, was also to maintain the pH unchanged in order to avoid the 
subsequent pH adjusting for the posterior oxidation thus eliminating  another procedural step.  
IV.5.2.4.2  Fenton Oxidation  
 All the experiments were performed at room temperature, without pH control and all the 
reactants were added in a single step.  
The oxidation process was accomplished in a jar test apparatus where each experiment  was 
prepared into a stirred glass reactor using 250 mL of wastewater. The pH value was provided by the 
coagulation stage, and its value runs freely during the experiments between 2.8 and 3.3 for all the 
performed experiments. After the addition of a certa in iron dose, the reaction starts when H 2O2 was 
added in the system.  Along the oxidative process, several samples were withdrawn during the IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
155 procedure time for subsequent analysis. Sodium hydroxide was added at the end of the previous 
established reaction time to promote the precipitation of iron hydroxides and subsequent iron removal 
in addition to the residual H 2O2 in solution extinguishment. The samples analyses were performed at 
least after 24 hours. The COD results of a first test with 48 hours oxidati on, revealed that for retention 
times higher than 24h, the organic content degradation improved only 8% until the end, hence 
limiting the oxidative operation for greater residence times, with respective diminution of treatment 
capacity.  
IV.5.2.4.3  Industrial applicat ion 
The industrial application was performed in CASAT SA, and the WWTP simplified scheme 
is exhibited in Figure  IV.5.1. The wastewater resulted from the 2012 campaign was stored in a pond, 
without any previous treatment. A detailed description of each stag e and respective units is also 
performed.    
The process was composed by four distinct stages, all of them dependent and conditioned by 
the upstream and downstream units, which were adjusted in order to accomplish their specific 
purpose, as describe below:  
 Coagulation: When the effluent was pumped from TH, the coagulating agent is added in 
line and goes to D1 where is subjected to rapid mixing and then is discharged and 
submitted to decantation.  
 Oxidation: The effluent derived from D1 is forced by action o f a pump to go to RT. 
During this discharge iron sulfate and hydrogen peroxide were added, and the mixture 
was promoted, being then discharged in RT where the reaction time was performed. 
When this tank was full, at the same time that enters water from D1,  the same volume 
was expelled to D2.  
 Neutralization/flocculation: When the water comes from RT, NaOH was added to 
correct the pH for a value of 10, cationic flocculant was injected and during the discharge 
to D2 the mixture was promoted.  
 Discharge: In D2 , and after the adequate settling, the sludge was removed by action of a 
mono -pump, the clean water exits through the upper crown, and the pH was corrected to 
7-9, in order to discharge to the collector  Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:

Figure  IV.5.1 - Simplified Wastewater Treatment Plan t Scheme  
In the following section the main results and the changes in the process will be described. 
While in the lagoon it was observed that the Chemical Oxygen Demand decrease over time, which 
might be explained by two facts that were promoted during the  stabilization in the lagoon: 
sedimentation of the organic matter on the bottom, and also the existence of microbiological action 
(Jarboui et al., 2010). The continuous treatment was carried out with an average flow of 1.5 m3.h-1, 
with an estimated treated  volume of 450 m3 of effluent.  
IV.5.2.4.4  Biological Treatment  
After the industrial application, samples were taken during the process. The resultant treated 
wastewater was submitted to Aerobic Biological Treatment performed at laboratory scale and 
executed in a Susp ended Biological Reactor (SBR) of 500 mL with 400 mL of aerobic sludge, 
equipped with stirring plat and stirred bar at speed rate of 150 rpm and aerated by air diffuser, 
promoting the biomass diffusion with the aim of providing the necessary oxygen concent ration to 
endorse aerobic conditions. The temperature was kept around 22 ± 2 °C and the internal pH was 
unchanged within pH 7.6 -8.8 depending on the added sample.  
The treatment was composed by five distinct sequential phases:  filling (5 min), aeration -
reaction (19 -20h), settling (3h), withdraw and idle (5 min). The reactor was operated with a solids 
retention time (SRT) of 10 days, and the SBR was inoculated with 150 mL of biological sludge 
(1500 -2000) mg.L-1 of Volatile Suspended Solids), from the aeratio n tank of a winery WWTP. The 
tests were executed without any sludge adaptation and regular COD analyses were carried out.  
  
 IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
157 IV.5.3  Results and discussion  
IV.5.3.1   Laboratorial experiments  
IV.5.3.1.1  Coagulation experiments  
In  the coagulation  processes,  various  inorganic  mate rials such  as  iron,  magnesium  and  
aluminum  can be applied and their effect could be potentiated  by the use of some flocculants. 
However, the main aim of this stage, was to attain an effective COD removal and TSS reduction, 
besides providing the oper ational conditions that could favor a posterior Fenton oxidation, 
specifically the pH drop into the desirable range (3 -4). For this stated aim the use of flocculants with 
pH at the neutral region (Ntampou et al., 2006) should be inefficient as also would b ecome expensive 
an extra acidification stage.  
Due to previous tests effectuated on the WWTP, iron sulfate showed to be the more effective 
coagulant on the case of a winery effluent treatment for the pre -oxidation stage. However, in order 
to take fully adva ntage of the existent WWTP equipment without any kind of investment in the olive 
mill wastewater now under study, it would be impossible to make pH adjustment prior to this stage, 
so the tests were conducted at raw effluent pH.  
Initially, in order to enab le substantial solids removal and to provide most favorable water 
conditions for the subsequent oxidation, the study of the coagulation process has been performed. As 
result, five trials between 500 and 3000 ppm ferric sulfate were assessed, between the mi nimum and 
the maximum reactant amount considered acceptable for industrial application in view of the inherent 
cost. The main result s are presented in Figure  IV.5.2 .

Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
158 Figure  IV.5.2 represents the obtained COD and pH values correlated to the ferric coagulant 
added dose. There is a clear trend towards the increase in coagulant concentration with consequent 
COD reduct ion and more favorable lower pH  values . Nonetheless, this could lead to a decrease to 
undesirable values lower than 2. In fact, the aim is to directly apply a Fenton’s oxidation to the 
coagulated effluent, but pH < 2 leads to a reduction of the reaction extent (Lucas and Peres, 2009b).  
Taking  into account the abovementioned factors, the economic, operational and reactive 
constraints, the best selected conditions were 3000 ppm of coagulant that obtains COD decreased to 
3980 mgO 2.L-1 that corresponds to 38% of removal, with 40% of TSS depletion in addition to the pH 
drop until 3.4, a favorable value to the oxidation stage. These data indicate that this step efficiency 
increases with growing coagulant dose, especially for the higher concentrations were the difference 
is very significant (25% vs 40 % for 2500 and 3000 ppm respectively), presenting a relation between 
TSS and COD as can be observed by the removal profile.  
Such results could be justified by two reasons:  in a first step a part of the coagulant added 
acidifies the medium (Ntampou et al. , 2006), and the pH of the effluent approached to the most 
favorable pH for coagulation; and then the remaining concentration form various hydrolysis products 
that integrate Fe(OH) 3, originating compounds that have high cationic charge which provides the 
neutralization of the electrostatic charges existent on colloidal material and also to connect to 
negatively charged particles promoting the formation of a fraction of sludge, (Tatsi et al., 2003) that 
will settle.  
IV.5.3.1.2  Fenton Oxidation  
 The economic factor of a process is always superimposed to the operational dimensioning 
for future application, and the required Fenton’s reagent dose is an important factor to consider as it 
could determine the economic feasibility of the technology.   
Contrary to what is norma lly executed, the doses of reagents are not pre -determined 
according to the COD complete degradation, but by taking into consideration the minimum amount 
of reagents liable to achieve the desired removal to the imposed discharge limit. For this reason an 
array of tests with a fixed concentration of catalyst (500, 1000 and 1500 ppm) was carried out, each 
with varying [oxidant/catalyst] in weight/weight, being this ratio very important in the effectiveness 
of the Fenton degradation ( Lucas and Peres, 2009b; Hodaifa et al., 2013).  
The contact time of Fenton’s reagent and wastewater in the reaction mixture was 1320 min 
(24 h) and intermediary samples were taken; the initial pH was the resulting value provided from the 
coagulation stage (pH 3.4).  IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Figure  IV.5.3 - COD, removal efficiency and reactants doses used for the oxid ation experiments  
It is possible to observe that the increase in the iron load and hydrogen peroxide dose (showed 
in ppm in the right side of the Figure  IV.5.3) led to better COD removal.  
Initially 3 tests (1 -3) were performed, with the mentioned different  ratios (w/w) 5, 10 and 
15. The three tests had the same iron content and different oxidant concentrations. By the efficiency 
analysis it is possible to conclude that the best result arises for intermediate ratio, having a significant 
gain compared with th e first (22 vs 35 %). However, for higher oxidant concentration there was a 
marked decrease in the efficiency (26%), promoted by the scavenging effect due to the oxidant 
excess. When the oxidant concentration is quite large there are parallel reactions whi ch lead to the 
consumption of hydrogen peroxide by reacting with the formed radicals, thereby decreasing both 
amount of radicals as well as the peroxide concentration (Deng and Englehardt, 2006 ; Pignatello et 
al., 2006). For this reason, the ratio 15 was d isregarded, appearing in the three further experiments 
the ratio [ H2O2: ferrous  sulfate] equal to 5, 7.5 and 10, for the tests with 1000 and 1500 ppm of 
catalyst.  
The tests sets 4 -6 and 7 -9, reveal that for the same iron dose, the increase on the hydrogen  
peroxide dose permits a better COD degradation with a huge gain on the process efficiency. As these 
tests were performed with the purpose of an industrial application, the trials were carried out aiming 
to achieve a COD value below 1250, which corresponds  to the maximum allowable legal value for 
discharge in the municipal sewage.  Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
160 This work involves optimization of the smallest possible amount of the reagents in order to 
make the process economically acceptable. In this case it was needed 1500 ppm of iron sulfate and 
15000 ppm of H 2O2, a ratio of 10, in order to attain best efficiency of 75% for the COD removal that 
corresponded a final COD value of 995 mgO 2.L-1. 
IV.5.3.2  Industrial Scale UP  
The wastewater was stored in a lagoon during 4 months to stabilize given b y some biological 
activity but also for the solids settling, instigating a pre -treated wastewater more limpid, with a small 
BOD 5, and more homogeneous mixture for the posterior treatment.  
IV.5.3.2.1  Coagulation   
This stage was the most difficult to control because i ts efficiency depends greatly on the 
effluent constitution. Since the effluent comes from a pond, there is a range of concentration profiles 
(COD and solids) over the time of treatment, requiring consequently the coagulant dose variation. 
During this perio d, efficiency and accuracy of the added amount was carried through the obtained 
pH value by increasing the concentration if the pH went up and lowering the concentration if the pH 
falls too much, in order to keep it between 3.2 -3.8.

Figure  IV.5.4 shows this stage efficiency in the removal of the chemical oxygen demand, as 
function of the days of treatment. It is observed that the effic iency increases over time, also promoted 
by the lowering in the chemical oxygen demand of the inlet wastewater.  IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
161 Initially, until the 3rd day, 3000 ppm of coagulant were added. However, the solid amount 
formed after coagulation was high and the pH (2.8) was  too low, whereby to the 3rd day the dose 
was reduced to 2500 ppm by keeping afterwards always constant throughout the treatment, lowering 
the pH to a value of 3.4 ± 0.2. The same happens on the 14th day, and it was necessary to reduce the 
coagulant concen tration to 1500 ppm to attain the described conditions with an effective increment 
on the process efficiency in the next day.  
From this analysis one can conclude that initially there was coagulant in excess, which 
promoted a re -stabilization of the colloi dal load, which in practice causes a dispersion rather than 
agglomeration and sedimentation resulting solid colloidal particles promoting a decreased efficiency 
(Sarika et al., 2005). Therefore, diminishing the coagulant dose immediately had a positive eff ect 
with an increase of over 200% on the system efficiency, where over 40% of the organic matter was 
eliminated. The observed results allow to conclude that this stage in the way it was conducted, 
promotes the preparation of the effluent for the further ox idative process besides being responsible 
for a significant reduction of COD, thus confirming to be an indispensable step of the overall 
purifying process.  
The added coagulant amount of this incomplete coagulation will provide dissolved iron in 
solution t hat will participate later in oxidation (Nieto et al., 2011) (Fenton -like) promoting greater 
efficiency in the Fenton’s process with especial advantage on the automatic adjustment of the pH to 
a favorable oxidative process value.  
IV.5.3.2.2  Oxidation Treatment  
As ex pected, there is a certain concentration of iron ( Fe (III)) in solution triggered by the 
coagulation stage. However, given the conditions of the implemented process, it was impossible to 
determine these quantities, as there were variations caused by the co agulant dosing pump and 
variations of the effluent flowrate, among others. Besides the remaining iron in solution, iron (II) 
was added in a solution at 7.5% (w/w) as well the hydrogen peroxide dosage that was pre -established. 
The organic load from day 1 wa s associated to the content of the Homogenization Tank (TH), and 
for this reason its value was slightly higher than the one that was observed for the remaining days.  
Figure IV.5.5 shows the COD after coagulation (inlet) and after the oxidative reaction 
(outlet), the dosage of Fenton's reagent, and the efficiency removal of the oxidation process.

Figure  IV.5.5 - Inlet and Outlet COD, removal efficiency and reactants doses used for the oxidation experiment  
Alone for itself, at the end of the perform ed depuration treatment period, the wastewater had 
COD very close to 1500 mgO 2.L -1 due to the partial degradation promoted in the storage lagoon 
(Khoufi et al., 2008; Jarboui et al., 2010). For this motive it was necessary to adjust the amounts of 
reagent s to avoid the appearance of competing parallel reactions which would reduce the oxidation 
efficiency (Kallel et al., 2009b). Whereas the proposed target would maintain a COD below 1250 
mgO 2.L-1, being the treated water at the end of coagulation stage with  such lower organic load that 
was necessary ( Figure  IV.5.5 ), the reagents dosages at the oxidation step were decreased on the 13th 
day of operation in order to optimize the overall efficiency for the stipulated output value and thus 
save on chemicals, maki ng this process economically more favorable.  
As can be seen, the outlet COD on the 5th day was insufficient for discharge. For that it was 
needed to increase the reagents dosages (H 2O2 and iron) to promote a stronger oxidation. The result 
of this action w as observed immediately on the following day; however, it should be noted that the 
wastewater volume to be treated is much smaller than the volume of the tank (continuous treatment) 
where the reaction was occurring (RT), and therefore there was a mixture e ffect of the different 
treatment days, taking a longer time to reach the efficiency value and consequent final COD value 
that was expected on the oxidation stage.  
On the 7th day, this process reached the desired COD (970 mgO 2.L-1), being kept the dose of 
reagents identical until the 13th day with a significant increase in the process efficiency. In this day 
and considering that the resulting oxidation COD was 430 mgO 2.L-1, it was decided to lower the 
H2O2 and iron amounts, that in turn slightly decreased e fficiency removal in the next few days but 
increased it afterwards considerably up to the maximum value measured over the entire period. 
Indeed, the effluent organic load considerably decreased, thus justifying efficiency increase towards 
100% and for this  motive the previous dose could be to have an adverse impact due to competing

163 side reactions taking in the oxidation reaction promoted by excess of reagents, that could be iron,

2012) efficiency, being necessary a rigorous control and assessment of the treatment conditions 
during the treatment time (Guieyss and Norvill, 2014). At the end of the treatment the oxidized water 
had a COD of 65 mgO 2.L-1. The samples taken from the reaction tank (oxidation process), were 
completely translucent with the respective settled iron sludge at the vessel bottom.    
IV.5.3.2.3  Neutralization  / flocculation  
The last step was the wastewater neutralization and the catalyst precipitation (iron in 
solution), which also fosters a coagulation of some of the resulting colloids from the purifying 
process (Kallel et al., 2009a). To facilitate sedimentation, flocculant was added with the purpose of 
increasing the flock size, yielding a more clean water.  
Figure IV.5.6 the resultant output samples taken from the collector from 30 to 30 minutes so 
as to verify the achieved improvement with cationic flocculant addition.  
 
 
Figure  IV.5.6 - D2 samples photos to assess the process efficiency before (left) and after  flocculant addition 
(right).  
According to Figure  IV.5.6, it could be observed that the flocculant addition brought an 
improvement in the process. Being a continuous process, the iron oxides did not have time to settle 
properly and were subsequently entrai ned by the wastewater flow coming out of the system, being 
maintained in suspension over time. After the flocculant addition it was possible to visualize a cleaner 
supernatant, that is an indicator of less iron flocks, which as shown in from left to right,  leads to a 
significant decrease in coloration of the discharged treated water with consequent lower Chemical 
Oxygen Demand.

Figure  IV.5.7 - COD profiles for the different wastewater streams of the Industrial Plant  
From these results it can be observed that the COD of the inlet wastewater shows a high 
reduction of the organic load over time to less than half from the start to the end of the tests. This 
feed stream variation shows that the storage pond enables the organic content reduction, quite 
possibly  due to the sedimentation of pollutants, which led to a raw wastewater with different 
concentrations in suspended solids, but also due to the microbiological action which manages to 
remove some biodegradable organic material (Jarboui et al., 2010).  
Over t he coagulation process there was the need to change from 3000 to 1500 ppm on ferric 
coagulant addition, which reduces considerably the pH to values that misfits the oxidation. The 
treatment with coagulation was a qualitative leap when reducing the dosage o f coagulant, 
demonstrating the need for continuous monitoring and correction of the reactants dosage, because 
when in excess, may cause undesirable adverse effects disabling an aggregation of pollutants and 
therefore a smaller removal efficiency. By the sl ope of the different curves it is possible to infer if 
the efficiency of each step is maintained throughout the process. In order to reduce the overall costs, 
the chemicals dosages in the oxidation stage were also optimized decreasing the amount of iron an d 
peroxide to 35% and maintaining the final COD close to 300 mgO 2.L-1. Presenting the same trend, IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
165 the Fenton process also enables the COD removal, reaching COD values of 65 mgO 2.L-1, proving to 
be very effective in the degradation of dissolved pollutants r esulting from the production of olive oil.  
In the overall process, the evolution of the efficiency of each stage of treatment was truly 
significant. The coagulation was able to remove 30% of COD in the first day and 50% in the last 
one, while the Fenton´s oxidation ranged from 40 until a remarkable 90% in the last day, also 
depending on the clotting and operating equipment, thus subject to slight variations. The discharged 
water started out with 1200 mgO 2.L-1 on day 1, because the start -up phase of the syst em is always 
more difficult and there is an amount of effluent that is only partially treated; however, with 
advancing time it stabilized very close to the 300 mgO 2.L-1  reaching in the last day of operation 
nearly 200 mgO 2.L-1. 
Figure  IV.5.8 shows the Ch emical Oxygen Demand in the various treatment steps, the overall 
efficiency of each stage and also the BOD 5/COD ratio (biodegradability) that enables to infer the 
possibility of the treated water being subjected to posterior biological treatment.

Biodegradability before and after the treatment  
Since this is a continuous process, one cannot say that the achieved final result is the sum of 
the effectiveness o f each stage. This is because the volume of each tank corresponds on average at 2 
days of flow operation, having the all facility from D1 to D2 the possibility to store a volume of 
about 6 days of treatment. With this, the mixture of wastewater with differ ent removal efficiencies 
and organic loads, promotes a treated water with different COD values. However, even after some 
decreases in the partial efficiencies, that obliged as reported the modification in the reagents doses, 
the overall efficiency is alway s increasing reaching at the last day of treatment a remarkable 90% of 
COD removal.

166 As regards the possibility to apply a biological treatment, it can be noted that the raw effluent 
lacked any likelihood of success. As already mentioned, the chemical oxyge n demand was waning 
throughout time, demonstrating that there was biological treatment at the storage lagoon, promoted 
through the action of microorganisms that consume a large part of the biodegradable fraction (the 
higher obtained value of the BOD 5/COD w as 0.065), with a substantial amount of non -biodegradable 
organic matter. It is in this context that is worthy to emphasize the usefulness and effectiveness of 
the applied integrated process, that besides enabling organic material mineralization towards a final 
low COD value (200 mgO 2.L-1), ensures that 40% of this value is biodegradable (BOD 5/COD = 0.4).  
Figure  IV.5.9 shows samples resulting from the different stages described before, within the 
respective sequence treatments where the visual results on ea ch of them reflect the system efficacy, 
in particular on the 19th day of operation.  
 
Figure  IV.5.9 - Samples of all existent streams in the 19th day 
As can be easily perceived, the outlet water had a higher organic loading than the water 
provided from the  oxidation stage, nonetheless well below the target value, demonstrating high 
overall process efficiency, with a clear final water complying with the legislation for discharge in 
municipal collector.  
IV.5.3.2.5  Biological treatment  
Normally, olive oil manufacturing f acilities are usually small plants with a seasonal 
wastewater stream, and the Fenton process would be sufficient to manage efficiently with the 
produced effluents. However, this kind of system significantly increases the cost of treatment, so that 
it shoul d be integrated with a low cost biological treatment, also demanding low intervention, or even 
to achieve a level of clearance able to provide water amenable to reuse, or depending of the specific 
requests, to be able to be discharged into the surrounding hydrologic resources.  The efficiency of 
 
  
  
  IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
167 the Fenton process as a pre -treatment step of wastewater was proved, increasing the biodegradability 
until a value that enables the biological treatment, with a BOD 5/COD=0.35 -0.4.  
To assess the availability of the possible integration, the treated OMW wastewater withdrawn 
from the final collector was fed into the SBR for a tertiary treatment. Figure  IV.5.10 shows the COD 
variation in the SBR effluent and removal efficiency.

There were some fluctuations in the effluent COD and respective efficiency, which can be 
divided into 3 parts: until day 27, an adaption time is observed showing a n efficiency in the range of 
60 and 76%, allowing to get a treated water with COD ranged between 160 and 210 mgO 2.l-1; from 
this day until day 60 where the system was fully adapted with an efficiency almost constant (80 -
85%), a COD in the order of 100 -140 mgO 2. L-1 was achieved, enabling  the discharges into water 
courses according to the Portuguese law; finally,  from de 60th day until the end of the experiment, a 
high COD removal of 95±2% and a resultant water with COD’s below 40 mgO 2.L-1, ensure its re -
use in the industrial facilities.  The stated results confirmed that the Fenton oxidation is one of the 
most effective treatments, being considered as a viable pre -treatment for the destruction of hardly 
biodegradable compounds which inhibit the use of biological processes (Guieysse and Norvill, 
2014) .

168 Cost evaluation  
IV.5.4.1  Laboratorial   
The major restrictions to exchange or to implement a new process are the operating costs, 
which have to be assessed before the scale up design to present the treatment system  to the future 
user/consumer. As in this case the installation is already in place, it will only be necessary to ensure 
the feasibility of the proposed method with the existing resources and equipment, solely with the 
exchange of materials and reagents wit hout any investment costs.  
For this purpose the coagulant dose, the iron sulfate amount, the H 2O2 quantity and the 
requested NaOH to finish the oxidative reaction as well as the sulfuric acid to the pH change before 
discharge were determined.  
For each lit er of wastewater, it was necessary 3 mL of coagulant to enable the solids removal 
and standardize the wastewater as well as promoting the decrease of the pH to 3.4. As discussed 
before the required catalyst concentration was 1.5 g and the most favorable hy drogen peroxide was 
15 mL. Finally, 1.1 L of NaOH was needed to terminate the reaction and 0.45 L of H 2SO 4 to reduce 
the pH to 8 to provide an appropriated wastewater to be discharged or to be conducted for biological 
treatment.  
IV.5.4.2  Industrial  
The operation c osts for the proposed treatment scheme are reported in Table IV.5. 2. The 
present values are representative from all used chemicals to treat 450 cubic meters of effluent, being 
the displayed prices correspondent to average values obtained throughout the tr eatment period. The 
costs are fixed per m3 (€.m -3) and per kilogram of removed COD (€.kg CODremoved -1) and 
represent the average value obtained with the consumed reagents (during the treatment) referent to 
the total volume treated coming from the pond. The  associated costs with the sludge treatment and 
disposal were not the different scales considered in the values of Table IV.5.2 .

169 As it possible to observe for the presented tr eatment, each cubic meter of effluent costs 2.17 
€ getting 1.09 € for each kg of COD removed. The hydrogen peroxide has a significant relevance to 
the total cost with more than 50% of the total reactants charge.   
Comparing the two scales, laboratorial and  industrial, besides the price being so different, 
the cost for each cubic meter could be justified by the quantity of organic load arriving to the system 
that diminishes over time, what in turn, has succeeded in decreasing the quantity of coagulant and 
reagents, thus contributing to the operating costs reduction. Moreover, the treatment cost to remove 
one kg of COD is much similar, proving that the execution at laboratory level allows for a 
rapprochement of the actual operating costs for the proposed treat ment, since the effluent derives 
from the same place as well as the same technology and reagents are used.   
In this case it is possible to conclude that the advanced oxidation process can be an 
environmental and economic interesting alternative for the tr eatment of this kind of agro industrial 
wastewaters and enables the application of subsequent biological systems in order to further reduce 
the organic charge, thus allowing a posterior discharge into the hydrological resources.  
IV.5.4  Conclusions  
This work show s that a simplified process combining the Fenton oxidation coupled to a 
previous coagulation stage is able to depurate the OMW. Moreover it also improves the wastewater 
biodegradability enabling the availability of posterior application of an aerobic biolo gical treatment. 
Thus a wastewater containing a large amount of pollutants and phenolic acids that cannot be easily 
treated by conventional physicochemical and biological processes is transformed into water able to 
be reused or discharged into the natural waterways without any damage to the surrounding resources.  
The laboratorial and industrial scale has significant differences, particularly on the 
requirement reagents doses to achieve a specific goal, as a certain COD value.  
At the laboratorial scale, the  coagulation stage achieves COD reductions of 38% and 40% of 
TSS, where the pH was changed by the acidic character of the coagulant until a value (3.4) that 
enables the Fenton oxidation, which can lead to a COD reduction of 75%. With this two -step 
treatmen t, the overall COD removal attains 85% and allows the wastewater discharge into a 
municipal collector. The operating cost inherent to the process are 7.87 €.m-3 having a particular cost 
of 1.44€ per kg of removed COD, through the removal of 5.4 kg of COD p er m3 of wastewater.  
In a distinct manner, it was observed that the organic load of the effluent shows a discrepancy 
over the treatment time with decreasing trend, where the last cubic meters have a COD content very Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
170 near to a value that would allow the dir ect discharge. This reveals that there is a clearance in the pond 
creating a decreasing COD profile observed during the treatment time, attaining a certain value where 
the coagulation stage is sufficient to attain an efficiency removal that could also allo w the direct 
discharge.  
The average efficiency on the WWTP for the different stages were: 43% on the coagulation 
and 62% on the oxidation stage, where the reactants doses were diminished because the re -
stabilization effect promoted by the excess of coagul ant and the scavenger effect enhanced by the 
excess of both reactants in the oxidation stage due to the fact that the solids and organic load decrease 
over depuration time. This treatment increases the wastewater biodegradability from 0.03 to 0.37 
enabling  the posterior application of biological treatment if necessary discharge into the water 
courses. The treatment has a real average cost of 1.09€ per kg of removed COD, through the removal 
of 1.99 kg of COD per m3 of wastewater, with an average cost of 2.17 € for each treated cubic meter.  
The result of the integration of the industrial treated wastewater with biological treatment 
performed at laboratorial scale shows that the microorganisms need an adaptation time, reaching an 
average efficiency of 68% until the day 23. However, at the end of the 60th day, the biomass was 
totally adapted, presenting a high efficiency treatment, supporting 86% of COD removal increasing 
from this day on until the end with a final a remarkable degradation of 95%.

173 IV.6  Ozonation and Perozona tion on the Biodegradability 
Improvement of a Landfill Leachate  
IV.6.1  Introduction  
The population growth joined with the urban development leads to extremely high domestic 
solid wastes production entailing suitable management technologies to protect both environ ment and 
human health. The landfilling method is one of the most common procedures for the ultimate disposal 
of these pollutants (Li et al., 2009) , minimizing the ecological impact by allowing the waste 
decomposition under controlled conditions, besides pr esenting economic advantages (Renou et al., 
2008) . The main issue regarding such techniques is related with the formation of large amounts of 
an aqueous effluent (known as leachate) due to the water content of the wastes, the rainwater that 
percolates thro ugh the waste bed and the aqueous remains produced during the pollutants biological 
oxidation (Tizaoui et al., 2007) . 
 The landfill leachates present complex composition, encompassing high organic loads as 
well as inorganic substances and heavy metals (Gotvajn et al., 2009) , depending, among other 
factors, of the landfill age (Goi et al., 2009) . This wastewater constitutes, thus, a potential threat for 
the quality of groundwater and its management requires special attention. It is well known that the 
leacha te characteristics change over time, and the treatment of these streams in conventional 
depuration plants is hardly accomplished due to the awkward features as the high content of 
pollutants and low biodegradability (Tizaoui et al., 2007) . Nevertheless, th e leachate handling must 
meet the quality level established for the final discharge into surroundings.  
For this reason, aiming to fulfil current environmental legislation, a treatment system must 
be developed, which has also to be robust enough to accompl ish sharp variations on the inlet effluent 
composition Li et al., 2009) .  Conventionally, landfill leachate is treated by biological processes; 
however, the implementation of bio -systems may be inadequate due to the effluents’ toxic 
characteristic and low BOD/COD ratio generally resulting in low efficacies (De Morais and Zamora, 
2005; Goi et al., 2009) . Since these traditional technologies are not effective for the removal of 
refractory compounds and the physico -chemical processes are non -destructive,  advan ced oxidation 
processes (AOPs) arise as alternative methodologies (Wu et al., 2004) . 
Chemical oxidation by advanced processes has as purpose to reach complete mineralization 
(into water and carbon dioxide) (Alvarez et al., 2000) , or, when economically more  advantageous, 
enhance the biodegradability of biorecalcitrant organic pollutants up to a value that will allow a 
posterior biological treatment (Martins et al., 2010; Cortez et al., 2010) .  Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
174  AOP s encompass ozonation which  is a treatment based on the high  oxidant power of ozone, 
that can be used to decompose large organic molecules into smaller and less complex ones occurring 
at normal pressure and temperature being, hence, industrially interesting (Chaturapruek  et al., 2005; 
Cortez et al., 2010) . This pro cess can be enhanced by promoting the formation of highly reactive 
agents, such hydroxyl radical (H O•), from ozone decomposition. The use of ozone at alkaline 
conditions (O 3/OH-) or in combination with strong oxidants such as H 2O2 (O3/H2O2) favours the 
production of these species (Gunten, 2003; Chandrasekara et al., 2013) that have an oxidation 
potential higher than the one attributed to molecular ozone. These processes can be, thus, attractive 
to treat complex streams such as leachate (Tizaoui et al., 2007 ). The chain radical reactions are non -
selective organic compounds until total mineralization. Contrarily, ozone molecule only undertakes 
specific reactions with other molecules encompassing high electronic density sites leading to low 
molecular weight by -products generally no further reactive. Therefore, ozonation is usually more 
efficient when the conditions support HO• production ( Kasprzyk -Hordern et al., 2003; Pera -Titus et 
al., 2004) . Nevertheless, if reactions are incomplete, the AOPs can also promote  the formation of 
refractory and more toxic by -products than the original pollutants. The economic factor is another 
restriction due to the high operational costs when high strength wastewaters are involved. A 
significant economic drawback derives from rea ctants consumption (e.g. H 2O2) and the electrical 
power required to produce ozone in situ. The major factor that can affect ozonation efficiency in the 
oxidation of refractory contaminants is the presence of carbonate and hydrogencarbonate ions in 
wastewat ers composition which can compete with the substrate for HO• radicals. Besides, the excess 
of H 2O2 on the Perozonation experiments, may also present a scavenging effect on the generated 
radical hydroxyls, reducing thus the process efficiency (Chandrasekara  et al., 2013) . 
In this context, the use of ozone has been studied for the oxidation of various effluents, with 
promising results in the degradation of landfill leachates (Wu et al., 2004; Chaturapruek et al., 2005; 
Ntampou et al., 2006; Tizaoui et al., 2007; Goi et al., 2009)  involving considerable depletions of 
chemical oxygen demand and colour, with also the advantage of biodegradability increase.  
Within this context, the main goal of this work was to obtain a suitable technology to 
depurate a landfill leachate aiming to enhance its biodegradability meeting the legal limits for the 
discharge of this liquid effluent to the sewage to be further treated in a municipal wastewater 
treatment plant generally based on activated sludge, providing reliable results  that can increase the 
industrial application of AOPs through the integration with a biological oxidative system. The data 
gathered here led to the design and building of an industrial installation based on AOPs to deal with 
this specific effluent with the  intention of  an immediate  industrial application . Aiming to give answer 
to a real environmental problem, experiments were conducted to compare the efficacy using ozone -
based advanced oxidation processes involving O 3 and O 3/H2O2. IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
175 IV.6.2  Materials and methods  
IV.6.2.1  Landfill Leachate Characteristics  
The leachate samples were collected from a municipal landfill in the centre region of Spain . 
The raw stream is pre -treated in situ by reverse osmosis, resulting in two types of effluents, the 
concentrate and the permeate. T he concentrated course is useless and has to be discharged or so 
prepared and subsequently treated (Renou et al., 2008) , while the last one still does not accomplish 
the characteristics permitting their discharge to the sewage due to the high organic conte nt 
represented as chemical oxygen demand, COD, so that this will be the effluent under study. The 
physicochemical characteristics of the permeate leachate were then analysed and listed in Table 
IV.6.1 . It should be noticed that as previously referred the l ow biodegradability detected inhibits the 
direct application of biological methodologies .

IV.6.2.2  Experimental set -up 
All the experiments were evaluated bearing in mind operational cost restrictions ensuring 
that all procedures can be perf ormed without high investments. Probably higher oxidant (O 3 or H 2O2) 
doses would lead to more significant depletions. Nevertheless, that would increase the operating 
costs of the global treatment making it not possible to commercialize.  
The ozonation exper iments were held in a stirred reactor operating in a semi -continuous 
mode. The liquid was charged at the beginning of the experiment and ozone was continuously 
introduced trough two porous diffusers placed in the liquid bulk. Ozone was generated from a pur e 
oxygen stream (500 mL.min-1) in an ozone generator BMT 804N (BMT, Berlin, Germany)  and the 
gas ozone concentration was measured using a BMT963 vent ozone analyzer (BMT, Berlin, 
Germany)  (Martins and Quinta -Ferreira, 2009).  
The oxidation experiments proc eeded as follows: 500 mL of the effluent were added to the 
reactor, brought to the desired temperature and the experiment started when the ozonated oxygen 
begun to run. The stirring speed was maintained at 750 rpm to ensure negligible external mass 
transfe r resistances during the experiments guarantying chemical regime (Martins et al., 2008) . The Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:

aqueous solution was saturated in ozone during the process . 
IV.6.2.3  Analytical Methods  
During the experimental period, samples were withdrawn in certain intervals of time to 
analyze Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biochemcial Oxygen Demand (BOD 5) and color and 
also access their toxicity and biodegradability by respirometry a nd luminescence techniques. The 
characterization analyses of the initial and treated leachate including BOD 5 and COD were performed 
according to Standard Methods (Greenberg et al., 1985) , in a WTW CR 3000 thermoreactor and a 
WTW MPM 3000 photometer for COD  while a WTW Inolab 740 was used to measure the dissolved 
oxygen for BOD 5. Color was determined by spectroscopy using a T60 (PG instruments) 
spectrophotometer. pH was attained by a Crison micropH 2000. Color data are reported as the 
absorbance of the sampl es in the wavelength of the visible region with the maximum absorption ( λ 
= 380 -750 nm) which is considered as a quantitative estimation of the color of the solution. Color 
depletion was followed by UV -Vis spectrophotometry with a T60 UV/Vis spectrophotome ter. 
Respirometric techniques were used to infer about the efﬂuent biodegradability and toxicity 
over activated sludge. Respirometry allows measuring the biological oxygen consumption rate under 
well-defined experimental conditions. It allows determining b iodegradability, toxicity and inhibitory 
effects with a real sample of microorganisms.  
The respirometric assay is used to determine the Oxygen Uptake Rate (OUR). The OUR 
involves an estimation of the biomass oxygen consumption rate when assimilating organi c matter 
giving the amount of oxygen consumed per time unit, and it was assessed by a WTW Inolab 740 
apparatus.  
The measurements are carried out by controlling the oxygen input and output in a liquid -
static -static (LSS) respirometer at 25±0.2°C. The variat ion of dissolved oxygen (DO) is plotted 
versus time and the OUR is then calculated

volatile suspended solids). The bacteria oxygen uptake rate (OUR), which corresponds to the slope

By examining Figure  IV.6.1 c) it can be seen that single ozonation led to an increase in the 
BOD 5/COD, which would favour the biological treatment even i f only a moderate COD removal (a )) 
occu rred. Moreover, it can be concluded that the oxidation process is strongly dependent on the initial 
pH (Martins and Quinta -Ferreira, 2011) . 
In fact, ozone oxidation follows two major pathways: at acidic pH, the ozone molecule is 
able to perform electrophil ic attack over the pollutants while for alkaline conditions the TEST  pH=3  pH=5  pH=raw  pH=9

178 decomposition of ozone and generation of hydroxyl radical (HO•) is promoted leading to chain 
radicalar degradation reactions (Gunten, 2003; Moussavi et al., 2009) . For pH intermediary values 
there is the combination of both pathways, and their efficiency can vary according to the 
characteristics of the effluent (Pera -Titus et al., 2004; Gogate and Pandit, 2004) . It is observed in our 
case that COD depletion was not dependent on pH until at leas t 10% of COD removal was achieved. 
However, the use of high pH values improved the efficiency of the process, with best results for COD 
depletion at pH=9 (34% decrease) while a very slight COD abatement is obtained after 1800 mg.O 3 
addition at pH=3, during  180 min of reaction.  
Figure  IV.6. 1 b) depicts the effect of ozone treatment on the color of the leachate. At pH 3 
and 9, the color removal efficiencies were 79% and 95% respectively, while the  intermediates  pH 
reached approximately the same efficiency, 80 %. However, it is important to refer that until the 
dosage of 1200 mg.O 3 of oxidation the test at pH 3 attained the second better color removal (higher 
than for intermediate pH’s) probably due to the fact that the initial chromophore groups in the 
molecule s are very vulnerable to direct molecular ozone attack (Wang et al., 2004) and therefore, the 
color was reduced eff ectively at acidic conditions. Nevertheless, for higher oxidation periods the 
radical pathway at higher pH’s prevails with superior color dec ay probably due to the oxidation of 
compounds that are refractory to ozonation.  
In what regards BOD 5/COD ratio ( Figure  IV.6. 1 c)) an increase from 0.05 to 0.33 was 
attained for pH=9.  For the remaining assays, although there was an increase along time, all 
BOD 5/COD were lower than 0.33.   
Respirometric techniques were still used to determine the wastewater biodegradability at the 
end of the experiment after 180 min reaction and its toxicological impact over activated sludge. It is 
observed in Figure  IV.6. 1 d) a biodegradability improvement after the application of the chemical 
oxidation process when compared with the initial effluent, effectively demonstrating that  pH 5 is the 
one that most  favors the  subsequent  biological treatment, reaching 30%. It should b e noted that 
the biodegradability measured by the  respirometric  method  gives smaller values than those attained 
by BOD 5/COD,  since that methodology measures only the  instantly biodegradable organic matter, 
while  the determination of  BOD 5   needs 5  days whi ch means that bacteria may have some time for 
adaptation to the pollutants.  
Moreover, the treated wastewater toxicity attained by respirometry remains 0 as the one 
observed for the initial mixture that was also null, indicating that  the oxidation process  does not 
produce  intermediate  toxic  products and that the effluent can be  discharged without  causing negative 
impact over activated sludge  in the biological  reactor .   IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

behaviour as function of time: a) normalized COD; b) color reduction; c) BOD 5/COD ratio and d) 
respirometric biodegradability after the treatment at pH=9  
Figure  IV.6. 2 a) shows the influence of the ozone inlet concentration over the ozonation 
efficiency and a maximum of only 10% of COD removal was reached at 60 minutes of reaction. 
After 3h of oxi dation, while 5 mgO 3.min-1 led to a final COD abatement of solely 7%, higher loads 
enhanced COD depletion, with 33%, 40% and 43% decrease when using ozone gas inlet of 10 
mgO 3.min-1, 15 mgO 3.min-1 and 20 mgO 3.min-1 respectively , meaning that after 180 min of reaction 
only a slight enhancement on COD removal in the order of ~10% was obtained at higher ozone 
dosages. As can be seen, two steps can be identified during the oxidation process (Gotvajn et al., 
2009) . Initially (up to ~60min), organic molecules are  transformed into smaller intermediates without 
significant COD changes where, however, a BOD 5/COD ratio improvement is observed ( Figure  
IV.6. 2 c)). In the second step COD depletion is accelerated in all experiments for ozone doses 
superior to 5 mgO 3.min-1.   
In Figure  IV.6. 2 b) the effect of the ozone load over the color of the treated leachate is also 
indicated. For doses of 5 and 20 mgO 3.min-1, the color removal efficacies were 75% and 95%, 
respectively. The best color removal, 95%, was attained with 15 mgO 3.min-1. It is then possible to 
conclude that with the increase on ozone concentration an enhancement of color elimination is 
observed. Since color is principally originated from the unsaturated bonds and higher quantities of 
specific functional groups,  ozone and HO• promote their attack, showing that higher ozone dosages , 
endorse initial oxidation reactions and subsequently produce less reactive species, (Chandrasekara et 
al., 2013) ; however, for concentrations above 10 mgO 3.min-1, differences are too s light with no 
significant improvement. The obtained efficiencies are in agreement with the values reported by Goi 
and collaborators (2009) that attained a COD removal of 41% and a (BOD 7)/COD improvement 
using pH 11  and ozone concentration of 42 mg.L-1. Bes ides, Tizaoui et al. , (2007) also reached a TEST  5 mg O 3. min-1 10 mg O 3. min-1 15 mg O 3. min-1 20 mg O 3. min-1

180 considerable color depletion (87%); however, the applied conditions (pH = 8.7 and [O 3] = 80 g.m-3) 
only led to moderate COD (27%) depletion and BOD 5/COD enhancement up to 0.2.  
Figure  IV.6. 2 (c) presents the BOD 5/COD ratio improvement from 0.05 to 0.33 for 40 
gO 3.Nm-3, against 0.13 attained at the higher dose, was observed. Moreover, the COD efficiency 
increase resulted, contrarily, in a lower biodegradable final effluent for ozone inlet concentrations 
above 10 mgO 3.min-1. This is due to the different operating conditions involving either lower 
production of intermediary bio -refractory species during the oxidation procedure, or higher 
abatement of possibly biologically  degradable  pollutants. In fact, once the majori ty of the degradable 
organics were oxidized, they do not promote the formation of more biodegradable products (Gotvajn 
et al.,  2009) , observed through the BOD 5/COD ratio decline. It seems  then that the use of high ozone 
loads is not favourable because effl uents biodegradability decreases with concentrations above 10 
mgO 3.min-1. 
Regarding the measured biodegradability by respirometric tests (d), one observes similar 
results when compared with the ones attained for the BOD 5/COD ratio where, for concentrations  
higher than 10 mgO 3.min-1, a decrease in the effluents’ biodegradability was detected, possibly due 
to the previously mentioned ozone scavenger effect.  Moreover, due to the high cost of ozone 
production, the higher dosages are not industrially feasible b y the great energy consumption, so it 
was concluded that the dosage of 10 mgO 3.min-1 was the most suitable for industrial applications . 
IV.6.3.2  O3/H2O2   ([H 2O2] and pH selection)  
The hydrogen peroxide dosage was estimated based in the stoichiometric relation 
(Eck enfelder, 1985) for the total COD abatement by this oxidant (Equation  IV.6. 4).

In this case, it would be theoretically required a hydrogen peroxide concentration of 4 g per 
liter. The experimental results for the degradation during perozonation regarding COD and color 
depletion are shown in Figure  IV.6. 3. The H 2O2 dosages were correspondent to 50%, 75% and 100% 
of that stoichiometric value.

O3.min-1 
The performance of this process was assessed at the pH previously selected (pH=9). When 
only hydrogen peroxide witho ut ozone was used (not present in the Figure ), insignificant reductions 
in color and COD were observed.  
As illustrated in Figure  IV.6.3 a), 43% of COD was removed within 1800 mg.O 3 for all the 
distinct amounts of hydrogen peroxide applied, reaching a fina l concentration of 1080 mgO 2.L-1, that 
permits a discharge to a municipal collector, with no noteworthy differences in the profiles for the 
different H 2O2 dosages, and this involved more 9% abatement when compared with single ozonation, 
showing thus an ove rall increase in efficiency of 28%. Nonetheless, the presented data show that an 
increase in hydrogen peroxide concentration will not always increase COD removal rates. In fact, 
increasing hydrogen peroxide dose may  change its role from being initiator for  the production of 
hydroxyl radicals to inhibitor of such radical reactions. As a consequence, COD removal rates do not 
diminish in this case but no improvement is observed either as referred (Goi et al., 2009) .  
For color removal profiles it is possible t o see through Figure  IV.6.3  b) that for different 
doses of hydrogen peroxide the results are very similar. Yet, there is a slight increase of color 
abatement with the amount of H 2O2, with 87% for the higher dosage and 81% for the test with 50% 
of the stoic hiometric value. Here the scavenging effect of hydrogen peroxide can be observed by 
presenting itself as an obstacle for the treatment enhancement (Tizaoui et al., 2007) , lowering, on the 
contrary, the values obtained by single oxidation . In what refers to  the final biodegradability 
improvement ( Figure  IV.6.3  d)) it is observed that the highest H 2O2 dosage promotes higher 
biodegradability being reached 27%, against the almost 15% achieved with 50% and 75% of the 
stoichiometric dosage, and the 22% reached by  single ozonation.  Hereupon it is therefore necessary 
to select an optimal hydrogen peroxide dosage above which a decline or no effect of this reactant TEST  50% H 2O2 75% H 2O2 100% H 2O2 Single Ozonation

182 over the treatment efficiency is observed; so a hydrogen peroxide concentration of 4 g.L-1 (100% of 
the stoichiometric value) remained the best for COD and color reductions, and biodegradability 
enhancement either measured through BOD 5/COD or assessed by respirometric techniques. Higher 
H2O2 dosages will have a greater cost for industrial application.  
In w hat regards  the evolution  of BOD 5/COD ratio of the effluent, Figure  IV.6.3 c), it is 
apparent that  a higher concentration of  co-oxidant  provides  an enhancement on this ratio, possibly 
due to the formation of  intermediate products easier to be biologically  degradable. In fact, for 
the different H 2O2 concentrations  the value  of this ratio  is very similar, 0.29 against 0.20 and 0.24 
for decreasing H 2O2 loads (100, 75 and 50 % respectively). However, for single ozonation a higher 
biodegradability is achieved at  the end of the treatment, though much lower values were initially 
registered, which can be explained by the formation of intermediate by -products with a higher 
biodegradable character. The obtained outcomes are similar to the results reported by Tizaoui e t al. 
(2007), that, at pH=8.7, with [O 3] = 80 g.m-3 and 2 g.L-1of H 2O2, achieved a COD and Color removal 
of 48% and 94%, respectively.  Additionally, biodegradability improved by reaching a BOD 5/COD 
= 0.7.  
In order to compare the two techniques (single ozo nation and perozonation) the results 
obtained for single ozonation (pH = 9 and 10 mgO 3.min-1) and perozonation (4 g.L-1 of H 2O2 and 
same pH and ozone concentration) are depicted in Table IV.6.2.  
Table IV.6.2 - Comparison of efficiencies of COD, color deple tion, BOD 5/COD ratio, biodegradability and 
toxicity by perozonation (O 3+H 2O2 with [H 2O2]=4.g.L-1) and single ozonation (O 3) after 180 min of

The gain / loss in what regards co -oxidant absence is also shown. In fact, for the performed 
operational conditions (pH =9 and [O 3] = 10 mgO 3.min-1), 2.86 mg of O 3 are required to remove each 
mg of COD for the single ozonation procedure. However at the perozone experiment, 2.25 mg of O 3 
per mg of COD depleted were required to reach a final COD value of 1080 mgO 2.L-1.  Throughout 
these  results it is possible to see that the perozonation process does not potentiate the total clearance 
of the effluent .  Indeed, in this case, the hydrogen peroxide addition only improves the removal of 
COD in 23% being, however, less efficient in removing c olor ( -9%), besides originating a treated IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

biodegradability is reached. For both systems the treated wastewater toxicity remains null, as 
initially .  
IV.6.4  Process Cost Eva luation  
In order to evaluate the reliability of the application of these treatment processes for such 
effluent a study of the operating costs was carried out for each of the tested methodologies.  
The ozone/oxygen gas stream was sparged with a constant flo w rate of 0.5 dm3.min-1 and the 
average production of ozone was around 1.2 g.h-1.The volume of wastewater treated in each assay 
was 1 dm3. The pH was maintained at a set point close to 9± 0.1.  For each liter of effluent 2.2 mL 
of 3 M NaOH solution were us ed in order to raise and control the pH during the oxidation and, at the 
end of the process, a variable amount of H 2SO 4 was added to reduce the pH to 7 so that the treated 
wastewater could be sent for biological treatment.  
 For the cost assessment the ener gy for the ozone synthesis and/or the cost of reagents were 
considered and for comparison of each kind of treatment the decrease in chemical oxygen demand 
(COD) was accounted for as well (Krichevskaya et al., 2011) . The ozone consumption was taken as 
the total ozone that was produced, the synthesis of which requires 20 kWh. kg−1 O3 (Twort et al., 
2000) . The cost of electric energy was considered 0.1276 €.KWh−1, the price market in Portugal for 
industrial applications. The fee of the hydrogen peroxide (50% w /w) was 0.35 € .L−1 while, from 
Portuguese industrial sources, the costs of NaOH (50%) and H 2SO 4 were assumed as 0.366 €.L-1 and 
2.09 €.L-1 per ton of each reactant.  
The operations costs for the wastewater treatment based on these data are shown in Table 
IV.6. 3 . The basic costs are fixed per m3 (€/m3) and per kilogram of removed COD (€/kg COD removed ) 
and are referent to the operational costs of the bench scale installation used in this work. The results 
provide the extrapolation from the actual cost to th e treatment cost per m3 of effluent .

184 The ozone production has the same cost for the two processes; however, with the addition of 
H2O2, perozonation would be more expensive. Thus although the addition of hydrogen peroxide 
endears the overall pro cess in 23% on the COD removed when compared with the single ozonation 
efficiency, reducing the effective cost in the relationship of € per kg of removed COD (14.11 € for 
single ozonation vs 12.06 € for perozonation), showing that besides the treatment price per cubic 
meter of wastewater, the real effectiveness of treatment on the COD removal suppresses the 
increment of the cost.  
The process shows to be expensive when compared with the overall operating cost (2.44 €.m-
3) of  an integrated  (SBR) Sequential Batch Reactor - PFS (polyferric sulfate coagulation) - Fenton 
oxidation system (Li et al.,  2009) ; however it is more economic than the system presented by Cortez 
and collaborators (2011) where costs with ozone based processes of 48.66 and 35.33 €.g-1 of COD 
removed are refer red  for O 3/pH  =11 and O 3/400 mg H 2O2 L-1, respectively. Besides, the same 
authors applied Fenton oxidation as a treatment for the same effluent achieving an operating cost of 
10.93 €.g-1 of COD removed.  
Finally, single ozonation achieves a COD removal eq ual to the legal threshold value for 
sewage discharge (1250 mgO 2.L-1), limiting  its applicability because no error margin is available for 
its extrapolation to the plant, requiring then a biological treatment in order to ensure the needed 
organic load rem oval, whenever process efficiency fluctuations may occur. Perozonation reveals that 
is more efficient on COD deletion (1080 mgO 2.L-1), besides reducing the cost per kg of COD 
removed, providing the possibility of disposal into a municipal sewage . 
IV.6.5  Conclusio ns 
The study showed that single ozonation and ozone combined with hydrogen peroxide are 
efficient methods to treat this leachate. Biodegradability indicated by BOD 5/COD and respirometric 
tests can be significantly enhanced when ozone is applied.   
Single o zonation at pH 9 endorses reductions of 34% COD and 94% color and augments 
biodegradability (BOD 5/COD = 0.33; 21% by respirometry), showing that this technology could be 
effectively a prior treatment for biological systems.   
COD reductions up to 44%, BOD 5/COD = 0.27, respirometric biodegradability of 29% and 
colour removal of 87% were achieved after treatment with O 3/H2O2 system at pH 9 and a H 2O2 
concentration of 4 g.L-1, permitting the direct discharge to a sewage collector. For this reason, 
hydrogen per oxide proved to enhance the treatment process when combined with ozone  despite the IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
185 increase in the overall operating costs, disclosing, nevertheless, to be more profitable in the cost per 
kg of removed COD.  
Therefore, the results attained in this work rev eal that ozone -based AOPs are promising 
alternatives providing the biodegradability improvement allowing a posterior biological oxidation at 
a lower cost; moreover Perozonation shows that was possible to reach an effective and unique stage 
of treatment, ac hieving the COD value that promotes a treated wastewater able to be discharged into 
a municipal collector  However, to certify and confirm the feasibility of the treatment as an effective 
solution, it is necessary to perform the treatment methodology at an enlarged time scale, so that the 
effluent variability could be assessed in order to have a real sense of its applicability at industrial 
scale .

187 IV.7  Utilization of Ozone Based Techniques for Industrial 
Effluents Depuration and Reuse  
IV.7.1  Introduction  
Industrial processes are potential sour ces of pollution entailing specific wastewater treatment 
as one important cost of manufacturing production and, attending to the decrease of water resources, 
its reutilization is essential for process reliability. In fact, actual environmental legislation is growing 
stricter imposing to the companies to focus their efforts towards wastewater depuration and water 
recycling which can be used in toilet flushing, garden watering, street washing and fire protection 
(Rivas et al., 2009).  
The agro and industrial e ffluents may have an adverse effect on environment due to the 
strong content of organic compounds involving, generally, high values of COD (Chemical Oxygen 
Demand), TSS (total suspended solids), BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) and toxicity which, if 
direct ly discharged into natural water courses can provoke disastrous ecological results (Beltrán et 
al., 1999).  
In recent years, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), in which highly reactive radicals 
(particularly H O) are generated, have been increasingly appl ied for the degradation of various 
classes of compounds. Among them ozonation treatment is an effective technology for removing 
organic matter from drinking water and industrial wastewaters (Matilainen and Sillanpää, 2010; 
Klavarioti et al., 2009).  
In the ozonation process there are two possible pathways to be considered: the reactions with 
molecular ozone (direct pathway), and the reactions with hydroxyl radicals produced by ozone 
decomposition (radical pathway) (Liotta et al., 2009; Pirgalioglu  et al., 2009). Both mechanisms are 
able to oxidize prevailing one or the other depending mainly on the medium  pH, and also on the 
wastewater composition and ozone dosage (Beltrán et al., 1999; Ma et al., 2005).  
In recent years, the application of new advanced oxidat ion techniques, such as catalytic 
ozonation in homogeneous or heterogeneous phase, H 2O2/O3, UV/ H 2O2/O3 and H 2O2/O3/Fe2+ 
(Matilainen and Sillanpää, 2010) allowed to achieve almost complete mineralization of some 
organics (Rivas et al., 2009; Martins and Qu inta-Ferreira, 2009). An effective way to increase the 
production of hydroxyl radical is through the addition of hydrogen peroxide once this combined 
system can initiate the decomposition cycle of ozone, resulting in the forma tion of those desired 
radical s. In aqueous medium the hydrogen peroxide is partially dissociated in ionic species (HO 2-), Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
188 which will react with ozone, originating chain reactions (Gunten, 2003; Gogate and  Pandit , 2004) 
where both radicals, hydroxyl and hydroperoxide, participate and degrade more effectively the 
pollutants. Several works relate the O 3/H2O2 system to treat pesticides were this process led to the 
formation of HO , which improved the degradation of all investigated compounds when compared 
to single ozonation ( Ying -Hui et al., 2006; Chelme -Ayala et al., 2011) as also was applied to treat a 
milk whey wastewater (Martins and Quinta -Ferreira, 2013).  
Beyond those referred applications, several references in the literature report the use of this 
methodology on the tr eatment of effluents from the food industry as is the case of the depuration of 
Baker’s  yeast wastewaters with a COD decrease of 43% and a color reduction of 91% ( Altinbas et 
al., 2003 ). Beltran and his collab orators (Beltrán et al., 1999) reached 80% of C OD conversion in 2 
h and a BOD/COD ratio improvement when olive waste waters where subjected to ozone and hydrogen 
peroxide  oxidation. In another hand, Campos and coworkers (Campos et al., 2009) observed 6.8% of 
TSS removal during the treat ment of seafood  wastestreams with 0.02 g O 3.g-1 TSS. Also in a similar 
reactor, industrial cork effluent was degraded by ozone and O3/H2O2 with a higher removal  efficiency 
for the last system (Lan et al., 2008).  
Some studies still incorporate UV radiation in O 3/H2O2 system. For example, Kestioglu et 
al., (2005)  treated an olive mill effluent obtaining a removal over 99% for both COD and total phenol 
content, while Zayas et al., (2007) , reached 87% of the COD degradation of a coffee wastewater 
within 35 min. The same enhan cement was observed by Lucas et al.  (2010), when O 3/UV/H 2O2 
system allowed a significant COD and TOC removal improvement when compared with single 
ozonation.  
The initiation stage is shown by reaction (IV.7.1) a nd the global reaction (IV.7.2) is 
presented:  
O3 + HO2  HO2 + O3          (IV.7.1)  
2 O 2 + H 2O2  3 O 2 + 2 H O         (IV.7.2)  
Direct oxidation by molecular ozone is usually slower when compared with the case where 
HO are formed. In fact, O 3 selectively reacts with higher electronic density sites  leading to sutured 
organic compounds; usually no further react with this molecule , originating an incomplete oxidation 
of polluting compounds.  However, the direct route is important if radical scavengers are present in the 
wastewater composition which ca n reduce hydroxyl radicals reactions (Gunten, 2003, Chandrasekara 
et al., 2009).  IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
189 Ozone has been applied to a wide range of waste waters because many contaminants are 
oxidizable within the advantages of rapid reaction rates, leaving few harmful by products in treated 
water, and produc ing oxygen as a reaction end -product. The sterilization of water supplies and/or 
discharges has been the traditional use of ozone (Rivas et al., 2009;  Chandrasekara et al., 2009).  
In this context, two distinct wastewaters were treated: one coming from a mill for vegetables 
washing (VW) and another one arriving from a chemical production plant (CP).  
Within this context, the main goal of the present paper is to investigate ozone -based 
treatments in order to achieve TSS, COD and TO C reductions to fulfill environmental regulations 
permitting the treated waters to be reintroduced in the process.  
IV.7.2  Materials and Methods  
IV.7.2.1  Experimental  
Single and hydrogen peroxide aided ozonation were carried out in a semi -batch mode being 
the liquid pol lutants charged at the beginning of the experiment and the gas continuously fed. The 
reactor consisted in a glass vessel (1 L of capacity) provided with magnetic stirring and two top inlets 
for bubbling the gas feed, by means of two gas diffusers placed in  the liquid bulk. In every 
experiment, the reactor was filled with 300 mL of wastewater. Ozone was produced from a pure 
oxygen stream (99.999% Praxair, Portugal) in an ozone generator (802N BMT, Berlin, Germany) 
with a gas flow rate of 500 cm3.min-1 with a n ozone inlet concentration of 40 g .m-3, measured in a 
963BMT ozone analyzer, Berlin, Germany. The perozone experiments were carried out with the 
calculated amount of H 2O2 being introduced into the reactor just before inputting the gas stream. The 
stirring  speed was maintained at 750 rpm, and a gas flow of 0.5 L.min-1 was maintain to provide the 
external mass transfer resistances negligible during the experiments (Martins and Quinta -Ferreira, 
2009), and guarantee the chemical regime (Greenberg et al., 1985) . Since this is a gas -liquid system, 
the kinetic regime (diffusional or chemical) is major issue regarding its efficiency (Lan et al., 2008).  
At regular interval times, samples were steadily withdrawn to measure the concentration of 
COD and TOC. In tests w ere hydrogen peroxide has been applied, after the samples collection, the 
reaction was stopped by the addition of a certain amount of NaOH, enough to raise pH to 12, allowing 
the decomposition of H 2O2 into water and oxygen. For TOC measurement, samples wer e filtered 
with 0.45 µm disposable filters for further analysis, as opposed to COD determination where sample 
solids also contribute. Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and Conventional Technologies  
190 IV.7.2.2  Analytical Methods  
Total Organic Carbon (TOC) was assessed with a Shimadzu 5000A Analyser, which operates 
based on the com bustion/non -dispersive infrared gasanalysis method. Chemical Oxygen Demand 
was obtained by the method stipulated in Standard Methods 5220 D: closed reflux , colorimetric 
method (Campos et al., 2009). The samples were digested during 2h at 148 ºC in a WTW CR 3000 
thermoreactor (Weilheim, Germany) and the COD value measured in a WTW MPM3000 
photometer. The Folin -Ciocalteau method was used to determine total soluble phenolics (TPh) as 
described elsewhere (Martins and Quinta -Ferreira, 2009) . 
 
The Total Suspended Solids (TSS) was acquired by Standard Methods “ 2540D: Total 
Suspended Solids Dried at 103 - 105 °C  (Eaton et al., 1995). To check repeatability, some 
experiments were randomly run in duplicate and the samples withdrawn were analyzed in triplicate 
to minimi ze the experimental error. The deviations between runs were always lower than 2% and 5% 
for TOC and COD results, respectively.  
IV.7.3   Results and Discussion  
IV.7.3.1  Characterization of the Effluents  
Two wastewaters were collected from industries located in Portugal and  their physico -
chemical charac terization is summarized in Table IV.7.1 .  
Table IV.7.1 - Characterization of the effluents.  
 
 
The vegetable wash effluent came from a carrot processing company and consists in a stream 
encompassing low organic content as it can be observed by the relatively low COD and TOC values 
(155 mgO 2.L-1 and 122 mgC.L-1) and the measured  only 1.1 mg.L-1 of Total Phenolic Content. 
Nevertheless, the effluent was subjected to a prior railing; however still had a high load in suspended 
solids (960 mg.L-1). A COD value of 1100 mgO 2.L-1 is imparted to the chemical processing (CP) 
wastewater as well as 273 mgC.L-1 in TOC and 100 mg.L-1 in TSS as well the absence of TPh.  Vegetable

191 Therefore, we decided not to follow this parameter along experiments once the legal limit for polluted 
streams discharge is 2 mg.L-1, well above our values.  
IV.7.3.2  Single Ozonation: Effe ct of pH  
All the tests were performed at initial pH with no control during the oxidation reaction.  
IV.7.3.2.1  Vegetable Wash Effluent  
The effect of pH over single ozonation efficiency was studied in the range of 3 to 9. 
Normalized COD and TOC reductions during the o xidation procedure of Vegetable Wash (VW) 
wastewater plotted against the experimental time over a period of 120 min are represented in Figure  
IV.7.1 when different pH values were applied.  
 
Figure  IV.7.1 - Normalized concentrations of COD a) and TOC b) at s ingle ozonation for VW as a function of 
time for different pH values at Normal Temperature and Pressure (NTP). [O 3] = 40 g.Nm-3 
It can be ascertained that the percentage COD removal increased with ozonation time and 
pH affects the way that ozone reacts wit h organic molecules. As seen, the pH effect on COD 
reduction by ozonation ( Figure  IV.7.1 a)) is pronounced for reaction times lower than 20 min for all 
experiments and for tests carried out at higher pH values this decrease is strengthened for further 
oxidation times, which demonstrates the importance and effectiveness of the radical mechanism in 
the degradation of pollutants. The highest removal was measured for the raw effluent pH (7.5), where 
more than 40% of COD was degraded within 60 min of reaction be ing achieved a final abatement of 
87% (after 120 min) reaching the concentration of 15 mgO 2.L-1. For lower pH values (3 and 5) 
degradation mainly occurred within 10 min (24 and 20%, respectively); nevertheless, for extended 
oxidation times low improvement was detected with only 32% of COD removal being attained after 
120 min for both opera tional conditions.

192 The reactions of ozone with hydroxide (IV.7.3) and hydroperoxide -ions (IV.7.4) initiate the 
ozone decomposi tion chain mechanism : 
O2 + OH  HO2 + O2           (IV.7.3)  
O2 + HO2  HO2 + O2          (IV.7.4)  
The next stage is the reaction between ozone and the superoxide radical (•O 2-), a major agent 
of the propagation of ozone decomposition, producing the desirable hydroxyl radicals (Reactions 
IV.7. 5- IV.7.9) : 
HO2 ↔  O2  + H+          (IV.7.5)  
O2  + O 2  O3  + O 2          (IV.7.6)  
O3  + H+ ↔ HO3          (IV.7.7)  
HO3  HO + O 2          (IV.7.8)  
HO + O 3  HO2 + O 2          (IV.7.9)  
However it is observed that higher pH (pH=9) originated a diminution on COD removal 
efficacy, with 78% of COD abated after two hours of treatment when compared with the 88% attained 
for pH = 7.5. This can be attributed to the significant value of IC (aproximally 50 mgC.L-1). IC 
content is due to carbonate and hydrogen carbonat e ions which are well known radical scavengers 
competing with the pollutants for hydroxyl radicals as described in reactions IV.7.10 and IV.7.11 : 
HO+ HC O3   O3  + H 2O         (IV.7.10)  
HO+ CO3 2   O3  + OH         (IV.7.11)  
TOC content of treat ed wastewaters was monitored during the reaction period in order to 
evaluate the mineralization degree and the results are shown in Figure  IV.7.1 b) for different pH 
values. As observed, a mineralization of about 33%, with a concentration of 44.2 mgC.L-1, is attained 
for pH = 3 whereas between 10 and 18% of TOC removal is obtained for all other pH values.  These 
lower values of TOC decrease when compared with the COD abatement are probably dueto the fact 
that pollutants can easily suffer partial oxida tion ( COD removal) while total mineralization is a 
hander task. The difference between the TOC and COD removal efficiency demonstrates that the 
final compounds are recalcitrant to ozone action leading to a large amount of degradation of COD, IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
193 87%, but a low perce ntage of TOC removal, and the consequent overall mineralization of the 
pollutants in the treated effluent isthen more complex to achieve (Rivas et al., 2009).  
Contrarily to COD removal, TOC depletion efficacy was found to decrease with alkaline 
conditions.  The TOC abatement behavior can also be attributed to the higher impact of the radical 
scavenging over the final mineralization of the by -products formed during the partial oxidation of 
the parent compounds (Pera -Titus et al., 2004). In this context, it wa s possible to reach 33% TOC 
depletion at pH=3, 18% at pH=5 and smaller than 15% for raw pH and 9.  
IV.7.3.2.2  Chemical Production Wastewater  
The treatment experiments for achieving the required COD and TOC of Chemical 
Production (CP) wastewater  removal over a period of 180 min are illustrated in Figure  IV.7.2.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure  IV.7.2 - Normalized concentrations of COD a) and TOC b) at single ozonation for CP as a function of 
time for different pH values at NTP. [O 3] = 40 g.Nm-3.  
Figure s IV.7.2 a) and b) show the evol ution of residual normalized COD and TOC with time 
during oxidation tests carried out at different pH values, fixed ozone dose and temperature in the 
depuration of the chemical industry effluent (CP). As it can be seen from Figure  IV.7.2 a), the 
percentage  of COD removal increased with an augment in the solution pH being the maximum COD 
depletion attained for a  pH of 9 with 64% of final elim ination, reaching the concentration of 400 
mgO 2.L-1. The ozone decomposition is directly affected by the solution pH a s already mentioned. 
However, in this case, contrarily to what was attained before for the VW, at the raw pH it is observed 
a decrease in the  oxidation performance when compared with the higher pH, with a removal of 51% 
similar to pH 5 in which 50% of COD degradation was reached, what proves that the direct ozone 
attack is a possible treatment for this wastewater, although at pH 3 only 33% of COD removal was 
obtained. These results reveal that the purification of the effluents can be promoted by directly or

194 indirectly oxidation pathways, involving either direct oxidation by ozone or attack of the pollutants 
by radicals.  
In Figure  IV.7.2 b) it is clear that the efficiency of TOC removal increased for alkaline 
conditions with 24% depletion after 120 min at pH 3, 5 and raw while the higher mineralization 
values were attained at pH 9 with 32% of TOC degradation, with a final concentration of 184 mgC.L-
1. 
The best results both for COD and TOC were then obtained at pH 9 with 63 and 32% of 
depuration respectively. I ncreasing TOC removal rates with the increasing pH can be attributed to 
the presence of hydroxyl radicals in the solution at the higher pH value since, as referred, these 
oxidant species have a higher reactive potential than molecular ozone leading thus to  better 
mineralization at high pH.  
Although the removals of COD and TOC vary with pH for both wastewaters, the pH values 
between 6 and 8 are more favorable for COD depletion of VW and CP effluents. As the raw pH’s of 
these wastewaters were within this rang e these were the selected values to carry on the following 
experiments. This also allows a cost reduction in industrial applications, since it will not be necessary 
to adjust pH, saving this way in reactants. Comparing these results one can generally obser ve a higher 
COD removal for VW for higher pH’s with 87% alongside to 50% of CP in alkaline conditions with 
pH=9.  
Since pH was n ot controlled during the experi ments it is important to known its variation 
along the reaction procedure. So for more acidic medi ums (pH=3) pH was maintained at a similar 
value with no alteration, but when intermediary pH’s as 5 and raw were it was verified that this 
parameter tended to 8 for CP effluent and to 9 for VW wastewater at the end of the reaction. The 
same conditions were  observed at alkaline pH. The increase in wastewater pH with ozone is thought 
to be due to degradation of volatile fatty acids formed during the oxidation procedure (Wu et al., 
2004).  
IV.7.3.3  Ozonation with Hydrogen Peroxide (Perozonation)  
Unless pH is increased,  ozonation does not produce enough (H O) radical concentrations in 
order to promote complete mineralization of dissolved pollutants. The recalcitrant  nature towards 
ozone of the substances present in effluents suggests the utilization of another way to inc rease the 
production of hydroxyl radical through the addition of hydrogen peroxide to ozone (Gunten, 2003 ;

195 This combined sy stem can initiate the decomposi tion cycle of ozone, resulting in the 
formation of the desired  hydroxyl radicals. In aqueous medium the hydrogen peroxide is partially 
dissociated in ionic species (HO 2-), which react with ozone, that when decomposed originates  chain 
reactions (Gunten, 2003; Gogate and Pandit, 2004) promot ing the effective pollutants  degradation.  
The implementation of this radical system makes degradation of refractory molecules 
possible, combin ing the advantage of selective molecular ozone  reactions and posterior non -selective 
free radical attack reactions ( Gogate and Pandit, 2004 , Azbar et al., 2004) at neutral pH medium.  
The hydrogen peroxide dosage was calculated based in the stoichiometry relation (Azbar et 
al., 2004) for conversion of an organic compound to CO 2 and H 2O2 endorsed by the peroxide 
oxidation of COD and is given by t he Equation IV.7.11.  
𝐻2𝑂2 (𝑚𝑔
𝐿)=2.13×𝐶𝑂𝐷 (𝑚𝑔
𝐿)       (IV.7.11)  
which can be translated into a stoichiometric equivalent concentration of 246 mg.L-1 (7.2 
mmol.L-1) of H 2O2 for the VW effluent and 2430 mg.L-1 (71.5 mmol.L-1) for the CP  wastewater.

196 Figure s IV.7.3 a) and b) show the evolution of residual normalized COD and TOC with time 
during ozonation experiments carried ou t at different dosages of hydrogen peroxide and fixed ozone 
dose, temperature and raw pH. The H 2O2 dosages were correspondent to 50% (3.6 mmol.L-1), 100% 
(7.2 mmol.L-1) 150% (10.9 mmol.L-1) and 200% (14.5 mmol.L-1) of the stoicho metric value given 
by the referred correlation.  
It can be observed from Figure  IV.7.3 a) that the COD removal increased with the augment 
of H 2O2 in the solution and total COD decrease has been accom plished within 90 minutes of 
oxidation for a concen tration of 10.9 mmol.L-1 but al so after 120 minutes of reaction for 3.6 and 7.2 
mmol.L-1. However, for a hydrogen peroxide concentration of 14.5 mmol.L-1 only 65% COD 
removal was achieved, reaching the concentration of 40 mg.O 2L-1. This fact is due to the high 
concentration of hydrogen peroxide which is well known by its radical scavenger effect when in 
excess (Equation  IV.7.12). This will lead to the consumption of hydroxyl radicals reducing, thus, the 
process efficiency as was already observed in other works ( Pera-Titus et al., 2004; M atilainen and 
Sillanpää, 2010 ): 
H2O2 +HO  HO2 + H 2O         (IV.7.12)  
In Figure  IV.7.3 b) the efficiency of TOC removal increased with increasing hydrogen 
peroxide concen tration. 50% of TOC was eliminated and a final concentration of 29.5 mgC.L -1 was 
obtained after 120 min when 14.5 mmol.L -1 of H 2O2 were applied. Similar TOC removal, 40%, was 
reached with 7.2 and 10.9 mmol.L -1 of hydrogen peroxide, and the smallest H 2O2 concentration led 
only to 33% depuration. So, contrarily to the COD removals, the TO C depletions were found to 
increase with the H2O2 dosage. This fact could be explained by the complex effluent composi tion, 
were exists an numerous  forms of  organic compounds,  some not  quantified  by closed reflux colori -
metric method, as volatile straight -chain aliphatic compounds (Greenberg et al., 1985) such as 
alcohol, sugars and alkenes, which means that, probably the initial COD value is under valorized. 
Those compounds can suffer mineralization (leading to TOC removal); however, since they were not 
accounted for the initial COD, their degradation is not identified regarding COD measurement.  
IV.7.3.3.2  Chemical Production Effluent Perozonation  
The experimental results for the degradation of Chemical Production (CP) wastewater during 
perozonation regarding COD and  TOC depletion are shown in Figure  IV.7.4 . The H 2O2 dosages were 
correspondent to 50% (35.7 mmol.L-1), 100% (71.5 mmol.L-1) and 150% (107.2 mmol.L-1) of the 
stoichometric value given by the Equation IV.7.11 .  IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Figure  IV.7.4 - Normalized concentrations  of COD a) and TOC b) at perozonation for CP as a function of time 
for different H 2O2 concentrations at raw pH, at NTP. [O 3] = 40 g.Nm-3. 
The performance of perozonation was evaluated at the raw pH selected previously (pH=6.8). 
As illustrated in Figure  IV.7.4 a), up to 96% of COD was removed within 180 min of reaction for all 
the distinct amounts of hydrogen peroxide, reaching a final concentration of 38 mgO 2.L-1. According 
to these values, the removal of COD is slightly lower when higher concentrations of hydrogen 
peroxide were applied. This phenomenon can be explained by the scavenger effect described above, 
where the excess of H 2O2 acts as radical scavengers reducing the availability of those oxidant species 
to react with pollutants.  
In agreement to what was previously observed, in Figure  IV.7.4 b) is showed that the 
efficiency of TOC removal increased with increasing concentration of hydrogen peroxide. 70% of 
TOC removal was obtained after 180 minutes with 71.5 mmol.L-1 of H 2O2 with a final concentration 
of 67 mgC.L-1. Nevertheless, similar TOC depletion, 65%, was achieved for the others peroxide 
concentrations used. It is therefore always unavoidable to investigate for an optimal hydrogen 
peroxide concentration above which a decline or no effect of H 2O2 on treatment would be observed.  
Within this context, it seems that, for the particular case of CP wastewater the optimal 
hydrogen peroxide concentration leading to the highest depuration values is the lowest value (35.9 
mmol.L-1), with which approxi mately 65% of mineralization was obtained saving this way reagents 
without significant loss of efficiency.

Within these results, a comparison between the performance of single ozonation and 
perozone, on COD, TOC and TSS at the end of the oxidizing procedure for the two studied effluents, 
is presented in Figure  IV.7.5. The experiments were run at the raw pH with an ozone concentration 
of 40 g.Nm-3.

Figure  IV.7.5 - Removals of COD, TOC and SST for O 3 alone and O 3/H2O2-based advanced oxidation, for the 
VW and CP at raw pH and NTP. [O 3] = 40 g.Nm-3. 
As observed, single ozonation can be an efficient technology to eliminate the COD content 
of these effluents. Indeed, ozone alone ensured COD removals of about 87% and 41% for V W and 
CP respectively whereas the combined O 3/H2O2 system increased COD elimination up to 100% for 
the Vegetable Wash and 96% for the Chemical Production effluent meaning that this combination 
improved in 17% and 56% the COD degradation when compared with single ozona tion for VW and 
CP, respectively.  
Looking at the effect of hydrogen peroxide, Figure  IV.7. 5 shows that H 2O2 increased the 
TOC removal rate by more than the double when compared to ozone alone due to higher hydroxyl 
radical production in the O 3/H2O2 system. For the VW effluents an increase from 13% to 33% was 
observed while for the CP wastewater mineralization the enhancement was from 25% to 66% 
comparing single with hydrogen peroxide aided ozonation.  
In what concerns the Suspended Solids, the fact of been able to reduce the concentration of 
suspended solids with the chemical treatment, allows the process to be carried out with no 
sedimentation and no signi ficant sludge formation (You and Tsai, 2010). However there is no 
important improvement f or the O 3/H2O2 system, attend ing that for CP the same removal was reached 
and for the VW wastewater only a slight difference of 6% was detected.

199 To gauge if the reaction mechanism is mainly going towards mineralization or oxidation, the 
Average Oxidation State (AOS) was determined an indicator of the oxidation extent of wastewaters 
treatment (Momani et al., 2004). This parameter is defined as a ratio between COD and TOC in 
molar units, and is calculated as follows through equation IV.7.15 : 
𝐴𝑂𝑆=4×𝑇𝑂𝐶−𝐶𝑂𝐷
𝑇𝑂𝐶         (IV.7.15.)  
where TOC is in molC.L−1 and COD in molO 2.L−1 
AOS indicates how chemical substances in the effluent become more oxidized: superior 
COD/TOC ratios imply a higher degree of mineralization (+4) while smaller ratios means pa rtial 
oxidation ( -4). In Figure  IV.7.6, the Average Oxidation State (AOS) is shown.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure  IV.7.6 - AOS to the selected tests of single ozonation and perozonation of VW and CP wastewaters  
As can be seen, the two effluents, different initial oxidat ion states for VW (+2.0) and CP ( -
3.2) show that VW has a higher oxidation state. According to these results, AOS throughout the 
different processes increase, which means that the final products are more oxidized than the initial 
substances. For the VW was tewater all the oxidant systems reach an oxidation state very close to 
total mineralization (+4) of the treated waste water after the oxidation period. For the CP effluent 
single ozonation promotes a partial oxida tion since low AOS values are always attai ned (below 0). 
However, the O 3/H2O2 system favours the complete oxidation of pollutants since AOS values closer 
to +4 were attained strengthening the role of hydroxyl radicals guiding reaction towards total 
mineralization.  
After a thorough analysis of the results, the VW effluent after perozonation (raw pH and [O 3] 
= 40 g.Nm-3) achieved 0 mgO 2.L-1, 38 mgC.L-1 and 23 mg.L-1 on COD, TOC and TSS, respectively. 
Whereby water for human consume must meet the maximum values of 30 mgO 2.L-1 and 25mg.L-1 of 
COD and T SS respectively, so this treated water reaches those values and could be reintroduced in

62 mgC.L-1 and 44 mg.L-1 on COD, TOC and TSS when ozonation aided b y hydrogen peroxide was 
applied. This stream could be used in the irrigation or in the other applications existent in the plant. 
It seems thus that perozonation promotes mineralization of the effluents revealing to be an attractive 
technology when compared  with single ozonation, as also referred in literature (Rivas et al., 2009).  
Ozone’s multiple uses for disinfection, by -products removal, along with the improvements 
in suspended solids make it an especially appropriate treatment process. From the results attained in 
this work, it was concluded that perozonation is a suitable technology for wastewater remediation 
leading to streams able to be reused according to Portuguese legislation; however toxicological tests 
would strengthen the viability of its applic ation to wash vegetables (Zoutman et al., 2011).  
IV.7.4  Conclusions  
The aim of this work addressed the study of the performances of O 3 alone and O 3/H2O2-based 
advanced oxidation systems to treat an agro -industrial vegetable wash wastewater (VW) and a 
chemical pro duction (CP) effluent with dis tinct characterization. VW had COD and TOC values of 
155 and 122 mg.L-1 respec tively and 660 mg.L-1 of TSS. CP had a moderate value of COD, 1100 
mgO 2.L-, 273 mgC.L-1 of TOC content and 100 mg.L-1 of Suspended Solids.  
The stud y revealed that ozone combined with hydrogen peroxide is an efficient method to 
treat those wastewaters. The main conclusions taken from this research were:  
 Single ozonation leads to COD reductions of 87% and 41%, TOC content removals of 
13 and 26% and a T SS decrease of 70 and 66% for VW and CP respectively;  
 Total and up to 90% of COD depletions, TOC degradations of 33 and 66% and SST 
reductions of 76 and 66% were achieved after the treatment with O 3/H2O2 for VW and 
CP respectively;  
 Hydrogen peroxide proved  to enhance the oxida tion process when combined with ozone 
in almost twice the overall efficiency in TOC removal when compared to ozone alone;  
 Best hydrogen peroxide concentrations of 3.6 mmol.L-1 and 35.7 mmol.L-1 were selected 
for VW and CP depuration, respectively, since for higher loads the scavenger effect 
reduced the treatment effectiveness.  
 Comparing the methodologies used for the treat ment of those effluents, we selected the 
perozone as the most adequate technique, which in addition to having achi eved the best 
results for those parameters, reached the better AOS values and also had the advantage 
of the low cost of H 2O2 compared with the cost associated with a greater amount of  ozone 
production for reach the same efficiency.  IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
201  In our case the treated water could be reintroduced in the washing vegetables operation, 
and the final CP effluent could be used in the irrigation or in the other applications existent 
in the factory layout.

205 IV.8  Integration of advanced oxidation processes and 
activated sludge for the treatment of high refractory 
industrial wastewater  
IV.8.1  Introduction  
Industrial activity generates large amounts of highly charged  wastewater comprising 
refractory compounds, involving mainly oil, greases and surfactants from the extrusion, cutting and 
washing phases, respectively, from the productive process. In this paper an effluent coming from a 
plant that produces automotive coa ting pipes was analyzed. Currently, the in -situ methodology used 
to treat this wastewater in the industrial unit was a Reverse Osmose System (RO) coupled with only 
a solids separation process based on a set of sieves and filters for the removal of solids u p to 100 
mesh. This procedure shows several severe drawbacks as the RO membrane stabilization 
performance, fouling, as well as the problems associated with the disposal of the resultant RO 
concentrate  (Bennera et al.,  2008) . In fact, the system showed to b e ineffective after three months of 
operation due to the variations on the composition of the effluent. The possible recurrence of the 
problem, constrains the decision to replacement the membranes, which constitutes a very high 
operating cost.  
Also, more f inancially appellative processes as the biological treatments are ineffective in 
practice due to the low biodegradability and composition changes of the effluent that do not permit 
microorganisms acclimation. However, when this conventional methodology is combined with 
chemical or physical systems, the reduction of the refractory pollutants and the consequent 
biodegradability improvement may provide conditions so that a further bio -treatment may be applied  
(Ribeiro et al.,  2015) .  
In this sense, Advanced Ox idation Processes (AOPs) emerge as suitable alternatives, able to 
degrade bio -refractory pollutants through the oxidation promoted by hydroxyl radicals. This is the 
case of the Fenton reagent, based on the oxidant power of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by ir on ions,  
recognized as a feasible and efficient process using low cost reagents  (Ribeiro et al.,  2015; Perdigón 
-Melón et al., 2010)   
Ozonation is also an interesting method operating at ambient conditions of pressure and 
temperature. This system allows ta king advantage of the oxidant power of molecular ozone that is 
able to degrade compounds comprising high electronic density groups. Besides, at alkaline medium 
or using hydrogen peroxide as a co -oxidant the formation of hydroxyl radicals is enhanced leadin g, 
generally, to higher efficiencies  (Martins et al., 2012; Amaral -Silva et al., 2012)   Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and C onventional Technologies  
 
206 One of the advantages of these processes, besides the possible mineralization of the 
pollutants, is the fact that they can also enhance the mixture biodegradability due  to the bio -refractory 
contaminants oxidation  (Martins et al., 2010) . This will allow the application of a posterior biologi cal 
treatment. However, the AOP s can also lead to products more toxic than the original compounds if 
reactions are incomplete. The e conomic factor is another restriction due to the high operational costs 
when high strength wastewaters are involved. A significant economic drawback derives from 
reactants  consumption (e.g. H 2O2), production of iron sludge waste for Fenton Process, in -situ ozone 
production power requirements for the ozone based processes, besides the high investment costs on 
adequate equipment and materials  (Poyatos et al.,  2009; Oller et al.,  2011) .  
The main objective of the present work addressed the setting up of an ap propriated 
technology to depurate an industrial wastewater from the coating automotive tubes industry reaching 
a final treated stream legally able to be discharged into the hydrological resources.

IV.8.2.1  Wastewater characteri zation  
The wastewater samples were collected from the industrial outlet stream of the factory. The 
effluent was characterized by a light -brown color. Table IV.8.1  summarizes the main physic -
chemical characteristics of the wastewater. As it can be observed,  it shows a moderate amount of 
suspended solids promoting turbidity. Moreover, relatively high COD and low BOD 5 levels are 
found, which leads to a BOD 5/COD ratio of about 0.11 revealing its low biodegradability. These 
characteristics seem to inhibit the di rect application of biological processes.  
Table IV.8.1 - Wastewater Characterization  
During the experimental period, samples were taken at certain interva ls of time. The 
efficiency of the processes was analyzed through Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) that was 
measured by the closed reflux, colorimetric method specified in Standard Methods 5220 D,

The oxygen consumption of a microorganism consortium obta ined from garden soil during 
5 days of contact with the samples, leading to the BOD 5, was determined using an automatic sensor  
HANNA HI 4421, and the pH was determined using a HANNA HI 4522. The Total Suspended Solids 
(TSS) were determined by Standard Meth ods: “2540 D: Dried at 103 - 105 °C” . (Greenebrg et al., 
1985)   
IV.8.2.2  Analytical Techniques  
During the experimental period, samples were taken at certain intervals of time. The 
efficiency of the processes was analyzed through Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) that wa s 
measured by the closed reflux, colorimetric method specified in Standard Methods 5220 D 
(Greenebrg et al., 1985)  performed in a COD thermo -reactor HANNA HI 839800 and a HANNA 
HI 83224 photometer. Total Nitrogen (TN) and Total Phosphates (TP) were also a nalyzed with an 
HANNA HI 83224 photometer. The COD analysis was performed with HANNA kits. Three 
available vials ranges were used,  HI93754A for Low Range (0 -150 ± 4 mgO 2.L-1), HI93754 B for 
Medium Range (0 -1500 ± 22 mgO 2.L-1) and HI93754A for High Range ( 0-15000 ± 220 mgO 2.L-1). 
In what regards to Total Nitrogen analysis was accomplished with HI94767 A (0 -25 ± 0.5 
mgN.L-1) and HI94767 B (10 -150 ± 3 mgN.L-1) whilst Total Phosphorous concentration was 
determinate by the HI 94763B (0 - 1.15± 0.02 mgP.L-1)   an d HI 94763C reactants (0 -32.6 ± 1 mgP.L-
1).   
Microscopic analysis were performed with a MOTIC BA 120 microscopy.  The pH was 
determined using a HANNA HI 4522. Total Suspended Solids (TSS) were determined by Standard 
Methods: “2540 D: Dried at 103 - 105 °C ” (Greenebrg et al., 1985) . The oxygen consumption of a 
microorganism consortium obtained from garden soil during 5 days of contact with the samples, 
leading to the BOD 5, was determined using an automatic sensor HANNA HI 4421. The methodology 
used with thi s inoculum allows to verify whether the wastewater is biologically assimilated by any 
consortium of microorganisms, permitting to compare the several tests as well as ensuring the worst 
possible scenario, quantifying the biodegradability, without any previ ous microorganisms 
adaptation.

208 IV.8.2.3  Experimental set -up 
IV.8.2.3.1  Coagulation  
Several coagulants, with different characteristics, were tested in order to treat this 
wastewater. Aluminum polychloride (Kemira Pax -18) and ferric sulfate (Fe 2SO 4), as well as an 
organic coag ulant, with the reference ADVP19, were used. Coagulation experiments were performed 
in a conventional jar -test apparatus (Velp) equipped with 6 beakers of 1 -L volume. Due to economic 
factors, the pH cannot be changed to values extremely acid or alkali, avo iding, for instance, new 
tanks construction with other materials. Moreover, this will diminish the costs associated with acid 
and soda for pH correction. Similarly, coagulant consumption, due to economic restrictions, may not 
exceed a maximum of 2 liters p er m3. The best operative pH (among 2 and 8) was assessed through 
the addition of 1 g.L-1 of each coagulant. Besides, the most efficient chemicals doses to COD and 
TSS removal (between 0.1 and 2 g.L-1) were determined for the previously selected pH (at amb ient 
temperature). Each chemical was added to 500 mL of effluent in the mentioned conditions. The 
procedure consisted in three successive steps: a stage with a quickly mixing for five minutes (120 
rpm) followed by 15 min stirring (15 rpm) in order to endor se the coagulation stage. Finally, after 
settling for 30 min, the supernatant was withdrawn and used for chemical analysis.  
IV.8.2.3.2  Fenton’s process  
Fenton’s oxidation was handled in batch regime using 1.5 L stirred glass reactors. The tests 
were performed using f errous iron sulphate (FeSO 4.7H 2O, Industrial grade, with 19.7% (w/w) of iron 
content and hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2, 49.5 % w/w) at ambient temperature. Generally, 1000 mL of 
wastewater with the pH corrected to 3.7 were introduced into the reactor and stirred . Different ratios 
between iron and hydrogen peroxide were tested, from 2:1 to 10:1 (w/w) (Durán -Moreno et al.,  2010) 
in order to verify the applicability of the process in a wider range, being the required Fe2+ dosage 
added, dependent on the selected [H2O2]: [Fe2+] ratio. The reaction started when 25 % of the volume 
of the H 2O2 stoichiometrically necessary to totally oxidize the initial COD value (Lucas and Peres, 
2010), which corresponds to 5.58 g.L-1, was added in two aliquots, at the beginning and at th e fourth 
hour of reaction. It was select this value due to the economic factors, since the costs with H 2O2 dosage 
is referred as one of Fenton Process application limitations (Poyatos et al.,  2009),  while the amount 
of iron could be optimized according tha t restriction since this is a cheaper reactant . 
The oxidation terminates at the end of 420 minutes of operation when NaOH was added until 
reaching pH of 11 to precipitate the iron in solution that would remove a fraction of the organic 
matter, promoted by the consequent coagulation step11, and quench the remaining H 2O2. Posteriorly, IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
209 after 15 minutes of agitation that promotes the iron flocks formation and the total residual hydrogen 
peroxide depletion (Martins et al.,  2010), a certain dose of cationic flocc ulant was added in order to 
improve the flock formation and consequent settling .  
IV.8.2.3.3  Ozonation  
Ozonation experiments were carried out in a reactor operating in a semi -batch mode. 1000 
mL of effluent were initially charged in a magnetically stirrer glass react or while ozone was 
continuously introduced through a diffuser placed in the liquid bulk. The stirring speed was kept at 
750 rpm to guarantee insignificant external mass transfer resistances during the experiments ensuring 
chemical regime (Amaral -Silva et al., 2012). Ozone was generated from pure oxygen in an ozone 
generator C -Lasky C -L010DS (AirTree), with a concentration of 2 g.h-1. Samples were periodically 
withdrawn for further analysis. In the perozone, the hydrogen peroxide was added at the raw effluen t 
before feeding the ozonated gas stream. On the controlled pH tests, pH was corrected at pre -
determinate time intervals through addition of NaOH (50%) and H 2SO 4 (37%), (Industrial grade). In 
what concerns the O 3/COD (w/w) a dose of 3.81 g of ozone per gra m of initial COD was used, due 
to the fact that the equipment used for ozone generation only produces a fixed concentration.  
IV.8.2.3.4  Biological Treatment   
The resultant treated wastewater was posteriorly refined by an aerobic biological system 
performed at laborat ory scale and executed in two small -scale Sequential Batch Reactors (SBRs) 
with an active volume of 400 mL. The aeration was provided by ceramic diffusers placed in the 
bottom of the reactors and connected to an aquarium compressor, promoting the air diffu sion with 
the aim of providing the necessary oxygen concentration to endorse aerobic conditions ([O 2] >2 
mgO 2.L-1).This was assured with periodically dissolved oxygen (OD) measurements in the SBR by 
using the dissolved oxygen sensor HANNA HI 4421. The comp ressor was linked to a clock that 
switches on and off this equipment, in order to divide the reaction phase into periods with and without 
aeration, and also set the settling and discharge phases.  
Both treatments were composed by four distinct sequential p hases:  reaction phase of 20 
hours, programmed to aerate in intervals of 30 minutes; settling phase 2 h; discharge phase 1 h; and 
filling phase 1h. The reactors were operated with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 20 days and 
the SBR was inoculated with 400 mL of sludge, from a biological reactor of a winery wastewater 
treatment plant, with 1500 -2000 mg.L-1 of Mixed Liquor Volatile Suspended Solids (MLVSS) and 
150 mgO 2.L-1  of COD in the supernatant. The low organic load existing in the reactors during th e 
startup allows the microbiota adaptation to the wastewater under study.  Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:  
Advanced Oxidation Processes and C onventional Technologies  
 
210 In one of the reactors, a selected microbial consortium by bioaugmentation (“BioSBR”) was 
supplied. The bioaugmentation process was carried with a selected microbial consortium (EU50 ) 
provided by the Biosystems Company. According to the supplier specifications this consortium is 
specific to treat water and soil contaminated with fine chemicals, petrochemicals and detergents and, 
to improve biological treatment, 45 g of the EU50 consor tium should be added per m3 of effluent. 
Therefore, during 10 days the referred quantities were used. Then the addition was made in every 4 
weeks. The biological reactor without bio augmentation as named “SBR”.  
Every day, samples were taken from the super natant to analyze the COD values. Moreover, 
microscopy was used for the observation of the microbial species allowing their identification.  The 
evolution of the protozoan community was assessed by the calculation of the Sludge Biotic Index 
(SBI) according  to the method described by Madoni (2004). The SBI is calculated considering the 
protozoan community dominant in the activated sludge, and the performance of the biological reactor 
is classified according to this value in four classes: Class I (SBI 8 - 10) - biological reactor has well 
colonized and stable sludge, optimal microbial activity and high removal efficiency; Class II (SBI 6 
- 7) - biological reactor has well colonized and stable sludge, almost optimal microbial activity and 
good removal efficienc y; Class III (SBI 4 - 5) - biological reactor presents an insufficient biological 
activity and mediocre efficiency removal; Class IV (SBI 0 - 3) - biological reactor with low biological 
activity and little efficiency removal.  
IV.8.3  Results and discussion  
IV.8.3.1  Coagul ation  
Initially, a coagulation study was performed in order to remove the solids and pre -treat the 
water for posterior oxidation. Several jar test experiments were performed to establish the most 
effective coagulation operational conditions. Initially, the  runs were performed with the intention of 
defining the most effective pH for a proposed coagulant dose of 1kg.m-3. Thus, pH was changed from 
3 to 8. These tests revealed that the optimal pH was 8, 4 and 7 for Pax -18, Fe 2SO 4 and ADVP19, 
respectively in wha t regards to TSS and COD depletion.  
To optimize the coagulant load, different doses ranging from 0.1 until 2 kg.m-3 were tested 
for the best pH attained for each coagulant. The data collected revealed that the optimal concentration 
of each coagulant was 0. 75 kg.m-3, 1 kg.m-3 and 0.2 kg.m-3, for Pax -18, Fe 2SO 4 and ADVP19, 
respectively, achieving at this conditions the best analyzed parameters removal rates as present in 
Figure  IV.8.1, where it is possible to compare the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and Total  IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
211 Suspended Solids (TSS) depletion, as well as the achieved biodegradability for the referred optimized 
operational conditions for each tested coagulant.  
 
Figure  IV.8.1 - COD, TSS removals and BOD 5/COD attained for the different optimized coagulation trial  
It is possible to observe that the most effective coagulant was the PAX 18 (pH =8; 0.75 kg.m-
3) with more than 23.5% of suspended solids and 6.2% of COD removal. This reduction led to an 
effluent with 9850 mgO 2.L-1 and 1760 mg.L-1 of COD and TSS respective ly. Besides, the ferric 
coagulation (pH =4 and 1 kg.m-3) only reaches a depletion up to 1% and 20.4% of those parameters 
(COD and TSS, respectively). The worst solids removal was promoted by the organic coagulant (pH 
=7 and 0.2 kg.m-3) with the abatement o f solely 5.2% of TSS. The fact that the solids removal 
percentage was so different from the COD results led to the conclusion that the solids are mainly 
inorganic and do not contribute to the global COD.  
The data collected show that coagulation is insuffi cient to attain an efficient depuration of 
this effluent, and that besides the solids content removal, a great amount of pollutants are dissolved. 
Thus an oxidation step is required for their elimination. Nevertheless, a biodegradability 
enhancement was ve rified for all the used coagulants, however all the tests reached a value lower of 
0.3, which is considered as the minimum for being subjected to a biological treatment .

212 IV.8.3.2  Fenton’s oxidation  
In what respects to Fenton’s oxidation, Figure  IV.8.2 shows the  COD removed for the 
experiments performed at different Fe2+: H 2O2 (w/w) ratios after 12 hours of reaction.  
 
Figure  IV.8.2 - COD and BOD 5/COD ratios for the Fenton experiments  
Attending that the hydrogen peroxide content is always the same, the effect of iron 
concentration on COD removal and biodegradability evolution can be assessed by the results 
depicted in Figure  IV.8.2 . It is possible to observe that the increase in the iron load dose  led to a 
better COD removal until the 5:1 test (77.5%) reaching a C OD of 2370 mgO 2.L-1. On the other hand, 
higher doses (10:1 test) inhibit the treatment efficiency due to the scavenger effect promoted by the 
excess of iron (Martins et al., 2010), with a final organic content degradation of 65.2%. For the lowest 
iron amou nt, 69.5 % of COD was eliminated, attaining a final value of 3200 mgO 2.L-1.  
It is still possible to visualize that higher iron concentration reduces the wastewater 
biodegradability. This behavior can be explained either by the oxidation and consequent rem oval of 
the biodegradable organic matter fraction in solution (reduction of BOD 5) or by the toxicity to the 
bacteria related with the iron added to the solution.  
As these tests were performed with the purpose of an industrial application, the trials were 
carried out aiming to achieve a COD value below 1250 mgO 2.L-1, which corresponds to the maximum 
allowable legal value for discharge in the municipal sewage. Fenton’s process was unable to satisfy 
this premise. Probably, increasing the H 2O2 and consequent i ron load, could further improve the 
efficiency; however the operational costs with hydrogen peroxide and the sub products formed as the 
iron sludge treatment are prohibitive for the industrial acceptance of this process (Poyatos et al.,  
2009).

Subsequently to the Fenton experiments where the wastewater debugging until a discharge 
value or either the biodegradability improvement until a value that allows biological treatment was 
not attained,  possibly due to the presence of refractory pollutants to the chemical oxidation, the 
potentiality of ozone, with its diversity of depurative mechanisms (direct and radical oxidati on), was 
tested as a solution to this problem.  
In Figure  IV.8.3 a) one can observe the COD depletion and the BOD 5/COD value achieved 
along the ozonation trials. It should be noticed that for the different experiments the same ozone inlet 
load (2 g.h-1) was  applied.Several tests were performed to analyze the impact of pH (that was fixed 
or changed along the treatment). Moreover, the impact of the application of hydrogen peroxide was 
assessed.   
In Figure  IV.8.3 b) it is possible to observe the pH variation du ring the experiments, and the 
BOD 5/COD profile for the trial with the best removal rate. It can be concluded from these results that 
the oxidation process is strongly dependent on the medium pH. In fact, ozone oxidation follows two 
major pathways: at acidi c pH the ozone molecule is able to perform a direct electrophilic attack on 
the pollutants (which is limited to high electronic density groups); while the alkaline pH promotes 
the decomposition of ozone and the generation of hydroxyl radicals (HO•) that wi ll unselectively 
attack the pollutants  (Zayas et al., 2007 ).   
For all the experiments, a similar COD degradation efficiency is observed for the first 200 
min of reaction whichever the conditions. This behavior must be related with the degradation of the 
compounds comprising high electronic density sites (such as aromatic rings) that are very reactive. 
That decomposition leads to the formation of low molecular weight carboxylic acids which explains

214 the pH lowering during the experiment where pH was left run  freely. These by -products are more 
refractory and molecular ozone is unable to further degrade them. In fact, for the case where pH was 
left run freely a final COD abatement of barely 51% was obtained after 1200 min of reaction.  
The use of alkaline mediu m (pH 10) slightly improved the process efficiency with 49% of 
COD degradation being achieved after 600 min when compared with the 30% attained for the case 
where pH was left run freely at the same experimental time. However, after this, a plateau with non -
significant organic matter abatement is observed and a final efficacy similar to the one attained when 
pH run freely is achieved. This should be related with the presence of some radical scavengers in the 
wastewater composition such as carbonates that inh ibit the hydroxyl radicals action over pollutants . 
(Amaral -Silva et al., 2012).  
In this context, in order to take advantage of ozonation dual mechanism (direct and radicalar), 
an experiment where pH was maintained at 3 during 400 min and afterwards changed  to 10 was 
performed. While for the first 400 min of reaction the COD degradation profile is very similar to the 
one attained for the last two experimental conditions, after this time (when pH is changed to 10) a 
significant improvement is observed. A fina l 98% of COD depletion is reached at the end of the 
treatment which leads to a COD = 220 mgO 2.L-1.  
In the first phase of the treatment (pH 3) molecular ozone is able to directly attack the initial 
pollutants comprising high electronic density sites. Moreo ver, at those acidic conditions the 
carbonates are converted into carbon dioxide and stripped from the water. This means that the radical 
scavengers present in the wastewater are removed, allowing that the hydroxyl radicals produced in 
the alkaline phase ( pH 10) further degrade the remaining organic matter. The presence of such 
scavengers in solution should explain the low efficiency of the case where pH is maintained at 10 
since the beginning of the oxidation process.  
The utilization of hydrogen peroxide as co -oxidant was still analyzed (pH 4 and a hydrogen 
peroxide concentration corresponding to 10% of the stoichiometric dose) (Lucas and Peres, 2009). 
These operating conditions improved COD removal when compared with the case where pH was 
freely adjusted leading to a maximum of 23% of degradation after 1200 min. Still, this result is far 
from the efficiency attained when a two stage pH approach was applied.  
Bearing now in mind the biodegradability of the treated effluent, the following conclusions 
can be a chieved from the BOD 5/COD final values also shown in Fig. 3 a): controlled pH (0.02) < pH 
running freely (0.17) ≈ perozonation (0.18) < pH 10 (0.22). The low biodegradability observed when 
a two stage pH procedure is applied must be related with the low fi nal COD obtained what points IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
215 out that the residual COD (only 2% of the initial value) is attributed to compounds not able to be 
biologically degraded, meaning that a further activated sludge treatment would not be appropriate.  
Figure  IV.8.3 b) shows the te mporal evolution of BOD 5/COD along the experiment that led 
to the best COD removal (two stage pH). As it can be observed, a biodegradability improvement is 
attained for the first 200 min of oxidation (BOD 5/COD = 0.28). This is probably related with the 
removal of the bio -refractory initial pollutants (too much complex for being bio -processed) leading 
to the production of low molecular weight compounds. However, the further mineralization of the 
wastewater leads to a depletion of the organic matter available  for microorganisms, promoting a 
decrease on the BOD 5/COD ratio.  
IV.8.4  Reactants cost evaluation   
The reactants consumption volumes for the controlled pH test are presented in Table IV.8.2 
as well as the final COD achieved , as well as the achieved COD removal. T he industrial price for 
NaOH (50%) and H 2SO 4 is 0.45 €.L-1 and 0.35 €.L-1, respectively. Ozone production requires 20 
kWh. kg−1 O3. The cost of electric energy was considered to be 0.1276 €.KWh−1, the market price in

It is concluded that the proposed treatment system has an associated cost in order to reduce 
the COD content from 10500 to 220 mgO 2.L-1. The NaOH, H 2SO 4 and O 3 consumption, leads to a 
cost of 33.04 € per cubic meter of treated effluent. Fo r the installation where it is expected to produce 
about 10m3 / day of wastewater this would lead to  an operating cost of reagents in the order of 330.04 
€/day, which results in an annual cost of  76239.24 €/year (for 21 days of work per month and 11 
mont hs per year).   Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:

216 IV.8.5  Biological oxidation  
Due to the high operational costs referred before, a treatment option as the biological urges 
as a possible option  (Durán -Moreno et al., 2010; Oller et al., 2011).  In this context, the possibility of 
integrating an activ ated sludge system with ozonation was assessed. So, ozonation was stopped on 
the oxidation time corresponding to the best BOD 5/COD ratio (0.28, 200 min of operation) and the 
pre-treated wastewater was able to be biologically oxidized.  The objective was to  find a stable 
treatment solution which complements the chemical process leading to a final effluent with a COD 
below 1250 mgO 2.L-1 allowing its disposal in the municipal sewage. Thus, the introduction of a 
Sequential Batch Reactor after the chemical treat ment was analyzed. In this study, the influence of 
the bio augmentation (BioSBR) was also tackled and compared with the traditional SBR systems, 
considered as the biological reactor without bio augmentation (SBR) . 
The biological reactors under study were f ed with effluent coming from the AOP process 
whose composition is described in  IV.8.3.

Figure  IV.8.4 - Evolution of COD concentration of the treated ef fluent (represented by points) and removal 
efficiency (represented by lines) of the reactors under study (“SBR” reactor and “BioSBR” reactor ) 
Analyzing Figure  IV.8.4 it is observed that, during  the 13th week of monitoring, the “SBR” 
reactor reached, on ave rage, 1487 ± 163 mgO 2.L-1 of COD and a removal efficiency of 73 ± 3 %. 
Until the 6th week the COD concentration of the treated effluent increased from 695 to 2052 mgO 2.L-
1 as a consequence of the increase of the organic load, due to the fact that the bioma ss was not 
previously adapted to this wastewater. The biomass was in a container and the supernatant COD was 
150 mgO 2.L-1. With the additions of increasing loads of OTE, the dilution effect vanished along the 
operation time, and COD increases. Indeed, the dilution factor is very important in this kind of 
treatment because it allows the adaptation of resistant microorganisms to the toxicity of the chemical 
effluent through the homeoviscous adaptation, this is, the modeling the fluidity of the bilayer from 
the cytoplasmic membrane in order to confer resistance to toxic compound  (Twort et al.,  2000) . After 
the 6th week the COD concentration decreased until 1121 mgO 2.L-1 (week 10). However, in the 11th 
week an increase of organic load in the treated effluent (20 51 mgO 2.L-1) is observed. At the end of 
the experiment this reactor showed a tendency to decrease the COD concentration (1651 mgO 2.L-1).  
The “BioSBR” reactor had on  average 815 ± 90 mgO 2.L-1of COD varying from 214 to 1673 
mgO 2.L-1, and a global removal ef ficiency of 85 ± 2%. Like the “SBR” reactor, the COD 
concentration increased until the 6th week from 214 to 1673 mgO 2.L-1, COD decreased gradually 
from 1593 to 620 mgO 2.L-1 (7th to 11th week) and stabilized at around 600 mgO 2.L-1 until the end of 
the trial . These results indicate that the bio augmentation is beneficial for the stabilization of the

218 The protozoan community is used as bio indicator of the biological treatment efficiency 
through the quantification of t he Sludge Biotic Index developed by Madoni  (2003) . The Figure  IV.8.5 
and IV.8.6 describe the evolution of Ciliated Protozoa (Swimming, Crawling and Sessile) and Sludge 
Biotic Index (SBI)  (Madoni, 2003) in the reactor with and without bio augmentation.   
Figure  IV.8.25 - Evolution of ciliated protozoa in the “SBR” reactor.  
Analyzing these results is observe d that in the first week of treatment both reactors had only 
crawlers in the activated sludge and presented a SBI of 10 which indicates that the reactors h ave a 
well colonized and stable sludge, optimal microbial activity and high removal efficiency according 
to Figure  IV.8.5 (Class I). This is due to the fact that the reactors were inoculated with activated 
sludge collected from the same bioreactor . 
In Figure IV.8.5 shows  that in the 3th week the community of crawlers disappeared and the 
swimmers appear in higher quantity (89%) than the sessiles (only Vorticella  at this point), and the 
SBI decreased to 5. This indicates that the biological reactor presents i nsufficient biological activity 
and mediocre efficiency removal (Class III), which is normal in this phase due to the microorganism 
adaptation to the effluent organic load. In the 6th week one can observe an increase of the SBI to 7 
(class II), because of the development of crawlers; this indicates that the microorganisms became 
more adapted to the effluent and now the reactor shows well colonized and stable sludge, almost 
optimal microbial activity and good removal efficiency. In the 8th week the SBI remai ned in 7, even 
though the community of crawlers dominated over swimmers. In the 10th week the community of 
sessiles reappear and the SBI increased to 10 (Class I). In the final analysis, the SBI decreased to 8 
due the augmentation of swimmers; however, thi s community is still in Class I, this is, the reactor is 012345678910

From Figure  IV.8.6 can s ee that in the 3th week the community of crawlers decreased from 
100% to 67% and the swimmers appear in high quantity (33%). The SBI decreased to 9 but the 
microbiological community is still classified as Class I, which means that the reactor is well 
colon ized with stable sludge, optimal microbial activity and high removal efficiency. Until the end 
of the experiment the community of crawlers dominated over the swimmers and the SBI increased 
to 10 and maintained in there, revealing that the reactor stabilize d with optimal microbial activity 
and high removal efficiency (Class I). This seems to indicate that the BioSBR is an interesting 
approach as a complement for ozonation.  
Although the OTE presents a biodegradability of 0.28, using  the BOD 5 determination 
method, the results of SBR treatment indicate that the biodegradable organic load in the effluent 
under study is higher probably due to the microorganisms adaptation during  the monitoring time, 
which consequently improved the removal efficiency of the biologi cal oxidation .

220 IV.8.6  Conclusions  
In this work several treatment techniques were applied to clean up  a high refractory industrial 
effluent.  
Physical -chemical procedures as coagulation showed to be ineffective with a maximum 
removal of 23.5 and 6.2 % of TSS and  COD, respectively.  
Fenton oxidation was also unable to treat this wastewater (leading to a final COD value of 
2370 mgO 2.L-1 which is not allowable for discharge into the local municipal sewage ) due to the 
presence of radical scavengers in the wastewater c omposition that limit  the oxidation . The 
biodegradability improvement  is thus insufficient to enable the application of a biological treatment  
A methodology that was able to provide  an effluent with the required low  level of organic matter 
was ozonation wi th different stages induced by pH variation, attaining 98.2 % COD degradation with 
a final COD value of 220 mgO 2.L-1. The main conclusions drawn from these investigations of  
ozonation and biological processes were:  
 Direct ozonation presents low efficiency on the depuration of this wastewater;  
 H2O2 addition on the ozonation at acidic pH improved the oxidative process efficiency; 
however, radical scavenger compounds as carbonates inhibit the method, limiting the 
oxidation extension;  
 Alkaline oxidation improve s the process; but the presence of radical scavengers in the 
wastewater composition seems to restrain the reaction.  
 The utilization of multi -stage pH leads to significant efficiency improvement. It seems 
that the initial acidic conditions are able to remov e radical scavengers , which will 
enhance hydroxyl radicals action during the alkaline stage. These operating conditions 
led to a treated wastewater within the limits for discharge into the hydrological resources.  
 The use of ozone for biodegradability enhan cement and the introduction of a sequential 
batch reactor afterwards showed interesting results and the bio augmentation is 
beneficial for the stabilization of the reactor microbial flora. Under those conditions a 
treated effluent with less than 1000 mg.L-1 of COD was obtained, which can be sent to 
the municipal sewage plant.  
The results obtained showed that ozone based treatment with different pH stages provides a 
treated water able to be discharge at the hydrological resources, but  also the potential of  
combining AOPS with biological systems leading to an enhanced and more attractive 
cost/benefit application.  IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

223 V.  CONCLUSIONS AND FORTHCOMING WORK  
In this section of the thesis, a general overview of the main results is presented, along with 
the most relevant conclusions. Finally, suggestions f or futu re work are recommended.  
V.1 General Overview and Concluding Remarks  
Under the frame of emerging cleaner production technologies, suitable treatment methods 
for industrial wastewaters urge to be developed. The biological treatments are the most widely used 
depurative technologies. Nevertheless, these systems encompass several drawbacks when applied to 
effluents containing non -biodegradable, bio recalcitrant and/or toxic pollutants. Moreover, those 
technologies are extremely sensitive when changes in the effluen t matrix happen. The strategy of 
coupling chemical (by application of the Fenton process or ozone based technologies) and biological 
systems is a good alternative to minimize these fluctuations or as an alternative when biological 
treatment per si  is ineff ective.   
Advanced oxidation methods (AOPs) are considered to enhance existing treatment 
technologies, being complementary or even replace them. These processes chemically modify the 
structure of the pollutants, by transforming them into less toxic and bio degradable intermediates, 
allowing then a biological procedure, to complete the degradation of the pollutant load in a shorter 
time and in a less expensive way. Chemical and biological treatments must be always monotorized 
to ensure that the chemical pretr eatment induces beneficial effect on the biocompatibility of the 
treated wastewater.  
Therefore, we can conclude that the two oxidative processes depicted throughout this thesis 
are different, and therefore inferred different conclusions about their applic ation.  
Fenton Oxidation was applied seeking for a suitable treatment for three distinct wastewaters.  
Winery wastewater was submitted to an integrated coagulation -Fenton -like system that 
enables a synergetic effect of both treatments. The coagulation step l eads to COD and TSS reductions 
of 25 % and 40.7 %, maintaining an iron content as well as an acidic pH that enables the oxidative 
stage. The oxidation step, where 10 % of the stoichiometric oxidant dosage was applied, leads to a 
COD reduction of 42% and a BOD 5/COD improvement of 60%, with a final content of 59 ppm of 
iron. At the end of this two stage process also 89% and 80% of Total Phosphorous and Nitrogen were Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:

224 removed. The combined process endorses a COD removal of 56.6% and enhanced the wastewater 
biodegradability (BOD 5/COD = 0.4), showing that it could be efficiently used as prior treatment to a 
subsequent biological systems. Thus, with the application of a posterior biological treatment, it was 
possible attaining 95% of efficiency removal after comple te adaptation of the biological system. The 
obtained treated water characteristics were within the legal required limits, permitting the direct 
discharge into the hydrological resources or even for reuse purposes. The operating costs inherent to 
the coagul ation -oxidative process were of 0.27 € per kg of removed COD. The Fe 2(SO 4)3 amount, 
represents 40% of the total costs, and the sum of NaOH and H 2SO 4 dosages costs are very similar to 
those of the oxidant, reaching 26%.  
The performance of laboratorial Fento n’s peroxidation over the elderberry juice production 
wastewater treatment leads to an effluent within the legal limits, allowing its discharge throughout 
the hydric resources, since the final COD, BOD 5 and TSS values accomplished the legal limits for 
those parameters to be discharged into the hydrological courses (150 mgO 2.L-1, 40 mgO 2.L-1 and 60 
mg.L-1, equivalent to removals of 78%, 90% and 63%, respectively). Moreover, a BOD 5/COD 
improvement of 600% was reached. This treatment system entailed an operati ng cost of 4.384 €.m-3. 
The process was extremely dependent on the [H 2O2]: [Fe2+] ratio (5:1), but the major 
significant improvement is determined by the reactants concentration.  The best results were attained 
with the operational conditions of initial pH =3, [H 2O2]: [Fe2+] =20:5 mM. A unique pre -acidification 
stage before the oxidative process revealed to be a better approach than correcting pH during the 
process. For lower [H 2O2]: [Fe2+] chemical coagulation prevails, and to a [Fe2+] =20 mM, the TDS 
conce ntration drops when compared with 10 mM, showing that iron dosage is strictly related with 
the coagulation stage, and in this sense it is necessary to optimize this dosage in order to take 
advantage of the synergistic effects of both phases (oxidation and coagulation) in the Fenton process.  
It was possible to achieve significant removal efficiencies when OMW was subjected to 
coagulation/flocculation. In fact, this process led to a high phenol and COD removal (82 and 84% 
respectively) as well as a BOD 5/COD improvement (0.20 against the initial 0.05). Moreover, the 
further combination with Fenton process revealed larger COD and total phenol content abatement 
(90% and 92%) and a biodegradability enhancement to 0.52 in relation with the raw wastewater thus 
enab ling the availability of a posterior application of an aerobic biological treatment. On the other 
hand, the addition of minor amounts of hydrogen peroxide over the time reaction significantly favors 
the Fenton’s oxidation. The precipitation step also remov es organic compounds, indicating that in 
addition to precipitate ferrous sludge, it acts as a polishing stage in what regards to COD removal.  V. CONCLUSIONS AND FORTHCOMING WORK  
225 In another work with a different olive mill wastewater the coagulation stage achieves COD 
reductions of 38% and 40 % of TSS. The global process (involving coagulation and Fenton’s process) 
allows attaining an overall COD removal of 85% which permits the wastewater discharge into the 
municipal collector. This system entailed a cost of 1.44€ per kg of removed COD. Therea fter these 
conditions were extrapolated to a real WWTP where, the evolution of the efficiency of each stage of 
treatment was significant. The coagulation was able to remove 30% of COD in the first day and 50% 
in the last one, while the Fenton´s oxidation e fficiency ranged from 40 until a 90% in the last day, 
with [[H 2O2]: [Fe2+] ratios changing  between 7.5:1 and 10:1. The treatment attained an average 
efficiency of 43% on the coagulation and 62% on the oxidation stage increasing the wastewater 
biodegradabi lity from 0.03 to 0.37 enabling the posterior application of biological treatment. The 
treatment has a real average cost of 1.09€ per kg of removed COD.  
Main conclusions from Fenton’s process studies:  
 Fenton process is effective and its application is econ omic viable when it is applied  to 
increase biodegradability and reduce toxicity of the wastewaters,  
 Applying a coagulation stage favors significantly the posterior oxidation process, to 
reduce COD and TSS, but above all to minimize the load variations in  order to stabilize 
the efficiency of the Fenton’s process;  
 [H2O2]:[COD] and  [H 2O2]: [Fe2+] ratios should be optimized to the lower value in order 
to instigate the partial oxidation and not mineralization and favor the coagulation stage, 
taking advantage of these synergetic effect and reducing the operational costs;  
 The Fenton’s precipitation stage promotes organic compounds removal, indicating that 
in addition to precipitate ferrous sludge, it acts as a polishing stage in what regards to 
COD removal.  
Ozon e based treatment shows to have potential to depurate four distinct wastewaters. The 
main goals were to increase the biodegradability so that a posterior biological oxidation is possible, 
obtaining an effluent able to direct discharge into the hydrological  resources or even reutilization of 
the treated water.  
The depuration of two different effluents, vegetable wash (VW) and chemical production 
(CP), was investigated by ozonation and O 3/H2O2 focusing the treated water reuse. The experiments 
show that hydrog en peroxide enhance the oxidation process when combined with ozone in almost 
twice the overall efficiency in TOC removal when compared to ozone alone. The addition of 35.7 Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:

226 mmol.L-1 H2O2 increment COD depletions to 100% (0 mgO 2.L-1) vs 87%, TOC abstractions  of 33% 
(38 mgC.L-1) vs 13% after 120 min for the VW; in that concerns the CP, the use of 3.6 mmol.L-1 
(H2O2) allows to obtain removals of 96% (38 mgO 2.L-1) vs 41 %, 66% (62 mgC.L-1) vs 26% for COD 
and TOC respectively after 180 minutes of oxidation. In th e single ozonation experiments pH shows 
to be the most important  variable, reaching COD removals  of 87% for VW for higher pH’s , and 
50% of CP  with pH=9. The O 3/H2O2 system favors the complete oxidation of pollutants since AOS 
values closer to +4 were a ttained strengthening the role of hydroxyl radicals guiding reaction towards 
total mineralization. The treated water could be reintroduced in the washing vegetables operation, 
and the final CP effluent could be used in the irrigation or in other applicatio ns existent in the factory 
layout.  
A landfill leachate characterized by moderate COD value, 1880 mg O 2.L-1, very low 
biodegradability (BOD 5/COD = 0.05) was treated by single ozonation and ozone combined with 
hydrogen peroxide. Single ozonation at pH 9 endo rses reductions of 34% of COD and 94% of color 
and augments biodegradability (BOD 5/COD = 0.33; 21% by respirometry), showing that this 
technology could be effectively used as a prior treatment for biological systems. However, the 
addition of 4 g.L-1 of H 2O2, enhanced the COD reduction to 44 %; however, this system was less 
efficient in what regards color depletion ( -9%), besides originating a treated effluent with a lower 
BOD 5/COD ratio ( -12%) when compared with single ozonation. Nevertheless, the ozone + hy drogen 
peroxide system led to an effluent able to be directly discharged to a sewage collector.Moreover the 
addition of hydrogen peroxide reduces the treatment cost per kg of removed COD (14.11 € for single 
ozonation vs 12.06 € for perozonation).  
A high re fractory industrial effluent was studied in order to accomplish a treated water able 
to be discharges into the hydrological resources or, if not possible, to a municipal sewage. Several 
experiments with different procedures as coagulation and Fenton oxidat ion showed to be ineffective 
with a maximum removal of 23.5 and 6.2 % of TSS and COD, respectively. Different strategies of 
ozone based processes were attempted, showing that single ozonation presents low efficiency. , H 2O2 
addition at acidic/neutral pH im proved the oxidative process efficiency; however, radical scavenger 
compounds as carbonates inhibited the method, limiting the oxidation extension.  Multi -stage pH’s 
ozonation led to an efficiency improvement. Initial acidic conditions allowed removing rad ical 
scavengers, what will enhance hydroxyl radicals action during the alkaline stage after NaOH 
addition, attaining 98.2 % of COD degradation with a final COD value of 220 mgO 2.L-1 after 1200 
min of operation. Thus, the treated water was within the limits  for discharge into the municipal 
wastewater treatment plant.  It was observed that a biodegradability improvement was attained at 
200 min of oxidation (BOD 5/COD = 0.28), and for this reason the integration of a biological 
treatment was tested with bio aug mentation. The final COD stabilized around 600 mgO 2.L-1 until the V. CONCLUSIONS AND FORTHCOMING WORK  
227 end of the experiment, originating a treated effluent with less than 1000 mgO 2.L-1. Thus, the treated 
wastewater can be con ducted to the municipal sewage.  
Main conclusions  from ozonation stu dies:  
 the combination of pH variations  and co -oxidant additions are essential for the best use 
of both oxidative mechanisms (electrophilic attack and hydroxyl radicals);  
 the H 2O2 addition on the ozonation improves the oxidative process efficiency since i t 
enhaces the production of hydroxyl radicals ; 
 initial acidic conditions promote the radical scavengers removal, which will enhance 
hydroxyl radicals action during oxidative mechanisms;  
 ozone -based AOPs are promising alternatives providing the  effluent  biodegradability 
improvement allowing a  posterior biological oxidation .  Integration Strategies for Wastewater Treatment:

228 V.2 Forthcoming Work  
The results of the present work reveal the importance of Fenton’s process and ozonation 
for the depuration of bio -refractory liquid effluents. Moreover, these chemical methodologies can be 
envisioned as a part of an integrated scheme allowing partial degradation of the bio -refractory 
fraction after or before an economical biological reactor. In addition, it was clear the need of carrying 
out investigation for the charact erization of each wastewater in order to provide the best depuration 
solution for each case. The most crucial issue of the Advanced Oxidation Processes application at 
industrial scale is the maintenance of the real efficiency during the productive cycle an d the 
operational costs of the entire treatment.  
Thus main purpose of the proposed work is to extrapolate the laboratory investigation to 
the physical application. For this a scale not lower than 10,000 X higher (1L to 10 m3) should be 
used. Only this way , reliable data regarding the real application of thes e technologies can be gathered.  
For this main purpose the following issues are requested : 
 Carry out AOPs laboratory assays with a time scale that allows to identify the processes 
behavior when the waste water characteristics change;  
 Chemical oxidation experiments using optimized reactant dosages should be performed 
with the wastewaters taken from the production site at different times, because of 
fluctuations in the wastewater quality ; 
 The integration of physic al-chemical processes is required, involving particular 
processes such as the coagulation / flocculation and filtration, in order to minimize the 
solids and organic content load variations,  as well as  to maintain the pH for the reaction, 
preserving t he procedural efficiency;  
 Develop methods for automated control to chemicals dosage and operating conditions 
(pH), assessing the performance of the process according the wastewater variability;  
 Optimize the AOPs in a way that the operating costs (tak ing only into account the  
reagents) do not pass the threshold of 3 -4 €.m-3, charge for which the companies showed 
interest in pay ing when  compared with existing depurative techniques (reverse osmosi s, 
nano -filtration, evaporation ; coagulation / adsorption), t urning these processes aside 
from effective, competitive;  V. CONCLUSIONS AND FORTHCOMING WORK  
229  Study and analyze the application of biological treatments after the implementation of 
AOPs, with the variability of the output effluent (residual reactants, COD and BOD 5) to 
a time scale that allow s to assess their in situ viability, instead of evaluating  only the 
biodegradability of the laboratory assays . 
Individually for each investigated AOP  it is proposed:  
Fenton oxidation  
 To analyze the effect of TSS variation in the Fenton process;  
 To develop methodologies in order to enhance thickening and handling of iron based 
sludge originated  during Fenton process;  
 To develop strategies to reuse the iron sludges as coagulant or as catalyst.  
Ozone based processes  
 To analyze the e ffect of TSS and TDS variat ion, to assess the efficiency of the 
oxidation process ; 
 To d evelop  units with simple and effective methodologies of coagulation and 
membrane filtration  as pre -treatment for ozonation ; 
 To develop  multi -stages reactors that allow pH changes and others oxidan ts addition 
in differents sections of the same unit.  
After completing this work, one can predict that with the integration of those technologies, 
with some complementary processes such as membranes, it is possible to achieve treatment 
efficiencies that all ows to attain an output water with all the requirements to be reused.  
The presented  processes integration scheme ( Figure  V.2.1) involving coagulation, chemical 
oxidation, biological and other chemical oxidation, complemented with an ultrafiltration system  after 
the biological treatment, and a  reverse osmosis as a safety system seems to be  an effective strategie 
for an effluent depuration with the aim to fulfil the drinking water requirements.
