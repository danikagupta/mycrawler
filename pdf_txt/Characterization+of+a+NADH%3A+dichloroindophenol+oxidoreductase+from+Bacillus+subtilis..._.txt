 Summary of the thesis 
The soil-dwelling bacterium Bacillus subtilis  is regarded as model organism for 
functional genomic research of low GC Gram- positive bacteria. Several stress and starvation-
responsive stimulons have b een extensively studied in B. subtilis  using transcriptomic and 
proteomic approaches. However, there was only  little information about the response of B. 
subtilis  to toxic phenolic compounds, which are often found in the soil.  The group of Haike 
Antelmann has monitored the expression profile of B. subtilis  after exposure to phenol, 
salicylic acid, catechol, chromanon and MHQ. Interestingly, proteome and transcriptome 
analyses showed a strong overlap in the expr ession profile after expos ure to catechol, MHQ 
and the thiol-reactive electrophile diamide. Later on it was shown that catechol and MHQ are 
auto-oxidized to electrophilic quinones which target thiols via the thiol-(S)-alkylation reaction 
leading to aggregation and depletion of LM W thiols and thiol-containing proteins.  
The response to electrophili c quinones and diamide is governed by a complex network 
of transcription factors, including Spx, CtsR, PerR, CymR and the novel MarR-type 
repressors MhqR (YkvE), YodB  and YvaP. The regulatory mechanisms of these novel thiol-
stress sensors YodB and YvaP are studied as part of this thesis in collaboration with the group 
of Peter Zuber (Oregon). YodB negatively regu lates the expression of the nitroreductase 
YodC and the azoreductase YocJ (AzoR1) af ter exposure to electr ophilic quinones and 
diamide. The azoreductase AzoR1 is a paralog of  AzoR2 that is under control of MhqR. Both 
paralogous azoreductases (AzoR1 and AzoR2) have common functions in quinone and azo-
compound reduction to protect cells  against the thiol reactivity of electr ophiles. The group of 
Peter Zuber (Oregon) found that DNA binding activity  of YodB is directly inhibited by thiol-
reactive compounds in vitro.  Mass spectrometry approaches s uggested that YodB is regulated 
by a thiol-(S)-alkylation mechanism in response  to quinones. Mutational analyses revealed 
that the conserved Cys6 residue of Y odB is required for optimal repression in vivo and in 
vitro . Recent studies further suggest that YodB  is redox-regulated by intersubunit disulfide 
formation in vivo  by diamide.  
In addition to the azoreductases, se veral MhqR-controlled thiol-dependent 
dioxygenases (MhqA, MhqE and MhqO) confer resi stance to quinones. In collaboration with 
Kazuo Kobayashi (Nara), the YodB-paralogou s MarR/DUF24-family regulator, YvaP was 
identified as repressor of th e catechol-2,3-dioxygenase encoding yfiDE  (catDE ) operon. DNA 
binding activity of YvaP was also dire ctly inhibited by quinones and diamide  in vitro  
indicating that also YvaP is regulated via post-translational m odifications. Mutational 
analyses showed that the conserved Cy s7 is essential for YvaP regulation in vivo and serves as 
sensor for thiol-reactive compounds . In addition, also the basic amino acids K19, R20 are 
essential for YvaP repression in vivo as well as conserved basic arginine and lysine residues 
located in the DNA binding helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif. Non-reduc ing PAGE analysis Nguyen Thi Thu Huyen  iii Summary  
 suggests the formation of an intersubunit disu lfide bond in a YvaP di mer upon treatment with 
quinones and diamide in vitro . 
Together these data show that B. subtilis  has evolved a networ k of three MarR-type 
repressors YkvE (MhqR), YodB and YvaP th at control paralogous quinone resistance 
determinants including quinone reductases (A zoR1 and AzoR2) and thiol-dependent ring-
cleavage enzymes (CatE, MhqA, MhqE and MhqO ). These thiol-stress responsive regulators 
confer resistance and allow adaptation to quinone-like electrophiles and diamide as novel 
physiological mechanism for Gram-positive bacteria.  
Besides quinones, also α,β-unsaturated carbonyls are electrophilic compounds which 
react via the thiol-(S)-alkylation reaction with thiols . Thus, we were also interested in the 
response of B. subtilis  to the toxic electroph iles methylglyoxal (MG) and formaldehyde (FA). 
We analyzed the changes in the transcriptome and proteome of B. subtilis  after exposure to 
MG and FA. Like quinone compounds, both MG and FA induce the thiol-specific stress 
response as revealed by the i nduction of the CtsR, PerR, Spx, CymR, YodB, YvaP, ArsR and 
CsoR regulons. Metabolomic approaches confir med that these reactive aldehydes deplete the 
cellular thiol pool and thus act like quinones as another class of  thiol-reactive electrophiles. 
Additionally, MG and FA also triggered res ponses to overcome DNA damage as revealed by 
the induction of the SOS regulon. Our studies furt her revealed the spec ific induction of two 
FA detoxification pathways regulated by the MarR/DUF24 family repressor HxlR, and the 
novel MerR/NmlR-type regulator YraB (A dhR). HxlR positively regulates the hxlAB  operon 
encoding the ribulose monophosphate path way. AdhR positively regulates an adhA-yraA  
operon that encodes the thiol-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (AdhA) and the 
DJ1/PfpI-like cysteine pr oteinase (YraA), and the yraC  gene that encodes a γ-
carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase. Thus, the AdhR regulon is involved in the 
detoxification of FA to formate via the formaldehyde dehydrogenase AdhA which catalyzes 
the cleavage of S-hydroxymethylcysteine adducts. In addition, the cystei ne proteinase YraA 
could be involved in the degradation of S-hydroxymethylcysteine-modified and damaged 
protein thiols. In collaboration with the group of John Helmann (Ithaca), it was shown that 
AdhR binds  in vitro to a conserved inverted repeat between  the -10 and -35 promoter elements 
upstream of adhA , yraB  and yraC . In addition, we showed that the conserved Cys52 of AdhR 
is essential for aldehyde sensing and activation of adhA-yraA  transcription in vivo . Thus, we 
speculate that redox regulation of  AdhR involves thiol-(S)-alkylat ion of this Cys52 residue by 
aldehydes as another novel mechan ism of bacterial physiology.

  Introduction 2 Thiol-specific stress response  
 INTRODUCTION 
1. The role of low molecular-weight thiols in the oxidative stress 
response 
Low molecular-weight (LMW) thiols play an essential role as a thiol redox buffer in 
the cell to maintain the reducing state of th e cytoplasm which is necessary for regular 
metabolic activities. Thus, these thiol buffers re present a major biological adaptation that is 
important for the survival of organisms unde r various endogenous and exogenous stresses. 
The simplest LMW thiol is hydrogen sulfide, pr imarily presents as a bound cofactor in iron-
sulfur proteins [Fahey, 2001]. The tripeptide γ-glutamylcysteinylglycin e, which is also known 
as glutathione (GSH) is the most dominant thiol predominantly found in eukaryotic cells 
[Meister and Anderson, 1983]. In addition to its key role in maintaining the proper oxidation 
state of protein thiols, GSH plays a critical ro le in protection against severe stresses. GSH 
protects against osmotic and acid stresses , toxic drugs like methylglyoxal, chlorine 
compounds like hypoclorous acid, and oxidative st ress such as hydrogen peroxide. GSH is 
also involved in the regulation of intracellular potassium levels and in preventing the 
formation of non-native protein disu lfides in the cytoplasm [Masip et al ., 2006]. In Gram-
negative bacteria, GSH has also been implicat ed in the growth of these organisms on 
recalcitrant nutrients by serving as a cofactor  for enzymes in various degradation pathways 
[Vuilleumier and Pagni, 2002]. Here, the role of GS H in protection against oxidative stress is 
discussed in more detail.  
Oxidative stress occurs when cells are exposed to elevated  levels of ROS such as 
hydrogen peroxides, alkyl hydroperoxides and hydroxyl radicals [Storz  and Imlay, 1999]. S-
thiolation is crucial for protection and regulation of thiol-containing proteins during oxidative 
stress and is frequently achieved by the formation of mixed disulfides with GSH. For 
example, the formation of mixed disulfides between target proteins and the LMW thiol GSH 
is a key event in the regulation of eukaryo tic proteins, including c-Jun, thioredoxin and 
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [Klatt et al ., 1999a; 1999b; Casagrande et al ., 
2002; Cotgreave et al ., 2002]. S-glutathionylation has also been reported to modulate the 
activity of E. coli  methionine synthase (MetE), phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase 
(CysH) and the oxidative stress-specific transcription fact or OxyR [Kim et al., 2002; Lillig et 
al., 2003; Hondorp and Matthews, 2004]. 
The Gram-positive model bacterium  B. subtilis  lacks detectable levels of GSH and the 
enzymes required for GSH synthesis [Fahey et al., 1978; Copley and Dhillon, 2002]. Thus, B. 
subtilis  produces different LMW thiols, such as  cysteine and CoASH, which appear to 
function in a similar way like GSH. In a previ ous thiol-redox proteomic analysis of Hochgräfe 
and coworkers (2005), it was reported that reversible thiol oxidation occurs in a number of B. 
subtilis  proteins in response to treatment with the thiol-reactive com pound diamide. Later on, Introduction 3 Thiol-specific stress response  
 Hochgräfe and coworkers (2007) showed that some  of these reversible thiol-modifications are 
mixed disulfides with the LMW thiol cysteine (S-cysteinylated proteins). Thus, S-thiolation 
represents a general mechanism to protect protein th iols from overoxidati on and irreversible 
damage in B. subtilis  and may play a role in redox regulation of  several thiol-containing 
proteins. Moreover, Lee et al.  (2007) demonstrated that the organic peroxide-sensing 
repressor OhrR of B. subtilis  is reversibly inactivated by S-thiolation with cysteine, coenzyme 
A (CoASH) and a novel 396 Da thio l under conditions of oxidative stress provoked by 
cumene hydroperoxides in vivo . The structure of this novel thio l is currently characterized and 
it seems to be an abundant LMW thiol consisting of cysteine, maleic acid and a sugar which is 
also present in Deinococcus  (John Helmann, personal communication). It was also shown that 
overoxidation of cysteine residues in the glyceral dehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to 
sulfonic acid caused by high level peroxide stress results in protein damage and in the 
irreversible loss of activity in B. subtilis  and Staphylococcus aureus [Weber et al ., 2004; 
Hochgräfe et al., 2005]. Such irreversible overoxidation of cysteine to sulfonic acid has been 
recently shown also as regulatory mechanism fo r OhrR in response to the strong oxidant 
linoleic acid [Soonsanga et al., 2008a]. Thus, dependi ng on the oxidant, Oh rR can be either 
reversibly oxidized or can instead function as a sacrificial regulator. 
2. Induction of the thiol-specifi c stress response by quinone-like 
electrophiles and diamide in B. subtilis  
The soil-dwelling bacterium B. subtilis  is exposed to different toxic, antibiotic and 
antimicrobial compounds which are produced in microbial communities, plants and fungi, or 
derived from environmental pollutants. The response of B. subtilis  to different classes of 
antibiotics was analyzed usi ng the 2D gel-based proteomic approach [Bandow and Hecker, 
2007]. However, there is very little knowledge regarding the response of B. subtilis  to 
aromatic antimicrobial compounds and whether B. subtilis  is able to detoxify aromatic 
compounds. Aromatic compounds originate from both natural and man-made sources, which 
are present in the environment [Smith, 1990]. Ar omatic compounds can have toxic effects or 
provide carbon sources for bacteria. Many of aromatic compounds are major environmental 
pollutants that must be removed as these of ten are toxic to cellular systems [Dagley, 1986]. 
Recently, using proteomic and transcriptomic a pproaches, the global expression profile of B. 
subtilis was monitored after exposure to phenol , salicylic acid, the fungal-related 
antimicrobial 6-brom-2-vinyl-chroman-4- on (chromanon), catechol and methylhydroquinone 
(MHQ) by Haike Antelmann´s group [Tam et al., 2006b; Duy et al., 2007a; 2007b]. These 
analyses revealed the inducti on of general and specific stre ss responses and uncovered novel 
complex thiol-stress responsive regu latory mechanisms that confer resistance to electrophiles.  
Phenol is a common environmental pollutant and chaotrope solute that causes water 
stress in Pseudomonas putida  [Hallsworth et al ., 2003]. The induction of  stress responsive Introduction 4 Thiol-specific stress response  
 proteins caused by aromatic phenolic compounds has been shown in Pseudomonas putida 
[Santos et al., 2004], Methylocystis  sp. [Uchiyama et al., 1999], Nocardioides  sp. [Cho et al., 
2000], Acinetobacter radioresistens [Giuffrida et al ., 2001], Acinetobacter calcoaceticus 
[Benndorf et al., 2001], Acinetobacter lwoffii  [Kim et al., 2004] and Stenotrophomonas  sp. 
[Ho et al ., 2004]. Phenol induced a classical heat-shock expression profile in B. subtilis  as 
revealed by the i nduction of the HrcA, σB and CtsR heat-shock re gulons. In addition, the 
activation of Spx dependent genes was shown by phenol that is induced under thiol-specific 
oxidative stress conditions such as diamide. Ho wever, whereas the diamide-induced stimulon 
also includes the oxidative st ress-specific PerR regulon, no oxidative stress response was 
observed in phenol-treated cell s. Finally, since phenol induced no further specific marker 
proteins besides the heat-shock proteomic signature, the mode of  action for phenol appears to 
be protein damage [Tam et al., 2006b]. 
Phenolic acids such as ferulic, p-coumaric and caffeic acids are present in plant-soil 
ecosystem. They can be considered as natura l toxins, which inhibit the growth and cause 
specific stress responses in microorganisms that  allow adaptation and confer resistance to 
these compounds [Clausen et al ., 1994; de Vries et al ., 1997; Lambert et al ., 1997]. For 
example, ferulic acid induces virulence gene expression in Agrobacterium tumefaciens  
[Kalogeraki et al ., 1999] and proton pumps are induced in response to cinnamic acid in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae  [Chambel et al., 1999]. However, phenolic acids can also serve as 
the sole carbon-energy source in  other bacteria such as Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter 
calcoaceticus [Lynd et al ., 2002]. In B. subtilis , salicylic acid, which is also present in the 
soil, caused predominan tly the induction of σB dependent general stress response, which is not 
related to the acidic conditions. In addition, both phenolic acid decarboxylase (Pad) systems 
(PadC and BsdBCD) which are involved in det oxification of phenolic aci ds confer resistance 
to salicylic acid [Duy et al., 2007a]. Finally, salicylic acid al so caused protein damage by non-
native disulfide formation as reflected by induc tion of the HrcA, CtsR  heat-shock regulons 
and the Spx thiol-stress regulon [Nakano et al., 2003b; Zuber, 2004; Duy et al., 2007a].  
Chromanon is derived from the natural antibiotic compounds aposphaerin A and B 
isolated from the fungus Aposphaeria  species, which showed significant activity against 
methicillin resistant Staphyloccocus aureus  strains [Albrecht et al ., 2005]. In B. subtilis , 
chromanon caused predominantly thiol-specific pr otein damage as indi cated by the induction 
of the HrcA, CtsR and Spx regulons [Duy et al ., 2007b]. However, the oxidative stress-
specific PerR regulon was not induced by chroma non, which indicates that the mode of action 
of chromanon differs also from that of diamid e. In addition, chroma non treatment resulted in 
a weak cell wall stress response, as reflected by  the induction of the ba citracin resistance gene 
bcrC  and the lia operon [Jordan et al ., 2007]. Interestingly, several oxidoreductases were 
strongly induced by chromanon which might conf er resistance to chromanon. For example, 
the ycnDE , ydgGH  and ydgIJ  operons encode NAD(P)H-flavin -dependent oxidoreductases, Introduction 5 Thiol-specific stress response  
 an antibiotic biosynthesis monooxygenase and MarR-type transcript ional regulators [Duy  et 
al., 2007b]. 
The most interesting expression profile  was observed for the phenolic compounds 
catechol and MHQ, which both induce different ring-cleavage enzymes as well as the thiol-
specific oxidative stress response in B. subtilis . Like diamide, catechol caused the common 
induction of the HrcA, CtsR, S px, CymR, PerR and Fur regulons which resemble the thiol-
specific oxidative stress signature. Diamide is a thiol-reactive oxidant that causes the 
formation of non-native disulfide bonds in cel lular thiol-containing proteins [Leichert et al., 
2003]. MHQ is the basic structure of the so-ca lled ganomycins, which were isolated from 
basidiomycete Ganoderma pfeifferi  and exhibited broad-spect rum antimicrobial activity 
[Mothana et al., 2000]. The expression profile of MHQ wa s also similar to that of diamide 
and catechol which indicates that these phenolic  compounds act like diamide as thiol-reactive 
compounds in B. subtilis  [Duy et al ., 2007b; Antelmann et al ., 2008]. Further evidence is 
presented that different extradiol dioxygenase s are specifically induced by catechol, MHQ 
and diamide exposure which are encoded by the genes yfiE, mhqA , mhqE  and mhqO  [Duy et 
al., 2007b]. The results presented in this thesis indicat e that these genes could encode novel 
thiol-dependent dioxygenases that are involved in the specific detoxification of quinone-like 
electrophiles, which deplet e the cellular thiol pool via the thiol-(S)-alkylation reaction 
[Liebeke et al., 2008]. Such quinones are produced upon au tooxidation of catechol and MHQ, 
which act as thiol-stress spec ific electrophiles. Thus, the induction of thiol-dependent 
dioxygenases is coupled to the thiol- specific oxidative stress response in B. subtilis .  
In conclusion, the transcriptome and proteo me results in res ponse to the phenolic 
compounds phenol, phenolic acid (salicylic acid) and chroma non indicated predominantly a 
heat shock-specific proteomic signa ture and protein damage [Tam et al., 2006b; Duy et al., 
2007a; 2007b]. In contrast, electr ophilic quinones deplete directly LMW thiol buffers as well 
as thiol-containing proteins via an alkylation mechanism, which results in a thiol-specific 
oxidative stress response in B. subtilis  [Tam et al ., 2006b; Duy et al ., 2007a; 2007b; 
Antelmann et al., 2008].  
3. Regulation of the thiol-specific stress response in B. subtilis  
Oxidative stress is generated by exposure to  elevated levels of ROS, such as 
superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide and th e highly toxic hydroxyl radical, which can 
damage proteins, nucleic acids and cell membranes [ Storz and Imlay, 1999]. Bacteria adapt to 
elevated levels of ROS by increasing the expres sion of defense and repair proteins, which is 
regulated by ROS responsive transcription factor s. Several regulatory f actors participate in 
controlling this complex thio l-specific stress response to  electrophilic compounds in B. 
subtilis , such as Spx, CtsR, PerR, CymR, and nove l MarR-type represso rs MhqR (YkvE) and Introduction 6 Thiol-specific stress response  
 YodB [Leichert et al ., 2003; Nakano et al ., 2003b; Zuber, 2004; Tam et al ., 2006b; 
Leelakriangsak et al., 2007; Töwe et al., 2007].  
  3.1. Spx-an activator of genes involved in the maintenance of the thiol-disulfide 
balance  
Spx was originally discovered as s uppressor of clpP and clpX mutations, formerly 
YjbD. Spx is one central regulator of the thiol-specific stress response in B. subtilis  which 
controls genes required for maintenance of the thiol-disulfide homeostasis. For example, Spx 
is required for the transcriptional activation of thioredoxin ( trxA) and thioredoxin reductase 
(trxB) genes in response to diamide stress [Nakano et al., 2003b; 2005; Zuber, 2004, Smits et 
al., 2005]. In addition to its role in the regulati on of the thiol-disulfide homeostasis, recent 
studies indicate that Spx functions as a regulator of gene expression in cells undergoing 
steady-state growth. Spx was found to negatively affect the transcription of genes that 
function in the utilization of organosulfur compounds as altern ative sources of sulfur [Erwin 
et al ., 2005]. Spx, an arsenate re ductase (ArsC) family prot ein, is highly conserved and 
involved either positively or negatively in variou s cellular functions in low-GC-content Gram-
positive bacteria [Nakano et al., 2001; 2002; Zuber, 2004; Chatterjee et al., 2006; Pamp et al., 
2006]. For example, Spx has also been implicated as a regulatory  factor for virulence-related 
functions in Staphylococcus aureus  [Pamp  et al ., 2006] and Listeria monocytogenes 
[Chatterjee et al., 2006].  
In B. subtilis , Spx concentration and activity increase when cells encounter thiol-
specific oxidative stress  conditions [Nakano et al ., 2003b; 2005]. Increases in Spx protein 
concentration are associated with a variety of  stress conditions including heat shock, salt, 
disulfide, oxidative stress and toxic aromatic compounds [Nakano et al., 2003b; Tam et al., 
2006a; 2006b; Duy et al., 2007a; 2007b]. The increase in Spx activity in cells encountering 
thiol-specific oxidative stress is due in part to a post-transcriptional mechanism of spx control 
resulting in an increase in Spx concentration [Nakano et al ., 2003b]. Regulation by Spx 
requires interaction with the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase α subunit [Nakano et 
al., 2003a; 2003b]. The spx gene resides in the yjbC-spx  dicistronic operon. Transcription of 
the yjbC-spx  operon is driven by five promoters, three (P 1, P2, and P B) reside upstream of yjbC 
and the P M and P 3 promoters are located in the yjbC -spx intergenic region. The control of spx 
expression in response to oxidative stress operates at several levels. Spx protein levels 
increase independently of spx transcriptional control by the downregulation of ATP-dependent 
ClpXP-catalyzed proteolysis [Nakano et al ., 2002, 2003a; 2003b; Zhang and Zuber, 2007]. 
Spx activity is under redox control through its CxxC disulfide center [Nakano et al., 2005]. In 
addition, transcription from the newly discovered P 3 promoter of spx is induced by thiol-
reactive agents [ Leelakriangsak and Zuber, 2007]. The P3 promoter was shown to depend on 
two transcriptional regulators that target the cis-acting negative control elements of the 
promoter, the peroxide regulon repressor PerR and the novel MarR-type/DUF24 family Introduction 7 Thiol-specific stress response  
 repressor YodB [Leelakriangsak et al ., 2007; Leelakriangsak and Zuber, 2007]. PerR was 
previously characterized as a repressor of the peroxide stre ss regulon [Herbig and Helmann, 
2001; Lee and Helmann, 2006a; 2006b]. YodB also  controls the dive rgently transcribed yodC  
gene, which encodes a nitroreduc tase and is induced in respons e to thiol-spec ific stress 
conditions [Duy et al ., 2007b; Leelakriangsak et al ., 2007]. YodB protects a region that 
includes the P 3 –10 and –35 regions, while PerR binds to a region downstream of the P 3 
transcriptional start site [Leelakriangsak et al., 2007].  The detailed regulatory mechanism of 
the YodB-repressor was studied  in collaboration with the group of Peter Zuber (Oregon), 
which was also a subject of this thesis. 
3.2. CymR-the repressor of the cy steine metabolism regulon  
The Cysteine metabolism repressor CymR is a master regul ator of sulfur metabolism. 
The CymR repressor exerts global control over a number of sulfur metabolism operons and is 
responsible for their repression when the preferred sulfur sources , sulfate and cysteine, are 
present. CymR appears as a repressor controlling several pathways leading to cysteine 
formation, including the O-acetylserine-thiol-lyase (CysK), L-cystine transporters (TcyP and 
TcyJKLMN), sulfonate assimilation (SsuABCD) and the methionine-to-cysteine conversion 
pathway (YrhA and YrhB). In addition, Cy mR represses the e xpression of the ytlI and ydbM 
genes, and the yxeK , ytmI, and yrrT operons. CymR binds to the promoter regions of these 
genes, except in the case of ytmI, which is indirectly controlled by CymR via YtlI. O-
acetylserine or its spontaneous derivative N-acetylserine modulates CymR dependent binding 
[Even et al., 2006]. Considering the set of  controlled genes, the CymR repressor can be seen 
as a functional equivalent of th e LysR-type activator CysB from E. coli  [Kredich, 1992].  
Previous studies have es tablished the link between sulfur metabolism and oxidative 
stress [Leichert et al., 2003; Mostertz et al., 2004; Smits et al., 2005]. A higher expression of 
several genes involved in sulfur metabolism is observed in a strain depleted of thioredoxin A 
[Smits et al., 2005; Mostertz et al., 2008] and in response to superoxide and disulfide stresses 
[Leichert et al., 2003; Mostertz et al., 2004]. In particular, most of the cysteine biosynthesis 
genes repressed by CymR are induced under these conditions. Cysteine itself has been 
proposed to be involved in the oxidative stress response in Staphylococcus aureus  [Lithgow et 
al., 2004] and B. subtilis  [Duy et al., 2007b]. Free cysteine serves as LMW thiol in B. subtilis  
and protects protein thiols against irreversible overoxidations, which was shown by the 
identification of S-cysteinylated proteins in response to diamide treatment [Hochgräfe et al., 
2007]. Thus, the derepression of the CymR regulated genes involve d in cysteine biosynthesis 
in response to oxidative is caused by th e depletion of the LMW thiol cysteine resulting in an 
imbalanced thiol-redox state of the cell. As shown recently using metabolomic approaches, 
cysteine is also depleted after treatment with quinones which is based on the thiol-(S)-
alkylation reaction [Liebeke et al ., 2008]. Moreover, it could be shown that toxic Introduction 8 Thiol-specific stress response  
 concentrations of quinones depl ete also thiol-contai ning proteins due to  the formation of 
irreversibly damaged quinone-protein-aggregat es, which are not accessible for the 2D gel 
separation.    
  3.3. HrcA and CtsR-heat-shock-specific regulators  
The adaptation to heat stress is on e of the best-characterized physical stress responses 
of mesophilic bacteria. In B. subtilis , the heat shock respon se is governed by HrcA, σB, and 
CtsR [Hecker and Völker, 2001; Helmann et al., 2001]. Of these, the HrcA and CtsR regulons 
are also induced under thiol-stre ss specific stress conditions [Tam et al., 2006b; Duy et al., 
2007a; 2007b; Antelmann et al ., 2008]. The HrcA protein is a transcriptional repressor of 
class I heat shock genes and regulates the expression of two operons, the complex dnaK  
operon as well as the groEL-groES  operon [Schmidt  et al., 1992; Homuth et al., 1997]. This 
repressor binds to conserved cis-acting regulatory sequence s known as CIRCE (C ontrolling 
Inverted R epeat of C haperone E xpression) elements [ Zuber and Schumann, 1994] and 
responds specifically to heat induction. The CtsR ( Class three stress gene repressor) repressor 
negatively regulates the expression of class III heat shock genes ( clpP, clpE and the clpC  
operon) by binding to a direc tly repeated heptanucleotide operator sequence [Helmann et al., 
2001; Miethke et al ., 2006]. The clp genes encode ATPase subunits (ClpA, ClpB, ClpC, 
ClpE, ClpX) and a proteolytic subunit, ClpP. ATPase subunits can act alone as molecular 
chaperones [ Wawrzynow et al., 1996] but also associate with the ClpP proteo lytic subunit to 
form an ATP-dependent protease whose substr ate specificity is conferred by the ATPase 
[Gottesman et al., 1997]. The ClpP protea se was shown to act in  global protein quality 
control. ClpP is involved in development of competence, motility, thermotolerance, 
degradative enzyme synthesis and sporulation [Kock et al., 2004]. The ClpC ATPase is the 
interacting partner of ClpP in many physiologically important processes such as competence 
gene expression or adaptation to diverse stress conditions [Krüger et al ., 1994]. While the 
importance of ClpC and ClpP has been elucidated for a wide range of cellular adaptation 
processes, ClpE is essential both for efficient CtsR dependent gene derepression and for 
derepression during heat stress [Miethke et al ., 2006]. Regulation of CtsR activity is 
controlled by a fine-tuned phosphorylation mechanism including the modulators McsB and 
McsA [Kirstein et al ., 2005]. The HrcA and CtsR regulons were also strongly induced by 
phenol, chromanon, catechol and MHQ which i ndicates protein damage by these compounds 
[Tam et al., 2006b; Duy et al., 2007b].  
3.4. PerR-the main regulator of the oxidative stress response  
In B. subtilis , protection against oxidative stress is primarily  mediated by the induction 
of oxidative stress-specific pr oteins, which are contro lled by the repressor protein PerR [Chen 
et al., 1995a; Bsat et al., 1998]. The metalloprotein PerR was identified in the John Helmann's 
laboratory as a member of the Fur family of metal-dependent regulators [Fuangthong and Introduction 9 Thiol-specific stress response  
 Helmann, 2003]. PerR is the major regulator  of the peroxide stress response. In B. subtilis , 
PerR is a dimeric, Zn2+-containing metalloprotei n with a regulatory metal-binding site that 
binds Fe2+ (PerR:Zn,Fe) or Mn2+ (PerR:Zn,Mn) [Lee and Helmann, 2006b]. PerR and PerR-
like regulators have been iden tified in many bacteria including Campylobacter jejuni [van 
Vliet et al., 1999], Streptomyces reticuli [Ortiz de Orué Lucana and Schrempf, 2000], 
Streptomyces coelicolor [Hahn et al., 2000], Streptococcus pyogenes [King et al., 2000], 
Staphylococcus aureus  [Horsburgh et al., 2001] and Borrelia burgdorferi  [Boylan et al., 
2003].  
Cells respond to ROS by the induction of a variety of protecti ve enzymes and proteins. 
For example, superoxide anions are converted to H 2O2 and O 2 by superoxide dismutase, 
whereas catalase, GSH peroxida ses and peroxiredoxins reduce a nd detoxify peroxides. Thiol-
disulfide reductases (thioredoxi n and glutaredoxin) reduce disulf ide bonds within proteins and 
oxidized LMW thiols. Molecular chaperones are stimulated to mediate the refolding of 
unfolded and aggregated proteins  [Barford, 2004]. Most peroxide regulators (e.g. OxyR and 
Hsp33) are redox-controlled and us e reactive cysteines to sense peroxides which often lead to 
the formation of either intra- or intermolecular disulfides [Paget and Buttner, 2003; Kiley and 
Storz, 2004]. The redox-sensitiv e transcription factor of E. coli  OxyR mediates the cellular 
response to both ROS and reactive nitrogen sp ecies (RNS) by controlling the expression of 
the OxyR regulon, which encodes proteins involved in peroxide metabolism and in 
maintenance of the thiol redox balance of the cell [Paget and Buttner, 2003]. Redox-reactive 
cysteine residues in OxyR are required for th e reversible induction of gene expression by 
ROS [Storz et al ., 1990a]. Cys199 and Cys208 both were strongly implicated in the ROS 
response and Cys199 serves as the specifi c redox sensor of ROS and RNS [Kullik et al ., 
1995; Barford, 2004]. The E. coli  Hsp33 responds to oxidative stress with the rapid activation 
of its chaperone function [Jakob et al ., 1999]. The redox-sensitive cysteine residues are 
located within a C-terminal cysteine cluster that forms a high-affinity Zn2+-binding motif. The 
four cysteines of this motif are structurally invariant and are maintained as thiolate species by 
coordinating Zn2+ with high affinity [Jakob et al ., 2000]. Under oxidizing conditions, the 
cysteine cluster releases Zn2+ and two intramolecular disulfide bonds are formed, with 
concomitant dimerization of oxi dized Hsp33 monomers [Graumann et al., 2001]. 
In contrast, PerR does not appear to use thiol disulfide chemistry to sense ROS despite 
the presence of four conserved cysteine residues in the Zn2+-binding domain [Lee and 
Helmann, 2006b]. The Helmann group showed that PerR senses H 2O2 by metal-catalyzed 
histidine oxidation. PerR oxidation, medi ated by a bound ferrous ion, leads to the 
incorporation of one oxygen atom into His-37 or  His-91, two of the resi dues that are supposed 
to co-ordinate the bound Fe2+. This oxidation would lead to iron release and dissociation of 
the PerR-DNA adduct. The proposed mechanism relies on the reduction of H 2O2 by Fe2+ and 
the generation of highly reactive hydroxyl radi cals (Fenton reaction). By analogy to metal-Introduction 10 Thiol-specific stress response  
 catalyzed oxidative reactions with histid ine-containing enzymes and model peptides 
[Schoneich, 2000], it was shown that the hydroxyl ra dical reacts with his tidine and generates 
the 2-oxo-histidinyl radical intermediate, which finally leads to the 2- oxo-histidine. However, 
PerR responds also to thio l-specific stress conditions such  as diamide and quinone-like 
electrophiles, which deplete protein thiols. Th us, there could be a different mechanism of 
PerR to sense electrophilic compounds, whic h most probably involve s the conserved Cys 
residues in the Zn2+-binding domain. 
 3.5. The MarR-type regulators  
In addition to the above mentioned th iol-stress-specific re gulons, the recently 
identified thiol-stress-responsive Ma rR-type repressors YodB and MhqR 
(Methyl hydroquinone specific repressor, formerly YkvE) were characterized in B. subtilis  in 
this study [Leelakriangsak et al ., 2007; 2008; Töwe et al ., 2007]. Both YodB and MhqR 
regulons are induced under thiol-stress cond itions and confer resistance to quinone 
electrophiles by the control of paralogous de toxification enzymes consisting of quinone 
reductases and thiol-depe ndent dioxygenases [Tam et al ., 2006b; Duy et al ., 2007b; 
Leelakriangsak et al., 2008; Antelmann et al., 2008]. The YodB repres sor negatively controls 
Spx, the nitroreductase YodC and a FMN-de pendent NADH-azoreductase  AzoR1 in response 
to thiol-stress condition [Duy et al ., 2007b; Leelakriangsak et al ., 2007; 2008]. The MhqR 
repressor negatively controls three thiol-de pendent dioxygenases (MhqA, MhqO and MhqE), 
the nitroreductase MhqN and the azoreductase YvaB (AzoR2) in response to the thiol-reactive 
electrophiles quinone and diamide [Töwe et al., 2007]. 
Both YodB and MhqR regulators are member s of the MarR family of winged-helix 
transcription factors that regulate a vari ety of biological functions in bacteria [Wilkinson and 
Grove, 2006]. MarR family proteins regulate th e expression of resistance genes to multiple 
antibiotics, aromatic compounds, organic solvents, or oxidative stress agents. Most of these 
MarR family members are repressors of ge ne expression [Tropel and van der Meer, 2004]. 
However, in Rhodopseudomonas  the MarR type regulator BadR was shown to active 
transcription of the benzoate degrada tion pathway [Egland and Harwood, 1999]. In B. subtilis , 
the most-studied MarR family repressor is th e organic hydroperoxide resistance repressor 
OhrR that represses ohrA  by binding to a 15 bp inverted re peat overlapping the promoter 
region [Fuangthong et al., 2001; Fuangthong and Helmann, 2002; Hong et al., 2005]. Recent 
studies have shown that a complex thiolate swit ch regulates OhrR activity in the presence of 
organic hydroperoxides. Inactivat ion of OhrR requires Cys15 oxi dation, which leads to either 
a sulfenamide or a mixed disulfide (S-thiolated ) form of OhrR in the presence of cumene 
hydroperoxide [Lee et al., 2007]. In addition, overoxidation of Cys15 to sulfonic acid leads to 
relief of OhrR-mediated repression in the presence of the strong oxidant linoleic acid 
[Soonsanga et al., 2008a]. Introduction 11 Thiol-specific stress response  
 YodB is highly conserved among low GC Gram-positive bacteria, and there are at 
several YodB paralogs in the genome of B. subtilis . YodB-like regulators share the conserved 
N-terminal cysteine in position 5 or 6 follo wed by a conserved proline residue. The YodB 
protein contains three cysteine residues,  at position 6 (C6), 101 (C101) and 108 (C108). 
Unlike the two C-terminal Cys residues, C6 is conserved among YodB homologues in low 
GC Gram-positive bacteria. Cys residues have been  shown to be involved in the redox-control 
of other oxidative stress transcription factors, such as OxyR, Hsp33 of E. coli  and OhrR of B. 
subtilis  [Graumann et al ., 2001; Hong et al ., 2005; Nakano et al ., 2005; Lee et al ., 2007]. 
Cysteine residues are strong nucleophiles, which are shown to be conjugated with 
electrophilic compounds such as p-benzoquinone and hydroquinones to form thiol-S-adducts 
[Giles et al., 2003; Dennehy et al., 2006]. One cysteine residue is present in MhqR (C128), 
which is located in the dimerization domain and accessible for thiol-modification according to 
published structure for B. subtilis OhrR and E. coli  MarR [Alekshun et al., 2001; Hong et al., 
2005]. In this study, it was shown in collabora tion with the group of Peter Zuber that the 
conserved Cys6 residue of YodB is requi red for optimal YodB-mediated repression in vivo  
and in vitro  [Leelakriangsak et al., 2008]. In addition, our studies with the YodB-paralogous 
YvaP-repressor showed that Cys7 is also the sensing cysteine residue and required for 
repression of the catDE  operon. Mass spectrometry analyses identified the formation of Cys6-
S-adducts upon treatment of YodB with the thio l-reactive compounds MHQ and catechol in 
vitro  leading to the loss of DNA binding activity of YodB [Leelakriangsak et al., 2008]. Thus, 
YodB and YvaP are both directly  sensing thiol-reactive compounds via the conserved C6 and 
Cys7 residues, since DNA binding activity is  directly inhibited by the thiol-reactive 
compounds MHQ and diamide in vitro . The reactivity of the cysteines is determined by 
neighboring basic amino acids which lower the cyst eine pKa to generate the reactive cysteine 
thiolate anion. Stabilization of the active site thiolate anion by neighboring basic amino acids 
has been shown for the oxidative st ress responsive regulators OxyR of E. coli  and OhrR of B. 
subtilis  [Choi et al., 2001; Soonsanga et al., 2007]. Moreover, it has been shown also that the 
thiol-(S)-alkylation reaction via the Michael addition chemistry is favored by adjacent 
arginine and lysine residues [Dennehy et al., 2006]. In the present study, the basic K19 and 
R20 amino acid residues are also essential for YvaP repression in vivo . 
4. The response of bacteria to  the electrophile methylglyoxal  (MG)  
Another objective of this thesis was further to investigate the gl obal expression profile 
of B. subtilis  in response to natural occurring electrophiles. Thus, we have selected 
methylglyoxal (MG) since this is  as one of the best studied natural electrophiles in enteric 
bacteria. MG is also refe rred as pyruvaldehyde, pyruvic  aldehyde, 2-oxopropanal, 2-
ketoproprion-aldehyde a nd acetyl-formaldehyde, which is a yellow liquid [Kalapos, 1999]. 
MG is a naturally occurring toxi c electrophile that at high concen trations can cause cell death. 
MG is produced in all cells, not just  bacteria, by different mechanisms ( Fig. 1.1) when an Introduction 12 Thiol-specific stress response  
 imbalance occurs in the metabolism [ Murata et al., 1989; Kalapos, 1999; Booth et al., 2003].  
MG, a glycolytic intermediate, is produced  from triose-phosphate  intermediates of 
phosphorylating glycolysis [Phillips and Thor nalley, 1993]. MG is also formed by lipid 
peroxidation systems [Poli  et al ., 1985], in the metabolism of acetone [Reichard et al., 1986] 
and aminoacetone [Lyles and Chalmers, 1992], and during the degradatio n of DNA [Chaplen 
et al., 1996]. In addition, MG is ubiquitous in beverages and foods, such as coffee and soy 
sauce [Kasai et al., 1982; Nagao et al., 1986]. MG synthesis is mediated by enzymes including 
MG synthase, cytochrome P450 and amine oxidase, which are involved in glycolytic bypass, 
acetone metabolism and amino acid breakdown, re spectively [Kalapos, 1999]. In eukaryotic 
cells, MG is also generated by nonenzymatic fragmentation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate or 
glyceraldehyde 3-phophate [Phillips and Thornalley, 1993].

are not shown in the flow-chart. Dotted lines represent the ways of non-enzymatic methylglyoxal formation. This 
figure was adapted from Kalapos, 1999. 
The role of MG in cell physiology has been studied since many years. Although 
known as growth regulator [ Együd and Szent-Györgyi, 1966] and to act as a bypass pathway 
for glycolysis [ Hopper and Cooper, 1971], MG is a very toxic compound. It can react with the 
nucleophilic centers of macromolecules such as DNA and RNA. Moreover, MG inhibits 
growth by interfering with protein synt hesis and consequently prevents initiation of DNA 
replication [Fraval and McBrien, 1980; Lo et al., 1994].  In addition, MG can exert cytotoxic, Introduction 13 Thiol-specific stress response  
 cytostatic and mutagenic effect s in cells [Inoue and Kimura,  1995; Thornalley, 1996; Kalapos, 
1999; Booth et al., 2003].  
Furthermore, MG modifies irreve rsibly amino acids in proteins [Lo et al., 1994]. It has 
been reported that MG binds and modifies a number of proteins, including numerous intra- 
and extra-cellular membrane proteins [Shipanova et al., 1997]. Proteins th at are shown to be 
modified by MG are collagen [Bow es and Cater, 1968], ribonuclease [Brock et al ., 2007], 
lysozyme [Kato et al., 1986], bovine serum albumin [Westwood et al., 1994], heat and shock 
protein 27 (Hsp27) [Sakamoto et al ., 2002]. MG modifies proteins through the Maillard 
reaction, resulting in several characteristic adva nced glycation, glycoxidation and lipoxidation 
end products (AGE/ALEs) which can alter protei n structure and functions. MG reacts readily 
with the basic amino acid side chains of arginine and lysine residues [Gomes et al ., 2006; 
Brock et al., 2007]. MG primarily reacts with arginine residues ( via guanidino group) to form 
Nδ-(5-methyl-4-imidazolon-2-yl)-L-o rnithine (5-methylimidazolone) and Nδ-(5-hydro-5-
methyl-4-imidazolon-2-yl)-L-ornithi ne (5-hydro-5-methylimidazolone) [Thornalley, 1996; 
Uchida et al ., 1997; Westwood et al ., 1997]. MG reacts with  lysine residues ( via e-amino 
group) to generate an MG-derived lysine-lysine cross-link (imidazolysine) and Nε-
carboxyethyllysine (CEL) [Nagaraj et al., 1996; Uchida  et al ., 1997; Westwood  et al ., 1997]. 
MG also reacts with the nucle ophilic thiol group of cysteine to form hemithioacetal 
[Thornalley, 1996]. MG modification of proteins and amino acids causes cell damage and is 
the cause of cellular toxi city [Thornalley, 1996; Oya et al., 1999]. Hipkiss and Chana (1998) 
showed that carnosine can protect proteins ag ainst MG toxicity. Carn osine detoxifies MG 
thereby inhibiting MG-media ted protein modification.  
Because of the cytotoxicity  of MG, both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells have evolved 
specific detoxification systems and pr otective mechanisms [Thornalley, 1996;  Kalapos,  1999; 
Booth et al., 2003]. There are two lines of protection from  MG toxicity [Kalapos, 1999]. The 
direct mechanism operates through the glyoxalas e system thus detoxifying the electrophile, 
while an indirect mechanism is also operati ve by the acidification of the cytoplasm [ Ferguson 
et al., 1995]. In the majority of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, the major mechanisms for 
detoxifying MG is the GSH-depe ndent glyoxalase I-II system ( Fig. 1.2), a ubiquitous thiol-
dependent detoxification pathway wi th D-lactate as the final product [Thornalley, 1990; 1996; 
2003; Inoue and Kimura, 1995; Kalapos, 1999]. The glyoxalase system consists of two 
ubiquitous metalloenzymes and requires catalytic amounts of reduced GSH [ Racker, 1951]. 
The metalloenzymes glyoxalase I (S-lactoylglut athione MG lyase) and glyoxalase II (S-2-
hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase) catalyze the step-wise dismutation of MG into the 
corresponding 2-hydroxyacids (D-lactate), us ing GSH as a cofactor [Thornalley, 1990]. 
Glyoxalase I acts on the adduct of MG and GSH, thus catalyzing the substrate isomeration of 
hemithioacetal into S-D-lactoylglutathione [ Mannervik and Ridderström, 1993]. 
Subsequently, glyoxalase II converts S-D-la ctoylglutathione into D-lactate and GSH [ Vander Introduction 14 Thiol-specific stress response  
 Jagt, 1993]. Glyoxalase I and II possess mononuclear and binuclear active sites, respectively. 
These glyoxalase enzymes have been characteri zed from bacteria to man, revealing largely 
conserved enzymological and structural characteristics [Thornalley, 2003]. To date, 
glyoxalase I can be roughly sub-divided into two different groups according to the type of 
divalent cation bound at the activ e site [Clugston et al., 1998; Sukdeo et al., 2004]. The first 
class is Zn2+-dependent and is composed of glyoxalase  I from mainly eukaryotic organisms. 
For example, glyoxalase I from human and yeast [Aronsson et al ., 1978] and Plasmodium 
falciparum  [Iozef et al ., 2003] prefers Zn2+. The second class is composed of non-Zn2+-
dependent (but Ni2+ or Co2+-dependent) glyoxalase I enzy mes (mainly prokaryotic and 
leishmanial species). For example, glyoxala se I from several bacteria such as E. coli  
[Clugston et al., 1998], Yersinia pestis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa  and Neisseria meningitidis 
[Sukdeo et al., 2004] and from the protozoan parasite Leishmania major  [Ariza et al., 2005] is 
optimally activated in the presence of Ni2+. Glyoxalase II is typically Zn2+-activated, 
containing Zn2+ and either Fe3+/Fe2+ or Mn2+ at the active site depending on the biological 
source [O’Young et al., 2007]. In addition, some organisms use another LMW thiol instead of 
GSH. For example, in the trypanosomatid parasite Leishmania major , trypanothione replaces 
GSH in the defense against ce llular damage caused by MG [ Fairlamb et al., 1985]. In this 
protozoon , the first step in MG detoxification is performed by a trypanothione-dependent 
glyoxalase I containing a Ni2+ cofactor [Ariza et al., 2006]. 
 
Fig. 1.2. MG detoxification via the glyoxalase system.  MG reacts spontaneously with GSH to form 
hemithiolacetal, followed by isomeri zation to S-D-lactoylglu tathione by the glyoxalase I enzyme. S-D-
lactoylglutathione is substrate for glyoxalase II enzyme which is conver ted to D-lactate and free GSH. This 
figure is adapted from Sukdeo  et al. (2004). Introduction 15 Thiol-specific stress response  
 Besides the GSH-dependent glyoxalase syst em, there are GSH-independent pathways 
for MG detoxification [ Misra et al ., 1995; 1996]. The glyoxalase III catalyses the GSH-
independent conversion of MG into D-lactate in E. coli  [Misra et al., 1995]. Secondly, the 
MG reductases convert MG into lactaldehyde [Murata et al., 1989]. Such aldose and aldehyde 
reductases, mediating the reduction of MG to acetol and D-lactaldehyde have been reported 
for E. coli , Saccharomyces cerevisiae , plants and mammals [Inoue  and Kimura, 1995; Misra 
et al., 1996]. Important enzymes for reduction of MG are aldo-keto reductases (AKRs), which 
catalyze the formation of acetol from MG in the presence of NADPH [Kalapos, 1999]. AKRs 
are a large superfamily of rela ted proteins that catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of 
various aldehydes and ketones [Jez and Penning, 2001; Ellis,  2002]. The AKR superfamily 
consists of 14 families, based on their structures and sequences [Jez and Penning, 2001]. 
Although a detailed mechanism has been revealed for some of the AKRs, the physiological 
function of most putative members of this superfamily is still unclear. This is based in part on 
their broad substrate specificity and also because of the difficulty of genetic analysis, as many 
organisms have multiple genes that encode AKRs. For example, E. coli  has six AKR genes 
and yeast has 14 [Goffeau et al., 1996; Blattner et al. , 1997]. The number of AKR genes in 
cyanobacteria varies greatly. Synechocystis  sp. PCC 6803, Synechococcus sp. PCC 6301 and 
Nostoc punctiforme  have four, two and 21 potential AKR genes, respectively. There are four 
potential AKR genes in Synechococcus  sp. PCC 7002, based on its genomic sequence [Xu et 
al., 2006]. Although some mammalian and eukaryotic AKRs have been characterized, only 
for a small subset of bacterial AKRs substrate specificities have been analyzed [Ellis, 2002]. 
For example, Ko et al.  (2005) recently showed th at AKR plays an important role in vivo  in 
MG detoxification in E. coli . YafB and YqhE have been char acterized as 2,5-diketo-gluconate 
(2,5-DKG) reductases, while E. coli  YghZ has been shown to reduce MG and enhance MG 
resistance when the gene is overproduced. Furthermore, the α-oxoaldehyde dehydrogenase (2-
oxoaldehyde:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase) is another enzyme involved in MG degradation [ Inoue 
and Kimura, 1995]. 
To date, survival strategies in response  to MG challenge is best understood in E. coli  
which is explained now in more de tail. To ensure its survival, the E. coli  cell has developed 
severe protective mechanisms against electrophiles. In E. coli , the GSH-based detoxification 
pathway is central to survival against MG t oxicity. There are at least two levels of GSH-
dependent protection against MG: the activation of GSH-gated K+ channels and the 
detoxification by reaction of MG with GSH, foll owed by the action of glyoxalase I and II to 
produce D-lactate and free GSH. These two m echanisms are linked, as the product of 
glyoxalase I (S-lactoylglutathione) is the ma jor activator of the KefB/KefC system [ MacLean 
et al., 1998]. The activation of the KefB/KefC system results in the rapid loss of potassium 
from the cell accompanied by a decrease in the intrace llular pH (pHi) [Ferguson et al., 1995; 
Ferguson and Booth, 1998]. The decrease in the pHi protects E. coli  cells against the toxic 
effects of MG. The integration of the glyoxalase syst em with activation of KefB means that Introduction 16 Thiol-specific stress response  
 the cell has a “detoxification mete r”-the glyoxalase I enzyme ge nerates the activator of the 
KefB/KefC system and removes its inhibitor, and the glyoxalase II enzyme removes the 
activator and regenerates the inhibitor. Thus, the pH of the cell during exposure to MG 
accurately reflects the balance of exposure to  MG and the rate of detoxification [Booth et al., 
2003].  
In contrast to Gram-negative bacteria, litt le is known about the mechanisms of MG 
detoxification in Gram-positive bacteria. B. subtilis  and other Gram-positive bacteria lack 
GSH as their major LMW thiol and KefB/KefC activities which ha ve been shown to protect 
E. coli  against MG toxicity [Ferguson et al ., 1995]. Bacillus stearothermophilus  possesses 
MG synthase and appears to have evolved or acquire d the glyoxalase I-II pathways [Burke 
and Tempest, 1990]. Enzymes with homologies to glyoxalases are encoded also in the 
genome of B. subtilis , but the physiological importance is still unknown. Thus, the MG-
protective mechanisms remain to be identified in B. subtilis  [Ferguson et al ., 1998].  
However, our transcriptome results in res ponse to quinone-like electrophiles, MG and 
diamide suggest that metal ion efflux systems (e .g. ArsR, CsoR) could play  a role in extrusion 
of electrophiles in B. subtilis  since these are strongly derepressed under thiol-stress conditions 
provoked by electrophiles [Antelmann et al., 2008]. These could play  similar roles as the E. 
coli KefB/KefC systems in protection against MG toxicity in B. subtilis . 
Recently, the role of free radicals in the biochemistry of MG receives attention. The 
possible involvement of free radicals in react ions between MG and macromolecules was 
raised by Szent-Györgyi (1968), especially the interaction be tween protein amines and MG 
[Kon and Szent-Györgyi, 1973]. MG leads also  to production of RNS and organic radicals 
such as MG radical or cross- linked protein radical which caus es protein damage [Kalapos, 
2008].  
5. The response of bacteria to the  electrophile formaldehyde (FA) 
Since commercially available MG is often contaminated with up to 30% formaldehyde 
(FA), we studied also the response of B. subtilis  to FA as another example for reactive 
aldehydes. Reduced one-carbon (C 1) compounds, such as methane, methanol and FA, are 
ubiquitously present in the natural environment. C 1 microorganisms, including 
methanotrophic and methylotrophic bacteria, possess metabolic pathways for detoxification 
and fixation of these C1-compounds. Because FA is  located at the branch point between the 
assimilation and dissimilation pathways during C 1 metabolism in these organisms [ Anthony, 
1982], it is the key intermediate in the metabolism of C 1 compounds. FA is produced from 
methanol by NAD-dependent methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) in the first stage of the 
utilization of carbon and ener gy sources by methylotrophs. Besides the methanol oxidation 
pathway, FA is also synthesized from methylamine in several species of methylotrophs, which 
are able to utilize methylamine as the sole source of carbon and energy [Kelly et al., 1993]. In Introduction 17 Thiol-specific stress response  
 other organisms, FA is produced through the degradation of organi c compounds that have 
methyl or methoxyl groups , e.g. lignin, pectin, etc.  [Yurimoto et al ., 2005]. FA is a 
subproduct in the metabolism of histidine, c holine and of a number of plant-derived 
methoxylated aromatic chemicals such as va nillate, veratrate and caffeate in certain 
microorganisms [Mitsui et al ., 2000]. FA has also been found as a subproduct of the 
metabolism of certain xenobiotic  compounds such as the expl osive hexahydro-1,3-5-trinitro-
1,3,5-triaine (RDX),  glyphosate (N -phosphonomethylglycine), atropine and methenamine, a 
compound used to treat urnary track infections  [Musher and Griffith, 1974; Shinabarger and 
Braymer, 1986; Long et al., 1997; Fournier et al., 2004]. 
FA is also an important di sinfectant in holding-tank sewage s, particularly at alkaline 
pHs [Sobsey et al ., 1974] and is widely used to sterilize labor atory rooms and working 
surfaces [Taylor et al ., 1969]. In addition, FA is widely employed in the biochemistry, 
biomedicine and pharmacy. In particular , FA is used for isotope-labeling of proteins [Jentoft 
and Dearborn, 1983]. Most importantly, FA is us ed as cross-linker in the study of protein-
protein or protein-DNA interactions [Kunkel et al ., 1981]. FA can inactivate, stabilize or 
immobilize DNA and proteins. FA r eacts with the amino group of the N-terminal amino acid 
residue and the side-chains of arginine, cysteine, histidine, tyrosine, tryptophan, asparagine, 
glutamine and lysine ( Fig. 1.3) [Orlando et al., 1997; Metz et al., 2004]. FA treatment results 
in a large variety of chemical modifications in  proteins, such as the formation of methylol 
groups, Schiff’s bases and methylene br idges. However, the formation of modifications 
depends on various factors, such as the rate of a particular cro ss-link reaction, the position and 
local environment of each reactive amino acid in the protein, the pH, the components present 
in the reaction solution and the reactant concentrations. The c onversion of peptides after FA 
treatment might predict the reaction rate  of FA-induced intramolecular cross-links. Especially, 
intramolecular cross-links in proteins are initiated by the reaction of FA with lysine residues 
[Metz et al., 2004].  
FA is a highly reactive chemical that exerts toxic effect in all organisms from bacteria 
to humans, due to its nonspecific reactivity with biological macromolecules such as DNA and 
protein [Feldman,  1973; Vorholt et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2006].  Early studies by Neely (1963a; 
1963b; 1963c) revealed that FA has bacteriostatic activity at sublethal c oncentrations due to 
its ability to disrupt growth and interfer e with methionine biosynthesis. At higher 
concentrations, FA is a potent antimicrobial agent and has been used to inactivate Bacillus 
anthracis  and B. subtilis  spores [Manchee et al., 1994; Sagripanti and Bonifacino, 1996]. 
Since FA is toxic in all organisms, differe nt mechanisms have evolved to counteract 
its toxicity. These mechanisms involve fixati on through a number of metabolic pathways and 
detoxification via oxidation to formate and CO 2. Four different pathways for FA Introduction 18 Thiol-specific stress response  
 detoxification are known in bacteria, encoded by unrelated or distantly related genes, which 
will be briefly described in the following part. 
 
Fig. 1.3. Chemical cross-linking  of DNA and proteins by FA.  FA is a very reactive dipolar compound in 
which the carbon atom is the nucleophilic centre. Amino and imino groups of proteins (e.g., the side chains of 
lysine and arginine) and of nucleic acids (e.g., cytosine) react with FA, leading to the formation of a Schiff’s 
base (reaction I). This intermediate can react with  a second amino group (reac tion II) and condenses. (a) FA 
mediated cross-linking between the side chains of two lysines. (b) Cross-linking between cytosine and lysine.

The best characterized FA detoxifica tion pathway is the GSH-dependent NADH-
linked FA dehydrogenase (GSH-FDH) and formyl-GSH hydrolase (FGH) which are found in 
both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, such as Burkholderia  fungorum  (Fig. 1.4) [Harms et al ., 
1996; Lee et al., 2002; Sanghani et al., 2002a; 2002b;  Tanaka et al., 2002; Marx et al., 2004]. 
These enzymes belong to the zinc-containing medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) 
family [Persson et al ., 1991]. Some FDHs that do not require GSH for activity have been 
characterized in Pseudomonas putida  and Burkholderia  fungorum  [Tanaka et al., 2002; Marx 
et al., 2004].  Introduction 19 Thiol-specific stress response

Fhc, formyltransferase-hydrolase complex.  This figure is adapted from Marx et al. (2004). 
Another important pathway for FA detoxification is the ribulose monophosphate 
(RuMP) pathway. This pathway is present in many methylotrophs, which can utilize C 1 
compounds as a sole source of carbon and energy [Hanson and Hanson, 1996]. This pathway 
is present also in a number of  bacterial and archaeal strains [ Yanase et al., 1996; Mitsui et al., 
2000; Vorholt et al., 2000; Yurimoto et al., 2002; Kato et al., 2006]. The RuMP pathway is 
responsible for the detoxification of FA in the non-methylotrophic B. subtilis  [Yasueda et al., 
1999; Yurimoto et al., 2005] and Burkholderia cepacia  [Mitsui et al. 2003]. Reactions of the 
RuMP pathway are shown in Fig. 1.5 which can be divided into three phases. The FA fixation 
phase involves two reactions that are unique to the RuMP pathway: the condensation of FA 
with ribulose 5-phosphate and the subsequent isomerization of the product, D- arabino -3-
hexulose 6-phosphate, to yield fructose 6-phosphate. These reacti ons are catalyzed by 3-
hexulose-6-phosphate synthase (HPS) and 6- phospho-3-hexuloisomeras e (PHI), respectively. 
The second phase involves cleav age of the hexose phosphate to form two triose phosphates; 
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) enters the third phase of FA fi xation, which consists of 
rearrangement reactions, while dihydroxyacetone  phosphate (DHAP) enters the central 
pathway for synthesis of cell co nstituents. The third phase is the rearrangement phase, which 
includes the reactions that are necessary to regenerate the accepto r of FA fixation, ribulose 5-
phosphate [Mitsui et al ., 2000]. Although HPS and PHI have  been detected in many 
methylotrophs [Ferenci et al., 1974; Arfman et al., 1990], the genes encoding these enzymes 
remain largely unknown. The genes  encoding HPS were cloned from an obligate 
methylotroph, Methylomonas aminofaciens 77a [Yanase et al., 1996], as well as facultative 
methylotrophs, such as Mycobacterium gastri  MB19 [Mitsui et al ., 2000]. Neither enzyme 
was thought to exist outside methylotrophs. Howeve r, bioinformatics analysis has suggested 
that hps and phi gene homologs are widespr ead in bacteria [Yasueda et al., 1999; Mitsui et Introduction 20 Thiol-specific stress response  
 al., 2000;  Yurimoto et al., 2002;  2005]. In B. subtilis , the pathway for FA fixation involves 
the hxlAB  operon including the hps homologous gene hxlA and the phi homologous gene hxlB 
[Yasueda et al., 1999;  Yurimoto et al., 2005]. Interestingly, the hxlAB  operon of B. subtilis  is 
positively regulated by a MarR/DUF24-family regulator HxlR, which shares sequence 
similarity to the YodB repressor [Yurimoto et al ., 2005]. Since the mechanism of HxlR 
activation has not been resolved so far, it is tempting to speculate that also the conserved N-
terminal Cys residue of HxlR plays a role in  sensing aldehydes. Furthermore, the results 
presented in this thesis confir m the thiol-reactive mode of acti on for FA that further supports 
the global control mechanism of  MarR/DUF24-family regulators via the thiol-(S)-alkylation, 
which is reflective for quinones and α,β-unsaturated carbonyls such as MG and FA.

synthase; PHI, 6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase. This figure is adapted from Kato  et al . (2006). 
The last pathway for FA detoxification involves "arc haeal" enzymes and is linked to 
the archaeal cofactors tetrahydromethanopterin (H 4MPT) and methanofuran (MFR) (Fig. 1.6) 
[Chistoserdova et al., 1998]. This pathway has been identified only in methylotrophic bacteria 
and has been characterized in detail in one methylotroph, Methylobacterium extorquens  AM1 
[Vorholt et al., 1998; 2000; Pomper et al., 1999; 2002; Hagemeier et al., 2000]. The initial 
step in this pathway is the reaction of FA with H 4MPT to form methylene-H 4MPT. While this 
reaction can occur spontaneously, as is apparently the case for H 4F, a specific FA-activating 
enzyme (Fae) has been shown to catalyze this  condensation, and this enzyme is required for 
methylotrophic growth [Vorholt et al., 2000]. The resulting methylene-H 4MPT is oxidized to 
methenyl-H 4MPT through the acti on of one of two methylene-H 4MPT dehydrogenases, MtdA Introduction 21 Thiol-specific stress response  
 and MtdB. MtdA, which also catalyzes the oxidation of methylene-H 4F, is strictly NADP 
dependent [Vorholt et al ., 1998], whereas MtdB can use either NAD+ or NADP+ but is 
specific for methylene-H 4MPT [Hagemeier et al ., 2000]. Methenyl-H 4MPT is converted to 
formyl-H 4MPT by methenyl-H 4MPT cyclohydrolase (Mch) [Pomper et al ., 1999]. Finally, 
formate is released from formyl-H 4MPT through the action of the formyltransferase/hydrolase 
complex (Fhc) [Pomper and Vorholt, 2001; Pomper et al ., 2002]. Formate can then be 
oxidized to CO 2 by formate dehydrogenase, as for the H 4F-linked pathway.

6. The aim of this part  of the thesis 
B. subtilis  is exposed to different toxic, antimicrobial and aromatic com pounds in the 
soil. In several previous studies, the expression profile of B. subtilis  was monitored after 
exposure to phenol, salicylic acid, catechol, chromanon and M HQ using the transcriptomic 
and proteomic approaches [Tam et al., 2006b, Duy et al., 2007a; 2007b; Töwe et al., 2007]. 
The results showed the inducti on of the thiol-specific stress response by catechol and MHQ 
that is controlled by the novel MarR-t ype repressors MhqR (YkvE) and YodB 
[Leelakriangsak et al ., 2007; Töwe et al ., 2007]. YodB was identified as novel redox-
controlled transcriptional regulator which di rectly senses thiol-reactive compounds. The Introduction 22 Thiol-specific stress response  
 regulatory mechanism of YodB which involves the conserved Cy s6 residue was one subject 
of this study, which was performed in collabor ation with the group of Peter Zuber (Oregon). 
Furthermore, the YodB-paralogous repressor YvaP was identified by Kazuo Kobayashi as 
repressor of the catechol-inducible catDE  operon. Both, YodB and Yv aP share the conserved 
Cys6 and Cys7 residues. One further goal of th is thesis was to analyze the roles of the 
conserved Cys7 and of the basic arginine and ly sine residues of YvaP for regulation of YvaP 
DNA binding activity in vivo .  
We were further interested in the physiological responses of B. subtilis  to the toxic 
carbonyl electrophiles MG and FA. Thus, the cha nges in the transcriptome and proteome of B. 
subtilis  after exposure to different concentrations of  MG and FA were analyzed in this thesis. 
The results showed that both MG and FA indu ced also a thiol-specific stress response in B. 
subtilis . Thus, we compared the transcriptiona l profiles for all th iol-reactive compounds, 
including diamide, quinones and aldehydes more  specifically using hierarchical gene 
clustering. We found further th at detoxification of FA invol ves the novel MerR/NmlR-like 
activator YraB(AdhR) which controls a conserved thio l-dependent formaldehyde 
dehydrogenase of B. subtilis  (AdhA) and the cysteine proteina se YraA. In collaboration with 
the group of John Helmann (Ithaca), we studied regulation of AdhR in vivo  and in vitro , 
which involves the conserved Cys52 residue of AdhR. Finally, the phenotypes of mutants in 
genes of the FA-inducible AdhR and HxlR regulons were invest igated in this  thesis which 
showed that both contribute  to FA detoxification.

Summary
Recently, we showed that the MarR-type repressorYkvE (MhqR) regulates multiple dioxygenases/glyoxalases, oxidoreductases and the azoreductase
encoding yvaB (azoR2 ) gene in response to thiol-
speciﬁc stress conditions, such as diamide, catechol
and 2-methylhydroquinone (MHQ). Here we report onthe regulation of the yocJ (azoR1 ) gene encoding
another azoreductase by the novel DUF24/MarR-typerepressor, YodB after exposure to thiol-reactivecompounds. DNA binding activity of YodB is directlyinhibited by thiol-reactive compounds in vitro . Mass
spectrometry identiﬁed YodB-Cys-S-adducts that areformed upon exposure of YodB to MHQ and catecholin vitro. This conﬁrms that catechol and MHQ are
auto-oxidized to toxic ortho - and para -benzoquinones
which act like diamide as thiol-reactive electrophiles.
Mutational analyses further showed that the con-served Cys6 residue of YodB is required for optimalrepression in vivo and in vitro while substitution of all
three Cys residues of YodB affects induction of azoR1
transcription. Finally, phenotype analyses revealedthat both azoreductases, AzoR1 and AzoR2 conferresistance to catechol, MHQ, 1,4-benzoquinone anddiamide. Thus, both azoreductases that are controlledby different regulatory mechanisms have commonfunctions in quinone and azo-compound reductionto protect cells against the thiol reactivity ofelectrophiles.
Introduction
The Gram-positive bacterium, Bacillus subtilis is exposed
to a variety of toxic and antimicrobial compounds in the
soil, which induce general and speciﬁc stress responses
in growing cells. As part of the stress response, speciﬁc
detoxiﬁcation systems confer resistance to reactive aro-matic compounds. Catecholic and hydroquinone-likeintermediates are formed within the catabolic pathways of
many aromatic compounds (Vaillancourt et al ., 2006).
They are metabolized by speciﬁc ring-cleavage dioxy-
genases. Two classes of ring-cleavage dioxygenaseshave been identiﬁed based on the mode of ring cleavage:intradiol and extradiol dioxygenases, which cleave thearomatic ring ortho and meta to the hydroxyl substituents
respectively. Catechol and hydroquinones are auto-
oxidized to toxic ortho- and para -benzoquinones in the
presence of oxygen. Quinones can exert their toxicityas oxidants and/or electrophiles (O’Brian, 1991; Monkset al ., 1992; Kumagai et al ., 2002). As oxidants, quinones
act as catalysts in the generation of reactive oxygenspecies (ROS). As substrates for cellular reductases,quinones can undergo one-electron reduction to yieldsemi-quinone radical anions that reduce molecularoxygen, producing ROS such as superoxide anion, andlead to redox cycling reactions. As electrophiles, quinonescan form S-adducts with cellular thiols through reactionsinvolving a 1,4-reductive Michael-type addition. As ortho -
and para -benzoquinones have a one-electron reduction
potential that far exceeds the range for redox-cyclingreactions, these are primarily electrophilic (Rodriguezet al ., 2005). Quinones are also biologically active
compounds that function as lipid electron carriers in theelectron-transport chain (e.g. ubiquinone, menadione)(Unden and Bongaerts, 1997).
Previous proteome and transcriptome analyses
showed a strong overlap in the response of B. subtilis to
catechol, 2-methylhydroquinone (MHQ) and diamide.Diamide is an electrophilic azo-compound that reacts withprotein thiolates leading to the formation of disulphidesor S-thiolated proteins (Leichert et al ., 2003; Hochgräfe
et al ., 2007). Thus, it seems that diamide, catechol and

24MHQ are common thiol-reactive electrophiles that can
generate mixed disulphides and Cys-S-adducts that leadto depletion of cellular protein thiolates. Several regula-
tory factors participate in controlling this complex thiol-
speciﬁc stress response to electrophilic compounds,such as Spx, CtsR, PerR, CymR and the novel MarR-type repressors YodB and MhqR (YkvE) (Leichert et al .,
2003; Nakano et al ., 2003a; Zuber, 2004; Leelakriang-
sak et al ., 2007; Töwe et al ., 2007). The Spx protein of
B. subtilis is a global transcriptional regulator that con-
trols genes whose products function in maintenance ofthiol homeostasis under disulphide stress conditions(Nakano et al ., 2003a; 2005; Zuber, 2004). Regulation
by Spx requires interaction with the C-terminal domain of
the RNA polymerase asubunit (Nakano et al ., 2003a,b).
Recent studies showed that spx transcription initiation at
the P
3promoter located upstream of spx is induced in
response to diamide treatment (Leelakriangsak and
Zuber, 2007; Leelakriangsak et al ., 2007). Two negative
transcriptional regulators, PerR and YodB, were discov-
ered to interact directly with and repress transcriptioninitiation from the spx P
3promoter (Leelakriangsak and
Zuber, 2007). PerR was previously characterized as a
repressor of the peroxide stress regulon (Mongkolsuk
and Helmann, 2002). The novel DUF24/MarR-type
family transcriptional regulator YodB also controls thedivergently transcribed yodC gene which encodes a
putative nitroreductase and is induced in response to
disulphide stress conditions (Duy et al ., 2007; Leelakri-
angsak et al ., 2007). Moreover, three cysteine residues
are present in the YodB protein, which could be the
targets for the redox-sensitive control of repressor activ-ity that responds to thiol-reactive compounds. Thus,YodB might function as a thiol-responsive regulator ofB. subtilis . Recently, we have shown that another MarR-
type repressor MhqR (YkvE) controls three putative
dioxygenases/glyoxalases (MhqA, MhqO and MhqE),the nitroreductase MhqN and the azoreductase YvaB(AzoR2) in response to thiol-reactive electrophiles.These confer resistance to MHQ and catechol inB. subtilis (Töwe et al ., 2007).
In this study, we have identiﬁed a paralogue of azoR2 ,
the azoreductase-encoding azoR1 (yocJ ) gene, which is
the most strongly derepressed member of the YodBregulon under thiol-speciﬁc stress conditions. Mutationalanalyses indicate that the Cys residues of YodB play arole in repressor activity and the repressor’s response toinducing phenolic compounds. The thiol-speciﬁc quinonereactivity of oxidized MHQ and catechol was conﬁrmed in
vitro using mass spectrometry. Finally, we show that the
paralogous enzymes, AzoR1 and AzoR2 that are regu-lated by YodB and MhqR both contribute to electrophileresistance in B. subtilis . Hence, these azoreductases,
which are conserved among Gram-positive bacteria couldplay major roles as quinone reductases, that prevent toxicquinones from undergoing redox-cycling and causingdepletion of cellular thiolates.
Results
Microarray and proteomic analyses identiﬁed the
azoreductase-encoding yocJ (azoR1) gene as most
strongly derepressed in DyodB mutant cells
The novel MarR-type repressor, YodB was shown to
control the expression of spx and that of the
nitroreductase-encoding yodC gene in response to thiol
stress conditions in B. subtilis (Duy et al ., 2007; Leelakri-
angsak et al ., 2007). To identify the genes of the YodB
regulon, B. subtilis wild-type and DyodB mutant strains
were subjected to proteome and transcriptome com-parison. Table 1 lists genes that are at least threefoldderepressed in the DyodB mutant according to the
microarray hybridization analysis. The most strongly
derepressed, YodB-controlled gene was identiﬁed asyocJ , which encodes a putative FMN-dependent NADH-
azoreductase and is also referred to as AzoR1 accord-ing to Swiss-Prot database annotations (AccessionNo. O35022). The very high derepression ratio of azoR1
transcription in the yodB mutant could be due to the fact
that azoR1 is subject to regulation by YodB only, in con-
trast to spx. The azoR1 (yocJ ) transcriptional start site
was mapped previously and the concentration of azoR1
transcript was observed to increase after treatmentwith diamide (Nakano et al ., 2003a). In addition, AzoR1
protein synthesis is strongly increased by diamide, cat-echol, MHQ and nitrofurantoin treatment as shown byproteomic analysis (Fig. 1, Table 1). However, AzoR1protein synthesis was not induced in response to oxida-tive stress provoked by the addition of H
2O2(Fig. 1). The
proteomic analyses veriﬁed the derepression of azoR1
and yodC in the DyodB mutant (Fig. 1). The proteomic
data also conﬁrmed that AzoR1 production is several-
fold more elevated than YodC in the DyodB mutant
(Fig. 1, Table 1). Recently, we showed that production ofthe paralogous azoreductase, AzoR2 (YvaB), is induced
under thiol stress conditions and azoR2 expression is
regulated the MarR-type repressor, MhqR (YkvE) (Töwe
et al ., 2007) (Fig. 1). However, in contrast to AzoR1,
AzoR2 protein synthesis was not induced after diamideor nitrofurantoin stress (Fig. 1). Interestingly, synthesis ofMhqR-regulated azoR2 expression was reduced in the
DyodB mutant and, vice versa , the level of the YodB-
controlled azoR1 and yodC expression was lower in the
DmhqR mutant under control conditions (Fig. 1). In con-
clusion, the microarray and proteome results show that
YodB negatively controls the expression of azoR1, yodC
and spx.Regulation and function of the YodB repressor 1109

25Expression of azoR1 and azoR1-bsrB is induced by
diamide, catechol and MHQ and derepressed in the
DyodB mutant
Northern blot analyses were performed to examine the
level and size of azoR1 transcript in wild-type and DyodB
mutant cells after exposure to MHQ, catechol, diamideand H
2O2. The results veriﬁed the very strong transcription
ofazoR1 in response to catechol, MHQ and diamide
stress in wild-type cells and derepression in the DyodB
mutant (Fig. 2). Consistent with the proteome results,there was no increase in azoR1 transcription in response
to oxidative stress caused by H
2O2. In addition, the basal
level of azoR1 mRNA was reduced in the DmhqR mutant,
which is also consistent with the proteomic data.
Two different azoR1 transcripts were detected using an
azoR1 -speciﬁc RNA probe (Fig. 2A and B). The smaller
0.7 kb transcript is most strongly elevated after catechol,MHQ and diamide stress and corresponds to an azoR1 -
speciﬁc monocistronic transcript. The larger 1.1 kb RNAspecies corresponds to the azoR1-bsrB -speciﬁc transcript
which is only visible in yodB mutant cells and in wild-type
cells after catechol, MHQ and diamide treatment. The bsrB
gene encodes a highly abundant small 6S RNA that istranscribed during exponential growth and decreases inconcentration during stationary phase (Ando et al ., 2002;
Barrick et al ., 2005). The conserved features of this 6S
RNA suggest that it binds RNA polymerase by mimicking
the structure of DNA in an open promoter complex, therebyregulating RNA polymerase activity (Wassarman andSaecker, 2006; Wassarman, 2007). Synthesis of azoR1-
bsrB mRNA in treated wild-type cells was also veriﬁed
using a bsrB -speciﬁc mRNA probe (Fig. 2C). These differ-
entazoR1 -speciﬁc transcripts observed in the Northern
blot suggest that the azoR1-bsrB mRNA might be sub-
jected to RNA processing. However, Northern analysisusing the bsrB -speciﬁc probe indicates that expression of
bsrB can be attributed largely to constitutive transcription
from its own promoter that resides downstream of theazoR1 coding sequence. Thus, the azoR1-bsrB transcript
makes only a minor contribution to bsrB transcription under
thiol stress conditions. Transcription of bsrB as part of the
azoR1-bsrB mRNA under thiol stress conditions might
result from readthrough past the azoR1 terminator owing to
the very high induction of azoR1 transcription.
The DyodB mutant is resistant to catechol and MHQ
stress, which is attributable to derepression of theazoR1 gene
The growth phenotype of the DyodB mutant cells after
addition of the thiol-reactive compounds diamide, cat-echol and MHQ to exponentially growing cells wasanalysed. The growth of the DyodB mutant was similar to
that of the wild-type after exposure to diamide (data notTable 1. Induction of genes after MHQ, catechol, diamide and nitrofurantoin stress in the wild type (wt) and derepression in the DyodB mutant.a

26shown). As reported earlier, the growth of wild-type cells
was inhibited in the presence of 4.8 mM catechol and0.66 mM MHQ (Tam et al ., 2006; Duy et al ., 2007). Inter-
estingly, the DyodB mutant could grow in the presence of
9.6 mM catechol and 0.83 mM MHQ, suggesting that
YodB-controlled genes, derepressed in the yodB mutant,
confer resistance to these phenolic compounds (Fig. 3A).
Likewise, the DmhqR mutant displayed a catechol and
MHQ resistance phenotype as it was able to grow with
12 mM catechol and 1 mM MHQ (Töwe et al ., 2007).
Moreover, DyodB DmhqR double mutant cells showed an
additive hyper-resistance to catechol and MHQ as growthwas still possible in the presence of 19.2 mM catechol and2 mM MHQ (Fig. 3B).
The next step was to determine if the paralogous azore-
ductases AzoR2 and AzoR1, production of which is con-
trolled by MhqR and YodB, respectively, contribute tocatechol and MHQ resistance. As reported previously, the
growth of the DazoR2 mutant was impaired in the pres-
ence of 3.6 mM catechol and 0.5 mM MHQ (Töwe et al .,
2007). Surprisingly, no growth difference was detected for
the azoR1 mutant compared with the wild-type parent
after exposure to these compounds (data not shown).However, deletion of both azoreductases in the
DazoR2 DazoR1 double mutant resulted in a cessation of
growth after exposure to 2.4 mM catechol and cellular
lysis after treatment with 0.5 mM MHQ (Fig. 3C). Thus,theDazoR2 DazoR1 double mutant was more sensitive to
catechol and MHQ stress compared with the DazoR2
single mutant. Moreover, DazoR2 DazoR1 mutant cells
showed a growth defect in the presence of 1 mM diamide
compared with wild-type cells whereas the DyodB DmhqR
double mutant grew faster in the presence of 1 mMdiamide than the wild-type parent (Fig. 3D). These

27data conﬁrmed that paralogous azoreductases encoded
byazoR2 and azoR1 are major MhqR- and YodB-
controlled determinants contributing to catechol and
MHQ resistance. The increased sensitivity of the
DazoR2 DazoR1 double mutant towards thiol-reactive
compounds compared with the DazoR2 single mutant
suggests that AzoR2 could complement AzoR1 deﬁciency
with respect to detoxiﬁcation.
To verify that the resistance of the DyodB mutant to
catechol and MHQ was attributable to azoR1 derepres-
sion, the DazoR1 mutation was introduced into the DyodB
mutant. Notably, the DyodB DazoR1 double mutant wassimilarly sensitive to catechol and MHQ as the wild-type
strain (data not shown). These results conﬁrmed that theresistance of the DyodB mutant was caused by the over-
production of AzoR1.
Diamide, hydrogen peroxide and MHQ impair binding of
YodB protein to azoR1 promoter DNA
To identify the region of the azoR1 promoter DNA required
for transcriptional repression by YodB interaction, DNaseI footprinting was performed. The DNA that was end-labelled on the top strand of the azoR1 promoter wasFig. 3. The DyodB mutant is resistant to
catechol and MHQ (A), the DyodB DmhqR
double mutant is hyper-resistant (B) and

28mixed with YodB protein (Leelakriangsak et al ., 2007),
followed by digestion with DNase I. YodB protected a
region from approximately -20 to +10 relative to the tran-
scription start site (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 8). Promoter
alignments identiﬁed putative sites of YodB recognition(YodB boxes) that were uncovered by DNase I footprintingexperiments of YodB with the spx (Leelakriangsak et al .,
2007) and azoR1 promoters. YodB boxes contained a
common 15 bp consensus sequence of TACTWTTTgWWAGTA (Fig. 4C). In previous work, mutations in the spx
promoter at positions corresponding to the nucleotides 6(T), 7 (T) and 12 (A) of the consensus sequence impairedYodB binding (Leelakriangsak et al ., 2007).
As shown previously, YodB binding activity on spx P
3
promoter DNA was impaired in the presence of diamide
and H 2O2(Leelakriangsak et al ., 2007). A fourfold higher
concentration of YodB was used to demonstrate speciﬁcbinding to the spxP
3promoter then was used for the yocJ
promoter owing to the lower affinity of YodB for the spx
target sequence. Notably, sensitivity of YodB activity to thetoxic electrophiles was still observed despite the high
concentration of YodB used in these experiments. Wefurther determined whether the binding of YodB to theazoR1 promoter is reversed by the addition of diamide,
H
2O2or MHQ in varying concentrations to the footprinting
reactions. As shown in lanes 4, 5, 9–11 in Fig. 4A and
lanes 4–6 in Fig. 4B, YodB bound poorly to the operator
sequence when diamide, H 2O2or MHQ at levels causing
toxicity in wild-type cells was present compared with the
reactions that contained YodB alone (lanes 3, 8 in Fig. 4A
and lane 3 in Fig. 4B). However, the presence of diamide,
MHQ and H 2O2at concentrations that inhibit YodB–target
DNA interaction did not effect DNA binding of CymR
repressor to the yrrT promoter (Leelakriangsak et al .,
2007; M. Leelakriangsak and P . Zuber, unpublished),
showing that these compounds do not have a generaleffect on protein–DNA interaction. In addition, neitherdiamide, H
2O2nor MHQ at the higher concentrations
tested in the DNA-protein-binding experiments affected
DNase I activity (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 7 and Fig. 4B, lane
2). These results conﬁrmed that YodB acts as a repressor
by interaction with azoR1 promoter DNA and impairment
of YodB–DNA interaction occurs when thiol-reactive com-pounds are present.
Role of Cys residues in repression of azoR1
transcription by YodB in vivo
The YodB protein contains three cysteine (Cys or C) resi-
dues, one at the N-terminal position 6 (C6), and two at the
C-terminal positions 101 (C101) and 108 (C108). TheN-terminal Cys residue (C6) is conserved among yodB
homologues in low GC Gram-positive bacteria, unlike thetwo C-terminal Cys residues. These Cys residues may beinvolved in the redox-sensitive control of YodB activity, ashas been shown for Cys residues of other regulatoryfactors involved in the oxidative stress response, such asOxyR, Hsp33 and OhrR (Barbirz et al ., 2000; Graumann
et al ., 2001; Fuangthong et al ., 2002; Hong et al ., 2005;
Nakano et al ., 2005; Lee et al ., 2007). To investigate the
role of Cys residues in YodB-mediated regulation, eachwas replaced with alanine, thus generating the yodBC6A ,
yodBC101A and yodBC108A alleles, along with the
double mutant yodBC101,108A and triple mutant
yodBC6,101,108A . All mutant proteins were produced at
similar levels as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. S1).The expression of azoR1–lacZ fusions were examined
in partial diploid strains bearing the DyodB allele and
ecotopically expressed versions of the C-to-A alleles inte-grated at the thrC locus (Fig. 5A and B). In yodB mutant
cells (ORB7106), azoR1–lacZ activity was ~60-fold higher
compared with wild-type cells (ORB7094). The azoR1–

(ORB7094). However, azoR1–lacZ activity was approxi-
mately eightfold derepressed in the yodBC6A mutant
under control conditions compared with the untreated wild
type. In addition, derepression of azoR1–lacZ activity was
similar in the yodBC6A and triple yodBC6,101,108A
mutants, suggesting that Cys6 is essential for YodB-
dependent repression of azoR1 transcription under
non-inducing conditions. However, there is still YodB-
dependent repression in the yodBC6A and triple
yodBC6,101,108A mutants suggesting that other resi-
dues are required for optimal YodB repressor activity.
Northern blot analysis and primer extension were per-
formed to determine the level of azoR1 transcription after
treatment of yodB Cys-to-Ala mutants with MHQ, catechol(Fig. 5C and D) and diamide (Fig. 5E). As already shown
in Fig. 2, the level of azoR1 transcript increased after
diamide, MHQ or catechol treatment in the wild-type cells
(Fig. 5C and D, lanes 2–3; Fig. 5E, lane 2). The transcript
concentration of azoR1 was high in the untreated DyodB
mutant (Fig. 5C and D, lane 4; Fig. 5E, lane 3) comparedwith untreated wild-type cells (Fig. 5C and D, lane 1;
Fig. 5E, lane 1). Induction of azoR1 transcription in the
yodBC101 ,yodBC108 and yodBC101,108A mutants in
response to catechol, MHQ and diamide was similar to
that of the wild type. However, signiﬁcantly higher basallevels of azoR1 transcripts were observed in the
untreated yodBC6A and triple yodBC6,101,108A mutants
(Fig. 5C and D, lanes 7 and 10; Fig. 5E, lanes 7 and 15)
compared with untreated wild-type cells (Fig. 5C and D,

b-galactosidase activity data (Fig. 5A and B). Quantiﬁca-
tion of the Northern blots revealed ~25-fold derepression
ofazoR1 transcription in the DyodB mutant (Fig. 5D). In
the untreated yodBC6A and triple yodBC6,101,108A
mutants, the amounts of azoR1 mRNAs were approxi-
mately eightfold increased, compared with the untreated
wild type (Fig. 5C, lanes 7 and 10). There was a two- to
threefold induction of azoR1 transcription in the yodBC6A
and yodBC6,101,108A triple mutants after exposure to
catechol and MHQ .But the level of expression in the case
of the triple mutant was lower than the induced level ofwild-type cells (Fig. 5D and E). Furthermore, primerextension analysis of the yodBC6,101,108A triple mutant
showed little if any induction following diamide treatment
(Fig. 5E, lanes 15 and 16), with a lower level of transcriptthan that observed in reactions of RNA from wild-typecells treated with diamide. Together, the Northern andprimer extension analysis suggests that the Cys residuesplay a sensory function required for the repressor’sresponsiveness to the inducing compounds.
The DyodB mutant acquires an increased resistance
to catechol and MHQ owing to the upregulation ofAzoR1. To conﬁrm that the yodBC6A mutant retains this
resistance phenotype owing to weakened repressoractivity, growth experiments were performed in the pres-ence of different concentrations of catechol. The resultsshowed that the yodBC6A single or yodBC6,101,108A
triple mutants could grow with 4.8 mM catechol (Fig. 5F).In contrast, growth of the yodBC101A ,yodBC108A and
yodBC101,108A mutants was similar to the wild type
and inhibited in the presence of 4.8 mM catechol (datanot shown). However, resistance of the yodBC6A single
oryodBC6,101,108A triple mutants was lower than that
ofDyodB mutant cells. These results support the hypoth-esis that the Cys residues are at least in part involved
YodB repressor activity.
To examine YodBC6A protein binding activity to spxand
azoR1 promoter DNA, the YodBC6A protein was puriﬁed
(see Experimental procedures ) and used in DNase I foot-
printing experiments to compare mutant DNA-binding
protein activity with that of wild-type YodB. YodBC6A
protein exhibited reduced binding activity to the target
DNA when compared with the wild-type YodB protein(Fig. 6A and B, lanes 3 and 6). To further clarify whetherthe binding of YodBC6A protein was sensitive to a toxicoxidant, diamide was added to the footprinting reactions.As had been shown previously, diamide reduced YodBbinding to target DNA (Leelakriangsak et al ., 2007).
Diamide also caused a loss of YodBC6A binding activity to
spx and azoR1 promoter DNA in vitro (Fig. 6A and B,
lanes 7–8). These data indicated that YodBC6A could stillfunction and respond somewhat to thiol-reactive com-pounds despite its reduced DNA-binding activity.
Mass spectrometry analysis of YodB modiﬁed in vitro by
catechol and MHQWe next examined whether treatment of YodB with the
thiol-reactive compounds catechol and MHQ leads to spe-ciﬁc Cys6 modiﬁcations. Puriﬁed His6-YodB was cleavedwith Tev (tobacco-etch virus) protease to leave only thetripeptide GAH N-terminal extension of the YodB protein.This modiﬁed YodB protein was incubated for 10 min witheach compound and then digested with trypsin for 2 h. Thetryptic digest was analysed using FT-ICR-MS (Fouriertransform ion cyclotron resonance MS) in the positive ionmode. In the untreated YodB sample, the 573.75 Da masspeak corresponding to the double charged T1 peptide(m/z =1145.49 +2H
+) was found as the most abundant
peptide, suggesting that Cys6 is in the reduced formFig. 6. Reduction of YodBC6A protein

32(Fig. 7A). However, small amounts of T1 peptides with
methionine sulphoxides and the fully oxidized cysteinesulphonic acids were also detected, which could be
generated upon protein puriﬁcation or during sample
preparation.
The treatment of YodB with 1 mM MHQ resulted in the
appearance of a new mass peak of 634.76 Da correspond-
ing to the double charged T1 peptide with a 122 Da modi-
ﬁcation (m/z =1267.52 +2H+) (Fig. 7B). This mass peak
is representative of the sulphhydryl-bound form of MHQ(m/z =T1+122 +2H+) as there is the loss of 2 Da owing to
the phenolic ring-conjugation with the thiolate ( -2H+). The
collision induced dissociation MS/MS analysis of thedouble charged m/z =1267.52 peak conﬁrmed that MHQ
is covalently linked to the Cys6 residue (Fig. S2).
The treatment of YodB with 10 mM catechol caused the
formation of a new mass peak of 627.76 Da correspond-
ing to the double charged T1 peptide with a 108 Damodiﬁcation (m/z =1253.52 +2H
+) (Fig. 7C). This
mass peak represents the Cys6-S-adduct of catechol
(m/z =T1+108 +2H+), which was conﬁrmed by collision
induced dissociation MS/MS analysis of this peptide(Fig. S3). The reduced Cys101 and Cys108 containing
1680.73 Da mass peak was observed in the untreated
YodB sample corresponding to the double chargedT9-peptide (m/z =3359.45 +2H
+) (data not shown). In
addition, the disulphide-bound form of the T9 peptide was
detected in the untreated YodB sample as judged from
the loss of 2 Da of this peptide (m/z =3357.45 +2H+)
(data not shown). Sulphhydryl-bound forms of MHQ and
catechol were also detected for this T9 peptide, suggest-
ing that both MHQ and catechol auto-oxidize to quinones,
which react as electrophiles with protein thiolates.
Discussion
YodB and MhqR affect quinone and azo-compound
detoxiﬁcation by controlling production ofparalogous azoreductases
In this study, we uncovered the azoreductase-encoding
azoR1 gene as the most strongly derepressed member of
the YodB regulon. The yodB mutant showed increased
resistance to catechol and MHQ, which could be attrib-uted to the function of AzoR1. The YodB-controlled azoR1
gene encodes an azoreductase, AzoR1, which is a para-logue of AzoR2, speciﬁed by the MhqR-regulated azoR2
gene. Production of both enzymes responds tothiol-speciﬁc electrophiles and confers resistance to cat-
echol and MHQ in B. subtilis (Töwe et al ., 2007). Thus,
both enzymes have similar functions related to the detoxi-ﬁcation of catechol and MHQ. Catechol and hydroquino-nes can be auto-oxidized to the corresponding ortho -and
para -benzoquinones that can act as toxic oxidants and
electrophiles (Fig. 8). The formation of the benzoquinonescould be detected by the appearance of a red-colouredmedium if cells are exposed to growth-inhibitory concen-tration of catechol and MHQ.
Quinones are enzymatically reduced via two different
pathways: (i) formation of semi-quinone radicals and reac-tive superoxide anions via one-electron reduction (e.g.NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, z-crystallin) and (ii)
formation of hydroquinones in the two-electron reductionby NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductases (Ernster, 1987).The functions of the azoreductases AzoR1 and AzoR2are related to NADH:quinone reductases, also called dia-phorases, which catalyse the NAD(P)H-dependent two-electron reductions of quinones, quinoneimines, azodyesand nitrogroups to protect cells against the toxic effects offree radicals and ROS arising from the one-electronreductions (Ernster, 1987; Li et al ., 1995; Cavelier and
Amzel, 2001). The azoreductases could function todetoxify the quinones back to redox-stable catechol and
MHQ to protect cells against the redox-cycling actionand reaction as electrophiles targeting protein thiolates(Fig. 8). This thesis is further supported by the fact that theDmhqR and DyodB mutants show a four- to ﬁvefold
increased resistance to para -benzoquinone (our unpub-
lished data). The toxicity of para -benzoquinone is more
than 50-fold higher than that of hydroquinone inB. subtilis , which might explain the thiol-reactive electro-
philic nature. It has been further shown, that AzoR2 pos-sesses NADH:DCIP oxidoreductase and azoreductaseactivity (Nishiya and Yamamoto, 2007). Azoreductases
are ﬂavoenzymes that have the unique ability to catalysea wide range of biochemical reactions and have broadsubstrate speciﬁcity (Fraaije and Mattevi, 2000). Thus,both azoreductases, AzoR1 and AzoR2 could also
function in the reductive cleavage of the electrophileazo-compound diamide to 1,1 ′-dimethylurea. Another ﬂa-
voenzyme, the nitroreductase YodC is also regulated by
YodB, and is a paralogue of MhqN, the gene for which is
controlled by MhqR. Thus, paralogous nitroreductasesare co-regulated with paralogous azoreductases inresponse to thiol-reactive electrophiles. Nitroreductasescatalyse the two-electron reduction of nitrogroups in
Fig. 7. Modiﬁcation of YodB in vitro by MHQ and catechol. Puriﬁed YodB (5 mg) was incubated for 10 min with 1 mM MHQ and 10 mM
catechol and analysed by FT-ICR-MS in the positive ion mode after tryptic digestion. In the untreated YodB sample, the double charged T1
peptide was mostly detected in the Cys6-reduced form (m/z =573.75) (A). Methionine sulphoxide modiﬁcations of T1 are indicated with an
asterisk and cysteine sulphonic acid modiﬁcation of T1 is indicated by #. After treatment of YodB protein with MHQ, a new peak corresponding
to the double charged T1 with Cys6-S-conjugated MHQ was detected (m/z =634.76) (B). The treatment with catechol resulted in a new mass
peak corresponding to the double charged T1 with Cys6-S-conjugated catechol (m/z =627.76) (C).Regulation and function of the YodB repressor 1117

33nitroaromatic compounds to nitroso, hydroxylamine inter-
mediates and ﬁnally primary amines (Bryant and DeLuca,1991). As quinones also represent substrates for nitrore-
ductases (Nivinskas et al ., 2002), YodC and MhqN could
function in quinone reduction in B. subtilis . There is the
question: Why have paralogous azo- and nitroreductases
evolved that act upon the same class of substrates, but
are separately regulated by YodB and MhqR? Two
oxygen-insensitive FMN-containing nitroreductases, NfsAand NfsB, have been also characterized in Eschericia coli .
Of these, NfsA uses NADPH as electron donor whereasNfsB can use either NADH or NADPH as source ofreduction equivalents (Zenno et al ., 1996a,b). Thus, the
paralogous nitro- and azoreductases of B. subtilis that
contribute to quinone resistance could use different elec-
tron donors for quinone reduction. The detailed mecha-nism of quinone reduction remains to be elucidated,however.Interestingly, neither of these azo- or nitroreductases
was induced by oxidative stress provoked by H
2O2or the
redox-cycling agent paraquat (our unpublished data)
supporting the thesis that these enzymes are speciﬁcally
involved in quinone and electrophile reduction and not in
the oxidative stress response. As ROS are producedupon auto-oxidation of MHQ and catechol, this couldaccount for the induction of the PerR-controlled oxidative
stress response by electrophiles. Other quinone oxi-
doreductases such as QorA of Staphylococcus aureus
are produced in response to oxidative stress and thesecatalyse the one-electron reduction of quinones, thusproducing superoxide anions (Maruyama et al ., 2003).
Interestingly, QorA is homologous to the quinone oxi-doreductase YfmJ of B. subtilis. YfmJ protein was also
induced by MHQ treatment (Duy et al ., 2007) and indeed
functions in quinone reduction in vitro (A. Maruyama,
pers. comm.). In addition, production of many otherProposed mechanism for electrophile detoxification in B. subtilis

Fig. 8. Thiol-speciﬁc reactions of electrophilic compounds and model for the functions of MhqR- und YodB-controlled azoreductases and
dioxygenases/glyoxalases in B. subtilis. Catechol and MHQ are oxidized to the corresponding ortho - and para -benzoquinones that cause
S-adduct formation via 1,4-reductive addition of thiols to quinones (Michael-type addition) (Rodriguez et al ., 2004). The paralogous
azoreductases AzoR1 and AzoR2 are major quinone resistance determinants and function in quinone reduction to catechol and MHQ
(Cavelier and Amzel, 2001). Diamide is an electrophilic azo-compound that reacts with protein thiolates and causes disulphide bond formationor mixed disulphides with LMW thiols (Leichert et al ., 2003; Hochgräfe et al ., 2007). AzoR1 and AzoR2 also confer resistance to diamide and
functionin detoxiﬁcation of diamide via the reductive cleavage of the azo group, resulting in two molecules 1,1 ′-Dimethylurea. The paralogous
dioxygenases/glyoxalases which are co-regulated with the azoreductases (Töwe et al ., 2007) might be involved in the thiol-speciﬁc
detoxiﬁcation of the LMW-thiol-S-adducts via dioxygenolytic cleavage of the compounds. Thus, this mechanism of electrophile resistance is
coupled to the thiol-speciﬁc stress responsive regulatory network.1118 M. Leelakriangsak et al./H17039

34NAD(P)H-oxidoreductases responds to MHQ or catechol
and might contribute to either the one-or two-electron reduction of quinones in B. subtilis
(Duy et al ., 2007).
The mechanism of quinone reduction by nitro- and
azoreductases is coupled to the thiol-speciﬁc stressresponse in B. subtilis
The question arises why regulation of quinone reductionby the azoreductases is coupled to the thiol-speciﬁcstress response in B. subtilis . Quinones exert their tox-
icity mainly as electrophiles via the 1,4-reductive nucleo-
philic addition to protein thiolates (Michael-type addition)leading to thiol-S-adduct formation (Fig. 8). Thus,quinone and diamide exposure results in depletion ofprotein thiolates and non-protein-low molecular weight(LMW) thiolates. B. subtilis does not possess glutathione
and instead, the major LMW thiols of B. subtilis are likely
cysteine, CoASH, or the recently reported 398 Da bio-thiol (Newton et al ., 1996; Gusarov and Nudler, 2005;
Lee et al ., 2007; Hochgräfe et al ., 2007). Recently, it has
been shown that diamide triggers S-cysteinylation in vivo
in a number of B. subtilis cytoplasmic proteins that have
catalytic cysteine residues (e.g. GuaB, MetE and PpaC)(Hochgräfe et al ., 2007). The formation of mixed disul-
phides with the LMW thiol cysteine is proposed as amechanism to protect catalytic cysteine residues againstoxidation to irreversible sulphonic acid. Thus, the LMWthiol cysteine could function as a GSH equivalent indetoxiﬁcation of electrophiles via cysteine-S-adduct for-mation. The CymR regulon which regulates cysteine bio-synthesis is also derepressed under the conditions ofdiamide, catechol and MHQ stress which supports theidea of cysteine depletion owing to S-adduct formationwith electrophiles.
The MarR-type repressor MhqR regulates expression
ofazoR2 and genes encoding multiple dioxygenase/
glyoxalase family enzymes in response to thiol stressconditions (Töwe et al ., 2007). These dioxygenases/
glyoxalases could be involved in the thiol-dependent ringcleavage of the catechol- and MHQ-S-adducts (Fig. 8).This proposed mechanism of electrophile detoxiﬁcation issimilar to the GSH-dependent detoxiﬁcation of methylgly-oxal and other electrophiles (e.g. N-ethylmaleimide) in
E. coli which involves glutathione-S-adduct formation with
the electrophiles and detoxiﬁcation via the glyoxalasepathway or release of these GSH-adducts from the cell(Ferguson et al ., 1998, 1999; McLaggan et al ., 2000;
Booth et al ., 2003). The results reported herein suggest
that azo- and nitroreductases function in the detoxiﬁcationof electrophiles whereas dioxygenases/glyoxalase couldbe involved mainly in detoxiﬁcation of the redox-stableS-hydroquinone adducts.The Cys residues of YodB function in sensing
thiol-reactive electrophiles
In this study, the regulation of the MarR/DUF24-family
repressor YodB in response to thiol-speciﬁc electrophileswas uncovered in B. subtilis . YodB is highly conserved
among low-GC Gram-positive bacteria and several para-logues are encoded within the B. subtilis genome. YodB-
like regulators share the conserved N-terminal cysteine inposition 5 or 6 followed by a conserved proline residue.As reported herein, this conserved Cys6 is essential forrepression of YodB-controlled target genes in vivo and in
vitro . Inactivation of Cys6 in a yodBC6A mutant resulted in
a decreased repression of azoR1 in vivo . Furthermore,
the conserved Cys6 was found to play a role in regulation
of YodB activity as observed by examining the phenotypeof the yodBC6A mutant, which was more resistant to
catechol than the wild-type cells. Thus, it could be pos-sible that the Cys6 residue has a higher reactivity to formthe nucleophilic thiolate than the Cys101 and Cys108residues. There was still some repression of YodB-dependent genes in the yodBC6A mutant in vivo as the
basal level of azoR1 transcription was lower in the
yodBC6A mutant compared with the yodB null mutant.
Transcription of azoR1 was still two- to threefold inducible
in the yodBC6A mutant after exposure to catechol and
MHQ, suggesting that there might be other sites in theYodB protein that are involved in regulation of YodBactivity. Electrophilic quinone-like compounds could reactwith other nucleophilic amino acids present in the YodBprotein, thereby inﬂuencing YodB DNA-binding activity.Interestingly, there are reports that quinone-like electro-philes can also form chemical adducts on protein nitrogennucleophiles at the N-terminus and at the basic aminoacid side-chains of lysine, arginine and histidine residues(Person et al ., 2003; 2005). As several basic lysine and
arginine residues are present in the N-terminal part of the
YodB protein, further mutagenesis studies are required toresolve this issue. Notably, the C-terminal C101 and C108
residues are not required for YodB repression, but were
found also in disulphide bond form in vitro as revealed
by mass spectrometry. The triple mutant, C6,101,108A,shows reduced repression, but also lower responsiveness
to inducers, suggesting the Cys residues of YodB could
serve a sensory function by reacting directly with thiol-reactive compounds.
Using mass spectrometry we uncovered the formation
of Cys-S-adducts upon treatment of YodB with MHQ andcatechol in vitro conﬁrming the thiol reactivity of the quino-
nes produced upon catechol and MHQ auto-oxidation.
Thus, the derepression of YodB in response to diversearomatic compounds might be caused by their commonelectrophilic nature, which leads to covalent cysteinemodiﬁcations. Cysteine residues are strong nucleophilesRegulation and function of the YodB repressor 1119

35and form redox centres in an emerging group of oxidative
stress transcription factors such as the E. coli oxidative
stress regulator OxyR and the B. subtilis organic hydrop-
eroxide repressor OhrR (Fuangthong et al ., 2002; Paget
and Buttner, 2003; Hong et al ., 2005; Lee et al ., 2007). All
attempts to detect YodB modiﬁcations upon treatment
with diamide failed using mass spectrometry. We only
observed that the peptide containing Cys6 was absent
in the MS spectrum after diamide treatment (data notshown). Thus, the mechanism of YodB inactivation upondiamide treatment is currently unknown. As S-thiolationhas been shown as one mechanism of OhrR and OxyRregulation (Kim et al ., 2002; Lee et al ., 2007), modiﬁcation
of YodB could occur in vivo in response to diamide and
other electrophiles via the formation of mixed disulphides
containing cysteine, CoASH or other LMW thiols. Onegoal of our future proteomic studies will be to determinewhether the YodB repressor is regulated by S-thiolation orS-adduct formation by electrophiles in vivo . However,
detection of S-conjugates with quinone-like electrophiles,which are formed in vivo will be difficult using mass spec-
trometry as these are rather unstable modiﬁcations andare often lost upon prefractionation procedures.
In summary, our studies uncovered the function and
regulation of the YodB repressor that controls the expres-sion of spx, and the genes that encode the azoreductase
AzoR1 and the nitroreductase YodC in response to thiol-speciﬁc electrophiles. We show that the conserved Cys6residue of YodB is required for optimal YodB-mediatedrepression in vivo and in vitro and that the three Cys
residues function in inducer sensing. In addition, wereport that paralogous azoreductases AzoR1 and AzoR2both confer resistance to catechol and MHQ in B. subtilis .
Hence, we presume that these azoreductases ofB. subtilis function as quinone reductases and constitute
major detoxiﬁcation pathways to protect bacteria fromquinone toxicity. As these azo- and nitroreductases arehighly conserved among pathogenic Gram-positive bac-teria, it will be interesting to ﬁnd the naturally ocurringquinone-like substrates for these enzymes.
Experimental procedures
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
Bacillus subtilis strains used in this study are derivatives of
JH642 and 168 and are listed in Table S1. Cells were culti-
vated in a shaking water bath at 37°C in Difco sporulation
medium (DSM) for b-galactoisidase assays or TSS minimal
medium and Belitsky minimal medium (Stülke et al ., 1993) for
treatments with thiol-reactive compounds. Diamide and
hydrogen peroxide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.MHQ was purchased from Acros and catechol was pur-chased from Fluka.
The isogenic azoR1 mutant was constructed by transfor-
mation of JH642 with chromosomal DNA of the azoR1D(yocJ::pMutin4 ) strain, which carries an azoR1–lacZ fusion,
resulting in a strain designated ORB6734. The yodB mutant
bearing an azoR1–lacZ fusion was constructed by transfor-
mation of ORB6734 with chromosomal DNA of ORB6208(yodB mutant) (Leelakriangsak et al ., 2007) to generate
ORB6735.
The azoR1–lacZ fusion was constructed by transformation
of JH642 competent cells with plasmid pML78, which carriesanazoR1–lacZ fusion, resulting in strain ORB7093. pML78
was generated by PCR using primers oSN03-64 and oSN03-65. The PCR fragment ( -155 to +110 with respect to the
azoR1 transcription start site) was digested with enzymes
EcoRI and BamHI, and then was inserted into plasmidpDH32 which was digested with the same enzymes. TheazoR1 sequence was veriﬁed by DNA sequencing. Plasmid
pCm::tet was used to transform ORB7093, replacing the Cm
r
cassette with a Tetrmarker to generate strain ORB7094.
The yodB disruption strain bearing azoR1–lacZ fusion was
constructed by transformation of ORB7094 with chromo-
somal DNA of ORB6208 (Leelakriangsak et al ., 2007).
The resulting strain was designated ORB7106 ( azoR1–lacZ ,
yodB ). Diploid yodB strains bearing azoR1–lacZ fusion were
constructed as follows. The chromosomal DNA of ORB6606
(thrC::yodB ) (Leelakriangsak et al ., 2007), ORB6592
(thrC::yodBC6A ), ORB6713 ( thrC::yodBC101A ), ORB6714
(thrC::yodBC108A ), ORB6775 ( thrC::yodBC101,108A ) and
ORB7081 ( thrC::yodBC6,101,108A ) were used to transform
ORB7106 ( azoR1–lacZ ,yodB ) to generate ORB7107,
ORB7108, ORB7109, ORB7110, ORB7111 and ORB7112
respectively. The yodB ::pMutin4 and azoR2 ::pMutin4
mutants were constructed during the course of the European
and Japanese B. subtilis functional analysis project.
Chromosomal DNA of the azoR2 ::pMutin4 (ST8) and
yodB ::pMutin4 (ST5) mutants were introduced by trans-
formation into the DazoR1 mutant (ST7) to generate the
DazoR1 DazoR2 (ST9) and DazoR1 DyodB (ST10) double
mutants respectively. The DmhqR mutant (TF176) was trans-
formed with chromosomal DNA of the yodB ::pMutin4 (ST5)
mutant to generate the DyodB DmhqR double mutant (ST6).
The lesions harboured by the mutants were veriﬁed by PCR.
When necessary, the following antibiotics were added (at a
concentration shown in parenthesis): ampicillin (25 mgm l-1),
chloramphenicol (5 mgm l-1), erythromycin plus lincomycin (1
and 25 mgm l-1respectively), and tetracycline (12.5 mgm l-1).
Construction of yodBC6A, C101A, C108A, C101,108A
and C6,101,108A mutants
Plasmids pML60(C6A), pML65(C101A), pML66(C108A),
pML69(C101,108A) and pML76(C6,101,108A) were pro-
duced by using PCR mutagenesis. First-round PCR was
performed in two separate reactions with primers oyodB-EcoRI with oyodB-C6AR and primers oyodB-C6AF with
oyodB-HisB (Table S2) using JH642 chromosomal DNA as
template. The PCR products were hybridized and subse-quently ampliﬁed by a second round of PCR using primersoyodB-EcoRI and oyodB-HisB. The products from the secondround PCR were then digested with EcoRI and BamHIrestriction enzymes and inserted into plasmid pUC19 thatwas digested with the same enzymes to generate pML60.pML76 was generated by the same procedure as that used1120 M.

36for construction of pML60, but using pML69 as template. The
PCR product ( ª60 bp) that was synthesized using primer
oyodB-C101A and oyod-HisB was used as the primertogether with oyodB-EcoRI for second round PCR to gener-ate pML65. pML66 was generated by using primers oyodB-
EcoRI and oyodB-C108A. Primers oyodB-EcoRI and oyodB-C108A (Table S2) were used to produce pML69 using pML65as the template. The yodB sequences were veriﬁed by DNA
sequencing. The plasmids pML60, pML65, pML66, pML69and pML76 were digested with EcoRI and BamHI and thereleased fragments bearing the mutations were then insertedinto pDG795 that was digested with the same enzymesto generate pML61, pML67, pML68, pML72 and pML77
respectively. pML61, pML67, pML68, pML72 and pML77
were introduced by transformation with selection forerythromycin-lincomycin resistance, into JH642, whereyodBC6A ,C101A ,C108A ,C101,108A and C6101,108A frag-
ments integrated into the thrC locus. The resulting strains
were designated ORB6592 ( thrC::yodBC6A ), ORB6713
(thrC::yodBC101A ), ORB6714 ( thrC::yodBC108A ),
ORB6775 ( thrC::yodBC101,108A ) and ORB7081
(thrC::yodBC6,101,108A ). Chromosomal DNA of ORB6592,
ORB6713, ORB6714, ORB6775 and ORB7081 were usedto transform ORB6288 to generate ORB6599, ORB6715,ORB6716, ORB6777 and ORB7083 respectively.
Transcriptome analysis
For microarray analysis, the B. subtilis 168 wild-type and
isogenic DyodB (TF277) mutants were grown in minimal
medium and harvested at OD 500of 0.4. Total RNA was iso-
lated by the acid phenol method as described (Majumdar
et al., 1991). The generation of ﬂuorescence-labelled cDNA
and hybridization with B. subtilis whole-genome microarrays
(Eurogentec) was performed as described previously (Jürgen
et al., 2005). Two independent hybridization experiments
were performed using RNAs from two independent sets ofcultures. Genes showing induction ratios of at least threefoldin two independent experiments were considered as signiﬁ-cantly induced. An independent microarray experiment wasconducted using strains ORB6208 ( DyodB::cat ) and the
JH642 parent. Procedures for RNA puriﬁcation and micro-array analysis were described previously (Nakano et al.,
2003a; Choi et al., 2006).
Assay of b-galactosidase activity
Toluene treatment and assays of b-galactosidase activity
using o-nitrophenyl- b-D-galactopyranoside were performed
as previously described (Nakano et al ., 1988; Schrogel and
Allmansberger, 1997). b-Galactosidase activity is expressed
as Miller Units (Miller, 1972).
Protein puriﬁcation
The yodB coding sequence was ampliﬁed by PCR using
primers oyodB-HisNC6A and yodB-HisB. The PCR products
were digested with NdeI and BamHI restriction enzymes and
inserted into pPROEX-1(Life Technologies) digested with thesame enzymes to generate pML74. Cells were cultured andthe protein was puriﬁed as described previously (Leelakriang-
sak et al ., 2007).
Primer extension analysis
Strains ORB6284, ORB6288, ORB6599, ORB6715,
ORB6716 and ORB6777 were grown at 37°C in TSS
medium. Primer extension analysis was performed as
described previously (Leelakriangsak and Zuber, 2007).Primers oML02-15 and oSN03-63 were used to synthesize
the primer extension products to examine the transcripts of
spx and azoR1 respectively.
DNase I footprinting
A DNA probe for azoR1 (position corresponding -160 to +110
with respect to transcription start site) was synthesized by
PCR ampliﬁcation using primers oSN6-03–64 and oSN03-65.
Dideoxy sequencing ladders were obtained using the ThermoSequenase cycle sequencing kit (USB) and the PCR product
specifying azoR1 as template. The same primers used for the
footprinting reactions were also used for sequencing. DNase
I footprinting reactions were performed as described previ-ously (Leelakriangsak et al ., 2007).
Proteome analysis
Cells grown in minimal medium to an OD 500of 0.4 were
pulse-labelled for 5 min each with 5 mCi of L-[35S]methionine
per ml before (control) and 10 min after exposure to 0.33 mM
MHQ, 2.4 mM catechol, 1 mM diamide, 0.1 mM nitrofuran-toin and 100 mMH
2O2. Preparation of cytoplasmic
L-[35S]methionine-labelled proteins and separation by two-
dimensional gel electrophoresis using the immobilized pHgradients in the pH range 4–7 was performed as described(Tam et al ., 2006). The quantitative image analysis was per-
formed with the DECODON Delta 2D software (http://www.
decodon.com).
Northern blot analyses
Northern blots were performed as described (Wetzstein et al .,
1992) using RNA isolated from B. subtilis wild-type and
DyodB (TF277) mutant cells before (control) as well as 10
and 20 min after treatment with 2.4 mM catechol or 0.33 mM
MHQ. Hybridizations speciﬁc for azoR1 and bsrB were
performed with the digoxigenin-labelled RNA probes synthe-
sized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase from T7 promoter-
containing PCR products ampliﬁed with azoR1 -speciﬁc
primers (yocJ_for and yocJ_rev) and bsrB -speciﬁc primers
(bsrB-for and bsrB-rev).
FT-ICR-MS analysis
LC-ESI MS experiments were performed using an LTQ (linear
ion trap) FTICR mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, San
Jose, CA). The SEQUEST algorithm Version 27.12 (Thermo
Electron) was used to search for modiﬁcations of the YodBtryptic peptides. A mass deviation of 0.01 Da for precursorRegulation and function of the YodB repressor 1121

37ions as well as for fragment ions and one missed cleavage
site of trypsin were allowed. The search result was ﬁlteredusing BioWorks 3.2 (Thermo Electron). A multiple thresholdﬁlter applied at the peptide level consisted of the followingcriteria: (i) peptide sequence length: 7–30 amino acids; (ii)
RSp/H113494; (iii) percentage of ions: 70 (70% of all theoretical b-
and y-ions of a peptide are experimentally found); and (iv)Xcorr versus charge state: 1.90 for singly charged ions, 2.20for doubly charged ions and 3.75 for triply charged ions.

CatR (YvaP) was characterized as a furt her YodB-paralogous thiol-stress sensing 
DUF24/MarR-type repressor of th e previously characterized yfiDE  (catDE ) operon in B. 
subtilis . K. Kabayashi identified the MarR-type regulator YvaP as a repressor of the catDE  
operon by using transcription f actor arrays. B. Möhl was involved in construction and 
phenotype analysis of the yvaP  mutant, overproduction and purification of the YvaP 
repressor. H. Antelmann carried out DNase I footprinting analyses and gel mobility shift 
assays of purified YvaP protein to the yfiDE  promoter. These revealed that DNA binding 
activity of YvaP is directly inhibited in the presence of thiol- reactive electrophiles.  Mass 
spectrometry analysis of thiol-modifications  caused in YvaP by diamide and quinones were 
performed by H. Antelmann and D. Becher. F. Schuster performed non-reducing SDS-PAGE 
analysis, which showed that diamide and quinones cause an inters ubunit disulfide bond 
formation in vitro  and in vivo  in YvaP. My contribution in this chapter is the construction of 
yvaP  point mutants and the Nort hern blot analysis of yfiDE  transcription in these points 
mutants to analyze the roles of Cys7 and basi c arginine and lysine residues (K19A, R20A,

Bacillus subtilis /YvaP/ YodB/ MarR-type 
regulator/ quinone/ dioxygenase 
SUMMARY 
The response to electrophilic quinones is 
governed by a complex network of thiol-stress sensing transcription factors. Recently, we have found that two MarR-type repressors, YodB and YkvE control paralogous azoreductases, nitroreductases and three dioxygenases/glyoxalases, which 
respond to thiol-reactive electrophiles, such as catechol, 2-methylhydroquinone and diamide. These enzymes confer resistance to quinone compounds and diamide, and protect ce lls against the thiol-
reactivity of electrophile s. In this paper, we 
have identified a further YodB-paralogous thiol-stress sensing MarR-type regulator, YvaP as repressor of the previously characterized yfiDE  (catDE ) operon which 
encodes a catechol-2,3-dioxygenase and a DoxX-like oxidoreductase. Phenotype   experiments revealed that YvaP confers resistance to catechol, but not to hydroquinone-like el ectrophiles. Among 
the YodB-paralogs encoded in the B. 
subtilis  genome, YvaP and YodB display 
most close sequence similarities and share 
the conserved N-terminal cysteine in position 6 and 7, respectively. DNA binding experiments showed that YvaP protects two 6-1-6 bp inverted repeat sequences (YvaP-boxes) with the consensus of TTACtTtAaGTAA overlapping the yfiDE  
promoter region. DNA binding activity of YvaP was inhibited by quinone-like electrophiles and diamide  in vitro  
suggesting that also YvaP is directly sensing thiol-stress conditions via the 
conserved Cys7. Mutational analyses 
showed that the conserved Cys7 is essential for YvaP regulation in vivo  and probably 
serves as a sensor for thiol-reactive 
compounds . In addition, also the basic 
amino acids K19, R20 were shown to be essential for YvaP repression in vivo  as 
well as most other conserved basic arginine 
and lysine residues located in the DNA 
binding HTH motif. Mass spectrometry and non-reducing PAGE analysis revealed the formation of an in tersubunit disulfide 
bond in a YvaP dimer upon treatment with thiol-reactive compounds in vitro . Together 
our data reveal that B. subtilis  has evolved 
a network of three MarR-type repressors 
YkvE (MhqR), YodB and YvaP that control paralogous quinone resistance determinants.  
INTRODUCTION 
Bacillus subtilis  is exposed in the soil to a 
variety of antimicrobial agents that also 
include phenolic compounds, which are produced by other soil bacteria, plants or 
fungi. Catecholic or hydroquinone-like intermediates are common in the metabolism CatR (YvaP)   43   Huyen et al., 2008a  
 of nitroaromatic compounds or organic 
insecticides (Vaillancourt et al., 2006). They 
are metabolized by specific ring-cleavage 
dioxygenases, the interdiol or extradiol 
dioxygenases which cleave  the aromatic ring 
ortho  and meta  to the hydroxyl substituents, 
respectively. Catechol and hydroquinone-like 
compounds can also cause toxic effects in 
microorganisms since these can be autooxidized to ortho - and para -
benzoquinones. Quinones can exert their toxicity as oxidants and/or electrophiles 
(O`Brian, 1991; Monks et al., 1992; Kumagai 
et al ., 2002). As oxidants, quinones redox 
cycle with their semiquinones producing 
reactive oxygen species such as superoxide 
anion or hydrogen peroxi de. As electrophiles, 
quinones can form S-adducts with cellular 
thiols via the thiol-(S)-alkylation reaction 
which is an irreversible thiol-modification. 
However, quinones are also biologically active compounds that function as lipid electron carriers in the electron-transport chain (e.g. ubiquinone, menadione) (Unden and Bongaerts, 1997). Thus, quinones are naturally occurring th iol-reactive compounds 
that are ubiquitously di stributed in bacterial 
systems. 
Recently, proteomic and transcriptomic 
approaches revealed that catechol and 2-methylhydroquinone (MHQ) act like diamide as thiol-reactive compounds in B. subtilis . 
Thus, quinone compounds and diamide have the same mode of actio n causing depletion of 
protein and low molecular weight (LMW) thiols. This leads to induction of the complex thiol-specific stress response in B. subtilis  
which is regulated by Spx, CtsR, PerR, CymR and the novel MarR-type repressors MhqR (YkvE) and YodB (Nakano et al ., 2003; 
Nakano et al ., 2005; Zuber, 2004; 
Leelakriangsak et al ., 2007; Leelakriangsak 
and Zuber, 2007; Töwe et al ., 2007; 
Leelakriangsak et al., 2008; Antelmann et al., 
2008). Recently, we further showed that DNA binding activity of YodB is directly regulated 
via thiol-(S)-alkylation in response to 
quinone-like electrophiles in vitro  which is an 
irreversible thiol-modification that cannot be reduced using thiol-disulfide exchange reaction as catalyzed by the thioredoxin-
thioredoxin reductase system (Leelakriangsak  
et al. , 2008). Thus, YodB was identified as 
novel MarR/DUF24-family repressor which 
senses thiol-reactive compounds via the 
conserved Cys6 residue which was also essential for YodB-dependent repression in 
vivo. Together, the MarR -type repressors 
YodB and MhqR control paralogous azoreductases (AzoR1 and AzoR2), nitroreductases (YodC and MhqN) and thiol-dependent dioxygenases (MhqA, MhqE and MhqO) (Töwe et al., 2007; Leelakriangsak  et 
al., 2008; Antelmann et al ., 2008). The 
paralogous azoreductases are major quinone 
resistance determinants and have common functions as quinon e reductases thus 
preventing toxic quinones from undergoing 
redox-cycling and causing depletion of 
cellular thiols. The paralogous thiol-dependent dioxygenases (MhqA, MhqE and MhqO) share similarity to the chlorohydroquinone/hydroquinone 1,2-dioxygenase of Sphingomonas paucimobilis  
LinE (Miyauchi et al ., 1999; Endo et al ., 
2005). Also MhqA and MhqO confer 
resistance to quinone-like electrophiles and 
could be involved in the specific ring-
cleavage of S-quinone adducts which are 
formed in the detoxification reaction of the 
LMW thiol buffer with quinones (Töwe et al., 
2007).  Our previous studies identified another thiol-
stress inducible yfiDE  (catDE ) operon, which 
encodes an enzyme with catechol-2,3-
dioxygenase activity (CatE) and a DoxX-like oxidoreductase CatD (Tam et al., 2006; Duy 
et al ., 2007). In this stu dy, we report on the 
identification and characterization of the thiol-stress MarR/DUF24 repressor YvaP, 
which regulates this yfiDE  (catDE ) operon in 
B. subtilis  and is strongly related to the YodB 
repressor as judged by sequence similarity and function. We further show the importance of the conserved sensing Cys7 and the basic amino acids K19, R20, R49A, R54A, K56A, 
R75A and K83A for regulation of DNA 
binding activity of YvaP in vivo . Non-
reducing PAGE and mass spectrometry analyses revealed the formation of CatR (YvaP)   44   Huyen et al., 2008a  
 intersubunit disulfide bonds in YvaP dimers 
by quinones and diamide as regulatory mechanism in vitro .  
RESULTS 
1. Identification of YvaP as a repressor of 
the catE -lacZ fusion using transcription 
factor (TF) arrays 
Previously, we have identified four thiol-
dependent dioxygenases encoded by mhqA , 
mhqE , mhqO and yfiE (catE) that all respond 
to thiol-specific stress conditions, such as 
diamide, catechol and MHQ (Tam et al ., 
2006; Duy et al ., 2007). Moreov er, three of 
these thiol-dependent dioxygenases (MhqA, MhqE and MhqO) are controlled by the novel MarR-type regulator MhqR (YkvE) (Töwe et 
al., 2007). In addition, the fourth dioxygenase 
CatE was shown to f unction as catechol-2,3-
dioxygenase in vitro  (Tam et al ., 2006). 
However, the specific regulator of the catDE  
operon was unknown. To identify the regulator of the yfiDE  operon, we have 
applied the transcripti on factor/transformation 
array technology (TF array) (Hayashi et al ., 
2006; Kobayashi, 2007). Using this TF array 
technology, we have previously identified MhqR (YkvE) as a repr essor of the thiol-
dependent dioxygenase encoding mhqE  
(yodE ) (Töwe et al ., 2007). Chromosomal 
DNA of each of the 287 transcription factor deletion mutants was transformed into the 
ΔyfiE mutant which carries a yfiE-lacZ fusion 
due to integration of the non-replicating pMutin4 plasmid. The ΔyvaP  deletion mutant 
showed derepression of the yfiE-lacZ fusion 
on LB plates containing Xgal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl- β-D-galactopyranoside) 
(Fig. 1). Thus, YvaP was identified as a 
candidate repressor, wh ich could be involved 
in negative regulation of the yfiDE  operon in 
response to thiol-specific stress conditions. However, when we identified YvaP as a repressor of the yfiDE  operon, we noticed that 
the coding region of the annotated yvaP  
sequence according to SubtiList (
http://genolist.pasteur.fr/SubtiList/) overlaps 
with that of the coding regions of the flanking downstream yvaO  gene and the upstream 
yvaQ  gene. Homology comparison revealed 
that YvaP belongs to the MarR/DUF24-family of transcriptional regulators and is closely related to YodB. These sequence comparisons showed that the start codon of yvaP  is wrong annotated and the correct start 
ATG was found 250 bp further downstream (Fig. S1). In addition, sequencing of the yvaO-yvaP-yvaQ  region revealed an error in 
the stop codon. The previ ously annotated stop 
codon had a wrong inserted guanine residue at nucleotide positio n 574 which caused a 
frame shift. After correction of the sequencing error, the correct stop codon is repositioned 131 bp upstream of the previous stop codon (Fig. S1).  Consequently, the 
corrected yvaP  gene consists of 327 bp and 
encodes a protein of 108 aa which shares 46% sequence homology to the YodB repressor (Fig. 2). 
2. The ΔyvaP  mutant shows a catechol 
resistance phenotype 
Previous phenotype anal yses showed that the 
growth of ΔyfiE deletion mutant was impaired 
in the presence of 3.6 mM catechol which 
reduced the growth rate of the wild-type strain only slightly (Tam et al., 2006). Thus, 
the yfiDE  operon confers resistance to 
catechol. Examination of the growth 
phenotype of the ΔyvaP  mutant after 
treatment with diamide, catechol and MHQ showed that the ΔyvaP  mutant was able to 
grow with 9.6 mM catec hol, concentrations 
which are toxic to wild -type cells (Fig. 1B). 
Thus, likewise to the ΔyodB  and ΔmhqR  
mutants, also the ΔyvaP  mutant showed a 
catechol resistance phenotype. However, in contrast to the ΔmhqR  and ΔyodB  mutants, 
the ΔyvaP  mutant strain showed no increased 
resistance to MHQ and diamide suggesting 
specific detoxification functions of the YvaP-controlled thiol-specifi c dioxygenase CatE for 
catechol-like electrophiles.

The ΔyvaP mutant is resistant

wild type (wt)  and the ΔyvaP 
mutant were grown in minimal 
medium to an OD

treated with 4.8 and 9.6 mM 
catechol at the time points that 
were set to zero.  
YodB was previously characterized as the 
thiol-stress sensing repressor of the MarR/DUF24 family which is involved in 
regulation of spx, yodC  and azoR1  
transcription (Leelakriangsak et al ., 2008; 
Antelmann et al ., 2008). MarR/DUF24-like 
regulators are cons erved among low GC 
Gram-positive bacteria. These all share at 
least one conserved Cys residue in the N-terminal part and one or two Cys residues in 
the C-terminal part at less conserved positions (Fig. S2). Moreover, in the most closely 
related MarR/DUF24-like regulators, the conserved N-terminal Cys is preceded by 
conserved Met or Leu and Pro residues. Those YodB paralogs ar e widely distributed 
among the taxon firmicutes  including other 
Bacillus  species, such as B. cereus , B. 
anthracis , B. halodurans or B. licheniformis  
as well as species of the genus Listeria , 
Staphylococcus , Enterococci  or Clostridia 
(Fig. S2). Moreover, the genome of B. subtilis  
encodes at least 8 MarR/DUF24 family 
regulators, most of which have unknown 
functions (YybR, YdeP, YkvN, YtcD, YdzF, HxlR, YodB and YvaP) that are listed in the DBTBS database for transcriptional regulation of B. subtilis  (
http://dbtbs.hgc.jp/) 
(Fig. 2). We have previously shown that the 
MarR/DUF24 member YodB senses thiol-
stress conditions su ch as quinone compounds 
via thiol-(S)-alkylation at the conserved Cys6. 
Here, we have identified one further 
MarR/DUF24 family member, YvaP as a regulator of the yfiDE  operon that shows 
strong sequence homology to YodB (Fig. 2). 
YvaP also shares the conserved Met-Cys-Pro residues, which are common for YodB-paralogs found among the taxon firmicutes . 
Cys6 was postulated as sensing Cys for YodB in response to thiol-reactive electrophiles as also shown by mutagenesis studies. Since YodB and YvaP both respond to thiol-stress conditions in vivo and share strong sequence 
similarities, these could be regulated via 
similar mechanism which was also subject of this study. 
4. Transcription of the yfiDE (catDE)  
operon is induced by MHQ, catechol and 
diamide in the wild-type strain and 
derepressed in the ΔyvaP  mutant 
In previous Northern blot experiments, the 
expression and transcript ional organization of 
the yfiDE operon were analyzed  (Duy et al ., 
2007). These data showed that yfiD is 
cotranscribed with the yfiE gene and strongly 
induced in response to quinone-like electrophiles (catechol and MHQ) and also 
diamide (Fig. 3A). However, in contrast to 
the MhqR-regulated dioxygenases MhqA, MhqE and MhqO that have been detected also at the proteome level, we could not 
detect induction of the catechol-2,3-dioxygenase CatE in the proteome (Tam et 
al., 2006; Duy et al ., 2007). Northern blot 
analyses further revealed that the catDE  CatR (YvaP)   46   Huyen et al., 2008a

of the yvaP  DNA sequence and

sequence. The start codon is

previously annotated ATG. The 
stop codon is located 131 bp 
upstream in relation to the 
wrongly annotated stop codon after correction of the sequencing 
error.
operon is derepressed in the ΔyvaP  mutant 
which suggests that YvaP is a repressor of the 
catDE  operon (Fig. 3A). However, we 
observed still some induction of catDE  
transcription in the ΔyvaP  mutant after 
exposure to quinone-generating compounds 
MHQ and catechol which points to additional 
control mechanisms. We next determined the transcriptional start site of the  yfiDE operon 
using total RNA of wild type and ΔyvaP  
mutant cells which were exposed to MHQ and catechol stress us ing primer extension 
experiments (Fig. 3B). The 5’ end of the yfiDE  specific mRNA was mapped at adenine 
located 36 bp upstream of the start codon 
(Fig. 4A). This transcriptional start site is 
preceded by σ
A-type promoter sequence. 
Transcription of yfiDE  is strongly initiated 
from this σA-dependent promoter in response 
to thiol-specific stress conditions (MHQ, 
catechol and diamide).  
To identify other genes that are regulated by 
the YvaP repressor, microarray experiments were performed to compare gene expression 
in B. subtilis  ΔyvaP  mutant cells to that of the 
wild type strain in minimal medium during 
the exponential gr owth phase. However, these 
transcriptome comparisons showed that only the genes of the yfiDE  operon were 18-24-
fold reproducible up-regulated in the ΔyvaP  
mutant (data not shown). This suggests that the yfiDE  operon is the only target for 
repression by YvaP in B. subtilis .  
5. DNA binding experiments of YvaP to the 
yfiDE promoter To identify the cis-acting sequences which 
function as operator sites for repression by YvaP, DNase I footprinting analysis was performed of purified YvaP protein on the top and bottom strands of the yfiDE  promoter 
using a yfiDE  promoter DNA probe labeled 
with polynucleotidkinase at the 5’ end (Fig. 
4A and B). Purified Hi s-tagged YvaP protein 
protected a region overlapping the yfiDE  
promoter from positions -56 to +12 relative to 
the transcription start site. Based on these footprinting results, we have searched for inverted repeat sequences in the YvaP-protected regions (F ig. 4B). The YvaP-
protected regions contain two 6-1-6 bp imperfect inverted repeat sequences that overlap the transcripti on start point (BS1) and 
the -35 promoter region (BS2) with the 
consensus of TTACtTtAaGTAA which was designated as YvaP box (Fig. 4B). This YvaP box consensus was used to search the  B. 
subtilis genome for additional YvaP boxes 
using the “Search Pattern” function of the 
SubtiList data base (
http://genolist.pasteur.fr/SubtiList). 
However, no additional sequences were 
detected in the promoter regions of other B. 
subtilis  genes without mismatches to this 
YvaP consensus sequence (data not shown). 
In addition, previous microarray data (Tam et 
al., 2006; Duy et al ., 2007) do not show an 
increased transcription of the yvaP  gene in 
response to thiol-specific stress conditions. These previous results and the lack of the YvaP consensus sequence in the yvaP  
promoter indicate that yvaP  is not subject to 
autoregulation. Thus, we can conclude that CatR (YvaP)   47   Huyen et al., 2008a

the YvaP regulon consists only of the yfiDE  
operon.  
6. DNA binding activity of YvaP is 
inhibited by thiol-reactive compounds and 
H2O2 
Catechol and MHQ are not directly 
electrophilic, but beco me electrophilic after 
auto-oxidation to toxic ortho-  and para -
benzoquinones which form S-adducts with cellular thiols by a thiol-(S)-alkylation 
reaction (Leelakriangsak et al ., 2008; 
Antelmann et al., 2008). Previously we have 
proposed that the YodB repressor might be 
regulated via thiol-(S)-alkylation by quinone-
like electrophiles in vitro  which lead directly 
to inhibition of DNA binding activity of 
YodB. Thus, gel mobility shift assays were 
performed to analyze whether DNA binding activity of YvaP is also directly affected by thiol-reactive compound s or reactive oxygen 
species. Two shifted DNA-YvaP binding complexes were detected with increasing concentrations of YvaP which accounts for the two operator sites in the yfiDE  promoter 
that were protected by YvaP in the DNase I footprinting experime nts. The gel shift 
analyses further showed that DNA binding activity of YvaP to the yfiDE promoters is 
directly inhibited in the presence of thiol-reactive electrophiles (MHQ, benzoquinone, diamide) and H
2O2 (Fig. 5). This indicates 
that the conserved Cys7 residue of YvaP could also serve a sens ory function for thiol-
reactive electrophiles in B. subtilis . 
7. The conserved Cys7 residue of YvaP serves as an electrophile sensor in vivo   
In a recent study, we showed that mutation of the conserved Cys6 of YodB affects DNA binding activity of YodB in vivo  and in vitro  
to its target promoter. This suggests that Cys6 serves a sensory function for quinone-like electrophiles. However, repression was not fully relieved in the YodBCys6 mutant since also the Cys6 and triple Cys6, 101, 108A mutants still responded to quinones. In contrast to YodB, the YvaP protein lacks the 
C-terminal Cys residues present in YodB and shares only the cons erved Cys7, which is 
preceded by conserved Met and Pro residues 
(Fig. 2, Fig. S2). Thus, we have investigated 
the role of Cys7 of YvaP in regulation and 
DNA binding activity. In addition, the reactivity of the thiolate anion is often influenced by neighboring basic arginine and lysine residues. Thus, we have further generated YvaP alleles with point mutations in conserved arginine a nd lysine residues that 
were ectopically placed into the thrC locus 
into the yvaP  mutant. Specifically, we have 
generated YvaPR9A, K19A, R20A, R35A, R49A, R54A, K56A, R75A and K83A point 
mutants. Of these conserved basic amino acid residues R49, K56 and R75 were shown before to interact with the DNA (Hong et al.,  CatR (YvaP)   48   Huyen et al., 2008a

primer extension analysis, 5 µg RNA each were applied isolated from the  B. subtilis  strains before (co) and 10 min after 
the exposure to 0.33 mM MHQ, 2.4 mM catechol (cat), 1 mM  diamide (dia). The arrows point toward the size of the 
catDE  specific transcripts. The 5’  end of the catD specific transcripts is marked by  an arrow and the -10 promoter 
sequences are labeled with a solid line. For dideoxynucleotide sequencing, the dideoxy nucleotide added in each

2005). All YvaP Cys, Lys and Arg point 
mutants were analyzed for DNA binding activity and inducer responsiveness by 
quinone compounds using yfiDE  specific 
transcriptional analysis in Northern blot 
experiments (Fig. 6).  As already shown in Fig. 3, the level of the 
yfiDE specific  transcript was derepressed in 
the untreated ΔyvaP  mutant but also the 
ΔyvaP  mutant showed some 1.5-2-fold 
induction of yfiDE  transcription by catechol 
and MHQ stress (Fig. 6). Next, we compared 
transcription of the yfiDE  operon in the 
ΔyvaP  mutant strain complemented with the 
yvaP  allele to the yvaP  point mutants. The 
basal level of yfiDE  transcription was about 
3-fold higher in the untreated yvaPC7A  
mutant strain compared to the yvaP  
complemented strain and showed a similar 
derepression level like the ΔyvaP  mutant. 
This confirms the previous hypothesis that 
Cys7 of YvaP is essential for sensing thiol-reactive compounds in vivo . In addition, the 
conserved basic amino acids including K19, 
R20, R49, R54, K56, R75A  and K83A were 
also essential for DNA binding activity of YvaP since these point mutants showed a 
similar derepression level as the ΔyvaP  
mutant under control conditions. Only the 
R9A and R35A point mutants had a similar basal level of yfiDE  transcription as the yvaP  
complemented strain. Like the ΔyvaP  mutant, 
also the C7A, K19A, R20A, R49A, R54A, K56A, R75A and K 83A point mutants 
showed a similar further induction by thiol-reactive compounds suggesting other levels of control as already mentioned. In conclusion, the Northern blot results of yfiDE  
transcription in the yvaP  point mutants 
revealed that Cys7 ha s a sensory function in 
regulation of DNA bindi ng activity of YvaP 
and that the conserve d basic arginine and 
lysine residues except for R9 and R35 are 
also essential for DNA binding activity of 
YvaP.

Previously, we have identified specific 
quinone-S-adducts, which are formed upon treatment of the purified YodB repressor with 
catechol and MHQ in vitro  (Leelakriangsak et 
al., 2008). Thus, we were interested in the 
mass spectrometry analysis of the YvaP 
repressor to identify the specific Cys7 
modification that prevents repression of the 
catDE  operon. In following, the His-tagged 
YvaP protein was treated with quinones (catechol, MHQ and BQ) and diamide, and the modified YvaP protein was analyzed using non-reducing SDS-PAGE for the formation of intersubunit disulfide bonds 
(Fig. 7). Interestingly, we observed that quinone compounds and diamide lead to 
formation of intersubunit disulfides in a 32 
kDa YvaP dimer in vitro . These disulfide-
linked YvaP-dimers can be reduced in the presence of DTT to the 16 kDa YvaP 
monomers. Thus, our analyses showed that 
YvaP is regulated by reversible disulfide bond formation in response to quinones and diamide. We further confirmed the formation of the intermolecular disulfide bond in YvaP

the untreated YvaP protein, the 548.2 Da mass peak corresponds to the double charged T1 peptide (m/z=1094.44+2H
+) which 
showed that the N-terminal Cys7 peptide 
(sequence MNQSEMCPR) is in the reduced 
form (Fig. 7A).  
The treatment of YvaP with 1mM MHQ, 10 mM catechol and 1mM BQ resulted in the disappearance of the reduced T1 peptide and 
the appearance of three new mass peak of 
547.97 Da, 551.97, 555.97 and 559.97 Da (Fig. 7B-D, left panels). Interestingly, the 547.97 Da peak corresponds to the four-fold charged disulfide-bounded T1 dimer (m/z=2187.88+4H+). The other newly observed mass peaks corresponded to one, 
two and three additional oxygen masses of 16, 32 and 48 Da which are representative for the formation of 1-3 methionine sulfoxides in the T1 dimer (m/z=2203.88+4H+, m/z=2219.88+4H+, m/z=2235.88+4H+). We were unable to find Cys-S-adduct formation of YvaP with quinone-compounds as previously shown for the YodB repressor. 
These results show th at quinones and diamide 
cause intermolecular disulfide bonds in YvaP-dimers in vitro . However, since quinones cause predominantly irreversible thiol-(S)-alkylation and even aggregation with cellular thiol-containing proteins in vivo  
(Liebeke et al., 2008), the in vivo  mechanism 
for YvaP regulation could also involve thiol-(S)-alkylation which has to be resolved in future studies. 
DISCUSSION 
In this study, we have identified a further 
thiol-stress sensing MarR-type repressor, 
YvaP which controls the catechol-2,3-
dioxygenase encoding catDE  operon. Thus, 
we rename YvaP herewith as CatR repressor. CatR is highly similar in sequence and function to the YodB re pressor (Fig. 2) that 
controls the azoreductase AzoR1(YocJ), the nitroreductase (YodC) as well as Spx (Leelakriangsak et al ., 2008). The CatR 
controlled target genes were defined as the 
catDE  operon. CatE was previously 
characterized as thio l-dependent catechol 2,3-
dioxygenase which catalyzes the extradiol 
cleavage of catechol to 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehydes in vitro . CatD is similar to the 
membrane-bound DoxX- and DoxD-subunit of the thiosulfate:quin one oxidoreductase of 
Acidianus ambivalens  involved in the early 
steps of sulfur oxidation (Müller et al., 2004). 
Thus, CatE is the fourth thiol-dependent 
dioxygenase of B. subtilis  which is 
paralogous to the three MhqR-regulated 
dioxygenases MhqA, MhqE and MhqO that 
are co-regulated by the MhqR repressor in response to thiol-stress conditions. In addition, CatD is paralogous to the MhqR-regulated DoxX-like oxidoreductase MhqP. Furthermore, the MarR-type repressors YodB and MhqR control also paralogous azoreductases AzoR1 and AzoR2 as well as 
paralogous nitroreductases, YodC and MhqN (Töwe et al ., 2007; Leelakriangsak  et al. , 
2008; Antelmann et al ., 2008). These 
paralogous azoreductases are major quinone resistance determinants and have common functions as quinon e reductases thus 
preventing toxic quinones from undergoing redox-cycling and causing depletion of 
cellular thiols. Thus, both YodB and YvaP CatR (YvaP)   52   Huyen et al., 2008a

repressors control toge ther azoreductases, 
nitroreductases, DoxX-like oxidoreductases 
and thiol-dependent di oxygenases of which 
paralogous genes are cont rolled by the MhqR 
repressor in B. subtilis . Furthermore, the 
MarR-type repressors YodB, CatR and MhqR 
confer resistance to quinone-like 
electrophiles. Our previous studies have 
shown weak catechol-2,3-dioxygenase (C-2,3-O) activity for the purified CatE protein. Future studies should define if CatE is more specifically involved in  the thiol-dependent 
cleavage of catechol-thiol-S-adducts that is formed with LMW thiols.  
Both, YodB and CatR repressors also share the conserved N-terminal Cys6 and Cys7 residue, respectively that are essential for regulation and sensi ng of electrophile 
compounds in vivo  and in vitro . This N-
terminal Cys residue is also conserved among MarR/DUF24 family members in other Gram-positive bacteria, and thus it is tempting to speculate that this Cys serves as conserved sensor for electrophile compounds. Interestingly, B. subtilis  has in total 8 
MarR/DUF24-family regulators (YybR, YdeP, YkvN, YtcD, Yd zF, HxlR, YodB and 
YvaP), and of these, YodB and YvaP share the highest degree of homology (Fig. 2). The first identified MarR/DUF24-family regulator of B. subtilis  was HxlR, which is an activator 
of the hxlAB  operon that encodes the genes 
for the ribulose monophosphate pathway 
(Yurimoto et al ., 2005). The 3-hexulose-6-
phosphate-sythase HxlA and the 6-phospho-
3-hexuloisomerase HxlB  are activated in 
response to formaldehyde stress and are 
involved in formaldehyde detoxification. 
YodB and YvaP act both as transcriptional repressors in contrast to HxlR which is activated after exposure of cells to formaldehyde stress. The ClustalW sequence comparison further revealed that the MarR/DUF24 family members YybR, YdeP 
and YkvN are closely related to HxlR and also share a conserved N-terminal Cys residue. In addition, previous transcriptome analyses and our unpub lished transcriptional 
studies revealed that yybR  and ykvN  are 
induced by quinone-lik e electrophiles (Duy et 
al., 2007). This indicates that YybR and 
YkvN are autoregulated as many other MarR-type regulators (Wilkinson and Groove, 2007). Furthermore, YybR acts as transcriptional activat or of another quinone 
oxidoreductase in response to thiol-reactive compounds (our unpublished data). Detailed future work is required to elucidate the function and regulation of all these uncharacterized MarR/DUF24 family CatR (YvaP)   53   Huyen et al., 2008a

Fig. 7. Non-reducing SDS-PAGE analysis reveals int ersubunit disulfide bond formation in YvaP by MHQ and 
diamide in vitro . Purified YvaP protein (1 µg) was incubated for 30 min with 1mM MHQ (A) and 1 mM diamide  (B) 
and subsequently either treated with DTT (+DTT) or left reduced (-DTT) and subjected to non-reducing SDS-PAGE 
analysis. The bands which are labeled as insets in (A) were tryptic digested and analyzed by FT-ICR-MS in the positive

the reduced form (m/z=548.22). (D) After treatment of YvaP with MHQ  and diamide, new peaks appeared 
corresponding to the four-fold charged disulfide bonded T1 dimer (m/z=647.97) and one, two, three methionine

regulators and their regulons in that thiol-
stress responsive regulatory network.   In this study, we show further that YodB and 
CatR have similar functions by the control of 
thiol-stress-inducible genes required for quinone detoxification. Ho wever, the specific 
mechanisms of YodB and YvaP regulation 
were different in our in vitro  experiments. For 
the YodB repressor we could identify thiol-
(S)-alkylation of the co nserved Cys6 residue 
by quinone compounds in vitro  using mass 
spectrometry which could be responsible for YodB regulation by quinone-like electrophiles. In contrast, the formation of 
intersubunit disulfides in YvaP-dimers was shown by exposure to quinones and diamide which inhibits DNA bi nding activity of YvaP 
in vitro . Thus, our ongoing studies are 
directed to identify the specific Cys-modification which is leads to relief of YvaP-
dependent repression by quinones and diamide in vivo .  In addition, more detailed in 
vitro  experiments are require d to show if also 
DNA binding activity of YvaP is DTT-
reversible in vitro . Both modes of actions, 
reversible and irreversible modifications are 
possible as the regulatory in vivo  mechanism 
for YvaP and YodB by quinone-compounds 
since these can act as oxidants or 
electrophiles. Quinones are substrates for cellular quinone reductases that generate the highly toxic semiquinone  anions during the 
one-electron reduction which in turn reduce molecular oxygen producing reactive oxygen species such as super oxide anion or hydrogen 
peroxide. These ROS coul d lead to reversible 
and irreversible oxidations of protein thiols. 
As electrophiles, quinones can form S-adducts with cellular thiols which involves a 1,4-reductive Michael-type addition that is also referred as thiol-(S)-alkylation. Since 
benzoquinone has a one-electron reduction CatR (YvaP)   54   Huyen et al., 2008a  
 potential that far exceeds the range for redox-
cycling reactions, these are primarily electrophilic as shown in the yeast model 
(Rodriguez et al ., 2004). Our data support 
that quinones do not lead to increased 
reversible thiol-oxidations in cellular protein thiols. We further showed that quinones react 
via the irreversible thiol-(S)-alkylation with 
cellular thiol-containing proteins in vivo  
which leads to irreversible aggregation and 
depletion of proteins in the proteome (Liebeke et al ., 2008). Thus, the in vivo  
mechanism for YvaP and YodB regulation by quinones might involve mo st likely thiol-(S)-
alkylation. 
However, the YodB and CatR repressors both also respond to diamide stress, which is known to cause disulfide bonds and mixed 
disulfides with LMW thiols in B subtilis . This 
mechanism of S-thiolation is similar to the S-
glutathionylation, which is thought to protect 
protein thiols against overoxidation to irreversible sulfonic acids (Lee et al ., 2007; 
Hochgräfe et al ., 2007). It has been further 
shown that different organic hydroperoxides 
lead to different mechanisms for regulation of the well-studied OhrR repressor in B. subtilis . 
Inactivation of OhrR by cumene 
hydroperoxide requires Cys15 oxidation 
which leads either to a sulfenamide in vitro  or 
a mixed disulfide (S-thiolated) form of OhrR in vivo  (Lee et al., 2007). In contrast, lineolic 
acid was shown as 100-fold more strongly oxidizing peroxide which leads to irreversible 
sulfonic acid formation and a sacrificial regulation (Soonsanga et al ., 2008). Also 
other redox-sensitive regulators, such as E. 
coli OxyR or Hsp33 were shown to be 
regulated by specific Cys-modifications in response to oxidative st ress, including thiol-
disulfide switches, S-nitrosylation, S-glutathionylation, sulfenic acid formation (Barbirz et al., 2000; Graumann et al., 2001; 
Kim et al., 2001; Barford, 2004). However, in 
contrast to these ty pical redox-sensitive 
regulators, the YodB and CatR repressors do not respond in vivo  to oxidative stress but 
instead, their target genes are specifically derepressed in vivo  by electrophilic 
compounds, such as quinone compounds and diamide. The chemistry is different for 
quinones and diamide leading either to ROS formation and thiol-(S)-alkylation for 
quinones or to disulfide bond formations by 
diamide. Thus, the in vivo  mechanisms for 
regulation of the YvaP and YodB repressors 
can involve reversible and irreversible thiol-
oxidations or thio l-(S)-alkylation 
mechanisms. Recent data indicate that YodB is redox-controlled via intersubunit disulfide 
formation in response to diamide in vivo  (our 
unpublished data). This YodB mechanism is similar to the two-Cys sensing mechanism for OhrR of Xanthomonas campestris  which also 
involves an intersubunit disulfide bond 
between one N-terminal Cys22 of one subunit and one C-terminal Cys127 of the other subunit (Panmanee et al., 2006). We currently 
define the nature of the intermolecular disulfide bond, which is formed in the YodB dimer upon diamide stress using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry.  
Thiol-(S)-alkylation was recently discovered as a novel mode of redox-regulation by electrophilic compounds in human neuronal cells. In neuronal cells , electrophiles activate 
the Keap1-Nfr2 pathway with the consequent 
induction of the antioxidant phase-2 enzymes 
that include also quinone oxidoreductase and 
glutathione S-transfer ase (Satoh and Lipton, 
2007). Keap1 is an adapter protein for ubiquitinating Nfr2, whic h drives degradation 
of this transcription factor. Electrophilic 
compounds react with key cysteine residues in the Keap1 electrophile sensor to form 
adducts, which cause the liberation of Nfr2 
and transport into the nucleus where it binds to antioxidant response (ARE) elements and stimulates phase-2 gene transcription. Thus, 
such electrophilic compounds have 
neuroprotective effects in neuronal cells. Interestingly, this Keap1 sensor has been shown to be regulated by thiol-disulfide switches in mouse cells and by thiol-(S)-alkylation in human cells (Wakabayashi et 
al., 2004; Satoh et al ., 2007; Satoh and 
Lipton, 2007).  
This study shows that YvaP has like YodB an essential conserved Cys residue that senses electrophilic compounds. The reactivity of CatR (YvaP)   55   Huyen et al., 2008a  
 cysteine is often determined by neighboring 
basic amino acids which lower the cysteine pKa to generate the reactive cysteine thiolate 
anion. Stabilization of th e active site thiolate 
anion by neighboring ba sic amino acids has 
been shown for the oxidative stress 
responsive regulators OxyR of E. coli  and 
OhrR of B. subtilis  (Choi et al ., 2001; 
Soonsanga et al ., 2007). Our YvaP point 
mutant analyses further showed that also the conserved K19 and R20 residues were essential for DNA binding activity of YvaP which could determine the reactivity of the Cys7 thiolate anion. It  has been also shown 
that neighboring basic amino acids facilitate 
the thiol-(S)-alkylation of the reactive thiolate 
anion (Dennehy et al., 2006). In addition, all 
conserved basic lysine and arginine residues 
located in the helix-t urn-helix (HTH) motif 
are essential for DNA binding of YvaP as shown previously also for the OhrR repressor (Hong et al., 2005).   
In conclusion, we have identified a further thiol-stress responsive MarR/DUF24-family repressor, CatR which regulates the thiol-dependent catechol-2,3-dioxygnenase CatE in B. subtilis  and confers resistance to catechol-
like electrophiles. The mechanism of YvaP 
regulation involved also the conserved 
sensing Cys7 which has been previously shown to be critical for the YodB repressor. Thus, B. subtilis  has evolved a complex 
network of three MarR-lik e repressors that act 
in the same detoxification pathway for quinone-related electrophiles in B. subtilis .

minimal medium described previously (Stülke et al., 1993). Escherichia coli  strains 
were grown in LB for DNA manipulation. 
The antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: 1 µg/ml erythromycin and 5 
µg/ml chloramphenicol. The compounds used were 2-methylhydroquinone  (Acros), catechol 
(Fluka), diamide and H
2O2 (Sigma).  
The ΔcatE mutant strain that harbors the 
catE-lacZ fusion was constructed using the 
pMutin4 plasmid as described previously 
(Tam et al ., 2006). The transcription factor 
(TF) deletion mutants were constructed using 
an overlap-extension PCR technique as described previously (Kobayashi, 2007). The cat gene was amplified from the plasmid 
pCBB31 by PCR with primers pUC-F and pUC-R. Upstream and downstream regions of each regulator gene were amplified by PCR using gene-specific primer sets F1/R1 and F2/R2 as described previously (Kobayashi, 2007). Specifically, the primer sets yvaP-
F1/yvaP-R1 and yvaP-F2/yvaP-R2 were used for amplification of the yvaP  upstream and 
downstream regions (Tab. S2). The 5’ end of 
primers R1 and F2 are complementary to pUC-R and pUC-F sequences, respectively. Then, the three PCR fragments were mixed and used as template for a second PCR reaction with primers F1 and R2. The resultant PCR fragments were used for transformation of B. subtilis  168.

yvaPK19A, yvaPR20A, yvaPR35A,  
yvaPR49A, yvaPR54A, yvaPK56A, yvaPR66A, yvaPR75A and yvaPK83A point 
mutants  
 To amplify the yvaP  gene including the 
flanking regions, PCR was performed with primers yvaP-EcoRI and yvaP-BamHI (Tab. S2) using chromosomal DNA of B. subtilis  
168 as template. The PCR-product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI restriction enzymes and inserted into pDG795 that was digested with the same enzymes to generate pDG yvaP . The yvaP sequence was verified 
by DNA sequencing. Plasmids pDG yvaPC7A , 
pDG yvaPR9A , pDG yvaPK19A , 
pDG yvaPR20A , pDG yvaPR35A , 
pDG yvaPR49A , pDG yvaPR54A , 
pDG yvaPK56A , pDG yvaPR66A , 
pDG yvaPR75A and pDG yvaPK83A were CatR (YvaP)   56   Huyen et al., 2008a  
 produced by using the GeneTailor Site-
Directed mutagenesis System (Invitrogen). All plasmids were verified by DNA 
sequencing for correct introduction of the 
yvaP  point mutations. Plasmids 
pDG yvaPC7A , pDG yvaPR9A , 
pDG yvaPK19A , pDG yvaP20A , 
pDG yvaPR35A , pDG yvaPR49A , 
pDG yvaPR54A , pDG yvaPK56A , 
pDG yvaPR66A , pDG yvaPR75A and 
pDG yvaPK83A were transformed into the 
thrC locus in the yvaP  mutant strain with 
selection for erythomycin-lincomysin resistance. The resulting strains were 
designated BM4 ( thrC::yvaPC7A ), BM5 
thrC::yvaP ), BM6 ( thrC::yvaPR9A ), BM7 
(thrC::yvaPK19A ), BM8 ( thrC::yvaPR20A ), 
BM9 ( thrC::yvaPR35A ), BM10 
(thrC::yvaPR49A ), BM11 ( thrC::yvaPR54A ), 
BM12 ( thrC::yvaPK56A ), BM13 
(thrC::yvaPR66A ), BM14 ( thrC::yvaPR75A ), 
BM15 ( thrC::yvaPK83A ).  
Transcription factor array analysis   
The transcription factor array analysis was 
performed as described previously (Hayashi et al ., 2006; Kobayashi, 2007) using 
competent cells of the ΔcatE::pMutin4 strain 
which carries a catE-lacZ fusion.  
Transcriptome analysis  
For microarray analysis, the B. subtilis wild 
type and ΔyvaP  mutant were grown in 
Belitsky minimal medium and harvested at 
OD
500 of 0.4. Total RNA was isolated by the 
acid phenol method as described (Majumdar 
et al . 1991). Generation of fluorescence-
labeled cDNA and hybridization with B. 
subtilis whole-genome microarrays (Eurogentec) was performed as described previously (Jürgen et al ., 2005). Two 
independent hybridization experiments were performed using RNAs from two independent experiments. Genes showing induction ratios of at least three-fold  in two independent 
experiments were considered as significantly induced. Northern blot experiments  
Northern blot analyses were performed as 
described (Wetzstein et al., 1992) using RNA 
isolated from B. subtilis  wild-type, ΔyvaP , 
yvaPC7A , yvaPR19A ,  yvaPK19A , yvaPR20A, 
yvaPR35A,  yvaPR49A, yvaPR54A, 
yvaPK56A, yvaPR66A, yvaPR75A and 
yvaPK83A mutant cells before (control) as 
well as 10 min after the treatment with 2.4 mM catechol or 0.33 mM 2-MHQ, respectively. Hybridizations specific for catE 
were performed with the digoxigenin-labeled 
RNA probes synthesized in vitro  using T7 
RNA polymerase from T7 promoter containing internal PCR products of the respective genes using the primer sets as  
described (Tam et al., 2006).  
Primer extension experiments  
Primer complementary to the N-terminal 
encoding region of catD  (yfiD-PE2) was 5’-
end labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase 
(Roche Diagnostics) and 50 µCi [ γ
32P]-ATP 
(GE Healthcare). Primer extension analysis 
was performed using the labeled primers as 
described previously (Wetzstein et al., 1992). 
Sequencing of the corresponding promoter 
regions was performed as described (Sanger et al., 1977) using PCR products as templates 
containing the promoter region of the respective genes amplified with primer set yfiD-FT-for2 and yfiD-FT-PE2 (Tab. S2). 
Expression and purification of the YvaP 
protein  
E. coli  BL21(DE3)pLysS (Invitrogen) was 
used for overproduction of the protein. The 
yvaP  coding sequence was amplified by PCR 
using primers yvaP-PRSET-for and yvaP-PRSET-rev (Tab. S2). The PCR products 
were digested with EcoRI and BamHI 
restriction enzymes and inserted into the expression plasmid pRS ETA containing the 
codons for six N-terminal
 histidine residues 
that was digested with the same enzymes to 
generate pRSET yvaP . The yvaP sequence 
was verified by DNA sequencing. E. coli  CatR (YvaP)   57   Huyen et al., 2008a  
 BL21(DE3)pLysS carrying pRSET yvaP  was 
cultured in 1 L LB medium, and IPTG 
(isopropyl- β-D-thiogalactopyranoside) (final 
concentration, 1 mM) was added at the mid-
log phase (OD 600 of 0.8). Recombinant His-
tagged protein (His 6-YfiE) was expressed in 
E. coli  at least 2h after the addition of 1 mM 
IPTG and purified by Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid 
chelate affinity chromatography under native 
conditions according to the standard 
procedures of the manu facturer (Qiagen). The 
purified YvaP protein was extensively dialyzed against buffer B (25 mM Tris-HCl 
[pH8.0], 100 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM 
MgCl
2, 10% glycerol) and stored at -80 °C. 
DNase I footprinting analysis  
Primer yfiD-FT-for2 and yfiD-PE2 were each 
5’-end labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Diag nostics) and 50 µCi 
[γ32P]-ATP (GE Healthcare) and purified 
using ethanol precipitation. DNA probes for 
catE (corresponding to positions -114 to +67 
relative to TSS) were  synthesized by PCR 
amplification using one 5’ end-labeled primer 
(yfiD-FT-for2 or yfiD-FT-PE2) and the corresponding non-labeled primer, 
respectively (Tab. S2). Purified PCR 
fragments that are labele d at one 5’ end were 
used as sequencing templates. DNA probe purification and DNase I footprinting was performed as described previously (Töwe et 
al., 2007).  
DNA gel mobility shift assays   
DNA fragments containing the catD  promoter 
region were generated by PCR using the 
primer sets yfiD-FT- for2 and yfiD-FT-PE2. 
Approximately 600 pmol of the purified PCR products were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Diagnostics) 
and 50 µCi [ γ
32P]-ATP (GE Healthcare). The 
labeled DNA probes were purified by 
precipitation and 20000 cpm of each probe 
was incubated with different amounts of 
purified YvaP protein for 30 min at room 
temperature in EMSA-binding buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 0.1mM EDTA, 5mM MgCl
2, 0.5mM DTT, 10% 
glycerol) in the presence of 0.5 mg of BSA 
ml-1 and 0.05 mg of poly(dI-dC) ml-1. 
Concentrations of the compounds used for the DNA binding reactions were 1-20 mM MHQ, 
2-50 mM catechol, 1-10 mM diamide, 1-100 
mM H
2O2. Samples were separated by 5% 
native polyacrylamide ge l electrophoresis in 
10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA buffer, pH 8 at 
10°C and constant voltage (150V) for 6 
hours. Gels were dried and the radiolabeled bands were visualized using phosphoimaging.  
FT-ICR-MS analysis  
LC-ESI MS experiments were performed 
using an LTQ (linear ion
 trap) FTICR mass 
spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corp., San 
Jose, CA). The SEQUEST algorithm Version 
27.12 (Thermo Electron Corp.) was used to 
search for modifications of the YvaP tryptic peptides. A
 mass deviation of 0.01 Da for 
precursor ions as well as for fragment ions 
and one missed cleavage site of trypsin were allowed.
 The search result was filtered using 
BioWorks 3.2 (Thermo Electron Corp.). A 
multiple threshold filter applied at the peptide level
 consisted of the following criteria: ( a) 
peptide sequence length: 7–30 amino acids; 
(b) RSp 
 4; (c) percentage of ions: 70 (70% of 
all theoretical b- and y- ions of a peptide are 
experimentally found); ( d) Xcorr versus  
charge state: 1.90 for singly charged ions, 
2.20 for doubly charged ions and 3.75 for triply charged
 ions.

 Running title: Regulation of carbonyl 
detoxification by YraB (AdhR) in B. subtilis  
 
Key words:   
Bacillus subtilis /thiol stress/aldehydes/AdhR/ 
AdhA/YraA 
SUMMARY 
Quinones and α,β-unsaturated carbonyls 
are naturally occurring electrophilic 
compounds that target cysteine residues 
via thiol-(S)-alkylation. We analyzed the 
global expression profile of Bacillus subtilis  
to the toxic carbonyls methylglyoxal (MG) and formaldehyde (FA). Both carbonyl compounds induce a stress response characteristic for thiol-reactive electrophiles as revealed by the induction of the Spx, CtsR, CymR, PerR, YodB, 
ArsR, CzrA and CsoR regulons. MG and 
FA triggered also a SOS response which indicates DNA damage. Protection against FA is mediated by both the hxlAB  operon, 
encoding the ribulose monophosphate pathway for FA fixation, and a thiol-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (AdhA) and DJ-1/PfpI-family cysteine proteinase (YraA). The adhA-yraA  operon 
and the yraC  gene that encodes a γ-
carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase are 
positively regulated by the MerR-family regulator, YraB (AdhR). The upstream sequences of adhA, yraC and adhR  
contained typical MerR-like promoter sequences with a 7-4-7 inverted repeat (CTTAAAG-N
4-CTTTAAG) between the -
35 and -10 elements. Electrophoretic 
mobility-shift experiments revealed 
specific binding activity of AdhR to its 
target promoters. Mutational analyses showed that activation of adhA-yraA  
transcription requires the conserved Cys52 
of AdhR in vivo . We speculate that AdhR is 
redox-regulated via thiol-(S)-alkylation by 
aldehydes and that AdhA and YraA are 
specifically involved in reduction of 
aldehydes and degradation or repair of damaged thiol-containing proteins in B. 
subtilis, respectively.  
INTRODUCTION
 
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced 
as an unavoidable consequence of the aerobic lifestyle (Imlay, 2002). The oxidants 
generated from incomplete O
2 reduction can 
react with cellular com ponents, such as amino 
acids, carbohydrates or lipids, to produce a 
range of unstable oxidation products that 
break down to diffusible electrophiles (Marnett et al. , 2003; Farmer and Davoine, 
2007). These secondary oxidants include α,β-
unsaturated aldehydes whic h are of particular 
importance since these have two sites of reactivity, which can lead to the formation of cyclic adducts or cross-links. Thus, eukaroytic and prokaryo tic cells have evolved AdhR (YraB)                                                   64                                                  Huyen et al., 2008b  
 defense mechanisms to detoxify ROS and 
reactive electrophiles, and to repair the resulting damage.  
Redox-sensing transcrip tion factors respond 
to changes in the cellu lar redox status, caused 
either directly by ROS or as consequence of 
oxidized reactive intermediates which act as 
electrophiles. Such redox-sensing proteins 
often have conserved cysteine residues that serve as a primary target for oxidative or covalent modifications . The thiol group of 
cysteine can undergo either reversible modification, such as disulfide bond formation, or irreversible modifications 
including oxidation to cysteine sulfinic or sulfonic acids or thiol-(S)-alkylation (Giles et 
al., 2003; Marnett et al. , 2003; Barford, 2004; 
Satoh and Lipton, 2007). The reaction of 
electrophilic quinones, hydroquinones and 
α,β-unsaturated carbonyls involves a 1,4-
reductive nucleophilic addition of thiols to 
quinones (Michael-type addition) (O`Brian, 1991; Monks et al. , 1992; Kumagai et al. , 
2002; Marnett et al. , 2003). Thiol-(S)-
alkylation can function in redox signaling as first discovered in human neuronal cells 
where it regulates transc ription in response to 
electrophiles (Satoh and Lipton, 2007).  
Electrophiles can protect neurons through 
activation of the Keap-Nfr2 pathway resulting in the induction of the phase-2 antioxidant enzymes which include glutathione reductase 
and quinone oxidoreductase. Neuroprotective electrophiles react with specific cysteine residues in the Cys-rich regulatory Keap1 protein via thiol-(S)-alkylation which in turn 
liberates the transcription factor Nfr2. Nfr2 is translocated to the nucleus where it activates transcription of antioxidant enzymes (Holtzclaw et al. , 2004; Wakabayashi et al. , 
2004; Dinkova-Kostova et al. , 2005; Satoh et 
al., 2006; Satoh and Lipton, 2007).  
We have recently discovered a similar redox-regulated system in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis  which regulates 
the response to quinone- like electrophiles and 
diamide (Töwe  et al. , 2007; Antelmann et al. , 
2008; Leelakriangsak et al. , 2008). Quinones 
react with thiol-containing proteins in vivo  via 
thiol-(S)-alkylation leading to protein crosslinking and a ggregation (Liebeke  et al. , 
2008). B. subtilis  expresses an adaptive 
response to electrophile-stress that is 
mediated, in part, by two MarR-type 
repressors YodB and MhqR. Inactivation of 
these repressors by quinones or diamide leads to the expression of quinone or azo-
compound reductases and thiol-specific 
dioxygenases. The MarR/DUF24-family 
repressor YodB is alkylated in vitro  at the 
conserved Cys6 residue and this residue was essential for repression also in vivo .  
Besides quinone compounds, α,β-unsaturated 
aldehydes are highly toxic natural 
electrophiles, which are generated from oxidation of amino acids, lipids and carbohydrates (Marnett et al. , 2003; Farmer 
and Davoine, 2007).  Quinone compounds 
and α,β-unsaturated aldehydes both  react 
with cysteine thiols via
 the Michael addition 
mechanism. Methylglyoxal (MG) is the most 
studied toxic natural α-oxoaldehyde and is 
produced from triose-phosphate intermediates 
as a by-product of glycolysis, and also from 
amino acids and acetone (Ferguson et al. , 
1998; Booth et al. , 2003; Kalapos, 2008). MG 
reacts with nucleophilic centers of DNA, 
RNA and with the side chains of the amino acids arginine, lysine and cysteine. The reaction of MG with arginine and lysine residues results in the formation of the widely studied advanced glycation end-products (AGE), such as argpyrimidine or MG-cross-
linked lysine dimers (MOLD) (Oya et al. , 
1999; Bourajjaj et al. , 2003). The major 
protective mechanism against the deleterious effects of MG in Escherichia coli  is the 
spontaneous reaction of MG with glutathione 
(GSH) to form the he mithiolacetal, followed 
by isomerization to S-lactoylglutathione and 
conversion to D-lactate by the glyoxalase I and II enzymes (Ferguson  et al. , 1998; Booth 
et al. , 2003) (Fig. 1A).  
Formaldehyde (FA) is another highly toxic 
carbonyl compound and causes protein-protein and prot ein-DNA cross-links  in vivo  
(Orlando et al. , 1997). Like MG, FA reacts as 
an electrophile with the side chains of arginine and lysine. Since FA is a key intermediate in the metabolism of C
1AdhR (YraB)                                                   65                                                  Huyen et al., 2008b

Fig. 1.  Thiol-dependent detoxification pathways for methylglyoxal (A) and formaldehyde (B) in bacteria. (A) MG 
reacts spontaneously with glutathi one (GSH) to form hemithiolacetal , followed by isomerization to S-
lactoylglutathione by the glyoxalase I enzyme. S-lactoylgluta thione is substrate for the glyoxalase II enzyme and is 
converted to D-lactate and free GSH. Th is scheme is adapted from Ferguson et al.  (1998). (B) In prokaryotes and 
eukaryotes, FA is detoxified by glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenases (FDH) (Harms et al. , 1996). FA 
reacts spontaneously and reversible with GSH to form S- hydroxymethylglutathione. FDH- like enzymes such as class 
III alcohol dehydrogenases catalyze the NAD-dependent oxidation of S-hydroxymethylglutathione into S-
formylglutathione (Jensen et al. , 1998). This GSH thiol ester is reversibly hydrolyzed by a S-formylglutathione 
hydrolase to GSH and formiate.   This scheme is adapted from Jensen et al.  (1998).  
compounds in methanotrophic and 
methylotrophic bacteria, it is ubiquitously distributed in the environment. Thus, 
prokaryotes and eukaryotes have evolved 
conserved pathways for FA detoxification. 
These include glutathione-dependent 
formaldehyde dehydrogenases (FDH) which are conserved in all ki ngdoms of life (Harms 
et al. , 1996). FDH catalyzes the NAD-
dependent oxidation of S-hydroxymethylglutathione into S-formylglutathione. This GSH thiol ester is reversibly hydrolyzed by a S-formylglutathione hydrolase to GSH and 
formate (Jensen et al. , 1998) (Fig. 1B). In 
addition, the ribulose monophosphate pathway (RuMP), used for FA fixation in methylotrophs, is involved in FA detoxification in many non-methylotrophs including B. subtilis (Yurimoto et al. , 2005; Kato et al. , 2006). 3-Hexulose-6-phosphate 
synthase and 6-phosph o-3-hexuloisomerase, 
the key enzymes in the RuMP pathway, are 
encoded by the hxlAB  operon in B. subtilis . 
Interestingly, the hxlAB  operon is positively 
regulated by the MarR/DUF24 family protein  
HxlR which is closely related (39% sequence identity) to the quinone-responsive YodB repressor (Yurimoto et al. , 2005; 
Leelakriangsak et al. , 2008).  
In this study, we have applied genome-wide transcriptome and proteome profiling to study the adaptive response of  B. subtilis  to the 
toxic electrophiles MG and FA. Both 
compounds are strongly  thiol-reactive and 
they induced a genetic response superficially 
similar to that seen with quinones and diamide. In addition, FA and MG strongly induced the adhA-yraA  operon encoding a 
conserved formaldehyde dehydrogenase and a AdhR (YraB)                                                   66                                                  Huyen et al., 2008b  
 cysteine proteinase of the DJ1/PfpI family. 
This operon is controll ed by the novel MerR-
family regulator YraB which belongs to a 
sub-family of MerR/NmlR-like proteins 
which control adhA -like target genes. 
According to this co nserved regulation of 
adh-like genes we rename yraB  as adhR . This 
adhA-yraA  operon, along with the hxlAB  
operon, confers resistance to FA. Finally, we show that the conserved Cys52 residue of AdhR is essential for activation of transcription in response to electrophilic carbonyls in vivo .  
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
B. subtilis tolerates high concentrations of  
FA and MG  
Firstly, we tested the tolerance of B. subtilis  
wild type cells to MG and FA to define 
concentrations which cause growth-inhibition 
but are sub-lethal. Accordingly, B. subtilis  
wild type cells were grown in Belitsky 
minimal medium to an OD
500 of 0.4 and 
treated with 0.5-10 mM FA and 1.4-11.2 mM 
MG. The growth curves and survival ratios 
for FA and MG are shown in Fig. 2A and 2B, 
respectively. As noticed for other bacteria, B. 
subtilis  was able to tolerate high doses of FA 
without any killing e ffect (Fig. 2A). The 
treatment of B. subtilis  cells with 1-2 mM FA 
caused a decreased growth rate but did not affect the number of viable counts. The number of viable coun ts was significantly 
decreased by 5 mM FA indicating that this 
concentration is toxic for B. subtilis .  
In response to MG challenge, the growth rate 
of wild type cells was slightly reduced by concentrations of 1.4  mM and inhibited by 
2.8 mM, but without loss of viability (Fig. 
2B). However, toxic effects of MG were observed after exposure to 5.6 mM MG. The tolerance level of B. subtilis  t o  F A  i s  
comparable to that of Pseudomonas putida , 
Escherichia coli  or other bacilli  which were 
able to withstand simila r doses of FA without 
killing effects (Roca et al. , 2007). This is 
consistent with the demonstration that B. 
subtilis  is able to detoxify FA probably via the RuMP pathway encoded by the hxlAB  
operon (Yurimoto et al. , 2005; Kato et al. , 
2006). It is presently not clear if B. subtilis  is 
able to detoxify MG via specific pathways 
related to the glyoxalase system of  E. coli .  
Global responses to MG and FA are 
similar to those with other thiol-reactive 
electrophiles  
Based on the physiological data reported 
above, we decided to analyze the global 
response of B. subtilis  to concentrations of 
FA and MG which are growth-inhibitory. B. 
subtilis  was exposed to 1 mM FA, 2.8 mM 
MG, or 5.6 mM MG, labeled for 5 min with 
35S-methionine and subjected to proteome 
analysis (Fig. 3). The proteome results 
showed the induction of specific marker 
proteins ClpE, ClpC, CysK, YrhB, YxeP, 
YxeK, TrxB, NfrA, YqiG and YugJ by both carbonyl compounds. However, these marker proteins are induced  only by the higher 
concentration of 5.6 mM MG which reduced also the number of viab le counts (Fig. 1B). 
These marker proteins indicate the induction 
of the CtsR, CymR and Spx-regulons in B. 
subtilis  which were previously shown to be 
induced by thiol-reactive compounds diamide, catechol and methylhydroquinone 
(MHQ) (Antelmann et al. , 2008). Spx is a 
global transcriptional re gulator that controls 
genes that function in maintenance of thiol-homeostasis under conditions of electrophile stress such as the thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase encoding trxA and trxB genes 
(Zuber, 2004). Derepression of spx in 
response to thiol-react ive electrophiles is 
controlled by the oxidative stress specific repressor PerR (Mongkolsuk and Helmann, 2002) and the DUF24/MarR-type repressor YodB (Leelakriangsak  et al. , 2007). CtsR 
controls the Clp protea ses which are involved 
in repair or degradation of damaged or misfolded proteins. The cysteine metabolism
 
repressor CymR controls sulfur metabolism 
operons and several pathways leading to 
cysteine formation (Even et al ., 2006). 
Together the induction of the Spx, CtsR and 
CymR regulons by thiol-reactive electrophiles AdhR (YraB)                                                   67                                                  Huyen et al., 2008b

were up-regulated and 71 genes were downregulated (Tab. S1 and S2). The treatment with 2.8 mM and 5.6 mM MG resulted in induction of 230 genes and repression of 188 genes (Tab. S1 and S2). All genes and proteins that were induced by FA 
and/or MG treatment in three biological replicates are listed in Tab. S1 and sorted according to the known stress regulons in B. 
subtilis .  
The microarray results verified that both carbonyl compounds cause most prominently the induction of the CtsR, Spx, CymR and PerR regulons in B. subtilis . However, in 
accordance with the proteome results, only the growth-inhibitory concentration of 5.6 mM MG caused induction of these thiol-stress responsive regulons. Remarkably, exposure of cells to FA induced the CtsR, Spx and CymR regulons at  ratios that exceed 
those observed for ot her thiol-reactive 
compounds such as diamide, catechol and MHQ (Leichert et al. , 2003; Tam et al. , 2006; 
Duy et al. , 2007). For example, clpE was more than 100-fold upregulated in the 
transcriptome experiments by FA. We also noted maximal derepression ratios for almost 
all CymR regulon genes by FA. 
Transcriptional induction of selected genes and operons controlled by CtsR, Spx and CymR was verified us ing Northern blot 
analyses (Fig. 4).  The thiol-reactive nature of MG is further supported by the induction of the YodB regulon genes yodC , spx and azoR1  which 
encode quinone-resistance determinants. However, the induction of the YodB regulon 
genes was lower with MG treatment than 
previously noted for quinone compounds or diamide. YodB was shown to be redox-regulated via thiol-(S)-alkylation by quinone 
compounds in vitro  (Leelakriangsak et al. , 
2008). In addition, the ykvN  and yybR  genes 
encode two further MarR/DUF24-family regulators that respond to MG and quinone-compounds. Finally, the yfiDE (catDE ) 
operon was induced by MG and quinones that encodes a thiol-dependent catechol-2,3-dioxygenase and is regulated by another MarR/DUF24 paralog (YvaP) which we renamed as CatR in B. subtilis  (H. Antelmann 
and coworkers, unpublished data). Thus, we hypothesize that elect rophilic carbonyl 
compounds react with regulatory thiols of several distinct redox-sensing transcription factors. AdhR (YraB)                                                   68                                                  Huyen et al., 2008b

Fig. 3.  Dual-channel images of the protein synthesis pattern of B. subtilis  wild type before (green image) and 10 
min after the exposure to 5.6 mM MG (A , red image) or 1 mM FA (B, red image).  Cytoplasmic proteins were 
labeled with L-[35S] methionine and separated by 2D PAGE as described in Materials and Methods. Image analysis of 
the autoradiograms was performed using the Decodon Delta 2- D software. Proteins that ar e synthesized at increased 
levels in response to FA or MG stress in at least two independent experiments are indicated by red labels. Their 
respective induction ratios are listed in Tab. S1. Spot identification was performed using MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometry from coomassie-stained 2D gels as described in the Methods section. 
FA and MG also induced the PerR peroxide-
stress regulon. The transcriptional induction of katA by MG and FA was verified using 
Northern blot experiments (Fig. 4). However, 
in the proteome experiments we observed induction of MrgA but not KatA, AhpC and 
AhpF. The induction of the PerR regulon by 
FA and MG could indica te that electrophilic 
carbonyl and quinone compounds produce 
ROS (Mongkolsuk and Helmann, 2002). Quinone compounds can undergo redox-cycling reactions leadin g to the generation of 
semiquinone anions and ROS (O`Brian, 
1991). MG has been shown to provoke free 
radical generation involving ROS and RNS as 
well as organic methylglyoxal radicals or cross-linked methylglyoxal radicals which contribute also to MG toxicity mechanisms in eukaryotic cells (Kalapos, 2008). Similarly, FA causes cross-links between protein and DNA which results in the generation of secondary electrophiles which in turn could lead to ROS production (Orlando et al. , 1997). It is also possible that PerR 
derepression is elic ited by the reaction of 
aldehydes with functi onally important Cys 
residues in PerR. However, the four Cys 
residues in PerR coordinate a tightly bound zinc ion and are known to be generally non-reactive with peroxides (Lee and Helmann, 
2006). Thus, it seems unlikely that they 
would react strongly with electrophilic aldehydes, although this requires further testing. FA and MG also induced the DNA damage responsive SOS (LexA) regulon. DNA 
damage likely results from the known ability 
of FA and MG to cause protein-DNA cross-
links, for example between the amino groups of lysine and cytosine (Orlando et al. , 1997). 
These upregulated SOS regulon genes include the DNA repair and recombination systems uvrB , uvrC and recA  and also a DNA 
alkylation repair enzyme, yhaZ . Similar

Fig. 4. Transcriptional analysis of selected genes that are strongly induced in the microarray analyses by FA and 
MG. Transcript analysis of clpE, nfrA, cysK , arsB and katA indicates the induction of th e CtsR, Spx, CymR, ArsR and 
PerR-dependent thiol-specific stress responses by FA an d MG, which overlaps with th e response to diamide and 
quinone-like electrophiles (Antelmann et al. , 2008). Transcription of the HxlR-controlled hxlAB  operon is specifically 
induced by aldehydes. The formate dehydrogenase operon yrhED  and the formate transporter operon yrhFG-yrzI  
respond specifically to MG but not to FA. The arrows point toward the size of the specific transcripts. 
enzymes were also shown in genome-wide 
expression profiling for FA in  P. putida  
(Roca et al. , 2007).   
As has been shown also for diamide and 
quinones, several cation efflux systems were strongly up-regulated by carbonyl stress 
including the ArsR-dependent arsR-yqcK-
arsBC  operon required for resistance to 
As(III), Sb(III), Cd(II) and Ag(I) (Moore et 
al., 2005). The induction of this ars operon 
by FA and MG stress was also verified in Northern blot experiments (Fig. 4). In addition, the CzrA-dependent cation diffusion facilitator encoding czcDtrkA operon that 
responds to Zn(II), Cd (II), Cu, Ni(II) and 
Co(II) is induced by MG and FA. Finally, the 
CsoR-regulated copZA  operon which is 
activated by Cu(II) (Smaldone and Helmann, 2007) also belongs to the metal ion responsive systems that is induced by MG and FA. We speculate that the induction of these metal efflux systems by electrophilic 
carbonyls is an adventit ious consequence of 
the fact that these systems are regulated by 
metal-sensing repressors  that have exposed 
cysteine residues as part of their metal-
binding sites (Morby et al. , 1993; Harvie et 
al., 2006; Liu et al. , 2007; Chen and He, 
2008).  Finally, many genes of the SigmaD regulon that are involved in motility, chemotaxis and 
cell wall turnover were up-regulated by aldehyde treatment (Serizawa et al. , 2004). 
These include the flgKLM , fliDST  and motAB  
operons for assembly of flagella and different 
methyl-accepting chemotaxis genes 
(mcpABC , tlpAB , yfmS , yoaH  and yvaQ ). The 
induction of the SigmaD regulon has been observed also in response to quinone compounds such as MHQ (Duy et al. , 2007 ). 
To visualize the overlapping expression of genes and regulons that respond to all AdhR (YraB)                                                   70                                                  Huyen et al., 2008b  
 analyzed thiol-reactive compounds, we 
performed a hierarchical  clustering analysis 
using transcriptomic data of B. subtilis  cells 
exposed to diamide (Leichert et al. , 2003), 
MHQ (Duy et al. , 2007), catechol (Tam et al. , 
2006), MG and FA (Fig. 5). For the cluster 
analysis, we have chosen a subset of 271 
genes which are more than 4-fold induced by 
either of these thiol-reactive electrophiles or known to be coregulated with these strongly induced genes. The complete cluster shows 9 major groups of genes which are arranged as nodes with similar expression profiles. The common induction of the thiol stress specific 
CtsR, Spx, CymR, ArsR and CzrA regulons as well as the SigmaD regulon by all thiol-reactive electrophiles is  shown in nodes 6, 7, 
2 and 3. The induction of genes regulated by 
PerR, YodB, YvaP (CatR) and MhqR seems 
to be more specific for quinones and diamide than for FA and MG (nodes 4 and 10). In contrast, FA and MG lead to selective induction of the HxlR, AdhR and LexA regulons (node 5). Although exposure to FA  and MG elicits a 
genetic response similar in many ways to other thiol-reactive compounds, there are 
some genes that were induced specifically by 
MG only. These included the yrhED  operon 
which encodes the putative formate 
dehydrogenase YrhE and the yrhFG-yrzI  
operon encoding the putative formate transporter YrhG. The specific induction of the yrhED and yrhFG-yrzI  operons can be 
also visualized in node 1 of the cluster analysis (Fig. 5). Northern blot analyses using a yrhG  specific showed RNA probe revealed 
two separate transcripts of 1.3 and 2.0 kb which could indicate that the yrhFG-yrzI  
transcript is subject to RNA processing (Fig. 
4). We suspected that the specific induction of two operons involved in formate metabolism ( yrhED  and yrhFG-yrzI ) by MG 
could be caused by contamination of commercially available MG with formate (Kalapos, 1999). Howeve r, our quantitative 
NMR analysis of the commercially available MG revealed a composition of 88% MG, 1.7% acetic acid, 2.1% methanol and 4.7% propandiol but no formate (data not shown). Carbonyl stress specifically induces the 
HxlR-controlled hxlAB  operon and the 
AdhR-regulated adhA -yraA  operon    
Our cluster analysis revealed also a small 
subset of genes that were selectively induced by both carbonyls (FA and MG) but not by other thiol-reactive electrophiles. These genes 
include the known members of the HxlR 
regulon (Yurimoto et al. , 2005; Kato et al. , 
2006) and genes identified here as controlled by the AdhR activator protein. One of the major routes for FA detoxification is the RuMP pathway which is encoded by the hxlAB  operon that is positively controlled 
HxlR (Yurimoto et al. , 2005; Kato et al. , 
2006). We observed very high induction of 
this hxlAB  operon (20-140-fold) and the 
autoregulatory hxlR gene (3-10-fold) by both 
MG and FA. The induction of the hxlAB  
operon was also verified  using Northern blots 
(Fig. 4) and the HxlA protein was identified as specific marker protein for FA and MG stress in the proteome (Fig. 3).   We also observed very high and specific-induction (10-40-fold) of the adhA  gene  after 
FA and MG treatment. The adhA  gene 
encodes a NADH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (Tab. S1) similar to 
glutathione-dependent formaldehyde 
dehydrogenases (FDH) which are evolutionarily conser ved among prokaryotic 
and eukaryotic organisms (Harms et al. , 
1996). Furthermore, this class of FDH-like enzymes has conserved S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) reductase activity and functions in S-nitrosothiol homeostasi s and protects against 
nitrosative stress in E. coli, Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae  and mouse macrophages (Liu et 
al., 2001). In contrast, B. subtilis  AdhA was 
induced specifically by FA and MG, but not 
under conditions of nitrosative stress (Moore et al. , 2004). We hypothesize that AdhA 
functions in the thiol-dependent 
detoxification of aldehydes. In addition to 
adhA , we observed induction of the yraB  and 
yraC  genes which are encoded upstream of 
adhA .  
The yraC  gene was removed from the 
SubtiList database (previous accession number BG 13778) but is still included in our AdhR (YraB)                                                   71                                                  Huyen et al., 2008b

Fig. 5. Hierarchical clustering analysis of ge ne expression in response to electrophiles in B. subtilis . The treatment 
with the electrophiles includes diamide (Dia), catechol (Cat), methylhydroquinone (MHQ), formaldehyde (FA) and 
methylglyoxal (MG).  Genes expression data were clustered based on the expression level leading to 9 defined groups 
(nodes). Nodes enriched for genes that belong to the Ct sR, Spx, CymR, PerR, ArsR, Cz rA, YodB, CatR (YvaP), MhqR,

microarrays. Since the yraC  transcript is 
strongly induced by aldehydes in the 
transcriptome, we ha ve reannotated the yraC  
gene as 192 bp open reading frame which 
could encode a putative 64 aa protein product 
with similarity to γ-carboxymuconolactone 
decarboxylases (CMD) (Fig. S1). These 
CMD domain enzymes are involved in protocatechuate catabolism and in some bacteria a gene fusion event leads to expression of CMD with a hydrolase involved in the same pathway (Eulberg et al. , 1998). 
Recently, it was reported that an enzyme annotated as CMD in Methanosarcina 
acetivorans  had protein disulfide reductase 
activity which depend s on a CxxC motif 
(Lessner and Ferry, 2007). However, this CxxC motif is not c onserved in YraC. CMD-
like domains are also found in the alkylhydroperoxide reductase AhpD of 
mycobacteria (Bryk et al. , 2002). We also 
noticed that YraC is much smaller than other 
annotated CMD family enzymes (Fig. S1B), and thus the function of YraC is still unknown.  The yraB  gene encodes a MerR-family  AdhR (YraB)                                                   72                                                  Huyen et al., 2008b

regulator related to proteins which often 
regulate divergently transcribed adhA -like 
genes. Since we here show that YraB 
regulates induction of adhA , we renamed 
YraB as AdhR. Interestingly, NmlR, an 
AdhR-homolog of Neisseria gonorrhoeae,  is 
a redox-controlled regulator of the GSNO 
reductase AdhC, a Cpx-type ATPase and a 
thioredoxin reductase, and protects against nitric oxide (NO) stress (Kidd et al. , 2005).  
NmlR-like regulators form a distinct subfamily among the MerR family and all regulate the expression of adh-like genes 
(Kidd et al. , 2007; Stroeher et al. , 2007). In 
addition, these MerR-type regulators have 
conserved roles in protection against NO stress also in Haemophilus influenzae  and 
Pneumococcus  (Kidd et al. , 2007; Stroeher et 
al., 2007). Unlike other MerR-type 
regulators, NmlR and AdhR lack the conserved Cys residues present in metal-responsive MerR-type regulators. Instead, 
these NmlR homologues (including AdhR) all share the conserved Cys52 residue ( B. subtilis  
numbering) that could pl ay a role in sensing 
of aldehydes. However, the detailed mechanisms of transcriptional regulation for NmlR-like regulators under conditions of NO 
or FA stress has thus fa r not been described.   
The MerR/NmlR-type regulator AdhR 
positively regulates the adhA-yraA  operon 
and yraC  in response to electrophilic 
aldehydes   
The adhA  gene is located upstream of the 
yraA  gene which encodes a member of the 
DJ-1/PfpI-family of proteins, some of which may function as cysteine proteinases (Wei et 
al., 2007). Although their functions are not 
well understood, there is a wealth of 
structural information for DJ-1/PfpI family 
members and structures have been determined for human DJ-1, yeast Hsp31p, and four E. coli  homologs YhbO, SCRP 27a, 
YajL and Hsp31. The structures of these proteins are similar; they all possess a conserved Cys residue in the nucleophile 
elbow motif. Recently, Hsp31p has been shown to be involved in the protection against ROS (Skoneczna et al. , 2008). Interestingly, 
yraA  is under complex cont rol. In addition to 
its induction as part of the bicistronic adhA-
yraA  operon (controlled by AdhR), it is also AdhR (YraB)                                                   73                                                  Huyen et al., 2008b  
 very strongly up-regulated under thiol-
specific stress conditions as part of the Spx regulon (Nakano et al. , 2003). Expression of 
yraA  by Spx is independent of the upstream 
adhA  gene (Eiamphungporn and Helmann, 
2008).  
To study the regulation and transcriptional 
organization of adhA , we performed Northern 
blot experiments using RNA isolated from B. 
subtilis  wild type and adhR  mutant cells after 
exposure to FA and MG. Hybridization was 
performed using adhA, yraA  and adhR -
specific RNA probes (Fig. 6A). Two transcripts were detected using a yraA -
specific RNA probe, both of which were 
strongly elevated under conditions of aldehyde stress in the w ild type. The larger 
1.8 kb transcript co rresponds to the adhA-
yraA  bicistronic transcript  which is absent in 
the adhR  mutant. The smaller 0.5 kb 
transcript originates from a promoter that precedes yraA  and is induced in both the wild 
type and adhR  mutant strain. Thus, 
transcription of yraA  is induced 
monocistronically in a Spx-dependent manner and as part of the bicistronical AdhR-controlled adhA-yraA  message. This positive 
regulation of the adhA-yraA  operon by AdhR 
was verified also by using an adhA -specific 
RNA probe. In this case, only the AdhR-dependent up-regulation of the 1.8 kb adhA-
yraA  transcript was detected, but not the yraA  
specific monocistronic transcript. Finally, 
using a adhR -specific RNA probe, the 
autoregulation of adhR  was verified by 
Northern blot analyses.  Next, we used in silico  analyses to identify 
conserved binding sites for the AdhR regulator upstream of adhA  and adhR . A 
conserved 7-4-7 invert ed repeat with the 
consensus sequence CTTAAAG-N4-CTTTAAG was identified in the promoter regions of adhA  and adhR . This consensus 
was used to search the genome sequence of B. 
subtilis  using the search pattern function of 
the SubtiList database. In addition to the adhA  and adhR  promoters, this conserved IR 
sequence was detected upstream of yraC  (Fig. 
6B). Transcription of yraC  was also induced under conditions of aldehyde stress as 
revealed by the microarray data.  The transcription start sites of  adhA, adhR,  
and yraC  were mapped using 5’ RACE 
experiments (Fig. 6B). The 5’ end of the adhR -specific mRNA was mapped at an A 
located 34 bp upstream of the start codon. 
The transcription start point for yraC  was 
mapped at G and C located 42 and 43 bp upstream of the ATG. Finally, the adhA-yraA  
specific message initiates with G or A residues located 82 and 83 bp upstream of the ATG start codon. The -10 and -35 elements of all three promoter regions were separated by 19 bp which is consistent with the elongated spacer regions typical for MerR-family regulators (Brown et al. , 2003; 
Hobman et al. , 2005). The conserved IR 
sequence overlapped slightly the -35 
promoter region which is typical for MerR-type regulators. These conserved binding sites and the MerR-type promoter architecture suggests that adhR, yraC  and adhA-yraA  
constitute the alde hyde-inducible AdhR

AdhR binds specifically to the adhA , adhR 
and yraC promoter regions   
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) 
were performed using purified His-tagged AdhR protein and the adhA, adhR  and yraC  
promoter regions. As shown in Fig. 7, high affinity DNA-AdhR comp lexes were detected 
for all target promoter  regions, but not for a 
control DNA fragment from the yoeB  
promoter region. Like other MerR family members, AdhR binds to its target operator sequences both with and without specific inducer and addition of MG or FA had little effect on the AdhR DNA binding activity. Similarly, the FA-responsive transcriptional activator HxlR (Yurimoto et al. , 2005) binds 
to its target operator sequences with similar affinities in the absence and presence of FA in vitro . HxlR shares similarity to the YodB 
repressor and 5 other MarR/DUF24-family members of B. subtilis . We have shown 
previously shown that  Cys6 of YodB is AdhR (YraB)                                                   74                                                  Huyen et al., 2008b

alkylated by quinone-like electrophiles in

Cys residue is also present in HxlR.  We note 
that all AdhR-homologs in the MerR/NmlR-
subfamily share a conserved Cys52 residue. Thus, we analyzed next the role of Cys52 in 
regulation of adhA-yraA  transcription by 
AdhR.  
Transcriptional activation of the adhA-
yraA  operon requires the conserved Cys52 
of AdhR To address the question whether the 
conserved Cys52 of AdhR is involved in regulation of adhA-yraA  transcription, we 
constructed adhR  mutant strain that 
ecotopically expresse d a functional FLAG-
tagged AdhR as well as the AdhRC52A 
mutant protein from a xylose-inducible 
promoter (P
xyl) based on the pSWEET 
plasmid (Bhavsar et al. , 2001). The adhR  and 
adhRC52A  complemented ΔadhR  mutant 
strains were grown in Belitsky minimal 
medium and expression of the P xyl promoter 
was induced by addition of 2% Xylose (Fig. 
8A). Since activation of adhA-yraA  AdhR (YraB)                                                   75                                                  Huyen et al., 2008b

transcription requires aldehydes, cells were 
treated with 2.8 mM MG or 1 mM FA for 10 
min after xylose addition and the isolated 
RNA were subjected to adhA -specific 
Northern blot analyses. The Northern blot 
results showed that adhA-yraA  transcription 
is similar strongly activat ed by MG and FA in 
wild type cells and in the adhR-FLAG  
complemented adhR  mutant strain (Fig. 8A). 
However, no expression of adhA-yraA  
transcription occurred in the adhRC52A  
mutant in response to aldehyde treatment. Western blot analyses  confirmed that FLAG-
AdhR and FLAG-AdhRC 52A proteins are 
produced in similar amounts in the adhR  and 
adhRC52A  complemented ΔadhR  mutant 
strains (Fig. 8B). These results indicate that 
Cys52 is required fo r the activation of 
transcription by AdhR, presumably because aldehydes modify this conserved Cys residue via thiol-(S)-alkylation to allosterically 
activate AdhR.  In contrast to AdhR, which acts as transcriptional activator for adhA  expression, 
the MerR/NmlR regulator of N. gonorrhoeae  
represses transcription of adhC  under normal 
conditions and adhC  transcription is 
derepressed in the nmlR  mutant (Kidd et al. , 2005). It has been further shown that 
repression by NmlR requires Zn(II) and transcription of adhC  was activated by the 
thiol reactive compound diamide. Mutation of 
any of the four conserved Cys residues in NmlR resulted in constitutive transcriptional repression and lack of activation of adhC  
transcription suggesting that NmlR acts as transcriptional repressor that responds to thiol 
stress conditions (Kidd et al. , 2005). 
The ΔhxlR,  ΔadhA and ΔyraAyfkM  
mutants are sensitive to FA stress  
Previous analyses showed that the ΔhxlR 
deletion mutant was sensitive to FA exposure 
(Yurimoto et al. , 2005). To determine to 
which extent the RuMP pathway and the FA dehydrogenase pathway confer resistance to carbonyl compounds, growth experiments 
were performed using  ΔhxlR, ΔadhR , ΔyraA  
and ΔadhA
 mutants. The results showed that 
the growth rates of the ΔhxlR and ΔadhA  
mutants were significantly reduced in the 
presence of 0.5 and 1 mM FA compared to wild type cells (Fig. 9). This indicates that 
both FA detoxification systems contribute to AdhR (YraB)                                                   76                                                  Huyen et al., 2008b

FA resistance of B. subtilis . However, neither  
of the tested mutants showed an increased  
sensitivity to methylglyoxal (data not shown). 
B. subtilis  also possesses another alcohol 
dehydrogenase encoded by the adhB  gene 
which is a part of the yraGF-adhB-yraED  
operon and shown previously to be under 
control of the sporulation sigma factor, σG 
(Steil et al. , 2005). However, the yraGF-
adhB-yraED  operon is also induced by FA 
and MG (3-8-fold) in microarray experiments 
(Tab. S1) which indicates that expression does not require the sporulation sigma factor, σ
G. Thus, we tested the growth of an 
ΔadhA ΔadhB  double mutant after exposure to 
FA and MG. The results showed no 
differences in the growth of the ΔadhA ΔadhB  
double mutant compared to the ΔadhA  single 
mutant in the presence of FA and MG (data 
not shown). Thus, adhB  does not contribute 
significantly to alde hyde resistance of 
growing B. subtilis  cells.  
The yraA  gene encodes a putative DJ-1/PfpI-
family cysteine proteinase. Phenotype analyses showed that the sensitivity of the 
ΔyraA  mutant was similar to the wild type 
after exposure to FA (data not shown). Since 
yraA  displays sequence similarity to the σ
B-
dependent yfkM  gene, we investigated the 
growth phenotype of the ΔyraA ΔyfkM double 
mutant after exposure to FA and MG stresses. 
The ΔyraA ΔyfkM  double mutant showed a 
reduced growth rate after treatment with FA 
and MG compared to the wild type and to the yraA  single mutant (Fig. 9). Thus, both 
putative DJ-1/PfpI-family cysteine proteinases can replace each other in protection against reactive aldehydes, 
presumably by repair or degradation of proteins with specifi c thiol-modifications. 
Previous transcriptome analyses have revealed that yraA  is most strongly induced in 
response to thiol-specific stress conditions, such as diamide, catechol and MHQ (Leichert et al. , 2003; Tam et al. , 2006; Duy et al. , 
2007). Expression of yraA  was also inducible 
by acid, ethanol and vancomycin and yraA  
mutant cells were sensitive to acid stress (Thackray and Moir, 2003; Jervis et al. , 
2007). In the case of othe r thiol-specific stress 
conditions or acid stress, induction of yraA  
occurs in a Spx-dependent manner 
(Eiamphungporn and Helmann, 2008). Recent studies further showed that the previously 
suggested σ
M-dependent expression of yraA  
is derived from the σM-dependent activation 
of spx (Nakano  et al. , 2003; Eiamphungporn 
and Helmann, 2008).  
According to the DJ-1/PfpI-family homology, YraA could function in repair or degradation 
of proteins that are damaged by electrophiles and related toxic compounds. However, according to previous studies, YraA had no 
detectable protease or chaperone activity (Thackray and Moir, 2003). In ongoing studies, we are using proteomic approaches and radioactively-labe led electrophiles to 
identify possible substr ates for the YraA and 
YfkM proteases in B. subtilis .  Together, our 
results show that B. subtilis  encodes multiple 
systems involved in re sistance to FA: the 
HxlR-regulated RuMP pathway and the 
AdhR-controlled thiol-dependent formaldehyde hydrogenase AdhA and   AdhR (YraB)                                                   77                                                  Huyen et al., 2008b

 The LMW thiol cysteine functions in 
detoxification of FA and MG  
In previous studies we found that the LMW 
thiol cysteine is decreased in the metabolome after treatment with qu inones. In addition, 
supplementation of the growth medium with extracellular cysteine protects cells against 
the lethal effect of electrophilic quinones (Liebeke et al. , 2008). This suggests that 
cysteine may function in detoxification of 
electrophiles.  The results of this study also suggest that cysteine is an important target for toxic aldehydes. Thus, we measured the intracellular concentration of cysteine in the metabolome after exposure to FA and MG using GC/MS analyses. Levels of cysteine were decreased about 5 -fold after exposure to 
0.5-1 mM FA and 5.5 mM MG in B. subtilis  
(Fig. 10A). In addition, and in contrast to quinone treatment, other metabolites were not changed by FA and MG exposure.  To determine if extracellular cysteine can protect cells against aldehyde toxicity, we pretreated cells with different concentrations of cysteine prior to FA  and MG challenge and monitored growth (Fig. 10B,C). These medium supplementation experiments revealed that wild type cells pretreated with 1-2 mM cysteine were protected against the 
toxicity of 2 mM FA an d growth was restored 
(Fig. 10B). Also, pretreat ment of cells with 3 
mM cysteine suppressed the growth 
inhibitory effect of 3 mM MG (Fig. 10C). 
These experiments showed that equimolar amounts of cysteine are able to titrate toxic aldehydes, consistent with the notion that electrophilic aldehydes ta rget cysteine (both 
free and in proteins) and that cysteine-dependent enzymes may function in detoxification. Intere stingly, benzoquinone 
(BQ) is toxic at concentrations of 10 µM and requires only 20 µM Cys for detoxification. Thus, much higher concen trations of cysteine 
are needed to titrate FA and MG compared to 
BQ. We used NMR analysis to test whether cysteine reacts in vitro  with FA and MG,. 
Indeed, FA reacts completely with cysteine resulting in a thiazo lidine carboxylic acid in 
vitro  (Fig. S2A). The reaction of MG with 
cysteine leads to genera tion of the acetylated 
derivative of the thiazo lidine carboxylic acid 
(Fig. S2B). 
The transcriptomic results revealed DNA 
damage by aldehydes which indicates that 
aldehydes also cause cr oss-links between the 
side chains of lysine or arginine and nucleic acids. However, unlike Cys, pretreatment of cells with arginine and lysine did not restore 
growth after addition of toxic MG or FA concentrations (data not shown). These 
results suggest that Cys is the strongest nucleophile which is targeted in vivo  by 
aldehydes.  
Conclusion    
In this study, we have analyzed the global 
response of B. subtilis  to the electrophilic 
carbonyls FA and MG. The global expression profiles suggest th at carbonyls act, like 
diamide and quinones, as thiol-reactive compounds which most probably target cysteine residues via the thiol-(S)-alkylation 
chemistry. Thus, cysteine is also one of the 
first barriers for el ectrophilic aldehydes as AdhR (YraB)                                                   78                                                  Huyen et al., 2008b

Fig. 10.   The LMW thiol cysteine protects against aldehyde toxicity in B. subtilis . (A)  Changes in the level of 
cysteine in the metabolome we re measured using GC-MS in B. subtilis  cellular extracts after exposure to FA and MG 
as described in Methods. Average values and standard deviations are quantified from at least three independent 
cultivation experiments and the ratios are related to the untreated control. (B, C)  B. subtilis  wild type cells were grown 
in Belitsky minimal medium to an OD of 0.4 and different c oncentrations of extracellular cy steine were added prior to 
exposure of FA (B) or MG (C). These experiments indicate that 1 mM cysteine  is able to protect against 2 mM FA and 
3 mM cysteine titrate 3 mM MG which restored the growth.  
supported by protection experiments with 
extracellular cysteine. However, in contrast to quinones and diamide, carbonyl electrophiles 
display also a unique ge netic response which 
is governed by the HxlR and AdhR 
regulators. Both the Hx lR and AdhR regulons 
confer resistance to FA. AdhR is 
characterized here as novel regulator of the MerR/NmlR-family which positively controls a conserved thiol-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (AdhA) and the putative cysteine protease YraA, both of which protect 
against FA toxicity. Transcriptional regulation by AdhR re quires the conserved 
Cys52 residue which we hypothesize is 
alkylated by elect rophilic carbonyl 
compounds leading to activation of the AdhR-dependent adhA-yraA , yraC  and adhR  
operons. Future studies ar e directed to define 
the nature of post-translational thiol-modifications which are caused by aldehydes in AdhR as well as in cellular proteins in vivo . 
These might involve S-hydroxymethylcysteine modifications or protein crosslinks be tween different thiol-
containing proteins by FA. These studies are 
likely to be challenging since these adducts may, like quinone-(S)-adducts, be unstable modifications poorly accessible by mass 
spectrometry approaches. 
Experimental procedures 
Bacterial strains and growth conditions 
The bacterial strains used were B. subtilis  168 
(trpC2 ) and CU1065 ( trpC2 ), ΔadhA  
(trpC2 ,adhA ::mls
r), ΔadhA ΔadhB  
(trpC2 ,adhA ::mlsradhB ::spcr), ΔyraA  
(trpC2 ,yraA ::cmr), ΔyraA ΔyfkM  
(trpC2 ,yraA ::cmryfkM ::mlsr), ΔadhR  
(trpC2 ,adhR ::kmr) which are described below. 
B. subtilis  strains were cultivated under 
vigorous agitation at 37°C in Belitsky 
minimal medium described previously 
(Stülke et al. , 1993). E. coli  strains were 
grown in LB for DNA manipulation. The antibiotics were used at the following 
concentrations: 1 µg/ml erythromycin, 25 
µg/ml lincomycin, 5 µg/ml chloramphenicol and 10 µg/ml kanamycin. Methylglyoxal was purchased from Sigma Aldrich and formaldehyde was ordered from Roth.  Gene deletions were generated using long-flanking-homology polymerase chain reaction 
(LFH-PCR) as previously described (Mascher et al., 2003). Primers used to amplify the up AdhR (YraB)                                                   79                                                  Huyen et al., 2008b  
 
 
Fig. S2. Reaction of FA (A) and MG (B) with cysteine was confirmed in vitro  using NMR spectroscopy. FA reacts 
with cysteine resulting in a thiazolidine carboxylic acid (A).  MG reacts with cysteine le ading to generation of the 
acetylated derivative of the thiazolidine carboxylic acid (B). NMR spectra were m easured as described in the Methods 
section. The spectra show the resonance signals for the protons  numbered for the substances in the reaction schemes. In 
particular, the NMR pattern of the CH 2 group at position 2” of the thiazolidine ring systems clearly shows the ring 
closure during the reactions of formaldehyde or methylglyoxa l with cysteine, respectively. The multiple signal of the 2’ 
CH 2 group in cysteine is divided to two quartet signals for both protons. A similar pattern was observed for the 
methylene group 3” in the carboxy-thiazo lidine formed by the carbon of FA. Th ese signals are not present in the case 
of the acetylated thiazolidine resulting from the reactio n of MG with cysteine. In that  case the newly formed acetyl CH 3 
group was clearly detected in the spectrum (position 3”).  AdhR (YraB)                                                   80                                                  Huyen et al., 2008b  
 and down fragments are listed in Tab. S3. 
Fragments were amplified using Pfu DNA 
polymerase (Stratagene) and were joined 
using Expand Long Template PCR System 
(Roche).  Five µl of the LFH-PCR product was introduced into the desired strain by transformation. Integration and deletion of the 
gene were confirmed by PCR. 
Construction of adhR mutant containing  
adhR -FLAG and adhR C52A-FLAG under  
PxylA  control was performed using the 
pSWEET plasmid (a derivative of pDG364 containing PxylA  promoter and 
chloramphenicol resistance gene) (Bhavsar et 
al., 2001). To generate pSWEET containing 
adhR -FLAG, adhR  gene which was fused in 
frame with FLAG epitope tag including the 
predicted RBS site upstream of adhR , but 
lacking the promoter was amplified by PCR using primers 4151/4152 as listed in Tab. S3. The resulting fragment was digested with PacI and BamHI and cloned into pSWEET that was digested with the same enzymes, placing in adhR -FLAG downstream of the 
PxylA  promoter. The pS WEET containing 
adhR C52A-FLAG was generated by PCR 
mutagenesis. Using pSWEET containing adhR -FLAG as a templa te, First-round PCR 
was performed in two separate reactions with primers 4151/4175 and 4152/4170 (Tab. S3). The PCR products were joined by a second round of PCR using primers 4151/4152. The product was digested with PacI and BamHI and cloned into pSWEET that was digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmids  were verified by DNA sequencing 
then digested with PstI and transformed into adhR::Km where fragments integrated into 
the amyE  locus. The resulting strains were 
selected by Km
rCmr and confirmed by PCR.   
Proteome analysis and mass spectrometry 
Cells grown in Belitsky minimal medium to 
an OD 500 of 0.4 were pulse-labeled for 5 min 
each with 5 µCi of L-[35S]methionine per ml 
before (control) and 10 min after exposure to 
1 mM FA, 2.8 mM or 5.6 mM MG. 
Preparation of cytoplasmic L-
[35S]methionine-labeled proteins and separation by two-dimensional gel 
electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) using the immobilized pH gradients (IPG) in the pH range 4-7 was performed as described (Tam et al., 2006). The quantitative image analysis 
was performed with the Decodon Delta 2D software (
http://www.decodon.com). Proteins 
showing an induction of  at least two-fold 
during the 5 min of L-[35S]methionine pulse 
in two independent experiments were 
considered as significantly induced. For 
identification of the proteins by mass 
spectrometry, nonradioactive protein samples 
of 200 µg were separated by 2-D PAGE and the 2D gels were stained with Colloidal 
Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Amersham 
Biosciences). Spot cutting, tryptic digestion of the proteins and spotting of the resulting 
peptides onto the MALDI-targets (Voyager 
DE-STR, PerSeptive Biosystems) were performed using the Ettan Spot Handling Workstation (Amersham-Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) as described previously (Eymann et al. , 2004). The MALDI-TOF-
TOF measurement of spotted peptide solutions was carried out on a Proteome-
Analyzer 4800 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) as described previously (Eymann et al. , 2004).  
Transcriptome analysis   
For microarray analysis, B. subtilis  wild type 
cells were grown in Belitsky minimal medium to OD
500 of 0.4 and harvested before 
and 10 min after exposure to 1 mM FA, 2.8 
mM and 5.6 mM MG, respectively. Total 
RNA was isolated by the acid phenol method 
as described (Majumdar et al . 1991). 
Generation of fluorescence-labeled cDNA and hybridization with B. subtilis  whole-
genome microarrays (Eurogentec) was performed as described previously (Jürgen et 
al., 2005). Genes showing induction or 
repression ratios of at least three-fold in three independent experiments were considered as significantly induced. The averages ratios and standard deviations for all induced or 
repressed genes are calculated from three independent transcript ome experiments after AdhR (YraB)                                                   81                                                  Huyen et al., 2008b  
 10 min of exposure to 2.8 and 5.6 mM MG or 
1 mM FA and listed in Tab. S4 and S5 (
http://microbio1.biologie.uni-
greifswald.de/publications.html). 
Hierarchical clustering analysis  
Clustering of gene expression profiles in 
response to different electrophiles was performed using Cluster 3.0 (de Hoon et al. , 
2004). The transcriptome datasets were derived either from previous publications or this study and included log2-fold expression changes 10 min after exposure of B. subtilis 
to the electrophilic compounds diamide (1mM) (Leichert et al. , 2003), MHQ (0.33 
mM) (Duy et al. , 2007), catechol (2.4 mM) 
(Tam et al. , 2006), FA (1 mM) and MG (2.8 
and 5.6 mM). The complete data set of all 
induced genes under these different conditions of electrophile treatment were listed and classified in to regulons in Tab. S6 
(
http://microbio1.biologie.uni-
greifswald.de/publications.html). After 
hierarchical clustering, the output was 
visualized using TreeView (Eisen  et al. , 
1998). For the clustering as shown in Fig. 5, 
we have used of 271 selected genes that are indicative for the thiol-specific stress 
response in B. subtilis  and regulated by CtsR, 
PerR, CymR, Spx, ArsR, CsoR, CzrA, YodB, 
YvaP (CatR). In addi tion, the MhqR regulon 
which responds specifically to quinones and the AdhR and HxlR regulons that are specifically activated by aldehydes are included in the clustering analysis.  
Northern blot experiment  
Northern blot analyses were performed as 
described (Wetzstein et al., 1992) using RNA 
isolated from B. subtilis  wild-type cells 
before (control) and 10 min after the treatment with 1 mM FA, 2.8 mM and 5.6 mM MG, respectivel y. Hybridizations 
specific for adhA, yraA, adhR, clpE, nfrA, 
cysK, katA, yqcK, hxlA, yrhE and yrhG were 
performed with the digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes synthesized in vitro  using T7 RNA 
polymerase from T7 promoter containing internal PCR products of the respective genes using the primer sets listed in Tab. S3.   
Western blot analysis  
Anti-FLAG polyclonal rabbit antiserums 
(SIGMA) were used at a dilution of 1:3000 to analyze the cytoplasmic protein amounts of FLAG-AdhR and FLAG-AdhRC52A proteins 
produced in the AdhR and AdhRC52A complemented adhR  mutant strains after 
induction with 2% Xylose. Fifty micrograms of each protein sample were loaded onto a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and the Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (Liebeke et al. , 2008). 
5’ RACE PCR  
The transcription start sites of adhR , yraC  and 
adhA  genes were mapped. Total RNA was 
prepared from B. subtilis CU1065 grown 
aerobically in LB medi um with and without 
the addition of 2 mM methylglyoxal. The cell 
cultures were grown to an OD
600 of 0.4 and 
split into two flasks with equal volume, 
methylglyoxal was added to one flask to a 
final concentration of 2 mM and cells were 
harvested 20 min after treatment. The RNeasy 
mini kit (Qiagen) was used as a method to extract total RNA from the cell lysates. The 
RNA concentration was quantified by 
NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Nanodrop 
Tech. Inc., Welmington, DE). The 2 μg of 
total RNA was used as a template for reverse 
transcription using Multiscribe
TM Reverse 
transcriptase (Taqman, Roche) and a gene-
specific primer (GSP1). The resulting cDNA 
was purified by gel extraction purification 
column (Qiagen) and added poly(dC) tail at their 3’-ends with te rminal deoxynucleotidyl 
transferase (New England Biolabs). The resulting cDNA was amplified by PCR using the poly-dG primer to anneal at the poly(dC) tail and a second ge ne-specific primer 
(GSP2), complementary to a region upstream of the GSP1 primer. PCR products were separated by gel electrophoresis and sequenced. AdhR (YraB)                                                   82                                                  Huyen et al., 2008b  
 Expression and purification of the AdhR 
protein 
AdhR protein was purified using PrepEaseTM 
His-Tagged High Yield purification Resin 
(USB). The adhR  gene was PCR amplified 
from B. subtilis  chromosomal DNA with 
oligonucleotides, designed to engineer an 
NdeI site upstream and a HindIII  site 
downstream of the adhR  gene. The PCR 
product was cloned into pET16b (Novagen) via the NdeI and HindI II sites. The sequence 
of adhR  in pET16 was verified by DNA 
sequencing. E. coli BL21/DE3 containing this 
plasmid was grown to mid-logarithmic phase 
at 37 °C in 1 liter of LB medium and 100 μg 
of ampicillin per ml. 
Isopropylthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to 1 mM and cells were harvested after further incubation for 2 h. After centrifugation, pellet was resuspended in 5 ml LEW (Lysis-Equilibration-Wash) buffer (50 mM NaH
2PO 4, 300 mM NaCl pH 8.0) and 
sonicated. After centr ifugation, supernatant 
was transferred to clean tube and then 
incubated for 15 min at room temperature 
with 1 g PrepEase Ni2+-IDA affinity resin 
(USB). The protein-bound resin was 
transferred to a column and washed 
extensively with LEW buffer. AdhR was 
eluted by adding 10 ml of 50 mM NaH 2PO 4, 
300 mM NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole pH 
8.0 to a column. Fractions of 1 ml were 
collected and tested for protein content using 
Protein Assay Dye (Bio-Rad) before pooling for subsequent purification. The protein was concentrated by Ammonium sulfate 
precipitation and further purified by 
chromatography on an FPLC Superdex-200 
column in 10 mM Tr is-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM 
NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.1  mM EDTA and 10% 
glycerol buffer followed by the dialysis into 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 , 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM 
DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA and 50% glycerol buffer and stored at -80°C. 
DNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays 
DNA fragments containing the promoter 
regions of adhR , yraC , adhA  and control yoeB  were generated by PCR. Approximately 
50 ng of purified PCR products were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New 
England Biolabs) and 50 μCi of [ γ-32P]-ATP. 
The labeled DNA probes were purified by gel 
extraction purification column (Qiagen) and 5000 cpm of each probe was incubated with different amount of purified AdhR protein for 5 min at room temperature in EMSA-binding buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM 
NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 μg ml
-1 Salmon sperm 
DNA and 50 μg ml-1 BSA). Add MG or FA 
into reactions (Final concentration of these 
compounds was 10 mM) and further incubate 
for 20 min. Samples were separated by 6% native polyacrylamide ge l electrophoresis in 
Tris-Borate buffer pH 8.0 on ice and constant voltage (100 V) for 2 h. Gels were dried and the radiolabeled bands were visualized using phosphoimaging.  
Determination of the cysteine content in the metabolome of B. subtilis  using GC/MS 
B. subtilis  cells were grown in Belitsky 
minimal medium to an OD
500 of 0.4 and 
treated with FA (0.5-1 mM) and MG (2.8 and 
5.5 mM) for 30 min. Cells were rapidly 
collected by the fast filtration method and 
intracellular metabolites were analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) as described previously (Liebeke et 
al., 2008).  
1H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)-
spectroscopy  
A solution of FA or MG was incubated with 
equimolar cysteine for 10 min at 25°C in a NMR tube (Norell ST-500). NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 600.27 MHz Avance-II spectrometer equipped with a BACS-60 sample changer and controlled with TOPSPIN 2.0 (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany). Bruker Icon  NMR software was 
used to automate the NMR data collection. 
1H-NMR spectra were measured with a 
standard Bruker pulse sequence (noesygppr), 
solvent presaturation,  a sweep width of 
12365 Hz, 64K data points at 298.5K. A total AdhR (YraB)                                                   83                                                  Huyen et al., 2008b  
 of 2 dummy scans and 256 scans were used to 
obtain the NMR spectra. All peak positions were measured relative to the TMSP (1mM 
sodium 3-trimethylsilyl-[2,2,3,3-D
4]-1-
propionic acid) reference peak set to 
δ = 0.0 ppm. AMIX® Bruker Biospin was 
used for compound identification by 
matching the obtained spectra with a 1H-
NMR spectra databank.

 GENERAL DISCUSSION 
1. The role of the MarR/DUF24 regul ators as sensors for electrophilic 
quinones and diamide in B. subtilis  
All living organisms express molecular systems that enable them to resist a variety of 
toxic substances and environmental stresses.  Exposure to ROS, which includes hydrogen 
peroxide, superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical and organic hydroperoxides (OHP), involves 
unique adaptive responses beyond those of general stress. ROS can damage proteins, DNA, 
lipids and membranes, which often lead to mu tations and cell death. Thus, ROS must be 
removed rapidly to avoid cellular damage [S torz and Imlay, 1999]. To overcome oxidative 
stress, cells activate the expression of detoxification and repair systems. The cellular response 
to oxidative stress in bacteria is largely regulated at the transcriptional level [Mongkolsuk and 
Helmann, 2002]. In several cases, the correspondi ng regulator also functions as a direct sensor 
of oxidative stress, an exam ple of the "one-component" regulatory strategy [Ulrich et al ., 
2005]. Regulatory proteins  that sense oxidative stress employ a variety of mechanisms 
ranging from the oxidation of metal centers, as in SoxR and PerR, to the oxidation of cysteine, 
as in OxyR and OhrR [Mongkolsuk and Helmann, 2002; Paget and Buttner, 2003]. Due to its 
nucleophilic character, r eactive cysteine residues in transcri ption factors can be oxidized by 
ROS leading to (i) disulfide bond formation or mixed disulf ides with LMW thiols (S-
thiolations) (ii) sulfenic, sulfinic or sulfoni c acid formation and (iii) cyclic sulfenamide 
covalent bonds ( Fig. 1.7) [Paget and Buttner, 2003; Ba rford, 2004]. In addition, cysteine 
residues can be also conjugated with ch emically-diverse electrophilic compounds via thiol-
(S)-alkylation [Giles et al ., 2003]. Depending on their chem istry, electrophilic compounds 
react with thiols by different mechanisms. Alkyl ating agents, such as IAA, aliphatic epoxides 
and alkyl halides display S N2 electrophilic chemistry. The reaction of quinones, 
hydroquinones and α,β-unsaturated carbonyls involves a 1,4-reductive nuc leophilic or 
Michael-type addition [Marnett et al ., 2003]. Of these modificat ions, disulfide bonds and 
sulfenic acids, but neither the hi gher oxidation states of cysteine  (sulfinic and sulfonic acid) 
nor covalent S-adducts with electrophiles, ca n be reversibly reduc ed by thiol-disulfide 
exchange reactions as catalyzed by the thiore doxin and glutaredoxin systems in bacteria 
[Holmgren et al., 2005]. General discussion 97 Thiol-specific stress response

Fig. 1.7. Chemical modifications to cysteine residues . (a) Sequential oxidation of cysteine by ROS gives rise 
to sulfenic acid (R-SOH), sulfinic  acid (R-SOOH)  and sulfonic acid (R-SO 3H) derivatives. Alternatively, 
oxidation by ROS may promote ( b) intramolecular cysteine disulfide bond formation within a protein, ( c) 
intermolecular cysteine disulfide bond formation between proteins, or ( d) a mixed disulfide between a cysteine-
containing protein and a LMW thiol such as GSH or mycothiol. ( e) Reduced cysteine residues can become 
oxidized to disulfides as a result of thiol-disulfide exch ange reactions with an oxidi zed protein (or an oxidized 
LMW thiol such as oxidized GSH; G-S-S-G). Cysteine residues can also be modified by RNS such as nitric 
oxide (NO) to yield an S-nitrosothiol (R-SNO; f), and by peroxynitrite (NO 3
) to an S-nitrothiol (R-SNO 2; g). 
This figure is adapted from Paget and Buttner (2003). 
E. coli OxyR is one of the first characterized  bacterial sensors of ROS. The OxyR 
regulon includes genes with protective and detoxification functions, such as katG  
(hydroperoxidase I), ahpCF  (alkyl hydroperoxide reductase) and dps (DNA-binding protein). 
The oxidized OxyR binds its targ et promoters as a tetramer ( Fig. 1.8) [Pomposiello and 
Demple, 2001]. In addition, OxyR activates transcription of genes that maintain intracellular 
thiols in their reduced states, including gorA  (glutathione reductase), grxA  (glutaredoxin) and 
trxA (thioredoxin 2) [Paget and Buttner, 2003]. OxyR can also be activated by other 
modifications of the active site thiol, including S- nitrosation, S-gl utathionylation, and sulfenic 
acid formation in vitro  [Kim et al ., 2002], although th e physiological relevance of these 
modifications remains controversial [Paget and Buttner, 2003].  General discussion 98 Thiol-specific stress response  
 
 
Fig. 1.8. The oxyR  regulon.  The OxyR protein is produced constitutively and is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide 
(H2O2). The oxidized form of OxyR binds to promoter regions of target genes and activates transcription by 
protein–protein contact with RNA polymerase. OxyR-activated genes have direct and indirect antioxidant 
functions. Each subunit of the OxyR tetramer contains tw o cysteine residues that form intramolecular disulfide 
bonds upon exposure to H 2O2. The disulfide bonds are re-reduced by GSH, which in turn is re-reduced by GSH 
reductase. The expression of the GSH reductase and glutaredoxin genes is under transcriptional control of OxyR, 
and thus the response is self-regulated. Abbreviation: GSH, glutathione. This figure is adapted from Pomposiello 
and Demple (2001).  
The exposure of B. subtilis  to ROS such as H 2O2 or organic hydroperoxides (OHPs) 
causes the induction of an oxidative st ress stimulon that is controlled by σB, PerR, Spx and 
OhrR [Fuangthong et al., 2001; Herbig and Helmann, 2001; Helmann et al., 2003; Nakano et 
al., 2003b]. The OHP resistance regulator OhrR controls the expression of the organic 
hydroperoxide resistance gene, ohrA , which encodes a thiol-dependent peroxidase 
(peroxiredoxin). Recent structural and biochemi cal studies on OhrA have shown that this 
enzyme contains alkyl hydroperoxide reductase  activity and detoxifies OHP by reducing these 
peroxides to alcohols [Lesniak et al., 2002; Cussiol et al., 2003]. OhrR nega tively regulates 
expression of ohrA  by binding to an inverted  repeat overlapping the ohrA  promoter region. In 
contrast, a second organic hydroperoxide resistance gene, ohrB , is induced by general stress 
conditions and starvation for glucose and phosphate which is under control of σB [Völker et 
al., 1998; Fuangthong et al., 2001]. OhrR is essential for th e response agains t lipophilic ROS 
by sensing the presence of OHPs [Sukchawalit et al ., 2001; Lesniak et al ., 2002]. OhrR 
homologs are present in both Gram-positive  and Gram-negative bacteria such as 
Xanthomonas campestris [Mongkolsuk et al ., 1998], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [Ochsner et General discussion 99 Thiol-specific stress response  
 al., 2001], Enterococcus faecalis [Rince et al., 2001], Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae [Shea 
and Mulks,  2002] and Staphylococcus aureus  [Chen et al., 2006].   
The B. subtilis  OhrR repressor senses OHPs with high sensitivity and high selectivity 
[Fuangthong  et al ., 2001; Lee et al., 2007]. Insights into the mechanism of peroxide sensing 
by OhrR have emerged from genetic and biochemical studies [Fuangthong and Helmann, 
2002]. OhrR is a homodimer of 147 amino aci d residues per subunit (MW~17 kDa) and 
belongs to the MarR family of transcription regulators [Fuangthong et al., 2001]. The fold of 
OhrR is similar to that of all other Ma rR family members and consists of six α helices and 
three β strands with topology: α1 (residues 14-36), α2 (residues 40-51), β1 (residues 54-57), 
α3 (residues 58-64), α4 (residues 68-81), β2 (residues 83-88), β3 (residues 95-101), α5 
(residues 102-122) and α6 (residues 130-143). Each subunit is divided into two functional 
domains: the dimerization domain, wh ich involves the N and C termin, α1, α2, α5, and α6; 
and the wHTH DNA binding domain, which consist of β1, α3, α4, β2, and β3. Helices α1 and 
α2 also form an interface between thes e well-defined functional domains [Hong et al., 2005]. 
Whereas most OhrR orthologs, like Xanthomonas campestris  OhrR, contain two or more Cys 
residues that may participate in their regulatory cycle [Panmanee  et al ., 2006], B. subtilis  
OhrR has only a single reactive Cys residue per monomer [Fuangthong and Helmann, 2002].  
Like other well-characterized peroxide sensors, OhrR is a peroxide-sensing regulator in that it 
relies on an active site cystei ne (C15) residue, which is cons erved amongst all described OhrR 
proteins [Fuangthong and Helmann, 2002; Kiley and Storz, 2004]. In addition, the structure of 
OhrR reveals that C15 is located at the N terminus of helix α1, suggesting that, besides its role 
in DNA binding, the helix-helix motif plays a key role on the peroxidation-mediated 
induction mechanism of OhrR ( Fig. 1.9a) [Hong et al., 2005]. Moreover, the high sensitivity 
of the active site cysteine (C15) to peroxi dation requires interactions with the opposed three 
tyrosine residues. This structure of OhrR reveals that the active site C15 residue is within 
hydrogen-binding distance of two ty rosine residues (Y29 and Y40) from the opposing subunit. 
Y19 is also critical for peroxide sensing ( Fig. 1.9b) [Soonsanga et al., 2007]. Recently it was 
shown that the 1-Cys B. subtilis  OhrR can be converted into  a 2-Cys OhrR by introducing 
another cysteine residue in eith er position 120 or 124 like the 2-Cys Xanthomonas campestris  
OhrR protein [Soonsanga et al. 2008b]. Finally, the recent analysis of OhrR inactivation by 
OHPs cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) and linoleic acid hydr operoxide (LHP) s uggests that this 
regulator may switch between reversible and i rreversible inactivation pathways depending on 
the nature of the oxidant ( Fig. 1.10) [Lee  et al ., 2007; Soonsanga et al., 2008a]. General discussion 100 Thiol-specific stress response  
  
Fig. 1.9. The crystal structure of OhrR.  (A) Cysteine residue (C15) of OhrR is critical for organic 
hydroperoxide sensing. Ribbon diagram of OhrR showing the two monomers (green and pink), with C15 
displayed as red van der Waals spheres. The DNA-binding helices are at the bottom. (B) The interaction of C15 
with the opposed tyrosine residues (Y19, Y29 and Y40) is also required. Close-up of the OhrR active site 
illustrates the close proximity of C15 to the Y29' and Y40' residues from the other subunit. Residues are 
represented by sticks, and carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms are gold, blue, red, and yellow, 
respectively. This figure is adapted from Soonsanga et al. (2007).

Fig. 1.10. Oxidation pathways for B. subtilis  OhrR . OhrR first is oxidized to the sulfenic acid form (k 1) which 
retains DNA binding activity [Lee et al., 2007]. The OhrR sulfenate is functionally inactivated by either S-
thiolation (k 2), protein sulfenamide formation (k 4), or overoxidation to the sulfinic and sulfonic acid derivatives 
(k6). The OhrR mixed disulphide can be rapidly re-activat ed by disulfide exchange in  the presence of reduced 
thiols such as DTT (k 3). The OhrR sulfenamide is slowly re-reduced by DTT (k 5) whereas the OhrR sulfinic and 
sulfonic acid derivatives are not. The figure is adapted from Soonsanga et al. (2008a). 
In its natural habitat, the Gram-positive soil-dwelling bacterium  B. subtilis  is exposed 
to a variety of toxic and antimicrobial ag ents that also include phenolic compounds. 
Catecholic or hydroquinone-like intermed iates are common in the metabolism of 
nitroaromatic compounds or organic insecticid es, and thus are often present in the soil 
[Vaillancourt et al., 2006]. Catechol and hydroquinone-lik e compounds can also cause toxic 
effects in microorganisms since these can be autooxidized to the corresponding ortho - and 
para -benzoquinones. Quinones can exert their t oxicity as oxidants and/or electrophiles 
General discussion 101 Thiol-specific stress response  
 [Monks et al., 1992]. As oxidants, quinones redox cycl e with their semiquinones producing 
ROS such as superoxide anion or hydrogen pero xide. As electrophiles, quinones can form S-
adducts with cellular thiols via the thiol-(S)-alkylation reaction that leads to aggregation of 
thiol-containing proteins in vivo  as irreversible thio l-modification [Liebeke et al., 2008].  
Recently, our previous proteomic and transcriptomic expression profiling of B. subtilis  
after exposure to catechol and MHQ has led to the identification of novel regulatory 
mechanisms that govern the thiol-specific st ress response, which are conserved among low 
GC Gram-positive bacteria [Tam et al., 2006b; Duy  et a l., 2007b]. A strong overlap in the 
response of B. subtilis  to catechol, MHQ and diamide was observed. Diamide is an 
electrophilic azo-compound that reacts with prot ein thiolates leading to the formation of 
disulphides or S-th iolated proteins ( Fig. 1.11) [Leichert et al., 2003; Hochgräfe et al., 2007; 
Leelakriangsak et al., 2008]. In contrast, electroph ilic quinones target cysteine via the thiol-
(S)-alkylation mechanisms resu lting in a direct depletion of  thiols. Thus, quinone compounds 
and diamide have the same mode of action but react via different thiol chemistries and lead to 
depletion of protein and non-protein LMW thiols . This leads to indu ction of the complex 
thiol-specific stress response to electrophilic compounds in B. subtilis , which is regulated by a 
complex network of thiol-stress sensing tr anscription factors Spx, CtsR, PerR, CymR 
[Leichert et al., 2003; Nakano et al., 2003b; 2005; Zuber, 2004; Leelakriangsak et al., 2007; 
Leelakriangsak and Zuber, 2007]. In addition, our  recent studies identified the novel MarR-
type repressors MhqR (YkvE), YodB and CatR (YvaP) that confer resistance to diamide and 
quinones via the control of specific de toxification pathways [Töwe et al ., 2007; 
Leelakriangsak et al., 2008; Antelmann et al., 2008; Huyen et al., 2008a].  
 
Fig. 1.11. Thiol-specific reactions of diamide in B. subtilis . Diamide is an electrophile azo-compound which 
reacts with protein thiolates and cau ses non-native disulfide bond formation. AzoR1 and AzoR2 confer also 
resistance to diamide and functions in detoxification of diamide via the reductive cleavage of the azo group, 
resulting in two molecules 1,1´-Dimethylurea.  This figure is adapted from Leelakriangsak et al., 2008. 
The MhqR (YkvE) regulon consists of mhqA , mhqED , mhqNOP  and azoR2 , which 
encode thiol-dependent dioxygena ses, oxidoreductases, a phos pholipase and an azoreductase, 
which function in reduction of quinones and diamide or in ring cleavage of quinone-S-
aggregates [Töwe et al ., 2007; Antelmann et al ., 2008]. Another thiol-stress-inducible General discussion 102 Thiol-specific stress response  
 repressor YodB controls Spx, the nitror eductases YodC and the AzoR2 paralogous 
azoreductase AzoR1 [Duy et al., 2007b; Leelakriangsak et al., 2007; 2008].  A further YodB-
paralogous thiol-stress sensing MarR-type regulato r, CatR (YvaP) regulat es the expression of 
the thiol-stress inducible yfiDE  (catDE ) operon, which encodes a DoxX-like oxidoreductase 
CatD and a catechol-2,3-dioxygenase (CatE) [Tam et al ., 2006b; Huyen et al ., 2008a]. 
Together, the MarR-type repre ssors MhqR, YodB and CatR c ontrol paralogous detoxification 
genes, including azoreductases, nitroreductase s, thiol-dependent dioxygenases and DoxX-like 
oxidoreductases that confer resistance to quinone com pounds and/or diamide in B. subtilis  
[Töwe et al., 2007; Leelakriangsak  et al. , 2008; Antelmann et al., 2008; Huyen et al., 2008a]. 
Thus, these novel MarR-type repr essors YodB, CatR and MhqR  constitute the novel quinone 
resistance network of B. subtilis  (Fig. 1.12).  
 
Fig. 1.12. Thiol-dependent detoxi fication of quinones (BQ). (1)  BQ is detoxified to hydroquinone in the two-
electron reduction by NAD(P)H-dependent quinone reductases (AzoR1, AzoR2, YodC and MhqN), which are 
controlled by YodB and MhqR. (2) The one-electron reduction of BQ generates semiquinone radical, which 
reduces molecular oxygen to superoxide anion. (3) Conversion of accumulated semiquinone radical to 
hydroquinone. (4) BQ reacts primarily electrophilic  with cellular protein thiols via the Michael addition 
chemistry (thiol-(S)-alkylation) leading to S-adduct formation. Since BQ has two reactive sites for the 
nucleophilic addition, it can cross-link different protein thiols in vivo . (5) The paralogous thiol-dependent 
dioxygenases (MhqA, MhqE, MhqO), which are regulated by MhqR might be involved in the dioxygenolytic 
cleavage of the thiol-(S)-adducts  that are probably exported via metal ion efflux systems. This figure is modified 
from Liebeke et al. (2008). 
Azoreductases are flavin-containing enzymes that have the unique ability to catalyze a 
wide range of biochemical reacti ons and have broad substrate sp ecificity [Fraaije and Mattevi, 
2000]. These enzymes catalyze the NADH-dependent two-electron re ductions of a wide range 
of substrates, including quinones, quinoneimines , azodyes and nitrogroups, to protect cells General discussion 103 Thiol-specific stress response  
 against the toxic effects of free radicals and RO S arising from one-electron reductions [Fraaije 
and Mattevi, 2000; Cavelier and Amzel, 2001]. The paralogous azoreductases, which are 
conserved among Gram-positive bacteria, are ma jor quinone resistance determinants and have 
common functions as quinone re ductases thus, preventing t oxic quinones from undergoing 
redox-cycling and causing depletio n of cellular thiols [Töwe et al., 2007; Antelmann et al., 
2008; Leelakriangsak et al., 2008]. Moreover, it has been demonstrated recently that AzoR2 
has NADH:DCIP oxidoreductase and azoreductase  activity [Nishiya and Yamamoto, 2007]. 
Therefore, both azoreductases, AzoR1 and Az oR2, could also be involved in the reductive 
cleavage of the elec trophile azo-compound diamide to 1,1´ -diamethylurea. In addition, 
another flavoenzyme, the nitroreductase MhqN  and a paralogous nitroreductase YodC also 
respond to thiol-specific stress [Töwe et al ., 2007; Leelakriangsak et al ., 2008]. Thus, 
paralogous nitroreductases are co-regulated with paralogous  azoreductases in response to 
thiol-reactive electrophiles. Nitr oreductases catalyze the two-el ectron reduction of nitrogroups 
in nitroaromatic compounds to nitroso, hydro xylamide intermediates and finally primary 
amines [Bryant and DeLuca, 1991]. Since quinone s represent substrates for nitroreductases 
[Nivinskas et al ., 2002], YodC and MhqN  could also function in  quinone reduction in B. 
subtilis  [Leelakriangsak et al ., 2008]. Interestingly, neither of these azo- or nitroreductases 
was induced by oxidative stress provoked by H 2O2 or the redox-cycling agent paraquat 
supporting that these enzymes ar e specifically involved in qui none and electrophile reduction 
and not in the oxidative stress response. As  ROS are produced upon auto-oxidation of MHQ 
and catechol, this could account for the induc tion of the PerR-contro lled oxidative stress 
response by electrophiles. 
The dioxygenases are also a majo r part of the thio l-specific stress response that confers 
resistance to quinone-like electrophiles. Whereas  azoreductases and ni troreductases function 
in the thiol-independ ent detoxification of electrophile s, dioxygenases could be involved 
mainly in detoxification of redox-stab le quinone-S-adducts [Leelakriangsak et al ., 2008; 
Antelmann et al., 2008]. Thus, we hypothesize that thes e dioxygenases are another class of 
thiol-dependent enzymes such as the thiol-de pendent peroxidase OhrA. The MhqR-regulated 
dioxygenases are conserved also among pathogenic Gram-positives including Bacillus 
anthracis , Listeria  or Staphylococcus . Dioxygenases belongs to th e vicinal oxygen chelate 
(VOC) superfamily that is structurally relate d proteins, which provide  a metal coordination 
environment with two or three open or readily accessible coordi nation sites to promote direct 
electrophilic participation of metal ion in catalysis [Armstrong, 2000]. The paralogous thiol-
dependent dioxygenases (MhqA, MhqE and MhqO) share similarity to the 
chlorohydroquinone/hydroqui none 1,2-dioxygenase of Sphingomonas paucimobilis  LinE 
[Endo et al., 2005]. As mentioned above, MhqA, MhqE and MhqO could be involved in the 
thiol-dependent ring-cleavage of quinone-S-add ucts, which are formed in the detoxification 
reaction of the LMW thiol buffer with quinones [Töwe et al., 2007]. This is supported by the 
finding that the fourth thiol stre ss-induced dioxygenase CatE wa s previously characterized as General discussion 104 Thiol-specific stress response  
 catechol-2,3-dioxygenase [Tam et al., 2006b]. Furthermore, another CatR-dependent enzyme 
CatD is similar to DoxX-like oxidoreductases. This enzyme is similar to the membrane-bound 
DoxX- and DoxD-subunit of  the thiosulfate:qui none oxidoreductase of Acidianus ambivalens  
involved in the early steps of sulfur oxidation [Müller et al., 2004]. CatD is paralogous to the 
MhqR-regulated DoxX-like oxi doreductase MhqP [Töwe et al., 2007; Huyen et al., 2008a]. 
Our proteome and transcriptome profiling also  revealed that more than 15 other NAD(P)H-
oxidoreductases respond to elect rophiles and might contribute to either the one- or two-
electron reduction of quinones in B. subtilis  [Duy et al ., 2007b]. These NAD(P)H-
oxidoreductases might be regulated  by other YodB paralogs of B. subtilis , as we have already 
shown for the NAD(P)H-flavin oxidoreductase YfkO  that is regulated by the transcriptional 
MarR/DUF24-type activator YybR [Antelmann et al., 2008; our unpublished data]. 
In summary, these conserved novel thiol-st ress-responsive mechanisms seem to have 
evolved to detoxify quinone-lik e electrophiles, which are naturally produced during electron 
transfer in the respiratory chain [Antelmann et al., 2008]. We have further proposed that DNA 
binding activity of the thiol-stress sensi ng YodB repressor could be inhibited via thiol-(S)-
alkylation at the conserved Cys6 residue in response to qui none-like electrophiles in vitro . 
This alkylation of regulatory thiols is an irreve rsible thiol-modification that cannot be reduced 
using the thiol-disulfide exchange reacti on as catalyzed by the thioredoxin-thioredoxin 
reductase system [Leelakriangsak  et al. , 2008]. In addition, we have shown that the conserved 
Cys6 residue of YodB was essential for re pression using site di rected mutagenesis  in vivo  and 
in vitro . Cys residues have been shown to be involv ed in the redox-contro l of other oxidative 
stress transcription factor s, such as OxyR, Hsp33 of E. coli  and OhrR of B. subtilis  
[Graumann et al., 2001; Hong et al., 2005; Nakano et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2007]. Thus, YodB 
was identified as a novel MarR/DUF24-family repressor, which senses thiol-reactive 
electrophiles via the conserved Cys6 residue. In additi on, mutational analyses also indicated 
that the Cys101 and Cys108 residu es of YodB may have role in  the repressor activity and 
response to quinones and diamide. This tr iple mutant, Cys6, 101, 108A shows reduced 
repression, but also lowe r responsiveness to inducers [Leelakriangsak  et al. , 2008]. 
Furthermore, using mass spectrometry, we uncov ered the formation of YodB-Cys-S-adducts 
upon treatment of the purified YodB repressor with MHQ and catechol in vitro  suggesting 
that DNA-binding activity of YodB could be regulated via thiol-(S)-alkylation in vitro . 
Cysteine residues are strong nucleophiles, which are shown to be conjugated with 
electrophilic compounds such as p-benzoquinone and hydroquinones to form thiol-S-adducts 
[Giles et al ., 2003; Dennehy et al ., 2006]. Thus, the derepressi on of YodB in response to 
quinones might be caused by quinone-S-adduction or even aggregation which remains to be 
shown in vivo  [Antelmann et al ., 2008]. Moreover, S-thiolati on has been shown as one 
regulatory mechanism for OhrR and OxyR [Kim et al ., 2002; Lee et al ., 2007]. This 
mechanism of S-thiolation is si milar to the S-glutathionylati on, which is thought to protect 
protein thiols against overoxidation to irreversible sulfonic acids [Lee et al., 2007; Hochgräfe General discussion 105 Thiol-specific stress response  
 et al ., 2007]. Thus, it could be also po ssible that YodB is regulated in vivo  in response to 
diamide via the formation of mixed disulfides c ontaining cysteine, Co ASH or other LMW 
thiols [Leelakriangsak et al ., 2008]. However, YodB is redox-controlled via intersubunit 
disulfide formation in response to diamide in vivo  [F. Schuster, Diploma thesis]. This 
regulation mechanism is similar to those of OhrR in Xanthomonas campestris , which also 
involves an intersubunit disulfid e bond between one N-terminal Cys22 of one subunit and one 
C-terminal Cys127 of th e other subunit [Panmanee et al ., 2006]. We currently defined the 
nature of the intermolecular disulfide bond, which is formed in the YodB dimer upon diamide 
stress using immunoprecipita tion and mass spectrometry.  
The MarR-type repressor MhqR also contai ns a cysteine residue  (Cys128), which is 
located in dimerization domain and accessible fo r thiol-modification according to published 
structures for B. subtilis  OhrR and E. coli  MarR [Alekshun et al., 2001; Hong et al., 2005]. In 
contrast to Cys6 in YodB or thologs, Cys128 of MhqR is not conserved among other Gram-
positive bacteria. In addition, in contrast to YodB and YvaP, DNA binding activity of MhqR 
was not directly inhibite d by quinones or diamide in vitro . Thus, the signal sensed by MhqR 
and the mechanisms, which lead to derepr ession of the MhqR regulon, are still unknown 
[Töwe et al., 2007; Antelmann et al., 2008]. 
YodB is highly conserved among low-GC  Gram-positive bacteria, and there are 
several YodB paralogs  in the genome of B. subtilis . In total,  B. subtilis  encodes eight 
MarR/DUF24-family regulators (YybR, YdeP, YkvN, YtcD, YdzF, HxlR , YodB and YvaP). 
The first identified MarR/DUF24-family regulator of B. subtilis  was HxlR, which is an 
activator of the hxlAB  operon that encodes the genes for the RuMP pathway [Yurimoto et al., 
2005]. The 3-hexulose-6-phosphate-sythase Hx lA and the 6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase 
HxlB are activated in response to FA stress and are involved in FA det oxification. In contrast 
to HxlR, which is activated after exposure of ce lls to FA stress, YodB and CatR (YvaP) act 
both as transcriptional re pressors [Leelakriangsak et al ., 2008; Huyen et al ., 2008a]. YodB 
paralogs have a conserved cyst eine residue in the N-terminal  part followed by a conserved 
proline residue. This N-terminal Cys residue  is also conserved among MarR/DUF24 family 
members in other Gram-positive ba cteria, and thus it is tempting to speculate that this Cys 
serves as conserved sensor for electrophile compounds.  
The thiol-stress sensing MarR/DUF24 repre ssor CatR (YvaP), wh ich regulates the 
yfiDE  (catDE ) operon in B. subtilis , is strongly related to YodB as judged by sequence 
similarity and function. Among the YodB-paralogs encoded in the B. subtilis  genome, CatR 
and YodB display most close sequence similar ities. Both YodB and Ca tR repressors also 
share the conserved N-terminal Cys6 and Cys7 residue, respectively that is essential for 
regulation and sensing of  electrophile compounds in vivo  and in vitro . In addition, our studies 
showed that the conserved basic amino acids K19, R20 are also essential for repression by General discussion 106 Thiol-specific stress response  
 CatR in vivo  [Huyen et al ., 2008a]. It was shown previously that neighboring basic amino 
acids facilitate the thiol-(S)-alkylation of the reactive thiolate anion [Dennehy et al., 2006]. In 
addition, all conserved basic ly sine and arginine residues lo cated in the HTH motif are 
essential for DNA binding of CatR as shown pr eviously also for the OhrR repressor [Hong et 
al., 2005]. Our results suggest that CatR is regulated via thiol-(S)-alkylation or aggregation at 
the conserved Cys7 by quinones [Leelakriangsak et al., 2008; Huyen et al., 2008a]. However, 
non-reducing SDS-PAGE analyses  showed intersubunit disulfid e bond formation for YvaP by 
diamide and quinones in vitro  [Huyen et al ., 2008a]. We are current ly raising antibodies 
against YvaP, which will be used to confirm if regulation of YvaP by diamide occurs via 
intersubunit disulfide formation in vivo .  
Together, our data reveal that B. subtilis  has evolved a sophisti cated network of three 
MarR-type repressors YkvE (MhqR), YodB and YvaP (Cat R) that control paralogous 
resistance determinants to thiol-specific qui none compounds. YodB and CatR control of 
quinone detoxification genes in cluding the azoreductase Az oR1 and the thiol-dependent 
dioxygenase CatE and the similar paralogous genes are controlled by MhqR. Thus, MhqR, 
YodB and CatR are novel determinants of this  complex network that senses and responds to 
thiol-reactive el ectrophiles in B. subtilis  [Töwe et al ., 2007; Leelakriangsak et al ., 2008; 
Huyen et al ., 2008a]. Detailed future work is nece ssary to elucidate the functions and 
regulation of all other uncharacterized MarR/ DUF24 family regulators and their regulons in 
the thiol-stress responsiv e regulatory network.  
2. The MG and FA stimulons of B. subtilis  
Quinones and α,β-unsaturated aldehydes are natu rally occurring electrophilic 
compounds, which target cysteine residues via the thiol-(S)-alkylat ion reaction.  Quinone 
compounds and α,β-unsaturated aldehydes di splay the same adduction chemistry, these react 
with cysteine thiols via the Michael addition mechanism. Like quinone compounds, α,β-
unsaturated aldehydes ar e highly toxic natural electrophiles, which are generated from 
oxidation of amino acids, lip ids and carbohydrates [Marnett et al., 2003; Farmer and Davoine, 
2007].  
MG is the most studied toxic natural α-oxoaldehyde, which is inevitably produced 
from triose-phosphate intermediates as by-pr oduct of phosphorylating glycolysis and also 
from amino acids and acetone [Ferguson et al., 1998; Booth et al., 2003; Kalapos, 2007]. MG 
reacts with nucleophilic centers of DNA, RNA and with the side  chains of the amino acids 
arginine, lysine and cysteine. The reaction of MG reacting with argini ne and lysine residues 
results in the formation of the widely studied advanced glycation endpro ducts (AGE), such as 
argpyrimidine or MG-cross-linked ly sine dimers (MOLD) [Bourajjaj et al., 2003]. The major 
protective mechanism against the deleterious effects of MG in E. coli  is the spontaneous General discussion 107 Thiol-specific stress response  
 reaction of MG with GSH to form hemith iolacetal, followed by isomerization to S-
lactoylglutathione and conversion to D-lact ate by the glyoxalase I and II enzymes ( Fig. 1.13a) 
[Ferguson et al., 1998; Booth et al., 2003].

Fig. 1.13. Thiol-dependent detoxification pathways for MG (A) and FA (B) in bacteria. (A) MG reacts 
spontaneously with GSH to form hemithiolacetal, follo wed by isomerization to S-lactoylglutathione by the 
glyoxalase I enzyme. S-lactoylglutathione is substrate fo r glyoxalase II enzyme, which is converted to D-lactate 
and free GSH. This scheme is adapted from Ferguson et al. (1998). (B) In prokaryotes and eukaryotes, FA is 
detoxified by GSH-dependent FA dehydrogenases (FDH) [Harms et al., 1996]. FA reacts spontaneously and 
reversible with GSH to S-hydroxymethylglutathi one. FDH-like enzymes such  as class III alcohol 
dehydrogenases catalyze the NAD-dependent oxidation of S-hydroxymethylglutathione into S-
formylglutathione. This GSH thiol ester is reversibly hydrolyzed by a S-formylglutathione hydrolase to GSH and 
formiate.  This scheme is adapted from Jensen et al. (1998).   
FA is another highly toxic carbonyl compound that is known to cause protein-protein 
and protein-DNA cross-links  in vivo  [Orlando et al ., 1997]. Like MG, FA also reacts as 
electrophile with the basic amino acid side chains  of arginine and lysine. Since FA is the key 
intermediate in the metabolism of C 1 compounds in methanotr ophic and methylotrophilc 
bacteria, it is ubiquitously dist ributed in the environment. T hus, prokaryotes and eukaryotes 
have evolved conserved detoxification pathwa ys for FA detoxification. These include GSH-
dependent FA dehydrogenases (FDH), which are ev olutionary conserved in all kingdoms of 
life [Harms et al ., 1996]. FDH-like enzymes catalyze th e NAD-dependent oxidation of S-
hydroxymethylglutathione, formed between GS H and FA, into S-formylglutathione ( Fig. 
1.13b). This GSH thiol ester is reversibly hydrolyzed by a S-fo rmylglutathione hydrolase to 
GSH and formiate [Jensen et al., 1998]. In addition, the RuMP pathway for FA fixation is 
involved in FA detoxification in many bact eria including also the non-methylotrophic B. 
subtilis [Yurimoto et al., 2005; Kato et al., 2006]. The 3-hexulose-6- phosphate synthase and 
6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase are key enzymes in  the RuMP pathway, which are encoded by 
the hxlAB  operon in B. subtilis . Interestingly, this hxlAB  operon is positively regulated by the General discussion 108 Thiol-specific stress response  
 MarR/DUF24 family protein HxlR which is cl ose related to the qui none-responsive YodB 
repressor [Yurimoto et al., 2005; Leelakriangsak et al., 2008].    
Since both MG and FA are toxi c electrophiles, eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells have 
evolved defense mechanisms to protect directly  by detoxification agains t electrophile toxicity 
and indirectly by the repair of the damages. In this main part of the thesis, we have applied 
genome wide transcriptome and proteome profili ng to study the mode of action of the toxic 
electrophilic compounds MG and FA in B. subtilis . The results showed that both compounds 
are strong thiol-reactive compounds and triggere d a similar cellular response as those of 
quinone-like electrophiles and diamide [Leichert et al., 2003; Tam et al., 2006b; Duy et al., 
2007b; Antelmann et al., 2008]. Both MG and FA induce the thiol stress-specific Spx, CtsR, 
CymR, YodB, PerR, ArsR, CzrA and CsoR regulons [Huyen et al., 2008b]. For example, the 
CtsR-regulated clpE gene was more than 100-fold upr egulated in the transcriptome 
experiments by FA. In addition, the microarray data also noted maximal derepression ratios 
for almost all CymR regulon genes by FA. The CymR-controlled ssu operon was very 
strongly elevated by FA stress, which encode s an uptake system for aliphatic sulfonate 
compounds and has been not detected as induced by other thio l-reactive compounds. 
Altogether, these results indicated an imbalan ced thiol-redox homeostasi s due to depletion of 
LMW buffer such as cysteine in response to both compounds which was verified also by the 
metabolomic approach [Huyen et al ., 2008b]. In addition, medium supplementation 
experiments  supported that cysteine protects cells ag ainst FA and MG toxicity as found in 
previous studies for electrophilic quinones [Liebeke et al., 2008]. 
The thiol-reactive nature of  FA and MG is further supported by the induction of the 
YodB regulon genes yodC , spx and azoR1 , which encode quinone resistance determinants. 
YodB was previously shown as  direct sensor for electroph iles, which is redox-regulated via 
thiol-(S)-alkylation by quinone compounds in vitro  [Leelakriangsak et al., 2008]. Thus, it was 
hypothesized that carbonyl compounds also targ et regulatory thiols of redox-sensing 
transcription factors.  In addition, the ykvN  and yybR  genes encoding two further 
MarR/DUF24-family regulators, respond to  MG, FA and quinone-compounds. Finally, the 
yfiDE (catDE ) operon was induced by carbonyls a nd quinones, which encodes a thiol-
dependent catechol-2,3-dioxygenase regulated by the MarR/DUF24 paralog CatR (YvaP) in 
B. subtilis  (see previous section of  the general discussion).   
Interestingly, the PerR regulon was induced  in response to MG and FA. The induction 
of the PerR-controlled oxi dative stress response in B. subtilis  under MG and FA stress 
conditions reflects the ROS producing and electrophilic mode of actions of MG and FA. The 
induction of the oxidative stress specific PerR  regulon genes by FA and MG could indicate 
that electrophilic carbonyl  and quinone compounds both ar e able to produce ROS 
[Mongkolsuk and Helmann, 2002]. Quinone com pounds can undergo redox-cycling reactions General discussion 109 Thiol-specific stress response  
 leading to the generation of semiquinone anions and ROS [O´Brien, 1991]. MG has been 
shown to provoke free radical generation invo lving ROS and RNS as well as organic MG 
radicals or cross-linked MG radi cals, which contribute also to MG toxicity mechanisms in 
eukaryotic cells [Kalapos, 2007]. Similarly, FA  causes cross-links between proteins and 
DNA, which results in the generation of secondar y electrophiles, which in turn could lead to 
ROS production [Orlando et al., 1997].  
Since FA and MG both also cause protei n-DNA cross-links, for example between the 
amino groups of lysine and cytosine [Orlando et al., 1997], the DNA damage responsive SOS 
regulon is induced under both carbonyl stress conditions. The induced genes of the SOS 
regulon include the DNA repair and recombination systems uvrB, uvrC and recA  and also a 
DNA alkylation repair enzyme, yhaZ . The induction of DNA damage-responsive regulons by 
FA has been shown also in ge nome-wide expression profiling in  Pseudomonas putida  [Roca 
et al., 2007].  
Furthermore, different cation efflux syst ems were strongly up-regulated by all 
electrophiles such as carbonyls, quinones and di amide. These include the ArsR-dependent 
arsR-yqcK-arsBC  operon required for resistance to As (III), Sb(III), Cd(II) and Ag(I) [Moore 
et al ., 2005]. Additionally, the CsoR-regulated copZA  operon which is activated by Cu(II) 
[Smaldone and Helmann, 2007] is induced by MG  and FA. The microarray and proteome 
results of FA and MG-treated ce lls indicate that metal ion e fflux systems also could function 
in protection against thiol-r eactive electrophiles by extrusi on of the toxic electrophiles 
[Antelmann et al ., 2008].  In addition, many genes of the σD regulon that are involved in 
motility, chemotaxis and cell wall turnover were up-regulated by aldehyde treatment as 
observed also in response to quinone compounds such as MHQ [Duy et al., 2007b].  
However, we noted also many differences in the induction prof iles by FA and MG 
compared to diamide and quinones, which mi ght be linked to specific detoxification 
pathways. For example, the microarray data i ndicate the specific induc tion of two operons by 
MG that could be involved in form ate detoxification. These included the yrhED  operon, 
which encodes the putative formate dehydrogenase YrhE and the yrhFG-yrzI  operon encoding 
the putative formate transporter Yr hG. The specific induction of both yrhED  and yrhFG-yrzI  
operons involved in formate detoxification by MG could be caused by contamination of 
commercially available MG with formate [Kalapos, 1999].  
Taken together, our global expression pr ofiling strongly implies that aldehydes 
represents a specific class of thiol-reactive electrophiles, which target cysteine thiols via the 
alkylation chemistry, thus depleting the pool of  the thiol redox buffer which was also shown 
using the metabolomic approach.  General discussion 110 Thiol-specific stress response  
 Finally, the most interesting results derived from the genome-wide study of B. subtilis  
to MG and FA was the induction of two speci fic regulons involved in  FA detoxification. 
These are the previously desc ribed HxlR regulon and the novel AdhR (YraB) regulon. HxlR 
is the FA-inducible MarR/DUF24-family repressor, which regulates the hxlA-hxlB  operon that 
encodes enzymes of the RuMP pathway for FA detoxification. 
Since FA is the key intermediate in the metabolism of C 1 compounds in 
methanotrophic and methylotrophilic bacter ia, it is produced th rough the degradation of 
compounds containing methyl or  methoxyl groups, e.g., lignin and pectin. Because FA is toxic 
to all organisms, FA detoxification pathways ar e found in a wide variet y of organisms. These 
include GSH-dependent FA dehydr ogenases (FDH), which are evol utionary conserved in all 
kingdoms of life [Harms et al ., 1996]. FDH-like enzymes catalyze the NAD-dependent 
oxidation of S-hydroxymethyl glutathione, formed between GSH and FA, into S-
formylglutathione. This GSH thiol ester is re versibly hydrolyzed by a S-formylglutathione 
hydrolase to GSH and formiate [Jensen et al., 1998]. In addition, the RuMP pathway for FA 
fixation is involved in FA detoxificati on in many bacteria including also the non-
methylotrophic B. subtilis [Yurimoto et al., 2005; Kato et al., 2006].  
The RuMP pathway, which was originally found in methylotrophic bacteria, are now 
found in a variety of microorganisms including bacteria and archaea for FA fixation and 
detoxification [ Mitsui et al., 2000; Vorholt et al., 2000; Yurimoto et al., 2002; Kato et al . 
2006 ]. In bacteria, the RuMP path way functions as a highly effi cient system for trapping free 
FA at relatively low concentration [Ferenci et al., 1974]. In the RuMP pathway, 3-hexulose-6-
phosphate synthase (HPS) and 6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase (P HI) are key enzymes. HPS 
catalyses the aldol condensation of FA with ribulose 5-phosphate. The subsequent product, D-
arabino -3-hexulose 6-phosphate, is isomerized by PHI to form fructose 6-phosphate [Arfman 
et al., 1990; Yurimoto et al., 2005; Kato et al., 2006]. The fructose 6-bisphosphate formed 
then converted to fructose 1,6.bisphosphate, whic h is subsequently metabolized into pyruvate 
via the glycolytic pathway (cleavage stage). Ribulose 5-phosphate, the acceptor of FA, is 
regenerated from fructose 6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate through a 
combination of transketolase, transaldolase,  and several reactions for pentose phosphate 
isomerization (regeneration stage) [Kato  et al ., 2006].  
Additionally, it was r ecently demonstrated that the Ru MP pathway is responsible for 
the detoxification of FA in non-methylotrophs  during growth on a FA-containing medium, 
e.g. in Bacillus subtilis  [Yasueda et al., 1999]. The HPS–PHI system is advantageous to other 
FA-eliminating reactions such as the GSH-dependent FA dehydrogenase system. The HPS–
PHI catalyzed reaction is an exergonic reacti on and does not require any cofactors like GSH 
and both the substrates and products of the HPS– PHI-catalyzed seque ntial reaction (e.g., General discussion 111 Thiol-specific stress response  
 ribulose 5-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate) are general metabolites that are essentially 
present in all organisms [Orita et al., 2007]. 
The genes encoding these two enzymes were first cloned from an obligate 
methylotroph, Methylomonas aminofaciens  77a [Yanase et al., 1996]. These genes have also 
been cloned from a facultative methylotroph, Mycobacterium gastri  MB19 [Mitsui et al ., 
2000] and a thermotolerant methylotroph, Bacillus brevis S1 [Yurimoto et al., 2002]. Genes 
homologous to HPS and PHI have been found in  a variety of non-meth ylotrophic organism, 
including bacteria and archaea. In the non-methylotroph,  B. subtilis , the hxlA (yckG ) and hxlB 
(yckF ) encode for HPS and PHI that ar e involved in FA detoxification [ Yasueda et al., 1999; 
Yurimoto  et al ., 2005]. This operon is regulated by the tr anscriptional activator HxlR (YckH) 
encoded by  hxlR (yckH ), which is oriented in th e opposite direction relative to hxlA and hxlB 
and is close related to the quinone-re sponsive YodB repressor [Yurimoto et al ., 2005; 
Leelakriangsak et al., 2008]. Disruption of either the hxlR gene or the hxlAB  operon results in 
increased sensitivity to FA, sugge sting that the RuMP pathway act s as a detoxification system 
for this compound [ Yasueda et al., 1999]. HxlR directly binds to specific DNA sequences 
within the intergenic region between the hxlAB  operon and the hxlR gene. Moreover, this 
HxlR binding site is necessary for FA-induced expression of the hxlAB  operon [ Yasueda 
et al., 1999; Yurimoto et al., 2005]. The HxlR protein belongs  to the MarR/DUF24 protein 
family of unknown function, which is widely di stributed in prokaryo tes. More than 270 
members of this protein family belong to the superfamily of winged helix DNA-binding 
proteins, which is made up of proteins with a helix-turn-helix motif [ Gajiwala and Burley, 
2000]. Thus, a DNA-binding protein HxlR, which is now designed as a transcriptional 
activator of the “helix-turn-he lix, HxlR type”, is necessary for FA-induced expression of 
hxlAB  operon . Furthermore, two 25 bp regions (BRH1 and BRH2) in the promoter region of 
the hxlAB  operon have been identified as the binding site for HxlR. However, the details as to 
how FA modulates hxlAB  expression are still unclear. Yurimoto et al. (2005) proposed two 
possibilities to explain this issue. One possi bility, which is similar to the SoxR-type 
transcriptional activation system in E. coli [Hidalgo and Demple, 1994; Hidalgo et al., 1998; 
Chander and Demple, 2004], is that a confor mational change in HxlR, induced by FA 
binding, may stimulate the recruitm ent of RNA polymerase to the hxlAB  transcription 
initiation site. Another possibility to expl ain FA- and HxlR-dependent induction of the hxlAB  
operon is that FA may bind to ot her factors, which in turn activate HxlR. It is tempting to 
speculate that also the conserved N-terminal Cys residue plays a role in regulation of the 
DNA binding activity of HxlR. Furthermore, we  observed the very high induction of this 
hxlAB  operon (20-140-fold) and the autoregulatory hxlR gene (3-10-fold) by either carbonyl 
compound, MG and FA. The global thiol-reactive m ode of action of FA further supports the 
control mechanism of MarR /DUF24-family regulators via the thiol-(S)-alkylation at the 
conserved regulatory Cys residue, wh ich is reflective for quinones and α, β-unsaturated 
carbonyls such as MG and FA.  General discussion 112 Thiol-specific stress response  
 The novel FA-inducible MerR/NmlR -type re gulator AdhR (YraB) regulates the adhA-
yraA  operon as thiol-dependent FA detoxification pathway  
Besides the hxlAB  operon, the microarray results identified also the conserved thiol-
dependent FA dehydrogenase-encoding adhA  gene, which is cotransc ribed with the cysteine 
protease of the DJ1/PfpI family encoded by yraA  and the yraC  gene, which encodes a γ-
carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase (CMD) as th e most strongly induced upon FA and MG 
treatment. These genes are regul ated by a MerR-type re gulator, YraB (AdhR ) that belongs to 
a sub-family of NmlR-like proteins, which all control adhA -like target genes. The 
characterization of AdhR as a novel aldehyde sensing regulator and the definition of the 
AdhR regulon was one further part of this thesis. 
Previous transcriptome analyses have revealed that yraA  is also most strongly induced 
in response to other thiol-specific stress c onditions, such as diamide, catechol and MHQ 
[Leichert et al ., 2003; Tam et al ., 2006b; Duy et al ., 2007b]. Expression of yraA  was also 
inducible by acid, ethanol and vancomycin, and yraA  mutant cells were sensitive to acid stress 
[Thackray and Moir, 2003; Jervis et al ., 2007]. In the case of other thiol-specific stress 
conditions or acid stress, induction of yraA  occurs in a Spx-dependent manner 
[Eiamphungporn and Helmann, 2008]. Recent studies  further showed that the previously 
suggested σM-dependent expression of yraA  is derived from the σM-dependent transcriptional 
activation of spx since yraA  belongs to those genes that ar e most strongly activated by Spx 
[Nakano et al ., 2003b; Eiamphungporn and Helmann, 2008]. Thus, expression of yraA  is 
activated either independently of S px by AdhR from a promoter upstream adhA  gene or Spx-
dependently from the yraA  specific promoter, whic h is located in the adhA-yraA  integenic 
region [Eiamphungporn and Helmann, 2008]. This double control of yraA  by AdhR and Spx 
was also shown in our Northern blot analysis. 
YraA is similar to the DJ-1/PfpI-family cystei ne proteinases that ar e also evolutionary 
conserved proteins and of t hus far unknown functions [Wei et al ., 2007]. This DJ-1/PfpI 
family includes human DJ-1, yeast Hsp31p, four E. coli  homologs YhbO, SCRP 27a, YajL 
and Hsp31, which all have been crystalli zed. Recently, Hsp31p has been shown to be 
involved in the protecti on against ROS [Skoneczna et al ., 2007]. The structures of these 
proteins are similar. They all possess a cons erved Cys residue in the nucleophile elbow motif. 
According to the DJ-1/PfpI-family homology, YraA could function in repair of thiol-
modifications in proteins caused by differe nt electrophiles and re lated toxic compounds. 
However, according to previo us studies, YraA ha d no detectable protease or chaperone 
activity [Thackray and Moir, 2003]. Phenotype anal yses showed that th e sensitivity of the 
∆yraA  mutant was similar to the wild type af ter exposure to FA (data not shown). Since yraA  
displayed sequence similarity to the σB-dependent yfkM  gene, we investigated the growth 
phenotype of the ∆yraA∆yfkM double mutant after exposure to FA stress. The ∆yraA∆yfkM  General discussion 113 Thiol-specific stress response  
 double mutant was more sensitive to FA than the wild type. Thus, both putative DJ-1/PfpI-
family cysteine proteinases can replace each ot her in FA-detoxification probably by repair of 
proteins with specific th iol-modifications [Huyen et al., 2008b]. 
The array data showed also the very high induction (10-40-fold) of the adhA  gene  after 
FA and MG treatment which encodes a NADH- dependent alcohol dehydrogenase. AdhA is 
similar to GSH-dependent FA dehydrogenases (FDH), which are evolutionary conserved 
among prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms [Harms et al ., 1996]. FDH, a ubiquitous 
cytosolic enzyme, belongs structurally to the family of alcohol dehydr ogenases and is actually 
homologous with the class I II alcohol dehydrogenases, the pyridine nucleotide-dependent 
enzymes, which catalyzes the tr ansformation of adducts of GSH such as 
hydroxymethylglutathione or S-nitros oglutathione (GSNO) [Koivusalo et al ., 1989; Kidd et 
al., 2007]. The true substrate for FDH is not free FA but the hemithioacetal formed 
nonenzymically from FA and GSH, namely S-hydroxymethylglutathione. FDH catalyzes the 
oxidation of S-hydroxymethylglutathi one into S-formylglutathione in the presence of NAD 
[Koivusalo et al., 1989]. Furthermore, this class of FDH-like enzymes has conserved GSNO 
reductase activity and functions in S-nitrosothiol homeostasis and protects against nitrosative 
stress in E. coli, Saccharomyces cerivisiae  and mouse macrophages [Liu et al ., 2001]. In 
contrast, our microarray data showed that this conserved FDH-like enzyme AdhA of B. 
subtilis  responds specifically to FA and MG but is  not induced under conditions of nitrosative 
stress [Moore et al., 2004]. Since our array data further revealed the induc tion of the thiol-
specific stress response, it was hypothesized that AdhA functi ons in the thiol-dependent 
detoxification of alde hydes. In addition to adhA , the microarray data showed high inductions 
of the yraB  and yraC  genes, which are encoded upstream of adhA  [Huyen et al., 2008b].  
The yraC  gene encodes an enzyme of 64 aa with similarity to γ-
carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase (CMD). CMDs  are formed by self-association of 
identical subunits [Parke, 1979]. These enzymes are involved in prot ocatechuate catabolism 
and in some bacteria a gene fusion event leads to expression of CMD with a hydrolase 
involved in the same pathway [Eulberg et al., 1998]. Recently, it was reported that an enzyme 
annotated as CMD in Methanosarcina acetivorans  had protein disulfide reductase activity, 
which depends on a CxxC motif [Lessner and Ferry, 2007]. However, this CxxC motif is not 
conserved in YraC. CMD-like domains are also  found in the alkylhydroperoxide reductase 
AhpD of mycobacteria [Bryk et al ., 2002]. It could be possibl e that YraC specifies a S-
formylthiol hydrolase activity genera ting formate and free thiol [Huyen et al., 2008b]. 
We identified the novel MerR/NmlR-type re gulator YraB (AdhR), which regulates 
itself and controls  positively the adhA-yraA  operon and yraC  in B. subtilis  in response to 
aldehyde compounds. The upstream sequences of adhA, yraC and adhR  contained typical 
MerR-like promoter sequences with a perf ect 7-4-7 inverted repeat (CTTAAAG-N4-General discussion 114 Thiol-specific stress response  
 CTTTAAG) between the -35 and -10 elements. In collaboration with the group of John 
Helmann (Ithaca), we have shown the specifi c binding activity of AdhR to its target 
promoters. The MerR family of transcription f actors is recognized as a diverse collection of 
regulators involved in a variety of stress responses, although most investigations of MerR-like 
regulators have been directed towards t hose, which respond to heavy metal ions [ Brown et al., 
2003]. For example, MerR family proteins incl ude regulators for metal ion resistance and 
efflux proteins such as ZntR and ZccR [ Brocklehurst et al., 1999; Kidd and Brown, 2003], 
CueR [ Stoyanov et al., 2001], CadR [ Lee et al., 2001] and PbrR [ Borremans et al., 2001]. An 
exception is SoxR, which contains a [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur cluster an d senses superoxide 
[Pomposiello and Demple, 2001]. Moreover, the AdhR-homologous MerR/NmlR-like 
regulator of Neisseria gonorrhoeae  NmlR was described as redox- controlled regulator, which 
positively controls itself and three other gene s encoding a GSNO reductase AdhC, a Cpx-type 
ATPase (CopA) and a thioredoxin reductase (T rxB).  These enzymes are involved in the 
response to thiol stress and are required for protection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae  against 
oxidants such as nitric oxide (NO) and OHPs [Kidd et al., 2005]. Such NmlR-like regulators 
form a distinct subfamily among the MerR family  and all regulate conserved the expression of 
adh-like genes ( Tab. 1.1) [Kidd et al., 2005; Stroeher et al., 2007]. Furthermore, these MerR-
type regulators have cons erved roles in protection against NO stress also in Haemophilus 
influenzae  and Pneumococcus  [Kidd et al., 2007; Stroeher et al., 2007].

Unlike other MerR-type regulators, NmlR  and AdhR lack the 4 conserved Cys 
residues present in metal-res ponsive MerR-type regulators ( Fig. 1.14). Instead, these NmlR 
homologues including AdhR all share the conserve d Cys52 residues that c ould play a role in 
redox-sensing of aldehydes. Interestingly, similar observations were made in previous studies 
for the FA-responsive transcriptio nal activator Hx lR [Yurimoto et al., 2005]. HxlR binds to 
its target operator sequences with similar a ffinities in the absence and presence of FA in vitro . 
HxlR shares similarity to the YodB represso r and five other MarR/DUF24-family members of 
B. subtilis . We have shown previously shown that Cys6 of YodB is the sensing cysteine General discussion 115 Thiol-specific stress response  
 residue that is alkylated  by quinone-like electrophiles in vitro  [Leelakriangsak et al., 2008]. 
This conserved Cys residue is also present in HxlR and all YraB-homologs among the 
MerR/NmlR-subfamily share a conserved Cys52 re sidue. Mutational analys es in collaboration 
with the group of John Helmann (Ithaca) showed that activation of adhA-yraA  transcription 
requires the conserved Cys52 of AdhR in vivo . We speculate that re dox regulation of AdhR 
involves thiol-(S)-alkylation of this Cys52 residue by aldehydes and that AdhA and YraA are 
specifically involved in reducti on of aldehydes and repair of alkylated thiol-containing 
proteins in B. subtilis . Furthermore, since aldehydes re act with thiols like quinones via the 
Michael addition chemistry, it is speculated that specific activation of HxlR and AdhR 
involves a S-hydroxymethyl-modifica tion at the conserved Cys residues. Thus, the next 
attempts are directed towards the identification of those thiol-modifications in vivo  in cellular 
proteins as well as in the al dehyde-specific regulator AdhR.

top of the panel while conserved cysteines related to NmlR are indicated by nC at the bottom of the panel. This

In summary, the global expression profile s upported that MG and FA act like diamide 
and quinones as another class of thiol-reactive compounds, which most probably target 
cysteine residues via the thiol-(S)-alkylation chemistry. Thus , cysteine is also one of the first 
barriers for aldehydes, which was strongly supported by protection experiments with 
extracellular cysteine. However, in contrast  to quinones and diamide, carbonyl electrophiles 
triggered a unique bacterial re sponse, which is governed by th e HxlR and AdhR regulons that 
control different detoxificati on pathways for aldehydes. The adhA-yraA  operon confers along 
with the hxlAB  operon resistance to FA indicating th at both systems are involved in FA 
detoxification, the HxlR-regulated RuMP path way and the AdhR-controlled thiol-dependent 
FA dehydrogenase pathway. Nguyen Thi Thu Huyen  116  Mn limitation

 SUMMARY 
The first part of this thesis was aime d to study the growth, morphology and gene 
expression profile of B. subtilis  in response to Mn2+ limitation. The morphology of B. subtilis  
changed from the normal rod form to longer filaments upon Mn2+ limitation in the presence of 
0.1 µM Mn2+. In addition, asymmetric cell division was observed under Mn2+ limitation 
conditions. The adaptation of B. subtilis  to Mn2+ limitation was studied in detail using 
transcriptome and proteo me analyses. Under Mn2+ limitation condition, both approaches 
revealed the upregulation of the MntR, Pe rR, CcpN, AhrC, PyrR, CymR, DegSU, SOS, 
Spo0A and ComK regulons. In addition, these an alyses showed also the downregulation of 
the Fur, CcpA, IolR, PhoPR, TnrA, CodY, PurR, σB, σM, σW, YvrGHb, YycFG, BceRS, σY, 
ResDE, Rok, AbrB, σH, Spo0A and σE regulons. The highest dere pression was observed for 
the PerR-regulated katA gene indicating an oxidative stress response of B. subtilis  under our 
conditions of Mn2+ limitation. The filamentation of Mn2+ limited B. subtilis  cells might 
indicate a blocked of cell division. This i nhibition of cell division might be caused by the 
observed downregulation of the σH dependent ftsZ and ftsA genes. Furthermore, Mn2+ 
limitation inhibited sporulation and induced competence development which was indicated by 
the downregulation of the σH, σE regulons and genes positively regulated by Spo0A, and the 
upregulation of ComK regulon and genes ne gatively regulated by Spo0A, respectively. Introduction  118  Mn limitation  
  
 INTRODUCTION 
Manganese (Mn) is the third most abundant transition metal in Earth’s crust [Frausto 
da Silva and Williams, 1991]. The name manganese  is appropriately derived from the Greek 
word mangania, which means magic. However, little was known about the cellular roles of 
this essential trace element [Jakubovics an d Jenkinson, 2001]. Mn2+ is required for the growth 
and survival of almost all living organisms. In plants, a Mn2+ containing cofactor is at the 
heart of the oxygen-evolving complex [Dismukes et al ., 2001] and in mammals, a Mn2+ 
dependent superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) help s to protect mitochondria from the byproducts 
of aerobic metabolism [Weisiger a nd Fridovich, 1973]. In bacteria, Mn2+ also performs these 
functions and it plays a significan t role in the virulence of several pathogens [Jakubovics and 
Jenkinson, 2001; Kehres and Maguire,  2003; Zaharik and Finlay, 2004]. Mn2+ participates in 
several vital metabolic processes. The list of enzymes that rely on Mn2+ for activity is 
numerous. Mn2+ serves as a cofactor for numerous  oxidoreductases, transferases and 
hydrolases [ Christianson, 1997; Yocum and Pecoraro, 1999; Crowley et al., 2000]. In 
addition, Mn2+ dependent enzymes are involved in n itrogen metabolism, hydrolysis of water 
in photosystem II and the modulation of some signal transduction pathways. Mn2+ also 
protects cells from oxidative stre ss, either as a cofactor for Mn2+ dependent catalase (MnCAT) 
and MnSOD or via its inherent ability to quench free radical-mediated reactions [ Coassin 
et al., 1992; Inaoka et al., 1999]. At next, current stud ies about the role of Mn2+ in the 
physiology of bacteria will be introduced.  
1. Manganese (Mn) transport  
Despite its contributions to cellular chemistry, Mn2+ becomes toxic at elevated 
concentrations [Que and Helmann, 2000; Guedon et al., 2003; Kehres and Maguire, 2003]. 
Thus, the health of the organism re quires both the ability to acquire Mn2+ from the 
environment and the capacity to  block uptake when cellular con centrations become excessive. 
Bacteria maintain Mn2+ homeostasis by tightly re gulated expression of Mn2+ transport systems 
[Jakubovics and Jenkinson, 2001]. 
The molecular mechanisms of Mn2+ uptake were unknown until Bartsevich and 
Pakrasi (1995) discovered the mntCAB  operon encoding an ATP-dependent transporter in 
Synechocystis  sp. PCC 6803, a cyanobacterium with a high Mn2+ requirement for 
photosynthesis. Then, ABC transporters for Mn2+ have been identified in Streptococcus 
pneumoniae , Streptococcus gordonii  and several other bacteria [ Dintilhac et al., 1997; 
Kolenbrander et al., 1998]. These transport systems are sufficiently structurally conserved 
within all the currently sequenced bacter ial genomes. At least, three types of Mn2+ import 
systems have been identified. The unusual transporter from Lactobacillus plantarum is a P-
type ATPase (MntA) with high specificity for Mn2+ [Hao et al. , 1999]. The other two types of Introduction  119  Mn limitation  
  
 Mn2+ uptake systems belong either to the natu ral resistance-associated macrophage protein 
(NRAMP) family or to the ATP- binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily.  
In Bacillus subtilis , Mn2+ is required as an enzyme cofactor and as a structural 
component of protein. The cell membrane prevents Mn2+ from passively entering the cytosol. 
This protective barrier must be passed to allow the cell to meet its Mn2+ requirements. Under 
Mn2+ limited condition, Mn2+ is internalized by an ac tive transport system ( Fig. 2.1). 
Conversely, when Mn2+ accumulates to excess, systems for Mn2+ sequestration or efflux are 
induced [Moore and Helmann, 2005]. As shown in Fig. 2.1, Mn2+ uptake is performed by both 
NRAMP (MntH) and ABC-transporter systems (MntABCD). MntH is a proton dependent 
Mn2+ importer. In contrast, Mn2+ uptake by the MntABCD system is likely to be driven by 
ATP hydrolysis [ Que and Helmann, 2000]. 
 
Fig. 2.1. Schematic diagram of known a nd putative metal homeostasis systems in B. subtilis . Metal ion 
uptake (left side, blue) and efflux systems (right side, gr een) are illustrated. For information on the regulators 
controlling the Mn2+, Fe2+ and Zn2+ transport systems, see section “Role of Mn in gene regulation”. This figure is 
adapted from Moore and Helmann (2005). 
2. Cellular functions of Mn 
Mn2+ metalloenzymes are involved in di verse functions within bacterial cells ( Tab. 
2.1) [Christianson, 1997; Yo cum and Pecoraro, 1999]. Mn2+ and other cations may be 
interchangeable in the metal-binding sites of many proteins. Most commonly, Mn2+ and Mg2+ 
are interchangeable because of the similarities between chelate structures of these ions. 
However, Mn2+ is essential for certain metabolic pathways. For example, oxygenic Introduction  120  Mn limitation  
  
 photosynthesis in cyanobacteria requires a tetra Mn2+ cluster present in the reaction centre 
complex of photosystem II [Yocum and Pecoraro, 1999]. A number of enzymes, such as 
adenylyl cyclase [Reddy et al., 2001], arginase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) 
[Christianson, 1997], polysaccharide polymerase [Cartee et al ., 2000] and protein kinase 
[Chaba et al ., 2002], specifically require Mn2+ for activity. The reduction of ribose to 
deoxyribose in nucleotide s is catalyzed by the Mn2+ dependent ribonucle otide reductase in 
Gram-positive bacteria [Willing et al., 1988]. Enzymes involved in sugar catabolism are Mn2+ 
dependent or have Mn2+ dependent isoforms [Dismukes, 1996], including L-fucose isomerase 
[Seemann and Schulz, 1997] and cellobi ose-6-phosphate hydrolase CelF of Escherichia coli  
[Thompson et al., 1999] and the D-glucosaminate dehydratase of Pseudomonas fluorescens  
[Iwamoto et al., 1995]. Furthermore, it appears that Mn2+ has an important role in bacterial 
signal transduction. The E. coli  proteins PrpA and PrpB belong to a family of Mn2+ containing 
serine/threonine protein phosphatases that are present widely in eukaryotes and modulate 
complex signaling pathways [Barford, 1996]. The biological importance of Mn2+ is not 
restricted to enzyme-mediated catalysis. For example, Mn2+ can detoxify a variety of reactive 
oxygen species (ROS). Add itionally, non-enzymic Mn2+ is crucial for the proper function of a 
variety of bacterial products, including secreted antibiotics [A rchibald, 1986], and contributes 
to the stabilization of bact erial cell walls [Doyle, 1989].

 2.1. Function of Mn in the oxidative stress response  
Oxidative stress can be defined as an ex cess of ROS that have strong oxidizing 
potential for cells [Fridovich, 1998]. ROS originate from partial reduction of molecular 
oxygen (O 2) to superoxide (O 2
), hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) and hydroxyl radical (OH·) 
[Storz and Imlay, 1999; Imlay, 2003]. The O 2
anion is known to attack enzymes with exposed 
[4Fe–4S] clusters which results in the release of Fe2+ and loss of enzyme activity [Gardner and 
Fridovich, 1991a; 1991b]. Furthermore, O 2
directly inhibits the s ynthesis of cysteine and 
aromatic amino acids [Imlay, 2006]. By spontaneous dismutation or in the course of its 
enzymic detoxification, O 2
 is rapidly converted to H 2O2. H2O2 is a weak oxidizing agent 
known to react with cysteinyl-thiols in proteins by formation of disulfide bonds or sulfonic 
acid derivatives [Imlay, 2003]. H 2O2 is able to generate carbonyl groups in lysine, arginine, 
threonine and proline residues and to oxidize methionine to meth ionine sulfoxides [Stadtman, 
1993]. Most significantly, H2O2 reacts with reduced Fe ions to form OH·, which in turn 
oxidizes most cellular compounds at diffu sion-limited rates [Henle and Linn, 1997].  
ROS are very reactive and can cause damage to macromolecular constituents such as 
DNA, RNA, proteins and lipids [Storz et al., 1990b]. Therefore, duri ng evolution, organisms 
either became restricted to niches free fr om oxygen (anaerobes) or  acquired protective 
mechanisms (aerobes). Most aerobic organisms respond to oxidative stress by the inducible 
synthesis of a variety of protective enzymes and proteins. Enzymes for protection against ROS 
include SOD, which catalyzes the dismutation of O 2
 to O 2 and H 2O2 [Fridovich,  1995], 
peroxidase and CAT, which prevent the intracellular accumulation of toxic H 2O2 [Hassan and 
Fridovich, 1978] and alkyl hydrope roxide reductase (Ahp) [Bsat et al., 1996]. Fe2+ is linked to 
oxidative damage, primarily thr ough the ability of Fe2+ to reduce H 2O2 [Touati, 2000]. One 
strategy for minimizing oxidative damage therefore involves limiting intracellular Fe2+ 
content. On  the other hand, bacteria growing in the absence of Fe2+ appear to have an absolute 
requirement for Mn2+ [Jakubovics and Jenkinson, 2001]. 
Bacteria have acquired elaborate defense mechanisms that co-ordinate Fe2+-sensing 
and Mn2+-sensing with oxidative stress responses [Bsat et al. , 1998; Storz and Imlay, 1999]. 
While Fe2+ is toxic and can promote OH· radical formation, Mn2+ containing compounds react 
with O 2
, H 2O2 and OH·, without generating deleterious free radical species [Cheton and 
Archibald, 1988]. Mn2+ is essential for the detoxification of ROS in most bacteria, principally 
activates the activity of MnSOD, MnP and MnCAT (see below). Interestingly, Lactobacillus 
plantarum  is essentially devoid of Fe2+ and heme but may accumulate a remarkably high (35 
mM) cytoplasmic concentration of Mn2+ [Archibald, 1986]. It is believed that much of this 
Mn2+ is “free” in a chemical sense and substitutes functionally for Fe2+ and heme in as yet 
chemically undefined ways. However, no new mechanistic studies on the chemistry of non-Introduction  122  Mn limitation  
  
 enzymatic free radical detoxification have been reported, while participation of Mn2+ in other 
free radical detoxifying processe s has received little atten tion [Kehres and Maguire, 2003].   
Manganese dependent superoxide dismutases (MnSODs)  
SODs are metalloenzymes that catalyze the disproportionation of O 2
 to O 2 and H 2O2. 
They are present in nearly all organisms from  bacteria to humans [McCord, 1976]. However, 
not all organisms contain the Mn2+ cofactor dismutase [Keele et al., 1970]. Other forms of 
SODs are known to contain Fe2+ [Yost and Fridovich, 1973], binuclear Cu2+/Zn2+ [Benov et 
al., 1995], or even Ni2+ [Youn et al ., 1996]. Resistance to the toxic effects of O 2
 more 
usually involves the concerted activities of two or more SOD. E. coli  possesses three SOD 
activities: periplasmic Cu/ZnSOD (SodC) and two cytosolic pr oteins, FeSOD (SodB) and 
MnSOD (SodA) [Fridovich, 1995]. Disruption of the sodA  and sodB  genes in E. coli  leads to 
enhanced sensitivity of cells to O 2
 and generates nutritional a uxotrophies resulting from 
inactivation of dihydroxy- acid dehydratase by O 2
 [Kuo et al. , 1987]. On the other hand, it 
appears that most streptococci and enterococci [Niven et al. , 1999]  and B. subtilis  [Inaoka et 
al., 1999] may produce only MnSOD. In B. subtilis , MnSOD encoded by sodA  was found to 
be associated with the abundant sp ore coat protein CotG [Henriques et al ., 1998].  This 
enzyme is predicted to protect cells fr om oxidative stress during growth and sporulation 
[Inaoka et al., 1998].   
Manganese dependent peroxidases and catalases (MnPs and MnCATs)  
Manganese dependent peroxidases (MnP s) couple the redox activity of H 2O2 to 
degradation of nutrien ts such as lignin via oxidation of a Mn2+ bound to a propionate side-
chain of the heme group. MnPs have thus far only been identified in lignolytic fungi, such as 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium [Gold et al., 2000].  
CATs are widely distributed enzymes that decompose H 2O2 to H 2O and O 2 as a 
detoxifying mechanism. Three phylogenetical ly distinct types of CATs have been described 
[Loewen et al., 2000]. The enzymes are defined as bifunctional and monofunctional CATs, 
depending on their abilities to function as peroxidases as well. The third group of CATs 
embraces the nonheme or pseudocatalases containing Mn2+, instead of Fe2+ heme, in the 
active site, and therefore is called MnCAT. In B. subtilis , one MnCAT, KatX catalase, was 
found. This enzyme is specifically produced in  the spores and may play a role in the 
protection of germinating spores against H 2O2 [Bagyan et al., 1998].  
2.2. Role of Mn during B. subtilis  sporulation and germination 
Early work in the 1950s demonstrated that Mn2+ is unique amongst the transition 
metals in promoting both endospore formation and spore germination in Bacillus . The Introduction  123  Mn limitation  
  
 requirement for Mn2+ is specific and can not be replaced by the addition of sodium (Na), 
potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), 
cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), stannum (Sn), cerium (Ce) or low concentration of 
iron (Fe) [Charney et al ., 1951]. Mn2+ appears to be important at several stages in the 
sporulation and germination ( Fig. 2.2). In the switch from symmetric to asymmetric cell 
division, Mn2+ is directly involved as a cofactor of the SpoI IE serine phosphatase [Schroeter et 
al., 1999]. This is a bifunctiona l protein that influences polar septum formation through 
interactions with FtsZ [King et al. , 1999] and that separately activates σF in the forespore by 
dephosphorylation of SpoIIAA [Kroos et al. , 1999]. It is possible that σF activation by SpoIIE 
may be regulated by Mn2+, since Mn2+ accumulates specifically within the developing 
forespore [Jakubovics and Jenkinson, 2001]. 
 
Fig. 2.2.  Roles of Mn2+ in the sporulation and germination . Mn2+ homeostasis is essential for efficient 
initiation of sporulation in the vegetative cell (1). The switch from medial to polar septum formation (2) is 
influenced by the Mn2+-requiring SpoIIE protein. Following septation, Mn2+ accumulates in the developing 
forespore. SpoIIE localizes to both pole s of the cell, but exclusively activates σF in the forespore. A drop in pH of 
around 1 unit accompanying forespore development (3) causes dissociation of Mn2+ from 3-phosphoglycerate 
mutase (3-PGM), inactivating the enzyme (3-PGM i) and leading to accumulation of the storage molecule 3-
phosphoglyceric acid (3-PGA) (4). Production of the inner (shaded) and outer (thick line) layers of the spore coat 
(5) requires MnSOD. Germination of the mature spore (6) involves a rapid increase in pH, leading to the 
activation of 3-PGM and the mobilization of 3-PGA reserves. Protease production at this stage is stimulated by 
Mn2+ and high levels of Mn2+ dependent pyrophosphatase (MnPPiase) are associated with an increase in 
metabolic activity. Chromosomal DNA is represented by wavy  lines. This figure is adapted from Jakubovics and 
Jenkinson (2001). 
Mn2+ also influences spore compos ition, structure and germination. B. subtilis  
endospores contain a storage re servoir of 3-PGA, which com poses 0.1 to 0.3 % of spore dry 
weight. It is converted to acetate after initia tion of spore germination [Paidhungat and Setlow, 
2002]. Accumulation of 3-PGA within the developing fore spore occurs following acidification 
of the forespore compartment with concomitant dissociation of the essential Mn2+ cofactor 
from 3-PGM ( Fig. 2.2). Upon initiation of spore germination, 3-PGM is rapidly reactivated 
following an increase in intracellular pH and 3-PGA degradation [Chander et al. , 1998]. When 
B. subtilis  is grown in a Mn2+ deficient medium, a large pool of 3-PGA accumulates in 
stationary phase cells and sporulation does not  take place [Oh and Freese, 1976]. Furthermore, Introduction  124  Mn limitation  
  
 during germination, Mn2+ is not only involved in the activation of 3-PGM but also the 
activation of proteases and inorga nic pyrophosphatase [Kuhn and Ward, 1998].  
2.3. Role of Mn in gene regulation 
B. subtilis  contains at least four distinct meta l ion dependent repre ssors. These are the 
Mn2+ dependent repressor (MntR, manganese tran sport regulator), cont rolling the regulon 
involved in Mn2+ uptake [Que and Helmann, 2000], and th ree Fur-like protei ns that control 
regulons involved in peroxide stress (Per R, peroxide stress response repressor), Fe2+ uptake 
(Fur, ferric uptake regulator) and Zn2+ transport (Zur, zinc uptake repressor) [ Chen et al., 
1995a; Bsat et al., 1998; Gaballa and Helmann, 1998]. A ll four proteins require a bound 
divalent metal ion in order to bind DNA: MntR responds to Mn2+ and Cd2+ [Que and 
Helmann, 2000; Kliegman et al., 2006], PerR responds to either Fe2+ or Mn2+, Fur responds to 
Fe2+ and Zur responds to Zn2+ [Herbig and Helmann, 2002]. 
2.3.1. MntR as regulator of Mn homeostasis 
Mn2+ is accumulated from the environment via a high-affinity tran sport system [Silver 
and Walderhaug, 1992]. Regulation of Mn2+ transport requires the activity of MntR in B. 
subtilis  [Herbig and Helmann, 2002]. MntR is responsible for Mn2+ homeostasis and is a 
distant homologue of the diphtheriae toxin repressor (DtxR) [Que and Helmann, 2000; 
Golynskiy et al ., 2006]. DtxR proteins ar e divalent metal ion de pendent transcriptional 
repressors [ Tao et al., 1992]. DtxR contains three domai ns: an amino-terminal DNA-binding 
domain, a central metal-binding domain (dimer ization domain) and a carboxyl-terminal SH3-
like domain [Herbig and Helmann, 2002; Golynskiy et al., 2005]. The SH3 domain in DtxR 
may regulate repressor activity [Wang et al., 1999] and contribute to additional metal binding 
[Pohl et al., 1998]. A comparison of MntR with the Dt xR family leads to three observations 
(Fig. 2.3): (a) the DNA-binding rec ognition helix is not highly conserved, suggesting that 
DNA recognition may vary between these famili es; (b) most ligands for metal binding are 
conserved, suggesting that the position of the metal binding sites is conserved (although not, 
apparently, the metal selectivity); and (c) th e third SH3-like domain is absent from MntR. 
Another significant difference is that the two metal ions in MntR form a bridged, dinuclear 
metal active site, which is distinct from th e two mononuclear sites found in DtxR [Pohl et al., 
1998; Kliegman et al., 2006]. In addition, DtxR is a Fe2+ responsive repressor [Boyd et al., 
1990], while MntR is responsive to Mn2+ and Cd2+, both in vivo  and in vitro  [Que and 
Helmann, 2000; Kliegman et al., 2006].  Introduction  125  Mn limitation  
  
 
 
Fig. 2.3. Ribbon representation of the crystal structures of ho lo MntR (left) and DtxR (right) . Proteins are 
colored to highlight domains and function: helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain (brown), dimerization domain 
(red), linking α-helix (green), additional dimerization α-helix (purple, MntR only), and SH3-like domain (gray, 
DtxR only). Mn2+ and Co2+ ions are shown as spheres in the binding sites of MntR and DtxR, respectively. This 
figure is adapted from Golynskiy et al. (2005). 
MntR is involved in Mn2+ homeostasis through regulation of two Mn2+ transporters, 
MntABCD and MntH [Que and Helmann, 2000]. When the Mn2+ requirements of the cell are 
sufficient, MntR binds Mn2+, resulting in DNA binding and repression of the mnt operons 
(Fig. 2.4). After drop of the Mn2+ levels below those required fo r sufficiency, the metal ions 
dissociate from MntR, and then MntR  is released from DNA resulting in mnt operon 
transcription [Golynskiy et al., 2006].

DNA-binding domains as red triangles . Dotted lines  are used to represent motions of MntR in solution. Spheres  
are represented as Mn2+ ions.  This figure is adapted from Golynskiy et al. (2007).   
2.3.2. Fur-like metalloregulators 
The Fur regulator has been best characterized from E. coli  (designated Fur EC). Fur EC is 
a metalloregulator that binds  to conserved operator se quences (Fur boxes) of Fe2+ uptake and 
siderophore producti on genes using Fe2+ as a co-repressor [Escolar et al ., 1999]. Fur EC has 
long been implicated as both a positive and ne gative regulator of gene expression [Lee and 
Helmann, 2007]. Fur EC is presumed to contain a regulatory site for sensing Fe2+. In addition, 
Fur EC contains a tightly bound structural Zn2+ ion that is required for proper protein folding 
[Althaus et al., 1999]. In vivo , Fur EC represses a large regulon of Fe2+ uptake functions when 
Fe2+ is present in excess [Braun, 1997]. Fur EC is also the prototype for a large family of Introduction  126  Mn limitation  
  
 regulators that sense Fe2+ (Fur), Zn2+ (Zur), Mn2+ (Mur) and peroxide stress (PerR) in E. coli  
[Hantke, 2001].  
In B. subtilis , the Fur-like metalloregulatory protei ns include several small, dimeric, 
DNA-binding proteins that respond to metal ions including Fur itself (Fe2+ sensor), Zur (Zn2+ 
sensor) and PerR (peroxide sensor) [Bsat et al., 1998; Gaballa and Helmann, 1998; Escolar 
et al., 1999; Lee and Helmann, 2007]. Like Fur EC, these three proteins are composed of two 
domains. The amino-terminal domain contains a helix-turn-helix motif with an unusual turn, 
and the carboxyl-terminal domain contains two metal-binding sites and is important for 
dimerization [Althaus et al., 1999]. Thus, the three Fur-like me talloregulatory proteins (Fur, 
Zur and PerR) are dimeric DNA-binding repressors, which contain two metal ions per 
monomer [ Herbig and Helmann, 2001; 2002]. One of the metal binding sites co-ordinates a 
Zn2+ ion that is generally assigned a structural role, whereas the second site bi nds a regulatory 
metal (Fe2+ for Fur, Zn2+ for Zur and either Fe 2+or Mn2+ for PerR) required for DNA binding.  
Fur functions primarily as a Fe2+ activated repressor of Fe2+ homeostasis controlling 
both the induction of Fe2+ uptake functions (under Fe2+ limitation), and the expression of Fe2+ 
storage proteins and Fe2+ utilizing enzymes (under Fe2+ sufficiency) [Baichoo  et al., 2002; 
Lee and Helmann, 2007]. Fur is part of the PerR regulon and not autoregulated [ Fuangthong 
et al., 2002]. Therefore, the fur gene is repressed only by Mn2+ [Chen et al., 1995a; Bsat et al., 
1996; 1998; Baichoo et al., 2002]. Fur represses at least twenty operons encoding about forty 
genes implicated in either  siderophore synthesis or Fe2+ uptake [Baichoo and Helmann, 2002; 
Baichoo et al ., 2002]. Fur also regulates positively an iron-sparing response in B. subtilis , 
which is mediated by a Fur-regulated small RNA (FsrA) and three small basic proteins that 
down-regulate expression of  Fe2+-containing proteins (succina te dehydrogenase or aconitase) 
under Fe2+ limiting conditions [Gaballa et al., 2008]. It is generall y accepted that Fur binds to 
Fe2+, and thereby, is activated to bind DNA, leading to the repression of Fe2+ uptake functions 
[Bsat and Helmann, 1999]. In addition, in vitro , numerous other divalent cations can also 
activate the Fur protein to bind DNA. Among these cations, Mn2+ is a functional co-repressor 
of the Fur protein [Herbig a nd Helmann, 2002]. Elevated Mn2+ levels appear to repress the 
Fur regulon in vivo  [Guedon et al., 2003]. However, the same authors proposed alternatively 
that elevated levels of Mn2+ perturb Fe2+ homeostasis by increasing availability of iron within 
the cell through displacing iron from a kinetically labile, loosely chelated pool. The nature and 
location of this pool are not clear. Simila rly, recent studies ha ve revealed that Synechocystis  
sp. PCC6803 accumulates large amounts of Mn2+ in a labile pool asso ciated with the outer 
membrane [ Keren et al., 2002].   
In B. subtilis , a Zn2+-sensing Fur paralog, Zur, represses the Zn2+ uptake system in 
response to Zn2+ sufficiency [Gaballa et al ., 2002; Moore and Helmann, 2005]. The Zn2+ 
uptake system consists of the Zn2+ uptake ABC transporters Yc dHI-YceA and a postulated Introduction  127  Mn limitation  
  
 low-affinity transport system YciABC [Gaballa et al., 2002; Gaballa and Helmann, 2002]. In 
addition, the P-type ATPase ZosA is also involved in Zn2+ uptake. However, the zosA  gene is 
not repressed by Zn2+ and is regulated by the peroxide-sensing repr essor PerR (see below) 
[Gaballa and Helmann, 2002]. On the other hand, Zur represses several genes not related to 
Zn2+ uptake but encoding homologues of ribosomal proteins ( rpmGC , yhzA  and ytiA) and 
finally a predicted Zn2+ binding membrane protein ZinT [Panina et al ., 2003]. In order to 
regulate Zn2+ uptake genes, Zur uses Zn2+ as a co-repressor. Zur may contain two Zn2+ sites-a 
structural site and a low affinity regulator y site [Baichoo and Helmann, 2002; Herbig and 
Helmann, 2002]. Both Zn2+ and Mn2+ can activate DNA binding in vitro [Gaballa and 
Helmann, 1998]. 
PerR is the major regulator of the peroxide stress response [Bsat et al ., 1998]. The 
PerR regulon includes a DNA-binding protein (MrgA) [Chen and Helmann, 1995], the major 
vegetative catalase (KatA) [Chen et al., 1995a], alkyl hydroperoxi dase (AhpCF) [Bsat et al., 
1996], enzymes of heme biosyn thesis (HemAXCDBL) [Chen et al., 1995a], a Zn2+ uptake P-
type ATPase (ZosA) [Gaballa and Helmann, 2002] and both the PerR and Fur 
metalloregulatory proteins [Fuangthong et al ., 2002]. Most PerR-re gulated genes are 
derepressed in cells treated with low level of H 2O2 or starved for either Fe2+ or Mn2+. The 
different genes of the PerR regulon have a divergent metalloregulation. Whereas PerR-
mediated repression of most target genes can be elicited by either Mn2+ or  Fe2+, repression of 
perR  and fur occurs selectively by Mn2+ [Fuangthong et al., 2002].  
In conclusion, Mn2+ affects three of four regulons , namely MntR, Zur, and PerR, 
directly by its ability to activat e DNA binding of their metalloreg ulatory proteins [Gaballa and 
Helmann, 1998; Que and Helmann, 2000; Herbig and Helmann, 2001; Kliegman et al., 2006]. 
The effect of Mn2+ on the Fur regulon is likely to be an indirect effect of Mn2+ via 
perturbation of Fe2+ homeostasis [Guedon et al ., 2003]. Furthermore, since MntR, Fur and 
PerR respond to an overlapping set of metal ions in vivo , these regulons are intimately 
interconnected ( Fig. 2.5). Introduction  128  Mn limitation  
  
 
 
Fig. 2.5.  Schematic diagram illustrating three int erconnected metalloregulatory circuits in B. subtilis . PerR 
is proposed to exist as an inactive, Zn2+ metalloprotein that can be activated for DNA-binding by either Fe2+ or 
Mn2+ to repress peroxide stress genes. The intracellular levels of Mn2+ and Fe2+ are regulated by the MntR [ Que 
and Helmann, 2000] and Fur [ Bsat et al., 1998; Bsat and Helmann, 1999] metalloregulatory proteins, 
respectively. This figure is adapted from Herbig and Helmann (2001). 
3. The aim of this part of the thesis 
The Mn2+ requirement of B. subtilis  for growth with glucose a nd for sporulation is well 
known and has been in the focus of research fo r a long time. Growth on glycolytic substrates 
depends on the availability of sufficient intracellular Mn2+ for proper functioning of 3-PGM. 
This enzyme needs 10 mM Mn2+ in vitro  to avoid inactivation [Watabe and Freese, 1979]. 
However, B. subtilis  requires Mn2+ also for non-glycolytic gr owth. Using fumarate or 
pyruvate as a substrate, Mohamed et al . (1998) demonstrated through in vivo  labeling with 
nucleic acid precursors a reversible impairment of DNA formation in the absence of Mn2+. 
Ribonucleotide reduction was also impaired under this condition. A peculiarity is that the 
Mn2+ depleted cultures finally reached roughly th e same turbidity after an initial lag. In 
summary, the effects of Mn2+ limitation in B. subtilis  recall phenomena of unbalanced growth 
previously reported for corynebact eria [Auling and Follmann, 1994].  
Although further evidence for a Mn2+ ribonucleotide reductase in B. subtilis  was 
obtained by Q-band EPR-spectroscopy [Mohamed et al .,1998], the factors contributing to 
unbalanced growth in this bacterium may be  more complex since many enzymes require Mn2+ 
for proper function [Archibald, 1986]. Using pr oteome and transcriptome analysis, genome-
wide expression profiling of B. subtilis  in response to Mn2+ limitation were one goal of this 
thesis. Understanding of  gene regulation of Mn2+ limited cultures was expected in addition to 
further insight into basic functions of Mn2+ homeostasis and the up-co ming protective role of 
Mn2+.Materials and Methods 129 Mn limitation  
  
 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
1. Bacterial strain and medium  
Bacterial strain used in this study is B. subtilis  168. The pyruvate minimal (PM) 
medium was used. The PM medium contains 10 g/l KH 2PO 4, 10 g/l K 2HPO 4 x 3H 2O, 2 g/l 
(NH 4)2SO 4, 0.5 g/l MgSO 4x7H 2O, 1 g/l KCl, 2 g/l sodium citrate x 2H 2O and 10 g/l sodium 
pyruvate. Before cultivation, 40 ml of a stock so lution of trace elements (500 mg/l EDTA, 200 
mg/l FeSO 4 x 7H 2O, 10 mg/l ZnSO 4 x 7H 2O, 30 mg H 3BO 3, 20 mg/l CoCl 2 x 6H 2O, 1 mg/l 
CuCl 2 x 2H 2O, 2 mg/l NiCl 2 x 6H 2O and 3 mg/l Na 2MoO 4 x 2H 2O), 9 ml of glutamate stock 
solution (0.5 M, pH 7) and 2 ml of  tryptoph an stock solution (0.039 M) were added per liter 
PM medium. Mn2+ stock solution (1 mM MnCl 2) was added into PM medium depended on 
the final desired concentration in each experiment.  
Only water purified by reversed osmosis (3 modules E-pure D4632240 VAC 
Barnstead, Dubuque, IA, USA) was used to  reduce the level of adventitious Mn2+ 
contamination. 
2. Growth conditions  
The effect of different Mn2+ concentrations on growth of B. subtilis  168 was studied in 
100 ml PM medium at 37oC, 120 rpm in 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks throughout using mid-log 
pre-cultures supplemen ted with 2 µM Mn2+. Cell growth was followed by measuring the 
optical density (OD) at 578 nm. 
The morphology of B. subtilis  168 under Mn2+ limitation (0.1 µM Mn2+) versus 
sufficiency (2 µM Mn2+) as a control was studied in 400 ml  modified PM medium in 2 liter 
Erlenmeyer flasks using mid- log inocula from PM medium  supplemented with 2 µM Mn2+ 
and incubating at 37oC, 120 rpm.  
For proteome studies by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel el ectrophoresis (2- D 
PAGE) analysis and transcriptome studies, B. subtilis  168 was incubated at 37oC and 180 rpm 
in 1 liter of PM medium supplem ented with 2 µM or 0.1 µM Mn2+  using 5 liter Erlenmeyer 
flasks. Mid-log pre-cultures supplemented with  2 µM served for inoculation. Cell samples 
were withdrawn as indicated in Fig. 2.6b. 
3. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)  
Cell samples from control and Mn2+ limited cultures were taken at different time points 
along the growth curve, harvested by membrane filtration. After fixation of samples with 2 % 
glutaraldehyde in 0.01 M dimethylamine buffer,  the samples were dehydrated by gradually 
increasing the ethanol concentration and by subsequent critical point drying (Balzers, Materials and Methods 130 Mn limitation  
  
 Wiesbaden, Germany). The fixed samples were sputter-coated with gold. Microphotographs 
were taken at 15 kV with a Zeiss DSM 940 sca nning electron microscope  (Zeiss, Oberkochen, 
Germany). 
4. 2-D PAGE  
Duplicates of 2-D PAGE experiments were  performed for each protein preparation 
from two independent cultivations under the control or Mn2+ limitation condition. 
4.1. Protein extraction 
Cells grown under the control and Mn2+ limitation, which were take n at different time 
points along the growth curve, were harves ted by centrifugation (8000 rpm, 10 min and 4oC) 
and washed twice with TE buffer (10 mM Tr is, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5). Cells were re-
suspended in TE buffer and disrupted by a twofol d passage through a Fren ch press (Minicell, 
Rochester, NY, USA) at 8000 psi and the cel l debris was removed by centrifugation (12000 
rpm, 10 min and 4oC). After having cleared the protein ex tract by an additional centrifugation 
(15000 rpm, 30 min and 4oC), the protein concentration of s upernatant was determined with a 
commercially available kit (RotiNanoquant) ac cording to Bradford [Bradford, 1976]. The 
protein solution could be stored at -20oC until further analysis.  
4.2. 2-D PAGE and quantita tive image analysis 
Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed w ith commercially available immobilized pH 
gradient (IPG) strips in the pH range 4-7 (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany). IPG strips 
were loaded with 200 µg of crude protein ex tract by rehydration for 24h, at room temperature 
in a solution containing 8 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 1 % v/v NP 40, 20 mM DTT and 0.5 % v/v 
Pharmalyte 3-10. The IEF was performed with  the Multiphor II unit (Amersham Pharmacia 
Biotech) employing the following voltage profile : linear increase from 0 to 500 V for 500 Vh, 
500 V for 2500 Vh, linear increase from 500V to 3500 V for 10000 Vh and final phase of 
35000 V for 35000 Vh. After consecutive equilibr ation of the IPG strips in solutions 
containing 0.35 % dithiothreitol (DTT) and then 4.5 % iodoacetamide (IAA), the separation in 
the second dimension was done in pol yacrylamide gels of 12.5 % acrylamide  on the 
Investigator 2-D electrophoresis system (Ge nomic Solutions, Chelmsford, MA, USA) with 
approximately 2 W per gel at 12oC. The resulting 2-D gels were  fixed with 40 % v/v ethanol 
and 10 % v/v acetic acid for 1-2 h and subseq uently stained with colloidal CBB [Neuhoff  et 
al., 1988]. The gels were scanned with a HP Scanjet Scanner.  
Quantitative image analysis was performe d with the Decodon Delta2D software 
(http://www.decodon.com), which is based on th e dual channel image analysis technique 
pioneered by Bernhardt et al . (1999). Using this software, the 2-D gel images from Mn2+ 
limitation experiments were aligne d to reference images (the control images) by using a warp Materials and Methods 131 Mn limitation  
  
 transformation according to the culture harves ting points. To avoid incomplete groups of 
matching spots, a fused 2-D gel wa s created for spot detection. Fo r preparing a fusion gel, all 
2-D gel images from control and Mn2+ limitation samples from each harvesting point were 
combined. Spot detection was pe rformed in the fusion gel contai ning all spots present in any 
gels of the control and the Mn2+ limitation samples from each harvesting point. The resulting 
spot shapes were reviewed and manually edited  in the fusion gel if necessary. The reviewed 
spot mask served as a spot detection consensus for all gel images of the control and Mn2+ 
limitation and was applied to the individual gels to guide the s pot detection and quantification. 
This enables spot quantification in all gels at  the same locations resu lting in 100 % matching 
and in a reliable analysis of complete expr ession profiles. Normalization was performed by 
calculating the quantity of each sing le spot in percentage related to the total spot quantity per 
gel. The values of pr otein abundance of the Mn2+ limitation sample were divided by the 
values of the protein abundance of the control sample for determination of protein induction 
or protein repression. Spots showing an induction of at le ast two-fold under Mn2+ limitation 
were designated as significantly induced protei ns. The identification of  the induced proteins 
was performed by comparing with the cytosolic protein map of B. subtilis  [Buttner et al ., 
2001; Eymann et al. , 2004] or via MALDI-TOF- MS according to Eymann et al. (2004).  
5. DNA microarray  
Cells grown under the control and Mn2+ limitation, which were take n at different time 
points along the growth curve, were harvested in  half of the sample volume ice killing buffer 
(20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl 2, 20 mM NaN 3) and then centrifuged for 3 min, 8000 
rpm and 4oC. The supernatants were discarded a nd the pellets were frozen in liquid N 2 and 
stored at -80oC until RNA preparation. The total RNA isolation was performed according to 
Eymann et al., 2002. The generation of fluorescence-la beled cDNA (Cy3-labled for control 
samples and Cy5-labled for Mn2+ limitation samples) and hybridization with B. subtilis 
whole-genome microarrays (Eurogentec) were performed according to Jürgen et al. (2005). 
The fluorescence intensity of two dyes were de tected by the ScanArray Express scanner 
(PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Scien ces, Rodgau-Jügesheim, Germany) using the 
ScanArray Express image analysis softwa re. The data analysis was performed via the 
GeneSpring software (Version 7.3 Agilent  Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). After 
background subtraction, signa l intensity was transformed by dependent LOWESS 
normalization according to the instruction of the manufacturer. The values of the Cy5-labeled 
samples (Mn2+ limitation) were divided by the normalized values of the Cy3-labeled samples 
(control) for determination of gene induction or  gene repression. Only genes, which were at 
least two-fold induced  (ratios above 2) or two-fold re pressed (ratios below 0.5) were 
considered as significantly induced or repressed under Mn2+ limitation, respectively. 
Duplicates of DNA microarray experiments we re performed for each RNA preparation from 
two independent cultivations in each condition. Results and discussion 132 Mn limitation  
  
 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
1. The impact of Mn  on growth behavior  
Firstly, the effect of diffe rence concentration of Mn2+ on B. subtilis  growth was 
examined. B. subtilis  was grown in PM medium supplemented with 0.05-5µM Mn2+. B. 
subtilis   grew well at 2, 2.5 and 5 µM Mn2+ and growth was limite d with 0.05 and 0.1 µM 
Mn2+ (Fig. 2.6a).

2. Morphological, proteomic and transcriptomic studies of B. subtilis  
in response to Mn limitation  
2.1. Morphology of B. subtilis  in response to Mn limitation 
As shown in Fig. 2.6a, the growth of B. subtilis  was limited with 0.1 µM Mn2+ which 
was chosen as Mn2+ limitation condition. In addition, 2 µM was chosen as condition that 
provides sufficiently Mn2+ supply as a control to Mn2+ limited condition. The experiment was 
designed as follows: B. subtilis  168 was grown with 2 µM Mn2+ medium and the exponential 
phase culture was transferred either to 2 µM Mn2+ or 0.1 µM Mn2+. Firstly, the change of cell 
morphology under Mn2+ limitation was observed by SEM ( Fig. 2.7). The resulting 
microphotographs showed that limitation of Mn2+ caused an alteratio n of cell morphology 
from the normal rod form of control cultures ( Fig. 2.7a, c, e)  to longer filaments ( Fig. 2.7b, d, 
f). Under Mn2+ limitation, cells with extreme length up to 15.3 µm (figure not shown) were 
observed. In addition, asymmetric  cell division was noticed in  the stationary phase under 
Mn2+ limitation ( Fig. 2.7f). On the basis of these data , two global experimental approaches 
(proteome and transcriptome analyses) were appl ied to reveal the changes of gene expression 
when B. subtilis  adapts  to Mn2+ limitation.  Results and discussion 133 Mn limitation

Cells with asymmetric division are indicated by red arrows.  Results and discussion 134 Mn limitation  
  
 2.2. Proteome and transcriptome analyses of B. subtilis  in response to Mn 
limitation 
Proteome and transcriptome analyses were performed using samples taken at different 
time points along the growth curve under control and Mn2+ limitation conditions (Fig. 2.6b). 
These analyses were performed two times for each  sample from two independent cultivations. 
Using 2-D PAGE analysis, twenty-five prot eins were signifi cantly induced under Mn2+ 
limitation ( Tab. 2.2). Six, fifteen and twenty proteins  were significantly induced after 5 h 
cultivation, 9 h cultivation and 12 h cu ltivation assigned to the exponential ( Fig. 2.8), 
transition ( Fig. 2.9) and stationary phase ( Fig. 2.10), respectively. In addition, under Mn2+ 
limitation,  51 and 181 genes were upregulated (T ab. 2.3) whereas 104 and 282 genes were 
downregulated (Tab. 2.4) in  the exponential and tran sition phase, respectively.  
Most importantly, the MntR, PerR a nd Zur regulons [Que and Helmann, 2000; Herbig 
and Helmann, 2002; Gaballa and He lmann, 2002] were induced by Mn2+ limitation. In B. 
subtilis , the mntH  and mntABCD  genes are regulated by MntR a nd involved in the pathways 
for Mn2+ uptake (Tab. 2.3). Th e transcriptome analysis revealed  that all five MntR regulated 
genes ( mntABCD and mntH , Mn2+ transport) belonging to two operons were induced by Mn2+ 
limitation. However, we noticed that induction of  the MntR regulon was onl y at the level of 2-
3 fold, which indicates that the medium and conditions used for Mn2+ limitation were not 
optimal in our experiments. Moreover, the tran scriptome results revealed a high expression 
level of  mntH  and lower induction of  mntABCD  under Mn2+ limitation  (Tab. 2.3). This is in 
agreement to data of Que and Helmann (2000) , which showed that MntH and MntABCD are 
high- and low-affinity systems for Mn2+ uptake. In addition, the transcriptome analysis also 
showed that mntH  was induced more in the exponential phase whereas the mntABCD  operon 
was slightly more induced during the transition phase. According to the report of Eisenstadt et 
al. (1973), Mn2+ uptake is activated during exponent ial growth phase, decreased upon 
stationary phase and increased again early during sporulation. Thus, MntH may be the 
predominant transport activity during growt h, while the ATP-dependent MntABCD system 
may play the major role in Mn2+ uptake during sporulation.  
In B. subtilis , Mn2+ is an effective co-repressor for the metalloregulatory proteins 
MntR and PerR [Que and Helmann, 2000; Herbig and Helmann, 2001; 2002]. Mn2+ mediates 
the regulation of PerR [ Herbig and Helmann, 2001; 2002] via binding to a regulatory site 
required for DNA binding. PerR is the major re gulator of the inducible peroxide stress 
response [Bsat et al., 1998]. The DNA microarray analysis reve aled that all genes of the PerR 
regulon [ Herbig and Helmann, 2002] were induced under Mn2+ limitation. Of thirteen PerR 
regulated genes ( ahpCF , fur, hemAXCDBL , katA, mrgA , perR  and zosA ), the highest induction 
was observed with the katA gene. Similarly, ahpCF  and mrgA  were strongly induced in the 
exponential and transition phase. These indicate th at cells mainly suffer from oxidative stress Results and discussion 135 Mn limitation  
  
 in our Mn2+ limitation experiments that confirms largely the proteome results in which the 
PerR-regulated proteins KatA, AhpC and AhpF  were strongly induced during all growth 
phases and the highest level of the inductio n was noticed for KatA. Furthermore, the 
induction of the regulatory gene fur (ferric uptake regulator) was higher during the 
exponential growth than in the transition phase. Three genes ( hemB , hemC , hemD ) involved 
in heme biosynthesis were induced in the expone ntial growth and all heme biosynthetic genes 
(hemLBDCXA ) were induced in the transition phase. The Zn2+ uptake gene zosA  (PerR 
regulon) was highly induced only in the exponen tial phase. These results are in accordance 
with reports by Herbig and Helmann (2001) and Guedon et al. (2003) that elevated levels of 
Mn2+ repressed the PerR regulon genes. Thus, Mn2+ mediates regulation of the PerR regulon 
as suggested by Herbig and Helmann (2001, 2002) and Fuangthong et al . (2002). The 
transcriptome analysis also s howed that the Fur regulon genes dhbACEBF , yclP, yclQ , ydbN , 
yfkM , ykuNOP , yuiI , and yxeB  [Baichoo et al ., 2002; Ollinger et al ., 2006] were 
downregulated in response to Mn2+ limitation. In contrast, the Fur regulon was also 
downregulated by elevated Mn2+ concentrations as published by Guedon et al. (2003). It was 
suggested that elevated Mn2+ displaces Fe2+ from cellular-binding site s and resulting rise in 
free Fe2+ levels leads to downregulat ion of the Fur regulon. Since fur is a member of the PerR 
regulon, the derepression of fur by Mn2+ limitation could result in the enhanced 
transcriptional repression of the Fur regulon in our studies.  
The induction of the Zur regulated Zn2+ transporter-encoding ycdH  gene by Mn2+ 
limitation was unexpected [Gaballa and Helmann, 1998]. This could indicate a role of YcdH  
for Mn2+ uptake. Interestingly, Bunai et al. (2004) speculated on a possible function of YcdH 
in uptake of Mn2+ in addition to Zn2+. Furthermore, Mn2+ limitation also induced the PerR 
regulon  member zosA  encoding a third Zn2+ uptake system. Thus, Mn2+ limitation has an 
impact on two Zn2+ transporters by different regulator y mechanisms. The high induction of 
zosA  in the exponential phase a nd the slight induction of ycdH  in the transition phase might 
suggest that ycdH  and zosA  genes function at diffe rent growth phases.  
Furthermore, the CcpN regulon [Servant et al., 2005], the AhrC regulon [Dennis et al., 
2002], the PyrR regulon [Switzer et al ., 1999], eight genes of CymR regulon [Even et al ., 
2006], three genes of the DegSU regulon [Mäder et al ., 2002] and six genes of the SOS 
regulon [Au et al., 2005] were induced under Mn2+ limitation. Three members of the CcpN 
regulon ( gapB , speD  and pckA ) and the AhrC regulated argCJBD-carAB-argF  operon were 
induced in both phases. Induction of the CcpN regulated gene gapB  were also observed 
throughout growth while that of the AhrC regulated gene  argD was observed only in the 
exponential phase on protein level. In addi tion, three members of the DegSU regulon ( licT, 
sacX  and sacY ) and the PyrR dependent pyr operon were induced only in the transition phase. 
The PyrR regulated protein PyrAA (carbam oyl-phosphate synthetase) was also induced 
during transition and stationary phases . Moreover, the CymR dependent gene ssuB  were Results and discussion 136 Mn limitation  
  
 induced only during the exponential growth, while ot her six genes ( cysC , cysH , sat, ylnD , 
ylnE and ylnF ) were induced in the transition phase and only the last one ( yhzA ) was induced 
in both phases. Two members of the CymR regu lon (Mtn and Sat) were induced during the 
transition and/or stationary phases. The microarr ay analysis further revealed the induction of 
six genes ( dinB , recA , tagC , yneA , yneB  and ynzC ) of the SOS regulon in the transition phase 
under Mn2+ limited conditions. The induction of recA  gene was also found during stationary 
phase on the protein level. In  this context, a report on a Mn2+ dependent ribonucleotide 
reductase in B. subtilis  [Mohamed et al ., 1998] is very important. Impairment of DNA 
precursor biosynthesis by Mn2+ limitation will inevitably cause phenomena of unbalanced 
growth, e.g., SOS response, inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell division [Elhariry et al ., 
2004]. 
Moreover, a subset of the ComK regulon [Berka et al., 2002; Ogura et al., 2002] and 
genes negatively regulated by Spo0A [Molle et al., 2003; Fujita et al., 2005] were upregulated 
whereas some genes regulated by σH and σE factors [Britton et al., 2002; Feucht et al., 2003; 
Steil et al., 2005] and genes positively regulated by Spo0A [Molle et al., 2003; Fujita et al., 
2005] were downregulated in the transition phase. Some genes ( comEB , nin and ssb) of the 
ComK regulon were also induced  on the protein level under Mn2+ limitation. These data 
support a clear indication of inhi bited sporulation and activated competence development in 
case less favorable for the sporulation, e.g. here, Mn2+ limitation. Furthermore, the ftsZ gene 
that plays a central role in bacterial cell division [ Harry, 2001] and ftsA gene that is crucial for 
septum formation [ Errington and Daniel, 2002] were do wnregulated on the mRNA level in 
the transition phase. The downr egulation of these genes  in combination with the induction of 
yneA  gene (SOS regulon), the downregul ation of genes belonged to the σM, σW, YycFG, 
YvrGHb and BceRS regulons [Cao et al., 2002; Mascher et al., 2003; Serizawa et al., 2005; 
Bisicchia et al ., 2007; Eiamphungporn and Helmann, 2008]  involved in cell wall stress 
response and the morphology observa tion (filamentous cell) under Mn2+ limitation suggests 
that the cell division is presumably blocked under Mn2+ limitation.  
Finally, many nitrogen metabolism gene s of the TnrA regulon [Yoshida et al., 2003] 
and about twenty σB dependent genes [Helmann et al., 2001; Petersohn et al., 2001; Price et 
al., 2001] were downregulated by  the transcriptome analysis  (Tab. 2.4). In 2003, Guedon and 
colleagues described that elevated Mn2+ activated the TnrA and σB regulons. They suggested 
that the TrnA regulator was controlled by Mn2+ dependent enzyme glutamine synthetase. 
Elevated Mn2+ reduced the sensitivity of  glutamine synthetase to feedback inhibitors, and it 
lead to the observed increase in  TnrA activity in th eir study. They also explained that the 
activation of the σB might result from the role of Mn2+ as a cofactor for regulatory protein 
phosphatases. Thus, our finding of the downregulation of TnrA and σB regulons under Mn2+ 
limitation adds the missing piece to TnrA and σB activation observed in the shift-up approach 
of Guedon et al. (2003). Results and discussion 137 Mn limitation
