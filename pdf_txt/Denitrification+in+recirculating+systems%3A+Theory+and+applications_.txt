 GENERAL INTRODUCTION  
Aquaculture production systems 
Aquaculture production systems can be cate gorized based on production intensity per 
water volume into four categories: ex tensive, semi-intensiv e, intensive and 
super-intensive (Lekang, 20 13; Bregnballe, 2015).  
Extensive production systems, for instance po nds, are characterized by low production 
per water volume. Produced fish are kept at  low densities and the human interference 
is limited to the maintenance of the aquatic habitat and the stocking of the fish. These 
production systems typically have low levels of technology. In a semi-intensive system 
the natural productivity of a pond is complemented by fertilization of the water and with supplementary natural or artificial feeds. Th is allows higher stocking densities and 
hence higher production per volume of water. The technological effort is higher compared to extensive systems. In intensive aquaculture farming, such as flow-through systems, the production per volume of water is  usually much higher compared to the 
latter production forms. To achieve this, complex management and high technological 
effort for water treatment are necessary. Inte nsive aquaculture involves the control of 
most environmental conditions, high stocki ng densities, and artificial feeding to 
increase the productivity and yields. In super-i ntensive systems the water remains in a 
closed circuit and is reused  after processing in water tr eatment units. These closed 
aquaculture recirculating systems (RAS) are isolated from the external environment 
and hence allow the full control of environm ental conditions under highest technological 
and financial effort. Due to the efficient recy cling of water highest production output per 
volume of water is achieved.  
Each aquaculture production type be ars advantages and disadvantages. 
Super-intensive systems usually have high costs, due to the investment and high 
energy requirement of the used technolo gy. In contrast extensive systems can be 
managed without any energy costs. Apart from  that, an extensively used pond will 
produce 0.2 kg fish per m², consuming 45 m³  of water per produced kg fish. Super-
intensive systems have a productivity in the rang e of 10 to 100 kg fish per m² and the 
water consumption is less than 1 m³ per kg fish production (Browdy et al., 2012; 
Bregnballe, 2015). Hence, sup er-intensive systems use th e available space and water 
resources much more efficient.  
   General Introduction  
_____________________________________________________________________

 A large number of microorganisms are capab le of denitrification, hence it is a 
ubiquitous process and occurs in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Denitrification is 
present in tropical and temperate soils, in  natural and intensively managed 
ecosystems, in marine and freshwater enviro nments, in wastewater treatment plants, 
manure stores, and aquifers (Skiba, 2008).  During denitrification, a net removal of 
nitrogen is realized since gaseous nitrogen compounds (N 2O and N 2) can leave the 
system and emit into the atmosphere. 
In intensive RAS denitrifying  processes do usually not take place, since the required 
environmental conditions are typically not present (anoxic conditions and a sufficiently 
available organic carbon source). RAS involv e high stocking densities and artificial 
feeding to increase productivity and yields of the system. This is only possible with full control of environmental conditions, ensuring high oxy gen saturation and low organic 
load in the water, both preventing denitrificat ion. As a result of inhibited denitrification 
and limited water replacement, nitrate accumulates in RAS. 
Influence of nitrate on fish 
Nitrate has been proven to have a negative im pact on health and growth of fish at 
species-specific concentratio ns (Scott and Crunkilton, 20 00; Shimura et al., 2004; 
McGurk et al., 2006; van Bussel et al., 2012; Schram et al., 20 14). Some of the 
negative effects describe d in these studies are meth emoglobinemia, endocrine 
disruption, and general hi stological damages. Also, ni trate causes damages in gills, 
intestinal ampulla, liver, and ki dney. Furthermore, nitrate impairs the feed conversion 
ratio, condition factor and the spleen-somatic index.  
In this thesis, pike perch ( Sander lucioperca ) and European sea bass ( Dicentrarchus 
labrax ) were used as model organisms. The influence of nitrate on pike perch, reared 
in RAS, was already investigated (Schram et al.,  2014). Until now, only little is known 
about the influence of nitrate on performa nce parameters and the health status of sea 
bass reared in RAS. Sea bass are usually fa rmed in seawater ponds, lagoons, and sea 
cages (Bagni, 2005). Nevertheless, sea bass is, next to turbot ( Psetta maxima ), one 
marine species which is intensively produced in RAS (Blancheton, 2000; 
Martins et al., 2010). It can be expect ed that the production of marine species in RAS 
will further increase, as already practiced for freshwater species, such as pike perch 
and salmonids. To meet appropriate water qualit y parameters in production cycles, it is 
necessary to estimate species specific requirements concerning the water quality.    General Introduction

 Within Chapter 1  of this thesis the influence of nitrate on performance parameters and 
health status of on-growing sea bass was cl arified. The results allow to estimate the 
effects of nitrate on sea bass production in RAS. 
Chapter 1  discusses following research questions: 
x Does nitrate have a significant impact on performance parameters of sea bass? 
x Does nitrate affect health status and mortality of sea bass? 
x What are threshold values for pr oduction of this species in RAS? 
x How sensitive are sea bass towards nitrate in  relation to literature data given for 
other species? 
Nitrate removal in RAS 
As nitrate is proven to have negative impa cts on fish and naturally occurring nitrate 
removal is usually not present in RAS, an ar tificial nitrate removal is crucial for fish 
production in closed RAS. Several  denitrification units were already introduced to RAS 
(van Rijn et al., 2006), bu t bear various challenges. Diff iculties arising in activated 
sludge systems are for instance sludge separ ation problems described by Tandoi et al. 
(2017). Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket Re actors can require a comparably long 
incubation phase for start-up  (Liu et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2003). Fixed/packed bed 
reactors tent to silt and need to be washed  every few days, resulting in additional work 
and in irregular denitrification rates (Sauthier et al., 1998). Fluidized bed biofilter must 
be operated permanently in a narrow water flow range in order to lift and maintain 
proper bed expansion, resulting in high en ergy costs for water pumping (Summerfelt, 
2006). Autotrophic sulphur reactors can decrease the pH and increase sulphate 
concentration in the rearing water (Oh et a l., 2001), both affecting fish health 
negatively. Furthermore, exis ting conventional heterotroph denitrification processes are 
often accompanied by challenges, such as the accurate dosage of a carbon source (e.g. methanol), mandatory for denitrification but potentially hazardous. 
The need of novel denitrification systems en suring safe, efficien t and easy to run 
denitrification processes at low maintenance costs  are stringently required to guarantee 
a trendsetting aquaculture produc tion form. One novel de nitrification system, the 
low-maintenance Self-cleaning Inherent gas Denitrification Reactor (SID-Reactor; 
Figure GI  - 2; patented by Müller-Belecke and S pranger, 2014) was introduced for the 
first time by Müller-Belecke et al. (2013).

 carbon source and a peristaltic dosage pump  constantly adding the carbon source to 
the influent water of the SID-Reactor. 
Promising first results of Müller-Belecke et al. (2013), working with the SID-Reactor in 
freshwater, revealed a high potential of an ea sy to use, safe and ef ficient denitrification 
system. Within the scope of this thesis the further technological enhancement of the SID-Reactor was striven for. Additionally , specifying the effects of basal operating 
settings of the SID-Reactor would clarify wh ether the SID-Reactor is a promising 
denitrification system for nitrate remo val also in marine RAS applications. In Chapter 2  
of this thesis the influence of specific operating settings of the SID-Reactor on water 
quality parameters and denitrification perf ormance were evaluated. During a long-term 
experimental trial the effects of varying hy draulic retention time, backflushing intervals, 
and carbon to nitrogen ratios were monitored in order to derive recommendations for a 
safe and efficient de nitrification process. 
Chapter 2  discusses following research questions: 
x Is the SID-Reactor a suitable denitrifi cation unit for nitrate removal in marine 
RAS? 
x How does the hydraulic retention ti me influence water quality and 
denitrification performance? 
x Do varying backflushing intervals,  preventing the SID-Reactor from 
clogging, also have a nega tive impact on water qu ality and denitrification 
performance? 
x What is an optimum carbon to nitrogen  ratio to achieve best denitrification 
performance? 
x Does an imprecise dosing of the carbon source (methanol) have an effect 
on water quality and denitrification?  
Chapter 3  of this thesis documents the possible replacement of methanol by 
biodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA ) plastics in the SID-Reactor used in 
freshwater RAS. The replacement of  methanol as a hazardous carbon source by a 
non-hazardous carbon source would increase safety  not only for fish but also for RAS 
staff. In contrast to conventional denitrifi cation systems the operating principle of the 
SID-Reactor is potentially not restricted to use either a liquid carbon source or a solid 
carbon source. The identification of basal oper ating settings and the use of a safe 
carbon source will reduce denitrificat ion related problems in RAS, enhance 
denitrification processes,  and will result in a safer and easier to control SID-Reactor.   General Introduction

quality?

carbon source?

 Abstract 
Coming along with the i ntensification of fish production in modern recirculating 
aquaculture systems (RAS) the water re-use in RAS is increasing. Accompanied by the water re-use, metabolic end products of fi sh and bacteria conti nuously accumulate in 
RAS process water. Nitrate, which is an end-product of biological nitrification processes, accumulates to high concentrations potentially influencing various physiological parameters of fish. The present study focusses on the effects of different nitrate concentrations on performance an d health status of on-growing European sea 
bass ( Dicentrarchus labrax ). On-growing sea bass were exposed to four different 
nitrate-N (NO
3--N) concentrations (control (C): 0 mg Lí; low nitrate-N (LN): 125 mg Lí; 
medium nitrate-N (MN): 250 mg Lí; high nitrate-N (HN): 500 mg Lí) in a triplicate 
experimental design in twelve small- scaled RAS for 10 weeks. The nitrate 
concentrations were adjusted with a sod ium nitrate and potassium chloride solution 
(Na+/ K+ weight-ratio of 1:27). Rising nitrate leve ls during the ex posure period, caused 
by the accumulation of metabolic nitrate, were avoided by batch water exchange twice 
a week. Final biomass, final individual weig ht, condition factor (CF), feed conversion 
ratio (FCR) and spleen-somatic index (SSI) w ere not significantly affected by nitrate 
exposure within the concentration range tested. Specific growth rate (SGR), and total 
mortalities did not signifi cantly differ between the trea tment groups either, although a 
trend towards decreasing SGR and increasing mortalities at high nitrate levels was 
obvious. This study revealed, that the hepa to-somatic index (HSI) and daily feed intake 
(DFI) were significantly nega tive correlated to with increasing nitrate levels. However, 
the sensitivity of on-growing sea bass towards nitrate toxicity seems to be low 
compared to other aquaculture fish species recently tested.

 1 Introduction 
Due to the rising demand for fish product s and concurrent stagnating fisheries 
production, new and independent production methods are necessary to meet the demand. The lack of space for expansion, th e limited fresh water availability and the 
tightened wastewater regulation s are considered as the main impediments for further 
expansion of conventional systems (Badiola et al., 2012; Dalsgaard et al., 2013). 
Hence, an intensified fish productio n in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) is of 
growing interest (Bregnballe, 2015; Dalsgaard et al., 2013). The technological progress 
of RAS can lead to a lower environmental impact due to the reduction of wastewater 
emissions (Deviller et al., 2004).  Simultaneously, an increasi ng number of new species 
is introduced to aquaculture (www.diversif yfish.eu; Robles and Mylonas, 2017; Tacken 
et al., 2015).  
European sea bass ( Dicentrarchus labrax ) and its general production as well as the 
improvement of husbandry conditi ons and intensification of producti on is in the focus of 
recent studies (Buscaino et al., 2010; Coni des and Glamuzina, 2006; Dülger et al., 
(UROGR÷DQHWDO  2004; Pichavant et al., 2001; Sa mmouth et al., 2009; Vectesi et 
al., 2012; Waller et al., 2015). Yet,  the successful production of new species in RAS 
depends on the identification of biologi cal requirements of the specific species of 
interest (Dalsgaard et al., 20 13). On the one hand, the isolation of RAS from the 
environment comprises many advantages li ke wide independence of location, 
improved hygiene management, good monitoring of most husbandry parameters and low water demand (Martins et al., 2010). On the other hand, the low water replacement 
rates may lead to the accumulation of m etabolic end products of fish and bacteria in 
the rearing water (Deviller et al., 2004; Schra m et al., 2014). Specifically, within the 
nitrification process, primarily ammonia-oxidizi ng bacteria (AOB) and nitrite-oxidizing 
bacteria (NOB) convert ammonia/ammonium (NH
3/NH 4+) to nitrite (NO 2í) and further to 
nitrate (NO 3í), which can accumulate and reach ha rmful concentrations (Hrubec et al., 
1996; Kincheloe et al., 1979; McGurk et al., 2006; Pierce et al., 1993; Scott and 
Crunkilton, 2000; Shimura et al., 2004, 2002; van Bussel et al., 2012; Westin, 1974).  
The not yet fully clarified pathways of nitr ate uptake by fish are discussed to be passive 
diffusion across the gills and/or the gastro inte stinal tract after ingestion of water (Bath 
and Eddy, 1980; Grosell and Jensen, 1999; Jensen , 1995; Learmont h and Carvalho, 
2015; Schram et al., 2012; Stor mer et al., 1996; van Bussel et al., 2012). However, the 
effects of nitrate are various and highly de pendent on biotic factors like fish species, life 
stage, or fish size. Also, abiotic factors such as the duration of exposure e.g. 
short-term (acute toxicity) or long-term exposure (chronic toxicity) are influential Chapter 1 
_____________________________________________________________________ 
 - 14 -   
 (McGurk et al., 2006; Scott and Crun kilton, 2000). Furthermore, cross-serial 
dependencies to other stressors (toxicants, water chemical parameters, initial health, etc.) can amplify negative effects (Wendelaar Bo nga, 1997). In general nitrate impacts 
a various number of physiological parameter s and impairs survival of various fish 
species (Kincheloe et al., 1979; McGurk et al., 20 06; Pierce et al., 1993; Scott and 
Crunkilton, 2000; Shimura et al., 2002; van B ussel et al., 2012; Westin, 1974). A widely 
described physiological effect is the m ethemoglobinemia, causing a reduced carrying 
capacity of oxygen by blood cells (Davidson et al., 2017; Learmonth and 
Carvalho, 2015; Pereira  et al., 2017; Wang and Chu, 2016; Wuertz et al., 2013). 
Methemoglobinemia is induced by endogenous conversion of nitrate to nitrite and the 
subsequent oxidation of haemoglobin to  methaemoglobin. Furthermore, previous 
studies associated endocrine disr uption in fish to nitrate ex posure (Freitag et al., 2015; 
Hamlin et al., 2008). Another negative effect of nitrate was reported by van Bussel et 
al. (2012), who observed a negative influence  of nitrate on feed conversion ratio (FCR), 
condition factor (CF) and the spleen-somatic index (SSI). Pereira et al. (2017) reported 
general histological damages caused by incre asing nitrate levels, while Shimura et al. 
(2004) specify nitrate related damages in gills, intestinal ampulla, liver, and kidney 
causing symptoms similar to  nutritional deficiency. 
Consequently, it is essential to evaluate  the influence of nitrate on health and 
production, and state nitrate threshold values fo r every species reared in RAS. Hence, 
European sea bass was used as one model organism for marine warm water species 
to evaluate related effects of four di fferent nitrate concentrations on production 
performance and health status. 
2 Material & methods 
2.1 Experimen tal animals 
Approximately 1700 European sea bass were obtained from neomar GmbH 
(Voelklingen, Germany) and kept as a fish stoc k in a large scaled RAS (40 m³) at the 
marine aquaculture facility (Gesellschaft für Marine Aquakultur Aquakultur (GMA) mbH, Büsum, Germany). For the expe rimental trials 408 sea bass (34 per RAS) with an initial 
body weight of approximately 108 g were ra ndomly distributed among twelve separate 
experimental RAS and adapted to the ex perimental condition s for ten days. The 
average initial biomass was 3.69 ± 0.02 kg per tank, resulting in a stocking density of 
13.17 ± 0.07 kg per m³. Fish that died during the adaptation phase were replaced. 
Individuals that died during  the experimental trial were replaced by fish with an equal Chapter 1

 weight to keep the nominal stocking density. The newly stocked fish were marked after 
sedation by clipping the gill cover. All marked fish were excluded from final individual-
based analysis (hepato-somatic index, spl een-somatic index, individual length, 
individual weight and condition factor) and the determination of the survival rate in 
order to guarantee that only fish exposed to the respective nitrate concentrations over the whole experimental trial were considere d for final analysis of the mentioned 
parameters. For group based parameters (specific growth rate, feed conversion ratio 
and daily feed intake) marked fish were included for calculations.

L hí from the protein skimmer and 400 L hí from the MBBR). 
 
2.2 Experimental RAS 
As shown in Figure 1 - 1  each RAS (320 L total volume) consisted of a rearing tank 
(280 L; 0.7 m² footprint, Kunststoff-S pranger GmbH, Plauen, Germany), a Hamburger 
mat particle filter (HMF), a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR, Kunststoff-Spranger 
GmbH, Plauen, Germany) and a protein sk immer (Model 1AH 1100, Erwin Sander, 
Uetze-Eltze, Germany). To tal flow rate was 500 L hí (400 L hí through the MBBR and 
100 L hí through the protein skimmer) and equal to an exchange rate of 1.8 times the 
tank volume per hour. The temperature was adjusted to 25°C by a 
temperature-controlled 500 W heater (Aqua Medic, Bissendorf, Germany). The pH was 
Chapter 1

 kept constant at 7.5 during the whole expe rimental period, by using sodium hydrogen 
carbonate powder (NaHCO 3). Technical oxygen was used to ensure oxygen 
saturations of >100%. The photoperiod was set to 14 hours light and 10 hours dark. 
Before the onset of the experiment, the RAS was filled with sand filtered, UV and ozone treated North Sea water (practical salinit y (S): 25 - 27). Two -thirds (210 L) of the 
system water were exchanged twice a week. Fish were fed a commercial feed (Aller Green, Emsland Aller Aq ua GmbH, Gloßen, Germany) until apparent satiation six 
days per week, three times a day. Uneaten pellets were re-collected from the system 
and counted for the de termination of daily feed intake. 
2.3 Installation of the nitrate  treatments and experimental 
conditions 
Based on the experimental de sign of van Bussel et al. (2 012) the experimental RAS 
were setup with nominal nitrate concentrations of 125 mg Lí1 NO 3í-N (low nitrate, LN), 
250 mg Lí1 NO 3í-N (medium nitrate, MN), 500 mg Lí1 NO 3í-N (high nitrate, HN), and a 
positive control grou p (control, C) with the lowest possible concentration, determined 
by the nitrate production in the system and the water replacement. The nitrate concentration between the three replicates of each treatment was statistically equal 
(p > 0.05), in contrast to the treatm ent groups, which were statistically different 
(p < 0.05), validating the ex perimental setup. After adjustin g the RAS to the respective 
nitrate concentration sea bass were dist ributed among the treatments. Each 
experimental group was kept in triplicates within the ten weeks trial. The nitrate concentrations were adjusted with a sodium nitrate (NaNO
3, Art.-Nr.8601.5, Roth 
GmbH+Co. KG, Karlsruhe, Germany) and po tassium chloride (KCl, Art.-Nr. 6781.3, 
Roth GmbH+Co. KG, Karlsruhe, Germany) so lution. The utilization of both salts 
provided a Na+/K+ weight-ratio of 1:27, which matches the concentration found in 
natural seawater and avoids imbalances of cellular homeostasis as recommended by 
van Bussel et al. (2012) and Romano and Zeng (2009, 2007).  To avoid rising nitrate 
levels during the experiment, 210 L water  per RAS were exchanged twice a week in 
batches, resulting in actual nitrate-N concentrations over th e experimental trial shown 
in Figure 1 - 2 . Prior to the water exchange, the prev ailing nitrate-N concentration was 
measured. Based on this value the required  amount of sodium nitrate and potassium 
chloride was added to the 210 L of exchang e water (sand filtered, UV treated and 
aerated North Sea water from a storage tank) to keep nominal nitrate concentrations. 
No sodium nitrate and potassi um chloride was added to the exchange water of the 
control treatment.  Chapter 1

Each treatment, control (C), low nitrate (LN), medium nitrate (MN) and high nitrate (HN) is 
arranged in triplicate design (I to III). 
 
Throughout the experimental period, all water quality pa rameters (except salinity and 
nitrate) shown in Table  1 - 2 were in a safe range for sea bass according to references 
given in Table 1 - 1 . Significant differences betwee n treatment groups (C, LN, MN, and 
HN) were observed for salinity, nitrite, nitrate, and pH (p < 0.05, Table 1 - 2 , indicated 
by small letters a, b, c, d). All other water quality parameters revealed no significant 
differences between treatment groups. 
Although salinity was slightly lower than the recommended minimum of 28, it can be 
stated that the prevailing values had no negative impact on the sea bass as a 
HXU\KDOLQHVSHFLHV$OJHUVHWDO(UROGR÷DQDQG.XPOX -HQVHQHWDO
1998; Marino et al., 1994). Si gnificant differences for salinity between the treatment 
groups correlated with nitrate concentrations. Nitrate concentrations were adjusted with a sodium nitrate solution, which in turn contributes  to salinity. Similar to salinity, nitrite 
also correlates positively with nitrate levels. The used measurement method of nitrite is 
based on the Griess reacti on (Griess, 1879) where the chemical reaction can be 
influenced at very high levels of nitrate to  slightly higher nitrite values. Nevertheless, 
referring to Blancheton (2000), nitrite valu es of all treatments were always below the 
harmful concentration of <2 mg L
í NO 2í-N and therefore, a negative impact on the sea 
bass can be excluded.  
Altogether, the prevalent water quality parameters listed in Table 1 - 2  (except NO 3í-N) 
can be excluded as factors negatively affec ting production and health performance of 
on-growing sea bass.

  2.4 Water quality analysis 
Physic-chemical parameters ( Table 1 - 2 ) were monitored regu larly during the 
experimental trial of ten weeks to ensure  optimum rearing conditions. Temperature, 
oxygen concentration and saturation (Handy Polaris, OxyGuard I nternational A/S, 
Farum, Denmark), and pH (multi 350iWTW, Weilheim, Germany) were measured daily. Practical salinity (S) (Refractometer HI 96 822, HANNA Instruments, Woonsocket, 
USA), total ammonia nitrog en (TAN) and nitrite (NO
2í-N) (MColortestTM, Merck KGaA, 
Darmstadt, Germany), as well as nitrate (NO 3--N) (cadmium red uction method 8171, 
DR 2800 photometer, Hach-Lange GmbH, B erlin, Germany) were measured twice per 
week. 
2.5 Growth and health parameters 
Prior and after the exposure  experiment, fish of each RAS were group weighed to 
determine initial and final biomass in each R AS. Furthermore, the individual weight and 
length of five randomly selected sea bass per RAS (in total 15 fish per treatment) was 
determined prior and after the experi ment. Subsequently, the sea bass were 
anesthetized, killed and dissected to measure liver and spleen weight. Additionally, 
total feed intake and daily mortaliti es were documented. From the collected data 
specific growth rate (SGR), feed conversion ratio (FCR), daily feed intake (DFI), 
condition factor (CF), hepato-somatic index (HSI) and spleen-somatic index (SSI) were 
determined according to formulas in Table 1 - 3 . 
2.6 Statistical analysis 
All statistical analyses were performe d using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 20 
(IBM Corporation, New York, USA). Data was tested for normal dist ribution based on 
graphical residual analysis and for homosce dasticity using the Levene-Test (p < 0.05). 
For normal distributed homoscedastic data (oxygen contend and saturation, 
temperature, pH, nitrate, practical salinity, individual weight, condition factor and 
spleen-somatic index), the ANOVA, based on  triplicates of the four treatments, was 
followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test (p < 0.05) in order to evaluate the differences between individual tr eatment groups (C, LN, MN, and HN).  
For non-normally distribute d heteroscedastic data (total ammoni a nitrogen, nitrite, initial 
biomass, final biomass, specific growth rate, fe ed conversion ratio, daily feed intake, 
hepato-somatic index and total mortality), Kruskal-Wallis-Test followed by 
Dunn-Bonferroni post-hoc test (p < 0.05) was performed in order to evaluate the 
differences between individual treatm ent groups (C, LN, MN, and HN).   Chapter 1

  The correlation of nitrate between health and performance parameters was tested by 
bivariate Spearman rank corre lation analysis (p < 0.05) 
3 Results and discussion 
Data for initial and final weight showed th at sea bass increased their average weight 
within the ten weeks trial by 30 - 40% to 169.7 g, 165.1 g, 165.8 g and 162.4 g for C, 
LN, MN, and HN, respectively. Consequently  the growth resulted in specific growth 
rates of 0.86 to 0.95% dí (Table 1 - 3 ). In general, fish showed no hampered growth 
performance within the trial compared to sea bass growth evaluated in other studies 
within a similar size  class. Lemarié and Toften (2002), and Sammouth et al. (2009) 
reported SGRs of 0.71 to 0.81% dí for on- growing sea bass (100 - 150 g). Also, the 
DFI of 1.42 to 1.58% dí and FCR of approximately 1.66 g gí for C, LN, MN, and HN, 
were in an appropriate range for on-growi ng sea bass (Picha vant et al., 2001; 
Sammouth et al., 2009).  
At the end of the ten weeks trial, comp arison of production and health parameters 
between treatment groups (C, LN, MN, and HN) revealed no  significant differences for 
all parameters listed in Table 1 - 3  except for HSI (p < 0. 05). Additionally, HSI 
UV í S 0 Q  DQG '), UV í p=0.037, n=12) significantly 
decreased with increasing nitrate levels acco rding to the rank correlation analysis 
(Figure 1 - 3 ). For pikeperch and African catfish  nitrate-mediated reduction of feed 
intake and growth was documented by Schra m et al. (2012, 2014), stating that 
especially reduced feed intake is a strong and sensitive indicator for deleterious nitrate 
levels. Hence, nitrate is most likely the re ason for the reduced DFI observed in the 
present study. Adams et al. (1992) reported  a relationship between unspecified toxicant 
exposure and physiological effects in redbreast sunfish ( Lepomis auritus ). In that study 
elevated levels of detoxification enzymes were associated with low lipid levels, histopathological damage, and reduced growth. It is obvious that first signs of 
intoxication on histo-pathol ogical changes occurred, whil e liver functions include 
detoxification and energy consuming protein sy nthesis (e.g. detoxification enzymes). In 
the presented study, reduced HSI could be  the first indicator for nitrate related 
intoxication of sea bass. The intoxication leads to increased energy consuming 
detoxification causing reduced lipid levels an d consequently results in lower HSI values 
(Adams et al., 1992). It can  be assumed that an intoxi cation leads to more intense 
effects on the health and the growth perf ormance at longer exposure time. Pereira et 
al. (2017) documented general and histological damages of juvenile zebrafish 
(Danio rerio ) with increasing nitrate levels.

  Within the study histopathological changes were observed for gills (oedema, 
hyperaemia, haemorrhages, and hyperplasia and necrosis of epithelial cells), skin 
(epidermis desquamation and de rmis desquamation), kidney  (vacuolar degeneration of 
epithelial cells of renal tubules, hy peraemia, haemorrhage, and others), liver 
(hepatocyte vacuolization, hypertrophy and ne crosis, and depletion of lipid reserves), 
and intestine (goblet cells hyperplasia in  the anterior intesti ne, vacuolization and 
hypertrophy of the enterocytes of the poster ior intestine, and others). Coincident, toxic 
effects of nitrate in Medaka fish ( Oryzias latipes ) were observed in the gills, the 
intestinal ampulla, the liver, and the kidney (Shimura et al., 2004 ). Especially the 
chronic nitrate exposure can impair hepati c function and consequently lead to 
symptoms similar to those of nutritional defici ency (Shimura et al., 20 04). Results of the 
present work match these statements since th e significant negati ve correlated HSI and 
DFI (p < 0.05, Figure 1 - 3 ) towards higher nitrate levels can lead to reduced growth 
and production performance, even  though not statistically significant in this study. The 
statistical analyses of variances for SGR and t otal mortalities reveal ed no significant 
differences (p > 0.05), possibly caused by hi gh standard deviatio n. Nevertheless, the 
UDQNFRUUHODWLRQDQDO\VLVUHYHDOHGWKDW6*5YDOXHVUV í S 0.119, n=12) tended 
to show a significant negati ve correlation and mortalities (rs=0.521, p=0.083, n=12) 
tended to show a significan t positive correlation with higher nitrate levels ( Figure 1 - 3 ). 
Van Bussel et al. (2012) reported a negati vely linear correlated effect of nitrate on 
SGR, final weight, final length, and biomass  yield starting at concentrations of 
125 mg Lí NO 3í-N for juvenile turbot ( Psetta maxima ) exposed to nitrate 
concentrations equal to the nitrate concentration used in the presented study. 
Additionally van Bussel et al. (2012) revealed, that mortal ity, FCR, CF, and SSI were 
significantly higher in MN and HN compared to C and LN groups. Comparing results of 
the present study to results of van Bussel et al. (2012) it can be suggested that on-
growing sea bass are more tolerant to elevated nitrate levels compared to juvenile turbot. Similar, Schram et al. (2014) observed no effects of nitrate on physiology and 
growth of juvenile pikeperch at nitrate-N levels as high as 358 mg L
í, concluding that 
nitrate is relatively harmless to fish. The im pact of toxicants on physiological 
parameters is likely attributed to a large number of environmental factors in combination with the fish  species. As stated by Kroupova et  al. (2005), Levit (2010) and 
Schram et al. (2014) the toxicity of ammonia , nitrite and nitrate depends on the fish 
species, the life stage and the fish size, amon g others. Furthermore, the type of rearing 
water (freshwater, brackish, or seawater) and the coherent relation between salinity of 
the water and nitrate uptake can possibly influence nitrate toxi city. However, the impact 
of salinity on nitrate toxicity has not yet be en adequately evaluated, as mentioned by  Chapter 1

  Davidson et al. (2017) and van Bussel et al. (2012). As long as the exact pathways of 
nitrate uptake remain unclear, the influence of  salinity on nitrate toxicity is questionable.

Table 1 - 4  demonstrates how diversely nitrate affects different freshwater and marine 
fish species. Additionally, it shoul d be taken into account that in  the majority of studies, 
rather young fish were tested. European sea bass of the prese nt study with an average 
initial weight of approximately 108 g were older and/or bigger in comparison to fish 
tested in the toxicity studies listed in Table 1 - 4 . The rather high tolerance of 
on-growing sea bass towards nitrate might demonstrate an increased robustness 
compared to other species shown in Table 1 - 4  (interspecific differences). Supporting 
Kroupova et al. (2005) and Levit (2010) it seems natural, that tolerance towards nitrate 
differs not only interspecific bu t also intraspecific. In general, older life stages are less 
sensitive to stressors such  as water pollutants than ear lier life stages (intraspecific 
differences) (Schram et al., 2014; Wendelaar Bonga, 1997). Comparative studies for 
the intraspecific influence of nitrate on health and performance parameters across 
various life stages and fish sizes are still insuff icient (Camargo et al., 2005; Hickey and 
Martin, 2009).  
Besides biotic factors also abiotic factors , such as nitrate exposure duration 
(acute toxicity or chronic toxicity), affect he alth and performance parameters of fish. 
Several studies revealed that fish can tolerate high nitrate concentrations ranging from 
116 to >3000 mg LíNO 3í-N in a short time period ( acute toxicity), while threshold 
concentrations of long-term exposure (chroni c toxicity) were far lower with 1.6 to 
358 mg Lí NO 3í-N Table 1 - 4 . For sea bass, Vectesi et al. (2012) observed no 
statistically significant change s in immunological and haematological parameters within 
a short-term 48 h exposure to 100 and 700 mg Lí nitrate (23 and 158 mg Lí 
nitrate-N). However, fish produced in R AS are exposed to increasing nitrate 
concentrations, resulting from the system, over months and years. To rely on LC50 
values as nitrate threshold concentrations wo uld be inaccurate for a RAS owner. To 
state threshold concentrations for fish prod uced in RAS long-term studies require 
further research (Davidson et al., 2014; Good et al., 2017 ). Additionally, as stated by 
Schram et al. (2014), threshold concentrations  derived from experimental studies 
should be applied cautiously outside the si ze range of tested fish species. Therefore 
further studies are mandatory to determin e nitrate threshold concentrations for different 
fish species and life stages produced on  long-term production cycles in RAS.

  4 Conclusion 
In the present study, a significant impact of  elevated nitrate levels of up to 500 mg Lí 
NO 3í-N HSI and DFI of on-growing sea bass  was documented. Our data revealed a 
significant influence of nitrate on HSI at concentrations >250 mg Lí NO 3í-N. An overall 
negative correlation of HSI an d DFI with increasing nitrat e values was significant. 
Furthermore, a trend towards lower SGR and hi gher mortality at higher nitrate levels 
indicates a potentially negative impact of ni trate on further health and performance 
parameters. Thus, for a long-term production cycle negative effects of increased nitrate 
levels on SGR, growth, and mortality can be expected. Therefore, long-term research 
covering a complete production cycl e in RAS is necessary to  determine the entire 
effects of nitrate. However, compared to  other aquaculture fish species recently tested, 
the sensitivity of on-growing sea bass tow ards nitrate toxicity seems to be relatively 
low.

  Abstract 
In recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) the high water re-use in combination with 
insufficient treatm ent of the process water can lead to the accumulation of nitrate, 
amongst other metabolic end products. For the e fficient removal of nitrate in a marine 
RAS, a Self-cleaning Inherent gas Denitrification Reactor (SID-Reactor) was 
investigated in this study. Within three consecutive experimental trials the effect of 
varying hydraulic retention time (HRT), ba ckflushing intervals (BFI), and carbon to 
nitrogen (C/N) ratios on w ater quality parameters and de nitrification performance 
(rate and efficiency) were monitored. Different HRTs of 2, 4, and 6 hours and 
additionally BFIs of 10 , 30, 60, and 90 minu tes were evaluated. Th e tested C/N ratios, 
realized using methanol (MeOH) as a carbon source, were 1.1, 1.5, 1.9, 2.1, 2.3, 2.7, 3.1, and 3.5 (mg MeOH per mg NO
3í-N). The experiments revealed that a HRT of 
2 hours resulted in the highest denitrification rate (497 g d-1 m³ biocarriers) but a lower 
denitrification effici ency of 64%. A HRT of 6 hours had highest denitrification efficiency 
of 81% but a lower denitrification rate (253 g d-1 m³ biocarriers). Furthermore, it was 
evident that backflushing intervals ever y 10 minutes resulted in a decreased 
denitrification efficiency of 29%, whil e intervals every 90  minutes increased the 
maintenance effort. Overall, backflushing i ntervals every 30 and 60 minutes showed 
the best results. A C/N ratio of 2.3 seemed to be sufficient to ensure an optimal 
denitrification performance, incorporating all single tested water quality parameters. 
The results of this study allow an easy, efficient and safe application of a SID-Reactor with the purpose of nitrate removal in marine RAS.

  1 Introduction 
Production of fish in closed recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) gained increasing 
interest over the last decades. This tren d led to an intensifica tion of production, 
simultaneously minimizing the environmental impact (Badiola et al., 2012; Bregnballe, 
2015; Dalsgaard et al., 2013). Contempo raneous, environmen tal regulations have 
tighten and especially waste water regulatio ns do affect RAS design and operation in 
terms of waste management (European C ommission, 2009). New and existing 
production facilities will have to  consider technical adaptatio ns to legal frames and 
improved RAS designs to fulfil regulations.  
Bregnballe (2015) postul DWHG WKDW ³VXSHU´ LQWHQVLYH 5$6 ZLWK D  GHJUHH RI
recirculation are trendsetting. This high degree of re-use of water is only possible if 
solid waste treatment and denitrification systems are ensured. Depending on the 
production site and the cultivate d fish species, high re-use of water can lead to 
problems concerning water quality. Accumulatin g metabolic end products of fish and 
bacteria can reach toxic concentrations for fish, if water consumption is limited and the 
cultivated species is rather sen sitive. For instance nitrate , as the metabolic end product 
of nitrification, could have a negative impact  on health and growth performance of fish 
at species-specific concentrati ons (Davidson et al., 2017 , 2014; Good et al., 2017; 
Hrubec et al., 1996; Kincheloe et al., 1979; McGurk et al.,  2006; Pierce et al., 1993; 
Schram et al., 2014, 2012; Scott and Crunk ilton, 2000; Shimura et al., 2004, 2002; 
Torno et al., 2018; van Bussel et al., 2012; Westin, 1974). 
A denitrification unit included in RAS can re duce and/or eliminate nitrate and its effects 
on fish and environment. Though uncommon 10 years ago (van Rijn et al., 2006), 
nowadays an increasing amount of denitr ification systems is applied to RAS. 
Especially, when high stock ing densities and low water re placement are followed by 
high nitrate concentrations. In general, rese arch on enhanced denitrification practices 
has accelerated within the l ast decades (Addy et al., 2016 ). However, conventional 
denitrification systems are an enormous challenge for RAS staff since maintenance 
and operation of these systems are challengin g. Therefore, the need for a safe, 
efficient, and easy to operat e denitrification system is ne cessary. Badiola et al. (2012) 
reported the major constraints on manage ment and future challenges concerning RAS 
in a survey, involving RAS based production companies, researchers, system 
suppliers, and consultants. Main limitations were  identified as: poor designs of the 
systems and poor management due to an absen ce of skilled people. As Lekang (2013)

  Research and development in the domain of water treatment technology produces 
sophisticated systems showing smart solutio ns for existing problems. For instance, 
Müller-Belecke et al. (2013) introduced the low-maintenance Self-cleaning Inherent gas 
Denitrification Reactor (SID-Reactor; patented  by Müller-Belecke and Spranger, 2014), 
which is also the subject of the current st udy. They tested the performance of the 
SID-Reactor with different carbon sources (denatured ethanol, methanol, acetic acid, 
and glycerin) and changing operational  modes (low energy demand, low carbon 
demand, and high performance). It has been demonstrated that the daily routine of 
operation and maintenance of the SID-Reac tor was simple and done within a few 
minutes a day. Hence, the SI D-Reactor is a promising denitrification unit for RAS. 
However, to make the SID-Reactor as safe and user-friendly as possible, it is still necessary to evaluate the influence of the most important operating settings to 
guarantee an optimized and sa fe denitrification process.  
In denitrification systems, the adjustment  of hydraulic retention time (HRT) shows a 
high impact on the nitrate removal rate and ef ficiency. While relatively long HRTs result 
in high denitrification efficiency (percent of removed NO
3--N) and low denitrification 
rates (total amount of removed NO 3--N per time unit), short HR Ts result in the opposite 
effect (Addy et al., 2016; Le pine et al., 2016; Oh et al., 2001; Timmermans and van 
Haute, 1983; Wang and Chu, 2016).  
When changing the HRT, generally two opposi ng scenarios can be expected. (I) At low 
HRTs a relatively high amount of oxygen (h indering denitrification performance) and 
nitrate (increasing denitrification performan ce) enters the reactor via the inlet water. 
(II) At increased HRTs, a relatively low amount of oxygen (promoting denitrification performance) and nitrate (lowering denitrific ation performance) enters the reactor via 
the inlet water. It is necessary to find a balanced setting where as much nitrate as 
possible can be treated without disturbing denitr ification processes by increased 
oxygen influx. 
Another major problem reported for biologi cal filter systems is the clogging through 
microbial growth and particul ate organic matter, thus limitin g filter performance (Alonso 
et al., 1997; Eding et al., 2006; Hozalski and Bouwer, 1998; K amstra et al., 1998; 
Lepine et al., 2016; Mara et al ., 2003; McMillan et al., 2003; Moretti et al., 1999a; Paller 
and Lewis, 1982; Rakocy et al ., 2006; Sastry et al., 1999). Conventional denitrification 
units based on the moving bed biofilm design or fixed bed design require a 
backflushing of the biocarriers to prevent clogging and breakdo wn of the denitrification 
performance. Backflushing of the denitrification unit is often accompanied by a severe  Chapter 2  
_____________________________________________________________________ 
- 39 - 
  change in environmental conditi ons for bacteria, causing a temporary breakdown of the 
denitrification performance.  
Safe denitrification relies on the accurate dosage (C/N ratio) of an external carbon 
source (in this study methanol), which is ma ndatory to fuel denitrification. An accurate 
methanol dosage is able to improve water qua lity by reducing the nitrate and rising the 
alkalinity. Under dosage will lower the denitr ification rate and stimulate nitrite formation 
(Hamlin et al., 2008; Sauthier et al., 1998; Timmermans and van Haute, 1983; Yang et 
al., 2012) as well as hydrogen sulphide production (Bregnballe, 2015), which are both 
toxic for aquatic species cultured in R AS. Based on stoichiometric calculations, 
anticipated 1.9 g of methanol is required to reduce 1.0 g of NO 3--N (Cheremisinoff, 
1995). Since the C/N ratio depends on several factors (e. g. type of carbon source and 
cell synthesis of bacteria) the de termination of an  accurate dosage is mandatory for 
safe denitrification processes in specific technical setups. 
 The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of (1) different HRTs, (2) varying BFIs, 
and (3) altered C/N ratios on  denitrification performance and water quality parameters 
in a marine RAS equipped with a SID-Reactor. Three consecutive trials were 
performed within one large scale R AS stocked with European sea bass 
(Dicentrarchus labrax ) to evaluate the operational settings and safe use of the 
SID-Reactor.    Chapter 2

  2 Materials & Methods 
2.1 Experimental Setup 
2.1.1 Recirculation Aquaculture System (RAS) 
The utilized RAS ( Figure 2 - 1 , 40 m³ in total, Kunststoff-Spranger GmbH, Plauen, 
Germany), was filled with sand-filtered, UV- and ozone-treated North Sea water 
(practical salinity: 24 - 30). Light regime was adjusted to 16 h light and 8 h darkness. 
Water from the ten rearing tanks (each 2.5 m³) was drained to a drum filter (60 μm 
mesh size) and further to a pump sump. To ensure oxygen saturation in the rearing 
tanks, an oxygen cone was included into the RAS. A Mo ving-Bed-Biofilm-Reactor 
(MBBR, 4.5 m³ total volume, 25 m³ hí water flow) was filled with 1.5 m³ of biocarrier 
(HEL-X®, diameter: 12 mm, surface: 859 m² m-³, specific surface area (SSA): 
704 m² m-³, density: 0.95 g, Christian Stöhr GmbH & Co. Elektro- und Kunststoffwaren 
KG, Marktrodach, Germany) for aerobe nitrification. Furthermore, the RAS was 
equipped with a skimmer (Helgoland 500, 11 m³ h-1 water flow, Erwin Sander 
Elektroapparatebau GmbH, U etze-Eltze, Germany) support ed by ozone (C-Lasky 
DSI/DTI, 10 g hí ozone, AirTree Europe GmbH, Baunatal, Germany). Water 
temperature in RAS was kept constant at 25°C by a heat exchanger. The pH was kept 
between 7.3 and 7.5, by adding sodi um hydrogen carbonate powder (NaHCO 3) to the 
rearing water. The oxygen saturation of th e rearing water was maintained on average 
>100% (>8 mg L-1), guaranteeing a suffi cient oxygen supply for the fish as well as the 
aerobe biofilter systems. Further water pa rameters (salinity, total ammonia nitrogen 
(TAN) and NO 2--N) were monitored and kept in a sa fe range in accordance to sea bass 
requirements summarized in Torno et al. (2018). To keep the intended basal nitrate 
concentration stable at 40 mg L-1 throughout the experimental trials, nitrogen in form of 
a 20% urea and 80% ammonia solution (CH 4N2O as powder, 25% NH 3, Carl Roth 
GmbH & Co.KG, Karlsruhe, Germany) was added to the system when necessary. The 
nitrogen was added directly into the MBBR with the help of an automatic dosage pump 
(RAININ, Dynamax®, Model RP-1, Rainin Instrument, Oakland, CA, USA).  Chapter 2

nitrification filter (8), and th e anoxic SID-Reactor (9). The wa ter flow is indicated by arrows. 
 
2.1.2 Experimental Animals 
Approximately 1700 European sea bass were obtained from neomar GmbH 
(Voelklingen, Germany) and acclimatized to th e conditions in the experimental RAS in 
the facilities of the Gesellschaft für Marin e Aquakultur (GMA) mbH (Büsum, Germany). 
Sea bass were distributed among nine out of ten rearing tanks at an average stocking 
density of 40 kg per m³. Fish were fed ma nually until apparent  satiation with a 
commercial feed (Aller Green, Emsland Aller Aqua GmbH, Gl oßen, Germany) twice per 
day, resulting in a basal nitrogen load  into the RAS. Feed ing rate was adjusted 
regularly to 1% of the total biomass per tank. 
2.1.3 Denitrification System 
The same Self-cleaning Inherent gas Denitrification-Reactor (SID-Reactor, 
Kunststoff-Spranger GmbH, Plauen, Germany ) was used for the whole experimental 
duration for the purpose of nitrate removal. Th e design of the SID-Reactor is based on 
a combined function principle of a fix bed as well as mo ving bed biofilm reactor 
(Müller-Belecke et al., 2013). The reactor ( Figure 2 - 2 ) had a total volume of 0.85 m³, 
whereas the water level in the reactor was adjusted to 0.75 m³. The SID-Reactor was 
filled with 0.45 m³ floating biocarriers (originating from the aerobe MBBR). The biocarriers resulted in a specific surface area of 386.5 m² availa ble to population by 
bacteria. Denitrifying bacteria transform n itrate into inert nitrogen gas (dissimilative 
nitrate reduction) due to following simplified chemical  reaction chain:

  2.2 Experimen tal Design 
2.2.1 Pre-Trial Phase 
After 60 days of adaptation of the sea bass to the RAS conditions denitrification 
processes were started within a start-up process divided into three consecutive steps.  
Within the first step, the SID-Reactor was operated without bi ocarriers and without 
methanol dosage to adjust basal hydraulic sett ings orientated on Müller-Belecke et al. 
(2013) for a period of two weeks. At this  point, the flow-through was set to 750 L hí, 
equal to a HRT of 1 hour. In a second step, biocarriers from the aerobe MBBR were 
added to the SID-Reactor chamber and the unit was operated for further three weeks 
allowing bacteria to adapt. During this period the flow-through was reduced stepwise 
from 750 to 125 L hí, decreasing the oxygen load into the SID-Reactor. In a third step, 
flow through was kept at 125 L hí and methanol was applied to the system based on 
the nitrate concentration of the rearing water, fi nally initiating the denitrification process. 
Subsequently, the experiment with three consecutive trials w as performed. Each 
experimental trial was started only unde r the premise that a st able denitrification 
process was present. 
2.2.2 Consecutive experimental trials 
Trial I: Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) 
Within the first experimental trial the aim was to evaluate the effects of varying HRTs on denitrification effi ciency and rate of the SID-Reactor. Three different HRTs of 2, 4 
and 6 hours (HRT-2, HRT-4 and HRT-6) result ing in nominal hydraulic loads of 375, 
188 and 125 L h
í, respectively, were tested. Water qu ality parameters were monitored 
(daily: temperature, oxygen saturation an d content, ORP, and pH; every three days: 
ANC, TAN, NO 2--N, and NO 3--N). Based on recommendatio ns of Müller-Belecke et al. 
(2013) biofilter media was back flushed ev ery 30 minutes for 30  seconds. During the 
first trial, methanol dosage was set to a C/N ratio of 2.7.  
Trial II: Backflushing Intervals (BFI) 
The SID-Reactor used in this study allowed to  adjust the time i ntervals of automated 
backflushing of the biocarriers from constant to every 99 minutes. Four different BFIs 
were tested in order to assess the SID- 5HDFWRU¶VGHQ itrification performance. Water 
quality parameters were monitored (every  two days: temperature, oxygen saturation 
and content, ORP, pH, and turbidity ; every four days: ANC, TAN, NO 2--N, and NO 3--N). 
Within the scope of this work a BFI consist of three phases:   Chapter 2  
_____________________________________________________________________ 
- 44 - 
  Phase I:  Initiation of biocarrier movement. To overcome inertia of 
biocarriers in the water column, th e side channel vacuum pump 
automatically runs for 10 seconds at full load (100 mbar pressure and 120 m³ h
í).  
Phase II:  Biocarriers are kept in movement for 30 seconds during an 
energy-saving, reduced operatin g level of the side channel 
vacuum pump.  
Phase III:  The side channel vacu um pump automatically turns off for a 
certain time period. 
Within the four tested BFIs, phases I and II were kept unchanged. The duration of 
phase III was altered to result in back flushing every 10, 30, 60, and 90 minutes 
(treatments BFI-10, BFI-30, BFI-60, and BFI- 90). Based on the results of the first 
experimental trial a HRT of 2 hours w as chosen. During the seco nd trial, methanol 
dosage was kept unchanged at a C/N ratio of 2.7.   
Trial III: C/N ratio 
For the heterotrophic denitr ification processes a 50% methanol (CH 3OH, BÜFA 
Chemikalien GmbH & Co. KG, Oldenburg, Germany) solution was used. In previous 
trials it was observed that the dosage of pure methanol led to clogging (not examined 
in closer detail) of the inlet valve. Theref ore, methanol was diluted with deionized water 
in a weight ratio of 1:1 resulting in a 50% methanol solution, avoiding the problem. 
Seven different C/N ratios, star ting from an assumed over dosa ge (C/N ratio of 3.5) to 
an under dosage (C/N ratio  of 1.1), were tested in following order within a third 
experimental trial as shown in Figure 2 - 3 . Water quality parameters (oxygen 
concentration, ORP, TAN, NO 2--N, NO 3--N, and TN reduction) were monitored daily. 
Methanol addition was adjusted to the actual  nitrate level every 24 hours. Every 48 
hours the overall methanol dosage was reduced by 0.4, resulting in the seven tested 
C/N ratios. The HRT was kept stable at 2 hours (375 L h-1).  
At the end of the first test series, the den itrification performance of the SID-Reactor 
was stabilized with a C/N ratio of 2.3. Hereafter, a second test series with the same 
ratios was conducted to prove the repeatability of the observations.

  2.3.2 SID-Reactor denitrification performance 
The overall denitrification efficiency is described as NO 3--N reduction in percent 
(Table 2 - 2  and Table 2 - 4 ). For comparison reasons with other studies the 
denitrification rate is described by the NO 3--N reduction in milligram NO 3--N per litre of 
treated water and hour (mg L-1 hí), in milligram NO 3--N per litre of tr eated water, hour 
and cubic meter of biocarriers (mg L-1 hí m³ biocarriers), and in gram NO 3--N per day 
and cubic meter of biocarriers (g d-1 m³ biocarriers) ( Table 2 - 2  and Table 2 - 4 ). The 
denitrification rate was calculated based  on the difference between the NO 3--N 
concentration of the inlet and the outlet water  of the SID-Reactor. Results for total 
nitrogen (TN) reduction are expressed in the same way. TN reduction was calculated 
based on the differences in concentration betw een inlet and outlet water, taking only 
TAN, NO 2--N and NO 3--N into account. Results for de nitrification efficiency were 
discussed in percent and for de nitrification rate in g d-1 m³ biocarriers. 
2.4 Statistical Analysis 
Since the present survey was performed in a unique technical scale production RAS all 
experiments are based on  a consecutive experimental design. Mean values and 
standard deviation presented in the tables are based on repeated measurements (=n) 
over the trial phase.  
To evaluate the optimum C/N ratio, a se gmented linear regression with one dependent 
variable (oxygen concentration, ORP, TAN, NO 2--N, NO 3--N, and TN reduction) and the 
independent variable C/N ratio was perf ormed. Statistical analyses were performed 
using SegReg (R.J. Oosterbaan, www.waterlog.info). The segmentation was done by 
presenting a break point, resulting in a broken line graph. The calculation of the optimum break point was based on  maximizing the statistical  coefficient of explanation, 
and performing tests of sign ificance. Statistical signifi cance of the segmented linear 
regression with break point was done by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and F-tests 
(p < 0.05).   Chapter 2

SID-Reactor, also representing the rearin g water, were close to equal for all three 
HRTs and showed only slight fluctuations. During the experimental trial, HRT-2, HRT-4, and HRT-6 resulted in average hydraul ic loads of 348, 181 and 116 L h
í, respectively, 
and were comparable to the nominal settings ( Table 2 - 1 ). The water temperature for 
all three settings fluctuated between 23 an d 25°C. The oxygen saturation in the rearing 
water was on average >100%. The pH was between 7.3 and 7.5, while ANC ranged between 2.4 and 2.9 mmol HCl L
-1. Average TAN concentrations ( Table 2 - 1 ) varied 
depending on HRT. The highest TAN was at HRT-2 (0.7 mg L-1), while lower values for 
the HRT-4 and HRT-6 treatment (0.2 and 0.3 mg L-1, respectively) were measured. 
Similar, average NO 2í-N concentration ( Table 2 - 1 ) was higher at the HRT-2 
(0.4 mg L-1) compared to the HRT-4 and HRT-6 (both 0.1 mg L-1). The average NO 3--N 
concentrations were 42, 33, and 49 mg L-1 for HRT-2, HRT-4, and HRT-6, respectively. 
3.1.2 SID-Reactor outlet water parameters 
For all three settings, oxygen saturation in the outlet was below 4% (0.3 mg L-1, 
Table 2 - 1 ). Furthermore, pH (7.6 to 7.9) and ANC (4.9 to 5.6 mmol HCl L-1) were 
higher in the outlet of the SID-Reactor compared to the inlet for all HRT settings. 
Negative ORP values (-125 to -145 mV) were measured in the outlet throughout all 
HRTs. Average TAN concentrations for HRT-2 (0.2 mg L-1) and HRT-6 (0.1 mg L-1) 
were slightly lower in the outlet compared to the inlet, while for HRT-4 the TAN concentration (0.3 mg L
-1) was slightly higher. Differences were more evident in 
average NO 2--N values. For all three HRT settings, NO 2--N values were higher in the 
outlet compared to the inlet. An average NO 2--N value of 3.9 mg L-1 was observed in 
HRT-2 compared to 0.8 and 1.7 mg L-1 for HRT-4 and HRT-6, respectively. However, 
lower average NO 3--N concentrations in the reactor effluent compared to the inlet were 
an indicator for denitrification processes for all three tested HRTs. The lowest average 
NO 3--N outlet concentration was measured for HRT-6 (10 mg L-1), followed by a HRT-4 
(12 mg L-1). The HRT-2 resulted in the highest average NO 3--N concentrations 
(15 mg L-1) at the SID-Reactor outlet.

  3.1.3 Denitrification performance 
With 81% the overall NO 3--N reduction efficiency ( Table 2 - 2 ) was highest at HRT-6, 
whereas both other HRT settings showed a NO 3--N reduction efficiency of 
approximately 64%. Taking into account the average NO 3--N reduction rate, rates of 
497 g NO 3--N d-1 m³ biocarriers were measured for HRT-2 and minor denitrification 
rates of 198 and 253 g NO 3--N d-1 m³ biocarriers were measured for HRT-4 and HRT-6, 
respectively.  
Similar, the overall TN reduction efficiency ( Table 2 - 2 ) was highest for HRT-6 (78%). 
The TN reduction for HRT-4 (61%) was lower, and HRT-2 had the lowest values (56%). 
The TN reduction rate was highest with 443 g N d-1 m³ biocarriers again for HRT-2, 
while the reduction rates for HR T-4 and HRT-6 were 190 and 245 g N d-1 m³ biocarriers 
respectively.

    3.2 Backflushing interval (BFI) influences water quality  
3.2.1 SID-Reactor inlet water parameters 
For all backflushing intervals (BFI-10, BFI-30 , BFI-60 and BFI-90) the inlet water quality 
parameters were comparable to each other ( Table 2 - 3 ). No differences could be 
observed for temperature (ranging at 25°C) and oxygen saturation (107 to 111%). Furthermore, pH (ranging at 7.3) and ANC (3.0 to 3.8 mmol HCl L
-1) remained 
unaffected through the course of the experimental trial. The highest TAN was measured for BFI-10 (0.5 mg L
-1), while TAN was slightly lower (0.3 to 0.4 mg L-1) for 
the other three intervals. Similar, NO 2--N was slightly elevated (0.5 mg L-1) in BCI-10 
compared to the other intervals (0.1 to 0.2 mg L-1). For the NO 3--N concentration, 
average values of 51, 26, 49 and 47 mg L-1 were measured for BFI-10, BFI-30, BFI-60, 
and BFI-90, respectively. Turbi dity was low for all four intervals (0.1 to 1.2 NTU). 
3.2.2 SID-Reactor outlet water parameters 
Outlet water quality paramete rs of the SID-Reactor ( Table 2 - 3 ) revealed several 
differences between the different BFIs. Oxygen saturation was highest for BFI-10 (5%) compared to the other three intervals (<3%). For all four intervals, the oxygen saturation was lower in the outlet water co mpared to the inlet water (>100%). ORP 
ranged from -152 to -217 mV for BFI-30, BFI-60 and BFI-90, whereas ORP for BFI-10 
was higher with -67 mV. However, for al l BFIs ORP was negative in the outlet water. 
For all four intervals, pH increased through out the reactor passage, showing lowest 
values for BFI-10 (pH 7.5) and highest for BFI 90 (pH 8.2). ANC (4.6 to 7.1 mmol HCl L
-1) was likewise higher for all BFIs compared to the inlet water. TAN 
was low for all BFIs, showing the lowest values for BFI-10 (0.2 mg L-1) and highest for 
BFI-90 (0.8 mg L-1). For all four BFIs the NO 2--N concentrations in the outlet water were 
higher compared to inlet water. The highest average NO 2--N values of 16.4 mg L-1 were 
measured for BFI-10, whereas for BFI-30, BFI-60, and BFI-90 low NO 2--N values of 
1.6, 3.1, and 4.3 mg L-1 were measured, respectively. Turbi dity of the outlet water was 
highest at BFI-10 (7.4 NTU) followed by BFI-30 (2.8 NTU), BFI-60 (2.0 NTU), and 
BFI-90 (1.5 NTU).

    3.2.3 Denitrification performance 
The overall NO 3--N reduction efficiency ( Table 2 - 4 ) was highest for BFI-30 and BFI-60 
(78 and 84%, respectively), followed by BFI-90 (75%), while BFI-10 had the lowest observed NO
3--N reduction efficiency (29%). The overall NO 3--N reduction rate was 
highest for BFI-60 and BFI-90 (733 and 629 g d-1 m³ biocarriers, respectively). BFI-30 
showed a reduced NO 3--N reduction rate (390 g d-1 m³ biocarriers) and BFI-10 had the 
lowest reduction rate (280 g d-1 m³ biocarriers). With regard to the TN reduction, BFI-10 
showed negative values for denitrification efficiency (-2%) and denitrification rate 
(-15 g d-1 m³ biocarriers), consequently indicating an increase of TN in the outlet water 
compared to the inlet water. Apart from this , BFI-30 and BFI-60 resulted in the highest 
TN reduction efficiency (71 and 76%), followed  by BFI-90 (65%). The TN reduction rate 
was highest for BFI-60 and BFI-90 (676 and 547 g d-1 m³ biocarriers), and lowest for 
BFI-30 (362 g d-1 m³ biocarriers).

    an optimum break poi nt was determined at a C/N ratio of 2.3 ( Figure 2 - 5C&D ) with 
concentrations of 0.1 mg L-1 TAN and 2.5 mg L-1 NO 2--N. At a C/N ratio below 2.3, TAN 
and NO 2--N increased up to 1.0 and 14 mg L-1, respectively. In contrast, TAN and 
NO 2--N outlet concentrations w ere approximately 0.1 and 2.5 mg L-1, respectively, for 
C/N ratios above 2.3. The break point for NO 3--N was present at a C/N ratio of 2.1 
(Figure 2 - 5E ) and a nitrate concentration of 8 mg L-1 in the reactor outlet. Increasing 
the C/N ratio result ed in stable NO 3--N concentrations in the outl et of the SID-Reactor 
of 8 mg L-1. Reducing the C/N ratio resulted in increased average NO 3--N 
concentrations of up to 35 mg L-1 in the outlet. Considering the TN reduction efficiency, 
the break point was determined for a ratio of 2.2 with an average TN reduction of 75% 
(Figure 2 - 5F ). Reducing the C/N ratio resulted in a reduced TN reduction efficiency of 
up to -16% (equal to a nitrogen i ncrease), whereas an increase of the C/N ratio

    4 Discussion 
4.1 Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) 
Hydraulic retention time is one of the most important operational parameters 
influencing biofilters, both nitrification (Eding et al., 2006; Summerfelt, 2006) and denitrification filter systems (Addy et al ., 2016; Christianson et al., 2015; Christianson 
and Schipper, 2016; Chu and W ang, 2011; Guo et al., 2017 ; Healy et al., 2015; Lampe 
and Zhang, 1996; Lepine et al., 2016; Oh et al., 2001; Plósz et al., 2003; Suhr et al., 
2013; Timmermans and van Haute, 1983; va n Rijn and Rivera, 1990; Wang and Chu, 
2016). Several studies showed  a high impact of HRT on diverse parameters of biofilter 
systems, such as TAN removal efficiency (Summerfelt, 2006), sulfate production (Christianson et al., 2015; Oh et al., 2001),  alkalinity production (Lepine et al., 2016), 
and the effect of C/N ratio on denitrific ation processes (Suhr et al., 2013), amongst 
others. The effects of HRT on denitrificatio n performance are unavoidable. A general 
recommendation for an  optimal HRT range cannot be given. The HRT range is highly 
dependent on the denitrification principles (autotroph / heterotroph / mixotroph), the 
reactor type and size, temper ature, and others. The influence  of HRT on denitrification 
processes should be evaluated for every denitrif ication type separately.  This was done 
in the first part of the experiment for the SID-Reactor. 
As most denitrifying organisms are facult ative anaerobe heterotrophs they have the 
ability to use nitrate as electron acceptor instea d of oxygen. In the presence of organic 
electron donors, and as long as oxygen is sufficiently available, bacteria will use 
molecular oxygen as electron acceptor instead of nitrate. Under aerobe conditions, 
oxygen is energetically favoured over nitrat e by these bacteria (Hamlin et al., 2008; 
Plósz et al., 2003; van Rijn et al., 2006).  Under anoxic conditions, nitrate is 
metabolically favoured as electron acceptor,  thus reducing each nitrate ion to one 
nitrite ion. Hence, oxygen is  an important kinetic inhi bitor of denitrification processes 
and possibly results in the production  of intermediate products such as NH
4+ and NO 2- 
(Guo et al., 2017; Hamlin et al., 2008; Oh  and Silverstein, 1999; Plósz et al., 2003; 
Yang et al., 2012). To guarantee stable  denitrification processes, it is essential to 
achieve anoxic conditions within a denitrifi cation unit. The SID-Reactor is designed to 
allow oxygen to solely enter via the influe nt. At a low HRT more oxygen is transported 
into the denitrification unit, compared to a higher HRT. Consequently, a low HRT could 
negatively affect denitrifi cation. Within the HRT trial, oxygen concentration in the 
outflow of the SID- 5HDFWRUUHDFKHGYDOXHVRIPJ/-1 for all three HRT settings. 
Therefore, it can be concluded that the wi de spectrum of heterotrophic bacteria was  Chapter 2  
_____________________________________________________________________ 
 
- 57 - 
    capable to reduce the influx of molecul ar oxygen of the inlet water, causing anoxic 
conditions in the SID-Reactor. However, wit hin the first part of the experiment, the 
denitrification efficien cy was decreased for low HRT-2 co mpared to higher HRT-6, thus 
indicating the negative effect of low HRT on denitrification efficiency. 
In anoxic conditions, a negati ve ORP is concomitant with effi cient denitrification. Lee et 
al. (2000) observed that nitrate is convert ed to nitrite when ORP drops below 0 mV. 
Hereby, nitrite accumulated through the range of  0 to -225 mV. From -225 to -400 mV 
nitrite was converted to N 2. However, optimum ORP value for denitrification seems to 
be dependent on the carbon source and the inlet water used (Drtil et al., 1999; 
Müller-Belecke et al., 2013). When etha nol, methanol and glycerine were used, the 
ORP sets in at below -120 mV. When ace tic acid was used instead, ORP sets in at 
-70 mV (Müller-Belecke et al., 2013) at a similar NO 3--N reduction. In a different study, 
Hamlin et al. (2008) also used methanol as a carbon source and the ORP value was 
between -20 to -150 mV. In the present tria l part, the average ORP values for the 
tested HRTs were within the recommendations for denitrification and ranged between -125 and -145 mV. The ORP values were no t actively regulated, but a result of the 
SID-Reactor in combination with  the experimental design. 
In RAS, the nitrification in aerobe biofilters le ads to reduced pH and a loss of alkalinity 
in the rearing water. To counteract this, alkalinity supplements such as sodium 
hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO
3) are commonly used. During denitrification processes, 
pH and ANC values tend to increase. This results in reduced use of alkalinity 
supplements (van Rijn et al., 2006). Within th e present study, no differences of pH and 
ANC increase were measured between the t ested HRTs of 2, 4 and 6 hours. 
As a first conclusion, all three tested HRTs resulted in low oxygen saturations and a 
negative ORP in the outlet water of th e reactor after adding methanol as a carbon 
source, enabling denitrification processes. Finally, lowered NO 3--N values, increased 
pH and alkalinity in the outlet water, compared to the inlet, were proved for all three 
tested HRTs. Hence, all three HRTs can be recommended for successful denitrification 
processes in a SID-Reactor. The HRT-2 and HRT-6 revealed lower TAN and only 
slightly elevated NO 2--N values in the outlet compared to  the inlet water. Slightly higher 
TAN values in the outlet compared to the inlet were measured for HRT-4. No coherence to HRT or other parameters can explai n this finding. A possible explanation 
could be a side effect, as a result of degradation of organic matter, occurring 
simultaneously in the anoxic environment.  This could result in the observed increase of 
TAN concentration in HRT-4 (Guo et al., 2017).  Chapter 2

    In general, elevated NO 2--N values are common in denitrification processes. They 
potentially indicate a limitation of carbon or an  inadequate HRT, resulting in incomplete 
denitrification, and an associated increase in nitrite (Guo et  al., 2017; Hamlin et al., 
2008; van Rijn and Rivera, 1990). As a co nsequence, denitrification units used in 
bypass in RAS, are able to affect the overall nitrite load of the rearing water.  In the 
present study, elevated nitrite values in the outlet water ( Table 2 - 1 ) did not affect the 
rearing water. A slightly el evated nitrite concentration in the SID-Reactor outlet did not 
affect the rearing water, possibly because this compound was easily oxidized in the 
on-farm aerobe nitrifying filter. At no time during the operation ti me of the SID, other 
measured water parameters reached harmful con centrations for sea bass in the rearing 
water. Thus, the three tested HRTs were suitable for the SID-Reactor operation.  
Since the tested HRTs resulted in pred ominantly equal water quality parameters, 
distinct differences between HRT-2, HRT-4, and HRT-6 ho urs were evaluated in terms 
of denitrification efficiency and denitrification rate ( Table 2 - 2 ). A relatively long HRT of 
6 hours resulted in highest relative ni trate reduction in percent (denitrification 
efficiency). On the contrary, a long HRT of 6 hours resulted in the lowest absolute 
nitrate reduction in g d-1 m³ biocarriers (denitrification r ate). At a HRT of 2 hours the 
opposite was found (highest denitrification r ate and lowest denitrification efficiency). As 
a consequence, an optimized HRT is no t the same based on nitrate removal rate 
versus nitrate removal efficiency. Thus, an optimized HRT depends mainly on the 
pursued objective. 
 As a result of the HRT trial the optimal opera tion of the SID-Reactor with regard to HRT 
reveals two feasible options. Targeting to reduce as much NO
3--N as possible in the 
whole system, low HRT of 2 hours (high hydraul ic loads) should be favoured. Targeting 
lowest NO 3--N values in the outlet water of the de nitrification unit, high HRT of 6 hours 
(low hydraulic loads) should be favoured.

    4.2 Backflushing Intervals (BFI) 
A general problem for most biological filters caused by clogging is the channelization of 
water through narrow areas of the biofilt er units, possibly leading to a completely 
blocked water flow (Paller and Lewis, 1982; Sastry et al., 1999). Shedding of biofilm 
caused by clogging can occur, causing high levels of fine  suspended solids in the water 
column (Eding et al., 2006; Kamstra et al., 1998). With regard to aerobe biofilter 
systems, clogging may reduce the nitrificatio n capacity (Eding et al., 2006; Michaud et 
al., 2006). For example, an aerobe decaying organic matter can cause an ammonia 
release, thus hampering the overall nitrif ication process (Rakocy et al., 2006). With 
regard to denitrifying biofilters, clogging may reduce the denitrification capacity. For 
example, Sauthier et al. (1998) reported  increased nitrite productio n and eventually 
increased nitrite concentration in the outlet water in proporti on to the amount of clogged 
biocarriers. Hence, the prev ention of clogging of biofilt er media is crucial to ensure a 
consistent and efficien t denitrification performance. The self-cleaning characteristics of 
the SID-Reactor allow to adj ust automated backwashing of biofilter media, resulting in 
reduced clogging, good denitrificatio n performance, and low maintenance.  
One result from the BFI trial was, that the BFI-10 had lower NO 3--N and TN reduction 
compared to the other intervals (BFI-30, BF I-60, and BFI-90). Furthermore, an 
enormous increase of the outlet NO 2--N concentration was noticeable, forcing a 
termination of the BFI-10 setting after 6 trial days. The observations made during the 
BFI-10 setting can be explained by the fo llowing facts. On the one hand, physical 
stress on bacteria could be the cause for decreased denitrification rates after 
backflushing. On the other hand, an i ncreased oxygen influx can change anaerobic 
conditions of a denitrification device to aerobic conditions, thus affecting the 
metabolism of bacteria. Physical stress on ba cteria generally results in removal of 
biofilm by fluid shear or abrasion of biomass by the collision of biocarriers (Camargo et 
al., 2005; Chaudhary et al., 2003; Hozalski and Bouwer, 1998). If the BFI is too 
frequent, physical stress possibly could have resulted in an excessive removal of 
bacterial mass, maybe even greater than ba cterial growth, thus reducing the total 
number of bacteria. The elevated turbi dity in the SID-Reactor outlet ( Table 2 - 3 ) at 
BFI-10 indicates the mentioned increased removal of bacterial mass. As a 
consequence of the decreased bacteria l population, the oxygen content and 
subsequently the ORP increased in the reactor chamber. This might have resulted in 
the observed formation of nitrite (Guo et al., 2017; Oh and Silv erstein, 1999; Plósz et 
al., 2003; Yang et al., 2012). This eventually  resulted in lower de nitrification efficiency 
and rates, as it was observed for BFI-10 ( Table 2 - 4 ). Furthermore, small amounts of  Chapter 2  
_____________________________________________________________________ 
 
- 60 - 
    oxygen can possibly enter the reactor during pressure compe nsation at times when the 
side channel vacuum pump runs in the course of backflushing. If the backflushing is too 
frequent, the amount of oxygen entering the SID-Reactor might increase. As a result, 
the rearing water in the denitrification unit is enriched with oxygen and consequently a 
higher ORP is present. This may have led to the production of denitrification 
intermediates (e.g. nitrite) and could explai n the decreased denitrification performance 
of the SID-Reactor.  
Low denitrification efficiency of 29% NO 3--N reduction ( Table 2 - 4 ) and a four times 
higher NO 2--N concentration (16.4 mg L-1, Table 2 - 3 ) was observed for BFI-10 
compared to the other BFI settings. The increase in TN (negative TN reduction, 
Table 2 - 4 ) for the BFI-10 setting, which can po ssibly explained by decay processes, is 
even more severe. Due to the lowered denitrific ation performance the positive effect of 
the denitrification on pH (van Rijn et a l., 2006) is also hampered. This can be 
concluded from the lowered pH for BFI-10 ( Table 2 - 3 ) in comparison to the other 
treatments. Hence, backflushing the biofilter media every 10 minutes is a too frequent 
interval.  
In contrast to results for BFI-10, backflushin g every 30, 60, and 90 minutes resulted in 
DSSURSULDWHORZR[\JHQRIPJ L-1 and low ORP of <-150 mV ( Table 2 - 3 ). 
Furthermore, nearly no intermediate nitrite production was observed for BFI-30, BFI-60, 
and BFI-90, indicating a good denitrificat ion performance. Hence, denitrification 
HIILFLHQF\RI NO 3--1DQG71UHGXFWLRQZHUHPHDVXUHGIRU%), -30, BFI-60, 
and BFI-90 ( Table 2 - 4 ), at a similar range. However, the denitrification rate for BFI-30 
treatment revealed a lowered NO 3--N reduction rate of 390 g d-1 m³ biocarriers 
compared to BFI-60 and BFI-90 trea tments with 733 and 629 g d-1 m³ biocarriers, 
respectively ( Table 2 - 4 ). Attributed to the lower initial NO 3--N concentration in the inlet 
for BFI-30 ( Table 2 - 3 ) a direct comparison with the other  BFI settings is hampered. 
Ideally, equal initial NO 3--N concentrations in the inlet water for all BFI settings would 
have resulted in more homogeneous deni trification rates, since  the denitrification 
efficiency in percent is comparabl e between the treatments ( Table 2 - 4 ). 
The problem of clogging is described in num erous studies as well as the need of a filter 
design preventing clogging and/or a method for removing dead biofilm with the aim of 
low maintenance effort (Alonso et al., 1997; Chu and Wang, 2011; Eding et al., 2006; Hozalski and Bouwer, 1998; McMillan et al., 20 03; Moretti et al., 1999b; Müller-Belecke 
et al., 2013; Paller and Lewis, 1982; Rakocy et al., 2006; Sastry et al., 1999; Wang and 
Chu, 2016). It was noticeable within this present study, that by increasing the BFI, 
bigger and denser particles were re leased from the SID-Reactor ( Table 2 - 4 ). Bigger  Chapter 2  
_____________________________________________________________________ 
 
- 61 - 
    particles led to increased clogging of the outlet tube, increasing the overall 
maintenance effort. A BFI every 90 minutes result ed in clogging of the biofilter bed as 
well as outlet tubing. For the ev aluation of the backflushin g intervals, the change in 
particle characteristics should not be unde restimated and considered in future studies. 
 As a conclusion from the BFI trial, it can be  stated that clogging of the SID-Reactor can 
effectively be prevented by regular backflushing of the biofilter media. However, a 
frequent backflushing (every 10 minutes) resulted in a collapse of denitrification 
possibly conditioned by shear fo rce and increased oxygen conte nt. In contrast, a rare 
backflushing (every 90 minutes) favour s clogging and i ncreased the maintenance 
effort. Thus, a BFI of every 30 to 60 minu tes can be recommended for the SID-Reactor 
resulting in both, good denitrification effi ciency and denitrification rates. A solution 
allowing an adequate backflushing techni que and frequency should be taken into 
consideration throughout the process of design ing of biofilter systems (aerobe and 
anaerobe). 
 
4.3 C/N ratio 
The performance of heterotroph denitrifi cation reactors depends on organic carbon 
sources as an electron donor.  Insufficient endogenous org anic carbon supply may limit 
the application of in situ he terotrophic denitrification. The addition of external carbon 
sources is essential in particular in RAS aquaculture (Lampe and Zhang, 1996). The 
correct choice of carbon source is a consisten t subject of several aquaculture related 
studies. The most commonly used carbon sou rces are acetate (acetic acid), ethanol, 
glucose, glycerol, methanol, and molasses (Bregnballe, 2015; Clifford and Liu, 1993; 
Hamlin et al., 2008; Klas et al., 2006; Lampe and Zhan g, 1996; Lekang, 2013; 
Müller-Belecke et al., 2013; Oh et al., 2001; Sauthier et al., 1998; Timmermans and 
van Haute, 1983; van Rijn et al., 2006, 1996; van Rijn and Rivera, 1990; Yang et al., 
2012). However, methanol is often preferred because it is relativel y inexpensive and it 
produces less sludge than other carbon sources  (Hamlin et al., 2008). Methanol was 
also chosen as the carbon source in the present study even though it remains 
objectionable in terms of toxicity (Kavir aj et al., 2004), especially at over dosage. 
During an over dosage non-metabolized m ethanol could pollute the rearing water and 
potentially harm the cultivated fish. Despite th is, non-metabolized methanol would also 
increase the operating costs of a R AS. Therefore, it is highly  important to avoid an 
inadequate methanol dosage when  operating a denitrification device.   Chapter 2  
_____________________________________________________________________ 
 
- 62 - 
    According to stoichiometry, the methanol dema nd to fuel denitrification is 1.9 g of 
methanol for each 1.0 g of nitrate-N, whi ch is equal to a C/N ratio of 1.9 
(Cheremisinoff, 1995). Since nitrogen and carbon are also used by denitrifying bacteria 
for cell synthesis, Kadlec and Wallace (2009) suggest an additional demand of 0.57 g 
methanol, summing up to 2.47 g methanol fo r 1.0 g nitrate-N. Timmermans and van 
Haute (1983) report a C/N ratio of 2.55 whil e Clifford and Liu (199 3) state an optimum 
C/N ratio of 2.7 resulting in >95% denitrif ication. Higher demand of 2.9 g methanol for 
1.0 g nitrate-N have been reported  by Theis and Hicks (2012).  
From the results obtained in this study, it is obvious that relating a C/N ratio solely to 
one single water param eter is misleading ( Table 2 - 5 ). Hence, it is necessary to rank 
the water parameters (depending on C/N ratio) according to their importance. The break point analysis for oxygen saturation an d ORP revealed a C/N ratio of 2.1 and 
1.7, respectively, to achieve lo west oxygen saturation and ORP ( Figure 2 - 5A&B ). A 
C/N ratio of 2.1 would also match with the break point for low NO
3--N concentration in 
the outlet of the SID-Reactor ( Figure 2 - 5E ). However, a C/N ratio of 2.1 or 1.7 would 
result in the production of intermediate prod ucts, since the optimum C/N ratio for TAN 
and NO 2--N is 2.3 ( Figure 2 - 5C&D ). Incomplete denitrification is associated with an 
increase of intermediate TAN and NO 2--N production (Guo et  al., 2017; Hamlin et al., 
2008; Oh and Silverstein, 1999 ; Plósz et al., 2003; van Rijn and Rivera, 1990; Yang et 
al., 2012). At high concentra tions, both intermediate prod ucts have the potential to 
harm the cultivated fish species. Therefore, a C/N ratio keeping all of the critical 
parameters in optimum ranges should be chosen.  
In conclusion from the C/N trial, it can be st ated that in order to determine a sufficient 
C/N ratio for denitrification processes it is necessary to take all relevant and 
denitrification dependent water  quality parameters into acco unt. The optimum carbon 
dosage should be determined under the guiding principle: as much as necessary, as 
little as possible. With a C/N ratio of 2.3 the oxygen saturation and ORP would be kept 
as low as possible and at the same time TAN, NO 2--N and NO 3--N concentrations in the 
outlet would show the lowest va lues. Additionally a C/N r atio of 2.3 would also be 
sufficient to result in an overall TN reduction as high as 75% ( Figure 2 - 5F ).

    5 Conclusion 
The determination of basal operating param eters and a deeper understanding of their 
effects on denitrification are necessary for one of the newest generation of 
denitrification devices in order to allow stable and efficient nitrate removal in RAS. The 
present work contributes to a better understanding of the effects of varying HRT, BFI, and C/N ratios on denitrification processes  and water quality when using a 
SID-Reactor. The main results of this study can be summarized as: 
 
x A HRT of 6 hours resulted in a denitrification efficiency of up to 81% nitrate 
reduction, but an overall deni trification rate of 253 g d
-1 m³ biocarriers. A HRT of 
2 hours resulted in a reduced denitrificat ion efficiency of 64%, but an overall 
denitrification rate of 497 g d-1 m³ biocarriers. 
x A BFI of 10 minutes resulted in an i ncrease of oxygen in the denitrification unit 
and an inhibition of denitrification processes. Fu rthermore, the increased 
physical stress resulted in an excessive  removal of bacteria, and concomitantly 
increased turbidity. Both, increased oxygen  content and removal of bacteria, 
resulted in reduced denitr ification processes that might even show signs of total 
breakdown. In contrast, a BFI of  90 minutes favoured cl ogging of biofilter media 
resulting in elevated maintenance effort. Henc e, a BFI of 30 to 60 minutes is 
recommended when running a SID-Reactor. 
x A C/N ratio of 2.3 is sufficient to keep  all relevant water quality parameters for 
denitrification processes in opti mum ranges with low production of 
intermediates. In general, one parame ter solitarily gives a misleading 
recommendation and might result in  non-optimal dosage of carbon source 
(C/N ratio).  
 
The results of this study allow an easy, eff icient and safe application of a SID-Reactor 
with the purpose of nitrate removal in RAS.

    Abstract 
An efficient and safe nitrate elimination by biological denitrification is still one of the 
most promising but challenging tasks in the development of recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). Solid-phase deni trification has proved to be a promising technique to 
remove nitrate from water and hence gained interest over the last years.  
The aim of this study was to evaluate  the replacement of methanol as a liquid carbon 
source by biodegradable plastic granulate made  of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA). In this 
study the PHA granulate was used as biof ilm carrier and as solid carbon source in the 
novel Self-cleaning Inherent gas Denitrification Reactor (SID -Reactor). An experiment 
was conducted over 110 days in three 1 m³ RAS. Each RAS was stocked with 
pikeperch ( Sander lucioperca ) at a density of 24 kg m
-³. The first RAS was operated as 
control without a denitrification system . The second RAS was operated with a 
SID-Reactor fuelled with methanol as ex ternal carbon source and the third RAS was 
operated with a SID-Reactor fu elled with PHA granulate functioning as biofilm carrier 
and carbon source at the same time. Using PHA as a solid carbon source in the 
SID-Reactor resulted in a maximum denitrification efficiency of 40% nitrate removal, 
achieved after 6 days. Using methanol as a carbon source resulted in a maximum 
denitrification efficien cy of up to 98% nitrate removal, achieved after 21 days. No 
significant differences were observed between the denitr ification rate for the PHA 
(1245 g d-1 m³ substrate) and the methanol (1042 g d-1 m³ substrate) fuelled 
SID-Reactors. Values for turbidity, total am monia, nitrite, and total organic carbon were 
lower in the rearing water, without any extreme values, using PHA compared to using methanol. Furthermore, both denitrification units caused an increase in alkalinity and 
pH, resulting in an overall 50% saving of  alkalinity supplements in contrast to RAS 
without denitrification. The r esults demonstrate that the functional principle of the 
SID-Reactor, usually fuelled with a li quid carbon source, is also suitable for the 
application with a solid carbon source.

    1 Introduction 
The accumulation of metabolic end products of  fish and bacteria gained an increasing 
importance in recirculating aquaculture sy stems (RAS). When water consumption is 
limited and an appropriate f ilter system is absent nitrate accumulates as a potentially 
toxic metabolic end product of bacterial ni trification in the rearing water of RAS 
(Davidson et al., 2017; Hrubec et  al., 1996; Kincheloe et al.,  1979; McGurk et al., 2006; 
Pierce et al., 1993; Schram et al.,  2014, 2012; Scott and Crunkilton, 2000; Shimura et 
al., 2004, 2002; Torno et al., 2018; van Bussel et al., 2012 ; Westin, 1974). Recent 
studies demonstrated the negative impact  of nitrate on cultivated fish species if 
maximum tolerance values are exceeded (Dav idson et al., 2017; Schram et al., 2014, 
2012; Torno et al., 2018; van Bussel et al., 2012). A possibl e way to minimize nitrate 
concentrations in RAS is an appropriate deni trification system. However, as reviewed 
by van Rijn et al. (2006) challenges for con ventional denitrification systems remain, 
even though these systems are establi shed since decades. No vel denitrification 
systems such as the Self-cleaning Inherent gas Denitrification Reactor (SID-Reactor) 
contribute to easy, safe and ef ficient denitrification in RAS (Müller-Belecke et al., 2013). 
The performance of denitrifying bacteria  depends on organic carbon sources as an 
electron donor. One of the biggest obstacles to  efficient and safe denitrification is the 
accurate dosage of a mandatory carbon source. Furthermore, numerous carbon 
sources are potentially hazardous, highly fl ammable, and cause al ong security risks 
during storage, transportation and operat ion. Additionally, a complex control and 
monitoring of denitrification processes and w ater quality parameters is necessary to 
avoid negative impacts of the denitrification unit on RAS water quality. For instance, an 
insufficient dosage  of the carbon source entails the risk  of intermediate denitrification 
product formation such as ammonium/ammonia and nitrite. Whereas an overdosing 
can pollute RAS water with i ncreased organic carbon loads. Hence, insufficient doses 
and overdosing can result in deteriora tion of the RAS water quality. 
Solid-phase denitrification in aquaculture ha s been shown to be a promising alternative 
and has gained interest over the past years (Boley et al., 2000; Ch u and Wang, 2011a; 
Gutierrez-Wing et al., 2012; P. Li et al., 2016; Shen et al., 2013b; Wang and Chu, 
2016). In contrast to conven tional denitrification systems, solid-phase denitrification is 
characterized by the use of solid water-insolu ble carbon sources. It is potentially able to 
resolve dosage problems, provides a stable w ater quality, and potentially decreases 
the nitrate-related negative impact on fish (Boley et al., 2000; Gutierrez-Wing et al., 
2012; Wang and Chu, 2016).  During denitrification the biodegradable solid carbon 
source is available for bacteria only by de composition and functions as biocarrier at the  Chapter 3  
_____________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
- 74 - 
    same time. The amount of organic carbon de composed by bacteria correlates with 
nitrate concentrations in the water column (Wang and Chu, 2016). Consequently, the control of the process is simple and the risks of inaccurate dosage are negligible (Boley 
et al., 2000; Chu and Wang, 2011a). So lid water-insoluble, and biodegradable 
substrates can be made from natural plan t-like materials or synthetic polymers. As 
microbial carbon and energy storage materia ls polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are 
expected to be easily metabolized by a broad variety of microorganisms under 
denitrifying conditions. Hence, PHA is discussed as being the most suitable solid 
carbon substrates for denitrification in water treatment (Gutierrez-Wing et al., 2012; 
Hiraishi and Khan, 2003).  
 The aim of this study was to evaluate the replacement of methanol by biodegradable 
PHA plastics in the SID-Reactor. The effect s on water quality and denitrification 
performance were compared between two SID- Reactors fuelled either with PHA or 
methanol. The replacement of methano l as a hazardous carbon source by a 
non-hazardous carbon source would increase safety  not only for fish but also for RAS 
staff. Furthermore, the possibility of free sel ection of either a liquid carbon source or a 
solid carbon source would prove that the oper ating principle of the SID-Reactor is 
highly versatile. 
2 Materials & Methods 
2.1 Experimental r ecirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) 
Three experimental RAS of identical constr uction were used for the experiment. The 
first RAS (RAS-C) functioned as a control and was not equi pped with a denitrification 
unit. The second RAS (RAS-M) was equipp ed with a methanol fuelled denitrification 
unit. The third RAS (RAS-P) was equipped  with a PHA granulate fuelled denitrification 
unit. The three used RAS (Figure 3 - 1 , 1 m³ in total, Kunststoff-Spranger GmbH, 
Plauen, Germany), were filled with tap water. Each rearing unit was equipped with an aerobe biofilter system. The system consi sted of a Hamburg mat filter (HMF), a 
Moving-Bed-Biofilm-Reactor (MBBR, 0.12 m³  total volume) filled with 0.06 m³ of 
biocarrier (HEL-X®, diameter: 12 mm, surface: 859 m² m
-³, specific surface area (SSA): 
704 m² m-³, density: 0.95g, Christian Stöhr GmbH & Co. Elektro- und Kunststoffwaren 
KG, Marktrodach, Germany), and a protein skimmer (Aqua Medic Turboflotor Blue 
3000, AB Aqua Medic GmbH, Bi ssendorf, Germany) supported  by ozone (Ozone 300,

    UV-light disinfection (Aqua Medic Heli x Max UV 55W, AB Aqua Medic GmbH, 
Bissendorf, Germany) was connect ed to the outlet of the aerobe biofilter system. To 
adjust the required oxygen saturation in the rearing unit, an oxygen diffuser was included into the RAS.

    2.2 Biodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) granulate 
In this study a polyhydroxyalkanoate polymer granulate was applied both as 
biodegradable carbon source and as substrate  for microbial attachment. The PHA 
(VVK Vertrieb Veredelter Ku nststoffe GmbH, Siegbur g, Germany) granulate was 
produced from renewable vegetal resources accordi ng to ASTM D6866 standard. This 
quality grade is according to the composta tion and biodegradation norm ASTM D6400. 
Furthermore, the PHA granulate grade was suitable for use in food contact applications 
in the European Union as a raw material wi th 1935/2004/EEC an d Plastics Regulation 
10/2011. Additionally, the PHA granulate was produced by using ingredients listed in 
Table 1 of Annex 1 of Plastics Regulations 10 /2011. No specific migration limits (SML) 
are listed for the ingredients. 
2.3  Denitrification System 
The design of the Self-cleaning Inherent gas Denitrification Reactor (SID-Reactor, 
Kunststoff-Spranger GmbH, Plauen, German y) is based on a combined function 
principle of a fixed bed and a moving bed biof ilm reactor (Müller-Belecke et al., 2013). 
The SID-Reactors used in this study w ere small scaled versions of the SID-Reactor 
used by Müller-Belecke et al. (2013) ( Figure 3 - 2 ) and had a total volume of 27 litres 
each. The water level in the reactors was adjusted to 22 litres. The SID-Reactor of 
RAS-M was filled with 11 litres of floating  biocarriers (HEL-X ®, diameter: 12 mm, 
surface: 859 m² m-³, specific surface area (SSA): 704 m² m-³, density: 0.95g, Christian 
Stöhr GmbH & Co. Elektro- und Kunststoff waren KG, Marktrodach, Germany) shared 
equally by the aerobe MBBR of the three experimental RAS. The SID-Reactor for 
RAS-P was filled with 11 litres (7.5 kg) of biodegradable PHA gr anulate, which were 
soaked in a separate water tank during a start-up phase, filled with tempered (25°C) 
tap water. The biocarriers provided a specific surface area of 9.5 m², the PHA granulate of 13.8 m² to be populated by bacteria . Each reactor chamber itself was 
closed with a gas tight top cover to prevent ox ygen influx by ambient air, enabling 
anoxic conditions. Addition ally, the nitrogen gas produ ced during denitrification 
accumulated at the top of the reactor chamber. Within a defined time interval, the fixed 
biocarriers and the PHA granulate were s wirled up. A side channel vacuum pump 
(0.145 kW, 4.2 m³ h
í, 1 bar, type: DTE3, Gardner Denver Thomas GmbH, Germany) 
forced the inherent oxygen-poor gas from the top to the bottom of the SID-Reactor and 
set the biocarriers and the PHA granulate into  motion. This w as done to prevent 
biocarriers and granulate from cl ogging due to bacterial growth (self-cleaning effect of 
the SID- Reactor). A mesh was installed in the upper third of the SID-Reactor, to 
prevent biocarriers and PHA gran ulate from flushing out. A small opening (Ø = 0.5 cm)  Chapter 3

    on the top of the reactor allowed excessive nitrogen gas to leak and furthermore 
allowed pressure compensation while the side channel vacuum pump was running. 
According to results of Chapter 2  the hydraulic retention time (HRT) was set to 2 hours 
and the biocarrier circulatio n interval to 30  minutes for both SID-Reactors. 
The methanol fuelled SID-Reactor (RAS-M) was equipped with a container (20 L) for 
methanol and a peristaltic do sage pump (Dynamik Series, Seko Deutschland GmbH, 
Mainz-Kastel, Germany) constantly adding me thanol to the influent water of the 
SID-Reactor. The flow rate of both SID- Reactors was adjusted by a diaphragm valve 
with a variable area flow meter (Georg  Fischer AG, Schaffhausen, Switzerland).

    2.4 Experimental setup and duration 
For the experimental trial pikeperch ( Sander lucioperca ) were obtained from Aqua Pri 
(Vejen, Denmark) and kept in a large scaled  RAS (40 m³) prior to the experiments at 
the experimental facility Gesellschaft f ür Marine Aquakultur (GMA) mbH (Büsum, 
Germany). For the experimental trial 385 pi keperch with an initial body weight of 
approximately 190 g were randomly distribu ted among the three RAS resulting in an 
average initial biomass of 24.3 kg per RAS. The pikeperch acclimatized to the 
experimental conditions for two weeks. Ligh t regime was adjusted to 14 h light and 
10 h darkness. Beginning with the second da y after stocking, pikeperch were daily fed 
243 g of a commercial feed (Aller Metabol ica, Emsland Aller Aq ua GmbH, Gloßen, 
Germany) by an automatic feeder. Feeding rate was adjusted at the beginning of the 
experimental trial to 1% of the total biomass per tank. The experime nt lasted 110 days 
(excluding acclimatization) and was divided into three consecutive steps. Within the 
first step (start-up phase) all three RAS were maintained without a denitrification unit 
for 53 days to allow nitrate accumulation in the systems. During the start-up phase 
attention was paid on d ifferences between the three tr eatment groups concerning the 
monitored water quality parameters ( Table 3 - 1 ). A higher nitrite concentration in 
RAS-M was traced back to a reduced water fl ow in the MBBR, due to a malfunction of 
the water pump. Hence, the water pump was replaced. After ensuring the same 
starting conditions concerning the monito red water quality parameters for the three 
experimental RAS, the second step (exper imental phase I) was initiated. In the 
experimental phase I (lasting 10 days) the SID-Reac tors were installed to RAS-M and 
RAS-P, respectively, an d basal settings were adjusted. As a third step the experimental 
phase II (47 days) was started by adding methanol to the inlet water of SID-Reactor of 
RAS-M. In both experimental phases water quality parameters ( Table 3 - 2  and 
Table 3 - 3) and denitrification performance ( Table 3 - 4 ) were monitored.

2.5 Data collection 
2.5.1 Water quality analysis 
For all three RAS data of water quality parameters analysis were collected for the 
rearing water equalling the inlet water of the SID-Reactors. Additionally for RAS-M and 
RAS-P data for the SID-Reac tor outlet water were coll ected. Total ammonia nitrogen 
(TAN, salicylate method, method 8155, Hach  Lange GmbH, Düsseldorf, Germany), 
nitrite (NO 2--N, diazotization method, method 8507, Hach Lange GmbH, Düsseldorf, 
Germany), and nitrate (NO 3--N, cadmium reduction method, method 8171, Hach Lange 
GmbH, Düsseldorf, Germany) were measured ph otometrically (DR 2800, Hach Lange 
GmbH, Düsseldorf, Germany). Furthermore , turbidity (NTU, PCE-TUM 20, PCE 
Deutschland GmbH, Meschede, Germany), acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) by titration 
of 0.1 mmol L-1 hydrochloric acid, and salinity (HI 96822, Hanna Instruments 
Deutschland GmbH, Vöhringen, Germany) were measured. Oxygen saturation (%), 
oxygen concentration (mg L-1), and water temperature (°C) (Handy Polaris, OxyGuard 
Internaional A/S, Farum, Denmark) were measured by sensors. Likewise, the pH-value 
(SenTix®41, WTW pH 3310, Xylem Anal ytics Germany Sales GmbH & Co.KG, 
Weilheim, Germany), and the oxidation-re duction potential (ORP ) (GMH 5550, GHM 
Messtechnik GmbH, Regenstauf, Germany) were measured.

    2.5.2 SID-Reactor denitrification performance 
The overall denitrification efficiency is described as NO 3--N reduction in percent. For 
comparison with other studies the de nitrification rate is additionally described by the 
NO 3--N reduction in milligram NO 3--N per liter of treated water and hour (mg L-1 hí), in 
milligram NO 3--N per liter of treated water, hour and cubic meter of substrate 
(mg L-1 hí m³ substrate), and in gram NO 3--N per day and cubic meter of substrate 
(g d-1 m³ substrate) ( Table 3 - 4 ). The denitrification rate was calculated based on the 
difference between the NO 3--N concentration of the inl et and the outlet of the 
SID-Reactor. The price ¼NJ-1) for both used carbon sour ces (methanol and PHA), the 
consumption of carbon source (kg kg-1 NO 3--N) and the costs of denitrification 
¼ kg-1 NO 3--N) are given in Table 3 - 5 . The costs of denitrification was calculated 
according to following formula:  
(1) RSC = TSC / TNR 
with RSC=Relative substra te consumption (kg kg-1 NO 3--N), TSC=total substrate 
consumption (kg), and TNR=total NO 3--N reduction (kg NO 3--N). 
(2) DC = RSC * SP 
with DC=denitrification costs ( ¼NJ-1 NO 3--1DQG63 VXEVWUDWHSULFH¼NJ-1). 
 
2.6 Statistical Analysis 
The present study was performed in un ique experimental RAS and thus, all 
experiments are based on  a consecutive experimental design. Mean values and 
standard deviation presented in tables are ba sed on repeated measurements over the 
trial phase. Statistical analyses were pe rformed using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 20 
(IBM Corporation, New York, USA). Data w as tested for normal di stribution based on 
graphical residual analysis and for homosced asticity using the Levene-Test (p < 0.05).  
With regard to water quality analysis, for normally distributed homoscedastic data, the 
ANOVA, based on the three treatments, was followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test 
(p < 0.05) in order to evaluate the di fferences between indivi dual treatment groups 
(RAS-C, RAS-M, and RAS-P) . For non-normally distri buted heteroscedastic data, 
Kruskal-Wallis-Test followed by Dunn-Bonferroni post-hoc test (p < 0.05) was 
performed in order to evaluate the diff erences between individual treatment groups.  
With regard to the denitrification performance,  t-tests (p < 0.05) for normally distributed 
data were performed to investigate differences in denitrification rate (in g d
-1 m³ substrate) between the treatment groups.   Chapter 3

3.1 Water quality parameters of the experimental RAS 
3.1.1 Experimental phase I  
During experimental pha se I all monitored water quality pa rameters of the rearing water 
(Table 3 - 2 ) showed no significant differences between the three tested RAS. Average 
temperature for all three RAS was 25°C and the oxygen saturation was >100% 
(> 8.5 mg L-1). Average ORP ranged from 152 to  155 mV, average pH ranged from 
7.4 to 7.5 and ANC from 2.5 to 3.4 mmol HCl L-1 for the three RAS. Turbidity was low 
(0.4 to 0.9 NTU) for all three RAS during the experimental phase I. Furthermore, low 
TAN (0.2 mg L-1) and NO 2--N (0.5 mg L-1) values were measured. The TOC 
concentration in the tested RAS ra nged between 8.7 and 9.7 mg L-1.

    3.1.2 Experimental phase II 
During experimental phase II ( Table 3 - 3 ) no significant differences for temperature, 
ORP, oxygen saturation and concentration were observed in the rearing water of the 
three RAS. Significant differences (p < 0.05 ) were observed for pH, ANC and turbidity 
of the rearing water. The significantly hi ghest pH of 7.7 was measured for RAS-M. In 
contrast, the lowest average pH of 7.4 was measured for RAS-C, which was not 
significantly different from the average pH of 7.5 measured for RAS-P. Similarly, 
average ANC of 3.0 mmol HCl L-1 for RAS-C was significantly lower compared to an 
average ANC of 7.1 mmol HCl L-1 for RAS-M. ANC for RAS-P was 4.1 mmol HCl L-1 
and not significantly different compared to the other two RAS. Average turbidity of 
2.6 NTU was significantly higher in RA S-M compared to 0.8 NTU in RAS-C. In RAS-P 
turbidity was 1.8 NTU and did not significan tly differ compared to the other two RAS. 
With regard to average TAN, NO 2--N, and TOC no significan t differences between the 
three experimental RAS were observed, possibly du e to the high standard deviations. 
In addition to average water quality paramet ers in the rearing water of the three RAS, 
Figure 3 - 3  shows the measured TAN, NO 2--N and TOC concentration in the outlet 
water of the two SID-Reactors over the duration  of experimental ph ase I and II. Several 
measuring peaks were observed for TAN, NO 2--N and TOC in the outlet water of the 
SID-Reactor of RAS-M. In contrast, no peak s were observed in the outlet water of the 
SID-Reactor of RAS-P.

    3.2 NO 3--N concentration and redu ction in the experimental 
RAS 
During the experimental phase s I and II the course of NO 3--N concentration was 
monitored in the rearing water of the three experimental RAS ( Figure 3 - 4 ). At the 
beginning of experimental phase I for all three RAS an initial NO 3--N concentration of 
approximately 130 mg L-1 was measured. At the end of experimental phase II, the 
NO 3--N concentrations for RAS-C,  RAS-M and RAS-P were 450, 50 and 160 mg L-1, 
respectively. For RAS-C a constant increase in NO 3--N concentration with some 
fluctuations was observed during  experimental phase I and II (trial day 54 to 110). The 
regression analysis revealed a positive linear correlation of NO 3--N concentration and 
trial day. No plateau phase was observed fo r nitrate in RAS-C during the entire 
experimental phase. Fo r RAS-M an increase in NO 3--N concentration was observed 
during phase I (trial da y 54 to 63), whereby no methanol was dosed to the 
SID-Reactor. At the start of  experimental phase II (tri al day 64) methanol dosage was 
initiated. However, NO 3--N concentration in RAS- M continued to increase to 
approximately 190 mg L-1 ± the first turning point (T1) at day 67 ( Figure 3 - 4 ). In the 
further course of the experiment, the NO 3--N concentration decrea sed to approximately 
50 mg L-1 - the second turning point (T2) at day 91. From trial day 92 until day 110, the 
end of experimental phase II, the NO 3--N concentration remained on a plateau at 
approximately 50 mg L-1. The regression analysis revealed a 3-segmented piecewise 
linear correlation of NO 3--N concentration and trial day. In RAS-P a constant increase 
of the nitrate concentration up to 160 mg L-1 was observed during experimental phase I 
and II (trial day 54 to 110). The regressi on analysis revealed a positive linear 
correlation of NO 3--N concentration and trial day. No plateau phase was reached during 
the entire experimental phase, even though the slope of NO 3--N increase was obviously 
lower compared to RAS-C.

With regard to the denitrification effici ency (in percent), several  differences between the 
methanol and PHA fuelled SID- Reactors were observed ( Figure 3 - 5 ). During 
experimental phase I no denitrification in the methano l fuelled SID-Reactor was 
detected. At the beginning of experimental phase II a denitrifi cation efficiency of 
approximately 6% was observed. The denitrif ication efficiency increased up to 
approximately 98% at trial da y 85, a turning point (T M) in the denitrification course. 
From trial day 85 to 110 the denitrific ation efficiency remained on a plateau at 
approximately 98%. Hence, 21 days had pa ssed from start of the denitrification 
process by methanol dosage, until denitrifi cation efficiency of 98% was reached. The 
regression analysis revealed a 2-segmented piecewise linear correlation of denitrification efficiency and trial day. In contrast to th e methanol fuelled SID-Reactor, 
the PHA fuelled SID-Reactor re vealed a denitrification effi ciency of approximately 6% 
already after connection to the RAS at the begi nning of experimental phase I. At trial 
day 60, 6 days after connecting the SID-React or to RAS-P, the denitrification efficiency 
increased up to approximately 40%, a turning point (T
P) in the denitrification course 
(Figure 3 - 5 ). During the further progress of the experi ment the denitrification efficiency 
remained at approximately 40% with some fluctu ations. No clear increase or decrease 
of the denitrification efficiency was obvious for the PHA fuelled SID-Reactor. The 
regression analysis revealed a 2-segmented piecewise linear correlation of denitrification efficien cy and trial day.

    Comparing the costs for denitrification ( Table 3 - 5 ) under the given experimental 
conditions it is evident that reducing 1 kg NO 3--N is 3.4 times less expensive using 
methanol than using PHA granulate. To reduce 1 kg NO 3--N 6.86 kg of methanol and

4 Discussion 
With regard to water quality parameters during  experimental phase I (trial day 54 to 63) 
no significant differences between the three tested R AS were observed. Therefore, it 
can be assumed that connecting the SID-Reac tors and setting them into operation had 
no negative influence on water quality and functionality of RAS components like the 
nitrifying MBBR. During expe rimental phase II (trial da y 64 to 110) a significant 
influence of both denitrifi cation systems on the pH and AN C was observed. In RAS, the 
nitrification in aerobe biofilters leads to reduced pH and a loss of alkalinity in the rearing 
water. To counteract this, alkalinity  supplements such as sodium hydrogen carbonate 
(NaHCO 3) are commonly used. During denitrific ation processes, pH and ANC values 
tend to increase. This results in reduced use of alkalinity supplements (van Rijn et al., 
2006). According to stoichiometry, alkalinity decreases by 7.14 mg CaCO 3 per 
mg NH 4+-N during nitrification. D uring heterotrophic denitr ification alkalinity increases 
by 3.57 mg CaCO 3 per mg NH 4+-N (van Rijn et al., 2006). Due to the stoichiometric 
calculation a saving of alkalinity supplements of 50% can be expected. To keep the pH in RAS-C stable at 7.4 it was necessa ry to add in total 3.95 kg of NaHCO
3 to the 
system. Nearly twice as much as the NaHCO 3 addition of 2.0 kg for RAS-M and 2.2 kg 
for RAS-P. Hence, a saving of approximately 50% in alkalinity supplements was 
documented for both RAS equipped with a SID-Reactor. Accompanied with pH, values  Chapter 3

    for ANC were significantly higher in RAS- M compared to the control, hence again 
demonstrating the positive influence of SID-Re actor denitrification on pH and alkalinity. 
Thus, both SID-Reactors showed a positive in fluence on pH and alkalinity stability.  
A possible negative effect of the methanol fuelled SID-Reactor on water quality was 
observed for the water turbidity in the RA S. Compared to RAS-C, turbidity in RAS-M 
was significantly higher. Turbidity measure ments can be used to estimate the growth 
parameters of bacteria (Métris et al., 2003).  Therefore, the increase in turbidity in 
RAS-M could be a result of increased b acterial growth condi tioned by increased 
organic carbon load in the system due to a methanol over-dosage. An indicator for 
imprecise methanol dosage is the total or ganic carbon (TOC) value in the SID-Reactor 
outlet water of RAS-M. During experi mental phase II, several peaks in TOC 
concentration in the SID-React or outlet water were measured. If methanol that has not 
completely been consumed by denitrifying bacteri a, is flushed out of the SID-Reactor it 
can enhance bacterial growth in the rearin g water of RAS. Connected to bacterial 
growth turbidity can also increase. As biodegradable solid carbon sources are only 
available to bacteria by enzymatic decompositi on, the risks of inaccurate dosage can 
be avoided (Chu and Wang, 2011a; Gutierrez-Wing et al., 2012; Shen et al., 2013b). 
Bacteria react to nitrate levels in the w ater column and hence use only the required 
amount of organic carbon necessary to red uce the available amount of nitrate (Wang 
and Chu, 2016). 
An increase of intermediate ammo nium and nitrite production in de nitrification units is a 
result of incomplete denitrification cau sed for example by imprecise carbon dosage 
(Guo et al., 2017; Hamlin et al., 2008; Oh and Silverstein, 1999; Plósz et al., 2003; van 
Rijn and Rivera, 1990; Yang et al., 2012). At high concentrations, both intermediate 
products have the potential to harm the cultiv ated fish species. Even though the higher 
TAN and NO 2--N values in the rearing water of RA S-M were not significantly different in 
comparison to the other two RAS, the influence  of the methanol fue lled SID-Reactor on 
TAN and NO 2--N was obvious. Taken together, observed peaks for TAN, NO 2--N, and 
TOC in the outlet water of the methanol fuelled SID-Reactor demonstrate the 
importance of accurate carbon dosage. Deterioration of the RAS rearing water could be 
a consequence, if dosage is not accurate. Fo r RAS-P with the PHA fuelled SID-Reactor 
none of these earlier mentioned negativ e effects were observed. This matches the 
conclusion, that PHA based granulates do not have a potential risk of releasing 
dissolved organic carbon and cau sing deterioration of effl uent water (Hiraishi and 
Khan, 2003).  Chapter 3

    With regard to the NO 3--N concentration different concen tration profiles were observed 
in the three RAS during the experimental tr ial. In a closed RAS without a denitrification 
unit, nitrate accumulates over ti me, due to the nitrogen lo ad originating from the fish 
feed, as observed for RAS-C. In a RAS equi pped with a denitrification unit with a net 
nitrate removal lower than the net nitrat e production, nitrate also accumulates over 
time, but at a comparable lower rate. This was observed for RAS-P. In a RAS with a 
denitrification unit having a net nitrate re moval higher than the net nitrate production, 
nitrate concentration decreases over time. If the net nitrate removal is equal to the net 
nitrate production a plateau phase is reache d. In RAS-M the last two scenarios were 
observed. At the beginning of the experiment al phase II the net nitrate removal in 
RAS-M was higher than the net nitrate production, resulting in declining nitrate 
concentrations in the RAS water. At the en d of experimental phase II a plateau of the 
nitrate concentration in RAS-M was observed. He nce, at the end of experimental phase 
II in RAS-M the net nitrate removal was equa l to the net nitrate production. In all three 
experimental RAS feeding regimes were eq ual, resulting in equal net nitrate 
production. Additionally due to identical flow through, the same amount of water was 
treated by both SID-Reactors. Furthermore , no statistical differences were observed for 
the denitrification rates of both SID-Reactors . Hence, the varying nitrate concentrations 
in the RAS at the end of the experiment  are most likely attributed to varying 
denitrification effi ciencies of both SID-Reactors.  
In RAS-P nitrate concentration increased from approximately 130 mg L-1 up to 
160 mg L-1. The PHA fuelled SID-Re actor reached relatively quickly a denitrification 
efficiency of 40% nitrate removal after 6 tr ial days. Hence, the PHA fuelled SID-Reactor 
removed approximately 52 to 64 mg nitrate pe r treated litre rearing water during the 
experiment. In RAS-M denitrification started at day 67  at a concentration of 190 mg L-1 
at a low denitrification efficiency of appr oximately 6%. Hence, the methanol fuelled 
SID-Reactor removed approximately 11 mg nitrate per treated rearing water at the 
beginning. During the course of the experime nt denitrification effi ciency increased up to 
98% at trial day 85. At this  point the nitrate concentratio n in RAS-M was 85 mg L-1, 
resulting in a nitrate removal of 83 mg pe r treated litre rearing water. Towards the end 
of the experiment nitrate concentratio n in RAS-M decreased to approximately 
50 mg L-1, resulting in a nitrate removal of 49 mg  per treated litre rearing water. Based 
on this, determining the average denitrificatio n rates for both SID-Re actors results in a 
similar nitrate removal in g d-1 m³ substrate.

    Using PHA granulate as substrate and carbon source at the same time, resulted in an 
immediate, though low, denitr ification efficiency of 6% after connecting the PHA fuelled 
SID-Reactor to RAS-P. D uring installation of the SID-Reactors to the RAS 
(experimental phase I) the SID-Reactor of RAS-M was not fuelled with a carbon 
source. If the endogenous amount of organic c arbon is insufficient to achieve stable 
denitrification processes in a denitrificatio n unit, an external carbon source is 
mandatory (van Rijn et al., 2006). Base d on stoichiometric calculations, anticipated 
1.9 g of methanol is required to reduce 1.0 of NO 3--N (Cheremisinoff,  1995). Since 
nitrogen and carbon are also used by denitrif ying bacteria for cell syntheses methanol 
requirement is above the C/N ratio of 1.9 (K adlec and Wallace, 2008). As reported in 
Chapter 2  a sufficient C/N ratio of 2.3 for st able and efficient denitrification 
performance of a SID-Reactor. TOC of approximately 10 mg L-1, representing 
endogenous organic carbon in RAS-M, di d not meet the required C/N ratio for 
denitrifying 130 mg L-1 NO 3--N. Hence, the present endogenous organic carbon 
concentration of the system was not sufficient  to initiate denitrification processes in the 
SID-Reactor in RAS-M. As consequence, the nitrate concentration in RAS-M increased 
comparable to RAS-C during experimental phase I. Three days after the beginning of 
experimental phase II a measurable decr ease of the nitrate concentration in RAS-M 
was observed. For the methanol fuelled SI D-Reactor the maximum denitrification 
efficiency was achieved 21 days after the start of methanol dosage.  
Several authors also report a lag-time unt il full denitrification performance is achieved 
when using biodegradable granulate as a carbon  source (Boley et al., 2000; Shen et 
al., 2013b). However, in other studies the start of denitrification process showed no 
lag-time (Gutierrez-Wing et al., 2012). In the present study a lag-time was observed for 
both SID-Reactors. It is obvious, that a col onization of the substrate by bacteria and the 
adaptation of the bacterial community to the environmental con ditions takes time. 
However, denitrification efficiency of  approximately 40% for the PHA fuelled 
SID-Reactor seemed to be low compared wit h 98% of the methanol fuelled 
SID-Reactor and compared to the denitrification efficiency reported in other studies. As 
summarized by Wang and Chu (2016) deni trification efficiency is commonly >90%, 
using different biodegradable polymers as a carbon source. Clogging and short-circuiting of a denitrification reac tor due to excess biomass production can cause 
a decline in the denitrification efficiency and are reported using denitrification units with 
biodegradable granulate as a carbon source (Boley  et al., 2000; P. Li et al., 2016). Due 
to the self-cleaning characteristics of the SI D-Reactor clogging and short-circuiting is 
prevented (Müller-Belecke et al., 2013; Chapter 2 ). With the SID-Reactor as  Chapter 3

    denitrification unit no cloggi ng or short-circuiting was observed for both SID-Reactors 
during the experimental trial, allowi ng a proper assessment of the denitrification 
performance.  
Although denitrification performance is often reported, a direct comparison of data is 
not accurate, due to the lack of information for environm ental situations and the exact 
chemical compounds used. Gen erally, there is a various number of different PHA types 
(Kessler et al., 2001; Raza et al ., 2018; Steinbüchel, 1992; Zhang et al.,  2006). It can 
be assumed that they differ in physical and chemical properties due to structural 
variations (Raza et al.,  2018). Furthermore, in the bi osynthesis of PHAs no pure PHAs 
of a single type are produced but rather mi xtures of more than one monomer (Raza et 
al., 2018). Hence, it is conceivable that  the PHA available in this study had a 
composition resulting in comparable low deni trification efficien cy. However, the 
differences of the diverse substrate groups can also be exploited by compounding. Compounding can result in improved physi cal and chemical prop erties and reduce 
costs (Hiraishi and Khan, 2003; Shen et al., 20 13a; Shen and Wang, 2011; Wu et al., 
2012). Next to compounding the optimiz ation of the surface-to-volume ratio could 
enhance the overall denitr ification performance (C hu and Wang, 2011b; 
Gutierrez-Wing et al., 2012; Hiraishi and Kha n, 2003). Increasing the surface-to-volume 
ratio could have a high impact on the de nitrification performance of the substrate, 
hence making the denitrification more efficien t by allowing a larger quantity of bacteria 
to populate the substrate.  
However, using plastics in aquaculture, even though of biological origin, could raise 
concerns associated with the intake of  microplastics by fish and potential contamination 
of the human food supply (Lusher et al ., 2017). Uptake of microplastics by 
environmentally exposed organi sms has been reported in a wide range of habitats, 
including the sea surface, water column, be nthos, estuaries, beaches , aquaculture, and 
the deep sea (Bergmann et al., 2015; GESAM P, 2015; Lusher et al ., 2017; Taylor et 
al., 2016). As reviewed by  Lusher et al. (2017) uptak e, movement and adverse effects 
of microplastic particles were observed in whole organisms and tissues, such as gills, 
intestinal tract and liver.  
For PHA likewise the hazard potential was ob served in several studies in different 
areas of research. These studies revealed that PHA and its degradation products have 
been proven to be non-toxic and are witho ut indication of carcinogenic effects (Ali and 
Jamil, 2016; Z. Li et al., 2016; Peng et al ., 2011). Furthermore, PHAs were already 
being used in the medical field as sutures,  cardiovascular patches, orthopaedic pins, 
adhesion barriers, stents, nerve guides, bone marrow scaffolds, wound dressings,  Chapter 3

    cellular growth support, and further appl ications (Ali and Jamil, 20 16; Chen and Wu, 
2005). Hence, PHA reveals best prerequisit es for the application in aquacultural fish 
production. Yet, in the present study the effl uent water from each SID-Reactor was 
processed in a biofilter system, removing particles from the water column, minimizing the risk of PHA particle ingestion by fi sh. Nevertheless, future research projects should 
clarify if PHA poses a risk for fish and whether the release and accumulation of 
substances originating from PHA have negative long-term effects on fish. 
Concerning the economic costs in this study on ly the cost of substrates were taken into

production systems. In the case of larger  purchase quantiti es lower prices can be 
expected. As reported in other  studies the price of biodeg radable plastics can start at 
just a few Euros (Boley et al., 2000; Wang and Chu, 2016).  
Furthermore, methanol dosage was probab ly not always precise with regard to 
fluctuating TOC values in the outlet water of the methanol fuelled SID-Reactor. Hence, 
comparing the consumption of methanol and subst rate costs difficult. At the end of the 
experimental trial a substrate consumption  of 3.36 kg PHA per reduced kg of NO
3--N 
was calculated. In this study the consumption of substrate is higher compared to other 
studies, but still in a similar range. Su bstrate consumption reported for PHB were 
2.9 kg kg-1 NO 3--N (Gutierrez-Wing et al., 2012 ), for PHBV 1.49 to 1.65 kg kg-1 NO 3--N 
(Chu and Wang, 2016), and for PC L ranging from 1.27 to 3.7 kg kg-1 NO 3--N (Boley et 
al., 2000; Chu and Wang, 2013 , 2011a). These differences could  be attributed first of 
all to the different group of substances, but also to differences in physical properties (e.g. density, surface quality, etc.) an d chemical composition wi thin a group of 
substances. Nevertheless, substrate costs  for denitrification processes with 
biodegradable polymers are more expensive  compared to conventional liquid carbon 
sources (Wang and Chu, 2016). The future reduction of production costs and 
compounding of biodegradabl e plastics with cheap organic substances will make the 
solid-phase denitrification m ore economic (Wang and Chu, 2016). Beyond that, to 
compare the operating costs of a methanol fuelled SID-Reac tor with a PHA fuelled 
SID-Reactor not only the price of substrat es has to be taken i nto account, but also the 
costs for process control, labour costs for maintenance, costs for safety precautions, and others.  Chapter 3

    5 Conclusion 
The results of this study reveal a great potential using a SID-Reactor in combination 
with biodegradable polymers as a solid carbon  source with the purpose of nitrate 
elimination in RAS. In contrast to conve ntional denitrification systems the operating 
principle of the SID-Reactor is not restri cted to use either a liquid carbon source or a 
solid carbon source. Using PHA in combination  with a SID-Reactor revealed several 
advantages compared to a methanol fuelle d SID-Reactor. Under the given 
experimental conditions start  of denitrification performance of the PHA fuelled 
SID-Reactor showed a shorter lag-time in contrast to the methanol fuelled SID-Reactor. 
However denitrification efficiency was lower compared to the methanol fuelled 
SID-Reactor. Furthermore, turbidity, TAN, NO 2--N, and TOC values were lower in the 
rearing water without any extreme values using PHA compared to using methanol. Future research should focus on further re duction of production costs of biodegradable 
plastics, compounding of different groups of sub stances creating new substrates with 
advanced physical and chemical  properties, and the evaluation of this new substrates 
in potential in RAS applications.

    GENERAL DISCUSSION  
Super-intensive recirculating aquaculture sy stems (RAS) offer a great potential for a 
sustainable and species-appropriate aquaculture, due to their highly efficient use of 
available space and water resources, and the control of most husbandry parameters. 
Nevertheless, intensive fish production is fo llowed by high accumulation rates of 
nitrate - a possibly toxic substance. Thus, th is thesis aimed to improve nitrate removal 
in RAS by using the novel Self-cleaning Inherent gas Denitrification Reactor 
(SID-Reactor). Furthermore, knowledge gaps  concerning nitrate toxicity to European 
sea bass ( Dicentrarchus labrax ) were filled. The results of the performed experiments 
are reported within three main chapters of this thesis.  
As a first step the influence of nitr ate on production parameters and health of on 
growing European sea bass reared in  marine RAS was evaluated ( Chapter 1 ). 
Subsequently, SID-Reactor denitrification performance was investigated with regard to 
hydraulic retention time, backflushing intervals and the carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio 
(Chapter 2 ). Finally, the possible replacement  of methanol by biodegradable 
polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) plastics in the SID-Reactor was evaluated ( Chapter 3 ). 
Increasing fish demand 
Fish consumption increased from 10 kg per p erson per year in 1960 to 20 kg per 
SHUVRQSHU\HDULQHQVXULQJDSSUR[LPDWHO\RIWKHJORE DOSRSXODWLRQ¶VDQLPDO
protein intake (FAO Fisheries and Aquacult ure Department, 2016). A further increase 
in per capita consumption of fish is estimated,  as it provides a key source of proteins, 
essential amino-acids and minerals, important for human nutrition. Hence, fish 
production has to be enhanced an d intensified to satisfy the future demand for fish. 
However, world capture fisheri es stagnate since the 1990s. The increasing demand for 
fishery products has mainly to be ensured by the increasing aquaculture fish production 
(FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Department, 20 16). A growth and intensification of 
production in turn will increase the pressure on present water resources and the 
environment. The increasing demand for fish cannot be realized using extensive and 
semi-intensive production systems. The lack of space for expansion, the limited fresh 
water availability and the tightened wastewater  regulations are considered as the main

    global fish production (Merino et al., 2012). As a conseque nce, sustainable aquaculture 
has to utilize natural resources, such as space an d water, in the most optimal way.  
Aquaculture contains the potential to enhance resilience of the global food system with 
the application of super-i ntensive RAS. These systems have a high degree of 
recirculation of up to 99.6% an d use as little as 300 litres or less of water per kilo of fish 
produced, involving sludge trea tment and denitrification systems (Bregnballe, 2015). 
Using these super-intensive systems allows th e greatest benefit of the available space 
and water resources. The diversification of aquaculture systems by farming a wide 
range of aquatic species contributes important elements of stability to the food 
production sector (Troell et al., 2014). A total of 580 aquatic spe cies, including 362 
finfish species, were farmed worldwide in  2014 (FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture 
Department, 2016). All in all, aquacult ure can contribute to a sustainable food 
production system, with the effective resource use , diversification of suitable farmed 
species, well adapted fish feeds, and species-appropriate aquaculture production 
systems (Troell et al., 2014). 
New fish species in recirculating aquaculture systems  
Efforts are made to explore the biological  and socio-economic potential of new fish 
species for the expansion of the aquacul ture industry (www.diversifyfish.eu; Robles 
and Mylonas, 2017). To ensure the best environmental condi tions during the 
production of a respective fish species, R AS provide several advantages. The wide 
independence of location, improved hygi ene management, good monitoring of most 
husbandry parameters, reduced water usage, nutrient recycling, and controlled waste 
management allow species-appropriate fish farming. Furthermore, the separation of RAS from the environment allows for a sustainable and environmentally friendly 
production of fish. With the aim to benefit fr om the mentioned advantages marine fish 
species, usually farmed in sea cages, are also  farmed in RAS (Blancheton, 2000; 
Martins et al., 2010). One of the releva nt marine species farmed in RAS is the 
European sea bass and was therefore cho sen as a model organisms in the 
experiments of Chapter 1  and Chapter 2 .  
However, production of fish in RAS bears several challenges. For instance, the low 
water replacement rates may lead to the accumulation of metabolic products of fish 
and bacteria in the rearing water (Deviller et al., 2004; Schram et al., 2014). Amongst others, steroid hormones (e.g. cortisol and testosterone), carbon dioxide, nitrate, 
phosphate, and heavy metals (e.g. arsenic and copper) are proven to accumulate in 
water (Martins et al., 2010; M ota et al., 2017, 2014; Steinber g et al., 2017). These and  General Discussion

    other metabolic products can impair fi sh growth and health at species specific 
concentrations. For nitrate, a metabolic end pro duct of the microbial nitrification, the 
negative impact at species re lated concentrations was already proven for several fish 
species (Davidson et al., 2014; Good et a l., 2017; Schram et al., 2014, 2012; van 
Bussel et al., 2012). Still, the pathways of nitrate uptake of fish is still unclear and should be clarified as mentioned by Davi dson et al. (2014) and van Bussel et al. 
(2012). However, until now only little is  known about the influence of nitrate on 
performance parameters and the health st atus of sea bass. Obvious, if European sea 
bass are produced intensively in RAS, they are exposed to elevated nitrate levels 
compared to conventional production systems such as sea cages. Therefore, it is 
necessary to determine how and at which concentration nitrate impacts sea bass. 
Consequently, Chapter 1  focuses on the impact of four tested nitrate levels on 
production and health parameters of on-growing  European sea bass. The results of the 
experiment have shown a sign ificant negative correlation of hepato-somatic index and 
daily feed intake with increasing nitrate le vels. Furthermore, for specific growth rate, 
and total mortalities a trend towards decrea sing specific growth rate and increasing 
mortalities was obvious at high nitrate levels. However, compared to other species 
nitrate has a low impact on European sea  bass production performance and health. 
Therefore it could be concluded that on -growing sea bass are rather insensitive to 
nitrate and thus suitable for RAS production.  
Additionally to the nitr ate exposure experiment in Chapter 1  an extensive comparison 
of current literature demonstrated that the negative effect of nitrate is dependent on abiotic factors like dura tion of exposure. For fish productio n in RAS the long term 
toxicity is of high relevance, since the cultivated fish species is exposed to potential 
contaminants over the long term production  cycle. Moreover, contaminant substances 
can accumulate in RAS over multiple production cycles over years and reach not 
naturally occurring concentrati ons. Hence, the introducti on of new fish species should 
be accompanied by the evaluation of thresh old values for the most important water 
bound chemical compounds based on data from long term experiments rather than 
LC50 values. Consequently, the experiment of Chapter 1  was performed in a long term 
experimental trial over 110 days.  
As discussed in Chapter 1  the negative effect of nitrate is also dependent on biotic 
factors like fish species, life stage, and fi sh size. Hence, further research is necessary 
to determine threshold values for diff erent life stages of the cultivated species 
separately. Additionally, cross-serial depe ndencies to other para meters (toxicants, 
water quality, initial health, etc.) can  amplify or weaken negative effects  General Discussion

    (Wendelaar Bonga, 1997). In this context it would be highly interesting to clarify the 
impact of salinity on nitrate tolerance of fish, as reliable data is missing. All in all, to 
clarify the impact of nitrate on sea bass an d other fish species in  RAS, experiments 
under production conditions covering a full production cy cle would be necessary.  
However, research should not only det ermine at which concentration a chemical 
compound impairs fish health and growth, but research should also contribute to a 
solution for these problems. 
Denitrification in next generation recirculating 
aquaculture systems 
During the production of fish in RAS, several chemical compounds are well-known to 
impair fish health. However, not only an imal welfare concerns, but also the economic 
loss are important for commercial production. Growth reduction and increased 
mortalities of the cultivated fish species are equal to an economi c loss. Furthermore, 
tightened wastewater regulations restrict  the production capacity of conventional 
systems (Dalsgaard et al., 2013). An appr opriate technical solution should be readily 
provided by the system designer or shoul d be available as a technical upgrade. 
Research groups contribute to knowledge gain  for removal of phosphate/phosphorous 
(Barak et al., 2003; Barak and Van Rijn,  2000), carbon dioxide (Moran, 2010; 
Summerfelt et al., 2000), heavy metals ( Jung and Lovitt, 2011), total organic carbon 
(Mook et al., 2012), humic acids (Kourdali et al., 2014), therapeutics (Aitcheson et al., 
2000), sludge and solids in general (Cripps and Bergheim , 2000; Summerfelt et al., 
1999), and others.  
As discussed in Chapter 1  nitrate removal is crucial, in the case of nitrate sensitive fish 
species or life-stages. With this objective Chapter 2  deals with nitrate removal of the 
novel Self-cleaning Inherent gas Denitrification Reactor (SID-R eactor), developed and 
patented by Müller-Belecke and Spran ger (2014). Based on the results of Chapter 1  
sea bass were chosen as a model organisms for the experiments. Particularly because 
sea bass demonstrated to be less sensitive towards nitrate compared to other species, 
sea bass was a qualified fish speci es for the experiments of Chapter 2 . Using sea bass 
it was assumed that animal welfare aspects du ring the trials were affected as little as 
possible regarding nitrate exposure. Prove of the SID-Reactor denitrification concept 
was already reported by Müller-Belecke et al . (2013). In this thesis experiments were 
performed to evaluate the influence of changing basal operating parameters on water 
quality and denitrification performance of the SID-Reactor. The overall performance of  General Discussion

    biofilters in RAS is affected amongst other by the hydraulic retention time (HRT) 
(Addy et al., 2016; Lepine et al., 2016; Oh et al.,  2001; Timmermans and van Haute, 
1983; Wang and Chu, 2016) an d backflushing of the filter substrate against clogging 
(Alonso et al., 1997; Eding et al ., 2006; Lepine et al., 2016 ; Mara et al., 2003; McMillan 
et al., 2003; Moretti et al., 1999; Rakocy et al., 2006; S astry et al., 1999). Results of 
Chapter 2  demonstrate that ideal hydraulic retention time differed among optimized 
denitrification efficiency (HRT of 6 hours) and denitrification rate (HRT of 2 hours). 
Backflushing intervals (BFI) every 30 to 60 minutes prevented biofilter clogging and 
resulted in denitrification efficiency up to 84%.  
Next to HRT and BFI settings the additi on of external carbon sources is essential for 
heterotrophic denitrification in RAS aquacul ture (Lampe and Zhang, 1996). However, 
inaccurate dosage results in deterioration of  RAS water (Hamlin et al., 2008; Kaviraj et 
al., 2004; Sauthier et al., 1998; Timmermans and van Haute, 1983; Yang et al., 2012). The correct dosage of the carbon source dete rmines whether a de nitrification unit 
influences fish production positi ve or negative. As described in Chapter 2  the C/N ratio 
was determined by segmented linear regressi on and revealed a methanol requirement 
of 2.3 mg MeOH per 1.0 mg NO
3--N, when considering common water quality 
parameters in RAS.  
By adjustment of the basal operating setti ngs and technical improvements the nitrate 
removal of the SID-Reactor w as nearly doubled from 451 g NO 3--N per m³ moving bed 
volume and day reported by (Müller-Be lecke et al., 2013) up to 870 g NO 3--N per m³ 
moving bed volume achieved within this thes is. Furthermore, the evaluation of basal 
operating parameters helped to guarantee stab le, efficient, and sa fe application of the 
SID-Reactor in RAS. Moreover, the results are also valuable for the operation of other denitrification units. 
Polyhydroxyalkanoate in the SID-Reactor  
As reported in Chapter 2 , one of the biggest obstacles identified by researchers and 
confirmed by producers, is the negative impact of inaccurate dosage of the mandatory 
carbon source (Hamlin et al., 2008; Kaviraj et al., 2004; Sauthier et al., 1998; 
Timmermans and van Haute, 1983; Yang et al., 2012). Therefore a complex control and monitoring of denitrification processes  and water quality parameters is 
indispensable to ensure accurate dosage of  the carbon source. In addition, numerous 
carbon sources are potentially hazardous to fish an d RAS staff, highly flammable, and 
can cause security risks during storage, transportati on, and operation. Solid-phase 
denitrification has proved to be a promising alternative to remove nitrate from water,  General Discussion  
_____________________________________________________________________ 
- 104 - 
    excluding the above mentioned obstacles (Hir aishi and Khan, 2003; Ho riba et al., 2005; 
Wang and Chu, 2016). In solid phase deni trification, biodegradable polymers are used 
as carbon source and biofilm carrier for denitrif ying microorganisms at the same time 
(Wang and Chu, 2016). The design and the operation principle of denitrification 
systems is usually restricted to a certain type of carbon source, liquid or solid. Chapter 3  demonstrates that the operation princi ple of the SID-Reactor is, in contrast 
to conventional denitrification systems, not r estricted to either carbon source. During 
the experimental trials, the removal of nitrate was achieved by using 
polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) in the SID-Reac tor. PHA was proven to be a safe and 
easy to use carbon source, while the of th e SID-Reactor shows advantages compared 
to conventional systems. The combination of  PHA and the SID-Reactor could make 
denitrification a natural part of future RAS. Concerning solid -phase denitrification in the 
SID-Reactor, future research could enhance  the application of biodegradable plastics. 
Results of Chapter 3  show that three topics need to be improved using PHA granulate 
as a carbon source. 
First of all, costs of the PHA granulate ha ve to be reduced in order to make it 
economically more attractive. Substrate co sts for PHA were 3.4 times higher compared 
to methanol within this study. The costs of the carbon sources used are not fully 
representative for economically working R AS, since bulk purchase in commercial RAS 
is more profitable. Nevertheless, raw mate rial prices are significantly higher for 
biodegradable plastics compared to conventional carbon sources. Although as stated in Chapter 3 , to compare the actual costs of meth anol fuelled SID-Reactor with a PHA 
fuelled SID-Reactor not only the price of su bstrates has to be taken into account, but 
also the costs for process control, labour costs for maintenance, costs for safety precautions, and others. Reducing productio n cost for biodegradable plastics would 
consequently also reduce operation costs. Ne vertheless, an assessment of all factors 
of costs would show the real  expenses for denitrification using biodegradable plastics. 
Second, the denitrification  efficiency while using PHA as a carbon source could be 
improved by compounding differen t substances. Results of Chapter 3  revealed a 
denitrification efficien cy of approximately 40% for the PHA fuelled SID-Reactor. This is 
low compared to the denitrification efficiency of  98% observed for the methanol fuelled 
SID-Reactor and compared to the denitrifi cation efficiencies reported in other studies 
summarized by Wang and Chu (2016). The lo w denitrification effici ency could be the 
result of a slow biodeg radation by bact eria. Chemical structure, molecular weight, glass 
transition temperature, melting temperature , elasticity, crystallinity, surface area, 
hydrophilic, and hydrophobic properties are chemical and physical properties  General Discussion

    influencing biodegradation (Tokiwa et al., 2009). Compounding different groups of 
substances can result in new physi cal and chemical properties increasing 
biodegradation (Tokiwa et al., 2009). Ta rgeting particularly denitrification processes in 
RAS compounding of biodegradable plastics can  contribute to customized solutions. 
Beside substrate costs and compounding, the th ird topic should deal with the material 
surface, which also influences the biodegra dation rate. Biodegradation of solid 
materials occurs on the surface. The bi odegradation rate i ncreases with increasing 
available surface area of the substrate (China glia et al., 2018). Biofilter media, used in 
RAS applications, is characterized by a high  specific surface area (surface area per 
unit volume, m2 m-3) where biofilm can be establi shed. Especially the protected 
surface, where the bacterial film is protected fr om abrasion, is important in this context. 
Conventional biofilter media presents a very complex structure ( Figure GD - 1A ). In 
contrast, the used PHA granulate has no protect ed surface area, due to its cylindrical 
structure ( Figure GD - 1B ). Hence, colonization by bacteria  is not optimal. Processing 
of PHA to a complex structure could increase de nitrification by biod egradation, due to 
increased protected specific surface area.

    However, not only the available surface area  has an influence on bacterial attachment, 
but also the surface structure. New PHA gran ulate has a rather smooth surface with 
small unevenness ( Figure GD - 2A ), whereas used PHA granulate has cavities caused 
by bacterial degradation ( Figure GD - 2B ). These cavities po ssibly contribute to 
increased bacterial colonization providing protec tion from abrasion. Hence, processing 
of PHA granulate resulting in a rough surf ace should be favoured. As reported in 
Chapter 3  final denitrification efficiency of th e PHA fuelled SID-Reactor was reached 
after a lag-time. This delay was explained by the natural course of bacterial growth. 
However, the formation of cavities could  possibly promote bacteria l growth and should 
be investigated in more detail in the future.

Key factors contributing to a future appl ication of biodegradable plastics in RAS 
denitrification systems will be cost reductio n of the substrate, improvement of chemical 
properties (compounding), and physi cal properties (protected surface area and 
structure). Once those obstacles have be en overcome, the SID-Reactor in combination 
with biodegradable plastics as biofilm carrier and solid carbon source will set a new 
standard in terms of RAS denitrification.

    Knowledge transfer 
Most research studies are usually  conducted in laboratory systems to generate reliable 
data. Laboratory systems (short-term, small- scale, and single-factor) can only partially 
simulate conditions in commer cial RAS (long-term, large scale, and multi-factor), thus 
up-scaling of results is difficul t (Colt, 2006; van Rijn et al.,  2006; Zhu and Chen, 1999). 
In this context, a close cooperation be tween research and industry, involving 
producers, would be highly recommendable and could accelerate knowledge gain 
(Badiola et al., 2012).  
During this thesis a high degree of kn owledge transfer was striven for. Through 
published journal articles, presentations at con ferences, and information events results 
of this thesis were made accessible to speci alists, the interested public and customers 
of the SID-Reactor. Next to the scien tific output the cl ose contact to producers, 
research facilities, commercial sea-life centr es, and the Spranger-Kunststoffe GmbH 
(project partner and manufacturer of the SID-Reactor) guaranteed a practice-oriented 
processing of the whole project. Resulting from this close contact and onsite instruction 
of clients, a SID-Reactor manual was written.  The manual consist of different chapters, 
dealing with general information on SID- Reactor technique and biological background, 
explaining the start-up process, the infl uence of operating parameters, maintenance, 
and troubleshooting. Continuous knowledge ga in by experiments and feedback of the 
clients contribute to a constant improvement of the manual. 
Further research 
During the experiments a shift in the bacterial community wi th operation time and in 
comparison to the aerobe MBBR was observed (u npublished data). A detailed analysis 
of the bacterial community would be a highly valuable knowledge gain. Having knowledge about the bacterial community an d the needed environmental conditions 
would allow a targeted improvement of removal processes.  
Within this thesis, the main focus was the use of the SID-Reactor for nitrate removal. 
Obviously, bacteria are also capable of metabolic pathways processing other 
substances from their environment. Ther e are some indications, that the SID-Reactor 
potentially removes substances (2-methylisob orneol and geosmin) responsible for 
off-flavour (unpublished data). Furthermore, it would be highly interesting to investigate 
whether and which other undesi rable substances in RAS could  be removed by bacteria 
under anoxic conditions in the SID-Reacto r. Some other undesi rable substances could 
be phosphorous, humic acids, and therapeutics.  General Discussion  
_____________________________________________________________________

    Another research subject could be the simu ltaneous nitrification and denitrification 
(SND) in the SID-Reactor. Walters et al . (2009) demonstrated SND processes in a 
biological reactor with biodegradable carr ier material. An efficient SND process in the 
SID-Reactor would make an aerobe biof ilter system in the RAS superfluous. 
Simultaneous nitrification an d denitrification in one bi ofilter unit would reduce 
acquisition and operation cost of a RAS, increasing its profitability. 
Conclusion 
With the help of the results gained in th is thesis knowledge gaps were filled concerning 
the nitrate toxicity to Europea n sea bass, showing that sea bass is a promising species 
for RAS production. Furthermore, the SID-Reactor contribut es to the advancement of 
RAS and helps to keep up with  the intensification of fish prod uction. In addi tion, further 
research could open up new application fields for the SID-Reactor. All in all, the 
development of state-of-the-art water treatment systems will result in future-oriented RAS, crucial to achieve sustaina ble growth of aquaculture.   General Discussion

    SUMMARY  
The demand for fishery products is increasing constantly since decades. Hence, the 
future challenge for the fish production industry will be to satisfy this need for fish, a key 
source of protein, essential amino-acids, and minerals. Beca use, world capture 
fisheries stagnate since the 90s, the i ncreasing demand for fishery products has to be 
ensured predominantly by the aquaculture production. 
Present land based aquaculture production syst ems can be categorized into extensive, 
semi-intensive, intensive, an d super-intensive systems. The latter have the highest 
production of fish per used water volume and thus use the available space and water 
resources most efficien t. Furthermore, the independence of recirculating aquaculture 
systems (RAS) from the environment keeps their environmental impact as low as 
possible and allows the control of all husbandry conditions during fish production. 
However, production of fish in RAS be ars also several obstacles. Modern 
super-intensive RAS are char acterized by a high water re-use coming along with 
intensification of fish production. The recycling of rearing water results in the 
accumulation of metabolic end products of fi sh and bacteria in the water column. One 
metabolic end product is nitrate, which is fo rmed during biological nitrification process. 
Nitrate influences various physiological parameters of fish at species related 
concentrations.  
This thesis first evaluates possible eff ects of nitrate on a marine fish species 
(Chapter 1 ). Furthermore, nitrate removal using the Self-cleaning Inherent gas 
Denitrification Reactor (SID-Rea ctor) was investigated. To allow stable and efficient 
nitrate removal using the SID-Reactor, ba sal operation parameters were evaluated and 
a deeper understanding of thei r effects on denitrification and water quality was striven 
for (Chapter 2 ). Additionally, to excl ude the risk of incorrect dosing of potentially 
hazardous carbon sources, mandatory for heterotrop hic denitrification, it was evaluated 
whether solid biodegradable plastics were suitable as carbon source for the application 
in the SID-Reactor ( Chapter 3 ).     Summary  
_____________________________________________________________________ 
- 116 - 
    In Chapter 1 , the impact of nitrate on performa nce parameters and health status of on 
growing European sea bass ( Dicentrarchus labrax ), used as a marine model fish 
species, reared in RAS was evaluated. On -growing sea bass were exposed to four 
different nitrate concentrations between 0 and 500 mg L-1 in a triplicate experimental 
design in twelve small-scaled experimental  RAS for 10 weeks. At the end of the 
experiment, final biomass, final individual weight, condition factor, feed conversion 
ratio, and spleen-somatic index were not sign ificantly affected by nitrate exposure 
within the concentration range tested. Furt hermore, specific growth rate, and total 
mortalities did not signifi cantly differ between the trea tment groups either, although a 
trend towards decreasing speci fic growth rate and increasing mortalities at high nitrate 
levels was visible. The results demonstr ate the significant negative correlation of 
hepato-somatic index and daily feed inta ke with increasing nitrate levels.  
All in all, nitrate significantly impaired only for a few paramet ers monitored in this study. 
Hence, the sensitivity of on-growing sea ba ss towards nitrate toxicity seems to be low 
compared to other aquaculture fish species. Howe ver, in the case of fish species or 
life-stages more sensitive towards nitrate,  a nitrate removal via denitrification is 
essential.  
In Chapter 2 , nitrate removal in a marine RAS us ing the SID-Reactor was investigated. 
Within a consecutive experimental approach, effects of varying hydraulic retention time 
(HRT), backflushing intervals (BFI), and carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratios on water quality 
parameters and denitrification performance were monitored. During the first test series 
three different HRTs were tested. The experi ments revealed that a HRT of 2 hours 
resulted in the highest denitrification rate (497 g d-1 m³ biocarriers) but a lower 
denitrification effici ency of 64%. A HRT of 6 hours had highest denitrification efficiency 
of 81% but a lower denitr ification rate (253 g d-1 m³ biocarriers). Duri ng the second test 
series, four BFIs were evaluated. It was evid ent that backflushing intervals every 10 
minutes resulted in a decreased denitrificatio n efficiency of 29%, while intervals every 
90 minutes increased  the maintenance effort. Overall, ba ckflushing intervals every 30 
and 60 minutes showed the be st results. During the thir d test series, seven carbon to 
nitrogen ratios were evaluated using methanol as a carbon source. The results indicated that a C/N ratio of 2.3 was sufficie nt to ensure an opti mal denitrification 
performance, incorporating all single te sted water quality parameters. However, 
incorrect carbon dosing r esulted in deterioration  of water quality.  
  Summary  
_____________________________________________________________________ 
- 117 - 
    In Chapter 3 , the replacement of methanol as a liquid carbon source by biodegradable 
plastic granulate made of polyhydroxyalkano ate (PHA) used as biof ilm carrier and as 
solid carbon source was investigated. In the experiment, the SID-Reactor was used in freshwater RAS stocked with pikeperch ( Sander lucioperca ). Three RAS (1 m³) were 
used for the trial. The first RAS was op erated as control with out a denitrification 
system. The second RAS was operated with  a SID-Reactor fuelled with methanol as 
external carbon source and the third RAS was operated  with a SID-Reactor fuelled with 
PHA granulate functioning as biofilm ca rrier and carbon source at the same time. For 
all three RAS, water qua lity was documented and compared to each other. 
Furthermore, the denitrification performa nce of the PHA and methanol fuelled 
SID-Reactors were compared to each other. Valu es for turbidity, total ammonia, nitrite, 
and total organic carbon were lower in the rearing water when PHA was used in the 
SID-Reactor compared to methanol. Furtherm ore, both denitrification units caused an 
increase in alkalinity and pH, resulting in  an overall 50% saving of alkalinity 
supplements in contrast to RAS without de nitrification. Using PHA as a solid carbon 
source in the SID-Reactor resu lted in a maximum denitrification efficiency of 40% 
nitrate removal. Using methanol as a carbon source resulted in a maximum 
denitrification efficien cy of up to 98% nitrate removal. However, no significant 
differences were observed between the den itrification rate for the PHA and the 
methanol fuelled SID-Reactor s. The results demonstrate that the functional principle of 
the SID-Reactor, usually fuelled with a liquid carbon source, is also suitable for the 
application with a solid carbon source. 
 This study revealed a low impact of nitr ate on production performa nce and health of 
on-growing sea bass. For production of more nitrate sensiti ve fish species, the 
SID-Reactor is an appropriate denitrification unit. Safe, effi cient and easy to handle 
denitrification was demonstrated using the SID- Reactor. Based on the results of this 
thesis and the accompanying general technical improvements, denitrification 
performance of the SID-Reactor was enha nced. Additionally, general maintenance 
effort can be reduced if the results of this thesis are taken into account. Taking the 
application of the SID-Reactor to the next  step, biodegradable plastics were proven as 
a suitable carbon source and biofilm carrier at  the same time. The lower denitrification 
efficiency with PHA is negligible since th e operation of the SID-Reactor is predominant. 
The use of biodegradable plastics in the SID- Reactor is a forward-looking and state-of-
the-art approach for water treatment in RAS.

ZUSAMMENFASSUNG  
Seit vielen Jahren ist ein steigender Bedarf an Fischereiprodukten zu verzeichnen. Die 
zukünftige Aufgabe der Fischindustrie wird es sein, diesen Bedarf an Fisch, eine wichtige Proteinquelle, reich an essenziellen  Aminosäuren und Mineralstoffen, zu 
decken. Die weltweiten Erträge der Fang fischerei stagnieren jedoch seit den 90iger 
Jahren. Somit muss der wach sende Bedarf an Fischerei produkten durch Fisch aus der 
Aquakultur gedeckt werden.  
Aktuelle landbasierte Aquakultur-Produktionssysteme können in extensive, semi-
intensive, intensive un d super-intensive Systeme kate gorisiert werden. Die letzteren 
zeichnen sich durch den höchsten Fische rtrag pro genutztem Wasservolumen aus. 
Somit nutzen super-intensive Kreislaufanlagen (KLA) di e verfügbaren Flächen und 
Wasserressourcen am effizientesten. Des Weiteren können durch die Isolation der KLA 
von der Umwelt, alle relevanten Haltungsparameter während der Fischproduktion kontrolliert und beeinfl usst werden. Durch die Isolation wird  der Einfluss von KLA auf 
die Umwelt außerdem auf ein Mindestmaß reduziert . Der Einsatz von KLA weist jedoch 
auch einige Hindernisse auf. Mo derne super-intensive KLA sind  durch eine intensive 
Fischproduktion und hohe Wasserwied erverwertung gekennzeichnet. Durch das 
Wiederverwenden von Anlagenwasser können  sich jedoch Stoffwechselendprodukte 
von Fischen und Bakterien im Ha ltungswasser anreichern. Ein 
Stoffwechselendprodukt, das während der biol ogischen Nitrifikation gebildet wird, ist 
Nitrat. Sobald die Nitratkon zentration Art-spezifische Gr enzwerte übersteigt, können 
physiologische Parameter von Fische n negativ beeinflusst werden.  
In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde daher zu  Beginn untersucht, in welchem Ausmaß 
Nitrat eine marine Fischa rt beeinflussen kann ( Kapitel 1 ). Des Weiteren wurde die 
Nitrat Entfernung durch den Selbstreinigenden Inertgas Denitrifikations Reaktor 
(SID-Reaktor) untersucht. Um einen st abilen und effizienten Nitratabbau zu 
gewährleisten wurden dabei grundlegende Be triebsparameter untersucht und beurteilt 
(Kapitel 2 ). Zudem wurde ein umfassendes Verstä ndnis der Betriebsparametereffekte 
auf Denitrifikationsleitung und Wasserqualität angestrebt. Bei der heterotrophen Denitrifikation ist die Zudosierung einer Ko hlenstoffquelle unerlässlich. Um das Risiko 
einer Fehldosierung dieser teilweise toxi schen Kohlenstoffquellen auszuschließen, 
wurde der mögliche Einsatz eines biologisch abbaubaren Kunststoffes untersucht 
(Kapitel 3 ).    Zusammenfassung

    In Kapitel 1  wurden die Auswirkungen von Nitrat auf Leistungs- und 
Gesundheitsparameter von Europäischen Wolfsbarschen ( Dicentrarchus labrax ) 
untersucht. Die Wolfsbarsche dienten dabei als eine Aquakultur-relevante, marine Modelfischart, die in KLA produziert wird. In 12 klein-skalierten, experimentellen KLA wurden die Wolfsbarsche in einem triplikaten Versuchsansatz für 10 Wochen vier unterschiedlichen Nitratkonzentratio nen zwischen 0 und 500 mg L
-1  ausgesetzt. Am 
Ende des Versuches waren Endgewicht, Endlänge, Konditionsfaktor, Futterverwertung 
und der spleen-somatic Index durch die getesteten Nitratkonzentrationen 
weitestgehend unbeeinflusst. Des Weit eren waren spezifische Wachstumsraten und 
Mortalität ebenfalls nicht signifikant unterschiedlich zwi schen den Versuchsgruppen. 
Jedoch war bei hohen Nitratk onzentrationen ein Trend zu geringeren spezifischen 
Wachstumsraten und steigender Mortalität zu erkennen. Die Ergebnisse in Kapitel 1  
zeigen eine signifikant negative K orrelation von hepato-somatic Index und 
Futteraufnahme in Zusamme nhang mit steigenden Nitratkonzentrationen.  
In dieser Studie konnte ein negativer Effe kt von Nitrat für wenige der untersuchten 
Parameter dokumentiert werden. Somit kann die Empfindlichkeit von Wolfsbarschen 
gegenüber Nitrat, im Vergleich zu anderen Fischarten, als gering eingeschätzt werden. 
Dennoch kann im Fall von empfindli cheren Entwicklungsstadi en oder anderen 
Fischspezies, eine Nitrat Entfernung durch Deni trifikationsreaktoren unabdingbar sein.  
In Kapitel 2  wurde die Nitrat Entfernung durch den SID-Reaktor in einer marinen KLA 
untersucht. Die Effekte von unterschied lichen hydraulischen Retentionszeiten 
(eng.: hydraulic retention time; HRT), Rü ckspül-Intervallen (eng.: backflushing 
intervals; BFI) und Ko hlenstoff- zu Stickstoffverhäl tnissen (C/N V erhältnis) wurden in 
einem konsekutiven experimentellen Ansatz im Hinblick auf Wasserqualität und Denitrifikationsleistung untersucht. Während der ersten Testserie wurden drei 
unterschiedliche HRTs geprüft. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass eine HRT von 
2 Stunden in höchster absoluter Denitrifikationsrate (497 g d
-1 m³ Aufwuchskörper), 
aber in geringer relativer De nitrifikationseffizienz von 64% resultierte. Eine HRT von 
6 Stunden hatte hingegen die höchste relativ e Denitrifikationseffizienz von 81%, aber 
eine niedrigere absolute Denitrifikationsrate (253 g d-1 m³ Aufwuchskörper) zur Folge. 
Während der zweiten Test serie wurden vier unt erschiedliche BFIs un tersucht. Es war 
ersichtlich, dass ein BFI alle 10 Minuten in ei ner geringen Denitrifikationseffizienz von 
29% resultierte, wobei ein BFI alle 90 Mi nuten in einem gestiegenen Wartungsaufwand 
resultierte. Insgesamt zeigten BFIs alle 30 bis 60 Minuten die besten Ergebnisse. 
Während der dritten Testserie wurden sieb en C/N Verhältnisse getestet, wobei 
Methanol als Kohlenstoffquelle genutzt w urde. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass ein C/N  Zusammenfassung   
_____________________________________________________________________ 
- 121 - 
    Verhältnis von 2.3 ausreichend war, um eine  optimale Denitrifikationsleistung zu 
erzielen. Eine Über- und Unterdosierung führte hingeg en zu einer Verschlechterung 
der Wasserqualität. 
In Kapitel 3  wurde untersucht, ob Methanol als flüssige  Kohlenstoffquelle durch einen 
biologisch abbaubaren Kunststoff aus Poly hydroxyalkanoat (PHA) ersetzt werden 
kann. Das genutzte PHA Granulat fungierte dabei gleichzeitig als Aufwuchskörper und 
feste Kohlenstoffquelle. Der Versuch wurde mit drei Süßwasser-KLA (1 m³), besetzt mit 
Zandern ( Sander lucioperca ), durchgeführt. Die erste KLA fungierte als Kontrolle und 
wurde ohne ein Denitrifikationssystem betr ieben. Die zweite KLA wurde mit einem 
Methanol betriebenen SID-Reaktor ausgestattet. An die dritte KLA wurde ein PHA 
betriebener SID-Reaktor angeschl ossen. Während des Versuches wurden 
Wasserqualitätsparameter von allen drei  KLA dokumentiert und verglichen. Des 
Weiteren wurde die Denitrifikationsleistung der zwei SID-Reaktoren verglichen. Wenn PHA als Kohlenstoffquelle genutz t wurde, waren Werte für Trübung, 
Gesamtammonium, Nitrit und für gesamt orga nischen Kohlenstoff geringer. Außerdem 
hatte der Einsatz von beiden SID-Reaktore n im Vergleich zur Kontrolle einen Anstieg 
der Alkalinität und des pH-Wertes zur Fo lge, sodass eine 50%ige Einsparung von 
Alkalinitätssupplementen möglich war. Beim Gebrauch von PHA als Kohlenstoffquelle 
wurde eine relative Denitrifikationseffizien z von 40% Nitratentfernung erzielt. Beim 
Einsatz von Methanol als Kohlenstoffquelle w urde eine relative Denitrifikationseffizienz 
von 98% Nitratentfernung erzielt. Im Hinblic k auf die absolute Denitrifikationsrate 
wurden jedoch keine signifikanten U nterschiede zwischen dem PHA und dem 
Methanol betriebenen SID-Reaktor festgestel lt. Grundsätzlich zeigen die Ergebnisse 
aus Kapitel 3 , dass das Funktionsprinzip des SID- Reaktors, der üb licherweise mit 
einer flüssigen Kohlenstoffquelle betreiben wird, auch für den Einsa tz mit einer festen 
Kohlenstoffquelle geeignet ist.  
Zusammenfassend zeigt diese  Arbeit, dass der Europäische  Wolfsbarsch eine eher 
Nitrat unempfindliche Spezies ist. Bei de r Produktion von emp findlicheren Fischarten 
ist der Einsatz eines SID-Reaktors als an gemessen zu beurteilen. Der Reaktor ist 
sicher und leicht zu bedienen , wobei eine effiziente Nitra t Elimination erzielt werden 
kann. Des Weiteren konnte die Denitrif ikationsleistung durch die Ergebnisse dieser 
Arbeit und durch technische Anpassungen verbessert werden. Wenn die Ergebnisse 
dieser Arbeit berücksichtigt werden, kann  der allgemeine Wartungsaufwand des 
SID-Reaktors zusätzlich reduziert werden. Um  den Einsatz des SID-Reaktors auf den 
letzten Stand der Forschung  zu bringen, wurde ein biol ogisch abbaubarer Kunststoff 
als geeignete Kohlenstoffquelle und als Au fwuchskörper eingesetzt. Auch wenn die  Zusammenfassung   
_____________________________________________________________________ 
- 122 - 
    Denitrifikationseffizienz beim PHA im Vergleich zum Methanol betriebenen 
SID-Reaktor geringer war, zeigte der Ei nsatz von PHA erhebliche  Vorteile, die als 
richtungsweisend für die Zu kunft zu bewerten sind.

    APPENDIX - METHODOLOGY OF 
WATER  ANALYTICS  
1 Spectrophotometrically measurements 
Determination of the nitrog en compounds ammonia nitrog en, nitrite nitrogen, and 
nitrate nitrogen were performed spectrophot ometrically using the DR 2800 photometer 
(Hach-Lange GmbH, Berlin, Germany) 
1.1 Ammonium nitrogen 
Ammonia nitrogen (NH 3-N) was analysed according to the powder pillow procedure by 
(Hach Company, 2015a) based on the Salicylate Method. During the reaction ammonia 
compounds form, combined with chlorine, mon ochloramine. Monochloramine in turn 
reacts with salicylate and forms 5-aminosalicylat, which is oxidized with the help of sodium nitroprusside catalyst and forms a blue-coloured compound. The blue colour 
results in combination with the yellow co lour from the excess reagent in a final 
green-coloured solution. The spectrophot ometrically measurement takes place at a 
wavelength of 655 nm. 
1.2 Nitrite nitrogen 
Nitrite nitrogen (NO 2--N) was analysed according to th e powder pillow procedure by 
(Hach Company, 2015b) based  on the USEPA Diazotization Method. During the 
reaction nitrite reacts with sulfanilic acid and forms an intermediat e diazonium salt. This 
salt reacts with chromotropic acid resulting in  a pink coloured complex, proportional to 
the amount of nitrite present in the water  sample. The spectrophotometrically 
measurement takes place at a wavelength of 520 nm.  
1.3 Nitrate nitrogen  
Nitrate nitrogen (NO 3--N) was analysed according to the powder pillow procedure by 
(Hach Company, 2015c) ba sed on the Cadmium Reduction Method. During the 
reaction cadmium metal re duces nitrate in the water sample to nitrite. The nitrite reacts 
with sulfanilic acid in an aci dic medium and forms an inter mediate diazonium salt. This 
salt reacts with gentisic acid resulting in an amber coloured complex. The spectrophotometrically measurement takes place at a wavelength of 400 nm.   Appendix

    2 Determination of carbon and nitrogen compounds  
A TOC-Analyser equipped with an auto sampler (TOC-LCPH/CPN PC-Controlled 
Model, Shimadzu Deutschland GmbH, Du isburg, Germany) was used to determine 
carbon and nitrogen containing compounds in water samples. With the TOC-Analyser 
following carbon compounds can be determin ed: total carbon (TC), inorganic carbon 
(IC), total organic carbon (TOC), dissolve d carbon (DC), dissolved inorganic carbon 
(DIC), dissolved organic carbon  (DOC), purgeable organi c carbon (POC), and non-
purgeable organic carbon (NPOC). Furthe rmore nitrogenous compounds can be 
determined in form of total nitrogen (TN). The TOC-Analyser applies the combustion 
catalytic oxidation method at 720°C with a detection range of 4 μg L-1 to 30,000 mg L-1. 
The catalytic oxidation method ensures the ef ficient oxidation of not only easily 
decomposable, low-molecular-weight organic compounds, but also hard to decompose 
insoluble and macromolecular organic compounds.  
The following section (2.1 PRINZIPLES OF  ANALYSIS) is quoted from the 
TOC-Analyser XVHU¶VPDQXDO6KLPDG]X&RUSRUDWLRQ  
2.1 Principles of analysis 
Two types of carbon are present in water: organic carbon and inorganic carbon. 
Organic carbon (TOC) bonds with hydrogen or oxygen to form organic compounds. 
Inorganic carbon (IC or TIC) is the structural basis for inorganic compounds such as gas carbonates and carbonate ions. Collectiv ely the two forms of carbon are referred to 
as total carbon (TC) and the relation ship between them is expressed TOC=TC-IC. 
Nitrogen is also present in water in two type s: organic and inorganic. The sum of these 
is referred to as total nitrogen (TN). The prin ciples underlying TC and TN analysis are 
explained in the following sections. 
2.1.1 Principles of total carbon analysis 
Sample is introduced into the total carbon (TC) combustion tube, which is filled with an 
oxidation catalyst and heated to 680°C. The sa mple is burned in the combustion tube 
and, as a result, the TC components in the sa mple are converted to carbon dioxide. 
Carrier gas, which flows at a rate of 150 mL  min-1 to the combus tion tube, carries the 
sample combustion products from the combustion tu be to an electronic dehumidifier, 
where the gas is cooled and dehydrated. The gas then carries the sample combustion 
products through a halogen scrubber to remove chlorine and other halogens. Finally, 
the carrier gas delivers the sample combustion pr oducts to the cell of a non-dispersive 
infrared (NDIR) gas analyser, where the carbon dioxide is detected. The NDIR outputs  Appendix

    an analogue detection signal that form s a peak; the peak area is measured by the 
TOC-Control L software. 
The peak area is proportional to the TC concentration of the sample. A calibration 
curve equation that mathematically expresses th e relationship between peak area and 
TC concentration can be generated by an alysing various concentrations of a TC 
standard solution. The TC concen tration in a sample can be determined by analysing 
the sample to obtain the peak area and th en using the peak area in the calibration 
curve equation. 
2.1.2 Principles of inorganic carbon analysis 
Two methods for measuring inorganic carbon (IC) using the TOC-L are available: 
analysis within the injection syringe and analys is using the optional IC reactor. In both 
methods, the measured IC consists of ca rbon derived from carbonates, hydrogen 
carbonates and dissolved carbon dioxide. 
Defining IC 
The IC measured by TOC analysis consists of the carbon contained in carbonates and 
in carbon dioxide dissolved in water. By acidifying the sample with a small amount of hydrochloric acid to obtain a pH less than  3, all carbonates are converted to carbon 
dioxide (CO
2) by the following reactions: 
Me 2CO 3 + 2HCl Æ CO 2 + 2MeCl + H 2O  
MeHCO 3 + HCl Æ CO 2 + MeCl + H 2O 
Carbon dioxide and dissolved carbon dioxide in  the sample are volatiliz ed by bubbling 
(sparging) air or nitrogen gas that does not contain carbon dioxide through the sample. 
2.1.3 Analysis using the IC reaction vessel (H type instrument) 
The TOC-L IC reactor kit is used to sparge th e IC reaction solution (acidified reaction 
liquid) with carrier gas. Sample is  injected into the IC reaction  vessel and the IC in the 
sample is converted to carbon dioxide, whi ch is volatilized by the sparging process and 
detected by the NDIR. 
2.1.4 Analysis within the syringe (N type instrument) 
The sample is acidified to pH 3 or lower in the syringe, using hydrochloric acid. The sample is sparged with carrier gas and the IC in the sample is converted to carbon 
dioxide and detected by the NDIR.  Appendix  
_____________________________________________________________________ 
- 128 - 
    2.1.5 Principles of Non-Purgable Organic Carbon analysis 
After acidifying the sample to pH 2 to 3, sparge gas is bubbled through the sample to 
eliminate the IC component. The remaining TC  is measured to determine total organic 
carbon, and the result is generally referred to  as TOC. However, in the TOC-L, this 
analysis value is referred to Non-Purgea ble Organic Carbon (NPOC) to distinguish it 
from the TOC value obtained by calculatin g the difference between TC and IC. NPOC 
stands for non-purgeable organic carbon and re fers to organic carbon that is present in 
a sample in a non-volatile form. 
NPOC and TOC (obtained by IC elimination)  described in the TOC-related standard 
methods and referred to in water qualit y-related test methods (JIS, ASTM, EPA, EN) 
are identical. Purgeable organic substances in  the sample can be lost during the 
sparging process. Consequently, when the sample contains purgeable organic substances, TOC should not be measured by  the NPOC method. If the dissolved 
purgeable organic component in the water sample is large, the amount volatilized 
during sparging is relatively small. Generally, the amount of purgeable organic 
substances in natural environmental, public and purified water is  small; as a result, 
NPOC can be referred to as TOC. 
2.1.6 Principles of Purgeable Organic Carbon  
Purgeable Organic Carbon (P OC) analysis is used to  measure the volatilized 
component of TOC, which is produced during the NPOC sample sparging process. As 
a result, NPOC+POC is equivalent to TOC.  POC analysis is performed as follows. 
Sparge gas containing the volatilized CO 2 and POC components of the sample is 
carried to the lithium hydroxide-filled CO 2 absorber to eliminate the CO 2 that was 
converted from the IC in the sample. The gas, which now contains only the POC 
component of the sample, then passes through the combustion tube to be oxidized. 
The POC component is convertedto CO 2 during oxidation and the CO 2 is detected by 
the NDIR. Data processing is conducted in the same manner as for TC. 
POC is not precisely defined. Factors that dete rmine whether or not, or to what degree, 
a volatile organic carbon component is volatilized  during sparging include the type of 
organic compound, the gas/liquid contact with the sparge gas, and the ambient 
temperature during sparging. The target of POC analysis is the organic component present in the aqueous phase. As a result , organic compounds that are highly soluble 
in water (such as methanol or ethanol) and no t easily volatilized by sparging produce 
almost no peaks in POC analysis.  Appendix  
_____________________________________________________________________ 
- 129 - 
    Organic compounds with low solubility in water (such as methylene chloride or 
chloroform) produce sharp peaks in POC analysis. Over a long period of time, compounds such as acetone and methyl isob utyl ketone generate extremely broad, 
tailing peaks with no specific end time. 
The lithium hydroxide-filled CO
2 absorber eliminates the carbon dioxide that was 
generated along with the POC substances. Th erefore, POC components that are easily 
caught in the CO 2 absorber (such as esters) produce low values in POC analysis. POC 
results obtained using this technique are not absolute. The user should take all the 
above factors into consideration when measuring POC using this instrument. 
2.1.7 Principles of measuring Total Organic Carbon  
Total Organic Carbon (TOC) can be measured using the following 3 methods:  
- TC-IC Method - NPOC Method  
- POC+NPOC Method  
 TC-IC Method 
In the TC-IC method, TOC is measured as the difference between the TC and IC 
analysis values. The TC-IC method is not recommended for samples that contain more IC than TOC (samples where TC consists almo st entirely of IC);  the NPOC method is 
recommended for such samples. The TOC value determined using the TC-IC method includes errors associated with  each of the individual TC and IC measurements, and 
can therefore result in a large error in the TOC value. 
Because detection accuracy decreases with increasing IC concentration, the NPOC 
method is also recommended for samples con taining IC concentrations exceeding 
10ppm for TOC/TN catalyst and 5pp m for high sensitivity catalyst. 
NPOC Method 
The NPOC method is the most widely use d TOC analysis method. The NPOC method 
is not recommended for samples that foam during sparging. Samples that become foamy during sparging tend to form bubbles that flow out of the syringe, which removes 
the concentrated TOC sample components and leaves a small amount of TOC in the syringe. The TC-IC method is recommend in this situation. 
Moreover, since TOC cannot be correctly measured in samples that coagulate or 
precipitate when acidified, use the TC-IC method.  Appendix  
_____________________________________________________________________ 
- 130 - 
    POC+NPOC Method 
The POC+NPOC method should be used when the amount of POC present in the 
sample cannot be disregarded. 
2.1.8 Principles of measuring Total Nitrogen 
When a sample is introduced into the combus tion tube (furnace temperature 720°C), 
the Total Nitrogen (TN) in the sample decomposes to nitrogen monoxide. Nitrogen gas does not become nitrogen mono xide under these circums tances. The carrier gas, 
which contains the nitrogen monoxide, is cooled and dehumidified by the electronic 
dehumidifier. The gas then enters a chemiluminescence gas analyser, where the 
nitrogen monoxide is detected. The det ection signal from the chemiluminescence gas 
analyser generates a peak and the TN concentration in the sample can then be measured.   Appendix

    3 Other water chemical parameters  
3.1 Oxygen 
For dissolved oxygen measurement a ha nd-held oxygen meter was used (Handy 
Polaris, OxyGuard International A/S, Farum, Denmark). The probe is of the Mackareth 
cell type and consists of a two-electrode elect rochemical cell with a thin gas-permeable 
membrane separating the electrodes and the electrolyte solution from the analyzed media. During measurement oxygen diffuses through the membrane. The 
electrochemical reduction of oxygen generates a potential of the working electrode. 
The sensor current is proportional to the oxygen concentration in the water and is 
processed by the hand-held unit to an output value. 
3.2 Oxidation-Reduction Potential 
For the measurement of oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) a hand-held ORP meter 
was used (GMH 5550, GHM Messtechnik GmbH , Regenstauf, Germany). The ORP 
indicates that the sample being measured has an oxidizing or reducing effect relative to 
the hydrogen normal electrode. The measurement is carried out with the widespread 
silver / silver chloride electrodes, a reference system with 3 molar potassium chloride 
solution. 
3.3 Salinity 
Practical salinity was measured by a refracto meter (Refractometer HI 96822, HANNA 
Instruments, Woonsocket, USA). The salinity is  determined by mea suring the refractive 
index of seawater. The refractive index is an optical property of  a substance and the 
number of particles dissolved therein. The refr active index is defined as the ratio of the 
speed of light in empty space to the speed of  light in the substance. In HI 96822, the 
light from an LED passes through a prism that is in contact with the sample. An image 
sensor determines the critical angle at which the light no longer breaks through the 
sample. The refractometer converts the refracti ve index of the sample into one of the 
common salinity units. 
3.4 pH 
The pH was measured by a hand-held pH meter (SenTix®41, WTW pH 3310, Xylem 
Analytics Germany Sales GmbH & Co.KG, We ilheim, Germany). The determination of 
the pH was done by the potentiometric  method. This method uses the electrical 
potential of pH-sensitive electrodes (hy drogen-, metal- and glass- electrodes) as a  Appendix  
_____________________________________________________________________ 
- 132 - 
    measurement signal. The sensor current is processed by the hand-held unit to an 
output value. 
3.5 Acid Neutralizing Capacity 
The acid neutralising capacity (ANC) of th e water was determined by the method of 
titration according to (Radtke et al., 1998).  ANC is defined as the equivalent of all 
bases or base producing substances in the water sample that can be titrated by a 
strong acid to equivalence point (pH 4.3 ). For titration a colour indicator (methyl 
orange) was added to 100 mL of a w ater sample. By adding 0.1 molar hydrochloric 
acid the colour of the liquid changes from yell ow to orange/red at the point when a 
pH-value of 4.3 is reached. 
3.6 Turbidity  
Water turbidity was measured with the help of a turbidity meter (Turbidity Meter, PCE-TUM 20). The method is used to determine the concentration of suspended 
particles in a grab sample by measuring rectangular emitted light of 850 nm 
wavelength. A photodiode that captures the lig ht produces an electronic signal which is 
converted to a specific turbidity value. Th e turbidity meter works in accordance to ISO 
7027 and gives the turbidity of the w ater sample as a value expressed in nephelometric 
turbidity units (NTU). The meter measures in a range from 0 to 1000 NTU.
