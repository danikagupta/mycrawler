abstract
Reactive Red 120 (RR 120) dye is widely used for textile dyeing in many countries. Most of the dye 
can cause skin reactions such as allergy, dermatitis and skin irritation, and are therefore considered 
as hazardous materials and toxic compounds for humans. Harvested cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  
were locally obtained from an Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology. To pro-vide an optimum condition for RR 120 removal by the response surface methodology, input factors 
contained the initial concentration of RR 120 5–50 mg L
–1, dose of S. cerevisiae 3–10 g L–1, pH 
3–10 and contact time 10–180 min. After completing each run, the suspensions were centrifuged at 
10,000 rpm for 7 min. Finally, the absorbance of sample was read using UV-visible spectrophotometer 
at the wavelength of 511 nm. Based on the results, the obtained values from the adsorption of RR 120 
were variables ranging from 23 to 96. The highest adsorption rate of RR 120 (99.97%) was obtained at RR 120 concentration of 16.25 mg L
–1, yeast dose of 8.25 g L–1, pH 4.75 and contact time of 52.5 min. 
The dye removal efficiency was better in acidic pH. The Langmuir model was better described in 
the equilibrium biosorption data. The pseudo-second-order model was the suitable model to fit the 
experimental data.

1. Introduction
Environmental cleanup is mainly focused on the removal 
of contaminants from polluted industrial wastewater, which 
destroys the ecosystem. In particular, the textile industry 
includes many types of processing. Textile dyes can be considered as the emergent contaminants in water and can contribute the mutagenicity of representative environmen-tal samples [1]. In the world, there are 10,000 types of dye-stuff and about 7 × 10
5 tons of these are created annually 
[2]. Generally, synthetic dyes include anionic (direct, acid and reactive dyes), cationic (basic) and non-ionic (disperse) types. 20%–30% of commercial dyes were used to include anionic types (direct, acid and reactive). Reactive dyes are 419 A. Navaei et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 171 (2019) 418–427
formed by the combination of azo-based chromophores 
with various types of reactive groups e.g., vinyl sulfone, 
chlorotriazine, trichloropyrimidine and difluoro chloropy-
rimidine. Reactive dye is a dye that can react directly with 
the fabric, which means that a chemical reaction transpires between the dyes and the molecules of the fabric, effec-
tively making the dyes as part of the fabric [3]. Reactive 
Red 120 (RR 120) and Reactive Blue Bezaktiv 150 (RBB 
150) are one of the oldest synthetic dyes that are frequently 
employed in many industrial sectors especially in dyeing clothes. However, dyeing processes based on the use of 
reactive dyes generate a massive amount of unfixed dyes 
and the wastewater as by-product of this process may inter -
fere with the ecosystem through the effluent discharges. Surveys show that nearly 20% of total global production is lost during the dyeing process and disposed in waste-
water [3]. In addition, these can cause a serious hazard to 
aquatic ecosystems. Treatment of reactive dyes is partially 
hard because they are not removed by conventional treat-
ment systems [4]. Techniques have been proposed to treat effluent contaminated with dyes, such as flocculation, ozo -
nation and photodegradation. However, the high costs of 
these treatments underscore the need for alternative meth-
ods. Biological treatment involving dye-degrading micro-organisms has been studied and proposed as an alternative [5–7]. Still, degradation often requires a long time before 
achieving satisfactory results and can sometimes result in 
by-products that are even more toxic than the dye itself [8]. 
The effluent treatment itself is not enough to confirm the effectiveness of the techniques; therefore, post-treatment toxicity evaluation is recommended [9,10]. The removal 
of dyes by microorganisms (yeast, bacteria and/or fungi) 
depends on the chemical and physical properties of both 
of them. The yeasts have many benefits compared to fila-mentous fungi and bacteria. Yeasts can acceptably remove reactive dyes because of their unicellular nature and high 
growth rate. The growth of yeast cells were usually carried 
out into inexpensive culture media. The growth media of 
yeasts can provide an easily available source of biomass. These media are suitable for bioremediation of wastes at lower pH values. Yeasts adapt highly in different extreme 
conditions of pH, temperature and availability of nutrient, 
and therefore can grow high in concentrations of pollutant. 
In this regard, Saccharomyces cerevisiae can metabolize and biosorb dye compounds [11–13]. S. cerevisiae, popularly 
called Baker’s yeast, is present in different technological 
activities and produces high yields of biomass for use on 
an industrial scale. Moreover, this microorganism is inex-
pensive, safe, easily grown and readily available [7]. These 
microorganisms can be produced in large quantities and used as a by-product in some industries. S. cerevisiae can 
adsorb and or degrade azo dyes into aromatic amines with 
side groups (–SO
3, –OH, –COOH, –Cl) [14]. McMullan et al. 
[14] reviewed the main mechanisms for dyestuffs removal 
by diverse categories of microorganisms from bacterial and 
fungal domains. Vatandoostarani et al. [15] and Jadhav et al. [11] performed similar studies. In the current study, the removal of RR 120 by the S. cerevisiae yeast was considered 
due to advantages such as safety, low cost, simplicity, wide-
spread distribution, non-pathogenic, rapid growth of cells 
and easy cultivation. The multivariate statistical methods have to be employed for optimizing the influential factors. Response surface methodology (RSM) is a combination of statistical and mathematical methods that uses the polyno-
mial equation to fit the experimental data [16]. This model 
is especially practical when some responses are affected by 
different input variables. It will help the researchers to use a novel method with the minimum number of experiments [17,18]. The technique of experimental design is a useful 
tool that uses statistical models to optimize the interaction 
between different parameters. Using the RSM, we can study 
the interaction between two or more parameters [19].
The aim of this work was designed to optimize the bio-
sorption of RR 120 from aqueous solutions by S. cerevisiae  
using RSM and to evaluate adsorption capacity with differ -
ent kinetic and isotherms models.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
All chemicals used in the experiments were reagent 
grade. All solutions were prepared with distilled water. The 
anionic dye, RR 120 was provided by Sigma-Aldrich chem-icals (St. Louis, MO, USA). S. cerevisiae (PTCC 5052) was 
bought from Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology. For preparing S. cerevisiae at the concentration of 5 g L
–1, 5 g of yeast was added into 1,000 mL of toxic sub-
stance solution. All chemicals applied in the experiments were of reagent grade. All solutions were prepared with distilled water. RR 120 was provide from Sigma-Aldrich company (USA). The chemical structure and some proper -
ties of the RR 120 dye are offered in Fig. 1 and Table 1.
2.2. Treatment procedure
In this study, 100 mL of the reaction mixture was 
provided at different experimental parameters such as the contact time 10–180 min, initial RR 120 concentra-tion 5–50 mg L
–1, yeast dose 3–10 g L–1, and pH 3–10. All 
experiments were performed in a series of 250 mL conical flasks, and agitated at the fixed speed of 120 rpm and room temperature 28°C ± 2°C. Kinetic and isotherm models of adsorption was obtained using various factors, including RR 120 10–50 mg L
–1, yeast 10 g L–1, contact time 95 min, and 
pH 6.5.

2.3. Kinetic and Equilibrium Study
The adsorption kinetics were carried out using param-
eters such as the RR 120 concentration of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 
50 mg L–1, the yeast of 10 g L–1, with the pH of 6.5 and con-
tact time of 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 90, 120 and 240 min. Further, 
a study of adsorption isotherm was conducted with exper -
imental factors, that is, the RR 120 concentration of 10, 20, 
30, 40 and 50 mg L–1, the yeast of 10 g L–1, with the pH of 6.5, 
and contact time of 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 90, 120 and 240 min. The experiments were conducted at the constant agitation 
speed of 160 rpm and room temperature.
2.4. Analytical methods
After completing the process of biosorption, the reac-
tion solutions were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 7 min to remove the medium. Finally, the value of absorbance was measured by UV-visible spectrophotometer, model T80+ (PG instrument Ltd., Leicester, UK), at the wavelength of 560 nm [20], and the amount of RR 120 in the samples was obtained based on the standard curve. To provide the stan-dard curve, all solutions were made using four standards over the RR 120 range of 5–20 mg L
–1 which resulted in the 
standard curve with the linear correlation coefficient (R2) of 
0.999. The removal efficiency (R , %) of RR 120 was calculated 
using the equations as follows:
RCC
C%() =−()

× 0
0100  (1)
where C0 is the initial concentration of RR 120 mg L–1, C is 
the concentration of RR 120 in solution after removal (mg L–1).
2.5. Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 
16.0. Statistical analysis of the biosorption data was done via one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s 
honestly significant difference.
2.6. Experimental design and statistical analysis
The design of the experiment was carried out using 
RSM. Conventional optimization approach, one-variable-at-
a-time, which is applied for observing the effect of experi-mental variables is time-consuming and expensive. Hence, the multivariate statistical methods have to be employed for optimizing the influential factors. RSM is a combination of statistical and mathematical methods that uses the polyno-mial equation to fit the experimental data. This model is espe-cially practical when some responses are affected by differ -
ent input variables. It will help the researchers to use a novel method with the minimum number of experiments [17,21].
As shown in Table 2, four parameters were selected for 
this study, including the initial RR 120 concentration (mg L
–1), 
contact time (min), S. cerevisiae dose (g L–1) and pH which 
was at the three levels of high (+1), low (–1) and medium (0), respectively. Moreover, assisting points coded +a and –a were considered for model validation based on the models.
In this study, 30 runs were performed using RSM 
with 16 real points, 8 pivot points and 6 central focal point. The quadratic model for the variables is presented below:

where Y, β0, βi, βii, βij and xi/xj are the predicted response, 
the constant coefficient, regression coefficients for linear effects, quadratic coefficients, interaction coefficients and the coded values of the parameters, respectively. The fit of the models was evaluated by determining the coefficients (R
2) and adjusted R2 (R2

3. Results and discussion
The Fourier-transform infrared analysis for S. cerevi-
siae before and after the sorption of dye is shown in Fig. 2. As seen in Fig. 2, the peaks at 3,432.45 and 334 cm
–1 were 
attributed to stretching vibrations of –OH and C–H groups in the structure of S. cerevisiae, respectively.
The peak of N–H groups shifted from 3,322.45 to 
3,347.02 cm
–1 after adsorption, indicating that the dye could 
reinforce the stretching vibration of hydrogen bonds in proteins.
The S. cerevisiae biomass spectrum showed two intense 
peaks in the 1,656.42 and 1,547.19 cm
−1 regions, which Table 1

represent the binding of the amide group R–NH–C–O–CH3. 
The band at 1,453 cm−1 is the stretching of the –C–NH bond, 
probably by an amine group belonging to a chitin of the yeast 
cell wall. The peak in the 1,239 cm−1 region shows the vibration 
of the –C=O bond, which is another linking group in the chitin structure. The band at 1,070 cm
−1 had high intensity, indicat-
ing the presence of the –C–O bond. This chemical group is present in the sugars of the yeast cell wall. The 656 cm
−1 region 
demonstrated reasonable intensity, indicating the presence of 
the –C–N–C group found in proteins on the yeast cell wall [7].In this study, the impact of different factors, including 
RR 120 concentration, S. cerevisiae concentration, reaction 
time and pH was investigated on the removal of RR 120. 
The summary of the results of the study are showed in 
Table 3.
Table 3 shows the regression results of quadratic model 
for the removal of RR 120. Fig. 3 illustrates the relation 
between the predicted and actual removal of RR 120.
The quadratic model is explained in Eq. (2) in terms of 
coded variables of the removal of RR 120

Regarding Eq. (2), each model has a variable part and 
a fixed part RR 120 can be seen in the equation, the rate 
of biosorption has been 90.30% that is impacted by vari-ous parameters.The main effect of A, B, C and D have the 
coefficients of –6, +20.22, –16 and +8.34, respectively.
The main effect is related to the code of B , which has 
been shown with the coefficient of +20.22. The maximum interaction impact belongs to the BC with the coefficient of 16.76, and the highest square effects of the variables 
belong to the B
2 with the coefficient of +6.89.
Based on the results of Table 3, the highest and lowest 
adsorption of RR 120 was 99.97% and 15.23%, respectively. 
Findings (Fig. 3) showed that the observed values of the 
adsorption of RR 120 were in the range of 15.23%–99.97%, 
which was not different from the values predicted by the model RSM. The results of this research using Eq. (2) deter -
mined that the process of treatment was able to adsorb 
90.30% of RR 120 from aquatic solutions. This process 
underwent the main, interaction and square effects. Each of 
these effects has coefficients with negative or positive signs 
that reflect negative or positive effects are on adsorption 
rate. Table 4 displays ANOVA of the quadratic model for the adsorption efficiency of RR 120. The best model to fit 
the experimental data with independent variables was the 
quadratic model. ANOVA was used to determine the sig-
nificance of the model (P -values < 0.05). Overall, the results 
displays that this process was significance (P -values < 0.05). 
Findings indicated in Table 4 revealed that R
2, and justified 
R2 were 0.93 and 0.86, respectively.
3.1. Effect of independent parameters on RR 120 adsorption
The effect of contact time and initial dye concentration 
on RR 120 removal are indicated in Fig. 4. The results of Fig. 4

adsorption of RR 120 and its initial concentration. From the 
results, the adsorption initially increases due to the increase in the driving force of the concentration gradient [2,23] and then gradually decreases along with the elevation of the RR 
120 concentration. This can be attributed to the fact that the 
biosorption capacity is influenced by the increase in the con-
centration of RR 120 which reduces the biosorption capacity owing to the saturating sorption sites of the cell wall of yeast [24]. Based on Fig. 4, there is a direct correlation between the 
adsorption rate of RR 120 and the contact time. The change 
in the adsorption rate can be due to the reason that initially 
all the adsorbent sites are vacant and solute concentration gradient is very high. Later, the lower adsorption rate is due to a decrease in the number of vacant sites of adsorbent and dye concentrations. The decreased adsorption rate, particu-larly, towards the end of contact time, indicates the possible monolayer formation of RR 120 on the adsorbent surface [25,26]. This may be attributed to the lack of available active 
sites required for further uptake after attaining the equilib-
rium. Fig. 4 exhibits the effect of pH and adsorbent dosage 
on RR 120 removal. Results (Fig. 5) display an increase in the uptake percentage of RR 120 with the increase in the concentration of S. cerevisiae. The main variable describing 
this performance is that at initial adsorbent concentration, 
adsorption sites remain unsaturated during the adsorption 
reaction, whereas the number of sites available for adsorp-tion increases by enhancing the adsorbent concentration due to the augmentation of available surface area. The

presence of relatively higher concentration of adsorbent in 
the solution leading to diminished distances between the adsorbent particles, thus making many binding sites unoc-cupied [27,28]. In addition, the inter-particles interactions like accumulation, overcrowding and overlapping create at high adsorbent concentrations. This can lead to decrease in available total surface area [29]. The results of this study (Fig. 5) show that with the increase in the solution pH from 4.75 to 8.25, the adsorption of RR 120 decreases. The solution pH can alter the ionization degree and the surface charge of materials [30]. The cell wall of yeast contains the various compositions such as polysaccharides (i.e., chitin and chi-tosan), proteins, lipids and melanin as well as different func-tional groups (such as, amino, carboxyl, thiol and phosphate groups) [31]. Functional groups play an important role in adsorbing the dye molecules. Compared with other groups, amine groups are more active in adsorbing contaminants due to creating positive charges on yeast. Carboxyl and phosphonate groups and phosphonate, on the other hand, bring negative charges on the yeast. The pH of solution can change the ionic form of the dye and the surface electrical charge of yeast. At lower pH values, yeast biomass is posi-tively charged leading to the protonation of amine groups, which are desirable to the adsorption of the negative charged dye [32,33]. On the other hand, the sulfonate group (–SO
3H) 
in the molecular structure of the RR 120 can be converted in aqueous medium into active negative sulfonate group (–SO
3–). 
Consequently, a strong electrostatic (columbic) attraction between positively charged protonated amino group of S. cerevisiae with negatively charged sulfonate group of RR120, 
thus increases dyes adsorption [34]. As shown from the find-
ings of Fig. 5, as the pH was reduced, the RR 120 biosorption 
on the cell wall of yeast enhanced. RR 120 is known as an acidic dye and is composed of six sulfonate, two hydroxyl and six secondary amino groups [27,35]. The pKa value of the sulfonate groups of the dye molecule is 2.1. At the work-ing experimental conditions, this functional group is easily separated and therefore, net negative charges are created in the dye molecules [35,36]. Thus, the positive sites of cell well such as protonated form of amino groups (i.e., –NH
3) can 
have a main role in the RR 120 biosorption using S. cerevi-siae. The binding sites increase by increasing pH, and hence the adsorption of RR 120 enhances [37,38]. The study of Drufovka et al. [39] confirmed that microorganisms could be having high removal efficiency at low pH. Aksu et al. [40] used S. cerevisiae to remove reactive dye where at a low pH, 
the removal efficiency of the reactive dye was significantly high.
3.2. Biosorption kinetics
The parameters of the kinetic model and regression cor -
relation coefficient are presented in Table 5. In this study, 
the effect of adsorbent dose on the adsorption capacity (mg g
–1) was studied and the value of adsorption capacity 
was calculated by the kinetic reaction models, that is, the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models [41,42].
The pseudo-first-order model is expressed as Eq. (2):
logl og.qq qktet e−() =−1
2303 (4)
where k1 (min–1), qe (mg g–1) and qt (mg g–1) are the pseudo- 
first-order kinetic constant, adsorbed RR 120 per mass of 
S. cerevisiae at equilibrium, and the amount of adsorbed RR 
120 per mass of the yeast at any time t (min), respectively.
The pseudo-second-order model is described as follows:

where k2 (g mg–1 min–1) is the rate constant of pseudo- second-
order sorption. From Table 5, the pseudo-second-order 
model for studied concentrations of RR 120 was found more suitable for describing kinetic data according to the cor -
relation coefficient (R
2 ≥ 0.98) and obtained statistical data 
compared with pseudo-first-order model [26]. This result in agreement with the dye removal by other adsorbents like modified rice stem [43], multi walled carbon nanotubes [44], canola [45], heat-treated rice husk [46] and modified azolla filicoloides [47].
3.3. Biosorption isotherms
The models of Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm were 
applied to explain the equilibrium data of biosorption.
The Langmuir isotherm equation is:
qqKC
KCemL e
Le=+1 (6)
where qe (mg g–1), qm (mg g–1), KL (L mg–1) and Ce (mg L–1) 
are expressed as the biosorption capacity at the equilibrium state, the maximum biosorption capacity, the Langmuir equi-
librium constant and the equilibrium concentration of RR 120, respectively [32].
The linear form of the Freundlich model is showed as 
follows:
qK CeF en=1
 (7)
where KF and n reflect Freundlich constants are describe as 
the biosorption capacity and biosorption intensity, respec-
tively [48].
Langmuir and Freundlich constants and correlation coef-
ficients are listed in Table 6. As seen in Table 6, the Langmuir 
isotherm exhibited the best-fit model (R2 = 0.98) for RR 120 
removal, compared to the Freundlich model (R2 = 0.43). 
Also, the maximum adsorption capacity of S. cerevisiae was obtained to be 23.48 mg g
–1 based on the Langmuir model. 
Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms describe the mecha-nism of monolayer biosorption with homogenous energy and the multilayer biosorption with heterogeneous energy, respectively [49,50].

4. Conclusion
In this paper, the biosorption of RR 120 was investigated 
by S. cerevisiae. The maximum adsorption rates have been 
observed at an acidic pH. The biosorption of RR 120 has a 
direct relationship with the dose of S. cerevisiae and reac-tion time, and an inverse relationship with pH and initial concentration of RR 120. The biosorption process of RR 120 
was indicated to be dependent on pH, initial dye concen-
tration and contact time. The removal efficiency of RR 120 
had an increasing rate from 52.5 to 137.5 min followed by equilibrium state. The dye removal efficiency was better in acidic pH. The Langmuir model better described the equi-librium biosorption data. The pseudo-second- order model 
was the best model to fit the experimental data. The results of this study confirmed that S. cerevisiae could be used as a low-cost adsorbent for adsorption of RR 120 from aque-ous environments. We can conclude that S. cerevisiae has the ability to remove dye with the lowest cost and a high efficiency.
