Abstract 
The removal of toxic heavy metal ions from waste water is of great importance from an environmental 
view point. Biosorption is an e ffective technology, using non-living biomass to remove heavy metals 
from aqueous solutions. In this paper, the biosorption of copper ions onto the dead biomass of Spirogyra, a green algae, was investigated in batch mode. The results indicated that the biomass of Spirogyra sp. is 
an efficient biosorbent for the removal of Copper ions from aqueous solutions and pH dependent. The 
maximum removal rate was achieved at a solution of pH of 8.5. 
Keywords: Biosorption, Kinetics, Spirogyra sp, waste water. 
Introduction 
Heavy metals are among the major concerns in waste water treatment. Heavy metals are often 
derived from heavy industry, such  as electroplating and battery factories. The treatment of this 
type of waste water involves high cost tec hniques such as ion exchange, evaporation, 
precipitation, membrane separation etc. However, these common techniques are too expensive to treat low levels of heavy metal in waste water (Banerjee, 2002). Therefore a low cost 
biosorption process using algae as an adsorbent has lately been introduced as an alternative 
(Volesky, 1990). 
Biosorption is a term that describes the removal of heavy metal, by the passive binding to non 
– living biomass from an aqueous solutions. Biosorption uses inexpensive dry biomass to
extract industrial effluents of toxic heavy metals. The biosorption is a process in which solids of natural origin are employed for binding h eavy metals. The biomass can be composed of 
algae, mosses, fungi, bacteria and various, plan t species. It is a promising alternative method to 
treat industrial effluents, mainly because of its low cost and high metal binding capacity. The algae can be collected and/or cultivated in many parts of the world, factor that has encouraged 
the development of new biosorbent materials using biomass. The toxic effects of copper on 
microorganisms are well documented and many report exists of copper uptake by microorganisms (Romera et al., 2008; Holan and Volesky 1994; Sheng et al., 2004). Copper, 
like the majority of heavy metals, is toxic but it has been widely used in metallurgical and tanning industries. Therefore, this work was developed with the objective of evaluated the 
copper biosorption process by means of the dead green algae biomass. The objective of the 
present study was investigate the use of green algae biomass as a biosorbent for the removal of copper ions from aqueous solutio n and also the effect of pH. 
Materials and methods 
Biosorbent – Algal biomass, Spirogyra was washed thoroughly in running tap water 4-5 times 
and distilled water to remove alkalinity. Later it was dried in a hot air oven at 60 °C for 24 
hours. The dried biomass was then ground well and passed through a 100-200 mesh sieve to obtain a powder form. Finally the contents were stored in a desiccator at room temperature to 
be used as a powdered biosorbent.  
Preparation of synthetic solution 
A stock solution of 1000 ppm copper solution was prepared by dissolving 2.51 g of 
CuSO
4.5H 2O in 1 L of deionized distilled water. Various concentrations of test solutions were 
prepared by appropriate dilution of the stock solution. The initial pH of each solution was then 
adjusted to the required value with different concentrations of HCl and NaOH solutions using 
pH meter.

Batch Biosorption studies 
Batch mode adsorption studies were carried out to investigate 
the effect of different parameters  such as contact time and pH 
on the rate of adsorption of copper by biomass. The amount of adsorbed metal ions per gram of dead algae was obtained 
using the following equation: 
 
q = [(C
i - C e) ൈܸ]/M 
 
where q is the metal uptake (mg/g), Ci is the initial metal 
concentration (mg/l), C e is the intial metal concentration 
(mg/l), V is the volume of metal solution and M is the mass of biosorbent used in the reaction mixture (Hashim and Chu, 
2004). 
 
Results and discussion 
Effect of pH 
Biosorption of heavy metals ions is depend on the pH of 
solution as it affects biosorbe nt surface charge, degree of 
ionization, and the species of biosorbent (Ahmady- Asbchin et 
al., 2008). The pH of the solution influence both metal 
bindings sites on the cell surf ace and the the chemistry of 
metal in solution (Dursun, 2006). In order to demonstrate the effect of pH on biosorption capacity, uptake of copper onto 
dead algae as a function of pH wa s studied in the pH ranges of 
4 to 8.5   
 
 
Conclusion 
The study indicated that the dried biomass of green algae 
Spirogyra could bw used as an efficient biosorbent maerial for 
the removal of copper ions from aqueous solutions. The dried 
algal biomass, was found to be very efficient in removing 
copper ions ( ൎ7 8 . 0 % ) from aqueous solution and the 
maximum removal rate was achieved at a solution of pH of 
8.5. It has been concluded that this adsorbent has a great 
potential for removing copper from aqueous solutions as an 
eco-friendly process.
