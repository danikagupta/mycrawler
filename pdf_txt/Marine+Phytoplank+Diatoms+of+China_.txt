Abstract
A quantitative study was undertaken on diatoms from cores (SA08-34) obtained from the southwestern continental slope of the South
China Sea (SCS). A total of 165 diatom species belonging to 45 genera were identiﬁed. We constructed a stratigraphic subdivision and
correlation according to the characteristics of diatom assemblages together with14C dating and carbonate analysis. We also discuss the
sedimentary environment in the sea area since the last glacial times. The research shows that the diatom assemblages coincide with inter-
glacial and glacial times, and changes in diatom abundance reﬂect the instability of the climate in the southern part of the SCS, such thatshort-term, temperature descending events correlate with the interglacial interval. The abundance of diatoms is relevant to interglacial
and glacial times, since high abundance values were associated with an interglacial interval, and low abundance values with the last gla-
cial maximum. We assume that strong upwelling developed in the interglacial interval, the development of which was inﬂuenced by vari-ations of monsoons in the East Asian region.

1. Introduction
The South China Sea (SCS) is one of the largest mar-
ginal seas of the western Paciﬁc Ocean. This sea is sensitive
to environmental change because of its unique geographiclocation and terrain conditions. The SCS is located in theEast Asian monsoon zone and experiences the earliest
onset of the Asian summer monsoon [1]. In recent years,
with many cruises of the German research vessel Sonne
to the SCS and the operation of ODP Leg 184, studieson the paleoenvironment of the SCS receive more andmore attention. In the past, many scholars have conductedstudies of paleobiota in this region, such as foraminifera[2,3], radiolarians [4,5], calcareous nannofossils [6],sporopollen [7,8] and diatoms [9,10] , to investigate the
development of paleo-oceanic environments in the SCS.However, among these studies of the sedimentary coreand column samples, the ones aiming to make high-resolu-tion surveys of diatom-bearing sediments were mainly car-ried out in the northern part of the SCS. Few studies of thesedimentary diatoms in core samples have been derived
from the southern part of the region. Speciﬁcally, the only
report on diatoms was made from core ODP 1143 [11].
Unfortunately, the sampling interval of this core was toolong (low resolution) to identify paleoenvironmentalchanges in this area. Moreover, diatoms have siliceous skel-etons and require diﬀerent eco-environmental conditions topreserve them compared to calcareous microfossils. Thus,to completely identify the characteristics of the paleo-oce-
anic environment, we must describe the structure and com-
position of all types of organisms living in these settings.

Through high-resolution studies of core SA08-34 from the
southwestern continental slope of the SCS, together withresults of
14C dating and carbonate analysis, this paper
intends to explain the evolution of paleoenvironments inthe SCS region since last glacial times.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Core SA08-34 was sampled from the southwestern con-
tinental slope of the SCS (8 /C17654.9660
0N, 110 /C17659.86200E)
(Fig. 1 ) at 1834 m water depth. The core is 778 cm long.
The lithology of core samples is almost the same, mainly
composed of caesious clay and silty clay. No turbidity cur-
rent sediment was found. Diatom analyses of 106 sampleswere conducted within 8 cm intervals, with the exceptionof a few samples collected at 4 cm intervals.
The data on carbonate analysis and
14C dating for this
core sample were provided by the Guangzhou MarineGeological Survey. The results of
14C dating (without
age correction) were 10,890 ± 350 aBP in the interval of
162–165 cm, 21,080 ± 1,000 aBP in the interval of 460–
463 cm, and >30,000 aBP in the interval of 765–768 cm.
2.2. Methods
Dry samples of 10 g were obtained by weighing with an
electronic balance. The samples were then placed in a 10 ml
small test tube with distilled water. All samples were scat-
tered with an ultrasonic sonicator for 3 min and then ﬁl-
tered with a bolting cloth with 15 lm holes. The
remaining solution was transferred into centrifugal tubesand ﬁxed onto slides with Canadian balsam. All specieswere identiﬁed and counted through an optical biologicalmicroscope. More than 300 diatom valves were countedfor each sample. Diatom species identiﬁcations were per-formed following Jin [12–14] , Lan et al. [9]and Guo [15].3. Results and discussion

3.2. Ecological characteristics of diatoms
In order to better classify diatom assemblages in Late
Pleistocene sediments of the SCS and to interpret the envi-
ronmental changes in the core, 18 types of eco-environ-ments were identiﬁed for diatoms in the SCS ( Table 1 ).
This list is based on research ﬁndings by Chinese scholars,Jin Dexiang and Wang Kaifa, regarding the distribution ofdiatoms in surface sediments in areas of the China Sea andPaciﬁc Ocean.
3.3. Characteristics of diatom assemblages in core SA08-34
According to the abundance and distribution of major
diatom specie
s and the main thermophilic, warm-water
and coastal diatom species, the core sample can be divided
from bottom to top into three diatom zones ( Figs. 2 and 3 ).
Zone I is located in the range from 515 to 778 cm and
contains assemblages of C. nodulifer ,C. stylorum and B.
hyalinum . The remarkable characteristic of this zone is
the major diatom species that vary widely in abundance.The peak abundance (168,000 diatoms/g dry sample, simi-
larly hereinafter) occurs in the interval from 621 to 629 cm.
This zone also can be further divided into three sub-zones.
The ﬁrst sub-zone is located in the range from 739
to 778 cm and contains assemblages of C. nodulifer,
C. stylorum and C. radiatus. The average percentages of
main thermophilic, warm-water and coastal diatom speciesin this sub-zone were 46.3, 6, and 19.9%, respectively.
The second sub-zone is located in the range from 699 to
739 cm. Diatoms are sparse in this sub-zone, and include C.
nodulifer and C. stylorum . The peak abundance was only
Fig. 1. Sampling station.1414 M. Sun et al. / Progress in Natural Science 19 (2009) 1413–141893 diatoms/g, which might be the reﬂection of one cooling
event.
The third sub-zone is located in the range from 515
to 699 cm and contains assemblages of C. nodulifer ,
C. stylorum ,B. hyalinum and C. radiatus . The average
percentages of these four diatoms were 44.7, 9.1, 6.5, and5.7%, respectively. The average percentages of mainthermophilic, warm-water and coastal diatom species were50.8, 2.1, and 2.6%, respectively.
As far as the three smaller zones are concerned, the ﬁrst
and third sub-zones reﬂect warm climatic characteristics,but the second one reﬂects cold climatic characteristics.Zone II is located in the range from 162 to 515 cm, and
is a diatom poor zone. According to the abundance and
distribution of diatoms, this zone also can be divided from
bottom to top into three sub-zones.
The ﬁrst sub-zone is located in the range from 415 to
515 cm and contains assemblages of C. nodulifer ,C. radia-
tusandC. stylorum . The average percentages of these three
diatoms were 40.5, 10.7, and 6.6%, respectively. In addi-tion, there also were signiﬁcant numbers of B. hyalinum
andT. excentrica . In this sub-zone, the average percentage
of main thermophilic, warm-water and coastal diatom spe-cies were 45.9, 5.1, and 11.9%, respectively.Table 1

Fig. 2. Diatom assemblages and dominant species in core SA08-34.M. Sun et al. / Progress in Natural Science 19 (2009) 1413–1418 1415The second sub-zone is located in the range from 293
to 415 cm and contains assemblages of C. nodulifer ,
C. stylorum ,R. tesselata andT. excentrica . The abundance
and species composition of diatoms in this sub-zone were
low. The mean abundance was 223 diatoms/g. The meanpercentages of the four diatoms in this sub-zone were51.9, 21.6, 2.5 and 2.3%, respectively.
The third sub-zone is located in the range from 162 to
293 cm. Diatoms are sparse in this sub-zone and includeC. stylorum ,C. nodulifer andM. sulcata .
In general, the mean abundance of diatoms in Zone II
was very low, which indicates clear sedimentary changesin the environment. Compared with Zone I, the ﬁrst sub-zone of Zone II had low numbers of main thermophilicand warm-water diatom species. The climate during accu-mulation of sediment in this zone must have been colderthan that of Zone I.
Zone III is located in the range from 0 to 162 cm and
contains assemblages of C. nodulifer, R. tesselata and M.
sulcata . This zone has a high diversity of diatom species.
The peak abundance was 87,000 diatoms/g, and the lowestabundance was 134 diatoms/g. The mean abundance was44,000 diatoms/g. The mean percentages of the threedominant diatoms in this zone were 42.7, 7.1, and 5.2%,respectively. The mean percentage of main thermophilic,warm-water and coastal diatom species were 55.9, 0.8,and 8.4%, respectively. This assemblage zone demonstrates
typical features of tropical pelagic ﬂora, similar to modern
sedimentary environments.
3.4. Chronological framework
Many results of the carbonate contents in core samples
from the SCS show that carbonate cycles above the ther-
mocline (below 3000 cm) belong to the Atlantic type. The
curve of percent calcium carbonate is parallel to that ofbenthic foraminifer oxygen isotopes, low during glacialtimes and high during interglacial times. It also corre-sponds well with the two curves of core MD05-2897, close
to core SA08-34 [16]. Therefore, the plot of percent CaCO
3
in core SA08-34 can serve as a proxy for correlated strata
of the oxygen isotope curve. According to14C dating and
a comprehensive analysis of the features of the percentCaCO
3plot for core SA08-34, we can determine that core
SA08-34 encompasses the oxygen isotope stage MIS3(P30 kyr), since the last glacial times, and the positions
at 162 and 515 cm correspond to the respective lower
boundaries of MIS1 and MIS2, respectively. Their ages
are, respectively, 10 and 24 kyr BP; and positions below515 cm correspond to the upper parts of MIS3.
3.5. The sedimentary environment of the southwestern
continental slope of the SCS since the last glacial period
The diatom zones divided according to their abundance
and the variation of their percentages correspond to diﬀer-ent oxygen isotope stages ( Fig. 3 ). The statistical results of
diatom identiﬁcation show that the individual abundanceof diatoms in the strata varied during diﬀerent periods.Generally, the abundance was low during the last glacialmaximum and high during the interglacial interval.
(1) The last interstadial (515–778 cm) corresponds to
upper parts of the MIS3 stage. This interval contains caes-ious calcareous biogenic clays, and the interlayer containscaesious siliceous calcareous silty clays. The mean diatomabundance was high, which reﬂects high biological produc-tivity in this depositional interval. Moreover, the variationof diatom abundances is large, which indicates climaticinstability. A low abundance of diatoms occurs in the inter-val from 699 to 739 cm, which might be the reﬂection of
one cooling event. While researching on planktonic foram-
inifera, Wu Lushan also noticed this phenomenon [17].
Fig. 3. Diatom abundance, and distribution of main thermophilic, warm-water and coastal diatom species, and CaCO 3from core SA08-34.1416 M. Sun et al. / Progress in Natural Science 19 (2009) 1413–1418According to the absolute age determination data, the
paleo-oceanic event recorded by the diatom ﬂora mightbe the Heinrich cooling event during the late Pleistocene.This interval is usually considered to fall within the warminterstadial, but considering the characteristics of diatomassemblages, the main thermophilic diatom species-content
is lower than that during post-glacial times. Therefore, we
can conclude that the paleo-climate in this interval wascolder than that during the post-glacial period.
(2) The last glacial maximum (162–515 cm) corresponds
to stage MIS2. Below 450 cm, this interval contains caes-ious calcareous biogenic clays, and above 450 cm caesiouscalcareous biogenic silty clays. The diatom abundance hereis low and decreasing. Radiolarians become fewer, even
devoid in some intervals. However, the abundance of
planktonic foraminifera is relatively stable [17]. Appar-
ently, the record of diatom changes shows that thepaleoecological setting in this interval was not conduciveto the growth and preservation of siliceous planktonicmicroorganisms, but did not have an obvious eﬀect on cal-careous planktonic microorganisms. From Fig. 3 , it is evi-
dent that at the early stage of MIS2, the quantity of
diatoms decreases sharply, as do the percentages of the main
thermophilic diatom species. These sudden changes demon-strate abrupt events occurring in the paleoenvironment.During the middle and late MIS2 stage (162–415 cm), dia-toms become extremely rare, which results in content devia-tions of special species. Therefore, based on data for diatompercentages in the study interval, it is diﬃcult to determinethe detailed characteristics of climate changes.
(3) The post-glacial period (0–162 cm) corresponds to
the MIS1 stage. This interval contains caesious calcareousbiogenic silty clays, and the interlayer contains brown greycalcareous biogenic clays. Diatoms are abundant in theinterval, which indicates that the paleoenvironment wasconducive to the growth and preservation of siliceousplanktonic microorganisms. The boundary of the Holoceneis clearly reﬂected by the abundance of diatoms.
Because the research area is far from a continental mar-
gin, the upper water is in poor nutritional condition, whichdeters the growth of diatoms and other phytoplankton spe-cies. Thus, the quantity of sedimentary diatoms is small.On the other hand, the SCS is inﬂuenced by monsoonsall year round, so upwelling moves frequently throughlocal sea areas. The abundance of diatoms is high withinareas of upwelling, but low in other sea areas [18]. The
changes in diatom abundances during glacial and intergla-cial intervals might indicate the development of upwelling.We can presume that the upwelling was strong in the areaduring the interglacial interval. However, the growth ofupwelling is also under the inﬂuence of monsoons, and inthe southern part of the SCS the upwelling is mainly drivenby summer monsoons. Therefore, we can evaluate the evo-lution of the East Asian monsoon in this region since the
last glacial times. During the interglacial interval, winter
monsoons are weak, but summer monsoons are strong.Powerful summer monsoons help upwelling develop andprovide plenty of nutritious material for diatoms in theupper water column. In this case, diatoms bloom, andare well preserved in sediments. However, during theglacial interval, the inverse occurs. Winter monsoonshardly trigger the upwelling, so the upper water columnalways lacks nutritious material, and hence does not sup-
port the multiplication and preservation of siliceous
microorganisms.
4. Conclusion
(1) A total of 165 diatom species belonging to 45 genera
were identiﬁed from cores SA08-34. Of these, nine
dominant species were B. hyalinum, C. nodulifer ,C.
radiatus ,C. stylorum ,M. sulcata ,R. tesselata ,T.
excentrica ,T. simonsenii , and T. nitzschioides .
According to the abundances and percentage ofmajor diatom species, the core samples can be dividedfrom bottom to top into three diatom zones.
(2) According to
14C dating and the comprehensive anal-
ysis of the features of the curve of percent CaCO 3of
core SA08-34, we can determine that core SA08-34corresponds to the oxygen isotope stage MIS3(P30 kyr), since the last glacial times. Diatom assem-
blages coincide with interglacial and glacial intervals,and changes in diatom abundance reﬂect the instabil-ity of the climate in the south of the SCS, such thatshort-term temperature descending events haveoccurred during the interglacial interval.
(3) The abundance of diatoms is relevant to the intergla-
cial and glacial interval. We suspect that strongupwelling developed in the interglacial interval. The
development of the upwelling was inﬂuenced by vari-
ations of monsoon periods, which furthermorerevealed the evolution of the East Asian monsoonin this region, since the last glacial times. Duringthe interglacial interval, winter monsoons are weakbut summer monsoons are strong, whereas the glacialmaximum reﬂects the inverse conditions.
