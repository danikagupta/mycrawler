Abstract 11 
 12 
Up to 84,000 tons of dyes can be lost in water and 90 million tons of water are attributed 13 
annually to dye production and their application, mainly in the textile and leather industry, 14 
making dyestuff industry responsible for up to 20% of the industrial water pollution. The 15 
majority of dyes industrially used today are aromatic compounds with complex, reinforced 16 
structures, with anthraquinone dyes being the 2nd largest produced in terms of volume. Despite 17 
the progress on decolourisation and degradation of azo dyes, very little attention has been given 18 
to anthraquinone dyes. Anthraquinone dyes pose a serious environmental problem as their 19 
reinforced structure makes them difficult to be degraded naturally. Existing methods of 20 
decolorisation might be effective but are neither efficient nor practical due to extended time, 21 
space and cost requirements. Attention should be given to the emerging routes for dye 22 
decolorisation via the enzymatic action of oxidoreductases, which have already a strong 23 
presence in various other bioremediation applications. This review will discusses the presence 24 
of anthraquinone dyes in the effluents and ways for their remediation from dyehouse effluents, 25 
focusing on enzymatic processes.  26 
  27 1. INTRODUCTION – THE PROBLEM 28 
 29 
A very important factor of our life is water, as it is not only vital for our physical existence but 30 
it is also necessary for numerous activities in domestic and industrial fields, varying from 31 
cleaning and agriculture to cooking and product formation1. Unsustainable exploitation and 32 
uncontrollable contamination are currently the “hot issues” regarding water management. The 33 
limited water resources need to be adequately distributed and carefully used to fulfil the 34 
constantly rising agricultural and industrial demand due to population growth1. The main 35 
strategies to address water scarcity are prevention, demand management and revalorization of 36 
water2. Following that perspective, industrial wastewater should be recycled and reused.    37 
The dye sector and the sectors relevant to dye applications (textile, tannery, paper) are 38 
recognized among the most polluting industries, based on both the volume and the composition 39 
of  effluents 3, 4. Effluents released in the water bodies create aesthetic and environmental issues 40 
5, 6 with a high societal unacceptance. Furthermore, they can cause pipe corrosion, blockages 41 
and bioaccumulation 7,  and result in the production of hazardous sludge 7. The presence of 42 
dyes in effluents makes their reuse difficult, as the presence of colour – and other substances – 43 
affects consecutive dyeing cycles7. 44 
Awareness of environmental protection has increased and minimization of water usage and 45 
wastewater production is required, in addition to the limitation on the amount of pollutants 46 
released to the environment. There are legislations regulating and monitoring the dyeing 47 
industry in Europe and the United States 8, 9, however these are not clearly defined and not 48 
comparable across countries in regards to the colour intensity of the discharged effluents9. 49 
These issues make the monitoring of coloured effluents released in the environment quite a 50 
challenge. The problem of the dye contaminated water is especially evident in Asia, which 51 
contributes to about 50 % of textile exports and more than 50 % of world’s consumption  of 52 dyes. However, many of the countries involved lack sufficient legislation about environmental 53 
protection relevant to textile industries10. Having said that, there have been efforts for colour 54 
restrictions to be included in legislation 7.  55 
Although currently the relevant legislation might be vague and not properly applied 11-16, it is 56 
clear that not only the volume of discharged effluents needs to be minimized, but the quality 57 
of industrial effluents discharged in the environment needs to be fully monitored as well.  58 
The dyeing and textile industry is responsible for dye discharge in the effluents, as well as for 59 
a plethora of other hazardous and potentially hazardous substances. Such substances, mostly 60 
surfactants and persistent organics, are used to accentuate dye stability/fastness or colour 61 
intensity, to assist the process of dyeing and to give specific characteristics to textiles among 62 
others 3, 17.  63 
It is difficult to quantify the amount of dyes lost during production or during application on 64 
textiles, as the available figures from the literature are based on estimations, or are 65 
representative of very specific types of dyes or applications. Nevertheless, it is important to 66 
discuss those data to understand the importance of the problem. Dye production may vary 67 
between 10,0008 and 770,00018 tons per year and the losses are estimated around 2 % during 68 
production and around 10 % during application7, with wastewaters being discarded directly 69 
into the environment in developing countries 19. Based on the data from 2013, the annual 70 
production of textiles was around 30 million tons, increasing every year 18. Each ton of textile 71 
requires around 30 tons of water for the dyeing process10, while each ton of dye production 72 
requires an average of 200 tons of water 5, 20. That means a total of 80 million tons and 90 73 
million tons of water respectively is attributed to dye production and textile dyeing process of 74 
per year. Taking into account the amount of contaminated water (2 % and 10 % respectively 75 
during their production and application), a staggering sum of about 11 million tons of water is 76 polluted per year, making the dyestuff industry responsible for about 20 % of the total industrial 77 
water pollution 21 . It is thus evident that water pollution from dyes is an existing and growing 78 
problem that demands attention.    79 
The majority of dyes industrially used today are aromatic compounds with complex, reinforced 80 
structures, leading to difficult degradation 18. Of the industrially important dye categories 81 
(Figure 1 ), the most common “azo” dyes are making up of almost 60 % of the synthetic dyes 82 
used industrially, followed by “anthraquinones” (15 %), and indigoids in respect of the 83 
chromophore group present22.   84

While for azo dyes, relevant data is easily available, it is difficult to find current or accurate 88 
data for the annual production of AQ dyes. Nevertheless, data found from previous years can 89 
be used to roughly estimate a production volume. For the US, within a period of about 15 years 90 
(1986-2002), the annual production of anthraquinone (a precursor for dyes and other 91 chemicals) had a staggering 5,000 % increase (from 500 to 25,000 tons)23. Given the increase 92 
in production volume of dyes, it is safe to assume that the production of AQ dyes increased as 93 
well; a rough estimation of about 100,000 tons of AQ dyes per year can be made.     94 
The specific chemistry of the anthraquinone group is based on the anthracene and consists of 95 
three fused benzene rings (basic anthracene structure) with two carbonyl groups on the central 96 
ring (highlighted in Figure 1). This structure is naturally colourless, but substitution of the 97 
aromatic rings gives colour and controls its intensity24. Colour gets deeper with increased 98 
basicity of the substituents, for an aniline-based substituent (NHC 6H5) is used, the maximum 99 
absorption length rises to from 327nm (case of H) to 508nm24.  100 
The difference from azo dyes is that in the anthraquinone structure, the carbonyl group acts as 101 
an electron acceptor, thus requiring an electron donor to react and break their structure 5. This 102 
combined with resonance effects among the anthracene structure leads to higher difficulty in 103 
AQ dyes degradation compared to azo dyes 19, 25 and makes the choice of an appropriate 104 
degradation/decolorisation method challenging 26. The majority of the industrially important 105 
AQ dyes are derived from anthraquinonesulfonic acids, using sulfonation or nitation 27, and 106 
research has shown that presence of sulfone groups in dye structure can reduce their 107 
degradability 28. Due to their highly stable structure, AQ dyes are known for their great fastness, 108 
stability and brightness24. 109 
2. AVAILABLE METHODS FOR DECOLORISATION 110 
2.1. Industrially available methods 111 
 112 
The most known and extensively applied methods in the industry are adsorption, coagulation, 113 
membrane filtration, as well as various oxidative processes 10, 29. Regarding biological methods, 114 
aerobic and anaerobic processes are currently widely applied for general water treatme nt, 115 
offering distinct advantages compared to physicochemical methods (e.g. products of added 116 value, environmentally friendlier), but also facing challenges regarding their efficiency (e.g . 117 
sensitivity, long contact time) 29. There are many examples of papers reviewing the current and 118 
future industrial methods for general dye decolorisation 3, 8, 30- 34. Every method has advantages 119 
and disadvantages related to the following criteria: efficiency under various conditions, 120 
practicality, requirements of pre- and post-treatment and environmental impact; ultimately 121 
relating to the cost.  Given this complexity, a single method can rarely satisfy these demands 122 
simultaneously 5, hence, typically, a combination of available and under-development methods 123 
is preferred, maximizing their strengths and compromising their disadvantages 17, 29.  124 
Despite the significant amount of research about the decolorisation and degradation methods 125 
applied for azo dyes 6, 35- 39, not much research is available on AQ dyes, with only two reviews 126 
available, both discussing AQ dye decolorisation mainly by biological methods 40, 41 and 127 
comparably fewer research papers compared to those available on azo dyesa. What is worth 128 
mentioning, is that there is a review paper focusing on the degradation of a specific AQ dye, 129 
reactive Blue 19, covering various methods and research examples dated up to 2011 42.  130 
2.2. Physical, chemical and biological methods applied for AQ 131 
dye removal 132 
 133 
The most common physical methods for treatment of dye house effluents are adsorption, and 134 
filtration (using membranes and reverse osmosis). As there are numerous research studies on 135 
dye removal assisted by adsorption, we have summarised the best performing literature 136 
findings on AQ dye removal and degradation in Table 1, with associated comments, while 137 
below we discuss selected examples. Best performance was arbitrarily evaluated based on the 138 
amount of dye removed per litre, per hour, assuming continuous use of the system described at 139 
the optimal state identified by the researchers. This arbitrary metric allows for a comparison 140 
                                                           
a  about   500  papers   on anthraquinone dye degradation compared   to  about   8,700  for   azo  dyes,   according   
to  Web  of  Knowledge   search   engine   over  the  period   of  1975   to  2019. between results found in literature, as given the lack of a consistent approached followed, 141 
superficial comparison of results does not produce valuable conclusions.   142 
2.2.1.Physical methods 143 
Amongst many adsorbents explored such as activated carbon, peat, silica-based adsorbents, 144 
zeolites or other naturally derived substances, activated carbon is widely studied for dye 145 
adsorption. It is also the dominant adsorbent in industry, based on its great adsorption ability, 146 
high surface area, stability and homogeneity 43, which compromise the high cost of production 147 
and regeneration and the possibility of decreased efficiency due to material loss during 148 
regeneration 8, 44, 45. A few examples using activated carbon for AQ dye adsorption showed that 149 
uptake was higher for acidic solutions 46-48, and that pore structure of the materials could 150 
facilitate 46, 48 or hinder 47 adsorption.  Another frequently discussed option in the area of 151 
adsorption are the abundant in nature zeolites, with substantially lower adsorption capacity and 152 
again facing high regeneration costs 49, 50. Silicon based materials have been studied extensively 153 
for pollutants adsorption as well 51, 52. Their interesting properties such as ability for a wide 154 
range of pore size and surface areas, durability, ease of functionalisation and relatively chea per 155 
regeneration compared to activated carbon, have made them excellent candidates for water 156 
treatment with many examples on dye adsorption 53-56. However, issues such as manufacturing 157 
and regeneration cost as well as diffusional limitations arising from high throughput in 158 
industrial scale applications, have prevented them from being widely applied in water treatment 159 
yet, although research is showing positive signs on their industrial implementation 57. Newer 160 
trends in adsorption, with application for AQ dyes, include the use of agricultural waste 58, 59. 161 
As per filtration, the usually encountered textile effluent treatments include nanofiltration (pore 162 
diameter up to 10 nm) and reverse osmosis 60, but there was no example of their application on 163 
AQ dyes found in literature.  164 Major issues about the application of physical methods for dye removal are the relatively high 165 
required contact time, hence large spaces required, as well as the need for adsorbent (or 166 
membrane) regeneration, issues that are not usually addressed in literature, but are of great 167 
importance for industrial implementation.  168 
2.2.2.Chemical methods 169 
2.2.2.1.  Coagulation – Flocculation  170 
The most common chemical treatment methods applied to textile effluents are chemical 171 
coagulation and oxidation processes, while electrochemical methods are gaining attention as 172 
well (Table 1). Chemical coagulation or flocculation is being replaced by newer methods or  173 
used in combination with other methods, in order to reduce the effect of some major drawbacks 174 
such as potentially toxic sludge production and need for further treatment of the effluent 61. 175 
The principle of coagulation and flocculation methods is the opposite charge between the 176 
soluble pollutant (e.g. dye) and the usually aluminum, iron, or most recently polymeric 177 
coagulant, that makes the pollutant become insoluble 61. The factors of importance during 178 
coagulation are the type and dose of coagulant needed and the size and “sturdiness” of the 179 
floccs (coagulated pollutants), which dominates their ease of removal 62. Table 1 summarises 180 
some distinct examples of AQ dye treatment using chemical methods, while we elaborate on 181 
relevant research below. When degradation of Reactive Blue 19 and 49, individually and in  a 182 
mixture, was attempted using active chlorine, it was shown that degradation was much faster 183 
for individual dyes 63. Contradicting these findings, decolorisation of Disperse Blue 3 via 184 
coagulation with magnesium chloride or ferrous sulphate, as individual dye or in mixture with 185 
azo dyes, showed that there is a synergistic effect. Dye removal increased from 68 % 186 
(individual dye) to up to 90 % (mixture with azo dyes) in presence of ferrous sulphate, whereas 187 
for magnesium chloride the decolorisation percentage was maintained very high, at 93 %, 188 
regardless the presence of other dyes 64. 189 2.2.2.2.  Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOP) 190 
The available oxidative methods include Fenton’s process with or without external energy 191 
supply, or ozonation, and they operate via the production of active OH- radicals that non- 192 
selectively oxidise dyes 65. Their application in water treatment has been illustrated recently 28, 193 
34, 65, 66 gaining much attention over the last few years. Selected stellar examples of AOP applied 194 
for AQ dye degradation are shown in Table 1 and some of them are discussed below. Studies 195 
on Reactive Blue 19 conducted by different groups, using the same starting concentration (100 196 
mg/mL) but different combination of AOP, showed highly different results. It was shown that 197 
using a combination of methods such as Fenton reaction coupled with adsorption on pyrite ash 198 
67, or ozonation coupled with UV radiation68 can be much more efficient compared to ozonation 199 
only 69, based on the . Using the same dye on a much higher starting concentration (about 2,000 200 
mg/L) and examining its d ecolorisation by Fenton’s reaction, photocatalysis and UV radiation, 201 
as single methods or combined, Radovic resulted in generally very high dye removal (above 202 
90 % for a combination of Fenton reagent coupled with photocatalysis) 70. This shows that 203 
combination of AOP methods does work synergistically, and usually better than single 204 
methods. What is worth highlighting about AOP when applied in AQ dye degradation, is the 205 
very short reaction times required, usually few minutes, their very good efficiency and 206 
mineralisation of dye, but also their high cost, which poses difficulties on their consideration 207 
for scale-up 71, 72.   208 
2.2.2.3.  Combination of methods 209 
Emerging combinations of the once very popular chemical coagulation with newer dye removal 210 
methods are implemented, in order to reduce the effect of some major drawbacks such as sludge 211 
production and need for further treatment of the effluent 61. Electrochemical coagulation 212 
producing in-situ coagulants based on aluminium or iron, showed great dye removal potential 213 
(Reactive Blue 19 was used as a representative AQ dye, but other dyes were studied as well) 214 
and associated time 73. That work also presented an economic evaluation of some 215 decolorisation processes, which suggested that electrochemical and oxidative processes are 216 
advantageous to adsorption, however, biological/enzymatic methods were not included. 217 
Furthermore, what was only acknowledged but not commented further is sludge production 218 
and the need to deal with it, but, it was shown qualitatively that use of different conditions can 219 
have an effect on the amount and type of produced sludge. In the area of coupling 220 
photocatalysis with nanoparticles, a study optimised the degradation of Acid Green 25 using 221 
immobilised TiO 2 nanoparticles coupled with UV light photocatalysis, resulting at an 222 
optimised system operating at a relatively low dye concentrations (18 mg/mL) 74. The same 223 
group  examined the importance of the chemical structure of various dyes in degradation 224 
through the same method 28. Their critical review analysis showed that degradation of AQ dyes 225 
was more difficult compared to azo dyes –without further elaboration on the differences 226 
between the dye structures – and also that presence of sulfone groups reduces the efficiency of 227 
dye degradation.  The application of other nanomaterials for AQ dye degradation from effluents 228 
is gaining more and more attention, although not yet thoroughly developed, but their potential 229 
advantages lead to an increased interest for their industrial application 75. A study coupling use 230 
of zinc and titanium oxides with photocatalysis by irradiation, showed that nanoparticles can 231 
be quite effective in degradation of a model AQ dye, but their efficiency depends on the type 232 
25. A more recent study examined the degradation of Reactive Blue 4 based on the coupled use 233 
of copper nanoparticles and showed that initially the dye gets adsorbed onto the nanoparticles 234 
and then is oxidised based on the production of hydroxyl radicals from added mediators and 235 
the action of monovalent copper 76.  236 
2.2.3.Biological methods  237 
 238 
The available biological methods can be divided on whether they are performed inside a cell 239 
(of bacteria, fungi, yeasts, algae), or using isolated enzymes. The challenge is to create methods 240 based on bioremediation that can bypass the disadvantages of conventional methods, yet be 241 
efficient, cost-effective and environmentally benign 77, 78. 242 
Degradation of AQ dyes using aerobic and anaerobic cultures has been reviewed recently 40, 41, 243 
so in Table S1 we report some newer (or unreported) examples on biological degradation of 244 
AQ dyes. Some of the clear differences between research examples on biological and non- 245 
biological methods include the usually low starting concentration of dyes examined and the 246 
longer time needed for decolorisation in biological methods. Although usually individual 247 
cultures are examined in research papers, a recent study 79 showed that when the 248 
microorganisms were acting in a consortium, the decolorisation of Reactive Blue 4 and 19 was 249 
dramatically improved. Another study 80 examined Escherichia coli  cultures for degradation of 250 
AQ dyes at higher concentration and found that dye decolorisation occurred primarily due to 251 
microbial induced precipitation, followed by adsorption on cells and cell metabolism. A very 252 
interesting observation was that the dye structure affected the decolorisation mechanisms and 253 
the kinetics, indicating that this method might not be applicable in real effluents where a 254 
mixture of dyes is present. When the degradation of a mixture of dyes was examined, (including 255 
Acid Blue 350 of AQ structure) using a specific strain of Trametes Versicolor , over 90 % 256 
degradation could be achieved for after 48 h of treatment, that being slightly lower to the almost 257 
complete decolorisation achieved for the individual dyes 81.              258 
Upon comparison of the –arbitrary- throughput value calculated for the examples shown for 259 
physical/chemical and biological methods, it is evident that biological methods cannot compare 260 
in terms of efficiency with the chemical and physical methods examined. This leads to the 261 
conclusion that biological methods might not be as effective as physical and chemical methods 262 
However, biological methods are generally recognised as more benign, environmentally 263 
friendly and economically viable, with the ability for in-situ degradation of pollutants, 264 compared to physical removal of the dye or transformation to other substances requiring further 265 
treatment 82, 83. 266 
2.3. Challenges with current methods 267 
 268 
Based on the data discussed and presented in Table 1, it is clear that AQ dye removal, is highly 269 
specific to the dye and the method used. It has been shown that different degrees of 270 
decolorisation are observed for a single dye when using different treatment methods 84, 85. It 271 
can be quite difficult to choose an appropriate method among the available conventional 272 
methods to decolorise AQ dyes, due to their fused ring structure that enhances their stability 273 
86. Although anthraquinone on its own is not toxic 23, research has shown that some AQ dyes 274 
as well as their degradation intermediates (often unidentified), can be potentially toxic, few of 275 
them are mutagenic and/or potentially carcinogenic 26, 87- 90. Also the lack of data on the 276 
intermediate degradation products 91 makes it difficult to speculate any residual toxicity, as 277 
well as to find appropriate degradation pathways 26. There are research examples where a 278 
degradation pathway for a specific AQ dye has been proposed, based on collected data and in 279 
few cases the pathway has been fully determined, usually using analytical techniques to 280 
identify the by-products. This indicates that methods which can result in complete destruction 281 
of the dye structure rather than isolation or coupling with other chemicals, are in need. In these 282 
examples, anthraquinone dyes were degraded using ozonation 68, 69, 92, 93, electrochemical 283 
methods and their combinations 94 or via enzymatic degradation 95-97. A discussion on the 284 
degradation pathways on a model AQ dye by various techniques is available in Section 4. 285 
We note that most studies examined a lower dye concentration spectrum, sometimes coupled 286 
with quite a low concentration of adsorbent. These scenarios may be ideal for scanning a 287 
method or optimizing the process conditions, but they do not give information on realistic 288 
conditions of industrial applications and may cause barriers during commercialisation.  289 13 
 When using physical and chemical methods for dye removal, there is sludge generation, which 290 
can be difficult to handle, as well as the materials used cannot be regenerated easily, if at all.  291 
In addition some of these methods are not very efficient due to the large cost, time and space 292 
requirements 10. 293 
Existing literature on decolorisation of AQ dyes from water effluents, acknowledges the 294 
problem and explores potential solutions, however, the lack of consistency on the way the issue 295 
is approached highlights the need for an evaluation of proposed solutions on a consistent basis, 296 
on the merit of the potential of industrial implementation and socially acceptable practices.      297

 3. FOCUS ON ENZYMATIC DECOLORISATION  303 
 304 
Isolated enzymes are very effective as they are highly specific catalysts that produce b y- 305 
products of lower toxicity and volume. The overall process is considered environmentally 306 
friendly and less intrusive. The enzymes responsible for dye degradation belong mainly to the 307 
family of oxidoreductases, including peroxidases, reductases and laccases 17, 101. These 308 
enzymes have the ability to act on dyes by either creating precipitants that can be  easily 309 
removed or chemically transforming the dyes into compounds easily dealt with 102.   310 
The use of both isolated enzymes and the whole cell/micro-organism has considerable 311 
advantages and disadvantages. Use of isolated enzymes does not depend on 312 
culture/microorganism’s “well -being” or growth rate 101, 103, 104. Also, diffusional limitations of 313 
substrate and/or product in-between the cell compartments can be avoided as well as any other 314 
actions besides enzymatic 105-107. Isolated enzymes are relatively easier to use under harsher 315 
conditions, offer higher specificity and easier regulation of catalytic activity, as well as easier  316 
handling/storage compared to whole cells 8, 77, 108. It is also easier to implement the use of 317 
isolated enzymes in an industrial context since their development as biocatalysts can be faster 318 
than whole cells. Further, recombinant enzymes and/or their immobilisation is possible to 319 
improve the performance 108-111. On the other hand, some enzymes may require co-factors or 320 
mediators 17 and may be too specific/selective to degrade multiple dyes simultaneously 108, 109.   321 
3.1. Oxidoreductases – Peroxidases  322 
 323 
The enzymes responsible for dye decolorisation belong to the family of oxidoreductases (EC: 324 
1), which catalyse oxidation and reduction reactions, finding application in various domains 325 
varying from diagnostics to wastewater treatment and production of chemicals or potentially 326 
biofuels 112-118. They have been studied extensively for dye decolorisation and bioremediation, 327 16 
 with much research focusing on the oxidative action of laccases and peroxidases as well as the 328 
reductive action of azoreductases (azo dye specific enzymes), with many review papers 329 
available targeting dye degradation in general 104, 110, 119-121 or focusing on azo dyes 6, 38, 39, but 330 
none focusing specifically on anthraquinone dyes.   331 
Peroxidases catalyse the reduction of peroxides simultaneously with the oxidation of various 332 
organic an d inorganic substrates. This “dual action” mechanism has been named ping -pong bi 333 
bi mechanism due to the fact that the electrons liberated by the enzyme from the reduction of 334 
peroxides are recovered through the oxidation of the main substrate, with the aid of the 335 
intermediate enzymatic compounds 122.  336 
Recently peroxidases from white-rot fungi (WRF) have attracted interest in the general area of 337 
bioremediation 84, 104, as actions such as lignin degradation and dye degradation are dominated 338 
by similar mechanisms, around structurally similar substrates 123, 124. The advantage of non- 339 
specific binding of WRF peroxidases allows them to act on a wide range of substrates 125, 126. 340 
Enzymes secreted from WRF include various known peroxidases, like manganese, lignin and 341 
versatile peroxidase and a less known category of enzymes, dye decolorising peroxidases 342 
(DyPs). DyPs were first reported almost 20 years ago, showing a great activity over the 343 
decolorisation of anthraquinone dyes 97, 127, followed by lignin-like compounds 128. Although 344 
their action mechanism resembles that of other peroxidases, anthraquinone dye degradation is 345 
not yet fully mapped 129-134. The characterization of DyPs can be found in recent reviews 135-346 
138. Anthraquinone dyes used as a model system to examine decolorisation using DyPs include 347 
Reactive Blue 19 (RB19 or RBBR) 129, 139-143 and Reactive Blue 5 (RB5) 97, 130, 144- 151. 348 
3.2. Oxidoreductases in enzyme-based bioremediation 349 
 350 
There are quite a few examples of isolated oxidoreductases applied in dye degradation and 351 
decolorisation, some of them focusing on anthraquinone dyes (Table 2). Focusing on DyPs, 352 17 
 there are many research examples qualitatively examining their activity on anthraquinone dyes 353 
and a few researchers have tried to consider an industrial implementation. For example, 354 
recombinant DyP was used to treat Reactive Blue 19 in a single batch system and also in a step 355 
fed batch reactor 107 to assess a cyclic operation, leading to a very high decolorisation 356 
performance, regardless the soluble nature of the enzyme. However, a major concern for 357 
industrial application is the continuous ingress of effluents that can make batch treatment 358 
tricky. Another study tested free horseradish peroxidase on a single anthraquinone dye and a 359 
real effluent. The results showed that although single dye degradation was very fast and 360 
effective (90 % within 2 mins), only 52 % decolorisation was achieved for the real effluent 361 
(undefined period of time) 152. Research conducted using again horseradish peroxidase for the 362 
decolorisation of 2 anthraquinone dyes, showed that the structure of the dye affected its 363 
decolorisation, despite the similar optimised operational conditions and the high decolorisation 364 
degrees achieved 122. When laccase was examined for dye decolorising potential on several 365 
types of dyes, it was shown that there was better affinity towards the anthraquinone Reactive 366 
Blue 19, resulting in almost 90% decolorisation over 30 mins153. The preference of laccase 367 
towards anthraquinone dyes compared to other types was also confirmed by a different study, 368 
where complete decolorisation of the same dye concentration was achieved in the much higher 369 
time point of 72 h 154. However, whereas in the aforementioned cases laccase did not need a 370 
mediator, this has not been always the case. Soares 103used laccase for the decolorisation of 371 
Reactive Blue 19 and reported that in absence of mediator almost no decolorisation was 372 
observed, but upon use of mediators decolorisation was able to reach 100 % success. The 373 
different results obtained by the same combination of enzyme and dye allows us to understand 374 
the complexity of decolorisation and the difficulty to generalise results and expectations. When 375 
degradation of a mixture of 3 azo and 1 anthraquinone dye was examined using isolated enzyme 376 
extracts from Funalia Frogii , it was shown that degradation of dyes in the mixture followed a 377 18 
 pattern based on the ease of structure breakdown. Once the Reactive Blue 69 anthraquinone 378 
dye (easiest to degrade) was almost fully degraded, degradation of the other dyes would occur, 379 
leading to a time dependant decolorisation and resulting to 84 % colour removal after 48 h 155.  380 
Although enzyme use in dye degradation specifically can be quite effective under laboratory 381 
conditions, their application to an industrial scale has many limitations, mainly due to the 382 
production cost (culture, isolation, equipment) and operational cost (use/reuse, downstream 383 
processing) of the enzymes 29, 112, 156-158. Also, some of the by-products can inhibit the 384 
enzymatic action 146, 159, 160, thus limiting potential reusability of the enzymes. Furthermore, as 385 
the pH for enzymatic action is important, difficulties can occur when treating real effluents as 386 
it was shown in literature 152, 161, 162.  387 
There are mainly three ways to address the aforementioned limitations from isolated enzyme 388 
use, which can be applied alone or together. The “invasive” way is altering the properties o f 389 
the enzyme via genetic engineering. The “excluding” way is screening fo r new, better enzymes. 390 
The “external improvement” way refers to the improvements and optimization of the process 391 
and enzyme 109, 163, e.g. immobilisation, optimization of reactor configurations and design of 392 
effective downstream processing. In order for isolated enzymes to become applicable for water 393 
treatment of industrial potential, they have to be immobilised. Even if enzymatic action has 394 
been impro ved via genetic engineering and screening, the production cost of “optimised 395 
enzyme” can be inhibitory for application at industrial scale, without the option of reuse. 396 
Hence, even after overcoming limitations through the invasive or the exclusive way, external 397 
improvement –usually via immobilisation – needs to be applied. In the next section we shed 398 
light on the applicability of immobilisation, focusing on immobilised oxidoreductases and their 399 
application for dye removal.      400 19

 3.3. Immobilisation 406 
3.3.1.General information 407 
 408 
The stability of enzymes under “un -natural” conditions, enzyme production cost and the need 409 
for downstream separation are crucial for their industrial potential 166. Immobilisation is an 410 
established technique with the aim to facilitate separation and reuse of enzymes as well as 411 
maintain the most active conformation 167, 168 by “securely attaching” the enzyme onto usually 412 
solid supports that offer molecular rigidity 169. Major advantages of immobilisation include the 413 
ability for enzyme reuse and the simplified downstream processing, as well as the enhancement 414 
of operational stability of enzymes and the option for cascade reactions; ultimately offering 415 
cost effective solutions 166, 170. However, distinct disadvantages include the rigorous design of 416 
the system, which has to be tailored to the enzyme and application in mind, minimising mass 417 
transfer limitations between the enzyme and the substrates and the possibilities for enzyme 418 
deactivation 166, 170. It should be noted that immobilisation does not necessarily aim to make 419 
the enzyme perform better when it is applied in its optimal operational conditions, but to 420 
maintain or ideally increase its performance when the conditions are not optimal 171.  421 
3.3.2.Methods and supports for immobilization  422 
There are many extensive reviews on methods and supports used for enzyme immobilisation172, 423 
173 focusing on a specific support (e.g.174), immobilisation method (e.g.175, 176) or enzyme 424 
(e.g.177).  Among many available ways of immobilisation as shown in Figure 2, the most widely 425 
preferred ones are adsorption, entrapment or encapsulation and covalent bonding 174. The 426 
typical enzyme content in the final product is usually less than 10 % by weight, remaining 427 
being the support 176.  428 21 
   429 
Figure 2: Brief description of immobilisation methods, with the most commo n methods underlined (adapted 430 
from 167, 176, 178). 431 
There is not a set combination of technique, support and enzyme, as immobilisation highly 432 
depends on the targeted reaction/process, the given conditions and the possible interactions. 433 
Thus for achieving a golden mean for the factors affecting its efficiency, approaches ranging 434 
from trial and error to predictive designing of the targeted system are used 179. The selected 435 
combination should satisfy both catalytic (productivity, stability and specificity) and non- 436 
catalytic requirements (control of the process, separation, robustness and need for further 437 
processing)180. A suitable support for enzyme immobilisation should fulfil requirements in 438 
regards to mechanical properties, ease of synthesis and functionalization, environmental 439 
friendliness, leaching prevention, toxicity, loading capacity, low steric hindrance effects but 440 
high availability of reactive groups 167, 172, 181. Also, it should fulfil requirements about the 441 
microenvironment and mass transfer during enzymatic actions 169, 182. What is aimed is to create 442 
a stable and active biocatalyst that can be applied on an industrial level 172, 183, at an acceptable 443 
total cost 184, 185. Immobilised enzymes can be cost-effective if the cost of immobilisation (total 444 
cost of every step of the process) is lower than the cost of separation of soluble enzymes from 445 
22 
 the product (and of further product purification if needed), in addition to the cost of using fresh 446 
enzyme in every “catalytic round” 186.   447 
3.3.3.Anthraquinone dye decolorisation by immobilised 448 
oxidoreductases 449 
 450 
There are some reviews available on water decontamination by immobilised enzymes, focusing 451 
either on specific pollutants or on specific enzymatic sub-categories of oxidoreductases 119, 120, 452 
125, 177, 187, 188. Generally, the operational stability of enzymes is enhanced by immobilisation 453 
but the activity of the enzyme is reduced, mainly due to disruption of the active conformation, 454 
difficulty of the substrate to reach the enzyme, or deactivation of the enzyme due to 455 
accumulation of toxic substances. The decontamination efficiency highly depends on the 456 
combination of enzyme and support used, as well as on the system investigated (dye structure 457 
and concentration, presence of other substances). Hence, enzymatic performance is typically 458 
investigated by varying some of those parameters, as well as operational parameters like 459 
temperature and pH (Table 3). From Table 3 it is clear that immobilisation enhances the 460 
stability and it facilitates enzyme reusability. Some examples include increased performance 461 
of the immobilised enzyme compared to free (7 % higher performance was noted when 462 
polyphenol oxidase was immobilised) 189. It is also worth mentioning that both the available 463 
examples of immobilised DyP showed great performance of the composite, with high 464 
reusability and stability 190, 191and very high throughput, comparable to the values observed for 465 
AOPs..  466

the timescale of the decolorisation is within a few minutes, the assumption of  decolorisation ability over continuous use for 1 h is made. 472 25 
 Immobilisation of laccase on silanised alumina pellets has also shown to reduce the inhibitory 473 
effects of components usually present in industrial dye-baths such as wetting, soaping or 474 
sequestering agents 198. When decolorisation of two structurally similar anthraquinone dyes 475 
(Reactive Blue 19 and Acid Blue 25) was examined using immobilized laccase in epoxy 476 
activated Sepabeads, researchers got greatly different results (almost 0 % for Reactive Blue 19 477 
and about 40 % for Acid Blue 25), indicating that structure of dye –even if of the same general 478 
type– has an important role 199. Presence of a mediator in the examined systems increased the 479 
decolorisation of Reactive Blue 19 from 0 % to about 30 %, whereas the effect on 480 
decolorisation of Acid Blue 25 was negligible. Following the same argument, researchers 195 481 
studying the decolorisation of two anthraquinone dyes (Reactive Blue 19 and Acid green 25) 482 
using again laccase but immobilised on magnetic carbon nanoparticles, achieved highly 483 
positive results (more than 80 % decolorisation efficiency, good reusability potential, stability) 484 
for both dyes. This shows that the immobilisation support also has a great effect on 485 
decolorisation efficiency, since using the same enzyme (laccase) acting on the same dye 486 
(Reactive Blue 19) yield different results when different supports were examined. In terms of 487 
methods and matrixes used for immobilisation, looking at Table 3 one can see that adsorption 488 
on inorganic matrices – usually silicates – is highly favoured over other methods and matrices 489 
combinations. This is possibly due to the extensive research available on those materials 174, 200 490 
and their wide industrial presence 201, thus allowing easier industrial implementation of the 491 
immobilized biocatalyst. An issue usually faced with immobilisation supports is adsorption of 492 
dye on the actual support instead of decolorisation due to enzymatic action, which might lead 493 
to false results if it is not accounted for. Indeed, another study showed an initial step of dye 494 
adsorption onto the carrier (silica beads), followed by decolorisation by the enzyme (laccase), 495 
allowing for fresh substrate to be used 202. Also, another issue is the adsorption of degradation 496 
products 192, 202, which might lead to enzyme deactivation. 497 26 
 It should be noted that researchers have developed artificial enzyme mimics – namely 498 
nanozymes – that mimic specific enzymatic actions. Their action is based on a chemically 499 
synthesized active site that is very similar to the one of the targeted natural enzyme, e.g. 500 
enzymes that contain metals or metal oxides 203. So far, there have been examples mimicking 501 
the action of peroxidases 204-208 but only two reports of peroxidase mimetic nanozymes for dye 502 
decolorisation exist (for an azo, a xanthene 209 and a thiazine dye 206), and none on 503 
anthraquinone dyes. . It has been reported that nanozymes are easy to use over natural enzymes 504 
due to lower cost, easier scale-up production, higher durability and stability. However, 505 
nanozymes applications are very limited due to lack of selectivity and substrate recognition, as 506 
well as lower activity compared to natural enzymes 203, 210, 211.  507 
4. ON THE DEGRADATION PATHWAY OF 508 
ANTHRAQUINONE DYES 509 
As it has been already mentioned, it is quite difficult to confirm the degradation pathway of a 510 
dye, mainly due to the possibility of spontaneous oxidations and our inability to quickly isolate 511 
fragments. Nevertheless, there are few examples where based on the initial dye structure, some 512 
identified fragments and the identified as final products, researchers have been able to propose 513 
a degradation pathway for model anthraquinone dyes. Although Li et al.41 discuss the 514 
degradation pathway of AQ dyes by biological methods and Siddique et al.42 have collected 515 
examples of Reactive Blue 19 degradation by different methods without however touching on 516 
the degradation pathway, a comprehensive discussion around the degradation pathway of AQ 517 
dyes by various methods is missing. In Table 4  one can see a list of research examples studying 518 
the degradation of a model AQ dye (Reactive Blue 19, structure shown in Figure 1) using 4 519 
different methods and proposing degradation pathways based on the identified fragments. The 520 
chemical structure of fragments is shown in Table S2. By comparing the identified fragments, 521 
it is evident that each method can lead to different results. Degradation of Reactive Blue 19 522 27 
 using thermal-pressure hydrolysis 212 was the only case where the identified fragments were 523 
not of aromatic structure (small carboxylic acids were detected). In every other researc h 524 
example studied the identified fragments were considerably larger, especially for the 525 
examination of degradation via enzymatic action. In this case, the proposed degradation 526 
pathway did not progress mush further than the deamination of the anthraquinone structure and 527 
the ring’s rupture, as well as the deamination and desulfonation of the main auxiliary structure 528 
95. The AOPs, chemical and biological methods used for Reactive Blue 19 degradation ( Table 529 
4) resulted in phthalic acid and its derivatives (as identified products), with expectations for 530 
further degradation to lower by products, which however were not confirmed by the analytical 531 
methods used. What can be assumed based on the degradation pathways proposed is that the 532 
anthraquinone structure is eventually broken down to simpler aromatic derivatives, allowing 533 
for easier manipulation afterwards. However, this is not the case for the enzymatic methods, 534 
where degradation seems to be a more lengthy procedure 95, 97. Based on that absence of further 535 
degradation might be attributed to loss of enzymatic activity over prolonged time of use and/or 536 
exposure to the reaction mixture.   537 
A first comparison between the identified as final fragments across different methods used, 538 
show that electrochemical methods lead to generally smaller fragments, with higher 539 
mineralization potential compared to biological methods. As it can be seen in Table S3, of the 540 
most common fragments identified were phenol, phthalic acid, their derivatives and low 541 
molecular hydrocarbons. These fragments were mainly produced by the cleavage and 542 
subsequent degradation of the anthraquinone ring through various steps. In some cases it was 543 
noted that different dyes (Reactive Blue 19 213 and Reactive Blue 4 214) treated with the same 544 
method led to the same degradation products (as derived by the anthraquinone ring). This 545 
observation could be an indication of some control over the end products if a specific method 546 
is applied. However, looking more in depth into a specific method, ozonation, for the 547 28 
 degradation of the same dye, Reactive Blue 19, results from different researchers showed 548 
slightly different fragments. Identified fragments ranged from a mixture of phenol, acetic acid 549 
and propandioic acid 68, to a mixture of phenol, acetic acid and oxalic acid 92 and to a mixture 550 
of phthalic acid and unspecified carboxylic acids 69. Upon examination of the conditions used, 551 
Fanchiang et al. 69 used slightly higher ozone feed rate compared to the other studies, which 552 
might have been responsible for the higher mineralisation potential.   553 
Based on the few research examples showing a degradation pathway and fragments of A Q dyes 554 
treated using biological methods as shown in the lower end of Table S3, we can see that the 555 
identified fragments are not different to those shown for chemical and AOP methods. However, 556 
the identified fragments upon degradation using enzymes were substantially larger compared 557 
to those identified by other methods, as shown in Table S3. This observation shows that 558 
although isolated enzymes can potentially be very efficient in decolorisation, when it comes to 559 
dye breakdown and mineralisation, the requirements for degradation are higher than what 560 
currently available from enzymes. That being said, combination of enzymes, as it is the case in 561 
biological systems, might be a potential avenue to explore.  562 
It should be noted that in all the research examples examined, the suggested degradation 563 
pathways based on some identified fragments and the discussion around the specific 564 
breakdown mechanisms, show that the initial fragments could not be identified by the 565 
analytical methods used, but were speculated retrospectively. This shows the lack of control 566 
over the dye degradation reactions and the existence of spontaneous reactions that can lead to 567 
the same lower fragments via multiple paths 69, 74. With regards to the auxiliary groups present 568 
on the dye structures (such as amino-groups, sulfone-groups, halogen-groups), mapping down 569 
their degradation pathway was more difficult. Research examples either did not identify further 570 
degradation past the original rupture from the dye structure 93, 95, 214, or identified big fragments 571 
and even polymerized by-products 97.    572 29

 5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE CHALLENGES 576 
Degradation of anthraquinone dyes poses an environmental problem that has been ignored due 577 
to their smaller volume compared to azo dyes. Existing research shows that anthraquinone dyes 578 
can be sturdier when it comes to decolorisation due to their structure. Furthermore, their 579 
removal is highly specific on the dye and method used, hence it can be quite difficult to choose 580 
a single solution among the available conventional methods. Comparing the existing 581 
physical/chemical methods with the biological ones, it is clear that while every method has 582 
their distinctive advantages and disadvantages, Advanced Oxidation Processes and isolated 583 
enzymes stand out it terms of fastness of degradation. In this review we focused mainly on 584 
enzymatic decolorisation of anthraquinone dyes, and showed that it has gone a long way but 585 
still needs extensive research before industrial implementation. Immobilisation can help create 586 
powerful biocatalysts that can be both environmentally friendly and industrially applicable. 587 
Currently, immobilized oxidoreductases can show activity comparable to free enzyme when it 588 
comes to smaller substrates, but they sometimes suffer when it comes to dyes of larger sizes 589 
causing inaccessibility to the enzyme inside a porous support. 590 
A main challenge we identified during literature review, was the lack of consistency in 591 
approaches used in various research examples. This makes the comparison of the ability of 592 
suggested methods to treat anthraquinone dyes (or pollutants in general) quite tricky, as we 593 
showed that different conditions using the same method and the same dye, of using a method 594 
under the same conditions for different dyes can lead to different results. A way to 595 
circumnavigate that would be to set a benchmark set of parameters per available method, 596 
making comparison across methods easier. For example, setting a standard dye concentration 597 
for experiments, a fixed ratio of dye to enzyme, nanomaterial, oxidant or energy used. It could 598 
also mean setting an arbitrary unit that allows to compare results on a common basis, such as 599 31 
 productivity. These approaches would make comparison across methods easier, showing the 600 
strong and weak points of each method in a more comparable manner.   601 
Another challenge that became obvious across examined literature is the unrealistic approach 602 
usually followed, pinpointed by the fully controlled systems used. Although some level of 603 
control is needed to define and characterise a dye degradation system, a more realistic approach 604 
towards system development should be adopted, incorporating research on real effluents or 605 
mixtures of dyes. Although it is mainly the mixtures of dyes that are encountered in the actual 606 
effluents from textile industry, there are very limited reports examining such mixtures of dyes 607 
216-218 and even fewer that include an anthraquinone dye within the dye mixture 155, 219, 220. The 608 
absence of extended research on dye mixtures (only one review paper on dye mixture 609 
decolorisation was found 221) highlights the need to investigate the ability of existing 610 
technologies to treat a more realistic form of effluent, that being dye mixtures, or solutions 611 
containing other auxiliaries used in the textile industry. Focusing on decolorisation of 612 
anthraquinone dyes by immobilized oxidoreductases, the lack of information of the 613 
performance of such systems on real (or realistic) effluents was also noted. This can be 614 
attributed to the high sensitivity of biocatalysts towards operational conditions, but if such 615 
methods are aimed to be applied industrially, then a more realistic approach is ought to be 616 
explored.   617 
Another identified challenge with respect to dye degradation is the relatively limited available 618 
information on the degradation pathways. All the research examples proposing a degradation 619 
pathway, reached their conclusions based on a few identified fragments via analytical 620 
techniques, assuming previous and further reaction steps. The existence of free radicals and the 621 
recalcitrant structure of anthraquinone dyes make oxidation, hence degradation, difficult to 622 
predict. In a few examples in literature, there were more than one pathways proposed for the 623 
degradation of an anthraquinone dye, indicating the need for better control over the process of 624 32 
 degradation. This could be achieved through more careful control of the reaction and the 625 
development of techniques to pause the reaction before progressing further, or techniques to 626 
slow it down enough so that samples during the initial stages can be withdrawn.   627 
Finally, with regards to immobilised oxidoreductases, future studies need to tackle the “value 628 
for money” equation  when it comes to the synthesis of a biocatalyst for such a specific, yet 629 
absolutely crucial application. So far the main aim of the studied examples seems to be the 630 
performance of the biocatalyst, without trying to minimise synthesis cost. Majority of examples 631 
examined are using lengthy synthesis procedures with many subsequent steps for the materials 632 
synthesis and the immobilisation of the enzyme, and further hazardous chemicals and 633 
unsustainable practices are usually employed 189, 192, 196, 197, 199, 222- 224. These lead to final 634 
products which might tick the performance brief, but by no means tick the industrial 635 
implementation brief, rendering them basically unusable. Research should focus on the 636 
identification of a golden means between synthesising a material-enzyme complex able to 637 
perform as a powerful dye degradation agent, but also have the potential for easy and 638 
economical scale up in order to be industrially relevant.  Alternatively, research could also 639 
focus on the combination of methods in order to address their limitations and enhance their 640 
advantages. For example, initially treating anthraquinone dyes – or effluents generally – with 641 
immobilised oxidoreductases and following up with AOPs, could help minimise the energy 642 
cost associated with AOPs and prevent biocatalysts from prolonged use, hence increase their 643 
industrial potential.  644
