Introduction:  
Nitrite is one of the intermediates of  the nitrate reduc tion process  or denitrification. It is 
generally considered that the reduction rate of nitrite is higher than that of nitrate,  therefore,  
nitrite accumulation will not occur during the  denitrification process [ 1]. However, nitrite 
accumulation , in denitrification , is frequently observed. Recently, nitrite accumulation via 
denitrification was investigated in the literature as a mean s to provide substrate for anammox, an 
efficient and cost -saving process for nitrogen removal from wastewater [2]. However , the 
general operational approach is to prevent or reduce the amount of nitrite accumulation during 
conventional denitrification. In addition to elevated usage of chlorine as disinfectant, nitrite 
accumulation at threshold concentrations may cause toxic and inhibitory effects on other 
biological processes.  
Several factors including organic carbon amount and type [3], low temperature [4], carbon to 
nitrogen ratio [5], dissolved oxygen, and  phosphorus deficiency [6] have been linked to nitrite 
generation and accumulation from heterotrophic denitrifying bioreactors; however, the systematical impact of the engineered operational factors on resulting inefficient nitrate removal 
and accumulation of intermediates during denitrification in wastewater treatment processes has 
received limited attention.  
Carbon sources and the subsequent C to N ratios have been analyzed extensively  in laboratory 
batch experiments; however, the results are often in conclusive or contradictory. Batch cultures 
of Paracoccus denitricans  cultivated on either methanol, acetate or ethanol accumulated 
different amounts of nitrite at 68 -70%, 72% and 48%, respectively [7]. Another study 
investigated  the effect of methanol, ethanol, sodium acetate, sodium propionate, and glucose on 
the nitrite accumulation in denitrification . They found that methanol, ethanol, sodium acetate, 
 
4683 
 
and sodium propionate led to a peak nitrite accumulation followed by subsequent denitrification; 
however, when glucose is used as carbon source, both nitrate reduction and nitrite accumulation 
are not observed  [8]. This is different from the conclusions that previously reported significant 
nitrite accumulation in a medium with glucose  as a carbon source [7] and [9]. It was postulated 
that this phenomenon could be due to the presence of Alcaligene  species, previously reported as 
not been able to utilize glucose as electron  [10].  
The effect of C/N ratio in batch experiments using methanol as the sole carbon source wi th C/N 
ratios 2.25 to 12 found a minimum ratio of 3.75 is sufficient for the reduction of nitrate to nitrite 
but is deficient for further reduction of nitrite to nitrogen gas [8]. The  impact of the carbon 
sources citrate, acetate, and glucose with  C/N ratio s of 6.3 through 6.8 on isolated Pseudomonas 
stutzeri D6  was investigated and concluded that  Pseudomonas stutzeri D6 preferred citrate and 
acetate for dentification and that  other carbon sources highly increased the nitrite accumulation 
rate [11].   
The complexity of m icrobial communities mediate unique microbial pathway s for the 
completion of respiration and cell production and those pathways may occur at different rates. In 
wastewater practice, however, there is an enormous lack of knowledge in the exact kinetic role 
of individual bacterium in the overall kinetic rate of a biological process such as denitrification. 
The availability, reliance and cost of different microbial ecology analysis in the plant operation 
level have significant roles in t he insufficiency of the effect of microbial community in the nitrite 
accumulation during denitrification. In one rare study, nitrite and nitrous oxide accumulation was examined using three isolated pure denitrifying species of Alcaligenes odornas , Pseudomonas 
fluorescens  and Flavobacterium sp., and the observed accumulated nitrite when reducing nitrate 
in the first two (100% molar and 53% molar respectively) and not with the latest specie [12]. 
From the microbial pathway perspective, nitrite accumulation may result from a lag in synthesis 
of nitrite reductase (NiR)  [13], inhibition on NiR or even from nitrate inhibition on nitric oxide 
reductase (NoR)  [14]. It was hypothesized that if nitrate had inhibited nitrite reduction by acting 
on the nitrite r eductase (NiR) itself, such inhibition should have been observed in cells incapable 
of nitrate reduction  [12]. In a series of tests with Flavobacterium sp. and P. fluorescens cells, 
both inherently capable of complete denitrification, grown with nitrite al one reduced nitrate as 
rapidly as those grown with nitrate but cells grown with nitrite and tungstate, to prevent 
 
4684 
 
formation of an active nitrate reductase, were unable to reduce nitrate. Nitrate concentrations as 
high as 8 mM did not show any adverse effect on the rate of nitrite reduction in both 
Flavobacterium sp. and P. fluorescens , thus concluded that accumulation of nitrite seemed to 
depend on the relative rates of nitrate and nitrite reduction with different species. In addition, each isolate rapidly reduced nitrous oxide even when nitrate or nitrite had been included in the 
incubation mixture. Based on observations in the literature the accumulation of nitrite is affected by the species composition within the denitrifying community and the sludge sour ce. With 
respect to their capability to reduce nitrate and nitrite, four different groups of nitrate reducing bacteria are proposed. Group A is only capable of reducing NO
3 to NO 2 without further 
reduction of NO 2 to N2 and caused NO 2 accumulation. These incomplete denitrifying bacteria 
lacked the key NO 2 reductase enzymes. Acidovorax facilis , Citrobacter diversus , and 
Enterobacter agglomerans  were mentioned are examples of this group of bacteria [15]. Group B 
represented facultative a naerobic bacteria which reduce nitrate to nitrite, nitric oxide and nitrous 
oxide. Group B cannot grow solely on nitrous oxide (N 2O) and perhaps lack nitrous oxide 
reductase (Nos) or inhibited by NO 2 or NO 3 elevated concentrations and can only produce N 2O 
from nitrate and nitrite. Group B bacteria have shown in some cases to reduce N 2O at a very 
slow rate. Pseudomonas fluorescens , Pseudomonas chlororaphis , Pseudomonas aureofaciens , 
Azospirillum lipoferum , Azospirillum itersonii, Corynebacterium nephridia, Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, Staphylococcus sp. are proposed to be among Group B bacteria [16] Group C 
contained bacteria capable of reducing nitrate and nitrite without any nitrite accumulation. The 
nitrite reduction rates of these bacteria were reported higher  than the corresponding nitrate 
reduction rates. Group D contained bacteria capable of reducing nitrate as well as nitrite but nitrate reduction was associated with a transient accumulation of different amounts of nitrite.  In 
a quantitative study using different combination of Staphylococcus sp., Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes  and Bacillus niacini  as Group B, C and D denitrifiers respectively at different 
carbon to nitrogen ratios (C/N) when Group C was dominant (>50%) in the denitrifier biocommunity, high denitrification rates were found with no nitrite accumulation, even at low 
C/N ratio of 2.5 (excluding the cell growth). When the Group C ratio fell below 25%, significant 
nitrite accumulation occurred with incomplete nitrogen elimination (<38%)  [17In the study 
conducted by Du et al., where nitrite accumulation was observed at different C/N ratios the most 
abundant genus was identified as Thauera (67.25 %) which was a member of Î²- Proteobacteria, 
 
4685 
 
mostly identified as denitrifiers. There were some strains of Thauera capable of reducing NO 3 to 
NO2 under anaerobic condition Liu et al., 2013, which seemed consistent with the results of this 
study, in which when nitrate was added mid-way through the nitrite reduction phase, the nitrite 
reaction rate decreased by ~ 85%. It was assumed that the dominant Thauera genus in the partial 
denitrification  with high NO 2 accumulation was possibly related to the NO 2 reduction inhibition 
in the presence of NO 3, assumed by the authors to be caused by the asynchronism of denitrifying 
enzyme synthetization for different electron acceptors (NO 3 and NO 2). If Thauera is classified 
as a Group D denitrifiers, the decrease in nitrite reduction rate when nitrate was added could be because of electron acceptor preference due to a higher kinetic rate.  
It should be noted that in the majority of the studies summarized , the trend of COD reduction 
along with the reduction of nitrate to nitrite and nitrite to nitrogen gas were  not reported, thus it 
is not clear whether sequestration of carbon occurred prior to completion of denitrification. As 
stated the literature results are i nconsistent and furthermore t he effect of feast and famine 
condition on the nitrite accumulation in the denitrification process has not been understood 
thoroughly. 
Mathematical Model Development  
In this study, a model-based approach, calibrated on multiple batch tests, demonstrates a 
correlation between initial F/M ratio and electron donor half saturation constant as surrogate for 
feast-famine conditions and nitrite accumulation in denitrification process. The model was 
developed to address the internalization of carbon (whether provided as an external source or influent) at feast and famine conditions when the concentrations of influent COD or added 
external carbon source (S
ExC) in the bulk liquid is significantly higher than the internalization 
half-saturation constants (denoted as K ExC in Table 1, equations 7-9). This model has three new 
state variables and ten (10) new process rate equations, shown in Table 1. The stoichiometric 
matrix of this model is not included in the paper. The model includes process rates for the 
degradation of a non-methanol external carbon source under aerobic and anoxic conditions. To 
project the internalization ability of biomass, it is postulated that a specialist group of 
heterotrophic bacteria are capable of storing electron d onor, hence the model introduces a new 
heterotrophic biomass, called OHO2 in addition to the ordinary heterotrophic organism (OHOs), used in the Activated Sludge Model (ASM). The new model structure has three critical 
 
4686 
 
components: (1) the stoichiometric matrix which describes the mass balances; (2) the rate 
equations that describe the rates at which the model component conversions occur; and (3) the 
model parameters. The add on model rate equations were incorporated into Model Builder in the 
BioWinÂ® simulato r to demonstrate the feast and famine phenomenon based on literature data.  
Aerobic behavior of the model  
As shown in Table 1, based on experimental results reported in the literature on aerobic 
utilization of an organic matter (external carbon source in this case) by a non -enriched biomass, 
it is hypothesized for this model that normal heterotrophs can similarly utilize the external carbon source aerobically the same way as the specialist group of microorganisms (OHO
2), 
expressed as Eq (2).

Under aerobic condition and in parallel to the biological aerobic utilization of the external carbon 
source by OHOs and OHO 2, the external carbon is predominantly internalized with an 
internalization yield of É³sto, and thereafter  is used for biomass and CO 2 production. An amount 
of (1-É³sto) external carbon is directly used by OHOs and OHO 2 without any internalization. As 
shown in Eq (7), the aerobic internalization of carbon is postulated as a Monod function term of

model, the value of COD internalization yield (É³ sto) is hypothesized not to be one, meaning a 
 
4688 
 
portion of the external carbon source is used as exogenous substrate for cell growth. In support 
of the hypothesis, Moralejo-GÃ¡rate et al. (2013) observed that at high concentrations of electron 
acceptors (DO in that case), most of the assimilatory ammoniu m uptake (75% of the total) was 
established during the famine phase, indicating that growth occurred on the endogenous stored substrates (PHA and glycogen) [20]. For the low electron acceptor case, 70% of the assimilatory 
ammonium consumption occurred duri ng the feast phase, indicating that growth was 
predominantly supported by the exogenous substrate, i.e. external carbon source. The substrate was directly used for growth rather than for production of storage polymers. During the  famine 
phase, which lasted  much longer than the feast phase (22 h versus 2 h), glycogen and PHB were 
degraded as the only carbon and energy sources and supported growth and cell maintenance.  
In this model, the specialist group of bacteria (OHO
2) are the only non-PAO heterotrophs that 
can perform respiration using stored polymers. Equation (1) expressed the utilization rate of the internal stored carbon by OHO
2.  
Anoxic behavior in the model 
The model behaves very similarly anoxically when it comes to internalization of the external carbon source, Eq (9). In addition, the following assumption were made for the anoxic behavior 
of both OHOs and OHO
2 with nitrate and nitrite as electron acceptors: 
(1) nitrate or nitrite are used as electron acceptors, with nitrate being reduced sequentially to 
nitrite and then to nitrogen gas;  
(2) OHOs and OHO2 are both able to use external carbon source directly in two sequencing 
stages of denitrification (Equations 3 & 4) 
(3) The OHO 2 can perform both stages of denitrification using internalized carbon 
(Equations 3 & 4) 
The kinetic value and stoichiometric constants are not included in this manuscript.  
Results & Discussion:  
Multiple batch experiments used is a previous study [18] were simulated to evaluate the model 
accuracy as well as conduct sensitivity analys es around the kinetic parameters. Figure 1 shows a 
sample result. The figure depicts an NUR  test using glycerol-based MicroCÂ® and the modeled 
 
4689 
 
nitrate/nitrite concentration profile calculated by BioWin Â® using the AS/AD model with the 
model extension. The figure clearly shows the accumulation of nitrite during denitrification 
which was accurately predicted by the proposed model. The existing simulation platforms were 
not able to predict the nitrite accumulation phenomena at both high and low F/M ratios.

In general, based on any two- stage denitrification mathematical model, the degree of nitrite 
accumulation is assumed to be the result of the kinetics of the denitritation and denitratation 
(which vary  with different electron donors) and temperature.  However, in practice, it has been 
observed that the degree of the nitrite accumulation during denitrification p rocess is also a 
function of how an external carbon source is added into a denitrification zone ( the value of 
anoxic F/M ratio ) as well as the gradient of the F/M ratio along the denitrification reactor (PFR 
versus CSTR) , herewith denoted as feast -famine conditions. This is necessary information for 
design.

In the proposed model, this phenomenon is described by utilizing M onod-type equations for 
sequestration of the electron donor, which varies with different carbon s ources and substrate 
half-saturation constants . The rates of the sequestration of the electron donor differ based on the 
F/M ratio and the half satu ration constants of the external carbon source. As shown in Table 1, 
equations (7), (8) and (9) internalization of the carbon source via both heterotrophic 
microorganisms and the specialist group of bacteria, which  internalize COD at feast -famine 
condition, occurs at both aerobic and anoxic conditions. Based on the above equations, the degree of substrate sequestration and internalization, is a monod function of the substrate 
concentration in the bulk liquid and the electron donor half -saturation constant. As mentioned 
earlier, when the concentration of electron donor in the liquid is significantly higher than the half saturation constant, carbon sequestration and internalization will occur. Such a condition may 
happen both at high and low F/M ratio. Figur e 2 depicts a conceptual graph of the NO
2-N/NOx-
N ratio (or nitrite accumulation) at different F/M ratios a nd substrate half-saturation constants 
based on different electron donors.

Figure 2 is based on assumed Ks values for different electron donors. One of the challenges with 
demonstrating this model is a very poor knowledge of the Ks values for different electron donors 
in the literature. In addition, half saturation constant is a function of environmental factors such 
as mass transfer coefficient and therefore subjected to variation in different processes. However, 
the proposed model introduces a modeling concept to mimic feast-famine phenomenon, independent of F/M ratio and mixed liquor concentrations and based on substrate concentration 
and sequestration kinetics. This model can be calibrated and utilized for process design and 
optimization, specially for waste stream with a much better understood Ks value s such as 
municipal waste streams . However, extensive research on Ks values of different electron donors 
is required to be able to leverage this model with different electron donors. 
Conclusion  
In summary based on the model at low substrate half saturation constant (K s) and/or low anoxic 
F/M ratio the rate of nitrite reduction to nitrogen gas is greater than the rate of nitrate reduction 
to nitrite and is greater than the sequestration rate. Therefore, insignificant nitrite accumulation 
will be observed. At high substrate half saturation constant (K s) and/or high anoxic F/M ratio or 
feast-famine condition, the rate of substrate sequestration was greater or equal to the rate of 
nitrate reduction to nitrogen gas, therefore different degree of nitrite accumulation is expecte d. 
This study evaluates  the degree of nitrite accumulation using the developed model and bench 
scale data.
