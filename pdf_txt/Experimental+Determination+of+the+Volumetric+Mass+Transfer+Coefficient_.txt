ABSTRACT
The volumetric mass transfer coefficient (kLa) is often used in order to compare the efficiency of bioreactors 
and as an important scale-up factor. In bioreactors, a number of methods are available for estimation the overall 
volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient:  the dynamic method, the steady-state method based on a preliminary 
determination of the oxygen uptake rate, the gaseous oxygen balance, the carbon dioxide balance. Each method 
provides a different estimation of the value of kLa.  We examined the sensitivity of the various methods and compare 
the kLa values obtained in order to select the most suitable method as a function of the type of bioreactor used.  In 
this work we applied dynamic gassing-out method for measuring the volumetric mass transfer coefficient kLa in 
three type gas-liquid reactors (stirred tanks, bubble columns and airlift). Тhe aim of this work is on the basis of our 
experimental data  to obtain several correlations for evaluation of kLa.

INTRODUCTION
Aeration and agitation are important variables to 
provide effective oxygen transfer rate during aerobic  
bioprocesses . Hence , the knowledge of the volumetric 
mass transfer coefficient (kLa) is required. The deter �  The deter �
mination of kLa in a bioreactor is essential in order  to 
establish its aeration efficiency and to quantify the effects 
of operating variables on oxygen supply.
Oxygen transfer in aerobic bioprocesses is essential 
and any shortage of oxygen vastly affects the process 
performance. Therefore, oxygen mass transfer is one 
of the most important phenomena in the design and 
operation of mixing�sparging equipment for bioreactors 
[4]. It can be described and analyzed by means of the 
volumetric mass transfer coefficient, kLa. The values of 
kLa are affected by many factors, such as geometrical and 
operating characteristics of the reactor (type of impeller, 
the geometry of the bioreactor, the agitation speed and 
the air flow rate), media composition and properties, 
concentration and microorganism’s morphology and biocatalyst’s properties [3]. 
In aerated systems the critical limiting factor in pro �
viding the optimal environment is the oxygen transfer 
rate (OTR). The mass balance  for the dissolved oxygen 
in the well�mixed liquid  phase can be written as:
2()L
LLLOdCk a C C r OTR OURdt∗= −−= −          (1)
When oxygen uptake rate, OUR = 0, the oxygen 
mass balance in the liquid phase can be simplified to:
()L
LLLdCk a C C OTRdt∗= −=           (2)
or 
the oxygen  mass transfer rate can be described as 
proportional  to the concentration gradient . For  aerobic 
fermentation the maximum  value of the concentration 
gradient is limited due to the low  solubility of oxygen . 
Therefore, the maximum mass transfer rate from the gas  
to the liquid i n the bioreactor can be estimated by LLk a .C∗, Journal of Chemical Technology and Metallurgy, 48, 4, 2013

METHODS
 The methods  for measuring the kLa can be classified 
depending  on whether the determination is made  in the

methods) . In  Table 1 are summarized m ethod s for the 
volumetric mass transfer coefficient determinatio n. 
Chemical and biological methods  require a reaction in 
the liquid phase to reduce the  dissolved oxygen (DO)  
concentration to a level below saturation. The most 
often u sed chemical  method is chemical  oxidation, 
and from biological methods  � cellular respiration.  The 
physical methods are based on the measurement of  the 
oxygen concentration in the liquid or in the exhaust 
gas flow during absorption /desorption  process.  The 
methods differ in the procedure of gas interchange , 
in the gas used, and in the model for the  gas�phase 
description  [2].EXPERIMENTAL  
The kLa was determined by physical dynamic 
method as described by Benyahia and Jones [14]. The 
activated sludge liquid was deoxygenated by stripping 
with nitrogen. Then, nitrogen was replaced by air, and 
the dissolved oxygen concentration in the liquid was 
measured until equilibrium was reached. The air flow 
was uninterrupted during the switch from nitrogen to 
air so that the consistent fluid dynamic conditions were 
maintained in the reactor throughout the experiment.

integration of equation with CL= 0  at t = 0 gives:

a fast response of oxygen electrode to a change in the

used to conduct experiments for kLa determination using 
of a dynamic gassing�out method.

made with 3 different bubble columns. The first one –

are given in Table 3. 
In all experiments as a gas phase was used a ir and 
desalted water and tylozin as  a liquid phase . The oxygen 
concentration is followed with a P2 – type dissolved 
oxygen probe and a 703P polarographic oxygen meter 
from Uniprobe.  The probe was located at 300 mm from 
the bottom of the column at a n  angle of 450.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The experiments were carried out  in STR  at 300 rpm 
stirring speed  and gas phase flow rate 0.25  l/s. The value 
of  kLa = 0.076 s�1 was obtained by comparison of the 
numerical results from model solution and the experi �
mental data for dissolved oxygen concentration [15] . It 
is obvious that the values of kLa  are not so sensible to 
the variation of the input air flow rate  in comparison 
with variation of the agitation speed, especially in large 
reactors . Experimentally  obtained values  of  kLa  in bub�  in bub� in bub �
ble column with work volume 1000 l and 35 l are 0,069  
s�1 and 0,066  s�1, respectively [16].
In Table 3 are presented experimentally obtained 
correlations for evaluation of  kLa.
CONCLUSIONS
The most suitable method selecti оn for kLa meas �
urement requires to take into account the range of 
the variables as power input, volume and type of the 
reactor, characteristics of gas and liquid phase. T he 
dynamic oxygen method is the most  widely  used, with 
a small degree of approximations for gas–liquid  mixing 
in the reactor . This method is  suitable for large scale 
bioreactors  with errors less than 10  %, over the entire 
range of the  operating conditions encountered in the 
industrial fermentor operation s.
The steady state sulfite method is not recommended 
as it gives inaccurate values in compar ison with the 
other methods applied in industrial scale . The use of 
pure oxygen for accurate estimation  of the volumetric 
mass transfer coefficient is highly uneconomical  when 
other methods are available with a sufficient degree of  
accuracy.
The response methods are also found to be satisfactory  
when applied to stirred vessels. Their applicability for me� heir applicability for me�  for me �
dia with high viscosity and non� coalescing fermentation media  have to  be tested. 
On the base of our experimental data empirical cor �
relations were developed for calculation of kLa values. It 
was found that the predicted kLa values were sufficiently 
well comparable with the observed, especially in small 
scale stirred tank reactors.
