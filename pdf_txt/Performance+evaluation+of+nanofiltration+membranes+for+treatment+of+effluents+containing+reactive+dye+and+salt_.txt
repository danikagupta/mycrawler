THE EFFECTS OF STRUCTURAL AND ELECTRICAL
PROPERTIES OF HOLLOW FIBER NANOFILTRATION
MEMBRANES ON SALT AND DYE REMOVAL UNDER
DIFFERENT SOLUTION PROPERTIES
AHMAD FAUZI ISMAIL1* & LAU WOEI JYE2
Abstract. Three different characteristics of self-made hollow fiber nanofiltration (NF) membranes
with different structural and electrical properties were evaluated for their suitability for removing
salt and colour under different solution properties. Results showed NF achieved promising dyeretention for the reactive dyes used at different concentrations and varied slightly with pH. The
retention of salt was found to be dependent on solution properties and membrane electrical properties
where higher retentions were achieved under alkaline condition and by using NF membrane withhigher surface charge value. The greater membrane negative surface charge properties has also
made the membrane less fouling-sensitive to dye absorption and improving the economic viability
of the treatment process.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
Recently, the development of nanofiltration (NF) membranes for various industrial
applications has drawn much attention from membrane scientists due to their uniquecharacteristics in the separation of small neutral and charged molecules in aqueous
solution. Although a number of studies has been documented in literature to
investigate the separation performance of NF membrane in the treatment of textiledischarge, rare work has been done to study the influence of NF specific characteristics

on solute separation under various feed conditions [1 - 6]. Membrane characteristics
such as pore radius and effective charge density are preferentially required in the
membrane selection so that one would fully explore how these properties take placein the removal of dyestuffs and dissolved salts from wastewater [7]. However,
information on membrane properties specified by manufacturer is not really explicit
as molecular weight cut off and solute separation efficiency of membrane may bevaried depending upon the protocols used by various manufacturers [8]. Moreover,
it is also lack of data about the quantification of membrane surface charge. Only NF
membranes with either negatively charged or positively charged are being disclosedwithout taking into consideration the value of effective surface charge density, X
d.
Bowen and Wahab [7] reported that a high value of Xd could maximize the Donnan
effects of membrane which resulted in effective removal of dye and salt from a dye-salt-water waste stream. Besides the effect of charge density on retention characteristics,
membrane surface charge is also an important parameter to minimize fouling tendency
by reducing the absorption of negatively charged foulants in the feed water [9]. Dueto this, NF membrane with known pore size and effective charge density is required
in solute separation applications in order to obtain precise control of separation
efficiency and achieve purification goal.
Over the past few years, Ismail and Hassan succeed to deduce the fine structural
and electrical properties of NF membranes prepared from different preparation
conditions by employing theoretical models [10 - 12]. By having these properties, itbecomes possible for potential users to choose NF membrane which is best suited to
particular process requirement. Despite membrane properties are always identified
as the primary factors affecting the separation efficiency for the solution containingdye-salt-water components, it is also of great importance to investigate the influences
of solution properties because the efficiency of NF separation is found to be greatly
dependent on the feed water chemistry [13 - 16].
The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of structural and electrical
properties of NF membranes on salt and dye removal under different solution
properties. The differences in the properties of NF were altered by varying thesulfonated poly (ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) content in the dope solution during
membrane fabrication. To evaluate membrane separation efficiency, the feed solutions
were prepared by varying salt concentration, dye concentration, feed pH and etc.The study is expected to provide instructive information on the influences of
membrane characteristics and feed properties on the separation performance.
2.0 MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Materials
Reactive Black 5, RB 5 (MW 991, 
λmax: 592 nm) and Reactive Orange 16, RO 16
(MW 616, λmax: 493 nm), supplied by Sigma were used as received. Charged solutes,THE EFFECTS OF STRUCTURAL AND ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES 105
NaCl and Na2SO4 used in determination of membrane separation efficiency, were
purchased from Merck. NaOH (0.1 N) and HCl (0.1 N) aqueous solution from
Merck were used to modify pH value of feed solution. Other chemicals used in thisstudy were used as purchased without further purification. All the solutions were
prepared using distilled water with pH value nearly 7 unless otherwise specified.
2.2 Nanofiltration Membrane
The self-made NF membranes used in this study were prepared using a simple dry-
jet wet spinning technique [17]. Dope solutions were prepared from 20 wt% PES in
70 wt% NMP which containing different concentrations of PVP K15 and SPEEK.The concentration of SPEEK was varied from zero to 4 wt% in the dope solution in
order to produce different membrane properties, as shown in Table 1. These values
are found in the range of twenty-nine commercial NF membranes assessed by Bowenand Mohammad [7].

2.3 Experimental System
Filtration experiments were conducted using a laboratory-scale cross-flow permeation
system. Both ends of the hollow fiber were plotted with epoxy resin (E-30CL Loctite®Corporation, USA) and then mounted into a test module. A low pressure booster
pump (((((ROP-BP/KF, Kemflo) was used to control the desired operating pressure
(5 bar) through the adjustment of the back-pressure regulator. Feed was pressurizedonto the outer membrane surface into lumen side and permeate was then collected
at the end of the module.
2.4 Analytical Methods
The percentage of dye retention was determined using spectrophotometer (Model
DR/4000, Hach) at a wavelength as specified by manufacturer. Salt concentration in
the feed and in the permeate were analyzed by conductivity using a portableAHMAD FAUZI ISMAIL & LAU WOEI JYE 106
conductivity meter (EC300, YSI Inc). pH meter (HI 8424, HANNA instruments)
was used to measure the pH value of aqueous solution prepared. For the determination
of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) rejection, total organic carbon (TOC) analysis wasperformed using TOC-V
CSH/CSN analyzer (Shimadzu, Japan). The chemical oxygen
demand (COD) analysis was carried out following the procedure handbook of
DR/4000 spectrophotometer.
3.0 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
3.1 Salt Rejection
3.1.1 Effect of Salt Concentration
NaCl and Na2SO4 are the most common inorganic salts that have been widely used
in dyeing process for the purpose of enhancing the degree of dye fixation onto
fabric. The dissolved salt in waste stream must be treated properly before beingdischarged into environment. Figure 1 shows the salt rejection of different
characteristics of NF at salt concentration in the range of 250-5000 ppm. As can be
seen from the figure, PES/SPEEK 4 membrane showed the highest values while PESmembrane the lowest in the separation of NaCl and Na
2SO4 solute. With the addition
of small amount of SPEEK into PES membrane, it showed that both PES/SPEEK
blend membranes displayed higher salt separation than that of PES membrane. It isbecause of the enhancement in membrane surface charge properties resulting from
SPEEK added. Increase in surface charge properties, however resulted in larger
variation in NaCl separation in PES/SPEEK membrane compared to PES membrane.This observation was similar to the work carried out by Van der Bruggen et al. [4],

where salt concentration plays an important role in damping out electrostatic repulsion,
causing electrolyte retention decreases significantly with concentration.
3.1.2 Effect of PH Value
It has been acknowledged that alkaline environment is always the best condition forenhancing the degree of dye fixation during dyeing process, though acidic condition
would also be considered for certain textile operations. Figure 2 presents the effectof feed pH on the rejections of NaCl and Na
2SO4. Higher rejection rates were found
in the case of PES/SPEEK membranes which were claimed to have SO3– ions on the

membrane surface resulting from the addition of SPEEK. The blend membranes
become more negatively charged in alkaline condition due to the presence of more
OH– ions in solutions [18-19]. This leads to an enhancement in electrostatic repulsion
in the interface of membrane with aqueous salt solution and result in higher retention.
However, decreasing the pH from 8.5 to 4 decreased the salt rejection of all the
membranes, indicating pH had an effect on the charge of membrane due to thedisassociation of functional groups. The H
+ ions dissociated from HCl can be absorbed
onto membrane surface, shielding the negative charges and consequently causes
significantly decrease in rejection of electrolytes. Meanwhile, with the use of HClsolution to modify the feed pH, it causes an increase of Cl
– ions in permeate which
may further decrease the rejection rate. Therefore, the salt rejection varied depending
on the feed properties and membrane electrical properties. In general, the use of themost negatively charged NF membrane is highly recommended under alkaline
solution as higher separation efficiency can be easily achieved.
3.2 Dye Removal
3.2.1 Effect of Dye Concentration
Table 2 shows the effect of reactive dye concentration on colour removal using
different characteristics of NF. Reactive dyes are selected for the investigation becausethey are classified as the dyestuffs which have the lowest fixation rate in dyeing
operation. Results from Table 2 indicate that almost complete rejection of RB 5 and
93.7 – 99.5% rejection of RO 16 were achieved depending on type of NF and dyeconcentration used. The major factor affecting the excellent colour removal seems
to be the sieving effect (membrane pore size). As the effective hydrodynamic radius
of dye molecule is typically larger than the membrane pore radius, the retention ofdye is therefore mainly controlled by sieving mechanism. It is reported that the dye
molecule size for RB 5 and RO 16 are approximately 2 nm and 1.5 nm, respectively

[20]. Thus, it is less possible for dye molecules from passage through the membranes
which have relatively smaller pore size (see Table 1). On the other hand, Jiraratananon
et al. [21] reported that Donnan exclusion effect should also be taken into consideration
during dye separation. The effect however was found little dependence in this study,
most probably due to the large size of dye molecules relatively to the membrane
pore size. Nevertheless, it is believed that Donnan exclusion mechanism may takeplace in separation when reactive dye used has the effective hydrodynamic radius
which is relatively equal or even smaller than the membrane pore radius.
3.2.2 Effect of PH Value
Figure 3 details the reactive dye retention of membranes at different pH of dyeingaqueous solutions. As can be clearly seen, the variation of pH values did not affect

significantly the dye retention [22]. No large discrepancies were observed between
the values obtained under different pH conditions using either PES or PES/SPEEK
blend membranes. However, one can note that the values obtained by PES/SPEEKmembranes with solution pH 8 were slightly higher than those obtained with solution
pH 4. This could be partly due to the enhancement in electrical properties of PES/
SPEEK membranes as discussed in salt rejection. Overall, it is found that dye retentionwas still strongly dependent on membrane structural properties rather than electrostatic
properties.
3.3 Experiments with Synthetic Dyeing Wastewater
For this experiment, a synthetic dyeing wastewater composed of 1000 ppm RB 5,
500 ppm PVA, 250 ppm NaCl and 750 ppm Na
2SO4 was prepared and used for the
evaluation of the membrane separation efficiency. The composition of the syntheticwastewater prepared was very similar to the composition of real dyeing wastewater,
making the separation process more practical [6]. The permeate quality was monitored
by measuring the removal efficiency of conductivity, colour, TOC and COD retention.It is observed from Table 3 that the retention of colour, TOC and COD was not
affected by the types of NF used, except the salt retention. The increasing salt retention
in PES/SPEEK membranes is the result of the increasing surface charge properties.As shown in Figure 4, the use of SPEEK on membrane has a great influence on
decreasing flux decline, though the cake layer due to deposited dye molecules is
formed on all the membrane surfaces. Figure 5 shows the FESEM images of outersurface of PES membrane with and without the addition of SPEEK after a simple
chemical cleaning process. Clearly, the PES/SPEEK blend membrane was less stained
with dye compared to PES membrane, indicating fouling on PES/SPEEK blendmembrane was primarily cake formation (reversible) without permanent particle
penetration and pore blockage of the membrane itself. Approximately 85% of water
flux recovery could be retrieved using PES/SPEEK membranes compared to 78% byPES membrane. These results suggested that NF membrane was less fouling-sensitive
to dye adsorption with the addition of small amounts of SPEEK into dope solution
during membrane preparation.

4.0 CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrates the importance of NF characteristics and the feed properties
on the NF separation performance. The salt retention was found to be decreasedwith salt concentration but increased with pH. The surface charge introduced by
SPEEK on PES/SPEEK membranes fully explained the better separation performances
compared to PES membrane. Since membrane pore size was relatively smaller thanthe effective hydrodynamic radius of reactive dye used, notably high retention could
be easily achieved and the dye retention seemed to be not affected by dye
concentration and pH. Membrane fouling is inevitable for dyeing treatment process,however it is reversible with the addition of small amount of SPEEK into membrane.
This is in fact helpful in extending membrane lifespan and improving the economics
of the process.
