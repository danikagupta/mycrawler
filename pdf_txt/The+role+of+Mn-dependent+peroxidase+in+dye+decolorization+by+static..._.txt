Abstract
Resupinate white rot fungi were isolated from across Thailand (seven provinces) and evaluated for 
their ability to degrade the recalcitrant and toxic dye reactive black 5 (RB5). Seven of the 13 isolates decolorized RB5 (100 mg/L) within three days (greater than 50%). One isolate, Phanerochaete sordida  
PBU 0057, yielded complete decoloration within three days. It was active under environmental conditions in which waste dyes are discharged. The degradation of RB5 by P . sordida  PBU 0057 was con ﬁ rmed by 
spectrophotometric and HPLC analyses. The degradation was associated with the activities of laccase and lignin peroxidase. Manganese peroxidase was additionally active in the comparative control strain of P . chrysosporium . The degradation dye products produced by P . sordida  PBU 0057 were not phytotoxic towards 
Phaseolus vulgaris , Sorghum bipolar, and Zea mays . Overall, P . sordida  PBU 0057 showed somewhat greater 
dye-degradative activities when compared to the control reference strain P . chrysosporium  ATCC 24725 
under practical environmental conditions.  P . sordida  PBU 0057 has potential for application in the biological 
detoxi ﬁ cation treatment of waste dye residues.

Introduction
Synthetic dyes are in wide use by textile, paper, 
cosmetics, food, and pharmaceutical industries due to their low cost, their range of shades and brilliant colors, and practical properties including water solubility and high stability [1, 2]. More than 10,000 synthetic dyes are in common use totaling around 700,000 metric tons annual production [3]. Unfortunately the most common group, the azo-dyes, can be toxic to plants and carcinogenic in animals [4]. The health safety issues are ampli ﬁ ed as their 
breakdown products include mutagenic sulfonates and amines [5, 6]. The discharge of such waste colorants into the environment poses serious pollution risks. 
The structures and compositions of azo dye waste 
depends on the dyeing process
 [7]. Almost 20-50% of 
the dyes can be lost during the dyeing process, thus resulting in dye residue concentrations of up to 100-200 mg/L in wastewaters [7]. In tropical countries, the discharge ef ﬂ uents can be warm (up to 30ºC) and are 
usually neutral to alkaline [8]. To alleviate environmental health and toxicity concerns, dye processing wastewaters require treatment systems that ef ﬁ ciently remove the 
toxic residues, which are functional in relatively broad environmental conditions [7, 8]. The reduction of azo dye waste levels has been achieved by physicochemical approaches, including ﬂ otation, ozonation, and adsorption 
[4, 7, 8]. Microbial degradation systems are a further efﬁ cient and eco-friendly option [8-11].
Among biological dye treatments, the use of white rot 
fungi offers one of the most promising approaches based on the degradative action of their extracellular lignin-modifying enzymes (LMEs), including lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidases, and laccase [9-12]. These enzymes can lead to complete mineralization of aromatic recalcitrant structures [8, 12, 13]. Furthermore, white rot fungi can tolerate a broad range of environmental conditions including high concentrations of toxic compounds, low pH, and higher temperature [10, 11], making their potential application for wastewater treatment more attractive and practical.
Resupinate white rot fungi belong to the 
Aphyllophorales, or non-gilled mushrooms that have a ﬂ attened fruiting body adpressed to the substrate [14, 15]. 
Though similar in gross morphology, they have diverse anatomical, physiological, and molecular biological characteristics
 [15]. Phanerochaete chrysosporium  is 
the most extensively studied white rot fungus due to its efﬁ ciency in attacking a range of condensed aromatic 
pollutants and lignin [16-19]. Broader studies of this resupinate group address their biodegradative capabilities [10], and speci ﬁ c focus has centered on Dichomitus 
squalens , Irpex lacteus , and Bjerkandera adusta  [2, 
20-22]. Resupinate white rots occur widely in tropical countries, including Thailand [23-25],
 and although their 
wood degradation was considered [26], their potential role in bioremediation has yet to be fully addressed.
This study addresses the decoloration capability of Thai 
resupinate fungi acting toward the most commonly used commercial azo dye, reactive black 5 (RB5). Resupinate 
fungi were isolated from seven Thai provinces. They were identi ﬁ ed and screened for their production of LMEs and 
capability to decolorize RB5. The most ef ﬁ cient was an 
isolate of Phanerochaete sordida . It was compared with 
the white rot model species P . chrysosporium [13, 16]. 
The decomposition of RB5 was evaluated under a range of physicochemical parameters. The biodegradation products were assessed using spectrophotometry and HPLC, and their toxicity was determined by phytotoxicity testing.
Materials and Methods
Fungal Cultures 
Thirteen isolates of Thai resupinate fungi (Table 1) 
were isolated from naturally occurring fructi ﬁ cations 
through plating on selective media of 2% malt extract agar (MEA; Becton-Dickinson, USA) supplemented with the restrictors rose bengal (100 ppm, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and benomyl (100 ppm, Benlate, E.I. Dupont Nemours, Inc., USA). The medium was autoclaved at 121ºC for 15 min and cooled to 50ºC prior to adding sterile ﬁ ltration 
of chloramphenicol solution (100 ppm, Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Cultures were maintained on malt extract agar (1.5% w/v), stored at 4ºC, and subcultured monthly. They were deposited in the culture collection of the Plant Bio-mass Utilization Research Unit, Chulalongkorn Univer-sity (PBU). Phanerochaete chrysosporium ATCC 24725, 
the model for lignin degradation studies, was used as a comparative reference culture.
Fungal Identi ﬁ cation 
Resupinate fungi were identi ﬁ ed based on morphology 
and con ﬁ rmed by their internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 
sequences.  
Morphological Identi ﬁ cation
 
Macroscopic morphological details of fresh 
specimens such as color, texture, and shape were recorded. Microscopic characteristics were observed from rehydrated sections of fruiting body mounted in KOH (5%) and stained with phloxine (1%), cotton blue, sulphoaldehyde, and Melzer’s reagent [27]. The general morphology and detailed anatomical features of speci ﬁ c 
elements included basidiospores, hyphae, cystedia, and the organization of the fruiting bodies used for identi ﬁ cation 
included hymenium surface, shape of the basidia, and cystedia [27].
ITS Sequencing
To determine ITS sequences the cultures were grown 
on top of cellophane placed on 1.5% MEA and harvested after seven days of culture. Genomic DNA was isolated by standard phenol-chloroform extraction [28]. Polymerase 1169 Biological Treatment of Reactive...
chain reactions were performed using IT S4 and ITS5 [29] 
and sent for sequencing (GENEWIZ DNA sequencing service, NJ). Each ITS sequence was assembled and analyzed using the DNAStar sequence analysis software (Lasergene) prior to submission to BLASTn search for comparison to those in the GenBank.
Screening of Lignin-Modifying Enzyme Pro ﬁ les 
in Agar Plates
Lignin-modifying enzyme (LMEs) production was 
evaluated on LME basal medium (LMB) supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) glucose and solidi ﬁ ed with 1.6% (w/v) 
agar [30]. Speci ﬁ c substrates included 2,2 ′-azino-bis 
(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS; Sigma-Aldrich, USA), azure-B (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) or phe-nol red (Sigma-Aldrich, USA)). Actively growing myce-lial discs were used to inoculate the assay media in Petri dishes. ABTS (0.1%) medium was used to detect laccase [31]. Formation of a green halo of oxidized ABTS around the fungal colony illustrated laccase production. Phenol red (0.1%) medium was used to detect the ability to pro-duce manganese peroxidase [32]. Change of phenol red color from yellow to red indicated the production of Mn
3+. 
Changes in the intensity of discoloration were recorded as three categories, namely yellow (+), orange (++) , and 
red (+++). Azure B (0.01%) plates were used to detect lig-nin peroxidase production [33]. Decoloration of azure B 
(0.01%) – indicating a clear halo – was monitored daily. All plate assays were carried out at 30ºC and in triplicate.
Screening for RB5 Decoloration in Solid 
and Liquid Media
For screening of RB5-decolorizing activity, mycelial 
discs (8 mm diam) were inoculated onto MEA containing RB5 (100 mg/L, Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The cultures were visually monitored daily for decoloration of the medium by the change from dark blue of RB5 to the slight yellow of MEA. Strains that decolorized the RB5 thoroughly on solid MEA within 5 days were subsequently tested for the ability to decolorize RB5 in liquid medium (modi ﬁ ed 
malt extract broth) [34]. Two agar discs (8 mm diam) from the periphery of a ﬁ ve-day-old MEA colony were 
used to inoculate modi ﬁ ed malt extract broth (100 ml/ 
250-ml Erlenmeyer ﬂ ask), with incubation at 30ºC under 
static conditions for three days. RB5 was sterilized by ﬁ ltration (0.22- μm; Millipore, Bedford, MA) and added 
to the culture at a ﬁ nal concentration of 100 mg/L, with 
the pH adjusted to pH 7. Incubation was continued with agitation at 150 rpm. Mycelia in the culture were separated by ﬁ ltration through ﬁ lter paper (Whatman No.1) and 
extracted with ethanol-water (1:1) for 1 h to desorb the dye [34]. The absorbance of residual RB5 was monitored Table 1. Thai resupinate fungal isolates and their decoloration of RB5 dye.

at 597 nm using a Spectrophotometer (Unico, Specord 
2000, Jena, Germany). All experiments were carried out in triplicate. Decoloration (%) was based on:
Decoloration (%) = [(Initial Absorbance – Final 
Absorbance)/ Initial Absorbance] x 100
…where Final Absorbance = (Mycelial free supernatant – 
Mycelial desorbed solution).
Effect of the Physicochemical Parameters 
for RB5 Decoloration
The most ef ﬁ cient decolorizing isolate, P . sordida  
PBU 0057, was further evaluated in comparison to the reference strain P . chrysosporium.  In relation to the effect 
of physicochemical parameters, the effects of pH (6, 7, and 8), temperature (25, 30, and 35ºC), agitation (0 and 150 rpm), and RB5 concentration (100 and 200 mg/L) were tested. Biotic and abiotic controls were carried out in parallel. The biotic controls included culture medium inoculated with fungus without dye; abiotic controls were culture medium supplemented with dye but lacking the fungus. The percentage of RB5 decoloration was monitored. 
Lignin-Modifying Enzyme Assays
Lignin-modifying enzyme  (LME) activities were 
determined spectrophotometrically using crude culture supernatant. Laccase activity was determined using ABTS as the substrate. The oxidation of ABTS was monitored at 30ºC by measuring the increase in A
420 
(ε = 36.0 mM–1 cm–1). One U of laccase activity was 
deﬁ ned as the amount of enzyme required to oxidize 
1 μmol of ABTS per minute [31]. Lignin peroxidase 
activity was measured by monitoring the oxidation of veratryl alcohol (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) to veratraldehyde at 310 nm. One unit (U) of lignin peroxidase was de ﬁ ned 
as the amount of enzyme forming 1 μmol veratraldehyde 
per minute ( ε = 9.3 mM
–1 cm1) [19]. Manganese peroxidase 
activity was measured by monitoring the oxidation of 2, 6-dimethoxyphenol (2, 6 DMP; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at 469 nm ( ε = 27.5 mM
−1 cm−1). One U of manganese 
peroxidase activity was de ﬁ ned as the amount of enzyme 
required to oxidize 1 μmol of DMP per minute [35]. 
Spectrophotometric and HPLC Assays
Degradation of the dye was monitored spectrophoto-
metrically from 400 to 700 nm [26], and by HPLC analy-sis
 [36]. The decolorized dye products were assessed by 
comparison of spectrophotometric peaks every 24 hours to those of RB5 (control). A progressive reduction in ab-sorbance with time and lack of formation of new peaks indicated dye decoloration through cleavage of the chro-mophoric dye structure. HPLC analysis [36] of the decol-orized dye products was performed using decolorized cul-ture supernatants (initially 200 mg/L RB5). The absence of a major dye peak and/or presence of new peaks at different 
retention times illustrated dye degradation [21]. The de-colorized dye products were extracted from culture ﬂ uids 
(control and experimental samples) in methylene chloride [21, 36] passed over anhydrous sodium sulfate to remove water and evaporated to dryness in a rotary evaporator. The dried material was dissolved in 5 ml 100% methanol and subjected to HPLC (Lichospher, Germany) analysis on a reverse-phase C18 column (RP-C18 Phenomenex; 5 mm, 4.6 μm x 250 mm) at 35ºC. The samples (100 μl 
loading) were analyzed using a gradient with 0.025 M phosphate buffer (pH 3) and acetonitrile as the mobile phase from 10-90%
 [36]. The peaks were detected using 
a photo-diode detector at 254 nm. The analyses were car-ried out in duplicate. 
Toxicity Test
Phytotoxicity of the RB5 degradation products was as-
sessed using azo dye-sensitive plants [5, 37]. Pesticide-free seeds, including sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor  Linn.), 
corn ( Zea mays  Linn.), and red kidney bean ( Phaseo-
lus vulgaris  Linn.) were used. They were germinated in 
the presence of potential inhibitors at room temperature (28±2ºC) under a 12-hours light/12-hours dark cycle, and their percentage germination, shoot length, and root length were measured
 after incubation for seven days [38, 
39].  Five replicates of three sets of samples were con-
ducted, including one soaked with water, the second with RB5 (200 mg/L), and the third with biodegraded RB5 (200 mg/L). 
Results and Discussion
Collection and Isolation of Resupinate 
White Rot Fungi
In the general isolation, resupinate fruiting bodies on 
wood were selected and 13 isolates were recovered (Table 1). The selection was from seven Thai provinces yielding an experimental group of isolates from across the country. Isolates represented seven genera, there being multiple isolates of Phanerochaete.  This broad range of isolates 
was considered a practical representative group for the dye degradation studies. The LMEs associated with the degradation of the azo dyes were recorded. Twelve and 11 isolates were positive for laccase and manganese peroxidase activities, respectively, while only eight isolates produced lignin peroxidase (Table 1). 
Screening for Lignin-Modifying Enzymes 
The screening results revealed that lignin peroxidases, 
which is rarely found in typical white rot fungi [13], was relatively common among these resupinate fungi. Manganese peroxidase and laccase have previously been linked directly to the degradation of aromatic compounds, including decoloration of synthetic dyes by white rot 1171 Biological Treatment of Reactive...
fungi [2, 11, 18, 26]. However, dyes containing highly 
recalcitrant structures could limit the decoloration ability of the fungus since they require higher redox potential of a catalyst to initiate electron distribution in a degradation mechanism [6, 16, 17]. The Lignin peroxidase has the highest redox potential and facilitates attack of both phenolic and non-phenolic structures of recalcitrant compounds, including diazo, triazo, anthraquinone, and triphenylmethane dye structures [17]. 
Screening for Ef ﬁ cient RB5-Degrading Fungi
Isolates of white rot fungi can degrade azo dyes, 
including Bjerkandera adusta [2], Dichomitus squalens 
[20], Irpex lacteus [22], P. chrysosporium  [1], and  
Pleurotus  spp. [26, 36]. The current isolates were screened 
for such potential decolorizing activity toward RB5 b y  m o n i t o r i n g  t h e  c o n v e r s i o n  o f  t h e  d a r k  b l u e  R B 5  (100 mg/L) to light yellow products (Table 1).

0051, Phanerochaete sordida  PBU 0057, Phanerochaete  
spp. PBU 0056, PBU 0058, and PBU 0059. However, different species of the same genus could be either 
positive (Macrohyporia dictyopora  PBU 0051) or 
negative ( Macrohyporia sp. PBU 0052) degraders (Table 
1). Decoloration by  J. crustacea , M. dictyopora , and P.  
tephropora  appear as newly reported activities. 
The seven positive cultures were further evaluated 
in liquid medium (100 mg/L RB5). Decoloration ranged from 43-100% within three days (Table 1). Of these seven isolates, P . sordida  PBU 0057 had the greatest 
decolorizing ability. It was slightly more active than the reference P . chrysosporium  ATCC 24725) yielding 
complete decoloration (100 mg/L of RB5 in liquid media) within three days of incubation. Adsorption of the dye color into the mycelium was observed in ﬁ ve isolates out 
of the seven tested fungi, except P . sordida  PBU 0057 
and I. lacteus  PBU 0049. The bioadsorption usually 
occurred at the early stage of the decoloration, resulting in the fast removal of the dye from the culture broth. Dye removal by this mechanism can be temporary since dye residues can be released through hyphal degradation [6, 10]. Some white rot fungi, such as Bjerkandera adusta , 
could further completely biodegrade the dye inside or outside their mycelia [9]. In the current study, P . sordida

1172 Permpornsakul P ., et al.
PBU 0057 and I. lacteus  PBU 0049 ef ﬁ ciently deco-
lorized the dye without evidence of the dye being taken up by the mycelia. Since the decolorizing ability of P . sordida  
PBU 0057 toward RB5 was the greatest among the new isolates and occurred without adsorption, it was selected for further evaluation. Its ef ﬁ cacy was evaluated under 
varied physicochemical parameters (pH, temperature, agitation, and RB5 concentration) with comparative studies to the reference P . chrysosporium  ATCC 24725 .
Effects of Physicochemical Culture Conditions 
on P . sordida PBU 0057
Effects of pH on Decoloration 
With regard to RB5 decoloration, this azo dye 
wastewater is usually neutral to alkaline [3, 7]. However, though fungi grow optimally under weakly acidic conditions, the azo dyes were degraded even in a slightly alkaline pH range (pH 7 to 8; Fig. 1). P . sordida  PBU 
0057 yielded 100% decoloration in 72 hours over the pH range (pH 6-8; Fig. 1a), while P . chrysosporium  reached 
the maximum (96%) by 96 hours, though lesser (93%) at pH 8 (Fig. 1b). The Effect of Temperature on Decoloration 
The effect of temperature on decoloration was 
assessed at 25, 30, and 35ºC (Figs 2 a, b). Complete RB5 decoloration by P . sordida  PBU 0057 occurred by 72 hours 
at 30 and 35ºC, but was delayed until 96 hours at 25ºC (Fig. 2a). Overall, the tropical isolates have the advantage of being active at higher temperatures – a practical attribute in tropical wastewater treatment facilities
 [21, 26]. 
The Effects of Aeration on Decoloration 
Although agitation is probably not practical on a 
commercial scale such as a holding pond, it might re ﬂ ect 
agitation. The effect of aeration on decoloration was addressed by cultures grown with and without agitation (0 or 150 rpm). The decoloration of RB5 by both P.  
sordida  PBU 0057 (100%) and P . chrysosporium  (97%) 
was effective in still and shake culture (Figs 3 a, b). Comparatively, the ef ﬁ ciency of RB5 decoloration by 
Pleurotus eryngii  F032 [26] was enhanced by agitation 
while it retarded the activity of P . chrysosporium  and 
I. lacteus  [40, 41]. A more detailed study of the effects of 
aeration appears to be appropriate with the current strains.

The Effect of Initial Dye Concentration 
on Decoloration
Dye concentration was addressed. P . sordida  PBU 
0057 completely decolorized RB5 (100 mg/L) by 72 hours and it was slightly slower at the higher concentration (200 mg/L) (Fig. 4a).  P . chrysosporium  was effective at 
the same concentrations (Fig. 4b). The concentrations of azo dyes in waste ef ﬂ uents are in the range of 50 to 
200 mg/L
 [11], and thus both strains are effective in these 
practical ranges. 
Decoloration Rate at 80% Decoloration (T80) 
of RB5
The decoloration ef ﬁ cacy of each treatment was 
compared on a basis of the time required for 80% decoloration (T80). The hours at T80 were calculated from polynomial regression equations from Figs 1-4 (Table 4). At T80, the decoloration rate of P . sordida  PBU 0057 was 
found to be faster than P . chrysosporium  at all pHs, 30ºC, 
35ºC, with agitation and at 100 mg/l of RB5 (Table 4). The results suggested that pH, temperature, agitation, and dye concentration had effects upon the rate of decoloration of both strains at T80.
        
Activity of Lignin-Modifying Enzymes 
during Decoloration
On growth in the presence of RB5, laccase and lignin 
peroxidase were detected in the culture ﬂ uid of P . sordida  
PBU 0057 (Table 2), while manganese peroxidase was additionally found during the culture of P . chrysosporium . 
Over four days of culture, laccase activity by P . sordida  
PBU 0057 increased gradually, and this was paralleled by manganese peroxidase and laccase activities of P.  
chrysosporium . In contrast, lignin peroxidase of both 
fungi was only detected early on with maximum levels on day 2 (Table 2). For P . sordida  PBU 0057, only laccase 
activity appeared to correlate with decoloration, but the potential enhancement of decoloration may involve lignin peroxidase in providing the variety of intermediates which are further metabolized by laccase or manganese 
peroxidase [17]. During the RB5 decoloration, lignin peroxidase activity could be detected only in the early period of culture, whereas laccase activity correlated with decoloration (Table 4). Lignin peroxidase and laccase have been linked to the decoloration of azo dyes by white rot fungi [26], but the decoloration of RB5 by P . sordida  PBU 0057 perhaps occurred mainly through 
the activity of laccase. However, such a correlation on its own does not establish the role for laccase, but for the potential enhancing involvement of lignin peroxidase in providing the lignin peroxidase-produced metabolites that were further metabolized by laccase [12, 17]. Overall, an optimal dye decoloration and detoxic ﬁ cation process with 
microbes that produce lignin peroxidase in the aggregate enzyme systems are preferable.
RB5 Degradation
Disruption of the azo dye structure results in loss of 
its color [42]. RB5 has a maximum absorbance at 597 nm (Fig. 5). To verify that RB5 decoloration by P . sordida  
PBU 0057 corresponded with degradation of the dye as quanti ﬁ ed by spectrophotometry and HPLC. The

ﬂ uid containing RB5 showed the 597 nm absorption 
peak that decreased over time and became undetectable after three days (Fig. 5). The complete disappearance of the major peak of RB5 suggested that P . sordida PBU 
0057 has broken the azo bonds. HPLC analysis similarly showed the disappearance of the major RB5 peak (Figs 6 a, b) and the formation of a broad range of different peaks with longer retention times. Degradation of RB5 by P.  
chrysosporium  [40] and of reactive Leva ﬁ x Blue by Irpex 
lacteus [21] has been based on spectrophotometric and 
HPLC analyses. Degradation of RB5 by P . sordida PBU 
0057 is clearly indicated (Figs 5, 6). 
Phytotoxicity of RB5 Degradation Products
Plants are sensitive indicators of remediation by-
products showing either inhibition or stimulation (induction) of plant growth and development [37]. Phytotoxicity of the 
RB5 products from P . sordida  PBU 0057 was assessed by 
analysis of their effect on seed germination and seedling development [5, 37] using three dye-sensitive plants: sorghum, corn, and red kidney bean [5] (Table 3). Seed germination percentages of plants after soaking with the decolorized dye metabolites ranged from 90-100% and showed no signi ﬁ cant difference with the controls 
(seeds soaked in water; 100%) (T able 3). The RB5 
degradation products were not toxic (90-100% germination) in comparison to the original dye (germination over 80, 40, and 65%). Likewise for seedling growth, in terms of shoot and root length, the seeds soaked with the degraded dye products exhibited no growth inhibition of the three plants in contrast to the marked inhibition of seed response when treated directly with the dye (Table 3). An exception was shoot length of Phaseolus 
mungo , which was not signi ﬁ cantly different in all 
treatments. Fig. 6.  HPLC pro ﬁ le of (a) RB5 (200 mg/L) and (b) the degrad-

In overview, the phytotoxicity of RB5 was eliminated 
after treatment with P . sordida  PBU 0057. Fungal 
detoxi ﬁ cation of the azo dyes has been noted, including 
navy blue HER degradation after treatment with Trichosporon beigelii  NCIM-3326, which relieved the 
inhibition of seed germination of P . mungo  and Sorghum 
bicolor [43]. Also, degradation products of azo dye, acid 
red 27 after treatment with Armillaria sp. F022 showed no 
growth inhibition toward S. vulgare  and Triticum aestivum  
[44]. The detoxi ﬁ cation of the recalcitrant azo dyes by 
P . sordida  PBU 0057 can potentially be developed for 
useful detoxi ﬁ cation environmental protocols.
Conclusions
The biological detoxi ﬁ cation of synthetic dye wastes 
by mineralization can potentially be achieved using white rot fungi. Thirteen isolates of resupinate white rot fungi from across Thailand were recovered and their degradative action towards the azo dye, reactive black 5 (RB5), was assessed. Seven isolates from this basidiomycete group were capable of decolorizing the dye. The new strain  
Phanerochaete sordida  PBU 0057 was slightly faster 
and more ef ﬁ cient in its decoloration and detoxi ﬁ cation 
than the reference strain P . chrysosporium  ATCC 24725. 
The decoloration was a result of biodegradation and not due to biosorption. Decoloration occurred under a range of physicochemical conditions re ﬂ ecting practical levels 
in dye wastewater treatment. The lack of phytotoxicity of the biodegradation products from RB5 produced by P.  
sordida PBU 0057 is the most positive ﬁ nding in regard 
to bioremediation potential in treatment of dye wastes. Decoloration reported for the ﬁ rst time of J. crustacea , 
M. dictyopora , and P . tephropora  augurs well for further 
analysis of the relatively unstudied resupinate group to uncover their further capabilities.
