Abstract: Waste valorization is attracting not only the scientiﬁc world but also the world. Acetyl-
cellulose wastes from cigarette ﬁlter residuals are signiﬁed as the largest global impact of solid
waste. Acetylcellulose recycling for desired products is a promising way for environmental man-
agement. In this regard, the current investigation is dealing with the immersion of residual ﬁlters
sequentially into aqueous solutions of alkali and ethanol before water washing, which converts them
into a superhydrophobic acetylcellulose adsorbent material. The morphology and characteristics
of the acetylcellulose ﬁber were characterized using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and
Fourier-Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The adsorption tendency was checked for Levaﬁx
Blue dye compromised in an aqueous stream as a model textile polluted efﬂuent. The experimental
results exposed that the acetylcellulose ﬁber displayed a sensible textile dye elimination from the
dying stream. Langmuir isotherm is well ﬁtting the adsorption matrix and the reaction follows the
1st-order kinetic model. The so-obtained acetylcellulose ﬁber showed tremendous efﬁciency for
dye removal from aqueous efﬂuent. The attained maximum monolayer adsorption capacity was
recorded as 4.8 mg/g at pH 3.0 and an adsorbent dose of 1 g/L through the isotherm time of 2 h.
Also, temperature elevation could increase the adsorption capacity to 5.7 mg/g. Due to this excellent
afﬁnity to adsorb dye at an economic wise rate is shown as a promising candidate for textile dye
elimination form aqueous efﬂuent.

1. Introduction
Since the twentieth century, there has been an ever-increasing alarm for the existence
of solid waste that causes extreme toxicity to the environment [ 1]. To a large extent, the
presence of such waste in the environment is causing ecological damage [ 2]. This necessi-
tates appropriate adequate treatment and management before eliminating their disposal
into the ecosystem. Hence, converting such waste-based materials for new ecologically
benign substances is attaining the scientiﬁc community. In this concept there has been some
very recent but limited progress in the search for greener materials from solid waste [2,3].
Worldwide, the most littered solid waste is signiﬁed as a cigarette ﬁlter [ 4–6]. Trillions
of cigarette ﬁlters are signiﬁed as a hazard solid waste and is deposited per annum. Instead,
97% of such ﬁlters were compromised as a modiﬁed natural polymer that is so-called acetyl-
cellulose ﬁber (ACF) [ 4]. Although this acetylcellulose waste is categorized as undervalued
material, the scientists’ and researchers’ interest is seeking sustainable elucidations for
tackling cigarette ﬁlter pollution concerns [ 5]. Till now, generally, solid waste pollution

management includes landﬁlling incineration, recycling, and degradation [ 7]. Numerous
research works have been conducted to convert cigarette ﬁlter waste into reusable material
for various applications to attain the circular economy concept [ 8]. For instance, it has pre-
viously been applied in the environmental engineering ﬁeld, infrastructures and building
materials, metallurgical engineering, and energy storage devices. However, according to
the research cited [ 9] minimal application of cigarette ﬁlters in environmental engineering,
compared to wide applications in buildings and structure ﬁelds.
An encouraging technique to control the environmental impacts of cigarette ﬁlters is
to convert them into desired products in a circular economy concept. Acetylcellulose [ 10]
which is an economically attractive and usable adsorbent material is the main constituent
of cigarette ﬁlters. Furthermore, acetylcellulose ﬁber (ACF) was previously reported in
the literature [ 11–15] as an excellent substance with great potential for adsorption capacity.
That is a superior substance for the ﬁeld of separation.
The contamination of dyes has developed into a signiﬁcant environmental issue
with the development of the textile industry. Due to their severe toxic effectiveness, and
non-biodegradable and bioaccumulated characteristics, dyes in aqueous media pollution
pose a serious threat to the environmental biosphere and public health [ 16]. Due to the
consumption of massive amounts of water in textile dying processes, an ultimate amount
of wastewater is generated. Such wastewater mainly contains unconsumed dyes and
chemical activities that represent a great environmental concern worldwide [ 17,18]. The
result is a direct threat to the aquatic system when these efﬂuents are not treated before
their ﬁnal disposal [ 6,19–21]. However, the textile discharge is composed of toxic and
stable substances that are difﬁcult to remove. Textile industry discharges pose high loads of
various dyes exhibiting vivid colors and posing signiﬁcant challenges for degradation using
conventional methods. These characteristics result in reduced water transparency, leading
to the obstruction of solar radiation penetration into the ecosystem which is essential for
photosynthetic processes. The result is a massive disturbance to the aquatic creatures [6].
Therefore, for the great signiﬁcance of such aqueous waste, it must undergo treat-
ment and management. Efﬂuent discharged from textile industries is eliminated based
on various techniques including physicochemical treatments such as adsorption [ 20], co-
agulation, sedimentation, and ﬁltration. Also, biological treatments based on activated
sludge are applied [ 21]. Such techniques unfortunately are unfavorable since they generate
a large amount of sludge by-product and are not efﬁcient at destroying or eliminating dye
molecules from aqueous efﬂuent [ 6]. Thus, the appropriate adsorption system offers a
ﬂexible design for efﬁcient and economic operation concerning high superiority to reclaim
water [ 17,20]. However, natural and waste materials have attracted interest as alternatives
to synthetic adsorbents due to economic regard and chemical consumption [6,21–24]. It is
noteworthy to mention that acetylcellulose is signiﬁed as an inert polymer, that is benign
and odor-free. Hence, the recycling of smuggled cigarette ﬁlters for pollutant elimination is
extremely attractive [ 25–28]. Notably, acetylcellulose could be derived from fruit branches
and other naturally occurring substances [ 29–34]. However, using acetylcellulose from
cigarette ﬁlter waste sources is signiﬁcant since its presence in such waste material causes
massive harm to the environment. Acetylcellulose is a photodegradable polymer that
is not easily biodegradable therefore, its occurrence may persist in the environment for
years [32–36].
The uptake of contaminants from aqueous efﬂuents using waste valorized materials is
vital not just for toxicity exclusion, but also for valued waste recovery. The application of
the adsorption technique for the determination of different analyses in different matrices
is a valuable alternative due to the availability of a large range of valuable adsorbents.
Good adsorbent properties that involve high surface area, high removal efﬁciency, and
reusability support them to be good candidates for environmental remediation [ 19,21]. In
this sense, this current investigation aims to prepare an economic adsorbent from the waste
cigarette ﬁlters for the adsorption of reactive dye in an aqueous medium. The capacity of
the material for Levaﬁx blue adsorption and the effects of different parameters, such as theProcesses 2023 ,11, 2701 3 of 17
isotherm time, the aqueous media pH, temperature, adsorbent dose, and dye loading are
investigated. Also, the adsorption kinetics and isotherm models are assessed to evaluate
the adsorption system.
2. Experimental Investigation
2.1. Acetylcellulose Fibers Collection and Preparation
Acetylcellulose ﬁbers derived from cigarette ﬁlters are used as an adsorbent material.
Initially, the cigarette ﬁlters are collected from a Coffee shop station near the University
of Menouﬁa, Egypt before subjection for cleaning and treatment. Initially, the smoked
ﬁlters are de-warped from the covered paper and subjected to successive washing with
distilled water. Then it is ultrasonically cleaned in ethanol alcohol to remove any remaining
impurities. Subsequently, the cleaned ﬁber is removed from the solution by ﬁltration.
Afterward, the samples were subjected to oven drying at 105C to eliminate any moisture
content before their utilization. Then, ACF samples were stored in a dry place at room
temperature for further use.
2.2. Wastewater
Levaﬁx Blue CA is signiﬁed as a kind of reactive dye and was delivered by DyStar
Ltd., (Raunheim, Germany) where the aqueous efﬂuent containing a synthetic textile dye
was employed as a representative model. Levaﬁx Blue dye is a dark blue powder, which is
categorized as a bifunctional and combined anchor. The dye powder was applied for use
with no further puriﬁcation or treatment. The aqueous solution is arranged by preparing a
stock solution of 1000 mg/L of the dye, which was then diluted as needed to the required
concentrations.
2.3. Characterisation Study
The sludge samples that were prepared underwent examination and imaging using a
Field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Quanta FEG 250). Fourier Trans-
form Infrared (FTIR) spectra analysis of acetylcellulose (performed using Jasco, FT/IR-4100,
type A) was conducted to determine the speciﬁc functional groups involved in the adsorp-
tion test. Additionally, the particle size distribution of the acetylcellulose material was
determined using the IMAGEJ 1.48 V program.
2.4. Methodology and Analytical Determination
100-mL of Levaﬁx Blue CA dye-containing wastewater was poured into a glass con-
tainer to investigate the dye loading on its removal efﬁciency. The initial solution of the
aqueous environment’s pH was adjusted, when needed, to the desired values by using di-
luted H 2SO4(1:9) and/or 1.0 M NaOH solutions. The desired pH values were achieved by
utilizing a digital pH meter (Model AD1030, Adwa instrument, Szeged, Hungary) to make
necessary adjustments. Subsequently, ACF-material was added to the wastewater, and the
reaction was conducted for dye reduction. Subsequently, after selected time intervals, sam-
ples were withdrawn periodically and subjected to spectrophotometric analysis after the
samples were ﬁltered using a micro-ﬁlter. Spectrophotometric performances were applied
using Model Unico UV-2100, USA at the maximum absorbance peak of a wavelength of
610 nm which was monitored and applied to evaluate the amount of residual Levaﬁx Blue
CA dye remaining in the aqueous efﬂuent after adsorption.
The schematic representation of the graphical experimental set-up and steps is illus-
trated in Figure 1. Adsorption capacity ( qe) is investigated by using initial (C o) and ﬁnal

3.1. Characterization of the Prepared Fiber 3.1.1. Acetlycellulose SEM Imaging 
The morphological analysis of acetlycellulose fiber, ACF, is conducted by scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM) to examine the morphological changes that occur before and 
after cleaning. Scanning electron micrographs of  fibers prior to and after cleaning are ex-
hibited in Figure 2. Figures 2a,b,d, and e disp lay the slightly organized straight fibers with 
narrow pores on their surfaces of ribbon-shap ed fibers. Notably, after treatment (Figure 
2d,e), the non-cellulosic materials are removed in the treatment process; hence, the values 
for fineness in the treated fibers are increas ed. It was observed that the volume of the 
constituent fibers prior to (Figure 2a–c) and after (Figure 2d,e) treatment declined by the 
cleaning process. Consequently, the surface area of the fibers and the amount of the avail-
able exposed cellulose on the fiber surface are increased which improves the adsorption 
matrix through interfacial bonding. Hence, th is affinity might possess a positive impact 
on the adsorption process. 
Also, the particle size distribution was calculated, The corresponding values are il-
lustrated in Figure 2, specifically in panels (c) and (f) for acetlycellulose fibers prior to and 
after treatment, respectively. The acetlycellul ose fiber diameter distribution exhibited a 
narrow change as illustrated in Figure 2c,f. It is notably exhibited that particle size is lesser in the case after treatment which means more sites are available sinc e the surface area is 
smaller than the untreated acetlycellulose fibers ribbon.

in the case after treatment which means more sites are available since the surface area is

3.1.2. Acetlycellulose FTIR
The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of both acetlycellulose prior to
and after cleaning are investigated and are displayed in Figure 3. As shown in Figure 3,
both curves (a and b) illustrate the bands at 1030, 1327, 1432, and 1756 cm 1appearing
in both ACF samples that reﬂect the presence of various groups. The acetlycellulose
ﬁber exhibited similar band intensities at 1104 cm 1are an indication of the presence of
C-O. Furthermore, the distinctive peak associated with O=C bonding should be placed
at wavenumber 1721 cm 1.The band at 778 cm 1corresponds to the CH bending mode,
which appears in the cleaned sample. The newly formed bonds of CH, C-O, and O=C
to the cleaned acetlycellulose, 778, 1104, and 1721 cm 1, are not prominent. 778 cm 1is
corresponding to the CH group and 1104 cm 1is signifying C-O bonding, however, O=C is
signiﬁed by 1721 cm 1band. Nevertheless, the band of 1049 cm 1was attained in the used
sample without cleaning and disappeared in the cleaned sample, which corresponds to
C-O group. The spectral bands observed in the range of 3000 to 2900 cm 1can be attributed
to the symmetrical stretching of CH 3groups. Additionally, the notable bands appearing
around 3500 and 3400 cm 1are indicative of OH stretching. [ 6,20]. These results indicate
few differences are observed between ACF-used and cleaned ones. Also, the FTIR spectrum
data reveals that ACF- contain cellulose acetate in their composition. Further, the treatment
process did not promote the destruction of the cellulose ﬁber.

 3.1.2. Acetlycellulose FTIR  
The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of both acetlycellulose prior to 
and after cleaning are investigated and are displayed in Figure 3. As shown in Figure 3, 
both curves (a and b) illustrate the bands at  1030, 1327, 1432, and 1756 cm−1 appearing in 
both ACF samples that reflect the presence of various groups. The acetlycellulose fiber 
exhibited similar ba nd intensities at 1104 cm−1 are an indication of the presence of C-O. 
Furthermore, the distinctive peak associated with  O=C bonding should be placed at wave-
number 1721 cm−1. The band at 778 cm−1 corresponds to the CH bending mode, which ap-
pears in the cleaned sample. The newly formed bonds of CH, C-O, and O=C to the cleaned 
acetlycellulose, 778, 1104, and 1721 cm−1, are not prominent. 778 cm−1 is corresponding to 
the CH group and 1104 cm−1 is signifying C-O bonding, howe ver, O=C is signified by 1721 
cm−1 band. Nevertheless, the band of 1049 cm−1 was attained in the used sample without 
cleaning and disappeared in the cleaned sa mple, which corresponds to C-O group. The 
spectral bands observed in the range of 3000 to 2900 cm−1 can be attributed to the symmet-
rical stretching of CH 3 groups. Additionally, the notable bands appearing around 3500 
and 3400 cm−1 are indicative of OH stretching. [6,20] . These results indicate few differences 
are observed between ACF-used and cleaned on es. Also, the FTIR spectrum data reveals 
that ACF- contain cellulose acetate in their composition. Further, the treatment process 
did not promote the destruction of the cellulose fiber.

Initially, prior to scheming the sorption matrix, it is essential to assess the isotherm 
equilibrium time profile. The ti me of Levafix Blue dye sorption through acetlycellulose 
ribbon fiber was explored at room temperat ure, and the corresponding results are dis-
played in Figure 4. Data compared the sorption capacity of used and cleaned cigarette 
filters as presented in Figure  4a, and b, respectively.  
Cleaned filters showed higher sorption ca pacity for Levafix Blue than the unclean 
one, most of the dye was adsorbed within th e first two hours. The acetlycellulose ribbon 
which possesses available clean pores is more  pronounced for adsorption instead of the

3.2.2. Effect of Various Adsorption Parameters 
For the object of maximizing the adsorption uptake, the effect of the adsorption pa-
rameters was investigated and the results are shown in Figure 5. Initially, the adsorbent 
dose plays a significant role in the degree of adsorption uptake. In this regard, to estimate 
the effect of adsorbent dose, adsorption ex periments were conducted using various ad-
sorbent doses of ACF ribbon in the range of 0.25 to 2 g/L, whereas other adsorption pa-
rameters are kept constant (Levafix Blue co ncentration of 25 mg/L, temperature pH 6.0 
and 298 K). Results illustrated in Figure 5a estimate the adsorption capacity of Levafix 
Blue enhanced with the elevation in ACF ribbon Sorbents amounting up to 1 g/L since the 
upsurge in the available adsorption sites. However, further elevation in the ACF ribbon 
does result in a deduction in Levafix Blue uptake. 
Figure 4. Adsorption isotherm time-proﬁle on the Levaﬁx Blue CA dye uptake with various adsor-
bents (Levaﬁx Blue 25 mg/L; ACF ribbon 1 g/L; pH 6 and 298 K).
Cleaned ﬁlters showed higher sorption capacity for Levaﬁx Blue than the unclean one,
most of the dye was adsorbed within the ﬁrst two hours. The acetlycellulose ribbon which
possesses available clean pores is more pronounced for adsorption instead of the non-
clean ribbon. Due to acetlycellulose’s special characteristics of hydrophobicity behaviors
towards water and excluding water, the ACF ribbon adsorbed dye molecules. Thus, the
cleaning process might provide more speciﬁc sites. The importance of acetylcellulose in
enhancing the adsorption capacity aligns with the ﬁndings reported by Yang et al. [ 10],
as stated in previous published studies. Their results showed high signiﬁcant adsorption
uptake of Au(III) onto acetlycellulose ﬁber. The surface of acetylcellulose demonstrates
efﬁciency in adsorbing dye molecules through hydrophobic interactions. These ﬁndings
provide evidence for the crucial role of acetylcellulose’s hydrophobic nature, enabling
higher dye uptake. Moreover, as depicted in Figure 4, both adsorbents exhibit additional
dye uptake beyond the initial 2 h period, primarily due to the occupation of available active
sites. However, once the acetylcellulose ﬁbers become saturated, there is no further dye
uptake observed.
3.2.2. Effect of Various Adsorption Parameters
For the object of maximizing the adsorption uptake, the effect of the adsorption param-
eters was investigated and the results are shown in Figure 5. Initially, the adsorbent dose
plays a signiﬁcant role in the degree of adsorption uptake. In this regard, to estimate the
effect of adsorbent dose, adsorption experiments were conducted using various adsorbent
doses of ACF ribbon in the range of 0.25 to 2 g/L, whereas other adsorption parameters
are kept constant (Levaﬁx Blue concentration of 25 mg/L, temperature pH 6.0 and 298 K).
Results illustrated in Figure 5a estimate the adsorption capacity of Levaﬁx Blue enhanced
with the elevation in ACF ribbon Sorbents amounting up to 1 g/L since the upsurge in theProcesses 2023 ,11, 2701 8 of 17
available adsorption sites. However, further elevation in the ACF ribbon does result in a
deduction in Levaﬁx Blue uptake.

Figure 5. Equilibrium adsorption uptakes are obtainable at various ( a) adsorbent dose; ( b) pH; ( c) 
temperature and ( d) different initial dye concentrations. 
The data in Figure 5a might be associat ed with the upsurge of adsorbent concentra-
tion at a constant adsorbate loading that result s in the unsaturation of sorption sites. Also, 
the extra ACF ribbon that is present in exce ss could trigger the aggregation and ribbon 
contact with each other. Hence,  the result was a deduction in the overall surface area of 
the available ACF ribbon. Thereby, the ACF ri bbon dose is proportional to Levafix Blue 
uptake. To add up, the Levafix Blue removal dr op could be a result of the restabilization 
of the dye particles. Such results are in agr eement with the previous reports of Chu [22] 
for dye molecule adsorption with different adsorbent materials. 
To evaluate the pH effect and maximize the adsorption capacity, the pH effect on the 
adsorption capacity was assessed at different pH  values (3, 6, 8, and 10) whereas all other 
operational parameters are fixed. The data pr esented in Figure 5b indicates that, for all 
ACF ribbon samples, the maximum adsorption uptake is achieved  at a pH of 5.6 and 5.04 
for the cleaned and used ACF fibers, respectively. However, a further increase in pH value 
leads to a decline in the adsorption capacity, particularly at alkaline pH levels. This phe-nomenon can be attributed to the potential damage to the active sites on the ACF ribbon 
adsorbent material. Additionally, the pH valu e influences the surface charge of the ACF 
material. As a result, the adsorption of Levafix  Blue dye is closely related to the surface 
charge of the ACF ribbon, rather than the pH of the solution. Also, the increase in the 
solution’s pH weakened the attraction be tween the ACF ribbon and the Levafix Blue 
Figure 5. Equilibrium adsorption uptakes are obtainable at various ( a) adsorbent dose; ( b) pH;

The data in Figure 5a might be associated with the upsurge of adsorbent concentration
at a constant adsorbate loading that results in the unsaturation of sorption sites. Also,
the extra ACF ribbon that is present in excess could trigger the aggregation and ribbon
contact with each other. Hence, the result was a deduction in the overall surface area of
the available ACF ribbon. Thereby, the ACF ribbon dose is proportional to Levaﬁx Blue
uptake. To add up, the Levaﬁx Blue removal drop could be a result of the restabilization of
the dye particles. Such results are in agreement with the previous reports of Chu [ 22] for
dye molecule adsorption with different adsorbent materials.
To evaluate the pH effect and maximize the adsorption capacity, the pH effect on the
adsorption capacity was assessed at different pH values (3, 6, 8, and 10) whereas all other
operational parameters are ﬁxed. The data presented in Figure 5b indicates that, for all ACF
ribbon samples, the maximum adsorption uptake is achieved at a pH of 5.6 and 5.04 for the
cleaned and used ACF ﬁbers, respectively. However, a further increase in pH value leads
to a decline in the adsorption capacity, particularly at alkaline pH levels. This phenomenon
can be attributed to the potential damage to the active sites on the ACF ribbon adsorbent
material. Additionally, the pH value inﬂuences the surface charge of the ACF material. As a
result, the adsorption of Levaﬁx Blue dye is closely related to the surface charge of the ACFProcesses 2023 ,11, 2701 9 of 17
ribbon, rather than the pH of the solution. Also, the increase in the solution’s pH weakened
the attraction between the ACF ribbon and the Levaﬁx Blue aqueous solution. Chu [ 22]
reported the pH value might affect the removal of dye using alum sludge adsorbent.
Figure 5c shows the temperature effect on Levaﬁx Blue adsorption capacity since
the industrial discharge may be disposed of at different temperatures. From this concept,
the aqueous solution temperature was adjusted over the range of 298 to 333 K. The data
displayed in Figure 5c exhibits that the Levaﬁx Blue CA sorption capacity is increased with
temperature increase. However, the reaction is further diminished with the further temper-
ature upsurge up to 313 K. Such results might demonstrate the improvement of the Levaﬁx
Blue CA desorption stage in the adsorption process verifying the reaction is exothermic
at a high-temperature degree [ 21]. Moreover, the temperature elevation deteriorates the
sorptive forces between the ACF ribbon active sites and the Levaﬁx molecules, and between
adjacent Levaﬁx Blue dye molecules on the sorbed phase. A comparable reaction trend was
investigated and recorded by Parker et al. [23].
The impact of the initial Levaﬁx Blue loading is exhibited in Figure 5d. Data rep-
resents the inﬂuence of the initial Levaﬁx Blue dye concentration that is in the range of
(25–100 mg/L) at 298 K on the adsorption capacity using both adsorbents cleaned and
non-cleaned ACF ribbon. Generally, for all the applied materials, a noticeable enhancement
in the adsorption uptake is attained with an increase in the dye concentration. This is due
to the high Levaﬁx dose resulting in an interaction between the Levaﬁx molecules and ACF
ribbon adsorbent material. The cleaned ACF ribbon showed higher adsorption capacities
overall since the available pores are more than the used and non-cleaned ones.
This investigation recorded the enhancing adsorption uptake with the elevating adsor-
bate concentration which was previously recorded by Mittal and Gupta [ 24] when applying
oiled soya ash for dye removal. Additionally, Geng et al. [ 25] reported similar results in
using clay minerals in dye adsorption from an aqueous waste stream. Therefore, such data
conﬁrms the improvement in the mass transfer rate between the adsorbate and the surface
of the adsorbent substance [25].
3.2.3. Acetylcellulose Regeneration
The recyclability of the acetylcellulose is investigated and the data is recorded in
Figure 6. Initially, the ribbon was regenerated after use. The ﬁber is regenerated by
subjecting it to hot water cleaning to remove any due saturation and attached to the
acetylcellulose ﬁber. Then, the ﬁber is tested for 6 cycles of adsorption–desorption. As
displayed in Figure 6, Levaﬁx Blue dye removal efﬁciency onto the acetylcellulose ﬁber was
maintained well since the removal capacity is still above 74% after six cycles of adsorption.
This veriﬁes that acetylcellulose is an ideal candidate for Levaﬁx Blue dye water as a
textile-simulated aqueous media discharge treatment application.
The adsorbent surface was examined after it was loaded with dye molecules as shown
in Figure 7a. The loaded SEM image displays the Levaﬁx Blue dye adsorption on the
acetylcellulose ribbon. The depicted surface after adsorption (Figure 7a) is clearly different
in shape and size compared to the unsaturated with dye ribbon and changed to an uneven
and rougher surface (Figure 2b). This means the clean unused ribbon possesses a large
number of active sites available and is responsible for facile Levaﬁx Blue adsorption.
After adsorption, (Figure 7a) Levaﬁx Blue ﬁlls the surface of the adsorbent and becomes
saturated, covered by the dye molecule. Also, as seen in the image, the blockage of pores
was recognized which veriﬁes the successful Levaﬁx Blue adsorption process. This is due
to the Levaﬁx Blue dye molecules covering the surface of acetylcellulose ﬁber in a layered
fashion, which displays a different morphology from the original acetylcellulose ribbon.Processes 2023 ,11, 2701 10 of 17

Figure 6. Regeneration and successive use of acetylcellulose ribbon. 
The adsorbent surface was examined after it was loaded with dye molecules as 
shown in Figure 7a. The loaded SEM image di splays the Levafix Blue dye adsorption on 
the acetylcellulose ribbon. The depicted surfac e after adsorption (Figure 7a) is clearly dif-
ferent in shape and size compared to the un saturated with dye ribbon and changed to an 
uneven and rougher surface (Figure 2b). This  means the clean unused ribbon possesses a 
large number of active sites available and is responsible for facile Levafix Blue adsorption. 
After adsorption, (Figure 7a) Levafix Blue fi lls the surface of the adsorbent and becomes 
saturated, covered by the dye molecule. Also, as seen in the image, the blockage of pores 
was recognized which verifies the successful Le vafix Blue adsorption process. This is due 
to the Levafix Blue dye molecules covering the surface of acetylcellulose fiber in a layered 
fashion, which displays a different morphology from the original acetylcellulose ribbon.  
Figure 7b illustrates the surface of the acetylcellulose ribbon after cyclic use and 
cleaning. The shape of the ribbon's fibrous structure was changed, and the surface was 
disturbed due to successive use and washing. Also, a smoother surface is attained com-
pared to the first use which is saturated with dye. Coarse patches were still appearing, 
and some ribbon parts were still undiscerned. However, it is noteworthy to mention that 
even if the ribbon shape is changed acetylcellul ose fiber is still able to dye sorption for 
successive cycles which valorizes the tendency  of acetylcellulose derived from waste re-
siduals to be a sustainable candid ate for dual waste elimination.  
This study is leading to useful results in  the environmental engineering field. This 
treatment method not only eliminates the negative environmental externalities impact of 
cigarette residuals but also introduces an ec onomic and costless method for wastewater 
treatment. Thus, cigarette residuals that are si gnified as a source of acetlycellulose are an 
appropriate industrial ecology adsorbent type.

Figure 7b illustrates the surface of the acetylcellulose ribbon after cyclic use and

disturbed due to successive use and washing. Also, a smoother surface is attained compared
to the ﬁrst use which is saturated with dye. Coarse patches were still appearing, and some
ribbon parts were still undiscerned. However, it is noteworthy to mention that even if
the ribbon shape is changed acetylcellulose ﬁber is still able to dye sorption for successive
cycles which valorizes the tendency of acetylcellulose derived from waste residuals to be a
sustainable candidate for dual waste elimination.
This study is leading to useful results in the environmental engineering ﬁeld. This
treatment method not only eliminates the negative environmental externalities impact of
cigarette residuals but also introduces an economic and costless method for wastewater
treatment. Thus, cigarette residuals that are signiﬁed as a source of acetlycellulose are an
appropriate industrial ecology adsorbent type.
To investigate and verify the importance of the current study compared to the lit-
erature, comparative data is achieved. A comparison of different types of Levaﬁx dyes
adsorption performance using the acetylcellulose ribbon derived from waste residuals in
the current study with various adsorbents reported in the literature has been provided
in Table 1. It is clear that acetylcellulose has a superlative ability to remove Levaﬁx dye
with a high adsorption capacity. Acetylcellulose could adsorb the dye as high as 87% when
tested at room temperature as simulated textile wastewater. Thus, the bottom line is that
acetylcellulose adsorbent substance acquires a better ability to eliminate textile residuals
at simple technique tendency. Although the other studies also revealed a high removal
efﬁciency and reached complete removal, the treatment is adopted from adsorbent material
based on chemical uses [ 26–29]. It is important to mention that the current investigation of
adsorbents is derived from waste residuals. Furthermore, previous studies have focused
on adsorption-based treatments or the combination of adsorption and oxidation reactions,
unlike the present study which indicates that the treatment is not solely reliant on adsorp-
tion [ 26–28]. This implies that such techniques may incur additional treatment costs, thus
increasing the overall economic burden. In contrast, the utilization of acetylcellulose waste
materials as affordable substances for eliminating textile pollutants from aqueous streams
offers various advantageous aspects. These include their potential to reduce waste disposal
costs and contribute to environmental safety.Processes 2023 ,11, 2701 11 of 17

3.2.4. Adsorption Isotherm Moelds
To investigate the adsorption mechanism of Levaﬁx Blue dye on acetylcellulose, the
experimental results were examined to assess the performance of various isotherm models
(Langmuir, Freundlich, and D-R), as depicted in Figure 8. The constant parameters of
the linearized equations corresponding to these isotherm models were determined and
presented in Table 2.Processes 2023 ,11, 2701 12 of 17

The purposes of such ﬁtting are to assess the maximum adsorption capacity and
describe the equilibrium between Levaﬁx Blue and acetylcellulose. This provides different
binding sites and afﬁnities in the adsorbent. The assessment of the acetylcellulose adsorp-
tion process was based on the comparison of the correlation coefﬁcients, R2values, of those
models (Table 2). The experimental data was assessed through their linearized form. The
linearized form of the Langmuir model was applied in this study [30]:
Ce
qe=1
KL+aL
KLCe (2)
Qo=KL
aL(3)
where Ceis the Levaﬁx Blue concentration at equilibrium (mg/L), qeis the equilibrium
adsorption capacity, and aLand KLare Langmuir adsorption constants. Qois the monolayer
adsorption capacity of the solid adsorbent (mg/g).
The Freundlich model is appropriate for the highly heterogeneous surface and it is
classiﬁed by the heterogeneity constant 1/ n. The linearized form of the model is according
to Equation (4) [21]:
ln(qe)=lnK F+1
nlnC e (4)
where KFis the Freundlich constant that relates to the adsorption capacity (L/g). 1/ nis the
heterogeneity constant that measures the adsorption intensity and presents a signiﬁcance
of how the adsorption is favorable when n is superior to unity, characterizing a favorable
sorption system.

system and its linearized form according to the following:
lnqe=lnqm KDR#2(5)
#2=RTln

Ce
(6)
In Equation (7), qm represents the monolayer saturation capacity (L/g), and KDR
denotes the D-R isotherm constant for adsorption energy. This constant provides insights
into the mean free energy (E) of sorption per molecule of the sorbate. The calculated value
of E indicates the nature of the adsorption process, whether it is a chemical or physical
adsorption process.
E=1p2KDR(7)Processes 2023 ,11, 2701 14 of 17
The D-R isotherm simulates that adsorption is limited to a monolayer and can be used
to assess the adsorption energy [21,30].
According to the correlation coefﬁcient values, R2, Frendlich isotherm or D-R isotherms
are not as adequate as the Langmuir isotherm model. The equilibrium data of acetylcellu-
lose sorbent material demonstrated a strong correlation with the Langmuir isotherm model,
as indicated in Table 2. This suggests that the adsorption process can be categorized as
homogeneous surface adsorption. and the adsorbed Levaﬁx molecules are sorbed onto the
monolayer coverage till the acetylcellulose’s active sites are saturated. Also, when the n
value ranges from 1 < n < 10, the sorption is signiﬁed as a favorable one (Table 2, n is more
than unity).
3.2.5. Kinetics of Levaﬁx Blue Sorption Characteristics
For the objective of evaluating the magnitude and mechanism of Levaﬁx Blue CA
dye sorption on the acetylcellulose material, kinetic models were applied. Lagergren’s
pseudo-ﬁrst order, pseudo-second order, and Bangham’s equation were used to assess the
sorption parameters for each kinetic model. Lagergren’s pseudo-ﬁrst order Equation (7)
indicates that the sorption of the dye onto the acetylcellulose substance is a solo sorption
dye molecule [21].
log(qe qt)=K1
2.303t+log(qe) (8)
The pseudo-second-order kinetic model simulates the sorption sites as proportional to
the square number of vacant sites as displayed in (Equation (9)) [31].
t
qe=1
K2q2

where K2expressed the adsorption pseudo-second-order rate constant.
Further, Banghams’s model was applied to signify if the pore-diffusion is solely
limiting the rate of the adsorption system according to the following equation:

where KBandaare Banghams’s model constants and ( < 1), m, and V are the mass and
volume of acetylcellulose, respectively [32].
Comparing correlation coefﬁcient values, R2,for the three models (data computed in
Table 3) signiﬁes pseudo-second-order model is well-ﬁtted in comparison to the models
that possess the highest correlation coefﬁcient ever. For both sorbent materials based on
cleaned and used acetylcellulose, the excellent R2is 0.99. Furthermore, the calculated
equilibrium capacity for the dye is closer to the results attained from the experimental data.

4. Conclusions
Acetlycellulose was extracted and prepared from augmented cigarette ﬁlter waste in
this study. The ﬁber was extracted by treatment and washing to be available as adsorbent
material. The material is examined and analyzed using SEM and FTIR before and after
cleaning. The attained acetlycellulose ﬁber was estimated to be an efﬁcient adsorbent,
which revealed excellent dye removal efﬁcacy. The adsorption afﬁnity reached 4.8 mg/g at
the optimized conditions of pH 6.0 and adsorbent dose 1 g through the isotherm time of 2 h.
Isotherm modeling and kinetic data demonstrated the reaction follows 1st-order kinetics
and the reaction follows Langmuir isotherm. Not only does such an investigation delivers
a potential method for dye elimination, but also speciﬁes a way to realize the resource
utilization of waste acetlycellulose by-product from smoking residuals to satisfy the goal of
the industrial ecology approach. Therefore, a complimentary effort is still essential in the
future study to apply such technique in real polluted efﬂuents.
