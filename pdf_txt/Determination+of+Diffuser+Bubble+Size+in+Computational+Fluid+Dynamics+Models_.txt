RESEARCH INTERESTS  
 
My research  interests are in b iological wastewater and sludge treatment s (Activated 
sludge, Anaerobic digestion) , various processes for minimisation of s ludge production, 
Enhanced energy recovery processes from anaerobic system, mathematical model ling 
(Activated Sludge Models, Anaerobic digestion models) and Life cycle assessment  for 
water/wastewater facilities. I am also interested in developing emerging process es for 
industrial wastewater treatment field.  
I have been actively involved in planning research  proposals to develop ment  of 
innovative treatment processes  for w ater and w astewater . I find myself c apable of 
identifying technical challenges  at water and wastewater treatment industries, and 
conducting research to  find out the solutions .
