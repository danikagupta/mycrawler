The textile industry produces  persistent or ganic pollutants (POPs) that pose significant risks to ecosystems because of 
their toxic and hazardous nature. Consequently, there is an urgent  requirement for the development of effective 
techniques to treat the effluents and rem ove these compounds. This work studied the viability of the  Electro -Fenton 
(EF) process as a potential alternative for treating  textile wastewater contaminated with POPs . A batch electrochemical 
reactor , equipped with a platinum grid cathode  and stainless -steel sacrificial anode,  was utilized to eliminate  Red 
Bemacid (RB) dye. The study investigated the impact of  four key operational parameters : (i) stirring speed ( rpm), (ii) 
oxygen flow rate (L/min), (iii)  supporting electrolyte concentration [Na 2SO 4] (mg/L), and (iv) current inten sity (A) , as 
well as  their interactions on RB removal. To perform this,  Central Composite Experimental Design (CCD) and 
Response Surface Methodology (RSM) were employed. Under  optimized EF conditions for RB removal (stirring speed 
= 205.09 rpm, oxygen flow  rate = 0.20 L/min, current intensity = 0.306 A, and supporting electrolyte concentration = 
0.09 M), the EF process demonstrated exceptional  removal efficiency, achieving approximately  94.51% removal of 
RB. The obtained results showed that the kinetic data  of RB removal were in good agreement with the Behnajady-
Modirshahla -Ghanbery (BMG) model. The CCD analysis revealed that the main effect of the current intensity had a 
significant impact on RB removal, as well as the interaction of all paired variables.

INTRODUCTION  
Generally, the continuous release of synthetic 
dyes from different types of manufacturing 
industries, such as cosmetic, pri nting, industrial 
pharmaceutical, food colorants, paper production, 
plastics, leather, and textile, is highly undesirable 
due to the persistent nature of the resulting 
colored effluents. These effluents have the ability 
to persist in the environment for exte nded periods  
of time , posing a significant threat to ecosystems 
and human health.1-4 The discharge of effluents 
containing synthetic dyes into water resources 
presents serious  risks to both human well -being 
and the delicate balance of the aquatic ecosyst em.   
This is primarily due to the complex and 
harmful properties exhibited by these dyes, including carcinogenicity, toxicity, and 
persistence. The harmful effects of synthetic dyes 
extend beyond human health, with long- lasting 
detrimental impacts on aqua tic life.
2-7 Moreover, 
the treatment of textile waste, a major contributor 
to such effluents, has become increasingly 
challenging, posing a significant obstacle for 
researchers and industrialists in effectively 
addressing the treatment and mitigation of th ese 
hazardous substances.2,7-8 K. MAAMAR  et al . 
892 
 Over the past two decades, Advanced 
Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have emerged as 
effective methods for degrading non-
biodegradable organic compounds in water, 
particularly those with complex and inert 
characteristics.9,10 These techniques utilize highly 
reactive hydroxyl radicals (OH●) to efficiently 
attack and oxidize refractory contaminants, leading to the degradation of persistent organic 
matter with large and intricate structures .
7,10-12 
Among the AOPs, the Electro -Fenton (EF) 
process is recognized as an environmentally 
friendly, cost-effective, efficient, and promising 
technology for the removal of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) .
10,12-13 It involves the 
continuous in situ  electro -generation of Fenton’ s 
reagents (hydrogen peroxide and ferrous ions), 
which serve as precursors for hydroxyl radicals. 
The formation of hydroxyl radicals occurs 
through the reaction between ferrous ions and 
hydrogen peroxide, as shown in the following 
Equation (1):14-17  
23
22H O Fe OH OH Fe+ • −++→++                     (1)  
Several combinations  were deve loped to 
generate F enton’s reagent :18-19 
• EF-H2O2: H2O2 is generat ed at cathode by 
two-electron  reduction of dissolved oxygen,19-20 
while  Fe²⁺ is added externally to the process ;21  
• Addition of EF -reagents:  Both species 
H2O2 and Fe2+ are externally added to the 
electrolytic c ell from outside ;18,22  
• Ferred -Fenton process : Fe2+ is produced at 
cathode by Fe3+ reduction, but H 2O2 is externally 
added in solution;   
• Addition of Fe3+: Fe3+ is externally added, 
and Fenton’s reagents are electro -generated via 
cathodic  reduction ; 
• EF-Feox  method : H2O2 is externally added, 
whereas Fe²⁺ is continuously provided by 
oxidation at anode ;1,8,18,20,23   
• Electrochemical generation of Fenton’s 
reagent (Fe2+ and H 2O2): Fe2+ is generated at 
sacrificial anode and H 2O2 is generated by a 
reduction of dissolved oxygen at cathode .1,8,19,20,24 
The stringency of the EF process is defined by 
the control of various factors: (i) factors 
governing the electrochemical process, (ii) factors 
governing the electro- generation of Fenton’ s 
reagent, and (iii) factors controlling the reaction 
mechanism of organic mat ter degradation. 
However, the complexity of the process may 
require optimization of the factors governing 
Fenton ’s reagent generation , while maintaining constant parameters of the electrochemical cell 
that were initially optimized , such as voltage, 
electro lyte nature, current density, and initial dye 
concentration.  
Several researchers have applied EF 
technology to treat refractory effluents, including 
dyes, pesticides, and anti -inflammatory 
pharmaceuticals. These studies have demonstrated the remarkable eff iciency of the EF technique in 
degrading such effluents .
25-30 Do et al. have used 
the EF process to remove residual dye products, 
employing magnetite coated metallic foams as a 
cathode. They have observed a removal efficiency 
of 95.2% at 50 ppm after 120 m inutes of 
electrolysis, and an exceptional removal 
efficiency of 99.8% was achieved at 100 ppm 
after 60 minutes of electrolysis.2 The application 
of the EF process for treating real dyeing 
wastewater using an activated carbon fibre 
cathode was performed by  Wang et al .25 Their 
results showed that the achieved COD removal 
efficiency was 75.2% under the current density of 
3.2 mA/cm2.25 Ghoneim et al .26 have studied the 
EF oxidation of aggressive water soluble Sunset 
Yellow FCF azo -dye using a n RVC cathode. 
Their analysis  revealed that  the mineralization of 
pollutant reached 97% after 2 hours of reaction.26 
On the other hand, the EF process was also used  
by M . Panizza et al.27 in order to degrade Alizarin 
Red using a gas -diffusion cathode for producing 
hydrogen peroxide. Their analyses proved that the 
COD removal in the presence of ferrous ion has 
significant results , and may reach up to or exceed  
90%. However, in the absence of ferrous ions, the 
COD removal was 45% .27  
In this study, Response Surface Methodology  
(RSM) was applied using a Central Composite 
Design (CCD) to investigate the main effects of 
variables controlling the interaction  of Fenton’s 
reagents with an organic dye -based pollutant and 
to optimize the process variables for Fenton 
reagent regeneratio n and dye removal. 
Furthermore, four independent variables were examined: supporting electrolyte concentration 
(mg/L) [Na
2SO 4], oxygen flow rate (L/min), 
stirring speed (rpm), and current intensity (A). 
The response function (dependent variable) was 
the de colorization efficiency of Red Bemacid 
(RB) dye, Y (%), by the EF process, measured using UV -Vis spectroscopy . Correlations were 
found between the independent and dependent 
variables, contributing to the understanding of 
factors influencing the electro- generation of 
Fenton ’s reagent and, consequently, factors Textile  
893 
 improving the degradation mechanism of the RB 
reaction. The optimum values of the 
corresponding EF process variables were also 
predicted by CCD.  
 EXPERIMENTAL  
Chemical  analysis  
The RB dye (C24H20ClN 4NaO6S2) used in this study 
was provided by a textile company from  the West of 
Algeria. Sulfuric acid  and sodium hydroxide were both 
obtained from Merck,  of 98% purity , and were utilized 
for pH adjustment  as diluted solutions ( 1M). Sodium 
sulphate  (95% pure)  and sodium chloride with a purity  
of 98% were used as supporting electrolyte. All 
solutions were prepared using distilled water at room 
temperature.  
 
Electrochemical reactor  
EF experiments were performed  at room 
temperature of 23 ±  1 °C in a 200 mL batch electro -
chemical reactor . The reactor was controlled by an 
adjustable DC power supply unit  and the solution was 
homogenized by  agitation ranging  from  200 to 800 
rpm using  a magnetic stirrer. A stainless  steel sheet 
(4.2 cm  × 3.1 cm  ×1 mm) was used as the sacrificial 
anode , while a  platinum  plate grid (3 cm × 2.9 cm × 
0.5 mm ) served as the cathode.24,28 During  the EF 
treatment,  the pH value of the solution  was adjusted 
between 2.8 and 3.0 , by adding either NaOH (1M) or H2SO 4 (1M) .29 Moreover, the oxygen flow was 
controlled by a Gilmont I nstruments flow meter.  
In this study, Fenton’s reagent s (Fe2+ and H 2O2) 
were electro -generated . Hydrogen peroxide wa s 
accumul ated at the cathode by a continuous aeration 
according to Eq uation  (2).2,30-31

Meanwhile, the Fe2+ ions we re simultaneous ly 
generated through a sacrificial anode and regenerated 
by the reduction of Fe3+ ions at the cathode  according 
to Eq uation  (3) and Equation (4), respectively:9,12

Analytical procedure  
All samples of initial and residual dye 
concentrations were measured spectrophot ometrically, 
using a Shimadzu UV –vis spectrophotometer at the 
maximum wavelength of the dye, approximately 509 nm. The relation used  to calculate the degradation 
efficiency, Y (%), of Red Bemacid (RB) dye is given 
by Equation (5):

Central Composit e Design (CCD)  
In general, R esponse Surface Methodology (RSM) 
is considered as a collection of different statistical and 
mathematical processing tools. In addition, this 
meth odology is performed for different applications of 
empirical model design and anal ysis in order to display 
the effects of several factors at different levels on the 
measured response.  Moreover, t his technique is  used in 
order  to optimize the process  and to reduce  the number 
of experimental  runs.9,33-36 In this study,  a CCD  was 
applied t o investigate  the relation between the 
independent variable s (factors) affecting Fenton’s 
reagent and t he removal efficiency of RB  (Y, %), and 
to determine the optim um values  of the operating 
independent variables.  The chosen factors , considered 
as indepen dent variables : stirring speed ( A), oxygen 
flow ( B), current density ( C) and Na 2SO 4 concentration 
(D), the coded levels and the ranges selected for the 
experimentation were  listed in T able 1.14,18  
The CCD was divided in three groups of design 
points:  
1. The full factorial – was applied between the low 
level ( -1) and the high level (+1) ; this design with 2 
level s and 4 factors (k) has  2k runs = 16  runs;  
2. The center points  – denot ed in coded variables 
as 0; a better variance estimate was evaluated by 3 to 6 
repeats of center points ; for this study, 6 repeats were 
used;  3.  The axial points  called star points  – each 
variable  was placed at ±  α and all other factors were at 
zero.  Further selection of the Face- Centered Design in 
CCD set s the value of α (the distance of the axial point 
from the center) to ±1 .37 Thus , the position of axial 
points stands within the factorial region .14,18 The 
number  of the axial points w as 8. 
Therefore , a total of 30 trials were  used for this 
study and the design matrix was developed in T able 2. 
The interaction effects are calculated by multiplying two or more independent variables. The response  of 
the decolorization  efficiency of RB dye, Y (%), 
analyzed by the UV-Vis spectrophotometer , was listed 
in Table 2. The experimental data fitted in to a 
generated  polynomial model  between the dependent 
variable (or response) Y and independent variables (or

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
Results of preliminary test s  
To emphasize the variables influenci ng the 
electro -generation of the Fenton reagent, which is 
essential for the degradation of organic matter, 
preliminary tests were conducted to optimize the 
parameters of the electrochemical cell (voltage, nature of the electrolyte, and initial concentra tion 
of the dye).  
In this study, the first electrochemical variable 
tested  was the nature of the supporting electrolyte . 
The addition of this electrolyte is required to 
improve the conductivity of the solution  
containing an organic pollutant .

 studies.21 As illustrate d in a study using the same 
electrica l power, the addition of Na 2SO 4 led to an 
increased RB elimination  efficiency  (91.50%), 
compared  to the addition of NaCl (74.26% ). This 
decrease in the presence of NaCl electrolyte could 
be attributed to the formation of reaction 
intermediates , specificall y through the reaction  
between chloride ions (Cl-) and hydroxyl radicals 
(OH•), chloride ions can act as scavengers of 
hydroxyl radicals .31 
OH Cl HOCl• −• −+→                               (10) 
In an EF  system, the applied voltage is  an 
important factor that greatly influences  the 
generation of hydrogen peroxide at the cathode . 
Moreover, a n increase in the voltage leads to an 
accumulation of OH• and consequently enhances 
the elimination of organic pollutants . Figure 2b 
display s the RB removal due to  the E F process at 
diverse voltages . In addition, an increase in RB 
removal efficiency up to 91.2% is observed at an 
applied voltage of 5 V. Beyond 5 V, a decrease in 
RB degradation is detected, likely due to the 
excessive generation of hydrogen peroxide 
resulting from the recombinati on of OH● (Eq. 11) 
and the reaction between H 2O2 and OH● (Eq. 12), 
leading to the formation of reaction 
intermediates .1,20

Generally, the efficiency of pollutant remova l 
depends on its initial concentration. An inversely 
proportional relationship between the initial 
concentration of dye and the efficiency of the EF 
proces s is observed for three initial concentrations 
of RB solutions (100, 200, and 500 mg/L), as 
shown in Fig ure 2c. The obtained results 
demonstrate that the degradation rate of RB dye 
decreases with increasing initial concentrations. 
Consequently, this result  can be explained by the 
need for a large number of hydroxyl radicals to 
eliminate the high concentra tions of the 
contaminant .11 Indeed, the results show that the 
EF process, under adequate conditions, achieves 
the highest removal value of 95% for RB dye 
after 60 minutes at an initial concentration of 100 
mg/L.  
The electrochemical cell variables were 
optimized from preliminary tests and were 
utilized in this work to show the influence of 
electro -generation factors of the Fenton reagent, 
which is essential f or organic matter degradation. However, the optimized parameters are as 
follows: the nature of the supporting electrolyte: 
Na2SO 4; voltage: 5 V, and initial concentration of 
the pollutant (RB dye):  100 m g/L. 
Kinetic analysis of RB d egradation  
The BMG model  is considered essential for 
predicting the rate of RB dye degradation, providing a comprehensive understanding of the 
efficiency of the oxidation process. RB dye is 
oxidized by OH• radicals, following the kinetics 
of the BMG model ( R² > 0.96), as shown in Table 
3.  
The values of K
app and linear correlation (R2) 
from pseudo -first- and pseudo- second -order  
kinetics are presented in Table 3. K 1 and K 2 
represent the apparent pseudo- first- and pseudo-
second -order reaction constants, respectively. All 
the values of rate constants, K 1 and K 2, for the 
elimination of RB dye under the corresponding 
operating condit ions fixed above by EF, were 
analytically determined from the slope of Ln 
(C0/Ct) against process t, and 1/C t -1/C 0 against t, 
respectively. Based on the co rrelation coefficients 
(R2) indicated in Table 3, the experimental data 
better align with the pseudo- first-order reaction 
mechanism (as evidenced by high R2 values). 
Thus, the obtained results presented in Table 3 
demonstrate that an increase in the initial 
concentration of RB dye leads to a decrease in the 
pseudo- first-order rate constants. This action can 
be explained by the performance acceleration of the competitive reactions between the oxidizing 
RB dye by- products forming during the EF 
process and hyd roxyl free radicals.
1 
According to the values of correlation 
coefficient (R2) illustrated in Table 3 , the BMG 
model exhibits the highest R2 values, indicating 
that the experimental data are better fitted by the 
BMG kinetic model. The degradation reaction 
occurs in two stages: a fast rate stage, followed by 
a slower second stage, as shown in Figure 2c. 
These two stages are characterized by the values 
of 1/m and 1/b, which represent the initial reaction rate and the maximum reaction fraction, 
respectively.

The Central Composite Face- centered (CCF) 
design was used to fit the second- order model and 
determine  the optimum process factors  (variables)  
that influenc e the electro -generation of the

 Depending on the results of multiple validation 
tests (Table 4) , analyzing the experimental data, 
the quadratic model was classified to be the best 
fitting model. Furthermore, the adequacy of this 
model which is estab lished by ANOVA analysis, was confirmed by the correlation coefficient 
determination (R2 = 0.99) and the adjusted 
determination coefficient (R2Adj = 0.973) , which is 
greater than 0.8.41

greater than the tabulated critical F -value (F critical 
value = 2.78 at 95% confidence level) , indicating 
that the null hypothesis was  rejected in favour o f 
the alternative hypothesis.   
Due to the lack of a fitting test, the P value was 
found to be greater than the significance level (α 
= 0.05). As a result , the model was considered 
statistically significant at the 95% confidence level, and the selected model  (Eq. (9) ) was 
deemed sufficient to describe the experimental data. The coef ficients of the model are provided 
in Table 5.  The analysis of variance (ANOVA) for RB 
dye removal by CCF was presented in Table 5. 
Variables with a P
value less than 0.05 indicate that 
these terms are statistically significant.14 To 
simplify the correlatio n between the variables and 
the response, Equation (9) was reduced to a 
second -order polynomial equation, as given in 
Equation (13), by removing the insignificant 
components.

After excluding the insignificant compon ents, 
the reduced model was statistically tested using 
the analysis of variance , as shown in Table 5. The 
ANOVA result s for RB dye removal showed a 
high model F value of 40338. 90 and a smaller P value 
(<0.001). These values indicate that the reduced 
model wa s significant. On the other hand,  the 
correlation coefficient determination (R2 = 
0.99998 ) and the adjusted determination 
coefficient (R2Adj = 0.9999) were very 
satisfactory, permitting the use of the reduced 
model for optimization of RB dye removal by EF 
process.  
 
Effect of operating variable s on RB removal  
Figure 3 show s the individual effect of the 
variables. Linear constant and positive effects are  
observed for th ree variables: stirring speed ( A) 
(Fig. 3a), oxygen flow ( B) and supporting 
electrolyte ( D) (Fig. 3b and 3d), respectively. The 
constant effect observe d for stirring speed 
suggests that the RB dye removal is not affected 
by the mass transfer. However, the positive effect 
for both variable s A and B resulted from the 
improv ed current intensity and, consequently , 
enhanced RB dye removal in accordance with  
Ohm’s law. A significant amount of O 2 promotes  
the H2O2 production process , while a sufficient 
number of ions improve the solution conductivity.   
A nonlinear relationship was observed 
between the current intensity ( C) and the 
response. The efficiency of RB dye removal  
increased w ith the increase of  current intensity 
from  0.2 to 0.356 A , attributed to the electro -
regeneration of Fenton reagent’s “Fe+2 and 
H2O2”.10 However,  any further increase in the  
current intensity could decrease the RB removal 
due to the generation of ‘parasite ’ reactions of 
hydroxyl radical s, which is developed from  fast 
electrode reaction s, such as water electrolysis.14 Figure 4 illustrate s the 3D surface plots 
derived from the quadratic polynomial model of the independent variable interactions. Fig ure 4 
shows  that the stirring speed variable , in 
association with  the other variable s, exhibits a 
nonlinear effect with the oxygen flow and current 
intensity. Furthermore, the i ntense agitation 
breaks up the oxygen bubbles , increasing the 
surface  area of the bubbles and consequently 
enhancing the parasitic reactions, such as 
hydrogen peroxide oxidation at the anode (Eq.  
14), and the reduction of hydrogen peroxide at the 
cathode (Eq. 16).

However, the same behaviour of the current  
intensity effect wa s observed for the stirring speed 
and current intensity interact ion, which reveal s 
that the electrochemical reactions are not a ffected 
by the stirring speed.  Moreover , the proportional 
relation ship between  the supporting electrolyte 
concentration and stirring speed is  explained by 
the improve ment  in mass transfer. The 3D surface 
plots illustrating the interaction of current intensity with the other variables strongly depend on the evolution of the current intensity curve. 
According to Faraday’s law, the current intensity 
is proportional to the accumulation of ferrous ions 
released from the sacrificial anode and the 
reduction of Fe
3+ to Fe2+ (Eq. 4).9 Therefore, a 
higher current intensity up to 0.356 A provides 
more catalyst for the Fenton reaction. However, 
above this value, parasitic reactions may occur, 
affecting RB dy e removal.15,42

 CONCLUSION  
This study demonstrated the effectiveness of 
CCF  in developing a suitable mathematical model 
for predicting the removal of RB dye by the EF 
process. The correlation coefficient determination 
(R2 = 0.99998)  and the adjusted determination 
coefficient (R2Adj = 0.9999) , both close to 1, prove 
that the selected model is a promising tool for predicting the response accura tely. 
The CCF  analysis not only provided insights 
into the individual effects of the variable s, but 
also revealed the interactive effects through 3D 
surface plots for all pairs of variables. Among the 
variables, the current intensity factor was found to 
have a substantial effect on the production of 
Fenton reagents and, consequently, on RB dye 
removal.  
Based on the analysis, the optimal conditions 
for achieving a satisfactory RB removal 
efficiency were determined. The analysis 
estimated an adequate RB remov al efficiency of 
94.51% under the following optimized 
parameters: a stirring speed of 205.09 rpm, 
oxygen flow rate of 0.20 L/min, current intensity 
of 0.306 A, and supporting electrolyte 
concentration of 0.09 M.  Finally, t he obtained 
results illustrate the successful optimization of EF 
process parameters for efficient RB dye removal and confirm the potential of CCD as a reliable 
tool for process modelling and optimization in 
wastewater treatment applications.
