ABSTRACT 
* ： '7 
Microorganisms degrading Methyl Red or/and N,N-dimethyl-/?-phenylene 
diamine (DMPD) were isolated from dye-containing sludge and sediment, activated 
sludg
e and soil. Two bacteria, namely, Serraiia marcescens S-5 and Klebsiella 
pneumoniae RS-13, were isolated and selected for their high DMPD- and o-
aminobenzoic acid (ABA)-degrading ability, which was evaluated by Degradatioin 
Value (DV) of DMPD and ABA as selective parameters respectively, from a 
multistage selection process. 
Effects of chemical parameters such as concentration of glucose, ethanol, 
ammonium sulphate, yeast extract and phosphate buffer in cultural medium and pH 
of cultural medium; and physical parameters such as temperature and dissolved 
oxygen (i.e. shaking and static cultures) on reductive cleavage of Methyl Red, DVs 
of DMPD and ABA, and growth of S. marcescens S-5 and K. pnenmotvae RS-13, 
alon
g with Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l as a reference bacterial strain, were 
determined. 
Results in the present study indicated that the readiness of decolorization of 
Methyl Red by K. pneumoniae RS-13, S. marcescens S-5 and A. liquefaciens S-l 
was proportional to the concentration of carbon source in shaking cultures. The 
colorless culture contained decolorized Methyl Red then gradually turned into brown 
color at a rate inversely proportional to the concentration of carbon source. The 
colorless culture, however, gradually turned into purple color rather than brown 
color as formed in shaking culture. Decolorization of Methyl Red in static culture 
could be achieved at a lower concentration of carbon source. Upon further 
incubation, the purple culture gradually and finally turned into brown. This might 
indicate that DMPD immediately generated from Methyl Red was colorless, reduced 
form. This reduced form could remain long when the cultures contained high 
concentration of carbon source. The reduced form was then gradually oxidized by 
atmospheri
c oxygen into purple, oxidized form. Brown color substances in both 
ii cultures were probably degradative products of DMPD which produced more 
favourably under shaking condition and were more hydrophilic than commercial 
DMPD. 
Both K. pneumoniae RS-13 and S. marcescens S-5 could cleave 100 mg/1 
Methyl Red faster and at a greater extent than A. liquefaciens S-l in both static and 
shaking cultures supplied with 0.5 g/1 glucose. Also, both of them could cleave 
Methy
l Red when the cultures with 0.5 g/1 glucose was added with no ammonium 
sulphate or no yeast extract, very low amount of phosphate (0.01 M) and at pH 6-8. 
K. pneumoniae RS-13 had the highest DV of DMPD than the others. It 
could degrade 60-70 % DMPD generated from the reductive cleavage of 100 mg/1 
Methyl Red at 30 °C in shaking culture supplied with 0.5 g/1 glucose. However, it 
degraded ABA very poorly. S. marcescens S-5 and A. liquefaciens S-l could 
degrade DMPD and degrade ABA more readily. S. marcescens S-5 could degrade 
ABA better than A. liquefaciens S-l at low concentration of glucose and yeast 
extract. It could degrade 90-100 % ABA generated from the reductive cleavage of 
100 mg/1 of Methyl Red at 30 °C in shaking cultures supplied with 0.5 g/1 glucose. 
Degradation of DMPD by S. marcescens S-5 was greatly inhibited by the presence of 
glucose and yeast extract. In the present study, A, liquefaciens S-l was found not 
only able to degrade ABA but also DMPD, though at an lesser extent. 
The good DMPD-degrading ability of K. pneumoniae RS-13 at low level of 
carbon，nitrogen and phosphate source at pH 6-8 shown in results indicated that it is 
feasible to apply immobilized cell of this bacterium in treating Methyl Red or DMPD 
generated from reductive cleavage of other azo dyes.

xxi 1. Introduction 
Technological advancement and civilization of a society improve the standard 
of living of its people by rendering them more capable of producing products of 
multifarious and innumerable kinds satisfying their desires for living with more 
convenience and entertainment. This success cannot be accomplished without the 
broadening of knowledge and sophistication of techniques in agriculture, industry and 
medicine. This achievement not only increases man's ability in exploring and 
exploiting all possible natural resources for expanding their productivity, however, 
but also increases their power in producing wastes of great quantity and complexity 
for disposal. This concomitant boom of wastes, which is mostly synthetic and so are 
usually toxic and poorly degradable, has far exceeded the carrying capacity of the 
natural environment. Confronted with the ecologically and aesthetically deteriorating 
environment, the development of any possible and economical methods for treating 
especially the toxic and refractory wastes has become an urgent and indispensable 
wor
k for us. 
1.1 Problems of Pollution From Textile Industries 
Among all the wastes produced, industrial wastes demand the largest 
attention because they have been long regarded as being of the greatest diversity and 
toxicity and are mostly recalcitrant to the nature. For Hong Kong and many 
countries in which textile industry is prosperous, textile industry presents a major 
water pollution problem in those countries (Jones, 1973) since textile industry not 
only exhausts a large quantity of clean water for processing, but also contributes a 
significant amount of wastewater (Dasgupta and Nemerow, 1991). Also among the 
new chemical substances produced each year, which termed as pre-manufacturing 
notifications (PMNs), by different manufacturing companies that reported to the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the control of the Toxic Substances 
Contro
l Act (TSCA) in the USA, the majority are dyes used in textile industry 
1 (Figure 1) (Houk et al .，1991). The increasing potential hazard of textile wastes has 
made them become an unmistakable pollution problem to be concerned. 
The textile wastes mainly include (1) naturally occurring dirts, salts, oils and 
greases from cotton and wool, (2) chemicals added or removed during many different 
process operations e.g., mercerizing and dyeing of cotton and (3) fibers removed by 
chemical and mechanical action during processing (Jones, 1973). The materials used 
in textile industry are mainly cotton, wool and synthetic fibers (Dasgupta and 
Nemerow, 1991). These three raw fibers demand different processes in conversion 
into finished materials (Jones, 1973). The processes of these three materials (Waters, 
1984) are shown as follows: 
Cotton Wool Synthetic fibers 
Step 1 Weaving Scouring Scouring 
Step 2 Desizing Dyeing Dyeing 
Step 3 Scouring Carding Scouring 
Step 4 Bleaching Fulling Bleaching 
Step 5 Mercerizing Washing Finishing 
Step 6 Dyeing Knitting 
Step 7 Finishing Dyeing 
Step 8 Finishing 
All of these processes make use of large quantity of water and in many cases 
producing extremely polluting effluents (Waters, 1984) 
Since in many textile factories, effluents from different process are usually 
discharged through a single pipe into a municipal sewage treatment plant, textile 
wastes are overall colored, highly alkaline, high in biochemical oxygen demand

3 (BOD) and suspended solids, and high in temperature (Dasgupta and Nemerow, 
1991). 
The kind of synthetic fibers, new detergents, resins, dyestuffs and organic 
chemicals for processes such as sizing, scouring and mercerizing being introduced 
onto the textile market continuously is increasing in a rapid rate. Nearly all of them 
are more resistant than the conventional ones from microbial and chemical attacks 
(Jones, 1973). The increasing use of the synthetic materials has been changing the 
composition of textile wastewater very rapidly especially in the recent two decades. 
Waste streams which once were homogeneous and biodegradable has become more 
heterogeneous and recalcitrant. The increasing recalcitrance of textile effluent 
prevents waste mixture of domestic and textile wastes from being treated successfully 
i
n municipal sewage treatment plant as in the past. Natural fibers retained with 
sludge in the sewage treatment plant are biologically degraded whereas this is not the 
case for most synthetic fibers as they are comparatively persistent. The accumulation 
of them in a sewage treatment plant using mechanical aeration even can cause 
damag
e to pumps, pipelines and aerators, The retention time for this waste can no 
longer be as short as that for the waste of less inertness in the past. Under this 
circumstance, the mixing of industrial and municipal waste stream may even result in 
waste that is less suited for either biological or chemical treatment (Jones, 1973). 
Therefore the direct discharge of textile wastewater into conventional sewage 
treatment system not only makes the wastes unable to be treated properly, but the 
efficiency of the sewage treatment system is also adversely affected. 
In order to protect the operation of municipal sewage treatment plants and 
natural waterbodies from harmful effects of textile pollutants, isolated or integrated 
effluents from different processing operations should be pre-treated suitably by 
either physical, chemical, or biological methods or by the combinations of them 
before discharge (Jones, 1973). 
'��•., ... • • 
4 1.2 Current Treatment Methods of Wastewater from Textile Industries 
The selection of treatment methods by textile factories is based on the 
following factors.: 
(1) Quality of effluent discharged 
Requirement is different for effluents discharged into sewer and natural 
watercourse, and for reuse and recycling. Discharge to sewer involves mainly 
payment to the appropriate authority for treatment and factories themselves thus only 
need to pretreat the effluents with the conventional methods. Discharge to nearby 
watercourses is normally free but the discharger has to meet a more stringent 
requirement  and to install a more sophisticated treatment plant by himself. Effluents 
for reuse and recycling generally require additional treatment such as adsorption by 
activated carbon or reverse osmosis to render them more suitable for particular use 
(Waters, 1984). 
(2) Type of fibers 
The sources of polluting compounds are mainly the natural impurities scoured 
from the fibers and the processing chemicals such as dyes, dye additives, bleaches 
and detergents, Fibers mainly used are cotton, wool and synthetic fibers. These 
fibers require different operations and chemicals in processing and so produce 
effluents of different compositions (Dasgupta and Nemerow, 1991). 
(3) Stages of textile processing 
The process of converting raw, natural or synthetic fibers into finished 
materials involves initial fiber preparation (e.g., scouring), bleaching, dyeing and 
printing, other finishing processes (e.g., mercerizing, application of flame-resistant 
finishes) and washing at various stages. Different stages require different operation 
and chemicals and so produce effluents of different compositions (Waters, 1984). 
5 (4) Machinery employed 
From a batch-processing machine the discharge is intermittent. All the 
liquors from a given process likely come from the same machine, the first rinse is the 
most heavily contaminated and the last rinse is much more dilute. From a continuous 
process, a steady flow of effluent of moderate concentration from the rinse sections, 
with the occasional discharge of spent chemical baths which are more highly 
contaminated. The total effluent volume from the processing of a given weight of 
fiber tends to be lower with continuous than with batch wise machines (Callely et al.’ 
1977). Therefore, suitable treatments should be chosen with regard to the machinery 
used. 
(5) Scale of factory 
When a small-scale textile factory produces effluent in small amount, direct 
discharge  of this small  quantity of effluent into sewer without any pretreatment may 
be acceptable since the inhibitory components in the effluent can be diluted by the 
comparatively large quantity of domestic sewage (Waters, 1984). Also, a small-scale 
factory usually cannot afford installation of complete wastewater treatment system as 
the large-scale factory due to the limitation of budget and space. However, this can 
become more practical, manageable and cost-effective by sharing a centralized 
treatment system by a number of nearby small-scale (Hamza, 1982). 
The conventional treatment processes for the effluent generally employed by 
the dyeing factories mainly aim at the removal of BOD and suspended solids. They 
are : 
(1) Screening 
Rags and other large solids are removed as early as possible by screens 
(Waters 1984). 
(2) Flow balancing 
Firstly，the hydraulic load on the sewage treatment plant can be kept fairly 
constant. Secondly, the chemical and biological load can be kept as constant as 
possible and temperature variations smoothed. Thirdly, mixing of acidic and alkaline 
6 wastes can reduce the requirements for chemicals for neutralization. Finally, toxic 
substances that can inhibit one of the treatment processes (e.g., metals to biological 
treatment
) are diluted sufficiently that they no longer cause any problem. Sufficient 
mixing is essential and can be achieved by mechanical mixing with paddles, aeration 
or pumped recirculation (Waters, 1984), 
(3) Neutralization 
Alkaline wastes can be neutralized by mixing with acidic wastes if possible or 
by the addition of sulfuric acid or carbon dioxide in flue gas. Acidic wastes can be 
neutralized by mixing with alkaline wastes if possible or by the addition of lime for 
large flows and caustic soda for small flows (Waters, 1984). 
(4
) Sedimentation and flotation 
Settleable solids derived from materials being processed or resulting from 
precipitation after mixing or neutralizing the flows are removed by sedimentation to 
avoid blockage. Substances of density less than water such as grease and oil are 
removed by flotation (Waters, 1984). 
(5) Coagulation and sedimentation 
Coagulants such as lime, aluminum salts (especially aluminum sulphate or 
alum)
, ferric chloride, ferrous sulphate or synthetic polymers are added to remove 
not readily settleable solids and colloidal components. Coagulation has been 
considered an effective mean of reducing the color of dye-wastes and of reducing 
the BOD, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and other components of textile 
wastes. Control of pH is critical for best coagulation with different coagulants. 
Coagulants such as alum coagulates most efficiently at neutral pH. Iron salts can 
coagulate effectively over a wider pH range. Lime coagulates at high pH. The 
choice of coagulant, dose and pH can only be determined by a series of jar tests 
on representative samples of wastes. However, all coagulant additions produce a 
significant quantity of waste sludge which is generally difficult to dewater and 
require disposal. Flotation has been used as an alternative to sedimentation for 
separation of coagulated solids, such as floe, of low density (Waters, 1984). 
7 (6) Biological treatment 
Biological process is a fundamental and complete treatment for 
biodegradable components of dye-wastes. Inorganic nitrogen and phosphate are 
usually added to a minimum levels to satisfy the need of biological growth (BOD : 
N : P = 100 : 7 : 1) (Callely et al” 1977). 
(7) Filtration 
It is preferable when stringent requirements for effluent quality are 
imposed, or the effluent is to be reused or recycled (Waters, 1984). 
These pretreatments can make the compounds in the effluent more suitable 
for biological treatment except synthetic chemicals, for example, many classes of 
dyes and textile chemicals. Owing to the low biodegradability of these synthetic 
chemicals, they are not successfully removed by biological treatment (Callely et 
al., 1977). Filtration does not satisfactorily treat the dissolved dyes and chemicals 
v 
in effluents. In fact the most obvious impact of textile effluents discharged to a 
watercours
e is the color that it often imparts (Waters, 1984). 
In order to remove these synthetic chemicals in the effluents, alternatives to 
conventional methods for the specific removal of dyes and other chemicals are 
developed. They are: 
(1) Flocculation 
It involves using organic polymers, which act as flocculants with linear 
structure of long-chain and high molecular weight, to form bridges between 
separat
e particles and results in agglomerates. It is the simplest procedure with the 
availability of a suitable flocculating agent (Callely et al” 1977). 
(2) Activated carbon adsorption 
Since it is a great concern in textile industry to increase the adsorption onto 
th
e fabrics being dyed, adsorption of dyes onto suitable materials is considered a 
feasible mean of removing them from effluents. Activated carbon is the most 
commonly used adsorbent. It can be used in granular or powdered form. The 
common practice is to use granular activated carbon in columns. Typical contact 
8 ‘ ：•  • / 
time ranges from a few minutes to 30 minutes. It can work as a moving bed in 
which fresh carbon is continuously added to the top of the column while the 
effluent is flowing upwards. Spent activated carbon is withdrawn from the bottom 
at the same rate as that of the addition of the fresh activated carbon. The 
preference of using granular activated carbon to powdered carbon is that exhausted 
granular activated carbon can be regenerated by carbonizing the materials 
adsorbed on the carbon in furnace under carefully controlled conditions and there 
is no requirement for solid waste disposal. The loss of carbon during regeneration 
is between 5 to 10 %. In general, high-molecular-weight  and non-polar 
compounds are more effectively removed than low-molecular-weight or polar 
compounds by activated carbon (Waters, 1984). 
(3) Adsorbents other than activated carbon 
Basic dyes have been reported to be adsorbed on to silica gel and fuller's 
earth. Dyes are also adsorbed on activated alumina, peat, wood, clay and 
synthetic polymers. The relative merits of these different materials have been 
compared and activated carbon showed the highest adsorption capacity for most of 
dyes studied. Activated carbon was more expensive than peat or wood (but 
cheaper than silica). However, the ability of activated carbon to be regenerated 
makes
 it superior than other absorbents. Although, peat and wood could be burnt 
as fuel, these alternative adsorbents are unlikely to be widely used unless they are 
found both uniquely suitable and available locally at favorable cost (Waters, 
1984). 
(4) Chemical oxidation 
It can destroy the color of dyes and oxidize other materials. The resultant 
oxidation products may be more biodegradable and therefore amenable to 
conventional treatment (Waters, 1984). 
i) Chlorination 
Chlorine and sodium hypochlorite are effective in decolorizing some dyes. 
Both chemicals are relatively cheap and are often used in textile factories for 
9 treatment of effluents. However, oxidation with chlorine may not be 
environmentally acceptable as most chlorinated products may be more toxic than 
th
e dyes to the environment (Waters, 1984). 
ii) Ozonation 
Ozone is one of the strongest oxidizing agents that are likely to be used in 
and dyeing effluent treatment plant. However the production of ozone is 
expensive. Good mixing and control of bubble size are important for increasing 
the efficiency. Also, since ozone is toxic and corrosive gas, residual ozone should 
be destroyed properly. In view of the high cost and potential toxicity involved, 
ozonation is usually applied as a final treatment after most of the potential oxygen 
deman
d has been reduced (Waters, 1984). 
(5) Electrolytic separation 
It is more effective in treating concentrated effluents. It is more specific 
for removal of dyes than of other wastes components (Callely et al., 1977). 
(6) Ion exchange resin 
Chemicals carrying charges can be removed by passing the effluent over an 
appropriate solid ion exchanger. The targeted chemicals can replace the hydrogen 
ions or hydroxide ions of the appropriate exchangers. The cation exchanger is 
regenerated with strong acid while the anion exchanger with strong base 
(Manahan, 1984). Both cation and anion exchangers can also be regenerated by 
methanol. The advantage of it is that methanol can be distilled off and reused, 
leaving a concentrated residues for disposal. 
(7) Reverse osmosis 
It is also known as hyperfiltration which acts through a semipermeable 
membrane that only allows passage of water molecules but not other materials in 
the effluent (Manahan, 1984), Up to 95% water can be recovered in this process 
(Waters, 1984). 
Of the above seven methods, the most promising methods are adsorption 
by activated carbon or others, and chemical oxidation (Callely et al” 1977).

10 In many factories, effluents with high BOD and suspended solids are 
produced from early stages of dyeing and final stages of finishing. For these 
effluents
, treatment has to be integrated at some stages. However, there may be 
more advantageous and economical if it is possible to isolate and treat some of the 
stronger
, difficult and more heavily colored effluents individually before mixing 
with the rest for the final treatment and discharge (Callely et alt 1977; Waters, 
1984). 
On the other hand, dilution of effluents of high BOD loading with 
components of flow that are relatively clean, e.g., wastewater derived from 
rinsing operation, may be beneficial for biological treatment from the points of 
view of reducing high organic loading on the plant and of diluting inhibitory 
substances (Waters, 1984). 
1.3 Adverse Effects of Dyes on the Environment 
Since the discovery of the first synthetic dye, aniline purple (mauveine), by 
W.H. Perkin in 1856, the commercial development of a vast of synthetic colorants 
both for textile and non-textile application had been undertaken pervasively (Peters 
and Freeman, 1991). With the insatiable demand by man for color in his 
surroundings, his clothes and other artifacts, the naturally occurring colorants have 
already became unable to satisfy these purposes. Natural colorants generally require 
a mordant for satisfactory application and their performances, availability and range 
are very limited. They have become too limited to be compared with synthetic dyes 
an
d pigments, which can be manufactured readily from a wide range of primary and 
intermediates products originated from coal tar and petrochemicals to result in a 
great variety of dye products (Holme, 1984). In addition, synthetic dyes possessed a 
larger range of tailored properties and a more favorable cost versus benefit ratio 
compared to the natural dyes. The latter were almost totally ousted by the beginning 
of 20th century in many industries (Griffiths, 1984; Peters and Freeman, 1991). 
11 Coupling with the prosperity of textile factory in many countries and that the 
textile market demands better performance of dyestuffs, synthetic dyes which are 
more resistant to ozone, nitric oxides, light, hydrolysis and other degradative 
environments have captured a valuable portion of the commercial market, the 
manufacture, production and consumption of synthetic dyes are so great that there 
were up to 10 % of the submissions of PMNs each year are for synthetic dyes since 
the TSCA had been enacted (Figure 2) (Houk et al., 1991). Concerning that the 
chemical structure of a compound is a major factor in determining its harm to the 
human health, the substructures of chemical substances that have been identified to 
carry potential hazards to human beings are shown in Figure 3. 
The discharge of dyes into the aquatic environment (sea, rivers etc.) may arise 
from three main sources: (1) from dye manufacturers; (2) from dye users, e.g., 
industrial coloration of textile and paper etc. and (3) from diffuse or household 
discharges as a result of the leaching dyes from manufactured products (Holme, 
1984)
. The recalcitrant property makes dyestuffs in the waste effluent not likely to 
be degraded biologically in municipal sewage treatment plants. Although the non-
biodegraded dyes may be absorbed by the sludge in an activated sludge process, the 
problem still exists if the sludge is not handled properly for ultimate disposal in order 
to prevent further contamination (Jones, 1973). 
As one of the properties of dyes is their high color value, the treated sewage 
containing non-biodegraded dyes causes the receiving water-course to be highly 
colored (Waters, 1984)，which would normally observable at about 1 mg/1 level 
which is unacceptable on aesthetic grounds (Holme, 1984). The color not only 
affects the aquatic environment aesthetically but also the growth and physiological 
activities of aquatic flora and fauna by reducing the light penetration into the water.

14 The factors should be considered to assess the risk of persons exposed to 
colorants include: (1) the total exposure potential; (2) the seriousness of the toxic 
effect and (3) the fact or the probability of its occurrence. It is undoubtedly that 
people working in factories in dyestufF production and processing have very great 
hazard because their long exposure to a large quantity of synthetic dyes, which most 
of them have been gradually confirmed to be toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic. The 
acute oral toxicity (LD50) studies on the rat of 4461 commercial dyestuffs indicated 
that for 92 % of these products generally have low acute toxicity observed even for a 
singl
e administration. Basic dyestuffs showed a significantly higher occurrence in 
lower LD$q ranges. Short period tests with repeated doses (10-90 days) have shown 
that dyes intended for use in food or cosmetics such as azo dyes of the acid, direct 
and solvent classes and also triphenylmethane acid dyes gave medium to sub-chronic 
toxicity. Only a few products have no observable effect at the level of <25 mg/kg. 
The possible chronic effects which are of interest in relation to dyestuffs are 
carcinogenicity and to a lesser extent sensitization. When hazardous intermediates 
have been positively identified as carcinogens, dyestufF production based on these 
intermediates�such  as benzidine, has been abandoned in the UK and the USA 
(Holme, 1984). Mutagenicity testing of dyestuffs using the short term 
5a/wo/?e//a/mammalian microsome assay developed (Ames, 1975) has been studied. 
However, at present, none of the short term toxicity tests are completely reliable as 
indicators for carcinogenicity of dyes. Mutagenic activity has been reported for most 
carcinogenic azo dyes of the p-dimethylaminoazo-benzene series, and for many 
anthraquinone derivatives and dyestuffs (Holme, 1984). 
Owing to that trace quantities of heavy metal ions such arsenic, cadmium, 
cobalt and mercury are used as catalysts in many commercial dyes ； and chromium, 
copper and nickel are used in formation of anionic metal-complex dyes, the discharge 
of these waste effluents can exert an inhibitory action on the bacteria in biological 
treatment plant (Holme, 1984). 
».» .‘. ’ ... 
• .... �  . 15 A survey of the available toxicity data of fish over 3000 commercial dyestufFs 
indicated that about 98 % of tested dyestufFs had LC50 (Lethal Concentration - 50 % 
kill) values greater than 1 mg/1. Detailed studies of the effect of chemical structure in 
aminoanthraquinone dyes on the fathead minnow {Pimephales promelas) confirmed 
that basic dyes were more toxic to fish (Holme, 1984). 
A study of the effects of 56 selected dyestufFs on the growth of the green 
alga, Selenastrum capricormitam, showed close parallels with the relative toxicities 
exhibited in toxicity studies of fish. However, many of the acid dyes, while not 
significantly inhibiting algal growth, did exhibit high toxicity to fish. In addition, the 
results indicated a strong correlation between dyestuff basicity and growth inhibition 
of the alga (Holme, 1984). 
A study to monitor the toxicity of dyestuffs on the respiration rates of sludge 
indicated that about 10 % of the total 202 dyestufFs tested showed an inhibitory 
effect on an aerobic wastewater treatment system when present at a high level 
(Waters, 1984). 
Chung et al. (1981) also reported that some commonly used dyes and their 
metabolites or derivatives were tested to be mutagenic using Salmonella-msimmalmn 
microsome mutagenicity test. � 
The large number of dyes, and the high potential for toxicity of dyes and dye 
compound
s have made this class of compounds one of the most extensively reviewed 
and regulated under the TSCA new chemical programs (Houk et a/” 1991). The 
pollution problems arising from dyestufFs wastes therefore deserve more efforts to be 
handled and dealt with. 
1.4 Classification of Dyes 
Colorants can be classified as naturally occurring or synthetic (man-made or 
artificial) compounds. They may be dyes or pigments. These two colorants are 
totally different things. Pigments may be white, black or colored and are 
16 • •�-  ,� 
characterized by having low solubility in most solvents. They are used in particulate 
form and have to be attached or applied to substrates by mechanical means (Griffiths, 
1984). Dyes are usually readily soluble substances. From the textile application 
point of view, they usually have an inherent affinity for a polymeric substance, which 
permits their selective uptake from solution. The affinity is of less relevance in non-
textile applications. The textile industry is the principal user of dyes compared to 
other industries (Griffiths, 1984). 
Dyes can be classified by different methods. For dye users, dyes are 
classified by properties and applications (Figure 4), However, for chemists, dyes are 
classified into 10 to 20 classes by means of their chromophores, the characteristic 
structural unit for a particular dye class which have absorption in the visible region 
(Figure  5) (Giles, 1971; Meyer, 1981). 
1.5 Azo Dyes 
Among the many classes synthetic dyes used in various industries, azo dyes 
are the largest and the most versatile one and play prominent role in almost every 
type of application from the structural point of view. Azo dyes are cost effective 
because of their ease and versatility of synthesis and relatively higher tinctorial 
strength than other synthetic dyes (Griffiths, 1984). 
Azo dyes are a group of compounds characterized by the presence of one or 
more azo groups (N=N) in association with one or more aromatic systems. Azo 
dyes are named as monoazo, disazo, trisazo, tetrakisazo and polyazo dyes according 
to the number of azo groups present in the dye molecule (Abrahart, 1968; Johnson, 
1978). 
In 1855, Peter Griess synthesized the first azo dye soon after he had 
discovered and elucidated the diazotization reaction, a reaction by which azo dyes

Figure 5. Classification of synthetic organic colorants by chromophores (Meyer, 1981) 
19 are made almost exclusively nowadays. Azo dye formation is based on two basic 
reactions
: diazotization and coupling (Abrahart, 1968; Johnson, 1978). 
In diazotization, a primary aromatic amine is converted into a diazo or 
diazoniu
m salt. This diazo compound, which can be made from practically every 
primary aromatic amine, is then coupled with a second substance which can be any 
compound that possesses an active hydrogen atom bound to a carbon atom. These 
second substances may be compounds that possess phenolic hydroxyl groups, such as 
phenols and naphthols, aromatic amines or compounds, that possess enolizable 
ketone groups of an aliphatic character (i.e., compounds that have active methylene 
groups). 
The diazotization reaction is given below: 
Ar NH2 + 2HX + NaN02 -> Ar.N2+ X" + NaX + 2H20 
where Ar = an aromatic hydrocarbon radical and X = CI, Br, NO3, HSO4, BF4, etc. 
The coupling reaction is then followed: 
Ar N2+X- + HR-> Ar-N=NR + HX 
where R is alkyl or aryl group (Catino and Farris, 1985). 
Chemically, the azo dyes are subdivided, as mentioned above, according to 
the number of azo groups present in the molecule. Mono- and disazo dyes are 
essentially common and important in industrial use, Relatively, trisazo and 
tetrakisazo dyes are less important (Catino and Farris, 1985). 
Since there are many combinations to choose substrates for diazotization and 
coupling reactions, together with the variation of number of azo groups present in a 
dye molecule, azo dyes virtually cover the whole spectrum and the production of 
brighter color and further extension of color range can be made possible (Hallas, 
1984). Nowadays azo dyes account for more than a half of the total of disperse dyes 
used in industries. They are widely used for dyeing all natural substrates such as 
cotton, paper, silk, leather, and wool as well as the synthetics, such as polyamides, 
polyesters, acrylics, polyoefins, viscose rayon, cellulose acetate, etc. Azo dyes are 
also for the coloring of paints, varnishes, plastics, printing inks, rubber, food, drugs, 
20 cosmetics, and for staining polished and absorbed surfaces. They are also used  in 
diaz
o printing and color photography. Types of azo dyes include acid dyes, azoic 
dyes, fast color salts，disperse azo dyes, oil-soluble azo dyes, spirit-soluble azo dyes 
and azo pigments (Catino and Farris, 1985). 
Th
e widespread use of azo dyes can be seen from that the majority of PMNs 
of the major color-forming groups are for mono- and disazo textile dyes (Figure 6). 
Therefore, the stringent control actions were also put on azo dyes. The percentage 
of control action taken was 24 % (Houk etal., 1991). 
1.6 Metabolisms of Azo Dyes in Microbial and Animal Systems 
The versatile application of azo dyes has initiated many studies their inhibitory 
effects on human and the environment when the azo dye-containing effluents are 
discharged without suitable treatment. The increase in occurrence of intestinal 
cancer in highly industrialized society further aroused people to concern the possible 
connection between the decreases and the increasing use of azo dyes (Chung et al., 
1978). 
The First study of mammalian metabolism of azo dyes was by Sisley and 
Porscher in 1911. They discovered the reductive cleavage of azo group in Orange I 
(C.I. Acid Orange 20) when fed to dogs (Meyer, 1981). 
From the early studies of oral administration of many azo dyes to laboratory 
animals, most of the dyes were reduced to primary amines. Azo reduction was found 
not a typical drug-metabolizing reaction like most oxidative hepatic detoxicating 
mechanisms because azo reduction was found in liver of neonatal mice before hepatic 
detoxification enzymes had developed. This azo reduction appeared in most species 
of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibia and fish. This activity was detected in liver, 
lung, kidney, intestine and placenta but seemed to be highest in liver. It was found 
that the major role of reduction was played by intestinal microflora (Gingell and 
Walker, 1971).

22 Using rat gut bacterial suspensions, starved Proteus suspension or its cell-free 
extract, Roxon et al. (1967) found that azo dyes, such as w-Methyl Orange, 
Neoprontosil
, Tartrazine, Yellow 2G, Amaranth, Proceau SX, Fast Yellow, 
Naphthalene Fast Orange 2G and Sunset Yellow FCF, can be reduced by rat gut 
bacteria
l suspension to different extents and at different rates. In case of 
azonaphthols, bacterial system appeared more efficient than rat-liver homogenates to 
reduce azo dyes. Study of thin-layer chromatography of the supernatants containing 
the above dyes incubated with either gut bacterial suspensions, starved Proteus 
suspension or the cell-free extracts showed that some dyes had been reduced to 
amines. Together with further work on Tartrazine reduction, they believed that azo 
dyes could act as alternate electron acceptors for the respiratory chain. The Proteus 
enzyme which reduced Tartrazine was a flavoprotein requiring FMN (flavin 
mononucleotide) and NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
phosphate) for reduction to take place. 
It was because the addition of soluble flavins could stimulate both bacterial 
and mammalian hepatic azo-reductase activities, Gingell and Walker (1971) used the 
established NADH-generating system incorporating in the standard assay procedure 
to study the azo-reductase activity of preparation of cell-free extracts of 
Streptococcus faecalis under optimal conditions. They found that flavins (e.g., 
FMN) added in the preparations were initially reduced enzymically by the crude 
enzymes in the presence of NADH-generating system. They then rapidly and non-
enzymically reduced azo dye, Red 2G, 
into the primary amines. The reduced flavins were then oxidized in the process. 
Without FMN, NADH reduced Red 2G very slowly if at all. This azo reduction 
process would more likely be a double two-electron transfer via the hydrazo 
intermediate (R~~NH~HNR') under anaerobic condition : 
FMNH2 + R—N=N—R' — FMN + R—NH—HN—R' 
FMNH2 + R—NH—HN—R' -> FMN + R—NH2 + H2N—R' 
23 Since there was no enzyme-substrate complex formed between the bacterial 
azo reductase and Red 2G, it showed that FMN is the true substrate of the bacterial 
azo reductase, being reduced by flavoproteins, and then reduced the dyes non-
enzymically. This indirect mechanism of azo reduction would explain why both 
,bacterial and mammalian hepatic preparations could reduce a wide range of azo dyes. 
The
y also found that under aerobic conditions, the azo dye acts as another electron 
shuttl
e from reduced flavin to oxygen (Gingell and Walker, 1971). 
Beside
s the nature of reducing agents could influence azo compounds, the 
molecular parameters influencing the ease with which electrons are accepted by the 
azo group also could do so. This was proved by the study done by Walker and Ryan 
(1971) about the reduction of a series of analogues of the Red 10G and Red 2G 
(Figure  7) by the cell-free extracts of Streptococcus faecalis. They found that 
reduction rate can be lowered by facilitating the localization of electron density in the 
region of azo groups by any substitution with electron donating group or by 
stabilizing of hydroxyl group adjacent to the azo group. When hydroxyl group is 
free, i.e. not stabilized, it will form H-bond with azo nitrogen and so the electron 
density of azo bond is lowered. 
The study of the reduction rates of a number of water-soluble azo dyes 
measured in cell culture of Proteus vulgaris showed that there was linear relationship 
between reduction rate of azo dyes and their concentrations as well as their redox 
potentials (Dubin and Wright, 1975). These results indicated that the bacterial 
reduction of azo dyes might not involve selective membrane permeation or enzyme 
binding
. Dubin and Wright (1975) proposed that this was an extracellular 
(presumably non-enzymic) dye reduction and the rate of which was thus controlled 
by a process independent of dye concentration. Moreover, the results that there was 
an increase in dye reduction rate when cell died might show that lysis of cells in death

25 phase rendered the cellular enzymes more accessible to the extracellular reducing 
agents. 
Larsen et al (1976) reported that azo dyes substituted with more electron-
withdrawin
g groups, e.g., sulphonate groups, were not reduced faster than those 
wit
h fewer as expected. This discrepancy to the postulation described previously was 
thought to be due to the different ability of the compounds, with higher degree of 
sulphonation and thus higher degree of ionization, to penetrate the bacterial cell-wall 
to allow themselves to be reduced. 
Chung et al. (1978) reported that for the anaerobes, all of them reduce one or 
more of seven azo dyes (Amaranth, Ponceau SX, Allura Red, Sunset Yellow, 
Tartrazine, Orange II and Methyl Orange) into aromatic amines. Reduction was 
optimal in pH 7.4 to 8.5 and was inhibited by as low as 1 mM glucose. The 
reduction could be enhanced by the presence of electron carriers other than FMN, 
e.g., methyl viologen and benzyl viologen. These results suggested that an 
extracellular shuttle (i.e., electron carrier) may be required for reduction. 
The azo reduction of sulfonazo III catalyzed by rat hepatic microsomal 
NADPH-cytochrome c reductase under aerobic and anaerobic condition showed that 
azoreductase transferred one electron to the dye to form the azo anion radical 
metabolite under anaerobic condition (Figure 8). This radical can disproportionately 
give the corresponding hydrazine or reduce oxygen under aerobic condition to 
superoxide. The superoxide may be responsible for the oxygen inhibition of 
azoreductases (Mason et al., 1978). 
Huan
g et al (1979) found that azoreductase activity also occurred in hepatic 
cytosol, which differed from the microsomal azo-reductase in several aspects (Table 
0-

The reduction of Methyl Red by cytosolic azoreductase showed that the 2'-
carbonyl group is essential for the azo-reduction (Huang et al., 1979). 
Idaka  et al. (1980) found  that azo reductase preparation of Bacillus subtilis 
can degrade p-aminobenzene into aniline and /?-phenylenediamine as the intact cells 
do. 
Renton (1980) found that there were differences in Methyl Red azo reductase 
activity in the microsomal and cytosol fraction and in the extent to be induced by 3-
methylcholanthrene among rat, mouse, guinea-pig, rabbit, hamster and sheep. 
Brown (1981) found that intestinal bacteria could reduce high-molecular-
weigh
t polymeric derivatives of certain azo dyes at rates comparable with those of 
the low-molecular-weight parental compounds. Further study on azo reduction by 
intestinal bacteria and their enzyme extracts indicated that the ability to reduce 
polymeric azo dyes was not limited to some particular intestinal microflora and 
could be stimulated by a variety of low-potential electron carriers especially flavins 
(Brown, 1981), The azo reduction of bacterial cell-free extracts containing 
27 Y�� Jvc—X,

radicals, which precedes the formation of the hydrazine intermediate (Mason et al., 
1978) 
28 NADH-generating system and benzyl viologen, an electron carrier, showed that this 
process became slow under either aerobic or anaerobic condition when this mediator 
was absent. Rapid reduction of high-molecular-weight azo dyes still occurred in cell 
suspension showed that there was the presence of natural mediators or extracellular 
reducing enzymes or both for reduction. 
Some widely used azo dyes such as Direct Black 38, a benzidine-based azo 
dye, has been proven to be mutagenic and carcinogenic due to one of its degradative 
products, benzidine, which has long been recognized as human urinary carcinogen 
and turmorigen in several kinds of laboratory animals. In view of this, Manning et al 
(1985) used a semi-continuous culture inoculated with freshly voided human faeces 
incubated over a protracted period simulating lumen of the human large intestine in 
place of monoculture or simple bacterial suspensions to investigate the possible fate 
of this dye in human. They discovered that there were deamination and acetylation 
of benzidine after reduction by the complex microbial community (Manning et al, 
1985). 
With regards to the differences of azoreductases present in rat hepatic 
preparation in the sensitivity to oxygen and carbon monoxide, response to inducing 
agents and specific requirements for electron-donating and withdrawing substituted 
substrate, Zbaida and Levine (1990) characterized two class of cytochrome P450 
azoreductase. One class of reductase reduced O2- and CO-sensitive substrates 
whereas the other one reduces O2- and CO- insensitive substrates (dyes which are 
sensitive to O2 and CO during reduction are O2- and CO-sensitive substrates while 
thos
e which are insensitive are O2- and CO-insensitive substrates). The O2-
sensitivity seemed irrelevant to the lipid solubility of the substrates, but the structure 
and kinds of substitsuent groups of the compounds which control the extent of 
electron delocalization of the free radicals produced from reduction, determine the 
stability of the radicals towards oxidation by O2. They also found that cytochrome 
^450 played a more important role in reduction of insensitive substrates than the 
sensitive ones (Zbaida and Levine, 1990). 
29 Rafii et al. (1990) examined human intestinal microflora using nondenaturing 
polyacrylamid
e gel electrophoresis and found that each bacterial isolate which could 
carry out azo reduction contained only one azoreductase. There were at least three 
types of azoreductases produced by these bacterial isolates. All enzymes could be 
inactivated by oxygen, They observed that the culture supernatants of all bacterial 
isolates had more enzymes than the cell lysate pellets did. This indicated that these 
azoreductase
s were produced constitutively and secreted extracellularly. 
From the above studies one could conclude that azo reduction occurred in 
liver and intestinal microorganisms (Gingell and Walker, 1971; Roxon et al” 1967; 
Chung et al” 1978; Mason et al, 1978; Huang et cd .，1979; Renton, 1980; Brown, 
1981; Manning et cd” 1985; Zbaida and Levine, 1990 and Rafii et al., 1990) and the 
reductio
n most probably required the cytochrome P45o-dependent azo reductases 
(Huang et al.’ 1979; Zbaida and Levine, 1990) which enzymically produce reduced 
FMN (Gingell and Walker, 1971; Chung et al, 1978; Mason et al, 1978; Brown, 
1981). The reduced FMN can be excreted extracellularly (Dubin and Wright, 1975; 
Chung et al., 1978; Brown, 1981; Rafii et al., 1990) and non-enzymically reduce the 
azo dyes (Gingell and Walker, 1971; Dubin and Wright, 1975; Mason et al, 1978) 
of higher redox potential (Dubin and Wright, 1975) to aromatic amines (Roxon et 
al, 1967; Gingell and Walker, 1971; Chung et al., 1978; Idaka et al, 1980; Manning 
et al., 1986) via formation of azo anion radicals (Gingell and Walker, 1971; Mason et 
al‘, 1978 and Zbaida and Levine, 1990). The substitsuent groups of a dye determine 
the stability of its radical towards oxidation by oxygen under aerobic condition 
(Zbaida and Levine, 1990). This stability determines the O2 sensitivity of a dye 
(Zbaida and Levine, 1990). Since superoxide formed from oxidation of the radical by 
oxygen may inhibit azo reductase (Mason et al., 1978)，it is also believed that the 
different abilities of the hepatic and microbial preparations to tolerate superoxide may 
also determine their different extents of O2 sensitivity of azo reduction activities. 
30 1.7 Toxicity, Mutagenicity and Carcinogenicity of Azo Dyes 
Since many azo dyes have been known to be reduced by hepatic systems of 
laboratory animals and by their intestinal microorganisms in vitro and in vivo, the 
harmful effects - toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity • of the dyes and their 
degradation products, which are hazardous to workers and consumers who came in 
contact with these compounds, initiated studies accounting for this issue. 
Chung et al (1981) studied the mutagenicity of azo dyes (Allura Red, 
Amaranth, Ponceau R, Ponceau SX, Sunset Yellow, Tartrazine, Methyl Yellow, 
Orange II，4-Phenylazo-1 -naphthylamine, Lithol Red, Methyl Red) and their 
metabolites and derivatives including 4-Amino-1 -naphthalene-sulfanic sodium salt, 1-
Amino-2-naphthol hydrochloride, Aniline, Anthranilic acid, Cresidine salt, 
Pyrazolone T, R-amino salt (l-amino-2-naphthol-3，6-disulfanic disodium salt), R-
salt，Schaeffer's salt (2-naphthol-6-sulfonic sodium salt), Sodium naphthionate, 
sulfanilamide and sulfanilic acid, N,N-Dimethyl-/?-phenylene diamine, 4-

by .Sa/wo^Z/a-mammalian microsome mutagenicity test using Salmonella 
typhinmrium tester strain TA 1535, TA 1537, TA 1538，TA 98 and TA 100. Results

32 Azo dye derivative 1 -Amino-2-naphthol hydrochloride was particularly toxic 
to bacteria. Ponceau R and R-amino salt were slightly mutagenic without metabolic 
activation
, but did not meet the criterion for a mutagen. 
Both Lithol Red and Methyl Yellow were moderately mutagenic and about 
equal potent when liver enzymes were added. Orange II was of extremely low 
mutagenic potency as the addition of S9 inactivated the compound. 
The most mutagenic derivatives and azo dyes, which required S9 activation, 
were N,N-Dimethyl-/?-phenyIene diamine and 2,4-Dimethylaniline, and Methyl Red, 
4-Aminopyrazolone and 4-Phenylazo-1 -naphthylamine respectively. 
Methyl Red, Methyl Orange and Methyl Yellow can be reduced to N,N-
Dimethyl-/?-phenylene diamine by the activity of azo-reductase. In the experiment, 
the S9 liver microsomes were active in the reduction Methyl Red but inactive to 
Methyl Orange and Methyl Yellow. The result suggested that the mutagenicity of 
Methyl Red was due to N,N-Dimethyl-/?-phenylene diamine produced from azo 
reduction. Incubated with anaerobic bacterium Fusobacterium sp. 2，Methyl Yellow 
was converted into N,N-Dimethyl-/?-phenylene diamine, which can be metabolically 
activated to a mutagen. 
Since many studies on the fate of azo dyes oral administered into laboratory 
animal
s showed that most of the dyes were reduced by liver and intestinal microflora, 
the role of azo reduction in the mutagenesis and carcinogenesis was extensively 
studied by Chung (1983). In addition, it was found that intestinal cancer has become 
more common in highly industrialized countries in which azo dyes are widely used. 
Chung (1983) reported that most of azo dyes, such as Tiypan Blue, Ponceau 3R, 
Ponceau 2R, Methyl Red, Methyl Yellow, Methyl Orange, Lithol Red, Orange I， 
Orange II，4-Phenylazo-1 -naphthylamine, Sudan I, Sudan IV, Acid Alizarin Red B, 
Acid Alizarin Violet N, Fast Garnet GBC, Direct Black 38, Chrysoidine，and nitro 
azo dyes such as Acid Alizarin Yellow R, Alizarin Yellow GG, become mutagenic 
with chemical reduction, microsomal activation or microbial activation. All these 
dyes produced mutagenic products from reduction. The reduction of azo dyes in 
»\ ' • /�  - .* . 
33 liver was considered much less important than that in intestine. It was because the 
intestine is filled with bacteria, mostly anaerobes, which are of great variety and 
undoubtedl
y apt in reducing a wide variety of azo compounds non-specifically into 
mutagenic (or carcinogenic) aromatic amines. This hypothesis, which was supported 
b
y results obtained by Chung et al (1981), was that Methyl Red, Methyl Orange and 
Methyl Yellow could all be reduced by intestinal anaerobes to mutagenic N，N-
dimethyl-/?-phenylene diamine (DMPD) whereas only Methyl Red could also be 
converted into DMPD by microsomal activation. Therefore, azo-reduction, which is 
the most important metabolic reaction of azo dyes, is believed to play a vital role in 
the mutagenesis or/and carcinogenesis of these dyes. 
The potential carcinogenicity of the phenylazoaniline dyes aroused many 
studies to investigate the relation of the structure of this group of dyes to their 
carcinogenicity. Rosenkranz and Klopman (1989) used the CASE (Computer-
Automated Structure Evaluation) methodology to predict the mutagenicity of a 
phenylazoanilin
e dye. The principle of the CASE is by acquiring the individual 
mutagenicity of each possible structural fragment (2-12 atoms accompanied by their 
hydrogens) that is embedded in the complete dye molecule in comparison with the 
database to calculate the overall mutagenicity of the dyes. They found that there 
appeared to be no correlation between the ability of this azo dye to be reduced and 
it
s mutagenicity and/or carcinogenicity. Firstly, for the phenylazoaniline dye, Butter 
Yellow, they could not find the presence of major structural fragments to be 
mutageni
c in either the corresponding hydrazine and the aromatic amines, but only in 
the intact azo dye. Secondly, the fragments that responsible for the major 
mutagenicity of azo dyes were found to be different from those involved in 
azoreduction as sulfonation inhibits mutagenicity but not reduction. They found that 
sulfonation destroyed the structure of the fragments and so lowered their 
manifestatio
n of mutagenicity. Therefore Rosenkranz and Klopman (1989) 
disproved the early rationale that the decreased harmful effect of Butter Yellow by 
sulfonation did not reduce its carcinogenicity but discouraged its intestinal 
34 absorption. They believed that the accuracy and reliability of this method in 
predicting the mutagenicity of compounds was assured because it could correctly 
predict the mutagenicity of 43 of 46 chemicals that were recognized to be mutagenic 
by Salmotiella-microsome mutagenicity test. Instead of using current animal 
bioassays and Salmonella-mlcrosome mutagenicity test to identify the potential 
carcinogenicity of a new compound, CASE could serve to be a practical tool to 
predic
t its mutagenicity. In addition, sulphonation can decrease the mutagenicity of a 
dye by destroying its fragment responsible for mutagenicity. They deemed that it 
could give the dye manufacturers the guidelines to make dyes having the lowest risk 
of carcinogenicity by suitably sulphonating the dyes at the position that inhibits its 
carcinogenicity (Rosenkranz and Klopman, 1989). 
However, when they studied structural basis of the mutagenicity of 1-amino-
2-naphthol-based azo dyes, they found that the mutagenicity of these dyes depended 
on azo reduction, i.e. the conversion into the corresponding aromatic amines which 
are mutagenic (Rosenkranz and Klopman, 1990). 
1.8 Removal of Azo Dyes 
1.8.1 Biological Methods 
a. Adsorption on Activated Sludge 
It has long been known that synthetic dyes are poorly degraded in biological 
waste treatment systems because of their recalcitrance. The plenty discharge of dye-
containing industrial effluents into the wastewater treatment systems has initiated 
many studies on the fate of these dyes and the treatment efficiency of activated 
sludge process on these substances. 
Urushigawa and Yonezawa (1977) examined the biodegradability of 31 water 
soluble and water slightly soluble azo dyes at 50 mg/1 by 1000 mg/1 of sludge in 100 
35 ml culture medium under shaking condition. They found that biodegradation was 
limited to azo reduction and the decolorization was readily with hydroxyl or amino 
group, not readily with methyl group and hardly with hydrogen, chloro, methoxy, 
nitro group. Also, it was found that carboxy group itself, similar to sulfonyl group, 
decreased reduction because of its hydrophilicity. 
They also found that substitution of electron-withdrawing groups (-SO3H，-
SO2NH2) did not increase the reduction as expected by Gingell and Walker (1971). 
They speculated that this may be due to that higher 50 % growth inhibition 
concentration of dyes led to their lower decolorizability. 
The low BOD:COD ratio (<0.1) of majority of textile effluent leads to low 
biodegradability of dyes in them. Dohanyos et al (1978) reported that dyes that were 
partially removed in biological treatment was attributed to adsorption onto the 
activated sludge floes. This adsorption included exchange adsorption, Van der Waals 
forces
, hydrogen bridges, etc. The adsorption of basic dyes increased with pH and 
the opposite effect was observed for acidic dyes. They reported that dye adsorption 
is mainly dependent on type, chemical composition, structure of dyes, structure of 
adsorbent surface, pH and salinity, etc, 
Hitz et al. (1978) studied the adsorption of azo dyes onto activated sludge 
floes and made some comments, which are very useful in selecting treatment of 
effluent containing dyes: 
(1) Acid dyes : 
High solubility leads to poor adsorption. These features are partly dependent 
on the number of sulfonyl groups. 
(2) Reactive dyes : 
Very poor adsorption occurs. This is neither related to number of sulfonyl 
group
s nor to the ease by which the dyes are hydrolyzed. 
(3) Direct dyes : 
Good adsorption occurs. This is not related to the number of sulfonyl 
groups. 
36 ‘•  \ ‘ ： ‘ ‘ • . 
(4) Disperse dyes ： 
Good to moderate adsorption occurs. 
(5) Basic dyes : 
Good adsorption occurs. 
Although the possible removal mechanisms for a dye compound in the 
activated sludge system include adsorption, biodegradation, chemical transformation, 
photodegradation and air stripping, Shaul et al. (1991) found that adsorption and/or 
biodegradation appeared to be the major removal mechanisms. The fate of azo dyes 
tha
t they studied are summarized as follows, 
(1) Azo dyes which were substantially untreated when passed through the activated 
sludge system : 
C.I. Acid Black 1 C.I. Acid Orange 10 C.I. Acid Red 1 
C.I
. Acid Red 14 C.I. Acid Red 18 C.I, Acid Red 337 
C.I
. Acid Yellow 17 C.I. Acid Yellow 23 C.I. Acid Yellow 49 
C.I. Acid Yellow 4 
(2) Azo dyes which were adsorbed and apparently not  biodegraded : 
C.I. Acid Blue 113 C.L Acid Red 151 C.I. Direct Violet 9 
C.I. Direct Yellow 28 
(3) Azo dyes which appeared to be biodegraded : 
C.I. Acid Orange 7 C.I. Acid Orange 8 C.I. Acid Red 88 
They found that when azo dyes have high sulfonic acid substitution, poor or 
no adsorption of the dye by the microbial cell or cell byproducts would occur. This 
also limits the chance of aerobic biodegradation. 
37 b. Bacteria 
The studies concerning the fate of azo dyes in activated sludge system 
showed that most azo dyes were mainly and significantly removed by adsorption on 
the activated sludge floes and only a very few appeared to be biodegraded. 
However, in the study ofUrushigawa and Yonezowa (1977)，it was found that nearly 
all azo dyes could be reduced by the microorganisms in activated sludge. In a study 
of textile effluent, 120 microorganisms were isolated, most of them were Bacillus 
and Pseudomonas species (Meyer, 1981). As early as 1937，decolorization of azo 
dyes in spoiled diary products was found to be attributed to predominant lactic acid 
bacteria, which turned the dyes into amines. Later, more studies reported that 
reduction of a large variety of azo dyes occurred extensively among intestinal 
microflora (Roxon et al, 1967; Walker and Ryan, 1971; Larsen et al, 1976; Chung 
et al., 1978; Idaka et alf 1980; Brown, 1981; Manning et cd” 1985; Rafii et al” 
1990). Appreciating the versatile abilities of microorganisms in degrading and 
mineralizing nearly all organic matters in the nature, more studies were encouraged 
to determine the feasibility of using azo dye-degrading microorganisms to treat 
dyestuff wastes. 
Horitsu et al. (1977) used Bacillus subtilis, which was selected for having 
faster and stronger decolorization rate of /?-aminoazobenzene (PAAB), to convert 
PAAB, an azo dye hardly degraded by activated sludge and even also decreases the 
activity of the activated sludge, into aniline and /?-phenylenediamine. They believed 
that the first degradation reaction of PAAB was reduction fission of azo linkage. 
Ogawa et al (1981a) found that generally the larger the molecular size of the 
dye, the lower was its inhibition to growth of Bacillus snbtilis. Dye with two 
sulfonic groups was less inhibiting than when with one sulfonic group. These results 
suggeste
d that dyes of large size or greater hydrophilicity could not permeate a cell 
and so have lower harmful effect on the cell. Also, Ogawa et al. (1981a) found that 
the bacterium can use PAAB and Disperse Violet, which has primary amino group, 
38 as nitrogen source. However, the bacterium could not use heterocyclic compounds 
such as imidazole and pyridine as nitrogen source. 
Idaka et al (1982), firstly reported that Bacillus subtilis can reduce PAAB 
into p-phenylenediamine and aniline, and then they found that the bacterium could 
also acetylate PAAB into p-acetamidoazobenzene,  /?-phenylenediamine into p-
aminoacetanilide,  and aniline into acetanilide. 
From soil of draining trenches at a dyeing factory, Idaka et al (1979 a and b) 
isolated Aeromonas hydrophila var 24B and Pseudomonas pseudomallei 13 NA, 
which can tolerate and assimilate PAAB. 
Ogawa et al. (1981 b) then used Pseudomonas pseudomallei 13 NA isolated 
in previous studies of Idaka et al (1979 b) to remove PAAB in a one-stage and 
three-stage continuous culture system. They found that the bacterium can remove 80 
% of 10 ppm PAAB in the three-stage system. By comparing the two systems, they 
believed that the bacterium metabolized the dye better under poor nutrient 
conditions. 
Ogawa et al (1986) studied the decolorization of C.I. Acid Orange 12 
(A012), C.I. Acid Orange 20 (A020) and C.I. Acid Red 88 (AR88) by 
Pseudomonas cepacia 13NA and found that extent of decolorization was also 
greater in multi-stage than one-stage continuous culture system because the bacterial 
cells decolorized dyes more effectively in final culture flask in which poor nutrient 
compelled bacterial cells to assimilate dye for growth. Also, decolorization was 
higher at pH 7.0-7.5 at which the growth of the bacterium was the maximum. 
Yatome et al. (1981) found that Pseudomonas cepacia 13NA can decolorize 
several azo dyes and their decolorizability was in the following decreasing order : 
C I. Acid Orange 20 (A020) > /?-aminoazobenzene (PAAB) > C.I. Acid Red 88 
(AR88) > C.I. Acid Orange 7 (A07) > C.I. Acid Orange 12 (AO 12) > C.I. Direct 
Yellow 4 (DY4) > C.I. Direct Red 28 (DR28). It appeared that when hydroxy group 
was in o-position, such as that in A07,  compared with A020 which has the hydroxy 
grou
p at p-position, decolorization was facilitated. Also, AR88 which has a 
39 naphthalene ring was decolorized faster than A07, which has a benzene ring. They 
also found that there was no appreciable correlation between decolorizability of dyes 
and their octane-water partition coefficient. This result may indicate that the 
decolorizability of dyes is not related to their permeability through bacterial cell wall, 
but to their molecular weight of dyes. 
,’, Idaka et al (1978a; 1978b) examined the biodegradation of p-
aminoazobenzene by Pseudomonas cepacia 13NA under shaking condition at 37 °C 
and found that the azo linkage of PAAB was first reductively cleaved, and then the 
amine products (aniline and p-phenylenediamine) were acetylated. Hydroxylation of 
the products then occurred to result in o-aminophenol, m ，and /7-acetoamidophenol 
and 3,4-dihydroxyacetanilide (from aniline) and p-acetamidophenol and 3,4-
dihydroxyacetanilide (from /?-phenylenediamine). 
Ogawa and Yatome (1990) immobilized Pseudomonas cepacia 13NA with K-
carrageenan gel on disks of a rotating biological contactor fed with molasses-
containing medium and azo dyes p-aminoazobenzene, C.I. Acid Red 88 and C.I. 
Direct Blue 6. It was found that the bacterium showed a stable decolorizing ability 
of all three dyes for a long time. The bioreactor had three compartment in sequence. 
The bacterium grew well in first compartment because of rich nutrient while 
decolorized better in the third compartment because of poor nutrient quality. The 
result indicated that dyes appeared to be degraded by "starved" cells, and convinced 
Ogawa and Yatome to suggest that it is necessary to reconcile the incompatible 
condition
s of the growth of microbes and the degradation of the dye in the biological 
treatment of dye-containing wastewater. 
Liu and Yang (1991) found that growing cells, intact non-growing cells, cell-
free extract and purified enzymes of Pseudomonas sp. S-42, which was isolated from 
activated sludge, could decolorize azo dyes Diamira Brilliant Orange RR, Direct 
Brown M and Eriochrome Brown R under the conditions of pH 7.0 and temperature 
of 37 °C. Oxygen could inhibit the decolorizing activities of cell-free extract and 
purified enzymes. 
40 The study on the structure-activity  relationship was difficult for intact cells 
due to the structure-dependent permeability of azo dyes through cell membranes. 
Yatome et al (1990) investigated the degradation of several azo dyes by cell-free 
extract of Pseudomonas slutzeri and found that the redox potential and 
hydrophobicity of dyes were important to understand the relationship between the 
ease of degradation of dyes and their structures, 
Yatome et al (1991) investigated the decolorization of several sulphonated 
and non-sulphonated azo dyes by intact cells and cell-free extract of Pseudomonas 
stutzeri I AM 12097, Pseudomonas cepacia 13NA and Bacillus subtilis IFO 13719. 
They found that these bacteria showed very different decolorization abilities towards 
the dyes due to different specificities of their azo reductases, different permeabilities 
of their cell membranes and different structures of the dyes. They concluded that azo 
reduction is microorganism-specific  and dye-specific. 
Zimmermann et al (1984) yielded Pseudomonas sp, K24 and Pseudomonas 
sp. KF46 which could specifically utilize azo dyes Orange I and Orange II 
respectively through adaptation in chemostat culture. The azoreductases of the two 
bacterial strains’ Orange I azo reductase and Orange II azo reductase, were found to 
evolve from a common precursor protein of the bacterium from which the above two 
bacterial strains derived. Table 3 lists the similarities  and differences of these two 
azoreductases.

Pagga and Brown (1986) investigated the biodegradability of 87 commercial 
dyestufFs in a short-term aerobic biodegradation test by bacteria from wastewater 
treatment plant and found that 62 % of them showed significant removal of color but 
seemed likely that the prime mechanism for this removal was by adsorption of the 
intact dye molecules. 
Using the OECD Guideline Methods 301A and 301E, Brown (1983) tested 
the biodegradability of lipophilic aromatic amines including aniline, o-toluidine, p-
anisidine, /7-phenetidine, o-dianisidine and 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine, which were either 
proven or suspected as carcinogens, under aerobic condition by microorganisms in 
final effluent from a domestic sewage treatment plants. He found that the presence 
of 100-200 mg/1 of yeast extract could promote the biodegradation of o-dianisidine 
.,..•: .‘ ". - . ； ' ... •‘ . .,, 
42 and 3,3-dichlorobenzidine, which showed "inherent biodegradability". The possible 
explanation was that yeast extract was providing specific growth factors necessary 
for the breakdown of these amine. Or it might merely act as a readily degradable 
food source and build up a large concentration of active bacteria which were then 
able to breakdown the amines. For the other amines, they showed "ready 
biodegradability". 
Brown and Hamburger (1987) examined the biodegradability of 14 azo dyes 
(C.I. Acid Orange 7，C.I. Acid Yellow 36, C.I. Acid Dye 13155，C.I. Acid Red 114, 
C.I. Acid Yellow 25, C.I, Acid Yellow 151，C.I. Acid Black 24, C.I. Direct Red 7， 
C.I. Direct Blue 14, C.I, Direct Blue 15, C.I. Direct Yellow 12, C.I. Direct Yellow 
50, C.I. Mordant Black 9 and C.I, Mordant Black 11) under aerobic and anaerobic 
conditions. Analysis by appropriate chromatographic method, results indicated that 
all azo dyes were reductively cleaved (57-100 % cleavage) to the corresponding 
amine products, By dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analysis, these amines did not 
appear to be anaerobically degraded. However, for seven selected azo dyes (C.I. 
Acid Yellow 36, C.I. Acid Dye 13155, C.I. Acid Black 24, C.I. Acid Yellow 25, C.I. 
Direct Red 7，C.I. Direct Blue 15 and C.I. Direct Yellow 12), they showed that 
different % of degradation of their metabolites were shown under aerobic condition. 
However, they found that after these dyes had undergone decolorization, 
there were in general lesser quantitative yield of the expected metabolites than the 
theoretical yield. They thought that these might be due to that: 
(1) some commercial dye products were in practice as low as 80 % of the material 
present. 
(2) sparingly soluble or sorptive metabolites might not be detected or only partially 
quantified as only aqueous phase was analyzed for the presence of metabolites. 
(3) there might also be other anaerobic biodegradative pathways of some azo dyes 
other than the reductive cleavage of azo bond. 
Haug et al. (1991) used a mixed bacterial community growing aerobically 
with 6-aminonaphthalene-2-sulfonic acid (6A2NS) as the sole sources of carbon and 
43 energy, and found the bacteria reduced azo dye, Mordant Yellow 3 (MY3), under 
anaerobic condition into the corresponding amine products 6-aminonaphthalene-2-
sulfonate (6A2NS) and 5-aminosalicylate (5AS). The culture was then aerated and 
they found that the bacterial could convert 6A2NS into 5AS. The another bacterial 
strai
n BN9 could then mineralize 5AS. The addition of 10 mM glucose into culture 
could cause complete reduction of MY3, as well as Amaranth, 4-
hydroxyazobenzene-4-sulfonic acid and C.I. Acid Yellow 21，which had been found 
unable to be completely reduced without glucose. These results suggested that 
/ 
glucose could act as a donor of reduction equivalents [e.g., via NAD(P)H or reduced 
flavi
n adenine dinucleotide (FADH2) ], or the addition of glucose could result in 
more actively respiring cells, thus rapidly depleting the medium of oxygen and 
enabling azo reductases to transfer reduction equivalents to the azo dyes. 
The success of this system led to the study on the feasibility of using this 
anaerobic -> aerobic system to treat azo dye-containing wastewaters. Under 
anaerobic condition，it reduces a wide range of azo dyes, and under aerobic 
condition, it oxidizes many different aminonapthalenesulfonic acids. 
c. Fungi 
The feasibility of using fungal system to degrade synthetic compounds has 
been extensively studied. White-rot basidiomycetes, especially Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium, received most of the attention due to their versatile and rather non-
specific aerobic lignin-degrading ability. The lignin-depending ability is initiated 
during secondary metabolic (idiophasic) growth, and could degrade synthetic organic 
compounds with similar structure as lignin. Lignin is an optically inactive, random 
phenylpropanoid polymer, which is relatively recalcitrant to biodegradation in the 
nature (Spadaro et a/., 1992) 
Many studies had revealed that Phanerochaete chrysosporium is able to 
mineralize, at least partially, a variety of persistent environmental pollutants including 
44 chlorophenols, nitrotoluene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and dioxin (Spadaro 
etal.,  1992). 
Although many previous studies found that bacteria can reduce a large kinds 
of azo dyes rather non-specifically, this non-specific reduction is limited to anaerobic 
conditions whereas very few bacteria can reduce the dyes efficiently under aerobic 
condition. 
Even though the Pseudomonas strains isolated by Zimmermann et al. (1984) 
could effectively mineralize azo dyes Orange I and II. However, they are not useful in 
degrading dyes in wastewater because these bacteria showed strict specificity toward 
single azo dye to which they had been adapted. Therefore many studies uses 
Phanerochaete chrysosporittm to degrade azo dyes under aerobic condition. 
Cripps et al. (1990) found that nitrogen-limiting culture of Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium BKM-F-1767, producing high level of lignin-degrading enzymes -
lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase could decolorize over 95 % of Orange 
II, Tropaeolin O and Congo Red at an initial concentration of 57 |iM, 63 jiM and 76 
|iM respectively. In addition, it was found that much of the initial, rapid loss of dye 
fro
m the culture fluid appeared to be primarily due to adsorption to the mycelia. The 
adsorption was more pronounced in nitrogen-sufficient culture but in which lignin-
degrading ability of the fungus seemed unable to be switched on. 
Spadaro et al. (1992) found that both nitrogen-limiting and nitrogen-
sufficient cultures of Phanerochaete chrysosporium OGC 101 were able to 
mineralize 14C-ring-labeled azo dyes: 4-phenyIazophenol, 4-phenylazo-2-
methoxyphenol, 2-(4'-acetamidophenylazo)-4-methylphenol, 4-phenylazoaniline, 
N,N-dimethyl-4-phenylazoaniline, 4-(4'-nitrophenylazo)-aniline and l-phenylazo-2-
naphthol after 12-day incubation. The extent of mineralization achieved in nitrogen-
limiting-culture was 23.1 to 48  %， which was significantly greater than that (0.8 to 
21.9 %) in nitrogen-sufficient culture. The results indicated that there may be 
involvement of enzymes other than lignin-degrading enzymes in mineralization of the 
above compounds. Moreover, the rate at which Phanerochaete chrysosporium 
45 mineralized aromatic rings of azo dyes was dependent on the nature of ring 
substitsuents. Aromatic rings with a hydroxy, an amino, an acetamido, or a nitro 
substitsuent were degraded faster than rings without such substitsuents. 
Paszczynski et al (1991a) examined the biodegradability of 12 wide-type 
Streptomyces sp. (ligninocellulolytic) and Phatierochaete chrysosporium BKM-F-
1767 (ATCC 24725) (ligninolytic) towards commercial azo dye C.I. Acid Yellow 9， 
sulfanilic acid, synthesized azo dye 1 and 2. The latter two were synthesized by 
conjugating guaiacol molecule (2-methoxyphenol) onto C.I. Acid Yellow 9 and 
sulfanilic acid via azo-linkage. They found that five of six Streptomyces sp., which 
were capable of assimilating vanillic acid - a compound having same ring substitution 
pattern (4-hydroxy-3-methoxy) as guaiacol, could significantly decolorize the two 
synthesized azo dyes. These Streptomyces sp. could not decolorize sulfanilic acid 
and C.I. Acid Yellow 9. Moreover, Phanerochaete chrysosporium could almost 
completely decolorize synthesized azo dye 1 and 2 whereas it only could decolorize 
sulfanilic acid and C.I. Acid Yellow 9 to a limited extent. These results indicated 
that, by Streptomyces sp., the degradation of  sulfanilic acid and C.I, Acid Yellow 9 
wer
e rendered feasible by allowing the bacteria to start assimilating by attacking the 
guaiacol substitsuent first. While, the linkage of guaiacol molecule to these two 
compounds increased their susceptibility to degradation by Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium. Therefore, Paszczynski et al. (1991a) suggested that newly 
synthesized compounds can be rendered more easily biodegradable by selective 
linkage with readily degradable substitsuents into the compounds. 
Later, Paszczynski et al. (1991b) compared the degrading ability of 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium BKM-1667 (ATCC 24725) with that of Streptomyces 
chromofuscus All (ATCC 55184) towards sulfanilic acid, sulfonated and non-
sulfonated azo dyes. These dyes were coupled with guaiacol molecules, aromatic 
ring or naphthol group. Phanerochaete chrysosporium BKM-1667 demonstrated a 
greater ability than Streptomyces chromofuscus All in mineralizing azo dyes. 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium BKM-1667 could mineralize all the sulfonated azo 
46 dyes and the substitution pattern did not significantly influence the susceptibility of 
the dyes to degradation. In contrast, Strepiowyces chromofuscus Al 1 was unable to 
mineralize aromatics with sulfo groups except those coupled with guaiacol molecule. 
It seems that the lignin-like guaiacol structure attached to sulfonated azo dye 
was a must to initiate degradation of Streptomyces chromofuscus Al 1  and suggested 
tha
t this bacterial enzymatic systems responsible for degradation may be somehow 
more selective to lignin-like structures than that of Phanerochaete chrysosporium 
BKM-1667. 
In order to study the influence of aromatic substitution on the degradability 
of azo dyes，Pasti-Grigsby et al (1992) used 19 azo dyes which had different 
substituted groups, such as methoxy, hydroxy, methyl, fluro, chloro, sulfony and 
amine, and different number of substituted groups at different position. The 
degradation of these dyes by Phanerochaete chrysosporium BKM-1767 (ATCC 
24725) and five Streptomyces sp. were monitored. They found when an azo dye was 
susceptible to decolorization, all five Streptomyces sp. could decolorize it to some 
extent whereas Phanerochaete chrysosporium BKM-1767 could decolorize all 19 
dyes to different extent. It was found that significant degradation of azobenzene 
derivative dyes by Streptomyces sp, occurred only when the hydroxy group was in 
the 尸-position relative to the azo linkage and  at least one or two electron-releasing 
substitsuents
, such as methoxy or/and alkyl group, were in the o-position relative to 
the hydroxy group. Degradation of the naphthol-derivative azo dyes occurred only 
when the hydroxy group was in the 4-position relative to the azo bond. The second 
condensed aromatic ring in naphthalene probably acted as an electron-donor, similar 
to the electron-releasing  substitsuents in the benzene ring. It was found that the 
extracellular peroxidase produced by Streptomyces sp. may be similar in substrate 
specificity to Mn(II) peroxidase of Phanerochaete chrysosporium BKM-1767 
because they can only decolorize the dyes decolorized by Mn(II) peroxidase, but not 
those that were decolorized by lignin peroxidase of Phanerochaete chrysosporium 
BKM-1767. For the lignin-degrading system of this fungus, it contains a number of 
47 peroxidases which can catalyze the depolymerization of lignin and the initial 
oxidation of a wide range of other compounds. Generally, the substitution of the 
dyes with electron-donating group(s) could make the dyes more easily oxidized by 
both species because it lowered the potential of the dyes and facilitated them to form 
cation radicals. The enzymes responsible for the oxidation of dyes are different from 
that of bacteria, which are reductive enzymes reducing azo dyes favorably under 
anaerobic condition. 
In the culture of both species, the extracellular peroxidases were shown to 
appear during the stationary, this explained the initial lag phase in the decolorization 
of dyes by them. 
Theses studies suggested that the application of Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium to treat dye-containing industrial effluents or for the bioremediation 
of dye-contaminated soil is highly feasible, 
d. Algae 
Liu and Liu (1991) investigated the degradation of 31 azo dyes at 20 ppm by 
algae : Chlorella pyrenoidosa, C. vulgaris and Oscillateria tenuis over 96-bour 
incubation. They found that Chlorella vulgaris could decolorize 29 dyes with extent 
varying from 5 to 100 %. The extent of decolorization of dyes seemed to be relevant 
to their molecular structures. Dyes with an amino or a hydroxy group could be 
readily decolorized. These groups also could counteract the inhibitory effect of 
sulfonyl group on reduction. Substitution with methyl, methyoxy, nitro or sulfo 
group made dyes hardly be decolorized. All three algae were found able to 
effectively degrade aniline products into simple inorganic materials. The absence of 
inorganic carbon and nitrogen in the medium facilitated the algae to utilize Erichrome 
blue SE and black T as sole sources of carbon and nitrogen. Addition of NADH or 
NADPH increased the algal azo reduction. These results indicated that activity 
demonstrated that NADH or NADPH could act as electron donors for the algal azo 
48 reductases. Moreover, algae which had been cultured with 10 ppm of dye displayed 
higher reduction activity of that dye. This suggested that azo reductase is inducable. 
Liu and Liu (1991) thought that algae, which have been believed to serve as 
an oxygen source for the aerobic action of bacteria, can also have direct effect on the 
degradation of azo dyes. 
1.8.2 Physico-chemical Methods 
It had been found that direct and Indirect photolysis play important roles in 
degrading azo dyes in the environment. Hustert and Zepp (1992) studied the 
feasibility of using heterogeneous photocatalysis, a special form of indirect photolysis 
induced by semiconductors anatase form of titanium oxide (Ti02) in degrading azo 
dyes. They dissolved 50 mg of each of the azo dyes including C.I. Solvent Red 1, 
C.I. Acid Orange 7，C.I. Orange G and 4-hydroxyazobenzene (4-HAB) into 1.2 L of 
deionized water with 1.0 g of TiC>2 suspension and it was then irradiated with UV-
light (X>290 nm). 
Kinetic analysis of the dyes and products in mixture by HPLC, total organic 
carbon (TOC) and GC-MS measurements up to 3 hours showed that 
photodegradation of 4-HAB, C.I. Acid Orange 7 and C I. Orange G followed first 
order reaction for several half-lived whereas Solvent Red 1 did not. The products 
formed in photodegradation revealed that oxidation of dyes by hydroxyl radicals was 
the predominant reaction pathway. Reductive cleavage of the azo bonds, presumably 
vi
a dye scavenging of electrons from electron-hole pairs on the Ti02 surface, was a 
minor pathway. They suggested that subsequent photo-oxidation of these products 
might result in slow conversion to, carbon dioxide, and heterogeneous catalysis may i l \ ' ；‘ 
be a useful process for reduction of water pollution caused by azo dyes. 
49 1.9 Purposes of Study 
In view of the widespread and increasing use of azo dyes, a large number of 
studies concerning their harmful effects - toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity 
upon microorganisms and animals, and the possible treatment of them by 
physicochemical and biological method have been undertaken. 
Although there were many studies reported on the degradation of a large 
variety by bacteria and  fungi, only a Few showed that there were mineralization of 
certai
n azo dyes by bacteria, e.g., Pseudomonas spp. (Zimmermann et al, 1984) and 
Phanerochaete chrysospormm (Spadaro et al, 1992; Paszczynski et al, 1991a and 
b). Most of these studies focused on the success of achieving complete 
decolorization of azo dyes by their microbial isolates. 
Almost all of these studies showed that reductive cleavage of azo bond was 
the first degradative reaction occurred when the azo dyes were exposed to microbial 
attack, under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. This reduction converted the 
dyes into their corresponding aromatic amines. Mutagenicity tests indicated that 
both azo dyes and their aromatic amines products are mutagenic (Chung et al., 
1981). Chung et al. (1983) reported that even though many azo dyes are non-
mutagenic, the degradative products of these dyes after reductive cleavage are 
mutagenic. 
These aromatic amines are in reality more hazardous than their parental dyes 
because they are colorless and more mutagenic. Treatment of azo dyes by the 
judgment of decolorization may pose more destructive pollution problem onto the 
environment. Therefore, decolorization of azo dyes should not be regarded as the 
complete treatment unless subsequent complete degradation or mineralization of the 
reductive cleavage products is followed. 
The objectives of the present study is to determine the feasibility of 
degradation of azo dyes by a carefully selected microbial isolates. Methyl Red was 
selected in this study because firstly, it is of rather simple structure to allow 
50 identification of the degradative products, and secondly, one of its reductive cleavage 
product is DMPD (Figure 9), which has been well-known as toxic and mutagenic. 
This product demands appropriate treatment to remove its harmful effects upon the 
environment. 
So et al. (1990) had isolated Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l from a heavily 
polluted industrial wastewater sample to degrade and decolorize Methyl Red. They 
found that this bacterium decolorized up to 400 ppm Methyl Red with the presence 
of 1 g/1 (NH4)2SC>4 and 1 % ethanol as nitrogen and carbon source respectively 
under aerobic condition. In addition, TLC and HPLC analyses indicated that it can 
mineralize o-aminobenzoic acid, one of the reductive cleavage products of Methyl 
Red, but leave DMPD intact. 
To complement the study of So et al (1990), the major objectives of the 
present study are to isolate and characterize microorganism(s),  which is/are capable 
of degrading Methyl Red and/or DMPD completely. Microorganisms which are 
found capable of degrading especially DMPD could be used to treat DMPD and azo 
dyes, which generated DMPD upon reductive cleavage by microorganisms, in 
industrial effluents. This microbial treatment of DMPD could reduce harmful effects 
of DMPD-containing industrial effluents in the environment.

3.1 Isolation, Selection and Characterization of Methyl Red-degrading 
and N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylene diamine-degrading Microbial Isolates 
3.1.1 Isolation of Methyl Red-degrading Microbial Isolates from Dye-
containing  Wastewater, Activated Sludge and Soil 
a. Isolation from Activated Sludge 
Activated sludge was collected from Shatin Sewage Treatment Work. The 
sample was 10°-, 101-, 102- and 103-fold diluted with sterile distilled water. 
Aliquot of 0.1 ml of each diluted sample was spread on Mod SM (Modified 
Screening Medium, So et al, 1990) (Appendix 1) plate containing 150 mg/1 Methyl 
Red and the plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. Isolates grown with halo or 
discolored zone formed around their colonies were picked out and streaked on Mod 
SM plates containing 200 and 300 mg/1 Methyl Red and incubated at the same 
condition. Isolates growing on these plates with halo or discolored zone formed 
around their colonies were picked out (Source 1) and purified on Nutrient Broth 
(NB) (Appendix 1) plates. 
Aliquot of 0.1 ml of each diluted sample was also spread on Mod SM agar 
plates containing 100 mg/1 N,N-dimethyl-/7-phenylene  diamine (DMPD) (Sigma) and 
incubated at the same condition. Microorganisms which could grow on the plates 
were picked out (Source 2)-
100 ml of 2° SM (Secondary Screening Medium modified from Mod SM) 
(Appendix 1) liquid medium containing 50 mg/1 and 100 mg/1 DMPD was 
respectively inoculated with 5 ml： activated sludge and the media were incubated at 
30 °C at 200 rpm for 1 week. The culture was then 101-, 102- and 103-fold diluted 
with sterile distilled water and 0.1 ml of aliquot of each diluted culture was spread on 
2° SM plate containing 50 mg/1 DMPD. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2-3 
days. Isolates grown on the plates were picked out, purified on NB plates and 
54 streaked on 2° SM plates containing 200 mg/1 Methyl Red. Isolates grown  with halo 
an
d discolored zone formed surrounding the colonies were picked out (Source 3). 
3° SM (Tertiary Screening Medium modified from 2° SM) (Appendix 1) 
plates containing 300 mg/1, 400 mg/1, 500 mg/1, 600 mg/1 and 700 mg/1 Methyl Red, 
an
d 200 mg/1, 300 mg/1, 400 mg/1, 500 mg/1 and 600 mg/1 DMPD were prepared. All 
o
f the isolates selected were streaked on these plates and the plates were incubated at 
30 °C for 3 days: Isolates which showed better decolorization or discoloration ability 
at high concentration of Methyl Red as well as better growth at high concentration of 
DMPD were selected, 
b. Isolation from Dye-containing Wastewater, Activated Sludge and Soil 
Samples were also collected from three sites: Tsuen Wan Cho Kung Tam, 
Shatin Sewage Treatment Work and the campus of The Chinese University of Hong 
Kong. Samples from Tsuen Wan Cho Kung Tam were red and brown oily, greasy 
sludge as well as sediment. Activated sludge was collected from Shatin Sewage 
Treatment Work. Soil was collected from the campus of the Chinese University of 
Hong Kong. 
Approximately one gram of sediment or soil sample was suspended in 10 ml 
sterile 0.85% NaCl solution and the suspension was mixed thoroughly. The 
supernatants of the sample suspensions and the sludge samples were diluted with 
sterile distilled water to 101-，102-，103-，104-，105- and 106-fold. Aliquot of 0.1 ml 
of each 101-, 102-，and 10^-fold diluted samples was spread on Minimum Salt 
Medium (MSM) (Appendix 1) plate containing 1 g/1 glucose (Univar), lg/1 
ammonium sulphate (Peking), 0.25 g/1 yeast extract (Biolife), 0.05 M phosphate 
buffer (pH 7) (Univar) (Appendix 1) and 100 mg/1 Methyl Red (BDH) (Methyl Red 
selectiv
e plate). Phosphate buffer had been autoclave-sterilized separately and 
Methyl Red stock solution had been filter-sterilized by 0.45 nm filter before they 
were added into the medium. Aliquot of 0.1 ml of each 103-，104-，105- and 106-fold 
55 diluted samples was spread on Nutrient Broth No.2 (NB2) (Oxoid) (Appendix 1) 
plate. All inoculated plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3 days. The number of 
colonies developed on both plates were counted and the percentage of 
microorganisms that could grow on Methyl Red selective plate was calculated. 
Percentage of microorganisms that can grow on Methyl Red selective plate 
No, of colonies grown on Methyl Red selective plate X dilution factor 
No. of colonies grown on NB2 plate X dilution factor 
Isolates grown on Methyl Red selective plates with halo or discolored zone 
formed surrounding their colonies were picked out and streaked on NB2 plates for 
culture purification. The NB2 plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. 
3.1.2 Selection of Methyl Red-degrading Microbial Isolates 
a. Methyl Red Selective Plates 
Pure culture of the selected isolates was streaked on Methyl Red selective 
plates to confirm their abilities to decolorize or discolor Methyl Red. These plates 
were examined after incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. 
Isolates with confirmed Methyl Red decolorizing or discoloring ability were 
kept on 50% strength Nutrient Broth (NB) (Oxoid) slant (Appendix 1). 
b. Absorbance of the Cultural Supernatant at 200-340 nm 
The isolates selected at section 3,1.1. a and the isolates with confirmed Methyl 
Red decolorizing or discoloring ability selected at section 3.1.2. were streaked on 
NB2 plates for 12-18 hours at 30 °C. Cells grown on the NB2 plates were picked by 
sterile swabs and suspended in 10 ml 0.85% NaCl solution to make up to cell 
56 suspension with AsgOnm equal to 0.2. Aliquot of 0.1 ml cell suspension of each 
isolate was added into 10 ml MSM in test tube containing lg/1 glucose, lg/1 
ammonium sulphate, 0.25 g/1 yeast extract, 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 7) and 100 
mg/1 Methyl Red. The medium was incubated in a reciprocal shaking incubator at 
30 °C and 200 rpm for 1 week. 
The culture was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm (2020lx g) in centrifuge (RC5C 
Sorvall, rotor type: SS34) for 10 minutes to remove cells. The UV-Vis spectra of 
the cultural supernatants of the selected isolates were determined by 
spectrophotometer (Milton Roy Spectronic 3000 array spectrophotometer). 
Among all the isolates, those having the cultural supernatants showing overall 
low absorbance at 200-340 nm were selected, 
c. Degradation Value of N,N-Dimethyl-/?-phenylene  diamine and o-Aminobenzoic 
acid at Different Concentrations of Methyl Red 
Isolates selected by giving low absorbance at 200-340 nm were grown on 
NB2 plates for 12-18 hours. Cells on NB2 plates were suspended in sterile 10 ml 
0.85% NaCl by sterile swabs to make up to A5gonm equal to 0.2. Aliquot of 0.1 ml 
cell suspension of each isolate was added into 10 ml MSM containing 0.1 g/1 glucose, 
0.
1 g/1 ammonium sulphate, 0.25 g/1 yeast extract, 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 7) 
and, 50 mg/1, 100 mg/1, 200 mg/1, 300 mg/1 and 400 mg/1 Methyl Red respectively. 
Aliquot of 0.1 ml sterile 0.85% NaCl solution was added instead of cell suspension 
into 10 ml MSM as a control. Cultures were incubated in a reciprocal shaking 
incubator at 30 °C and 200 rpm for 2 weeks. After incubation, the cultures were 
centrifuged at 13,000 rpm (2020lx^) in centriflige (RC5C Sorvall, rotor type: SS34) 
for 10 minutes to remove cells. The cultural supernatant was 10-fold diluted with 
0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 7) before determination of the UV-Vis spectra. 
The absorbance of the diluted supernatant at the characteristic  wavelengths of 
Methyl Red, DMPD and o-aminobenzoic acid (ABA) were measured. Degradation 
Value ofDMPD and ABA degraded were calculated as follows: 
..’ .•..  、：.  ... _.. . 
57 When one molecule of Methyl Red was reductively cleaved, it gave rise to 
one molecule ofDMPD and one molecule of ABA (Figure 9).

When Degradation Value (DV) of DMPD or ABA is equal to one, it 
represents that the isolate can completely cleave Methyl Red and completely degrade 
DMPD or ABA generated from Methyl Red, When DV of DMPD or ABA is zero, it 
shows that the isolate cannot degrade DMPD or ABA. Isolates which showed high 
Degradation Value of DMPD and ABA were selected. 
3.1.3 Enrichment of N,N-Dimethyl-^-phenylene diamine-degrading Bacteria 
from Dye-containing wastewater, Activated Sludge and Soil 
Soil samples were collected from five different sites at the campus of the 
Chinese University of Hong Kong, together with the samples used for isolation of 
Methyl Red-degrading microorganisms. Five grams sediment and different soil 
samples and five ml different sludge samples were individually inoculated into 100 ml 
MSM containing 0.1 g/1 glucose, 0.25 g/1 yeast extract, 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 
7) and 50 mg/1 0.45 |im millipore membrane filter-sterilized  N,N-dimethyl-/?-
phenylene diamine monohydrochloride (DMPD HC1) (Sigma) in a 250 ml conical 
flask. The enrichment cultures were incubated in a reciprocal shaking incubator at 30 
°C and 200 rpm for 2 weeks. 
59 After 2-week incubation, aliquot of 0.1 ml of each 101-, 102- and 103-fold 
diluted enrichment culture was spread on MSM plate containing same composition as 
the enrichment culture. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3 days. Isolates 
which grown on MSM plates with halo or discolored zone formed around their 
colonies were picked out. Five ml of each enrichment culture was inoculated into 
100 ml MSM of same composition as used before and incubated at 30 °C for two 
weeks. These steps were continued at every two-week. 
3.1.4 Isolation of N,N-Dimethyl-/7-phenylene diamine-degrading Bacteria 
Since no isolate in enrichment culture able to form halo or discolored zone on 
MSM plate containing 50 mg/1 DMPD HC1 could be found. Each culture was 105-, 
106- and 107-fold diluted and 0.1 ml of each diluted culture was spread on NB2 
plate. The inoculated plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. Bacterial isolates of 
each sample grown on NB2 plates were characterized by their colonial morphologies. 
Isolates of high predominance on NB2 plates were picked out for further selection. 
3.1.5 Selection of N,N-Dimethyl-/?-phenylene diamine-degrading Bacteria 
Isolates from section 3.1.4 were streaked on NB2 plates and the plates were 
incubated at 30°C for 12-18 hours. Cells grown on these plates were suspended in 
sterile 0.85 % NaCl solution to make up to A5gonm ec\u^ t0 0.2, Aliquot of 0.1 ml 
cell suspension of each isolate was added into 10 ml MSM containing 0.25 g/1 yeast 
extract, 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 7) and 50 mg/1 DMPD HC1. One set of media 
was supplied with 0.1 g/1 glucose and the another set was supplied with 1 g/1 glucose. 
Sterile distilled water was added to replace 0.45 |am membrane filter-sterilized 
DMPD HC1 stock solution into 10 ml MSM as a blank. Similarly, sterile 0.85 % 
NaCl solution was added instead of cell suspension into the MSM as a control. The 
cultures were incubated at 30°C and 200 rpm in a reciprocal shaking incubator for 1 
week. After incubation, 1 ml of each culture was transferred into an eppendorf tube 
60 containing 0.2 ml 2 M hydrochloric acid, The acidified culture was mixed 
thoroughly and the absorbance at 580 nm was measured. The culture was then 
centrifbged at 13,000 rpm in microcentrifuge (MSE Micro Centaur) for 10 minutes 
to remove cells. The absorbance of the supernatants at 580 nm was measured. Also, 
the UV-Vis spectra of the cultural supernatant of the isolates were measured. The 
isolates having the supernatant showing significant decrease in absorbance at the 
characteristic  wavelengths of DMPD-HCI in comparison to that of the control were 
selected for identification by Biolog microstation system. 
3.1.6 Identification of the Selected Methyl Red-degrading and N,N-
Dimethyl-/7-phenylene diamine-degrading Bacteria 
a. Gram Staining 
Each selected isolate was grown in NB2 at 30°C for 12-18 hours. Smear of 
the isolate was made by transferring a loopful culture onto a clean slide and was 
fixed by heat after it was air dried. The smear was flooded with 1 % crystal violet 
stain for 1 minute. It was rinsed with gentle flow of tap water and flooded with 
Gram's iodine solution (0.2 % in 2 % KI) for one minute. The iodine was poured 
off and the smear was flooded with, 95 % ethanol for 15 - 20 seconds. The ethanol 
was rinsed off with gentle flow of tap water and the smear was then flooded with 1% 
Safranin stain for two minutes. The smear was rinsed with tap water gently, blot 
dried to remove excess water and then air dried. The slide was examined under oil 
immersion lens by a light microscope. Bacterial cells retained purple color crystal 
violet stain were Gram-positive bacteria and cells stained in red were Gram-negative 
bacteria. 
61 b. Biolog Microstation System 
Gram-negative bacterial isolates were identified by Biolog GN MicroPlates 
(Biolog Cat. # 1001). The isolates were grown on NB2 plates for 12-18 hours at 30° 
C. The cells on plate were picked by rolling a sterile cotton swab over the colonies. 
Then the swab was twirled and pressed against the inside surface of the test tube (25 
x 150 mm) containing 18-20 ml sterile 0.85 % saline to break up cell clumps and to 
release cells into the saline‘ The tube was gently mixed to prepare a uniform 
suspension, Cell density was adjusted to be within the upper and lower turbidity 
standards, which were made by diluting 48 |nl and 54 |al of Phillip's Milk of Magnesia 
(81 mg/ml suspension of Mg(OH)2) into 20 ml water respectively and mixed by a 
vortex thoroughly. A Biolog GN MicroPlate was removed from a refrigerator and 
warmed to room temperature. Each well of a MicroPlate was carefully, precisely and 
promptly filled with 150 \x\ cell suspension of an isolate. The inoculated MicroPlates 
were incubated at 30°C, Biolog MicroPlates contains 96 wells and 95 of them 
prefilled with 95 different carbon sources and fixed amount oxidized form of 
tetrazolium dye. When the cells can utilize (oxidize) the carbon source in the well 
the tetrazolium dye will be reduced and from a purple color while wells with the 
carbon sources cannot be utilized by the cells will remain colorless. The absorbances 
of purple wells of the MicroPlates after 4-hour and 16- to 24-hour incubation were 
measured by MicroPlate Reader (BIO-RAD Model 3550) at 590 nm. Percent 
八590圆 Change of each well with reference to the control well, which contained no 
carbon source, was calculated as follows, 
A590nm _ A590nm (control well) 
Percent 八59。勤 Change = — x 100 % 
A590nm(contro1 wel1) 
Wells which gave Percent A59onm Change less than 20 %, the reactions in those 
well were considered to be "negative". Wells which gave Percent A59Qnm Change 
more than 20 % but less than 40 %，the reactions in those wells were considered to 
be "borderline". Wells which gave Percent A59Qnm Change more than 40 %, the 
reactions in those wells were considered to be "positive". The pattern of well were 
62 keyed as "negative (-)% "borderline (/)" and "positive (+)" into Biolog's MicroLog 
computer program which automatically cross-references the pattern to the library of 
species. An identification of the isolate was made when an adequate match was 
found. 
For Gram-positive bacterial isolates, the identification procedure was same 
as that for Gram-negative bacterial isolates except that Biolog GP MicroPlates 
(Biolog Cat. # 1004) were used for identification, BUGM culture medium (Biolog 
Universal Growth Medium, Biolog Cat. 枯 6001) were used to grow cell and 
commercial product: Biolog GP Turbidity Standards (Biolog Cat. # 3514) were used 
as turbidity standards . 
3.1.7 Coirelationship of Dry Weight and Absorbance of Cells of Selected 
Methyl Red-degrading Bacterial Isolates 
The isolates were grown on NB2 plates and incubated at 30 °C for 1 day. 
Cells were picked by cotton swabs and suspended in distilled water in test tubes. 
Cell suspension were made to A5g0nm rang^ng from to 1.8. Cell suspension of 
known volume and known optical density was added into a pre-weighed aluminum 
cup, which was pre-heated at 105 °C overnight and cooled down to room 
temperature at desiccator, and dried in oven at 105 °C overnight. The cups with 
dried cells were cooled down to room temperature at a desiccator. The dry weight 
of cells of each isolate in mg/ml was measured and the correlation equation of 
A580nm of the cell suspension to the dry weight (mg) of the cells per ml was 
calculated for each isolate by the computer program SigmaPlot Scientific Graphing 
System version 5.0 (Copyright (c) Jandel Corporation, 1986-1992).

prepare the solutions of these concentrations. The UV-Vis spectra of the solutions 
were measured by spectrophotometer and characteristic wavelengths, at which give 
the peak absorbance, of each compound were determined. Molar concentrations 
(mM) of the solutions were calculated by dividing the percentage concentrations 
(mg/1) of the solutions by the corresponding molecular weight of each compound. 
Standard curves and correlation equations of the characteristic wavelengths and 
molar concentrations of the compounds were determined. 
b. In 0.2 M Hydrochloric Acid

 181518.1^90Fidem with Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l (So et al, 1990), which was included as reference 
strain, were chosen for studies of the effects of different chemical and physical 
conditions on biodegradation of Methyl Red. 
4.1.3 Enrichment of N,N-dimethyl-/?-phenylene diamine-degrading Bacteria 
from Dye-containing Wastewater, Activated Sludge  and Soil 
Aliquot of 0.1 ml of each diluted enrichment cultures containing 50 mg/1 N,N-
dimethyl-/?-phenylene diamine monohydrochloride (DMPD HC1) inoculated with Cho 
Kung Tam red oily sludge, brown oily sludge and sediment, activated sludge and soil 
after 1-week incubation (Figure 19) was spread on agar plates of same composition 
as the enrichment medium and nutrient agar plates to investigate the survival of 
microorganism
s in the enrichment cultures (Figures 20, 21，22, 23 and 24). The 
enrichment cultures of all the samples including the five soil samples were 
subcultured. The five soil samples were subcultured for nine times and the Cho Kung 
Tam red oily sludge, brown oily sludge and sediment, activated sludge and soil were 
subcultured for seven times, 
4.1.
4 Isolation of N,N-dimethyl-/?-phenylene diamine-degrading Bacteria 
For nutrient agar plates spread with diluted 10th enrichment cultures of the 
five soil samples and diluted 8th enrichment cultures of Cho Kung Tam red oily 
sludge, brown oily sludge and sediment, activated sludge and soil, the isolates grown 
were characterized by their colonial morphologies and counted. Table 7 shows the 
colonial count of all the isolates. Those having the predominant population were 
marked with small letters and were subjected to further studies on selecting isolates 
of better DMPD-degrading ability growing in liquid media. Twenty-one isolates of 
higher predominance were selected for further study (Table 8).

89 4.1.5. Selection of N,N-Dimethyl-p-phenylene diamine-degrading Bacteria 
The absorbance at 241nm, 291nm and 560nm, which were characteristic 
wavelengths of DMPD at 0.2 M HCl of the acidified cultural supernatants of the 
twenty-one isolates after corrected with the absorbance of blank were measured. 
The percentage of DMPD reduction in culture of each isolate after incubation was 
calculated by the percentage of reduction of A24inm，A291nm and A560nm 
reference to the control (without bacteria) respectively (Tables 9a and 9b). 
Isolate Sib, BSb, BSd and ASb were four bacteria showing overall higher 
ability in removing DMPD from the media at both 0.1 g/1 glucose and 1 g/1 glucose. 
The
y were then subjected to identification by Biolog microstation system. 
4.1.6 Identification of the Selected Methyl Red-degrading and N，N-
Dimethyl-/?-phenylene diamine-degrading Bacteria 
a. Gram Staining 
The ten Methyl Red-degrading bacterial isolates subjected to selection basing 
on their Degradation Values of DMPD and ABA at different concentrations of 
Methyl Red (item c of section 3,1.2) were found to be all Gram-negative. They were 
then identified by Biolog GN MicroPlates. 
The four DMPD-degrading bacterial isolates showing larger percentage of 
DMPD removal were found to be alt Gram-negative. They were then identified by 
Biolog GN MicroPlates. 
b. Biolog GN Microplates 
The results of identification of Methyl Red-degrading and DMPD-degrading 
bacterial isolates taken after 4-hour and 16- to 24-hour incubation were listed in 
Tables 10 and 11.

4.1.7 Correlationship of Dry Weight and Absorbance of Cells of Selected 
Methyl Red-degrading Bacterial Isolates 
The correlationship of dry weight (mg/ml) and absorbance at 580 nm of cell 
suspension of j Serratia marcescens S-5, Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 and 
Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l were plotted in Figures 25, 26 and 27. The correlation 
equations of  A5gonm an<^ dry weight (mg/ml) of the three isolates were : 
For Serratia marcescens S-5 : 
y = 0.29269x3 - 0.61587x2 + 1.01599x - 0.00952 (r2 = 0.99385) 
For Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 : 
y = 0.11646x2 + 0.51793x + 0.01155 (r2 = 0.99407) 
For Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l : 
y = 0.2744x2 + 0.3783x +0.03665 (r2 = 0.99295) 
x is A58Qnm and y is dry weight of cells (mg/ml) 
The order of correlation equations were determined by best fitting for the 
empirical data. The dry weights (mg/ml) of these isolates in subsequent assays were 
calculated from the measured A5gonm 〇f【he cultures by these correlation equations.

97 a. In 0.05 M Phosphate Buffer (pH 7) 
Bot
h Methyl Red and ABA showed slight reduction in UV-Vis spectra in 
0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 7) over the tested period. The characteristic  peaks of 
Methyl Red were at 260 nm and 430 nm (Figure 28) and at 210 nm, 240 nm and 310 
nm for ABA (Figure 29). The UV-Vis spectrum of the DMPD-HC1 solution diluted 
with the buffer on the first day showed a high absorbance at 244 nm and relatively 
low absorbance at 310, 521 and 553 nm, For DMPD, it also showed the similar 
characteristic  peaks at 245, 520 and 561 nm as DMPD HC1. On the second day, the 
characteristic  peak at 244 nm of DMPD-HC1 disappeared while peaks at 295 nm and 
551 nm appeared. This peak pattern remained the same but gradually decreased in 
absorbance in the rest of tested time period (Figure 30). This was the same 
phenomenon for DMPD (Figure 31). On the other hand, when the DMPD and 
DMPD HC1 solution was diluted with 0,2 M HC1, the UV-Vis spectrum showed an 
overall low absorbance with weak characteristic  peaks at 280 nm and 393 nm for 
DMPD HC1 and at 278 nm, 400 nm and 530 nm for DMPD on the first day. On the 
second day, characteristic  peaks at 240 nm, 294 nm and 570 nm for DMPD HC1 and 
241 nm, 295 nm and 563 nm for DMPD appeared. These peak patterns remained the 
same without significant change in absorbance in the rest of tested time period 
(Figure 32 and Figure 33). 
b. In 0.2 M Hydrochloric Acid 
Both Methyl Red and ABA showed very slight reduction in UV-Vis spectra 
in 0.2 M HC1 over the tested period. The characteristic peaks of Methyl Red were at 
220 nm, 287 nm and 520 nm (Figure 34) and at 227 nm and 273 nm for ABA (Figure 
35)
. For DMPD.HC1’ characteristic  peaks at 221 nm and 272 nm were found on the 
first day. On the second day, both A221 nm and A272 nm increased to a high value. 
This peak pattern remained the same without change in absorbance in the rest of the 
tested time period (Figure 36).

107 4.2.2 Change of UV-Vis Spectra of Methyl Red and N,N-Dimethyl-p-
phenylene diamine at Different pH and Matrixes 
a. Change of UV-Vis Spectra of Methyl Red and N,N-Dimethyl-p-phenylene 
diamine at Buffers of Different pH 
The characteristic wavelengths of 5 mg/1 Methyl Red at buffers: Mcllvaine's 
citric acid-phosphate, KolthofFs borax-phosphate and S^rensen's glycine II 
(Appendix 2) of pH in overall from 3.0 to 12.7 were shown in Table 12. The Methyl 
Red solution at pH 3.0 to pH 12.7 were shown in Figure 37. UV-Vis spectra of 5 
mg/1 Methyl Red at pH 3.0 to 7.1 were shown in Figure 38. 
b. Change of UV-Vis Spectra ofN,N-Dimethyl-/?-phenylene diamine at Matrixes of 
Different pH 
Since it was found that both DMPD and DMPD HCI in 0.05 M phosphate 
buffer precipitated when the solution was stood for a few days at room condition, 
DMPD HCI was dissolved in matrixes with and without phosphate buffer to see if the 
precipitation was phosphate buffer-dependent and in distilled water and MSM of 
different pH to see if the precipitation was medium or/and pH-dependent. The 
characteristic wavelengths and the corresponding absorbances of approximate 50 
mg/1 DMPD HCI in distilled water and MSM at pH 2，3，4, 5，6，7，8, 9, 10，11 and 
12，an
d 0.05 M phosphate buffer and MSM containing 0.05 M phosphate buffer at 
pH 6，7 and 8 stood for one day were shown in Table 13. The UV-Vis spectra of 
DMPD HCI in MSM at pH 2, 4，6，7，8, 10 and 12 were shown in Figure 39. 
DMPD exhibited different colors, and so different UV-Vis spectra, at 
different pH. In distilled water, color of DMPD HCI at pH 3, 4，5, 6，7 and 8 
darkened with time (Figures 40 and 41). In MSM, color ofDMPD-HCl at pH 3, 4, 
5, 6，7，8，9 and 10 darkened with time (Figures 42 and 43). In 0.05 M phosphate 
buffer and MSM containing 0.05 M phosphate buffer, color of DMPD-HC1 at all the 
tested pH darkened with time (Figures 44，45, 46 and 47). DMPD HCI precipitated

116 in all matrixes on the second day except those in distilled water at pH 2, 10，11 and 
12, and in MSM at 2，10,11 and 12.. However, in MSM at pH 10，11 and 12, white 
precipitate was found. This may be due to the precipitation of mineral ions in MSM 
at high pH. 
When DMPD HCI was in the mixture of 5 ml 1 N HC1 and 5 ml 1 N NaOH 
(resultant pH 6.7)，the characteristic absorption peaks were approximately at 
wavelengths 293 nm and 512 nm (Figure 48). It exhibited different UV-Vis 
spectrum when in 1 N HC1 (acidic DMPD HCI solution) (pH<l) (Figure 49). 
However, it exhibited very similar UV-Vis spectrum as that in the neutral mixture 
when in 1 N NaOH (alkaline DMPD HCI solution) (pH>13) (Figure 50). When the 
acidic DMPD HCI solution was neutralized with 5 ml 1 N NaOH (resultant pH 6.82)， 
the UV-Vis spectrum of DMPD HCI (Figure 51) was nearly the same as that in the 
neutral mixture (Figure 48). When the alkaline DMPD HCI solution was neutralized 
with 5 ml 1 N HC1 (resultant pH 6.30), the UV-Vis spectrum of DMPD HCI (Figure 
52) was also similar to that in the neutral mixture (Figure 48).

For calculation of remaining concentration of Methyl Red, N,N-dimethyl-p-
phenylene diamine and o-aminobenzoic acid in the acidified cultures containing 
Methyl Red and its reductive cleavage products, the equation (8) to (17) were used 
to calculate the actual absorbances of three compounds at their characteristic 
wavelengths (Appendix 3). 
128 4.2.4 HPLC Separation of Methyl Red, N,N-Dimethyl-p-phenylene diamine 
and o-Aminobenzoic acid 
The characteristic  wavelengths of Methyl Red, DMPD.HCl and ABA in 
acetonitrile are listed as follows, 
Compounds Characteristic wavelengths at which 
give peak absorbance 
Methyl Red 287 nm and 495 nm 
N,N-dimethyl-/?-phenylene  diamine 250 nm 
o-aminobenzoic acid 248 nm and 337 nm 
The UV-Vis spectra of 10 mg/1 Methyl Red, 10 mg/1 DMPD.HCl and 10 
mg/1 ABA in acetonitrile displayed in Figure 55 showed that all the three compounds 
gave in overall detectable absorbance at 250 nm in this solvent. Detection 
wavelength for HPLC was thus set at this wavelength. 
The kinetic change of composition of mobile phase: acetonitrile + 2.5 mM 
phosphate buffer (pH 3) at which these compounds can be well-separated without 
unsatisfactory peak-spreading effect in the HPLC analytical column was worked out 
by trial-and-error as shown in Table 20,

137 4.3 Methyl Red Degradation by Selected Methyl Red-degrading Microbial 
Isolates 
4.3.1 Monitoring of Percentage of Methyl Red Cleaved and Degradation Value of 
N,N-Dimethyl-/?-phenylene  diamine and o-Aminobenzoic acid and Growth of 
Selected Methyl Red-degrading Bacterial Isolates by Spectrophotometric 
Analysis 
a. Effect of Glucose 
All three bacteria decolorized Methyl Red at an extent proportional to the 
concentration of glucose in the media. Serratia marcescens S-5 and Klebsiella 
pneumoniae  RS-13 showed higher cleavage ability of Methyl Red than Acetobacter 
liquefaciens S-l since after one day of incubation, the former two completely 
decolorized Methyl Red beginning at 1.0 g/1 and 0.5 g/1 glucose respectively whereas 
Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l could do so only at 5 g/1 glucose. Both Serratia 
marcescens S-5 and Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 could nearly complete the 
decolorization after one-day incubation. For Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l, curve 
pattern of Methyl Red cleavage was similar to Serratia marcescens S-5 and 
Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 after four-day incubation (Figures 70(a), 71(a) and 
72(a)). 
All three bacteria showed DMPD degradation, which was expressed by the 
Degradation Value (DV) of DMPD, after one-day incubation. The DV of them, 
however, decreased after four-day incubation, but showed an overall slight increment 
for Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 and Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l at the end of 
incubation
. DV of DMPD of Serratia marcescens S-5 declined, at the largest extent, 
to nearly zero in culture supplied with 2.5 g/1 and 5 g/1 glucose and its DV was 
highest in culture with 0.5 g/1 glucose after four-day incubation. RS-13 had the 
highest DV of DMPD at all glucose concentrations. It showed proportional 
relationship with glucose concentration in the range of 0 to 1 g/1 (Figures 73(a), 
74(a) and 75(a)). 
138 DV of ABA of the three bacteria showed that Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 
degraded ABA very poorly at all glucose concentrations when compared with 
Serratia marcescens S-5 and Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l, which degraded ABA 
equally well (Figures 76(a), 77(a) and 78(a)). 
On the first day of incubation, Serratia marcescens S-5 and Klebsiella 
pneumoniae
 RS-13 showed similar growth, which were proportional to glucose 
concentration from 0 to 2.5 g/1 and much higher than Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l 
did at all concentrations. Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l did not grow in proportion to 
the glucose concentration only on the first day. The drop of dry weight of cells of 
Serratia marcescens S-5 from the first day to the seventh day showed that cells of 
Serratia marcescens S-5 lysed quickly after attained a certain density. Whereas for 
Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 and Acetobacter Uqmfaciem S-l, they continued to 
grow over the incubation period (Figures 79(a)，80(a) and 81(a)). 
When compared the change of dry weight of cells in sample cultures (added 
with Methyl Red) with that of blank cultures (added with no Methyl Red), 
Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l grew much better in blank cultures. In addition, its 
growth showed a good linear relationship with glucose concentration. For Serratia 
marcescens S-5, cells in blank cultures did not lyse as they did in sample cultures 
(with Methyl Red). Growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 in sample and blank 
cultures were similar (Figures 82(a), 83(a) and 84(a)). 
b. Effect of  Ethanol 
Both Serratia marcescens S-5 and Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l achieved 
complete decolorization of Methyl Red at 0.05-0.5 % ethanol after one-day 
incubation. For Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13, it achieved about 60 % decolorization 
at all tested concentrations of ethanol except in the culture without it on the first day. 
At the end of incubation, Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 could completely decolorize 
Methyl Red at 0.25 and 0.5 % ethanol (Figures 70(b), 71(b) and 72(b)). 
139 Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 had DV of DMPD stayed at about 0.6 at 0.1, 
0.25 and 0.5 % ethanol throughout the incubation period. Both Serratia marcescens 
S-5 and Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l showed subsequent decline in DV with further 
incubation. The decline of DV of Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l appeared to be 
inversely proportional to the concentration of ethanol. DV of Serratia marcescens 
S-5 showed the greatest decline from about 0.8-0.9 after one-day incubation to 0.2-
0.4 at the end of incubation period at 0.05-0.5 % ethanol (Figures 73(b), 74(b) and 
75(b)). 
Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 degraded ABA very poorly at all 
concentrations of ethanol. Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l degraded ABA slightly 
better than Serratia marcescens S-5 did at 0.05 to 0.5 % ethanol (Figures 76(b), 
77(b) and 78(b)). 
Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l grew in proportional to concentration of 
ethanol from 0 to 0.25 % ethanol and had the larger growth rate than that of Serratia 
marcescens S-5 and Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 in both sample and blank 
cultures. Serratia marcescens S-5 also showed proportional growth with 
concentration of ethanol in sample and blank cultures but showed cell lysis at 0.25 
and 0.5 % ethanol in sample cultures at the end of incubation period. Ethanol did 
not have effect on growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 in both sample and blank 
cultures (Figures 79(b), 80(b), 81(b), 82(b), 83(b) and 84(b)). 
c. Effect of Ammonium Sulphate 
Both Serratia marcescens S-5 and Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 achieved 
complete cleavage of Methyl Red at all concentrations of ammonium sulphate within 
the incubation period. Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l could not completely cleave 
Methyl Red at any concentration of ammonium sulphate The cleavage of them did 
not bear relation to concentration of ammonium sulphate (Figures 70(c), 71(c) and 
72(c)). 
140 DV ofDMPD ofSerrada marcescens S-5 decreased from day 1 to day 4 and 
increased back to a value similar to that after one-day incubation at the end of 
incubation period. For Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 and Acetobacter liquefaciens 
S-l, DV of DMPD did not fluctuate so greatly as that of Serratia marcescens S-5 
did over the incubation period. Similarly, no significant relation can be found 
between the DV of DMPD and the concentration of ammonium sulphate (Figures 
73(c), 74(c) and 75(c)) 
Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 did not show degradation of ABA. This was 
expresse
d by the zero value of DV of ABA at nearly all the tested concentrations of 
ammonium sulphate After seven-day incubation, Serratia marcescens S-5 showed 
nearly 100 % ABA degradation (DV is nearly 1) at all concentrations of ammonium 
sulphate while Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l had DV of ABA ranged from 0.7 to 0.9 
at these concentrations (Figures 76(c), 77(c) and 78(c)). 
Growth of all three bacteria showed no relationship with concentration of 
ammonium sulphate in both sample (Figures 79(c), 80(c) and 81(c)) and blank 
cultures (Figures 82(c), 83(c) and 84(c)) 
d. Effect of Yeast Extract 
Serratia marcescens S-5 and Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 could completely 
cleav
e Methyl Red at all concentrations of yeast extract beginning from the middle of 
the incubation period. The percentage of Methyl Red cleaved by Acetobacter 
liquefaciens S-l was proportional to the concentration of yeast extract. It showed 
complete cleavage only at 0.5-1.0 g/1 yeast extract at the end of incubation period 
(Figures 70(d), 71(d) and 72(d)). 
Serratia marcescens S-5 and Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 had DV of 
DMPD larger than 0.6 on the first day. DV of Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l was 
from 0.1 to 0.7 which was in proportion to the concentration yeast extract. DV of 
them all decreased with further incubation at all the tested concentrations of yeast 
141 extract. At the end of incubation period, Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 had DV of 
0.6-0.7 at all the concentrations of yeast extract. DV of Serratia marcescens S-5 
showed decline as that in the assay on glucose effect to zero at 0.75 and 1.0 g/1 yeast 
extract. DV of DMPD of this bacterium was largest at 0.1 g/1 yeast extract after 
seven-day incubation. For Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l, DV remained at about 0.4 
at 0.25 to 1.0 g/1 yeast extract at the end of the incubation period (Figures 73(d), 
74(d), and 75(d)), 
Similarly, Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 degraded ABA very poorly at any 
tested concentration of yeast extract, Serratia marcescens S-5 had DV of ABA 
between 0.7 to 0.9 at these concentrations. DVs of Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l at 
0.1 to 1.0 g/1 yeast extract were between 0.8-0,9. It was 0.2 when there was no 
yeast extract in culture (Figures 76(d), 77(d) and 78(d)). 
All three bacteria grew in proportion to the concentration of yeast extract in 
both sample and blank cultures. For Serratia marcescens S-5, cell lysis took place 
quickly in sample cultures over the incubation period (Figures 79(d), 80(d), 81(d), 
82(d), 83(d) and 84(d)). 
e. Effect of Phosphate Buffer (pH 7) 
Both Serratia marcescens S-5 and Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 could 
completel
y cleave Methyl Red in cultures at all the tested concentrations of 
phosphate buffer within the 7-day incubation period. For Acetobacter liquefaciens 
S-l, it could only attain 80-90 % Methyl Red cleavage at these concentrations at the 
end of the incubation period (Figures 70(e), 71(e) and 72(e)). 
Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 had DV of DMPD higher than Serratia 
marcescens S-5 and Acetobacter liqmfaciem S-l throughout the incubation period 
at all concentrations of phosphate buffer. Its DV reduced slightly with time. 
Serratia marcescens S-5 showed decline in DV during the first half of incubation 
period and the DV then increased back to the value similar to that on the first day at 
142 the end of incubation. DV of DMPD of Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l was generally 
lower than those of the other two bacteria at the end of incubation period (Figures 
v 73(e), 74(e) and 75(e)). 
Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 showed almost no degradation of ABA over 
the whole period. Serratia marcescens S-5 could degrade almost all ABA at all 
concentrations of phosphate buffer. DVs of ABA of Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l 
were 0.7-0.9 in overall at the end of incubation period (Figures 76(e), 77(e) and 
78(e)). 
The growth of all the bacteria showed no relationship with the concentrations 
of phosphate buffer, Serratia marcescens S-5 showed the highest growth rate but 
cells seemed to lyse quickly afterwards. However, this event did not occur in blank 
culture
, in which cell density stayed high throughout the whole period. At the end of 
incubation period, Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 had the highest dry weight in 
sample cultures. Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l had the lowest dry weight in both 
sample and blank culture over the whole period at all tested phosphate 
concentrations (Figures 79(e), 80(e)，81(e)，82(e), 83(e) and 84(e)). 
f. Effect of pH 
Serratia marcescens S-5 and Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 could achieve 
complete cleavage of Methyl Red at the end of incubation period at all the tested pH. 
Acetobacter liquefacietis S-l could completely cleave Methyl Red only at pH 6.5 
(Figures 70(f), 71(f) and 72(f)). 
DV of DMPD of all the three bacteria declined subsequently during 
incubation. The decline for Serratia marcescens S-5 was the largest: 0.6-0.7 after 
one-day incubation to 0.1-0.2 at the end of incubation period at all tested pH. DV of 
Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 declined from about 0.9-1.0 after one-day incubation 
to 0.4-0.7 at the end of incubation. DV of DMPD was largest at pH 7. Acetobacter 
143 liquefaciens S-l had the smallest decline in DV. The DVs were generally between 
0.3-0.
5 at pH 6-8. It was largest at pH 6.5 throughout the incubation period (Figures 
73(f), 74(f) and 75(0). 
Serratia marcescens S-5 had DV of ABA about 0.8-0.9 at the end of 
incubation at all tested pH. Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l had similar DV to those of 
Serratia marcescens S-5 except at pH 6. Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 hardly 
degraded ABA except at pH 6 at the end of incubation. Its DV of ABA was highest 
(about 0.3) at pH 6 (Figures 76(f), 77(f) and 78(f)). 
Generally, growth of all the three bacteria did not show obvious dependence 
on pH. Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 showed better growth in sample than in blank 
culture in overall. Serratia marcescens S-5 exhibited cell lysis in sample culture, but 
not in blank culture (Figures 79(f), 80(f), 81(f)’ 82(f), 83(f) and 84(f)). 
After the three bacteria: Serratia marcescens S-5, Klebsiella pneumoniae 
RS-13 and Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l had completely decolorized Methyl Red, the 
colorless cultures of them then turned into brown at a rate inversely proportional to 
the initial concentration of carbon sources, such as glucose and ethanol, in the 
cultures. It was found that when the culture remained colorless after seven-day 
incubatio
n period，it would ultimately turn into brown. Figures 85，86 and 87 show 
as an example that Methyl Red in the cultures containing 0.5 % ethanol was 
decolorized completely by Serratia marcescens S-5 within the seven-day incubation 
period. The culture remained colorless at the end of incubation. When the culture 
was let stand at the room temperature fiirther, the surface layer of the culture first 
turned into brown (Figure 85). The brown color gradually extended to the whole 
culture and this process took about one week to undergo (Figure 86 and 87). 
The similar event took place for Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l in culture 
supplied with 0.5 % ethanol and for all the three bacteria in cultures containing 5 g/1 
glucose initially.

159 g. Effect of Temperature at Static and Shaking Conditions 
Serratia marcescens S-5 and Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 could completely 
decolorize Methyl Red under static condition but could not do so under shaking 
condition at 22-23 °C, 30 °C and 37 °C within the incubation period. Figures 88-93 
show the change of UV-Vis spectra of cultural supernatants obtained from cultures 
of all the three bacteria incubated under shaking and static conditions at 30 °C within 
7-day incubation, 
Under shaking condition, the orange color of Methyl Red in cultures 
darkened and finally turned into brown during incubation. However, under static 
condition，the cultures turned into colorless first and subsequently turned into purple 
color. Culture of Serratia marcescens S-5 turned into purple color earlier than the 
culture ofK. pneumoniae RS-13 did. When the purple static cultures were let stand 
at the same temperature after the incubation period, they finally turned into brown 
color
. For Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l, it could not completely cleave Methyl Red 
under both conditions, 
All bacteria grew poorly at 45 °C in sample cultures (Figure 97). Therefore, 
they did not cleave Methyl Red at 45 °C under both conditions. All bacteria achieved 
higher percentage of Methyl Red cleavage under static condition but the cleavage 
rate was faster under shaking condition at 22-23 °C, 30 °C and 37 °C. S. 
marcescens
 S-5 achieved complete cleavage faster under static condition. The 
cleavag
e rate of S. marcescens S-5 increased with temperature. For A. liquefaciens 
S-l, the cleavage rate was highest at 30 °C under both static and shaking conditions. 
K. pneumoniae RS-13 had the fastest cleavage rate among the bacteria under both 
conditions at all three temperatures. It could achieve complete cleavage faster under 
shakin
g condition than static condition (Figure 94). 
The high DV of DMPD firstly achieved during incubation by S. marcescens 
S-5 and K. pmnmomae RS-13 under both conditions at the three temperatures were 
similar. DV ofDMPD of these two isolates showed subsequent decline with further 
‘ ’ ‘ ‘ 
160 incubation but the DV of DMPD of ^ marcescens S-5 declined at a larger extent to 
a final value equal to or even lower than the final DV of Acetobacter liquefaciens S-
1. The decline occurred under shaking condition was earlier and quicker than that 
under static condition. K. pneumoniae RS-13 had the highest final DV of DMPD 
under both conditions at all the three temperatures among the other bacteria. A. 
liquefaciens S-l also had subsequent decline in DV but only under static condition. 
All bacteria showed no degradation of DMPD at 45 °C (Figure 95). 
DV of ABA achieved at the end of incubation by S. marcescens S-5 and A. 
liquefaciens S-l was about 0.8-0.9 under both conditions and at all the three 
temperatures except that under shaking condition at 37 °C. K. pneumoniae RS-13 
had poor degradation of ABA under both conditions at 22-23 °C. However, its ABA 
degradation ability seemed to become higher at 30 and 37 °C. DV of S. marcescens 
S-5 and A. liquefaciens S-l increased in linear proportion with time without 
appearance of stationary phase at the end of the incubation at static condition. 
However, they both achieved stationary phase under shaking condition after about 
two-day incubation at 22-23 °C and 30。C (Figure 96). 
The growth of all the three bacteria in sample and blank cultures were similar 
under static condition. However, except A. liquefaciens S-l, S. marcescens S-5 and 
K. pneumoniae RS-13 showed different growth in sample and blank under shaking 
condition at all the three temperatures. S. marcescens S-5 had the largest growth 
rate at all tested temperatures except 45 °C. It attained the maximum cell density 
after one-day incubation but exhibited cell lysis in both sample and blank cultures 
immediately. The extent of cell lysis was larger in sample culture than in blank 
culture. K, pneumoniae RS-13 also attained the maximum cell density after one-day 
incubation and then exhibited cell lysis as S. marcescens S-5 did but only in blank. In 
sample culture, K. pmvmomae RS-13 exhibited continuous growth without decline 
throughout the whole incubation period. At 45 °C, only liquefaciens S-l showed 
obvious growth (Figures 97 and 98).

174 4.3.2 Study of Degradation Products of Methyl Red by Selected Methyl 
Red-degrading Isolates by HPLC 
After seven-day incubation, both static and shaking cultures were acidified, 
centrifuged and filtered to remove cell. The supernatant was first extracted with 
dichloromethane. The aqueous layer was then made alkaline and extracted again 
with dichloromethane. However, it was found that brown color substances formed in 
shaking culture and purple color substances formed in static culture after incubation 
were not readily extracted in dichloromethane. DMPD HCI prepared in control flask 
also could only partially extracted into dichloromethane. When the aqueous layer 
after extracted with dichloromethane was extracted with butan-l-ol, brown color and 
purple color substances as well as DMPD remained in the aqueous layers that could 
not extracted by dichloromethane could be extracted into butan-l-ol. However, this 
extraction still could not extract all of these substances present in the supernatant. It 
was shown by that the aqueous layer still carried color after both extractions. Since 
the boiling point of butan-l-ol was 118 0C’ butan-l-ol was hardly, but not 
impossibly, to be concentrated by a rotary evaporator operated at 85 °C, a 
temperature which was still not low enough to avoid any possible decomposition of 
degradative products in butan-l-ol. In addition, when butan-l-ol was injected for 
HPLC analysis, it was found that a number of diverse small peaks with a fluctuated 
baseline appeared in the chromatogram. These indicated that butan-l-ol was not a 
good medium polar organic solvent in the present study for extraction of medium 
polar degradative products of Methyl Red and for HPLC analysis. 
4.4 Degradation of Other Azo Dyes by Selected Methyl Red-
degrading Isolates 
Serratia marcescem S-5, Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13, Acetobacter 
liquefaciens  S-l, fungal isolate F(l) and F(2) were selected for this study. After one-
week incubation, it was found that only Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l grown under 
static condition could decolorize all the three azo dyes. UV-Vis spectra of the 
175 cultural supernatants with decolorized Procion Red MX-5B (Figure 99)，Procion Red 
H-E3B (Figure 100) and Procion Yellow H-E4R (Figure 101) are displayed in Figure 
102，103 and 104 respectively. All the three decolorized dyes only showed 
characteristic peaks at wavelengths between 220 and 340 nm. For Procion Red MX-
5B, the characteristic peaks occurring at 230 nm, 283 nm and 539 nm were replaced 
with a broad peak at 237 nm after decolorization (Figure 102). The characteristic 
peaks of Procion Red H-E3B at 216 nm, 238.5 nm, 291 nm and 512 nm were 
changed into two characteristic peaks at 237 nm and 297 nm after decolorization 
(Figure 103). Characteristic peaks at 252 nm and 302 nm of Procion Yellow H-E4R 
appeared after decolorization replaced the original peaks at 227 nm and 410 nm 
(Figure 104). The absorbances of these peaks appeared after decolorization were 
believed to be lower than the actual ones because it was found that there was dye 
absorption on cells of both bacterial and flingal isolates. It was shown by that cell 
pellets obtained after centrifugation retained dyes.

180 5. Discussion 
5.1 Isolation, Selection and Characterization of Methyl Red-degrading 
and N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylene diamine-degrading Microbial 
Isolates 
5.1.1 Isolation and Selection of Methyl Red-degrading Microbes from Dye-
containing Wastewater, Activated Sludge and Soil 
Activated sludge was firstly used as source for isolating Methyl Red-
degrading microbes. The major criterion for selecting microbial isolates with best 
Methyl Red-degrading ability was their abilities to decolorize or discolor Methyl Red 
at high concentration, and to tolerate high concentration of DMPD on agar plates. 
These characteristics  are believed to be important for selecting microorganisms not 
only, in a practical sense, able to decolorize or discolor Methyl Red at high 
concentration, but also able to survive at high concentration of DMPD, which was 
generated by reductive cleavage of Methyl Red by these microorganisms. 
Preliminary results of the present study indicated that isolates selected from this 
method may not necessarily be able to degrade DMPD generated. Since there were 
isolates which were selected by their good capability in discoloring Methyl Red and 
tolerating DMPD at high concentration, only able to reductively cleave Methyl Red 
but not able to further degrade the reductive cleavage products, selection process 
able to show the abilities of Methyl Red-degrading microorganisms quantitatively 
was worked out. In addition, in order to increase the chance of isolating the desired 
Methyl Red-degrading microbes, dye-containing wastewater and soil were included 
as sources for isolation. For these samples, selection of the isolates was based on 
the quantitative reduction of Methyl Red， which was measured 
spectrophotometrically,  by them in liquid cultures. This selection process conducted 
from simple plate selection to more laborious calculation of Degradation Value (DV) 
of DMPD and ABA at different concentrations of Methyl Red. This multistage 
181 selection on one hand aimed at carefully and cautiously choosing the possibly best 
microbial isolate for further study. On the other hand, it could avoid from spending 
too much time on pre-mature precise selection among a large number of 
microorganisms at an early stage. The primary selection of isolates was based on 
their abilities in decolorizing and discoloring Methyl Red in plates. It was because 
formation of halo zones could indicate that this isolate could completely degrade, or 
partially degrade this compound. Selection on agar plates were helpful in 
distinguishing the desired colony from those of incidental oligocarbophiles, which 
could be isolated if using enrichment culture (Bratha’ 1990), 
Since almost all studies concerning degradation of azo dyes reported that 
reductive cleavage of the azo bonds was the first microbial attack to the azo dyes, 
further selection of the isolates, which were primarily selected by plates, then based 
on whether their cultural supernatants containing the Methyl Red degradative 
products could give low absorbance at 200-340 nm. It was suggested by Bratha 
(1990) that the decrease of UV absorption at about 280 nm could be used to monitor 
degradation of various aromatic compounds, which give characteristic  peaks at this 
region due to their ring structures (Skoog and West, 1986), This selection could 
avoid from selecting isolates that only able to cleave (decolorize or discolor) Methyl 
Red. Decolorization (becoming colorless) or discoloration (changing in color) could 
be an indication for cleavage of the dyes. Preliminary results of the present study 
showed that decolorization occurred only at low concentration of Methyl Red. 
When the Methyl Red concentration was high, discoloration of Methyl Red took 
place instead of. 
In the final step of selection, isolates were selected by their abilities in actually 
degrading DMPD or/and ABA generated from the reductive cleavage of Methyl Red 
at different concentrations of Methyl Red in culture media supplied with low level of 
carbon and nitrogen sources (0.1 g/1 glucose and 0.1 g/I ammonium sulphate), in 
order to force the isolates to utilize DMPD and ABA as carbon and nitrogen sources. 
This rationale was based on that Ogawa et al. (1981 a and b, 1986) and Ogawa and 
182 Yatome (1990) confirmed that Pseudomonas cepacia 13 NA had better azo dye 
degradin
g ability under poor nutritional conditions. To ensure completion of 
degradation of Methyl Red by the isolates, the incubation period in the present study 
was at least one week. 
Table 4 shows that percentage of microorganisms that could grow on the 
Methyl Red selective plate was relatively high in Cho Kung Tam red and brown oily 
sludge. The result indicated that dye-contaminated sample contained more 
microorganisms able to tolerate high concentrations of dyestufFs. The relatively high 
percentage of Methyl Red-degrading microorganisms in activated sludge could be 
explained as that sewage is originated from a diverse sources and the microorganisms 
of multifarious kinds present in sewage and sludge increased the population of those 
having higher tolerance to dyestufFs, The extremely low percentage of Methyl Red-
degrading microorganisms in soil might be due to lack of any dye contamination in 
soil. 
The Degradation Value (DV) of DMPD and ABA (Figures 17 and 18) of the 
isolates were calculated basing on the concentration of DMPD and ABA remaining in 
the cultural supernatants of these isolates. Isolate 3(5) and RS 13 were the two 
bacterial isolates with the highest DV of both compounds at almost all tested 
concentrations of Methyl Red. A. liquefaciens S-l, a bacterial strain even though 
had relatively low DV of DMPD and ABA especially at high concentrations of 
Methyl Red, was also included as a reference strain. These three bacterial isolates 
were subjected for further study. 
5.1.2 Isolation and Selection of DMPD-degrading Microbial Isolates from 
Dye-containing Wastewater, Activated Sludge and Soil 
DMPD was reported as a mutagen by Chung et al. (1981) and could not be 
degraded biologically by Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l (So et al, 1990). Isolation of 
microorganisms capable of degrading DMPD was also the prime objective of the 
183 present study. There was no microbe could form halo on Mod SM plates inoculated 
with activated sludge which contained 100 mg/1 DMPD and even 50 mg/1 DMPD. 
Therefore, enrichment was attempted to enhance isolation of DMPD-degrading 
microorganisms. Figures 20-24 indicate that 50 mg/1 of DMPD was not toxic to all 
bacteria in the samples in enrichment cultures. Therefore subculture of enrichment 
culture was maintained at this concentration. The addition of 0.1 g/1 glucose and 
0.25 g/1 yeast extract in the enrichment culture was to provide carbon source and 
other cofactors or organics necessary for the initial growth of microorganisms 
(Bratha, 1990) and synthesis of enzymes for the biodegradation (Moon and 
Parulekar, 1991). After a number of subcultures, no bacteria could form clear zone 
on plates containing DMPD. However, color reduction of DMPD was observed in 
some enrichment cultures. This result might indicate that there were some 
microorganisms in enrichment culture could degrade or decolorize DMPD. 
Therefore, bacterial isolates of predominant population, which were believed to be 
potential DMPD-degrading microorganisms, were selected from each enrichment 
culture to study for the percentage of DMPD removed by them when grown in 
culture containing 50 mg/1 DMPD and 0J g/I or 1 g/1 glucose. Precipitated DMPD 
in culture was re-dissolved by addition of hydrochloric acid. The absorbances of the 
cultural supernatants of the Sib, BSb, BSd and ASb at 241 nm, 291 nm and 560 nm, 
the characteristic  wavelengths of DMPD at low pH, were measured to calculate the 
reduction of DMPD in the cultural supernatants. All isolates except BSb showed 
higher percentage of DMPD removal in cultures containing 0.1 g/1 glucose than that 
containing 1 g/1 glucose (Tables 9a and b). This results indicated that DMPD might 
be used as carbon source for these isolates and the presence of higher concentration 
of glucose discouraged them from utiGzing DMPD. The percentage of reduction of 
absorbances of DMPD by these four isolates were different at the three wavelengths. 
Percentage of reduction was greatest at A24inm. This suggested that DMPD was 
partially degraded or metabolized into another products, which showed different 
characteristic absorbances from that of DMPD. 
184 5.1.3 Identification of the Selected Methyl Red-degrading and N，N-
Dimethyl-p-phenylene diamine-degrading Bacteria 
From the ten selected Methyl Red-degrading bacterial isolates, seven of them 
were identified with acceptance (Table 10). Three of them were Klebsiella spp. and 
two were Salmonella spp. From the four selected DMPD-degrading bacterial 
isolates, three of them were identified with acceptance (Table 11). One of them was 
Klebsiella spp. Higher occurrence of Klebsiella spp. among the selected Methyl 
Red-degrading and DMPD-degrading bacterial isolates may be due to their minimum 
requirement of growth (Krieg and Holt, 1984). 
5.1.4 Correlationship of Dry Weight and Absorbance of Cells of Selected 
Methyl Red-degrading Bacterial Isolates 
Since in the present study the Methyl Red degradation of three selected 
bacterial isolates: S. marcescens S-5, K. pneumoniae RS-13 and A. liquefaciens S-l 
under different physical and chemical conditions were studied, the comparison of 
growth of them should be on one hand not tedious and on the other hand should 
enable reasonable comparison. The comparison of optical density of cell suspensions 
of them are not applicable because differences in size and especially color, if any, of 
cells of different bacteria leads to variation of optical density even though the cell 
concentrations or cell mass are equal. Therefore, correlationship of dry weight and 
absorbance of cells at 580 nm of each bacterium was worked out (Figures 25-27). 
The dry weight of cells (mg/ml) in the bacterial culture in the subsequent assay could 
then be obtained by simply measuring the A5gonm of the culture. 
185 5.2 Characterization of Methyl Red, N,N-Dimethyl-/?-phenylene diamine 
and o-Aininobenzoic acid 
5.2,1 Chemical Stability of Methyl Red, N,N-Dimethyl-/?-phenylene diamine 
and o-Aminobenzoic acid in 0.05 M phosphate buffer and 0.2 M HC1 
The investigation of chemical stability of these three compounds in 0.05 M 
phosphate buffer and 0.2 M HC1 could show that if they are still chemically stable in 
cultures containing this buffer over the incubation period and in acidified cultures. 
Comparing the changes of UV-Vis spectra of Methyl Red and ABA in 0.05 M 
phosphate buffer and 0.2 M hydrochloric acid, Methyl Red and ABA exhibited 
different characteristic absorption peaks in these matrixes and showed higher stability 
in acid (Figures 28 and 29). The larger extent of reduction of ABA in buffer than in 
acid showed that ABA was readily degraded by microorganisms present in the buffer, 
which was not sterilized (Figure 29). 
Both DMPD and DMPD^HCl exhibited changes in characteristic absorption 
peaks in first few days in 0.05 M phosphate buffer and 0.2 M HC1 (Figures 31 and 
31), DMPD and DMPD HCI showed precipitation in buffer after their UV-Vis 
spectrum exhibited no further change. This precipitation led to the reduction of the 
overall absorbances of the spectra of DMPD and DMPD.HCI. When DMPD and 
DMPD HCI in buffer were diluted with 0.2 M HCI, the characteristic absorption 
peaks changed. Comparing DMPD.HCI in 0.05 M buffer with that in 0.2 M HCI, the 
reduction of absorbances of spectra over the tested period was much smaller in 0.2 
M HCI (Figure 32). This was because DMPD HCI redissolved at low pH. However, 
DMPD HCI in 0.2 M HCI (Figure 36) could not develop to the spectra as that in 0.05 
M
 buffer diluted with 0.2 M HCI (Figure 32)，but had the spectra very similar to that 
ofABA (Figure 35). 
UV-Vis spectrum of DMPD.HCI in acidic solution was different from that in 
neutral solution, but UV-Vis spectrum of DMPD.HCI in alkaline solution was similar 
to that in neutral solution. When both acidic and alkaline DMPD HCI solutions were 
186 neutralized, the neutralized solution exhibited very similar pattern to that of the 
neutral solution. This showed that DMPD HC1 exhibits different UV-Vis spectra at 
different pH without losing its chemical identity. 
5.2.2 Change of UV-Vis Spectra of Methyl Red and N,N-Dimethyl-p-
phenylene diamine at Different pH and Matrixes 
Since Methyl Red was used as a pH indicator in laboratories, Table 12, 
Figures 37 and 38 showed that Methyl Red exhibited different colors and UV-Vis 
spectra at pH 3-7 and these appeared the same at pH 8-12 as at pH 1. The pH 
dependence of UV-Vis spectrum of Methyl Red indicated that measurement of 
Methyl Red containing cultural supernatants should be conducted in matrixes of same 
pH for correct determination of concentration of Methyl Red. Therefore, in the 
present study, cultural supernatants was diluted with either 0.05 M phosphate buffer 
or 0.2 M HC1 before the measurement of the absorbances. 
5.2.3 Change of UV-Vis Spectra of N,N-Dimethyl-/?-phenylene diamine in 
Different Matrixes at Different pH 
The investigation of change of UV-Vis spectra of DMPD HC1 in different 
matrixes at different pH was initiated by the observation that DMPD-HC1 formed 
precipitates in cultures after the cultures had been incubated for a few days. The 
same phenomenon occurred for DMPD. This precipitation might be due to the 
exposure of DMPD and DMPD-HC1 in solution to light and air because both DMPD 
and DMPD-HC1 are light and air sensitive and should be stored under argon and 
below 0 °C as indicated by Sigma chemical company Ltd. Paszczynski et al. (1991 
a) found that oxidation of sulfanilic acid, an azo dye, by ligninase produced an 
unstabl
e purple product，which precipitated upon exposure to air. This precipitation 
in culture rendered the determination of concentration of DMPD under-estimated by 
measuring absorbance spectrophotometrically at the characteristic wavelengths of 
187 DMPD. It was because there was reduction in absorbance of UV-Vis spectrum of 
DMPD as well as DMPD-HCI in 0.05 M phosphate buffer when precipitation took 
place (Figures 30 and 31). In order to solve the problem of precipitation, DMPD 
solution was adjusted to different pH and prepared in distilled water, 0.05 M 
phosphate buffer, MSM and MSM with 0.05 M phosphate buffer to see if 
precipitation was dependent on pH and affected by the medium such as MSM and 
phosphate buffer. When the structure of DMPD (Figure 9) is considered, the 
hydrophobic nature of it is attributed to one of its amine group, which is substituted 
with two methyl groups. The hydrophobicity of DMPD makes it poorly soluble in 
water unless it is made less hydrophobic. The results showed that precipitation did 
not occur at extreme pH. This could be understood as nitrogen atom could be 
protonated at low pH. This ionization made DMPD less hydrophobic and thus 
rendered soluble in water, However, the reason for its water solubility at high pH 
was not known. Since at high pH mineral ions in MSM precipitated and so for the 
subsequent studies, the cultural supernatants were acidified rather than made alkaline 
to re-dissolve any possible precipitated DMPD generated from cleavage of Methyl 
Red by the microorganisms before measurement of absorbance was done. The 
results in section 4.2.1 showed that all the three compounds were stable in 0.2 M 
HCl over three weeks and so acidification as a method to re-dissolve precipitated 
DMPD was feasible. Precipitation occurred in all tested matrixes and at a greater 
extent in phosphate buffer at pH 6, 7 and 8 than in distilled water and MSM. This 
might be due to that phosphate ions would complex with DMPD. 
5.2.4 UV-Vis Spectra and Standard Curves of Methyl Red, N,N-dimethyl-/?-
phenylene diamine and o-Aminobenzoic acid 
Standard curves of the three compounds in 0.05 M phosphate buffer and 0.2 
M HCl should be done to obtain the correlationship between the absorbances at the 
characteristic  wavelengths and the concentrations of them. The correlation equations 
188 were then used for calculation of concentration of these compounds present in the 
cultural supernatants by spectrophotometric analysis. The characteristic  wavelengths 
of the compounds were selected by that prominent absorbances could be given at 
these wavelengths, and that they did not give peaks of one compound significantly 
overlapping with peaks of other compounds. Therefore absorbances at 430  nm, 290 
n
m and 210 nm, and at 520 nm, 291 nm and 227 nm were measured to determine 
Methyl Red, DMPD and ABA in 0.05 M phosphate buffer and 0.2 M HC1 
respectively (Figures 53 and 54). 
5.2.5 HPLC Separation of Methyl Red, N,N-Dimethyl-/?-phenylene  diamine 
and o-Aminobenzoic acid 
Methyl Red and ABA dissolved poorly in water except in organic solvents 
and alkaline aqueous solution. DMPD also dissolved poorly in water except in 
organic solvents and acidic aqueous solution. DMPD.HCI dissolved well in water 
and organic solvents. Reversed-phase HPLC method was selected for the separation 
of these compounds. HPLC analysis has been widely used to measure known dyes 
and degradative products of dyes both quantitatively and qualitatively in many studies 
on biodegradation of azo dyes. Therefore, HPLC analysis was also included in the 
present study to accompany with the most simple method - spectrophotometric 
analysis - to calculate the concentration of DMPD and ABA remained in the cultural 
supernatants generated from the reductive cleavage of Methyl Red. There was no 
study except that of So et al. (1989) detecting Methyl Red，DMPD and ABA by 
HPLC analysis. However, acetonitrile (ACN) and water in equal ratio was used as 
mobile phase in isocratic elution in that study and it did not give adequate separation 
of the three compounds. In addition, detection made at 270 nm was also found not 
suitable because ABA in ACN and water gave zero and very low absorbance at this 
wavelength respectively (Figure 55). The reason for poor separation of DMPD and 
ABA in the previous study was that the composition of mobile phase did not suitable 
189 for separation of these two compounds, which both are aromatic compounds and 
similar in molecular weight, Therefore, they were eluted out of the analytical 
column almost simultaneously. Different proportion of ACN and water ranged from 
100 % ofACN to 20 % ACN had been tried in the present study but still did not give 
satisfactory separation of the two peaks. With the consideration that DMPD and 
ABA are basic and acidic compounds respectively, 2,5 mM phosphate buffer at pH 
3.0，as recommended by Snyder (1988), was used in the mobile phase for separation 
of the basic DMPD and acidic ABA, Moreover, a gradient elution was used instead 
o
f isocratic elution in the present study to obtain adequate resolution, a reasonable 
run time and easily detected (narrow) peaks of the three compounds. Figures 56 to 
69 show the process for optimizing the solvent system for separation of the three 
compounds. The initial higher proportion of buffer used in the initial stage of a run 
was to separate DMPD and ABA, The extent of separation was also related to the 
duration this phase of elution maintained. Increase in proportion of buffer improved 
separation of the two compounds but also increased spreading effect of the peaks. 
This phase was followed with an increase in strength of mobile phase to 100 % ACN 
to facilitate elution of the chemicals out of the column as quick as possible to reduce 
the peak spreading effect. Three minutes as the duration time was the limit because 
shorter duration time may pose a shock to the stationary phase of the column due to 
the drastic change of polarity of solvent. Wavelength of 250 nm was chosen for 
detection because the three compounds can be detected altogether obviously only at 
this wavelength. 
5.3 Methyl Red Degradation by Selected Methyl Red-degrading 
Microbial Isolates 
Except DMPD HC1, Methyl Red, DMPD and ABA are poorly soluble in 
water. So et al. (1990) studied biodegradation and decolorization of Methyl Red by 
dissolving Methyl Red in absolute ethanol to make up to 1 % ethanol in medium. 
190 Since Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l was isolated from screening medium (SM) agar 
plate with 100 mg/1 Methyl Red dissolved in ethanol, it was out of expectation that 
ethanol also imposed a selection of isolates capable of utilizing ethanol as carbon 
source. A. liquefaciens S-l can use ethanol as the carbon source (Krieg and Holt, 
1984), The number of carbon atoms of 1 % ethanol was equal to that of 10 g/1 
glucose. The presence of such rich supply of carbon source in medium might 
possibly discourage A. liquefaciens S-l from utilizing Methyl Red and its cleavage 
products DMPD and ABA as carbon source. So et al (1990) reported that A. 
liquefaciens  could decolorize Methyl Red completely up to 400 mg/1 within 17-hour 
incubation in both shaking and static cultures supplied with 1 g/1 ammonium sulphate 
as nitrogen source and 1 % ethanol as carbon source. By HPLC analysis, it was 
found that this bacterium was able to degrade ABA but not DMPD (So et al, 1989). 
This bacterium could degrade ABA was not difficult to be achieved because ABA is 
a precursor of aromatic amino acid, tryptophan, which can be further metabolized 
into acetyl-CoA. It is possible that A. liquefaciens S-l could not degrade DMPD in 
the presence of 1 % ethanol. Therefore, in the present study, both stock solution of 
Methyl Red and ABA was prepared by dissolving in 0.1 N sodium hydroxide. While 
DMPD was dissolved into 0.1 N hydrochloric acid. The commercial product DMPD 
is a reddish-violet crystal with melting point 53 °C or 41°C (Budavari, 1989). It 
readily liquefies at room temperature and is difficult to be weighed to a precise 
amount. Therefore, DMPD.HCI was used in the present study because it readily 
dissolves into water and is more easily to be quantified. 
The comparison of the ability of Serratia marcescens S-5, Klebsiella pneumoniae 
RS-13 and A. liquefaciens S-l in cleaving Methyl Red and degrading DMPD and 
ABA was based on the percentage of Methyl Red cleaved, Degradation Value (DV) 
of DMPD and ABA respectively. DV was defined in the present study on the basis 
of the following considerations : 
1) The ability of a microorganism to degrade DMPD or ABA depends on the extent 
at which it can convert Methyl Red into these two compounds. The higher the 
191 percentage of Methyl Red it can cleave, the higher amount of DMPD and  ABA 
ca
n be generated and thus be available for the microorganism for further 
degradation. This ability was designated as "fraction of Methyl Red reductively 
cleaved" (item c of section 3.1.2). 
2) The ability of a microorganism to degrade DMPD or ABA was based on the 
percentage of DMPD or ABA, which is generated from the cleavage of Methyl 
Red, degraded by it. This ability was designated as "fraction of DMPD or ABA 
degraded" (item c of section 3.1.2). 
Therefore, in order to assess the ability of a microorganism to degrade 
DMPD or ABA generated from Methyl Red, the two degradative abilities were 
associated by multifying fraction of Methyl Red reductively cleaved with fraction of 
DMPD or ABA degraded. The product of these two fractions was named as 
Degradation Value (DV) of DMPD or ABA. DV of DMPD and ABA were: 
[DMPD] degraded (mM) [ABA] degraded (mM) 
‘ : 、. and respectively. 
Initial [MR] (mM) Initial [MR] (mM) 
The comparison of growth of these bacteria in sample cultures and blank 
cultures was based on the dry weight of cells (mg/ml) of them in culture by 
measuring the optical density of the culture and calculating the dry weight with the 
correlation equations (section 4.1.7). The difference in dry weight of cells of a 
bacterium shows the effect of Methyl Red and/or the degradative products of Methyl 
Red on its growth, However, the presence of Methyl Red and its degradative 
products in culture made direct measurement of optical density of cells impossible. 
An alternative method was used in the present study to obtain the optical density of 
cells. It was to obtain the difference of A5gQnm of the culture and the cell-free 
supernatant. This difference was taken as the optical density of the removed cells. 
The comparison of the Methyl Red degrading ability of Serratia marcescens 
S-5, Klebsiella pmumoniae RS-13 and Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l made under a 
single or a few chemical and physical conditions may not truly reflect the difference 
192 of their abilities because these chosen conditions may be favorable to one bacterium 
and but  not to the others. Therefore, with the purposes of (1) making an adequate 
comparison of Methyl Red degrading ability among the three bacteria, (2) 
characterizing their Methyl Red degradation and (3) working out an optimal 
condition for Methyl Red degradation of each bacteria, the effect of chemical 
conditions, namely, concentrations of glucose, ethanol, ammonium sulphate, yeast 
extract and phosphate buffer at pH 7，and different pH; and effect of physical 
conditions, namely, temperature and dissolved oxygen (i.e. shaking and static 
conditions) on Methyl Red degradation of these three bacteria were determined, 
Spectrophotometric analysis was employed in monitoring percentage of 
Methyl Red cleaved, DV of DMPD and ABA, and growth of the three bacteria 
because of these several reasons; 
(1) Spectrophotometric analysis was preferable to Thin Layer Chromatographic 
(TLC) analysis because it can provide quantitative information about Methyl 
Red, and DMPD and ABA remained in the culture during incubation. 
(2) It was preferable to High Performance Liquid Chromatographic (HPLC) analysis 
because it was believed to be the simplest and most convenient method to enable 
comparison of the abilities of the bacteria by the above four parameters 
(3) In addition, for HPLC analysis, the preliminary results indicated that there were 
some degradative products of Methyl Red, which were believed to have high 
hydrophilicity, unable to be extracted from the sample into the organic solvents, 
e.g., dichloromethane and butan-l-ol. The incomplete extraction will lead to 
deficient analysis of Methyl Red degradation. This limitation was not borne by 
the spectrophotometric method because this method measured the culture 
directly. 
193 5.3.1 Effect of Glucose 
Reductive cleavage of Methyl Red into the products, DMPD and ABA, by 
microorganisms could be visualized by the decolorization of Methyl Red. The 
decolorization indicated that the chromophoric azo bond was cleaved by 
azoreduction of the bacterial cells. The decrease of amount of Methyl Red in the 
culture was in parallel with the decrease in intensity of orange color of Methyl Red. 
Complete cleavage of Methyl Red was shown by complete decolorization of Methyl 
Red. However, the reduction in color intensity was not observed in cultures which 
did not attain complete decolorization. For these cultures, the orange color of 
Methyl Red became brownish with time. 
The higher ability of Methyl Red cleavage of Serratia marcescens S-5 and 
Klebsiella  pneumoniae  RS-13 than Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l was probably due 
to the better growth of them than A. liquefaciens S-l in the Methyl Red containing 
medium. The proportional Methyl Red decolorization pattern of liquefaciens S-l 
did not match its unproportional growth after one-day incubation might be due to 
that the cells could acquire higher reducing power from glucose of higher 
concentration. The dry weight of cells of A. liquefaciens S-l became comparable to 
S. marcescens S-5 and K. pmximomae RS-13 after a few day of incubation showed 
tha
t A. liquefaciens S-l grew slower than these two bacteria with glucose as the 
carbon source in the sample cultures (added with Methyl Red). However, this was 
no
t the case in blank cultures (added with no Methyl Red). The growth of A. 
liquefaciens S-l showed no poorer growth than both Serratia marcescens S-5 and 
Klebsiella  pmnmomae RS-13 and its growth showed a good linear relationship to 
concentration of glucose. This result suggested that Methyl Red and/or degradative 
products of Methyl Red inhibited A. liquefaciens S-l from utilizing glucose (Figures 
70 (a), 71 (a) and 72 (a)). 
The reduction of Degradation Value (DV) of DMPD of all the three bacteria 
from 1st day to 4th day of incubation indicated that DMPD generated from Methyl 
194 Red may not at once be able to be detected by measuring absorbance at its 
characteristic wavelength. It is because DMPD HC1, which was used as the 
standards in the present study was, purple in color, while DMPD immediately 
generated from reductive cleavage of Methyl Red, was colorless and was found not 
having similar characteristic  peaks as that of the purple color DMPD-HC1 standards. 
This probably led to calculation of high DV of DMPD. However, when the colorless 
culture turned into brown, the DV of DMPD decreased. The decline in DV of 
DMPD was greatest for S. marcescens S-5 to near zero at 2.5 g/1 and 5.0 g/1 glucose. 
This showed that high concentration of glucose inhibited S. marcescens S-5 from 
using DMPD as carbon source. DV of both K. pmiimoniae RS-13 and A. 
liquefaciem S-l was high at high concentration of glucose and it might be due to the 
larger cell number as the curve pattern of DV was in parallel to that of growth to the 
concentration of glucose (Figures 73 (a), 74 (a) and 75 (a)). 
Comparatively, the DV of ABA o^S. marcescens S-5 and A. liquefaciens S-l 
were higher than their DV of DMPD. This result suggested that these two bacteria 
degraded ABA more readily than DMPD. The higher DV of ABA at high 
concentration of glucose might also be due to higher bacterial population. However, 
K. pneumoniae RS-13 showed very poor ability in degrading ABA (Figures 76 (a), 
77 (a) and 78 (a)). 
That S. marcescens S-5 exhibited significant cell lysis in sample cultures but 
not in blank culture showed that Methyl Red and/or its degradative products might 
be detrimental to the cell maintenance ability of S. marcescens S-5. The growth of 
K. pneumoniae RS-13 in sample and blank cultures were similar. This results 
suggested that 100 mg/1 Methyl Red did not inhibit growth of K.  pneumoniae RS-13 
(Figure
s 79 (a), 80 (a), 81 (a), 82 (a), 83 (a) and 84 (a)). 
195 5.3.2 Effect of Ethanol 
K. pneumoniae RS-13 in sample and blank cultures with various 
concentration of ethanol had similar biomass. It indicated that this bacterium could 
not use ethanol for growth. However, growth of S. marcescens  S-5 and A. 
liquefaciens
 S-l were proportional to the concentration of ethanol. That A. 
liquefaciens S-l had the highest biomass gain among all the bacteria in the presence 
of ethanol could be explained as that it could use ethanol as the sole carbon source 
(Krieg and Holt, 1984). The percentage of Methyl Red cleaved showed similar 
pattern as growth of the three bacteria to the concentration of ethanol. K. 
pneumoniae RS-13 could attain 80-100 % cleavage of Methyl Red over the whole 
incubation period and this showed that the bacterium could gain reducing power 
from ethanol over the whole incubation period (Figures 70 (b)’ 71 (b) and 72 (b)). 
The tested bacteria except K. pneumoniae RS-13 showed decline in DV of 
DMPD in later stage of incubation. At the end of the seven-day incubation period, 
K. pneumoniae RS-13 had an overall highest DV of DMPD. No decline in DV of 
DMPD ofK. pneumoniae RS-13 indicated that DMPD generated immediately from 
Methyl Red might not be the colorless form of DMPD, which generated when 
Methyl Red was being completely decolorized. Therefore, they could be detected at 
the characteristic  wavelengths of standard DMPD-HCI. A. liquefaciens S-l had 
higher DV of DMPD than that of marcescens S-5 at all tested concentrations of 
ethanol. The reduction of DV of DMPD of liquefaciens S-l and S. marcescens S-
5 was significant and became steady at 0-0.25 % and 0-0.05 % ethanol respectively. 
The reduction was smaller and still undergoing at higher concentration of ethanol 
(Figures 73 (b), 74 (b) and 75 (b)). This might be due to that colorless form of 
DMPD could remain for a longer period at high concentration of ethanol, The 
colorless DMPD remained even after the seven-day incubation period. Since the 
colorless DMPD could not remain at lower concentration of ethanol, at which 
complete Methyl Red decolorization could still be attained, this results indicated that 
196 colorless form of DMPD might be reduced form DMPD, which was generated from 
Methyl Red after decolorization. The colorless form DMPD was then oxidized by 
atmospheric oxygen. When the available carbon source in  culture became exhausted, 
th
e colorless DMPD turned into brown color. This suggestion was supported by two 
observations: 
(1) As the culture turned colorless, the cultural supernatant was obtained and kept 
at refrigerator, it was found that the supernatant turned into purple shortly. 
However, it did not occur for the culture with cells and for the supernatant 
which was acidified with HCi. This could be speculated that DMPD could be 
easily oxidized in the atmosphere. The presence of cells prevented the reduced 
DMPD from being oxidized by consuming oxygen in culture. Reduced DMPD 
was also not easily air oxidized at low pH (Skoog and West, 1986). 
(2) By comparison of static and shaking cultures, it was found that complete 
decolorization of Methyl Red could be achieved in static culture but not in 
shaking culture at the same low concentration of glucose. This result could be 
explained that less oxygen dissolved in static culture and then reduction of 
Methyl Red could take place more readily. In shaking culture, there was no 
complete decolorization, but the orange color of the culture darkened to brown 
color. This brown color also reappeared in culture which was supplied with 
higher amount of carbon source such as glucose and ethanol after having been 
completely decolorized. Therefore, it could be speculated that when the culture 
was supplied with high amount of carbon source such as glucose and ethanol, 
and incubated under static culture, more reducing power, in terms of reduced 
FMN (flavin mononucleotide), produced by the cells (Gingell and Walker, 1971; 
Dubin and Wright, 1975 and Mason et al, 1978), and a low  oxygen tension 
coul
d also be resulted. These favored the formation of colorless reduced form of 
DMPD. 
Similarly, all tested bacteria except K. pneumoniae RS-13 could degrade 
ABA significantly. S. marcescens S-5 could degrade ABA better at low 
197 concentration of ethanol. Although A. liquefaciens S-l showed higher DV of ABA 
than S. marcescem S-5 did, A. liquefaciens S-l had produced much higher biomass 
than S. marcescens S-5. Thus S. marcescens S-5 might have higher degradation 
efficiency of ABA than A liquefaciens S-l (Figures 76 (b), 77 (b) and 78 (b)). 
5.3.
3 Effect of Ammonium Sulphate 
Both S. marcescens S-5 and K. pneumoniae RS-13 could completely cleave 
Methyl Red at all tested concentrations of ammonium sulphate but A. liquefaciens S-
1 could not, It was found that ammonium sulphate played no significant role in 
Methyl Red cleavage for the three bacteria in the presence of 0.5 g/1 glucose and 
0.25 g/1 yeast extract which were added in the medium as basal nutrients. It was 
believed that these glucose and yeast extract could already supply adequate carbon 
and nitrogen source for S. marcescem S-5 and K. pnemnowae RS-13 to cleave 100 
mg/1 Methyl Red. However, these supplements could not provide enough carbon and 
nitroge
n source for A. liquefaciens S-l to completely cleave 100 mg/1 Methyl Red 
(Figures 70 (c)，71  (c) and 72 (c)). 
Similarly, K. pneumoniae RS-13 had the highest DV of DMPD at all 
concentrations of ammonium sulphate. This results suggested that this bacterium 
could degrade DMPD better than the other two bacteria with very low amount of 
ammonium sulphate. Although S. marcescem S-5 had lowest DV of DMPD after 
four-day incubation, the DV of DMPD of it increased at the end of the incubation 
and became greater than that of A. liquefaciens S-l. Only K. pneumoniae RS-13 
could not degrade ABA. K. pneumoniae RS-13 had higher biomass gain in sample 
cultures than in blank cultures. Since it did not degrade ABA, the higher biomass 
gain of this bacterium in sample cultures could suggest its utilization of DMPD as the 
carbon source (Figures 73 (c) to 84 (c)). 
198 5.3.4 Effect of Yeast Extract 
Both S. marcescens S-5 and K. pneumoniae RS-13 could completely cleave 
Methyl Red at all tested concentrations of yeast extract. This result showed that 
these two bacteria could completely cleave Methyl Red even only in the presence of 
0.5 g/1 glucose without any yeast extract. The percentage of Methyl Red cleaved by 
A. liquefaciens S-l was proportional to the concentration of yeast extract in culture. 
This might be due to the increase of cell population which could cleave more Methyl 
Red (Figures 70 (d), 71 _ and 72 (d)). 
K. pneumoniae RS-13 still exhibited the highest ability in degrading DMPD 
and this ability did not reduce at high concentration of yeast extract. The slightly 
greater biomass in sample culture than in blank culture indicated that this bacterium 
could  utilize DMPD. However，S. marcescens S-5 could not use DMPD. Yeast 
extrac
t gave similar effect as glucose in discouraging this bacterium from degrading 
DMPD. For A. liquefaciens S-L，yeast extract did not seem to inhibit its DMPD 
degrading ability (Figures 73 (d)，74  (d) and 75 (d)). 
K. pneumoniae RS-13 did not readily degrade ABA. Although both S. 
marcescens  S-5 and A. liquefaciens S-l showed equally well in degrading ABA, A. 
liquefaciens  S-l was not like S. marcescens S-5 in that it could degrade ABA even at 
low concentration of yeast extract (Figures 76 (d), 77 (d) and 78 (d)). 
S. marcescens S-5 exhibited significant cell lysis in sample culture, which did 
no
t occur in blank cultures, so that this again implied that Methyl Red and/or 
degradative products of Methyl Red may decrease the cell maintenance ability of S. 
marcescem S-5. The similar biomass gain in sample and blank cultures of A. 
liquefaciens S-l showed that Methyl Red and/or its degradative products did not 
inhibit its utilization of yeast extract (Figures 79 (d), 80 (d)’ 81 (d)，82  (d), 83 (d) 
and 84 (d)). 
199 5.3.5 Effect of Phosphate Buffer (pH 7) 
Since pH of the culture could not be maintained if no phosphate buffer was 
added, the effect of no phosphate on Methyl Red degradation was not studied. 
That both S. marcescens S-5 and K. pneumoniae RS-13 could completely 
cleav
e Methyl Red at all concentrations of phosphate buffer at pH 7 showed that the 
tested concentration of phosphate did not have effect on the Methyl Red cleavage of 
these two bacteria grown with 0.5 g/1 glucose and 0.25 g/1 yeast extract. Similarly, 
cleavage of Methyl Red by A, liquefaciens S- l bore no relation to concentration of 
phosphate buffer (Figures 70 (e), 71 (e) and 72 (e)). 
DV of DMPD of S. marcescens S-5 increased later on after it had declined 
during the first few days of incubation to a value higher than A. liquefaciens S-l. 
This event also took place in the assay investigating the effect of ammonium 
sulphate on Methyl Red degradation. Since both cultures were supplied with 0.5 g/1 
glucose
, It implied that S. marcescens S-5 showed better DMPD degrading ability 
than A.  liquefaciem when the culture was supplied with low concentration of carbon 
source (Figures 73 (e), 74 (e) and 75 (e)). 
Similarly, S. marcescens S-5 had better ABA degrading ability than A. 
liquefaciens S-l at low concentration of carbon source because it showed nearly 
complete degradation of ABA at all tested concentrations of phosphate buffer. The 
same event also occurred in the assay investigating the effect of ammonium sulphate 
(Figures 76 (e)，77  (e) and 78 (e)). 
The DMPD-degrading ability of K. pneumoniae RS-13 may once again be 
proved because it showed slightly better growth in sample culture than in blank 
culture. For S. marcescens S-5, the significant cell lysis occurred in sample culture 
but not in blank culture once again was thought to be the effect of Methyl Red and/or 
the degradative products of Methyl Red on weakening its cell maintenance ability 
(Figures 79 (e)，80  (e)，81  (e), 82 (e), 83 (e) and 84 (e)). 
200 5.3.6 Effect of pH 
In blank cultures, all three bacteria did not show difference in growth at 
different pH. However, in the sample culture, growth of K. pneumoniae RS-13 
seemed to be favored at lower pH among the five tested pH. Methyl Red and/or its 
degradative products in sample cultures at all tested pH still exhibited negative effect 
on the cell maintenance ability of S. marcescens  S-5 (Figures 79 (f), 80 (f), 81 (f), 82 
(f)
, 83 (f) and 84 (f)). 
S. marcescens S-5 could completely cleave Methyl Red at all the tested pH 
whereas K. pneumoniae RS-13 could do so only at pH 6.5-7 at the end of the seven-
day incubation. A. liquefaciens S-l showed higher ability in Methyl Red cleavage at 
pH 6.5 because it could completely cleave Methyl Red only at pH 6.5 (Figures 70 (f), 
71 (f) and 72 (f)). 
K. pneumoniae RS-13 also exhibited the highest DMPD degrading ability 
than the other two bacteria at all tested pH except 6,0, At the end of incubation, it 
showed highest DV of DMPD at pH 7.0. For the other two bacteria, they both 
showed similar trend of effect of pH on DV of DMPD and it was highest at pH 6.5 
(Figures 73 (f), 74 (f) and 75 働. 
It was found that K. pneumoniae RS-13 degraded ABA better at low pH. 
This might indicate the reason for its better growth towards lower pH. S. 
marcescens S-5 exhibited ABA degrading ability equally well from pH 6 to 8. 
However, A. liquefaciens S-l appeared to degrade ABA equally well as S. 
marcescens  S-5 only at the neutral pH, i.e. pH 6.5 to 7.5 (Figures 76 (f), 77 (f) and 
78 (f)). 
It was found that S. marcescens S-5 only had poorer DMPD-degrading 
ability than A. liquefaciens S-l when the cultures were supplied with a high 
concentration of glucose (1 to 5 g/1), or yeast extract (0.25 g/1 to 1.0 g/1) and or 
ethanol This showed that the degradation of DMPD of this bacterium could be 
inhibited by the presence of a more rapidly metabolizable energy source, such as 
201 glucose. Also, this could explain why S. marcescens S-5 had the highest DMPD-
degrading ability among all the bacterial isolates at 100 to 400 mg/1 Methyl Red in 
the cultures supplied with only low concentration (0.1 g/1) of glucose (Figure 17). 
5.3.7. Effect of Temperature at Static and Shaking Conditions 
All the three bacteria could attain higher extent or complete cleavage of 
Methyl Red at 22-23 °C, 30 °C and 37 °C under static condition than under shaking 
condition. However, the rate of cleavage was slower under static condition. This 
was because growth rate of the three bacteria were higher under shaking condition 
(Figure 94). A larger population of cells grown could certainly cleave more 
molecules of Methyl Red (Figure 95). However since shaking condition also favored 
oxygen transfer in the culture, as when the culture was supplied with just a limited 
amount of glucose, a limited amount of reducing power, reduced FMN, generated by 
the cells, was discouraged from reducing Methyl Red by favorably donating its 
electrons to oxygen. Therefore, except K. pneumotiiae RS-13, complete cleavage of 
Methyl Red could not be attained under shaking condition. Nearly no Methyl Red 
cleavage was seen in cultures of all the three bacteria at 45 °C under both static and 
shaking condition. This was because these bacteria grew poorly at this temperature. 
Under both shaking and static conditions, all the three bacteria in overall cleaved 
Methyl Red faster at higher temperature except 45 °C. It was due to the faster 
growth of them at higher temperature (Figure 94), 
All bacteria except A. liquefaciens S-l showed a sharp increase in DV of 
DMPD in the early incubation period (Figure 95). All was followed with subsequent 
decline as seen in the results of the assays concerning the effect of chemical 
conditions described previously (Figures 73，74 and 75). The rate of decline was 
larger under shaking condition than under static condition at all temperatures except 
45 °C. However, the extent of decline was larger under static condition than shaking 
condition. As was described previously, static condition did not favor atmospheric 
202 oxygen to dissolve into the culture. The colorless reduced form DMPD generated 
from decolorization of Methyl Red in static culture was oxidized into purple oxidized 
form DMPD by atmospheric oxygen more slowly than in shaking culture. In shaking 
culture, the increase in DV of DMPD in the early incubation period of the two 
bacteria was not accompanied with decolorization of Methyl Red but turning into 
brown. This showed that even under shaking condition, reduced DMPD must firstly 
be generated from Methyl Red, but then it was oxidized faster than that in the static 
culture. The oxidized DMPD appeared from culture having turned into colorless 
under static condition was purple. However shaking culture containing high carbon 
source e.g.，0.5 % ethanol, which had turned into colorless, turned into brown rather 
than purple (Figures 85, 86 and 87). It was found that the purple color in the static 
culture also turned into brown color later on. It led to the thought that the brown 
color degradative products of Methyl Red was produced when Methyl Red was 
degraded favourably with supply of oxygen, as under shaking condition. 
For A. liquefaciens S-l, as it did not attain complete cleavage of Methyl Red 
under both shaking and static condition, it did not  show decline in DMPD as did for 
th
e other two bacteria which could quickly attain complete or nearly complete 
cleavage of Methyl Red within a short period (Figure 94). At the end of incubation, 
K. pneumoniae RS-13 showed the highest DV of DMPD (Figure 95). All the three 
bacteria showed zero DV  of DMPD at 45 °C because they showed very little growth 
a
t this temperature (Figures 95 and 97). 
Both S. marcescens S-5 and A. liquefaciens S-l degraded ABA at all the 
temperatures except 45 °C under both static and shaking condition. Both degraded 
ABA faster in shaking cultures (Figure 96). This was due to faster growth of them 
under shaking condition (Figure 97). 
K. pneumoniae RS-13 apparently showed higher biomass gain in sample 
cultures than in blank cultures under shaking but not static condition. It showed that 
this bacterium could utilize DMPD under shaking condition but not readily under 
static condition. Except 30。C at which this bacterium exhibited a great decline in 
203 DV ofDMPD in static culture, DV ofDMPD of which did not show obvious decline 
within the incubation period at 22-23 °C and 37 °C. It may be possible that the 
appearance of high DV ofDMPD of this bacterium during the whole period was due 
to that decline had not yet occurred. The expectation of this decline was not 
unreasonable because the high DV of DMPD could not take account of the similar 
growth of this bacterium in sample culture and blank culture under static condition. 
On the contrary, S. marcescens S-5 showed drastic cell lysis in shaking sample 
cultures, which was not seen in blank cultures. This showed that Methyl Red and/or 
the degradative products of Methyl Red could exert negative effect on the cell 
maintenance ability of S. marcescens S-5 under shaking condition, but not under 
static condition because the growth in the sample and the blank cultures was similar 
under static condition (Figure 97 and 98). 
These results which characterized the Methyl Red-degrading ability of these 
three bacteria under different chemical and physical conditions showed that A. 
liquefaciens  S-l, a bacterial strain isolated by So et al. (1990) which was found able 
to decolorize Methyl Red and degrade ABA but not DMPD, was found also able to 
degrade DMPD though at an extent lesser than ABA, This discrepancy from the 
result of So et al. (1990) might indicate that the DMPD-degrading ability of A. 
liquefaciens  S-l could be inhibited by a rich source of carbon, i.e. 1 % ethanol, in the 
cultural medium used in their study. 
Comparing with the DMPD-degrading ability of DMPD-degrading bacterial 
strains selected from DMPD enrichment culture and that of Methyl Red-degrading 
bacterial strains selected from the multistage selection. Methyl Red-degrading 
bacterial strains such as K. pnevmoniae RS-13, could degrade 60-70 % DMPD 
generated from reductive cleavage of 100 mg/1 Methyl Red in shaking culture with 
0.5 g/1 glucose after seven-day incubation. For the Sib, which was identified as 
Pseudomonas  gladioli S-l, it reduced about 33 % of 50 mg/1 DMPD in shaking 
cultur
e with 0.1 g/1 glucose after seven-day incubation. These results indicated that it 
will be more suitable to isolate a microorganism which is able to degrade DMPD by 
204 using Methyl Red rather than DMPD as the selective substrate. The reason might be 
that the highly toxic and hydrophobic natures of DMPD rendered itself not readily 
accessible to degradation of microorganisms. However, it might not be the case for 
selection by using Methyl Red since it was found that Methyl Red in shaking culture 
was turned into brown color readily after there was complete or incomplete 
decolorization of Methyl Red, whereas Methyl Red in static culture was turned into 
purple after there was a complete decolorization. This purple color, however, was 
gradually changed into brown. Therefore, the brown color substance(s) in both 
cultures might be the degradative products of DMPD and purple color substance(s) 
in static culture was very likely to be DMPD. The results in the present study 
indicated that the brown color substance(s) as well as the purple substance(s) were 
very polar because they could hardly be extracted by dichloromethane, but more 
readily by more polar organic solvent such as butan-l-ol. However, commercial 
DMPD was comparatively more readily extracted by dichloromethane than those 
generated from Methyl Red. This result indicated that the brown  substance(s) 
was/wer
e more likely to be the degradative product(s) of DMPD. Therefore, it was 
speculated that the brown color substance(s) was/were probably hydroxylated 
degradative substance(s) of DMPD by the action of oxygenase of the bacteria. For 
the more polar purple substance(s), it was very likely to be DMPD generated from 
Methyl Red, however, its polarity showed that it was not exactly the same as the 
commercial DMPD. This might imply that DMPD generated from reductive 
cleavage of Methyl Red might be more readily degraded by bacteria than the 
commercial DMPD was because of their higher hydrophilicity which rendered them 
more accessible to be degraded by bacteria.. 
205 5.3.8 Study of Degradation Products of Methyl Red by Selected Methyl 
Red-degrading Isolates by HPLC analysis 
The poor extraction of the degradative products in static and shaking culture 
by dichloromethane and only partial extraction by butan-l-ol indicated that these 
degradative products were quite hydrophilic. The partial extraction of commercial 
DMPD in control by dichloromethane at acidic and alkaline condition indicated that 
DMPD became rather hydrophilic in the extreme pH. This matched with the results 
(item b of section 4.2.2) that precipitated DMPD re-dissolved in low and high pH. 
This indicated that a more polar organic solvent should be used to replace butan-l-ol 
for extraction of degradative products of Methyl Red. The preliminary results in the 
present study showed that propan-2-oi will be a better choice. It is due to the 
following reasons: 
1. Boiling point of propan-2-ol was 82 0C，which is much lower than that of butan-l-
ol (b.p.: 118 °C), Then concentration can be done at a lower temperature that 
possible risk of decomposition of degradative products of Methyl Red can be 
reduced. 
2. The solubility of propan-2-ol in water was oo  g/lOOg1 whereas that of butan-l-ol 
was 7.45 g/lOOg. The higher polar property of propan-2-ol will favor extraction 
of more polar degradative products of Methyl Red (Furniss, 1989). 
3. The absorbance of propan-2-ol at wavelength 250 nm is 0.0132 while that of 
butan-l-ol is 0.0458 (BDH, 1991). The lower absorbance of propan-2-ol can 
reduce background noise to the HPLC chromatogram. 
Although the high water solubility makes propan-2-ol readily miscible with 
the aqueous layer, this disadvantage was found to be solved by salting out. 
l* Values for 25 °C. Values < 0.01 per cent described as insoluble. 
206 Therefore, it was found that the extraction process in the present study was 
still not adequate enough for preparing sample for HPLC analysis. It was believed 
that the employment of propan-2-ol as the organic solvent to extract degradative 
products of Methyl Red of higher polarity and to extract aqueous layer at neutral pH, 
which can reduce the hydrophilicity of DMPD, with dichloromethane will be able to 
improve the extraction process. 
5.4 Degradation of Other Azo Dyes by Selected Methyl Red-degrading 
Isolates 
Since it was found that cells of all these five microbial isolates adsorbed dyes 
when the cells pellets collected after centrifugation of the cultures were colored, the 
absorbance of the dyes after decolorized by A. liquefaciens S-l could not be taken 
directly for assessing the quantity and quality of the decolorized dyes but only could 
be used for studying the difference of them in characteristic  peaks from those of the 
parent dyes. 
It was found that only A. liquefaciem S-l could decolorize the three azo 
dyes: Procion Red MX-5B, Procion Red H-E3B and Procion Yellow H-E4R only in 
static cultures but not in shaking cultures (Figures 102, 103 and 104), In view of the 
more complicated structures of these three commercial azo dyes comparing with 
Methyl Red, it was not out of expectation that only one of the five Methyl Red-
degrading microbial isolates was able to decolorize the three dyes. Many studies 
concerning the decolorization of azo dyes had shown that to achieve the 
decolorization of azo dyes was not difficult especially under anaerobic condition 
because the azo-reductases involved seem to be rather non-specific (Meyer, 1981). 
However, it would be more difficult to achieve it under aerobic condition because the 
enzymes involved appear more specific (Zimmermann et al,’ 1984). Since 
degradation of a majority of aromatic compounds by bacteria was the conversion of 
them into catechol and protocatechuate, which are the last aromatic hydrocarbons 
207 before ring fission reactions, namely ortho- or meta- cleavage (Gottschalk, 1979; 
Doelle, 1975; Dart and Stretton, 1980; Smith, 1990). The conversion of these two 
intermediates undoubtedly requires insertion of oxygen atoms, by means of 
hydroxylation, to the ring substrate by the action of oxygenase. This oxygen-
requiring character of biodegradation of aromatic compounds showed the reason for 
the achievement of mineralization of azo dyes under aerobic condition (Zimmermann 
et al., 1984) but very few, if any, under anaerobic condition. 
Since the five Methyl Red-degrading microbial isolates were selected by their 
Methyl Red-degrading abilities under aerobic condition, that none of them could be 
found able to decolorize the three azo dyes under shaking conditions was considered 
reasonable because their azo-reductases might be rather specific towards their 
substrates under aerobic condition, When under static condition, A. liquefaciens S-l 
came to show its ability in decolorizing all the three azo dyes. This was not 
unexpected because the depletion of oxygen in static culture and the addition of 5 g/1 
glucose to the culture had provided a favorable condition for the bacterium to reduce 
the dyes. The inability of the other isolates to decolorize the dyes under this 
condition might then be due to the substrate specificity of their azo-reductases that 
they could not act on these dyes. 
208 6. Conclusion 
1. The multistage selection method employed in the present study could identify 
bacterial strains capable of degrading Methyl Red and its reductive cleavage 
products, N,N-dimethyl-/?-phenylene  diamine (DMPD) and o-aminobenzoic (ABA), 
significantly. 
2. DMPD removal ability of DMPD-degrading microorganisms isolates might be 
discouraged by the presence of glucose. It was found that DMPD might be partially 
degraded or metabolized into another products. 
3. Both DMPD and DMPDHC1 precipitated at neutral pH. However, the 
precipitate re-dissolved at low and high pH. DMPDHC1 exhibited different UV-Vis 
spectra at low and high pH without losing its chemical identity. 
4. It was found that the readiness of decolorization of Methyl Red by Klebsiella 
pneumoniae RS-13, Serratia marcescens S-5 and Acetobacter liquefaciens S-l was 
proportional to the concentration of carbon source in shaking cultures. The colorless 
culture containing decolorized Methyl Red then gradually turned into brown color. 
However, the rate of turning into brown color was found inversely proportional to 
the concentration of carbon source. It was found that decolorization of Methyl Red 
in static culture could be achieved at a lower concentration of carbon source. The 
colorless culture containing decolorized Methyl Red, however, gradually turned into 
purple color rather than brown color as in shaking culture. When the purple culture 
was incubated further, it finally turned into brown color. This result might indicate 
that DMPD immediately generated from Methyl Red was colorless, reduced form. 
This reduced form could remain long when the cultures contained high concentration 
of carbon source. The reduced form DMPD was then gradually oxidized by 
atmospheric oxygen into purple, oxidized form. Brown color substance(s) in both 
209 cultures were probably degradative product(s) of DMPD which were produced more 
favourably under shaking condition and were more hydrophilic than commercial 
DMPD. 
5. S. marcescens S-5 and K. pneumoniae RS-13 were bacterial strains isolated and 
selected for their highest Methyl Red-degrading abilities in the multistage selection. 
They could cleave 100 mg/1 Methyl Red completely at as low as 0.5 g/1 glucose, 
under static condition within one-day incubation at 37 °C and within five-day 
incubation at 22-23 °C. K, pneumoniae RS-13 could cleave 100 mg/1 Methyl Red 
completely even at a faster rate under shaking condition apparently at 22-23 °C and 
30 °C but S. marcescens S-5 and A. liquefaciens S-l could not. 
6. A. liquefaciens S-l could cleave 100 mg/1 Methyl Red completely only in culture 
supplied with 1-5 g/1 glucose，0.05 to 0.5 % ethanol or with 1.0 g/1 yeast extract after 
7-day incubation. 
7. Both K. pneumoniae RS-13 and S. marcescens S-5 could cleave 100 mg/1 
Methyl Red faster and at a greater extent than A. liquefaciens S-l in both static and 
shaking cultures supplied with 0.5 g/1 glucose. These bacteria could degrade Methyl 
Red when the culture with 0.5 g/1 glucose was added with no ammonium sulphate or 
no yeast extract, very low amount of phosphate (0.01M) and at pH 6-8. 
8. K. pmumoniae RS-13 could degrade DMPD at a greater extent than S. 
marcescens  S-5 and A. liquefaciens  S-l. 
9. S. marcescens S-5 had poorer DMPD-degrading ability than A. liquefaciens S-l 
whe
n it was grown in a culture supplied with high concentration of glucose (1 to 5 
g/1), or yeast extract (0.25 to l.Og /1) and or ethanol. This result indicated that 
degradation of DMPD by S. marcescens S-5 could be inhibited by the presence of a 
210 more rapidly metabolizable energy source. Its poorer performance in culture 
supplied with ethanol might be due to that this bacterium did not utilize ethanol so 
well as A liquefaciens S-l for growth. 
10. K. pneumoniae RS-13 degraded ABA very poorly. However, S. marcescens S-
5 and A, liquefaciens S-l could degrade ABA equally well. S. marcescens S-5 
degraded ABA better than A. liquefaciens S-l when the culture was supplied with 
low energy source. S. marcescens S-5 could almost completely degrade all ABA in 
culture containing 0.5 g/1 glucose with no ammonium sulphate at as low as 0.01 M 
phosphate buffer (pH 7). Its ABA-degrading ability was more or less the same at pH 
6 to 8. 
11. Results in the present study indicate that both DMPD and ABA degradation 
were inhibited in the presence of high concentration of a more rapidly metabolizable 
energy source, such as glucose, ethanol or yeast extract. Higher Degradation Value 
(DV) of DMPD and ABA in the presence of higher concentration of carbon source 
would probably be due to that the bacteria produced more cells at high concentration 
of carbon/energy source and so more cells engaged in the degradation of DMPD and 
ABA. 
12. A. liquefaciens S-l, a Methyl Red-decolorizing bacterial strain isolated by So et 
al (1990), was found to be also able to degrade DMPD, but at an extent lesser than 
ABA. 
13. K. pneumoniae RS-13 could degrade 60-70 % of DMPD generated from 
reductive cleavage of 100 mg/1 Methyl Red in shaking culture with 0.5 g/1 glucose 
after seven-day incubation. For Sib, which was isolated from DMPD enrichment 
culture and identified as Psendomonasgladioli S-l, could remove about 33 % of 50 
mg/1 DMPD in shaking culture with 0.1 g/1 glucose after seven-day incubation. This 
211 result indicated that it will be more suitable to isolate a microorganism which is able 
to degrade DMPD by using Methyl Red rather than DMPD as the selective substrate. 
14. The potential application of the pure culture of K. pneumoniae RS-13 in treating 
Methyl Red or DMPD generated from azo dyes is not discouraged by its inability in 
degrading ABA as the latter product does not cause any toxic effect to the 
environment. Since its DMPD-degrading ability was facilitated at low concentration 
o
f energy source, together with its good performance even supplied with very low 
level of nitrogen and phosphate source and at pH 6-8，this apparently favors the 
application of immobilized K. pneumojiiae RS-13 to treat Methyl Red or DMPD 
generated from other azo dyes in industrial effluents.

227 Appendix 3: 
Calculation of concentration of Methvl Red (MR\ N.N-dimethyl-/?-phenylene 
diamine fDMPD、and o-aminobenzoic acid (ABA) present in the acidified 
cultural supernatant containing Methvl Red and its degradative products 
1. Absorbances of the acidified supernatant used for calculation are A227nm, 
A291nm and A520nm-
2. Since it was found that the acidified cultural supernatant of blank (without 
Methyl Red added) gave a characteristic peak at 260 nm, which was 
proportional to the cell density of culture,八227謹  A291nm and A520nm ofthe 
sample cultural supernatant should be corrected from the absorbance due to 
cells
.

prominent A520nm g»ven by Methyl Red at same concentration (Figure 58).

b Absorbances obtained by calculation 
4. Since it was found that A260nm of blank was proportional to cell density of the 
culture, A227nm，A291nm  and A520nm (due to cells) of blank could not be 
directly deducted from the measured absorbances of the sample cultural 
supernatant at these wavelengths when the cell density of sample and blank 
cultur
e were different. Therefore, e.g., A227nm(^ue t0 ce^s) was calculated as 
shown below, 
A227nm(due to cells) = A227nm(of blank) x (A580nm*(of sample)/A580nm(of blank)) 
* A5gQnmls ^e optical density of cells sample (with Methyl Red) and blank (without 
Methyl Red) culture 
228 5. The correlation equations of absorbances at these wavelengths and concentration 
of Methyl Red，DMPD and ABA obtained in item b of section 4.2.3 are listed as 
follows, 
[MR] (mM) = 0.02208 A520nm - 7.97775 x 10_4 (r=0.99896).…Equation (8) 
A291nm = 8.140499 [MR] (mM) + 1.99173 x 10_3 (r=0.99993) . Equation (10) 
A227nm = 13.07807 [MR] (mM) + 0.012931 (r=0.99988)..…….• Equation (11) 
A291nm = 5.50666 [DMPD] (mM) - 4.20008xl0"3 (r=0.99855). Equation (13) 
A227nm = 4.93675 [DMPD] (mM) + 6.3999xl0-3 (r=0.99786).. Equation (14) 
A29inm = 0.15062 [ABA] (mM) - 1.5096xl(T3 (r=0.99055)……Equation (16) 
A227nm  = 10.05715 [ABA] (mM) + 0.02049 (r=0.99976) .•…"…Equation (17) 
6. When the concentration of Methyl Red present in cultural supernatant was 
calculated from A520nm(of MR) by equation (8)，A227nm(of and 
A29inm(°fMR)  can then  be calculated  by equations  (11) and  (10) respectively. 
7. The relationship of the concentration of DMPD and ABA present in cultural 
supernatant to A29lnm(of DMPD) and A29lnm(of ABA) can be shown by 
equations (13) and (16) respectively. 
8. .. Similarly, the relationship of the concentration of DMPD and ABA present in 
cultural supernatant to A227nm(of DMPD) and A227nm(of 处八)can  be shown 
by equations (14) and (17) respectively. 
9. Although A291nm(of DMPD), A291nm(of ABA), A227nm(of DMPD) and 
A227nm(°^^B^) could not be measured directly with spectrophotometer, they 
could be used for setting up simultaneous equations for calculating 
concentration of DMPD and ABA present in the supernatant.
