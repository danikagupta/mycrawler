Abstract
Nanocrystalline basaluminite [Al 4OH10(SO4)/C1(H2O)3–5] and aggregation of the e-Keggin polyoxocation [Al 12(AlO 4)
(OH) 24(H2O)12]7+, referred to as Al 13, have both been described to form in acid mine drainage environments. Although
the chemical composition is quite similar, their crystalline varieties signiﬁcantly diﬀer, demonstrating that various types ofAl-hydroxysulfates can form under similar conditions and that their respective formation is not fully understood yet. Here,
we report the occurrence of nanocrystalline precipitates that form naturally in a small alpine catchment in Switzerland where
an acidic mountainous stream (pH /C244) is neutralized successively after mixing with several neutral tributaries. The stepwise
neutralization in conjunction with the large amount of precipitates provide an ideal setting for obtaining new insights into (i)
the structure of naturally forming Al-hydroxysulfates, (ii) their formation mechanism, (iii) their role in controlling the solu-
bility of Al, and (iv) their ability to lower the mobility of As. Synchrotron-based high-energy X-ray diﬀraction and subsequentpair distribution function analyses demonstrate that these precipitates are structurally identical to basaluminite samples
obtained from acid mine drainage sites. In contrast, only minor amounts of tetrahedrally coordinated Al, as present in
Al
13, were identiﬁed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The precipitates are further characterized by elevated As
concentrations up to 600 lg/g, whereas other heavy metals are at background concentrations only. Given the low As concen-
trations in the stream from which precipitation occurs (<0.03 mg/L), high As concentrations conﬁrm that basaluminite serves
as a highly eﬃcient As sink, which is attributed to its high anion-exchange capacity. Chemical analysis of streamwater samples
in combination with geochemical modeling show that precipitation occurs instantaneously upon mixing with neutral streams.Moreover, our data reveal that the precipitation of basaluminite exerts a strong solubility control on dissolved Al concentra-
tions as manifested by the quasi-constant basaluminite ion activity product observed during neutralization from pH 5 to pH
5.9. We hypothesize that in our ﬁeld system, high ﬂuoride and sulfate concentrations on the order of 100 and 1–2 mg/L,

1. INTRODUCTION
Aqueous Al concentrations are controlled by the pH-
dependent solubility of primary alumosilicates as well as
the formation of secondary Al-hydroxide phases occurring
above pH /C244(Bigham and Nordstrom, 2000 ). In most
acidic systems, gibbsite and kaolinite are the most stablesecondary Al phases. However, at elevated aqueous SO
42/C0
concentrations, such as in the case of acid mine drainage
(AMD) and acid sulfate soils (ASS), Al-hydroxysulfatesare precipitated instead. Owing to their nanocrystalline
occurrence and hence poor crystallinity, the proper charac-
terization of these Al-hydroxysulfates as well as the charac-terization of precipitates from sites with diﬀerent conditions
is challenging. In the last years, Al-hydroxysulfate precipi-
tates forming in AMD and ASS have been mainly describedas basaluminite [Al
4OH10(SO4)/C1(H2O)3–5](Adams and
Rawajﬁh, 1977; Nordstrom et al., 1984; Ball and
Nordstrom, 1989; Bigham and Nordstrom, 2000; Joneset al., 2011; Sa ´nchez-Espan ˜a et al., 2011; Carrero et al.,
2015), but other typical examples include aluminite, zaher-
ite, jurbanite and alunite ( Bigham and Nordstrom, 2000;
Lee et al., 2002; Jones et al., 2011 ).
Originally, basaluminite was described as a new mineral
phase occurring in sedimentary formations with a well-
deﬁned crystalline structure ( Bannister and Hollingworth,
1948). This is inconsistent with nanocrystalline precipitates
observed in many diﬀerent locations aﬀected by acid water.
Farkas and Pertlik (1997) suggested that basaluminite
actually represents a microcrystalline variety of the mineral
felso¨ba´nyaite [Al
4OH10(SO4)/C15H2O]. This led the Interna-
tional Mineralogical Association (IMA) to discredit basalu-minite as a mineral. Carrero et al. (2017a) suggested that
the ambiguity about the nature of basaluminite arises from
the diﬃculty to characterize such nanocrystalline struc-
tures. They combined high-energy X-ray diﬀraction spec-troscopy and reverse Monte Carlo modeling, which
conﬁrmed the close structural similarity between basalu-
minite and felso ¨ba´nyaite. In addition, Carrero et al.
(2017a) suspected that the structural and chemical similar-
ities between these two phases could be fortuitous due to
the lack of correlation between spatial occurrence and for-mation conditions.
In addition to basaluminite, the precipitation of
nanocrystalline Al-hydroxysulfates has been described to
include the e-Keggin polyoxocation [Al
12(AlO 4)(OH) 24
(H2O)12]7+, commonly referred to as Al 13(Ulrich and
Po¨thig, 2000; Furrer et al., 2002; Kim, 2015 ). These authors
report that the precipitates may contain signiﬁcant amountsof tetrahedrally coordinated Al (Al[4]) that are close to
7.6%, the stoichiometric fraction in Al
13. Similarly,
Al-hydroxysulfate precipitates resulting from titration oflake waters originating from AMD and from titration of
aqueous ASS or AMD solutions have been described as
basaluminite ( Sa´nchez-Espan ˜a et al., 2011; Carrero et al.,
2015), or as aggregation of various Al-hydroxysulfates
including Al 13-bearing sulfates ( Totsche et al., 2003 ).
Although the chemical composition and formation condi-tion of Al
13-bearing sulfates and basaluminite are quite
similar, Al 13-bearing sulfate crystals ( Johansson, 1960, 1963 )
are structurally distinct from felso ¨ba´nyaite ( Farkas and
Pertlik, 1997 ) (see structural models provided in Fig. S1,
Electronic Annex ). This is relevant because the latter has
a chemical and crystal structure that is very similar to that
of basaluminite ( Carrero et al., 2017a ). Thus, various types
of nanocrystalline Al hydroxysulfates can form under
similar conditions and their respective formation is not fully
understood yet. Nanocrystalline Al-hydroxysulfates havethe potential to control the mobility of major (Al and S)
and trace elements (e.g., As and Se) and hence to aﬀect
the quality of surface waters ( Munk et al., 2002; Sa ´nchez-
Espan˜a et al., 2006; Liu and Zhao, 2009; Mertens et al.,
2012; Carrero et al., 2017b ).
In this work, we report the occurrence of nanocrystalline
Al-hydroxysulfates naturally precipitated over several hun-dred meters along a stream in a small alpine catchment in
Switzerland. The stepwise neutralization of an acidic stream
by mixing with several circumneutral streams along the ﬂowprovides an ideal setting for obtaining new fundamental
insights into (i) the structure of naturally forming Al-
hydroxysulfates, (ii) their formation mechanism, (iii) theirrole in controlling the solubility of Al, and (iv) their ability
to lower the mobility of As. To elucidate these points, we
present data from a large number of chemical water analy-ses, synchrotron-based high-energy X-ray diﬀraction analy-sis, nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy,
and results from geochemical modeling.
2. SITE DESCRIPTION
The study area encompasses a remote area with no min-
ing and very little other anthropogenic (i.e., agricultural)
activity at an altitude of 2300–2800 m a.s.l. located in the
Engadin area, Switzerland, close to the Swiss-Italian boar-der (Fig. 1). Geologically, it is part of the Languard nappe,
which belongs to the crystalline basement of the upper
Austroalpine unit of the Alps, mainly exposed in Eastern
Switzerland and Austria ( Schmid et al., 2004 ). Two main
rock types are exposed in the study area, (i) a chlorite
mica-schist of sedimentary origin, and (ii) a coarse-
grained, leucocratic metagranite ( Peters, 2005 ). In addition,
quaternary weathering products of these units such as
moraines and alluvial cones cover a substantial part of
the study area.C. Wanner et al./ Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 238 (2018) 252–269 253The precipitation of Al-hydroxysulfates is manifested
by white coatings on the bedload of the small mountain-
ous stream ‘‘Ova Lavirun ”(Fig. S2, Electronic Annex ).
The coatings are observed over a ﬂow distance of about1.1 km, whereas the thickness gradually decreases from
/C242 mm to just a couple of microns. Ova Lavirun origi-
nates ca. 600 m upstream of the ﬁrst occurrence of theprecipitates at the outlet of a small water pond with asurface area of about 100–200 m
2(Fig. S3, Electronic
Annex ). The pond is characterized by a slightly acidic
pH of about 4.5 and an elevated total dissolved solid(TDS) concentration of >1000 mg/L. The low pH
observed in Ova Lavirun is due to the oxidation of pyrite
occurring naturally in the ﬁner-grained portion of thechlorite mica-schist bedrock. This rock is exposed at
the origin of Ova Lavirun ( Fig. 1 ) and shows a typical
rusty patina from oxidative pyrite weathering ( Fig. S4,
Electronic Annex ). Upstream of the pond, kinetically
controlled pyrite oxidation ( Williamson and Rimstidt,
1994) and hence acid generation ( Evangelou and Zhang,1995 and references therein) is facilitated by the occur-
rence of slow subsurface ﬂow, which is manifested by
(i) the imbalance between superﬁcial in- and outlets at
the acidic pond, (ii) the relatively low slope in the vicinityof the pond (<10 /C176), and (iii) the occurrence of unconsol-
idated sediments (e.g., blocks and rocks from rockfall).
Along its ﬂow path, Ova Lavirun is continuously dilutedand neutralized by merging with several circumneutraltributaries characterized by low TDS concentrations
(Fig. 1 ). About 200 m downstream of the acidic pond,
the stream Ova Lavirun is forked into two fractions,which meet again downstream of the occurrence of the
ﬁrst precipitates.
Due to the high altitude, the study area is typically cov-
ered by snow from November to June. Discharge rates of
Ova Lavirun and its tributaries are at their maxima during
snowmelt in June ( /C210.1 m
3/s). In the subsequent months,
discharge rates are strongly variable in response to thecourse of atmospheric precipitation and temperature
variation.

3.1. Sampling
A total of 29 streamwater samples from 22 locations
(Fig. 1 ) were collected during two sampling campaigns in
2015 (September 21–22), and 2016 (July 1–2). Accordingto runoﬀ records in La La Punt Chamues-ch, approxi-
mately 10 km downstream from the study area, the Septem-
ber 2015 campaign was carried out when the discharge wasclose to the annual average (about 2.3 m
3/s), whereas the
July 2016 campaign was during the peak of snowmelt when
the discharge was slightly more than three-fold above aver-age (7.5 m
3/s) (FOEN, 2016 ). Leftover snow cover was the
reason why samples OL1–OL3 (i.e., acidic pond and its
inlets) could not be collected in July 2016. The pH value,dissolved O
2, electrical conductivity, and sampling temper-
ature were measured on-site using Hamilton industrial
electrodes with Knick Portamess-913 ﬁeld instruments.
After collection, three aliquots per sample were ﬁltered at0.45 lm and stored in polyethylene bottles. The aliquots
for the analysis of major ions and heavy metals were
acidiﬁed with 1 mL of 65% HNO
3. After transporting to
the laboratory, samples were stored at 4 /C176C. During the
July 2016 sampling campaign, one aliquot per sample was
additionally cooled using a cool box, avoiding signiﬁcanttemperature changes between sampling at 2–8 /C176C and
determining aqueous Al speciation by the Ferron method
as described below.
White precipitate samples from Ova Lavirun were
obtained by scratching from air-dried rock specimen
collected along the Ova Lavirun streambed using a stainless
steel spatula. It should be noted that the collectedprecipitates formed over a certain amount of time and
hence do not fully correspond to the collected streamwater
samples, representing one particular point in time.Moreover, we cannot fully exclude structural changes due
to dehydration occurring between sampling in the ﬁeld
and actual analyses.
The precipitates from Ova Lavirun were compared to
natural and synthetic basaluminite extensively character-
ized by Carrero et al. (2017a) , as well as synthetic Al
13sul-
fate. In that study, what Carrero et al. (2017a) called
natural basaluminite was precipitated by slow titration
under continuous stirring of an AMD solution from the
Tinto river (Iberian Pyrite Belt, SW Spain) using a 0.01mol/L Ca(OH)
2solution, as described by Carrero et al.
(2015) . Because the expression natural basaluminite is not
fully appropriate, this sample will be referred to as AMD-titrated basaluminite throughout this paper. Synthetic
basaluminite was prepared by drop-by-drop addition of
214 mL of a 0.015 mol/L Ca(OH)
2solution to 30 mL of
0.05 mol/L Al(SO 4)3/C118H 2O under continuous stirring,
according to the method described by Prietzel and Hirsch
(1998) . Each solid sample was washed several times with
deionized water to dissolve possible co-precipitated mineralphases. Synthetic Al
13sulfate was precipitated with excess
Na2SO4from an AlCl 3solution with Al/Si and OH/Al
ratios of 12 and 2.4, respectively, and containing about70% Al
13(Fig. S5, Electronic Annex ).3.2. Analytical methods
3.2.1. Streamwater analyses
Concentrations of major cations (Na+,K+,C a2+,M g2+)
and anions (F/C0,C l/C0,N O 3/C0,S O 42/C0) of streamwater samples
were determined at the University of Bern by ion chro-matography (IC) using a Metrohm 850 system. The detec-tion limit was 0.016 mg/L for anions and 0.1 mg/L for
cations and the analytical error was ±5% based on multiple
measurements of high-grade standard solutions (Sigma-Aldrich, Merck). Total inorganic carbon concentrations
were determined using a TIC/TOC analyzer (Analytic Jena
multi N/C 2100S) with a detection limit of 0.1 mg/L and ananalytical uncertainty of ±5%. The aqueous concentrations
of As, Al, Ba, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Zn, Si, Sr, Pb and Cd were
determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emissionspectroscopy (ICP-OES) using a Varian 720-ES ICP spec-trometer at the University of Bern with detection limits of
1mg/L for Mn, Ba, Sr and Zn, 3 mg/L for Al and Si, 5
mg/L for Fe, Ni, Cd and Cu, 10 mg/L for As, and 20 mg/L
for Pb. The analytical uncertainty is element speciﬁc and
within the range of ±5–10% depending on element concen-
tration and sample matrix, and based on multiple measure-ments of high-grade standard solutions (Sigma-Aldrich,
Merck).
The mononuclear and polynuclear Al species distribu-
tion in streamwater samples were determined at the
Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fish-
eries, Berlin using the Ferron method as described byScho¨nherr et al. (1983, 1987 ) andBertram et al. (1994) . This
photometric/kinetic method makes use of the fact that
mononuclear Al species react instantaneously with an
acetate-buﬀered ferron solution (8-hydroxy-7-iodchinoline-5-sulfonic acid) at pH 5. In contrast, polynuclear Al
species react by pseudo-ﬁrst-order kinetics to disintegrate
into mononuclear Al species before the detectableAl-ferron complex can be formed. For this study, Al
calibration solutions were obtained by dilution of a Merck
standard solution (1 g/L Al) into the concentration range ofthe water samples (0.5–50 mg/L Al). For analysis one mLper water sample was quickly added to 9 mL buﬀer and
3 mL Ferron solutions prior to starting the measurement
(accuracy ±2%) in 1 cm cuvettes at k= 368 nm within
30 s using a UV–Vis-scanning spectrophotometer from
Shimadzu (UV-2401PC). The kinetic curves obtained from
the Ferron method were analyzed according to the methodofScho¨nherr et al. (1983, 1987 ) modiﬁed by computer-
aided calculation. To do so, the absorbance data of the time
curves were converted into the logarithm of non-reacted Al.Subsequently, the concentrations of monomeric Al, and
polymeric species diﬀerent than Al
13(Alx) were determined
from the intersections of the tangents at t = 0 of the initial(Al
mono) and second linear part (Al x) of the converted time
curves, respectively ( Fig. S6, Electronic Annex ). The con-
centration of Al 13was calculated from the diﬀerence
between 100 and the sum of the concentrations of Al x
and Al mono. The actual type of the existent Al species in
the samples was determined from the rate constants, which
was calculated from the gradients of the two linear parts ofthe converted time curves. Such identiﬁcation is based onC. Wanner et al./ Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 238 (2018) 252–269 255the comparison with27Al NMR data from which it is
known that the ﬁrst linear part of the time curves with a
rate constant of about 0.12 min/C01is equitable to Al 13
(Scho¨nherr et al., 1983; Parker and Bertsch, 1992 ). The sec-
ond linear part with a rate constant of 0.002 min/C01
described as Al polyinScho¨nherr et al. (1983, 1987 ) and
Bertram et al. (1994) correspond to the Al 30polycation ﬁrst
described in the year 2000 ( Allouche et al., 2000; Rowsell
and Nazar, 2000 ). Moreover, it is known that transitional
polymers (Al tp) with rate constants between those of Al 13
and Al 30exist in addition to Al 13and Al 30(Bertram
et al., 1994 ). The fractions of aqueous Al species deter-
mined via Ferron kinetics or27Al NMR spectroscopy has
been assessed to be equivalent ( Changui et al., 1990;
Parker and Bertsch, 1992; Bertram et al., 1996 ).
3.2.2. Analyses of white precipitates
Elemental analysis of the precipitates was performed at
the University of Bern by digestion of 0.05 g of samples
in 5 mL of 65% HNO 3, following the protocol described
byCarrero et al. (2017b) . Subsequently, concentrations of
Al, S, Si, As, K, Na, Fe and Ca were determined by ICP-
OES. Sulfur concentrations were converted to SO 4as
inferred from the high SO 4concentrations and oxidizing
conditions in the stream ( Table 1 ). The combined H 2O
and OH content was derived from the diﬀerence betweenthe sum of the weight percent obtained for the elements
analyzed by ICP-OES and 100%, which was within
±3 wt% of the weight loss measured when exposing thesamples to 1050 /C176C during 2 h (i.e., loss on ignition).
The structure of the precipitates was investigated by
synchrotron-based high-energy X-ray diﬀraction (HEXD)
in combination with subsequent pair distribution function(PDF) analysis, as well as infrared (IR) and
27Al magic-
angle sample spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (27Al
MAS NMR) spectroscopy. HEXD and PDF were per-formed at beamline ID31 at the European Synchrotron
Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, providing a
monochromatic X-ray beam with energy of /C2478.3 keV
(k=0 . 1 5 8 3A ˚) in Debye-Scherrer geometry. The energy was
calibrated using a CeO
2standard (NIST 679b). Samples
were loaded in polyimide (Kapton) capillaries. The diﬀrac-
tion patterns were collected using a Perkin-Elmer ﬂat-paneldetector and were integrated using the software PyFAI
(Kieﬀer and Karkoulis, 2013 ). PDFs were obtained by
Fourier transformation of the structure factor (S(Q);Q
max= 27.0 A ˚/C01), with the background scattering
corrected using the software PDFgetX3 ( Juhas et al., 2013 ).
IR spectroscopy was performed at the Leibniz-Institute
of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries in Berlin. Five
to six mg of air-dried samples were ground together with
800 mg dried KBr (105 /C176C) and pressed under vacuum
conditions into disks of 20 mm diameter. Infrared spectrawere recorded with a Fourier-transform spectrometer
(IR-Tracer-100, Shimadzu) over a range of 400–4000 cm
/C01
with 2 cm/C01resolution and 100 scans. Since the recorded
IR spectra showed a low resolution, the absorption bands
were identiﬁed by calculating the second derivative.
Subsequently, band component analysis was carried outwith TOPAS-Academic ( Coelho, 2016 ) using a pseudoVoigt function (i.e., Gauss-Lorentz cross product) with a
Gauss-Lorentz ratio greater than 0.8 and a ﬂat background.
Wavenumbers of absorption bands were ﬁxed to the valuesobtained during band identiﬁcation, whereas relative inten-
sities and peak widths were reﬁned by non-linear least
squares for each spectrum. Fitting was undertaken untilreproducible results were obtained with a goodness of ﬁtsmaller than 0.1.
27Al MAS NMR spectroscopy was carried out at the
BAM – Federal Institute of Materials Research and Testingin Berlin, using a Bruker Avance 600 spectrometer with
4 mm rotor system operating at 156.4 MHz, 12.5 kHz
MAS, and a selective 90 /C176pulse width p(sel) = 2.5 ls. For
each analysis, 128 scans were accumulated. The proportion
of four-, ﬁve-, and six-fold coordinated Al were estimated
by calculating the relative intensity area below the peaksrepresenting the corresponding coordination states, whichare at about 64 (Al[4]), 36 (Al[5]), and near zero ppm
(Al[6]) chemical shift ( Furrer et al., 2002 ) assuming similar
quadrupole interaction for all sites. The recorded spectrawere ﬁtted with TOPAS-Academic ( Coelho, 2016 ) using
pseudo Voigt peaks and a ﬂat background. Peak
asymmetry was modeled using a circular convolution.
3.3. Geochemical modeling
Aqueous speciation calculations were performed with
the geochemical modeling software PHREEQC V3
(Parkhurst and Appelo, 2013 ) using the WATEQ4F data-
base, in which temperature dependent equilibrium con-stants are tabulated for the monomeric Al species Al
3+,
Al(OH)2+, Al(OH) 2+, Al(OH) 3, Al(OH) 4/C0, AlF2+, AlF 2+,
AlSO 4+, Al(SO 4)2/C0, and AlHSO 42+(Ball and Nordstrom,
1991). To assess the relevance of the polymeric Al 13com-
plex in our streamwater samples, the database was enlarged
with the e-Keggin polyoxocation [Al 12(AlO 4)(OH) 24
(H2O)12]7+by adding the aqueous complexation reaction:
13Al3þ+40H 2O=Al 13O4(OH) 24(H2O)127þ+32Hþð1Þ
Plyasunov and Grenthe (1994) have presented a model
for calculating the temperature dependence of the equilib-
rium constant for this reaction (i.e., log( K) value). Because
the sampling temperature of our streamwater samples iswithin 2–8 /C176C and the model of Plyasunov and Grenthe
(1994) predicts an almost linear dependence between 0
and 25 /C176C, we applied a linear interpolation to the log( K)
values tabulated at 0 and 25 /C176C(/C0117.24 and /C098.52,
respectively) to account for the temperature dependence
of the log( K) value of the aqueous Al
13complex.

3%o fA l total.C. Wanner et al./ Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 238 (2018) 252–269 257water classiﬁcation of Ja¨ckli (1970) , Ova Lavirun (i.e., OL)
samples correspond to a Mg -Ca-SO 4water type. With the
exception of sample OL15, all Ova Lavirun samples areacidic (pH: 4.1–5.9), characterized by high Mg, Ca, Al
and SO
4concentrations, a slightly elevated Ni, Zn and
Mn content, and appear on the same region on the Piperdiagram subplots ( Fig. 2 ). The lowest pH (4.1) and highest
elemental concentrations (e.g., SO
4: 1738 mg/L; Mg: 239
mg/L, Ca: 159 mg/L; Al: 40.1 mg/L) were observed at oneof the two superﬁcial inlets to the acidic pond (sample
OL1, Fig. 1 ). While the low pH and elevated SO
4concen-
trations result from pyrite oxidation, high Mg, Ca, andAl concentrations are due to the dissolution of alumosili-
cates such as mica, chlorite, and feldspars, which is pro-
moted by the low pH and consequently supported byincreased solubility ( Ghebremedhin, 2017 ). A closely
related two-step process (i.e., pyrite oxidation and subse-
quent dissolution of other minerals) has been addressed
to explain elevated SO
4, Ca, and Mg concentrations
observed in a similar high alpine catchment in Switzerland
(Bucher et al., 2017 ).
In contrast to Ova Lavirun, its tributaries (i.e., T sam-
ples,Fig. 1 ) show low TDS concentrations (<105 mg/L),
circumneutral pH values, and higher concentrations of cal-
cium and bicarbonate, although the water type is variable(Table 1 ). In each Piper diagram subplots, the T samples
plot on straight lines between SO
4/C0and Mg-rich, and HCO 3/C0and Ca-rich endmembers ( Fig. 2 ), demonstrating that they
represent a binary mixture. These endmembers are inher-
ited from the two main lithologies exposed in the study
area. Similar to the origin of Ova Lavirun, tributaries T1–T3 are exclusively aﬀected by the pyrite-bearing chlorite
mica-schist bedrock ( Fig. 1 ) and show the same general
water type (i.e., Mg
-Ca-SO 4,Table 1 ). The pH, however,
is higher (pH: 5.7–6.8) than along the upper part of Ova
Lavirun (pH < 5) due to the steeper slope limiting the sub-surface residence time and hence pyrite oxidation. In con-
trast, tributaries (T4–T7) are additionally aﬀected by the
exposed metagranite unit and/or its quaternary weatheringproducts ( Fig. 1 ). Both are calcite-bearing and pyrite-free,
and hence they generate waters of a general Ca
-Na-HCO 3
type, corresponding to the second endmember type.
4.1.2. Chemical evolution along Ova Lavirun
Due to the merging tributaries, metal concentrations
and pH of Ova Lavirun are continuously diluted and neu-
tralized as illustrated by the TDS and pH evolution alongits ﬂow path ( Fig. 3 a and b). Over the ﬁrst 800 m a strong
TDS decrease by a factor of /C245 is observed when Ova
Lavirun merges with tributaries T1–T3, whereas the pHremains below 5 due to the weak neutralizing capacity of
these tributaries (i.e., low HCO
3/C0concentrations, Mg -Na-
SO4waters). Merging with tributary T4 then causes a
strong pH increase of about 0.4 units and the pH reaches

samples collected along Ova Lavirun (OL samples), whereas diamonds refer to tributaries to Ova Lavirun (T samples). As example, Sample
OL15 is indicated by an arrow.258 C. Wanner et al./ Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 238 (2018) 252–269a value signiﬁcantly above 5 at location OL9 (Sept. 2015:
5.45; July 2016: 5.29). This pH jump is due to the rather
strong neutralizing capacity of T4 manifested by its ele-
vated HCO 3/C0concentration of up to 31 mg/L ( Table 1 ),
inherited from draining weathering products of the meta-
granite unit outcropping at the Western ﬂank of the peak
Piz Laviruns ( Fig. 1 ). Moreover, the pH jump coincides
with the ﬁrst visible occurrence of Al-hydroxysulfates, con-ﬁrming that the pH is the main driver for precipitation
(Furrer et al., 1992a, 1992b; Totsche et al., 2003;
Sa´nchez-Espan ˜a et al., 2011; Carrero et al., 2015 ). Depend-
ing on the discharge conditions, the pH may drop again
below 5 at OL11 upon merging with the Western fork of
Ova Lavirun (e.g., July 2016) before being further neutral-ized by tributaries T5–T7, also showing signiﬁcant HCO
3/C0
concentrations ( Table 1 ). At the last occurrence of the pre-
cipitates at OL15, the pH has increased to values /C216.5.Prior to the ﬁrst occurrence of the precipitates at OL9,
Al concentrations have decreased from /C2420 mg/L at the
outlet of the acidic pond (at OL3) to about 2.5–3.5 mg/L
(Fig. 3 c), consistent with the decrease in TDS and major
cation and anion concentrations ( Tables 1 ). Subsequently,
the Al concentration approaches zero, whereas the TDS
concentration only shows a minor decrease, approachingthe TDS concentrations of the tributaries ( Fig. 3 a).
4.1.3. Al speciation
The results of the Ferron method applied to streamwater
samples obtained from the two sampling campaigns are
shown in Table 2 . Most samples showed more than 90%
mononuclear Al. However, three samples collected in 2016along the section with visible precipitates yielded high to
very high portions (36–97%) of Al polymers with particu-
larly low and undeﬁned rate constants of 0.011–0.043 min
/C01.

and 2), and (d) logarithm of the basaluminite ion activity product, along the course of Ova Lavirun in September 2015 (red) and July 2016

of Al 4(OH) 10.43(SO4)0.79/C12.2H 2O (log( IAP)=4/C2log(a Al3+) + 0.79 /C2log(a SO4) + 10.43 x pH). Bars shown in (d) illustrate the calculated
contribution of the aqueous Al 13complex on total dissolved Al for the September 2015 and July 2016 sampling campaigns, respectively. Gray
domains illustrate the segment along Ova Lavirun where precipitates were visible.

Wanner et al./ Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 238 (2018) 252–269 259Since these constants lie between those of Al 13(/C240.12 min/C01)
and Al 30(/C240.002 min/C01) they are referred to as transitional
Al polymers (Al tp) of unknown structure ( Bertram et al.,
1994). Finally, in any of the samples the percentage of Al 13
cations with a typical rate constant of about 0.12 min/C01
was very low (0–3.9%).

The diﬀraction pattern and PDF features of the OvaLavirun precipitates are very similar to the AMD-titrated
basaluminite sample, demonstrating that the samples from
Ova Lavirun structurally are consistent with basaluminiteas described by Carrero et al. (2017a) . The PDF analysis
further revealed a coherent domain size of /C241 nm in both
samples, reﬂecting the nanocrystalline nature of theseprecipitates. In contrast, Al
13sulfate shows diﬀerent PDF
features as well as diﬀraction peaks, where only tetrahedral
S-O and octahedral Al-O distance (1.45 A ˚and 1.88 A ˚,
respectively) are clearly coincident in basaluminite as wellTable 2

4.2.1.2. Infrared spectroscopy. The IR spectra of two Ova
Lavirun precipitates collected at OL9 and OL11 are pre-sented in Fig. 5 in comparison to synthetic basaluminite
(Carrero et al., 2017a ) and to synthetic Al
13sulfate. In gen-
eral, all spectra show a low resolution reﬂecting a variety of
local environments and disorder. The range of the stretch-ing and bending modes of the SO
42/C0ions from 400 to
1200 cm/C01is characterized by two broad features, which
can be decomposed into component bands using the secondderivative. Due to the historical confusion regarding the
nature of basaluminite ( Carrero et al., 2017a ), however,
no unambiguous reference IR spectra exist for basalumi-nite. The reported IR spectra by Tien (1968) refers to
‘‘crystalline ”basaluminite without any details to distinct
bands or assignment and is hence distinct from the
nanocrystalline precipitates from Ova Lavirun. Therefore,and because it represents the purest of our samples, band
component analysis was exclusively done for the synthetic
basaluminite spectrum in the ﬁngerprint range of400–1250 cm
/C01(Fig. 6 ).
An undisturbed SO 4group with tetrahedral symmetry
(Td) has 4 vibrational modes: ѵ1= 983 cm/C01,ѵ2= 450
cm/C01,ѵ3= 1105 cm/C01and ѵ4= 611 cm/C01(Nakamoto,
1986). Within mineral structures, however, the surrounding
cations, OH groups, and H 2O molecules will distort the T d
symmetry of the sulfate anion. Distortion to C 3vsymmetry
lifts the degeneracy and 6 IR active modes are possible for
one sulfate site ( Adler and Kerr, 1965 ).Ross (1974) , for
instance, reports the following vibrational modes for theIR spectrum of potassium alum: ѵ
1= 981 cm/C01,ѵ2= 465
cm/C01,ѵ3= 1105 and 1200 cm/C01, and ѵ4= 600 and 618
cm/C01. In contrast, our synthetic basaluminite sampleshowed in the ѵ3as well as in the ѵ4region four modes
of the SO 4group ( Fig. 6), suggesting yet a lower symmetry.
Frost et al. (2013) discussed for the mineral creedite the
lowering in symmetry by chelation and bridging of the sul-
fate to water molecules in the hydration sphere of thecations. The symmetry reduction results in splitting of the
ѵ
3andѵ4modes into two components under C 3vand into
three components under C 2vsymmetry. More than three ѵ3
andѵ4modes suggest that both bidentate chelation and
bidentate bridging occur. Such reduction in symmetry was
also reported by Frost et al. (2015) for aluminite and the
pseudo alums with the end members halotrichite and pick-eringite ( Reddy et al., 2006 ). All these minerals crystallize in
the monoclinic crystal system like felso ¨ba´nyaite ( Farkas
and Pertlik, 1997 ) and have a reduced symmetry of C
2vor
less. Based on the four ѵ3and four ѵ4modes observed in
the IR spectra such reduced symmetry also applies to our
synthetic basaluminite sample ( Figs. 5 and 6 ).
Taking into account the IR data summarized above and
those of further Al-hydroxysulfates as listed in Table 3 , our
band component analysis ( Fig. 6 ) results in the following
interpretation of the synthetic basaluminite IR spectra(Table 3 ): the complex peak around 606 cm
/C01can be
resolved in ѵ2(SO4) bending modes at 438 and 550 cm/C01,
an Al-O vibration at 519 cm/C01and a series of ѵ4(SO4) bend-
ing modes at 606, 664, 678, and 715 cm/C01. Modes at 775
and 915 cm/C01, as well as at 936 and 978 cm/C01were assigned
to H 2O liberation and OH bending modes, respectively. A
portion of the band at 775 cm/C01may be due to the Al-O
stretching mode of the AlO 4unit in polymerized aluminum.
The peak around 1130 cm/C01comprises the ѵ1(SO4) sym-
metric stretching mode at 997 cm/C01and a series of
ѵ3(SO4) asymmetric stretching modes at 1058, 1102, 1148,
and 1223 cm/C01. Synthetic basaluminite further displays a
water bending mode around 1640 cm/C01, water stretching
modes at 3378, 3440, 3525, and 3549 cm/C01as well as OH
stretching modes at 3480 and 3585 cm/C01.
The detailed comparison between the IR spectra for
each sample type (i.e., Ova Lavirun precipitates, synth.
basaluminite, synth. Al 13sulfate) reveals structural diﬀer-
ences between Al 13sulfate and synthetic basaluminite,

1000–1200 cm/C01(Table 3 ). Moreover, the Al-O stretching
mode of the AlO 4unit at about 724 cm/C01(Kloprogge
et al., 1992; Bradley et al., 1993; Kloprogge et al., 2001;
Liu and Zhao, 2009 ) is not identiﬁed in synthetic
basaluminite, whereas it can be identiﬁed in synthetic Al 13
sulfate ( Table 3 ). In contrast, looking at the Ova Lavirun
precipitates it becomes evident that the IR modes of
synthetic basaluminite are completely reﬂected in the IR
spectra of the natural precipitates. Additional tobasaluminite, the natural precipitates show small bands of
kaolinite and gibbsite. In summary, results from IR
spectroscopy are consistent with the ﬁnding that the OvaLavirun precipitates consist fundamentally of basaluminite.
4.2.1.3. NMR spectroscopy. The
27Al MAS NMR spectra of
two Ova Lavirun precipitates and synthetic Al 13sulfate are
shown in Fig. 7 . Both Ova Lavirun samples display a
dominant and broad peak at about 7 ppm characteristicfor Al[6] and a high degree of structural disorder typical
for nanocrystalline phases. In contrast, only sample OL9
showed a detectable Al[4] peak at ca. 64 ppm correspondingto an Al[4] content of 2%. Such value is signiﬁcantly lower
than the 7.6% expected if the precipitates corresponded to
an aggregation of Al
13only. Similarly, both samples show
a distinct Al[5] peak at ca. 36 ppm corresponding to anAl[5] content of 2 and 6%, respectively, which was not
observed in the reported NMR spectra of synthesized
Al
13sulfates ( Fig. 7,Ulrich and Po ¨thig, 2000 ) and Al 13gels
(Furrer et al., 2002; Liu and Zhao, 2009 ). In contrast, anal-
ogous NMR results with distinct Al[5] peaks together with
Al[6] and small Al[4] peaks were observed for natural andsynthetic basaluminite ( Carrero et al., 2017a ), and during
investigations of the buﬀering mechanism of acid mining
lakes ( Totsche et al., 2003 ). Obtained NMR spectra are
hence fully consistent with a predominance of basaluminitein the Ova Lavirun precipitates.
The synthetic Al
13sulfate sample shows a strong and
sharp Al[4] peak at ca. 63 ppm ( Fig. 7) conﬁrming the pres-
ence of substantial Al 13. The broad peak at about -15 ppm
in the range of the Al[6] bonding sites is due to the presence
of Si in the solution from which precipitation occurred (i.e.,Al/Si = 12) or due to the presence of the d-Al
13instead of
thee-Al13isomer ( Pilgrim et al., 2017 ).
4.2.2. Chemical characterization
The chemical composition of two precipitate samples is
shown in Table 4 . Both samples are dominated by H 2O+
OH, Al, and SO 4at very similar concentrations. The chem-
ical composition is consistent with low-sulfate basaluminite,
and the average concentration of both samples yields a sto-
ichiometry of Al 4(OH) 10.43(SO4)0.79/C12.2H 2O, assuming that
SO42/C0and OH/C0are interchangeable as suggested by
Carrero et al. (2017b) . The average Al/SO 4ratio of 5.08
is higher than the one observed in basaluminite obtainedby titration of AMD solutions (2.7–4.1; Totsche et al.,
Fig. 7. NMR spectra of two precipitates from Ova Lavirun (OL9,

that have precipitated from neutralized streams at AMDsites ( Nordstrom et al., 1984; Ball and Nordstrom, 1989;

are further characterized by elevated Fe and As concentra-tions up to 1110 and 640 lg/g, respectively, whereas other
metals are at background concentrations only.
5. DISCUSSION
5.1. Al solubility control and kinetics of basaluminite
precipitation
To assess the controlling parameters of basaluminite
precipitation along Ova Lavirun, the ion activity productIAP of the proposed basaluminite stoichiometry
(Al
4(OH) 10.43(SO4)0.79/C12.2H 2O) was calculated in combina-
tion with our speciation calculations:
logðIAPÞ¼4logðaAl3þÞþ0:79logðaSO4Þþ10:43pH ð2Þ
With the exception of Sample OL11 collected in July
2016 and aﬀected by the Western fork of Ova Lavirun, all
samples from the section with visible precipitates (OL9–
OL15, Fig. 1 ) yield basaluminite log( IAP) values within a
rather narrow range of 32.3–33.3 ( Table 1 ,Fig. 3 d). For
these samples, our speciation calculations predict a minor
Al13content of /C2020% ( Fig. 3 d), which is consistent with
the minor contribution inferred from the Al speciationanalysis using the kinetic Ferron method. In contrast, no
Al
13is predicted for the samples collected upstream of theoccurrence of the precipitates (OL1–OL8). At ﬁrst, the
quasi-constant basaluminite log( IAP) values seem
remarkable, given the large variation in pH and SO 4and
Al concentration of these samples (pH: 5.2–7.3; SO 4:
82–220 mg/L; Al: 0.05–4.4 mg/L), as well as the variable
discharge conditions observed during the two samplingcampaigns. Eq. (2), however, demonstrates that calculated
log(IAP) values are strongly sensitive to the pH value,
whereas due to Al speciation they are much less sensitive
to dissolved Al concentrations. Accordingly, if log( IAP)
values calculated for OL15 are not considered due to their
rather low Al concentrations (0.048 and 0.207 mg/L), the
pH-, and SO
4and Al concentration ranges with
quasi-constant log( IAP) values is signiﬁcantly smaller
(pH: 5.2–5.9; SO 4: 94–220 mg/L; Al: 0.53–4.4 mg/L).
The main implication of observing of a quasi-constant
log(IAP) value is that such value actually equalizes the log-
arithm of the basaluminite equilibrium constant (log( K)) at
the given sampling temperature (4–8.5 /C176C). Moreover, it
conﬁrms earlier ﬁndings that the pH-dependentsolubility of basaluminite or other Al-hydroxysulfates exert
a strong control on the dissolved Al concentration (e.g.,
Nordstrom, 1982; Jones et al., 2011 ).
The strong solubility control by basaluminite is further
demonstrated by mixing calculations performed for the ﬁrst
basaluminite occurrence where OL8 is merged with T4 toform OL 9 ( Fig. 1 ). Assuming that SO
4behaves more or
less conservatively in relation to Al yields numerically
determined mixing proportions of 69:31 and 68:32 for thetwo sampling campaigns at this particular conﬂuence point.Table 5 shows that such conservative mixing can well

basaluminite precipitation predicted by PHREEQC are shown for both sampling campaigns.

4Calculated by PHREEQC by forcing the saturation index of basaluminite to 0, whereas the actual basaluminite log( K) was set to the log
(IAP) determined for Sample OL9 during the corresponding sampling campaign ( Table 1 ).264 C. Wanner et al./ Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 238 (2018) 252–269explain the concentrations of the major cation (Mg) and
anion (SO 4), whereas the Al concentration is overestimated
by 10–30%. Since the two Ova Lavirun samples at OL8 andOL9 are physically separated by about 50 m only ( Fig. 1 ),
such Al overestimation demonstrates that basaluminite pre-
cipitation occurs almost instantaneously when the pHincreases to about 5.4 upon mixing with tributary T4. Fastprecipitation is further in agreement with (i) the observation
that after mixing and initial basaluminite precipitation at
OL9 the chemical composition of Ova Lavirun remainsconstant unless it does not merge with the next tributary
(e.g. Sample OL10, Fig. 3 b), (ii) the nanocrystalline occur-
rence of basaluminite ( Fig. 4 b), and (iii) PHREEQC calcu-
lations, which nicely reconstruct the pH value measured at
OL9, when numerically mixing OL8 and T4 and simultane-
ously allowing basaluminite to precipitate ( Table 5 ). The
later was simulated by forcing the basaluminite saturationindex to 0, whereas the actual basaluminite log( K) was set
to the log( IAP) values determined for Sample OL9 during
the corresponding sampling campaigns ( Table 1 ). In con-
trast to pH, Al concentrations predicted by the PHREEQC
mixing calculations do not perfectly match the observed
concentration at OL9 ( Table 5 ) because basaluminite log
(IAP) values are not highly sensitive to dissolved Al concen-
trations as discussed above.
5.2. Temperature dependence of the basaluminite log( K)
To the best of our knowledge, the log( K) value of basa-
luminite has only been determined at 25 /C176C and for an ideal
stoichiometry of Al
4(OH) 10(SO4)/C15H2O, and reported val-
ues range between 22 and 24 ( Singh and Brydon, 1969;
Adams and Rawajﬁh, 1977; Sa ´nchez-Espan ˜a et al., 2011 ).
Interestingly, the log( K) inferred for basaluminite from
Ova Lavirun at T = 4–8.5 /C176C is up to 11 orders of magni-
tude higher (log( K)/C2533). The discrepancy is partially
inherited from considering the inferred (Al 4(OH) 10.43(-
SO4)0.79/C12.2H 2O) instead of the ideal basaluminite stoi-
chiometry (Al 4OH10(SO4)/C15H2O), but this can only
account for a diﬀerence of 3–4 orders of magnitude(Table 1 ). Accordingly, the log( K) of basaluminite seems
to be strongly temperature dependent, which can be
expressed by integration of the Van’t Hoﬀ equation(Sanjuan et al., 2014 )

where K298refers to the equilibrium constant at 25 /C176C,DH
/C176Ris the standard molar enthalpy of reaction (J mol/C01), T is
the temperature given in K, and Rrefers to the ideal gas
constant (8.3143 J K/C01mol/C01). Applying Eq. (3)with the
average temperature observed along the Ova Lavirun sec-tion with visible precipitates (T = 6.8 /C176C), the correspond-
ing average log( IAP) value referring to the ideal
basaluminite stoichiometry (log( K)
T= 29.73, Table 1 ),
and the average basaluminite log( K) reported at 25 /C176C
(log(K)298= 23.58) yields an enthalpy of reaction of
/C0539 kJ/mol.To date, calorimetric investigations on Al-
hydroxysulfates similar to basaluminite were so far only
conducted on alunite (KAl 3(SO4)2(OH) 6,Bohmhammel
et al., 1987 ) and Na(AlO 4)Al12(OH) 24(H2O)12(SO4)4, which
refers to crystalline Al 13sulfate ( Armstrong et al., 2011 ).
Therefore, in any of the PHREEQC databases enthalpiesof reaction of Al-hydroxysulfates similar to basaluminiteare tabulated for alunite only. The values listed in the
WATEQ4F/PHREEQC and LLNL databases are /C0210
and/C0232 kJ mol
/C01, respectively, which is less than half
the value calculated for basaluminite above. Given that alu-
nite does usually not simultaneously form with basaluminite
(Bigham and Nordstrom, 2000 ) and that we could not use
the basaluminite stoichiometry inferred from the chemical
analysis ( Table 4 ) to estimate DH/C176R, however, such
discrepancy seems plausible and hence supports the pro-posed temperature dependence of the basaluminite log( K)
value. Moreover, a strongly negative enthalpy of reaction
is supported by calorimetric investigations of crystalline
Al
13-bearing sulfate (Na(AlO 4)Al12(OH) 24(H2O)12(SO4)4),
yielding an enthalpy of reaction of /C0944.30 ± 5.66 kJ mol/C01
for the dissolution in 5 N HCl at 301 K ( Armstrong et al.,
2011). In any case, additional investigations are required
to quantify the temperature dependence of the basaluminite
log(K) value.
5.3. Factors potentially controlling basaluminite precipitation
Despite the observation that the precipitates from Ova
Lavirun structurally refer to basaluminite, NMRspectroscopy ( Fig. 7 ), the kinetic Ferron method, as well
as geochemical speciation calculations ( Fig. 3 c) provide
multiple evidences for the simultaneous occurrence of minoramounts of Al
13. The coexistence of Al 13and basaluminite
has been inferred previously ( Carrero et al., 2017a ). Due
to the fact that the analyzed precipitates represent time-integrated properties whereas the streamwater samples refer
to one point in time, however, further experimental studies
are required to quantitatively assess whether the formationAl
13and basaluminite are related or if their simultaneous
occurrence is fortuitous only. The same applies for elucidat-
ing why the precipitates from Ova Lavirun refer dominantly
to basaluminite rather than to an aggregation of Al 13such as
postulated for virtually the same setting of acidic stream
neutralization ( Ulrich and Po ¨thig, 2000; Furrer et al.,
2002). Nevertheless, the consistency of our data allows pre-
senting the following hypotheses on the fate of Al 13and its
potential role in controlling basaluminite precipitation.
According to geochemical speciation calculations per-
formed for the Al-H 2O system, at Al concentrations similar
to the one observed along the upper part of Ova Lavirun
(>2.5 mg/L; /C240.1 mmol/L) Al 13becomes a signiﬁcant Al
species at a pH > 4.8 ( Furrer et al., 1992b ). From the syn-
thesis of Al 13-bearing sulfate crystals ( Johansson, 1960,
1963; Armstrong et al., 2011 ), however, it is known that
Al13tends to precipitate in the presence of sulfate anions.
Based on these considerations it is possible that Al 13forms
when Ova Lavirun is for the ﬁrst time neutralized to aC. Wanner et al./ Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 238 (2018) 252–269 265pH > 5 upon mixing with tributary T4 such as suggested
with our geochemical speciation calculations ( Fig. 3 d),
but that signiﬁcant accumulation is limited by sulfate con-centrations >100 mg/L due to immediate precipitation of
Al
13-bearing sulfates. Such interpretation is consistent with
our speciation calculations suggesting that the AlSO 4+com-
plex is an important Al species ( Table 1 ), which can poten-
tially limit the formation of Al 13. Moreover, Allouche and
Taulelle (2003) have shown that the presence of F/C0ions
hinders the formation of Al 13while promoting the one of
Al30instead. Hence, the formation of Al 13may be also lim-
ited due to F concentrations up to 2 mg/L along the section
with visible precipitates, which is consistent with our speci-ation calculations, suggesting that along this section AlF
2+
and AlF2+account for up to 76% of total dissolved Al
(Table 1 ). Finally, our speciation calculations predict lower
Al13contents than the ones obtained when performing the
speciation calculations at the same pH but at 25 /C176C
(Table 1 ). As a consequence, low water temperatures
observed in Ova Lavirun have the potential to limit theaccumulation of Al
13as well.
In the literature it is well accepted that so called pre-
nucleation clusters may form precursors for the precipita-tion of XRD amorphous as well as crystalline phases
(Gebauer et al., 2014 , and references therein). Typical
example include the formation of pre-nucleation calciumcarbonate clusters prior calcium carbonate precipitation
(Gebauer et al., 2008 ), the formation of mono- or di-
nuclear iron-hydroxide species prior to the formation ofamorphous Fe-oxyhydroxides ( Cornell et al., 1989 ), and
the polymerization of silica monomer forming amorphous
silica eventually ( Perry and Keeling-Tucker, 2000 ). In case
of Al
13it has been shown that Al 13can form a precursor
for the precipitation of crystalline Al-hydroxides ( Bottero
et al., 1987; Bradley et al., 1993 ). Due to its rather high
stability, however, Al 13may not fully qualify as a pre-
nucleation cluster ( Gebauer et al., 2014 ). Nevertheless, the
simultaneous occurrence of basaluminite and Al 13in our
samples as well as our speciation calculations suggests thataqueous Al
13and/or Al 13-bearing sulfates may be related to
the subsequent precipitation of basaluminite. Such hypoth-
esis is consistent with the rather large pH range for which
basaluminite precipitation has been described in the litera-ture, and the fact that the formation pH of aqueous Al
13
is negatively correlated to the dissolved total Al concentra-tion ( Furrer et al., 1992b ). For instance, in the studies
where basaluminite was synthesized by titrating acid mine
drainage solutions, precipitation occurred between pH 4.2
and 4.7 at Al concentrations >100 mg/L (i.e., 3 mmol/L)(Sa´nchez-Espan ˜a et al., 2011; Carrero et al., 2015, 2017b ).
In contrast, along Ova Lavirun basaluminite precipitation
occurs at Al concentrations <2 mg/L (<0.075 mmol/L) ata pH > 5.3. Hence, the formation of basaluminite maydepend on the ﬁrst formation of aqueous Al
13during neu-
tralization of Al- and sulfate-rich acidic solutions. Due to
the high amount of transitional polymers observed instreamwater samples collected along the section with visible
precipitates (OL13–OL15, Table 2 ), however, it is also pos-
sible that the precipitation of basaluminite builds on Alpolymers of unknown structure rather than on Al
13.5.4. Basaluminite is a highly eﬃcient sink for As
Despite the low pH and high sulfate concentrations, dis-
solved arsenic concentrations of Ova Lavirun are rather
low. For the September 2015 sampling campaign they were
all below the detection limit of 0.01 mg/L, whereas in July2016 they gradually decreased from 0.115 mg/L at OL4 to0.011 at OL14 ( Table 1 ). The low As concentrations are
due to the fact that pyrite-bearing chlorite mica-schists
exposed at the origin of Ova Lavirun are almost As-free(Ghebremedhin, 2017 ). Similarly, the observation that
other heavy metal concentrations are mildly elevated only
(e.g., Zn, Ni, Mn; Tables S1 and S2, Electronic Annex )i s
due to the limited occurrence of other metal sulﬁdes than
pyrite. Given the low dissolved As concentrations, the ele-
vated As content of the collected basaluminite samples(Table 4 ) is remarkable and conﬁrms the high aﬃnity for
As under ﬁeld-scale conditions ( Carrero et al., 2015,
2017b ). Although we cannot rule out elevated dissolved
As concentrations during speciﬁc discharge events, ouranalyses suggest that with time basaluminite can strongly
concentrate As with respect to the solution from which it
precipitates, and thus has the potential to almost com-pletely remove As in aqueous environments.
The uptake of As by basaluminite has been attributed to
its layered structure where sulfate anions are arranged as aninterlayer connecting positively charged Al-octahedron lay-
ers (Carrero et al., 2017a, 2017b ). These studies thus suggest
that sulfate anions are easily exchangeable and that theaﬃnity for arsenate anions (H
2AsO 4/C0) as well as for selenate
(SeO 42/C0) is high. At our study site, the anion exchange
capacity of basaluminite is not only manifested by elevated
As concentrations but also by the rather high Al/SO 4ratio
of 5.1 ( Table 4 ) and the elevated formation pH
(>5.3, Fig. 3 b), suggesting a positive correlation between
the Al/SO 4ratio and the formation pH. This is because
such correlation is consistent with a substitution reaction
where one sulfate anion is replaced by two hydroxide ions,
which is favored with increasing pH due to the subsequentincrease in hydroxide activity. In contrast, in the studieswhere basaluminite was synthesized by titrating acid mine
drainage solutions, the low Al/SO
4ratio (2.7–4.1) coincides
with a low basaluminite formation pH of 4.2–4.7 ( Totsche
et al., 2003; Sa ´nchez-Espan ˜a et al., 2011; Carrero et al.,
2015, 2017b ), indicating that basaluminite serves as a
strong anion exchanger. However, more research isrequired to investigate whether the mobility of toxic oxyan-
ions other than arsenate and selenate could be reduced in
the presence of basaluminite, in order to further test itsperformance in conjunction with treatment systems for acid
waters.
6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
We have presented an extended geochemical dataset
from a large occurrence of nanocrystalline Al-hydroxysulfates that form naturally in a small alpine catch-
ment in Switzerland when an acidic mountainous stream
(pH/C244) is neutralized by mixing with several neutral
tributaries. The collected data include streamwater analysis,266 C. Wanner et al./ Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 238 (2018) 252–269synchrotron based high-energy X-ray diﬀraction analysis,
nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy, as
well as results from geochemical modeling. The mainconclusions are:
1. Structurally, the investigated Al-hydroxysulfates refer
dominantly to basaluminite rather than to an aggrega-
tion of the e-Keggin polyoxocation [Al
12(AlO 4)
(OH) 24(H2O)12]7+(Al13) such as postulated for virtu-
ally the same setting of acidic stream neutralization
(Furrer et al., 2002 ). Geochemical speciation calcula-
tions suggest that the formation of Al 13is limited by
low temperature (4–8 /C176C) and relatively high concen-
trations of sulfate and ﬂuoride on the order of 100and 1–2 mg/L, respectively.
2. Based on the coexistence of minor amounts of Al
13
with basaluminite in the precipitates, geochemical spe-ciation calculations and the observed basaluminiteformation pH (>5), it is hypothesized that the forma-
tion of basaluminite builds on the initial formation of
the Al
13polymer or on Al polymers of unknown
structure.
3. Basaluminite precipitation occurs instantaneous and
exerts a strong solubility control on dissolved Al concen-trations. Fast precipitation is one of the reasons for thenanocrystalline character of basaluminite.
4. Basaluminite forms a highly eﬃcient sink for As, con-
ﬁrming the reported aﬃnity for arsenate anions(H
2AsO 4-)(Carrero et al., 2017a ). The positive correla-
tion between the formation pH and the Al/SO 4ratio fur-
ther demonstrates that basaluminite operates as aneﬃcient anion exchanger. This suggests that basalu-
minite may reduce the mobility of other toxic oxyanions
as well and emphasizes its important role in conjunctionwith the treatment of acid waters.
