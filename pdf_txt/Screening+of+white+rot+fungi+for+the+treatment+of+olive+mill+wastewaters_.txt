ABSTRACT  
This study was designed to harness the 
environmentally  friendly biological process which 
is economical in the treatment of industrial wastes. 
The study employed the effectiveness in the 
biodegradation and treatment of the olive mill 
wastewater (OMWW) by fu ngi, using standard 
procedures in the enzyme synthesis as well as data 
analysis. The result of the standard calibration 
curve showed that the OMW W have an optimum 
pH value in the range of 3 with phenolic 
degradation to laccase enzyme at 76.12% in 
15minutes , allowing the OMWW to be degraded 
directly without adjustment in pH. It was also 
observed that an increased enzyme activity 
significantly increased the absorbance level with 
the most suitable temperature range found to be 
between 40.5°C to 41.5°C. The stu dy has revealed 
the suitability of using fungi in remediation of 
industrial wastewater.  
Key words: Olive mill wastewater, fungi, phenol, 
laccase, degradation , enzyme . 
 
I. INTRODUCTION  
Olive  oil is  a fat obtained  from  olive   
fruit ( Olea   europaea ),   a   tree crop of  the 
Mediterranean Basin  and commonly  used  in 
cooking , cosmetics, pharmaceuticals ,  and soaps , 
and as a fuel for traditional oil lamps.  Olive oil is 
used throughout the world and is often associated 
with Mediterranean countries especially Greece 
andCyprus. Olive oil consumption has suffered an 
increase in the l ast two decades. The highest 
demand of this natural fat may be related to the use 
of olive oil as the main fat source in the so -called Mediterranean di et that has been proved to pre vent 
the incidence of cardiovascular and 
neurodegenerative diseases in huma ns, and also 
some types of cancer (Tuck and Hayball 2002; 
Boudet 2007; Yang et al. 2007).  
The olive oil processing industry has two 
by-products whether the press system or three -
phase centrifugation is used. The rest is termed 
―pomace" or ―husk". It is the  solids resulting from 
the squeezed residue. The other is a dark red to 
black liquid called olive mill wastewater" (OMW) 
(Adhoum&Monser, 2004; Zenjariet al., 2006).  
OMW is a complex mixture of water (83 -
92%), organic matter (4 -16%), and minerals (1 -
2%). Th e organic matter includes sugars (1 -8%), 
nitrogenous compounds (0.5 -2.4%), fatty acids 
(0.5-1.5%), polyalcohols, polyphenols and pectins 
(1.0-1.5%), and fats (0.02 -1%). These wastewaters 
present high organic loads, usually indicated as 
chemical oxygen dema nd (COD), up to 100 -200 
gO2/L (Asses et al. 2000), and low biodegradability 
assessed by the ratio between COD and 
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) which varies 
from 2.05 to 2.35 (Vlyssideset al. 2004).  Sugars 
(18%), N -compounds (0.52.4%), organic acids 
(0.51.5%), fats (0.021%), phenols and pectins 
(11.5%) are organic fractions of olive mill wastes 
(Hana fi, Assobhei, &Mountadar, 2010). As they 
have high phenol, lipid and organic acid 
concentrations, they are phytotoxic materials and 
cause serious environmenta l concerns that are also 
related to treatment costs. However, these wastes 
also contain valuable resources such as a large 
proportion of organic matter and a wide range

ofnutrients that could be recycled (Hachicha et al., 
2009c; Azbar et al., 2004).

ause,inplants,leafandfruitabscission and inhibition 
of seed germination if it’s being disposed 
uncontrollably. Discharging into water bodies 
increase the phosphorous content, causing color 
alteration and bad smell While dis posing olive 
wastes in open space causes microbial 
fermentation, with the production of methane and a 
wide array of harmf ul or simply bad smelling 
gases.  
For these reasons, the development of 
suitable OMW treatments has been a challenge for 
the researchers. However, until now none of the 
proposed treatments can be pointed out, both as 
economically feasible and effective, for treating 
this type of wastewaters. Proposed treatments 
include physical, chemical and biological 
operations, isolated or co mbined in several ways 
(Azbaret al. 2004; Niaounakis and Halvadakis 
2006; Arvanitoyannis et al.2007). Chemical and 
physical processes to treat OMW fail to be 
widespread because they are costly, with low 
efficiencies, and present serious sludge disposal 
problems (Mantzavinos and Kalogerakis 2005). 
Biological processes gained popu larity due to their 
environmental compatibility, lower management 
costs and equivalent efficiencies compared to 
physical -chemical ones. Usually, biological 
methods for OMW treatment include aerobic -
activated sludge, co - digestion and anaerobic 
digestion (Tziotzioset al. 2007; McNamara et 
al.2008).  
 
II. TREATMENT METHODS OF 
OLIVE OILWASTEWATER  
2.1 PhysicalMethods  
In practical terms, the most common 
treatment method is through evaporation i n storage 
ponds in the open because of the low investment 
required and the favorable climatic conditions in 
Mediterranean countries. The large area needed, 
bad odor, infiltration and insect proliferation are 
negative properties of evaporation (Roiget al., 
2006).  
Another alternative OMW treatment is 
vacuum evaporation producing distillate and 
concentrate. Distillate is produced continuously, 
and a discontinuous concentrate automatically 
discharged. Sodium hydroxide was used to 
neutralize wastewater during distillat ion in a study 
that was carried out by Azbaret al. (2004). As a 
result, the distilled water volume reached 90% of 
the wastewater input. Although the distil -late is a 
color -less liquid, its COD is 3000 -4000 mg/ L showing that further treatment is still requi red. 
Biological oxidation of the distillate pre -ceded by 
pH adjustment and C: N: P correction gave a 
treated water complying with the waste water 
discharge regulations. The concentrate and the 
olive mill solid residues can be mixed. This 
mixture can either  be de -oiled and burned or used 
for various purposes such as animal fodder or 
fertilizer, as it contains 14% protein and 5% 
potassium (Azbaret al.,2004).  
 
2.2 ChemicalMethods  
Sterilization of OMW prior to the 
incubation with the isolates to be tested is 
performed and has been reported by several 
authors, justifying this previous step as a mea - sure 
to ensure that the alterations suffered by the sample 
are only due to the inoculums, and not to other 
microorganisms present in the OMW. (Sayadi and 
Ellouz 1995;  Vinciguerraet al. 1995; D’Annibale et 
al. 1998; Ben Hamman et al. 1999; Asses et al. 
2000; García -García et al. 2000; Tsioul - pas et al. 
2002; Aggeliset al. 2003; D’Annibale et al. 2004; 
Kachouriet al. 200 6; Aissamet al. 2007; Martinez -
García et al. 2009;  Asses et al. 200 0). Nevertheless , 
it has been pointed out that the results obtained 
with sterilized samples should be cautious, since 
the heating process may lead to physicochemical 
alterations on some compounds. COD values may 
de- crease, and oxidation of phenolics and quinoids 
may cause  precipitation and darkening of the water 
(Fontoulakiset al. 2002; Aggeliset al. 2003; 
Kachouriet al.2005).  
In reports using sterilized samples OMW 
were tested atseveral dilutions and with different 
supplements. The addition of supplements is 
performed to prevent lack of essential nutrients as 
nitrogen and phosphorus, which should bein 
agreement with high C/N ratios for an efficient 
microbialgrowth (Fadilet al. 2003).  
 
2.3 Physicoc hemical Methods  
The most important inorganic occupants  
that have been used for  OMW treatment are ferric 
and ferrous chloride, ferric sulphate, and aluminum  
sulphate. In addition, aluminum chloride, calcium 
hydroxide, and their combinations added as anionic 
polyelectrolytes, also sulphuric acid, were tested by 
several researchers. No ne of these reagents should 
be used if the precipitated material is to be used as 
animal feed (Azbaret al., 2004; Tsagarakiet al., 
2007). In one study, calcium hydroxide and 
alumin ium sulphate were used to reduce COD to 
20 30% of initial values (Roiget al. , 2006).  
One of the major disadvantages is that 
they are only a partial solution and must be

followed by a secondary treatment to comply with 
legal requirements because the treated liquid still 
has a high polluting load. Thus, they are more 
suitable as pre-treatment methods. The other one is 
the large quantities of sludge that cause other 
environmental problems (Panizza &Cerisola, 2006; 
Tsagaraki, Lazarides, &Petrotos, 2007 ). 
 
2.4 BiologicalMethods  
Biological treatments are also generally used for 
the treatment of OMW.  
 
Aerobic treatments:  
Anoth er way to manage OMW is by 
aerobic treatment with micro -organisms, which has 
also been  used to remove the pollution eff ect of 
OMW (Anas tasiou, Christou, Michael, Nico laides, 
&Lambrou, 2011). Aerobic bacteria have been 
tested primarily to remove phytotoxic com -pounds 
(i.e., monoaromatic or simple phenolics) from 
OMW, although some studies have also focused  on 
reduction of COD. The bacte ria ap -pear to have a 
minimal eff ect on mor e complex polyphenolics 
responsible for the dark coloration of OMW. 
Furthe rmore, they appear to be very eff ective 
against some phenol ic compounds and relatively 
ineffective against others. For exam ple, Bacillus 
pumilus  was able to completely de grade 
protoc atechuic acid and ca eic acid but had much 
less eff ect on tyrosol. On the other hand, 
Arthrobacter transformed tyrosol to 4 -
hydroxyphenyl acetic acid.  The production of energy (biogas) and the 
potential re -use of the effluent in irrigation are the 
main reaso ns to use anaerobic digestion for OMW 
treatment. The major limitation of this treatment is 
the inhibition of methanogenic bacteria by the 
phenolic compounds and the organic acids present 
in the OMW. Anaerobic digesters or anaerobic 
sludge bed reactors are suitable for treating OMW 
but a pre -treatment stage is necessary to remove 
undesirable compounds. It was proposed that 
sedimentation infiltration pre -treatment prior to 
anaerobic digestion is a useful way of OMW 
disposal (Roiget al.,2006).

V. CONCLUSIONS  
The by -products obtained during olive oil 
production exhibits high levels of phenolic 
compounds such as hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein 
that are hazardous to the environment due to the 
non-degradable nature of phenols and can be 
considered highly toxic hence ; the methods for 
phenol removal cannot be over emphasized.  
Nevertheless, the use of safer and eco -friendly 
methods such as the use of laccase producing fungi 
to degrade OMW must be considered in a pilot 
scale due to their great potential for olive mill 
waste degradation. Additionally, this method is 
time and cost effective as the raw materials used 
are agricultural wastes, not expensive and easy 
toobtain.  
The mesophilic white -rot fungi 
(Trametesvesicolor ) secreted an extracellular 
ligninolytic enzyme call ed laccase known for its 
degradation of phenols and decolorization of OMW 
than any other biological method.
