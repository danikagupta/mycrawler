ABSTRACT:Esteri/uniFB01cation of kraft lignin inherently addresses its potential for thermoplastic applications either on its own or asa component of polymer blends. In this e/uniFB00ort, we have investigated the selectivity of softwood kraft lignin toward esteri/uniFB01cationvia acylation. LignoBoost kraft lignin was esteri/uniFB01ed with acetyl (C2), octanoyl (C8), lauroyl (C12), and palmitoyl (C16) chloridesat various molar ratios with respect to the total hydroxyls present. Quantitative31P NMR spectroscopy, Fourier transforminfrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) were used to evaluate the selectivity and e/uniFB03ciency ofthese reactions on the various hydroxyl groups present. The C8−C16acyl chlorides showed distinct enhanced reactivity towardthe aliphatic hydroxyl groups, whereas C2acyl chloride was found to react uniformly with any available OH irrespective of theirchemical nature. The e/uniFB00ects of long chain acylation on the polymer and material properties were also examined using solutionviscosity, thermal, and rheological measurements. Polymer blends were also produced and studied by melt extrusion. The longaliphatic chains when installed on the lignin displayed peculiar association e/uniFB00ects in solution and enhanced the melt/uniFB02owcharacteristics of the lignin−polymer blends.KEYWORDS:Softwood kraft lignin, Fatty acid esteri/uniFB01cation, Methylation, Characterization, Quantitative31P NMR,Thermal and rheological properties, Polymer blends■INTRODUCTIONLignin is an amorphous polyphenol found in plant cell walls.Native lignin has a random, three-dimensional structure createdvia an enzyme-mediated dehydrogenative polymerization ofphenyl propanoic precursors such as coniferyl, sinapyl andp-coumaryl alcohols.1Softwood trees contain about 28 mass % oflignin composed of over 95% 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy (guaiacyl)and traces ofp-hydroxyphenyl units.2The main linkages between the phenylpropane units insoftwood lignin (about 45% of all C9-structures) are aryl-alkylethers, orβ-0-4′bonds.3During the industrial kraft pulpingprocess, which is aimed at delignifying wood for celluloseproduction, most of theβ-0-4′linkages are cleaved to yield largeamounts of small phenolic compounds.4Under kraft processconditions, this material forms highly condensed structureswith enol ether and stilbene linkages as well as various types ofcarbon−carbon linkages. Furthermore, these so-called“kraftlignins”(spent liquor lignins, or black liquor lignins) possessvarious aliphatic hydroxyls, methoxyls, catechols, some carboxylgroups and sulfur bridges.5,6Marton, in 1971, proposed a tentativestructure for softwood kraft lignin (Scheme S1) admittedly in needof serious revision.7In the United States, the kraft pulping processes account formore than 85% of wood pulp production with 56 million tons ofpulp produced in 2006.8However, most of the available lignin isnot isolated, but provides a major source of energy for pulp mills.Only about 1 million tons per year (2%) is actually commercialized.9Special Issue:Lignin Re/uniFB01ning, Functionalization, and UtilizationReceived:May 14, 2016Revised:July 22, 2016Published:August 10, 2016Research Articlepubs.acs.org/journal/ascecg
