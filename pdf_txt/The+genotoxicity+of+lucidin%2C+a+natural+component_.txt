C.  RUBIA TINCTORUM , MORINDA OFFICINALIS
AND ANTHRAQUINONES
1.  Exposure Data
1.1 Origin, type and botanical data
1.1.1 Rubia tinctorum L.(Rubiaceae )
The medicinal part of Rubia tinctorum is the dried root (Blumenthal et al. , 1998)
(common names: madder, dyer’s madder (Felter & Lloyd, 2002)). The small yellowish-green flowers are in loose, leafy, long-peduncled terminal or axillary cymes. The marginof the calyx is indistinct, 4- to 5-sectioned and has a tip that is curved inward. There arefive stamens and an inferior ovary. The fruit is a black, pea-sized glabrous, smooth drupecontaining two seeds. The perennial plant grows to a height of 60 to 100 cm. The pencil-thick rhizome creeps widely underground. The stem is quadrangular with backward-turning prickles at the edges. The stems are at times so thin that they are more descendentthan erect. The leaves are in whorls, in fours below, in sixes above. They are oblong tolanceolate with one rib and protrudingly reticulate beneath. The plant is indigenous tosouthern Europe, western Asia and North Africa, and is cultivated elsewhere (MedicalEconomics Co., 2000).
1.1.2 Morinda officinalis How (Rubiaceae ) (Figure 1)
The medicinal root of M. officinalis is cylinder-shaped (with oblate circumference of
the section) and slightly curved. The diameter of the root is usually 0.5–2 cm. Thesurface, with vertical wrinkles and transverse crackles, is yellowish-gray or dark gray. Insome roots, the bark is thicker, violet or light violet in colour, and easy to separate fromthe xylem. The xylem, with a diameter of 1–5 mm and with slightly dentate margin, ishard and yellowish-brown or whitish-yellow in colour. Morinda root is odourless, sweetand slightly sour in taste. The fleshy root is used for medicinal purposes.
–129–1.2 Use
The roots of R. tinctorum contain a red colouring matter which is used for dyeing.
Additionally, extracts from R. tinctorum are used for the treatment of kidney and bladder
stones (Westendorf et al., 1990; Blömeke et al., 1992). Plants containing 1-hydroxy-
anthraquinone have been widely used for pharmaceutical purposes such as treatment ofkidney and bladder stones, as a laxative mixture, and as a mild sedative (Brown &Brown, 1976; Mori et al., 1990; Wang et al., 1992). Madder root has reportedly also been
used medicinally for menstrual and urinary disorders (Medical Economics Co., 1998,2000). The roots of M. officinalis have been used as a Chinese natural medicine for tonic
and analgesic purposes.
Anthraquinone glycosides are the active principles of plant-derived laxatives such as
senna, cascara, frangula, rhubarb and aloe. These five plant-derived laxative substancesare not included in the present review, because there are no published reports on theirIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 130

®, but human drug products containing Dantron®(see IARC, 1990) were with-
drawn from commerce in the United States in 1987 after it was shown to cause intestinaltumours in experimental animals.
1.3 Chemical constituents
Anthracene derivatives are widely distributed in the plant kingdom. Especially in the
dicotyledons, many families, such as the Hypericaceae ( Hypericum ), Polygonaceae
(Rheum , Rumex , Polygonum ), Rhamnaceae ( Rhamnus ) and Rubiaceae ( Rubia , Morinda ,
Galium ), are rich in anthracene derivatives. In the monocotyledons, only the family
Liliaceae ( Aloe) contains this class of chemicals. About 90% of these compounds occur
as derivatives of 9,10-anthracenedione (anthraquinones) with several hydroxy and otherfunctional groups, such as methyl, hydroxymethyl and carboxy groups. Hydroxyanthra-quinones are the active principles of many phytotherapeutic drugs. 
1.3.1 Rubia tinctorum
Compounds found in Rubia tinctorum include purpurin (oxyalizarin; 1,2,4-tri-
hydroxyanthraquinone), mollugin (6-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-2 H-naphtho[1,2- b]pyran-5-
carboxylic acid, methyl ester), 1-hydroxy-2-methylanthraquinone, 2-ethoxymethyl-anthraquinone, rubiadin (1,3-dihydroxy-2-methylanthraquinone), 1,3-dihydroxyanthra-quinone, 7-hydroxy-2-methylanthraquinone, lucidin (1,3-dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl-anthraquinone), 1-methoxymethylanthraquinone, 2,6-dihydroxyanthraquinone, lucidin-3-O-primeveroside [6-( β-
D-xylosido)- D-glucoside], alizarin (1,2-dihydroxyanthra-
quinone), lucidin- O-ethyl ether, 1-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethylanthraquinone 3-glucoside,
2-hydroxymethylanthraquinone 3-glucoside, 3,8-dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethylanthra-quinone 3-glucoside, ruberythric acid (alizarin primeveroside; alizarin glycoside), quini-zarin and iridoid asperuloside (Schneider et al., 1979; Kawasaki et al., 1992; Derksen
et al., 1998; El-Emary & Backheet, 1998; Marczylo et al., 2000).
A number of compounds have been characterized from the roots of R. tinctorum (the
source of commercial madder colour) by various analytical methods. Among these com-pounds are alizarin, ruberythric acid, purpurin, lucidin, rubiadin, mollugin, 1-hydroxy-2-methylanthraquinone, tectoquinone (2-methylanthraquinone), nordamnacanthal (1,3-di-hydroxy-2-anthraquinonecarboxaldehyde), 1-hydroxy-2-methoxyanthraquinone, 1,3-di-hydroxy-2-ethoxymethylanthraquinone, scopoletin (7-hydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin)and the glucosides and/or the primeverosides of these compounds (Kawasaki et al .,
1992; Westendorf et al ., 1998; Medical Economics Co., 2000). The majority of the
anthraquinones present in the plant itself or in plant extracts are glycosides (Blömekeet al., 1992; Westendorf et al., 1998).SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 1311.3.2 Morinda officinalis 
A number of compounds have been isolated from M. officinalis . Anthraquinones
found in the plant include 1,6-dihydroxy-2,4-dimethoxyanthraquinone, 1,6-dihydroxy-2-methoxyanthraquinone, methylisoalizarin, methylisoalizarin-1-methyl ether, 1-hydroxy-2-methoxyanthraquinone, 1-hydroxy-2-methylanthraquinone, physcion, 1-hydroxy-anthraquinone, 2-methylanthraquinone, 2-hydroxy-3-hydroxymethylanthraquinone,rubiadin and rubiadin-1-methyl ether. Terpenoids found include asperuloside tetra-acetate, monotropein, morindolide and morofficinaloside. Glucosides found includenystose, 1F-fructofuranosylnystose, inulin-type hexasaccharide and heptasaccharide.β-Sitosterol, 24-ethylcholesterol, a ketone (officinalisin) and several amino acids have
also been found (Li et al. , 1991; Yang et al., 1992; Yoshikawa et al., 1995; Zheng &
Dong, 1997; Yao et al., 1998).

1.5.4 Analysis 
A method using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
has been described that allows the separation of 13 naturally occurring naphthoquinonesand anthraquinones, including 1-hydroxyanthraquinone. The separation was achievedunder isocratic and gradient conditions (Steinert et al., 1996).
The following method has been used to determine hydroxyanthraquinones in experi-
mental laboratory animal diet containing madder. Hydroxyanthraquinones were isolatedSOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 133

OHby Soxhlet extraction with ethyl acetate, evaporation of the solvent, and dissolution in
methanol. Separation of the hydroxyanthraquinones was accomplished by HPLC withspectrometric detection at 410 nm (Westendorf et al., 1998).
Lucidin content in R. tinctorum crude drug powder has been determined using
reversed-phase HPLC with methanol/acetic acid as the mobile phase and detection at225 nm (Wang et al., 1997).
An HPLC method with isocratic elution has been developed for the separation of
anthraquinones with particular attention to the detection of lucidin in commerciallyavailable sources of R. tinctorum aglycones (Bosáková et al., 2000).
A reversed-phase HPLC method has been developed for the simultaneous character-
ization of anthraquinone glycosides and aglycones in extracts of R. tinctorum . The
anthraquinones, including lucidin, are separated on a reversed-phase column with awater–acetonitrile gradient as eluent and measured with ultraviolet detection at 250 nm(Krizsan et al., 1996; Derksen et al., 1998).
1.5.5 Production
1-Hydroxyanthraquinone has been synthesized by diazotization of 1-aminoanthra-
quinone and heating the diazonium salt with concentrated sulfuric acid. After dilutionwith water, the precipitated crude product was diluted with acetone and purified by pre-parative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) in toluene:ethyl formate:formic acid (75:24:1)(Blömeke et al., 1992).
A general method for synthesis of anthraquinones, including 1-hydroxy-anthraqui-
none, has been developed. The anthraquinones were obtained under mild conditions fromortho -dicarboxylic acid chlorides and suitable aromatic substrates via a Friedel–Crafts
process (Sartori et al., 1990).
1-Hydroxyanthraquinone has also been prepared in 96.4% yield by reacting 1-nitro-
anthraquinone with sodium formate in dimethylformamide at 130 °C for 17 hours(Michalowicz, 1981).
Lucidin has been synthesized from nordamnacanthal (Prista et al. , 1965).
Available information indicates that 1-hydroxyanthraquinone is manufactured by one
company each in China and Japan (Chemical Information Services, 2001).
1.5.6 Use
Anthraquinones are the largest group of naturally occurring quinones. Both natural
and synthetic anthraquinones have been widely used as colourants in food, drugs,cosmetics, hair dyes and textiles (Brown & Brown, 1976; Mori et al., 1990). 1-Hydroxy-
anthraquinone can be used as an intermediate in the production of dyes and drugs (Imaki& Fukumoto, 1988). The Working Group was not aware of any commercial use ofpurified lucidin.IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 1341.5.7 Occurrence
1-Hydroxyanthraquinone has been isolated from the roots of Rubia cordifolia ,
Morinda officinalis andDamnacanthus indicus , from the heartwood of Tabebuia avella-
nedae and the herb Cassia occidentalis (Brown & Brown, 1976; Mori et al., 1990; Wang
et al. , 1992; Yang et al. , 1992; Steinert et al., 1996; Buckingham, 2001). 1-Hydroxy-
anthraquinone has also been identified as a metabolite of alizarin primeveroside, foundin Rubia tinctorum , when alizarin primeveroside was given orally to rats (Blömeke et al.,
1992). 
Lucidin has been identified in plants from Rubia (R. tinctorum, R. iberica ), Copros-
ma (C. lucida, C. rotundifolia, C. acerosa) , Morinda (M. citrifolia, M. umbellata) ,
Galium (G . fagetorum, G . mollugo, G . dasypodum ), Hymenodictyon (H. excelsum ) and
Commitheca (C. liebrechtsiana ) species (Prista et al ., 1965; Burnett & Thomson,
1968a,b; Zhural’ov & Borisov, 1970; Thomson & Brew, 1971; Murti et al ., 1972;
Leistner, 1975; Briggs et al., 1976; Hocquemiller et al., 1976; Bauch & Leistner, 1978;
Inoue et al., 1981; Zhural’ov et al., 1987; Buckingham, 2001).
1.5.8 Human exposure
Thousands of patients in European countries have been treated chronically in the
past, against kidney stones, with madder root preparations ( R. tinctorum ) at high doses.
The daily amount of lucidin ingested by these patients was calculated to be 3–10 mg.Under certain circumstances, the daily lucidin intake may even reach several hundredmilligrams (Westendorf et al., 1998).
2.  Studies of Cancer in Humans
Laxatives based on naturally occurring anthraquinone derivatives
Herbs containing anthraquinone derivatives (rhubarb, senna, frangula, cascara, aloe)
are used as laxatives. A meta-analysis of 11 studies dealing with colorectal cancers andlaxative use showed that use of laxatives carried an increased risk (odds ratio, 1.5;95% CI, 1.3–1.6) for colorectal cancer (Sonnenberg & Müller, 1993). A more recent andvery large study among nurses in the USA found no association between colorectalcancer and laxative use (Dukas et al. , 2000). The relevance of this evidence to the carci-
nogenicity of anthraquinone-containing herbs used as laxatives is unknown because it isuncertain whether the use of laxatives in general is an adequate proxy measure for theuse of anthraquinones. 
The following studies mentioned anthraquinones specifically in evaluating laxative
use as a risk factor for cancer. Also reported below are studies that used melanosis colias a marker of exposure, because this in turn may reflect consumption of anthraquinones(see Section 4.2).SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 1352.1 Case–control studies
2.1.1 Gastrointestinal cancer
Boyd and Doll (1954) analysed data collected in a previous inquiry, which detailed
histories of purgative use for 2249 patients. People whose history of taking purgativesextended over a continuous period of at least five years were considered as ‘purgativeusers’. After excluding patients suffering from gastrointestinal diseases other than cancer,there remained 614 patients with gastrointestinal cancers (387 cancers of the large boweland 227 cancers of the stomach) and 1313 control patients (647 cancers of the lung and666 patients with non-cancer non-gastrointestinal diseases). A history of regular (at leastonce per week) use of purgatives was reported for 222/614 [36.2%] of the patients withgastrointestinal cancer and 343/1313 [26.1%] of the control patients. Use of cascara wasreported by [6%] of cases and [5.4%] of controls. Use of senna was reported by [6.2%]of cases and [2.6%] of controls and when exposure was restricted to chronic users (regu-larly, at least once per week), the percentages were [5.2%] of cases and [1.7%] of con-trols ( p= 0.04). The difference between cases and controls was similar for separate consi-
deration of cancer of the large bowel.
Siegers et al. (1993) studied retrospectively 3049 patients and prospectively 1095
patients who underwent endoscopic examinations in Lübeck, Germany. In the retros-pective study, melanosis coli was found in 3.1% of patients without other abnormalities,in [2.8%] of patients with colitis or diverticulosis, in 8.6% of patients with adenomas andin 3.9% of patients with carcinomas. In the prospective study, melanosis coli was foundin 6.9% in patients without other abnormalities, in [4.5%] in patients with colitis or diver-ticulosis, in 9.8% of patients with adenomas and in 18.6% of patients with carcinomas.The relative risk for colorectal cancer among subjects with melanosis coli was 3.0(95% CI, 1.2–4.9). Among 33 of the patients who had both melanosis coli and adenomaor carcinoma, all but two acknowledged abuse of anthranoid laxatives for 10–30 years.[The Working Group noted that detection of melanosis coli requires colonoscopy and thatindication of colonoscopy may result in selection bias of the controls.]
Kune (1993) analysed laxative use in 685 colorectal cancer patients in Australia,
diagnosed over a 12-month period (1980–81), compared with 723 age- and sex-matchedcommunity-based controls. Use of laxatives containing anthraquinones was reported by[13.9%] of the cases of colorectal cancers and [14.1%] of controls. Comparing cases andcontrols using laxatives containing anthraquinones with patients and controls using nolaxatives, the relative risk for colorectal cancer related to the use of laxatives containinganthraquinones was 1.01 [confidence intervals were not reported].
In a retrospective analysis of 2229 consecutive patients having undergone a colonos-
copy in Erlangen, Germany, between 1985 and 1992, the presence of colorectal cancerwas not associated with melanosis coli or laxative use: colorectal cancer was present in2.7% ( n= 60) of all patients, 2.9 % ( n= 3) of the 102 patients with melanosis coli (rela-
tive risk, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.35–3.4) and in 3.1% ( n= 9) of the 286 patients with anthranoid
laxative use (relative risk, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.48–2.3) (Nusko et al., 1997). [The WorkingIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 136Group noted some discrepancies with data from the same study reported by Nusko et al.
(1993).]
Nusko et al. (2000) performed a prospective case–control study in Erlangen of the
association between anthranoid laxative use and risk for development of colorectal ade-nomas or carcinomas. The study included a total of 202 patients with newly diagnosedcolorectal carcinomas, 114 patients with adenomatous polyps and 238 patients (controls)with no colorectal neoplasms who had been referred for total colonoscopy between 1993and 1996. For each subject, the use of anthranoid preparations was assessed by standar-dized non-blind interview after colonoscopy, and melanosis coli was studied by histo-pathological examination. Use of anthranoid laxatives was reported by 33/238 controls,16/114 adenoma patients and 29/202 carcinoma patients. Anthranoid use did not conferany significantly elevated risk for development of colorectal adenomas (unadjusted oddsratio, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.5–1.9) or carcinomas (unadjusted odds radio, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.6–1.8).After adjustment for the risk factors age, sex and blood in the stools by logisticregression analysis, the odds ratio for adenomas was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.4–1.7) and that forcarcinomas was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.5–1.7). Duration of anthranoid laxative use, whenincluded in the logistic regression as a continuous variable, was not significantly asso-ciated with colorectal carcinoma ( p= 0.41). Macroscopic and high-grade microscopic
melanosis coli were not significantly associated with the development of adenomas orcarcinomas.
2.1.2 Urothelial cancer
Bronder et al. (1999) reported on 766 cases of urothelial cancers (98% confirmed by
histology) in Berlin, Germany, between 1990 and 1994. A control group (1:1) wasobtained by sampling, from the West Berlin Population Registry, persons of Germannationality who had lived in Germany for at least 20 years and matched with the patientsfor sex and age. Through a standardized questionnaire completed by 648 patients and647 controls, social class was recorded as well as consumption of analgesics, laxativesand tobacco. After adjustment for tobacco use and social class, the risk of urothelialcarcinoma was increased in laxative users. Use of contact laxatives was reported by 63urothelial cancer patients versus 29 controls (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5–4.2) and 13renal pelvis and ureter cancer patients versus two controls (odds ratio, 9.3; 95% CI,1.1–83.3). For different laxatives, the corresponding figures (urothelial cancer patientsversus controls) were: chemical and anthranoid laxatives, five versus two (odds ratio,2.7; 95% CI, 0.47–16); anthranoid laxatives alone, 37 versus 20 (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% CI,1.1–3.7); aloe, 16 versus 11 (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.66–3.7); senna, 26 versus 13(odds ratio, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1–5.0); and rhubarb, eight versus four (odds ratio, 2.6;95% CI, 0.68–9.6). [The Working Group noted that no results for laxatives adjusted foruse of analgesics were presented.]SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 1373.  Studies of Cancer in Experimental Animals
3.1 1-Hydroxyanthraquinone
3.1.1 Oral administration
Rat: A group of 30 male ACI/N rats, 1.5 months of age, was fed 1% 1-hydroxyanthra-
quinone in CE-2 diet throughout the experimental period of 480 days. Thirty control ratswere fed basal diet. Rats that survived more than 280 days developed various tumours ofthe intestine (25/29). These comprised caecal adenomas (10/29) or adenocarcinomas(5/29) and colonic adenomas (12/29) or adenocarcinomas (11/29). No such tumours werediagnosed in control rats. In addition, neoplastic nodules and hepatocellular adenomas(12/29) and forestomach papillomas and glandular stomach adenomas (5/29) wereobserved. No such tumours were observed in control animals (Mori et al., 1990).
A group of 27 male ACI/N rats, six weeks of age, was fed 1.5% 1-hydroxyanthra-
quinone in the diet for 48 weeks. A second group (14 rats) was also given 16 mg/L indo-methacin in the drinking-water for the experimental period. Fifteen control rats were fedbasal diet. Rats fed with 1-hydroxyanthraquinone had incidences of 12/27 large intestinalneoplasms (adenomas and adenocarcinomas) and 14/27 forestomach tumours (papillo-mas). In rats fed 1-hydroxyanthraquinone and treated with indomethacin, these inci-dences were 0/14 and 2/14, respectively. Untreated animals and rats given indomethacinalone had no neoplasms in the large intestine and forestomach (Tanaka et al., 1991).
3.1.2 Administration with known carcinogens
Rat: Two groups of male and female ACI/N rats, six weeks of age, were given weekly
intraperitoneal injections of 25 mg/kg bw methylazoxymethanol acetate for two weeks.One group (21 males and 20 females) was subsequently fed 1% 1-hydroxyanthraquinoneuntil the end of the experiment (44 weeks). The second group treated with methylazoxy-methanol acetate (19 males and 19 females) was fed basal diet. A third group (17 malesand 20 females) received 1-hydroxyanthraquinone alone and a control group (16 malesand 22 females) was fed basal diet only. The incidences of caecal tumours (males, 15/17;females, 11/15) and colon tumours (males, 17/17; females, 14/15) in the group treatedwith methylazoxymethanol acetate and 1-hydroxyanthraquinone were significantlyhigher ( p< 0.05) than those of the groups treated with methylazoxymethanol acetate
alone (caecal tumours: males, 0/19; females, 3/15; colon tumours: males, 8/15; females,11/15) or 1-hydroxyanthraquinone alone (caecal tumours: males, 1/17; females, 0/17;colon tumours: males, 0/17; females, 1/17). The incidence and multiplicity of caecumand colon tumours in the first group were significantly greater than the combined resultsIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 138for those of second and third groups, suggesting that 1-hydroxyanthraquinone acted
synergistically with methylazoxymethanol acetate (Mori et al. , 1991).
3.2 1,3-Dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethylanthraquinone (lucidin)
No data on the carcinogenicity of lucidin in rodents were available to the Working
Group, but this compound is an active principle of Rubia tinctorum used as a herbal
medicine. 
Rat: Groups of 15–20 male and female ACI rats, weighing 150–200 g, were fed a
standard diet containing 0, 1 or 10% madder root ( Rubia tinctorum ) for 780 days. This
root contained lucidin (0.34%) but also large amounts of alizarin (0.67%; 1,2-dihydroxy-anthraquinone) and the primeverosides of both compounds. All surviving animals werekilled and necropsied at 780 days. In the groups receiving 10% madder root diet, 2/16males and 3/17 females developed hepatocellular adenomas, whereas none wereobserved in the controls or the 1% madder root group of either sex. In addition, renaltubule-cell adenomas were observed in 1/16 males and 2/16 females in the 10% madderroot group and a renal tubule-cell carcinoma in 1/14 males in the 1% madder root group.No renal tumours were seen in the control groups (Westendorf et al. , 1998). [The
Working Group noted the small number of animals used in this study and that the madderroot contained large amounts of other compounds such as alizarin.]
4.  Other Data Relevant to an Evaluation of
Carcinogenicity and its Mechanisms
4.1 Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion
1-Hydroxyanthraquinone
(a)Humans
No data were available to the Working Group.
(b)Experimental systems
In an early study, 1-hydroxyanthraquinone was found to be absorbed when conti-
nuously administered to rats [strain not specified] by stomach tube (50 mg suspended inaqueous gum arabic), and its metabolites were identified by paper chromatography.Urine and faeces were collected during 48 h after treatment and extracted with diethylether. Of the 1-hydroxyanthraquinone originally present, 2.49% and 0.74% were con-verted into alizarin (1,2-dihydroxyanthraquinone), in urine and faeces, respectively. Thealizarin was then excreted after sulfation and glucuronidation (Fujita et al. , 1961). SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 1391,3-Dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethylanthraquinone (lucidin)
(a)Humans
No data were available to the Working Group.
(b)Experimental systems
No direct information was found on the absorption, distribution, metabolism or
excretion of ludicin in experimental animal systems. However, a report has appeared onthe oral administration of lucidin 3- O-primeveroside to rats, which resulted in the
excretion in the urine of lucidin and (to a lesser extent) rubiadin (1,3-dihydroxy-2-methylanthraquinone) (Blömeke et al. , 1992). 
4.2 Toxic effects
Chronic ingestion of laxatives of the anthracene group such as cascara, senna, fran-
gula, aloe or rhubarb is considered to be an etiological factor in melanosis coli, a condi-tion in which colonic macrophages accumulate a dark pigment with the staining charac-teristics of lipofuscin. In 14 patients submitted to repeated proctoscopies, Speare (1951)produced melanosis 11 times by prescribing cascara sagrada for 4–14 months and elimi-nated it nine times by withdrawing the laxative for 5–11 months. Steer and Colin-Jones(1975) studied histological patterns of rectal biopsies from seven patients with melanosiscoli three months after they ceased to take anthraquinone-containing purgatives. Adecrease was observed in the number of macrophages infiltrating the mucosa, as well asa reduction in the intensity of the acid phosphatase reaction. 
The effect of anthraquinone glycosides on cell proliferation in the sigmoid colon of
patients in vivo has been studied. Twenty-four hours before colonoscopy with a sigmoid
biopsy, nine patients were given an oral dose of 1 mL/kg of a syrup containing2.0 mg/mL of the anthraquinone glycosides sennosides A and B. Proliferative activity ofepithelial cells was determined by incubating the biopsy specimens with the thymidineanalogue 5-bromo-2 ′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and then visualizing BrdU-labelled cells
immunochemically. Proliferative activity was expressed as the labelling index, i.e. thenumber of labelled nuclei divided by the total number of nuclei multiplied by 100 (%).Data from these nine subjects were compared with those of 10 subjects who had a normalcolonoscopy and 14 patients with sporadic colonic neoplasms who had not receivedanthraquinone laxatives before the colonoscopy. The labelling index (% ±SD) was
significantly higher in the group given the sennosides (26.4 ±6.1) than in normal patients
(5.7±1.8) or in patients with a colonic neoplasm (8.7 ±2.6; p< 0.005). Furthermore, the
reduction of the number of cells per crypt, observed as a reduced crypt height in thetreated group, suggests that compensatory cell proliferation may occur as well(Kleibeuker et al., 1995).IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 1401-Hydroxyanthraquinone
(a)Humans
No data were available to the Working Group.
(b)Experimental systems
Little information is available on the toxic effects of 1-hydroxyanthraquinone in
experimental animals, and no acute toxicity studies have been reported. A group ofACI/N rats fed 1.5% 1-hydroxyanthraquinone in the diet for 48 weeks showed inflam-matory changes of various degrees (colitis, ulcerative colitis or melanosis coli) in thelarge bowel, but no clinical sign of toxicity (Tanaka et al. , 1995). 
1-Hydroxyanthraquinone was fed in the diet (0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%) to male
Fischer 344 rats for seven days. Induction of cell proliferation in the intestines was ana-lysed by BrdU labelling. At the high dose, 1-hydroxyanthraquinone induced cell proli-feration in the caecum and the proximal colorectum, but there was little evidence ofintestinal cytotoxicity (Toyoda et al., 1994).
1-Hydroxyanthraquinone is a constituent of the heartwood of Tabebuia avellanedae
(Burnett & Thompson, 1967; Steinert et al. , 1996) and the roots of Morinda officinalis
and Damnacanthus indicus (Yang et al. , 1992). No reports documenting toxicity of any
of these three plants appear to have been published.
1,3-Dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethylanthraquinone (lucidin)
(a)Humans
No data were available to the Working Group. 
(b)Experimental systems
No information was available on general toxic effects of lucidin. However, this com-
pound is a known constituent of the roots of Rubia tinctorum (madder) (Burnett &
Thomson, 1968a), and one study has been published on the acute and subacute toxicityof madder root. A 14-day toxicity test was conducted on an aqueous extract of madderroot administered by gavage to (C57BL/6 ×C3H)F
1mice. The maximum tolerated dose
was between 3500 and 5000 mg/kg bw. A subacute toxicity test was then performed on62 mice of each sex with madder root extract incorporated into their diet at 0, 0.3, 0.6,1.25, 2.5 or 5% for 90 days. All mice tolerated these doses well, and none showedclinical signs of toxicity or adverse effects on body weight gain. Histopathological exa-mination showed retention cysts of the kidneys and epidermal vaginal cysts in a few ofthe treated and control mice. It was concluded that dietary exposure to madder root at thedoses tested had no significant acute or subacute toxic effects on mice (Ino et al. , 1995).

1-Hydroxyanthraquinone
1-Hydroxyanthraquinone induced frameshift mutations in Salmonella typhimurium
TA1537 in the absence of metabolic activation; addition of liver homogenate led to areduction of the mutagenic activity. In strains TA98 and TA100, no mutagenic effectswere seen. The induction of unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes in vitro was
studied independently by two groups and a positive response was found in both studies.
A few studies were available on genotoxic effects of alizarin, a metabolite of 1-
hydroxyanthraquinone. Alizarin was weakly mutagenic in S. typhimurium TA1537 in the
presence of S9 and in rat hepatocyte DNA-repair assays, but it was consistently inactivein transformation experiments with C3H/M2 mouse fibroblasts and in Hprt mutation
assays with Chinese hamster V79 cells (Westendorf et al., 1990).
1,3-Dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethylanthraquinone (lucidin)
A positive response was obtained with lucidin in Salmonella /microsome reverse
mutation assays in strains TA100, TA102, TA104, TA1537, TA1538 and TA98. Thehighest activity was seen in the frameshift strain TA1537 and in the base substitutionstrain TA100. The compound was mutagenic in these assays in the absence of metabolicactivation and addition of liver homogenate had no major effect on the mutagenicpotency. Lucidin also gave positive results in unscheduled DNA synthesis experimentswith rat liver cells, it caused gene mutations in Chinese hamster V79 cells (without acti-vation) and it transformed mouse fibroblasts. With polynucleotides in vitro the
compound binds to DNA bases. The only data from an in-vivo study indicated that DNAadducts were present in various organs of mice fed lucidin (2 mg per day per animal forIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 142SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 143Table 1.

which lucidin gave a negative response was the Drosophila wing-spot test.
4.5 Mechanistic considerations
1-Hydroxyanthraquinone
There is some evidence that 1-hydroxyanthraquinone is genotoxic. In rats, induction
of cell proliferation in vivo was seen in the caecum which was paralleled by enhanced
ornithine decarboxylase activity (Mori et al., 1992). In a combination experiment with
methylazoxymethanol acetate (given by single intraperitoneal injection) and 1-hydroxy-anthraquinone (1% in diet; 40 weeks), the level of tumour necrosis factor αwas
increased when rats were exposed to the combination compared with the groups thatreceived either compound alone. It was postulated that this might account for the syner-gistic carcinogenic effect of these compounds (see Section 3.2.2) (Yoshimi et al. , 1994).
In studies of mutations in cancer-related genes from tumours of rats exposed to methyl-azoxymethanol acetate and 1-hydroxyanthraquinone, specific mutations were found inthe gene encoding β-catenin but not in other genes such as apc(Suzui et al., 1999).
1,3-Dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethylanthraquinone (lucidin)
Lucidin is genotoxic in vitro and in vivo (Westendorf et al. , 1988). Data on carcino-
genic activity of this compound were not available, but it has been shown that madderroot ( Rubia tinctorum ) — which contains lucidin — causes tumours in liver and kidneys
of rats. The DNA-adduct pattern from colon, liver and kidneys of rats showed one adductthat was also found when deoxyguanosine-3 ′-monophosphate was incubated with luci-
din in vitro . This supports the assumption that lucidin is involved in the carcinogenic
effects of Rubia tinctorum (Westendorf et al. , 1998). It has been hypothesized that luci-
din is activated by phase II enzymes through substitution of the hydroxymethyl group,followed by hydrolytic cleavage, leading to the formation of a DNA-reactive methylenemetabolite or carbenium ion (Poginsky et al., 1991).SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 1455.  Summary of Data Reported and Evaluation
5.1 Exposure data
Hydroxyanthraquinones are constituents of a number of plant species including
Rubia tinctorum (madder root) and Morinda officinalis that are used in traditional herbal
medicines. 1,3-Dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethylanthraquinone (lucidin) occurs in R. tincto-
rum in the form of glycoside conjugates, and 1-hydroxyanthraquinone similarly occurs
in M. officinalis .
5.2 Human carcinogenicity data
Herbs containing anthraquinone derivatives
Herbs containing anthraquinone derivatives are used as laxatives and several studies
have reported data relating indices of use of such laxatives to cancer outcomes. In anearly British study, patients with gastrointestinal cancer reported higher past chronic useof senna than did patients with other diseases. Three German case–control studies oncolorectal cancer using melanosis coli as an exposure indicator gave conflicting results.An Australian case–control study on colorectal cancer which assessed self-reported useof anthraquinone laxatives as an index of exposure found no excess risk. A study of uro-thelial cancer in Germany found elevated relative risks in relation to several types oflaxative, including those containing anthraquinones. For all of these case–control studies,it is difficult to exclude bias and confounding from dietary habits, constipation or use ofanalgesics. Except for two studies (the Australian colorectal cancer and the German uro-thelial cancer studies), selection of controls is also a major concern.
5.3 Animal carcinogenicity data
1-Hydroxyanthraquinone was tested for carcinogenicity by oral administration in
three studies in rats and induced adenocarcinomas of the large intestine in two studies. 
No carcinogenicity tests have been carried out with 1,3-dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl-
anthraquinone (lucidin) per se , although the herb madder root ( Rubia tinctorum ) (which
contains this compound among others) was tested by oral administration in rats. Madderroot caused an increase in hepatocellular adenomas and adenomas and carcinomas of therenal cortex in males and females in a single experiment.IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 1465.4 Other relevant data
1-Hydroxyanthraquinone is metabolized by rats and excreted as alizarin (1,2-di-
hydroxyanthraquinone). When given orally to rats, it induced inflammatory changes inthe colon. It is mutagenic in bacteria and causes unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat livercells in vitro .
Lucidin primeveroside is hydrolysed in rats to the aglycones 1,3-dihydroxy-2-
hydroxymethylanthraquinone (lucidin) and rubiadin, which are excreted in urine.Lucidin is mutagenic in bacteria, mutagenic and genotoxic in cultured mammalian cellsand forms DNA adducts in mice.
5.5 Evaluation
There is inadequate evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of laxatives contai-
ning anthraquinone derivatives.
There is sufficient evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of
1-hydroxyanthraquinone.
There is limited evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of madder
root ( Rubia tinctorum ).
Overall evaluation
1-Hydroxyanthraquinone is possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) .
Madder root ( Rubia tinctorum ) is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans
(Group 3) .
