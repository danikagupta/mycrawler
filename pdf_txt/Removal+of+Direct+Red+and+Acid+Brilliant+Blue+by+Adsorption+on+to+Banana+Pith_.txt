Abstract 
Humic acid (HA) was isolated from lignite. Flocculent HA was made and used to adsorb and remove dye acid red 3R 
from aqueous solution. The adsorption experiments were carried out in a batch process to observe the effect of 
various parameters such as contact time, dose of flocculent HA, ionic strength (NaCl) as well as adsorption kinetics 
and isotherm. Results showed that adsorption of acid red 3R on flocculent HA could reach equilibrium at less than 
180 min. The adsorption kinetics obeyed the pseudo-second order model (R2=0.994). The adsorption was described 
with Freundlich equation on the basis of value of regression coefficient (R2=0.984). The removal rate of the dye 
increased with the increase of the dose of flocculent HA, while it decreased with the addition of NaCl in the aqueous 
solution. These suggested that the adsorption mechanism was the electrostatic attraction, to form hydrogen bonds, 
and van der waals' force between molecules of HA and acid red 3R. Conclusion was made that flocculent HA isolated 
from lignite could be used as an adsorbent to remove the dye from aqueous solution.

1. Introduction 
Dyes are commonly used in many industries, such as food, paper, rubber, plastics, and textile  [1]. It is 
estimated to be more than 100,000 commercially available dyes with over 7×105 tons of dye-stuff 
produced annually [2]. The presence of the dye component in the discharge not only increases the overall 
loading of chemical oxygen demand (COD) to the receiving water but also creates an aesthetic nuisance 
to the environment even when the concentration is as low as 1 mg/L [3]. Moreover, several commonly 
can be used to remove different types of dyes from aqueous solution [5-7]. Suitable adsorbents include 
activated carbon [8], peat [9], chitin [10], silica [11], and others [12-14]. However, adsorption with these

adsorbents presents the disadvantage of generating a large volume of sludge. This sludge is rich in dyes, 
as well as other substances used in the textile process, must be discarded properly to avoid generating 
second contamination [15]. On the other hand, the regeneration of these absorbents is difficult.  
Humic acid (HA) is a principal component of humic substances which are the major organic 
constituents of soil, peat, lignite [16]. It is a complex mixture of many different acids containing aromatic 
rings and aliphatic chains which carry carboxyl, phenolate groups and other O-, N- and S-containing 
functional groups. Due to having a group of polar groups and non-polar fragments, HA can interact with 
metal ions, minerals and organic compounds. 
In previous articles, adsorption of environmental pollutants on condensed or dissolved HA isolated 
from soil was investigated [17-18]. Usually the purpose of their work was to reveal the transportation or 
fate of contaminates in environmental media. In this paper, flocculent HA isolated from lignite was used 
as an adsorbent to remove dye (acid red 3R) from aqueous solution. Because of having larger surface area, 
flocculent HA has strong adsorption capacity. On the other hand, the sludge with HA and dyes can be 
used as fuel directly and no second contamination will be generated.

2.2. Extraction and purification of lignite HA 
Lignite was collected from Huolinhe Coal Mining Company (Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region, 129  Duanping Xu et al.  /  Procedia Environmental Sciences   18  ( 2013 )  127 – 134 
Northwest China), and then it was air-dried, pulverized and sieved with a 120-mesh sieve. The extraction 
and purification of HA was performed according to NAGOYA method [19]. Briefly, 1.0 kg of lignite 
sample was added to a flask with 10 L of 0.05 M HCl. The flask was intermittently shaken at 25°C for 18 
h. Subsequently, the lignite was separated from water by centrifugation at 3, 000 × g for 20 min, and it 
was washed twice with distilled water. The lignite was added with 10 L of 0.1 M NaOH solution, and 
then it was intermittently shaken at 25°C for 18 hours supplemented with N 2. The supernatant was 
collected from the lignite residue by centrifugation at 3, 000 × g for 20 min and transferred to a glass 
beaker. The basification and separation process was repeated until a light brown color of supernatant was 
observed. In order to separate HA from fulvic acid (under the condition of acidity, HA will deposit while 
fulvic acid will not), all the supernatant was collected and acidified to pH 1-1.5 with 6 M HCl. The HA 
precipitate was added with 1 L of HF-HCl solution (0.1 M HF/0.1 M HCl) and shaken at 25°C for 2 h. 
The mixture was then separated by centrifugation at 3, 000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant with 
silicate was removed. The process was repeated three times, and HA with little ash was obtained. Finally, 
cation exchange resin was used to remove ions, and the purified HA was freezing-dried, ground to fine 
powder for adsorption experiments. 
2.3. Adsorption experiments 
The adsorption experiments were carried out in a batch process by using aqueous solution of dye acid 
red 3R with flocculent HA to observe the effect of various parameters such as contact time, initial 
concentration, pH of solution, HA dose, ionic strength (NaCl). Experiment on contact time was conducted 
as follows. Dye solutions were prepared by dissolving acid red 3R in double distilled water to 1 g/L, and 
then diluted to 120 mg/L. 30 mg of HA sample and 15 mL of 0.05 M NaOH solution were added into a 
100-mL glass stoppered conical flask. The flask was intermittently shaken at 25°C for 2 hours until the 
HA was completely dissolved. Then 10 mL of 0.1 M HCl solution was added into the flask until the 
dissolved HA flocculated and flocculent HA was made. Subsequently, 25 mL of acid red 3R solution at a 
concentration of 120 mg/L was added to the flask, and the pH=2. The flask was then shaken in the 
shaking table at 130 rpm and 30°C. After shaking for 30, 60, 120, 210, 300, 420, 600, 900, 1,200 and 
1,440 min, flasks (three parallel samples ) were taken out, respectively. The supernatant was filtrated with 
an UV/Visible spectrometer (TU 1810 made in Puxi company, China. Error of absorbance caused by 
filtrating with the membrane is less than 2%). The amount of adsorbed dye was determined by the mass 
balance equation: 
 
q = V (C 0Ci)/m                                                               (1) 
In the adsorption isotherm study, 25 mL of acid red 3R solution with different concentrations (from 20 
mg/L to 2,000 mg/L) was mixed with 25 mL of solution containing 30 mg flocculent HA (made as the 
process described above), respectively. The mixtures were then shaken in the shaking table for 24 h, 
supernatant was filtrated with membrane, and then the filtrate was analyzed by the method described 
above.  
The pH effect on dye removal of acid red 3R from aqueous solution was investigated in a similar way 
as described above at different initial pH (0.5-6, because HA could be dissolved in solution when pH > 7). 
The initial concentration of dye was 60 mg/L and the amount of flocculent HA was 30 mg. The dosage 
effect on dye removal was evaluated with the dye at an initial concentration of 60 mg/L, pH=2, and the 
amount of HA added ranged from 5 to 250 mg. The ionic strength effect on the dye removal was studied 
with different amounts of NaCl (from 0 - 0.5 mol/L). The initial concentration of solution was 60 mg/L, 
the amount of flocculent HA was 30 mg and pH = 2.  130   Duanping Xu et al.  /  Procedia Environmental Sciences   18  ( 2013 )  127 – 134 
3 Results and Discussion  
3.1. Effect of contact time  
In order to investigate adsorption equilibrium time and adsorption kinetics model of acid red 3R on 
flocculent HA, the adsorption experiment was carried out as a function of contact time, and the results are 
shown in Fig. 2. The Figure indicates that the adsorption is quite rapid in the first 30 min ( qe = 23 mg/g 
when t = 30 min), then gradually increased with the prolongation of contact time. qe = 26.9 mg/g when t = 
60 min, qe = 34.6 mg/g while  t = 120 min. After 180 min of contact, no obvious variation in qe is 
examined. Based on these results, 180 min is taken as the equilibrium time.  
In physical adsorption, most of the adsorbate species are adsorbed within a short interval of contact 
time. However, strong chemical binding of the adsorbate with adsorbent requires a longer contact time for 
the attainment of equilibrium. A large number of vacant surface sites are available for adsorption during 
the initial stage, the occurrence of solute transfer only due to sorbate and sorbent interactions with 
negligible interference due to solute solute interactions. While after a lapse of time, the remaining vacant 
surface sites are difficult to be occupied due to repulsive forces between the solute molecules on the solid 
and bulk phases [20]. The adsorption equilibrium can reach fast, which may be caused by the huge 
specific surface of flocculent HA.

3.2 Adsorption kinetics  
 In order to investigate the mechanism of adsorption, the pseudo-first-order adsorption, and the 
pseudo-second order adsorption model were used to test dynamical experimental data. The pseudo-first 
order rate expression of Lagergren [21] is given as: 
tkq qqe t e303.2log) (log1
10 10                                                                                   (2) 
The slopes and intercepts of plots of log (qe- qt) vs. t were used to determine the first-order rate constant 
k1. In many cases the pseudo-first-order equation of Lagergren does not fit well to the whole range of 
contact time and is generally applicable over the initial stage of the adsorption processes. 
The pseudo-second-order kinetic model is expressed as [22- 23]: 
e e t qt
qk qt
2
21                                                                    (3) 131  Duanping Xu et al.  /  Procedia Environmental Sciences   18  ( 2013 )  127 – 134 
The slopes and intercepts of plots of t/q t vs. t were used to calculate the second-order rate constant k 2 
and q e. It is more likely to predict the behavior over the whole range of adsorption and is in agreement 
with an adsorption mechanism being the rate-controlling step.  
Data from Fig. 2 were regressed with Lagergren first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetics, and the 
results are shown in Fig. 3. The correlation coefficient R2 shows that the adsorption of acid red 3R on HA 
can be approximated more favorably by the pseudo-second order model (R2=0.994) than the pseudo-first 
order model (R2=0.9308). The pseudo-second-order model is on the assumption that the adsorption 
mechanism may be chemical adsorption or chemisorptions, which suggests that the adsorption may 
involve valence forces through sharing or exchange of electrons between acid red 3R and HA.

3.3. Adsorption isotherm  
Adsorption isotherm model is fundamental in describing the interactive behavior between adsorbate 
and adsorbent. Analysis of isotherm data is important for predicting the adsorption capacity of the 
adsorbent, which is one of the main parameters required for the design of an adsorption system. Henry, 
Freundlich and Langmuir equation are usually used to describe adsorption model. Different models 
express the mechanism of adsorption. Henry model suggests that the partition of adsorbate between 
adsorbent and solution is constant, that is partition. The adsorption may take place in the holes of flexible 
segments of adsorbent. A basic assumption of the Langmuir theory is that the adsorption takes place at 
specific homogenous sites in the adsorbent. The model does not take into account the variation in 
adsorption energy. It is based on the physical hypothesis that the maximum adsorption capacity consists 
of a monolayer adsorption, that there are no interactions between adsorbed molecules, and that the 
adsorption energy is distributed homogeneously over the entire coverage surface [24]. While Freundlich 
isotherm model is an empirical equation based on the assumption that adsorption occurs on a 
heterogeneous adsorption surface. It considers multilayer adsorption with a heterogeneous energetic 
distribution of active sites, accompanied by interactions between adsorbed molecules [25]. This model 
can be applied to non-ideal adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces as well as multi-layer adsorption. 
Adsorption experiment data of acid red 3R on flocculent HA are shown in Fig. 4. The data were also 
repressed with Henry, Freundlich and Langmuir equation respectively and the regression coefficients (R2) 
are 0.959, 0.984 and 0.974 respectively. The result shows that the adsorption of acid red 3R on HA fits 
Henry, Freundlich and Langmuir models. But the Freundlich model represents the experimental data 
better on the basis of the values of regression coefficients. This suggests that the adsorption mechanism a b 132   Duanping Xu et al.  /  Procedia Environmental Sciences   18  ( 2013 )  127 – 134 
may be the electrostatic attraction, to form hydrogen bonds or van der waals' force between molecules of 
HA and acid red 3R.

3.4. Effect of the dose of flocculent HA on the sorption 
In order to evaluate the effect of flocculent HA dose on dye removal, the experiment with different 
flocculent HA dosages (from 5 mg to 250 mg) at 30 °C was preformed. The concentration of the dye in 
solution was 60 mg/L, pH was 2, and the volume of solution was 50 mL. Fig. 5 shows the amount of dye 
removal by flocculent HA. The results demonstrate that the removal rate is positively correlated with the 
amount of HA added. A rapid removal rate increases with the addition of flocculent HA when the dosage 
is less than 60 mg and then the percentage removal increases slowly. When the amount of HA added is 
200 mg, the highest removal is almost reached (98.7%). Such a trend is mainly attributed to the fact that 
with increase in the amount of the adsorbent, the adsorptive surface area increases which provides a 
greater number of active sites for adsorption [26].

3.5. Effect of ionic strength on the sorption 
There are a number of studies showing the changing of the percentage removal of dye with the 133  Duanping Xu et al.  /  Procedia Environmental Sciences   18  ( 2013 )  127 – 134 
concentration of various electrolyte types in the dye medium [27]. The effect of ionic strength on the 
removal rate of acid red 3R using flocculent HA was studied at 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.5 mol/L NaCl 
concentrations, 30 oC and pH = 2. The results are demonstrated in Fig. 6. As seen in the figure, the 
presence of inorganic salt (NaCl) has influenced the removal rate of acid red 3R from aqueous solution. 
The percentage removal of the dye in aqueous solution decreases with the increase of NaCl concentration, 
when the concentration of NaCl is les
inorganic salt. The results suggest that the presence of inorganic salt (NaCl) will hinder the adsorption of 
the dye on flocculent HA. Theoretically, when the electrostatic forces between the adsorbent surface and 
adsorbate ions were attractive, an increase in ionic strength will decrease the adsorption capacity. 
Conversely, when the electrostatic attraction is repulsive, an increase in ionic strength will increase 
adsorption [28-29]. The results suggest the electrostatic forces between flocculent HA surface and acid 
red 3R ions were attractive.

4 Conclusions 
From what discussed above, conclusions can be made as follows: 
(1) Adsorption of acid red 3R on flocculent HA can reach equilibrium quickly (180 min) because of the 
high specific surface of flocculent HA. The adsorption kinetics obeys the pseudo-second order model 
(R2=0.994), which suggests that the adsorption may involve valence forces through sharing or exchange 
of electrons between acid red 3R and flocculent HA. 
(2) The adsorption of acid red 3R on flocculent HA can be described by Freundlich equation on the 
basis of the value of regression coefficient (R2=0.984). This suggests that the adsorption mechanism may 
be the electrostatic attraction, to form hydrogen bonds or van der waals' force between molecules of HA 
and acid red 3R. 
(3) The removal rate of the dye increases with the increase of the flocculent HA dose, while the value 
decreases with the addition of NaCl. 
(4) Flocculent HA isolated from lignite can be used an adsorbent to remove dyes from aqueous solution.
