Aims: In the present study, activated carbon obtained from pistachio hull waste 
ash was used as an adsorbent for the successful removal of reactive red 198 
dye from aqueous solutions.
Materials and Methods: The effect of various operating parameters such as initial concentration of dye (20-200 mg/L), contact time (5-270 min), adsorbent dosage 
(0.1-5 g/L) and pH (2-12) was investigated. Furthermore, equilibrium isotherms 
were used to identify the possible mechanism of the adsorption process.Results: Maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was 253.67 mg/g at 
pH 2, initial concentration of 80 mg/L and 25°C, when 95.13% of the dye was 
removed. Furthermore, the equilibrium data were also fitted to the Langmuir and Freundlich equilibrium isotherm models. It was found that the data fitted to 
Freundlich ( R

The textile industry consumes large volumes of water in different wet processes; therefore, very large amounts of textile wastewater, which is heavily charged with unconsumed dyes and other chemical are produced.
[1] About 10-20% of the total dyestuff 
used in the dyeing process is released into the environment.[2]
Dyes are one of the most hazardous chemical compound classes found in industrial effluents and need to be treated 
[Downloaded free from http://www.ijehe.org on Friday, February 3, 2023, IP: 5.238.148.222]Bazrafshan, et al .: Decolorization of reactive red 198 by adsorptionInternational Journal of Environmental Health Engineering  |  Vol. 2  •  Issue 6  |  November-December 2013 39effluents.[17,18] However, this approach presents the disadvantage 
of generating a large volume of sludge. This sludge is rich in 
dyes as well as other substances used in the textile process. This is a problem, as the waste must be discarded properly to 
avoid environmental contamination.
[16] Furthermore, biological 
and enzymatic treatment,[11,19-22] ozone treatment,[11,23,24] 
nanoparticles,[25] chemical oxidation and photocatalytic 
processes,[12,26,27] photochemical and sonochemical processes,[28] 
and membrane processes[9,11,29] were used for removal of dye from 
textile effluents. However, some of these methods are limited 
due to their high operational costs and problems.
The most efficient procedure for removal of synthetic dyes 
from industrial effluents is the adsorption procedure, because 
the dye species are transferred from the water effluent to a 
solid phase, diminishing the effluent volume to a minimum. Subsequently, the adsorbent can be regenerated or kept in a 
dry place without direct contact with the environment.
[4] Also, 
adsorption has proven to be a reliable treatment methodology 
due to its low capital investment cost, simplicity of design, 
ease of operation and insensitivity to toxic substances, but its 
application is limited by the high price of some adsorbents 
and the large amounts of wastewater normally involved. 
Activated carbon,[30,31] mesoporous carbon,[32] clay minerals,[33] 
hydrotalcite,[34] biopolymers such as chitosan beads[35] and 
quaternary chitosan[36] and agricultural by-products[37,38] are 
a few of the adsorptive materials that have been tested for the treatment of wastewaters.
In order to reduce preparation cost, the use of low cost 
starting materials (industrial or agricultural residues) for activated carbon preparation has emerged as a potential 
alternative.
[39] Besides the cost reduction, the conversion of 
agriculture waste in low cost adsorbents also added value to this residues and solve the problem of biomass disposal. Agricultural waste-based carbon has the advantage of 
exhibiting low ash content, reasonable hardness and high surface area and/or adequate porous structures.
[29,39]
The choice of activated carbon precursor largely depends on 
its availability, cost and purity, but the manufacturing process 
and intended applications of the product are also important 
considerations.[40] Therefore evaluation of biomass is getting 
increased attention in all over the world as it is renewable, widely available, cheap and environmental friendly.
[41]
Iran is one of the major pistachio (Pistacia vera) producer 
and exporter country. Pistachio production is nearly 200,000 
t/year.[41] Thus, pistachio wastes generated from pistachio 
processing has a major economic importance and exhibits a 
high affinity for dyes. Therefore, in this study, adsorption of 
reactive red 198 (RR198) from aqueous solutions on activated 
carbon prepared from pistachio hull wastes was studied. The 
effects of different parameters including initial pH, adsorbent 
dosage, RR198 concentration and contact time were studied. In addition, the sorption isotherm was explored to describe 
the experimental data.MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals and reagents
RR198 is an anionic dye with molecular weight of 968.21 
g/mol and λmax = 530 nm. The RR198 (C27H18ClN7Na4O15S5) 
used in this work was the analytical grade (Merck, Germany). 
The chemical formula of RR198 is shown in Figure 1. For 
treatment experiments, the dye solutions with concentrations in the range of 20-200 mg/L were prepared by successive dilution of the stock solution (1000 mg/L) with distilled water. All other chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade.
Adsorbent preparation
Pistachio hull wastes ( Pistacia vera ) used in the batch 
experiments were collected from lands near to Rafsanjan city (30°23´ N, 56°00´ E) of Kerman province in the southeastern part of Iran. This natural wastes were firstly 
washed with distilled water to remove impurity such as 
sand and leaves and soluble and colored components, 
dried at 110°C for 2 h, crushed in a domestic grinder and 
sieved to obtain particle size in the range of 60-200 mesh. Then a mixture of 250 g of powdered adsorbent, 110 g of ZnCl
2 and 110 g of water was kept overnight and then the 
mixture was calcinated at 350°C. Then, chemically prepared activated carbon was washed with water and dried. The activated carbon was then used in adsorption experiments. 
No other chemical or physical treatments were used prior 
to adsorption experiments.
Dye removal experiments
Dye removal experiments with the pistachio hull waste ash were carried out as batch tests in 250 mL flasks under magnetic stirring. Each test consisted of preparing a 100 mL of dye solution with a desired initial concentration and pH 
by diluting the stock dye solution with distilled water and 
transferring it into the beaker on the magnetic stirrer. The pH of the solution was adjusted using 1 N hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide solutions. A known mass of pistachio hull waste ash (adsorbent dosage) was then added to the solution and the obtained suspension was immediately 
stirred for a pre-defined time. After the desired contact 
time, the samples were withdrawn from mixture by using a micropipette and centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm. After centrifuged, supernatants were analyzed for the determination of the final concentration of RR198 by using

was obtained as follows:

Where, C0 and Ce are the initial and equilibrium liquid 
phase concentration of RR198 (mg/L), respectively. V is 
the volume of the solution (L) and M is the amount of adsorbent used (g).
To express the percent of dye removal, the following equation 
was used:
 (2)
Where, C0 and Cf represent the initial and final (after 
adsorption) dye concentrations, respectively. All tests were performed in duplicate to insure the reproducibility of the 
results; the mean of the two measurements is reported. All 
experiments were performed at room temperature (~25°C). 
The investigated ranges of the experimental variables were as follows: RR198 dye concentration (20, 30, 50, 70, 80, 
100, 150 and 200 mg/L), pH of solution (2-12), adsorbent 
dosage (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 g/L) and mixing time (5-270 min).
RESULTS
Effect of initial pH
In our experimental study, for study the effect of pH on the RR198 adsorption capacities of the activated carbon 
from pistachio hull wastes, adsorption experiments were 
conducted at varying pH (pH 2-12) with 80 mg/L fixed initial dye concentrations and adsorbent dosage 0.3 g/L for 60 min 
and the results are shown in Figure 2. As can be seen from 
Figure 2, a decrease in pH from 12 to 2 caused a significant increase in the amount of RR198 adsorbed by adsorbent. The 
maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was 253.67 
mg/g at pH 2, initial concentration of 80 mg/L and 25°C, when 95.13% of the dye was removed.
Effect of adsorbent dosage
In order to determine the effect of adsorbent dosage on adsorption, 0.1-5 g/L adsorbent were used for adsorption 
experiments at fixed initial pH (pH 2), initial dye concentration 
(80 mg/L) and temperature (25°C) for 60 min.
As it can be seen from Figures 3 and 4 the percentage of 
RR198 removal steeply increases with the adsorbent loading 
up to 0.3 g/L. The maximum adsorption efficiency of RR198 
onto adsorbent was found to be 96.23% (256.6 mg/g) at 
adsorbent concentration of 0.3 g/L.Figure 2: Effect of initial pH on reactive red 198 adsorption

Figure 5 shows the effect of 
contact time on the adsorption capacity and percent removal of RR198 dye onto the activated carbon from pistachio 
hull wastes at different initial concentrations. According to 
Figure 5 the RR198 was rapidly adsorbed in the first 20 min (73.63%) and then the adsorption rate decreased gradually from 20 min to 270 min and finally reached to equilibrium 
in about 120 min. Furthermore, the maximum efficiency 
(96.19%) for removal of RR198 was obtained at contact time 
60 min (256.5 mg/g).
Effect of initial RR198 dye concentration
In this study, the effects of initial dye concentration on 
adsorption were studied at 25°C and 0.3 g/L adsorbent concentrations for 60 min. As can be seen from Figure 6, 
when the initial dye concentration is increased, the amounts 
of adsorbed dye also increase, so the removal of dye depends on the concentration of the dye. For example, when the initial RR198 concentration increases from 20 mg/L to 200 mg/L, the equilibrium sorption capacities of activated carbon from 
pistachio hull wastes increase from 59.76 (89.64%) to 629.97 
mg/g (94.5%).
Adsorption isotherms
Isotherms study can describe how an adsorbate interacts with adsorbent. The isotherm provides a relationship between the concentration of dye in solution and the amount of dye adsorbed on the solid phase when both phases are in equilibrium. Figures 7 and 8 shows the equilibrium isotherms for the adsorption of RR198 dye onto pistachio hull waste and the equilibrium adsorption data were analyzed by using the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. The Langmuir isotherm model is valid for monolayer adsorption onto surface containing finite number of identical sorption sites, which is presented by the following equation:

amount of adsorbent (mg/g), Ce is equilibrium concentration 
of the solution (mg/L) and qm is the maximum amount 
of RR198 dye required to form a monolayer (mg/g). The 
Langmuir equation can be rearranged to linear form for 
the convenience of plotting and determining the Langmuir 
constants (KL) and maximum monolayer adsorption capacity 
of adsorbent (qm). The values of qm and KL can be determined 
from the linear plot of 1/qe versus 1/Ce:

The Freundlich equation is purely empirical based on sorption on heterogeneous surface, which is commonly 
described by the following equation:

where, Kf and 1/n are the Freundlich constants related to 
adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity, respectively. 
The Freundlich equilibrium constants evaluated from the 
intercept and the slope, respectively of the linear plot of log 
qe versus log Ce based on experimental data. The Freundlich 
equation can be linearized in logarithmic form for the determination of the Freundlich constants as shown below:

The isotherms based on the experimental data and the parameters obtained from nonlinear regression by both 
models are shown in Figures 7 and 8. Also, all parameters 
are listed in 
DISCUSSION
Effect of initial pH
It is known that the solution pH can affect the surface charge 
of the adsorbent, the degree of ionization of the different 
pollutants, the dissociation of functional groups on the 
active sites of the adsorbent as well as the structure of the 
dye molecule.[42] the solution pH would affect both aqueous 
chemistry and surface binding-sites of the adsorbent. Hence, 
the solution pH is an important parameter during the dye 
adsorption process
As can be seen from Figure 2, a decrease in pH from 12 
to 2 caused a significant increase in the amount of RR198 
adsorbed by adsorbent. On the other hand, the adsorption of RR198 dye onto activated carbon from pistachio hull 
wastes is intimately dependent on solution pH. It could be 
seen that the uptake of RR198 increased with decreasing 
pH form 12 to 2 until equilibrium obtained. The maximum 
adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was 253.67 mg/g at pH 2, initial concentration of 80 mg/L and 25°C, when 95.13% of 
the dye was removed. Similar results were reported by other researchers.
[13,43-45] at acidic conditions, binding sites of the 
adsorbent would be closely associated with the hydrogen ions, 
which act as bridging ligands between the adsorbent surface 
and the dye molecule.[46] The lower pH values can be suitable 
for the adsorption of reactive dye.[47-50]
Effect of adsorbent dosage
The adsorbent concentration is an important parameter because this determines the capacity of the adsorbent 
(activated carbon from pistachio hull waste) for a given 
initial RR198 concentration. As it can be seen from Figures 3 
and 4 the percentage of RR198 removal steeply increases with the adsorbent loading up to 0.3 g/L. This result can be explained by the fact that the sorption sites remain 
unsaturated during the sorption, whereas the number 
of sites available for sorption site increases by increasing the adsorbent dose. There was a non-significant increase 
in the percentage removal of RR198 when the adsorbent 
concentration increases beyond the 0.3 g/L and even in contrast with, a few of decrease in removal efficiency 
was determined. This suggests that after a certain dose 
of adsorbent, the maximum adsorption is attained and hence the amount of pollutants remains constant even with further addition of dose of adsorbent.
[51] Also, when 
the adsorbent dosage increased, percentage removal of RR198 also increased (up to 0.3 g/L adsorbent), but amount of adsorbed RR198 of per gram adsorbent decreased due to the fact that fixed dye concentration (80 mg/L) led to unsaturated active site on adsorbent surface and increase in 
the adsorbent concentrations caused particle aggregation.
[52] 
A similar result was reported by Gulnaz et al.[43]
Effect of contact time
The contact time is one of the most important parameters 
for practical application. As it can be seen from Figure 5, the adsorption capacity and percent removal of RR198 dye onto 
the adsorbent drastically increase during the initial adsorption 
stage and then continue to increase at a relatively slow speed with contact time until a state of equilibrium is attained after 
120 min. In general, the removal rate of sorbate (pollutant) 
is rapid initially, but it gradually decreases with time until it reaches equilibrium. This phenomenon is attributed to the 
fact that a large number of vacant surface sites are available 
for adsorption at the initial stage and after a lapse of time, the 
remaining vacant surface sites are difficult to be occupied due to repulsive forces between the solute molecules on the solid 
and bulk phases. A similar finding was reported by Cengiz 
and Cavas,
[53] and Gulnaz et al.[43]
Effect of initial RR198 dye concentration
The initial concentration provides an important driving force to overcome all mass transfer resistance of the dye between 
the aqueous and solid phases.
[47,54] As can be seen from 
Figure 6, when the initial dye concentration is increased, the amounts of adsorbed dye also increase, so the removal of dye depends on the concentration of the dye. Similar trends have 
[Downloaded free from http://www.ijehe.org on Friday, February 3, 2023, IP: 5.238.148.222]Bazrafshan, et al .: Decolorization of reactive red 198 by adsorptionInternational Journal of Environmental Health Engineering  |  Vol. 2  •  Issue 6  |  November-December 2013 43also been observed for Methylene blue dye sorption onto 
bamboo-based activated carbon,[55] cotton waste[56] and fly 
ash.[57] This increase in the proportion of removed dye may 
be probably due to equilibrium shift during sorption process. Similar results have also been recorded for adsorption of 
Congo red from aqueous solution onto calcium-rich fly ash,
[58] 
RR198 removal from aqueous solutions by Potamogeton crispus
[43] and 2,4-D herbicide removal by single-walled 
carbon nanotubes.[59]
The initial dye concentrations provide an important 
driving force to overcome the mass transfer resistance of 
the dye between the aqueous phases and the solid phases, 
so increasing initial concentrations would enhance the adsorption capacity of dye. These results is in accordance 
with obtained findings by other researchers.
[53,54]
Adsorption isotherms
The R2 values of Langmuir and Freundlich models [Table 1 
and Figures 7 and 8] are 0.8839 and 0.9289, respectively, indicating that the Freundlich model is more suitable for 
describing the adsorption equilibrium of RR198 dye onto 
activated carbon obtained from pistachio hull wastes. In 
the Langmuir model, it is assumed that the site energy for 
adsorption is the same for all surface sites and does not 
depends on degree of coverage and that the largest capacity 
corresponds to only one monolayer. These assumptions 
are not valid for most adsorbents because, for example, activated carbon has a wide range of pore size that continues 
to adsorb organics as the concentration increases. In 
reality, the site energy of adsorption varies widely for most 
adsorbents because adsorbents, such as activated carbon, are 
very heterogeneous and the site energy varies considerably 
with surface coverage. The Freundlich equation is used 
to describe isotherm data for heterogeneous adsorbents 
(varying site energies) much better than the Langmuir 
equation.
[60]
CONCLUSION
From the present study, it can be seen that the activated carbon from pistachio hull waste can be used effectively 
for the removal of the RR198 dye from aqueous solutions. 
The percentage eliminated was found to depend on the 
amount of adsorbent, the initial concentration of the dye 
and the dye-adsorbent contact time. The activated carbon from pistachio hull wastes was able to remove up to 95% of 
RR198 dye from solutions whose initial concentration varied between 20 mg/L and 200 mg/L. The adsorption of RR198 
dye on activated carbon from pistachio hull wastes has been described by the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm. It 
was found that the data fitted to Freundlich (R
2 = 0.9289) 
better than Langmuir (R2 = 0.8839) model. The removal of 
the dye from aqueous solutions is induced by adsorption on 
surface sites of the solid for low RR198 dye concentration 
while both adsorption and internal exchange take place for 
high concentrations.
