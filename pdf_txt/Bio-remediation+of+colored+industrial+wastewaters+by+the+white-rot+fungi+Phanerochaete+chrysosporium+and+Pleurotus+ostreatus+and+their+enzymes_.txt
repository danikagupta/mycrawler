                                      1SUMMARY 
 
The increasingly stringent  environmental regulations  on hazardous wastes has 
encouraged the search for innovative solutions  for the remediation of contaminated 
wastewaters. In this field, bioremediation is seen as an attractive solution due to its 
reputation as a low cost, environmentally fr iendly and publicly acceptable treatment 
technology.  The present research program explores new strategies for the bi o-treatment of dye-
contaminated wastewaters pr oduced by textile industries. Two kind of processes 
have been specifically analysed: biodegradati on and biosorption based processes.  
Their effectiveness was tested on three text ile wastewater models (Acid, Direct, 
Reactive), by assessing and compari ng their performances in terms of 
decolourisation ability, COD and toxicity  reduction of the treated effluent. 
The inactivated biomasses of three Mucora les fungi have been tested as potential 
candidates for dye biosorption. They displayed good sorption capabilities towards all the tested synthetic effluents, giving rise to decolourisation percentages up to 94% 
and decrease in COD up to 58%, coupled to  a significant toxicity reduction. 
Biodegradation based processes, have been explored from a multiplicity of 
perspectives, by testing the degrading perf ormances of whole-cell as well as 
enzyme-based biosystems, in both free and immobilized forms. The white-rot fungi 
Pleurotus ostreatus  and Phanerochaete chrysosporium  and their oxidative enzymes 
were the object of this investigation. Both fungi showed good decolourisation and 
detoxification capabilities towards the model wastewaters, exhibiting different 
specificities. As far enzymatic biosystems,  the study has been specifically focused on 
laccases from P. ostreatus . Optimal conditions for laccase production by P. ostreatus  
have been defined and an extra-cellular enzyme mixtures, with known laccase 
isoenzyme composition, was produced and te sted for its decolour isation potential, 
showing the best performances towa rd Acid wastewater model.  
The same laccase preparation was successfu lly immobilized on perlite, a siliceous 
inert carrier, and preliminary tested for the conversion of the reactive dye Remazol 
Brilliant Blue R. The immob ilization process was optimized with reference to the 
immobilization yield and to the dye adsorpt ion capacity of the solid biocatalyst. 
Stability and catalytic paramet ers of immobilized laccases, in comparison with those 
observed for free enzyme, were also assessed.   A parallel session of t he project was aimed at identifyi ng and at characterizing new 
members of  P. ostreatus  laccase gene family. This research pathway was ultimately 
targeted at enriching the knowle dge of this complex enzymatic family as well as at 
developing new bio-catalysts for wastewater  treatment. The existence of a laccase 
gene clustering was demonstrated in P. ostreatus  and three new laccase genes were 
cloned, thus enlarging the pa nel of these biocatalysts up to seven members. A 
“laccase subfamily” consisting of three la ccase genes was identif ied. cDNAs coding 
for two of the new laccases were isolated  and expressed in yeasts in order to 
characterize the recombinant proteins. A pe culiar intron-exon structure was revealed 
for one of the new laccases, along with a hi gh instability of t he recombinant enzyme 
due to lability of its copper ligand. 
 
    2RIASSUNTO 
 
I coloranti sintetici sono ampiam ente utilizzati in diversi settori dell’industria, in quello 
tessile in particolare. La produzione mondia le annua è infatti stimata intorno alle 
70.000 tonnellate, di cui una percentuale variabi le tra il 10 ed il 40% è rilasciata nelle 
acque di scarico dell’industria. L’impatto sull’a mbiente di tali scarichi è notevole: molti 
dei convenzionali metodi di tra ttamento chimico-fisici si ri velano, infatti, inadeguati o 
troppo costosi se rapportati a lla complessa struttura chimic a delle molecole coloranti 
e agli ingenti volumi da trattare. In ques to contesto, il ricorso al biorisanamento 
costituisce una tecnologia valida, economic amente sostenibile, e a ridotto impatto 
ambientale da applicare in alternativa ai tradizionali processi di smaltimento. 
Due differenti strategie di  biorisanamento possono essere  applicate al trattamento 
dei reflui industriali: il bioasso rbimento e la bi odegradazione.  
Il bioassorbimento consiste nella rimozi one delle sostanze in quinanti presenti nei 
reflui da parte di biomasse microbiche, vive  o inattivate. Alcuni funghi, grazie alla 
peculiare composizione chimica e strutturale del la loro parete cellul are si sono rivelati 
particolarmente efficaci nell’ assorbire so stanze tossiche di varia natura, tra cui 
coloranti e metalli pesanti presenti nei refl ui dell’industria tessile, con rese di 
rimozione in molti casi maggiori rispetto  ai convenzionali materiali adsorbenti.  
La biodegradazione sfrutta, invece, il natur ale potenziale degradativo di diverse 
specie microbiche (batteri, lieviti, funghi ), per la rottura e la successiva 
trasformazione (ed eventuale completa minerali zzazione) delle sostanze coloranti. In 
particolare, i funghi white-rot  trovano numerose applicazion i nel biorisanamento in 
virtù della loro capacit à di degradare un ampio range  di composti xenobiotici. La loro 
potenzialità risiede nella capacità di sece rnere un complesso sistema di enzimi 
ossidativi -tra cui lignina perossidasi, manga nese perossidasi e laccasi- i quali, per la 
loro bassa specificità di subs trato si rivelano in grado di  degradare diverse classi di 
inquinanti, inclusi molt i coloranti sintetici. 
 Entrambe le strategie di bi orisanamento sono state esami nate in questo progetto di 
tesi. Particolare attenzione è stata rivolta ai  processi di biodegradazione dei reflui, 
esplorandone diversi aspetti: dall’impiego di biosistemi microbici (funghi white-rot P. 
ostreatus  e P. chrysosporium ) a quelli enzimatici -in forma libera o immobilizzata-, 
estendendo lo studio alla ricerca di nuovi geni  codificanti attività ossidasiche nel 
fungo  P. ostreatus .  
Il presente progetto di tesi si articola pert anto in due linee di ricerca : 1) Lo sviluppo e 
l’applicazione di nuovi biosistemi da applicare al trattamento dei reflui colorati e 2) 
L’isolamento di nuovi membri della famiglia della laccasi da P. ostreatus  e la loro 
caratterizzazione mediante espressione eterologa.  
1) Sviluppo e applicazione di nuovi biosistemi per il trattamento dei reflui 
colorati 
Questa sezione del progetto mira allo svilu ppo di biosistemi per il risanamento dei 
reflui dell’industria del colore, basati su ca talizzatori microbici ed enzimatici.  Comune 
denominatore di questa sezione è l’analisi delle performance  degradative dei 
biosistemi in esame in condizioni prossime  a quelle dei reflui reali. In una fase 
preliminare del progetto (nell’ambito del progetto europeo SOPHIED-Sustainable 
Oxidative Processes for Healthy Industrial European Dyes-) sono st ati infatti definiti 
tre reflui modello (Acid, Direct e Reactive) che rifl ettono le caratteristiche dei 
principali reflui dell’industria tessile: in  relazione al tipo di lavorazione da cui essi  3derivano (lana, seta, cotone, pellame), essi di fferiscono per valori di pH, forza ionica, 
nonchè per la struttura e la rea ttività dei coloranti contenuti. Questi in  sintesi i risultati 
ottenuti in relazione ai vari biosistemi analizzati: 
 
- Biosistemi microbici per la biodegradazione dei reflui modello  
Le potenzialità applicative dei funghi white-rot  P. ostreatus  and P. chrysosporium 
sono state analizzate impiegandoli quali cata lizzatori microbici del processo di 
decolorazione. Colture in liq uido dei due funghi sono stat e allestite in ciascuno dei 
reflui modello, in assenza ed in presenza di  nutrienti, monitorando i parametri chiave 
del processo: percentuale di decolorazion e, tossicità e COD (Chemical Oxygen 
demand) residua. P. ostreatus  si è rivelato efficace nel decolorare il refluo Acid 
producendo un 54% di decolorazione dopo 7 gi orni di trattamento in assenza di 
nutrienti, e una riduzione del 30 % della COD. In presenza di  nutrienti, il livello di 
decolorazione raggiunge il 66% , sebbene in questo caso non sia accompagnata da 
una riduzione della COD. La tossi cità dei reflui al termi ne del trattamento è stata 
valutata con il sistema LUMISTOX. Tale sistema utilizza il batterio V. fisheri  quale 
organismo test e si basa sulla misura de ll’inibizione della naturale luminescenza del 
batterio indotta da sostanze tossiche. In ent rambi i casi, il trattamento con il fungo 
comporta una significativa detossificazione del  refluo. Inoltre, l’analisi delle attività 
ossidasiche secrete nel mezzo di coltura nel corso del trattamento, rivela la 
produzione di livelli costanti di attività la ccasica, suggerendo il coinvolgimento delle 
laccasi nel processo di decolorazione. Il trattamento con il fungo P. chrysosporium  si è rivelato invece efficace sul refluo 
Direct, producendo un 46% di decolorazione dopo un solo giorno di trattamento e 
fino all’87% di decolorazione dopo 7 giorni. Il  trattamento risulta efficace solo in 
presenza di nutrienti e non è accompagnato da lla riduzione della COD. Non è stato 
possibile, in questo caso, correlare la decolorazione osservata alla produzione di specifiche attività ossidasiche potenzia lmente coinvolte nel processo, a causa 
dell’interferenza nelle misure di attività enzimatica prodotta dalla colorazione residua 
del refluo. Per lo stesso motivo, non è stato possibile valu tare, con il sistema 
LUMISTOX,  la tossicità residua del  refluo Direct trattato con  P. chysosporium  data 
la scarsa riproducibilità dei risultati ottenuti. Il trattamento con entrambi i funghi si è rive lato invece inefficace sul refluo Reactive, 
probabilmente a causa di fattor i quali, le condizioni di  pH estreme, l’elevata 
concentrazione salina o l’eccessivo contenuto in  coloranti, che inibiscono la crescita 
del fungo. I risultati ottenuti, oltre a dimostrare le  potenzialità di applicazione dei biosistemi 
microbici esaminati, evidenziano le dive rse specificità di degradazione dei due 
funghi, suggerendo, quale prospettiva futura, l’idea di impiegarli in co-colture, al fine 
di combinarne proprietà e potenzialità. 
 
Biosistemi enzimatici in fase libera: laccasi da P. ostreatus
 
Nell’ambito dello sviluppo di biosistemi enzimat ici, lo studio è stato incentrato su una 
classe di enzimi ossi dativi particolarmente interessante dal punto di vista applicativo, 
le laccasi fungine. Le laccasi sono cupr oproteine appartenenti alla classe delle 
fenolo-ossidasi, che catalizzano l’ossid azione di fenoli, polifenoli e ammine 
aromatiche variamente sostituite con relati va riduzione di ossigeno molecolare ad 
acqua. Esse trovano svariate applicazioni bi otecnologiche: dall’in dustria alimentare o 
della carta, al settore te ssile, fino ai processi di biorisanamento dei reflui.  4In molti funghi le laccasi sono codificate  da complesse famiglie di geni, in numero 
variabile da specie a specie, che danno or igine a proteine strettamente relazionate 
ma dotate spesso di proprietà catalit iche differenti. Il fungo basidiomicete Pleurotus 
ostreatus  produce una vasta gamma di isoforme enzimatiche ad attività laccasica, di 
cui sono stati isolati i corri spondenti geni e cDNA . Cinque isoenzimi sono stai finora 
purificati e caratterizzati: POXC, il più abbondantemente prodotto in tutte le 
condizioni di crescita analizzate; POXA1b,  dall’insolita stabilità a pH alcalino; 
POXA1w, particolare per il su o contenuto in ioni metallici; ed infine gli isoenzimi 
POXA3a e POXA3b, atipici per la loro st ruttura eterodimerica e particolarmente 
efficaci nella decolorazione del colorante modello, RBBR.  
 Diverse colture del fungo P. ostreatus  sono state allestite al fine di individuare le 
condizioni ottimali per la produzione di lacc asi. La miscela laccasica prodotta nelle 
migliori condizioni selezi onate (130,000 IU/L) è stata caratterizzata per il suo 
contenuto isoenzimatico ed applicata alla decolo razione dei reflui modello. La stessa, 
si è rivelata efficace nel degradare il  refluo Acid, producendo fino al 35% di 
decolorazione in 24h. Il tempo neces sario ad ottenere lo stesso grado di 
decolorazione si riduce ad 1h, incrementando di 10 volte la concentrazione di 
enzima, fino a 1IU/ml. La decolorazione è accoppiata ad una ridu zione del 30% della 
COD e ad una significativ a detossificazione del refluo. Il  trattamento con la miscela 
laccasica si è rivelato, invece, poco efficace sui reflui Direct e Reactive. Una parziale 
decolorazione del refluo Direct si ottiene soltanto riducendo il pH del refluo verso valori più acidi. Nessun effetto  si osserva invece sul refl uo Reactive anche in seguito 
a variazioni di pH o a diluiz ione del refluo. Pertanto, come  già osservato nel caso del 
trattamento con biosistemi mi crobici, il refluo Reactive si è rivelato  estremamente 
recalcitrante alla biodegradazione. 
 
Biosistemi enzimatici in fase immobilizzata
 
La possibilità di produrre biosistemi enzimatici immobilizzati costituisce 
un’opportunità interessante da applicare al trattam ento dei reflui modello. 
L’immobilizzazione enzimatica, infatti, oltre a consentire il recupero ed il riutilizzo dei 
catalizzatori impiegati nel processo, co mporta, nella maggioranza dei casi, un 
incremento della stabilit à dell’enzima rispetto alla contr oparte in fase libera. Questa 
fase del progetto è stata pertanto finalizza ta alla definizione di una tecnica di 
immobilizzazione di miscele di laccasi prodotte da P. ostreatus  e all’analisi delle 
capacità decoloranti del sistema immobilizzato. La miscela laccasica è stata immobilizzata covalentemente su un supporto siliceo, la 
perlite. La resa del processo è stata ottimizza ta (fino al 70% di at tività immobilizzata 
sul supporto), agendo sia sul grado di derivat izzazione del supporto -variabile nei 
due passaggi successivi di silanizzazione ed attivazione con glutaraldeide- sia su 
parametri quali il rapporto attività  iniziale/g di solido, il pH, la forza ionica, il tempo e 
la temperatura di incubazione con il supporto . Il sistema immobilizzato è stato quindi 
caratterizzato in termini di stabilità e param etri cinetici, ricorrendo per questi ultimi, 
all’immobilizzazione dell’enzima purific ato POXC. I risultati indicano che 
l’immobilizzazione su perlite co mporta un incremento di stabilità del sistema 
immobilizzato sia a temperatura ambiente che a 4°C rispetto alla controparte in fase 
libera. Si osserva inve ce un incremento della K
M, ed una riduzione dell’efficienza 
catalitica dell’enzima immobilizzato nei conf ronti del substrato ABT S. Alterazioni nella 
conformazione dell’enzima causate dall’immobi lizzazione o la ridotta  accessibilità del  5substrato al sito attivo dell’enzima imm obilizzato, possono plausibilmente spiegare i 
dati osservati. Il sistema è stato infine impiegato in un reattore a letto fluidizzato per la 
decolorazione in continuo del colorante modello RBBR. I primi esperimenti di 
decolorazione hanno evidenziato il solo ads orbimento del colorante sul supporto, 
seguito dalla completa inattivazione dell’enzima.  Il protocollo di immobilizzazione è 
stato quindi opport unamente modificato al fine di mi nimizzare le quantità di colorante 
adsorbite sul supporto, mantenendo inalterata la resa di immobilizzazione. I risultati 
preliminari relativi alle prove di decolorazione effe ttuate con il sistema così 
ottimizzato, indicano una conversione del 60 % del colorante, associata però ad una 
disattivazione del catalizzatore pari al  70% dell’attività immobilizzata.  
I risultati fin qui prodotti non sono suffici enti a valutare l’app licabilità di questo 
sistema per la conversione dei  coloranti. Si rendono infatti necessarie ulteriori analisi, 
finalizzate alla caratterizzazione dei param etri cinetici di entrambi i fenomeni 
osservati: la conversione del colorante ed il processo di disattivazione a cui il 
catalizzatore va incontro. Solo un’attent a analisi di tali parametri consentirà una 
completa valutazione delle performances  del sistema ed una stima dei vantaggi 
connessi all’impiego di biosistemi enzimatici imm obilizzati (in termini di volumi trattati, 
costi e tempi di trattamento) rispe tto ai biosistemi in fase libera. 
 - Decolorazione dei reflui modello medi ante bioassorbimento con biomasse fungine
 
In collaborazione con l’Università di Tori no sono state esplorate le capacità di 
biomasse fungine inattivate ( derivanti dai funghi zigomiceti, Cunnighamella elegans, 
Rhizomucor pusillus e Rhizopus stolonifer ) di decolorare e detossificare i reflui 
modello mediante bioassorbimento. Il tratta mento con le biomasse inattivate ha 
determinato una sostanziale e rapida decolorazi one di tutti i reflui studiati. Fino al 
94% di decolorazione può essere  ottenuto dopo già due ore di  trattamento per i reflui 
Acid e Direct, mentre il refluo Reactive è decolorato fino al 65% in un tempo più 
lungo (24 ore). Le biomasse studiate rapp resentano dunque un sistema efficace e 
versatile, esibendo elevate rese di bioasso rbimento nei confront i di coloranti di 
diverse classi chimiche e ne lle differenti condizioni di sa linità e pH che caratterizzano 
i tre reflui modello analizzati. Le elevat e percentuali di decolor azione ottenute sono 
inoltre associate ad una sign ificativa detossificazione dei reflui e ad un notevole 
abbattimento dei valori di COD (fino al  58%) dei tre reflui analizzati.  
 I risultati descritti in questa sezione hanno dunque consentito di analizzare diverse 
alternative da applicare al tra ttamento dei reflui colorati , evidenziandone potenzialità 
e limiti. I processi basati sulla biode gradazione si rivelano economicamente 
competitivi, ma sono spesso caratterizzati da tempi di trattamento lunghi o risultano 
limitati dalle condizioni che caratterizzano i reflui industriali (pH estremi, elevate 
concentrazioni di sali e colo ranti, presenza di additivi e surfattanti). I processi di 
bioassorbimento, d’altro canto, pur risult ando più efficienti e versatili, determinano 
solo un trasferimento del colorante dalla fase liquida alle bi omasse fungine, ponendo 
così il problema dello smaltimento delle bi omasse colorate prodotte alla fine del 
processo. Concludendo, una combinazione di differenti tecniche (sia biologiche come quelle 
descritte, che chimico-fisiche), sostenibili a livello sia tecnologico che economico, e 
finalizzate alla realizzazione  di uno schema integrato di trattamento, sembra essere 
la soluzione più indicata per lo smalti mento dei reflui dell’industria tessile.  6I risultati più significativi, ottenuti con i biosistemi analizzati su ciascun refluo modello, 
sono riassunti in termini di percentuale di decolorazione (DEC), variazione di COD e

2) Isolamento di nuovi ge ni codificanti laccasi da P. ostreatus   
La mancata disponibilità della sequenza completa del genoma di P. ostreatus  non 
esclude che la famiglia genica delle lacca si di questo fungo comprenda ancora altri 
membri non ancora caratterizzati. Da qui l’in teresse verso la ricerca di nuove laccasi 
da P. ostreatus , finalizzato non solo ad approfondi re la caratterizzazione di questa 
complessa famiglia enzimatica, ma anche ad ampliare la gamma di biocatalizzatori 
enzimatici da applicare ai proc essi di biorisanamento. 
Il punto di partenza di questa analisi è costituito dall’isolamento, mediante screening  
di una genoteca genomica in cloni BAC, di  un clone (I24) contenente tutti i geni 
codificanti le laccasi note da P. ostreatus . La co-localizzazione dei geni poxc , pox1 , 
poxa3 , poxa1b  nella regione di 150kb contenuta nel  clone I24, suggerisce che i 
membri di questa famiglia genica siano organizzati in cluster , supportando l’ipotesi 
che altri geni codificanti laccasi siano potenz ialmente presenti nello stesso inserto 
genomico. Il clone I24 è stato quindi oggetto  di ulteriori indagini finalizzate a 
confermare tale ipotesi. Due approcci sono stati applicati in parallelo: i) l’analisi per 
PCR condotta utilizzando oligonucleotid i degeneri, costruiti sulla sequenza 
aminoacidica conservata dei siti di le game al rame delle laccasi, ha condotto 
all’isolamento di un nuovo putativ o gene codificante laccasi, denominato pox4 ; ii) lo 
screening di una sub-genoteca pl asmidica del clone I24, mediante ibridazione con 
sonde corrispondenti ai cDNA delle laccasi note da P. ostreatus , ha portato invece 
all’isolamento di due nuovi putativi geni, pox3  e pox5 .     7All’analisi in silico dei tre nuovi geni isolati, ha fatto seguito la ricerca in vivo  dei 
trascritti corrispondenti. Esperimenti di RT-P CR sono stati condotti su campioni di 
RNA estratti dal fungo in diverse condizioni di crescita. Trascritti  maturi, codificanti 
enzimi con putativa attività laccasica, sono st ati isolati, nelle condizioni analizzate, 
per i geni pox3 e pox4  ma non per pox5 . L’analisi delle sequenze aminoacidiche 
dedotte dai trascritti isolati ha rivelato, per entrambe le protei ne, un alto grado di 
similarità con le laccasi note depositate in  banca dati, oltre che la conservazione, 
nella struttura primaria, di tutte le regioni consensus  delle laccasi. 
Per la caratterizzazione delle nuove putativ e laccasi POX3 e POX4 -mai isolate in 
forma nativa dal fungo delle condizioni analizzate- è st ata scelta la strategia 
dell’espressione eterologa. Si è proceduto quindi  all’espressione et erologa di POX3 e POX4 nei lieviti S. 
cerevisiae  e K. lactis , scelta dettata dalla nece ssità di modificare post-
traduzionalmente le laccasi ri combinanti. Per entrambe le proteine, ed in entrambi i 
lieviti, la localizzazione nel mezzo extrace llulare è garantita dall’ utilizzo del peptide 
segnale omologo alle laccasi, la cui efficacia è stata già verificata  nel dirigere la 
secrezione di altre laccasi da P. ostreatus espresse negli stessi ospiti. 
In entrambi gli ospiti non è stata rivelata attività fenolo-ossidasica per rPOX4. I livelli 
di espressione di questa proteina,  rivelabili mediante analisi per western blotting,   
risultano inoltre molto scarsi in entrambi i si stemi analizzati. E’ ipotizzabile che la 
proteina rPOX4 sia espressa in forma inattiva, per effetto di uno scorretto 
processamento o folding  da parte dell’ospite; in alter nativa, rPOX4 potrebbe essere 
caratterizzata da un’attività specifica molt o bassa o essere prodotta a livelli troppo 
scarsi per poter essere rivelata dalla s ensibilità del saggio spettrofotometrico. 
La proteina rPOX3 risulta invece prodotta in forma attiva in entrambi gli ospiti. La 
successiva caratterizzazione di rPOX3 è stat a condotta sulla proteina ricombinante 
prodotta in S. cerevisiae , dati i maggiori livelli di produz ione ottenuti in quest’ospite 
rispetto a K. lactis . La produzione di rPOX3 è stata ottimizzata agendo su parametri 
quali: la concentrazione di rame (induttore tr ascrizionale e cofattore delle laccasi), il 
tempo di aggiunta dell’induttore, e la temperat ura di crescita. In tutte le condizioni 
analizzate, la curva di produzione di rPOX 3 mostra un peculiare  andamento: la 
proteina si accumula nel mezzo di coltura nelle prime fasi della  crescita cellulare 
esibendo un picco massimo di attività (75 IU/L) al secondo giorno, per poi diminuire 
rapidamente a tempi successivi (l’attività è ri dotta a zero entro le successive 24 ore). 
Misure di attività condotte sui sovranatant i delle colture, raccolti in corrispondenza 
del picco massimo di attività, indicano c he essa diminuisce del 60% dopo solo un’ora 
di incubazione a temperat ura ambiente. Pur non potendo escludere completamente 
l’azione di proteasi extracellulari sulla proteina ricombinante, il comportamento 
osservato è in larga misura attribuibile all’e levata instabilità della  proteina rPOX3, dal 
momento che la stabilità della  stessa può essere increment ata in seguito all’aggiunta 
di agenti stabilizzanti. In par ticolare, l’aggiunta di solfat o di rame ai sovranatanti di 
colture di S. cerevisiae  esprimenti la laccasi rPOX3, causa un incremento dell’attività 
laccasica, in misura proporzionale alla s ua concentrazione. L’aggiunta del cofattore 
esercita, inoltre, un effetto stabilizzante su ll’enzima. L’instabilità di rPOX3 potrebbe 
essere quindi relazionata alla perdita del rame e alla conseguente formazione di una 
apo-laccasi riconvertibile in olo-enzima a ttivo in seguito all’aggiunta di rame. 
L’enzima rPOX3 è stato infine parzi almente purificato e caratterizzato, 
determinandone le costanti di affinità verso due diversi substrati, l’ABTS e il DMP. Il 
confronto dei valori delle K M determinati per rPOX3 con quelli già noti per l’enzima 
rPOXA1b (62% di identità con POX3) espr esso nello stesso ospite, indica una  8minore affinità di rPOX3 ne i confronti di entrambi i substrati. Una possibile 
spiegazione ai dati ottenuti può derivare dal confronto del modello tridimensionale di 
POX3 con quello di POXA1b. L’accesso del substrato alla tasca di legame 
dell’enzima POX3 appare infatti ostacolato dalla presenza di un loop più lungo 
rispetto a POXA1b. Ciò si tr adurrebbe in un aumento della co stante di affinità per il 
substrato, con un effetto par ticolarmente evidente verso substrati stericamente più 
ingombranti come l’ABTS. 
 
 
   
 
  
 
  
 
   
 
  
 
  
 
    
  
 
   
 
  
 
 
Introduction 
 
   
 
  
 
  
 
   
 
    91. Biotechnology and bioremediation:  a new challenge for wastewater 
treatment  
Water is a rare and precious commodity, and on ly an infinitesimal part of the earth’s 
water reserves (approximately 0.03%) consti tutes the resource available for human 
activities [1]. Besides the problem of  water shortage, t he huge amount of 
wastewaters discharged in the environment by the ever-growing industrial activities 
of the last century, has ri sen serious environmental conc erns about water pollution. 
In light of this, the recycle of properly tr eated industrial effluents at the “end of pipe” 
would be extremely desired. 
The increasingly stringent environmental regulations on hazardous wastes have 
encouraged the search for innovative solutions  for the remediation of contaminated 
wastewaters. In this field, bioremediation is seen as an attractive solution due to its 
reputation as a low cost, environmentally fr iendly and publicly acceptable treatment 
technology. The term “bioremediation” has been used to describe the process of using microbial 
or enzymatic processes to degrade or trans form hazardous organic contaminants.  
A large number of mi croorganisms have been isolated and applied to both in situ  and 
ex-situ  bioremediation processes in recent years, and the identi fication of new 
microbes with novel metabolic potential o ffers an attractive route to solve 
environmental problems [2]. Newly developed biotechnological tools can be applied to the analysis of biological 
processes in the environment, provid ing new approaches for understanding, 
managing, and restoring polluted sites. On the other hand, advances in genetic and 
protein engineering techniqu es have opened up new av enues towards the design of 
genetically engineered micr oorganisms (GEMs) and enzymes with the desired 
biodegradation properties [3]. The relative cheapness of the processes, the wide degradation potential offered by 
the different class of mi croorganisms which can be employed in, and the new 
frontiers opened by genetic en gineering, render bioremedi ation one of the most 
promising alternatives fo r wastewater treatment. 
 
2. Dye-containing effluents  
Synthetic dyes
 
Dyes have been used since ancient times, when they were extracted by natural 
sources (plants, lichens, insects or mussels ). The introduction of synthetic dyes is 
attributed to William Henry Perk in in 1856. In an attempt to synthesize an antimalarial 
drug, he accidentally discovered the world’s first commercially successful synthetic 
dye, the Mauveine, marking the origin of  the organic chemical industry of dyes. 
With the increased knowledge of chemical organic reacti ons, newly synthetic dyes 
with improved quality and char acteristics have been developed. As a consequence, 
50 years after Perkin’s discovery, more or less 90% of dyes on the market are of 
synthetic origins. Dyes are generally aromatic organic compounds  with complex structures. They are 
composed of a group of  atoms responsible for the dy e colour, called chromophores, 
as well as an electron withdrawing or don ating substituent that influences the colour 
of the chromophores, called auxochrome. T he most important chromophores are azo 
(–N≡N–), carbonyl (–C=O), nitro (–NO
2) and quinoid groups. T he most important 
auxochromes are amine (–NH 3), carboxyl (–COOH), sulfonate (–SO 3H) and hydroxyl 
(–OH).   10Dyestuff can be classified according to, chem ical structures, physical properties and 
characteristics related to the application proc ess (e.g., inks, disperse, pigments or vat 
dyes) [4] but they are generally divided in to anionic (including direct, acid and 
reactive dyes), cationic (basic dyes) and non-ionic (disperse dyes). The chromophores differ between these classes: anionic and non-ionic dyes are mostly 
azo- or anthraquinone groups, whilst reac tive dyes are typically azo-based 
chromophores combined with different  types of reactive groups.  
The chemical classes of dyes most frequent ly used on industrial  scale are the azo 
derivatives. Azo dyes are characterized by  the presence of one or more azo linkages 
and aromatic rings with simple applicat ion-technique requirements and high water-
fastness. Also reactive dyes are ext ensively used because of their favourable 
characteristics of bright colour and low energy consumption during application [5]. 
 
Textile effluents
 
More than 70.000 tons of synthetic dy es are annually pr oduced and applied in 
several industrial activities, up to 40% of which is lost during the dyeing processes. 
The textile industry, in particu lar, accounts for two-thirds of the total dyestuff market. 
It consumes large volumes of water (up to 150 L of water are required for the 
processing of 1 Kg of  dyed fabrics) and generates  huge amount of coloured 
wastewaters. Depending upon customer orders, types of manufactured textile 
materials and production schedules, textile wastewaters display a great chemical 
complexity and variability in terms of quantities and pollution load, type of dyes, pH, 
and temperature [6]. Most of dyes used in the textile industry are very recalcitrant to traditional treatment, 
since they are designed to resist fadi ng upon exposure to sweat, light, water 
chemicals including oxidizing agents, and microbial attack. Besides dyes, these 
effluents contain a complex mixture of many polluting substances, such as heavy 
metals associated with dyes or required for the dyeing process, additives, detergent 
and surfactants which have an adverse im pact in terms of amount of suspended 
solids and COD value of col oured effluents. All these fact ors render the wastewaters 
from textile industries one of t he most difficult  to treat [7]. 
The release of coloured wastewaters in th e ecosystem is a remarkable source of 
aesthetic pollution, eutrophication and per turbation of aquatic life. Moreover, 
synthetic dyes are toxic, carcinogenic and  mutagenic to various organisms, being 
detrimental to human health [8]. In particula r, azo e nitro compounds are reduced in 
sediments of aquatic bodies, yielding carc inogenic amines that spread in the 
ecosystem [9]. These concerns have led to new and/or st ricter regulations concerning coloured 
wastewater discharges, compelling the dye manufacturers and users to adopt 
“cleaner technology” approaches, for instanc e, the development of new lines of 
ecologically safe dyeing auxiliaries and the improvement of exhaust ion of dyes on to 
fibre [10]. Nevertheless, the treatment of  the large quantities of dyed wastes that are continually 
being produced, represents t he major problem currently experienced by the textile 
industry.  
3. Textile Wastewater treatmen t: which are the new frontiers?  
Various methods for textile wastewater treatment have been pr oposed, falling into 
three categories: physical, chemical and bi ological. Although successfully applied in 
small scale decolourisat ion processes, physic-chemical  methods are largely limited  11by their high cost, restricted versatility, in terference by other wastewater constituents 
and the handling of the waste generated ( Table 1 ).  
 
 Conversely, biological options (biorem ediation) have emerged as environmental 
friendly and cost-competitive alternatives. Bioremediation can be achieved using two 
different principles: bios orption and biodegradation  
 
Biosorption 
 
Adsorption based methods produce high- quality treated effluents, as they are 
effective on different types of dyes and prov ide high and rapid de colourisation. Most 
commercial systems currently use activat ed carbon as adsorbent because of its 
excellent adsorption ability. However its in dustrial application is restricted because of 
the high cost, the ineffectiveness against di sperse and vat dyes and the problem of 
its regeneration which is expensive and results in loss of the adsorbent.  
These factors have driven the research inte rest toward the use of non-conventional 
low cost adsorbents. Differ ent waste products from i ndustrial and agricultural 
operations, have been tested for dye removal [ 11]. Despite of their cheapness, these 
wastes have generally low adsorption capacity , thus are required to be used in large 
amounts, rising further disposal problems.  Alternatively, the use of mi crobial biomass (in dead or li ving form) has emerged as a 
promising and cost-effective technology. Although a wide variet y of microorganisms 
including algae, yeasts, bacteria and fungi have successfully been used in 
biosorption, most of the studies have prompted out th e advantages linked with the 
use of living or died fungi as dye absorbers [12]. Fungal  biomasses can be produced 
using relatively simple fermentation te chniques and inexpensive growth media; 
alternatively they are available as by-produc ts of industrial fermentation, representing 
a potential source of cheap adsorbent mate rials [13]. The use of dead fungal 
biomasses, is particularly advantageous since they are not affected by toxic wastes, 
do not pollute the environment releasing toxins and/or propagules  and do not require 
a continuous supply of nutrients. Moreov er, their adsorption capacity can be 
increased by certain physical or chemical pre-treatments like drying, autoclaving, use 
of organic or inorganic chemicals, which da mage the cell surface, bringing to the 
exposure of potential bind ing sites for dyes [13]. 
Mitosporic fungi and Zygomycetes such as Aspergillus  spp., Penicillium spp., 
Myrothecium  spp., Botrytis  spp., and Rhizopus  spp., are usually employed because 
Tab. 1 Advantages and disadvantages of the current methods of dye removal from industrial  
effluents (Robinson et al. 2001 )  12of their peculiar cell wall structure, wh ilst only few cases of biosorption employing 
basidiomycetes have been repor ted [12]. Fungal cell walls  consisting mainly of 
polysaccharides, proteins and lipids, offer m any functional groups for dye interaction, 
therefore colour removal can be the result of different me chanisms, such as physical 
(i.e. electrostatic or Van der Waal forces) or chemical binding (covalent and ionic). 
The adsorption process is hence influenced  by many factors including dye/sorbent 
interaction, dye concentration, sorbent su rface areas, particle size, temperature, pH 
and contact time [14]. In some cases, the external binding can be also followed by 
dye internalization [15]. Several authors al so reported the use of immobilized and 
inactivated fungal biomasses for dye remova l, highlighting the importance of proper 
definition of operational parameters, such as  flow rate, dye concentration and reactor 
configuration (aerated or rotating mode) for the succe ss of the process [16;17] 
 
Biodegradation  
Biodegradation can be accomplished by ei ther aerobic or anaerobic processes. 
Bacterial aerobic treatments ar e often ineffective in degradi ng dyes [18]. By contrast, 
bacteria are mostly applied as mixed microbi al consortia for azo-dye decolourisation 
under anaerobic conditions [19; 20]. Bacter ial cytoplasmic azo-reductases play an 
important role in this proce ss, however, their action results in the production of very 
toxic aromatic amines. Only a combinatio n of bacterial anaerob ic-aerobic treatments 
has proved successful for both decolourisat ion (provided by anaerobic treatment) 
and detoxification (by aerobic degradation of toxic compounds obtained by azo-dye 
cleavage) of textile wastewaters [21]. By far, the single class of microorganisms mo st efficient in brea king down synthetic 
dyes are the white-rot fungi (WRF) [4]. These constitute a diverse ecophysiological  group comprising mo stly basidiomycetes 
(and, to a lesser extent, litter-decomposing) fungi capable of extensive aerobic lignin 
depolymerization and mineralizat ion. This property is based on the WRF’s capacity to 
produce one or more extracel lular lignin-modifying enzymes (LMEs), which, thanks to 
their low substrate specif icity, are also capable of  degrading a wide range of 
xenobiotics, e.g. polycycl ic aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated phenols, 
polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, pestici des, explosives and synthetic dyes. In 
addition, the secretion of LMEs in the extrac ellular medium allows fungi to tolerate 
high concentration of toxic compounds and to  degrade very insoluble dyes as well as 
those which can’t enter the cell. Accordingl y, all these features  promote white-rot 
fungi as good candidates for wastewater treatment.  
4. White rot fungi and LMEs 
The complex pattern of LMEs produced by  white-rot fungi to accomplish lignin 
degradation comprises several oxidative acti vities, mainly Manganese peroxidases 
(MnP), Lignin-peroxidases (LiP), versatile peroxidases (VP) and Laccases, together 
with other enzymes (glucose oxidase, cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH), hydrolases) 
or factors (e.g. the reactive oxygen specie s (ROS)), which also play an important role 
in the process. LMEs are produced by white-rot fungi dur ing the secondary metabolism since lignin 
oxidation provides no net energy to the fungus. Synthesis and secretion of these 
enzymes are strictly influenced by nutri ent levels (often induced under C and N 
limitation), culture conditions (shaking or st ationary) and by the pr esence of different 
inducers (metals, aromatic compounds and so on). Frequently, more than one  13isoforms of LMEs are expressed by diffe rent taxa depending on culture conditions 
[22].  
Mn peroxidase 
 
Manganese peroxidases (MnP) are glycoprot eins with an iron protoporphyrin IX 
(heme) prosthetic group and molecular weig hts between 32 and 62.5 KDa. They are 
usually secreted in multiple isoforms in  carbon and nitrogen limited media by several 
fungi [23]. MnP catalyzes the per oxide dependent oxidation of Mn2+ to Mn3+  which is 
stabilized by chelators such as  oxalic acid [24], itself also excreted by the fungi. 
Chelated Mn3+ acts as a highly reactive ( up to 1510mV) low molecular weight 
diffusible redox-mediator. Thus, MnP ar e able to oxidase and  depolymerise their 
natural substrate, i.e., lignin as well as recalcitrant xenobiotics, such as 
nitroaminotoluene and textile dyes [25]. In vitro  depolymerization c an be enhanced in 
the presence of co-oxidants such as thiols or unsaturated fatty acids (Tween 80) [26]. 
 
Lignin peroxidase  
Lignin peroxidases are N-glycosylated enz ymes with molecular masses between 38 
and 47 KDa, which catalyzes the oxidation of non-phenolic aromatic lignin moieties 
and similar compounds by one-electron abstracti on to form reactive radicals. They 
contain heme in the active site and show a classical peroxidase mechanism. The role 
of LiP in ligninolysis could be the further transformation of lignin fragments which are 
initially released by MnP. LiP are not essent ial for the attack on lignin: several highly 
active WRF and litter-decaying fungi do not produce this enzyme. Lip have been used to mineralize a variety of  recalcitrant aromatic compounds, such 
as PAHs [27], polychlorinated biphenyls [28], and also dyes [29]. Usually, the natural 
fungal secondary metabolite veratryl alcohol ( VA) acts as redox m ediator to stimulate 
the LiP catalyzed oxidation of a wide r ange of recalcitrant substrates [30]. 
 
Laccase
 
Laccases are multicopper-containing enzym es belonging to the group of blue 
oxidases, catalyzing the one-electron ox idation of a wide range of aromatic 
substrates such as a variety of phenolic compounds, as well as diamine and aromatic 
amines with the concomitant redu ction of oxygen to water.  
A more detailed description of this class of  enzyme is given in the following sections. 
 
Versatile peroxidase  
Versatile peroxidases (VP) are heme contai ning enzymes, structural hybrid between 
MnPs and LiPs, since they can oxidize not only Mn2+ but also phenolic and non-
phenolic aromatic compounds including dy es, in manganese-independent reactions 
[31]. VPs have been recently described in Pleurotus  and Bjerkandera  [32; 33]. 
Decolourisation of some te xtile dyes by VPs from B. adusta  has been reported only 
in the presence of oxid izing mediators [34]. 
 
Auxiliary activities  
Many other enzymes produced by fungi are involved in lignin degradation. Several 
extracellular oxidases (gluco se, glyoxal, galact ose and aryl alcohol oxidases) have 
been shown to play an important  role in the lignin degr ading process since they 
provide H 2O2, an essential cofactor for peroxi dases. The involvement of other 
enzymatic activities, such as cellobios e dehydrogenase (CDH) and haloperoxidases  14in lignin breakdown has al so been proposed, although their role is not yet full 
understood [35].  
Small molecular mediators
 
Given the random polymer natur e of lignin and the bulk of LME, direct and specific 
interactions between lignin (or recalcitrant  structural analogs) and LME are highly 
improbable. Rather low-molecular weight and diffusible redox mediators are able to 
migrate into the lignocellulose  complex, providing high redox potential (>900mV) to 
degrade lignin. They can be involved in the LME-catalyzed generation of reactive 
radical moieties from a variet y of lignin-like substrates, but also in the formation of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) which either di rectly or indirectly could attack lignin or 
xenobiotic molecules [36]. Both native and synthetic mediators have been found to promote LMEs activities. 
Some organic acids, excreted by  several fungi may act as Mn
+3 chelators stabilizing 
the metal. Veratryl alcohol (VA), a secondar y metabolite of several WRF [37], after its 
oxidation to the VA cation radical by LiP, also acts as a mediator for the degradation 
of lignin. Nevertheless, LiP is stimulat ed by VA probably by protecting the enzyme 
against the damaging effect of H 2O2 [38]. 
Laccase mediators, ranging from natural (3 -HAA) [39], to synthetic ones, have also 
found several industrial applications since they are able to ex pand the substrate 
range of laccases to non-phenolic substrates [40]. 
 
5. Decolourisation of t extile dyes and effluents by WRF and their enzymes 
White-rot fungi have shown to  have an outstanding potentia l for the bioremediation of 
industrial coloured wastewater s. Thanks to their non-specif ic LMEs these fungi are 
able to transform a wide r ange of organic compounds [4]. 
Most previous studies have focused on few “standard” organisms, i.e. P. 
chrysosporium and T. versicolor . More recently, there has been a growing interest in 
exploring the decolourisation potential of  a wide array of f ungi, ranging from 
basidiomycetes to ascomycetes and mito sporic fungi. Experimental evidence 
indicated that the biodegradat ion capability of fungal species is very heterogeneous, 
mainly due to the physiological differenc es among them and to the variable pattern 
and expression of their LMEs in the presenc e of chemically different compounds. 
This heterogeneity has been exploited for the sele ction of fungi with high 
biodegrading capabilities  [41; 42] and could turn out to be particularly valuable to 
meet the variability of textile wastewaters.  
 
The decolourisation of dye- bearing wastewaters may be achieved using either 
microorganisms or enzymes as biocatalysts.  Together with the constraints posed by 
specific bioprocesses, some distinctiv e advantages and drawbacks characterize the 
use of each of these two biosystems.  
Whole-cell based processes
  
Some reports suggest the superiority of using whole cells against purified enzyme 
based processes. Romero and co-workers [43]  reported that the lower percentage of 
decolourisation obtained with laccases, with respect to the in vivo  process catalysed 
by T. versicolor whole cell, could be ascribed to product inhibition of the enzyme. 
This inhibition is avoided using the whol e fungus, since degradation products can be 
further metabolized. Furthermore, in many ca ses, the concerted action of different 
enzymatic systems, extracellular, wall asso ciated or intracellula r (cytochrome P-450  15monooxygenase) [44], is necessary to achiev e both efficient dye removal and toxicity 
reduction of treated wastew aters. Moreover, the cells may synthesize several 
cofactors required to maintain the enzyme activity and to promote dye 
decolourisation, such as veratryl al cohol [45] or hy drogen peroxide [46]. 
Few studies addressed the q uestion whether fungal dye decolourisation causes 
effective dye mineralization. Mineralizatio n rates of 23.1-48.3% for a wide range of 
14C-ring labelled azo dyes after a 12-day incubation with P. chrysosporium  have been 
recorded [47]. However the role played by the substitution pattern on dye 
mineralization rates is a matter of contro versy [48], though it is clear that dye 
decolourisation is not equival ent to dye mineralization. 
Although some studies have been conducted on testing the toxicity  of the treated 
effluent/dye solution [49], with also report ed examples of effect ive detoxification, 
further detailed characterization of t he intermediates and metabolites produced 
during biodegradation is stil l required to ensure the sa fety of the decolourized 
wastewaters.   Beside the contribution of all the activi ties associated with fungal growth and  dye 
decolourisation, whole cell based treatment s exhibited two additi onal advantages: the 
relative easiness and cheapness of up- stream processes required to make 
biocatalytic activity available compared with enzymatic processe s, and the possibility 
to exploit microbial consortia for the conc urrent removal of different toxic compounds 
[50].  
Factors affecting whole cell based processes
 
The decolourisation ability of WRF can be substantially increased by carefully 
optimizing the operational param eters, such as initial dye concentration, nutrient 
content of the media, and culture conditions  (stationary or shaking). [51; 52].  
Studies on the effect of type (inorganic or  organic) and concentration of nitrogen 
sources on dye-treatment, were carried out by many authors [53;54;55;56]. For most 
of the fungi the highest decolourisation rate  was reached under ni trogen limitation. In 
addition, in some cases, the choice of t he proper N-source was shown to be crucial 
to achieve colour removal [57]. Several reports investigated various carbon  sources as effective substrate for dye-
decolourisation process, showing that the e fficiency of colour removal by different 
fungal species, may be strictly dependent on the type of C-source. 
Addition of glucose as carbon source  caused a dramatic improvement in dye-
treatment catalysed by several fungi [58]; glucose concentration was also shown to 
finely affect the decolourisa tion rate [57]. Various cheaper carbon sources have been 
applied in decolourisation processes to r eplace glucose (e.g. starch, molasses), 
showing different results depending on the fungal species [59]. The amount and the type of carbon and nitrogen sources affect dye decolourisation 
by altering the enzymatic pattern produced  by the fungi. Beside the level of LME 
production, the choice of nutrients especially  affects the patterns of LME expression 
in each fungal species. Thus, judicious m anipulation of the culture conditions may 
allow the production and select ion of different mixtures  of ligninolytic enzymes, 
exhibiting selective decolouri sation abilities toward specific classes of dyes or 
effluents [53;55]. Enhanced LME production in th e presence of industrial effluents turns out to be an 
additional advantage during bi oremediation processes. For example, during the 
treatment of a dye-cont aining textile effluents by the white-rot fungus Clitocybula  16dusenii , both MnP and laccase activities we re induced [25]. In another study, 
D’Souza and co-workers reported a seven fold enhancement of laccase production 
during the treatment of coloured effl uents by a marine fungal isolate [60]. 
The efficiency of fungal strains in dye re moval is also affected by the choice of 
shaking or stationary conditions. Higher  colour removal has been observed in 
shaking cultures as compared to the stat ionary cultures, because of better oxygen 
transfer and nutrient distribution [61].  Although numerous WRF strains have been successfully used for decolourisation of 
several synthetic dyes, their application for dye wastewater treatm ent is still hindered 
by the complex and variable com position of real effluents. 
The harsh conditions provided by the wastewaters (extre me pH values, high salt 
concentration, presence of chelating agent s, precursors, by-products, surfactants 
and very complex dye composition) can affe ct fungal growth, extending the time of 
treatment, or inhibiti ng the process.  
As reported by Abadulla [62], Cu and Fe chelators as well as anionic detergents, 
sometimes found in real textile industrial effluents, inhibited Polyporus sp . and 
Trametes villosa  up to 20%.  In another report, some  fungal species, at first selected 
for their decolourisation ability on Reactive Black 5, were effective on a real waste 
only if the dye-bath was diluted, in order to allow fungal growth [63].  
The fungal growth, enzyme production and s ubsequent dye decolourisation are also 
affected by pH  value. The optimum pH for dye decolourisation lies in the acidic range 
for the majority of tested fungi [54;64]. In  contrast, neutral and more basic pH values 
characterize real textile effluents, renderi ng their treatment even more troublesome.  
The effect of heavy metals on dye decolourisat ion has also to be taken into account, 
since they form organo-metal complexes in  many dye molecules and, consequently, 
are present in discrete amount in textile effluents. Their e ffect has been investigated 
by many authors [65;66]. In an exemplific ative case, Hatvani and Mecs [67] studied 
the effect of different metals on decolourisation of Poly R-478 by Lentinula edodes . 
They observed that, all the metals caused an increase in laccase and MnP 
production, when added at very low am ount. However, over a metal-dependent 
threshold concentration, their addition produced an inhibitory effect on decolourisation.   In view of the application of whole cell based processes to  real wastewater treatment, 
the evaluation of the performances of the f ungal systems in non-ster ile conditions is 
also an important factor to be considered. Libra et al [68] addressed this issue 
proposing several strategies to improve the use of T. versicolor  for RB5 
decolourisation under non-steril e conditions. They found t hat an effective process 
could be realized by producing fungal in ocula in conditions which gave them a 
selective advantage over bacteria (nitrogen limitation in the medi um, cultivation on 
organic solids). Considering all the above fact ors, the selection of fungal species able to cope with 
unfavourable characteristics of process effluents repres ents a possible and feasible 
solution. Junghanss et al [69] for example,  reported that aquatic fungi selected for 
their good decolourisation ability towards seve ral classes of dyes, may better fit the 
high content of inorganic ions found in industrial dye-containing effluents. 
 
Beside the choice of the fungal strain, the decolourisation of real effluents requires 
the appropriate design of reacto r configuration. There are few reports specifically on  17dye decolourisation by fungal whole-cells in  continuous bioreactors [57;70]. Their 
application is still lacking because of the problems encountered with this operation: 
the short fungal lifetime due to  the limitation of nutrient s and oxygen required for 
growth and LME production; the excessive  growth of the fungus with hyphae 
extension, which prevent adequate oxy genation of the medi um and decrease the 
efficiency of mass transfer. Several reactor configurations have been  proposed to overcome these limitations. 
Mielgo and co-workers [71] set up a pulsed bed bioreactor with immobilized P. 
chrysosporium ; Hai and coworkers [72] proposed an efficient system based on fungi 
immobilized in a membrane-bioreactor; severa l authors [73;74] invest igated the effect 
of different types of discs for fungal immobili zation to allow intermittent contact of the 
mycelium with the effluent, thus avoiding overgrowth.   
Enzyme based processes 
 
The application of enzyme-based processe s would allow a greater independence 
from the influences of wastewater comp osition which may affect fungal growth. 
Moreover, by decoupling the proc ess of fungal growth from wastewater treatment, it’s 
possible to overcome some of the problems related with whole cell based processes, 
such as the disposal of spent biomass and the need for sterile conditions.  The involvement of LMEs in the dye decolourisatio n process by WRF has been 
confirmed in several independent studies us ing purified enzymes or WRF cell-free 
culture supernatants. Sometimes it’s diffi cult to find a correlation between dye 
decolourisation and the activity of a specif ic class of LME (MnP, LiP or Lac). Non-
optimum conditions of enzyme assays [75 ], poor enzyme diffusion in the medium 
[76], simultaneous presence of isoforms with different affinity for both dyes and reaction substrates during me asurement, or rapid inactiva tion of the enzymes by 
proteolytic degradation [77] c an affect this analysis.  
In vitro  decolourisation using purified LME was widely described, e.g., using Lac from 
Pyricularia oryzae  [78], P. ostreatus  [79], T. versicolor  [4] Pycnoporus cinnabarinus  
[80], LiP from P. chrysosporium  [81], T.versicolor  [30], and MnP from B. adusta [81], 
P. chrysosporium  [82], T. versicolor  [83]. 
However, the exploitation of different  enzymatic mixtures produced by each 
ligninolytic strain appears to be of most in terest for practical applications. Several 
authors opted for the use of cru de culture filtrates in dye- treatment, since they offer 
some distinct advantages: i) their use allo ws to skip some expensive purification 
steps; ii) other factors pres ent in the medium may stabilize the main oxidative 
enzymes or act in a synergistic way with them [46]. Moreover, laccase and peroxidases may act as starters of a chai n reaction by generating highly active free 
radicals which in turn, play ing a mediating role, promot e the decomposition of those 
dyes which are not the subs trate of LME per se [84]. 
 For the application of fungal enzymatic system s to large scale wastewater treatment, 
two aims have to be pursued: optimization  of their production and improvement of 
their performances. Reducing the costs of LME production by optimising the 
fermentation parameters is the basic research for industrial  applications. On the other 
hand, new tools to achieve these tasks have being developed:   
Enzyme immobilization
 
An increase of enzyme-based process thr oughput, could be achieved by means of 
enzyme immobilization. Immob ilization of enzymes to water-insoluble supports has  18shown to increase their operational stability [85]. Furthermore, enzyme 
immobilization would allow t he reuse of the enzyme and thus decrease the cost of 
industrial applications. For these reasons, it s application to wastew ater treatment has 
gained much interest and various examples  have recently been reviewed [86]. Many 
efforts have being focused on finding che ap and reliable confinement methods in 
order to realize suitable biosystems for wa stewater treatment with a reduced effect 
on the overall cost of the processes.   
Use of small mediators
 
The activities of the LMEs can be further  increased by the addition of different low 
molecular mass mediators. Most of the work  in this field has been done on laccases, 
since their lower redox potential (0.5-0.8 V) compared to those of ligninolytic 
peroxidases (>1.0V) only allows the di rect degradation of lo w redox-potential 
compounds. From the description of the fi rst laccase mediator, ABTS [87], to the 
more recent use of the -NOH-type,  synthetic mediators such as 1-
hydroxybenzotriazolr, violuric acid and N-hydroxyacetanilide or TEMPO, a large 
number of studies have been performed on t he mechanisms of their action [88; 89] 
and on their application to  dye decolourisation. 
However, a systematic effort  has been conducted to evaluat e the potential of several 
naturally occurring compounds to mediate the oxidative reactions catalysed by 
laccases with the aim of identifying c heaper, more efficient and eco-friendly 
mediators for the decolourisation of recalcitrant dyes [90]. 
Moreover, MnP mediated decolouri sation of some azo dyes by P. chrysosporium  has 
proved to be enhanced by the addition of Tween 80 [91]. Whereas, LiP produced by 
T. versicolor  is able to decolourise RBBR in the presence as well as in the absence 
of VA [30].  
Heterologous expression
 
Recombinant expression of oxidative enz ymes in suitable hosts represents a 
promising tool to obtain higher production yi elds at and affordable price. Efficient 
expression systems of LME have been  proposed [52]. Laccases have been 
expressed at high yields in many hosts , whilst the heterologous expression of 
peroxidases seems to be critical due to the more complex post-translational 
modifications required for co rrect folding and activity  of these enzymes [92]. 
In addition, molecular biology tools have been applied to improv e the performances 
of oxidative enzymes. Laccases have been subjected to both rational design and 
directed evolution and enzymes endow ed with improved properties (extended 
substrate range, catalytic properties and stability) have been produced as “new” 
enzymatic system more suitable to the un natural conditions pr ovided by industrial 
effluents [93]. Thus, the isolation of new genes, the char acterisation of their products and further 
engineering of LMEs fo r their improvement, are the area of potential future research.  
 
6. Oxidative enzymes for wastewat er treatment: the case of laccases 
Laccase was first isolat ed in the exudates of Rhus vernicifera , the Japanese Lacquer 
tree by Yoshida in 1883. A few years late r its presence was also demonstrated in 
fungi [94]. More recently, findings of laccase  activity in prokaryotes [95] and insects 
[96] have also been reported.  Although known for a long time, laccases attr acted considerable attention only after 
the beginning of studies on enzymatic degradation of wood by white-rot fungi and  19now, fungal laccases are being  extensively exploited for many industrial purposes. 
Laccases, EC 1.10.3.2, p-diphenol:dioxygen ox idoreductase, are part of a larger 
group of enzymes termed the multicopper enzymes, whic h includes, among others, 
ascorbic acid oxidase and ceruloplasmin. They catalyse the one-electr on oxidation of four substrat e equivalents, coupled to the 
four-electron reduction of O
2 to water. The catalysis carried out by all members of this 
family, is guaranteed by the presence of di fferent copper centres, classified on the 
basis of their spectroscopic properties: one type-1 (T1) copper, one type-2 (T2) and 
two type-3 (T3) copper ions. 
Two histidines and one cysteine serve as ligands for type-1 Cu at the T1 center. 
While usually in type-1 centers, a sulfur from a methionine functions as an additional 
axial ligand, the fourth ligand for this copper center is not present in fungal laccases, 
in which un uncoordinating Phe or Leu occupies this position [97]. Type 1 copper confers the typical blue col our to laccases, whic h results from the 
intense electronic absorption at 600nm c aused by the covalent copper-cysteine 
bond. Due to its high redox potential of 500-800mV, Type 1 copper is  the site where 
substrate oxidation takes place. Type 2 site is 
characterized by the lack of strong absorption features in the visible region and reveals usual 
EPR spectra. It is strategically positioned close to the Type 3 copper, a binuclear center, spettroscopically characterized by an electron adsorption at 330nm (oxidized form). Type 2 and Type 3 copper ions form a trinuclear cluster, where reduction of molecular oxygen and release of water takes place (Fig.1). Type 2 copper is coordinated by two histidines and 
Type 3 copper atoms by six histidines. The two 
copper ions of the T3 site are EPR-silent due to an antiferromagnetic coupling mediated by a 
bridging hydroxyl ligand. Substrates (phenols and ar omatic or aliphatic 
amines) are oxidized by the T1 copper to produce radicals that c an then produce dimers, oligomers and polymers. The 
extracted electrons are transferred, pr obably through a strongl y conserved His-Cys-
His tripeptide motif, to the T2/T3 site, w here molecular oxygen is  reduced to water 
[98]. Despite the amount of information on laccas es as well as on other blue multicopper 
oxidases, neither the precise electron transfer pathway nor  the details of dioxygen 
reduction in blue multicopper oxidas es are fully understood [99].  
Kinetic data suggest a mechanism of reac tion “two site ping-pong bi bi” type; 
according to this mechanism the products  are released before a new substrate 
molecule is ligated [100].
 
Most fungi produce several isoforms of laccases. The molecular basis for the 
production of different isoenzymes is the pr esence of multiple laccase genes. Indeed, 
several laccase gene families have been described [101;102]. Gene families probably produce closely related proteins that are subtly different in their activities, 
allowing the transformation of  a wider range of substrates  or showing differential 
regulation [103]. Fig.1 Catalytic cycle of laccases 
 20The majority of white-rot fungi are sh own to produce both intracellular and 
extracellular laccases, but the enzyme is mostly (95%) located outside the cell. The 
localization of laccases seems to be asso ciated with their physiological functions. 
Extracellular laccases are mainly involved in lignin transformation but they are also 
reported to be important virulence factors in many fungal diseases by protecting 
fungal pathogens from toxic phy toalexins and tannins [104]. 
Intracellular fungal laccases can be involved in transformation of low-molecular-weight phenolic compounds prod uced in the cell, whilst laccases located in the cell 
walls and spores can be involved in synthes is of melanin and other substances 
protecting the cell walls. 
 
Structural properties
 
The molecular properties of laccase and the nature of its copper-containing active 
sites have been studied extensively by bioc hemical and spectroscopic methods over 
the last 50 years. To the present, more  than a hundred laccases have been isolated 
and characterized. Based on t he literature, general charac teristics of these enzymes 
can be drawn out.  Typical fungal laccase is a monomeric protein of approximately 60–70 kDa with an 
acidic isoelectric point around pH 4.0 ( Tab.2 ). It seems that ther e is considerable 
heterogeneity in the properties of laccases isolated from ascomycetes, especially 
with respect to molecular weight.  
Laccases are glycoproteins like many fungal extracellular enzymes; the carbohydrate 
moiety of the majority of laccases consis ts of mannose, N-acet ylglucosamine, and 
galactose and constitutes about 45% of the protein mass in laccases of plant origin 
and about 10-20% of fungal ones. Glycosylati on of fungal laccases is one of the main 
problems for their heterologous production. It was proposed that in addition to the 
structural role, glycosylation can also parti cipate in the protection of laccase from 
proteolysis and inactivation by free radicals [105]. Property n Median Q

upper quartile (Baldrian, 2006)  21
Although most of fungal la ccases are monomeric protei ns, some exceptions of 
homodimeric, heterodimeric and oligomer ic structures hav e been found [22].  
For a long time, attempts to crystallize la ccase for X-ray analysi s were unsuccessful 
despite considerable efforts in several labo ratories. The major pr oblem was attributed 
to the presence of carbohydrate chains and their heterogeneity. However, recently, 
several complete laccase structures from Coprinus cinereus  (in a copper type-2-
depleted form) [106], T. versicolor  [107;108], M. albomyces  [109;110], Bacillus 
subtilis  [111], Rigidoporus lignosus  [112], Pycnoporus cinnabarinus  [113], Cerrana 
maxima  [114], have been determined, the last four enzyme wit h a full complement of 
copper ions.  
The overall structure of T. versicolor  laccase consists of three consecutively 
connected cupredoxin-like domains twisted in a tight globule with dimensions of 
about 65 x 55 x 45 Å. Domain 1 comprises two four-stranded β-sheets and four 3 10-
helices. Three of the 3 10- helices are in connec ting peptides between the β-strands, 
and one is in a segment between domain 1 and 2. The second domain has one six-stranded and one five-stranded β-sheet, 
and like in domain 1, there are three 3
10-
helices in peptides connecting individual β-
strands and domains 1 and  3, respectively. 
A 3 10- helix between domains 2 and 3 
forms part of a 40-residue-long extended loop region. Finally, domain 3 consists of a β-barrel formed by two five-stranded β-
sheets and a two-stranded β-sheets that, 
together with a α-helix and a β-turn, form 
the cavity in which the type-1 copper is located. The trinuclear copper cluster (T2/T3) is embedded between domains 1 and 3 with both domains providing residues for the coordination of  the coppers. The 
third domain has the highest helical content 
with one 3
10-helix and two α-helices located in the connecting regions between the 
strands of the different β-sheets. Finally, at the C-terminal of domain 3, three 
sequentially arranged α-helices complete the fold. An α-helix formed by 13 residues 
at the C-terminal end is stabilized by a disulfide bridge to domain 1 (Cys-85–Cys- 
488), and a second disulfide bridge (Cys-117–C ys-205) connects domains 1 and 2. 
Both N-terminal and C-terminal amino ac ids benefit from hydrogen bonding networks 
to the rest of the protein.  
Multiple sequence alignments of fungal laccas es available in public databases have 
identified a distinctive sequenc e signature that distinguis hes fungal laccases from 
plant laccases and other mu lticopper oxidases. This signature consists of four 
ungapped sequence segments, L1 to L4, whic h contain the one cysteine and ten 
histidines residues serving as copper  ligands together wit h those residues 
responsible to maintain a local th ree dimensional fold [115] (Tab.3) 
The redox potential of the T1 site determines the effi ciency of catalysis, making 
laccases with high-potential T1 site promisin g tools for biotechno logy applications.  
A sum of structural feat ures, ranging form the direct ligands and coordination 
geometries of T1 site to the nature of t he second sphere residues, seem to affect the 
redox potentials among laccases. A detail ed structural compar ison between a low  Fig.2 Ribbon representation of Trametes 
versicolor laccase X-ray structure. 
Domain 1 is showed in red, domain 2 in green and domain 3 in bleu. Copper ions 
are show in vdW representation [107].  22 
redox potential (E 0) C. cinereus laccase and a high E 0 T. versicolor laccase showed 
that structural differences of the Cu1 coordination possibl y account for the different 
E0 values [108]. This was later confirmed by studies on R. lignosus laccase with a 
high redox potential [112]. However, more  effort will be needed to elucidate the 
relation between the structure of the catalytic site and t he substrate preference of 
different laccase enzymes. 
 
Industrial applications  
Owing to their high and non-specific oxidatio n capacities, to the lack of a requirement 
for cofactors and to the use of readily av ailable oxygen as an  electron acceptor, 
laccases are useful biocatalysts with so me established and lots of emerging 
biotechnological applications . In food industry, the se lective removal of phenol 
derivatives by laccases is exploited for stabi lization and improvement  of the quality of 
different drinks. In pulp and paper industries the treat ment of wood pulp with 
laccases, provides milder and cleaner strategies of delignification that are also 
respectful of the integrity of cellulose [116]. The use of laccase in the textile industry is growing very fast, since besides to decolourise textile effluents, laccases are being used to bleach te xtiles and even to 
synthesise dyes [117]. Related to textile bleaching, in 1996 Novozyme (Novo Nordisk, Denmark) launched a new industria l application of laccase enzyme in denim 
finishing: DeniLite
®, the first industrial laccase and the first bleaching enzyme acting 
with the help of a mediator. Moreover, amperometric biosensors based on laccases 
have been described for the analysis of different compounds (chloro-substituted 
phenols, catecholamines, lignin, tea tannins, and also ascorbic acid [118]). Laccases 
have also found applications in  biofuel cells, which could pr ovide power, for example, 
for small transmitter systems [119]. An emer ging field of applicati on is the synthetic

deprotection [120] and production of comp lex polymers and medical agents [121] 
Application of laccases in bioremediati on are widespread: lacca ses from different 
sources have shown to be able to degrade several xenobiotics, such as polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) [122], 2, 4,6-trinitrotoluene [123], chlorinated 
phenolics [124], pesticides [125] and synthetic  dyes. They have been successfully 
applied in Kraft pulp bleaching [126] or in detoxification of agricultural by-products 
[127] including olive mill wa stes and coffee pulp [128]. 
 7. Application of the white-rot fungi Pleurotus ostreatus  and Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium to dye decolourisation: state of art 
The white-rot fungus P. ostreatus belongs to a subclass of white-rot fungi that 
produces laccases, MnPs, but not LiP. Mult iple laccase genes encoding isoenzymes 
with interesting structural and  functional properties are ex pressed by this fungus. The 
production of each isoenzyme is differentially regulated by culture conditions. So far, 
five isoenzymes secreted by the myceliu m have been purified and characterized: 
POXC [129], POXA1w [130], POXA1b [131], and,  more recently, the two strictly 
related isoenzymes POXA 3a and POXA3b [132]. POXC  is the most abundantly 
produced in all growth conditions tested so far; POXA1w shows peculiar differences 
with regard to metal ions content, containi ng two zinc atoms, one iron atom, and only 
one copper atom per molecule ; POXA1b is the most stable at alkaline pH and shows 
activity inside the cell or on the cell wall [133]; POXA3a and POXA3b are 
heterodimeric laccases. Studies on laccase  encoding genes have also led to the 
identification of four different genes and of the corresponding cDNAs, poxc 
(previously named pox2 ) [134], pox1 (which codes for a laccase isoenzyme not 
identified yet) [135]), poxa1b  [136]  and poxa3 [132]. 
The expression of multiple isoforms of Manganese peroxidases was also reported in 
P. ostreatus . Three isoenzymes (Mnp1, MnP2 and MnP3) have been purified and 
characterized, whose level of production was shown to be improved in the presence 
of Mn
2+ during solid state fermentation [137]. 
Moreover, this fungus produces a veratryl al cohol oxidase that can participate in the 
lignin degradation process, either reduci ng the radical intermediates formed by 
laccase or MnP, thus preventing their repolymerization, or  producing hydrogen 
peroxide necessary for MnP action [138]. P. ostreatus was shown to be able to decolouris e a representative antraquinonic dye, 
RBBR, in solid and liquid cultur e and the key role played by laccases in this process 
has been demonstrated. As a fact, when purified enzymes, POXC and POXA3 were 
used in in vitro  decolourisation experiments, up to 70-80% colour removal was 
achieved in the absence of any redox mediat ors. Interestingly, these laccases differ 
significantly in their efficiency of decolouris ation of the tested dye, showing different 
catalytic efficiencies (K
cat/KM values) towards RBBR. Furt hermore, using a mixture of 
both POXC and POXA3 an improv ement in the reaction rate and in the final level of 
dye decolourisation were observed, s uggesting a concerted action of the two 
isoenzymes in the decolourisation process [79]. In addition, a crude laccase mixture from P. ostreatus  cultures was immobilized by 
entrapment in copper alginate beads and successfully employed in RBBR 
decolourisation both in batch and in a fi xed bed bioreactor. The system provided 
good decolourisation performances  together with a remarkably increase in stability of 
the immobilized laccases in comparison with the free enzyme preparation [139].  24P. chrysosporium is a white-rot fungus, able to  produce several classes of 
extracellular peroxidases, such as Manganese and Lignin peroxidases. Its 
decolourisation ability is we ll documented in scientific lit erature with also reported 
examples of dye mineralizat ion [47]. In one of the ea rliest studies, Glenn and Gold 
[140] showed that synthetic dy es were decolourised by this fungus and that inhibitors 
of ligninolytic activities also inhibited t he process of colour removal. In subsequent 
works, Manganese peroxidases  [141] or Lignin peroxidases [142], have been 
described as the main enzymes involved in  decolourisation by this fungus. A novel 
family of multicopper oxidases has also been described [101] but its involvement in 
decolourisation processes has never been demonstrated.  
 
8. Aim of the thesis 
White-rot fungi and their enzymes represent  promising tools fo r the treatment of 
industrial effluents due to their outstanding  abilities to degrade  a wide range of 
pollutants, including synthetic dyes.  In this context, research has been aimed at  exploiting WRF potenti al by developing 
new biosystems for the treatment of  industrial coloured wastewaters. 
Work description has been organis ed in the following sections: 
 1) Application of new biosystems for the treatment of industrial coloured 
wastewaters  
Different kinds of biosystems based on the white-rot fungi P. ostreatus  and P. 
chrysosporium  have been developed and tested fo r the biodegradation of model 
wastewaters from textile in dustry. Both whole-cell a nd enzyme-based (in free and 
immobilized form) processes have been explored.  Biosorption on fungal biomasses ( Mucorales  fungi) was also investigated as a 
parallel approach in collaboration with Univ ersity of Turin. 
The performances of the analysed biosystems have been evaluated and 
compared in terms of decolourisation ability, COD (Chemical oxygen demand) and toxicity reduction of the treated effluent. 
2) Isolation of new members of P. ostreatus  laccase family and their characterisation 
through heterologous expression:  
Taking into account the role played by lacc ase in the decolourisation process, the 
P. ostreatus  laccase family was investigated in  order to enrich the knowledge of 
this enzyme, thus improving their potent ial application to wastewater treatment. 
The assortment of P. ostreatus  laccases was enlarged up to seven members, by 
isolation, cloning and het erologous expression of new laccase genes.

Abstract The effect of Phanerochaete chrysosporium
andPleurotus ostreatus whole cells and their lignino-
lytic enzymes on models of colored industrial waste-
waters was evaluated. Models of acid, direct andreactive dye wastewaters from textile industry have
been deﬁned on the basis of discharged amounts,
economic relevance and representativeness of chemi-
cal structures of the contained dyes. Phanerochaete
chrysosporium provided an effective decolourization
of direct dye wastewater model, reaching about 45%
decolourization in only 1 day of treatment, and about
90% decolourization within 7 days, whilst P. ostreatus
was able to decolorize and detoxify acid dye
wastewater model providing 40% decolourization in
only 1 day, and 60% in 7 days. P. ostreatus growth
conditions that induce laccase production (up to
130,000 U/l) were identiﬁed, and extra-cellular
enzyme mixtures, with known laccase isoenzymecomposition, were produced and used in wastewater
models decolourization. The mixtures decolorized anddetoxiﬁed the acid dye wastewater model, suggesting
laccases as the main agents of wastewater decolou-
rization by P. ostreatus . A laccase mixture was
immobilized by entrapment in Cu-alginate beads, andthe immobilized enzymes were shown to be effective
in batch decolourization, even after 15 stepwise
additions of dye for a total exposure of about 1 month.

Introduction
Dyes are widely used within the food, pharmaceutical,
cosmetic, textile and leather industries. During indus-trial processing, up to 40% of the used dyestuff are
released into the process water (Vaidya and Datye
1982 ), producing highly colored wastewaters that
affect aesthetics, water transparency, and gas solubility
in water bodies. Moreover and most importantly, there
is a general concern regarding toxicity of some of thesedyes. Because of both the high discharged volumes and
the efﬂuent composition, wastewaters from the textile
industry can be considered as the most polluting amongall industrial sectors, thus greatly requiring appropriate
treatment technologies (O’Neill et al. 1999 ). All the
dyes used in the textile industry are designed to resistfading even upon exposure to many chemicals includ-
ing oxidizing agents. Although some a-biotic methodsV. Faraco ( &)/C1C. Pezzella /C1A. Miele /C1

DOI 10.1007/s10532-008-9214-2for the reduction of several dyes exist, these require
highly expensive catalysts and reagents (Robinson
et al. 2001b ). Biotechnological approaches were
proven to be potentially effective in treatment of this
pollution source in an eco-efﬁcient manner (Willmott
et al. 1998 ; McMullan et al. 2001 ; Robinson et al.
2001b ; Borchert and Libra 2001 ; Beydilli et al. 1998 ;
Zissi and Lyberatos 2001 ). The white rot fungi (WRF)
are, so far, the microorganisms most efﬁcient indegrading synthetic dyes, with basidiomycetous fungi
that are able to depolymerize and mineralize lignin.
This WRF’s property is due to the production ofextracellular lignin-modifying enzymes (LMEs),
which, because of their low substrate speciﬁcity, are
also able of degrading a wide range of xenobioticcompounds (Barr and Aust 1994 ; Pointing 2001 ;
Scheibner et al. 1997 ) including dyes (Glenn and Gold
1983 ; Pasti-Grigsby et al. 1992 ; Paszczynski et al.
1992 ; Spadaro et al. 1992 ). The main LMEs are
manganese peroxidases (MnP), E.C. 1.11.1.13, (Glenn
et al. 1986 ), lignin peroxidases (LiP), E.C. 1.11.1.14
and laccases (Lac), E.C. 1.10.3.2, (Edens et al. 1999 ).
LiP, MnP, and laccase play signiﬁcant roles in dye
metabolism by WRF (McMullan et al. 2001 ), due to the
structural similarity of the most commercially relevant
dyes to lignin (sub)structures amenable to be trans-
formed by LMEs. However, the proﬁles of LMEproduction during dye decolourization can be different
in different fungi. For instance, Lac is the main enzyme
involved in dye decolourization by cultures of Phlebia
tremellosa (Kirby et al. 2000 ; Robinson et al. 2001a ),
Pleurotus sajor-caju (Chagas and Durrant 2001 ), and
Pleurotus ostreatus (Palmieri et al. 2005a ). Whereas,
MnP, with or without LiP cooperation, was reported as
the main enzyme involved in dye decolourization by
Phanerochaete chrysosporium (Chagas and Durrant
2001 ; Kirby et al. 1995 ), and LiP was considered as the
principal decolorizing enzyme of Bjerkandera adusta
(Robinson et al. 2001b ).
There is a gap in current knowledge of decolouri-
zation and, even more, of mineralization mechanisms,
that limits our capacity to evaluate the true technical
potential of WRF and their LMEs. Moreover, these
difﬁculties are even greater if one considers thatindustrial efﬂuents show a complex composition that is
extremely variable even within the same factory, as
the case of textile industry well demonstrates.Thus, decolourization of real efﬂuents requires an
appropriate choice of fungal strains as well as ofoperative conditions. Real textile dye efﬂuents contain
not only dyes but also salts, sometimes at very high
ionic strength and extreme pH values, chelatingagents, precursors, by-products, surfactants, etc. .
Thus, in spite of the high efﬁciency in dye decolouri-
zation by some strains, decolorizing a real industrialefﬂuent is quite troublesome.
In this report, models of acid, direct and reactive
dye wastewaters from textile industry -deﬁned on thebasis of discharged amounts, economic relevance and
representativeness of chemical structures of the
contained dyes- were used to evaluate bioremediation
capabilities of the WRF Pleurotus ostreatus and
Phanerochaete chrysosporium and their LMEs.
Materials and methods
Microorganisms
Strains of the WRF P. ostreatus (Jacq.:Fr.)
Kummer (type: Florida) (ATCC no. MYA-2306) and
P. chrysosporium Burdsall M1 (DSM 13583), were
maintained through periodic transfer at 4 /C176C on agar
(1.5% w/v) plates containing undiluted and 10-fold
diluted PDY medium [24 g/l potato dextrose (Difco,
Detroit, Michigan, USA) and 5 g/l yeast extract(Difco)], respectively. The fungus P. chrysosporium
shows a higher growth rate than P. ostreatus in PDY
medium, and a comparable growth of both the fungalstrains was obtained using a 10-fold diluted PDY
medium for P. chrysosporium .
Dye containing wastewater models
Composition of the model wastewaters containing
dyes that were used in this work is reported in
Table 1. The wastewaters were sterilized by tindal-
lyzation, consisting of three 1 h cycles of incubationat 60/C176C with 24 h interval between two cycles.
Treatment of dye containing wastewater models
byP. chrysosporium andP. ostreatus
The inocula for liquid cultures were prepared by pre-
inoculating 300 ml of ME broth [20 g/l malt extract
(Difco)] in 1 l Erlenmeyer ﬂask with 6 agar plugs ofP. ostreatus (11 mm diameter) or P. chrysosporium
(14 mm diameter) mycelia, from the edge of aBiodegradation
1237-days-old agar culture, in a temperature-controlled
incubator at 28 /C176C on rotary shaker (at 125 rpm). Fifty
milliliters of a 5-day-old pre-culture were transferredin 1 l ﬂasks containing 450 ml of model wastewater
in the presence or in the absence of 2% malt extract.
Cultures were incubated in the dark at 28 /C176Co na
rotary shaker at 125 rpm.
Performances of fungal cells in model wastewater
decolourization were evaluated by recording lightabsorption spectra between 280 and 800 nm at
different times (every 24 h), compared with the corre-
sponding spectra of un-inoculated controls. Decolou-rization was measured as the extent of decrease of
spectrum area recorded between 380 and 740 nm with
respect to a control sample. All spectra were recordedafter 1:100 dilution of the sample in water.
Samples of fungal cultures of wastewater treat-
ment were daily withdrawn and used to performenzyme activity assays.
Enzyme assaysLaccase activity was assayed using 2,2
0-azinobis
(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assubstrate (Giardina et al. 1996 ). The assay mixture
contained 2 mM ABTS and 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer,
pH 3.0. Oxidation of ABTS was followed by absor-bance increase at 420 nm ( e=36,000 M
-1cm-1).
Dye-decolourizing peroxidase (DYP) activity was
assayed using Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) assubstrate (Shin et al. 1997 ). The assay mixturecontained 50 lM RBBR and 0.1 mM H
2O2in
20 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0. RBBR deg-
radation was followed by absorbance decrease at592 nm ( e=9,000 M
-1cm-1).
Aryl alcohol oxidase (AAO) activity was deter-
mined using veratryl alcohol as substrate (Sanniaet al. 1991 ). The reaction mixture contained 4 mM
veratryl alcohol in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer,
pH 6.0. Oxidation of veratryl alcohol to veratrylal-dehyde was followed by absorbance increase at
310 nm ( e=9,300 M
-1cm-1).
Manganese peroxidase (MnP) activity was deter-
mined using manganese sulfate as substrate (Giardina
et al. 2000 ). The reaction mixture contained 0.5 mM
manganese sulfate and 0.1 mM H 2O2in 50 mM
sodium malonate buffer, pH 4.5. Oxidation of Mn2?
to Mn3?was followed by absorbance increase at
270 nm ( e270=11,590 M-1cm-1) due to the for-
mation of malonate—Mn3?complex.
Lignin peroxidase (LiP) activity was determined
using veratryl alcohol as substrate (Tien and Kirk1984 ). The reaction mixture contained 2 mM veratryl
alcohol and 0.5 mM H
2O2in 50 mM sodium tartrate
buffer, pH 2.5. Oxidation of veratryl alcohol wasfollowed by measuring the absorbance increase at
310 nm ( e
310=9,300 M-1cm-1).
All the enzyme activities were measured at 25 /C176C
and expressed in International Units (IU), where one
unit of enzyme activity is deﬁned as the amount of
enzyme that oxidizes one lmole of substrate in
1 min.Table 1 Composition of colored wastewater models

123Production and characterization of laccase
mixtures from P. ostreatus
A total of 50 ml of a pre-culture of P. ostreatus were
inoculated in 1 l Erlenmeyer ﬂasks containing 450 mlof PDY [24 g/l potato dextrose (Difco), 5 g/l yeast
extract (Difco)], containing 0.15 mM CuSO
4(Sigma)
and supplemented with 2 mM ferulic acid (Sigma)after 2 days culture. After 8 days of fungal growth, the
broth was ﬁltered, and proteins were precipitated by
the addition of 80% (NH
4)2SO4at 4/C176C and centrifuged
at 10,000 gfor 30 min. Protein precipitate was resus-
pended in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.5 and
extensively dialyzed against the same buffer. Thesample was centrifuged, and the supernatant was
concentrated on an Amicon PM-10 membrane
(Millipore). Enzyme samples were treated with1 mM PMSF (Sigma) and stored at -80/C176C to be used
in the treatment of dye containing wastewater models
or for analyses of laccase isoenzyme composition.
Laccase isoenzyme fractionation
Ultra-ﬁltrated protein samples were loaded on a
Resource Q (GE Healthcare) column equilibrated
with 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer pH 7. The column waswashed at a ﬂow rate of 1 ml/min with 3 ml of buffer,
and a 0–0.5 M NaCl linear gradient (20 ml) was
applied. Fractions containing laccase activity werepooled and concentrated.
Non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis
Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was
performed at alkaline pH under nondenaturing
conditions. The separating and stacking gels were,
respectively, at 9 and 4% acrylamide, buffer solutionswere 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 9.5) for separating gel
and 18 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5) for stacking gel, and
the electrode reservoir solution was 25 mM Tris,190 mM glycine, pH 8.4. Gels were stained for
laccase activity using ABTS as substrate.
Treatment of dye containing wastewater models
by laccase mixtures from P. ostreatus
Batch decolourization experiments using laccase
mixtures as free enzymes were performed incubatingcrude preparation of laccase mixture containing
different enzyme amounts (0.1, 1, 10 or 100 U/ml)
with wastewater models, at room temperatures.Decolourization was evaluated recording UV-VIS
absorption spectra at different times (10 min, 30 min,
1 h, 4 h, 24 h) of enzyme incubation and calculatedas the extent of decrease of spectrum area recorded
between 380 and 740 nm in comparison with the
corresponding area of the spectrum of the untreatedwastewater model.
Immobilization of laccase mixtures
from P. ostreatus
The immobilization was carried out according to the
procedure reported by Palmieri et al. ( 2005b ). 2000 U
of crude laccase preparation of laccase mixture were
mixed with 35 ml of 3% sodium alginate solution(low viscosity, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), centrifuged at
4,000 rev min
-1for 5 min to remove air bubbles, and
extruded drop by drop through a needle (0.4 mminternal diameter) into a 0.15 M CuSO
4aqueous
solution (pH 4.0) under continuous stirring. The
resulting spherical blue beads were left to solidify forat least 30 min in the copper solution and then
washed exhaustively with distilled water until pH
5.0–5.5 was reached. The total wet weight of beadsobtained from 1 ml of sodium alginate solution was
about 0.7 g. The beads were stored wet at 4 /C176C.
Batch-mode decolourization by immobilized
P. ostreatus laccase mixtures
In a typical experiment, 1 g of beads (with a mean
diameter of 2.7 mm) containing about 50 U laccase
activity was added to 2 ml of acid dye wastewatermodel solution. The reaction was incubated at room
temperature under vigorous stirring. Each experiment
was performed in a repeated sequencing batch deco-lourization. Each cycle consisted of the addition of the
acid dye wastewater model solution to the laccase
alginate beads. A new cycle was initiated when no
further change in the dye (Abu 62) concentration was
observed by monitoring the absorbance decrease at637 nm. Control samples, consisting of alginate beads
without any entrapped enzyme, were run in parallel
under identical conditions. Each experiment has beenrepeated at least three times, and standard deviations
were determined.Biodegradation
123Production of manganese peroxidase and lignin
peroxidase containing mixtures from P.
chrysosporium
Different P. chrysosporium growth conditions in
liquid culture have been tested for MnP and LiP
activity production. 50 ml of a pre-culture of P.
chrysosporium (6 agar plugs with 14 mm diameter
from the edge of 7-days-old agar culture in 1 l ﬂask
containing 300 ml of 2% malt extract) were inocu-
lated in 1 l Erlenmeyer ﬂasks containing 450 ml of10-fold diluted [2.4 g/l potato dextrose (Difco), 0.5 g/
l yeast extract (Difco)] PDY broth or 2% malt extract
broth supplemented with 0.1 or 1 mM MnSO
4.
Culture broth was concentrated by ultra-ﬁltration by
using a 30 kDa cartridge in the Quix Stand Benchtop
system (GE Healthcare).
Analysis of detoxiﬁcation abilities
Toxicity of wastewater models before and after
fungal treatment or incubation with enzyme mixture
was measured with Lumistox 300 system (HACHLANGE, S.r.l. Milan—Italy), using freeze-dried
Vibrio ﬁscheri bioluminescent bacteria as test
micro-organism. The inhibition of the natural lightemission of these microorganisms, caused by toxic
substances, was measured.
All the samples to be tested were prepared
according to the manufacture’s instructions. Conduc-
tivity, pH and optical density (OD) were measured.
The pH was set to 7.0 ±0.2 with HCl or NaOH and
their salt content was adjusted to 2% NaCl when the
measured conductivity was lower than 35 mS/cm.
Both acid and direct dye model wastewaters (with
and without malt extract addition) showed O.D. values
[1,800 mE, that required preparation of wastewaters
dilutions to have ﬁnal O.D. values \1,800 mE. All the
measures were performed in color correction mode in
order to reduce the interferences caused by physical
absorption or light scattering. Toxicity values (deﬁnedas percent of inhibition of bacterial bioluminescence)
of these wastewaters at the new deﬁned concentra-
tions were measured.
Analysis of COD
Determination of COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand)
with the dichromate method was performed usingHACH (COD High range vials) apparatus (HACH
LANGE, S.r.l. Milan—Italy) according to the man-
ufacture’s instructions. A calibration curve wasobtained using HACH COD standard solution
(800 mg O
2/l). Appropriate dilutions of each sample
were assayed.
Results and discussion
Treatment of dye containing wastewater models
byP. chrysosporium andP. ostreatus cultures
The effect of P. chrysosporium andP. ostreatus liquid
cultures on colored acid, direct and reactive dyeindustrial wastewater models was evaluated both in
the presence and in the absence of nutrients. The
wastewater models were deﬁned in the frame ofEuropean Union Sixth Framework Program funded
project SOPHIED (contract NMP2-CT2004-505899)
on the basis of discharged amounts by textile industry,economic relevance and representativeness of chemi-
cal structures of the contained dyes (Table 1). Values
of pH and salt concentration were chosen as thosereproducing the characteristics of the real industrial
efﬂuents.
P. chrysosporium caused an effective decolouri-
zation of direct dye wastewater models when
supplemented with nutrients, reaching 46% decolou-
rization in only 1 day of treatment, and 87%decolourization within 7 days. Spectra analysis
revealed that fungal treatment is effective on all the
dyes present in the wastewater model, giving acomplete depletion of the peaks at 582, 541 and
419 nm corresponding to the dyes Direct Blue 71
(Trisazo), Direct Red 80 (Polyazo) and Direct Yellow106 (Stilbene), respectively (Fig. 1a). However, a
new absorbance peak centered at 357 nm was
observed in the spectrum of the wastewater modelafter fungal treatment, thus suggesting the formation
of a new product inducing a signiﬁcant shift of
wastewater colour from dark to yellow. The complete
removal of the major visible light absorbance peaks
and the signiﬁcant spectral change observed after P.
chrysosporium treatment of direct wastewater suggest
a degradation of the dyes by the fungus (Knapp et al.
1995 ). Fungal treatment of the wastewater also
determined a pH shift of the growth medium from
8.4 to 4.5 within 7 days. Spectra of samples of directBiodegradation
123dye wastewater model at different pH values in the
range 8.4–4.5 were recorded allowing us to rule out
that the variations observed in the spectrum after
fungal treatment were due to a pH change. We couldnot directly correlate the decolourization of the
wastewater by P. chrysosporium to the production
of oxidative enzyme activities potentially involved inthe process, since residual color interfered with
assays of MnP and LiP activities, the enzymes
reported as the mainly responsible for decolourizationbyP. chrysosporium (Champagne 2005).
P. ostreatus proved to be capable to decolorize acid
dye wastewater model with and without addition of
malt extract, providing 40% decolourization after only
1 day of treatment in the absence of nutrient, andreaching up to 60 and 66% of decolourization after 7
and 14 days, respectively, in the presence of nutrients.
Spectra analysis revealed that fungal treatment is moreeffective on the dyes Acid Blue 62 (anthraquinonic
dye) and Acid Red 266 (azo dye), with a dramaticreduction of the maximum absorbance peaks at 637
and 595 nm, due to Abu62, and of maximum absor-
bance peak at 500 nm due to AR266. On the otherhand, Acid Yellow 149 (azo dye) seems to be more
recalcitrant to biodegradation, its maximum absor-
bance peak at 402 nm being only slightly decreased(Fig. 1b). These results indicated a different efﬁciency
ofP. ostreatus in degrading the tested acid dyes.
Oxidative enzyme activities [laccase, Mn Peroxi-
dase (Mnp), Lignin peroxidase (LiP) dye decolou-
rizing peroxidase (DyP, Johjima et al. 2003 ), Veratryl
Alchol Oxidase (VAO)] were assayed in decolorizedsamples treated by P. ostreatus . Only laccase activity
was revealed since the ﬁrst day of incubation, and a
constant level of enzyme production (10
-3U/ml)
during fungal treatment of the wastewater model was
observed. Therefore, laccase activity seems to be the
oxidative activity mainly involved in dye decolouri-zation by P. ostreatus .
No decolourization of reactive wastewater model
was obtained, neither by P. chrysosporium nor by P.
ostreatus , both in the presence and in the absence of
added nutrients. This can be ascribed to the loss of
fungi vitality, due to the extreme pH (10–12) and saltconcentration (70 g/l) conditions of the waste. As a
matter of fact, it has been demonstrated that both the
fungi loose their vitality after treatment of reactivedye wastewater, whilst vitality was retained after
treatment of the acid and direct dye wastewater
models. The observation that P. chrysosporium was
able to decolourize the direct wastewater, character-
ized by a high pH value (9), suggested that the loss of
the fungus vitality during the treatment of reactivedye wastewater can be ascribed to the higher salt
concentration (70 g/l) of this wastewater in compar-
ison with that of direct wastewater (5 g/l).
Hence the fungal strains P. ostreatus and
P. chrysosporium showed different speciﬁcities in
decolorizing the dye wastewater models. Phanerochaete
chrysosporium proved to be able to decolourize direct
dyes having complex -Trisazo, Polyazo and Stilbene-
structures, whilst P. ostreatus did not decolorize these
dyes but was showed to be able to decolourize
anthraquinonic and aniline azo dyes. That is consistentwith some previously reported studies (Knapp et al.
1995 ; Swamy and Ramsay 1999 ; Balan and Monteiro
2001 ; Martins et al. 2003 ; Eichlerova et al. 2005 ; Nozaki
et al. 2008 ), showing different speciﬁcities of WRF in
dye decolorization.

123The different decolourization speciﬁcities of P.
ostreatus and P. chrysosporium can be due to the
different proﬁles of produced LMEs, mainly laccases
inP. ostreatus and MnP in P. chrysosporium .
Treatment of dye containing wastewater
byP. ostreatus laccases
In order to test the ability of P. ostreatus laccases to
decolorize dye wastewater models and to verify the
hypothesis that laccase activity is the oxidative
activity mainly involved in decolourization of acid
dye wastewater by P. ostreatus , an extracellular
enzyme mixture endowed with high laccase activity
levels was produced from P. ostreatus and incuba-
tions of the wastewater models with the laccase
mixture were performed.
High levels of laccase activity production (up to
1309103U/l) were obtained in a potato-dextrose
(24 g/l) broth supplemented with yeast extract (5 g/l),
0.15 mM CuSO 4and 2 mM ferulic acid, a low cost
growth medium (4.4 euro/l). In this growth condition
a quite constant production level of laccase activity
was also detected throughout the 8–11 days period.
Laccase isoenzyme composition was determined in
culture supernatants, withdrawn after 8 days of
fungal growth, and fractionated by ammonium
sulphate precipitation and anionic exchange chroma-
tography fractioning. Two laccase activity peaks
were obtained. The corresponding fractions were
pooled, concentrated, and analyzed by electrophoretic
separation on native PAGE gels stained for laccase
activity. The identity of the laccase isoenzymes in the
laccase activity peaks was ascertained on the basis of
the different electophoretic mobility of the laccase
isoenzymes. The extracellular enzyme mixture was
showed to contain POXA3 (Palmieri et al. 2003 ) and
POXC (Giardina et al. 1996 ) isoenzymes, the latter
one being the most abundant (99%).
When the wastewater models (Table 1) were
prepared for incubations with the enzyme mixture,
they were not tindallysed, since antiseptic conditions
are not strictly required. Reactive dye wastewater
model was used at pH 10.
The laccase mixture decolorized acid dye waste-
water model up to 35% decolourization after
incubation with only 0.1 U/ml of laccase in 24 h,
and up to 30% after only 1 h incubation with 1 U/ml.
An increase in enzyme concentration does notcorrespond to a proportional increase in the extent
of decolourization (Fig. 2). The modiﬁcations of
the absorption spectra following the enzymatic treat-
ment of the wastewater model are similar to those
produced by P. ostreatus , thus suggesting that
laccases are the main agents of the wastewater model
decolourization by the fungus. A quick depletion of
the maximum absorbance peaks at 637 and 595 nm—
due to Acid Blue 62—was observed just after an
incubation of 10 min. This behaviour was conﬁrmed
by treating the single dyes with the laccase mixtures,
that provided a fast decolourization of Acid Blue 62
(anthraquinone dye), a slower decolourization—
taking 24 h—of Acid Red 266 (azo dye), whilst Acid
Yellow 49 (azo dye) was resistant to laccase
decolourization. The differences in decolourization
efﬁciency can be ascribed to structural differences of
the dyes and to substrate speciﬁcity of the laccase
isoenzymes. As reported in literature, anthraquinonic
dyes are good substrates for laccases, while degrada-
bility of azo dyes depends on their different aromatic
substitution patterns (Chivukula and Renganathan
1995 ), and among them phenol and aniline azo dyes
can be degraded by laccases (Kandelbauer et al.
2004 ). This could allow us to explain the more
efﬁcient degradation of the anthraquinone-type dye
Acid Blue 62, compared with that of the aniline azo
dye Acid Red 266. Lack of a hydroxyl or an amine
group on the aromatic ring of the azo dye Acid
Yellow 49 should explain the inability of P. ostreatus
laccases to degrade this dye.
The laccase mixture proved to be poorly active in
the decolourization of direct dye wastewater, even
when up to 100 U/ml of enzyme were used. The
extreme conditions of pH and salt concentration
of this wastewater model could prevent efﬁcient

123functioning of laccases in decolourization. In fact a
slight increase in decolourization is achieved by
lowering the pH of direct dye wastewater from 9 to 5.Spectra analysis revealed that the enzymatic treat-
ment is effective only on Direct Blue 71 (Trisazo), as
indicated by the decrease of absorbance intensity atthe wavelength of maximum absorption of this dye
(582 nm), while the other two dyes Direct Red 80
(Polyazo) and Direct Yellow 106 (Stilbene) showedto be resistant to the enzymatic degradation.
No decolourization was observed for reactive dye
wastewater after incubation with laccase mixture,even if the enzyme concentration was increased up to
100 U/ml. In order to verify that the absence of any
decolourization effect is due to the extreme pH value(10) of the reactive wastewater, decolourization
experiments were performed lowering the pH of the
wastewater model to 6. No decolourization wasobserved for reactive dye wastewater although the
pH lowering, thus ruling out the hypothesis that the
extreme pH value of this wastewater model hadinhibited enzyme decolourization activity.
Treatment of wastewater models by laccase
mixtures from P. ostreatus entrapped
in Cu-alginate beads
Effectiveness of P. ostreatus laccase mixture
entrapped in Cu-alginate beads in decolourizing RBBR
(Remazol Brilliant Blue R) had been previouslyestablished (Palmieri et al. 2005a ,b). Although the
reported data suggested the possibility to use this
system in wastewater treatment, it was necessary toverify the stability of the support in the wastewater
models. No alteration of beads consistency was
observed after 24 h incubation in acid dye wastewatermodel, whereas a big stress was given by direct dye
wastewater, and a complete dissolution of beads was
produced by reactive dye wastewater model.
The enzymatic extracellular mixture was immobi-
lized by entrapment in Cu-alginate beads and the
immobilized enzymes used in batch decolourization
experiments on acid dye wastewater model.
The dye decolourization process was efﬁcient even
after 15 stepwise dye additions taking about 1 month,
providing up to 80% decrease of absorbance at 637 nm
(Fig. 3a). Even if the time needed to achieve 50%
decolourization exponentially increased (Fig. 3b), the
t
1/2of the 15th cycle was as low as 7 h.Production of manganese peroxidase mixtures
from P. chrysosporium for treatment of dye
containing wastewater models
To test the performance of P. chrysosporium extra-
cellular enzymes in the decolourization process,conditions to optimize enzyme (MnP and LiP)
production and to prepare enriched enzyme mixtures
have been investigated. Among the different P.
chrysosporium growth conditions tested, the best
selected growth medium for MnP production
contained potato-dextrose broth (2.4 g/l) added withyeast extract (0.5 g/l) and 0.1 mM MnSO
4. Further
increase of MnSO 4concentration resulted in a
decrease of MnP activity production. However, LiPactivity was not detected in any tested condition.
The enriched enzyme mixture containing MnP
activity was used in batch decolourization experi-ments performed incubating 0.1 or 0.01 U/ml enzyme
with direct dye wastewater model and recording UV-
VIS absorption spectra at different times (1, 24 andA % residual  absorbance at 637nm75

Sodium Malonate pH 4.5 with or without addition of
0.5 mM MnSO 4and of 0.1 mM H 2O2, by using the
wastewater at pH 9 or lowering pH to 4.5. The best
performance of the enzyme mixture was observed in
decolorizing the 10-fold diluted wastewater model, in50 mM Sodium Malonate pH 4.5 in the presence of
MnSO
4. The mixture was able to decolorize undi-
luted wastewater giving about 40% decrease ofabsorbance at 600 nm after only 1 h, whilst to
observe a complete depletion of the 600 nm absor-
bance peak, a 10-fold dilution of the wastewater wasrequired. When decolourization was evaluated as
decrease of spectrum area between 380 and 740 nm,
only 15% decolourization was revealed after 48 h,whilst about 50% of decolourization after 24 h was
observed on 10-fold diluted direct dye wastewater
model. The addition of 0.1 mM H
2O2did not affect
the decolourization efﬁciency. When tested on each
of the dyes present in the direct dye wastewater
model, the MnP containing samples were shown to bemore effective in decolorizing Direct Blue 71,
reaching 50% of decolourization, evaluated as the
decrease of spectrum area between 380 and 740 nmof the undiluted dye, after 24 h.
Only some of the spectral modiﬁcations produced
byP. chrysosporium treatment were observed after
enzyme incubations, thus suggesting involvement of
other fungal metabolites or enzymes during in vivo
decolourization process.
Variability of MnP production by fungus and low
stability of the enzymes hindered further scale up of
the system. The low stability is reported as a commonproperty of MnP enzymes (Sutherland and Aust
1996 ; Timofeevski and Aust 1997 ).
Analyses of detoxiﬁcation and COD reduction
abilities
Toxicity of the acid dye wastewater model after 24 h
treatment with 0.1U/ml of the laccase mixture and at
the end of treatment with P. ostreatus was evaluated
by using Lumistox 300. EC50 could be only
measured for acid dye wastewaters with malt extract
added, and the values determined for untreated andfungal treated were 43.3 and 10.4% respectively. For
the acid dye wastewater without malt extract, toxicity
of a 50% dilution with a ﬁnal O.D. values \1,800 mE
was tested. Reduction of the toxicity of the waste-
water was provided by fungal treatment both in the
presence and in the absence of added nutrients, whilsta less extent of toxicity reduction was obtained by the
enzyme incubation (Table 2), thus suggesting the
involvement of other fungal components in detoxiﬁ-cation during in vivo process.
Toxicity of direct dye wastewater model treated by
P. chrysosporium could not be evaluated because of
the low reproducibility of toxicity measurements
obtained with these samples, due to too low sample
concentration (required by the color correctionmode).
Reduction of COD of acid and direct dye waste-
waters after fungal treatment was not detectable inthe presence of added malt extract because of the
high contribute of the nutrient to overall COD value.

Conclusions
In conclusion, in this report decolourization capabili-
ties of the fungi P. chrysosporium andP. ostreatus and
of free and immobilized laccase mixtures from P.
ostreatus on industrial dye wastewaters have been
demonstrated. A different decolourization speciﬁcity
was exhibited by the fungi, P. chrysosporium being
active in decolorizing the direct wastewater model
containing dyes with complex—Trisazo, Polyazo,
Stilbene- structures, whilst P. ostreatus provided
decolourization of the acid wastewater model.
Laccases were identiﬁed as the main agents of
wastewater decolourization by P. ostreatus and their
preference in decolourizing anthraquinonic type dye
and aniline mono-azo dye allowed us to explain ability
ofP. ostreatus to decolourize acid wastewater model.
On the other hand, P. ostreatus is unable to decolourize
the direct wastewater model, possibly because of the
presence of complex poly-azo and stilbene structures,not degraded by laccases. A system based on immo-
bilized laccase mixtures was also shown active in
decolurization and can be further improved for largescale applications. On the other hand, manganese
peroxidases are involved in direct wastewater model
decolourization by P. chrysosporium , and the different
proﬁles of LMEs produced by the fungi can explain
their different decolorization speciﬁcities.
It’s worth noting the ability of P. chrysosporium to
decolourize the direct wastewater that is characterized
by a high (9) pH value, whilst for majority of the fungi
the optimum pH for dye decolourization lies in theacidic range (Asgher et al. 2008 ; Kapdan et al. 2000 ;
Parshetti et al. 2007 ). However, such low pHs are not
suitable for the wastewater treatment and hence, fungal
strains able to decolourize dyes efﬁciently at wider pH
ranges are desirable for industrial applications.
While many studies were devoted to biodecolouri-
sation of the textile dyes, few manuscripts have been
reported on decolourization of dye efﬂuents in whichthe presence of salts and high dye concentration may
be inhibitory to biological agents. Decolorization ofreactive dye industry efﬂuents was demonstrated by
the fungi Aspergillus fumigatus (Jin et al. 2007 ) and
Phanerochaete sordida (Harazono and Nakamura
2005 ), and by fungal oxidative enzymes (Zille et al.
2003 ; Mohorcic et al. 2006 ). Knapp and Newby ( 1999 )
reported decolourization of a diluted chemical indus-try efﬂuent containing a diazo-linked chromophore by
white-rot fungi. Taking also into account the high dye
concentrations and the presence of salts in the testedwastewaters, P. chrysosporium and P. ostreatus
exhibited good decolourization performances.
The potential of P. ostreatus to be used as an
effective detoxifying microorganism for acid dye
wastewaters have also been demonstrated. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report on thisdetoxifying potential.

1. Introduction  
Extensive research efforts have been dedicat ed to evaluate the potential applications 
of laccases in bioremediation processes, particularly for the treatment of industrial 
coloured wastewaters. Howe ver, any biotechnological use of laccases may be 
hampered by their non-reusability as well as  by the high sensitivity to the harsh 
conditions provided by industrial effluent s, i.e. extreme pH  values, high salt 
concentration, presence of organic ag ents and detergents. Many of these 
undesirable constraints may be removed by the use of immobilized enzymes. In 
addition to a more convenient handling of enzyme preparations, the desirable 
benefits of enzyme immobilizat ion are the easy separation of the enzyme from the 
reaction volume and reuse of the enzyme. These advantages, coupled to the possibility to employ enzymes in conti nuously operated bioreactor, are especially 
attractive to cope with the huge volu me of polluted wastewaters demanding 
remediation. Moreover, it is widely demon strated that immobilization can improve 
enzyme stability against thermal and chem ical denaturation, by decreasing their 
flexibility and thus resulti ng in more suitable catalysts for industrial applications. 
Several techniques may be applied to immo bilize enzymes on solid supports [1], they 
are mainly based on chemical and physi cal mechanisms. Both methods offer 
advantages and drawbacks, thus  the choice of a proper  technique depends on the 
application to which immobilized enzymes are addressed. The simplest immobilization techniques are based on the physical adsorption of enzymes on solid 
carriers. This method provides high enzymat ic activity bound to the solid phase since 
it slightly modifies the enzyme native structure. Ho wever, adsorption phenomena 
depend on ionic strength and pH of the liquid phase so the biocatalyst can suffer 
from high enzyme leakage, in  particular under the harsh and variable conditions 
provided by the treated wastew aters. The same constraint s are valid for entrapment 
based methods, in which enzyme molecules are entrapped into a proper matrix by a 
purely physical caging or by covalent bindi ng. In this case, the mechanical properties 
and the stability of the matrix  limit the applicability of this technique to wastewater 
treatment. Covalent immobilization repres ents an attractive alternative to obtain 
enzymatic catalyst for wastewater treat ment. This method provides twofold 
enhancement of biocatalyst performance: i) covalent bonding prevents enzyme 
leakage even under harsh conditions, ii) enzyme deactivation rate is reduced comparing with that characteristic of en zyme in liquid phase.  The stabilization 
provided by covalent bonding is counterbal anced by partial deactivation occurring 
when the immobilization is performed. Co valent linkages to the support usually 
perturb the protein native structure resulti ng in a reduction of the initial activity 
available in the liquid enzyme solution. Th is negative effect can be mitigated by 
carefully optimizing the immobilization condi tions in order to maximize the ratio 
between immobilized enzyme activity and acti vity of the primary enzyme solution. 
 In a previous chapter, P. ostreatus  laccase immobilization by entrapment in copper 
alginate beads has been described. Alt hough this system provided high 
immobilization yields coupled to an effect ive Acid wastewater decolourisation in 
batch system, it seems to be not su itable to be employed in continuous 
decolourisation of dye mixtures, due to t he low mechanical stabi lity of alginate beads. 
Thus, covalent immobilization techniques have been investigated. It is well known 
that many factors influence the final properties and the performances of covalent  46enzyme-carrier systems: the morphology of the carrier (e.g. gel type, monomers, 
cross-linker, porosity), the polymers chemistry (e.g. type of active groups, their 
concentration, hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance on the carrier surface) as well as the 
activation and immobilization procedures (c hemical groups invo lved and accessibility 
of amino acids for attachment ). This means that  the selection of the most suitable 
carrier for a given enzyme may require  the screening of many supports and 
immobilization procedures.  Russo et al. [2] investigated the decolourisation performances of P. ostreatus  
laccases covalently bounded on a commerc ially available activated carrier 
(EUPERGIT C 250L
©). They assessed dye conversion kinetics of the immobilized 
laccase mixture. Moreover, they performed a theoretical study t hat highlighted the 
relevance of the balance between immobili zation efficiency and immobilized laccase 
deactivation rate on the performance of a continuous decolourisation process carried 
out in a fixed bed reactor loaded with immobilized laccases.  On the basis of these results, laccase  covalent immobiliz ation on a purposely 
activated inert support has been performed. To this aim,  a siliceous inert carrier, 
perlite, was chosen. Perlite is  derived from naturally occurring siliceous rock. It is an 
amorphous aluminium silicate with more th an 70% content of silica. This carrier 
exhibits several advantages over or ganic ones, including a greater mechanical 
stability, resistance toward microbial atta ck and organic solvents. Several inorganic 
support materials, such as silica gels, al umina, zeolite have been successfully used 
for immobilization of enzymes; however, per lite turns out to be a cheaper alternative 
in comparison to the above mentioned materials.  The choice of such an inert support imp lies that its surface has to be properly 
modified in order to offer functional groups for protein binding. Silica based materials 
modified by inorganic and by organic functional  groups have been arouse 
considerable interest due to the number of possible applic ations [3] As a matter of 
fact, surface modification of these ma terials can be easily achieved and their 
reactivity may be finely tuned in the derivatiz ation steps [4]. Chemical modification of 
perlite is mainly related to the presence of silanol groups  on its surface. Surface 
modifications are usually achieved by silanization with appropriate organosilane 
agents, followed by activation with several crosslinking agents (i.e. glutaraldehyde, 
carbodimmide).  Silanization is a crucial st ep in regard to subsequent repr oducibility of the chemical 
functionalization. It provides the reactive amino groups susceptib le to the following 
activation with glutaraldehyde.  Although silanization has  been extensively studied, 
the resulting surface cover age, orientation and organizati on are still a subject of 
controversy [5]. Despite it re sulted in a lower surface c oncentration of amino groups 
in comparison with reacti on in organic solvents, aqueous  silanization with a 
trifunctional silane APTS (aminopropyltrime thosysilane) has been selected for this 
study, since it was demonstrated to result  in a more stable and uniform immobilized 
enzyme layer [6]. Glutaraldehyde is a bi-functional reactive  agent which has been extensively used as 
an enzyme immobilizing agent. Although there are many discussions on the 
composition of the glutar aldehyde solution (monomeric and polymeric forms) and on 
the structures responsible for its properties, it  is generally accepted that it is able of 
reacting with the surface amine groups of  enzyme and carriers, through the formation 
of Schiff bases and Michael adducts [7].  47In the following section the opt imization of immobilization te chnique, including carrier 
activation, is described. Furthermore, the biocatalyst obtained was preliminary tested 
for the conversion of the reacti ve dye Remazol Brilliant Blue R.  
 
2. Materials and Methods 
Production of Laccase mixture  
P. ostreatus  culture conditions and crude laccase extraction were performed 
according to protocols described in chapter 1. 
Dye 
The anthraquinonic dye Rema zol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) was purchased from 
Sigma-Aldrich. Powder purity was 50%. Dye concentration was measured by 
recording optical absorbance at 592nm . The extinction  coefficient ( ε592=9,000M-1cm-
1), referred to total powder concentration,  was corrected taking into account the 
purity. 
Perlite pre-treatment  and derivatization  
Perlite (SIPERNAT 22©) was provided by Degussa. Soli ds were sieved in the range 
90-150 µm  Perlite was pre- treated with 1.2M HNO 3 at 60°C for 4 h ours following, it 
was extensive washed with water and dried at 60°C. Carrier derivatization was 
performed as follows: 0.2g of  dry pre-treated perlite was mixed with 4÷0.4% APTS 
(aminopropyltrimethoxysilane) in 5mL dissolved water and in cubated at 80°C for 2h 
with constant mixing. Then, the su spension was washed thoroughly with 50mM 
Sodium Phosphate (NaP) buffer pH 6.5 and treated with glutarald ehyde solutions, at 
different concentration in the same buffer for 2h at room temperature. The activated 
perlite was extensively washed  with the over cited buffer and finally incubated for 1h 
with a solution of laccase mixture in 50mM Sodium Phosphate buffe r pH 6.5 at room 
temperature. Residual active sites were  saturated by 1h incubation with 100mM 
glycine at room temperature. 
 Adsorption experiments  
Dye adsorption on solid particles was dete rmined by incubating 0.2g of solid in a 
RBBR solution at a pre-set concentration. A ll the experiments were performed in the 
conditions usually adopted dur ing dye conversion tests: 20mM Sodium Acetate pH 
4.5 at room temperature. Dye concentration in the liquid phase was measured by 
monitoring optical absorbance at 592nm. The occurrence of adsorption was revealed 
by the decrease of absorbance in the liquid phas e, as well as by an increase of solids 
colouration. Each experiment was accompli shed putting in contact dye solution with 
the solid particles, once no further change of dye concentration in the liquid was 
measured (achievement of equilibrium between solids and liqui d) the liquid was 
replaced with fresh dye solution. The cycl ing operation was repeated until no change 
in the initial concentration of dye was obs erved. The overall am ount of adsorbed dye 
was calculated from the difference between the initial and final concentration in the 
liquid phase for each cycle.  
Assay of immobilized enzyme  
Activity of laccase immobilized on perlite wa s estimated by measuring the oxidation 
rate of ABTS in a recirc ulating fixed bed reactor pr eviously designed for the 
assessment of activity of enzymes immob ilized on granular solids [2]. The device is 
equipped with a fixed bed reac tor, loaded with biocatalyst particles, operated by 
circulating the liquid phase containing the substrate. The operating conditions were 
purposely selected in order to  prevent mass transfer limitat ions during the enzymatic 
conversion so that the assay was carri ed out under kinetic controlled regime. The 
operating conditions were suitably adapt ed to the perlite based biocatalyst. In  48particular, the total volume of the reacto r and was set at 72mL, the tubular reactor 
was packed with a fixed amount of solid bi ocatalyst of 0.18mL,  and the liquid was 
circulated by means of a gear pum p at a flow r ange of 20mL/min.  
Fluidized bed reactor for RBBR conversion  
Conversion of RBBR by immobilized laccas es was investigated in a fluidized bed 
reactor continuously operated with respect to the liquid phase. A sketch of the 
apparatus is shown in figure 1.  Biocatalyst particles are placed in a tubular reactor (2.5cm ID, 30cm long). Solid 
particles were fluidized by the liquid stream 
delivered by a gear pump (VG 1000 digit, Verder). Dye-bearing liquid solution was fed at different flow rates by the means of a peristaltic pump (Miniplus, Gilson) connected to the feed tank. Dye concentration in the waste stream was measured continuously by means of a spectrophotometer (Cary 50, Varian Inc.) equipped with a flow-cell. Optical absorbance was measured at 592nm. Dye conversion was carried out in conditions assessed as optimal for RBBR 
decolourisation: 20mM Sodium acetate pH 4.5 buffer at room temperature [8].    
3. Results and discussion 
Optimization of immobilizati on process on activated perlite
 
In this section the results on the optimizat ion of immobilization of the crude laccase 
preparation on perlite are reported. The pr ocedure has been described in material 
and methods section and is schematically drawn in figure 2.  
 Activity of laccase immobilized on perlite was measured employing a s pecifically designed 
device as described in material and methods 
section [2]. Immobilization yield (Y) is the parameter monitored to optimize the immobilization protocol. It was defined as the ratio between laccase activity expressed by solids biocatalyst and total activity  available in the liquid 
solution at the beginnin g of the immobilization 
processes.

   50-Effect of glutaraldehyde concentration 
The effect of glutaraldehyde concentra tion on immobilization yield has been 
investigated in the range 0.5-5% vol. Resu lts reported in Table 1 (runs 1-3-5-8-10) 
indicate that immobilization yield is not affected by incr easing glutaraldehyde 
concentration up to 5%. It is worth to note that, in all the tested conditions, no laccase activity or protein were det ected in the recovered supe rnatant, indicating that 100% 
of the initial protein content  of the crude laccase mixtur e was bounded to the carrier.  
These results indicate that the reac tive groups obtained with the lowest 
glutaraldehyde concentration are sufficient to bind the total prot ein content of the 
laccase mixtures. Thus, further immobiliz ation experiments were carried out setting 
glutaraldehyde concentration at 0.5% vol.  
- Effect of pH and ionic strength 
One of the factors that can affect enzym e immobilization is the pH-value of the 
coupling mixture. The resu lts obtained performing laccase  immobilization at pH 
values 5.5, 6.5 and 7.5 are li sted in table 1 (runs R17-R 22). The immobilization yield 
decreased at lower pH values, while it re mains constant in the neutral pH range. 
When the immobilization was carried out at  higher ionic strength (runs 21-22) a 
significant reduction of immobilization yield was observed. In the latter conditions, up 
to 28% of initial laccase ac tivity was detected in the supernatants. These findings 
could be a consequence of the heterofunctiona l nature of the activated matrix: after 
glutaraldehyde activation, the support ma y expose unreacted amino-groups which 
confer some ionic exchanger  features to the support [4]. In such type of 
heterofunctional matrices, a first ionic adsor ption of the protein on the amino groups 
of the support was found to occur before t he covalent reaction. Thus, high ionic 
strength or certain pH values can promote this physical inte raction, resulting in lower 
immobilization yields.  
- Temperature and time of incubation 
The effect of incubation temperature 
on immobilization yield has been assessed comparing the experiments R1-R10. Lowering the incubation temperature to 4°C did not result in an improvement in the immobilization yield with respect to the reaction 
carried out at room temperature. In 
addition, extending the incubation time to over-night incubation (at 4°C) caused a decrease in immobilization yield (compare R1-R3 with R2-R4) or resulted in almost comparable results (compare R5 to R6) with respect to 4 hours room-temperat ure incubation. 
Fig 3 reports the data of laccase activity and total protein content recorded in the 
liquid supernatant as a func tion of the incubation time. After 15 minutes incubation, 
both measured values become negligible, indicating the i mmobilization of all the 
proteins contained in the crude mixture. Hence, fu rther experiments were 
accomplished fixing incubation time at  1h without any temperature control.

Immobilized activity, IU/g- Effect of total activity and total protein contents 
A few immobilization tests were carried out  by changing the ratio between initial 
laccase activity and mass of dry support in the range 80-800I U/g (experiments R11-
R13). For a given amount of dry support, resu lts showed that the immobilization yield 
decreased with increasing amount of initial laccase activity while the immobilized activity (IU/g) tend to a constant value (FIG.4). It can be speculated that this effect could 
be a consequence of protein 
overcrowding on the carrier surface which may reduce substrate accessibility to the active site.  However, the subsequent series of experiments  (runs R14-R16) enabled to 
rule out this hypothesis. As a fact, when 
protein content, corresponding to a certain activity (IU/g), was increased by adding BSA no decrease in immobilization yield was observed, as it 
was expected if the above hypothesis was verifi ed. Moreover, it is worth to note that 
proteins were completely bounded to the support even at the highest concentration. 
Both series of data (R11-13 and R14-16) can be accounted for considering that 
access of substrate to immobilized enzyme wa s restricted by the irreversible sealing 
of carrier micro-pores by polymeric co mponents contained in the crude mixture, 
whose amount increases when a more c oncentrated laccase mixture was used. 
 On the basis of the above-mentioned results,  the optimal parameter s selected are: i) 
solids activation with 0.5% glutaraldehyde,  ii) 1h incubation with laccase mixture 
(50mM Sodium Phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 80I U/g support) at room  temperature. In 
these conditions, a maximum immobilizatio n yield of about 70% was achieved. As 
expected, there is a differenc e between the actual laccase activity expressed by the 
biocatalyst and the activity loss in the liqu id supernatant. This effect is due to the 
modifications of the enzyme structures o ccurring during covalent immobilization: non-
productive enzyme orientation,  decreased protein flexibilit y resulting form multi-point 
attachment, and involvement of crucial amino acids in covalent binding. 
 
Assessment of stability and catalytic parameters
 
The performances of the immobilized bi osystem have been tested assessing its 
catalytic parameters and stability. In order to have a suitable amount of immobilized 
activity on an easily handling amount of solid support, an enzyme support ratio of 
about 290IU/g was used so, with the af oresaid optimized conditions, an 
immobilization yield of about 45% was obtained.  Storage stability of the immobilized laccas e mixture has been moni tored both at room 
temperature and at 4°C and was compared with that obs erved for free laccase 
mixture. Residual activity were determined and expressed as percentages at different 
time intervals. As showed in Fig.5, th e immobilized mixtur e stored at room 
temperature displays about 7 fold increased stability with respect to the free laccase 
mixture (t
1/2 free enzyme=1.6 days; t 1/2 immobilized enzyme=11.6 days); while Fig.4: Immobilization yield versus 
laccase initial activity. ( ―) 
immobilization yield; (---) immobilized 
activity  52stability at 4°C shows t 1/2 increased of about 3 fold (t 1/2 free enzyme=18.5 days; t 1/2 
immobilized enzyme=61 days).        
 
        The enhanced stability of i mmobilized laccase may be due  to the prevention of 
structural rearrangement and to the lower flexibility of immobilized form both caused 
by multipoint attachment to the support [9 ]. Moreover, immobilization can provide an 
artificial micro-environment surrounding th e enzyme that can alter surface-exposed 
hydrophilic and/or charged groups  and their electrostatic interactions and thus 
influencing protein structure and function. In particular, the immobilized enzymes 
were doubly protected by thermal inactivati on thanks to the higher number of positive 
charges on the surface and to the in creased hydrophobicity both provided by 
silanization [10]. To perform a kinetic characterization of t he immobilized biocatalyst, purified laccase 
POXC from P. ostreatus  has been used rather than t he crude mixture.  The purified 
enzyme has been immobilized in the followi ng conditions: 0.2g of activated perlite 
were incubated for 1h with purified POXC solution (50mM Sodium Phosphate buffer, 
pH 6.5, 250IU/g support as initial activity) at room temperature,  resulting in about 
40% immobilization yield (100IU/g support). Kinetic of immobilized POXC against AB TS has been assessed by means of the 
recycling fixed bed reactor, commonly employ ed for activity measurements. Results 
provided K
M=0.44 mM, K cat= 1.2·104 min-1. Comparing these parameters with those 
characteristics of POXC in liquid phase (K M=3.0·10-2 min-1, Kcat= 6.2·105 min-1) both a 
decreased value for K cat and a higher value for K M were found. These differences 
could be a consequence of either the lo ss of conformational integrity of the 
immobilized enzyme or lower accessibility of  substrate to the active sites of the 
immobilized enzyme.  
Adsorption
 
The immobilized system was tested for its de colourisation potentia l against the model 
anthraquinonic dye Remazol Bril liant Blue R (RBBR). First of  all, the phenomenon of 
dye adsorption on carrier surface was inve stigated. Dye adsorpt ion is a fundamental 
aspect to be addressed in assessing dye c onversion by immobili zed enzyme, since 
enzymatic conversion can be masked by rapid adsorption kinetics and large 
adsorbing capacity of the solid  support. Moreover, the adsorption of dyes, as well as 
of their oxidized products, on the imm obilization support ca n lead to enzyme 1.010.0100.0

and at room temperature (B). (Free enzyme     ; Immobilized enzyme     )  53inactivation/inhibition [1]. For these reasons , the main goal of this analysis was to 
quantitatively assess RBBR adsorption on the ac tivated carrier in order to minimize 
any adverse effect on dye conversion.  No adsorption of RBBR was observed on the inert perlite indicating that the 
adsorption phenomenon is re lated to the functional groups resulting from silanization 
or glutaraldehyde activation.  Then, the sample was pr epared adopting the optimal 
conditions defined in the previous secti on. Results revealed about 71mg RBBR/g 
perlite. Enzymatic assays performed after dye saturation showed that immobilized 
laccase activity was completely hindered. 
These findings required proper modification of  the immobilization pr otocol in order to 
limit dye adsorption to a lower value. The effect of several parameters on adsorption 
capacity and immobilization yield was inve stigated. In particu lar, the parameters 
affecting the surface properties of t he support (i.e. APTS concentration and pH, 
temperature, concentration for glutar aldehyde crosslinking) were tuned.  
Results are summarized in Table 2. The ads orption capacity of the silanized perlite 
rises up to 96.1mg/g (A2 in t able 2) with respect to the nu ll adsorption capacity of the 
untreated perlite. As a fact, reducing the APTS concentration form 4 % to 0.4% vol, 
keeping the other conditions constant, t he adsorption capacity was approximately 
halved and an undesired drop of immobilizati on yield was observed. The extent of 
perlite silanization likely determined the conc entration of active  amino groups on the 
carrier surface, a parameter that plays a ke y role in the adsorptio n of the dye. Thus, 
the improvement of the condition for gl utaraldehyde activation would provide a 
reliable solution to saturate the free amino groups available for the interaction with 
the anionic dye. In run A4 two consecutiv e activation steps with glutaraldehyde were 
assessed. However, the adsorption was not significantly affected by this treatment. 
Rising pH from 6.5 up to  8 during glutaraldehyde r eaction provided a further 
decrease of immobilization yield down to 16 .4% together with a negligible effect on 
adsorption capacity (compare A5 with A3). This effect was assessed on carrier 
silanized with 4 or 0.4% APTS solutions (Run A5-A6). Finally, an effective reduction 
of RBBR loading (32.9mg/g), coupled with a satisfying imm obilization yield (51.2%), 
was achieved by incubating the solid silanized with 0.4% APTS with 1% 
glutaraldehyde at pH 8 and 60°C [6]. The la tter operating conditions were selected 
for further investigation of dye degradati on by laccase immobilized on perlite.

   Tab.2: Adsorption capacity of perlite samples obtained in different experimental 
conditions  54Decolourisation experiments  
Decolourisation experiments, aimed at assessing RBBR conversion by immobilized 
laccases, were carried out in a fluidized bed recycle reactor. The choice of the reactor arises from some observations oc curred during prelimin ary decolourisation 
attempt performed in a fixed bed reactor. Fixed bed of inert perlite particles were 
successfully operated on bench scale notwiths tanding considerable pressure drops 
occurred. Unfortunately, when the carrier wa s coated by the immobilized proteins, 
the operation of the reactor was completely hindered by clogging  phenomena (liquid 
phase can not percolate packed bed). 
The fluidized bed was chosen to get round this  constraint. Liquid flow rate required 
for particles fluidization was supplied by t he recirculating stream  while the stream 
containing the dye was c ontinuously supplied at a fl ow rate corresponding to 
residence time suitable for dye conversion. Preliminary decolourisation experiments were carried out employing immobilized 
samples prepared according to two differ ent procedures (C1 and C2 in table 3). 
Samples C1 and C2 exhibit comparable dye adsorption capacities but, they differed 
in the amount of immobilized laccase activi ty. Sample C1 was characterized by an 
initial activity of 10IU/ml, versus 28IU/ml  of sample C2. The reactor was operated 
according to the following conditions. Total liquid volume was set at 71mL. The first 
step of the process consisted of saturati on of the catalyst with the dye. It was 
operated by feeding a dye bearin g liquid stream at 12.4mL/ min without recycling. In 
this phase, particle fluidization was assur ed by the supplied liqu id stream. The space-
time (τ ≅4min) is set so that enzymatic conversion is negligible and solid saturation is 
reached within 2 hours. Once saturation was reached, the dye conversion was 
accomplished lowering inlet flow ra te and introducing the recycle stream (Q

stepwise the liquid feed rate Q keeping Q R at 13 mL/min.   Each step lasted until dye 
concentration in the effluent approached a st eady value. Table 4 reports reactor

 56  The maximum conversion degree, performed with sampl e C1, was 33%, measured 
at a τ=4.6 h. C2 sample provided 56.1% conversion when τ was equal to 4.2 h. 
Decolourisation runs with sample C1 and C2 lasted a bout 80 and 160h with a total 
volume of treated RBBR solution of 3.5L and 4.5L re spectively. Comparing the 
results obtained with samples C1 and C2, it is evid ent that the better performance 
achieved by sample C2 was merely due to the larger amount of immobilized activity 
per volume unit of carrier provided with sample C2.  
It is remarkable to note that, in both decolourisat ion experiments enzyme activity 
decays to about 30% of the initial activity, consis tently with the similar amount of 
adsorbed dye (about 30mg/g carrier) showed by both sample C1 and C2. These 
results allow to confirm that the major biocatalyst  deactivation is related with 
adsorption phenomena (occurring at the same extent for both samples), on the 
contrary the conversion degree (higher for sample C 2) does not influence enzyme 
activity within the time range investigated (about 160h).  
In conclusion, the procedure followed for preparati on of sample C2 (table3), allowed 
to keep satisfactory values of immobilization yield , that mean satisfactory rate of 
decolourisation, and minimize the adsorption capaci ty of the solid biocatalyst. This 
second feature provides the minimum deactivation ex tent related to the initial fast 
adsorption phenomenon. The influence of this phenom enon on the overall 
performance of the bioprocess can be understood obs erving that the deactivation of 
the immobilized enzyme occurring during the dye con version is negligible compared 
with that deriving form dye adsorption. 
 
On the basis of the reported data, it is evident th at further work will be needed to 
assess the applicability of such immobilized system  to dye treatment. Kinetic 
parameters of dye conversion as well as of deactiva tion processes (adsorption-
related and long-term deactivation) should be infer red. This detailed assessment can 
provide the tools for the comparison between the dy e conversion process by means 
of immobilized enzyme and by means the free enzyme in homogeneous system.

FungiSynthetic dyesTextile industry wastewatersabstract
Textile efﬂuents, in addition to high COD, display several problems mainly due to toxicityand recalcitrance of dyestuffs. Innovative technologies effective in removing dyes fromlarge volumes of efﬂuents at low cost and in a timely fashion are needed. Fungi are amongthe most promising organisms for dye biosorption. In this study dye decolourisation, CODand toxicity decrease of three wastewater models after the treatment with inactivatedbiomasses of three Mucorales fungi cultured on two different media were evaluated. Fungalbiomasses displayed good sorption capabilities giving rise to decolourisation percentages
up to 94% and decrease in COD up to 58%. The Lemna minor toxicity test showed a
signiﬁcant reduction of toxicity after biosorption treatments, indicating that decolourisa-tion corresponds to an actual detoxiﬁcation of the treated wastewaters.

1. Introduction
The textile industry plays an important role in the world
economy as well as in our daily life, but at the same time, itconsumes a large quantity of water (up to 150 l of water to dye1 kg of cotton) and generates huge amount of wastewaters(Hai et al., 2007 ).
Water is a rare and precious commodity, and only an
inﬁnitesimal part of the earth’s water reserves (approximately0.03%) constitutes the water resource that is available forhuman activities. The growth of the world’s population andindustry has given rise to a constantly growing demand for
water compared to the supply available, which remains
constant ( Alle`gre et al., 2006 ). On the global level, the question
of the supply of freshwater is becoming more acute every daybecause water is a valuable asset that must be protected. Inthe last decades there has been an increasing concern on theaquatic environment pollution. Coloured textile efﬂuents
contribute enormously to water deterioration and their
treatments (decolourisation and detoxiﬁcation) is the subjectof discussion and regulation in many countries.
Textile efﬂuents are one of the most difﬁcult-to-treat
wastewaters on account of their considerable amount ofsuspended solids and of their high chemical oxygen demand(COD) due to the massive presence of weakly biodegradableand often toxic substances such as additives, detergents,surfactants and dyes. They exhibit large ﬂuctuations in termsof quantities and pollution load, pH and temperaturedepending upon customer orders, types of manufactured
textile materials and production schedules ( Alinsaﬁ et al.,
2006 ;Hai et al., 2007 ).
Given the great variety of ﬁbres, dyes, process aids and
ﬁnishing products in use, dyed wastewaters display a greatchemical complexity and diversity which are not adequatelyARTICLE IN PRESS

E-mail address: cristina.varese@unito.it (G.C. Varese).WATER RESEARCH 42 (2008) 2911– 2920treated in conventional wastewater treatment plants and
therefore dyes and their derivates accumulate in the environ-ment ( Vandevivere et al., 1998 ;Fu and Viraraghavan, 2002 ;
Alinsaﬁ et al., 2006 ). The presence of even trace concentrations
of dyes in efﬂuent is highly visible and undesirable. Actually,the release of coloured wastewater in the ecosystem is aremarkable source of aesthetic pollution, eutrophication andperturbations in aquatic life. Dyed efﬂuents usually containchemicals, including dye itself, that are toxic, carcinogenic,mutagenic or teratogenic to various organisms ( Chen, 2006 ;
Novotny ´e ta l . ,2 0 0 6 ;Mathur and Bhatnagar, 2007 ). Besides, azo
and nitro compounds have been reported to be reduced insediments of aquatic bodies, consequently yielding potentiallycarcinogenic amines that spread in the ecosystem ( Chen, 2006 ;
Hai et al., 2007 ). The presence of dyes or their degradation
products in water even at very low concentrations can alsocause human health disorders such as nausea, haemorrhage,and ulceration of skin and mucous membranes, and can causesevere damage to the kidney, reproductive system, liver, brainand central nervous system ( Oliveira et al., 2007 ).
Toxic substances contained in dyed wastewaters should
therefore be completely removed before being releasedinto the environment. Physical and chemical puriﬁcationmethods, including the advanced oxidation processes(i.e. application of ozone, hydrogen peroxide, and ultraviolet
light, either individually or in combination), are not always
applicable. They always involve high costs and therefore theiruse is restricted in scale of operation and pollution proﬁleof the efﬂuent ( Fu and Viraraghavan, 2001 ;Robinson et al.,
2001 ;Crini, 2006 ;Hai et al., 2007 ) and they are practically
ineffective. Cost competitive biological degradation is usuallyrather ineffective and is limited by the long time required andthe requirement of microorganisms functioning in strictlycontrolled environments ( Hai et al., 2007 ).
Recently, several researches have shown that biosorption
can be regarded as a valid alternative to chemical–physical
methods and to microbial and/or enzymatic biodegradation.
Such researches have pointed out the capacity of variousmicrobial biomasses (bacteria, yeasts, fungi and algae) andwaste materials from industry and agriculture (i.e. pinewood,corncob, bagasse, rice husk, chitosan, etc.) to absorb oraccumulate dyes ( Crini, 2006 ;Ferrero, 2007 ). Among the
various types of biomass, the fungal one has proved to beparticularly suitable. Even if the mechanisms regulatingbiosorption have not yet been fully explained, it seems totake place essentially at the cell wall level ( Aksu, 2005 ;Casieri
2005 ). The main attractions of biosorption are its high
selectivity and efﬁciency, good removal from large volumes
and the potential cost effectiveness. Moreover, both living anddead biomasses can be used to remove hazardous organics;dead cells are obviously preferable for wastewater treatmentsince they are not affected by toxic wastes and chemicals anddo not pollute the environment by releasing toxins and/orpropagules ( Aksu, 2005 ). Actually, among the numerous
techniques of dye removal, biosorption through activatedcarbons or organic resins is the procedure of choice and givesthe best result as it can be used to remove different types ofcolouring materials despite the very high costs that point outthe necessity to ﬁnd alternative, less expensive biosorbent
materials ( Hai et al., 2007 ;Crini, 2008 ).This paper illustrates the decolourisation capacities of the
dead biomasses of three Mucorales fungi as displayed inbatch biosorption experiments, towards three wastewater
models designed to mimic wastes produced during cotton or
wool textile dyeing processes. Biomasses were cultured onone medium with glucose as the carbon source and anotherwith cheaper starch, since the production of biomass forindustrial-scale bioremediation is expensive and the use ofmedia with alternative carbon sources is a desirable objective.The COD measurements and the Lemna minor ecoxicity test
were performed before and after treatments to estimatechange in toxicity of efﬂuents. Since chitosan is consideredone of the most promising dye biosorbents and also the maincell wall component putatively involved in dye biosorption by
Mucorales, we were interested in evaluating the actual
efﬁciency of puriﬁed chitosan in comparison with the wholefungal cell wall. Hence, batch biosorption experiments werealso performed using chitosan from crab shells as biosorbent.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Test organisms and chitosan
Cunninghamella elegans Lendner (MUT 2861), Rhizomucor
pusillus (Lindt) Schipper (MUT 2229) and Rhizopus stolonifer
(Ehrenberg) Vuillemin (MUT 1515) were obtained from theMycotheca Universitatis Taurinensis Collection (MUT, University
of Turin, Department of Plant Biology). Starting cultures werelyophilised and cryopreserved until use. They were revitalisedon Malt Extract Agar, and mature conidia for the inocula andbiomass production were obtained from cultures grown onthe same medium in the dark at 24 1C for 1 week.
Chitosan from crab shells was purchased from Fluka
(St. Luis, MO).
2.2. Dyes and preparation of simulated wastewaters
Three simulated wastewaters, designed to mimic efﬂuentsproduced during cotton or wool textile dyeing processes, wereprepared using mixed industrial dyes at high concentrations.These simulated wastewaters, previously developed by theindustrial partners of the EC FP6 Project SOPHIED (NMP2-CT-2004-505899), were used under the permission of the SOPHIEDConsortium. The industrial dyes used in these experimentswere selected because they are representative of different
structural commercially important dye types, and are widely
applied in textile industry. They are commercial productspurchased from Town End (Leeds, UK) plc., containing inaddition to dye molecules, which constitute 30–90% ofthe total weight other organic molecules as additives. Thechemical–physical properties and chemical formula of thetested dyes are listed in Table 1 . In addition to the dyes, these
simulated wastewaters mimic the industrial ones also for thepresence of different salts, often in high concentrations, andfor the pH values: the ﬁrst wastewater (W1) contained a mixof 3 acid dyes (300 ppm in total), and had an ionic strength of
4.23 /C210
/C02and pH of 5; the second wastewater (W2)
contained a mix of 4 reactive dyes previously hydrolysed(5000 ppm in total), and had an ionic strength of 1.26 /C210

sterilised by tindalisation (three 1 h cycles at 60 1C with 24 h
interval between cycles at room temperature) before use.
2.3. Fungal biomass preparation and batch
biosorption experiments
The two media used for biomass production were EQ (20 g l/C01
glucose, 2 g l/C01ammonium tartrate, 2 g l/C01KH 2PO4, 0.5 g l/C01
MgSO 4/C17H2O, 0.1 g l/C01CaCl 2/C12H2O, 10 ml mineral stock solu-
tion) and ST, in which 18 g l/C01potato starch is used instead of
glucose (Fluka, St. Luis, MO).
Since the literature ( Ellis et al., 1974 ) and preliminary tests
had shown that R. stolonifer cannot use starch as a carbon
source, it was cultured on EQ only.
Each isolate was inoculated as a conidial suspension
(ﬁnal concentration of 1 /C2105conidia ml/C01) in several 500 ml
Erlenmayer ﬂasks containing 300 ml of medium, and incu-bated at 30 1C for 7 days. To avoid production of aerial
mycelium, rich in hydrophobins and poor in adsorbent,
biomasses were cultured in agitated condition at 150 rpmwith a Minitron Infors orbital shaker (Bottmingen, CH). Afterincubation biomasses were collected with a sieve (150 mm
pore), rinsed several times with distilled sterilised water toremove residual medium and then inactivated in a 9 g l
/C01
NaCl solution by autoclaving at 121 1C for 30 min. They were
then collected in sterile conditions and rinsed as alreadydescribed.
Each biomass was weighed and 3 g of biomass fresh weight
or 0.5 g of chitosan dry weight (corresponding to about 3 g of
fungal biomass fresh weight) were placed in 50 ml Erlenmayer
ﬂasks containing 30 ml of simulated wastewaters. The ﬂaskswere incubated at 30 1C in agitated conditions (150 rpm). Eachtrial was performed in triplicate. Simulated wastewaters
without biomass were used as abiotic controls and to assessdecolourisation other than that due to biosorption (e.g.
photobleaching or complexation).
After 2, 6 and 24 h, 300 ml of simulated wastewaters
were taken from each sample, centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for5 min, to remove disturbing mycelial fragments, and exam-ined with a spectrophotometer (Amersham BioscencesUltrospec 3300 Pro, Fairﬁeld, CT) to acquire the completeabsorbance spectra of the efﬂuents and to calculate thepercentage of removed dye (DP, decolourisation percentage)as the extent of decrease of the spectrum area from 360 to790 nm, with respect to that of the abiotic control. Theinﬂuence of the incubation time on the biosorption yield
was assessed from the increase in decolourisation from the
2nd to the 24th hour, calculated as (DP at T24 /C0DP at T2) /C2100/
DP at T24.
At the end of the test the biomasses were ﬁltered on ﬁlter
paper (Whatman type 1), placed in an oven and dried at atemperature of 65 1C for 24 h; then they were weighed and the
dry weight of the fungal biomass was calculated subtractingfrom the dried dyed biomass the amount of the adsorbed dye.The milligrams of adsorbed dye were calculated subtractingthe residual amount of dye at the end of the experiment(obtained by the DP) from the initial amount of dye. It has
thus been possible to calculate sorption capacity (SC) accord-
ing to the following formula:
SC¼mg of removed dye =g of biomass dry weight
The signiﬁcance of differences ( Pp0.05) among the DP
values at 2, 6 and 24 h and among SC values was calculated
with the Mann–Whitney test (SYSTAT 10 for windows SPSS
Inc., 2000).
2.4. COD determination and ecotoxicity test
Determination of COD with the dichromate method wasperformed using HACH (COD High range vials) apparatusaccording to the manufacture’s instructions. A calibrationcurve was obtained using HACH COD standard solution(800 mg O
2l/C01). Appropriate dilutions of each sample were
assayed.
The Lemna minor L. (duckweed) ecotoxicity test was applied
to measure the toxicity of the simulated wastewaters beforeand after the biosorption treatments. The test was performed
in triplicates, in 250 ml glass beakers according to the
standard ISO/WD 20079 in a working volume of 150 ml andwith a sample dilution of 1:10 (ISO 2001). Distilled water wasused as the control in the test.
Ten fronds of L. minor (2 or 3 fronds per colony) of similar
size were used as the inoculum. The test was carried out in aclimatic exposure test cabinet, calibrated at 24 721C, with
ﬂuorescent tubes on top that provided continuous lighting(light intensity, 100 mEs
/C01m/C02) for 7 days.
At the end of the experiment, fronds number and plant dry
weight were used to calculate the growth inhibition ( Imi)b y

3. Results
3.1. Decolourisation
The DP values obtained for the W1, W2 and W3 efﬂuents
are listed in Table 3 . Substantial decolourisation of W1
was nearly always achieved with DPs from 77.2% to 93.9%after 24 h. In all cases, more than 89% of the total decolour-
isation was achieved within 2 h; actually the DP values
obtained with the biomasses of R. pusillus cultivated
on ST and that of R. stolonifer and with chitosan did not
change signiﬁcantly from 2 to 24 h. The DPs for W2 rangedbetween 59.3% and 65.1%; as for W1, in all cases mostof the total decolourisation was reached within 2 h. The DPvalues for W3 obtained by fungal biomasses were quite high,ranging from 84.0% and 92.7%, whereas the performance ofchitosan was considerably lower (42.9%); in comparison withthe other simulated efﬂuents, lower percentage of the totaldecolourisation was attained within 2 h and in all cases a
signiﬁcant increase of the DP values among 2, 6 and 24 h was
observed.
The SC values of the fungal biomasses and chitosan
towards the W1, W2 and W3 efﬂuents are shown in Table 4 .
All the fungal biomasses and chitosan signiﬁcantly increasedtheir SC passing from W1 to W2 and W3. The highest SCswere displayed by fungal biomasses towards W3, with valuesalways higher than 200 mg of dye g
/C01of biomass dry weight.
Chitosan displayed signiﬁcantly lower SCs vs W1 and W3 withrespect to the fungal biomasses. The medium compositionsigniﬁcantly affected the SC of the fungal biomasses in 3
cases: R. pusillus vs W1, when the fungus was cultured on EQ
proved higher SC than when cultured on ST, and C. elegans vs
W2 and W3, when the fungus was cultured on ST improvedSC in comparison with EQ.
Absorbance spectra during the biosorption experiments
show that the fungal biomasses display high afﬁnities for alldyes. The fungal biomasses adsorbed the dyes present in the3 wastewaters with comparable speed irrespective of theirformulas as shown by the absence of modiﬁcations in theshape of the absorbance spectra ( Fig. 1 ).
3.2. COD
The COD (mg l/C01) values for W1, W2 and W3 before
(controls) and after the treatment by the biomasses arelisted in Table 5 . In most cases a signiﬁcant decrease in COD
was observed. In two cases ( C. elegans and R. pusillus
cultivated on EQ vs W1) the COD values increased after thetreatment.
3.3. Ecotoxicity test
The growth inhibition percentages measured by frondsnumber and plant dry weight before and after the treatmentby the fungal biomasses are reported in Fig. 2 . After
the treatment the toxicity of the efﬂuents always decreased.In detail, the treatment of W1 by the fungal biomasses
caused a decrease, even if not signiﬁcant, of the growth
inhibition measured both as fronds number and dryweight; in all cases L. minor resulted even in biostimulation
by the treated wastewaters. The toxicity of W2 after thetreatment was always signiﬁcantly lower, considering thefronds number and in one case ( R. pusillus cultivated
on ST) considering the dry weight. The toxicity of W3 wasalways signiﬁcantly lower after the treatment, with theonly exception of R. pusillus cultivated on ST considering the
dry weight.
4. Discussion
These results show that biosorption treatment by C. elegans ,R.
pusillus and R. stolonifer biomasses determine a substantial
and rapid decolourisation of the 3 tested efﬂuents. Very highDPs that resulted in changes in the appearance of theefﬂuents reducing the strong initial visual impact, wereobtained with W1 (up to 94%) and W3 (up to 93%). Good yieldof decolourisation (up to 65%) was also achieved with the
more concentrated W2 (5000 ppm). Chitosan was generally
less effective than the fungal biomasses, and this is particu-larly true towards W3. Calculation of the increase indecolourisation and monitoring of the decrease in absorbanceshowed that in nearly all cases the maximum biosorptiontowards W1 and W2 was reached in the ﬁrst 2 h, while thedecolourisation of W3 proved to be a slower process, sincelower percentage of the total decolourisation was attainedwithin 2 h.
Moreover, the absence of modiﬁcations in the shape of the
absorbance spectra during the biosorption experiments
demonstrates that the biomasses removed with comparable
efﬁciency all the dyes present in the same efﬂuent, irrespec-tive of the chromophore (mono-, bi- tri-, poliazoic, anthra-quinonic or stilbenic), steric conformation, charge andmolecular weight.
The versatility and efﬁciency of the tested biomasses,
previously proved towards single dyes and a mix of ten dyes(Prigione et al., 2008 ), in this study were conﬁrmed also
working with efﬂuents designed to mimic wastewatersproduced during cotton or wool dyeing processes. The addedvalue of these results stems from the fact that these waste-
waters, prepared using mixed commercially important in-
dustrial dyes, contain high concentration of salts and displaydifferent pH values, introducing real parameters that oftenbars the attainment of good biosorption yields ( Aksu, 2005 ). It
must be borne in mind that till now, most of the dataconcerning the exploitation of fungal biomasses in dyebiosorption are about single molecules at low concentrations;only few studies with multicomponent dye solutions and highsalt concentration, which simulate dye-house or textile-millefﬂuents have been carried out ( Aksu, 2005 ;Prigione et al.,
2008 ).
The SC of a biomass depends on several biotic and abiotic
factors, such as the type of biomass (species, age), the type ofsorbates, the presence of other competing ions and theARTICLE IN PRESS
WATER RESEARCH 42 (2008) 2911– 2920 2915method of biomass preparation, along with several physi-
cal–chemical factors such as temperature, pH, ionic concen-tration ( Maurya et al., 2006 ). According to Aksu (2005) , higher
concentration of dyes may enhance the adsorption process byproviding an important driving force to overcome the mass
transfer resistance of the dye between the aqueous and solid
phases. This is only partially true in our experiments. In fact,all the biomasses increased their SC passing from W1
(300 ppm) to W2 and W3 (5000 and 3000 ppm, respectively);however, the highest SC values have been recorded towardsW3 (3000 ppm) and not towards W2 (5000 ppm). Probably,at very high concentration, dye–dye interactions become
prevalent and this may result in decreased afﬁnity of the
dye binding sites on the biomass, as suggested by BustardARTICLE IN PRESS

*Signiﬁcant differences between the SC of a species cultured on different media.WATER RESEARCH 42 (2008) 2911– 2920 2916et al. (1998) ; besides other abiotic factors, i.e. ionic strength
and pH, can play an important role. According to Shu et al.
(2005) higher concentrations of dyes and/or salts promote the
dye aggregation that, in turn, decrease the available ionicgroups of the dye molecules, decreasing their solubility andtheir possibility to interact with the fungal biomass. More-
over, biosorption is also inﬂuenced by the structure of the dye
molecules ( Prigione et al., 2008 ). In our case, direct dyes were
more easily removed than reactive dyes. This could be due todifferent steric conformations and charge distribution of thedye molecules that affect the interaction between thebiomass binding sites and the dyes.
Finally, the inﬂuence of growing medium (EQ vs ST) was
considered. It has been reported on several occasions that thecell wall of fungi responds to the culture medium and otherphysical–chemical properties of the environment by greatlychanging its composition and chemical–physical properties
(El-Mougith, 1999 ;Hefnawy et al., 1999 ;Nemcovic and Farkas,
1998 ;Znidarsic et al., 1999 ). Biomasses cultured on media
containing starch as C source showed signiﬁcantly higher SCswith respect to the biomasses cultured on glucose in twocases ( C. elegans vs W2 and W3), whereas R. pusillus displayed
signiﬁcantly higher SC towards W1 when cultured in EQ.These results are of great signiﬁcance for the application ofthe biosorption method to industry, since starch is a low-costby-product of many manufacturing processes whose use as Csource would reduce the generally very expensive production
of biomasses.
Chitosan, the other biosorbent tested in our experiments, is
an important by-product of the food industry, generallyconsidered highly effective in biosorption ( Crini, 2006 ). Be-
sides, it is a characteristic component of the cell wall ofMucorales (where its content may exceed that of chitin), oftenindicated as the main responsible for dye biosorption by thisgroup of fungi. The comparison between the SCs of fungalbiomasses and those of chitosan point out two importantresults: (i) the selected biomasses are more efﬁcient thanpuriﬁed chitosan in dye removal, especially towards efﬂuents
containing acid or direct dyes; (ii) other fungal cell wall
components, in addition to chitosan, seem to play anessential role in biosorption process. Hence, further studieswill be addressed to the understanding of the biosorptionARTICLE IN PRESS

groups involved.
Despite the difﬁculties in comparing the SCs of various
biosorbents, mainly due to the different experimental condi-tions (i.e. type of dye, biomass conditions, mathematicalapproach for the calculation of SC, etc.), our results conﬁrmthe high biosorption yields of the tested biomasses comparedwith other microbial biomasses (i.e. bacteria, yeasts andalgae), as well as waste materials and by-products derivingfrom industry and agriculture (i.e. pinewood, corncob, ba-
gasse, rice husk, chitosan, etc.), and mineral sorbents (i.e.
dolomite, bentonite, zeolite, etc.) ( Aksu, 2005 ;Crini, 2006,
2008 ;Ferrero 2007 ). Fungal biomasses, hence, can be con-
sidered very promising candidates for the replacement ofactivated carbons and organic resins, which have ensuredtheir primacy for dye removal from industrial wastewatersdue to their versatility and efﬁciency, but with importantdrawbacks (such as the high costs) hampering their use onlarge scale ( Aksu, 2005 ;Crini, 2008 ).
The three mimmicked wastewaters displayed COD values
from 443 to 2724 mg l
/C01conﬁrming the high chemical oxygen
demand generally pointed out by the literature for dyed
efﬂuents ( Solmaz et al., 2006 ). In all cases, COD values
exceeded the legal threshold value (160 mg l/C01) of the Italian
law (D.Lgs. 3 aprile 2006, n. 152). In most cases a signiﬁcantdecrease in COD, although not proportional to DP, wasobtained after the biosorption treatment. This datum couldbe explained by the preferential dye biosorption with respectto the organic molecules and/or by the release of organicmatter from the fungal biomasses. This last phenomenon canalso explain the increase of COD recorded in 2 cases. Therelease of organic matter from the biomasses was conﬁrmed
measuring a COD increase in experiments where the fungalbiomasses were incubated in the same simulated efﬂuents
without dyes (data not shown). This datum shows that caremust be taken in the rinsing during biomass preparationto remove accurately the residual medium and/or thecytoplasmatic content from the inactivated biomasses. Toour knowledge this is the ﬁrst report of COD monitoring inbiosorption experiments. Actually, this parameter is particu-larly important since in the commercial products in additionto dyes many other molecules, i.e. additives and surfactants,are present which constitute up to 70% of the ﬁnal dry weight
and the removal of these molecules cannot be monitored by
the efﬂuent decolourisation.
The L. minor ecoxicity test has been often employed to
assess the toxicity of several organic compounds, in parti-cular it presents high sensitivity for dye-containing samples(Lytle and Lytle, 2001 ;Trivedi et al., 2004 ;Okay et al., 2005 ;
Casieri et al., 2008 ). The test showed a signiﬁcant reduction of
toxicity after biosorption treatments, indicating that deco-lourisation corresponds to an actual detoxiﬁcation of thetreated wastewaters irrespective of the decrease of COD. Thislast datum indicates that the release of the organic matter
from the fungal biomasses does not impact on the toxicity.
Although decolorisation is not always coupled to detox-
iﬁcation, as already demonstrated by several papers dealingwith chemical–physical treatments (i.e. ultrasound andphotochemical treatment) and biological degradationmainly of azo dyes ( Vandevivere et al., 1998 ;Husain, 2006 ;
Hai et al., 2007 ), detoxiﬁcation of true or simulated industrial
efﬂuents by means of ecotoxicity tests has been veriﬁed inonly very few studies ( Gottlieb et al., 2003 ;Malachova ´et al.,
2006 ). In decolorisation experiments, hence, the efﬂuent
toxicity before and after the treatment should be always
monitored.ARTICLE IN PRESS

In conclusion, biosorption by means of fungal biomasses
could be really considered a valid alternative to othertechniques for wastewater treatment aiming at water reuse,in terms of initial cost, ﬂexibility and simplicity of design,ease of operation and insensitivity to toxic pollutants.
The biomasses of Cunninghamella elegans ,Rhizomucor
pusillus and Rizopus stolonifer seem to be very fast and effec-tive in removing dyes characterized by different structu-
res and/or different chemical reactivities irrespectiveof the composition of the wastewaters, exceeding in thisway many drawbacks of biodegradation. Decolouri-sation corresponds to a substantial detoxiﬁcation of waste-waters and is usually coupled to a signiﬁcant decreaseof COD.
The three selected biomasses can be regarded as powerful
candidates for biotechnology of dye biosorption due to their
high ability to remove industrial mixed dyes in highARTICLE IN PRESS

The work described in Section1 has been ai med at evaluating the performances of 
several biological options for wastewater  treatment. Two kind of processes have 
been specifically analysed: Biodegradation-based processe s and Biosorption-based 
processes. In particular, the former alte rnative has been explored  from a multiplicity 
of perspectives (whole-cell  and enzymatic processes in free an immobilized forms).  Together with the powerful and promising resu lts achievable by the application of the 
analysed biosystems, some constraints pos ed by each specific bioprocess have to 
be highlighted. Cost compet itive biodegradation processe s proved to be limited by 
the harsh conditions provided by the wastew aters (neither of the treatments was 
effective on Reactive model, for instance), and were often characterized by long process time (up to seven days of treatment  for Direct model). Moreover, the tested 
microorganisms exhibited diffe rent decolourisation specificities, leading to the 
conclusion that a single st rain/enzyme may be not suffici ent to meet the highly 
variable nature of textile effluents, since t here are too many fact ors that may affect 
the biodegradation rate of dy es (substrate specificity, pH and salt concentration). 
Thus, further work in this direction shou ld be done by testing the performances of 
microbial consortia and enzymatic mixtures fr om different sources in order to exploit 
their potential synergistic effect.  On the other hand, biosorption based proc esses proved to be fast and effective in 
removing dyes characterized by different c hemical reactivities, irrespective of the 
composition of the wastewat ers. However, they pose t he problem of disposal of 
spent biomasses. Taken together, these observations indica te that each process alone might not 
represent a universally applicable solution to wastewater treatment. Combination of 
different techniques are generally required to devise a technically and economically 
feasible option. In light of this, the current resear ch should be focused on both 
improving each single solution, as well  as on proposing a wide range of hybrid 
decolourisation techniques in which the respective advantages of each methods 
would be exploited. A comprehensive survey of potential combinati ons of different kind of processes was 
given by Hai and co-workers (see referenc es chapter 3). The wide range of hybrid 
techniques proposed include chemical-biological, biol ogical-chemical, chemical-
physical, chemical-chemical as well as others alternatives.  An effective combined process for wast ewater treatment could be developed as 
follows. The rapid wastewater  decolourisation achievable by fungal biosorption may 
be followed by the physical treatment of the treated effluent. Such type of methods 
(i.e. nanofiltration, reverse osmosis) would be, in fact, much more cost-effective if 
applied on effluents with a low polluting lo ad, producing purifi ed water and allowing 
the reuse of water along with mineral salt s. Subsequently, the spent biomasses may 
be treated by chemical oxid ation methods or biodegradat ion processes to remove 
dye molecules. Solid state fermentation ( SSF) of such biomasses by fungal strains 
could be exploited, for example, result ing in simultaneously dye degradation and 
enriching the nutritional q uality of the solid substrat es. Finally, these exhausted 
biomasses could be addressed to compos ting or biogas and energy productions, 
whilst the possible exhaus ted effluents deriving from  this process may undergo 
conventional treatment by active sludge in order to reduce their COD loading. 
  69Thus, the results provided by this secti on can be regarded as a preliminary key step 
in designing such combined approaches. However, further efforts will be required to confirm the results obtained on model wast ewaters, by testing their potential 
application on real indu strial wastewaters.  70

cations. The existence of a laccase gene clustering was
demonstrated in this basidiomycete fungus, and three new
laccase genes were cloned, taking advantage of their
closely related spatial organization on the fungus genome.
cDNAs coding for two of the new laccases were isolated
and expressed in the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae  and
Kluyveromyces lactis , in order to optimize their production
and to characterize th e recombinant proteins . Analysis of
the P. ostreatus  laccase gene family allowed the identi Wca-
tion of a “laccase subfamily” consisting of three genes.
A peculiar intron–exon structur e was revealed for the gene
of one of the new laccases, along with a high instability of
the recombinant enzyme due to lability of its copper ligand.
This study allowed enlarging the assortment of P. ostreatus
laccases and increasing knowledge to improve laccase
production.Keywords Laccase gene · Fungus ·

Introduction
Laccases are copper-containing polyphenol oxidases (EC
1\10\3\2), that have been found in fungi (Hatakka 1994 ),
in plants (Mayer 1987 ; Mayer and Staples 2002 ) and in
bacteria (Diamantidis et al. 2000 ; Hullo et al. 2001 ;
Sanchez-Amat et al. 2001 ; Roberts et al. 2002 ; Enguita
et al. 2003 ). These enzymes are, generally, monomeric,
or, more rarely, homo- and hetero-dimeric or homo-tetra-
meric glyco-proteins, whose activity is dependent on four
copper ions, distributed among three di Verent highly con-
served binding sites (Thurston 1994 ; Hoegger et al. 2006 ).
Laccases are able of oxidizing a wide range of aromatic
compounds, with concomitant reduction of molecular
oxygen to water (Thurston 1994 ; Ullah et al. 2000 ).
Thanks to their low substrate speci Wcity, laccases can be
used for several industrial applications, such as pulp
bleaching in paper industry, textile dye decolorization and
detoxiWcation of environmental pollutants (Mayer and
Staples 2002 ). For these applications, the most suitable
laccase for each speci Wc purpose should be found and pro-
duced. Therefore, many e Vorts are being focused on
molecular characterization of fungal laccases as well as
on improvement of the production levels by recombinant
expression.
It has been reported that almost all the fungi examined
secrete more than one laccase isozyme (Yaver et al. 1996 ;
Yaver and Golightly 1996 ; Mansur et al. 1998 ; Soden and
Dobson 2001 ; Hoshida et al. 2001 ; Palmieri et al. 2003 ;
RodrÂguez et al. 2008 ). Even if a low similarity is revealedCommunicated by Ursula Kües.

LE /handv TYPESET /handv CP /handok DISK /handokamong some deduced laccase amino acid sequences, all lac-
cases share the four copper-binding regions, as well as the
highly conserved copper ligands 10 histidine and 1 cysteine
residues (Thurston 1994 ).
Expression of di Verent patterns of laccase isozymes
coded by gene families is di Verentially regulated,
depending on the growth conditions (Bollag and Leono-
wicz 1984 ; Rogalski and Leonowicz 1992 ) and physio-
logical states (Mansur et al. 1998 ; Rogalski et al. 1993 ).
Several studies indicated that the expression of most
fungal laccase genes is a Vected by metal ions, such as
copper and cadmium (Palmieri et al. 2000 ; Baldrian and
Gabriel 2002 ), and by aromatic compounds (Galhaup
et al. 2002 ).
The laccase family of the basidiomycete fungus Pleuro-
tus ostreatus  represents a variegated group of enzymes,
some of which are endowed with peculiar properties.
Besides the typical laccase isoenzyme POXC (Giardina
et al. 1996 ), representing the most abundantly produced
laccase from P. ostreatus , the fungus excretes the white lac-
case isoenzyme POXA1w, having a singular metal content
(Palmieri et al. 1997 ), the heterodimeric laccase isoenzyme
POXA3 (Palmieri et al. 2003 ; Giardina et al. 2007 ; Faraco
et al. 2008a ) and POXA1b, the notably stable at alkaline
pH, with a t1/2 of 30 days at pH 10 (Giardina et al. 1999 ).
Studies of the genes coding for laccase isoenzymes in
P. ostreatus  have so far led to the identi Wcation of four
diVerent genes and the corresponding cDNAs, poxc  (previ-
ously named pox2 ) (Giardina et al. 1996 ), pox1  (coding for
a laccase isoenzyme not yet identi Wed) (Giardina et al.
1995 ), poxa1b  (Giardina et al. 1999 ), and poxa3  (Palmieri
et al. 2003 ). Chromosomal location of the known laccase
genes from P. ostreatus  has been only partly investigated
so far. Linkage analysis mapped both poxc  and pox1  on the
distal end of chromosome VI at 5.1 centimorgans distance
(Larraya et al. 2000 ).
The peculiar molecular aspects of P. ostreatus  laccase
isoenzymes along with their role in biotechnological
applications of the fungus (Palmieri et al. 2005a , b;
Faraco et al. 2008b , c) led us to further investigate the lac-
case family of P. ostreatus . The aim of this work was
identiWcation and characterization of new P. ostreatus
laccases, in order to enlarge the assortment of these indus-
trially useful enzymes. Three new laccase genes from
P. ostreatus  were cloned, thus enlarging the panel of these
biocatalysts up to seven members . A “laccase subfamily”
consisting of three laccase genes was identi Wed, whilst a
divergent intron–exon structure was revealed for the gene
of one of the new laccases. Recombinant heterologous
expression of one of the new laccases was also success-
fully performed and conditions to reconstitute the
extremely instable enzymatic activity by copper addition
were deWned.Materials and methods
Strains, media, and plasmids
Pleurotus ostreatus  (Jacq.:Fr.) Kummer (type: Florida)
(ATCC no. MYA-2306) liquid cultures were carried out in
2.4% potato dextrose broth in the presence of 0.5% yeast
extract, supplemented when indicated with 150- /afii9839M copper
sulphate with or without 2-mM ferulic acid. About 50 ml of
a 5-day-old culture were transferred in 1-l Xasks containing
450 ml broth at 28°C in the dark.
The Escherichia coli  strain Top 10 ( F-mcrA D  (mrrhs-
dRMS-mcrBC ) f80lacZDM15 DlacX74 deoR recA1araD139
D (ara-leu ) 7697 galU galK rpsL  (StrR) endA1 nupG ) was
used in all DNA manipulations. E. coli  was grown in Luria-
Bertani (LB) medium (10 g l¡1 bacto tryptone, 10 g l¡1 NaCl,
5gl¡1 yeast extract), supplemented, when required, with
100/afii9839gm l¡1 of ampicillin.
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae  strain used for heterolo-
gous expression was W303-1A ( MATade2-1, his3-11, 15,
leu2-3, 112, trp1-1, ura3-1, can1-100 ). The plasmid used
for S. cerevisiae  expression was pSAL4 (copper-inducible
CUP1 promoter) carrying URA3  gene for auxotrophic
selection. S. cerevisiae  was grown on the selective medium
[6.7 g l¡1 yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and
ammonium sulphate, 5 g l¡1 casamino acids, 30 mg l¡1
adenine, 40 mg l¡1 tryptophan, 50 mM succinate bu Ver (pH
5.3), 20 g l¡1 glucose], named SD medium.
The Kluyveromyces lactis  strain used for heterologous
expression was CMK5 (a thr lys pgi1 adh3 adh1URA3
adh2URA3 ). The plasmid used for K. lactis  expression,
pYG132 (Piscitelli et al. 2005 ) contains an ethanol-induc-
ible 1,200-nucleotides extended KlADH4  promoter
(Mazzoni et al. 1992 ) and the S. cerevisiae  phosphoglyc-
erate kinase terminator. K. lactis  was grown in YPPG
m e d i u m  ( 1 0gl¡1 yeast extract, 40 g l¡1 bacto tryptone,
2 0gl¡1 glucose), supplemented with ethanol (0.5%),
CuSO4 (0.1 mM) and when required, with 100 /afii9839gm l¡1 of
geneticin G418.
Genomic DNA isolation and Southern analysis
Genomic DNA from P. ostreatus  was isolated (Raeder
and Broda 1988 ), digested with several restriction
enzymes (Promega, Italy), and, after electrophoresis on
0.8% agarose gel, transferred to a Hybond-NX nylon
membrane (GE Healthcare). The membrane was hybrid-
ized using the laccase cDNAs poxc  (GenBank accession
number Z34848 ), pox1  (GenBank accession number
Z34847 ), poxa1b  (GenBank accession number AJ005018 )
and poxa3  (EMBL accession number AJ344434 ) as radio-
active probes, as previously described (Palmieri et al.
2000 ).60

LE /handv TYPESET /handv CP /handok DISK /handokIsolation and sequencing of genes
A BAC (Bacterial Arti Wcial Chromosome) library of the
P. ostreatus  genome was kindly made available by Prof
Ramírez of Department of Agrarian Production, Public
University of Navarre. The library, consisting of 150-kDa
DNA fragments, was screened using poxc, pox1 , poxa1b  and
poxa3  cDNAs as probes. cDNAs were ampli Wed and labelled
by polymerization chain reaction (PCR) with dUTP digoxi-
genin conjugated, following manufacturer’s instructions
(Roche Applied Science). The screening was performed at
68°C in the bu Ver 5£SSC, 0.5% SDS, 1 mM EDTA (where
1£SSC is 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate). The blots
were washed at the same temperature; the Wnal wash was
performed in 0.1 £SSC, 0.1% SDS. Detection was per-
formed by using DIG nucleic acid detection kit (Roche
Applied Science), following manufacturer’s instructions.
The positive bacterial clones were analyzed by PCR by
means of Phusion polymerase (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, using both speci Wc oligonucle-
otides, designed on poxc , pox1 , poxa1b  and poxa3  cDNAs,
and degenerate oligonucleotides, corresponding to consen-
sus sequences of laccase copper-binding regions (Table 1),
at the annealing temperatures reported in Table 1. The
degenerate primers POXfw and POXrev were designed on
the highly conserved copper-binding regions I (HWHG-
FFQ) and II (YHSHL) of POXC. Sequencing of PCR prod-
ucts was performed by PRIMM Sequencing Service
(Milan, Italy) by using the dideoxy chain-termination
method and speci Wc oligonucleotide primers.A sub-library of the positive BAC clone I24 was pre-
pared by EcoRI partial digestion, giving »6,000-bp
extended fragments that we re cloned in the plasmid
pGEM3Zf (Promega, Italy). DNA plasmids from 80 inde-
pendent clones were UV-linked to a Hybond-NX nylon
membrane (GE Healthcare). Th e blots were hybridized at
70°C in the bu Ver 0.5 M sodium phosphate, 7% SDS,
1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) and washed at the same temperature;
the Wnal wash was performed with 0.1 £SSC, 0.5% SDS.
The sub-library was screened by using as probes the
cDNAs poxc , poxa1b, pox1  and poxa3 , labelled with
[/afii9825-32P]dATP (GE Healthcare) by random priming with a
labelling kit (GE Healthcare). DNA preparation and restric-
tion analyses were performed by standard methods accord-
ing to Sambrook et al . (1989 ). Sequencing by PRIMM was
performed using universal and speci Wc oligonucleotide
primers.
Isolation and sequencing of cDNAs
Total RNAs were extracted from lyophilized mycelia, by
using QIAGEN RNeasy Plant (QIAGEN, Italy), and fol-
lowing manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription
reaction was performed using Super Script II Rnase
H-Reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
and the oligonucleotide dT-NotI as primer. Products of the
PCR experiments, performed using the gene-speci Wc oligo-
nucleotides (Table 1), were cloned into the p-GEM-T Easy
Vector (Promega, Italy). D NA preparation was performed
by standard methods (Sambrook et al. 1989 ). Sequencing

versal and speci Wc oligonucleotide primers.
Analysis of gene sequences
Positions of the ATG start codons and introns in the newly
identiWed laccase genes were predicted from conserved
intron positions, by alignment of deduced protein
sequences with those of the previously de Wned P. ostreatus
laccases and by comparison with the conserved sequences
of intron splice junctions. Sequences of pox3 , pox4  and
pox5  genes and pox3  and pox4  cDNAs were submitted to
EMBL Data Library and the assigned accession numbers
were FM202669 , FM202670 , FM202671 , FM202672 , and
FM202673 , respectively.
Alignments of DNA and deduced amino acid sequences
were generated with ClustalW2 ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/
Tools/ clustalw2/index.html ). Signal peptides were pre-
dicted with SignalP V2.0 ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ ).
N-glycosylation sites (Asn-XXX-Ser/Thr) were identi Wed
with NetNGlyc 1.0 server ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/
NetNGlyc/ ). The conservation scoring among the laccase
signature sequences was performed by PRALINE ( http://
zeus.cs.vu.nl/programs/pralinewww/ ).
Phylogenetic analysis was carried out on P. ostretaus
laccases using basidiomycete laccase sequences reported in
Hoegger et al. ( 2006 ). These sequences, together with the
newly isolated laccases, were aligned with ClustalW using
default settings for multiple sequence alignments. Based on
this alignment, a neighbor joining tree was constructed
using MEGA version 4 (Tamura et al. 2007). Bootstrapping
was carried out with 500 replications.
Vector construction for heterologous expression in yeasts
pox3  and pox4  cDNAs were ampli Wed (Phusion polymer-
ase, Invitrogen) with HEFwpox3/BHRevpox3 and HEFw-
pox4/BHRevpox4 primers (Table 1), using as templates
p-GEM-T Easy Vectors containing pox3  or pox4  cDNA,
respectively, in order to insert restriction sites required for
cloning in expression vectors. The PCR products were
cloned in EcoRI-BamHI digested pUC18 plasmid and
checked by sequencing at PRIMM Sequencing Service.
cDNAs, including signal peptides, were recovered by Hin-
dIII or EcoR I-HindIII hydrolysis and cloned in pYG132 or
pSAL4, respectively.
Yeast transformation, cultivation and laccase production
Kluyveromyces lactis  transformation by electroporation,
selection of transformed clones on agar plates and screen-
ing of selected clones for laccase production (in YPPD
medium containing 100 /afii9839gm l¡1 geneticin and supple-mented with 0.1 mM CuSO4 and 2% ethanol) were per-
formed as previously described (Piscitelli et al. 2005 ). To
study laccase production, the best producing clones were
grown in 250-ml Xasks containing 50 ml of selective YPPD
medium, starting from 0.06 OD600. Cultures were grown at
28°C on a rotary shaker.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae  transformation was done by
using a lithium acetate protocol (Gietz et al. 1992 ). The
cells were spread on the selective medium and the plates
incubated upside down for 4 days at 28°C. Laccase produc-
tion by transformants was Wrst assayed on SD plates sup-
plemented with 0.6 mM CuSO4 and 0.2 mM ABTS or
0.1 mM DMP. Inocula grown on selective SD medium
were used to seed Xasks (250 ml) containing 50 ml of selec-
tive medium, starting from 0.5 OD600. Cultures were
grown at 28°C on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm.
Protein puriWcation
Preparative cultures of pox3  transformants of S. cerevisiae
were performed in 1-l Xasks containing 200 ml of SD
medium. Culture media were harvested at about the optimal
laccase production time, cells were sedimented by centrifu-
gation at 1,600 g at 4°C for 15 min. S ecreted proteins were
Wltered through Whatmann sheet. The sample was concen-
trated using Amicon stirred cells with PM30 ultra Wltration
membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA), after addition of
2m M  C u S O4. Then the sample was equilibrated in 50 mM
MES pH 5.5, 20% glycerol and loaded onto a High Load
16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade (GE healthcare Bio-Sci-
ences, AB, Uppsala, Sweden) column equilibrated in the
same buVer. The active fractions were pooled and concen-
trated on an Amicon PM-30 membrane.
Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-
Rad Protein Assay (BioRad), with bovine serum albumin as
standard.
Phenol oxidase activity was assayed at 25°C using
2,2/H11032-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)
(ABTS) and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP) as substrates, as
previously described (Palmieri et al. 1997 ). Enzyme activ-
ity was expressed in IU.
Homology modelling
The 3D-structure of POX3 was modelled selecting as tem-
plate the crystal structure of Trametes versicolor  (1GYC
pdb entry) (Piontek et al. 2002 ), that shares 73% sequence
identity with POX3. Aminoacid sequence alignment was
generated by using the T-co Vee programm that uses the
Lalign algorithm from the FASTA package.
Several sets of models were generated, for each system,
by using the program MODELLER 8v2 (Marti-Renom
et al. 2000 ) In this program, the models are generated by219

Results
Isolation of new members of Pleurotus ostreatus  laccase 
gene family
Southern blot experiments using both XhoI and SacI
digested P. ostreatus  genomic DNAs showed that pox1  and
poxa3  genes are localized in the same 8.5-kb XhoI
fragment, while pox1  and poxa1b  hybridized with the same
10-kb SacI fragment (data not shown).
In order to investigate the chromosomal organization of
the P. ostreatus  laccase gene family, a library of the fungal
genome in BAC (bacterial arti Wcial chromosome) clones
(made available by Prof Ramírez of Department of Agrar-
ian Production, Public Univers ity of Navarre) was screened
by colony hybridization using poxc , pox1 , poxa1b  and
poxa3  cDNAs as probes . Two BAC clones were selected,
the clone C19 hybridizing with poxa3  cDNA and the clone
I24 with all the probes. Sequencing of PCR products ampli-
Wed on these clones with speci Wc oligonucleotides designed
on poxc , poxa1b , poxa3  and pox1  genes showed presence
of all these genes in the I24 clone and of poxa3  gene in the
C19 clone.
To identify new members of the P. ostreatus  laccase
gene family, PCR analyses on the BAC clones I24 and C19
were performed using degenerate oligonucleotides
(Table 1), corresponding to the highly conserved copper-
binding regions I and II of poxc  gene, taking advantage of
the high degree of similarity shared among laccase genes
(D’Souza et al. 1996 ). PCR products of two di Verent sizes
(250 and 300 bp) were obtained from the clone I24,
whereas only one 250-bp fragment was ampli Wed from the
clone C19. Sequence analyses showed that the clone I24
contains at least one new putative laccase gene, named
pox4 , in addition to the already known laccase genes. The
entire DNA sequence of pox4  (3,297 bp including 590 bp
of 5/H11032 and 130 bp of 3 /H11032 non-coding regions) was determined
by walking on the clone I24. The pox4  gene proved to share
63 and 64% of identity with the pox1  and poxc  genes,
respectively.Further investigations were performed on the clone I24,
since the veriWed presence of at least Wve laccase genes in
this clone strengthen the hypothesis of a clustered organiza-
tion of these genes. A sub-library of the clone I24 was pre-
pared and screened. A clone containing a »7,000-bp
fragment, hybridizing with all the probes poxc , poxa1b,
pox1  and poxa3  cDNAs, was selected. By complete
sequencing of this genomic fragment, two new putative lac-
case genes, named pox3  and pox5 , were found. The com-
plete pox3  gene sequence (4,400 bp including 1,400 bp of
5/H11032 and 800 bp of 3 /H11032 non-coding regions) was determined on
this fragment, being the gene entirely contained in the sub-
clone. On the other hand, pox5  gene is only partially con-
tained in this fragment, and to complete its sequence
(2,837 bp), sequencing on the clone I24 was required. pox3
and pox5  genes proved to have a tail to tail arrangement,
with an opposite transcription orientation and a 800 bp dis-
tance between them. Despite their closeness, which could
suggest a recent event of gene duplication, the pox3  and
pox5  gene sequences proved to be quite divergent, sharing
only 38% of identity.
Isolation of new laccase cDNAs, analyses 
of gene structures and of deduced protein sequences
Expression of the three new putative laccase genes pox3 ,
pox4  and pox5  in P. ostreatus  was assessed by means of
reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR experiments with gene-spe-
ciWc primers (Table 1). Analyses were performed on 7-day-
old fungus grown with or without addition of 150 /afii9839M
CuSO4 or 150 /afii9839M CuSO4 plus 2 mM ferulic acid. pox3
and pox4  mature transcripts were isolated, while no RNA
species coding for pox5  could be detected in any tested
conditions.
pox3  proved to be expressed in  all the analyzed culture
conditions. The isolated pox3  cDNA covers 1,569 bp,
including an opening reading frame coding for a 501 aa
long polypeptide. In all tested conditions two pox3  cDNAs
were isolated di Vering for only one nucleotide (at the posi-
tion 1690 of the entered EMBL sequence), giving the
aminoacidic substitution Ser/Ala at position 301 of the
deduced proteins (POX3/Ser and POX3/Ala). The pox3
coding sequence is interrupted by ten introns. An altered
pox3  transcript, due to missing excision of the intron IV
and leading to an early stop in  translation, was also ampli-
Wed in the copper/ferulic acid growth condition. All the
splicing junctions of pox3  introns adhere to the GT-AG rule
and most of the internal lariat  sites are conform to the con-
sensus CTRAY (Padgett et al. 1984 ). The intron size ranges
from 47 to 67 bp, similarly to most of the fungal introns
(Gurr et al. 1987 ).
pox4  mature transcripts were isolated in the presence of
both copper sulphate and ferulic acid. The 1,599-bp-long315

LE /handv TYPESET /handv CP /handok DISK /handokcDNA encompasses an opening reading frame coding for a
protein of 509 aa. The pox4  coding sequence is interrupted
by 19 introns, with all splicing junctions adhering to the
GT-AG rule.
No RNA species coding for pox5  could be detected in
the tested conditions. Moreover, identi Wcation of the splic-
ing junctions, based both on the GT-AG rule and on homol-
ogy with the other known laccase sequences, was uncertain
in the 3 /H11032 region of the gene.
A comparison of P. ostreatus  laccase gene structures is
shown in Fig. 1. The coding regions for the L1 and L2 sig-
nature sequences, containing copper-binding regions I and
II (Kumar et al. 2003 ), were located in analogous positions
in poxc , pox1  and pox4 , whilst the same region is organized
in a diVerent way in poxa1b  and poxa3 . In the pox3  gene
only one intron instead of three (found in poxc , pox1  and
pox4 ) and two (found in poxa1b  and poxa3 ) is included
between the L1 and L2 signature sequences. The structure
of the 3 /H11032 region is well conserved between pox1 , poxc , pox4
and poxa1b  genes, that have the L3 and L4 signature cod-
ing sequences equally organized, whereas the 3 /H11032 regions of
poxa3  and pox3  genes are more divergent.
Both POX3 and POX4 predicted protein sequences con-
tain N-terminal secretion signals (20 and 22 amino acids,
respectively), conform to the typical sequences of eukary-
otic proteins (Nielsen et al. 1997 ), the conserved ten histi-
dine and one cysteine residues of the copper-binding
centers of laccases, the fungal laccase signature sequences
L1-L4, as deWned by Kumar et al. ( 2003 ), and the substrate
binding loops (Fig. 2). Compared to the de Wned signature
sequences, POX3 only showed a tyrosine to phenylalanine
change in L1 and an alanine to  serine change in L2 (Fig. 2).
As in other laccases (Larrondo et al. 2003a ), sequences ofthe substrate binding loops (loops I–IV in Fig. 2)—
described from 3D structure analysis of crystallized lac-
cases (Bertrand et al. 2002 ; Hakulinen et al. 2002 ; Larr-
ondo et al. 2003a )—are relatively little conserved between
the P. ostreatus  proteins (Fig. 2).
Four potential N-glycosylation sites were identi Wed in
POX3 (Asn-212, Asn-297, Asn-436 and Asn-495) and two
in POX4 (Asn-4214 and Asn-441).
Identity percentages shared among protein sequences of
all the members of the P. ostreatus  laccase family are
reported in Table 2. Alignment of the deduced POX3 and
POX4 amino acid sequences with other known fungal lac-
cases shows for POX3 the highest overall identity (61%)
with laccase 1 from Pleurotus  eryngii  (UniProt accession
number Q308C0 ), whereas POX4 exhibits the maximum
identity (88%) with laccase LCC2 from Pleurotus sajor-
caju (UniProt accession number Q7Z8S5 ).
Heterologous expression of rPOX3 and rPOX4 
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  and in Kluyveromyces lactis
The heterologous expression of rPOX3 (rPOX3/Ala) and
rPOX4 was evaluated in the yeasts S. cerevisiae  and K. lac-
tis, by using heterologous expression systems previously
developed for the P. ostreatus  laccases POXC, POXA1b
and POXA3 (Piscitelli et al. 2005 ; Faraco et al. 2008a ).
Laccase native signal peptides were used.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae  and K. lactis  pox4  transfor-
mants did not produce any activity neither toward ABTS
nor toward DMP both in solid and in liquid cultures. The
expression of rPOX4 was ascertained by Western Blotting
with Anti-POXC antibodies, taking advantage of the high
degree of identity shared by the two proteins (78%).

LE /handv TYPESET /handv CP /handok DISK /handokA major band was detected in  culture supernatants of S.
cerevisiae  transformants at about 70 KDa, whereas the pre-
dicted molecular mass of POX4 is about 60 KDa (data not
shown). Two very faint signals were revealed by Western
Blotting on culture supernatants of K. lactis  transformants,
one at a molecular mass lower than that expected (40 KDa),
possibly indicating proteolytic degradation of the mature
protein, the other one showing a slightly higher apparent
molecular mass (about 65 KDa) (data not shown).pox3  transformants were found positive by plate activity
assay with DMP for both yeasts, producing a colored halo
in the presence of the chrom ogenic substrate. The enzyme
production was further investigated in liquid cultures, by
using ABTS as substrate. Time-course analysis of rPOX3
production was initially performed in the growth conditions
previously optimized for rPOXA1b and rPOXC (Piscitelli
et al. 2005 ). Maximum laccase activity production was
reached in the early growth ph ase for both yeasts, with a
higher level of production in S. cerevisiae  (around
30 mU ml¡1 at the second day) than in K. lactis  (around
12 mU ml¡1 at the third day). Because of the low level of
rPOX3 activity production in K. lactis , further experiments
were performed only in S. cerevisiae .
Unlike rPOXA1b production showing a continuous
increase during the yeast growth at least until the seventh
day, rPOX3 production exhibited a drop of activity on the
third day. In order to improve laccase production, the e Vect
of growth temperature and of induction conditions was
evaluated. Decreasing the growth temperature to 20°C didFig. 2 a  Comparison of the laccase signature sequences from the

LE /handv TYPESET /handv CP /handok DISK /handoknot signiWcantly aVect laccase activity maximum. Higher
laccase activity production was obtained by adding the
expression inducer (0.6 mM copper sulphate) later, 22 or
46 h after the inoculum time. In the latter condition a higher
eVect was observed with a laccase activity peak of
75 mU ml¡1 on the second day (data not shown).
Stability and kinetic parameters of rPOX3
Further experiments were carried out in order to verify if
the observed decrease of laccase activity in culture broth of
S. cerevisiae  transformed with pox3  was due to enzyme
instability. Supernatants of 42-h copper-induced cultures
lost 60% of their laccase activity after only 1 h of incuba-
tion at room temperature, whilst culture supernatants of
S. cerevisiae  transformed with poxa1b  retained 80% of
their laccase activity even after 12 h, thus con Wrming the
hypothesis of an unusual instability of rPOX3.
The addition of 20% glycerol to culture supernatants led
to a total retention of rPOX3 laccase activity, after 2 h.
Moreover, an even more relevant e Vect was observed by
adding copper sulphate to the enzyme sample (Fig. 3).
After 1 h incubation in the presence of the added copper,
the enzyme did not lose its activity and showed a further
increase, up to sevenfold the time zero value. This e Vect
proved to be copper concentration dependent. However,
loss of enzyme activity was observed at long times. When
the same experiments were performed on culture superna-
tants of S. cerevisiae  transformed with poxa1b , no eVect on
enzyme activity was observed after copper addition.
KM values of partially puri Wed rPOX3 were determined
toward the non-phenolic substrate ABTS and the phenolic
substrate DMP and compared with those of rPOXA1b pro-
duced in the same host. rPOX3 showed a remarkable lower
aYnity toward ABTS exhibiting a KM value fourfold higher(0.33 §0.02) than that of rPOXA1b (0.08 §0.01),
whereas the Michaelis cons tant toward DMP (0.83 §0.08)
is similar to that of rPOXA1b (0.57 §0.03).
Discussion
Three new members of the P. ostreatus  laccase gene fam-
ily, pox3 , pox4  and pox5 , have been isolated. Hence, the
panel of P. ostreatus  laccase genes has been enlarged up to
seven members, and their closely related spatial organiza-
tion on the fungus genome has been demonstrated. All the
P. ostreatus  laccase genes, pox1 , poxc , poxa1b , poxa3 ,
pox3 , pox4  and pox5  proved to be located within a 150-kb
genomic region, with pox3  and pox5  situated at a 800-bp
distance, pox1  localized in the same 8.5-kb fragment with
poxa3  and in the same 10-kb fragment with poxa1b ,
whereas the closeness of poxc  and pox1  genes had been
already previously demonstrated (Larraya et al. 2000 ).
The existence of such a gene clustering of laccase genes
had previously been observed in the other fungi P. chrysos-
porium  (Larrondo et al. 2004 ), Agaricus bisporus  (Smith
et al. 1998 ), Rhizoctonia solani  (Wahleithner et al. 1996 )
and Coprinopsis cinerea  (Kilaru et al. 2006 ), too. In many
other basidiomycetes, the presence of several di Verent lac-
case genes was reported (Yaver et al. 1996 ; Yaver and
Golightly 1996 ; Mansur et al. 1997 ; Soden and Dobson
2001 ; Hoshida et al. 2001 ; RodrÂguez et al. 2008 ), and in
this context the family of 17 laccase genes identi Wed by
Kilaru et al. ( 2006 ) in the released genome of C. cinerea  is
emblematic.
Comparison of P. ostreatus  laccase gene structures
revealed that pox4  shows exactly the same gene organiza-
tion of pox1  and poxc  genes. On the other hand, pox3  and,
even more, poxa3  exhibit a structure very di Verent fromFig.3Reconst itution of laccase

LE /handv TYPESET /handv CP /handok DISK /handokthat of the other members. pox3  is characterized by a
shorter length (2,120 bp), related to a reduced number of
introns. Only few intron positions are conserved in com-
parison to the other P. ostreatus  laccase genes, with most
of them common to the poxa1b  gene. The heterogeneity
of intron number between the L1 and L2 signature
sequences allows us to explain the di Verent lengths of
fragments obtained in PCR experiments with degenerate
primers and the absence of any ampli Wed product for
pox3 . A similar variability in introns numbers and posi-
tions between the copper-binding regions I and II was
found in Morchellaceae  species (Kellner et al. 2007 ), in
lcc16  and lcc17  of the basidiomycetes C. cinerea  (Kilaru
et al. 2006 ) and in Piloderma byssinum  (Chen et al.
2003 ).
The high sequence similarity and the identical intron–
exon structure shared by poxc , pox1  and pox4  genes along
with the high degree of identity among the corresponding
protein sequences indicate a close relationship between
these genes and suggest the existence of a “laccase subfam-
ily” consisting of these members. On the other hand, the
high structural divergence of poxa3  gene is in agreement
with the evolutionary distance among POXA3 and all the
other laccase family members. As a matter of fact, phyloge-
netic analysis of protein sequences of the P. ostreatus  lac-
case family revealed that all the members, except for
POXA3, fall in clades as close as similar intron–exon struc-
ture is shared by the corresponding genes (Hoegger et al.
2006 ). On the contrary, the atypical heterodimeric laccase
POXA3 (Giardina et al. 2007 ) falls in the cluster with
Agaricus bisporus  Lac2, a protein found associated to
smaller polypeptides (Perry et al. 1993 ; Wood 1980 ).
The nucleotide sequences extending 500-bp upstream of
the start codons in pox3  and pox4  genes were analyzed and
compared to those of poxc , pox1 , poxa3  and poxa1b
(Faraco et al. 2003 ) (Fig. 4). This analysis allowed individ-
uation of several putative response elements, di Verentially
distributed among the promoter sequences. Two potential
ARE motifs, involved in phenol antioxidant response in
mammalian cells, and previously detected in P. sajor-caju
lac4 promoter (Soden and Dobson 2003 ), were found in
pox3  and one in pox4 . Five putative Metal Responsive Ele-
ments (MRE), were identi Wed in pox3 , two of them match-
ing the consensus sequence TGCRCNC, the others di Vering
from the consensus for only one base pair, as already
reported for the other P. ostreatus  laccase promoters
(Faraco et al. 2003 ). Only one MRE could be predicted in
the pox4  promoter region. A more complex pattern of puta-
tive response elements characterizes poxc , pox1 , poxa3  and
poxa1b  promoters, including several di Verent putative reg-
ulative elements (Fig. 4), and among these all the putative
MREs in the 400-bp extended poxc  and poxa1b  promoter
regions are recognized by fungal proteins, except for thepoxc  MRE located downstream of the transcription-initia-
tion site (Faraco et al. 2003 ).
The pairwise alignment of the promoters of the P. ostre-
atus laccase gene family reveals that they are very little
conserved. The only exceptio n comes from the comparison
of poxc  and pox1  promoters, showing 81% identity, in
agreement with their grouping in the same “laccase sub-
family”. No signi Wcant similarities were found, instead,
between both pox1  and poxc  promoters when compared to
pox4 , despite the close relationship of these genes and of
their corresponding proteins.
Interestingly, pox1 , poxc  and pox4  promoters exhibit a
very high degree of identity (95–97%) with the upstream
regions of the laccase genes from P. sajor-caju  lac1, lac4
and lac2 (Soden and Dobson 2003 ), respectively. Such
relation among these genes is also con Wrmed by the high
degree of similarity shared by  their corresponding proteins:
POX1 has a 99.5% identity with Psc Lac1, POXC shares a
99.1% identity with Psc L ac4, and POX4 shows a 91%
identity with Psc Lac2. Transcripts levels of P. sajor -caju
laccase isozyme genes have been shown to be di Verentially
regulated in response to copper, manganese, nutrient nitro-
gen and several aromatic compound (Soden and Dobson
2001 ), suggesting that a similar mechanism could also
occur for P. ostreatus  laccases.Fig. 4 Distribution of putative cis-acting elements in the promoter re-

LE /handv TYPESET /handv CP /handok DISK /handokPOX3 and POX4 production by P. ostreatus  has not
been detected so far. It could be due to the di Verent condi-
tions required to produce active forms of these isoenzymes
that have not been explored yet. Therefore, to analyze prop-
erties of POX3 and POX4 is oenzymes their recombinant
expression was needed. Previous attempts to obtain homol-
ogous expression of POXC isoenzyme had been unsuccess-
ful because of the very low e Yciency of fungal
transformation (unpublished data). On the other hand, het-
erologous recombinant expression of POXA1b, POXC and
POXA3 had been successfully performed in the yeasts
S. cerevisiae  and in K. lactis  (Piscitelli et al. 2005 ; Faraco
et al. 2008a ). Therefore, recombinant heterologous expres-
sion of POX3 and POX4 was performed in these hosts,
using the expression systems previously developed for the
other P. ostreatus  laccases. rPOX4 proved to be expressed
at very low level both in S. cerevisiae  and in K. lactis .
Taken together, the results of  laccase activity assays and
Western blotting analyses on pox4  transformants indicate
either the expression of a no t active form of the recombi-
nant enzyme or expression of an active form at not detect-
able levels. Even when di Verent culture conditions were
explored or experiments of copper additi on to culture
supernatants of pox4  transformants were performed no
improvement of laccase activity was observed. A not cor-
rect folding and di Verences with codon usage of the hosts
could explain the low pox4  expression levels. On the otherhand, an active rPOX3 was obtained in both hosts, even if
at lower levels than those of the other P. ostreatus  laccases
(Piscitelli et al. 2005 ). The quick drop of rPOX3 activity
production in S. cerevisiae  culture broth was related to loss
of copper and formation of an apo-laccase, that could be
reconverted in holo-enzyme by copper addition to cell-free
Wltrates, thus demonstrating that metal depletion is revers-
ible (Koroleva et al. 2001 ), and suggesting that the apo-
enzyme retains at least a partially folded state (Wilson et al.
2004 ). Our results are in agreement with those of Larrondo
et al. ( 2003b ), showing that Aspergillus nidulans  trans-
formed with a laccase cDNA from Ceriporiopsis subver-
mispora  secreted an apo-laccase that could be reconstituted
by copper.
Analyzing the POX3 sequence, the only di Verence in the
region surrounding the type II copper-binding site is a tyro-
sine residue at the position 69, unusual in basidiomycete
laccases which have a conserved phenylalanine in the same
position (Fig. 2). The corresponding position is occupied by
a glutamic acid (Glu106) in CueO, and by an histidine in
Melanocarpus albomyces  laccase (His98), in which this
residue was found as an oxidized form (2-oxohistidine)
(Hakulinen et al. 2008 ). The polarity of this residue was
found to inXuence solvent interaction and lability of the
type II copper in CueO bacterial laccase (Li et al. 2007 ).
A more hydrophobic residue would gate the tunnel con-
necting type II copper to the protein surface preventing itsFig.5Compar ison between

LE /handv TYPESET /handv CP /handok DISK /handokexchange with solvent. As a fact, mutation of this Glu to a
Phe enhanced CueO oxidation activity lowering T2 copper
deWciency (Li et al. 2007 ). In rPOX3, the addition of exog-
enous copper could counterbalance type II copper lability
caused by the presence of a more hydrophilic residue
(Y69), providing an overall enzyme stabilization.
The higher KM measured for rPOX3 toward the bulkier
substrate ABTS compared with rPOXA1b, could be
explained by analysis of the POX3 3D model, that revealed
a more buried substrate interacting pocket with respect to
POXA1b, due to an elongated loop B1-B2 (Fig. 2) pro-
duced by the insertion (R162-G164), that would hinder the
access of the substrate (Fig. 5).
Although POX3 shares the highest closeness with
POXA1b within the P. ostreatus  laccase family in terms of
both protein sequence similar ity and conservation of some
intron positions, the corresponding recombinant protein is
revealed much less stable.

                                         84Development of molecular tools to impr ove laccase heterologous expression in 
yeasts 
Laccases have attracted a lot of research interest in the last decades. As a 
widespread and heterogeneo us class of oxidative enzyme s, laccases have been the 
object of deep biochemical investigations. At the same time, interest in laccases is 
ever increasing due to their potential use in several biotechnological and 
environmental applications. Large amounts of laccase are required for fu ndamental studies on laccase properties 
and, especially, for their practical use. Nevertheless, laccases secreted from wild-
type plant or fungal organisms may not be su itable for commercial purposes mainly 
because of low yields or high cost of  preparation procedures. Heterologous 
expression should be better suited for large-scale production, because of the 
potential of expressing different laccases in one selected optimised host. At least 29 
fungal laccase genes, including five from Trametes villosa  and Trametes sanguinea , 
four form Rhizoctonia solani , three from Badiomycetes I-62 (CECT 20917) and 
Pleurotus ostreatus , two from Agaricus bisporus , Pycnoporus cinnabarinus , and one 
each from Neurospora crassa , Coriolus hirsutus , Phlebia radiata , Coprinus 
congragatus , Mauginiella  sp. and Volvariella volvacea , have been cloned and 
expressed in heterolo gous hosts [1]. Eukaryotic hosts such as Aspergillus  oryzae , 
Pichia  pastoris , Saccharomyces  cerevisiae  and Trichoderma  reesei  proved to be the 
most suitable microorganisms for laccase expr ession since they can provide efficient 
post-translational modifications required by  laccases, such as glycosylation and 
disulphide bond formation. Filamentous fungi are, at least so far, the best producers of recombinant laccases, 
with protein yields from 70 mg l
-1 [2] to 230 mg l-1 [3]. However, they are more time 
consuming to work in comparison with y easts. Besides possessing characteristics 
favourable for fermentation pr ocess, the yeasts can grow to high cell densities and 
secrete heterologous proteins e fficiently, and also provide efficient post-translational 
modifications such as glycosylation. In addi tion, the genetic mani pulations of yeasts 
are easy and well developed. Regarding laccase production in yeasts, a considerable variability of production 
yields with respect both to cDNAs expre ssed (originating from the same organism) 
and to the host used, has been reported [4,5,6]. Such “selectivity” in expression may reflect the inability of yeast to process di fferent laccases post-translationally with the 
same efficiency. Furthermore , these variable yields hi nder forecast of the most 
suitable host, or of the most pr omising laccase to be expressed. 
 This appendix deals with the experimental work carried out in the Laboratory of 
BiosCiences at Paul Cezanne University in Marseille during my three months of 
foreign experience. The challenge was to de sign strategies to maximize the yield of 
recombinant laccases, in the attempts to ra ise production levels sufficient to enable 
deeper understanding of the structure/function relati onships and, consequently, 
industrial applications of P. ostreatus  laccases.  
Two important criteria to be met in order to make recombinant protein production 
economically and industrially feasible ar e: 1) a high copy number of the gene 
introduced into the host organism in order to  obtain a high-level expression and 2) a 
high mitotic stability of that gene, since t he large-scale production of proteins often 
requires long-term culturing of the reco mbinant host in non-selective media.  
These topics have been addressed by designing  two suitable molecular strategies: 1) 
the development of autosel ection system and 2) the c onstruction of high-copy  85number integrative vectors. Bo th approaches have been applied to S. cerevisiae  
expression system in attempt to optimize P. ostreatus  laccase yields of production 
obtained in earlier experimental work [7]. Moreover, since the production of  a functional protein can be intimately related to the 
cellular machinery of the host organisms, la ccase expression was also investigated 
in an alternative host: Pichia pastoris.  
 
1. Development of a S. cerevisiae  autoselection system 
The first key factor required for successf ul production of a gene product expressed 
from an episomal plasmid, is the stability of  the vector. However,  as the requirement 
for defined minimal medium for plasmid selection imposes s ub-optimal growth 
conditions and reduces yields of protein pr oduction, so the use of selective drugs 
may be undesirable or expensive. One strategy to avoid the limitations of selective medium is to use autoselection. 
Autoselection relies on the pr esence of a plasmid to provi de an essential activity for 
an otherwise unviable host, without employing any external nutrient or antibiotic 
selection. In such systems, selecti on of the transformed population occurs 
independently of the growth medium composition, allowi ng the use of relatively 
inexpensive complex media, which are pr eferred in industry for commercial-scale 
fermentations. Different autoselecti on systems have been developed for S. 
cerevisiae  host cells [8, 9, 10, 11]. Host cells  may be unviable because they lack an 
essential gene, or becaus e of a mutant gene which under  certain conditions is 
essential, or because of additional lethal elements wh ich are counteracted by a 
plasmid product.  Autoselection systems relying on  the rescue of lethality of fur1 ura3 mutants by 
URA3  plasmids have been reported in S. cerevisiae  and Kluyveromyces lactis . The 
FUR1  gene of S. cerevisiae  encodes uracil phosporibosyl-transferase, which 
catalyzes the conversion of uracil into urid ine 5’-phosphate in t he pyrimidine salvage 
pathway. If this gene were disrupted, S. cerevisiae  ura3
 strains would therefore not 
be viable, unless it possessed a complementing functional URA3 gene to synthesize 
uridine 5’-phosphate de novo . This autoselection system has found several 
applications in both host strains. Several works reported on an improved production 
of different expressed proteins by usin g autoselective strains grown in complex 
media as compared to minimal media. [12, 13]. β-xilanase activity, for example, 
increased up to 24 fo ld in autoselective S. cerevisiae  strain when the cells were 
cultures in YPD medium instead of selective SC medium [13]. 
 
Material and methods 
Construction of the disruptive plasmid  
Standard protocols were followed for DNA mani pulation, accordingly to matherial and 
methods section of chapter 4. The FUR1  gene sequence was recovered from S. cerevisiae  genome database 
(http://www.yeastgenome.org/) and the fo llowing oligonucleotide couple was 
designed for its amplification from genomic DNA: Fur1fw 5’-GCAGGTCATTGCAATAACAGAAAGGC-3’ and Fur1rev 5’-GGTTCTATT 
TTAACGGGGTTATCTACC-3’. The resulting 1305bp fragment was cloned into 
pGEMT-Easy vector. A 250bp dele tion was generated within the FUR1  open reading 
frame by inverse PC R on the pGEMT-easy- FUR1  vector: the reverse (Fur1int/rev 
CTGTTGCACAGGTAGATGG), and the forward primers (Fur1int/fw 
CTTCCTATTAGACCCAATGC) provide,  respectively, a cleaved PvuII  end and the  86insertion of an AgeI restriction site on the amplified vector. LEU2 gene was amplified 
using the LEU2 -plasmid pYEP351 as template, wit h the following oligonucleotides: 
NarILeu2fw 5’-TTTGGCGCCGGTAAAATAGCG CTC TCG-3’; XmaILeu2rev 5’-
AAACCCGGGTGCGGTATTTCACACCGC-3’. The am plified fragment was cloned 
into SmaI digested pUC19 and che cked by sequencing. The LEU2  gene was then 
isolated as a 2243bp PvuII -XmaI  fragment and ligated to pGEMT-easy- ∆fur1 vector 
produced by inverse PCR and digested with AgeI. The resulting disruptive allele 
fur1::LEU2 can be recovered from the recombinant vector by BstZI  digestion and 
used to promote gene replacem ent with the chromosomal FUR1  gene. 
  
Results  
The aim of this study was to apply the fur1/URA3  based autoselection system to 
laccase production by S. cerevisiae . As described in chapter 4, laccase heterologous 
expression in W303-1A S. cerevisiae  strain ( MATade2-1, his3-11, 15, leu2-3, 112, 
trp1-1, ura3-1, can1-100)  is linked to pSAL4 episomal vector (based on URA3  as 
selection marker) and is carried out in a selective medium. T he development of a 
reliable system which can provide FUR1  deletion in the gen omic background of 
whatever recombinant strain carrying an URA3  
based vector, would represent a valid tool to improve product yields by testing laccase production in rich media. In order to cause a genomic deletion in 
FUR1  
gene, a plasmid carrying a 
fur1::LEU2  cassette was 
designed (Fig.1). The deletion cassette can be 
excised as a 3.3kb linear BstZI  fragment and subsequent ly transformed into S. 
cerevisiae  strains, to produce the mutated fur1 phenotype by gene replacement with 
the chromosomal FUR1  gene. 
The results obtained so far, deals with the design and c onstruction of the deleting 
plasmid, whilst further work will be address ed to achieve the deleted mutant and to 
analyze laccase production in the autoselective strains. 
 
2. Designing of expression vectors for hi gh-copy number integration into the 
ribosomal DNA of S. cerevisiae  
The potential instability of episomal vect ors can pose problems for expression of 
some heterologous proteins, especially in la rge industrial applications where cells are 
often subjected to prolonged growth in the absence of  selection. The use of 
integrative expression  vectors would represent a valid alternative to overcome this 
limitation. Owing to  their integration into t he host genome by homologous 
recombination, this kind of expression vect or assures an increased genetic stability of 
the transformed strain com pared with episomal systems. 
A number of integrative ve ctors have been developed for t he yeasts most commonly 
applied in industrial processes such as K. lactis  and S. cerevisiae . A widespread 
used integrative vector for K. lactis , utilizes the LAC4 strong promoter to both drive 
gene expression and to direct plasmid insert ion into the homologous genomic locus. pGEMT-easy pGEMT-eas y

by directing the recombination at ura3 locus [15]. The main drawback of this kind of 
integrative vector is the reduction in vector copy number and, consequently, in 
expression levels compared to episomal vectors. As a fact, the majority of 
transformants deriving form plasmid insertion at a specific genomic locus, contain a 
single copy of the integrat ed vector. Transformants containing several copies (2-10) 
of tandemly integrated vect ors are generally obtained at very low frequencies (2-5% 
of the transformed population) [16]. One method devised to increase the copy num ber of integrative vectors, involves 
integration into the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus, a region of tandemly repeating DNA 
in the host chromosome, which frequently  leads to multicopy integration. 
The number and the length of these rDNA repeats can vary cons iderably between 
different species. In S. cerevisiae , about 150 copies of a 9-kb unit are localized at a 
single locus on chromosome XII. Each unit harbours the coding sequences for 25S, 
18S, and 5.8S rRNA, which are processed from a 35S precursor transcript. The 
coding sequence for the 5S species is located between two precursor units and 
separated from them by non-transcribed spac ers (NTS1 and 2) (Fig.2). The promoter 
elements are located in the NTS regions, whilst the functions of some other 
regulatory elements in the NTS or the ITS (intergeni c spacer) have also been 
described [17].  
 
Integrative systems based on rDNA-targeting elements have been successfully 
applied in several yeasts, such as Hansenula polymorpha  [18], Arxula adeninivorans  
[19], K. lactis  [20], S. cerevisiae  [21], Yarrowia lipolytica [22]. Besides being 
organized in repeated units, rDNA clusters contain highly conserved regions which 
can be exploited to direct plasmid int egration into a broad range of heterologous 
hosts. Particular conserved rDNA sequences  (generally derived from the portion 
ETS-18S-5.8S or covering the 25S rDNA regi on) have shown to be suitable for this 
purpose. Several “universal” vector bas ed on rDNA targeting have been designed 
and applied for protein expressi on in different yeasts, provid ing a useful tool for the 
comparative assessment of several selected organisms for criteria  like appropriate 
protein processing, modification or secret ion [23]. rDNA integration approach also 
represents and interesting tool for the co -expression of more than one recombinant 
protein in the same host. Stable co-integrat ion of up to three different expression 
plasmids by a single transformation step, fo llowed by the efficient co-expression of 
the integrated genes, has  been demonstrated in Hansenula  polymorpha  and Arxula  
adeninivorans  [23, 24].

Construction of the integrative vector  
Standard protocols were followed for DNA mani pulation, accordingly to matherial and 
methods section of chapter 4. The 1.1kb rDNA region was amplified from S. cerevisiae  genomic DNA, by means of 
Taq polymerase (Promega) with the followi ng couple of oligonucletides: rDNAPvuIIfw 
GACTAGGCAGCTGTGACGATCACC and r DNAPvuIIrev AAAGTTGGTCGGCAGCT 
GGCATGC. Both primers included an added PvuII  site at their 5’-ends. The amplified 
fragment was cloned into pGEMT-easy vect or and its sequence was checked. The 
rDNA containing fragment was then excised by NotI digestion and cloned into the 
pPICZαA (Invitrogen) vector, resulting in plasmid pPICrDNA. The DNA region 
including the elements required for propagation and selection of the integrative vector 
in E. coli , Ori and bla gene  (conferring Ampicillin resistanc e, Ap), was amplified from 
pUC18 cloning vector using the follo wing oligonucleotides: OriAmpSnaBIfw 
GGCGGTAATACGTATATCCACAG and OriA mpSnaBIrev TGGTTTCTTATACGTAA 
GGTGGC. This reaction allo ws the insertion of a SnaBI  restriction site upstream and 
downstream the 1.8kb amplif ied fragment.  Thus, the SnaBI  digested Ori-Ap region 
was cloned into pPICrDNA, in the unique SnaBI  contained in the rDNA cloned region, 
to obtain pPICrDNA-OriAp plasmid. The se lection of recombinan t clones was carried 
out in Zeocin containing LB medium , taking advantage of the presence of a ble gene 
(conferring Zeocin resistance) in pPIC rDNA backbone. The same recombinant 
clones were also tested for their Ampicillin resistance in order to verify the correct 
amplification of bla gene.  
The following couple of primers p SAL4PvuIIfw AAATTGCCCAGCTGTCTTAACC  
and pSAL4PvuIIrev CCTTTGAGTCAGCTGATACC GC, was used to amplify a 3.4kb 
fragment from B-pSAL4 expression vector (pSAL4 vector containing poxa1b  cDNA 
described in Piscitelli et. al [7]) by the means of Takara polymerase (Lonza). The 
amplified fragment contains the CUP1- poxa1b -CYCterm expression cassette and the 
URA3  selection marker. The latter has been am plified as an expression-deficient 
allele ( URA3d ), by providing a deletio n of its promoter region: only 46 nucleotides 
upstream of its starting codon  have been amplified, as pr eviously reported in [25]. 
Both primers introduce a PvuII  restriction site at bot h fragment ends. The 2.9kb 
cassette containing the Ori-Ap region flanked by the 250bp and 872bp rDNA 
fragments at 5’ and 3’ res pectively, was excised by PvuII  digestion from pPICrDNA-
OriAp plasmid and ligated to the PvuII

Results 
The aim of this study was to design a rDNA -targeting integrative vector for laccase 
expression in S. cerevisiae . Several elements have been considered to design such 
an integrative vector: - The first step was the choice of a suit able rDNA region for genome targeting.  
Different rDNA portions have been used to dire ct vector integrati on in the rDNA locus 
of several yeast species. In all the repor ted examples, the number of plasmid copy 
integrations and its stability after long  periods of growth under non selective 
conditions, turned out to be affected by  the nature of t he rDNA region.  
The vector designed in this study is based on S. cerevisiae  pMIRY2D (Multiple 
integration into ribosomal DNA in yeast) plasmid previously described by Lopes and 
co-workers [26]. This plasmid contains a 1.1kb BglII-SphI fragment of the rDNA unit 
(Fig.2). It was found to int egrate into rDNA locus of S. cerevisiae  with a high copy  89number (100-200 copies per cell) and to be stably kept on yeast chromosome (80-
100% of the plasmid copies retained ov er 70 generations of  growth under non-
selective conditions). This high mitotic stab ility has been ascribed to the nature of the 
rDNA elements contained in th is region, being depe ndent on the presen ce of specific 
rDNA regulatory elements such  as those contained in the ITS, HOT1 elements (Hot-
spot for recombination) and the PolI tran scription enhancer. Moreover plasmid size 
was found to be an important, determinant of mitotic stability, being pMIRY-type 
vectors stably maintained in the rDNA cluster only if their size is sm aller than or at most 
equal to the size of the rDNA unit (9.1kb).  
- The construction of the integrative vector requires the presence of ori and AmpR  gene 
for propagation and selection in E. coli . 
However, it has been r eported previously that 
bacterial sequences are potentially toxic to other organisms and ther efore may decrease 
vector stability in yeast [27]. Besides, bacterial DNA is not acceptable in a so-called “food-grade-vector”, a status which is an advantage 
to gain clearance for use in the commercial biotechnological produc tion of proteins. For 
these reasons the Ori-Amp
R cassette was 
cloned inside the rDNA regions. In this way, by cutting the integrative vector with SnaBI  
enzyme, the bacterial sequences are re moved and the lin earized integrating 
fragment is produced as well. This strat egy has the additional advantage that the 
final dimension of the integrati ng plasmid are shortened to 4.6 kb. 
- High amplification of plasmid copy numbe rs can be obtained by  applying a strong 
pressure for the selection of transformed clones. This can be achieved by using a 
selective marker gene that is expressed from  a suboptimal promoter. To this aim, a 
promoter defective URA3 gene  was created by providing a small deletion in its 
promoter region [26]. The defective URA3 gene (URA3d) was thus chosen for further 
construction of the integrative vector. - The expression cassette of the in tegrative vector is derived from S. cerevisiae  
pSAL4 expression vector and consists of a CUP1 copper-inducible  promoter, and a 
CUP1 terminator separated by multiple cloni ng sites for the insertion of foreign gene 
to express. P. ostreatus  laccase POXA1b was chosen as reporter gene to validate 
the systems, since it has proved  to be efficiently produced in S. cerevisiae  when its 
expression was associated to t he episomal pSAL4 vector [7]. 
The integrative vector for lacca se heterologous expression in S. cereivisiae , named 
pYINA1b, was constructed following the abov e described criteria. Further work will be 
addressed to test the designed system for its copy number, mitotic stability and 
laccase production in S. cerevisiae .   
  
3. Heterologous expression of P. ostreatus laccases in Pichia pastoris 
Pichia pastoris  has gained widespread attention as  an expression syst em because of 
its ability to express high levels of heter ologous proteins for both basic laboratory 
research and industrial manufacture. This me thylotrophic yeast is particularly suited 
to foreign protein expression for a number  of reasons, including ease of genetic 
Fig.3 Integrative vector designed 
for laccase expression  90manipulation, high level of prot ein expression at the intra- or extracellular level, and 
the ability to perform higher eukaryotic protei n modification, such as glycosylation, 
disulphide bond formation and proteolytic proce ssing. Regarding its ability to perform 
post-translational modifications, the glycosy lated gene products gen erally have much 
shorter glycosyl chains than those expressed in S. cerevisiae , thus making P. 
pastoris  a much more attractive host [28]. Be cause of these characteristics, many 
proteins have been successfully produced in functionally active form in P. pastoris  
[29]. Several factors affecting t he level of protein expression in P. pastoris  have been 
investigated, ranging from molecular ones to those related to the production process. 
Being a methylotrophic yeast, P. pastoris  is able to utilize methanol as the sole 
carbon and energy source. A key enzyme for methanol metabolism is alcohol 
oxidase (AOX) whose expression is tightly regulated at transcrip tion level, being 
repressed by glucose and induced by meth anol to very high levels, typically ≥30% of 
the total soluble protein in cells grown with methanol. For this reason, the inducible 
AOX promoter has been the most widel y utilized to regulate the foreign gene 
expression. Other molecular factors su ch has the choice of proper genetic 
background of a Pichia  host strain, have been shown to influence the level of protein 
production. This is best illustrated by the us e of protease-deficient  strains to improve 
the quality and yields of va rious heterologous proteins . On the other hand, since P. 
pastoris  has no native plasmids, expression vectors designed for chromosomal 
integration have been devel oped, thus ensuring the genetic stability of the 
recombinant strains even in continuous and large scale fermentation processes [29]. 
In addition to efficient expressi on of intracellular products, P. pastoris is also capable 
of secreting high levels of foreign protei ns. This is particularly advantageous, since 
simple purification of secreted recombinant pr oteins is possible due to the relatively 
low levels of native extrace llular proteins [29]. Subtle  controlling of cultivation 
parameters has also shown to minimize prot eolyitic instability in the culture medium. 
Lowering the pH of the medium to more acid ic values results in  inactivating many 
neutral pH proteases without affecting the gr owth significantly; the addition of amino 
acid-rich supplements (e.g., peptone, ca samino acids) by possibly acting as 
alternative competing substrates for prot eases or repressing protease induction 
caused by nitrogen limitation, has also shown to enhance product stability. Further advantages of Pichia  system include the fast growth in inexpensive 
chemically defined m edia, together with the ease of hi gh-density growth and scale-up 
to higher volume fermentations. In this regard, shake-flasks c onditions are normally 
sub-optimal, due to limitations of volume, ox ygen transfer, substrate addition and an 
inability to monitor these factors efficient ly. Among the other fa ctors, monitoring 
methanol in Pichia  process is extremely important, since high levels of methanol 
(above 5g/l) can be toxic to the cells [30] and low levels of this carbon source may 
not be enough to initiate tran scription [31]. A large impr ovement in productivity is 
commonly achieved using bioreactors in wh ich all these process parameters can be 
monitored and controlled simultaneously allo wing more efficient production of the 
desired heterologous protein [29]  
Pichia proved to be a useful system for the production of laccases from various 
sources, including T. versicolor  [32], Trametes sanguinea  [33], P. cinnabarinus  [34], 
Pleurotus sajor-caju  [35] and Ganoderma  lucidum  [36]. Generally, best results were 
obtained when AOX1 prom oter was used, with levels of active protein concentrations 
ranging from 0.008 to 0.11g/ L; however laccase expression by glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) pr omoter system also tur ned out to be a potential 
option, achieving up to 0.1g/l of active protein production [ 37]. In most of the cases,  91the use of controlled conditions in bioreac tors instead of using shake-flasks produced 
higher laccase yields.  
Material and methods 
Construction of expression vector
 
Cloning and expression of P. ostreatus  laccase have been performed using the 
“Easy Select Pichia  Expression kit” (Invitrogen) follo wing manufacturer’s instructions.  
pPICZB was chosen as expression vector . Its expression cassette includes the 
AOX1 promoter that allo ws methanol-inducible high le vel expression and the AOX1 
transcriptional terminator. POX3 and POX4 cDNAs have been amplified by means of 
PrimeSTAR® HS DNA polymerase (Takara) wit h the following couple of 
oligonucleotides: pox3EcoRIfw TTGAAT T CATAATAATGATTGCGCCTGTAC and 
pox3XbaIPichREV AATCTAGATTAGGT CGAAGGGTGCGTG; pox4EcoRIfw TGAAT 
TCATAATAATGCGCACATTC TCCC;pox4XbaIPichR EVATCTAGACTAGGTTGGGA
GCAAACC respectively and using th e corresponding pSAL4-POX3 and pSAL4-
POX4 vectors (see chapter 4) as templates.  These amplifications  allow the insertion 
of EcoRI  and XbaI cloning sites upstream and downstr eam the cDNAs.  Moreover, 
the yeast consensus sequence AYAATA  (Y= T, C) has been added before the 
starting ATG in order to pr omote laccase translation in the yeast. No tag has been 
added at 3’ of each cDNA sequences, by preserving their native stop codons. The 
EcoRI /XbaI amplified laccase POX3 and POX4  sequences, including their native 
signal peptides, were cloned into pPICZB  giving pPB3 and pPB4 respectively. 
Laccase sequences of both recombinant cl ones were checked to rule out any 
amplification error. 
Expression of POX3 and POX4 laccases in P. pastoris  
P. pastoris  X-33 was transformed with pPB3 and pPB4 by electroporation. Both 
plasmids were digested with PmeI , whose cleavage site is located in the AOX1 
promoter, to efficiently target plasmid intergration to the AOX1 locus of yeast 
genome. Transformants were selected on YPDS (1%Yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% 
glucose with 1M sorbitol added) plates supplemented with 100 µg/ ml Zeocin. Mut 
(Methanol utilization) phenotype of  transformants was tested by replica plating on MD 
(minimal medium plus glucose) and MM (min imal media plus 0.5% methanol) media. 
The same clones were screened for lacc ase production on MM solid medium 
containing ABTS (0,5mM final  concentration) and CuSO 4 (0.6mM). Laccase-
producing transformants were identified by  the presence of a dark green colour 
around the clones. The best laccase producing transformants were inoculated into 5 
ml of buffered glycerol complex medium BM GY (10g/l yeast extract, 20g/l peptone, 
0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, YNB 13.4g/ l, biotin 400µg/l, 100 ml of 10% (v/v) 
glycerol) medium (Minimal glycerol medium  buffered at pH6) and  incubated at 28°C 
overnight in a shaking incubator (200r pm). Then the cells were harvested and 
resuspended into 25 ml of production medium (buffered minimal medium)BMMY 
(10g/l yeast extract, 20g/l peptone, 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, YNB 13.4g/l, 
biotin 400µg/l, 1.5% methanol, 0.6mM CuSO 4) in 250ml flasks, to an OD of ~1. 
Transformants were cultivated at 28°C or 20°C, shaking at 200 rpm and methanol 
was daily added to a concentration of 1.5% to  replace that consumed by the cells or 
lost by evaporation. Samples were analysed daily for laccase activity using ABTS assay and cell growth was also measured by taking OD
600 readings. 
    92Results  
Cloning and expression of POX3 and POX4 laccases   
The expression of P. ostreatus  POX3 and POX4 coding cDNAs was carried out in 
the heterologous host P. pastoris . To this aim, both sequences, were cloned in the 
pPICZB expression vector. Laccase secretion in the extracellular medium is driven 
by its native signal peptide and is regulated by AOX1 methanol inducible promoter. 
Both POX3 and POX4 expression vectors (pPB3 and pPB4) were successfully transformed into the yeast, and about 100 clones for each transformation were 
checked for their Mut phenotype by compar ing their growth ability on MD and MM 
media. This step is required in order to properly optimiz e the conditions for protein 
production, since both Mut
+ (fast growth on methanol as the only carbon source) and 
Muts (slow growth on methanol as the on ly carbon source) phenotypes can be 
produced by plasmid integratio n in AOX1 locus. As a fact, since the linearized 
plasmid is cut in the 5’AOX1 region, most of the transformants should be Mut+ as the 
insertion results in an intact copy of AO X1 gene. However, wit h the presence of the 
AOX1 sequences in the plasmid, there is a chance that recombination will occur in 
the 3’AOX1 region also, disrupting the wild-type AOX1 gen e and creating Muts 
transformants. The latter ones rely on AO X2 gene expression, which yields 10-20 
times less AOX activity than the AOX1 gene,  and consequently their growth ability on 
methanol is reduced. Currently, the ma jority of researchers use the Mut+ phenotype, 
although some reports have shown that low growth rate on methanol may be 
desirable for production of certain recombin ant products. By performing this analysis, 
Mut+ phenotype was confirmed for all the tested clones.  
The same clones were also checked for th eir laccase activity production on solid 
medium. POX3 transformants produced a wide and intense green halo around each 
streaked colony after one day of incubati on at 30°C. Otherwise,  POX4 transformants 
didn’t produce any activity after the same time  of incubation. A very faint activity halo 
around POX4 transformants appear ed only after prolonged incuba tion of the plates at 
4°C. In both cases, a notable heterogeneity of  laccase activity (evaluated by the size 
and intensity of the green halo produced) was not ed. This effect is ascribed to the 
variable number of vector integrations events occurring into the yeast genome. Thus, 
the expression level of several recombin ant clones was screened by plate assay in 
order to select the best producing ones. Three colonies were chosen for POX3 
transformants as well as for POX4 and they were further tested for laccase 
production in liquid culture. 
Analysis of laccase production in liquid culture   
Preliminary  results on laccase produc tion in liquid medium we re obtained performing 
P. pastoris  cultures in shake-flasks. Two ca rbon sources are required for laccase 
production: growth on glycerol containing  medium (BMGY) assures high-density 
growth, whilst the following switch to a methanol containing source (BMMY) is 
necessary to induce laccase expression.  A time-course analysis of rPOX3 and 
rPOX4 culture supernatants was initiall y performed on the recombinant clones 
selected by the first screeni ng on plate. A non-transformed Pichia  clone was also 
analysed as a control. In non-transformed yeast control, laccase activity assays measured by monitoring the ch ange in absorption at 420nm (to record the formation 
of a stable oxidized ABTS r adical product) showed a c onstant negative slope. The 
same effect was observed in rPOX4 cult ures until no activity was measured, 
indicating an interference in laccase assay when ABTS was used as substrate. After eight days of culture, up to 4U/ml la ccase levels were achieved for the best 
producing rPOX3 clone, whereas rPOX4 acti vity levels reached up to 0.015U/ml in  93the clone showing the highest laccase product ion. These results indicate a significant 
improvement of rPOX3 laccase producti on compared to the levels reached in S. 
cerevisiae  (around 0.03 U/ml at the 2nd day) and K. lactis  (around 0.012 mU/ml at the 
3rd day). Moreover, it is worth to note that rPOX4 laccase activity was not detected in 
neither of these two hosts, while it could be revealed, even if at low level, in P. 
pastoris .  
These preliminary results indicate that P. pastoris  could be a promising expression 
system for P. ostreatus  laccase if compared to S. cerevisiae  and K. lactis . However, 
the laccase production reported in these scouting experiments, could probably be 
enhanced by further optimization of medium and cultivation c onditions. In this regard, 
the use of bioreactor would be  preferable, since process parameters such as, oxygen 
transfer and methanol concentration would be more efficiently controlled than in 
shake-flask cultures, allowin g, among the other factors,  a better optimization of 
methanol-feeding strategies.

Abstract
The bleaching activity of the Pleurotus ostreatus POXC laccase isoenzyme has been tested against selected single textile acid
dyes (two anthraquinonic and two azo dyes), as well as towards a solution mimicking a real acid dye waste-water for wool.
The catalytic reaction of POXC has been investigated both in the presence and in the absence of the synthetic mediator
violuric acid (VIO) ( /C1NOH type of mediator). In all the cases tested, the presence of the mediator enhanced the reaction
rate and the percentage of decolorization, apart from one of the dyes (Acid Blue 62), which is itself a good substrate for thelaccase-catalyzed oxidation. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments, after the addition of an excess of VIO to
the solution of laccase, showed the presence of a strong and stable radical signal that was assigned to a neutral radical form
of VIO.
Keywords: POXC laccase, mediator, violuric acid, radical species, textile dyes
Introduction
White-rot fungi produce several extracellular en-
zymes that are able to degrade natural polymers,
such as lignin and cellulose, but can also degradedifferent synthetic chemicals which are usually
recalcitrant to biodegradation. Pleurotus ostreatus
produces laccases as major extracellular enzymes.Laccases (benzenediol: oxygen oxidoreductases;
EC1.10.3.2) belong to a group of polyphenol
oxidases containing copper atoms in the catalytic
centers, and usually called multicopper oxidases.
The active sites in these proteins include four Cuatoms that are classified into three types, according
to their spectroscopic properties: type 1 (T1) or blue
Cu, type 2 (T2), and type 3 (T3) or coupledbinuclear Cu sites. Functionally, all multi-copper
oxidases couple the four electron reduction of
dioxygen to water with the concomitant oxidationof a wide variety of substrates, such as polyphenols,
methoxy-substituted phenols, aromatic diamines,
and also synthetic dyes. The main functional roleof the T1 Cu site is to shuttle electrons from the
substrate to the trinuclear Cu cluster, which is the
site of oxygen reduction (Baldrian 2006). Several
characteristics of laccases (i.e. broad substrate spe-cificity and the use of molecular oxygen instead ofhydrogen peroxide that is used by peroxidases) makethis enzyme suitable to be investigated for industrialand environmental applications (Chivukula et al.
1995; Wong et al. 1999; Campos et al. 2001;
Martins et al. 2001; Novotny ´et al. 2001; Mayer
et al. 2002; Soares et al. 2002a,b; Martins et al.2003; Wesenberg et al. 2003; Zille et al. 2004;Bla´nquez et al. 2004; Levin et al. 2004).
With respect to other ligninolytic enzymes, such as
lignin peroxidase (LiP) and manganese peroxidase(MnP), which are more powerful oxidants (E 8is
slightlyB1 V), laccases have a lower redox potential
(E8from/C20.5 to/C20.8 V), allowing only the direct
oxidation of phenolic compounds.
However, the activity of laccase can be expanded
towards the oxidation of non-phenolic aromaticcompounds by the use of appropriate mediators

et al. 2005).
The role of mediators in laccase oxidation is
outlined in Scheme I.
Mediators are low molecular weight compounds
that are easily oxidized by laccases (at the T1 center)producing, in some cases, cation radicals whichdiffuse in solution and can oxidize more complexsubstrates, that, because of their size, cannot get intothe catalytic site. A large number of studies havebeen produced on the mechanism of oxidation ofnon-phenolic substrates by means of many media-tors (Camarero et al. 2005). In many cases, it has
been seen that the use of mediators during decolor-
ization of industrial textile dyes results in a fasterprocess, which often also produces more extensivedecolorization. Therefore, the action of the laccase-mediator system has been extensively studied inrecognition of its potential applications. An exampleof this is the laccase-mediator concept applied topulp bleaching, which represents an importantbiotechnological application of a process based ona single ligninolytic enzyme (Camarero et al. 2004).Likewise, a laccase/redox mediator formulation isused in the textile industry in the finishing processfor indigo-stained materials (Aly et al. 2004).
In this paper, the P . ostreatus POXC laccase
(Giardina et al. 1996) bleaching activity towardsselected textile acid dyes, two anthraquinonic andtwo azo dyes, in the presence and absence of violuricacid (VIO), a synthetic redox mediator of the /C1NOH
type, is reported, as well as the bleaching activitytowards a solution mimicking a real acid dye wastewater for wool. The presence of a strong radicalmediator has been detected by EPR.
Materials and methods
Organism, culture conditions and enzyme purification
White-rot fungus, P . ostreatus (Jacq.:Fr.) Kummer
(type: Florida) (ATCC No. MYA-2306) (PO 332SOPHIED register) was maintained through peri-odic transfer at 4 8C on potato dextrose agar plates
(Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) in the presence of0.5% yeast extract (Difco). Incubations were carriedout as previously described (Palmieri et al. 2005a).Secreted proteins were precipitated from the
filtered medium by addition of (NH
4)2SO4up to
80% saturation and, after extensive dialysis, loadedonto a DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow (PharmaciaBiotech Inc.) column, as previously described
(Palmieri et al .2005a). Fractions corresponding to
POXC were pooled, equilibrated in buffer 50 mMNa phosphate pH 7, 1 M (NH
4)2SO4(McIlvaine
buffer) and loaded on Phenyl Sepharose HighPerformance 35/100 (Amersham Bioscience).POXC was eluted with a linear gradient 1 00M
(NH
4)2SO4(500 mL).
The enzyme was assayed using ABTS as substrate,
as previously described (Palmieri et al .2005a).
Decolorization experiments
Four dyes were used: Acid Blue 62 (AB62), Acid
Red 266 (AR266), Acid Yellow 49 (AY49) from
Town End (Leeds, UK), and Reactive Blue 19
(RB19) from Sigma (St. Louis, USA). VIO wasfrom Aldrich.
Each dye (80 mM) was incubated with 1 U mL
/C281
(76 nM) of POXC in 0.1 M Na Citrate and 0.2 M
Na phosphate buffer at pH 4.5 at room temperature.Control samples without enzyme were run in parallelunder identical conditions. The effect of different
VIO concentrations (80, 160 and 800 mM) was
evaluated. The VIO stock solution (100 /C29) was
made in dimethylformamide (DMF), and the 1%DMF added to the reaction mixture had no effect onlaccase activity.
Experiments in the pH range 3 /C16 using McIlvaine
buffer, in the presence or absence of 160 mM VIO,
were performed. The percentage of decolorization
was determined monitoring the decrease in
the absorbance maxima characteristic of AB62(637 nm), AR266 (474 nm), AY49 (402 nm) andRB19 (592 nm).
A solution mimicking a real acid dye waste-water
for wool was prepared by mixing the acid dyes(80mM each) with 0.67 g L
/C281Na2SO4. The final
pH was adjusted to pH 5 by adding acetic acid.
Absorbance spectra were recorded in the range
280/C1800 nm after incubation with 1 U mL/C281of
POXC and 800 mM of VIO.
EPR experiments
CW X-band (9.4 GHz) EPR measurements were
carried out with a Bruker E500 Elexsys Series usingthe Bruker ER 4122 SHQE cavity and an Oxfordhelium continuous flow cryostat (ESR900). EPRsolutions were prepared with a final concentration of0.34 mM enzyme and 7 mM VIO (molar ratioenzyme/VIO 1:20) in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer,O2

Results and discussion
In this paper, three primary dyes from acid class
used for wool dyeing (AB62 anthraquinonic, AY49and AR266 azo dyes) (see Scheme II) were chosen
to study the ability of the laccase POXC from
P . ostreatus to decolorize textile dyestuffs, both
individually and in mixtures, either in the presence
or absence of the laccase mediator VIO. As the
capability of POXC to decolorize the anthraquinonic
dye RB19 (Scheme II) was already known (Palmieriet al.2005b), the effect of the mediator on this
reaction was tested to verify whether or not an
improvement of the decolorization process is ob-
tained. Synthetic dyes represent one of the major
sources of pollutants due to their extensive use inindustrial coloring, such as textile, paper, food and
pharmaceuticals. Inappropriate treatment of indus-
trial wastes has resulted in critical environmental
damage. Since some of the compounds contained in
these effluents are either toxic and mutagenic or may
be modified under anaerobic conditions to become
carcinogenic, there is great interest in the resolutionof the waste problem (Wong et al .1999). Azo and
anthraquinone groups are the major chromophores
present in commercial dyes and because of the large
chemical differences among the structures, there are
no general methods for detoxification of colored
wastes. Moreover, conventional methods are usually
limited by high costs and the production of second-ary toxic metabolites. Enzyme-based methods have a
minimal impact on ecosystems, so the new enzyme-
based methods can be employed in the degradation
of a wide range of chemically different compounds
(Forgacs et al .2004; Whiteley et al .2006).
In Figure 1, the residual color, measured at the
dye absorbance maxima, after 15 min incubation
with POXC, in the absence and in the presence of
different mediator concentrations are shown. It is
worth noting that AB62 is directly decolorized by
POXC, while only 29% decolorization at 800 mM
VIO was obtained for AY49, a highly recalcitrant
dye. In the latter case, apparent enzyme inhibition
can be observed at low VIO concentration and short
reaction times, while after 2 h incubation the per-
centage of AY49 decolorization increased propor-
tionally with the VIO concentration. In the case of
AR266 and RB19, the presence of the synthetic
mediator increased the reaction rate and a higher
VIO concentration led to a higher percentage ofdecolorization.
Analyses of the spectra recorded during incuba-
tion of AB62 and RB19 with POXC and medi-ator showed an early increase in the absorbance at
425 nm, followed by the decrease of this peak at
longer reaction times (data not shown). This phe-
nomenon is noticeable only in the presence of the
mediator, and is more marked at higher VIO
concentration. This event is probably related to the
formation of a transient species that decays withtime. The optimal pH of the VIO mediated decolor-
ization was in the range 4.5 /C15.0 for all the tested
dyes.
The ability of POXC to decolorize a dye mixture
mimicking a real acid dye waste-water for wool was
examined both in the presence and absence of VIO.
The optimal pH determined for the VIO-mediated
decolorization process corresponds to that of waste-
water arising from the wool dyeing process (pH 5.0).

VIO in the laccase reaction mixture led to asignificant absorbance reduction in the wavelength
range 400 /C1680 nm.
The catalytic mechanism of the POXC/VIO
system was investigated by EPR. In Figure 3(a) theEPR spectrum of P . ostreatus POXC laccase paired
with the simulation for the Cu T1 site is repor-
ted. Magnetic parameters for the T1 center are A

178+10/C284cm/C281and g ½½/C302.257. The values of
magnetic parameters for the T1 center are in
agreement with those reported in the literature forother laccases with a redox potential comparable
with that reported for this enzyme (Xu et al .1996).
The redox potential E 8for the P . ostreatus POXC
laccase was reported as 740 mV vs. NHE at pH /C30

EPR spectra of their T1 centers are very similar. In
the case of a lower value of E 8(/C2500 mV) the
A½½value of the T1 center can decrease to values
/C240+10/C284cm/C281with a g ½½value around 2.3
(Guckert et al .1995; Xu et al .1996).
After addition of an excess (1:20 enzyme:VIO
molar ratio) of VIO mediator, the appearance of a
strong and stable radical signal was evident. In
Figure 3(b), the EPR spectrum is compared withits simulation obtained using the following magnetic
parameters: g
iso/C302.0042, A N7/C3030.8 +10/C284cm/C281
and A N3/C302.5+10/C284cm/C281. The higher coupling
constant is primarily due to the nitrogen in position
7 and, to a lesser extent, to the nitrogen in position 3
(see Scheme II). From analysis of the isotropic
coupling constants it is not possible to define the
nature of the radical (cationic or neutral), but
preliminary DFT calculations have shown that the
VIO radical is in the neutral form (data not shown).
This confirms the suggested mechanism for thesynthetic /C1NOH mediators (Baiocco et al .2003)
which follow a radical hydrogen atom transfer route.
In this case, the laccase-catalyzed /C1NOH oxidation
proceeds through the reaction /C1NOH 0/C1N/C1O
+/C27
e/C28/C27H/C27as the rate limiting step, similar to the
reaction /C1COH0/C1C/C1O+/C27e/C28/C27H/C27which is in-
volved in laccase oxidation of phenolic compounds
(Xu 1996).Many factors contribute to the activity of laccase
for the oxidation of non-phenolic substrates; first is
the redox potential that is essentially determined by
the structure of the T1 site. It has been proposed
that, in blue copper proteins, the nature of the axial
ligand affects E 8; stronger axial ligands help in
stabilizing Cu(II), thereby lowering the E 8; weaker
axial ligands tend to destabilize Cu(II), thus raising
the E 8(Solomon et al .1996). In the case of
P . ostreatus POXC laccase, a Leu instead of a Met
is present as axial ligand giving E 8/C300.79 V at pH /C305
and 0.69 V at pH /C307vs.NHE (Garzillo et al .2001).
Other factors can contribute to E 8: the protein
environment can also affect E 8through H-bonding,
charged residues, etc. (Stephens et al .1996). How-
ever, laccase is able to oxidize substrate-mediators
with redox potential higher than that of the enzyme
itself, such as VIO (E 8/C300.90V vs.NHE at pH /C305)
(Xu et al. 2000). There is no direct correlation
between the redox potential of laccases and the
oxidation rate of specific substrates. Nevertheless,
the redox potential of laccase has to be high enough
to ensure the oxidation of a mediator with high redox
potential which will then be able, in turn, to oxidizehigh redox potential non-phenolic aromatic com-
pounds.
The pH value is also a key factor. Optimum pH
for the oxidation of acid dyes is around pH /C305 in the
presence of VIO, and lower (pH /C303) in the absence.O

In conclusion, a neutral radical species is formed
and detected during the reaction of P . ostreatus
POXC laccase in the presence of an excess of VIO.The bleaching activity towards single textile dyeswith different structure, as well as towards a modelwaste-water, is greatly enhanced by the presence ofthe mediator. In this context, the oxidized speciesof mediator has a dominant role in the oxidation ofnon-phenolic aromatic compounds. Understanding
the mechanism of electron and proton transfer and
insight on the interactions of laccases with mediatorscan be of great help in designing more active laccase-mediator systems for biotechnological applications.

Abstract
BACKGROUND: The ability of the fungi Pleurotus ostreatus and Phanerochaete chrysosporium to decolourize and detoxify 11
(mono-, dis-, poly- azo, and anthraquinonic type) dyes, wide ly used across the textile and leather industries, was tested.
RESULTS: Different substrate speciﬁcities were revealed between P. ostreatus and P. chrysosporium in decolourization
experiments. The latter fungus provided almost complete d ecolourization of the tested azo dyes up to 600 ppm and dis-
azo dyes up to 1000 ppm, and 80% decolourization of the tris-azo dye DBU1L38 at 1000 ppm, after 6 days. P. ostreatus provided
almost total decolourization of the anthraquinone type dye ABU62 (1000 ppm) after just 1 day. P. ostreatus also showed the
ability to decolourize the tested dis-azo and tris-azo dyes, givi ng the best performances against the dis-azo DBU1U1 (600 ppm)
dye, which was 100% decolourized after 6 days. Laccases proved to be the main enzymatic activities acting in P. ostreatus
decolourization.
CONCLUSION: The potential of the fungi P. ostreatus and P. chrysosporium as efﬁcient bio-systems for decolourization and
detoxiﬁcation of several toxic industrial dyes was demonstrat ed. The role of laccases in the decolourization of dis-azo dyes by
P. ostreatus was demonstrated for the ﬁrst time.

INTRODUCTION
Over 100,000 commercially available dyes exist and more than
7×105tonnes of dyestuff are produced annually and used
within the food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, textile and leatherindustries.
1,2
In order to meet the criteria necessary for industrial applications,
a huge variety of dyestuffs characterized by different colours,properties and molecular structures is produced. Existing dyes can
be classiﬁed either according to their origin, or according to their
chemical and/or physical properties and characteristics related tothe application process. The colouristic approach characterizes
dyes according to the dyeing method, and classiﬁes them as acid
or basic dyes, direct, reactive, azoic, mordant dyes, or vat dyes. Thechemical structure of the chromophoric group allows classiﬁcation
of synthetic dyes as azo dyes, anthraquinonic dyes, xanthene dyes,
triphenylmethane dyes, etc.
3Depending on their mode of binding
to the ﬁbre the release of dyes into the efﬂuent may vary greatly,
leading to a total annual discharge between 30,000 and 150,000
tons.4
In addition to their visual effect and their adverse impact in
terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen
demand (BOD), many synthetic dyes are also toxic.5–9
Moreover, the frequently high volumetric rate of industrial
coloured efﬂuent discharged, in combination with increasingly
stringent legislation, makes the search for appropriate treatmenttechnologies an important priority.10Unfortunately, all dyes used
in the textile industry are designed to resist fading upon exposureto sweat, light, water, many chemicals including oxidizing agents,and microbial attack. Chemical or physico-chemical methods forthe treatment of dye-containing wastewaters are generally costly,not very efﬁcient, of limited applicability, and produce wastes,
which are difﬁcult to dispose of.
Brightly coloured, water soluble reactive and acid dyes are
the most problematic, as they tend to remain unaffected byconventional treatment systems,
11and are also not removed by
municipal aerobic treatment systems.12Concern arises as many
dyes are made from known carcinogens such as benzidine andother aromatic compounds.

that azo- and nitro-compounds are reduced in sediments, resulting
in the formation of toxic amines. Anthroquinone-based dyes arevery resistant to degradation due to their fused aromatic ringstructure. The ability of some disperse dyes to bio-accumulate has
also been demonstrated.
13
As a viable alternative for remediation of textile industry
efﬂuents, biological processes have received increasing interestsince they can offer a low-cost and environmentally friendlysolution applying publicly acceptable treatment technology andproducing less sludge.
15
By far the most widely studied dye-decolourizing microorgan-
isms are the white-rot fungi (WRF). In addition to their natural
substrates, white-rot fungi have been found to be capable of
mineralizing a diverse range of persistent organic pollutants in-cluding synthetic dyes, unlike bio-degradative bacteria that tendto be rather substrate-speciﬁc.
16The ability of these fungi to
degrade such a range of organic compounds results from therelatively non-speciﬁc nature of their ligninolytic enzymes, suchas lignin peroxidase (LiP), manganese peroxidase (MnP), and lac-case. Certain WRF strongly decolourize particular dyes but notothers.
17,18
Small structural differences in dye mixtures can markedly affect
decolourization, and this may be due to electron distribution andcharge density, although steric factors may also contribute
19.
In this report the ability of the WRF Pleurotus ostreatus and
Phanerochaete chrysosporium to decolourize 11 dyes endowed
with different chemical structure (mono-, dis-, tris-azo andanthraquinone) and different colours and belonging to fourdifferent classes (reactive, disperse, direct and acid) has been
tested.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Microorganisms
Strains of the WRF, P. ostreatus (Jacq.:Fr.) Kummer (type: Florida)
(ATCC no. MYA-2306) and P. chrysosporium Burdsall M1 (DSM
13 583) were maintained through periodic transfer at 4◦Co na g a r
(1.5% w/v) plates containing undiluted and ten-fold diluted PDYmedium (24 g L
−1potato dextrose (Difco, Detroit, Michigan, USA)
and 5 g L−1yeast extract (Difco)), respectively.
Dyes
All the dyes used in this work (Table 1) were purchased from Sigma
(St Louis, USA), except for the acid dyes, which were supplied byYorkshire Europe. Before adding to each of the autoclaved growth
media, dyes were sterilized by tyndallization, consisting of three1 h cycles at 60
◦C with a 24 h interval between cycles.
Decolourization experiments
Decolourization of dyes in agar (1.5% w/v) plates was performed
using two different media: PDY medium, and 20 g L−1malt
extract medium (Difco). Solid cultures were supplemented withdye (Table 1) at a ﬁnal concentration of 30 ppm. Higher dyeconcentrations (150, 300, 600 and 1000 ppm) were added to solidmedia only when fungal strains proved to effectively decolourizeat the lower dye concentration. For these experiments, the fungusmycelium (a 5 mm diameter agar plug from the edge of a 7 dayold agar culture) was grown on agar plates (diameter 100 mm)containing the above described media supplemented with dye,and incubated in the dark at 28
◦C for 2 weeks. Controls consisting
of un-inoculated dye supplemented media were simultaneouslyincubated at 28
◦C.
Decolourization in liquid cultures was performed in micro-titre
plates with U bottom wells, using malt extract broth with differentdye concentrations chosen among 30, 150, 300, 600, 1000 ppm,on the basis of the ability of fungal strains to decolourize the dyes.In the experiments performed in micro-titre plates,
18the fungus
mycelium (a 3 mm diameter agar plug from the edge of a 7 dayold agar culture) was grown in four inside columns of eight-wellcolumns plates. Dyes were distributed in six-well columns, ﬁlledwith 200 µLo f2 0 g L
−1malt extract broth containing dye, the
two extreme columns remaining un-inoculated, representing thecontrol. External wells were ﬁlled with water to limit evaporation.Cultures were incubated in the dark at 28
◦C for 7 days on a rotary
shaker at 120 rpm.
Decolourization abilities by liquid cultures of fungi were also
investigated in 500 ml ﬂasks containing 250 ml of 20 g L−1malt
extract broth at dye concentrations that had been decolourized
with an efﬁciency of at least 50% of decolourization in micro-titreplates.
Liquid cultures in ﬂasks were prepared by pre-inoculating
300 mL of 20 g L
−1malt extract broth in 1 L shaken ﬂasks with
P. ostreatus mycelia (5 agar plugs of 12–15 mm diameter from the
edge of a 7 day agar culture) or P. chrysosporium mycelia (three
agar plugs of 12–15 mm diameter from the edge of a 7 day agarculture) in a temperature-controlled incubator at 28
◦C. 25 mL
of a 7-day-old pre-culture were then inoculated in 500 mL ﬂaskscontaining 225 mL of 20 g L
−1malt extract broth, supplemented

with dyes as above described. Cultures were incubated in the
dark at 28◦C for 2 weeks on a rotary shaker at 120 rpm. At the
same time, controls consisting of 250 mL of either un-inoculatedliquid culture broth with or without added dyes or inoculated
medium without dye addition were incubated in 500 mL ﬂasks
at 28
◦C. From time to time, supernatant samples were collected
from liquid cultures. The pH was measured and samples were usedfor decolourization assays and for the determination of enzymeactivities.
Assays of dye decolourization by P. chrysosporium and P.
ostreatus
Decolourization in solid media was assessed by visual disappear-
ance of colour from the plate and by measuring diameters ofdecolourization halo and mycelia growth.
Dye decolourization in liquid cultures in micro-titre plates was
monitored spectrophotometrically, measuring, at the third, fourthand seventh day of fungal growth, the variation in intensity of
absorption at the wavelength of maximum absorption of each dye
(λ
maxin Table 1) compared with un-inoculated controls, using a
multi-well plate reader (Benchmark Plus, Bio-Rad, UK).
Dye decolourization in liquid cultures in ﬂasks was daily mea-
sured spectrophotometrically (Jasco spectrophotometer V530,Tokyo, Japan) recording the light absorption spectra between350 and 750 nm and measuring the decrease in absorption in-tensity at the wavelength of maximum absorption of each dye
compared with that of the un-inoculated control. Experiments
were performed in triplicate and values shown are representativeof at least two experiments.
To evaluate the extent of colour absorption on mycelium,
mycelium was ﬁltered, re-suspended in methanol, extracted andcentrifuged, and after this treatment, intensity of absorptionat the wavelength of maximum absorption of the dye inextracted supernatants was measured.
20When adsorption of dyes
on mycelium occurred, decolourization due to the fungal dye
transformation was evaluated by subtracting the colour adsorbed
on mycelium from the measured decolourization.
Enzyme assays
Laccase activity was assayed using 2,2/prime-azinobis (3-
ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) as substrate. Theassay mixture contained 0.4 mmol L
−1ABTS in 0.1 mol L−1sodium
citrate buffer, pH 3.0. Oxidation of ABTS was followed by ab-sorbance increase at 414 nm ( ε=36, 000 M
−1cm−1).
Dye-decolourizing peroxidase (DYP) activity was assayed using
RBU19 as substrate. The assay mixture contained 50 µmol L−1
RBU19 and 0.1 mmol L−1H2O2in 20mmol L−1sodium acetate
buffer, pH 4.0. RBU19 degradation was followed by absorbance
decrease at 592 nm ( ε=9, 000 M−1cm−1).
Aryl alcohol oxidase (AAO) activity was determined using
veratryl alcohol as substrate. The reaction mixture contained4 mmol L
−1veratryl alcohol in 50 mmol L−1sodium phosphate
buffer, pH 6.0. Oxidation of veratryl alcohol to veratrylaldehyde wasfollowedbyabsorbance increase at310 nm ( ε=9, 300 M
−1cm−1).
Manganese peroxidase (MnP) activity was determined using
manganese sulphate as substrate. The reaction mixture contained
0.5 mmol L−1manganese sulphate and 0.1 mmol L−1H2O2
in 50 mmol L−1sodium malonate buffer, pH 4.5. Oxidation
of Mn2+to Mn3+was followed by absorbance increase at
270 nm ( ε270=11, 590 M−1cm−1) due to the formation of
malonate–Mn3+complex.Lignin peroxidase (LiP) activity was determined using veratryl
alcohol as substrate. The reaction mixture contained 2 mmolL
−1veratryl alcohol and 0.5 mmol L−1H2O2in 50 mmol L−1
sodium tartrate buffer, pH 2.5. Oxidation of veratryl alcohol
was followed by measuring the absorbance increase at 310 nm(ε
310=9, 300 M−1cm−1).
All the enzyme activities were measured at 25◦C and expressed
in international units (IU).
Assays of dye detoxiﬁcation by P. chrysosporium
P. chrysosporium (ﬁve plugs of 5 mm diameter from the edge
of a 7 days old mycelium plate) were inoculated in 25 mL of20 g L
−1malt extract broth in 100 mL ﬂasks in the presence
of the lowest dye concentration efﬁciently decolourized by the
fungus in liquid cultures in ﬂasks, and incubated at 28◦Cu n d e r
shaking (120 rpm) for 7 days. Toxicity assays were performedusing Lumistox 300 system (Hach Lange, S. r.l.Milan – Italy) and
performing all measurements in the colour correction mode.
At these concentrations, all the dyes, except DBu1 and DR1,
showed OD values >1800 mE; this high OD values did not allow
Lumistox toxicity assay to be performed. Therefore, for these dyes,dilutions at ﬁnal OD values <1800 mE were prepared and used
for toxicity tests. Toxicity values (percentage inhibition of bacterial
bioluminescence) of dyes at the new deﬁned concentrations weremeasured.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Dye decolourization by P. chrysosporium and P. ostreatus
whole cells on solid media
For decolourization assays 11 dyes were chosen in the frame of
the European Union Sixth Framework Program funded projectSOPHIED (contract NMP2-CT2004-505 899) (Table 1). These dyes
form a representative group including a variety of mono-, dis- and
poly- azo dyes, and three anthraquinone dyes. At least one azodye representative of each primary colour was chosen. They are allcommercially important dyes, with a wide range of applications
across the textile and leather industries. Decolourization of these
dyes by the WRF P. ostreatus and P. chrysosporium was initially
evaluated in solid media, to establish the optimal conditions
for dye decolourization and to verify substrate speciﬁcities of
the fungi. Decolourization was assessed as colour disappearanceduring fungal growth. Extensive growth of the mycelia occurredin both the analyzed growth media: potato dextrose plus yeast
extract containing medium and malt extract containing medium.
Nevertheless, both fungi were shown to be more effective indecolourization on malt extract medium, which was selected forfurther decolourization tests at different dye concentrations up
to 1000 ppm. P. chrysosporium was shown to display a higher
decolourization efﬁciency than that of P. ostreatus .I nf a c tf o rt h e
reactive, direct and acid dyes the former fungus provided completedisappearance of colour after 4–5 days at 30 ppm, 4–7 days at
150 ppm, 5–10 days at higher concentrations. P. chrysosporium
proved to almost completely decolourize all the reactive dyestested up to a concentration of 1,000 ppm after 7 days. On the
other hand, decolourization by P. ostreatus of reactive, direct and
acid tested dyes at minimum concentration took at least 7 days,and a longer time (8–13 days) was required for decolourization athigher concentrations. The colour disappearance observed for the
above mentioned dyes suggested dye degradation following fungi
growth. In ﬁg. 1 the maximum dye concentration decolourized by

70 mm – after 7 days is reported.
Dye decolourization by P. chrysosporium and P. ostreatus
whole cells in liquid media
Decolourization experiments using P. chrysosporium and P.
ostreatus liquid cultures were initially performed in micro-titre
plates using malt extract broth, containing dyes (Table 1) atdifferent concentrations in the range 30–1,000 ppm. Results of dye
concentrations that were at least 50% decolourized after 4 days
are reported in Fig. 2. P. ostreatus was found to be more effective
in decolourizing acid and disperse dyes than P. chrysosporium ,t h e
latter fungus being more active against direct and reactive dyes.
However, both fungi provided reduced of absorbance of RBU19
up to 1000 ppm after only 4 days, and decolourized nearly all the
tested dyes more efﬁciently than in solid media. The different
performances that each fungus displayed during decolourization
experiments in solid media and micro-titre plates could be due toa greater adsorption on mycelia in micro-titre plates, because of
the higher ratio biomass/culture medium.
The decolourization abilities of fungal liquid cultures were
then investigated in ﬂasks at dye concentrations decolourized
with an efﬁciency of at least 50% in the micro-titre plate
tests. For almost all the tested dyes and for both fungi, an
initial delay in decolourization was observed, probably due to
delayed production of the involved enzymatic activities. Table 2
summarizes the percentage decolourization of the selected dyesby the two fungi. The reported percentage decolourization values
are related to the fungal dye transformation, since they have
been calculated by subtracting the extent of colour absorption on
mycelium from the measured decolourization.
It is worth noting that P. ostreatus decolourized some dyes either
through enzymatic oxidation or through biomass adsorption on
mycelium.

by absorption on mycelium. In contrast, the fungus was shown
to be able to decolourize by transforming dis- and tris-azo dyes.Among these, the dis-azo dye AR299 was 40% decolourized in just2 days, reaching 70% decolourization in 13 days. Some dyes weredecolourized after transformation in an intermediate differentlycoloured. Indeed, after only 1 day of fungal treatment, reductionin the absorption peak of the blue dye ABU62 was observedtogether with a shift of wavelength of maximum absorptiondue to transformation of the dye in a red product, that is thencompletely degraded after 6 days. After 3 days of treatment theblue CSB dye was transformed to a violet product, and completelydecolourized after 3 days. After 6 days of treatment the black dye
RBL5 was transformed to a violet product, further transformed
to a pink product in other 7 days, reaching colour disappearanceone day later. The tris-azo black dye DBL38 was decolourized after8 days of treatment, through production of a grey compoundobserved at the sixth day.
P. chrysosporium was shown to be more effective than P.
ostreatus in decolourizing azo, dis-azo and tris-azo dyes. In most
dye decolourization experiments a colour change was observedbefore ﬁnal colour disappearance, the fungus transforming theblue dyes ABu62 and CSB into violet products and DBu1 to ayellow product, the red dyes AR299 and RR4 into yellow productsand the red CR into an orange product; the black dyes RBL5 andDBL38 were converted into red products.
The disappearance or variation of colour was not due to
protonation/deprotonation of dye, since the pH of dye-containingcultures was not altered during fungal growth, remaining almostconstant in the range 5.0–6.0, depending on the dye.
In conclusion P. ostreatus and P. chrysosporium showed different
substrate speciﬁcities in dye degradation, which can be related toproduction of different patterns of oxidative enzyme activities bythe fungi during dye decolourization.
Analysis of oxidative enzyme activities production by the
fungi during dye treatment
The oxidative enzyme activities mainly responsible for dye
decolourization were investigated.
A preliminary analysis of enzyme patterns produced by the
fungi was performed by assaying oxidative enzyme activitiesof 50% decolourized samples (from experiments at dye con-centrations reported in Table 2). The assays showed that P.
ostreatus secreted laccase (2–5 ×10
−1Um L−1), manganese per-
oxidase (1–10 ×10−2Um L−1) and dye decolourizing peroxi-
dase (10−3Um L−1) activities, whereas only manganese perox-
idase (1–10 ×10−2Um L−1) and dye decolourizing peroxidase
(10−3Um L−1) activities were found in P. chrysosporium cultures.
To further investigate the role of fungal enzymes in dye
decolourization, the time course of oxidative enzyme activityproduction during fungi treatment of the dyes at differentconcentrations was analyzed. DyP activity was detected in afew dye decolourization experiments, and for both the fungi verylow activity levels were measured for this enzyme suggesting a
negligible role in dye decolourization. On the other hand, laccase
and MnP were the enzymes produced most abundantly by P.
ostreatus and P. chrysosporium , respectively. Therefore laccase
activity seems to be the oxidative activity mainly responsiblefor P. ostreatus dye decolourization, while manganese peroxidase
acts as the most effective enzyme in dye decolourization byP. chrysosporium .
As a main difference in dye decolourization speciﬁcity between
the fungi, P. ostreatus showed lower efﬁciency of dye degradationagainst the azo dyes compared with P. chrysosporium . Reactive Red
4 and Reactive Yellow 81 were not enzymatically transformed inP. ostreatus cultures, probably due to the low speciﬁcity of fungal
enzymes toward these dyes.
In the case of Direct Red 81, a maximum of 50% dye
transformation was reached and laccase activity was the onlyenzyme activity detected (0.24 U mL
−1) among those measured.
For Disperse Yellow 3, 90% dye decolourization was observed
on the second day of fungal treatment, with 80% due toenzyme transformation (and 10% to dye absorption) and 0.5
Um L
−1laccase activity were detected. However, while the total
decolourization did not change during the following days, dyeabsorption increased to 30 and 70% on the third and sixth day offungal treatment, respectively. At the same time, a reduction ofenzyme activity levels was observed. These results indicated thatlaccases are involved in dye transformation in the early stages.
However, to explain the later increase in color absorption on
mycelium, we hypothesize the production of some other colouredcompounds and their absorption on mycelium.

EC
20(concentration of a sample that causes 20% inhibition in
the luminescent bacteria test) values were determined for ABU62,
DBu1, RBu19, RBl5 and RY81 , but not for AR299, RR4, DR81, CSB,DBL38, since these dyes were not toxic at the required dilution,neither before nor after fungal treatment. Residual toxicity valuesmeasured were expressed as percentage inhibition of bacterialbioluminescence at EC
20. After treatment with P. chrysosporium ,
the most efﬁcient decolourizing fungus, residual toxicity of the
dyes DBu1, RBu19, RBl5 and to a lesser of RY81 was reduced byfungal treatment, decreasing percentage of inhibition by 37-, 57-,119- and 27-fold, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS
This study showed the efﬁciency of P. ostreatus and P. chrysopso-
rium to decolourize a wide range of dyes. P. chrysopsorium proved
to be the most efﬁcient in decolourizing all the dyes tested.Decolourization of mono-azo and dis-azo dyes had previouslybeen demonstrated using P. chrysosporium ,
21 – 23but the reported
systems required longer decolourization times, typically several
days, or required lower dye concentrations. In this work higherefﬁciency and rate of decolourization were demonstrated for thestrain Burdsall M1 (DSM 13 583) of P. chrysosporium which proved
capable of almost complete decolourization of the azo dyes testedup to 600 ppm, and of the dis-azo dyes up to 1000 ppm, after only
6 days, and of at least 80% decolourization of the tris-azo dye DBl38
at 1000 ppm after 7 days. The hypothesis that MnP represents themain oxidative enzyme activity responsible for decolourizationof dyes by P. chrysosporium is consistent with the reported in-
volvement of this enzyme, with or without LiP cooperation, in thedecolourization of dyes by this fungus.
24 – 25
P. ostreatus performed best in decolourizing the anthraquinone
type dyes. The suggested crucial role of laccases in thedecolourization of these dyes by the fungus is in agreement withthe observation reported in the literature that anthraquinonic dyesare good substrates for laccases.
26,27,19
The strain of P. ostreatus was also capable of transforming dis-azo
dyes but not mono-azo dyes. P. ostreatus mediated decolourization
of the latter dyes was mainly due to mycelium absorption. Knappet al .
17and Novotny et al .28reported the ability of a natural isolate

ofP. ostreatus to decolourize various azo and anthraquinone dyes
at 500 and 200 ppm, respectively, contrary to the work of Swamy
and Ramsay,29where no ability to decolourize various azo dyes on
mineral agar medium was detected with this fungus. P. ostreatus
was also reported by Wesenberg et al .30to be a WRF able to
decolourize a wide range of dyes, such as reactive azo dyes,
(poly) and antraquinone dyes. Variations among strains might be
responsible for these differences.
Recent studies reported the oxidation of mono and dis-
azo dyes by puriﬁed laccases from Pycnoporus cinnabarinus31,
Pycnoporus sanguineus32and Pyricularia oryzae33.C h i v u k u l aa n d
Renganathan33demonstrated that degradability of azo dyes by
laccases from P. oryzae depends on their different aromatic
substitution patterns, and that phenol and aniline azo dyes
can be degraded. This work suggests, for the ﬁrst time, theinvolvement of laccases from P. ostreatus in the decolourization
of dis-azo dyes. The ability of P. ostreatus to degrade dis-azo
dyes CSB and DR81 with the involvement of laccases could beexplained by the presence of amino/hydroxy/methoxy and amino
substituting groups, respectively, on the aromatic rings of the
dyes, similarly to that proposed by Chivukula and Renganathan
33
for the degradation of mono-azo dyes by laccases from P. oryzae .
Finally, the potential of P. chrysosporium for use as an effective
dye-detoxifying microorganism has been demonstrated.

Possibilities and limitations of the
investigation of colored samples
in the luminescent bacteria test
New methods for wastewater purification and for the production of new
dyes were investigated. Besides decolorization of wastewater and industrial
applicability, toxicity testing was essential. As a screening, the luminescent
bacteria test is suitable to evaluate the toxicity of colored samples quickly,
and with low costs.

In the framework of the European Research
Project "SOPHIED - Novel Sustainable Bio-
processes for the European Color Industries",
three main goals were pursued:. The biotechnological detoxification and
decolorization of textile wastewaters. The environmentally-friendly biotechno-
logical production of classical dyes and. The biotechnological development and
synthesis of new dyes.
For this purpose and in a project-spanning
work package an evaluation was made of the
newly developed wastewater purification
technologies with regard to detoxification
and decolorization of the dyes with regard to
(eco)toxic properties and industrial quality.
Suitable test methods were chosen to test the
toxicity a nd ecotoxicity of the dyes a nd waste-
waters involved. Thereby the test methods
had to satisfy the following requirements:. Valid methods, which where possible are
oriented on standardized procedures.. Rapid and economical procedures, as the
numbers of samples are large.. Procedures which require little material, as
only limited amounts of sample material
are available.. The procedures must be suitable for the
evaluation of heavily-dyed samples.. Participating partners must be technically
able to establish the procedure in their lab-
oraIoneS"
As the first screening test for the investigation
of the ecotoxic properties the luminescent
bacteria test was chosen. The luminescent
bacteria test is a biotest for the investigation
of the toxicity of environmental samples. lts
application to wastewater is standardized ac-
cording to ISO 11348-2 (2007). The test is
generally recognized and is also recommend-
ed by the OSPAR working group "Whole ef-
fluent assessment" (WEA) as a bacterial test
for the investigation of wastewaters (OSPAR,
2000, 2005, 2007). The test has been used
for many years in standardized form in vari-
ous European countries, (e.9. Belgium, lre-
land, Portugal, Germany, the Netherlands,
Sweden, the UK; OSPAR, 2007) in the frame-
work of wastewater. lts execution is simple
after brief instruction, and it can be carried
out rapidly and economically, and requires
onlysmallsample volumes (= 10 mlor 50 mg).
Colored samples can be measured using color
correction cuvettes or, in newer instruments,
through integrated automatic measurement
and calculation of the absorption.
Methods
The luminescent bacteria test is a biotest pro-
cedure. In this test the cumulative effects of
toxic substances in water can be measured
without any knowledge of the exact compo-
sitron or the ecotoxicity of the individual sub-
stances (EC50 - effect concentration or lC50
- inhibition concentration). The test is based
on the fact that toxins can reduce the normal
luminescence of the marine bacterium Vibrio
fischeri. A reduction of the emitted light is
proportional to the concentration of the
toxins and is measured in a luminometer
photometrically.Colored samples
For colored samples a color correction must
be made, otherwise false positive results may
be obtained, because the dye molecules
physically absorb the light emitted by the
bacteria. The color correction can be done
manually with relatively cumbersome color
correction cuvettes or with a color correction
integrated in the instrument and thus an au-
tomatic color correction. Thereby the ab-
sorption of the sample is first measured in
the wavelength range of the light emitted by
the bacteria (490 nm) before the lumines-
cence of the bacteria is determined. Absorp-
tion and emission are automatically calculat-
ed. In the framework of the project the lumi-
nometer "LUMlStox 300' (Hach Lange
GmbH LPV 321)was used. The color correc-
tion here is made automaticallv.
Preparation of the samples
Wastewater samples can be stored up to 24
hours in the refrigerator al 2-5 oC and two
months at -18 'C (EN ISO 5667-16, 1999).
For shipping, samples must be transported in
insulated packages (e.9. Styrofoam boxes)
with cooling elements or dry ice via an
overnight express courier. The samples must
not be allowed to thaw during transport.
Frozen samples are thawed at room temper
ature before the beginning of the test. Con-
ductivity, pH and optical density (OD) are
measured. lf the pH is between 6 and 8.5, an
adjustment is not necessary. In the other cas-
es, the pH is adjusted with HCI or NaOH to
7 .0 + 0.2. Since the bacteria used are marine
bacteria sodium chloride is added Io 2 o/o,
when the conductivity of the sample is less
than 35 mS/cm. Since the possibility for mak-
ing a color correction is limited, the optical
density of the sample (490 nm) must be max-
imally 1.8. Otherwise this must be adjusted
appropriately through the concentration of
the stock solution or with 2 % NaCl.
Test performance
The test is carried out with the marine lumi-
nescent bacterium Vibrio fisheri . The bacteria
were purchased lyophilized (Nr. Hach Lange
GmbH LCK 484. fhe sensitivity of each bac-
terial batch had already been controlled by
the manufacturer with dichlorophenol. zinc

were transferred to the cuvettes (Hach Lanqe
GmbH LZP 187).
After another 15 min adaptation time the
measurements were begun. Each concentra-
tion was investigated in two replicates. Frrst
the Iight emission without sampie was de-
termrned. Then the sample was added and
incubated for 30 min at 15.C. Then the
light emission t30 was determined. From this,
usrng the LUMlStox Software (Hach Lanoe
GmbH LZV 093), the o/o-inhibition *u, urto-
matically calculated for each sample, taking
into account the color correction as neces-
sary.
Evaluation of results
In the evaluation of the results a correction
factor is determined, which demonstrates
the validity of the measurements. This must
lie between 0.6 and 1 .B; otherwise the meas-
urement is invalid and may not be included in
the evaluation of the results. In addition, the
variation between the two parallel measure-
ments must be under 3olo.
From the %-inhibition data a dose-effect
curve is made and after a probit transforma-
tion using a Maximum Likelihood Approxi-
mation the EC50 is calculated with a confi-
dence interval. In the framework of the in-
vestigations the statistics software ToxRat
(ToxRat-Solutions, 2004) was used.
Validation of test method
Since the test was performed in the frame-
work of the SOPHIED project in several dif-
ferent laboratories, an internal quality control
was developed in order to ensure the validity
and the comparability of the results. For this,
each laboratory made a dose-effect curve
with KrCrrO, in a 2 o/o NaCl solution with thel\4odel wastewater

In a first screening the inhibitory effect of the
dyes was measured at the maximal possible

ly, a curve was measured with the addition of
25 mg/l Direct Red R (CAS No. 573-58-0) in
the same concentration range of KrCrrOr, in
order to test the correctness of the color cor-
rection.
Wastewater
Four model wastewater samples were differ-
ently treated with microorganisms or en-
zymes, in order to obtain a decolorization
and detoxification of the samples (Table 1).
The toxicity of the samples in the lumines-
cent bacteria test was given as a %-inhibi-
tion. Thereby the untreated sample was
measured in parallel as a control, i.e. samples
were tested before and after the treatment.
Dyestuffs
Twelve different commercially available as
well as new textile dyestuffs which were de-
veloped during the project were investigated
in the luminescent bacteria test. The dye-
stuffs were chosen so as to include the four
most important chemical groups of dyes: dis-
persion dyes, reactive dyes, acid dyestuffs
and direct dyestuffs (Table 2). They represent
the most important and most common
chemical structures such as mono-, di- and
trr-azo dyestuffs, anthraquinone and chrom-
ium complex dyestuffs. The dyestuffs were
dissolved in de-ionized water and adjusted to
an OD of approx. 1.8 for an initial screening.
For the chosen dyestuffs the EC50 was de-
termined.
Results
Validation of method
For validation, different concentrations of
potassium dichromate were measured and in
addition with the same concentrations each
fortified with 25 mg/l direct red R. The results
of two exemplary investigations with potas-
sium dichromate and one investigation with
potassium dichromate and direct red R are
presented in figure 1. In both cases the EC50
should lie in the range of 1-10 mg/|.

nescent bacteria test both before and after
the treatment. lt could be clearly seen that
there were differences in the effectiveness of
the different treatment methods with respect
to the toxicity in the luminescent bacteria
test Thls for examnle for the treatment of
the model wastewater "acid dyestuffs" with
P0332 EM, a nearly complete detoxification
is obtained (residual toxicity 1 .1o/o in compar-
ison to the control). For other samples, e.g.
the reactive dyestuffs, in contrast there was
no detoxification (1 02.8%).
Dyestuffs
Altogether a total of '1 2 commercially avail-
able dyestuffs and three newly developed
dyes were investigated in the luminescent
bacteria test. Initially in a screening the max-
imal testable concentration at an OD of ap-
prox. '1 .B was tested and the % inhibition
was measured. Concentrations higher than
1 g/l were not tested. Some of the dyestuffs
were poorly soluble under the test condi-
tions. ln these cases saturated solutions were
made. Undissolved material was removed by
centrif ugation.
For the poorly soluble dyes it was not always
possible to work in the range of the maximalmeasurable optical density, because this val-
ue could not always be reached. The meas-
ured inhibition of the dyestuffs in the lumi-
nescent bacteria test lay in the range of 9.2
to 61 .3 o/o (Table 4). In table 5 the EC50s of
the newly developed dyes can be found,
For selected dvestrrlfs several suitable test
concentrations were investigated in order to
produce a dose-effect curve and to calculate
the EC 50 with the statistics program ToxRat.
Examples of these results are presented in
table 6.
Discussion
Principally the luminescent bacteria test is
well-suited as a rapid and economical
screening test. Despite the photometric
measurement method it is also applicable
for the investigation of colored environmen-
tal samples and substances, when an instru-
ment with color correction is used. Also the
comparison of wastewater samples before
and after a biological treatment is possible.
The investigation with color correction can
be performed with an optical density of up
t^ 1 I Tharohv iho rn.,,- --ncentrauon range
which can be tested has an upper limit.
With darkly colored samples it is quite pos-sible that the toxicities cannot be deter-
mined, because the respective concentra-
tions can no longer be measured at an opti-
cal density > 1.8.
Three of the tested dyestuffs showed no tox-
icity at the highest testable concentration. ln
these cases it is advisable to include another
screening test. Here a Daphnia test could be
chosen, for which the coloration of the sam-
ples plays no role. However the Daphnia test
requires considerable experience, above all in
the cultivation and handling and thus it can-
not be established as simply as the lumines-
cent bacteria test.
For the evaluation of the success of a treat-
ment of wastewater samples the reporting of
the results in %-reduction relative to the con-
trol (wastewater before the treatment) is ap-
propriate. Even when the wastewater does
not react toxically in the luminescent bacteria
test before the treatment, it can show a toxic
effect thereafter because through degrada-
tion processes toxic substances can also be
formed. For the comparison of different
methods the determination of the EC X with
a 95 o/o confidence interval is recommended.
Thereby the differences in the toxicity can be
determined statistically. w
