The effects of the removal of Acid Green 16 (100 mg AG-16/dm3, COD = 111 mg O2/dm3) from 
aqueous solutions by the UV/H2O2 process in UV reactors: low pressure lamp (LP , 15 W) and 
medium pressure lamps (MP , 150 W) are presented. The best results of AG-16 removal were 
obtained for H2O2 250 mg/dm3 (99.85%, AG-16 = 0.15 mg/dm3) and 200 mg/dm3 (99.80%, 
AG-16 = 0.20 mg/dm3) for LP and MP lamps, respectively, with the same parameters, i.e. 
30 min reaction time and pH 6. Under these conditions, the AG-16 solution was completely 
discolored and the COD removal efficiency was 57.3% (LP lamp) and 63,4% (MP lamp). 
However, at optimum conditions of decolorisation, no decrease in the toxicity of solutions 
(Microtox test) was observed. For the MP lamp, the toxicity of solutions remained at the same 
level as in the initial solutions (Toxicity Unit, TU = 3), whereas in the case of the LP lamp, 
the TU value after the process increased to 6. In conclusion, the AOPs for toxic pollutants 
should also be optimised from the point of view of toxicity.

and mutagenic properties in relation to 
aquatic organisms, and in addition they 
can cause irritation and allergic dermati -
tis, as well as being able to act as gen -
otoxins (e.g. Acid Green 16) for mam -
mals [2-4]. For the purification of colour 
wastewater, chemical and physicochem -
ical methods are used such as coagula -
tion, sorption, nanofiltration, reverse os -
mosis and chemical oxidation. The main 
advantages of coagulation are ease of 
use and low investment and operating 
costs, while the disadvantage is the large 
amount of sludge generated [5]. Different 
types of sorbents, both natural and waste, 
are used in the sorption process (apple 
pulp, wheat pods, zeolite, chitosan, saw -
dust, fly ash) [6-8], as well as synthetic 
[9]. The sorption process is highly ef -
fective, but it requires prior removal of 
the suspension from the effluent, which 
is usually associated with higher process 
costs. Alternative methods of removing 
dyes from wastewater are membrane 
techniques such as nanofiltration and re -
verse osmosis [10, 11]. Their main dis -
advantage is high operating costs, and in 
addition they do not degrade the dyes that 
remain in the retentate. Generally most of 
the dyes are found to be resistant to the 
conventional treatment process, and the 
disposal problem of precipitated wastes 
is the main disadvantage of precipitation 
methods [12]. Also chemical oxidants 
(e.g. ozone or hydrogen peroxide) used 
alone are not effective at higher concen -
trations of dyes because of low rates of 
reaction at economically acceptable con - Introduction
Dyes are one of many organic pollutants 
which get into industrial wastewater due 
to their wide application in the textile, 
printing, cosmetics, pharmaceutical, 
food, and other industries. In the course 
of trade, there are more than 100 000 
commercial products containing dyes, 
and their annual production is estimated 
at over 7·105 Mg [1]. Even small amounts 
of dyes present in wastewater give it 
a specific colour. Colored wastewater 
introduced into the aquatic ecosystems 
may cause the inhibition of photosyn -
thesis and lead to toxic effects on aquatic 
organisms. Some dyes have carcinogenic centrations of oxidants. Therefore ad -
vanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are 
increasingly used to remove many dyes 
from wastewater [13, 14]. As a result of 
oxidation with OH · radicals, the dyes are 
substantially degraded, as opposed to the 
methods previously mentioned. AOPs 
such as UV/H2O2 [15, 16] and the Fenton 
reagent [17, 18] are used for the purifica -
tion of colour wastewater. There are also 
studies conducted on, inter alia, UV/TiO2 
and UV/Fe0 methods [19, 20] as well as 
those using alternative sources of hydro -
gen peroxide [21, 22]. Sewage contain -
ing dyestuffs can be treated applying bio -
logical methods using activated sludge or 
a biofilter, which require long retention 
times in the system. Only certain synthet -
ic dyes undergo aerobic decomposition. 
In the case of aromatic compounds, it 
is effective to use biological anaerobic 
methods. Integrated systems operat -
ing under anaerobic-aerobic conditions  
[23-25] are also used. 
This paper presents the results of a study 
on the removal of Acid Green 16 (AG-
16) acid dye from aqueous solutions by 
the UV/H2O2 method. Optimum param -
eters of the UV/H2O2 process (pH, H2O2 
dose, reaction time, lamp type) were cho -
sen, for which the toxicity of the aque -
ous solutions was determined, because 
AG-16 negatively affects mammals and 
may cause long-term adverse effects in 
an aquatic environment. It is not permis -

it into aquatic ecosystems.
 Materials and methods
The solutions simulated were pre -
pared by diluting commercial dye Acid 
Green 16 (C.I. 44025, Boruta-Zachem 
S.A., Zgierz, Poland) in distilled water. 
The dye was of high purity and used 
without further purification. The concen -
tration of the dye was 100 mg/dm3 due to 
the fact that in their earlier dye remov -
al studies the authors had used an initial 
dye concentration equal to 100 mg/dm3  
each time. Thus prepared, aqueous solu -
tions of the dye were characterised by 
an intense dark green color of high clar -
ity, with COD = 111 mg O2/dm3 and pH 
= 7.2. The concentration of AG-16 was 
determined by the spectrophotometric 
method by absorbance at wavelength 
λ=638 nm a using Nanocolor Linus® 
spectrophotometer (Macherey-Nagel, 
Germany). Measurement of absorbance 
for each solution was conducted twice, 
the average value calculated, and the AG-
16 concentration was read from the cali -
bration curve previously prepared. pH 
was measured by the electrometric meth -
od using an inoLab® pH/ION/Cond 750 
pH-meter (WTW, Germany) equipped 
with a SenTix® 81 electrode [27].
The UV/H2O2 process was carried out 
using two flow-through photo-reactors 
with recirculation of treated solutions. 
One of the reactors (Titanium, type AOP 
0.5, Titanium-Wega S.A., Poland, reactor 
working volume = 0.5 dm3, dimension = 
45 mm, height = 420 mm) was equipped 
with a 15W low pressure UV lamp (LP 
lamp) and the second reactor (Heraeus, 
UV-RS-2, UV-Consulting Peschl, Ger -
many, reactor working volume = 0.5 dm3, 
dimension = 60 mm, height = 270 mm) 
with a medium pressure (MP lamp) UV 
TQ 150 with a power of 150W. Aque -
ous solutions with a volume of 0.8 dm3 
were adjusted to a certain pH value with  
1 mol/dm3 NaOH or 9 mol/dm3 H2SO4 
(Chempur, Poland), and then an appro -priate amount of H2O2 (30%, Chempur, 
Poland) was added to them. Aqueous 
solutions of the AG-16 dye were then 
introduced into a reaction vessel (2 dm3) 
placed next to the reactor on a magnet -
ic stirrer, and then fed with a peristaltic 
pump to a UV reactor at a capacity of 50 
cm3/min, from where they were returned 
to the tank. Three reaction times (10, 20, 
30 min) were used. Oxidation reactions 
were carried out successively at pH 3, 4, 5, 
6, 7, 8 & 9, and H2O2 concentrations were 
used in the range of 100-250 mg/dm3. 
For optimum UV/H2O2 process param -
eters, extended studies were performed 
that additionally included COD and 
toxicity. COD was determined by the 
standard dichromate method [28] using 
a CR 4200 thermoreactor and Spectrof -
lex 6100 spectrophotometer (WTW, 
Germany). The COD-determined value 
was corrected for residual H2O2 accord -
ing to Equation (1) , because the  H2O2 
increased the COD value since it acts as 
a reductant (reaction 2), especially in the 
dichromate-based analysis of COD [29]:
CODcorr. = CODm – f × [H2O2];
f = 0.4706 × [ H2O2] – 4.06 × 10–5 × [H2O2]

(2)
The residual amount of H2O2 was de -
termined by the manganometric meth -
od [30]. Toxicity tests were performed 
using the Microtox® system (MicroBi -
oTest Inc., USA) [31] with biolumines -
cent bacteria Vibrio fischeri  as toxicity 
indicators. The contact of Vibrio fischeri  
with a toxic substance causes variations 
in the intensity of light produced direct -
ly proportional to the biological activity 
(toxicity) of the test substance. Test re -
sults indicate the concentration of the test 
substance causing 50% inhibition of the 
bioluminescence of the test organisms 
(EC50). Tests for all samples were per -
formed in 3 replicates, after earlier total 
removal of residual H2O2, using Na2SO3 
(POCH, Gliwice, Poland), as even very 
low concentrations of H2O2 resulted in 
the inhibition of vital activity of bacte -
ria Vibrio fischeri . Wastewater toxicity is 
classified by the US EPA scale, in which 
the toxicity index is TU (Toxic Unit). 
This ratio is obtained by converting the 
toxicity test result (EC50) to acute toxici -ty units TU according to the relationship

 Results and discussion
The aim of the study was to determine 
the most favorable UV/H2O2 process pa -
rameters (i.e., H2O2 dose, initial pH, re -
action time) to achieve the high removal 
efficiency of AG-16 and visual discolora -
tion of aqueous solutions of this dye with 
a concentration of 100 mg AG-16/dm3.  
Preliminary tests showed that visual 
discoloration occurred when the con -
centration of AG-16 dye was reduced to 
<0.4 mg/dm3. Then for the process pa -
rameters appointed, an extended analysis 
was performed including COD removal 
and toxicity tests.
Effect of H2O2 dose
In the studies concerning the impact of 
H2O2 on the efficiency of AG-16 remov -
al, three different irradiation times (10, 
20 and 30 min) were used at an initial 
pH value of 3. In the case of the LP lamp 
for all reaction times, as the H2O2 dose 
(range 100-250 mg/dm3) was increased, 
the AG-16 removal efficiency ( Figure 1 ) 
also increased. With the MP lamp, en -
hancement of dye removal efficiency for 
all reaction times was observed only in 
the range of 100-200 mg H2O2/dm3 (Fig-
ure 2 ). For larger doses of H2O2 (225 and  
250 mg/dm3), the effectiveness of AG-
16 removal was reduced compared to the 
dose of 200 mg/dm3. Probably the excess 
H2O2 in this case acted as a radical scav -
enger OH• (reaction 4), which contributed 
to the reduction in the process efficiency.
OH• + H2O2 → HO2• + H2O  (4)
For both types of lamps, for each H2O2 
dose, AG-16 removal efficiency was 
increased by increasing the reaction 
time. The greatest effect of the doses of 
H2O2 used on the efficiency of the pro -
cess was noted for a reaction time of 
10 minutes. In such an irradiation time, 
using the LP lamp ( Figure 1 ), increas -
ing the H2O2 dose in the range of 100-
250 mg/dm3 resulted in a decrease in 
AG-16 concentration to 6.07 mg/dm3 
(93.9%) and 1.05 mg/dm3 (99%) for 
doses of 100 and 250 mg H2O2 /dm3,  
respectively. A  similar tendency was 
observed for the MP lamp ( Figure 2 ).

of 100-200 mg/dm3 (reaction time of 
10 min) resulted in a reduction in AG-16 
concentration to 9.99 mg/dm3 (90.1%) 
and 1.36 mg/dm3 (98.6%), respectively. 
For both types of lamps and the remain -
ing periods of irradiation time (20 and 30 
min), significantly better decolorisation 
effects were observed with an increase 
in the H2O2 dose, compared with the 10 
min reaction time; however, for the MP 
lamp it was only in the range of 100-200 
mg H2O2/dm3. The results showed that 
the reaction time had more impact on the 
UV/H2O2 process effectiveness than the 
dose of H2O2. In addition, for a 10 minute 
irradiation time, no visual discoloration 
of the test solutions was obtained, regard -
less of the dose of H2O2 and type of UV 
lamp used. On the other hand, extending 
the reaction time to 20 and 30 minutes re -
sulted in a significant increase in AG-16  
removal effects, even if the lowest doses 
of H2O2 were used. Discoloration of the 
solutions at 20 min reaction time was 
achieved at 250 and 200 mg H2O2/dm3 
for LP and MP lamps, respectively. On 
the other hand, 30 min discoloration of 
the solutions was achieved at 200 and 150 mg H2O2/dm3 ,respectively, for LP 
and MP lamps. Based on the results ob -
tained for further experiments (initial pH 
selection), 250 and 200 mg H2O2 /dm3 for 
LP and MP lamps were selected, respec -
tively.
Effect of pH
In the second stage of the study for both 
types of UV lamps, a similar tendency 
of changes in discoloration effectiveness 
was observed depending on the initial 
pH, H2O2 dosage and reaction time. Gen -
erally, in all cases, the use of initial pH 
values greater or less than pH 6 resulted 
in a deterioration or a lack of improve -
ment in decolourising efficiency. For 
LP lamps in the pH range of 3-6, slight 
changes in AG-16 concentration were 
observed in the range of 0.30-0.42 and 
0.15-0.24 mg/dm3 for 20 and 30 min, re -
spectively. At pH 6 for the LP lamp and 
250 mg H2O2/dm3, the AG-16 concentra -
tion decreased to 0.35 and 0.15 mg/dm3  
for 20 and 30 min, respectively. On the 
other hand, increasing the pH above 6 re -
sulted in a rapid increase in AG-16 con -
centration ( Figure 3 ).In the case of the MP lamp, the effect of 
the pH on the decolourization efficiency 
occurred mainly at 20 min of the reaction 
time. In the pH range of 3-6 the concen -
tration of AG-16 decreased from 0.65 to 
0.42 mg/dm3. At pH >6 and 20 min, a de -
crease in AG-16 removal efficiency was 
observed, as was achieved in the case of 
the LP lamp. In contrast, for a 30 min ir -
radiation time, the AG-16 concentrations 
(0.2-0.25 mg/dm3) were almost similar 
throughout the pH range. At a dose of 
200 mg H2O2/dm3 and pH 6, the concen -
tration of AG-16 after 20 and 30 min of re -
action decreased to 0.42 and 0.22 mg/dm3,  
respectively ( Figure 4 ). 
The rapid decrease in process efficiency 
above pH 6 could be due to the fast spon -
taneous decomposition of H2O2 to H2O 
and O2 under these conditions, and thus 
the formation of much fewer OH• radicals. 
Based on the results, it was found that for 
both lamps, the most favorable initial pH 
value was equal to 6. This choice was pri -
marily due to economical reasons, since 
a lower amount of reagents was required 
to reach pH 6 compared to lower pH val -Preliminary tests showed that visual discoloration occurred when the concentration of AG-16 dye 
was reduced to <0.4 mg/dm3. Then for the process parameters appointed, an extended analysis 
was performed including COD removal and toxicity tests. 
Effect of H 2O2dose 
In the studies concerning the impact of H 2O2 on the efficiency of AG-16 removal, three different 
irradiation times (10, 20 and 30 min) were used at an initial pH value of 3. In the case of an LP 
lamp for all reaction times, as the H 2O2 dose (range 100-250 mg/dm3) was increased, the AG-16 
removal efficiency ( Figure 1 )  also increased. With the MP lamp, enhancement of dye removal 
efficiency for all reaction times was  observed only in the range of 100-200 mg H 2O2/dm3 (Figure 
2). For larger doses of H 2O2 (225 and 250 mg/dm3), the effectiveness of AG-16 removal was 
reduced compared to the dose of 200 mg/dm3. Probably the excess H 2O2 in this case acted as a
radical scavenger OH(reaction 4 ), which contributed to the reduction inthe process efficiency.

For both types of lamps, for each H 2O2dose, AG-16 removal efficiency was increased by
increasing the reaction time. The greatest effect of the doses of H 2O2used on the efficiency of the 
process was noted for a reaction time of 10 minutes. In such an irradiation time, using an LP 
lamp ( Figure 1 ), increasing the H 2O2 dose in the range of 100-250 mg/dm3 resulted in a decrease 
inAG-16 concentration to 6.07 mg/dm3 (93.9%) and 1.05 mg/dm3 (99%) for doses of 100 and 
250 mg H 2O2/dm3, respectively. A similar tendency was observed for the MP lamp ( Figure 2 ).
Increasing the H 2O2dose in the range of 100-200 mg/dm3 (reaction time of 10 min) resulted in a 
reduction inAG-16 concentration to 9.99 mg/dm3 (90.1%) and 1.36 mg/dm3 (98.6%), 
respectively. For both types of lamps and the remaining periods of irradiation time (20 and 30 
min), significantly better decolorisation effects were observed with an increase in the H 2O2 dose, 
compared with the 10 min reaction time; however, for the MP lamp it was only in the range of 
100-200 mg H 2O2/dm3. The results showed that the reaction time had more impact on the 
UV/H 2O2 process effectiveness than the dose of H 2O2. In addition, for a 10 minute irradiation 
time, no visual discoloration of the test solutions was obtained, regardless of the dose of H 2O2
and type of UV lamp used. On the other hand, extending the reaction time to 20 and 30 minutes resulted in a significant increase in AG-16 removal effects, even if the lowest doses of H
2O2 were 
used. Discoloration of the solutions at 20 min  reaction time was achieved at 250 and 200 mg 
H2O2/dm3 for LP and MP lamps, respectively. On the other hand,  30 min discoloration of the 
solutions was achieved at 200 and 150 mg H 2O2/dm3 ,respectively, for LP and MP lamps. Based 
on the results obtained for further experiments (initial pH selection), 250 and 200 mg H 2O2/dm3

In the second stage of the study for both types of UV lamps, a similar tendency of changes in
discoloration effectiveness was observed depending on the initial pH, H 2O2dosage and reaction 
time. Generally, in all cases, the use of initial pH values greater or less than pH 6 resulted in a

30 min was chosen for further studies as 
it provided a much greater degree of dye 
removal compared to 20 min.
COD and toxicity analysis
In the third stage of the study, an extended 
analysis of the AG-16 removal process in -
cluding dye concentration, COD removal 
efficiency, and toxicity tests was conduct -
ed. The UV/H2O2 process was carried 
out at initial pH of 6, for 30 min reac -
tion time and H2O2 250 and 200 mg/dm3,  
respectively for LP and MP lamps. 
The analysis of COD changes showed 
that for both types of UV lamps, COD 
values of the aqueous solutions after the 
UV/H2O2 process decreased in compari -
son with the initial solution ( Table 2 ). In 
the MP lamp reactor, better COD remov -
al was achieved (63.4%, COD = 40.6 mg 
O2/dm3) compared to the LP lamp reactor 
(57.3%, COD = 47.39 mg O2/dm3). De -
spite the use of a lower H2O2 in the MP 
lamp reactor, a higher degree of remov -
al of organic compounds, expressed as 
COD, was observed, which may indi -
cate that the UV lamp power is one of 
the most important factors influencing 
the efficiency of the UV/H2O2 process. 
The results of toxicity tests showed that 
initial solutions of 100 mg/dm3 of AG-16 
dye were classified as toxic [32] as the 
toxicity measured (TU) equal to 3 was in 
the range of 1-10 ( Table 2 ). AG-16 deg -
radation in the UV/H2O2 process using 
a UV lamp with an MP lamp (for prede -
termined optimum decolorization condi -
tions) did not change the toxicity of the 
aqueous solution of the dye. On the other 
hand, in the case of the LP lamp system, 
the value of TU doubled compared to the 
initial dye solution. In both cases, these 
solutions could still be classified as toxic 
because the TU obtained was in the range 
of 1-10. 
Despite the effective removal of AG-16 
dye and the decolourisation of aqueous 
solutions, the toxicity of the solutions 
tested was not reduced. This was proba -
bly due to the formation of intermediates 
of AG-16 as a result of the dye decompo -
sition. The possibility of toxic intermedi -ate formation (that sometimes have even 
greater toxicity to primary substrates) 
during the decomposition of pollutants 
(estrogens and dyes, among others) when 
AOP methods are used is confirmed by 
the literature [33, 34]. Moreover Bar -
busiński [35] studied the toxicity of four 
types of industrial wastewater treated by 
Fenton’s reagent and showed that the 
high efficiency of organic component 
degradation (as COD value) was not al -
ways followed by a reduction in toxicity 
to a very low level. In order to achieve 
the total reduction of toxicity in theFen -
ton process, it was necessary to increase 
both the H2O2 dose and reaction time.
 Conclusions
n The best effect of the removal of  
AG-16 dye from aqueous solutions 
using a LP lamp (99.85%, concentra -
tion AG-16 = 0.15 mg/dm3) was ob -
tained for H2O2 250 mg/dm3, a reac -
tion time of 30 min and initial pH og 
6. In the case of the MP lamp, a sim -
ilar effect (99.80% concentration AG-
16 = 0.20 mg/dm3) was obtained for 
H2O2 200 mg/dm3 and the same values 
for other parameters, i.e. reaction time 
and pH. In both cases a visual discol -
oration of the solutions was observed, 
while better removal of COD was 
achieved with the MP lamp (63.4%) 
compared to the LP lamp (57.3%).
n For the best effects of AG-16 remov -
al, no toxicity reduction of the solu -
tions was achieved, and in the case of 
the LP lamp, there was even a double 
increase in the value of TU relative 
to the initial solutions. In order to 
reduce the toxicity of the solutions, 
the H2O2 dose and/or the duration of 
the reaction time should be increased, 
and a UV reactor with MP lamp 
should be used.
n On the basis of the results, it can be 
concluded that in the case of the im -
plementation of AOPs in specific 
wastewater treatment processes, these 
should be optimised not only for the 
removal of pollutants but also for tox -
icity reduction. This requires an exten -
sion of the scope of analysis, also for toxicological tests. This is especially 
important when, for example, waste -
water treated by AOP methods is di -
rectly discharged into natural waters.
n For particularly toxic wastewater, 
the possibility of introducing a wider 
range of toxicity tests should be con -
sidered, e.g. based on Daphnia magna,  
as it is highly sensitive to pollutants.
