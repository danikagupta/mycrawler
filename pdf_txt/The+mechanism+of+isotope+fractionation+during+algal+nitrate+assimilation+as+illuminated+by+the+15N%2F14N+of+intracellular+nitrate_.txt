Abstract
The impact of environmental factors on nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) isotope effects during algal nitrate
assimilation causes uncertainty in the ﬁeld application of sedimentary N isotope records and nitrate isotopes to
understand the marine nitrogen cycle. Ocean acidi ﬁcation is predicted to change nitrogen cycling including
nitrate assimilation, but how N and O isotope effects during algal nitrate assimilation vary in response to
changes in seawater pH and partial pressure CO 2(pCO 2) remains unknown. We measured N and O isotope
effects during nitrate assimilation and physiological states of the marine diatom Thalassiosira weiss ﬂogiiand Syn-
echococcus under different pH (8.1 or 7.8) and pCO 2(400 or 800 μatm) conditions. Low pH and/or high pCO 2
equally decreased N and O isotope effects during nitrate assimilation by diatoms possibly due to reducing cellu-
lar nitrate ef ﬂux/uptake ratio and decreased isotope effects for nitrate uptake, whereas they did not affect those
bySynechococcus with low intracellular nitrate concentration and limited nitrate ef ﬂux. Our results provide com-
pelling experimental evidence showing different changes in N and O isotope effects during nitrate assimilationby marine eukaryotic and prokaryotic phytoplankton at low pH and/or high pCO
2. These ﬁndings suggest new
insight into environmental controls on variability in the isotope effect during algal nitrate assimilation, and
have implications for improving a predictive understanding of N and O isotope tools in acidi ﬁed oceans.
Nitrogen (N) isotopic compositions of oceanic nitrate and
bulk sediments are powerful indicators for evaluating surface
nitrate utilization in the modern and past oceans, facilitating
the understanding of spatial and temporal changes in the
strength of the biological pump (Altabet and Francois 1994 ;
Robinson et al. 2020 ). The key to the application of stable N
isotope tools is to understand the magnitude of the isotope
effect (i.e., a phenomenon associated with the isotopes of a
given element exhibiting different rates during reactions,
which is reported as ε=(lightk/heavyk–1)/C21000, expressed in‰, in which krefers to the speci ﬁc reaction rate constants of
light and heavy isotopes) for nitrate assimilation. On the other
hand, culture studies suggest that nitrate consumption viaalgal nitrate assimilation and marine heterotrophic denitri ﬁca-
tion fractionates N and O isotopes of nitrate to a similarextent (i.e., N and O isotope effects are comparable), resulting
in equal increases in nitrate N and O isotopic composition
(Granger et al.
2008 ,2010 ). This pattern of nitrate N and O
isotopes varying in unison has also been observed in naturalseawaters where nitrate consumption is dominated (DiFiore
et al.
2009 ; Fawcett et al. 2015 ; Rafter and Sigman 2016 ). In
contrast to nitrate consumption, nitrate production via nitri ﬁ-
cation has different effects on the dual isotopes of nitrate; theN isotopic composition of the newly nitri ﬁed nitrate is depen-
dent on the source of N being nitri ﬁed, whereas its O isotopic
composition is mainly set by incorporation of the O
isotopic signals from the ambient water (Casciotti et al.
2002 ).
This difference generally leads to environmental deviations inchanges in O vs. N isotopic composition of nitrate from a tra-jectory of 1 expected for the nitrate-consuming processes*Correspondence: jyyang@xmu.edu.cn ;dshi@xmu.edu.cn

aforementioned. The signature with consistent N and O
isotope effects during nitrate consumption revealed fromculture- and ﬁeld-based studies provides a benchmark for
using coupled nitrate N and O isotope measurements to disen-tangle otherwise overprinting processes that commonly co-
occur in natural oceanic environments (e.g., Wankel
et al.
2007 ; Granger and Wankel 2016 ; Buchwald et al. 2018 ).
Understanding how the changing environmental factors
impact the magnitude and ratio of N and O isotope effects for
nitrate assimilation by phytoplankton could reduce uncer-
tainties in the environmental applications of isotope tracers.Culture experiments have proven advances in providing a
mechanistic understanding of the isotope effect for nitrate
assimilation. For instance, prior studies have investigated thepotential changes in the N isotope effect for nitrate assimila-
tion under different culture conditions, showing that the N iso-
tope effect for nitrate assimilation increased signi ﬁcantly under
light limitation and remained constant under phosphate-,
temperature-, and iron-limited conditions (Needoba et al.
2004 ;
Karsh 2014 ). These results suggest that environmental factors
other than irradiance have insigni ﬁcant in ﬂuences on the N
isotope effect for nitrate assimilation. However, there is little
understanding of how the O isotope effect for nitrate assimila-tion changes with environmental factors. Whether the envi-
ronmental changes would in ﬂuence the invariant coupling of
N and O isotope effects during nitrate assimilation observed inphytoplankton cultures remains equivocal, which requires bet-
ter evaluation for accurate interpretation of environmental
nitrate isotope distributions.
Ocean acidi ﬁcation caused by anthropogenic CO
2input,
referring to an increase in partial pressure CO 2(pCO 2)a n da
concomitant decrease in the pH of seawater, has beensuggested to have appreciable effects on marine biogeochemis-
try and pose a threat to ocean ecosystems (Doney et al.
2012 ).
Among them, the responses of the marine N cycle to oceanacidiﬁcation that are related to shaping the nitrogen pools and
their biogeochemical cycles have been receiving extensive
attention (Wannicke et al.
2018 ). However, little is known
about how nitrate assimilation responds to ocean acidi ﬁcation.
Limited studies have shown that the responses of nitrate assim-
ilation to ocean acidi ﬁcation may vary among phytoplankton
species. For example, acidi ﬁcation slightly reduced the nitrate
uptake rates of the marine diatoms (Shi et al. 2015 ), but pro-
moted those of the dino ﬂagellate Amphidinium carterae (Bausch
et al. 2019 ). The changing physiology associated with nitrate
assimilation by phytoplankton under ocean acidi ﬁcation may
imply changes in its isotope fractionation. The marine eukary-
otic and prokaryotic phytoplankton possess different pathways
of nitrate assimilation, such as different nitrate transporters(NRT) and reductases (Granger et al.
2010 ), possibly resulting
in different responses of the isotope effect for nitrate assimila-
tion under ocean acidi ﬁcation. Additionally, the rising pCO 2
and reducing pH may give rise to different impacts on marine
N cycling processes and algal physiology. For example, Honget al. ( 2017 ) found that growth and N 2ﬁxation rates of the cya-
nobacterium Trichodesmium decreased under low pH condi-
tions, despite a positive effect of high pCO 2. Similarly,
increasing pCO 2for diatoms down-regulated the CO 2-
concentrating mechanism to save energy for growth, while
reducing pH increased the photosynthetic carbon ﬁxation rate
of diatoms (Shi et al. 2019 ). Identifying the interactive effects
of low pH and high pCO 2would help the mechanistic under-
standing of the complex responses of algal nitrate assimilation
to ocean acidi ﬁcation. Therefore, it is worth probing how the N
and O isotope effects during nitrate assimilation by different
phytoplankton species change at low pH and/or high pCO 2.
In this study, the eukaryotic marine diatom T. weiss ﬂogii
and the prokaryotic Synechococcus were cultured under four
different pH- pCO 2conditions to differentiate the effects of
decreased pH and increased pCO 2. These two ubiquitous
pelagic phytoplankton strains are widely used to study the
mechanisms (including intracellular nitrate reduction, nitrate
uptake into cells, and nitrate ef ﬂux from cells) of isotope frac-
tionation during nitrate assimilation (e.g., Granger et al. 2010 ;
Karsh et al. 2014 ). The main goal of this study is to compara-
tively assess the interactive effects of decreased pH and ele-vated pCO
2on N and O isotope effects during nitrate
assimilation for cultures of eukaryotic and prokaryotic strains.
Furthermore, combined with their physiological responses toocean acidi ﬁcation, we discuss the major mechanisms for any
changes in N and O isotope effects for algal nitrate assimila-
tion induced by reducing pH and/or elevating pCO
2based on
culture observations and highlight the implications for ﬁeld
understandings of N and O isotope signals in acidi ﬁed oceans.
Materials and methods
Algal culturing and experimental design
Axenic cultures of T. weiss ﬂogii (CCMP1336) and
Synechococcus sp. CCMP2370 (Provasoli-Guillard National Center
for Marine Algae and Microbiota, USA) were grown semi-
continuously in the ﬁltered and sterilized synthetic ocean water
medium Aquil* under continuous light at 20/C14Ci na nA L - 4 1L 4
algal chamber (Percival Scienti ﬁc, USA) (Sunda et al. 2005 ). The
light intensities were 100 and 45 μmol photons m/C02s/C01for
T. weiss ﬂogiiand Synechococcus , respectively. The irradiance levels
used are characteristic of those prevailing in the lower euphotic
zone and thus relevant to natural environments such asnitracline with nitrate utilization. Nitrate was the only N source,
and its concentrations are shown in Supporting Information
Table S1. The carbonate chemistry of the medium was manipu-
lated by adding different amounts of NaHCO
3/C0with
2 mmol L/C014-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic
acid (Sigma), to obtain the targeted pH and pCO 2levels,
i.e., ambient (pH 8.1, pCO 2400μatm), carbonated (pH 8.1, pCO 2
800 μatm), acidi ﬁed (pH 7.8, pCO 2400 μatm), and ocean acidi ﬁ-
cation (pH 7.8, pCO 2800 μatm) conditions (Supporting Informa-
tion Text S1; Table S2; Shi et al. 2019 ). We implemented sterileChen et al. Isotope effects for nitrate assimilation

culture techniques throughout the experiments to avoid bacterial
contamination.
After being preacclimated to the experimental conditions
for more than 100 generations (corresponding to /C24186 days
forT. weiss ﬂogiiand/C24137 days for Synechococcus ), triplicate
cultures of algae were harvested at /C244 days for T. weiss ﬂogii
and at /C247 days for Synechococcus in the mid-exponential
phase. Cell numbers and volumes of the diatom and Syn-
echococcus were measured daily with a Z2 Coulter Counter and
a Multisizer 4e Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter), respec-tively. Their speci ﬁc growth rates were determined by linear
regression of the natural logarithm of cell numbers vs. time.
Nitrate reductase activity and short-term nitrate
uptake rate
Nitrate reductase (NR) activity was determined by the spec-
trophotometric method (Shi et al.
2015 ). The short-term
nitrate uptake rate was measured by the N isotope labellingmethod (Shi et al.
2015 ). Detailed descriptions of these
methods are shown in Supporting Information Text S2
and S3.
Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and intracellular and
medium nitrate
The cultures were ﬁltered through polycarbonate mem-
branes (1.2 μm pore size for T. weiss ﬂogiiand 0.4 μm pore size
forSynechococcus ) and the ﬁltrate was collected for measuring
medium nitrate and DON. Medium nitrate was determined
using a nitrogen oxide (NO x) chemiluminescence analyzer
(Teledyne) with a detection limit of 10 nmol L/C01(Fawcett
et al. 2015 ). DON was converted into nitrate using the
“persulfate oxidation ”method and estimated by subtracting
medium nitrate (Knapp et al. 2005 ). The intracellular nitrate
was extracted using an ultrasonication method. The cells on
membranes were eluted with a ﬁxed volume of Milli-Q water
(1.1 mL for T. weiss ﬂogii and 4 mL for Synechococcus ) and
disrupted using the Bioruptor (UCD-200, Diagenode), a non-
contact sonicator, followed by centrifugation for 5 min. Wesubsequently measured nitrate in the 1 mL supernatant with a
NO
xanalyzer and calculated intracellular nitrate concentra-
tion accordingly. Considering that the presence of nitrite inthe culture system may in ﬂuence the calculation of the iso-
tope effect for nitrate assimilation (Knöller et al.
2011 ), intra-
cellular nitrite was measured but was not detectable
(i.e., < 10/C04fmol cell/C01). In addition, we randomly monitored
the presence of nitrite using the Griess-Ilosvay reagent duringthe cultures (Becker et al.
2020 ), and found that medium
nitrite was not accumulated in signi ﬁcant concentrations
(</C240.5μmol L/C01). These results suggested that nitrite was
reduced ef ﬁciently in the algal cells during the experiments.
Likewise, previous culture studies on isotope fractionation
during nitrate assimilation by T. weiss ﬂogiiand Synechococcus
under similar culture conditions to our study have shown that
nitrite concentration is generally close to the detection limitin the medium and intracellular samples (e.g., Needoba
et al. 2004 ; Granger et al. 2010 ; Karsh et al. 2014 ). Nitrite was
thus not removed from samples before concentration and iso-
topic measurements.
Isotope analysis
Particle samples from cultures and uptake incubation were
collected onto precombusted GF/F ﬁlters. The N content and
isotope composition on particles were measured using thecontinuous ﬂow elemental analyzer (Vario PYRO Cube) —
isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Isoprime 100) system
(EA-IRMS). Three international N isotope standards, includingUSGS40, USGS41, and IAEA-600, were used for calibration.
N and O isotope composition of nitrate was determined by
the denitri ﬁer method (Sigman et al.
2001 ; Casciotti
et al. 2002 ). Nitrate was quantitatively reduced to nitrous
oxide (N 2O) by denitrifying bacteria lacking N 2O reductase.
The N and O isotope ratios of the N 2O gas were then mea-
sured using a GasBench II connected to an IRMS (Thermo Sci-
entiﬁc DELTA V advantage). Isotope ratios are reported using
the delta ( δ) notation expressed in per mil ( ‰):

where air N 2is the15N/14N standard and Vienna standard
mean water is the18O/16O standard. Sample nitrate δ15N and
δ18O were calibrated using the international isotope standards,
IAEA-N-3 and USGS34. Replicate for individual standards was
< 0.2‰forδ15N and < 0.5 ‰forδ18O.
Isotope effects during nitrate assimilation
To derive the organism-level N and O isotope effects during
nitrate assimilation (15εorgand18εorg; i.e., the net isotope effect
expressed in the environment), the Rayleigh Model for a
closed system was applied to ﬁt the changes in δ15N and δ18O
of medium nitrate (Granger et al. 2004 ):

where fis the ratio of remaining nitrate to initial nitrate, and
δ15Nrem(orδ18Orem) and δ15Nini(orδ18Oini) are the N (or O)
isotope ratios of remaining and initial medium nitrate,respectively.
Statistical analysis
The signi ﬁcance of differences ( p< 0.05, except as other-
wise noted) among four pH- pCO

Results
Growth rates of T. weiss ﬂogii and Synechococcus
sp. CCMP2370 were 1.31 d/C01and 0.49 d/C01, respectively, and
were unchanged at low pH and/or high pCO 2(Supporting
Information Table S3). Both low pH and high pCO 2reduced
the cell volume of T. weiss ﬂogii. By contrast, low pH increased
the cell volume of Synechococcus (Supporting Information
Table S3). Meanwhile, low pH and high pCO 2reduced the C
and N quotas of T. weiss ﬂogiiby a similar extent, while low
pH equally increased the C and N quotas of Synechococcus .
Their cellular C : N ratios thus remained unchanged at low pH
and/or high pCO 2(Supporting Information Table S3). Intracel-
lular nitrate concentration stored by T. weiss ﬂogiiwas/C2432
fmol cell/C01, considerably higher than that by Synechococcus
(0.006 fmol cell/C01). Intracellular nitrate concentrations of both
algae were unaffected under the low pH and/or high pCO 2
conditions (Supporting Information Fig. S1). Low pH slightly
though not signi ﬁcantly decreased the nitrate uptake rates of
T. weiss ﬂogii, whereas low pH increased those of Synechococcus .
Similarly, low pH and high pCO 2did not signi ﬁcantly change
the NR activities in T. weiss ﬂogii, but remarkably inhibited
those in Synechococcus (Supporting Information Fig. S1). The
δ15N and δ18O of the medium nitrate ( δ15N-NO 3/C0
exand δ18O-
NO 3/C0
ex) increased concomitantly over time among all treat-
ments, along with increases in N isotope values in particulate
N (Supporting Information Figs. S2 and S3). The sum of DON
and particulate N was comparable to nitrate consumption(Supporting Information Table S1), suggesting closed systems
during our experiments.
Under the ambient condition (pH 8.1, pCO
2400 μatm),
15εorgforT. weiss ﬂogiiand Synechococcus were 7.8 ‰and 1.9‰,
respectively, and their18εorgwere 8.6 ‰and 2.2‰,r e s p e c t i v e l y
(Fig. 1; Supporting Information Table S3). We found linear
covariations in δ15Na n d δ18O of intracellular and medium
nitrate with ratios of /C241( i . e . , Δδ18O-NO 3/C0

assimilation by two algae (Fig. 1; Supporting Information
Table S3). Compared with the ambient condition,15εorgand
18εorgforT. weiss ﬂogiiwere concurrently reduced at low pH
and/or high pCO 2, whereas those for Synechococcus were
inﬂuenced insigni ﬁcantly under different pH- pCO 2conditions.
Speci ﬁcally,15εorgforT. weiss ﬂogiidecreased from 7.8 ‰to
5.1‰, and their18εorgdecreased from 8.6 ‰to 5.9‰under
the low pH and high pCO 2condition (Fig. 1a;S u p p o r t i n g
Information Table S3). By contrast,15εorgand18εorgforSyn-
echococcus remained at /C242‰in spite of changes in pH and/orpCO 2(Fig. 1c; Supporting Information Table S3). The effects of
low pH and/or high pCO 2led to consistent changes in18εorg
and15εorgfor two algae. Thus, the Δδ18O:Δδ15No f/C241i nt h e
intracellular and medium nitrate was not changed signi ﬁcantly
by decreasing pH and/or increasing pCO 2(Fig. 1b,d).
Discussion
Responses of isotope fractionation during algal nitrate
assimilation to low pH and high pCO 2
The observed15εorgvalues for T. weiss ﬂogii and Syn-
echococcus sp. CCMP2370 grown under the ambient condition
are within previously reported ranges for T. weiss ﬂogii(6‰-
13‰; Needoba et al. 2003 ,2004 ; Granger et al. 2004 ) and Syn-
echococcus (2‰–6‰; Needoba et al. 2003 ; Granger
et al. 2010 ) previously obtained under similar culture condi-
tions. Our results support the fact that marine eukaryotic phy-toplankton expresses higher
15εorgrelative to prokaryotic
phytoplankton (Granger et al. 2010 ). Moreover, we found
Δδ18O-NO 3/C0
ex:Δδ15N-NO 3/C0
exof/C241 during nitrate assimila-
tion by both the eukaryotic and prokaryotic algae, further
conﬁrming the invariant18εorg:15εorgof/C241 as previously
reported in laboratory cultures and ﬁeld studies (DiFiore
et al. 2009 ; Granger et al. 2010 ; Fawcett et al. 2015 ). These
ﬁndings obtained under the ambient condition are consistent
with the current view of isotope fractionation during nitrateassimilation by marine phytoplankton.
This study attempts to uncover the interactive effects of
reducing pH and rising pCO
2on15εorgand18εorg, as well as on
their ratio, by marine eukaryotic vs. prokaryotic phytoplank-
ton. Our results suggest different changes in15εorgand18εorg
by marine eukaryotic and prokaryotic algae under the low pH
and high pCO 2condition, with pronounced changes only by
marine eukaryotes due largely to the effect of reducing pH
(Fig. 1; Supporting Information Table S4). The different
changes in15εorgobserved under the low pH and high pCO 2
condition between eukaryotic and prokaryotic phytoplankton
reﬂect that their regulation of nitrate metabolism is affected in
different ways, as indicated by different physiological
responses of T. weiss ﬂogiiand Synechococcus to low pH and
high pCO 2(Supporting Information Fig. S1; Table S3). These
ﬁndings differ from the consistent impacts of increased pCO 2
on carbon isotope fractionation during inorganic carbon
assimilation by both marine eukaryotic and prokaryotic phy-toplankton, which show elevated carbon isotope fractionation
during inorganic carbon assimilation at high pCO
2by increas-
ing the availability of aqueous CO 2(Gervais and
Riebesell 2001 ; Hurley et al. 2021 ). However, the algae grown
in our experiments was not limited by nitrogen availabilitybecause abundant nitrate remained in the medium
(Supporting Information Table S1). We thus expect other
mechanisms to trigger different changes in
15εorgand18εorgfor
the marine eukaryotic and prokaryotic phytoplankton at low
pH and high pCO 2.Chen et al. Isotope effects for nitrate assimilation

Potential mechanisms of changes in εorginduced by low
pH and high pCO 2
Isotopic fractionation during nitrate assimilation is
suggested to associate with the individual isotope effects for
intracellular nitrate reduction ( εNR), nitrate uptake ( εin), and
nitrate ef ﬂux (εout), as well as the relative proportion of nitrate
efﬂux to nitrate uptake (E/U) (Karsh et al. 2014 ). It can be cal-
culated by (Granger et al. 2010 ):
εorg¼εinþE=U/C2εNR–εout ðÞ ð 4Þ
The εNRpreviously measured for eukaryotic NR (26.6 ‰;
Karsh et al. 2012 ) is signi ﬁcantly higher than the reported εin
and εout(2.0‰and 1.2‰) for T. weiss ﬂogii(Karsh et al. 2014 ).
The εorgis thus mainly driven by isotope fractionation for the
intracellular NR enzyme and is less in ﬂuenced by isotope frac-
tionation associated with cellular nitrate uptake and ef ﬂux. It
is also determined by the degree of its external expression inthe medium through changes in the ratio of nitrate ef ﬂux to
nitrate uptake (e.g., E/U), showing that a lower ε
orgis relatedto lesser ef ﬂux (Needoba et al. 2004 ). However, as the εorg
decreases, εinmay increasingly contribute to the expression of
the isotope fractionation. By considering the key processes in
the reductase-driven model aforementioned, we will assess the
potential mechanisms that affect εorgforT. weiss ﬂogiiand Syn-
echococcus at low pH and high pCO 2, respectively (Fig. 2).
For eukaryotic diatom T. weiss ﬂogii
15εNRcan be obtained by the δ15N difference between intra-
cellular ( δ15N-NO 3/C0
in) and medium nitrate ( δ15N-NO 3/C0

along with the addition of15εorg(Karsh 2014 ):

indicate that εNRofT. weiss ﬂogiiis insensitive to changes in

weﬁnd that15εorgforT. weiss ﬂogiiis tightly correlated with
the δ15N difference between the intercellular and medium
nitrate under various culture conditions, suggesting a constant
15εNRindependent of environmental changes (Fig. 3). All
eukaryotic NRs belong to the sul ﬁte oxidase family of molyb-
doenzymes with similar nitrate reduction mechanisms
(Campbell 1999 ). Previous studies have shown that the εNR
values for the arti ﬁcial reductant methyl viologen from
T. weiss ﬂogii,Pichia angusta , and Arabidopsis thaliana are indis-
tinguishable (27 ‰–28‰), as temperature and nitrate
concentration change (Karsh et al. 2012 ; Treibergs and
Granger 2017 ). Taken together, these ﬁndings demonstrate
that εNRof eukaryotic phytoplankton is invariant in changing
environmental conditions. In this context, we infer that possi-
ble changes in the relative rates between nitrate uptake and
efﬂux and in their isotope effects under the low pH and high
pCO 2condition need to be taken into account.
Given a uniform εNRwith high values, E/U for T. weiss ﬂogii,
which is related to the δ15N difference between intracellular
and medium nitrate, largely determines the εorgmagnitude
(Eqs. 4and 5). Increases in εorgunder light limitation suggestincreases in E/U and hence decreases in δ15N difference
between intracellular and medium nitrate (Fig. 3). By analogy,
we observed that such δ15N differences increased and15εorg
decreased at low pH and high pCO 2in cultures of
T. weiss ﬂogii, implying decreases in E/U (Fig. 3; Table 1).
According to Eq. 4, we could estimate that E/U for
T. weiss ﬂogiidecreases by /C2450%, from 0.23 to 0.12 under the
low pH and high pCO 2condition. On the other hand, the dia-
tom cells may maintain intracellular nitrate homeostasis by
balancing nitrate reduction and ef ﬂux with nitrate uptake.
Based on the rate measurements we ﬁnd that the calculated
E/U for T. weiss ﬂogiireduces from 0.19 to 0.11 under the low
pH and high pCO 2condition, which is comparable to the
isotope-based estimate (Table 1). We thus suggest that both
low pH and high pCO 2lead to decreases in εorgfor
T. weiss ﬂogiiby lowering E/U.
Isotope effects for nitrate uptake ( εin) may make an impor-
tant contribution to the low εorg. The measured εinfor
T. weiss ﬂogiiof/C242.0‰(Karsh et al. 2014 ) can explain at least
25% of εorgin this study (7.8 ‰; Fig. 1). Such a contribution
may increase as εorgdecreases at low pH and high pCO 2. The
εincould be largely determined by the intrinsic isotope effect
associated with nitrate transport into the cell and its rate.

Dehydration occurring in this step breaks the hydrogen bonds
formed between nitrate and surrounding water molecules,
which may be a signi ﬁcant source of isotope fractionation.
Reducing pH in the environment could change cytosolic pHand enhance hydrogen bonds, thus impacting nitrate trans-
port into the cell (Miller et al.
2007 ; Shi et al. 2019 ). This is
seemingly manifested by the slight drawdown of nitrateuptake rate in T. weiss ﬂogiiunder the low pH and high pCO
2
condition. We might infer that decreasing pH and increasing
pCO 2reduce εininT. weiss ﬂogii. Similarly, low pH reduces the
carbon isotope effect of marine diatom S. costatum by affecting
the carbon uptake (Hinga et al. 1994 ).
While the evidence that supports the reduced E/U to
largely cause decreases in εorgforT. weiss ﬂogiiunder the low
pH and high pCO 2condition is convincing, there are some
clues to suggest that decreases in15εinand/or18εinmay also
play a role. First, as E/U decreases and thus εorgreduces, uptake
would make a greater contribution to εorgand in turn deviate
18εorg:15εorgfrom 1 (i.e., increase18εorg:15εorg), due to its
18εin:15εinof/C241.4 (Karsh et al. 2014 ). However,18εorg:15εorg
did not change at low pH and/or high pCO 2(remained at
/C241.1), as εorgdecreased (Supporting Information Table S3). A
plausible interpretation is a concomitant decrease in εin
induced by the effects of low pH and high pCO 2, such that
the proportional in ﬂuence of εintoεorgis roughly unchanged.
Alternatively, relative to15εin,18εinmay be susceptible to
being affected by low pH because more O atoms of nitrate
form hydrogen bonds with surrounding water molecules(Tongraar et al.
2006 ). Reducing pH could induce greater
decreases in18εinand thus a progressive coupling of18εinand
15εin(i.e.,18εin:15εinapproaches /C241), as we observed. Our
ﬁndings for T. weiss ﬂogiicould be indicative of decreases in
both E/U and εincausing lower εorgunder the in ﬂuence of
decreasing pH and increasing pCO 2(Fig. 2a).
For prokaryotic Synechococcus
Unlike T. weiss ﬂogii,εorgforSynechococcus did not change at
low pH and/or high pCO 2. Contrasting responses of εorgfor
two algae to changes in pH and pCO 2could result from their
physiological differences, the key point of which is that pro-
karyotes lacking vacuoles have extremely low intracellularnitrate concentrations and thus impose a stricter control
between cellular nitrate uptake and ef ﬂux (Granger
et al.
2010 ). Lower εorgforSynechococcus may suggest limited
nitrate ef ﬂux and minimal expression of its εNR, hence man-
ifesting a rough similarity between nitrate uptake and N
demand (Supporting Information Fig. S1; Table S3). In this
regard, we could infer that E/U for Synechococcus is
approximately 0 and its εorgis mainly determined by εin.
Lower δ15N-NO 3/C0
invalues were found than δ15N-NO 3/C0
exfor
the Synechococcus cultures, stretching the plausibility of our
argument (Supporting Information Fig. S3). Although low pHpromoted nitrate uptake rate and reduced NR activity in Syn-
echococcus , changes in its ε
NRand E/U can be ignored underTable 1. N and O isotope effects of cellular nitrate reduction (15εNR,18εNR), the δ15N differences between intracellular and medium nitrate, rates of nitrate uptake
(NUR), nitrate reduction (NRR), and nitrate ef ﬂux (NER), and nitrate ef ﬂux/uptake ratios (E/U) for T. weiss ﬂogii. Nitrate reduction rate is determined by a linear
regression of PN concentration vs. time. Nitrate ef ﬂux rate equals nitrate uptake rate minus nitrate reduction rate. All data are mean /C6SD ( n=3). Numbers with

the low pH and high pCO 2condition. However, further stud-
ies are needed to resolve whether εNRchanges with environ-
ments since the reportedly prokaryotic nitrate reductase clade
possesses high variability and expresses heterogeneous isotopefractionations (Granger et al.
2008 ; Frey et al. 2014 ).
While εinfor prokaryotic phytoplankton is not yet mea-
sured, our observations for Synechococcus may imply its εin
close to εorg(/C242‰) and18εin:15εinof/C241. This is consistent
with most ﬁeld and laboratory studies showing that species
with intracellular nitrate approaching 0 express εorgnear15εin
(Karsh et al. 2014 ). Low pH and/or high pCO 2seemed not to
affect εinofSynechococcus , as its εorgwas invariant (Fig. 2). It is
also noted that the presumable18εin:15εinforSynechococcus
is different from that for T. weiss ﬂogii(1.4; Karsh et al. 2014 ).
Eukaryotic and prokaryotic phytoplankton possess different
nitrate uptake systems, with the high-af ﬁnity NRT for
T. weiss ﬂogii (part of NRT2 nitrate –nitrite porters family;
Glibert et al. 2016 ) and the NrtP-type NRT for Synechococcus
sp. CCMP2370 (part of the major facilitator protein superfam-ily; Su et al.
2006 ). In addition, these NRTs transport ions
against the nitrate concentration gradient during nitrate
uptake (Forde and Clarkson 1999 ), which is smaller for Syn-
echococcus with lower intracellular nitrate concentration. We
speculate that the differences in transporters and nitrate con-centration gradients between the two algae may lead to differ-
ences in their
18εin:15εinand further induce their different
changes at low pH and/or high pCO 2. However, the physiolog-
ical mechanisms of how changes in pH and pCO 2affect εin
need to be further demonstrated.Implications for understanding N isotope signals in
acidiﬁed oceans
Knowledge of how εorgresponds to environmental changes
is critical to better understanding the degree of nitrate con-sumption and nitrate N and O isotope distributions in the
ocean. Evidence has shown that ocean acidi ﬁcation has rap-
idly been experienced in coastal seawaters and even in high-latitude oceans (Xue et al.
2018 ; Cai et al. 2021 ), leading to
changes in nitrogen cycling processes (Wannicke et al. 2018 ).
Our observations clearly suggest decreases in15εorgfor
T. weiss ﬂogii at low pH and/or high pCO 2, providing new
insight into the environmental controls on the magnitude of
15εorgfor diatoms as the previous view shows that irradiance is
the sole environmental driver. By comparison, reduced pH
and/or elevated pCO 2would not affect15εorgforSynechococcus .
It is noteworthy that our culturing results for diatoms are con-sistent with the ﬁeld observations in the Southern Ocean. For
example,
15εorgwas found to decrease poleward from 8 ‰to
9‰in the Subantarctic Zone (40 –52/C14S) with high pH to
/C245‰in the Polar Antarctic Zone ( /C2466/C14S) with low pH
(DiFiore et al. 2010 ; Xue et al. 2018 ). The ﬁeld evidence also
supports that besides light availability proposed previously(DiFiore et al.
2010 ), reduced pH may exert an in ﬂuence on
lowering15εorg. Eukaryotic phytoplankton, such as diatoms,
play an important role in contributing to surface nitrate con-sumption and export production, especially in nutrient-rich
oceans (Jin et al.
2006 ; Duret et al. 2020 ). Our ﬁndings of
decreases in E/U for T. weiss ﬂogiiat low pH and high pCO 2
may indicate enhanced ef ﬁciency of nitrate utilization by dia-
toms in future acidi ﬁed oceans. Under projected future climate
conditions, the warming of surface waters will cause shoalingof the surface mixed layer, leading to a decrease in nutrient
supply from deep waters (Doney
2006 ). The enhancement of
nitrate utilization ef ﬁciency by diatoms may facilitate their
growth and contribution to primary production and export, as
also reported in some modeling and experimental studies
(Wu et al. 2014 ; Tréguer et al. 2018 ).
On the other hand, the higher degree of nitrate consumption
leads to higher N isotope values in particulate N and sediments
(Altabet and Francois 1994 ). However, decreases in15εorgfor dia-
toms observed at low pH and/or high pCO 2would complicate
the quanti ﬁcation of these changes, and thus require consider-
ation in interpreting N isotope data in diatom-dominated, acidi-ﬁed oceans. It is also worth noting that the coherent effects of
pCO
2on15εorgmerit further investigation conducted on various
algal species using a series of CO 2concentrations, which would
alleviate uncertainties in reconstructing past changes in nitrate
utilization and thus the strength of the biological pump in high-
latitude oceans during the glacial –interglacial CO 2variations
(e.g., Robinson et al. 2004 ;S t u d e re ta l . 2015 ) and the high-
pCO 2periods (e.g., the Plio-Pleistocene transition with pCO 2of
/C24500 μatm; Bai et al. 2015 ).
While the combined effects of decreased pH and increased
pCO 2signiﬁcantly lower the magnitude of15εorgforT. weiss ﬂogii,

natural marine assemblages is needed to test the representative-
ness of our observations. This study also highlights the need forsystematic studies to assess the effects of seawater pH and pCO
