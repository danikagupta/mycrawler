Characterization and application of surface-molecular-
imprinted-polymer modi ﬁed TiO 2nanotubes for removal
of per ﬂuorinated chemicals
Lei Hu, Yi Li and Wenlong Zhang
ABSTRACT
The removal of per ﬂuorinated chemicals (PFCs) during wastewater reclamation is a great concern.
However, the existing advanced treatment processes are inef ﬁcient for the removal of PFCs from
secondary ef ﬂuents of municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) because other coexistent
pollutants with less environmental signi ﬁcance are removed simultaneously. Therefore, research on
high-selectivity, low-cost removal methods is needed. The S-MIP-TiO 2nanotube (NT) photocatalysts
were fabricated, characterized and tested for removal of PFCs from wastewater for the ﬁrst time.
Scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy show that the TiO 2NTs
(average diameter 60 nm) were successfully imprinted with functional groups (i.e. carboxyl). Theadsorption selectivity and photocatalytic activity of the S-MIP-TiO
2NTs over per ﬂuorooctanoic acid
(PFOA) were improved compared with neat TiO 2NTs and interestingly, were higher at low PFOA
concentrations (10 to 100 ng/L, as normal PFC concentrations in secondary ef ﬂuents) than at high
concentrations (10 to 1,000 mg/L). With S-MIP-TiO 2NTs used as photocatalysts, some representative
PFCs were selectively and rapidly removed from secondary ef ﬂuents of a municipal WWTP. S-MIP-
TiO 2NTs exhibited excellent regeneration performance. Thus, photocatalytic treatment using is
promising for effective removal of PFCs from secondary ef ﬂuents of municipal WWTPs.Lei Hu

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, wastewater reclamation from municipal
wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has been employedworldwide for various purposes, including landscape irriga-tion, impoundment, crop irrigation, and groundwater
recharge to overdrawn aquifers ( Zhang et al. ). However,
many types of pollutants still exist in the ef ﬂuents of munici-
pal WWTPs after traditional treatment ( Gupta et al. b,
a). Among them, per ﬂuorinated chemicals (PFCs) are
at mean concentrations from ng/L to μg/L. Some PFCs,
such as per ﬂuorinated acid, are included in the European
Union list of priority pollutants. These chemicals even at
trace levels can induce extensive reproductive and sexualabnormalities in wildlife ( Radjenovic et al. ). Thus, the
removal of these PFCs during wastewater reclamation is a
great concern.
Many methods, such as activated carbon adsorption,
ozonation, UV radiation, UV/H
2O2degradation, andphoto-degradation, have been developed to remove PFCs
from wastewater ( Zhang et al. ). Among them, activated
carbon has been widely applied to remove organic mattersfrom wastewater owing to its strong af ﬁnity to adsorb even
low-concentration organic substances ( Ali & Gupta ;
Gupta et al. ,;Gupta & Ali ;Gupta et al.
a). Photo-degradation is an environmentally friendly
technique since it does not require chemical input or
output ( Gupta et al. ,b,b). TiO
2is the most
common photocatalyst due to its capability in removal of a
wide range of pollutants, and shows other advantages
including high photochemical stability, low toxicity andlow-cost ( Gupta et al. a,a).
However, the presence of low-level PFCs is
accompanied by high levels of other low-toxicity biodegrad-able pollutants in secondary ef ﬂuents of municipal WWTPs
(Saadi et al. ). Current advanced treatment processes1417 © IWA Publishing 2016 Water Science & Technology |74.6|2016

are inef ﬁcient for PFCs removal because other pollutants
with less environmental signi ﬁcance were also removed sim-
ultaneously, which decreases the removal ef ﬁciency of PFCs
and increases treatment costs ( Czili & Horvath ). For
these reasons, the research for highly selective and low-
cost removal methods is still warranted.
Molecular imprinting is a useful technique for the prep-
aration of polymeric materials as speci ﬁc molecular
recognition receptors ( Piletsky et al. ;Haupt ).
Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are prepared bycopolymerization of a cross-linking agent with the complex
formed from a template and polymerizable monomers that
have functional groups speci ﬁcally interacting with the tem-
plate through covalent or non-covalent bonds. After the
template is removed from the resulting polymer matrixes,
binding sites having the size and shape complementary tothe template are generated. These MIPs are synthesizedwith ‘tailor-made ’binding sites for a template ( Haupt
). Recently, MIPs have been utilized for the selective
removal of per ﬂuorinated compounds from water ( Meng
et al. ;Le Noir et al. ;Zhang et al. ).Meng
et al. () suggested that MIPs with per ﬂuorinated acid
as template might be used to remove per ﬂuorinated com-
pounds from water. Le Noir et al. () employed MIPs,
based on bulk polymerization approach, to remove trace
perﬂuorinated acid from aqueous solution using MIPs
adsorbent column. Tran et al. () used molecularly
imprinted polymeric microspheres to remove phenolic estro-
gen pollutants from different sources of water. The results ofthe above studies show that MIPs adsorption is an effectivemethod for the selective removal of trace targeted per ﬂuori-
nated compounds from water.
However, adsorption is a non-destructive removal tech-
nology and MIPs need to be regenerated and reused for a
lower treatment cost ( Sansotera et al. ). The related
research concerning simultaneous adsorption of per ﬂuori-
nated compounds and polymer regeneration are very
limited. Only recently, UV irradiation was used as a
method to regenerate MIPs and destroy pollutants during
solvent extraction ( Jinget al. ). It has been reported in
our previous research that TiO 2photocatalysis is more effec-
tive for the removal of per ﬂuorinated compounds and
perﬂuorinated activity from secondary ef ﬂuents than UV
irradiation ( Zhang et al. ). However, to the best of our
knowledge, there is no existing report regarding the selective
removal of per ﬂuorinated compounds using the technology
combining of MIPs adsorption and TiO 2photocatalysis.
The main objective of this work was, therefore, to develop
new surface-MIP-modi ﬁed TiO 2(S-MIP-TiO 2)n a n o t u b e( N T )photocatalysts to achieve selective removal of per ﬂuorinated
compounds from secondary ef ﬂuents and simultaneous regen-
eration of polymers. The material characteristics, adsorptionproperties, and photocatalytic activity of the photocatalysts
were investigated in details. The photocatalytic removal of
PFCs and per ﬂuorinated activity from practical secondary
efﬂuent using S-MIP-TiO
2NTs were also evaluated.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Reagents
The titanium sheets (99.60%, 0.06 mm thick) were pur-
chased from Haiji Ltd for Titanium & Nickel, China. Theﬁve per ﬂuorinated compounds [hepta ﬂuorobutyric acid
(PFBA), per ﬂuorovaleric acid (PFPeA), undeca ﬂuorohexa-
noic acid (PFHxA), per ﬂuoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), and
pentadeca ﬂuorooctanoic acid (PFOA)], methacrylic acid
(MAA), trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate (TRIM), and
4,4 ’-azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid) (AIBN) were all purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (USA) and used without further puri ﬁ-
cation. TRIM was of technical grade and all other reagents
used were of high-performance liquid chromatography(HPLC) grade. Analytical standards for chromatographyanalyses were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA).
Preparation of TiO
2NTs and S-MIP-TiO 2NTs
TiO 2NTs were prepared according to previous work ( Su
et al. ). Prior to anodization, titanium sheets were ultra-
sonically cleaned in acetone and deionized water. The
cleaned titanium sheet was anodized at 20 V in an electro-lyte containing 0.5 wt% NH
4F and 1/12 M C 2H2O4·2H 2O
at room temperature for 10 min in a two-electrode system
with a nickel cathode. To induce crystallinity, the initiallyamorphous as-anodized sample was annealed at 500
WC for
120 min with heating and cooling rates of 2WC·min/C01.
The MIP was prepared by precipitation polymerization
method. The template (PFOA, 0.18 mmol) was ﬁrst added
into a bottle containing a mixture of solvent (anhydrous
acetonitrile, 10 mL) and functional monomer (MAA,0.87 mmol), and sonicated for 5 min at ambient tempera-ture. The cross-linker (TRIM, 1.90 mmol) and initiator
(AIBN, 0.0071 mmol) were then added into the solution.
The solution was mixed uniformly by sonication for 5 min,and then was slowly dropped on two sides of TiO
2NTs to
get a uniform coating. Afterwards, the coated-TiO 2NTs
were ﬁxed in the columniform quartz tube. The tube was1418 L. Hu et al. |Characterization and application of S-MIP NTs for removal of PFCs Water Science & Technology |74.6|2016

on 11 February 2021then sealed and purged with nitrogen for a further 20 min.
Polymerization was carried out under UV light irradiation
for 12 h. Then the coated-TiO 2NTs were washed with a mix-
ture of methanol and acetic acid (volume ratio of 9:1) for
four times, and each at a duration of 1.5 h. Then, the nano-
tube array was washed with methanol for 24 h. This wasfollowed by extractions with methanol until no PFOA wasdetected in the eluates. The non-imprinted polymer (NIP)
modi ﬁed TiO
2nanotubes were synthesized and treated in
the same way except that no template was added.
Characterization
The morphological characters of the samples were investi-
gated using ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscope
(Hitachi, Model S-4800). The completion of the reaction inthe preparation of the MIPs modi ﬁed NTs was demonstrated
by FD-5DX Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR).
The crystal phases were determined by X-ray diffractometer(XRD, M21X, MAC Science Ltd, Japan) with Cu-K
α
radiation.
Apparatus and methods for adsorption and
photocatalytic degradation
The adsorption of PFOA on MIP-TiO 2NTs, NIP-TiO 2NTs
and TiO 2NTs were performed by placing these samples in
the solutions (300 mL) at different concentrations of
PFOA (varied from 10 to 109ng/L). The whole process
went on with continuous magnetic stirring for 2 h in thedark at room temperature. The amount of adsorbed PFOA
was determined by measuring the difference between total
PFOA amount and residual amount in solution.
The photocatalytic experiments were conducted in a
water-jacketed cylindrical quartz photocatalytic reactor
(60 cm height, 18 cm outer diameter, and 15 cm inner diam-eter) in the presence of the photocatalysts with the active
area 400 cm
2/L. The double-walled glass reservoir was
equipped with a thermostatically controlled water ﬂow
between the outer walls. The aeration system at the
bottom of the reactor was installed to improve mixing and
mass transfer to the catalyst. An 8 W, low-pressure mercuryUV lamp (Beijing Lighting Research Institute, ZW8S15W)with irradiating wavelength 254 nm as the light source was
immersed in the photocatalytic reactor. Under the same
conditions as in the photocatalytic experiments, the totaluseful radiation arriving to the reactor was determined to
be 7.38 ×10
/C08Einstein·s/C01by chemical actinometry using
potassium ferrioxalate ( Sun & Bolton ). After thesolution was stirred for 40 min to favor the organic adsorp-
tion onto the catalyst surface, the concentration of the
pollutant was determined as the initial concentration, andthen the irradiation started. The solution was sampled for
analysis from the reactor cell using a glass syringe at speci-
ﬁed time intervals during degradation.
Analytical methods
The concentrations of PFOA in ultrapure water were deter-
mined using liquid chromatography –mass spectrometry
(LC-MS) equipped with electrospray interface (HP 1100LC-MS
nTrap SL System, Agilent, USA) in negative ioniz-
ation mode for isolation of m/z 271 ([M-H]/C0ion). During
the process, the mobile-phase composition was methanol/water 75/25 (v/v) at a ﬂow rate of 0.18 mL·min
/C01. Stop
time was set to be 6 min.
To determine the PFCs in secondary ef ﬂuents, solid
phase extraction (SPE) method was applied to concentrate
the compounds from the wastewater sample using Oasis
HLB resin cartridges (Waters Corporation, USA) previouslywashed with 10 mL of ethyl acetate, 10 mL methanol,
and 15 mL ultrapure water. The dried eluate post SPE
were derived with 100 μL pyridine and 50 μLN,O-bis
(trimethylsilyl) tri ﬂuoroacetamide solution containing 1%
trimethylchlorosilane (Sigma) at 70
WC for 60 min, followed
by cooling down to room temperature.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Characterization of as-prepared photocatalyst
The surface morphologies of TiO 2NTs and S-MIP-TiO 2NTs
are shown in Figure 1 .N e a tT i O 2NTs ( Figure 1(a) )w e r ec o m -
posed of well-ordered and uniform TiO 2nanotubes, with pore
sizes ranging from 55 to 75 nm, and the average pore size of
approximately 60 nm, and a wall thickness of approximately
14 nm. Most S-MIP-TiO 2NTs ( Figure 1(b) ) were still open at
the top end, similar with the TiO 2NTs. In the process of
MIP modi ﬁcation, the mixture was supposed to diffuse down
the length of the hollow core of the NTs. Hence, the inside sur-face of the NTs was modi ﬁed with a thin MIP layer, decreasing
the average diameter from approximately 60 to 50 nm.
Compared with TiO
2NTs ( Figure 2(a) ), the IR spectrum
of the TiO 2NTs with a PFOA-imprinted layer ( Figure 2(b) )
had the characteristic peaks of PFOA at 3,446, 3,240, 2,930,
2,864, 1,590, and 1,250 cm/C01(Cakmak et al. ), and the
characteristic peaks of MAA at 1,650 and 1,820 cm/C011419 L. Hu et al. |Characterization and application of S-MIP NTs for removal of PFCs Water Science & Technology |74.6|2016

on 11 February 2021(Martínez et al. ). After removing PFOA using methanol
and acetic acid, the characteristic peaks assigned to PFOA
disappeared. In contrast, the characteristic peaks assignedto MAA were still clearly observed ( Figure 2(c) ). This result
indicated that the functional monomer of the target molecule
PFOA was successfully imprinted on the surface of TiO
2NT.
Both the XRD spectra of the neat TiO 2NTs ( Figure 3(a) )
and S-MIP-TiO 2NTs ( Figure 3(b) ) exhibited clear character-
istic diffraction peaks at 25.34W, 37.84W, 48.02W, 53.00W,
55.02W, 62.86W, 70.58W, and 76.24W, which were assigned
to the anatase phase. The XRD patterns revealed the crystal-
lization of TiO 2NTs was not affected by the surface
molecular imprinted process.
Adsorption of the template molecules
The adsorption of the template compounds PFOA on
S-MIP-TiO 2NTs, NIP-TiO 2NTs, and TiO 2NTs are showninFigure 4 . The adsorption isotherms were described by
the Freundlich isotherm model ( Qe¼KfCe1/n). In this
model, Qeis the amount of PFOA adsorbed per unit active
surface area of the photocatalysts (mg·cm/C02),Ceis the con-
centration of PFOA in solution (ng·L/C01),Kfis the
adsorption equilibrium constant representative of the
adsorption capacity, and 1/ nis a constant indicative of the
adsorption intensity. The values of the parameters arelisted in Table 1 . In the investigated concentration range,
1/n of the S-MIP-TiO
2NTs (0.2711) was higher than that
of the NIP-TiO 2NTs (0.1754) and TiO 2NTs (0.1187). K f
of the S-MIP-TiO 2NTs was 3.89, higher than those for
NIP-TiO 2NTs and TiO 2NTs (2.04 and 1.65, respectively).
These results indicated that the adsorption capacity and
intensity of both S-MIP-TiO 2NTs and NIP-TiO 2NTs were
enhanced during the precipitation polymerization process.
The S-MIP-TiO 2NTs had the highest adsorption capacity
and intensity among the three photocatalysts.

on 11 February 2021According to the adsorption isotherms, an adsorption
hypothesis involving three types of potential binding siteson the surface of the modi ﬁed photocatalyst was proposed
as shown in Figure 5 . For binding site type 1, only the tem-
plate molecules could be bound theoretically because the
binding sites require not only speci ﬁc functional groups,
but also matching target molecule sizes. Binding site type
2 could occur both speci ﬁc by speci ﬁc functional group rec-
ognition and non-speci ﬁc adsorption via hydrogen bonding.
Binding site type 3 could occur non-speci ﬁc adsorption via
hydrogen bonding. After polymerization, some functional
monomers that do not form complexes could remain onthe surface of the polymer. These monomers provide the
possibility of non-speci ﬁc adsorption via hydrogen bonding.
Three types of potential binding sites could be formed on thesurface of S-MIP-TiO
2NTs, and one type (type 3) on the sur-
face of the NIP-TiO 2NTs.
In general, the Freundlich model is suitable for assessing
the adsorption isotherm of S-MIP-TiO 2NTs. However, in the
current study, the Freundlich model yielded a worse ﬁt for the
adsorption isotherm of PFOA on S-MIP-TiO 2NTs ( R2¼
0.9361) than in previous studies ( R2/C210.99) ( Zhang et al.
). This discrepancy can be explained by the fact thatthe investigated adsorption concentration range (from
10 ng/L to 1,000 mg/L) was much wider than those in pre-
vious studies (from 1 to 1,000 mg/L) ( Zhang & Hu ).
The adsorption isotherms of PFOA on S-MIP-TiO 2NTs are
shown in Figure 4 . It could be found that the Freundlich
model constant 1/n at low concentrations of PFOA (from10 to10
5ng/L) was higher than that at high concentrations
(from 106to 109ng/L). It indicated that the adsorption inten-
sity of PFOA on S-MIP-TiO 2NTs at low concentrations (from
10 to 105ng/L) was higher than that at high concentrations
(from 106to109ng/L). According to the adsorption hypoth-
esis proposed in this study, the adsorption of template
compounds on the S-MIP-TiO 2NTs had two different adsorp-
tion mechanisms, i.e. functional group recognition and
interaction between πelectrons. The attractive force of func-
tional group recognition between carboxyl and phenolichydroxyl is stronger than the interaction force between πelec-
trons in the phenol aromatic ring and in the cross-linker
(Wang et al. ;Anet al. ;Alizadeh & Akhoundian
). Therefore, the adsorption of low concentration PFOA
on S-MIP-TiO
2NTs most resulted from functional group rec-
ognition (potential binding sites 1 and 2). In contrast, the
weak interaction forces (potential binding site 3) were themajor adsorption mechanism at high concentrations of
PFOA. It can be deduced that the functional group recog-
nition exhibited higher adsorption intensity towards thetemplate molecules than weak interaction.
Photocatalytic removal of the template molecules
The photocatalytic degradation activities of the S-MIP-TiO
2
NTs, NIP-TiO 2NTs, and TiO 2NTs were evaluated in an
aqueous PFOA solution. The photocatalytic reaction kin-
etics followed the Langmuir –Hinshelwood model ( Zhang
et al. ).

where C0andCare the concentrations of PFOA at the begin-

irradiation experiments also followed a pseudo- ﬁrst-order
kinetics ( Sansotera et al. ). As shown in Figure 6 , the appar-
entﬁrst-order rate constant kappin a different process can be
easily calculated: 0.0040 min/C01in the photolysis process,
0.0225 min/C01for the TiO 2NTs, 0.0316 min/C01for the NIP-
TiO 2NTs, and 0.0732 for the S-MIP-TiO 2NTs in the photoca-
talytic process, respectively. These results indicated that TiO 2
photocatalysis was more ef ﬁcient than direct photolysis for
PFOA removal, and the photocatalytic degradation processwas enhanced with the presence of the MIP layer.
In this process, the photocatalytic reaction started with
the adsorption of the template compound moleculesPFOA on the MIPs layers located on the surface TiO
2
NTs. Then the adsorbed PFOA molecules were oxidizedby the generated OH radicals during photocatalysis.Therefore, the photocatalytic degradation rate strongly
depended on the amount of PFOA adsorbed on the photo-
catalyst surface, and on the amount of OH generated
during photocatalysis, as shown in Equation (4). It has
been con ﬁrmed that the adsorption capacity and intensity
of PFOA on S-MIP-TiO
2NTs was higher than TiO 2NTs,
although the incident light would be hindered by MIPs
layer on the surface of TiO 2NTs, and thus hinder the OH
generation during S-MIP-TiO 2photocatalysis ( Liuet al.
). Therefore, the enhanced photocatalytic degradation
should result from the enhanced adsorption capacity and
intensity despite the negative effects of MIPs layer.
The effect of concentration on the photocatalytic degra-
dation rate of PFOA was also investigated. As shown in
Figure 7 , when the initial PFOA concentration increased
from 102ng/L to 109ng/L, kappof PFOA degradation
decreased from 0.784 to 0.071 min/C01using the S-MIP-TiO 2
NTs, and from 0.109 to 0.029 min/C01using the TiO 2NTs.
The ratio of the k values using S-MIP-TiO 2NTs to TiO 2
NTs was decreased from 7.19 to 2.45. The result indicated

on 11 February 2021that the degradation selectivity of S-MIP-TiO 2NTs towards
the template compounds (PFOA) was increased as the initial
concentration of PFOA was decreased, which would behelpful for the selective removal of the low-level template
compounds in wastewater.
Based on the above analysis, the S-MIP-TiO
2NTs not
only exhibited outstanding adsorption capacity and photoca-talytic activity toward the template compounds, but also had
higher adsorption intensity and photocatalytic selectivity at
low concentrations than that at high concentrations. There-fore, photocatalytic treatment using S-MIP-TiO
2NT as
photocatalysts may be a promising approach for the removal
of trace per ﬂuorinated compounds from secondary ef ﬂuents.
Photocatalytic removal of PFCs
The feasibility of applying S-MIP-TiO 2NTs for the selective
removal of per ﬂuorinated compounds from wastewater was
evaluated by investigating the photocatalytic removal ef ﬁ-
ciency of ﬁve per ﬂuorinated compounds (PFBA, PFPeA,
PFOA, PFHxA, and PFHpA) from the secondary ef ﬂuents
of a municipal WWTP as shown in Figure 8 . The initial con-
centration of ﬁve PFCs was 10 μg/L. These compounds were
chosen as the representative chemicals to be detected in the
secondary ef ﬂuents because of their wide occurrence and
high potential toxicity.
It is known that the photocatalytic degradation process
can be divided into two stages, i.e. adsorption and photoca-talytic degradation phases. In adsorption phase (0 –40 min),
the functional group recognition was the major adsorption
mechanism because the concentrations of PFCs in second-ary ef ﬂuent range from ng/L to μg/L. As shown in
previous work, the functional group recognition is the
chemical interaction between the functional groups ( –OH)in target molecules and the footprints groups (carboxyl) in
polymer. Therefore, the compounds comprising the func-
tional groups in their molecules (such as PFBA, PFPeA,PFHxA, and PFHpA) were chemically adsorbed on the sur-
face of S-MIP-TiO
2NTs, resulting in an enhanced
photocatalytic degradation and a rapid removal of PFCs.In comparison, the compounds without these functionalgroups were not enhanced adsorbed and degraded during
the same process.
The pH value of the solution is an important parameter,
which affects the adsorption behavior of the ion in many
cases. The adsorbent surface was charged through the proto-
nation of functional groups and the electrostatic attractionbetween adsorbents and adsorbates usually plays a major
role. It can be found that the adsorption is pH dependent,
and the adsorption amount of PFOA decreased withincreasing solution pH value. Therefore, the electrostaticinteraction played an important role in the sorption process
at acidic pH values. With increasing solution pH, the
adsorption amount of the MIPs and NIPs adsorbents forPFOA decreased. It indicated that the adsorption of PFOA
onto the MIPs and NIPs adsorbents was mainly attributed
to the electrostatic attraction Other forces including hydro-phobic interaction and hydrogen binding may be involved
in the adsorption in the whole pH range, but their contri-
butions are limited in this study. It also can be found thatthe MIPs adsorbents had higher sorption capacity than
that of the NIPs adsorbents at pH values from 4 to 6, show-
ing the good selective adsorption. The initial pH value of thesolution is 5 in this work.
The S-MIP-TiO
2NTs were also reused to test its stability
for the removal of per ﬂuorinated activity from the secondary
efﬂuents. It was found that the removal ef ﬁciency was
slightly reduced after each use and ﬁnally stable at about
82% after ﬁve cycles. The result indicates that photocatalytic
treatment using S-MIP-TiO 2NTs could be a promising
approach for effectively eliminating PFCs from secondary
efﬂuents of municipal WWTPs.
CONCLUSIONS
Surface-molecular-imprinted polymer-modi ﬁed TiO 2nano-
tube (S-MIP-TiO 2NT) photocatalysts were prepared. The
MIP layer provided the neat TiO 2NTs with selective mol-
ecular adsorption ability, leading to outstanding adsorptioncapacity and intensity and enhanced photocatalytic selectiv-
ity and activity over PFOA. Moreover, the modi ﬁed
photocatalysts exhibit higher adsorption intensity and

concentrations.
The photocatalytic removal of PFCs and per ﬂuorinated
activity from secondary ef ﬂuents of a municipal WWTP
was considerably enhanced using S-MIP-TiO 2NTs than
using TiO 2NTs. The S-MIP-TiO 2NTs developed here also
exhibit excellent regeneration performance. Therefore,photocatalytic treatment with S-MIP-TiO
2NTs could be a
promising approach for effective elimination of PFCs from
secondary ef ﬂuents of municipal WWTPs. This method
would help to reduce ecological risk during wastewater
reclamation.
