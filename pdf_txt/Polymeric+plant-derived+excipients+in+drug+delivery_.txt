Abstract: Drug dosage forms contain many components in addition to the active 
pharmaceutical ingredient(s) to assist in the manufacturing process as well as to optimise 
drug delivery. Due to advances in drug de livery technology, excipients are currently 
included in novel dosage forms to fulfil specific functions and in some cases they directly 
or indirectly influence the extent and/or rate of drug release and absorption. Since plant 
polysaccharides comply with many requirements expected of pharmaceutical excipients such as non-toxicity, stability, availability and renewability they are extensively investigated for use in the development of  solid oral dosage forms. Furthermore, 
polysaccharides with varying physicochemical pr operties can be extracted from plants at 
relatively low cost and can be chemically modi fied to suit specific needs. As an example, 
many polysaccharide-rich plant materials are successfully used as matrix formers in 
modified release dosage forms. Some na tural polysaccharides have even shown 
environmental-responsive gelation characteristic s with the potential to control drug release 
according to specific therapeutic needs. This re view discusses some of the most important 
plant-derived polymeric compounds that are used  or investigated as excipients in drug 
delivery systems.

1. Introduction  
Polymers have been successfully employed in the formulation of solid, liquid and semi-solid dosage 
forms and are specifically useful in the design of  modified release drug delivery systems. Both 
synthetic and natural polymers have been investigated  extensively for this purpose [1,2], but the use of 
natural polymers for pharmaceutical applications is  attractive because they are economical, readily 
available, non-toxic, capable of chemical modi fications, potentially biodegradable and with few 
exceptions, also biocompatible [3-6]. Of increasing importance is the fact that plant resources are 
renewable and if cultivated or harvested in a sustai nable manner, they can provide a constant supply of 
raw material [7]. However, substances from plant origin also pose several potential challenges such as 
being synthesised in small quantities and in mixtures  that are structurally complex, which may differ 
according to the location of the plants as well as ot her variables such as the season. This may result in 
a slow and expensive isolation and purification pro cess. Another issue that has become increasingly 
important is that of intellectual property rights [8,9]. 
Traditionally, excipients were included in drug form ulations as inert vehicles that provided the 
necessary weight, consistency and volume for the corr ect administration of the active ingredient, but in 
modern pharmaceutical dosage forms they often fulf il multi-functional roles such as improvement of 
the stability, release and bioavailability of the activ e ingredient, enhancement of patient acceptability 
and performance of technological functions  that ensure ease of manufacture [10]. 
The specific application of plant-derived polymers in pharmaceutical formulations include their use 
in the manufacture of solid monolithic matrix systems, implants, films, beads, microparticles, 
nanoparticles, inhalable and injectable systems as well as viscous liquid formulations [11,12,13].  
Within these dosage forms, polymeric materials have  fulfilled different roles such as binders, matrix 
formers or drug release modifiers, film coating former s, thickeners or viscosity enhancers, stabilisers, 
disintegrants, solubilisers, emulsifiers, suspendi ng agents, gelling agents and bioadhesives [1].   
Polymers are often utilised in the design of novel drug delivery systems such as those that target 
delivery of the drug to a specific region in the gastrointe stinal tract or in response to external stimuli to 
release the drug. This can be done via different mech anisms including coating of tablets with polymers 
having pH dependent solubilities or incorporati ng non-digestible polymers that are degraded by 
bacterial enzymes in the colon. Non-starch, linear polysaccharides are resistant to the digestive action of the gastrointestinal enzymes and retain their in tegrity in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Matrices 
manufactured from these polysaccharides therefore remain intact in the stomach and the small 
intestine, but once they reach the colon they ar e degraded by the bacterial polysaccharidases. This 
property makes these polysaccharides exceptionally suita ble for the formulation of colon-targeted drug 
delivery systems [4,14].   
This review discusses the use of plant-derived polymers and their semi-synthetic derivatives as 
excipients in the formulation of drug delivery systems.   Specific reference is made to the use of natural 
polymers in the design of novel dosage forms such as modified release matrix type tablets and other new drug delivery systems under investigation.

2. Cellulose 
The polysaccharides of the plant cell wall consist mainly of cellulose, hemicelluloses and pectin 
[15]. Cellulose is an essential structural component  of cell walls in higher plants and is the most 
abundant organic polymer on earth. This lin ear, unbranched polysaccharide consists of β-1,4-linked D-
glucose units and many parallel cellulose molecules fo rm crystalline microfibrils that are mechanically 
strong and highly resistant to enzymatic attack. Th ese long crystalline ribbons are aligned with each 
other to provide structure to the cell wall. Cellulose is insoluble in water and indigestible by the human 
body [16,17].   
Powdered cellulose (whose chemical structure is s hown in Figure 1) is mechanically disintegrated 
cellulose obtained as a pulp from fibrous materials such as wood or cotton and although it was used in 
pharmaceutical applications such as a filler in tablets,  it is microcrystalline cellulose that represents a 
novel and more useful cellulose powder. Microcry stalline cellulose is partially depolymerised 
cellulose prepared by treating high quality cellulose  with hydrochloric acid to produce free flowing 
non-fibrous particles. Microcrystalline cellulose is  mainly used in the pharmaceutical industry as a 
diluent/binder in tablets for both the granulation and direct compression processes [18,19].   
The hydroxyl moieties on the D-glucopyranose units of the cellulo se polymer offer a variety of 
possibilities for the formation of derivatives. Ce llulose derivatives can be made by means of 
etherification (e.g. hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, carboxym ethylcellulose), esterification (cellulose 
nitrate, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate phthalate ), cross-linking or graft copolymerisation [18].  
Controlled release applications for cellulose de rivatives include the formulation of membrane 
controlled drug release systems or monolithic matr ix systems. Film coating techniques for the 
manufacture of membrane controlled release systems include enteric coated dosage forms and the use 
of semi-permeable membranes in osmotic pump delivery systems. Cellulose acetate was amongst the first materials used to prepare semi-permeab le membranes for osmotic pump dosage forms and 
cellulose esters as well as cellulose ester blends are continually used commercially for this purpose [20]. However, monolithic matrix systems are am ongst the most popular technologies for controlled 
drug delivery because of their simplicity of formul ation, ease of manufacture, low cost, acceptance and 
applicability to drugs with a wide range of solubility [21,22].   
Cellulose ethers are prepared by replacing the hydroxyl groups with either alkyl or hydroxylalkyl 
groups [18]. Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (chemical st ructure is shown in Figure 1) is a partly O-
methylated and O-(2-hydroxypropylated) cellulose ether derivative that has been extensively 
investigated as an excipient in controlled releas e drug delivery systems due to its gel forming ability 
[1,23]. In a study where two cellulose ethe rs; hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and carboxymethyl-
cellulose were employed as polymeric carrier materi als in matrix tablets for controlled release of a 
soluble drug, diltiazem, it was found that each polymer  on its own could sustain drug release over an 
extended period of time in these systems. More impor tantly, a mixture of the two cellulose ethers in 
the matrix type tablets enabled zero order dr ug release kinetics at both pH 4.5 and 6.8 [24].  
Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose monolithic matrix syst ems showed similar dissolution profiles as a 
commercial osmotic pump system for glipizide, a drug with low solubility. It was further found that the hydroxypropylmethylcellulose matrix systems have a stronger gel structure than those made of Molecules 2009, 14

polyethylene oxide, which may provide superior in vivo  performance in terms of matrix resistance to 
the destructive forces within the gastrointestinal tract [22].

3. Hemicellulose 
Hemicellulose consists of a group of complex polysaccharides that are bound to the surface of 
cellulose microfibrils but their structure prevents  them from forming microfibrils by themselves.  
Hemicellulose polysaccharides consist of xyloglucans,  xylans and mannans that can be extracted from 
the plant cell wall with a strong alka li. They have backbones made up of β-1,4-linked D-glycans. 
Xyloglucan has a similar backbone as cellulose, but contains xylose branches on 3 out of every 4 
glucose monomers. The β-1,4-linked D-xylan backbone of arabinoxylan contains arabinose branches 
[16,17,25,26].   
Glucomannan is a hydrocolloidal polysacchar ide of the mannan family consisting of β-1,4 linked  
D-mannose and D-glucose monomers (with acetyl side branch es on some of the backbone units), but 
the mannose:glucose ratio may differ depending on the source. The acetyl groups contribute to its solubility and swelling capacity and assist in ma king it a soluble natural polysaccharide with the 
highest viscosity and water-holding capacity. It is very abundant in Nature and this polysaccharide is specifically derived from softwoods, roots, tubers and plant bulbs. The most commonly used type of 
glucomannan is referred to as konjac glucomanna n, which is extracted from the tubers of 
Amorphophallus konjac  K. Koch and is a very promising pol ysaccharide for incorporation into drug 
delivery systems. Since konjac glucomannan by itself forms very weak gels, it has been investigated as an effective excipient in controlled release drug de livery devices in combination with other polymers 
or by modifying its chemical structure [13,27].   
It was shown that konjac glucomannan gel systems we re able to maintain integrity and control the 
release of theophylline and diltiazem for 8 hours. Th is was, however, dependent on the country of Molecules 2009, 14                            
 
 2606
origin (i.e. Japan, Europe or America) due to di fferences in the degree of acetylation of the konjac 
glucomannan [27]. Matrix tablets prepared from  konjac glucomannan alone showed the ability to 
sustain the release of cimetidine in the physiological environments of the stomach and small intestines 
but the presence of β-mannanase (colon) accelerated the drug release substantially. Mixtures of konjac 
glucomannan and xanthan gum in matrix type tablet s showed high potential to sustain and control the 
release of the drug due to stabilisation of the gel pha se of the tablets by a network of intermolecular 
hydrogen bonds between the two polymers to e ffectively retard drug diffusion [28]. Wen et al., 2008 
[29] used konjac glucomannan to form hydrophilic cy linders and particles for controlled release of 
DNA. Konjac glucomannan cross-linked with tris odium trimetaphosphate formed hydrogel systems 
that could sustain hydrocortisone release dependent on cross-linking density and enzymatic 
degradation [30]. 
4. Pectin 
Pectin (chemical structure is shown in Figure 2) is a family of complex polysaccharides present in 
the walls that surround growing and dividing plant ce lls. It is also present in the junctional zone 
between cells within secondary cell walls includi ng xylem and fiber cells in woody tissue [31,32].  
Pectin is an essential component in the initial growth  and ripening process of fruit and is often a waste 
material from the food and fruit processing industry with a consequent high availability [33]. The main 
component of pectin is a linear polysaccharide composed of α-1,4-linked D-galacturonic acid units, but 
the linear structure is interrupted with highly bran ched regions. The galacturonic acid polysaccharides 
are rich in neutral sugars such as rhamnose, arab inose, galactose, xylose and glucose. The composition 
of pectin can vary based on the botanical source, fo r example pectin from citrus contains less neutral 
sugars and has a smaller molecular size compared to pectin obtained from apples [34-36].   
Pectin has been investigated as an excipient in many different types of dosage forms such as film 
coating of colon-specific drug delivery systems wh en mixed with ethyl cellulose, microparticulate 
delivery systems for ophthalmic preparations and matr ix type transdermal patches. It has high potential 
as a hydrophilic polymeric material for controlled release matrix drug delivery systems, but its 
aqueous solubility contributes to premature and fast release of the drug from these matrices [14].   
One of the options to reduce the high solubility of  pectin in aqueous medium is through chemical 
modification without affecting favourable biodegrad ability properties. Pectins can be chemically 
modified by saponification catalysed by mineral aci ds, bases, salts of weak acids, enzymes, 
concentrated ammonium systems and primary aliphatic  amines. Calcium salts of pectin have reduced 
solubility and matrix tablets prepared with calcium pectinate showed very good potential to be used in 
colon-targeted drug delivery systems. Furthermore, cross-linking of pectin with calcium ions inhibits 
the release of the incorporated drug from pec tin tablets by suppressing both the dissolution and 
swelling of these systems [33,37-39].   
Depending on the type and structure of the pectin  molecule, pectins can gel in various ways. 
Gelling can be induced by acid or cross-linking with calcium ion or by reaction with alginate. When a 
pectin solution is titrated with acid, the ioniza tion of carboxylate groups on pectins is repressed 
causing pectin molecules to no longer repel each othe r over their entire chains. The pectins can thus 
associate over a portion of their chains to form acid-pectin gels. Gel forming systems have been Molecules 2009, 14                            
 
 2607
investigated widely for sustained drug delivery. A mixture of xyloglucan with pectin resulted in an in 
situ gel forming system with sustained paracetamol drug delivery in rats [38,40].   
Figure 2. Chemical structure of pectin. 
 
5. Inulin 
Inulin (chemical structure is shown in Figure 3) consists of a mixture of oligomers and polymers 
that belong to the group of gluco- fructans and occur in plants such as garlic, onion, artichoke and 
chicory. The inulin molecules contain from two to more than 60 fructose molecules linked by β-2,1-
bonds. Inulin is resistant to digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract, but is degraded by colonic 
microflora [41,42].   
Inulin with a high degree of polymerisation was used  to prepare biodegradable colon-specific films 
in combination with Eudragit® RS that could withstand break down by the gastric and intestinal fluids 
[41]. It was shown in anothe r study where different Eudragits® were formulated into films with inulin 
that when a combination of Eudragit® RS and Eudragit® RL was mixed with inulin it exhibited better 
swelling and permeation properties in colonic medium rather than other gastrointestinal media [43]. 
Methylated inulin hydrogels were developed as co lon-specific drug delivery systems and investigated 
for water uptake and swelling. The hydrogels exhib ited a relatively high rate of water uptake and 
anomalous dynamic swelling behaviour [42].   
Inulin derivatised with methacrylic anhydrid e and succinic anhydride produced a pH sensitive 
hydrogel by UV irradiation that exhibited a reduced swelling and low chemical degradation in acidic 
medium, but it had a good swelling and degradation in simulated intestinal fluid in the presence of its 
specific enzyme, inulinase [44].

6. Alginates 
Alginates or alginic acids (chemical structur e is shown in Figure 4) are linear, unbranched 
polysaccharides found in brown seaweed and marine algae such as Laminaria hyperborea , 
Ascophyllum nodosum  and Macrocystis pyrifera . These polymers consist of two different monomers in 
varying proportions, namely β -D-mannuronic acid and α-L-guluronic acid linked in α- or β-1,4 
glycosidic bonds as blocks of only β -D-mannuronic acid or α-L-guluronic acid in homopolymers or 
alternating the two in heteropolymeric blocks. Al ginates have high molecular weights of 20 to 600 
kDa [16,45,46].   
Alginates have been used and investigated as stabilizers in emulsions, suspending agents, tablet 
binders and tablet disintegrants [47]. The gelling properties of alginate’s guluronic residues with 
polyvalent ions such as calcium or aluminium allo w cross-linking with subsequent formation of gels 
that can be employed to prepare matrices, films,  beads, pellets, microparticles and nanoparticles 
[48,49] . Dual drug-loaded alginate beads containing dr ug in inner and outer layers were prepared by 
dropping single-layered alginate beads into a CaCl 2 solution and their drug release characteristics were 
investigated in simulated gastric fluid followed by intestinal fluid. The beads protected the drug in the 
gastric fluid with no release of the drug, while a bipha sic release (i.e. a linear release for the first four 
hours and another linear phase thereafter) was obtaine d when the dissolution medium was changed to 
intestinal fluid [50].   
The in vivo  delivery of anti-tuberculosis drugs was inve stigated in mice for alginate nanoparticles 
prepared by cation induced gelation. A single oral dose achieved therapeutic drug concentrations in the blood plasma for 7-11 days and in organs such as th e lungs, liver and spleen fo r a total of 15 days. The 
drugs encapsulated into these nanoparticles resulted in significantly higher bioavailability compared to 
the free drug. Furthermore, in M. tuberculosis  infected mice only three oral doses of the nanoparticles 
that were spaced 15 days apart resulted in complete  bacterial clearance from specific organs, which is 
comparable to 45 conventional doses of the free drug [51]. 
In a study where different grades of sodium alginate with different particle size distributions, 
viscosities and chemical compositions were used as drug release modifiers, it was found that the 
mentioned variables influence swelling, erosion and dr ug release from matrix type tablets, especially 
in a neutral environment.  It was shown that sodium  alginate matrix type tablets are able to sustain 
drug release even for highly soluble drug candidates.  Furthermore, the drug release data obtained in a 
neutral dissolution medium correlated well with a zero-order kinetics model [35,45].

7. Carrageenans 
Carrageenans is the generic name for a family of  high molecular weight sulphated polysaccharides 
obtained from certain species of red seaweed s belonging to the class Rhodophyceae, especially 
Chondrus crispus , Euchema spp, Gigartina stellata and Iridaea spp [52,53]. Carrageenan extracted Molecules 2009, 14                            
 
 2609
from seaweed is not assimilated by the human body and provides only bulk but no nutrition. There are 
three basic types of carrageenan (chemical structures are shown in Figure 5): kappa ( κ), iota (ι ) and 
lambda (λ ) [16]. The λ-type carrageenan results in viscous solutions but is non-gelling, while the κ -
type carrageenan forms a brittle gel. The ι-type carrageenan produces elastic gels [47,52]. 
A study where the compaction ability of two κ-carrageenans (Gelcarin® GP-812 NF and GP-911 
NF) and one ι-carrageenan (Gelcarin® GP-379 NF) was investigated showed that these carrageenans 
are able to form strong compacts with a high elastic recovery. It was finally concluded from the results 
that the carrageenans investigated were suitabl e tableting excipients for the manufacturing of 
controlled-release tablets [54]. In  another study, matrices made of ι-carrageenan and λ-carrageenan 
sustained the release of three different model drugs and showed release profiles that approached zero-
order kinetics. It was found that f actors such as tablet diameter, drug to carrageenan ratio and ionic 
strength of the dissolution medium may play a role in the release of drug from these matrices [55]. 
Hydrogel beads were prepared from a mixture of cross-linked κ -carrageenan with potassium and 
cross-linked alginate with calcium and they exhibited a smoother surface morphology than that of the 
one-polysaccharide network beads. The carrageenan  parts of the hydrogel pronouncedly enhanced the 
thermostability of the polymeric network. These bead s were introduced as novel carriers for controlled 
drug delivery systems [56].

8. Rosin 
Rosin (chemical structure is shown in Figure 6) is a natural polymer with a low molecular weight of 
400 Da obtained from the oleoresin of pine  trees, with the principle sources being Pinus soxburghui, 
Pinus longifolium and Pinus toeda. Rosin is primarily composed of abietic and pimaric acids and has 
excellent film-forming properties. Rosin and its derivatives are biopolymers that are increasingly used for their pharmaceutical applications. In the pharm aceutical context it has been investigated for 
microencapsulation, film-forming and coating properties,  matrix materials in tablets for sustained and 
controlled release [3,57,58]. Molecules 2009, 14

Derivatives of rosin synthesized by a reaction w ith polyethylene glycol 200 and maleic anhydride 
proofed suitable for sustaining drug release from ma trix tablets and pellets [59]. Polymerised rosin 
films containing hydrophobic plasticisers showed exce llent potential as coating materials for the 
preparation of sustained release dosage forms [60]. Different studies on the film forming and coating 
properties of rosin and the glycerol ester of maleic  rosin demonstrated their potential to be used as 
coating materials for pharmaceutical products as well as in sustained-release drug delivery systems.  
Furthermore, rosin films showed biodegradation and biocompatibility similar to that of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) [3,61]. It was shown that hydrocortisone  loaded nanoparticles prepared from rosin could 
slowly release this model drug, which wa s dependent on the rosin content. This in vitro  study 
demonstrated the potential of rosin for the pr oduction of effective nanoparticulate drug delivery 
systems [62].

9. Gums and mucilages 
The term ‘gum’ as applied to water-soluble substances refers to natural non-starch polysaccharides 
and their structurally modified derivatives. Mucilage s is a term that was used to describe the slimy 
aqueous dispersions produced by plants, animals a nd microbes, which consist basically of water-
soluble polysaccharides including starches and modifi ed starches [63]. Gums and mucilages are used 
in many pharmaceutical applications such as emulsify ers, suspending agents, binders and disintegrants 
as well as sustaining agents in tablets and as gelling agents [64]. 
9.1. Guar gum 
Guar gum (chemical structure is shown in Figure 7) is also called guaran, clusterbean, Calcutta 
lucern, Gum cyamposis, Cyamopsis gum, Guarina, Glucotard and Guyarem [65]. Guar gum is a 
galactomannan, which occurs as a storage polysacchar ide in the seed endosperm of plants in the 
Fabaceae family. Galactomannans are lin ear polysaccharides consisting of (1 →4)-diequatorially 
linked β-D-mannose monomers, some of which are linked to single sugar side-chains of α-D-galactose 
attached [66]. Guar gum has a backbone composed of β-1,4 linked- D-mannopyranoses to which, on 
average, every alternate mannose an α-D-galactose is linked 1 Æ6 [53]. The FDA has affirmed guar 
gum as generally safe [47].   
Guar gum has recently been highlighted as an in expensive and flexible carrier for oral extended 
release drug delivery [2]. Guar gum is particularly useful for colon delivery because it can be degraded Molecules 2009, 14                            
 
 2611
by specific enzymes in this region of the gastrointe stinal tract. The gum protects the drug while in the 
stomach and small intestine environment and delivers the drug to the colon where it undergoes 
assimilation by specific microorganisms or de gradation by the enzymes excreted by these 
microorganisms. As a hydrogel, guar gum was not found to be highly suitable for controlled release of 
water-soluble drugs because of their relatively fast  delivery, but is useful for poorly water-soluble 
drugs. It is also used as thickener for lotions and creams, as a tablet binder and as an emulsion 
stabilizer [47,53]. Guar gum on its own showed high pot ential to serve as a carrier for oral controlled 
release matrix systems. In addition, it was found that in clusion of excipients can be used as a tool to 
modulate drug release from these matrix systems [67]. 
Figure 7. Chemical structure of guar gum. 
 
9.2. Locust bean gum 
Locust bean gum (chemical structure is shown in Figure 8) also known as Carob bean gum is 
derived from the seeds of the leguminous plant Ceratonia siliqua Linn. This gum is widely cultivated 
in the Mediterranean region and to a smaller extent also in California. The brown pods or beans of the 
locust bean tree are processed by milling the endosperms to form locust bean gum and it is therefore not an extract of the native plant but a flour. Lo cust bean gum consists mainly of a neutral 
galactomannan polymer made up of 1,4-linked 
D-mannopyranosyl units and ever y fourth or fifth chain 
unit is substituted on C6 with a D-galactopyranosyl unit. The ratio of D-galactose to D-manose differs 
and this is believed to be due to the varying origin s of the gum materials and growth conditions of the 
plant during production. Locust bean gum is a neut ral polymer and its viscosity and solubility are 
therefore little affected by pH changes within the range of 3-11 [68].   
Locust bean gum was used to produce matrix tablets with and without the cross-linker, 
glutaraldehyde, that showed similar drug release profiles for different model drugs as guar gum and scleroglucan [53]. In another study, sustained releas e of diclofenac sodium could be obtained for mini-
matrix systems made from locust bean gum [69] . A commercially available tablet system (TIMERx
®) 
developed by Penwest Pharmaceuticals Company cons isting of locust bean gum and xanthan gum 
showed both in vitro and in vivo  controlled release potential [70].

9.3. Gum arabic  
Gum arabic is a natural polysaccharide wh ich is obtained from the exudates of Acacia  trees [71].  
Structurally, gum arabic is a branched molecu le with the main chain consisting of 1,3-linked β-D 
galactopyranosyl units with other carbohydrates such as arabinose, glucuronic acid and rhamnose also 
present. Gum arabic was successfully used as a matrix microencapsulating agent for the enzyme, 
endoglucanase, which proofed to give slow rel ease of the encapsulated enzyme and in addition 
increased its stability [72]. Gum arabic was used as an osmotic suspending and expanding agent to 
prepare a monolithic osmotic tablet system. The optimum system delivered the water-insoluble drug, 
naproxen, at a rate of approximately zero order for up to 12 hours at a pH of 6.8 [73]. 
9.4. Psyllium 
Psyllium mucilage is obtained from the seed coat of Plantago ovata  by milling the outer layer of 
the seeds. It has been evaluated for its tablet binding properties [74], but also to form hydrogels 
through radiation-induced cross-linking for controlle d release of 5-fluorouracil as model drug [75]. 
Psyllium and methacrylamide based hydrogels were prepared by using N ,N’-methylenebisacrylamide 
as cross-linker, which were then loaded with in sulin. These cross-linked hydrogels showed controlled 
release of the active ingredient by means of non- Fickian diffusion of the drug through polymer chain 
relaxation during swelling [76]. Psyllium husk was used in combination with other excipients such as 
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose to prepare novel sust ained release, swellable and bioadhesive 
gastroretentive drug delivery systems for ofloxacin [77].   9.5. Starch 
Starch is a storage carbohydrate consisting of gluc ose monomers in plants such as cereals, root 
vegetables and legumes. It is comprised of two pol ymers (chemical structures are shown in Figure 9), 
namely amylose (a non-branching helical polymer consisting of α-1,4 linked 
D-glucose monomers) 
and amylopectin (a highly branch ed polymer consisting of both α-1,4 and α-1,6 linked D-glucose 
monomers). Most common cereal starches contain 15-30%  amylose, but discovery of a recessive gene 
responsible for production of starch enriched with amylose led to the use of a genetically modified 
crop for the production of different starches for speci fic purposes. This has led to the creation of corn 
producing high amylose starch with a content of 50% , 70% and even up to 90% amylose. Distinct X-
ray diffraction patterns are obtained from the crystallin e form of starch in granules to distinguish 
between different types. Type A crystalline structure is characteristic of cereals such as rice wheat and Molecules 2009, 14

maize, which is favoured by amylopectin with short lateral chains and branching points close to each 
other. Type B is typical of starch from potato and banana and is favoured by long side chains as well 
as distant branching points. Type C is found in legumes and is a mixture of the A- and B-type 
crystalline structures. Starch can also adopt a V-t ype crystalline structure (derived from the German 
word ‘Verkleisterung’ meaning ‘gelatinised starch’), which is common for modified starch but is also 
observed in the endosperm of some native starch granules [78,79].   
Pregelatinised starch is modified starch by ch emical and/or mechanical means to rupture its 
granules, which results in starch with enhanced flow properties that is direct compressible. Partially pregelatinised grades are commercially available where pregelatinised starch is mixed with free 
amylase, free amylopectin and unmodified starch  in specified ratios. Pharmaceutical grade 
pregelatinised starch does not contain chemical additiv es (e.g. salts or bases as gelatinised aids) and is 
produced by heating and subsequent  drying [19]. Starch retrograda tion refers to aggregation and 
crystallisation of starch chains (or precipitation) in gels to form a rigid tri-dimensional network with 
increased stiffness of the sample [79]. 
Native starch may not be suitable in controlled release drug delivery systems due to substantial 
swelling and rapid enzymatic degradation resulting in too fast release of many drugs. This has led to 
the use of derivatives of starch that are more re sistant to enzymatic degradation as well as cross-
linking and formation of co-polymers. Starch acet ate prepared by acetyl esterification has shown 
retarded enzymatic degradation with the potential to be used as a colon-targeted drug delivery carrier 
[80].  Cross-linked high amylose starches have been  developed as suitable excipients for controlled 
release solid oral dosage forms with high loadi ng capacities of active ingredient and with the 
capability of achieving quasi-zero order release for mo st drugs. Other advantages include absence of 
erosion, limited swelling and the ability to control th e rate of drug release by changing the degree of 
cross-linking [81].  A starch produc t obtained by enzymatic degradation of gelatinised potato starch 
followed by retrogradation, filtration and washing with ethanol was found to be suitable for the 
manufacturing of directly compressible controlle d release matrix systems [82]. High amylose 
carboxymethyl starch produced by spray drying show ed high loading capacity for the soluble drug, 
acetaminophen, in controlled release direct compressible matrix systems [83].

Amylose has the ability to form films and when mixed with ethyl cellulose (Ethocel®), the films are 
degradable by colonic bacteria but resistant to gastric acid and pancreatic enzymes upon additional 
thermal treatment. Amylose and Ethocel® in the ratio of 1:4 w/w showed optimum drug release 
retarding properties in gastric and intestinal flui ds. Another potential coating for colonic drug delivery 
that has been evaluated is organic solvent base d amylose-ethylcellulose films. These films were 
susceptible to digestion by bacterial enzymes in a simulated colonic environment as reviewed by Sinha 
and Kumria in 2001 [37].   
9.6. Aloe gel 
The inner part of the leaves of Aloe vera  (L.) Burm.f. (Aloe barbadensis  Miller) consists of the 
parenchyma tissue that contains the mucila ginous gel [84]. After extraction of the A. vera  gel from the 
leaves and a filtration step, the acetone precipitate was directly compressed in matrix systems with 
diclofenac sodium as model drug. The mucilage pr oduced direct compressible matrix tablets that 
showed good swelling and sustained release of the model drug [85]. 
9. Conclusions 
Although excipients have traditionally been included in  formulations as inert substances to mainly 
make up volume and assist in the manufacturing pr ocess, they are increasingly included in dosage 
forms to fulfil specialised functions for impr oved drug delivery because many new drugs have 
unfavourable physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. Several polymers from plant origin 
have been successfully used and others are being investigated as excipients in the design of dosage forms for effective drug delivery. Some polysaccharid es obtained from plants such as carrageenan, 
alginate, konjac glucomannan, gum arabic, guar gum and locust bean gum have shown excellent 
potential as carrier materials in matrix type controlled release dosage forms such as microparticles, beads, tablets and cross-linked hydrogels. Plant polysaccharides such as pectin, inulin and rosin have been investigated for their film forming properties, while others have been chemically or physically modified such as the formation of cellulose and starch derivatives. These semi-synthetic polymers are 
extensively used in the formulation of conventi onal dosage forms and are under investigation for use Molecules 2009, 14

in novel drug delivery systems. Plants provide an attractive and renewable source not only for active 
pharmaceutical ingredients but also for materials that  can be utilised as excipients in pharmaceutical 
products for the effective delivery of drugs.
