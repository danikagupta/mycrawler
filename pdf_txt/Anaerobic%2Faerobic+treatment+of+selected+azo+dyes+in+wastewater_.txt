Re: Request for Scheduling of a Technical Presentation on .Capping and
Solidification/Stabilization at the USEPA Region HI Office,
Tuesday, December 13, 1994
Dear Garth:
Parsons Engineering Science, Inc. (Parsons ES) is interested in providing a technical
presentation on the use of containment remedies [i.e. capping and solidification/stabilization (S/S)
technologies] at Superfund sites. I believe that this presentation will be an extremely valuable tool
for yourself and other Region III technical staff involved with site remediation activities.
As part of the presentation, Parsons ES has invited two independent experts in the field of
capping and S/S to share their knowledge with the group. Dr. David Daniel, University of Texas,
is an expert in capping issues. Dr. Daniel has made presentations to all ten USEPA regional
offices on the use of capping at hazardous waste sites. Dr. Paul Bishop, University of Cincinnati,
is an expert on S/S, has been a technical reviewer of USEPA published reports on S/S of
Comprehensive Environmental Restoration, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) waste, and has recently co-authorized a book
on innovative site remediation technologies using S/S. Biographies of both experts are included as
Attachment 1.
As you are aware, the scheduling of these two experts to attend and make presentations at
the same time was a difficult task. To successfully initiate this process, I am requesting an
appointment to present this technology information for Tuesday, December 13, 1994, from 9:00
to approximately 11:30 a.m. in the USEPA Region m offices. I have attached a draft agenda
(Attachment 2) of the proposed presentation. The presentation will be entirely technical in nature
and will be completely generic. The intent of the presentation is to give you and other USEPA
staff an opportunity to learn of some of the new innovations in the field of cover systems and S/S
technologies. Site specific remedy selection will not be a part of this presentation.

I believe that the technical presentation will provide an excellent forum for learning and
discussing these types of technology applications. A good portion of our discussion will relate to
the use of these technologies and how they achieve protection of human health and the
environment. Thus, we would encourage USEPA risk assessment and BTAG staff to attend.
Please review the enclosed materials and contact me at (804) 460-4453 with your questions and
concerns. We will need to finalize the date and time as soon as possible.
Sincerely,
PARSONS ENGINEERING-SCIENCE, INC.
