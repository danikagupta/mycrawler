PREFACE  
 
 
This Ph.D. thesis structure results from different papers published and/or submitted 
for publication in international journals, during the work carried out mainly at CQVR (Centro de Química de Vila Real) in the Ch emistry Department, School of Life Sciences 
and Environment, University of Trás-os-Mo ntes and Alto Douro (UTAD), throughout the 
period between May 2006 and September 2009. 
The main goal of this dissertation was trying to understand th e application of 
several Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs)  and determine the main operational factors 
that control the decomposition of the organi c content present in textile and winery 
wastewaters. These types of wastewaters were selected as the study ta rget objects for two 
main reasons: first, because they are an im portant environmental problem in the North of 
Portugal. The textile industry biggest factor ies can be found spreading throughout Porto 
and Braga districts, especially in the Av e hydrographic basin. Second, since we would like 
work with a synthetic wastewater (textile e ffluents) and a wastew ater generated by an 
agricultural process characterised by the pr esence of natural organic matter (winery 
effluents). Therefore, in the experiments where there were simulated textile wastewater 
was used a model compound, a synthetic azo dye named Reactive Black 5 (RB5). Winery wastewater experiments were performed with authentic effluent provided by some local 
cellars and at other times by the di lution of wine and grape juice. 
To achieve this knowledge can be a rema rkable contribution in increasing the 
efficiency of AOPs treatment processes when a pplied to textile and winery wastewaters, as 
well as to acquire a more deta iled understanding of the main  advantages and drawbacks of 
each technology. 
The dissertation is orga nized in 9 chapters. Chapter 1  considers a general 
introduction and review of the state-of-the -art focused in the textile and winery 
wastewaters, and also in the treatment technol ogies that will be tested in this thesis - 
advanced oxidation processes (Fenton’s r eagent, photo-Fenton, photo-ferrioxalate, 
heterogeneous photocatalysis (TiO
2), ozone, ozone/UV and ozone/UV/H 2O2) to the above 
mentioned wastewaters. 
In chapter 2  starts the study related to textile wa stewaters. It is shown the treatment 
of a model textile compound, the azo dye Reactive Black 5, with Fenton/UV-C and Preface 
 
 
ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light processes. Here the main objective was analysing the 
feasibility of decolourization and mineralization of RB5 by the cited AOPs. The influences 
of different operational parameters (source a nd intensity of light, pH, hydrogen peroxide, 
ferrous iron and RB5 concentration) and th e reaction kinetics of each process is also 
studied. An important issue to take into acco unt within this study is to evaluate the 
treatment capacity of the ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light process once the utilization of solar 
light as a UV source clearly reduces the en vironmental and economical impact of the 
treatment process. 
The combination of an AOP with an aer obic biological pro cess is studied in 
chapter 3 . In this study the Fenton’s reagent cap acity to treat high concentrated RB5 
solutions by itself is first tested and then selected the optimal ferrous iron and hydrogen 
peroxide dosages. Afterwards the treatment capacity of the Candida oleophila  yeast with 
the same RB5 concentrations studied in th e Fenton’s reagent expe riments is evaluated. 
Finally, the experimental work regarding the textile wastewater is concluded through the 
combination of Fenton’s reagent and Candida oleophila . As additional information it is 
important highlight that the application of the Candida oleophila yeast to wastewaters with 
high phenolic content is protecte d by a Portuguese national pate nt (Lucas M.S., Peres J.A., 
Amaral C., Sampaio A., Dias A.A. Processo bi ológico aeróbio de tratamento de efluentes 
agro-industriais com elevado teor em compos tos aromáticos baseado na aplicação de 
microrganismos da espécie Candida oleophila . Portuguese Patent nº 103 738 assigned at 
13th August 2009.  
In chapter 4 , starts the application of advanced oxidation processes to the treatment 
of winery wastewaters. In this chapter th e performance of several AOPs is evaluated, 
specifically the Fenton’s reag ent, ferrioxalate and heterogeneous photocatalysis (TiO 2) 
processes combined with different UV radiati on sources, in the degradation of one of the 
most representative phenolic compounds present in the winery wastewaters: the gallic acid. 
From this AOPs screening we tried to select the optimal process to further application to 
winery wastewaters. A toxicological assessm ent will be carried out with the marine 
bacteria Vibrio fischeri  to evaluate the influence of each  AOP studied in the gallic acid 
detoxification. 
Chapter 5  presents the work done during a research stay performed in the 
Plataforma Solar de Almería (Spain) during th e Ph.D. scholarship. Despite in chapter 4 the 
AOP selected as best treatment option wa s photo-Fenton with the UV TNN 15/32 lamp, an Preface 
 
 
attempt was made to test the application of the photo-Fenton proces s but using solar light 
as UV radiation source in a Compound Parabo lic Collector (CPC) pi lot-solar plant to 
winery wastewaters treatment. This study wa s done trying to meet the optimal conditions 
in the use of solar light in the wastewater treatment once it is applied in a CPC reactor. 
This work makes possible to evaluate the pe rformance of solar photochemical AOPs, such 
as heterogeneous phot ocatalysis (with TiO 2, TiO 2/H2O2 and TiO 2/S2O82-) and 
homogeneous photocatalys is like photo-Fenton. 
Chapters 6 and 7 are addressed to the use of ozone and ozone-related processes to 
the treatment of winery wastewaters. This wo rk was carried during a research stay at the 
Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, University of Nottingham, United Kingdom. In chapter 6  the kinetics of ozonation of wine ry wastewater is studied in 
detail in a pilot-scale, semi-batch bubble column reactor. The performance of both 
processes was compared, as well as the eff ect of the most releva nt operating conditions. 
The study investigates the relationship between pH, ORP,  COD, UV absorbance (254 nm), 
total polyphenol content and ozone consumpti on as a function of time and the prevalent 
kinetic conditions (fast, intermediate and sl ow kinetic regime) for the reaction of ozone 
with the dissolved organic species. Furtherm ore, a kinetic ozonation model is presented 
and used to estimate the kinetic coefficients  of the ozonation of winery wastewater under 
the prevailing experimental conditions. In chapter 7  the effectiveness of different ozone-
based AOP (O
3, O 3/UV and O 3/UV/H 2O2) on the treatment of winery wastewater, in a 
pilot-plant scale reactor is researched. The effect of initial pH, organic load of winery wastewater and hydrogen peroxide concentrati on is investigated in the same pilot scale 
reactor. 
Chapter 8  presents a combined treatment: long  term aerated storage and Fenton’s 
reagent, to winery wastewaters. The main goa l is to evaluate the capacity of treating 
winery wastewater in a long term biologic aera ted storage, with different aeration schemes, 
combined with Fenton’s reagent. This chemical oxidation process, that uses low-priced reactants, was used as a s econdary chemical treatment st ep for the oxidation of the 
recalcitrant organic compounds  or metabolites that could not be oxidized biologically. 
Finally, in chapter 9 , the main conclusions are summarized and future research 
developments are proposed.  ixCONTENTS

 xvABSTRACT  
 
 
This research contributes to the stu dy and development of advanced oxidation 
technologies applied to two different problematic wastew aters: textile and winery 
wastewaters. In this dissertation the factor s that influence the oxidation of the model 
compound of textile wastewaters, the azo dye Reactive Black 5 (RB5),  and of the winery 
wastewaters were investigated.  
The first part of the thesis experimental work is dedicated to the decolorization of 
RB5 solutions. The RB5 dye was selected as model molecule to represent the concerned 
dye group because is widely used in the textile and paper industries, hardly biodegradable and inexpensive. Firstly, an experimental  comparison among two photoxidation systems, 
Fenton/UV-C and ferrioxalate/H
2O2/solar light, was performed. The variables considered 
were pH, H 2O2 dosage, iron dosage, RB5 concentration and source of light. The 
experiments indicate that RB5 can be e ffectively decolorized using Fenton/UV-C and 
ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light processes with a small difference between the two processes, 
98.1 and 93.2%, respectively, after 30 minutes. Although the lesser difference in dye 
decolorization, significant increment in TOC removal was found with Fenton/UV-C 
process (46.4% TOC removal) relative to ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light process (29.6% 
TOC removal). This fact reveals that UV-C low pressure mercury lamp although with its 
small effect on dye decolorization is particul arly important in dye mineralization, when 
compared to solar light. 
Further, it was tested the decoloriza tion of aqueous azo dye RB5 solution 
combining an Advanced Oxidation Process (Fenton’s reagent) followed by an aerobic biological process (mediated by the yeast Candida oleophila ). Fenton’s process alone, as 
well as aerobic treatment by Candida oleophila  alone, exhibited the capacity to 
significantly decolorize azo dye solutions up to 200 mg/L , within about 1 and 24 hours 
respectively. By contrast, neither Fenton’s reagent nor Candida oleophila  sole treatments 
showed acceptable decolorizing abilities for hi gher initial dye concentrations (300 and 500 
mg/L). But the combination between the two pr ocesses, with Fenton’s reagent process as 
primary treatment, at 1.0x10
-3 mol/L H 2O2 and 1.0x10-4 mol/L Fe2+, and growing yeast 
cells as a secondary treatment, achieves a co lor removal of about 91% for an initial RB5 
concentration of 500 mg/L. Abstract 
 
 
 xviIn a second stage, is presented the experimental work done with winery 
wastewaters. This study starts with the eval uation of the capacity of  different Advanced 
Oxidation Processes (AOP) combined with several radiation sour ces to degrade the 
phenolic compound Gallic Acid (GA), the most  representative phenolic compound present 
in the winery wastewaters. From the experi ments conducted it was possible to suggest that 
the AOP, Fe2+ + H 2O2 + UV TNN 15/32 (photo-Fenton pro cess), was the most efficient 
process thereby achieving the GA degradation value of 95.6% in 7.5 minutes and resulting 
in a total elimination of toxicity. 
Afterwards, the degradation of simulated wi nery wastewater was studied in a pilot-
scale Compound Parabolic Collector (CPC) so lar reactor. Total organic carbon (TOC) 
reduction with heterogeneous photocatalysis (TiO 2) and homogeneous photocatalysis with 
photo-Fenton is observed. Heteroge neous photocatalysis with TiO 2, TiO 2/H2O2 and 
TiO 2/S2O82- is revealed to be inefficient in re moving TOC, achieving TOC degradation of 
10%, 11% and 25%, respectively, at best. Ho wever, photo-Fenton experiments achieved 
46% TOC degradation in simula ted wastewater prepared with  diluted wine (WV) and 93% 
in wastewater prepared with diluted grape juice (WG), and if et hanol is previously 
eliminated from mixed wine and grape juice wastewater (WW) by air stripping, it removes 
96% of TOC. 
Ozonation of organic substances present in  winery wastewater was studied in a 
pilot-scale bubble column reactor. A steady reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD) 
was observed under the action of ozone at the natural pH of the wastewater (pH 4). At 
alkaline and neutral pH the degradation rate  was accelerated by the formation of radical 
species from the decomposition of ozone. Th e monitoring of pH, redox potential (ORP), 
UV absorbance (254 nm), polyphenols content an d ozone consumption was correlated with 
the oxidation of the organic species in the wate r. The ozonation of winery wastewater in 
the bubble column was analysed in terms of  a mole balance coupled with ozonation 
kinetics modeled by the two-film theory of mass transfer and chemical reaction. It was 
determined that the ozonation reaction can de velop both in and across different kinetic 
regimes: fast, moderate and slow, depe nding on the experimental conditions.  
Besides ozonation also the effectivene ss of different ozone -based advanced 
oxidation processes (O 3, O 3/UV and O 3/UV/H 2O2) on the treatment of winery wastewater 
was investigated in the same pilot-scale bubbl e column reactor. In all the experiments the 
disappearance of the winery wastewater orga nic load was describe d by pseudo-first order Abstract 
 
 
 xviiapparent reaction kinetics. The faster rate constant (6.5 x 10-3 min-1), at the natural pH of 
the wastewater, was observed with the O 3/UV/H 2O2 process under optimised oxidant dose 
(COD/H 2O2 = 2). An economical analysis on the operating costs of the AOPs processes 
investigated revealed the O 3/UV/H 2O2 to be the most economical process (1.31 Euro m-3g-1 
of TOC mineralised under optimised condi tions) to treat the winery wastewater. 
Finally, the degradation of the organic pollu tants present in winery wastewater was 
carried out by the combinati on of two successive steps: a long term aerated storage 
bioreactor followed by a chemical oxidation pr ocess using Fenton’s reag ent. The long term 
hydraulic retention time, 11 weeks, contribute d remarkably to the reduction of COD (about 
90%) and the combination with the Fenton’s reagent led to a high overall COD reduction 
that reached 99.5% when the mass ratio (R=H 2O2/COD) used was equal to 2.5, 
maintaining constant the molar ratio H 2O2/Fe2+=15.

 xixRESUMO  
 
 
A presente tese de doutoramento pr etende contribuir para o estudo e o 
desenvolvimento de tecnologias de oxidação avançada aplicadas a dois tipos de águas 
residuais: efluentes têxteis e efluentes vinícolas. 
O objectivo principal deste trabalho foi o de compreender a aplicação de vários 
Processos de Oxidação Avançada (POA) e determin ar os principais factores operacionais 
que condicionam a degradação de certos tipos de compostos e a decomposição da matéria 
orgânica presente em águas residuais têxteis e em efluentes vinícolas. Estes tipos de águas 
residuais foram seleccionados como alvo de  estudo por duas ordens de razões. Em 
primeiro lugar, porque constituem problemas ambientais relevantes na região Norte de 
Portugal. De facto, encontra-se um grande nú mero de indústrias têxteis dispersas pelos 
distritos do Porto e Braga, especialmente na bacia hidrográfica do Ave, enquanto a 
produção de vinho assume uma particular im portância na Região Demarcada do Douro. 
Em segundo lugar, porque se pretendiam est udar efluentes contendo compostos de origem 
sintética (designadamente os co rantes têxteis) e, em contra ponto, estudar águas residuais 
geradas por processos agrícola s caracterizadas pela presença preponderante de matéria 
orgânica de origem natural, selecciona ndo-se, neste caso, os efluentes vinícolas. 
Estruturalmente, a primeira parte do trab alho é dedicada ao estudo da descoloração 
de soluções do corante sintético Reactive Blac k 5 (RB5). O corante RB5 foi seleccionado 
como composto modelo para representar os corantes têxteis uma vez que apresenta uma difícil biodegradabilidade e é muito utilizado na indústria têxtil. In icialmente fez-se a 
comparação experimental entre dois sist emas de foto-oxidação, Fenton/UV-C e 
ferrioxalato/H
2O2/radiação solar. As variáveis consid eradas foram: pH, concentração de 
H2O2, concentração de ião ferroso, concentração de RB5 e fonte de radiação. Os ensaios 
indicam que as soluções de RB5 podem ser efectivamente descoloradas usando Fenton/UV-C e ferrioxalato/H
2O2/radiação solar com uma pequena diferença entre os dois 
processos, 98,1 e 93,2%, respectivamente, a pós um período de 30 minutos. Apesar da 
escassa diferença de descolor ação verificada entre os dois POA, é nítido um incremento 
significativo na remoção de carbono orgânico  total (COT) com o processo Fenton/UV-C 
(46,4% de remoção de COT) comparativ amente com o processo ferrioxalato/H 2O2/luz 
solar (29,6% de remoção de COT). Este facto revela que a fonte de radiação utilizada, Resumo 
 
 
 xx lâmpada de mercúrio de baixa pressão (UV-C), é particularmente importante na 
mineralização do corante RB5 quando comparada com a luz solar. 
Foi depois testada a descoloração da so lução aquosa de RB5 com o reagente de 
Fenton (H 2O2/Fe2+) combinado com um processo bi ológico aeróbio (desenvolvido pela 
levedura Candida oleophila ). O processo Fenton e o tratamento aeróbio pela Candida 
oleophila  mostraram, individualmente, uma capac idade significativa para descolorar 
soluções de RB5 com concentrações até 200 mg/L, no período de 1 e 24 horas, 
respectivamente. Por outro lado, nem o reagente de Fenton nem a levedura Candida 
oleophila  apresentaram de per si  uma capacidade apreciável para descolorar soluções com 
concentrações elevadas de corante (300 e 500 mg/L). No entanto, a combinação dos dois processos anteriores: reagente de Fenton, como tratamento prim ário, utilizando as 
concentrações de 1,0x10
-3 mol L-1 de H 2O2 e 1,0x10-4 mol L-1 de Fe2+, com a levedura 
Candida oleophila , como tratamento secundário, permitiram alcançar uma remoção de cor 
de aproximadamente 91% para uma con centração inicial de RB5 de 500 mg L-1. 
Numa segunda fase, é apresentado o trabal ho experimental realizado com efluentes 
vinícolas. Este estudo teve início com a av aliação da capacidade de diferentes POA, 
quando combinados com várias fontes de radiaç ão, em degradarem o ácido gálico: o ácido 
fenólico presente em maior quantidade nos efluentes vinícolas e considerado como 
composto modelo neste estudo. Através dos ensa ios realizados foi possível verificar que o 
processo foto-Fenton (Fe2+ + H 2O2 + UV TNN 15/32), foi o que apresentou maior 
eficiência na degradação do re ferido ácido, 95,6% em 7,5 minutos. 
Posteriormente, foi estudada a degradação de um efluente vinícola simulado, numa 
escala piloto, usando um reac tor solar do tipo “Compound Parabol ic Collector” (CPC). Foi 
avaliada a redução do teor em carbono orgânico  total (COT) por fotocatálise heterogénea 
(TiO 2) e por fotocatálise homogénea (foto-Fenton). Os ensaios de fotocatálise heterogénea 
com TiO 2, TiO 2/H2O2 e TiO 2/S2O82- revelaram-se ineficientes na remoção de COT 
atingindo, na melhor das situações, degradaçõ es de 10%, 11% e 25%, respectivamente. 
Nas experiências realizadas com o processo  foto-Fenton foi possível atingir 46% de 
degradação de COT no efluente simulado prep arado com vinho diluído e 93% no efluente 
simulado preparado com sumo de uva. Se o etanol presente no efluente simulado for 
previamente eliminado por “air stripping” é possível atingir uma remoção de 96% do 
carbono orgânico total. Resumo 
 
 
 xxiA ozonização de compostos orgânicos presen tes no efluente vinícola foi estudada 
em escala piloto recorrendo a um reactor “bubble column”.  A redução progressiva da 
carência química de oxigénio (CQO) foi obser vada através da acção do ozono sobre as 
águas residuais a pH natural (pH 4). A pH alcalino e neutro a ta xa de degradação foi 
acelerada pela formação de espécies radicais geradas a partir da decomposição do ozono. A 
monitorização do pH, do potencial de oxid ação-redução (ORP), da aromaticidade 
(absorvância a 254 nm), dos polifenóis totais e do consumo de ozono foram correlacionados com a oxidação das espécies or gânicas na água residual. Estudou-se a 
ozonização de efluentes vinícolas no reactor “bubble column” em função do equilíbrio molar em conjunto com a cinética de ozonização modelada pela teoria dos dois filmes de 
transferência de massa e de reacção química.  Deduziu-se que a reacção de ozonização pode 
desenvolver-se em regimes cinéticos difere ntes: rápido, moderado e lento, dependendo das 
condições experimentais. 
Avaliou-se ainda a efic iência de diferentes POA baseados em ozono (O
3, O 3/UV e 
O3/UV/H 2O2) no tratamento dos efluentes vinícola s no reactor “bubble column” à escala 
piloto. A redução da carga orgânica dos eflu entes vinícolas foi descrita como uma reacção 
de pseudo-1ª ordem em todos os ensaios. A c onstante de velocidade de degradação mais 
rápida (6,5x10-3 min-1), a pH natural, foi obtida para o processo O 3/UV/H 2O2 em condições 
optimizadas (COD/H 2O2 = 2). Uma análise económica sobre os custos de operação dos 
POA investigados revelou que o processo mais competitivo para tratar os efluentes vinícolas é o processo O
3/UV/H 2O2 (com custos de 1,31 Euro  
m-3 g-1 de COT mineralizado sob condições optimizadas).  
Finalmente, estudou-se a degradação da car ga orgânica presente em efluentes 
vinícolas através da combinação de duas etap as sucessivas: uma primeira, envolvendo o 
tratamento biológico aeróbio com um longo tem po de residência, seguido por um processo 
de oxidação química utilizando o reagente de Fenton. O tempo prolongado de retenção hidráulica no biorreactor, 11 semanas, cont ribuiu notavelmente para a redução de CQO 
(cerca de 90%). A combinação posterior co m o reagente de Fenton conduziu a uma 
redução global de CQO de 99,5% qu ando a razão mássica aplicada (R = H
2O2/COD) foi 
igual a 2,5, mantendo-se constante a razão molar H 2O2/Fe2+ = 15. Nomenclature

1.1. The water resource 
 
Water is an essential com pound for all forms of life on Earth and its quality is 
crucial for the future of Humanity. Many sour ces have been exhausted and other sources 
are likely to be polluted due to the indus trial activity, with sp ecial impact among the 
developed or developing countries. Accord ing to the United Na tions World Health 
Organization (WHO), lack of ad equate sanitary facilities and poor hygienic practices are 
common throughout the developing countries, due  to political, economical and climatic 
reasons (WHO, 2005) (Figure 1.1). 
Due to the high population density (Earth 
population almost doubled in the last 30 years) and to the increasing level of industrialization, the 
hydrosphere became much more polluted with organic and inorganic compounds. The hydrosphere 
covers about 73% of land ar ea. The entire water is 
distributed for the oceans, biosphere, continents and 
in the different layers of the atmosphere. In the oceans the mass of water is estimated around 1.37 x10
21 kg (van Loon and Duffy, 2000). 
This value corresponds to 97% of water on Earth. In turn, the mass of freshwater 
represents only 3% of total resources of wa ter and are mainly in the polar caps (79%). 
From the total volume of freshwater a pproximately 20% corresponds to groundwater 
remaining. Therefore, only about 1% is availa ble at the Earth’s surf ace distributed by the 
biomass, rivers, lakes, soil and in the form of vapour in atmosphere. 
The distribution of freshwater throughout  the world makes its quality highly 
variable in terms of chemical, physical a nd microbiological composition. In addition to 
natural phenomena, this variability in water quality is also due to the influence of anthropogenic processes. The use of water by man, from agriculture to the several 
industrial activities,  with the inherent increase of chem icals dissolved in it, promotes the 
reduction of water quality with consequent pr oduction of liquid wastewaters deprived of 
treatment. Around 1.2 billion people in the wo rld have no access to safe drinking water 
(Inglezakis and Poulopoulos, 2006).  
Figure 1.1  –Water in the third world. Chapter 1. Introduction 
 
 2 More than eight million compounds are chemically characterized, of these, 
approximately 60 000 are traded in Europe. Howe ver, only a part is evaluated in terms of 
toxic and other unknown eff ects on public health. Most po llutants resulting from oil 
refining, chemical and textile industry, use of oil for transport and heating, use of 
pesticides, fertilizers and detergents. Furt hermore, it is also necessary quantify the 
domestic effluent, the uncontrolled release of hazardous wastes and accidental spills (Ollis 
et al., 1989). The effluents generated by thes e and other anthropogeni c activities cause a 
serious imbalance in the environment since they are released into the atmosphere (such as particulate matter or gases), soil (such as fertilizers and pesticides) or means receptors 
(such as industrial effl uent or wastewater). 
In Europe, environmental and consequently  water-related policies are promoted by 
the European Parliament. The European Un ion has established a Community framework 
for water protection and management. The fr amework Directive provides, among other 
things, the identification of European waters  and their characteristic s, based on individual 
river basin districts, and th e adoption of management plan s and programmes of measures 
appropriate for each body of water. The mo st recent update is the European Water 
Framework Directive 2000/60/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23
th 
October 2000, establishing a framework for comm unity action in the field of water policy 
(EU, 2000). This directive replaces, harmonises and further develops the community controls under Council Directive 76/464/EEC. The framewor k directive identifies different 
specific uses of water, such as drinking water, bathing water, water suitable for fish-breeding, shellfish water quality a nd urban wastewater treatment. 
The need to restore water for new uses ma kes purification of wa stewater practically 
essential to achieve a desired degree of qua lity. To this end, other suitable wastewater 
treatment technologies have to be studied. Re cently, an important class of technologies 
named Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) ha s emerged as suitable for accelerating the 
oxidation and destruction of a wide range of or ganic contaminants in polluted water (Glaze 
et al., 1987).  
1.2. Textile industry 
 
The textile industry consumes large quantities of water and chemicals, from 
polymers to inorganic salts and organic comp ounds, producing large volumes of effluent Chapter 1. Introduction 
 3
(Paar et al., 2001). This industry plays an important part in the economy of several 
countries in the world. China is  the largest exporter of te xtile products around the world, 
and the European Union (mainly Italy, Germany, France and Un ited Kingdom), USA, 
Japan, Pakistan, Turkey, Taiwan and Korea are th e top ten of world exporters (Rocha et al., 
2006).  
Portuguese textiles and clothes (Figure 1.2) have permitted to Portugal to hold a 
relevant position in the ranking of expor ters from the Europ ean Union. Since 2000, 
Portugal has been ranked in th e first ten highest e xporters of textiles in the European 
Union, corresponding to 4.3% of the total expor tations and 18.5% of national exportations 
(Figueiredo, 2002). In Portugal th e textile industry is concentrat ed in three regions: North, 
Centre and Lisbon. It is however  evident a slight in crease of this industr y in the North and 
even Centre of the country when compared with the Lisbon zone (Vasconcelos, 2006). The 
biggest factories of the most important industries wi thin the textile sector can be found 
spreading throughout Porto and Br aga districts, especially in the Ave hydrographic basin. 
The wastewater resulting fr om textile dyeing industry 
processes are a dangerous source of environmental 
contamination (Solozhenko et al., 1995), since they produce 
about 100 litres per kilogram of  dyed tissue (Abdullah et al., 
2000). This shows high values of Chemical Oxygen Demand 
(COD), Total Solids (TS), high pH, temperature fluctuating according to the industrial process involved, high amounts of surfactants and intense colour. These may also present high concentrations of heavy metals  such as chromium, copper and 
mercury used sometimes in dyes’ formulation (Grau, 1991). Thus, given the high pollution load, the discharge of textile effluents into  the surrounding water bodies is a serious 
problem, not only from an aesthetic  point of view but also due to  its toxicity to aquatic life 
(Chung and Stevens, 1993). Similarly these repr esent a potential mutagenic character to 
humans (Chung et al., 1992). 
The textile activity is regulated by the “P ortaria Sectorial” nº 423/97 of June 25
th and 
by Annex XVIII of Decree Law no 236/98 of August 1st, with the objective to compel for 
an efficient treatment of text ile effluents (Figueiredo, 2002).

 4 1.2.1 Dyes 
 
Dyes are chemical compounds characterised by absorbing in the visible region of 
the electromagnetic spectrum (400 to 700 nm). This is the reason why they are coloured. 
Their application over th e different affined substrates (textile  materials, leather, paper, hair, 
etc.) is performed from a liquid in which they are completely or partially soluble (Zollinger, 1991). 
The use of dyes is made by Man since the beginning of Humanity since the 
painting and staining their clothe s, their skin and the spaces occupied, such as rocks and 
caves. The wide availability of inorganic pigm ents of natural origin, such as manganese 
oxides, hematite and ochre, facilitated the use of “colours” by the first humans in many 
different functions. It was detect ed the presence of dye in samples of tissue in the Egyptian 
tombs and ancient hieroglyphics dating fr om 2500 BC. The natural organic dyes, 
originating mainly from plants , insects, snails, fungi and lic hens, were always used as 
preferred colours of fabrics. 
Dyes are classified based on two criteria  (both used by the Colour Index (Colour 
Index International, 2002), which lists all dye s and pigments commercially used for large 
scale colouration purposes): according to thei r chemical structure or according to their 
method of application over the substrate. The Colour Index is published since 1924 (and 
revised every three months) by the Society of  Dyers and Colourists and the American 
Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists. 
In particular, the chemical structure cl assification divides them into azo dyes, 
triarylmethanes, diphenyl-methanes, anthraqu inones, stilbenes, methines, polymethines, 
xanthenes, phthalocyanines, sulf urs and so on. Usually the setti ng of the dye to  the fibre is 
made through chemical reactions or by adsorp tion of the dye or derivatives generated by 
chemical reactions during the process of dye ing (van der Zee, 2002). Figure 1.1 sets out 
some textile dyes belonging to different cl asses and different modes of application.  
 Chapter 1. Introduction 
 5Figure 1.3  – Molecular structure of some textile azo dyes. 
 
Azo dyes can be divided into monoazo, diazo  and triazo classes, according to the 
presence of one or more azo bonds (–N=N–). Ne vertheless, according to  the classifications 
above mentioned, they are found in various ot her categories, i.e. acid, basic, direct, 
disperse, reactive, azoic and pigments (Rafols and Barcel o, 1997; Vandevivere et al., 
1998). N

 6 Some azo dyes and their dye precursors have  been shown to be or are suspected to 
be human carcinogens as they form toxic aromatic amines (Brown and DeVito, 1993; 
Stylidi et al., 2003; Silva and Faria, 2003). Actually, azo dyes make up 60-70% of all 
textile dyestuffs and are not removed from  wastewaters via c onventional biological 
treatments (Carliell et al., 1995).  
Within the azo dyes, the most used are the reactive dyes. Th ese dyes have been 
identified as the most problematic compounds in  textile dye effluents (Carliell et al., 1994, 
Carliell et al., 1996). They are characterised by  their readily water so lubility as well as 
their high stability and persiste nce, essentially due to their complex structure and synthetic 
origin. Since they are intenti onally designed to resist degrad ation, they consequently offer 
a large resistance against chemical and phot olytic degradation. Moreover, as many of 
textile dyes, reactive dyes are usually non biode gradable under typical aerobic conditions 
found in conventional biological treatment sy stems (Brown and Ha mburger, 1987). They 
are usually of non toxic natu re, they may generate, under anaerobic conditions (e.g., in 
anaerobic sediments and in intestinal envi ronments), breakdown products as aromatic 
amines considered to be pot entially carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic (Pinheiro et al., 
2004; van der Zee and Villaverde, 2005).  
1.2.2.  Dyes and the environment 
 
The industry has generated over the past decades, millions of tons of synthetic dyes. 
Over 700 tons of about 10 000 different dyes an d pigments are used annually worldwide. 
The main route by which the dyes affect the e nvironment is through effluents from textile 
industries. The pollution of water bodies with  these compounds results , in addition to the 
visual impact, in changes of flora and fauna bi ological cycles of the ecosystem receiver. To 
assess the degree of impact, each class of dye mu st be taken into account, in addition to the 
amount of colour produced, the degree of attach ment to the fibres and the consequent loss 
to the wastewater. Table 1.1 presents for each cl ass of dye, the rate of  attachment to the 
fibres and the percentage of dye lost to the effluent.

Due to the high molar extinction coefficient, the colours are visible in water even at 
concentrations as low as 1 mg/L. So, to get an idea of the seriousness of the problem it is 
important to stress that the textile industry generates wastewater w ith concentrations of 
dyes that can vary between 5 and 1500 mg /L (Pierce, 1994). By decreasing the 
transparency of the water and prevent the pe netration of solar radiation, these compounds 
decrease the coloured photosynthetic activity and cause disturbances in the solubility of 
gases, causing damage to the gills of aquatic organisms and disrupt their places of refuge 
and spawning. These compounds can remain for decades in aqua tic environments 
endangering the stability and lives of these ecosystems. 
The degradation products of the dyes in th ese environments and in Humans may be 
more harmful than the dyes themselves. This is due to breaking of azo connections that 
could origin aromatic amines potentially carcinogenic and/or mutagenic (Brown and 
Devito, 1997; Cisneros et al., 2002; El-Dein et al., 2003; Meriç et al., 2004; Pinheiro et al., 
2004). Another serious problem of textile dyes is their high chemical stability, enabling 
them to remain unchanged for long periods of time. This favours bioaccumulation phenomena and toxicity to the flora and fauna present in natural ecosystems. 
 
1.2.3.  Textile wastewater treatment processes 
 
The removal of dyes from wastewater in the textile industry is one of the major 
environmental problems faced by the textile sect or (Correia et al., 1994). In general, the Chapter 1. Introduction 
 
 8 current practice in textile mills is to discha rge the wastewater directly into the local 
environment or into the municipal sewer syst em. In any case, to accomplish with current 
local legislations (which are becoming more st ringent), textile mills are sometimes forced 
to have their own treatment plant prior discha rge. A varied range of methods have been 
developed for textile wastewater treatment at laboratory, pilot or full scale.  
The technologies most widely used are membrane filtration (inverse osmosis, 
microfiltration, nanofiltration and ultrafiltra tion), adsorption (activated carbon, inorganic 
adsorbents, ion exchange resins and natural and synthetic biosorbents), 
coagulation/flocculation, biol ogical treatments (mainly c onventional aerobic activated 
sludge treatments) and chemical oxidation (e.g., electrochemical methods) (Reife and 
Freeman, 1996; Vandevivere et al., 1998; Robison et al., 2001;  Forgacs et al., 2004; Rai et 
al., 2005). However, its efficiency is sometim es limited by several factors. Coagulation-
flocculation, adsorption, foam flotation and membrane filtration ar e common practices, but 
result in a phase transfer of pollutants, leading to another form of waste, such as spent 
carbon or sludge, that would require additional tr eatment or disposal (e.g., incineration). In 
view of that, destructive methods  such as chemical or biologi cal processes are desirable.  
Biological processes are a good choice for wastewater treatment. The aerobic 
biological treatment of textile effluents most commonly used is the activated sludges. They 
are relatively inexpensive, the running cost s are low and the end products of complete 
degradation are not toxic (Forga cs et al., 2004). However, due to the refractory nature of 
some constituents of the effluents, the biological treatment by activated sludge is sometimes quite difficult. The refractory char acter displayed by these effluents should be 
on the physical and chemical stability of textile dyes and their low content of biodegradable organic matter creates a hi gh resistance to thei r degradation by 
microorganisms. In particular, reactive dyes, acid and direct are hardly biodegradable 
passing, in most cases, unchanged by the traditi onal methods of treatment because of their 
high solubility and low molecular weight  (Reife and Freeman, 1996). The anaerobic 
biological treatment has shown good results in the remova l of colour from textile effluents. 
However, these processes have the potential disadvantage of convert ing dyes into more 
toxic products than the original dyes. This increa se in toxicity is due to the breaking of the 
links with the consequent rise of carcinoge nic aromatic amines formation (Brown and 
Devito, 1997; McMullan et al., 2001). Chapter 1. Introduction 
 9Membrane filtration can be applied mainly to the separation of salts and large 
molecules such as dyes. These technologies are very attractive because they allow the 
reuse of water in industry. Its major limitati ons are the high cost a nd potential clogging of 
the membranes. This last limitation involve s the frequent cleani ng and replacement of 
filtration membranes with consequent increased costs.  
The adsorption technologies are limited to the amount of flow produced since high 
flow rates for these techniques are not feasible  due to rapid saturation of the adsorbents, 
leading to its regeneration. This limitation plus  the fact that both adsorption process and 
membrane filtration are not destructive. Th is technology is essentially limited to the 
contaminants phase transfer and does not allo w the definitive elimination of the dyes. 
The use of coagulation/flocculation processe s for decolourisation of high flow rates 
of textile effluents is very expensive, mainly due to large quantities of reagents required (e.g. lime, aluminium sulphate, chloride, iron ) for an effective treatment. Moreover, the 
high production of sludge is also a factor  to take into account given the economic 
evaluation of this technology as  the treatment/disposal of slu dge produced is significantly 
expensive. Thus, considering the obvious difficu lty of treatment of effluents from textile 
industry, in particular the re moval of colour, there should be the study of one or more 
alternative treatment processes that allow total removal of the colour of the final effluent, 
preferably without the generation of sl udge, with obvious economical, aesthetic and 
environmental advantages. 
Therefore, chemical processes are dest ructive alternatives when biological 
treatments are not capable to reduce both colo ur and COD from text ile wastewater. Among 
them, Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have been proposed in the last years as 
powerful advanced technologies for the treatm ent of biorecalcitrant organic compounds 
(Legrini et al., 1993). With their incorporatio n, the complete decontamination of textile 
wastewaters becomes realistic.        Chapter 1. Introduction 
 
 10 1.3 Winery wastewater 
 
Wastewaters from the wine-producing, na med as winery wastewaters (WW), are 
mainly originated from various washing opera tions during the crushi ng and pressing of 
grapes, as well as rinsing of fermentation tank s, barrels, bottles and other equipments or 
surfaces (Arnaiz et al., 2007). Volumes and pol lution loads significantly change over the 
year, in relation to the working period (vinta ge, racking, bottling) and to the winemaking 
technologies used (e.g. in the production of re d, white and special wines (Rochard, 1995)). 
The wineries have seasonal activity. Therefore, the wastewater production occurs 
mainly during harvesting and at the time of wine making. The wastew aters can be treated 
as they are produced, or they  can be stored (generally after good sieving) and treated 
within several months. The objectives of wast ewater management are to be protective of 
the receiving environment and enhance wate r reuse opportunities. Reduction of organic 
strength, measured as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5) or chemical oxygen demand 
(COD), is the single most important wastewater  treatment parameter necessary monitorizes 
to reach a supported vineyard. The organic conten t of winery wastewater consists of highly 
soluble sugars, alcohols, acids and recalci trant high-molecular-w eight compounds (e.g., 
polyphenols, tannins and lignins) not easily removable by physical or chemical means 
alone. 
There are several types of treatment sy stems for the management of winery 
wastewaters. However, due to rapidly increasing global demand on manufacturing 
processes and to the fact that final product exert minimal or no envi ronmental f ootprints 
(Wackernagel et al., 1996), the wine industry has begun to experience legislative pressure 
to become more efficient and environmentally fr iendly (Katsiri et al., 1994; Müller et al., 
1999). Thus, the increasing demand for green ing of industrial production processes and 
products, both from customers and legislative authorities, coupled with rising operational 
and waste treatment costs in the wine industry has started to move to wards the adoption of 
integrated waste preventive approaches, as opposed to the traditional reparatory 
environmental engineering pract ices (Lorenzen et al., 2000). 
    Chapter 1. Introduction

1.3.1 Production process and sources of wastewaters 
 
Winemaking, or vinification, is the production of wine, st arting with selection of 
the grapes and ending with bo ttling of wine. Although most wine  is made from grapes, it 
may also be made from other fruit or non-toxic plant material. Mead is a wine that is made 
with honey being the primary i ngredient after water. The ma in stages of the production 
process of a winery are as follows  (Vlyssides et al., 2005; Pirra, 2005): 
 
1. Grape reception : Grapes are usually 
harvested from the vineyard (Figure 1.4) in the autumn (fall), in the north ern hemisphere from early 
September until the beginning of November. The produced wastewater from this stage comes from the washing of the mechanical machinery and that of the floors.  
2. Crushing : Crushing is the process of squeeze the berries and break the skins to 
start to liberate its content (Figure 1.5). The grapes come  through a pneumatic press and 
produce the must and the solid residues. The produced amount of must is about 80 L/100 
kg of grapes. The wastewater generated from this stage comes from the washing of the machinery, the washing of the production room, the loss of must due to its transfer to the 
fermentation vessels as well as the pre-washing of the fermentation vessels. The amount of water that is used for the cleaning of the fermentation ve ssels and the wine storage 
tanks depends on the size of the tanks. 
 
3. Fermentation : This takes place in the fermentation 
vats (Figure 1.6) and lasts about 15 days for each tank from the 
day they are filled with 80% must. During the fermentation, the yeast cells feed on the sugars in the must and multiply, producing carbon dioxide gas and alcohol. From this stage, no 
wastewater is produced.   
         Figure 1.4  – Vineyard. 
 
      Figure 1.5  – Grape crushing . 
 
Figure 1.6  – Fermentation vats. Chapter 1. Introduction 
 
 12 
4. Decanting : During the decanting, the supernatant wine is separated from the 
produced wine lees and is fed by pumps to em pty tanks that are filled 100% for further 
stabilization. The produced wastewater from this stage comes from the washing of the 
tanks, from the pre-washing of the stabilizatio n tanks, from the cleaning of the decanting 
pump, from the washing of the production ro om as well as from losses during wine 
decanting. 
 
5. Maturation and stabilization : Stabilization is 
a process used in winemaking to reduce tartrate crystals 
(generally potassium bitartrate) in wine. It takes place in the tanks (Figure 1.7) and lasts about 15 days for each tank from the day it is filled 100% with decanted wine. From this stage, there is no wastewater produced.  
6. Filtration : The produced wine is filtered in order to improve its quality and is 
used to accomplish two objectives, clarif ication and microbial stabilization. In 
clarification, large particles th at affect the visual appearance  of the wine are removed. In 
microbial stabilization, organisms that aff ect the stability of the wine are removed 
therefore reducing the likelihood of re-fermentation or spoila ge. The produced wastewater 
of this stage comes from the washing of th e tanks, from the pre-washing of the storage

1.3.2 Winery wastewater treatment processes 
 
Musts and wines constituents are present in winery wa stewaters (Figure 1.11), in 
variable proportions: sugars, et hanol, esters, glycerol, organi c acids (e.g. citric, tartaric, 
malic, lactic, acetic) phenolic compounds and a numerous population of bacteria and yeas ts. Effluents have a daily 
great variability, in both quantity and quality, making evaluation of daily pollution co mplex. Rejected volumes per 
volume of produced wine vary from one wine to another, with extreme values comprised between 0.1 m
3/m3 and 
2.4m3/m3. Table 1.2 presents some characteristics of winery 
wastewaters from different wineries.

Among the several biological and chemi cal processes applied to winery 
wastewaters it is possible highlight the follo wing: anaerobic digest ion, aerated lagoons, 
activated-sludge units , adsorption on activated carbon and coagulation/flocculation. 
Anaerobic digestion is partic ularly suitable for winery wastewater due to the high 
organic content of these wastewaters and wi dely accepted as a first treatment step. The 
high organic content allied to the COD/N/P ratio is inappropriate  for direct aerobic 
treatment - which needs phosphorus and ni trogen addition. The COD/N/P ratio for 
anaerobic treatment may be in th e order of 800/5/1 (Moletta, 2005). 
Aerobic systems, such as aerated lagoons  or activated -sludge units, are hence 
frequently used to remove the pollution ge nerated by wastewaters from agro-industrial 
plants (Brenes et al., 2000). The activated-s ludge process was developed in England in 
1914 by Ardern & Lockett (1914) and was so- called because it involved the production of 
an activated mass of microrganisms capable of stabilising a waste aerobically. Several 
versions of the original pro cess are still in use nowadays, but fundamentally they are all 
similar.  
In Figure 1.12 it is show the efficiency  comparison of different biological 
treatments applied to winery wastewater s, presenting COD removals among 65 and 98% 
(Andreotolla, 2009). Although this significant organic matter degrad ation, the aerobic 
processes have high-operating costs and gene rate large quantities of waste sludge which Chapter 1. Introduction

Winery wastewater production occurs 
mainly during harvesting and at  the wine making period. This  seasonal activity of the 
wineries becomes the biological wastewater treatment process selection (aerobic or 
anaerobic) very important. The main question is  if the wastewaters wi ll be treated when 
they are being produced or stored and treate d within several months. If it is possible to 
create a storage tank, both processes can be ap plied. But if it is not possible to construct a 
tank to the wastewaters storage, for example, du e to the smallest available area, the aerobic 
treatment may not be viable because this proc ess needs a permanently feed of wastewater 
during all the year and the seas onal activity of this industry does not  allow that supply.  
 
Figure 1.12  – Efficiency comparison of different biological treatments applied to winery wastewaters 
(Andreotolla, 2009). 
 
Adsorption on activated carbon (AC) is wi dely employed for colour removal and 
specific organic pollutants due to its extend ed surface area, microporus structure, high 
adsorption capacity and high degree of surf ace reactivity. Studies on decolourization of 
distillery spentwash include adsorption on co mmercial as well as indigenously prepared 
activated carbons (Bernardo et al., 1997; Chandra and Pandey, 2000; Mane et al., 2006). 
Coagulation and flocculation with alum a nd iron salts was not effective for colour 
removal in fermentation industry effluents, due  to the nature of colour causing compounds 
which are almost totally dissolved and resist ant to biodegradation (Inanc et al., 1999). 
However, it was explored lime treatment w ith anaerobically digested effluent. The Chapter 1. Introduction 
 17optimum dosage of lime was found to be 10.0 g/L resulting in 82.5% COD removal and 
67.6% reduction in colour in a 30 min period.  
Biological oxidation is the pr ocess of wastewater treatment plants where most of 
the organic content is removed. Several pol lutants can be fully biodegraded by the 
microorganisms in such processes, whereas many physical and chemical processes just 
concentrate the pollutants or tr ansfer them from one medium to another. Unfortunately, not 
all compounds are biodegradable. Wastewater submitted to biological oxidation should be 
free of substances resistant to biodegradation or toxic to the bioculture. A possible way to 
overcome these problems could be the intr oduction of treatment schemes combining 
chemical and biological processes: a chemical  treatment would typically be a pre-treatment 
of non-biodegradable or toxic wastewater (once many oxidati on products of biorefractory 
pollutants are easily biodegradable) or a chemi cal process applied as polishing step after 
biological treatment.  
1.4 Advanced Oxidation Processes 
 
A wide range of sewage treatment te chnologies are available on the market. 
However, considering that the effluents to be treated are often composed by substances 
with high toxicity, to destroy the pollutants is  more effective than simply transfer them 
from stage. Therefore in recent years new processes have been studied and developed seeking the total oxidati on of contaminants or their conve rsion into less toxic compounds. 
These processes are known as Advan ced Oxidation Processes (AOPs).  
Advanced Oxidation Processes were defined by Glaze et al., (1987) as the near 
ambient temperature and pressure water treatm ent processes which i nvolve the generation 
of highly reactive radicals (e specially hydroxyl radicals (HO
•)) in sufficient quantity to 
influence water purification. HO• radicals are extraordinarily reactive species that attack 
most of the organic molecules. The kinetics of  reaction is generally first order with respect 
to the concentration of hydroxyl radicals and to the concentr ation of the species to be 
oxidized. 
The AOPs are used to destroy the comple x refractory organic constituents even 
after treatment with conventional methods. Th ese processes have s hown great potential in 
the treatment of pollutants, either in high or in low concentrations. The ultimate goal of the 
oxidation process is to mineralize the organi c contaminants present in water in carbon Chapter 1. Introduction 
 
 18 dioxide, water and inorganic ions through degr adation reactions invol ving species strongly 
oxidizing. Rate constants are usually in the range of 108–1011 M-1s-1, whereas the 
concentration of hydroxyl radicals lays between 10-10 and 10-12 M, thus a pseudo-first order 
constant between 1 and 10-4 s-1 is obtained (Glaze and Kang, 1989). As it can be observed 
from Table 1.3, hydroxyl radicals are more pow erful oxidants than the chemical agents 
used in traditional chemical processes. 
The mechanism of reaction usually involve s the abstraction of a hydrogen atom or 
the addition to unsaturated carbon-carbon links , starting a sequence of  oxidative reactions 
that can lead to complete mineralization of  organic contaminant (O liveros et al., 1997).

The hydroxyl radicals can be generated by different oxidation processes, such as 
ozone (O 3), ultraviolet (UV) (Mans illa et al., 1997), hydrogen peroxide combined with 
ultraviolet radiation (H 2O2/UV), Fenton reagent (Fe2+/H2O2) (Walling, 1974), photo-
Fenton process (Pignatello, 1992), O 3/UV (Baxendale and Wilson, 1957), O 3/H2O2 and 
heterogeneous photocatalysis using semiconduct ors such as zinc oxide (ZnO) but mainly 
titanium dioxide (TiO 2) - TiO 2/UV process (Ollis and Al-Ekabi, 1993). Chapter 1. Introduction 
 191.4.1 Fenton’s reagent  
 
The Fenton reagent is a homogeneous catal ytic oxidation process which is the 
combination of an oxidizing agent (hydrogen pe roxide) and a catalyst  (an oxide or metal 
salt, usually iron) to produ ce hydroxyl radicals. The Fenton reaction was discovered by H. 
J. Fenton in 1894 (Fenton, 1894), when intended to oxidize polycarboxylic acids (malic 
acid and tartaric acid) with H 2O2 and noted that there was a strong promotion in the 
presence of ferrous ions (Fe2+). Forty years later the Habe r-Weiss (1934) mechanism was 
postulated, revealing that the effective oxida tive agent in the Fenton reaction was the 
hydroxyl radical (HO•). The hydroxyl radicals are genera lly referred to as the primary 
oxidizing chemical species generated in accordance with the fundamental equation 
(Walling, 1974):  
Fe
2+  +  H 2O2  →  Fe3+  +  HO-   +  HO•   (1.1)  
 
In the absence of light and complexing lig ands other than water, the most accepted 
mechanism of H 2O2 decomposition in acid homogeneous  aqueous solution, involves the 
formation of hydroxyperoxyl (HO 2•/O2-) and hydroxyl radicals HO• (De Laat and Gallard, 
H., 1999; Gallard and De Laat, 2000). The meta l regeneration can follow different paths. 
For Fe2+, the most accepted scheme is described in  the equations below (Sychev and Isak, 
1995). 
 
Fe3+  +  H 2O2  →  Fe2+  +  HO-  +  HO•   (1.2) 
Fe2+  +  HO•  →  Fe3+  +  HO-    (1.3) 
HO•  +  H 2O2  →  HO 2•  +  H 2O    (1.4) 
Fe3+  +  HO 2•  →  Fe2+  +  H+  +  O 2    (1.5) 
Fe3+  +  O 2•-  →  Fe2+  +  O 2     (1.6) 
Fe2+  +  HO 2•  →  Fe3+  +  HO 2-    (1.7) 
 
The Fenton reagent has been successfully  used in the degradation of several 
compounds such as chlorophenols (Kwon et al ., 1999), surfactants (Lin  et al., 1999), the 
oxidation of the leaching of landfill waste (Kang and Hwang, 2000) and the degradation of Chapter 1. Introduction 
 
 20 dyes, which was more advantageous than the hypochlorite, ozone and electrochemical 
processes (Szpyrkow icz et al., 2001). 
 
1.4.2 Photo-Fenton system 
 
The Fenton process can be highlighted in their ability to oxidize refractory 
compounds present in water and wastewater th rough the addition of u ltraviolet radiation 
(sunlight or artificial sources of UV radiation) to the classical Fenton reagent. Fenton reaction rates are strong ly increased by irradiation with UV/visible light (Ruppert et al., 
1993; Sun and Pignatello, 1993) (Figure 1.13). Du ring the reaction, Fe
3+ ions are 
accumulated in the system and after Fe2+ ions are consumed, the reaction practically stops. 
Photochemical regeneration (E q 1.8) of ferrous ions (Fe2+) by photoreduction of ferric ions 
(Fe3+) is the proposed mechanism (Faust and Hoigné, 1990). The new generated ferrous 
ions reacts with H 2O2 generating a second HO• radical and ferric ion, and the cycle 
continues.  
Fe(OH)
2+  +  hυ  →  Fe2+  +  HO•    (1.8) 
 
The research published by different author s shows that the combination of the 
Fenton reaction with conventiona l radiation zone of the vi sible and near ultraviolet 
(reaction of photo-assisted Fenton) gives a better performance in the degradation of 
organic pollutants such as 4-chlorophenol  (Bauer and Fallmann, 1997), nitrobenzene and 
anisole (Zepp et al., 1992), herbicides (Sun and Pignatello, 1993) or ethyleneglycol 
(McGinnis et al., 2000).  Chapter 1. Introduction 
 21 
 
Figure 1.13  - Sequence of reactions occurring in the photo-Fenton system. 
 
The hydroxylated ferric ion, Fe(OH)2+, the predominant complex of Fe2+ in acidic 
conditions in aqueous soluti on, can be reduced to Fe2+ by ultraviolet or visible radiation. 
The ion Fe(OH)2+ shows absorption bands between 290 and 400 nm. Thus, the reaction can 
be developed efficiently for a wavelength hi gher than those involved in other AOP as 
O3/UV or H 2O2/UV which require a wavelength < 300 nm (Huston and Pignatello, 1999). 
However, the effectiveness of the training of th e hydroxyl radical/iron ion decreases with 
increase in wavelength where a qua ntum yield of formation of HO• is 0.14 to 313 nm and 
only 0.017 at 360 nm (Pignatello, 1992).  
It also occurs to direct photolysis of H 2O2 (reaction 1.9). However, in the presence 
of iron complexes of strongly ab sorbing radiation, this reacti on will contribute only in 
small scale for the photodegrada tion of organic contaminants  (Safarzadeh-Amiri et al., 
1997).

 22 The pH optimum performance of the photo-Fent on process is considered to be pH = 3.0, 
when the hydroxy-Fe3+ complexes are more soluble and when the species Fe(OH)2+ are 
more photoactive, which is the predominant form of these complexes (Kim, 1999).  
1.4.3 Photo-ferrioxalate process  
 
Oxalic acid forms complexes with Fe(III) strongly absorb from 254 to 442 nm. The 
absorption corresponds to a ligand to metal charge transfer band, with ε
max values around 
103-104 M–1 cm–1. Photolysis of trisoxala toferrate(III) (ferrioxalate, FeOx) constitutes the 
most used chemical actinometer; the quantum yield of Fe2+ formation is high ( φ = 1.0 – 
1.2) and almost independent of the wave length (Hatchard a nd Parker, 1956). If H 2O2 is 
added, the photochemical reduction of the Fe(III)-complex will be coupled with a Fenton reaction (Eq. 1.1) (Zuo and Hoigné, 1992; Safarz adeh-Amiri et al., 1997). Thus, the use of 
illuminated mixtures of H
2O2 and FeOx is very efficien t for the photodegradation of 
organic contaminants: the energy required to treat the same volume of a selected wastewater is 20% of the energy requir ed by the common phot o-Fenton system 
(Safarzadeh-Amiri et al., 1996; Safarzadeh-A miri et al., 1997; Nogueira and Jardim, 1999). 
The main reactions in the photo/FeOx/H
2O2 system are described by the following 
sequence of reactions (Lee et al., 2003). After light absorption, oxalyl radical (C 2O4•–) is 
produced through a ligand to metal charge transfer:  
(Fe(C
2O4)3)3-  +  hν  →  Fe2+  +  2C 2O42-  +  C 2O4-•  (1.10) 
 
Then, a rapid decarboxylation take s place from the oxalyl radical: 
 
C2O4-•  →  CO 2•-  +  2CO 2     (1.11) 
 
The fate of CO 2•– depends on the competitive reactions between dissolved oxygen and 
ferrioxalate:  
C
2O4-•  +  (Fe(C 2O4)3)3-  →  Fe2+  +  3C 2O42-  +  2CO 2 (1.12) 
C2O4-•  +  O 2  →  O2-•  +  2CO 2    (1.13) 
 Chapter 1. Introduction 
 23The superoxide radical (or its conjugate acid) has three reaction pathways, 
depending on the oxidation state of iron or the H 2O2 concentration and the pH: 
 
HO 2• (or O 2•–)  +  Fe2+  +  H+(2H+)  →  Fe3+  +  H 2O2   (1.14) 
HO 2• (or O 2•–)  +  (Fe(C 2O4)3)3-  →  Fe2+  +  3C 2O42-  +  O 2  +  H+  (1.15) 
HO 2• (or O 2•–)  +  Fe(OH)2+  →  Fe2+  +  O 2  +  H 2O   (1.16) 
 
Equation (1.15) is the pre dominant one at high H 2O2 concentration (in the mM 
range) and acid pH, while at low H 2O2 concentration ( μM range), equation (1.14) is the 
preferred path. HO 2• can produce H 2O2 and O 2: 
 
HO 2•  +  HO 2•  (or O 2•–  +  H+)  →  H2O2  +  O 2    (1.17) 
 
Then, the Fenton equation (1.1) takes place. The method is useful to treat waters 
with high absorbance at λ < 300 nm, because of the high ferrioxalate absorption cross-
section in the 200 to 400 nm range. Solar light can be used, which becomes the technology 
very attractive from the economical point of  view. As previously mentioned, the energy 
required to treat the same volume of a wastew ater is about 20% of the energy required by 
the photo-Fenton system (Safarzadeh-Amiri et  al., 1997), and this high efficiency is 
attributed to the broad range of absorbance of  the reagent, and the high quantum yield of 
Fe2+ formation. The reagents are totally water soluble, and there are no mass transfer 
limitations. The process is cheap and the oxidant  is accessible. Ferrioxalate technology has 
been used for the treatment of aromatic and chloroaromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated 
ethylenes, ethers, alcohols, ketones and other compounds.  
 
1.4.4 Heterogeneous photocatalysis 
 
The basis of photocatalysis is the photoe xcitation of a semiconductor solid as a 
result of the absorptio n of radiation, often but not excl usively in the near ultraviolet 
spectrum. Under near UV irradiation, a suitab le semiconductor material may be excited by 
photons possessing energies of sufficient magni tude to produce conduction band electrons 
and valence band holes. These charge carriers are able to induce re duction or oxidation, 
respectively, and react with both water a nd organic compounds. The holes are extremely Chapter 1. Introduction 
 
 24 oxidant and should thus be able to oxidize almo st all chemicals, as well as water, resulting 
in the formation of hydroxyl radicals (Munter et al., 2001) . Many catalysts have been 
tested, although TiO 2 in the anatase form seems to possess the most interesting features, 
such as high stability, good pe rformance and low cost (Andreozzi  et al., 1999). It presents 
the disadvantage of the catalyst separation fr om solution, as well as the fouling of the 
catalyst by the organic matter. Minero et al., (1994) studied the photocatalytic degradation 
of nitrobenzene (NB) on TiO 2 and ZnO, reporting that complete mineralization with TiO 2 
was achieved. Mathews (1990) also reported mo re than 90% of NB  mineralization was 
achieved with TiO 2 and sunlight. Regarding 2,4-dichlo rophenol (DCP), almost complete 
mineralization was achieved in the study carri ed out by Ku and Hsieh (1992) with TiO 2 
and 6W 254 nm Hg lamp and showed to be fa ster in alkaline solutions. Giménez et al., 
(1999) also tested the photocatalytic treatment of DCP by using TiO 2 and solar light, 
proving that reaction was first order with resp ect to DCP concentration and comparing the 
efficiencies of two differe nt photocatalytic reactors. 
Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a process ba sed on the direct or indirect absorption 
of visible or UV radiant ener gy by a solid, normally a wide-band semiconductor. In the 
interfacial region between the excited solid and the solution, destru ction or removal of 
contaminants takes place, with no ch emical change in the catalyst.  
 
Figure 1.14  - TiO 2-semiconductor photocatalysis process. Representative scheme of some 
photochemical and photophysical events that migh t take place in an irradiated semiconductor 
particle. Chapter 1. Introduction 
 25Figure 1.14 shows a scheme of processes occurring in a particle of semiconductor 
when it is excited by energy light higher than that of the band gap. Under these conditions, 
electron-hole pairs are created, whose lifetim e is in the nanosecond range; during this time 
interval, electrons and holes migrate to th e surface and react with  adsorbed species, 
acceptors or donors (Mills and Le  Hunte, 1997). Electron-hole pairs that cannot separate 
and react with surface species, recombine with energy dissipa tion. The net process is the 
catalysis of the reaction between the oxidant and the reductant (for example, between O 2 
and organic matter). 
Various materials are candidates to act as photocatalysts such as, for example, 
TiO 2, ZnO, CdS, iron oxides, WO 3, ZnS, etc. These materials are economically available, 
and many of them participate in chemical pr ocesses in nature. Besides, most of these 
materials can be excited with light of a wavelength in the range of the solar spectrum ( λ > 
310 nm), therefore increasing the interest in the possible use of sunlight. So far, the most 
investigated photocatalysts are me tallic oxides, particularly TiO 2; given the fact that this 
semiconductor presents a high chem ical stability and it can be  used in a wide pH range, 
being able to produce electronic transitions by light absorption in the near ultraviolet range (UV-A). 
Heterogeneous photocatalysis over TiO
2 can also be combined with other AOTs. 
For example, addition of Fe(III) and H 2O2 combines UV/TiO 2 with photo-Fenton; in doing 
this, the destruction of some resistant po llutants can be improved. For example, EDTA, 
NTA and other oligocarboxylic acids are more  rapidly mineralized in the presence of 
Fe(III)/H 2O2 than when using TiO 2 alone (Babay et al., 2001) . Similarly, the presence of 
photochemical Fe(III) complexes such as Fe(I II)-NTA helps the photocatalytic degradation 
of 4-chlorophenol (Abida et al., 2004). In th ese cases, an important effect of the Fe(III)-
complexes formed with the initial compound or  with possible degradation intermediates 
takes place: these complexes can be photolyz ed and even photocatalyzed in the reaction 
medium, generating Fe(II) and other active radical species.  
1.4.5 Ozonation 
 
Ozone is a very powerful oxidi zing agent, which is able to participate in a great 
number of reactions with organic and i norganic compounds. Among the most common 
oxidizing agents, it is only surpassed in oxidant power by fluorine and hydroxyl radicals Chapter 1. Introduction 
 
 26 (Table 1.3). Since the beginning of the century the disinfectant power of ozone has been 
known. However it has been mainly during the la st two decades that this chemical agent 
acquired notoriety in wastewater treatment. Thus, the ozonation of dissolved compounds in 
water can constitute an AOP by itself, as hydroxyl radicals are generated from the 
decomposition of ozone, whic h is catalyzed by the hydroxyl ion or initiated by the 
presence of traces of other substances, like transition metal cations (Staehelin and Hoigné, 
1985). As the pH increases, so does the rate of decomposition of ozone in water. At pH 10, 
for example, the half-life of ozone in water may be less than one minute. In an ozonation 
process two possible pathways have to be considered: the direct pathway through the 
reactions with molecular ozone, and the radi cal pathway through the reactions of hydroxyl 
radicals generated in the ozone decompositi on and the dissolved compounds (Figure 1.15).  
The combination of both pathways for the removal of a compound will depend on 
the nature of these, the pH of the medium and the ozone dose (Beltrán et al., 1997). Thus, 
molecular ozone can directly react with dissolv ed pollutants by electrophilic attack of the 
major electronic density positions  of the molecule. This mechanism will take place with 
pollutants such as phenols, phenolates or tiocompounds. 
Reactions of molecular ozone normally take place through oz onolysis of a double 
bond or attack of nucleophilic centers, where aldehydes, ketones or carboxylic acids are 
obtained from double bonds; amides from nitrile s; amine oxides from amines, etc (Bailey, 
1972). The radical mechanism predominates in less reactive molecules,  such as aliphatic 
hydrocarbons, carboxylic acids, benzenes or chlorobenzenes (Hoigné and Bader, 1979). 
Usually under acidic conditions  (pH<4) the direct pathwa y dominates, above pH 10 
it changes to the radical. In  ground and surface water (pH ≈7) both pathways can be of 
importance (Staehelin and Hoigné, 1983). In spec ial wastewaters, even at pH=2 the radical 
oxidation can be of importance, depending much  on the contaminants present (Gottschalk 
et al., 2000). Both pathways should always be  considered when developing a treatment 
scheme.  Chapter 1. Introduction 
 27
 
Figure 1.15  - Scheme of reactions of ozone added to  an aqueous solution (Hoigné and Bader, 
1983a). 
 
The rate of attack by hydroxyl  radicals is typically 106 to 109 times faster than the 
corresponding reaction rate for molecular oz one. A great deal of studies have been 
undertaken about the reactivity of ozone with many pollutants and reaction-rate constants 
of several organic and inorganic compounds ha ve been establish (e.g. Hoigné and Bader, 
1983a,b). Besides the oxidation process, oz one decreases colour and turbidity.  
 
1.4.6 Ozone/UV  
 
The O 3/UV process is an effective method for the oxidation and destruction of toxic 
and refractory organics in water. Basicall y, aqueous systems saturated with ozone are 
irradiated with UV light of 253.7 nm . The extinction coefficient of O 3 at 253.7 nm is 3300 
M-1cm-1, much higher than that of H 2O2 (18.6 M-1cm-1). The decay rate of ozone is about a 
factor of 1000 higher than that of H 2O2 (Guittoneau et al., 1991). The AOP with ozone and 
UV radiation is initiated by the photolysis  of ozone. The photodecomposition of ozone 
leads to two hydroxyl radicals, which do not act as they recombine producing hydrogen 
peroxide (Peyton and Glaze, 1988):  
H
2O  +  O 3  +  hν  →  2 HO•  +  O 2    (1.18) 
2HO•  →  H2O2      (1.19) 
 Chapter 1. Introduction 
 
 28 This system contains three components to  produce OH radicals and/or to oxidize 
the pollutant for subsequent reactions: UV radiation, ozone a nd hydrogen peroxide. 
Therefore, the reaction mechanism of O 3/H2O2 as well as the combination UV/H 2O2 is of 
great importance. Considering that hydrogen pe roxide photolysis is very slow compared 
with the rate at which ozone is decomposed by HO 2-, it seems that a neutral pH reaction of 
ozone with HO 2- is the main pathway.  
 
Figure 1.16 - Scheme of the degradation mechanism by means of the O 3/UV process (Peyton and Glaze, 
1988). 
 
The efficiency of this process with diffe rent aromatic compounds has been studied by 
several authors. Gurol and Vatistas (1987) studied the photo lytic ozonation of  mixtures of 
phenol, p-cresol, 2,3-xylenol a nd catechol at acidic and ne utral pH. Guittoneau et al., 
(1990) reported that the O 3/UV process was found to be more efficient than the UV/H 2O2 
system for the degradation of p-chloronitrobenzene.  
1.4.7 Ozone/UV/H
2O2 
 
The addition of H 2O2 to the O 3/UV process accelerates decomposition of ozone 
resulting in increased rate of  OH radicals generation. In pro cesses targeted at pollutants Chapter 1. Introduction 
 29that are weak absorbers of UV radiation, it is more cost effective to ex ternally add 
hydrogenperoxide at reduced UV flux. This is a very powerful me thod that allows a 
considerable reduction of the TOC. This proce ss is the combination of the binary systems 
O3/UV and O 3/H2O2. The global equation for the O 3/UV/H 2O2 is obtained (1.20): 
 
2 O 3  +  H 2O2  +  hν → 2 HO•  +  3 O 2   (1.20) 
 
Zeff and Barich (1990) studied the oxida tion of different  organic compounds 
(methylene chloride, chlorobenzene, benzene,  toluene, ethylbenzene) by means of this 
system, which proved to be more efficient that  the treatment of each oxidant alone or in 
binary combinations. Mokrini et al., (1997) presented the de gradation of phenol by means 
of this process at different pHs, establishing the optimal H 2O2 amount. A 40% of TOC 
reduction was achieved by this method. Trapido et  al., (2001) reported the combination of 
ozone with UV radiation, and hydrogen peroxide was found to be more effective for the 
degradation of nitrophenols than single ozona tion or the binary combinations, increasing 
the reaction rate and decreasing the ozone c onsumption when using low pH values. With 
regard to NB and DCP, no articles have been  found in the literature about the oxidation of 
these compounds by means of this process.

Abstract 
 
The feasibility of employing different photoxidation systems, like Fenton/UV-C and 
ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light in the decolorization a nd mineralization of an azo dye, has 
been investigated. Batch experiments were carried out to evaluate, on the first stage, the influence of different processes on Reactive Black 5  (RB5) decolouriza tion. During the 
second stage were investigated the optimal  operational conditions of Fenton/UV-C and 
ferrioxalate/H
2O2/solar light processes, like pH, H 2O2 dosage, iron dosage, RB5 
concentration and source of light. The experi ments indicate that RB5 can be effectively 
decolorized using Fenton /UV-C and ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light processes with a small 
difference between the two processes, 98.1 and 93.2%, respectively, after 30 minutes. 
Although there is lesser difference in dye d ecolourization, significan t increment in TOC 
removal was found with Fenton/UV-C pro cess (46.4% TOC removal) relative to 
ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light process (29.6% TOC rem oval). This fact reveals that UV-C 
low pressure mercury lamp although with it s small effect on dye decolorization is 
particularly important in dye mineralizati on, when compared to solar light. However, 
ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light system shows large poten tial on photochemical treatment of 
textile wastewater with particular inte rest from the economical point of view.

 Chapter 2 - Degradation of Reactive Bl ack 5 by Fenton/UV-C and ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light processes  
 40 2.1 Introduction 
 
Textile industry is one of the highest wa ter consuming sectors, between 25 and 250 
m3 per ton of product depending on the processe s - and the largest c onsumer of colorants 
for various dyeing, printing and finishing processes [1,2]. This  water consumption, allied 
to high dosages of dyes, originates effluents that are extremely colorized. The release of 
these wastewaters to natural environments is described as very problematic to aquatic life 
[3] and mutagenic to human [4]. 
The conventional treatment techniques appl ied in textile wastewaters, such as 
chemical coagulation/flocculation, membrane separation (ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis) 
or elimination by activated carbon adsorption, ar e not only costly, but also result in phase 
transfer of pollutants. Biological treatment is not an efficient solution to these effluents due 
to the complex structure of some dyes that provokes resistances to biodegradation. Hence, 
the resource to Advanced Oxidation Processe s (AOPs) could be a good alternative to treat 
and remove textile dyes from the wastewaters.  
The azo dyes, characterized by an azo gr oup (-N=N-), are the la rgest class of dyes 
used in textile industry for dyeing several na tural and synthetic materials [1,5]. Between 
the several azo dyes (acid, reactive, disperse, vat, meta l complex, mordant, direct, basic 
and sulphur) the most used are the “reactive”  type. These dyes are the most problematic 
pollutants of textile wastewater s. This fact occurs because, after the dyeing process, more 
than 15% of the textile dyes are lost in wastew ater stream [6]. Theref ore, in this study was 
selected the azo dye Reactive  Black 5  (RB5) as a representative dye pollutant of textile 
wastewaters. 
Advanced Oxidation Processes offers a highly reactive, non-specific oxidant, 
namely hydroxyl radicals (HO•), capable of destroying a wide  range of organic pollutants 
in water and wastewater [ 7,8]. Fenton's reagent oxidation is a homogeneous catalytic 
oxidation process using a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and ferrous ions. In an acid 
environment if hydrogen peroxide is added to  an aqueous system containing an organic 
substrate and ferrous ions, a complex redox r eaction will occur [9-11]. The overall reaction 
is: 
 
H2O2  +  Fe2+  →  Fe3+  +  HO-  +  HO•    (2.1) 
 Chapter 2 - Degradation of Reactive Bl ack 5 by Fenton/UV-C and ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light processes 
 41The ferrous ion initiates and cat alyses the decomposition of H 2O2, resulting in the 
generation of hydroxyl radicals, HO• [12-13]. Hydroxyl radicals  are capable of rapidly 
attacking organic substrates and causing ch emical decomposition of these compounds by 
H-abstraction and addition to  C=C unsatured bonds [14]. 
The addition of UV radiation to Fenton’s reagent process could be an interesting 
allied in dye decolorization due to its capac ity in influencing direct formation of HO• 
radicals [15,16]. This AOP combination has ga ined progressive atten tion in recent years 
due to its higher efficiency when compared to  the dark process. In Fenton/UV-C process, 
in addition to Eq. 2.1, the formation of hydr oxyl radical also occurs by the following 
reactions (Eq. 2.2 and 2.3): 
 
H2O2  +  UV  →  HO•  +  HO•      (2.2) 
Fe3+  +  H 2O  + UV  →  HO•  +  Fe2+  +  H+    (2.3) 
 
Recently, other processes have been studied trying to use solar light instead of 
artificial UV radiation. Ferrioxalate,  used for decades as a chemical actinometer, has been 
applied in the Fenton’s reagent process as ir on source thus allowing further benefit from 
solar radiation [17]. The use of  ferrioxalate in the degradat ion of organic pollutants was 
reported to be very effective, and using sola r light was found to be an economic alternative 
when compared to artificial UV radiation [18- 20]. The photolysis of ferrioxalate generates 
Fe(II) in acid solutions reported as follows [18,21]: 
 
[Fe(C 2O4)3]3-  +  hν    →  Fe2+  +  2C 2O42-  +  C 2O4-• (2.4) 
C2O4-•  +  [Fe(C 2O4)3]3-  →  Fe2+  +  3C 2O42-  +  2CO 2 (2.5) 
C2O4-•  +  O 2  →  O2-•  +  2CO 2    (2.6) 
 
The main objective of this study is to an alyse the feasibility of decolorization and 
mineralization of RB5 by Fe nton/UV-C and ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light processes. The 
influence of different operational parameters  (source and intensity of light, pH and H 2O2, 
iron and RB5 concentration) that aff ect the efficiency of Fenton/UV-C and 
ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light processes during the oxidation of Reactive Black 5  are 
studied. Chapter 2 - Degradation of Reactive Bl ack 5 by Fenton/UV-C and ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light processes  
 42 2.2 Experimental 
2.2.1 Material 
 
The azo dye, Reactive Black 5  (Color Index 20505), was kindly provided by DyStar 
Anilinas Têxteis Lda . (Portugal) and used as received  without further purification. UV-vis 
absorption spectra and molecular structure of  RB5 in non-hydrolyzed form are illustrated 
in Figure 2.1. The chemicals used in the experiments, FeCl 3 (Riedel-de-Haën ), C 2H2O4 
(Fluka ), FeSO 4.7H 2O (Panreac ), H 2O2 (Merck , Perhydrol, 30%  w/w) and Na 2SO 3 (M&B ) 
were of reagent grade. All the solutions were  prepared by dissolving requisite quantity of 
dye in deionised water from a Millipore  purification system. When  appropriate, the pH of 
the solution was adjusted using H 2SO 4 and NaOH solutions. Initial pH of solution was 
monitored using a Basic pH Meter from Denver Instrument Company .

2.2.2 Photoreactor 
 
Batch experiments for Fenton/UV-C oxidation, were performed in a Heraeus  
photoreactor. The cylindrical reactor of 800 mL  capacity was made of borosilicate glass 
with ports, at the top, for sampling. For Fe nton/UV-C oxidation was used a low-pressure 
mercury vapor lamp, Heraeus  TNN 15/32 , placed in axial position inside the reactor. The 
reaction temperature was kept at the de sired value within ± 0.5 ºC by using a 
thermostatically controlled outer water jacket . For every experiment performed, the reactor 200 300 400 500 600 700 800012345

 43was initially loaded with 500 mL of RB5 aqueous solution and continuous mixing was 
maintained by means of a magnetic stirrer. Ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light experiments were 
carried out, in open air, at the University  of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro campus, 
Portugal (41º18’N; 7º45’W) under clear sky conditions. All photocatalytic experiments 
were carried out under similar conditions on sunny days of May – August, between 11 AM and 3 PM. Solar reactions were conducted in a glass reactor wrapped externally with 
aluminium foil to avoid lateral penetration of  irradiation through the sidewalls. During the 
experiments solar light inte nsity was measured at 5-minutes intervals using a Macam Q102 
PAR Radiometer (400-1000 nm). The measurements were standardized in the way that the 
sensor was always set in th e horizontal position. The aver age light intens ity over the 
duration of each experiment was calculated.  
2.2.3 Analysis  
 
For Fenton/UV-C process a de sired quantity of dye/Fe
2+/H2O2 solution was freshly 
prepared from FeSO 4.7H 2O, H 2O2 and the dye stock solution. Most of the experiments 
were carried out at pH=5 of the solution. The required amount of Fe2+ was added into the 
dye solution. In ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light process th e required amounts of Fe3+ and 
oxalic acid were added simultaneously into  the dye solution and mixed by means of a 
magnetic stirrer. Finally, in both processes, the de sired volume of H 2O2 was injected into 
the solution. In Fenton/UV-C process the reaction time was recorded when the UV lamp was turned on, and in ferrioxalate/H
2O2/solar light process when  the solution was exposed 
to solar irradiation. Samples of dye soluti on were withdrawn during the course of the 
reaction, at periodic intervals, and analysed in a UV-vis scanning spectrum, 200-800 nm, 
using a Jasco V-530  UV/vis (Tokyo, Japan) double-beam spectrophotometer. Na 2SO 3 
solution was used to quench oxidation in samp les before the spectrophotometric analysis.  
The color of dye solution in the reaction mixture was obtained by the measure of 
the absorbance at maximum wavelength ( λmax = 595 nm) and computing the concentration 
from calibration curve. Total Organic Carbon (T OC) measurements were  carried out with a 
Skalar Formacs TOC/TN analyser. 
  Chapter 2 - Degradation of Reactive Bl ack 5 by Fenton/UV-C and ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light processes  
 44 2.3 Results and Discussion 
 
Absorption spectra of the dye solutions were r ecorded. The concentration of residual dye in 
solution was calculated by Beer-Lambert law using the optical density and the molar extinction observed at the characteristic wavelength ( λ
max = 595 nm): 
 
A = lεC      (2.7) 
 
where A is the absorbance, l, the path length (cm), ε, the molar extinction coefficient  
(Lmol-1cm-1), and C, the dye concentration at time t (mol/L). Dye decolorization was 
calculated as follows: 
 
Dye decolorization = (1 - C dye,t /Cdye,0) x 100% (2.8) 
 
where C dye,t and C dye,0 are the concentrations of dye at reaction time t and 0, respectively. 
 
2.3.1 Photochemical decolorization of Reactive Black 5 
 
Initially, the photochemical degradability of the dye RB5 was carried out with 
Fenton/UV-C and ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light process to compare the decolorization 
capacity of each one. From Figure 2.2 it is possible to verify that the decolorization of RB5 
solutions was efficiently induced by both processes.

Solar light intensity average = 530 Wm-2; UV lamp = TNN 15/32 Heraeus ; Reaction time = 60 
min.  
However, Fenton/UV-C pro cess has a better decolori zation capacity than 
ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light process. Although from the result s it is not possible to 
evaluate, for example, whether the higher deco lorization of Fenton/UV-C process is due to 
the source of iron or from the source of light. Therefore, to analyse the influence of each 
parameter on dye decolorization several experi ments were carried out that permits to 
evaluate the employment of UV-C radiation, solar light and differe nt sources of iron 
(ferrous and ferrioxalate). In Table 2.1 are represented the re sults of that experiments. 
Through this it is possible to observe that for a RB5 concentration of 1.0x10-4 mol/L, at pH 
5, and with a solar light intensity average of 530 Wm-2, the dye decolorization is null after 
60 minutes for the following processes:  (1) RB5 + solar light; (3) RB5 + Fe2+ + solar light; 
(7) RB5 + H 2O2 + solar light and (11)  RB5 + ferrioxalate + H 2O2 + dark. In the process (2) 
RB5 + UV-C was observed a small dye decolo rization of about 11.4% in 30 minutes. In 
process (7), where could be expected a si gnificant decolorization due to the use of a 
powerful oxidant - hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2 = 1.78 V), the RB5 decolorization does not 
happen. This result reveals th at RB5 azo dye has a comple x and resistant molecular 
structure (Figure 2.1). Ther efore, decolorization of Reactive Black 5  could be primarily 
attributed to the hydroxyl radicals , with a higher redox potential (HO• = 2.80 V), generated 
from Fenton/UV-C and ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light processes. 
Comparing processes (1) and (2) results re veal a better RB5 decolorization capacity 
of the UV-C radiation than solar light. The addition of Fe2+ to the UV-C radiation (process 
4) promotes an increase in dye decolorizati on, compared to process 2, achieving the value 
of 25.4%. However, the addition of Fe2+ to process (3) RB5 + so lar light does not effect 
positively to the dye decolorization.       Chapter 2 - Degradation of Reactive Bl ack 5 by Fenton/UV-C and ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light processes

 Chapter 2 - Degradation of Reactive Bl ack 5 by Fenton/UV-C and ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light processes 
 47By adding H 2O2 to the processes (3) and (4) (processes (9) RB5 + Fe2+ + H 2O2 + 
solar light and (10) RB5 + Fe2+ + H 2O2 + UV-C) it is visible th at decolorization capacity 
increases significantly for both processes,  achieving a very similar decolorization 
percentage of 97.5% and 98.1%, resp ectively. Process (8) RB5 + Fe2+ + H 2O2 + dark 
shows a decolorization of 97.4%. With a ferrioxalate iron source  (processes (5) and (6)) the 
UV-C radiation for a time reaction of 30 min, have a higher decolori zation capacity than 
solar light (53.5% and 16.4%, respectively). By  comparing processes (11) (dark, 0 %) and 
(12) (solar light, 93.2%), it is  patent that light is absolu tely necessary for processes 
involving ferrioxalate. Processes (12) and (13)  present a decolorizat ion capacity of 93.2 
and 98.7%, respectively, evidenci ng that artificial UV-C light l eads to a better performance 
than solar light. 
The higher efficiency of processes (10) RB5 + Fe2+ + H 2O2 + UV-C and (13) RB5 
+ ferrioxalate + H 2O2 + UV-C, achieving a decolorizat ion of 98.1% and 98.7%, signifies 
that the combination between UV-C lamp, ferrous ions and ferrioxalate has a sensible increase on dye decolorization when compared  to the experiments with solar light.  
 
2.3.2 Kinetic analysis of ferrioxalate processes 
 
For a better knowledge of decolorization processes with ferri oxalate were also 
evaluated the reaction kinetics and the half-life time ( t
1/2). As show in Table 2.2 the 
disappearance of dye during the first 30 min of  oxidation could be de scribed as a first-
order reaction kinetics with regard to dye c oncentration. Initial decolorization rate 
constants were determined from the slope of -ln(C/C 0) vs t (min) plots, where C0 and C are 
dye concentrations at time zero and t, respectively.  
 
      Table 2.2  – First order rate kinetics ( k) and half-life (t 1/2) of dye decolorization. 
Oxidation Processes k (min-1) t1/2 (min) 
  5. RB5 + ferrioxalate + solar light  0.0044 --- 
  6. RB5 + ferrioxalate + UV-C  0.0264 27.2 
11. RB5 + ferrioxalate + H 2O2 + dark --- --- 
12. RB5 + ferrioxalate + H 2O2 + solar light  0.0772 5.4

 48 As it can be seen in Table 2.1 and comparing k values and t1/2 in Table 2.2 it 
follows that process (13) RB5 + ferrioxalate + H 2O2 + UV-C process, when compared to 
process (12) RB5 + ferrioxalate + H 2O2 + solar light, presents an improved decolorization 
capacity. This fact is due to the little effect of solar light radiation as can be seen for the 
small k value process (5) RB5 + ferr ioxalate + solar light. In pr ocess (6) RB5 + ferrioxalate 
+ UV-C, although there is little power of the low-pressure mercury vapor lamp TNN 
15/32, the k value is six times higher than that obtained in the process (5). This result 
permits defined as more efficient, with th ese experimental condi tions, the (13) RB5 + 
ferrioxalate + H 2O2 + UV-C process. However, to have a complete knowledge of optimal 
conditions the next steps of this work are to  assess the capacity of each principal process 
(Fenton/UV-C and ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light) that oxidizes the Reactive Black 5  azo 
dye.  
2.3.3 Effect of pH 
 
The effect of pH on the RB5 decolo rization by processes (10) RB5 + Fe
2+ + H 2O2 + 
UV-C and (12) RB5 + ferrioxalate + H 2O2 + solar light is shown in Figure 2.3. This figure 
shows that pH significantly influences th e conversion of RB5 in both processes. The 
experiments were carried out at pH between 1 and 8. At low pH (1 and 2) was obtained a 
very low decolorization in both processes. In the Fenton/UV-C process the decolorization 
percentage, for a reaction time of 30 min, was 32% and 46% for pH 1 and 2, respectively. 
For ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light process the decolori zation was minor than Fenton/UV-C 
process at this pH, achieving a decolorization of 2% for pH  1 and 39% for pH 2. The low 
decolorization at pH 1 and 2 is probably due to the hydroxyl radi cal scavenging by the H+ 
ions (Eq. 2.9) [16].  
HO
•  +  H+  + e-  →  H2O   (2.9) 
 
By increasing the pH for 3 was obtained the highest decolorization for Fenton/UV-
C, 98.6%. For pH above 3 the Fenton/UV-C pro cess decolorization capac ity is very similar 
to that for pH 3, achieving a color remo val of about 98% for all pH. In the 
ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light process for pH 3 a colo r removal of 69% was achieved, with 
increasing the decolorization capacity until the pH 5, the highest value for this process Chapter 2 - Degradation of Reactive Bl ack 5 by Fenton/UV-C and ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light processes 
 49being 90%. For pH abov e 5 the color removal capacity decr eases until the value of 72% for 
pH 8. This behavior could be explained by the formation of ferric hydroxo complexes 
during the reaction, which bloc ks the decomposition of hydroge n peroxide catalyzed by the 
ferrous iron [22].

2.3.4 Effect of H 2O2 dosage 
 
Figure 2.4a and b shows the relationship between degradation of dye and initial 
dosage of H 2O2 in the Fenton/UV-C and ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light processes. The 
objective of this evaluation is to sele ct the best operati onal dosage of H 2O2 in both 
processes. In Fenton/UV-C process, the addition of H 2O2 between 0.5x10-3 and 2.0x10-3 
mol/L increases the decolorization from 86%  to 99%, respectively, at 20 minutes. For 
ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light process is achieved a RB5 decolorization of 78% to a H 2O2 
dosage of 1.5x10-3 mol/L. However, increasing the peroxide dosage to 2.0x10-3 mol/L, dye 
decolorization decreases to 73 %, also for a reaction time of 20 minutes. This decrease is 
probably due to the scavenging of HO• radicals by the H 2O2, which can be expressed by 
Equations 2.10 and 2.11 [23,24]:

Although for a reaction time of 60 minutes the decolorization percentage achieved 
for Fenton/UV-C and ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light processes are similar to all peroxide 
dosages. The difference between the two processe s, for the same peroxide dosage, is minor 
for a reaction time of 60 minutes than for 20 minutes. Ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light process 
increases its decolorization capacity with time, revealing that reaction time is very 
important in RB5 decolorization. For a RB5 concentration of 1.0x10-4 mol/L, 1.5x10-3 
mol/L of H 2O2 could be defined as the optimum dosage. 
 
2.3.5 Effect of iron dosage 
 
The effect of adding iron on RB5 decolori zation has been studied. The results are 
shown in Figure 2.5a and b. The amount of ir on is one of the main parameters that 
influence the Fenton/UV-C and ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light processes. The results indicate 
that the extent of decolorization increase s with a higher initia l iron concentration. 
In Fenton/UV-C process addition of Fe2+ from 0.5x10-4 to 2.0x10-4 mol/L increases 
color removal from 89% to 96% for a reactio n time of 20 minutes. From results it is 
possible say that efficiency of RB5 dest ruction increases with a higher initial Fe2+ 
concentration. Although, by increa sing the iron dosage from 1.5x10-4 to 2.0x10-4 mol/L 
only a small decrease in decolori zation is verified. It may be explained by redox reactions 
that HO• radicals may be scavenged either by th e reaction with hydroge n peroxide present 
or with another Fe2+ molecule as mentioned below (Eqs. 2.12 and 2.13) [25].  
 
H2O2  +  HO•  →  H2O  +  HO 2•  (2.12) 
Fe2+  +  HO•  →  HO-  +  Fe3+   (2.13) 
 
In ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light process, to the same reaction time, addition of Fe3+ 
from 0.5x10-4 to 2.0x10-4 mol/L increases color removal from 48% to 79%. The lower 
decolorization capacity at small concentration of iron is probably due to the lowest HO• 
radicals production available for oxidati on. But for a reaction time of 60 minutes a Chapter 2 - Degradation of Reactive Bl ack 5 by Fenton/UV-C and ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light processes  
 52 significant increase in RB5 decolorization is obse rved in both processes. However, in the 
ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light process the enhancement in the decolorization is higher.

 53The decolorization increases, for the same iron dosage, from 79 to 93% for the 
ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light process and from 96 to  99% for Fenton/UV-C process. This 
reveals an important dependence of the ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light process on the 
reaction time. For both processes 1.5x10-4 mol/L of iron can be used as the optimum 
dosage. 
 
2.3.6 Effect of dye concentration 
 
The effect of initial dye concentration on the Fenton/UV-C and 
ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light processes was investigate d, since pollutant concentration is an 
important parameter in wastewater treatment. The influence of the concentration is shown 
in Figure 2.6a and b. From these figures it is possible observe that the extent of degradation 
decreases with the increase in the initial dye concentr ation. The increase of RB5 
concentration from 0.5x10-4 mol/L to 1.5x10-4 mol/L decreases the decolorization from 
99% to 93% for Fenton/UV-C and fr om 98% to 22% for ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light 
process in 20 minutes. A higher concentration increases the number of dye molecules, but 
not the HO• radical concentration, and so the rem oval rate diminishes. In both processes 
the high color of dye concentr ation makes the penetration of  photons difficult, even from 
UV-C and from solar light into dye solu tion, thereby decreasing the hydroxyl radical 
concentration [15]. After 60 minutes  of reaction time the ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light 
process reveals a better performance achieved,  even for the highest RB5 concentration 
studied - an 83% color removal. Chapter 2 - Degradation of Reactive Bl ack 5 by Fenton/UV-C and ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light processes

 552.3.7 Effect of solar light intensity 
 
The solar light intensity changes during th e day and with the climatic conditions. 
Therefore, to evaluate the effect of so lar light intensity in the ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light 
process were performed several experiments at different weather conditions – sunny day 
and cloudy day – at the same hour of the day. From the Figure 2.7 it is visible that RB5 
decolorization is significantly different durin g the first minutes – half an hour – to 
experiments with sunny or cloudy day. In the cl oudy day the decoloriza tion achieved at 30 
minutes is 75 % and in the sunny day for the same reaction time it is 92 %. However for a reaction time of 60 minutes  the decolorization capacity of both experiments is the same – 
93 %. From these results it is possible to conclu de that if the solar light intensity was minor 
a higher retention time in the reactor could be sufficient to find the same color removal.

2.3.8 Mineralization study 
 
It is known that reaction intermediates can  be formed during the oxidation of azo 
dyes and some of them could be long-live d and even more toxic than the parent 
compounds. Therefore, it is necessary understand  the mineralization degree of the azo dye Chapter 2 - Degradation of Reactive Bl ack 5 by Fenton/UV-C and ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light processes  
 56 RB5 to evaluate the degradation level ap plied by Fenton/UV-C and ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar 
light processes. To quantitatively characte rize the mineralization of azo dyes in the 
solution, the TOC removal ratio is used in  the study, which is defined as follows: 
 
TOC removal ratio = (1-TOC t/TOC 0) x 100% 
 
where TOC t and TOC 0 are the TOC values at reaction time t and 0, respectively.

Figure 2.8  – Comparison between decolorization and TOC removal of RB5 after Fenton/UV-C and

1.5x10-3 mol/L; Oxalic acid = 9.0x10-3 mol/L; Iron concentration = 1.5x10-4 mol/L; UV lamp = 
TNN 15/32 Heraeus ; Solar light intensity average = 530 Wm-2; Reaction time = 1 hour; pH = 5. 
 
Figure 2.8 presents the color degradatio n and TOC removal ratio of the azo dye 
RB5 with Fenton/UV-C and ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light processes. As could be seen, dye 
decolorization is much highe r than TOC removal even in  Fenton/UV-C and also in 
ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light processes.  Although, it is visible from this figure that 
Fenton/UV-C process presents a TOC removal higher than ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light 
process, 46.4% and 29.6%, respectively. So, from  this analysis it is evident that neither 
Fenton/UV-C nor ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light has the capacity of eliminate the RB5 dye. 
However, the employment of the UV lamp benefits the azo dye mineralization when 
compared to the solar light. Although from th e economical point of view, the use of solar 
light could be a good alternat ive in dye decolorization.

 572.4 Conclusions 
 
In this work was evaluated the decolori zation and mineralizati on capacity of two 
advanced photochemical processe s: Fenton/UV-C and ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light on  
Reactive Black 5 . From the results the followi ng conclusions can be drawn: 
- Fenton/UV-C and ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light processes,  within of the used 
experimental conditions, lead  to more than 90% of Reactive Black 5  decolorization in half 
an hour. 
- The experiments with RB5 + ferrioxalate follow a first-order kinetic law even 
with UV-C or solar light alone and with hydrogen peroxide additi on. However, when UV-
C lamp + H 2O2 was employed the kinetic rate ( k) was higher comparatively to the solar 
light + H 2O2 combination, achieving, consequently, a minor half-life time ( t1/2). 
- Optimal experimental conditions for both processes, with a RB5 concentration of 
1.0x10-4 mol/L, can be summarized as: pH=5, hydrogen peroxide dosage = 1.5x10-3 mol/L 
and iron dosage = 1.5x10-4 mol/L. 
- The Fenton/UV-C and ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light processes do not only 
decolorize the dye solutions but also partially mineralize the azo dye RB5. 
- Although the very simila r decolorization is noted in both processes, the 
employment of the UV lamp benefits the azo dye degradation. However, from the economical point of view the employment of the natural resource – so lar light – could be 
an interesting option due to its  low cost and the fact of be ing environmentally harmless.

Abstract 
 
This work presents the results of our studi es on the decolorization of aqueous azo dye 
Reactive Black 5 (RB5) solution combining an  Advanced Oxidation Process (Fenton’s 
reagent) followed by an aerobic biological process (mediated by the yeast Candida 
oleophila ). Under our conditions, initi al experiments showed that Fenton’s process alone, 
as well as aerobic treatment by Candida oleophila  alone, exhibited the capacity to 
significantly decolorize azo dye solutions up to 200 mg/L , within about 1 and 24 hours 
respectively. By contrast, neither Fenton’s reagent nor Candida oleophila  sole treatments 
showed acceptable decolorizing abilities for hi gher initial dye concentrations (300 and 500 
mg/L). However, it was verified that Fent on’s reagent process lowered these higher azo 
dye concentrations to a value less than 230 mg/L, which is a pparently compatible with the 
yeast action. Therefore, to decolorize higher concentrations of RB5 and to reduce process 
costs the combination between the two processes was evaluated. The final decolorization obtained with Fenton’s reagent process as primary treatment, at 1.0x10
-3 mol/L H 2O2 and 
1.0x10-4 mol/L Fe2+, and growing yeast cells as a sec ondary treatment, achieves a color 
removal of about 91% for an initi al RB5 concentration of 500 mg/L.

 Chapter 3 – Degradation of a textile reactive azo dye by a combined chemical-biological process: Fenton’s reagent-yeast 
 62 3.1 Introduction 
 
Textile wastewaters are strongly colore d and contain high amounts of organic 
matter depending on forms of dyes and auxili ary chemicals (Meriç and Kaptan, 2004; 
Muruganandham and Swaminathan, 2004). The trad itional treatment te chniques applied in 
textile wastewaters, such as chemical co agulation/flocculation, membrane separation 
(ultrafiltration, reverse osmosi s) or activated carbon adsorp tion only does a phase transfer 
of the pollutant. Moreover, conve ntional biological treatment su ch as activated sludge is 
considered an unsatisfactory solution to these effluents due to the high content of dyestuffs, 
surfactants and additives, which generally ar e organic compounds of complex structures, 
that provokes resistance to biodegradation. 
Among 20-30 different chemical or  chromophore structure dye groups, 
anthraquinone, phthalocyanine, triarylmetha ne and azo dyes are quantitatively the most 
important groups. Azo dyes are synthetic organi c compounds widely used in textile dyeing, 
paper printing and other industrial processe s such as the manufacture of pharmaceutical 
drugs, toys and foods. Within the azo dyes wi de types can by distinguished: acid, reactive, 
disperse, vat, metal complex, mordant, direct, basic and sulphur dyes (van der Zee, 2002).  
The reactive azo dyes are highly recalcitrant  to conventional wastewater treatment 
processes. In fact, as much as 90% of reac tive dyes can remain unaffe cted after activated 
sludge treatment (Pierce, 1994). Therefore, alternative methods should be implemented for effective pollution abatement of dyed effluents. 
Advanced Oxidation Processes offers a highly reactive non-specific oxidant called 
hydroxyl radicals (HO
•), capable of destroying a wide range of organic pollutants in water 
and wastewater (Legrini et al., 1993). Fe nton's reagent is a homogeneous catalytic 
oxidation process using a mixture of hydrogen pe roxide and ferrous i ons, in an acidic 
environment resulting a complex redox r eaction (Lipczynska-Koc hany, 1991; Kuo, 1992; 
Walling, 1998). The ferrous ion initiates and catalyses the decomposition of H 2O2, 
resulting in the generati on of hydroxyl radicals, HO• (Venkatadri and Peters, 1993; Chen 
and Pignatello, 1997).

 Chapter 3 – Degradation of a textile reactive azo dye by a combined chemical-biological process: Fenton’s reagent-yeast 
 63The Fenton’s reagent has the capacity to completely decolorize and partially 
mineralize textile industry dyes in short reaction time, as reported by some studies 
(Neamtu et al., 2001; Kang et al., 2002; Luca s and Peres, 2006). Also its capacity to 
improve organic biodegradability of toxic or non-biodegradable wa stewaters has been 
described (Chamarro et al., 2001). 
The biological treatment of wastewater s containing organic compounds, like azo 
dyes, is not an easy process due to the refractor y character of some of  then. However, since 
1990, several reports have clearly demonstrated  the effectiveness of decolorization and 
mineralization of dyes by white-rot basidi omycetous strains belonging to genera 
Phanerochaete , Bjerkandera , Phlebia , Pleurotus , Pycnoporus  and Trametes  among others 
(Cripps et al., 1990; Fu and Viraraghavan, 200 1; Gill et al., 2002; Selvam et al., 2003; 
Máximo et al., 2003). Fungal tr eatment of dyed effluents removes several chromoforic 
groups and thus decreases its toxicity and esth etic impact in the r eceiving water bodies. 
More recently it was observed that a few ascomycetous yeast species such as Candida 
zeylanoides  (Martins et al., 1999; Ramalho et al., 2002), Candida oleophila  (Lucas et al., 
2006), Candida tropicalis , Debaryomyces polymorphus  (Yang et al., 2003) and 
Issatchenkia occidentalis  (Ramalho et al., 2004) perf orm a putative enzymatic 
biodegradation and concomitant decolorization of azo dyes. However, the difficulties and 
even failures in biological plant operation at high azo dye concentra tions, strongly suggest 
the use of pre-chemical process (Scott and Ollis, 1995). Therefore, the Fenton’s reaction 
was employed in the current work as a pre-trea tment for further aerobic treatment with the 
yeast C. oleophila  of Reactive Black 5. This work is, to  the best of our knowledge, the first 
study that combines Fenton’s reagent, as a pre-treatment, with yeasts as a secondary 
treatment.  
3.2 Experimental 
3.2.1 Reagents and microbiological media 
 
The azo dye, Reactive Black 5 (CI 20505), was kindly provided by DyStar Anilinas 
Texteis Lda  (Portugal) and used without prior pur ification. Molecula r structure and UV-
visible absorption spectra of RB5 was pr eviously illustrated in Figure 2.1. FeSO
4.7H 2O 
was purchased from Panreac, H 2O2 (Perhydrol, 30% w/w) from  Merck and yeast malt 
(YM) agar from Difco. Other chemicals and me dium components were at least analytical Chapter 3 – Degradation of a textile reactive azo dye by a combined chemical-biological process: Fenton’s reagent-yeast 
 64 grade reagents. Solutions were prepared by dissolving dye in deio nised Millipore type 
water accordingly to desired final concentratio ns (w/v). pH was monitored in initial and 
treated samples ( Denver Instrument Company) . 
 
3.2.2 Fenton’s reagent experiments 
 
Batch experiments for Fenton oxidation were performed in a cylindrical 
borosilicate glass reactor of 800 mL capacity, with sampling por ts at the top. The reaction 
temperature was kept at the desired value within ±0.5 ºC  using a thermostatically 
controlled outer water jacket. For every expe riment performed, the reactor was initially 
loaded with 500 mL of RB5 aqueous solution and continuo us mixing was maintained by 
means of a magnetic stirrer. In all e xperiments a necessary  quantity of dye/Fe2+/H2O2 
solution was freshly prepared from FeSO 4.7H 2O, H 2O2 and dye stock solution.  
Experiments were carried out, at an initial pH=5.0 because the non-buffered 
solutions used in used in the Fenton’s reactions suffer a pH decrease during the reaction time to a pH range around 3.0-4.0.  The required amounts of Fe
2+ and H 2O2 were added 
simultaneously into dye solution. Na 2SO 3 solution was used to que nch the Fenton’s reagent 
oxidation.   
3.2.3 Yeast (Candida oleophila) experiments  
 
Batch cultures for biodegradation experiments with C. oleophila  were conducted in 
minimal medium containing (per litre): 5.0 g glucose, 1.0 g (NH
4)2SO 4, 1.0 g KH 2PO 4, 0.5 
g MgSO 4.7H 2O, 0.1 g yeast extract, 0.1 g CaCl 2.2H 2O and different dyestuff amounts (100, 
200, 300, 500 mg/L final concentrations). The mi nimal medium, dyestuff solutions and the 
effluent treated by Fenton’s reagent were auto claved at 121ºC for 15 min, to assure that no 
other microrganism than Candida oleophila  it will be present in the solution. One mL of 
yeast suspension prepared from a recent grow n culture in the same medium without dye 
and aseptically adjusted to an Abs 640 = 1.0 was used to inoculate 250 mL Erlenmeyer 
flasks containing 100 mL of medi um. Incubations were carried out on an orbital shaker set 
at 120 rpm and 26ºC. Abiotic controls (without yeast inoculation) we re always included. 
Samples were periodically collected for determination of color removal. In the combined Chapter 3 – Degradation of a textile reactive azo dye by a combined chemical-biological process: Fenton’s reagent-yeast 
 65experiments - Fenton’s reagent and C andida oleophila  - it was not necessary to adjust the 
pH of the reaction mixture due to the effect of the culture medium added. 
 
3.2.4 Other analytical procedures 
 
Both absorbance readings at visible maxi mum peak (595 nm) and UV-Vis spectrum 
between 200-800 nm were performe d using a Jasco V-530 double-beam 
spectrophotometer. All values and data points  presented are the means of at least three 
independent assays unless otherwise stat ed. The observed standard deviation of 
experimental data was always less than 6% of the reported value. The concentration of 
residual dye in solution was calculated by Beer-Lambert law, after dilution when 
necessary, using the optical de nsity and the molar extinction coefficient observed at the 
characteristic wavelength ( λmax = 595 nm) and expressed as: 
 
Dye decolorization = (1 - C dye,t/Cdye,0) x 100%  [3.2] 
 
where C dye,t and C dye,0 are the concentration of dye at  reaction time t and 0, respectively. 
 
3.3 Results and Discussion 
3.3.1 Reactive Black 5 decoloriza tion with Fenton’s reagent 
 
The Fenton’s reagent decolorization capacity  at different RB5 concentrations was 
evaluated since pollutant concen tration is an important parameter in wastewater treatment. 
The concentrations used in this study we re 100, 200, 300 and 500 mg/L. For this purpose it 
was selected the hydrogen per oxide concentration of 1.5x10–3 mol/L and the ferrous iron 
concentration of 1.5x10-4 mol/L for above-mentioned RB5 concentrations. The initial 
molar ratio between hydrogen peroxide and ferr ous iron was maintained at 10:1 during this 
work in Fenton’s reagent process (Lucas and Peres, 2006). In Figure 3.1 it is possible to observe that the extent of RB5 decoloriza tion decreases with increasing initial dye 
concentrations. For a reaction time of 60 minutes, Fenton’s decolorization capacity 
decreases from 98.0% to 62.6% when dye concen tration varied from 100 and 500 mg/L.  Chapter 3 – Degradation of a textile reactive azo dye by a combined chemical-biological process: Fenton’s reagent-yeast

pH = 5.0. 
 
Under these hydrogen peroxide and ferr ous iron dosages, Fenton’s reagent was 
unable to completely decolorize RB5 solution s at initial concentr ations of 300 and 500 
mg/L. 
 
3.3.2 Reactive Black 5 decoloriza tion with Candida oleophila 
 
Almost full decolorization (95-100%) wa s observed in ba tch cultures of C. 
oleophila  yeast cells containing RB5 up to 200 mg/L  (Figure 3.2). It is worth noting that C. 
oleophila  achieves this performance within 20 -24h in the presence of lower glucose 
concentration (0.5% w/v) and without visible signs of dyestuff adsorption to yeast cells. 
Since higher initial dye concentrations ( 300 and 500 mg/L) exhibited low decolorization 
yields and yeast biomass growth  was not significantly affecte d, an apparent dye inhibition 
should have occurred as previously observed (Lucas et al., 2006). Furthermore yeast cells 
remain colored, a phenomenon not observed w ith batch cultures co ntaining initial dye 
concentrations up to 200 mg/L. Chapter 3 – Degradation of a textile reactive azo dye by a combined chemical-biological process: Fenton’s reagent-yeast

3.3.3 Kinetic analysis 
 
A comparative kinetic study wa s carried out for the chemi cal process with Fenton’s 
reagent and for the biological process with C. oleophila  cells. Initial decolorization rate 
constants ( k) were determined, for both processes, from the slope of -ln(C/C 0) vs t (time) 
plots where C0 and C are dye concentration at time zero and at time t, respectively. It is 
also presented the half-life times ( t1/2), i.e. the time necessary to reduce 50% of initial RB5 
concentration for each process. The half-life times are determined by interpolation from 
experimental data.  
3.3.4 Fenton’s reagent process 
 
In all experiments with Fenton’s reagent the disappearance of dye color during the 
first two minutes of oxidation (Peres et al., 2004), using th e initial-rate method, could be 
described as a first-order r eaction kinetics (Table 3.1).

300 mg/L 0.208 0.991 5.82 
200 mg/L 0.558 0.987 0.52 
100 mg/L 1.225 0.978 0.20 
 
As it can be seen in Figure 3.1 and comparing k values and t1/2 presented in Table 
3.1, Fenton’s process shows a better decolori zation capacity, within these experimental 
conditions, at low RB5 concentr ations. The rate constant ( k) for a RB5 concentration of 
100 mg/L is approximately double in respect to the concentration of 200 mg/L, and 10 
times higher than the RB5 concentra tion of 500 mg/L. The half-life time ( t1/2) is one 
hundred times higher for a con centration of 500 mg/L than to the concentration of 100 
mg/L.  
3.3.5 Candida oleophila process 
 
The aerobic biological  treatment with C. oleophila shows, as expected, minor 
apparent first-order rate cons tants on RB5 decolorization (Table 3.2). On the contrary to 
Fenton’s reagent, that can remove a signifi cant amount of color only in few minutes, 
decolorization in the presence of growing C. oleophila  yeast cells occurs in hours. For this 
biological process, after a lag phase  period of 12 hours, were cal culated the first-order rate 
constants k that are less influenced by initial dye concentration than the chemical process. 
For instance, to an initial dye concentration of 500 mg/L, the k value obtained is only three 
times smaller than at an initi al concentration of 100 mg/L.

3.3.6 Optimization of Reactive Black 5 decolorization by Fenton’s reagent 
 
From the results of Figure 3.1, it is observe d that for RB5 concentrations above 200 
mg/L the Fenton’s reagent is not efficient on decolorization. This happens due to the 
influence of experimental conditions on the ox idation efficiency of Fenton process (Kang 
and Hwang, 2000). Therefore, it was necessary to find the ferrous iron and the hydrogen 
peroxide concentrations that efficiently de colorize high concentrations of RB5. In Figure 
3.3 it is represented the RB5 color removal wi th an initial concentr ation of 500 mg/L to 
evaluate the decolorization capacity of Fe nton’s reagent using different dosage of 
hydrogen peroxide and ferrous iron in a pr oportional molar ratio of 10:1. Between 1.0x10-3 
and 7.0x10-3 mol/L of hydrogen peroxide were app lied to find the optimal oxidant dosage. 
For a hydrogen peroxide concentration of 1.0x10-3 mol/L a RB5 color removal of 54.4% 
was achieved, however, increasing the peroxide dosage until 5.0x10-3 mol/L a higher 
decolorization was reached (93.7%). An increase up to 7.0x10-3 mol/L does not 
significantly improve the deco lorization reaching the valu e of 94.7%. So, trough the 
augment of hydrogen peroxide a nd ferrous iron dosag es it is possible to  decolorize higher 
RB5 concentrations. However, the increase on dye decolorization leads to a more 
expensive treatment cost particularly due  to the enhancement in hydrogen peroxide 
concentration. Therefore, to decrease the operational costs of Fenton’s reagent, its 
combination with other processes must be evaluated. Chapter 3 – Degradation of a textile reactive azo dye by a combined chemical-biological process: Fenton’s reagent-yeast

Experimental conditions: [RB5] = 500 mg/L; Temperature = 20ºC; pH = 5.0. 
 
Analysing these results in ot her perspective, Figure 3.3 pr esents also the remaining 
concentration of Reactive Black 5 after the Fe nton’s reagent. It was verified that for a 
hydrogen peroxide concentration of 1.0x10-3 mol/L the RB5 remaining is about 228 mg/L 
while for a hydrogen peroxi de concentration of 7.0x10-3 mol/L it is about 24 mg/L. From 
these results it should be underlined the f act that the remaining RB5 after a hydrogen 
peroxide concentration of 1.0x10-3 mol/L probably is acceptable for Candida oleophila  
treatment, once the Fenton-treated final efflue nt has a value next to 200 mg/L of RB5. For 
all Fenton-treated final effluent, except for the hydrogen peroxide concentration of 3.0 and 
7.0x10-3 mol/L, it was evaluated the benefit of applying C. oleophila  as secondary 
treatment. 
The next step of this work was the study  of the capacity of combining Fenton’s 
reagent process and the yeast C. olephila  to efficiently decolorize the RB5 dye at a high 
concentration of 500 mg/L.  
3.3.7 Combining Fenton’s reagent and Candida oleophila on RB5 decolorization 
 
The major purpose of this in tegrated process was to reduce the operational costs, 
particularly the hydrogen peroxide concentration used in Fenton’s reagent, to decolorize a Chapter 3 – Degradation of a textile reactive azo dye by a combined chemical-biological process: Fenton’s reagent-yeast 
 71RB5 concentration of 500 mg/L. Th eoretically, experiments with C. oleophila  used as 
primary treatment should be performed. Ho wever, as seen in Figure 3.2, for a RB5 
concentration of 500 mg/L, C. oleophila ’s decolorization capacity  has no significance due 
to the high reaction time and irrelevant deco lorization obtained. Therefore, the study was 
conducted to evaluate the efficiency of Fenton’s reagent as pre-treatment during 60 
minutes, performed at different hydrogen peroxi de dosages. After that , each Fenton-treated 
effluent was inoculated with 1 mL of C. oleophila suspension (Abs 640 = 1.0) to remove the 
remaining concentration of RB5. From Figur e 3.4 it is seen that combining Fenton’s 
reagent and C. oleophila  yeast, a total color removal of 91% and 95% was achieved for an 
initial hydrogen peroxide concentration of 1.0x10-3 and 2.0x10-3 mol/L, respectively.  
Figure 3.4  – Decolorization of a RB5 solution at 500 mg/L with a combined process; a) Fenton’s 
reagent (1 hour shaded portion of the graph); b) Candida oleophila  (7 days). Experimental 
conditions in Fenton’s reagent: (A) = 5.0x10-3 mol/L H 2O2; (B) = 2.0x10-3 mol/L H 2O2; (C) = 
1.0x10-3 mol/L H 2O2. In all experiments molar ratio H 2O2:Fe2+ = 10:1. 
 
At an initial hydrogen per oxide concentration of 5.0x10-3 mol/L, remaining RB5 
after Fenton’s reagent was too low (5%). Desp ite this Fenton-treate d effluent exhibit a 
putative high oxidativ e power, growth of C. oleophila  yeast cells was not inhibited. Since 
optimal hydrogen peroxide concentration coul d be selected and according to operational 
costs, an effective RB5 color removal can be reached combining an AOP (Fenton’s reagent) and aerobic biological treatment ( C. oleophila ). Accordingly with other works 
(Chamarro et al., 2001), this study showed that Fenton’s reagent is an efficient process to

 72 improve organic chemical biodegradability. Moreover, it should be pointed out that 
doubling the initial hydrogen peroxide concentr ation only a minor impact was obtained in 
the final dye decolorization (from 91% to 95 %). Thus, the goal it is not the complete 
decolorization of the azo dye in the chemi cal process, but the generation of a new 
biocompatible effluent.  
3.4 Conclusions 
 
Esthetic and ecological impacts on water bodies  arising from colo red effluents face 
increasingly restrictive polic ies of environmental protecti on around the world. Therefore, 
measures should rapidly be a dopted to stop this environm ental aggression. This work 
presents an alternative option to decolorize dyed textile effluents, through the sequential 
use of an Advanced Oxidation Process (Fenton’s reagent) followed by an aerobic 
biological process (yeast C. oleophila ). Under our experime ntal conditions, a good 
treatment could be purposed as fo llows: Fenton’s reagent using 1.0x10
-3 mol/L H 2O2, 
1.0x10-4 mol/L Fe2+ at 20º C and pH 5.0, as primary tr eatment and then inoculation with 
growing yeast cells as a secondary treatment.  This combined process allows removing 
about 91% of color for an ini tial RB5 concentration of 500 mg /L. It should be pointed out 
that Fenton’s reagent alone requires 5 times more H 2O2 and Fe2+ to achieve an identical 
level of color removal.

Abstract 
 
Winery wastewaters (WW) are characteri zed by their high organic load and by the 
presence of non-biodegradable compounds such as phenolic compounds. This study was undertaken to evaluate the ca pacity of different Advanced  Oxidation Processes (AOP) 
combined with several radiation sources to degrade the phenolic compound Gallic Acid 
(GA). A toxicological assessment was also carried out to evalua te the subproduct’s 
harmful effect generated during the most efficient AOP in the GA photoxidation. Through 
the course of the study it was verified th at the UV radiation lamp TNN 15/32 showed the 
capacity to degrade 34.7% of GA, the UV ra diation lamp TQ 150 achieved a value of 
20.2% and the solar radiation presented on ly a value of 2.3% in 60 minutes. The 
combination of different advanced oxidation processes (Fenton’s reagent, ferrioxalate and 
heterogeneous photocatalysis) were evaluated with the previously studied sources of 
radiation. From the experime nts conducted it was possible to  suggest that the AOP in 
combination with Fe
2+ + H 2O2 + UV TNN 15/32 (photo-Fent on process) was the most 
efficient process thereby achieving the GA de gradation value of 95.6% in 7.5 minutes and 
resulting in a total el imination of toxicity.

 764.1 Introduction   
 
Wine production processes generate differe nt kinds of pollution mostly associated 
with solid wastes and liquid effluents. Wa stewater from the wine-producing, named as 
winery wastewaters, mainly originate from various washing operations during the crushing 
and pressing of grapes, as well as during the rinsing of fermentation tanks, barrels, bottles 
and other equipments or surfaces.[1-4] The volumes and pollution loads significantly vary in 
relation to the working period (vintage, racking, bottling) and to the winemaking 
technologies used (e.g. in the producti on of red, white and special wines).[5] It is estimated 
that a cellar produces around 1.3 - 1.5 kg of re sidues per liter of wine produced, 75% of 
which are winery wastewaters.[6] These wastewaters are charac terized for being rich in 
organic substances (polyphenols, organic acid s, sugars), high COD values (3-30 g O 2/L), 
and a remarkable recalcitrant character due  to the presence of phenolic compounds. 
Various natural phenols and th eir condensation products, such as tannins or lignins, are 
present in several types of agro-industria l wastes. Gallic acid is a common polyphenol 
present in several agro-wastewaters, like o live oil factories, boiling cork and wine 
processing industries, and can be also considered  as one of the simplest models of natural 
organic matter.[7,8] 
Several physical and chemical processes are available to winery wastewater 
treatment but its major action is a phase transf er of pollutants. Biol ogical waste treatment 
methods have been recognized as a possi ble way for a signifi cant degradation of 
wastewater with high organic content, such as  those coming from wineries in particular. 
However, the presence of toxic compounds for the microorganisms together with the high 
operational costs and large quantities of wa ste sludge generated reduces the treatment 
usability.[7,9] 
Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOP) offer a highly reactive, non-specific oxidant, 
namely hydroxyl radicals (HO•), capable of destroying a wide  range of organic pollutants 
in water and wastewater.[10-13] Fenton's reagent oxidation is  a homogeneous catalytic AOP 
using a mixture of ferrous salts and hydrogen peroxide.[14-16] The overall reaction is: 
 
Fe2+  +  H 2O2  →  Fe3+  +  HO-  +  HO•   (4.1) 
 Chapter 4 – Gallic acid photochemical oxidati on as a model compound of winery wastewater 
 77The ferrous ion initiates and cat alyses the decomposition of H 2O2, resulting in the 
generation of hydroxyl radicals, HO•.[17,18] Adding UV radiation to Fenton’s reagent 
process, creating a photo-Fenton pr ocess, could be an interes ting allied in the wastewater 
treatment due to its capacity in influencing direct formation of HO• radicals.[19-21] In  
photo-Fenton process, in additi on to the Equation 1, the forma tion of hydroxyl radical also 
occurs by the following reacti ons (Equations 4.2 and 4.3): 
 
H2O2  +  UV  →  HO•  +  HO•      (4.2) 
Fe3+  +  H 2O  +  UV  →  Fe2+  +  HO•  +  H+    (4.3) 
 
Ferrioxalate,  used for decades as a chemical actinometer, has also been applied in 
the Fenton’s reagent process as iron source allo wing further benefit mediated by ultraviolet 
radiation.[22] The photolysis of ferrioxalate generates Fe2+ in acidic solution reported as 
following:[23-26] 
 
[Fe(C 2O4)3]3-  +  hν  →  Fe2+  +  2C 2O42-  +  C 2O4-•   (4.4)

Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a technology based on the irradiation of a catalyst, 
usually a semiconductor (e.g. TiO 2), which can be photoexcited to form electron-donor 
sites (reducing sites) and elect ron-acceptor sites (oxidising sites), providing great scope as 
redox agents. In the interfacial region between the excited solid partic le and the solution, 
destruction or removal of contaminants ta kes place, with no chemical change in the 
catalyst.  
Hence, the main objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of Advanced 
Oxidation Processes, specifically the proc esses Fenton’s reagent, ferrioxalate and 
heterogeneous photocatalysis (TiO 2) combined with different UV radiation sources, in the 
degradation of one of the mo st representative phenolic compounds present in the winery 
wastewaters: gallic acid. Fina lly, a toxicological assessment carried out with the marine 
bacteria Vibrio fischeri  was also realized to evaluate th e influence of each AOP studied in 
the gallic acid detoxification. Chapter 4 – Gallic acid photochemical oxidati on as a model compound of winery wastewater

applied as reagent grade. All the solutions we re daily prepared in ultra-pure water from a 
Millipore purification system. The pH of the solution was monitored using a Basic pH 
Meter from Denver Instrument Company. In  the experiments with heterogeneous 
photocatalysis the TiO 2 was separated by centrifugati on and filtration (through 0.2 μm 
membrane filters) before analysis of gallic acid.  
 
4.2.2 Experiments and analysis 
 
Batch experiments with solar radiation were realized at the campus of UTAD - 
University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro (41º18' N; 7º45' W) in days of clear sky, 
between May and August (11 AM and 3 PM), in a 1000 mL reactor. The solar radiation 
intensity was monitored in intervals of 5 minutes using a radiometer Macam Q102 PAR (400-1000 nm). The average light intensity ov er the duration of each experiment was 
calculated.  OHOHO HCOOHChapter 4 – Gallic acid photochemical oxidati on as a model compound of winery wastewater 
 79In the processes with ultraviolet lamp s as source of radiation, a UV Heraeus 
photoreactor was used equipped with a low- pressure mercury vapor  lamp (Heraeus TNN 
15/32); and the other UV experiments were conducted with a medium-pressure mercury 
lamp (Heraeus TQ 150). The concentration of hydrogen peroxide was measured by the 
iodometric method. Hydrogen pero xide present in the samples from the AOP experiment 
was removed using catalase (2500 U/mg; 100 mg/L) acquired from Sigma. Experiments were conducted in the absence of any buffer solution. 
Samples of gallic acid solution were wit hdrawn during the course  of the reaction, at 
periodic intervals, and analyzed by hi gh performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 
carried out on a Gilson system (two pumps,  dynamic mixer and UV/VIS detector) fitted 
with a column EC Nucleosil 120-5 C
18 (Macherey-Nagel). The HPLC analysis was 
performed in a gradient mode with two solutions, solution A: water, methanol, acetic acid 
(88:10:2 v/v) and solution B: water, methanol  (70:30 v/v). The elution flow rate was  
1 mL/min and the injection volume was 20 μL in all samples. Detection of gallic acid was 
done at 260 nm with a retention time of 5.8 minutes. 
Toxicity assessment was performed us ing a commercial assay marketed: the 
luminometer Aboatox 1253 and the Biotox kit. The biological agent is a freeze-dried 
preparation of the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri  (formerly known as Photobacterium 
phosphoreum , NRRL number B-11177). To monitor the inhibition of the bacterial 
luminescence, different samples of gallic ac id, made with a specially prepared non-toxic 
2% sodium chloride solution, were mixed with  the bacterial suspension, to provide optimal 
living conditions for the marine test organi sm. The light emission was measured after a 
contact period of 15 min at 15  ºC. Hydrogen peroxide presen t in the samples was removed 
prior to toxicity analysis using catalase (2500 U/mg; 100 mg/L). All the samples were 
analysed after adjusting the pH to 7. Careful control of temperature was essential because 
light emission is sensitive to temperature. For example, for P. phosphoreum  the light 
intensity changes about 10% for every ºC variation in  temperature. The in hibition effect of 
the samples was compared with a toxicant-free control to obtain the percent of inhibition 
(INH %) determined as described in the following formula:  
% INH = {1- (T
15/T0)/(C 15/C0)} x 100  (4.7) 
 Chapter 4 – Gallic acid photochemical oxidati on as a model compound of winery wastewater 
 
 80where T 0 = light in sample vial at 0 minutes; T 15 = light in sample vial at 15 minutes; C 0 = 
light in control vial at 0 minutes and C 15 = light in control vial  at 15 minutes. All the 
experiments were carried out in dupli cate and average valu es are presented. 
 
4.2.3 TiO 2 characterization 
 
Titanium dioxide (TiO 2 Degussa P25) was charac terized by X-ray diffraction 
(XRD) in order to have a be tter knowledge of the material  used in this study. XRD 
measurements were performed at room te mperature with a PW 3040/60 X’Pert Pro 
diffractometer system, using CuK α radiation ( λ = 1.54 A°) and Bragg-Bentano θ/2θ 
geometry. The system includes the ultra-fa st X’Celerator det ector PW3015/20 and a 
secondary monochromator. The measur ements were performed over the 2 θ range of 10-
100º. An acquisition step of 0.017º  was used with an acquisition time of 100 s/step. Phase 
quantification and particle size determination were performed using Rietveld refinement’s 
PowderCell 2.4 software[27]. It is verified that the TiO 2 used shows, in volume, 87% of 
anatase and 13% of rutile phase with a pa rticle size 40 nm and 70 nm, respectively.  
 
4.3 Results and discussion 
4.3.1 Gallic acid photoxidation 
 
The present study aimed to evaluate th e capacity of different AOP in the 
degradation of the gallic acid. The action of each process was increased using different 
sources of radiation - solar light and ultr aviolet radiation (Heraeus UV lamps 15/32 TNN 
and TQ 150). Figure 4.1 shows the individual performances of the different sources of 
radiation in the decrease of gallic acid concen tration as a function of irradiation time. It is 
possible to verify that, after 60 minutes of  irradiation, the UV lamp TNN 15/32 shows the 
capacity to degrade 34.7% of gallic acid, a supe rior value in relation to the UV lamp TQ 
150 (20.2%) and highly superior one to the solar radiati on (2.3%). This different 
degradation capacity of the studied phenolic compound can be  justified by the different 
characteristics of each source of radiati on. The UV lamp 15/32 is classified as a 
monochromatic lamp and the UV lamp TQ 150 as a polychromatic lamp. Chapter 4 – Gallic acid photochemical oxidati on as a model compound of winery wastewater

5.3x10-4 mol/L; Solar intensity (sunny day) = 545 Wm-2; Initial pH 4.0. 
 
Therefore, it can be stated that the gallic acid photodegr adation is more efficiently 
achieved with the UV lamp TNN 15/32 since th e main emission wavelength of this lamp 
(253.7 nm) is very close to the main absorpti on wavelength of the phenolic acid (260 nm). 
On the other side, the UV lamp TQ 150 presents  large emission spectra from the ultraviolet 
to the infrared wavelengths, being minor th e effect in the gallic acid photodecomposition. 
The gallic acid (GA) oxidat ion values obtained by solar light radiation are almost 
insignificant, comparatively to the action of UV lamps. This probably occurs due to the 
great dispersion/diffusion of th e solar radiation, as well as to the fact that the solar UV 
radiation that really acts in the gallic aci d photodegradation constitutes only a value among 
3.5-8% of the globa l solar radiation.[28] 
The curves of GA concentration versus  reaction time in these photoxidation 
experiments suggest that the decomposition fo llow pseudo-first-order  reaction kinetics. 
Hence, the reaction rate could be determin ed by the integrated first order kinetics 
expression:  
ln [GA]
0/[GA] = kPt   (4.8) 
 Chapter 4 – Gallic acid photochemical oxidati on as a model compound of winery wastewater 
 
 82where [GA] 0 and [GA] represent, respectively, the gallic acid concentration at time 0 and 
time t; and kP the pseudo-first order rate constant. Therefore, according to Equation 4.8, a 
plot of ln [GA] 0/[GA] versus time should provide straig ht lines, and after linear regression 
analysis, the kP values listed in Table 4.2 are deduced.

UV TQ 150 6.57 20.2 3.9 0.987

The determination coefficients are all greater than 0.98 which reinforce the trend 
described above for the decomposition rate w ith the irradiation time. Table 4.2 also 
summarises the conversions obt ained at two selected reac tion times, 15 and 60 min (X 15 
and X 60, respectively). From the presented table it is possible to verify that solar radiation, 
even after 60 minutes of reaction time, does not have significant in fluence on the gallic 
acid photoxidation; as revealed by the kP value (0.40x10-3 min-1). The UV lamps show 
significant changes along the oxidation reacti on. At 15 and 60 minutes the UV lamp TNN 
15/32 and the UV lamp TQ 150 present signif icant oxidation increase, from 6.57 to 20.2% 
and 13.3 to 34.7%, respectively. The va lues of the constant rate kP highlights the high 
oxidation capacity of these two lamps compara tively to the solar radi ation; with special 
attention to the UV lamp TNN 15/32 (7.7x10-3 min-1). 
However, gallic acid photodegradation w ith UV radiation is a slow process and 
must be followed by another AOP.[29] Hence, the work was conducted to combine different 
UV radiation sources with several AOP pro cesses such as hydrogen peroxide, Fenton’s 
reagent, ferrioxalate and hetero geneous photocatalysis with TiO 2. 
 
4.3.2 Influence of H 2O2 on gallic acid photoxidation 
 
Hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) was added to the experiment s presented in Figure 4.1 to 
evaluate the combined action of this str ong oxidant agent (1.78 V) with the different Chapter 4 – Gallic acid photochemical oxidati on as a model compound of winery wastewater 
 83sources of UV radiation. From th e results presented in Figure 4.2 it is possible to see that 
H2O2, de per si , and H 2O2 plus solar radiation, can not si gnificantly oxidis e the phenolic 
compound GA, achieving degradation values of 1.5% and 2.6%, re spectively, after 60 
minutes. However, the combination of hydroge n peroxide with the UV radiation lamps 
TNN 15/32 and TQ 150 highly increases the gallic acid oxidation. The results obtained 
were: to the UV lamp TQ 150 of 42.2% and to the UV lamp TNN 15/32 of 57.0%. These values clearly demonstrate the positive infl uence of this combined system UV + H
2O2 in 
comparison to the single photodegradation process.

Figure 4.2.  Gallic acid degradation in aqueous solution by  different sources of radiation: solar and 
ultraviolet radiation (Heraeus lamps TNN 15/32 and TQ 150) combined with hydrogen peroxide. 
Experimental conditions: [GA] 0 = 5.3x10-4 mol/L; [H 2O2] = 2.7x10-3 mol/L; Solar intensity (sunny 
day) = 545 Wm-2; Initial pH 4.0. 
 
The combination of UV radiation with the H 2O2 promotes the photolysis of this 
oxidant agent generating two hydroxyl radicals (HO•) for each H 2O2 molecule (Equation 
2). The hydroxyl radicals produced show a high  oxidant potential (2.80 V) higher than 
hydrogen peroxide increasing therefore the oxidation power of the UV lamps.[30] The 
global oxidation of the gallic acid results from  the combination of two phases: on the one 
hand the direct photodegradation of the phe nolic compound trough the UV radiation and, 
on the other hand, with the hydroxyl radi cal reaction generate d during the hydrogen 
peroxide photolysis. The results obtained at this  assay are directly related to the obtained in Chapter 4 – Gallic acid photochemical oxidati on as a model compound of winery wastewater 
 
 84the Figure 4.1. The major degr adation capacity of the UV la mp TNN 15/32 also remains 
even when combined with the H 2O2. 
The increased degradation by the co mbination of UV radiation and H 2O2 are 
confirmed through the evaluation of th e pseudo-first order rate constants kT for this process 
presented in Table 4.3. The kT value for Solar Radiation + H 2O2 (0.4x10-3 min-1) is only 
slightly higher comparativel y to that obtained with H 2O2 alone (0.3x10-3 min-1) and equal 
to that achieved for the solar radiation al one. Thus, addition of hydr ogen peroxide can not 
increase the oxidation capacity of the solar ra diation alone. This can  be explained by the 
low capacity of the solar radi ation to promote the photolysis  of the hydrogen peroxide and 
therefore with no generation of hydroxyl radicals.  
In the processes with the UV lamps TQ 150 and TNN 15/32 their combination with 
H2O2 significantly increases the gallic acid  oxidation. Hydrogen peroxide photolysis 
induced by UV lamps is consider ably superior to the solar radiation and di fferent among 
them; achieving kT values of 9.6x10-3 to the UV lamp TQ 150 and 14.5x10-3 to the UV 
lamp TNN 15/32. These results rev eal that gallic acid  decay is improved in relation to the 
single photodegradation by the HO• generated trough the presence of H 2O2. 
Therefore, in this combined phot oxidation, it is po ssible to evaluate th e contribution of the 
two main oxidation effects to the global degrad ation rate. The global reaction rate is the 
accumulation of the rate corresponding to the direct photolysis ( kP) and to the radical 
reaction ( kR). In Table 4.3 are presented the rate constants of the UV/H 2O2 process ( kT) and 
of the radical reaction ( kR).

 Chapter 4 – Gallic acid photochemical oxidati on as a model compound of winery wastewater 
 85The kr value was calculated taking into account that the global photodecomposition rate r T 
can be expressed as the addition of the direct r P and radical r R reaction rates as previously 
reported:[31] 
 
- rT = [- d CGA/dt] = - (r P + r R) = (kP + kR) CGA = kTCGA  (4.9) 
 The rate constants for the radical reaction k
R are deduced through th e subtraction of the 
determined kP from kT. Comparing kP (Table 4.2) and kR (Table 4.3) values it is visible that 
the direct photolysis provides a minor contribu tion to the overall reaction in the experiment 
with the lamp UV TQ 150. However, the contribu tion of direct photolysis is higher than 
the radical reaction in the experi ment with the lamp UV TNN 15/32. 
 
4.3.3 Influence of Fenton’s processes on gallic acid photoxidation 
 
Figure 4.3 presents the results of the assays  of gallic acid de gradation in aqueous 
solution with Fenton’s reagent and its combin ation with several s ources of radiation 
(homogeneous photocatalysis). According to  our results, all photo-Fenton processes 
present a similar degradation capacity which is  superior to the Fent on’s process carried out 
in dark conditions (Equation 4.1 ). Although the small differen ces between the three photo-
Fenton processes (solar, TQ 150 and TNN 15/32 radiations) the experiments w ith the lamp 
TNN 15/32 reveal a high oxidation capacity of  the gallic acid (95.6%) against the 93.8% of 
oxidation obtained in the pres ence of TQ 150 lamp. Dark Fenton’s process presents a 
90.8% of gallic acid degradation.  
In contrast to dark Fenton reaction (w ithout photo-activation), ferrous ion (Fe2+) is 
recycled continuously by irradiation of Fe3+ (Equation 4.3) and therefor e it is not depleted 
during the course of the oxidation reaction. He nce, the production of hydroxyl radicals is 
only limited by the availability of UV/Vis radiation and H 2O2. 
These small differences achieved among all Fenton’s processes can  be explained by 
the dosage of hydrogen pe roxide used: ratio [H 2O2]/[GA]=5:1 and [H 2O2]/[Fe2+]=51:1. The 
relatively low concentrati on of ferrous iron vers us concentration of H 2O2 was used being in 
mind to reduce the iron dosage necessary for the organic compound oxidation; thus 
minimizing the iron sludge formation in the Fenton’s process.  Chapter 4 – Gallic acid photochemical oxidati on as a model compound of winery wastewater

In Figure 4.4 it is presented the GA oxidati on by the ferrioxalate  process (Equations 
4-6). This process is considered  as a Fenton-like process, since it also combines iron and 
hydrogen peroxide. Its degradation capacity wa s studied comparatively to Fenton’s reagent 
with and without radiation. In parallel to th e results observed with Fenton’s process, the 
ferrioxalate process presents similar GA oxida tion capacity, independently of the radiation 
source. In this case the quantum yield of Fe2+ photoproduction can be enhanced by 
photolysis of the highly photosensitive ferri oxalate complex (Equation 4.4). The UV lamp 
TQ 150, UV lamp TNN 15/32 and solar radia tion conducted to a GA degradation of 
87.8%, 89.9% and 91.1%, resp ectively. By contrast in the ab sence of a radiation source, 
ferrioxalate was almost ineffective. The most significant difference among the two 
processes (Fenton’s reagent and ferrioxalate) was achieved in the assay without a radiation 
source. This result reveals th at in the ferrioxalate proc ess the generation of hydroxyl 
radicals, which allow the oxi dation of the phenolic compou nd, is highly dependent on a 
radiation source. Chapter 4 – Gallic acid photochemical oxidati on as a model compound of winery wastewater

Comparing the combination of Fenton’s r eagent and ferrioxalate processes with the 
different sources of radiation, it is possible to verify th at there are not significant 
differences between the two processes. However, solar radiation and the UV lamp TNN 15/32 were defined as the best radiation sources  for both ferrioxalate and Fenton processes, 
respectively. Although the best  choice should be solar ra diation because the energy 
required to treat the same solu tion of gallic acid is only 20%  of the energy amount required 
by the photo-Fenton system in the presence of UV lamps.
[32] 
 
4.3.4 Influence of TiO 2 on gallic acid photoxidation 
 
The gallic acid degradation by TiO 2 (heterogeneous photocatalysis) was also 
evaluated in this study. Figure 4.5 presents the re sults obtained in thes e experiments. It was 
observed that the TiO 2 (Degussa P25) itself can not oxidize the phe nolic compound 
studied, and that after 60 min of contact  time no adsorption process occurs. The 
combination of TiO 2 with the UV lamps presents similar oxidation values (UV TNN 15/32 
- 41.3% and UV TQ 150 - 42.6%) which are roughl y superior to the assays with solar Chapter 4 – Gallic acid photochemical oxidati on as a model compound of winery wastewater 
 
 88radiation (37.2%). Hence, the influence of the UV radiation source observed on the gallic 
acid degradation through the TiO 2 photocatalysis is reduced. 
Later the addition’s effect of H 2O2 to the heterogeneous pho tocatalysis processes is 
presented in Figure 4.6. In contrast to previ ous data (Figure 4.5), the UV lamps combined 
with H 2O2 present significant differences on its  degradation capaci ties (UV TNN 15/32 - 
38.5% and UV TQ 150 - 71.0%).

The combination of H 2O2 with TiO 2 and solar radiation s howed a degradation of 
52.1%. These different degradation capacities can  be justified through the polychromatic 
radiation emitted by the UV lamp  TQ 150 that promotes, at a higher level, the excitement 
of the electrons from the valence band to  the conduction band of the semiconductor (TiO 2), 
in contrast to the monochromatic radiat ion emitted by the UV lamp TNN 15/32 (Equations 
4.10 and 4.11).[33,34]

4.3.5 Toxicity assessment 
 
After the degradation assays  with the different AOP, th e gallic acid detoxification 
level achieved with each oxidation process was evaluated. For that purpose Biotox  test was 
performed, through which the biolumin escence of the marine photobacteria Vibrio fischeri , 
allows the assessment of the gallic acid initial toxicity and the toxicity  of the sub-products 
formed along the AOP reaction. 
Figure 4.7 shows the inhibition percentage of the bacteria Vibrio fischeri  after 15 
minutes of contact with aqueous  solutions of gallic acid withdraw during the treatment 
with three AOP: ferrioxalate + H 2O2 + UV TNN 15/32; Fe2+ + H 2O2 + UV TNN 15/32 and

V. fischeri  showed high sensitivity to the pres ence of gallic acid in  solutions of 100 
mg/L. Analysing the luminescence inhibition of the bacteria Vibrio fischeri  through the 
course of the reaction several oscillations occur, mainly in the first few minutes of AOP 
treatment. This result may be explained through the gallic aci d subproducts generated 
which could present differe nt levels of toxicity to the marine bacteria. 
Among the studied AOP, the photo-Fenton pr ocess using the lamp UV TNN 15/32 
was the only that showed a total capacity to re move the toxicity of gallic acid. The process 
TiO 2 + H 2O2 + UV TNN 15/32 reveals, under our experi mental conditions, no capacity to 
diminish the toxicity of the gallic aci d. After 60 minutes of  reaction with TiO 2, the same 
inhibition level is obtained, with the initia l concentration of the phenolic compound. The 
ferrioxalate + H 2O2 + UV TNN 15/32 process after the first 10 minutes of oxidation, 
removes 42.6% of Vibrio fischeri  luminescence inhibition; although, until the end of 
reaction time (60 min) the toxicity increas es achieving a value equal to the initial 
compound. In sum, only the AOP Fe2+ + H 2O2 + UV TNN 15/32 can effectively reduce the 
harmful effect of the gallic acid.   Chapter 4 – Gallic acid photochemical oxidati on as a model compound of winery wastewater 
 914.4 Conclusions 
 
The photodegradation of the most represen tative phenolic com pound present in the 
winery wastewaters (gallic acid) using only monochromatic and polychromatic UV lamps, 
cannot be achieved in great extension. However, combining radiation with advanced 
oxidation processes, we can maximize the effect  of the different radi ation sources. From 
the present study it is possibl e to conclude that the Fe2+ + H 2O2 + UV TNN 15/32 (photo-
Fenton process) could be pr oposed as the best advanced  oxidation process for the 
degradation of gallic acid in aqueous solutions. Therefore, this work shows a possible treatment to remove or, at least, significantly diminish the problematic  phenolic fraction of 
winery wastewaters, in this case using gallic acid as compo und reference, for biological 
treatment, decreasing their concentration and toxicity. 
Finally, although the less positive results of the AOP with solar radiation, a 
particular attention should be given to these processes due to their special advantages from 
economical and environmental viewpoints as an example of solar application.

Abstract 
 
Degradation of simulated winery wastewat er was studied in a pilot-scale Compound 
Parabolic Collector (CPC) solar reactor. Total organic carbon (TOC) reduction with 
heterogeneous photocatalysis (TiO 2) and homogeneous photocat alysis with photo-Fenton 
was observed. The influence of TiO 2 concentration (200 or 500 mg/L) and also of 
combining TiO 2 with  H2O2 and Na 2S2O8 on heterogeneous photocatalysis was evaluated. 
Heterogeneous photocatalysis with TiO 2, TiO 2/H2O2 and TiO 2/S2O82- is revealed to be 
inefficient in removing TOC, achieving TOC degradation of 10%, 11% and 25%, 
respectively, at best. However, photo-Fenton experiments achieved 46% TOC degradation 
in simulated wastewater prepared with dilute d wine (WV) and 93% in wastewater prepared 
with diluted grape juice (WG), and if ethanol is previously eliminated from mixed wine 
and grape juice wastewater (WW) by air st ripping, it removes 96% of TOC. Furthermore, 
toxicity decreases during the photo-Fenton reac tion very significantly from 48% to 28%. 
At the same time, total polyphenols decrease  92%, improving wastewater biodegradability.

 96 5.1 Introduction   
 
Wine is the product of alcoholic fermenta tion of fresh grapes or of grape must. 
Wastewater from wine production, called winery  wastewater, comes mainly from washing 
operations during grape crushing and pressing, and rinsing of fermentation tanks, barrels, 
bottles and other equipment or surfaces ( 1-3). Discharge and biologi cal treatment of this 
type of effluent is a complex process due to the high concentrati on of organic matter, 
mainly composed of organic acids, ethanol, glucose, fructose and polyphenols with COD 
from 3 000-15 000 mg O 2/L. Furthermore, winery wastewater is seasonal, fluctuating 
widely in volume and composition.  
Several physical and chemical processes are available for winery wastewater 
treatment but the main one used is phase tran sfer of pollutants. Anaerobic treatments have 
been recognized as a possible way to signifi cantly degrade wastewat er with high organic 
content, such as winery effluents ( 4,5). However, the presence of compounds that are 
refractory and even toxic to the microorgani sms along with the larg e quantities of sludge 
generated reduces the treatment’s usability ( 6-8). 
Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) are based on chemical oxidation with 
hydroxyl radicals, which are very  reactive short-lived oxidant s. The radicals are produced 
in an on-site reactor, where they are capab le of destroying a wi de range of organic 
pollutants in water and wastewater ( 9, 10 ). Fenton's reagent oxidation is a homogeneous 
catalytic AOP that combines hydrogen peroxide and ferrous iron, as the catalyst, to oxidize 
contaminants or wastewaters. The overall reaction is: 
 
Fe2+  +  H 2O2  →  Fe3+  +  HO-  +  HO•   (R5.1) 
 
The ferrous ion catalyses and triggers decomposition of H 2O2, resulting in the generation 
of hydroxyl radicals, HO• (11,12 ). Addition of UV radiation to  Fenton’s reagent allied in a 
photo-Fenton process could be of  interest for wastewater trea tment, because it directly 
influences the formation of HO• radicals, (13). In photo-Fenton, in addition to Reaction 1, 
then hydroxyl radicals are also formed thr ough the following reactions  (Reactions 5.2 and 
5.3): 
H2O2  +  UV  →  HO•  +  HO•      (R5.2) 
Fe3+  +  H 2O  +  UV  →  Fe2+  +  HO•  +  H+    (R5.3) Chapter 5 – Solar photochemical treatment of  winery wastewater in a CPC reactor 
 97Heterogeneous photocatalysis is based on irradiation of a catalyst, usually a 
semiconductor (e.g., TiO 2), which can be photoexcited  to form electron-donor sites 
(reducing sites) and electron-acceptor sites (oxi dising sites), providing them with wide 
scope as redox agents. Destruction or removal of  contaminants takes place in the interfacial 
region between the excited solid particle and the solution, with no chemical change in the 
catalyst. Reactions 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6 are the main reactions in heteroge neous photocatalysis 
with TiO 2 (14,15 ): 
 
TiO 2  +  hυ  →  TiO 2 (e- + h+)    (R5.4) 
TiO 2 (e-)  +  O 2  →  TiO 2  +  O 2•-    (R5.5) 
TiO 2 (e-)  +  H 2O2  →  TiO 2  +  HO-  +  HO•  (R5.6) 
 
Winery wastewater treatment by photo-Fe nton and heterogeneous photocatalysis 
has been previously  demonstrated ( 16,17 ). Mosteo et al. ( 18) report that heterogeneous 
photo-Fenton, using natural sunlight as the radiation source, rem oved 50% TOC in 24 
hours, suggesting that this pro cess can be used as a pre-trea tment for an aerobic biological 
process. 
The purpose of this paper is to evaluate  the performance of solar photochemical 
AOPs, such as heterogeneous  photocatalysis (with TiO 2, TiO 2/H2O2 and TiO 2/S2O82-) and 
homogeneous photocatalysis with photo-Fent on, to treat winery wastewater in a 
Compound Parabolic Collector (CPC) pilot-sola r plant. This is, to the best of our 
knowledge, the first study performed with winery wastewater in th is type of solar collector.  
 
5.2 Material and methods 
5.2.1 Winery wastewater 
 
Because of the seasonal character of wine ry wastewater, the effluents had to be 
reproduced with synthetic samples prepared  by diluting commercia l grape juice (WG), 
commercial red wine (WV), and a mixture of both (wine and grape juice - WW) in Milli-
Q® water. WG is simulated wastewater characterized by its high sugar content that 
reproduces winery wastewater during fermenta tion. WV is wastewater with high ethanol 
content that attempts to imitate wastewater generated after fermentation. WW simulates the Chapter 5 – Solar photochemical treatment of  winery wastewater in a CPC reactor 
 
 98 combination of both of the above in a mixtur e similar to the equalization tank in some 
wineries where all the effluents are mixed.  
Table 5.1 shows the main characteristics of  the three types of winery wastewater: 
conductivity, pH, total organic carbon (TOC), chemical oxyge n demand (COD) and total 
polyphenol content.

5.2.2 Chemicals 
 
Heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation was ca rried out using a slurry suspension 
of Degussa (Frankfurt, Germany) P-25 t itanium dioxide (sur face area 51-55 m2/g) and 
sodium persulfate (Na 2S2O8) purchased from Panreac. The photo-Fenton experiments were 
performed using ferrous iron sulphate (FeSO 4.7H 2O), hydrogen peroxide (30% w/w) and 
sulphuric acid for pH adjustment (around 2.8–3.0), all supplied by Panreac.  
The photo-treated solutions were neutralized by mean s of NaOH (reagent grade, 
Panreac) for the toxicity test. Water used in the pilot plant was from the Plataforma Solar 
de Almería (PSA) distillation plant (conductivity < 10 μS/cm, Cl- = 0.7-0.8 mg/L, NO 3- = 
0.5 mg/L, organic carbon < 0.5 mg/L). Other ch emicals used in these experiments were 
reagent grade and used as received.   
5.2.3 Analytical determinations 
 
Organic matter concentration and mineralis ation were monitored by measuring the 
TOC by direct injection of filtered samples into a Shimadzu-5050A TOC analyser, 
equipped with an ASI5000 autosampler, provi ded with an NDIR detector and calibrated 
with standard solutions of potassium phtha late. The COD analysis was determined by Chapter 5 – Solar photochemical treatment of  winery wastewater in a CPC reactor 
 99Merck Spectroquant® cuvette tests. Samples were pr e-filtered through 0.20 µm syringe 
nylon filters (25 mm, Millex® GN, Millipore).  
The COD and TOC are expressed in mg of O 2/L and mg of C/L, respectively. The 
initial hydrogen peroxide concentration wa s always 12 mM and controlled to avoid 
complete disappearance by adding small amounts as consumed. Hydrogen peroxide concentration was determined by the metavanadate method ( 19). Colorimetric 
determination of tota l iron concentration w ith 1,10-phenantroline was used according to 
ISO 6332. Ultra pure distilled-deionised water wa s from a Milli-Q (Millipore Co.) system. 
The polyphenol content was measured in filt ered samples by Folin-Ciocalteau reagent ( 20). 
 
5.2.4 Toxicity measurements 
 
Toxicity was assessed using the Biofix
® Lumi-10 luminometer and the Biofix® 
Lumi kit by Macherey-Nagel. The biological agent is a freeze-dried preparation of the 
marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri  (formerly known as Photobacterium phosphoreum , 
NRRL number B-11177). Light emission was measured at 15ºC after a 15-min contact 
period. Hydrogen peroxide in the samples was re moved prior to the toxi city analysis using 
catalase (2500 U/mg bovine liver; 100 mg/L) from Fluka Chemie AG. All the samples 
were analysed after adjusting the pH to 7. Careful control of temperature was essential 
because light emission is sensitive to temperature. 
 
5.2.5 Experimental set-up 
 
All experiments were carried out under sunl ight, in a pilot plant installed at the 
Plataforma Solar de Almería (latitude 37ºN, longitude 2.4ºW). Phot o-Fenton and titanium 
dioxide experiments were carr ied out in a Compound Parabolic Collector (CPC) pilot-solar 
plant ( 21) able to treat up to 40 L of wastewater (3.1 m2 irradiated surface, 22 L irradiated 
volume).  Chapter 5 – Solar photochemical treatment of  winery wastewater in a CPC reactor

The absorber tube has an internal diameter  of 29.2 mm and an external diameter of

(Figure 5.1) operates in batch mode. The sola r collector is mounted on a fixed platform 
tilted 37º (local latitude). So lar ultraviolet radiation (UV λ<400 nm) was measured by a 
global UV radiometer (KIPP&ZONEN, model CUV 3), mounted on a platform tilted 37º, 
which provides data in terms of incident UV (W/m2). This gives an idea of the energy 
reaching any surface in the same position with regard to the sun. 
With Reaction (5.1), the combination of the data from several days’ experiments and the 
comparison between photo-reactors installed at different emplacements are possible.

(typical solar UV power on a perfectly sunny day around noon). As the system is outdoors 
and is not thermally controlled, the temperatur e inside the reactor is  continuously recorded 
by a PT-100 inserted in the tank. At the begi nning of the process, the collectors were 
covered, the pH was adjusted and the TiO 2 or ferrous iron salt was added. After each 
addition of reagents, the plant was well homog enised by recirculation. Finally, the first Chapter 5 – Solar photochemical treatment of  winery wastewater in a CPC reactor

was taken (time zero) and the collector  was uncovered. The hydrogen peroxide was 
measured frequently and consumed reagent was continuously repla ced to maintain the 
original concentration throughout the reaction.  
 
5.3.Results and Discussions 
5.3.1 Degradation of winery wastewater by TiO 2 
 
Figure 5.2 shows TOC/TOC 0 values during solar photolysis and heterogeneous 
photocatalysis (TiO 2) of the simulated winery wastewat er in the CPC reactor. The results 
reveal that solar photolysis, by itself, produces a very small decrease in TOC in the two studied samples of winery wastewater. However,  in the synthetic sample with high sugar 
content (WG sample) the TOC cont ent decreases slightly faster than in the synthetic WV 
sample.

heterogeneous photocatalysis (TiO 2) in a CPC reactor. Experimental conditions: [TiO 2]0 = 200 
mg/L and 500 mg/L; initial pH = 3.8. 
 
In the experiments performed with  heterogeneous photocatalysis (TiO 2), 
degradation of two types of winery wastew ater (WG or WV) was evaluated with two 
different amounts of catalyst (200 and 500 mg/L). In the experiments with 200 mg/L of TiO
2, TOC decreased 8% in the WV sa mple and 10% in WG after a t 30W of 400 minutes. Chapter 5 – Solar photochemical treatment of  winery wastewater in a CPC reactor 
 
 102 TOC removal from WV was not improved by increasing the amount of catalyst from 
200 mg/L to 500 mg/L, which was again 10%. Thus, TiO 2 alone is insufficient, even when 
the amount of catalyst was more than double d, to remove TOC present in the winery 
wastewater. Therefore, a TiO 2 concentration of 200 mg/L was selected as the best option 
and was used in following experiments.  
5.3.2 Degradation of winery wastewaters by TiO
2/H2O2 and TiO 2/S2O82- 
 
Figure 5.3 shows experiments performed with TiO 2 combined with hydrogen 
peroxide and persulfate to evaluate the improvement in TOC removal generated by the 
addition of these oxidants to TiO 2. No significant changes are observed in the data with 
either of the combinations (TiO 2/H2O2 and TiO 2/S2O82-). With TiO 2/H2O2, TOC removal 
was 11% after a t 30W of 150 minutes, and with a single addition of 10 mM of S 2O82- to 
TiO 2 at the beginning of the e xperiment, TOC degradation wa s 12% in both WV and WG 
samples.

When the concentration of S 2O82- (10 mM) in solution was kept constant throughout the 
reaction in a TiO 2/S2O82- experiment, TOC removal was 25% after a t 30W of 440 minutes. 
Therefore, as a final comment on the heteroge neous photocatalysis experiments, it may be Chapter 5 – Solar photochemical treatment of  winery wastewater in a CPC reactor 
 103confirmed that no significant TOC degradation ca n be achieved with this process in either 
WV or WG even when the amount of TiO 2 is increased or H 2O2 and S 2O82- are added.  The 
effectiveness of photo-Fenton has previously be en demonstrated using different sources of 
radiation and different type s of winery wastewater ( 16,18,22 ). So, the next step in this 
study is to test the effectiveness of photo-Fenton in the treatment of a winery wastewater in 
a CPC reactor.  
 
5.3.3 Degradation of winery wastewat er by photo-Fenton oxidation  
 
Figure 5.4 shows the application of solar pho to-Fenton to treatment of a sample of 
WV, which has a high alcohol content simu lated by a wine dilution. The photo-Fenton 
experiments were done w ith a single dose of Fe2+ (55 mg/L) at pH3. The hydrogen 
peroxide dose of 12 mM was maintained cons tant with successive additions throughout the 
experiment. The solar photo-Fenton experime nts started when the CPC reactor was 
exposed to solar radiation. The results show that after a t 30W of 500 minutes with an added 
H2O2 concentration of 151 mM  TOC removal was 54%.

 104 These results are not particularly excep tional since longer re action time and higher 
dose of H 2O2 were used. A possible explanation coul d be the fast disappearance of iron 
from the reaction media, probably because the iron forms complexes with compounds 
present in the winery wastewater. Figure 5.4 shows how fast iron disappears from the 
reaction media, especially in the first 100 mi nutes. So to find out whether this poor TOC 
removal could be explained by the very low ir on concentration in solution, the amount of 
iron necessary to maximize solar photo -Fenton was specifically evaluated. 
 
5.3.3.1  Influence of ferrous iron concentration 
 
Photo-Fenton experiments were carried out at two different Fe2+ concentrations, 
55 mg/L and 110 mg/L. Figure 5.5 shows a phot o-Fenton experiment performed with 
110 mg/L. From the data shown, it may be obs erved that no significant improvement was 
achieved by increasing the ir on concentration to double the experiment performed with 
only 55 mg/L. In fact, contrary to what was expected, there is a small decrease in TOC 
removed. In the experiment with 55 mg/L of iron and a t 30w of 250 minutes, TOC 
degradation was 21% whilst with 110 mg /L of iron degradation was only 11%.

 Chapter 5 – Solar photochemical treatment of  winery wastewater in a CPC reactor 
 105This reduction in TOC removal may be explained by redox reactions in which HO• radicals 
are scavenged by reaction with other Fe2+ molecules as displayed below (Reaction 5.7) 
(23). 
Fe2+  +  HO•  →  HO-  +  Fe3+  (R5.7) 
 
Thus, the large amount of ferrous iron added decreases the strength  of the photo-Fenton 
reaction. It was also found that even with a large initial amount of iron, the concentration 
in solution decreases very fast in the first mi nutes, just as it did in the experiment with 
55 mg/L of iron. 
Furthermore, the effect on TOC removal of several additions  of iron during the 
reaction in an attempt to keep the amount of iron in solution constant at around 55 or 
110 mg/L was studied. Figure 5.6 shows the results of these experiments. In the 
experiment started with 55 mg/L of iron, TOC degradation was 44% and in the experiment 
started with 110 mg/L removal was 48% in ar ound the same reaction time (400 minutes). 
These results reveal an improvement in TO C degradation compared to the experiments 
with single additions of iron, especially in  the experiment started with 110 mg/L.

Therefore, the continuous addition of ferr ous iron throughout th e reaction slightly 
improves the solar photo-Fenton degradation ca pacity, however, with continuous addition, Chapter 5 – Solar photochemical treatment of  winery wastewater in a CPC reactor 
 
 106 the total amount of iron is obvi ously larger than with only one dose. Thus, in the 
experiment started with 55 mg/L of ferrous ir on, at the end of reaction, the cumulative total 
of ferrous iron was 153  mg/L, and in the experiment starte d with 110 g/L, it was 323 mg/L.  
Thus, around three times more fe rrous iron was used than in the experiments with a single 
dosage, but this increment in iron does not directly corres pond to an increment in TOC 
degradation, as the large amount of iron added in several additions does not lead to a clear 
improvement in TOC removal, because the difference between 55 mg/L and 110 mg/L on TOC degradation was only 4%. Therefore, the best ferrous iron dosage for solar photo-
Fenton operation is a single dose of 55 mg/L. The next step in the st udy was an in-depth 
analysis of application of photo-Fent on to simulated winery wastewater. 
 5.3.3.2  Influence of the winery  wastewater composition 
 
Figure 5.7 shows the results of several experiments performed with photo-Fenton 
with different initial operating conditions. First,  the effect of wastew ater type (WV or WG) 
on the photo-Fenton experiment with a single 55 -mg/L dose of ferrous iron was evaluated, 
and TOC removal was found to be higher in th e WG sample than in  the WV sample. TOC 
removal was 46% in a t
30W of 400 minutes in WV whilst in WG, degradation was 93%.

 Chapter 5 – Solar photochemical treatment of  winery wastewater in a CPC reactor 
 107So photo-Fenton treatment of winery wastewater is observed to be significantly affected by 
the composition of the wastewater, with a di fference of up to 47%. The next step was 
therefore to assess the applic ation of photo-Fenton in wastew ater containing a mixture of 
WV and WG (WW). 
This simulates real wastewater treatment in  some wineries that have retention tanks 
to store and equalize the seasonal effluent from the different stag es of wine production 
before further treatment in a wastewater trea tment plant. Photo-Fenton treatment of the 
wastewater with WG and WV wa s faster than with either WV or WG alone. TOC removal 
in the mixture was 90% for a t 30W of 150 minutes. This strong removal of the organic load 
present in the wastewater means that photo-Fent on was more efficient in terms of the iron 
dose applied. Therefore, another experiment was done with the mixture of wine and grape 
juice, but with a single dose of ferrous iron of only 20 mg/L. 
Figure 5.7 shows that there are no significant differences in TOC removal due to 
the smaller iron dosage, as after a t 30W of 150 minutes, degrada tion was 84%. Thus, for a 
60% decrease in ferrous iron c oncentration, TOC removal is onl y 6% lower. Therefore, an 
interesting option may be to store and equa lize such wastewater before photo-Fenton 
treatment, which would be significantly mo re economical in terms of ferrous iron 
consumption and TOC degradation. 
 
5.3.3.3  Influence of the ethanol pres ence in winery wastewaters 
 
The main difference between the two type s of wastewater (WV and WG) is that 
WV has a large amount of ethanol and in WG  there is a high conc entration of sugars. 
Therefore, to evaluate the effect of etha nol on the photo-Fenton process and consequently 
on TOC removal, ethanol elimination from th e winery wastewater was evaluated. Ethanol 
was removed from the wastewater made with  diluted wine (WV) by air stripping using 
aquarium pumps and warming the solution to 35 ºC for 24 hours. By removing ethanol, the 
main volatile compound in the wastewater, th e corresponding organic load, equivalent to 
70% of the TOC present in the solution, was also removed, similar to other studies ( 24). 
Although the experiment was done with the same original TOC as the other experiments, a 
large volume of wine without et hanol was added so the initial  TOC would be the same and 
only the ethanol concentration changed. Chapter 5 – Solar photochemical treatment of  winery wastewater in a CPC reactor 
 
 108 Photo-Fenton degradation of this ethanol -free winery wastewater was 96% after a 
t30W of 130 minutes. Based on this assay, it should  be stressed that ethanol significantly 
influences photo-Fenton efficiency. This can be explained by th e ethanol degradation 
pathways during photo-Fenton. Since ethanol is  transformed during pho toxidation, e.g., as 
in photo-Fenton, into acetaldehyde and late r into acetic acid (Reaction 5.8) (25): 
 
CH 3CH 2OH 2O
hυ⎯⎯⎯→ CH 3CHO 2O
hυ⎯⎯⎯→ CH 3COOH  (R5.8) 
Ethanol               Acetaldehyde         Acetic Acid 
 
Acetic acid is a well-known hydroxyl radica l scavenger, as can be observed in the 
following reaction (Reaction 5.9):  
CH
3COOH  +  HO●  →  CH 2COOH●  +  H 2O    (R5.9) 
 Therefore, the lower degradation capacity of  the photo-Fenton proces s when applied to 
WV is because of the action of acetic acid on the hydroxyl radicals. Thus, if the wastewater 
contains a large amount of ethanol, an air stripping pre-treatment prior to photo-Fenton 
significantly increases the efficiency of this advanced oxidation process. 
 
5.3.3.4  COD, total polyphenols and toxicity evolution in photo-Fenton process 
 
Winery wastewater contains significant concentrations of  refractory and even toxic 
compounds. Figure 5.8 shows COD, total pol yphenols and toxicity  during the photo-
Fenton experiment. This experiment was perfor med with winery wastewater prepared with 
ethanol-free WV and WG (c urve * in Figure 5.7). 
Photo-Fenton removes 98% of the COD load  in the winery wastewater after a t
30W 
of 82 minutes. This confirms the pr evious finding of 96% TOC after a t 30W of 130 minutes. 
The total polyphenol content, measured as th e reduction in the concentration of gallic acid, 
was monitored during the photo-Fenton reac tion. This model phenolic compound was 
selected since it is the most representative phenolic acid present in  winery wastewater ( 26-
28). Its concentration increases in the first t 30W of 30 minutes due to aromatic ring Chapter 5 – Solar photochemical treatment of  winery wastewater in a CPC reactor 
 109hydroxylation ( 7), but after that, during the rest of the reaction, it drops to 92% of the 
original polyphenol content.

wastewater. Experimental conditions: [Fe2+]0 = 20 mg/L; [H 2O2]0 = 12 mM; initial pH = 3.0. 
 
The toxicity of the winery wastewater wa s measured with the luminescent bacteria 
Vibrio fischeri , which verified that or iginal toxicity decrease s after photo-Fenton, making 
the wastewater more acceptable for biol ogical treatment. At first, after a tw 30 of 15 minutes 
of contact with the winery wastewater,  Vibrio fischeri  showed 48% inhibition, but at tw30 
of 25 minutes, the percentage of inhibition de creased to 44%, although afterwards toxicity 
increased again to 82%. This can be e xplained by the increase d content in total 
polyphenols, making the wastewater more toxi c. Afterwards, as photo-Fenton progressed, 
toxicity dropped to 28% when COD was re duced 98% and the total polyphenol content 
92%. 
As final remarks, this study shows that heterogeneous photocatalysis (TiO 2, 
TiO 2/H2O2, TiO 2/Na 2S2O8) of simulated winery wastewater is inefficient in removing 
TOC, with best performance of only 25% TOC degradati on. Homogeneous photocatalysis 
with solar photo-Fenton in th e CPC reactor showed a TOC removal efficiency of 46% with 
simulated wine (WV) wastewater and 93% with grape juice (WG) in a t 30W of 400 minutes. 
However TOC removal was 90% in a 50:50 WV and WG mixture after a t 30W of 150 
minutes. Chapter 5 – Solar photochemical treatment of  winery wastewater in a CPC reactor 
 
 110 If ethanol is previously removed from th e winery wastewater mixture (WW) by air 
stripping, TOC degradation is 96% . In addition to this high TO C degradation, toxicity also 
decreases significantly from 48% to 28%, almost completely eliminating polyphenols 
(92%) as well. So as a final remark, solar photo-Fenton may be considered an efficient 
treatment for winery wastewater treatment, esp ecially if air stripping is previously applied 
to remove ethanol.  
5.4 Conclusions 
 
This work shows that hetero geneous photocatalysis (TiO
2, TiO 2/H2O2, 
TiO 2/Na 2S2O8) of a simulated winery wastewater reveals to be inefficient on TOC 
removal, achieving in the best performance a TOC degradation of 25%. The obtained 
results with homogeneous photocatalysis w ith solar photo-Fenton process in the CPC 
reactor have shown that it can be reached a TOC removal efficiency of 46% with a 
simulated wastewater carried out with wine (WV) and 93% with grape juice (WG) in a t 30W 
of 400 minutes. Mixing WV with WG in  a ratio 50:50 a TOC removal of 90% was 
achieved for a t 30W of 150 minutes. 
If an air stripping process is previously a pplied for ethanol removal from the winery 
wastewater mixture (WW), a TO C degradation of 96% is obta ined. Besides this high TOC 
degradation a significant detoxification occurs, given the fact that the toxicity level decreases from 48% to 28%, as well as almost  total elimination of the total polyphenols 
(92%). So, as a final remark  solar photo-Fenton process can be defined as an efficient 
treatment process to winery wastewater treatment , especially if air st ripping is previously 
applied for ethanol removal.

Abstract 
 
The degradation of organic substances presen t in winery wastewater was studied in a  
pilot-scale, bubble column ozonation react or. A steady reduction of chemical oxygen 
demand (COD) was observed under the action of oz one at the natural pH of the wastewater 
(pH 4). At alkaline and neutra l pH the degradation rate was accelerated by the formation of 
radical species from the decomposition of oz one. Furthermore, the reaction of hydrogen 
peroxide (formed from natural organic matter in the wastewater) and ozone enhances the 
oxidation capacity of the ozonation process. The monitoring of pH, redox potential (ORP), 
UV absorbance (254 nm), polyphenols content an d ozone consumption was correlated with 
the oxidation of the organic species in the wate r. The ozonation of winery wastewater in 
the bubble column was analysed in terms of  a mole balance coupled with ozonation 
kinetics modeled by the two-film theory of mass transfer and chemical reaction. It was 
determined that the ozonation reaction can de velop both in and across different kinetic 
regimes: fast, moderate and slow, depending on the experimental conditions. The dynamic change of the rate coefficient estimated by the model was correlated with changes in the 
water composition and oxidant species.

 116 6.1 Introduction 
 
The wine industry generates a seasonal e ffluent which is characterized by a high 
organic load. The organic load and its com position depends on the stages used during the 
production of the wine (e.g., vintage, racking, bottling) and on the winemaking technology 
(e.g. production of red, white a nd special wines) (Malandra et al., 2003; Artiga et al., 
2005). These effluents usually referred to as “winery wastewater” originated from various 
unit operations such as washing of the pres ses used to crush th e grapes, rinsing of 
fermentation tanks, barrels, bottles and other e quipments or surfaces (Petruccioli et al., 
2000; Malandra et al., 2003; Beck et al., 2005; Most eo et al., 2006). 
Winery wastewater has a high concentr ation of polyphenols, organic acids and 
sugars with typical COD values in the range from 3 to 30 g L-1 (Benitez et al., 1999a; Pirra, 
2005), and it is toxic to the aquatic environm ent and needs treatment before discharge. 
Current methods of treatment of winery wastewater include physical and chemical 
processes. However, the high bio-recalcitrance and toxicity of phenolic contaminants in the 
winery wastewater cause difficulties in the biol ogical treatment of these wastewaters. The 
presence of refractory compounds, in additio n to the large quantities of waste sludge 
generated, in practice limits the applicability and efficiency of such treatment methods 
(Legrini et al., 1993; Benitez et al., 1999b). 
Advanced oxidation processes (AOP) can be  efficient methods for the treatment of 
refractory wastewater characte rized by a high organic load. AOP  involve the generation of 
highly reactive radical species, predominantly hydroxyl radical (HO•) (L egrini et al., 1993; 
Litter, 2005). The application of AOP to wi nery wastewater is usually limited to the 
destruction of the refractory compounds (pol yphenols) with the obj ective of rendering the 
wastewater more viable to biologic al treatment (Beltran et al, 1999). 
Ozone is a strong oxidizer having high r eactivity towards orga nic compounds such 
as polyphenols. Ozonation has been previously  used for the treatment of polyphenols 
loaded wastewater such as from the cork  manufacturing industry (Benitez et al., 2003a; 
Lan et al, 2008), the olive oil industry (Benite z et al., 1997; Beltran-Heredia et al., 2000) 
and the wine distillery industry (Beltrán et al, 1999; Beltrán et al. 2001; Benitez et al., 
1999c; Benitez et al., 2003b; Monteagudo, 2005; Santos et al, 2003). Hydroxyl radicals

media (Sotelo et al., 1987). 
The treatment of winery wastewater by oz onation and ozone related processes have 
been demonstrated in small- scale laboratory studies. Gimeno et al., (2007) reported the 
photocatalytic ozonation of winery wastewater in a 1 L reactor and the total mineralization 
of the COD removed in the pres ence of UV-A ozone and tita nium dioxide. Navarro et al. 
(2005) investigated the degrad ation of winery industrial wastewater by photocatalytic 
oxidation, UV-peroxidation and Fent on reaction over iron rich clay s in 100 ml glass vials. 
Ozonation has been successfully applied to th e treatment of wine distillery wastewater 
(Beltrán et al, 1999; Beltrán et al. 2001; Benitez et al., 2003a; Santos et al, 2003) in small, 
laboratory scale reactors.  
In this work, the kinetics of ozonation of wi nery wastewater is studied in detail in a 
pilot-scale, semi-batch bubble column reactor  previously employed for the treatment of 
cork-processing water (Lan et al, 2008). The study investigates the relationship between 
pH, ORP, COD, UV absorbance (254 nm ), total polyphenol content and ozone 
consumption as a function of time, as well as, the prevalent kine tic conditions (fast, 
intermediate, and slow kinetic regime) for the reaction of ozone with the dissolved organic 
species. Furthermore, a kinetic ozonation m odel is presented and used to estimate the 
kinetic coefficients of the ozonation of  winery wastewater under the prevailing 
experimental conditions. In contrast with prev ious work carried out in laboratory scale 
reactors, this study considers the ozonation of winery wastewater in  a pilot-scale bubble 
column reactor, which facilitate scale-up and practical application in  the wine industry.

6.2.2 Ozonation 
 
The ozonation experiments were conducted in a bubble-column se mi-batch reactor 
(internal diameter 0.1 m, hei ght 1 m) made of QVF borosili cate glass. The reactor was 
equipped with a liquid stream ou tlet at the bottom and an inle t at the top, connected to a 
peristaltic pump (Masterflex 77200-62, Cole-Parmer,  USA) to assist water recirculation in 
the reactor. An in-line redox poten tial (ORP) sensor was installe d in the water recirculation 
tube. The gas stream enriched with ozone ente red the reactor via a sintered stainless steel 
porous disk S20 (Porvair Ltd., UK, mean pore size 15 μm) at the bottom of the reactor. A 
gas stream outlet at the top of the reactor le d to a thermal ozone destructor. Liquid samples 
were collected with a syringe through a sealed port in the reactor. The ozone concentration 
at the gas inlet and outlet of the reactor were measured by redirecting the flows to a series 
of Dreschel flasks containing a 2% potassium iodide solution. 
High purity oxygen (99.999 %, BOC gases, UK) was fed to a silica drier to remove 
trace water prior to entering the ozone generator (OZOMAX 8Vtt, Ozomax, Canada) 
capable of producing up to 0.68 g ozone per minute. The hydrodynamic and operational conditions used in this study are summarised in Table 6.2 with the symbols presented in the nomenclature section.

 119Nine liters of winery wastewater were charged into the reactor and the degradation 
experiments were performed with continuous  ozone supply for various time periods. The 
water was re-circulated at a flow rate of 1 L per minute in order to improve the mixing of 
the liquid in the reactor, in addition to the mixing provided by the gas bubbles . 
Water samples were withdrawn regularly and analysed. The pH was monitored at 
regular intervals through the ozonation process a nd, if required, it was controlled using 0.1 
M NaOH or 0.1 M H 2SO 4 solutions. All solutions and reagents were prepared in ultra-pure 
water, supplied by a NANOpure Diamond UV water purification system that provides 
bacteria free water with resistivity of 18.2 M Ω cm-1 or higher and TOC < 1 ppb. All of the 
oxidation experiments were performed in dup licate and the observed standard deviation 
was always less than 7% of the reported value.  
6.2.3
 Analytical methods 
 
The organic matter in the samples was characterised in terms of COD  (HACH, 
model 45600 coupled with a colori meter HACH, ODYSSEY) and TOC  (Shimadzu TOC-
VCPH). The absorbance of samples was de termined by a UV/vis Spectrophotometer, UV 
mini 1240 Shimadzu. The Folin-Ciocalteau met hod, using gallic acid as a standard, was 
followed to evaluate the total polyphenol co ntent in the samples (Singleton and Rossi, 
1965). Peroxide concentration in the samples was measured  by means of Merckoquant 
Peroxide Test strips (0-25 mg H 2O2 L-1). If required, the samples were diluted several 
times in order to achieve an accurate measurement of the H 2O2 concentration. 
 
6.2.4 Ozone consumption 
 
The instantaneous rate of ozone consumption (g L-1 s-1) was calculated by a 
macroscopic material balance across the bubble column reactor as:

6.3 Results and Discussions 
6.3.1 Ozonation kinetics of winery wastewater 
Ozonation experiments were carri ed out at the natural pH of the winery wastewater 
(pH = 4) and at two other initial pH, 7 and 10, in order to investigate the effect of radical 
formation on the rate of COD removal. The pH was not controlled by buffer during the 
oxidation experiments. Figure 6.1 shows the ev olution of pH during experiments carried 
out at pH of 4, 7, and 10. A slight decreas e in pH from 4 to 3.5 was observed in the 
experiments performed at the natural pH. A sh arp decrease in the pH of the solution was 
observed in the experiments with  initial pH of 7 and 10, and the final pH was observed to 
be 3.8 and 4.2, respectively.

 121The reduction in pH is attri buted to the formation of dicarboxylic acids and small 
molecule organic acids, as well as CO 2 and carbonic acid from total mineralization. The 
degradation of organic matter in  the wastewater occurs by di rect reaction with molecular 
ozone at pH = 4. Conversely, ozone decompos ition to highly reactive radical species (i.e., 
HO 2•, O2•-, HO 3•, O3•-, HO•) takes place at pH 7 and pH 10 (Hoigne and Bader, 1976).

 122 The self-decomposition of ozone to  radicals lasted 5 min in th e experiment starting at pH = 
7 and 40 min in the experiment at pH = 10, since the decomposition of  ozone to radicals 
can be considered to be negligible at pH less than 5.5 (Hoigne and Bader, 1976). 
Figure 6.2 shows the removal of COD during the ozonation process and the 
evolution of the total aromatic content (A) in the wastewater measured by the absorbance 
at 254 nm. The fastest removal rates were obser ved at alkaline pH as a result of the fast 
reaction of the organic matter with radica l species formed. A rapid decrease of the 
absorbance was observed during the first 30 min,  and this decrease was faster at pH 10 due 
to the rapid reaction of organic matter with  molecular ozone and with radicals. The 
absorbance approached a plateau at longer times indicating the formation of refractory 
intermediates as well as radi cals’ scavenger species (e.g., carbonates). The UV/vis spectra 
for the experiment at pH 10 are shown in Figure 6.3.

A decrease in absorbance was observed, in general, as the reaction proceeded. The 
absorbance in the visible range of the spectrum decreased at a faster rate compared to the 
absorbance in the UV region. As a consequence,  a very rapid colour removal was observed 
during the ozonation experiment and the colour changed from li ght brown to clear after 4

 123The total polyphenol content, measured as the reduction in the concentration of 
gallic acid, was monitored during the ozonation reaction (Figure 6.4). This model phenolic 
compound was selected since it is  the most representative pheno lic acid presen t in winery 
wastewaters (La Torre et al., 2006; Silva et al., 2006; Lucas et  al., 2008). The removal of 
polyphenols is required if the objective of  the treatment is to render the water 
biodegradable.

In contrast with the results  presented in Figure 6.2, the removal rate of polyphenol 
at pH 10 and pH 7 was lower than at pH 4. At pH 4 mo lecular ozone alone reacts with the 
wastewater constituents, however, at pH 10 the predominant reaction mechanism is by 
radical oxidation. These result s suggest that in a complex mixture of polyphenols and other 
species reacting with the oxida nt (ozone and/or reactive ra dicals), the selectivity of 
molecular ozone towards attack of polyphenols is higher than the selectivity of the radicals 
for polyphenols. In the presence of radicals th e reaction of these w ith easily oxidizable 
organic matter in the wastewater other than  polyphenols is favoured, which is supported by 
the preferential removal of subs tances absorbing visible radiati on (Figure 6.3). Santos et al. 
(2003) have reported similar results for the degr adation of phenol in vinasse wastewater in 
the presence of ozone. The degradation rate of phenol was found to be faster at acidic pH Chapter 6 – Ozonation kinetics of winery wastewater in a pilot-scale bubble column reactor 
 
 
 124 than at alkaline pH. Furthermore, Gurol and Vatistas (1987) have show n that the selectivity 
of ozone for phenolic compounds decreases as the pH was increased. The differences in 
the selectivity of ozone and radicals for pol yhenols are associated with the different 
mechanism of oxidation by these species, with  ozone following elec trophilic attack of 
electron rich sites of the target molecule  (Gurol and Nekouinaini, 1984), and reactive 
radicals reacting unselectively with all spec ies in solution (e.g., the OH radical reacts by 
either hydrogen abstraction, OH addition or substitution, or by electron transfer).  
Therefore, it may be concluded that the ozonation at natural pH (acidic pH) should 
be favoured over the same reacti on at alkaline pH, if the purpose of the treatment of winery 
wastewater is the removal of the phenolic compounds, such as the removal of toxicity prior to further biological treatment. 
The possibility of peroxide formation by reaction of ozone with natural organic 
matter was monitored during the ozonation expe riments. The results obtained for three 
different experiments at differe nt initial COD are plotted in Figure 6.5, assuming that the 
peroxides species generated we re mainly hydrogen peroxide.

 Chapter 6 – Ozonation kinetics of winery wastewater in a pilot-scale bubble column reactor 
 
 125The amount of hydrogen peroxide generated by the reaction of organic matter with 
ozone was found to vary with th e initial organic load, and to  follow a linear dependence on 
time. The rate of hydrogen peroxide  produced was found to be 0.44 mg L-1 min-1 for the 
experiment with the highest initial COD load (4650 mg O 2 L-1). Decreasing the initial 
COD of the wastewater by 10 a nd 20 times the rate of H 2O2 formed was 0.17 mg L-1 min-1 
and 0.06 mg L-1 min-1, respectively. These results are in  agreement with those reported by 
others (Latifoglu and Gurol, 2003)  who reported the production of H 2O2 to be the result of 
the reaction of ozone with natural organic ma tter (NOM) (R6.1) which is also present in 
the winery wastewater.  
O
3  +  NOM  →  H2O2    (R6.1) 
 
The formation of hydrogen peroxide duri ng the ozonation of winery wastewater 
enhances the oxidation capacity of the ozona tion process through seco ndary reactions. The 
interaction of H 2O2 with O 3 leads to the production of reactive radicals (HO•, HO 2• and  
O3•-) that present higher oxidati on capacity (reactions 6.2-6. 6) than hydrogen peroxide 
and/or ozone (Legrini et al., 1993). This effect  is more significant at later stages of the 
ozonation reaction once hydrogen peroxide  has accumulated in the system.

O3•-  +  H 2O  →  HO•  +  HO-  +  O 2    (R6.6) 
 
6.3.2 Ozone consumption 
 
During the experiments the rate of ozone  consumption was monitored through the 
measurement of the ozone mass flow rate at the inlet and at the outlet of the reactor (Figure 
6.6a). The mass flow rate at the reacto r inlet was kept constant throughout each 
experiment. The difference between the values at  the inlet and outlet of the reactor defines 
the rate of ozone consumed within the reactor. This includes the contribution from the 
reaction of molecular ozone with  the organic matter, and can also include the contribution Chapter 6 – Ozonation kinetics of winery wastewater in a pilot-scale bubble column reactor 
 
 
 126 from ozone decomposition at alkaline pH and ozone consumption by the hydrogen 
peroxide formed. It should be noted that the ozone flow rate at the reactor outlet was found 
to be lower than that at the inlet suggesti ng that a certain degree of ozone decomposition 
occurred even in those cases controlled by the reaction kinetics.  
An experimental indication of the prevalen t kinetic regime at various reaction times 
is provided by the dynamic change of the ORP of the water and ozone consumption during 
the ozonation experiments (Lan et al., 2008). Figure 6.6b shows the evolution of the ORP 
during the same experiments. For the experiment  at initial pH 10 ther e is a gradual increase 
in ORP up to 40 min during which the pH of th e solution varies from  10 to 5 (pH evolves 
as shown in Figure 6.1). During the first 40 min there is a sharp reduction in UVC 
absorbance (Figure 6.1) and a high rate of oz one consumption, which is clearly caused by 
the very fast reaction of the organic matter with hydroxyl radicals formed at these pH 
values. After 40 min, the pH < 5.5 and the OR P levels out and reaches values well below 
those expected for water saturated with  ozone (1100 mV). Although, ozone self-
decomposition is suppressed at these pH va lues, ozone continues to react with the 
hydrogen peroxide formed (Figure 6.5) producing radical species that in turn, rapidly react 
with the organic matter. Simultaneously, molecular ozone also reacts with the organic matter. Overall, the reaction will be shown (s ee Section 6.3.4) to be in the fast kinetic 
regime with the reaction occurring at the ga s-liquid interface and with little or no ozone 
dissolved in the bulk liquid.  
At pH 7, there is a rapid increase in OR P and ozone mass flow rate at the reactor 
outlet that lasts 10 min, corresponding to the period in which ozone self-decomposition occurs. At longer reaction time the ORP and the rate of ozone consumption become 
constant. The ozone mass flow rate at the reac tor outlet is higher than in the experiment 
performed at pH 10 due to the lower amount of hydrogen peroxide produced. Overall, the 
reaction will be shown to be in the fast kine tic regime with the reaction occurring at the 
gas-liquid interface and with  little or no ozone dissolved in the bulk liquid.

ozonation of winery wastewater at different initial pH.  The ozone mass rate at the reactor inlet is

L min-1; ozone partial pressure 1.31 kPa; initial COD 4650 mg L-1; initial pH 4 ( ), 7 (y) and 10 
(c). 
 
At pH 4, the ORP instantaneously reaches the level corresponding to the saturation 
of the liquid with ozone. The ozone mass flow  rate at the reactor outlet also rapidly 
increases to a level closer to that at the inlet of the reactor. However, once the hydrogen 
peroxide is formed at later stages of the reaction the ORP decreases , as well as, the ozone Chapter 6 – Ozonation kinetics of winery wastewater in a pilot-scale bubble column reactor 
 
 
 128 flow rate at the reactor outlet.  At this stage of the reaction, ozone is consumed by hydrogen 
peroxide yielding radicals that in turn react with the organic matter. The above 
observations suggest that the r eaction is in the slow kinetic regime at the beginning of the 
reaction time, indicating that the reaction of ozone with organic matter occurs in the bulk 
liquid, however the kinetic regi me (Hatta number) will increa se at later stages of the 
oxidation reaction due to the formation of hydr ogen peroxide and, in consequence, of 
highly reactive radicals. 
After 1 hour of reaction the ORP values stabilise around 500 mV, independently of 
the initial pH. This suggests th at the oxidation of organic matte r in the winery wastewater 
may proceed following a similar reaction mechanism, involving the reaction with radicals generated by the reaction of  ozone with hydrogen peroxide (reactions R6.2-R6.6). 
 
6.3.3
 Ozonation kinetics model 
 
COD was used as a global c oncentration parameter to describe the complex kinetics 
of removal of organic matter a nd to derive the essential ki netic parameters needed for 
reactor design and optimisation. A simplified ki netic model was developed to represent the 
kinetics of degradation of winery wastewater  in the bubble column reactor. The kinetics of 
COD removal by molecular ozone was represen ted by a second order irreversible reaction 
as follows:  
products     COD O
1 3 → +z     (R6.7) 
 
In the presence of ozone decomposition to  radicals at alkaline pH, the following 
stoichiometry can be approximated for the pur pose of modeling the ozonation of winery 
wastewater in the reactor:

Adding reactions (R6.7-R6.12) the global kinetics of COD removal by molecular 
ozone can be represented by a second order irreversible reaction as follows:  
products     COD O
3 → +z     (R6.13) 
 
where the overall stoichiometric coefficient z (= z1 + z2 + z3) can be estimated from the 
instantaneous rate of COD de pletion and the rate of ozon e consumption (Eq. 6.2). The 
value of z was found to vary with reaction time a nd experimental conditions in the range 
from 0.4 to 1.4 on a weight basis. 
The model of the bubble column reactor wa s developed as follows. The gas phase 
in the reactor was assumed to be in plug flow  and the liquid phase was considered to be 
well mixed under the action of the bubbles and of the external recirculation flow. The 
ozone mole balance in the absence of the accumulation term, which can be safely 
neglected, leads to:

The overall rate of ozone consumption – rO3 per unit volume of liquid depends on the 
relative effect of gas-liquid ozone mass tran sfer and ozone reaction in the liquid phase. 
Thus, the overall rate of ozone consumption ma y be controlled by either one or the other or 
a combination of both. Accord ing to the two-film theory by Lewis and Whitman (1924) the 
corresponding kinetic regimes can be di scerned by calculating the Hatta number:

ozone diffusion coefficient in the liquid and k L is the ozone mass transfer coefficient to the

If 0.03 < Ha < 0.3 (slow reaction with resp ect to mass transfer) the liquid contains 
dissolved ozone but at a lower concentration than the saturation level. As the value of 
Hatta approaches 0.3 the dissolv ed ozone concentration in th e bulk liquid approaches zero 
and the overall rate of ozone c onsumption is controlled by mass transfer of ozone from the 
bulk gas to the liquid. According to the tw o film theory, the overall rate of ozone

E is the liquid film enhancement factor, de fined as the ratio of  the rate of ozone

If 0.03 < Ha < 0.3, E ≈ 1 and Eq. (6.8) reduces to Eq. (6.7). Note that in a semi-
batch bubble column reactor the partial pr essure of ozone and the rate of ozone 
consumption vary with column height (see Eq . 6.8); therefore the analysis of the reactor 
must follow a numerical calculation which disc retises the column height in sufficiently 
small elements in which the partial pressure of ozone can be considered to be constant.  
6.3.4
 Estimation of reaction rate co efficient and ki netic regimes 
 
Since the COD of the winery wastewater  varies with reaction time, the Hatta 
number takes different values as the reaction proceeds and, as a result, several kinetic regimes may be realised during the same experi mental run. The implications are that the 
reaction may initially occur at the gas-liquid interphase with no contribution from the bulk 
liquid when Hatta is higher than  0.3, shifting towards the bulk liquid at later stages of the 
ozonation reaction (Ha << 0.3). 
An experimental indication of the prevalen t kinetic regime at various reaction times 
is provided by the dynamic change of the ORP of the water and ozone consumption during 
the ozonation experiments as di scussed in Section 6.3.2.  Chapter 6 – Ozonation kinetics of winery wastewater in a pilot-scale bubble column reactor 
 
 
 132 The Hatta number can change as a result of a change in the COD or in the reaction rate 
coefficient, which is not unexpected since th e ozonation reaction of complex water can be 
considered to follow a series-parallel reacti on scheme. More likely the rate coefficient 
would be higher at the beginning of the ozona tion since the easily oxidizable species can 
react rapidly with ozone and/ or with radical species. 
The reaction kinetic coefficient k O3 (L of liquid s-1 g-1) as a function of reaction time 
in each experiment was estimated by a numerical  iterative process involving Eqs. (3) and 
(7) when Ha < 0.3, and Eqs. (6.3) and (6.8) when Ha > 0.3. The algorithm developed for this purpose has been presented by Lan et al., (2008). Since the pH varied during the 
reaction time (Figure 6.1), the depe ndence of the Henry law constant H (kPa L mg
-1) from 
pH was included in the calculations. The equati on of Roth and Sullivan et al. (1981) with 
different units was used:

 134 Figure 6.7 show the dynamic change of the reaction rate coeffici ents as a function 
of time calculated from the model for experime nts conducted at differe nt ozone superficial 
velocities and at different ini tial pH. Exp 1 and 2 were carried  out at initial pH 4 and 4.2 
but with different initial CODs  differing by one order of ma gnitude and at different gas 
flow rates. The dynamic change of the reactio n rate coefficients of these experiments 
overlaps suggesting that the reactor mode l and assumptions were satisfactory.  
The ozonation reaction for the experiment quot ed in Exp 1 begins in the moderate 
kinetic regime with a Hatta number 1.1 but qu ickly reaches the regi on of slow kinetic 
regime with mass transfer cont rol (0.03 < Ha < 0.3). The Hatta number decreases since the 
COD decreases, then it increases due to th e accumulation of hydroge n peroxide (Figure 
6.5) and its reaction with ozone and formati on of radicals. These re sults corroborate with 
the trend of ozone consumption and ORP obser ved in Figure 6.6. Conversely, when the 
initial COD and gas flow rate were reduced (E xp 2) the reaction evolves exclusively in the 
very slow kinetic regime (Ha < 0.03) indicatin g that the reaction is occurring in the bulk 
liquid. An experimental observation for such  behavior was provided by the measurement 
of the ozone mass flow rate at the reactor outlet, which reached a level close to that at the 
inlet of the bubble column (resu lts not shown) suggesting the saturation of the liquid with 
ozone. 
The experiments performed at initial pH  of 7 and 10 evolve entirely in the 
moderate/fast kinetic regime (Ha > 0.3) in the time frame of th e experiments. It should be 
noted that in the first 5 min (Exp 3) and 40 mi n (Exp 4) of reaction time, the organic matter 
would react with hydroxyl radicals in additio n to the reaction with ozone, since the pH 
remained above the value of 5.5 (Figure 6.1). As a result the value of the reaction rate 
coefficients estimated from the kinetic model can take very large va lues. Typical reaction 
rate constants for the reaction of organics w ith hydroxyl radicals are re ported to be of the 
order of 109 L mol-1s-1 (Hoigne and Bader, 1976). However, despite such high values of the 
reaction rate coefficient, the rate of COD removal is limited by the rate of ozone mass transfer from the gas bubble to the liquid film. Once the pH descends below 5.5 the 
reaction of organic matter occu rs with molecular ozone alone and with radical species 
formed through reactions (R6.2-R6.6). As a re sult, the reaction rate coefficients remain 
relatively high compared to those in experiment s 1 and 2. Beltrán et al., (1999) reported the 
ozonation of wine distillery wastewater (vinasse  wastewater) to devel op in the fast kinetic 
regime with a reaction rate coefficient of 1 L mg
-1 min-1, a value close to the results for Chapter 6 – Ozonation kinetics of winery wastewater in a pilot-scale bubble column reactor 
 
 135Exp 4. Benitez et al., (2003b)  also reported the ozonation of vinasses and assumed the 
reaction to be in the slow  kinetic regime and estima ted an average value of k03 of 3.80x10-3 
L mg-1 min-1, which is of the same order as those found in Exp 1 and 2.  
In contrast to the above st udies carried out in laborator y scale reactors, our results 
show that the ozonation of winery wastewat er may develop both in and across different 
kinetic regimes depending on the experimental  conditions. They further show that, under 
the present experimental conditions, the treatm ent of winery wastewater follows a dynamic 
process which reflects the changes in com position of the wastewater during treatment.   
 
6.4 Conclusions 
 
The application of ozonation in a pilot-scale bubble column reactor was proven to 
be effective in the degradatio n of organic substances presen t in winery wastewater. The 
degradation of aromatics and polyphenol content was found to be  significantly faster than 
the decrease in COD. This suggests that ozona tion may be considered as pre-treatment to 
further biological treatment. The degrada tion rate of organic matter and aromatics 
increases at alkaline pH, how ever, polyphenols are more effici ently removed at  acidic pH. 
At alkaline and neutral pH th e degradation rate was accelerated  by the formation of radical 
species from the decomposition of ozone, howe ver, the observed kinetics was limited by 
mass transfer at the gas-liqui d interface. Hydrogen peroxide , formed by the reaction of 
ozone with natural organic matter in the wa stewater, was found to enhance the oxidation 
capacity of the ozonation process.  
Monitoring of pH, ORP and the rate of oz one consumption gave insights into the 
prevalent kinetic regimes during the ozonation process. The reaction was found to develop 
in and across different kinetic regimes: fast, moderate and slow depending on the 
experimental conditions. As a result, beside the use of bubble columns (large bulk volume) 
which are recommended for gas-liquid reactions in the slow kinetic regime (reaction in the 
bulk liquid), other gas-liquid ozonation contactor s that offer large contact surface area to 
volume ratios may be considered if the reacti on develops predominantly in the fast or 
moderate kinetic regime (reacti on at the gas-liquid interface). 
A kinetic model of the ozonation proce ss occurring in the semi-batch bubble 
column reactor was presented and was coupled w ith a second order irreversible reaction of 
ozone with the dissolved organic matter. Th e dynamic change of the rate coefficient Chapter 6 – Ozonation kinetics of winery wastewater in a pilot-scale bubble column reactor 
 
 
 136 estimated by the model was correlated with changes in the water composition and oxidant 
species. The model presented and the rate coe fficient determined can be used for design 
and scale-up of ozonation bubble columns for the treatment of winery wastewater under 
similar experimental conditions as in this work.

Abstract 
 
The effectiveness of different ozone-b ased advanced oxidation processes (O 3, O 3/UV and 
O3/UV/H 2O2) on the treatment of winery wastewater  was investigated in a pilot-scale, 
bubble column reactor. At the natural pH of th e wastewater (pH 4) the effectiveness of 
each AOP followed the sequence: O 3/UV/H 2O2 > O 3/UV > O 3 > UV-C. The rate of 
chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total orga nic carbon (TOC) removal were enhanced 
further by operation at neutral (pH 7) a nd at alkaline pH (pH 10). The underlying 
chemistry involved in each of the AOPs is di scussed and correlated with the observed 
reactivity. The rate of ozone consumption in the reactor with the O 3/UV and O 3/UV/H 2O2 
processes was in the region from 70-95% during  the experiments, suggesting an effective 
use of the ozone supplied to the system. In all the experiments the disappearance of the 
winery wastewater organic load was descri bed by pseudo-first order apparent reaction 
kinetics. The faster rate constant (6.5x10-3 min-1), at the natural pH of the wastewater, was 
observed with the O 3/UV/H 2O2 process under optimised oxidant dose (COD/H 2O2 = 2). An 
economical analysis on the operating costs of the AOPs processes inves tigated revealed the 
O3/UV/H 2O2 to be the most economical process (1.31 Euro m-3 g-1 of TOC mineralised 
under optimised conditions) to tr eat the winery wastewater.

 142 7.1. Introduction 
 
Wine is an alcoholic beverage made of  fermented grape ju ice. Producing wine 
requires the implementation of several unit operations (grape reception, must production, 
fermentation, decanting, maturation-stabilizat ion, filtration and transportation-disposal) 
(Brito et al., 2007; Strong and Burgess, 200 8). In the unit operat ions performed in 
wineries, distilleries and othe r grape processing industries, la rge volumes of waste streams 
are generated annually. These incl ude organic waste (solids, skin s, pips, etc.), wastewater, 
greenhouse gases (CO 2, volatile organic compounds, et c.) and inorganic wastes 
(diatomaceous earth, bentonite clay and perlit e). It is estimated that a cellar produces 
between 1.3 and 1.5 kg of residues per litre of wine produced, 75% of which is winery wastewater (Arnaiz et al., 2007).  
The organic content of winery wastewat er consists of highly soluble sugars, 
alcohols, acids and recalcitrant high- molecular-weight compounds (e.g., polyphenols, 
tannins and lignans) not easily removabl e by physical or chemical means. 
Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) are known for their capability to mineralise 
a wide range of organic compounds. AOPs i nvolve the generation of highly reactive 
radical species, predominantly the hydroxyl ra dical (HO•) (Legrini et al., 1993; Litter, 
2005). Ozone is a strong oxidize r having high reactiv ity and selectivity towards organic 
compounds such as polyphenols. Among AOPs, ozonation and ozonation in combination 
with UV-C radiation and/or peroxidation has been  shown to be effectiv e in the treatment of 
wastewater with high polyphenol s content such as from th e cork manufacturing industry 
(Benitez, Acero et al., 2003; Lan et al., 2008), the olive oil industry (Benitez et al., 1997; 
Beltrán-Heredia et al., 2000) and the wine dist illery industry (Beltrán  et al., 1999; Beltrán-
Heredia et al., 2001; Benitez et  al., 1999; Benitez, Real et  al., 2003; Monteagudo et al., 
2005; Santos et al., 2003). One major advantag e of the application of ozone-based AOPs 
(O
3, O3/UV and O 3/UV/H 2O2) in the treatment of comple x wastewater, of polyphenols and 
other species, rests in the hi gher selectivity of molecular ozone towards polyphenols when 
compared to the reaction of these with ra dical species (e.g., the hydroxyl radical). The 
differences in the selectivity of ozone and ra dicals for polyphenols ar e associated with the 
different mechanism of oxidation by these species, with ozone following electrophilic 
attack of electron rich sites of the target molecule (Gurol  and Nekouinaini, 1984) and Chapter 7 – Application of O 3/UV and O 3/UV/H 2O2 processes to winery wastewater in a pilot bubble column reactor 
 
 
 143reactive radicals reacting unselectively with al l species in solution (e.g., the OH• radical 
reacts by either hydrogen abstra ction, OH addition or substituti on, or by electron transfer).  
On the other hand, the oxidation potential of the hydroxyl radical (E 0 = 2.80 mV) is 
much higher than that of ozone (E 0 = 2.07 mV), therefore, the combination of ozone with 
UV and/or H 2O2 which yields hydroxyl, peroxyl an d superoxide radicals should 
synergistically accelerate the removal of organic matter from complex wastewater 
matrices. 
The treatment of winery wastewater  by ozonation and ozone related AOPs 
processes have been demonstr ated in small and pilot scal e studies. Gimeno et al. (2007) 
reported the photocatalytic ozonation of winery wastewater in a 1 L reactor and the total mineralization of the COD removed in the pr esence of UV-A, ozone and titanium dioxide. 
Navarro et al. (2005) investigated the de gradation of wine i ndustry wastewater by 
photocatalytic oxidation, UV-peroxidation and Fe nton reaction over iron rich clays in 100

In our previous work (Lucas et al., 2009) , we have investigat ed the kinetics of 
ozonation of winery wastewater in detail in a pilot-scale (9 L), semi-batch bubble column 
reactor under alkaline, neutral and acidic conditions. We have  concluded that ozonation 
prior to biological treatment c ould be beneficial to remove the toxicity (polyphenols) from 
the wastewater. The degradation of arom atics and polyphenols was found to be 
significantly faster than the decrease in COD.  
In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of different ozone-based AOP (O
3, 
O3/UV and O 3/UV/H 2O2) on the treatment of winery wast ewater, in a pilot-plant scale 
reactor, with the objective of suggesting the most efficient process for implementation by 
the industry. The effect of initial pH, orga nic load of winery wastewater and hydrogen 
peroxide concentration were inve stigated in the same pilot scal e reactor. The effect of each 
AOP on the reduction of chemical oxygen de mand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) 
was evaluated and operating costs were estimated.

7.2.2 Ozonation 
 
The ozonation and the ozone-based AOPs (O 3/UV and O 3/UV/H 2O2) experiments 
were conducted in a bu bble-column semi-batch reactor (i nternal diameter 0.1 m, height 1 
m) made of QVF borosilicate glass equipped with  a quartz UV lamp tube (external 
diameter 40 mm) mounted in the axial positio n which houses the lamp (Figure 7.1). The 
UV-C lamp used (Philips TUV36W, bulb dimensions: 1.156 m long, 28 mm diameter) 
emits predominantly monochromatic radiation at 253.7 nm.

 145The reactor was equipped with a liquid str eam outlet at the bottom and an inlet at 
the top, connected to a pe ristaltic pump (Masterflex 77200-62, Cole-Parmer, USA) to 
assist water recirculation in  the reactor. An in-line redox  potential (ORP) sensor was 
installed in the water recirculation tube. The gas stream enriched with ozone entered the 
reactor via a sintered stainles s steel porous disk S20 (Porva ir Ltd., UK, mean pore size 15 
μm) at the bottom of the reactor. A gas stream  outlet at the top of the reactor led to a 
thermal ozone destructor. Liquid samples were  collected with a sy ringe through a sealed 
port in the reactor. The ozone concentration at the gas inlet and outlet of the reactor were 
measured by redirecting the flows to a series of Drechsel flasks containing a 2% potassium 
iodide solution. 
High purity oxygen (99.999 %, BOC gases, UK) was fed to a silica drier to remove 
trace water prior to entering the ozone generator (OZOMAX 8Vtt, Ozomax, Canada) 
capable of producing up to 0.68 g ozone per minute. The hydrodynamic and operational conditions used in this study are summarised in Table 7.2 with the symbols presented in the nomenclature section.

Nine liters of winery wastewater were charged into the reactor and the degradation 
experiments were performed with continuous  ozone supply for various time periods. The 
water was re-circulated at a flow rate of 1 L per minute in order to improve the mixing of 
the liquid in the reactor, in addition to  the mixing provided by the gas bubbles. 
In the O 3/UV/H 2O2 process, the required amount of H 2O2 was added to the reactor 
as a single dose at time zer o in order to reach COD/H 2O2 ratios of 1, 1.3, 2 and 4. All 
samples withdrawn from the experiments involving H 2O2 were treated with a saturated 
solution of NaOH to quench the reaction of residual H 2O2 in the samples. 
Water samples were withdrawn regularly and analysed. The pH was monitored at 
regular intervals through the ozonation proce ss and, if required, it was controlled using 0.1 Chapter 7 – Application of O 3/UV and O 3/UV/H 2O2 processes to winery wastewater in a pilot bubble column reactor 
 
 
 
 146 M NaOH or 0.1 M H 2SO 4 solutions. All solutions and reagents were prepared in ultra-pure 
water, supplied by a NANOpure Diamond UV water purification system that provides 
bacteria free water w ith resistivity of 18.2 M Ω cm-1 or higher and TOC < 1 ppb. All of the 
oxidation experiments were performed in dup licate and the observed standard deviation 
was always less than 6% of the reported value.  
7.2.3 Analytical methods 
 
The organic matter in the samples was characterised in terms of COD  (HACH, 
model 45600 coupled with a colori meter HACH, ODYSSEY) and TOC  (Shimadzu TOC-
VCPH). The absorbance of sa mples was determined by a UV/Vis Spectrophotometer, UV 
mini 1240 Shimadzu. The Folin-Ciocalteau met hod, using gallic acid as a standard, was 
followed to evaluate the total polyphenols content in the samples (Singleton and Rossi, 1965). Hydrogen peroxide concentration in the samples was measured by means of 
Merckoquant Peroxide Test  strips (0-25 mg H
2O2 L-1). If required, the samples were 
diluted several times in order to achie ve an accurate measurement of the H 2O2 
concentration.  
7.3. Results and Discussions 
7.3.1. AOP comparison 
 
Experiments were carried out with UV radiation, ozone only, O 3/UV and 
O3/UV/H 2O2 at the natural pH of the winery wastew ater (pH = 4), in order to investigate 
the influence of each process on the rate of  COD removal. The pH  was not controlled by 
buffer during these oxidation experiments. Fi gure 7.2 presents the results achieved on 
COD reduction of winery wastewater and the co mparison of the four treatment processes. 
The direct photolytic  action of UV-C radiation on the co mpounds dissolved in the winery 
wastewater was insignificant. Ozonati on reduced the initia l COD by 12% and the 
combination of UV-C radiation and ozonatio n reached a COD removal of 21%, after 180 
minutes of reaction. An enhancement of the COD removal was achieved by adding 
hydrogen peroxide to the solution in the O 3/UV/H 2O2 process. With a COD/H 2O2 (w/w) 
ratio equal to 4, the COD removal was 35% after 180 min. The UV light intensity and ozone dose were kept constant in the above  experiments. The low COD reduction by the Chapter 7 – Application of O 3/UV and O 3/UV/H 2O2 processes to winery wastewater in a pilot bubble column reactor 
 
 
 147ozone alone process at pH 4 is due  to the fact that the ozone molecule is too stable at this 
acidic condition to produce reactive radical species. However, both the O 3/UV and 
O3/UV/H 2O2 processes were capable of oxidizing wi nery wastewater fa ster than ozone on 
its own showing a photochemical adding up oxidati on effect. This is principally due to the 
photolysis of ozone, the enhanced mass transf er of ozone and the generation of hydroxyl 
radicals that react rapidly with the organic ma tter in the winery wast ewater (Beltrán, 2003). 
The underlying chemistry is well known.

The photodecomposition of ozone by UV-C radiation leads to formation of H 2O2 and 
hydroxyl radicals as shown by the following reacti ons (Legrini et al., 1993; Litter, 2005): 
 
O3  +  H 2O  +  hν  →  H2O2  +  O 2      (7.1) 
O3 + H 2O2  →  HO 2• + •OH  +  O 2      k = 6.5 × 10-2 (M-1 s-1)  very slow (7.2) 
 
In addition, the photolysis of H 2O2 by UVC radiation yields  two hydroxyl radicals 
from each molecule of hydrogen peroxide:  
H
2O2 + hν → 2•OH        (7.3) 
 Chapter 7 – Application of O 3/UV and O 3/UV/H 2O2 processes to winery wastewater in a pilot bubble column reactor 
 
 
 
 148 In the presence of H 2O2 in addition to photolysis (7.3) the following equilibrium 
occurs:  
 
H2O2 + H 2O ↔ H3O+ + HO 2-  p K = 11.65    (7.4) 
 
Both ozone and hydrogen peroxide react w ith the hydroxyl radicals to form the 
peroxyl and the superoxide radical (7.5-7.6):  
•OH + O 3 → O2 + HO 2·    k = 1.1 × 108 (M-1 s-1)    (7.5) 
•OH + H 2O2 → O2• - + H 2O + H+  k = 2.7 × 107 (M-1 s-1)    (7.6) 
 which in turn they react further with th e hydroxyl radical and ozone in a propagation 
reaction scheme to yield hydroxyl radicals:   
•OH + O 2• - → OH-+ O 2    k = 1 × 1010 (M-1 s-1), pH = 7.9  (7.7) 
•OH + OH- → H2O + O• -  k = 1.3 × 1010 (M-1 s-1)     (7.8) 
O3 + O 2• - → O3• - + O 2   k = 1.6 × 109 (M-1 s-1)     (7.9) 
O3• - + H 2O →•OH  + OH- + O 2   k =  9.4 × 107 (s-1) at alkaline pH  (7.10) 
O3 + HO 2-→ O2• - + •OH + O 2    k = 5.5 × 106 (M-1 s-1)     (7.11) 
 
Hydroxyl, peroxyl and superoxide radi cal recombination (7.12-7.13) produce 
hydrogen peroxide which can be photolyzed again (7.3).

 149As the highest degradation capacity was showed by the O 3/UV and O 3/UV/H 2O2 
processes, the effects of the operational condi tions, such as, pH, initi al organic load (TOC) 
and hydrogen peroxide concentration COD/H 2O2 (w/w) ratio, were studied in the treatment 
of winery wastewater.   
7.3.2 Ozone/UV 
 
O3/UV experiments were carried out at the natural pH of the winery wastewater 
(pH = 4) and at two other initial pH, 7 and 10, in  order to investigate the effect of radical 
formation on the rate of COD removal. Figure 3 presents results of COD removal and pH 
evolution. The fastest COD removal was observed at pH 10 as a result of the fast reaction 
of the organic matter with the radical species (i.e., •OH , HO 2•, O 2•-, O 3•). At alkaline pH 
ozone self-decomposition to radica ls occurs as a result of th e initiation reaction (Tomiyasu 
et al., 1985): 
 
O3 + OH-
 → HO 2- + O 2   k = 40  (M-1 s-1) pH = 10  (7.16) 
 with a half life reported to be 20 s (Hoigne and Bader, 1976) (Figure 7.3a). In addition, the 
H
2O2 is deprotonated preferenti ally to water to give the hydroperoxide anion HO 2- which 
then reacts in a chain mechanism. However, once the pH reached values close to neutral and below (Figure 7.3b) the COD removal rates we re identical in the three experiments.  
During this stage the removal of COD was controlled by the generation of radical 
species by the reaction scheme presented above (in which reactions 7.4, 7.10, 7.11 and 
7.15 become less important). 
Figure 7.3b shows the evolution of pH for the above experiments. A slight decrease 
in pH from 4 to 3.7 was observed in the expe riments performed at the natural pH. A sharp 
decrease in the pH of wastewater was observed in the experiments with initial pH of 7 and 
10, and the final pH was 3.8 and 4.0, respectively, which indicates that a strong oxidation took place. The reduction in pH  is attributed to the form ation of dicarboxylic acids and 
small molecule organic acids, as well as, CO
2 and carbonic acids from total mineralization.  Chapter 7 – Application of O 3/UV and O 3/UV/H 2O2 processes to winery wastewater in a pilot bubble column reactor

7.3.3 Ozone/UV/H 2O2  
 
Experiments in the presence of ozone, UV radiation and hydrogen peroxide 
(O3/UV/H 2O2 process) were found to increase the de gradation of the organic matter in the 
winery wastewater further. Figure 7.4 shows th e effect of pH in the removal of COD as a 
function of reaction time and the pH evol ution during the experiments. The removal a)

 151efficiency is slightly higher at pH 10 ( 57%) than pH 4 (49%) and pH 7 (40%) after 300 
minutes. In the O 3/UV/H 2O2 process the production of hydr oxyl radicals by reaction (7.3) 
becomes highly significant due to the supplementary H 2O2 added to the solution, as well as 
reaction (7.6) under an excess of peroxide. In addition, th e reaction of ozone with H 2O2 
(7.2) also produce hydroxyl radi cals although at a slower rate.

experiments carried out in the absence of H 2O2, although the experiments at pH 10 showed a)

 152 a slower rate of pH decay, which also explain partially the faster rates observed with the 
O3/UV/H 2O2 in comparison to the other AOPs.   
 
7.3.4 Ozone consumption 
 
During the experiments the rate of ozone  consumption was monitored through the 
measurement of the ozone mass flow rate at the inlet and at the outlet of the reactor (Figure 
7.5). The mass flow rate at the reactor inlet was kept constant throughout each experiment. 
The difference between the values at the inlet and outlet of the reactor  defines the rate of 
ozone consumed within the reactor. This includes the contribution from the reaction of 
molecular ozone with the organic matter, and can also include the contribution from ozone 
decomposition at alkaline pH a nd ozone consumption by the hydrogen peroxide formed or 
added to the reactor.  
The evolution of the ozone mass flow rate at the reactor outlet of the bubble column 
reactor with the O 3/UV and O 3/UV/H 2O2 processes at different pH, is shown in Figure 7.5. 
In contrast with the results for ozonation al one presented in Lucas et al. (2009) a much 
higher rate of ozone consumption, in the region from 70-95% was observed in these 
experiments, suggesting a more effective us e of the ozone supplied to the system.

 153At pH 4, a lower rate was observed with O 3/UV compared to the O 3/UV/H 2O2 process as a 
result of lower contribution of reactions (7.2-7.4) since H 2O2 can only be produced by 
reaction (7.1) in the first instance and by radical recomb ination reactions (7.12-7.14).  
Conversely, at pH 7 and 10 ozone consumption was found to be very similar  
(> 85%) in both the O 3/UV and the O 3/UV/H 2O2 processes. However in the experiment at 
pH 10 with O 3/UV/H 2O2 a significant reduction of the ra te of ozone uptake was observed 
after 120 min, possibly due to the lower le vel of COD reached (Figure 7.4a) and the 
decomposition of H 2O2 (reaction 7.4) at al kaline conditions, which in turns reduces the 
amount of hydroxyl radicals formed by H 2O2 photolysis (reaction 7.3). 
 
7.3.5 Reaction kinetics 
 
A rigorous kinetic study of the ozonation of winery wastewaters is difficult to be 
performed due to the presence of multiple  and unknown reactions. However, COD and 
TOC can be used to describe the global kineti cs of organic matter removal and to derive 
the essential kinetic parameters needed for reactor design and optimisation (Preis et al., 
1988). The removal of COD form the winery wa stewater by the different AOPs was fitted 
by an apparent first-order rate equation. The pseudo-first order rate constants at pH 4, 7 
and 10 and the %TOC removed after 300 min ar e presented in Table 7.3. The removal of 
TOC was found to follow the trend of COD removal. The COD/TOC ratio was found to 
decrease during treatment other than in the experiments carried out in the presence of 
H2O2. The decrease of COD/TOC ratio in both the O 3 and the O 3/UV processes indicates 
the increase of the average oxidative state of  carbon in the organic in solution and lower 
reactivity toward ozone (Hsu et al., 2005). On the contrary, the increase in the COD/TOC 
ratio in the experiments carried out with the O 3/UV/H 2O2 process indicates either an 
increase of the H 2O2 concentration in solution as the reaction proceeds through radical 
recombination (reactions 7.12-7.14) and/or a de gradation pathways driven primarily by 
radical oxidation leading to different reaction intermediates. The rate constants and TOC removal with the O
3/UV/H 2O2 process were the highest, and significantly higher at pH 4 
(the natural pH of winery wa stewater) compared to the other AOPs. These results suggest 
the importance of combining ozone, UV radia tion and hydrogen peroxi de as a potential 
method for the treatment of winery wastewater.  Chapter 7 – Application of O 3/UV and O 3/UV/H 2O2 processes to winery wastewater in a pilot bubble column reactor

7.3.6 Effect of initial hydrogen pe roxide concentration and organic load 
 
Figure 7.6 shows the influence of hydrogen pe roxide concentration on the treatment 
of winery wastewater by the O 3/UV/H 2O2 process at pH 4, the na tural pH of the winery 
wastewater (Table 7.1). The COD/H 2O2 (w/w) ratio was varied: 1; 1.3; 2 and 4. It shows 
that almost complete mineralisation can be achieved (88% TOC removal) under optimised 
oxidant dose (COD/H 2O2 = 2). At COD/H 2O2 = 4 there is insufficient supplementary 
peroxide, at COD/H 2O2 = 1.3 the TOC removal is slightly lower than at the optimum 
COD/H 2O2 ratio, and at COD/H 2O2 = 1 there is excess peroxi de which scavenges hydroxyl 
radicals (reactions 7.6 and 7.15) . Figure 7.6 (inset) shows the apparent first-order rate 
constant of TOC removal to be si gnificantly affected by the COD/H 2O2 ratio. The highest 
rate constant (6.5x10-3 min-1 with COD/H 2O2 = 2) is six-fold higher than the rate constant 
with O 3 process alone. Chapter 7 – Application of O 3/UV and O 3/UV/H 2O2 processes to winery wastewater in a pilot bubble column reactor

7.3.7 Operating costs 
 
The adoption of the optimal treatment proc ess in the industrial environment would 
depend on favourable process economics. In the case of the AOPs studied, the process economics are primarily dependent on the costs of electricity (for oz one generation and to 
power the UV-lamp), in-situ oxygen generatio n to feed the ozone generator, UV lamp 
replacement, and added chemicals. An estim ation of the operating costs of the, O
3, O 3/UV 
and O 3/UV/H 2O2 processes based on the experiments ca rried out in the pilot-scale reactor 
was performed. The analysis exclude capital, maintenance, labour and depreciation costs 
since these will be common to  all AOPs investigated. Table 7.4 shows the costs for 
electricity, oxygen production, lamp replacement and H 2O2 to operate the pilot plant.

significant reduction of 25-56% and 80-86% in th e treatment costs were obtained with the

 158 7.4. Conclusions 
 
The overall results of this st udy carried out in a pilot- scale bubble column reactor 
indicate that the O 3/UV and O 3/UV/H 2O2 processes are feasible methods for the treatment 
of winery wastewaters. These processes, comparatively to UV radiation and ozonation 
alone at natural pH (pH 4), i nvolve the formation of highly reactive radicals in solutions 
resulting in faster degradation rates. O 3/UV and O 3/UV/H 2O2 allowed significant COD and 
TOC removals and reveal to be highly depe ndent on the initial pH of the wastewater.  
The rate of ozone consumption in the reactor was in the region from 70 – 95% 
during the experiments, suggesting an effective use of the ozone supplied to the system. In 
all the experiments the disappearance of the wi nery wastewater organi c load was described 
by pseudo-first order apparent r eaction kinetics useful for the design of industrial reactors. 
The faster rate constant (6.5 x 10-3 min-1), at the natural pH of the wastewater, was 
observed with the O 3/UV/H 2O2 under optimised oxidant dose (COD/H 2O2 = 2). Water 
dilution resulted in lower TOC removal rates. An economical analysis on the operating costs of the AOPs processes in vestigated revealed the O
3/UV/H 2O2 to be the most 
economical process (1.31 Euro m-3 g-1 of TOC mineralised unde r optimised conditions).

Abstract   
 
The degradation of the organic pollutants presen t in winery wastewater  was carried out by 
the combination of two successive steps: an aerobic biological process followed by a chemical oxidation process using Fenton’s reag ent. The main goal of this study was to 
evaluate the temporal charac teristics of solids and chemical oxygen demand (COD) present 
in winery wastewater in a long term aerat ed storage bioreactor.  The performance of 
different air dosage daily supplied to the biolog ic reactor, in laborat ory and pilot scale, 
were examined. The long term hydraulic retent ion time, 11 weeks, contributed remarkably 
to the reduction of COD (about 90%) and the comb ination with the Fenton’s reagent led to 
a high overall COD reduction that reached 99.5% when the mass ratio (R=H
2O2/COD) 
used was equal to 2.5, maintaini ng constant the molar ratio H 2O2/Fe2+=15.

 162 8.1. Introduction 
 
Wine production processes generate or ganic and inorganic pollution mostly 
associated with solid wastes and liquid effluents. The liquid  effluents usually referred as 
“winery wastewater” are mainly originated fr om various unit operations such as washing 
of the presses used to crush the grapes, ri nsing of fermentation va ts, rakings, barrels, 
bottles and other equipments or surfaces (Pirra, 2005; Mosteo et al. 2006).  
Winery wastewaters contain large amounts of  biodegradable organi cs in addition to 
relatively small concentrations of recalci trant compounds: polyphenols, organic acids and 
sugars with typical COD values in the range from 3 to 30 gL-1. The disposal of winery 
effluents in streams, creeks, rivers and on soils involves unacceptable environmental risks. 
Hence, a responsible management of thes e effluents requires that their potential 
environmental impacts be minimal and within an acceptable range (Petruccioli et al., 2000; 
Malandra et al., 2003; Beck et al., 2005; Lucas et al., 2009). 
Several physical and chemical processes are available to winery wastewater 
treatment but its major action is a phase transf er of pollutants. Biol ogical waste treatment 
methods have been recognized as a reasonable alternative way for a significant degradation 
of wastewater with high organic content, such  as those coming from wineries in particular. 
However, the presence of recalcitrant compounds for the microorganisms frequently makes impossible the complete treatment of a wine ry wastewater. Combination of biological 
treatment followed by chemical processes may pr ove useful in this situation (Beltran de 
Heredia et al., 2005; Lucas et  al., 2007). Biological treatm ent mineralizes the large 
biodegradable portion, effectively reducing the residual COD of the wastewater. A 
chemical polishing treatment (Fenton reagent) is then applied to degrade the persistent 
compounds. The primary biological step re duces the number and concentration of 
compounds that may compete for the chemical oxidant, thus increasing overall efficiency 
and lowering costs. 
Advanced Oxidation Processes offer a highly reactive, non-specific oxidant, 
namely hydroxyl radical (HO
•), capable of destroying a wide range of organic pollutants in 
water and wastewater (Legrini  et al., 1993; Nogueira et al ., 2005; Mosteo et al., 2007; 
Lucas et al., 2008). Fenton reagent is  a mixture of hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) solution and 
ferrous iron, which generates hydroxyl radicals  according to a comp lex mechanism in an 
aqueous solution that could be resumed by the following reaction: Chapter 8 – Winery wastewater treatment by a combined process: long term aerated storage and Fenton’s reagent 
 
 
 
 163Fe2+  +  H 2O2  →  Fe3+  +  HO-  +  HO•   (8.1) 
 
The ferrous ion initiates and cat alyses the decomposition of H 2O2, resulting in the 
generation of HO• (Chen and Pignatello, 1997; Feng et al., 2003).  
High-intensity aeration processes comm only require excessi ve energy input, 
leading to prohibitive operative cost. Therefore, it is important to seek a cost-effective treatment method. In this paper,  the main objective is to eval uate the capacity of treating 
winery wastewater in a long term biologic aera ted storage, with different aeration schemes, 
combined with Fenton’s reagent. This chemical oxidation process, that uses low-priced reactants, was used as a s econdary chemical treatment st ep for the oxidation of the 
recalcitrant organic compounds  or metabolites that could not be oxidized biologically. 
 
8.2 Material and methods 
8.2.1 Winery wastewater  
The original winery wastewater used in this study resulted from the mixture of 
different effluents collected from a Portuguese winery (Ade ga Cooperativa de Vila Real) 
located in the Douro region (northeast of Portugal), re presenting the total annual 
production of the winery. Table 8.1 summarizes  the average values obtained after two 
analyses for each parameter of the main physi co-chemical characteristics of the winery 
wastewater.

8.2.2 Chemicals 
 
The Fenton experiments were performe d using ferrous iron sulfate (FeSO 4.7H 2O), 
hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2, 30% w/w), sulphuric acid (H 2SO 4) and sodium hydroxide 
(NaOH) for pH adjustment all provided by Panreac. Other chemicals used in these Chapter 8 – Winery wastewater treatment by a combined process: long term aerated storage and Fenton’s reagent 
 
 
 164 experiments were of reagent grade and used as received. Ultra pure  distilled-deionised 
water obtained from a Milli- Q (Millipore Co.) system. 
 
8.2.3 Analytical determinations 
 
The COD, TSS, VSS, Nt, P and K were determined according to Standard Methods 
(APHA, 1992). COD analysis was done in  a COD reactor from HACH Co., and a HACH 
DR2010 spectrophotometer was used for colori metric measurement. Biological oxygen 
demand (BOD 5) was evaluated by the respirom etric method. In Fenton reagent 
experiments before the COD analysis, the samples were conditioned removing the H 2O2 
excess by addition of NaOH. Hydrogen peroxide  concentration was controlled during and 
after the treatments using Merck Peroxide Test (0 to 25 mg H 2O2/L and 0 to 100 mg 
H2O2/L). pH evolution was determined by m eans of a pH-meter (CRISON 507). Total 
polyphenols were evaluated by Folin-Ciocalteau method.  
8.2.4 Aerobic biodegradation 
 
The aerobic biodegradation experiments of winery wastewater were conducted in 
completely mixed biological batch reactors consisting of a 4 L cylindrical Pyrex glass 
(laboratory scale) and 60 L (pilot scale). Thes e vessels, at environmen tal temperature, were 
provided with covers containing inlets for bubbling the gas feed a nd stirring, and outlets 
for sampling and venting. The activated sludge used as inoculum of the aerated storage 
was directly obtained from aerobic stage of a full-scale urban wastewater treatment plant 
located nearby Vila Real (Portugal) and appl ied with a two days acclimatization period. 
The initial Volatile Suspended Solids (VSS) content of the sludge was 5 gL
-1. 
The air flow was fed to the reacting medium through a bubble gas sparger at a 
constant flow rate of 125 L h-1 at room conditions and with four different aeration periods 
2.4 h/day, 4 h/day, 8 h/day and 12 h/day. In this  process, the bioreactors were initially 
loaded with the above mentioned inoculum a nd the reaction medium was completed with a 
load of winery wastewater containing an initial substrate con centration around 20 g 
COD/L, and then the bioreactor was aerated an d stirred during an hydraulic retention time 
(HRT) of 11 weeks. During th e experiment several samples were withdrawn at regular 
times to analyze the COD, TSS, VS S and pH of the reacting medium. Chapter 8 – Winery wastewater treatment by a combined process: long term aerated storage and Fenton’s reagent 
 
 
 
 1658.2.5 Oxidation by Fenton’s reagent 
 
The winery wastewater from the biological  treatment (supernatant after natural 
sedimentation) was further treated using Fent on’s reagent. The oxida tion experiments were 
conducted in a 1 L stirred glass batch reactor. Typical experiments were carried out with 
500 mL of the effluent biologically pre-tr eated to which a weighed amount of FeSO 4·7H 2O 
was added and dissolved under stirring. pH wa s adjusted to 3.5 by adding sulphuric acid 
solution. The Fenton oxidat ion began with the addition of hydrogen peroxide solution 
(30% w/w). Different concentrations of H 2O2 and Fe2+ were tested. Before the 
determination of final COD the total consumption of H 2O2 was verified with Merckoquant 
strips.

laboratory scale experiments with biological treatment of a winery wastewater supplied with different aeration periods. 
 
The COD decreases rapidly in the ini tial 2 weeks during th e course of all 
experiments. The experiment performed with  an air supply of 12h/day achieves a high 
degradation level in a short reaction time,  for example after 4 weeks reaches a COD 
removal of 87%, while the 8h/day obtained 77 %, the 4h/day 76% and finally for 2.4h/day 
61%. 
However, since the 9th week it is possible to verify that COD removal is almost 
similar for all the experiments. For example, increasing the HRT to 11 weeks the COD removal percentage improves to a similar le vel for all experiment s and corresponding 
aeration periods. Therefore for 11 weeks reac tion and aeration time of 12h/day achieves a 
COD degradation of 88%, to 8h/day was obt ained 89%, for 4h/day 96% and to 2.4h/day 
95%. Thus, even for small aeration period, hi gh COD removal could be achieved with a Chapter 8 – Winery wastewater treatment by a combined process: long term aerated storage and Fenton’s reagent 
 
 
 
 167long aeration time. As a final analysis it is pos sible highlight that a gradual reduction of the 
substrate occurs during the 11 w eeks until it reaches a residual  value of non-biodegradable 
organic matter (among 5 and 10%). 
In addition to the experiments performed w ith different aeration periods, there were 
also performed experiments without any aerati on: with winery wastew ater plus inoculum 
(with sludge) and winery wast ewater without inoculum (wit hout sludge) to evaluate the 
influences of the aeration a nd of the inoculum sludge. The re sults reveal a less degradation 
capacity throughout the experime nt, though at the end they pr esented a similar depuration 
capacity. This means that in the experiment  without any inoculum added, the natural 
microorganisms present in the winery wastew ater showed the capacity to decompose the 
biodegradable organic matter. Another remark  is that without aeration the degradation 
reached is very similar to the assays with aeration. However, this situation produces 
harmful bad odours as result of the anaerobic biodegr adation. Therefore, experiments with 
aeration are always preferable even with sm all aeration times (e.g. 2.4h/day) to reduce 
these odours production.

The volatile solids fraction generally repres ents the organic component of the TSS, 
which is more biodegradable than the rest of solids that are mainly associated with the coarse material in the slurry and effectivel y inert in a typical aerobic treatment process 
(Figure 8.2). In all the experiments biomass achieves values different than zero after the Chapter 8 – Winery wastewater treatment by a combined process: long term aerated storage and Fenton’s reagent

scale. The pH is a key fact or on the microorganisms grow th, once they can not support 
values higher than 10 and less than 4. The expe riments started all at an acidic pH (among 4 
and 6). However, along the experiments the pH changes to basic values achieving the 
higher value at 9.6. This fact happens due to the adaptation and type of microorganisms 
naturally occurring along time, which clearly prefer higher pH values.

After the laboratory scale, experiment s were done at pilot scale. This  
scale-up was performed to evaluate if the beha viour showed at the laboratory scale (4L) 
would be similar to the observed in a 60 L pilot reactor. Figure 8.4 shows the COD 
removal results obtained in the pilot reactor . In general, these data reveal that, 
comparatively to lab scale data (Figure 8.1) the COD removal efficiency of the pilot scale 
is lower than the obtained at the laboratory scale.

 1718.3.2 Oxidation by Fenton’s reagent 
 
As described previously, winery wastewaters biodegraded by aerobic 
microorganisms were then treated with Fenton ’s reagent, in a group of experiments where 
the initial concentration of hydrogen peroxide  was modified, maintaining constant the 
molar ratio H 2O2/Fe2+=15. Table 8.2 presents the characte ristics of the winery wastewater 
after the biologic ae rated treatment.

Chemical oxidation with Fe nton’s process was analyzed in order to test further 
reduction in COD concentration to minimize the impact of winery wa stewater discharge on 
natural water courses and/or munici pal wastewater treatment plants. 
In the experiments carried out with Fenton reagent, they have had as reference the 
mass ratio between the hydrogen peroxide and COD, R = H 2O2/COD. Hence, the value of 
R was changed from 0.25 to 2.5, remaining cons tant the initial pH (c orrected after biologic 
treatment to 3.5), the initial temperatur e (30°C) and the molar ratio constant 
(H2O2/Fe2+=15) (Peres et al., 2004) evaluati ng mainly the final COD removal. 
Table 3 shows the COD removal at different  R values after 4 hours of experiment. 
From the data presented it is visible that COD removal increases from 17.4% to 93.2% when the R value (H
2O2/COD) increases from 0.25 to 2.5, respectively. 
As expected, the increase in H 2O2 concentration has a positive effect on the COD 
reduction. For the maximum R value studied (R = 2.5), the COD removal reaches 93.2% 
after 4 hours. This demonstrates the ability of  Fenton reagent to degrade a large part of 
recalcitrant organic matter present in winery wastewater. The reason for the increase in COD conversion with the increase of R is related to the gene ration of a greater amount of 
hydroxyl radicals and, therefor e, a greater extent of oxi dation reactions. One way to 
generally express the reacti on of the Fenton system (H
2O2 + Fe2+) to the reduction of COD 
can be summarized as follows:  Chapter 8 – Winery wastewater treatment by a combined process: long term aerated storage and Fenton’s reagent 
 
 
 172 Step 1:  
COD +  H 2O2  +   Fe2+     →     species partially oxidized     (8.3) 
 
Step 2:  
species partially oxidized  +  H 2O2  +  Fe2+  →  CO 2  +  H 2O  +  inorganic salts  (8.4) 
 
The extent of oxidation (and consequently  the degree of COD removal) depends 
directly on the amount of H 2O2 used.

8.4 Conclusions 
 
The combined process aerobic degradati on followed by Fenton’s reagent oxidation 
was employed to treat winery wastewater, leading to good performances. The results 
indicate that aerobic biological treatment reach es a very high COD removal, corresponding 
to the biodegradable fraction acting Fenton re agent like a final polishing step. The main 
conclusions are: aerobic bi ological degradation rates re aches among 76% and 96% COD 
removal in laboratory scale, and between 64% and 96% at pilot scale. It is preferable 
applying a biological process as a first treatmen t step of a winery wa stewater rather than 
chemical oxidation, since the most fraction of  the original effluent is biodegradable. Chapter 8 – Winery wastewater treatment by a combined process: long term aerated storage and Fenton’s reagent 
 
 
 
 173Depending of the discharge objectives and hurry, different aeration periods can be 
applied. Therefore, for small wineries, long term aerated storage can be performed (e.g. 
ponds, old cement vats, etc.) followed by a Fenton reagent treatment as a final polish with 
relatively low investment and operation costs. 
As a final remark, the results obtained star ting with a typical wi nery effluent (20 g 
COD/L) have demonstrated that this combin ed process (long term aeration plus Fenton 
reagent) can lead to COD removal efficiency hi gher than 99%, with final effluents that can 
be reused, rejected in the water streams or in the soil, according to the Portuguese law.

 175CHAPTER 9 - CONCLUSIONS AND SUGGESTIONS OF FUTURE WORK  
 
 
9.1 Conclusions 
 
The main conclusions of this thesis are divided in two sections; in the first one are 
mentioned those concerning the textile industr y wastewaters, where an azo dye (Reactive 
Black 5) was used as a model compound. In the second section are reported the main 
conclusions concerning a deep study about the treatment of wine ry wastewater with: 
Fenton’s reagent, photo-Fenton with so lar light (CPC reactor), heterogeneous 
photocatalysis (TiO 2), ozone, ozone/UV, ozone/UV/H 2O2 and the combination of aerobic 
biological processes with Fenton’s reagent.   Chapter 2 and 3
 
 
In a first stage was evaluated the Reactive Black 5  decolourization and 
mineralization capacity with two advanced photochemical proces ses: Fenton/UV-C and 
ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light. From the re sults it is possible conc lude that Fenton/UV-C and 
ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar light processes achieves a Reactive Black 5  decolourization higher 
than 90% in half an hour. It was found that the experiments w ith ferrioxalate follow a first 
order kinetic law even with UV-C or sola r light alone and with hydrogen peroxide 
addition. Although, when UV-C lamp + H 2O2 were employed the kinetic rate ( k) was 
higher comparatively to the solar light + H 2O2 combination, achieving, consequently, a 
minor half-life time ( t1/2). For both AOP, the optimal e xperimental conditions for a RB5 
concentration of 1.0x10-4 mol/L, are: pH=5, hydr ogen peroxide dosage = 1.5x10-3 mol/L 
and iron dosage = 1.5x10-4 mol/L. Besides the very similar decolourization in both 
processes, the employment of the UV lamp benefits the azo dye degradation. However, 
from the economical point of view the employ ment of the natural resource – solar light – 
could be an interesti ng option due to its low cost and the fact of being environmentally 
harmless. 
Further, an alternative option to decolourize dyed textile effluents was used 
sequentially an Advanced Oxidation Proces s (Fenton’s reagent) followed by an aerobic 
biological process (yeast C. oleophila ). Under our experime ntal conditions, a good Chapter 9 - Conclusions and suggestions of future work 
 
 
 176 treatment could be purposed as follows: Fenton’s reagent at 1.0x10-3 mol/L of H 2O2 and 
1.0x10-4 mol/L of Fe2+ as primary treatment and then i noculation with growing yeast cells 
as a secondary treatment. This combined proc ess allows removing about 91% of colour for 
an initial RB5 concentration of 500 mg/L. It should be pointed out th at Fenton’s reagent 
alone requires five times more H 2O2 and Fe2+ to achieve an identical level of colour 
removal. 
Therefore, the employment of AOP s like photo-Fenton and ferrioxalate/H 2O2/solar 
light could be an interesting wa y to treat coloured wastewater s like textile effluents. The 
combination of Fenton’s reagent with the Candida oleophila  yeast can be particularly 
useful especially in the treatment of high coloured wastewaters and also to reduce the 
operational treatment costs mainly asso ciated to the chemical processes. 
 Chapter 4
 
 
In the second part of this thesis are reported the main conclusions concerning the 
treatment of winery wastewaters. First, it wa s verified that photodegradation of the most 
representative phenolic compound present in the winery wast ewaters (gallic acid) using 
only monochromatic and polychromatic UV lamps,  can not be achieved in great extension. 
However, combining radiation with AOPs it is po ssible maximize the effect of the different 
radiation sources. From th e presented study it is possi ble to conclude that Fe2+ + H 2O2 + 
UV TNN 15/32 (photo-Fenton pr ocess) could be proposed as the best AOP for the 
degradation of gallic acid in aqueous solutions. Therefore, this work shows a possible treatment to remove or, at least, significantly diminish the problematic  phenolic fraction of 
winery wastewaters once decreases their concentration and toxicity.  
 Chapter 5
 
 
Afterwards, the application of heterogeneous photocatalysis (TiO 2, TiO 2/H2O2, 
TiO 2/Na 2S2O8) and homogeneous photocatalysis (phot o-Fenton) to winery wastewaters 
were performed in a CPC reactor. It was verified that applying heterogeneous 
photocatalysis to a simulated winery wastewater  reveals to be inefficient on TOC removal, 
achieving in the best situation a TOC degradation of 25%. Using homogeneous 
photocatalysis, solar photo-Fent on process, have shown that  it can be reached a TOC Chapter 9 - Conclusions and suggestions of future work 
 
 
 
 177removal efficiency of 46% with a simulated wastewater carried out with wine (WV) and 
93% with grape juice (WG) in a t 30W of 400 minutes. Mixing WV w ith WG in a ratio 50:50 
a TOC removal of 90% was achieved for a t 30W of 150 minutes.  
Further, if an air stripping process is pr eviously applied for ethanol removal from 
the winery wastewater mixture (WW), a TOC de gradation of 96% is obtained. Besides this 
high TOC degradation a significan t detoxification occurs, given the fact that the toxicity 
level decreases from 48% to 28%, as well as almost total elimination of the total polyphenols (92%).  Chapter 6
 
 
Another AOP tested with winery wastew aters was ozone. The application of 
ozonation in a pilot-scale bubble column react or was proven to be effective in the 
degradation of organic substances present in winery wastewater . The degradation of 
aromatics and polyphenols content was found to be significantly faster than the decrease in 
COD. This suggests that ozonation may be considered as pre-treatment to further 
biological treatment. The degrad ation rate of organic matter and aromatics increases at 
alkaline pH, however, polyphenol s are more efficiently remove d at acidic pH. At alkaline 
and neutral pH the degradation rate was accel erated by the formation of radical species 
from the decomposition of ozone, however, the observed kinetics was limited by mass 
transfer at the gas-liquid interface.  
Monitoring of pH, ORP and the rate of oz one consumption gave insights into the 
prevalent kinetic regimes during the ozonation process. The reaction was found to develop 
in and across different kinetic regimes: fast, moderate and slow kinetic regime depending 
on the experimental conditions. As a result, beside the use of bubble columns (large bulk 
volume) which are recommende d for gas-liquid reactions in the slow kinetic regime 
(reaction in the bulk liquid), other gas-liquid ozonation contact ors that offer large contact 
surface area to volume ratios may be considered if the reaction develops predominantly in the fast or moderate kinetic regime  (reaction at the ga s-liquid interface). 
A kinetic model of the ozonation proce ss occurring in the semi-batch bubble 
column reactor was presented and was coupled w ith a second order irreversible reaction of 
ozone with the dissolved organic matter. Th e dynamic change of the rate coefficient 
estimated by the model was correlated with changes in the water composition and oxidant Chapter 9 - Conclusions and suggestions of future work 
 
 
 178 species. The model presented and the rate coe fficient determined can be used for design 
and scale-up of ozonation bubble columns for the treatment of winery wastewater under 
similar experimental conditions as in this work.  Chapter 7
 
 
The next step of the work was evaluate , in the same pilot-scale bubble column 
reactor used in chapter 6, the feasibility of O 3/UV and O 3/UV/H 2O2 processes treat winery 
wastewaters. These processes, comparativ ely to UV radiation an d ozonation alone at 
natural pH (pH 4), involve the formation of hi ghly reactive radicals in solutions resulting 
in faster degradation rates. O 3/UV and O 3/UV/H 2O2 allowed significant COD and TOC 
removals and reveal to be high ly dependent on the initial pH of the wastewater. The rate of 
ozone consumption in the reactor was in the region from 70 – 95% during the experiments, 
suggesting an effective use of the ozone supplie d to the system. In al l the experiments the 
disappearance of the winery wastewater orga nic load was describe d by pseudo-first order 
apparent reaction kinetics useful for the de sign of industrial reacto rs. The faster rate 
constant (6.5x10-3 min-1), at the natural pH of the wastewater, was observed with the 
O3/UV/H 2O2 under optimised oxidant dose (COD/H 2O2 = 2). Water dilution resulted in 
lower TOC removal rates. An economical an alysis on the operating costs of the AOPs 
processes investigated revealed the O 3UV/H 2O2 to be the most economical process (1.31 
Euro m-3 g-1 of TOC mineralised under  optimised conditions). 
 Chapter 8
 
 
The final component of this work presents the combinati on of an aerobic biological 
process followed by Fenton’s reagent oxidation to treat a winery wastewater. The results 
indicate that aerobic biological treatment reach es a very high COD removal, corresponding 
to the biodegradable fraction, acting Fenton reagent as a fi nal polishing step. It is 
preferable applying a biological process as a first treatment step of a winery wastewater 
rather than chemical oxidation once the main fraction of the original effluent is biodegradable. 
Depending of the discharge objectives, diffe rent aeration periods can be applied. 
Therefore, for small wineries, long term aer ated storage can be pe rformed (e.g. ponds, old Chapter 9 - Conclusions and suggestions of future work 
 
 
 
 179cement vats, etc.) followed by a Fenton’s reag ent treatment for final polish. The results 
obtained starting with a typical winery effluent (20 g COD/L) have demonstrated that this 
combined process (long term aeration plus Fenton reagent) can lead to COD removal 
efficiency higher than 99%, with final effluent s that can be reused, rejected in the water 
streams or in the soil, according to the Portuguese law.  
As final comment, it is possible say that th e treatment of winery wastewaters largely 
depends of the initial wastewaters organic lo ad and of the reaching goals. Therefore, the 
selection of an appropriated treatment proce ss depends of local and economical variables 
that should be object of a deep analysis between the technician proposal and the cellar 
owners.   
9.2 Suggestions of future work 
 
Several topics related to the above treatment processes remain to be explored. Thus, in 
this page are mentioned future research developments that can be followed in a near opportunity:  
Textile wastewaters: 
 
• Evaluate textile wastewaters treatme nt by photo-Fenton and ferrioxalate/H
2O2 with 
solar radiation in a CPC reactor; 
• Application of Fenton’s reag ent process followed by the Candida oleophila  yeast to 
real textile wastewaters. 
 
Winery wastewaters: 
 
• Test the degradation of or ganic compounds present in wi nery wastewaters (such as 
tannins, antocianins, phe nolic acids) by AOPs; 
• Treatment of winery wastewaters by ferrioxalate/H 2O2 in a CPC reactor; 
• Combine an aerobic biological treatmen t with photo-Fenton system in a CPC 
reactor; Chapter 9 - Conclusions and suggestions of future work 
 
 
 180 • Assess the ozone/H 2O2 system to the treatment of winery wastewaters; 
• Combine ozonation with biological treatment . As ozonation reveals to be efficient 
in removing the phenolic conten t present in winery wastewaters in the first reaction 
minutes, the application of a further bi ologic process could be feasible and 
economically interesting. 
 
Finally, an economical analys is and a life cycle assessm ent of all th e treatment 
processes studied either with textile or winery wastewaters could be made. These analyses 
will assess the economical and environmenta l impacts of a treatment process over the 
entire life cycle “from cradle to grave”.  Publications related with this work
