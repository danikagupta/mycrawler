Serotonin syndrome:
Preventing, recognizing, and treating it
With a substantial increase in antide-
pressant use in the United States over the 
last 2 decades, serotonin syndrome has become an increasingly common and signifi  cant clini-
cal concern. In 1999, 6.5% of adults age 18 and older were taking antidepressants; by 2010, the percentage had increased to 10.4%.
1 Though 
the true incidence of serotonin syndrome is dif-fi cult to determine, the number of ingestions of 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) associated with moderate to major effects re-ported to US poison control centers increased from 7,349 in 2002
2 to 8,585 in 2005.3
 Though the clinical manifestations are of-ten mild to moderate, patients with serotonin syndrome can deteriorate rapidly and require intensive care. Unlike neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome should not be considered an extremely rare idiosyncratic re-action to medication, but rather a progression of serotonergic toxicity based on increasing concentration levels that can occur in any pa-tient regardless of age.

 Because it has a nonspecifi  c prodrome and 
protean manifestations, serotonin syndrome can easily be overlooked, misdiagnosed, or ex-acerbated if not carefully assessed. Diagnosis requires a low threshold for suspicion and a meticulous history and physical examination. In the syndrome’s mildest stage, symptoms are often misattributed to other causes, and in its most severe form, it can easily be mistaken for neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

As the use of serotonergic agents to treat depression 
has increased, so too has the incidence of serotonin syndrome. We identify the common agents implicated in serotonin syndrome and the clinical tools to diagnose, manage, and prevent serotonergic toxicity.
KEY POINTS
Serotonin syndrome is caused by elevated serotonin lev-els in the central and peripheral nervous systems. 
The classic presentation is the triad of autonomic dys-
function, neuromuscular excitation, and altered mental status. These symptoms vary based on the severity of serotonergic toxicity and often do not present concomi-tantly. 
Early recognition is critical to ensure appropriate resusci-
tative measures and to limit further use of drugs that can exacerbate symptoms.VISHAL VASHISTHA, MD

rotonin levels affecting the central and pe-
ripheral nervous systems. Serotonin affects a family of receptors that has seven members, of which 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A are most often responsible for serotonin syndrome.

 Conditions that can alter the regulation of serotonin include therapeutic doses, drug in-teractions, intentional or unintentional over-doses, and overlapping transitions between medications. As a result, drugs that have been associated with serotonin syndrome can be classifi  ed into the following fi  ve categories as 
shown below and in Table 1: Drugs that decrease serotonin break-
down include monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), linezolid,
6 methylene blue, procar-
bazine, and Syrian rue. Drugs that decrease serotonin reup-
take include SSRIs, serotonin-norepineph-rine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants, opioids (meperidine, bu-prenorphine, tramadol, tapentadol, dextro-methorphan), antiepileptics (carbamazepine, valproate), and antiemetics (ondansetron, granisetron, metoclopramide), and the herbal preparation St. John’s wort. Drugs that increase serotonin precursors 
or agonists include tryptophan, lithium, fen-tanyl, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Drugs that increase serotonin release in-TABLE 1

agents listed above are CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors, eg, erythromycin,

 However, the only drugs that have been reliably confi  rmed to precipitate serotonin 
syndrome are MAOIs, SSRIs, SNRIs, and serotonin releasers. Other listed drug interac-tions are based on case reports and have not been thoroughly evaluated.
6–9 
 Currently, SSRIs are the most commonly prescribed antidepressant medications and, consequently, they are the ones most often implicated in serotonergic toxicity.
1,10 An es-
timated 15% of SSRI overdoses lead to mild or moderate serotonin toxicity.
11 Serotonergic 
agents used in conjunction can increase the risk for severe serotonin syndrome; an SSRI and an MAOI in combination poses the great-est risk.
5 
 Ultimately, the incidence of serotonin syn-drome is diffi  cult to assess, but it is believed to 
be underreported because it is easy to misdiag-nose and mild symptoms may be dismissed. 
 ■WHO IS AT RISK OF SERO
TONIN SYNDROME?
Long-term antidepressant use has dispropor-tionately increased in middle-aged and older adults and non-Hispanic whites.
1,12,13 Intui-
tively, as the risk for depression increases dra-matically in patients with chronic medical conditions, serotonin syndrome should be more prevalent among the elderly. In addi-tion, patients with multiple comorbidities take more medications, increasing the risk of polypharmacy and adverse drug reactions.
14 
 Although the epidemiology of serotonin syndrome has yet to be extensively studied, the combination of age and comorbidities may increase the risk for this condition.
 ■HOW DOES IT PRESENT?
Serotonin syndrome characteristically pres-ents as the triad of autonomic dysfunction, neuromuscular excitation, and altered mental status. However
, these symptoms may not oc-
cur simultaneously: autonomic dysfunction is present in 40% of patients, neuromuscular ex-citation in 50%, and altered mental status in 40%.
15 The symptoms can range from mild to 
life-threatening (Table 2).16
 Autonomic dysfunction. Diaphoresis is 
present in 48.8% of cases, tachycardia in 44%, nausea and vomiting in 26.8%, and mydriasis in 19.5%. Other signs are hyperactive bowel sounds, diarrhea, and fl  ushing.
16
 Neuromuscular excitation. Myoclonus is 
present in 48.8%, hyperrefl  exia in 41%, hy-
perthermia in 26.8%, and hypertonicity and Serotonin 
syndrome can easilybe overlooked, misdiagnosed, or exacerbated if not carefully assessedTABLE 2

Severe
serotonin toxicity is a life-threatening condition that can lead to multiorgan failure within hoursrigidity in 19.5%. Other signs are spontaneous 
or inducible clonus, ocular clonus (continuous rhythmic oscillations of gaze), and tremor. Altered mental status. Confusion is pres-
ent in 41.2% and agitation in 36.5%. Other signs are anxiety, lethargy, and coma. Symptoms of serotonin toxicity arise with-in an hour of a precipitating event (eg, inges-tion) in approximately 28% of patients, and within 6 hours in 61%.
16 Highly diagnostic 
features include hyperrefl  exia and induced or 
spontaneous clonus that are generally more pronounced in the lower limbs.
11 Clonus can 
be elicited with ankle dorsifl  exion.
 In mild toxicity, patients may present 
with tremor or twitching and anxiety, as well as with hyperrefl  exia, tachycardia, diaphore-sis, and mydriasis. Further investigation may uncover a recently initiated antidepressant or a cold-and-cough medication that contains dextromethorphan.
15,17
 In moderate toxicity, patients present in 
signifi  cant distress, with agitation and rest-lessness. Features may include hyperrefl  exia and clonus of the lower extremities, opsoc-lonus, hyperactive bowel sounds, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, mydriasis, and hyperthermia (< 40°C, 104°F). The patient’s history may re-veal use of ecstasy or combined treatment with serotonin-potentiating agents such as an antidepressant with a proserotonergic opi-oid, antiepileptic, or CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor.
15
 Severe serotonin toxicity is a life-threat-
ening condition that can lead to multiorgan failure within hours. It can be characterized by muscle rigidity, which can cause the body temperature to elevate rapidly to over 40°C. This hypertonicity can mask the classic and diagnostic signs of hyperrefl  exia and clonus. 
Patients may have unstable and dynamic vital 
signs with confusion or delirium and can ex-
perience tonic-clonic seizures. 
 If the muscle rigidity and resulting hyper-
thermia are not managed properly, patients can develop cellular damage and enzyme dysfunction leading to rhabdomyolysis, myo-globinuria, renal failure, metabolic acidosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and dis-seminated intravascular coagulation.
16,18 
 Serotonin crisis is usually caused by the co-ingestion of multiple serotonergic agents, such as an antidepressant with an aforementioned opioid and antiemetic
19; combining an SSRI 
and an MAOI poses the greatest risk. Alter-
natively, patients may have recently switched antidepressants without observing a safe wash-Currently on serotonergic agent

levels.16
 ■HOW DO WE DIAGNOSE SEROTONIN SYNDROME?
Serotonin syndrome is a clinical diagnosis and therefore requires a thorough review of medications and physical examination. Serum serotonin levels are an unreliable indicator of toxicity and do not correlate well with the clinical presentation.
16 
 Currently, there are two clinical tools for diagnosing serotonin syndrome: the Hunter serotonin toxicity criteria (Figure 1) and the Sternbach criteria.  The Hunter criteria are based more heav-
ily on physical fi  ndings. The patient must 
have taken a serotonergic agent and have one 
of the following:• Spontaneous clonus• Inducible clonus plus agitation or diapho-
resis
• Ocular clonus plus agitation or diaphoresis• Inducible clonus or ocular clonus, plus hy-pertonia and hyperthermia
• Tremor plus hyperrefl  exia.
 The Sternbach criteria. The patient must 
be using a serotonergic agent, must have no 
other causes of symptoms, must not have re-cently used a neuroleptic agent, and must have three of the following: • Mental status changes• Agitation• Hyperrefl  exia
• Myoclonus
• Diaphoresis• Shivering• Tremor• Diarrhea• Incoordination • Fever. The Hunter criteria are recommended and are more specifi  c (97% vs 96%) and more 
sensitive (84% vs 75%) than the Sternbach criteria when compared with the gold stan-dard of diagnosis by a clinical toxicologist.
1 
The Hunter criteria are also less likely to yield 
false-positive results.11The Hunter 
criteria are more sensitive and speciﬁ  c 
than the Sternbach criteriaTABLE 3

Mainstays of 
management: stop the serotonergic agent and give supportive careDifferential diagnosis
The differential diagnosis for serotonin syn-drome includes neuroleptic malignant syn-drome, anticholinergic poisoning (Table 3), 
metastatic carcinoma, central nervous system infection, gastroenteritis, and sepsis. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, the 
disorder most often misdiagnosed as serotonin 
syndrome, is an idiosyncratic reaction to a do-pamine antagonist (eg, haloperidol, fl  uphen-
azine) that develops over days to weeks.
20 In 
70% of patients, agitated delirium with confu-
sion appears fi  rst, followed by lead pipe rigidity 
and cogwheel tremor, then hyperthermia with 
body temperature greater than 40°C, and fi  -
nally, profuse diaphoresis, tachycardia, hyper-tension, and tachypnea.
21 
 Key elements that distinguish neuroleptic malignant syndrome are the timeline of the clinical course, bradyrefl  exia, and the absence 
of clonus. Prodromal symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are also rare in neuro-leptic malignant syndrome. Neuroleptic ma-lignant syndrome typically requires an average of 9 days to resolve. Anticholinergic poisoning usually de-
velops within 1 to 2 hours of oral ingestion. 
Symptoms include fl  ushing, anhidrosis, anhi-
drotic hyperthermia, mydriasis, urinary reten-tion, decreased bowel sounds, agitated deliri-um, and visual hallucinations. In contrast to serotonin syndrome, refl  exes and muscle tone 
are normal with anticholinergic poisoning.
 ■HOW CAN WE TREAT 
SERO
TONIN SYNDROME?
The two mainstays of serotonin syndrome management are to discontinue the seroto-nergic agent and to give supportive care. Most patients improve within 24 hours of stopping the precipitating drug and starting therapy.
16
 For mild serotonin syndrome, treatment 
involves discontinuing the offending agent and supportive therapy with intravenous fl  u-
ids, correction of vital signs, and symptom-
atic treatment with a benzodiazepine. Patients should be admitted and observed for 12 to 24 hours to prevent exacerbation. For moderate serotonin syndrome, treat-
ment also involves stopping the serotonergic agent and giving supportive care. Symptom-atic treatment with a benzodiazepine and 
nonserotonergic antiemetics is recommended, and standard cooling measures should be im-plemented for hyperthermia. Patients should be admitted and observed for 12 to 24 hours to prevent exacerbation. For severe serotonin toxicity, treat-
ment should focus on management of airway, breathing, and circulation—ie, the “ABCs.” The two primary life-threatening concerns are hyperthermia (temperature > 40°C or 104°F) and rigidity, which can lead to hypoventila-tion.
1,22 Controlling hyperthermia and rigid-
ity can prevent other grave complications. Patients with severe serotonin toxicity should be sedated, paralyzed, and intubated.
21 This 
will reverse ventilatory hypertonia and allow for mechanical ventilation. Paralysis will also prevent the exacerbation of hyperthermia, which is caused by muscle rigidity. Antipyret-ics have no role in the treatment of serotonin syndrome since the hyperthermia is not caused by a change in the hypothalamic temperature set point.
21 Standard cooling measures should 
be used to manage hyperthermia.
Serotonin antagonists
Serotonin antagonists have had some success in case reports, but further studies are needed to confi  rm this.
4,23,24 
 Cyproheptadine is a potent 5-HT2A an-
tagonist; patients usually respond within 1 to 2 hours of administration. Signs and symp-toms have resolved completely within times ranging from 20 minutes to 48 hours, depend-ing on the severity of toxicity.  The recommended initial dose of cypro-heptadine is 12 mg, followed by 2 mg every 2 hours if symptoms continue.
16 Maintenance 
dosing with 8 mg every 6 hours should be pre-scribed once stabilization is achieved. The to-tal daily dose for adults should not exceed 0.5 mg/kg/day. Cyproheptadine is available only in oral form but can be crushed and adminis-tered via a nasogastric tube.
21
 Chlorpromazine is a 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A 
antagonist and can be given intramuscularly. Despite case reports citing its effectiveness, the risk of hypotension, dystonic reactions, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome may make it a less desirable option.

serotonin receptor antagonists require further 
investigation beyond individual case reports to determine their effectiveness and reliability in treating serotonin syndrome.
Other agents
Benzodiazepines are considered a mainstay for 
symptomatic relief because of their anxiolytic and muscle relaxant effects.
26 However, animal 
studies showed that treatment with benzodiaz-
epines attenuated hyperthermia but had no ef-fect on time to recovery or outcome.
27
 Neuromuscular blocking agents. The 
suggested neuromuscular blocking agent for 
severe toxicity is a nondepolarizing agent such as vecuronium. Succinylcholine should be avoided, as it can exacerbate rhabdomyolysis and hyperkalemia.
21
 Dantrolene has also been suggested for its muscle-relaxing effects and use in malignant hyperthermia. However, this treatment has not been successful in isolated case reports and has been ineffective in animal models.
4,28
 Physical restraints are ill-advised, since 
isometric muscle contractions can exacerbate hyperthermia and lactic acidosis in agitated patients.
21 If physical restraints are necessary 
to deliver medications, they should be re-moved as soon as possible.
 ■HOW CAN WE PREVENT 
SERO
TONIN SYNDROME?
Prevention of serotonin syndrome begins 
with improving education and awareness in patients and healthcare providers. Patients should be primarily concerned with taking their medications carefully as prescribed and recognizing early signs and symptoms of sero-tonin toxicity. As use of antidepressants among an ag-
ing population continues to increase, and as physicians in multiple disciplines prescribe them for evolving indications (eg, duloxetine to treat osteoarthritis, diabetic neuropathy, fi bromyalgia, and chemotherapy-induced pe-
ripheral neuropathy), healthcare providers 
need to be prepared to see more cases of sero-tonin syndrome and its deleterious effects.
29–31 
Physicians should be vigilant in minimizing unnecessary use of serotonergic agents and re-viewing drug regimens regularly to limit poly-pharmacy.  Electronic ordering systems should be de-signed to detect and alert the prescriber to possible interactions that can potentiate se-rotonin syndrome, and to not place the or-der until the prescriber overrides the alert. Combinations of SSRIs and MAOIs have the highest risk for inducing severe serotonin syn-drome and should always be avoided.  If a patient is transitioning between se-rotonergic agents, physicians should observe a safe washout period to prevent overlap.
16,32 
Washout periods may differ among medica-
tions depending on their half-lives. For exam-ple, sertraline has a washout period of 2 weeks, while fl  uoxetine requires a washout period of 5 
to 6 weeks.
33 Consulting a pharmacist may be 
helpful when considering half-lives and wash-out periods. We believe that educating both patients and physicians regarding prevention will help minimize the risk for serotonergic syndrome and will improve effi  ciency in assessment and 
management should toxicity develop.

between serotonergic agents, observe a safe washout period
