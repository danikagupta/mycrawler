ABSTRACT  
 
This study aimed at developing sensitive competitive enzyme -linked immunosorbent assays 
(ELISAs) for the banned Sudan dyes, using polyclonal antibodies. Three different formats were 
developed and characterized in terms of sensitivity, selectivity and rapidity. A competitive indirect 
ELISA was developed, which showed an IC 50 of 3.8 µg L-1. Two competitive direct ELISAs, were 
also developed, which differ in the fact that the antibody is added before or simultaneously with the 
other reagents; the first showed an IC 50 of 8.3 µg L-1 and the second one showed an IC 50 of 4.9  µg 
L-1. Nevertheless, considering dilution of extracts which is needed to offset matrix interference, the 
limits of detection of the three formats were substantially the same (10 µg kg-1). The antibodies in 
all three test formats were able to recognize Su dan I and partially Sudan II, III, and IV; no cross -
reactivity was observed with five edible dyes. Twenty food samples, including chilli powder, 
paprika, ketchup, and egg, were extracted by simple sample preparation and very limited dilution. 
Extracts were  analyzed by the developed competitive direct ELISA with the simultaneous addition of reagents. A good correlation was observed ( y=1.19 x-10.0, r2 = 0.991, n=20) when the data was 
compared with that obtained through conventional HPLC method.  
 
KEYWORDS: Suda n dyes, ELISA, chilli powder, egg yolk  
 INTRODUCTION  
Sudan I, II, II and IV (Figure 1) are non -ionic fat -soluble dyes used as additives in gasoline, grease, 
oils, plastics, pri nting inks, and floor polishes (Mejia E . et al., 2007)  These dyes are classifie d by 
the International Agency for research on Cancer as category 3 carcinogens to humans (IARC, 
1975) , and the use of Sudan I in foodstuffs is forbidden in global food regulation acts (EC 
Regulation No 178/2002, Di Donna L. et al., 2004) . Unfortunately, th ey are still illegally utilized to 
intensify and maintain the colour of food products such as chilli -, curry -, and palm oil -containing 
foodstuffs. From May 2003, warnings against chilli powder from Asia and a variety of foodstuffs 
polluted by Sudan dyes we re issued throughout Europe (Han D. et al., 2007)  and, more recently, 
Sudan I was found in China in various commercial foodstuffs, including chilli sauce, meat and eggs 
(He L. et al., 2007) . This illegal use of Sudan dyes is a severe danger to public healt h, therefore 
simple, rapid and reliable analytical methods for the determination of these banned dyes in 
foodstuffs are required, as also testified by the large number of papers concerning the development 
of extraction and detection methods for Sudan dyes in food (particularly, in chilli powder) which 
was published in 2007. The vast majority of described analytical methods are based on high 
performance liquid chromatography, with optical or mass spectrometric detection (Di Donna L. et 
al, 2004; Ma M et al, 2006; Cornet V. et al., 2006; Mazzetti M. et al., 2004) , however, some gas 
chromatographic and capillary electrophoresis methods have also been reported (Mejia E. et al., 
2007; He L. et al., 2007) . Generally, chromatographic methods are expensive and time -consuming, 
therefore other techniques for detecting Sudan dyes have been developed. Among these, Deng and 
co-authors . described the first enzyme immunoassay (Han D. et al., 2007)  and applied it to the 
detection of Sudan I in some food samples (tomato sauce  and juice, chilli sauce and powder). They 
prepared two hapten derivatives with different lengths of carboxylic spacers and used them to 
synthesize the immunogen and the coating antigen. The optimized indirect competitive ELISA 
showed itself to be sensitiv e and specific for Sudan I. However, when applied to samples, limits of 
detection were in the mg/kg range, which is dramatically higher than the detection capability of the chromatographic methods, mainly because of the need for diluting the sample extract s from 1:100 
to 1:1000 before analysis, in order to offset the matrix effect.  Very recently, the preparation of a 
monoclonal antibody towards Sudan I, III and Para red and its use in the development of a sensitive 
competitive indirect ELISA has been descri bed (Ju C. et al, 2008). The determination of Sudan I in 
eggs by an immunoassay exploiting the resonance scattering of gold nanoparticles has also been 
reported (Jiang Z. et al, 2008). Nevertheless, the extraction of the dye from eggs requires a two -day 
protocol.  
In this study, a Sudan I hapten derivative was synthesized, with the objective of raising a polyclonal 
antibody characterized by low selectivity towards other three Sudan dyes (II, III, and IV) to develop 
a competitive immunoassay able to detect th e entire group of banned Sudan dyes. Different assay 
formats were compared: a direct and an indirect competitive ELISA were developed, and the 
simultaneous or subsequent addition of reagents was evaluated. Moreover, the extraction step and 
the solvent used  to dissolve Sudan dyes were optimized with the aim of minimizing matrix 
interference without the contemporary need for an excessive dilution of extracts.  
The developed assay was validated through comparison with an HPLC -UV method  and proven to 
allow  the determination of Sudan dyes in  very different foodstuffs (chilli powder, ketchup and egg 
yolk).  
 
MATERIALS AND METHOD S 
Materials  
All Sudan dyes, 4 -aminobenzoic acid, 2 -naphthol, bovine serum albumin (BSA), goat anti -rabbit 
immunoglobulin HRP -labelled antib ody, horse -radish peroxidase (HRP) N,N’ -
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), N -hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), and 3,3’5,5’ -
tetramethylbenzidine liquid substrate (TMB) were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, 
USA).  
Sephadex G -25 resin and low chromatography  apparatus were from GE Healthcare (Milan, Italy)  Dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), acetonitrile (HPLC grade) and all other 
chemicals and microtiter plates were obtained from VWR International (Milan, Italy).  
Polyclonal antibodies (ammoni um sulphate precipitated IgG fraction) were obtained from Davids 
Biotechnologie (Germany).  Antibodies were prepared using the standard immunization protocol 
(Davids Biotechnologie, Germany) and sera were collected after 70 days from the first injection.  
Sudan dye stock solutions were prepared by dissolving the powders in chloroform and immediately 
diluting them in acetonitrile to the final concentration of 20 mg L-1. Standard solutions were 
prepared by daily diluting the stock solutions with DMSO:water (10: 90, v/v).  
 
Synthesis of hapten and hapten -protein conjugates  
The hapten used for immunization, antigen coating and enzyme labelling is depicted in Figure 1. 
Carboxy -Sudan I (CSudan I) was synthesized as previously reported  (Ju C. et al, 2008) . 
CSudan I was  then conjugated with BSA and HRP by the DCC/NHS ester method, as reported in 
the literature (Hosoda H. et al., 1979) . Briefly, equimolar amounts of CSudan I, DCC and NHS 
were dissolved in anhydrous DMF and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for  1 hour. 
Proper amounts of the mixture were then added to protein solutions prepared in 0.13 M NaHCO 3, to 
obtain a final molar ratio of 50:1; 100:1; 200:1 (CSudan I:BSA), 20:1; and 10:1 (CSudan I:HRP). 
BSA conjugates were incubated overnight at room temper ature, while HRP conjugates were reacted 
for 1 hour at room temperature. Separation of conjugates from by -products and the excess of 
reagents was carried out by gel filtration low pressure chromatography on Sephadex G -25 resin 
(mobile phase: phosphate buff er).  
Finally, sodium azide was added to BSA conjugates, which were stored at -18°C. The 200:1 
conjugate was used as the immunogen, while conjugates with lower substitution degree were used 
as coating antigens. HRP conjugates were stored at 4°C, with 33% ( v/v) of glycerol added.  
 
Competitive indirect ELISA  Wells were coated with 200 µl of 0.2 mg L-1 CSudan I -BSA (50:1) in a carbonate -bicarbonate 
buffer (50 mM pH 9.6). The plates were incubated overnight at 4°C. After the plates were washed 
three times with  washing solution (0.05% Tween 20), 300 µl of blocking solution (phosphate 
buffer, containing 0.1% BSA, 5% sucrose, and 4% polyvinylpyrrolidone) was added to each well 
and the plates were further incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were wa shed and 
they were either used immediately or stored at 4°C until use.  
Antiserum was diluted 1:30000 (v/v) in 20  mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, containing 1% (p/v) of 
BSA (PBSA). A volume of 100 µl of diluted antiserum was added to 100 µl of Sudan I at 
concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 ng L-1 and incubated in coated wells for 15 minutes. After 3 
well washes with washing solution 200 µl of a diluted goat -antirabbit immunoglobulin conjugated 
to horseradish peroxidase was used to detect the immobilized rab bit antibody. The incubation time 
was 30 minutes, followed by three well washes. Colour development was obtained by a 30 min 
incubation with TMB (200 µl per well). One hundred microlitres of sulphuric acid (1M) was used 
as a stop solution and absorbance wa s recorded at 450 nm.  All standards and samples were 
measured in duplicate.  
 
Competitive direct ELISA (simultaneous addition of reagents)  
The immunoreactive solid phase was obtained by coating wells with 300 µl of a goat -antirabbit IgG 
solution (10 mg L-1) (Giraudi G. et al., 2000) .  
Antiserum and CSudan I –HRP were diluted in PBSA. A volume of 100 µl of diluted antiserum 
(1:15000, v/v) was added to 50 µl of 0.75 mg L-1 of CSudan I -HRP (20:1) and to 50 µl of Sudan I at 
concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 μg L-1. The mixture was incubated 15 minute in 
immunoreactive wells. Then the wells were washed with washing solution. Colour development and 
absorbance readings were obtained as described above.  
 
Competitive direct ELISA (pre -immobilization of the antibo dy)  The same immunoreactive solid phase used for the format with the simultaneous addition of 
reagents was used in this case. In addition, 200 µl of diluted antiserum (1:50000, v/v) in PBSA was 
incubated overnight at 4°C. After the plates were washed thre e times with washing solution, they 
were used immediately.  
A volume of 100 µl of CSudan I -HRP (20:1) at 0.2 mg L-1 was added to 100 µl of Sudan I at 
concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 μg L-1. The mixture was incubated for 15 minutes in wells 
coated with the anti -Sudan I antibody, then wells were washed with washing solution. Colour 
development and absorbance readings were obtained as described above.  
 
Calculations  
Sudan I concentration s were determined by interpolation on the calibration curve, where the signal 
was plotted against the log of analyte concentration. For each experiment, a calibration curve was 
determined by a nonlinear regression analysis of the data of the standards usin g the four -parameter 
logistic equation (Findlay J et al., 2000) . 
Relative cross -reactivity was calculated as follows:  
CR% = (IC 50 Sudan I / IC 50 Sudan dye)*100  
where IC50 is the Sudan dye concentration which cause 50% inhibition of the maximum observed 
signal. 
 
Samples and sample preparation  
The following commercial samples: 5 kinds of ketchup, 5 kinds of eggs, 10 kinds of chilli powder 
and paprika were purchased in large stores. One sample for each category that did not show any 
detectable residues of targ et dyes when analyzed by HPLC was taken as the blank for matrix 
interference experiment and fortification experiments. Fortified samples were prepared by adding 
25, 125, and 625 µg kg-1 of Sudan I and 125, 625 µg kg-1 of Sudan II, III, and IV to a blank sa mple 
before performing the extraction.  Sudan dye extraction was carried out as reported in the literature (Ma M. et al., 2006)  with slight 
modifications. Egg yolk was manually separated and gently mixed before extractions. Briefly, 20 g 
of homogenized samp le were weighed and sonicated for 15  min with 50 ml of DMSO. Egg yolk 
and ketchup samples were previously mixed with 20 g of sodium sulphate to eliminate water. After 
being centrifuged for 15  min at 3000 rpm, extracts were diluted at 1:10 with PBSA and fil tered 
through a 0.45 µm nylon membrane filter. Based on our experience, the use of a nylon membrane is 
mandatory to eliminate matrix interference from chilli powder and paprika samples.  
 
HPLC analysis  
To evaluate the accuracy and to validate the method, a comparative study using both the developed 
ELISA method and a HPLC reference procedure (Thompson M. et al. 2002)  was performed. 
Samples were extracted as described above, except for the fact that DMSO extracts were diluted 1:5 
(v:v) with the same solvent a nd filtered through a 0.45 µm nylon membrane filter, according to the 
literature (Ma M. et al., 2006) .  
Each extract was injected in triplicate. A liquid chromatographic system (LaChrom Elite, VWR -
Hitachi, Darmstadt, Germany) equipped with a C -18 Chromolit h Performance 100 -4.6 mm column 
(VWR, Darmstadt,Germany) was used. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and water at a 
volume ratio of 80:20, delivered to the column at a rate of 1 ml min-1. Detection was made by a UV 
detector (472 nm). Sudan I conce ntrations were calculated by interpolation on an external 
calibration curve.  
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSI ON 
Production of polyclonal antibodies  
Two rabbit antisera were raised against CSudan I -BSA (200:1). These were tested by a non -
competitive indirect ELISA, fo llowing the protocol described in the experimental section, with the 
difference that no Sudan I was added. Both antisera show very similar performance (Figure 1) and high titres on the coating antigen (IC 50 at 1:80 000 and 1: 100 000, v/v, antibody dilution  for rabbit 1 
and 2 respectively). The non -specific binding of antisera towards the carrier protein was also 
evaluated, but resulted negligible in comparison with the binding towards the hapten (Figure 1).  
Arbitrarily, rabbit 1 antiserum was used for this study.  
 
Competitive indirect ELISA  
Checkerboard assays, in which antiserum was titrated against varying amounts of two coating 
antigens (CSudan I -BSA 100:1 and CSudan I -BSA 50:1), were used to select appropriate antigen 
coating and antibody dilutions for t he competitive indirect assay. An antibody diluted at 1:30000 
(v/v) and the coating antigen CSudan -BSA 50:1 at 0.2 mg L-1 were selected as the most suitable on 
the basis of the IC 50 value that was the lowest.  
Since Sudan dyes are very hydrophobic compounds , they should be dissolved and kept in some 
organic solvent. A rapid literature review permitted us to identify a wide variety of solvents used to 
dissolve and extract Sudan dyes from food samples for determination by chromatographic 
techniques (Mejia E. e t al, 2007; Ma M. et al., 2006; Cornet V. et al., 2006; Mazzetti M. et al., 
2004) . The application as the analyte solvent in immunochemical methods of analysis narrowed the 
field, but acetonitrile and dimethylsulfoxide, remained as possible candidates. Eve n if DMSO is 
rarely associated with ELISA measurement, both organic solvents were considered as the Sudan 
diluent to set up the standard curve. Solvent effect on the developed assay performance was studied 
by diluting the Sudan I standard solution in PBSA/ DMSO and PBSA/acetonitrile (5, 10 and 20%, 
v/v) and carrying out the standard curve in the optimized condition. Low amounts of acetonitrile 
(below 10%) allowed an increase in the absolute signal to be observed, but was associated with 
limited detectability  (IC 50 above 20 µg L-1). On the contrary, the presence of DMSO (below 10%) 
lowered the signal of the blank, but allowed us to reach decidedly higher sensitivity (IC 50 below 10 
µg L-1). The increase of the organic solvent amount from 5 to 10% produced a par allel doubling of 
the IC 50 value, whereas when the solvent percentage was increased up to 20%, the IC 50 increased more dramatically. Finally, 10% (v/v) of DMSO in PBSA was chosen as the solvent to prepare the 
dilute Sudan I standards. The time of incubatio n for the competitive reaction was then optimized 
and 15 minutes was selected as a satisfying compromise between the lowest IC 50 and a blank signal 
around 1 -1.5 UA. Figure 3 shows a typical inhibition curve obtained under optimized conditions. 
The IC 50 value of the assay was 4 µg L-1 with a detection limit of 0.2 µg L-1 and a dynamic range of 
0.4-100 µg L-1. 
 
Competitive direct ELISA  
Competition experiments were carried out under various combinations of antibody and enzyme 
tracer concentrations. Two formats  were optimized: the first involving the simultaneous reaction 
between antibody, tracer and analyte (dissolved in 10% DMSO) and a second one, which was based 
on a long pre -immobilization reaction of the antibody, followed by a short incubation of the mixtu re 
of the analyte and the tracer into functionalized wells. Figure 3 shows typical inhibition curves 
obtained under optimized conditions.  
Antibody dilutions, enzyme tracer concentrations and incubation times are summarized in Table 1, 
together with the ana lytical performance of the optimized assay in both formats. As expected, the 
pre-immobilization of the antibody allowed the use of lower amounts of antibody and competitor 
(the enzyme tracer) and consequently the improvement of assay sensitivity (lower IC 50 value). 
Nevertheless, the preparation of functionalized wells by the pre -immobilization of the antibody 
involves overnight incubation before carrying out the assay or the stabilization of functionalized 
wells.  
 
Selectivity of the assays  
Since, from a leg al point of view, the occurrence of all four Sudan dyes (I -IV) should be assessed in 
food, the assay would be virtually able to cross -react with the four target analytes. To assess the 
influence of the assay format on the selectivity, cross -reactivity towa rds Sudan II has been measured by the three developed assay formats. The manipulation of the format of the 
immunoassay slightly influences the selectivity: the competitive direct ELISA with the pre -
immobilized antibody is the most selective assay (CR%=26%) , whereas the other two formats show 
about the same selectivity (CR%=34% for the direct assay and 35% for the indirect ELISA).  
Since the format finally chosen to validate the method was the direct ELISA with the simultaneous 
addition of reagents, a more e xtensive study of selectivity was made using this assay format. 
Results reported in Table 2 show that Sudan II is well recognized. Sudan III and IV and other Sudan 
dyes demonstrate a slight recognition, which means that the assay would be able to measure t hese 
compounds only at levels ten -times higher than Sudan I. This finding is not very far from the 
performance obtained by some instrumental methods of analysis based on chromatographic or 
electrophoretic determination of Sudan dyes (Mejia E. et al., 2007;  Ma M. et al., 2006) . 
Several dyes, whose use is permitted in food (Department of Food Biosciences, University of 
Reading, UK ), were also tested for cross -reactivity. The interference with the assay was negligible 
for all tested compounds.  
 
Better choice o f format and its validation  
To evaluate matrix interference on the three developed assays, blank samples of chilli powder, 
ketchup and egg yolk were analyzed in six replicates. Negligible interference was observed when 
extracts were analyzed by means of th e direct ELISA format with the simultaneous addition of 
reagents. The other two formats needed a simple 1/2 (v/v) dilution of samples with the PBSA 
containing 10% of DMSO before the analysis to offset the matrix effect.  
The LOD was calculated by interpolat ion on the Sudan I standard curve as the analyte concentration 
corresponding to the mean signal of the zero standard  (obtained by averaging the signal of eight 
replicate sets) minus three times its standard deviation (according to IUPAC, ISO, and AOAC 
harm onized guidelines) (Thompson M. et al , 2002)  and it was 0.2 µg L-1 for both the indirect and 
the direct ELISA with the pre -immobilization of the antibody. The direct ELISA with the simultaneous addition of reagents had lower sensitivity (calculated LOD 0.4  µg L-1). This result can 
be simply explained by remembering that in the direct ELISA (with the simultaneous addition of 
reagents) standards and samples are diluted 1/4 (v/v) in wells, while in the other two formats they 
are diluted 1/2. For the same reaso n, no further dilution was required to offset matrix interference in 
the direct ELISA with the simultaneous addition of reagents. On the contrary, the other two formats 
required an additional 1/2 (v/v) dilution, before analysis. Consequently, in the end, t he limits of 
detection of the three developed formats, compared to the solid sample, were substantially the same 
(10 µg kg-1). 
Therefore, the direct competitive ELISA with the simultaneous addition of reagents, being rapid, 
sensitive and the easiest to car ry out was chosen as the format to be fully validated.  
The LOD, re -calculated for each different matrix by measuring and averaging data from the five 
blank samples, confirmed the previous estimation (10 μg kg-1) as regards ketchup and chilli powder.  
The pr ecision of the method was determined by extracting and analyzing replicates of Sudan I 
artificially contaminated samples (ketchup, chilli powder), which were fortified with a Sudan I 
concentration of 25 (low level), 125 (medium level), and 625 (high level)  µg kg-1.  
The assay was carried out in six replicates on the day for the evaluation of within -assay precision 
and on six different days for the evaluation of the between -assay precision. The values of RSD% 
were calculated at each nominal concentration lev el and ranged from 2 to 16%, which fulfilled FDA 
requirements for the validation of bioanalytical methods according to FDA guidance (Viswanathan 
C. et al., 2007) . 
To evaluate the accuracy of the method, chilli powder and ketchup samples fortified with Suda n I 
(concentrations of 25, 125, and 625 µg kg-1), Sudan II, Sudan III, and Sudan IV (concentrations of 
125 and 625 µg kg-1) were extracted and analyzed. Results are summarized in Table 3. Recovery 
values ranged from 70 to 103% for Sudan I, thus indicating a good accuracy of the assay when 
applied to real samples of very different compositions. Recovery values for Sudan II, III, and IV reflect their cross -reactivity and confirm that these dyes could be only detected in highly 
contaminated samples.  
Fortificat ion experiments were also conducted on egg yolk samples. This matrix has not been 
included in the work of Ma M. et al. (2006) , thus no information regarding the possibility of 
extracting Sudan dyes from this kind of sample by means of the same protocol app lied to other 
matrices was available.  To our knowledge, this is also the first time that Sudan I has been measured 
via an immunoenzymatic method in egg yolk. Therefore, a blank sample of egg yolk was fortified 
with 25, 250 and 2500 µg kg-1 of Sudan I and e xtracted in triplicate according to the procedure 
described in the experimental section. Samples were analyzed both by the developed direct ELISA 
method and by HPLC and the obtained recovery values for both methods are reported in Table 4. 
The fortified sa mple at the lowest concentration could only be measured by means of the ELISA. 
The medium and high level fortified samples gave satisfactory recoveries and good agreement 
between the results obtained via the two methods. Generally speaking, the developed E LISA 
showed an increased imprecision of data, in comparison with fortification experiments made on 
samples belonging to different classes (chilli powder, paprika and ketchup), even if the relative 
standard deviation remained in the range considered accepta ble for screening methods 
(Viswanathan C. et al., 2007) . The LOD was, in this case, higher than for other considered matrices 
(15 µg kg-1), due to the greater data imprecision.  
 
Comparison of ELISA and HPLC determination  
A total of 20 samples (representat ive for all categories previously indicated) were analyzed with the 
developed direct competitive ELISA method. Since no positive samples were found in the market, 
they were randomly fortified with Sudan I at different levels of contamination (from 50 to 25 00 µg 
kg-1) and blindly analyzed by the two methods.  
Agreeing results were obtained via the two methods: the linear regression analysis (Figure 4) 
yielded a good correlation between the methods ( y=1.19 x-10.0, r2 = 0.991, n=20). A limited under -estimation o f the Sudan I concentration was observed at high contamination levels (above 500 µg 
kg-1), probably due to the low solubility of the analyte when diluted 1/10 in the PBSA for the 
analysis. In fact, if the two highest fortified samples are not included in t he comparison between 
ELISA and HPLC, the agreement between methods further improves ( y=1.09 x-1.24, r2 = 0.995, 
n=18). Thus, very highly contaminated samples, which can occur in the case of the illegal use of 
Sudan dyes (Mazzetti M. et al, 2004) , should be  diluted in DMSO before diluting them in PBSA, in 
order to prevent Sudan I precipitation and low recoveries.  
These results proved that the developed ELISA can be applied as screening methods for the 
detection of Sudan I in foodstuffs of very different kin ds, with good accuracy and precision. The 
assay is really sensitive, because sample extracts need a very limited dilution before being analyzed; 
therefore LOD in samples remains in the ten µg kg-1 range. In addition, the method is simple, rapid 
(the extrac tion requires 30 minutes, and the assay is completed in 45 minutes), and applicable to 
very different matrices with very slight modifications, thus proving itself to be suitable as a first 
level screening method or for routine quality controls of various f oodstuffs.
