 Abstract  
In the present paper adsorption technique was emp loyed for removal of Congo -Red dye . Congo -
Red dye is a carcinogenic dye which comes in the effluents of textile industries during dyeing 
and rinsing processes . The adsorption of Congo red from solution was carried out using  low cost 
adsorbents like coconut  (Cocos nucifera ) shell extract and bael (Aegle marmelos ) fruit extract 
with different contact times, temperatures,  and pHs . .2 gm of adsorbent was taken in the dye 
solution for the adsorption process. The Taguchi experimental design method was applied for  the 
systematic and effective investigation to determine the optimal conditions of the operation 
variables. In case of coconut it was observed that pH is the main factor for determining the rate 
of adsorption while in case of bael extract it was found to b e time and bael showed 
characteristics of being an endothermic adsorbent.

 1. INTRODUCTION  
The introduction of waste products in the environment is a world wide problem that has been 
highlighted by various environmentalist groups. Dyes are widely used in industries such as 
textiles, rubber, paper, plastics, cosmetics, etc., to colour their products. The dyes are invariably 
left as the major waste in these industries. Due to their chemical structures, dyes are resistant to 
fading on exposure to ligh t, water and many chemicals and, therefore, are difficult to be 
decolourised once released into the aquatic environment  (Sharma et al ,2008 ).  Many of the 
organic dyes are hazardous and may affect aquatic life and even the food chain (sheikh et al , 
2009 ). Release of these dyes in water stream is aesthetically undesirable and has serious 
environmental impact. Due to intense color they reduce sunlight transmission into water hence 
affecting aquatic plants, which ultimately disturb aquatic ecosystem; in additio n they are toxic to 
humans also.  
 congo red dye (1 - Naphthalenesulfonic acid, 3, 3' -(4, 4' biphenylene bis (azo) bis 4 -amino) di 
sodium salt) is a benzedene based dye, known to metabolize to benzedene, a known human 
carcinogen and can also cause allergic dermatitis and skin irritation. The release and 
accumulation of dyes in suspension solution form in inland waters from tanneries, textile, paper 
and other industries produce tremendous chemico -azo stress on aquatic organism including 
fishes and some time r esults in their mass mortality. The removal of dyes from industrial waste 
before they are discharged into the water bodies is therefore very important from health and 
hygiene point of view and for environmental protection.  
 
Methods for treating textile dy e wastewaters consist of various chemical, physical and biological 
processes . These include: adsorption ( Bilal  et al.,  2004 ), nanofiltration ( Chakraborty  et al.,  2003 ; 
Capara  et   al.,  2007 ), colloidal gas aphrons ( Roy et al.,  1992 ), ultrasonic decomposition 
(Jiantuan  et al.,  2003 ), electro coagulation ( Alinsafi  et al.,  2004 ), coagulation and precipitation 
(Liu et al.,  2003 ), advanced chemical oxidation ( Arslan et al.,  2000 ), electrochemical oxidation 
(Torres  et al.,  2010 ), photo -oxidation ( Patricia  et al.,  2003 ), predispersed solvent extraction 
(Mahmoud  et al.,  2007 ), ozonation ( Mohammed  et al.,  2007 ), supported liquid membrane 
(Mahmoud  et al.,  2007 ) and liquid -liquid extraction ( Venkateswaran  et al.,2005 ) .

 Natural materials that are avail able in abundance, or certain waste products from industrial or 
agricultural operations, may have great potential as an inexpensive sorbents. Due to their low 
cost, after these materials have been expended, they can be disposed of without expensive 
regener ation. The abundance and availability of agricultural by -products make them good 
sources of raw materials for activated carbons. Many carbonaceous materials such as bark, coal, 
lignite, coconut shells, wood, dead biomass, seaweed, pecan shell and peat are used in the 
production of commercial activated carbons.  
The adsorption process has been widely used for colour removal. Adsorption is one of the 
processes, which besides being widely used for dye removal also has wide applicability in 
wastewater treatment.  This process being very low cost method and most simple method for 
containing these pollutants is being used in this study. The main objectives of this study were to 
determine the effectiveness and feasibility of some low cost agricultural waste materials  (coconut 
shell and bael extracts) in the removal of congo red dye. The study included investigation of 
effect of Hydrogen ion concentration (pH), contact time and temp of experimental conditions.

 2. LITERATURE REVIEW  
Color is the first contaminant to be recognized in wastewater and has to be removed before 
discharging into water bodies or on land. The removal of color from wastewater is often more 
important than the removal of the  soluble colorless organic substances, which usually contribute 
the major fraction of the biochemical oxygen demand. Color is the first contaminant to be 
recognized in wastewater and has to be removed before discharging into water bodies or on land. 
The re moval of color from wastewater is often more important than the removal of the soluble 
colorless organic substances, which usually contribute the major fraction of the biochemical 
oxygen demand. Many methods have been reported for removing textile dyes fro m wastewater, 
among which are membrane filtration, coagulation/flocculation, precipitation, flotation, 
adsorption, ion exchange, ion pair extraction, ultrasonic, mineralization, electrolysis, advanced  
Oxidation and chemical reduction. Biological techniques  include bacterial and fungal biosorption 
and biodegradation in aerobic, anaerobic or combined anaerobic/aerobic treatment processes. 
The use of one individual process may often not be sufficient to achieve complete decolorization.  
Also the economic condit ion of the process must be taken into account as we can ’t spend a lot of 
money in clearing. So an economic method is also required.  
Abdul  et al. , (2002)  studied removal of dye from waste water of textile industry using membrane 
technology. With the fabrica tion of a suitable experimental rig, the effect of dye concentration, 
dye pH, and operating pressure were studied. Data on the flux and rejection together with the 
average values for each of the parameters studied were presented systematically. The results  
show that the dye concentration, pH of dye, and the operating pressure was found to affect the 
filtration process.  
Sharma et al. , (2008)  studied removal of congo red dye from the effluents of textile industry 
using rice husk carbon activated by steam. The adsorbent was made from rice husk and was 
investigated under variable system parameters such as agitation time and dose of adsorbent. An 
amount of 0.08 g/l of RHCAS could remove 10 to 99 % of the dye from an aqueous solution of 
25 ppm with the agitation t ime increasing from 20 min to 200 min. The interactions were tested 
for both pseudo first - order and second – order kinetics and it was observed that the interactions 
could be better explained on the basis of first order kinetics.    
Bilal Acemio˘glu  (2003)  studied Adsorption of Congo red from aqueous solution onto calcium -
rich fly ash with different contact times , concentrations, temperatures, and pHs The adsorption  
4 
 was between 93 and 98% under the conditions studied. Kinetic studies showed that the 
adsorpt ion process obeyed the pseudo -second -order kinetic model From thermodynamic studies, 
he observed  that the adsorption was spontaneous and endothermic. Desorption  studies suggested 
that desorption was 29.18% in the presence of 0.1 N HCl and was 47.21% in the  presence of 
CH3COOH (50% v/v).  This indicated that most of the dye was held by fly ash via chemisorption 
as well as ion exchange . 
Senthilkumaar  et al., (2005) studied Adsorption of dissolved Reac tive red dye from aqueous 
phase onto activated carbon prepar ed from agricultural waste  i.e. Coconut tree flower carbon  
and Jute fibre carbon Quantitative removal of Reactive red dye was achieved at strongly acidic 
conditions for both the carbons studied. The overall rate of dye adsorption appeared to be 
controlled  by chemisorption, in this case in accordance with poor desorption studies  
Chatterjee et al. , (2006)  studied removal of congo red by chitosan hydrobeads.  Adsorption 
process has been found to be dependant on temperature with optimum activity at 30 ◦C. Both  
ionic interaction as well as physical forces is responsible for binding of congo red with chitosan . 
Mittal  et al., (2009) studied removal of Congo red  from wastewater using waste materials  like 
bottom ash and deoiled soya and recovery by desorption . Column operations depicted good 
adsorptive tendencies for Congo red with 96.95% and 97.14% saturation of dye on bottom ash 
and deoiled soya, respectively. Regeneration of the saturated columns has been made by eluting 
NaOH solution and more than 90% dye ha s been recovered in both cases . 
Bhattacharyya et al., (2004) attempted removal of congo red from solutions using Azadirachta 
indica leaf powder  (neem leaf) as adsorbant.  An amount of 0.6 g of the Neem leaf powder (NLP) 
per litre could remove 52.0 –99.0% of the dye from an aqueous solution of concentration 2.87 £ 
1022 mmol l21 with the agitation time increasing from 60 to 300 min . The results point to the 
effectiveness of the Neem leaf powder as a biosorbent for  removing dyes like Congo Red from 
wate r. 
Kamel et al.  (2009) decoloured  congo red dye soln by direct UV photolysis at 254 nm and at pH 
6.6 of the solution. It has been observed, that decolouration process of Congo red solutions, 
became slow when concentration increased in the medium for the lo west concentration (10 ppm), 
about 70% of dye decolourization was reached after 7 h of irradiation. Improvement of this 
process was obtained when systems like H 2O2/UV and S 2O82- /UV were used.

 Khadhraoui  et al . (2009 ) investigated the degradation and miner alization of Congo red, in 
aqueous solutions using ozone Phytotoxicity and the inhibitory effects on the microbial activity 
ofthe raw and the ozonated solutions were also carried out with the aim  of water reuse and 
environment protection . From his experiment he concluded that ozone by itself is strong enough 
to decolorize these aqueous solutions in t he early stage of the oxidation process . 
Hoda et al. ( 2006 ) studied removal of acid dyes(Acid Blue 45, Acid Blue 92, Acid Blue 120 and 
Acid Blu e 129) from aqueous solutions by adsorption onto activated carbon cloth. It was found 
that the adsorption process of these dyes onto ACC follows the pseudo -second -order model . 
Vimonses a et al.  (2009 ) performed  Kinetic study and equilibrium isotherm analysi s of Congo 
Red adsorption by clay materials (bentonite, kaolin and zeolite) . Thermodynamic investigations 
showed that the adsorption is an exot hermic and spontaneous process. Sodium bentonite 
demonstrated the best adsorptive capacity followed by kaolin cla y, and they can be employed as 
low-cost alternatives for recalcitrant dye removal from industrial wastewate r. 
Yuzhu  et al. ( 2002 ) investigated removal of Congo red, from an aqueous solution bybiosorption 
on dead fungus, Aspergillus niger  Pretreatment with NaHCO 3 was found to be the most  
effective with a b iosorption capacity of 14.72 mg/g compared with 12.10 mg/ g of living biomass 
for Congo Red. The initial pH of the dye solution strongly affected the chemistry of bo th the dye 
molecules an d fungal biomass in an aqueous solution .This study sho wed that it is possible to 
develop systems for dye removal using A. niger biomass which occurs as a byproduct in waste 
streams of fermentation industries.  
Tor et al. ( 2006 ) studied removal of congo red  (CR) anionic dye, from water by using the acid 
activa ted red mud in batch adsorption experiments . They observed t he pH of the  dye solution 
strongly affected the chemistry of both the dye molecules and activated red mud in an aqueous 
solution . 
Zhenhu  et al. (2010 ) attempted removal of congo red dye using cattail root as adsorbent  Removal 
efficiency increased with increase of cattail root dosage and ionic strength, but decreased with 
increase of temperature revealing that the removal of CR from aqueous  solut ion by cattail root 
was a spontaneous and exothermic adsorption process . 
Namasivayam et al. (2002 ) Removal of Congo Re d from water by adsorption onto activated 
carbon prepared from coir pith, an agricultural solid waste. The adsorption capacity was found t o  
6 
 be 6.7 mg  dye per g of the adsorbent. Acidic pH was favourable for the adsorption of Congo 
Red. Desorption studies suggest that chemisorption might be the major mode of adsorption . 
Purkait  et al. ( 2007 )attempted Removal of congo red using activated carbon and its regeneration 
The zero point of charge of the activated carbon is found about 6.6. About 90% dye is removed 
for initial concentration of 50 and 100 mg/L, it is about 80% at pH 7.0. Maximum adsorption 
(about  100%) of dye is observed at pH 2.0 for the concentration range studied here . 
Mohan et al. (2002)studied removal of dyes from waste water using flyash as adsorbent .They 
found that adsorption increased with increase in temp which indicated that the process  was 
endothermic in nature.

3.1 Adsorbate  
Congo red, is an anionic azo dye having IUPAC name as 1 -napthalenesulfonic acid, 3,3-(4,4-
biphenylenebis(azo))bis(4 -aminodisodium) . Its stock solution was prepared in double -distilled 
water. All the test solutions were prepared by diluting the stock with double - distilled water.

1gm of Congo red was dissolved in 1L of double distilled water to obtain stock solution. Later it 
was diluted by using distilled water according to the concentration required and pH was adjusted 
by adding .1 M NaOH soln and .1 M HCl soln according to the conditions

 3.2 Adsorbent  
Both adsorbent materials, used in the present research work, are waste materials and available 
easily and abundantly i.e. Coconut  (Cocos nucifera) shell and bael( Aegle marmelos ) fruit extracts 
used in this experiment were obtained from local sources. The w aste materials were washed with 
tap water to remove soil and dust, sprayed with distilled water, and dried to a constant weight at   
105  C. These extracts were grounded and sieved to obtain particle sizes of 0.25 –0.40mm as 
adsorbent, and then stored in d esiccators for use.  
 
3.3 Batch Adsorption Study  
The batch adso rption was carried in 250 ml Borosil conical flasks by mixing a pre -weighed 
amount of the adsorbent  with 100 ml of aqueous dye solution of a particular concentration. The 
conical flasks were kept on a magnetic shaker and were agitated for a pre -determined time 
interval at a constant speed. The system parameter such as adsorbent amount, agitation time an d 
temperature were controlled during the experiments. After adsorption was over, the mixture was 
allowed to settle for 10 min. The dye remaining unadsorbed was determined 
spectrophotometrically. The adsorption experiments were carried out under the followi ng 
conditions:  
 Initial conc. of congo red solution (ppm):  100 ppm  
 Amount of adsorbent (gm/l):  0.2 gms  
 PH 2 , 7 , 12  
 Agitation time (min.):              5 mins,  100 mins , 300 mins  
 Temperature  400C , 500C , 600C 
 
3.4 Adsorption Studies  
Experiments were performed to study the effects of important parameters such as effect of 
Temperature, amount of adsorbent, time of contact and pH. For this, 50 m l of dye solutions was 
taken in 250 m l airtight volumetric flasks with .2 gm of adsorbents. The flasks were the n 
subjected to intermittent shaking for proper adsorption. After the fixed time of contact these 
solutions were filtered with filter  (whatman filter size 0.45µm PES filter media ) and the amount 
of the dye adsorbed was analyzed at λ max 498 nm. In order to d etermine the uptake of the dye, an 
entire set of experiments was performed at different time of contact (5, 100 and 300 mins),  
9 
 temperatures (40, 50, and 60  C) and pH (2, 7, 12) etc. for both adsorbent materials. The amount 
of Congo red  uptake by coconut shell extract and bael extract after each experiment was 
measured  was calculated using the following  equation:

where q is the amount of congo red adsorbed by adsorbents (mg /g); C 0 and C e are the initial and 
final dye concentrations (mg /l), respectively , V is the volume of solution (l ) and W is the 
adsorbent weight (g).  
 
3.5 Analytical determination of CR  
CR in the aqueous solution was analyzed using UV  spectrophotometer  (. A standard solution of 
the CR was scanned to determine the wavelength  (λmax) corresponding to maximum absorbance. 
The wav elength  corresponding to maximum absorbance was 498 nm.

3.6 Taguchi method  
Taguchi define d the qualit y of a product, in terms of the loss imparted by the produ ct to the 
society from the time the product is shipped to the customer. Some of these losses are due to 
deviation of the product’ s functional characteristic from its desired target value, and these are 
called losses due to functional variat ion. The uncontr ollable factors which cause the function al 
characteristics of a product to deviate from their target v alues are called noise factors, which can y = 37.392x

 be classified as external factors (e.g. temper atures and human errors), manufac turing 
imperfections (e.g. unit to unit variation in product parameters) and product deterioration.  
The overall aim of  quality engineering is to make products that are robust wit h respect to all 
noise factors. The most important stage  in the design of an experiment lies in the selection o f 
control factors. As many factors as possible should be included, so that it would be possible to 
identify non -significant variabl es at the earliest opportunity. Taguchi creates a standard 
orthogonal array to accommodate this requirement.  Taguchi used the  signal -to-noise (S/N) ratio 
as the quality  characteristic of choice. S/ N ratio is used as a measurable value instead of standard 
deviation due to the fact that as the mean decreases, the st andard deviation also decreases and 
vice versa. In less technical terms, signal -to-noise ratio compares the level of a desired signal 
(such as music) to the level of background noise. The higher the ratio, the less obtrusive the 
background noise is. "Signal -to-noise ratio" is sometimes used informally to refer to the rat io of 
useful information to false or irrelevant data in a conversation or exchange . In other words , the 
standard deviation cannot be minimized first and the mean brought to the target  (ghani et al,  
2004 .). Taguchi has empirically found that the two stage optimization procedure involv ing S/N 
ratios indeed gives the parameter level combinatio n, where the standard deviation is minimum 
while keeping the mean on target. This  implies that engineering systems behave in such a way 
that the manip ulated production factors can be divided into three  categories:  
1. Control factors, which affect process variability as measured by the S/N ratio.  
2. Signal factors, which do not influence the S/N ratio or  process mean.  
3. Factors, which do not affect the S/N ratio or process  mean.  
In practice, the target m ean value may change during the process development.  Two of the 
applications in which the concept of S/N ratio  is useful are the improvement  of quality through 
variability reduction and the improvement of  measurement. The S/N ratio characteristics can b e 
divided into three categories when th e characteristic is continuous:  
. 
Nominal is the best characteristic:                                                                 (3.2)  
 
Smaller th e better characteristics:                                                             (3.3)  
  
11 
 Larger the better characteristics:                                                           (3.4)  
 
where .y is the average of observed data,  
s2 the variance of y,  
n the number of observations,  
and y the observed data.  
For each type of the char acteristics, with the above S/N ratio transformation, the hig her the S/N 
ratio the better is the result.  
 
3.6.1 Design  of experiments with Taguchi orthogonal array (L 9 array)  
In this study, the experiment design is based on Taguchi method to determine the influence of 
control factors and an optimal condition to maximize the uptake of dye. In this experiment three 
control factors were taken into account i.e. Time, Temp, pH and were repeated on 3 levels. So L9 
orthogonal array was used to form  different combinations of factors which should be conducted 
in order to study the main effects and interactions (Jafari et al,  2008 .). The following table shows 
the various parameters selected and their respective levels in the present study:  
Factor  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  
pH 2 7 12 
Temperature(  C) 40 50 60 
Time(mins)  5 100 300 
Table 3.6.1: Various parameters selected and their respective levels  
 
3.6.2 Analysis of variation ( ANOVA ) 
ANOVA was performed in order to see whether the process parameters are statistically  
significant or not. The results of ANOVA are listed in table. The row which is marked as error 
refers to the error caused by uncontrollable factor (noise). In general the values should be below 
50 % .otherwise the results would not be reliable (Gonder et al., 2010 ). F ratio is a tool to 
indicate which parameter has a significant effect on the uptake of dye due to the control factors . 
The larger the F ratio the greater is the uptake.  The use of F -ratio in an ANOVA  is only helpful 
for the qualitative evaluation of factorial effects .Qualitative evaluation can be achieved with 
using percent contribution ( p %).

3.6.3 Data analysis  
The objective of experiment is to optimize the adsorption  parameters to get better  dye removal , 
the larger  the better characteristics was used. Table 2 and 5  shows the actual data for pH, time 
and temp along with their computed S/N ratio. Whereas Tables 3 and 6  shows the mean S/N ratio 
for each levels of pH, time and temp respectively  and arranged according to its rank obtained 
from its S/N ratio . These data were then plotted as shown in graphs 2 and 3  respectively.

 4.4 Adsorption studies  
 
4.4.1 Effect of agitation time and initial dye concentration  
Fig. 4.1.1 and 4.2.1  represents the effec ts of agitation time and initial congo red concentration on 
the adsorption of congo red by coconut shell and bael extract which is shown in comparison 
against the S/N ratio. It was found  that the adsorption increases with an increase in the agitation 
time and atta ins equilibrium after some time,  up to an initial agitation period of 100 mins more 
than 85% adsorption has been observed. From the above observation, it is evident that for lower 
initial concentration of the dye, the adsorption is very fast and hi gher removal of Congo red dye 
is seen if we increase the contact time. However, increase in initial dye concentration results in 
the fast attainment of saturation of activated carbon and higher residual dye in the equilibrium 
solution.  
 
4.4.2 Effect of pH  
The effects of initial pH on dye solution of three dyes removal were investigated by varying the 
pH from 2 to 12. Results as obtained from the S/N ratio graph suggest that coconut shell and 
Bael extract show almost same type of adsorption behaviors when pH  is taken as a factor. In both 
the cases it was seen that as we increase pH from 2 to 7 there is a significant reduction in S/N 
ratio suggesting that adsorption gets reduced during this phase of time. Now as the pH was 
increased from 7 to 12 it was seen th at adsorption again increased but it corresponding S/N ratio 
is bit lower than what was obtained at pH 2. This maybe due to the fact chemisorption takes 
place.  Chemisorption  is a classification of adsorption characterized by a strong interaction 
between an  adsorbate and a substrate surface, as opposed to physisorption which is characterized 
by a weak Van der Waals force . But overall it was observed that acidic solutions had better 
adsorption results than basic solutions.  
 
4.4.3 Effect of Temperature  
To obse rve the effect of temperature on the adsorption capacity,  experiments are carried out for 
1000 mg/L congo red at three  different temperatures ( 40, 50 and 60 ◦C) using 0.2 g of coconut 
shell and bael extract  per 50mL  of the solution. It has been observed t hat with increase in  
temperature, adsorption capacity increases as shown in Fig. 2 and 3  with highest adsorption 
being observed in the range of 40 – 50 ◦C. But as obtained from Taguchi’s method the temp  
18 
 factor is ranked as 3rd among all other factors which suggest that the reaction maybe exothermic 
in nature as suggested in an experiment conducted by Mohan et al (2002)and . It’s a known fact 
that increasing temperature increases mobility of ions so helps in faster adsorption but  as the 
reaction was exothermic so we observed degradation in its adsorption ability.  
 
4.4.4 Effect of adsorbent dosage  
In this experiment adsorbent dose was taken as a constant parameter i.e. adsorbent dose was 
fixed(0.2 g/50ml), but it is a known fact th at more adsorbent would of course help in faster and 
better adsorption of the dye from its solution ( Bilal  et al., 2004 ).

 5. CONCLUSION  
 
After completion of the experiment of removing congo  red dye from its solution following 
conclusions were drawn:  
1. The amount of dye removed increased with increasing time of contact and temp and 
decreased with increase in pH for both coconut (Cocos nucifera ) shell and bael (Aegle 
marmelos ) extract.  
2. After applying Taguchi it was found that in case of coconut shell pH played the most 
important role in catalyzing the adsorption process while for bael the most important 
factor was time.  
3. The optimum condition for adsorption onto coconut shell was found out to b e pH=2, 
temperature= 600C, time= 300 mins; while for bael extract it was found to be pH=2, 
temperature=500C, time = 300 mins  
 
So from this I can deduce from my experiment that
