 Abstract  19 
Development of sustanaible technologies  for treatment of recalcitrant  pollutants containing 20 
wastewaters has long been of great  interest. In this study,  we proposed an innovative concept 21 
of using microbial reverse -electrodialysis electrolysis cell (MREC)  based Fenton  process to 22 
treat azo dye wastewater . In such MREC -Fenton  integrated proces s, the production of H 2O2 23 
which is the key reactant of fenton -reaction was driven by  the electrons harvested  from the 24 
exoelectrogens and salinity -gradient between sea water and fresh water in MREC. Complete 25 
decolorization and mineralization of 400 mg  L-1 Orange G was achieved with apparent first 26 
order rate constants of 1.15 ±  0.06 and 0.26  ± 0.03 h-1, respectively. Furthermore, the  initial 27 
concentration of orange G, initial solution pH , catholyte concentration, high and low 28 
concentration salt water flow r ate and air flow rate were all  found to significantly affect the 29 
dye degradation. This study provides  an efficient and cost -effective system for the 30 
degradation of non -biodegradable pollutants . 31

 1. Introduction  42 
Azo dyes are the most important synthetic dyes in textile industries . During textile 43 
coloration processing, approximately 10-15% of azo dyes are lost in the discharged effluents 44 
(Pearce, 2003 ; Solanki et al., 2013 ). Textile wastewaters  if not efficiently treated would 45 
consititue a serious envi ronmental issue for water pollution (Wang & Bai, 2016 ). Most of azo 46 
dyes have  complex structures and are toxic, which makes them difficult to be degraded by 47 
biological processes (Banerjee et al., 2015 ). Electro -Fenton reaction as one of typical 48 
advanced oxidation processes  has been extensively studied as a promising and efficient 49 
method for treatment of dyes wastewater (Nidheesh & Gandhimathi, 2012 ). The most  50 
important advantages of Electro -Fenton technology  are high efficiency  and mild operating  51 
conditions  (Martinez -Huitle et al., 2015 ). However, there are still several  shortcomings  such 52 
as short lifetime of catalyst, costy  electrode materials and high energy consumption (ranges 53 
from 87.7 to 275  kWh kg TOC-1), which hinder the industrial application  (Gao et al., 2015 ; 54 
Martinez -Huitle et al., 2015 ; Nidheesh & Gandhimathi, 2012 ; Rosales et al., 2012 ). 55 
More recent ly, bioelectrochemical systems (BES) such as microbial fuel cell (MFC) and 56 
microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) based Electro -Fenton system s have been demonstrated as 57 
promising alternative method to the traditional Electro -Fenton process for the degradation o f 58 
azo dyes  (Feng et al., 2010 ; Solanki et al., 2013 ; Zhang et al., 2015b ). In such systems, the 59 
electrons used for H 2O2 production at the cathode are fully or partly derived from organic 60 
wastes by bacteria in the anode. Thus, the catalyst cost and energy -consumption have been 61 
greatly reduced. The BES -Fenton process  not only can remove the biodegradable organics in 62 
anode chamber, but also can remove the biorefractory  pollutants in cathode chamber (Solanki 63 
et al., 2013 ; Xu et al., 2011 ; Zhuang et al., 2010 ). However , there are still several challenges 64 4 
 which need to be addressed before field application. For example,  high mineralization 65 
efficiency has been mainly achieved at low dye concentration ( ≤100 mg L-1) in the MFC - 66 
Fenton process due to the extreme low H 2O2 production  (Asghar et al., 2014 ; Fu et al., 2010 ). 67 
Comparatively, MEC -Fenton system could be more efficient  due to much higher and faster 68 
H2O2 production  (Zhang et al., 2015b ). However, the r equirement of external power supply 69 
for MEC may add the capital and operational costs and also complicate the whole system. 70 
Thus, there is a great research and practical interest to develop more economical and efficient 71 
BES-Fenton system for dye wastewater  treatment.  72 
Recently, a novel type of BES system called microbial reverse -electrodialysis electrolysis 73 
cell (MREC), which combines a reverse electrodialysis stack (RED) and MEC have been 74 
developed to drive H 2 or CH 4 generation (Kim & Logan, 2011a ; Luo et al., 2014 ). In our 75 
previous study, the MREC system has been demonstrated as one promising system to produce 76 
high concentration of H 2O2 with low electrical energy consumption. Therefore, intergration of 77 
MREC and Fenton process could be an ideal technology to remove azo dye, which has never 78 
been previously reported.  79 
  In the pres ent study, we developed one novel MREC -Fenton system for the treatment of 80 
wastewater containing  Orange G  which is  a typical model azo dye used in dyeing the textile 81 
fabrics  (Banerjee et al., 2015 ; Cai et al., 2016 ). The effects of main  process paremeters such 82 
as the wastewater pH, initial Orange G concentration, HC and LC flow rate , and air flow rate 83 
were investigated. Furthermore , its concentration on the system performance was also 84 
investigated. It is the first time that MREC -Fenton system was used to degrade azo dye  85 
wastewater . This new system may  offer a potential platform technology for azo dye 86 
wastewater treatment.  87 5 
 2. Materials and Methods  88 
2.1. Configuration and operation of MREC -Electro -Fenton system.  89 
The MREC consists of anode and cathode chamber which were separated by a RED stack 90 
(Fig.1).  The anode and cathode chamber ha d a working volume of 50 mL (5 cm × 5 cm × 2 91 
cm) separately. The anode was a carbon fibre brush (5.0 cm diameter, 5.0 cm length, Mill - 92 
Rose, USA), which was heated to 450 oC for 30 min in a muffle furnace before use  (Zhang & 93 
Angelidaki, 2015b ). The anode was first enriched with biofilm in a MFC using domestic 94 
wastewater collected from primary clarifier (Lyngby Wastewater Treatment Plant, 95 
Copenhagen, Denmark) together with acetate sodium (20 mM) as substrate (Zhang & 96 
Angelidaki, 2015a ), and then transferred into the anode chamber of MREC.  The cathode was 97 
a graphite p late (3  cm ×  3 cm). In order to avoid anode substrate limitation on the system 98 
performance, the anode chamber was continuously fed with domestic wastewater amended 99 
with acetate sodium (~1.6 g COD L-1) at 10 0 mL d-1. The cathode chamber was filled with 40 100 
mL Orange G -containing synthetic wastewater  and operated in batch mode. Air was bubbled 101 
into the catholyte continuously  at the rate of 8 mL min-1 expect otherwise mentioned . HC and 102 
LC solution s was 35g L-1 and 0. 35g L-1 NaCl , respectively.  All experiments were carried out 103 
in duplicate at room temperature (22 ±2℃).  104 
2.2. A nalytical methods.  105 
  The concentration of Orange G was determined by a UV -vis spectrophotometry ( Spectronic 106 
20D+, Thermo Scientific ) at 478 nm  (Banerjee et al., 2015 ). The mineralization rate of orange 107 
G in the wastewater during  the degradation experiment was estimated through the analysis of  108 
total organic carbon (TOC) of the samples measured by shimadzu TOC 5000 A . The pH was 109 6 
 measured using a pH meter (PHM 210 pH meter, Radiometer). Chemical oxygen demand 110 
(COD) was measured according to the Standard Method (A.W.W.A, 1998 ). The voltage 111 
across on the external resistor  (10 Ω) was monitored with 30 min intervals using a digital 112 
multimeter (model 2700, Keithley Instruments, Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA). C urrent density 113 
was calculated base on the surface area (3 cm × 3 cm ) of cathode. Coulomic efficiency (CE) 114 
were calculated as previous reported (Kim & Logan, 2011a ). 115 
The apparent decolorization ra te constant ( Kapp) and mineralization rate constant ( KTOC) 116 
were determined according to Eq. 1 and Eq. 2  117 
     
                                                    (1) 118 
       
                                                   (2) 119 
where C 0 (mg L-1)  and C t (mg L-1)  are the Orange G concentrations at time 0 and reaction 120 
time t, respectively. TOC 0 (mg L-1) and TOC t (mg L-1) are the TOC concentrations at time 0 121 
and reaction time t, respectively.  122 
  The TOC removal and corresponding electrical energy consumption were evalutated to 123 
determine whether the MREC -Fenton process is economical. Electrical energy consumption 124 
in the MREC system was mainly due to the pumping system for supply of anolyte , high 125 
concentration ( HC) and low concentration ( LC) solution and the aeration of catholyte . The 126 
specific electrical energy consumption was calculated in terms of the removal of 1 kg of TOC 127 
from dye wastewater by the MREC -Fenton process (kWh kg-1) using Eq. 3.  128 
                            
                            (3) 129 7 
 where W ( kWh ) is the total electrical energy consumption, which was measured by a spar 130 
meter (Type NZR230, S.L. Energitekinik, Denmark). V 0 (L) and V t (L) are the volume of dye 131 
wastewater at time 0 and reaction time t, respectively.  132 
3.  Results and discussion  133 
3.1. System performance  134 
Fig. 2 shows the decolorization and minerlization of orange G in the cathode of MREC - 135 
Fenton system with the initial Orange G concentration of 100 mg L-1. The decolorization  136 
efficiency of Orange G reached to about 70% within one  hour, and 88% of Orange G was 137 
removed after 3 hours (Fig. 2A). Comparatively, the decoloriezation  efficiency  of 10% was 138 
observed  after 5 hours under open circuit condition  (control 1), which could be due to the 139 
absorption on the electrode material and the anion membrane (the side closed to the cathode 140 
chamber). The Orange G decolorization efficiency without air flow in cathode chamber 141 
(control 2) and without Fe2+ addition in catholyte (control 3) only reached about 32% and 142 
45%, respectively, after 5 hours. The minerlization  of Orange G in terms of  TOC removal 143 
showed similar trend as decoloration. As shown in Fig.  2B, the TOC removal efficiency could 144 
reach to 87% after 5h, which was only 16% and 13% in c ontrol 2 and 3 , respectively . The 145 
slight decolorization observed in control experiments could be due to the reduction of Orange 146 
G as electron acceptor at the cathode. This is supported by the observation that Orange G 147 
could be decomposed to colorless short er organic molecules without dissolved O 2 in control 2 148 
and lack of the Fenton regent (Fe2+) in control 3 . Similar behaviou r from other azo dyes (e.g., 149 
Orange 7 and Methylene Blue) have been previously observed in BES system  (Li et al., 2016 ; 150 
Mu et al., 2009 ; Zhang et al., 2015a ). On the other hand, the results also confirmed that the  151 
removal of Organge G was mainly due to the Fenton reaction driven by the energy from 152 8 
 anodic bacteria and salinity gradient (Luo et al., 2011 ). In addition , based on the experiment 153 
data the degradation kinetics of Orange G dye were studied, which showed that degradation 154 
of Orange G d ye followd a first-order reaction  (Fig. 2 ). The decolorization rate constant (K app) 155 
and mineralization rate constant (K TOC) were 1.22 h-1 and 0.46 h-1, respectively. In recent 156 
studies  for oxidization of Methylene blue ( a compound similar to Orange G dye ) in MFC - 157 
MEC -Fenton system, K app of 0.43 h-1 and K TOC of 0.22 h-1 were reported, which were much 158 
lower than that observed in this study (Zhang et al., 2015b ). Feng et al. (2010) also reported a 159 
first order removal reaction of Orange II with K app of 0.212 h-1 and K TOC of 0.0827 h-1 in 160 
MFC -Fenton system.  These results demonstrated that the MREC -Fenton system could be 161 
more efficient than other BES system for azo dy e wastewater treatment.  162 
3.2. The effect of initial wastewater pH on the s ystem performance  163 
Degradation performance of organic compounds by Electro -Fenton technologies are often 164 
found to be dependent on the wastewater pH, and for different dyes in different degradation 165 
systems, the effect of wastewater pH was found to vary greatly. On the other h and, the actual 166 
dye wastwaters may have variable pH values. Therefore, the effect of initial  pH on the Orange 167 
G wastewater degradation in the MREC -Fenton system was examined . As shown in Fig.S1 168 
(Supplementary  data) , the decolorization and TOC removal  were  greatly affected by the initial 169 
pH of the wastewater.  The increasing of initial pH from 2 to 7  caused a decrease in 170 
decolorization  rate and TOC removal  rate. The hig hest removal rate of Orange G was found at 171 
pH 2 (79 ± 0.8 mg L-1 h-1) in the first hour, and the maximum decolorization efficiency 172 
reached to 100% after 4 h reaction.  The decolorization and TOC removal rate  decreased with 173 
further increasing of the initial pH from 3 to 7. For example, when the pH increased to above 174 
4, the d ecolorization rate of Orange G started to decline . When the pH increased to above 7 175 9 
 (Fig. S1) during the reaction, the decolorization process continued with a rate of 4.9 ± 0.4 mg 176 
L-1 h-1, which w as much lower than 32 mg L-1 h-1 (average in 3 hours) at pH 2. However, the 177 
TOC was not decreasing with the reaction time when the initial pH was above 4. Moreover, 178 
the pH also increasing along the reaction time  in all tests (Fig.S1 ). In general, the 179 
decolourization efficiency  was higher than the TOC removal at all  the tested initial pH. That 180 
is because the azo bond could be first cleaved  by hydroxyl radical, resulting in the formation 181 
of colorless shorter organic molecules. T he results observed was in line with the conventional 182 
Fenton process for Orange G degradation (Cai et al., 2016 ). Even though the acidic 183 
environment is benefit ting the cleavage of the azo bond  and mineralization of azo dye, initial 184 
pH lower than 2 may counteract generation of hydroxyl radical . Thus, pH 2 was adopted for 185 
the following test, unless otherwise stated.  186 
3.3. Effect of initial Orange G concentration   187 
The performance of azo dyes removal by the BES -Fenton process is often found to be 188 
independent on the dye concentration (Asghar et al., 2014 ). In this section, the initial 189 
concentration of Orange G was varied from  100 to 500 mg L-1 to explore its impact on the 190 
system performance. The time course of Orange G dye degradation is shown in Fig. 3 . For 191 
initial Orange G concentration s of 100, 200, 300, and 400 mg L-1, the degradation efficiency  192 
after 6 h was about 100%, w hile degradation efficiency of 94.4% was obtained at 500 mg-1 193 
(Fig.3 A). However, the K app and K TOC decreased with the increasing of Orange G 194 
concentration (Fig.3 B). For example, the K app of 1.15 ± 0.04 h-1 and K TOC of 0.46 ± 0.05 h-1 195 
were observed at initial concentration of 100 mg L-1, while only 0.59 ± 0.03 h-1  and 0.21 ± 196 
0.01 h-1 were obtained at 500 mg L-1. The behaviour was consistent with that observed in 197 
MEC -Fenton and classical Fenton process (Zhang et al ., 2015b ). 198 10 
 The current density of MREC increased with increasing of Orange G concentration 199 
(Fig.3 C). Similar  to electro -Fenton  and photoelectro -Fenton processes , relatively higher 200 
current density was benefical for the degradation of Orange G (Pereira et al., 2016 ). 201 
Interesting ly, the current density decreased along with decolorization of Grange G wastewater. 202 
For example, the current density decreased from 1.73 ± 0.04 to 1.26 ± 0.02 A m-2 with the 203 
reaction time at the initial Grange G  concentration of 400 mg L-1. This observation was 204 
different with previous report in which the current density was stable at same initial 205 
methylene blue concentration in MEC -Fenton system (Zhang et al., 2015b ). The higher 206 
concentration Orange G l ead to higher current  density, which could support the conclusion 207 
that the Orange G might also function as electron acceptor at the cathode. Moreover, we can 208 
hereby deduce that Orange G might be a stronger electron acceptor than oxygen  in the 209 
cathode chamb er, which still needs to be clarified in future work.  210 
3.4. Effect of cathode electrolyte on degradation of Orange G .  211 
  It was previously shown that the supporting electrolyte can affect the Electro -Fenton process 212 
(Bakheet et al., 2013 ; Pajootan et al., 2014 ). In addition, the current density achieved in the 213 
MREC can also be increased by enhancing the concentration of the cathode supporting 214 
electrolyte (Nam et al., 2012 ). It is therefore of  great interest to evaluate the effects of the 215 
cathode supporting electrolyte (Na 2SO 4) on Orange G  removal. In this investgation, the initial 216 
concentration of Orange G was kept at 400 mg L-1, while the concentration of NaSO 4 varied 217 
from 0, 25, 50, 75, to 100 mM. Parameters describing the treatment performance such as 218 
decolorization , minerlization  and current  density were shown in the Fig.4 . No significant 219 
difference on the final decolorization and minerlization efficienc y was  observed (Fig.4A and 220 
4B) which was consistent with that observed in other Electro -Fenton systems (Bakheet et al., 221 11 
 2013 ). However, the K app and K TOC (the slopes of the inserted figure) increased with the 222 
increasing of NaSO 4 concentration and reached maximum value at 50 mM NaSO 4 (0.86 and 223 
0.24 h-1). However , there was no further increas when the catholyte  concentration was higher 224 
than 50 mM. In compari son, the current density  increased slightly with the  increasing  of the 225 
concentration of NaSO 4 within the tested range ( Fig.4 C). This is probably because higher 226 
concentration of  the catholyte could enhance the conductivity and thereby  lowering the 227 
overall resistanc e (D’Angelo et al., 2015 ). 228 
3.5. Effect of HC and LC flow rate on the system performance.  229 
High flow rates  of HC and LC solutions can improve the cell potential of MREC  (Kim & 230 
Logan, 2011b ). However , increasing flow rates could also increase energy  consumption on 231 
pump ing the HC and LC solutions  through  the RED  stack.  The energy  required for pumping 232 
is an important cost  for the MREC operation. Thus there is a trade off between pumping and 233 
treatment performance. The optimal flow rates of HC and LC solutions were different for 234 
various MREC  systems  (D’Angelo et al., 2015 ; Kim & Logan, 2011a ; Watson et al., 2015 ). In 235 
this study, an increase in the flow rate of the HC and LC from 0.2 to 0.5 mL min-1 improved 236 
the decoloration and the mineralization rate  (Fig. 5 ). Notably, there was no remarkable 237 
difference on degradation rate  when the HC and LC flow rate was between 1.0 and 1.5 mL 238 
min-1. The current density increased with the increasi ng of HC and LC flow rate (Fig.  5C), 239 
which implied that the increase of HC and LC f low rate  were able to accelerate the cathode 240 
reaction. The behavior was consistent with that observed in the MRC for electrical power 241 
production (Kim & Logan, 2011b ). Therefore, pumping  intensity  could be used as a control 242 
for the degradation of azo dye in the MREC. On the other hand, the decoloration and the 243 
mineralization rate might not always be improved by increasing solution flow rates. It could 244 12 
 be due to that the  HC and LC flow rate was no longer the predominate limiting facto r when it 245 
over a certain level (e.g., 1.0 mL min-1 in this study), since  the electrical energy output  in 246 
RED depends on the predominate resistance  at a given HC and LC flow rate (Zhu et al., 2015 ). 247 
Considering both the Orange G degradation an d energy consumption, the optimal flow rate 248 
was considered to be 0.5 mL min-1. 249 
3.6. Effect of air flow rate on the system performance.  250 
  The effect of air flow rate on decolorization  rate are shown in Fig. 6. As presented in Fig.  6, 251 
it was clearly shown that the Orange G degradation rate was greatly affected by the air flow 252 
rate. The K app and K TOC increased with the air flow rate and reached the maximum value at 16 253 
mL min-1. When the air flow rate was further increased to 32 mL min-1, no further increase in 254 
Kapp was observed, while K TOC decreased slightly. The observation indicates that both 255 
inadequate and excessive air supply could deteriorate  the mineralization. Moreover, the 256 
enhanced air flow rate could inc rease the current densit y (Fig.  6B), which was consistent with 257 
what has been observed in Electro -Fenton processes (Tian et al., 2016 ). The air flow rate 258 
could also affect the total electrical energy consumption.  Thus, setting an optimum air flow 259 
rate may not only improve the H 2O2 production but also reduce the operating cost of the 260 
system (Tian et al., 2016 ; Zhou et al., 2013 ). 261 
3.7. Columbic efficiency and energy consumption  262 
The coulombic efficiency  (CE)  was 15.56  ± 0.76% at the air flow rate 16 mL min-1 and  HC 263 
and LC solution  flow rate of 0.5 mL min-1, while the COD removal reached 81.16  ± 1.85% in 264 
the anode fed with domestic wastewater. The low CE could be due to the oxidation of organic 265 
matter by the non -exoelectrogenic microorganisms from wastewater.  The anolyte pH was 266 13 
 main tained at 6.7 -7.9, which exclude inhibition of anodic biofilm by non optimal pH (Kim & 267 
Logan, 2011b ). 268 
  Energy  consumption is one of the major concerns for wastewater  treatment  using Electro - 269 
Fenton  technology , especially for recalcitrant pollutant  degradation  (Liu et al., 2015 ). In this 270 
MREC -Fenton process, the current density for Orange G decolorization was in the range of 271 
1.27-1.37 A m-2 (Fig.  6B), which is much lower than that required by Electro -Fenton process 272 
(500 A m-2) (Pereira et al., 2016 ). The MREC -Fenton process was driven by renewable 273 
energy derived from domestic wastewater  and salinity gradient, which are abundant and 274 
relatively unlimited (Kim & Logan, 2011a ; Zhu et al., 2014 ). The costs of  the MREC -Fenton 275 
system mainly includ capital and operating costs. The MREC capital costs are approx. 930 € 276 
m-3 (in Denmark ) (Zhang & Angelidaki, 2016 ). The operating costs  mainly include reagent 277 
costs and e nergy consumption for pumping . The MREC -Fenton system required energy 278 
consumption of 25.93  kWh  (kg TOC )-1, which is much lower than for traditional Electro - 279 
Fenton peocess treat Orange 7 with a cost of 865  kWh  (kg TOC )-1 (Xu et al., 2008 ). It was 280 
also much lower than that required by sequential Electro -Fenton  process (45.8 kWh  (kg 281 
TOC )-1) (Gao et al., 2015 ). However, our estimates were base d on small laboratory -scale 282 
reactor and more accurate assessment is required. The above results suggest that the MREC - 283 
Fenton system could be  a potentially  cost-effective method for  azo dye  degradation . 284 
3.8. Practical significance and perspectives  285 
The results in this study demonstrated that the MREC -Fenton system was environment - 286 
friendly, efficient an d low -cost compared to conventional Electro -Fenton system. In this 287 
process, the MREC not only can treat domestic wastewater in anode chamber, but also 288 
degrade Orange G in cathod e chamber.  Compared to other bioelectro -Fenton system such as 289 14 
 MFC and MEC, the MREC  has its own merits . Firstly, the degradation rate was greatly 290 
improved by employing the RED stacks between the anode and cathode, compared to MFC. 291 
Secondly, unlike MEC base d Fonton process, the electric energy was mainly produced by 292 
RED stack using the renewable salinity -gradient energy which  replaced the electrical grid 293 
power source. Furthermore, salinity -gradient,  as source of energy, is abundant, which could 294 
be regenerate d using waste heat and thermolytic solutions or seawater and river water (Kim & 295 
Logan, 2011a ; Nam et al., 2012 ; Zhu et al., 2014 ). Thirdly, the energy consumption was only 296 
25.93  kWh  (kg TOC )-1 under optimal operation condition, indicat ing that the MREC is a low - 297 
cost biolectro -Fenton system with efficient mineralization. Though promising, more efforts 298 
should be made to accelerate the industrial application. First of all, this system has the 299 
potential to degrade many refractory compounds, so other nonbiodegradable and toxic 300 
pollutants such as nitrobenzene and phenol should be tested for their potential degradation by 301 
this system. Although the decalorisation rate was high, the TOC removal rate was low. For 302 
improving the TOC removal rate , development of a more cost -effective and efficient MREC 303 
reactor configuration  is required . Moreover , the CE was relatively low which could probably 304 
be improved by process optimisation . Lastly, large scale system with continu ous-flow 305 
operation should be tested in order to validate the technology  at industrial scale conditions . 306 
4. Conclusions  307 
This study demonstrated  that the MREC -Fenton system is an effective and environmentally 308 
friendly technology for azo dye wastewater treatment. In such system, Orange G (400 mg L-1) 309 
was not only effectively degraded with first order kinetic constant of 1.15 ± 0.06 h-1, but also 310 
highly mineralized with TOC removal efficiency of 99.6% and K TOC of 0.26 ± 0.02 h-1 at pH 311 
2. Notably the energy consumption was only 25.93  kWh  (kg TOC )-1. This work provides a 312 15 
 cost-effective method for azo dye degradation, which is also attractive and applicable for 313 
efficient degradation of recalcitrant pollutants.  314
