Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors perturb the cell cycle and have great potential as anti-cancer agents,
but their mechanism of action is not well established. HDACs classically function as repressors of geneexpression, tethered to sequence-specific transcription factors. Here we report that HDAC3 is a critical,transcription-independent regulator of mitosis. HDAC3 forms a complex with A-Kinase-Anchoring ProteinsAKAP95 and HA95, which are targeted to mitotic chromosomes. Deacetylation of H3 in mitosis requiresAKAP95/HA95 and HDAC3 and provides a hypoacetylated H3 tail that is the preferred substrate for Aurora Bkinase. Phosphorylation of H3S10 by Aurora B leads to dissociation of HP1 proteins from methylated H3K9residues on mitotic heterochromatin. This transcription-independent pathway, involving interdependentchanges in histone modification and protein association, is required for normal progression through mitosisand is an unexpected target of HDAC inhibitors, a class of drugs currently in clinical trials for treating cancer.

Covalent modifications of the core histones at their N-
terminal tails are involved in many nuclear processesincluding DNA packaging, DNA replication, and tran-scriptional regulation, as well as chromosome condensa-tion and segregation during mitosis. Specific patterns ofhistone modifications regulate protein–protein interac-tions and protein access to DNA (Turner 2000; Jenuweinand Allis 2001). In particular, phosphorylation of histone3 (H3) on Ser 10 (S10) is a well-established, evolution-arily conserved mitotic event, observed in ciliate, yeast,worm, and vertebrates (Gurley et al. 1973; Paulson andTaylor 1982; Hendzel et al. 1997; Cobb et al. 1999; Hsuet al. 2000). Mutation of H3S10 in Tetrahymena leads to
both chromosome condensation and segregation defects(Wei et al. 1999).
The serine/threonine kinase Aurora B phosphorylates
H3S10, a mechanism that is also evolutionarily con-served (Richie and Golden 2005). Depletion of Aurora BinDrosophila cells and Caenorhabditis elegans resultsin reduced H3S10 phosphorylation and is associatedwith impaired chromosome condensation and segrega-tion (Adams et al. 2001; Giet and Glover 2001). In mam-malian cells, phosphorylation of H3S10 by Aurora Bdissociates HP1 from heterochromatin during mitosis(Fischle et al. 2005; Hirota et al. 2005). While bothAurora A and B can phosphorylate H3S10 in cell-freeexperiments, in intact cells only Aurora B colocalizeswith the phosphorylated H3S10 during the early stage ofmitosis (Crosio et al. 2002). Consistent with its centralrole in mitosis, impairment of Aurora B activity resultsin defects in chromosome condensation, segregation,and cellular division (Hsu et al. 2000; Giet and Glover2001; Goto et al. 2002; Meraldi et al. 2004). Recently,Aurora B has been implicated as mediator of a “meth-phos switch” whereby Aurora-dependent phosphoryla-tion of H3S10 leads to the dissociation of the methyl-lysine-binding protein heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)from chromatin during mitosis (Fischle et al. 2005; Hi-rota et al. 2005).
In contrast to the links between histone phosphoryla-
tion and mitosis, the role and regulation of histoneacetylation during mitotic progression have been less

acetyltransferases (HATs) is a paradigm for transcrip-tional activation and is reversed by histone deacetylases(HDACs) (Grunstein 1997; Wade et al. 1997; Cheung etal. 2000b). Notably, hypoacetylation of histones has alsobeen found during mitosis. The acetylation of histonesbegins to decrease during the early stages of mitosis, isabsent in metaphase and anaphase, then gradually in-creases in the late mitotic phase (Marian and Winters-berger 1982; Jeppesen et al. 1992; Kruhlak et al. 2001;Chen et al. 2005; Valls et al. 2005; Nishiyama et al.2006).
A role for histone deacetylation during mitosis has
been further suggested by the cell cycle effects of HDACinhibitors (Marks et al. 2001; Wong et al. 2005). HDACinhibitors have attracted considerable interest in theclinic, with early studies suggesting anti-tumor efficacyfor a range of malignancies including T-cell lymphoma(Marks et al. 2001; Zhang et al. 2005a). However, themolecular mechanisms of their anti-tumor effects arenot well established. Most investigators have focused ontranscriptional mechanisms, and in particular on the in-duction of the cell cycle inhibitor p21, but while HDACinhibitors globally increase histone acetylation, the levelof transcription is altered in only 2%–5% of all expressed
genes (Della Ragione et al. 2001; Johnstone and Licht2003). Moreover, transcriptional mechanisms do not ex-plain the dramatic mitotic effects of HDAC inhibition,which impairs mitotic progression with associated de-fects in chromosome condensation, segregation, and ki-netochore assembly (Qiu et al. 2000; Sandor et al. 2000;Shin et al. 2003; Warrener et al. 2003; Mikhailov et al.2004; Robbins et al. 2005).
HDAC3 is widely expressed, highly regulated, and me-
diates its function through protein–protein interactions(Emiliani et al. 1998; Guenther et al. 2002; Yang et al.2002). Immature HDAC3 is folded by the TCP-1 ringcomplex (TRiC) before interacting with the transcrip-tional corepressor protein N-CoR (nuclear receptor core-pressor) and SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoid andthyroid hormone receptors) (Li et al. 2000; Guenther etal. 2002). N-CoR and SMRT serve as activating cofactorsfor HDAC3 enzymatic activity (Guenther et al. 2001;Zhang et al. 2002). HDAC3 activity is also regulatedthrough phosphorylation by casein kinase II and dephos-phorylation by protein phosphatase 4 (Zhang et al.2005b). HDAC3 is required for transcriptional repressionby nuclear hormone receptors (Ishizuka and Lazar 2003,2005) and also suppresses the transcriptional potential ofother transcription factors including YY1, GATA-2, andTFII-I (Ozawa et al. 2001; Yao et al. 2001; Wen et al.2003). HDAC3 knockdown was recently shown to in-crease cells in G2/M phase in human colon cancer cells(Wilson et al. 2006), but the molecular mechanism ofthis effect is unknown.
Here we report that HDAC3 forms a complex with
A-Kinase Anchor Protein 95 (AKAP95) and its relativeHomologous to AKAP95 (HA95) in mitotic cells.AKAP95 and HA95 have been previously shown to berecruited to mitotic chromosomes and involved in mi-totic progression, but their mechanism of action is ob-scure (Collas et al. 1999; Orstavik et al. 2000; Steen et al.2000). We find that HDAC3, along with AKAP95/HA95,is required for normal mitotic progression, and that bothHDAC3 and AKAP95/HA95 are essential for global his-tone deacetylation that occurs during mitosis. Unexpect-edly, HDAC3 and AKAP95/HA95 are also required formaximal phosphorylation of H3S10 in mitosis. Reduc-tion in HDAC3 level and pharmacological inhibition ofHDAC activity leads to increased histone acetylation,decreased H3S10 phosphorylation, and accumulation ofcells in mitosis, suggesting that inhibition of HDAC3 issufficient to explain the cell cycle effects of HDAC in-hibitors. The reduced phosphorylation H3S10 can be ex-plained by the observation that the H3S10 kinase activ-ity of Aurora B is dependent on the histone acetylationstate, with hypoacetylated histone tails being the pre-ferred substrate. HP1 dissociation from mitotic chromo-somes is prevented by knockdown of AKAP95/HA95,selective loss of HDAC3, or pharmacological HDAC in-hibitors, demonstrating that the AKAP–HDAC3–AuroraB axis is upstream of the Aurora B-HP1 “meth-phos
switch.” This novel pathway explains the changes in
histone modifications that occur during mitosis, andsuggests that HDAC inhibitors used in cancer treat-ment target HDAC3 via this nontranscriptional mecha-nism.
Results
AKAP95 and HA95 are present in high-molecular-
weight HDAC3 complexes and interact directly withHDAC3
To explore the biological functions of HDAC3, we puri-
fied endogenous proteins that coimmunoprecipitatedwith Flag-HDAC3 stably expressed in 293T cells. Pro-teins identified through silver staining and mass spec-trometry included expected components of HDAC3complexes including N-CoR, SMRT, TBL1, and GPS2(Fig. 1A; Guenther et al. 2000; Li et al. 2000; Zhang et al.2002). An additional band, corresponding to a molecularmass of ∼95 kDa, was found to contain both AKAP95 and
HA95, and further verified by Western analysis (Fig. 1A).To further test the intracellular interaction of AKAP95with HDAC3, HA-epitope tagged-AKAP95 was ex-pressed in 293T cells, followed by immunoprecipitationwith anti-HA antibody. Overexpressed AKAP95 was as-sociated with endogenous HDAC3, as well as endog-enous N-CoR (Fig. 1B) and SMRT (data not shown). En-dogenous HDAC3 was also reliably detected in immu-noprecipitates of endogenous HA95, establishing thatthe in vivo association of AKAP95/HA95 with HDAC3was not a result of protein overexpression (Fig. 1C).Moreover, recombinant HDAC3 (Fig. 1D), but not othercomponents of HDAC3 complexes (data not shown), in-teracted with recombinant AKAP95 and HA95 in vitro,suggesting that AKAP95 and HA95 are recruited tothe complex through HDAC3 (Fig. 1D).

little effect on this interaction (Fig. 1D). Taken together,these data demonstrate a physical interaction betweenAKAP95/HA95 and HDAC3.
Interaction of HDAC3 with AKAP95 and HA95
increases during mitosis
AKAP 95 and HA95 have been previously found to be
associated with mitotic chromosomes (Collas et al.1999; Martins et al. 2000; Steen et al. 2000; Eide et al.2002), so we next investigated the AKAP–HDAC3 inter-action during mitosis. Immunoprecipitation of endog-enous HDAC3 with endogenous AKAP95 or HA95 wasmarkedly increased in nocodazole-synchronized cellsblocked in G2/M (Fig. 2A). Conversely, coimmunopre-cipitation of AKAP95 and HA95 with HDAC3 was alsoincreased in nocodazole-treated cells (Fig. 2B). In con-trast, the interaction of HDAC3 with SMRT or N-CoRwas essentially unaltered in nocodazole-synchronizedcells (Fig. 2B). To exclude the possibility that the in-creased HDAC3-AKAP95/HA95 interactions were dueto drug toxicity, 20 h of aphidicolin treatment was usedto synchronize 293T cells at the G1/S transition, thencells were released from aphidicolin treatment for 2 or 12h to obtain S-phase- and G2/M-enriched cell popula-tions, respectively. The AKAP–HDAC3 interactionswere not increased either in G1/S- or S-phase-synchro-nized cells (Fig. 2C). However, the interaction betweenendogenous AKAP95 and HDAC3 was robustly in-creased in G2/M cells, which have the highest level ofH3S10 phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). Using immunofluores-cence staining and confocal microscopy, AKAP95 andHDAC3 colocalization was also evident in early mitoticcells compared with cells at interphase (Fig. 2D). To bet-ter characterize the mitotic AKAP/HDAC3 complex,HDAC3 complexes prepared from nocodazole-synchro-nized Flag-HDAC3 stable cells were eluted from immu-noprecipitates using Flag peptide then size separated bygel filtration (Fig. 2E). HDAC3 cochromatographed withSMRT in two catalytically active high-molecular-weightcomplexes (∼1.5–2 mDa and ∼550 kDa) (Guenther et al.
2000; Li et al. 2000; Zhang et al. 2002), and was alsodetected in lower-molecular-weight complexes contain-ing the TCP1/H9252 subunit of the TRiC chaperone machin-
ery (Guenther et al. 2002). AKAP95 and HA95 were pres-ent in the higher-molecular-weight complexes that alsocontained SMRT (and N-CoR, TBL1, and GPS) (data notshown).
Depletion of AKAP95 and HA95 induces G2/M arrest
and mitotic defects
AKAP95 and HA95 have been proposed to have a role in
chromosome condensation during mitosis (Collas et al.1999; Martins et al. 2000; Steen et al. 2000; Eide et al.2002). We used short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) to knockdown AKAP95 and HA95 (Fig. 3A) in order to study theirfunction in the cell cycle. Knockdown of AKAP95 orHA95 individually had modest effects on the cell cycle(data not shown). However, simultaneous depletion ofboth AKAP95 and HA95 substantially increased the per-centage of G2/M cells as determined by flow-assistedcytometric analysis (FACS) (Fig. 3B). This was, in largepart, due to a significantly increased proportion of cellsin mitosis (Fig. 3C). Of note, many of these mitotic cellswere of quite aberrant morphology, which included in-complete chromosomal condensation or “lagging” chro-
mosomes (Fig. 3D, indicated by the arrowhead in themiddle panel, and in higher magnification inset), chro-mosome segregation defection like a chromosome bridge(Fig. 3D, the right panel), as well as tri- or multipolarmitoses (Fig. 6E [below], bottom right panel). In contrast,

were largely unperturbed (Fig. 3C,D).
Depletion of HDAC3 induces G2/M arrest and mitotic
defects similar to those caused by AKAP95/HA95knockdown
We next tested the effects of HDAC3 knockdown, again
via shRNA (Fig. 4A). Knockdown of HDAC3 also sub-stantially increased the percentage of G2/M cells (Fig.4B), and mitotic counts again revealed an increased pro-portion of mitotic cells (Supplementary Fig. 2A). A largeproportion of the cells exhibited aberrant mitoses in theabsence of HDAC3 (Supplementary Fig. 2B), similar tothat seen with knockdown of AKAP95/HA95 (cf. Fig.3D). Thus, knockdown of HDAC3 or AKAP95/HA95 ledto similar impairment of mitotic progression and in-creased aberrancy of mitotic figures.HDAC inhibition blocks the cell cycle at G2/M phasein a transcriptional-independent manner
Nonspecific inhibition of HDACs by pharmacological
inhibitors has been shown to induce cell cycle arrestbeyond prometaphase, in association with mitotic de-fects reminiscent of the effects of selective loss ofHDAC3 demonstrated above (Qiu et al. 2000; Sandor etal. 2000; Shin et al. 2003; Mikhailov et al. 2004; Robbinset al. 2005). Indeed, the nonselective HDAC inhibitortrichostatin A (TSA) caused G2/M arrest both in humanMCF7 breast carcinoma cells (Fig. 5A) as well as in hu-man 293T embryonic kidney cells (Fig. 5B), similar tothe effect of selective depletion of HDAC3. In contrast,shRNA depletion of the related HDAC1 did not causemitotic arrest (Supplementary Fig. 3a), suggesting thatHDAC3 is a major target by which HDAC inhibitorsinduce G2/M arrest. The G2/M arrest due to TSA wasreversible (Supplementary Fig. 4), and two additional

proic acid), also blocked the cell cycle in G2/M (Fig. 5C).Importantly, the G2/M arrest due to each of the threeHDAC inhibitors was maintained in the presence of ac-tinomycin D (Act D) (Fig. 5C), at a concentration thatblocked global transcription by >90% (SupplementaryFig. 5). Act D alone has been reported to induce a partialG1 arrest (Kim et al. 2005), and this was observed in ourstudies as well (Fig. 5C). These data implied that themajor effect of HDAC inhibition on the cell cycle—i.e.,G2/M arrest—was not due to effects of these drugs ontranscription. This, in turn, suggested that failure todeacetylate histones during mitosis directly impairs onmitosis progression.
Histone deacetylation during mitosis requires HDAC3
and AKAP95/HA95
Our finding of a role for HDAC3 and AKAP95/HA95 in
mitosis led us to consider a potential regulatory role forhistone deacetylation. Consistent with previous obser-vations (Marian and Wintersberger 1982; Jeppesen et al.1992; Kruhlak et al. 2001; Valls et al. 2005), we observedthat H3 and H4 are globally hypoacetylated during mi-tosis (Fig. 6A). This result was confirmed by quantitativemass spectrometric analysis of H3 isolated from nonsyn-chronized or nocodazole-synchronized HeLa cells (Fig.6B). Abundance levels of unmodified and trimethylatedK9 (Fig. 6B), as well as mono- and dimethylated K9 (datanot shown), remain consistent in nonsynchronized andmitotic HeLa cells. However, single acetylation of K9 orK14 and K9/K14 double acetylation dramatically de-creased (twofold and sevenfold, respectively) in mitoticcells (Fig. 6B). Similarly, we also noted the decreases insingle acetylation of H3K18 or K23 as well as K18/K23dual acetylation in nocodazole-synchronized HeLa cells(Supplementary Fig. 6). These results further confirmthat H3 is globally deacetylated on multiple lysines inmitotic cells.
We next used shRNA to reduce cellular HDAC3 levels
and determine whether deacetylation of histones duringmitosis is dependent on HDAC3. Indeed, HDAC3knockdown abolished the global histone deacetylationcharacteristic of mitotic, nocodazole-treated cells, buthad little effect on global histone acetylation in nonsyn-chronized cells (Fig. 6C). This result indicated thatHDAC3 is required for the deacetylation of mitotic his-tones. Knockdown of N-CoR or SMRT individually didnot significantly change the cell cycle progression or his-tone acetylation (data not shown), suggesting that theyredundantly activate HDAC3 in this context. We nextused shRNA to knock down AKAP95 and HA95 to ad-dress whether the HDAC3-dependent histone deacetyla-tion during mitosis requires these AKAPs. Individualknockdown of AKAP95 or HA95 modestly reduced thedeacetylation of H3 and H4 during mitosis (data notshown). More strikingly, simultaneous knockdown ofAKAP95 and HA95 completely prevented the mitoticdeacetylation of H3 and H4 (Fig. 6D). Note that phos-phorylation of H3S10, which occurs in mitosis, did notalter our ability to detect H3 acetylation level (Supple-mentary Fig. 7).

phosphorylation of H3 during mitosis
H3S10 phosphorylation is a mitotic marker, and there-
fore should increase in HDAC3- or AKAP95/HA95-de-pleted cells that contain numbers of mitotic cells. Para-doxically, however, phosphorylation of H3S10 was actu-ally reduced when HDAC3 or AKAP95/HA95 levelswere depleted (Fig. 6C,D). Immunofluorescence analysisof AKAP95/HA95 double-knockdown HeLa cells also re-vealed marked reduction in H3 S10 phosphorylationwithin mitotic nuclei (Fig. 6E). These data are consistentwith recent reports that TSA treatment decreased phos-phorylation of H3S10 in cancer cells (Dowling et al.2005; Robbins et al. 2005). Indeed, we confirmed thatTSA treatment reduced H3S10 phosphorylation inMCF7 breast cancer cells (Fig. 6F) despite increased thenumber of cells in G2/M (see Fig. 5A). A similar disso-ciation between H3S10 phosphorylation and the percent-age of G2/M-arrested cells after TSA treatment was ob-served in 293T cells (data not shown). These results sug-gest an unanticipated relationship between AKAP95/HA95–HDAC3-dependent histone deacetylation and themitosis-associated phosphorylation of H3S10.

tones; hypoacetylated histones remained in the superna-tant (Fig. 7A). H3S10 phosphorylation was detected inthe hypoacetylated H3 fraction (supernatant), but not inthe hyperacetylated H3 fraction (immunoprecipitate)(Fig. 7A).
We also tested this hypothesis by quantitative mass
spectrometry (Fig. 7B). We reasoned that if H3S10 phos-phorylation is affected by a given modification, thatmodification should be disproportionately represented inthe H3S10-phosphorylated tails (cf. the H3 tails as awhole). Indeed, acetylation of H3 at K9 or K14 was un-derrepresented by ∼10-fold in H3S10-phosphorylated
tails (0.22% as compared with 2.6% in the total H3 pool).In contrast, we observed a similar level of H3K9Me intotal H3 tail peptides (22.6%) as in H3S10-phosphory-lated peptides (24.8%), suggesting that H3S10 phos-phorylation is not affected by methylation of K9. More-over, we could not detect any S10 phosphorylated, dou-bly acetylated H3 tail peptide with current MS detectionlimits (Supplementary Fig. 8c; the calculated mass is561.2708 m/z), although it is possible that the double
acetyl/phospho-peptide exists at extremely low levelsthat may be detected with higher sensitivity immunoas-say methods (Kruhlak et al. 2001). These data, while cor-relative, are consistent with the conclusion that acety-lation of H3 tails interferes with phosphorylation of theH3 tails, and, thus, hypoacetylation of H3 tails appearsto be a prerequisite for mitotic H3S10 phosphorylation.
The H3S10 kinase Aurora B is present in HDAC3
complexes during mitosis
Thus far we have demonstrated that AKAP95/HA95 –
HDAC3-dependent histone deacetylation correlates
with the mitotic phosphorylation of H3S10. We hypoth-esized that the mechanism underlying this phenomenoninvolved Aurora B, the kinase that phosphorylatesH3S10 during mitosis (Crosio et al. 2002; Meraldi et al.2004). Indeed, we noted that Aurora B is associated withthe HDAC3 complex during mitosis (Fig. 2B), and thatafter gel filtration of purified HDAC3 complexes, AuroraB is present in the high-molecular-weight fractions thatalso contain AKAP95/HA95 and SMRT (Fig. 2E). Thus,Aurora B is a present in high-molecular-weight HDAC3complexes.
Hypoacetylated H3 is the preferred substrate
for Aurora B kinase
Consistent with a previous report (Shindo et al. 1998),
Aurora B level is increased in cells arrested in mitosis(Supplementary Fig. 9). However, depletion of AKAP95/HA95 or HDAC3 had little effect on Aurora B expression(Supplementary Fig. 9). We therefore hypothesized thatthe HDAC3-dependence of H3S10 phosphorylation wasdue to preferential phosphorylation of hypoacetylatedH3 tails by Aurora B. This hypothesis was tested usingan in vitro kinase assay to compare the ability of purifiedrecombinant Aurora B to phosphorylate H3S10 in hyper-acetylated versus hypoacetylated histone substrates. Wefirst confirmed that H3S10 phosphorylation level waslow and similar in the preparations of hypoacetylatedand hyperacetylated histones (Supplementary Fig. 10).Consistent with our hypothesis, Aurora B more effi-ciently phosphorylates the hypoacetylated histone sub-strate, although its autophosphorylation was the sameunder both conditions (Fig. 8A).
We also examined whether the presence of the
HDAC3/SMRT complex would facilitate S10 phos-phorylation by native Aurora B complex purified from293T cells. The result indicated that incubation of thepurified HDAC3/SMRT complex with purified endog-enous Aurora B kinase complex dramatically increasedthe phosphorylation of H3S10 in an in vitro kinase assay(Fig. 8B). This result was not an artifact of the Westerndetection of H3S10 phosphorylation interfered by acety-lation of H3, because in vitro deacetylation of the hyper-acetylated histones using recombinant HDAC3/SMRTcomplex after the kinase assay did not increase the phos-phorylation signal (Supplementary Fig. 11). Taken to-gether, these data suggest that Aurora B kinase preferen-tially phosphorylates hypoacetylated H3. Based on theseobservations, we reason that hypoacetylated H3 is thepreferred substrate for Aurora B kinase during mitosis,

The AKAP95/HA95–HDAC3–Aurora B pathway
is required for HP1/H9252 dissociation during mitosis
The physiological function of mitotic H3S10 phosphory-lation has been recently clarified by the recent findingthat Aurora B phosphorylation of H3S10 results in thedissociation of HP1 proteins, notably HP1/H9252, despite per-sistent H3K9 trimethylation (Fischle et al. 2005; Hirotaet al. 2005). We hypothesized that the AKAP95/HA95 –
HDAC3–Aurora B pathway we have uncovered is up-stream of this “meth-phos switch.” Indeed, the overall
decrease in H3S10 phosphorylation after knockdown ofeither HDAC3 or AKAP95/HA95 also occurs on H3 tailsin which H3K9 is trimethylated, although the overalltrimethylation of H3K9 was unchanged in HDAC3 orAKAP95/HA95 knockdown cells (Fig. 9A). Knockdownof HDAC1, which did not change acetylation levels ofhistones from mitotic-arrested cells, also did not reducethis double modification (Supplementary Fig. 3b).If the AKAP95/HA95–HDAC3–Aurora B pathway is,
indeed, a prerequisite for normal mitotic H3S10 phos-phorylation leading to HP1/H9252 dissociation, then knock-
down of the individual components of this pathwayshould result in retention of HP1 /H9252on mitotic chromatin.
To test this hypothesis, HeLa cells were transfected withshHDAC3 or shAKAP95/shHA95 constructs, thenstained with anti-HP1/H9252 after extraction of the soluble
proteins to reduce the interference from soluble non-chromatin-bound proteins. As expected, in cells treatedwith control shRNA, HP1/H9252 was not extracted from in-
terphase cells, but was completely extracted from mi-totic cells (Fig. 9B, arrow). In contrast, HP1/H9252 was re-
tained by mitotic chromatin in cells depleted of HDAC3or AKAP95/HA95 (Fig. 9B). This was very similar to theeffect of pharmacological inhibition of Aurora B usinghesperadin, the hallmark of the “meth-phos switch”
(Fischle et al. 2005; Hirota et al. 2005), which we alsoobserved (Fig. 9C). These results demonstrate that nor-mal HP1 dissociation from mitotic chromosomes re-quires the HDAC3–AKAP95/HA95–Aurora B pathway,acting upstream of the H3S10-phosphorylation-depen-dent displacement of HP1 from heterochromatin. Theyfurther predict that HDAC inhibitors acting on thispathway to induce mitotic arrest should cause HP1 /H9252re-
tention. Indeed, the dissociation of HP1/H9252 from mitotic

Discussion
The classic role of HDAC3 has been that of a transcrip-
tional repressor of gene expression, as part of a complextethered to sequence-specific transcription factors. Herewe have reported the unexpected finding that HDAC3has a critical, transcription-independent function in mi-tosis. In interphase cells, AKAP95/HA95 binds to thenuclear matrix (Collas et al. 1999; Martins et al. 2000;Akileswaran et al. 2001) and is less associated withHDAC3. HP1 proteins are recruited to methylated H3K9in heterochromatin. When cells enter into mitosis,AKAP95/HA95 may target the HDAC3 complex todeacetylate H3, in a reaction that is blocked by HDACinhibitors, and thereby provides a hypoacetylated H3 tailas substrate for Aurora B to phosphorylate on S10. Phos-phorylation of S10 by Aurora B then dissociates HP1 pro-teins from methylated H3K9 residues on mitotic hetero-chromatin, which has been referred to as the “meth-phos
switch” (Fischle et al. 2005; Hirota et al. 2005). These
interdependent changes in histone modification and pro-tein association are required for normal progres-sion through mitosis, perhaps by facilitating chromo-some condensation, or by serving as the indicator forthe mitotic checkpoint to control proper cell division(Fig. 10).
While the transcriptional effect of HDAC inhibitors
on specific genes, such as p21 and other cell cycle-regu-lated genes, has been reported to contribute to their anti-tumor actions, especially in G1-phase arrest (Archer etal. 1998; Sambucetti et al. 1999; Xiao et al. 1999; Richonet al. 2000; Johnstone 2002), their direct effects on his-tone acetylation levels may be equally important for theanti-tumor activity because of the important functionsof histones in different cellular processes, including mi-tosis (Johnstone and Licht 2003). It is increasingly clearthat HDAC inhibition induces G2/M arrest in many hu-man cell lines and causes mitotic defects in differentcancer cell lines (Qiu et al. 2000; Taddei et al. 2001; Baliet al. 2005; Dowling et al. 2005; Nome et al. 2005; Wonget al. 2005). We have confirmed this and, furthermore,find that this effect of HDAC inhibition is independentof ongoing gene transcription, suggesting direct effects ofhistone hyperacetylation on mitosis. Our results indi-cate that the hyperacetylation of histones induced byHDAC inhibitors directly interfere with mitotic progres-sion.
Global histone acetylation is reduced during mitosis
(Marian and Wintersberger 1982; Jeppesen et al. 1992;Kruhlak et al. 2001; Chen et al. 2005; Li et al. 2005; Vallset al. 2005; Nishiyama et al. 2006). Our studies revealthat HDAC3 and its partner proteins AKAP95 and HA95are required for global histone deacetylation during mi-tosis. Of note, the most dramatic change in acetylationthat occurs during mitosis is hypoacetylation of Lys 5 ofH4 (Kruhlak et al. 2001), which matches the substratespecificity of HDAC3 (Hartman et al. 2005). Moreover,our results clearly show that HDAC3 is required for nor-mal mitotic progression. This is consistent with a recentstudy in which knockdown of HDAC3, but not HDAC1or HDAC2, increased cells in G2/M phase in human coloncancer cells (Wilson et al. 2006). Furthermore, knock-down of HDAC3 or AKAP95/HA95 also mimicked theeffects of nonselective HDAC inhibition on phosphory-lation of H3S10 and retention of HP1/H9252 proteins on mi-
totic chromosomes. Inhibition of HDAC3 is thereforelikely to be the mechanism by which HDAC inhibitorsinduce the G2/M block in the cell cycle. The transcrip-tion independence of this effect, while unexpected, iscompletely consistent with a direct mitotic function ofHDAC3 in the context of the novel pathway that wereport here.
Specific patterns of histone modification at gene pro-
moters regulate transcription via a “histone code” (Jenu-
wein and Allis 2001). Notably, the transient phosphory-lation of H3S10 has been reported in the promoter regionof many mammalian immediate-early genes, which are
Figure 10. The HDAC3–AKAP95/HA95–Aurora B pathway
regulating mitosis. In interphase cells, AKAP95/HA95 binds to
the nuclear matrix (Mikhailov et al. 2004). HP1 proteins arerecruited to the heterochromatin by interaction with methyl-ated H3K9. When cells enter into mitosis, AKAP95/HA95 re-cruits HDAC3 along with Aurora B. HDAC3-mediated histonedeacetylation enhances the H3S10 kinase activity of Aurora B.This step is blocked by HDAC inhibitors. Aurora B-catalyzedphosphorylation of H3S10 dissociates HP1 from mitotic chro-mosomes via the “meth-phos switch” (Fischle et al. 2005; Hi-
rota et al. 2005). This pathway is required for normal progres-sion through mitosis.Li et al.
2574 GENES & DEVELOPMENT Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press  on August 29, 2024 - Published by genesdev.cshlp.org Downloaded from rapidly induced in response to extracellular stimuli in-
cluding UV radiation, growth factors, and cytokines(Bode and Dong 2005). On these promoters, the phos-phorylation of H3S10 precedes the H3K14 acetylation,resulting in multiple modifications of H3 that facilitategene activation (Cheung et al. 2000a; Lo et al. 2000,2001). On the contrary, we found that the phosphoryla-tion of H3S10 by Aurora B during mitosis requires theprevious deacetylation of histones by HDAC3. Thus, incontrast to the phosphorylation of H3S10 by other ki-nases that prefer preacetylated histone tails, the mitoticphosphorylation of H3S10 by Aurora B kinase is linkedto the deacetylation of H3, specifically by HDAC3. Thischaracteristic of Aurora B may be specific to metazoansbecause IPL1, the yeast homolog of Aurora kinase, phos-phorylated both monoacetylated and unacetylated H3(Rea et al. 2000). In addition to H3S10, Aurora B alsophosphorylates H3S28 and other proteins including his-tone H3 variant centromere protein A (CENP-A) (Goto etal. 1999, 2002; Zeitlin et al. 2001; Kunitoku et al. 2003).In the human cell systems we have studied, Aurora Balso seems to prefer hypoacetylated H3 and CENP-A H3as substrate for phosphorylation of H3S28 and CENP-ASer7, respectively (Y. Li and M.A. Lazar, unpubl.). Theglobal hypoacetylation of H3 tail lysines in mitotic cellsand their proximity to the major sites of phosphorylationby Aurora B kinase suggest that deacetylation of histonesubstrates may be a general preference for Aurora B func-tion. The relative importance of specific hypoacetylatedlysines for phosphorylation of specific serine residues re-mains to be elucidated.
The specificity of Aurora B toward hypoacetylated
histone substrate suggests a mechanistic link betweenHDAC3-dependent histone deacetylation and a tran-scription-independent mechanism of mitotic arrest.H3S10 phosphorylation during mitosis is character-istic of many organisms (Wei et al. 1999; Crosio et al.2002), and is dependent on Aurora B kinase, whichplays a central role throughout different stage of mitosis,including chromosome condensation, alignment, andsegregation, spindle assembly, and cytokinesis (Schu-macher et al. 1998; Giet and Glover 2001; Hauf et al.2003; Gimenez-Abian et al. 2004). The recent find-ing that Auroradependent phosphorylation of H3S10dissociates HP1 from mitotic heterochromatin pro-vides molecular insight into the function of Aurora B(Fischle et al. 2005; Hirota et al. 2005). Our findingsimplicate AKAP95/HA95 and HDAC3 as upstreamregulators of this “meth-phos switch” (Fischle et al.
2003), and provide a molecular mechanism to ex-plain the anti-cancer effects of HDAC inhibitors. AuroraB kinase itself is overexpressed in a large number ofcancers (Takahashi et al. 2000; Sorrentino et al. 2005).Our finding that Aurora B is present in HDAC3complexes and that its kinase activity is dramaticallygreater when the H3 tail is hypoacetylated suggeststhat the interdependence of Aurora B and HDAC3 maybe a novel and specific target for cancer therapies thatwould overcome the toxicity of nonspecific HDAC in-hibitors.Materials and methods
Plasmids and reagents
Full-length AKAP95 andHA95 were obtained from HeLa cells
by RT–PCR and cloned into pcDNA3.1A vector (Invitrogen).
HA-epitope tags were added to the N terminus of HA95 and theC terminus of AKAP95. The pTRE-HDAC3-Flag expression vec-tor was constructed by inserting HDAC3-Flag (Guenther et al.2001) into the pTRE vector (BD Clontech). The SMRT DADdomain or SMRT 1–763, fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding do-main, were described previously (Yu et al. 2003). Anti-HA95 andAKAP95 antibodies were raised against KLH-conjugated pep-tides HA95 (amino acids 65–85) and AKAP95 (amino acids 672–688) and affinity-purified. Anti-GPS2 antibody was raisedagainst the peptide from 307 to 327 (Covance). N-CoR and TBL1antibodies were described previously (Huang et al. 2000; Guen-ther et al. 2001). Other antibodies were purchased as follows:H4, H3ac, H4ac, H3S10ph, and H3K9me3S10ph from UpstateBiotechnology; H3, H3K9acS10ph, anti-HDAC3 (rabbit), andanti-Aurora B from Abcam; anti-HDAC3 (mouse), anti-SMRT,and anti-Ran from BD PharMingen; mouse anti-HDAC3 for im-munoprecipitation from Upstate Biotechnology (clone 3G6);anti-SMRT/N-CoR from Affinity Bioreagents; anti-GAPDHfrom Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-Tcp1/H9252 from Stressgen
Biotechnologies; anti-Flag from Sigma; and anti-HA tag fromRoche Applied Science. TSA, sodium butyrate, VPA, nocodazole,paclitaxel, and aphidicolin were purchased from Sigma.
Cell line establishment and culture conditions
293T, HeLa, and MCF7 cells were kept in DMEM with 10%
FBS. The 293T tet-off cell line (BD Clontech) was transfectedwith pTRE-HDAC3-Flag or pTRE empty vector and selectedunder 50 µg/mL hygromycin in DMEM with 5% FBS. Positiveclones were confirmed by Western blot. The HDAC3-Flag ex-pression level of the selected clone was about five times higherthan endogenous HDAC3 (data not shown). The HDAC3 stablecell lines were kept in DMEM with either 5% tet-approved FBS(BD Clontech) to express HDAC3-Flag or 5% FBS with 2 µg/mLDoxycycline (Sigma) to turn off HDAC3 expression.
Affinity purification and gel filtration
Flag-HDAC3 stable cell pellets were resuspended in BC100
buffer (20 mM HEPES, 100 mM KCl, 0.2% NP-40, 0.2 mMEDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mM DTT, protease inhibitor cocktail[Roche]) followed by brief sonication to lyse the cells. Whole-cell lysates were incubated with anti-Flag M2 agarose (Sigma) inBC100 buffer overnight at 4°C. After extensive washing withBC100 and BC300 (20 mM HEPES, 300 mM KCl, 0.2% NP-40,0.2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mM DTT), associated com-plexes were eluted by 0.5 mg/mL Flag peptide (Sigma) or 0.2mg/mL 3xFlag peptide (Sigma) in BC100 buffer or BC100 with-out NP-40 (for gel filtration). For gel filtration, eluents wereconcentrated to 0.15 mL on an Ultrafree cellulose concentrationdevice (Millipore). The samples were loaded on a Superose 610/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Bioscience) in BC150(150 mM KCl) without NP-40. Eluents were collected at 0.5 mLper fraction. Fractions from the Superose 6 column were sub-jected to immunoblot analysis.
Protein identification
Protein identification by mass spectrometry was performed as
described (Jung et al. 2005).AKAP–HDAC3–Aurora B–HP1 pathway regulates mitosis

Cells were lysed with BC100 for 10 min on ice followed by brief
sonication. After centrifugation, the supernatants were pre-cleared with protein A agarose, and then allowed to bind eitheranti-HDAC3 or anti-HA95 and anti-AKAP95 overnight at 4°C.
Protein A agarose beads were added and incubated for another 2h. The beads were washed five times in BC100 and once inBC300 and subjected to immunoblot analysis. For in vitro bind-ing assays, Flag-HDAC3 and Gal-SMRT(1–763) were in vitrotranslated with the T7 TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) and incubated with anti-Flag M2agarose (Sigma) in BC100 buffer overnight at 4°C. HDAC3-coupled beads were collected and incubated with in vitro trans-lated,
35S-labeled HA95 or AKAP95, which were precleared
with anti-Flag M2 agarose in BC100 buffer. After extensivewashing, bound proteins were subjected to autoradiography andimmunoblot analysis.
shRNA transfection
Vectors expressing shRNA under the control of the human H1
promoter were constructed by inserting pairs of annealed DNAoligonucleotides into the pSuper vector (Oligoengine) betweenBglII and HindIII restriction sites or pSilenser vector (for HDAC1and control for HDAC1; Ambion). The target sequences wereas follows: nontargeted control: 5/H11032-AGACACACGCACTCGTCTC-3/H11032 ; HA95-1: 5/H11032 -CCCAGCCATCTTGACAGCAA-3 /H11032; AKAP95-1:
5/H11032-GCCAGGAGCACTTCTTCAA-3/H11032; HDAC1, HDAC3 con-
trol for HDAC1: see Ishizuka and Lazar (2003).
293T or HeLa cells were transfected with shRNAs using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Gibco) according to the manu-facturer’s instructions. Cells were divided 24 h after transfec-tion, followed by a second transfection 24 h later with the sameshRNA constructs. Cells were split after an additional 24 hincubation, and specific drugs were added at the indicated con-centration and collected at various time points.
In vitro kinase assay and HDAC assay
One microgram of sodium-butyrate-treated (hyperacetylated) or
untreated histones from HeLa cells (Upstate Biotechnology) wasincubated with 2.5 U of active Aurora B (Upstate Biotechnology)in TAB kinase buffer (Upstate Biotechnology) for 10 min at30°C. The reaction included either Mg
2+ATP cocktail (Upstate
Biotechnology) or 0.2 µCi of [/H9253-32P]ATP plus Mg2+ATP cocktail.
The reactions were stopped by addition of 2× SDS loading buffer
and boiling for 5 min at 95°C. Phosphorylation of histones wasdetected by Western blot or autoradiography. After kinase as-say, the samples were diluted with HDAC buffer together withbeads alone or anti-Flag agarose-immobilized HDAC3 andSMRT DAD, which are overexpressed in 293T cells. HDACassay was performed as described previously (Yu et al. 2003). Invitro kinase assays were also performed using affinity-purifiedAurora B complex from 293T cells. Five micrograms of hyper-acetylated histones were incubated with immobilized HDAC3-SMRT DAD complex or beads alone at 37°C in TAB kinasebuffer. After 20 min of incubation, affinity-purified Aurora Bcomplex from 293T cells was added to the reactions with Mg
2+
ATP cocktail. The reactions were incubated for 15 min moreand stopped by addition of SDS loading buffer and boiling.
FACS
Cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and fixed with ice-
cold 70% ethanol overnight at 4°C. Nucleus DNA was stainedusing a solution with 50 µg/mL propidium iodide (Sigma) and 1mg/mL RNase A in PBS (Jin et al. 2002). The cells were analyzedon FACScalibur (BD Biosciences) using CellQuest and ModFitdata analysis software.
Immunofluorescence
For colocalization staining of AKAP95 and HDAC3, HeLa cells
cultured on Lab-TekII Chamber slides were washed three timesin PBS, fixed for 15 min in 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at roomtemperature, washed, and fixed with cold methanol for 5 min.After two additional washes, cells were incubated with blockingbuffer (5% donkey serum in PBS) for1ha troom temperature.Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and incu-bated with cells at 4°C overnight. After washing with PBS threetimes, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies conju-gated with either Alexa 594 or Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) for1 h at room temperature. Then DNA was stained with 0.1 mg/mL 4/H11032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma) for 15 min atroom temperature. After washing, slides were mounted withProlong Gold anti-fade reagent. Slides were viewed with a ZeissLSM-510 META confocal microscope, using LSM 510 version3.2 software to acquire images.
Alternatively, cells were cultured on chamber slides and in-
cubated with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room tem-perature to extract non-chromatin-bound proteins. After fixingand staining with indicated antibodies or DAPI, additional im-aging was performed with a 100× PlanNeofluor objective
mounted on a Nikon TE-200 microscope equipped with epifluo-rescence optics. With the latter, images were captured with aHammamatsu CCD camera that was controlled with IP Lab-Spectrum version 2.0.1 (Scanalytics, Inc.).
Mass spectrometry (MS)
The mass spectrometry data shown in Supplementary Figures 6
and 8 are summarized in Figures 6B and 7B. H3 from asynchro-nously grown and mitotically arrested HeLa cells were firstchemically derivatized with propionylation reagent (Aldrich) aspreviously described (Syka et al. 2004). H3 was dried to neardryness and redissolved in 25 µL of deionized water, dilutedwith 50 µL of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer solution(pH 8), and digested with trypsin (Promega) at a substrate:en-zyme ratio of 20:1 for5ha t3 7 °C. All reactions were quenched
by the addition of concentrated acetic acid and freezing. Propio-nylated histone digest mixtures were loaded onto capillary pre-columns packed with 5 cm of irregular C18 resin, washed with0.1% acetic acid, and connected to analytical columns packedwith 8 cm of regular C18 resin (5 µm; YMC, Inc.) constructedwith integrated electrospray emitters as previously published(Martin et al. 2000). All samples were analyzed by nanoflowHPLC-microelectrospray ionization on a Finnigan linear qua-drupole ion trap-Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance(LTQ-FT-ICR) mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron) as previ-ously described (Hake et al. 2006).
