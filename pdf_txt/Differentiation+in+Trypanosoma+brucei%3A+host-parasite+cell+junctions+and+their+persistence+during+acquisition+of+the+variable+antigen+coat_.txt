 17 
The long and complex  Trypanosoma brucei development in the tsetse fly vector culminates 18 
when parasites gain mammalian infectivity in the salivary gland s. A key step in this process  is 19 
the establishment of monoallelic variant surface glycoprotein ( VSG ) expression and the 20 
formation of the VSG coat. The e stablishment  of VSG  monoallelic expression is  complex  and 21 
poorly understood,  due to the multiple parasite stages present in the saliv ary glands. 22 
Therefore,  we sought to further our understanding of this phenomenon by performing  single - 23 
cell RNA -sequencing  (scRNA -seq) on these trypanosome populations . We were able to 24 
capture the developmental program of trypanosomes in the salivary glands , identifying  25 
populations of  epimastigote, gamete, pre -metacyclic and metacyclic cells. Our results show 26 
that parasite metabolism is dramatically remodeled during development in the salivary glands , 27 
with a shift in transcript abundance  from tricarboxylic a cid metabolism to glycolytic metabolism. 28 
Analysis of VSG gene expression in pre-metacyclic and metacyclic cells  revealed  a dynamic 29 
VSG gene activation  program . Strikingly,  we found  that pre -metacyclic  cells contain transcripts 30 
from multiple VSG  genes, whic h resolves to singular VSG  gene expression in mature 31 
metacyclic cells. Single molecule RNA  fluorescence in situ  hybridisation (smRNA -FISH)  of 32 
VSG  gene expression following in vitro  metacyclogenesis confirmed this finding.  Our data 33 
demonstrate that  multiple  VSG  genes are transcribed before a single gene is chosen. We 34 
propose a transcriptional race model govern s the initiation of  monoallelic expression.  35

African trypanosomes are single -cell flagellated parasites that cause Human African 38 
Trypano somias es, and nagana in cattle  in sub -Saharan Africa . The parasite s have a digenetic  39 
life cycle, cycling through a mammalian reservoir host and a tsetse fly ve ctor host. During t he 40 
developmental phase in the fly , the parasite  progresses through multiple st ages before 41 
acquiring mammalian infectivity in a process called metacyclogenesis in the salivary glan ds 42 
(Rotureau an d Van Den Abbeele 2013) . Trypanosome  cells can be classified into multiple 43 
stages grouped in two morphotypes: trypomastigote and epimastigote forms  (Figure 1 -figure 44 
supplement 1) , defined by the relative positions of the nuclear and mitochondrial (kinetop last) 45 
DNA within the cell  (Hoare and Wallace 1966) . Following a tsetse blood meal, the 46 
trypomastigote stumpy -form parasites ingested from the blood rapidly differentiate into 47 
trypomastigote procyclic form  (PCF) parasites which colonise the posterior midgut of the fly. 48 
Procyclic tr ypanosomes elongate and migrate through the alimentary tract to reach  the cardia 49 
(or proventriculus ), while differentiat ing into epimastigote forms.  50 
After a first asymmetric division, e pimastigote  parasite s then migrate to the salivary 51 
gland s where they a ttach to the epithelium via their flagellum and start proliferating  to colonise 52 
it (Van Den Abbeele, Claes et al. 1999, Sharma, Peacock et al. 2008) . This population of 53 
attached epimastigote  cells enter s another asymmetric division, producing trypomastigote pre- 54 
metacyclic  cells which then mature further to produce free mammalian -infective metacyclic  55 
cells that fill the lumen of the salivary glands and will be injected to the next host with the tsetse 56 
saliva  (Rotureau, Subota et al. 2012)  (Figure 1 -figure supplement 1) . The two  mitotic c ell 57 
divisions of attached epimastigote  cells, producing either an attached epimastigote or a pre- 58 
metacyclic trypomastigote daughter cell  occur continuously and in paralle l during the entire life 59 
of the tsetse, optimizing parasite transmission.  An additional heterogeneous parasite 60 
population is found in the salivary glands , compos ed of meiotic cells and gametes (Peacock, 61 
Ferris et al. 2011, Peacock, Bailey et al. 2014) . These processes lead to a heterogeneous 62 
population of cells within the salivary glands.  RNA binding proteins appear to be  the key 63 
regulators underpinning the trypanosome developmental program  (Kolev, Ullu et al. 2014) . For 64 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

overexpression of  RNA binding protein 6  (RBP6 ) is sufficient to drive differentiation to infective 66 
metacyclic  cells (Kolev, Ramey -Butler et al. 2012) .  67 
In addition to the dramatic  remodeling described above, trypanosomes modulate their 68 
energy metabolism in response to their specific environments (Smith, Bringaud et al. 2017) . In 69 
the mammalian host , parasites utilize glucose as a primary carbon source to produce ATP 70 
through the glycolytic pathway that is restricted in specialized organelles named glycosomes. 71 
In contrast, in the tsetse fly midgut, parasites mostly use proline to feed the mitochondria l 72 
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation pathways to produce ATP (review 73 
in Smith, Bringaud et al. (2017) ).  74 
A key step in  the metacy clogenesis  process is the establishment of monoallelic VSG  75 
gene  expression  (Tetley, Turner et al. 1987) . African trypanosomes have an exclusively 76 
extracellular lifecycle, meaning that in the mammalian host they are cont inually exposed to the 77 
immune system. To evade humoral immune attack , the parasite covers  its surface in a 78 
monolayer of 107 molecules of a single species of VSG protein which protects from 79 
complement mediated lysis (Cross 1975, Mosser and Roberts 1982) . It is put under continuous 80 
pressure to switch from the  adaptive  immune system, and the parasite evades this by antigenic 81 
variation, a process of VSG  switching (Horn 2014) .  82 
The epigenetic control of  monoallelic ex pression of VSG  genes underpins this antigenic 83 
variation  (Duraisingh and Horn 2016) . Transcription of VSG s is highly structured; VSG genes 84 
are always transcribed from a telomere proximal site known as a VSG -expression site ( VSG - 85 
ES), by RNA polymerase I (RNA Pol I) (Zomerdijk, Kieft et al. 1991, Gunzl, Bruderer et al. 86 
2003) . The genome has 19 bloodstream form VSG -ES which are polycistronic transcription 87 
units, and 8 monocistronic metacyclic VSG -ES (mVSG -ES) (Hertz -Fowler, Figueiredo et al. 88 
2008, Muller, Cosentino et al. 2018) . In addition, the trypanosome genome encodes several 89 
thousand  silent  VSG  genes and gene fragments in a sub-telomeric archive which hugely 90 
increases the antigen diversity availabl e for antigenic variation  (Berriman, Ghedin et al. 2005) . 91 
The single active VSG -ES is transcribed from a  sub-nuclear organelle called the expression 92 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

Transcription is 93 
initiated at all VSG -ES, however only elongates over a single VSG -ES (Kassem, Pays et a l. 94 
2014) . Maintenance of monoallelic VSG  expression depends on the VSG  Exclusion complex 95 
(VEX) complex , which associat es with the ESB (Glover, Hutchinson et al. 2016, Faria, Glover 96 
et al. 2019) , and  an mRNA trans -splicing locus , forming a transcription and splicing factory 97 
(Faria, Luzak et al. 2021) . In addition, several  chromatin factors, including  the sheltrin 98 
component  RAP1 and the histone chaperone CAF1 have been implic ated in  maintenance of  99 
monoallelic expression (Yang, Figueiredo et al. 2009, Alsford and Horn 2012, Faria, Glover et 100 
al. 2019) .  101 
The establishment of monoallelic expression in metacyclic trypanosomes is relatively  102 
poorly understood. Immunogold staining of salivary gland trypanosomes and double 103 
immunofluorescence staining of in vitro  derived metacyclic parasites demonstrates that 104 
monoallelic expression is established in the salivary glands of the tsetse  fly (Tetley, Turner et 105 
al. 1987, Ramey -Butler, Ullu et al. 2015) . In bloodstream parasites, monoallelic expression can 106 
undergo transcriptional switching events , where the active VSG -ES is switched off and a 107 
previously silent on e is activated epigenetically  (Horn 2014) , requiring the re -establishment of 108 
monoallelic expression. Analysis of BSF cells f ollowing a forced VSG -ES switch  showed that  109 
transcription transiently increased at silent  VSG -ES prior to switching the active VSG-ES. This 110 
was proposed as “probing” of silent VSG -ES before commitment to switching  (Aresta -Branco, 111 
Pimenta et al. 2016) . Only one factor has so -far been linked to the establishment of monoallelic 112 
expression; the histone methyltransferase DOT1b trimethylates H istone H 3 lysine 76 (Janzen, 113 
Hake et al. 2006)  and is required to switch of f a previously active VSG -ES following the 114 
establishment of a new active site (Figueiredo, Janzen et al. 2008) .  115 
The limiting nature  and diverse cellular composition of salivary gland trypanosomes 116 
has made these parasites  less experimentally  tractable  than in vitro  systems . These parasites 117 
are not amenable to axenic culture (metacyclic cells are G0 arrested), and genetic 118 
manipulation tools are not as well e stablished as  in culture d parasites.  We therefore applied a 119 
single -cell RNA -sequencing  (scRNA -seq) approach  to salivary gland derived trypanosomes , 120 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

to address the la ck of resolution in  these cell types . Here , we dissect the architecture of 122 
parasite development as they acquire mammalian infectivity in the salivary gland s using 123 
inDrop . InDrop is a scRNA -seq technology wherein  single cells are co-encapsulated inside 124 
nano liter droplets with single barcoded hydrogel microspheres (BHMs)  coupled to  barcod ed 125 
cDNA primers  that hybridize to the 3’ poly(A) tail of mRNA  (Figure 1A), allowing  sequencing of  126 
several thousand cells per experiment . Reverse transcription of mRNAs from e ach cell 127 
generates cDNAs tagged with a unique barcode, specific to each cell, permitting the informatic 128 
decomposition of single -cell transcriptomes  (Klein, Mazutis et al. 2015, Zilionis, Nainys et al. 129 
2017) . 130 
In thi s study, we first demonstrate d that trypanosomes are compatible with 3´ mRNA 131 
barcoding using inDrop BHMs.  After having generated  single cell transcriptomes for cultured 132 
bloodstream (BSF) and PCF trypanosomes , we performed inDrop with parasites from the 133 
salivary glands. This revealed the presence of 4 cell clusters in the salivary glands, 134 
corresponding to  1) attached epimastigote  cells, 2) gametes and meiotic  cells, 3) pre- 135 
metacyclic trypomastigote  cells and 4) metacyclic parasites. We delineate d transcripto mic 136 
changes to energy metabolism pathways, revealing a coherent developmental program in this 137 
organ towards infectivity. Finally, we have perform ed the first analysis of the establishment of 138 
monoallelic VSG expression in vivo . We show that the establishmen t of monoallelic expression 139 
is a two -step process, where pre -metacyclic cells first initiate expression of multiple mVSG  140 
transcripts , followed by monoallelic expression in metacyclic parasites.  We further validated 141 
this finding by an orthogonal method,  employing smRNA -FISH with parasites undergoing 142 
metacyclogenesis in vitro .  143

Assessment  of single -cell RNA -seq using  inDrop  applied t o Trypanosoma brucei  146 
To test whether trypanosomes would not be visibly stressed by the inDrop  pipeline, we 147 
monitored  the survival and RNA metabolism using  ALBA3  and DHH1 as markers for cellular 148 
stress  in procyclic form (PCF) cells , in conditions which mimic the inDrop protocol . Following 149 
starvation in PBS for 2 h  at 27 °C, ALBA3 and D HH1 form RNA granules  in the cytoplasm  150 
(Subota, Rotureau et al. 2011) , however when cells are placed on ice  for 2h in phosphate 151 
buffered saline , no RNA  granule  formation was observed ( Figure 1 -figure supplement 2A). In 152 
addition, c ells remained alive based on their motility after returning them to 27°C SDM -79 153 
medium (97 %  untreated  and 94 %  2h PBS)  (Figure 1 -figure supplement  2B), indicating  that 154 
they are not visibly stressed in the conditions required for inDrop .  155 
 We first characterized the performance of the inDrop  pipeline with cultured  Antat1. 1E 156 
PCF trypanosomes expressing EP (Glu-Pro) / GPEET  (Gly-Pro-Glu-Glu-Thr) repeat containing 157 
procyclins . T. brucei  mRNAs are poly -adenylated and therefore compatible with priming of 158 
cDNA synthesis using  poly(T)VN, so we began by performing ‘bulk’ experiments using  a primer  159 
containing  a T7 promoter  for cDNA amplification by in vitro  transcription (IVT) , an Illumina 160 
sequencing adaptor , a single inDrop cell barcode, unique molecular identifiers UMI (Islam, 161 
Zeisel et al. 2014)  and a poly(T)VN sequence for mRNA capture  (see Materials and Methods) . 162 
Library sequencing revealed that the majority of barcoded cDNA s corresponded to the 163 
annotated  3´-end of transcripts, as expected  (Figure 1 B). We therefore proceeded to single 164 
cell barcoding of trypanosomes. We mixed cultured BSF and PCF trypanosomes (47.5 % 165 
each) with Ramos cells  (5%) , a human B-cell line derived fro m Burkitt’s lymphoma  (Klein, 166 
Giovanella et al. 1975)  as a positive control.  The inclusion of Ramos cells also allows us to 167 
estimate the amount of ambient RNA within the cell suspension which is detec ted by inDrop.  168 
We constructed  a sequencing library, and generated 77.4 million  reads . To facilitate the use 169 
of trypanosome genomic sequences for which no reference strain is available, we developed 170 
a bespoke analysis pipeline to create a count matrix (see Materials and Methods). After 171 
processing the reads with this pipeline, we u sed the Seurat and single cell transform (SCT) R 172 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

Butler et al. 2019)  and determined that the transcriptomes of 1,979 cells  were captured , with 174 
an average of 2,195 UMIs and 1,347 genes per cell. The emulsion contained approximately 175 
4,900 cells, suggesting that we recovered approximately 40 % of the ce lls through inDrop. 176 
Dimensionality reduction using the  Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection  (UMAP ) 177 
algorithm  (L McInnes, J Healy et al. 2018)  revealed  three clusters which corresponded to the 178 
three  expected  cell types  in appro ximately  the expected proportions  (Figure 1 C), with 164 (8%) 179 
Ramos cells, 809 (41%) procyclic cells and 1,006 (51%) BSF cells. Within clusters, we 180 
detected an average of 1,932 UMI s and 1,211  genes for BSF , 2,268 UMI s and 1,258 genes  181 
for PCF cells  and an av erage of 3,447 UMI s and 2,627 genes  in Ramos cells  (Figure 1 D). 182 
Each trypanosome cell has between 20,000 -40,000 mRNA  molecules  per cell  (Haanstra, 183 
Stewart et al. 2008)  therefore these data are consistent with an mR NA capture efficiency 184 
between 4.8 % and 11.3 %, similar to the 7. 1 % reported by  Klein, Mazutis et al. (2015) . We 185 
next plotted percentage of human and trypanosome UMI s for each barcode (Figure 1 -figure  186 
supplement 2 C). This revealed that human barcodes contained higher proportions of 187 
trypanosome UMIs than the converse. We hypothesized that this was potentially due to 188 
trypanosome cell fragility which leads to release of trypanosome mRNAs from lysed cells . We 189 
therefore  modified our protocol to maintain cell suspensions on ice until the moment they are 190 
encapsulated (see Materials and Methods).  191 
Marker gene analysis for each cluster revealed significantly differentially expressed 192 
genes , corresponding to the known biology of each respective cell type . In the BSF cluster, 193 
marker genes included  surface proteins  such as the active VSG -2 (Tb427.BES40.22)  (Figure 194 
1E), GRESAG 4  (Tb927.7.6080 ), ISG65  (Tb927.2.3270 ), and GPI-PLC (Tb927.2.6000) , as 195 
well as transcripts involved in the glycolytic pathway, such as AOX  (Tb927.10.7090 ), ALD 196 
(Tb927.10.5620 ), and PYK1  (Tb927.10.14140 ), for example . The PCF cluster markers 197 
included the procyclic surface markers EP1 (Tb927.10.10260 ) (Figure 1 E), EP2 198 
(Tb927.10.10250),  GPEET  (Tb927.6.510 ) and PARP A /EP3 -2 (Tb927.6.450 ), the elect ron 199 
transport chain component COXIV  (Tb927.1.4100 ), an amino acid transporter  (AAT10 -2) 200 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

(Tb927.10.10980 ), all of which are seen to be up-regulated in PCF using  bulk RNA -seq (Siegel, 202 
Hekstra et al. 2010) . In the Ramos cluster , markers included  genes such as  immunoglobulin 203 
lambda constant 3 ( IGLC3 ) (Figure 1 E) and prothymyosin alpha ( PTMA ), as expected . These 204 
data correspond with known biology from bulk transcripto mics experiments and therefore 205 
demonstrate that inDrop  is capable of single -cell analysis of trypanosome transcripts.  206 
  207 
Single -cell analysis of trypanosome  salivary gland transcriptomes  using inDrop  208 
 We next proceeded to single -cell barcoding of trypanoso mes from tsetse fly salivary 209 
glands. We  infected cages of 50 teneral (1-2 days post -eclosion) male tsetse flies with in vitro 210 
generated stumpy -form Antat1.1 E (EATRO1125)  T. b. brucei  and recovered salivary gland 211 
parasites by dissection 28 days post infecti on. We obtained 4.6 x104 parasites from a total of 212 
72 dissected flies (Figure 2 -figure supplement 1 ). We then generated and sequenced single - 213 
cell barcod ed libraries  (Figure 2 -figure supplement 2A ), and developed an optimized 214 
bioinformatic pipeline for T. brucei , recovering data for  2,279 cells  from two technical replicates 215 
(Figure 2 and Figure 2 -figure supplement 2B ), detect ing an average of 959 UMIs per replicate  216 
(Figure 2 -supplement 2B ). As no genome sequence is available for the Antat1.1 strain  used 217 
here, we identified VSG genes expressed in the salivary gland s by the Antat1.1 strain by 218 
aligning reads to the VSG nome for Antat1.1 E (EATRO1125)  (Cross 2017) . We then selected 219 
the top 8 sequences, in line with the reported number of mVSG -ES in the Lister -427 strain  220 
(Muller, Cosentino et al. 2018) .  221 
 We used the Seurat R package to analyze our technical replicates  (Butler, Hoffman et 222 
al. 2018, Hafemeister and Satija 2019) . Count matrices were compiled from all aligned reads, 223 
except for VSG  genes, where we used a stringent mapping quality  (MapQ40) , to avoid mis - 224 
aligned reads being spuriously counted . We next examined several technical aspects of 225 
inDrop, Firstly, we examined the background from ambient RNA by looking at the detection 226 
rate in a cluster of Ramos cells, which were incorporated into our  experiment . These data 227 
show ed that we d id not detect more than 2 mVSG  UMIs per barcode in Ramos cells (Figure 228 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

We therefore applied a >2 UMI cutoff for our mVSG  analyses below . 229 
We established the percentage of stringently aligned reads (mapping quality >40) in our data. 230 
This showed improvement over our in vitro data, with two distinct clusters of cells for human 231 
and trypanosome UMIs (Figure 2-figure supplement 3B). We next considered whether 232 
sequencing errors could contribute to barcode switching. Our bioinformatics pipeline permits 233 
up-to two errors per cell barcode, so we compared the edit distance between all cell barcodes 234 
in our study. The mean editing distance between barcodes was 11.4 nt, and only 0.017 % of 235 
barcode pairs were within an editing distance of 2 (Figure 2-figure supplement 3C). These 236 
parameters allowed us to effectively estimate the noise for our downstream analyses.  237 
Following data preprocessing and integration of the technical replicates, we visualized 238 
the datasets using UMAP projections (L McInnes, J Healy et al. 2018) (Figure 2A). Clustering 239 
identified 5 clusters (Figure 2B), whose developmental state could be identified using known 240 
marker genes (Figure 1E). EP1 Procyclin (Tb927.10.10260) is a surface protein found in 241 
midgut forms (Roditi, Carrington et al. 1987), and its transcript can also be detected in salivary 242 
gland parasites (Urwyler, Studer et al. 2007). Brucei alanine-rich protein (BARP, 243 
Tb927.9.15640) is a surface protein present in attached epimastigote parasites (Urwyler, 244 
Studer et al. 2007). Metacyclic VSG expression is a marker for metacyclic cells (Rotureau, 245 
Subota et al. 2012), and VSG -393 is the most abundant VSG  transcript expressed in our 246 
dataset. RBP6 (Tb927.3.2930) is an RNA binding protein which drives developmental 247 
progression to infectivity in salivary glands, and is found in epimastigote forms in the salivary 248 
glands (Kolev, Ramey-Butler et al. 2012, Vigneron, O'Neill et al. 2020). Calflagin is a flagellar 249 
calcium binding protein whose expression is up-regulated in pre-metacyclic and metacyclic 250 
forms (Rotureau, Subota et al. 2012). Finally, HAP2 (Tb927.10.10770) is a membrane- 251 
membrane fusion protein found conserved in nature and expressed in the gametes of many 252 
species (Figure 2C) (Fedry, Liu et al. 2017). Further evidence from bulk transcriptomics of 253 
midgut, cardia (proventriculus) or salivary gland tissues (Kolev, Ramey-Butler et al. 2012) were 254 
used to identify midgut forms. Of the 226 marker genes identified for the midgut forms cluster 255 
in our inDrop data, 82.3 % of genes were maximally expressed in the midgut samples of bulk 256 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

we identified 142 midgut forms, 296 attached epimastigote  cells, 280 gametes, 317 pre - 258 
metacyclic and 1,244 metacyclic cells.  These data indica te that we are able to capture single 259 
cell transcriptomes of these salivary gland parasites, and identify cell states from these 260 
transcriptomes, using inDrop . 261

Metabolic transcript analysis reveals dramatic remodeling during metacyclogenesis  263 
 To further ou r understanding of developmental changes in the salivary glands, we 264 
assessed the expression of glycoly sis and TCA cycle genes expressed in the transcriptomes  265 
of parasites  from the salivary glands . Our analysis reveals that parasites remodel the 266 
expression of metabolic enzymes during differentiation to metacyclic cells (Figure 3, and 267 
Figure 3 -figure supplement 1 ). We were able to assess the expression changes for 12 268 
glycolysis enzyme transcripts and 7 TCA cycle transcripts (Figure 3A). We observed a 269 
common e xpression profile for most  genes  at the cluster  (Figure 3B and Figure 3 -figure 270 
supplement 1) and single cell level (Figure 3C) . Glycolytic enzymes increased in their 271 
expression between pre -metacyclic and metacyclic clusters, with hexokinase ( HK1, 272 
Tb927.10. 2010) and ATP-dependent 6 -phosphofructokinase  (PFK, Tb927.3.3270) being clear 273 
examples of this. We observed a decline in TCA cycle enzyme expression during 274 
metacyclogenesis, with pre -metacyclic cells positioned as a clear intermediate stage between 275 
epimast igote forms (Attached and Gametes) and metacyclic  cells. For instance,  aconitase  276 
(ACO , Tb927.10.14000) and glycosomal isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH, Tb927.11.900) both 277 
decrease from their peak expression in attached epimastigote  cells to their lowest in me tacyclic  278 
parasite s with pre-metacyclic  cells as intermediate s. This indicate s that the data clustering is 279 
indeed reflecting the true developmental progression of these cells, consistent with previous 280 
electron microscopy observations on glycosomal and mitoc hondrial remodeling during this 281 
development  (Tetley and Vickerman 1985, Kolev, Ramey -Butler et al. 2012) .  282

producing gamete  cells that can recombine  sexually (Peacock, Ferris et al. 2011) . HAP2  286 
expression has not been previously profiled during parasite development in the salivary gland s. 287 
In our data, e xpression  of HAP2  was significantly upregula ted in gamete  cells compared to the 288 
other clusters  (average log2 FC 0.74, detected in 82.5 % gamete  cells and 36.6 % cells in 289 
other clusters , adjusted p.val = 0.  9.75 x 10-50, neg ative binomial test, Supplementary table 1) . 290 
Additionally, and unexpectedly , BARP  expression was significantly reduced in these cells  291 
compared to gamete cells  (average log2 FC -0.83, detected in  94.6 % attached epimastigote  292 
cells and  61.1 % gamete  cells, adjusted p.val = 9.68 x 10-36, negative  binomial test) and EP1 293 
procyclin  expre ssion up -regulated ( average log2 FC 1.45, detected in 58.1% and 87.5% of 294 
attached epimastigote  cells and gamete cells, respectively, adjusted p.val = 3.26 x 10-56), 295 
potentially explaining the presence of these transcripts in previous studies  (Urwyler, Studer et 296 
al. 2007) . We also detected a significant up -regulation of  the game tocytogenesis marker  HOP1  297 
(Tb927. 10.5490)  (Peacock, Ferris et al. 2011)  in this cluster  compared to the other clusters 298 
(average log2 FC 0.80,  detected in 7.5 % gamete cells and 1.8 % cells in other clusters, 299 
adjusted p.val = 1.54 x 10-4). These data therefore support the assignment of gamete cel ls to 300 
this cluster.  301 
 Attached epimastigote  cells undergo asymmetrical division to produce one attached 302 
epimastigote daughter and one pre -metacyclic trypomastigote daughter (Rotureau, Subota et 303 
al. 2012) . We examined these cells in more detail (Figure 4A). We searched for cells 304 
expressing the histones ( H1 Tb927.11.1800, H2A Tb927.7.2820, H2B Tb927.10.10460, H3 305 
Tb927.1.2430 and H4 Tb927.5.4170), as a p roxy for S -phase cells (Ersfeld, Docherty et al. 306 
1996), and discovered two sub -clusters of cells expressing these transcripts (Figure 4B). To 307 
investigate this more quantitatively , we sub -divided the S -Phase cluster and assessed the 308 
marker genes expressed in these clusters (Figure 4 C). This revealed that BARP and the set 309 
of 5 canonical histones were significantly associated with the “BARP -S” cluster. HAP2  was 310 
significantly associated with both clusters, albeit more strongly with the HAP2 -S cluster  311 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

The presence of these two clusters  raises the questions as to 312 
whether there are two potential modes of development in the salivary glands.  313 
 314 
Establishment of mVSG  monoallelic expression  315 
 VSG  protein  expression is initiated during pre -metacyclic to metacyclic differentiation  316 
(Tetley and Vickerman 1985, Rotureau, Subota et al. 2012) . Consistent with this, o ur data 317 
revealed, as expected, the presence of very  few mVSG  UMIs in attached epimastigote  cells 318 
with 85% of cells containing no detectable mVSG  transcripts, compared to pre -metacyclic and 319 
metacyclic  clusters  (Figure 5 -figure supplement 1 ). Using our Ramos cell data to estimate the 320 
amount of ambient RNA  in the cell suspension  detected by inDrop, we found that attached 321 
epimastigote cells  contain ed more mVSG  UMIs on average than Ramos cells , where the se 322 
gene s are  not present  (3.36 vs 0.19 UMI s per cell, respectively) , suggesting that there is some 323 
transcription of these loci, consistent with ubiquitous transcription initiation from RNA -Pol I 324 
promoters (Kassem, Pays et al. 2014) . We observed an increase in the average number of 325 
mVSG  UMIs per cell as parasites proceeded through their developmental program (Figure 5 - 326 
figure supplement 1), increasing from a mean of 3.36  UMIs in attached epimastigote cells to 327 
10.0 UMIs and 21.7 UMIs in pre -metacyclic  and metacyclic cells , respectively.  328 
We next assessed the  diversity of  mVSG  expression during the differentiation process . 329 
Plotting the expression profile of individual pre-metacyclic cells  showed that the majority of 330 
cells in this cluster express multiple different mVSG  genes (Figure 5A). We quantified the 331 
number of different mVSG  genes expressed  per cell (i.e. the diversity of UMIs per cell)  in cells 332 
with more than 10 mVSG  UMIs. This revealed, strikingly, that pre -metacyclic cells express ed 333 
up-to six different mVSG  genes . Multi-mVSG  gene expression  (UMI cutoff >2 ) was observed 334 
in 86.7 % of cells , whereas only 13.3 % expressed a single mVSG  gene. (Figure 5B) . Following 335 
differe ntiation to metacyclic form cells, however, mVSG  expression had resolved into a 336 
monoallelic state  (Figure 5C) , where a single mVSG  gene was detected in 86.8 % of cells , 337 
12.2 % contained two mVSG  genes and only 1 % expressed 3 genes types  (Figure  5D).  338 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted March 1, 2021. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.01.433049doi: bioRxiv preprint We queried whether the detection of multiple mVSG  genes in pre -metacyclic cells was 339 
a function of sequencing depth for those barcodes, compared to metacyclic cells . We plotted  340 
the number of VSG  detected per barcode against the number of aligned reads, stratifi ed by 341 
cluster  (Figure 5 -figure supplement 2 ). This  revealed that rather than having higher aligned 342 
read counts, the median aligned reads per barcode associated to pre -metacyclic cells was 343 
lower than metacyclic cells, even when comparing metacyclic cells wi th a single  expressed  344 
mVSG  to pre -metacyclic  cells expressing 6 mVSG  genes (2.2 x 104 vs 1.6 x 104 median aligned 345 
reads, respectively) . These data show that it is highly unlikely that the detection of multiple 346 
mVSG  transcripts per cell is artefactual due t o sequencing depth .  347 
We sought to further validate our findings  by turning to previously published scRNA - 348 
seq data of salivary gland trypanosomes using both a different trypanosome strain ; RUMP503 , 349 
and a different technique, the 10xGenomics single -cell RNA -seq system (Vigneron, O'Neill et 350 
al. 2020) . As the complete set of mVSG  genes was not available for this strain, we used Trinity 351 
(Grabherr, Haas et al. 2011)  to assemble mVSG transcripts de novo  from bulk RNA -seq data 352 
(Savage, Kolev et al. 2016) , and retained the 8 most abundant mVSG  genes for downstream 353 
analysis. This allowed us to perform a detailed analysis of mVSG  expression in t hese data , 354 
which was not possible previously . We reprocessed the scRNA -seq data set using our pipeline, 355 
observing similar clusters to Vigneron, O'Neill et al. (2020)  (Figure 5 -figure supplement 3A,B) . 356 
We identified  a cluster of pre -metacyclic cells, in which we detected multi -mVSG  gene 357 
expression . In cells with more than 10 mVSG  UMIs, 71 % contained transcripts from multiple 358 
VSG genes (12 cells) , compared to 29 % with one  mVSG  detected  (UMI cutoff >2)  (Figure 5 - 359 
figure supplement 3 C). In the metacyclic cell cluster s, a single mVSG  gene was detected in 78 360 
% of cells, and 22 % of cells expressed two  or more  mVSG  genes, with the majority (86 %) of 361 
this subset expressing 2  mVSG  transcripts. This new finding is similar to our inDrop data,  362 
where 87 % of pre -metacyclic cells expressed more than a single  mVSG . These new analyses 363 
uncover that expression of multiple mVSGs  is a common precursor to monoallelic expression 364 
in different  trypanosome strains in vivo . 365 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted March 1, 2021. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.01.433049doi: bioRxiv preprint  To formally demon strate the existence of cells expressing more than a single VSG  366 
gene,  we performed  smRNA -FISH following in vitro  metacyclogenesis by overexpressing 367 
RBP6 . This in vitro  process models  the establishment of monoallelic mVSG expression  in a 368 
third strain, the  Lister 427 genetic background . Induction of RBP6 in PCF forms triggers 369 
differentiation first to epimastigote forms, which then further differentiate to trypomastigote 370 
forms, producing infective metacyclic forms which express a single mVSG  (Kolev, Ramey - 371 
Butler et al. 2012, Ramey -Butler, Ullu et al. 2015) . This process therefore allows us to model 372 
the initiation of mVSG  expression.  373 
We overexpressed RBP6 in PCF cells using a tetracycline inducible system  374 
(Trenaman, Glover et al. 2019) , and sampled cultures after 3, 4 or 5 days of induction. After 375 
probing for VSG -397, VSG -531 and alpha tubulin  as a positive control, w e detected VSG 376 
transcripts in ~5 % of cells (303 cells positive for VSG  out of a total of 6,452 ). Within  this 377 
population, w e established 3 categories of cells: “VSG+ ”, where transcript numbers were 378 
quantifiable  (193 cells) , “VSG++ ” where transcript numbers were too high to be quantif ied 379 
accurately (but w here individual  transcripts were discernable)  (18 cells),  and “VSG+++ ”, where 380 
individual transcripts were no longer discernable  (92 cells)  (for representative images see 381 
Figure 6A , Supplementary table 3 ).  382 
To visualize  the proportions of VSG -397 and VSG -531 transcripts p er cell , we 383 
estimated the total number of mVSG  transripts per cell in VSG++ and VSG+++ cat egories . 384 
BSF cells contain  on average 2,000 VSG  transcripts (Haanstra, Stewart et al. 2008) . Hence, 385 
we set the number of tra nscripts in VSG+++ cells at 2,000, and VSG++ cells at 200  (an order 386 
of magnitude between VSG+ and VSG++) per channel (i.e. if both VSG -397 and VSG -531 387 
were “VSG++” , we estimate that cell contains 400 VSG transcripts). Cells were therefore  388 
class ified as  VSG + with less than 200 transcripts, VSG++ with between 200 and 400 389 
transcripts , and VSG+++ with 2000  transcripts or more . We then assessed  singular VSG gene 390 
expression in each cell category: 30 % (58 cells) VSG+ cells contained transcripts from both 391 
VSG -397 and VSG -531, directly demonstrating the presence of cells expressing two different 392 
VSG  genes.  This proportion dropped to only 1 7 % (3 cells) among  VSG++  cells and 0 % in 393 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

Our data demonstrate  that the inDrop scRNA -seq approach is compatible with 398 
investigation of gene expression in trypanosomes . Despite significant biological constraints 399 
(limited access to multip le populations of parasites in low numbers), w e were able to delineate 400 
the developmental progression of these parasites in the salivary glands, including the 401 
identification of a gamete cluster.  In our hands, we detected  similar numbers of trypanosome 402 
UMIs (~2,000 for cultured cells)  compared  to Ramos  cells (~3,500) , despite having a much 403 
lower mRNA content per cell  (105 vs 104 for human and trypanosome cells, respectively ) 404 
(Haanstra, Stewart et al. 2008) .  405 
The gamet e cell cluster was characterized by a  significant upregulation of HAP2 , a 406 
conserved membrane fusion protein required for gamete fusion in diverse organisms  (Fedry, 407 
Liu et al. 2017) , and HOP1 , a component of synapto nemal complexes formed in the first 408 
meiotic division (Peacock, Ferris et al. 2011) . We did not , however , observe statistically  409 
significant changes in  other known marker genes of gametocytogenesis such as  SPO11 , 410 
DMC1  or MND1  (Peacock, Ferris et al. 2011) , likely due the sensitivity of the inDrop . Our 411 
analysis of the metabolic transcriptome remodeling indicate d that energy metabolism  in 412 
attached epimastigote  cells is dependent on the production of ATP in the mitochondrion , 413 
consistent with recent evidence from in vitro derived epimastigote  parasite s using the RBP6 414 
overexpression system (Dolezelova, Kunzova et al. 2020) . The most dramatic transcriptome 415 
remodeling was following asymmetrical  division of attached epimastigote, with  pre-metacyclic 416 
cells as transition intermediate s in terms of metabolic remodeling  (Figure 3) . These data are 417 
consistent with electron microscopy  evidence showing an increase in the number  and size  of 418 
glycosomes  together with the reduction of mitochondrial branc hing in metacyclic cells 419 
compared to attached epimastigote parasites (Tetley and Vickerman 1985, Kolev, Ramey - 420 
Butler et al. 2012) .  421 
 Our analysis of the establishment of monoallelic mVSG  expression has uncovered th at 422 
this is a phased process, first involving the activation of multiple mVSG -ES, and second the 423 
emergence of a single active mVSG -ES. Here , we present three independent lines of evidence 424 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted March 1, 2021. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.01.433049doi: bioRxiv preprint to support this finding. First, i n AnTat1.1E  (EATRO1125) parasites fr om tsetse salivary gland s, 425 
our inDrop data  identif ied both metacyclic and pre -metacyclic cells , which allowed us to 426 
evaluate the expression of mVSG  genes before monoallelic expression was established. 427 
Second, 10xGenomics data from Vigneron, O'Neill et al. (2020)  using the RUMP503 strain  428 
were re -analyzed . Vigneron, O'Neill et al. (2020)  concluded that each metacyclic cell 429 
expressed a single mVSG , as our re -analysis concluded.  However, expression of multiple 430 
mVSG  genes occurs before cells become metacyclic forms. The intermediate cell cluster 431 
identified in their study  therefore  likely represents the pre -metacyclic cells in our re -analysis. 432 
This analysis was only possible due to  the addition of de novo  assembled mVSG transcripts. 433 
Third, we used  smRNA -FISH in an in vitro  metacyclogenesis model using the Lister 427 strain . 434 
Taken together, our data from three strains  analyzed by  different techniques , strongly support 435 
our conclusions . This triple set of experimental evidence supports a dynamic  process where 436 
many genes are initially transcribed at a low level, and as expression levels increase, a single 437 
gene emerges as the active VSG.  438 
Metacyclic cells express a protein coat comprised o f a single VSG type (Ramey -Butler, 439 
Ullu et al. 2015) , suggesting that the multi -mVSG  gene expression we observed is restricted 440 
to the transcript level in pre-metacyclic cells. Indeed, immunogold electron microscopy (Tetley, 441 
Turner et al. 1987) and immunofluorescence data (Rotureau, Subota et al. 2012) indicates that 442 
pre-metacyclic cells do not have VSG  on their surface. According to the nomenclature from 443 
Tetley and Vickerman (1985), VSG protein appears on the surface of nascent metacyclic cells, 444 
a developmental stage between pre-metacyclic and metacyclic form cells. As no cell division 445 
occurs between pre-metacyclic/nascent/metacyclic differentiation, these data suggest that 446 
there is a temporal component to ensuring a single VSG coat which depends upon both the 447 
time required to establish a single active locus and the differentiation from pre-metacyclic to 448 
metacyclic cell.  No data is available on the duration of the transition from pre-metacyclic to 449 
metacyclic cell, so it is not possible to estimate the rate at which a single mVSG -ES is chosen 450 
in vivo. Evidence from VSG switching experiments in bloodstream forms indicates that new 451 
VSG  proteins are detectable on the surface within 12 h of a switch (Pinger, Chowdhury et al. 452 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted March 1, 2021. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.01.433049doi: bioRxiv preprint 2017) , suggesting that the establishment  of monoallelic expression could occur within this time 453 
frame . During the transition from BSF to PCF following a tsetse bloodmeal, the VSG coat is 454 
removed and rep laced with procyclin. The appearance of procyclin mRNA precedes  the 455 
appearance of protein by approximately 6h (Roditi, Schwarz et al. 1989) . If a similar delay 456 
exists with BARP to mVSG coat remodeling, this could p otentially explain how parasites are 457 
able to express a single VSG type in their mVSG coats. Nevertheless , the exact parameters 458 
underlying these transitions remain to be determined . 459 
In bloodstream form  cells, a single VSG  is transcribed from the active VSG -ES in the 460 
ESB (Navarro and Gull 2001) . In metacyclic cells , the picture is less clear : RNA Pol I staining 461 
indicated that no ESB is detected at this stage.  Metacyclic VSG -ES are much shorter than BSF 462 
VSG -ES (~5 Kbp for mVSG -ES compared to ~60 Kbp  for BSF VSG -ES), therefore the absence 463 
of an ESB in metacyclic  cells may be due to fewer  RNA Pol I  molecules  at these  loci (Ramey- 464 
Butler, Ullu et al. 2015) . Inferring  from the characteristics of the bloodstream ESB, we can 465 
speculate on nature of VSG  gene expression regulation in metacyclic cells. The ESB is a bi - 466 
partite  nuclear body consisting of the mRNA trans -splicing machiner y and the actively  467 
transcribed VSG -ES (Faria, Luzak et al. 2021) . VEX1 and VEX2 are markers of the ESB, and 468 
their association with the ESB are key to the maintenance of VSG monoallelic expression.  469 
Perturbation of e ither or both protein’s expression leads to dramatic failures in monoallelic VSG 470 
expression control, with silent VSG -ES being transcribed and multiple VSGs expressed on the 471 
surface (Glover, Hutchinson et al. 2016, F aria, Glover et al. 2019) . Pharmacological i nhibition 472 
of transcription disperse s the VEX1  and VEX2  and RNA Pol I  foci (Glover, Hutchinson et al. 473 
2016, Kerry, Pegg et al. 2017, Faria, Glover et al. 2019, Faria, Luza k et al. 2021) , suggesting 474 
that the ESB  requires active transcription. These data lead to a  picture of the ESB as a 475 
structure which emerges from, and is stabilized by transcription of a VSG  gene.  476 
We propose a model for the establishment of monoallelic ex pression  in metacyclic cells  477 
(Figure 7) where the  multi -mVSG  expression profiles observed in this study correlate to an 478 
initial step in a “race ” between each mVSG -ES (Figure 7A) to obtain a sufficient level of 479 
transcription (Figure 7B) which leads to  the down regulation  of other sites. We propose that 480 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

transcribing multiple mVSG -ES. This would likely in turn recruit VEX1 and VEX2 proteins to 482 
these loci, triggering a positive feedback loop, where VEX proteins recruit the mRNA splicing 483 
machinery, stabilize the ESB and drive further transcription. This could lead to suppression of 484 
transcription at other mVSG -ES by depletion of these limiting factors , or by the previously  485 
proposed “RNA silencing” , in which transcripts from the active VSG  silence transcription from 486 
other VSG -ES (Glover, Hutchinson et al. 2016) .  487 
We note a striking similarity between the dynamics controlling the establishment  of 488 
monoallelic expression in both mVSG  and olfactory neuron OR gene choice  (Hanchate, 489 
Kondoh et al. 2015) . In Metazoa , monoallelic expression underpins the expression of olfactory 490 
receptors ( ORs). It is initiated during neuronal development in the olfactory bulb, and 491 
establishment of monoallelic expression  is preceded by expression of multiple olfactory 492 
receptors in early mature olfactory neurons (Hanchate, Kondoh e t al. 2015) . A combination of 493 
DNA enhancer networks and an epigenetic trap , where the expression of an OR triggers a 494 
feedback loop which inhibits further activation after the first gene,  establish ing a single active 495 
OR. Here, during development of olfacto ry neurons, all OR genes are modified with 496 
heterochromatic histone trimethyl marks H3K4me3 and H4K20me3 (Magklara, Yen et al. 497 
2011) . The lysine demethylase LSD1 is then transiently expressed during development, 498 
activating a single OR (Lyons, Allen et al. 2013) . A feedback signal triggered by OR expression 499 
utilizing the misfolded protein response inhibits further OR gene activation (Dalton, Lyons et 500 
al. 2013) .  501 
Both systems have intermediate developmental stages where  transcripts from  multiple 502 
mVSG/OR  genes are detected, which then resolve to monoallelic states. Further, the 503 
establishment  of monoallelic expression of OR genes is dependent on the structured and 504 
temporal control of histone methylation  (Magklara, Yen et al. 2011) . Similarly, in trypanosomes, 505 
the histone methyltransferase DOT1B is required for strict control of mon oallelic expression 506 
following a transcriptional switch  (Figueiredo, Janzen et al. 2008) . In BSF cells, ectopic 507 
expression of a second VSG leads to silenci ng of the active VSG  that is dependent on DOT1B 508 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

In the race model, the mVSG -ES who lost the “race” for 509 
transcription would be silenced in a DOT1B dependent manner following the initial race, 510 
consistent with the two -stage process observed in BSF cells. These similarities suggest 511 
common solutions to the problem of monoallelic expression which deserve further 512 
investigation. Through both experimental data, and re -analyses of published data, we are able 513 
to uncover the dynamics underlying the establishment of monoallelic VSG expression. Our 514 
data provide a landscape to frame these future investigation s into the establishment of single 515 
antigen expression in trypanosomes.   516 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Tsetse fly infections and dissections  519 
 Tsetse flies ( Glossina morsitans morsitans ) were maintained at 27°C and 70% 520 
hygrometry in Roubaud cages, in groups of 50 male flies per cage. Teneral flies were infected 521 
with Trypanosoma brucei  Antat1.1 E (EATRO1125)  during their first meal. Stumpy form 522 
trypanosomes were resuspended at 106 cells per ml in SDM -79 (Brun and Schonenberger 523 
1979)  supplemented with 10% FBS (dominique Dutscher ) and 60  mM N -acetylglucosamine 524 
(Peacock et  al., 2006). Flies were allowed to feed on infected media through a silicone 525 
membrane. Following infection, flies were then maintained until dissection by feeding  four 526 
times per week  on sheep’s blood in heparin.  Flies were dis sected as described previously 527 
(Rotureau, Subota et al. 2012) . All salivary glands were collected (uninfected and infected) in 528 
trypanosome dilution  buffer on ice and midguts scored for the presence of trypanosomes. 529 
Salivary glands were manually broken using tweezers before being passed through a 70 µm 530 
cell strainer  (ClearLine)  to remove the salivary glands. Trypanosomes were counted on a 531 
hemocytomete r and diluted to 9.4 x 104 cells per ml . The final concentration was reached by 532 
adding 18 µL of  OptiPrep™ Density Gradient Medium  to 100 µL of cell suspension (final 533 
concentration 15 % vol/vol)  immediately prior to encapsulation.  Cells were maintained on i ce 534 
throughout this process.  535 
 536 
Microscopy  537 
 Live trypanosomes in SDM -79 (Brun and Schonenberger 1979)  were spread on glass 538 
slides and imaged on a DMR microscope (Leica) equipped with a EMCCD camera (C -9100, 539 
Hamamatsu). The camera was controlled using µManager and a plug in for Hamamatsu 540 
cameras (Edelstein, Tsuchida et al. 2014)  and captured images were edited using Fiji is just 541 
ImageJ (FIJI) (Schindelin, Arganda -Carreras et al. 2012) . For the viability assay, cells were 542 
scored for motility in a hemocytometer using an inverted phase contrast microscope.  543

  InDrop emulsions were prepared as described in Zilionis, Nainys et al. (2017) . A 546 
detailed protocol  compatible with the micr ofluidic designs described by Zilionis, Nainys et al. 547 
(2017)  is available on ( 10.5281/zenodo.3974628 ). Monodisperse droplets were produced by 548 
injecting the 3 aqueous phases consisting of the cells mix, RT and lysis mix and barcoded 549 
beads mix, and a  fluorinated  oil phase  containing fluorosurfactant  into a microfluidic chip with 550 
controlled flow rates, creating an emulsion . Polydimethylsiloxane  (PDMS) chips were 551 
fabricated as previously described (Mazutis, Gilbert et al. 2013)  at the Institut Pierre -Gilles de 552 
Gennes (IPGG) in Paris. After plasma bonding, chips were made hydrophobic by manual 553 
injection of 2  % 1H,1H,2H,2H -perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane  (Sigma -Aldrich) diluted in HFE 554 
7500 (3M Novec).   555 
Three aqueous phases, respectively for the cells, reverse transcriptase/lysis and BHMs 556 
(1CellB io) were prepared as follows ; the cell mix contain ed 100 µL of cells diluted at a 557 
concentration of 9.4 x 104 cells per ml  in trypanosome dilution buffer (TDB) (5 mM KCl, 80 mM 558 
NaCl, 1 mM MgSO 4, 20 mM Na 2HPO 4, 2 mM NaH 2PO 4, 20 mM glucose, pH 7.4)  supplement ed 559 
with 18 µL Optiprep (1CellBio) . The RT mix contains 1.3 RT premix (1CellBio), 11 mM MgCl 2 560 
(1CellBio), 6.9 mM DTT (Invitrogen), 1.13 U/µL SUPERase IN RNAse Inhibitor (Life 561 
Technologies), 20.7 U/µL Superscript III ( SSIII ) (Invitrogen) and 1 µM DY -647 (Dyo mics), the 562 
beads mix contains BHMs (1CellBio) packed in 1x Gel Concentration Buffer (1CellBio).  The 563 
commercial BHMs  carry photocleavable barcoded primers, containing, in order, a T7 promoter 564 
sequence  for IVT , an Illumina adaptor, a cellular barcode, a 6 nt  UMI and a 18TVN primer site, 565 
as described (Zilionis, Nainys et al. 2017) . The closely packing of the BHBs allows 80-90% 566 
loading of a single bead per droplet (Abate, Chen et al. 2009) . 567 
The 1 ml s yringes (Omnifix) for the cells, reverse transcriptase/lysis and BHMs  were 568 
loaded with mineral oil (Sigma -Aldrich) and connected to a 200 µL pipette tip  prefilled with 569 
mineral oil  using ~30 cm  of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE ) 0.56 mm  tubing and a PDMS plug  570 
connecting the tubing to the tip. Mineral oil was then ejected from the syringe until it entirely 571 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

Each reagent was aspirated on 572 
ice into the 200 µL pipette tips filled with mineral oil, just before encapsulati on. Cells were 573 
maintained on ice throughout the procedure by placing the pipette tip holding the cells in ice. 574 
A short length  (15 cm)  of PFTE 0.56 mm  tubing then connected this tube to the microfluidic 575 
chip. The RT/lysis and BHB pipette tips were directly inserted into the PDMS chip, whereas 576 
the tubing carrying cells from the pipette on ice was inserted  into the PDMS chip . The syringe 577 
for the oil phase was filled with carrier oil ( HFE-7500 fluorinated oil (3M  Novec ) containing 2% 578 
w/w 008 -FluoroSurfactant (R AN Biotechnologies) ) and connected to the PDMS chip by PFTE 579 
0.56 mm tubing.  580 
Droplet production and beads loading were followed using an inverted microscope 581 
(Nikon Eclipse Ti) and High -Speed Camera (Phantom). Flow rates for droplet production were 582 
controll ed with syringe pumps ( neMESYS 290N Low pressure Syringe Pump, Cetoni ). Droplets 583 
size and frequency of production were  monitored using laser optics excitation and detection 584 
and a soluble fluorophore DY -647 present in the droplets (Dyomics) as described  (Mazutis, 585 
Gilbert et al. 201 3). Flow rates of 250  µL/h, 250  µL/h, 60-80 µL/h  and 400 -500 µL/h  for the 586 
cells, RT/lysis and BHMs  and oil , respectively  were maintained . A 5 cm PTFE tubing (0.3 mm 587 
inner diameter) connects the chip outlet to a 1.5 mL collection tube, prefilled with 300 µ L of 588 
mineral oil . Emulsions were collected during 15 minutes on ice, corresponding to 589 
approximately 4,000 drops containing both a cell and an d a BHM . 590 
Generation  and sequencing of barcoded cDNA libraries  591 
We made two minor alterations to the molecular biolog y workflow described by Zilionis, 592 
Nainys et al. (2017) : Our protocol omits the RNA fragmentation step following IVT of double 593 
stranded cDNA products, and we modified the primer used to reverse transcribe amplified RNA 594 
(aRNA) to make our libraries compatible with  standard Illumina sequencing primers. These 595 
alterations are unlikely to affect the overall performance of inDrop, however.  596 
1. Recovery of first strand cDNA  597 
Barcoded cDNA l ibraries were prepared according to the protocol by Zilionis, Nainys et al. 598 
(2017)  with sm all exceptions. Following encapsulation and ultra violet primer release, 599 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted March 1, 2021. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.01.433049doi: bioRxiv preprint emulsions were incubated at 50°C for 2h and then 70°C for 15 minutes. Following reverse 600 
transcription (RT), emulsions were partitioned into approximately 2,000 cells per partition 601 
before breaking the emulsion by adding one drop (3µL) of 1H,1H,2H,2H -Perfluorooctanol  602 
(Sigma -Aldrich)  (Zilionis, Nainys et al. 2017) . cDNA was then stored at -80°C until further 603 
process ed. 604 
 Post-RT material was thawed on ice and 20µL of dH 2O (nuclease free) was added and 605 
the solu tion centrifuged at 16,000 g for 5 minutes at 4°C. The aqueous phase was then applied 606 
to a 0.45 µm filter spin column (Corning CoStar Spin -X, Sigma -Aldrich ) to remove the BHMs . 607 
The emulsion tube was then washed with 20µL dH 2O to collect as much cDNA as pos sible 608 
and applied to the spin column. The column was centrifuged at 16,000 g for 5 minutes at 4°C. 609 
The emulsion tube was washed once more and supernatant collected by centrifugation once 610 
more.  611 
2. Removal  of unused primers  612 
 The volume of cDNA was estimated  and digested by adding 100 µL of digestion mix 613 
(79 µL H2O, 9 µL 10x Fast Digest Buffer  (Thermo Scientific ), 5 µL ExoI (20 U/µL , NEB ), 7 µL 614 
HinFI ( 10U/µL, Thermo Scientific )) per 70 µL of cDNA and digested at 37°C for 30 minutes. 615 
Samples were then purified  by adding 1.2x volume of room temperature AMPure XP beads  616 
(Beckman Coulter ), incubating 5 minutes  at room temperature, collecting the beads on a 617 
magnet and then 3 washes with freshly prepared 80% ethanol (roo m temperature), followed 618 
by air drying , accordi ng to the manufacturer’s instructions . cDNA was then eluted in 17 µL of 619 
dH2O. 620 
3. Second strand synthesis  621 
 Second strand synthesis (SSS) was performed using the NEBNext Ultra II Non - 622 
Directional RNA Second Strand Synthesis Module  (E6111S ). 2 µL of SSS buffer  and 1 µL of 623 
SSS enzyme mix was added to 17 µL of cDNA and the reaction was incubated at 16°C for 624 
2h30m in a PCR machine with the lid set to 16°C. cDNA was purified again using 1.2x AMPure  625 
XP beads (as above) and eluted in 7µL of DNA elution buffer (Zilionis, Nainys et al. 2017 ). 626

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted March 1, 2021. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.01.433049doi: bioRxiv preprint  Double stranded cDNA was then amplified using the HiScribe T7 Quick High Yield RNA 628 
Synthesis Kit  (E20 50S). To the 8µL of double stranded cDNA, 10 µL of 10x NTPs buffer  mix, 629 
2 µL of T7 enzyme  and 1  µL of SUPERase IN RNAse Inibitor (20  U/µL) . were added and the 630 
reaction incubated at 37°C  with the lid set to 50°C  for 14 -16 hours. The size and concentration 631 
of amplified RNA was verified using a BioAnalyzer RNA pico chip (Agilent) using the mRNA 632 
pico program. Approximately 5 ng of aRNA was then reverse transcribed by adding 1  µL of 10  633 
mM dNTPs, 2  µL of Rd2N6  (see primer list)  and dH 2O to 13  µL. The RT reaction was heated 634 
to 70°C for 3 minutes and then put on ice for 1 minute. Finally , 4 µL of 5x  first strand  buffer, 1  635 
µL of 0.1M DTT, 1  µL of SSIII (200  U/µL) and 1  µL of SUPERase IN  RNase inhibitor  (20U/µL) . 636 
RT reactions were incubated for  5 minutes at 25 °C, followed by  1h at 50°C and heat inactivated 637 
at 70°C for 15 minutes. cDNA was p urified by adding 20  µL of dH 2O then purified with 1.2  x 638 
AMPure XP beads and eluted with 20  µL dH 2O. 10  µL of this was then stored at -80°C as a 639 
pre-PCR backup.  640 
5. Library PCR.  641 
The remaining 10  µL of cDNA was used for the library PCR. Libraries were PCR a mplified 642 
using KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Kapa Biosystem, KK2601 ). 25 µL of PCR mix containing  643 
12,5 µL of 2x  KAPA  HiFi Master mix,  10 µL of cDNA, together with 2.5 µL of 5 µM P5-Rd1 and 644 
P7-Rd2 primers (final concentration of 500 nM). Library indices were  in the P7 -Rd2 primer . 645 
Primer sequences are available in Supplementary table 4. The l ibraries were amplified using 646 
the following protocol; initial denaturation 5 min at 95°C, then 2 cycles of denaturation 98°C / 647 
20 s, annealing 55°C / 30s and extension 72° C / 40 s, followed by 10 cycles of denaturation 648 
98°C / 20 s, annealing 65°C / 30 s and extension 72°C / 40 s and final extension 5 min at 72°C. 649 
They were then size selected using 0.7x volume  of AMPure XP beads at room temperature 650 
prior to quantification an d sequencing.  651 
6. Library quantification and sequencing  652 
 Libraries were quantified using the KAPA library quantification kit for Illumina  (Kapa 653 
Biosystem, KK4824 ) according to the manufacturers’ protocol. Bulk libraries (Figure 1B) were 654 
sequenced on the Ill umina MiSeq platform  with a MiSeq V3 150 cycle cartridge  at the Institut 655 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

Single cell barcoding libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq platform at the 656 
Institut Pasteur  using a Mid -output 150 cycle cartridge. Sequencing of single cell librar ies at 657 
BGI was performed on the  MGIseq -2000  following conversion to DNBseq libraries (Senabouth, 658 
Andersen et al. 2020) . Details of sequencing outputs including read lengths and number of 659 
reads generated can be found in Supplementary table 5.  660 
 661 
Trypanosoma brucei transcriptom e 662 
We assembled a non -redundant transcriptome from the T . brucei TREU927 reference 663 
strain  (Berriman, Ghedin et al. 2005) . As only 60% of the trypanosome transcriptome has 664 
annotated 3´ UTRs, we decided to extend each  gene’s annotated 3´ extremity to the 5´ 665 
extremity of the neighboring gene. This was done by a combination of scripted extension using 666 
the following rules. 1. If the proceeding gene is on the same strand, and within 2.5 kbp, the 667 
gene is extended to the bas e before the proceeding gene. 2. If the proceeding gene is over 668 
2.5 kbp then the gene is extended to 2.5 kbp downstream. 3. If the gene already extended into 669 
the proceeding gene, then no change was made. 4. Similarly if the proceeding gene is on the 670 
opposi te strand, no extension was made. Following extension of the entire gene list, extended 671 
transcripts were filtered using a non -redundant gene list (Alsford, Turner et al. 2011) .  672 
 To obtain sequences of metacyclic VSG  genes expressed in the salivary glands, we 673 
aligned our data to the VSGnome (inclu ding flanks) of the Antat1.1 E (EATRO1125) strain 674 
made available by Cross (2017)  here (http://129.85.245.250/index.html), using bowtie2 675 
(Langmead and Salzberg 2012)  and selecte d the top 8 gene most abundant transcripts. These 676 
are Tbb1125VSG -1401  (Genbank: KX699657 ), Tbb1125VSG -1476  (Genbank: KX699716 ), 677 
Tbb1125VSG -1654  (Genbank: KX699860 ), Tbb1125VSG -385 (Genbank: KX699226 ), 678 
Tbb1125VSG -393 (Genbank: KX698711 ), Tbb1125VSG -4564  (Genbank: KX700928 ), 679 
Tbb1125VSG -4862  (Genbank: KX701110 ), Tbb1125VSG -4959  (Genbank: KX701187 ).  680 
 To this non -redundant transcriptome, we appended both a human transcriptome and 681 
the G. morsitans morsitans  genome sequence  (International Glossina Genome 2014) . Our 682 
inDrop library preparations included 5% human B -cells as a positive control for the inDrop 683 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted March 1, 2021. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.01.433049doi: bioRxiv preprint pipeline , and our bowtie2 index therefore contained the ENSEMBL release 85 human 684 
transcriptome (Yates, Achuthan et al. 2020) . The alignment index was constructed with 685 
bowtie2 -build  (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) . These files are available at 686 
10.5281/zenodo.3974628 . 687 
 688 
Generation and analysis of  bulk inDrop data  689 
 Cultured procyclic form Antat1.1E (EATRO1125) trypanosomes w ere encapsulated 690 
using a standard inDrop microfluidic chip, except we replaced BHMs  with a single primer , 691 
T7Rd2_linkerPolyTvN  (Supplementary table 4). Libraries were generated as described by 692 
Zilionis, Nainys et al. (2017) , and as described for single cell BHMs  in this manuscript, except 693 
we excluded stages relating to filtration of BHMs . Libraries were sequenced on a MiSeq at the 694 
Institut Curie (Paris) next generation sequencing platform.  695 
Bulk data were aligned to the trypanosome genome sequence using bowtie2 696 
(Langmead and Salzberg 2012) , and resu lting bam files manipulated using samtools (Li, 697 
Handsaker et al. 2009) . Metagene plots and heat maps were generated using deeptools2 698 
(Ramirez, Ryan et al. 2016) . Gene coordinates used in the metaplot were the 5´and 3´splicing 699 
and polyaden ylation signal sites (or start and stop codons if unannotated for a particular gene). 700 
Bin size was set to 10 bp and the 500 bp region downstream from each gene are unscaled. 701 
The gene list was filtered to a non -redundant set (Alsford, Turner et al. 2011) . 702 
 703 
inDrop pre -processing pipeline  704 
To permit m ore usability with bespoke genome sequences (no reference sequence is 705 
available for the strain used  here for tsetse infections), w e generated a new  inDrop data 706 
analysis pipeline for the analysis of trypanosomes, using bowtie2 and UMI-tools  (Langmead 707 
and Salzberg 2012, Smith, Heger et al. 2017) , rather than bowtie and the inDrop analysis 708 
pipeline (Klein, Mazutis et al. 2015) . Pre-processing of inDrop data was performed using the 709 
UMI-tools package  (Smith, Heger et al. 2017) . A bash script is available at 710 
(10.5281/zenodo.3974628 ) which performs all steps of the pre -processing. The script 711 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted March 1, 2021. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.01.433049doi: bioRxiv preprint exec utes 5 steps: 1. whitelist, 2. fastqsplitter, 3. extract, 4. align and 5. count. Whitelist 712 
generates a list of acceptable barcodes , using a regular expression to pattern match the cell 713 
barcode flanked by the common “W1” sequence (Klein, Mazutis et al. 2015, Zilionis, Nainys et 714 
al. 2017)  permitting upto 6 errors in the W1, and requiring a string of 3 “T” nucleotides after the 715 
UMI. We set the error correction threshold for barcodes at 2, and set the expected number of  716 
cells at 2,000. We subset 106 reads to perform the whitelist step (these same filtering 717 
parameters are maintained through our workflow).  Fastqsplitter breaks the read files into a 718 
user-defined number of equal parts to allow downstream parallel processing.  Extract then 719 
places the whitelisted cell barcodes from read 1 into the header of mRNA sequences in read 720 
2, using the regex pattern matching parameters from whitelist . The script can initiate multiple 721 
instances of extract to reduce the time required for th is stage. Align uses bowtie2 (Langmea d 722 
and Salzberg 2012)  to align the reads to the hybrid trypanosome, human transcriptomes and 723 
tsetse fly genome. Reads aligning to the tsetse genome were filtered out using samtools view 724 
(Li, Handsaker et al. 2009) .  Finally count generates count matrices at mapping quality 0 and 725 
40. Higher mapping stringency was used for VSG  counts to ensure accurate mapping.  726 
 727 
Analysis of single cell RNA -seq data  728 
 Single cell count matrices were analysed using the Seurat R package (Butler, Hoffman 729 
et al. 2 018, Stuart, Butler et al. 2019) . Data were normalized using the single cell transform 730 
algorithm (Hafemeister and Satija 2019) . Complete R scripts are available in 731 
(10.5281/zenodo.3974628 ) to generate  all the figures  in the manuscript. Count t ables from 732 
mapq 0 and mapq 40 matrices were merged into a single matrix by removing VSG counts with 733 
mapq 0 and merging the mapq 40 counts to this reduced matrix. Valid b arcodes were filtered 734 
by a minimum gene cut-off of 300. VSG UMI count data were extract ed using fetchData, 735 
accessing the “counts” slot of the RNA assay.  736 
To assess the sequencing depth, we employed data s ubsetting , as done previously by 737 
Zhang, Li et al. (2019) . Data sets were subset using samtools and UMI totals per barcode 738 
extracted in R , retaining only valid barcodes (R script on 10.5281/zenodo.3974628 ). To 739 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

number of aligned reads per barcode (available on 10.5281/zenodo.3974628 ). Subset reads 741 
were then calculated as a fraction of the total. To calculate the Levenshtein distance between 742 
valid barcodes, the barcodes for replicate 1 were extracted and all possible pairs were 743 
evaluated using a python script ( 10.528 1/zenodo.3974628 ). Histogram and plotting were 744 
performed in R. To estimate the expected rate of doublets a Poisson series was generated 745

frequency of multi -VSG  expression observed in the pre -metacyclic cell cluster. The metabolism 747 
analysis was performed using metabolic funtion annotations and schematic for glycolysis and 748 
TCA cycle from trypanocyc (Shameer, Logan -Klumpler et al . 2015) . Scaled (Z -scores) are from 749

Single molecule RNA -FISH  752 
 Overexpression of RBP6 was performed using PT1RBP6 -OE cells (a kind gift provided by 753 
Lucy Glover, Institut Pasteur). PT1 cells  are equivalen t to the 2T1 BSF (Alsford, Kawahara et 754 
al. 2005) . Wild type Lister 427 PCF cells  were transfected with pHD1313  (Alibu, Storm et al. 755 
2005) . Second, a ribosomal spacer was targeted with pRPH, integrating a hygromycin 756 
resista nce cassette and eGFP reporter gene (GFP tagged Sir2.3) with a RNA Pol -I promoter 757 
under the control of a tet operator  (Alsford, Kawahara et al. 2005) . The RPH locus was  then 758 
disrupte d with pH3E  (Alsford, Kawahara et al. 2005) , replac ing hygromycin with a puromycin 759 
resistance cassette, resulting in PT1 cells.  Cells were induced by addition of 10 µg/ml of 760 
tetracyc line to the culture medium and diluting every 24h to 2 x 106 cells per ml. We made 761 
staggered inductions to obtain 3, 4 and 5 day induced cultures on the same day. We used the 762 
ViewRNA™ Cell Plus Assay Kit  (Catalog number 88-19000 -99, Thermo Fisher) for smRN A- 763 
FISH. The company designed probes based on the VSG -397 and VSG -531 or alpha tubulin 764 
coding sequences. We followed the manufacturer’s instructions with a few minor exceptions. 765 
Before settling cells onto slides, we chilled cultures on ice and then fixed in  ice cold 1 % 766 
paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were immediately washed in ice cold PBS by spinning 3x at 767 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

Cells were settled onto 8 -well glass chamber slides ( Nunc™ Lab -Tek™ 768 
II Chamber Slide™ System ) and stained according to the manufac turer’s protocol. A minimum 769 
of 100 µL was used to avoid drying samples during incubations. Cells were imaged on a  770 
widefield  Zeiss Axio Imager.Z2 upright microscope equipped with an LED light source , and an 771 
Axiocam 506 camera. Images were analysed using FIJ I (Schindelin, Arganda -Carreras et al. 772
