Abstract: The use of orange peel as  low-cost and eco -friendly adsorbents has been investigated as an ideal alternative 
to the current expensive methods of removing dyes from wastewater. This paper concern s with the removal of Blue 56 
from aqueous solutions by orange peel. The effects of pH  initial concentration,  adsorbent dosage , and particle  size of 
adsorbent , temperature and  also isotherm data analysis and adsorption  kinetics were  investigated . A maximum 
removal of 96.76% was obtained at pH 2.5 for an adsorbent dose of 0.2 mg . Rate of adsorpti on was found to conform 
to pseudo -second -order kinetics with a good correlation ( R2=0.99). The maximum  adsorption capacity obtained from 
Langmuir equation was  9.69 (mgg-1).

INTRODUCTION  
Dyes are used in order to color products  in many 
industries such as food , paper , carpet, rubber, plastics, 
cosmetics, and textile  (Robin son et al. 2002 ; 
Ramakrishna et al.  1997 ; Nigam  et al. 2000 ). The 
discharge of colored wastewater from these industries 
into natural streams has caused many significant 
problems, such as increasing the COD (chemical 
oxygen demand) of the effluent, and also  reducing the 
light penetration  which has a derogatory effect on 
photosynthetic   phenomenon. From the aesthetic  
point of view, the presence of dyes, in particular 
carcinogenic compounds, in surface and underground 
waters is not  safe, pleasant, or welcomed . So the 
removal of color from waste effluents is 
environmentally important  (Sanghi  et al.  2002 , Malik  
2003) The USEPA (Environmental Protection Agency) 
has classified textile wastes into four groups, 
dispersible, hard -to-treat, high -volume,  and hazardous 
and toxic wastes (Tsui et al.  2003) . Many 
physicochemical methods have been tested but only 
that of adsorption is considered to be superior to other  
 
 
 techniques. This contributed to low cost, easy 
availability, simplicity of design,  high efficiency,  ease 
of operation, biodegrad able  of natural adsorbents 
[Sanghi  et al.  2002 , Meshko  et al. 2001 , McKay  and 
Chem , 1982) many researchers have investigated low -
cost, biodegradable substitutes made from natural 
resources to remove organic contaminants such as 
dyes from wastewater.  Adsorbents used include 
agricultural solid wastes such as coir pith 
(Namasivayam and Kadirvelu  1994) , banana pith 
(Namasivayam  et al.  1997) , coconuthusk (Low 1990) , 
sawdust (Asfour  et al.  1985) , biogas residual 
slurry (Namasivayam and Ya muna 1994) , peatmoss 
and rice hulls (Nawar and Doma 1989) , bagasse and 
paddy straw (Deo and Ali  1993) , and industrial solid 
wastes such as fly ash and coal (Gupta et al.  1990) , 
red mud (Namasivayam.,1997)  and Fe/Cr (III) 
hydroxide Namasivayam et al. 1994) . In this study,  
orange peel was used as an adsorbent to remove blue 
56 from aqueous solution.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
Chemicals and materials  
Waste orange peel was obtained from a frui t stall,  and 
changed  into small pieces . The peels were first 
washed  to remove the adhering  dirt and then were 
dried, crushed, and sieved. They  were  dried at room 
temperature (25° C) for 36 h.  After drying sieved and 
powdered, t he powdered orange peel was sieved for 
particles of 40  60 and 100 mesh sizes and used as  an 
adsorbent.  The dye which was  used in this study was 
Blue56 .The dyes with Molecular 
nFormolaC 40H35N3O3S Molecular weight 637.7892  
[g/mol] , and max=603(nm)  were purchased from  
Isfahan loom  company . Chemical  structures of these 
dyes were  show ed in  Fig. 2. Other chemicals were 
Analar grade  from Merck. The pH of the solutions 
was adjusted by  adding proper amount s of 0.1 M HCL  
and 0.1 M NaOH.  UV–VIS spectrophotometer  model -
160A SHIMADZU  was used to measurement of 
absorption  aqueous solutions .

Adsorption procedure  
An aliquot of dye solution  was passed through a mini  
column containing  powd ered orange peel 
(mesh=100). The absorb ance of Blue  56 was 
measured  spectrophotometrical ly at max (603 nm)  
befor e and a fter passing of Blue 56 thro ugh the 
column . The used column  was a funn el with following 
dimension s; inside  diameter =7mm, height =5 -6cm.  
Finally , per cent removal of Blue  56 (R%) was 
calcul ated using the equation  (2.1)

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION S 
 
The effect of pH  
The effect of pH was studied by varying the  initial pH 
of dye solution and keeping the other process 
parameters as constant.  Experiments  were carried out 
at different pH (PH 2 -10) for different dye 
concentration (60 7080 mg/l) and constant orange 
peel dosage of 0.2  g.  The effect of pH on the 
adsorption of Blue 56 dye by  orange peel is shown in 
Fig. 3. The maximum dye adsorpti on obtained  96.76% 
at pH 2.5 orange  peel is composed of various 
functional groups, such as amino and carboxyl, which 
could also be affected by the pH of solutions. 
Therefore, the electrostatic attraction, as well as the 
organic properties and structure of dye molecules and 
orange peel, could play a very important role in dye 
adsorption on orange peel. Electrostatic  attraction 
exists between the positively charged surface of the 
adsorbent and the anionic dye.

The effect of initial concentration of dye 
The effect of dye concentration was studied by 
keeping the adsorbent dose constant at 0.2 g and the 
concentration  of dye was in the range of 30 -90 ppm. 
R% was decreased with increas ing  initial 
concentration of dye (Fig. 4) and this could  be due to 
lack of available  active sites required for hig h initial 
concentration of the  dye, as maximum dye  adsorption  
obtained  99.25% at 30mg/l  initial   concentration.  
 
Fig. 4: Effect of dye concentration  Dye concentration  (30-90) mg/l,  
pH=2.5 , mesh=100, adsorbent dosage=0.2g  
 
The effect of adsorbent dosage  
To investig ate the effect of adsorbent dosage, the 
adsorption of blue 56 onto orange peel was measured 
at three dye concentration s (60, 70, and 80 ) mg/l for 
different adsorbent dosage s (0.05 g-0.2g). When the 
adsorbent dos age was increased from 0.05 g to 0.2g, 
R% was increased from 53 to 98. I t is clear from Fig. 
5 that the increas ed R%  with increas ing adsorbent 
dose was due to the availa bility of larger surface area 
with more active adsorbent sites . 
 
 
 The effect of particle size  
Particle size  has an important  effect  on adsorption. 
The effect  of particle  size (mesh size) was studied 
with 40 60 and 100 mesh sizes at three dye 
concentr ations (60, 70, and 80 ) mg/l (Fig.  6). It was 
observed that the R% with smaller adsorbent size 
(mesh 100)  was higher than R% with bigger adsorbent 
size (mesh 40) due to availability of more adsorption 
sites.

The effect of temperature  
Temperature is a highly  significant  parameter in 
adsorption process . The effect of temperature was 
studied at three  concentr ations (60, 70, 80) mg/l  at 
pH=2.5  and mesh size =40.  The experiments  were 
carried out at four different temperatur es 15, 25, 35, 
and 45°C. From  the results in Fig.7 was understood 
that the removal of BLUE 56 was increased from 60% 
to 95.5% by orange peel with increas ing temperature 
from 15 to 45°C. The increase in up take of orange 
peel, with  temperature may be d ue to d issolve of the J. Chemical Health Risks 2(1): 7-14, 2012

 adsorbing species, the change in pore size and 
enhanced rate of intra - particle diffusion of adsorbate . 
Thus, the adsorption process  is an endothermic 
process.

Isotherm data analysis  
The relationship between the amount of a substance 
adsorbed at constant temperature and its concentration 
in the equilibrium solution is called the adsorption 
isotherm.  The adsorption  isotherm is important from 
both a theoretical and a practical point of view. In 
order to optimize the design  of an adsorption system 
to remove the dye, it is important to establis h the most 
appropriate correla tions of the equilibrium data of 
each system. Equilibrium isotherm equations are used 
to describe the experimental sorption data. The 
parameters obtained f rom the different models provide 
important information on the sorption mechanisms  
and the surface properties and af ﬁnities  of the sorbent. 
The most widely accepted surface adsorption models 
for single solute systems are the Langmuir and 
Freundlich models. The correlation with the amount 
of adsorption and the liquid -phase concentration was 
tested with the Langmuir, Freundlich, Tempkin and 
Dubinin –Radushkevich (D –R) isotherm equations . 
The Linear  regression is freque ntly used to determine 
the best isotherm, a nd the applicability of isotherm 
equations is compared by judging the correlation 
coefficients . Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm 
equations were tested in this work . 
 Langmuir isotherm  
 
The theoretical Langmuir isotherm (Langmuir , 1916)  
is valid for sorptio n of a solute from a liquid solution 
as monolayer adsorption on a surface  containi ng a 
finite number of identical sites. Langmuir isotherm  
model assumes uniform energies of adsorption on  to 
the surface  without transmigration of adsorbate in the 
plane of th e surface (Dogan  et al.  2000) .There fore, the 
Langmuir isotherm mode l was chosen for estimation  
of the maximum adsorption capacity corresponding to 
complete  monolayer coverage on the sorbent surface. 
The Langmuir non -linear equation is commonly 
expressed as  followed:  
 
Ce/qe= 1/ (Kq m) + Ce/qm                               3.1 
 
In Eq . (3.1),  qe is the amount of dye adsorbed on the 
orange peel at equilibrium, Ce is the equilibrium 
concentration of dye solution , q m is the maximum 
adsorption capacity and  K is adsor ption equilibrium  
constant ( l/mg) that is related to the apparent  energy 
of sorption.  (Kinniburgh . 1986 , Longhinott  et al.  
1998) The equilibrium isotherm for the adsorption of 
dye BLUE 56 on  orange peel was determined with 0.2 
gr orange peel and 25  ml of dy e solution (50 -90 mg/ 
l), (200 rpm) in a constant temperature at pH 2.5. Fig. 
8 shows  the langmuir  isotherm of  dye BLUE 56  using 
orange peel  (qe versus Ce ). A plot of Ce/qe versus Ce 
should indicate a straight line of slope 1/ qm and an 
intercept of 1/(Kqm). The values of q m and k were 
determined slop and intercepts of the plots qm, K, r2 
(correlation coefficient for Langmuirisotherm), are 
given in Table 2.

2.303The Freundlich isotherm  
The Freundlich isotherm  model (Freundlich , 1906 ) is 
the earliest known equation describing the adsorption 
process. It is an empirical equation can be used for 
non-ideal sorption that involves he terogeneous 
sorption. The Freundlich isotherm can be derived 
assuming a log -       arithmic  decrease in the enthalpy  
of sorption with the increase in the fraction of 
occupied sites and is commonly given by the 
following  
log q e = log K F + (1/n) log C e  3.2           
Where Kf is a constant for the system  related to the 
bonding energy.  Kf can be de ﬁned as the adsorption or 
distribution coefficient  and represents the quantity of 
dye adsorbed onto adsorbent for unit equilibrium 
concentration. 1/ n is indicating the adsorption 
intensity of dye on to the sorbent or surface 
heterogeneity, becoming more heterogeneous as its 
value gets closer to zero. A value for 1/ n below 1 
indicates a normal Langmuir isotherm while 1/ n 
above 1  is indicative of cooperative adsorption .

The applicability of the Freundlich sorption isotherm 
was al so analyzed  using the same set of experimental 
data, by plotting log( qe) versus log( C).The data 
obtained from linear Freundlich isotherm  plot for the 
adsorption of the B56on to orange peel are presented 
in Table 2.

Adsorption kinetics  
Severa l steps can be used to examine the controlling 
mechanism of sorption process such as chemical 
reaction, diffusion control and mas s transfer; kinetic 
models are used to test experimental data from the 
adsorption of B56 on  to orange peel. The kinetics of 
B56 adsorption onto orange peel is required for 
selecting optimum operating conditions for the full -
scale ba tch process. The kinetic  parame ters, which are 
helpful for the prediction of adsorption rate, give 
important information for de signing and modeling the 
adsorp tion processes. Thus, the kinetics of B56 
adsorption onto orange peel were analyzed using 
pseudo -ﬁrst-order ] (Lagergren, 1898) , pseudo -second -
order (Ho et al.  2000) kinetic models.  The conformity 
between experimental data and the model predicted 
values was  expressed by the correlation coefficients  
(R2, values close or equal to 1). The relatively higher 
value is the more applicable model to the kinetics of 
B56 adsorption onto orange peel . 
 
Pseudo -ﬁrst-order equation  
The adsorption kinetic data were described  by the 
Lager - gren pseudo -ﬁrst-order model (Lagergren , 
1898),  which is the earliest known equation describing 
the adsorption rate based on the adsorption capacity. 
The differential equation is generally expresse d a 
follows:  
 
3.3         
Where qe and qt are the adsorption capacities  at         
equilibrium and at time t, respectively  (mgg-1), k 1 is J. Chemical Health Risks 2(1): 7-14, 2012

t 2 e tt 1 1= + tq k q qthe rate constant of Pseudo -ﬁrst-orde adsorption  
(Lmin-1). In order to obtain the rate constants,  the 
values of log ( qe- qt) were linearly  correlated by plot 
of log ( q- qt) versus (t) to give a  linear  relationship  
from  which  k1 and predicted (q) can be determined 
from the slope and intercept of the plot, respectively 
(Fig.10). The variation in rate should be proportional 
to the first  power  of concentration for str ict surface 
adsorption. However,  the relationship between initial 
solut e concentration and rate of adsorption  will not be 
linear when pore diffusion limits the adsorption 
process.  Thus,  the model represents the initial stages 
where rapid adsorption occurs well but cannot be 
applied for the entire adsorption process.  Furthermore,  
the experimental q e values do not agree with  the 
calculated  ones,  obtained  from  the linear  plots  and the 
correlation coefficient  R2 are relatively low for most 
adsorption data  (Tabl e 3). This shows that the 
adsorption of B56  on to orange peel cannot  be applied 
and the reaction mechanism is not a  first-order 
reaction.

Pseudo -second -order  equation  
The adsorption kinetic may be described by the 
pseudo -second - order model (Ho et al.  2000) . The 
differential  equation is generally given as  follows:  
 
3.4            
Where, K2 (g (mg min -1)) is the second -order rate  
constant of  adsorption . If the second -order kinetics is 
applicable,  then the  plot of (t/q) versus (t) should 
show a  linear relation ship.  Values of (k 2) and 
equilibrium adsorption capacity (q)  were calculated 
from the intercept and slope of the plots of ( t/q) 
versus( t) (Fig. 11) The correlation coefficients for the 
second -order kinet ic model are greater than 0.993 , 
which led to believ e that the pseudo -second -order 
kinetic model provided good correlation for the 
biosorption of different initial of B56 on to orange 
peel.
