Abstract  
 
This study presents the isolation of  marine bacteria, from Abo Ramad, Sharm El 
Madfaa and  shalateen, Red Sea , Egypt , capable to degrading an azo dye  Direct Red 
31 (DR 31). The  16S rDNA sequence and phenotypic characteristics indicated an 
isolated organism as Pseudoalteromonas sp p34  (EU864258) . This strain exhibited 
complete Direct Red 31 (DR 31) (100mg/L) decolorization after 16 hours, where the 
maximum decolorizion was at 800  mg/L of dye after 40 hours with 62% 
decolorization under static condition. For color removal, the optimum temperature 
was from 25 to 40∘C, where the optimum pH ranged from   6.0 to 9.0. Moreover, the 
present work indicates the cabability of strain Pseudoa lteromonas sp p34 to 
decolorize another four different azo dyes.  Biodegradation of the azo dyes was 
confirmed by using UV -Vis spectral analysis

Introduction  
Azo dyes are one of a variety of artificial organic compounds that represent the 
majority of textile dyes produced and widely used in industries in cluding paper, food, 
cosmetics, leather, pharmaceutical and dyeing industries [1]. The first commercially 
successful synthetic dye  was disc overed for practical uses in 1856.There are huge UBLICATIONS (MECSJ) CATION AND SCIENCE P SIVE JOURNAL FOR EDU ELECTRONIC COMPREHEN NOWLEDGE  K- MULTI

numbers of different dyes with an annual output of 7 × 105 metric tons worldwide 
available commercially[2 -3]. The loss of dye depends on the class of the dye 
application,  ranging from 2% while  the loss of ba sic dyes to fifty percent in some 
activated sulfonic dyes, leading to severe pollution in aquatic environments near the 
dyeing industries [4 -5]. The improper disposal of liquid textile dyes in aquatic 
ecosystems reduces the penetration of sunlight, which i n turn reduces the 
concentration of dissolved oxygen , water quality, and photosynthetic activity resulting 
in toxic effects on marine plants and animals, causing serious environmental problems 
worldwide [6]. In addition, many azo dyes have a severe adverse  effect in terms of 
biological and chemical oxygen and organic carbon [7].It can also cause serious 
illness in human health such as a damage of liver, the reproductive system, kidney, 
brain, and nervous system, nausea, and hemorrhage and mucous membranes [ 8]. A lot 
of artificial azo dyes besides their metabolites are carcinogenic, toxic, and mutagenic 
[9]. Therefore, it is essential to treat industrial sewages having azo dyes and their 
metabolites before their final liberation into the environment.  
 
Due to the low efficiency, high cost, limited versatility, the handling of the waste 
generated and the interaction of other wastewater components, the major drawbacks 
of these procedures have been largely studied [10]. On the contrary, biological 
processes are mo re operative than technologies as they are more cost -effective, 
environmental friendly and do not produce large amounts of sludge. Reduction, 
oxidation, photolysis, chemical precipitation, flocculation, adsorption and 
electrochemical treatment are physicoc hemical methods that are used for the 
elimination of azo dyes [11]. Many microorganisms belongingsuch as bacteria, algae, 
actinomycetes and fungi have been reported for their ability to decolorize azo 
dyes[12].Many studies reported that bacteria have the a bility of dye decolorization 
whichever individually or in consortia [13 –16]. In contrast, fungi have been used to 
advance the biological processes for azo dyes, but the decolorization with moderate 
rate limits the activity of their decolorization process [ 17].

The present work aimed to isolate a bacterial strain with a significant capability to 
degrade Direct Red 31(DR 31) as a carbon source.  In addition, various 
physiochemical experiments have been done to increase the efficiency of dye 
removal.  Degradation of the dye was confirmed through UV -Vis spectral analysis 
before and after decolorization.  
 
Materials and Methods  
 
Culture Medium and dyes  
 
The mineral salts medium (MSM) was prepared [18]. The MSM consisted of the 
following constituents (g/L):  2KH 2PO 4 (2.0), Na 2HPO 4 ⋅2H2O (1.0), NH 4NO 3 (0.50), 
Ca (NO 3) 2⋅4H2O (0.050), MgC l2⋅6H2O (0.10), and FeC l2⋅4H2O (0.0075) with 10mL 
of the element solution per liter. For the element solution (mg/L), a mixture of: 
NiC l2⋅6H2O (2.0), ZnSO 4⋅7H2O (10.0), MnC l2⋅4H2O (3.0), CoC l2⋅6H2O (1.0), 
CuC l2⋅2H2O (1.0),  H3BO 3 (30.0), and Na 2MoO 4⋅2H2O (3.0), were prepared. Further, 
MSM was  blended with Direct Red 31(DR 31) with different concentrations. The pH 
was adjusted to 7.0 ± 0.2. The MSM with agar (1.9% w/v) was used f or isolation of 
pure culture. The media were sterilized at 121 ∘C for 20min before use. five textile 
dyes; Direct Red 31(DR31) , Direct Blue 90, Direct Brown 115 , Direct Green 26 and 
Direct Orange 39, were purchased from the textile industry. They are widely used in 
textile industries. Direct Red 31(DR 31) was used as a model azo dye in this study 
(Fig. 1).  
 
Isolation of Dye Decol orizing Bacteria   
Water samples were collected from 5 coastal sites of Abo Ramad, 11 coastal sites of 
Sharm El Madfaa and 12 coastal sites of shalateen, Red Sea, Egypt, and were brought 
to the laboratory. 10mL of water sample was added to 100mL of MSM brot h 
containing Direct Red 31(DR 31) (100mg/L) and incubated at 300C for 2 weeks under 
static as well as shaking conditions. Then 10mL the decolorized culture flask was 
added to 100mL of MSM broth containing (DR 31) and incubated for 7 days under UBLICATIONS (MECSJ) CATION AND SCIENCE P SIVE JOURNAL FOR EDU ELECTRONIC COMPREHEN NOWLEDGE  K- MULTI

static condi tion. 0.5mL of decolorized culture spread over the MSM agar plates 
containing (DR 31) and incubated at 30∘C for 2 days. The obtained colonies formed 
were purified by streaking on agar medium. Each purified culture was tested for the 
ability of degrading dy e. One hundred and thirty five isolates were obtained. The 
potential isolate was selected and characterized by using the biochemical and 
morphological properties [19].  
 
Identification of Dye Decolorizing Bacteria based on16S rDNA Sequencing  
 
Genomic DNAs of the selected isolate was extracted with the genomic DNA 
extraction protocol of Gene Jet genomic DNA purification Kit. The PCR 
thermocycler was set as follow: 95°C for 5 min for initial denaturation, 30 cycles at 
95°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min, 72°C for 2 min and a finally at 72°C for 10 min. The 
product from PCR was made by Sigma Scientific Services Company, Egypt. Various 
alignments of the resulted sequences of the closely members were done by using 
BioEdit (software version 7 (. Sequences of rRNA genes were done by (NCBI) 
database [20].  
 
Decolorization Experiment  
  
100mL of sterilized MSM broth supplemented with Direct Red 31 (DR31) (100mg/L) 
and yeast extract (0.1% w/v). Yeast extract was added to increase the dye 
decolorization efficiency. They were in oculated with 5mL of cultures broth. The 
flasks were incubated at 30∘C under static as well as shaking of 120 rpm, conditions. 
The supernatant was collected by centrifuging at 10,000 rpm for 15min. 
Decolorization and bacterial growth were estimated spectro photometrically then the 
percentage was calculated [21].  Decolorization of dye was monitored using UV -Vis 
spectrophotometer.

Optimization of Physicochemical Parameters   
 
The decolorization efficiency of Pseudoalteromonas sp p34 on Direct Red 31(DR 31) 
was studied at different temperatures values (20,25,30,35,4 0,45,50∘C) and pH 
(4,5,6,7,8,9,10). The obtained optimum temperature at 30∘C and pH7.0 were for the 
decolorization activity under physicochemical factors such as salt concentration (1 –
6%), yeast extract concentration (0.1 –2.0 g/L) and dye concentration (10 0–800mg/L). 
The decolorization of azo dye was carried out by incubating MSM containing Direct 
Red 31 (DR31) dye with bacterial strain Pseudoalteromonas sp  p34. 
 
Results and Discussion  
 
Isolation, Screening of bacterial strains  
One hundred and thirty five isolates were isolated.  The potential bacterial strain 
Pseudoalteromonas sp p34 showed a positive decolorization of Direct Red 31(DR 31) 
within 16 h under static condition. Its colony was white to light yellow, round, and 
slick . The potential strain was identified as Pseudoalteromonas sp p34 on the basis of 
the biochemical characteristics and16S rDNA gene sequence. It was close to the 
member of Pseudoalteromonas sp p34.group  [22] submitted to Genbank with 
accession number of EU864258 . Some reports studied the degradation of polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons by Pseudoalteromonas sp p34 [23-24]. 
 
Effect of Shaking and Static Conditions  
The decolorization efficiency of Pseudoalteromonas sp p34 on Direct Red 31(DR 31) 
showed 100% deco lorization under static condition when compared to only 22% 
decolorization was observed under shaking condition within 16 h. On the contrary, the UBLICATIONS (MECSJ) CATION AND SCIENCE P SIVE JOURNAL FOR EDU ELECTRONIC COMPREHEN NOWLEDGE  K- MULTI

bacterial growth was lower under static condition as compared to shaking condition 
(Figure 2). Under shaking c ondition, electrons resulting by oxidation of electron 
donors from is used preferentially reduce free oxygen instead of azo dyes [25]. 
Bacteria cannot attack azo dyes, under aerobic conditions [26]. Similar studies were 
confirmed that by other researchers [14]. As a result, the following experiments were 
maintained under static conditions.  
 
Effect of pH  
Decolorization of Direct Red 31(DR 31) by Pseudoalteromonas sp p34 was done by a 
range of pH 4.0 to 10.0. The potential isolate showed a high decolorization  of 100% at 
pH 7.0. The percentage of decolorization decreased gradually from 96%, 63% and 
41% at pH 8, pH 9 and pH10, respectively. While a severe decrease of percent 
decolorization from 88%, 49% and 14% at pH 6, pH5 and pH4, respectively, was 
found (Figu re 3). Similar studies reported that the pH7 might be more suitable for azo 
dyes decolorization and for industrial applications [27].  
 
Effect of Temperature  
During the optimization of temperature, the maximum dye decolorization activity of 
Pseudoalteromona s sp p34 was found by 100% at 30∘C after 16 h(Figure 4). The dye 
decolorization activity of Pseudoalteromonas sp p34 was found with increase in 
temperature by 89% and 91% at 25 and 35∘C, respectively. By increasing the 
temperature, decolorization activity was decreased by 76% and 52% at 40∘C and 
45∘C, respectively, decolorization activity of only 30% was showed at 50∘C. Similar 
results were indicated the same decrease in decolorization around 30∘C [16].This 
result indicates the effect of high temperature on  enzyme activities [28].  
 
Effect of Initial Direct Red 31 Dye Concentration   
 
The percentage of decolorization of Direct Red 31(DR 31) by the Pseudoalteromonas 
sp p34 was studied by a range of initial dye concentration from 100 to 800mg/L, 
gradually, the percentage of decolorization started to decrease with increasing the UBLICATIONS (MECSJ) CATION AND SCIENCE P SIVE JOURNAL FOR EDU ELECTRONIC COMPREHEN NOWLEDGE  K- MULTI

concentration of the dye (Figure 5). It could effectively decolorize up to 100mg/L of 
Direct Red 31  (DR31) (100%) within 16 h and is decreased to 62%, when dye 
concentration increased to 800 mg/L and decolorization time increases from 16 h to 
40 h, respectively. At high concentration of dye, the percentage of decolorization of 
dye decrease due to the pr esence of sulfonic acid groups on Direct Red 31(DR31) 
which inhibit the growth of Pseudoalteromonas sp p34 [14].  
 
 
Effect of Salt Concentration  
 
The percentage of decolorization of Direct Red 31(DR 31) by Pseudoalteromonas sp 
p34 was studied by the effect of salt concentration by a range from 1 to 6% (w/v), 
gradually. It was observed that, the maximum decolorization was at 1 % salt 
concentration by 100% and started to decrease gradually by increasing the percentage 
of salt concentration after 16 h (Figure 6 ). This decreasing was observed as 96%, 72% 
and 42% of decolorization at 2%, 3% and 4% of salt concentration, respectively. Only 
10% of decolorization dye was observed at 6% of salt concentration. Similar reports 
have been confirmed the same results about the effect of higher salt concentration on 
the percentage of decolorization of dye [29]. This is might be due to the higher salt 
concentration that cause inhibition of the bacterial activities. This bacterial inhibition 
was due to the loss of the activity of cells or plasmolysis at high salt concentration 
[30].  
 
Effect of Different Yeast Extract Concentrations  
Yeast extract considered as a better nitrogen source for decolorization of Direct Red 
31(DR31) [14].The effect of yeast extract of different  concent rations (0.1 –2.0 g/L) on 
the decolorization of Direct Red 31(DR31) (100mg/L) by Pseudoalteromonas sp p34 , 
was studied. It was observed that, decolorization dye started to increase by 55, 71 and 
90%, respectively, by increasing concentration of yeast extrac t by 0.1, 0.25 and 
0.5g/L. Addition of 1 g/L of yeast extract complete the decolorization of Direct Red 
31(DR 31) by 100%. By increasing yeast extract concentration, there is no change on UBLICATIONS (MECSJ) CATION AND SCIENCE P SIVE JOURNAL FOR EDU ELECTRONIC COMPREHEN NOWLEDGE  K- MULTI

the decolorization activity (Figure 7). Various nitrogen sources pla y an important role 
as they act as an electron donor in the decolorization of azo dyes.  
 
Decolorization of Different Azo Dyes  
Four different azo dyes were used in this study. Pseudoalteromonas sp p34 was tested 
for its ability to decolorize four other dif ferent azo dyes such as Direct Blue 90, Direct 
Brown 115, Direct Green 26 and Direct Orange 39. The strain showed the ability to 
degrade all different azo dyes within 36 h (Table 2). The efficiency was 98, 94, 89 
and 79% for Direct Blue 90, Direct Brown 11 5, Direct Green 26 and Direct Orange 
39, respectively. The presence of sulfonic groups in the four tested dyes affect the 
variation of decolorization[31].  
 
The decrease in peak at the respective absorption maximum of the studied azo dye 
suggests the cleav age of -N=N - bond by the anaerobic reductive degradation of the  
azo dye. However, we can observe a difference in UV -Vis spectral pattern before and 
after decolorization (Figure 8).  
 
 In conclusion, it can be concluded from the above study that, a bacteria l strain 
Pseudoalteromonas sp p34 is capable of degrading Direct Red 31(DR 31) as a  carbon 
source of under static condition. The potential bacterial strain has the capability  to 
decolorize Direct Red 31(DR 31) at the most suitable temperature is 25 –40∘C and pH 
6.0–9.0, salt, and initial dye concentrations. Furthermore, strain Pseudoalteromonas 
sp p34  had the ability to decolorize four other different azo dyes therefore, 
Pseudoalteromonas sp p34 can be used for the decolorization of various azo dyes.
