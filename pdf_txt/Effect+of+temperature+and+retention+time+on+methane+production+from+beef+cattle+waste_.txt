This report describes the results of a research project to produce 
energy in the form of methane and a high protein feed supplement from 
livestock manure. This work was jointly funded by the US Department 
of Agriculture, through the Science and Education Administration, 
and the US Department of Energy, through the Solar Energy Research 
Institute. 
The results of this research indicates that there are many livestock 
operations where thermophillic fermentation of livestock manure would 
be both technically feasible and economically attractive. The develop­
ment of this technology has now reached the point where a significant 
commercialization effort is needed, aimed at integrating such fermen­
tation units into livestock production operations. 
The USDA and DOE are currently working out arrangements for such a 
program.

This report summarizes the research being conducted at the Roman L. Hruska 
U.S. Meat Animal Research Center to convert livestock manure and crop residues 
into methane and a high protein feed ingredient by thermophilic anaerobic 
fermentation. The major biological and operational factors involved in metha­
nogenesis were discussed, and a kinetic model that describes the fermentation 
process was presented. Substrate biodegradability, fermentation temperature, 
and influent substrate concentration were shown to have significant effects on 
CH4 production rate. The kinetic model predicted methane production rates of 
existing pilot and full-scale fermentation systems to within 15%. 
The 5.7 m3 fermentor was operated at: temperatures of 45, 50 and 55°C; 
hydraulic retention times ranging from 12 to 4 days; mixed continuously or 2 
hr/day; and fed once/day or 22 times/day. No difference in methane production 
rate was observed when the fermentor was mixed 2 hr/day versus continuously. 
The methane production rate was about 10% higher when the fermentor was fed 22 
times/day compared with once/day. The highest methane production rate 
achieved by the fermentor was 4.7 L CH4/L fermentor·day. This is the highest 
rate reported in the literature and about 4 times higher than other pilot or 
full-scale systems fermenting livestock manures. 
Assessment of the energy requirements for anaerobic fermentation systems 
showed that the major energy requi rement for a thermophi 1 i c system was for 
maintaining the fermentor temperature. Of the total heating energy required, 
about 89 to 94% was for heating the influent slurry at an ambient temperature 
of 10°C. The next major energy consumption was due to the mixing of the 
influent slurry and fermentor liquor. Mixing amounted to 7.3% of the gross 
methane energy production, assuming continuous mixing. The least energy was 
consumed in pumping. The total energy required for mixing and pumping 
accounted for 10.8 to 11.3% of the gross thermal energy production. 
An approach to optimizing anaerobic fermentor designs by selecting design cri­
teria that maximize the net energy production per unit cost was presented. 
Using this optimization technique, we estimated that a farmer-constructed and 
operated system would be economically feasible for beef feedlots between 1,000 
to 2,000 head without a feed credit assumed for the effluent, and about 300 
head with a feed credit of $60/~1g effluent total solids. Commercial 
"turn-key" systems are only feasible for feedlots larger than 8,000 head with 
no effluent credit, and feedlots between 1,000 to 2,000 head with an effluent 
credit of $60/t~g. Based on these results, we bel i eve that the economi cs of 
anaerobic fermentation is sufficiently favorable for farm-scale demonstration 
of this technology. ;i

PRINCIPLES OF METHANE PRODUCTION 
A. G. Hashimoto, Y. R. Chen, and V. H. Varel 
2.1 INTRODUCTION 
Methane (CH4) is produced in nature through the anaerobic decomposition of 
organic matter. Since bacteria are the predominant species involved in 
methanogenesis, this discussion on the principles of CH4 production deals with 
the bacteria involved in methanogenesis and the factors that affect both the 
rate of CH4 production and the amount of organic matter that can be converted 
to CH4' 
2.2 MICROBIOLOGY 
Methanogenesis has traditionally been viewed as a two-stage process --the 
acid-forming and CH4-forming stages (Kirsch and Sykes, 1971; Torien and 
Hattingh, 1969). In the first stage, acid-forming bacteria were thought to 
ferment organic materials, like carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins to for­
mate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, ethanol, hydrogen (H2) and carbon dioxide 
(C02). Bryant (1976, 1979) and t·1cI nerny and Bryant (1978) proposed a three­
stage scheme that attempts to synthesi ze more current i nformati on on methano­
genesis from organic matter. In general, the first stage involves species of 
fermentative bacteria which, as a metabolic group, hydrolyze complex car­
bohydrates, proteins, and lipids and ferment these products to fatty acids, 
H2, and C02' The second metabolic group, called the "H2-producing acetogenic 
bacteri a II produce acetate, C02 and H2 from the fatty aci ds generated in the 
first stage. The third stage involves the methanogenic bacteria that utilize 
the products of the first two stages --mainly acetate, C02, and H2 to produce 
CH4 and C02' Recently, an additional stage was added to this scheme, as shown 
in Figure 2.1. This metabolic group is called the homoacetogenic bacteria 
which are reported to synthesize acetate using H2, C02, and formate (Zeikus, 
1979; Wolfe, 1979). t~ethanogenesis in the gastrointestinal tract of animals 
involves only the first metabolic group and H2 utilization by methanogens 
(Hungate, 1966). Acetogenic bacteria are not significantly involved due to 
the short retention times in these ecosystems. Acetate and other volatile 
acids accumulate in rumen, fecal, and colon fermentations and are utilized as 
major energy sources by herbivorous animal s. 
Most of the information concerning extracellular intermediates important in 
methanogenesis comes from studies of rumen and sewage sludge fermentations 
(Hobson et al., 1974; Hungate, 1966, Torien and Hattingh, 1969; Wolin, 1974). 
Acetate is an important precursor in nature because about 70% of the CH4 
produced in sludge is produced via the methyl group of acetate (Kugelman and 
McCarty, 1965; Smith and Mah, 1966). Mountfort and Asher (1978) found that 
during the first few hours after a beef-manure fermentor is fed, up to 90% of 
the CH4 produced comes from acetate. Reduction of C02 by H2, and to some 
extent by other intermediate electron donors, accounts for the rest of the 
CH4 production. Winfrey et al. (1977) showed that H2 is an important inter­
mediate and a rate-limiting factor in lake sediment methanogenesis. Formate 
is rapidly converted to H2 and C02 by nonmethanogens or is directly utilized 
by methanogens (Hungate, 1966). COMPLEX ORGANIC MATTER

Succinate is a major extracellular intermediate in the rumen, which is rapidly 
decarboxyl ated to propi onate (Hungate, 1966; Scheifi nger et al., 1973). Other 
than acetate and H2, propionate is probably the most important intermediate in 
methanogenes i s (~1cCarty, 1964c; Smith and Mah, 1966). Kaspar and Wuhrman 
(1978) calculated that 15% of the total steady-state CH4 production is derived 
from propionate. Definitive kinetic studies, such as those of Smith and Mah 
(1966) on acetate, have not been reported on butyrate or longer carbon-chained 
acids. 
Ethanol and lactate are probably not important intermediates. Organisms pro­
duce these products to dispose of electrons generated in glycolysis, but they 
also produce H2' In the natural system, H2-using methanogenic bacteria 
rapidly use the H2' which allows the fermentative bacteria to produce more H2 
and acetate and less lactate and ethanol. Thus, in the rumen, ethanol is 
neither produced nor used, though many bacteri al speci es produce ethanol in 
pure culture (Hungate, 1966). Only under stress of feeding high substrate 
levels does lactate become an important intermediate in the rumen. Wolin 
(1974, 1976) and Bryant (1976, 1979) discussed in detail the research dealing 
with al tered el ectron flow in the di recti on of H2 producti on caused by the 
metabolic interactions of methanogens and nonmethanogens. 
2.3 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Environmental factors influence the rate and amount of CH4 produced during 
methanogenesis. Some of the major environmental factors are pH, alkalinity, 
volatile acids, temperature, nutrients, and toxic materials. Several authors 
have reviewed the influence of these factors on methanogenesis (Mah et al., 
1977; Wolfe, 1971; Zeikus, 1977; Hobson et al., 1974; Torien and Hattingh, 
1969; Speece and McCarty, 1964; Kirsch and Sykes, 1971). 
2.3.1 EJ:!. 
The methanogenic and acetogenic bacteria seem to be sensitive to pH. The pH, 
in turn, is a function of the bicarbonate alkalinity, the C02 partial pressure, 
and the vol ati 1 e aci ds concentrati on. ~lcCarty (1964a). reported that CH4 
production proceeds quite well as long as the pH is maintained between 6.6 and 
7.6, with an optimum range between 7.0 and 7.2. At pH values below 6.2, toxi­
city is acute. Alkali should be added to maintain the pH above 6.6. High pH 
can be a problem with CH4 production from animal manure because of the high 
levels of ammonia generated at high organic loading rates (Jewell et al., 1976). 
2.3.2 Alkalinity 
Alkalinity is a measure of the buffering capacity of the fermentor contents 
and consists of the bicarbonate, carbonate, ammonia, and hydroxide components. 
Organic acids and acid salts may also contribute to the buffering capacity 
(Am. Public Health Assoc., 1975). ~1cCarty (1964a) indicated that a bicar­
bonate alkalinity in the range of 2.5 to 5.0 g CaC03/L provides a safe buf­
fering capacity for anaerobic treatment of waste. Sievers and Brune (1978) 
and Kroeker et al. (1979) reported on the importance of ammonia in buffering 
animal manure fermentations. The relatively low carbon:nitrogen ratio of ani­
mal manures was reported as a major factor in the stability of animal manure 
fermentations. Ammonia was reported to contribute to the process stability by 
increasing the bicarbonate buffering capacity and increasing the pH. 5 
2.3.3 Volatile Acids 
McCarty and ~1cKinney (1961) found that volatile acid levels should remain 
below 2.0 g acetatelL for efficient fermentation. Above this level, the acids 
were toxic. This seems to hold true for thermophilic temperatures also, as 
Varel et al. (1977) reported less efficient CH4 production from cattle manure 
when the level of organic acids rose above 2.0 giL. Kroeker et al. (1979) 
showed acute methanogenic toxicity at unionized volatile acid concentrations 
between 30 to 60 mglL as acetic acid. This corresponded to total volatile 
acid concentrations between 1.65 to 2.6 giL as acetic acid. 
2.3.4 Temperature 
Temperature is an important environmental parameter in anaerobic fermentation 
processes. Faster fermentation rates, faster solid-liquid separation and 
minimization of bacterial and viral pathogens are some benefits attributed to 
thermophilic fermentation (Pfeffer, 1974; Cooney and Wise, 1975). Pfeffer 
(1974) used shredded municipal refuse to establish ~NO optimum temperatures. 
The optimum in the mesophilic and thermophilic range was 42 and 60°C, 
respectively. He al so concluded that it Itlas less expensive to produce CH4 at 
the higher temperature. A definite acclimation period was required to ini­
tiate thermophilic fermentation. Buhr and Andrews (1977) stated that although 
the literature is contradictory, minor fluctuations in temperature can cause 
problems for thermophilic fermentors. Golueke(1958) found that the total 
volatile acids increased as temperature increased between 35 and 65°C. 
Although the rates of reaction in the thermophilic range are much faster than 
those in the mesophi 1 i c range, most sewage sl udge fermentati on systems have 
operated under mesophilic conditions (McCarty, 1964a). In the past, energy 
requirements to maintain thermophilic temperatures were thought to be 
excessive due to the high water content of sewage sludges. Studies on urban 
refuse indicate that thermophilic temperatures are more economical and effi­
cient for CH4 production (Pfeffer and Liebman, 1976; Pfeffer, 1974). Results 
published in this report show that thermophilic fermentation of beef cattle 
manure is more economical than mesophilic fermentation. 
2.3.5 Nutrients 
Another important envi ronmental conditi on is the presence of the nutri ents, 
like nitrogen, phosphorous, sulfur, and trace nutrients, needed by bacteria 
(Bryant, 1974; Bryant et al., 1971; ~lcCarty, 1964a). Animal manures and muni­
cipal sewage sludges usually contain all the required nutrients in adequate 
quantities, but other substrates may not. Pfeffer and Liebman (1976) found 
that municipal refuse was deficient in nitrogen and phosphorous. McCarty 
(1964b) reported that other elements having stimulatory effects at low con­
centrations include sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and iron. All of 
these elements can exhibit inhibitory effects at higher concentrations. In 
general, the bacteria involved in methanogenesis have simple nutrient require­
ments and, although various individual species may require growth factors 
(e.g., B-vitamins, fatty acids, amino acids), these are supplied by other 
bacterial species (Bryant, 1974; Bryant et al., 1971). 
The relative proportion of nutrients is also important in methanogenesis. 
Hills (1979) reported a 60 to 70% increase in CH4 yield when the carbon:nitrogen 
ratio was increased from 8 to 25 by adding glucose or cellulose. Since most 
animal manures have carbon:nitrogen ratios between 6 to 10, the potential to 6 
increase CH4 yields by adding carbonaceous materials to manures is apparent. 
The practical limitation of this concept, however, is that most crop residues 
are even less biodegradable than animal manures. Thus, pretreatment of crop 
residues is necessary to increase their biodegradability. 
2.3.6 Toxic Materials 
Other environmental factors involve toxicities resulting from excessive quan­
tities of organic or inorganic substances. The threshold toxic levels of 
inorganic substances vary depending on whether the substr'ates act singly or in 
combination. Certain combinations have synergistic effects, whereas others 
display antagonistic effects (~1cCarty, 1946b; Kugelman and r~cCarty, 1965). 
Several investigators have implicated high concentrations of sulfate in 
retarding CH4 production. But recently, Bryant et al. (1977) and Winfrey and 
Zeikus (1977) have independently proposed that competition for available H2 is 
the mechanism by which sulfate inhibits w~thanogenesis in natural ecosystems. 
The sulfate-reducing bacteria apparently scavenge the available H2 faster than 
the methanogens. 
Inhibition by ammonia is a significant problem with some high rate fermen­
tation processes, particularly when ammonia-rich manure from swine and poultry 
are fermented, and a proper acclimation period is not permitted (Lapp et al., 
1975; Stevens and Schulte, 1979; Sievers and Brune, 1978; Kroeker et al., 
1979; Converse et al., 1977a). fvlcCarty (1964b) reported that at concentrations 
between 1.5 and 3.0 giL of total ammonia nitrogen and at a pH greater than 
7.4, the unionized ammonia may inhibit methanogenesis. At concentrations 
above 3.0 giL, ammonia becomes toxic regardless of pH. However, Lapp et al. 
(1975), Converse et al. (1977a) and Fischer et al. (1979) have reported stable 
CH4 production with ammonia concentrations in excess of 3.0 giL (2.2 to 8.0 
giL). Kroeker et al. (1979) used a urea and acetic-acid substrate to investi­
gate the effect of ammonia inhibition on CH4 production. They concluded that 
CH4 was progressively inhibited as the ammonia nitrogen concentration 
increased above 2 giL; however, toxicity (i.e., complete cessation of CH4 
production) did not occur even at ammonia nitrogen concentrations of 7.0 giL. 
Antibiotics and growth promoters used in livestock rations can inhibit or even 
completely stop methanogenesis. Turnocliff and Custer (1978) reported that 
operating an anaerobic fermentation system where the antibiotic lincomycin is 
used is probably futile. Fischer et al. (1978) also reported severe fermentor 
instability 'r/hen lincomycin was used in swine rations to control dysentery. 
Hashimoto et al. (1979) reported that chlortetracycline had no adverse effect 
on methanogenesis, but that monensin nearly doubled the time (from 20 to 40 
days) for the start of CH4 production in batch fermentations. After the bac­
teria adapted to the monensin, however, the fermentation proceeded at rates 
comparable to batch fermentations without monensin. Three possible mechanisms 
may explain the apparent adaptation of the bacteria to monensin or any other 
antibiotic: a) mutant strains of bacteria develop resistance to the 
antibiotic; b) microbial populations shift as the result of inhibition of some 
bacteria and increase in others; andlor c) the antibiotic is deactivated 
during the lag period. Chen and Wolin (1979) have evidence suggesting that 
the first two mechanisms listed above explain the role of monensin in the 
rumen. The Rumensin Technical Manual (Eli Lilly Co., 1975) shows that one 
part per million of monensin in soil samples is deactivated in 14 days when 
incubated with animal feces, and in 25 days when incubated without feces. 
Experiments on daily feeding of manure containing monensin to fermentors show 7 
unstable fermentation except at very long hydraulic retention times (30 to 40 
days) (Yarel and Hashimoto, 1981). More research on the effects of anti­
biotics on methanogenesis is necessary since antibiotics are widely used in 
livestock production.

2.4 FERMENTATION KINETICS 
2.4.1 Kinetic Models 
It is important to understand the kinetics of CH4 fermentation to design and 
operate optimum systems. Several kinetic models have been used to describe 
the anaerobi c fermentati on process. The Monod (1950) ki neti c model has been 
adapted to describe the anaerobic digestion kinetics of sewage sludge 
(OIRourke, 1968; Lawrence and McCarty, 1969; Andrews and Pearson, 1965) and 
animal manures (Morris, 1976; Hill and Barth, 1977). The advantages of the 
Monod type model are that the ki neti c parameters (the mi croorgani sm maximum 
specific growth rate and half-velocity constant) have deterministic con­
notations that describe the microbial processes, and the model can predict the 
conditions when maximum biological activity occurs and when activity ceases 
(i.e., wash-out). Disadvantages of the Monod model are that one set of kine­
tic parameters cannot describe the biological process at short and long reten­
tion times (Garrett and Sawyer, 1952; Chiu et al., 1972a,b), and that the 
kinetic parameters cannot be obtained for certain complex substrates (Pfeffer, 
1974) . 
To overcome the disadvantages of the Monad model, various forms of the first­
order kinetic model have been used (McKinney, 1962; Eckenfelder, 1963; Grau et 
al., 1975; Grady .et al., 1972; Pfeffer, 1974; Morris, 1976). The advantages 
of the first-order models are that they are simple to use and give good fit of 
experimental data. Disadvantages are that they do not predict the conditions 
for maximum biological activity and system failure. 
The Contois (1959) kinetic model has the advantages and generally avoids the 
di sadvantages inherent in the ~lonod model. The Contoi s model was adapted to 
describe the kinetics of CH4 fermentation as follows (Chen and Hashimoto, 
1978) : 
where: [1 - K ] 
e~m - 1 + K 
Yy = volumetric CH4 production rate, L CH4/L fermentor'day; 
So = influent total volatile solids (YS) concentration, giL; 
Bo =' ultimate CH4 yield, L CH4/9 VS added as e ---7 00; 
e = hydraulic retention time, day; 
~m = maximum specific growth rate of microorganisms, day-I; 
K = kinetic parameter, dimensionless. (2.1 ) 
Equation 2.1 states that for a given loading rate (Sole), the daily volume of 8 
CH4 per volume of fermentor depends on the biodegradability of the material (Bo) 
and the kinetic parameters ~m and K. 
2.4.2 Ultimate Methane Yield (Bo) 
Equation 2.1 shows that the amount of CH4 produced is directly proportional to 
the ultimate CH4 yield (Bo)' Bo can be determined by two methods: 1) plotting 
the steady-state CH4 yield (L CH4/9 VS fed) versus the reciprocal of the 
retention time and extrapolating to an infinite hydraulic retention time 
(i.e., l/e = 0); or 2) incubating a known amount of substrate until a negli­
gible amount of CH4 is produced (long-term batch fermentation). These two 
methods gave similar estimates of Bo for beef cattle manure fermented at tem­
peratures ranging from 30 to 65°C at 5°C intervals (Hashimoto et al., 1979). 
There was no effect of temperature on Bo' and 80 averaged 0.32 ± 0.01 L CH4/9 
VS fed for the steady-state method and 0.328 ± 0.022 L CH4/9 VS fed for the 
batch method. 
For livestock manures, Bo depends on the specie, ration, the age of the 
manure, the collection and storage method, and the amount of foreign material 
(like dirt and bedding) incorporated in the manure. Table 2.1 shows some 
values of Bo determined for beef cattle manure (Hashimoto et al., 1979) .. 
Table 2.1 shows that the manure from cattle fed higher grain rations had 
greater Bo val ues than that from ani'mal s fed hi gher roughage rati ons. Thi s is 
an expected result since rations containing higher levels of roughage would 
contain greater amounts of lignin complexed with cellulose. Table 2.1 also 
shows that chlortetracycline and monensin do not affect Bo' but 6 to 8 week 
01 d manU.re from a di rt feedlot has a lower 80 than fresh manure. Based upon 
the trends noted above, we have estimated Bo (L CH4/9 VS fed) for confined 
beef to be 0.35 ± 0.05, beef manure from dirt lots to be 0.25 ± 0.05; dairy 
manure to be 0.20 ± 0.05; and swine manure to be 0.50 ± 0.05. More studies 
are needed to refine these estimates and to determine other factors that 
affect methane yield. 
2.4.3 Maximum Specific Growth Rate (~m) 
Figure 2.2 shows the relationship between temperature and llm' The values of 
~m shown in Figure 2.2 were estimated by Chen and Hashimoto (1978) from data 
on anaerobic fermentations of sewage sludge (O'Rourke, 1968), municipal refuse 
(Pfeffer, 1974), dairy cattle manure (Morris, 1976; Bryant et al., 1976) and 
beef cattle manure (Varel et al., 1977). 
Figure 2.2 shows that a straight line can be drawn between most of the data 
between 20 and 60°C. This relationship is described by the following 
equation: 
~m = 0.013 (T) -0.129 (2.2) 
where T is the temperature between 20 and 60°C. Temperatures above 60°C 
sharply decrease ~m' The data that do not conform to Equation 2.2 are those 
of Pfeffer at 40 and 45°C and those of Bryant et al. and Varel et al. at 60°C. 
Analysis of Pfeffer's data shows a large variation in Bo and K with 
temperature, indicating a variation in composition of the refuse fed to the 
various fermentors. The high values of ~m for the data of Bryant et al. and 
Varel et al. may have resulted from the limited amount of data (three 
relatively short hydraulic retention times: 3, 6 and 9 days) available to 9

estimate Bo' ~m and K. The problems experienced in estimating these parame­
ters are discussed elsewhere (Chen and Hashimoto, 1978). 
2.4.4 Kinetic Parameter (K) 
Equation 2.1 shows that when Bo' So' e, and ~m are constant and K increases, 
the CH4 production rate (ry) decreases. Thus, an increase in K indicates, some 
type of inhibition has occurred. This inhibition may be caused by one or more 
of the following: overloading (i.e., more substrate is being added to the 
system than the bacteria can effectively use); inhibitory substances (e.g., 
volatile acids, ammonia, heavy metals, and salts) exceeding threshold levels; 
or reduced mass transfer of substrate, products, or both, because of the 
higher solids concentration. 
Figure 2.3 shows the effect of influent volatile solids (YS) concentration on 
K for swine manure at 35°C, and cattle manure at 32.5 and 60°C. The K values 
for swine manure were calculated from the data of Summers and Bousfield 
(1980). We estimated the Bo for their manure to be 0.36 L CH4/9 YS fed by 
plotting the CH4 yield (L CH4/9 YS fed) versus lie and extrapolating to an 
infinite e. This Bo is lower than what we suggest for U.S. swine manure (0.50 
L CH4/9 YS fed), which may have been caused by the diet (barley rather than 
corn) and the use of bedding (sawdust) to house the swine. Also, the lower YS 
content (70% rather than the 80 to 85% for fresh swine manure in the U.S.) of 
their manure suggests that some YS were destroyed before fermentation or that 
a larger portion of the VS in the ration was used by the swine. Both of these 
factors would decrease Bo' 
The values for Bo "'Jere 0.245 L CH4/9 VS fed for dairy cattle manure at 32.5°C 
(data of Morrois, 1976), 0.169 L CH4/9 VS fed for dairy cattle manure at 60°C 
(data of Bryant et al., 1976), and 0.280 L CH4/9 VS fed for beef cattl e manure 
at 60°C (data of Chen and Hashimoto, 1978). ° 
We estimated the values for ~ using Equation 2.2; we calculated K by substi­
tuting the cited values of Bo' ~m' So and e for each data set into Equation 
2.1 and solving for K. 
Figure 2.3 shows that K is relatively constant (about 0.6) at low So' but 
increases at different So depending upon the fermentation temperature and 
manure type. The value of K begins increasing at 35 g VS/L for swine manure 
at 35°C, 40 9 VS/L for cattle manure at 32.5°C and 60 g VS/L for cattle manure 
at 60°C. This behavior of K seems logical, because overloading a fermentor 
inhibits CH4 formation, and thermophilic fermentors can sustain a higher 
loading rate than mesophilic fermentors before onset of inhibition (Varel et 
al., 1980). The effect of manure type on K may be caused by differences in 
ration digestible energy, differences in digestion (rumen versus monogastric) 
and/or the presence of inhibitory substances in the swine ration (e.g., the 
swine ration contained 200 ppm of copper). 
Figure 2.3 should be used with caution because several data sources ,,,ere used 
and these experiments were not planned to evaluate the kinetic parameters. A 
systematic study using identical apparatus and procedures is necessary to 
verify the preliminary results shown in Figure 2.3. Also, the presence of 
inhibitory substances in the manure would cause K to increase at a lower So 
than shown in Figure 2.3. 0::

2.4.5 Application of the Kinetic Model 
Equation 2.1 was used to predict Yy of various pilot-and full-scale systems 
fermenting livestock manures at 35, 55 and 60°C (Table 2.2). Figure 2.2 was 
used to estimate ~m at each temperature and Figure 2.3 was used to estimate K 
at each So' 'Values for Bo were assumed to be 0.20 L CH4/9 VS fed for dairy 
cattle manure and 0.50 L CH4/9 VS fed for swine manure except when Bo could be 
calculated (the data of Summers and Bousfield, 1980). 
Table 2.2 shows the experimental and predicted Yy along with the operational 
and kinetic parameters used to estimate Yv. It al so shows the ratio of the 
predicted to experimental Yv. Most of the predicted values are within 15% of 
the experimental value of Yy except for the dairy manure fermented at 60°C. 
This predictive capacity is quite good, considering that ~m and K, and Bo in 
most instances, were independently determined and had not been adjusted to fit 
the experimental data. 
2.5 SUMMARY 
This Section summarizes the major biological and operational factors involved 
in methanogenesis. A kinetic model that describes the fermentation process 
was presented and applied as a starting point in understanding and optimizing 
the fermentation process. Substrate biodegradability, fermentation 
temperature, and influent substrate concentration were shown to have signifi­
cant effects on CH4 production rate. The CH4 production rates of existing 
pilot and full-scale fermentation systems were predicted to within 15% using 
this kinetic model. TABLE 2.2. EXPERII~ENTAL MJD PREDICTED VOLUlvlETRIC METHANE PRODUCTION RATES

PILOT-SCALE THERMOPHILIC FERMENTOR OPERATION 
A. G. Hashimoto 
3.1 INTRODUCTION 
Thermophil i c anaerobi c fermentati on of 1 i v'estock manures has several advantages 
that make it attractive for more detailed investigation. This system has the 
potential for significantly higher CH4 production rate, with resultant savings 
in capital expenditures. Also, the residue is sanitized; therefore, disease 
transmission is minimized. This is especially important if the product is to 
be refed to livestock. Laboratory studies have demonstrated higher CH4 pro­
duction rates at thermophilic than mesophilic temperatures. Augenstein et al. 
(1976) showed about four times higher CH4 production rates at 60°C than at 37°C 
for anaerobic cultures being fed C02 and H2' Likewise, Pfeffer (1974) showed 
a four-fold increase in reaction rate at 60°C compared to 35°C for cultures 
fed domestic refuse. Varel et al. (1977) reported the highest CH4 production 
rate (4.5 L CH4/Lfermentor'day) for beef cattle manure fermented at 60°C. 
Converse et al. (1977b) compared the pilot-scale anaerobic fermentation of 
dairy waste at mesophilic (37°C) and thermophilic (60°C) temperatures. Their 
thermophilic CH4 production rate was lower than the laboratory results 
reported by Varel et al. (1977) and close to those obtained by their mesophi­
lic fermentor. They proposed the following possible explanations for the 
unexpectedly low gas yields of their thermophilic fermentor: insufficient 
mixing; wide temperature fluctuations in fermentor; less efficient microflora 
in their system; less biodegradable manure in their system; lower system effi­
ciency because of improper scale-up factors. 
The need for improved design criteria and scale-up factors for thermophilic, 
anaerobic fermentation systems is apparent. One of the objectives of this 
project was to determine the design factors necessary to achieve the high gas 
yields obtained by laboratory-scale thermophilic fermentors. 
3.2 EQUIPMENT AND PROCEDURES 
3.2.1 Pilot-Plant Facilities 
Figure 3.1 is a schematic diagram of the pilot-scale fermentation system. The 
pilot-scale facilities were constructed under contract with Hamilton Standard 
Division of United Technologies, Inc. Manure (1 to 10 days old) was gathered 
daily from steers housed on partially roofed, concrete-floored pens. The 
steers weighed from 340 to 570 kg, depending on the season. Table 3.1 shows 
the rations fed to the cattle over the 1319 days of fermentor operation. 
The manure was transported to the pilot plant by a small front-end loader and 
dumped into the s1 urry tank. Itlater was added to the materi alto form a sl urry 
of 12 to 14% total solids (TS). The slurry i'laS mixed by a 1-kltl variable speed 
mixer. Based upon the TS and volatile solids (VS) analyses, a given amount of 
slurry was pumped into a 1-m3 tank on a platform scale, the weight of the 
slurry transferred was recorded, and water was added to dilute the slurry to a 
specified VS concentration. o = PUMP

The slurry in the weight tank was mixed by a 0.25-kW dual-propeller mixer 
while the slurry was being pumped into the heat exchange loop and into the 
fermentor. The heat exchanger consisted of three, 6-m-long concentric tubes 
connected in series such that the slurry was pumped through the inner tube 
while hot water was pumped through the outer tube. Slurry from the fermentor 
was continuously pumped through the heat exchanger at 0.0032 m3/sec. 
A schematic diagram of the fermentor and mixer is shown in Figure 3.2. The 
fermentor volume was 5.7 m3 with a working volume of 5.4 m3 during the first 
248 days of operation and 5.1 m3 for the remainder of the study. The fermen­
tor had four baffles equally spaced around the tank and the mixer consisted of 
a 1.5 kW variable-speed motor and two, 3-blade, stainless steel, marine pro­
pellers on a stainless steel shaft. The following geometric relationships 
were used: fermentor diameter (T) to propeller diameter (D) ratio, T/D = 5.6; 
propeller spacing of 2.50; baffle width (W) of-T/W = 14; and spacing between 
baffle and fermentor wall W/2. 
The gas produced during the fermentation passed through condensate-foam traps, 
a temperature-compensated gas meter, and a pressure relief valve. The 
condensate-foam trap consisted of a cylindrical tank, 0.53 m in diameter and 
1.73 m high, with a siphon calibrated to discharge when the pressure exceeds 
0.25 m of water column. This has reduced the frequency of draining condensate 
from the gas flow meters and has eliminated the need to disassemble and clean 
the gas line after excessive foaming. The CH4 and C02 concentration is 
measured by a gas chromatograph several times each day. 
The pilot-plant facilities are housed in a 14 x 8.5 m building which also con­
tains an office and laboratory facilities for determining solids, pH and 
a 1 k ali n ity • 
3.2.2 Methods 
Before adding fresh slurry to the fermentor, a specified volume of fermented 
slurry, corresponding to the desired hydraulic retention time (HRT) , was 
removed. The fermented slurry was either mixed directly with other feed 
ingredients for livestock feeding trials or centrifuged. The centrate flowed 
to a lagoon for ultimate land applicatibn, and the centrifuge cake was dried 
at 70°C, then used as a feed ingredient for livestock feeding trials. 
Samples of slurries fed and withdrawn from the fermentor were routinely ana­
lyzed for various constituents. Total, volatile, fixed and suspended solids, 
ammonia (distillation method), chemical oxygen demand, alkalinity (to pH 3.7), 
pH, and total volatile acids (TVA, silicic acid method) were determined by the 
methods outlined in Standard Methods (APHA, 1975). Total Kjeldahl nitrogen 
was determined using Technicon block digestors and Auto-Analyzer II as 
described by Wael and Gehrke (1975). 
Daily gas production was measured by an American AL-175 gas meter with tem­
perature compensati on capabi 1 i ty. Gas vol ume was corrected to standard tem­
perature (O°C) and pressure (1 atmosphere). CH4 and C02 concentrations were 
measured using an on-line, Gow Mac Series 550 gas chromatograph with thermal 
conductivity detectors. The stainless steel column (0.64 by 183 cm) was 
packed with 60/80 mesh chromosorb 102. Injector, oven and detector tem­
peratures were 102, 100 and 131°C, respectively, with a bridge current of 100 
m.a. Helium carrier gas flow was 60 ml/min. 19

3.3 FERMENTOR OPERATION 
3.3.1 Start-Up 
Start-up commenced on November 30, 1976 with a charge of 50 kg of VS in 3.2 m3 
of water previously heated to 52°C. The manure charged to the system was 1 to 
7 days old and contained 30% TS and 84% VS. Slaked lime (13.7 kg) was added 
during the first 5 days of operation to maintain the pH at 7. After day 6 of 
operation, the pH began to increase with a concomitant increase in gas produc­
tion and decrease in TVA. Daily charging of manure began on day 9 with a 
loading of 1.6 kg YS/m3 of tank contents. 
Figure 3.3 shows the change in pH and accumulated gas production during 
start-up. After 6 days, the gas production increased dramatically. Figure 
3.4 shows that the alkalinity increased during start-up and that the TVA 
increased to 3.5 gil as HOAc at day 6 of operation, then steadily decreased to 
below 1 gil after 10 days. Within 9 days, significant gas production was 
achieved. This agrees with the experiences of Varel et al. (1977) for their 
laboratory-scale fermentors. 
The fermentor loading was gradually increased from 1.6 to 2 .. 4 kg YS/m3 between 
days 9 and 37 of operat1on. On day 38, the fermentor reached the desired 
operating volume (5.4 m ) and daily effluent withdrawal commenced. The 
hydraul i c retenti on ti me (HRT) was gradually decreased to 20 gays on day 56. 
The temperature was raised to 55°C and loading of 5.4 kg VS/m on day 63. The 
loading was decreased to 3.4 kg YS/m3 on day 73 because the TVA began to 
increase. 
3.3.2 Steady-State Operation 
The fermentor performance was eval uated at vari ous operati ng conditions to 
define optimum design criteria. The fermentor was operated at each condition 
for at least four HRT before steady-state data were recorded. 
Tables 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 summarize the steady-state performance of the 
fermentor under different operating conditions. These tables .show that the 
volumetric CH4 production rate increases as the loading rate increases; the F,S 
in the effluent was close to the influent FS, indicating that the fermentor 
contents were completely mixed; and that little nitrogen was lost during 
fermentation. 
Table 3.2 summarizes the fermentor performance at 55°C, fed once daily and mixed 
continuously. It shows that the CH4 yield (L CH4/9 VS fed (VSf») decreased as 
the HRT decreased, and that the L CH4/9 YS used (VSu) averaged 0.54. 
Table 3.3 summarizes the fermentor performance at 45 and 50°C, fed once daily 
and mixed continuously. The first three steady-states in Table 3.3 (So = 
65.3, 61.5 and 77.1 g VS/L) showed unusually low yields of 0.36, 0.39 and 0.30 
L CH4/9 YSu' These low yields prompted an intensive search for gas leaks from 
the fermentor and gas handling system. The search revealed a small leak 
around the packed bearing of the propeller shaft and a significant leak 
through the secondary gas-relief valve. The last steady-state in Table 3.3 
(So = 80.2 g VS/L) shows the fermentor performance after the gas leaks were 
sealed. The CH4 yields were much higher than the three previous steady-state 
yields. 21

Table 3.4 summarizes the fermentor performance at 50°C, 6 days HRT, once daily 
feeding and mixed continuously or 2 hr/day. Table 3.4 shows that there is no 
difference in performance when the fermentor is mixed continuously or only 2 
hr/day. Based on these results, it is difficult to justify the increased 
energy needed to continuously mix the fermentor when there is no apparent 
increase in CH4 production rates. However, these steady-state trials were not 
long enough to assess the long-term effect that intermittent mixing may have 
on sediment accumulation in the fermentor. If intermittent mixing allows 
solids deposition in the fermentor, the fermentor volume would decrease. This 
decrease in effective fermentor volume affects important operational parameters 
such as HRT and loading rate. Thus, the mixing requirement for fermentation 
systems may be based on the materials handling and fermentor design aspects 
rather than maximum CH4 production rates. More research is needed on the 
materials handling function of mixing systems in anaerobic fermentors. 
Table 3.5 compares the fermentor performance when fed once daily or 22 times 
per day. At a HRT of 5 days and similar influent YS concentration, the CH4 
production rate was about 10% higher when the fermentor was fed 22 times per 
day compared to being fed once per day. The lower CH4 production rate at once 
per day feed; ng may have resul ted from the dai ly shock loadi ng of the 
fermentor, especially at the short HRT of 5 days. Figure 3.5 and 3.6 show the 
variation in TVA, and percent CH4 and C02, respectively, with time after 
feeding when the fermentor was operated at 55°C andHRT of 12 days. There was 
a 250% increase in TVA 2 hr after feeding, then a gradual decrease in TVA. 
The CH4 concentration decreased to about 46% 4 hr after feeding, increased to 
66% 14 hr after feeding, and remained at that concentration for the rest of 
the day. Figure 3.7 shows the change in hourly total gas and CH4 production 
rate with time after feeding. The hourly total gas production rate was 7 
times higher and the CH4 production rate was 6 times higher 1 hr after feeding 
compared to 22 hr after feeding. Since the results shown in Figures 3.5 to 
3.7 were for the fermentor operated at 12 days HRT and loading rate of 5.2 kg 
. YS/m3'day, we ex~ect that the magnitude of a daily shock loading at 5 days HRT 
and 16.5 kg VS/m 'day loading rate would be much greater, and this shock 
loading may be the reason for the lower CH4 production rate for the daily fed 
operation compared to the 22 hr/day feeding. 
3.3.3 Comparison of Experimental to Predicted CH4 Production Rates 
One of the major reasons for operating the pilot-scale fermentor was to obtain 
data that could be used to design full-scale systems. 
In the design and scale-up of the fermentation systems, it is important to be 
able to predict the performance of the fermentor under different operating 
conditions in order to optimize the systems. Equation 2.1 was used to predict 
the CH4 production rate (Yy) of the fermentor. Figure 2.2 was used to esti­
mate ~m at 50 and 55°C and Figure 2.3 was used to estimate K. Since Figure 
2.3 has relationships between K and So only at 32.5 and 60°C, the values for K 
at 50 and 55°C were assumed to vary as they do at 60°C (this assumption seems 
to be valid based on preliminary results from our laboratory). The value of 
Bo was assumed to be 0.35 L CH4/9 YSf' since long-term (114 to 186 day) batch 
fermentations of the fermentor influent yielded Bo ranging from 0.32 to 0.40 L 
CH4/9 YSf·

3.4 SUMMARY 
This Section summarizes the start-up and steady-state operation of the 
pilot-scale, thermophilic, anaerobic fermentor. The fermentor was operated 
at: temperatures of 45, 50 and 55°C; hydraulic retention times ranging from 
12 to 4 days; mixed continuously or 2 hr/day; and fed 1 or 22 times/day. No 
difference in CH4production rate was observed when the fermentor was mixed 2 
hr/day versus continuously. The CH4 production rate was about 10% higher when 
the fermentor was fed 22 times/day as compared with once/day. The highest CH4 
production rate achieved by the fermentor was 4.7 L CH4/L fermentor·day. This 
was the highest rate reported in the literature and about four times higher 
than other pilot-or full-scale systems fermenting livestock manure. 33

ENERGY REQUIREMENTS FOR ANAEROBIC FERMENTATION SYSTEMS 
Y. R. Chen and A. G. Hashimoto 
4.1 INTRODUCTION 
This section discusses the power and energy requirements for m1x1ng, pumping, 
and heati ng the i nfl uent sl urry and fermentor 1 i quor. Th; s di-scussi on is 
necessary in order to maximize the net energy production of anaerobic fermen­
tation systems. 
4.2 ENERGY AND POWER REQUIREMENTS 
4.2.1 Heating Requirement 
The total heat required to maintain the fermentor liquor at a desired tem­
perature can be expressed as follows: 
QT = Qf + Qw + Qg + Oi -Or (4.1) 
where: OT = total fermentor heat requirement, J/day; 
Of = heat loss through fermentor walls, floor and top, J/day; 
Ow = heat loss due to evaporation, J/day; 
Qg = heat loss due to the gas leaving fermentor, J/day; 
O' = heat required to rai se the influent slurry to the desired -1 
fermentor temperature, J/day; and 
Or = heat of reaction from methane fermentation, J/day. 
The heat loss through the fermentor wall s (Of) is the sum of the heat loss 
through the top, side walls, and bottom of the fermentor, which can be calcu­
lated from the overall heat transfer coefficients of top, side walls and bot­
tom of the fermentor. 
The heat loss due to evaporated water (Ow) is the sum of the sensible heat 
loss of the steam and the heat of evaporation of water. The sensible heat 
loss with the dry biogas leaving the fermentor (Og) is the sum of the sensible 
heat in CH4 and C02' Ashare et ala (1978) have dlscussed in detail the calcu­
lation of Og and Ow' 
The heat required to raise the influent slurry to the fermentor operating tem­
perature can be calculated from: 
Qi = W Cp (t -ts) (4.2) 
where t is the fermentation temperature (OC), ts is the influent slurry tem­
perature (OC), H is the total weight of slurry to be added to the fermentor 34 
per day, and CQ is the specific heat of the influent slurry. The specific 
heat of the influent slurry depends on its total solids concentration. We 
have calculated the specific heat of beef cattle manure slurry to be: 
Cp = 4.17 [1 -0.00812 (TS)J (4.3) 
where Cp is in KJ/Kg'oC and TS is the total solids concentration in %. 
Pirt (1978) suggested that in an anaerobic process, 3% of the available heat 
is liberated in the reaction. However, using our experimental data from 6 
days HRT and a volatile solids loading rate of 15 kg/m3'day, we found that 102 
MJ/m3'fermentor'day of heat energy was available from the influent fed to the 
5.1 m3 fermentor. The fermentor, however, produced 122 moles of CH4/ 
m3'fermentor'day, which contained a heat energy of 107.7 MJ/m3·fermentoroday. 
Since the heat energy in the CH4 is essentially equal to the substrate heat 
energy, we concluded that the heat of reaction (Or) was negligible. 
In the following calculations, fermentors with total working volume up to 785 
m3 were assumed to have worki ng tank hei ght to di ameter rati os of 1. 0, thu s 
limiting tank height to 10 m. Tanks larger than 785 m3 were designed with a 
maximum tank height of 10 m and sufficient diameter to accomodate the volume. 
The maximum tank diameter was assumed to be 80 m, resulting in a maximum tank 
volume of 5027 m3. Systems requiring volumes greater than 5027 m3 were 
designed with multiple tanks. The top, sides, and bottom of each fermentor 
were assumed to be insulated with materials having an overall heat transfer 
coefficient of 2.04 KJ/h·m2.oC. 
Table 4.1 gives the thermal energy requirements for fermentation systems 
operating at 55°C, 5 days HRT and 80 g VS/L influent concentration along with 
their gross methane energy production. Using B = 0.35 L CH4/g VS for beef 
cattle manure, maximum specific growth rate (~m9 of 0.586 day-l (for 55°C) and 
kinetic parameter (K) of 0.8, the volumetric methane production rate (rV) of 
3.96 mj CH4/m3'fermentor'day is obtained (Hashimoto et al., 1980). 
Table 4.1 shows that for plant sizes ranging from 1 to 1,000 ~1g TS/day, Of 
increases from 0.186 to 36.2 GJ/day; Ow + 08 increases from 0.089 to 89.0 
GJ/day; and Oi increases from 1.910 to 1,91 GJ/day. The total heat energy 
requirement, however, decreases from 39.7% to 37.0% of the gross methane 
energy production, assuming a boiler efficiency of 70% and an ambient tem­
perature of 10°C. Of the total heating requirement, 87.4% to 93.9% is for 
heating the influent, while heat loss through the fermentor walls accounts for 
1.8% to 8.5% of the total heat requirement. The percent of heat required to 
compensate for the surface heat loss varies inversely with the size of the 
fermentor. 
The net thermal energy production, i.e., the amount of CH4 energy production 
minus heat energy requirement, ranges from 4.73 GJ/day for the 1 Mg TS/day 
plant to 4,950 GJ/day for the 1,000 ~lg TS/day plant. 
4.2.2 Pumping Power and Energy Requirements 
The rheological properties of the slurry being pumped and mixed have a direct 
influence on the power requirements. Livestock waste slurries and fermentor 
liquor generally display non-Newtonian, pseudoplastic behavior. We previously 
used a power-law formula to describe the relationship between shear stress (T) TABLE 4.1. HEATING ENERGY REQUIREMENTS AND NET THERtvlAL ENERGY

and shear rate (y) (Chen and Hashimoto, 1976,1979): 
-K,n L -Y (4.4) 
where K is rheological consistency index in Pa'sn and n is rheological beha­
vior index. The K and n of beef cattle manure slurries at different total 
solids concentration have been reported earlier (Chen and Hashimoto, 1979). 
The method of calculating the pumping power requirement for a pseudoplastic 
slurry was described previously (Chen and Hashimoto, 1976). He have found 
that the onset of turbulence in pumping livestock waste slurry was delayed 
until the General i zed Reynol ds number (NRe I) for 1 i vestock waste sl urry was 
over 3,100. The Generalized Reynolds number is defined by: 
(4.5) 
where P = slurry density, kg/m3; 
o = pipe diameter, m; 
v = slurry flow speed, m/sec/ 
To prevent solid particles from settling in the pipe and to have better heat 
transfer characteristics when a heat exchanger is used to recover effluent 
heat, the piping should be designed to maintain turbulent flow (NRe > 4,300)' 
In our calculation, however, the pipe size is chosen so that the NRel is close 
to but does not exceed 5,000, and the pipe size is no smaller than 0.0191 mID. 
Table 4.2 lists the pipe diameter, pumping rate, number of pumps and the total 
influent and effluent volume to be pumped. The plants were assumed to operate 
at 5 days HRT and 80 g VS/L influent concentration (9.4% T5 concentration). 
The effective pumping length was assumed to be 300 m, which does not include 
the pressure head due to the liquid height of the above-ground tank. The same 
pump used to pump the i nfl uent was al so used to pump the effl uent. Effl uent 
pumpi ng was not necessary for the 1000 r,1g TS/d pl ant because there was suf­
ficient head to use gravity flow. 
The rheological properties were assumed to be: K = 0.61 Pa·sn and n = 0.54 
for the 10% T5 influent; and K = 0.33 Pa'sn and n = 0.5 for the 5% TS 
effluent. 
Table 4.2 shows that the power required to pump the influent is 0.70 kW for 
the 1 Mg T5/day plant and 95.4 kW for the 1,000 Mg T5/day plant. The power 
requirement per unit volume of slurry pumped decreases from 65.8 W/m3 for the 
1 Mg T5/day plant to 8.97 H/m3 for the 1,000 Mg TS/day plant. Because of the 
low viscosity of the fermentor liquor and use of gravity flow in the large 
plant, the power required to pump the effluent ranged from 3.55 to 0 kW for 
plants ranging from 1 to 1,000 ~1g TS/day. The total energy required to pump 
the influent and effluent increased from 0.0345 GJ/day for the 1 Mg TS/day 
plant to 3.44 GJ/day for the 1,000 ~lg TS/day plant.

effluent is shortened to 3 hr/day, the pipe size and power requirement will 
increase. Pumping the influent requires 2.10 kH for the 1 t~g TS/day plant and 
33.0 kW for the 1,000 Mg TS/day plant. However, the total energy consumption 
remains about the same for the 1 and 10 Mg TS/day plants, and there is a 17% 
to 20% reduction in energy consumption for the 100 and 1,000 t'1g TS/day plants, 
respectively, because much larger pipes are used for 3 hr pumping compared to 
pumping 10 hr per day. 
4.2.3 Mixing Power Requirement 
The pilot-scale fermentor liquor (at about 5% TS) and the influent slurry (at 
about 12% TS) were agitated by mixers equipped with dual, 3-blade marine 
propell ers. Adequate agitati on was achi eved at rotati onal speeds of 140 rpm 
for the fermentor liquor and 316 rpm for the influent slurry. 
The net power consumption was estimated from the plots of power number (Np) 
and Reynolds number (NRe) for mixing beef cattle manure (Chen and Hashimoto, 
1979). The net power consumption for mixing the fermentor liquor was 86.7 W 
for one propeller and 156.2 W for dual propellers, using a factor of 1.8 for 
dual propellers (Bates et a1., 1966). This gives a net power consumptiDn per 
volume of 28.8 W/m3. 
The net power consumpti on for mi xi ng the i nfl uent sl ~rry was esti mated usi ng 
the same procedure, and was calculated to be 152 W/m for single propeller and 
213 W/m3 for dual propellers. A factor of 1.4 for dual propellers is used 
because the separation of these two propellers is only one propeller diameter 
(Bates et al., 1966). 
To maintain the same quality of mixing in large scale fermentation systems, 
the power consumption per unit volume should be preserved (Johnstone and 
Thri ng, 1957). 
Table 4.4 shows the pov,er and energy requirement for mixing fermentor liquor 
and i nf1 uent sl urry for different pl ant si zes. I;Jith conti nuous mi xi ng, the 
fermentor mixing energy requirement increased from 0.222 to 222.0 GJ/day for 
plant sizes ranging from 1 to 1,000 Mg TS/day. For mixing the influent 
slurry, the power and energy requirement are 48% higher than those for the 
fermentor liquor. 
4.3 DISCUSSION 
4.3.1 Comparing Energy Requirements 
Table 4.5 summarizes the energy requirements for systems fermenting beef 
cattle manure operating at 55°C,S days HRT, and 80 g VS/L influent 
concentration. The energy requirements for C02 scrubbing and CH4 compression 
are also listed in Table 4.5. Ashare et al. (1978) concluded that the water 
scrubbing of C02 is the simplest and cheapest way to clean the biogas.The 
power requ i red was es ti mated to be 5.88 vJ /m3 / day of the bi ogas flow rate. The 
net power required to compress the methane gas from 101.3 kPa (1 atmosphere) 
to 861 kPa (8.5 atmosphere) was used. Assuming an ideal gas and adiabatic 
process, the total power required to compress the CH4 is 4.94 vl/m3/day (Perry 
and Chilton, 1973) with a compressor efficiency of 70%.

comprises the major portion of the total energy consumption, ranging from 
39.7% to 37.0% at an assumed ambient temperature of 10°C. Of this heating 
energy requirement, 87.4% to 93.9% is used to heat the influent slurry. This 
indicates the absolute necessity of recovering the effluent heat energy for 
heating the influent. The heating energy requirement is reduced from 37.0% to 
19.7% of the gross energy production for a 1,000 Mg TS/day plant if 50% of the 
effluent heat is recovered. 
The next major energy consumption is mlxlng. It amounts to 7.3% of the total 
CH4 energy production. Our laboratory and pilot studies showed that the CH4 
production did not vary with the duration of daily mixing of the fermentor 
liquor, indicating that the minimum mixing requirement for fermentation 
systems may be based on the slurry and effluent handling aspects. The energy 
consumption of mixing can be cut at· least one half by reducing the mixing 
time. 
The least energy is consumed in pumping. Pumping energy depends less on the 
plant size because larger pipes can be used for handling larger volumes of the 
slurry. Energy consumed per volume pumped decreases as pipe size increases. 
Three hours pumping has higher Reynolds number but requires larger pumps and 
pipes than 10 hours pumping and therefore involves higher capital cost (Tables 
4.2 and 4.3). 
The total energy consumption, including C02 scrubbing and CH4 compression, but 
excluding heating energy, accounts for 11.3% of the gross CH4 energy produc­
tion for the 1 Mg TS/day plant and 10.8% for the 1,000 Mg TS/day plant. 
4.3.2 Effect of Influent Concentration on Net Thermal Energy Production 
Equation 2.1 and Figures 2.2 and 2.3 were used to calculate the gross CH4 
production from which the heating requirement was subtracted to determine the 
net thermal energy production. In calculating the CH4 production at 55°C, m 
of 0.586 day-1 and K = 0.6, 0.65, 0.8, and 1.3 for So = 60, 70, 80, and 100 g 
VS/L, respectively, were used. Figure 4.1 shows that at long HRT, higher 
influent concentration will produce more net thermal energy for the same plant 
size. However, at HRT less than 12 days, the net thermal energy production 
increases with So only if So is less than 80 g VS/L. As So increases to 100 g 
VS/L, the net thermal energy production has a decreases sharply. 
4.3.3 Net Thermal Energy Production of tvlesophilic and Thermophilic Systems 
Figure 4.2 compares the net thermal energy production from systems fermenting 
beef cattle manure at mesophilic (35°C) and thermophilic (55°C) temperatures 
with an influent concentration of 80 g VS/L. At 35°C and So = 80 g VS/L, ~m = 
0.326 day-1 and K = 1.7 were used. 
Figure 4.2 shows that, at long HRT, mesophilic systems may produce more net 
thermal energy than thermophil ic systems, but at short HRT, thermophil ic 
systems wi 11 produce more. The advantage of thermophil i cover mesophil i c 
systems will increase if the effluent heat is recovered for influent slurry 
heating.

systems. The major energy consumption for a thermophilic system is in main­
taining the fermentor temperature. Of the total heating energy required, 
about 89 to 94% was for heating the influent slurry at an ambient temperature 
of 10°C. The need to recover the heat leaving with the effluent is apparent. 
With 50% effluent heat recovery, the heating energy requirement is reduced 
from 37.0% to 19.7% of the gross energy production for a 1,000 Mg TS/day 
plant. 
The next major energy consumption was due to the mlxlng of the influent slurry 
and fermentor liquor. Mixing amounted to 7.3% of the gross methane energy 
production, assuming continuous mixing. The mixing energy can be reduced 
greatly if the mixing time is reduced. 
The least energy was consumed in pumping. Pumping energy did not increase 
when the pumping time was shortened from 10 to 3 hours. Three hours of 
pumping has a higher Reynolds number but requires a larger pump and bigger 
pipes. 
The total energy consumption excluding thermal energy consumption accounts 
10.8 to 11.3% of the gross thermal energy production. 
Using the kinetic constants given for different influent concentration and 
fermentation temperature, it was found that for HRT less than 12 days, the net 
thermal energy production increased with the influent concentration up to 80 g 
VS/L and began to drop at influent concentration greater than 80 g VS/L. 
Also, a longer HRT will produce more net thermal energy at the same influent 
concentration. 
The net thermal energy production for 35° and 55°C were also compared for an 
influent concentration of 80 g VS/L. This comparison showed that a ther­
mophilic (55°C) system will produce more thermal energy than a mesophilic 
(35°) system unless the fermenter is operated at a very long HRT. 46 
SECTION 5.0 
ECONOMIC OPTIMIZATION OF ANAEROB IC FERMENTOR DESIGNS 
A. G. Hashimoto and Y. R. Chen , 
5.1 INTRODUCTION 
It is apparent from this report and reports published elsewhere that producing 
methane (CH4) from livestock manures is technically, and sometimes economi­
cally, feasible. The maximum amount of CH4 per unit weight of substrate is 
obtained at long hydraulic retention times (HRT); however, long HRT require 
very large fermentor volumes and high capital costs. This section presents 
our approach to optimizing fermentor designs, based on maximizing the net 
energy production per unit fermentor cost. 
5.2 OPTIMIZED DESIGNS 
5.2.1 Capital Cost 
Figure 5.1 shows the capital cost for various anaerobic fermentation systems 
plotted against the fermentor volume (Ashare et al., 1977; Burford et al., 
1977; Coppinger et al., 1979; Fischer 'et al., 1978; Hashimoto and Chen, 1979; 
and Hayes et al., 1979). The capital cost included all equipment and facil,ity 
costs for the fermentation system (including installation labor), except costs 
for effluent treatment or storage (e.g., centrifugation, filtration, 
lagooning) and biogas handling or use (e.g., C02 scrubbing and electrical 
generation). 
Several important relationships should be noted from Figure 5.1. For fermen­
tors larger than 100 m3, there are two apparent cost-volume relationships 
(high and low capital costs), and both relationships show that capital cost 
increases with volume to the 0.7 power. Also, the high capital cost systems 
cost three times more than the low capital cost systems, and the capital costs 
for the plug-flow systems, reported by Hayes et al. (1979), resembles that for 
the same si ze conventi onal fermentor. The hi gh capi tal cost systems represent 
"turn-keyll systems that are desi gned, constructed and started-up by pri vate 
contracting firms. The low capital cost systems represent farmer-contracted 
systems with partial construction labor provided by farm personnel. 
5.2.2 ~Jet Energy Production Per Unit Cost 
The method we selected to optimize the design of anaerobic fermentation 
systems is to maximize the net thermal energy production per unit of capital 
cost. vie cal cul ated the gross energy producti on by usi ng the ki neti c equati on 
and parameters presented in Section 2.0. The net thermal energy production 
was calculated by subtracting the heating requirements of the system from the 
gross energy production as described in Section 3.0. 
Si nce the cost of the fermentation system is rel ated to the fermentor vol ume 
,to the 0.7 power (Figure 5.1), the net thermal energy production per unit of 
relative capital cost (NEPC) was calculated as follows: -W-106

Thus, the design conditions \vould be optimum when NEPC is maximum. (5.1 ) 
Figure 5.2 presents plots of NEPC versus HRT at different temperatures (35° and 
55°C) and different influent volatile solids (VS) concentrations (50, 60, 70, 
80, 90, and 100 g VS/l), assuming that the ambient and influent temperatures 
are 10°C and that 50% of the effluent heat is recovered. Figure 5.2 shows that 
the design conditions are optimum at 55°C, with HRT between 4 and 5 days and 
influent concentrations between 80 and 100 g VS/l. Under these conditions, 
the thermophilic system had about twice the NEPC of the mesophilic systems. 
5. 3 ECONO~lICS 
5.3.1 System Design 
Using the optimum design conditions determined in the preceeding subsection, 
Y./e made an economi c assessment to determi ne the economic feas i bi 1 i ty of us; ng 
anaerobic fermentation systems in beef cattle enterprises. Beef cattle enter­
prises were selected because more information is available on the kinetic 
parameters of cattle manure fermentation systems than other livestock manures 
(Section 2.0), and because we have experience in operating a pilot-scale (5 m3) 
thermophilic, anaerobic fermentor close to these optimum desi~n conditions 
(Section 3.0). Based on the discussion in Section 3.0, we used the following 
kinetic parameters: Pm = 0.586 day-1 at 55°C and K = 1.0 at an influent con­
centration of 90 9 VS/l. These kinetic parameters yield a CH4 production rate 
of 4.15 l CH4/l fermentor'day assuming a 80 of 0.35 l CH4/9 VS. This CH4 pro­
duction rate is achievable since we have obtained a rate of 4.7 l CH4/l 
fermentor'day in our pilot-scale fermentor. We assumed a CH4 concentration of 
55% in the biogas. 
In the proposed fermentation system, manure from a confinement feedlot is 
scraped into a mi xi ng tank where water is added to produce a sl urry of 90 g 
VS/l (assuming VS = 85% of TS). The mixing tank is equipped with a mechanical 
mixer, degritting mechanism, qnd piping to heat the slurry to the desired tem­
perature. The slurry is then pumped to the fermentor, which is mixed for 12 
hr/day. The effluent is pumped through the piping in the mixing tank to 
recover about 50% of the heat. The effluent is then incorporated with other 
ration ingredients and fed back to the cattle. Supplemental heating of the 
i nfl uent is provi ded by a hot y./ater heat-exchanger. Operati on of the enti re 
system is controlled by a microprocessor-controller. 
We evaluated several options for biogas handling (with and without C02 removal) 
and use (heat or electricity) in this assessment, as follows:

For all of these options, H2S and moisture are removed from the biogas by the 
iron sponge and glycol absorption processes, and the gas is compressed and 
stored at 860 kPa in tanks with a l-day gas-production capacity. These pro­
cesses are necessary to prevent corrosion and to allow some flexibility to 
modulate the variation in daily gas production. The C02 is removed by the 
water-stripping pro~ess. 
Table 5.1 summarizes the fermentor volume, energy requirements, and net energy 
production for the various options and plant sizes. Procedures used to calcu-
1 ate the vol ume and number of fermentors and energy requi rements are presented 
in Section 4.0. 
Since the efficiency of an internal combustion engine to convert CH4 into use­
ful work increases as the engine size increases, the engine-generator effi­
ciency 'v-/as estimated by the following equation (assuming a 95% efficient 
generator and engine efficiencies published by Evans et al., 1973): 
Engine-generator efficiency (%) = 4.18 1n (E) + 11.61 (5.2) 
where E is the gross energy input to the engine (GJ/day) and the maximum effi­
ciency is 38%. Equation 5.2 i~ only applicable for engines fueled with 100% 
CH4; therefore, Equation 5.2 is applicable only for Option D. The engine­
generator efficiencies for Option C were assumed to be 60% of that calculated 
from Equation 5.2, since the useful work output per unit energy input of a 
high compression engine, receiving gas containing 55% CH4, is 60% of an engine 
receiving 100% CH4 (Neyeloff and Gunkel, 1975). 
The net CH4 production, shown in Table 5.1, was calculated by subtracting the 
net heating requirement from the gross energy production. The net electrical 
production was calculated by subtracting the electrical energy requirements 
from the electrical energy produced by the engine-generator. Option 0 pro­
duced more net electrical energy than Option C because the higher engine­
generator efficiency of Option 0 was sufficient to offset the increased energy 
for C02 removal. 
We assumed that the waste heat from the engine would be used to heat the 
fermentor. This assumption is justified since the net heating requirement is 
only about 20% of the total energy production, and between 20 to 30% of the 
gross energy consumed by the engine can be recovered from the jacket cooling 
system. Since an additional 26 to 30% of the heat can be recovered from the 
engine exhaust, Options C and 0 can be a source of low temperature (75 to 
85°C) process It/ater, as well as electricity. We did not assume any use of the 
excess waste heat from the engine generator in our energy balance, nor did we 
assess any credit for the excess heat generated.

aLow cost option assumes labor and fixed costs to be 25% and 33%, respectively, 
of high cost option. 54 
Figure 5.1, was used. Table 5.3 shows the total capital costs for the various 
options and plant sizes. 
5.3.3 Annual Costs 
Annual costs (labor, fixed and utility costs) were estimated fo~ the various 
plant sizes (Table 5.3). Salaries for the plant operators were assumed to 
range from $ll,OOO/yr for the 1 Mg TS/day plant up to $43,OOO/yr for the 100 
Mg TS/day plant. 
Fixed costs were calculated assuming an interest rate of 14% and a 20-year 
straight-line depreciation of the total capital cost. Taxes, insurance, and 
repair and maintenance were estimated to be 3, 1.5 and 3% of the installed 
equipment cost, respectively. 
Utility costs were calculated based upon the energy requirements in excess of 
that produced. Utility rates were assumed to be $14/GJ (5\1/kv/h) for electri­
city and $0.11/m3 for make-up water. The utility costs shown for Options A 
and 8 reflect electricity and water charges. The only utility cost charged to 
Opt; cins C and 0 was for make-up water, si nee the engi ne-generator produced 
more el ectri city and waste heat than needed by the fermentati on system. 
Table 5.3 also shows the total annual costs for the low cost, farmer­
contracted and operated systems. The capital costs for these systems were 
assumed to be one-third the cost of a comparably sized, "turn-key" plant 
(Figure 5.1). The labor costs were assumed to be one-quarter of the high cost 
system. This low level of labor can be justified because of the use of 
microprocessor-controllers to operate and monitor much of the routine 
operation. 
5.3.4 Energy Production Costs 
Energy production costs were calculated by dividing the total annual cost for 
each opti on by the annual net energy (CH4 or el ectri city) produced by each 
option. The effect of plant size on CH4 production costs for the high cost 
systems (Options A and 8) and the low-cost systems (Options AI and 81
) are 
shown in Figure 5.3. The plant size at which CH4 production costs equal the 
current natural gas prices of $3/GJ would be 75, greater than 300, 4.2 and 6.7 
Mg TS/day for Options A, 8, AI and 81
, respectively. Thus, although there is 
only about a three-fold difference in total annual cost between Option A and 
AI, there is about an 18-fold difference in break-even plant size. 
Fi gure 5.4 shows the effect of plant si ze on el ectri ci ty producti on costs. 
The plant sizes at which the electricity production costs equal the current 
electricity rate of $14/GJ (5\1/kWh) would be 43, 22, 5.3 and 2.8 Mg TS/day for 
Options C, 0, CI and 01
, respectively. These results show that there is an 
eight-fold difference in break-even plant size between the low-cost and high­
cost systems, and that the increased electricity generation efficiency, caused 
by scrubbing C02 from the biogas (Options 0 and 01), more than compensates for 
the increased total annual costs. 
Table 5.4 lists the energy production costs for the various options at dif­
ferent plant sizes (1, 10 and 100 Mg TS/day) and an effluent feed credit of 
S60/Mg effluent TS. The production costs with effluent feed credit were 
calculated by subtracting the feed credit from the total annual cost and by J

dividing the difference by the annual net energy production. The results in 
Table 5.4 indicate that the break-even plant sizes are decreased to between 3 
and 8 Mg TS/day for the high cost systems when the effluent feed credit is 
used. For the low cost systems, the break-even plant size is less than 1 ~~g 
TS/day when the effluent feed credit ;s used. 
5.3.5 Implications of this Assessment 
This economic assessment has shown that CH4 can be economically generated at 
moderate plant sizes (3 to 6 Mg TS/day) when farmer-constructed and operated 
systems are used or when "turn-key" systems use an effl uent feed credit of 
$60/~1g effluent TS. Assuming that 2.8 kg TS/day can be recovered from a con­
fined steer, the break-even plant size discussed above would serve feedlots 
between 1,000 to 2,000 cattle. If the farmer-constructed and operated systems 
also fed the fermentor effluent, then anaerobic fermentation systems would be 
economically feasible for feedlots of less than 300 cattle. 
In this assessment, we assumed that all of the energy produced would be used. 
Lipper et al. (1976) reported that the energy requirements for energy-intensive 
commercial feedlots in Kansas were 2.2 GJ/head'yr for natural gas and 0.32 
GJ/head'yr for electricity. The net energy production from a plant receiving 
manure from a 1,000-head feedlot would be about 6.2 GJ/head'yr of CH4 (Options 
A and B) or 0.9 (Option C) and 1.6 GJ/head"yr (Option D) of electricity. 
Thus, more energy would be produced by these systems than could be used by the 
livestock enterprise. Strategies must be developed to utilize this excess 
energy. Conscientious effort must be exercised to adjust energy use to pro­
ducti on at the enterpri se level, and there must be the opportuni ty to sell the 
surplus energy. 
5. 4 SU~1MAR Y 
We have presented our approach to optimizing anaerobic fermenter designs by 
selecting design criteria that maximize the net energy production per unit 
cost. Using this optimization technique, we estimate that a farmer-constructed 
and operated system would be economically feasible for beef feedlots between 
1,000 to 2,000 head without an effluent feed credit, and about 300 head with 
an effl uent feed credi t of $60/~1g eff1 uent TS. Commerci a 1 "tu rn-key" systems 
are only feasible for feedlots larger than 8,000 head when an effluent credit 
is not used, and for feedlots between 1,000 to 2,000 head when an effluent 
feed credit of $60/Mg effluent TS is used. Based on these results, we believe 
that the economics of anaerobic fermentation is sufficiently favorable for 
farm-scale application of this technology. 59

16. Abstract (Limit: 200 words) This report summarizes the research to convert livestock manure 
and crop residues into methane and a high protein feed ingredient by thermophilic 
anaerobic fermentation. The major biological and operational factors involved in 
methanogenesis were discussed, and a kinetic model that describes the fermentation 
process was presented. Substrate biodegradability, fermentation temperature, and 
influent substrate concentration were shown to have significant effects on CH4 pro­
duction rate. The kinetic model predicted methane production rates of existing 
pilot and full-scale fermentation systems to within 15%. The highest methane pro­
duction rate achieved by the fermenter was 4.7 L CH4/L fermenter day. This is the I 
highest rate reported in the literature and· about 4 times higher than other pilot 
or full-scale systems fermenting livestock manures. Assessment of the energy re­
quirements for anaerobic fermentation systems showed that the major energy re­
quirement for a thermophilic system \Vas for maintaining the fermenter temperature. 
The next major energy consumption was due to the mixing of the influent slurry and 
fermenter liquor. An approach to optimizing anaerobic fermenter designs by select­
ing design criteria that maximize the net energy production per unit cost was pre­
sented. Based on the results, we believe that the economics of anaerobic fermenta­
tion is sufficiently favorable for farm-scale demonstration of this technology.
