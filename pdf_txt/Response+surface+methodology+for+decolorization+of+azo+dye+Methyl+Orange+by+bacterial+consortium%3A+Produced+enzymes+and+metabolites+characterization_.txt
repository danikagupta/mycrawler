The use of chemometric methods such as response surface methodology (RSM) based on statistical
design of experiments (DOEs) is becoming increasingly widespread in several sciences such as analyticalchemistry, engineering and environmental chemistry. In the present study, the decolorization and thedegradation efﬁciency of Methyl Orange (MO) was studied using a microbial consortium. The microbialgrowth of Sphingomonas paucimobilis ,Bacillus cereus ATCC14579, Bacillus cereus ATCC11778 is well in
the presence of MO (750 ppm) within 48 h at pH 7 and 30
◦C. In fact, these microorganisms were able
to decolorize and to degrade MO to 92%. The degradation pathway and the metabolic products formedduring the degradation were also predicted using UV–vis, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopyand nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy analysis. Under optimal conditions, the bacterialconsortium was able to decolorize completely (>84%) the dye within 48 h. The color and COD removalwere 84.83% and 92.22%, respectively. A signiﬁcant increase in azoreductase, lignin peroxidase and lac-case activities in the cells were obtained after complete decolorization. Phytotoxicity study using plantsshowed no toxicity of the produced products.

1. Introduction
The textile industry wastewater is rated as the most polluting
among all industrial sectors in terms of both volume and composi-tion of the efﬂuents [1,2] . The color in these discharged wastewater
is due to synthetic dyes left unused due to industrial inefﬁciencies.Presently over 10,000 different dyes and pigments are used in dye-ing and printing industries all over the world. Many of them arebelieved to be toxic and carcinogenic [3].
Almost 7 ×10
5tones of dyes are produced around the world
every year, and most of them are azo dyes containing one or moreazo groups (R1–N
N–R2), which are extensively used as industrial
raw materials [4]. It is quite undesirable to discharge azo dyes with
different color into the environment due to their higher pollutionand toxic intermediates produced [5]. Compared with chemical and

for the degradation of these dyes, which can produce lower costsand fewer toxic resultants [6,7] . Many microorganisms, belonging
to bacteria, fungi, even yeasts proved their ability to decolorize azodyes by bioadsorption or degradation. Among these microorgan-isms, bacteria and fungi which played a key roles in the treatmentof wastewater containing dyes, and it has been proved that can theydecolorize dyes with different types of enzymes [8].
Recently, azoreductase activity was detected in many bacteria,
such as Sphingomonas xenophaga BN6, Pigmentiphaga kullae K24
and Caulobacter subvibrioides C7-D [9–11] . There is a little appli-
cation for practical treatment although many pure cultures areavailable to decolorize azo dyes, which can be supported by threereasons [12] . Firstly, fungi cannot use azo dyes as sole carbon and
energy source, and their growth is time consuming. Secondly, lowefﬁciency of bacteria degrading azo dyes is achieved under aerobicconditions, because oxygen is a more efﬁcient electron acceptorcompared with azo dye. Thirdly, single strains cannot adapt thecomplex and variable environment conditions. Therefore, mixedmicrobial populations are expected to perform better than singlemicroorganisms [13] . However, there is a little information about
using fungal–bacterial consortium to decolorize azo dyes.

Statistical optimization method (a central composite design
coupled with response surface methodology (RSM)) overcomes thelimitations of classical methods and was successfully employedto obtain the optimum process conditions while the interactionsbetween process variables were demonstrated [14] .
The importance and theoretical concepts behind the optimiza-
tion through experimental design as well as RSM in research anddevelopment efforts have been thoroughly discussed in a numberof informative articles and the sequential steps of RSM are alsohighlighted in subsequent sections of this study. RSM is nowadays,a promising as well as a powerful tool for multivariate optimiza-tion through sequential experimentation. Several researchers havealready been using various RSM approaches to explain optimizationprocess [15] .
The present work aims to study the ability of Sphin-
gomonas paucimobilis ,Bacillus cereus ATCC14579 and Bacillus cereus
ATCC11778 to decolorize MO. However, the selection of optimalconditions for the growth and the different proportions of the threemicroorganisms using the response surface methodology can ame-liorate the decolorization performances of the cells for MO. Theproduced metabolites during the degradation were also predictedusing UV–vis FTIR spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) spectroscopy analysis. These metabolites were studied fortheir toxicity using the plants phytotoxicity.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Dye and chemicals
The commercially used textile azo dye Methyl Orange
(C
14H14N3NaO 3S, E.C. No. 2089253; /NAKmax = 466 nm) was purchased
from the Sigma–Aldrich (Chemical Company, MO, USA) and usedfor the study without any further puriﬁcation.
Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), 2,2
/prime-
azinobis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline)-6-sulfonate (ABTS) and methylsulfoxide- d6, 99.9 at% D (contains 0.03% v/v TMS) (DMSO d6) were
purchased from Sigma–Aldrich Chemicals, USA. Sodium phosphatebuffer (PBS), tartaric acid, acetate buffer and n-propanol were pur-chased from Biorad, USA. All chemicals used were of the highestpurity available and of analytical grade.
2.2. Microorganisms and culture media
Three microorganisms, S. paucimobilis , Bacillus cereus
ATCC14579, Bacillus cereus ATCC11778 were used in this study. S.
paucimobilis was isolated in previous works of Ayed et al. [16,17]
with the ability of degrading azo and triphenylmethane dyes(Congo Red, Methyl Red, Malachite Green and Crystal Violet).Bacillus cereus ATCC14579 and Bacillus cereus ATCC11778 are a
reference strains. The used medium was composed in 1000 ml ofdistilled water: glucose (1250 mg/L), yeast extract (3000 mg/L),MgSO
4(100 mg/L); (NH 4)2SO 4(600 mg/L); NaCl (500 mg/L);K2HPO 4(1360 mg/L); CaCl 2(20 mg/L); MnSO 4(1.1 mg/L); ZnSO 4
(0.2 mg/L); CuSO 4(0.2 mg/L); FeSO 4(0.14 mg/L) and it was main-
tained at a constant pH of 7 by the addition phosphate buffer[16,17] .
2.3. Experimental design and methods
The D-optional method in the experimental design, provided by
the software Minitab (Ver. 14.0, U.S. Federal Government Common-wealth of Pennsylvania, USA), was used to optimize the formulationof the microbial consortium. Generally, the mixture design wasused to study the relationships between the proportion of differentvariables and responses. Ever since Scheffe devised a single-latticeand single-core design in 1958, the mixture design has developeda variety of methods [18,19] .
Response surface methodology (RSM) is usually applied fol-
lowing a screening study to explore the region of interest of thefactors identiﬁed by the preceding study [15] . The mixture design
is widely used in the formulation of food experiment, chemicals,fertilizer, pesticides, and other products. It can estimate the rela-tionship between formulation and performance through regressionanalysis in fewer experiment times [20] .
In this study, S. paucimobilis ,Bacillus cereus ATCC14579 and
Bacillus cereus ATCC11778 were used as mixture starters, with dif-
ferent proportions ranging from 0 to 100%, as shown in Table 1 .
Decolorization experiments were taken according to the ratio givenby the experimental design, and 10% of mixed culture were inoc-ulated into the Mineral Salt Medium (MSM) (3.0 g/L yeast extractand 1.25 g/L glucose and 750 ppm MO) at 37
◦C for 10 h in shaking
conditions (150 rpm) [21,22] .
2.4. Statistical analysis
The statistical analyses were performed by the use of multi-
ple regressions and ANOVA with the softwares Minitab v 14.0 andEssential Regression v 2.2. The signiﬁcance of each variable wasdetermined by applying Student’s t-test [23,24] .
The P-value is the probability that the magnitude of a contrast
coefﬁcient is due to random process variability. A low P-value indi-
cated a “real” or signiﬁcant effect.
2.5. Color and COD removal
Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was determined spectro-
metrically by 5B-1 Quick COD analyzer (LianHua EnvironmentalInstrument Institute, Langzhou, PR China). The color of the inﬂuentand the efﬂuent was monitored spectrophotometrically (Hach DR2000). Color and COD removal were determined using the followingequations [17] .
