3 Abstract  
Valpro ate (VPA) was first  approved as an antiepileptic drug in 1962 . It has since also become  
established as a mood stabiliser and as prophylaxis for migraine. In 1979 , Lautin publish ed the 
first description of a VPA -associated  extrapyramidal syndrome . Many cases of VPA -associated 
parkinsonism have subsequently been published , but uncertainties remain concerning its  
prevalence, risk factors and prognosis.  The aim of this review was t o provide a critical review  of 
the existing literature on VP A-associated parkinsonism  and to discuss  possible mechanisms . 
Literature databases  were searched systematically.  The quality of the evidence was assessed and 
probability of causation was examined using the Naranjo score.  We identified a total of 116 
patients with VPA -associated parkinsonism published in case reports, case series and systematic 
analyse s. Prevalence rates ranged  widely , between 1.4 % and 75% of patients on VPA . There was 
great heterogeneity with regard to clinical presentation, age of onset, VPA dose , concomitant 
conditions and imaging findings . In all patients apart from three , VPA plasma levels were within 
or even below the recommended reference range  when the parkinsonism occurred . Parkinsonism 
was reversible in the majority of patients, although recovery was often prolonged  and sometimes 
incomplete . A dopaminergic deficit was confirmed  in three of six patients investigated  with 
dopamine transporter imaging . Seven of 14 patients  who were treated with  dopaminergic 
medication had a good response . The Naranjo score ranged  from 0 to 7  (median: 5.0 ). Several 
pathophysiological mechanisms  including altered gene expression and neurotransmitter signalling,  
enhanced neurodegeneration or unmasking subclinical dopaminergic degeneration could  
theoretically lead to VPA -associated parkinsonism . Further studies are war ranted to elucidate this 
entity and its underlying pathophysiology.  
    
  
4 Key points  
- Although valproate -induced parkinsonism is widely accepted as an entity, it has become 
clear  that its phenotype is quite heterogenous and that there are still uncertainties regarding 
clinical presentation , frequency, risk  factors, course and outcome . 
- Several potential pathophysiological mechanisms t hat could theoretically l ead to 
parkinsonian features with valproate are discussed.     
  
5 1. Introduction  
Valpro ate (VPA) was first approved in 1962 for treating epilepsy  [1]. It subsequently became 
established not only as one of the standard antiepileptic drugs but also as a mood stabiliser and for 
migraine prophylaxis  [2, 3]. Chemically, VPA is a small branched fatty acid which is thought to 
block voltage -dependent sodium channels and to increase the levels of -aminobutyric acid 
(GABA ) by inhibiting GABA degradation enzymes, probably by the inhibition of succinyl 
semiadenylate dehydrogena se and GABA transaminase [4, 5]. Apart from these short -term 
metabolic changes, there is growing evidence for associated long -term effects that require several 
weeks to be come  established , and that might even persist beyond the cessation of VPA intake  [4].  
The spectrum of VPA is wide and includes weight gain, hair loss, bruising/bleeding, tremor , 
hyperammonaemia presenting as encephalopathy associated with liver failure and pancreatitis  [6-
11]. Parkinsonism is another adverse drug reaction (ADR) that has been reported to occur with 
VPA . The first published case of an extrapyramidal syndrome with VPA was i n 1979 , by Lautin et 
al. [12]. Several case series, case  reports and smaller  studies focusing on VPA -associated  
parkinsonism  have been published since.  Despite the considerable number of publications on this 
topic , current evidence supporting  the association of VPA  and parkinsonism  is still limited. It 
should be noted that, in 2011, Mahmoud and Tampi provided a review of VPA -associated  
parkinsonism  [13], but they focused only on elderly patients.  The aim s of this paper  are to provide 
a comprehensive and critical review of the existing  literature a nd to discuss possible hypothese s 
for the mechanism of VPA -associated  parkinsonism . 
 
2. Literature search methodology  
2.1 Search Strategy  
Literature databases ( PubMed/Medline , EMBASE, Cochrane Library, SciSearch)  were searched 
systematically using the terms “extrapyramidal or parkinson$” (to include parkinson, 
parkinsonism and Parkinson’s) and “(valproate , valproic  or divalproex )”. We also performed a   
  
6 search for conference papers (published as abstracts in major topic journals). Articles were 
included in this review if the authors made the clinical diagnosis of parkinsonism in their patients , 
although the diagnostic criteria were not always clearly stated . Only a rticles published in English 
were considered . The reference lists of all relevant articles were  screened for other publications 
that might have been missed by the database  search. The abstract s of all articles were  reviewed , 
and relevant articles were chosen for further evaluation on the basis  of the information provided . 
In the second step, all relevant articles were analysed for the following information: number of 
patients with parkinsonism, patient age  and sex, indication for VPA , VPA  dose and plasma  levels,  
clinical presentation,  duration of VPA intake  at onset of parkinsonism , outcome after stopping 
VPA , use of dopaminergic  medication  for treatment of the associated parkinsonian symptoms , 
concurrent conditions  and medication intake ; the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale  
(UPDRS III ; scale range: 0 -108 points ) scores were retrieved  (where  provided) . If dopaminergic 
drugs were used, the levodopa equivalence dose was calculated [14]. Publications were also 
searched  for compute d tomography ( CT), magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ), [123I]-Ioflupane 
(DATScanTM) and [123I]beta -CIT (2-beta-carbomethoxy -3-beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane) SPECT 
findings . The quality of the articles  was assessed according to the classification of evidence  of the 
American Academy of Neurology [15] and the Naranjo score  aiming at estimating  the likelihood 
of a causal relationship between a drug and putative adverse effect was calculated for each case  
based on the information provided  [16]. Calculation was omitted if the cases of VPA -associated 
parkinsonism were part of a larger cohort and not enough clinical information  on the individual 
cases was available . 
The Naranjo score ranges from 0 to 13 , with higher scores indicating a higher probability of a 
causal relationship  [16]. The score  range s are classified as follows: scores of >=9 indicate a 
definitive ADR , scores from 5 to 8 a probable ADR, scores between 1 and 4 a possible ADR , and 
0 is considered as a doubtful ADR . Descriptive statistics (mean  or median , range) were  used to 
presen t data in a systematic way.  Relevant d ata were harmonized  to a single unit (to mg/l for   
  
7 plasma levels , months for treatment duration  and years for age)  to allow comparisons  and 
statistic al analysis . The data were extracted and reviewed by the same person (F. Br.)  
 
3. Literature search results   
3.1 Selection of Studies and Patient Populations  
We identified 32 publications with a total of 116 patients who were diagnosed as developing  
parkinsonism with VPA  (see table 1 ). Three publications fulfilled the criteria for class III evidence 
[17-19], whereas all other publications were  classified  as class IV evidence. One article was only 
available in abstract form  [20]. In another publication, the pati ent described was on a combination 
of VPA  and carbamazepine  but the parkinsonism occurred in clear temporal relationship to the 
introduction of carbamazepine and disappeared after stopping it [21]. Because the authors could 
not exclude the possibility that the interaction between CBZ and VPA had led to the clinical 
presentation, we also included this case report . Three cases were published as conference papers 
[22-24]. Among the 32 publications  identified , there were 18 case reports  [12, 20, 21, 23-37], 5 
case series with a total of 20 patients [38-41] and 9 systematic analyses with a total of 78 patients  
[17-19, 22, 42-46]. As far as we could determine , no patient was included in more than one of 
these studies, i.e. there was no “double counting” . The prevalence was systematically determined 
in five articles and was found to be between 1.4% and 10.7%  [17-19, 45, 46]. The largest number 
of cases was reported by Armon et al . who assessed motor, cognitive and hearing adverse  effects  
[43]. They reported that 27 of 36 patients treated with VPA (i.e. 75%) developed parkinsonism . 
Notably, this cases series accounts for about one quarter of all cases identified by our literature 
search .  
Considering all the publications  together , of those patients for whom gender was stated, 41.4% 
were m ale (24/58) and 58.6% female  (34/58). The m edian  age, calculated from the 90 patients for 
whom information was available,  was 63.5 years (range : 12 to 82). In the majority of cases  Commented [FB1]: Dear Florian , we have the same 
initials, namely F.B.; That is why I have altered your 
initials to F.Br.    
  
8 (n=79), epilepsy was the primary indication for prescribing VPA . The other reasons for 
prescribing VPA were bipolar disorder  (n=4), depression (n=2), schizophrenia (n=1), psychiatric 
complications  due to an underlying neurodegenerative disorder (n= 2) and a myoclonic disorder 
after an acute illness  (n=1) . The median VPA dose was 1250 mg (n=60; range: 250 -3000 mg ) and 
median duration on VPA until the onset of parkinsonism  was 34.2 months ( n=54; range: 0.1-360 
months ). Only 3/37 patient s were reported as having  excessive VPA plasma levels  (112, 115 and 
121 mg/ml, respectively ), when the parkinsonism occured , while for 33/37 patients plasma level s 
were  within the recommended reference range for treating epilepsy (40-100 mg/ l) [47] and for 
1/37 below this range (25.3 mg/l) [37]. In some  patients, the plasma levels were just reported as 
being  “normal ” (n=8; [35, 45, 46]) or “below the therapeutic range” (n=1; [27]) without providing 
further details regarding the exact levels.  In another 6 patients, only the mean for the whole 
population was provided  [17]. 
 
3.2 Clinical Presentation and Course of the Parkinsonism   
The c linical presentation was quite heterogeneous  among the cases . It included various 
combinations of  akinesia and hypokinesia,  micrographia,  increased muscle tone (i.e. rigidity) or 
cogwheel rigidity , dysarthria , resting, action and postural tremor, walking difficulties, festination, 
postural instability, upgaze restriction, cerebellar features, pyramidal signs, autonomic features, 
mainly urinary incontinence , and drooling and  dysphagia. Cognitive  impairment , including 
bradyphrenia, disorientation and apraxia, agnosia or aphasia , either as a new clinical feature or as 
a deterioration of a pre -existing dementia , were  sometimes described as an accompanying feature. 
The severity of the clinical presen tation also covered a wide range from mild to very severe with 
dementia and complete loss of physical independence (including being wheelchair bound  or 
bedridden ). The UPDRS III scores  [48] were provided for 31 patients , with a median of 18 points 
(range: 4-98). Information on comorbidities other than the indication for VPA prescription was   
  
9 available for 29 patients and included condition s with predominant basal ganglia involvement , 
such as probable Parkinson disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), vascular parkinsonism, 
pre-existing tremor conditions or Huntington disease , and other comorbidities such a s urinary tract 
infection, acute illness due to urosepsis, systemic lupus erythematosus with secondary renal 
failure, history of head trauma, depression, cerebral inflammatory granuloma, functional overlay, 
coeliac disease, chronic renal impairment, depres sion, cerebral palsy, neurofibromatosis, 
alcoholism, arterial hypertension, hypercholesterol aemia , stroke, cerebral lymphoma, breast 
cancer, meningioma, arachnoid cyst, gout, diabetes, pre -existing dementia and mental retardation. 
A history of previous or concomitant intake of neuroleptic  medication  was reported for nine 
patients. In another patient, meto clopramide and haloperidol  were added five and ten days , 
respectively,  after stopping the VPA . It should be noted that both  anti-dopaminergic  agents  led to 
a re-occurrence of the same extrapyramidal features as with  VPA . However, in contrast to the 
clinical presentation with VPA, the extrapyramidal features then responded to trihexyphenidyl 
[12]. 
VPA was reported as having been stopped in 71 of the 116 patients . The parkinsonian features 
improved and/or resolved in 67/71 upon discontinuation  of the drug . The latency of improvement 
after stopping VPA was provided for  38 cases and was  4.5 months on average (range: 0.1-24 
months). For the other 33 cases, either no exact time frame  was provided  in the article or the 
latency until improvement was just stated approximately (e.g. “improvement within 1 year ”). 
Dopaminergic treatment, mostly levodopa, was tried in 1 6/116 patients  and was judged as being 
effective  in 7/16 patients . One patient was started on bromocryptine, but no details regarding 
treatment response were provided. Another patient was reported to be unresponsive to levodopa, 
but the exact dose was not provided.  Also, it should be noted that in three of the seven  
unresponsive cases, only a levodopa challenge was performed ( with a single dose of 200 mg 
levodopa).  In the seven who responded, t he median levodopa equivalence dose was 350 mg 
(range: 300 -600 mg) . In seven  patients  who did not benefit  the median dose was 300 mg (range:   
  
10 200-730 mg). This difference was not statistically significant. Dyskinesias occurred in one single 
patient , with a latency of 4 months. Dyskinesias were  reversible upon  stopping levodopa and after 
complete resolution of the extrapyr amidal syndrome.  
 
3.3 Neuroimaging Results  
Information on imaging was available in 33 patients. Imaging modalities included MRI in 12 
patients, CT in 16 patients , and scan s of unspecified modality (MRI or CT) in another 5 patients. 
17/33 patients were reported as having abnormal radiological findings, which  included  white 
matter changes, various degrees of cortical/subcortical atrophy with concomitant ventricular 
enlargement , and lacunar infarcts in the cerebell um, pons and the basal ganglia. Follo w-up scans 
were reported in three patients; the b rain atrophy was reversible in one of these patients . In one of 
the two other cases, the scan was normal both with the VPA and after it had been stopped. In the 
other case  pathological enlargement of the ventricles persisted despite stopping VPA . In the study 
by Armon et al. , 11 out of 16 patients with neurological adverse effects following  VPA intake 
were reported as showing progressive or new cerebral atrophy  with VPA . However, it remains 
unclear which of them eventually had developed parkinsonism. Four patients had a DATScanTM 
and another two had a beta-CIT SPECT  scan. These scans revealed a presynaptic dopaminergic 
deficit in three of the six patients. The three with an abnormal scan had a median age of 67 years  
(range: 65 -87 years)  and the three with a normal scan a median age of 75 years  (range: 65 -75 
years). However, this age difference was not statistical ly significant . Onofrj et al. performed a 
99mTc -bicisate SPECT in two patients  [38]. The scans revealed reduced  blood flow in the right 
temporal lob e, and both the left frontal and temporal lobe, respectively.  In a case report by Evans 
et al. fluorodeoxyglucose (18F) -PET revealed hypometabolism in the bilateral periventricular, 
right -sided anterior parietal and frontal region s [26]. Tada et al.  reported a frontal blood flow 
reduction on a cerebral blood flow scan, but the authors did not provide further information 
regarding the tracer used  [37].

3.4. Naranjo score  
The median Naranjo score was 5.0 with a range from  0 to 7 (n=59).  
 
4. Discussion  
We reviewed and summarized the existing literature on VPA -associated parkinsonism . In 2011, 
Mahmoud and Tampi reviewed  this issue [13], but they focused only on the elderly and did not 
review the literature as systematically  as we did  it here (although our review does not fulfil the 
PRISM A criteria for a systematic review due to the lack of well designed randomized -controlled 
trials  [49]). In our literature search, we identified 32 relevant publications, comprising case 
report s, case series a nd systematic analyses with a total of 116 patients. We aimed at 
charact erizing this entity with regard  to frequency and clinical features on the basis of the existing 
literature.  
The prevalence rates indicated  in the systematic analyses  included covered a wide range from 
1.4% up to 75% of patients treated with VPA, with a slightly higher preponderance of women. 
The majority of authors , however, suggest ed rates lower  than 10% . By far the most common 
primary diagnosis , which led to the prescription of VPA,  was epilepsy , followed by  various 
psychiatric conditions such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. With regard to  clinical 
presentation , the reports  of VPA -associated  parkinsonism were  very heterogeneous . There was a 
wide  range of age  at onset, latency from treatment initiation  to first presentation  and symptom 
severity (with some patient s even becoming  bedridden ). It was striking that , even in very severe 
cases with a history of many  years of neurological complications , symptoms could often be 
revers ed after stopping VPA . Imaging techniques to prove a dopaminergic deficit (DATScanTM, 
beta-CIT SPECT) r evealed mixed results , showing a dopaminergic deficit in half of the patients . 
Response to dopaminergic treatment, mainly levodopa , varied from no ne to excellent.  When VPA 
plasma levels were measured, in almost all cases the y were within the reference range  as   
  
12 suggested by the International League Against Epilepsy  [47]. The possibility of a relationship 
between  parkinsonism and VPA level was investigated systematically in only one study but no 
correlation was found  [46] and parkinsonism was also reported in patients on VPA doses as low as 
250 mg per day . Of note, t he typical maximum recommended dose for epilepsy i s 2.4 g daily.  
Although the entity of VPA -associated  parkinsonism seems to be widely accepted and recognized, 
numerous questions remain unanswered : First, the frequency is still unclear. In view of the very 
large numbers of patients receiving VPA, it would appear that either the frequency of 
parkinsonism is quite low or many cases go unrecognised. Second, the risk factors for developing 
VPA -associated  parkinsonism remain unclear. There may be  an individual genetic susceptibility, 
and possibly a “double -hit” mechanism consisting of an individual genetic susceptibly followed 
by exposure to the offending drug, as proposed for neuroleptic -associated  parkinsonism, may 
apply [50]. Third, there was a broad spectrum of associated symptoms and we could not identify a 
single characteristic phenotype. Fourth, it remains unclear whether an underlying dopaminergic 
deficit is essential for developing VPA -associated parkinsonism, as only a  small number of 
patients identified for this review underwent a DATscanTM or beta -CIT scan. Fifth, the long -term 
outcome remains unknown , but would be of great interest with regard to managing these patients.   
Beyond the clinical presentation, the underly ing pathophysiology also remains unclear. Several 
mechanisms for  the development of parkinsonism with VPA  can be considered , as follows  (2).  
I.) Altered neurotransmitter signalling:  VPA has a strong GABAergic effect  [5]. GABA  can 
inhibit dopa minergic activity in the substantia nigra [51] and e xcessive GABAergic activity in the 
globus pallidus externus can lead to overactivity of the indirect basal ganglia pathway [52, 53]. 
The observation by Lautin that anti-dopaminergic  medication s cause d a similar  clinical 
presentation as VPA in the same patient may moreover  suggest  common  neuronal pathways  
associated with extrapyramidal adverse effects of these two drug classes  [12]. The good response 
to levodopa in some cases reinforces the hypothesis  of an involvement of the  dopaminergic   
  
13 pathway. The reversibility of symptoms  after discontinuation of  VPA would also be in line with 
disturbances on the transmitter signalling level.   
II.) Altered gene expression:  There are reports  of patients requiring up to several weeks to recover 
after the VPA was discontinued . Because VPA has a relatively short half -life of six to eight hours 
[54], it has been argued that it would be unlikely that an increased  GABAergic action  alone could 
be responsible for the evolution of parkinsonism (although it should be noted that plasma half -life 
does not necessarily correlate with the brain effect of a neurotropic drug ). It has been shown that 
VPA also activates various intracellular signalling pathways, which , in turn , switch on  the 
transcription  of numerous target genes  [4]. For example , VPA activates the extracellular -regulated 
kinases (ERK) pathway, which  is involved  in synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis and neuronal 
survival  [55, 56]. It should be  noted that  haloperidol, one of the most potent drugs to induce  
parkinsonism, acts in a similar way  on the ERK signalling pathway [57]. It has also been shown 
that VPA  upregulates the expression of the dopamin e transporter and it could thus lead to 
increased transmitter re-uptake and decreased availability of dopamine in the synaptic cleft [58]. 
VPA  has strong histone deacetylase activity and can thus regulate  gene expression through 
modifying  chromosomal acetylation status and subsequently of DNA packaging  resulting in an 
increased accessibility of the transcriptional machinery to DNA  [4]. This way of regulating  gene 
expression by VPA has been shown for par-4, a protein involved in  dopamine receptor signalling 
[59]. In summary, long-term effects of VPA  might  affect  dopamine signalling by modulating the 
expression of involved proteins , possibly  explaining  the often prolonged  recovery period.    
III.) Unmasking subclinical dopaminergic degeneration:  Two cases  were proven to  have a 
presynaptic dopaminergic deficit  [28, 32] and one case was clinically diagnosed as having PD four 
years after stopping VPA [60]. This  may point  to the possibility either of unmasking subclinical 
dopaminergic degeneration  or of the induction of dopaminergic degeneration in patients at risk 
when they take VPA. One explanation may be that  in patients with a subclinical dopaminergic 
deficit, increased GABAergic activity or an altered gene expression lead s to a breakdown of    
  
14 compensatory processes in the basal ganglia networks  and eventually to t he evolution of a 
clinical ly manifest  syndrome . Many of the patients with VPA -associated parkinsonism were also 
elderly or had concomitant neurological conditions such as dementia  [43]. These observation s 
could also point to  the importance of an age-related  or comorbidity -related decre ased capacity to 
reverse toxic  effects .  
IV.) Enhanced neurodegeneration:  Another possibility may be that VPA promotes ongoing 
neurodegenerative processes  in the dopaminergic system  [13], particularly on the mitochondrial 
level by inducing a state of cellular energy deficiency and increased oxidative stress [60]. 
Mutations  in one of the PD genes could  further increase the susceptibility of dopaminergic 
neurons to associated detrimental effects  [61]. In line with this, disrupted mitochondrial function  
has also been proposed in the pathogenesis of  Parkinson disease  [62]. The notion of mitochondrial  
dysfunction secondary to VPA may also supported by the alleged observation of hearing loss , a 
common clinical sign in mitochondrial disorders,  as a further  adverse effect  of VPA  [43]. Of note, 
abnormalities  in the putamen , as can also be observed in mitochondrial di sorders  such as complex 
I deficiency , were described  in one of the case series [30, 63]. 
V.) Co-occurrence with PD:  As the majority of the patients were older, the likelihood of 
developing coincidental PD is considerable. However , in most of the  cases  the first symptoms 
were recognized a few weeks to months after starting VPA  and in many cases the parkinsonism 
recovered completely or improved significantly after stopping the drug,  favouring a causal 
relationship.  
To shed more light on the clinical present ation  and pathophysiology, a systematic study in a large 
patient cohort with baseline assessments before starting on VPA and standardized assessments 
both while patients are taking VPA and for a follow -up period would be required. Methods should 
include va lidated clinical scores such as the UPDRS  and cognitive tests. DATScansTM should be 
performed in those who develop parkinsonian features to establish whether there is a 
dopaminergic deficit [64]. Screening tests for risk factors for PD, such as REM sleep behaviour   
  
15 disorder and hyposmia [65] and the inclusion of genetic risk factors, particularly for developing 
PD and mitochondrial disorders [66], might support the detection of patients at high risk of 
developing parkinsonism with VPA. Long -term follow -up of those who do develop VPA -
associated parkinsonism will provide prognostic factors that may guide clinicians in the 
information they provide to patients in the future with regard to the outcome in those who 
discon tinue VPA.  
Our review has some limitations. There  is a lack of  consistency in reporting relevant information  
such as plasma levels, latency to evolution of symptoms after starting the dose and latency until 
improvement on stopping the drug . Therefore, it was sometimes difficult to  compare the  reports . 
Clinical descriptions were sometimes inadequate  or inconclusive with regard to the clinical 
aspects of interest for this review . Furthermore, cases were followed  up at different intervals. We 
identified  eight systematic analyses , in which cases of VPA -associated parkinsonism were 
included. Although systematic analyses with larger number of patients are thought to provide 
higher level of evidence, they are usually at the expense of more detailed information on 
individual cases. Another limitation is  the fact that authors previously used different definitions 
for parkinsonism.  Whil st bradykinesia is now considered as  the core feature  [67], some authors, 
particularly in the older literature, used a combination of typical symptoms as diagnostic criteria 
without necessarily  requiring the presence of bradykinesia. For example, Armon et al . described 
26 patients with “parkinsonism ”, but only 22 had bradykinesia [43] and in the  study by Nouveilles 
et al. the presence of a typical resting tremor alone was sufficient for the diagnosis of 
parkinsonism  [46]. Also, we cannot exclude that VPA -induced postural tremor, a frequent  side 
effects with VPA treatment  [9, 10], may have been misdiagnosed as parkinsonism by some 
authors thus leading to errors in case ascertainment . All these issues make it difficult to assess the 
incidence of VPA -associated parkinsonism  accurately , but rates of 75% as suggested by Armon et 
al. are very likely  to be an overestimat e, since such a high rate is neither consistent with most 
published reports nor with clinical experience .

5. Conclusion  
The clinical presentation of VPA -associated parkinsonism is heterogeneous  and not yet well 
established . There are several possible pathophysiological mechanisms  but the current literature 
does not allow any firm conclusions  to be drawn . Prospective and  systematic  collection of relevant 
data from a large cohort of patients taking VPA may provide the answers to some of the 
unresolved questions . Although  the symptoms are reversible in most cases  of VPA -associated  
parkinsonism, the fact that some patients are left with residual deficits  underscores the importance 
of gaining a better understanding of this entity .
