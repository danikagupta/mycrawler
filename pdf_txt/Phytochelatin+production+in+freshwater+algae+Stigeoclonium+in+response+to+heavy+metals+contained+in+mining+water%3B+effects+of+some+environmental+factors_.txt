Abstract
Response to elevated Zn concentrations of two various ecotypes of the periphytic green alga 
Stigeoclonium tenueYMz.  was studied. An ecotype, classified as S. tenue  (T), isolated from ditches 
containing mining water, was Zn-tolerant. It was able to grow and reproduce by zoospores at external 
Zn concentrations >15 piM. Another ecotype of this species, classified as S. tenue  (S), isolated from 
unpolluted lake water was Zn-sensitive; its exposure to 15 piM and higher Zn concentration caused 
a significant decrease of chlorophyll content, inhibition of zoospore settling and, finally, death. The 
morphology of mature thalli of these two ecotypes cultivated under the same conditions also differed, 
i.e. the erect system of S. tenue  (T) consisted of filaments with long, narrow cells, while the erect 
system of S. tenue  (S) consisted of filaments with shorter, barrel-shaped cells. Therefore, S. tenue  (S) 
thalli were more compact than thalli of S. tenue  (T).  S. tenue  (T) exposed to 30 piM Zn for 3 weeks 
was able to release zoospores, while S. tenue  (S) was not. The two algal ecotypes differed in the 
amount of intracellularly accumulated Zn and Pb. The Zn-tolerant ecotype S. tenue  (T) accumulated 
(independently of the exposure conditions like pH and orthophosphate concentration) significantly 
more Zn and Pb than the Zn-sensitive ecotype. A new cytochemical method was developed to visu­
alise intracellular Zn in algal cells. In the long-term, Zn-exposed cells of both ecotypes, pink-orange 
Zn-dithizone complexes were observed in peripheral vacuoles, while in cells not exposed to Zn, no 
deposits were present. The data obtained suggest that the Zn-tolerant ecotype S. tenue  (T) is able 
to detoxify the excess of accumulated zinc more effectively than the sensitive ecotype, however, 
vacuolar Zn compartmentalisation does not seem be the main tolerance mechanism.

1. Introduction
Enrichment of heavy metals in the bed and water of streams and rivers selects for a 
particular micro- and macroflora over a long period of time (Center et al., 1988; Takamura 
et al., 1989). Periphytic filamentous green algae belonging to the genus Stigeoclonium  
(Chaetophorales) are organisms of high plasticity, living at a broad range of environmental 
conditions differing in pH, salinity, and nutrient and pollutant concentrations (McLean 
and Benson-Evans, 1974; Francke and Rhebergen, 1982; Francke and Ten Cate, 1980; 
Kinross et al., 2000). Stigeoclonium tenue  is frequently reported as an alga inhabiting waters 
polluted by heavy metals, and alga populations from sites with high zinc levels are more 
resistant to zinc than those from sites with low zinc levels (Harding and Whitton, 1976; 
Kelly and Whitton, 1989; Takamura et al., 1990). However, the mechanisms underlying the 
Zn-resistance and development of metal-resistant populations of algae are not recognised. In 
this paper, Zn-resistance, intracellular zinc and lead accumulation and Zn localisation in two 
different ecotypes of S. tenueKütz.,  isolated from habitats differing in heavy metal content, 
were compared to look for possible mechanisms of Zn-adaptation. A new cytochemical 
method was developed, which enabled visualisation of intracellularly accumulated Zn in 
the studied algae.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Isolation and cultivation o f algae
S. tenue  Kritz. grew abundantly in a drainage stream flowing from a zinc and lead ore mine 
in southern Poland. It was isolated at the end of April 1998. The mining water contained 
mainly Zn (15 piM); its chemical characteristics were reported earlier Pawlik-Skowroriska, 
2001). The alga was cultivated in modified Woods Hole medium, pH 7.2 (Simons et al., 1986) 
under laboratory conditions (21±1 °C, ina 12:12 light-dark regime, light 35 pimol m - 2 s-1 ). 
Taxonomic investigation of this strain, based on the type of zoospore germination and thal- 
lus propagation, was carried out according to Simons et al. (1986). This ecotype of alga was 
classified as S. tenue  (T). Another ecotype, classified as S. tenue  (S), was isolated from un­
polluted lake water in the Reserve Area Botshol in the Netherlands and cultivated under the 
same laboratory conditions as S. tenue  (T). Morphological observations were made using a 
light microscope.
2.2. Zn-sensitivity
Mature thalli of each ecotype (50 mg fresh weight) were exposed to 15piM zinc (as 
nitrate) in Woods Hole medium, pH 7, for 8 days under the temperature and illumination 
conditions mentioned in Section 2.1. Both algae without Zn addition were also cultivated 
(control cultures). Three biomass samples were withdrawn from each culture for chlorophyll 
determinations (made in two repetitions). Chlorophyll (a + b ) content was determined in 
algal biomass after extraction in 80% acetone and calculations were made according to 
McKinney (1941). The dry weight (DW) was determined by drying the algae at 90 °C.

2.3. Long-term Zn effect on algal growth and zoospore settling
Thalli of 60 mg fresh weight (FW) of each ecotype were inoculated in Woods Hole 
medium (of various orthophosphate concentrations), pH 7, spiked with 30 piM Zn and 
cultivated under the above conditions for 3 weeks. Algal cultures without Zn addition were 
regarded as controls. Macroscopic and microscopic observations of thallus morphology and 
zoospore germination were carried out. Chlorophyll (a + b ) content was also determined.
2.4. Zn and Pb accumulation
In short-term accumulation experiments, 30 mg FW of algal biomass was placed for 17 h 
in a non-complexing solution of 5mM  Hepes buffer (pH 6 .8 or 8.2) containing 2.2 mM 
Ca(N 0 3 ) 2  and 15piM Zn(N 0 3 ) 2  or Pb(N 0 3)2-  In long-term accumulation experiments, 
60 mg FW was placed for 3 weeks in the modified Woods Hole medium of lowered or­
thophosphate concentrations (0.01 or 0.3 mg P I-1 ) containing 30 piM ZnfNCHh. Four in­
dependent algal samples were then withdrawn from each culture, washed three times with 
5 mM EDTA and deionised water to remove superficially bound metals and mineralised. 
Wet mineralisation of the dry biomass was carried out using HNO 3 and H 2O2 ( 2:1, v/v) 
and ultrasonication. The Zn and Pb contents in the mineralised biomass samples were 
determined by means of atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS).
2.5. Ultrastructural Zn localisation
Algae were cultivated in Woods Hole medium spiked with 15 piM ZnfNCHh. Then algae 
were separated from the medium by filtration and washed with 5 mM EDTA and deionised 
water. A rapid cytochemical method was developed to detect Zn in algal cells. Cytochem- 
ical staining of zinc in cells was achieved by placing Stigeoclonium  filaments in 0.005% 
dithizone made up in 50:50 ethyl alcohol and deionised water. Cells were treated with this so­
lution for 15 min at room temperature. The dithizone solution did not cause cell plasmolysis. 
The analysis of intracellular localisation of zinc was carried out with the light microscope 
by looking for pink-orange complexes of dithizone with heavy metals (Marczenko and 
Balcerzak, 1998). Controls consisted of filaments not subjected to Zn, but otherwise treated 
exactly as the tests.
3. Results
The S. tenue  ecotypes isolated from the freshwaters of different zinc content were com­
pared for their morphology, asexual reproduction, Zn-resistance, intracellular Zn and Pb 
accumulation, as well as Zn compartmentalisation. The morphology of mature thalli of 
the ecotypes studied differed from each other, concerning their erect systems, while the 
prostrate systems of the algal thalli were similar. The erect system of S. tenue  (T) consisted 
of long filaments with long, narrow cells, while S. tenue  (S) filaments consisted of shorter, 
barrel-shaped cells (Fig. 1). As a consequence, thalli of S. tenue  (T) were less compact than 
the thalli of S. tenue  (S). High Zn concentrations exerted different impacts on the ecotypes.

During long-term exposure to 30 piM Zn, S. tenue  (T) released zoospores which developed 
to young thalli, while the Zn-sensitive ecotype did not. As shown in Table 1,15 piM Zn was 
toxic for S. tenue  (S) isolated from unpolluted water. During an 8-day exposure, its thalli 
bleached compared with non-exposed control thalli; chlorophyll (a + b ) content decreased

by 48%. In S. tenue  (T), isolated from mining water with an elevated Zn concentration, such 
symptoms of metal toxicity were not observed. During the 3-week Zn exposure (Table 3), 
thalli of the Zn-sensitive S. tenue  (S) became yellowish and their chlorophyll content was 
lower by 60% compared with the green thalli of the Zn-resistant ecotype S. tenue  (T).
Independent of the conditions of metal exposure (time, pH of surrounding medium and 
orthophosphate concentration), S. tenue  (T) accumulated intracellularly significantly more 
Zn and Pb than S. tenue  (S) (Tables 2 and 3). At alkaline pH (8.2), only Pb accumulation was 
lower than at a near-neutral pH ( 6.8). After long-term exposure (Table 3) to 30 piM Zn in a 
nutrient solution, the green thalli of S. tenue  (T) contained approximately 13 fold more Zn 
than the bleached thalli of S. tenue  (S). Elevated orthophosphate concentration (0.3 mg P I-1 ) 
in solution did not decrease significantly the Zn accumulation in both ecotypes compared 
with exposure at a low P concentration (0.01 mg I-1 ).
To study intracellular localisation of accumulated zinc in S. tenue,  a new simple cyto- 
chemical method using dithizone was developed. When the dark green solution of dithizone 
contacted fresh filaments of the long-term Zn-exposed Stigeoclonium,  pink-orange deposits

of zinc-dithizone complexes were observed in peripheral vacuoles (Fig. 2C and D). Such 
Zn localisation was characteristic for both ecotypes. However, in the Zn-sensitive eco­
type, only filaments which survived, revealed the Zn compartmentalisation in vacuoles. 
In short-term exposed thalli (2 days), there were no colourful deposits in vacuoles, but the 
entire cytoplasm was homogeneously coloured, indicating that Zn had not been sequestered

in vacuoles (Fig. 2B). In control preparations, not exposed to Zn but treated with dithizone, 
neither colourful deposits in vacuoles nor stained cytoplasm were observed.
4. Discussion
Stigeoclonium tenue  may be considered one of the more successful algae in zinc-polluted 
waters. The alga sampled from waters of high Zn concentrations contained more Zn in 
biomass than the alga sampled from waters of low Zn concentrations, however, the sampling 
sites differed in chemical composition (Kelly and Whitton, 1989). Data presented in this 
paper on the intracellular Zn and Pb accumulation in two different ecotypes of S. tenue  are 
in agreement with the reported observations.
It is well documented that heavy metal availability, accumulation and toxicity in aquatic 
biota depends essentially on many environmental variables (Campbell and Stokes, 1985; 
Skowroriski, 1986; Skowroriski et al., 1991; Pawlik-Skowroñska and Skowroñski, 2001; 
Pawlik-Skowronska, 2002). As reported previously (Pawlik-Skowronska, 2001), abiotic 
factors like high pH and the content of suspended matter in water play an essential role in 
modulating heavy metal bioavailability to S. tenue  by changing metal spéciation and low­
ering the level of labile metal forms. Environmental factors may also influence Zn accumu­
lation and toxicity to algae (Harding and Whitton, 1977; Vymazal, 1986). Usually, in algae 
found in the field, the amount of accumulated metals reflects both the population-specific 
accumulation capability and various metal bioavailabilities depending on the environmental 
conditions.
The data presented in this paper show, however, that two S. tenue  ecotypes accumulated, 
intracellularly, various amounts of heavy metals under the same exposure conditions. The 
ecotype, isolated from Zn-polluted mining water, independent of exposure conditions (time, 
pH and PO 4-P contents), always took up more Zn and Pb than the ecotype from unpolluted 
water. The data presented strongly suggest that the observed differences in metal accumu­
lation between S. tenue  (T) and S. tenue  (S) can be due to the ecotype properties more than 
to the exposure conditions. S. tenue  (T), the ecotype from mining water, grew well (devel­
oping long filaments ) and reproduced by zoospores at high Zn concentrations in its body 
(8 pig mg - 1 DW). According to Tevitt’s definition (1980), this ecotype is truly Zn-tolerant.
5. tenue  (S), the ecotype from unpolluted water, was Zn-sensitive. Its chlorophyll content 
decreased considerably compared with that of the tolerant ecotype and it did not survive 
at 15 piM and higher Zn concentrations, in spite of much lower internal Zn concentration 
(<1 pig mg - 1 DW). Chlorophyll damage and photosynthesis breakdown in heavy metal 
stressed aquatic plants and algae is well documented (Küpper et al., 1996, 2002). As re­
ported by Knauer et al. (1997), Zn concentrations higher than 1  piM inhibited the growth 
rate of freshwater green microalgae Scenedesmus subspicatus  and Chlamydomonas rein­
hardtii.  These toxic effects occurred in microalgae when the intracellular Zn concentration 
was higher than 3 x IO - 5 mol g - 1 algae (i.e. 1.95 pigZn mg - 1 algae). In S. tenue  (S), toxic 
effects were observed at half the intracellular Zn concentration than that mentioned above, 
while S. tenue  (T) was tolerant of a four fold higher intracellular Zn content.
The ecotypes of S. tenue  also revealed differences in thallus morphology. Such mor­
phological plasticity has been reported for other macroalgae, and for populations of
196 B. Pawlik-Skowroriska / Aquatic Botany 75 (2003) 189-198
S. tenue  inhabiting sites of different salinity (Francke and Rhebergen, 1982). As reported 
by Harding and Whitton (1976), tolerance to Zn might be lower during a particular phase 
in the life cycle of algae and in S. tenue;  increasing Zn levels brought about a reduction in 
the erect part of the thallus. Microscopic observations revealed that in S. tenue  (T), both 
filaments of the erect part and zoospores were Zn-tolerant and germinated to young thalli, 
while Zn-exposed S. tenue  (S) did not release settling zoospores and its erect filaments were 
reduced.
Mechanisms underlying metal tolerance in algae are not fully recognised and may rely on 
several mechanisms operating simultaneously. Silverberg (1975) suggested that intravac- 
uolar compartmentalisation of Pb can be a mechanism of detoxification of the metal excess 
in S. tenue.  It was also estimated (Reid et al., 1996) that in the giant cells of Chara cor­
nalina,  most of the intracellular zinc was stored in vacuoles. In this paper, a new method for 
Zn localisation in algal cells, using dithizone, has been presented. In 2-day exposed algal 
thalli, pink-orange Zn-dithizone complexes were homogeneously spread in the cytoplasm, 
however, in 6-week exposed algae, colourful Zn complexes were visible in peripheral vac­
uoles. They were observed in cells of both ecotypes of S. tenue.  This simple and rapid 
method gives, similar to the rhodizonate staining of Pb (Silverberg, 1975), only qualitative 
information on Zn localisation in algal cells. The results obtained suggest that vacuoles 
in S. tenue  are involved in Zn immobilisation and detoxification, however, it seems in­
sufficient for the observed Zn-tolerance of S. tenue  (T). Other adaptive (present only in 
tolerant phenotypes) mechanisms for coping with elevated metal concentrations in cells 
have to exist and operate in the Zn-tolerant alga. Such mechanism (Pawlik-Skowroriska, 
in press) seems to be connected with effective intracellular Zn complexation by sulphur-rich 
peptides.
5. Conclusions
Populations of the filamentous green alga S. tenue  Kritz. from different habitats appear to 
be different ecotypes with different erect system morphologies and Zn-tolerance. S. tenue  
(T) isolated from mining water, has a higher capability to accumulate Zn and Pb intracellu- 
larly than S. tenue  (S), the ecotype from unpolluted water. S. tenue  (T) is Zn-tolerant; it was 
able to grow and reproduce by zoospores at high internal Zn concentrations. S. tenue  (S) is 
a Zn-sensitive ecotype; it was poisoned in spite of a much lower internal Zn content. Tower 
metal accumulation in the Zn-sensitive ecotype was not a consequence of limited heavy 
metal availability. As shown by a new cytochemical method, intravacuolar Zn sequestration 
takes place in both ecotypes. However, it is not sufficient to protect the Zn-sensitive eco­
type against metal toxicity. Another adaptive mechanism must be involved in the observed 
Zn-tolerance of the ecotype grown in mining water.
