This supplemental ﬁle contains the data quality evaluation results for data sources that met the screening criteria for the
White Paper: Quantitative Human Health Approach to be Applied in the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental
Evaluation including Legacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos . This ﬁle was used to characterize human health
hazard from the epidemiology literature. EPA conducted data quality evaluation based on author-reported descriptions and
results (including associated methods papers); additional analyses ( e.g., statistical analyses performed during data integration
into the risk evaluation) potentially conducted by EPA are not contained in this supplemental ﬁle.
As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Human Health Approach to be Applied in the Risk Evaluation
for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation including Legacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos , additional screen-
ing was conducted based on whether the data source used standardized mortality ratios (SMR) or regression and whether the
data source contained dose-response data. Speciﬁcally, for those references that met PECO screening criteria and used SMR or
regression, data quality evaluation was conducted for data sources that received Medium or High metric ratings for Metrics 4
and 5. Data sources that received either Low or Critically Deﬁcient metric ratings for Metric 4 or Metric 5 did not proceed to
data quality evaluation; the metric ratings and comments for Metrics 4 and 5 are included in this supplemental ﬁle.
References that assessed the same cohort were linked and evaluated as a group of references or as multiple subgroups of
references from the same cohort. However, each health outcome assessed in a paper or cohort group of papers was evaluated
independently such that each reference or cohort group of references may have different overall quality determinations (OQD)
for different health outcomes. Additional comments providing a brief summary including strengths and weaknesses of the study
are presented adjacent to the OQD. If a reference also was evaluated for an evidence stream other than epidemiology, those
evaluations will be presented in a separate supplemental ﬁle with the Risk Evaluation.
As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Human Health Approach to be Applied in the Risk Evaluation
for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation including Legacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos , data quality
evaluation forms from Asbestos Part 1 were modiﬁed to reﬂect the change in scope for Asbestos Part 2. For mesothelioma,
the mesothelioma data quality evaluation form used in Asbestos Part 1 was used for Asbestos Part 2, with some modiﬁcations
based on calibration. For other outcomes, the lung cancer data quality evaluation form from Asbestos Part 1 was used with
additional modiﬁcations to evaluate other outcomes that were not considered in Part 1. The Table of Contents lists data sources
based on whether the endpoints pertained to either mesothelioma or other health outcome categories. In some circumstances,
although a study assessed both mesothelioma and other health outcomes, the mesothelioma data was not sufﬁcient to undergo
data quality evaluation ( e.g., the reference might not have met PECO screening criteria for mesothelioma), and the rationale
for not evaluating mesothelioma is documented in the “Additional Comments” ﬁeld. Modiﬁcations to the forms will be further
described in the Systematic Review Protocol that accompanies the Draft Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2.

Additional Comments: None of the studies included in this cohort evaluated mesothelioma in a way that is appropriate for evaluation (no SMRs or regression analyses) (Amandus,
1986, 3100838; Amandus & Wheeler, 1987, 29839; Amandus et al., 1988, 783513). For Amandus & Wheeler, the authors describe that there were two cases
of mesothelioma observed, and they provided information on tenure, general exposure levels, and proportional mortality rate (1987, 29839).For Amandus
et al., the authors only note the number of mesothelioma diagnoses indicated on death certiﬁcates, with no mortality rates or SMRs/regressions (1988,
783513).For the Amandus study, the author provides some details about tenure, latency, and the number of cases of mesothelioma detected. Proportional
mortality rates are also reported (1986, 3100838).

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Dust concentration measurements were taken periodically at the mine and mill. A ko-
niometer, which is a device used to estimate the amount of dust in the air, was utilized
between 1948 and 1958. This only measured total dust per cubic centimeter (ppcc), and
it had an upper limit of 1,000 ppcc. This limit was often exceeded. A survey was under-
taken to determine the concentration of airborne crocidolite ﬁbers greater than 5 microns
in length in 1966. A Casella long running thermal precipitator was used to generate the
data. A Casella gravimetric dust sampler and a Hexhelt were also used to estimate dust
mass. No impingers or PCM/TEM were utilized in this study.This metric is rated low
because the studies or any cited methods source does not explicitly mention the use of
PCM or TEM (Armstrong et al., 1988, 3083076; Reid et al., 2018, 6874474).
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The ﬁgure included in the Armstrong et al., 1988, (HERO ID: 3083076) paper displays
mesothelioma mortality amongst the miners and millers at various exposure levels.
They are split into groups as follows: <10 f/cc y, 10-100 f/cc y, and >100 f/cc y. They
also include all exposures combined, which includes unknown exposures.The levels of
exposure in the Reid et al. 2018 (HERO ID: 6874474) paper included <10 f/mL years,
10-50 f/mL years, and >50. These values allow for the development of an exposure-
response estimate.
Additional Comments: NOTE: This cohort was rated "Low" for Metric 4, and thus does not meet the criteria for usefulness for dose-response. Only outcome inventory, ﬁber types,
and Metrics 4 and 5 received a QC.There are some concerns about the methods used to analyze mesothelioma outcomes. 32 mesothelioma deaths were
reported in this study, but there was no SMRs or associated conﬁdence intervals reported. They did mention that there was a statistically signiﬁcant excess
of mesothelioma deaths, but there is no information from the analysis to further support this.
?No biomarkers were identiﬁed for this evaluation.
??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation
Including Legacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos , to be considered as being informative for dose-response analysis, Metrics 4 and 5 would need metric ratings of Medium
or High. This reference did not satisfy this requirement; therefore a data quality evaluation was not conducted.

assembled military gas masks, 1940-1945, using ﬁlter pads containing 20% crocidolite
asbestos. Within this cohort, a subset was selected of those with tissue samples. Lung
tissue samples were obtained from 50 (77% ) of the n=65 cases of mesothelioma, (and
n=20 deaths from other causes). Duration of employment was recorded in only 51 of the
70 deaths.
Metric 2: Attrition Medium Exclusions of subjects from the original cohort or analyses were adequately de-
scribed for the cases (n=70) with lung tissue samples selected out of the original cohort
(n=1,154) and those with employment duration data (n=-51 of n=70).
Metric 3: Comparison Group N/A This study focused upon mesothelioma outcomes.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Crocidolite asbestos ﬁber levels per microgram of dried lung were analyzed by transmis-
sion electron microscopy.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range and distribution of lung crocidolite ﬁber concentrations presented in Tables
1 and 2 by decade of death and categories (4 categories) of length (months) of exposure
are sufﬁcient to develop an exposure response relationship.
Metric 6: Temporality High The study establishes appropriate temporality and the interval between exposure and
outcome is long enough for consideration of latency of the outcome. The period of
possible exposure to crocidolite was noted to be September 1940 to March 1945 with
follow-up for deaths through 1994.
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationHigh ICD codes were not detailed within the main text, however data regarding deaths was
described in the referenced original Nottingham cohort study by McDonald et al., 2006
(HERO ID 709504) and indicate use of ICD-9 as well as employment and pathological
records for traced former workers with all deaths due to mesothelioma described as
conﬁrmed by pathology.

Metric 8: Reporting Bias High There were no concerns for selective reporting as all outcomes which were outlined
within methods were also reported within the results. Results for ﬁber concentrations
within lungs were reported across year of death and cause of death categories within
Table 1, and the regression equation was detailed in the text for the % ﬁbers by year of
death in Figure 2.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Low Other than stratiﬁcation of ﬁber concentration results across year and cause of death
categories, no adjustments for gender, age or race appear to have been made and the
distribution of primary covariates and potential confounders was not reported.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization N/A Potential confounders were not detailed as considered.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Medium The members of the cohort were workers at the Nottingham military gas mask factory
1940 through 1945. Although co-exposures were not addressed, there was no evidence
that there was an unbalanced provision of co-exposures among exposure groups. Con-
siderations for workers who might have initially left and worked elsewhere with ad-
ditional exposures but eventually returned to the gas mask factory for study were not
detailed. Authors noted that masks consisted of 20% crocidolite, but details regarding
the remaining composition of masks were not provided.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The study design was appropriate to address the main objective of analyzing lung ﬁber
burdens over time. The percentage of ﬁbers longer than 6 mm was analyzed by logistic
regression with respect to year of death. Median geometric mean crocidolite ﬁbers in
lung tissue were presented in Table 1 for year of death categories and cause of death.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The number of participants (n=70 total with n=51 with duration of employment data)
was minimal for regression analyses, although additional covariates did not appear to
have been considered within modeling.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The description of analysis is sufﬁcient to understand how to generally reproduce the
analyses. Transformation of exposure variables was described in detail. Imputation of
exposures with zero values as one-half of the limit of detection was also detailed.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Low Model building was not described in terms of the reasoning for lack of considerations
for potential confounders.
Domain 6: Other (if applicable) Considerations for Biomarker Selection and Measurement (Lakind et al. 2014)
Metric 16: Use of Biomarker of Exposure Low Evidence exists for a relationship between lung ﬁber concentrations and external ex-
posure, internal dose or target dose, but there has been no assessment of accuracy and
precision or none was reported.

Additional Comments: This study focused upon post-mortem crocidolite lung ﬁber concentrations in a subset (n=70: n=50 mesothelioma and n=20 deaths from other causes) of
the Nottingham Gas Mask cohort of n=1,154 employees with lung tissue samples who had worked 1940-1945 on the manufacture of military gas masks
with ﬁlter pads containing 20% crocidolite and who were followed through 2003. Crocidolite asbestos ﬁber levels per microgram of dried lung were
presented by decade of death and cause of death (Table 1), duration of exposure (Table 2), and the percentage of ﬁbers longer than 6 mm was analyzed with
year of death by logistic regression (Figure 2). The crocidolite counts ranged from 0 to 1,949 (mean 234, median 47) ﬁbers/ mg.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low This metric is rated Low because the study or any cited methods source does not ex-
plicitly mention the use of PCM or TEM. Dust concentrations were measured using
koniometer between 1948 and 1958. In 1966, ﬁber counting was done using a Casella
long running thermal precipitator. Personal and ﬁxed monitors were utilized in 1973.
Additional measurements were taken in 1977, 1978, 1980, 1984, 1986, and 1992, us-
ing interpolation to estimate concentrations for years that surveys were not conducted.
According to Hansen et al., 1997 2219991, all samples examined were analyzed using
the standard membrane ﬁlter method. Some exceptions were surveys in 1984 and 1986
which used SEM, and in 1992 which used TEM. Although later surveys utilized TEM,
the current study does not describe estimates in a way to know outcomes based on expo-
sures measured from 1992 and after.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The distribution of exposure appears to be sufﬁcient to develop an exposure-response
estimate. Cumulative exposure was utiliized in statistical models.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Methods for ﬁber count included ﬁber morphology and ﬁber chemistry determined
through energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, followed by calculating ﬁber concentra-
tion using an algorithm that accounted for weight of lung tissue used in the study and
number of grid squares. However, authors did not utilize PCM or TEM, thus warranting
a low rating per the guidance.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low Actual measured exposure data were not available for the cases and are estimations
based on historic data and calculations. Authors stated that exposure was not included
in their models as they felt combining years of exposure with ﬁber burden did not make
sense analytically nor is there a correlation between the two.
Additional Comments: 2/6/2023 UPDATE: DUE TO CHANGES IN THE GUIDANCE FOR SQE, ALL METRICS RATINGS EXCEPT FOR 4 AND 5 SHOULD BE IGNORED
BECAUSE METRIC 4 AND 5 WERE RATED "LOW".Authors stated crocidolite ﬁbers were detected in a small number of cases but were excluded from

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Neither PCM nor TEM were used for measuring exposure. The study measures asbestos
exposure in both a qualitative and quantitative approach. Quantitative measures came
from linking ISCO-68 codes to SYN-JEM which provided yearly exposure intensity
values for each job. From this, authors calculated individual lifetime cumulative expo-
sures to asbestos (ff/mL-years). The qualitative measure came from expert evaluations
of the ReNaM questionnaire (a standardized questionnaire that focuses on life-time
job-history) where asbestos exposure categories (never-exposed, extra-occupational, oc-
cupational probable/possible, and deﬁnite occupational exposure) were created. Recall
and interviewer bias is of concern since completing the questionnaire was done via an
interview by trained personnel (as opposed to occupational records) and assessment of
cases were non-blinded.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Four levels of exposure are deﬁned for cumulative asbestos exposure (ff/mL-years):
never exposed, <0.888, <3.158, 3.158 and over. Continuous cumulative and log-
transformed cumulative exposure are also calculated.
Additional Comments: While asbestos ﬁber type is not assessed in this study, authors state that chrysotile and amphiboles were often used in Italy.2/6/2023 UPDATE: DUE TO

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Key elements of study design were reported. Participation is not likely biased and
exposure-outcome distribution of participants is likely representative of those eli-
gible for inclusion,. However, total number of patients, from which cases with post-
mortem evaluations were chosen, with malignant mesothelioma but with no postmortem
analyses records was not provided. Authors did acknowledged the potential non-
representativeness of this population due to the patient-referred nature of cases which
included wartime dockyard and gas mask workers known to have suffered from heavy
asbestos exposure. All available pathological, occupational and lung ﬁber mineralogical
data on n=177 female malignant mesothelioma cases from unspeciﬁed ﬁle records and
unspeciﬁed geographic residential origin 1963-1990 were reviewed and compared with
n=31 female controls from Exeter, Liverpool, Befast, Dublin, and Cardiff with post-
mortem examinations and no known history of exposure to dusts and no mesothelioma
or lung cancer. Source of data for controls not detailed but assumed to have been from
the same ﬁles as cases.
Metric 2: Attrition Medium Missing information was noted for several subsets of outcome and exposure, and authors
acknowledged the lack of completeness of exposure data, however it was unclear if
this was related to exposure and/or outcome. The total number of participants with
tumor tissue slides available (n=151) was a subset of the total number of mesothelioma
cases (n=177). Tumor tissue slides were available for n=151 of a total of n=177 cases.
Two cases of the total cases tested (n=103 of the n=151 with histologic slides available)
were positive for carcinoembryonic antigen and were excluded from further analyses.
Lung tissue ﬁber burden was examined by transmission electron microscopy for n=105
tumors of known sites (Table 2). Exposure classiﬁcation according to Zielhuis et al.,
1978 (HERO ID 6910362) data was available for n= 93 cases.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium Inclusion criteria and methods of participant selection for cases and controls was re-
ported. Geographic residential origin of controls, but not cases (other than one case
from Antolia) was reported. Other than restriction of cases and controls to women and
reporting the mean (range) age of n=102 malignant mesothelioma cases (60.5 years (18-
89)) and n=31 controls (68.0 years (30-93)) for which age data was available, details
regarding other potentially relevant demographic and occupational covariate differences
between cases and controls were not considered. Statistical analyses of potential demo-
graphic or other relevant covariate differences between cases and controls was lacking,
and multivariate statistical control for differences, particularly age, between groups was
not detailed. It is unclear to what extent, if any, the healthy worker effect was involved
within results including those cases classiﬁed within Table 4 as having direct occupa-
tional exposure in comparison with the population controls.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Methods used to quantify exposure were well deﬁned, with sources of methods reported.
Lung tissue ﬁber (106 ﬁbers/g), ﬁber length and diameter analyses were assessed by
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) with energy dispersive x ray analysis us-
ing an "EDAX" machine according to the methods within Pooley et al., 1979 (HERO
ID: 3084350). Asbestos exposure classiﬁcation methods for cases only were conducted
as in Zielhuis et al., HERO ID 6910362. Exposure to asbestos was classiﬁed for n=93
(of total n=177 cases) malignant mesothelioma cases according to Zielhuis18 into cat-
egories of (la) direct occupational exposure; (lb) indirect occupational exposure-for
example, workers in the vicinity of asbestos contaminated work situations; (2) paraoccu-
pational exposure-for example, the wives of men working with asbestos; (3) neighbor-
hood exposure-for example, people living in the vicinity of asbestos mines or processing
factories; (4) exposure in ambient air; and (5) no known exposure. Only n=74 (80% of
the total n=93 cases with Zielhuis classiﬁed exposure history data of the total n=177 ma-
lignant mesothelioma cases) cases had a history of known exposure to asbestos. Zielhuis
classiﬁcation of potential historical exposure for controls was not detailed.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range and distribution of exposure is sufﬁcient to develop and exposure-response es-
timate. Table 4 presents ﬁber burden (x 10^ 6 ﬁbers/g lung) geometric mean (range) re-
sults for n=93 mesothelioma cases across ﬁve Zielhuis et al., 1978 (HERO ID 6910362)
exposure categories of direct occupational, indirect occupational, domestic, neighbor-
hood, ambient air and no known exposure categories. Table 3 reports lung ﬁber burden
(x 10^ 6 ﬁbers/g lung) across ﬁve ﬁbrosis grade categories for n=116 cases.
Metric 6: Temporality Low This study reported cross-sectional results of ﬁber burdens in mesothelioma cases as
well as cross-sectional analyses of the relationship between postmortem ﬁbrosis and
lung ﬁber burdens in mesothelioma cases and controls for which temporality cannot be
established.
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or

conﬁrmed by immunohistochemistry, although classiﬁcation of n=26 cases for which
no tumor or tissue slides were available were described as classiﬁed as with previous

Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium There were no concerns for selective reporting as all outcomes which were outlined
within methods were also reported within the results. Additional n=1,184 male cases of
mesothelioma were reported, but analyses of males was not a subset of reported objec-
tives and comparisons were only made within text with results from previous studies of
males. No formal statistical analyses between cases and controls was conducted, and no
effect estimates were reported,
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Low Analyses were restricted to female cases and controls. Additional statistical control for
potentially relevant demographic or other variables was not conducted.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low This metric is rated low because Klerk et al. 1989 783917, Reid et al. 2006 3079799,
and Reid et al. 2004 3080174 relied on historic dust measures (konimeters, thermal
precipitators) without documenting the use of appropriate conversions. These papers
cited the single time point membrane ﬁlter PCM ﬁber concentration measures that were
taken in 1966, shortly before the facility closed (publication not available in HERO or
other online sources, Major 1968 entitled the First Australian Pneumoconiosis Confer-
ence). However, they did not mention or cite a dust-to-ﬁber conversion factor, and no
such factors were identiﬁed in the literature. Concerns regarding the validity and utility
of occupational exposure measures used in Wittenoom studies have been expressed by
the industrial hygienist responsible for the membrane ﬁlter measures (e.g., Rogers and
Major 2002 HEROID 3080506).
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low The distribution of exposure provided in de Klerk et al 783917 appears to be sufﬁcient
to develop an exposure-response estimate. Cumulative exposure was used in analyses
either as a continuous variable or in 4 categories. As noted above, however, there are
important concerns remain regarding the validity of exposure estimates.
Additional Comments: Klerk et al. 1989 783917 was/were not evaluated for any metrics except Metric 4 and 5 and had no data extracted because it/they did not have sufﬁcient
exposure information to be useful for dose-response analysis.
??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation
Including Legacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos , to be considered as being informative for dose-response analysis, Metrics 4 and 5 would need metric ratings of Medium

Additional Comments: For the year of the study and the 5 different case-control analyses conducted, I agree with the rating. There are some discrepancies, such as how the
asbestos was measured and exposures to various forms of asbestos which were not regarded.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Analyses use cumulative ﬁber exposure. Additional details about exposure measurement
are reported in Lockey et al., 1984, HEROID 29685. Samples were collected via mem-
brane ﬁlters either by following an employee with a sampler (from 1972-1976) or by
breathing zone sampling (after 1976). Authors note that exposure of ﬁber was deﬁned as
"particles with a length greater than 5 um, a diameter less than 3 um, and an aspect ra-
tio of 3:1 or greater". Thus, ﬁber type was unknown, and samples likely included ﬁbers
other than asbestos. Samples were reviewed through polarized light microscopy, scan-
ning electron microscopy, and TEM. Indexes were created for each department within
the facility. Study authors used work histories reported by workers in 1980 to calcu-
late the cumulative ﬁber exposure level for each employee. Previous estimates were
revised to include additional data related to exposure collected in 2010, such as adjust-
ments for vermiculite source and changes in duration of work by season (Borton et al.,
2012, HEROID 1066035). Borton et al. also estimated exposures from 1957-1971 us-
ing estimates from 1972 with adjustments for dustier historical conditions. This study
also reported comparisons between personal and area samples and found approximately
equal means and ranges.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low For SMR analyses of mesothelioma, exposure is presented in two groups (exposed
workers and unexposed workers). Authors note the possibility that associations were
not observed due to the low exposure levels among the study population, which intro-
duces concern about the inﬂuence of the exposure distribution on the ability to detect an
effect.
Additional Comments: QC was not completed for metrics other than Metrics 4 and 5 because the study does not have sufﬁcient exposure information to be useful for dose-
response analysis.This retrospective occupational cohort study examined the association between asbestos exposure and mesothelioma mortality among
workers mining and milling contaminated vermiculite. There were no major concerns with the study, aside from limited exposure distributions among the
study population and concerns about the number of mesothelioma cases in the cohort. The approach for exposure measurement and statistical analysis was
strong, and there were no concerns about selection bias resulting from population recruitment approaches.
?No biomarkers were identiﬁed for this evaluation.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Clin et al. 2011, HERO ID: 3078903 analyzed the risk of mesotheliomas among salaried
and retired workers (men and women) from an asbestos reprocessing plant (textiles
and friction materials) in the Calvados department in Normandy, France. Eligibility
was based on: (i) working at the plant for at least 1 year; (ii) being alive in 1978 when
the regional cancer registry was established; (iii) having resided in Calvados during at
least part of the 1978 to 1995 initial follow-up period, with known vital status (de la
Provote et al al. 2002, HERO ID: 3520580). As noted by Clin et al. 2011, HERO ID:
3078903, "... since one of our inclusion criteria was that subjects had to be alive in 1978,
there may be a selection bias related to the "healthy worker effect"." Including retired
workers, however, would have helped to reduce this bias. The number of workers who
did not meet eligibility criteria was not provided; it is unknown whether a large number
of workers of similar age and employment duration as those in the cohort had cancer
diagnoses prior to 1978, which could bias results. The factories had operated using
asbestos in various capacities since 1928. All cancer cases from 1978 to 2004 were
included, resulting in 2024 subjects (1604 men).
Metric 2: Attrition High Clin et al. 2011, HERO ID: 3078903 reported that 107 subjects (5.3% ) had missing
vital status at the end of 2004 and were excluded from analysis. It is unclear why vital
status was missing, but given the relatively small share of subjects and that it would not
be expected to be related exposure and outcome make this a limited concern for bias.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium In calculating relative risk for mesothelioma, workers with varying concentrations of
exposures were compared amongst each other. There is no indication that groups were
similar but there is no indication of healthy worker effect.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Exposure estimates were assigned to individuals based on job functions and timing/
duration of employment and ﬁber count measures. As described by de la Provote et
al. 2002, HERO ID: 3520580, ﬁber counts were measured at different locations in the
plant as follows: (i) 1973 -1995 data were collected by Casella pumps on a membrane
ﬁlter, with PCM (phase-contrast light microscopy) counts of ﬁbers longer than 5 mm,
less than 3 mm in diameter, with a length/diameter ratio greater than 3; (ii) 1960-1974
data were collected on soluble ﬁlters by an ARM (Avy"Raillere"Martin) apparatus,
with light microscopy ﬁber counts as particles per liter of air; and (iii) estimates prior to
1959/1960 were based on production reports for 1939-1945 [50% of 1960 levels], lin-
early extrapolated to 1960. Date cutoffs differed slightly across manuscripts [e.g. ARM
started in 1959 vs 1960 according to Clin et al. 2011, HERO ID: 3078903]. Side-by-side
Casella vs. ARM method measures in 1974 were used to develop a conversion factor for
the different methods. A cumulative exposure index (CEI) for the entire career (ﬁbers/
mL * year) was calculated as the sum of exposure * duration for each job position. A
mean exposure concentration (MEC), also referred to as averaged exposure (AEL) was
also calculated and expressed in ﬁbers/mL). Clin et al. 2009, HERO ID: 3520549 and
Boulanger et al. 2017, HERO ID: 3077730 explain these same methods but in lesser de-
tail. Clin et al. 2011, HERO ID: 3078903 uses CEI and AEL exposure categories with a
10-year lag to account for latency.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium To estimate mesothelioma risk, only Clin et al. 2011, HERO ID: 3078903 categorized
asbestos exposure variables using 3 ordinal levels.In de la Provote et al. 2002, HERO
ID: 3520580, Clin et al. 2009, HERO ID: 3520549 and Boulanger et al. 2015, HERO
ID: 307773, SIRs are only calculated using 2 exposure categories of cumulative ex-
posure, such as exposed/unexposed or <= vs>80 ﬁbers/mL-year, all of which merit
a Low rating for this metric. Because of this, de la Provote et al. 2002, HERO ID:
3520580, Clin et al. 2009, HERO ID: 3520549, and Boulanger et al. 2015, HERO ID:
307773, are only evaluated for metrics 4 and 5.
Metric 6: Temporality High While Clin et al. 2011, HERO ID: 3078903 gives limited detail on temporality, de la
Provote et al. 2002, HERO ID: 3520580 shows that 69% of workers had at least 10 years
at work, and 50% had >= 20 years.
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationHigh Clin et al. 2011, HERO ID: 3078903 reported using ICD-O 3 codes to identify mesothe-
lioma cases, further stating that mesothelioma cases were assessed and validated by an

Metric 1: Participant Selection High This population-based case-control study included the incident cases of pleural malig-
nant mesothelioma (PMM) diagnosed between 1 January 2001 and 30 June 2006 among
residents of the Casale Monferrato Local Health Authority (LHA) in Italy. Cases were
also recruited from a random sample of the corresponding general population. The LHA
included the town of Casale Monferrato, where an asbestos plan was operational for 80
years, and the surrounding area of approximately 60 towns and villages. Cases were
identiﬁed via units of pathology, pneumology, oncology, internal medicine, oncology,
internal medicine, thoracic surgery and radiotherapy of hospitals in the study area. The
authors report that 200 out of 223 eligible cases agreed to join the study and that the
ascertained cases represented 96% of all cases of PMM in the area. No inclusion or ex-
clusion criteria appear to be used. Participants were invited by their attending clinician.
Metric 2: Attrition High The authors do not report any subject withdrawal or attrition from the analysis sample
after formal recruitment. Outcome and exposure data appear to be complete.
Metric 3: Comparison Group High Controls were selected randomly from the population rosters of the Casale Monferatto
LHA. Cases and controls were matched by date of birth ( 18 months) and gender. To
increase power in the younger age classes, the case control ratio was 1:2 for cases 60
years and older, and 1:4 for younger cases. Controls were invited by letter after their
general practitioners were informed. The authors report that 348 out of 552 controls
agreed to participate in the study. The distribution of cases and controls was similar by
sex, and cases were older than controls due to over-sampling of controls matched to
cases under 60 and "the different age distribution of non-participating controls." Infor-
mation on exposure and covariates was gathered directly via interviews from controls,
while 46% of interviews with cases were conducted with a close relative due to the case
being dead or being in poor health condition. All of these differences (gender, age, and
type of interview) were controlled for in statistical analysis. The potential for the healthy
worker effect is not discussed, but is unlikely to produce signiﬁcant bias since both con-
trols and cases had occupational experience and exposure.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium The authors do not directly reference PCM or TEM quantitative measures of exposure
in the methods. In the methods they cite various sources for where reference values for
ﬁber concentrations came from, but these references are in Italian and thus could not be
assessed for their usage of PCM or TEM by the QC team. However, in the discussion
section the authors state that the "information on airbone asbestos ﬁber concentration
in Casale Monferrato were presented by Maule et al and are only sumarised here." The
cited reference speciﬁes that "ﬁbers were counted on transmission electron microscope
(TEM, detection limit not provided) and were identiﬁed by EDXA" (Maule et al., 2007,
HERO ID: 3089896). However, other analyses from the Maule paper indicate that SEM
was used for some years and TEM in other years - it is not entirely clear which mea-
surements were used in the present analysis, although it may be reasonably assumed that
both were used for their respective years. The other sources of data, that were unable to
be retrieved in English, appear to be ﬁber measurements from the Balangero asbestos
mine, asbestos cement production, asbestos-textile works, and production of brake and
clutch linings.To assign exposure to individuals, asbestos exposure was assessed without
knowledge of case/control status. The assessment took into account the whole exposure
experience of each individual, including occupational and non-occupational sources
(environmental, familial, domestic). Individuals with multiple potential sources of oc-
cupational exposure were looked at separately. Study raters assessed the probability,
frequency, intensity, and duration of exposure for each potential source for each indi-
vidual based on existing literature and the subject’s interview results in order to assign
an index value in ﬁber-ml years. There is some potential recall bias due to information
coming from personal interviews rather than company records. This is a larger concern
for the 46% of cases for whom interviews were conducted with close relatives rather
than the actual subject who may not know the exact tasks subjects performed on the job.
However, among participants who were directly interviewed recall bias is unlikely to
be signiﬁcantly differential by outcome status. To account for the potential recall bias
among "proxy" interviewees, whether or not interviews were conducted with the actual
subject was an adjustment factor in statistical analysis.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range and distribution of exposure is sufﬁcient or adequate to develop an exposure-
response estimate. Exposure was occupational or non-occupational and determined in
ﬁbers/mL-years. Groups were <0.1,0.1"<1,1"<10, or10. Mean and range of
ﬁbre/mL-years are reported in Table 2.

Metric 6: Temporality High There is an appropriate consideration of latency in this case-control study, as this study
was designed to assess outcomes 20 years after cessation of the industrial activity that
was responsible for asbestos exposure. Duration of exposure ranges are not provided for
the total population, but subjects with <1 f/mL year exposure had a mean of 28 years of
exposure (SD 17) and subjects with >=10 f/mL year exposure had a mean of 53 years
(SD 17) of exposure.
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationHigh The study only included cases of pleural malignant mesothelioma with diagnosis con-
ﬁrmed after examination of histological and/or cytological samples, identiﬁed through
active search in the area referral hospitals.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium All of the study’s ﬁndings that are discussed in the methods are clearly presented in
the results. However, p-values are not presented in the paper but are mentioned in the
abstract.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium Analyses were conducted using unconditional logistic regression models adjusting for
gender, age at diagnosis and type of interview (direct or proxy respondents). There is no
discussion of why those speciﬁc variables were chosen and not others.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization High Potential confounders were assessed using standardized questionnaires that were com-
pleted in interviews by trained professionals (residence at interview, no mention of other
confounders).
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low Potential co-exposures in occupational settings are otherwise not discussed.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The study used unconditional logistic regression modeling to assess differences in PMM
diagnosis between cases and controls, which is an appropriate design.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The ﬁnal sample consisted of 548 individuals (200 cases and 348 controls), which is suf-
ﬁciently large to detect an effect. The authors do not calculate overall statistical power,
but mention using a 1:4 case:control ratio in younger cases to increase power.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Low Exposure estimation processes are not clearly deﬁned, and would be difﬁcult to repro-
duce given access to the analytic data. Other aspects of the study are well-described.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium Unconditional logistic regression modeling was used to calculate odds ratios and ratio-
nale around variables that were included were transparent.

Additional Comments: Case-control study with 300 pleural malignant mesothelioma (PMM) cases and 348 controls. Asbestos type in this study is speciﬁc to ’amphibole’
but another methods paper that was referenced in methods ((Maule et al., 2007, 3089896) discusses chrysotile and crocidolite, so those were included.
Exposure was for occupational and non-occupational populations. Methods around the measurement of exposure and duration of exposure are unclear,
although another study was referenced in the methodology for measuring ﬁbers which cited TEM, however since non-occupational exposed cases exposure
was not measured with TEM, Metric 4 was rated as Medium despite the large amount of uncertainty. The authors observed signiﬁcant associations between
asbestos exposure and odds of PMM.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low This metric is rated Low because the study or any cited methods source does not ex-
plicitly mention the use of PCM or TEM.The estimated average cumulative exposure of
the production workers was about 60 ﬁber-years/mL (chrysotile and crocidolite). The
estimated mean cumulative exposure within the board shop, in which chrysotile was the
sole asbestos type utilized, was 39 f-y/mL. Air sampling data from government, insur-
ance and company hygienists initiated in late 1969 were utilized along with company
employment records to classify each production worker (n=186) according to estimated
annual cumulative asbestos exposure as described within Finkelstein et al., 1983 (HERO
ID 3100548), which also referenced Finkelstein, 1982 (HERO ID 76). Microscopic
method of ﬁber analysis (PCM or TEM) was not detailed in main or referenced text. Air
sampling data was obtained from only later factory years (late 1969 onward) and was
not representative of earlier years, although assumptions for exposure levels for those
earlier years were supported by impinger area sampling data. Air sampling data from
government, insurance and company hygienists initiated in late 1969 were utilized along
with company employment records to classify each production worker (n=186) accord-
ing to estimated annual cumulative asbestos exposure as described within Finkelstein
et al., 1983 (HERO ID 3100548) and Finkelstein, 1982 (HERO ID 76). Eighteen-year
cumulative exposures were calculated for the production workers (Table 7) by combin-
ing work histories and exposure estimates, with job-related exposures multiplied by the
time spent at each job and summed over the 18 years from ﬁrst exposure. Workers were
assigned to an exposure category according to their 18-year exposure totals. Exposures
were assumed to have been unchanged from 1962 to 1970, to have been 30% higher
from 1955 to 1961, and to have been twice as high from 1948 to 1954, with assumptions
supported by impinger area sampling performed 1949 through the 1960"s. Raw mate-
rials in the production worker pipe manufacturing process included cement, silica and
both chrysotile and crocidolite asbestos, while the asbestos cement board production
utilized chrysotile asbestos only. Comparison control workers were primarily within the
rock wool/ﬁberglass insulation production area, although authors noted it was possible
for employees to be assigned to the pipe shop for brief clean-up duties, or re-assigned
from non-asbestos to asbestos work areas, such that some control workers were exposed
as well. Exposures for maintenance workers were not calculated due to inadequate data.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range and distribution of asbestos exposure in Table 7 presented across ﬁve expo-
sure categories ranging from <=30 ﬁber-years/mL through >150 ﬁber-years/mL for
production workers is sufﬁcient to develop an exposure-response estimate.

Additional Comments: QC was not completed for metrics other than Metrics 4 and 5 because the study does not have sufﬁcient exposure information to be useful for dose-response
analysisNOTE: this study was not evaluated for any metrics except Metric 4 and 5 and had no data extracted because it did not have sufﬁcient exposure
information to be useful for dose-response analysis. Within this retrospective cohort study, mortality among asbestos exposed (n=535, production and
maintenance workers) and control (n=205) male employees (total n=740) of an asbestos cement pipe manufacturing factory with a minimum of one year
employment who had been hired prior to 1960 was compared with mortality of the Ontario, Canada male general population over a period of 10 to 34 years
of follow-up. Workers were divided into three groups for study: production workers involved in asbestos cement pipe manufacture, maintenance workers,
and those involved in rock wool and ﬁberglass insulation or other minimal exposure areas who were classiﬁed as non-exposed controls. Factory production
of asbestos cement pipe in one shed and rock wool (later ﬁberglass) insulation in another shed began in 1948, and asbestos cement board was produced in
a separate building from 1955 to 1970. Air sampling data from government, insurance and company hygienists initiated in late 1969 were utilized along
with company employment records to classify each production worker (n=186) according to estimated annual cumulative asbestos exposure. Air sampling
data was obtained from only later factory years (late 1969 onward) and was not representative of earlier years, although assumptions for exposure levels for
those earlier years were supported by impinger area sampling data. In the period 20 years from ﬁrst exposure, the production workers had a standardized
mortality ratio of 181 for all causes of death, 320 for non-malignant respiratory disease, and 58 for ischemic heart disease.
?No biomarkers were identiﬁed for this evaluation.
??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation
Including Legacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos , to be considered as being informative for dose-response analysis, Metrics 4 and 5 would need metric ratings of Medium
or High. This reference did not satisfy this requirement; therefore a data quality evaluation was not conducted.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Key elements of the study design were reported within this retrospective cohort study
of long-term male workers in which n=339 male asbestos workers hired prior to 1960
and employed by the same company in Ontario, Canada for at least nine years were
followed until 31 October 1980 for mortality outcomes of interest. An additional n=11
men (3.2% of the total) could not be properly classiﬁed from their work histories as
production, maintenance or rock wool/ﬁberglass workers and were excluded from the
current analysis. Participants were identiﬁed from company records of all hourly and
salaried employees who had worked at the plant of interest. Employees were excluded
if they did not work for at least nine years to account for the long latency of asbestos-
related diseases and difﬁculties of tracing short-term employees. There is no evidence
to suggest inclusion or exclusion from the sample differed signiﬁcantly by outcome or
exposure status.
Metric 2: Attrition Low Ofﬁcial death certiﬁcates were obtained for all men who had died. However, a total of
ﬁve (2.7% ) of the n=186 production workers, three (5.5% ) of the n=55 maintenance
workers and ﬁve (5.7% ) of the n=87 unexposed or minimally exposed workers were
unable to be traced for mortality outcomes and were assumed still alive for analysis. A
group of 55 maintenance workers were originally included, but later excluded as the
study reported that it "was not thought possible to estimate exposures for the mainte-
nance men."

Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium Inclusion criteria and methods of participant selection were reported. Workers within
the rock wool/ﬁber glass operations (n=87) were classiﬁed as minimally exposed, had
mortality described as similar to the general male Ontario population and were utilized
as the comparison control workers. SMR analyses results utilized the age and calendar
speciﬁc mortality experience of the male Ontario general population as a comparison
group for expected mortality rates. The mean age at the start of exposure or employment
was described as similar between the exposed and general populations. Comparison
control workers were primarily within the rock wool/ﬁberglass insulation production
area, although the author of the current study noted in another publication (Finkelstein
et al., 1983, HERO ID 3083612) of workers in the same factory that it was possible
for employees to be assigned to the pipe shop for brief clean-up duties, or re-assigned
from non-asbestos to asbestos work areas, such that some control workers may have
been exposed as well. There is potential for healthy worker effect in terms of left trunca-
tion bias, as the cohort for the current study was restricted to workers with at least nine
years of employment, such that all workers had to survive for at least nine years to be in-
cluded. However, Table 2 SMR results for non-malignant respiratory disease indicate no
evidence of healthy worker effect in terms of the healthy hire or healthy worker survivor
effect.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium The microscopic method (PCM or TEM) of analysis of air sampling data reported in
Table 1 with outcome mortality rates was not detailed. The average estimated cumula-
tive exposure among production workers was reported for three groups of production
workers of 62 men each as 44 f-y/ml, 92 f-y/ml, and 180 f-y/mL (chrysotile and cro-
cidolite). Groups were created on the basis of ranking 18-year cumulative exposures.
Air sampling data from government, insurance and company hygienists initiated in late
1969 was utilized along with company employment records to classify each production
worker"s exposure, however production within the plant began in 1948 and measured
exposures for periods 1948-1970 were lacking and assumed as related to the quantita-
tive measurements made beginning in 1969. Exposures for maintenance workers was
described as not calculated due to inadequate data. Estimated cumulative exposure for
only the ﬁrst 18 years of employment was utilized such that for men employed less than
18 years this parameter was used and for men employed more than 18 years, the po-
tential exposures after 18 years were excluded. Exposures were assumed to have been
unchanged from 1962 to 1970, to have been 30% higher from 1955 to 1961, and to have
been twice as high from 1948 to 1954, with assumptions supported by impinger area
sampling performed 1949 through the 1960"s. Based on subsequent discussion and
review of additional information, the rating was adjusted based on impinger data was
collected and personal membrane sampling was conducted beginning in late 1969 and
detailed employment records were used to construct exposure histories.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range and distribution of estimated exposures is reported within Table 1 for pro-
duction workers as 8 to 420 ﬁber-years/mL. Table 1 provides the mortality rates for
production workers across three groups of exposure categories.
Metric 6: Temporality High The study presents an appropriate temporality and the interval between exposure and
outcome is appropriate considering the latency of disease. Workers were required to
have been hired before 1960 and were followed up until 1980, ensuring at least 20 years
of follow-up for the cohort.
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationMedium Workers were followed up until 31 October 1980, and as such only pre-ICD 10 coding
was utilized as indicated for ICD codes reported in ofﬁcial death certiﬁcate data ob-
tained for all deaths in Table 2. Additional clinical, pathological and necropsy reports
were available for n=44 of the n=58 deaths among production workers.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium There were no concerns for selective reporting. SMR"s in Table 2 and mortality rates
across age and time since ﬁrst exposure groups per man years in production workers
in Table 3 were reported as single values, with no measures of variation or conﬁdence
intervals. Conﬁdence intervals for speciﬁc outcomes were reported within the text.

Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium Other than stratiﬁcation for years since ﬁrst exposure and age, no additional adjustments
or consideration for differences between exposed and non-exposed groups regarding
distributions of relevant covariates were detailed. The cohort for study was restricted
to males. The authors mention that information for smoking was available for 70% of
the cohort, but this information is not used in statistical analyses. The authors state that
data was available for 9 of 11 men who had died of mesothelioma: 2 never smoked, 2
had quit for 10 or more years, and 5 were smokers. Based on subsequent discussion and
review of additional information, the rating was adjusted based on stratiﬁcation by age
and only males being included in the study.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium Finkelstein, 1982 provides evidence of detailed personnel ﬁles use for TSFE, age, job
history, etc.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding N/A This metric is not applicable for mesothelioma.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The study design was appropriate as an early study to address the research aims. Two
types of comparisons were performed, internal and external. Table 2 SMR results were
obtained through external comparisons by applying the Ontario general population mor-
tality rates as reference and presented for production, maintenance and control workers.
Table 3 mortality rate results were presented for production workers stratiﬁed across age
and years since ﬁrst exposure groups. Tests for trend were not reported.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The number of participants was adequate, however formal statistical comparisons be-
tween exposed and non-exposed workers, or across time since ﬁrst exposure groups,
were not presented. SMR results in Table 2 were reported for the n=328 workers, while
results in Table 3 were reported only for the n=186 production workers.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The data are presented in Table 1 that were used used in the 1986 analysis. Reporting
errors are present in Table 2, but these data are not used in the 1986 analysis.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium Model building was not conducted. The construction of SMRs appears appropriate.
Additional Comments: This was an occupational retrospective cohort study reporting SMRs of long-term male workers in which n=339 male asbestos workers hired prior to 1960
and employed by the same company in Ontario, Canada for at least nine years were followed until 31 October 1980 for mortality outcomes of interest.
Concerns included the assumption that workers unable to be traced for mortality outcomes were still alive at the end of follow-up, with no sensitivity
analyses conducted to examine results with and without these workers. Mesothelioma mortality was obtained utilizing pre-ICD 10 coding. Exposure
concentrations are provided for three groups of exposure in relation to a reference population of Ontario men by outcome - however, no statistical analysis
is done to compare mortality using exposure concentration data, limiting the study’s usefulness for dose-response analysis.

reporting exposure, extrapolations were needed for missing time frames (Finkelstein,
1982, HEROID: 76).Authors described the following for calculation expose and dose
estimation: "Cumulative exposures were calculated for each man by summing annual
exposures accumulated during the ﬁrst 18 years from the start of exposure. Asbestos
dosages were calculated by assuming that a ﬁxed proportion of the workplace air con-
centrations were deposited in the lungs, and each year’s accumulation was weighted by
the residence time in lung tissue (the formulas used are given in the appendix). Cumula-
tive exposures had been estimated to be accurate to within a factor of 3 to 5."
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The distribution of exposure appears to be sufﬁcient to develop an exposure-response
estimate. Cumulative exposure (f-y/ml) and dose (f/ml*yr-squared) for calculating cu-
mulative risk were utilized in statistical models. Range or other measure distribution is
not present in this paper, however Figure 3 shows values ranging from 0-6,500 ﬁbers/mL
x year^ 2.
Additional Comments: Finklestein et al, 1985 709685 was not evaluated for any metrics except Metric 4 and 5 and had no data extracted because it did not have sufﬁcient exposure
information to be useful for dose-response analysis. QC was not completed for metrics other than Metrics 4 and 5 because the study does not have sufﬁcient
exposure information to be useful for dose-response analysis.
?No biomarkers were identiﬁed for this evaluation.
??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation
Including Legacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos , to be considered as being informative for dose-response analysis, Metrics 4 and 5 would need metric ratings of Medium
or High. This reference did not satisfy this requirement; therefore a data quality evaluation was not conducted.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low This metric is rated Low. The exposures used to calculate the effect estimates reported
in Table 2 stemmed from data that came from historical records like questionnaires
and clinical documents. Questions about asbestos exposure covered various charac-
teristics including "duration of exposure (for occupational cases only), time since ﬁrst
exposure, source of asbestos exposure (occupational or non-occupational), form of as-
bestos handled (raw, processed or unclear), type of asbestos (crocidolite only or mixed
ﬁbres) and cumulative exposure (for crocidolite only)." Measurements of these char-
acteristics did not suggest the use of PCM or TEM."Additionally, cited methods for
exposure measurement based on historical records reported the following: Armstrong
et al., 1986 3083076 did not use either PCM or TEM. Counting method was with a
Casella long running thermal precipitator."Hansen et al., 1997 2219991 described that
the ﬁrst survey to count ﬁber was in 1966, which was done by an industrial hygienist
using a Casella long running thermal precipitator. All samples examined in this partic-
ular study were analyzed using the standard membrane ﬁlter method. Some exceptions
were surveys in 1984 and 1986 which used SEM, and in 1992 which used TEM. So,
their latest samples were analyzed using TEM. However, the study being evaluated does
not describe estimates in a way to know outcomes based on exposures measured from
1992 and after. Based on Table 1, time since ﬁrst exposure was over 40 years for this
sample of mesothelioma cases so I presume peak exposure for them was way before
1992."Lastly, these papers described methods for those tied to Wittenoom so it’s still
not clear how exposure measurements were conducted for those who reported exposure
unrelated to Wittenoom."Analysis of lung specimens from select cases (n=122) did mea-
sure asbestos ﬁbers via TEM, and estimates are reported in Table 4. However, they were
non-regression and non-SMR.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low Regression analyses only present exposure in terms of "exposed vs. unexposed" and thus
have a limited range of exposure.
Additional Comments: Due to "Low" ratings for both Metric 4 and Metric 5, this study was determined not to be useful for dose-response analysis and thus did not receive a
evaluation.
??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Atmospheric ﬁbre concentrations were made during period 1968-82 by company and
were assigned codes to job ittles to reﬂect levels of probable exposure (table 2). Over
70% of readings are based on use of personal samplers. "For the period before 1968 it
would be reasonable to assume that levels were higher because of less extensive exhaust
ventilation and more direct handling of raw asbestos".
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low "Since 10=970 ﬁbre levels have generally bene low with mean levels under 1 f/ml
throughout factory. Only a few exposures over 2f/ml have been recorded and most mea-
sured concentrations have been under 0.5f/ml."
Additional Comments: Overall, information on the measurement of exposure metric (M4) to assess exposure was limited. Additionally, the exposure levels metric (M5) information
reported was limited to determine exposure-response relationships.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium This study built on a case-control study referred to as the MALCS study (Rake et al.,
2009, HERO ID 733522). Telephone interviews of 622 mesothelioma patients and 1420
population controls in England, Wales, and Scotland were conducted between 2001
and 2006 as part of the MALCS study. Additionally, 420 patients with resected lung
cancer born since 1940 were interviewed as controls for the mesothelioma patients as
part of the present study (Gilham et al., 2015, HERO ID 3077660), though the dates of
these interviews were not speciﬁed.Patients with lung cancer and mesothelioma were
identiﬁed through physicians, nurses, and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) notiﬁca-
tions from 170 hospitals throughout Britain. Detailed selection methods are provided
in the MALCS paper (Rake et al., 2009, HERO ID 733522). In the cited MALCS case-
control study paper, it was reported that the exclusion criteria for both mesothelioma
cases and population controls were: being "physically or mentally unﬁt for interview",
not having access to a telephone, or not speaking English (Rake et al., 2009, HERO ID
733522).The MALCS paper reported "Overall 39% of 1396 notiﬁed mesothelioma pa-
tients (423 too ill or dead, 87 no GP or consultant permission and 31 ineligible or not
traced) and 18% of 2897 controls (169 too ill or dead, 169 no permission, 191 ineligible
or untraced) were not invited for interview. The proportion of those invited who were
interviewed, sometimes after several reminders, consisted of 73% (624 out of 857) of
mesothelioma cases and 60% (1420 out of 2368) of controls. As expected, response
rates in controls were higher in more afﬂuent areas (69% in the top two quintiles of so-
cioeconomic status and 46% in the lowest)." The analysis of lung samples in the present
paper was conducted on mesothelioma patients and lung cancer patients, but not the
population controls from the MALCS study. The present paper (Gilham et al., 2015,
HERO ID 3077660) reported that written informed consent was obtained from 346 (77%
) patients with mesothelioma and their next of kin for postmortem samples to be ana-
lyzed and from 406 (96% ) patients with lung cancer for analysis of resected tissue."
Thus, although some elements were not present, the available information does not indi-
cate substantial risk of selection bias.

Metric 2: Attrition Medium The authors reported that "written informed consent was obtained from 346 (77% ) pa-
tients with mesothelioma and their next of kin for postmortem samples to be analyzed
and from 406 (96% ) patients with lung cancer for analysis of resected tissue." The use
of postmortem samples for mesothelioma patients indicates that the analyses could not
include samples from mesothelioma patients who were still alive. The use of resected
tissue for lung cancer patients implies that the lung cancer patients may have been alive
at the time of sample collection. The authors reported that samples were analyzed as
they became available, such that transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was per-
formed on 133 mesothelioma samples and 262 lung cancer samples. All of the analyzed
samples were from patients born since 1940, with the exception of 11 female mesothe-
lioma patients born between 1925-1939, who were excluded from most of the analyses.
Thus, lung samples were analyzed for 133/346 (38% ) of the mesothelioma patients and
262/406 (65% ) of the lung cancer patients for whom consent was obtained. Thus, there
was at least moderate exclusion from the analysis sample.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium The authors selected lung cancer patients as the control group for mesothelioma pa-
tients because "resected lung cancers provide the only adequate national source of lung
samples in people who can be identiﬁed systematically, are available for interview and
have an age distribution similar to mesothelioma. Only a small proportion of all lung
cancers are caused by asbestos, so the asbestos lung burdens of this national sample are
reasonably representative of the general population except for a few per cent with very
high burdens."The cited MALCS study indicated that information obtained via interview
included smoking histories and potential environmental exposures (Rake et al., 2009,
HERO ID 733522), but it is unclear whether the mesothelioma patients and the lung
cancer patients differed on these variables. The statistical analyses adjusted for period
of birth and sex, although neither was statistically signiﬁcant. Several analyses were
restricted to only males due to the small number of females.In addition to comparison
of mesothelioma cases to lung cancer cases, "the lifetime risk (probability of dying by
age 90) was calculated actuarially in each lung burden category assuming current (2013)
UK rates for all other causes of death. These lifetime risks were standardized to the
projected probabilities of dying by age 90 for mesothelioma (0.86% ) and lung cancer
(4.67% ) of all British men born in 1945." SMRs in each lung burden category were de-
termined "for the cohort of British men whose central date of birth is the beginning of
1945, (The median date of birth of our mesothelioma cases was September 1944.)"Thus,
information about some demographic and exposure variables was not available to com-
pare between groups. For example, race was not mentioned. However, age and sex were
addressed in the analyses.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Lifetime occupational history was obtained from telephone interviews of 622 mesothe-
lioma patients, 1420 population controls, and 420 patients with resected lung cancer.
Then "job titles were assigned to Standard Occupational Classiﬁcation 1990 (SOC 90)
and Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation 1992 (SIC 92) codes and grouped into main job
categories" (Gilham et al., 2015, 733522). The authors reported that "subjects were as-
signed to the highest-ranking occupation they had worked in irrespective of duration".
Thus, although lifetime work history was obtained, the assignment of occupation was
based on only a portion of this history.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was
used to analyze 133 post-mortem lung tissue samples from a subset of the mesothelioma
patients and 262 resected lung tissue samples from a subset of the lung cancer patients.
The authors reported that "lung samples were anonymized and sent to the Health and
Safety Laboratory (HSL) for TEM counting of asbestos ﬁbers longer than 5 um."Lung
tissue samples were analyzed as they became available. Because tissue samples, but
not environmental samples, were analyzed, the samples were only analyzed at one time
point for each individual, but this time point is representative of cumulative asbestos
lung ﬁber burden.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range and distribution of exposure, expressed as million ﬁbers longer than 5 um per
dry gram (mf/g) asbestos lung burden and displayed in Table 1, was sufﬁcient to develop
an exposure-response relationship, as shown in Figure 2.
Metric 6: Temporality Low The exposure measurement of asbestos burden in lung tissue occurred post-mortem
for mesothelioma patients. Since the diagnosis of these patients was determined while
they were alive, the exposure measurement was obtained after the outcome measure-
ment. However, the study also included occupational history data, which indicates oc-
cupational exposures that occurred before death from mesothelioma. Some possibility
remains that some of the ﬁber accumulation that was assessed after death could have
occurred after disease development. Therefore, the temporality of exposure and outcome
is uncertain.
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationHigh The authors state that lung cancer and mesothelioma patients were "identiﬁed through
chest physicians, lung cancer nurse specialists and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)"
from 170 hospitals throughout Britain (Gilham et al., 2015, HERO ID 733522). The
MALCS study methods paper says that "histological conﬁrmation was obtained for 92%
of interviewedmesothelioma cases" (Rake et al., 2009, HERO ID 733522).

Domain Metric Rating Comments
Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium Mesothelioma ﬁndings are reported throughout the paper. Some of the estimates are
reported with conﬁdence intervals, such as in Table 1, while others are not, such as in
Table 3 (Gilham et al., 2015, HERO ID 3077660).
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium The analyses adjusted for sex and age but did not adjust for race. In Table 1, the odds
ratios are adjusted for sex and period of birth (1940-1944, 1945-1949, 1950-1954, and
1955+), although neither was statistically signiﬁcant.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium Although the authors did not discuss whether the questionnaires used to interview par-
ticipants were validated, there is no evidence to suggest any concerns about the validity
of the method. It is unlikely that the participants would have incorrectly reported sex or
age.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding N/A The assessment of potential co-exposures was not necessary for mesothelioma because
there are few other causes of mesothelioma.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The study design used appropriate statistical methods including odds ratios and logistic
regression for case-control analyses, and SMR for comparison to the British population.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium Although the authors did not provide an explicit discussion of power, there was an ad-
equate number of participants such that an association was observed between asbestos
lung burden and mesothelioma.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The analyses were described in sufﬁcient detail in the paper and in "Appendix 1: Statis-
tical Methods" (Gilham et al., 2015, 3077660).
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium Although some details could have been explained better, the methods for calculating the
risk estimates were sufﬁciently transparent.
Domain 6: Other (if applicable) Considerations for Biomarker Selection and Measurement (Lakind et al. 2014)
Metric 16: Use of Biomarker of Exposure High This study asbestos used ﬁber concentrations in lung tissue samples as a biomarker of
asbestos exposure, which has a clear relationship with target dose. Transmission elec-
tron microscopy (TEM) was used to measure this biomarker. In the lung cancer and
mesothelioma lung tissue samples assessed in this study, 75% of the counted ﬁbers were
amosite, 18% were crocidolite, 1.9% were chrysotile, 1 % were tremolite, 2 % were
anthophyllite, 0.6% were actinolite, and 1.7% were uncharacterized amphiboles. Thus,
several different ﬁber types were identiﬁed in this study because TEM can distinguish
between ﬁber types, thus determining speciﬁc biomarkers of exposure (ﬁber concentra-
tions in lung tissue) for each speciﬁc ﬁber type.

Metric 17: Effect Biomarker N/A The only biomarkers assessed were biomarkers of exposure. Biomarkers of effect were
not assessed.
Metric 18: Method Sensitivity Medium As described in Appendix 2, the analytical sensitivity for ﬁber counts was 0.01 million
ﬁbers per dry gram. Only 2.8% of all samples, and 2/133 mesothelioma samples, did
not achieve this sensitivity due to low ﬁber concentrations and high amounts of other
particles. The sensitivity was later increased to 0.003 mf/g by using newer equipment
for a selected subgroup of samples.
Metric 19: Biomarker Stability Low All lung tissue samples were sent to a pathology laboratory in Leeds for an initial as-
sessment and preparation and then were sent to the Health and Safety Laboratory (HSL)
for TEM analysis. Speciﬁc preparation for storage and transport was not detailed,
though it was mentioned that blocks were waxed and de-waxed. The authors did not
speciﬁcally discuss the stability of the biomarker.
Metric 20: Sample Contamination High The authors detail that "new disposable containers and ﬁltration equipment were used
for each sample to avoid cross-contamination and a process blank was run with each
batch of analyses" (Gilham et al., 2015, 3077660)
Metric 21: Method Requirements High The use of transmission electron microscopy enabled appropriate identiﬁcation and
quantiﬁcation of asbestos ﬁbers in the samples.
Metric 22: Matrix Adjustment N/A Matrix adjustment is not required for assessment of this biomarker.
Additional Comments: This study built on the MALCS case-control study by comparing asbestos lung burden in a subset of the mesothelioma patients from the MALCS study
to that of a sample of patients with lung cancer. The study also assessed SMR in comparison to the British male population born in 1945. The strengths
of the study include the use of transmission electron microscopy for the quantiﬁcation of asbestos ﬁbers in lung tissue samples, and description of details
pertaining to method sensitivity and statistical methods. There were some limitations due to the comparison groups used (lung cancer cases and the British
male general population born in 1945). Some methodological details were unclear or were not described in sufﬁcient detail. For example, the authors stated
that consent was obtained for postmortem samples from mesothelioma patients and resected tissue from lung cancer patients. It is unclear what proportion
of the lung cancer patients were alive at the time of sampling, or why the number of samples analyzed was substantially lower than the number of consent
forms received.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Asbestos exposure was assessed via personal sampling during brake repair in bus
garages in 1987, which was then used to reconstruct earlier exposure conditions. The
study cited as a reference to the method for reconstruction is listed as "unpublished
data", but other sources were used to estimate the exposure to asbestos. The authors also
report that intensity of exposure was assessed "speciﬁc for workplace, work task, and
calendar-time period by industrial hygienists in a job-exposure matrix," (document page
348) although those methods are not described in detail.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Exposure concentrations were reported as weighted annual mean exposures and were
classiﬁed on a scale of three degrees : 0, 1 (0.08 ﬁbres/ml of air), and 2 (0.16 ﬁbres/ml
of air), which provides a low contrast. However, cumulative exposure is calculated as
indices by multiplying the exposure level by the duration in years for every work period
in the work history, resulting in an asbestos exposure score range of 0 to greater than 60.
Additional Comments: Since this study lacks an individual assessment of mesothelioma, it is uninformative.
?No biomarkers were identiﬁed for this evaluation.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Estimates of asbestos exposure were obtained from breathing zone samples conducted in
1971 and 1975. Details on the sampling method were minimal. Other time periods were
not sampled, but industrial hygienists estimated job- and department-speciﬁc . Time-
weighted averages were assumed to be 40% lower after 1969 compared to prior years.
Cumulative exposure was determined by adding years of exposure.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low For cancer mortality, SMRs were calculated without stratiﬁcation, indicating two levels
of exposure (exposed and unexposed).
Additional Comments: This study utilized an occupational cohort to examine the relative mortality rates for mesothelioma compared to the general population. SMRs calculated
for mesothelioma were not speciﬁc to mesothelioma, including other lung cancer mortality. As a result, the results are difﬁcult to interpret for mesothelioma
alone.
?No biomarkers were identiﬁed for this evaluation.
??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation
Including Legacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos , to be considered as being informative for dose-response analysis, Metrics 4 and 5 would need metric ratings of Medium
or High. This reference did not satisfy this requirement; therefore a data quality evaluation was not conducted.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium As detailed in Hansen et al. 1998, 709618, the Wittenoom residents" cohort recruited
all individuals who: (i) lived in Wittenoom for 1 month between 1943 and 1993 and
(ii) had not been employed in the asbestos industry. Cohort size varied slightly with
updates over time, including 4,768 participants (2608 women, 2160 men) at the end of
2000 (Reid 2008 709466; Reid 2006 709501). Members were identiﬁed using multiple
sources to identiﬁcation of former residents (e.g., doctors/hospitals, schools, vitamin A
trial participants, former asbestos workers), but inclusion rates cannot be determined.
The authors reduced the likelihood of "healthy resident" bias by including persons with
only 1 month of residence over a wide span of time. However, by 1993 when 27 cases
had been identiﬁed in residents, 17 additional mesotheliomas were identiﬁed among
individuals who resided in Wittenoom for less than one month. Although suggests that
exposure durations of less than one month are relevant, according to the authors, all of
these cases had reportedly worked with asbestos and likely had more intense exposure
(Hansen et al 1998 709618). The authors did not discuss the number of non-workers
identiﬁed who resided at Wittenoom for less than one month.
Metric 2: Attrition Medium In Hansen et al 1998 (709618), about 29% of the cohort could not be traced. The re-
maining studies, published after 2000, reported 20% loss to follow-up (e.g., Reid 2018
6869529). The extent to which this attrition may be selective is not known, since char-
acteristics of untraced subjects (e.g., age, sex) were not described. However, the authors
partially addressed attrition bias at the analysis stage in several papers (Reid et al. 2012,
2088306; Reid et al. 2018, 6869529) by comparing the impact of different censoring as-
sumptions for subjects lost to follow-up. Alternative analyses assumed these persons: (i)
were all still alive until censored at age 85y; vs. (ii) were eligible to contribute person-
years until the last date their status or age 85y. The ﬁrst method likely overestimates and
the second underestimates person-years at risk.

Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium Within-cohort analyses were used to estimate associations between mesothelioma and
exposure. Analysis samples included all identiﬁed eligible residents, avoiding bias
due to questionnaire non-response (47% non-response reported in Hansen et al. 1998,
709618). Because a high proportion (41% ) of the cohort identiﬁed from doctors, hos-
pitals, and schools or a vitamin A trial (14% ) there may have been some bias in favor
of including less healthy short-term residents (Reid et al., 2008 709466; Hansen et al.
1998, 709618). Western Australia data was used as a referent for SMRs; the authors
described ascertainment as almost complete (Reid et al., 2007, 2088306). Expected mor-
tality for 1950-1969 was extrapolated from 1970-74 as period speciﬁc rates were not
available.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Residential exposure estimates were based on a series of ﬁber measures initiated in 1966
(Hansen et al. 1997, 2219991). A 1966 value of 0.5 f/mL was based on measures taken
prior to the mill/mine closure in 1966 (0.5 f/mL), and subsequent values were interpo-
lated through 1992 using measures from personal and/or ﬁxed monitors: 1973 (median
0.22 f/mL), 1977, and 1978 using PCM counts; 1984 and 1986 using scanning elec-
tron microscopy (SEM); and 1992 using TEM. The 1966 outdoor ﬁber samples were
recounted in 1986 using PCM and updated guidelines according to Rogers and Major
2002 (3080506). Since 1948-1966 measures (1948-1966) were of dust by konimeter,
intensity prior to the 1958 new mill was extrapolated as 1.0 f/mL based on estimates
that the exposure was halved (Hansen 2219991). Concerns include the limited num-
ber, location, and quality of samples, as well as less precise SEM. Cumulative exposure
was calculated based on duration of residence, assuming 24 h a day, 7 d a week expo-
sure. Duration estimates used: (i) detailed mesothelioma registry data; (ii) questionnaire
responses, worker employment dates for relatives, or family member questionnaires
if available; (iii) records at hospitals, schools, etc; and (iv) a value of 6 months if still
unknown. Proportions estimated using each method were not shown. An important
concern is potential for differential measurement error by mesothelioma case status.
Another source of error includes the lack of information on speciﬁc locations and ac-
tivities that would affect individual exposure (only lived with, likely washed clothes of
an asbestos worker were estimated). The most recent study indicated that exposure was
missing for about 5% of the sample (Reid et al. 2018, 6869529).

Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Cumulative exposure (f/mL-years) was analyzed with respect to mesothelioma as a
continuous variable in all 4 papers, and in some studies using 3 or more categories. The
estimated mean (SD) was on the order of 5.5 (8.0) f/mL year (Reid et al. 2007, 709501).
Variability was adequate overall and in sub-group analyses (e.g., in individuals exposed
as children median [IQR] = 3.3 [1.4-7.5], range 0.1 to 64.4; Reid et al., 2012 2088306).
Metric 6: Temporality High All analyses had appropriate sequencing and lengthy follow-up. In the earliest analysis
with follow-up through 1993 (Hansen et al. 1998, 709618), only 12.5% of the cohort
had a lag of less than 20 years since ﬁrst residence at Wittenoom. Subsequent analy-
ses had follow-up through 2002 or later (Reid et al. 2007, 709501). In the most recent
analysis (of mortality through 2014), the mean time since ﬁrst exposure was 51 years in
children and 42 years in adults (Reid et al. 2018, 6869529).
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationMedium Record linkage to ofﬁcial sources was used was used to identify mesotheliomas; link-
age methods were not described. Mesotheliomas were identiﬁed by the Western Aus-
tralia Mesothelioma Registry (part of the regional cancer registry) and the Australian
Mesothelioma Surveillance Programme. ICD codes for mesothelioma were not pro-
vided, but a 2005 Western Australia Cancer Registry report ("Cancer in Western Aus-
tralia: Incidence and mortality 2003 and Mesothelioma 1960-2003") provided tables
indicating that over 95% of mesotheliomas were microscopically conﬁrmed since 1960.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High Results for mesothelioma analyses were presented adequately and appropriately in all
papers.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment High Associations between mesothelioma and cumulative asbestos exposure were adjusted
for age and sex; Hansen et al 1998 709618 also adjusted simultaneously for different
dimensions of exposure. Analyses also included appropriate interaction terms to test the
signiﬁcance of hypothesized differences in gender and age at exposure (e.g., gender x
exposure in Reid et al. 2007, 709501).
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization High Age and sex data was based on records and questionnaires.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding N/A Per mesothelioma-speciﬁc guidance, concern about co-exposures is limited for mesothe-
lioma, meriting a "not applicable" rating.

Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium Analytic methods were appropriate. Hazard ratios or relative risks used Cox regression
models (Reid 2018 6869529, Hansen 1998 709618, Reid 2007 709501), and odds ratios
in an age-matched nested case-control analysis used conditional logistic regression
(Reid et al. 2008, 709466). SMRs/SIRs for mesothelioma were calculated using Western
Australia as an appropriate referent population (Reid et al. 2012, 2088306). To examine
the potential inﬂuence of loss to follow-up on results, some analyses studies compared
alternative censoring methods as described earlier (see Attrition comments).
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium With nearly 5,000 subjects, sample size was adequate overall as well as in analyses of
women (Reid et al. 2008, 709466) and individuals exposed as children (Reid et al. 2018,
6869529). There were a large number of mesothelioma cases (n=27 in the ﬁrst analysis
by Hansen et al. 1998, 709618, n=119 in Reid et al. 2018, 6869529).
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium Descriptions of all analyses were clear and sufﬁcient for reproduction.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium The models and methods used were adequately described for both SMRs/SIRs and
regression models.
Additional Comments: These studies analyzed >5,000 individuals who had lived in Wittenoom, Australia for 1 month from 1943-1993 to evaluate associations between residen-
tial asbestos exposure and mesothelioma (all 4 studies). The cohort excluded asbestos workers. In the most recent study geometric mean (IQR) cumulative
exposure was 3.02 (1.4-7.70) f/mL-years in children and 2.05 (0.90-5.75) f/mL-years in adults, with 119 mesotheliomas identiﬁed by 2014. Increasing ex-
posure was consistently associated with risk of mesothelioma incidence and/or mortality. Though differences narrowed with longer follow-up, individuals
ﬁrst exposed as adults had a higher risk vs. those exposed as children (Reid et al. 2007, 709501 vs. Reid et al. 2018, 6869529). Initial gender differences
were not signiﬁcant after longer follow-up. SMRs for residents exposed as children were signiﬁcantly higher for mesothelioma. Key concerns include
exposure measurement error, particularly prior to 1966 when mining ceased: a single value was extrapolated to the entire period as no ﬁber measures were
taken. Differential measurement error with respect to mesothelioma is a concern, since detailed residential and work histories were available for those
cases, while duration of residence was estimated from limited public records for half of the remaining cohort. There was also a 20% loss to follow-up,
addressed in some studies by comparing different assumptions on the status of these subjects. Associations with mesothelioma remained robust with
differing assumptions.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low "This outcome is rated Low due to the lack of PCM or TEM being used in the
study.Authors refer to a different study for all information regarding to exposure to
asbestos (Hughes et al. 1987, 3583332) That paper notes that air sampling data was col-
lected by a mix of the government, industry, and insurance companies with a midget
impinger (recorded in millions of particles per cubic foot(mppcf)). This was done from
the 1950s-1960s. Membrane ﬁlter sampling (measured in ﬁbers per milliliter) was also
noted to have been carried out starting in 1969. Authors note that because of the em-
ployment population occurring from 1940-1950, all exposure estimates were converted
into mppcf. These air sampling data in combination with job history data were used to
estimate cumulative exposure."
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low SMRs for mesothelioma do not provide results by levels of exposure. Authors only pro-
vide categorical cumulative exposure levels for small opacities ( <25, 25-99, 100-149,
and>=150 mppcf-y) and for lung cancer ( <51, 51-85, 86-121, 122-169, and >=170

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low These studies utilized a job exposure matrix to develop a semi-quantitative measurement
of exposure. Industrial hygienists evaluated the occupational exposure to asbestos, and
allowed for each job period of the subjects to be classiﬁed based on the probability,
frequency, and intensity of asbestos exposure (Iwatsubo et al., 1998, 3081164; Lacourt
et al., 2012, 2569475; Lacourt et al., 2013, 3078290; Lacourt et al., 2014, 3077945;

3081164; Lacourt et al., 2012, 2569475; Lacourt et al., 2013, 3078290; Lacourt et al.,
2014, 3077945; Lacourt et al., 2017, 3863052).
Additional Comments: A complete evaluation of this cohort was not completed because they only utilized a job exposure matrix to semquantitatively determine asbestos exposure
levels. As this was based on professional judgment and did not include TEM or PCM, the metric pertaining to measurement of exposures was rated as
low (Iwatsubo et al., 1998, 3081164; Lacourt et al., 2012, 2569475; Lacourt et al., 2013, 3078290; Lacourt et al., 2014, 3077945; Lacourt et al., 2017,
3863052). Metric ﬁve was rated as high because there were several levels of exposure created in the JEM, representing a range of exposures.
?No biomarkers were identiﬁed for this evaluation.
??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation
Including Legacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos , to be considered as being informative for dose-response analysis, Metrics 4 and 5 would need metric ratings of Medium
or High. This reference did not satisfy this requirement; therefore a data quality evaluation was not conducted.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Individual exposure was not directly measured, but was determined based on a cumula-
tive exposure index (CEI), which was based on job classiﬁcation.It is unclear whether
PCM or TEM or another method was used.Raw materials from 18 asbestos textile
plants were randomly sampled from the 1980s-2010s using X-Ray diffraction, which
determined that the raw materials were chrysotile mixed with other chemical impuri-
ties.Airborne asbestos samples from 1987-2011 from 49 hand-spinning asbestos plants
and 12 hand-spinning from home workplaces were analyzed using a weighting method.
Measurements were taken at a ﬂow rate of 2 L/min for a duration of 15-20 minutes.
Mass concentrations were transformed into ﬁber number concentrations in ﬁbers/ml
using a formula described in a paper that was not found in HERO (Huang J. 1994).
The estimated median concentration of asbestos was 8.0 ﬁbers per milliliter (f/mL) for
hand-spinning at plants and 0.6 f/mL for hand-spinning at home.The study authors cited
several papers in their methods description, some of which were reviewed and were not
found to mention use of PCM or TEM, but at least one methods paper (Huang J. 1994)
wasn’t readily accessible and the method for quantifying ﬁber counts is not fully known
based on the available information.To assess individual exposure levels, participants
were interviewed following a structured questionnaire, which included occupational
history. The occupations and industrial activities of all participants was classiﬁed using
the International Standard Classiﬁcation of Occupation (ISCO) codes and the Interna-
tional Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation (ISIC) codes, respectively. Two experts inde-
pendently assessed exposure probability based on ﬁber concentration measurements
(unclear whether PCM, TEM, or other) and expert judgement. The cumulative exposure
index (CEI) of asbestos was expressed as ﬁbers per milliliter years (f/mL-years) and
was calculated based on the sum of the products of probability, frequency, intensity, and
duration of each job exposure.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range and distribution of exposure is sufﬁcient to develop an exposure-response es-
timate. Table 4 presents odds ratios for malignant mesothelioma stratiﬁed by asbestos
exposure levels. Asbestos exposure categories were deﬁned in several different ways, in-
cluding categorization by cumulative exposure index (CEI). There were three categories
of CEI: >0"0.5, >0.5"29, and >29 ﬁbers per milliliter years (f/mL-years).

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Exposure was estimated utilizing professional judgement of plant concentration with
meteorological data to estimate "relative asbestos concentrations" for the population of
interest and no use of quantitative exposure measures. Authors noted in Supplemental
material that the "relative asbestos concentrations" for the population of interest sur-
rounding the plant were estimated using an assumed ﬁber concentration (professional
judgement) emitted from the plant because actual concentrations and emission rates of
airborne asbestos ﬁbers during the period of interest were unknown. No quantitative
asbestos sampling was reported or utilized within calculations. Authors assumed the
emission point of asbestos was the center of the plant, and airborne asbestos emitted
from the plant was the sole industrial source of exposure.

tion levels divided into ﬁve exposure groups were presented within Figure 3.
Additional Comments: HERO ID 2601091 Kurumatani (2008) was not evaluated for any metrics except Metrics 4 and 5 and had no data extracted because it did not have sufﬁcient

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low The assessment of asbestos exposure was done by two experts who examined the ques-
tionnaires of participants. Occupational exposure was broken down into four parameters,
including probability of exposure, frequency of exposure, intensity of exposure, and
route of exposure (Lacourt et al., 2014, 3078046). There was no indication of actual
tools or instruments used, and only professional judgment was used to estimate expo-
sure. This metric is rated low because the study or any cited methods source does not
explicitly mention the use of PCM or TEM (Lacourt et al., 2014, 3078046).
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The authors reported a range of exposure that is sufﬁcient to develop an exposure-
response estimate. Table 1 presents the groupings for intensity of exposure, which is
reported in f/mL (Lacourt et al., 2014, 3078046).
Additional Comments: Due to the rating for measurement of exposure, this study was not evaluated. Utilization of professional judgment and a job exposure matrix, without actual
quantitative measurement of asbestos ﬁbers, lead to a low rating. However, they did provide several levels of intensity of exposure which was determined
semiquantitatively (Lacourt et al., 2014, 3078046).

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium The current study noted that details regarding case selection were reported within Mc-
donald et al., 2001 (HERO ID 709579). Starting in 1989, approximately 85% of all
respiratory and occupational medicine consultants in the UK voluntarily reported new
cases of occupational respiratory disease to the national Surveillance of Work-related
and Occupational Respiratory Disease (SWORD) study. Eligibility was described as all
cases of malignant mesothelioma reported by physicians to SWORD between 1990 and
1996, born from 1943 onwards; these were selected for study and followed until the end
of 1997. Of the n=180 eligible cases, exclusions were made for n=18 reported twice,
n=14 described as too old, n=5 described as overseas, and n=3 for which diagnosis had
been changed to benign pleural disease, inﬂammatory disease or adenocarcinoma, leav-
ing n=140 men and women suitable for study. Of these, n=11 males and n=1 female
was excluded due to lack of work history, leaving n=115 males and n=13 females for
study. Of these, those without autopsies and lung burden analysis were excluded, leav-
ing n=69 males and n=4 females for study. Final analyses for the current study excluded
the females and was restricted to n=69 male mesothelioma cases. Eligibility for n=57
potential controls was described as those with autopsies from accidental or sudden car-
diac deaths conducted by the same pathologists as cases, matched to cases by age and
geographic region. Distributions of relevant exposure, outcome, demographic and other
variables between those included and excluded were not detailed.
Metric 2: Attrition Medium Exposure and outcome data were complete for selected cases, although n=5 eligible
cases were originally noted as lost to follow-up ("overseas").
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium Key elements of study design were reported (inclusion criteria and methods of partic-
ipant selection) and indicate subjects were recruited during the same time period from
the same eligible population. Differences in all potential confounding variables between
groups were not detailed, although cases and controls were compared across matching
variable categories of age and geographic region in Table 1.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure High Autopsied lung ﬁber burden within mesothelioma cases and controls was measured
utilizing Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM).
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Exposure distribution is adequate for exposure-response analyses. Final regression mod-
els incorporated odds ratios across quartiles of ﬁber concentration per microgram (f/
ug) tissue within autopsied tissue samples including 0.0 f/ug, 0.1-0.9 f/ug, 1.0-9.9 f/ug,
>=10.0 f/ug, as well as linear models utilizing a continuous measure of exposure.

Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationHigh Initial diagnoses were made by respiratory and occupational medicine consultants re-
ferring mesothelioma cases to the original SWORD study. Mcdonald et al., 2001 (ID
709259) indicates that research assistant conﬁrmation of data was obtained from med-
ical records, occupational histories, coroners and subject general practitioners. Formal
validation of diagnoses was made through histological examination of lung tissue and
tumor samples for cases and controls described as conducted independently by two
pathologists considerably experienced in mesothelioma diagnosis.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High There were no concerns for selective reporting as all outcomes which were outlined
within methods were also reported within the results. Effect estimates within Tables
2 and 4 are reported as unadjusted and adjusted Odds Ratios (OR"s) and 95% conﬁ-

Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium Analyses of n=69 mesothelioma cases with n=57 controls was minimal for this matched
case control analyses. Analyses within some higher exposure quartiles across asbestos
types was sometimes not possible due to the lack of cases and/or controls (Tables 2 and
4).
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium Statistical tests and matching variables were described and general methods were de-
scribed in a way that would facilitate reproducibility with access to the analytic data.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection High This was a cross-sectional study design of asbestos ﬁber levels and the risk of mesothe-
lioma mortality. Lung samples from n=78 mesothelioma cases autopsied from 1982-
1983 were collected from registries from nine Canadian provinces. Cases were included
in the study if the pathologist deemed the diagnosis "more likely than not". Lung sam-
ples for deaths not caused by malignant or respiratory disease were collected from the
following years: 1979, 1980, 1981, and half of 1984. These controls (n=78) were se-
lected from the same autopsy register that cases were selected from. Controls were
matched by sex, date of death (within one year), type of tissue, and date of birth. Au-
thors note that British Columbia was excluded from the sample due to an existing study
occurring in the region.
Metric 2: Attrition High Authors report a total of 167 diagnosed mesothelioma cases in the study area during the
sampling period, with only a portion being fatal (n=83) and only 78 samples available.
There is no evidence of further restricting the sample for analyses. As the study was
conducted among subjects whose diseases were fatal, attrition and loss to follow up are
not of concern.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium Authors selected referent population from the same autopsy registry but during slightly
different years (1982 and 1983 for cases; 1979, 1980, 1981, and the ﬁrst half of 1984 for
controls). Controls were matched for sex, date of death, type of tissue, and date of birth.
A full comparison of demographic characteristics of cases and controls is not provided,
thus other demographic differences cannot be completely ruled out.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Fiber levels in lung samples were assessed using analytic TEM to identify short ( <8
um ﬁber length) and long ( >=8 um ﬁber length) ﬁbers. As samples were collected after
subject death, levels only represent one time period, which is anticipated to reasonably
represent the period of interest prior to subject death.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Fiber concentrations ranged from <0.1 to 100 per ug dry weight of lung sample, which
represents a sufﬁcient range to examine the exposure-outcome relationship.
Metric 6: Temporality Medium This study represents a cross-sectional analysis of a disease with a long latency period.
Fiber levels were measured after mesothelioma death, thus it can be assumed that the
latency period was accounted for in the study.

Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium While anticipated results of analyses are reported, the results do not always include all
information needed for dose-response analyses. Odds ratios are reported by ﬁber con-
centration in Table 1 along with case and referent numbers, but no measure of variance
accompanies the effect estimate. Additionally, the risk increment and 95% CI, along
with the attributable risk, are reported, but case and referent numbers are not reported.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium Sex, year of death, type of tissue, and age were appropriately adjusted for using match-
ing of cases and referents. While age and sex are two important confounders, informa-
tion on other potential confounders is not provided, thus limiting the ability to assess is
adjustment was complete.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Low While it could be reasonably assumed that information on confounders was collected
from registries, the source of confounder information is not explicitly stated in the study.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding N/A Per mesothelioma-speciﬁc guidance, concern about co-exposures is limited for mesothe-
lioma, meriting a "not applicable" rating.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium This cross-sectional assessment of the case and referent populations was appropriate,
as was the use of multivariate logistic regression to assess the relationship between the
exposure and outcome.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The number of cases (n=78) and matched referents (n=78) is adequate to detect an effect
in the population.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The information provided about the analysis is sufﬁcient to conceptually reproduce the
approach.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium Authors explicitly provide information about the construction of statistical models and
why certain covariates were included.
Domain 6: Other (if applicable) Considerations for Biomarker Selection and Measurement (Lakind et al. 2014)
Metric 16: Use of Biomarker of Exposure High Lung samples were analyzed to assess the number of asbestos ﬁbers (by type) present
per ug dry weight tissue. Lung tissues are an appropriate matrix to accurately assess
asbestos ﬁber levels.
Metric 17: Effect Biomarker High Lung tissue samples were histologically examined to assess mesothelioma. Lung is an
appropriate matrix to accurately assess this health outcome.

Metric 18: Method Sensitivity Medium LOD<0.01 for ﬁbers appears low enough to capture a wide range of exposure levels to
address the research hypothesis.
Metric 19: Biomarker Stability High Stability and storage losses are not of concern for the lung samples collected in this
study.
Metric 20: Sample Contamination Medium There is no information related to sample contamination, but there are no major con-
cerns about contamination of lung tissue samples with asbestos ﬁbers.
Metric 21: Method Requirements Medium Methods with high degrees of conﬁdence are used to assess biomarkers of effect and of
exposure.
Metric 22: Matrix Adjustment N/A Matrix adjustment was not required for any of the biomarkers assessed in this study.
Additional Comments: This cross-sectional study examines autopsy tissue from deceased mesothelioma patients to assess ﬁber levels and compare those levels to lung tissue from
a deceased referent population. While some information about consideration of confounders and details of results from statistical analyses are limited, the
study reasonably assesses the exposure-outcome relationship through appropriate participant selection, exposure analysis, statistical analysis, and outcome
ascertainment.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Description of study setting was provided, and other elements including inclusion cri-
teria and case ascertainment, primarily from McDonald et al. 1986, HERO ID: 29964,
with McDonald and Armstrong 2003, HERO ID: 709547 giving a briefer version of the
info. The study population includes male workers from a Libby mining company who
have been hired before 1963. In total, 406 males worked at the site for at least one net
year were included, 12 of which were employed before 1940. No other description of
additional inclusion or exclusion criteria. There is limited information on subjects not
included or participation rate, which introduces potential for selection bias.
Metric 2: Attrition High In McDonald et al. 1986, HERO ID: 29964, at the end of the follow-up period (July 1st,
1983), 226 were alive and 165 were dead. 14 men were found alive on 1981 but subse-
quent status was not available. In total, vital status of 405 out of 406 men included in
this study were traced. Death certiﬁcates were obtained for 163 of the 165 deceased. In
McDonald and Armstrong 2003, HERO ID: 709547, at the end of the follow-up period
(July 1st, 1983), the remaining 241 (vs 240 in McDonald et al. 1986, HERO ID: 29964)
known to be alive at the end of the 1983 follow up period were traced via the National
Death Index to 1998, where another 120 were conﬁrmed dead.There is little loss to fol-
low up.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium In McDonald et al. 1986, HERO ID: 29964 mesothelioma case-referent analyses, "con-
trols for each case were chosen as men surviving beyond the age of death of the case,
who had been born and had started work at Libby mine within three years of the case."In
McDonald and Armstrong 2003, HERO ID: 709547, comparison was made among other
workers. Age and sex were considered in the analyses.Thus, there is only indirect evi-
dence that groups are not similar to each other.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Details on exposure assessment are primarily from McDonald et al. 1986, HERO ID:
29964, with McDonald and Armstrong 2003, HERO ID: 709547 citing this paper. The
measurement of exposure (a mix of personal and area) changed during the study period
but was ultimately based employment records and quantitative estimates of exposure
using a combination of midget impingers and PCM (cited as optical microscopy while
referencing Walton 1982, HERO ID: 29649, which clariﬁes it as phase contrast opti-
cal microscopy) for a portion of participant"s work history of exposure, requiring ex-
trapolation for earlier years. Air samples were collected using midget impinger before
1970 and using membrane ﬁlters after 1970. Samples before 1970 only measured dust
concentrations without conversion factors. Limited amount of samples were collected
before 1965, and the measurements were much higher after 1975 when the company
introduced a systematic air sampling program. Authors assumed that ﬁber exposure
measures made before 1965 (engineering controls installed at this point to reduce dust/
ﬁber levels), were a fraction of those measured afterwards. Authors further note: "For
the other operation locations ﬁber measurements were available only for the recent pe-
riods. When the data were considered inadequate to describe past conditions, because
of changes in process or control practice, arbitrary correction factors were applied. This
was done after discussion with the company’s representatives and especially with a pre-
vious manager who had spent almost all his career with Libby and who had extensive
knowledge of the operations." Samples were taken until 1982. Cumulative exposure
levels were calculated based on job histories, operation locations, and estimated aver-
age ﬁber concentrations.In McDonald and Armstrong 2003, HERO ID: 709547, they
used three different indices for exposure: "...(A) average intensity over ﬁrst ﬁve years of
employment (f/ml); (B) cumulative exposure (f/ml.y); and (C) residence weighted cu-
mulative exposure, for which each year"s exposure is weighted according to the number
of years since it was experienced (f/ml.y)."
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium In McDonald et al. 1986, HERO ID: 29964, cumulative continuous exposure levels
were used for case-referent analysis of mesothelioma. In McDonald and Armstrong
2003, HERO ID: 709547, both continuous and categorical exposure levels were used in
Poisson regression analyses for mesothelioma.
Metric 6: Temporality High The follow-up period is greater than 20 years in this cohort for >2/3 of deaths (as shown
in McDonald et al. 1986, HERO ID: 29964), suggesting there is sufﬁcient considera-
tion of latency of mesothelioma. The temporality is established and exposure occurred
before outcome.

Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationHigh In McDonald et al. 1986, HERO ID: 29964, the cases were ascertained from death cer-
tiﬁcates and underlying cause of death was coded by a single qualiﬁed nosologist ac-
cording to ICD-8 codes (163, 199, and 515). In McDonald and Armstrong 2003, HERO
ID: 709547, the additional deaths were coded by State nosologists in ICD-9 (codes not
speciﬁed).
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High Findings of the study were reported in abstract and results. Analyses show relative risk
with 95% CI (McDonald et al. 1986, HERO ID: 29964, McDonald and Armstrong 2003,
HERO ID: 709547). McDonald and Armstrong 2003, HERO ID: 709547 also reports a
p-trend. Reporting bias is not likely to be introduced.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium For case-referent analysis, age, sex, and date of hire were matched (McDonald et al.
1986, HERO ID: 29964), while in McDonald and Armstrong 2003, HERO ID: 709547,
there is no covariate adjustment, except for sex and race.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium The source of covariates were not described but likely collected from employment

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low This metric is rated Low because the study or any cited methods source does not explic-
itly mention the use of PCM or TEM.Authors provided a detailed history of asbestos
work in the plant, but methodology of exposure measurement is limited. Generic dust
measures were available from the 1960s and in 1979, 64 airborne asbestos ﬁber sam-
plings were available (crocidolite speciﬁc). No information is provided regarding how
measures were taken.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The study cohort includes workers hired from 1950-1986, and follow-up is from 1965-
2005. Even though the environmental airborne generic asbestos ﬁber and crocidolite
sampling in different areas in 1979, this study only presented "duration of exposure" that
can be used as a surrogate of exposure assessment for several diseases and to determine
exposure-response relationships.
Additional Comments: NOTE: This study would not be evaluated under the current guidelines. This is due to the low rating for metric 4, as no PCM or TEM was mentioned in
the study or a cited source.This study provides a comprehensive analysis of SMRs from workers in the Bagnoli factory cohort. Overall, the study describes
metrics well, but lacks proper covariables and excluded smoking in their analyses. There is very little information regarding the measurements of asbestos
dusts within the factory, with no mention of what tools were used or measures for non-crocidolite asbestos exposures.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium White soil exposure was assessed both indoors and outdoors (two samples for each
environment) in each village. Inclusion for indoor measurements included white-washed
walls with white soil. Outdoor samples were taken from the center of the village on the
main road. Samples were sent to specialists in the National Institute of Workers Health
and Security (ISGUM), Ankara. A PCM was used to count ﬁbres longer than 5 um. This
has been marked medium as the authors don’t clarify if multiple time periods were used
for measures.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low Levels of exposure are by exposed and unexposed villages and by men and women. As
there are only two levels of exposure, the metric is rated Low.
Additional Comments: HEROID 235159 was not evaluated for any metrics except Metric 4 and 5 and had no data extracted because it did not have sufﬁcient exposure information
to be useful for dose-response analysis. Metric 5 only provided 2 exposure levels, thus receiving a Low rating. Comments can still be found for all metric,
but they are not rated.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Estimated cumulative exposure was described as based upon historical spot measure-
ments analyzed by light microscopy and exposure classiﬁcations assigned to each work
area. Workplace asbestos exposure spot measurement records were available from 1950
until 1981. Each worker was assigned a speciﬁc category of exposure for every year
that worker worked at the asbestos cement factory. Details regarding consideration for
changes in job area or task during that year were not provided. Authors did not discuss
the potential for exposure misclassiﬁcation within these methods, but the misclassi-
ﬁcation was likely non-differential. Mean (IQR) estimated cumulative exposure was
reported in Table 2 as 72.62 ﬁber years (ﬁbers x years/cm^ 3) (70.81).
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low The range and distribution of estimated exposure across ﬁve workplace areas in Table 1
is sufﬁcient to develop exposure-response estimates. Separate mesothelioma mortality
analyses results within Table 4 utilized only binary (yes/no) amphibole exposure as an
exposure predictor variable.

authors were able to obtain 172 of 178 certiﬁcates of death, and there were an additional
130 cases for which the authors obtained clinical, surgical, and pathological data to
supplement death certiﬁcate information.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium The expected number of deaths/illnesses included in this study were derived from the
age-speciﬁc death rate data for white Canadian males. It is important to note that they
did not use data speciﬁc to Quebec, but it is noted that "national rates are not impor-
tantly different from those of Quebec province but are likely to be signiﬁcantly higher
than those of the rural mining counties in which these workers lived" (Nicholson et
al., 1979). The authors also explicitly discuss the potential for healthy worker effect,
but they mention that "the effects of asbestos exposure appear to overcome the bene-
ﬁcial health status usually associated with employability" (Nicholson et al., 1979). As
mentioned, the participants were compared to white Canadian males, but there was no
discussion of the racial makeup of employees.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure High The authors report that 97 air samples were collected from various work locations within
ﬁve operating asbestos mines/mills. These samples were collected between 1973 and
1975, and a majority of them were personal samples. The concentrations varied greatly,
but it is reported that "in virtually all work categories average dust concentrations ex-
ceeded the asbestos standard then current in the United States of 5 ﬁbers longer than 5
micrometers/milliliter (5 f/ml)" (Nicholson et al., 1979). The authors detail that they fol-
lowed the methods outlined by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health
to determine asbestos concentrations, which utilizes a microscope with phase contrast
optics (1972, 145).

Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Multiple levels of asbestos exposure were presented in the study. Table 3 includes a
range, mean, and number of samples of asbestos in each of the mine/mill locations. It is
also further divided into various work areas/activities, including general mill air, bagging
asbestos, quality control laboratory, crusher, dryer, shops, and nonwork areas. This table
highlights that a majority of the cohort was employed in facility two, and concentrations
are reported in ﬁbers longer than 5 micrometers/ml of air.
Metric 6: Temporality High One of the requirements to be included in this study was that the workers must have
been employed for at least 20 years. This means that there is an appropriate temporality
between exposure and outcome such that exposure occurred prior to the outcome.
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationHigh Death certiﬁcates were examined to determine the causes of death of participants. There
was no mention of ICD coding schemes present in this study.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium The ﬁndings are reported at various points throughout the study. Expected and observed
deaths are reported, along with the O/E calculations. However, information such as
conﬁdence intervals are not reported, contributing to the medium rating.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control

founders or their adjustment.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization N/A Covariates were not assessed in this study.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding N/A Because mesothelioma has few other causes than asbestos exposure, this metric was not
rated.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The study design and methods are appropriate for the research question being examined.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium Even though an explicit discussion of power was not included, the number of partici-
pants is adequate to detect an effect.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Low There is a very limited discussion of the analysis presented in this study.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium SMRs were utilized, and it is clear why this analysis method was used.
Additional Comments: This study had some strengths and limitations. One beneﬁt was the temporality component, since one of the inclusion criteria was that employees must have
worked there for at least 20 years, providing a sufﬁcient time from exposure to outcome. There was also an adequate number of participants included in the
study to determine an effect. However, these results could be limited. It would have also been beneﬁcial for the authors to provide more information about
the causes of deaths, such as a discussion about diagnoses or speciﬁc indications, such as through cytological or histological means, for mesothelioma.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low To estimate pre-1970s steam engine maintenance exposures in Finland, working con-
ditions were reconstructed in two workshops with the assistance of workers who had
been exposed. During reconstructed dismantling of the outer covers of the boilers of
two engines, eight personal air samples were collected. The authors state that "asbestos
exposure was measured with standardized techniques," but they don’t specify what these
techniques were. Therefore, it is unclear whether PCM, TEM, or another method was
used. The authors also reported that asbestos concentrations in cabins of diesel locomo-
tives with asbestos pipe insulation was measured.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low The range and distribution of exposure was limited. The authors reported that "the av-
erage number of ﬁbres >5 um was 5.0 (range 2.5-7.5)/cm^ 3, indicating medium expo-
sure" (Nokso-Koivisto & Pukkala, 1994) for the reconstructed steam engine dismantling.
The number of ﬁbers was undetectable for diesel locomotive cabins. Furthermore, al-
though different time periods were assessed, the study only assessed two exposure levels
– standardized incidence ratios were used to compare locomotive drivers (exposed) to
the Finnish population (presumed unexposed or lower exposed). Therefore, this study
does not include sufﬁcient information for dose-response assessment.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low The study employed two job exposure matrices - the DOMJEM (the Netherlands) and
the FINJEM (Finland) - however, only one matrix appears to leverage quantitative mea-
sures of exposure to asbestos, but it is unclear if TEM or PCM were used. It appears
that the DOMJEM uses expert judgment only to assign semiquantitative exposure val-
ues with corresponding weighting. The FINJEM uses expert judgment and exposure
measurement, though there is no discussion of the methodology used to make those
measurements.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium This study examines exposure by tertile of cumulative exposure, tertile of duration of
exposure, and, among the exposed only, tertile of duration of high exposure. Many of
the analyses use those who were not exposed to asbestos as the referent group. There
is an appropriate range of exposure among the study population to assess the exposure-
response relationship.
Additional Comments: This case-cohort study leverages the NLCS cohort to assess the association between occupational asbestos exposure and pleural mesothelioma cases. The
study design and methodological approaches are robust, and the study employed the ICD-O-3 to identify mesothelioma cases. There are no major concerns
about residual bias in the observed results.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium This study is an extended follow up of the same North England asbestos textile factory
worker cohort recruited from the work areas with highest expected asbestos exposure:
ﬁberizing, carding, spinning, weaving, and plaiting. (Knox et al. 1968, HEROID: 115;
Peto et al. 1977, HEROID: 3084525). Here, 679 men who had begun work after 1933
and who had accrued >10 total years of service by 1972 were included in the study.
There is limited detail on recruitment or other inclusion criteria. There may be some
selection bias, as only healthier workers would be able to complete >10 years of work in
select high-exposure areas.
Metric 2: Attrition High Follow up for mortality continued through 1978 by the National Health Central Register
and the factory personnel department. 41 of 679 (6% ) men were unable to be traced.
In this analysis, they were assumed to have been alive at the previous follow up date
(12/31/1974), but their subsequent man-years were not included here. Deaths of workers
over 85 are ignored. There is no other mention of drop-out or loss that was not included
in follow-up.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Low The study only mentions "unaffected controls" in the section on lung cancer mortality
and dust levels. Another study using the same cohort (Knox et al. 1968, HEROID: 115)
notes comparisons to "national rates," however it’s not clear if this is the same compar-
ison group for this study. The study does compare in text results workers ﬁrst exposed
before 1951 and those in 1951 and later (i.e., cohort 1 and 2).
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Asbestos ﬁber exposure concentrations were reportedly measured using a thermal pre-
cipitator in years between 1951-1961. Additional support for understanding past area
dust measures in particles/mL were taken in conversations with hygiene ofﬁcers from
the factory. Static membrane ﬁlters in years after 1961. Authors state that for each area
of the factory, representative combinations of measures were used and averaged to be
converted to modern counting methods. "The revised estimates are based on preliminary
data abstracted from a detailed analysis that is currently being conducted by T.B.A. In-
dustrial Products Ltd and must be regarded as provisional. However, they indicate that
average dust levels were in the region of 30 ﬁbre/ml in 1951 and remained high until
about 10 years ago."
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low Asbestos exposure appears to be continuous, however SMR analyses are stratiﬁed by
years since ﬁrst exposure and year of ﬁrst exposure, not by a quantitative measure of
asbestos exposure. This suggests the exposure for SMR analyses is dichotomous.

Metric 6: Temporality Medium There is appropriate temporality reported ( >10 years) to follow-up to establish
exposure-outcome, however it is not clear what share of workers has longer follow up
time, as only man-years are reported, not total workers by years of service. In the pa-
per on the same cohort published prior to this one, which had more subjects (Peto et al.
1977, HEROID: 3084525), 406/1085 (37% ) of workers had >20 years of service. It
seems reasonable to assume a similar proportion in the current study.
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationMedium No ICD codes were used to establish mortality, except for gastrointestinal cancer, how-
ever no version is explicitly listed. Authors report that follow-up was itself completed by
National Health Central Register (NHCR) and by the factory personnel department.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High Mesothelioma is reported in all parts of study. Rate of pleural mesothelioma mortal-
ity is reported without effect estimates (in tables). Some data is available in text with
conﬁdence limits.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Low Sex is adjusted for based on inclusion of only men. There is brief mention of adjustment
for man-years in the analysis, but no other variables are discussed.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Low Covariate is assumed to have been collected from factory personnel records. No explicit
detail is provided.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding N/A There are no applicable co-exposures for mesothelioma.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The study design is appropriate for measuring relative risk and mortality rates of work-
ers from the textile factory.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The number of subjects (n=679) should be sufﬁcient to ﬁnd any true relationships be-
tween exposure and outcome.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The methods described in the paper are clear enough to be conceptually replicated.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium SMR analyses were appropriate, with no explicit assumptions to be met.
Additional Comments: Asbestos ﬁber types are detailed in an earlier iteration of the current study (Knox et al., 1968, HEROID: 115). There is limited detail on recruitment and
participation methods and rates, as well as how outcomes were ascertained by the National Health Central Register and factory personnel departments.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Low This study examined mesothelioma death rates among current and former 17,800 in-
sulation workers in North America, however this is not entirely certain given how the
study was written. Authors cite a previous work for details (Selikoff et al. 1979), but this
was not available at the time of evaluation. There is no information given on the study
population or its recruitment.
Metric 2: Attrition Low The number of participants were not reported at the different stages of the studies dis-
cussed in the manuscript.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Low The comparison groups belong to different studies (i.e., settings), exposed to different
asbestos ﬁber types in different locations (as suggested by the limited descriptions pro-
vided on Table III). It is uncertain if they belonged to the same eligible population.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Based on additional review of related publications and the 1986 assessment, asbestos
measurements were conducted using stand membrane ﬁlter technique of the US Public
Health Service, presented in Nicholson 1976. Membrane ﬁlters were counted using
PCM.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Based on information presented in the 1986 assessment and Nicholson 1976, cumulative
exposures for workers were determined based on length of work history and asbestos
ﬁber counts presented in Nichols 1976.
Metric 6: Temporality High Selikoff, 1979 presents complete data on years from exposure onset including 35+ years
of follow-up. This study is part of the foundation establishing the latency of effect.

There is indirect evidence that appropriate adjustments were also made, e.g., the foot-
note on p. 130 indicates that the authors made assumptions of white male rates for all
causes of death to adjust the authors "lifelong risk" estimates.

Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The authors used appropriate statistical methods (SMRs, survival relative risk) to report
the distribution of mesothelioma mortality cases by age and years since ﬁrst exposure.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The number of subjects analyzed (n=17,800 for North American insulation workers,
not including other cohorts in thi) is sufﬁciently large to detect the effect in the exposed
population (reporting 236 cases of mesothelioma deaths).
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium Reviewing the relevant information across publications and the 1986 assessment pro-
vides sufﬁcient detail to conceptually understand the analysis.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium Methods for calculating mortality risks are transparent.
Additional Comments: This article is a review. While it may reanalyze or represent analyses of Selikoff et al. 1979, it does not appear to be original data in any way. The
measurement of exposure was uninformative as PCM or TEM were not mentioned, and details about exposure measurements were not provided. Fiber

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection High This study employed a case-control study design. Cases were obtained from the Aus-
tralian Mesothelioma Surveillance Program, which was in place from January 1, 1980 to
December 31, 1985. Notiﬁcations to this program helped the authors obtain participants,
and "voluntary notiﬁcations were sought from clinicians and pathologists throughout
Australia" (Rogers et al., 1991). Cancer registries in each Australian state were exam-
ined for cross-checking purposes. The only individuals allowed into the study were
those with a deﬁnite or probably mesothelioma diagnosis as determined by ﬁve experi-
enced pathologists appointed by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia. There
were 697 total cases with these diagnoses, but only 221 had lung tissue materials avail-
able. This included 209 individuals with a deﬁnite designation, and 12 with a probable
designation.
Metric 2: Attrition High While there were 697 potential participants identiﬁed as having deﬁnite or probable
mesothelioma diagnoses, only 221 cases were included in the analyses because of the
availability of lung tissue samples. The authors mention that "postmortem material from
ﬁve possible cases was also available but was excluded from the current study" (Rogers
et al., 1991). No information was provided as to why these samples were excluded;
however, this represented a minimal level of attrition.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Low This study utilized an unmatched method for obtaining controls. Formalin-preserved
lung tissue was obtained for another study from consecutive autopsies at the Royal
Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney, Australia. These necropsies took place during the
same time period as the cases. Exclusion criteria for these controls included pneumo-
coniosis, emphysema, pneumonia, or gastrointestinal cancer. 359 control samples were
included in this study. They did mention that there was "reasonable frequency matching
for age and sex" (Rogers et al., 1991).

sensitivity was 15,000 ﬁbers/g for light microscopy, and 200,000 ﬁbers/g for TEM. It
is important to note that light microscopy ﬁber counts "were made on all 221 cases and
359 controls. Electron microscopic ﬁber counts, EDAX, and ﬁber length measurements
were made on all 221 cases and 103 male controls, drawn randomly from the total group
of 276" (Rogers et al., 1991). Because these samples were examined in necropsied lung
tissues, ﬁber concentrations were only determined at one point in time.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range of exposures is sufﬁcient to develop an exposure-response estimate.
Metric 6: Temporality Low The temporality of exposure and outcome is uncertain. However, because asbestos con-
centrations were estimated from lung tissue samples, it can reasonably be assumed that
exposure preceded the outcome of mesothelioma.
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationHigh Mesothelioma diagnosis was determined by a panel of ﬁve experienced pathologists,
who were all appointed by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia. Potential
classiﬁcations included deﬁnite, probably, possible, and not mesothelioma based on
histologic classiﬁcation. The scores for determining these classiﬁcations were 1, 0.75,
0.50, and 0, respectively. Only deﬁnite and probably classiﬁcations were included in the
study, and "the deﬁnite diagnosis was regarded as the category with score nearest to the
mean score" (Rogers et al., 1991).
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High Mesothelioma ﬁndings are reported throughout the study, and odds ratios are provided
with their associated 95% conﬁdence intervals.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment High The authors described in their discussion section that they included age as a confounding
variable, as it was a way to frequency match cases and controls.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Low The authors did not provide a description of the methods used for covariate characteriza-
tion.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding N/A As this was a mesothelioma study, there was no need to evaluate potential co-exposures,
as there are few other causes than asbestos exposure, meriting a "not applicable" rating.

Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The study design implemented is appropriate for the research question being examined.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The authors did not provide an explicit discussion of the power for this study, but there
was an adequate number of participants to detect an effect in the exposed population.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium Given the amount of detail provided by the authors, this study is reproducible. Overall,
the authors calculated the relative risk, estimated by odds ratios. Fiber content levels
were used to group participants, and each level was compared with the zero-exposure
group, which was deﬁned as <15,000 ﬁbers by might microscopy, or <200,000 ﬁbers
by TEM. The signiﬁcance of linear trends was determined with the Mantel-Haenszel
chi-squared test. Multiple logistic regression models were also estimated.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium The model used for calculating the risk estimates is transparent. The logistics regression
model operates under the assumption that the distribution of the outcome is binomial.
Domain 6: Other (if applicable) Considerations for Biomarker Selection and Measurement (Lakind et al. 2014)
Metric 16: Use of Biomarker of Exposure High The examination of ﬁber concentrations in lung tissue allow for a quantitative relation-
ship with external exposure. Even though there was the potential for multiple ﬁber types
to be present in the study, the authors were able to identify the speciﬁc ﬁber types by
"comparing the energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDAX) spectrum of the ﬁber with
those of the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) asbestos specimens prepared in
the same manner" (Rogers et al., 1991).
Metric 17: Effect Biomarker N/A The only biomarkers assessed in this study were biomarkers of exposure, as the authors
were examining ﬁber counts in lung tissue.
Metric 18: Method Sensitivity Medium The authors detailed the analytical sensitivity for both light microscopy and TEM. The
sensitivity for light microscopy was 15,000 ﬁbers per gram, and the limit was 200,000
ﬁbers per gram for TEM.
Metric 19: Biomarker Stability Low The authors detail that the lung tissue was preserved in formalin, and they were gen-
erally comprised of a "5x5x5 cm blocks from the lower lobe of the uninvolved lung"
(Rogers et al., 1991). They did not describe the storage history further or information
pertaining to stability.
Metric 20: Sample Contamination Medium There is no information provided about the potential contamination of the samples.
Metric 21: Method Requirements Medium The authors utilized light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy to deter-
mine ﬁber concentrations.
Metric 22: Matrix Adjustment Low There was no description of matrix adjustments performed in this study.

Additional Comments: This study sought to examine the relationship between mesothelioma and asbestos ﬁber type and concentration found in postmortem lung tissue samples.
One of the strengths of this study was that the authors utilized a panel of pathologists to identify, on a scale, a histologic classiﬁcation of mesothelioma.
Another strength was their use of TEM for the quantiﬁcation of asbestos ﬁbers. Some limitations included a lack of information surrounding storage and
contamination for the lung tissue samples, as well as the temporality. However, because this study examined postmortem samples, it can still be assumed
that exposure preceded the outcome.

Domain Metric Rating Comments
Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection High The rating is based on asbestos part 1 evaluation description: "Subjects included men
from the Balangero mine worker cohort that were employed in an Italian asbestos mine.
The initial cohort ((Rubino et al., 1979, HEROID: 178), pg 188) consisted of 952 men
employed between 1/1/1930 and 12/31/1965, with at least 30 calendar days’ employ-
ment during that period." and the description in the paper of interest (Ferrante et al.,
2020, HEROID: 6861719: "The cohort included 974 male workers employed for at least
6 months and active at the Balangero mine on 1st January 1946 or hired subsequently
until the cessation of activity." While these accounts differ, it is likely meant to suggest
that only subjects with mortality, which began 1/1/46, are included in Ferrante et al.,
which extended mortality follow up to 5/31/2013.
Metric 2: Attrition High In Ferrante et al., 2020, HEROID: 6861719, only 21/974 (2% ) workers were lost by
follow up in 2013.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium As per asbestos part 1, this is rated high, however the paper in question Ferrante et al.,
2020, HEROID 6861719 does not explicitly address this metric. As per asbestos part
1: "The most complete data on comparison groups is available from the most recent
follow-up (Pira et al., 2017). General population mortality rates using the whole country
from 1955 until 1980 and speciﬁcally the Piedmont Region (where the mine is located)
from 1981 onwards (no regional rates available prior to 1981). The 1955-1959 rates
were applied to 1946-1954 period (no available data); this may have led to an underesti-
mate of expected deaths which may have showed and increased rate during this period.
Expected numbers of deaths (overall and selected cancers) were computed using age-
speciﬁc and calendar-year-speciﬁc (5-year categories) male death rates (Pira et al., 2017)
pg 559."
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium From asbestos part 1: "Most complete report of exposure assessment is in initial co-
hort study ((Rubino et al., 1979) pg 189). Chrysotile ﬁber counts were ﬁrst measured
in 1969 using membrane ﬁlter collection and phase contrast microscopy (frequency
not reported). To estimate exposure from 1946-1969, factory records on daily produc-
tion, equipment used, characteristics of the job and number of hours/day were used
(this method has considerable limitations due to basis on mean values for large job cat-
egories and no allowance for changes in weather). Simulated and measured data were
made comparable by using weighting factors (e.g., more dusty operation for 1-2 hr/d
compared with longer working hours in the past)."

Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The study design (cohort with follow up and analyses of mesothelioma incidence counts
by Poisson regression) was appropriate (Ferrante et al., 2020, HEROID: 6861719).
However it is unclear why authors did not complete a Cox survival model.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The number of participants (n=953) are adequate to detect an effect in the exposed pop-
ulation (Ferrante et al., 2020, HEROID: 6861719).
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The description of the analysis is sufﬁcient to understand how to conceptually reproduce
the analysis with access to the analytic data (Ferrante et al., 2020, HEROID: 6861719).
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Low Relative risks were calculated for mesothelioma incidence using Poisson regression,
however model assumptions were not explicitly addressed (i.e., does outcome data ﬁt
the Poisson distribution?). Authors state only: "95% CI were estimated assuming the
Poisson distribution of observed cases." However, it is unclear if they mean all outcomes
or a speciﬁc one (potentially only mesothelioma).

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium 66 cases and 66 controls from ﬁve towns across seven clinical centers in West Germany
between January 1, 1988 and December 31, 1991. Cases had deﬁnite diagnosis of dif-
fuse malignant mesothelioma conﬁrmed by a panel of pathologists. Inclusion criteria for
cases included the presence of a lung tissue sample, for which only 66 of the 324 con-
ﬁrmed mesothelioma cases. The 66 controls were selected from a combined pool of 315
hospital patients treated by surgical lung resection for something other than mesothe-
lioma and 182 population controls. Controls were matched to cases using age, sex, and
region of residence. Both cases and controls needed to be of German nationality. It is
unclear how many controls were sourced from the hospital patients and how many were
sourced from the population.
Metric 2: Attrition High There was no reported subject withdrawal from the study of the matched 66 cases with
lung tissue samples and controls and the outcome and exposure data were both largely
complete.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium Cases and controls had to be of German nationality, had to be willing and able to give an
interview, and had to provide written informed consent. Control group mostly had lung
cancer, and for some of these controls lung cancer might be caused by an asbestos expo-
sure, introducing possible bias. Controls were matched to cases according to age ( 5
years), sex, and region of residence. It is unclear how many controls were sourced from
hospital patients and how many were sourced from the population. Also, occupation was
not used in matching criteria.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Lung tissue ﬁber analysis by TEM - single time point of measurement.

sure:<0.05, 0.05- <0.1, 0.1- <0.2, 0.2- <0.5, and >=0.5 f/ mg, and odds ratios compare
odds of mesothelioma in each of the four upper exposure categories to the to the lowest
exposure category.

CharacterizationHigh Out of 450 incident patients with a suspicious diagnosis of diffuse malignant mesothe-
lioma (DMM), 324 had a deﬁnite diagnosis conﬁrmed by a panel of pathologists (66 of
which were cases in this study).
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High Mesothelioma ﬁndings are reported in the abstract, results, and discussion sections.
Odds ratios are reported with 95% conﬁdence intervals, and the number of cases/
controls that fall into each exposure category are reported as well.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium Confounding was addressed by controlling for a continuous variable for age and binary
variables for the clinical center (Hamburg/others) and sex. Race was not adjusted for in
the models, and it is unclear if the study participants were of multiple races as this was
not reported. Also, study authors had information on smoking habits but did not control
for this information in models.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium It is assumed that confounder information was assessed from the standardized question-
naire to collect detailed occupational history that is mentioned in the methods section,
though it is not clear from the study details exactly where confounder information was
sourced.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding N/A Odds ratios related to Chrysotile and all "other mineral ﬁbers" were adjusted for the
concentration of amphibole ﬁbers longer than 5 mm.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium Case-control design was appropriate, and appropriate statistical methods (logistic regres-
sion) were used.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium With only 66 cases and 66 controls split into ﬁve exposure groups, the sample size is rel-
atively small, but there is sufﬁcient sample size to detect an effect. However, conﬁdence
intervals are very wide, suggesting imprecise estimates of effect due to the small number
of cases/controls in each cell.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The description of the analysis is generally sufﬁcient to understand how to conceptually
reproduce the analysis with access to the analytic data, however the authors note that
they perform a logarithmic transformation to asbestos and amphibole ﬁber concentra-
tions, but they did not specify the base that was used.

ratios relating ﬁber concentrations in the lung to mesothelioma diagnoses. The authors
explained that they log transformed the ﬁber concentrations because they were inher-
ently right skewed distributions, and added 0.1 f/ mg to each concentrations to avoid
taking the logarithm of zero. Authors adjusted the odds ratios by age, sex, and region as

nolite/tremolite, and anthophyllite), and also measured for length. Lung ﬁbers them-
selves are derived from multiple parent chemicals, but the lung ﬁbers were able to be
classiﬁed into asbestos-speciﬁc categories when appropriate.
Metric 17: Effect Biomarker N/A Health outcome was measured by diagnosis from a panel of pathologists, rather than a
speciﬁc biomarker of effect.
Metric 18: Method Sensitivity Low Median detection limits were reported as 0.16 ﬁbers/ mg of dried lung tissue for ﬁbers
of all lengths and 0.029 ﬁbers/ mg dry weight for ﬁbers longer than 5 mm. However,
median concentrations of 0.02 ﬁbers/ mg dry weight are reported in Table III, calling into
question the actual limit of detection.
Metric 19: Biomarker Stability High Detailed methodology for lung tissue ﬁber analysis by STEM were described in detail
including low temperature ashing. No known losses during storage were reported.
Metric 20: Sample Contamination Medium There is no information included in the study about contamination.
Metric 21: Method Requirements High Scanning transmission electron microscope (TEM) was performed to examine asbestos
ﬁber species together with other mineral ﬁbers in human lung tissue. TEM is considered
the best method for counting asbestos ﬁbers.
Metric 22: Matrix Adjustment N/A Matrix adjustment is not required for assessment of lung ﬁber concentrations.
Additional Comments: Study could have been improved with higher sample size, as well as additional details about logarithmic adjustment, but the study contains data that could
be potentially useful for dose-response in measuring the relationship between asbestos lung ﬁber concentrations and mesothelioma.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection High In this retrospective cohort study, Seidel et al 1984 (HEROID 257) examined cause-
speciﬁc mortality in a cohort of male workers at an amosite asbestos factory in Paterson,
NJ that operated from June 1941 to November 1954. The cohort was described as al-
most entirely white (mentioned in Seidman et al., 1979 HEROID 94625). This study
excluded deaths in the ﬁrst ﬁve years, analyzing mortality occurring 5-40 years after
employment. Of all 933 men recruited to work from June 1941 to December 1945, this
study excluded 113: 35 who worked with asbestos elsewhere (21 before starting and 14
afterwards); 40 who died within 5 years; and 38 lost to follow-up shortly after leaving
the plant. The remaining 820 participants had worked at the facility for as little as one
month up to several years. The mean age at employment was 41.9 years (50.8% aged
>40 years). Three aspects of participant selection helped to limit bias. First, the study
avoided healthy worker selection bias because all workers were eligible for inclusion
regardless of date of initial employment, and regardless of duration of employment. In
addition, the study used an exposure lag to reduce potential bias by taking disease la-
tency into account: asbestos exposure at this plant may not have been causally related
to disease outcomes with latency periods of 5 years. Finally, participants exposed to
asbestos in other work settings were excluded.
Metric 2: Attrition High Only a few eligible workers (n=38) had been lost to follow-up at the start of this study.
There was little additional attrition of the 820 participants in this follow-up through
1982, which included: 4 additional men lost to follow-up, and 5 who contributed person-
time until starting asbestos work elsewhere (i.e., became ineligible; see p. 3). Of the 811
remaining men, 593 had died and 218 were still alive, accounting for the complete co-
hort. A later publication (Seidman et al., 1986, HEROID 290) reported similar numbers
(5 lost to follow-up, 6 who began asbestos work elsewhere, 216 alive). Table 1 shows,
for each 5-year period of follow-up, the number of workers at risk, the mean age of
those workers, and the number of deaths that occurred, along with the small number lost
to follow-up.
Metric 3: Comparison Group High Standardized mortality ratios were calculated comparing all eligible workers in the co-
hort to white male residents of New Jersey in the same 5-year age groups during the
same calendar periods. The authors reported elsewhere (Seidman et al., 1979 HEROID
94625) that death rates from cancer in New Jersey were "among the highest in the
United States". The choice of the state referent helped to account for the regional back-
ground rates of cancer mortality.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low No ﬁber or dust count measures were available for this facility. Estimates were based
on measures taken in 1967, 1970 and 1971 at two other plants run by the same company
(in Tyler, TX; Port Allegany, PA) making the same products with the same machinery.
Details on sampling equipment and procedures, or references to obtain that informa-
tion, were not provided. Dr. William Nicholson helped to "assign plausible estimates" to
"particular jobs" (i.e., estimates were extrapolated from later measures at other facilities
using professional judgment). There were no details on how data were used, no discus-
sion of comparable ventilation/dust extraction, and no references cited. It is not possible
to ascertain the likely validity of ﬁber count estimates. Fiber-years/cc for each worker
were calculated by multiplying estimated ﬁber counts for each job duty by the duration
of work in that post. The median count of ﬁbers >5mper cc across jobs was 50; counts
for a list of job titles were shown in Table 5 (e.g., 5 for ofﬁce workers, 15 for inspectors
and foremen, 50 for production supervisors, 100 for pulverizers). Potential sources of
error noted by the authors included: (i) the tendency for industrial hygienists to over-
sample dustier areas (counts too high, underestimate dose-response); (ii) the possibility
that short-term workers "may have experienced an apprenticeship period in which they
did some of the dirtier work in their department" (counts too low, over-estimate effect of
short-term exposure); and (iii) lack of information on use of respirators (measurement
error, uncertain if a source of bias). The study reports that there was a "concerted ef-
fort to have the Paterson plant workers use respirator protectors" although no details on
compliance are provided.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Exposure was analyzed using categories of ﬁber-years/cc and work duration. Data were
presented using 8 categories of ﬁber-years/cc ( <6, 6-11.9, 12-24.9, 25-49.9, 50-99.9,
100-149.9, 150-249.9, 250+ ﬁber-years/cc), as well as dichotomized ( <25 vs 25+
ﬁber-years/cc). Exposure duration was classiﬁed in 7 categories ( <1 month, 1 month,
2 months, 3-5 months, 6-11 months, 1 year, 2+ years); boundaries for these periods
were not provided. In addition, some analyses calculated SMRs classiﬁed by depart-
ment of work (e.g., Table 11 in HEROID 257; see also Table XIII in Seidman et al, 1986
HEROID 290). Only incidence is provided for mesothelioma outcomes, with no statisti-
cal analysis.
Metric 6: Temporality High Temporality and duration of follow-up was appropriate for the outcomes evaluated (mul-
tiple cancers, mesothelioma, and asbestosis). Follow-up ranged from a minimum of 5 to
a maximum of 40 years.

Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationMedium ICD codes for mesotheliomas were not provided or discussed. The authors reported the
"best evidence (BE)" available to classify cause of death, in addition to death certiﬁcate
(DC) information. Tables comparing BE and DE indicated that additional information
increased the number of mesotheliomas identiﬁed, as well as knowledge of the site of
mesotheliomas. Best evidence included additional information from autopsy, surgical
specimens, x-ray ﬁlms and clinical ﬁndings (Seidman et al., 1979 HEROID 94625).
Details on BE sources used to characterize mesotheliomas were not discussed, but in-
sights can be inferred from acknowledgements (e.g., see Seidman et al, 1986 HEROID
290), which mention receiving generous help from medical facilities including hospitals,
pathologists, and state health departments, with several facilities and clinicians listed by
name.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High Information is presented for all outcomes described. The authors present details on the
observed and expected numbers of deaths stratiﬁed by categories of exposure or time
period, along with the resulting SMRs; statistical signiﬁcance is indicated. There is no
evidence of selective reporting.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium Because of small numbers and limited data, analyses of mortality from mesothelioma
were based on death rates per million-man years overall, stratiﬁed by follow-up time,
and by indicators of exposure. Counts of mesotheliomas were also shown overall as well
as stratiﬁed by exposure and duration of follow-up.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium Analyses speciﬁc to mesothelioma did not include covariates; no confounding bias was
expected.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low In this occupational setting, potential co-exposures are not discussed. There is no infor-
mation to suggest the presence of other important co-exposures in this setting. The fac-
tory supplied the US. Navy with asbestos insulation for the pipes, boilers, and turbines
of its ships. The manufacturing procedures carried out in the factory were described on
p. 5 of the manuscript (HEROID 257).
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The retrospective cohort design was appropriate and mortality rates were calculated
appropriately.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium Based on best evidence, there were 17 mesotheliomas identiﬁed during the 5-to-40-year
follow-up (9 peritoneal, 8 pleural).
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The descriptions of analyses are brief but adequate. Tables included detailed counts of
deaths, including mesotheliomas.

Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium Death rates per million person-years were calculated for mesothelioma. As the authors
note, person-years were limited due to the high mortality in the cohort.
Additional Comments: This retrospective cohort study evaluated mortality in 820 workers at an amosite factory in New Jersey that operated between 1941 and 1954. Workers
were almost exclusively white males. The authors reduced the likelihood of healthy worker selection bias by including all workers who were not exposed
to asbestos elsewhere regardless of date of initial employment, and regardless of duration of employment. The authors were able to access medical records
that appear to have improved the characterization of outcomes such as mesotheliomas (e.g., see Selikoff et al., 1992 HEROID 709720). With a high mean
age at initial employment ( >40 years) mortality was high even after relatively short follow-up. Employment patterns facilitated the analysis of mortality
in workers with as little as one month of work. The study estimated death rates per million man-years for mesotheliomas overall and for two sites (pleural,
peritoneal) stratiﬁed by exposure in ﬁber-years/cc (observed as low as 6-11.9 ﬁber-years/cc) and by duration of time worked (observed as low as 2 months).
The major weakness of the study is that ﬁber count data were not available for this facility. Estimates were extrapolated based on measures taken at later
dates at other locations operated by the same company, based on professional judgment. Validity of these estimates cannot be ascertained.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low This metric is rated Low because the study or any cited methods source does not explic-
itly mention the use of PCM or TEM.Authors state that there was "no direct observa-
tions of ﬁber counts in this factory". Instead, ﬁber counts from other Paterson factories
were used in this study. There is more information of the earlier version of this study,
which reports that that Paterson factory used the same ﬁbers and followed the same
production process. Samples were made in October 1971 and followed "5u + ﬁbers av-
eraged as high as 23 ﬁbers/ml (Seidman et al., 1979). There is no deﬁning of what tools
were used to measure ﬁbers in either study.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Range of exposure is appropriate, as it ranges in elapsed number of years since onset of
work as 5-9 years, 5-14 years, 5-19 years, 5-24 years, 5-29 years, 5-34 years, and 5-39
years. However, the exposure dose is not based on ﬁber concentration but on exposure
time.
Additional Comments: Please note that this study would not be evaluated under the current guidelines. This is due to the low rating for metric 4, as no PCM or TEM was mentioned
in the study or a cited source.This study is a follow-up to RefID 94625 by the same authors. Comments referencing this study will be cited as (Seidman
et al., 1979).Overall, this study provides an analysis of workers from the Paterson factory to that of the general New Jersey population. There is some
discrepancy when it comes to the race of the cohort and the comparison groups, and age is not provided in the study. Conﬁdence intervals are also not
provided in the study results of SMRs and SIRs, but signiﬁcant is noted when appropriate.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low No measurements were taken at factory A, so no data is available. Factory B had an-
nual dust mass measurements from 1975-1993, and ﬁbers per milliliter were available
for 1996-1998. There was no discussion of the tools used to ascertain these measure-
ments.This metric is rated low because the study or any cited methods source does not
explicitly mention the use of PCM or TEM.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low The authors report the concentrations of asbestos in factory B varied from 1.9-4.0 mg/
m^ 3 for 1975-89, and was 1.2-2.2 mg/m^ 3 from 1990-1993. In 1996-1998, ﬁber mea-
surement shows the concentration 0.5-1.0 f/ml. These values are only available for fac-
tory B as no measurements were taken at facility A.
Additional Comments: With regards to mesothelioma outcomes, there is not a lot of information provided. Only one female participant had a case of mesothelioma, and the
authors included expected numbers of mesothelioma cases in men. The lack of data on asbestos concentrations in one of the factories examined may also
limit the results discussed in the paper.NOTE: Metric 4 was rated as low because there was no mention of PCM or TEM in the study or any cited source.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Subjects were vermiculite miners, millers, and processors from a mine operating in
Libby, Montana. The authors specify that some subjects may have been "assigned jobs
in the screening plant, railroad loading dock, expansion plants, or an ofﬁce located in the
town of Libby (several miles from the mine)." The cohort was designed to include all
white males hired at Libby from September 1935 to December 1981, and the total co-
hort was identiﬁed in May 1982 and subjects were followed through December 2001. It
is not clear exactly how subjects were recruited or identiﬁed, though it is likely that the
authors used data from an existing NIOSH database. Demographic data was collected
from a NIOSH database and then validated against microﬁlm company records. One
person originally identiﬁed (presumably from the NIOSH database) was removed due
to company records stating that the employee never actually worked. After excluding 9
participants for missing demographic data, there were 1,871 study subjects. However,
after additional exclusions based on missing outcome data and to limit the analysis sam-
ple to only white men, the ﬁnal analytic sample consisted of 1,672 workers (Sullivan et
al. 2007 HERO ID: 709497).Moolgavkar et al. 2010 (HERO ID: 709457) used the same
cohort as Sullivan et al. 2007 (HERO ID: 709497) but they also excluded 10 individuals
were missing vital status and thus resulted in a ﬁnal analytic sample of 1,662.
Metric 2: Attrition High In Sullivan et al. 2007 (HERO ID: 709497), after 1,871 subjects were identiﬁed for
inclusion, 104 were excluded due to not being white males, and 95 were exclude due
to dying or being lost to follow-up before 1960. Prior to 1960 comparison rates for
asbestosis in NIOSH Life Table Analysis system were not available, requiring exclusion
from the analysis sample. In Moolgavkar et al. 2010 (HERO ID: 709457) an additional
10 participants were excluded due to missing vital status, although it is not clear how
these cases were handled in the original study. There is overall a low rate of attrition and
it is unlikely to be inﬂuenced by both exposure and outcome.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium In Sullivan et al. 2007 (HERO ID: 709497) and SMRs were calculated as the primary
statistical analysis. Reference mortality rates were pulled from the NIOSH Life Table
Analysis system. It is not speciﬁed whether this reference population was the general
US population or an occupational-only population. Since the analysis samples only
contained white males, there was no need to adjust by race or sex. However, SMRs were
adjusted for age at risk and calendar-year of follow-up in Sullivan et al. 2007 (HERO
ID: 709497). Moolgavkar et al. 2010 (HERO ID: 709457) also performed a regression
analysis for mesothelioma that did not report any adjustments.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium In this cohort, all studies used the exact same method of assessing exposure through
quantiﬁcation using PCM and assignment to participants via a job-exposure matrix,
based on one used in an earlier NIOSH study (Amandus and Wheeler, 1987 HERO ID:
29839). In Sullivan et al. 2007 (HERO ID: 709497) and Moolgavkar et al. 2010 (HERO
ID: 709457) adjustments to the JEM were made, most notably to assign workers with
the "common laborer" job assignments or unknown job assignments the average esti-
mated exposure intensity for all unskilled jobs, as opposed to using the relatively low
exposure estimate for the mill yard in Libby. Thus, estimates of cumulative exposure
were higher in this cohort study than other studies using the same JEM. Additionally,
obtaining work histories for these studies resulted in additional jobs that were not de-
tailed in the original NIOSH JEM. Exposure estimates for these jobs and corresponding
calendar periods were extrapolated based on review of exposure records from other stud-
ies of Libby workers and professional judgment. Work history to assign exposure was
gathered from a NIOSH database created in the 1980"s and was validated against mi-
croﬁlm company records. The authors do not specify how many samples were analyzed
for use in the JEM. In statistical analysis results were presented in terms of cumulative
exposure (ﬁber/cc-years).
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium All studies in the cohort have an adequate distribution of exposure to detect an effect.
All studies report at least three levels of exposure or use a continuous model of exposure
in their SMR analyses.
Metric 6: Temporality High In all studies there was a minimum of 20 years of follow-up since a participant"s ﬁrst
exposure, and the workers hired earliest had >65 years of prior exposure data since the
study was designed to capture those employed between 1935 and 1981.

Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationMedium Vital status was determined through 2001 by the National Death Index resources, the
Social Security Administration resources, the internet (Ancestry.com; RootsWeb.com,
and electronic links to state death records). And a tracking service. Workers found to
be alive on or after 1/1/1979, when the National Death Index tracking began, but not
found in the Index, were assumed to be alive as of 12/31/2001. Vital status follow-up
was successful for 97.8% of the cohort. While some of the resources have a high degree
of certainty, others such as the internet-based resources are of questionable quality.
There is no explanation of what percentage each resource was used to ascertain vital
status, but the more reliable method such as National Death Index are likely to be more
informative and thus used more often. Thus, while there is some uncertainty that the
vital status ascertainment was fully accurate, it is unlikely that a signiﬁcant number of
participants would have their vital status changed or that this would be related to their
exposure status. .For 97% of the participants known to be deceased, exact cause of death
was pulled from death certiﬁcates and coded using the ICD codes relevant at the time
of death, ranging from ICD-8 to ICD-10. Deaths prior to 1979 were coded by a single
National Center for Health Statistics-trained nosologist; after 1979 ICD codes were
obtained from the National Death Index. Final results present ICD-9 codes, so it can be
assumed that all codes were converted to that system, although their methodology is not
explained.The ICD-10 code presented for mesothelioma was reported as C45.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High All stated outcomes are reported in the results.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium In Sullivan et al. 2007 (HERO ID: 709497) SMRs were calculated and the sample only
included white males, so there was no need to adjust for race and gender. Sullivan et
al. 2007 (HERO ID: 709497) state that they also adjusted for age at risk and calendar
year of follow-up. Moolgavkar et al. 2010 (HERO ID: 709457) also performed a Cox
proportional hazards model analysis in which they adjusted for year of birth. They state
that they used year of birth as a "rough surrogate" for smoking habits as well, which is
not a sufﬁcient consideration for smoking.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium All covariate information was obtained from the NIOSH database and cross-checked
against microﬁlmed company records.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low In this occupational setting, no co-exposures are adjusted for. Sullivan et al. 2007
(HERO ID: 709497) notes that there was insufﬁcient data to estimate exposure to other
contaminants such as diesel particulate generated by mine machinery, or exposure to
silica.

Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The use of SMRs and regression analyses to understand the long-term impact of as-
bestos exposure on mortality is appropriate. The use of a cohort design is also appropri-
ate to assess outcomes with a long latency such as lung cancer.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The number of participants used in the analysis sample varies by study but is always
sufﬁciently large to detect an effect. Sullivan et al. 2007 (HERO ID: 709497) had a
ﬁnal analysis sample of 1,672; Moolgavkar et al. 2010 (HERO ID: 709457) had a ﬁnal
analysis sample of 1,662. There is not a signiﬁcant discussion of power, but Sullivan
et al. 2007 (HERO ID: 709497) states that the study has low power for lung cancer
outcomes at lower exposure levels. There are some potential concerns for low power
since the overall incidence of mesothelioma was low (n=2).
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium While several details are not explained in detail, such as how the ICD-8 through ICD-10
codes were converted to ICD-9 codes, overall the descriptions of methods across the
cohort are detailed enough that it would be possible to reproduce the results given access
to the analytic data.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium While there is no formal discussion of assumptions in statistical models in both Sullivan
et al. 2007 (HERO ID: 709497) and Bateson et al. 2014 (HERO ID: 2238712, there
are no assumptions in SMR or Cox proportional hazards model that would reasonably
expect to be unmet. Moolgavkar et al. 2010 (HERO ID: 709457) contains those same
analyses without a formal discussion of assumptions, but also analyses mesothelioma
using a maximum likelihood equation in which they assume a Poisson distribution.
Additional Comments: In these cohort studies of Libby, Montana employees exposure was measured via PCM and assigned using a JEM. Participants were followed up for a
minimum of 20 years from ﬁrst exposure, and mortality outcomes were examined in relation to asbestos exposure through SMR and regression analysis.
While there is some potential for outcome and exposure misclassiﬁcation, the impact of potential misclassiﬁcation is unlikely to signiﬁcantly bias the
results of the cohort. Signiﬁcant effects were found mesothelioma mortality across the cohort.The measurement exposure (M4) and/or exposure levels
(M5) metrics are rated as medium upon review by both set of reviewers. Also, the overall quality determination (OQD) is rated medium. Extraction has
been completed and quality control reviewed.

Additional Comments: This study assessed the risk of asbestos-related malignancies (including mesothelioma) among persons with diagnosed asbestosis. In terms of exposure,
the authors used weighted asbestos concentrations to assessing exposures. They did not provide any information about measurement tools such as midget
impingers, TEM, or PCM. On the other hand, they used ICD-9 codes to ascertain health and mortality outcomes.While information on the measurement of
exposure metric (M4) to assess exposure was limited or rated low. The exposure levels metric (M5) information reported was adequate or rated medium to
determine exposure-response relationships. The overall rating for this outcome/study is medium.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Exposure was assessed during one time period during diagnostic thoracotomy or au-
topsy. Though the authors stated that asbestos ﬁbers in lung tissues were counted both
by TEM and SEM in the method section, the result section reported exposure data mea-
sured by SEM only.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The study provided a range of exposure groups (overall 2 exposure groups: <1 x 10^ 6

reported: >10 x 10^ 6, 100 x 10^ 6, and 1000 x 10^ 6 ﬁbers/g dry tissue).
Additional Comments: QC was not completed for metrics other than Metrics 4 and 5 because the study does not have sufﬁcient exposure information to be useful for dose-response
analysis. The authors mentioned using TEM to develop quantitative estimates of exposure but only reported SEM results, resulting in a low conﬁdence

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Asbestos ﬁber concentration in lung tissue samples collected at forensic autopsy was
measured via Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and type of ﬁber was examined via
energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Both ﬁber level and asbestos body (AB) load
was measured on a 2mm^ 2 ﬁlter area at 2000M. In analyses, the following groupings
were made to assess type of ﬁber: chrysotile/asbestiform antigorite, tremolite/actinolite
asbestos. Exposure was measured in autopsied lungs, thus the measurements represent
a single time period but likely qualify cumulative asbestos exposures.Unfortunately,
the exposure was assessed using a quantitative method other than PCM or TEM and
conversion factors were not determined.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low The range and distribution of exposure are not adequate to develop an exposure-
response estimate.
Additional Comments: This case-control study had largely adequate approaches to assessing the relationship between asbestos exposure and mesothelioma. A primary weakness
of the study is the approach to statistical analyses, as the Mann-Whitney test fails to allow for the inclusion of covariates. The methods for measuring
exposure and identifying mesothelioma mortality were appropriate.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium This prospective occupational study examined the health effects of asbestos exposure
among a group of workers from an asbestos textile factory in China. Male workers were
included in the study if they were registered workers in the factory on January 1972
and did not have signs of malignant tumors. Follow up continued through 2008. 586
workers were recruited for the original cohort, and 577 workers remained through the
follow up period (98.5% participation rate at ﬁnal follow up). While the study boasts a
high participation rate, it is unclear what percentage of the total eligible workers were
initially recruited in 1972, preventing a high rating in this domain.
Metric 2: Attrition High This study had a participation rate of 98.5% at the ﬁnal follow up, a high rate that mini-
mizes concerns about bias introduced via subject attrition. Analyses were limited to the
577 subjects that had complete follow up information. Outcome and exposure data are
complete for study subjects.
Metric 3: Comparison Group High Authors provide a description of comparisons between the three exposure groups and
noted differences in age, exposure duration, and smoking in the three groups. These
variables were included as cofounders in Cox proportional hazard models, thus effec-
tively controlling for the differences between the groups.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Asbestos levels in the factory were quantitatively measured via TEM in 1982 and 2006,
with an assertion that levels remained over 2 mg/m^ 3 during the study period. Personal
sampling was conducted to assess the levels in different areas of the factory, which
was ultimately used to construct three exposure groups (high, medium, low). Authors
note that 70% of the workers had stable positions in the factory for the duration of the
study. These positions were used to place workers into exposure categories. While these
exposure estimates were based on quantitative measures and the role in the factory,
there is still potential for nondifferential misclassiﬁcation of exposure due to the limited
quantitative measuring and the lack of speciﬁcity about those who did have varying roles
during their employment.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Exposure categories were high, medium, and low, based on the job description of work-
ers and sampling results from the factory.
Metric 6: Temporality High This study has over 30 years of follow-up, and subjects did not have signs of malignan-
cies during recruitment. This is an appropriate timeframe to assess mesothelioma with a
latency period of 20 years.

Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationUninformative Authors note that two deaths from mesothelioma were identiﬁed among the study co-
hort. One case was pleural and one peritoneal. Deaths were identiﬁed through employ-
ment records and through municipal registries. There is no indication that ICD codes
were used to identify the cases, nor that death records captured non-site speciﬁc cases of
mesothelioma.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium Authors report two mesothelioma cases in the results and discussion, but do not report
quantitative results (effect estimates with conﬁdence intervals, etc.) that would be useful
for extraction).
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment High The authors appropriately adjust for variables that vary among the three exposure
groups. Age, duration of exposure, and smoking were included as covariates in Cox
proportional hazard models.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium Data on covariates was collected from factory records. Additionally, smoking informa-
tion was collected from individuals via interview or from family members via interview.
There was no indication of validation of factory records, though the records can be as-
sumed to be fairly accurate, thus meriting a medium rating.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding N/A Per mesothelioma-speciﬁc guidance, concern about co-exposures is limited or likely not
relevant for mesothelioma, meriting a "not applicable" rating.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium This study used a prospective cohort design to assess mesothelioma, which has a long
latency period. This is an appropriate design for this health outcome. Additionally a Cox
proportional hazard model was used to compare the medium and high exposure groups
to the low exposure group (referent).
Metric 13: Statistical Power N/A Per instructions, this metric was not rated for mesothelioma.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses N/A Per instructions, this metric was not rated for mesothelioma. Additionally, an analysis
was not conducted for mesothelioma cases.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis N/A Per instructions, this metric was not rated for mesothelioma. Additionally, a statistical
model was not built for mesothelioma cases.
Additional Comments: This study is uninformative for mesothelioma outcomes, as the authors did not conduct statistical analyses for the two mesothelioma cases. Additionally,
the mesothelioma outcome was not assessed using ICD codes. The examination of mesothelioma through employee records seems to only assess pleural
and peritoneal cases, meriting and uninformative rating.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Exposure was calculated either through an algorithm or manual exposure assessment
based on self-reported data from the interviews. Methods used included job exposure
matrices (JEM) and supplementary questions (SQ). While this may be grounds for get-
ting categorized as uninformative due to the risk of exposure misclassiﬁcation, this was
a study that compared methods and their efﬁciency in characterizing asbestos exposure.
Authors discuss the merit of including indirect exposure questions to reduce differential
recall. However, MESO-JEM was designed to detect low-level exposure in relation with
mesothelioma and LHC-JEM was designed for a larynx-hypopharynx study.This study
did not use midget impinger, PCM or TEM for measurements.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low Different levels of exposure are reported throughout the analyses in the study. However,
exposure was dichotomized for dual assessments (1) between the JEMS and (2) by

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Low Among 474 active workers currently employed in any 6 cement factories spread
throughout Turkey, the study enrolled 424 (89% ). "The number of workers were 36,
42, 44, 62, 81 and 159, respectively" per asbestos factory. Authors do not describe re-
cruitment methods, the share of workers per factory recruited, or any additional inclu-
sion criteria. There is no discussion on whether exposure-outcome distribution may have
varied by those included vs. those excluded.
Metric 2: Attrition Low Of the initial 424 workers enrolled, authors reported that 406 responded to survey ques-
tions on birthplace, and among those, 334 (82.3% ) had chest x-rays of acceptable qual-
ity. Authors note that workers who had unusable chest x-rays were older and had longer
duration of work, resulting in bias of the sample, with younger subjects with lower du-
rations of exposure and presumably better respiratory health. There is no discussion of
this potential bias beyond stating the reason why subjects did not have usable x-rays. In
addition, only 260 workers have both workplace asbestos exposure and lung function
test results, allowing them to be included in models.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium Authors describe comparison groups as workers "who were titled with the jobs not re-
lated to asbestos dust". Age, duration of work, and radiological ﬁndings were used for
each outcome. Authors illustrate few differences (only in opacities and lung function
outcomes) among groups. There is limited detail on the comparison group with jobs not
related to asbestos exposure.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Authors report following the methods of the Asbestos International Association guid-
ance of 1982. Samples were "collected on 25 mm diameter cellulose ester membrane
ﬁlters with 1.2 mm pores in open face cowled casettes made of conductive plastic. Fil-
ters were mounted on glass slides and cleared with acetone vapor. One hundred ﬁelds
of a Walton Beckett granule were counted at 400 times magniﬁcation with phase con-
trast microscope." It is unclear how often these samples were taken (one time measure or
multiple times), when, or what duration. Asbestos ﬁbers were reported in ﬁbre/mL.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Asbestos exposures are presented dichotomously (No/Possible), as well as continuously
(natural log transformed). The median and range of concentrations is 0.22 ﬁber/mL
and 0.02-0.76 ﬁber/mL. This distribution is likely sufﬁcient to develop a dose-response
estimate.

Holland) was used to measure the forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory vol-
ume in 1 s (FEV1). At least three forced expiratory maneuvers were completed with the
highest two FEV1 and FVC values within 5% of each other. The highest value of three
maneuvers was recorded and used in the analysis." Authors report using the spirome-
try results for "Predicted values of FEV1 and FVC based on gender, height, and age,
as adopted by Knudson et al. [1983], were used to calculate the predicted FEV1 and
FVC."; Other Non-Cancer Outcomes: Authors report obtaining standard posteroanterior
chest x-rays which were evaluated by two chest physicians individually. The physicians
were blinded and followed revised version of 1980 International Labour Organization
(ILO) Classiﬁcations. A third physician was brought in the case of inconsistency be-
tween two initial readers.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High The methods and results are reported throughout the paper, where regression coefﬁcients
and standard errors or odds ratios and related conﬁdence intervals and p-values are pro-
vided for analyses. The number of workers used in each analysis are reported in the
footnotes of tables.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment High Lung function linear regression analyses were adjusted for age, sex, height, smoking
pack-years, and duration of work. Parenchymal opacities logistic regression analyses
were adjusted for age, ever smoking, ﬁnishing secondary school, and duration of work.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium The questionnaire used for this study was conducted by an interviewer who collected
informed consent from all workers. "The questionnaire included information on demo-
graphics, occupational history, respiratory symptoms, and smoking habits." There was
no validation of smoking answers.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low Authors do not discuss occupational co-exposures and if they may vary by factory. They
do discuss environmental or community exposures to naturally occuring asbestos in
soil (erionite) as based on birthplace. The questionnaire included a question about this
exposure, and only one worker noted that they were born in an area with high erionite
exposure. Authors note that this did not impact their ﬁndings.

Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium Study design and methods are appropriate. The association of lung function and ranges
of exposure to asbestos were "adjusted for potential confounders by stepwise multiple
linear regression analysis with inclusion and exclusion criteria of 0.10 and 0.15, re-
spectively." Multiple logistic regression was used to adjust with radiological ﬁndings of
asbestosis. Analyses report p-value cutoffs of <0.05, 0.01, and 0.0001.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium Population size is adequate to analyze the outcomes for respiratory function and
parenchymal opacities (n=406 for full sample and n=260 for subsample analysis among
workers with workplace asbestos exposure during survey and lung function test).
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The methods and analysis sections are clear enough to understand and conceptually
reproduce the analyses.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Low The models for lung function and small irregular parenchymal opacities in asbestos
workers are transparent. No assumptions are explicitly discussed, however authors do
note they log-transformed asbestos exposure concentration to obtain a normal distribu-
tion.
Additional Comments: Overall, this study is well designed to analyze respiratory function in occupational workers. PCM was used to count asbestos ﬁbres, thus rating Metric 4 as
a medium. Major concerns for bias lie in lack of details on recruitment and higher attrition among older, likely higher-exposed workers. There is no detail
about sampling duration, timing, or frequency.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Some key elements of the study design were not present but available information indi-
cates a low risk of selection bias. Cases (n=89) were deceased individuals who worked
for more than three months between 1907 and 1977 (employed before the beginning of
1976) at an asbestos cement plant located in a small community in the south of Sweden
(Johansson et al., 1987 HeroID:3083094). The cohort that the cases came from appeared
to include both males and females (Johansson et al., 1987 HeroID:3083094) but the
distribution for this demographic characteristic is not provided in the study. Among
these, 69 has lung tissue that were further analyzed. Characteristics such as mean age,
year of ﬁrst employment, employment duration, and time between end of exposure and
death are provided in Table 1. Exclusion criteria are not speciﬁed. Authors mentioned
non-random sampling of the tissue specimens is possible as asbestotic lesions tend to
be in a speciﬁc area of the lungs and have higher counts of ﬁbres than other parts of the
lungs. Tissues from these parts of the lungs may have been observed in some of the ex-
posed workers, which could explain difference between the exposed workers and their
controls, although they say this is "highly unlikely."
Metric 2: Attrition High This study reports retrospective data of deceased individuals, thus subject withdrawal
from the study is not of concern. None of the cases were excluded for analyses. Out-
come and exposure data appear to be complete.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium There is indirect evidence that cases and controls are similar. Cases were matched with
controls by sex, age, and year and place of death. Necropsy ﬁles came from the Uni-
versity Hospital of Lund, which is one of the three departments where necropsy ﬁles
for the cases came from (Johansson et al., 1987 HeroID:3083094). The main occupa-
tion is not known or "was speciﬁed as labourer" for 46 controls (Johansson et al., 1987
HeroID:3083094), so healthy worker effect may not be of substantial concern if these 46
controls were in fact employed.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Lung tissues were analyzed by TEM. Energy dispersive x ray spectrometry was used to
determine the type of asbestos ﬁber. These appear to be assessed during one time period
but meant to be reasonably representative of the entire study period.

Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Until 1952, the highest reported concentration was 10 ﬁbres/ml. "During the 1970s
the highest exposure concentration was 4 f/ml." Average concentrations above 2 f/ml
applied to millers, mixers, and workers engaged in polishing and sawing operations.
Mean cumulative exposure is provided with a range of 0-230 f-y/ml and "the logarithm
of the ﬁbre concentrations was used as the dependent variable in the multiple linear
regression." Additionally, Figure 3 illustrates the cumulative distribution of amphibole
content among workers without mesothelioma, while Figure 4 illustrates cumulative
distribution of chrysotile and tremolite content among workers and controls.
Metric 6: Temporality Medium Based on the case data, a >15-year latency appears to be established if we can assume
that this study was conducted after 1984, which is 15 years after 1969 (the latest year
reported for year of ﬁrst employment; see Table 1). However, it is unclear if ﬁbrosis
preceded exposure which the authors admit to by saying "it cannot be judged whether
the ﬁbres accumulated ﬁrst, causing ﬁbrosis, or if the ﬁbrosis occurred ﬁrst, causing a
deterioration of the alveolar clearance of ﬁbre particles."
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationMedium Other Non-Cancer Outcomes: Authors examined lung tissue specimens and stated that
interstitial ﬁbrosis was scored 0-4 according to the classiﬁcation proposed by Hinson et
al." (Hinson et al., 1974 HeroID:3099579). Some analyses dichotomized the presence of
ﬁbrosis.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium Most results seem to be reported in all aspects of the report, including p-values and
sample sizes. There is one instance where exact ﬁber concentrations are discussed in the
abstract text but not in the study. Some results are provided in text but not presented in
tables or ﬁgures.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium Final regression analyses adjusted for age and smoking. Although males and females
were included in the cohort, there is no discussion of adjusting for sex.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium As an occupational study, it can be assumed that covariate data were collected from
personnel records. Information such as mean age, year of ﬁrst employment, employment
duration, and time between end of exposure and death are provided in Table 1.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low Co-exposures were not appropriated adjusted for in analyses. Authors stated that ex-
posed workers higher levels of the following non-asbestos ﬁbres than controls: mullite,
iron, rutile, muscovite, aluminum, and silicon.

Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The study design was appropriate to address the research question. "The Mann-Whitney
U test was used to compare concentrations of ﬁbre or mass estimates between the groups
and Kendall’s test was used to evaluate rank correlates between ﬁbre concentration
or mass estimate and several variables (employment time, ﬁbrosis grade, amount of
smoking, and counts of asbestos bodies)." As a case-control study, logistic regression
and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The case-control study had small sample sizes (cases = 76; controls = 96); however,
authors were able to still detect effects. Despite lower measurements of exposure, effect
estimates among controls were more pronounced than cases, to the authors’ surprise.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low The exposure source was vermiculite ore originally from a mine near Libby, Montana
known to be contaminated with amphibole asbestos and sent for processing to plants
across the U.S., including the WM/WRG facility in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Potential
community member airborne asbestos ﬁber exposure was estimated through a combina-
tion of Minnesota Pollution Control Agency dispersion modeling estimates of air con-
centrations in the community resulting from plant operations and questionnaire-derived
activity-based modeling to establish exposure proﬁles for the enumerated cohort. Expo-
sures were estimated for the period of plant operations 1938-1989. To obtain a sample
representative of the range of community exposures, the popula"tion was stratiﬁed into
groups to represent three exposure scenarios: a) intense intermit"tent exposure, b) long-
term high ambient background exposure, and c) low ambient background exposure. We
classiﬁed people with a childhood history of playing in the piles of waste rock outside
the plant as the group with intense intermittent exposures to potentially high concen-
trations of asbes"tos ﬁbers. The long-term high and low back"ground exposure groups
were selected based on residential history and frequency matched to the age distribu-
tion of the intense intermit"tent exposure category Details of exposure assessments were
described as reported in full within Adgate et al., 2011 (HERO ID 105280). Adgate et
al., 2011 noted that potential activity-based exposure pathways were ascertained based
on previous Libby asbestos studies and questionnaire responses from the MDH/ATSDR
cohort members with direct contact with waste rock, waste piles or vermiculite insu-
lation. Background exposure for those with no reported activity-based exposure was
determined by length of residence in the affected community and estimates of airborne
ﬁber concentration. Adgate et al., 2011 noted that asbestos concentration data was re-
ported within previous publications, including Kelly et al., 2006 (HERO ID 709511).
Kelly et al., 2006 noted that exposure to Libby asbestos at the WRG plant was obtained
from 1970"s industrial hygiene data in air samples analyzed by phase-contrast light
microscopy. Regression models within the current study utilized categories of activity
exposure (f/cc x months), pile-playing exposure (f/cc x months), background exposure
(f/cc x months) and total exposure (f/cc x months). Authors noted that activity-based
exposure was derived from self-reported activities as assessed in 2001 when the cohort
was enumerated, with assumptions of activity duration likely introducing some exposure
misclassiﬁcation. Furthermore, air dispersion models assumed an equivalent exposure
opportunity for all people, regardless of where they spent their day.

response estimates. Regression model results within the current study were reported
across three exposure f/cc x month categories based upon cut points at the 50th and 75th
percentile of the exposure distribution for each exposure category. Estimated exposure
levels in f/cc x months for regression categories of background exposure ( <0.034, 0.034
to<0.077, and >=0.077 f/cc x months), exposure from pile playing ( <0.158, 0.158 to
<0.549, and >=0.549 f/cc x months), total exposure ( <0.0523, 0.0523 to 0.245, and
>= 0.245 f/cc x months), and total activity exposure ( <0.082, 0.082 to <0.422, and
>=0.422 f/cc x months) were detailed.
Additional Comments: This study investigated the association between radiographic pleural abnormalities, parenchymal opacities and other evidence of asbestosis in 461 individu-
als with radiographic assessments and a history before 1980 of nonoccupational direct contact with, or ever playing with, Libby vermiculite ore processing
waste at the Western Minerals/W.R. Grace (WM/WRG) facility in Minneapolis, Minnesota who had never worked at the processing plant or never lived
with a plant worker. Residents were described as often hauling the freely offered rock from the waste piles and using it for gardening and as ﬁll material
for driveways and yards. Neighborhood children also played on the piles of vermiculite processing waste, as access to the site was not restricted. As part of
the Northeast Minneapolis Community Vermiculite Investigation (NMCVI), the Michigan Department of Health (MDH) and ATSDR surveyed over 1,600
properties and worked with the EPA to document contamination on more than 260 properties subsequently cleaned by EPA under the federal Superfund
program as part of an initial community exposure characterization. A history of direct contact with the waste and ever playing in the waste piles was
associated with pleural abnormalities, with a reported odds ratio of [OR] 2.78 [95% conﬁdence inter"val (CI): 1.26, 6.10] and 2.17 (95% CI: 0.99, 4.78),
respectively, when adjusted for background exposure.NOTE: QC was not completed for metrics other than Metrics 4 and 5 because the study does not have

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Neither PCM nor TEM were used for measuring exposure. Exposure data were esti-
mated from the 1966 survey of crocidolite ﬁbers conducted by the Mines Department
of Western Australia. Measurements for former residents were based on periodic sur-
veys of ﬁber counts conducted by the Health Department of Western Australia made in
Wittenoom as well as personal monitors (Alfonso et al., 2004 733567). There is concern
that these measurements were not as precise as those done for former workers (Alfonso
et al., 2005 2079051).
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The distribution of exposure appears to be sufﬁcient to develop an exposure-response
estimate. Cumulative exposure was utilized in statistical models (f/ml-y) (Alfonso et al.,
2004 733567, Alfonso et al., 2005 2079051, Franklin & Robinson 2015 3077939).
Additional Comments: Authors admitted that the selected participants for ﬁnal analyses may not be representative of the whole cohort. This might warrant further review by QC
to determine whether this is grounds for rating Metric 1 as uninformative. As QC reviewer, I agree with this concern from the initial reviewer that there
is potentially some issues with participants selection bias in this study, but overall, I think it has multiple strengths that adds to the body of literature.The
measurement exposure (M4) and/or is rated low upon review by both set of reviewers. However, exposure levels (M5) metrics is rated as medium. Also,
the overall quality determination (OQD) is rated medium.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Low This study incorporated various sections, including both a morbidity and a mortality
study. For the morbidity study, the sample incorporated 191 men employed between
1975 and 1982 and had worked there for at least ﬁve years. This group was incorporated
because over 50% of workers did not have radiographs available, due to either working
less than ﬁve years or being terminated before 1975. The number of study participants
for the mortality analysis was larger, being comprised of 589 white male and female
employees. All of these individuals were hired before 1970 and had been employed for
at least one year. December 31, 1981 was the end of the follow-up period when vital
status was determined. 581 of these workers had their vital status determined, and 417
were alive. This means that there were 164 deceased workers, and death certiﬁcates
were obtained for 162 of them. The Social Security Administration records were used
to determine date of death for the two workers without death certiﬁcates available. More
details about the total number of potential employees within the vermiculite mine/mill,
participation rates, and speciﬁc inclusion/exclusion criteria would be beneﬁcial for this
study.
Metric 2: Attrition High The attrition level in the mortality study was low, with many of the death certiﬁcates
available for 98.8% of the decedents. The attrition level was somewhat higher in the
morbidity study, with only 184 and 121 of the 191 men having radiographs and ques-
tionnaire results available, respectively. This rating would be medium for this portion of
the overall paper.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium To calculate the SMR, expected deaths were determined from the U.S. white male death
rates. For the morbidity study, the author utilized an external control group for smoking,
which was comprised of three groups without asbestos exposure. These groups included
blue-collar workers without pneumoconiosis, non-asbestos cement plant workers, and
coal miners with less than ﬁve years of employment. Control group members were
excluded for various reasons, including if they had worked in a dusty trade, had a radio-
graph with rounded opacities greater than 0/1, or never smoked regularly. There author
did not provide much of a discussion pertaining to similarities between the exposed and
control groups in this study, which would have been beneﬁcial to ensure that analyses
were conducted appropriately.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure High For the morbidity study, the date of the most recent radiograph examination was used
to calculate the cumulative exposure levels. As detailed in the section for the mortal-
ity study, air dust samples were collected at various timepoints in different areas of the
mill/mine. Midget impingers were used to sample the dust in years prior to 1969, and
these values were reported as million particles per cubic foot of air (mppcf). After 1967,
membrane ﬁlter samples were collected, and values were instead reported as ﬁbers per
cubic centimeter of air (f/cc). This information was used to generate a ﬁber-year esti-
mate for the individuals enrolled in the study. It is important to note that only samples
taken between 1965 and 1971 were used for these calculations. Several steps were un-
dertaken to determine job exposure estimates for the ﬁber-years accumulated for the
participants. These steps included coding the workers’ jobs and abstracting ﬁber concen-
trations, dividing the facility into various location-operations, determining the arithmetic
mean to compute average f/cc concentrations, converting impingers measurements into
appropriate units, estimating the exposure level at the various location-operations, utiliz-
ing a plant manager to estimate the hours worked at these locations, determining work
histories, and computing the individual participant"s cumulative exposure index. The
authors also detail that some of the area samples of airborne dust were analyzed with
phase contrast microscopy (Amandus, 1986, 3100838).
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The authors reported a wide range of exposure levels in both the morbidity and the mor-
tality studies. Examples of this include the results of man-year analyses in the mortality
study were broken down into exposure groupings of <50, 50-99, 100-399, and >399 f-
y, and the radiographic ﬁndings by ﬁber-years in the morbidity study, where results were
reported in 0-15, 16-30, 31-85, and >86 ﬁber-year groupings.
Metric 6: Temporality Medium There was a range of latency groups included in the morbidity and mortality studies.
While temporality is established for the participants, it is unclear if there was an ade-
quate level of follow-up for the consideration of latency. For the mortality study, the
average tenure was 8.3 years, while the average tenure for the morbidity study was 14
years. Because the inclusion criteria required workers to have been employed for at least
one year, there is a wide range of potential latencies included in this study.

Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationHigh Lung Cancer: It is reported in the mortality study section that "death certiﬁcates
were obtained from the company and state vital statistics agencies" (Amandus, 1986,
3100838). Each of the underlying causes of death were recoded based on the Interna-
tional Classiﬁcation of Diseases, Eighth Revision. Proper ICD codes were reported for
the lung cancer causes of death, and are mentioned in Table 3.1.; Other Cancer(s): The
underlying causes of death were reclassiﬁed and coded according to the International
Classiﬁcation of Diseases, Eighth Revision. ICD codes respective to the various out-
comes are reported in Table 3.1. Death certiﬁcates were available for 98.8% of those
who were deceased.; Pleural Plaques: As noted in the morbidity study section, the avail-
able radiographs for 184 of the 191 men were examined by three "B" readers using
the ILO classiﬁcation of 1980. The ﬁlms were "taken in 1981-1982 for 134 workers,
in 1976-1980 for 49 workers, and prior to 1975 for only 1 worker" (Amandus, 1986,
3100838). The readers evaluated a number of outcomes, which are detailed on page 56.
It is important to note that the "profusion of small opacities was derived from a median
of the 3 readers, and for each pleural ﬁnding from a consensus of the readers" (Aman-
dus, 1986, 3100838).; Other Non-Cancer Outcomes: Information on causes of mortality
in the mortality study were determined from death certiﬁcates and vital statistic agen-
cies. The causes of death were coded "for statistical analysis according to the Eighth
Revision of the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, adapted" (Amandus, 1986,
3100838). NMRD included such things as pneumonia, emphysema, and tuberculosis.
These outcomes were reported with ICDA codes in Table 3.1.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium There are a number of ﬁndings reported at various points throughout this study. Con-
ﬁdence intervals are reported in some tables for the mortality study, but not for all of
them. This is similar to results presented in the morbidity study, as some tables, such as
4.11, provide regression coefﬁcients and their associated standard errors.

Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Low While there was some discussion about the potential for confounding effects in the
mortality study, such as with smoking, adjustments were not always made appropriately.
There was an attempt to control for smoking in examinations of lung cancer, but there
was no mention of this adjustment for endpoints such as NMRD. It is important to note
that a small portion of the participants in the mortality study were female. Some results
were indicated for the total group, while some were for the male participants only. In the
morbidity study, radiographic ﬁndings and their relationship with f-y were controlled for
both smoking and age. However, it was noted by the author that the association was hard
to measure "because of the small number of cases among non-smokers and the tendency
for most cases to be older, to have smoked, and to have a high f-y" (Amandus, 1986,
3100838). In the remainder of analyses, only age was controlled for.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium There was no information presented pertaining to the methods for validating the assess-
ment of potential confounders. However, there was no indication that the method had
poor validity.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low Both studies conducted are examining asbestos exposure and health outcomes amongst
vermiculite workers. However, it does not appear that the author is controlling for ver-
miculite exposure itself. While they mention that "vermiculite has not been associated
with signiﬁcant health effects" there is still a potential for some impact of vermiculite
dust on the workers (Amandus, 1986, 3100838), and it may have been beneﬁcial to con-
trol for.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The study design implemented is appropriate for the research question being examined.
The use of SMRs was appropriate to examine the association between asbestos exposure
and the various mortality outcomes in the mortality study.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The number of participants in both the morbidity and mortality studies was sufﬁcient to
detect an effect in the exposed population. It is important to note that in the morbidity
study, when looking at respiratory symptoms, "the number of cases were small and
statistical power was low" (Amandus, 1986, 3100838).
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The description of the analysis is sufﬁcient to understand how to conceptually reproduce
the analysis with access to the analytical data.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Low While some statistical models were used, there was no description of the model as-
sumptions present within this study. Assumptions for the regressions performed in the
morbidity study were not reported. However, the method for calculating SMRs in the
mortality analysis were described.

Additional Comments: It is important to note that this study was a dissertation. While the author examined both morbidity and mortality, some metrics were rated differently
due to differences in outcome ascertainment, analysis etc. Another potential concern pertains to comparison groups, as they differed depending on the
outcome being examined. It is important to note that for the mortality study, there were some female participants included. Some results were reported
for the included cohort as a whole, while others were reported speciﬁcally for male participants. While this study was given a medium rating based on the
calculated scores, there is potential for that to be downgraded to a low.The measurement exposure (M4) and/or exposure levels (M5) metrics are rated as
medium upon review by both set of reviewers. Also, the overall quality determination (OQD) is rated medium. Extraction has been completed and quality
control reviewed.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Low This study incorporated various sections, including both a morbidity and a mortality
study. For the morbidity study, the sample incorporated 191 men employed between
1975 and 1982 and had worked there for at least ten years. This group was incorporated
because over 50% of workers did not have radiographs available, due to either working
less than ﬁve years or being terminated before 1975. More details about the total number
of potential employees within the vermiculite mine/mill, participation rates, and speciﬁc
inclusion/exclusion criteria would be beneﬁcial for this study.
Metric 2: Attrition Medium The attrition level was somewhat higher in the morbidity study than in the mortality
study, with only 184 and 121 of the 191 men having radiographs and questionnaire
results available, respectively.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Low For the morbidity study, the author utilized an external control group for smoking, which
was comprised of three groups without asbestos exposure. These groups included blue-
collar workers without pneumoconiosis, non-asbestos cement plant workers, and coal
miners with less than ﬁve years of employment. Control group members were excluded
for various reasons, including if they had worked in a dusty trade, had a radiograph with
rounded opacities greater than 0/1, or never smoked regularly. It is important to note
that the coal miners were also excluded for the analysis examining a relationship be-
tween dyspnea and asbestos exposure. The author did not provide much of a discussion
pertaining to similarities between the exposed and control groups in this study, which
would have been beneﬁcial to ensure that analyses were conducted appropriately.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure High For the morbidity study, the date of the most recent radiograph examination was used
to calculate the cumulative exposure levels. As detailed in the section for the mortal-
ity study, air dust samples were collected at various timepoints in different areas of the
mill/mine. Midget impingers were used to sample the dust in years prior to 1969, and
these values were reported as million particles per cubic foot of air (mppcf). After 1967,
membrane ﬁlter samples were collected, and values were instead reported as ﬁbers per
cubic centimeter of air (f/cc). This information was used to generate a ﬁber-year esti-
mate for the individuals enrolled in the study. It is important to note that only samples
taken between 1965 and 1971 were used for these calculations. Several steps were un-
dertaken to determine job exposure estimates for the ﬁber-years accumulated for the
participants. These steps included coding the workers’ jobs and abstracting ﬁber concen-
trations, dividing the facility into various location-operations, determining the arithmetic
mean to compute average f/cc concentrations, converting impingers measurements into
appropriate units, estimating the exposure level at the various location-operations, utiliz-
ing a plant manager to estimate the hours worked at these locations, determining work
histories, and computing the individual participant"s cumulative exposure index. The
authors also detail that some of the area samples of airborne dust were analyzed with
phase contrast microscopy (Pearce, 1998, 3100838).
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The authors reported a wide range of exposure levels in both the morbidity and the mor-
tality studies. For example, Table 4.5 details radiographic ﬁndings by ﬁber-years, with
groupings of 0-15, 16-30, 31-85, and >86 f-y.
Metric 6: Temporality Medium There was a range of latency groups included in the morbidity and mortality studies.
While temporality is established for the participants, it is unclear if there was an ad-
equate level of follow-up for the consideration of latency. The average tenure for the
morbidity study was 14 years. Because the inclusion criteria required workers to have
been employed for at least one year, there is a wide range of potential latencies included
in this study.

toms were considered present if the participant gave an afﬁrmative answer to their ques-
tions pertaining to cough, phlegm, dyspnea, and wheezing. Because these were self-
reported, and there was no discussion of validation, the rating for this portion of the
morbidity study is uninformative.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low This metric is rated low because the studies or any cited methods source do not explic-
itly mention the use of PCM or TEM (Amandus et al., 1988, 783513; Armstrong et al.,
1988, 759132).This metric was also rated low for (Amandus & Wheeler, 1987, 29839),
as the methods section or any cited source did not explicitly mention the use of PCM
or TEM. However, one of the cited sources mentions TEM for mineralogical purposes,
unrelated to the determination of exposure estimates (Mcdonald et al., 1986, 29964).
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range and distribution of exposure is sufﬁcient to develop an adequate exposure-
response estimate, and three or more levels of exposure are reported (Amandus et al.,
1988, 783513; Armstrong et al., 1988, 759132; Amandus & Wheeler, 1987, 29839).
Additional Comments: This portion of the cohort was not evaluated because the methods section or any cited sources did not explicitly mention the use of PCM or TEM (Amandus
et al., 1988, 783513; Armstrong et al., 1988, 759132).One of the cited sources mentions TEM for mineralogical purposes, unrelated to the determination of
exposure estimates (Mcdonald et al., 1986, 29964).While the measurement of exposure metric (M4) methods used to quantify the exposure were not well
deﬁned, the exposure levels metric (M5) information reported was adequate to determine an exposure-response relationship.
??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation
Including Legacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos , to be considered as being informative for dose-response analysis, Metrics 4 and 5 would need metric ratings of Medium
or High. This reference did not satisfy this requirement; therefore a data quality evaluation was not conducted.

was further grouped into 0=no bodies, I= 1-10 bodies, II=11-100 bodies, and III= over
100 bodies. (Andrion et al. 1982, HERO ID: 3083914). The linked study used both
coated and uncoated ﬁbres. Uncoated ﬁbres are grouped by 0, 1-10,000, 10,001-50,000,
and>50,000. Coated ﬁbres are grouped by 0, 1-100, 101-1,000, and >1,000 (Andrion
et al. 1984, HERO ID: 3083599).
Additional Comments: Overall, this cohort reviews asbestos bodies and pleural plaques from autopsies. The linked study (Andrion et al. 1984, HERO ID: 3083599) lacks statistical
analyses, but the paret study (Andrion et al. 1982, HERO ID: 3083914) provides associations. While this cohort is ranked as a medium, it may better ﬁt as
a Low rating overall for its missing gaps in exposure assessment and limited analyses.
??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation
Including Legacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos , to be considered as being informative for dose-response analysis, Metrics 4 and 5 would need metric ratings of Medium
or High. This reference did not satisfy this requirement; therefore a data quality evaluation was not conducted.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Exposure to asbestos was determined to quantify concentration of asbestos ﬁbers in lung
tissue samples. Since an interview structure was utilized to determine general classiﬁca-
tions of asbestos exposure, there is no information on air concentrations of asbestos.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low There was no direct of asbestos ﬁbers using monitoring . Asbestos exposure information
was generated from asbestos ﬁber concentrations found in dried lung tissue samples
from the study participants.
Additional Comments: As the QC reviewer, I also rate this study medium for several reasons. This study used a job exposure matrix to estimate the level of asbestos exposure
into Deﬁnite Exposure, Probable Exposure, Possible Exposure, and Unlikely Exposure. The outcome of interest (lung cancer cases were conﬁrmed by
histological means). However, even though no direct air measurements were taken, the authors examined lung tissue samples of the participants to determine
ﬁbrosis, ﬁber type, etc. Those with signs of obstructive pneumonia were not included in the analysis. Table 3 includes information on the unadjusted and
adjusted odds ratios for various factors and their relation to lower lobe tumors.Overall, information on the measurement of exposure metric (M4) to assess
exposure was limited. Additionally, the exposure levels metric (M5) information reported was limited to determine exposure-response relationships.
?No biomarkers were identiﬁed for this evaluation.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Key elements of the study design were reported within this retrospective case study
of a subset of possible asbestosis cases obtained from a Japanese nationwide hospital
network that cares for asbestos workers. Of these cases (total number from hospital
network not detailed), only those with a lobectomy or autopsy specimen (total: n=33,
males: n=31, females: n=2; mean age at computed tomography (CT): 73 years) who
underwent high-resolution chest CT between May 2000 and July 2011 were selected
and enrolled for study. Of these, 30 cases underwent autopsy, and three cases had lobec-
tomies for lung cancer. Only those images of patients in stable condition and without
complications such as pneumonia or advanced lung cancer were evaluated. It is unclear
if the exposure-outcome distribution of those selected is representative of the target pop-
ulation as the total number of possible asbestosis cases within the hospital network was
not revealed, and only those cases with autopsy or pathology specimens, and potentially
higher exposures or more disease, were selected for study. Authors noted the potential
for selection bias.
Metric 2: Attrition Low Of the total hospital network possible asbestosis cases (number not detailed), only those
with lobectomy or autopsy specimens, in stable conditions and without complications,
were selected. The number of potential participants noted as possible asbestosis cases
but without lobectomy or autopsy specimens was not detailed.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium Inclusion criteria and methods of participant selection were reported and all subjects
were selected from the same eligible population within the same time frame. Demo-
graphic and other potentially relevant differences between subjects with differing levels
of asbestos body counts were not detailed, however Table 1 notes that age and work pe-
riod were not signiﬁcantly different between asbestosis and non-asbestosis groups. It is
unclear to what extent various aspects (such as healthy hire, healthy worker survivor) of
the healthy worker effect might have been a factor in the cohort for study.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure High Asbestos body counts were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range and distribution of asbestos body (AB) counts presented in Table 1 (AB mean
(SD) for the Asbestosis group (n=15): 1,464,711 (1,974822); non-Asbestosis group
(n=18): 98,745 (174,492)) is sufﬁcient to develop an exposure response relationship.
Correlation analyses utilized asbestos body counts as a continuous variable correlated
with asbestosis scores.

Metric 6: Temporality Medium This study establishes appropriate temporality within occupational histories, but it is
unclear if the interval between exposure and outcome is long enough for consideration
of latency of the outcome for those with 10 years of exposure as working years ranged
from 10 to 42 years (mean=24 years).
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationMedium Asbestosis: Outcomes of CT asbestosis score and pathological asbestosis score were
investigated. CT images of cases were reviewed by two independent, experienced (over
twenty years) radiologists aware of patient age and sex but blinded to pathological di-
agnoses and occupational histories, with disagreements resolved by a third experienced
(over twenty years) radiologist. Pleural disease scores were averaged across pulmonary
zones and the likelihood of asbestosis was designated for each case from a separate four-
point scale: 0=not asbestosis, 1=possible asbestosis, 2=probably asbestosis, 3=deﬁnite
asbestosis. Summation of the pleural disease and asbestosis likelihood scores provided
the ﬁnal CT-asbestosis score. Asbestosis diagnosis was made as in Akira et al., 2003
(HERO ID not available), and al-Jarad et al., (1992) (HERO ID not available). Authors
noted CT images were obtained in the supine position with potential for difﬁculty in
the analyses of ground-glass opacity and subpleural curvilinear lines. Radiologist inter-
observer agreements were 4.9 and 1.2 for ground glass opacity and curvilinear lines by
single determination standard deviation, respectively.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High There were no concerns for selective reporting as all outcomes which were outlined
within methods were also reported within the results. Correlations between asbestos
body counts and CT asbestosis and pathological asbestosis scores were reported as
correlation coefﬁcients with corresponding p-values.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Low Other than stratiﬁcation of mean ages across asbestosis and non-asbestosis groups in
Table 1, and the detail within the text regarding the total number of females (n=2), no
adjustments for gender, age or race appear to have been made within analyses and the
distribution of additional potentially relevant covariates and potential confounders was
not reported.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization N/A Covariates were not considered within ﬁnal correlational analyses.

Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low The members of the cohort were workers with varying occupations. Occupational histo-
ries included: asbestos-manufacturing (n=9), shipyard workers (n=8), asbestos-spraying
(n=4), boiler repair (n=2), insulation worker (n=2), plumbing worker (n=2) and others
(n=5). Authors noted that non-asbestosis cases included workers exposed to asbestos
as well as other kinds of dust, however additional details regarding these other kinds of
dust were not provided and co-exposures were not addressed. Considerations for work-
ers who might have initially left and worked elsewhere with additional exposures but
eventually returned to asbestos work were not detailed. However, there was no evidence
that there was an unbalanced provision of co-exposures among exposure groups.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The study design was appropriate as an initial study to address the research aims. The
correlations of asbestos body count and CT/pathological scores were evaluated with the
Spearman rank correlation coefﬁcient, however consideration for multivariate analyses
was not detailed. A value of p <0.05 was considered signiﬁcant. Additional analyses
were detailed for the agreement of CT and pathological scores, calculated by weighted
kappa statistics. The difference in CT scores between asbestosis and non-asbestosis
cases was evaluated by a non-parametric test (IBM SPSS Statistics ver. 22, Tokyo,
Japan).

Additional Comments: Cases of possible asbestosis were obtained from a Japanese nationwide hospital network that cares for asbestos workers in this retrospective case study.
Of these cases (total number from hospital network not detailed), only those with a pathologic lobectomy or autopsy specimen (total: n=33, males:
n=31, females: n=2; mean age at computed tomography (CT): 73 years) who underwent high-resolution chest CT between May 2000 and July 2011

patients in stable condition and without complications such as pneumonia or advanced lung cancer were evaluated. Outcomes of CT asbestosis score and
pathological asbestosis score were investigated. The number of asbestos bodies, not the number of asbestos ﬁbers, were counted by experienced technicians
described as within participating institutions and utilizing transmission electron microscopy (TEM) asbestos counting methods as within Koyama et al.,
1991 (HERO ID 709715). Occupational histories included: asbestos-manufacturing (n=9), shipyard workers (n=8), asbestos-spraying (n=4), boiler repair
(n=2), insulation worker (n=2), plumbing worker (n=2) and others (n=5). Working years ranged from 10 to 42 years (mean=24 years). Asbestos body
count positively correlated with CT likelihood of asbestosis (r=0.503, p=0.003), and with the pathological asbestosis score (r=0.637, p <0.001) (Figures 4
and 5). CT-asbestosis score and pathological asbestosis score also showed a signiﬁcant positive correlation (r=0.656, p <0.001).

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Dust concentration measurements were taken periodically at the mine and mill. A ko-
niometer, which is a device used to estimate the amount of dust in the air, was utilized
between 1948 and 1958. This only measured total dust per cubic centimeter (ppcc), and
it had an upper limit of 1,000 ppcc. This limit was often exceeded. A survey was under-
taken to determine the concentration of airborne crocidolite ﬁbers greater than 5 microns
in length in 1966. A Casella long running thermal precipitator was used to generate the
data. A Casella gravimetric dust sampler and a Hexhelt were also used to estimate dust
mass. No impingers or PCM/TEM were utilized in this study.This metric is rated low
because the studies or any cited methods source do not explicitly mention the use of
PCM or TEM (Armstrong et al., 1988, 3083076; Reid et al., 2018, 6874474).

Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The ﬁgures included in the Armstrong et al., 1988, (HERO ID: 3083076) paper displays
several mortality outcomes amongst the miners and millers at various exposure levels.
They are split into groups as follows: <10 f/cc y, 10-100 f/cc y, and >100 f/cc y. They
also include all exposures combined, which includes unknown exposures.The levels of
exposure in the Reid et al. 2018 (HERO ID: 6874474) paper included <10 f/mL years,
10-50 f/mL years, and >50. These values allow for the development of an exposure-
response estimate.
Additional Comments: NOTE: This cohort was rated "Low" for Metric 4, and thus does not meet the criteria for usefulness for dose-response. Only outcome inventory, ﬁber
types, and Metrics 4 and 5 received a QC.There were several limitations in this paper. One of the primary concerns pertains to the use of an appropriate
comparison group. The authors also did not discuss potential covariates to be included in the models, and the two different methods used to calculate SMRs
may also introduce bias into the results.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Cohort study, Ex-workers from a single asbestos mining and milling company who
worked for the company for at least one year were invited to participate. Study pop-
ulation was separated into 3 groups whose working conditions improved over time:
group I (1940"66, n = 180), group II (1967"76, n = 1317), and group III (1977"96, n =
2137). From the 6098 eligible subjects, 433 (7.1% ) were found to bedead (148, 184,
and 101 subjects for groups I, II, and III,respectively); 3634 of the remaining 5665 were
actuallyexamined (64.1% ). The rate of recruitment success variedbetween the differ-
ent groups: group I=46.1% (180/390alive), group II=67.5% (1317/1950), and group
III=64.2% (2137/3325) (table 1).
Metric 2: Attrition Medium 121 lung function tests did not meet quality criteria and were not included in the study.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium The demographic and occupational variables differed signiﬁcantly among the groups.
Thus, group III subjects were younger and presented with a shorter latency than their
counterparts of groups I and II (table 1). Higher cumulative exposure was also found in
group I subjects compared to groups II and III. Subject numbers in group 1 n=180 com-
pared to group 2 n=1317 and group 3 n=2137. Difference reported between exposure
groups were controlled for.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Participants were split into three groups depending on when their exposure occurred.
Group III had routine measurements of asbestos ﬁbers, which were obtained by airborne
samples from different areas of activity using a constant-ﬂow sampler. A membrane
ﬁlter was used to collect the ﬁbers and the counting was done with a phase contrast
microscope (PCM).
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Tables 2 and 3 use binary exposure groups (i.e. less than 10 ﬁbers/y/cc, or greater than
or equal to 10 ﬁbers/y/cc.) Tables 4 and 6 include a continuous measure of cumulative
exposure (but this is not a robust analysis due to not considering confounders). The
graphs in Figure 2 report three exposure levels (highest quartile, IQR, and lowest quar-
tile).
Metric 6: Temporality High Latency differed across groups, however at the time of the present evaluation, more than
half of group III workers already had a latency time of at least 20 years. Included in
analysis was Group I (1940"66, n = 107), group II (1967"76, n = 930), and group III
(1977"96, n = 713).

metric tests, which were performed with a calibrated pneumo tacograph (Fleisch No. 3).
The subjects completed at least three acceptable maximal forced expiratory manoeuvres:
technical procedures, acceptability, and reproducibility criteria were those recommended
by the American Thoracic Society.; Pleural Plaques: Standard high-kilovoltage, pos-
teroanterior CRX were obtained, with radiographs classiﬁed by 3 chest physicians (2
B-readers and 1 A-reader) up to September 1999; after September 1999 one B-reader
was replaced by a radiologist with 18 years’ experience. Readers were blinded as to
exposure status. Radiographs were interpreted using ILO standards; parenchymal opac-
ities were reported if ILO reading was 1/0 or more. Profusion readings were reported as
median values. Presence of pleural plaques also assessed.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High The authors wanted to examine mortality but report that they were unable to due to
a lack of reliability in death certiﬁcates. Additionally, the study reports information
graphically but has point estimates reported in either the footnotes of graphs or in the
text of the paper.

(1940"66, n = 107), group II (1967"76, n = 930), and group III (1977"96, n = 713).
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium All analyses appear reproducible.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium The discussion of normality implies they did assess one of the assumptions for linear
regression. A backward stepwise linear regression procedure was also used for analysing
the relation of the spirometric variables to latency, cumulative exposure, smoking (pack-
years), and radiographic abnormalities. Probability of type I error was established at
0.05 for all tests. Cumulative probability model in Figure 2

Additional Comments: A standardized occupational history was administered by interview, detailing the start and end of exposure, the speciﬁc workplace(s), and the estimated
level of exposure (groups I and II) (Bagatin et al. 2004, HERO ID: 2078960). Groups I and II did not have routine systematic asbestos measurements, and
thus a "subjective, logarithmic scale" was used to estimate indices of exposure based on ﬁber measurements before the development of routine measures.
Participants self-identiﬁed their level of workplace dustiness as mild (0.3-3 ﬁbers/cc), moderate (3-30 ﬁbers/cc), or severe (more than 30 ﬁbers/cc). Group
I differed signiﬁcantly in terms of size, latency, cumulative exposure and age. Dyspnea, wheezing, cough, phlegm were also assessed as was radiographic
abnormalities (Bagatin et al. 2004, HERO ID: 2078960). Other study in other cohort revealed, however, that CXR compared to Thin-section CT was
associated with false-positives for interstitial abnormalities and false-negatives for pleural plaques, regardless of the intensity of asbestos exposure (Terra-
Filho et al. 2015, HERO ID: 3077807).

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low The authors measured asbestos ﬁbers in lung tissue of the subjects during necropsy,
which represented a measure of cumulative exposure to asbestos over the lifetime. The
authors did not collect primary or secondary data of asbestos ﬁbers’ concentration in
the occupational exposure environment. The authors used SEM and what appears to
be optical microscopy to quantify exposure, but this cannot be conﬁrmed as the cited
method is in Italian (Istituto Superiore di Sanit", 2017).
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The authors reported summary statistics representing four different levels of exposure
associated with the pleural plaques’ extension grades that are adequate for the devel-
opment of an exposure-response relationship. (Table 1; millions of asbestos ﬁbres and

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium This study examined the relationship between prevalent respiratory symptoms (chronic
cough, chronic phlegm, chronic bronchitis, dyspnea) assessed through standardized in-
terviews and asbestos exposure as represented by length of employment (years, range:
1-27 years), estimated cumulative exposure to total particles (particles/cc years), and
estimated cumulative exposure to asbestos ﬁbers (ﬁbers/cc years) in asbestos workers
(n=1127) engaged in asbestos mining, asbestos cement production, production of fric-
tion materials or the manufacture of asbestos textiles versus age-matched non-exposed
controls (n=593).
Metric 2: Attrition High Characteristics, in terms of relevant variables of those possibly excluded due to miss-
ing outcome or exposure data, were not reported, however there was no indication that
missing data or subject drop-out was an issue within this study.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium The control group (n=281) was described as having no known occupational exposure
to airborne particles or irritant gases. Control subjects were described as age-matched
(methods not speciﬁed) to asbestos male workers; however, text notes males and females
were part of the exposed worker group (n=230 female nonsmoking asbestos workers).
This study was restricted to employees working at the time of study and assessment of
prevalent outcomes. It is unclear if healthy hire or healthy worker survivor effects were
appreciable within this study which examined prevalent respiratory symptoms within a
population with 1-27 years of employment exposure.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure High Quantitative exposure measurements (1971-1974) of total airborne particulates and
asbestos ﬁbers were performed simultaneously during typical work cycles and were
described in terms of equipment, procedures and referenced (Valic et al., 1988, foreign
reference number 15 in text). Number of samples varied and time of sample collection
ranged from 1 minute to three hours, depending on dust level. Asbestos exposure ana-
lytic methods utilized phase contrast illumination. Final estimated cumulative exposures
calculations were based on mean measured concentrations measured during typical work
cycles during all work shifts during two seasons, estimated duration of exposures, es-
timated weighted daily exposures for each typical work operation and complete work
histories for each worker. Exposures in control subjects not detailed, however controls
had no known occupational asbestos exposure.

Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Measured (1971-1974) asbestos ﬁber concentrations (f/cc) were reported within Table
1 for each mine and factory work category and ranged from 0.3 " 62.0 f/cc for six cate-
gories of exposure. Summary measures of estimated cumulative exposures were detailed
in Figure 1 footnote description of asbestos exposure categories and ranged from zero
ﬁbers/cc years to greater than 80 ﬁbers/cc years. The range and distribution of exposure
appeared adequate.
Metric 6: Temporality Low This study was restricted to employees working at the time of study and outcomes were
those prevalent at time of assessment (dates of outcome assessment not provided). The
temporality of exposure-outcome relationships is uncertain due to the cross-sectional
nature of respiratory symptom outcome assessment within this study.
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationMedium Other Non-Cancer Outcomes: Respiratory symptom outcomes of interest included
prevalence of self-reported chronic cough, chronic phlegm, chronic bronchitis and
dyspnea as assessed by standardized interview questionnaire, which was noted to be
a modiﬁed form of the British Medical Research Council Questionnaire. Validation of
outcomes was not reported, and results were participant reported, however there is no
indication that methods had poor validity.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium There were no concerns for selective reporting as all outcomes which were outlined
within methods were also reported within the results. The results within Figure 1 were
reported only as p-values for each level of exposure speciﬁed within ﬁgure footnotes,
with details regarding number of participants, conﬁdence intervals and standard errors
lacking.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control

and female asbestos workers were included within analyses, however considerations
for control of gender within analyses was lacking. Analyses within Tables 2-4 were
restricted to those within categories of smokers and non-smokers. A distribution of
demographic characteristics of exposed and control workers was presented.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium While the methods utilized to obtain and validate data regarding potential confounders

Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium Statistical analysis of the data within this study was not detailed within the text. Table 2
results for asbestos workers and controls indicate use of chi-square analyses for obtain-
ing p-values, however statistical analyses for Figure 1 results are not detailed.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The number of subjects (n=1127 asbestos workers, n=593 controls) appeared adequate
for this analysis, although the number of subjects within each category of exposure
within Figure 1 was not detailed.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Low Statistical analysis methods were not reported and details such as rules for classiﬁcation
of smoking categories, consideration of outliers, transformation of continuous variables
and methods for dealing with missing data were not detailed.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Low The description of statistical analysis was very brief and is only inferred from Table 2 as
consisting of chi-square analyses.
Additional Comments: This study examined the relationship between prevalent respiratory symptoms (chronic cough, chronic phlegm, chronic bronchitis, dyspnea) assessed
through standardized interviews and asbestos exposure as represented by length of employment (years, range: 1-27 years), estimated cumulative exposure
to total particles (particles/cc years), and estimated cumulative exposure to asbestos ﬁbers (ﬁbers/cc years) in asbestos workers (n=1127) engaged in
asbestos mining, asbestos cement production, production of friction materials or the manufacture of asbestos textiles versus age-matched non-exposed
controls (n=593). Exposure was measured 1971-1974 and estimates of cumulative exposure were calculated utilizing these measurements as well as
detailed complete work histories of each worker. Dates of assessment of respiratory outcomes through standardized interview questionnaire not speciﬁed.
Results indicated a statistically signiﬁcant relationship between prevalence of respiratory symptoms and duration of employment (Fig. 1A, p <0.01), total
particles/cc years (Fig. 1B, p <0.01). The relationship between prevalence of respiratory symptoms and exposure expressed by measured asbestos ﬁbers/cc
years was not signiﬁcant (Fig. 1C, P >0.05).

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low The study uses job-speciﬁc questionnaires (including JEM) to determine exposure;
however, the authors are not clear whether the categories of exposure were based on
PCM or TEM conversion factors. It appears that exposure was determined solely using
professional judgement.This metric is rated low because the study or any cited methods
source does not explicitly mention the use of PCM or TEM.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low The authors provide the range of exposures; however, the information is very limited.
The distribution of exposures is only provided indirectly in comparing two of the differ-
ent exposure methods (i.e., Table 2).
Additional Comments: NOTE: This study would not have been evaluated under the current guidelines. Metric 4 was rated as low because there was no mention of PCM or TEM

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low This metric is rated Low because the study or any cited methods source does not ex-
plicitly mention the use of PCM or TEM. dust concentrations were measured using
koniometer between 1948 and 1958. In 1966, ﬁber counting was done using a Casella
long running thermal precipitator. Personal and ﬁxed monitors were utilized in 1973.
Additional measurements were taken in 1977, 1978, 1980, 1984, 1986, and 1992, us-
ing interpolation to estimate concentrations for years that surveys were not conducted.
According to Hansen et al., 1997 2219991, all samples examined were analyzed using
the standard membrane ﬁlter method. Some exceptions were surveys in 1984 and 1986
which used SEM, and in 1992 which used TEM. Although later surveys utilized TEM,
the current study does not describe estimates in a way to know outcomes based on expo-

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection High The authors reference three previous studies of white male textile workers from a
chrysotile asbestos plant in South Carolina (Dement et al., 1982, HEROID: 65; Dement
et al., 1983, HEROID: 66; Dement et al., 1983, HEROID: 67). In the original analyses,
the white male workers were required to be employed for at least one month between
January 1, 1940-Decemeber 31, 1965. This study updates the cohort to include all work-
ers who were employed at least one month, and follow-up vital status extended by 15
years, updating from 1975-1990. The authors discuss using death ﬁles from "the Social
Security Administration, the National Death Index, and the ﬁles of the Internal Rev-
enue Service" (Brown et al., 1994, HEROID: 3081832). Black women employes were
excluded due to the small number (n=19). Overall, the updated cohort included 3,022
workers (1,229 white women, 1,247 white men, and 546 black men).
Metric 2: Attrition High Authors note that 22.8% of white women from the plant were lost to follow-up as their
vital status could not be conﬁrmed. Authors found that most of these women were those
employed for a shorter amount of time: "54% worked less than 6 months, 17% worked
between 6 months and 1 year, and 29% worked longer than 1 year"(Brown et al., 1994,
HEROID: 3081832). Of the black men employed in the plant, 7.8% were lost to follow-
up, and 1.5% of white men were lost to follow-up. Additionally, 11% of white women,
7.6% of black men, and 2.8% of white men were presumed dead, but their death certiﬁ-
cates were not obtained. These workers were assumed alive in the analyses.
Metric 3: Comparison Group High The South Carolina death rate was used to calculate expected deaths and the SMRs.
Additionally, outcomes are stratiﬁed by race/gender.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Individual lifetime cumulative exposure to asbestos was estimated using data from De-
ment et al. (1983, HERO ID: 66), which clariﬁes that 5,952 environmental samples were
used covering the period of 1930-1975 using impingers until 1965, impingers and mem-
brane ﬁlter samples between 1965 and 1971, and membrane ﬁlter samples exclusively
from 1971-1975. Another study from the same cohort, Richardson et al. (2018, HERO
ID: 6860087) clariﬁes that the approach used phase-contrast microscopy (PCM) for ﬁber
counting (as evidenced by the citation of Edwards and Lynch, 1968, HEROID: 783893).
The impinger and membrane ﬁlter samples that were taken concurrently (n=1,106 pairs)
were used to create conversion between the two types of data, resulting in a conversion
factor of 2.9 ﬁbers to one mpccf. Detailed job histories were also collected to calculate
individual exposure estimates, which took into account the dust concentration for the
job an individual worked at, the time spent in the job, and the number of jobs held. Data
came from personnel records.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium In SMR analysis, 7 different exposure levels are used which represent values of ﬁbers/
cm^ 3 days that range from <500 to >100,000.
Metric 6: Temporality High In the original study, workers had to be employed for at least one month at any time
from January 1940- December 1975 (Dement et al., 1982, HEROID: 65; Dement et al.,
1983, HEROID: 66; Dement et al., 1983, HEROID: 67). This study adds an additional

personnel records were ﬁrst maintained beginning in approximately 1930. Therecord
system has remained remarkably unchanged since that time. For each worker,an em-
ployment card was completed at initial employment giving name, date of birth,sex, race,
social security number, marital status and address. This same card alsocontained the
detailed work history giving exact dates of employment by plantdepartment and speciﬁc
job. All information from these cards was entered onto acomputer data ﬁle."

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Exposure was estimated using a combination of job exposure matrices and available
measurements. A total of 1024 measurements of asbestos levels were available, along
with detailed information on processes and exposures in each department from industrial
hygienists and engineers from each mill. Both were used by an international team of in-
dustrial hygienists to quantitatively estimate exposure, who developed mill-, department-
, and time-speciﬁc assessments. Details on equipment used and measures from each mill
were not provided. The likelihood of substantial exposure misclassiﬁcation cannot be
readily ascertained; there is no evidence suggesting differential error is likely.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Exposure concentrations were quantiﬁed in three levels as low (average 0.001 ﬁbers/
cm3), medium (0.01 f/cc) and high (0.10 f/cc). Cumulative exposure in f/cc-years was
then calculated by multiplying exposure intensity by the duration of exposure in years.
A weighted cumulative exposure measure incorporated prevalence of exposure.
Additional Comments: This study analyzed associations between occupational asbestos exposure and lung and pleural cancer mortality in a 13-country cohort of 62,937 male pulp
and paper workers employed for at least 1 year between 1945 and 1996. Exposure in this industry is predominantly from maintenance and repair work.
Exposure estimates used available dust measures and paper mill-speciﬁc information on exposure probabilities in each department. In internal analyses,
pleural but not lung cancer was signiﬁcantly associated with ever exposure to asbestos, and non-signiﬁcantly associated with higher years of exposure, years
since ﬁrst exposure, and cumulative exposure. Higher cumulative exposure was also non-signiﬁcantly associated with increased risk of lung cancer (n=450
in the cohort). Only 24 pleural cancers were identiﬁed, 10 in subjects classiﬁed as unexposed although several worked in departments where exposure may
occur. While there is no evidence of differential error, non-differential exposure misclassiﬁcation may have attenuated associations. The authors also note
that the mean follow up of 23.5 years may not have been sufﬁcient to fully identify pleural cancers, which have an extremely long latency.Information
on the measurement of exposure metric (M4) to assess exposure was limited and rated low. On the other hand, exposure levels metric (M5) information
reported was adequate/rated medium to determine exposure-response relationships. The overall rating for this outcome/study is medium.
?No biomarkers were identiﬁed for this evaluation.
??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low This metric is rated Low because the study or any cited methods source does not ex-
plicitly mention the use of PCM or TEM. Final regression modeling results in Table 4
included cumulative exposure estimates to respirable ﬁbers (ﬁbers/mL), asbestos (ﬁbers/
mL), talc (ﬁbers/mL), formaldehyde (ppm), respirable silica (mg/m^ 3), and asphalt
fumes (mg/m^ 3). Estimates of daily exposure to each of the substances over a worker"s
entire working lifetime were formulated from personal (proxy) interview occupational
history, detailed historical environmental reconstruction by year through engineering
process history (1938-1987), historical department job code titles, process-speciﬁc
chemical exposure analyses, industrial hygiene (IH) records (described as available
from about 1970 onwards) and employee work histories. The engineering process his-
tory was compiled by four Owens-Corning Fiberglass engineers and audited by process
division experts for validity. Assignment of department to process code was blinded to
case and control status. Authors noted few IH records existed for early, pre-1970 pro-
cesses and an exposure assessment committee of current and former Owens-Corning
Fiberglass employees with knowledge of IH, current and historical plant processes was
established to develop quantitative estimates of potential exposures to each substance
for each process by assigning each process to one of four ranges of estimated potential
exposure (eight-hour time weighted average (TWA) exposures speciﬁc to calendar time,
Table 1). Cumulative exposure to each substance for these employees was developed for
each employee as the product of the number of days in a process multiplied by the mid-
point of the exposure range and summed over all processes. Authors did not discuss the
potential for exposure misclassiﬁcation within these methods, but the misclassiﬁcation
was likely non-differential.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range and distribution of estimated exposure (Table 4, four categories for asbestos
and three categories for talc estimated exposures) was sufﬁcient to develop exposure-
response estimates.

Additional Comments: This occupational nested case-control study investigated the relationship between multiple exposures within cases of non-malignant (n=101) respiratory
disease mortality and matched controls (n=183) obtained from the Thermal Insulation Manufacturer"s Association (TIMA) historical cohort mortality
study of production and maintenance workers employed at the Newark, Ohio ﬁberglass manufacturing plant for at least one year between 1 January 1940
and 31 December 1962 and followed up to the end of 1982. There is potential for Healthy Worker Survivor bias, indicated by results stratiﬁed by years
of employment. For non-malignant respiratory disease, only smoking was statistically signiﬁcant with OR = 2.637 (95% CI, 1.146-6.069). None of the
exposure variables produced signiﬁcant OR"s but higher OR"s were found for the higher ranked asbestos exposure levels.
?No biomarkers were identiﬁed for this evaluation.
??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation
Including Legacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos , to be considered as being informative for dose-response analysis, Metrics 4 and 5 would need metric ratings of Medium
or High. This reference did not satisfy this requirement; therefore a data quality evaluation was not conducted.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium This study included workers from a Marysville, Ohio plant which used Libby amphibole
asbestos. There was a study that examined pulmonary effects in 512 workers, conducted
in 1980 (participation rates in Lockey et al., 1984 029685). The examination included
physical exams, spirometry, and chest x-rays. Information on smoking, work, and ex-
posure histories were collected. In 2002-2005, another follow-up study was conducted,
and included 280 of the original individuals. They participated in interviews and re-
ceived chest x-rays. The authors detail that they wanted to limit potential exposures in
other occupational settings, so the total number of individuals included in the analysis
was 118. They all began working in 1972 or later. The authors did not provide a ro-
bust description of the participation rate for this study, nor a comparison of participant
characteristics or the prevalence of pleural thickening in included vs excluded subjects.
However, there was no evidence of potential selection bias.
Metric 2: Attrition Medium To exclude potential error due to poorly measured occupational exposure prior to 1972,
this analysis limited the sample to workers hired after 1972, including 118 (42.1% ) of
280 workers included in a previous analysis of the same data (Rohs et al 2008, 709486).
In contrast to the earlier study, this paper did not compare characteristics of this subset
of participants vs. eligible living workers who were non-participants (e.g., age, exposure
level, smoking status). The earlier study also conducted sensitivity analyses to assess
the impact of attrition from the parent study (n=512) by adding the 151 eligible living
non-participants (assuming they had no pleural changes) to the model; conclusions did
not change. The potential impact of any attrition bias was not discussed here.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium Because of the nature of the analyses conducted in this study, subgroups were compared
against each other (i.e., a within-cohort analysis). Smoking and nonsmoking groups
were reported to be similar in age at x-ray and time from ﬁrst exposure. However, fur-
ther discussion about similarities between the two groups was somewhat limited.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure High The authors detail that estimates of exposure through 2000 were developed through
several methods, including ﬁber measurements when available, and estimated ﬁber con-
centrations. For this cohort, the most accurate exposure data comes from 1972 onward,
because analytical measurements were used. According to the cited study (Rohs et al.,
2008, ID: 709486), airborne ﬁbers were collected on membrane ﬁlters. The Rohs et al.
study cites another study in their methods section which details the use of transmission
electron microscopy for exposure measurements, contributing to the high rating for this
metric (Lockey et al., 1984, 29685). Prior to 1976, hygienists followed workers with a
sampling device to gather information about various departments. Information on the
year of hire and speciﬁc locations where individuals worked were used to determine a
cumulative exposure, reported in ﬁbers/cc-year.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range and distribution of exposures presented in this study are sufﬁcient to develop
an exposure-response estimate. Table 1 presents the mean as 0.42, with a standard devia-
tion of 0.77 ﬁbers/cc-year. The range was reported as 0.001-5.51 ﬁbers/cc-year.
Metric 6: Temporality High The interval between the exposure and the outcome is sufﬁciently long considering the
latency period for asbestos exposure. Table 1 reports that the average time since ﬁrst
exposure was 28.2 years, with a standard deviation of 2.5 years. The range was reported
as 23.2-32.6 years since ﬁrst exposure.
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationHigh Pleural Plaques: See Other: Localized Pleural Thickening. From the manuscript: "In
the current International Labour Organization (ILO) classiﬁcation, LPT includes both
pleural plaques (focal areas of pleural thickening generally present at the parietal pleura,
diaphragm or chest wall) and pleural thickening that does not involve blunting of the
costophrenic angle between the rib cage and the diaphragm."; Other Non-Cancer Out-
comes: The authors detail that "three board-certiﬁed radiologists blinded to any identi-
fying information, independently classiﬁed the radiographs using the ILO classiﬁcation
system" (Christensen & Kopylev, 2012). The authors did not report the rate of agree-
ment between readers, but this is a well-established method. The authors did highlight
in the discussion section that one of the limitations of this study was a lack of BMI in-
formation for all participants. Some "fat pads may be mistaken for pleural thickening"
(Christensen & Kopylev, 2012).
Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium The results were presented in the text and included details on model ﬁtting and evalua-
tion steps, p-values that informed decisions about variables included in the ﬁnal model,
model ﬁt indices, and the benchmark dose (BMC) calculated using the ﬁnal model.
BMCs (the dose associated with a 10% increase in risk) were presented for the full sam-
ple, smokers, and non-smokers. However, coefﬁcients from the models were not shown.

Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment High The authors considered numerous covariates in their analyses. Time from ﬁrst expo-
sure, age at x-ray, gender, and BMI were all considered for inclusion in the models; none
reached signiﬁcance. The "covariates were evaluated according to the statistical signif-
icance of the covariate, and whether inclusion of the covariate improved model ﬁt as
assessed by the AIC" (Christensen & Kopylev, 2012). Smoking history was included in
the ﬁnal models, and interactions between smoking and asbestos exposure examined, in
keeping with the study aim of evaluating the impact of smoking on the asbestos BMC
for pleural thickening.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium There is no evidence to suggest poor validity of variables assessed as potential con-
founders . Confounders were characterized based on employee records, a screening
exam, and either in-person or telephone interviews. The potential inﬂuence of missing
data for BMI was considered in sensitivity analyses.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Medium The authors did not discuss potential co-exposures within the occupational setting in this
manuscript. However this issue was addressed in the manuscript analyzing the baseline
cohort: Lockey et al 1984, 029685 reported that a careful evaluation did not identify any
co-exposures that would cause pleural radiographic changes.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The study design and methods employed were appropriate for the research question
being examined. The candidate models used were provided, and the rationale for issues
such as the variables included and exposure lags selected was given.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The analysis sample included only 12 cases and 106 non-cases. Power may have been
inadequate to detect statistically signiﬁcant interactions.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium A thorough description of the analyses performed is included in this study. The descrip-
tion is sufﬁcient to be able to conceptually understand how to reproduce the analyses
performed.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium The models included in this study are transparent, and it appears as though model as-
sumptions have been met.
Additional Comments: Overall, the authors provided a lot of detail within this study, and they were explicit about the analyses and model ﬁt criteria used. The quality of both
exposure and outcome assessments was high, potential confounding was examined in depth, and there was lengthy follow-up. However, the small sample
size limited statistical power and results were presented only as benchmark doses, without additionally providing model coefﬁcients. In addition, the
potential inﬂuence of any selection bias is uncertain: only 118 of the initial 512 workers in the cohort, and of the 431 alive at the time of X-rays, were
included due to the stringent criteria needed to minimize exposure measurement error.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Methods for ﬁber count included ﬁber morphology and ﬁber chemistry determined
through energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, followed by calculating ﬁber concentra-
tion using an algorithm that accounted for weight of lung tissue used in the study and
number of grid squares. However, authors did not utilize PCM or TEM, thus warranting
a low rating per the guidance.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low Actual measured exposure data were not available for the cases and are estimations
based on historic data and calculations. Authors stated that exposure was not included
in their models as they felt combining years of exposure with ﬁber burden did not make
sense analytically nor is there a correlation between the two.
Additional Comments: 2/6/2023 UPDATE: DUE TO CHANGES IN THE GUIDANCE FOR SQE, ALL METRICS RATINGS EXCEPT FOR 4 AND 5 SHOULD BE IGNORED
BECAUSE METRIC 4 AND 5 WERE RATED "LOW".Authors stated crocidolite ﬁbers were detected in a small number of cases but were excluded from
analyses. Examining the association between chrysotile or tremolite with disease was not conducted due to low concentrations, but concentrations are
reported.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low There is no detail regarding the measurement of exposure in this study, but a reference
to Paris et al., 2009 (Paris et al., 2009, HEROID 758968). There, authors describe the
use of a questionnaire and an a priori job-exposure matrix to calculate a cumulative
exposure index. This paper and the paper by Paris et al., 2009 lack and detail of as-
bestos sample measurements or quantiﬁcation.Authors describe using four classes for
levels of exposure: "lowlevel (passive exposure), corresponding to a numerical value
of "0.01equivalent ﬁbers/mL"; low-intermediate, corresponding to a numericalvalue
of"0.1 equivalent ﬁbers/mL"; high-intermediate, corresponding toa numerical value of
"1 equivalent ﬁbers/mL"; and high exposure,corresponding to a numerical value of "10
equivalent ﬁbers/mL" (Paris et al., 2009, HEROID 758968). A ﬁnal cumulative exposure
index was calculated as the sum of each job’s four-level CEI for each subject.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Final models report 6 levels of exposure: unexposed, 0-3.3 f-y/mL, 3.3-13.5 f-y/ml,

Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium This ecological analysis in the San Francisco-Oakland Metropolitan Statistical Area
(SMSA) examined how standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for cancer in 1969-1974
varied by level of chrysotile asbestos in residential water samples. Exposure was esti-
mated and cases identiﬁed for all 722 census tracts in the SMSA (1970 population >3
million). The SMSA is characterized by distinct water supply sources, some of which
came from aquifers or reservoirs exposed to naturally occurring serpentine rock " the
ofﬁcial state rock of California and the parent form of chrysotile asbestos. Water supply
asbestos concentrations were estimated for 410 SMSA "super tracts" used to combine
the tracts used in 1960 and 1970 censuses. Newly diagnosed cancers were obtained from
surveys that comprehensively compiled data on cancers in the SMSA during the en-
tire period, which included census tract information. Possible ecological study biases:
Potential bias due to SES differences across super tracts was addressed by calculating
SIRs cross-classiﬁed by median income or education as well as by exposure. The au-
thors ensured that there were adequate numbers of tracts in each stratum (mostly n 50).
Confounding due to super tract group differences in potential occupational exposure was
addressed using models that adjusted for the percentage of construction, electrical and
textile workers in each tract.
Metric 2: Attrition Medium As this study was cross-sectional and ecological, attrition was not a concern. The au-
thors estimated the 1972 population – the midpoint of the period for which cancer inci-
dence data were used – using available census data.
Metric 3: Comparison Group High Both the expected and observed cancer rates used to derive SIRs were calculated us-
ing the estimated 1972 SMSA population, ensuring comparability. Expected cancer
incidence rates for the entire SMSA were calculated using an age, race (white vs non),
and sex-speciﬁc population estimate for January 1972, extrapolated from 1960 and
1970 censuses. Observed cases were compiled in 5-year age groups for each super tract.
These values were compared to the numbers of expected cancers based on the age, race,
and sex population of that super tract.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Exposure estimates used 353 water samples previously collected to represent the wa-
ter distribution systems along with 19 additional samples (Kanarek et al 1980, RefID
60569). The mean of samples from each distribution area was assigned to all super tracts
in that area. Exposure was assigned independently by personnel with no knowledge of
cancer incidence across census tracts. In addition to household taps, analyses were made
on raw and ﬁnished water at treatment plants and several stored historical samples to
reﬂect exposure over 40 years. Water districts were subdivided to the extent possible by
source, treatment process and/or pressure zones. Fibers were counted by ﬁltering wa-
ter through 0.45 mm ﬁlters and using TEM, with analysts blinded to the source of each
sample and several samples analyzed in duplicate. When results were below detectable
limits, the lowest detectable limit was used (usually 10^ 4 ﬁbers/liter), vs a fraction such
as half the detection limit. This approach likely inﬂated exposure estimates. Sources of
measurement error that could not be addressed include the lack of information on resi-
dential drinking water intake, water intake from other sources (e.g., work, school), and
use of bottled water or water ﬁlters (less common at the time than today). The authors
did not mention the prevalence of asbestos cement pipes, or the prevalence households
not connected to the public water supply. Possible ecological study biases: To evalu-
ate risk of bias due to heterogeneity in drinking water asbestos concentrations within
super tracts, the authors examined variability across random households within a se-
lected tract, within a distribution system (from treatment plant to household tap), and at
different times of day during high use. The authors described consistently ﬁnding very
little variability. Secondly, potential bias due to population mobility (i.e., changes in
residence and thus exposure) was examined in a sensitivity analysis limiting the sam-
ple to tracts in which more than 50% of the population aged >5y resided in the same
household in 1965 and 1970.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The authors used 3 categories of exposure in most analyses, each including more than
100 super tracts. Multiple tracts had common water systems and identical ﬁber counts,
resulting in gaps in the boundary values deﬁning these categories.
Metric 6: Temporality Medium The study was cross-sectional, using predominantly recent measures of drinking water
asbestos to characterize exposure. Given the long latency of many cancers, the authors
report that they incorporated a few historical water samples to estimate past exposure,
but no details were provided (number, timing, distribution, concentrations).

Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationHigh Lung Cancer: The outcome database included 51,314 incidence cases obtained from a
registry compiled by the San Francisco Bay Area Resource for Cancer Epidemiology
(RCE). The registry included all newly diagnosed cancers collected for the Third Na-
tional Cancer Survey (TNCS) 1969-1971 and subsequently for an RCE survey for 1972-
1974 that collected comparable data. Over 90% of the cancers were microscopically
conﬁrmed. Codes for each cases included age, sex, race, body site, hospital, diagnosis
method and date, and census tract. ICD 8 codes were used to classify cancers. However,
the authors did not provide case counts. The number of cases available is relevant to
evaluate the robustness of ﬁndings for very rare outcomes such as pleural cancer. Lung
cancer: histological subtypes were assessed (lung small cell, squamous, and adenocar-
cinoma not otherwise speciﬁed).; Ovarian Cancer: See comments for all cancers shown
for lung cancer.; Other Cancer(s): See comments for all cancers shown for lung cancer.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias Low The authors reported only statistically signiﬁcant ﬁndings for most analyses. Conse-
quently, SES-stratiﬁed SIRs, regression/correlation coefﬁcients, and p-values are se-
lectively available. In addition, most results were presented only for white men and
women, but the authors stated that results for the total population were almost identical
as the population was predominantly white.

Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium Selected SIRs were cross-classiﬁed by asbestos exposure categories and median in-
come or education. However, distributions of these variables across super tracts were not
shown, nor was the extent to which they related to exposure described. Along with un-
adjusted correlations, multivariate regression models were used to examine how asbestos
in water was associated with SIRs. These models adjusted for super tract medians for
family income, education, percentage married, and proportion employed in industries
with potential asbestos exposure. However, the authors were unable to adjust for the
distribution of other known cancer risk factors (e.g., smoking, alcohol, physical activity,
diet quality) which may vary by census tract.

Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium It is uncertain to what extent adjusting for a variable deﬁned using the estimated per-
centage of construction, electrical and textile workers in each super tract addressed any
confounding by occupational exposure to asbestos. It is also uncertain to what extent
any confounding by individual level SES is addressed using area level SES measures.
SES may affect mobility and thus duration of exposure to water measured at current
residence; the authors attempted to address this using a sensitivity analysis that limited
the sample to persons remaining in the same census tract for 5y. However, 5 years is
relatively short.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low Co-exposures to other pollutants, for example disinfectant by-products or other sub-
stances in the water supply (potential correlates of water quality), was not addressed.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The primary analyses, which compared how SIRs varied across super tract groups with
differing levels of drinking water asbestos, were appropriate to evaluate the study aims.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The population included more than 3,000,000 individuals, and the study accrued more
than 50,000 cases. However, no case numbers or conﬁdence intervals were provided,
making power for analyses involving rare cancers uncertain. Most super tracts would
likely have had zero observed and expected cases for such outcomes.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium Analyses are for the most part described adequately, but key details were at times lack-
ing. For example, the authors present correlation coefﬁcients between "asbestos val-
ues and cancer rates by site and sex for the white population". It is uncertain whether
outcome variables are in fact incidence rates (vs standardized incidence ratios), and
whether/how the rates used were adjusted. Additionally, the authors did not clearly spec-
ify whether the drinking water asbestos variable was categorized or used continuously
(despite its highly non-normal distribution) in either correlations or regression models.
Moreover, along with no case counts, the authors showed very few SIRs, which would
make it difﬁcult to ascertain the extent to which results were replicated.

Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Low The authors described appropriate methods to calculate SIRs, accounting for age, race,
and sex distributions. However, in addition to no case counts, the authors did not provide
conﬁdence intervals for the few SIR values shown. Particularly for very rare cancers,
understanding the level of precision for these estimates is important. Another impor-
tant concern is the use of Pearson"s product moment correlations vs. a non-parametric
method to characterize relationships with the non-normally distributed water asbestos
variable (whether used continuously without transformation or categorized " which
is unclear). Finally, the authors did not adequately describe the log-linear regression
models they used to evaluate associations after accounting for confounding. Log-linear
models are typically used for count/ordinal outcomes, and SIRs were continuous; par-
ticularly without specifying the link function it is unclear that regression models were
used appropriately.The measurement exposure (M4) and/or exposure levels (M5) met-
rics are rated as medium upon review by both set of reviewers. Also, the overall quality
determination (OQD) is rated medium. Extraction will be completed and quality control
reviewed.
Additional Comments: This ecologic study evaluated how standardized incidence ratios for cancers diagnosed in 1969-1974 varied across metropolitan San Francisco communi-
ties with differing levels of chrysotile asbestos " an issue due to natural occurrence - in residential drinking water. To address the limitations of ecological
study designs, the authors incorporated adjustments and sensitivity analyses to address potential biases such as confounding due to area-level SES differ-
ences. A comprehensive cancer incidence registry that included census tract information was used, along with more than 350 water samples to characterize
concentrations of asbestos in the drinking water of 410 census "super tracts". A minor concern is that exposure may have been overestimated by using
the detection limit, rather than half of the detection limit, to impute values below quantiﬁcation. The authors found that areas with higher drinking water
asbestos consistently had higher standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for digestive cancers in both men and women, but ﬁndings for some cancers were
inconsistent. For example, Pearson"s correlations with respiratory cancers (trachea, bronchus, lung) were signiﬁcant only in men, while regression coefﬁ-
cients with these same cancers were signiﬁcant only in women. Exposure was positively associated with pleural cancer in women using regression models
but not correlations; negative associations between exposure and female reproductive cancers were signiﬁcant only using correlations. Methodological
issues such as using unadjusted Pearson correlations despite highly non-normal exposure data contributed to these inconsistencies. Neither case counts nor
conﬁdence intervals were provided for rare outcomes such as pleural cancers, making it difﬁcult to fully interpret those results.The measurement exposure
(M4) and/or exposure levels (M5) metrics are rated as medium upon review by both set of reviewers. Also, the overall quality determination (OQD) is
rated medium. Extraction has been completed and quality control reviewed.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Low This Swedish cross-sectional study included currently employed 99 auto mechanics ex-
posed to low levels of asbestos and 89 unexposed local controls. Only 101 of 259 (39%
) exposed subjects (from the "Motor Health organization" register, selection process not
described) were "approved to participate". Inclusion criteria were age 40y, and >15y
occupational asbestos exposure starting at least 20y prior. Selectivity is a concern given
the absence of details on why they were excluded (primarily unspeciﬁed "lung irritant"
exposure), and how excluded candidates differed from those excluded. Importantly,
excluding individuals with exposures common in mechanic workshops (ex. welding,
paint, or varnish fumes) could yield a sample unrepresentative of the target population"s
exposure-outcome distribution. Indeed, the authors noted in the discussion that healthy
worker selectivity was a concern since "subjects who left their jobs as a consequence of
lung disease were not included in the study".
Metric 2: Attrition Medium There was a moderate loss of subjects. Two of the 101 exposed and 6 of the 89 un-
exposed individuals were excluded from the initial study sample (unspeciﬁed health
disorders).
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium The unexposed comparison group comprised of bus drivers and white-collar workers
drawn from Motor Health and Stockholm trafﬁc registers (no further details, Ns for
each job not provided). Only 89 of 315 candidates (28% ) were approved to partici-
pate (reasons not speciﬁed beyond stating many had past occupational exposure to lung
irritants); the lack of details and comparisons with those included raises selectivity con-
cerns. Comparability of this group with the exposed mechanics may also be suboptimal
because: (i) current employment status is uncertain as participants were selected based
on their "last job description"; (ii) age and duration of employment restrictions used for
the exposed were not applied here. Other differences vs the exposed group which were
not addressed include higher body weight despite similar height (BMI not calculated),
and possible SES disparities.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Exposure was estimated for 95 of the 99 exposed mechanics, who had worked in 386
places, using: ﬁber exposure measurement and analysis, reviews of earlier reports, ques-
tionnaires, and interviews. For ﬁber measures, no details were provided on: collection
equipment; placement, duration or timing of sampling; data availability for past work-
places; or assumptions used in estimation (any published details in Swedish). Fiber
counts were described as using phase contrast light microscope (PCM). Measurement
error is a concern given the authors" report that asbestos dust from brakes – a major
source of exposure – comprise very short ﬁbers ( <0.4mm) not visible under these mi-
croscopes. They stated that concentrations were higher when analyzed using a STEM
(scanning transmission electron microscope) microscope but did not state whether or
how these STEM measures were used.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range of exposure was low by design: work environments below the Swedish con-
centration limit of 0.2 ﬁbers/ml. The median ﬁber concentration over the years evaluated
was 0.08 (IQE 0.06-0.11) ﬁbers/ml, and the median cumulative ﬁber dose 2.3 (IQR 1.5-
3.6) ﬁber-years/ml (8-hour time weighted average). Exposure variables were analyzed
continuously.
Metric 6: Temporality Medium Estimates accounting for past exposure were constructed (details not provided). Eligi-
bility criteria for the exposed included a history of 15 years working in similar envi-
ronments. Temporality is not a concern. However, as this study is cross-sectional, ﬁber
measures obtained by the investigators to help derive exposure estimates would have
been contemporaneous.
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationHigh Pulmonary Function/Spirometry Results: Dynamic and static spirometry, along with a
carbon monoxide single breath wash-out and a nitrogen breath washout, were used to
assess lung function. Measures derived included FVC, FEV1, FEV% , MEF25, closing
volume percent (CV% ) from the nitrogen washout, and transfer factor (TL-co) from the
carbon monoxide washout. The authors cited references for the measures they derived
and reported weekly calibration of equipment. Smokers were asked to refrain from
smoking for 4 hours prior to testing. The authors did not, however, mention blinding
testers to exposure group status.

Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium Results (coefﬁcients and SEs) from models analyzing how exposure status and other
predictors related to all lung function measure were presented (Table III), though co-
efﬁcients were not shown when non-signiﬁcant. However, partial correlations relating
increasing exposure to each lung function measure were presented only for the subgroup
of mechanics also exposed to diesel exhaust (Table IV). The association between lung
function and increasing exposure among all mechanics was shown only for CV% (Fig
1); the lack of a dose-response relationship with TLco was mentioned in the discussion.
p-values, but not conﬁdence intervals, were provided.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium Models adjusted for age, height, never/ever smoking and pack-years for current smok-
ers (not race or sex as participants were white males). Models did not adjust for body
weight or BMI, or for socioeconomic factors.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium Questionnaires and detailed interviews were used to obtain information from partici-
pants, including potential co-exposures. Details on the structure and content of inter-
views and interviewer qualiﬁcations were not provided. Biomarkers were not used.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Medium Diesel exhaust was included as a covariate in partial correlations associating asbestos
exposure to lung function measures in a subgroup of workers. Exposure to "lung irri-
tant" co-exposures was an exclusion criterion.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The authors appropriately used multivariable linear regression and partial correlations to
analyze associations between asbestos exposure variables and lung function outcomes.
Minimally or unadjusted associations were not shown. The paper reported using "ap-
propriate transformations" if variables diverged from normality. ln-transformed asbestos
exposure and diesel exhaust were noted in the results text. Testing of interactions be-
tween asbestos and smoking is mentioned in the discussion.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The modest sample size (n=182), given the low range of exposure under study, might
have undermined sensitivity. The analysis incorporating diesel exhaust, which was lim-
ited to auto mechanics with this exposure, was especially small (n=50). However, the
use of continuous lung function outcome measures increased power.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium Though few details were provided in the description of analyses, information presented
in the tables facilitates reproducing results (variable coding is given, Ns and R-squared
values are provided). However, the main results table presents coefﬁcients only for
variables with p <0.05 but does not state whether non-signiﬁcant variables were included
in the models.

Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Low The authors report appropriate models, correlations, and variable transformations. How-
ever, the analyses did not incorporate any methods aiming to reduce potential risk of
"healthy worker effect" bias, which can be induced by "the selection of unhealthy people
out of the workforce" (PMID: 17053019). The exposed population was restricted to per-
sons sufﬁciently healthy to remain actively employed as mechanics after >15y, without
comparable criteria for the unexposed group. Criteria such as the use of prevalent (but
not past or incident) employees is a well-known risk for healthy worker effect. Strategies
such as adjusting for employment status and duration could have helped to reduce risk of
bias by comparing lung function among subgroups with comparably shorter- or longer-
term employment durations – this was not done. Of note, "epidemiological studies of...
non-fatal outcomes" are especially prone to bias through aspects of the healthy worker
effect. The tendencies for sick workers to leave employment or transfer to less-exposed
jobs are two very commonly observed phenomena in occupational morbidity studies"
(PMID: 17053019).
Additional Comments: This study analyzed lung function among 99 auto mechanics exposed to low levels of asbestos (cumulative exposure 2.3 ﬁber-years/mL) vs. 89 unexposed
white-collar workers and bus drivers with normal lung function. Though asbestos exposure was not associated with several outcomes including FEV1,
exposure was associated with lower transfer factor (TLco from a CO washout) and with airway closure (CV% from a N washout), measures described
as perhaps more sensitive to early lung function decline. There are, however, several concerns. First, 61% of exposed and 72% of unexposed candidate
participants were excluded with few explanatory details. Exclusion of individuals with exposures very common in mechanic workshops (ex. welding or
paint fumes) could yield an unrepresentative sample with limited generalizability. Second, limiting the exposed sample to mechanics actively employed
for>15y, without comparable requirements that unexposed had similarly lengthy active employment, may have induced a healthy worker bias. Analyses
did not adjust for potential confounding by employment status or duration, BMI, or SES. Finally, exposure may have been estimated with error as the thin
ﬁbers found in asbestos dust from automobile brakes are not captured by PCM. These issues may have affected validity of ﬁndings, potentially attenuating
any association between exposure and lung function.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Key elements of study design were reported. Participation is not likely biased and
exposure-outcome distribution of participants is likely representative of those eligi-
ble for inclusion. However, the total number of patients, from which cases with post-
mortem evaluations were chosen, with malignant mesothelioma but with no postmortem
analyses records was not provided. Authors did acknowledged the potential non-
representativeness of this population due to the patient-referred nature of cases which
included wartime dockyard and gas mask workers known to have suffered from heavy
asbestos exposure. All available pathological, occupational and lung ﬁber mineralogical
data on n=177 female malignant mesothelioma cases from unspeciﬁed ﬁle records and
unspeciﬁed geographic residential origin 1963-1990 were reviewed and compared with
n=31 female controls from Exeter, Liverpool, Befast, Dublin, and Cardiff with post-
mortem examinations and no known history of exposure to dusts and no mesothelioma
or lung cancer. Source of data for controls not detailed but assumed to have been from
the same ﬁles as cases.
Metric 2: Attrition Medium Missing information was noted for several subsets of outcome and exposure, and authors
acknowledged the lack of completeness of exposure data, however it was unclear if
this was related to exposure and/or outcome. The total number of participants with
tumor tissue slides available (n=151) was a subset of the total number of mesothelioma
cases (n=177). Tumor tissue slides were available for n=151 of a total of n=177 cases.
Two cases of the total cases tested (n=103 of the n=151 with histologic slides available)
were positive for carcinoembryonic antigen and were excluded from further analyses.
Lung tissue ﬁber burden was examined by transmission electron microscopy for n=105
tumors of known sites (Table 2). Exposure classiﬁcation according to Zielhuis et al.,
1978 (HERO ID 6910362) data was available for n= 93 cases.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Low Inclusion criteria and methods of participant selection for cases and controls was re-
ported. Geographic residential origin of controls, but not cases (other than one case
from Antolia) was reported. Other than restriction of cases and controls to women and
reporting the mean (range) age of n=102 malignant mesothelioma cases (60.5 years (18-
89)) and n=31 controls (68.0 years (30-93)) for which age data was available, details
regarding other potentially relevant demographic and occupational covariate differences
between cases and controls were not considered. Statistical analyses of potential demo-
graphic or other relevant covariate differences between cases and controls was lacking,
and multivariate statistical control for differences, particularly age, between groups was
not detailed. It is unclear to what extent, if any, the healthy worker effect was involved
within results including those cases classiﬁed within Table 4 as having direct occupa-
tional exposure in comparison with the population controls.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Methods used to quantify exposure were well deﬁned, with sources of methods reported.
Lung tissue ﬁber (106 ﬁbers/g), ﬁber length and diameter analyses were assessed by
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) with energy dispersive x ray analysis us-
ing an "EDAX" machine according to the methods within Pooley et al., 1979 (HERO
ID: 3084350). Asbestos exposure classiﬁcation methods for cases only were conducted
as in Zielhuis et al., HERO ID 6910362. Exposure to asbestos was classiﬁed for n=93
(of total n=177 cases) malignant mesothelioma cases according to Zielhuis18 into cat-
egories of (la) direct occupational exposure; (lb) indirect occupational exposure-for
example, workers in the vicinity of asbestos contaminated work situations; (2) paraoccu-
pational exposure-for example, the wives of men working with asbestos; (3) neighbor-
hood exposure-for example, people living in the vicinity of asbestos mines or processing
factories; (4) exposure in ambient air; and (5) no known exposure. Only n=74 (80% of
the total n=93 cases with Zielhuis classiﬁed exposure history data of the total n=177 ma-
lignant mesothelioma cases) cases had a history of known exposure to asbestos. Zielhuis
classiﬁcation of potential historical exposure for controls was not detailed.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range and distribution of exposure is sufﬁcient to develop and exposure-response
estimate. Table 3 reports lung ﬁber burden (x 10^ 6 ﬁbers/g lung) across ﬁve ﬁbrosis
grade categories for n=116 mesothelioma cases.
Metric 6: Temporality Low The temporality of exposure and outcome is uncertain. This study reported cross-
sectional analyses of the relationship between postmortem ﬁbrosis and lung ﬁber bur-
dens in mesothelioma cases and controls for which temporality cannot be established.
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationMedium Other Non-Cancer Outcomes: Fibrosis was assessed and graded for n=152 mesothe-
lioma cases and n=31 controls according to Hinson et al., 1973 (HERO ID 3101627).
Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium There were no concerns for selective reporting. No formal statistical analyses between
cases and controls was conducted, and no effect estimates were reported however lung
ﬁber concentration burdens as geometric means (range) were reported across categories
of ﬁbrosis grade in Table 3.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Low Analyses were restricted to female cases and controls. Additional statistical control for
potentially relevant demographic or other variables was not conducted.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Low Source of covariate data (age only) was not directly stated, nor validated, but assumed to
have been obtained from the ﬁles from which patient data were obtained.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low This metric is rated low because Klerk et al. 1989 783917, Reid et al. 2006 3079799,
and Reid et al. 2004 3080174 relied on historic dust measures (konimeters, thermal
precipitators) without documenting the use of appropriate conversions. These papers
cited the single time point membrane ﬁlter PCM ﬁber concentration measures that were
taken in 1966, shortly before the facility closed (publication not available in HERO or
other online sources, Major 1968 entitled the First Australian Pneumoconiosis Confer-
ence). However, they did not mention or cite a dust-to-ﬁber conversion factor, and no
such factors were identiﬁed in the literature. Concerns regarding the validity and utility
of occupational exposure measures used in Wittenoom studies have been expressed by
the industrial hygienist responsible for the membrane ﬁlter measures (e.g., Rogers and
Major 2002 HEROID 3080506).
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The distribution of exposure provided in de Klerk et al 783917 appears to be sufﬁcient
to develop an exposure-response estimate. Cumulative exposure was used in analyses
either as a continuous variable or in 4 categories. As noted above, however, there are
important concerns remain regarding the validity of exposure estimates.
Additional Comments: Klerk et al. 1989 783917, Reid et al. 2006 3079799, and Reid et al. 2004 3080174 were not evaluated for any metrics except Metric 4 and 5 and had no
data extracted because they did not have sufﬁcient exposure information to be useful for dose-response analysis.
??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low The authors did not use PCM or TEM to quantify ﬁbers. "A survey of airborne res-
pirable ﬁbres of crocidolite greater than 5um in length was carried out at various work
sites at Wittenoom in 1966. These measurements were used to obtain estimates of ﬁ-
bre concentrations for all 87 job categories in the various worksites." This survey was
supplemented by subjective ranking of the degree of dustiness "provided by an ex-
superintendent of operations at Wittenoom, and veriﬁed by the industrial hygienist who
conducted the 1966 survey."
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low Mean cumulative exposure (f/ml-years) was 71 for cases, and 23 for controls for as-
bestosis (Table 4), reporting only 2 levels of exposure. Subjects could be controls for
more than one case and some cases could be control for other earlier cases (e.g., controls
may have been exposed and/or at risk for asbestosis/lung cancer).
Additional Comments: QC was not completed for metrics other than Metrics 4 and 5 because the study does not have sufﬁcient exposure information to be useful for dose-
response analysis.Asbestosis was not assessed for all subjects thoroughly (only through death certiﬁcates or through reported workers compensation
claims). Wittenoom cohort the diagnosis of asbestosis for compensation purposes the of death is or as cause closely related to the degree of crocidolite to
exposure but not to smoking habits. Although study mentions 2400 men were included in the cohort, it appears that the cases and controls considered for
asbestosis were pulled from a larger cohort (N=2713).

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Authors do not describe how exposure was measured. Instead, measurements from a
different study were referenced for this paper (Armstrong, et al., 1988). The introduction
states that the median duration of employment (four months) and medium cumulative
exposure (six f/mL-y). They authors do not explain how the research in Armstrong et
al., 1988 measured this exposure.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The provided values from Armstrong, et al., 1988 seem sufﬁcient to the analysis in this
paper. Duration since exposure to crocidolite is distributed by years:0-20 y, 21-25 y,26-
30 y, and >31 y
Additional Comments: Overall, this study did a good job in adjusting for smoking and providing various types of lung cancer following past exposure to crocidolite. The
study has some inconsistencies in how exposure was measured, only referencing a past study. Additionally, women were excluded from this study when
included in the original survey, and authors do not explain why.Overall, information on the measurement of exposure metric (M4) to assess exposure was
limited. However, the exposure levels metric (M5) information reported was adequate to determine exposure-response relationships. The overall quality
determination (OQD) for this study is rated medium.
?No biomarkers were identiﬁed for this evaluation.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium A retrospective cohort design was used for this study. Inclusion in the cohort was lim-
ited to the male employees who had worked in the asbestos plant for 6 months or more,
and at least one month of that must have taken place between January 1, 1940 and De-
cember 31, 1965. It is important to note that the 1965 deadline was used to provide a
latency of 10 years for participants. The authors reported that a total of 768 white males
and 372 black males were included in the ﬁnal cohort, however only white males were
used for the dose-response analysis. Some individuals were excluded for various rea-
sons including: lacking sufﬁcient demographic data (8 individuals), and two individuals
were identiﬁed as war deaths, and were thus removed from the analysis once their em-
ployment was terminated. The eight individuals excluded for a lack of demographic
information were not believed to introduce bias because they "demonstrated no unusual
characteristics such as employment in speciﬁc departments or jobs or a racial composi-
tion different from the remainder of the cohort." A United States Public Health Service
study was conducted at the plant in 1968, and all employee records were microﬁlmed.
These records contained detailed information on demographic data, the employment
history, which was coded based on the job functions performed. This coding scheme
helped with determining ﬁber exposures. While some details are presented pertaining to
participant selection, information about participation rates at the various steps would be
beneﬁcial.
Metric 2: Attrition High Of the 768 white males originally identiﬁed for this cohort. all of them were included
in ﬁnal analyses. Several participants had an unknown vital status as of December 31,
1975 (n=22) - however, for those participants it was assumed that they were still alive to
ensure that they could still be used for analysis.

Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium For the standardized mortality ratio analysis conducted in this study, the expected num-
ber of deaths were determined using "cause-speciﬁc death rates for the total United
States to the person-years at risk of dying." The authors specify that the number of ex-
pected deaths were standardized for sex, age, race, and calendar time. The period of
follow-up for this study incorporated a time period when the Fifth through Eighth Re-
visions of the International Lists of Diseases and Causes of Death were being used.
"Death rates speciﬁc to the 89 Seventh Revision death groups were calculated form
yearly tallies of deaths and census data." U.S. deaths from 1940-1975 were obtained
from the "Vital Statistics of the United States," which was published yearly. The author
mentioned that they considered determining the expected death rates from counties sur-
rounding the county in which the plant was located. However, this was rejected because
a shipyard industry was present, which has been associated with potential asbestos ex-
posure. This was compounded by the potential increase in lung cancer and other health
outcomes resulting from asbestos plant workers, especially from the time when records
were not as well-maintained. It was also mentioned that the smoking rates among white
cohort members was nearly identical to the U.S. population. There is some potential
concern for healthy worker bias due to the comparison of an occupational population to
the general population, but this is not expected to have a substantial impact on the results
of the study.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure High Due to the number of years that this plant was operational, there was a plethora of expo-
sure data available from a number of sources, including the company’s insurance carrier,
the State Board of Health, the U.S. Public Health Service, and a sampling program that
was run by the company itself. It is noted that "prior to 1965 all samples were of the im-
pinger type; from 1965 until 1971 membrane ﬁlter samples were also taken. In 1971, the
impinger method was abandoned and the membrane ﬁlter method used exclusively." Im-
pinger samples were reported to be collected at the worker’s "breathing level" and "oper-
ators were followed when there was considerable movement." Membrane ﬁlter samples
were collected via battery operated pumps worn by the workers being sampled. When
the midget impinger methods were utilized, a bright ﬁeld optical microscope was used
to count the asbestos particles, at a magniﬁcation of 100x. All concentrations calculated
using this method were reported in millions of particles per cubic foot of air (MPPCF).
When using the membrane ﬁlter method, phase contrast optical microscopy was used, at
a magniﬁcation of 400-450x. Paired sample analysis was used to compare the impinger
data to the membrane ﬁlter data, resulting in a conversion ratio of 3.0 generally and 8.0
for all activities related to ﬁber preparation, for ﬁnal measurements presented in ﬁbers/
cc. Cumulative ﬁber exposure for individual workers was calculated by using detailed
work histories and location-speciﬁc and job-speciﬁc estimates of ﬁber exposure.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The authors report 4 levels of exposure in their SMR analysis to evaluate dose-response
relationships. Estimates of exposure are reported in ﬁber/cc days. The lowest com-
parator group represents exposures less than <10,000 ﬁber/cc days, while the highest
comparator group represents exposures between 100,000-200,000 ﬁber/cc days.
Metric 6: Temporality Medium The author mentions that the cutoff for follow-up, in 1965, was selected to allow for a
minimum latency of 10 years. The metric was rated as medium because of this indica-
tion from the author, although there were some individuals enrolled who had a longer
latency period, including intervals of 10-19, 20-29, and greater than or equal to 30.
However, summary statistics regarding latency are not provided, preventing a determina-
tion of the average latency for the cohort.

ofﬁces. Also, "the entire death index (1935-1979) for the state in which the plant was
located was searched in an attempt to locate certiﬁcates missed by searches conducted
by state personnel." The follow-up period for this study incorporated a few different
versions of the International Lists of Diseases and Causes of Death, including the Fifth
through Eighth Revisions. A nosologist coded all of the death certiﬁcates according to
the ICDA revision that was being used at the time of the participants death. and were

Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium SMRs are reported with both observed numbers of deaths and expected numbers of
deaths, along with indicators of statistical signiﬁcance. Some outcomes are used in
an analysis of binary exposure (exposed vs. unexposed) but are then not used in dose-
response analysis. It is not explained why they were not analyzed for dose-response
data. SMRs for lung cancer and other nonmalignant respiratory diseases were also plot-
ted via least squares based on the Poisson distribution, and 95% conﬁdence intervals
are presented, although the exact effect estimates from that analysis are only presented
graphically with no reporting of regression coefﬁcients.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium Age, race, sex, and calendar time period were adjusted for via the calculation of stan-
dardized mortality rates based on those criteria.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium The author did not discuss the tools used to assess potential confounders among study
participants. However, because this was an occupational study, it can be assumed that
personnel records were used to obtain covariate data. Comparison population covari-
ates (via standardized mortality rates) were pulled from "Vital Statistics of the United
States."
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Medium The author details in Chapter 2 that over the years of operation, various expansions
took place to allow for the production of rubber goods. It is important to note that many
of the asbestos textile productions took place in speciﬁc buildings. While this might
have presented a situation in which individuals were exposed to asbestos and various
materials involved in the creation of rubber products, this does not appear to be the
case. It was reported that "a departmental seniority system limited employee transfer
between rubber and textile departments." The separation of production facilities on the
plant grounds seems to be useful in limited potential exposures to substances other than
asbestos.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The retrospective cohort design implemented by the author was appropriate for the
research question being examined. The calculation of SMRs is an appropriate method
for assessing the potential association between asbestos exposure and general or cause-
speciﬁc mortality.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium While there was no explicit discussion of the power for their calculations, the number of
participants analyzed (n=768) is adequate to detect an effect in the exposed population.

Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The authors clearly describe their methods; thus, it would be possible to recreate their
ﬁndings if given access to the analytic data.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium The method the authors report for the calculation of SMRs is transparent and well-
documented. There are less details provided for their use of a Poisson distribution and
they do not describe model assumptions, but it is reasonable to assume that model as-
sumptions were met.
Additional Comments: It is important to note that this study is a dissertation. The author provides extensive detail pertaining to the history of the plant, along with information
about engineering controls and how exposure data was collected over the years. Section 5 and 6 are the most relevant, discussing the mortality study
and dose-response analysis, respectively. There were some limitations noted for this study, including the information pertaining to participant selection.
Information about participation rates and a total number of employees would have been beneﬁcial. This study also had some strengths, including the
author’s discussion about limiting potential co-exposures from the rubber production at the plant, as well as their explanation about using broader U.S.
death rates as a comparison for SMR analysis because of characteristics of the surrounding counties. The separate mortality and dose-response analyses
were a beneﬁt of this study, as the author is able to report results for various relationships between asbestos exposure and health outcomes.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection High The cohort comprised 1,261 white males employed 1 month at a chrysotile asbestos
textile factory in South Carolina between 1940 an 1965, with vital status ascertained
through December 1975. Personnel records were maintained starting in 1930 " 10 years
prior to this study " with similar information collected since that time. Selection bias
should be limited since the study included a diverse sample of workers with both long
and very short employment duration and varying dates of initial employment.
Metric 2: Attrition High The cohort included all records that met eligibility criteria. Vital status was ascertained
for all but 26 (2.1% ) members of the cohort.
Metric 3: Comparison Group High SMRs were calculated using the total US white male population to deﬁne the number
of expected overall and cause-speciﬁc deaths. "The number of expected deaths, stan-
dardized for sex, age, race and calendar time, were calculated by application of cause-
speciﬁc death rates for the total United States to the person-years at risk of dying. Death
rates speciﬁc to the 89... death groups were calculated from yearly tallies of deaths and
census data." The US population referent was used because of very high mortality rates
in the county where the plant was located (75% higher than US white males), making
the general population a more suitable referent. The high rate may be due in part to a
large shipyard industry in the county (potential source of asbestos exposure). Mortality
was also elevated in neighboring counties.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Cumulative exposure estimates used detailed work histories and air sampling data; time
exposed in each job and ﬁber conversions may be over-estimates as detailed below. In-
dividual exposure was obtained by summing the product of average concentrations for
each job at that time by the duration spent in that job. Time worked in each job/exposure
zone was estimated in days based on the difference in dates of job changes. This method
did not eliminate weekends and holidays, and did not account for overtime, both of
which introduced some measurement error. Estimated ﬁber concentrations, expressed
as ﬁbers >5mm per cubic center (i.e., milliliter), were derived using a total of 5,952
dust samples collected between 1930 and 1975 by the company, insurance carrier, state
health board and US public health service. Samples were collected by impinger prior
to 1965, by impinger and membrane ﬁlter from 1965-1971, and from 1971 onward by
membrane ﬁlter. Pre-1930 exposures were assigned the values measured prior to imple-
mentation of controls. Conversion of dust measures to estimated ﬁber concentrations
using concurrent impinger - membrane ﬁlter samples (120 in 1965 from the US Pub-
lic Health service, 968 from plant operations in 1968-71). No signiﬁcant differences in
conversions were detected by calendar time or plant operation: mean conversions were
7.8 ﬁbers/cc per MPPCF for ﬁber preparation, and 2.5 ﬁbers per MPPCF for other oper-
ations. However, this study used conversion factors of 8 for ﬁber preparation and 3 for
other operations, described as "conservatively high conversion values".
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Several analyses (overall and cause-speciﬁc SMRs, incidence density for respiratory
outcomes) used 5 categories of cumulative exposure in ﬁbers/cc-days ( <1,000; 1,000-
10,000; 10,000-40,000; 40,000-100,000; and >100,000). In addition, some analyses
were stratiﬁed by exposure characterized using 4 categories of either years since initial
employment ( <10, 10-19, 20-29, 30 years) or total years employed (same categories).
Metric 6: Temporality High The maximum follow up was >35 years (1940 to 1975, some employed prior to 1940),
and the minimum 10 years (1965-1975). With a total of 33,141 person years at risk
among 1,261 members, the mean follow-up was likely about 26 years. Additionally,
analyses of dose-response rates for respiratory outcomes were limited to men with 15 or
more years latency.

Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationMedium Asbestosis: Death certiﬁcates were coded by a qualiﬁed nosologist, using ICD 7 codes
510-527 (523 and 527 are pneumoconioses) to identify non-infectious non-malignant
respiratory disease, which included asbestosis/pulmonary ﬁbrosis (combined) as un-
derlying causes of disease (including among cardiovascular deaths). Overall, asbestosis
or pulmonary ﬁbrosis were speciﬁed as the cause in 17 of 24 cases of non-infectious,
non-malignant respiratory disease. All of these cases had 15 or more years of latency
since ﬁrst exposure. It was not feasible in this study design to obtain other information
(e.g., medical records) to conﬁrm diagnoses reported on death certiﬁcates. Combining
asbestosis and pulmonary ﬁbrosis limits speciﬁcity. However, asbestosis may have been
under-diagnosed/classiﬁed as pulmonary ﬁbrosis.; Other Non-Cancer Outcomes: The
outcomes evaluated included all-cause mortality, mortality from other (non-infectious)
non-malignant respiratory disease (ONMRD), and circulatory system mortality, and
lung cancer mortality. The 24 deaths from other non-malignant respiratory disease (ON-
MRD) included asbestosis. Asbestosis or pulmonary ﬁbrosis were underlying causes of
17 of these deaths (6 identiﬁed by examining contributory causes for the 105 individ-
uals with cardiovascular mortality). Vital status through 1975 was ascertained for all
but 26 (2.1% ) of the 1,261 cohort members. Multiple sources were used, including the
Social Security Administration (SSA), IRS, USPS, drivers" license records, and state
vital statistics ofﬁces, along with telephone listings, property, and voter records, among
others. Of 308 deaths, all but 17 death certiﬁcates were obtained. Death certiﬁcates
(which spanned ICD versions 5 to 8) were coded in 89 categories by a nosologist and
standardized using ICD 7 codes. Cause unknown was assigned for the 17 known deaths
for which no certiﬁcate was available.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium Numbers of expected and observed deaths were presented for all SMR analyses. How-
ever, SMRs did not include conﬁdence intervals. Conﬁdence intervals and the person-
years at risk denominator were reported for the incidence density of respiratory out-
comes, which was reported by cumulative exposure category. The authors did not report
the methods used for statistical signiﬁcance testing.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium SMRs accounted for age, sex, race, and calendar period. Smoking data was only avail-
able for cohort members who completed a respiratory symptom questionnaire in 1964
and 1971 as part of a public health service study. However, the authors illustrated that
available estimates for current, past, and non-smoking for the cohort were extremely
similar to those for US white males in 1965. Incidence density analyses did not report
covariate adjustments. However, the study was limited to white males and incidence
density accounts for person-time.

Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium Data came primarily from personnel records and death certiﬁcates.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Medium Co-exposures (e.g., from earlier or subsequent work) were not taken into account. Silica
or other occupational exposures may have contributed to risk of deaths coded pulmonary
ﬁbroses. However, there is no direct evidence that co-exposures might have confounded
the ﬁndings.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium Methods were appropriate. SMRs were calculated using a life-table method (reference is
cited) and Poisson regression was used to estimate incidence density.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium There were 308 deaths overall, including 24 from other non-malignant respiratory dis-
eases (22 with 15+ years latency). Of the 22, 17 deaths had codes for asbestosis and
pulmonary ﬁbrosis as primary or underlying causes of death. Sparse numbers are not
unusual for outcomes such as asbestosis.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The analyses presented should be readily reproducible as analyses were described and
cell sizes presented in adequate detail.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium The authors explained their rationale and methods in sufﬁcient detail and methods were
appropriate. For SMRs, few confounders besides smoking are typically considered.
Additional Comments: This study analyzed mortality in a cohort of 1,261 white males employed 1 month at a chrysotile asbestos textile factory in South Carolina between 1940
and 1965, followed through 1975. Vital status (98% ) and cause of death (94% ) ascertainment were nearly complete. Use of a dynamic cohort of individuals
employed at any time during a 25-year period reduced the likelihood of healthy worker survivor bias. Exposure was estimated using historical air samples,
applying dust-to-ﬁber conversion estimates for early years; methods may have over-estimated exposure. Based on person-years among participants with
>15 years of follow-up and converting cumulative exposure-days to years ("365), about 61% of the cohort had exposures >27.4 ﬁber/mL-years [10,000
ﬁber/cc-days]; 7% had exposures >109.6 ﬁber/mL-years [40,000 ﬁber/cc-years]. SMRs for non-malignant respiratory disease (excluding infectious)
increased from 362 to 2500 over 5 categories of increasing cumulative exposure. Incidence density for asbestos or pulmonary ﬁbrosis mortality also
increased from 0.32/1000 person years to 15.98/1000 person-years with increasing exposure. SMRs were also stratiﬁed by years employed and years since
initial employment categories. SMRs for lung cancer increased from 140 to 1818 over 5 categories of increasing cumulative exposure. Limitations include
that asbestosis and pulmonary ﬁbrosis were combined; it is not possible to ascertain if some cases might be ﬁbroses attributable to other occupational
exposures. Although smoking adjustments were not possible, limited data suggested that smoking history in the cohort closely resembled the US white
male population.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection High The cohort comprised 1,261 white males employed 1 month at a chrysotile asbestos
textile factory in South Carolina between 1940 an 1965, with vital status ascertained
through December 1975. Personnel records were maintained starting in 1930 " 10 years
prior to this study " with similar information collected since that time. Selection bias
should be limited since the study included a diverse sample of workers with both long
and very short employment duration and varying dates of initial employment.
Metric 2: Attrition High The cohort included all records that met eligibility criteria. Vital status was ascertained
for all but 26 (2.1% ) members of the cohort.
Metric 3: Comparison Group High SMRs were calculated using the total US white male population to deﬁne the number
of expected overall and cause-speciﬁc deaths. "The number of expected deaths, stan-
dardized for sex, age, race and calendar time, were calculated by application of cause-
speciﬁc death rates for the total United States to the person-years at risk of dying. Death
rates speciﬁc to the 89... death groups were calculated from yearly tallies of deaths and
census data." The US population referent was used because of very high mortality rates
in the county where the plant was located (75% higher than US white males), making
the general population a more suitable referent. The high rate may be due in part to a
large shipyard industry in the county (potential source of asbestos exposure). Mortality
was also elevated in neighboring counties.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium This ﬁxed cohort comprised 586 male workers at an asbestos plant in Chongqing, China
employed in 1972 and followed through December 2006. The plant used chrysotile
asbestos to manufacture textiles, rubber plate and cement. This ﬁxed cohort excluded
workers not employed for 1 year at baseline and did not include either former workers
or new workers employed after 1972. These exclusions might induce the risk of healthy
worker survivor bias, shifting associations toward the null (e.g., Arrighi & Picciotto,
1996, HEROID 79805). Mean (SD) length of employment in the cohort was 25.4 (8.3)
years. Very long-term workers with low attrition likely over-represent those individuals
least vulnerable to adverse effects and to have accumulated high exposure. In contrast,
employees who may have self-selected out of employment after a shorter duration due
to poor health/symptoms are likely to be both under-represented in the cohort, and to
contribute person-time primarily to low exposure.
Metric 2: Attrition High Overall, only 49 workers " 7.7% of the 635 men employed at the factory in 1972 " were
excluded at baseline because they had worked for less than 1 year (shorter-term employ-
ees). In addition, 73 workers in the cohort were lost to follow-up, but job histories and
vital records were available from records.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium Analyses used workers in the same cohort with lower exposure as the comparison group.
This approach reduces healthy worker hire bias but may not address healthy worker sur-
vivor bias related to attrition. Because the cohort was ﬁxed, lower exposure is primarily
a consequence of a relatively shorter employment duration: the comparison group may
over-represent individuals who stopped work due to poor health. To address this issue,
the authors incorporated exposure lag times, a method recommended to account for dis-
ease latency and help reduce healthy worker survivor bias by reducing reliance on the
participants with the shortest exposures. However, the effectiveness of applying this
approach cannot be ascertained (e.g., Arrighi & Picciotto, 1996 79805).

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Despite limitations (e.g., infrequent measures with sampling every 4 years), exposure
was estimated based on substantial quantitative data: a total of 556 measures, 223 us-
ing ﬁber counting with PCM. Estimated exposure intensity in this Chinese study was
considerably higher than in numerous studies in Western countries. Air monitoring data
from plant records was used for 1955-1970; the authors did not describe methods, equip-
ment, or frequency for this period. Exposure was measured every four years at the area
level (breathing zones) from 1970 to 2006 using a membrane ﬁlter (missing details e.g.,
on # hours). Paired dust and ﬁber concentrations (n=90) collected in 1999, 2002 and
2006 in each of the 7 factory workshops were used to develop a linear model to con-
vert dust measures to estimated ﬁber concentrations. No details were provided e.g., on
goodness-of-ﬁt, or how measured and estimated ﬁber concentrations were combined for
1970-1994. Work areas were grouped into 4 categories based on work processes and
dust/ﬁber concentrations, with cumulative exposure for individuals estimated by sum-
ming the relevant concentration multiplied by duration. Exposure status in the cohort
was updated annually after baseline.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Cumulative exposure was analyzed using a continuous ﬁber/mL-year variable.
Metric 6: Temporality High The follow-up time of 35 years was adequate for analyses of asbestosis. The authors
stated that none of the workers had a diagnosis of cardiopulmonary disease at baseline
(details not provided on any health examinations). All deaths from asbestosis occurred
10+ years after ﬁrst exposure, the great majority after 15+ years.

tality was high (n=226 deaths). Asbestosis (n=37 cases) was determined by a special
panel based on criteria that included a job history conﬁrming occupational exposure,
positive radiographic ﬁndings, and clinical signs and symptoms, as established by the
1986 Chinese Diagnosis Criteria of Pneumoconiosis by Radiograph. "Death from as-
bestosis was broadened to include asbestosis and any asbestosis complications, such as
cor pulmonale." Ascertainment of vital status involved annual follow-up at the plant and
with families (97% ).
Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium The study presented results that included descriptive data on numbers and causes of
death stratiﬁed by smoking, ﬁber-to-dust conversions, and associations using alternative
model speciﬁcations. However, the authors did not present the distribution of deaths
over time or describe the number of deaths included when different exposure lag times
were applied in their analyses.

Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium Models adjusted for age, calendar time and smoking status. The article stated that the
majority of workers retired during the follow-up period; however, analyses did not
account for employment status changes as recommended (Arrighi & Picciotto, 1996
79805). Changes in employment status related to symptoms might be a confounder.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium Questionnaires, employment records and interviews with employees, family members
and coworkers were used to characterize covariates (e.g., smoking habits, job changes)
for both living and deceased workers.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Medium The study did not evaluate any co-exposures, but co-exposure confounding is unlikely
for asbestosis.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The study compared associations using alternative models based on varying possible
exposure-response relationship. Models adjusted for potential confounders that included
calendar time and smoking, and incorporated exposure lag times in an effort to address
both disease latency and potential healthy worker survivor bias. As noted earlier models
did not adjust for employment status. NOTE: The online supplementary materials that
provided more details on these alternative models were requested but not yet available at
the time of this evaluation.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium There were 226 deaths in the cohort of 568 men, including 37 from asbestosis. Power
to detect interactions (tested with smoking) was likely limited given the small number
of cases and moderate overall sample size. Indeed, one model speciﬁcation failed to
converge for asbestosis.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The analyses presented are likely to be reproducible given the substantial detail provided
on model speciﬁcations. NOTE: Reproducibility of results in online supplementary
materials has not been evaluated as they are not yet available.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium The authors explained the rationale for their statistical methods used and covariates
examined. For example, they described the alternative model forms examined, discussed
interactions tested, and explained the use of exposure lagging.

Additional Comments: This study evaluated the association between chrysotile asbestos exposure and mortality from asbestosis. The population comprised a ﬁxed cohort of 586
workers employed for 1 year at a Chinese asbestos textile factory in 1972, followed to 2006. Neither former workers nor individuals employed after
1972 were not included. High exposure concentrations (attributed to legislation and management delays) and lengthy employment duration resulted in
higher cumulative exposure (126.1 f-y/mL) than in Western studies of chrysotile textile workers (e.g., 17.1 f/mL-year in a North Carolina study, Loomis
et al 2009). However, details on early exposure measurement methods were not provided, and monitoring was infrequent throughout the study. Mortality
(n=226 total) included 37 deaths from asbestosis. The authors evaluated alternative model forms and reported signiﬁcant associations with asbestosis
mortality: the relative risk was 10.4 for 40 years of exposure to 1 f/mL of asbestos. Lung cancer mortality was also analyzed and the association with
cumulative asbestos exposure described as signiﬁcant (additional details in online supplement not yet available). Given the use of a ﬁxed cohort, healthy
worker survivor bias could have shifted associations towards the null. Low exposure may over-represent individuals selected out of employment duration
due in part to poorer health, while the more highly exposed long-term workers may over-represent less vulnerable "survivors". The authors incorporated
exposure lags of up to 10 years to help address this bias (Arrighi & Picciotto, 1996 79805), but effectiveness is uncertain. NOTE: Online supplementary
materials that included parameter estimates of key models not yet available.The measurement exposure (M4) and/or exposure levels (M5) metrics are rated
as medium upon review by both set of reviewers. Also, the overall quality determination (OQD) is rated medium. Extraction has been completed and
quality control reviewed.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium This study used pediatric clinic records to evaluate respiratory morbidity rates among
children exposed to low levels of asbestos in the ambient air. Exposed children lived in
Asbest City in Russia, 2-4 km away from chrysotile asbestos mining and milling facil-
ities. Different records were used to evaluate 3 main questions. (1) Is respiratory mor-
bidity higher in Asbest than a control region? This analysis used n=260 children born in
1981-82 and 1986-87 aged up to 10y. (2) Are short term changes in asbestos-containing
dust linked to acute changes in respiratory morbidity? Analyses used n=500 children
aged 0 to 2y residing in Asbest in 1981-84 and 1986-88. (3) Is long-term average expo-
sure to asbestos-containing dust associates with increases in average respiratory mor-
bidity rates? Analyses used birth cohorts from 1980-91 of "approximately 50 children"
each. There is no evidence of selectivity that could bias the exposure-outcome distribu-
tion in the study. However, possible concerns are of note. (i) Potential data quality issues
were not described (eg representativeness of population covered by available records;
extent of missing and incomplete data; inconsistent or erroneous data; underreporting
of cases not seen in clinics). (ii) Selection criteria excluded children with chronic respi-
ratory diseases (e.g. chronic bronchitis) whose morbidity patterns may differ from the
general population. This may have eliminated the subgroup most susceptible to respira-
tory effects of pollutant exposures (eg Brumberg et al 2021 HERO ID 8348917).
Metric 2: Attrition Medium There is no information on missing data or loss to follow-up, and thus there is no di-
rect evidence to suggest concerns regarding attrition. Data such as birth cohort Ns, not
provided, could have provided indirect evidence of low attrition.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium One analysis used clinic records of n=110 unexposed children as a comparison: children
born in the same years residing in Ekaterinburg, about 85 km from Asbest City with
no large industrial plants and lower average dust concentrations (0.1 mg/m3). Use of
local area controls should be appropriate; however, comparability of SES and duration
of residence in the two areas was not described. Remaining analyses used internal com-
parisons of children living in Asbest City, analyzing changes in respiratory morbidity
rates at lower vs. higher levels of dust pollution. Internal comparisons should also be
appropriate. There is potential for bias should there be selectively higher rates of moving
away from the area among children with higher respiratory morbidity; no evidence of
such bias is available. However, there were no children with bronchial asthma (ICD j45)
in the sample.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium The primary exposure used in analyses was "asbestos-containing dust" – levels of solid
aerosols (particulate matter) with documented asbestos content. Quantities of dust were
estimated based on "continuous monitoring" for particulate matter was done at sites
speciﬁcally selected to provide information on non-occupational exposures". Further
details on equipment, sampling frame (years, seasons, monitoring locations, numbers
of samples), and methods used were not provided. A daily or annual mean concen-
tration for all of Asbest City was used for analysis. Asbestos content of ambient air,
useful for characterizing exposure speciﬁcally to asbestos, was estimated in two ways.
First, asbestos concentrations within solid aerosols were estimated using a "combina-
tion of phase-contrast optical and transmission electron microscopy". Mass measures
included the total asbestos-containing fraction (0.4 mg/m3 or 35% of total dust), the ﬁ-
brous fraction (0.024 mg/m3 or 12% ), and the respirable ﬁber fraction (0.004 mg/m3 or
2% ). Second, atmospheric asbestos ﬁber concentrations were measured in samples from
March to June 1993. PCOM was used to count ﬁbers >5mm in length (no details eg on
equipment, timing of samples). Concentrations ranged from 0.008 to 0.106 ﬁbers/mL of
air on any given day (0.002 to 0.024 ﬁbers/mL in "non-industrial areas") and averaged
0.020 to 0.040 ﬁbers/mL per month. In the absence of important changes in operation
of the facilities or atmospheric conditions, 1993 data may characterize habitual levels to
which the children were recently exposed. Data in Table 3 suggest mean exposure levels
may have decreased over time.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Exposures were quantiﬁed as: (1) residence in Asbest City vs Ekaterinburg; (2) daily
asbestos-containing dust concentrations quantiﬁed in three categories ( <0.025 mg/m3,
0.025-0.5 mg/m3, >0.5 mg/m3); (3) annual average asbestos-containing dust concentra-
tions for each of 11 years (continuous).
Metric 6: Temporality Low Temporal sequencing was clear in the analyses of daily variation in dust concentrations
and acute changes in respiratory morbidity occurring in the subsequent 0 to 4 days. The
other primary analyses were cross-sectional, evaluating associations between concurrent
dust pollution and morbidity rates, also appropriate since reverse causality is implausi-
ble.

Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationMedium Other Non-Cancer Outcomes: The authors used ICD-10 codes for respiratory morbidity
endpoints described as including bronchitis, acute infection, and pneumonia. Analyses
combined these upper (affecting the nose, sinuses, throat) and lower (affecting the air-
ways and lungs) respiratory infections. Morbidity episode counts were used to calculate
the number of cases per 1,000 years of life, and to categorize children by number of
repeat infections per year. Some details on outcome characterization are lacking. The
paper speciﬁes using endpoint codes for bronchitis (j20, j21; a lower respiratory infec-
tion) and for upper respiratory infections (j00 - j06) but does not provide codes used
for pneumonia (eg j18.9) or mention including unspeciﬁed acute lower respiratory in-
fections (j22). The prevalence of any omitted cases cannot be ascertained. The authors
reported excluding morbidity among children diagnosed with chronic rhinitis (j31), si-
nusitis (j32) and bronchitis (j40-42, j44). The impact of such exclusions on morbidity
counts was not reported. These illnesses were described as more prevalent in Asbest
City than the control region (no further information).
Metric 8: Reporting Bias Low The authors frequently presented results only for speciﬁc age groups, predominantly
among one year old children (see Figures 4 and 6, Tables 1 and 2). The selective re-
sults were explained by reporting bias: the authors stated that data for other age groups
did not support hypothesized relationships (eg the association "between dust level and
respiratory disease was revealed only for the children one year of age"; the "rate of inci-
dence of respiratory diseases for children between 0 and I 0 years of age in Asbest City
is much higher than that of the control group only for those one year old or less"). The
authors do not explain why the birth cohort years included vary for different analyses;
table 3 suggests air pollution data were not available for 1985. Finally, the text mentions
other outcomes that have been hypothesized to associate with asbestos (allergies, skin
rash) but do not present ﬁndings for these endpoints.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Low Analyses were stratiﬁed by age. However other potential confounders (eg child sex,
environmental tobacco smoke, SES, exposure to mold or dampness) were not included
in their analyses.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium Age and year of birth information obtained from pediatric clinic records is likely to be
sufﬁciently valid for analysis.

Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low The main co-exposure of concern is particulate matter. Because exposure is measured
as particulate matter (asbestos-containing dust), this study is unable to separate potential
respiratory effects of asbestos from potential effects that have been attributed to partic-
ulate matter (eg see Nhung et al 2017, HEROID 4169645, Horne et al 2018 HEROID
6986632, Ziou et al 2022 PMID 35183515). Other potential co-exposures not consid-
ered include season, temperature, humidity and indoor air pollution (eg Goncalves et al
HEROID 89884, Kumar et a 2007 HEROID 1065829).
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The majority of analyses were descriptive. Data are presented appropriately but sam-
ple size numbers were not shown, and no statistical testing was reported. Morbidity
incidence rates per 1000 life years were calculated to account for variation in sample
size that could affect simple counts, but no description of the data used was provided.
Analyses included age-stratiﬁed data showing the percentage of children with fewer vs
greater numbers of respiratory episodes per years, and age-stratiﬁed morbidity incidence
rates by asbestos dust exposure category. The authors also report a Pearson correlation
(with a p-value) and a regression model using aggregate data to examine the associa-
tion between annual average morbidity and annual average dust concentrations (by age
and birth cohort). No sensitivity analyses to evaluate assumptions or robustness were
presented (eg comparing results that included children with chronic respiratory disease).
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium Numbers of children, case counts and life-years included in each analysis were not pro-
vided, making it difﬁcult to evaluate statistical power. With the exception of a Pearson
correlation (using n=11 years of data) statistical testing was not reported. The authors
said there were approximately n=50 children in each birth cohort years and analyses
such were described as including 7 to 11 birth cohorts.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium Details are lacking on sample size numbers, case counts, calculation of life-years. How-
ever, there is likely sufﬁcient information on exposure categories and the birth years/age
groups included to approximately reproduce ﬁndings.

Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Low Assumptions and rationales underlying the analyses conducted are not provided. For
example, the authors do not explain whether categories used for exposure and morbid-
ity frequency were based on approximate tertiles, either for the sample as a whole or a
speciﬁc age group. The paper used descriptive time-series analyses, stratiﬁed by age, to
evaluate potential effects of acute changes in exposure on incident respiratory morbidity.
Lags of 0 to 3 days were examined. Aggregate data were used to examine the associa-
tion between mean annual exposure and mean annual morbidity rates. In addition to a
descriptive age-period-cohort analysis, the authors used a log-linear regression model to
analyze these aggregate data for one year old children although a graphical display of
these data suggested a non-linear model might have had a better ﬁt. Applying the result-
ing regression equation to an exposure level of 0.5 mg/m3 [5136 + ln(0.5 mg/m3) x 797]
indicates that this exposure predicts a mean of 4.5 cases per life-year.
Additional Comments: This retrospective study used pediatric clinic records to evaluate potential health effects of atmospheric exposure to chrysotile asbestos among children
living in Asbest City, Russia. Exposure to asbestos in the ambient air was lower than occupational levels but higher than those reported in many non-
occupational settings. Respiratory morbidity in the youngest children (but not children >2y) was higher than morbidity rates reported for Ekaterinburg, a
city 85 km away. The authors evaluated associations between acute and long-term measures of asbestos-containing dust and respiratory morbidity incidence
rates in children. They excluded children with chronic respiratory diseases from their analyses; they did not provide information on how including those
children would have affected morbidity rates. Risk of developing these respiratory conditions may be associated with asbestos exposure, and children
with these diagnoses may be more susceptible to adverse effects of dust exposure. It is not possible to ascertain to what extent these exclusions may have
inﬂuenced associations among older age groups. Analyses are primarily descriptive with no statistical testing, and methodological details are inadequately
described.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Analyses use cumulative ﬁber exposure. Additional details about exposure measurement
are reported in Lockey et al., 1984, HEROID 29685. Samples were collected via mem-
brane ﬁlters either by following an employee with a sampler (from 1972-1976) or by
breathing zone sampling (after 1976). Authors note that exposure of ﬁber was deﬁned as
"particles with a length greater than 5 um, a diameter less than 3 um, and an aspect ra-
tio of 3:1 or greater". Thus, ﬁber type was unknown, and samples likely included ﬁbers
other than asbestos. Samples were reviewed through polarized light microscopy, scan-
ning electron microscopy, and TEM. Indexes were created for each department within
the facility. Study authors used work histories reported by workers in 1980 to calcu-
late the cumulative ﬁber exposure level for each employee. Previous estimates were
revised to include additional data related to exposure collected in 2010, such as adjust-
ments for vermiculite source and changes in duration of work by season (Borton et al.,
2012, HEROID 1066035). Borton et al. also estimated exposures from 1957-1971 us-
ing estimates from 1972 with adjustments for dustier historical conditions. This study
also reported comparisons between personal and area samples and found approximately
equal means and ranges.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium For SMR and SRR analyses of lung cancer, exposure is presented in three groups based
on cumulative ﬁber exposure estimates. Authors note the possibility that associations
were not observed due to the low exposure levels among the study population, which
raises some concern about the inﬂuence of the exposure distribution on the ability to
detect an effect.
Additional Comments: QC was not completed for metrics other than Metrics 4 and 5 because the study does not have sufﬁcient exposure information to be useful for dose-response
analysis.This retrospective occupational cohort study examined the association between asbestos exposure and all cancer mortality among workers mining
and milling contaminated vermiculite. There were no major concerns with the study, aside from limited exposure distributions among the study population
and concerns about ﬁbrous co-exposures that were not characterized or quantiﬁed. Since these workers were exposed to ﬁbers that were not asbestos, it
can be assumed that these exposures inﬂuenced the observed outcomes, but they were not characterized. The approach for exposure measurement and
statistical analysis was strong, and there were no concerns about selection bias resulting from population recruitment approaches.
?No biomarkers were identiﬁed for this evaluation.
??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Analyses use cumulative ﬁber exposure. Additional details about exposure measurement
are reported in Lockey et al., 1984, HEROID 29685. Samples were collected via mem-
brane ﬁlters either by following an employee with a sampler (from 1972-1976) or by
breathing zone sampling (after 1976). Authors note that exposure of ﬁber was deﬁned as
"particles with a length greater than 5 um, a diameter less than 3 um, and an aspect ra-
tio of 3:1 or greater". Thus, ﬁber type was unknown, and samples likely included ﬁbers
other than asbestos. Samples were reviewed through polarized light microscopy, scan-
ning electron microscopy, and TEM. Indexes were created for each department within
the facility. Study authors used work histories reported by workers in 1980 to calcu-
late the cumulative ﬁber exposure level for each employee. Previous estimates were
revised to include additional data related to exposure collected in 2010, such as adjust-
ments for vermiculite source and changes in duration of work by season (Borton et al.,
2012, HEROID 1066035). Borton et al. also estimated exposures from 1957-1971 us-
ing estimates from 1972 with adjustments for dustier historical conditions. This study
also reported comparisons between personal and area samples and found approximately
equal means and ranges.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low For SMR analyses of all-cause mortality, exposure is presented in two groups only (ex-
posed workers and unexposed US general population). Authors note the possibility that
associations were not observed due to the low exposure levels among the study popula-
tion, which raises some concern about the inﬂuence of the exposure distribution on the
ability to detect an effect.
Additional Comments: QC was not completed for metrics other than Metrics 4 and 5 because the study does not have sufﬁcient exposure information to be useful for dose-response
analysis.This retrospective occupational cohort study examined the association between asbestos exposure and all cause mortality among workers mining
and milling contaminated vermiculite. There were no major concerns with the study, aside from limited exposure distributions among the study population
and concerns about ﬁbrous co-exposures that were not characterized or quantiﬁed. Since these workers were exposed to ﬁbers that were not asbestos, it
can be assumed that these exposures inﬂuenced the observed outcomes, but they were not characterized. The approach for exposure measurement and
statistical analysis was strong, and there were no concerns about selection bias resulting from population recruitment approaches.
?No biomarkers were identiﬁed for this evaluation.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Clin et al. 2011, HERO ID: 3078903 analyzed the risk of cancers among salaried and
retired workers (men and women) from an asbestos reprocessing plant (textiles and fric-
tion materials) in the Calvados department in Normandy, France. Eligibility was based
on: (i) working at the plant for at least 1 year; (ii) being alive in 1978 when the regional
cancer registry was established; (iii) having resided in Calvados during at least part of
the 1978 to 1995 initial follow-up period, with known vital status (de la Provote et al
al. 2002, HERO ID: 3520580). As noted by Clin et al. 2011, HERO ID: 3078903, "...
since one of our inclusion criteria was that subjects had to be alive in 1978, there may be
a selection bias related to the "healthy worker effect"." Including retired workers, how-
ever, would have helped to reduce this bias. The number of workers who did not meet
eligibility criteria was not provided; it is unknown whether a large number of workers of
similar age and employment duration as those in the cohort had cancer diagnoses prior
to 1978, which could bias results. The factories had operated using asbestos in various
capacities since 1928. All cancer cases from 1978 to 1996 were included, resulting in
1820 subjects (1454 men).
Metric 2: Attrition High De la Provote et al al. 2002, HERO ID: 3520580 reported that 152 subjects (8.4% ) had
missing vital status at the end of 1995 and were excluded from analysis. It is unclear
why vital status was missing, but given the relatively small share of subjects and that it
would not be expected to be related exposure and outcome make this a limited concern
for bias.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium In calculating relative risk for cancers, workers with varying concentrations of exposures
were compared amongst each other. There is no indication that groups were similar, but
there is no indication of healthy worker effect.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Exposure estimates were assigned to individuals based on job functions and timing/
duration of employment and ﬁber count measures. As described by de la Provote et
al. 2002, HERO ID: 3520580, ﬁber counts were measured at different locations in the
plant as follows: (i) 1973 -1995 data were collected by Casella pumps on a membrane
ﬁlter, with PCM (phase-contrast light microscopy) counts of ﬁbers longer than 5 mm,
less than 3 mm in diameter, with a length/diameter ratio greater than 3; (ii) 1960-1974
data were collected on soluble ﬁlters by an ARM (Avy"Raillere"Martin) apparatus,
with light microscopy ﬁber counts as particles per liter of air; and (iii) estimates prior to
1959/1960 were based on production reports for 1939-1945 [50% of 1960 levels], lin-
early extrapolated to 1960. Date cutoffs differed slightly across manuscripts [e.g. ARM
started in 1959 vs 1960 according to Clin et al. 2011, HERO ID: 3078903]. Side-by-side
Casella vs. ARM method measures in 1974 were used to develop a conversion factor for
the different methods. A cumulative exposure index (CEI) for the entire career (ﬁbers/
mL * year) was calculated as the sum of exposure * duration for each job position. A
mean exposure concentration (MEC), also referred to as averaged exposure (AEL) was
also calculated and expressed in ﬁbers/mL). Clin et al. 2009, HERO ID: 3520549 and
Boulanger et al. 2017, HERO ID: 3077730 explain these same methods but in lesser de-
tail. Clin et al. 2011, HERO ID: 3078903 uses CEI and AEL exposure categories with a
10-year lag to account for latency.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium To estimate cancer risk, only de la Provote et al. 2002, HERO ID: 3520580 categorized
asbestos exposure variables using >=3 ordinal levels. Of note is that only mean cumu-
lative exposure, not cumulative exposure index values were used in adjusted models.In
Clin et al. 2009, HERO ID: 3520549 and Boulanger et al. 2015, HERO ID: 307773,
SIRs are only calculated using 2 exposure categories of cumulative exposure, such as
exposed/unexposed or <= vs>80 ﬁbers/mL-year, all of which merit a Low rating for
this metric. Because of this, Clin et al. 2009, HERO ID: 3520549 and Boulanger et al.
2015, HERO ID: 307773 are only evaluated for metrics 4 and 5 in this entry.
Metric 6: Temporality High De la Provote et al. 2002, HERO ID: 3520580 shows that 69% of workers had at least
10 years at work, and 50% had >= 20 years.
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationUninformative Other Cancer(s): The outcome is a combination of all digestive cancers, thus meriting an
uninformative rating.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High De la Provote et al. 2002, HERO ID: 3520580 reported ﬁndings in the abstract, results,
and discussion sections adequately, where conﬁdence intervals are provided for relative
risk estimates. P-values and numbers of cases were also presented in detail.

latency (time dependent) and years at the company, but not sex. Data on smoking were

Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium De la Provote et al. 2002, HERO ID: 3520580 used a Cox hazard model to analyze
the dose-response relationship of occupational asbestos exposure (mean cumulative
exposure only) and risk of digestive cancer.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium De la Provote et al. 2002, HERO ID: 3520580 likely has adequate power to detect an
association (total n=1820, n cases=56).
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The descriptions of analyses are clear and sufﬁciently well-written to conceptually re-

Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium The authors describe appropriate methods and note that the assumption of proportional
hazards was checked graphically.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Clin et al. 2011, HERO ID: 3078903 analyzed the risk of cancers among salaried and
retired workers (men and women) from an asbestos reprocessing plant (textiles and fric-
tion materials) in the Calvados department in Normandy, France. Eligibility was based
on: (i) working at the plant for at least 1 year; (ii) being alive in 1978 when the regional
cancer registry was established; (iii) having resided in Calvados during at least part of
the 1978 to 1995 initial follow-up period, with known vital status (de la Provote et al
al. 2002, HERO ID: 3520580). As noted by Clin et al. 2011, HERO ID: 3078903, "...
since one of our inclusion criteria was that subjects had to be alive in 1978, there may be
a selection bias related to the "healthy worker effect"." Including retired workers, how-
ever, would have helped to reduce this bias. The number of workers who did not meet
eligibility criteria was not provided; it is unknown whether a large number of workers of
similar age and employment duration as those in the cohort had cancer diagnoses prior
to 1978, which could bias results. The factories had operated using asbestos in various
capacities since 1928. All cancer cases from 1978 to 2004 were included, resulting in
2024 subjects (1604 men).
Metric 2: Attrition High Clin et al. 2011, HERO ID: 3078903 reported that 107 subjects (5.3% ) had missing
vital status at the end of 2004 and were excluded from analysis. It is unclear why vital
status was missing, but given the relatively small share of subjects and that it would not
be expected to be related exposure and outcome make this a limited concern for bias.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium In calculating relative risk for cancers, workers with varying concentrations of exposures
were compared amongst each other. There is no indication that groups were similar, but
there is no indication of healthy worker effect.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Exposure estimates were assigned to individuals based on job functions and timing/
duration of employment and ﬁber count measures. As described by de la Provote et
al. 2002, HERO ID: 3520580, ﬁber counts were measured at different locations in the
plant as follows: (i) 1973 -1995 data were collected by Casella pumps on a membrane
ﬁlter, with PCM (phase-contrast light microscopy) counts of ﬁbers longer than 5 mm,
less than 3 mm in diameter, with a length/diameter ratio greater than 3; (ii) 1960-1974
data were collected on soluble ﬁlters by an ARM (Avy"Raillere"Martin) apparatus,
with light microscopy ﬁber counts as particles per liter of air; and (iii) estimates prior to
1959/1960 were based on production reports for 1939-1945 [50% of 1960 levels], lin-
early extrapolated to 1960. Date cutoffs differed slightly across manuscripts [e.g. ARM
started in 1959 vs 1960 according to Clin et al. 2011, HERO ID: 3078903]. Side-by-side
Casella vs. ARM method measures in 1974 were used to develop a conversion factor for
the different methods. A cumulative exposure index (CEI) for the entire career (ﬁbers/
mL * year) was calculated as the sum of exposure * duration for each job position. A
mean exposure concentration (MEC), also referred to as averaged exposure (AEL) was
also calculated and expressed in ﬁbers/mL). Clin et al. 2009, HERO ID: 3520549 and
Boulanger et al. 2017, HERO ID: 3077730 explain these same methods but in lesser de-
tail. Clin et al. 2011, HERO ID: 3078903 uses CEI and AEL exposure categories with a
10-year lag to account for latency.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium To estimate cancer risk, only Clin et al. 2011, HERO ID: 3078903 categorized asbestos
exposure variables using 3 ordinal levels.In Clin et al. 2009, HERO ID: 3520549 and
Boulanger et al. 2015, HERO ID: 307773, SIRs are only calculated using 2 exposure
categories of cumulative exposure, such as exposed/unexposed or <= vs>80 ﬁbers/
mL-year, all of which merit a Low rating for this metric. In de la Provote et al. 2002,
HERO ID: 3520580, only the "All digestive cancers" outcomes in analyzed with more
than dichotomous exposure categories, but is evaluated in a different entry because
the outcome is rated differently. All other outcomes in that study have dichotomous
exposure categories. Because of this, de la Provote et al. 2002, HERO ID: 3520580, Clin
et al. 2009, HERO ID: 3520549, and Boulanger et al. 2015, HERO ID: 307773, are only
evaluated for metrics 4 and 5 in this entry.
Metric 6: Temporality High While Clin et al. 2011, HERO ID: 3078903 gives limited detail on temporality, de la
Provote et al. 2002, HERO ID: 3520580 shows that 69% of workers had at least 10 years
at work, and 50% had >= 20 years.

Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationHigh Lung Cancer: In Clin et al. 2011, HERO ID: 3078903, lung cancer incidence outcomes
were characterized by histology in a cancer registry: "The incidence of cancer was ac-
cordingly estimated for each anatomical cancer site (ICD-O 3 coding). Only primary
cancers were taken into account in our study, secondary cancer sites having been ex-
cluded. No subjects presented with secondary cancer at the same site. For subjects pre-
senting with primary cancers at different anatomical sites, each cancer was considered
independently in our analysis." "The table in the online supplementary appendix lists
(ICD-O 3 codes) the number of observed cancers for the entire cohort site by site and
separately for each sex, together with latency (time to diagnosis since ﬁrst exposure) and
age at diagnosis." At the time of evaluation, the supplemental material was not freely
available and thus cannot be taken into account. However, because cases were diag-
nosed with histologies, this metric is rated High.; Other Cancer(s): In Clin et al. 2011,
HERO ID: 3078903, lung cancer incidence outcomes were characterized by histology in
a cancer registry: "The incidence of cancer was accordingly estimated for each anatom-
ical cancer site (ICD-O 3 coding). Only primary cancers were taken into account in our
study, secondary cancer sites having been excluded. No subjects presented with sec-
ondary cancer at the same site. For subjects presenting with primary cancers at different
anatomical sites, each cancer was considered independently in our analysis." "The table
in the online supplementary appendix lists (ICD-O 3 codes) the number of observed can-
cers for the entire cohort site by site and separately for each sex, together with latency
(time to diagnosis since ﬁrst exposure) and age at diagnosis." At the time of evalua-
tion, the supplemental material was not freely available and thus cannot be taken into
account. However, because cases were diagnosed with histologies, this metric is rated
High.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High Clin et al. 2011, HERO ID: 3078903 reported ﬁndings in the abstract, results, and dis-
cussion sections adequately, where conﬁdence intervals are provided for relative risk
estimates. P-values and numbers of cases were also presented in detail.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment High Clin et al. 2011, HERO ID: 3078903 adjusted models by sex and age (time dependent).
Data on smoking were not available. Race was not discussed, although it is likely that
the population was largely white.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium Information on covariates was obtained from the company’s occupational health depart-
ment records.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low There was no discussion of coexposures at these factories.

Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium Clin et al. 2011, HERO ID: 3078903 used a Cox hazard model to analyze the dose-
response relationship of occupational asbestos exposure and risk of cancer.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium Clin et al. 2011, HERO ID: 3078903 likely has adequate power to detect an association
(total n=2024), with the cancer having the fewest cases being for female genital tract

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low This study or any cited methods source does not explicitly mention the use of PCM or
TEM.Individual cumulative exposure level was determined by self-reported job history
and periods of exposure using a computer program based on ambient air monitoring
data of asbestos concentration, recall bias is likely to be present. The measurement and
quantifying methods were not speciﬁed. There is little information about exposure mea-
surement and mainly based on professional judgement. Exposure misclassiﬁcation is
likely to exist according to the exposure measurement methods.Study cites another pa-
per (Felten et al., 2010, 2584064) that discusses ambient asbestos measuring techniques
with no indication of the use of PCM/TEM to measure ﬁbers: "The ambient monitor-
ing data used in the report covered a period of four decades from the beginning of the
1950s until 1990. In the 1970s, the original technique of konimetrical measurements
was gradually replaced with membrane ﬁlter techniques applying a deﬁned airﬂow. Both
methods were not speciﬁc for asbestos ﬁbres. That deﬁcit was overcome by combining
membranous ﬁltering systems with the microscopical count of ﬁbres."
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The distribution of cumulative exposure level is sufﬁcient to develop an exposure-
outcome estimate. The study used 3 levels of exposure.
Additional Comments: The main concern of this group of studies is exposure measurement, which is based on computer program and self-reported work history, could introduce
exposure misclassiﬁcation to the analysis. In addition, high attrition plus missing exposure values could impact the accuracy of the results.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Authors state that estimates of exposure were calculated through the use of a "model that
extrapolated measurements made by the personal membrane ﬁlter" and did not utilize
PCM or TEM. There appears to be a contradiction in time in that the personal membrane
ﬁlters was utilized by the industrial in 1969 (21 years after the plant opened in 1948).
The cohort includes workers hired prior to 1960 so it is unclear what exposure data was
used for workers who had worked for there before 1969.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Estimates of 18-year cumulative exposure since ﬁrst exposure is provided in Table 2 and

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low This metric is rated Low because the study or any cited methods source does not explic-
itly mention the use of PCM or TEM. The estimated average cumulative exposure of
the production workers was about 60 ﬁber-years/mL (chrysotile and crocidolite). The
estimated mean cumulative exposure within the board shop, in which chrysotile was the
sole asbestos type utilized, was 39 f-y/mL. Air sampling data from government, insur-
ance and company hygienists initiated in late 1969 were utilized along with company
employment records to classify each production worker (n=186) according to estimated
annual cumulative asbestos exposure as described within Finkelstein et al., 1983 (HERO
ID 3100548), which also referenced Finkelstein, 1982 (HERO ID 76). Microscopic
method of ﬁber analysis (PCM or TEM) was not detailed in main or referenced text. Air
sampling data was obtained from only later factory years (late 1969 onward) and was
not representative of earlier years, although assumptions for exposure levels for those
earlier years were supported by impinger area sampling data. Air sampling data from
government, insurance and company hygienists initiated in late 1969 were utilized along
with company employment records to classify each production worker (n=186) accord-
ing to estimated annual cumulative asbestos exposure as described within Finkelstein
et al., 1983 (HERO ID 3100548) and Finkelstein, 1982 (HERO ID 76). Eighteen-year
cumulative exposures were calculated for the production workers (Table 7) by combin-
ing work histories and exposure estimates, with job-related exposures multiplied by the
time spent at each job and summed over the 18 years from ﬁrst exposure. Workers were
assigned to an exposure category according to their 18-year exposure totals. Exposures
were assumed to have been unchanged from 1962 to 1970, to have been 30% higher
from 1955 to 1961, and to have been twice as high from 1948 to 1954, with assumptions
supported by impinger area sampling performed 1949 through the 1960"s. Raw mate-
rials in the production worker pipe manufacturing process included cement, silica and
both chrysotile and crocidolite asbestos, while the asbestos cement board production
utilized chrysotile asbestos only. Comparison control workers were primarily within the
rock wool/ﬁberglass insulation production area, although authors noted it was possible
for employees to be assigned to the pipe shop for brief clean-up duties, or re-assigned
from non-asbestos to asbestos work areas, such that some control workers were exposed
as well. Exposures for maintenance workers were not calculated due to inadequate data.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range and distribution of asbestos exposure in Table 7 presented across ﬁve expo-
sure categories ranging from <=30 ﬁber-years/ML through >150 ﬁber-years/mL for
production workers is sufﬁcient to develop an exposure-response estimate.

Additional Comments: QC was not completed for metrics other than Metrics 4 and 5 because the study does not have sufﬁcient exposure information to be useful for dose-
response analysis.NOTE: This study would not be evaluated under the current guidelines. This is due to the low rating for metric 4, as no PCM or TEM
was mentioned in the study or a cited source.Within this retrospective cohort study, mortality among asbestos exposed (n=535, production and maintenance
workers) and control (n=205) male employees (total n=740) of an asbestos cement pipe manufacturing factory with a minimum of one year employment
who had been hired prior to 1960 was compared with mortality of the Ontario, Canada male general population over a period of 10 to 34 years of follow-
up. Workers were divided into three groups for study: production workers involved in asbestos cement pipe manufacture, maintenance workers, and
those involved in rock wool and ﬁberglass insulation or other minimal exposure areas who were classiﬁed as non-exposed controls. Factory production of
asbestos cement pipe in one shed and rock wool (later ﬁberglass) insulation in another shed began in 1948, and asbestos cement board was produced in
a separate building from 1955 to 1970. Air sampling data from government, insurance and company hygienists initiated in late 1969 were utilized along
with company employment records to classify each production worker (n=186) according to estimated annual cumulative asbestos exposure. Air sampling
data was obtained from only later factory years (late 1969 onward) and was not representative of earlier years, although assumptions for exposure levels for
those earlier years were supported by impinger area sampling data. In the period 20 years from ﬁrst exposure, the production workers had a standardized
mortality ratio of 181 for all causes of death, 320 for non-malignant respiratory disease, and 58 for ischemic heart disease.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Key elements of the study design were reported within this retrospective cohort study
of long-term male workers in which n=339 male asbestos workers hired prior to 1960
and employed by the same company in Ontario, Canada for at least nine years were
followed until 31 October 1980 for mortality outcomes of interest. An additional n=11
men (3.2% of the total) could not be properly classiﬁed from their work histories as
production, maintenance or rock wool/ﬁberglass workers and were excluded from the
current analysis. Participants were identiﬁed from company records of all hourly and
salaried employees who had worked at the plant of interest. Employees were excluded
if they did not work for at least nine years to account for the long latency of asbestos-
related diseases and difﬁculties of tracing short-term employees. There is no evidence
to suggest inclusion or exclusion from the sample differed signiﬁcantly by outcome or
exposure status.
Metric 2: Attrition Low Ofﬁcial death certiﬁcates were obtained for all men who had died. However, a total of
ﬁve (2.7% ) of the n=186 production workers, three (5.5% ) of the n=55 maintenance
workers and ﬁve (5.7% ) of the n=87 unexposed or minimally exposed workers were
unable to be traced for mortality outcomes and were assumed still alive for analysis. A
group of 55 maintenance workers were originally included, but later excluded as the
study reported that it "was not thought possible to estimate exposures for the mainte-
nance men."

Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium Inclusion criteria and methods of participant selection were reported. Workers within
the rock wool/ﬁber glass operations (n=87) were classiﬁed as minimally exposed, had
mortality described as similar to the general male Ontario population and were utilized
as the comparison control workers. SMR analyses results utilized the age and calendar
speciﬁc mortality experience of the male Ontario general population as a comparison
group for expected mortality rates. The mean age at the start of exposure or employment
was described as similar between the exposed and general populations. Comparison
control workers were primarily within the rock wool/ﬁberglass insulation production
area, although the author of the current study noted in another publication (Finkelstein
et al., 1983, HERO ID 3083612) of workers in the same factory that it was possible
for employees to be assigned to the pipe shop for brief clean-up duties, or re-assigned
from non-asbestos to asbestos work areas, such that some control workers may have
been exposed as well. There is potential for healthy worker effect in terms of left trunca-
tion bias, as the cohort for the current study was restricted to workers with at least nine
years of employment, such that all workers had to survive for at least nine years to be in-
cluded. However, Table 2 SMR results for non-malignant respiratory disease indicate no
evidence of healthy worker effect in terms of the healthy hire or healthy worker survivor
effect.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium The microscopic method (PCM or TEM) of analysis of air sampling data reported in
Table 1 with outcome mortality rates was not detailed. The average estimated cumula-
tive exposure among production workers was reported for three groups of production
workers of 62 men each as 44 f-y/ml, 92 f-y/ml, and 180 f-y/mL (chrysotile and cro-
cidolite). Groups were created on the basis of ranking 18-year cumulative exposures.
Air sampling data from government, insurance and company hygienists initiated in late
1969 was utilized along with company employment records to classify each production
worker"s exposure, however production within the plant began in 1948 and measured
exposures for periods 1948-1970 were lacking and assumed as related to the quantita-
tive measurements made beginning in 1969. Exposures for maintenance workers was
described as not calculated due to inadequate data. Estimated cumulative exposure for
only the ﬁrst 18 years of employment was utilized such that for men employed less than
18 years this parameter was used and for men employed more than 18 years, the po-
tential exposures after 18 years were excluded. Exposures were assumed to have been
unchanged from 1962 to 1970, to have been 30% higher from 1955 to 1961, and to have
been twice as high from 1948 to 1954, with assumptions supported by impinger area
sampling performed 1949 through the 1960"s. Based on subsequent discussion and
review of additional information, the rating was adjusted based on impinger data was
collected and personal membrane sampling was conducted beginning in late 1969 and
detailed employment records were used to construct exposure histories.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range and distribution of estimated exposures is reported within Table 1 for pro-
duction workers as 8 to 420 ﬁber-years/mL. Table 1 provides the mortality rates for
production workers across three groups of exposure categories.
Metric 6: Temporality High The study presents an appropriate temporality and the interval between exposure and
outcome is appropriate considering the latency of disease. Workers were required to
have been hired before 1960 and were followed up until 1980, ensuring at least 20 years
of follow-up for the cohort
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationHigh Lung Cancer: ICD code 162 was utilized for lung cancer outcomes on ofﬁcial death
certiﬁcates for all men who had died. Additional clinical, pathological and necropsy
reports were available for n=44 of the n=58 deaths among production workers and are
used in analyses of exposure duration, but not of exposure concentration.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium There were no concerns for selective reporting. SMR"s in Table 2 and mortality rates
across age and time since ﬁrst exposure groups per man years in production workers
in Table 3 were reported as single values, with no measures of variation or conﬁdence
intervals. Conﬁdence intervals for speciﬁc outcomes were reported within the text.

Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium Other than stratiﬁcation for years since ﬁrst exposure and age, no additional adjustments
or consideration for differences between exposed and non-exposed groups regarding
distributions of relevant covariates were detailed. The cohort for study was restricted to
males. The authors mention that information for smoking was available for 70% of the
cohort, but this information is not used in statistical analyses. The authors state that data
was available for 17 of 20 men who had died of lung cancer: 1 never smoked, 2 had quit
for 10 or more years, and 14 were smokers. Based on subsequent discussion and review
of additional information, the rating was adjusted based on stratiﬁcation by age and only
males being included in the study.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium Finkelstein, 1982 provides evidence of detailed personnel ﬁles use for TSFE, age, job
history, etc.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Medium For lung cancer, there was no evidence of co-exposure or unbalanced provision of co-
exposures.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The study design was appropriate as an early study to address the research aims. Two
types of comparisons were performed, internal and external. Table 2 SMR results were
obtained through external comparisons by applying the Ontario general population mor-
tality rates as reference and presented for production, maintenance and control workers.
Table 3 mortality rate results were presented for production workers stratiﬁed across age
and years since ﬁrst exposure groups. Tests for trend were not reported.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The number of participants was adequate, however formal statistical comparisons be-
tween exposed and non-exposed workers, or across time since ﬁrst exposure groups,
were not presented. SMR results in Table 2 were reported for the n=328 workers, while
results in Table 3 were reported only for the n=186 production workers.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The data are presented in Table 1 that were used used in the 1986 analysis. Reporting
errors are present in Table 2, but these data are not used in the 1986 analysis.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium Model building was not conducted. The construction of SMRs appears appropriate.

and employed by the same company in Ontario, Canada for at least nine years were followed until 31 October 1980 for mortality outcomes of interest.
Concerns included the assumption that workers unable to be traced for mortality outcomes were still alive at the end of follow-up, with no sensitivity
analyses conducted to examine results with and without these workers. Lung cancer mortality was obtained utilizing pre-ICD 10 coding. Exposure
concentrations are provided for three groups of exposure in relation to a reference population of Ontario men by outcome - however, no statistical analysis
is done to compare mortality using exposure concentration data, limiting the study’s usefulness for dose-response analysis.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Key elements of the study design were reported within this retrospective cohort study
of long-term male workers in which n=339 male asbestos workers hired prior to 1960
and employed by the same company in Ontario, Canada for at least nine years were
followed until 31 October 1980 for mortality outcomes of interest. An additional n=11
men (3.2% of the total) could not be properly classiﬁed from their work histories as
production, maintenance or rock wool/ﬁberglass workers and were excluded from the
current analysis. Participants were identiﬁed from company records of all hourly and
salaried employees who had worked at the plant of interest. Employees were excluded
if they did not work for at least nine years to account for the long latency of asbestos-
related diseases and difﬁculties of tracing short-term employees. There is no evidence
to suggest inclusion or exclusion from the sample differed signiﬁcantly by outcome or
exposure status.
Metric 2: Attrition Low Ofﬁcial death certiﬁcates were obtained for all men who had died. However, a total of
ﬁve (2.7% ) of the n=186 production workers, three (5.5% ) of the n=55 maintenance
workers and ﬁve (5.7% ) of the n=87 unexposed or minimally exposed workers were
unable to be traced for mortality outcomes and were assumed still alive for analysis. A
group of 55 maintenance workers were originally included, but later excluded as the
study reported that it "was not thought possible to estimate exposures for the mainte-
nance men."

Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium Inclusion criteria and methods of participant selection were reported. Workers within
the rock wool/ﬁber glass operations (n=87) were classiﬁed as minimally exposed, had
mortality described as similar to the general male Ontario population and were utilized
as the comparison control workers. SMR analyses results utilized the age and calendar
speciﬁc mortality experience of the male Ontario general population as a comparison
group for expected mortality rates. The mean age at the start of exposure or employment
was described as similar between the exposed and general populations. Comparison
control workers were primarily within the rock wool/ﬁberglass insulation production
area, although the author of the current study noted in another publication (Finkelstein
et al., 1983, HERO ID 3083612) of workers in the same factory that it was possible
for employees to be assigned to the pipe shop for brief clean-up duties, or re-assigned
from non-asbestos to asbestos work areas, such that some control workers may have
been exposed as well. There is potential for healthy worker effect in terms of left trunca-
tion bias, as the cohort for the current study was restricted to workers with at least nine
years of employment, such that all workers had to survive for at least nine years to be in-
cluded. However, Table 2 SMR results for non-malignant respiratory disease indicate no
evidence of healthy worker effect in terms of the healthy hire or healthy worker survivor
effect.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low The microscopic method (PCM or TEM) of analysis of air sampling data reported in
Table 1 with outcome mortality rates was not detailed. The average estimated cumula-
tive exposure among production workers was reported for three groups of production
workers of 62 men each as 44 f-y/ml, 92 f-y/ml, and 180 f-y/mL (chrysotile and cro-
cidolite). Groups were created on the basis of ranking 18-year cumulative exposures.
Air sampling data from government, insurance and company hygienists initiated in late
1969 was utilized along with company employment records to classify each production
worker"s exposure, however production within the plant began in 1948 and measured
exposures for periods 1948-1970 were lacking and assumed as related to the quantita-
tive measurements made beginning in 1969. Exposures for maintenance workers was
described as not calculated due to inadequate data. Estimated cumulative exposure for
only the ﬁrst 18 years of employment was utilized such that for men employed less than
18 years this parameter was used and for men employed more than 18 years, the po-
tential exposures after 18 years were excluded. Exposures were assumed to have been
unchanged from 1962 to 1970, to have been 30% higher from 1955 to 1961, and to have
been twice as high from 1948 to 1954, with assumptions supported by impinger area
sampling performed 1949 through the 1960"s.

Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationMedium Other Cancer(s): Follow-up for mortality was described as conducted by a local trace
supplemented by a mortality search performed by Statistics Canada. Mortality rates
from mesothelioma, lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, and all malignancies deaths
were assessed in production workers and compared with the Ontario general population
rates in Table 1 (no ICD codes reported). Mortality rates in Table 2 from all-cause mor-
tality, all malignancies (ICD codes 140-209), lung cancer (ICD code 162), mesothelioma
(ICD codes 163, 158, 228), gastrointestinal cancer (ICD codes 150-154), non-malignant
respiratory disease (ICD codes 460-519) and ischemic heart disease (ICD codes 410-
414) deaths were reported for production workers, production plus maintenance workers
and control workers. Ofﬁcial death certiﬁcates were obtained for all men who had died.
For those production workers (n=5), maintenance workers (n=3) and control workers
(n=5) who were untraceable, authors assumed these workers were still alive at the end
of follow-up, 31 October 1980. Additional clinical, pathological and necropsy reports
were available for n=44 of the n=58 deaths among production workers and are used in
analyses of exposure duration, but not of exposure concentration.; Other Non-Cancer
Outcomes: Follow-up for mortality was described as conducted by a local trace sup-
plemented by a mortality search performed by Statistics Canada. Mortality rates from
mesothelioma, lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, and all malignancies deaths were
assessed in production workers and compared with the Ontario general population rates
in Table 1 (no ICD codes reported). Mortality rates in Table 2 from all-cause mortal-
ity, all malignancies (ICD codes 140-209), lung cancer (ICD code 162), mesothelioma
(ICD codes 163, 158, 228), gastrointestinal cancer (ICD codes 150-154), non-malignant
respiratory disease (ICD codes 460-519) and ischemic heart disease (ICD codes 410-

Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium There were no concerns for selective reporting. SMRs in Table 2 and mortality rates
across age and time since ﬁrst exposure groups per man years in production workers
in Table 3 were reported as single values, with no measures of variation or conﬁdence
intervals. Conﬁdence intervals for speciﬁc outcomes were reported within the text.

Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Low Other than stratiﬁcation for years since ﬁrst exposure and age, no additional adjustments
or consideration for differences between exposed and non-exposed groups regarding
distributions of relevant covariates were detailed. The cohort for study was restricted to
males. The authors mention that information for smoking was available for 70% of the
cohort, but this information is not used in statistical analyses. .
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Low Although not speciﬁed within this occupational study, it is assumed that personnel ﬁles
were utilized to obtain age and time since ﬁrst employed/exposed data.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low The members of the cohort were employees of an Ontario asbestos cement pipe man-
ufacturing factory classiﬁed as production, maintenance and factory control workers.
In addition to chrysotile and crocidolite asbestos, authors noted production of asbestos
cement pipe included exposures to cement and silica, which were not accounted for.
Considerations for workers who might have initially left and worked elsewhere with ad-
ditional exposures but eventually returned to asbestos work were not detailed. However,
there was no evidence that there was an unbalanced provision of co-exposures among
exposure groups.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The study design was appropriate as an early study to address the research aims. Two
types of comparisons were performed, internal and external. Table 2 SMR results were
obtained through external comparisons by applying the Ontario general population mor-
tality rates as reference and presented for production, maintenance and control workers.
Table 3 mortality rate results were presented for production workers stratiﬁed across age
and years since ﬁrst exposure groups. Tests for trend were not reported.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The number of participants was adequate, however formal statistical comparisons be-
tween exposed and non-exposed workers, or across time since ﬁrst exposure groups,
were not presented. SMR results in Table 2 were reported for the n=328 workers, while
results in Table 3 were reported only for the n=186 production workers.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Low The only table presenting results and exposures was Table 1, which reported mortality
rates across each exposure group (A, B and C) and estimated mean and range of expo-
sures within each exposure group. However, no formal statistical analysis was conducted
to examine the statistical differences between the less exposed (Group A) and more
exposed (Group C) groups. The description of this, as well as SMR results in Table 2
and mortality rates in production workers in Table 3 is generally sufﬁcient to under-
stand. Some of Table 2 observed /expected (SMR) results were unclear, as with the
non-malignant respiratory disease SMR for production workers within the 15-19 years
since ﬁrst exposure group, where the observed mortality was 1, the expected was 0.4,
but the reported SMR is 1.0, rather than 2.5.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low This metric is rated Low because the study or any cited methods source does not ex-
plicitly mention the use of PCM or TEM.Air sampling was conducted by different enti-
ties including the government, the asbestos cement company, and insurance hygienists
(Finkelstein, 1982, HEROID: 76). Measurements were primarily made through impinger
area sampling (Finkelstein, 1982, HEROID: 76). In 1969, personal membrane ﬁlters
were used (Finkelstein, 1982, HEROID: 76). Because of the infrequent consistency of
reporting exposure, extrapolations were needed for missing time frames (Finkelstein,
1982, HEROID: 76).Authors described the following for calculation expose and dose
estimation: "Cumulative exposures were calculated for each man by summing annual
exposures accumulated during the ﬁrst 18 years from the start of exposure. Asbestos
dosages were calculated by assuming that a ﬁxed proportion of the workplace air con-
centrations were deposited in the lungs, and each year’s accumulation was weighted by
the residence time in lung tissue (the formulas used are given in the appendix). Cumula-
tive exposures had been estimated to be accurate to within a factor of 3 to 5."
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The distribution of exposure appears to be sufﬁcient to develop an exposure-response
estimate. Cumulative exposure (f-y/ml) and dose (f/ml*yr-squared) for calculating cu-
mulative risk were utilized in statistical models. Range or other measure distribution is
not present in this paper, however Figures 1 and 2 show values ranging from 0-6,000
ﬁbers/mL x year^ 2.
Additional Comments: Finkelstein, 1982, HEROID: 76 reported the dominant asbestos ﬁbers were crocidolite and chrysotile. QCer may want to review Metric 9 to ensure
appropriate rating. QC was not completed for metrics other than Metrics 4 and 5 because the study does not have sufﬁcient exposure information to be

cohort was stratiﬁed for exposure by the method described by Breslow (Breslow, 1979).
These include estimation of the survival curve, nonparametric tests to compare several
survival curves, tests for trend, and regression analysis.

181 men, separated into 5 exposure groups (A=32, B=68, C=41, D=25, E=15)
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Low The description of the analysis is insufﬁcient to understand what has been done and to
be reproducible. Other papers are referenced for methods and mortality data, but not
entirely clear as to what methodology was used.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium "Life-table analyses were performed using a computer program" and "risk was assessed
by calculating the 32-year cumulative probability of developing ’certiﬁed asbestosis’"
and "relative risk was calculated by assuming that if exposure were irrelevant to risk
of developing an abnormality, then at each examination the abnormalities would be
distributed among the exposure categories solely on the basis of the proportion of the
population at risk to be found in each category (the expected number). The expected
numbers were summed over the follow-up interval, and the number of abnormalities
actually observed in each exposure group was compared with the total expected. This
approach allowed statistical testing for equality of the "survival" distributions and for
trend with exposure" (Thomas et al., HERO ID 196727 ; Breslow, 1979).
Additional Comments: Studied the development of small irregular opacities and bilateral pleural thickening on radiograph in longitudinal cohort study of 181 asbestos and silica-
exposed male cement factory workers in Ontario. Co-exposure to silica not measured/analyzed but mentioned. Methods for stratifying by age and smoking
status not clearly outlined. Mortality data included and referenced from another earlier cohort, but not included in extraction as study did not appear to be
producing new results.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium This cross-sectional study examined the relationship between pulmonary function and
exposures to talc containing anthophyllite and tremolite ﬁbers in talc workers (n=93)
versus potash miners (n=1,077) and versus synthetic textile workers. A total of n=121
workers (78% of the n=156 total miller and miner work force) participated, however
results were restricted to the n=93 males who had only worked at the talc mine and mill
under study. Participation rates were noted as similar across different work areas. Par-
ticipants and non-participants were noted to have had similar average exposure duration
in years (10.2 years for participants, 10.5 years for non-participants). Selection process
and participation rates for potash and synthetic textile comparison group worker data not
detailed.
Metric 2: Attrition Medium Talc millers and miner participants not working at the talc mine and mill under study
(n=28) were excluded, however sensitivity analyses revealed similar results when all
121 participants of the original n=156 male talc workforce were included in the anal-
yses. Comparison population consisted of n=1,077 potash mine workers and synthetic
textile workers (Table 10), however details on any exclusions involved in the creation
of the comparison populations not detailed. Missing data not detailed for talc miners or
comparison populations.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium Demographics between talc workers and potash workers noted as comparable with a
few exceptions for those with less than 15 years employment (non-smoking talc workers
were younger than potash workers, smoking talc workers smoked more than potash
workers) and for those with more than 15 years of exposure (potash non-smokers and
ex-smokers were slightly older than talc workers and smoking talc workers smoked
less daily but had more overall pack-years than potash workers). However, workers in
each population were grouped into or adjusted for categories of similar age, smoking
and duration of mining employment for stratiﬁed and regression analyses. Uncertainty
regarding potential healthy worker effects as prevalent hires comprised the available
population for study. Further uncertainty in utilizing potash workers and synthetic textile
workers as comparison groups with the potential for asbestos ﬁbers within potash mines,
as well as the potential for pulmonary function changes in workers exposed to synthetic
ﬁbers.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Personal air samples were collected from miners and millers to determine the time-
weighted average (TWA) exposure to respirable dust, free silica, and asbestos ﬁbers.
Sampling methods described in terms of sampling equipment, procedures and study site
characteristics for talc miners, with sampling equipment and procedures described for
potash miner exposures. Analytic methodology described in terms of instrumentation
(electron microscopy on a random sample) and standard (NIOSH phase contrast count-
ing technique) methods for talc miners and in terms of instrumentation (for total dust,
percent free silica, NO2, but not area total respirable particulate sampling) for potash
miners. Estimated personal exposure to respirable particulates in potash miners was cal-
culated from averaged proportions of total particulate from area sampling within each
potash mine. Cumulative exposure for talc and potash miners described as calculated
from personal sampling and summation of historical time in each job. Uncertainty re-
garding cumulative exposure estimates as text notes no ﬁber sampling was done before
1970, exposures for each job were not well documented, representativeness of samples
described as "unknown" and estimates of cumulative exposures described as "probably
lower than actual cumulative exposures".
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Distribution of asbestos ﬁber exposure presented within Table 2 by age group and ade-
quate for analyses. Table 8 presented regression results utilizing estimated cumulative
ﬁber exposure calculated from historical exposures as continuous independent variables
predicting mean percent of predicted pulmonary function and changes in predicted pul-
monary function. Other analyses presented results across talc versus potash and textile
worker groups as exposed versus non-exposed categories without incorporation of mea-
sured or estimated cumulative exposures within models (Table 7).
Metric 6: Temporality Medium Uncertainty regarding temporality due to cross-sectional nature of study, however text
notes average duration of exposure to talc was 10.2 years. Range of employment dura-
tion not speciﬁed. Unclear number of years required for appearance of some pulmonary
function outcomes of interest.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium The relationship between pulmonary function and exposures to talc containing antho-
phyllite and tremolite ﬁbers in talc workers (n=93) versus potash miners (n=1,077) and
versus synthetic textile workers (Table 10) was examined in this cross-sectional study.
A total of n=121 workers (78% of the n=156 total miller and miner work force) partic-
ipated, however results were restricted to the n=93 males who had only worked at the
talc mine and mill under study. Participation rates were noted as similar across different
work areas. Participants and non-participants were noted to have had similar average
exposure duration in years (10.2 years for participants, 10.5 years for non-participants).
Selection process and participation rates for potash and synthetic textile comparison
group worker data not detailed.
Metric 2: Attrition Medium Talc millers and miner participants not working at the talc mine and mill under study
(n=28) were excluded, however sensitivity analyses revealed similar results when all
121 participants of the original n=156 male talc workforce were included in the anal-
yses. Comparison population consisted of n=1,077 potash mine workers and synthetic
textile workers (Table 10), however details on any exclusions involved in the creation
of the comparison populations not detailed. Missing data not detailed for talc miners or
comparison populations.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium Demographics between talc workers and potash workers noted as comparable with a
few exceptions for those with less than 15 years employment (non-smoking talc workers
were younger than potash workers, smoking talc workers smoked more than potash
workers) and for those with more than 15 years of exposure (potash non-smokers and
ex-smokers were slightly older than talc workers and smoking talc workers smoked
less daily but had more overall pack-years than potash workers). However, workers in
each population were grouped into or adjusted for categories of similar age, smoking
and duration of mining employment for stratiﬁed and regression analyses. Uncertainty
regarding potential healthy worker effects as prevalent hires comprised the available
population for study. Further uncertainty in utilizing potash workers and synthetic textile
workers as comparison groups with the potential for asbestos ﬁbers within potash mines,
as well as the potential for pulmonary function changes in workers exposed to synthetic
ﬁbers.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Personal air samples were collected from miners and millers to determine the time-
weighted average (TWA) exposure to respirable dust, free silica, and asbestos ﬁbers.
Sampling methods described in terms of sampling equipment, procedures and study site
characteristics for talc miners, with sampling equipment and procedures described for
potash miner exposures. Analytic methodology described in terms of instrumentation
(electron microscopy on a random sample) and standard (NIOSH phase contrast count-
ing technique) methods for talc miners and in terms of instrumentation (for total dust,
percent free silica, NO2, but not area total respirable particulate sampling) for potash
miners. Estimated personal exposure to respirable particulates in potash miners was cal-
culated from averaged proportions of total particulate from area sampling within each
potash mine. Cumulative exposure for talc and potash miners described as calculated
from personal sampling and summation of historical time in each job. Uncertainty re-
garding cumulative exposure estimates as text notes no ﬁber sampling was done before
1970, exposures for each job were not well documented, representativeness of samples
described as "unknown" and estimates of cumulative exposures described as "probably
lower than actual cumulative exposures".
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Distribution of asbestos ﬁber exposure presented within Table 2 by age group and ade-
quate for analyses. Table 8 presented regression results utilizing estimated cumulative
ﬁber exposure calculated from historical exposures as continuous independent variables
predicting mean percent of predicted pulmonary function and changes in predicted pul-
monary function. Other analyses presented results across talc versus potash and textile
worker groups as exposed versus non-exposed categories without incorporation of mea-
sured or estimated cumulative exposures within models (Table 7).
Metric 6: Temporality Medium Uncertainty regarding temporality due to cross-sectional nature of study, however text
notes average duration of exposure to talc was 10.2 years. Range of employment dura-
tion not speciﬁed. Unclear number of years required for appearance of some pulmonary
function outcomes of interest.

characteristics for talc miners, with sampling equipment and procedures described for
potash miner exposures. Analytic methodology described in terms of instrumentation
(electron microscopy on a random sample) and standard (NIOSH phase contrast count-
ing technique) methods for talc miners and in terms of instrumentation (for total dust,
percent free silica, NO2, but not area total respirable particulate sampling) for potash
miners. Estimated personal exposure to respirable particulates in potash miners was cal-
culated from averaged proportions of total particulate from area sampling within each
potash mine. Cumulative exposure for talc and potash miners described as calculated
from personal sampling and summation of historical time in each job. Uncertainty re-
garding cumulative exposure estimates as text notes no ﬁber sampling was done before
1970, exposures for each job were not well documented, representativeness of samples
described as "unknown" and estimates of cumulative exposures described as "probably
lower than actual cumulative exposures".
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Distribution of asbestos ﬁber exposure presented within Table 2 by age group and ade-
quate for analyses. Table 8 presented regression results utilizing estimated cumulative
ﬁber exposure calculated from historical exposures as continuous independent variables
predicting mean percent of predicted pulmonary function and changes in predicted pul-
monary function. Other analyses presented results across talc versus potash and textile
worker groups as exposed versus non-exposed categories without incorporation of mea-
sured or estimated cumulative exposures within models (Table 7).
Metric 6: Temporality Medium Uncertainty regarding temporality due to cross-sectional nature of study, however text
notes average duration of exposure to talc was 10.2 years. Range of employment dura-
tion not speciﬁed. Unclear number of years required for appearance of some pulmonary
function outcomes of interest.
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationHigh Pleural Plaques: Chest roentgenograms were examined by three "B" readers accord-
ing to the ILO U/C 1971 scheme. Each ﬁlm was read independently, and the read-
ers were blinded to the age, occupation, and smoking history of the individuals the
roentgenograms belonged to. The median value from the three readings was included
and utilized for analyses. It is important to note that authors only examined prevalence
of pleural ﬁndings, such as in Tables 3 and 4.

Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium No substantial concerns for selective reporting, although text noted blood samples col-
lected from talc workers for analyses of antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor
which do not seem to have been analyzed, however these were not included as outcomes
of interest within original study objectives.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment High Results reported as adjusted utilizing stratiﬁcation and multivariate regression. Final
multivariate analysis (Table 6) adjusted for age, height, and smoking status. Additional
analyses (Table 8) adjusted for years of employment. Study restricted to males. Distribu-
tion of covariates presented for talc and potash workers presented within Table 5.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium Data regarding potential confounders seems to have been collected within the Medical
Research Council respiratory questionnaire, however it is unclear as source for indepen-
dent variable data not detailed directly in text.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low Final analyses presented results without adjusting for co-exposures potentially relevant
to pulmonary function outcomes, such as silica.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium Study utilized stratiﬁcation and multivariate regression for analyses of cross-sectional
data for lung function outcomes. Unclear amount of asbestos exposure in comparison
group potash workers. Unclear effect of utilizing synthetic textile workers as compar-
ison group, with their potential for increased risks of ﬁber exposure-related decreased
pulmonary function.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium Number of subjects adequate and reported as n=93 male talc miners and millers com-
pared with n=1,077 potash miners. Uncertainty regarding the number of comparison
group textile workers (Table 10).
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium Statistical analyses reported as multivariate regression, however details of analyses
unclear for regression in terms of handling of missing data, consideration of outliers,
transformation of continuous variables and model assumptions.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Low Description of analysis brief with assumptions lacking.
Additional Comments: The relationship between pulmonary function (FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC% , Vmax50, Vmax75, pulmonary symptoms, pleural calciﬁcation, pneumoco-
niosis, pleural thickening) and exposures to talc containing anthophyllite and tremolite ﬁbers in talc workers (n=93) versus potash miners (n=1,077) and
synthetic textile workers (Table 10) was examined in this cross-sectional study. Results indicated increased respiratory symptoms, radiographic abnormal-
ities and decreased pulmonary function among these talc miners and millers with some ﬁndings noted as related to dose and duration of exposure.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Atmospheric ﬁbre concentrations were made during period 1968-82 by company and
were assigned codes to job ittles to reﬂect levels of probable exposure (table 2). Over
70% of readings are based on use of personal samplers. "For the period before 1968 it
would be reasonable to assume that levels were higher because of less extensive exhaust
ventilation and more direct handling of raw asbestos".
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low "Since 10=970 ﬁbre levels have generally bene low with mean levels under 1 f/ml
throughout factory. Only a few exposures over 2f/ml have been recorded and most mea-
sured concentrations have been under 0.5f/ml."
Additional Comments: Cohort study, 2167 subjects employed between 1941-1983 at asbestos cement factory in England. One death from mesothelioma (pleural in the study
cohort during the follow-up period. A death, for which the underlying cause was reported as cancer of the lung mentioned as asbestosis as an associated
condition. Metric 4 and 5 were low for both mesothelioma and other outcomes, so stopped evaluating. Mention of "small amount of amosite during four
months in 1976," but not further analyzed.Overall, information on the measurement of exposure metric (M4) to assess exposure was limited. Additionally,
the exposure levels metric (M5) information reported was limited to determine an exposure-response relationships.
??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation
Including Legacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos , to be considered as being informative for dose-response analysis, Metrics 4 and 5 would need metric ratings of Medium

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Low This study built on a case-control study referred to as the MALCS study (Rake et al.,
2009, HERO ID 733522), which included mesothelioma patients and population con-
trols. Telephone interviews of 622 mesothelioma patients and 1420 population controls
in England, Wales, and Scotland were conducted between 2001 and 2006 as part of the
MALCS study. Additionally, 420 patients with resected lung cancer born since 1940
were interviewed in the present study as controls for the mesothelioma patients as part
of the present study (Gilham et al., 2015, HERO ID 3077660), though the dates of these
interviews were not speciﬁed.Lung cancer patients were identiﬁed by "chest physicians,
lung cancer nurse specialists, and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) notiﬁcations" from
170 hospitals throughout Britain "Gilman et al., 2015, 3077660). Out of 420 lung can-
cer patients who were interviewed, 406 (96% ) provided consent for resected tissue to
be analyzed.The lung cancer patients were selected to be a control group for the analy-
sis of mesothelioma patients because "resected lung cancers provide the only adequate
national source of lung samples in people who can be identiﬁed systematically, are avail-
able for interview and have an age distribution similar to mesothelioma. Only a small
proportion of all lung cancers are caused by asbestos, so the asbestos lung burdens of
this national sample are reasonably representative of the general population except for a
few per cent with very high burdens."The analysis of lung samples in the present paper
was conducted on mesothelioma patients and lung cancer patients, but not the popula-
tion controls from the MALCS study.Whereas reasons for exclusion were reported for
the mesothelioma patients in the MALCS publication (Gilham et al., 2015, HERO ID
3077660), the present study (Gilham et al., 2015, HERO ID 3077660) did not report
detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria for lung cancer cases, and did not report the
number of lung cancer patients who were contacted but declined to be interviewed. Of
those who were interviewed, "written informed consent was obtained from 346 (77% )
patients with mesothelioma and their next of kin for postmortem samples to be analyzed
and from 406 (96% ) patients with lung cancer for analysis of resected tissue."Lifetime
excess lung cancer and SMR risks standardized to British males born in 1945 were also
determined.Thus, the paper did not report some relevant information about selection
criteria.

Metric 2: Attrition Medium The authors reported that "written informed consent was obtained from 346 (77% ) pa-
tients with mesothelioma and their next of kin for postmortem samples to be analyzed
and from 406 (96% ) patients with lung cancer for analysis of resected tissue." The use
of postmortem samples for mesothelioma patients indicates that the analyses could not
include samples from mesothelioma patients who were still alive. The use of resected
tissue for lung cancer patients implies that the lung cancer patients may have been alive
at the time of sample collection. The authors reported that samples were analyzed as
they became available, such that transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was per-
formed on 133 mesothelioma samples and 262 lung cancer samples. All of the analyzed
samples were from patients born since 1940, with the exception of 11 female mesothe-
lioma patients born between 1925-1939, who were excluded from most of the analyses.
Thus, lung samples were analyzed for 133/346 (38% ) of the mesothelioma patients and
262/406 (65% ) of the lung cancer patients for whom consent was obtained. Thus, there
was at least moderate exclusion from the analysis sample of lung cancer patients.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Low For the main analyses there was no control group for lung cancer because lung cancer
cases were included as a control group for mesothelioma cases. The paper also included
additional analyses of SMR, in which the comparison group was all British men born in
1945.The authors reported that "the lifetime risk (probability of dying by age 90) was
calculated actuarially in each lung burden category assuming current (2013) UK rates
for all other causes of death. These lifetime risks were standardized to the projected
probabilities of dying by age 90 for mesothelioma (0.86% ) and lung cancer (4.67% ) of
all British men born in 1945." SMRs in each lung burden category were determined "for
the cohort of British men whose central date of birth is the beginning of 1945, (The me-
dian date of birth of our mesothelioma cases was September 1944.)"The SMR analyses
were restricted to males, but the birth years of cases were not restricted to the one year
(1945) of birth of the comparison group. Race was not mentioned in the paper.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Lifetime occupational history was obtained from telephone interviews of 622 mesothe-
lioma patients, 1420 population controls, and 420 patients with resected lung cancer.
Then "job titles were assigned to Standard Occupational Classiﬁcation 1990 (SOC 90)
and Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation 1992 (SIC 92) codes and grouped into main job
categories" (Gilham et al., 2015, 733522). The authors reported that "subjects were as-
signed to the highest-ranking occupation they had worked in irrespective of duration".
Thus, although lifetime work history was obtained, the assignment of occupation was
based on only a portion of this history.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was
used to analyze 133 post-mortem lung tissue samples from a subset of the mesothelioma
patients and 262 resected lung tissue samples from a subset of the lung cancer patients.
The authors reported that "lung samples were anonymized and sent to the Health and
Safety Laboratory (HSL) for TEM counting of asbestos ﬁbers longer than 5 um."Lung
tissue samples were analyzed as they became available. Because tissue samples, but
not environmental samples, were analyzed, the samples were only analyzed at one time
point for each individual, but this time point is representative of cumulative asbestos
lung ﬁber burden.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range and distribution of exposure was sufﬁcient to develop an exposure-response
estimate. The asbestos ﬁber burden in lung tissue was grouped into six categories for the
analyses of SMR.
Metric 6: Temporality Low This study analyzed resected tissue from lung cancer patients. It is unclear whether all
of the resected tissue samples were from lung cancer patients who were alive or whether
some of the samples were obtained post-mortem. Regardless, the lung tissue samples
were taken after the diagnosis of lung cancer. Thus, the exposure measurement was
obtained after the outcome measurement. Therefore, the temporality of exposure and
outcome is uncertain.

paper did not specify whether the cases were conﬁrmed by histological or cytological
means, and did not specify ICD codes.

reported.

Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Low The SMR analyses were restricted to males. SMR were standardized to the population
of British males born in 1945, but the lung cancer cases were not restricted by birth year.
Race was not mentioned in the paper.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium Although the authors did not discuss whether the questionnaires used to interview par-
ticipants were validated, there is no evidence to suggest any concerns about the validity
of the method. It is unlikely that the participants would have incorrectly reported sex or
age.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low Potential co-exposures were not addressed.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The main research question addressed the association between asbestos lung burden
and mesothelioma. The main study design and methods are uninformative for lung
cancer because lung cancer cases were used as a control group for mesothelioma cases.
Thus, the main study design is not appropriate for assessing the association between
asbestos exposure and lung cancer.However, the study also assessed lifetime excess lung
cancer risk and lung cancer SMRs for asbestos ﬁber burden categories standardized to
the population of British males born in 1945, which is an appropriate statistical method
for assessing the association between asbestos exposure and lung cancer mortality.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium Although the authors did not provide an explicit discussion of power, and did not pro-
vide p-values or conﬁdence intervals for some of the results, there appears to be a suf-
ﬁcient number of lung cancer cases for analyses of SMR by asbestos ﬁber burden cate-
gory.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The analyses were described in sufﬁcient detail in the paper and in "Appendix 1: Statis-
tical Methods" (Gilham et al., 2015, 3077660).

SMRs were sufﬁciently transparent.

Metric 16: Use of Biomarker of Exposure High This study asbestos used ﬁber concentrations in lung tissue samples as a biomarker of
asbestos exposure, which has a clear relationship with target dose. Transmission elec-
tron microscopy (TEM) was used to measure this biomarker. In the lung cancer and
mesothelioma lung tissue samples assessed in this study, 75% of the counted ﬁbers were
amosite, 18% were crocidolite, 1.9% were chrysotile, 1 % were tremolite, 2 % were
anthophyllite, 0.6% were actinolite, and 1.7% were uncharacterized amphiboles. Thus,
several different ﬁber types were identiﬁed in this study because TEM can distinguish
between ﬁber types, thus determining speciﬁc biomarkers of exposure (ﬁber concentra-
tions in lung tissue) for each speciﬁc ﬁber type.
Metric 17: Effect Biomarker N/A The only biomarkers assessed were biomarkers of exposure. Biomarkers of effect were
not assessed.
Metric 18: Method Sensitivity Medium As described in Appendix 2, the analytical sensitivity for ﬁber counts was 0.01 million
ﬁbers per dry gram. Only 2.8% of all samples, and 9/262 lung cancer samples, did not
achieve this sensitivity due to low ﬁber concentrations and high amounts of other parti-
cles. The sensitivity was later increased to 0.003 mf/g by using newer equipment for a
selected subgroup of samples.
Metric 19: Biomarker Stability Low All lung tissue samples were sent to a pathology laboratory in Leeds for an initial as-
sessment and preparation and then were sent to the Health and Safety Laboratory (HSL)
for TEM analysis. Speciﬁc preparation for storage and transport was not detailed,
though it was mentioned that blocks were waxed and de-waxed. The authors did not
speciﬁcally discuss the stability of the biomarker.
Metric 20: Sample Contamination High The authors detail that "new disposable containers and ﬁltration equipment were used
for each sample to avoid cross-contamination and a process blank was run with each
batch of analyses" (Gilham et al., 2015, 3077660)
Metric 21: Method Requirements High The use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) enabled appropriate identiﬁcation
and quantiﬁcation of asbestos ﬁbers in the samples.
Metric 22: Matrix Adjustment N/A Matrix adjustment is not required for assessment of this biomarker.
Additional Comments: The main study design and methods are uninformative for lung cancer because lung cancer cases were used as a control group for mesothelioma cases.
The study also assessed lifetime excess lung cancer risk and standardized mortality ratios (SMR) for lung cancer standardized to all British men born in
1945, which may be informative, but there are several concerns about the potential usefulness of this study for assessing the association between asbestos
exposure and lung cancer. A strength is that researchers utilized transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to determine asbestos concentrations in resected
tissue samples from lung cancer patients. Concerns include insufﬁcient details reported for participant selection, outcome measurement, and participant
characteristics including age and race.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium This retrospective cohort study included employees of a Charleston, South Carolina as-
bestos packing material and asbestos textile producing plant. As described in Green et
al. 1997 (RefID 7837), eligible participants included all employees employed in textile
production for at least one month (men) or six months (women) in the plant between 01
January 1940 and 31 December 1965 who were followed up until 31 December 1975.
A total of n=3744 employees were identiﬁed, with n=874 deaths. Necropsy records
were obtained for only n=87 (10% ) of these deaths, for which pathological material was
available for only n=59. Exclusion of ﬁve asbestos workers due to major confounding
diseases of chemotherapy ﬁbrosis (n=2) and radiation ﬁbrosis (n=3) left a total of n=54
asbestos workers for analysis (Green et al, 1997, 7837). Non-asbestos control work-
ers with available necropsy data were only described as matched to asbestos workers
in terms of age of death, sex, hospital of death, and year of death. Of the n=38 initially
identiﬁed controls, n=4 controls were excluded due to sarcoidosis (n=1), radiation ﬁ-
brosis (n=1), tuberculosis (n=1), and scleroderma (n=1), leaving only n=34 matched
controls for analyses. Lung tissue suitable for mineralogical ﬁber analysis was only
available for n=39 former asbestos workers and n=31 non-exposed controls, however
authors noted no signiﬁcant differences in demographic proﬁle or exposure history be-
tween the whole cohort of asbestos workers and the subgroup with mineralogical ﬁber
data (Green et al., 1997, 7837). Due to the small number of asbestos workers with eli-
gible necropsy data (n=87, or 10% ) out of the total number of deaths (n=874) from the
original population, as well as the number of eligible non-exposed controls (n=34), it
is unclear if the exposure-outcome distribution of participants is representative of that
of the target population (Green et al., 1997, RefID 7837). Key elements of study design
are also reported for Stayner et al., 1997, RefID 3081241 and Hein et al., 2007, RefID
709498 for employees at the same asbestos plant employed at least one month between
1940 and 1975. However, follow-up for RefID 3081241 was extended up to 31 Decem-
ber 1990 and included an additional n=546 non-white men, n=1,229 white women, and
n=19 non-white women. Follow-up for RefID 709498 was extended through 2001 for a
total of 3,072 workers which included white and non-white males, white and non-white
female workers as well as additional n=29 workers previously excluded but for whom
updated demographic information was obtained.

Metric 2: Attrition Medium The text noted that for the outcome of ﬁbrosis score, slides consisting predominantly
of tumor, bronchus, lymph nodes, abscess or infarct were excluded, but the number
of excluded slides was not detailed and any additional loss to follow-up or missing
data for outcome or exposure was not detailed for RefID 7837. Loss to follow-up and
missing data for outcome or exposure was not detailed within RefID 3081241. For Re-
fID 709498, authors noted nearly 10% of the cohort was considered lost to follow-up,
mostly because of high rates of loss to follow-up among females and n=120 workers
known to be dead as of 31 December 2001 were missing cause of death information
with an additional 426 workers who died or were lost to follow-up before 1 January
1960 excluded from analyses using South Carolina referent rates because rates were not
available before 1960.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium Although a formal statistical evaluation of differences in baseline characteristics of
cases and controls was not conducted and reasons for choice of matching and potential
confounding variables were not explicitly stated within RefID 7837 and RefID 3081241,
all analyses between asbestos workers and non-exposed matched controls were adjusted
for matching variables of age at death, sex, hospital at death, and year of death for RefID
7837, and for age, sex, race and calendar time for RefID 3081241. Mortality results for
SMR analyses within RefID 709498 were not stratiﬁed for any additional covariates,
however results from Poisson analyses were adjusted for sex, race, age and calendar-
year.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Exposure was summarized by estimated cumulative asbestos exposures, reported lung
ﬁber concentrations, and asbestos bodies in RefID 7837, and by estimated cumulative
chrysotile asbestos exposures within RefID 3081241 and RefID 709498. Exposure data
was not available for each worker and exposures were estimated in RefID 7837, RefID
3081241 and RefID 709498 as detailed within Dement et al., 1983 (HERO ID 66) and
described within the main text as utilizing a job coding scheme for each worker which
used detailed job histories and 5,952 industrial hygiene plant dust sampling (conversion
factor to ﬁber exposure details provided) results from the plant under study covering the
period 1930-1975. HERO ID 66 noted that all known industrial hygiene data were col-
lected utilizing midget impingers by the company insurance carrier, the State Board of
Health, the U.S. Public Health Service, and the Company sampling program. Impinger
dust concentrations were converted to ﬁber concentrations utilizing the reported conver-
sion factors. Concurrent paired sampling was utilized to assess possible differences in
conversion factors over time. Cumulative lifetime time weighted average exposure for
each worker was described as calculated by multiplying estimates of exposure for each
job held by the time spent in each job (ﬁbers >5mm/mL3 x years in job = ﬁber-years.
Estimations of exposure included considerations for engineering controls and historical
textile production process changes. Authors within referenced HERO ID 66 noted the
potential for exposure misclassiﬁcation but asserted that it would be nondifferential as
exposures for both diseased and non-diseased individuals were calculated in the same
manner. Other than noting that controls were never employees of the one plant under
study and concentrations of mullite were statistically signiﬁcantly greater in lungs of
non-exposed controls than in asbestos workers, no assessment of "non-exposed" con-
trol occupational exposure history was noted in 7837. Total lung asbestos ﬁbers (ﬁbers
x 106/g dry lung) were also reported within 7837 and lung tissue ﬁber mineralogical
analyses was conducted according to methods within Pooley et al., 1979 (HERO ID:
3084350) utilizing transmission electron microscopy. Asbestos bodies in 7837 were
graded by independently by three pathologists utilizing light microscopy and a scale
reported by Wagner et al., 1982 (HERO ID: 3083948).
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range and distribution of estimated exposure is sufﬁcient to develop exposure-
response estimates within RefID 7837, RefID 3081241 and RefID 709498. Estimates
of lifetime cumulative, peak and average exposure medians and quartiles are detailed
within Table 2 (and within referenced HERO ID 66 Tables IV-XII by textile production
area) of Ref ID 709498. Exposure summaries within RefID 3081241 were referenced
(HERO ID 66), but reported in main text for estimated cumulative exposures in Table 1
of RefID 709498. Cumulative lifetime exposure estimates in a log scale were utilized for
regression analyses within RefID 7837, as continuous estimated cumulative exposures
within RefID 3081241 and RefID 709498.

Metric 6: Temporality Medium Eligible participants were followed up until 31 December 1975 in RefID 7837, but it is
unclear if follow-up was sufﬁcient for those who began work in the later years of study
as those hired around 1965 would have only been followed for approximately ten years
and Table 1 of main text indicates dates of death range from 1964-1975. Follow-up
for RefID 3081241 was extended through 1990, and follow-up for RefID 709498 was

Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationMedium Lung Cancer: In RefID 7837, both workers and control subjects for whom necropsy
lung tissue samples were evaluated for pulmonary ﬁbrosis were additionally classi-
ﬁed based on lung cancer status; the methods for doing so are not stated.; Asbestosis:
In RefID 7837, deaths were identiﬁed from hospital records, death certiﬁcates, and
state records. The extent of pulmonary ﬁbrosis (referred to as "pulmonary ﬁbrosis (as-
bestosis)") in necropsy samples was graded according to criteria established by a joint
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and College of Amer-
ican Pathologists (CAP) Committee. The ﬁbrosis scores for all slides from each case
were reviewed by three pathologists blinded to exposure status independently, averaged
to give an overall ﬁbrosis score, only slides with recognizable lung parenchyma were
graded and those slides with predominantly tumor, bronchus, lymph notes abscess or
infarct were excluded. Pairwise reproducibility between pathologists in RefID 7837 was
assessed and for ﬁbrosis severity was 71% for exact agreement and 98% for agreement
toone category and average pairwise reproducibility within pathologists for sever-
ity was 53% for exact agreement and 96% for agreement to one category. For RefID
3081241, deaths due to asbestosis were identiﬁed on death certiﬁcates using ICD codes.
Asbestosis deaths were identiﬁed using a multiple cause of death approach that included
a review of all death certiﬁcate ﬁelds as in Steenland et al., 1992 (HERO ID not avail-
able). A broad deﬁnition was used that included both deaths from asbestosis (ICD-9
501) and pneumoconiosis (ICD-9 505).For RefID 709498, deaths due to asbestosis were
identiﬁed using ICD codes in the National Death Index (via NDI Plus); codes used in the
deﬁnition of asbestosis are not provided but the methods are stated to be the same as in
prior studies of this cohort.

Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium There were no concerns for selective reporting as all outcomes which were outlined
within methods were also reported within the results for RefID 7837, RefID 3081241
and RefID 709498. For RefID 7837, regression equation and correlation results from
the text and Figures 2 and 3 were summarized for the relationship between estimated
cumulative lifetime exposure, concentrations of lung ﬁbers lung burden of asbestos and
lung ﬁbrosis scores for asbestos textile workers. Results for RefID 7837 pleural plaques
were only reported within text as the proportion (percentage) of pleural plaque cases in
asbestos exposed workers versus non-exposed controls.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium Final regression analyses in RefID 7837 were adjusted for age and sex for the outcome
of lung ﬁbrosis score however it is unclear if all regression analyses results included
these covariates. All analyses between asbestos workers and non-exposed matched con-
trols in RefID 7837 were adjusted for matching variables of age at death, sex, hospital
at death, and year of death. Data regarding smoking status was not available, however
authors noted smoking history from a 1964 Public Health survey of the plant seemed
similar to the general population and it was surmised that there would not be signiﬁcant
differences in smoking status between exposed workers and non-exposed controls. all
analyses were adjusted for age, sex, race and calendar time for RefID 3081241. Mortal-
ity results for SMR analyses within RefID 709498 were not stratiﬁed for any additional
covariates, however results from Poisson analyses were adjusted for sex, race, age and
calendar-year.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium While the methods in RefID 7837 utilized to obtain and validate data regarding potential
confounders were described only as obtained through computerized hospital records,
there is no indication that methods had poor validity. Methods for obtaining confounder
data within RefID 3081241 and RefID 709498 were not detailed, but assumed to be
obtained through similar hospital and national vital status records.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Medium Potential co-exposures to non-asbestos mullite, rutile and iron were considered within
analyses of ﬁbrosis (Figure 3D) in RefID 7837. Assessment of potential co-exposures in
analyses within non-exposed controls in RefID 7837 was not detailed, although authors
noted that concentrations of mullite were statistically signiﬁcantly greater in lungs of
non-exposed controls than in asbestos workers. Considerations of non-asbestos ﬁbers
within RefID 3081241 and RefID 709498 was not detailed.

Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium Multivariate linear regression was utilized for analysis of the relationship between esti-
mated occupational asbestos exposure and ﬁbrosis score in RefID 7837. Authors several
regression models in RefID 7837, including addition of a quadratic term for exposure
and exploration of a threshold effect of exposure on lung ﬁbrosis, were developed, how-
ever results were not detailed and authors noted the model was not precise enough to
determine a minimal or threshold level of exposure that would produce asbestosis. Anal-
yses within RefID 3081241 utilized Poisson regression and restricted cubic spline mod-
els, while RefID 709498 focused upon SMR, Poisson and cubic spline models.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium It is likely the number of subjects (n=54 total; n=44 male asbestos workers, n=10 fe-
male asbestos workers) was inadequate in RefID 7837 for analyses of ﬁbrosis scores
with estimated exposures in asbestos workers only, or lung ﬁber content in asbestos and
non-asbestos workers (n=39 asbestos workers and n=31 non-exposed controls), partic-
ularly within results of multivariate analyses. Authors in RefID 7837 noted the lack of
statistical power was largely due to the small number of cases with low and intermediate
levels of exposure. The number of subjects within RefID 3081241 (n=1,848) and RefID
709498 (n=3,072) was adequate.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium Details were provided for exposure assessment within HERO ID 66 for RefID 7837,

were reported, however details such as rules for transformation of continuous variables
of age, assessment of non-linearity and missing data, other than smoking status, were
not detailed. The statistical analyses for RefID 3081241 and RefID 709498 were de-
scribed including variables within the analyses.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium The description of statistical analysis was fairly detailed in RefID 7837, RefID 3081241
and RefID 709498, however model details regarding consideration of non-linear effects
within reported exploration of quadratic exposure covariates and threshold effects of
exposure on lung ﬁbrosis were reported in RefID 7837 but not in detail.
Domain 6: Other (if applicable) Considerations for Biomarker Selection and Measurement (Lakind et al. 2014)
Metric 16: Use of Biomarker of Exposure High Total lung asbestos ﬁber content in RefID 7837 was noted to have a highly signiﬁcant
correlation with estimated cumulative asbestos exposure (Figure 1 and text). Additional
analyses indicated similar correlations with speciﬁc asbestos ﬁber types within lung tis-
sue. The mean number of asbestos bodies on tissue sections in RefID 7837 was strongly
associated with lifetime cumulative exposure (P <0.01), total amphibole (P <0.01), and
total chrysotile ﬁbers (P <0.05) in the lung.

Authors also stated "The classiﬁcation of occupational exposures was based on occupa-
tional histories, and could not account for variation in the exposure that was not reﬂected
in the job titles or description of work tasks in the interviews. It is probable that there is
imprecision in the classiﬁcation of the intensity of occupational exposures, even if the
histories were obtained directly from the men rather than from surrogates."
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low Although cumulative exposure appeared to be collected for asbestos, levels of exposure
were separated into quartiles with no identiﬁcation of the distribution of cumulative dose
(see Table 3). Additionally, Table 4 shows asbestos exposure treated as a dichotomized
variable. Authors also stated it was "not feasible to calculate dose-response in terms of
ﬁbre concentrations or ﬁbre-years from the data in its present form. Dose estimations
were based on quantitative assessments of the intensity of the exposure (annual average
ﬁbre concentration) as well as the probability of exposure."
Additional Comments: Some target organs were categorized as either GI or respiratory. However, it might be worth considering them as overlapping since the authors stated they
were investigating " aetiological factors for cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract." Data were not extracted as the study was deemed uninformative in
Metric 4.
?No biomarkers were identiﬁed for this evaluation.
??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation
Including Legacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos , to be considered as being informative for dose-response analysis, Metrics 4 and 5 would need metric ratings of Medium
or High. This reference did not satisfy this requirement; therefore a data quality evaluation was not conducted.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Male participants were selected from those who worked as a mechanic, service-man,
or holster for at least six months in any of 5 bus garages in Stockholm from 1945 to
1970, resulting in 708 individuals. No other selection criteria are noted, but there are no
obvious sources or concerns for bias.
Metric 2: Attrition High Seven cohort members had died before 1952, which was outside of the range in which
mortality was investigated (1952-1986), and six had emigrated, resulting in an exclusion
of 13 from the original sample of 708, resulting in a ﬁnal sample of 695. The overall
attrition is low, so there is a limited concern for bias.
Metric 3: Comparison Group High Both cohort and case-referent analyses were used. For cohort analyses the observed
mortality was compared to that of greater Stockholm. A second set of local reference
rates was used with adjustment for occupational activity to account for healthy worker
effect. Mortality ratios (Standardized mortality ratio) were standardized for age group,
sex, and cause of death.For the case-referent analysis, controls were matched to cases if
they were born within 2 years of each other. 6 controls were matched to every one case.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Asbestos exposure was assessed via personal sampling during brake repair in bus
garages in 1987, which was then used to reconstruct earlier exposure conditions. The
study cited as a reference to the method for reconstruction is listed as "unpublished
data", but other sources were used to estimate the exposure to asbestos. The authors also
report that intensity of exposure was assessed "speciﬁc for workplace, work task, and
calendar-time period by industrial hygienists in a job-exposure matrix," (document page
348) although those methods are not described in detail.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Exposure concentrations were reported as weighted annual mean exposures and were
classiﬁed on a scale of three degrees : 0, 1 (0.08 ﬁbres/ml of air), and 2 (0.16 ﬁbres/ml
of air), which provides a low contrast. However, cumulative exposure is calculated as
indices by multiplying the exposure level by the duration in years for every work period
in the work history, resulting in an asbestos exposure score range of 0 to greater than 60.
Metric 6: Temporality High Due to the outcome being mortality, exposure always preceded the outcome. Latency
periods are sufﬁcient due to the last recruitment being hires in 1970 and the last date of
case ascertainment being in 1986.

Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationHigh Lung Cancer: The authors traced life outcomes via a computerized register of the liv-
ing population, via death and burial books of clerical parishes, and via Stockholm City
archives. Causes of death were identiﬁed from Statistics Sweden, and lung cancer cases
were identiﬁed from the Swedish Cancer Registry, and were classiﬁed by identiﬁcation
if ICD-8 code 162.1.; Other Cancer(s): The authors traced life outcomes via a computer-
ized register of the living population, via death and burial books of clerical parishes, and
via Stockholm City archives. Causes of death were identiﬁed from Statistics Sweden,
and cancer cases were identiﬁed from the Swedish Cancer Registry, and were classiﬁed
by ICD-8 codes.; Other Non-Cancer Outcomes: The authors traced life outcomes via
a computerized register of the living population, via death and burial books of clerical
parishes, and via Stockholm City archives. Causes of death were identiﬁed from Statis-
tics Sweden
Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium All key ﬁndings are reported in the paper. Standard errors and conﬁdence intervals are
included, and number of cases/controls are reported. However, they do not present sum-
mary statistics on asbestos exposure for the whole population, only by those deceased.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium SMRs were adjusted for age, and the population was entirely male. No information on
race is provided. For the case-referent analysis, cases were matched to controls based on
being born within 2 years of age.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization High Personnel records from the company records were used to obtain all covariate informa-
tion. In addition, a computerized register of the living population, death and burial books
of the clerical parishes, Stockholm City archives, Statistics Sweden, and the Swedish
Cancer Registry are also used to traced personal such as death and health outcome infor-
mation.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low The authors also measured diesel-exhaust exposure and report results according to that
exposure. However, no adjustment is made for this exposure in the analyses for asbestos.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The authors employ both a cohort study with an output of SMRs, and a case-referent
analysis with RRs as an output. Both of these are appropriate for this occupational popu-
lation and allow for a more speciﬁc analysis of lung cancer.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium Statistical power is not reported but the overall sample of 695 indiivudals is large
enough to detect an effect.

Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Low It is unclear exactly how earlier exposure conditions were calculated, and they rely on
unpublished data which would make it quite difﬁcult to reproduce.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium SMRs and logistic regression were both performed. Both of these are appropriate for the
study data and the construction of both of these models is detailed.
Additional Comments: This occupational study examined male workers in Stockholm in bus garages to estimate a potential relationship between mortality and asbestos exposure.
Exposure was calculated based on non-speciﬁed personal sampling and unclear reconstruction of past exposure, which was then organized into cumulative
indices of exposure. Mortality was examined from Stockholm and Swedish speciﬁc data sources. SMRs and RRs were calculated. No signiﬁcant results
were found for asbestos.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Measurement of exposure was not mentioned using a combination of midget impinger,
PCM, or TEM, and conversion factors were not determined.Estimates of asbestos ex-
posure were obtained from breathing zone samples conducted in 1971. Details on the
sampling method were minimal. Other time periods were not sampled, but industrial
hygienists estimated job- and department-speciﬁc . Time-weighted averages were as-
sumed to be 40% lower after 1969 compared to prior years. Cumulative exposure was
determined by adding years of exposure.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The mean exposure level among highly exposed workers was 1-3 ﬁbers/ml, that among
moderately exposed workers was >0.1-0.5 ﬁbers/ml, and that among workers exposed
to low levels was up to 0.1 ﬁbers/ml. These measurements were performed for 108
hours in 1971. The study showed a relationship between three cumulative exposure
levels and SMR/SSMR of the respiratory tract, pleura of the lung, and all sites.
Additional Comments: This study utilized an occupational cohort in Sweden to examine rates of tumor mortality and morbidity. There was some concern regarding details of
exposure characterization, and the presence of other potential chemical hazards (e.g., VCM and plasticizers). Results indicated increased risk of mortality,
which was more apparent in 10-yr latency models.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Subjects were male and female cases with diagnosed laryngeal cancer and drawn from
the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology (INHANCE) Consortium, de-
scribed as a "global collaboration established in 2004 among research groups currently
or recently conducting large molecular epidemiologic studies of head and neck cancer."
Subjects represented ﬁve INHANCE studies with occupational histories coded to the In-
ternational Standard Classiﬁcation of Occupations (ISCO)-68, representing individuals
from Western Europe, Latin America, France, and Germany. Descriptive characteris-
tics of subjects are provided in Table 1. All subjects identiﬁed as blue-collar workers.
For studies to be included in this analysis, they needed to have a recruitment protocol
for cases and controls, and structured questionnaires to capture information on demo-
graphic factors, occupational history, tumor characteristics, alcohol consumption, and
tobacco use. The authors report that most studies were hospital based. Available infor-
mation indicates a low risk of selection bias as to which groups were included in the
present analysis.The ﬁnal analytic sample consisted of 2256 laryngeal cancer cases (203
females; 2035 males) and 7857 controls (1604 females, 6263 males).
Metric 2: Attrition Medium There was moderate subject loss in the study. Participation rates across the ﬁve studies
ranged from 80% -96% and 62% -86% for cases and controls, respectively. However,
exposure and outcome data remain largely complete. Exclusion of subjects were also
adequately addressed, as 213 cases and 471 controls were excluded from the ﬁnal ana-
lytical sample due to missing data on sex, age, occupational history, tobacco smoking,
and alcohol use. There is no evidence that this missingness is a signiﬁcant source of
bias.
Metric 3: Comparison Group High Controls in the study were subject to the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as cases.
Additionally, controls were frequency-matched to cases based on factors such as age,
sex, and regional factors. However, in statistical analysis different exposure groups were
compared to each other rather than comparing cases to controls in logistic regression
analyses. Adjustment factors in those models included which study they originated
from, age, alcohol intake, and tobacco smoking. Results are also presented as stratiﬁed
by sex, thus allowing for an appropriate controlling for differences in exposure groups.
Difference in descriptive characteristics between cases and controls are also presented in
Table 1.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Assessment of measures were completed using a SYN-JEM which used empirical mod-
els using individual personal measurements of occupational exposures from European
countries and Canada. Data represented measurements taken between the 1970s and
2009. For linear mixed-effect modeling, 27,958 measurements were recorded for as-
bestos (expressed in f/ml) and represented measurements that had a job code available
and a sampling duration between 60-600 minutes. Random effects terms in modeling in-
cluded region/country and job title, while ﬁxed effects included measurement year, sam-
pling duration, and prior exposure rating that was based on a general population JEM.
Predictions provided an estimated annual mean exposure for a given job and region/
country for asbestos.According to Peters et al., 2016 (HERO ID: 3531308), asbestos
ﬁber concentrations were measured using PCM in over 95% of samples. One caveat is
that measurements conducted in Germany were predominantly (99% ) done using elec-
tron microscopy, which may make data from German participants (10% of cases and
11% of controls) somewhat biased relative to the rest of the participants. Additionally,
there is some risk for exposure misclassiﬁcation when using JEMs since all individuals
in a given job category are given the same exposure measurement.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The distribution of exposure appears to be sufﬁcient to develop an exposure-response
estimate. Cumulative exposure was calculated and stratiﬁed by diameter and length.
<50th, 50"75th, 75"90th, and >90th percentiles were used to stratify cumulative expo-
sure. Because of the small sample size for females, the median exposure in controls was
used as the "cut-point" for categories of cumulative exposure.
Metric 6: Temporality Medium The authors report that the duration of exposure ranged from less than 10 years to
greater than 30 years, with a somewhat even distribution. The study appears to establish
appropriate temporality between exposure and outcome, but it"s unclear if this applied
for all subjects. Data on time since ﬁrst exposure is not discussed; however, the study
applied "exposure lags of 10 and 20 years before diagnosis and interview to all agents
and metrics" in sensitivity analyses.

CharacterizationHigh Laryngeal Cancer: Laryngeal cancer status was ascertained in the original studies in-
cluded in this analysis using ICD-10 classiﬁcation codes: C32.0-C32.3 and C32.8-
C32.9.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High All results seem to be reported in all aspects of the report. The authors provided sufﬁ-
cient explanation for difference in methodology between male and female participants.

Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium Appropriate adjustments were made to account for potential confounding in ﬁnal anal-
yses. In Model 1, the study adjusted for participant age and study. In Model 2, they
further adjusted for tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption which are well-known
risk factors for laryngeal cancer. There is no adjustment for socioeconomic status, and it
is not explicitly clear why all covariates were chosen.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium As an occupational study, it can be assumed that covariate data was collected from per-
sonnel records.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low Co-exposures were not assessed in this study. Authors also recognized that potential
co-exposure to other carcinogenic agents can inﬂuence the precision of being able to
identify the agents of interest in the study as risk factors for laryngeal cancer.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The study design chosen was appropriate for the research question. Logistic regression
models were utilized in this case-control study.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium 2256 cases and 7857 controls were analyzed in this study. Sample sizes for female par-
ticipants tended to be smaller than males, but authors speciﬁed appropriate changes in
methodology to account for this. This included structuring percentile categories of cu-
mulative exposure based on the median exposure in controls as the cut-point and using
a continuous log-transformed pack-years variable to represent adjustment for tobacco
smoking.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium Methods and analyses were described sufﬁciently enough for reproducibility.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium Methods for calculating risk estimates are clear. The authors report the results of logistic
regression and there is no reason to suspect assumptions were not met.
Additional Comments: This study assessed the association between several carcinogenic agents (including asbestos) and the risk of laryngeal cancer. For asbestos, it should be
noted that measurements conducted in Germany were predominantly (99% ) done using electron microscopy (Peters et al., 2016 3531308). However, the
paper does not report statistically signiﬁcant results.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Exposure estimates for Wittenoom residents used intensities of 1.0 f/mL for 1943-1957
(old mill), 0.5 f/mL for 1958-1966 (new mill " mining ended), and declining values in-
terpolated to 0.01 f/mL in 1992 (see Hansen et al. 1997, HERO ID 2219991). These
values were based on measures of ﬁbers >5mm that began in 1966 using a Casella
thermal precipitator and PCM, cited as 0.5 f/mL (Armstrong et al. 1988, 3083076;
Rogers et al. 2001, 3080506). Earlier measures (1948-1966) were limited to dust col-
lected by konimeter; pre-1958 intensity was extrapolated based on estimates that the
new mill halved exposure (Hansen et al. 1997, 2219991; Rogers et al. 2002, 3080506).
Subsequent ﬁber measures were collected from personal and/or ﬁxed monitors in 1973
(median 0.22 f/mL), 1977, and 1978 using PCM counts; in 1984 and 1986 using scan-
ning electron microscopy (SEM); and in 1992 using TEM. Concerns include the limited
number, location, and quality of samples, as well as use of less precise SEM counts.
Cumulative exposure was calculated based on duration of residence, assuming 24 h
a day, 7 d a week exposure, estimated with varying degrees of error and likely differ-
ing by mesothelioma case status. Duration estimated used available data as follows:
(i) mesothelioma registry data; (ii) questionnaire responses; (iii) worker employment
dates for relatives; (iv) family member questionnaires; (v) records at hospitals, schools,
etc; and ﬁnally (vi) a value of 6 months if still unknown. Details were not provided on
the proportion estimated using methods with increasing error. Another source of error
includes the lack of information on speciﬁc locations and activities that would affect
individual exposure (having lived with and/or likely washed the clothes of an asbestos
worker were estimated). The most recent publication indicated that cumulative exposure
data was missing for about 5% of the sample (Reid et al. 2018, 6869529).
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low SMR and SIR analyses did not examine whether these rates varied over levels of expo-
sure. Lung cancer associations reported in Reid et al. 2008, 709466 used continuous
f/mL-years for cumulative exposure.

Additional Comments: These studies analyzed >5,000 individuals who had lived in Wittenoom, Australia for 1 month from 1943-1993 to evaluate associations between resi-
dential asbestos exposure and (i) mesothelioma (all studies); (ii) mortality in women and persons exposed as children (Reid et al. 2008, 709466; Reid et al.,
2012 2088306), and (iii) cancer incidence (Reid et al. 2012, 2088306). The cohort excluded asbestos workers. In the most recent study geometric mean
(IQR) cumulative exposure was 3.02 (1.4-7.70) f/mL-years in children and 2.05 (0.90-5.75) f/mL-years in adults. SMRs for residents exposed as children
were signiﬁcantly higher for all causes, all neoplasms, mesothelioma, and the nervous system in males, but not for lung cancer (Reid et al. 2012, 2088306).
Cancer SIRs for childhood exposure were signiﬁcant for mesothelioma, and for leukemia in males (Reid et al. 2012, 2088306). Among women, SMRs
but not HRs for lung cancer were signiﬁcant (Reid et al. 2008, 709466). SMRs in women were also signiﬁcant for pneumoconiosis, but there were only 2
cases. SMRs for both female childhood exposure and for women were large ( >4) and signiﬁcant for "symptoms/signed ill-deﬁned". Key concerns include
exposure measurement error, particularly prior to 1966 when mining ceased: a single value was extrapolated to the entire period as no ﬁber measures were
taken. There is potential for differential measurement error by mesothelioma case status, since much more detailed occupational and residential history
information was available for cases. In contrast, duration of residence - used to calculate exposure - was estimated from limited public records for about
half of the cohort who did not return mailed questionnaires. There was also 20% loss to follow-up. This was addressed in some of the cohort papers by
comparing different assumptions on the status of these subjects. Several SMRs/SIRs calculated using alternate assumptions were inconsistent, signiﬁcant
only with the censoring method that would tend to over-estimate effects.The measurement exposure (M4) metric is rated medium and exposure levels (M5)
metric is rated as low upon review by both set of reviewers. Also, the overall quality determination (OQD) is rated medium. Extraction has been completed
and quality control reviewed.

Including Legacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos , to be considered as being informative for dose-response analysis, Metrics 4 and 5 would need metric ratings of Medium

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Exposure was measured at a single time period (autopsy for stillbirth, birth for healthy
infants) via transmission electron microscopy (JOEL 100CX and Philips 525M). Energy
dispersive x-ray analysis was paired with selected area diffraction analyses to identify
asbestos ﬁbers. For stillbirths, ﬁber burden was measured in lung, liver, placenta, and
skeletal muscle tissue, while ﬁber burden was measured in placental tissue only from
healthy live births. Before analysis, NC pore ﬁlters were measured to identify the back-
ground levels of asbestos. Exposure was measured at a single time period but can be rea-
sonably assumed to represent fetal exposure. Samples with calculated levels <=30,000
ﬁbers/g were assigned a value of 0 for analyses.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low PRIMARY EV ALUATION STOPPED AFTER METRIC 5 WAS RATED
LOW****Only two asbestos exposure levels are used in analyses of stillbirth infants.
Analyses use the presence or absence of ﬁbers for their exposure levels. Mean ﬁber lev-
els are compared for stillbirth infants and healthy liveborn infants (report p-value for
signiﬁcant difference).
Additional Comments: This study provided vague descriptions of statistical analyses which made it difﬁcult to understand the results reported. Additionally, the study had a
small sample size with limited numbers of health live born infants and still births, limiting the likely sensitivity of analyses. The crude nature of statistical
analyses (Fisher’s test and chi-square tests) prevented the consideration of confounders, though it appeared that the demographic variables differed among
the study population. Metric 10 received an NA rating, as covariates were not included in the analyses.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Key elements of study design were reported within this retrospective cohort study of
n=1075 male asbestos workers who retired 1941-1967 with a pension from work within
U.S. asbestos manufacturing facilities and were followed for mortality outcomes dur-
ing the years 1941-1973. The retirees included those who retired normally at age 65,
those who retired before age 65 for personal reasons but lived to age 65, and those who
retired prior to age 65 due to a disability but also lived to age 65. The U.S. white male
population was used as a comparison population for standardized mortality ratio (SMR)
analyses. This study was an update to a previous study which only followed the origi-
nal cohort of this population (originally n=1,348 men) through December 31, 1969. Of
this original cohort of n=1,348 men, a total of n=273 employed only in Canada had to
be excluded as the current study deaths 1970-1973 through social security records. The
distribution of these exclusions with respect to exposure and outcomes was not detailed.
Metric 2: Attrition Medium Of the 781 deaths identiﬁed, death certiﬁcates were obtained for 749 individuals, and
authors noted exclusion of those with missing death certiﬁcates from analyses. No detail
regarding exposure or outcomes for these individuals was provided. Estimated cumula-
tive dust exposure was complete and described as calculated for each cohort member.
Metric 3: Comparison Group High Inclusion criteria and methods of participant selection were detailed. For SMR analyses,
the use of U.S. white males living at the same age and time periods was chosen as a
comparison population. This study was restricted to males.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Section 3.9.12 of the 1986 assessment describes the application of a conversion factor
based on a study in a factory making asbestos cement pipes and sheets.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Fiber concentrations for 5 different exposure groups are presented in Section 3.9.12 of
the 1986 assessment.
Metric 6: Temporality High The study presents an appropriate temporality and the interval between exposure and
outcome is appropriate considering the latency of disease. The cohort was followed for
mortality 1941-1973. The average length of employment was 25 years.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Of the total 1059 workers (including retirees) at a Shanghai suburb chrysotile product
factory founded in 1958, 824 had been exposed to asbestos; all were employed prior
to 1980 for at least 3 years. Employees were identiﬁed and information obtained from
factory records. Including retirees as well as current workers in the target population of
workers reduced the likelihood of healthy worker bias.
Metric 2: Attrition Medium Of the 824 employees 48 (5.8% ) could not be followed up "for various reasons"; the
study sample therefore included 776 workers with complete records. In addition, of
the total of 277 workers diagnosed with asbestosis, 259 cases (93.5% ) had complete
occupational histories and were included in analyses examining the dose-response re-
lationship with exposure. Despite some losses, attrition was low, with no evidence of
bias.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Low Participant characteristics were not provided for the study population; it is therefore not
possible to evaluate to what extent associations might be confounded by factors such as
age or gender. In addition, the authors noted that in the study population "[a] portion of
the workers had been exposed to asbestos before this factory was founded in the early
1950s". The percentage of workers with unquantiﬁed prior exposure was not shown,
and analyses excluding these individuals to assess their inﬂuence on results were not
included. This issue can undermine the validity of analyses aiming to compare the risk
of asbestosis across levels of exposure.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Quantitative measures of dust levels for different workplaces in the factory were col-
lected from the facility records: "[t]he dust concentration of every workplace during
the subject"s employment was retrieved from the factory"s dust monitoring records."
Protocols (e.g., personal vs area sampling, number of hours) used historically were not
described. Exposure in the facility was measured using Chinese-made membrane ﬁlters
and gravimetry, which the authors report were rates as suitable by the Asbestos Insti-
tute of Canada. Paired dust-ﬁber samples were measured for 18 location-job function
groups; 7-26 samples were collected for each of these groups. Historical gravimetry
(dust) measures were converted to ﬁber concentrations using side by side sampling and
linear regression-derived conversion factors. Sampling protocols for the paired samples
were not described, but concentrations are shown for areas and speciﬁc job functions
(e.g., braiding round rope, braiding cubic rope); this suggests some personal samples
may have been collected. The ﬁber counting method cited was PCM [AIA (1979) Ref-
erence Method for the Determination of Airborne Asbestos Fibre Concentrations at
Workplaces by Light Microscopy (Membrane Filter Method)]. Asbestos exposure for
each worker was calculated using occupational history and ﬁber concentrations esti-
mated for that period. Since details on the sampling methods are lacking, the domain has
received a medium rating.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Prevalence of asbestosis is reported cumulative exposure categorized in 8 levels, rep-
resenting a wide range of both high and low levels of exposure. The range of exposure
in the reference category was 0 to 99 f/ml-years, and thus included workers with large
disparities in exposure.
Metric 6: Temporality Medium Sequencing in this retrospective cohort was appropriate. The distribution of employment
dates was not presented, but the timing of initial exposure was described for the 101
asbestosis cases in the lowest exposure category. For 88 of these cases, exposure began
prior to 1958, i.e. 24 years prior to the end of cumulative exposure estimation in 1982.
While the proportion of the sample with adequate vs inadequate follow-up is unknown,
there is also no evidence that follow-up time was inadequate for a large proportion of the
sample.
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationMedium Asbestosis: Asbestosis was identiﬁed by the Pneumoconiosis Diagnostic Panel of
Shanghai via chest x-rays. The panel used the "original Chinese standard system". Au-
thors note that this system has been compared with the ILO system, but the evaluator
could not access the cited study. As a comparison with the ILO coding system is not
available, the domain was rated medium.

Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium Numbers of employees in each exposure group and number of diagnosed cases are re-
ported. The authors present coefﬁcients from a regression model as well as a life table
analysis. Methods used for the latter were not detailed, and the reference cited was in
Chinese. It is uncertain whether the life table analysis method used was similar to the
NIOSH Life Table Analysis System (LTAS) approach, in which estimates may be stan-
dardized for variables such as age, sex, race and calendar year.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium No covariates were included in the regression model. However, there is no evidence to
suggest important differences by case status in the distribution of variables that might
have been considered (e.g., age or smoking history). Substantial confounding is not
likely an important issue for this association; many studies report little or no confound-
ing of associations between asbestos exposure and asbestosis (e.g., Paris et al 2009,
HERO ID: 758968).
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium All variables were characterized from employment records; it is not certain whether age
adjustments were incorporated in the life table analysis.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Medium Asbestosis is explicitly linked to asbestos ﬁbers and co-exposures are not an important
concern if disease ascertainment is adequate. In addition, the study was set in a Chinese
asbestos textile and friction material manufacturing facility, a setting where important
co-exposures are unlikely.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The retrospective cohort study design was appropriate to examine the exposure-outcome
relationship in this occupational setting.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The number of participants (n=776) was adequate to detect an effect in the study popula-
tion.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium Results of the regression model are readily reproducible. Without access to the methods
reference, however, reproduction of the life table analysis might be difﬁcult.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium The authors presented results of "a linear regression model with the prevalence in logit
vs logarithm of the dose (f-y)", i.e. a logit model for asbestosis using a continuous log-
transformed asbestos exposure variable. Life table analyses were also used to analyze
the exposure-outcome association.

Additional Comments: This study examined the association between cumulative asbestos exposure and asbestosis in a Chinese factory manufacturing asbestos textile and friction
materials using chrysotile ﬁber. Participant selection, exposure measurement at the current facility, and outcome ascertainment appeared to be appropriate,
although details on sampling protocols were lacking (e.g., area vs personal samples, duration). Prior exposure to asbestos was reportedly an issue for an
unknown proportion of the sample; cumulative exposure could not be properly estimated for these individuals, as study information came solely from
factory records. The extent to which this issue undermined the validity of results cannot be determined.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low This outcome is rated Low due to the lack of PCM or TEM being used in the
study.Authors refer to a different study for all information regarding to exposure to
asbestos (Hughes et al. 1987, 3583332) That paper notes that air sampling data was col-
lected by a mix of the government, industry, and insurance companies with a midget
impinger (recorded in millions of particles per cubic foot(mppcf)). This was done from
the 1950s-1960s. Membrane ﬁlter sampling (measured in ﬁbers per milliliter) was also
noted to have been carried out starting in 1969. Authors note that because of the em-
ployment population occurring from 1940-1950, all exposure estimates were converted
into mppcf. These air sampling data in combination with job history data were used to
estimate cumulative exposure.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low SMRs for cancer do not provide results by levels of exposure. Authors only provide
categorical cumulative exposure levels for small opacities ( <25, 25-99, 100-149, and
>=150 mppcf-y) and for lung cancer ( <51, 51-85, 86-121, 122-169, and >=170 mppcf-

Additional Comments: Overall, this study is well-designed and references most methods to a previous paper (Hughes et al. 1987, 3583332).Note that the cancerous health
outcomes were not evaluated for any metrics except Metric 4 and 5 and had no data extracted because they did not have sufﬁcient exposure information to
be useful for dose-response analysis.

>=150 mppcf-y) paired with percentages of each group with normal and abnormal small
opacities.
Additional Comments: The purpose of this paper was to determine whether asbestos workers with small opacities had a higher risk of developing lung cancer, so it was not
completely focused on the relationship between asbestos exposure and pleural plaques, however the information collected for the purposes of answering
this question can be extracted to approach answering this other question. Table 1 contains a comparison between cumulative asbestos exposure groups
and percentage of the groups with >=1/0 and % 0/1 small opacities. The SMR analysis for small opacities does not compare groups by exposure
concentration.Note: QC was not completed for metrics other than metric 4 and metric 5 because the data are not amenable for dose-response modeling due
to metric 4 being rated low.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Study participants included male workers (n = 6,931) from two asbestos cement fac-
tory plants in New Orleans, LA, USA. Participants were identiﬁed by abstracting all
job records on ﬁle in the two plants in 1970. Participants included those hired after
1942 (plant 1) or 1937 (plant 2) who worked at least one month prior to 1970 and had a
valid social security number. Employees hired before these dates were excluded due to
concerns about record keeping, which introduces the potential for healthy worker bias
(n=167). While the authors do note differences between the two plant populations (age
at employment, race, and location of plant) and analyses do not include adjustments
(SMR), the results are presented separately for each plant, minimizing concerns for
bias in the results. The authors attempted to validate their employment identiﬁcation by
obtaining copies of Social Security Administration quarterly reporting forms for three
years of operation. They found that of the 1291 employees listed on those forms, 95.6%
were included in the study population. This analysis was not able to be performed on the
plant 1 participants. Overall this indicates a high level of participation, and there is no
reason to suspect that missingness would be related to exposure and outcome.
Metric 2: Attrition Medium Participants were followed through 1982 or to age 80, whichever was earlier, with only
a 4% loss to follow up rate. While information about the treatment of missing subjects
is not included, the extremely low attrition rate minimizes concerns about treatment of
these subjects introducing bias to the overall results. The authors do note that tracing
was more successful among those employed for more than year (97.7% ) compared
to other workers (95.1% ). However, this is not signiﬁcant relative to the total amount
of participants who were successfully traced. Of the participants who were able to be
traced and identiﬁed as dead (n=2,143), death certiﬁcates to conﬁrm cause of death were
obtained in 94% of cases. For the remaining 6% , causes of death were "allocated to
categories of cause of death in the same proportion as those with certiﬁcates." While this
is overall a low rate of missing outcome data an adequate way of addressing missing-
ness, there is some potential for bias of the true outcome data for the 6% without death
certiﬁcates.

Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium SMRs were reported to be adjusted for age (three categories for age at hire) and race
(black and white). However, these are only mentioned qualitatively in the text, as the
authors report "No effect of these factors was observed." The sample was limited to
only men. Rates from the Louisiana general population were used as the referent values,
which could introduce bias considering the employed population introduces the healthy
worker effect. Comparisons to the general United States population are also brieﬂy
mentioned in the Results, but are a secondary analysis.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Factory measurements of ﬁber levels were taken using midget impingers from 1952-
1969. After 1969, membrane ﬁlter sampling was conducted for the remaining samples.
Job categories were used to relate quantitative measures to person-years of exposure in
order to establish a cumulative exposure measure. Anecdotal information was used to
group different jobs. For each category of jobs, the mean of the quantitative ﬁber mea-
sures was assigned to all individuals. The authors report a conversion factor of 1.4 f/ml
= 1 mppcf. Their citation for this conversion factor is Hammad et al. 1979, HERO ID:
91), which explains their use of paired samples of dust and ﬁber concentrations. Ham-
mad et al. 1979 cites NIOSH publication HSM72-10267 for their method of counting
ﬁbers, which is speciﬁed to have been conducted using PCM.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Five levels of exposure are reported as ranges of cumulative asbestos exposure. The
levels appear to be adequate to develop exposure-response estimates.
Metric 6: Temporality High Measurement of outcomes occurred at least 20 years following the initial exposure.
Additionally, authors note that exposure measures 10-15 years prior to the outcome were
disregarded in the analyses. This follow-up period is adequate to establish temporality
and considers latency periods for cancer-related outcomes.

Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The study population size is adequate to detect an effect in the exposed population.
Some subgroups have a lower number of cases, but this does not introduce major con-
cerns about the power of the analyses.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium Authors report that mortality was compared using standardized mortality ratios and that
dose-response relationships were evaluated using weighted least squares regressions.
Enough conceptual information is reported to reproduce the analyses.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium The authors transparently report their use of SMR calculations, which does not have
speciﬁc model assumptions that would be expected to be violated in this study.
Additional Comments: This retrospective occupational cohort study examined lung cancer mortality SMRs among male workers from two asbestos cement factories. While the
study had an adequate sample size, consideration of exposure, approach to outcome ascertainment, and follow-up time, the assignment of cause of death
based on proportions of causes on available death certiﬁcates introduces potential outcome misclassiﬁcation.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Factory measurements of ﬁber levels were taken using midget impingers from 1952-
1969. After 1969, membrane ﬁlter sampling was conducted for the remaining samples.
Job categories were used to relate quantitative measures to person-years of exposure in
order to establish a cumulative exposure measure. Anecdotal information was used to
group different jobs. For each category of jobs, the mean of the quantitative ﬁber mea-
sures was assigned to all individuals. The authors report a conversion factor of 1.4 f/ml
= 1 mppcf. Their citation for this conversion factor is Hammad et al. 1979, HERO ID:
91), which explains their use of paired samples of dust and ﬁber concentrations. Ham-
mad et al. 1979 cites NIOSH publication HSM72-10267 for their method of counting
ﬁbers, which is speciﬁed to have been conducted using PCM.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low Analyses for these outcomes are only presented as "exposed vs, unexposed."
Additional Comments: These outcomes were rated "Low" for Metric 5, and thus did not meet the criteria for usefulness in dose-response analysis.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Low This study on mortality among male workers at two asbestos cement manufacturing
plants in New Orleans. Overall, there were 6931 employed for at least one month prior
to 1970, according to job records, with mortality ascertained through 1982 or age 80
(whichever came ﬁrst). However, analyses were restricted to the 5492 (79% ) employees
with>20 years since initial exposure (rationale not completely clear; see exposure). As
a result, the data analyzed represented only 477 of 886 (53.8% ) deaths at plant 1, and
874 of 1257 (69.5% ) deaths at plant 2 (Table 4 vs. Table 5). The authors did not dis-
cuss differences in causes of death among those included vs. excluded or note that the
large proportion excluded could have introduced bias. Other aspects of participant selec-
tion were good. A small number of workers employed prior to comprehensive record-
keeping dates (n=167 employed before 1942 or 1937) were also excluded; limited in-
formation on early workers meant these workers might be a "survivor population". The
sample included workers with variable hire dates (61% and 74% of workers at plants 1
and 2 respectively <1950 vs. 1950-69) and employment duration (60.8% and 60.6% at
plants 1 and 2 employed <= 1 year, 19.3% and 19.6 employed >5 years).
Metric 2: Attrition High Tracing and mortality ascertainment were high. The estimated rates of inclusion were
95.6% enrolled based on plant 2 social security information, and mortality ascertainment
>96% .
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium This study calculated SMRs based on Louisiana mortality rates (preferable to US rates
given the higher mortality in that state). Nonetheless, as noted in the occupational epi-
demiology literature (e.g., Chowdhury et al 2017 PMID: 29391741; McMichael 1976
HEROID 73484), use of general population referents to calculate SMRs often induces
a healthy worker effect bias given that the working population is healthier than the gen-
eral population. Use of internal referents (i.e. within-cohort analyses), or a comparable
occupational population, are more appropriate approaches that reduce bias.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Workers in these factories were exposed to both asbestos ﬁbers and free silica dust (see
other manuscripts on this population e.g. Weill et al 1977, HEROID 3084634; Weill et
al 1975 HEROID 2079035). Both plants used chrysotile asbestos; some plant 2 workers
were also exposed to crocidolite. The measures analyzed were total dust concentrations
from impinger air sampling, updated in this study using additional samples (reduc-
ing extrapolation based on anecdotal data), totaling 100 at plant 1 and 1664 at plant 2
from 1952 to 1969, at which point membrane ﬁlter sampling began. Cumulative expo-
sure multiplied the mean of available dust measures for each job title (area and type of
work) by duration, excluding outliers ("In calculating this mean very high measurements
found to be statistical outliers based on a lognormal distribution were ﬁrst recoded to
be equal to the highest non-outlying value"). Concern: It appears that recent exposures
(>1970) were omitted. The authors stated "In analysing risk " (20 or more years af-
ter initial exposure) each person contributed person-years to the cumulative exposure
category attained ten years previously. In this way relatively recent exposures (10-15
years previously) were disregarded in determining exposure category for each worker."
A conversion factor was provided to estimate dust mppcf measures as asbestos (f/mL)
equivalents: "Based on data collected in one of these plants, the best factor for con-
verting mppcf to f/ml will be assumed to be 1.4 f/mL = 1 mppcf." This factor was the
mean of dust-to-ﬁbers >5mm ratio derived from impinger-ﬁlter pairs operated in 20- to
60-minute intervals in ﬁve "dust zones" (Hammad et al 1979, HEROID 91). Concern:
Ratios for individual dust zones varied, ranging from 0.63 to 2.5, which led the authors
to conclude in 1979 that "no one conversion factor can be used for all areas of this type
of operation".
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium SMRs were calculated using 5 categories of employment duration that ranged from a
few months to >15 years (different values for each plant), and using 5 categories of
cumulative exposure ( <c to>= 100 mppcf).
Metric 6: Temporality Medium Exposure was estimated retrospectively, and analyses included only employees with
>20 years since ﬁrst exposure. Temporality was appropriate. However, the authors did
not adequately justify a 20-year latency or acknowledge that estimated latency time for
some outcomes are shorter.

Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationLow Other Non-Cancer Outcomes: Death certiﬁcates available for 94% of the 2143 total
deaths were coded in categories by a nosologist; ICD codes were provided with detailed
codes for malignancies and pneumoconiosis. However, other causes were categorized
in ways that limited utility. All cardiovascular mortality was combined (vs. ischemic,
cerebrovascular, pulmonary heart disease [e.g. see asbestos-CVD analyses in Harding
et al 2012 HEROID 2564917]); respiratory mortality combined infectious and non-
infectious causes (inﬂuenza, pneumonia, bronchitis, emphysema, asthma); other broad
categories were "external" (ICD codes for injuries, poisoning) and unspeciﬁed "residual
(n=190)" causes. Some misclassiﬁcation is likely: the authors stated that "deaths for
which certiﬁcates were not obtained were allocated to categories of causes of death in
the same proportion as those with certiﬁcates."
Metric 8: Reporting Bias Low The authors presented analyses stratiﬁed by exposure and employment duration cate-
gories only for all-cause mortality and selected malignancies, where they demonstrated
how SMRs varied with greater exposure. Similar analyses were not reported for other
outcomes. The authors used linear regression models to analyze dose-response trends
in SMRs only for lung cancer (i.e., selectively). Only mesothelioma was analyzed using
logistic regression and within-cohort comparisons. As noted earlier, the authors also
failed to analyze deaths that occurred fewer than 20 years since ﬁrst exposure, with no
discussion of potential bias.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium The manuscript stated "[s]tandardised mortality ratio (SMR) analyses were carried out
using a computer program written in Britain (J Peto)." The authors describe using local
county-based death rates as a reference due to small numbers for age speciﬁc, race spe-
ciﬁc and cause speciﬁc rates, suggesting that their SMR calculations incorporated these
factors. SMRs were not adjusted for smoking.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium Age and race were obtained from job records.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low Co-exposure to silica, discussed elsewhere by the authors, was not taken into account in
this manuscript. Possible prior or subsequent exposure to asbestos from other sources
was also not discussed.

Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The use of SMRs in occupational epidemiology is widely accepted in spite of concerns
regarding the use of general population mortality rates as a referent for relatively health-
ier worker populations. Adjustments have been suggested to address this limitation
including the calculation of relative SMRs as applied by Waggoner et al 2010 in the
Agricultural Health Study (PMID: 21084556): "we deﬁne the relative SMR (rSMR) as
the ratio of the cause-speciﬁc SMR to the SMR for all other causes, omitting the cause
of interest (i.e., rSMRx " SMRx/SMRnot x)" That study found an SMR of 0.61 and an
rSMR of 1.20 for all cancers. Other studies (e.g. Hwang et al 2021 PMID: 34525505)
report similarly that deriving rSMRs can provide additional insights over SMRs alone.
In addition to SMRs, a linear regression model ("an iteratively weighted least squares
regression line") was ﬁt to examine the dose-response trend between exposure category
and odds of lung cancer. Details such as conﬁrmation of age and race adjustments were
not given. A logistic regression model was also used to analyze employment duration
category and odds of mesothelioma (details lacking).
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The analyses of nearly 5500 workers included 1,351 deaths from all causes.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium Tables present both observed and expected deaths in detail, making SMR results readily
reproducible. The authors also adequately explained their application of the dust-to-ﬁber
conversion factor. However, details on the models used were lacking.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Low SMR methods were not described in detail, tables present observed and expected cell
sizes, and the text mentions considering age and race speciﬁc numbers for cause of
death.
Additional Comments: This paper analyzed mortality in a subset of workers from 2 asbestos cement factories. There were numerous concerns that undermine validity including:
selectively analying deaths that occurred >20 years after 1st exposure; analyzing primarily total dust measures and applying a summary conversion factor
of uncertain precision and validity; using a general population referent to calculate SMRs with no additional adjustments or efforts to take into account
possible effects of healthy worker effect bias. Analyses of the 10 mesotheliomas identiﬁed were not evaluated.NOTE: This study would not be evaluated
under the current guidelines. This is due to the low rating for metric 4, as no PCM or TEM was mentioned in the study or a cited source.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Asbestos exposure was deﬁned as occupational, inhalable exposure to any form of as-
bestos or asbestos-containing material. Silica exposure was deﬁned as occupational ex-
posure to respirable (aerodynamic diameter less than 5 mm) crystalline silica-containing
dusts (for example, granite). A detailed job exposure matrix (JEM) containing historical
exposure estimates was constructed for each study participant"s occupational title. Oc-
cupational titles were obtained through the Swedish Population and Housing Censuses
which were conducted every ﬁfth year and described as containing data from ques-
tionnaires and various registries. For this study, occupational titles were available from
the Population and Housing Censuses carried out in 1960, 1970, 1975, 1980 and 1990.
Methods of occupational exposure measurement assessment (PCM or TEM) and propor-
tion of occupational history with historic measurements were not detailed, however the
JEM contained exposure estimates for the time periods 1955-1964, 1965-1972, 1973-
1977, 1978-1984, and 1985-1995, as well as intensity level and probability of exposure
for asbestos and silica for each occupation. Only workers with at least 50 percent proba-
bility of being exposed according to the JEM were considered exposed, and it is unclear
to what extent this might have been responsible for the exclusion of subjects with low
exposure but similar chance for development of RA outcome due to the understanding
that single asbestos ﬁbers may cause signiﬁcant inﬂammation and subsequent disease. It
is unclear if all changes in job title were captured within the censuses conducted every
ﬁve years and utilized for this study.This metric is rated low because the study or any
cited methods source does not explicitly mention the use of PCM or TEM.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low Median estimated asbestos exposure (Table 2) was noted as 0.10 ﬁber/cm3 for men, and
0.02 ﬁber/cm3 for women. Details on the range and distribution of estimated exposure
was lacking, and analyses utilized comparisons between workers ever versus never ex-
posed to asbestos, however some analyses (Table 4) utilized considerations for number
of exposed occupations (one " ﬁve occupations) within analyses.
Additional Comments: This study examined occupational exposure to asbestos and silica with risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) within a Swedish population-based
case-control study.Results indicated male workers exposed to asbestos had higher risks of seropositive RA and seronegative RA compared with workers
classiﬁed as non-exposed, with risks highest among workers exposed to asbestos from 1970, before a national ban was introduced. The highest risk
estimates were among smoking workers for seropositive RA, regardless of whether these workers had been exposed to asbestos or not. NOTE: This study
would not be evaluated under the current guidelines because of the low rating in Metric 4.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium The authors used years of exposure in ﬁve-year categories as a proxy for cumulative
asbestos exposure. Fiber concentrations in different locations at the plant were also
measured using personal breathing zone sampling; these concentration measures were
not used to estimate exposure levels of individual participants. Sampling equipment
and methods were not detailed; the manuscript states that PCM was used to count ﬁbers
greater than 5 mm in length using the OSHA standard methods. Measures were obtained
in 1967, 1970 and 1971. Mean concentrations were shown, and varied considerably in
different areas of the plant, particularly in earlier years.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low The exposure measure used for analysis was duration of employment, in categories that
ranged from 1-4 to >15 years of employment. Duration of employment alone may im-
precisely classify cumulative exposure given the wide variation in intensity of exposures
at different locations in the plant (Table 1).
Additional Comments: This cross-sectional study described the prevalence of 5 asbestosis symptoms among 50 workers at an amosite asbestos insulation plant in East Texas.
Workers included had been employed for at least one year and were currently employed at the time of the study in 1971. The plant had been under
study by public health agencies and closed shortly after this study. Limiting the study to current workers, particularly since health risks were known,
may have induced some degree of healthy worker effect (HWE) bias in the form of employment changes among more susceptible workers. In fact, the
paper documented very high turnover among 850 workers. Based on multiple symptoms, the study identiﬁed possible asbestosis in 7 of the 18 workers
who had >=10 years of employment. In the sample as a whole, symptoms including measures of lung function tended to worsen with longer duration of
employment. However, there was an uptick in lung function among workers who remained employed for 15 years or more. Results were stratiﬁed by race,
but there were too few black workers to meaningfully assess trends. Overall, the small sample size, potential HWE, and use of employment duration alone
to classify exposure are limitations.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Asbestos exposure (10^ 6 f/g) was deﬁned by scanning electron microscopic analysis of
pulmonary tissue of cases and referents.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range and distribution of exposure (Table 2) is sufﬁcient to develop exposure-
response estimates. Multivariate logistic regression models incorporated three categories
(<1.0 x 10^ 6 f/g, 1.0-4.99 x 10^ 6 f/g, and >=5.0 x 10^ 6 f/g).
Additional Comments: Karjalainen et al., 1994 (HERO ID 3081833) was not QC evaluated for any metrics except Metric 4 and 5 as it did not have sufﬁcient exposure information
to be useful for dose-response analysis.Overall, information on the measurement of exposure metric (M4) to assess exposure was limited or rated low
(asbestos exposure was deﬁned by SEM analysis of lung tissue of cases and referents). The exposure levels metric (M5) information reported was adequate
to determine exposure-response relationships.
??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation
Including Legacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos , to be considered as being informative for dose-response analysis, Metrics 4 and 5 would need metric ratings of Medium
or High. This reference did not satisfy this requirement; therefore a data quality evaluation was not conducted.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Occupational exposure was classiﬁed according to four groups: Probable exposure, pos-
sible exposure, unlikely exposure, and unknown exposure. Individuals were grouped
according to the last occupation indicated on the necropsy records. The Nordic Classiﬁ-
cation of Occupations was used to code the probability of exposure. One important note
pertains to the unknown exposure group, because this was for individuals who did not
have information on occupation and may have been listed as "retired." The researchers
also collected lung tissue samples so that they could conduct a ﬁber analysis with an
electron microscope. The procedure had an analytical sensitivity of 0.07 million ﬁbers
per gram (f/g). The authors did not specify the use of PCM or TEM and mentioned de-
tecting chrysotile ﬁbes with scanning electron microscopy.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium This metric is rated as medium because in Table 2, the authors present three levels of
exposure based on the concentration of asbestos ﬁbers found in lung tissue samples.
These levels are reported in million f/g, and include: <0.1, 0.1-0.99, and >1.0.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium The number of asbestos particles in the lung were assessed using PCM.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low The study only reports the number of asbestos particle using categories of exposure (i.e.,
1,000 - 4,999; 5,000 - 9,999) using a bar graph. The distribution information is limited.
Additional Comments: Note added 1/5/23 by Nathan Lothrop (ICF) - this study was reviewed and initially was part of a cohort, but upon further review determined it was not. In
process, it was noticed authors did a basic descriptive analysis of asbestosis.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Five gram samples of lung tissue were collected and lysed from the autopsied individ-
uals. Light microscopy was used to determine the number of asbestos bodies present in
the prepared samples. An occupational history was collected for the 71 cases with >500
asbestos bodies in their samples, but there were no quantitative measurements provided
for those locations.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium This metric was rated as "medium" because they displayed three different ranges of ex-
posure based on the type of plaque found by the x-ray readers. For plaques of type IIIB,
there were 960 +/- 104 asbestos bodies, for type IV there were 32,560 +/- 31,346, and
for type V there were 42,841 +/- 10,981. This information is also presented in Figure 3.
Additional Comments: This study focused on the relationship between the asbestos bodies in lung samples and pleural plaques. They did not provide any discussions of con-
founders that may be present in this study, and there was mention that this study cannot examine the relationship between time since ﬁrst exposure and
pleural plaques/asbestos bodies because of a lack of asbestos exposure history for some participants. They did provide information on the range of asbestos
bodies found in the various groupings of pleural plaque determinations, but they had a wide variance within the groups. There are some qualitative state-
ments made in this study, such as "the cases with clear pleural plaques on chest x-ray ﬁlm had many more asbestos bodies than unclear cases" (Kishimoto
et al., 1989).

Metric 1: Participant Selection High Key elements of study design are reported for Knox et al., 1968 (HERO ID 000115)
and Berry et al., 1979 (HERO ID 00046). Knox et al., 1968 included men and women
employed in scheduled areas (deﬁned as parts of the factory to which 1931 regulations
which controlled asbestos dust exposure for the asbestos industry were applied by 1933)
for more than 20 years at any time since the asbestos textile factory opened in Eng-
land. Men and women who were employed for more than 10 years were also included
if they were ﬁrst employed on or after January 1, 1933. A total of n=878 workers were
available for this study with follow-up over 50 years from 1916 through the end of June
1966. Table 1 detailed the numbers of men (Groups 1-4) and women (Group 5 only)
within categories of period of exposure (Groups 1-3: 20 males with or more years of
exposure; Group 4: men with 10-19 years exposure; Group 5: women with 10 or more
years of exposure) in scheduled areas and duration of exposure before 1933. Berry et
al., 1979 included n=379 men who had worked at the same asbestos textile factory in
England for at least 10 years and extended follow-up for 6.5 years beyond that of Knox
et al., 1968. Exclusions within Berry et al., 1979 were made for n=12 men who had also
worked at a subsidiary asbestos factory for several years where the asbestos dust con-
centrations were unknown, as well as n=1 worker for whom a job history could not be
constructed, leaving the n=379 men for the ﬁnal analysis.

Metric 2: Attrition Medium Outcome and exposure data were relatively complete for Knox et al., 1968 and Berry et
al., 1979. For Knox et al., Other than one man and one woman who could not be traced,
all other subjects were described as successfully traced. Death certiﬁcates were obtained
for all deaths but one, described as occurring abroad. Authors noted that three instances
of lung cancer were discovered post mortem that were not mentioned on death certiﬁ-
cates and these deaths were not attributed to lung cancer. Asbestos dust quantitative
sampling data was not available prior to 1951, and quantitative measures of asbestos
ﬁber counts were not available until 1961 (Table I). Missing covariate information was
not detailed, although authors noted follow-up was facilitated by the restriction of the
main study to workers with more than 20 years exposure who would have been provided
pensions and thus were still in company personnel ﬁles. Berry et al., 1979 extended the
Knox et al., 1968 study to include n=89 men who had completed 10 years of service
between 30 June 1966 and 31 December 1972, as well as men who had left the factory
after 30 June 1966. Authors in Berry et al., 1979 noted 93% of the men in the study had
been medically examined or had a chest radiograph since 1969 or within three years of
death as the men working in scheduled occupations have periodic medical examinations
by a Pneumoconiosis Medical Panel under the Prescribed Diseases Regulations of the
National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act of 1946 and workers were given chest ra-
diographs every three years from 1951 until 1967 and every year since then. Berry et
al., 1979 noted information on asbestosis certiﬁcation was complete up to 1975 for all
men, including those who had left the factory. For Berry et al., 1979, because pulmonary
function tests were not introduced until 1967 and were carried out every two years, these
data were available for only n=311 or 82% of the men in this study.

Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium Inclusion criteria and methods of subject selection were reported for Knox et al., 1968
(HERO ID 000115) and Berry et al., 1979 (HERO ID 00046). For Knox et al., 1968, re-
sults were reported as observed and expected deaths for each outcome category, facilitat-
ing the calculation of Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMRs). Results in Table III were
reported stratiﬁed by designated Groups (1-5), which would have controlled for sex as
all Groups 1-4 were men only and Group 5 was only women, but were not stratiﬁed by
age. Additional analyses within subsequent tables IV , V and VI were standardized for,
or stratiﬁed by, age, but only Table IV was standardized by age and stratiﬁed by Groups
restricting to males and thus controlled for gender and age. Choice of reference popu-
lation was reported as the general population for expected deaths within Table III, and
as the internal worker population for expected deaths within Tables IV , V and VI. There
is potential and evidence for the Healthy Worker Effect (HWE) within results where
the ratio of observed total deaths versus expected deaths was <=1.0, including results
in Table III within some designated exposure period Group strata for cancer of the lung
or pleura, other neoplasms, disease of the respiratory system, all other causes, and all
causes. Substantial potential for the HWE is noted for the Table III results for cancer
outcomes where ratios of reported observed versus expected deaths would be <=1.0
as the general population was used as the referent for expected deaths in Table III and
smoking was not controlled for. Additional potential for HWE may be noted for Table
IV with an internal worker population was used as the referent for non-cancer outcomes
with lower observed versus expected deaths within some exposure group strata. Berry
et al., 1979 inclusion criteria and participation were reported. Differences in baseline
characteristics within the population were considered as potential confounding variables
in regression models–pulmonary function indices and cumulative asbestos exposure re-
gression models in Table 5 included age and height, but not smoking, and were restricted
to males ﬁrst employed after 1950. The relationship between percentage developing
crepitations, possible asbestosis and certiﬁed asbestosis for men ﬁrst employed after
1950 presented in Figure 4 of Berry et al., 1979 were described as obtained by life table
methods.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium For Knox et al., 1968 quantitative measures of asbestos ﬁber levels were available only
after 1961, and dust sampling results were only available after 1951, however work-
ers were followed up for outcomes beginning in 1916. Table I reports average expo-
sure sampling results from routine dust (particles per c.c.; 1952, 1960) sampling using
the Casella Thermal Precipitator with analysis at a magniﬁcation of x 1,000, and ﬁber
(ﬁbers per c.c.; 1961, 1966) sampling using the Long Running Thermal Precipitator
(magniﬁcation of x 500 with ﬁbers 5-100 microns long and whose length was between
5 and 100 microns) or Cellulose Membrane sampler. Although Phase Contrast Mi-
croscopy (PCM) was not speciﬁed, the magniﬁcations detailed indicate compatibility
with this standard. Authors noted substantial changes in asbestos dust levels following
introduction of asbestos industry control standards in 1931. Cumulative exposure to
asbestos in Berry et al., 1979 for analyses restricted to men employed after 1950 was
described as estimated from quantitative asbestos ﬁber sampling conducted beginning
in 1961, with the counts for 1951-1955 taken as those of 1961 multiplied by the ratio of
1952 to 1960 thermal precipitator measurements, and the counts for 1956-1960 assumed
as the same as 1961-1965 as there were no dust measurements prior to 1950.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range and distribution of exposure (Table I in both Knox et al., 1968 and Berry et
al., 1979) is sufﬁcient to develop exposure-response estimates. Mortality was analyzed
as observed and expected deaths, but was stratiﬁed for periods of exposure in Knox et
al., 1968.
Metric 6: Temporality High The study establishes temporality by inclusion of workers with more than 20 (and more
than 10 years in Berry et al., 1979 and some analyses in Knox et al., 1968) years of
exposure and presentation of results (Table VI in Knox et al., 1968) stratiﬁed across
categories of years after completing twenty years of employment.

Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium There were no concerns in Knox et al., 1968 or Berry et al., 1979 for selective reporting
as all outcomes which were outlined within methods were also reported within the re-
sults. Observed and expected deaths were reported in tables as single values, rather than
ratios or SMRs for Knox et al., 1968, and regression results were reported as coefﬁcients
(standard errors) for pulmonary function in Berry et al., 1979.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium Final results for Knox et al., 1968 were reported in tables of observed and expected
deaths with no adjustments for sex, however results in Table III were stratiﬁed by des-
ignated exposure Group, which was males only for Groups 1-4 and females only for
Group 5. Additional tables IV , V and VI reported results standardized for age, period
of exposure Group, and time since completing 20 years exposure. Smoking status, es-
pecially for the lung cancer analyses with the general population as referent in Table
III, was not considered. Berry et al., 1979 pulmonary function indices and cumula-
tive asbestos exposure regression models in Table 5 included age and height, and were
restricted to males ﬁrst employed after 1950. The relationship between percentage de-
veloping crepitations, possible asbestosis and certiﬁed asbestosis for men ﬁrst employed
after 1950 presented in Figure 4 of Berry et al., 1979 were described as only as obtained
by life table methods.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium Covariates were described as assessed using data from personnel ﬁles, with no method
of validation for both Knox et al., 1968 and Berry et al., 1979.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Medium The members of the Knox et al., 1968 and Berry et al., 1979 cohorts for the main anal-
yses were workers with at least 20 years (10 years for Berry et al., 1979) of exposure at
an asbestos textile plant with no evidence of an unbalanced provision of co-exposures
among exposure groups.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The study design in Knox et al., 1968 was appropriate as a preliminary step to address
research questions on outcomes of interest. Results were reported as observed and ex-
pected deaths across gender and exposure period strata. Berry et al., 1979 included
n=379 men who had worked at the same asbestos textile factory in England for at least
10 years, with follow-up extended and analyses conducted utilizing multivariate regres-
sion and life table methods.

Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium A total of n=878 workers were available for the Knox et al., 1968 study of observed
mortality with follow-up over 50 years from 1916 through the end of June 1966. A total
of n=379 men were utilized for the ﬁnal analyses within Berry et al., 1979.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The methods utilized to estimate summarized exposures, as well as statistical analyses,
were described in a way that would facilitate general reproducibility in Knox et al., 1968
and Berry et al., 1979.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium N/A. for Knox et al., 1968. Medium for Berry et al., 1979 where methods utilized to
estimate regression coefﬁcients were generally adequately described, although proce-
dures for outliers and missing data were not detailed. Multiple sensitivity models were
produced within Berry et al., 1979.
Additional Comments: These retrospective cohort studies investigated mortality from lung cancer and other causes (Knox et al., 1968) as well as pulmonary function and asbestosis
(Berry et al., 1979) in workers with at least 10 years of work in an asbestos textile factory in England. Results in Knox et al., 1968 indicated highly signiﬁcant
increased mortality when compared with the general population for lung cancer, respiratory diseases and circulatory diseases associated with asbestosis
for men exposed for 10 or more years before 1933, but decreased mortality for those working greater than twenty years since 1933 for diseases of the
circulatory and respiratory system, and no change in mortality with the internal worker population as comparison for any cause of death for workers with
20 years of work. Results in Berry et al., 1979 indicated forced expiratory volume (FEV) and forced vital capacity (FVC), but not total lung capacity (TLC),
declined signiﬁcantly with cumulative asbestos exposure for men ﬁrst employed after 1950, and the relationship between exposure and 1% prevalence of
crepitations, possible asbestosis and certiﬁed asbestosis were detailed.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Asbestos exposure was estimated, and no quantitative measurements were taken. The
authors reported that the exposure estimates were calculated "based on total months
of residency (duration) and addresses in the study area and using results of modeled
ambient asbestos concentration levels during three different time periods during plant
operations (1938-1989)."
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range of exposure was adequate to create an exposure-response estimate. The
study’s analyses included 3 exposed groups ( <50th percentile, 50th - 75th percentile,
and>75th percentile).
Additional Comments: METRIC 4 IS RATED AS LOW. EV ALUATION FOR THIS STUDY WAS ALREADY IN PROGRESS, BUT AFTER LEARNING OF NEW GUIDANCE
(ABOUT METRICS 4/5) ON 1.27.23, STOPPED EV ALUATIONInformation on the measurement of exposure metric (M4) to assess exposure is limited
(low rating) as no quantitative measurements were taken. However, the exposure levels metric (M5) information reported is sufﬁcient to determine
exposure-response relationships.
?No biomarkers were identiﬁed for this evaluation.
??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation
Including Legacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos , to be considered as being informative for dose-response analysis, Metrics 4 and 5 would need metric ratings of Medium

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low This metric is rated low because neither PCM nor TEM were explicitly mentioned as
a method for ﬁber quantiﬁcation. Fiber measurements from 1970-1976 were obtained
with ﬁlter-membrane methods. This was speciﬁed as static sampling during peak instal-
lation activities in Van Cleemput et al., 2000 783706. Measurements prior to 1970 were
estimated using a formula that assumed dust concentrations followed a logistic decay,
but no apparent use of conversion factors.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low The range and distribution of exposure was sufﬁcient to develop and exposure-response
estimate. The cohort study reported up to 7 levels of exposure (number varied between
analyses), with estimates ranging from 0 to 3200 ﬁber-years. However, most analyses
have only dichotomous exposures, with the sole exception of respiratory and gastroin-
testinal cancer (table 8).
Additional Comments: QC was not completed for metrics other than Metrics 4 and 5 because the study does not have sufﬁcient exposure information to be useful for dose-response

Domain Metric Rating Comments
Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Low Larson et al., 2012 1005289 analyzed data from 336 participants in a 2000-2001 ATSDR
community screening in Libby, MT who identiﬁed themselves as having worked at
the vermiculite mine. The screening included volunteers who had lived, worked, or
played in Libby for at least 6 months prior to 1991. The sample had fewer years since
ﬁrst exposure (29 vs 48 years), lower cumulative ﬁber exposure (CFE), and more years
employed vs others in a complete registry of mine workers ( >700 deceased workers
not excluded for that comparison). Concerns: Self-selection bias is an important con-
cern since voluntary participation is potentially related to both exposure and health
status. Along with losses due to mortality (healthy worker survivor effect), morbidity
may have affected interest in or ability to participate in the screening. As the authors
noted, "workers with greater cumulative exposure may have already been diagnosed
with asbestos-related health outcomes and opted not to participate." Only 18% of the
eligible population participated in the study.
Metric 2: Attrition Low Attrition was high relative to the target sample of more than 900 workers still alive,
according to mortality studies conducted by the authors at about the same time (see
Larson et al. 2010, 711560). Sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential inﬂuence of
non-participants were not discussed. Loss to follow-up after enrollment was not an issue
as the study was cross-sectional, and 336 of 370 (91% ) of the self-selected screening
participants who reported working at mine were matched to company records.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Low This study compared workers within the cohort with higher vs. lower exposure. Self-
selection is a major concern, as noted above. For the comparison group, individuals with
lower exposure may have been more motivated to participate in the screening if they had
symptoms potentially linked to their work and had not yet been diagnosed with a related
condition.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium This metric is rated medium because the Larson et al., 2012 1005289 study mentions

Metric 6: Temporality High Sequencing was appropriate as exposure was estimated retrospectively in Larson et
al., 2012 1005289. The median (IQR) follow-up time since date of hire was 29.4
(25.6"39.3) years, which was adequate for asbestos-related radiographic changes to
occur.

ﬁed technician used American Thoracic Society guidelines and published references for
predicted values. Spirometry was deﬁned as restrictive, obstructive, mixed, and normal
based on lower limits of normal (LLN) cutoffs, with restrictive deﬁned as FEV1/FVC <
LLN. 16% had restrictive spirometry, 11% obstructive, and 4% mixed.; Pleural Plaques:
In Larson et al., 2012 1005289, posterior-anterior chest radiographs taken in accor-
dance with NIOSH guidelines were read by two primary readers using the 1980 ILO
classiﬁcation. A third reader did an independent reading in case of disagreements. The
radiographic changes were classiﬁed as the presence or absence of parenchymal abnor-
malities, localized pleural abnormalities, and diffuse pleural thickening. No information
about whether the B readers were blinded to exposure status was included.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High Results were presented for all stated aims.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment High Multivariable analyses adjusted for age. The authors also evaluated confounding by
employment before 1974 (exposure estimates prior to that time were less valid and ex-
posure was higher), smoking, sex, and BMI. Covariates ultimately included in models
were selected empirically based on changes of 10% or more in the odds ratio of the
exposure-response association with their inclusion.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium Employment records were used in this study; other studies reported some errors in
recorded smoking history (Rohs et al 2007, 709486). BMI was measured as part of
the community screening.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Medium Subsequent occupational exposure to commercial asbestos was considered in a sensitiv-

Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The number of cases was adequate for localized pleural thickening (n=117). However,
few cases had diffuse pleural thickening (n=18); parenchymal abnormalities (n=18); and
restrictive lung function (n=45) – statistical power was likely limited for these outcomes.

Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium Methods used were described clearly, and results tables included cell sizes for numbers
of cases.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium Methods were appropriate, and the authors explained their rationale for the methods they
used (e.g., splines used to increase power and examine non-linearities; 10% change-in-
estimate used to identify confounders). Model ﬁt was examined.
Additional Comments: This analysis of radiologic lung changes and spirometry-based lung function among Libby vermiculite mine workers by Larson et al., 2012 1005289 had
a long follow-up time (median 29.4 years). Self-selection bias is a major concern: a voluntary community screening was the source of study participants.
This bias may explain the weak or null associations observed despite the long follow-up. As the authors noted, the prevalence of lung changes at higher
levels of exposure was lower than expected; this would occur if more highly exposed individuals who already had lung diagnoses were not interested in
or able to participate (i.e., suggestive of bias). Overall, they authors found a high (46% ) prevalence of pleural abnormalities (n=154 or 35% localized
pleural thickening, n=18 or 5% diffuse pleural thickening, n=74 or 22% pleural calciﬁcation); 18 or 5% had parenchymal abnormalities. The prevalence of
restrictive lung function was low. Although associations were weak and largely non-signiﬁcant, the trend, particularly in spline models, was for generally
positive associations with increasing CFE. For some outcomes, however, the magnitude of association declined at the highest levels of exposure (again
consistent with self-selection bias). Despite major concerns regarding self-selection bias, the high prevalence of lung changes at relatively low exposure
observed in this study is noteworthy.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Low Larson et al., 2012 1005289 analyzed data from 336 participants in a 2000-2001 ATSDR
community screening in Libby, MT who identiﬁed themselves as having worked at
the vermiculite mine. The screening included volunteers who had lived, worked, or
played in Libby for at least 6 months prior to 1991. The sample had fewer years since
ﬁrst exposure (29 vs 48 years), lower cumulative ﬁber exposure (CFE), and more years
employed vs others in a complete registry of mine workers ( >700 deceased workers
not excluded for that comparison). Concerns: Self-selection bias is an important con-
cern since voluntary participation is potentially related to both exposure and health
status. Along with losses due to mortality (healthy worker survivor effect), morbidity
may have affected interest in or ability to participate in the screening. As the authors
noted, "workers with greater cumulative exposure may have already been diagnosed
with asbestos-related health outcomes and opted not to participate." Only 18% of the
eligible population participated in the study.
Metric 2: Attrition Low Attrition was high relative to the target sample of more than 900 workers still alive,
according to mortality studies conducted by the authors at about the same time (see
Larson et al. 2010, 711560). Sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential inﬂuence of
non-participants were not discussed. Loss to follow-up after enrollment was not an issue
as the study was cross-sectional, and 336 of 370 (91% ) of the self-selected screening
participants who reported working at mine were matched to company records.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Low This study compared workers within the cohort with higher vs. lower exposure. Self-
selection is a major concern, as noted above. For the comparison group, individuals with
lower exposure may have been more motivated to participate in the screening if they had
symptoms potentially linked to their work and had not yet been diagnosed with a related
condition.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium This metric is rated medium because the Larson et al., 2012 1005289 study mentions
the use of PCM for analysis of personal air sampling data for all areas of the vermiculite
operation. Larson et al., 2012 1005289 estimated retrospective cumulative ﬁber expo-
sure (CFE) through 1980 using the methods described in the NIOSH cohort (Armstrong
et al., 709456). Exposure after 1980 was incorporated using updated job history data
collected by ATSDR (details not provided).
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Analyses used either CFE quartiles ( <0.4, 0.4-3.5, 3.6-15.7, or >=15.7 f/cc-years) or a

clinician. A questionnaire was used to identify respiratory symptoms; the manuscript
does not state whether they adapted or used items from validated questionnaires. The
following three respiratory symptoms were analyzed: (i) dyspnea, deﬁned as shortness
of breath "when walking up a slight hill or when hurrying on level ground") = 66 or
20% ; (ii) excess cough, deﬁned as having a cough "on most days [at least 4 days of
the week]" = 49 or 15% ; and (iii) chronic bronchitis, deﬁned as both excess cough and
excess phlegm [coughing up phlegm "for at least 3 months of the year for the past 2

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Cumulative ﬁber exposure was estimated retrospectively using available historic ﬁber
measures; PCM counts were used when membrane ﬁlter measures were initiated in
1974. Earlier measures included few measures from limited areas and used instruments
such as midget impingers. Measurement error is a concern especially before 1974. Em-
ployment records were used to calculate individual exposure. Methods were detailed
elsewhere (Amandus et al 1987 PMID: 3028135).
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low Distributions of participants or the prevalence of progressive lung changes was not

(CFE) variable used in logistic regression models was not speciﬁed, and results were
not shown. However, mean CFE was shown for the full sample and for subgroups with
different types of radiographic lung changes.
Additional Comments: The association between cumulative ﬁber exposure and odds of progressive lung abnormalities was not presented as it was not statistically signiﬁcant. Con-
cerns regarding sample selectivity may have inﬂuenced this ﬁnding. Although the association between progression and ﬁber exposure was not presented,
this study provides very useful information on patterns of progression of radiographic lung changes, including the median latency time for progression to
occur.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Liddel et al. RefID 3083980: Study population included all male Thetford Mines em-
ployees born 1891-1920 who had 20+ years of employment at the facility and were aged
60+ in November 1966 (when radiographs were taken) or at termination of their last
job, if earlier (n=515).Cordier et al. RefID 3083580: Study population included male
Thetford Mines employees beginning employment between 1954-1969 with 5+ years
cumulative exposure, excluding those who works 6+ months at another asbestos factory
and/or 1+ years at another asbestos mine (n=394).Inclusion/exclusion criteria for both
studies were generally appropriate. Key elements of study population were reported in
sufﬁcient detail.
Metric 2: Attrition Medium Outcome assessment and exposure monitoring were both conducted onsite at the facility
for all active employees, so missing outcome information is not a large concern. Sub-
jects were included in both studies retroactively after both exposure and outcome status
had been measured. Exclusion criteria were adequately documented and appropriate. No
direct evidence of substantial bias by attrition.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium Comparison structure was appropriate. For both studies, all subjects were employees at
the facility. Outcome status(es) were compared across multiple quantitative exposure
level bins. Requirements for duration of employment/exposure (20+ years experience
for Liddel et al.; 5+ years cumulative exposure for Cordier et al.) may have introduced
healthy worker effect.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Liddel et al:Exposure was consistently assessed quantitatively. Asbestos ﬁbers were
using midget impingers and ﬁber/dust ratios were calculated for each main and sub-area
of the facility. Individual exposures were calculated based on job histories collected via
questionnaire by outcome-blinded researchers in 1977. Cumulative and average ﬁber
exposures were calculated using formulas from Gibbs and Lachance (1972).Cordier et
al:Exposure was consistently assessed quantitatively. Asbestos ﬁbers were measured
using midget impingers from 1958-1976 and using membrane ﬁlters from 1976 onward.
Cumulative exposures for individuals were calculated using a job matrix and Gibbs
procedure. Due to incomplete monitoring data, cumulative exposure was only calculated
for 7 job locations.Both studies note likely incompletion of exposure monitoring data.

Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Liddel et al:Number of workers in each average ﬁber concentration category are re-
ported, stratiﬁed by gross service years (Table 1). Average ﬁber concentration ranged
from<=10 f/mL to >75 f/mL.Cordier et al:Number of workers in each cumulative ex-
posure category are reported ( <30 f/cc*yr: 42 workers; 30-89 f/cc*yr: 155 workers;
>=90 f/cc*yr: 134 workers). In both studies, observed exposure ranges are adequate to
determine an exposure-response relationship.
Metric 6: Temporality Low Liddel et al:Outcomes were measured via the most recent chest radiograph for each
subject prior to 1966. Subjects were required to have 20+ years of service at the mine
before 1966 to be eligible for inclusion. Cordier et al:Timing of outcome measurement
is somewhat vague (chest radiographs were assembled beginning in 1975 and each sub-
ject’s most recent radiograph was used, but the year of measurement is not reported).
Subjects were required to have begun employment between 1954-1969 and have 5+
years of cumulative exposure at the time of outcome assessment. There is some over-
lap in exposure assessment and outcome assessment window, but because exposure
index was estimated based on year-accurate measurements, temporality could be es-
tablished.For both studies, temporality is established between exposure and outcome
but the latency window is not clear or necessarily consistent among subjects. A shorter
latency window is less concerning for the outcomes of interest (small opacities of the
lung, plural changes) than for a cancer outcome.
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationMedium Pleural Plaques: Liddel et al:Most recent radiograph for each employee prior to 1966
was read in 3 stages by an international group of 6 readers using the IUCC/Cincinnati
classiﬁcation. Films were then randomly divided into 30 equal sets and each reader read
5 sets, providing 1 reading for each ﬁlm. The 6 readers worked separately and inde-
pendently and were blinded to age, work history, and other personal details of subjects.
Readers were involved in development of classiﬁcations.Cordier et al:Annual chest ra-
diographs for asbestos mine workers in this geographic area were compiled beginning in
1975. The most recent chest radiograph for each man still working in the mine (through
1980) was used. Each radiograph was read by 5 readers according to the ILO U/C 1980
classiﬁcation. Readers were all radiologists and pulmonary physicians experienced in
reading pneumoconiosis and certiﬁed by NIOSH. Readers worked independently and
received ﬁlms in random order. Readers were blinded to occupation or exposure status
of subjects.Equipment details for chest radiographs are not reported, but reading classiﬁ-
cation materials are included and there is no direct evidence of mis-measurement.

Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium Both papers were restricted to male employees only. Liddel et al. accounted for age
by calculating cumulative and average exposure indexes standardized to "by 45 years
of age." Cordier et al. accounted for age by including it as an independent variable in
multivariate analyses. Both papers included stratiﬁed analyses by dichotomized smok-
ing. Length and timing of employment were considered through calculation of exposure
indexes. Neither paper discusses additional covariates such as race/ethnicity or SES.

Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium Both studies compared prevalence of small irregular opacities and pleural changes
across ordinal cumulative and average exposure bins. Liddel et al. used a modiﬁed least
squares analysis (X^ 2 values reported) and Cordier et al. used a multivariate analysis
that included age, smoking and exposure as independent terms (p-values discussed in
text). Both analytical approaches were generally appropriate for the subject matter, if not
overly robust.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium Sample size and observed exposure ranges are adequate to detect present relationships in
both studies.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Low Descriptions of analytical methods are lacking and could not be easily reproduced (e.g.,
type of multivariate analysis performed and comparison statistic calculated are not re-
ported in Cordier et al.).
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Low Liddel et al. used a modiﬁed least square analysis and Cordier et al., used an unidenti-
ﬁed "multivariate analysis" to characterize differences in prevalence of outcomes across
exposure groups. There is not direct evidence that these methods were inappropriate, but
full information is lacking.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low This metric is rated Low because authors in this paper do not explicitly cite use of PCM
or TEM. Authors suggest that side-by-side measurements of dust and ﬁber were made to
develop a conversion factor, but there is no detail on microscopy methods. The methods
paper cited is Gibbs and Lachance, 1972, HEROID: 3580825, but this does not clarify
ﬁber counting methods. Methods of sample collection included midget impinger dust
counts measured between 1949 and 1976 and membrane ﬁlters between 1969 and 1976.
Conversion factors were utilized but were based on other studies to convert mpcf to f-ml.
Exposure data was examined for both cases and referents and came from exposure work
histories. For measurements prior to 1949, estimates were based off of interviews from
long-service employees which could introduce recall bias.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Four levels of exposure are provided in the analyses in (f/ml)*y. Mean exposure was
828.3 (f/ml)*y.
Additional Comments: QC was not completed for metrics other than Metrics 4 and 5 because the study does not have sufﬁcient exposure information to be useful for dose-response
analysis.
?No biomarkers were identiﬁed for this evaluation.
??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low In both Lin et al., 2012 (HERO ID 3078595) and Wang et al., 2012 (HERO ID 3078782)
worker job titles or workshops are utilized as surrogates for exposure within categories
of ﬁnal SMR results (Lin et al., 2012) and Cox models (Wang et al., 2012). In Lin et
al., 2012 (HERO ID 3078595), SMR results were only presented across low, medium
and high exposure categories based on exposure measurements conducted only in 2002,
with only references to the Wang et al., 2012 (HERO ID 3078782) study. In Wang et al.,
2012, authors reference the 2002 measurements made using TEM (referencing a study
by Yano et al., 2001 with title "Longitudinal study of the mortality of lung cancer in
chrysotile workers", which does not exist and may be a misprint or has been replaced by
Yano et al., 2001, HERO ID 3080569, entitled "Cancer Mortality among Workers Ex-
posed to Amphibole-free ChrysotileAsbestos" and found in the same journal).It was not
until 2016 when Courtice et al., 2016 (HERO ID 3520560) was conducted with the spe-
ciﬁc purpose of estimating cumulative ﬁber exposures in this Chinese asbestos factory
worker cohort that exposure from historical dust measures and PCM-analyzed sampling
was combined within a formal analysis. In this study they note about the studies at hand:
"In the published studies, however, workers" job titles or workshops were used as sur-
rogates for exposure. This could have led to potential exposure misclassiﬁcation and
over- or underestimation of the associations. These studies did not consider quantitative
estimates of individual exposures, with which one can test hypotheses concerning quan-
titative exposure"response relationships. The purpose of the present study is to estimate
cumulative ﬁber exposures in this Chinese asbestos factory worker cohort and determine
the exposure"response relationships with lung cancer mortality..." (page 370).
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range and distribution of exposures summarized within Table 1 of Wang et al.,
2012 (HERO ID 3079792) was adequate to develop an exposure response estimate,
however these were summary measures for only the year 2002 for a cohort follow-up for
outcomes for 37 years. These 2002 measures were only brieﬂy summarized as median
levels within the text of in Lin et al., 2012 (HERO ID 3078595).
Additional Comments: Lin et al., 2012 (HERO ID 3078595) and Wang et al., 2012 (HERO ID 3078782) studied n=577 workers from a chrysotile asbestos textile plant in China,
1972-2008. Both Lin et al., 2012 (HERO ID 3078595) and Wang et al., 2012 (HERO ID 3078782) were not evaluated for any metrics except Metric 4 and
5 as they did not have sufﬁcient exposure information to be useful for dose-response analysis.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Lockey et al. 1984, 029685 is a retrospective cohort and cross-sectional study of 512
workers conducted in 1980 at a facility that processed Libby vermiculite contaminated
with tremolite as an inert carrier. All vermiculite-exposed employees and a group of
unexposed workers from the same plant were included (480 males, 32 females; 496
white) and stratiﬁed into three exposure groups. Group III/high exposure (n=194, 37.8%
) which included vermiculite expanders and plant maintenance workers) was older and
had longer duration of employment than the other groups. Concerns: No speciﬁc ev-
idence of bias but studying only current employees risks some HWE as susceptible
exposed individuals may have had a higher probability to transfer or leave.
Metric 2: Attrition High Of 530 workers asked to participate, 512 (97% ) were included.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium The comparison group comprised workers in the cohort with lower vermiculite expo-
sure. Other exposures were similar to those among the exposed group (particularly for
chemical workers in group II). The younger age and shorter duration of work in the
comparison vs. exposed group may warrant assessment of confounding.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Retrospective cumulative ﬁber exposure (CFE) was characterized using detailed job
histories and available ﬁber counts. Membrane ﬁlter samples and PCM was used, count-
ing particles >5mm in length, <9mm in diameter, and aspect ratio of 3:1. Concerns:
(i) Exposure monitoring was initiated only in 1972; extrapolations to earlier years may
be underestimates as no data were available. Protocols were reﬁned over time: mea-
sures prior to 1976, when personal breathing zone sampling began, may be less accurate.
(ii) Lack of information on extensive overtime worked may underestimate and/or mis-
classify exposures assigned to individuals. In addition, speciﬁc ﬁber types were not
characterized at that time.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Three exposure groups were compared, either as CFE ( <1, 1-10 and >10 ﬁbers/mL-
year) or based on work groups (I, II and III). Mean exposure in these groups further
stratiﬁed by smoking ranged from 0.35 to 7.55 ﬁbers/mL-year.
Metric 6: Temporality Medium Sequencing was appropriate. However, mean follow-up (6.6 to 13.3 years by work type
and smoking groups) was below the 20+ years estimated for some asbestos-associated
lung changes to occur. Only 48 employees were employed for 20 years.

capacity. Assessed by trained staff using ATS criteria and published reference. Mea-
sures were repeated if participants had a respiratory infection in the previous 3 weeks or
had smoked in the past hour.; Pleural Plaques: Radiographic lung changes (observed in
n=22): Chest radiographs were evaluated by two board-certiﬁed readers with no knowl-
edge of exposure using modiﬁed 1971 ILO criteria. A third reader resolved any lack of
consensus, and x-rays were retaken if necessary. Costophrenic angle blunting included
separately vs combined with diffuse pleural thickening as in later studies.; Other Non-
Cancer Outcomes: (1) Dyspnea: The American Thoracic Society (ATS) questionnaire
was modiﬁed to ask about pleuritic chest pain (reporting an evaluation by physician). (2)
Rales and nail clubbing: A physical exam including breath measures in 4 locations was
conducted.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium The study presented results for all aims and frequently showed details such as numbers
of cases and non-cases by exposure category. However, some results were presented
only in ﬁgures without population numbers.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium Most associations were presented as unadjusted descriptive data, but confounding was
also considered. To address confounding, Lockey et al 029685: (i) provided an age-
matched case-control comparison of mean CFE for lung change outcomes; (ii) showed
pleuritic chest pain prevalence stratiﬁed by smoking history as well as asbestos expo-
sure; and (iii) reported results of discriminant analysis accounting for age and smoking
for some associations.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium Questionnaires and employment records were used.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Medium Lockey et al, RefID 029685 reported that a "careful review of all chemical and physi-
cal agents "did not identify any co-exposures at the plant that would be associated with
pleural radiographic changes. They also reported that "the study and control popula-
tions were evenly matched for exposure history except for the presence or absence of
exposure to vermiculite".
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium Appropriate analyses were used for all studies. Lockey et al, RefID 029685 used dis-
criminant analysis for categorical analysis of covariance for continuous measures. The
statistical signiﬁcance of differences in exposure for age-matched case-control pairs
was also evaluated using alternative tests given that the N was small (paired t-tests and
non-parametric Wilcoxon rank tests applied).

Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The overall N (512) was adequate, but power was limited because the prevalence of lung
radiographic changes was low in this ﬁrst study, in which duration since ﬁrst exposure
was short. Only 2.2% of the sample had signiﬁcant pleural or parenchymal changes, and
2.2% had costophrenic blunting only.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The analyses presented are reproducible, sufﬁcient detail was provided.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium The authors explained the rationale for the statistical methods used (discriminant anal-
ysis, ANCOV A, age-matched case-control comparisons) and for the covariates exam-
ined (age, smoking). Non-parametric tests were used when Ns were small. It is unclear
whether they examined whether transformations to improve linearity or reduce skewness
of the cumulative ﬁber exposure variable would have better met model assumptions.
Additional Comments: This 1980 cohort begins a series of studies on 501 workers from facility that had been processing asbestos-contaminated vermiculite since 1957. The low
level of asbestos exposure at the plant was associated with radiographic lung changes, dyspnea, and pleuritic chest pain, but not lung function, rales, or
ﬁnger clubbing. The 8h time-weighted average exposure among the most exposed workers was 1.5 ﬁbers/mL through 1973 and thereafter 0.375 ﬁbers/mL.
Cumulative ﬁber exposure (CFE) was >10 ﬁbers/mL-years in 9.6% of workers; 10.7% had a 20+-year work duration. Only 22 (4.4% ) workers had
radiographic lung changes at this time point: prevalence was 2.8% , 3.9% and 5.8% in the low, medium, and high exposure groups. Concerns: (1) Enrolling
only current workers limited employment duration and time since ﬁrst exposure. HWE is possible if susceptible employees were more likely to change
jobs over time. Indeed, only 4 of the 7 workers with previously documented benign pleural effusions were enrolled in this study. (2) Misclassiﬁcation of
historic ﬁber exposure is likely as exposure measurement began only in 1972 and no information on considerable overtime hours was included.Note: Libby
ore was later found to contain winchite and richterite along with tremolite.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium The study included pooled data from cohorts of people who were employed at any
of four textile mills in North Carolina (from 1950 - 1973) and South Carolina (from
1940-1965). This pooled study population included 3717 men and 2419 women. To
be included in this study, participants needed to have worked at least 30 days in textile
production departments. Recruitment methods are described in previous publications.
Additional demographic information such as race, gender, and duration of employment
is provided in Elliott et al. 2012 HERO ID: 1247861 (Table 1). Available information
does not indicate substantial risk of selection bias.
Metric 2: Attrition High Elliott et al. 2012 HERO ID: 1247861 stated that loss to follow-up was approximately
7% and that 5% of deaths had an undetermined cause, but this proportion of subjects
would not have signiﬁcantly biased the exposure-outcome relationship.
Metric 3: Comparison Group High All participants were textile workers from North Carolina and South Carolina who were
included based on the same participant selection criteria. Differences in demographic
characteristics were considered as potential confounders and were adjusted for in statis-
tical models.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium TEM was used to estimate the distributions of ﬁbers for combinations of plant and de-
partment in categories deﬁned by diameter and length, using a stratiﬁed random sample
of historical dust samples collected from the study plants. The samples were collected
from 1964-1971, which is only a small portion of the exposure period. The authors ac-
knowledge this limitation but note that methods of operation did not change during the
study period. Poisson regression modelling was used to estimate adjustment factors for
each length-diameter category, which were applied to a matrix of "ﬁber concentrations
estimated by the standard PCM method to generate ﬁber size-speciﬁc estimates of ex-
posure". Estimated exposures to ﬁbers were linked to occupational histories to assign
individual cumulative exposure in ﬁber-years/ml.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range and distribution of exposure appear to be sufﬁcient to develop an exposure-
response estimate. The distribution of ﬁbers was classiﬁed into four diameter-based
categories and six length-based categories. Cumulative exposure was estimated as a
continuous variable.

Metric 6: Temporality High The exposure precedes the outcome of lung cancer mortality. Participants were followed
for vital status until December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2003 for South Carolina and
North Carolina workers, respectively. These dates provide more than 15 years of follow-
up after the employment end dates of 1973 and 1965, respectively. However, individuals
who died of other causes might not have survived long enough to develop lung cancer.

ate causes and other signiﬁcant conditions, were coded to the International Classiﬁcation
of Diseases in effect at the time of the death."

Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment High Appropriate adjustments were made to account for potential confounding in the analy-
ses. Models adjusted for age, sex, race, and calendar time.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization High Elliott et al. 2012 1247861 stated that occupational histories stemmed from "several
sources, including employers" personnel records, records microﬁlmed by the USA
Public Health Service during the 1960s and records of a state occupational health pro-
gramme." Thus, it is likely that covariate data were obtained from these valid sources.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Medium Although co-exposures were not directly assessed in this study, the authors stated that
any variation in the strength of the association between asbestos ﬁber exposure and lung
cancer mortality is unlikely to be attributed to co-exposures. The authors stated that
mineral oils used for dust control were the only notable co-exposure, but that previous
studies indicated that mineral oil exposure was not a confounder of the association be-
tween asbestos and lung cancer.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The study design chosen was appropriate for the research question. Poisson regression
models were utilized in this cohort study.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The sample size was large enough to detect an association. Statistically signiﬁcant re-
sults were found.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium Methods and analyses were described sufﬁciently to be reproducible.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium Methods for calculating risk estimates are clear and model assumptions appear to be

Additional Comments: The main ﬁber type in this study is chrysotile, but one plant processed limited amounts of amosite between 1973-1976 and one plant used limited amounts
of crocidolite from the 1950s - 1975. This study assessed cohorts from North Carolina and South Carolina that have been assessed in previous publications.
This study assessed the association between ﬁber dimensions (diameter and length) and lung cancer mortality. The study found that cumulative exposures
to total ﬁbers and to ﬁbers in every length and diameter category were signiﬁcantly associated with lung cancer mortality, and the association was stronger
for long and thin ﬁbers. The exposure estimation methods are the main limitation of the study, including that the TEM-based exposure estimates were
based on historical sampling that had occurred only for a small portion of the study period.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection High This paper was evaluated for mesothelioma as part of the North Carolina cohort in the
Asbestos Part 1 risk evaluation. The criteria for High are met for pleural cancer, because
as described in Asbestos Part 1 "Setting and methods of case ascertainment were re-
ported in (Loomis et al., 2009), p. 535-536. Participant selection and inclusion/exclusion
criteria varied by study and analysis. Although there were 4 plants in the cohort, expo-
sure data were available only for three of the four, so exposure-response analyses were
limited to these three plants. Original selection criteria reported in (Loomis et al., 2009)
p 536 (participants had to work at least 1 day between 1950 and 1973) and p 539 (par-
ticipants excluded due to missing data). (Elliott et al., 2012) evaluated a subset of the
cohort that worked >30 days during the same time frame. b. Selection in or out of the
study was based on 1) employment in production job during designated time frame and
b) availability of necessary data (birth and hire dates; work history; vital status). These
criteria are unlikely to result in biased subject participation."
Metric 2: Attrition Medium This paper was evaluated for mesothelioma as part of the North Carolina cohort in the
Asbestos Part 1 risk evaluation. The criteria for Medium are met for pleural cancer, be-
cause as described in Asbestos Part 1 "Attrition/missing data exclusions were reported
in ((SRC, 2019a) p. 1), ((Loomis et al., 2009) p. 539) and (Elliott et al., 2012) pg 386.
The original cohort was 5770 persons; 373 workers at plant 2 were excluded due to lack
of exposure data at this plant, 1596 were excluded due to incomplete work histories (at
department level) or non-production jobs ((Loomis et al., 2009) p. 539). Final cohort
for exposure-response analyses was 3803. Vital status was unknown for 241 of the 3803
(6% ) cohort members (suggesting moderate loss to follow up). The subgroup evalu-
ated in (Elliott et al., 2012) consisted of 3082 subjects (excluded persons who worked
<30 days); the proportion for whom vital status was missing was not reported for the
subgroup."
Metric 3: Comparison Group High This paper was evaluated for mesothelioma as part of the North Carolina cohort in the
Asbestos Part 1 risk evaluation and was rated as not applicable for mesothelioma. Key
elements of the study design for the North Carolina cohort study are reported in Loomis
et al., 2009, HERO ID 1257856. Men and women employed for at least one day be-
tween 1950 - 1973 in three North Carolina textile mills were included in the present
study. A fourth smaller plant that did not process raw ﬁbers was excluded from the
present study due to a lack of adequate exposure data. Differences in demographic char-
acteristics were considered as potential confounders and were adjusted for in statistical
models.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium This paper was evaluated for mesothelioma as part of the North Carolina cohort in the
Asbestos Part 1 risk evaluation. The criteria for Medium are met for pleural cancer,
because as described in Asbestos Part 1 "(SRC, 2019a) reports air concentrations and
exposure duration by interval of TSFE. Air samples were available for 3 plants cover-
ing period from 1935 to 1986 (459 <1950; 1674 from 1950-1969, and 1287 from 1970
forward; (Loomis et al., 2009), p. 536). Measurements used impinger before 1964 and
PCM thereafter; paired and concurrent samples between 1964 and 1971 were used to re-
late impinger to PCM-equivalent concentrations. Air samples were not collected yearly,
so mean PCM-equivalent concentrations were estimated by plant, department, job, and
time period using multivariate mixed models ((Loomis et al., 2009), p. 536). Individual
cumulative exposure assessed using the modeled concentrations and JEM ((Loomis et
al., 2009) p 536); details of JEM reported in (Dement et al., 2008)."
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium This paper was evaluated for mesothelioma as part of the North Carolina cohort in the
Asbestos Part 1 risk evaluation. The criteria for Medium are met for pleural cancer,
because as described in Asbestos Part 1 "(SRC, 2019a) reports air concentrations and
exposure durations by interval of TSFE." The authors of the present study note that
the study includes "extensive individual exposure estimates, which facilitate a range of
exposure-response analyses."
Metric 6: Temporality High This paper was evaluated for mesothelioma as part of the North Carolina cohort in the
Asbestos Part 1 risk evaluation. The criteria for High are met for pleural cancer, be-
cause as described in Asbestos Part 1 "Temporality was established (exposure preceded
death). (SRC, 2019a) reports cases by interval of TSFE ranging up to 72 years since ﬁrst
exposure."

Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationHigh Other Cancer(s): This paper was evaluated for mesothelioma as part of the North Car-
olina cohort in the Asbestos Part 1 risk evaluation, and was rated as High for mesothe-
lioma with a note that the "High rating applies to cases assessed with ICD10. For some
analyses, the authors pooled these cases with cases coded to cancer of the pleura in ICDs
6-9, which is not considered a reliable measure of mesothelioma outcome. (SRC, 2019a)
reports cases assessed with ICD10 by interval of TSFE". As described in the present
study, vital status of the cohort was ascertained using searches of the National Death
Index (NDI) and other sources. Cause of death information was coded to the 9th or 10th
revision of the ICD for information obtained from NDI-plus and to the ICD in force at
the time of death for deaths before 1979. This paper "ﬁt models for the outcome of pleu-
ral cancer combined with mesothelioma (including deaths coded as either mesothelioma
or cancer of the pleura), as well as for the outcome of mesothelioma (including only
deaths with ICD"10 codes for mesothelioma) in the subcohort of workers who survived
until at least 1999". Thus, the present study includes proper consideration of the coding
for pleural cancer and mesothelioma.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High This paper was evaluated for mesothelioma as part of the North Carolina cohort in the
Asbestos Part 1 risk evaluation. The criteria for High are met for pleural cancer, be-
cause as described in Asbestos Part 1 "(SRC, 2019a) provides mesothelioma cases and
person-years at risk by interval of TSFE, including separate reporting of those assessed
by ICD10. Mesothelioma cases (with detail of those assessed by ICD10) reported by
employment duration in Table 4 of (Loomis et al., 2009) (2 coded cases with 5-10 years
employment and 1 coded case each with 10-20 and 20-30 years employment). SMR
with CI reported in Table 3 (Loomis et al., 2009). and in (SRC, 2019a) . (Loomis et al.,
2009) reports number in cohort, total PY of follow-up, and median duration employ-
ment. In (Elliott et al., 2012), Table 1 reports cohort characteristics including age at
entry, age at ﬁrst employment, person years at risk, cumulative exposures, for the sub-
set of workers who were employed at least 30 days (by NC plant and for the whole NC
cohort)."
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment High This paper was evaluated for mesothelioma as part of the North Carolina cohort in the
Asbestos Part 1 risk evaluation. The cohort was not rated for mesothelioma for this met-
ric.In the present study, "all models were adjusted for age at risk (continuous) and race
(white or nonwhite)". The authors reported that "adjustment for gender had little impact
on any model and was omitted from" the ﬁnal models. Thus, explicit considerations
were made for potential confounders.

Metric 10: Covariate Characterization High This paper was evaluated for mesothelioma as part of the North Carolina cohort in the
Asbestos Part 1 risk evaluation. The cohort was not rated for mesothelioma for this met-
ric.A previous paper from this cohort, Elliott et al. 2012 1247861, stated that occupa-
tional histories stemmed from "several sources, including employers" personnel records,
records microﬁlmed by the USA Public Health Service during the 1960s and records of
a state occupational health program." Thus, it is likely that covariate data were obtained
from these valid sources.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low This paper was evaluated for mesothelioma as part of the North Carolina cohort in
the Asbestos Part 1 risk evaluation. The cohort was not rated for mesothelioma for
this metric because potential co-exposure confounding is generally not a concern for
mesothelioma because there are few potential confounders of the association between
asbestos and mesothelioma. In a previous publication from this cohort (Loomis et al.
2012, HERO ID 1257856), The authors stated that mineral oils used for dust control
were the only notable co-exposure. It is unclear whether mineral oils are a potential
confounder of the association between asbestos exposure and pleural cancer. But in the
present study, potential co-exposures were not discussed.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium This paper was evaluated for mesothelioma as part of the North Carolina cohort in the
Asbestos Part 1 risk evaluation. The retrospective cohort design was appropriate to
address the research question. The present study used Poisson regression modeling to
estimate relationships between asbestos exposure and mortality from pleural cancer and
mesothelioma. Thus, the present paper used an appropriate statistical method to address
the research question.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium This paper was evaluated for mesothelioma as part of the North Carolina cohort in the
Asbestos Part 1 risk evaluation. The cohort was not rated for mesothelioma for this met-
ric. The present analyses included 5397 workers included in analysis, which is a sufﬁ-
ciently large sample size. Although pleural cancer and mesothelioma are rare outcomes,
which may have resulted in reduced precision in this study, there was sufﬁcient power to
detect an association, as evidenced by the ﬁndings of statistically signiﬁcant associations
between asbestos exposure and all pleural cancer (including mesothelioma).
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium This paper was evaluated for mesothelioma as part of the North Carolina cohort in the
Asbestos Part 1 risk evaluation. The cohort was not rated for mesothelioma for this
metric in Asbestos Part 1, but it was noted that "(SRC, 2019a) provides individual data
elements allowing independent analysis." The description of the analysis in the present
paper is sufﬁcient to understand how to conceptually reproduce the analysis with access
to the analytic data.

Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium This paper was evaluated for mesothelioma as part of the North Carolina cohort in the
Asbestos Part 1 risk evaluation. The cohort was not rated for mesothelioma for this
metric in Asbestos Part 1. The model for calculating the risk estimates in the present
paper is sufﬁciently transparent.
Additional Comments: This study assessed the outcomes of pleural cancer and mesothelioma. This study was evaluated for mesothelioma as part of the North Carolina cohort
in Asbestos Part 1. Therefore an evaluation form for the speciﬁc outcome of mesothelioma was not included in this evaluation. This evaluation is for
the broader category of pleural cancer, which includes mesothelioma. In Asbestos Part 1, this cohort was rated as High quality for mesothelioma. In
this particular study, models were ﬁt "for the outcome of pleural cancer combined with mesothelioma (including deaths coded as either mesothelioma or
cancer of the pleura), as well as for the outcome of mesothelioma (including only deaths with ICD"10 codes for mesothelioma) in the subcohort of workers
who survived until at least 1999." This study assessed associations of mesothelioma and pleural cancer with exposure duration, time since ﬁrst exposure
(TSFE) and cumulative ﬁber exposure. In addition to ﬁtting Poisson regression models, this study also evaluated a mesothelioma risk model that was
developed in the 1980s and used by the EPA and OSHA. This study has several strengths. The authors noted that the study includes "extensive individual
exposure estimates, which facilitate a range of exposure-response analyses." The main limitations noted by the authors were reduced precision due to the
small number of informative deaths, and concerns about the quality of outcome assessment for mesothelioma. The latter concern was addressed in part
by the assessment of pleural cancer together with mesothelioma, and the assessment of mesothelioma only as identiﬁed by ICD-10. Thus, this study may
provide useful dose-response information for pleural cancer and mesothelioma, though most of this information has been captured in the Asbestos Part 1
assessment of mesothelioma.

of citation of methods paper that would give details. In Magnani et al., 2020, HERO ID
7460047, authors mention optical microscopy: "The experts estimated for each plant
and year the proportion of exposed workers, the percentage of time in asbestos exposing
tasks and the minimum and maximumconcentrations of asbestos airborne ﬁbres (f/ml,
from data measured in optical microscopy), for direct and indirect exposure separately."
In addition, both studies rely heavily on expert judgment to develop exposure estimates.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low This metric is rated Low because the studies or any cited methods source do not explic-
itly mention the use of PCM or TEM. Exposure for workers was assigned by a JEM
described in F"votte et al. 2011 (HERO ID: 2571088). However, the methods there do
not descibe how the exact JEM used in the present cohort was created, and do not cite
any sources providing data on sampling or quantiﬁcation methods. The only sources
cited for details are in French and thus were not able to be evaluated by the EPA QC
team.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The distribution of exposure appears to be sufﬁcient to develop an exposure-response
estimate. Cumulative exposure was calculated in Matrat et al., 2015 307711 . L"v"que
et al., 2018 6748863 measured the association based on a "1 ﬁber/ml difference in the
annual average daily intensity each year of the speciﬁc exposure time-window."
Additional Comments: Matrat et al., 2015 307711 and L"v"que et al., 2018 6748863 were not evaluated for any metrics except Metric 4 and 5 and had no data extracted because
they did not have sufﬁcient exposure information to be useful for dose-response analysis.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Key elements of the study design are described in the Matrat et al., 2004 study (Matrat
et al. 2004, HERO ID: 3080192) which measures asbestos exposure and radiological
abnormalities in male and female maintenance workers. Male and female participants
(n=336) of (Matrat et al. 2004, HERO ID: 3080192) were aged an average of 44.1 +/
- 7.5 and latency began at less than or equal to 15 years since exposure, 16-22 years,
and greater than 22 years. Study participants complete a standardized questionnaire
regarding their work history, types of asbestos containing materials (ACMs), and other
work-related questions. All participants were volunteers.
Metric 2: Attrition High Studu functioned on a voluntary basis. (Matrat et al. 2004, HERO ID: 3080192) de-
scribed that 80% of eligible subjects participated, and that some subject loss occurred
due to poor quality x-ray imaging and previous asbestos exposure from other activities.
Metric 3: Comparison Group High 95 controls who were male workers in a public hospital with no known asbestos expo-
sures participated in the parent study (Matrat et al. 2004, HERO ID: 3080192). These
controls also received chest radiographs, same as the exposure group.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Matrat et al. referenced their measurements of exposure from the French Evalutil
database for speciﬁc occupational exposures to ﬁnd ﬁbre concentrations to estimate
the intensity and to create a cumulative exposure index (Matrat et al. 2004, HERO ID:
3080192). An article for the French Evalutil database describes all data from before
2012 as using studies which followed the standards of the time, expertise, and that most
air samples were taken with "membrane ﬁlters and analyzed by phase-contrast optical
microscopy (PCOM)" (Orlowski et al. 2015, HERO ID: 3089885).
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Matrat et al. reports a referent group and exposure group distributed by latency or cumu-
lative exposure index (f/mL*years) (Matrat et al. 2004, HERO ID: 3080192).
Metric 6: Temporality High Matrat et al. reports latency as <=15 years, 16-22 years, and >22 years, which is ade-
quate for the health outcomes evaluated (Matrat et al. 2004, HERO ID: 3080192).

Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationHigh Other Non-Cancer Outcomes: Pleural thickening(s): Matrat et al. reports that all chest
radiographs were "classiﬁed independently by three expereicned readers according to
the International Labour Ofﬁce (ILO) 1980" in random order. This includes profusions
of small opacities, circumscribed pleural thickening, and diffuse pleural thickening
(Matrat et al. 2004, HERO ID: 3080192).
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High Findings are appropriately reported (Matrat et al. 2004, HERO ID: 3080192) and ex-
traction is possible. Conﬁdence intervals of 95% are reported where multivariate logistic
regression analysis was completed in the exposed groups for an adjusted odds ratio.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium For the multiple logistic regression in (Matrat et al. 2004, HERO ID: 3080192), three
models are created to analyze the exposure group. Model A measures by latency with
age, BMI and tobacco smoking; Model B measures duration of asbestos exposure by
age, BMI and tobacco smoking; and Model C measures cumulative exposure index by
age, BMI and tobacco smoking.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium (Matrat et al. 2004, HERO ID: 3080192) report using a standardized questionnaire to
collect information on volunteers regarding their work history, including areas where
they worked, detailed list of tasks, duration (years), frequency (number of days a year
and number of hours a day) where exposure occurred.The authors only mentioned that
detailed information was obtained on tobacco consumption and height and weight were
measured to calculate BMI, but they did not describe the information source.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low In an occupational setting, potential co-exposures are not discussed. This is relevant for
(Matrat et al. 2004, HERO ID: 3080192).
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium (Matrat et al. 2004, HERO ID: 3080192) used an appropriate study design to address the
research question with a multivariate logistic regression.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The number of participants was adequate to detect an effect in the exposure group.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium (Matrat et al. 2004, HERO ID: 3080192) provided adequate methodology to understand
how to conceptually reproduce analyses.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium (Matrat et al. 2004, HERO ID: 3080192) provided transparent methods for the multi-
variate logistic regression, organized by three models (A, B, and C) and provided the
covariates used in each analysis.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Measures of exposure were generated using professional judgment based on responses
to the interviews and questionnaires administered. Because there were no quantitative
measures of asbestos exposure, this metric was rated as uninformative. However, there
could be some utility for this study qualitatively.This metric is rated low because the
study or any cited methods sources does not use PCM or TEM.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low Because the authors used professional judgment and responses to questionnaires to
determine asbestos exposure, individuals were only ranked as exposed or unexposed.
Additional Comments: There are several limitations of this study that are important to note. For one, there were no quantitative measures of exposure to asbestos. The information
gathered through the self-report interviews may also be questionable, as even the authors highlight that there was no validation of the exposures reported.
This could introduce a certain level of bias to the results. While asbestos was one of the exposures examined, it was not the sole focus of this study.NOTE:
Based on the new guidance, this study would not have been evaluated past metric 4 and 5. There was no mention within the study or cited sources that
mentioned the use of PCM or TEM.
?No biomarkers were identiﬁed for this evaluation.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Description of study setting was provided, and other elements including inclusion cri-
teria and case ascertainment, primarily from McDonald et al. 1986, HERO ID: 29964,
with McDonald and Armstrong 2003, HERO ID: 709547 giving a briefer version of the
info. The study population includes male workers from a Libby mining company who
have been hired before 1963. In total, 406 males worked at the site for at least one net
year were included, 12 of which were employed before 1940. No other description of
additional inclusion or exclusion criteria. There is limited information on subjects not
included or participation rate, which introduces potential for selection bias.
Metric 2: Attrition High In McDonald et al. 1986, HERO ID: 29964, at the end of the follow-up period (July 1st,
1983), 226 were alive and 165 were dead. 14 men were found alive on 1981 but subse-
quent status was not available. In total, vital status of 405 out of 406 men included in
this study were traced. Death certiﬁcates were obtained for 163 of the 165 deceased. In
McDonald and Armstrong 2003, HERO ID: 709547, at the end of the follow-up period
(July 1st, 1983), the remaining 241 (vs 240 in McDonald et al. 1986, HERO ID: 29964)
known to be alive at the end of the 1983 follow up period were traced via the National
Death Index to 1998, where another 120 were conﬁrmed dead.There is little loss to fol-
low up.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium In McDonald et al. 1986, HERO ID: 29964 case-referent analyses, "controls for each
case were chosen as men surviving beyond the age of death of the case, who had been
born and had started work at Libby mine within three years of the case."In McDonald
and Armstrong 2003, HERO ID: 709547, comparison was made among other workers.
Age and sex were considered in the analyses.Thus, there is only indirect evidence that
groups are not similar to each other.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Details on exposure assessment are primarily from McDonald et al. 1986, HERO ID:
29964, with McDonald and Armstrong 2003, HERO ID: 709547 citing this paper. The
measurement of exposure (a mix of personal and area) changed during the study period
but was ultimately based employment records and quantitative estimates of exposure
using a combination of midget impingers and PCM (cited as optical microscopy while
referencing Walton 1982, HERO ID: 29649, which clariﬁes it as phase contrast opti-
cal microscopy) for a portion of participant"s work history of exposure, requiring ex-
trapolation for earlier years. Air samples were collected using midget impinger before
1970 and using membrane ﬁlters after 1970. Samples before 1970 only measured dust
concentrations without conversion factors. Limited amount of samples were collected
before 1965, and the measurements were much higher after 1975 when the company
introduced a systematic air sampling program. Authors assumed that ﬁber exposure
measures made before 1965 (engineering controls installed at this point to reduce dust/
ﬁber levels), were a fraction of those measured afterwards. Authors further note: "For
the other operation locations ﬁber measurements were available only for the recent pe-
riods. When the data were considered inadequate to describe past conditions, because
of changes in process or control practice, arbitrary correction factors were applied. This
was done after discussion with the company’s representatives and especially with a pre-
vious manager who had spent almost all his career with Libby and who had extensive
knowledge of the operations.""Samples were taken until 1982. Cumulative exposure
levels were calculated based on job histories, operation locations, and estimated aver-
age ﬁber concentrations.In McDonald and Armstrong 2003, HERO ID: 709547, they
used three different indices for exposure: "...(A) average intensity over ﬁrst ﬁve years of
employment (f/ml); (B) cumulative exposure (f/ml.y); and (C) residence weighted cu-
mulative exposure, for which each year"s exposure is weighted according to the number
of years since it was experienced (f/ml.y)."
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium In McDonald et al. 1986, HERO ID: 29964, cumulative continuous exposure levels were
used for case-referent analyses. In McDonald and Armstrong 2003, HERO ID: 709547,
both continuous and categorical exposure levels were used in Poisson regression analy-
ses. Dichotomous exposure SMR analyses in both papers merit a Low rating.
Metric 6: Temporality High The follow-up period is greater than 20 years in this cohort for >2/3 of deaths (as shown
in McDonald et al. 1986, HERO ID: 29964), suggesting there is sufﬁcient considera-
tion of latency for a range of outcomes. The temporality is established and exposure
occurred before outcome.

CharacterizationHigh Lung Cancer: In McDonald et al. 1986, HERO ID: 29964, the cases were ascertained
from death certiﬁcates and underlying cause of death was coded by a single qualiﬁed
nosologist according to ICD-8 codes (160-163). In McDonald and Armstrong 2003,
HERO ID: 709547, the additional deaths were coded by State nosologists in ICD-9
(160-165).; Other Non-Cancer Outcomes: In McDonald et al. 1986, HERO ID: 29964,
the cases were ascertained from death certiﬁcates and underlying cause of death was
coded by a single qualiﬁed nosologist according to ICD-8 codes: pneumoconiosis (515).
In McDonald and Armstrong 2003, HERO ID: 709547, the additional deaths were coded
by State nosologists in ICD-9: non-malignant respiratory disease (010-018, 460-519)
and all causes mortality (codes not speciﬁed but are implicit).
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High Findings of the study were reported in abstract and results. Analyses show relative risk

1986, HERO ID: 29964), while in McDonald and Armstrong 2003, HERO ID: 709547,
there is no covariate adjustment, except for sex and race. Smoking is not addressed.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium The source of covariates were not described but likely collected from employment
records.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low There is no discussion of coexposures in these occupational studies.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The case-referent and Poisson analyses were appropriate method to evaluate the
exposure-outcome associations.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium Both studies likely have the statistical power to detect true associations, however there
are often more deaths in the latter study. The only exception may be pneumoconiosis,
which may be underpowered. Counts are as follows: for lung cancer (McDonald et al.
1986, HERO ID: 29964, n=23; McDonald and Armstrong 2003, HERO ID: 709547,
n=44); pneumoconiosis (McDonald et al. 1986, HERO ID: 29964, n=8); non-malignant
respiratory disease (McDonald and Armstrong 2003, HERO ID: 709547, n=51); all
causes of death (McDonald and Armstrong 2003, HERO ID: 709547, n=285).
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The descriptions of the methods and analyses are sufﬁcient and conceptually repro-
ducible.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium Descriptions of case-referent and Poisson models are clear.

Domain Metric Rating Comments
Additional Comments: Note that only outcomes with a rating higher than Low for Metric 5 were evaluated and QC’d. Many outcomes that only are analyzed by SMR (a
dichotomous exposure characterization) are thus not QC’d.This is a cohort of 2 studies (McDonald et al. 1986, HERO ID: 29964, McDonald and Armstrong
2003, HERO ID: 709547), with latter being a follow-up on the same cohort of workers in a Libby asbestos mine, with more deaths added for analyses. Of
note is that lung cancer shares slightly different ICD codings, however they are also from different ICDs (8 vs 9) but share the same total deaths, suggesting
that this difference has no impact.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium The study comprised 194 men employed by the company in South Carolina for 6
months or more who were hired before 1971. Criteria for inclusion in the cohort were
stated: all men who met the criteria were included. Exclusion criteria and other demo-
graphic characteristics were unclear. Some key elements of the study design were not
present but available information indicates a low risk of selection bias
Metric 2: Attrition High The study reported that the vital status of 189 men out of 194 men were obtained
through local inquiries. The remaining 5 men were traced only through social security
ﬁles.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Low "The mortality of the cohort was compared with that of white and black men in the
US using the person-years at risk method to compute the expected number of deaths
and hence standardized mortality ratios (SMRs)." SMR analysis adjusted for race but
not age. Workers are compared to an inappropriate general population, not a working
population.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium From 1969-1984, the company and Mine Safety and Health Administration took ﬁber
samples using personal and area measures in different work zones. No ﬁber counting is
explicitly stated for sampling in this period, and no comparison is made between com-
pany and MSHA samples. From 1985-1986, the study took dust samples and quantiﬁed
asbestos ﬁbers using PCM and ATEM. ATEM is not deﬁned in the study.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Mean concentrations of airborne ﬁbers were reported in Table 1 and 2. Estimates of
exposure intensity (expressed through f/cc) by zones and calendar years were reported in
Table 3 which were continuous measure. Exposure estimates were stratiﬁed by wet and
dry zones.
Metric 6: Temporality High The study presents an appropriate temporality between exposure and outcome. The
follow up was at least 15 years for the participants.

Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationHigh Other Cancer(s): Mortality was characterized by registered causes of death, which were
coded according to the 8th revision of the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD)
by a nosologist. Mortality from "other cancers" corresponded to codes 140-149, 160,
164-208.; Other Non-Cancer Outcomes: Mortality was characterized by registered
causes of death, which were coded according to the 8th revision of the International
Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD). Mortality from circulatory disease corresponded to
ICD 390-458. Mortality from respiratory disease corresponded to ICD 460-519. Radio-

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Neither PCM or TEM was mentioned to be used to develop quantitative estimates of
exposure. The authors stated: "The mean airborne ﬁbre concentrations for each location
operation, year by year, were estimated from all available midget impinger and mem-
brane ﬁlter measurements"
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range and distribution of cumulative exposure is sufﬁcient to develop an exposure-
response estimate. Five exposure levels were reported as groups ( <10, 10 <=20,
20<=I00, 100 <=200, and >=200 ﬁbers/ml year).
Additional Comments: QC was not completed for metrics other than Metrics 4 and 5 because the study does not have sufﬁcient exposure information to be useful for dose-response
analysis. Metric 4 was deemed low because the authors did not indicate if exposure measurements were done with PCM or TEM.
?No biomarkers were identiﬁed for this evaluation.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Exposure was estimated using a job-exposure matrix; however, it is uncertain whether
PCM or TEM were used to construct the job-exposure matrix. The paper referenced
with more details (van Tongeren et al., 2013, HERO ID: 4142033) only mentions the
calculation of weighted means based on occupational codes.This study or any cited

Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low The study reports the mean cumulative exposure between cases and controls overall and
then stratiﬁed by sex; the range of exposure in the population is limited to the means.
There are no other summary statistics provided for exposure.
Additional Comments: NOTE: This study would not be evaluated under the current guidelines. Metrics 4 and 5 were rated low due to a limited range of exposure and no mention
of the use of PCM or TEM for the determination of asbestos exposure.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low This metric is rated Low because the study or any cited methods source does not explic-
itly mention the use of PCM or TEM. Authors provided a detailed history of asbestos
work in the plant, but methodology of exposure measurement is limited. Generic dust
measures were available from the 1960s and in 1979, 64 airborne asbestos ﬁber sam-

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection High The authors reported all key elements of the study, including location, and inclusion
criteria. In total, 991 individuals aged 30 years and more were selected from 10 villages
for the current study.
Metric 2: Attrition High Of the initial 991 individuals selected, 923 were included in the ﬁnal analysis. Excluded
individuals (n=68) where those who did not either had complete outcome data or lack of
consensus among physician in ascertaining the outcome of interest.
Metric 3: Comparison Group High Key elements of the study design were reported, suggesting that the study subjects were
recruited from the same eligible population i.e., individuals living in villages known to
have asbestos-containing soil. The control population had similar demographic char-
acteristics and the authors mention that the study participants were farmers in both the
control and asbestos villages.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium The air sampling methodology was not described in detail, missing the description sam-
pling ﬂowrate and sample processing for both publications (Metintas et al. 2005 709524
and Metintas et al. 2012 2325159). Nonetheless, both publications mentioned using
phase-contrast microscope (PCM) to count the asbestos ﬁbers.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The authors reported summary statistics representing multiple levels of exposure. Met-
intas et al. 2005 709524 reported indoor and outdoor concentrations and made assump-
tions to estimate the individual’s exposure, reporting three different levels of exposure
as shown in Table 4. Metintas et al. 2012 2325159 reported exposure summary statistics
in the text, using a Cox model that considers exposure as a continuous variable. Both
studies include analyses that only consider exposure as a binary variable (exposed vs.
unexposed in Metintas et al. 2012 2325159, and greater or less than 5 f/y/mL for Met-
intas et al. 2005 709524).
Metric 6: Temporality Medium Temporality is established in both studies, but the consideration of latency may not be
sufﬁciently long in both studies as they had young study participants (20 years old and
above in Metintas et al. 2012 2325159, and 30 years old and above in Metintas 2005
709524).

Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationHigh Pleural Plaques: The mortality outcomes (i.e., circulatory systems and COPD SMRs)
were assessed using hospital records and household index cards (Metintas et al. 2012
2325159). In the study by Metintas et al. 2005 709524, all study participants completed
a questionnaire and went through clinical and radiological examination with chest x-rays
to evaluate if they had pleural plaques, diffuse pleural ﬁbrosis or asbestosis. Study par-
ticipants were also examined using CT scans if the x-rays suggested possible abnormal
ﬁndings.; Other Non-Cancer Outcomes: The authors used hospital records to evaluate
the mortality cause in Metintas et al. 2012 2325159 (circulatory systems and COPD
SMRs). In Metintas et al. 2005 709524, the authors used x-rays followed by CT scans to
see if the study participants had diffuse pleural ﬁbrosis or asbestosis.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High The authors reported results for all the outcomes mentioned in the methods section in
both publications (Metintas et al. 2005 709524 and Metintas et al. 2012 2325159).
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium Appropriate adjustments for age and sex were done in the analyses conducted in both
publications but the authors did not describe the methods in detail (Metintas et al. 2005
709524 and Metintas et al. 2012 2325159). Metintas et al. 2012 2325159 mentioned
data on smoker designation to study participants but it does not seem like the authors
used it to estimate the effect estimates.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization High The potential confounders (age, sex) data were collected through a questionnaire (Met-
intas et al. 2005 709524) or through medical records (Metintas et al. 2012 2325159).
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Medium Data on co-exposures were not reported in either Metintas et al., 2005 709524 or Met-
intas et al. 2012 2325159.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The authors used appropriate statistical methods to evaluate the health outcomes in the
studies’ participants; OR, prevalence and logistic regression analysis in Metintas et
al. 2005 709524, and standardized mortality ratios estimation in Metintas et al. 2012
2325159.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The sample size in both studies was sufﬁciently large to detect an effect in the exposed
population: n =943 individuals over 30 years old from 10 villages (Metintas et al. 2005
709524). n = 5318 individuals ages 20-70 and over from 15 villages (Metintas et al.
2012 2325159).
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The description of the analysis in both studies (Metintas et al. 2005 709524 and Met-
intas et al. 2012 2325159) is sufﬁcient to understand how the data were analyzed in
order to reproduce the reported results.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium White soil exposure was assessed both indoors and outdoors (two samples for each
environment) in each village. Inclusion for indoor measurements included white-washed
walls with white soil. Outdoor samples were taken from the center of the village on the
main road. Samples were sent to specialists in the National Institute of Workers Health
and Security (ISGUM), Ankara. A PCM was used to count ﬁbres longer than 5 um. This
has been marked medium as the authors don’t clarify if multiple time periods were used
for measures.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low Levels of exposure are by exposed and unexposed villages and by men and women. As
there are only two levels of exposure, the metric is rated Low.
Additional Comments: Overall, this study is robustly designed. There is not much information about the Household Detection Index Card, if the family self-reports cause of death
to their village Family Health Center to record, or if a doctor/autopsy conﬁrmed cause of death. This provides little validity in the health outcomes. The
study also provides multiple analyses for cancer outcomes.Note: QC was not performed for any metrics except for Metric 4 and Metric 5 because Metric 5
was rated low.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Key elements of study design were reported in this historical prospective study of n=309
asbestos cement factory workers who were in 1989/1990 aged 57.0 years (+/- 9.5 years)
in V ocklabruck, Upper Austria and were followed from 1974-2006. Estimated cumula-
tive exposure was based upon historical spot measurement data and exposure classiﬁca-
tions assigned to each work area. Cohort formation began with workers in 1974 through
1981 when personal protective equipment became available to workers, and biannual
medical evaluations were available beginning in 1989 and vital status was updated until
the end of 2006. Workplace asbestos exposure spot measurement records were avail-
able from 1950 until 1981. The initial cohort of workers who agreed to participate in
extended biannual medical evaluations beginning in 1989 consisted of n=322 active and
retired workers. Of these, n=309 workers (n=270 males and n=39 females) with com-
plete asbestos exposure history and whose vital status could be followed until the end of
2006 were included.
Metric 2: Attrition High There was minimal subject loss to follow-up and exclusions during the study, and out-
come and exposure data were largely complete. Those workers (n=2) who had moved
out of the country and were lost to follow-up were excluded. Those (n=2) with no as-
bestos exposure history were also excluded. Smoking history data was not provided by
one worker. Radiological data was available for n=301 workers.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium Key elements of study design, such as inclusion and exclusion criteria and methods of
participant selection, were reported and indicate that subjects were similar. Participant
recruitment strategies were not detailed, but participating workers appear to have been
from the same eligible population within the same time frame. It is unclear to what ex-
tent various aspects (healthy hire, healthy worker survivor, left truncation bias, exposure-
dependent right censoring) of the healthy worker effect might have been a factor in the
cohort for study.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Estimated cumulative exposure was described as based upon historical spot measure-
ments analyzed by light microscopy and exposure classiﬁcations assigned to each work
area. Workplace asbestos exposure spot measurement records were available from 1950
until 1981. Each worker was assigned a speciﬁc category of exposure for every year
that worker worked at the asbestos cement factory. Details regarding consideration for
changes in job area or task during that year were not provided. Authors did not discuss
the potential for exposure misclassiﬁcation within these methods, but the misclassi-
ﬁcation was likely non-differential. Mean (IQR) estimated cumulative exposure was
reported in Table 2 as 72.62 ﬁber years (ﬁbers x years/cm^ 3) (70.81).
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium In the Cox regression model asbestos exposure was modeled as a continuous variable,
but amphibole exposure was model as binary. The range and distribution of estimated
exposure across ﬁve workplace areas is presented in Table 1. Estimated cumulative
exposures were utilized and 70 ﬁbre years were chosen because it approximated the IQR
Metric 6: Temporality Medium The study establishes appropriate temporality. Depending upon the date of hire and
outcome of interest, it is unclear if the interval between exposure and outcome was
adequate for all participants for all outcomes by the end of follow up in 2006 .
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationMedium Other Non-Cancer Outcomes: Non-cancer outcomes of interest were mortality from
respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, as well as survival and total life expectancy,.
Mortality data were obtained from ofﬁcial death certiﬁcates. Details regarding validity
of death certiﬁcate data were lacking. ICD coding utilized for death certiﬁcates was not
detailed.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High There were no concerns for selective reporting as all outcomes which were outlined
within methods were also reported within the results. Effect estimates were reported as
hazard ratios with corresponding 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI"s) for results in Tables
4, 6 and 7 for mortality outcomes, as regression coefﬁcients and 95% CI"s within Ta-
ble 8 for lung function outcomes and as odds ratios with 95% CI"s for x-ray analysis
outcomes.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium Mortality analyses appear to have been adjusted for age and smoking. Lung function
outcomes were adjusted for gender and age. Outcomes from x-ray analyses were ad-
justed for smoking history. The strategy for selection of potential confounders, as well
as the distribution of potential confounders, was not detailed, however authors noted the
use of stepwise regression with removal of model parameters with p >0.1 signiﬁcance.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium The authors included all 101 asbestos-exposed pipe coverers and 94 unexposed workers
employed at a New England shipyard in November 1965. Pipe coverers were exposed to
low levels of asbestos through work that involved preparing and applying insulating ma-
terials; materials and procedures had not varied appreciably since 1945. Ascertainment
of prevalent workers was complete. The main issue of note is that no former workers
were included, and no information on rates of or reasons for stopping pipe covering
work provided. As notedin the literature, occupational epidemiology studies limited to
prevalent workers are susceptible to healthy worker effect bias (Pearce et al 2007, HERO
ID: 713676). HWE can result from "the phenomenon that sicker or more sensitive indi-
viduals may choose work environments in which exposures are low" or once hired, they
may seek transfer to less exposed jobs or leave work" (Le Moual et al 2008 HERO ID:
1580313). Though there is no direct evidence of HWE, the authors mention the exis-
tence of company medical records that included information on cardiorespiratory health
(e.g. indicating more frequent dyspnea in pipe coverers, less frequent non-obstructive
lung disease).
Metric 2: Attrition High All currently employed pipe coverers participated in the study, along with 94 of the 101
initially selected controls (93% ).
Metric 3: Comparison Group High The comparison group comprised shiplifters and pipeﬁtters employed at the same ship-
yard in November 1965. This group was selected to be comparable to the exposed work-
ers with the exception of asbestos-containing dust exposure. Controls were matched to
the exposed subjects by age (+/- 1y), selecting the ﬁrst eligible candidate on the list with
"approximately the same time at the yard". Mean age and years of employment in the
exposed vs. the comparison group were similar (age 41.5 vs 40.9y, duration employed
17.4 vs 17.1y), as were height, weight, and smoking history. Details on work activities
were not provided, but the authors stated that "cumulative years in dusty occupations
other than pipe covering did not differ in the two groups" (results paragraph 1).

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Quantitative exposure estimates were based on ﬁber concentrations from midget im-
pinger measures obtained in a single year – 1965 – using the Public Health Service
method, which involves PCM (see Edwards et al, 1968 HERO ID 783893). Details
such as numbers and timing of samples were not provided. Historical measures using
a konimeter from 1945, 1965 and 1966 counting "particles with a length-to-diameter
ratio greater than 3" were not used, as levels were considerably higher than simultaneous
impinger data. For example, weighted averages for 1965 incorporating multiple work
locations were 5.2 vs. 21.4 to 23.4 million particles per cubic foot (mppcf) (Table 1,
text). Konimeter measures from the three periods indicated variation in exposure over
time, with measures aboard ship decreasing (means = 49.2, 21.4 and 25.9 mppcf) and
measures in sewing and fabrication areas increasing (11.4, 23.4 and 23.1 mppcf).
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Exposure duration in years was categorized in 5 levels: 0- <5, 5-<11, 11- <15, 15- <20,
and 20-35y. Quantiﬁcation in millions of particles per cubic foot (mppcf) was estimated
using midget impinger measures from 1965; historical midget impinger data were not
available.
Metric 6: Temporality Medium The study design was cross-sectional, as outcomes were measured at the time the study
was conducted. However, the use of historical exposure data and the long mean duration
of employment (17y) ensures appropriate temporality, that exposure preceded outcome
measures.

Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationHigh Asbestosis: Diagnosis of asbestosis is based on a physical exam and known exposure
to asbestos. Asbestosis was deﬁned for this study as having 3 or more of the following
5 indications, all measured and evaluated by trained study staff: dyspnea, rales, ﬁnger
clubbing, reduced FVC and x-ray shadows. Assessment of each indication was de-
scribed brieﬂy but adequately. (1) Habitual dyspnea, wheezing: self-reported using a
respiratory symptom questionnaire adapted from one extensively used in the literature
(one interviewer; reference cited. (2) Rales (breath sounds from 8 locations, recorded):
physical exam (one physician, reference cited). (3) Finger clubbing: physical exam with
frontal and lateral tracing outlines made used to measure hyponychial angle (ﬁngernail)
of the right index ﬁnger (one physician, reference cited). (4) Spirometry: FEV1, FVC
and peak ﬂow (PF) from tests administered in random order (calibration and analysis
reference cited). (5) Chest x-rays (roentgenogram): posterior and lateral views examined
and rated in random order by three radiologists blinded to exposure status, ratings based
on combined readings. Negative TB tests were conﬁrmed, none of the workers had di-
agnosed asthma. All 11 cases of asbestosis in pipe coverers met x-ray criteria; each of
the other criteria was present in 8 or 9. Prevalence of each indication was correlated with
measures of impaired lung diffusing capacity (Figure 2). Moreover, all 8 cases who con-
sented to an independent medical exam were found to have symptoms consistent with
asbestosis, and 3 cases who subsequently died had asbestosis.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium Descriptive data comparing all outcomes exposed and unexposed workers were provided
(Tables 2 and 3); p-values were shown when signiﬁcant. The proportion of subjects with
asbestosis and with each indication used to deﬁne asbestosis was shown stratiﬁed by
increasing duration of exposure (Figures 3 and 4). However, numbers of participants
by duration of exposure were not shown. For example, in Figure 3 there are data points
shown for 5 exposure duration categories, based on only 11-12 individuals with asbesto-
sis. Presenting only percentages masked the sparse sample available for these analyses.
Because impinger data were available only for a snapshot in time, ﬁgures do not further
quantify asbestos exposure in ﬁber-years. However, in the text they use the mean con-
centration measured by impinger to extrapolate cumulative exposure based on exposure
duration.

Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium Analyses did not adjust for potential confounders. However, potential confounding
by age and duration of employment was addressed by matching on these factors. The
authors further assessed confounding by age by demonstrating that the prevalence of al-
most all asbestosis indications increased with age in exposed but not unexposed workers
(Figure 5). The authors also showed that other potential confounders – smoking habits,
weight, and height " were similar among exposed and unexposed subjects. Job selection
for controls aimed to account for SES confounding: the authors state in the introduction
that their aim was to identify a "control group comparable in all respects except for dust
exposure". Race was not discussed; all participants were male.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium Company records and an established questionnaire were used to characterize age, smok-
ing history, and job function.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Medium The authors stated that "cumulative years in dusty occupations other than pipe covering
did not differ in the two groups (results paragraph 1). Other potential co-exposures were
not discussed, but there is no evidence to suggest important co-exposure confounding.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium Appropriate comparisons of outcomes in exposed workers vs unexposed controls were
presented as means with SDs and percentages in tables and ﬁgures. Methods used to
derive p-values were not provided. Statistical testing was not reported for the main anal-
yses shown in Figures 3 and 4. Note: there is an apparent labeling error in Figure 4.
The 5 duration of exposure categories appear to have been mislabeled using the 5 age
categories which are shown in relation to the same outcome measures in Figure 5.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The sample of 195 participants (101 exposed) seems sufﬁcient for analyses of numerous
outcomes, including individual indications/symptoms of asbestosis. The prevalence of
the majority of indications was on the order of 20% (13% for x-rays coded 5 or 6). For
asbestosis, which is extremely rare, 12 cases were identiﬁed. The authors were able to
illustrate and increasing prevalence of asbestosis with increasing duration of exposure.
However, results were likely imprecise, and no conﬁdence intervals or p-values were
provided.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium Information presented in tables and ﬁgures is sufﬁciently detailed to facilitate recon-
structing the analyses. However, the speciﬁc statistical tests used were not described.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium Statistical modeling was not employed; confounding was addressed appropriately by
matching on age and duration of employment, as well as by selecting workers from the
same facility also employed doing skilled manual labor.

Additional Comments: This study analyzed health effects of low-level exposure to asbestos among all 101 pipe coverers working at a New England shipyard in 1965, employed
for a mean of 17 years. Amosite and to a lesser extent chrysotile asbestos were used to insulate pipes. Exposed workers were compared with 94 unexposed
shiplifters and pipeﬁtters who were matched on age and duration of employment at the same shipyard. The study measured pulmonary function and
physical exam indications used to diagnose asbestosis, deﬁning asbestosis as 3 or more of the following 5 indications, measured by trained study staff:
dyspnea, rales, ﬁnger clubbing, reduced FVC and x-ray shadows. The validity of diagnosis was supported by internal consistency of symptoms and
independent medical exams. While duration of exposure was readily assessed, quantitative estimates based on ﬁber counts were crudely estimated based
on midget impinger data from a 1965 because historical data measured by konimeter were not comparable, and not readily converted. The weighted mean
concentration across locations was 5.2 million particles per cubic foot (mppcf), close to the threshold limit of 5 mppcf recommended at the time. Asbestosis
was not identiﬁed among individuals with fewer than 10 years of exposure. The authors provide data illustrating increases in each of the indications of
asbestosis, and of study-deﬁned asbestosis, with increasing duration of this low level of exposure above that threshold. Issues of concern include the small
numbers of cases, as well as limiting the sample to prevalent workers, which has the potential to induce a healthy worker effect bias due to selective attrition
or transfer of individuals who are sicker or more susceptible to health effects of the occupational exposure.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low This paper was evaluated for ovarian cancer mortality, lung cancer mortality, and laryn-
geal cancer mortality in Asbestos Part 1 and was rated Low for this metric. As described
in the Final Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 1 Systematic Review Supplemental File,
"Exposure assessed based solely on duration of employment at the plant. Job titles were
not available. Exposure levels are reported at the plant level (over 20 ﬁbers/ml before
1931, 5-20 f/mL from 1931-1950, less than 5 f/mL after 1970)."
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium This paper was evaluated for ovarian cancer mortality, lung cancer mortality, and la-
ryngeal cancer mortality in Asbestos Part 1 but was not rated for this metric. Exposure
levels at the plant ranged from less than 5 ﬁbers/ml after 1970 to more than 20 ﬁbers/ml
before 1931. The paper presents SMRs for ﬁve categories of year of start of employment
(pre-1940, 1941-1950, 1951-1960, 1961-1970, and 1971-). Year of start of employment
is a proxy for exposure levels, with exposure levels being lower for later start years.
Additional Comments: QC was not completed for metrics other than Metrics 4 and 5 because the study does not have sufﬁcient exposure information to be useful for dose-response
analysis. This paper was evaluated for lung cancer mortality and laryngeal cancer mortality in Asbestos Part 1 and was rated Low for Metric 4 and was
not rated for Metric 5 for all three outcomes. The Overall Quality Determination for the study was Low for all three outcomes assessed in Asbestos Part 1.
The methods for the other outcomes assessed in this paper were the same as the methods assessed in Asbestos Part 1, indicating that the Overall Quality
Determination for this paper is likely to be Low.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium This study revolved around a cohort of men employed for at least 20 years in one of
four companies that mine and mill chrysotile, exclusively. This represented 544 indi-
viduals from four separate operations. These operations were examined in Thetford
Mines, Quebec, Canada. The participants included represented a variety of potential job
classiﬁcations. However, not many details beyond this were included pertaining to in-
clusion criteria, such as the total number of individuals that could have potentially been
included.
Metric 2: Attrition Medium There was moderate exclusion of participants from analyses. The aim of this study was
to determine mortality outcomes for participants enrolled from the asbestos mines. The
authors were able to obtain 172 certiﬁcates of death, and there were an additional 130
cases for which the authors obtained clinical, surgical, and pathological data to supple-
ment death certiﬁcate information.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium The expected number of deaths/illnesses included in this study were derived from the
age-speciﬁc death rate data for white Canadian males. It is important to note that they
did not use data speciﬁc to Quebec, but it is noted that "national rates are not impor-
tantly different from those of Quebec province but are likely to be signiﬁcantly higher
than those of the rural mining counties in which these workers lived" (Nicholson et
al., 1979). The authors also explicitly discuss the potential for healthy worker effect,
but they mention that "the effects of asbestos exposure appear to overcome the bene-
ﬁcial health status usually associated with employability" (Nicholson et al., 1979). As
mentioned, the participants were compared to white Canadian males, but there was no
discussion of the racial makeup of employees.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure High The authors report that 97 air samples were collected from various work locations within
ﬁve operating asbestos mines/mills. These samples were collected between 1973 and
1975, and a majority of them were personal samples. The concentrations varied greatly,
but it is reported that "in virtually all work categories average dust concentrations ex-
ceeded the asbestos standard then current in the United States of 5 ﬁbers longer than 5
micrometers/milliliter (5 f/ml)" (Nicholson et al., 1979). The authors detail that they fol-
lowed the methods outlined by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health
to determine asbestos concentrations, which utilizes a microscope with phase contrast
optics (1972, 145).

Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Multiple levels of asbestos exposure were presented in the study. Table 3 includes a
range, mean, and number of samples of asbestos in each of the mine/mill locations. It is
also further divided into various work areas/activities, including general mill air, bagging
asbestos, quality control laboratory, crusher, dryer, shops, and nonwork areas. This table
highlights that a majority of the cohort was employed in facility two, and concentrations
are reported in ﬁbers longer than 5 micrometers/ml of air.
Metric 6: Temporality High One of the requirements to be included in this study was that the workers must have
been employed for at least 20 years. This means that there is an appropriate temporality
between exposure and outcome such that exposure occurred prior to the outcome.
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationMedium Lung Cancer: To identify vital status of participants, the authors examined death certiﬁ-
cates of those enrolled in the study. In instances where the authors were unable to obtain
death certiﬁcates due to not receiving permission from next of kin, they instead looked
at hospital records and autopsy protocols. In 130 cases (not necessarily lung cancer par-
ticipants), clinical, surgical, or pathological data was available.; Asbestosis: Vital status
for deceased participants were determined by examining death certiﬁcates. Some death
certiﬁcates were unable to be examined because the next of kin refused or contact could
not be made. There was no report of using imaging tests, but it is likely that a doctor
performed the autopsies to identify asbestosis. The authors did report that there were
some cases of misclassiﬁcation of the health status. Due to asbestosis only developing
from asbestos exposure in the lungs, it "is an extremely rare cause of death in other than
occupational circumstances, the general population rates are not subject to error from its
misdiagnosis on certiﬁcated of death" (Nicholson et al., 1979).
Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium The ﬁndings are reported at various points throughout the study. Expected and observed
deaths are reported, along with the O/E calculations. However, information such as
conﬁdence intervals are not reported, contributing to the medium rating.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium This study revolved around a cohort of men employed for at least 20 years in one of
four companies that mine and mill chrysotile, exclusively. This represented 544 indi-
viduals from four separate operations. These operations were examined in Thetford
Mines, Quebec, Canada. The participants included represented a variety of potential job
classiﬁcations. However, not many details beyond this were included pertaining to in-
clusion criteria, such as the total number of individuals that could have potentially been
included.
Metric 2: Attrition Medium There was moderate exclusion of participants from analyses. The aim of this study was
to determine mortality outcomes for participants enrolled from the asbestos mines. The
authors were able to obtain 172 certiﬁcates of death, and there were an additional 130
cases were the authors obtained clinical, surgical, and pathological data to supplement
death certiﬁcate information.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium The expected number of deaths/illnesses included in this study were derived from the
age-speciﬁc death rate data for white Canadian males. It is important to note that they
did not use data speciﬁc to Quebec, but it is noted that "national rates are not impor-
tantly different from those of Quebec province but are likely to be signiﬁcantly higher
than those of the rural mining counties in which these workers lived" (Nicholson et
al., 1979). The authors also explicitly discuss the potential for healthy worker effect,
but they mention that "the effects of asbestos exposure appear to overcome the bene-

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low To estimate pre-1970s steam engine maintenance exposures in Finland, working con-
ditions were reconstructed in two workshops with the assistance of workers who had
been exposed. During reconstructed dismantling of the outer covers of the boilers of
two engines, eight personal air samples were collected. The authors state that "asbestos
exposure was measured with standardized techniques," but they don’t specify what these
techniques were. Therefore, it is unclear whether PCM, TEM, or another method was
used. The authors also reported that asbestos concentrations in cabins of diesel locomo-
tives with asbestos pipe insulation was measured.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low The range and distribution of exposure was limited. The authors reported that "the av-
erage number of ﬁbres >5 um was 5.0 (range 2.5-7.5)/cm^ 3, indicating medium expo-
sure" (Nokso-Koivisto & Pukkala, 1994) for the reconstructed steam engine dismantling.
The number of ﬁbers was undetectable for diesel locomotive cabins. Furthermore, al-
though different time periods were assessed, the study only assessed two exposure levels
– standardized incidence ratios were used to compare locomotive drivers (exposed) to
the Finnish population (presumed unexposed or lower exposed). Therefore, this study
does not include sufﬁcient information for dose-response assessment.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low In this study of participants in the population-based Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS),
exposure was estimated using two different job-exposure matrices (JEMs) developed
for the general population: DOMJEM (described in Offermans NS et al. 2012, HERO
ID: 3091864) and FINJEM (Kauppinen T, Toikkanen J, Pukkala E. Am J Ind Med 1998,
33:409-417, not available in HERO). For both JEMs, asbestos exposures were assessed
for different occupations using either professional judgement (DOMJEM) or measure-
ment in a set of Finnish workplaces (FINJEM, exact methods not described). These
occupation-speciﬁc estimates were then assigned to NLCS participants based on oc-
cupational history. A metric rating of "low" was assigned because exposures were not
measured or otherwise assessed for the speciﬁc workplaces of NLCS participants.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Exposure levels estimated from each of the two JEMs were grouped into four categories
(tertiles plus no exposure) for analysis. Exposures from each JEM were also evaluated
continuously. Median exposure levels of all study participants within tertiles 1-3 were as
follows – DOMJEM: 4, 20, 38 unit-years; FINJEM: 0.20, 1.59, 6.60 ﬁber-years/ml.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low The study employed two job exposure matrices - the DOMJEM (the Netherlands) and
the FINJEM (Finland) - however, only one matrix appears to leverage quantitative mea-
sures of exposure to asbestos, but it is unclear if TEM or PCM were used. It appears
that the DOMJEM uses expert judgment only to assign semiquantitative exposure val-
ues with corresponding weighting. The FINJEM uses expert judgment and exposure
measurement, though there is no discussion of the methodology used to make those
measurements.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium This study examines exposure by tertile of cumulative exposure, tertile of duration of
exposure, and, among the exposed only, tertile of duration of high exposure. Many of
the analyses use those who were not exposed to asbestos as the referent group. There
is an appropriate range of exposure among the study population to assess the exposure-
response relationship.
Additional Comments: This case-cohort study leverages the NLCS cohort to assess the association between occupational asbestos exposure and lung cancer cases. The study
design and methodological approaches are robust, and the study employed the ICD-O-3 to identify lung cancer cases. There are no major concerns about
residual bias in the observed results.

the analyses use those who were not exposed to asbestos as the referent group. There
is an appropriate range of exposure among the study population to assess the exposure-
response relationship.
Additional Comments: This case-cohort study leverages the NLCS cohort to assess the association between occupational asbestos exposure and laryngeal cancer cases of the
glottis and supraglottis. The study design and methodological approaches are robust, and the study employed the ICD-O-3 to identify laryngeal cancer
cases. There are no major concerns about residual bias in the observed results.
?No biomarkers were identiﬁed for this evaluation.
??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation
Including Legacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos , to be considered as being informative for dose-response analysis, Metrics 4 and 5 would need metric ratings of Medium
or High. This reference did not satisfy this requirement; therefore a data quality evaluation was not conducted.

the occupational settings. They did note that the information was limited, but the con-
centration was estimated to be 2 ﬁbers/ml in the 1950s and 60s, and 1 ﬁber/ml during
the 1970s. It was also indicated that "a general dust level of 10 mg/m3" was found in
measurements before 1970 (Ohlson et al., 1985). Information on exposure measure-
ments ascertainment was also limited in the secondary study, although some levels of
exposure were reported (Jakobsson et al., 1995, RefID 758934).
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium In the methods section, it is mentioned that the workers at the asbestos plant were di-
vided into three groups depending on their cumulative exposure, in ﬁber-years. The
same groupings from the 1976 study were used. These ﬁber-year groupings include:
</= 14 ﬁber-years, 15-22 ﬁber-years, and >/= 23 ﬁber-years (Ohlson et al., 1985, Re-

ondary study: <10 f-y/ml, 10-30 f-y/ml, and >30 f-y/ml (Jakobsson et al., 1995, RefID

and Hogstedt, 1985, HEROID: 3083459; Albin et al., 1988, HEROID: 3082919).
Ohlson and Hogstedt state in the methods that a general dust level of 10 mg/m3 was
applied for pre-1970s data, and that ﬁbre concentrations "averaged 1 ﬁbre/ml based
on several hundred samples from ﬁve investigations between 1970 and 1976" (Ohlson
and Hogstedt, 1985, HEROID: 3083459). Albin et al. provides very little regarding
measurements of exposure, only stating, "Individual dose estimates were calculated for
two thirds of the cohort, the median intensity was around 1 f/ml" (Albin et al., 1988,
HEROID: 3082919). No methodology regarding how this was measured and calculated
is provided.This metric is rated Low because the studies or any cited methods source do
not explicitly mention the use of PCM or TEM.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Ohlson and Hogstedt provide exposure levels by employment time ( <2 years, 2- <5
years, and >= 5 years) and latency time (0 or 20 years) (Ohlson and Hogstedt, 1985,
HEROID: 3083459). This study is a Medium. Albin et al. uses two levels of exposure
levels (exposed asbestos cement workers and the general population as referents (Albin
et al., 1988, HEROID: 3082919). This study would be rated Low in this regard.
Additional Comments: Overall, this cohort consists of two older studies (1980s) where there is lacking information and methods surrounding the measurement of exposure.
HEROIDs 3083459 and 3082919 were not evaluated for any metrics except Metric 4 and 5 and had no data extracted because they did not have sufﬁcient

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low This metric is rated Low because the study or any cited methods source does not explic-
itly mention the use of PCM or TEM. In addition, while conversion factors for measure-
ments of dust are given in Table 1, these are based on professional judgement relying on
conversion factors from American insulators (Nicholson et al., 1982, HEROID 160).
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Five exposure levels (as dust scores ranging from 0-4) are presented in Table 1 with
crude conversions to ﬁber counts (ranging between 0-20 ﬁbers/ml).Pre-1970, 5 expo-
sure levels are reported. Post-1970, ﬁber count measurements show adequate exposure
distribution to detect present associations (0-20 ﬁbers/mL). However, of the 64 total
ﬁber count measurements available, only 8 were >1 ﬁbers/mL.SMR analyses incorpo-
rating relevant exposure concentrations are performed by 4 ordinal exposure intensity
categories (Table 4).
Additional Comments: QC was not completed for metrics other than Metrics 4 and 5 because the study does not have sufﬁcient exposure information to be useful for dose-response
analysis. This study does contain dust exposure concentrations with a conversion factor, which allows it to technically meet PECO. However, the conversion
factor is based solely on professional judgement. In addition, there is no mention of PCM or TEM to quantify ﬁbers.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low The authors highlight that the exposure data available for the plant is limited, especially
for the 1950s and 60s. Some measurements "indicated a general dust level of 10 mg/m3
and half the amount during the 1970s" (Ohlson et al., 1984). Five investigations were
conducted between 1970 and 1976, and average ﬁber concentration was found to be 1
ﬁber/ml. Some assumptions were made by the authors due to less effective ventilation in
earlier decades, so a value of 2 ﬁbers/ml was given. They also note that the highest value
recorded was 8 ﬁbers/ml in 1970. However, the authors did not provide information
pertaining to the methods utilized to determine these ﬁber concentrations.The study or

Additional Comments: Overall, this study had a number of strengths pertaining to their analyses performed, and their consideration of potential covariates. However, there were
also some limitations related to the exposure measurements taken, because there were no speciﬁcs given as to the methods used. The authors note that
there was no statistically signiﬁcant dose-effect relationship between ﬁber-year estimates and lung function values.NOTE: Based on the new guidance, this

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Low Tentative participants were pensioners or early retirees from companies in the Nomandy
region with known occupational asbestos exposure, recruited via mail from their former
employers or in local information meetings. Most had worked in a single asbestos textile
and friction material factory. Some had worked in other environments such as shipyards,
fossil fuel power stations, and industrial insulation contractors. Eligible individuals had
to have no previous involvement in systematic HRCT screening campaigns in their for-
mer companies and have no known asbestos-related diseases prior to inclusion. 706
retired workers were recruited from 1991-1999. Participation rates are not directly re-
ported, but authors note that participation varied widely among industries. Complete
interpretable functional test results were available for 630 of these participants.Healthy
worker selection bias is a concern because of the requirement for no known asbestos-
related disease at inclusion. Differential participation by knowledge of exposure and
outcome status is also a concern, as subjects with higher known occupational exposure
and known health problems may have been more likely to participate. The large dispari-
ties in participation rate across industries exacerbates this concern.
Metric 2: Attrition High Cross-sectional study design with outcome information available for 630 of 706 re-
cruited participants. No major concerns.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium Recruitment methods were consistent for subjects in all ecumulative asbestos xposure
categories ( <25, 25-99.9 and >= 100 ﬁbers/mL*years).
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium The study or any cited methods source does not explicitly mention the use of PCM or
TEM to quantify ﬁbres.For participants who had worked in the asbetsos textile and
friction material plant, exposure was quantiﬁed using a job-exosure matrix determined
from airborne measurements collected annually from 1959-1999 in various areas of the
plant. For all other participants, exposure levels were assessed using published airborne
measurements available in the French database Evalutil according to calendar period
of exposure and typical reported tasks. Cumulative-exposure index (CEI) for asbestos
was calculated based on asbestos air measurements, job category, date of hire, date of
assignment end, and duration of exposure (ﬁbers/mL*years). For analysis, CEI was
categorized at 3 levels: <25, 25-99.9, and >= 100 ﬁbers/mL*years, with the lowest
level serving as the reference group.

Metric 6: Temporality Low Dates of exposure assessment and outcome ascertainment are sufﬁciently documented.
However, length of latency period is not well established (exposure assessment lasted
until 1999, and outcome ascertainment began in 1990). Authors report that all subjects
were in retirement from their occupations at the time of inclusion, but an appropriate/
consistent latency period is not established.
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationHigh Pulmonary Function/Spirometry Results: The outcome of interest was pulmonary ﬁbro-
sis. CT exploration of the lungs with 6+ high-resolution millimetric sections were used
to assess clinical features of pulmonary ﬁbrosis, including lesions, subpleural curvilinear
lines, and ground-glass opacity. A grading scale of 0-3 was used (0 = normal, 1 = mild
interstitial abnormalities, 2 = bilateral interstitial abnormalities with limited extent, 3 =
profuse interstitial abnormalities), with grades 2 and 3 diagnosed as pulmonary ﬁbrosis.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High All results are reported with sufﬁcient detail for replication.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium 2 sets of adjustment factors were used for multivariate analyses. Model 1 included 5
dichotomous (yes/no or high/low) covariates: basilar crackles, observed-to-predicted
ratio for TLC, observed-to-predicted ratio for TLCO, small irregular opacities, and
pleural abnormalities in the X-ray. Model 2 employed a backward stepwise procedure
to all variables that appeared to be separately associated (10% change in estimate) with
pulmonary ﬁbrosis in univariate analyses. BMI and smoking status were also included in
models 1 and 2 based on previous literature. Age and gender were adjusted for a priori.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization High Covariates were assessed by standard interview or clinical examination performed by a
physician.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low Occupational study with no discussion of potential co-exposures.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium Study uses an appropriate statistical method (multiple logistic regression) for ordinal
exposure levels and a dichotomized outcome variable.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium Study population (n=630) and observed exposure ranges (( <25 ->=100 ﬁbers/
mL*years) were adequate to detect present associations.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium Description of analysis is sufﬁcient for reproduction.

matrix (JEM) elaborated from airborne measurements from 1959-1999 in various
workshops of the plant. A cumulative exposure index (CEI) was then calculated and
expressed in ﬁbers/ml.years. Average exposure index calculated by dividing CEI by
duration of exposure.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium 3 levels of exposure. Airborne measurements were collected annually 1959-1999 in
various workshops of plants, other subjects estimation of exposure was used based on
French Database Evalutil. Cumulative Exposure (y.f/ml) for healthy subjects was 88.9,
92.4; for pleural plaque subjects was 137.0, 140.8; and for asbestosis subjects was
143.3,135.4. Other exposure metrics estimated in this study showed roughly similar
patterns as observed with cumulative exposure.
Additional Comments: 2/8/2023 UPDATE: DUE TO CHANGES IN THE GUIDANCE FOR SQE, ALL METRICS RATINGS EXCEPT FOR 4 AND 5 SHOULD BE IGNORED
BECAUSE METRIC 4 WAS RATED "LOW".This study was a cross-sectional occupational study and it examined which exposure parameters are most
useful to the clinicians in the selection of asbestos-exposed subjectsto be submitted to a CT-Scan as part of a screening exercise. While it considered
adjusting for confounders and variables, potential confounders such as age were not included in the multiple regression models. It employed tests ﬁt of data
while also highlighting assumptions and design ﬂaws. Outcome/analysis of asbestosis vs. ﬁbrosis terms used interchangeably throughout article. Overall, a
well-conducted study with ample information provided.Overall, information on the measurement of exposure metric (M4) to assess exposure was limited.
On the other hand, the exposure levels metric (M5) information reported was adequate to determine exposure-response relationships.
?No biomarkers were identiﬁed for this evaluation.
??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation
Including Legacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos , to be considered as being informative for dose-response analysis, Metrics 4 and 5 would need metric ratings of Medium
or High. This reference did not satisfy this requirement; therefore a data quality evaluation was not conducted.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Exposure data was expressed in ﬁbers per cc of air (ﬁbers/cc), and was available from
1930-1975. However, the authors do not provide details about the equipment or methods
used to generate this data. All workers had an estimated cumulative exposure based
on "the summed products of air concentrations of asbestos and time (in days) spent in
various jobs" (Pearce, 1988). A dichotomous classiﬁcation of exposure was utilized
because of the small numbers.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low During the statistical analysis, exposure to asbestos was categorized into low or high,
with high being classiﬁed as 5000+ ﬁbre/cc days and low as <5000 ﬁbre/cc days. Table
2 also examined observed and expected number of lung cancer deaths among the work-
ers based on their cumulative exposure between <1 and 100+ in thousand ﬁbre/cc days.
The authors indicated that this dichotomous classiﬁcation of exposure was appropriate
because it provided "reasonable numbers in both exposure categories" (Pearce, 1988).
Additional Comments: Overall, information on the measurement of exposure metric (M4) to assess exposure was limited. Additionally, the exposure levels metric (M5) information
reported was limited to determine exposure-response relationships.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium This study is an extended follow up of the same North England asbestos textile factory
worker cohort recruited from the work areas with highest expected asbestos exposure:
ﬁberizing, carding, spinning, weaving, and plaiting. (Knox et al. 1968, HEROID: 115;
Peto et al. 1977, HEROID: 3084525). Here, 679 men who had begun work after 1933
and who had accrued >10 total years of service by 1972 were included in the study.
There is limited detail on recruitment or other inclusion criteria. There may be some
selection bias, as only healthier workers would be able to complete >10 years of work in
select high-exposure areas.
Metric 2: Attrition High Follow up for mortality continued through 1978 by the National Health Central Register
and the factory personnel department. 41 of 679 (6% ) men were unable to be traced.
In this analysis, they were assumed to have been alive at the previous follow up date
(12/31/1974), but their subsequent man-years were not included here. Deaths of workers
over 85 are ignored. There is no other mention of drop-out or loss that was not included
in follow-up.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Low The study only mentions "unaffected controls" in the section on lung cancer mortality
and dust levels. Another study using the same cohort (Knox et al. 1968, HEROID: 115)
notes comparisons to "national rates," however it’s not clear if this is the same compar-
ison group for this study. The study does compare in text results workers ﬁrst exposed
before 1951 and those in 1951 and later (i.e., cohort 1 and 2).
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Asbestos ﬁber exposure concentrations were reportedly measured using a thermal pre-
cipitator in years between 1951-1961. Additional support for understanding past area
dust measures in particles/mL were taken in conversations with hygiene ofﬁcers from
the factory. Static membrane ﬁlters in years after 1961. Authors state that for each area
of the factory, representative combinations of measures were used and averaged to be
converted to modern counting methods. "The revised estimates are based on preliminary
data abstracted from a detailed analysis that is currently being conducted by T.B.A. In-
dustrial Products Ltd and must be regarded as provisional. However, they indicate that
average dust levels were in the region of 30 ﬁbre/ml in 1951 and remained high until
about 10 years ago."
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low Asbestos exposure appears to be continuous, however SMR analyses are stratiﬁed by
years since ﬁrst exposure and year of ﬁrst exposure, not by a quantitative measure of
asbestos exposure. This suggests the exposure for SMR analyses is dichotomous.

Metric 6: Temporality Medium There is appropriate temporality reported ( >10 years) to follow-up to establish
exposure-outcome, however it is not clear what share of workers has longer follow up
time, as only man-years are reported, not total workers by years of service. In the pa-
per on the same cohort published prior to this one, which had more subjects (Peto et al.
1977, HEROID: 3084525), 406/1085 (37% ) of workers had >20 years of service. It
seems reasonable to assume a similar proportion in the current study.
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationMedium Lung Cancer: No ICD codes were used to establish mortality, except for gastrointestinal
cancer, however no version is explicitly listed. Authors report that follow-up was itself
completed by National Health Central Register (NHCR) and by the factory personnel
department.; Other Cancer(s): No ICD codes were used to establish mortality, except for
gastrointestinal cancer (Codes 151-154), however no version is explicitly listed. Authors
report that follow-up was itself completed by National Health Central Register (NHCR)
and by the factory personnel department.; Other Non-Cancer Outcomes: No ICD codes
were used to establish mortality, except for gastrointestinal cancer, however no version is
explicitly listed. Authors report that follow-up was itself completed by National Health
Central Register (NHCR) and by the factory personnel department.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High Outcomes are reported in all parts of study along with p-values. Some data is available
in text with conﬁdence limits.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Low Sex is adjusted for based on inclusion of only men. There is brief mention of adjustment
for man-years in the analysis, but no other variables are discussed.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Low Covariate is assumed to have been collected from factory personnel records. No explicit
detail is provided.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low Authors do not explicitly mention any co-exposures.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The study design is appropriate for measuring relative risk and mortality rates of work-
ers from the textile factory.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The number of subjects (n=679) should be sufﬁcient to ﬁnd any true relationships be-
tween exposure and outcome.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The methods described in the paper are clear enough to be conceptually replicated.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium SMR analyses were appropriate, with no explicit assumptions to be met.

Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium These three studies, along with Rubino et al. 1979, HERO ID 000178, were evaluated
for lung cancer as part of the Balangero, Italy cohort in the Draft Asbestos Part 1 Risk
Evaluation (March 2020). Pira et al. 2017, HERO ID 5060134 was evaluated for lung
cancer and laryngeal cancer in the Final Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation (Dec. 2020).
As described in the Draft Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation Systematic Review Sup-
plemental File, "Subjects included men from the Balangero mine worker cohort that
were employed in an Italian asbestos mine. The initial cohort ((Rubino et al., 1979), pg
188) consisted of 952 men employed between 1/1/1930 and 12/31/1965, with at least
30 calendar days’ employment during that period. Mortality data were collected from
1/1/1946 to 12/31/1975. Workers for which vital status could not be acertained and a
small number of contract workers employed intermittently were excluded. In the ﬁrst
follow-up, 1058 workers were included that had worked at least one year between 1946
and 1987 and mortality follow-up was extended through 12/31/1987 ((Piolatto et al.,
1990), pg 810). In subsequent follow-ups ((Pira et al., 2009) pg 805, and (Pira et al.,
2017)), subjects included 1056 men from the Balangero mine worker cohort employed
between 1930 and 1990, and mortality records were evaluated though 2003 and 2014,
respectively. Records were not available between 1987 and 1990, when the mine closed,
so workers employed in 1987 were assumed to be employed through 1990 unless they
died during that period. Additional details in the most recent following indicated that
the initial cohort included 1182 men; the 126 excluded subjects were contract work-
ers, those employed <1 yr, those with inconsistencies in data, and those known to have
died prior to 1946 (Pira et al., 2017) pg 558." As described in the ﬁnal Asbestos Part 1
Risk Evaluation Supplemental File for Laryngeal Cancers, "Subjects were drawn from
the employment records of an Italian asbestos mine (n=1056 men). Those eligible had
worked for the mine for at least one year between 1930 and 1989. Description of the
mine setting was described including some historical occupational measurements of dust
and asbestos."This metric was rated High in the Draft and Medium in the Final Asbestos

al., 1990) pg. 811). In the initial study on this cohort ((Rubino et al., 1979), pg. 189),
an additional case-control study was performed in which 5 age-matched controls were
selected at random; they were conﬁrmed alive at the time of death for the matched case.
No details on what population provided controls. The evaluation is based on the cohort
mortality study only, as this was the analysis carried through the 3 follow-up studies
(Pira et al., 2017; Pira et al., 2009; Piolatto et al., 1990)."As described in the Final As-
bestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation Systematic Review Supplemental File for Laryngeal Can-
cer, "Mortality rates for males from the Piedmont Region were used as a comparison
group. This is a sufﬁciently similar group, however, the study authors note that mortality
rates were not available for certain periods (e.g., 1946-1954) and rates from adjacent
periods of time were used instead (1955-1959 rates applied to 1946-1954)."This metric
was rated as High in the Draft and Medium in the Final Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation.

Evaluation (March 2020). Pira et al. 2017, HERO ID 5060134 was evaluated for lung

As described in the Draft Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation Systematic Review Supple-

((Rubino et al., 1979) pg 189). Chrysotile ﬁber counts were ﬁrst measured in 1969 us-
ing membrane ﬁlter collection and phase contrast microscopy (frequency not reported).
To estimate exposure from 1946-1969, factory records on daily production, equipment
used, characteristics of the job and number of hours/day were used (this method has
considerable limitations due to basis on mean values for large job categories and no al-
lowance for changes in weather). Simulated and measured data were made comparable
by using weighting factors (e.g., more dusty operation for 1-2 hr/d compared with longer
working hours in the past). Less detailed information was included in follow-up reports
((Piolatto et al., 1990) pg. 810; (Pira et al., 2017), pg 558-559)."As described in the Fi-
nal Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation for Laryngeal Cancer, "Descriptions of the mine and
occupational surveillance was described. Estimates of historical mean concentrations
were 37 ﬁbre/mL up to 1950 and 5 ﬁbre/mL between 1971 and 1976. Exposure was de-
termined by employment at the asbestos mine only."This metric was rated as Medium in
the Draft and Low in the Final Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 1. However, the cohort
meets the criteria for Medium as described above.

Evaluation (March 2020). Pira et al. 2017, HERO ID 5060134 was evaluated for lung
cancer and laryngeal cancer in the Final Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation (Dec. 2020).
As described in the Draft Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation Systematic Review Supple-

as up to 100 ﬁber/yr or >100 ﬁber/year. In the follow-ups, exposure was reported as
<100 ﬁber/mL-yr, 100- <400 ﬁber/mL-yr, and >=400 ﬁber/ml-yr ((Piolatto et al., 1990),

has the longest follow-up duration for this cohort (follow up of the 1946-1990 cohort
through 2014), as described in the Draft Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 1. The ﬁrst
two studies in the cohort (Rubino et al., 1979 and Piolatto et al., 1990) have inadequate
follow-up durations ( <15 years) considering the potential latency periods for some of
the outcomes assessed. As described in the Asbestos Part 1 Final Risk Evaluation for
Laryngeal Cancer, "Subjects were followed until loss to follow-up, their death, 85th
birthday, or through 2014. This is a sufﬁciently long follow-up period." This metric was

This metric was rated as High in the Draft Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation for lung
cancer and High in the Draft Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation for lung cancer and la-
ryngeal cancer.However, results for some of the other outcomes assessed in the paper
were reported in less detail than the results for lung cancer, resulting in a lower rating for
this Metric for these other outcomes. For example, Table 4 in Pira et al., 2017, HERO
ID 5060134 reports mortality rate ratios (MRR) for lung cancer for selected indicators
of asbestos exposure, and does not include reporting of MRR for other outcomes. All
three papers reported SMRs for several outcomes, though there were some differences
between papers in terms of which speciﬁc outcomes were included. The most recent
follow-up (Pira et al., 2017, HERO ID 5060134) had the most complete reporting with
95% conﬁdence intervals. Some of the results reported in Piolatto et al., 1990, HERO

Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium SMRs were stratiﬁed by age and ﬁve-year categories of calendar year. Only males were
included. There is no mention of adjustment for race, but from 1981 onwards mortality
ratios were standardized to male deaths from the Piedmont region where the mine was
located, which likely reduced the potential for confounding by race or SES. Prior to
1981 mortality ratios were standardized to national mortality for Italy because regional
data were not available. The authors noted that potential confounding by smoking and
alcohol consumption were limitations for some of the outcomes assessed. However,
as noted in the Draft Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation, "In the most recent follow-up,
data on smoking was limited to 14.5% of the cohort, but the prevalence of smoking in
this subset of the cohort was comparable to that of the general male population." The
outcomes that are known to be associated with alcohol consumption are assessed in a
separate form. Alcohol is not likely to be a confounder for the outcomes assessed in this
form.

possibility of confounding by other occupational exposures. Samples of chrysotile from
the mine were examined in detail for contamination from other materials (Piolatto et al.,
1990 3082492) and ﬁbrous amphiboles were not detected. Crocidolite was occasion-
ally present at the mine. Balangeroite accounted for 0.2-0.5% of total mass chrysotile
samples from the mine. Balangeroite is a ﬁbrous silicate that is not considered a true
asbestos ﬁber and has similar dimensions to amphiboles (Piolatto et al., 1990 3082492,

Additional Comments: These three studies, along with Rubino et al. 1979, HERO ID 000178, were evaluated for lung cancer as part of the Balangero, Italy cohort in the Draft
Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation (March 2020), with an overall quality determination of High for lung cancer. Pira et al. 2017, HERO ID 5060134
was evaluated for lung cancer and laryngeal cancer in the Final Risk Evaluation (Dec. 2020) with an overall quality determination of Medium for lung
cancer and Medium for laryngeal cancer. Some of the analyses that were reported for lung cancer were not reported for other outcomes. There might
not be sufﬁcient information for dose-response assessment for the outcomes assessed on this form (in this row). Outcomes with sufﬁcient dose-response
information were evaluated in a separate form (row).The main ﬁber type was chrysotile. Crocidolite was occasionally present at the mine. Balangeroite,
which is a ﬁbrous silicate, accounted for 0.2-0.5% of total mass chrysotile samples from the mine.This study assessed a cohort who worked in an open-air
mine, and thus these outdoor exposures might be different than exposures in other environments.

for lung cancer as part of the Balangero, Italy cohort in the Draft Asbestos Part 1 Risk
Evaluation (March 2020). Pira et al. 2017, HERO ID 5060134 was evaluated for lung
cancer and laryngeal cancer in the Final Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation (Dec. 2020).
As described in the Draft Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation Systematic Review Sup-
plemental File, "Subjects included men from the Balangero mine worker cohort that
were employed in an Italian asbestos mine. The initial cohort ((Rubino et al., 1979), pg
188) consisted of 952 men employed between 1/1/1930 and 12/31/1965, with at least
30 calendar days’ employment during that period. Mortality data were collected from
1/1/1946 to 12/31/1975. Workers for which vital status could not be acertained and a
small number of contract workers employed intermittently were excluded. In the ﬁrst
follow-up, 1058 workers were included that had worked at least one year between 1946
and 1987 and mortality follow-up was extended through 12/31/1987 ((Piolatto et al.,
1990), pg 810). In subsequent follow-ups ((Pira et al., 2009) pg 805, and (Pira et al.,
2017)), subjects included 1056 men from the Balangero mine worker cohort employed
between 1930 and 1990, and mortality records were evaluated though 2003 and 2014,
respectively. Records were not available between 1987 and 1990, when the mine closed,
so workers employed in 1987 were assumed to be employed through 1990 unless they
died during that period. Additional details in the most recent following indicated that
the initial cohort included 1182 men; the 126 excluded subjects were contract work-
ers, those employed <1 yr, those with inconsistencies in data, and those known to have
died prior to 1946 (Pira et al., 2017) pg 558." As described in the ﬁnal Asbestos Part 1
Risk Evaluation Supplemental File for Laryngeal Cancers, "Subjects were drawn from
the employment records of an Italian asbestos mine (n=1056 men). Those eligible had
worked for the mine for at least one year between 1930 and 1989. Description of the
mine setting was described including some historical occupational measurements of dust
and asbestos."This metric was rated High in the Draft and Medium in the Final Asbestos

As described in the Draft Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation Systematic Review Supple-

recent follow-up (Pira et al., 2017). General population mortality rates using the whole
country from 1955 until 1980 and speciﬁcally the Piedmont Region (where the mine is
located) from 1981 onwards (no regional rates available prior to 1981). The 1955-1959
rates were applied to 1946-1954 period (no available data); this may have led to an un-
derestimate of expected deaths which may have showed and increased rate during this
period. Expected numbers of deaths (overall and selected cancers) were computed us-
ing age-speciﬁc and calendar-year-speciﬁc (5-year categories) male death rates (Pira et
al., 2017) pg 559. The only deviation from this was in the ﬁrst follow-up, which used
national mortality rates were for the entire follow-up period (through 1987) (Piolatto et
al., 1990) pg. 811). In the initial study on this cohort ((Rubino et al., 1979), pg. 189),
an additional case-control study was performed in which 5 age-matched controls were
selected at random; they were conﬁrmed alive at the time of death for the matched case.
No details on what population provided controls. The evaluation is based on the cohort
mortality study only, as this was the analysis carried through the 3 follow-up studies
(Pira et al., 2017; Pira et al., 2009; Piolatto et al., 1990)."As described in the Final As-
bestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation Systematic Review Supplemental File for Laryngeal Can-
cer, "Mortality rates for males from the Piedmont Region were used as a comparison
group. This is a sufﬁciently similar group, however, the study authors note that mortality
rates were not available for certain periods (e.g., 1946-1954) and rates from adjacent
periods of time were used instead (1955-1959 rates applied to 1946-1954)."This metric

Evaluation (March 2020). Pira et al. 2017, HERO ID 5060134 was evaluated for lung
cancer and laryngeal cancer in the Final Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation (Dec. 2020).
As described in the Draft Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation Systematic Review Supple-

((Rubino et al., 1979) pg 189). Chrysotile ﬁber counts were ﬁrst measured in 1969 us-
ing membrane ﬁlter collection and phase contrast microscopy (frequency not reported).
To estimate exposure from 1946-1969, factory records on daily production, equipment
used, characteristics of the job and number of hours/day were used (this method has
considerable limitations due to basis on mean values for large job categories and no al-
lowance for changes in weather). Simulated and measured data were made comparable
by using weighting factors (e.g., more dusty operation for 1-2 hr/d compared with longer
working hours in the past). Less detailed information was included in follow-up reports
((Piolatto et al., 1990) pg. 810; (Pira et al., 2017), pg 558-559)."As described in the Fi-
nal Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation for Laryngeal Cancer, "Descriptions of the mine and
occupational surveillance was described. Estimates of historical mean concentrations
were 37 ﬁbre/mL up to 1950 and 5 ﬁbre/mL between 1971 and 1976. Exposure was de-
termined by employment at the asbestos mine only."This metric was rated as Medium in

Metric 8: Reporting Bias High These three studies, along with Rubino et al. 1979, HERO ID 000178, were evaluated
for lung cancer as part of the Balangero, Italy cohort in the Draft Asbestos Part 1 Risk
Evaluation (March 2020). Pira et al. 2017, HERO ID 5060134 was evaluated for lung
cancer and laryngeal cancer in the Final Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation (Dec. 2020).
This metric was rated as High in the Draft Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation for lung can-
cer and High in the Draft Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation for lung cancer and laryngeal
cancer.All three papers reported SMRs for several outcomes, though there were some
differences between papers in terms of which speciﬁc outcomes were included. The
most recent follow-up (Pira et al., 2017, HERO ID 5060134) had the most complete re-
porting with 95% conﬁdence intervals. Some of the results reported in Piolatto et al.,
1990, HERO ID 3082492 and Pira et al., 2009, HERO ID 2592425 did not include re-
porting of conﬁdence intervals.Dose-response information was reported for laryngeal
cancer, lung cancer, pleural and peritoneal cancer, all cancer, and all causes in Table 2
of Pira et al., 2009, HERO ID 2592425 and for laryngeal cancer, lung cancer, pleural
cancer, and ischemic heart disease in Table 3 of Pira et al., 2017, HERO ID 5060134.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium SMRs were stratiﬁed by age and ﬁve-year categories of calendar year. Only males were
included. There is no mention of adjustment for race, but from 1981 onwards mortality
ratios were standardized to male deaths from the Piedmont region where the mine was
located, which likely reduced the potential for confounding by race or SES. Prior to
1981 mortality ratios were standardized to national mortality for Italy because regional
data were not available. The authors noted that potential confounding by smoking and
alcohol consumption were limitations for some of the outcomes assessed. However,
as noted in the Draft Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation, "In the most recent follow-up,
data on smoking was limited to 14.5% of the cohort, but the prevalence of smoking in
this subset of the cohort was comparable to that of the general male population." The
outcomes that are known to be associated with alcohol consumption are assessed in a
separate form. Alcohol is not likely to be a confounder for the outcomes assessed in this
form.

information was obtained from medical records (when available)."
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low No adjustments for potential co-exposures were described. The authors mentioned the
possibility of confounding by other occupational exposures. Samples of chrysotile from
the mine were examined in detail for contamination from other materials (Piolatto et al.,
1990 3082492) and ﬁbrous amphiboles were not detected. Crocidolite was occasion-
ally present at the mine. Balangeroite accounted for 0.2-0.5% of total mass chrysotile
samples from the mine. Balangeroite is a ﬁbrous silicate that is not considered a true
asbestos ﬁber and has similar dimensions to amphiboles (Piolatto et al., 1990 3082492,

in cause speciﬁc mortality rates between employees of an asbestos mine compared to
a reference population in the same region. This is an appropriate design for the study
question."
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The cohort size was generally adequate, although some outcomes, particularly some of
the cancer outcomes, had low numbers of observed causes of death.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection High These three studies were evaluated for lung cancer as part of the Balangero, Italy cohort
in Asbestos Part 1. As described in the Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation Systematic
Review Supplemental File, "Subjects included men from the Balangero mine worker
cohort that were employed in an Italian asbestos mine. The initial cohort ((Rubino et al.,
1979), pg 188) consisted of 952 men employed between 1/1/1930 and 12/31/1965, with
at least 30 calendar days’ employment during that period. Mortality data were collected
from 1/1/1946 to 12/31/1975. Workers for which vital status could not be acertained
and a small number of contract workers employed intermittently were excluded. In the
ﬁrst follow-up, 1058 workers were included that had worked at least one year between
1946 and 1987 and mortality follow-up was extended through 12/31/1987 ((Piolatto et
al., 1990), pg 810). In subsequent follow-ups ((Pira et al., 2009) pg 805, and (Pira et al.,
2017)), subjects included 1056 men from the Balangero mine worker cohort employed
between 1930 and 1990, and mortality records were evaluated though 2003 and 2014,
respectively. Records were not available between 1987 and 1990, when the mine closed,
so workers employed in 1987 were assumed to be employed through 1990 unless they
died during that period. Additional details in the most recent following indicated that
the initial cohort included 1182 men; the 126 excluded subjects were contract workers,
those employed <1 yr, those with inconsistencies in data, and those known to have died
prior to 1946 (Pira et al., 2017) pg 558."
Metric 2: Attrition High These three studies, along with Rubino et al. 1979, HERO ID 000178, were evaluated
for lung cancer as part of the Balangero, Italy cohort in the Draft Asbestos Part 1 Risk
Evaluation (March 2020). Pira et al. 2017, HERO ID 5060134 was evaluated for lung
cancer and laryngeal cancer in the Final Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation (Dec. 2020).
As described in the Draft Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation Systematic Review Supple-
mental File, "In the most recent follow-up, study authors report that one of the strengths
of the study is low proportion of subjects lost to follow-up (Pira et al., 2017) pg 562.
Loss to follow-up was 2% in the initial cohort (Rubino et al., 1979), 3% in the ﬁrst
follow-up ((Piolatto et al., 1990), pg 810), and 4% in the most recent follow-ups (Pira
et al., 2009) pg 805; (Pira et al., 2017) pg 559."As described in the Final Asbestos Part
1 Risk Evaluation Systematic Review Supplemental File for Laryngeal Cancer "The
study authors note that the cause of death could not be determined for a small sample
(n=6), and a small percentage (3.8% ) of participants emigrated or were otherwise lost
to follow-up. This level of attrition is not expected to appreciably bias the results."This
Metric was rated as High in both the Draft and Final Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation.

Metric 3: Comparison Group High These three studies were evaluated for lung cancer as part of the Balangero, Italy co-
hort in Asbestos Part 1. As described in the Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation Systematic
Review Supplemental File, "The most complete data on comparison groups is avail-
able from the most recent follow-up (Pira et al., 2017). General population mortality
rates using the whole country from 1955 until 1980 and speciﬁcally the Piedmont Re-
gion (where the mine is located) from 1981 onwards (no regional rates available prior
to 1981). The 1955-1959 rates were applied to 1946-1954 period (no available data);
this may have led to an underestimate of expected deaths which may have showed and
increased rate during this period. Expected numbers of deaths (overall and selected can-
cers) were computed using age-speciﬁc and calendar-year-speciﬁc (5-year categories)
male death rates (Pira et al., 2017) pg 559. The only deviation from this was in the
ﬁrst follow-up, which used national mortality rates were for the entire follow-up period
(through 1987) (Piolatto et al., 1990) pg. 811). In the initial study on this cohort ((Ru-
bino et al., 1979), pg. 189), an additional case-control study was performed in which 5
age-matched controls were selected at random; they were conﬁrmed alive at the time of
death for the matched case. No details on what population provided controls. The evalu-
ation is based on the cohort mortality study only, as this was the analysis carried through
the 3 follow-up studies (Pira et al., 2017; Pira et al., 2009; Piolatto et al., 1990)."

Evaluation (March 2020). Pira et al. 2017, HERO ID 5060134 was evaluated for lung
cancer and laryngeal cancer in the Final Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation (Dec. 2020).
As described in the Draft Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation Systematic Review Supple-
mental File, "Most complete report of exposure assessment is in initial cohort study
((Rubino et al., 1979) pg 189). Chrysotile ﬁber counts were ﬁrst measured in 1969 us-
ing membrane ﬁlter collection and phase contrast microscopy (frequency not reported).
To estimate exposure from 1946-1969, factory records on daily production, equipment
used, characteristics of the job and number of hours/day were used (this method has
considerable limitations due to basis on mean values for large job categories and no al-
lowance for changes in weather). Simulated and measured data were made comparable
by using weighting factors (e.g., more dusty operation for 1-2 hr/d compared with longer
working hours in the past). Less detailed information was included in follow-up reports
((Piolatto et al., 1990) pg. 810; (Pira et al., 2017), pg 558-559)."As described in the Fi-
nal Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation for Laryngeal Cancer, "Descriptions of the mine and
occupational surveillance was described. Estimates of historical mean concentrations
were 37 ﬁbre/mL up to 1950 and 5 ﬁbre/mL between 1971 and 1976. Exposure was de-
termined by employment at the asbestos mine only."This metric was rated as Medium in
the Draft and Low in the Final Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 1. However, the cohort
meets the criteria for Medium as described above.

population registers, municipal registration ofﬁces, and local health authorities. Causes
of death were coded using ICD-9, however, the study authors did not report whether
cancer cases were histologically conﬁrmed. It"s unclear if there may be any misclassi-
ﬁcation from obtaining vital status or cause of death from various sources."Evaluation
of all causes of death assessed in the cohort was based on death certiﬁcates and popula-
tion registers and coded according to the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD).
Rubino et al., 1979, HERO ID 000178 coded causes of deaths according to ICD-7. Pi-
olatto et al. 1990, HERO ID 3082492 did not specify which version of the ICD was
used. Pira et al., 2009, HERO ID 2592425 and Pira et al., 2017, HERO ID 5060134 used

Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium These three studies, along with Rubino et al. 1979, HERO ID 000178, were evaluated
for lung cancer as part of the Balangero, Italy cohort in the Draft Asbestos Part 1 Risk
Evaluation (March 2020). Pira et al. 2017, HERO ID 5060134 was evaluated for lung
cancer and laryngeal cancer in the Final Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation (Dec. 2020).
This metric was rated as High in the Draft Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation for lung
cancer and High in the Draft Asbestos Part 1 Risk Evaluation for lung cancer and la-
ryngeal cancer.However, results for some of the other outcomes assessed in the paper
were reported in less detail than the results for lung cancer, resulting in a lower rating for
this Metric for these other outcomes. For example, Table 4 in Pira et al., 2017, HERO
ID 5060134 reports mortality rate ratios (MRR) for lung cancer for selected indicators
of asbestos exposure, and does not include reporting of MRR for other outcomes. All
three papers reported SMRs for several outcomes, though there were some differences
between papers in terms of which speciﬁc outcomes were included. The most recent
follow-up (Pira et al., 2017, HERO ID 5060134) had the most complete reporting with
95% conﬁdence intervals. Some of the results reported in Piolatto et al., 1990, HERO
ID 3082492 and Pira et al., 2009, HERO ID 2592425 did not include reporting of conﬁ-
dence intervals.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Low SMRs were stratiﬁed by age and ﬁve-year categories of calendar year. Only males were
included. There is no mention of adjustment for race, but from 1981 onwards mortal-
ity ratios were standardized to male deaths from the Piedmont region where the mine
was located, which likely reduced the potential for confounding by race or SES. Prior
to 1981 mortality ratios were standardized to national mortality for Italy because re-
gional data were not available. The authors noted that potential confounding by smoking
and alcohol consumption were limitations. In particular, the authors note that potential
confounding by alcohol consumption is a concern for oral cancer, esophageal cancer,
liver cirrhosis, accidents and violence, which are known to be associated with alcohol
consumption.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization High These three studies, along with Rubino et al. 1979, HERO ID 000178, were evaluated
for lung cancer as part of the Balangero, Italy cohort in the Draft Asbestos Part 1 Risk

Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low No adjustments for potential co-exposures were described. The authors mentioned the
possibility of confounding by other occupational exposures. Samples of chrysotile from
the mine were examined in detail for contamination from other materials (Piolatto et al.,
1990 3082492) and ﬁbrous amphiboles were not detected. Crocidolite was occasion-
ally present at the mine. Balangeroite accounted for 0.2-0.5% of total mass chrysotile
samples from the mine. Balangeroite is a ﬁbrous silicate that is not considered a true
asbestos ﬁber and has similar dimensions to amphiboles (Piolatto et al., 1990 3082492,

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low This metric is rated Low because the study or any cited methods source does not explic-
itly mention the use of PCM or TEM. Authors relay the use of an extensive job exposure
matrix that included quantitative exposure measures for asbestos, individual working
histories, and information on speciﬁc job activities and was applied by professionals in
toxicology, epidemiology, and occupational medicine. While the job exposure matrix is
robust and allows for presentation of results based on cumulative asbestos ﬁber levels,
there is no information provided on the analytical method used to measure asbestos ﬁber
levels, meriting a medium rating.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium In analyses with asbestos exposure, authors apply three exposure groupings (unexposed,
<= 5,000 ﬁbers/L/year, >= 5,000 ﬁbers/L/year) to the cohort. The range of exposure
appears appropriate to assess the impact of asbestos on the health effects of interest.
Additional Comments: This large occupational cohort study (n=3,946) examined mortality among Italian male workers in a geothermal plant. The approaches for participant
selection, exposure measurement, and outcome ascertainment were robust, but occupational co-exposures appear to have occurred. No adjustment for
these co-exposures was included in the calculation of SMRs for the total mortality among the cohort. Additionally, the comparison group used to assess the
SMR among this occupational population was the general population, which could have led to the healthy worker effect. Finally, recruitment and outcome
assessment occurred simultaneously, which prevents the ability to establish temporality of exposure and outcome.
?No biomarkers were identiﬁed for this evaluation.
??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation
Including Legacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos , to be considered as being informative for dose-response analysis, Metrics 4 and 5 would need metric ratings of Medium
or High. This reference did not satisfy this requirement; therefore a data quality evaluation was not conducted.

Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium The relationship between estimated mean cumulative exposure, and exposure as repre-
sented by years of employment, with outcomes of spirometry lung function parameters
of vital capacity (VC) forced volume in 1 second (FEV1), total lung capacity (TLC),
percent vital capacity (CV% ) and transfer factor (TLco) in Swedish car and bus me-
chanics (n=103) and a control group (n=83) of suburban bus drivers was investigated in
what appears to be a retrospective cohort study (dates of health outcome assessments
not detailed within text or main referenced study (Dahlqvist et al., 1992 (HERO ID
2248426)). The exposed study group was selected from local Swedish health records of
the Stockholm Local Vehicle Health Service and the local bus transportation company.
The criteria for selection included those workers of age greater than 40 years and with
greater than 20 years of employment as car or bus mechanics. Those with job histories
including spray painting, vehicle body repair activities, or asbestos exposure from other
sources were excluded. Both car mechanics (n=95) and bus mechanics (n=8) were in-
cluded for analyses. Dates of employment for selected sample of mechanics were not
speciﬁed, however the text (page 446) indicates mean asbestos exposures were esti-
mated for the period 1938-1986. The referenced study (Dahlqvist et al., 1992 (HERO
ID 2248426), utilized a total of 89 control bus drivers selected from 315 blue collar
workers and bus drivers within organizational and local Swedish trafﬁc registries, with
exclusions made for those with occupational exposure to asbestos or other lung irritants
and other health disorders, and those dropping out. It is unclear if the number of car
and bus mechanics (n= 103) selected for study adequately represented the totality of the
exposure-outcome relationship for the reported approximately 25,000 Swedish car and
bus mechanics employed in the mid-1980"s.
Metric 2: Attrition High Characteristics, in terms of relevant variables of those possibly excluded due to miss-
ing outcome or exposure data, were not reported, however there was no indication that
missing data or subject drop-out was an issue within this study.

Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium A control group (n=83) of suburban bus drivers described as "without asbestos expo-
sure" was utilized for analyses. Comparison of baseline characteristics between car and
bus mechanics versus bus drivers was detailed, however text (page 445) lists smoking,
age and height were studied as potential confounding variables, and text (page 442)
indicates control bus drivers were investigated in the same way as mechanics. Text
(page 442) noted a similar percentage of non-smokers in bus drivers and mechanics. It
is unclear if consideration was given to the known potential for bus driver exposures
to asbestos ﬁbers released from brakes, gaskets and clutch pads during bus driving
and spending time within bus garages. Uncertainty also exists regarding the potential
Healthy Worker Effects due to selection criteria and lack of information of completeness
of exposure and outcome data.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Estimated mean cumulative exposure and exposure classiﬁed by years of employment
were the exposure variables utilized in analyses with lung function outcomes of interest
(Table 2). Text (page 449) noted asbestos was deﬁned as airborne ﬁbers released from
friction materials (brake shoes, pads, clutch linings) with length >5mm and aspect
ratio>=3:1. Friction materials contained 30-70% chrysotile asbestos. Fiber counting
was performed utilizing phase-contrast optical microscopy (PCOM). Available histor-
ical measured individual exposures for available work history years and those from a
literature search were utilized within calculated asbestos index (AI; see Appendix of
main text for detail) in constructing estimated mean cumulative exposure. Calcula-
tions for modeled AI utilized considerations for eight exposure variables representing
job activity, technology level, workshop conditions and time. Models further utilized
a job-exposure matrix which accounted for type of vehicle, room ventilation, working
activity and working intensity. Job history and work activity data was obtained utiliz-
ing self-administered questionnaires and standardized personal interviews. Validation
models utilized in conﬁrming adequate precision of AI exposure estimates. There is
uncertainty for exclusion of consideration of respiratory protection, however authors
indicated face masks were not utilized by workers. There is uncertainty in the use of
years of employment (Table 2) in terms of accurately representing the asbestos expo-
sure in analyses with lung function outcomes within this effort, however text (page 448)
notes employment time data from company records correlated closely to exposure time
from interviews or questionnaires. Additional uncertainty was revealed within text (page
448) as some mechanics had worked in non-asbestos exposed tasks, such as supervisors,
although their job title within company records was listed as "car mechanic".

poor validity.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Medium Potential co-exposures, including brake dust, exhaust, welding fume, general dust and
silica dust, which might be associated with lung function outcomes of interest, were
discussed within this occupational study. There is some uncertainty regarding these
exposures as exposure levels for these contaminants were not obtained within this study.

Additional Comments: This study estimated cumulative asbestos exposure within a sample (n=103) of Swedish car and bus mechanics utilizing a semi-quantitative Asbestos
Index (AI) constructed from historical and literature -based measured exposures along with exposure scenarios derived from employee self-administered
questionnaires and standardized personal work history interviews. The relationship between estimated mean cumulative asbestos exposure, and exposure as
represented by years of employment, with spirometry lung function parameters of vital capacity (VC) forced volume in 1 second (FEV1), total lung capacity
(TLC), percent vital capacity (CV% ) and transfer factor (TLco) was investigated. The transfer factor (TLco) was lower than expected in car mechanics
(Table 2), but no other lung function measures differed from those expected. Results (Table 1) also indicated a weak, non-signiﬁcant relationship between
cumulative asbestos exposure and CV% .

Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium These cancer case-control studies were designed around the Everett, Washington area
which uses the Sultan River as their primary source of drinking water. To address the
concern that some census tracts with large rates of migration could produce a popu-
lation with smaller than expected cumulative exposures, the study area was limited to
1970 census tracts that had lower than average migration rates. To determine migration
rates, the authors used the percent of the heads of households in a census tract resid-
ing continuously at the 1970 residence for at least 10 years, with the caveat that this is
biased towards including older persons as they are less likely to be migratory. The au-
thors report a "stability indicator" of 12 percent or greater (median 24 percent) for the 25
census tracts included in this study. Census tracts included the numbers 401-415, 418,
420, 501-504, 510, 512, 515, and 519, which represented 70% of the total population
who used the Sultan River as a drinking water source.Cases were identiﬁed through the
Cancer Surveillance System, which is a population-based tumor registry that covers 13
counties and nearly 3 million people in western Washington state. Cases who had in-
vasive or in situ cases of cancer of the buccal cavity (not the lip), pharynx, respiratory
system, digestive system, bladder, or kidney newly diagnosed between November 1977
and December 1980 were included. These cancers were chosen a priori based on pre-
ceding studies. Only participants who were between the ages of 40 and 79 years of age
who resided in the eligible census tracts at the time of diagnosis were included, and this
analysis included both living and deceased participants. The authors explain that qual-
ity control studies have demonstrated that this registry misses less than 2% of the total
cases eligible for inclusion, but this data is unpublished. In total, 445 cases were iden-
tiﬁed as eligible for this study, and after attrition the ﬁnal analysis sample included 382
cases.Unmatched controls in the same age range and from the pooled group of tracts by
selecting 4 households at random from 88 geographic strata (n=669 households), then
contacted those that were not vacant for an interview (n=649). Authors obtained age-sex
data on residents, then tried to schedule an interview with each person of eligible age.
A control proxy (usually a spouse), were interviewed if the controls themselves was
unavailable. The ﬁnal number of controls included in analyses was 462. It is unclear
what the "88 geographic strata" are. However, it would suggest these are portions of
the eligible census tracts from which cases were recruited, and would not be expected
to substantively bias results.The choice to exclude census tracts with high migration
rates may be considered an issue of external validity, as the authors aimed to examine a
highly-exposed population and those with high migration rate may have lower levels of
exposure. However, if understood as an issue of internal validity there is some limited
concern for selection bias as this choice is unlikely to be related to outcome status.

Metric 2: Attrition Medium Of 445 eligible cases, 13.5% refused participation. Of 549 eligible controls, 11.7% re-
fused participation. Reasons for failure to interview cases were either refusal by the
primary physician (3.1% ), refusal by the patient (6.3% ), or "other reasons" (4.0% ). In
controls, failure to interview was either due to refusal by the patient (10.4% ) or "other
reasons" (1.3% ). Despite a lack of clarity as to what "other reasons" means, there is
little reason to suspect that attrition was related to the true outcome due to the case iden-
tiﬁcation happening prior to interview. The attrition rates are also relatively low and are
not a cause for any speciﬁc concern. Due to there being only one non-white case, the
study was limited to whites and thus that one case, and 23 corresponding controls, were
excluded. Two cases were excluded as their interview data came from next-of-kin who
answered "virtually" all questions as "unknown." There is no discussion of missing data.
Metric 3: Comparison Group High Controls were unmatched but were selected from the same age range (40-79) and from
the same census tracts as the cases. Since the authors report a ﬁnal eligible sample of
549 for their control population, it may be assumed that 100 of the 649 households avail-
able for interview did not fall within the inclusion age range of 40-79. However, this
is not explicitly stated. After attrition, the ﬁnal sample of controls was 462. Potential
differences between cases and controls were controlled for in statistical analyses, such
as age, alcohol consumption, sex, education, religion, race/ethnicity, family history,
asbestos-related occupations, and smoking.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Both papers (Polissar et al., 1983a, HEROID 3083628; Polissar et al., 1983b, HEROID
3083701) reported that the authors met with representatives of water companies to de-
termine the source of tap water for given locations and dates. The authors provide a
conversion factor to convert asbestos concentrations from each water district into units
of Sultan River tap water asbestos concentration. The timing of water sampling for as-
bestos is unclear, so exposure might have been extrapolated for part of the study period.
The methods for analyzing the asbestos ﬁbers for part of the study are in cited references
(Polissar et al. 1982, HERO ID 353) and (Millette et al. 1980, HERO ID 60455), which
describe using EPA methods for the identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of asbestos ﬁbers,
including the use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Additional methods are in
a cited EPA report "Exposure to asbestos in drinking water in the United States," which
details the appropriate methods for analyzing asbestos in water samples. Tap water
exposure may be oral (via drinking water) or dermal (via bathing). Information on indi-
vidual water consumption levels was obtained via in-person interviews, which may be
subject to recall bias, especially for 47% of cases for whom interviews were conducted
with next-of-kin rather than the actual participant.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium In both papers, exposure was assessed as a continuous variable in logistic regression
models. Exposure levels are presented in "equivalent years of exposure." The authors
report a range of 0-30+ "equivalent years of exposure" and provide that 1 "unit" is equiv-
alent to 1 year x 207 million ﬁbers/liter.
Metric 6: Temporality Medium Temporality is sufﬁciently established, as cases were required to reside in the relevant
census tracts for exposure at the time of their diagnosis. However, it is unclear whether
or not there is a sufﬁcient consideration for latency. The authors do not report how far
back they estimate exposure history to obtain year-by-year estimates of exposure. How-
ever, two of the asbestos exposure variables included in their models ignore all exposure
history during a 10-year presumed latency period prior to diagnosis or interview, which
would consider at least 10 years of latency for cancer outcomes.

Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium Covariate information was collected via interview with cases and controls, except in cir-
cumstances in which that was not possible. In those cases, interviews were conducted
with next-of-kin. This impacted 7% of controls, and 47% of cases. It is uncertain how
reliable next-of-kin interviews may be, and the impact of this is differential between
cases and controls, leading to potential confounding bias. Quality control procedures on
interviews (by checking 85 questionnaires via callback) found that four of the ﬁve ques-
tions included in the validation check had >=93% agreement between the interviewer
and supervisor. A comparison of coding and independent recoding of answers found on
average one disagreement per 69 general questions and 7-10 questions on an average of
14 different past residences/workplaces. The authors also compared the results of some
subject interviews with the annual Everett City Directory address and occupational list-
ings and found a low level of disagreements between the interviews and the directory,
and indicate that this is not differential across different types of respondents. This may
not be sufﬁcient to rule out recall bias for consumption related questions, such as alcohol
consumption, as it is unclear if next-of-kin interviews would know that information.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Medium No relevant co-exposures are discussed or evaluated in this non-occupational population.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The authors use a logistic regression model to assess the relationship between asbestos
exposure and case/control status. Both regression coefﬁcients and relative odds are
calculated. The authors present regression coefﬁcients for asbestos exposure when es-
timated using workplace and residence data only. Relative odds are presented for three
other exposure variables, one of which was the same as the ﬁrst exposure variable except
that it also multiplied the ﬁrst variable by the self-reported total amount of water intake.
Two more were created that were similar to the ﬁrst two, except that all residence and
work locations during a presumed 10-year latent period prior to diagnosis or interview
were ignored. This study design is appropriate for a case-control study and allows for
the comparison of different exposure assessment methods.

Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The ﬁnal sample of 382 cases and 462 controls was sufﬁcient to detect an effect, al-
though for some cancers the incidence is as low as 7 for both sexes and as low as 1 for
males. Statistical power was calculated for speciﬁed number of cases that could be de-
tected at the 5% one-sided level with 80% conﬁdence. The authors report that for single-
sex analyses, "the minimum risk that could be detected"was under 2.0 for each for the

pected to be violated in the present analysis.
Additional Comments: These case-control studies are different publications of the same data. The authors examined Everett, Washington residents exposed to asbestos-
contaminated water from the Sultan River. They used a case-control design to assess asbestos exposure relative to cancer outcomes. There are some
uncertainties in this study, as the data on water consumption used in statistical analyses may be subject to recall bias differential by case status.

Additional Comments: QC was not completed for metrics other than Metrics 4 and 5 because the study does not have sufﬁcient exposure information to be useful for dose-response
analysis. In addition (from metric 4): There is substantial risk of exposure misclassiﬁcation, as the study solely uses asbestos concentrations in drinking
water with no consideration of individual factors or measure of exposure on the individual level. As such, exposure is anticipated to be subjected to
substantial misclassiﬁcation that would signiﬁcantly bias the results.

??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Asbestos measurements were taken in 1948 and 1957, and were reported as 50-800
ﬁbers/ml and 10-100 ﬁbers/ml, respectively. 41% of measurements in 1973 were above
2 ﬁbers/ml. However, not information is provided on the methods or type of equipment
used to generate this data.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low Very limited information is provided pertaining to exposure levels for the individuals
working in the factory. They highlighted that measurements were taken during feeding
and unloading. In the discussion section, the authors mention that job titles were only re-
ported for individuals employed between 1928 and 1941, and not all of the roles within
the factory result in exposure to asbestos.

workers in Denmark.It is important to note that while there were three types of asbestos mentioned by the authors, chrysolite comprised 90% of asbestos
used in the factory examined. Only three cases of lung cancer were found for the women included, so only results for men were reported.
?No biomarkers were identiﬁed for this evaluation.
??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation
Including Legacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos , to be considered as being informative for dose-response analysis, Metrics 4 and 5 would need metric ratings of Medium

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low This metric is rated low because the study or any cited methods source does not ex-
plicitly mention the use of PCM or TEM. Atmospheric asbestos was measured in this
asbestos factory. These measurements were taken during the feeding of the mill and the
forming vessel, along with the unloading of containers. Measurements were taken in
1948 and 1957, and were recorded in particles per cubic centimeter. The Danish Na-
tional Institute of Occupational Health used these results to estimate the exposure levels
in 1948 and 1957.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium There was a range of exposure levels included in this study, and they were sufﬁcient
to develop an exposure-response estimate. The range of exposures reported indicate
that there was more than just exposed/unexposed in this cohort. For 1948, asbestos
concentrations ranged from 50 and 800 f/ml. For 1957, concentrations were estimated
between 10 and 100 f/ml. Some measurements were taken in 1973, and 41% of the
measurements were >2.0 f/ml.
Additional Comments: QC was not completed for metrics other than Metrics 4 and 5 because the study does not have sufﬁcient exposure information to be useful for dose-response
analysis.
?No biomarkers were identiﬁed for this evaluation.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium This occupational cohort study examines lung cancer mortality and its association with
asbestos exposure among a sub-cohort of white men (n= 1,256) employed at a South
Carolina asbestos textile plant. Men who had been employed for at least one month be-
tween 1940 and 1965. Follow-up to assess vital status continued through December 31,
2001. Authors note the cohort was restricted to male workers for simplicity of analyses,
but there is no comparison of the full eligible and participating study population.
Metric 2: Attrition High There is no evidence of subject loss for reasons other than death (the outcome of inter-
est), of subject exclusions from the analyses, or of substantial amounts of missing data
among the study population.
Metric 3: Comparison Group High All members of the study cohort were white males from a South Carolina asbestos tex-
tile plant who worked for at least one month in production during the 1940-1965 time
period. Sufﬁcient information is provided to assert that individuals across exposure
ranges were similar.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Study authors reference Dement et al., 1983, 66 for discussion of the exposure mea-
surement approach including midget impinger and membrane ﬁlter sampling with data
obtained "from many sources including the company insurance carrier, the State Board
of Health, the U.S. Public Health Service, and the Company sampling program." The
reference also discusses conversion factors, but it appears that these were used to con-
vert midget impinger and membrane ﬁlter results to the comparable units. According to
a methods paper on United States Public Health Service/NIOSH membrane ﬁlter sam-
pling methods (Leidl et al., 1979, 237), PCM was used to analyze membrane ﬁlters and
quantify ﬁber levels. While the original text does not explicitly communicate the use of
PCM, the contextual information provided by these other citations and methods papers
provides sufﬁcient information to merit a medium rating.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range and distribution of ﬁber levels based on cumulative exposure appears suf-
ﬁcient to assess the association between the exposure and outcome. Authors present
continuous analyses with exposure increases per 10 ﬁber-years/mL and results from a
two-stage clonal expansion model by quartile of exposure (Q1: 0-1.7 ﬁber-years/mL;
Q2: 1.7-5.5 ﬁber-years/mL; Q3: 5.5-25.1 ﬁber-years/mL; Q4: 25.1-699.8 ﬁber-years/
mL).

Metric 6: Temporality High The retrospective cohort study design enables establishment of temporality between ex-
posure and outcome. Exposure can be demonstrated to have occurred prior to outcome
ascertainment through the assessment of historical exposure records. Additionally, the
study includes a follow up period ranging from 36-61 years, an appropriate length to
assess lung cancer outcomes.
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationHigh Lung Cancer: Lung cancer data was collected from vital status records through Decem-
ber 31, 2001. Study authors identiﬁed cases using ICD codes at the time of death (from
revisions 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10) . The complete list of codes used for the study included
ICD-5 codes 047B-047F, ICD-6 codes 162 and 163, ICD-7 code 162.0, 162.1, 162.8,
163, ICD-8/-9 code 162, ICD-10 codes C33, C34.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium Results from two stage clonal expansion models and Cox proportional hazards regres-
sion models are reported as anticipated, including the effect estimates and conﬁdence
intervals for all anticipated analyses. However, the number of participants in different
analytical groups is not reported, and many lower conﬁdence limits are reported as not
determined.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Low Variations in race and sex were accounted for via the study design, as the population
was restricted to white male workers from the plant. Additionally, authors report the
development of age-speciﬁc two-stage clonal expansion models and report results from
Cox proportional hazard models by different age groupings. However, there is no indi-
cation that smoking status was measured and considered in analyses, which serves as a
key confounder for assessment of lung cancer. While authors note that confounding "by
lifestyle factors...will be small in occupational analyses", the lack of consideration of
this confounder merits a low rating.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization High Due to the occupational nature of this study, it can be reasonably inferred that infor-
mation on covariates (including age, sex, and race) was collected from plant personnel
records.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Medium There is no direct evidence of a suspected co-exposure that was not accounted for in
the analyses. Authors report the cohort had "relatively pure exposures to chrysotile
asbestos" in the textile plant. While this may indicate some minor potential for co-
exposure, there is no direct evidence that would merit a low rating.

Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The retrospective cohort study design was appropriate to assess the exposure-outcome
relationship in the occupational setting, as was the use of the two-stage clonal expansion
model and the Cox proportional hazard model.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The sample size (n=1, 256) is sufﬁciently large to examine the outcome of interest,
which is further demonstrated by the number of observed cases (n=116 lung cancer
deaths).
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium Authors provide extensive information on development of statistical models used for
analyses, including background information on the two-stage clonal expansion model
approach.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium Authors appropriately employed the two-stage clonal expansion model to assess cancer
outcomes and the Cox proportional hazards model with discussion of the proportional
hazards assumption. The use of lags (assessed at 5, 10, and 15 years) in assessing the
exposure-outcome relationship is transparently reported.
Additional Comments: This retrospective occupational cohort study examines lung cancer mortality and its association with cumulative asbestos exposure with an appropriate
follow-up period. The cohort was of sufﬁcient size to assess the relationship, and the methods for exposure measurement, outcome ascertainment, and
statistical analyses were robust. A primary weakness in the study is the lack of consideration of smoking status as a potential confounder. While a clear
deﬁciency, authors note that the inﬂuence of smoking may not substantially impact results among occupational cohorts.The measurement exposure (M4)
and/or exposure levels (M5) metrics are rated as medium upon review by both set of reviewers. Note for M4: While the original text does not explicitly
communicate the use of PCM, the context information provided by other cited articles. Also, the overall quality determination (OQD) is rated medium.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium 35 non-smoker female workers at a textile factory in Barcelona were subjects in this
occupational case-control study. The authors provide a reasonable amount of detail
about inclusion/exclusion criteria but details about recruitment circumstances (e.g.,
timeline, method of recruitment) were not discussed.
Metric 2: Attrition High There was no subject withdrawal, and a complete dataset was used for the analyses of
asbestos exposure with health outcomes.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium Controls were 35 non-smoking healthy females that were age- and height-matched and
selected from a sample of 870 non-smoking individuals living in the same geographical
area. They were randomly selected after stratiﬁcation for sex, age, and height and "had
no known exposure to ﬁbrogenic materials, no history of acute or chronic cardiorespira-
tory diseases, normal chest radiographs and absence of smoking habits." Thus, controls
were not recruited from the same population. The authors do not provide more informa-
tion on how the sample of controls was recruited or whether they were employed, but
concern for healthy worker effect is mitigated by the inclusion criteria.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure High Quantitative measures of asbestos were "sampled personally and randomly over a 13-
week sampling period" and an exposure index that was dependent on time exposed and
ﬁber concentration was calculated for each worker (according to recommendations of
the British Occupational Hygiene Society). Exposure was measured using PCM.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range and distribution of exposure is sufﬁcient to develop an exposure-response
estimate, and the authors report 3 levels of exposure.
Metric 6: Temporality Low Temporality is established, but the latency period is short (1-7 yr according to Table 1).
It should be noted that the purpose of this study was to assess effects of high asbestos
exposure within a short period of time, though, and workers who were employed at the
factory for 10 years or more were excluded from the study.
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationHigh Pulmonary Function/Spirometry Results: Pulmonary function tests included standard-
ized spirometric measures such as FEV1, FVC, PEF, and MEF.

Metric 8: Reporting Bias High Results of the stepwise multiple regression, which analyzed associations of pulmonary
function test results with a continuous measure of exposure, are shown. Effect estimates
and standard errors are presented in the Results. Samples sizes are presumed (n=35 for
both exposed and controls), as there is no mention of missing data.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment High Appropriate adjustments were made in the stepwise multiple regression analysis for
each lung function test. Age, height, weight, years of exposure, and cumulative exposure
index were treated as covariates. For each maximal ﬂow rate analysis, FVC was also
included as a covariate. Smoking status was not included, because only non-smokers
were included in the study.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium For this occupational study, it is presumed that personnel records were used to obtain
covariate data, since the authors did not specify otherwise.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low The authors did not adjust for or measure potential co-exposures. Due to the lack of
safety regulations and protective equipment available to asbestos workers in the study, it
is quite possible that additional co-exposures in the factory were present. This could bias
the results away from the null.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium This cross-sectional study uses an appropriate statistical method to address the research
question; speciﬁcally, the authors used stepwise multiple regression analysis for each
lung function test to analyze the correlation between lung function and duration and
cumulative index of asbestos exposure.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The number of cases and controls are adequate to detect an effect in the exposed pop-
ulation, and the authors report signiﬁcantly lower FVC and FEV1 were found in the
exposed compared to the matched control population.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The description of the analyses is clear and sufﬁcient to understand how to conceptually
reproduce the analysis with access to the analytic data.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Low Though it is explained why some covariates were included in the regression models, the
authors do not explicitly state that the regression model assumptions were met.
Additional Comments: This occupational case-control study examined the association of severe asbestos exposure for a shorter duration with well-validated lung function tests.
It reported that shortly after heavy exposure, non-smokers showed signiﬁcant reductions in lung function parameters compared to the matched control
population.

asbestos bodies (AB) exposures measured via LM were as follows:. Asbestosis: 106,000

Additional Comments: The overall rating for this study is low. This study investigated the asbestos content of lung tissue in groups of cases of asbestosis, malignant mesothelioma,
carcinoma of the lung, and parietal pleural plaques. Overall, this study was appropriately conducted, but not well powered (especially in terms of the
number of controls used). Asbestos bodies, which are indicative of asbestos exposure, were used as exposure to examine associations with lung disease.
When it came to ﬁndings, the authors reported statistically signiﬁcant relationships between asbestos bodies asbestos ﬁbers. While, this study had some
strengths, there were several limitations. For example, exposure misclassiﬁcation during exposure assessment may have occurred. Additionally, the number
of controls used may be small to detect robust effect estimates.Overall, information on the measurement of exposure metric (M4) to assess exposure was
limited or rated low (authors used Asbestos bodies in lung tissue samples were quantiﬁed by LM and SEM, post-mortem). The exposure levels metric (M5)
information reported was adequate to determine exposure-response relationships.

Metric 1: Participant Selection High Rohs et al., 2008 (709486) and Lockey et al., 2012 3014803 analyze 25- and 3-year
follow-up data, respectively, on a 1980 cohort of 512 workers at a facility that processed
tremolite-contaminated Libby vermiculite (Lockey et al. 1984. 029685; 97% participa-
tion rate). At baseline, all employees exposed to vermiculite and a subset of unexposed
workers from the same plant were enrolled. The 25-year follow-up analyzed chest ra-
diographs for 280 workers taken in 2004-2005 (65% of 431 living; 55% of baseline).
The 30-year follow-up analyzed chest CT scans for 191 workers (44% of 431 living)
in their primary analyses (175 taken in 2010-11 for this study, 16 pre-existing). In ad-
dition, the longer follow-up used pre-existing x-rays taken from 2003-2011 to increase
their chest imaging sample size to 306 (71% of those still living). Risk of HWE bias is
limited given the lengthy follow-up and varied post-baseline duration of employment.
Metric 2: Attrition High In both Rohs et al., 2008 709486 and Lockey et al., 2012 3014803, potential attrition
bias was evaluated in sensitivity analyses that used baseline data to incorporate all living
subjects, assuming normal chest imaging in those who did not participate in follow-ups;
results did not change meaningfully. Survivorship bias was not assessed, but additionally
adding these 82 individuals to exposure categories would not eliminate associations of
the magnitude reported. Given the higher mean exposure in deceased workers, the study
may underestimate the prevalence of lung changes and the magnitude of associations.
Metric 3: Comparison Group High Rohs et al., 2008 RefID 709486 and Lockey et al., 2012 RefID 3014803 compared
health outcomes among workers in the cohort with higher vs. lower past exposure past
exposure. At baseline, the comparison group was selected to include workers whose
exposure to other substances was similar to the vermiculite-exposed group, with the
exception of limited or no vermiculite exposure.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium MEDIUM. Rohs et al., 2008 RefID 709486 estimated retrospective cumulative ﬁber
exposure (CFE) using detailed job histories and available ﬁber counts that used PCM
and membrane ﬁlter samples (counting particles >5mm in length, <9mm in diame-
ter, and aspect ratio of 3:1). Concerns: (i) Exposure monitoring was initiated in 1972;
extrapolations to earlier years may be underestimates. The area level measures taken
prior to 1976, when personal breathing zone sampling began, may also be less accurate
than later estimates. (ii) Information on extensive overtime worked was not available,
perhaps resulting in underestimates and/or misclassiﬁed exposure. (iii) Asbestos expo-
sure was estimated for 1963 to 1980; exposure before and after was assumed to be zero,
since Libby ore was not in use. However, ore used after 1980 was subsequently found to
contain about 1% asbestiform minerals. HIGH. In Lockey et al., 2012 RefID 3014803,
CFE estimates were reﬁned using: (i) more detailed job information including improved
information on overtime; (ii) three times the original number of ﬁber measures (n=899);
and (iii) speciﬁc data on vermiculite sources both before and after Libby ore was used
(Borton et al 2012, PMID 22544162). Exposure after 1980 was estimated using updated
work histories collected in 2004 and/or 2010-11.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium CFE quartiles were used by Rohs et al., 2008 RefID 709486, deﬁned as: 0.005-0.24,
0.25-0.74, 0.75-1.91 and 1.92-19.03 ﬁber/cc-years. Mean CFE was estimated at 2.48
ﬁber/cc-years among study participants. In Lockey et al., 2012 RefID 3014803, 5 expo-
sure categories were used ( <0.15, 0.15- <0.45, 0.45- <1.35, 1.35- <10, and >=10 ﬁber-
years/cc). Mean CFE using the reﬁned methods was 6.98 ﬁbers/cc-years through 1980,
increasing to 7.5 ﬁber/cc-years through 2001 when vermiculite use was terminated.
Metric 6: Temporality High In Rohs et al., 2008 RefID 709486 exposure was assessed retrospectively. The mean
time since initial exposure was 36.8 and 32.1 years, respectively, for participants with
and without any pleural changes. Lockey et al., 2012 RefID 3014803 had 5 additional
years of follow-up.

Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationHigh Pleural Plaques: Rohs et al., 2008 RefID 709486: Chest radiographs taken for the study
in 2004-2005 were evaluated by 2 board certiﬁed radiologists using 2000 ILO criteria;
a 3rd reader resolved disagreements. Radiographs had no identiﬁers;10% normal radio-
graphs randomly interspersed were read correctly. Outcomes were deﬁned as: localized
pleural plaques, diffuse pleural thickening, and interstitial changes. The prevalence of
pleural changes was 28.7% . Lockey et al., 2012 RefID 3014803 also used chest imag-
ing without identiﬁers evaluated by 2 or 3 independent readers. Primary measures used
high resolution CT (n=175) or CT (n=16 pre-existing) scans. Criteria used to evaluate
HRCT/CT scans were described in detail. The prevalence of lung changes increased to
>50% . HRCT/CT is generally more sensitive than X-rays; however, the authors noted
that minor underestimation could occur. Outcomes were deﬁned as: localized and/or
diffuse pleural changes (52.9% ) and parenchymal changes (13.7% ). Pre-existing radio-
graphs that had been taken from 2003-2011 among participants who did not complete
HRCTs were also evaluated in a sensitivity analysis, increasing the imaging sample to
306.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High Both studies presented results for all aims and showed details such as numbers of cases
and non-cases by exposure category. Multivariable adjusted ORs were provided when
there was potential or apparent confounding. In Rohs et al RefID 709486 a few minor
aspects of multivariable models were not clear (treatment of missing BMI data in n=38
subjects with telephone interviews, inclusion or omission of non-participant baseline
data).
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium Most associations were unadjusted, but confounding was assessed. Rohs et al., RefID
709486 showed adjustments for age and hire date which attenuated ORs. Rohs et al.,
RefID 709486 also showed that smoking was not associated with radiographic lung
change outcomes, so adjustment was not needed. In Lockey et al., RefID 3014803 mod-
els for parenchymal changes were adjusted for age and smoking a priori, and the authors
stated that there was no confounding by age, BMI or smoking in pleural change models
via results of backward elimination testing.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium Questionnaires and employment records were used in all studies. However, Rohs et al
RefID 709486 noted that "20 persons reported never smoking in the 1980 questionnaire
but subsequently reported a history of smoking in the 2004 questionnaire".
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Medium Both Rohs et al RefID 709486 and Lockey et al RefID 3014803 evaluated co-exposure
to commercial asbestos by excluding individuals with any such exposure in sensitivity
analyses.

Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium Appropriate analyses were used for all studies. Rohs et al RefID 709486 used logistic
regression to calculate ORs, and Lockey et al RefID 3014803 used log-binomial GEE
models to estimate RRs. Both follow-up studies evaluated the inﬂuence of including
living non-participants assuming normal chest imaging, and of limited the analysis to
workers hired after 1972 when exposure measures were based on monitoring data.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium Both studies had adequate numbers of cases with radiographic lung changes for analysis
(n=80 in Rohs et al., RefID 709486, with additional cases in the subsequent follow-up).
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The analyses presented are readily reproducible with sufﬁcient detail provided.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium The authors explained the rationale for their statistical methods used and covariates
examined (e.g. in Rohs et al., RefID 709486 BMI confounding was considered because
subpleural fat can mimic pleural thickening). The follow-up studies also evaluated ﬁt
issues such as collinearity.
Additional Comments: Both of these studies had sufﬁcient follow-up for asbestos-related lung changes to occur; the prevalence of radiographic pleural changes was 28.7% in
Rohs et al 709486 and 52.9% in Lockey et al 3014803, who used HRCT/CT after a longer follow-up. In the later study, ﬁber measures were improved
using updated information. Both authors conducted sensitivity analyses to evaluate bias due to attrition or non-participation; exposure measurement error;
and occupational exposure to commercial asbestos. Both studies observed pleural changes even among individuals in the lowest occupational exposure
categories, 0.005-0.24 ﬁber/cc-years in Rohs et al. 709486 and <0.15 ﬁber-years/cm3 in Lockey et al. 3014803. Lung changes were highly prevalent and
associations of high magnitude in the 2nd exposure category: 24.6% and crude OR of 4.02 for individuals with 0.29 to 0.85 ﬁber/cc-years in Rohs et al,
and 44.0% and crude RR of 5.0 for individuals with 0.15- <0.45 ﬁber-years/cm3 in Lockey et al. The Lockey et al 3014803 study also found associations
between ﬁber exposure and parenchymal abnormalities. Lockey et al reported no meaningful confounding. Rohs et al presented multivariable-adjusted
analyses which suggested some confounding by age and hire date but did not eliminate signiﬁcance in the highest quartile. Lockey et al 3014803 also
conducted spirometry measures and reported associations between lung change outcomes and impaired lung function. These authors did not list actinolite
as a ﬁber.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection High The rating is based on asbestos part 1 evaluation description: "Subjects included men
from the Balangero mine worker cohort that were employed in an Italian asbestos mine.
The initial cohort ((Rubino et al., 1979, HEROID: 178), pg 188) consisted of 952 men
employed between 1/1/1930 and 12/31/1965, with at least 30 calendar days’ employ-
ment during that period." and the description in the paper of interest (Ferrante et al.,
2020, HEROID: 6861719: "The cohort included 974 male workers employed for at least
6 months and active at the Balangero mine on 1st January 1946 or hired subsequently
until the cessation of activity." While these accounts differ, it is likely meant to suggest
that only subjects with mortality, which began 1/1/46, are included in Ferrante et al.,
which extended mortality follow up to 5/31/2013.
Metric 2: Attrition High In Ferrante et al., 2020, HEROID: 6861719, only 21/974 (2% ) workers were lost by
follow up in 2013.
Metric 3: Comparison Group High As per asbestos part 1, this is rated high, however the paper in question Ferrante et al.,
2020, HEROID 6861719 does not explicitly address this metric. As per asbestos part
1: "The most complete data on comparison groups is available from the most recent
follow-up (Pira et al., 2017). General population mortality rates using the whole country
from 1955 until 1980 and speciﬁcally the Piedmont Region (where the mine is located)
from 1981 onwards (no regional rates available prior to 1981). The 1955-1959 rates
were applied to 1946-1954 period (no available data); this may have led to an underesti-
mate of expected deaths which may have showed and increased rate during this period.
Expected numbers of deaths (overall and selected cancers) were computed using age-
speciﬁc and calendar-year-speciﬁc (5-year categories) male death rates (Pira et al., 2017)
pg 559."

were coded by us according to the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD) classi-
ﬁcation (9th revision)." Authors do not explicitly state which code(s) were used in this
paper nor do they reference a methods paper. However, the asbestos part 1 evaluation
does state that certain ICD codes were referenced, and will use this rating as methods
are presumably the same across updates of analyses.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High Ferrante et al., 2020, HEROID: 6861719 reports Poisson regression outcomes with

Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The study design (cohort with follow up and analyses of lung cancer mortality counts
by Poisson regression) was appropriate (Ferrante et al., 2020, HEROID: 6861719).
However it is unclear why authors did not complete a Cox survival model.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The number of participants (n=953) are adequate to detect an effect in the exposed pop-
ulation (Ferrante et al., 2020, HEROID: 6861719).
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The description of the analysis is sufﬁcient to understand how to conceptually reproduce

Additional Comments: This evaluation is solely for analyses done in Ferrante et al., 2020, HEROID: 6861719 for lung cancer mortality. All other analyses do not have a Medium

ing eligibility requirements or the subjects themselves who were recruited. Because of
this, there is substantial potential for recruitment bias and no data to suggest differently.
Metric 2: Attrition High Of the 312 participants, 304 had total spirometry data and 311 had complete question-
naire data. Explanations for why some data are missing or the characteristics of individ-
uals who did not provide some data were not discussed, but exposure and outcome data
were largely complete.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium Based on what the authors present in the paper, there is some evidence that most partici-
pants are similar to each other (age, race/ethnicity). Statistical analyses adjusted for sex
and smoking history. However, analyses were not adjusted for BMI which was approx-
imately evenly distributed among the participants (normal - 39% ; overweight - 32%
; obese - 29% ). It is possible that BMI could have an effect on some spirometry data/
respiratory health outcomes.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Exposure was estimated for 12 different activities, and a cumulative 12-activity metric
(ﬁber/cc - months) by combining previously completed exposure measurements using
PCM or PCM equivalent methods from different but comparable time periods and ac-
tivity frequency data from subject questionnaires. Exposure estimates and the rationale
for each were based on "literature values, available activity-based sampling results, and
the US EPA Contaminant Screening Survey results." While this method does use ’expert
judgement’, it is no different that the creation of JEM, except for a community setting.

Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Only analyses contributing to the creation of ﬁgure 2 present results using continuous
(i.e., non-dichotomous) exposures. While distributions are highly skewed, it is feasible
that these can be used in dose response analysis. The 12-activities cumulative exposure
median was 4.99 f/cc - months, ranging from 0.01 - 114.3 f/cc - months.
Metric 6: Temporality Low Temporality is established, but it is not certain whether there was adequate follow-up in
consideration of latency. However, the study’s focus was to assess associations of esti-
mated LAA exposure during childhood ( <= 18 years of age) with adverse respiratory
health effects and most participants were evaluated as young adults in their mid-20s,
and 98% of subjects were born prior to the mine closing in 1990. The authors make the
case that additional follow-up studies in this cohort should be done, and that the data
presented in this paper should be thought of as "baseline" data "upon which future health
outcomes can be compared."
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationUninformative Other Non-Cancer Outcomes: Only self-reported health outcomes were used without
validation. There is little detail on how the survey was conducted (i.e., by a trained
surveyor or nurse), that might increase conﬁdence in the outcome measure.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High The ﬁndings are clearly presented with adjusted odds ratios and 95% CI’s as a log base 2
transformation (i.e., a 2-folder increase in exposure).
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Low Final analyses were adjusted for sex and smoking history but not BMI or other potential
important confounders, such as asthma. The authors do not provide reasoning or their
methodology for selecting those particular covariates to be used in the analyses.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization High Covariate data were assessed using valid and reliable methodology. A questionnaire
adapted from the ATSDR medical screening survey was used to collect demographic
information, residential and occupational history, and respiratory health history.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low There is no discussion of other exposures (i.e., other activities or jobs) might have im-
pacted the subjects.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The study design was appropriate for the research question, and the study used an ap-
propriate statistical method to assess associations between estimated asbestos exposure
during childhood with the health outcomes of interest in young adults (logistic regres-
sion analyses).

Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The number of participants (n=311) was adequate to detect an effect in subgroups of the
sample, speciﬁcally those subjects who reported being involved with certain activities
related to increased asbestos exposure during childhood.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium If given access to the analytic data, one would be able to reproduce the analyses based
on the description of the statistical methodology.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Low Though the statistical model building process was appropriate, the authors do not explic-
itly state that model assumptions were met.
Additional Comments: Note that only analyses in ﬁgure 2 meet the "medium or high" rating for metric 5, and thus are the focus of this evaluation. QC was not completed for
extraction, as the overall quality determination was uninformative. This cohort study retrospectively estimated childhood exposure to Libby amphibole
asbestos (LAA) in young adults who grew up in Libby, MT; of this sample 98% were born prior to the mine closure in 1990. Exposure estimates depended
on participant report of the frequency of engaging certain activities related to LAA exposure during childhood, and they found that heating vermiculite,
ﬁshing on the Kootenai River, and engaging in activities along or near Rainy Creek Road were associated with respiratory symptoms (not spirometry
outcomes) in young adulthood. One notable limitation not addressed in the metrics under consideration is that of possible recall bias among participants,
which may impact exposure estimates. Another is that health outcomes are based solely on self-report without conﬁrmation or validation.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low There was an interview conducted to ascertain information about occupational history
and resulting potential exposures . Asbestos exposure was classiﬁed as low ( <0.26 ﬁ-
bres/cm^ 3) and high ( >0.26 ﬁbres/cm^ 3). These concentrations were "based on the
product of the probability and the intensity of exposure to each agent for at least 1 year"
(Santibanez et al., 2008).The study or any cited methods source does not explicitly men-
tion the use of PCM or TEM.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low In Table 2, asbestos exposure levels were only reported as high or low, although the
authors do note that there is an unexposed category. However, the range of exposure in
the population is limited and is based on responses to interview questions.
Additional Comments: Based on the auto-calculated score, this paper was rated as a medium. However, there were some shortcomings in the paper that should be mentioned. The
authors highlight that the case-control design of this study may not be the best option for occupational exposures. There also may have been a low number
of individuals present in each job classiﬁcation. They also noted that the FINJEM job exposure matrix may have resulted in overestimation of asbestos
exposure, as there were no asbestos mines in Spain.NOTE: Based on the current guidelines, this study would not have undergone further evaluation after
metric 4 and 5. Metric 4 was rated as low because there was no mention in the study or cited sources about the use of PCM or TEM.

utilizing detailed quantitative industrial hygiene sampling results over time ascribed to
occupational job titles and overviewed by industry experts. Details regarding utilization
of PCM or TEM for asbestos analysis are not provided. It is unclear if the time periods
with quantitative measures within the JEM corresponded to the time periods of interest.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low Outcome odds ratios in Tables 3 and 4 were presented across only two asbestos expo-
sure categories of Low ( <=0.26 ﬁbers/cm^ 3) and High ( >0.26 ﬁbers/cm^ 3), with the

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low For this study, the cumulative exposure to asbestos was estimated for each participant.
These values were determined based on job titles, main occupational tasks, and self-
reported periods of exposure. The authors indicated that a computer program was used
to determine these concentrations based on ambient monitoring data at deﬁned work-
places. Cumulative exposure "was expressed as the product of the total exposure dura-
tion and the 8-h time weighted average ﬁber concentration" in ﬁber-years (Schikowsky
et al., 2017). This metric is rated low because the study or any cited methods source
does not mention the use of PCM or TEM.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range of exposure present in this study is adequate for examining an exposure-
response relationship. The average cumulative asbestos exposure for the participants
was 49.0 ﬁber years, with a range of 0.1-844.9 ﬁber years.
Additional Comments: This study had a number of strengths and limitations. One of the biggest limitations is a lack of direct asbestos measurements. Cumulative asbestos exposure
was estimated based on job titles, occupational tasks, and self-reported periods of exposure. This limits the potential for a dose-response relationship. The
authors also reported that there was no statistically signiﬁcant differences between lung function and asbestos exposure. Strengths of this study included
using regression analyses to be able to perform intra-group comparisons, such as based on smoking status. It is important to note that metric 4 was rated as
low because there was no mention of PCM or TEM in the methods or any cited source.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection High In this retrospective cohort study, Seidel et al 1984 (HEROID 257) examined cause-
speciﬁc mortality in a cohort of male workers at an amosite asbestos factory in Paterson,
NJ that operated from June 1941 to November 1954. The cohort was described as al-
most entirely white (mentioned in Seidman et al., 1979 HEROID 94625). This study
excluded deaths in the ﬁrst ﬁve years, analyzing mortality occurring 5-40 years after
employment. Of all 933 men recruited to work from June 1941 to December 1945, this
study excluded 113: 35 who worked with asbestos elsewhere (21 before starting and 14
afterwards); 40 who died within 5 years; and 38 lost to follow-up shortly after leaving
the plant. The remaining 820 participants had worked at the facility for as little as one
month up to several years. The mean age at employment was 41.9 years (50.8% aged
>40 years). Three aspects of participant selection helped to limit bias. First, the study
avoided healthy worker selection bias because all workers were eligible for inclusion
regardless of date of initial employment, and regardless of duration of employment. In
addition, the study used an exposure lag to reduce potential bias by taking disease la-
tency into account: asbestos exposure at this plant may not have been causally related
to disease outcomes with latency periods of 5 years. Finally, participants exposed to
asbestos in other work settings were excluded.
Metric 2: Attrition High Only a few eligible workers (n=38) had been lost to follow-up at the start of this study.
There was little additional attrition of the 820 participants in this follow-up through
1982, which included: 4 additional men lost to follow-up, and 5 who contributed person-
time until starting asbestos work elsewhere (i.e., became ineligible; see p. 3). Of the 811
remaining men, 593 had died and 218 were still alive, accounting for the complete co-
hort. A later publication (Seidman et al., 1986, HEROID 290) reported similar numbers
(5 lost to follow-up, 6 who began asbestos work elsewhere, 216 alive). Table 1 shows,
for each 5-year period of follow-up, the number of workers at risk, the mean age of
those workers, and the number of deaths that occurred, along with the small number lost
to follow-up.

Metric 3: Comparison Group High Standardized mortality ratios were calculated comparing all eligible workers in the co-
hort to white male residents of New Jersey in the same 5-year age groups during the
same calendar periods. The authors reported elsewhere (Seidman et al., 1979 HEROID
94625) that death rates from cancer in New Jersey were "among the highest in the
United States". The choice of the state referent helped to account for the regional back-
ground rates of cancer mortality.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low No ﬁber or dust count measures were available for this facility. Estimates were based
on measures taken in 1967, 1970 and 1971 at two other plants run by the same company
(in Tyler, TX; Port Allegany, PA) making the same products with the same machinery.
Details on sampling equipment and procedures, or references to obtain that informa-
tion, were not provided. Dr. William Nicholson helped to "assign plausible estimates" to
"particular jobs" (i.e., estimates were extrapolated from later measures at other facilities
using professional judgment). There were no details on how data were used, no discus-
sion of comparable ventilation/dust extraction, and no references cited. It is not possible
to ascertain the likely validity of ﬁber count estimates. Fiber-years/cc for each worker
was calculated by multiplying estimated ﬁber counts for each job duty by the duration
of work in that post. The median count of ﬁbers >5mper cc across jobs was 50; counts
for a list of job titles were shown in Table 5 (e.g., 5 for ofﬁce workers, 15 for inspectors
and foremen, 50 for production supervisors, 100 for pulverizers). Potential sources of
error noted by the authors included: (i) the tendency for industrial hygienists to over-
sample dustier areas (counts too high, underestimate dose-response); (ii) the possibility
that short-term workers "may have experienced an apprenticeship period in which they
did some of the dirtier work in their department" (counts too low, over-estimate effect of
short-term exposure); and (iii) lack of information on use of respirators (measurement
error, uncertain if a source of bias). The study reports that there was a "concerted ef-
fort to have the Paterson plant workers use respirator protectors" although no details on
compliance are provided.

Metric 8: Reporting Bias High Information is presented for all outcomes described. The authors present details on the
observed and expected numbers of deaths stratiﬁed by categories of exposure or time
period, along with the resulting SMRs; statistical signiﬁcance is indicated. There is no
evidence of selective reporting.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment High SMR calculations accounted for expected cases based on 5-year age groups and calendar
period of death. The participants were male and described as almost exclusively white,
so sex and race adjustments were not needed. No other covariates were considered (e.g.,
smoking, alcohol), as is habitual in SMR studies.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium Information on age and calendar period of death were likely obtained from plant
records, death certiﬁcates and other medical record sources.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low In this occupational setting, potential co-exposures are not discussed. There is no in-
formation to suggest the presence of other important co-exposures in this setting. The
factory supplied the US. Navy with asbestos insulation for the pipes, boilers, and tur-
bines of its ships. The procedures in the factory were described on p. 5 (Seidman et al.,
1984, HEROID 257).
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The retrospective cohort design was appropriate. The study used appropriate methods to
calculate SMRs. Poisson distribution assumptions were used to calculate two-sided tests
of signiﬁcance. This study calculated SMRs for increasing cumulative follow-up, adding
5-year increments of elapsed time since ﬁrst employment (e.g., 5-10y, 5-15y).
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium Sample size was adequate (n=820) and mortality was high ( >50% ). Cancer types were
pooled when data were sparse (e.g., gastrointestinal). The authors noted, however, that
the number of man-years included in the analyses was short due to the high death rates.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The descriptions of analyses are brief but adequate. Tables included detailed counts of
observed and expected deaths.

Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium The SMR methods used were appropriate.
Additional Comments: This retrospective cohort study evaluated mortality in 820 workers at an amosite factory in New Jersey that operated between 1941 and 1954. Workers
were almost exclusively white males. Results are presented as SMRs using the New Jersey population as the referent. The cohort had important strengths.
First, analyses included deaths that occurred from 5 to 40 years after employment, incorporating a lag to accommodate disease latency and reducing
potential attribution bias. Second, the study reduced the likelihood of healthy worker selection bias by including all workers who were not exposed to
asbestos elsewhere regardless of date of initial employment, and regardless of duration of employment. Third, employment patterns facilitated the analysis
of mortality in workers with as little as one month of employment, and included multiple time windows of less than one year duration of employment.
The authors noted that this cohort offered a unique opportunity to study "men with a very limited duration of intense work exposure to amosite asbestos,
followed by long observation". Fourth, with a mean age at employment of more than 40 years (due to the ongoing war "siphoning off" younger men),
mortality was high, with deaths accumulating after a relatively short period. 52 deaths occurred within 5-10 years of employment, and cumulative mortality
through 40 years of follow-up was high (n=593). Finally, the authors were able to access medical records that appear to have improved the characterization
of outcomes such as mesotheliomas. Details on the methods used were not included in this manuscript, but are discussed elsewhere (e.g., Selikoff et al.,
1992 HEROID 709720). The study"s major limitation is that ﬁber count data were not available for this facility. Estimates were extrapolated based on
measures taken at later dates at other locations operated by the same company, based on professional judgment. Validity of these estimates cannot be
ascertained.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low This metric is rated Low because the study or any cited methods source does not explic-
itly mention the use of PCM or TEM.Authors state that there was "no direct observa-
tions of ﬁber counts in this factory". Instead, ﬁber counts from other Paterson factories
were used in this study. There is more information of the earlier version of this study,
which reports that that Paterson factory used the same ﬁbers and followed the same
production process. Samples were made in October 1971 and followed "5u + ﬁbers av-
eraged as high as 23 ﬁbers/ml (Seidman et al., 1979). There is no deﬁning of what tools
were used to measure ﬁbers in either study.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Range of exposure is appropriate, as it ranges in elapsed number of years since onset of
work as 5-9 years, 5-14 years, 5-19 years, 5-24 years, 5-29 years, 5-34 years, and 5-39
years. However, the exposure dose is not based on ﬁber concentration but on exposure
time.
Additional Comments: Please note that this study would not be evaluated under the current guidelines. This is due to the low rating for metric 4, as no PCM or TEM was mentioned
in the study or a cited sourceThis study is a follow-up to RefID 94625 by the same authors. Comments referencing this study will be cited as (Seidman
et al., 1979).Overall, this study provides an analysis of workers from the Paterson factory to that of the general New Jersey population. There is some
discrepancy when it comes to the race of the cohort and the comparison groups, and age is not provided in the study. Conﬁdence intervals are also not
provided in the study results of SMRs and SIRs, but signiﬁcant is noted when appropriate. Smoking is not a part of the analysis as a confounder, which
may have introduced bias to both the workers and comparison group.
?No biomarkers were identiﬁed for this evaluation.
??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation
Including Legacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos , to be considered as being informative for dose-response analysis, Metrics 4 and 5 would need metric ratings of Medium
or High. This reference did not satisfy this requirement; therefore a data quality evaluation was not conducted.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Key elements of the study design were reported within this retrospective cohort study
of an initial group of n=933 males recruited to work at an amosite asbestos factory in
Paterson, New Jersey from June, 1941 through December, 1945 who were followed
up for mortality outcomes from ﬁve through 35 years after onset of work. The authors
aimed to study a population of men with a limited duration of intense work exposure to
amosite asbestos with a long observation period. Authors described the population in
the initial years as almost entirely white. Authors noted that n=113 men were excluded
from analysis including n=20 with prior asbestos work. Additional men with less than
ﬁve years of employment were excluded due to leaving work to take up asbestos work
elsewhere (n=14), death in the ﬁrst ﬁve years of employment (n=41), and loss to follow-
up after leaving work in the ﬁrst ﬁve years of employment (n=38). A total of n=820
male workers were left for the current analysis. The distributions of these exclusions
with respect to exposure and outcomes were not reported.
Metric 2: Attrition Medium Cause of death information was available for all n=528 deaths occurring after 5 years
from onset of asbestos work among the n=820 workers in the cohort for study. The
authors described a number of workers withdrawn alive at some time between 5 and
35 years of work to include n=5 men lost to follow-up, n=5 men who left the study site
work to work elsewhere, and n=155 men who had begun work 1943-1945 but who had
not yet attained their 35th year of observation by December 31, 1977. Exposure data for
participants and those lost follow-up were not obtained as the study authors noted use
of length of time worked in the amosite asbestos factory as the measure of asbestos dose
with no measured exposure estimates given for categories of years worked.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium The choice of a reference population is reported as the age- and year-speciﬁc white
male general New Jersey population for the SMR analyses results. There is potential
for healthy worker effect in terms of possible left truncation bias, as the cohort for the
current study was restricted to workers with at least ﬁve years of employment, such that
all workers had to survive for at least ﬁve years to be included.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Method of quantifying/counting ﬁbers was not speciﬁed.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Medium based on use of US PHS NIOSH data (collected via PCM ) for asbestos esti-
mates extrapolated from PA and TX plant. Some professional judgement exercised in
deriving estimates based on job function but estimates not solely based on judgement.

obtained through death certiﬁcate information only for some analyses, as well as accord-
ing to "best evidence" established from additional information obtained from autopsy,
surgical specimens, x-ray ﬁlms and clinical ﬁndings for other analyses. ICD codes were
not detailed, however authors noted that coding for the cause of death was that of the
VI through VIII revisions of the International List in use in the U.S. from 1949 onward.
Data for the number of deaths by cause of death in the New Jersey general white male
population through 1975 was described as available through the annual vital statistics
publications, with additional data for 1976 obtained from the National Center for Health
Statistics. As mortality data for 1977 was not yet available, the study authors extrap-
olated for 1977 the data from 1970-1976. Authors described additional extrapolations
necessary to account for the V to VI revision of the International List, as well as as-
sumptions made in calculations of the comparison population rates for lung cancer, as
the numbers of deaths by age were described as available for total cancer of the respira-
tory system but not for lung cancer speciﬁcally for New Jersey white males.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium There were no concerns for selective reporting. SMRs in Table 2 and mortality rates
across age and time since ﬁrst exposure groups per man years in production workers
in Table 3 were reported as single values, with no measures of variation or conﬁdence
intervals.

Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium Other than stratiﬁcation for years since ﬁrst exposure and age in SMR results, no ad-
ditional adjustments or consideration for differences between exposed and comparison
groups regarding distributions of relevant covariates (such as smoking status) were de-
tailed. The cohort for study and the comparison population for SMR analyses was re-
stricted to males. The study also notes that the initial group was "almost entirely white."
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium Although not speciﬁed within this occupational study, it is assumed that personnel ﬁles
were utilized to obtain age and time since ﬁrst employed/exposed data.

Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low Potential co-exposures were not detailed. The members of the cohort were described
only as males recruited to work at an amosite asbestos factory in Paterson, New Jersey
from June, 1941 through December, 1945 and followed up for mortality outcomes from
ﬁve through 35 years after onset of work. Considerations for workers who might have
initially left and worked elsewhere with additional exposures but eventually returned
to asbestos work were not detailed. However, there was no evidence that there was an
unbalanced provision of co-exposures among exposure groups. There is no mention of
co-exposure , so Low is appropriate based on that.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The study design was appropriate as an early study to address the research aims, how-
ever no quantitative measures of exposure were described for the groups utilized within
the SMR analyses presented.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The number of participants (n=820) was adequate, however formal statistical compar-
isons between exposed and non-exposed workers, or across elapsed years since onset of
work groups were not detailed.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The description of SMR analyses and formation of rates for the comparison population
was presented in detail and generally sufﬁcient to understand.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis N/A Model building was not presented, but the study’s approach of calculating SMRs is
appropriate.
Additional Comments: This study extended the follow-up of a previous report on the mortality experience of a group of Paterson, New Jersey amosite asbestos factory workers
followed from the onset of work, 1941-1945, through 30 years of observation. The current study extended the observation period to 35 years after onset of
work and noted that several men previously lost to follow up were located and included in this study reporting mortality experience for workers 5 through
35 years after onset of work. There were no direct asbestos or asbestos dust counts available for this facility. Although authors noted a single average ﬁber
count from 1971 within a similar factory, no other quantitative estimates of exposures were included within the analysis of this population, which reported
SMR"s across elapsed years since onset of work. Authors noted use of length of time worked in the amosite asbestos factory as a measure of asbestos
dosage.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Key elements of the study design were reported within this retrospective cohort study of
an initial group of n=933 males recruited to work at an amosite asbestos factory in Pa-
terson, New Jersey from June, 1941 through December, 1945 who were followed up for
mortality outcomes from ﬁve through 35 years after onset of work. Authors described
the population in the initial years as almost entirely white. Authors noted that n=113
men were excluded from analysis including n=20 with prior asbestos work. Additional
men with less than ﬁve years of employment were excluded due to leaving work to take
up asbestos work elsewhere (n=14), death in the ﬁrst ﬁve years of employment (n=41),
and loss to follow-up after leaving work in the ﬁrst ﬁve years of employment (n=38). A
total of n=820 male workers were left for the current analysis. The distributions of these
exclusions with respect to exposure and outcomes were not reported.
Metric 2: Attrition Medium Cause of death information was available for all n=528 deaths occurring after 5 years
from onset of asbestos work among the n=820 workers in the cohort for study. The
authors described a number of workers withdrawn alive at some time between 5 and
35 years of work to include n=5 men lost to follow-up, n=5 men who left the study site
work to work elsewhere, and n=155 men who had begun work 1943-1945 but who had
not yet attained their 35th year of observation by December 31, 1977. Exposure data for
participants was not obtained as the study authors noted use of length of time worked in
the amosite asbestos factory as the measure of asbestos dose with no measured exposure
estimates given for categories of years worked.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium The choice of a reference population is reported as the age- and year-speciﬁc white
male general New Jersey population for the SMR analyses results. There is potential
for healthy worker effect in terms of possible left truncation bias, as the cohort for the
current study was restricted to workers with at least ﬁve years of employment, such that
all workers had to survive for at least ﬁve years to be included.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Method of quantifying/counting ﬁbers was not speciﬁed.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Medium based on use of US PHS NIOSH data (collected via PCM ) for asbestos esti-
mates extrapolated from PA and TX plant. Some professional judgement exercised in
deriving estimates based on job function but estimates not solely based on judgement.
Metric 6: Temporality Medium The study presents an appropriate temporality and the interval between exposure and
outcome is appropriate considering the latency of disease.

data was reported for detailed cancer sites within Tables 3A and 3B, however SMR
analyses were not conducted for such detail. Authors noted the "all asbestos diseases"
category included asbestosis and other noninfectious pulmonary diseases, lung cancer,
mesotheliomas, cancers of the esophagus, stomach and colon-rectum, cancers of the
larynx, buccal cavity, pharynx and kidney. Mortality data for the worker population was
described as obtained through death certiﬁcate information only for some analyses, as
well as according to "best evidence" established from additional information obtained
from autopsy, surgical specimens, x-ray ﬁlms and clinical ﬁndings for other analyses.
ICD codes were not detailed, however authors noted that coding for the cause of death
was that of the VI through VIII revisions of the International List in use in the U.S. from
1949 onward. Data for the number of deaths by cause of death in the New Jersey general
white male population through 1975 was described as available through the annual
vital statistics publications, with additional data for 1976 obtained from the National
Center for Health Statistics. As mortality data for 1977 was not yet available, the study
authors extrapolated for 1977 the data from 1970-1976. Authors described additional
extrapolations necessary to account for the V to VI revision of the International List, as

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low The paper reported that the plant used chrysotile asbestos with low amphibole con-
tamination, and that exposure was assessed in 32 areas 4 times/year over a mean of 8h
(Casella air pump, Millipore AA ﬁlters). Fibers were "counted in 100 different optical
ﬁelds of ﬁlter surface" by "contrast phase microscope (x450)", limited to "ﬁbers with
length >5mm, diameter <3mm and length/diameter ratio 3/1" per EEC directive.
These data were used to calculate cumulative years and ﬁber-years of exposure for each
participant. The manuscript does not describe the use of detailed employment records to
estimate individual exposure.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Airborne asbestos ﬁber concentration was measured at 32 different points 4 times an-
nually. Exposure was highly variable. Median (IQR) ﬁbers/cm3 x years were 44.5
(15.6"66.6) and 54.7 (37.4"71.9) among living and deceased participants, respectively.
Exposure was treated continuously.
Additional Comments: This study analyzed mortality among 317 cement workers at a factory in Greece with low-level exposure to chrysotile asbestos. 52 deaths (16 lung cancer)
occurred between 1968 and 2006. SMRs vs the general population indicated decreased overall mortality, suggesting risk of a healthy worker effect (HWE)
bias. HRs showed no increase in mortality associated with ﬁber-years of exposure, and reduced mortality associated with greater years of exposure,
while smoking was associated with mortality. These ﬁndings led the researchers to postulate that the SMR of 1.7 for lung cancer was largely attributable to
smoking. However, failure to account for differential duration of employment - the tendency for earlier "selection of unhealthy people out of the workforce"
– recommended to reduce HWE bias, might also contribute to the absence of an association.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low The study or any cited methods source does not explicitly mention the use of PCM or

ing ﬁber concentration measures (since 1945) at asbestos mines (p. 847). Duration of
exposure was estimated based on numbers of shifts worked (280 shifts = 1 year), with
ﬁber-years calculated as duration X concentration. No details on methods used were
provided, but the precision and validity of pre-1975 measures are uncertain. (Sluis-
Cremer et al. 1990 RefID 3082523 indicates that konimeters and thermal precipitators
were used through 1975 when membrane ﬁlter methods were initiated). Fiber years be-
fore 1970 were estimated based on self-reported work histories; subsequent exposure
was continuously computed and updated every 6 months. One concern is the statement
that "In the earlier period if the total exposure of the man who left the mine amounted
to less than 500 ﬁbre-shifts the exposure was recorded as zero." It is not known if this
assumption was applied to any study participants, and if so to how many.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Sluis-Cremer et al. 1989 RefID 3082687: The exposure-outcome gradient was assessed
using continuous exposure measures that included: years of exposure prior to baseline,
years of exposure and ﬁber-years of exposure among those exposed after baseline (see
Table 4). Analyses were also stratiﬁed by any vs no exposure after baseline.
Additional Comments: This large prospective study examined whether asbestos exposure was associated with progression of irregular lung opacities in 1454 asbestos mine
workers (67% of participants in an earlier cross-sectional study). Participants had an x-ray taken as part of the baseline study and were identiﬁed as having
a subsequent x-ray a mean of 8-9 years later. Asbestos exposure before the baseline x-ray was associated with progression among workers regardless of
whether exposure was discontinued after that time. Exposure after the 1st x-ray was also associated with progression in the group with such exposure.
Indications for the 2nd x-ray, which was not conducted as part of this study, were not discussed. Given the long latency for asbestosis, is a potential concern
that in the follow-up time available, the analysis sample of men who had an indication for a follow-up x-ray may not be equally representative of lung
changes progressing relatively slowly vs relatively quickly.2/8/2023 UPDATE: DUE TO CHANGES IN THE GUIDANCE FOR SQE, ALL METRICS

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low The study or any cited methods source does not explicitly mention the use of PCM or
TEM.Exposure was quantiﬁed using available ﬁber measures and the duration of work
at each mine (primarily from annual worker interviews). Chronological exposures were
summed; average ﬁber-years were obtained dividing this sum by years of exposure.
Several sources of error are of concern. First, as measurement methods at the mines
changed over time, comparability and validity are uncertain, particularly before 1975
when membrane ﬁlter measures were initiated. Also, measurement intervals were gen-
erally 5-10 years prior to 1965, and subsequently 1-2 years. Second, for workers who
stopped mining prior to the start of annual interviewing in 1954, family members pro-
vided less reliable work histories. Finally, for smaller mines with limited data, industry
mean exposures were used. Details on temporal changes in ﬁber measurement methods
included: (i) 1940-1965 konimeter measures of particles <5mm and aspect ratio 2;
(ii) thermal precipitator (reported to undercount) measures from 1965-1970 of particles
>5mm and aspect ratio 3, then 1970-1975 of particles >3mm and maximum length
100mm; and (iii) the International Membrane Filter method from 1975 on (i.e. >5mm).
Unspeciﬁed conversion factors were used to improve comparability.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The exposure-outcome gradient was assessed using continuous exposure measures that
included: age at ﬁrst exposure, years of exposure, residence time in mining areas, av-
erage ﬁber concentration, and cumulative ﬁber-years of exposure. Fiber-years, average
ﬁber concentrations, and mining area residence time were also categorized for descrip-
tive analyses (Tables 4-6).
Additional Comments: This study analyzed associations between multiple measures of asbestos exposure and the probability of asbestosis identiﬁed post-mortem in lung tissue
among 807 S. African asbestos miners. The aim was to evaluate whether there appears to be a threshold dose below which asbestosis may not occur. The
authors found cases of asbestosis among miners exposed to concentrations as low as <=2 ﬁbers/mL (Table 5), and among subjects with >2-5 ﬁber-years
of cumulative exposure (Table 4). Dose-response estimates used continuous exposure variables; however, use of a stepwise algorithm to ﬁt those models
is a limitation.2/7/2023 UPDATE: DUE TO CHANGES IN THE GUIDANCE FOR SQE, ALL METRICS RATINGS EXCEPT FOR 4 AND 5 SHOULD
BE IGNORED BECAUSE METRIC 4 WAS RATED "LOW".
??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation
Including Legacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos , to be considered as being informative for dose-response analysis, Metrics 4 and 5 would need metric ratings of Medium
or High. This reference did not satisfy this requirement; therefore a data quality evaluation was not conducted.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low The authors highlight that the exposure data for both facilities is limited. No measure-
ments were taken at factory A, so no data is available. Factory B had annual dust mass
measurements from 1975-1993, and ﬁbers per milliliter were available for 1996-1998.
There was no discussion of the tools used to ascertain these measurements. There is a
discussion that preparation and handling of the asbestos products remained largely the
same over time, but there were improvements in ventilation.This metric is rated low be-
cause the study or any cited methods source does not explicitly mention the use of PCM
or TEM.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low There was no information available for exposure levels in factory A. The authors report
the dust concentrations of asbestos in factory B varied from 1.9-4.0 mg/m^ 3 for 1975-
89, and was 1.2-2.2 mg/m^ 3 from 1990-1993. In 1996-1998, the ﬁber concentration
showed the highest levels for workers who fed the mill with asbestos from sacks and for
those involved in sawing the end products. The exposure level for these two groups was
0.5-1.0 f/ml.
Additional Comments: There were several concerns with this paper. One that stood out was a lack of exposure measurements for one of the factories included in the study.
Another shortcoming was a lack of in-depth description of the analyses that they conducted. There was also a lack of discussion about potential co-
exposures participants may have faced. All of these issues contributed to a low conﬁdence rating.NOTE: Under the new guidance, this study would not
have undergone further evaluation because metric 4 was rated as low due to no explicit mention of PCM or TEM in this study or cited methods sources.
?No biomarkers were identiﬁed for this evaluation.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection High This is a retrospective case-control study of male rock and slag workers from seven
different factories who died of primary lung cancer between 1971 and 1994 (up to 1996
in Denmark). This study population makes up the European cohort of rock and slag
workers from Denmark, Germany, Norway and Sweden. Lung samples were taken from
30 lung cancer cases from the cohort. More details are reported in a previous paper
(Kj"rheim et al., 2002, HEROID: 6874042), where the original cohort size consisted of
9,174 men.
Metric 2: Attrition High Of the original 9,174 eligible workers in the cohort, this study only utilized 30 lung
samples from cases. Of those 30, 13 cases were deemed to be abnormal lung tissue and
were not sent for further pathology/ﬁbre analysis, adequately describing the reason why
those cases were excluded.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium This study did not describe the controls, but referenced a previous study (Kj"rheim et
al., 2002, HEROID: 6874042) where two control series were created and then combined
into one control group. Control series 1 consisted of male workers from the same fac-
tories who were alive and eligible in the cohort but had died before interviews. Control
series 2 consisted of incidence density-sampled controls matched to cases on plant and
date of birth.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Authors report that dust was extracted from lung tissue samples of cases using a F.E.I.
Technai 12 analytical transmission electron microscope (TEM). This was completed
only once/for one time period.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Authors used tertiles for duration of exposure (T1, T2, T3) and for cumulative exposure
(T1, T2, T3) for combined amosite and crocidolite concentration (per gram lung tissue *
10^ 6).
Metric 6: Temporality High Study consisted of male workers employed from start of production (between 1937 and
1950) until the end of 1976. Follow up occurred from 1971-1996 (1995 for Denmark),
presenting appropriate temporality between exposure and outcome.
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationMedium Lung Cancer: Lung cancer cases were conﬁrmed by International Classiﬁcation of Dis-
eases, 9th revision [ICD-9], codes (Kj"rheim et al., 2002, HEROID: 6874042). The
exact codes were not provided.

Metric 8: Reporting Bias Medium Findings are reported consistently throughout the paper and are extractable, but they
were not complete; Chrysotile and Tremolite concentrations per gram dry lung tissue X
10^ 6 were reported per sample but were not part of the odds ratios’ analyses.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment High Age, cigarette consumption, and time between end of exposure and lung sampling
(clearance time) were adjusted for in all models.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization High Authors collected questionnaire responses from relatives of cases and controls with
questions regarding demographic variables, residential history, general occupational
history, occupational history within the rock, slag and wool (RSW) companies, tobacco
smoking and alcohol drinking.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Medium Man-made vitreous ﬁbres (MMVF) are observed and analyzed in this paper alongside
asbestos. Authors address these ﬁbres separately and are adjusted for in their respective
models.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium This study uses an appropriate statistical method to address the relationship between the
lung asbestos ﬁbres and the variables of estimated exposure, with and without additional
variables that may affect ﬁbre retention in lung cancer cases (odds ratio).
Metric 13: Statistical Power Uninformative This case control study consisted of only 13 cases and controls. Authors mention in the
discussion section that this weakness resulted in low statistical power and highlighted
that a large pathology department had incinerated many of the eligible samples.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The description of the analysis is sufﬁcient to understand how to conceptually reproduce
the analysis with access to the analytic data.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium The models for calculating the odds ratios are transparent and authors described which
variables were included (except for the exclusion of Chrysotile and Tremolite).
Domain 6: Other (if applicable) Considerations for Biomarker Selection and Measurement (Lakind et al. 2014)
Metric 16: Use of Biomarker of Exposure Medium The biomarker is derived from multiple parent chemicals (MMVF, amosite, crocidolite,
chrysotile and tremolite)
Metric 17: Effect Biomarker Medium Thirteen lung tissue samples were used for ﬁbre analysis and ﬁbre burden with validated
methods, but an AOP is not clear.
Metric 18: Method Sensitivity Medium Authors report that "examination of the extracted dust preparationsdetermined ﬁbre type,
ﬁbre dimension and numbers of ﬁbres per gram of dry lung tissue. All ﬁbres detected
were included, irrespective of size. The limit of detection in all cases was 0.03 million
ﬁbres g^ -1 of dried tissue"

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Subjects were vermiculite miners, millers, and processors from a mine operating in
Libby, Montana. The authors specify that some subjects may have been "assigned jobs
in the screening plant, railroad loading dock, expansion plants, or an ofﬁce located in
the town of Libby (several miles from the mine)." The cohort was designed to include
all white males hired at Libby from September 1935 to December 1981, and the to-
tal cohort was identiﬁed in May 1982 and subjects were followed through December
2001. It is not clear exactly how subjects were recruited or identiﬁed, though it is im-
plied that the authors used data from an existing NIOSH database. Demographic data
was collected from a NIOSH database and then validated against microﬁlm company
records. One person originally identiﬁed (presumably from the NIOSH database) was
removed due to company records stating that the employee never actually worked. After
excluding 9 participants for missing demographic data, there were 1,871 study subjects.
However, after additional exclusions based on missing outcome data and to limit the
analysis sample to only white men, the ﬁnal analytic sample consisted of 1,672 workers
(Sullivan et al. 2007 HERO ID: 709497).Moolgavkar et al. 2010 (HERO ID: 709457)
used the same cohort as Sullivan et al. 2007 (HERO ID: 709497) but they also excluded
10 individuals who were missing vital status and thus resulted in a ﬁnal analytic sample
of 1,662. Bateson et al. 2010 (HERO ID: 2238712) used the same cohort data as Sulli-
van et al. 2007 (HERO ID: 709497), but do not appear to have made any exclusions for
missing data and do not appear to have limited their sample to only white men, resulting
in a ﬁnal sample of 1,871 subjects. However, they also analyzed a sub-cohort of workers
only hired after 12/31/1959 (n=880) to control for missing employment data in workers
hired earlier. The authors also followed up their participants through 12/31/2006, ﬁve
years longer than the other studies in this cohort.There is no evidence that the exposure-
outcome distribution of those included in these studies is different from those excluded.
Metric 2: Attrition High In Sullivan et al. 2007 (HERO ID: 709497), after 1,871 subjects were identiﬁed for
inclusion, 104 were excluded due to not being white males, and 95 were excluded due
to dying or being lost to follow-up before 1960. Prior to 1960 comparison rates for
asbestosis in NIOSH Life Table Analysis system were not available, requiring exclusion
from the analysis sample. In Moolgavkar et al. 2010 (HERO ID: 709457) an additional
10 participants were excluded due to missing vital status, although it is not clear how
these cases were handled in the original study. Bateson et al. 2014 (HERO ID: 2238712)
does not appear to have made any exclusions. There is overall a low rate of attrition and
it is unlikely to be inﬂuenced by both exposure and outcome.

Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium In Sullivan et al. 2007 (HERO ID: 709497) and Moolgavkar et al. 2010 (HERO ID:
709457) SMRs were calculated as the primary statistical analysis. Reference mortal-
ity rates were pulled from the NIOSH Life Table Analysis system. It is not speciﬁed
whether this reference population was the general US population or an occupational-
only population. Since the analysis samples only contained white males, there was
no need to adjust by race or sex. However, SMRs were adjusted for age at risk and
calendar-year of follow-up in Sullivan et al. 2007 (HERO ID: 709497). There is no dis-
cussion of other SMR adjustments in Moolgavkar et al. 2010 (HERO ID: 709457), but it
is possible that they used the same adjustment factors as Sullivan et al. 2007 (HERO ID:
709497), since the authors pulled the majority of their data from that study.Moolgavkar
et al. 2010 (HERO ID: 709457) also performed two regression analyses, one of which
was only reported to control for year of birth, and another for mesothelioma that did
not report any adjustments.Bateson et al. 2014 (HERO ID: 2238712) also conducted
a regression analysis and thus participants were compared to each other in statistical
analyses. Statistical analysis controlled for age, gender, race, and date of birth to ensure
comparisons were appropriate.

Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium In this cohort, all studies used the exact same method of assessing exposure through
quantiﬁcation using PCM and assignment to participants via a job-exposure matrix,
based on one used in an earlier NIOSH study (Amandus and Wheeler, 1987 HERO
ID: 29839). In Sullivan et al. 2007 (HERO ID: 709497) and Moolgavkar et al. 2010
(HERO ID: 709457) adjustments to the JEM were made, most notably to assign workers
with the "common laborer" job assignments or unknown job assignments the average
estimated exposure intensity for all unskilled jobs, as opposed to using the relatively
low exposure estimate for the mill yard in Libby. Thus, estimates of cumulative expo-
sure were higher in this cohort study than other studies using the same JEM. Obtaining
work histories for these studies resulted in additional jobs that were not detailed in the
original NIOSH JEM. Exposure estimates for these jobs and corresponding calendar
periods were extrapolated based on review of exposure records from other studies of
Libby workers and professional judgment. Work history to assign exposure was gath-
ered from a NIOSH database created in the 1980"s and was validated against microﬁlm
company records. The authors do not specify how many samples were analyzed for use
in the JEM. In statistical analysis results were presented in terms of cumulative exposure
(ﬁber/cc-years).The authors in Bateson et al. 2014 (HERO ID: 2238712) used the same
exposure data as the other studies in this cohort, but they were concerned about poten-
tial exposure misclassiﬁcation due to the missing job data indicated in the Sullivan et
al. 2007 (HERO ID: 709497) study, which was originally compensated for by assign-
ing them the average level of exposure. The authors in Bateson et al. 2014 (HERO ID:
2238712) noted that most workers missing job data were hired before 1960, and thus
analyzed both the full cohort and only those hired after 12/31/1959 to address this issue.
The authors also reported residence-time-weighted exposure, which is a metric that pro-
vides additional weight to earlier exposure. In statistical analysis results were presented
in terms of cumulative exposure (ﬁber/cc-years).
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium All studies in the cohort have an adequate distribution of exposure to detect an effect.
All studies report at least three levels of exposure or use a continuous model of exposure
in their SMR analyses.
Metric 6: Temporality High In all studies there was a minimum of 20 years of follow-up since a participant"s ﬁrst
exposure, and the workers hired earliest had >65 years of prior exposure data since the
study was designed to capture those employed between 1935 and 1981.

Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationMedium Lung Cancer: Vital status was determined through 2001 by the National Death Index
resources, the Social Security Administration resources, the internet (Ancestry.com;
RootsWeb.com, and electronic links to state death records). And a tracking service.
Workers found to be alive on or after 1/1/1979, when the National Death Index tracking
began, but not found in the Index, were assumed to be alive as of 12/31/2001. Vital sta-
tus follow-up was successful for 97.8% of the cohort. While some of the resources have
a high degree of certainty, others such as the internet-based resources are of questionable
quality. There is no explanation of what percentage each resource was used to ascertain
vital status, but the more reliable method such as National Death Index are likely to be
more informative and thus used more often. Thus, while there is some uncertainty that
the vital status ascertainment was fully accurate, it is unlikely that a signiﬁcant num-
ber of participants would have their vital status changed or that this would be related to
their exposure status. Additionally, Bateson et al. 2014 (HERO ID: 2238712) report that
all outcome data was retrieved from the National Death Index.For 97% of the partici-
pants known to be deceased, exact cause of death was pulled from death certiﬁcates and
coded using the ICD codes relevant at the time of death, ranging from ICD-8 to ICD-
10. Deaths prior to 1979 were coded by a single National Center for Health Statistics-
trained nosologist; after 1979 ICD codes were obtained from the National Death Index.
Final results present ICD-9 codes, so it can be assumed that all codes were converted to
that system, although their methodology is not explained.ICD-9 code 162 was reported
for lung cancer.; Asbestosis: Vital status was determined through 2001 by the National

for Health Statistics-trained nosologist; after 1979 ICD codes were obtained from the
National Death Index. Final results present ICD-9 codes, so it can be assumed that all
codes were converted to that system, although their methodology is not explained.ICD-9
code 151 was reported for asbestosis.; Other Non-Cancer Outcomes: Vital status was
determined through 2001 by the National Death Index resources, the Social Security Ad-
ministration resources, the internet (Ancestry.com; RootsWeb.com, and electronic links
to state death records). And a tracking service. Workers found to be alive on or after 1/
1/1979, when the National Death Index tracking began, but not found in the Index, were
assumed to be alive as of 12/31/2001. Vital status follow-up was successful for 97.8% of
the cohort. While some of the resources have a high degree of certainty, others such as
the internet-based resources are of questionable quality. There is no explanation of what
percentage each resource was used to ascertain vital status, but the more reliable method
such as National Death Index are likely to be more informative and thus used more of-
ten. Thus, while there is some uncertainty that the vital status ascertainment was fully
accurate, it is unlikely that a signiﬁcant number of participants would have their vital
status changed or that this would be related to their exposure status. Additionally, Bate-
son et al. 2014 (HERO ID: 2238712) report that all outcome data was retrieved from the
National Death Index.For 97% of the participants known to be deceased, exact cause of
death was pulled from death certiﬁcates and coded using the ICD codes relevant at the
time of death, ranging from ICD-8 to ICD-10. Deaths prior to 1979 were coded by a sin-
gle National Center for Health Statistics-trained nosologist; after 1979 ICD codes were
obtained from the National Death Index. Final results present ICD-9 codes, so it can be
assumed that all codes were converted to that system, although their methodology is not
explained.ICD-9 codes 460-519 were reported for nonmalignant respiratory disease.

Domain Metric Rating Comments
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High All stated outcomes are reported in the results.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium In both Sullivan et al. 2007 (HERO ID: 709497) and Moolgavkar et al. 2010 (HERO ID:
709457) SMRs were calculated and the sample only included white males, so there was
no need to adjust for race and gender. While Sullivan et al. 2007 (HERO ID: 709497)
state that they also adjusted for age at risk and calendar year of follow-up, there is no
discussion of other SMR adjustments in Moolgavkar et al. 2010 (HERO ID: 709457). It
is unlikely that they did not adjust for age, but this cannot be assumed. Moolgavkar et al.
2010 (HERO ID: 709457) also performed a Cox proportional hazards model analysis
in which they adjusted for year of birth. They state that they used year of birth as a
"rough surrogate" for smoking habits as well, which is not a sufﬁcient consideration for
smoking. Bateson et al. 2014 (HERO ID: 2238712) also performed a Cox proportional
hazards model, and adjustments were made for gender, race, date of birth, and age. This
metric would be rated as "Low" for lung cancer-related outcomes if the only analyses
were regression analyses due to the lack of formal adjustment for smoking habits.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium All covariate information was obtained from the NIOSH database and cross-checked
against microﬁlmed company records.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low In this occupational setting, no co-exposures are adjusted for. Sullivan et al. 2007
(HERO ID: 709497) notes that there was insufﬁcient data to estimate exposure to other
contaminants such as diesel particulate generated by mine machinery, or exposure to
silica.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The use of SMRs and regression analyses to understand the long-term impact of as-
bestos exposure on mortality is appropriate. The use of a cohort design is also appropri-
ate to assess outcomes with a long latency such as lung cancer.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The number of participants used in the analysis sample varies by study, but is always
sufﬁciently large to detect an effect. Sullivan et al. 2007 (HERO ID: 709497) had a ﬁnal
analysis sample of 1,672; Moolgavkar et al. 2010 (HERO ID: 709457) had a ﬁnal anal-
ysis sample of 1,662; and Bateson et al. 2014 (HERO ID: 2238712) had a ﬁnal analysis
sample of 1,871 and sub-cohort samples of 991 and 890. There is not a signiﬁcant dis-
cussion of power, but Sullivan et al. 2007 (HERO ID: 709497) states that the study has
low power for lung cancer outcomes at lower exposure levels.

Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium While several details are not explained in detail, such as how the ICD-8 through ICD-10
codes were converted to ICD-9 codes, overall the descriptions of methods across the
cohort are detailed enough that it would be possible to reproduce the results given access
to the analytic data.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium While there is no formal discussion of assumptions in statistical models in both Sullivan
et al. 2007 (HERO ID: 709497) and Bateson et al. 2014 (HERO ID: 2238712, there
are no assumptions in SMR or Cox proportional hazards model that would reasonably
expect to be unmet. Moolgavkar et al. 2010 (HERO ID: 709457) contains those same
analyses without a formal discussion of assumptions, but also analyses mesothelioma
using a maximum likelihood equation in which they assume a Poisson distribution.
Additional Comments: In these cohort studies of Libby, Montana employees exposure was measured via PCM and assigned using a JEM. Participants were followed up for a
minimum of 20 years from ﬁrst exposure, and mortality outcomes were examined in relation to asbestos exposure through SMR and regression analysis.
While there is some potential for outcome and exposure misclassiﬁcation, the impact of potential misclassiﬁcation is unlikely to signiﬁcantly bias the
results of the cohort. Signiﬁcant effects were found for most outcomes, in particular asbestosis and lung cancer.The measurement exposure (M4) and/or
exposure levels (M5) metrics are rated as medium upon review by both set of reviewers. Also, the overall quality determination (OQD) is rated medium.
Extraction has been completed and quality control reviewed.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium In this cohort, all studies used the exact same method of assessing exposure through
quantiﬁcation using PCM and assignment to participants via a job-exposure matrix,
based on one used in an earlier NIOSH study (Amandus and Wheeler, 1987 HERO ID:
29839). In Sullivan et al. 2007 (HERO ID: 709497) and Moolgavkar et al. 2010 (HERO
ID: 709457) adjustments to the JEM were made, most notably to assign workers with
the "common laborer" job assignments or unknown job assignments the average esti-
mated exposure intensity for all unskilled jobs, as opposed to using the relatively low
exposure estimate for the mill yard in Libby. Thus, estimates of cumulative exposure
were higher in this cohort study than other studies using the same JEM. Additionally,
obtaining work histories for these studies resulted in additional jobs that were not de-
tailed in the original NIOSH JEM. Exposure estimates for these jobs and corresponding
calendar periods were extrapolated based on review of exposure records from other stud-
ies of Libby workers and professional judgment. Work history to assign exposure was
gathered from a NIOSH database created in the 1980"s and was validated against mi-
croﬁlm company records. The authors do not specify how many samples were analyzed
for use in the JEM. In statistical analysis results were presented in terms of cumula-
tive exposure (ﬁber/cc-years).The authors in Bateson et al. 2014 (HERO ID: 2238712)
were concerned about potential exposure misclassiﬁcation due to the missing job data
indicated in the Sullivan et al. 2007 study, which was originally compensated for by as-
signing them the average level of exposure. The authors in Bateson et al. 2014 (HERO
ID: 2238712) noted that most workers missing job data were hired before 1960, and thus
analyzed both the full cohort and only those hired after 12/31/1959 to address this issue.
The authors also reported residence-time-weighted exposure, which is a metric that pro-
vides additional weight to earlier exposure. In statistical analysis results were presented
in terms of cumulative exposure (ﬁber/cc-years).
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low All outcome evaluated in this form were only analyzed as "unexposed vs, exposed", thus
limting their usefulness in dose-response analysis.
Additional Comments: The outcomes in this evaluation did not meet the criteria for dose-response analysis due to a "Low" rating for Metric 5.
??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation
Including Legacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos , to be considered as being informative for dose-response analysis, Metrics 4 and 5 would need metric ratings of Medium
or High. This reference did not satisfy this requirement; therefore a data quality evaluation was not conducted.

the authors used weighted asbestos concentrations to assessing exposures; they did not provide details about the methods and equipment used to generate
these values. On the other hand, they used ICD-9 codes to ascertain health and mortality outcomes.While information on the measurement of exposure
metric (M4) to assess exposure was limited or rated low. The exposure levels metric (M5) information reported was adequate or rated medium to determine

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium Some key elements of the study design were not present but available information indi-
cates a low risk of selection bias. All workers were employed at an asbestos mining and
milling company based in Brazil. Participants had worked at the company for at least
a year (Bagatin et al., 2005 RefID 2078960). To capture the development of asbestos
mining and milling in the country, four groups were created from different time peri-
ods: Group 1 taking place in 1940-1966, Group 2 in 1967-1976, Group 3 in 1977-1980,
and Group 4 taking place after 1981. All groups were exposed to chrysotile and Group
1 was also exposed to tremolite. Characteristics such as gender, age, time of exposure,
smoking, and mean spirometry measures are provided in Table 1. Exclusion criteria are
not known. While recruitment methods aren"t clear, Bagatin et al., 2005 RefID 2078960
stated a four-year "multi-institutional effort, which included local municipalities and
union workers, was responsible for recruiting the subjects who participated in the study."
Metric 2: Attrition High This study reports cross-sectional retrospective data and thus subject withdrawal from
the study is not of concern. Outcome and exposure data appear to be complete.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium Differences in SES or race/ethnicity are plausible given that the groups represent two
different regions of Brazil (Bahia and Goias) but not provided in the study. Nonethe-
less, all subjects appear to be recruited from the same eligible population and appear
to be similar. Healthy worker effect may be of concern due to spirometric values being
compared to predicted values of the adult Brazilian population.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure High For Groups 3 and 4 (after 1976), airborne samples from occupational settings were
routinely collected via a constant-ﬂow sampler, followed by a membrane ﬁlter to collect
ﬁbers and PCM to count ﬁbers.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The range and distribution of exposure was sufﬁcient to develop and exposure-response
estimate. Mean cumulative exposure for groups were: "Group I: 110.9 140.3 ﬁbres-
cc-years; Group II: 44.1 49.4 ﬁbres-cc-years; Group III: 7.6 5.4 ﬁbres-cc-years;

Metric 6: Temporality Medium The longitudinal analysis conducted in the study established temporality but adequate
follow-up is unclear. 301 subjects who were free of any asbestos-related abnormalities
were ﬁrst evaluated in 1997-2000 and then reevaluated in 2007-2010 which seems to
imply a 10-year latency period, though it"s not clear if a subject evaluated in 2000 and
would"ve been reevaluated in 2007 (i.e. 7-year latency which is grounds for "Low"). For
the cross-sectional data, temporality is unclear. Although exposure measurements are
retrospective, it is unclear, if signs of adverse health outcomes preceded exposure as the
health history of these workers at the beginning of employment is not available.
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationHigh Asbestosis: Determined by two independent thoracic radiologists who knew about sub-
jects" exposure to asbestos but were blinded to other demographic and lung function
characteristics. Readers assessed different kinds of pulmonary abnormalities via Thin-
section computed tomography (CT) images to determine if they were or not "deﬁnitely-
indicative" of lung ﬁbrosis compatible with asbestosis.; Pulmonary Function/Spirometry
Results: FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, and forced expiratory ﬂow between 25% and
75% of FVC (FEF25-75% ) were measured using a calibrated pneumotachograph in
Multispiro System.; Pleural Plaques: Through chest radiography (CXR), pleural plaques
were determined by three blinded radiologists who followed ILO standards for classi-
ﬁcation. Through Thin-section CT scans (via X-vision scanner), pleural plaques were
assessed by two independent thoracic radiologists who knew about subjects" exposure
to asbestos but were blinded to other demographic and lung function characteristics.
Presence of pleural plaques was determined if the follow pleural abnormality was found:
"circumscribedquadrangular pleural elevation with sharp borders and soft tissue density,
possibly calciﬁed, in typical posterolateral and anterolateral location."; Other Non-
Cancer Outcomes: Through chest radiography (CXR), interstitial abnormalities were
determined by three blinded radiologists who followed ILO standards for classiﬁcation.
Through Thin-section CT scans (via X-vision scanner), interstitial abnormalities were
assessed by two independent thoracic radiologists who knew about subjects" exposure to

Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment Medium Authors mentioned that confounders were controlled for in logistic regression analyses,
but the exact variables considered as confounding are not speciﬁed. Knowing the exact
confounding variables is critical given that the groups represent different regions of
Brazil, which is known to be a culturally-diverse country. Table 4 presents smoking
adjusted estimates for lung function are provided.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium As an occupational study, it can be assumed that covariate data were collected from
personnel records. Information on gender, age, time of exposure, smoking history, and
mean spirometric test values are provided in Table 1.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Low Co-exposures were not explicitly assessed. Although subjects came from an asbestos
mining and milling company, co-exposures may be likely for workers present prior
to 1976 where no formal ﬁber counting method was established yet. In the cases of
asbestosis, the etiology of asbestosis rules out other potential co-exposures.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The study design was appropriate to address the research question. Kolmogorov-
Smirnov test was used to test for normality. "Categorical variables were tested using
the chi-squared or Fisher exact tests. Continuous variables were compared with analysis
of variance (ANOV A) or Kruskal-Wallis test, with Bonferroni correction for multiple
comparisons." Additionally, Poisson regression models were used for the longitudinal
analyses.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium The number of participants (n = 1418) seemed adequate to detect an effect in all groups
(n= 123, 600, 479, 216). The case-control study had small sample sizes (cases = 73;
controls = 21).
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The description of the analyses is sufﬁcient to understand how to conceptually reproduce
the analysis with access to the analytic data.
Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Low Description of assumptions made in the models are not provided.
Additional Comments: Prior to 1976, no formal ﬁber measurement was used. As a result, a subjective, logarithmic scale was used to estimate levels in groups 1 and 2. Exposure
estimates in Groups 1 and 2 may not be reliable due to the lack of a formal ﬁber counting method during the time frames of each group.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low The authors did not specify the method for quantifying ﬁbers so it is unknown whether
PCM, TEM, or another microscopy method was used, but exposure was quantiﬁed in
ﬁber-years/ml. Fiber measurements from 1970-1985 were obtained by static sampling
during peak installation activities, which the authors noted may have contributed to
overestimations. Measurements after 1985 were obtained by personal monitoring that
measured 8-h time-weighted personal exposures, which likely better captured true expo-
sures.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium There was a sufﬁciently wide range and distribution of exposure. The study used a con-
tinuous measurement of cumulative asbestos exposure with estimates ranging from 16.4
to 98.7 ﬁber-years/ml with a mean of 26.3 +/- 12.6 ﬁber-years/ml. However, there was
no statistically signiﬁcant association between cumulative asbestos exposure and pleural
plaque surface area.
Additional Comments: QC was not completed for metrics other than Metrics 4 and 5 because the study does not have sufﬁcient exposure information to be useful for dose-response
analysis. Metric 4 was rated Low because the method for quantifying ﬁbers was not speciﬁed. The authors did not specify the method for quantifying ﬁbers
so it is unknown whether PCM, TEM, or another microscopy method was used, but exposure was quantiﬁed in ﬁber-years/ml, which could potentially be
useful. However, the study assessed the association between past asbestos exposure and the size (rather than the prevalence) of pleural plaques, and found
no statistically signiﬁcant association. The study also assessed the association between pleural plaque size (rather than asbestos exposure) and pulmonary
function. Thus, the study does not have sufﬁcient information for dose-response quantiﬁcation for the association between asbestos exposure and the
prevalence of pleural plaques or pulmonary function levels.
?No biomarkers were identiﬁed for this evaluation.
??As described in Appendix B of the White Paper: Quantitative Approach to the Human Health Assessment for the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2 – Supplemental Evaluation
Including Legacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos , to be considered as being informative for dose-response analysis, Metrics 4 and 5 would need metric ratings of Medium
or High. This reference did not satisfy this requirement; therefore a data quality evaluation was not conducted.

Domain 6: Other (if applicable) Considerations for Biomarker Selection and Measurement (Lakind et al. 2014)
Metric 16: Use of Biomarker of Exposure Low 7 of 76 saliva specimens were not analyzed because of technical difﬁculties, therefore
69 samples were analyzed. 9 of 69 had atypical ferruginous bodies not exceeding 4 per

Metric 18: Method Sensitivity Low LOD/LOQ were not reported.
Metric 19: Biomarker Stability Low The authors did not report a speciﬁed storage history of the sputum samples.
Metric 20: Sample Contamination Low Contamination or lack thereof of samples was not reported. There is no use or docu-
mentation of the steps taken to provide the necessary assurance that the study data is
reliable.
Metric 21: Method Requirements Medium Samples were "digested and then ﬁltered to count the typical and atypical ferruglnous
bodies by light microscopy EH 300 x magniﬁcation." It is unclear if the method has
known interferants.
Metric 22: Matrix Adjustment Low No established method for matrix adjustment was conducted for sputum samples.
Additional Comments: Did not extract data related to malignant neoplasm deaths as we aren"t extracting data on cancer. Analyzed outcomes of radiology and mortality in separate
forms, as the methodology was different for the radiology vs. mortality outcomes. Study analyzes deaths by race (black and white). Radiology groups
involved 68 employees who were ﬁlmed (total of 83 ﬁlms across participants), 25 ﬁlms taken from employees in another division of the company who were
"not believed to have been exposed to dust", and 25 ﬁlms from Montana mine selected at random from men with and without parenchymal small opacities.
Did not select libby amphibole since South Carolina would likely not be considered close to Libby MT. Did not extract any data on cancer (including for
mortality results) but did mark them since they were addressed in the paper in the extraction form.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium This prospective occupational study examined the health effects of asbestos exposure
among a group of workers from an asbestos textile factory in China. Male workers were
included in the study if they were registered workers in the factory on January 1972 and
did not have signs of malignant tumors. Follow up continued through 2008. 586 workers
were recruited for the original cohort, and 577 workers remained through the follow
up period (98.5% participation rate at ﬁnal follow up). While the study authors boast a
high participation rate, it is unclear what percentage of the total eligible workers were
initially recruited in 1972..
Metric 2: Attrition High This study had a participation rate of 98.5% at the ﬁnal follow up, a high rate that mini-
mizes concerns about bias introduced via subject attrition. Analyses were limited to the
577 subjects that had complete follow up information. Outcome and exposure data were
complete for study subjects.
Metric 3: Comparison Group High Authors provide a description of comparisons between the three exposure groups and
noted differences in age, exposure duration, and smoking in the three groups. These
variables were included as cofounders in Cox proportional hazard models, thus effec-
tively controlling for the differences between the groups.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Asbestos levels in the factory were quantitatively measured via TEM in 1982 and 2006,
with an assertion that levels remained over 2 mg/m^ 3 during the study period. Personal
sampling was conducted to assess the levels in different areas of the factory, which
was ultimately used to construct three exposure groups (high, medium, low). Authors
note that 70% of the workers had stable positions in the factory for the duration of the
study. These positions were used to place workers into exposure categories. While these
exposure estimates were based on quantitative measures and the role in the factory,
there is still potential for nondifferential misclassiﬁcation of exposure due to the limited
quantitative measuring and the lack of speciﬁcity about those who did have varying roles
during their employment.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Exposure categories were high, medium, and low, based on the job description of work-
ers and sampling results from the factory. The low category was used as a reference
group for comparison purposes.

cies during recruitment. This is an appropriate timeframe to assess lung cancer or other
outcomes of interest.
Domain 3: Outcome Assessment
Metric 7: Outcome Measurement or
CharacterizationMedium Lung Cancer: Lung cancer deaths were identiﬁed through personnel records from the
factory. There is no indication that ICD codes were used to identify cases. Authors note
that half of the cases were conﬁrmed pathologically, though because half of the cases
were not conﬁrmed, this domain was rated medium.; Asbestosis: Asbestosis deaths were
also ascertained through personnel records from the factory. There is no indication that
ICD codes or lung tissue scarring were used to identify cases.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High Hazard ratios and 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI) were reported for lung cancer and
asbestosis mortality. Cases for each exposure category were reported in a separate table.
While these numbers were not reported directly in the results table, there is enough
information to merit a high rating.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment High The study authors appropriately adjusted for variables that vary among the three expo-
sure groups. Age, duration of exposure, and smoking were included as covariates in Cox
proportional hazard models.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization Medium Data on covariates was collected from factory records. Additionally, smoking informa-
tion was collected from individuals via interview or from family members via interview.
There was no indication of validation of factory records, though the records can be as-
sumed to be fairly accurate.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Medium This study took place in an asbestos textile factory. There is no indication that co-
exposures were present in the occupational setting.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium This study used a prospective cohort design to assess lung cancer mortality, which has a
long latency period. This is an appropriate design for this health outcome. Additionally,
Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare the medium and high exposure
groups to the low exposure group (referent).
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium While the overall cohort numbers are appropriate, there are concerns about the statistical
power of the model to assess lung cancer and asbestosis. While some the low exposure
group had less than 10 subjects, the effect estimates presented appear to be robust for
these two outcomes.

Additional Comments: For the lung cancer and asbestosis assessments, there are a limited number of cases across the exposure categories. For the low exposure category, <10
cases were present, which limits the statistical power of the analysis and brings into question the ability of the study to detect an effect. Otherwise, the
study presents appropriate approaches to participant selection, exposure assessment, and control for potential confounders.The measurement exposure

Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Medium This study took place in an asbestos textile factory. There is no indication that co-

Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium This study used a prospective cohort design to assess gastrointestinal cancer mortality,
which has a long latency period. This is an appropriate design for this health outcome.
Additionally a Cox proportional hazard model was used to compare the medium and
high exposure groups to the low exposure group (referent).
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium While the overall cohort numbers are appropriate, there are concerns about the statistical
power of the model to assess gastrointestinal cancer. Two exposure categories (low and
high) have less than 10 subjects, which could limit the ability to detect robust effect
estimates.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium Overall, adequate information was provided to conceptually reproduce the analyses

Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Low While the model to assess the hazard of gastrointestinal cancer mortality is clear, it
is unclear if Cox proportional hazard model assumptions were met. Authors did not
discuss any tests to assess the appropriateness of the statistical model.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium This prospective occupational study examined the health effects of asbestos exposure
among a group of workers from an asbestos textile factory in China. Male workers were
included in the study if they were registered workers in the factory on January 1972
and did not have signs of malignant tumors. Follow up continued through 2008. 586
workers were recruited for the original cohort, and 577 workers remained through the
follow up period (98.5% participation rate at ﬁnal follow up). While the study boasts a
high participation rate, it is unclear what percentage of the total eligible workers were
initially recruited in 1972, preventing a high rating in this domain.
Metric 2: Attrition High This study had a participation rate of 98.5% at the ﬁnal follow up, a high rate that mini-
mizes concerns about bias introduced via subject attrition. Analyses were limited to the
577 subjects that had complete follow up information. Outcome and exposure data are
complete for study subjects.
Metric 3: Comparison Group High Authors provide a description of comparisons between the three exposure groups and
noted differences in age, exposure duration, and smoking in the three groups. These
variables were included as cofounders in Cox proportional hazard models, thus effec-
tively controlling for the differences between the groups.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Asbestos levels in the factory were quantitatively measured via TEM in 1982 and 2006,
with an assertion that levels remained over 2 mg/m^ 3 during the study period. Personal
sampling was conducted to assess the levels in different areas of the factory, which
was ultimately used to construct three exposure groups (high, medium, low). Authors
note that 70% of the workers had stable positions in the factory for the duration of the
study. These positions were used to place workers into exposure categories. While these
exposure estimates were based on quantitative measures and the role in the factory,
there is still potential for nondifferential misclassiﬁcation of exposure due to the limited
quantitative measuring and the lack of speciﬁcity about those who did have varying roles
during their employment.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Exposure categories were high, medium, and low, based on the job description of work-
ers and sampling results from the factory.
Metric 6: Temporality High This study has over 30 years of follow-up, and subjects did not have signs of malig-
nancies during recruitment. This is an appropriate timeframe to assess nonmalignant
respiratory disease and sufﬁciently accounts for temporality.

tained through personnel records from the factory. There is no indication that ICD codes
were used to identify cases or that all death certiﬁcate ﬁelds were searched to identify
cases.
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High Hazard ratios and 95% CI are reported for nonmalignant respiratory mortality. Cases
for each exposure category are reported in a separate table. While these numbers are not
reported directly in the results table, there is enough information to merit a high rating.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Medium Asbestos dust concentrations in the mine were described as measured periodically for
total dust with available data up to 1995 brieﬂy summarized in the text. Additional ﬁx-
ing point sampling in various workshops in 2006 with 28 breathing-zone samples in
eight workshops collected and analyzed in accordance with HSE Methods (HSE 2000)
was also brieﬂy summarized. Conversion factors were applied to the dust measurements
in 2006 with resulting average 2006 ﬁber concentration in the mine reported as 29.0
f/mL (range: 2.9 to 63.8 f/mL). However, side-by-side sampling and analysis were not
noted.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low The data to develop adquate exposure-response relationships is limited.
Additional Comments: This retrospective cohort study examined the association between asbestos exposure and cause-speciﬁc mortality in a cohort of chrysotile asbestos miners
in China 1981-2006. A total of n=1,539 male mine workers, with n=1,080 mining ("miner and miller group" composed of those directly engaged in
asbestos mining and milling, mechanical maintenance and transportation) workers and n=459 controls (administrative management, ofﬁce work, cooks)
were included for study. Authors noted workers were followed up 1981 through 2006 "irrespective of retirement status", however it was unclear if workers
were followed who might have left the mine prior to the retirement. Average dust and ﬁber/mL exposure was brieﬂy detailed within text for the overall
population, but not speciﬁc populations within results or utilized within SMR or Cox regression results. However Cox regression utilized length of
follow-up as the time dimension, while taking into account employment years. Authors noted that control workers were exposed to asbestos, and control
worker SMR of nonmalignant respiratory disease was 85% greater than expected, although had mortality rates similar to national rates for other causes.
All mortality rates of selected causes were substantially higher in the miner group than in the controls. The authors reported SMR"s of nonmalignant
respiratory diseases in the miners as 3.53 (2.78, 4.48), and noted that asbestos exposure was related to over a threefold risk for respiratory diseases and all
cancers, while adjusting for smoking and age.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low Asbestos analytic method for data within the FINJEM was not speciﬁed. Methods used
to quantify the exposure were not well deﬁned, and sources of data and detailed methods
of exposure assessment were not reported. Asbestos exposure was deﬁned in models as
the product of probability and exposure level obtained from data from the Finnish na-
tional job exposure matrix (FINJEM) developed at the Finnish Institute of Occupational
Health, which included data described as estimates based on professional judgment and
derived from industrial hygiene measurements when available 1960-1984. Details of
analytical method (PCM/TEM) for asbestos samples were not provided within the main
text or the referenced article by Kauppinen et al., 1998 (HERO ID not available). Ad-
ditional searches regarding FINJEM data analytical methods located Kauppinen et al.,
2013 (HERO ID 2634525), which noted levels of chemical exposures in FINJEM were
determined by experienced IH’s using "...data from the Database of Occupational Ex-
posure Measurements (DOEM) (Kauppinen, 2001; Heikkil" et al., 2005; Saalo et al.,
2010), the Register of Employees Exposed to Carcinogens (ASA) (Kauppinen et al.,
2007; Saalo et al., 2011), and the Finnish Work and Health Surveys (Perki"-M"kel" et
al., 2010)". Checking for information on the DOEM, Kauppinen et al., 2014 (HERO ID
6735112) "Use of the Finnish Information System on Occupational Exposure (FINJEM)
in epidemiologic, surveillance, and other applications" was found which also did not
detail asbestos sampling and analytic methods.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Low The range and distribution of exposure was described only as subdivided into three
factored categories for each agent: zero; low (roughly below median among job titles
with exposure probability .0); and medium/high. Measured levels were not summarized.
Additional Comments: Weiderpass et al., 1999 (HERO ID 730085) was not evaluated for any metrics except Metric 4 and 5 as it did not have sufﬁcient exposure information to
be useful for dose-response analysis.

Domain 1: Study Participation
Metric 1: Participant Selection Medium This study focuses on a cohort of 5645 men across two asbestos cement building ma-
terials plants New Orleans, LA who had at least 20 years of follow-up available. 35%
worked at the ﬁrst plant (rooﬁng products), 64% worked at the second plant (rooﬁng,
piping, and ﬂooring products), and 1% worked at both plants with a similar distribution
of lengths of employment in both plants however a greater proportion of workers in the
second plant were employed for more than 20 years. No recruitment methods were or
other inclusion or exclusion criteria were described.
Metric 2: Attrition Medium The study authors were able to conﬁrm that 11% of the cohort were known to have died
and that approximately 64% were known to be alive in 1974 however for the remaining
25% were unable to be traced and the authors stated analysis adjustments were not pos-
sible for this group. These primarily would have been subjects between 45 an 64 years
of age in 1974. Based on subsequent discussion and review of additional information,
the rating was adjusted based on adequately addressed is from either imputation or if
there aren"t differences between groups in terms of reasons for loss.
Metric 3: Comparison Group Medium The subjects were categorized into 5 exposure categories and mean follow-up and mean
age at initial exposure were similar across the groups however no statement was pro-
vided about the distribution of age across the exposure groups. SMR analysis was con-
ducted on the basis of race-age-cause speciﬁc rates for both the U.S. and for Louisiana
male populations for 1950, 1960, and 1970.
Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure High Hammad et al. 1979 details the sampling data collected and the determination of as-
bestos ﬁber measurements in the samples. Impinger ﬁlter pairs were collected from
personal samples. Asbestos ﬁbers were counted on ﬁlter samples using PCM. Paired
samples were collected for various job functions or "zones".
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Table 1 and 2 in the publication present 5 different exposure levels, including SMRs in
Table 2. Table 3-25 in the 1986 assessment presents SMRs and RRs for the 5 exposure
groups.
Metric 6: Temporality High The study presents appropriate temporality between exposure and outcome, with all
workers having >=20 years of follow up.

ing to ICD-8 codes ( all malignant neoplasms: 140-209; digestive system neoplasms:
150-159).; Other Non-Cancer Outcomes: High - Death certiﬁcates were coded by a
nosologist with the U.S. Public Heatlh Service according to ICD-8 codes (cardiovascular
diseases: 390-448).
Metric 8: Reporting Bias High Findings of SMR and OR analyses are reported with case numbers.
Domain 4: Potential Confounding / Variability Control
Metric 9: Covariate Adjustment High SMR analysis was conducted on the basis of race-age-cause speciﬁc rates for both the
U.S. and for Louisiana male populations for 1950, 1960, and 1970.
Metric 10: Covariate Characterization High The study assessed age and sex and these are assumed to have been obtained from per-
sonnel records. Assessment of SES was not described however this is unlikely to intro-
duce bias as the exposure was based on job history and it is assumed that the workers in
the asbestos cement building materials plants have similar SES.
Metric 11: Co-exposure Counfounding Medium Co-exposures are not discussed in detail, but authors note the use of silica in plants and
there is no direct evidence for an unbalanced provision of additional co-exposure across
study groups.
Domain 5: Analysis
Metric 12: Study Design and Methods Medium The cohort study design is appropriate for the analysis of SMR by asbestos dust expo-
sure categories. Further analysis utilized a matched case-control design for lung cancer
cases that were assigned 4 controls matched on same birth year, race, survived into the
same year as the case, and did not subsequently die to a malignancy.
Metric 13: Statistical Power Medium There is adequate power to detect an association in this study, which utilized 5645 male
subjects with at least 20 years of follow-up. Of these subjects, 11% were known to have
died.
Metric 14: Reproducibility of Analyses Medium The description of the analysis is sufﬁcient to understand how to conceptually reproduce
the analysis with access to the data and the U.S. and Louisiana race-age-cause-speciﬁc
mortality rates.

Metric 15: Statistical Analysis Medium The method for calculating the SMR is transparently reported as in the study. Further
analysis utilized a matched case-control design for lung cancer cases that were assigned
4 controls matched on same birth year, race, survived into the same year as the case, and
did not subsequently die to a malignancy. There are no explicit modeling assumptions to
meet.
Additional Comments: Occupational cohort study of 5645 workers in two asbestos cement building materials plants in New Orleans, LA. Subjects were exposed primarily to
chrysotile dust however crocidolite was mentioned as another form of asbestos used in the plants and the study referenced workers exposed to amosite in
one factory. Exposures were only in particle units, with no ﬁber conversion factors.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Uninformative Exposure in this study was estimated solely by professional judgment. Job titles and
industry were coded according to the 1980 United States census codes. 505 individual
occupation codes were consolidated into 62 broader categories. A panel of four indus-
trial hygienists from the University of Washington developed the job exposure matrix for
participants. They had created JEMs previously. They classiﬁed the exposures examined
into four levels based on likelihood and degree of exposure. There were no quantitative
measures of exposure mentioned in this study.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium Four levels of exposure were generated for each individual participating in the study.
These were classiﬁed as no, low, medium, and high levels of exposure. These levels
were determined for participants based on the number of years employed in their jobs.
Additional Comments: While the authors were extremely thorough in their description of the steps taken for this study, there were some limitations in terms of being useful for
asbestos studies. There was a lack of power to detect an increase in risk. There were some positives for this study, such as adjusting for smoking and
drinking in their models, which has not been often in some other studies.Overall, information on the measurement of exposure metric (M4) to assess
exposure was limited. Therefore, the overall quality determination (OQD) is rated uninformative.

Domain 2: Exposure Characterization
Metric 4: Measurement of Exposure Low This metric is rated Low because authors in this paper do not explicitly cite use of PCM
or TEM for use with the samples used in this analysis. While they mention use of TEM,
they appear to reference chrysotile in general: "The amphibole contamination in com-
mercial chrysotile has been assessed by N. Kohyama (National Institute for Industrial
Health, Kawasaki, Japan, personal communication, 2000). He used the x-ray diffrac-
tion analysis and analytical transmission electron microscopy method, which can detect
amphibole contamination of 0.001 percent or more." The actual measurements used in
analysis are reported to be from "personal samplers that workers wore for 3 days in June
1999." The quantiﬁcation method is not speciﬁed. The authors also mention collecting
dust measurements, but no conversion factors are reported.
Metric 5: Exposure Levels Medium The authors reported summary statistics for multiple levels of exposure.
Additional Comments: QC was not completed for metrics other than Metrics 4 and 5 because the study does not have sufﬁcient exposure information to be useful for dose-response
