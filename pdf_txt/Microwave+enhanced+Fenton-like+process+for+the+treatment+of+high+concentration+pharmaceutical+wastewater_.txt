Introduction
Microwave-assisted Fenton-like processes using 
special supported catalysts are one of the emerging types of advanced oxidation processes (Abbr. AOPs) that can generate hydroxyl radicals (i.e.  OH) through the catalysis 
of hydrogen peroxide (H
2O2) by solid catalysts [1].
Moreover, MW-Fenton-like processes using special 
supported catalysts can result in high ef ﬁ ciency with 
simple catalyst separation. When performed under normal atmospheric pressure and temperature they are also known as microwave-assisted catalytic oxidation processes [2-4].              Original Research

Abstract
The ef ﬁ ciency of a microwave-assisted Fenton-like process using special supported catalysts was 
evaluated using total organic carbon (TOC) removal from pharmaceutical wastewater. No acidi ﬁ cation 
was required. The highest level of TOC removal ef ﬁ ciency from wastewater achieved was 65.88%. 
Moreover, the maximum number of consecutive uses with high activity was four. Under optimal conditions, the in ﬂ uent value of BOD
5/COD was 0.25, and the ef ﬂ uent value of BOD5/COD was elevated to 0.40. 
In addition, colour was completely removed. This ef ﬁ ciency was compared with the same MW-Fenton-
like process using common supported catalysts, where the highest achieved TOC removal ef ﬁ ciency from 
wastewater was 39.25%, the colour of the wastewater decreased from 50 to 20, and the value of BOD5/
COD was elevated from 0.25 to 0.34. The maximum number of consecutive high activity uses was two. This advanced performance was attributed to no presence of copper carbonate or cerium carbonate on the surface of special supported catalysts. The preparation method for these catalysts combined the merits of the isometric impregnation method with some new improvements. Its advantages include high-ef ﬁ ciency 
performance, short preparation time, low reagent usage (cupric nitrate 3.6 g, cerium nitrate 1.2 g, ammonia 1 mL), and reusability. The properties of the catalyst with the most ef ﬁ cient performance were characterized 
by determining surface particle size, the relative amount of active components and promoters, and the stable crystal form of the active components.

The supported catalysts are mainly composed of 
activity components, along with catalyst promoters and supports  [5]. Catalysts are prepared by impregnation [6-9] 
or, in the ﬁ eld of environmental catalysis, by precipitation 
methods [10-12].
In impregnation methods [13] the support is immersed 
in a solution containing activity components. The remaining liquid is removed when equilibrium is achieved, and the ﬁ nished catalyst is ﬁ nally obtained by calcination. 
Impregnation uses the shape of the support, and does not require catalyst moulding. In impregnation methods, the physical structures of the catalyst are determined by the catalyst support. 
In precipitation methods, a crystal structure (or gel) of 
oxide, hydrous oxide or carbonate is obtained by dosing the precipitant in the metal salt solution with active components. Then the deposits are separated, cleaned, and calcinated to obtain the ﬁ nished catalyst.
In this study, copper oxide and hydrous oxide (without 
copper carbonate), cerium oxide and hydrous oxide (without cerium carbonate), and granular activated carbon (GAC) from coal were used as  activity components, 
catalyst promoters, and catalyst supports, respectively. Given the merits and drawbacks of impregnation methods, a preparation method for special supported catalysts was developed. This preparation method retained the merits of isometric impregnation [14-16] with some improvements. 
In this study, the ﬁ nished catalyst was prepared with 
high ef ﬁ ciency, uniform particle size, short preparation 
time, low reagent use, and good reusability. A signi ﬁ cant 
improvement was observed in wastewater treatment. The ef ﬁ ciency of the MW-Fenton-like process using 
special supported catalysts was evaluated by total organic carbon (TOC) removal ef ﬁ ciency from pharmaceutical 
wastewater. The properties of the catalyst with the highest efﬁ ciency performance were characterised and evaluated. 
Materials and Methods
Wastewater and Materials
Chemical synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater 
was collected from a pharmaceutical factory in Tianjin, China. The main products of the factory were GCLE (7-Phenglacetamido-3-chloromethyl-3-chloromethyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid p-methoxybenzyl ester, a cephalosporin intermediate) and ribo ﬂ avin sodium 
phosphate, etc. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the pharmaceutical wastewater ﬁ ltered using a quantitative 
ﬁ lter. All reagents used in this study were analytically 
pure: cupric nitrate (Cu(NO
3)2·3H2O), cerium nitrate (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O)), hydrogen peroxide (30%), aqueous 
ammonia (22-25%), etc.
Experimental Methods
Catalyst Preparation and Characterisation Methods
The special supported catalyst was prepared as follows. 
A total of 10 g of GAC (the minimum amount) was placed in a 250 mL beaker, 6.0 copper nitrate and 2.4 g cerium nitrate were added to the beaker, and 3.6 mL of distilled water was added dropwise until the water could not be completely absorbed. When the isometric impregnation method was performed, the amount of distilled water was ﬁ xed at 4 mL/10 g GAC. 
For optimization of the catalyst preparation method, 
quanti ﬁ ed amounts of copper nitrate (1.2, 2.4, 3.6, 4.8, 
6.0 g) and cerium nitrate (0, 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4 g) were added into the beaker with 4 mL of distilled water (Table 2). The mixture was subsequently stirred to dissolve the reagents. Aqueous ammonia (1 mL) and quanti ﬁ ed GAC 
(5, 10, 20, 30, 40 g) were also added to the mixture. 
The entire mixture was transferred to a pressure pan, 
which was heated at 120ºC for 20 min. High temperature water vapour was used as an inert gas. The hydrothermal reaction was a mutual reaction between ammonia and nitrate ions, which caused copper oxide and hydrous oxide (without copper carbonate) to play a more effective role as activity components in the inner or outer layers of the catalyst.
At the end of the reaction, the pressure pan was opened 
and the mixture was transferred to a crucible. Then the entire mixture in the crucible was transferred to a muf ﬂ e 
furnace at a steady temperature (200, 300, 400, 500, 600ºC) for 1.5 h. Finally, the ﬁ nished catalyst was obtained. The 
properties of the special supported catalysts and GAC with the highest ef ﬁ ciency were characterized by scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) (Table 3), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). 
Experiments for ef ﬁ ciency optimization of the MW-
Fenton-like process using special supported catalysts were performed with no acidi ﬁ cation in this study. Ef ﬁ ciency 
of the process was optimized by varying the amount of hydrogen peroxide; MW radiation power; irradiation time; the amounts of copper nitrate, cerium nitrate, and GAC; calcination temperature, etc. Amounts and intensity of factors are given in Table 4. Changes in ef ﬁ ciency were 
evaluated by TOC removal ef ﬁ ciency from pharmaceutical 
wastewater. 
The wastewater treatment experiment was performed 
as follows. The ﬁ nished catalyst and hydrogen peroxide Table 1. Characteristics of pharmaceutical wastewater ﬁ ltered by quantitative ﬁ lter.

beginning of the reaction. Hydroxyl radicals (OHs) were generated through catalysis of hydrogen peroxide by the ﬁ nished catalysts.
Analytical Methods
In this study, chemical oxygen demand (COD) was 
measured using a COD rapid testing instrument (LianHua Technology Company, Lanzhou, China). Biochemical 
oxygen demand (BOD5) was determined using an IS6 
BOD system (WTW Corporation, Germany), and TOC was analyzed using a TOC analyzer (SHIMADZU, Japan). Cu
2+ ion concentration was measured using an 
atomic absorption spectrometer (HITACHI 180-80, Japan). Suspended solids (SS), NH
4+-N, and colour were 
determined according to standard methods [17]. pH was measured using a pH meter (pH-3C; LeiCi, Shanghai, China). A Midea household MW oven was used with different MW radiation power levels, namely high (700 W), medium-high (539 W), medium (385 W), and medium-low (281 W).
Results and Discussion
Effect of Hydrogen Peroxide Amount
To investigate the effect of hydrogen peroxide on the 
efﬁ ciency of the process, ﬁ ve 1L samples with the original 
concentration were prepared. Hydrogen peroxide was introduced at the proportion of 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10, and 25 mL/250 mL wastewater. The ﬁ nished catalyst was added 
to these samples, and the MW radiation power was set at medium-high (539 W), with a radiation time of 6 min. Inﬂ uent and ef ﬂ uent TOC were determined by the test 
methods shown in Figure 1a. When hydrogen peroxide was used at 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10, and 25 mL/250 mL, the TOC removal from pharmaceutical wastewater was 53.12%, 61.45%, 65.79%, 68.86%, and 70.94%, respectively. Thus, based on the ef ﬁ ciency of wastewater treatment 
and minimization of reagent usage, the optimal hydrogen peroxide ratio was 7.5 mL/250 mL.
Effect of MW Radiation Power
We used MW radiation power levels of high 
(700 W), medium-high (539 W), medium (385 W), medium-low (281 W), and none (0 W). Oxidation decomposition occurred in the Fenton-like process using the special

supported catalysts. The water samples containing 7.5 mL 
of H2O2 /250 mL wastewater and the ﬁ nished catalyst were 
irradiated at ﬁ ve MW levels to optimize the MW-Fenton-
like process. In ﬂ uent and ef ﬂ uent TOC was determined 
using the test methods shown in Fig. 1b. 
When the MW radiation power was high (700 W), 
medium-high (539 W), medium (385 W), medium-low (281 W), and none (0 W), values of TOC removal from pharmaceutical wastewater were 62.93%, 68.97%, 69.96%, 35.27%, and 23.43%, respectively. Thus, the optimal MW radiation power was medium-high (539 W). When the MW radiation power was increased to high (700 W), TOC removal ef ﬁ ciency from wastewater 
increased little, the reason being that high radiation power led to disabled decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. 
Effect of Radiation Time
The MW-Fenton-like process with special supported 
catalysts was explored at radiation times of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 min, respectively. In ﬂ uent and ef ﬂ uent TOC 
was determined after the reaction had ended by the test methods shown in Fig. 1c. When the radiation time was 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 min, the TOC removal ef ﬁ ciency from 
pharmaceutical wastewater was 37.84%, 58.91%, 65.45%, 65.68%, and 65.73%. Thus, the optimal radiation time was 6 min. When the radiation time was increased from 6 to 10 min, the TOC removal of wastewater did not increase, the reason being that hydrogen peroxide was completely decomposed at a radiation time of 6 min.
Effect of Copper Nitrate Amount
Copper was the activity component of the catalysts 
for the Fenton-like process [18]. The amounts of copper 
nitrate were 1.2, 2.4, 3.6, 4.8, and 6.0 g (Table 2). The volume of wastewater, the amount of hydrogen peroxide, MW radiation power, and radiation time were 250 mL, 7.5 mL, 539 W, and 6 min, respectively. In ﬂ uent and 
efﬂ uent TOC was determined using the test methods 
shown in Fig. 1d. In the catalyst preparation, copper oxide and hydrous oxide (without copper carbonate) was generated by the reaction of copper nitrate and a small amount of ammonia on the surface of the GAC, and was employed as a special supported catalyst. This method has not been previously reported [19-22]. 
Fig. 1d shows that TOC removal ef ﬁ ciency gradually 
increased from 59.15% to 66.11% when the copper nitrate amount increased from 1.2 g/10 g GAC to 3.6 g/10 g GAC. This relatively large increase resulted because more copper oxide and hydrous oxide was produced, and therefore more hydroxyl radical was generated. When the copper nitrate amount increased from 3.6 g/10 g GAC to 6.0 g/10 g GAC, the increase in TOC removal was small (from 66.11% to 66.68%). This result was attributed to an excess of copper oxide and hydrous oxide, resulting in the disabled decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Thus, the optimal dosage of copper nitrate in catalyst preparation was 3.6 g/10 g GAC. This low reagent usage was a characteristic of the process. 
Leaching of copper was measured by atomic 
absorption spectrometry, and the value was calculated to be 0.089 g/3.6 g (for copper nitrate). 
Effect of Cerium Nitrate Amount in 
the Catalyst Preparation
Ce played the role of catalyst promoter [23]. The 
cerium nitrate amounts were 0, 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, and 2.4 g. (Table 2). In the muf ﬂ e furnace, cerium nitrate reacted 
with ammonia to generate cerium oxide and hydrous oxide (without cerium carbonate) on the surface of GAC. Five types of ﬁ nished catalysts were obtained using different 
amounts of cerium nitrate. The volume of wastewater, the hydrogen peroxide amount, the MW power, and the MW radiation time were 250 mL, 7.5 mL, 539 W, and 6 min, respectively. In ﬂ uent and ef ﬂ uent TOC was determined by 
the test methods shown in Fig. 1e. 
As shown in Fig. 1e, TOC removal ef ﬁ ciency from 
wastewater increased from 60.89% to 69.75% when the cerium nitrate amount increased from 0 g/10 g GAC to 1.2 g/10 g GAC – a relatively large increase. Literature about AOPs has for a long time focused on catalyst promoters [24, 25]. Therefore, cerium oxide and hydrous oxide (without cerium carbonate) were used as promoters to cause copper oxide and hydrous oxide to play a role as activity components either at the inner or outer layers of the GAC, thereby improving the ef ﬁ ciency of the process 
by generating more hydroxyl radicals. 
When the cerium nitrate amount was increased from 
1.2 g/10 g GAC to 2.4 g/10 g GAC, there was a small decrease in TOC removal ef ﬁ ciency from 69.75% to 
67.95%. At higher amounts of cerium nitrate (>1.2 g/10 g GAC), cerium oxide (or hydrous oxide) and copper oxide (or hydrous oxide) competed with each other for loading on the catalyst support (GAC). Too much cerium nitrate led to lower loading of copper oxide (or hydrous oxide) on the catalyst support, reducing the ef ﬁ ciency of the process. 
Thus, the optimal ratio of cerium nitrate in catalyst preparation was 1.2 g/10 g GAC. 
Effect of GAC Amount in 
the Catalyst Preparation
GAC played the role of catalyst support, providing a 
reaction surface for generating hydroxyl radicals by the reaction of hydrogen peroxide and the ﬁ nished catalyst. 
The GAC amounts used were 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 g. (Table 2). Five types of ﬁ nished catalyst were obtained 
using different amounts of GAC. The volume of wastewater, the amount of hydrogen peroxide, MW power, and MW radiation time were 250 mL, 7.5 mL, 539 W, and 6 min, respectively. In ﬂ uent and ef ﬂ uent TOC was 
determined by the test methods shown in Fig. 1f.
Use of 5g of GAC resulted in relatively low TOC 
removal ef ﬁ ciency from wastewater (62.30%; Fig. 1f). 
This result was attributed to the small reaction surface between the catalyst and hydrogen peroxide. 1209 Efﬁ ciency Optimization of Pharmaceutical...
However, when the GAC amount was increased from 
5 g to 10 g, there was a large increase in TOC removal efﬁ ciency from wastewater (from 62.30% to 68.16%). 
Further increases in the amount of GAC used (such as 20, 30, or 40 g) would result in further increased TOC removal ef ﬁ ciency from wastewater because the reaction 
surface  area of the ﬁ nished catalysts would be increased 
accordingly. Compared amounts of all reagent usages with the surface of GAC, the optimal amount of GAC in the catalyst preparation was 10 g.

supported catalysts  (TOC0 = 155.9 mg/L, no acidi ﬁ cation).1210 Qi X., Li Z.
Effect of Calcination Temperatures 
in Catalyst Preparation
The calcination temperatures were 200ºC, 300ºC, 
400ºC, 500ºC, and 600ºC. The other preparation conditions are shown in Table 2. Five types of ﬁ nished catalysts were 
obtained using different calcination temperatures. In ﬂ uent 
and ef ﬂ uent TOC was determined by the test methods 
shown in Fig. 1g. The highest TOC removal ef ﬁ ciency 
of wastewater was obtained (65.88%) with the catalyst prepared at a calcination temperature of 400ºC (Fig. 1g). TOC removal ef ﬁ ciency of the wastewater with catalysts 
prepared at other calcination temperatures was lower. The temperature of calcination in ﬂ uenced the bonding force 
among copper oxide, cerium oxide (or hydrous oxide) and GAC. There are several reasons for these results. First, a very low temperature (200ºC) led to the low yield and poor adhesion ability of copper oxide and cerium oxide (or hydrous oxide) on the surface of the support. Second, very high temperatures (500ºC, 600ºC) led to strong oxidation of GAC and was antagonistic to the generation and loading of copper oxide and cerium oxide (or hydrous oxide). Thus, the optimal calcination temperature in catalyst preparation was 400°C. 
Change in BOD5/COD and Colour of the 
Wastewater under Optimal Conditions
The MW-Fenton-like process using special supported 
catalysts was explored under predetermined optimal conditions. The volume of wastewater, hydrogen peroxide amount, MW radiation power, and MW radiation time were 250 mL, 7.5 mL, 539 W, and 6 min, respectively. The COD and BOD
5 of inﬂ uent and ef ﬂ uent under optimal 
conditions were determined by the test methods outlined in Materials and Methods. 
The BOD
5/COD value of the in ﬂ uent was 0.25, and 
the BOD5/COD value of ef ﬂ uent was increased to 0.40. 
Thus, the biodegradation of the wastewater was obviously improved by the MW-Fenton-like process using special 
supported catalysts. 
Moreover, the initial colour of the pharmaceutical 
wastewater was 50; after the treatment, the colour of the efﬂ uent was 0.
Catalyst Ef ﬁ ciency after Regeneration 
and Possibility for Multiple Use
In the process of catalyst regeneration, catalysts were 
washed with distilled water after wastewater treatment [26-28], transferred to a drying box at a constant temperature of 110ºC, and the drying time was 1.5 h. The ef ﬁ ciency 
of the process was evaluated by TOC removal ef ﬁ ciency 
from wastewater, the experimental conditions were the same as above, and the possibility for multiple use of the catalyst with high-ef ﬁ ciency performance was checked. 
As shown in Fig. 2, the regenerated catalyst could be used with highly ef ﬁ cient performance four times. After being 
used four times, the catalyst starts to deactivate and should be discarded. 
Comparison with the MW-Fenton-like Process 
Using Common Supported Catalysts
Common supported catalyst means a catalyst prepared 
using the ordinary impregnation method. 3.6 g of copper nitrate and 1.2 g of cerium nitrate were added into the beaker with 4 mL of distilled water. The mixture was subsequently stirred to dissolve the reagents. 10 g of GAC was also added to the mixture, which was transferred to a crucible and moved to a muf ﬂ e furnace at a steady 
temperature of 400°C for 1.5 h. Finally, the ﬁ nished 
catalyst was obtained by ordinary impregnation method. 
The MW-Fenton-like process using common 
supported catalysts was explored using radiation times of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 min. The wastewater started to boil at 8 min. In ﬂ uent and ef ﬂ uent TOC was determined by the test 
methods shown in Fig. 3. 
At radiation times of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 min, TOC 
removal ef ﬁ ciencies from wastewater were 21.47%, 
Fig. 2. Effects of the number of uses of the special supported 
catalyst on TOC removal ef ﬁ ciency (TOC0 = 155.9 mg/L, no 
acidiﬁ cation).Fig. 3. Effects of radiation time on TOC removal ef ﬁ ciency in 
the experiment using common supported catalysts.1211 Efﬁ ciency Optimization of Pharmaceutical...
32.18%, 39.25%, 35.31%, and 35.72%, respectively. 
Thus, the optimal radiation time was 6 min (39.25%). Under these conditions, the coloration of the wastewater decreased from 50 to 20, and the BOD
5/COD value was elevated from 0.25 to 0.34. The ef ﬁ ciency of the MW-
Fenton-like process using common supported catalysts was lower than the process using special supported catalysts. The special supported catalysts performed better because copper carbonate or cerium carbonate were not present on the catalyst surface. 
The catalysts were washed with distilled water after 
wastewater treatment, and transferred to a drying box with a constant temperature of 110ºC. The drying time was 1.5 h. The experimental conditions were invariant. As shown in Figure 4, the maximum number of uses of the catalysts with high performance was two. After being used two times, the catalyst started to deactivate. 
Characterization of the Special Supported Catalysts 
with the Highest Performance Ef ﬁ ciency
The catalyst preparations combined the merits of the 
isometric impregnation method with some improvements, such as the hydrothermal reaction. The special supported catalysts also achieved better effects when used in wastewater treatment. The special supported catalysts Fig. 4. Effect of the number of uses of common supported catalysts on TOC removal ef ﬁ ciency.

with the highest performance ef ﬁ ciency were produced 
at a calcination temperature of 400ºC. The catalyst preparations were characterized by SEM, EDX, and XRD [29-30].
 SEM Analysis of Special Supported Catalysts
As shown in Figs 5 and 6, the surface structure of 
GAC (support) was stable and exhibited a uniform pore distribution. The particle size on the catalyst surface was also uniform. SEM analysis of the special supported catalysts indicated satisfactory catalyst distribution. 
EDX Tests on Special Supported Catalysts
Surface element tests were performed using EDX 
(Table 3 and Table 4). GAC from coal was used as the catalyst support. Table 3 shows the relative amounts of Ca, Si, Al, Mg, C, and O, and Table 4 shows that the relative amounts of the activity components and promoters were Cu at 66.13% and Ce at 28.06%. No copper carbonate or cerium carbonate was detected. 
XRD Tests on Special Supported Catalysts
As shown in Fig. 7, copper oxide was the only crystal 
component in the special supported catalysts, cerium oxide was undersized and amorphous, and other crystal components detected were part of the GAC.

Conclusions
The ef ﬁ ciency of an MW-Fenton-like process using 
special  supported catalysts was evaluated by TOC 
removal ef ﬁ ciency from wastewater. The highest TOC 
removal ef ﬁ ciency was 65.88% under optimal conditions 
without acidi ﬁ cation. Moreover, the BOD5/COD value 
was elevated from 0.25 to 0.40, colour was removed completely, and the maximum number of consecutive uses was four. By comparison, the MW-Fenton-like process using common supported catalysts (ef ﬁ ciency = 39.25%) 
achieved a BOD
5/COD increase from 0.25 to 0.34, and a 
decrease in colour of the wastewater from 50 to 20, and could be used for two times at most.
The properties of the catalysts with the highest 
efﬁ ciency performance were characterized. Particles 
sizes were uniform and the relative amounts of activity components and promoters were excellent (the copper and cerium percentages were 66.13% and 28.06%, respectively). Copper oxide was the only crystal form, and no copper carbonate or cerium carbonate was detected. 
In the catalyst preparation, copper oxide and hydrous 
oxide (without copper carbonate) was generated by copper nitrate and a small amount of ammonia, which was employed as the special supported catalyst. The high efﬁ ciency performance of the process was attributed to 
the lack of copper carbonate. Cerium oxide and hydrous oxide (without cerium carbonate) were used as promoters, causing the copper oxide and hydrous oxide to play the role of activity components either at the inner or outer layers of the GAC.
