Firas Saeed Abbas: Dyes Removal from Wastewater Using Agricultural Waste  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Capability of Rice Husk (RH) on the removal of four types of dyes pollutant from wastewater which were 
methylene blue, Congo red, brilliant green and crystal violent using different design parameters by adsorption 
process  is focus on . The desig n parameters studied to adsorb above four dyes using RH as an adsorbent material 
were initial concentration of dye, absorbance material packing height which was RH, pH of dye solution feed 
inlet, treatment time,  feed flow rate and feed temperature, these p arameters were varied from (1 -100) mg/l, (10 -
100) cm, (1 -8), (1 -60) min, (5 -100) ml/min and (20 –55°C) respectively. Results show that the higher removal 
efficiency was (95.81, 93.44, 96.62 and 96.35) % for  brilliant green, Congo red, crystal violent and me thylene 
blue dyes respectively  from aquatic solution and these efficiencies were decreased with increasing of initial 
concentration and flow rate while the removal efficiencies increased with increasing absorbance material bed 
height and feeding temperatur e. The removal efficiency was increased with increasing pH of solution for 
methylene blue, brilliant green and crystal violent dyes and decreased with increasing pH of solution for Congo red dye. Statistical model is achieved to find an expression combined  all operating parameters with the removal 
efficiency for dyes used in this paper in a general equation. By this way we can possess different benefits which 
are: remove the toxic dyes  contaminated the water, get rid of agricultural waste RH.

Introduction  
 
Extensive use of synthetic dyestuffs in a number 
of industrial processes such as textile, paper, plastics, 
food, cosmetics, and leather has brought about 
intractable environmental problems. Even a 
thimbleful of dye in water is highly visible and 
disgusting. The presence of various dyes also causes 
damage to living beings in water by reducing light 
penetration and inhibition of photosynthesis [ 1]. The 
textile dyeing units release lar ge quantities of dyes in 
their effluents [2]. Over 70,000 tons of 
approximately 10,000 types of dyes and pigments are 
produced annually worldwide, of which, about 20 –
30% are wasted in industrial effluents during the textile dyeing and finishing processes [3]. In 
addition, the stability of most dye molecules under 
the condition of light, heat and chemicals leads to the 
fact that the dyeing effluents are difficult to degrade 
[4,5] . These dyes not only affect the aesthetic value 
of the receiving water body but  also pose a major 
problem due to their resistance to chemical and biological degradation [6]. Many reactive azo dyes, constituting the largest dye groups decompose to 
potential carcinogenic aromatic amines under 
anaerobic conditions [7,8]. Economic, effective and feasible methods for comprehensive treatment of 
dyeing industrial effluents are therefore paid much 
more attention, owing to the increased environmental stress and consciousness from people. Processing 
methods on dye removal are classified as 
coag ulation, chemical oxidation, flocculation, hyper 
filtration, biological treatment and adsorption. 
Existing conventional technologies have suffered 
several drawbacks due to their high costs and low 
regeneration. Adsorption has been found to be 
superior to o ther techniques for treating wastewater: 
it is low -cost, highly efficient, simple, easy to 
perform and insensitive to toxic substances [9,10] . 
Adsorption onto activated carbon has been widely 
used in actual effluent treatment as a highly effective 
process despite its generous use in water and 
wastewater industries, activated carbon remains an 
expensive material. This has led to search for low -
cost adsorbent materials with potential to replace commercial activated carbons. However, the application of this ma terial is limited due to high cost 
and the difficulty in regeneration [11,12] . Therefore, 
studies on dye removal have been focusing on searching for abundant and low- cost adsorbents. 
Some agricultural wastes that have been converted to activated carbon for  use in dye adsorption are olive 1020

  kernels [13], Euphorbia rigida [14],  bamboo shoot 
[15] and jute fiber [16] for methylene blue removal, 
coconut flower for reactive red adsorption [17], 
bamboo dust, coconut shell, groundnut shell, rice 
husk and straw for re moval of Congo red and silk 
cotton hull for reactive blue removal [18] . For 
instance, agricultural by -products such as neem 
sawdust [19], palm kernel fiber [20], apple pomace 
[1] rice husk [21,22] , tree fern [23],  lemon peel [24] , 
Bokbunja seed [25] and pi neapple leaf [26]  have 
been widely studied for dye removal. The poplar leaf 
powders have been reported to have the potential as a 
novel adsorbent for heavy metals removal [27,28] . 
The aim of this investigation is to study the possibility of using rice husk  for removing dyes from 
aqueous solution, and benefit from the rice husk 
residue in eco -friendly method.  
  
Materials and Methods  
 Rice husk (adsorbent media) : 
 
Rice husk was collected from Al -Shanafia fields 
for rice in the Southern of Iraq. The rice husk was 
washed three times with doubled distilled water. Excess distilled water was used to remove the 
soluble materials present in the rice husk bringing 
from the field, boiled to remove colour and other fine 
impurities may be found in the rice husk, and then  
dried at 105 °C for 24 hours and the adsorbent thus 
processed was used in its original piece size. The 
surface area of RH was measured by BET (Brunauer 
– Emmett – Teller nitrogen adsorption technique). 
Characteristics of RH were presented in Table 1 . 
When the RH was heated in an oven, most of the 
water had been removed from the rice husk while the 
second major mass loss of about 45 -65% was 
attributed to the breakdown of cellulose constituent 
char, which is a carbonaceous residue.

Stock solutions : 
 
In order to avoid interference with other 
elements in wastewater, the experiments in this study 
were carried out using simulated synthetic aqueous 
solution (SSAS) of different dyes concentrations. 
1000 mg/l stock solution of dyes was prepared  by 
disso lving known weight of four types of dyes which 
were methylene blue, Congo red, brilliant green and 
crystal violent (each one alone) in one liter of double distilled water, all solutions using in the experiments 
were prepared by diluting the stock solution with 
double distilled water to the desired concentrations for the experimental work of this investigation. The 
dyes concentrations were measured using 
spectrophotometer thermo – genesys 10 UV, USA . 
 
Sorption unit : 
 
Fixed bed column of continuous mode 
exper iments were conducted in order to test four 
types of dyes removal by treated SSAS of above dyes 
each one alone at desired concentration with the 
various bed heights of the adsorbent media RH using different flow rates of SSAS of four types of dyes at vario us pH. The pH value was adjusted using 0.1 N 
NaOH and 0.1 N HCl solutions. A schematic 
representation of the sorption unit is shown in 
Figure1  where the flow direction is downward by 
gravity. The sorption unit consists of two glass 
container of SSAS of dye s one for inlet and another 
for outlet each of (1 liter) capacity. Glass column has 
2.54 cm ID and 150 cm height. The sorption column 
packed with adsorbent media to a height of (10, 20, 
30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 cm) supported from the top and the bottom by glass hollow cylinder 
layer, each cylinder have (0.5 cm ID, 0.1 cm 
thickness and 1 cm long). Before starting the runs, the packed bed sorption column was rinsed by 
double distilled water down flow through the 
column. The RH is packed in the colum n to the 
desired depth, and fed to it as slurry by mixing the 
media RH with distilled water in order to avoid the 
formation of air bubbles inside the media. After the 
packed bed sorption column was accommodation and 
putting the required amount of adsorbent  media, the 
adsorption process started by allowing the dyes 
SSAS of required concentration and pH down flow 
through the sorption column from inlet container by gravity at a precise flow rate in experiment which is

  adjusted by the valve as shown in Figure 1 . To 
determination the best operational conditions, the 
experiments were carried out at a temperature 
between (20 –55°C), various pH values which are 
(1–8) and initial feed concentrations of SSAS of 
different dyes which are between (1 –100) mg/l each 
one al one and at different flow rates which are between (5 –100) ml/min for dyes initial feed 
concentration. Outlet samples after treatment in each 
experiment were collected every 10 minutes from the 
bottom of packed column and the unadsorbed concentration of dyes in SSAS was analyzed by 
spectrophotometer.

Result and Discussion  
 The ability of RH to remove dyes from SSAS in 
fixed bed column of continuous mode  at various 
parameters which are pH’s of SSAS of dyes ( pH), 
height bed of adsorbent media RH ( h), flow rates of 
SSAS (F), SSAS  temperature ( T
feed) and time of 
treatment ( t) was investigated. The experiments were 
achieved by varying all above parameters for 
different initial concentrations ( Co) of SSAS of  dyes. 
Thus, the results obtained are explained below.  
 
Effect of Initial Concentration : 
 
The results showed that using adsorbent 
material , the percent removal of dyes was decreased 
when the initial concentration ( Co) of SSAS of dyes 
was increased at const ant other variables as shown in 
Figure 2 . This can be explained by the fact that the 
initial concentration of dyes had a restricted effect on 
dyes removal capacity; simultaneously the adsorbent 
media  had a limited number of active sites, which 
would have become saturated at a certain 
concentration. This was lead to the increase in the 
number of dyes molecules competing for the available functions groups on the surface of 
adsorbent material. Since the solution of lower 
concentration has a small amount of dye s than the 
solution of higher concentration of it, so the percent 
removal was decreased with increasing initial 
concentration of dyes. For adsorbent media, higher percent removal were (95.81, 93.44, 96.62 and 
96.35) % for brilliant green, Congo red, crysta l 
violent and methylene blue dyes respectively  at 
initial dyes concentration of 1 mg/l, so adsorbent material  was found to be efficient to dyes removal 
from SSAS and wastewater.  
 
Effect of pH : 
 The results showed that using adsorbent 
material , the percent removal of Congo red was 
decreased when the pH  of SSAS was increased at 
constant other variables, while the percent removal 
of methylene blue, brilliant green and crystal violent 
dyes were  increased when the pH  of SSAS was 
increased at constant other varia bles as shown in 
Figure 3 . It is well recognized that the pH of the 
aqueous solution is an important parameter in affecting adsorption of heavy metal ions [29] . High 
adsorption of Congo red at low pH can be explained  
in both terms; the species of Congo red  and the 
adsorbent surface.  For this case, at low pH,  i.e. acidic 
conditions, the surface of the adsorbent (RH) 
becomes highly protonated and favours adsorb of 
above group of Congo red dye in the anionic form. 
With increasing the pH of SSAS, the degree of 
protonation of the RH surface reduces gradually and 
hence adsorption is decreased [30].  
Furthermore, as pH increases there is 
competition between hydroxide ion 
 and 
species of Congo red, the former being the dominant 
species at higher pH valu es. The net positive surface 
potential of sorbent media decreases, resulting in a 
reduction the electrostatic attraction between the 
(sorbent ) Congo red species and the ( sorbate ) 
adsorbent material surface (RH), with a consequent 
reduced sorption capacity which ultimately leads to 
decrease in percentage adsorption of Congo red dye  
[11]. In the other hand, the adsorption of methylene 1022 
Adv. Environ. Biol., 7( 6): 1019-1026, 2013  
 
  blue, brilliant green and crystal violent dyes  (each 
one alone) can be explained by ion -exchange 
mechanism of sorption in whic h the important role is 
played by functional groups that have cation 
exchange properties. For this case at lower pH 
values, dyes removal was inhibited, possibly as a 
result of the competition between hydrogen and dyes 
molecules on the sorption sites, with an apparent 
preponderance of hydrogen ions, which restricts the 
approach of metal cations as in consequence of the 
repulsive force. As the pH increased, the ligand 
functional groups in adsorbent media (RH) would be 
exposed, increasing the negative charge density on 
the adsorbent material surface, increasing the 
attraction of dyes molecules with positive charge and allowing the sorption onto adsorbent material 
surface.  
 
Effect of Adsorbent Media Bed Height : 
 
The results elucidated that when the adsorbent 
media bed height was increased, the percent removal 
of dyes was increased too at constant other variables 
as shown in Figure 4 . The increased of bed height 
(h) meaning increased in the amount of adsorbent 
media RH, thus increasing the surface area of adsorbent material, hence increased the number of active sites in the adsorbent material surface i.e. 
increased the availability of binding sites for 
adsorption and consequently increase dyes removal capacity on RH . This lead to increase the ability of 
adsorbent m edia to adsorb greater amount of dyes 
from SSAS at different initial concentrations and 
ultimately the percent removal of dyes increased.  
 
Effect of Flow Rate : 
 
The results illustrated that when the flow rate of 
SSAS of dyes was increased, the percent remo val of 
dyes was decreased at constant other variables as 
shown in Figure 5 . This may be due to the fact that 
when the flow of SSAS of dyes increasing, the 
velocity of solution in the column packed with the 
adsorbent media RH was increasing too, so the solution spend shorter time than that spend in the 
column while at low flow rate, the SSAS of dyes resides in the column for a longer time, and therefore undergoes more treatment with the adsorbent media, thus the adsorbent media uptake low amount of dyes 
from  SSAS of dyes for high flow rate, therefore the 
percent removal of dyes was decreased when the 
flow rate was increased.  
 
Effect of Feed Temperature : 
 
The results demonstrated that when the 
temperature of feed which was SSAS of dyes was increased, the perce nt removal of dyes was increased 
too at constant other variables as shown in Figure 6 . 
The effect of temperature is fairly common and 
increasing the mobility of the acidic ion. 
Furthermore, increasing temperatures may produce a 
swelling effect within the i nternal structure of the 
adsorbent media enabling dyes ions to penetrate 
further. It was indicated that dyes  adsorption capacity 
increased with increasing feed temperature from 5 to 55°C . This effect may be due to the fact that at higher 
temperature an inc rease in active sites occurs due to 
bond rupture.  
 
Effect of Treatment Time : 
 The results demonstrated that when the 
treatment time of SSAS of dyes increased the percent removal of dyes increased at constant other variables 
as shown in Figure 7 . This may b e due to the fact 
that when the time of treatment of SSAS of dyes increasing and the velocity of SSAS in the column packed with the adsorbent material was remaining 
constant, the solution spend longer time than that 
spend it when the time of treatment decr eased, so the 
adsorbent material uptake more amount of dyes  from 
SSAS, therefore the percent removal of dyes  from 
SSAS was increased.  
 
Statistical Model : 
 
A statistical model was carried out on the 
experimental results obtained from this study. 
Regression Analysis and π Theorem was adopted to 
maintain a relation between the percent removal of dyes and the feed temperature, flow rate, pressure, pH of feed solution, initial concentration of dyes , 
adsorbent media RH bed height, treatment time and column diameter . These rel ations are shown in 
equations below.  
 Conclusion:  
 
Conclusions point demonstrate as below:  
1. RH showed a good ability to remove four 
types of dyes which are methylene blue, Congo red, 
brilliant green and crystal violent from SSAS using 
fixed bed adsorption unit. So, it could be 
recommended for removal of dyes from wastewater in Iraq instead of other material because it is valid, 
cheaper, economical, easy and simplicity for using, 
and has a high ability to adsorb dyes, can be used several times by costly rege neration method and can 
be used finally in another benefit uses.  
2. Maximum removal of dyes was (95.81, 
93.44, 96.62 and 96. 35) % for  brilliant green, Congo 
red, crystal violent and methylene blue dyes respectively  at initial dyes concentration of 1 mg/l .  
3. The percentage removal of dyes was 
increased with decreeing flow rate of SSAS, and initial concentration of dyes while the percentage 
removal was increasing with increasing of treatment 
time and the height of adsorbent material RH. The 
percentage removal was  increased with increasing 1023
