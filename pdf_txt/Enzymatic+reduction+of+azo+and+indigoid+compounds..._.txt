Abstract A customer- and environment-friendly method for
the decolorization azo dyes was developed. Azoreductasescould be used both to bleach hair dyed with azo dyes and to
reduce dyes in vat dyeing of textiles. A new reduced
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent azoreductaseofBacillus cereus , which showed high potential for
reduction of these dyes, was purified using a combination
of ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography andhad a molecular mass of 21.5 kDa. The optimum pH of the
azoreductase depended on the substrate and was within the
range of pH 6 to 7, while the maximum temperature wasreached at 40°C. Oxygen was shown to be an alternative
electron acceptor to azo compounds and must therefore be
excluded during enzymatic dye reduction. Biotransformationof the azo dyes Flame Orange and Ruby Red was studied in
more detail using UV-visible spectroscopy, high-performance
liquid chromatography, and mass spectrometry (MS). Re-duction of the azo bonds leads to cleavage of the dyes
resulting in the cleavage product 2-amino-1,3 dimethylimi-dazolium and N∼1∼,N∼1∼-dimethyl-1,4-benzenediamine for
Ruby Red, while only the first was detected for Flame
Orange because of MS instability of the expected 1,4-benzenediamine. The azoreductase was also found to reduce
vat dyes like Indigo Carmine (C.I. Acid Blue 74). Hydrogen
peroxide (H
2O2) as an oxidizing agent was used to reoxidize
the dye into the initial form. The reduction and oxidation
mechanism of Indigo Carmine was studied using UV-visible
spectroscopy.

Introduction
Azo dyes are used as components in permanent hair
dyes. Additionally, azo compounds represent the largestclass of dyes applied in the textile, food, and cosmetic
industry (Stolz 2001 ). Azo dyes used as components in
permanent hair dyes can only be decolorized by drasticmethods such as chemical bleaching using, for example,
hydrogen peroxide. However, this treatment can cause hair
damage and may cause health problems (Kleinszanto andSlaga 1982 ). Hence, the use of these methods requires
extreme precautions to prevent these adverse effects.
Therefore, it would be highly desirable to develop a
customer-friendly and safe treatment avoiding the use of
hazardous chemicals. Enzyme s that specifically oxidize or
reduce azo bonds and thereby decolorize dyed hair could
be an elegant alternative. Enzymes can be used under mild
conditions, and they do not have negative effects on hairand skin.Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2007) 77:321 –327

provided by Universidade do Minho: RepositoriUMBesides azo dyes, redox (vat) dyes occupy a significant
place in the dyeing of textile fabrics such as denim. Vat
dyes are insoluble in water but can be reduced, in thepresence of a reducing agent in an alkaline medium, to form
a water-soluble dye known as the leuko-compound. The
most commonly used reducing agent in vat dyeing issodium dithionite. However, one of the major drawbacks of
this industrial dyeing process is the high amount of sulfate,
sulfite, and thiosulfate in the wastewater and of the toxicsulfide formed subsequentl y by bio-corrosion of the
wastewater pipelines.
Again, our research efforts are focused on the replace-
ment of sodium dithionite by an enzymatic reduction of
redox dyes.
Azo and vat dyes are quite resistant to aerobic biological
degradation (Zollinger 1987 ); nevertheless, decolorization
in aerobic, anaerobic, anoxic, or combined treatment
processes have been reported (Banat et al. 1996 ; Bragger
et al. 1997 ; Rafii et al. 1990 ; Wuhrmann et al. 1980 ).
Microorganisms produce enzymes that reductively cleave
the azo bond at the expense of a reducing agent, typicallyNAD(P)H. The occurrence of these so-called azoreductases
has been reported for various bacteria.
Recently, we have shown that azoreductases can reduce
a large structural variety of systematically substituted azo
dyes, while oxidases (laccases, MnP) seem to have lesspotential for this purpose (Maier at al. 2004 ; Pricelius et al.
2007 ). The nonspecificity of the azoreductase reaction was
also demonstrated by many reports on the decolourizationof azo dyes by sewage sludge under anaerobic conditions
(Carliell et al. 1994 ; Moutaouakkil et al. 2003 ; Zollinger
1987 ). It seems that almost all azo compounds tested are
biologically reduced under anaerobic conditions, although
there are some indications that metal-ion-containing dyes
sometimes have reduced decolorization rates (Chung andStevens 1993 ). Cell extracts show usually much higher
rates for anaerobic reduction of azo dyes than preparations
of resting cells (Wuhrmann et al. 1980 ). This has generally
been explained by the low permeability of the cell
membranes for the azo compounds (Russ et al. 2000 ).In this paper, we report for the first time that a purified
azoreductase from Bacillus cereus was capable of reducing
Indigo Carmine. Additionally, hair dyes Flame Orange andRuby Red were chosen for this study because these dyes
are used in many cosmetic products on the market.
Materials and methods
Chemicals and enzymes
The azo dyes Flame Orange and Ruby Red were supplied
from CIBA Sc and are used as components in permanent
hair dyes (Fig. 1). Indigo Carmine (Fig. 1) was supplied
from Fluka and is used in food, cosmetics, and pharmacy.All other chemicals used were analytical grade and
purchased from Sigma. B. cereus was kindly provided from
F. Sousa (Sousa et al. 2007 ).
For the production of azoreductase, B. cereus was
cultivated for 12 h in 1-l baffled Erlenmeyer flasks on a
rotary shaker at 160 rpm and 38°C in 500 ml standard Inutrient medium (Merck) .Cells were harvested by centri-
fugation for 15 min at 3,000× g,a n dt h ep e l l e tw a s
resuspended in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0(2 ml buffer per gram of wet cell paste/45 g total yield).
Cell lysis was done with a French press (American
Instrument, Maryland, USA), performing three passes.
The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at
34,000× gfor 60 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was
filtered through a prefilter (Glass Fiber Filter with binder,
AP20, 75 mm, Millipore, Billerica, USA), a 45- μm filter
with pressure filtration, and through a Minisart single-use
syringe filter sterile EO using a 0.2- μmm e m b r a n e
(Sartorius, Hannover, Germany).
Assay for azoreductase activity
Assays were carried out in cuvettes with a total volume
of 1 ml. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the
amount of enzyme that transformed 1 μmol of substrate

50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 200 μlo ft h e
sample, and 200 μl of the azo dye Cibacrone Marine
( C . I .R e a c t i v eB l a c k5 ;1 0 0m gl−1). The reaction was
initiated by the addition of 200 μl reduced nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NADH; 7.09 mg ml−1,f i n a lc o n -
centration 2 mM) and followed spectrophotometrically at
595 nm. The slope of the initial linear decrease of
absorption was used to calculate the enzyme activitybased on the molar absorption coefficient of Cibacrone
Marine ( ɛ
595=35.5 mmol−1cm−1) as described previously
(Maier et al. 2004 ).
pH and temperature optima and stability
of the azoreductase
For determination of the pH dependence of azoreductase,
50 mM succinate buffer was adjusted to pH 3.0 to 5.0,50 mM sodium phosphate buffer was set to pH values of
6.0 and 7.0, and for pH 8.0 up to 11, a 50-mM borate buffer
was used. NADH solution and dyestuff solution wereprepared with the corresponding buffers. Samples were
incubated for 5 min, and adding NADH started the reaction.
For the determination of the temperature optimum, all
solutions were brought to the corresponding temperature
before mixing, and the spectrophotometer was temperaturecontrolled during measurement.
Protein purificationThe cell lysate of B. cereus was subjected to fractionated
ammonium sulfate precipitation at 40% saturation toremove impurities, followed by 60% saturation in a second
step to precipitate the azoreductase. The precipitated
proteins from the second precipitation step were collectedby centrifugation, and the pellet was dissolved in 30 ml of
phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.0). The solution was
desalted by dialysis against phosphate buffer (50 mM,pH 7.0) overnight. The desalted solution after ammonium
sulfate precipitation was filtrated trough a 0.45- μm filter, and
1.5 ml aliquots of the resulting solution were applied to aHiTrap Q FF column (Amersham Biosciences) installed in an
Amersham pharmacia biotech ÄKTA purifier 900; Pump P-
903; Monitor pH/Cond-900; Monitor UV-900; AutosamplerFrac-900 (Amersham Biosciences Europe GmbH, Vienna,
Austria). Proteins were eluted at 1 ml min
−1with the sample
buffer and with a stepwise-increasing concentration ofbuffer containing 1 M NaCl. Azoreductase-active fractions
were pooled and applied to the same column a second time.
The active fractions were collected and stored as the purifiedenzyme preparation. The protein content of samples
was measured by using the Bradford dye-binding assay
(Coomassie blue; Bio-Rad) according to the protocols of themanufacturers and using bovine serum albumin as the
standard.
Gel electrophoresis
Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was carried out as
described previously (Sousa et al. 2007 ), with some mod-
ifications for native PAGE, i.e., both the detergent compo-
nent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 2-mercaptoethanol(β-mercaptoethanol) were omitted. Twelve percent poly-
acrylamide gels were utilized, and broad-range molecular
weight markers from Pharmacia were used as standards. Foractivity staining, the method of Maier et al. ( 2004) was used.
The gel was immediately immersed in approximately 50 ml
of 50 μM Reactive Black 5 solution for 25 min. After
removal of the staining solution, the gel was put into a
desiccator and a vacuum was applied. Afterward, the
desiccator was filled with N
2, and a degassed NADH
solution (2 mM NADH in 50 mM phosphate buffer,
pH 7.0) was added under the N 2atmosphere. To make sure
that no oxygen remained in the test vessel, vacuumgeneration and N
2scavenging were repeated alternately
several times. Bands of the active enzyme appeared after
approximately 10 min as white spots within a blue
background.
Dye biotransformation studies
Biotransformation of Flame Orange, Ruby Red and Indigo
Carmine was carried out in cuvettes containing 1 U ml−1
azoreductase of crude cell extract from B. cereus and the
purified enzyme, 200 μgm l−1dye, 7 mM NADH in 50 mM
sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Decolorization was
monitored at lmaxof the dyes. Controls were run without
addition of enzymes.
High-performance liquid chromatography and mass
spectrometry analysis
Dye degradation products of Flame Orange and Ruby Red
were separated with an high-performance liquid chroma-tography (HPLC) system equipped with a RP18 column
(Amersham Biosciences Europe GmbH) with acetonitrile
and 15 mM H
3PO4,1 0m MH 2SO4, and distilled water as
the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1at 40°C.
Water was distilled twice and filtered through a 0.45- μm
Millipore filter and degassed before use.
A Dionex HPLC system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA)
consisting of a P580 pump, ASI-100 automated sample
injector, and a PDA-100 photodiode array detector wasused with the following operating conditions: injection
volume, 10 μl, and column temperature, 40°C; detection
wavelength was chosen according to the absorbanceAppl Microbiol Biotechnol (2007) 77:321 –327 323maxima for the azo dyes (Flame Orange=486 nm; Ruby
Red=526 nm in addition at 210, 220, and 300 nm). The
mobile phase was a degassed mixture of A, double distilledwater, and B, acetonitrile, under isocratic conditions
ranging from 8 to 25% depending on the dye.
For the detection of degradation products of Flame
Orange after reductase treatment, the mobile phase consisted
of B, 14%, 10 mM H
2SO4, 50%, and 36% of mobile phase
A. For the degradation products of Ruby Red, the mobilephases were B, 25%, 10 mM H
2SO4, 30%, and A, 45%.
The mass spectrometry (MS) analysis was done on an
Agilent MSD (Waldbronn, Germany) with direct injectionusing the following parameters: Drying gas temperature
350°C, drying gas pressure 40 psi, drying gas flow (nitrogen)
10 l min
−1, capillary voltage 3,500 V, fragmentor voltage
70 V, mass range 70 to 400 m/z. The data were analyzed
using the software Chemstation Rev. A 10.01 (Agilent). For
measurement in the positive mode, 0.01% acetic acid wasadded. To check for fragments formed during the MS, the
fragmentor voltage was set from 25 to 150 V.
Results
Purification of the azoreductase
For the purification of the B. cereus azoreductase, in the
first step, the cell lysate was subjected to fractionated
ammonium sulfate precipitation at 40 and 60% saturation.The sample resulting from precipitation had an activity of
8.45 U ml
−1and 120 mg of protein. The resulting solution
was desalted by repeated ultraf iltration and was fraction-
ated twice by anion-exchange chromatography with
a HiTrap Q FF. During this procedure, the specific
azoreductase activity based on protein increased from
0.03 U mg−1in the lysate to 0.67 U mg−1for the purified
enzyme with an amount of 0.03 mg of protein. The
azoreductase had a molecular mass of 21.5 kDa asdetermined by SDS-PAGE. Numerous attempts to use
the zymogram assay from de scribed previously (Maier
et al. 2004 ) with the purified azoreductase of B. cereus
failed. Unfortunately, only crude cell lysate and semi-
purified samples (desalted sample after ammonium sulfate
precipitation) showed activity in the native gel (Fig. 2).

The pH optimum of the azoreductase was determined
with cibracrone marine by measuring the activity within the
range of pH values 5.0 to 9.0, and an optimum was found atpH 7.0. The azoreductase activity increased almost linearly
in the temperature range from 20 to 30°C reaching its
optimum at 40°C.UV-Vis absorbance spectrometry and mass spectrometry
Our studies have demonstrated that Ruby Red and Flame
Orange were completely decolorized by azoreductase pre-pared from B. cereus (Fig. 3). Complete decolorization
of Flame Orange and Ruby Red by Bacillus -derived
azoreductases lead to several highly polar transformationproducts with a retention time of less than 1 min on HPLC.
The faster-eluting intermediates absorbed in the UV region.
The chromatographic peaks of several target compoundsoverlapped, but the gradient program could not be optimized
in such a way that it was possible to analyze intermediates
in detail. The peaks corresponding to Flame Orange andRuby Red disappeared completely indicating full conversion
of the azo dyes under the experimental conditions (incuba-
tion for 15 min with the azoreductase from B. cereus ).
Mass spectrometry
To exclude the possibility of dye degradation during MS
analysis, standards of Ruby Red and Flame Orange were
analyzed as well.

B. cereus should lead to the corresponding aromatic
amines (Maier et al. 2004 ). Indeed, the mass spectra of
the reduction products indicated reduction of Ruby Red to
the corresponding amines, N∼1∼,N∼1∼-dimethyl-1,4-
benzenediamine with a molecular mass of 136 and 2-amino-1,3 dimethylimidazolium with a mass of 112.
When Ruby Red was treated with azoreductases, a
decrease in the compounds with the m/zof 148 and 244
(the original dye) was observed with increasing incubation
time (samples taken at 5, 10, 20, 30 s). Concomitantly, an
increase in the m/zof 112, 122, and 136 was seen. No
other significant peak was found in the mass spectra of
any of the two dyes tested, i.e., that no by-product was
formed in significant concentrations during the reaction.
When Flame Orange was treated with azoreductases,
only an increase in the compound with the m/zof 112
ascribed to 2-amino-1,3 dimethylimidazolium was seen inthe course of the experiment, while the amount of the
degradation product m/z216 (the original dye) decreased
concomitantly. The expected compound with the m/z108
(1,4-benzenediamine) was not detected. However, as
demonstrated by using a standard of 1,4-benzenediamine,
this compound is not stabl e under the experimental
conditions (MS), and several coupling reactions could have
taken place.
Indigo Carmine
The reduction of Indigo Carmine with sodium dithionite
was followed spectrophotometrically. After 1 h, Indigo
Carmine was oxidized back with the addition of 50 μlo f
H
2O2(35%; see Fig. 4).
As shown in Fig. 5, Indigo Carmine could be reduced
with the azoreductase from B. cereus . This reaction was
depended on NADH. The addition of H 2O2, which is used
in vat dyeing (vat, Indigo, and sulfur dyes) lead to the
reoxidation of the dye after 1 h.Discussion
A new azoreductase was isolated from B. cereus that
decolorized a number of azo dyes. Two bands showingazoreductase activity were found after separation of the cell
lysate in gels combined with activity staining under an
oxygen-free atmosphere. Similarly, multiple azoreductaseshave been previously reported for the alkalothermophilic
Bacillus SF (Maier et al. 2004 ) and also for B. subtilis
where a knockout strain of the yhdA azoreductase still
showed activity.
In general, azoreductase activity could be increased in
the absence of oxygen. This biphasic reduction of dyes is inagreement with previous studies (Maier et al. 2004 ) and is
due to the fact that dioxygen can serve as an alternative
electron acceptor. Chung et al. mentioned a direct influenceof oxygen on the degradation rates of azo dyes by
Pseudomonas luteola , although they did not measure any
influence with the crude cell extract. However, it is almostnot possible to compare activity values from the literature
because most studies are based on the decolorization of
different dyes.
The azoreductase from B. cereus was purified by a
combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and anion-
exchange chromatography. Other authors have describedthe application of affinity chromatography for the purifica-
tion of azoreductase (Moutaouakkil et al. 2003 ). The
molecular mass of the azoreductase from B. cereus was
determined to be 21.5 kDa. Previously, molecular masses of
21 and 30 kDa were reported for azoreductases from
Pseudomonas sp. (Zimmermann et al. 1982 ), and a mass of
28 kDa was reported for the azoreductase from Enter-
obacter agglomerans (Moutaouakkil et al. 2003 ). Temper-
ature optima for azoreductases from B subtilis reported in
the literature range from 40 to 45°C (Hu 2001 ; Matsudomi
et al. 1977 ). Similarly, in this work, the azoreductase from
B. cereus showed a temperature optimum at 40°C with a
pH optimum at pH 7.

Fig. 5 Reduction of Indigo Carmine with the azoreductase of
B. cereusAppl Microbiol Biotechnol (2007) 77:321 –327 325We have demonstrated that biotransformation of the
azo hair dyes Flame Orange and Ruby Red can be
achieved by this reductase. Several previous studies haveshown that the initial step in the biodegradation of azo
dyes under anaerobic conditions is a reductive cleavage
of the azo bond at the expense of NADH or NADPHserving as electron donors for the reaction. This process
is catalyzed by soluble cytosolic enzymes with low
substrate specificity known a s azoreductases. Molecular
oxygen competes for the available reducing equivalents
with the azo dyes and slows down the reductive cleavage
of the azo bond. As previously shown for other azo dye-degrading microorganisms, decolorization of the azo
dyes Ruby Red and Flame Orange only occurred in the
presence of NADH or NADPH as a cosubstrate. WhenRuby Red was used as a target structure for reductive
cleavage, 2-amino-1,3 dimethylimidazolium and N∼1∼,
N∼1∼-dimethyl-1,4-benzenediamine could be detected by
MS upon treatment with the purified azoreductase. This
clearly demonstrates that azo bond cleavage occurs in the
presence of an azoreductase. In the case of Flame Orange,however, the products expected from reductive cleavage
could not be observed probably because of auto-oxidation
of the 1,4-benzenediamine as previously suggested.
When the azoreductase was incubated with Indigo
Carmine, a color change from blue to yellow indicatingthe reduction of the vat dye could be observed. This
reaction was slower than the reduction with chemical
reducing agents and required the presence of NADH.Nevertheless, the redox potential of the azoreductase
reaches a level of −500 mV with the addition of NADH
and could even be further decreased with other redoxmediators. Thus, there is a high potential to reduce various
vat dyes with this enzyme.
Concluding our results, we propose that the azoreductase
from B. cereus decolorizes azo dyes by cleaving the azo
bond leading to the free amines, while it is also able to
reduce Indigo Carmine to its leuko-form. Under anoxicconditions, this enzyme facilitates the transfer of electrons
via NADH to the azo dye, which is then reduced. The
reduction rate decreased when methyl groups as electron-donating substituents were introduced into the dye, like in
Ruby Red, but the reaction pathway was the same. Thus,
earlier results obtained by Zimmermann et al. (1982 ,1984 )
were confirmed that decolorization of azo dyes with
azoreductases can be enhanced with electron-withdrawing
groups at the aromatic ring, especially ortho-substitutions,which show this effect. Furthermore, it was reported that
substrates with an electron -negative substituent at the
phenyl ring would enhance the enzyme reaction rate. Thiseffect may be due to the fact that electron-withdrawing
groups lead to a decreased electron density at the N=Ndouble bond. Hence, electron transfer to this group is
released.
Summarizing our results, we have demonstrated the
potential of an azoreductase from B. cereus for the
reduction of azo and Indigoid compounds. Further studies
toward industrial application should focus on heterologousexpression of this enzyme in well-established hosts such
asB. subtilis as well as the use of well-established
commercial systems (e.g., formate dehydrogenase) forcofactor recycling.
