Abstract : Synthetic dyes persist in the environment due to their recalcitrant nature. Wide range of application of synthetic 
dyes in industrial and clinical set ups has led to an increased discharge of these dyes into the environment. The dyes being 
toxic and carcin ogenic have to undergo efficient treatment before releasing into the environment. Different physical and 
chemical methods have been adopted for the treatment of dye effluents. However biological methods are more favoured as 
they are cost efficient and envi ronment friendly. Most of the biological treatments of dyes rely on microorganisms like 
bacteria, fungi, algae and yeast. This review aims at providing a detailed account of bacterial degradation of widely used 
dyes belonging to the class of triphenylmetha ne dyes.

I. INTRODUCTION  
Synthetic dyes have a variety of applications in industrial as well as clinical set ups. They are synthetic aromatic water so luble 
dispersible organic colourants which interact with their substrates through physical, chemical, or mechanical attachments [1, 2]. 
Synthetic dyes contain an element or complex called the chromophore which is responsible for the absorption of light in a dye . 
Chromophores confer shading to the colour since they are equipped for absorbing light in the visible range while another com plex 
called auxochromes gives the colour deepening when introduced to coloured molecule  [3].  Based on the structure of the chromophore 
dyes can be categorised into different groups like azo dyes, anthraquinone dyes, nitro dyes, phthalein dyes, indigoid dy es and 
triphenylmethane dyes  [4]. Among the different classes of dyes azo dyes, anthraquinone and triphenylmethane dyes are the most 
commercially used dyes  [5]. 
A shift from natural dyes derived from plant and insect sources to synthetic dyes has been obse rved because of the wide range of 
available colours and cost efficiency of synthetic dyes  [3, 6]. The application of synthetic dyes is a common practice in industries 
like textile, food, cosmetic, leather, paint, paper, and pulp. The textile industries hav e been found to be one of the m ajor industries 
generating colou red effluent. Dyes do not completely bind to the substrate the loss of dye can vary from 2% for basic dye to 50% for 
reactive dyes  [7]. Since textile industries make use of different types of d yes the effluent released is highly coloured leading to 
contamination of the ground and surface water in the vicinity.  
Most of these synthetic dyes are recalcitrant in nature and resistant to degradation by factors like light, water, and oxidi zing agents  
[8, 9]. The recalcitrant nature of dyes leads to the accumulation of dyes and their by -products in the environment which can be toxic 
or carcinogenic to living organisms  [10].  
Dye containing effluents have proved to be hazardous to the receiving aquatic en vironment as it can disturb the symbiotic ecological 
balance because of reduced light penetration, disturbance in the photosynthetic activity and other aquatic biological process es [1, 11]. 
Most of the synthetic dyes are composed of carcinogenic compounds like benzidine and other aromatic compounds  [12]. Synthetic 
dyes are difficult to degrade in wastewater treatments because of their synthetic nature and complex aromatic structures. Due  to 
hazardous environmental implications of synthetic dyes, effluents c ontaining dyes should be treated for decolouriz ation or 
degradation.  
II. METHODS  OF DYE  DEGRADATION   
Different degradation methods such as chemical, physical, and biological methods have been followed. The physicochemical 
treatments include oxidation, ozonati on, electrocoagulation, adsorption, membrane filtration, flocculation, reverse osmosis, which 
are less effective owing to the complex molecular structure of synthetic dyes, waste produced and the cost [13, 14]. In compa rison to 
the physicochemical methods,  biological methods have been found to be advantageous due to the cost, decreased production of sludge 
and production of by products which are compatible with the environment [15, 16]. Biological processes degrade the complex 
compounds by mineralising orga nic contaminants without producing any toxic components [17].  
In recent years, the interest in biological degradation of synthetic dyes has escalated due to the toxicity and carcinogenici ty attributed 
with the degradation of synthetic dyes. Different micro organisms like fungi, bacteria, algae, and yeast have been found to decolourise 
and degrade the synthetic dyes under given environmental conditions. Reports have shown that microorganisms are able to 
decolourise dye -based effluents either by bio adsorption , bioaccumulation or degrade dye complexes with the help of extracellular or 
intracellular enzyme reduction  [18].The survival and adaptability of microorganisms decides the effectiveness of the treatment [19].

 III. DEGRADATION OF TRIPHE NYLMETHANE  DYES BY BACTERIA  
Triphenylmethane dyes are brightly coloured synthetic organic dyes having molecular structure based on hydrocarbon 
triphenylmethane. These dyes are clearly visible due to their bright and vibrant colouration, indicating water pollution. E fficient 
degradation of these dyes by several bacterial species has been reported ( Table 1 ). 
 
Microbial degradation of triphenylmethane dyes by bacteria is widely reported [20, 21]. The use of broad spectrum and highly 
efficient dye decolourising microorga nisms are essential for successful dye degradation. Factors such as dry weight of the 
microorganism, pH and the decolourization system affect the degradation of dyes [22]. Presently gram -negative microscopic 
organisms such as, Aeromonas, Escherichia, Citro bacter, Pseudomonas, and Sphingomonas  have been found to decolorize dyes or 
effluents [10]. Likewise, gram positive microscopic organisms, for example, Bacillus, Clostridium, Nocardia, Paenibacillus, 
Streptomyces, Micrococcus  have been found to degrade syn thetic dyes [23]. There are several studies showing the degradation of 
dyes by single pure microorganisms as well as consortium.  
 
Several studies focusing on biological degradation of dyes have shown that many species of   Pseudomonas have the ability to 
decolourise triphenylmethane dyes. A study by Yatome et al. showed that Pseudomonas pseudomallei  13NA were able to degrade 
basic violet 3  [24]. Sarnaik and Kanekar reported the degradation of methyl violet by Pseudomonas mendocina  MCM B -402. 
Pseudomonas me ndocina  also showed the ability to degrade malachite green adsorbed on chicken feathers [25]. Adsorption of 
malachite green on chicken feathers can hinder the degradation of chicken feathers by interfering with the metabolism of feat hers by 
soil microorgan isms [26].  Oranusi and Ogugbue explained the effect of co -substrates of the decolourisation of brilliant green and 
crystal violet by Pseudomonas sp . It was evident from this study that the percentage of decolourisation was greater in the presence 
of co -substrate than in the absence of co -substrate [27]. A novel species of Pseudomonas, Pseudomonas otitidis  WL-13 isolated from 
activated sludge from a wastewater treatment plant of a dyeing industry showed a high capacity to decolourise TPM dyes by 
adsorption of the dye onto the biomass [21]. Pseudomonas fluorescens  was also found to degrade direct orange 10228. An aerobic 
strain   Pseudomonas sp.  YB2 having relatively high salt tolerance and shows antibiotic resistance was identified by Tao et al for the 
degra dation of malachite green [29].

Various species of Bacillus  can degrade and decolorize different dyes. Yatome et al have reported that Bacillus subtilis  can degrade 
crystal violet, para rosaniline and Victoria blue  [30]. Zhang et al investigated the ability of spore laccase isolated from Bacillus 
vallismortis  to decolourise dyes like malachite green, aniline blue, and brilliant green  [31]. Deng et al investigated the ability of ISSN: 2455 -2631                                                                  © May  2021 IJSDR | Volume 6 Issue 5

 Bacillus cereus  DC11 to degrade synthetic dyes. The results showed that Bacillus cereus  DC11 was able to decolourise TPM dyes, 
azo dyes and anthraquinone dyes  [32]. 
 
Degradation of crystal violet, malachite green, phenol red, methyl ene red and fuchsin by different species of bacteria have been 
reported. Staphylococcus epidermidis  degrades crystal violet, malachite green, phenol red, methylene red and fuchsin into non -toxic 
products33. The UV viz adsorption peaks decrease indicating t he decolourisation of the dye. Hence, the appearance or disappearance 
of visible light absorbance peak indicates degradation.  
 
Decolorization of crystal violet, malachite green, pararosaniline, ethyl violet, brilliant green and magenta by Kurthia sp . was reported 
by Sani and his coworkers  [34]. This species exhibited only intracellular decolourising activity by removing 98% colour under aerobic 
conditions. The dyes such as brilliant green and pararosaniline showed 100% rate of decolourization while other d yes magenta, crystal 
violet and malachite green showed 92%, 96% and 96% respectively. However, ethyl violet was the least decolourised dye and 
severely affected cell viability. The degradation of malachite green dye by Sphingomonas paucimobilis  under shaki ng conditions 
within 4 hours of incubation was reported by Ayed and his coworkers [ 35]. Malachite green has been found to be decolourised by 
Kocurea rosea  MTCC 1532 under shaking anaerobic conditions  [36]. Malachite green is also found to be degraded by Enterobacter 
sp. CV -S1 and Enterobacter sp. CM -S1 at concentrations up to 15mg/L at pH 6.5  [37].  
 
Actinobacteria  like Streptomyces  have the potential for decolourising synthetic dyes majorly belonging to the azo group of dyes  [38, 
39, 40]. However few studies have investigated the role of Streptomyces in the decolourisation of TPM dyes. A strain of 
Streptomyces, Streptomyces microflavus CKS6 was found to degrade crystal violet in a two -step process of bio adsorption followed 
by enzymatic a ction with lignin peroxidase having a prominent role in degradation  [41]. Streptomyces chrestomyceticus  S20 showed 
capability of degrading malachite green. Addition of carbon and nitrogen sources like 1% glucose and yeast extract greatly en hanced 
degradati on [42].  In another study it was observed that parameters such as pH, dye concentration, agitation speed, biomass and 
oxygen greatly influenced the decolourising ability of Streptomyces sp.  In a comparison between the decolourisation ability of live 
and d ead cell it was found that live showed higher efficiency at an optimum pH of 7 [43].  
 
IV CONCLUSION  
 
The toxicity associated with synthetic dyes and their by -products calls for urgent attention toward the treatment of these compounds. 
Biological methods ha ve been found to be effective in comparison to the physical and chemical methods because of the non -toxic 
end product, cost effectiveness and increased efficiency of biological methods. The use of bacteria as single species or in c onsortium 
with other spec ies has been found to be effective in the treatment of many triphenylmethane dyes. Many studies have found bacterial 
consortium to be more effective when compared to a single species. Similarly studies have also shown that facultative anaerob es 
have an inc reased decolourisation potential. Degradation of dyes using bacteria is being largely followed and considered important 
in effluent treatments. Certain strains of bacteria have the ability to completely decolourize and break the dyes into simple r non -toxic  
products. They are comparatively easier to culture given the appropriate conditions when compared to fungi and grow in a fast er rate. 
Genetic manipulations can be done in bacterial strains to improve their efficiency. Decolourisation ability of live and d ead bacterial 
cells have also been investigated which shows that live cells are efficient in degrading and decolourising dyes when compared  with 
dead cells.  Bacteria are able to degrade dyes due to their enzymatic machinery, where the enzymes can be intra cellular or 
extracellular. Mainly the enzymes involved in the degradation process belong to the oxidoreductase class of enzymes. These 
characteristics make them the most preferred organisms in the degradation. The commonly used bacterial genus to decolouri ze TPM 
dyes are Pseudomonas, Citrobacter, Desulfovibrio, Mycobacterium . Degradation or decolourisation efficiency is also affected by 
other operational parameters like pH, temperature, dye concentration, biomass, carbon and nitrogen availability. Hence opt imization 
of these parameters is required for obtaining maximum degradation of synthetic dyes.
