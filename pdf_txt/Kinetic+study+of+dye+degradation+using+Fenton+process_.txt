ABSTRACT
The textile industry is one of the fastest-growing industries that significantly contribute to 
the economic growth in Malaysia. Dyeing wastewater is one of the more difficult to control 
in industrial wastewater. Methylene blue is a widely used dye in the textile industry, which 
cannot be discharged directly into the natural environment without treatment. The present 
study involves the degradation of methylene blue by a Fenton-like system using calcium 
peroxide (CaO 2, CP). The process of degradation was recorded spectrophotometrically. 
The field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and energy dispersive X-ray 
(EDX) were measured for testing the purchased commercial calcium peroxide. The effect 
of pH, the initial dosage of CaO 2, and temperatures were studied with kinetics modeling, 
respectively. The results indicated that 97.07% removal of methylene blue took place at the 
optimum condition (pH=3.0, initial CaO 2 dosage=3.0 g, 65°C, 150 rpm, contact time=60 
minutes). Over four models (zero-order, first-order, second-order, Behnajady, Modirshahla, 
and Ghanbary (BMG) model) applied in this study, the BMG model with the R2=0.9935 
was in accordance with the experimental data.

INTRODUCTION
The textile industry has always been the 
fastest growing and most widely used 
industry in Malaysia; what follows is 
that this industry also has high water 
consumption and subsequently produces a 1088
Pertanika J. Sci. & Technol. 30 (2): 1087 - 1102 (2022)Fan Li, Thomas Shean Yaw Choong, Soroush Soltani, Luqman Chuah Abdullah and Siti Nurul Ain Md. Jamilhigh discharge rate of wastewater with a high load of contaminants (Pang & Abdullah, 
2013). Dyeing wastewater is present in a large amount of effluent. Each ton of textile 
processing consumes 100 to 200 tons of water, of which 80 to 90% becomes wastewater. 
The release of dyes into the environment during textile fiber dyeing and finishing processes 
is the main source of water pollution. The problems with dyeing wastewater are the 
content of organic matter that is non-biodegradable, toxic, and high chroma. Therefore 
many difficulties are added to the design of wastewater treatment process and operation 
management, which is a type of industrial wastewater with great environmental hazards 
(Yaseen & Scholz, 2019). Individual wastewater treatment through physical, biological, 
or chemical methods is often very costly and results in large sludge. Therefore, finding 
an effective method to complete fast and high rate decolorization for dye wastewater has 
been focused on in recent years. 
Dye effluents released from numerous dye-utilizing industries are harmful to the 
environment and living things. Dyeing wastewater should be treated first before release 
to minimize its negative impacts on the environment and living things (Katheresan et al., 
2018a). Dyes are colorful substances designed to give fabrics, papers, or any colorable 
materials a hue. It is possible as dyes can attach themselves to any amenable materials 
(Yagub et al., 2014). It has been reported that the main methods for dye removal can be 
separated into three categories: biological, chemical, and physical treatments. Among 
these, chemical oxidation is the main method for decolorization of dye wastewater, with 
the commonly used oxidants being ozone or chlorine and its oxygen-containing compounds 
(Ameta et al., 2014). In contrast, ozone is expensive and inconvenient to put into practice. 
Additionally, chlorine and its oxygen-containing compounds as oxidants can eventually 
generate chlorine-containing organic compounds resulting in secondary pollution (Cuerda-
Correa et al., 2020). Also, the use of one individual process may often not be sufficient 
to achieve complete decolorization (Sun et al., 2019). It leads to the study of other more 
effective methods, such as the Fenton-like system employed in this work, one of the 
advanced oxidation processes applied for dye removal (Girard, 2013).
Methylene blue is 3,7-bis(dimethylamino)-phenothiazine-5-ium chloride with the 
molecular formula C 16H18N3SCl (molecular structure as shown in Figure 1, molecular 
weight = 371.91). This dye belongs to the class of thiazine dye at room temperature, 
which appears as a solid, odorless, dark 
green powder. The color of the dye solution 
in water is blue. It absorbs at 663-667 nm. 
Moreover, methylene blue is widely used 
in chemical indicators, dyes, biological 
stains, and pharmaceuticals, especially in 
the dyeing industry for the manufacture of 
Figure 1 . Structure of methylene blue1089
Pertanika J. Sci. & Technol. 30 (2): 1087 - 1102 (2022)A Kinetics Study of the Degradation of Methylene Blueinks. However, due to its toxicity and removal difficulty, methylene blue has caused serious 
harm to the ecological environment and also caused irreversible damage to the human body.
Calcium peroxide (CaO 2, CP) is an odorless, tasteless, safe, and non-toxic oxygen 
release agent regarded as the solid form of H 2O2. The dried product is quite stable at 
room temperature and easy to store and transfer compared with liquid H 2O2. It is used for 
water-soluble dye wastewater treatment due to its significantly effective decolorization rate 
(Olyaie et al., 2012). Calcium peroxide in the presence of Fe2+ in an acidic medium can 
release highly active, strong oxidizing hydroxyl free radicals (·OH), resulting in a higher 
decolorization rate. The reaction mechanism is as follows:
CaO 2 +2H+   Ca2+ +H 2O2
H2O2 +Fe2+  Fe3+ + OH- + ·OH,
Fe2+ + ·OH  Fe3+ + OH- ,
Fe3+ + H 2O2  Fe2+ + H+ + HO 2·,
HO 2· + H 2O2  O2 + H 2O + ·OH 
·OH + organics(MB)→ products(3, 7 bis-dimethylaminophenothiazine ion) + CO 2+ H 2O
Under the acid condition, CaO 2 is converted to H 2O2. Then, H 2O2 reacts rapidly with 
Fe2+ to generate OH radicals and Fe3+ with strong oxidizing ability. Moreover, Fe3+ reacts 
with H 2O2 to slowly form Fe2+, OH radicals attack organic molecules, oxidizes, and destroy 
the chromophoric groups to achieve the purpose of degradation (Liu, 2018). That is to say, 
as mentioned previously, the methylene blue solution is blue naturally. When encountering 
strong oxidants, it will lose electrons to form colorless 3, 7 bis-dimethylaminophenothiazine 
ions. In addition, the degradation process of MB triggers the decrease of toxicity due to 
the destruction of chemical structure. Based on the reactions above, it can be concluded 
that the oxidized by-products are CO 2 and H 2O, which are nontoxic.
In recent years, ample evidence exists to support the view that the Fenton system, as 
a typical advanced oxidation process (AOPs), is extremely efficient in treating wastewater 
containing MB and any other dye molecules, such as chromotrope 2R, methyl orange, 
phenol red (Katheresan et al., 2018b). Therefore, according to several kinetic models, it is 
vital to assess the rate of dye decolorization. More importantly, kinetic models developed 
on a laboratory scale are essential for reactor design, scale-up, and performance prediction. 
Only a first-order linear model has been employed in a few recent kinetics investigations 
of wastewater via Fenton processes. However, certain correlation coefficients defining 
reaction kinetics (R2) were lower than 0.9 (Hou et al., 2016), indicating that the first-order 
model is not always the most appropriate. To summarize, the current work aims to conduct 1090

Modirshahla, and Ghanbary). Here, it is worth mentioning that the BMG model is a 
kinetic model established to predict the decolorization by the Fenton process under various 
operating circumstances. This model can be applied to study a system that includes the 
effects of hydrogen peroxide, Fe(II), and dye concentrations or temperatures (Behnajady 
et al., 2007).
Previous researchers have reported on the removal of methylene blue from wastewater, 
but the cost of those methods is still quite high; meanwhile, the process will also generate 
other by-products or by-waste. In this work, commercial calcium peroxide, as a solid form 
of hydrogen peroxide under the catalysis of Ferrous ion (FeSO 4), was used for methylene 
blue removal from wastewater. Furthermore, the effect of pH, the effect of initial calcium 
peroxide dosage, and temperature were also reported with four kinetics models applied.  
MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY
Chemical Reagents and Instruments
Methylene blue, calcium peroxide (65%, commercial), ferrous sulfate (FeSO 4), sodium 
sulfite (Na 2SO 3, 2.0 M), sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2, 
30%, 9.8 M), and other chemicals employed in the present study were of analytical 
grade chemicals. The pH of the solution was measured by the digital pH meter (Model: 
Sartorius PB-10). The desired pH of the solution was adjusted by the addition of previously 
standardized 0.1 N hydrochloric acid and 0.1 N sodium hydroxide solutions. UV 
spectrophotometer (Model: HALO DB-20) was used to monitor the degradation process. 
Methodology 
Calcium peroxide (65%, commercial) was purchased, with field emission scanning electron 
microscope (FESEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) applied to identify the 
particle appearance, size range together with the elemental composition of materials. 10 
ppm solution of methylene blue was prepared in a volumetric flask with distilled water 
and stored as a stock solution. This solution was further used as a standard dye solution in 
the desired wastewater environment. Ferrous sulfate (FeSO 4), as the source of Fe2+, was 
prepared at the concentration of 0.5 mmol L-1. The pH value was adjusted at pH=3.0 as the 
optimal reaction pH for the Fenton-like system using standardized 0.1 N hydrochloric acid 
and 0.1 N sodium hydroxide solutions. The analysis of the concentration of the MB was 
carried out by using UV-Vis spectroscopy, in which the MB molecule exhibits an absorbance 
spectrum at 665 nm. In order to quench the Fenton-like reaction, 0.5 mL sodium sulfite 
(Na 2SO 3) was added into  each sample before absorbance determination to consume residual 1091

as well. Ultimately, dye removal percentage was calculated by the following Equation 1: 
 [1]
where C 0 and C t are the concentration of dye (methylene blue) at initial and a given contact 
time t, respectively.
The following parameters were studied in the present study:
Effect of pH
The effect of pH on methylene blue removal was evaluated at the pH value of 3, 7, and 
11. In this set, experiments were conducted with other parameters retained (3.0 g CaO 2, 
100 mL 10 ppm MB solution, 150 rpm, RT=25 ± 2℃, contact time= 60 minutes) while 
the absorbance values were acquired for every 10 minutes.
Effect of Initial Dosage of CaO 2
The effect of CaO 2 dosage on the rate of degradation was investigated by varying the 
initial dosage of CaO 2 from 0.5, 1.5, and 3.0 g. Next, 100 mL 10 ppm of methylene blue 
solution was added into a conical flask. The initial pH of MB solution was tested at pH=5.65 
naturally and adjusted to pH=3.0. Then, the solution was placed into a water bath shaker and 
agitated at 150 rpm. The experiment was conducted at room temperature, around 25°C. The 
sample was withdrawn from the flask every 10 minutes in duration of 1 h and was filtered 
through 0.25 μm filter paper. Then, 2 mL of the filtered sample was filled into a cuvette to 
determine the absorbance and concentration by using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer.
Effect of Temperature
The effect of temperature on methylene blue removal was evaluated at 25 ± 2℃ (room 
temperature), 45, 65℃. In this set, experiments were conducted with retaining other 
parameters (3.0 g CaO 2, 100 mL 10 ppm MB solution, pH=3.0, 150 rpm, contact time= 
60 minutes) while the absorbance values were acquired every 10 minutes.
Kinetics Study
Four kinetic models (zero-order, first-order, second-order models, and BMG models) were 
applied in this work for kinetics studies (Santana et al., 2019). The modeling equations are 
listed in Table 1, respectively:1092

The morphology of samples was evaluated by FESEM images (Rashid et al., 2018). Figures 
2 (a) and (b) indicate that commercial calcium peroxide [a): 100,000x, b): 200,000x] appears 
irregular flake shapes of particles, along with excessive aggregation, which lowers surface 
area and reaction efficiency. The particle size ranges from 130 nm to 355 nm, which is 
greatly larger than nanoparticles measured in typical research conducted (Madan et al., 
2016).Table 1

Effect of pH 
As is mentioned earlier, pH is another essential parameter for the Fenton system. In the 
Fenton process, the H+ concentration greatly affects the formation of H 2O2, which in turn 
controls the generation of the hydroxyl radical. Therefore, pH is one of the most important 
factors to study. Since the form of iron in the solution is restricted by the pH, the Fenton 
reagent only works under acidic conditions. In neutral and alkaline environments, Fe 
cannot catalyze the production of H 2O2 completely, resulting in lower removal. In this 
study, as shown in Figure 4, the optimal pH was obtained at pH=3.0, with a total removal 
percentage of 87.57%. Beside that, removal percentage achieved 67.70% and 43.90% over 
pH=7.0 and pH=11.0, respectively. Prior researchers have reported that when pH value is 
in the range of 2 to 4, the removal effect is higher, and the optimal occurs at pH=2.5 - 3.5. 
A representative work conducted previously suggested that the optimum pH for dyeing 
wastewater treatment was 3, with over 20 dyes studied (Xu et al., 2004). Tran and coworkers 
reported that at pH=3.0 using the Fenton process, the maximal removal percentage (91.91%) sample. The atomic % of Ca and O are 
23.12% and 58.43%, respectively. Peaks 
assigned to the Pt are presented as well 
because Pt properly coated the sample. 
The overall weight% and atomic% are also 
reported in Table 2. Furthermore, the EDX 
result confirmed the presence of C elements 
in the nanoparticles due to the impurities 
during the synthesis process.1094

solid peroxides, such as CaO 2, Na 2O2, and liquid H 2O2, the optimal pH is 2.5 (Trovó et al., 
2016). To conclude, pH=3.0 is regarded as the optimum pH for the removal of methylene 
blue using a Fenton-like reagent. When it comes to the kinetics modeling shown in Figure 
5 and Table 3, it can be concluded that the second-order fit the reaction the most with R2 
value= 0.9498 compared to the other models. Aiming at the BMG model, pH=3.0 showed 
the best suitability with R2 value= 0.9925. Setup (pH= 11.0) could not fit the BMG model 
due to low decay based on the experimental data.

Pertanika J. Sci. & Technol. 30 (2): 1087 - 1102 (2022)A Kinetics Study of the Degradation of Methylene BlueEffect of Initial Dosage of Calcium Peroxide 
To the main point, the kinetic study on different initial dosages in the range of 0.5 to 3.0 
g was shown in Figure 6 (a), and on the right side, the overall removal percentages with 
different initial CaO 2 dosages were also presented in Figure 6 (b). It can be seen that with the 
increase of initial dosage (0.5 g-3.0 g), a higher removal percentage was obtained (80.39%, 
83.66%, 88.08%). As observed from the plot, there is a sharp plunge of concentration in the 
first hour of contacting time, which reveals the Fenton-like system is a rapid and effective 
reaction at the initial stage.
Linear regression analyses based on zero-, first-, and second-order reaction kinetics 
for the removal of methylene blue (MB) through Fenton-like processes were conducted 
to obtain the values of k 0, k1, and k 2, as well as the BMG model, for which the results are 
shown in Table 4 and Figure 7. According to the correlation coefficient values(R2), the 
second-order reaction kinetics was the most fitted to present degradation process for the 
reason that the highest R2=0.9871 was obtained, followed by the BMG model (R2=0.9761), 
subsequently first-order reaction model (R2=0.9115) and zero-order model (R2=0.7407) as 
the lowest correlation coefficient values (R2). Considering parameter 1/b obtained by the Table 3

1/b) is quite close at each dosage. In terms of parameter 1/m (Initial Degradation Rate), 
which keeps an upward tendency, it indicates that with 3.0 g calcium peroxide dosage 
holds the most initial degradation rate. In addition, a sharp surge of initial degradation 
rate happened from the dosage of 0.5 to 3.0 g initial calcium peroxide dosage. It can be 
estimated that initial CP dosage impacts both initial degradation rate and total removal 
percentage. Besides, the oxidation of organic compounds by Fenton processes using Fe2+ 
as a catalyst generally proceeds via two stages: a fast one and a much slower one. The last 
stage is attributed to a reaction between Fe2+ and H 2O2, while the slower one is due to the

was inferred from the first order, second order, and BMG model, it is also can be found 
that the suitability of more than one kinetic model is also common for modeling study.
Effect of Temperature 
Among the parameters relating to the Fenton process, temperature and initial reaction pH 
affect removal reaction in significant measure (Sun et al., 2019). Generally, temperature 
plays an important part in many chemical reactions, which means the reaction rate 
will increase with temperature (Soltani et al., 2017; Rashid et al., 2018). Some studies 
demonstrated that as the reaction temperature increases, the degradation rate of contaminant 
also increases steadily in the Fenton system (Emami et al., 2010). Nevertheless, in some 
research, it has been reported that for the Fenton system, once the temperature reaches 
a certain degree, the reaction will slow down or stop, in turn declining the total removal 
percentage of contaminants. Most probably, the generation rate of •OH is enhanced at a 
high temperature, but when the temperature approaches a certain point, hydrogen peroxide 
undergoes self-accelerating decomposition, thus reducing the concentration of •OH (Soltani 
et al., 2020). Likewise, it was reported that while reaching more than 30℃, the removal 
rate down slowly. At low temperature, activation energy is insufficient, inhibiting the 
synthesis of HO•, while at high temperature, the decomposition of H 2O2 into HO• becomes 
faster, the concentration of HO• increases (Zhou et al., 2012). Both sides claimed that 
temperature increment had a positive and promoting impact on the degradation process. 
In this work, seen from Figure 8, as the temperature goes up, the degradation is greater 
and faster as revealed at 65°C with the highest total removal percentage= 97.07% within 
60 minutes. While 92.76% removal of MB at T=45°C and 87.57% removal of MB at RT 
were achieved. It is also worth noting that the decolorization reaction takes less time at

the practically total removal % value of the process at RT (25°C) in roughly 30 minutes. 
Four kinetic models were applied to test the reaction at different temperatures. 
The kinetic parameter plots and data are shown in Figure 9 and Table 5. Regarding the 
three classical kinetic models, the increase in the apparent rate constant as a function of 
temperature can be verified. As for the BMG model, due to the increase in temperature, an 
increase in oxidation capacity (1/b) and a faster initial reaction rate (1/m) can be observed. 
In this set of experiments, the BMG model fits the experimental data well, and R2=0.9935

Comparison of Dye Removal in Wastewater by Fenton (Fenton-like) Processes
Table 6 summarizes the previous works in terms of dyeing wastewater treatment through 
Fenton and Fenton-like processes. It demonstrated that Fenton and Fenton-like processes 
perform outstandingly for soluble and insoluble dyes suggesting its superior cost-
effectiveness in removing various dyes. The present work provides a new approach for 
Fenton processes in wastewater treatment, which can be employed further in the industrial 
field considering the cost and efficiency.

CONCLUSION
In the present work, the degradation of methylene blue in a Fenton-like system was 
investigated using commercial calcium peroxide as an oxidant. Various parameters such as 
the effect of pH, initial calcium peroxide dosage, and temperature were studied with kinetic 
models applied, respectively. Based on the results, under conditions (pH=3.0, initial CP 
dosage= 3.0 g, Fe2+ as a catalyst, contact time= 60 minutes, 65℃), 97.07% degradation was 1100

degradation of methylene blue dye wastewater. Additionally, among the four kinetic models 
studied, the second-order kinetic model fitted the reactions well, and the BMG model was 
the most appropriate with the initial dosage and temperature study. To sum up, all effects 
gave a strong correlation toward the degradation of methylene blue. The Fenton-like process 
can be widely used to treat water discharge containing dyes such as methylene blue in an 
effective and less expensive approach compared to conventional processes.
