Chalk has a dichotomous porous system consisting of intra-
and inter-granular porosity. The intra-granular porosity isreferred to as the matrix porosity and is usually 35 to 50% ofthe volume (Burnham, 1990). It has a large air entry suction
and small, but relatively uniform pores, 0.1 to 1 μm in diameter
(Price, 1987) that result in a low matrix conductivity that istypically 5 to 8 mm/d (Mahmood-ul-Hassan and Gregory, 2002;Cooper et al., 1990). The pores of the matrix are sufficiently
small to store water against the force of gravity so that, evenin the unsaturated zone, most of the pores remain virtually
saturated during winter (Price et al., 1976).
The inter-granular porosity is referred to as the fissure poro-
sity and constitutes about 4% (Reeves, 1979) to 14%
(Mahmood-ul-Hassan, 1998) of the total porosity. The fissuresrange in diameter from 20 mm to 10 mm (Reeves, 1979) andprovide the pathways for rapid flow. Water and solutesmoving by this pathway do not move downward with thehorizontally-uniform wetting front found in the matrix but,
instead, travel rapidly through a small fraction of the total
volume bypassing much of the matrix (Arnon et al. , 2005;
Nativ et al.,  2003; Geake and Foster, 1989).Pak. J. Sci. Ind. Res. 2008 51(5) 235-241

Abstract.  The effects of different water application rates (3, 10, 15 and 30 mm/h) and of topsoil removal on the rate of
downward water movement through the cryoturbated chalk zone in southern England were investigated in situ.  During and
after each application of water, changes in water content and matric potential of the profile were monitored and percolatewas collected in troughs. The measured water breakthrough time showed that water moved to 1.2 m depth quickly (in8.2 h) even with application rate as low as 3 mm/h and that the time was only 3 h when water was applied at a rate of15 mm/ h. These breakthrough times were about 150 and 422 fold shorter, respectively, than those expected if the waterhad been conducted by the matrix alone. Percolate was collected in troughs within 3.5 h at 1.2 m depth when water wasapplied at 30 mm/h and the quantity collected indicated that a significant amount of the surface applied water moveddownward through inter-aggregate pores. The small increase in volumetric water content (about 3%) in excess of matrixwater content resulted in a large increase in pore water velocities, from 0.20 to 5.3 m/d. The presence of soil layer hadeffect on the time taken for water to travel through the cryoturbated chalk layer and in the soil layer, water took about1-2 h to pass thorough, depending on the intensity.

bPresent addressIn most of the chalklands of England, a shallow layer of well-
drained and structured soil directly overlies cryoturbated, frac-tured chalk. This soil can affect the route and rate of water
flow through the underlying chalk. In well-structured soils,
preferential flow of water can occur at application rates lowerthan that required for saturated flow (Radulovich et al., 1992),
so that there is the potential for the overlying soil to augment
the preferential flow through the underlying chalk. In suchsoils, vertical transmission of water through preferred paths
can occur during rainfall by either saturating the lower levels
of the soil and then passing through the fissures between thechalk fragments, or directly entering into the fissures if they
are, by chance, directly connected to the preferred path. How-
ever, there are also suggestions that the overlying soil mayreduce the opportunity for preferential flow through the
underlying chalk. For example, Gardner et al. (1990) reported
that rainfall intensity rarely exceeds a few millimetres per hourin south-east England and that this can be stored temporarily
in the overlying soil and weathered chalk materials near the
surface; this buffering capacity allows water to be released todeeper layers at rates low enough to be conducted by the
matrix alone.
The underlying fractured chalk has a very small water storage
capacity at potentials > -100 kPa (Cooper et al., 1990), which
means that steady state conditions are established quickly
235Physical Sciencesduring rain. Hence, if the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix
exceeds the flux from the soil into the chalk, flow will be through
the matrix. But, if the flux is larger than the matrix conductivity,
the excess will be carried by the fissure system. The flux out ofthe overlying soil into the fractured chalk and the hydraulic
conductivity of the chalk matrix are, then, key factors that
determine the partitioning of flow between the chalk matrixand the fissures.
This paper reports the results of a series of field experiments in
which known rates of water were applied to chalk with the soil
present or not. The objectives of this study were first, todetermine the effect of water application rate on preferential
flow through the chalk zone and second, to investigate the
role of the overlying shallow soil in controlling the pathwaysof water flow through the underlying chalk. Selected results
are presented in this paper from a larger study (Mahmood-ul-
Hassan, 1998).
Materials and Methods
Experimental site and instrumentation.  The experiments were
conducted in Ohio field at Bridgets Experimental HusbandryFarm, Winchester, Hampshire, UK (National Grid Reference
SU 517337). The soil was mapped as an Andover series rendzina
by Moffat (1985)-thin silty drift over chalk, comprising of about26 cm calcareous silty clay loam (well structured moderate to
fine subangular blocky overlying fractured upper chalk). The
underlying fractured upper chalk material, down to about1.5 m, was rubbly in nature and loose with many voids. Details
of the soil and site are given in Mahmood-ul-Hassan and
Gregory (2002). The experiments were conducted within a large(20 m x 60 m), long-term (> 5 years) grass plot. Two experimental
plots, each 3 m long and 1.5 m wide were established on either
side of a pit, approximately 1.4 m wide and 1.5 m deep dug forinstallation of instruments to observe rapid hydraulic changes
at different depths (Fig. 1). Another smaller plot (1.5 m x 1.4 m)
alongside the pit was also established and used to collectwater draining from different depths.
Theta probe type ML1, moisture sensors (Delta-T Devices,
Burwell, Cambridge, UK), were installed in duplicate on oppo-site sides of the pit on a diagonal line (Mahmood-ul-Hassan
and Gregory, 2002), about 0.25 m apart laterally and at 0.2, 0.4,
0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and 1.2 m below the ground level to monitor changesin soil water content. The calibration graph for silty clay loam
soil and upper chalk (Mahmood-ul-Hassan, 1998) was used to
convert the output of the theta probe to volumetric watercontent. Changes in soil matric potential were monitored
simultaneously using pressure transducer tensiometers
(SWT3, Delta-T devices). In both the plots, pressure trans-ducer tensiometers were installed 0.5 m away from the thetaprobe at 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and 1.2 m depths and spaced at
0.25 m intervals. Data from the theta probes and pressure
transducer tensiometers were logged using a Delta-T logger.
Rainfall simulator.  Water was applied to the plots with a
rainfall simulator consisting of a rectangular frame with sixparallel aluminium pipes each spaced 30 cm apart. Water jets
were mounted at 30 cm intervals along each aluminium pipe
and the whole system was mounted on a 1.5 m x 3 m frame. Theframe was moved across the plots on rails. Water from the jets
came out as fine spray and for that reason the sides of the
frame were covered with plastic sheets to prevent drift. Waterwas supplied to the simulator by a water pump at one end and
pressure was maintained, for a constant rain intensity, with a
gate valve fixed on the other end of the simulator. Surpluswater was drained to a water tank. Uniformity of application
was tested before and after the experiments for the three
different water application rates (10, 15 and 30 mm/h) by com-puting uniformity coefficient (C
u) expressed as Christian’s
coefficient (James, 1988);
            DCu = 100    1 -          Mn
where:
D is the deviation of the individual observation from the
mean value, M is the mean values of the observations
and n is the number of observations.
The coefficient ranged from 89 to 92% indicating an accept-
able uniformity of application.
Irrigation treatments.  Irrigation was applied either with
intensities of 10, 15 and 30 mm/h in pulses using the simulator236 M. Mahmood-ul-Hassan and P. J. Gregory

Pitor with an intensity of 3 mm/h using a 1 m long dribble bar
attached to a watering can. Irrigation was continued until
steady state conditions had been achieved.
Irrigation with an intensity of 3 mm/h was achieved by deli-
vering a total of about 24 mm water in 8.0 h. To achieve an
intensity of 10 mm/h, a total of 60 mm water was applied in a
period of 6 h. Similarly, 60 mm and 120 mm water was appliedin a period of 4 h for the 15 and 30 mm/h treatments, respec-
tively. After every irrigation, the plots were covered with
plastic sheeting to prevent evaporation and the profile allowedto drain for one week. Soil water content and matric potential
of the profile were monitored throughout.
The overlying soil (0.25 m layer) was then removed from both
experimental plots. After removing the soil, a thin layer of fine
sand was applied on the surface of the fractured chalk to even
out the distribution of water as well as to avoid the directentrance of water into the inter-granular pore spaces. Water
was applied manually at a rate of 3 mm/h using a dribble bar
and a total of about 24 mm of water was applied in 8.0 h. Theprofile was allowed to drain overnight and the next day the
experiment was repeated to observe the effects of antecedent
water content.
Collection of preferential flow.  Preferential flow was collected
at depths of 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 m in 80 cm long steel
channels (Fig. 2). The channels were 4.5 cm wide and 2 cmdeep with a perforated steel sheet attached inside the chan-
nels  about 0.5 cm above the bottom surface to facilitate water
flow. A sharpened chisel was fixed on the fore-end of thechannel to ease insertion into the chalk and a steel lid was
fixed on the end of the channel to stop water dropping into
the pit. Plastic tubing was used to run drainage from the steelchannels to plastic collectors. The channels were very care-
fully inserted into the chalk using a jack acting against the
opposite wall of the pit. The channels extended 65 cm intochalk and were inclined slightly towards the pit to aid
collection.Calculation of drainage, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity
and first breakthrough time.  Drainage flux, D, from each depth
was estimated using the water balance equation, assuming
vertical flow only and no surface run-off;
      z          z
D = R _ E
p + ∫ θ (t1)dz _ ∫ θ (t2)dz
       0           0
where:
R is the rainfall, Ep is the potential evaporation during the
period from t1 to t2 and θ is the water content of the profile
at time t1 and t2 at depth z. (during winter, the potential and
actual evaporation are same: Cooper et al., 1990).
The hydraulic conductivity was calculated from the drainage
fluxes and the measured gradient of hydraulic potentialusing the instantaneous profile method (Hillel et al., 1972).
The mean water flow velocity was calculated by dividing
drainage flux by the volumetric water content of respectivedepth. Saturated hydraulic conductivity of overlying soil
and of underlying chalk (of different depths) was measured
with a constant head using 10 cm long and 10 cm diameterundisturbed cores.
The measured first breakthrough time (MFBT) for a depth was
determined as the time from start of the water application tothe first appearance of water at the given depth, i.e., the time at
which the theta probe at that depth started to show an
increase in water content. The expected first breakthroughtime (EFBT) for each depth was calculated by dividing interval
of the distance by the mean water flow velocity of that depth.

tial and water content describes the hydraulic properties and

120 cmthe soil overlying chalk released a large amount of water ( ≈0.10
m3/m3) as potential decreased from 0 to -10 kPa; this water
represents the macroporosity. Less water was released from
the greater depths (0.6 and 1.2 m). The saturated hydraulicconductivity of soil (5.2 ± 0.42 m/day) was greater than that of
the underlying cryoturbated chalk (4.65 ± 0.24 and 3.35 ± 0.49
m/day at 0.4 and 0.6 m, respectively). Hydraulic conductivityas function of matric potential measured in situ  decreased
from ≈102 mm/d near saturation to ≈8 mm/d at -10 kPa.
Effect of rate of irrigation on water flow.  The measured first
breakthrough times at different rain intensities were shorter
than the expected first breakthrough times calculated as if
only the matrix were conducting (Table 1). This suggests thatwater flow through the overlying soil and underlying frac-
tured chalk was not piston type flow with a uniform wetting
front even at an application rate as low as 3 mm/h. Themeasured first breakthrough times for applications of 3mm/h
were, as expected, longer than those for 10, 15, and 30 mm/h at
all depths. The cumulative differences between breakthroughtimes at 3, 10 and 15 mm/h increased with depth and were
greatest at 1.2 m depth but the difference between 15 and
30 mm/h rain was small. There was no difference in thebreakthrough time at 0.2 and 0.4 m for applications of 10, 15,
and 30 mm/h. At 0.8, 1.0 and 1.2 m depth, the differences in
measured times between applications of 10 and 15 mm/h wereabout two fold, while at application of 15 and 30 mm/h there
was no difference except at 0.8 m depth.
The measured breakthrough times at different depths were
about 134 to 215 fold (at 3 mm/h
 intensity) and 430 to 872 times
(at 30 mm intensity) smaller than the EFBTs. The decrease in
breakthrough times as the rate of application increased wasmost likely due to the more rapid increase in volumetric water
content resulting in a large increase in hydraulic conductivity
(Fig. 4). At 1.2 m depth, for example, a 0.03 m
3/m3 increase involumetric water content (from 0.46 to 0.49 m3/m3) increased
the conductivity from about 8 mm/d to 110 mm/d. Similar
increases in conductivity for only small increases in watercontent were also observed at other depths (e.g., 0.6 m, Fig. 4).
As additional pores between fragments of chalk become
water filled, so the cross-sectional area available for flowincreases as does hydraulic conductivity (Hodnett and
Bell, 1990). For example, at 1.2 m depth, increasing the cross
sectional conducting area by 0.02 and 0.03 m
3/m3 (i.e., increa-
sing water content from 0.46 to 0.48 to 0.49 m3/m3) would
increase hydraulic conductivity from 8 mm/d to 57 and 110
mm/d thereby increasing water flow from 17.4 mm/d to 118.7and 224.5 mm/d, respectively. This 7 and 13 fold increase is a
direct consequence of water filling the pores between chalk
fragments. The additional flux resulting from the additionalwetted area as water content increased would raise the mean
flow velocity to 2.45 m/d at water content of 0.48 and to 5.3
m/d at 0.49 m
3/m3. A similar calculation for 0.6 m depth shows
that the flow rate was also similar (5.0 m/d) as water content
increased from 0.47 to 0.48 m3/m3. These calculated flow ratesTable 1.  Measured first breakthrough time (MFBT) compared

times observed and suggest that during rain storms, most of

rapidly.
Effect of overlying soil on water flow.  The time taken for water
to travel through fractured chalk (0.2 to 1.2 m depth) was
almost the same with and without the overlying soil but thesoil layer took about 2 h to pass through (Table 2). It was also
found in other experiments (unpublished) that water took
slightly more time to move through the top layer, 0-0.2 m, thanthrough underlying layers of the same thickness. At low rain
intensity, 3 mm/h, the initial breakthrough time for the soil
layer was 2 h, whereas, the time for all succeeding layers was1.5 h or less. At higher intensities, the time was 1 h for the top
0.2 m layer and 0.5 h or less for all deeper layers. The longer
time taken to pass through the top 0.2 m may have been due tothe surface conditions. In the case of overlying soil, there was
a layer of moss of about 2 cm thickness on the soil surface
under the grass. This may have reduced the infiltration rateinto the soil and hence delayed the initial breakthrough time.
Another possible factor that can reduce the flux is that at the
start of rain, loose soil material may move down with water andplug the macropores, thereby increasing the breakthrough
time. The longer breakthrough time through the top layer ofthe chalk even without the overlying soil might be due to the
trampling of the surface during the removal of overlying soil
in addition to the downward movement of soil particles. It is
clear that once water had passed through the overlying soil, itmoved quickly through the underlying chalk.
During winter, there were small changes in water content of
the chalk profile (Mahmood-ul-Hassan and Gregory, 2002).
Table 3 shows that the effect of water content at the start ofirrigation on the measured first breakthrough time was small.
In the upper 0.4 m, water content had a negligible effect on
breakthrough time but below 0.6 m, the time was reduced by1 to 1.5 h as water content increased.
Field measurement of preferential flow.  Table 4 shows the
rate of percolation at different depths as affected by the rate of
irrigation. The rate was calculated by dividing the volume of
water collected by the percolation collectors by the time inwhich it was collected. About 90% of the total percolate was
collected within 7 h when water was applied at 15 mm/h and
within 6 h when applied at 30 mm/h. Percolation started afterabout 1.5, 2.0. 2.5, 3.0 and 3.5 h at 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and 1.2 m
depth when water was applied at 30 mm/h. The quantity of
percolate collected suggests that at high rate of application, asignificant amount of the surface applied water moved downthrough the inter-aggregate pores. At 30 mm/h rate, about halfWater Flow Through Cryoturbated Chalk

fifth to 0.6 m and one tenth to 1.2 m depth at rates of 9.2, 4.0
and 1.6 mm/h, respectively. With 15 mm/h rain, the percentage
of applied water that percolated to 0.8 m was about half of thatat 30 mm/h and the rate was about 6 times lower. At 3 mm/h,
only a small fraction, 1.7%, of the applied water drained into
the trough at 0.6 m. The increase in the quantity of percolatedwater was not proportional to the increase in irrigation
intensity from 3 to 15mm/h. However, a proportional increase
(2 fold) in percolation to a depth of 0.8 m occurred as rainintensity increased from 15 to 30 mm/h.
Rainfall intensity or water application rate affects water
movement through a profile having macropores (Radulovichet al., 1992). Beven and Germann (1982) stated that when the
same volume of water is applied at higher intensity, it may rundeeper into the profile through the macropores. Resultsobtained from a column experiment by Edwards et al. (1992)
support the above statement. In this irrigation experiment, novisible ponding on the soil surface was observed, even withan application rate of 30 mm/h. The water was applied in pulses,each of 5 min duration with 10 min between pulses so that fora mean application rate of 30 mm/h, the actual intensity duringthe period of application was three times greater. It is widelythought that the soil must be close to or fully saturated, withwater ponded or nearly ponded on its surface, before prefe-rential flow can occur (Seyfried and Rao, 1987; Watson andLuxmoore, 1986). Nevertheless, it is also well established thatwell-structured materials like the over-lying soil and theunderlying fractured chalk at the experimental site have dualporosity. In a dual porosity medium, the intra-aggregateporosity has low infiltrability (in case of chalk it is usually5-8 mm/d) while the inter-aggregate porosity has highinfiltrability (14 m/d). In a well-structured soil, inter-aggregatepores are abundant and macropores, such as earthworm bur-rows and dead root channels may also be present. These poresand channels were especially abundant in the soil under studybecause it was under long-term grass that had not been tilledfor a long period. The pulsed application of water used inthese experiments exceeded, by a wide margin, the near satu-rated hydraulic conductivity of the soil and the chalk matrix.For example, the hydraulic conductivity of the overlying soiland fractured chalk measured in situ  decreased from ≈110
mm/d near saturation to about <8 mm/d at a matric potential≈-50 cm water (Mahmood-ul-Hassan and Gregory, 2002).
Once the hydraulic conductivity of the soil aggregate/chalk
fragments is exceeded, the surface of those aggregates/fragments becomes saturated and water flows around them
and moves downward through the inter-aggregate pore
network. Once the inter-aggregate pore network has startedto conduct water, a very small increase in water content can
then result in very large increase in hydraulic conductivity.
Thus, the overlying soil and underlying fractured chalk need
not be saturated for water to flow rapidly through the profile.
Freely draining water collected by the troughs at application
rates of 15 and 30 mm/h
 confirms the preferential flow pheno-
menon in the fractured chalk profile. However, insertion of thetrough may have disturbed the soil water pressure profile(boundary conditions) and therefore soil water movement. Forwater to drop into the trough, the boundary must be saturatedand, therefore, matric potential may be different to that inundisturbed chalk. Physical disruption and compaction (dueto insertion) may also affect flow in the preferential flow path.For example, local compaction may divert the preferentialmovement laterally rather than into the trough. Total avoid-ance of the disturbance of flow in situ  is very difficult if not
impossible. So the impact of the presence of the troughs andparticularly the effect on boundary conditions requiresfurther investigation.
Extensive inter-aggregate, non-capillary porosity is demon-
strated by the large and rapid decrease in water content(from ≈0.48 to 0.38 m
3/m3 at 0.2 m, ≈0.5 to 0.46 m3/m3 at 0.6 m
and ≈0.50 to 0.46 m3/m3 at 1.2 m (Fig. 3) and in hydraulic
conductivity as matric potential decreased from 0 to -10 kPa
(Mahmood-ul-Hassan and Gregory, 2002). The application ratesof water used in the experiments exceeded the matrix saturatedhydraulic conductivity of the soil overlying the cryoturbatedchalk. In another study on the same site, Mahmood-ul-Hassanand Gregory (2002) observed that most of the cryoturbated
chalk matrix remained close to saturation during winter and
hence had only a small additional ability to store water. A smallincrease in water content (1-3%, in excess of the usual matrixwater content) results in an exponential increase in hydraulicconductivity (Mahmood-ul-Hassan and Gregory, 2002;Radulovich et al., 1992; Hodnett and Bell, 1990). This implies
that any application of water that exceeds the capacity of the
matrix to conduct water would have to pass through thepreferred pathways.
The measurements show that preferential flow in macro-pores
occurred even at the lowest rate of 3 mm/h but that this was for
an effective duration of 8 h and a total application of 24 mm.
While events of this intensity and duration are not very com-mon, they do occur in southern England especially in winter
and summer storms. For example, in the two winters studied
by Mahmood-ul-Hassan (1998), rainfall intensity exceeded3 mm/h on several occasions and on at least two occasions in
each season, the total rainfall was >24 mm/6 h. In winter the
matrix remains close to saturation for prolonged periods so240

conductivity of the chalk matrix (0.4 mm/h) early breakthrough

Pancreatic α-amylase is an important enzyme needed for
starch hydrolysis in the small intestine of both nonruminants
and ruminants. Alpha amylase, an endoenzyme, hydrolyzes
α-1,4-glucosidic bonds in polyglucosans. The location of   the
bonds in the molecule to be hydrolyzed is selected at random;
each cleavage by α-amylase produces a reducing end (Walker
and Harmon, 1996).
The enzymes of amylase family have great significance due to
the wide area of their potential application. The spectrum of
amylase application has widened in many other fields, such asclinical, medicinal and analytical chemistry. Interestingly, the
first enzyme produced industrially in 1894 was an amylase
from fungal source, which was used as pharmaceutical aid fortreatment of digestive disorders (Pandey et al., 2000; Crueger
and Crueger, 1989). Amylases constitute a class of industrial
enzymes covering approximately 25% of the enzyme market(Sidhu et al., 1997). Amylase has also significant role in baking
industry, brewing industry, papermaking industry etc.
(Wojciechowsski et al. , 2001; Dauter et al., 1991; Fogarty and
Kelly, 1980).
Pancreatin contains pancreatic enzymes that function in the
digestion of starch, proteins and fats. It principally containsamylase, lipase and protease obtained from bovine pancreas.
The main objective of this study was to prepare pancreatin
in liquid and powder form. The extract was prepared fromcertified disease-free bovine pancreas without the addition
of other animal enzymes or fermentation enzyme products.
This preparation could be of value in the event of faultydigestion due to deficiency of pancreatic secretion and can
be used in different formulations of medicinal products in
pharmaceutical industry.Pak. J. Sci. Ind. Res. 2008 51(5) 242-244

Abstract.  The main objective of this study was to prepare pancreatin in liquid and powder form and to determine its
amylase activity in crude homogenate of animal tissue. Different conditions were optimized for estimation of maximalactivity including pH, temperature and substrate concentration. The optimum pH was found to be 6.8. The enzyme wasoptimally active at 50 °C. The effect of substrate concentration on enzyme activity was also studied and Km was found tobe 0.5%.

*Author for correspondence; E-mail: lubnaiqbal95@yahoo.comThe current study also deals with determination of amylase
activity in crude homogenate of animal tissue and optimiza-
tion of different conditions for estimation of maximal activity
including pH, temperature and substrate concentration.
Materials and Methods
Extraction.  Fresh bovine pancreas was purchased from local
market. It was washed, cut into small pieces, kneaded thor-
oughly with water and the liquid was strained. Eighty grams ofpancreas was placed in a flask of about 500 ml capacity and
200 ml of phosphate buffer (0.2 N, pH 6.8) was added. The
mixture was kept for two h with mixing by rotating at frequentintervals and then was homogenized in 200 ml of the same
buffer. After filtration of tissue homogenate, it was centrifuged
at 6000 rpm in order to remove remaining residue. Extractionwas repeated with another 50 ml phosphate buffer. This filtrate
was prepared as enzyme source and amylase activity was
determined by dinitrosalicylic acid reagent.
Drying techniques.  Various drying techniques have been
employed to concentrate extract from bovine pancreas like
vacuum oven drying, freeze-drying. It was found that vacuumoven drying is time consuming than the freeze-drying method
which is suitable as regards stability of the extract.
Enzyme assay.  Amylase activity was assayed by the Bernfield
method with slight modification. Assay was performed using
starch as substrate. The reaction mixture, containing 1.5 ml
substrate, 1 ml acetate buffer (pH 6.8), was preincubated at37 °C for three min. Enzyme (1:1000 diluted) was added and
then the tubes were incubated at 40 °C for 5 min. The reaction
was stopped by addition of 0.5 ml NaOH. After addition of1 ml dinitrosalicylic acid, the tubes were placed in boilingwater bath for 5 min. After cooling to room temperature, 9 ml
of distilled water was added and the absorbance was recorded
242at 540 nm. The level of amylase activity was determined by
measuring the reducing sugar released from soluble starch
(Bernfield, 1951).
Amylase activity unit was expressed as the micromoles of
maltose released per min under specified conditions of assay.
Optimal conditions for the enzyme activity were studied at
temperature, 20-70 °C, substrate concentration, 0.1% - 1.5%and pH, 4.0 - 8.5.
Results and Discussion
The amylase enzyme activity was studied in the crude extractof bovine pancreas and was found to be 9575 U/mg usingmodified method of Bernfield. Enzyme activity was found to
be directly related to the substrate concentration (Fig. 1).
There was gradual rise of activity with the increase in sub-strate concentration, up to 1% with no further increase in the
activity. According to Fig. 2, Km was found to be 0.5%. A
straight line is obtained when reciprocals of initial velocityare plotted against reciprocals of substrate concentration.The effect of temperature on amylase activity was determined
at different temperatures ranging from 20 to 70 °C. Enzyme
activity gradually increased with increase in temperature. The
maximum activity was achieved at 50 °C which may correspond
to the native confirmation, after which there is sharp decline in
activity with increase in temperature (Fig. 3). Comparable
study showed that as the temperature is increased beyond theoptimum temperature, the vibration energy of entire amylase
molecule also increases. This puts a strain on the weak inter-
actions that hold the enzyme together and change the nativeconfirmation of enzyme so the activity lessens (Borgstrom
et al., 1993). Another study explained the phenomenon of  de-
naturation concluding that at higher temperature all hydro-phobic and hydrophilic bonds are broken and the three
dimensional structure of protein destabilizes (Yamasaki, 2003).
Kinetic studies of amylase showed that enzyme is highly
active in pH range of 6-7. The optimum pH was found to be6.8 (Fig. 4). Suitable hydrogen concentration is attributed to
the formation of enzyme substrate complex. The activity of
enzyme falls on either side of the hydrogen ion concentration.The evidence shows that the range of pH of amylase varies
from source to source (Teles et al., 2004).243

pHExtracted pancreatins have wide applications in foods, bio-
technology and pharmaceutical industries. Use of the enzyme
reported in this study may have several advantages over the
existing state of the art, the most important being that it doesnot require such cost intensive filtrations to obtain microbe-
free preparations, thereby making it economically feasible.
Although bacterial and fungal amylases have already beenused as detergent additives, their main drawback is that they
require cost-intensive techniques to obtain microbe-free prepa-
rations (Phadtare et al., 1993). Moreover bovine pancreatin
can be easily available for commercial use.

Lubna Iqbal et al.Introduction
Many strains of Aspergillus niger  are well known for their
capacity to produce citric acid under suitable conditions. Bycareful selection of strains and improving conditions, 80 to
85% of initial sugar substrate can be converted into citric acid
(Kiel et al., 1981). Citric acid (CA) is a chemical commodity,
widely used in different industries. Inexpensive and readily
available raw materials remain in demand in industrial
processes. Molasses is a desirable raw material for citric acidfermentation due to its availability and relatively low price
(Lotfy et al., 2007; Haq et al., 2001; Pazouki et al., 2000).
Many investigators have tried to improve the production of
CA by various additives. Moyer (1953) found that methanol,
ethanol and isopropanol decreased growth but increased CA
production from cane and beet molasses. Since that time, a lotof work had been done to study the effect of alcohol on citric
acid fermentation (Lotfy et al., 2007; Roukas, 1999;  El-Batal
et al., 1995; Maddox et al., 1986; Szczodark and Ilczuk, 1975;
Hamissa, 1966).
Millis et al. (1963) increased CA yield by about 20-50% when
some natural oils with a high content of unsaturated fattyacids were added. Also, supplementation of surface culture
with some oil increases CA yield, using molasses medium
(Adham, 2002). Moreover, Barrington and Kim (2008) showedstatistically that olive oil has significant positive effect on
citric acid production.
Specific inhibitors such as fluoroacetate and iodoacetate, are
particularly useful (Peters, 1957; Racher and Krimsky, 1952).
Addition of some metabolic inhibitor to synthetic medium
stimulated citric acid production (Agrawal et al., 1983). Ali and
Haq (2005) discussed the role of different additives andPak. J. Sci. Ind. Res. 2008 51(5) 245-249

Abstract.  The effect of some metabolic inhibitors on citric acid (CA) production by Aspergillus niger  in cane molasses
medium was investigated. Addition of 0.01-0.1 mM iodoacetic acid and sodium arsenate, 0.05-1.0 mM sodium malonate,0.01 mM sodium azide, 0.01-0.05 mM sodium fluoride, 0.1-1.0 mM EDTA stimulated CA production (5-49%). Higherconcentrations (10 mM) of iodoacetic acid, sodium malonate and 0.5 mM sodium azide caused a complete inhibition offungal growth. Iodoacetic acid, sodium arsenate and sodium fluoride (0.2 mM) caused a remarkable inhibition of CAproduction. The implications of those preliminary functions was discussed.

production by A. niger using  different carbohydrate materials.
They found that both ethanol and coconut oil in 3.0% (v/w)
concentration increased citric acid production. Fluoracetateat a concentration of 1.0 mg/ml bagass increased the yield of
citric acid significantly. Also, addition of copper sulphate and
molybdenum sulphate remarkably enhanced the productionof citric acid using molasses medium.
The present study was undertaken mainly to determine the
effect of some metabolic inhibitors on citric acid production
by A. niger  in cane molasses medium.
Materials and Methods
Microorganisms and culture conditions.  Strains of A. niger
Van Tieghem 595, 599 were provided by the Centre of CultureCollection of Northern Regional Research Laboratory (NRRL),
USA. A. niger A10 and A20 were provided by the Center of
Culture Collection National Research Center (NRC), Egypt.A. niger  EMCC III, EMCC103 and EMCC 147 were obtained
from the Cairo Mercen (CAIM), Egypt.
The slants of A. niger were incubated in potato dextrose agar
(PDA) at 30 °C for 7 days. Inoculum was prepared from spore
suspension (10
5-106 spore/ml) in 0.01% v/v tween 80.
Cane molasses.  The cane molasses samples used in the present
study were kindly supplied by the cane sugar factory of Egypt.
Citric acid fermentation.  Fermentation media were prepared
by diluting cane molasses (CM) with tap water to approxi-
mately 15% sugar concentration. Preparation of molasses
was undertaken according to Mohamed and Adham (2003).Stationary cultures were grown on cane molasses media
containing different concentrations of the inhibitors and
incubated in slanting position (surface fermentation) at 30 °C
245for 15 days. Aliquots of the fermentation medium were
withdrawn on 4th, 8th and 12th day then analyzed for the total
titratable acidity and citric acid content. Maximum citric acid
content was reached on the 12th day of incubation.
Analytical techniques.  Citric acid was photometerically
determined at 420 nm as described by Lowenstein (1969).
Citric acid content was calculated as mg/ml sample withreference to the standard solution. Total titratable acidity
was estimated by titrating 1 ml aliquots of the fermentation
media against 0.1 M of NaOH solution and calculated asanhydrous citric acid; 1 ml of 0.1 M NaOH is equivalent to
6.4 mg anhydrous citric acid.
Growth was measured in terms of grams of dry weight of
mycelium per flask. At the end of the incubation period, on
the 15
th day, mycelial pads were separated, washed and dried
at 60 °C for  24 h.
Results and Discussion
Seven different strains of A. niger  were screened for citric
acid production ( A. niger  NRRL 599 and 595; A. niger  EMCCIII,
EMCC102 and EMCC147; A. niger  A10 and 20) using cane
molasses. A. niger  NRRL 599 exhibited the highest produc-
tion capacity and was selected for this study to get a preli-
minary idea of the metabolic reactions involved in theaccumulation of citric acid in cane molasses medium.
It should be reported that addition of 0.2 mM iodoacetate
inhibited fungal growth, total titrable acidity and citric acidproduction, while 1.0 mM concentration strongly inhibited
citric acid production and total titrable acidity by 85 and 67%,
respectively (Table 1). On the other hand, presence of 10 mMiodoacetic acid completely inhibited fungal growth. Lower
concentrations (0.01 and 0.1 mM), however, stimulated citricacid production by 34 and 41%, respectively, without mark-
edly affecting fungal growth and titratable acids.
Agrawal et al. (1983) demonstrated that addition of 0.001 to
0.1 mM iodoacetate to stationary cultures of A. niger  grown
on a synthetic medium stimulated citric acid production but
not total titratable acids and noted that the reason for the
enhancement of citric acid production at lower concentrationof iodoacetate is not clear. Iodoacetate has been reported to
be a rather specific inhibitor of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase, especially at concentration ≤ 1 mM. At higher
concentrations, other enzymes with sulphydryl groups at the
active sites are also affected (Webb, 1966). Hence, it is likely
that the interruption of the glycolytic cycle due to iodoacetateinhibition might be responsible for inhibition of fungal
growth and consequently, of citiric acid production (Agrawal
et al., 1983).
Addition of sodium malonate (Table 2) to the fermentation
medium inhibited the mycelial growth which in turn was
completely inhibited at 10 mM concentration and stimulatedcitric acid production (up to 27%) without affecting the total
titratable acidity. Berk et al. (1957) demonstrated that A. niger
possessed the ability to metabolize malonate. It is thus pos-sible that at low concentrations, malonate is completely
metabolized during the early period of fungal growth without
adversely affecting citric acid production. At these levelsprecisely, malonate has been shown to inhibit succinate
dehydrogenase, specifically in case of A. niger  (Tissieres,
1951). Because of this interruption in the tricarboxylic acidcycle, further metabolism of the produced citric acid is pro-
bably reduced, thereby leading to an increase in citric acid
accumulation in the medium (Agrawal et al., 1983). Barron
and Ghiretti (1953) reported 73% inhibition of citric acid
accumulation by yeast upon addition of high concentration
of malonate. This could be due to depression of succinateoxidation and reduction in the rate of acetyl CoA entry into
the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Webb, 1966).246

molasses medium completely inhibited fungal growth. On the
other hand, 0.1 mM, slightly inhibited citric acid production
but inhibited total titratable acidity significantly. The leastconcentration of sodium azide (0.01 mM) slightly stimulated
citric acid production (16%) and inhibited total titratable acid
(11%) and dry weight (17%). It is noticeable that the citric acidsecretion by A. niger  is not always parallel to the biomass
formation (Franz et al., 1993). Tissieres (1951) and Case and
Mcllwain (1951) observed inhibitory effects of sodium azideat 1.0 M concentration. This may be attributed to the inhibi-
tory effect of sodium azide on oxidative phosphorylation.sodium fluoride. This inhibition has been proposed to be due
to the fluoride ions and their ability to form complexes with
several metalloenzyme system.247
Lower levels of sodium arsenate (0.01-0.1 mM) stimulated the
production of the acid up to 32%. On the other hand higherlevels (0.2-1.0 mM) inhibited citric acid production, fungal
growth and the total titratable acidity markedly (Table 4). This
inhibition may be due to the fact that sodium arsenate is anuncoupler of substrate-linked phosphorylation_ for example,
during the oxidation of D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and
alpha-ketoglutarate_ leading to decreased energy production
in the cell and, hence, decreased growth (Sanadi et al., 1954;
Crane and Lipman, 1953). Glutarate-semialdehyde dehydro-
genase (EC 1.2.1.20) is more sensitive to sodium arsenate;this could explain the stimulation of citric acid accumulation
in the medium at lower concentration levels of sodium
arsenate (Agrawal et al., 1983).
Addition of sodium fluoride to the molasses significantly
stimulated citric acid production at 0.01 mM (49%) but was
inhibitory at concentrations ≥ 0.2 mM (16-58%) (Table 5). It
should be noted that the same concentration also suppressedthe total titratable acidity. However, fungal growth was
stimulated up to the concentration of 0.5 mM. At the highest
concentration of 10 mM, there was marked inhibition offungal growth, total titratable acidity and citric acid produc-
tion (56, 61 and 58%, respectively). Agrawal et al. (1983)
recorded 100% fungal inhibition in the presence of 10 mMAddition of (0.1, 1.0 mM) of the sodium salt of ethylene
diaminetetracetic acid (EDTA) stimulated citric acid produc-
tion, dry weight and total titratable acidity (Table 6). We havecame to a conclusion that any increase in the fungal growth
may lead to parallel increase in the total titratable acids but at
higher concentration (10 mM) inspite of the increase in thefungal growth (15%) there is considerable inhibition in the
production of the total titratable acids. Since more of the
glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes are dependenton metal ions (particularly Mg
2+) for their activity, it is likely
that at higher concentration (10 mM) EDTA chelate certain
metals ions essential for the activity of enzymes (directly orindirectly) related to the synthesis and  accumulation of citric
acid in the medium. Compared with other fungi, A. niger  can
be affected, to a greater extent, by the presence of metal ionsin the media (Franz et al., 1993).Table 3.  Effect of sodium azide on mycelial growth and citric

As discussed above, most of the studied inhibitors caused
inhibition of growth at concentrations, 1 to 10 mM, with the
exception of EDTA. It is likely that some of these inhibitorsmay affect the growth of the fungus and citric acid production
indirectly. Stimulation of fungal growth using different con-
centration of EDTA, may be due to the removal of excessmineral impurities from molasses by EDTA yielding more
suitable molasses for fungal growth and citric acid produc-
tion. However, 0.2 to 0.5 mM sodium fluoride could inhibitcitric acid production slightly without adversely affecting the
fungal growth. Also, there appeared to be a poor correlation
between the inhibitory effects on total titratable acidity andon citric acid production, total titratable acidity being more or
less susceptible to the inhibition.
In addition to citric acid, oxalic acid is a major contributor to
total titratable acidity. At lower levels, most of the studied
inhibitors stimulated citric acid accumulation in the medium,
but not the production of total titratable acidity, thus increas-ing the proportion of citric acid among other organic acids
formed. Perhaps lower levels of these inhibitors suppress the
activity of enzyme more closely associated with the synthesisof other organic acids, rather than activity of those concerned
with citric acid formation and accumulation in the medium.
These findings with the great viability of cane molasses couldhave important implications in industrial processes.

Seabuckthorn ( Hippophae rhamnoides ) is a thorny shrub,
found widely near streams, sandy places, mountainous and
coastal areas of many Asian and European countries (Ristoand Baoru, 2003). Natural habitat of seabuckthorn extends
widely in China, Mongolia, Russia, India, Nepal, Pakistan,
Ukraine, Great Britain, France and most parts of the northernEurope (Li and Shroeder, 1999). In Pakistan it is naturally
growing in the northern areas of Gilgit and Chitral.
Scientists have carried out extensive research on seabuckthorn
which has resulted in an improved understanding of the
health effects and chemical composition of the berry (Yang
and Kallio, 2002; 2001). The fruits of seabuckthorn are rich incarotenoids, lipids, ascorbic acid, tocopherols, sterols, flavo-
noids and triterpenes (Zhemin, 1990; Loskutova et al., 1989)
and are a rich source of both aqueous and lipophilic antioxi-dants due to the presence of vitamins D and E, as well as
enzymes such as various superoxide dismutase isoenzymes
(Eccleston et al., 2002).
Seabuckthorn is rich in oil both in seeds (seed oil) and in the
fruit soft parts i.e., flesh and peel (pulp oil). The observations
reveal that the seeds contain around 10% of  oil, whereas theoil content in the soft parts like pulp varies over a much wider
range from 0.5 to 21%, largely depending on the varieties and
the origin. The biological properties of fruits and oils ofH. rhamnoides  have been widely investigated. Oil extracted
from fruit has regenerating antiinflammatory and photo-
protective activity with promising applications in dermato-logy and cosmetics (Pintea et al., 2001). Seabuckthorn oil is
known to regulate immune functions and antagonize the
effects of immune suppressants (Yang and Kallio, 2001). InPak. J. Sci. Ind. Res. 2008 51(5) 250-253

Abstract.  For determining the chemical composition of seabuckthorn oil of different origins, samples of seabuckthorn
berries (red and yellow varieties) were collected from different locations of northern areas of Pakistan. Among eightdifferent fatty acids, palmitoleic acid (32.4%) and palmitic acid (36.52 %) were found to be the major fatty acids presentalong with other important fatty acids i.e., oleic acid (37.07%), linoleic acid (12.36%) and linolenic acid (0.73%). Quantitiesof unsaturated fatty acids were higher than that of saturated analogues.

reduce the immune suppressive and hematoxic effect ofchemotherapy and radiation therapy.
Seabuckthorn seed and pulp oils combined have high level
of beneficial fatty acids. The fatty acid profile of the oil
showed that it contained nearly 90% unsaturated fat. It is
high in both linolenic and linoleic acids. The high level of
unsaturated fats makes seabuckthorn oil appropriate for
decreasing the risk of heart diseases (Yang, 1995). Berry oil
of seabuckthorn contains 35-40% of a 16 carbon monosatura-
ted fatty acid called palmitoleic acid also known as omega-7.
Palmitoleic acid is believed to possess potent antiviral, anti-
bacterial and healing effects in humans (Parimelazhagan
et al., 2005).
In medicinal industry about ten varieties of seabuckthorn
drugs have been developed and are available in the form of
liquid, powder, plasters, pills, liniments and aerosols etc.
These drugs are used for treating burns, gastric ulcer, scales,
oral mucositis, rectal mucositis, cervical erosion, radiation
damage, skin ulcers caused by malnutrition and other
damages relating to the skin (Ge, 1992). The most important
pharmacological function of seabuckthorn oil is in dimini-
shing inflammation, disinfecting bacteria, relieving pain
and promoting regeneration of tissues. The chemical and
phytochemical composition of seabuckthorn varies with the
origin, climate and method of extraction. (Zeb, 2004; Beveridge
et al., 1999). Present studies were carried out to analyze the
physicochemical composition and fatty acid profile of oil of
seabuckthorn berries collected from different altitudes of the
northern areas of Pakistan by gas chromatography techniques
because data in this respect is not available in the literature.
250Materials and Methods
Extraction of oil.  Red and yellow varieties of berries of
H. rhamnoides  were collected from six different locations i.e.,
Nomal, Bagrote, Ghizar, Skardu Khas, Shigar and Khaplu andstored at -20 °C. Seeds were separated from frozen berries bypressing the juice and the residue was dried at room tempera-ture. The pulp portion was also dried and oil was extracted by
the cold press method yielding pure, chemical and solvent
free oil.
The extracted oil was analyzed for refractive index, specific
gravity, saponification value, unsaponifiable matter, acid
value, iodine value and peroxide value according to standard
methods (AOAC, 2000). Methyl esters of fatty acids were
also prepared by standard methods (AOCS, 2000). Fatty
acids were saponified by treating with 0.5M methanolic
NaOH solution. After acidification with 2M HCl to pH 4-5,
fatty acids were extracted with chloroform and the solvent
was then evaporated under reduced pressure and tempera-
ture. The extracts were applied to TLC plates. Areas of silica
gel corresponding to fatty acids were extracted from the
plates with chloroform and then trans -esterified with boron
trifluoride-methanol for 30 min at 80 °C. Methyl esters of fatty
acids were dissolved in n-hexane and analysed by GC on a
Perkin Elmer gas chromatograph (8410 series) using tempera-
ture programme with FID. Fused silica capillary column (25 m x
0.32 mm id, 0.15 μm film thickness) was used. Oven tempera-
ture was held at 65 °C for 5 min, then programmed at 5 °C/min
up to 220 °C. The carrier gas was nitrogen with 1.5 ml/min flow
rate. Injection and detector temperature was 250 °C. Split ratio
was 1:20 and injection volume was 0.5 μl. Identification of
the fatty acid methyl esters was carried out from the retention
times compared to standards.
Results and Discussion
Physicochemical characteristics of oil of yellow and red
varieties of seabuckthorn are given in Table 1. The values are
mean of three independent readings.
Refractive index and optical rotation are very stable parameters
and can be used for checking the identity of oils. Refractive
indices of all the samples analyzed were almost the same, with
insignificant differences. Maximum specific gravity of yellow
variety was observed in samples collected from Nomal (0.951)
while lowest value was observed in the samples from Skardu
khas (0.855). The highest specific gravity of red variety (0.913)
was observed in samples from Khaplu area while the lowest
value (0.846) was observed in the samples collected from
Ghizar. Acid values and peroxide values of the samples werequantified which were in accordance with the reported para-
meters and were within the range of reported data (Morsel andSteen, 2003).
Saponification value is the index of mean molecular weight of
triglycerides comprising of fats. The highest saponification
value was observed in oil from Bagrote (229.20), while the
lowest was observed in the oil from Skardu Khas sample(186.20). Unsaponifiable matter mainly consists of soluble
vitamins, pigments (i.e., carotene and lycopene), steroids,
alcohols and hydrocarbons. Oil from Shigar had maximumvalue of unsaponifiable matter (3.60), while that from Khaplu
had minimum value (0.6). It means that the former contained
the highest amount of bioactive substances as compared toother samples. Iodine value is the measure of degree of
unsaturation in oil or fat. Samples from Nomal had maximum
Iodine value (70,71).
Fatty acid composition of seeds and berries of H. rhamnoides
growing in different regions of the world has been extensively
studied (Pintea et al., 2001; Kallio et al., 2000; Loskutova et al.,
1989; Stanescu et al., 1989). In general, fatty acid composition
of the oil from berries has been reported to be rich in palmitic
and palmitoleic acids as well as in oleic, linoleic and linolenicacids (Cakir, 2004; Qibikeva, 1989). Our results are in agreement251

were characterized by higher content of linoleic (12.36%),oleic (37.07%) and linolenic acids (0.73%) and the lowest
percentage of palmitoleic acid (12.41%) as compared to other
locations (Table 2). Yang and Kallio (2002; 2001) have reportedsimilar observations. According to them, in the oil of whole
berries, the proportion of palmitoleic acid correlates negatively
with the proportion of linoleic and linolenic acids. It is clearfrom Table 2 that Bagrote oil sample has the highest percent-
age of palmitoleic acid (32.41%) and the lowest percentage of
linolenic (0.1%) and linoleic acids (5.86%). These essentialfatty acids play an important role in the prevention of heart
diseases and cancer and improve overall immune system
(Chai et al., 1989). Because of their effect on immunity, linoleic
acid may have a useful role in treating disorders relating to
hyper-stimulation of immune response (such as rheumatoid
arthritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, system lupus etc.).
The results showed that all samples were rich in high amounts
of polyunsaturated fatty acids as compared to the saturated
analogues.
Conclusion
Seabuckthorn is known as unique source of high valued oils.
The oil of seabuckthorn has general nourishing, revitalizing,
and restorative action. Its oil is a rich source of unsaturatedfatty acids, phytosterols, carotenoids and flavonoides. Oil
samples of seabuckthorn berries, collected from different
altitudes of Skardu and Gilgit, have shown high concentrationof palmitoleic acid, which differentiates it from most other oils
of plant origin. In addition the oil of whole berries contains
especially high level of caroteniods. The percentage of fattyacid varies depending on the area from where samples had
been collected. All oil samples were rich in polyunsaturated
fatty acids. The oil of berries collected from Shigar had highpercentage of omega-3 and omega-6, while that from Bagrotearea was high in palmitoleic acid. The results showed that
concentration of polmitoleic acid and palmitic acid of purepulp oil was greater than that of the saturated fatty acids.
Density and refractive index are very stable parameters and
may be used for checking the identity of oils. Triglyceridecontents ensure the quality of oils. It is believed that imba-
lance in these vital essential fatty acids in our diet is the major
reason for high incidence of heart diseases, hypertension,diabetes, obesity, colitis, premature aging and some types of
Cancer (Eccleston et al., 2002).

Abstract. Lac dye aleuritic acid extracted from seed lac, when applied onto leather, using post-mordanting process
showed good results. Among acetic acid, formic acid and alum, acetic acid at 0.1 M concentration proved to be the bestmordant and gave excellent colour fastness to washing, light and rubbing and good tensile strength.
Keywords:  lac dye, mordant, leather, aleuritic acid.
Introduction
Lac ( Laccifer lacca ) are small insects attached in large num-
bers to the plants and the trees and drain sap from the bark of
host tree and secret lac resin (Kongkachuichay et al.,  2002a,
2002b). The resin is scrapped off and separated into shellac,
wax and lac colour. Ovaries of the insect contain crimson fluid
called lac dye which has two major components: laccaic acid Aand B whose structures are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respec-
tively (Chairat et al.,  2008; Kamel et al.,  2005; Janhom et al.,
2004). Laccaic acid represent approximately 0.5-0.75 % byweight of stick lac (Lili et al.,  1999).Natural dyes have been used in textile processing since long
but their application to natural leather has been extremely rare(Kumar and Sinha, 2004). Recent observations of the hazard-
ous effects of benzidine compounds on mammals, even in
very low amounts, have boosted the interest in natural dye-stuffs.
Most of the natural red colour dyes have high solubility in
water, therefore, the colour fastness to washing of the dyedleather is quite low (Rattanaphani et al.,  2007). In order to
improve the colour fastness quality of the dyes, most dyeing
processes are conducted using different mordants such asacetic acid, formic acid and alum. Depending on the type of
dye and mordant used the colour fastness to washing is re-
ported to be in the range of 3 to 5 for colour change, and 3-4 to5 for staining (Waheed and Alam, 2004).
Materials and Methods
General procedure. Goat wet blue leather was used for the
experiment and was dyed using the microdrum assembly with
programmes to control temperature, time and speed of circula-
tion of solution. The dyed leather samples were tested forcolour fastness to washing using Launderometer, fastness to
light using Xenon weatherometer, fastness to circular rubbing
using rub fastness tester, for tensile strength material testingmachine was used. Standard test methods for leather of the
Society of Leather Technologists and Chemists (SLTC) were
followed in all cases.
Leather, dyes and mordants.  The leather used was collected
from a local tannery of Sialkot. One kg of stick lac was ground
into coarse powder. Ten litres of water were added and thesolution was stirred and left standing for 24 h. After filtration,
a reddish solution of lac dye was obtained. The lac dye solu-
tion was kept cold for further use. Three different types ofmordants were used as follows: 0.1 M acetic acid, 0.1 M formic
acid and 0.1 M alum.The deep interest of Pakistan leather industry in environment
friendly leather processing techniques, has led to increased
efforts to develop chrome-free tanning agents and to find ways
to use natural dyestuffs, which previously had applications inthe textile industry (Kamel et al.,  2007; Haroun, 2005; Kim et
al., 2003).

Dyeing with lac dye using different mordants. Different
mordants including 0.1 M acetic acid, 0.1 M formic acid and 0.1
M alum were used for lac dyeing of leather by the
postmordanting method. The leather sample was first dyedwith a solution of lac dye at 100 
oC with a motor speed of 750
rpm per h, then the solution of mordant was added to lac dye
solution in the ratio of 1:3 v/v for 30-50 min.
The concentration of the remaining dye solution and the
amount of dye absorbed on the leather were calculated from
the measured absorbance of dye solution at 520 nm (UV-VISspectrophotometer, Spectronic Unicam) before and after dye-
ing of leather. The dyed samples were next tested for colour
fastness to light, to washing and to rubbing and the tensilestrength.
Dyeing by changing temperature and time. Leather (20 g) was
dyed in a 2 litre solution of lac dye and 0.1 M acetic acid aspreviously described. The dyeing temperature was 60 
o, 80 o
and 100 oC and the time was varied from 30 to 240 min. The
dyed samples were then tested for colour fastness to wash-ing, light, rubbing and the tensile strength.
Results and Discussion
Effect of mordants on dye absorption: Effects of different types
of mordants on absorbance of dye by leather at different tem-peratures are shown in Table 1. Highest absorbance of dye
was observed when acetic acid was used as mordant. The
amount was approximately 15% and 30% higher than valuesobtained with formic acid and alum, respectively. The use of
acetic acid as mordant offers an environment friendly alterna-
tive to the metal mordanted natural dyeing process (Vankar et
al., 2007).
Effect of mordants on physical properties. Comparison of
dyeing techniques showed that post-mordanting method gave
the highest depth of shade (Deo and Desai, 1999). Using thistechnique acetic acid, formic acid and alum were applied for
the lac dyeing of leather. It was observed that type of mor-dants influenced the quality level and tensile strength of the
dyed leather samples (Table 2). Use of acetic acid yielded the
greatest tensile strength while 0.1 M alum showed the lowestoverall tensile strength. Colour quality such as fastness to
washing, fastness to light and fastness to rubbing of finished
leather sample was excellent when acetic acid was used asmordant and poor with 0.1 M alum (Janhom et al.,  2006).
Effect of dyeing conditions on quality of leather. Dyeing
temperature and time are important parameters which influ-
ence the quality of dyed samples. Since acetic acid was
observed to be the best mordant, the effect of temperatureranging from 60 
o to 100 oC for 30 to 200 min on dyeing with
post-mordanting method using acetic acid as mordant was
studied (Table 3). Almost all leather samples had excellent qual-ity of staining on standard cloth and felt pad (level 5) except in
case of rubbing, where the level decreased to 4-5. Neither
dyeing temperature nor dyeing time had any effect on qualityof staining; however, the dyeing time seemed to affect the
colour change and fastness to light to some extent (Akalin et
al., 2004). Dyeing leather at 60 
o to 100 oC for longer than 80 min
showed no further improvement in colour change and fast-
ness to light, as the quality level slightly decreased after 80
minutes of dyeing.

Environmental pollution is causing widespread concern and
has become an important area of interest in the field ofmodern research. The costs of pollution control are extremelyhigh. Steward and Towse, back in 1984, estimated the annualcost in the United States alone, to be close to 5 billion dollars,
in addition to occurrence of thousands of deaths and diseases
due to pollution. Industries produce huge amounts of wastes.Careless disposal of these wastes to the environment withouttreatment threatens natural habitat and poses real dangers tohumans, flora and fauna. Thus it is highly necessary to knowthe composition of individual wastes and develop the most
economical way to treat all wastes (wastewaters and sludge),
recycle the water, reclaim the waste chemicals and findpossible applications of the treated wastes so as to ensure asafe environment.
The present research work is aimed at characterizing sludge
of selected industries, assessing the degree of pollution causedby the sludge, developing simple and efficient treatment meth-ods helpful in determining the efficiency of treatment of the
sludge in terms of solid reduction, BOD and COD reduction,
nitrification and denitrification, reuse or applicability of thetreated sludge, the disposal option(s) most convenient for theunused waste and assessing the efficiency of the treatment
methods adopted for particular sludge and for end-use
applications.
Materials and Methods
Industrial sludges. The sludge used in this study was obtained
from a textile processing factory located in Isolo, Lagos  which
manufactures mostly cotton fabrics. Main products of thefactory are superprint, guarantee-superprint and minibrocade.
The factory consists of various departments, which carry outdifferent operations and produce different types of wastewa-ter, containing acids used in desizing and dyeing and bases
like caustic soda used in scouring and mercerization. They
also contain inorganic chlorine compounds and other oxidantse.g., hypochlorite of sodium, hydrogen peroxide and perace-tic acid used for bleaching and other oxidative applications.Organic compounds were also present e.g., dyestuff, opticalbleachers, finishing chemicals, starch and related synthetic
polymers used for sizing and thickening, surface active chemi-
cals used as wetting and dispersing agents, and enzymes fordesizing and degumming. Heavy metal salts present includede.g.,  copper, zinc salt and iron (III) chloride used as printingingredients. All these wastes are passed into an effluent tankand then into a drainage system as shown in the flow chart
(Fig.1).
Sampling of sludge. Composite samples of the sludge were
obtained from primary sedimentation tanks of the factoryPak. J. Sci. Ind. Res. 2008 51(5) 258-263
Abstract. Analysis of sludge samples of a textile processing factory revealed that the BOD and COD as well as the
levels of total solids, nitrogen and phosphorus contents of sludge liquor were high needing treatment before disposalor reuse. Detention time of 60 days was established for aerobic treatment of the sludge. Optimum dosage for physico-chemical methods were established at 4 g/l, using alum and iron III chloride each and 15.5 g/l and 550 mg/l, for limeand polyelectrolyte each. Solids were reduced by 67%, through aerobic and 61% through anaerobic digestion, whilethe sludge treated by physicochemical method had higher solid content, recording the highest increase with lime.

258Seven plastic bowls of one litre capacity each were used to
collect samples manually over 12 h sampling period, at 2 hintervals during 7. 00 a.m. to 7.00 p.m- this being the peak
(optimum) period for work and sampling was the most con-
venient during this period.
Composite samples were collected from the factory once a
week for seven weeks and analyzed. If analysis could not becarried out immediately, samples were preserved in a refrig-erator maintained at 4 °C. At this temperature, biodegrada-
tion is inhibited.
Samples were collected on different week days to account for
the cyclic and intermittent variations occurring at the work site.
Treatment of sludge. Sludge samples were treated employing
different methods viz., aerobic, anaerobic, physicochemical,
combined aerobic/physicochemical and combined anaerobic/
physicochemical methods. (Asia et al., 2006 ; Asia and Ademoroti,
2005, 2004, 2002; Asia and Oladoja, 2003; Asia, 2000).
Methods of analysis. All samples were analyzed as described
by Ademoroti (1996) and APHA (1995). When immediateanalysis was not possible, the samples were preserved at 4 °Cto inhibit biodegradation.
All the reagents used for the analysis were of analytical grade
and obtained from BDH Chemicals Ltd., Poole, England.
Results and Discussion
Characteristics of fresh sludge are shown in Table 1 and 2.Fresh sludge was alkaline with the pH of 8.91 and hadspecific gravity of 1.01, showing high moisture content (97%)i.e., 3% solid concentration. The turbidity of 2460 NTU
indicates large amount of colloidal matter or high solid con-
centration. The high turbidity may be due to colour impact ofvarious dyes used for fabric dyeing. Also, the total, suspendedand volatile solids were relatively high. The sludge contained6500 mg/kg TS, 3158 mg/kg SS and 4150 mg/kg VS; BODand COD were 550 and 1694 mg/l, respectively; COD:BOD
ratio was 3.08, This indicates that the sludge is capable of
undergoing about 50-90% substrate biodegradation. Organicmatter can undergo about 50-90% substrate biodegradation ifits COD : BOD ratio ranges between 2 and 3.5 (Quano et al. ,
1978); thus, aerobic and anaerobic digestion of the sludge bybiological methods is possible. The conductivity values of
148 S/cm indicates presence of mobile ions suggesting that
physicochemical method can be as well used for treatment ofthe sludge.
Nitrogen present in the sludge is more in ammoniacal
form (Table 1). Consequently, if  such a sludge is dischargedto the environment, depletion in the oxygen resources of theTable 1.  Characteristics of fresh sludge liquor of textile pro-

to nitrate by some groups of bacteria. This necessitatesappropriate treatment of sludge before its discharge. Thus the
resulting nitrates and phosphates (inorganic nutrients) could
be a boost to the plant and the algal growth. Concentrations aslow as 0.01 mg/l of phosphorous and 0.1 mg/l of nitrate maybe sufficient for eutrophication when other elements are inexcess (Henry and Heinke, 1989).
Effect of sludge age on pH during aerobic digestion.  The effect
of age of sludge on its pH during aerobic digestion is shown in
Fig. 2. The sludge detention time for textile processing sludge
was 60 days. The steady pH during this period was due tocomplete stabilization during aerobic biodegradation. Sludgedetention time is dependent on temperature and hence on theclimatic conditions prevailing in the area.
Characteristics of aerobic and anaerobic digested sludge.
Some parameters that affect biological processes are shown
in Table 2. A pH drop was observed for the sludge treated byaerobic and anaerobic biological methods. After digestion,it was found that pH of the sludge dropped from 8.91 to 5.81and from 8.91 to 5.60 for aerobic and anaerobic systems,respectively. The drop in pH could have occurred due to the
digestion products. Two products of aerobic digestion
suspected for lowering the digester pH are carbon (IV) oxideand hydrogen ions.
C
5H7NO2  + 7O2 + bacteria   →  5CO2 + 3H2O + NO3 + H+
In the case of anaerobic system, the depression in pH was due
to the volatile acids released into the digestion medium. The
microbes in the digester convert the organic content of the

The reaction products (acids and CO2) raise the acidic levels
in the digester thereby lowering the pH.

Dose (g/l) COD reduction (%)analysis, COD was chosen to assess the degree of treatment
as there is a correlation between COD on one hand and BOD,SS and TS on the other hand  (Ademoroti, 1980). The opti-
mum coagulant dosages established were 4g/l for alum and
iron (III) chloride, each, 13.5 g/l for lime and 550 mg/l forpolyelectrolyte.
The solids. The amount of solids present in raw sludge and
sludge treated aerobically, anaerobically, physicochemicallyand by combined methods are shown in Fig. 4.
Solid reduction of about 59% TS, 67% SS and 62% VS were
achieved for aerobic system and 61% TS, 68% SS and 51%VS, for anaerobic system. The ash produced here was 38%and 33% of total solids for aerobic and anaerobic processes,respectively.
The products of the anaerobic digestion process are methane
gas and carbon (IV) oxide; both are burnable gases termedbiogas which, if harnessed, may be used as useful fuel forheating purpose and for powering industrial plants.
Oxygen demand values. The results of the oxygen demand
concentrations of raw and treated sludge are shown in Fig. 5.
The BOD and COD values of fresh sludge of textile process-The anaerobic treatment method increased the total
nitrogen content of the sludge. The increase in total nitrogenin the case of the anaerobic system may be attributed to theaddition of (urea), a nutrient supplement also for the micro-bial population in the processed sludge enabling completion
of the digestion process.
Phosphorus concentration. Results for phosphorus concen-
trations of treated sludge (liquor and cakes) are shown inFig. 7. Sludge treated through biological aerobic systemshad higher phosphorous concentrations while the concen-tration in the liquor decreased to the tune of 5-12 percent.
On the other hand, the anaerobically treated sludge had
significant reduction of about 37-53 percent in the sludgecake while the liquor was heavily laden with phosphorouswith an increase of about 55-64 percent. This may be attri-buted to the solubilization of phosphorus during anaerobicdigestion process.  Pitman (1992) and Pitman et al.  (1991)
confirmed that sludge handling liquors from biological
nutrient removal plants with anaerobic digesters containedhigh phosphorus concentrations.261

ing industry were 550 and 1694 mg/l, respectively. However,
after aerobic treatment, BOD and COD reduction of about 87and 90%, was respectively achieved.
The anaerobic systems yielded a BOD and COD reduction of
89 and 90 percent, respectively.
Nitrogen amount. Nitrogen content of raw and treated
textile sludge was 66.8 and 50.9 mg/l, respectively (Fig.6).Aerobic treatment of the sludge resulted in about 33-49%reduction. This could have resulted from oxidation of some
ammonium nitrogen (which contributed substantially to the
total nitrogen) to nitrate through nitrification, raising thenitrate level of aerobically treated sludge.

Treatment methods
Treatment methodsTreatment methodsNPK (fertilizer) values. The levels of nitrogen, phosphorus
and potassium have to be critical if the sludge is to be used for
agricultural purposes (Sommers, 1977). The fertilizer valueof sludge is detected by the percentage concentration ofnitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK); typical NPKfertilizer has a composition of 8% N, 8% P and 8% K. It maybe difficult to achieve these levels of nutrients in sludge. It
was observed that the studied sludge had definite fertilizer
values (Fig. 8). It had a concentration of 2.6% N, 0.5% P and0.6% K. The anaerobically digested sludge had N,P,Kconcentrations of  9%, 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively.  If thesenutrient concentrations are improved through some suitablecomplementary method such as composting, the sludge could
be used to fertilize and condition soil. Humid material in the
sludge improves the physical properties and cation exchangecapacity of the soil.iron (III) chloride treated sludge. Polyelectrolyte treated
sludge had only a marginal increase in the sludge solids. Theincrease in total solids (TS) was in the range of 14-23.7
percent for iron (III) chloride treated sludge, 21-25 percent
for alum and 25-29.5 percent for lime treated one. Suspendedsolids (SS) also increased in the range of 4.2-19.7 percentfor iron (III) chloride, 17.5-24.3 percent for alum and 14-25.9 percent for lime treated sludge. V olatile solids (VS),however, decreased in all types of sludge treated with
chemical coagulants. Polyelectrolyte flocculant, however,
improved the volatile content of sludge, thereby enhancingthe biogas (fuel value) production of the sludge.
Oxygen demand values . The percentage BOD and COD
reduction achieved in the physicochemical method was inthe range of 88-92.6 and 89-92.8 percent, respectively. The
phy-sicochemical methods were more effective in terms of
BOD and COD removal than the biological systems (Fig.5).
Nitrogens amount.  The total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN),
ammonia nitrogen (NH
3-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) and
organic nitrogen (org.-N) were reduced in all the samples, morebeing in the sludge treated with lime.
Phosphorus concentration . The sludge solids contained
higher concentration of phosphorus than the fresh sludge whilethe liquors were almost free of phosphorus (Fig. 7). About90-93 percent phosphorus was removed from the liquor.
NPK values . Physicochemically treated sludge had little
fertilizer values. However, the fertilizer values of raw sludgewere higher than the physicochemically treated one.
Combined biological and physicochemical methods of
treatment: The solids . It was found that the combined
aerobic/physicochemically treated sludge had solid reductionranging from 19.4-27.8 percent total solids, 27-35 percentsuspended solids and 36-49 percent volatile solids.
Percentage solid reduction achieved using combined aerobic/
physicochemical treatment of sludge was not as high as eitherthe aerobic or the anaerobic method and so, for reduction insludge quantity, either of the biological methods is more promi-sing than the combined one.
The anaerobic/physicochemical method resulted in better  solid
reduction comparable to the combined aerobic/physicochemi-cal method, the former being in the range of 26.2-29.4percent TS, 24-28.4 percent SS and 31.3-37 percent VS;
however, this method may not be preferred to any of the
biological methods in terms of solid reduction. The lime treatedbiological sludge had the least amount of solids reduced.
Oxygen demand values . The combined biological and physi-
cochemical treatment methods proved more efficientFig. 8. NPK concentration of raw and treated textile

Physicochemical method of treatment. The solids . The
quantities of sludge were found to increase for all coagu-
lants used in the treatment.  A common trend noticed was
that the lime treated sludge had more quantity of s olids than
the alum treated one, which in turn had more solids than262

Kthan either the biological or the physicochemical method
individually in terms of BOD and COD reduction. About
96.1-98.2 percent BOD and 96.8-98.4 percent COD reduc-
tion was achieved for aerobic/physicochemically treated
sludge, while 96.8-98.8 percent BOD and 96.8-98.9 percentCOD reduction was achieved by the combined method.
Nitrogen.  There was considerable reduction in the nitrogen
content of the treated sludge. The highest reduction wasnoticed in lime treated aerobic sludge. Ammonia nitrogenreduction of this sludge was about 85.2-93.3 percent. This may
be due to the nitrification process during the digestion stage
while ammonia was further reduced by the physicochemicaltreatment. Total nitrogen was also reduced in the sludge using
the combined aerobic/physicochemical method, in the range of74.5-87.6 percent. The highest reduction occured in the limetreated aerobic sludge thus lime is a better coagulant for nitro-
gen removal from aerobically digested sludge.
In combined anaerobic/physicochemically treated sludge,
ammonia nitrogen concentration increased considerably withother coagulants and was reduced in lime treated anaerobicsludge whereas nitrate nitrogen was reduced to zero.
Phosphorus . The results revealed that, the combined anaero-
bic/physicochemical method can be used to reduce phospho-rus both in the sludge cake and in the liquor. This method is
the best choice if complete disposal of sludge is intended with
removal of nitrates and phosphates.
NPK values.  Sludge treated by combined anaerobic/physico-
chemical method had reduced NPK concentration, (Fig. 8)
lower even than the raw sludge. Therefore, for improvement in
fertilizer value, this method is not recommended.
Conclusion
Proper sludge management requires an understanding of
the place of origin of the sludge within the wastewater
treatment process, the age and characteristics of the sludge,
various methods available for sludge treatment, the economicpotential of treated and untreated sludge and the disposaloptions available for the unused waste.
The final destination of the sludge will determine degree of the
treatment required and the effect on the environment.
For landfill, composting, brick making and incineration, it is
unnecessary and undesirable to biologically digest the sludge
as heat value of the sludge might be lost as biogas.
For land application of sludge, physicochemical treatment
offers a very promising result as sludge solids contain substan-tial amount of adsorbed phosphate as apatite e.g., calciumhydroxyl apatite, Ca
5OH (PO4)3 in the lime treated sludge.Biological treatment methods (aerobic and anaerobic) can be
used to reduce the quantity of solids in the sludge generatedby industrial processes before disposal.
Aerobic biological method and the combined aerobic/physico-
chemical method are good options for ammonia reduction.
The anaerobic method is the best if phosphorous removal fromsludge solids is intended before disposal of the solids.
The basic nutrients in sludge, nitrates and phosphates are best
removed by the combined anaerobic/physicochemical method.Thus, for prevention of eutrophication of water bodies, thismethod of treatment is more promising.

The incidence of fungal infections has lately increased due
to the resistance of the causative microbes to the antifungalmedicines (Turan-Zitouni et al., 2005) as well as the increased
number of immune persons taking chemotherapy for various
types of cancer or HIV infection (Sionov et al., 2005). Hence,
there is a need to explore and develop new antifungal reagents
of higher activity or having minimum adverse effects
(Schmourlo et al., 2005; Silver and Bostain, 1993).
Folk medicines have played important role in the treatment of
many diseases for quite a long time. In the present work an
effective folk medicine used for the treatment of scabies andringworm has been investigated. This medicine is used in
various parts of NWFP, Pakistan for treatment of these
diseases for long. Traditionally, when a sheet of paper rolledinto the form of a pipe, with its upper end closed is burnt, a
small quantity of liquid product is obtained at the lower end
of the pipe. This liquid of reddish colour, obtained from thecombustion of  paper, is known as paper oil.
The author has observed that very chronic cases of these
diseases were cured through use of the said oil, twice a day in
very small doses for three to seven days. In the present paper,investigations carried out on the composition of the product,
its antimicrobial activity as well as measures to improve the
yield, have been reported.

Abstract.  The composition of the product formed by burning of paper under controlled conditions in an indigenously
prepared reactor was determined by GC/MS, while its antifungal activity was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively bycomparison with the standard and determination of the MIC. The product was found to be effective against six fungalstrains. Amount of the product has been improved upto 25%.

100 mm. Sintered glass disc bed reactor of quick fit type was
used. The reaction was carried out by igniting 100 g of fine
paper cut into small pieces. The assembly for reaction includes,the pyrex reactor, Buckner type funnel fitted in the suction
flask, which was connected with a series of three receiving
flasks and the aspirator. The product was sucked into thesuction flask followed by its condensation into a reddish
colour liquid product with the maximum yield of 25%.
GC/MS analysis.  General profile for the liquid product of
the oxidative cracking of paper was obtained using EI-MS.
Analysis of the liquid product was conducted on a massspectrometer JMS 600 H Jeol and the product was separated
into its components using Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph
equipped with a fused capillary column (HP.5 l.; 30 m x 0.32 mmi.d., film thickness, 0.25 μm) with polydimethylsiloxane as the
stationary phase. The carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of
1.8 ml/min.
Injection mode was split at a split ratio of 35. The column was
initially kept at 50 °C for 5 min and then the temperature was
raised to 240 °C at the rate of 5 °C/min. The injector tempera-
ture was 250
 °C and the amount of sample was 1 μl.
Identification of major components of the product was
confirmed using total ion chromatogram analysis (TIC) as
well as fragmentation pattern and library matching by NIST
Mass Spectral Library, while the quantification was carriedout using the peak area.
Antifungal activity.  Antifungal activity of the sample was
determined using agar tube dilution method. The activity of
the sample was investigated against Trychophyton longifusus ,
264Biological SciencesCandida albicans , Candida glabarata , Fusarium solan i,
Aspergillus flavus  and Microsporum canis . Sabourad dex-
trose agar (SDA) was used for the growth of fungi; 0.4 ml of
SDA, for each fungus species, was taken in six separate tubesand autoclaved. 24 mg of the sample was dissolved in 1 mldimethylsulphoxide and 66.6 μl of this solution was dispensed
in each of the six tubes. The tubes were placed in slantingposition. These were allowed to solidify for 24 h. Each of the
tube was inoculated with 4 mm of fungal stock and incubated
at 27 °C for 7 days. The media containing only DMSO wasused as blank and Micanozole, as reference, for the samples.The reference for Aspergillus flavus  was Ampotericin B. All
the tests were carried out in triplicate.
Results and Discussion
The liquid obtained by the oxidative cracking of paper was
analyzed for composition using GC/MS. It was composed of
acids, aldehydes, ketones and furans. The compounds present
in the liquid sample are mentioned in Table 1.
The product also contained large amount of water and other
undetectable compounds. The activity of the product was
significant for all the tested fungal strains in terms of percentinhibition (Table 2).
Based on the presence of oxygenated compounds, it can be
inferred that the sample inhibits the growth of fungi throughinhibiting the growth of mycelia, interference with the SHTable 2.  Antifungal activity of the product of oxidative

activity of the oxygenated compounds has been reported by
various workers (Turchetti et al.,  2005; Karmen et al.,  2003;
Stange et al.,  1999). The sample contains aldehydes, which
are cell wall rupturing compounds (Knobloch et al., 1989). It
also contains phenolic compounds, which are antioxidant, and
interfere with enzymes (Karmen et al.,  2003). Presence of acid
in the sample supports its antifungal activity as reported by
Turchetti et al. (2005). Antifungal activity of the sample also
gets support from the work of Pour et al.  (2000) who reported
derivatives of furan. However, the activity of our sample is the
result of combined action of these compounds and is greater
than simple addition.
Conclusion
Based on the traditional knowledge, through oxidative crack-
ing of paper, significant yield of a product was obtained using
suction reactor. The product contained furans, furanones,carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones and phenols along with
water. These compounds are reportedly antimicrobial, acting
through enzyme inhibition, antioxidant, membrnane ruptureand mycelial growth inhibition. The product displayed anti-
fungal activity against six fungal species. This study helps to
formulate a broad spectrum antifungal agent.

Introduction
In rural areas, of Bangladesh, poultry are commonly reared in
semi-scavenging system. This backyard poultry is generallyinfested with various type of ectoparasites including differentspecies of lice, mites etc. having various adverse effectsspecially on body weight gain and egg production (Islam et
al.,1999; DeVaney, 1979; 1976) and acting as vectors of many
microbial pathogens including Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae
and Borrelia anserina  (Chirico et al.,  2003; Urquhart et al. ,
1996; Kettle, 1995).
Ectoparasitic infestation of poultry is the most common
problem worldwide and utmost attempts have been made
to control them by using several chemical compounds.
Although some of the chemicals are efficient enough to kill
ectoparasites but most of them are unsuitable in terms offood safety and environmental problems as they have
residual and cumulative effects (Lee et al.,  2002). Moreover,
some of them are toxic to mammals including humans.
These are also not readily available especially in rural
areas.  Besides, resistance frequently develops in ectopara-sites against chemical insecticides (Szczypel et al., 2003).
Various species of plants and herbs of medicinal value areavailable in Bangladesh which are commonly used by thevillage people to treat many diseases. These herbal prod-
ucts are usually safe, easily available, cost effective and
environment friendly. Nahar et al.  (2005) found acaricidal
efficacy of ata, durba, neem, bishkatali and sharifa. Acari-cidal and insecticidal activities have been widely evaluatedin different countries of the world, such as in India (Rahmanet al., 2005), South Korea (Kim et al. , 2004), Pakistan
(Khan et al. , 2003) etc. The present research work was
undertaken to determine the efficacy of three differentplants viz. Nicotiana tabacum  (tobacco),  Azadirachta indica
(neem) and Polygonum hydropiper  (bishkatali) against ecto-
parasites of poultry so as to develop an unconventionalcontrol method which would be easy to use, cost effectiveand applicable everywhere.
Materials and Methods
Dust prepared from leaves and/or stems of tobacco, neem and
bishkatali were applied in backyard poultry, naturally infestedwith lice, mites and flies, during July 2005 to May 2006 inPatuakhali district in Bangladesh, covered by the smallholderlivestock development project- 2 (SLDP-2). Identification ofthe parasites, preparation of plant products and other
relevant work were done in the Department of Parasitology,
Faculty of Veterinary Science (FVS), Bangladesh AgriculturalUniversity (BAU), Mymensingh.
Three common plants namely neem ( Azadirachta indica )
bishkatali ( Polygonum hydropiper ) and tobacco ( Nicotiana
tabacum ) were selected based on their ethno-veterinary use
among the rural people of Bangladesh. Neem and bishkatali
were collected from the surrounding area of BAU campus,and tobacco leaves were collected from the local markets. Forneem and tobacco only leaves were used, whereas forbishkatali both the stems and leaves were used.
After collection, plants were brought to the laboratory. All the
fresh leaves and stems were washed in running tap water
and cut into small pieces. The plant materials were dried inPak. J. Sci. Ind. Res. 2008 51(5) 267-271
267sunlight, and then in the oven at 55-60 °C to constant weight.
Dusts of different plants were prepared primarily by manualcrushing of dried leaves and then by pulverizing the crushed
leaves and stems with the help of pulverizer and preserved in
airtight plastic contaners, till their use.
For the study of ectoparasiticidal efficacy, birds were
selected from the farmers households in the research areawhich were regularly vaccinated and dewormed. Thirty fami-lies were selected from the said areas, each having at least
five birds and all infested with ectoparasites. These families
were divided into ten groups containing three families ineach. In all the families, almost similar type of managementpractices such as housing, feeding, cleaning of shed etc. wereconfirmed by regular monitoring. Birds were identified byleg bands.
Pretreatment observations. One square inch of the body
surface area of poultry in which the ectoparasites weredensely populated were selected and counted. Body weightof each bird was taken by digital balance and recorded beforetreatment.
Treatment. Treated groups were marked as GT5, GT10, GT15,
GN5, GN10, GN15, GB5, GB10 and GB15. Powdered form
of tobacco leaves were given admixture with ashes as litter at
5%, 10% and 15% concentration in GT5, GT10 and GT15groups, respectively. Another three groups viz. GN5, GN10 andGN15 were treated with neem leaves at 5%, 10% and 15%concentration, respectively. Last groups, GB5, GB10 and GB15were treated with bishkatali leaves in the same concentrtions.
Bedding with only ash (500 g for each poultry shed) was given
to the control group. The treatment was given 5 times, at 4 daysintervals, to each group (21 days).
Posttreatment observations. Regular monitoring of each
poultry house, with counting and recording of ectoparasiteswas carried out at 4 days intervals in the selected birds todetect the efficacy of the sample substances, up to the end of
the experiment. Efficacy was determined in terms of reduc-
tion of load of ectoparasites. At the end of the experiment,body weight of each bird was taken and recorded.
Statistical analysis. Odds ratio with its confidence interval
was computed for comparing different concentrations(Schlesselman, 1982). Repeated analysis of variance wasperformed for testing the effectiveness of tobacco, neem and
bishkatali using the software Systat 6.0 for Windows
 (SPSS,
1996). Analysis of Covariance (ANCOV A) was conducted tocompute the mean body weight gain per bird as there existeda heterogeneity in age and sex of the experimental birds(Gomez and Gomez, 1984). The benefit cost ratio (BCR), asimple calculation that depicts the total financial return foreach taka (Tk, local currency) invested in the programme was
computed by the following formula:
Results and Discussion
In the present study, birds were found to be infested with the
following lice species:  Menacanthus stramineus  (74%),
Menopon gallinae  (63%), Lipeurus caponis  (48%),
Cuclotogaster heterographus  (25%) , Goniodes gigas  (18%)
and Goniocotes gallinae  (14%), one species of fly, namely
Simulium  sp. (3.7%), and two species of mites namely
Dermanyssus gallinae  (57%) and Knemidocoptes mutans
(43%). The study revealed that regular use of tobacco, neem
and bishkatali plant’s pulv gradually reduced the meanectoparasitic load in backyard poultry (Table 1).  The highest
ectoparasiticidal efficacy was exerted by tobacco at 15% con-centration (96.91%) followed by neem at the same concentra-tion (77.52%) and tobacco at 10% concentration (76.92%).
Odds ratio of the plants at different concentrations showing
highest efficacy was also calculated. Tobacco at 15% concen-tration was 9.09 and 9.40 times more effective against ecto-parasites than neem at 15% concentration and tobacco at 10%concentration, respectively. On the other hand, odds ratiobetween neem at 15% concentration and tobacco at 10% was
1.03, which indicated that they were almost equally effective
for removing ectoparasites (Table 2).  Tobacco at 15%
concentration drastically reduced the parasitic burden in GT15group. The changes in the number of ectoparasites weresignificant up to 3
rd observation in that group but tobacco at
10% concentration rapidly reduced ectoparasites on the
1st treatment, then it acted slowly up to the 5th observation. On
the other hand, neem at 15% concentration reduced ectopara-sitic load slowly throughout the five observations (Table 1).Efficacy of tobacco was studied by other workers againstdifferent types of ectoparasites. Vasanthi et al.  (2004) treated
Sarcoptes scabiei -infested rabbit with tobacco  decoction and
found that it was highly effective with no side effect and
re-infestation was not observed even after one and a half monthof the treatment. Burkhart and Burkhart (2000) reported thatnicotine (active ingredient in tobacco) facilitated removal ofadult lice by inducing muscle twitching that may affect theinsects’ normal grip on hair follicles. Potenza et al.  (1999)
reported more than 80% efficacy of aqueous extract of
tobacco against spider mite. Though there are some varia-tions between the present and previous results, it can undoubt-edly be concluded that these plant products are effective inremoving ectoparasites. However, there can be differences in              total benefit

and the type of parasites.
In tobacco, active ingredient is alkaloid which is known as
nicotine (Burrows and Tyrl, 2001). Nicotine is a contactpoison which is highly toxic and is absorbed through spiracles
and integument of ectoparasites. It acts directly on the
ganglia of the insects’ central nervous system and producesexcitation at low concentration but paralysis at high concen-tration due to a direct action on the synopses (Gillott, 1995).Perhaps, in this manner, they cause paralysis of ectoparasitesrapidly. Besides, nicotine sulphate has a fumigant action
against Dermanyssus gallinae when it is painted on the perches(Soulsby, 1982). Lapage (1962) reported killing of lice with-
out disturbing poultry by painting the perches with strongtobacco extract containing 40% nicotine and keeping the birdsin that house for two nights; the warmth of the birdbodies causes the nicotine to evaporate and kill the lice and
eggs. He also suggested repeating the treatment after 10 days.
In this experiment, tobacco leaves were applied as pulv mixedwith ashes as bedding. So, pulv of tobacco leaves came incontact with ectoparasites throughout the night. Furthermore,the said evaporating effect might be also exerted on the ecto-parasites. No toxic effect was observed in poultry with
tobacco dose used in the study.
Neem at 15% concentration was also effective (77.52%), but
it took a little longer time for exerting its effect on theparasites. Efficacy of bishkatali was insignificant in allthe three concentrations applied. Pathak et al. (2004)  recorded
that methanol extract of neem was highly effective against
tick. Kumar et al.  (2002) found that neem leaves caused 80%
mortality to adult lice. Nahar et al.  (2005) carried out an in
vitro trial with neem, bishkatali, durba, ata and sharifa against
cattle tick Boophilus microplus  and observed 100% efficacy
of ethanol extract of bishkatali at 2% concentration. But theefficacy of neem was 86.67% when applied as aqueous
extract. Probably active ingredients of neem plants, having
ectoparasiticidal efficacy, are water soluble. It could be saidthat contents of neem leaves have some ectoparasitcidaleffect in dry preparations but required high concentration.On the other hand, the ingredients present in bishkatali maynot be effective against ectoparasites prevalent in poultry or
those ingredients are not active in dry preparation. Pulv is a
crude product which possibly contains active ingredients inTable 1.  Effectiveness of tobacco, neem and bishkatali in terms of reduction of mean ectoparasitic load per bird in each square

In study of the effect of ectoparasites in terms of body weight
gain, among the treated groups, the highest mean body weight
(232.3 g) had been achieved by poultry in GT15 group (treatedwith 15%) followed by that in GT10 (178.26 g) and GN15(159.76 g) groups that were treated by 10% tobacco and 15%neem leaves, respectively (Table 3).these may not be equally suitable since farmers need some
extra care in applying these chemical insecticides. Besides,tobacco is available in local markets of rural areas all the year
round and requires less care and attention. Moreover the
effective doses (15% and 10%) are not toxic for the poultry.On the contrary, chemical agents are toxic to the poultry andare not environmentally friendly. In the present experiment,the benefit cost ratio (BCR) per bird was found to be Tk.7.5
(Takka or Tk is local currency of Bangladesh) depicts the
investment of Tk. 1 would make return of Tk. 7.5 (taking Tk
130/kg poultry meat and Tk. 50/kg tobacco, mean body weightgain in best treatment group was 232.30 g). Therefore, use oftobacco is recommended at 15% concentration, mixed withashes as  bedding, for 12 days for the control of ectoparasiticinfestation in  backyard poultry.

It is evident that the birds of each treatment group (except
GB15 and GB10) had the advantage of gaining body weight
due to the removal of ectoparasites. This finding directlyconforms with the result of Devaney (1979) who evaluatedthe effect of Ornythonyssus sylviarum  (northern fowl mite)
on poultry. He observed that the mean body weight of WhiteLeghorn roosters was approximately 100 g less than that of
the uninfested roosters. Devaney (1976) also studied such an
effect on lice,  (Menacanthus stramineus ) in White Leghorn
hens and found that average body weight of hens decreased(85, 300, and 450 grams in 23, 35, and 49 weeks old birds)in comparison with the uninfested control group. Due totreatment, parasitic load of birds gradually decreased, and
simultaneously restlessness was also reduced. So, their feed
consumption and utilization increased resulting in improve-ment of health.Tobacco is cost effective in the treatment of ectoparasites inbackyard poultry. Although, some chemical agents (malathion,dichlorvos, permethrin, pyrethrin etc.) are effective in very
low concentration and very small amount of insecticide is
required but these may be suitable in the treatment of largepoultry farm birds. In small farms or in backyard poultry farms,270

In developing countries drinking water and sanitation related
diseases are the major contributors of the disease burden(Pruss et al., 2002). The potential of drinking water to trans-
port microbial pathogens to consumers causing subsequent
illness is well documented in the countries throughout theworld. One third of intestinal infections worldwide are caused
by water-borne pathogens (Mead et al., 1999; Hunter, 1997).
In France, most of the gastrointestinal illnesses are associatedwith the consumption of contaminated tap water (Collin et al.,
1981). Several water-borne pathogens cause diseases of high
mortality rate. Due to these reasons, faecal bacteria are selec-ted as indicators of faecal pollution of drinking water (WHO,
2004).
Enumeration of the total coliform bacterial population as
indicator of water quality has been in use for some 60 years
(Geldreich, 1966). All the standards for drinking water quality
do not allow presence of faecal indicators in drinking water(WHO, 1993). The cases of outbreaks of gastroenteritis in 2000
in Ontario, Canada involved E. coli  0157:H7 (BGOSHU, 2000).
Mainly faecally derived coliforms, thermotolerant coliformsand E.coli  are taken as indicators of faecal contamination and
this criterion has led to significant improvement in drinking
water quality worldwide (WHO, 2006).
The demand of water for more than 16 million population of
Karachi city, the industrial hub of Pakistan, (Rahman et al.,
1997) is presently 601 million gallons per day, whereas studieshave shown that due to various reasons bulk supply to the
town by the municipal authorities is 293 mgd; thus there is a
shortfall of between 260 and 308 mgd potable water for thecitizens (Rahman, 2007). Water supply system of Karachi cityPak. J. Sci. Ind. Res. 2008 51(5) 272-275

Abstract.  In the analysis of 329 treated (tap) water samples and 30 well water samples of Karachi city, 94 (28.5%) tap
water samples were found contaminated with faecal coliforms and had high heterotrophic plate count (HPC), 153 (46.5%)had very high heterotrophic plate count and only 82 samples were fit for human consumption. Out of 30 well watersamples only 2 samples were fit for human consumption; 23 (76%) had high faecal coliform count and HPC, whereas,5 (16.67%) were rejected owing to extremely high bacterial count.

*Author for correspondence; E-mail: shagufta.a.shaikh@gmail.comis 40 years old resulting in corroded and leaking pipes,
whereas, wastewater treatment is almost non-existent in the
city (Bridges, 2007). Due to shortage of water the supply is
mostly intermittent in urban areas. Creation of vacuum in thewater supply pipes due to intermittent water supply togetherwith leaky pipes, lead to infiltration of sewage and industrialwaste, into drinking water supply system and the drinkingwater become polluted (Mughal, 2008). The situation is
further aggravated during rains and frequent epidemics of
gastrointestinal diseases in the city are blamed on to con-sumption of polluted water. Estimates indicated that annuallymore then three million Pakistanis become infected withwater borne diseases (UNDP-WSP, 2005). The water mainlycontains E.coli , which is a faecal contaminant, besides the
industrial, agrochemical and even radiological population.
In view of this situation of potable water of the Karachi city,
microbiological analysis of the samples of consumable water
from different localities is important for keeping a vigil on the
possible contamination of water, whether at the water treat-
ment plants of the city or elsewhere for taking timely action.
Keeping this factor in mind, the present study was undertaken
in which a survey of water samples from different sources and
localities of Karachi were analyzed to determine the quality of
water and present some solutions.
Materials and Methods
In the survey of water, a total of 359 samples of water were
randomly collected from different localities of Karachi which
included 329 samples of treated (tap) water supplied by mu-nicipal authorities and 30 well water samples which were col-lected from the open wells, usually used by the consumerswithin the housing localities for drinking purpose.
272Bacteriological analysis of water samples. Standard plate
count . One ml and 0.1 ml of water was assayed, using pour
plate procedure with standard agar medium (PCA; Merck) for
heterotrophic plate count. A direct colony count was performedafter the plate had been incubated for 48 h at 37 °C.
Total coliform count . Water sample (100 ml) was passed
through a 0.45 μm cellulose ester nitrate membrane filter and
carefully transferred to the surface of lactose triphenyl
tetrazolium chloride (LTTC) agar plate and incubated at 36 °Cfor 24 h.
Orange to yellow colonies with yellow hallow on the back of
the plate were counted as thermotolerant coliforms andfaecal coliforms which were further streaked on PCA plates.The isolated colonies were examined for oxidase activity.
Thermotolerant coliform count . The same medium used to
enumerate total coliforms was used, for the growth ofthermotolerant coliforms except that incubation was carried
out at 44 °C; after 24 h of incubation, characteristic colonies
were counted and inoculated in E.C. medium for thermo-tolerant coliforms.
WHO standard for drinking water was used for the absence or
presence of total coliforms, thermotolerant faecal coliformsand for heterotrophic plate count.
Results and Discussion
The results of the microbiological analysis of 329 treated
water and 30 well water samples are given in Fig. 1.
Treated water samples.  Out of 329 tap water samples, 94
(28.57%) indicated presence of faecal contaminants and high
heterotrophic plate count; 153 (46.5%) had very high HPC
and only 82 samples (24.92%) had low HPC with no faecalcoliform or their number was within the permissible limit(Fig. 1) as per WHO Guidelines (1993).
Heterotrophic plate count (HPC) is important in assessing
the efficiency of water treatment process and also helps inestimation of general hygienic quality of the water (WHO,2003).
All the organisms that grow best at 37 °C are usually less
frequently present in water and their presence in water
system indicates their possible access from external source
and is a sign of severe pollution (WHO, 2003; Report, 1982).In general, water utilities can achieve heterotrophic bacterialconcentration of 10 colony forming units (CFU) per millilitreor less in finished water (Fox and Reasoner, 1999). Heavyfluctuations in HPC in the treated water samples indicatesevere ingress of faecal pollution in the treatment process
(WHO, 2003).
Several species of pathogenic bacteria form part of HPC such
as Flavobacterium , Pseudomonas , Citrobacter , Staphylococ-
cus, Aeromonas , Alcaligenes , Acinetobacter , Klebsiella ,
Chromobacterium , and many others in addition to a range of
unidentifiable microorganisms (Bitton, 1994). HPC tests
recover a broad range of bacterial species, some of whichmay be opportunistic bacterial pathogens.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa  is most frequently associated
with many pathologies, such as urinary tract infections,respiratory diseases, ear and eye infections as well as a range
of systemic diseases, such as bacterimia, osteomylites and
meningitis (Pollack, 2000).
Aeromonas hydrophila , an additional heterotrophic bacterium
that is capable of growing in a distribution system, has been
placed on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Con-taminant Candidate List. Microorganisms listed on the Con-
taminant Candidate List are those that are potential health273

(a)           (b)          (c)risks through drinking water and need to be evaluated for
possible regulation (US EPA, 2005).
In the present study, 46% samples of treated water had high
HPC indicating inadequate treatment of water at the treatmentplants. It is therefore, important that such sources of contami-
nation should be located and proper precautionary measures
should be taken to avoid such heavy contamination of thedrinking water supply.
The drinking water should be suitably treated to follow the
accepted standards. Essential health standards do not allowE. coli  or thermotolerant coliform bacteria to be detectable in
100 ml sample of drinking water (Adams et al., 2008). The
presence of faecal pollutants in water indicates its inadequatetreatment requiring immediate action (Dufour et al., 2005).
Microbial and other indicator analysis will be a major source
of evidence for qualitative risk assessment. Enumeration ofseveral specific pathogens such as detection of E. coIi , total
coliforms in either source water or treated water indicates that
the water is subject to contamination from human or animalfaeces.
In the present study, analysis of treated (tap) water of Karachi
city indicates the drinking water to be highly polluted. Thepresence of faecal coliforms in drinking water may be due to
insufficien treatment of water at the plants or their ingress in
the supply lines due to out-lived pipe system as indicated bythe UNDP-WSP (2005). In any case the situation requires
immediate investigation and corrective action.
A regular survey for the source of contamination and relevant
monitoring programme should not only cover regular sampling
but also be designed to examine high risk factors such as
rainfall or the presence of vulnerable sites within the groundwater abstracting system. As it is reported non-microbial
parameters can also be used for ground water contamination
monitoring and give information about the possible potentialrisk (Beaudeau, 2002; Dangendorf et al., 2002).
Well water samples.  In the present study, well water  samples
were collected from different localities of the city, where people
are using drinking water of wells due to nonavailability orinsufficient supply of treated water. From the presented data
in Fig. 1(B), it can be observed that among 30 well water
samples only 2 (6.67%) were found fit for human consumptionwhile 23 samples (76.67%) were rejected due to very high
faecal pollution and high HPC. Five samples (16.67%) were
rejected due to the high HPC only but in which faecal coliformswere not present.
There can be several reasons for groundwater contamination.
In USA the most frequent reported source of ground watercontamination in 1984, was the septic tank system which had
high volume of untreated waste water, discharged into ground
water (Hagedorn, 1984). Another active source of ground
water contamination is the use of wastewater for crop irriga-tion. The potential risk of contamination of water source
from sewage sludge disposal is well recognized (Mara and
Cairncross, 1989). According to Rolland et al. (1983), the main
source of ground water pollution are manures which mixed
with surface water percolate to the ground water. These all
may be the possible reasons for faecal contamination ofground water. Rejection of 76.6% samples of water due to
high contamination with total coliforms and thermotolerant
coliforms (faecal coliforms) and elevated HPC indicates thepossible leakage of sewage in ground water.
The data of well water samples with such a heavy faecal
contamination of ground water when correlated with thebacteriological analysis of treated water reflects the inade-
quate treatment given to the sourced water and also possible
ingress of contaminated water into the drinking water at thesite of treatment plant or into the supply system due to faulty
lines. Such heavy contamination of drinking water poses
severe health hazards due to consumption of highly pollutedwater especially by immunocompromised population (Aziz,
2005).
Mismanagement of water is also an important issue. It has
been reported that in the third world countries, farmers are
using more then required water for irrigation purpose result-
ing in loss of thousands of gallons of water in the irrigationprocess, further endangering the situation (PARC, 1982). It is
further reported that there is an annual loss of 35 MAF in
ground water seepage leading to the rise of under-groundwater table and its mixing with the surface water and untreated
water due to which several water related diseases have
become very prevalent in the Sindh province of Pakistan.The meager health sector spending by the government is
worsening the state of affairs which is bound to create havoc
in terms of public health and safety.
Conclusion
On the basis of the data of bacteriological analysis of thetreated water and well water samples of Karachi city, it can beconcluded that the situation is alarming requiring immediate
attention and investigation, pinpointing the causes and
providing the solution. Adequate treatment should be givento drinking water in treatment plants; contamination of water
during the treatment process should be checked and ingress
of pollution in the system should be closely monitored andcurative measures be introduced. Moreover, policies may be
devised for proper management of water.274

Introduction
The basis of decline in plant growth under saline conditions is
poorly understood. It has been suggested that decrease in
growth with salinity may be due to increased respiration rate
resulting from higher energy requirement (Orcutt and Nilsen2000; Schwarz and Gale, 1981; Gale, 1975) and reduction ofquantum yield of photosynthesis (Seemann and Critchley1985; Yeo, 1983). Some persons have attributed the depres-sion in growth rate to the combined effects of salinity on
photosynthesis and the pattern of carbon allocation (Masojidek
and Hall, 1992; Brugnoli and Lauteri, 1991). Another possi-bility is that increased salinity reduces the photosyntheticsurface area available for CO
2 assimilation, i.e., the salinity
may reduce the expansion of the leaf surface (Orcutt andNilsen, 2000). There is increasing evidence that salinity
changes photosynthetic parameters, including osmotic and leaf
water potential, transpiration rate and leaf temperature(Faruqui, 2002; Kabir,  2002; Islam, 2001; Sultana et al.,
1999). In the present study, we compare the effect of NaClsalinity on the components of carbon accumulation in twomungbean genotypes, BM01 and BM21, which differ in their
salinity tolerance: dark respiration, quantum yield, transpira-
tion rate and the extension growth of individual leaves.
Materials and Methods
Mungbean seeds of two genotypes, BM01 (tolerant) and BM21(susceptible), were sown in earthen pots in the vinylhouse atthe Environmental Stress Research Site of the BangabandhuSheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University, Gazipur. Each
pot was filled with 12 kg air-dried soil. Compost (1/4
th of the
soil volume) and 0.27, 0.28, 0.20 g urea, TSP and MP, respec-tively, per pot were uniformly incorporated into the soil.Thepots were irrigated with tap water until the seedlings were wellestablished. Afterwards tap water in control group and 12.5 mM
NaCl solution in salt-treated groups were applied up to three
days and 25 mM for the next three days for hardening of seed-lings before applying actual treatments. When the trifoliateappeared i.e., ten days after emergence (DAE), the requiredamount of respective salt solutions (50 and 100 mM) per treat-ments were applied to 25 pots till harvest.
Dark respiration (0 μmol /m
2/s) was measured using a portable
photosynthesis system (LICOR-6200) assembled with anInfrared Gas Analyzer (IRGA) and data logger following theprocedure described by Kubota and Hamid (1992) and the leaf
chamber was covered with black cloth. The quantum yield for
net CO
2 exchange was derermined at intercellular CO2 concen-
tration which were saturating for photosynthesis and over aphoton flux density (PFD) range of 0 and 50 μ mol/m
2/s (photo-
synthetically active radiation). Each measurement was replicated
3 times. The light source was artificial halogen lamp (OSRAM,HQI-TS 150/NDL). Leaf area was measured with a leaf areameter (Model AAM-7, Hayashi Dehnco Co Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
Specific leaf area (SLA) for individual leaf was calculated as the
dry weight per unit leaf area (Leidi and Saiz, 1997).
Results and Discussion
Leaf growth. Salinity reduced the growth of leaves in both
the genotypes (Fig.1) and the reduction was more in BM21 asPak. J. Sci. Ind. Res. 2008 51(5) 276-280
Abstract.  The mechanism of salt tolerance in relation to individual leaf growth, transpiration, dark respiration rate,
and quantum yield was studied at 0, 50 and 100 mM NaCl solution. At high salt concentration the leaves of BM21showed higher reduction in growth than those of BM 01. The relative reduction (% of control) of Tr and Dr were lessin BM01 than in BM21. The dark respiration rates were less than 1 μmol (CO
2)/m2/s and accounted for 19 and 32%
increase (% of control) at the highest PFD in BM01, while it was 31 and 44% in BM21, respectively at 50 and 100 mMNaCl. More reduced quantum yield in BM21 than BM01 reflects more maintenance costs of energy in repairinginjured tissue, enzyme reactions and ion movement.

276compared to BM01. However, the genotypes exhibited strik-
ing difference in leaf appearance in response to the salt stress.Leaf appearance rate of BM01was insensitive to salt stress,
while the appearance rate of BM21 decreased due to salinity.
Genotype BM21 failed to produce 8
th leaf under saline condi-
tion. Green leaf area followed the same trend as leaf fresh anddry weight (Fig. 1). Leaf area per plant was higher in BM21than in BM01 at all the treatments but the reduction due tosalinity was higher in BM21 than that in BM01. Green leaf
area per plant was reduced by 43% and 56% over the controlin BM01 and BM21, at 100 mM NaCl, respectively. It indi-
cated that leaves of BM21 were more sensitive to salinity thanthose of BM01. BM01 had a higher SLA than genotype BM21
except under control conditions (Fig. 1). The reduction of SLA
at 50 mM was 8 and 34% in BM01 and BM21, while it was24 and 40% at 100 mM NaCl, respectively. Leaf expansionwas inhibited less in BM01 as shown by higher SLA, leafarea and total leaf number at harvest. Beadle (1993) and Leidiand Saiz (1997) found higher relative growth rate in geno-
types with leaves of higher SLA (less carbon invested per unit

BM21 under salt stress, as plants of this genotype showedexpanding L6, L7 and L8. Genotype BM21 showed a delay in
the generation of new leaves with only half of the plants reach-
ing the 7
th leaf stage. Sharma (1998) concluded from his study
that salinity led to increased leaf diffusive resistance and
consequently a decrease in transpiration and increase in leaftemperature. The shift in temperature may play a vital role for
tissue desiccation. In  addition, increased ionic concentrations
in the leaves further aggravated the leaf growth along with
tissue dehydration (Leidi and Saiz, 1997; Mangal and Lal,
1988).
Transpiration rate and diffusive resistance. In general, the
transpiration rate (Tr) decreased and diffusive resistance (Dr) ofboth the genotypes increased with increasing levels of salinity(Fig. 2). A weak negative linear relationship (y = -0.2627x +
3.2283, R
2 = 0.4112) was observed between Tr and Dr. The
genotype BM01 showed higher Tr rate and lower Dr than thatof BM21 under salt stress condition. The relative reduction(% of control) of Tr and Dr was less in BM01 than that in BM21.
Higher transpiration rate of BM01 than that of BM21 indicatesthat BM01 plants maintained a better water relation than BM21under salt stress conditions (Orcutt and Nilsen, 2000;
Hagemeyer, 1997;). Subbarao et al.  (1990) observed higher Tr
rate in tolerant pigeonpea genotype than salt sensitive one. He
reported that the tolerant genotype was able to maintain hightranspiration rates, possibly because of the high ability of root
system to uptake soil moisture to meet the demands of water
required for transpiration under salinity stress. Reduced tran-spiration rates under salt stress were also observed (Flowers
and Yeo, 1995; Munns, 1993; Waisel, 1991).

0 mM 50 mM 100 mM BM01 BM21Dark respiration rate. The dark respiration rate measured at
0 PFD increased with increasing salinity levels in both thegenotypes (Table 1). This increased respiration is generally
refered to as salt respiration (Islam, 2001; Datta and Sharma,
1990; Schwarz and Gale, 1981). The respiratory energy maybe consumed in repairing the injured tissues and in conduct-ing the active transport processes. Therefore, it has beenproposed (Ahmed et al.,  1989) that growth inhibition under
saline conditions as compared with non-saline condition is
partly due to shortage of energy since a considerable amount
of energy is consumed in osmotic adjustments. BM21 showedhigher relative respiration than BM01. The dark respirationrate was less than 1 μmol (CO
2)/m2/s and accounted for 19
and 32% increase (% of control)  in BM01, while it was 31and 44% in BM21 at 50 and 100 mM NaCl, respectively.
Higher relative respiration in BM21 under salt stress indi-
cates more consumption of respiratory energy in repairingthe injured tissues and in conducting the active transportprocesses. Earlier reports indicated that salinity has littleeffect on dark respiration of salt tolerant plant (Ahmed et al.,
1989; Schwarz and Gale, 1981).
Quantum yield. Quantum yield was estimated from the slope
of the PFD response curves in the linear regression between0 and 50 μmol/m
2/s PFD. A reduction in photosynthetic
efficiency with salt stress was observed in the quantum yieldfor CO
2 fixation ( μmol CO2 fixed/mol absorbed quanta, pho-
tosynthetically active radiation) for BM01 and BM21
(Table 1). The quantum yield of leaves from BM01 grown at
100 mM NaCl was approximately 50% below that of controlplants, while it was 74% in BM21. Determination of quantumyields at high CO
2 concentration precluded interference from
stomatal closure resulting from salinity stress (Seemann andCritchley, 1985; Yeo, 1983). The reduction in quantum yield
of photosynthesis with salt stress may constitute at least apartial basis for the reduction in the rate of photosynthesis
over the CO
2 saturtion portion of the Pn curve. Salt might have
a direct effect upon processes involved in light harvesting,
electron transport and/or photophosphorylation resulting in
decrease in the quantum efficiency of photosynthesis (Seemannand Critchley, 1985). Another possibility is that the reducedquantum yield reflects energy utilization associated with ionmovement. Energy costs of ion movement have been estimatedby Yeo (1983), and in some cases it is calculated that ion trans-
port in glycophyte, is in fact, more costly than that in halo-
phyte  (Gale et al.,  1967). Therefore, more reduced quantum
yield in BM21 than BM01 reflects more maintenance costs ofenergy in repairing injured tissue, enzyme reactions and ionmovement (Cheeseman, 1988).

Md. Abdul Aziz et al.Introduction
Environmental contamination is recognized as a worldwide
problem. Part of this problem is caused by the application of
pesticides that are being used in agriculture, public health,
forestry and animal husbandry. Pesticides are important inmodern farming and remain inevitable for the foreseeable
future in order to feed such a large world population applying
safe agricultural practices throughout the food chain(Dankwardt, 1999; FAO/IAEA Training and Reference
Centre). However, food quality is of equal importance to food
quantity. Inherently, pesticides show a certain degree oftoxicity and especially the less degradable, more persistent
compounds such as organochlorine pesticides pose hazar-
dous problems in the environment (Meastroni et al., 2001;
1998; Hock et al., 1994; Hussain et al., 1994a, b, c, 1995; Dreher
and Podratzki, 1988; Fenske and Sternback, 1987; Louis and
Kisselbach, 1987; Brook, 1974). Over the past few years, therehas been an increasing concern about their pollution potential
because of their effects on non-target organisms (Moore and
Waring, 2001; Dankwardt et al., 1998a; Taguchi and Yakushiji,
1988). This concern is expressed in established regulations,
norms, standards, monitoring programmes, acts, etc. (EPA,
USA, 2008; GEMS/Food, 1997). The concern seems valid sincethe huge amount of data, generated over the recent years,Pak. J. Sci. Ind. Res. 2008 51(5) 281-292

Abstract.  An overview on the use of immunochemical technology for pesticide residue analysis has been described.
Pioneering work on the development of pesticide immunoassays (IA) using ELISA technique in Pakistan has been carriedout and described in detail. Dieldrin, atrazine and DDT IAs were performed using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay(ELISA) kits to determine residual levels of these pesticides in soil and water. ELISA was found to be successful fordieldrin, atrazine and DDT residue analysis. A highly sensitive in-house ELISA has now been developed for atrazineresidues determination. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits by immunization with an atrazine-BSA conjugate andoptimized with atrazine-peroxidase (POD) conjugate. It showed middle of the test (50% B/Bo) at 90 ng/l and lowestdetection limit (LDL) at 1ng/l in water. For environmental samples, 50% B/Bo was at 75 ng/l and LDL at 4 ng/l. No cross-reactivities were shown by terbutryn, ametryn, des-isopropylatrazine, de-ethylatrazine except terbuthylazine (17%) andhydroxyatrazine (30%). Data obtained by ELISA, significantly correlated with those obtained by HPLC (r = 0.990). Itrequired no clean-up for water samples and less clean-up steps (than HPLC) in soil/coloured extracts, but showed matrixeffect. Validation showed good accuracy and precision thereby suggesting that this test can be applied accurately foratrazine detection in water. This IA experience demands future IAs development in Pakistan for commonly used pesticides.

including commodities like water, soil, plant and animal
tissues and more specifically food (EPA, USA, 2008; Ibitayoand Monosson, 2007; Frank and Wilson, 2004; Dankwardt
and Hock, 1997, 1993; Jourdan et al., 1996; Lawrence et al.,
1996; Leavitt et al., 1991; Chamberlain, 1990; Bushway et al.,
1989). Widespread occurrence of pesticides in the evironment
requires periodic monitoring during seasonal applications
(Greenfield et al., 2004; WHO, 1997). However, in Pakistan,
which is an agricultural country and a variety of pesticides are
being continuously sprayed on a variety of crops to maintain
agricultural productivity, no documentation regardingroutine environmental monitoring for pesticide residues is
made. Only pesticide dosages are standardized according to
the targeted pests attack and recommended to the end-users(Saleem and Haq, 2003).
Need to develop an ELISA technique.  Keeping in view the
persistence, toxicity and common use of pesticides, an effi-
cient methodology for their routine monitoring in water, soil,agricultural produce and other samples, indirectly related to
these commodities, is of utmost importance. Much effort is
therefore, required in the research and investigation concer-ning development of the new and improvement of the existing
methods for pesticide analysis. Conventional analytical
methods used by pesticide residue analysts worldwideinvolve multi-step sample clean-up procedures followed by
281Reviewgas chromatography (GC), gas chromatography-mass spectro-
metry (GC/MS) or high-performance liquid chromatography-
mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) (Aysal et al., 2007; Giorgi
et al., 2005; Aguera et al., 2002; Brady et al., 1995; Schews
et al ., 1993; Chamberlain, 1990; Ferris and Haigh, 1987;
Vermeulen et al., 1982). However, these methods are expen-
sive, sophisticated, time consuming, require highly purifiedgasses and relatively large volume of solvents involving
extraction of large volumes of water, expensive instrumen-
tation, extensive purification, and often derivatization isrequired. For a developing country like Pakistan, these
factors become the major problem for routine environmental
monitoring, which involves large number of samples. Thesemethods do not cope with the volume of work if strict check
on permissible maximum residual limits (MRL) in the environ-
ment is required (Dankwardt, 1999). For this purpose, a sensi-tive, rapid and most important cost-effective technology
should be explored. As a consequence, attention has been
directed to newer methods and immunoassay (IA) is likelythe best option (Kim et al., 2007; Ahn et al., 2007a, 2004;
Hennion and Barcelo, 1998; Jones et al., 1997; Knopp, 1995;
Meulenberg et al ., 1995; Aga et al ., 1994; Sherry, 1992;
Hammock et al., 1990).
Immunoassay is not a new technique. In the field of clinical
chemistry, it was developed for the measurement of insulin inblood in 1960. Since that time, it had been used for many years
in clinical chemistry as a reliable, sensitive, and selective
method to determine low concentration of organic compounds,for example, in diabetes, HIV , hepatitis, for analyzing blood,
urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and tissue extracts. Rapid
field tests are required to achieve semi quantitative or quali-tative results and ELISA offers applicability because immu-
noassay methods of analysis need equipment that are
significantly less complex and less expensive than thechromatographic methods. It is also being used for diagnosis
of different animal diseases (e.g., haemorrheagic septicemia)
and plants diseases e.g., curl viruses of cotton leaf (CLCV)and potato leaf (PLCV).
As IAs are based on the selective and sensitive antibody-
antigen (Ab-Ag) reaction, these have become a valuable toolin the field of environmental analysis; especially for screening
a large number of samples within a short time (Hall et al., 1997;
Jones et al., 1997; Kramer and Schmid, 1991; Hammock et al.,
1990, 1987; Hammock and Mumma, 1980; Kemney and
Challacombe, 1989). These assays may require less sample
clean-up steps and scale because these are specific tests.IAs are being used for determination of different environ-
mental pollutants like xenostrogens, pesticides or mercury
(Schollhorn et al., 2000; Marx et al., 1998; Marx and Hock,1998; Oosterkamp et al., 1997; Mapes et al., 1992). The possi-
bility to adapt IAs for environmental studies was recognized
more than a decade ago. Since that time, numerous assays
have been developed, of which a great deal refers to pesti-cides. IAs are becoming more acceptable monitoring tools
to monitor pesticide contamination. (Ahn et al., 2007b, 2006;
Meastroni et al., 2001, 1998; Matsui et al., 2000; Yazynina
et al., 1999; Haupt et al., 1998; Hennion and Barcelo, 1998;
Dankwardt et al., 1998a, b; Dankwardt and Hock, 1997).
Principle of ELISA methods.  Mostly, pesticide immunoassays
are based on competitive ELISA where, antibodies (Abs) are
adsorbed to a solid phase (e.g., the cavities of a microtiter
plate), in a coating step. Immobilization in this case is basedon the passive adsorption of the Abs to a plastic surface e.g.,
polystyrol. After washing in order to remove unbound
molecules, hapten (standard or sample) and enzyme tracer areadded and incubated for the immune reaction. Hapten and
enzyme tracer both compete for the available Abs-binding sites.
Therefore, the less hapten is available in the assay, the more
enzyme tracer is bound by the Abs. This competing situation
becomes apparent after the washing step that follows. After
the subsequent addition of enzyme substrate, the rate ofsubstrate conversion is determined, which is proportional to
the concentration of the bound tracer and therefore, inversely
proportional to the applied hapten concentration. Theconcentration of the hapten of unknown samples, therefore,
can be determined by means of the calibration curve (Maqbool
et al., 2008, 2002).
For pesticide immunoassays, polyclonal antibodies (pAb),
monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and recombinant antibodies
(rAb) have been used so far. Polyclonal antibodies (pAb) areobtained from the serum and comprise a mixture of different
Ab populations (Garrett et al., 1997; Kramer and Hock, 1996a,
b; Hock et al ., 1994). Monoclonal antibodies consist of a
single monospecific Ab population. These Abs are produced
in cell culture by single hybridoma cell derived from fusion
of B-lymphocytes with myeloma cells (Bryne et al., 1996;
Kohler and Milestein, 1975). The hydridoma cells can then be
propagated almost indefinitely in culture and will continue to
produce the Ab of the lymphocyte parent. Since an individuallymphocyte produces only a single Ab type, all of the Ab
molecules produced by a hybridoma cell line derived from a
single hybrid cell, are identical and have same binding proper-ties. Therefore, the hybridoma technology guarantees the
unlimited production of mAb with constant characteristics
(Hock et al., 1995). Due to great labour required for mAb
production, many IA are still employing pAb. During the last
years a third possibility to create Ab has emerged, i.e. recom-
binant Ab (rAb) techniques (Kramer and Hock, 1996a, b;282
Uzma Maqbool and M. Jamil QureshiChaudhary et al., 1995). Here, immunoglobulin genes can be
cloned, introduced and expressed in expensive and relatively
simple host systems. Although several non-mammalian host
systems (yeast, plant and insect cells) have been used toproduce rAb, the most common vehicle is E. coli  (Hall et al.,
1997; Lee et al., 1995).
Nevertheless, ELISA technique has not been used widely for
pesticide residue analysis. The reasons include, concerns
about interference from substances co-extracted with the
pesticide (the so-called matrix effects), cross-reactivity to
compounds within a group of related chemicals and doubts
that it gives sufficiently quantitative results. But immunoas-
says (IA) offer advantages over chromatographic methods in
terms of cost and simplicity and speed where large number of
similar samples are involved. Very sensitive competitive
immunoassays have also been developed with detection
limits between 1 and 50 mg/l for example for the triazine and
urea herbicides (Pichon et al., 1995; Schneider et al., 1994;
Giersch, 1993).
Development of ELISA technique for pesticides. Pesticide
immunoassays . Commercial ELISA kits are relatively expen-
sive (US $ 300-500 per kit). If single rather than triplicate
analyses are carried out, this would give up to 90 samples at a
cost of about US $ 5 per sample. But very careful pipetting has
to be carried out in order to obtain valid data with single repli-
cates. The current cost of a GC analysis is about US $ 150 per
sample. However, the price of a kit may still be quite expensive
for developing countries like Pakistan (Dankwardt, 1999). If no
kits are commercially available or sample numbers are too great
to be screened using costly commercial kits, other sources of
antibodies and immuno-reagents have to be found. In this
regard, these reagents can be produced at the local laboratory
scale. A variety of IA has been developed for pesticides.
Commercial as well as in-house developed assays, had been
tested in field as well as in laboratory experiments, by several
groups. Different groups working in different parts of the
world have used ELISA for monitoring of different classesof pesticides like organochlorinates, organophosphates,
carbamates, and pyrethyroid (Kim et al., 2007; Gao et al., 2006;
Park et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2003, 2002; Watanabe et al., 2001;
Schneider et al., 1994; Francis and Craston, 1994; Itak et al.,
1993; Gee et al., 1988). There may be research groups from
universities, which have produced surplus antibodies. Anexample of this approach is one group in Germany (Hock et al.,
1994; Kramer et al., 1994) which has explored immunoassays
for pesticides monitoring. Similarly, an American group ofscientists has also developed a variety of ELISAs for a variety
of pesticides (Van Emon et al., 2008; Ahn et al., 2007a, b, 2006,
2004; Mak et al., 2005; Shan et al., 2004; 2000; Lucas et al.,283
Pesticide Immunoassays
1995; 1993; Schneider et al., 1992; Hammock et al., 1990, 1987,
1980; Gee et al., 1988). Even, in India, a group has developed
antibodies for cyclodienes, DDT, DDA, carbendazin/benomyl
and others (Skerritt and Rani, 1996).
s-Triazine immunoassays . Extensive work on ELISA develop-
ment for detection/quantification of triazine group of herbi-cides has also been done (Wittmann and Schmid, 1994;Wittmann and Hock, 1993, 1990; Wust and Hock, 1992; Gohet al., 1992). In all of these studies, they have used ELISA
using polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies with varyingdetection limits ranging from 1 μg/l to a maximum of 40 μg/l.
Field samples were analyzed for cross-reactivity measure-ments. Many of the developed ELISAs are also commerciallyavailable (Dankwardt et al., 1998a; Hennion and Barcelo, 1998).
Atrazine immunoassays . Typical laboratory analysis for
atrazine involves lengthy solvent extraction followed by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) (Lee and Chau 1983; Sirons et
al., 1973) or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
analysis (Dicorcia et al., 1987; Ferris and Haigh, 1987; Vickery
et al., 1980). Immunoassay techniques have been developed
for atrazine, which are relatively inexpensive and can bequickly conducted in the laboratory or at field locations(Dankwardt et al., 1998b; Jiang et al., 1995; Muldoon et al.,
1993; Wust and Hock, 1992; Weller et al., 1992; Schneider and
Hammock, 1992; Van Beveren and Noji, 1991; Wittmann andHock, 1990, 1989; Bushway et al., 1989, 1988; Schlaeppi et al.,
1989).
Present status in Pakistan.  At present, herbicides are exten-
sively used to control weeds in crops. For these herbicides,many ELISA tests have been developed in the environmentalmonitoring programme. Interest in the use and developmentof IA techniques for pesticide residue analysis has grownworldwide over the years, but in Pakistan a little work hasbeen done and IAs have yet to be utilized to their full potential(Maqbool et al., 2008, 2002, 1998a, b; Maqbool, 2003; Maqbool
and Qureshi, 1994). Pioneer studies were initiated to use com-mercial ELISA kits for pesticide residue analysis. These kitsperformed successful standardization and residue analysisof dieldrin, DDT/DDE and atrazine in soil and water (Maqboolet al., 1998a, b; Maqbool and Qureshi, 1994). These studies
lead to thinking that this cost-effective technique should bedeveloped under local environmental conditions, so that allthe virtues of this technology can be fully utilized. Although,commercial ELISA tests are cheaper than GC or HPLC, theyare still quite costly for developing countries. Production ofpolyclonal antibodies against pesticides in a developingcountry like Pakistan can remarkably reduce the price ofELISA kits (Skerritt and Rani, 1996; Dankwardt et al., 1995).For this purpose, studies were initiated to develop and
standardize an in-house ELISA kit for s-triazine (specifically
atrazine) detection and determination at the residue levels
in different environmental samples (Maqbool et al., 2002).
Atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino- s-triazine)
is a s-triazine herbicide which prevents the growth of suscep-
tible weed species by inhibition of photosynthesis. Depen-ding on the weed infestation, atrazine may be used alone or
mixed with other herbicides to control s-triazine resistant
weeds or grasses. In Pakistan, atrazine is used in combinationwith different other herbicides like ametryn [2,4-diamine,
N-ethyl- N’-(1-methylethyl)-6-(methylthio)-1,3,5, triazine],
cyanazine 2-[(4-chloro-6(ethylamino)-1,3,5-triazine-2yl)amino)-methyl-] and metolachlor [2-chloro-N-(2-ethyl-6-
methylphenyl)-N-(2-methoxy-1-methylethyl) (Saleem and
Haq, 2003). Atrazine is degraded by different mechanisms inwater, soil, plant, food and environment and immunoassay
has been used for its determination in different types of
matrices (Dankwardt et al., 1998b, 1994; Hardy and Hurburg,
1994; Wittmann and Hock, 1993; 1990; Winklemann and Klain,
1991; Dunbar et al., 1985).
The need for validation of newly developed ELISAs either
by HPLC or GC/MS is recognized (Dankwardt et al., 1997;
Brady et al., 1995; Dankwardt et al., 1995; Mountfort et al.,
1994; Thurman et al., 1990; Penegelley, 1985). This in-house
developed ELISA was also validated by comparing it with
ELISA itself, (internal validation) and by HPLC (external
validation) for its sensitivity, robustness and reproducibilitywith HPLC for atrazine residue determination in different
environmental samples. The details of these studies are as
under:
In-house development of ELISA for atrazine residue determi-
nation in Pakistan.  A highly sensitive enzyme immunoassay
has been developed, optimized and evaluated at the labora-tory scale for the detection of atrazine residues. The hapten
(atrazine derivative) was conjugated to bovine serum albumin
(BSA) to obtain an immunizing antigen and to horseradishperoxidase enzyme (POD) to have enzyme tracer. The forma-
tion of these conjugations was confirmed by UV spectroscopy
as well as by gel-electrophoresis. Coupling was evaluated bythe change in UV absorbance i.e., in conjugate, shifting of
the peak to a different position as compared with atrazine
derivative and BSA. The absorbance increase depends uponthe hapten density after coupling. The molar ratios of the
conjugate were determined by UV spectra, assuming that the
absorbances of BSA and modified hapten were additive. Thisconjugation procedure yielded 29-atrazine residues/BSA
molecule. With this atrazine-BSA conjugate, polyclonal anti-
bodies were raised in rabbits by immunization. An ELISA onmicrotitration plates was optimized with peroxidase-atrazine
conjugate. The middle of the test (50% B/Bo) was found to be
at 90 ng/l, which is well below the maximum concentration
permitted by the EC guidelines for drinking water. Detectionlimits for atrazine of about 1 ng/l could be reached. The assay
did not require concentration or clean up steps for drinking or
ground water samples. Validation experiments showed a goodaccuracy and precision. No cross-reactivities were shown by
other s-triazines like terbutryn, ametryn, terbuthylazine,
desisopropylatrazine, de-ethylatrazine except terbuthylazine(17%) and hydroxyatrazine (30%) (Maqbool et al., 2002).
Internal (by ELISA itself) as well as external validations (by
HPLC) of this developed ELISA showed good accuracy and
precision for reproducibility. In-house developed ELISA was
standardized to monitor atrazine residues in different environ-mental samples. The standard curve was linear, indicating an
increase in log concentration with decrease in absorbance
(%B/B0 = 1.075-0.042 Log C; r = -0.966). The middle of the testwas at 75 ng/l and the lowest detection limit at 4 ng/l. ELISA
significantly correlated with the high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) (r = 0.990). Internal validationshowed good accuracy and precision. Maximum atrazine
residues were present in Jehlum River water/sediments and
maize/sugarcane plant roots. Most of the food samples werefound contaminated. ELISA required less clean-up steps than
HPLC, but showed matrix effect in soil/coloured extracts
(Maqbool et al., 2008).
It is concluded that the newly developed ELISA is sensitive,
reproducible, cheaper and require fewer clean-up steps than
HPLC for atrazine monitoring in water and low-coloured sample
extracts. It significantly correlated with HPLC estimates and
detected appreciable amounts of atrazine residues in water,
sediment, soil, plant portions and food samples. Water samples
were analyzed directly. For low-coloured extract, an increase
in settling period, and one-step filtration improved ELISA
performance, but for highly coloured matrices, repeated
clean-up steps and matrix effect calibrations have to beapplied. In contrast, HPLC required filtration, centrifugation,
and solid-phase extraction for all types of matrices including
water. The running cost of in-house developed ELISA is
US$ 3 per sample for triplicate analysis. On this cost/benefit
basis, an integrated approach is suggested to use ELISA first
for screening and only positive samples should be subjected
to instrumental techniques like GC, HPLC or GC/MS. Based
on these results, it is suggested that this test can be applied
to obtain fairly accurate results for atrazine concentration in
water samples from different sources.
Recommendations for future.  The strength of immunochemi-
cal methods lies in the screening of a large number of samples284
Uzma Maqbool and M. Jamil Qureshiwithin a short time at low costs. Therefore, they can be valu-
able supplements to conventional analytical methods. Impor-
tant applications are seen in the analysis of ground and
drinking water, where matrix effects are seldom observed. Also,food commodities that turn over quickly are ideal targets for
IA measurements. Due to the low costs of one analysis, more
replicates from one site can be measured or special sites canbe sampled more often, enabling more information about
variations of analyte concentrations over sites and seasons
(Dankwardt, 1999).
Some restrictions are imposed by the fact that IA is single
analyte method. However, new approaches for multianalyte
measurements are being undertaken, such as the integrationof IA with liquid chromatography (LC). Here, Abs are used in
conjunction with LC, e.g., to concentrate an analyte from a
large volume of sample and separate it from an interferingmatrix (Katmeh et al., 1997; Lawrence et al., 1996; Kramer
et al ., 1994). In this case, LC uses an immunoadsorbent
column before analysis. The immunoadsorbent columncontains immobilized specific Abs, which bind the analyte,
while interfering substances pass through. The analyte can
be eluted by using a pH gradient or an organic solvent(Marx and Geirsch, 1995; Pichon et al., 1995). Therefore, large
sample volumes with low concentrations of the analyte can
be reduced to small volumes with sufficiently high concentra-tions without co-extracting interfering substances like humic
acids or food compounds. This raises the effective sensitivity
of the analysis. Antibody mixtures can be used to bind sub-stances from different compound classes, e.g., the phenyl
urea herbicides and the triazines. Immunoadsorbents are now
commercially available.
When cross-reacting Abs are applied in IA, the obtained
signal is not only related to the analyte, but also to similar
compounds. This problem can be circumvented by the use ofLC prior to the IA. LC-IA was applied by Kramer et al. (1994),
to determine 4-nitrophenols. The nitrophenols were separated
with different LC-systems and determined by IA. LC-IA wasabout 8-10 times more sensitive than LC with UV detection.
Therefore, the integration of LC with IA combines the high
separation quality of the LC and the sensitivity of an IA(Lucas et al ., 1995; Frutos and Regnier, 1993). Another
approach is seen in the performance of a homogeneous IA
without tracer followed by the separation of the bound andthe free reaction partners and the quantification of the bound
and the free Ab fraction immuno-LC (Dankwardt, 1999; Hock
et al., 1995). Hybrid LC/MS systems allow the subsequent
identification of the bound analyte. The problem of cross-
reactivities inherent to all IA is therefore, resolved by the
structural analysis of any cross-reacting compound.Furthermore, multi-analyte systems are under development.
One concept is the microspot IA (Ekins et al., 1990), which
uses many microspots with fluorescence-labelled Abs of
different selectivity immobilized on a ship. After incubationwith the analyte (antigen or hapten) a fluorescence-labelled
tracer Ab is added. The tracer Ab is either directed against the
antigen or consists of an anti-idiotype Ab directed against thebinding site of the capture antibody. Sensor and tracer Ab
carry different fluorescence labels. Therefore, it is possible
to determine the amount of analyte bound to the sensor Abwith optical scanning methods by measuring the signal ratio
(radiometric assay). Lately, a variety of non-competitive and
competitive microspot analysis systems have been developed,mainly related to the medical field (Chu et al., 1997), but are
clearly of particular importance in areas such as environmen-
tal monitoring. Another possibility is the use of cross-reactingAbs for multianalyte detection. Known cross-reactivities of
different Abs can be used to calculate various concentrations
of different analytes in a sample containing several contami-nants (Muldoon et al., 1993). The estimation of the individual
concentration is carried out by complex calculating procedures,
e.g. by neural networks or iterative procedures (Jones et al.,
1997; Wittmann et al., 1997).
Immunochemical analysis is a fast developing field with
numerous possibilities for further improvement. Much effortis put into the development of continuous measurements, such
a flow injection immunoanalysis (FIIA) and immunosensors
(Rigo and Hock, 1997; Kramer, 1996). A quasi-continuous FIIAof pesticides was developed by Kramer and Schmid (1991) on
the basis of a competitive IA. Here, the Abs are immobilized on
a membrane. The reaction takes place in the membrane reactor,the central part of the flow injection system. All reagents are
sequentially added to the reactor and the product is assayed
with the aid of a flow fluorimeter. The measuring range ofthe flow injection analysis almost equals that of the EIA.
Wittmann and Schmid (1994) used an Ab   column reactor
filled with polystyrene or glass beads with the Ab, immobi-lized via the avidin/biotin system. This system showed a
stable Ab activity for a minimum of 500 measuring cycles.
Detection limits for atrazine of about 1 ng/l with pAb and30 ng/l with mAb could be reached.
Important progress is to be expected in the field of immuno-
sensors where the detectors are based on Ab (Rigo and Hock,1997). Some relatively simple devices are dipsticks or dot-blots
and immunofiltration test. The test principle is the same as for
the microtiter plate tests but the reaction time is much shorterdue to the high surface area of the membrane and the short
distance between reaction partners. Application of remission
measurements yields a proportional relationship between285
Pesticide Immunoassaysanalyte and remitted light. By using a pocket reflectometer,
this set-up is ideally suited for field-monitoring purposes
(Niessner, 1994). An interesting development is liposome-
amplified immunomigration strips (Seibert et al., 1995; Reeves
et al., 1995a). They employed liposome-encapsulated markers
which act as single-enhancers of the competitive binding
reaction instead of enzymes. These devices have been usedfor the determination of alachlor (Wittman and Schmid, 1994).
If a pesticide of interest is conjugated to a lipid, it can also be
incorporated into the liposome structure, leading to a compe-titive liposome IA (Reeves et al., 1995b).
In more complicated systems, the immunological recognition
system is immobilized in the direct vicinity of a transducer,an electrochemical, and optical or gravimetric device. They
respond to chemical compounds or ions and yield electrical
signals, which depend on the concentration of the analyte.Immunosensors with piezoelectric crystals as physical
sensors are in a relatively advanced state of development
(Minnunni et al., 1995). They function as microbalances on to
which Ab are immobilized. Other physical sensors use optical
systems such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), interfer-
ometry or grating couplers (Brecht et al ., 1995; Bier and
Schmid, 1994). A biosensor employing SPR was used for the
determination of atrazine. Bier and Schmid used a grating
coupler immunosensor for the determination of terbutryn, atriazine herbicide. A detection limit of 15 nmol/l was estab-
lished.
Also new strategies for Ab production are being developed.
Genetically engineered monoclonal Abs appear very attrac-
tive because their selectivity and affinity can be tailored by
site directed mutations without requiring new immunizations(Barbas and Burton, 1996). Methods are now provided to
rapidly isolate desired clones from Ab libraries and to mani-
pulate individual recombinant antibodies (rAb) to matchspecific demands of environmental analysis. Binding proteins
derived from Ab but consisting only of a part of their light or
heavy chain and recombinant Ab fragments (Fab) directedagainst different s-triazines, diuron and parathion have been
produced (Bryne et al., 1996; Ward et al., 1993). In several
cases, the detection limit of the rAb was the same as with theparent mAb (Garrett et al., 1997; Kramer and Hock, 1996a, b;
Karu et al., 1994). A promising goal is completely synthetic
production of binding proteins or other synthetic receptors,which are fitted to the structure of the analyte by molecular
design. The use of libraries guarantees to overcome the
bottleneck in Ab production. Also, Ab with special propertiessuch as resistance to matrix effects or organic solvent stabi-
lity can be selected from the libraries, providing an important
contribution to the analysis of water, soil and food samples.All this review of literature strongly recommends that immu-
noassays have great potential to play a vital role in environ-
mental protection issues. Such new trends are direly needed
in a developing country like Pakistan, where the personsdirectly engaged with practical pesticide use, are commonly
illiterate. They are using these toxicants continuously without
any proper training. Sometimes, their illiteracy results inmisuse of these toxicants ultimately polluting the whole
ecosystem. ELISA development studies have great potential
to be explored for most commonly used pesticides such aspyrethroids (extensively used for cotton crop production) and
herbicides in drinking water. This type of research has been
done extensively in the developed countries (Van Emon et al.,
2008; Ahn et al., 2007a, b, 2006, 2004; Mak et al., 2005; Shan
et al., 2004; 2000; Lucas et al., 1995, 1993; Schneider et al.,
1992; Hammock et al., 1990, 1987, Gee et al., 1988; Hammock
and Mumma, 1980) but no work has been done in Pakistan.
This is an area to be explored and researched in future.
