Abstract  
 
 
The libraries generated by high -throughput single cell RNA -sequencing platforms such as the 
Chromium from 10x Genomics require considerable amounts of sequencing, typically due to the 
large number of cells. The ability to use this data to address biological questions is directly 
impacted by the quality of the sequence data. Here we have compared the performance of the 
Illumina NextSeq 500 and NovaSeq 6000 against the BGI MGISEQ -2000 platform using identical 
Single Cell 3’ libraries consisting of over 70,000 cells. Our results demonstrate a highly 
comparable performance between the NovaSeq 6000 and MGISEQ -2000 in sequencing quality, 
and cell, UMI, and gene detection. However, compared with the NextSeq 500, the MGISEQ -2000 
platform performs consistently better, identifying more cells, genes, and UMIs at equalised read 
depth. We were able to call an additional 1,065,659  SNPs fr om sequence data generated by the 
BGI platform, enabling an additional 14% of cells to be assigned to the correct donor from a 
multiplexed library. However, both the NextSeq 500 and MGISEQ -2000 detected similar 
frequencies of gRNAs from a pooled CRISPR sin gle cell screen. Our study provides a benchmark 
for high capacity sequencing platforms applied to high -throughput single cell RNA -seq libraries.

The human genome project was an important achievement in life sciences and paved the way 
for major technology developments in DNA and RNA sequencing. The development of synthesis -
based Next -Generation Sequencing (NGS, also known as massively parallel or high -throughput 
sequencing) was pioneered by Solexa (1). After the company’s acquisition by Illumina, this 
technology was refined further and gave rise to a number of platforms that include the NextSeq, 
HiSeq and NovaSeq sequencers. These platforms have now produced the majority of the publicly 
available human sequencing data. Over time the cost of sequencing has decreased and the 
technology has become more accessible, both in terms of sequence hardware and tools for 
analysis (2). Collectivel y, this has resulted in NGS being adopted by many researchers, and used 
in clinical and industry settings.  
 
Until recently, the majority of libraries sequenced have been generated on ‘bulk’ samples, 
consisting of the DNA or RNA collected from millions of cells. However, advances in single cell 
library preparation techniques (3, 4)  have made it possible to produce sequencing libraries from 
tens of thousands of individually barcoded cells, and even individually barcoded molecules. High -
throughput library preparation methods, such as the Chromium platform from 10x Genomics (5), 
are now widely available, enabling libraries consisting of tens of tho usands of cells to be 
generated in several hours. The cDNA libraries from the Chromium experiments differ from ‘bulk’ 
libraries in that each cDNA molecule contains a Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) and shared cell 
barcode. After amplification cDNAs are s heared, and adapter and sample indices are 
incorporated into finished libraries, which are compatible with next -generation short -read 
sequencing.   
 
In 2017 BGI launched the MGISEQ -2000 as an alternative to existing short -read sequencing 
technologies (6). The technology underlying the MGISEQ -2000 combines DNA nanoball (DNB) 
nanoarrays (7) with polymerase -based stepwise sequencing (DNBseq), and its us e has recently 
been validated as comparative in performance to the Illumina platforms when sequencing small 
noncoding RNAs (8), bulk transcriptomes (9), as well as whole genome DNA (10). To fully explore .

Illumina technology by building scRNA -seq libraries generated with the Chromium platform from 
10x genomics and sequencing 70,000  cells on both the MGISEQ -2000 and Illumina N extSeq 500, 
and NovaSeq 6000 (Figure 1).  
 
Results  
 
Sequencing quality metrics  
The total number of reads generated for the four libraries on the Illumina platforms was 159 -616 
million, and 1,112 -1,339 million using the BGI platform. Comparison of sequencing quality control 
metrics revealed similar percentages of detectable valid cell ba rcodes, with a 0.8 -1.2% greater 
detection from the NextSeq 500 and 1% from the NovaSeq 6000 (Table 1). The probability of a 
sequencing error is represented by a nucleotide base Q score, and thus the slightly higher 
percentages of valid cell barcodes from I llumina platforms most likely reflects the 5.1 -6.8% 
(NextSeq 500) and 4.3 -5.6% (NovaSeq 6000) higher Q30 scores observed in the cell barcode 
region of the reads compared to the MGISEQ -2000  (Table 1). A valid barcode is one that is 
detected from the sequenc e data that matches a whitelist of approximately 737,000 possible 
barcodes for the 3’ assay. The effect on the percentage of valid barcodes caused by lower Q30 
score is partly mitigated by the Cell Ranger pipeline, which includes a step to correct for pote ntial 
sequencing errors in the cell barcode based on a posterior probability that an observed barcode 
originated from the whitelist barcode. The second step in calling cells is based on the distribution 
and total counts of UMIs assigned to a given cell. We  observed increased percentages of Q30 
scores of 4.9 -6.8% (NextSeq 500) and 4.1 -5.9% (NovaSeq 6000) compared with the MGISEQ -2000 
(Table 1).   
 
The cell barcode and UMI enable individual cells to be identified for subsequent analysis, but 
these bases are o bviously trimmed for the alignment stage. Accurate alignment to a reference 
transcriptome is partly a function of the sequencing error rate, and here we observe a dramatic 
difference in the Q30 percentage for the RNA transcript part of the read, with the M GISEQ -2000 .

performance compared with the NovaSeq 6000 (Table 1). The reduction in sequencing accuracy 
for scRNA -seq libraries on a NextSeq 500 has previously been discussed (11), and it has been 
hypothesised that  this is due to flow cell surface chemistry. While variation in performance of 
specific flow cell lot numbers has been observed, it is important to note that the flowcells used 
here are not from a reported low -performance lot number.  
 
The combination of as signing reads to a given cell, a transcript molecule, and aligning to a 
reference sequence directly affects the number of usable reads that are obtained from sequence 
data. Collectively, differences in the sequencing accuracy between platforms over the ent ire read 
length has consequential effects on the percentage of reads that pass quality control and that 
are able to be mapped to the reference genome. When we integrated the percentage of the 
reads that were able to be aligned to the GRCh38 (release 88) re ference genome, we obtain an 
11.1 -17.2% difference between the NextSeq 500 and MGISEQ -2000, while the difference 
between the NovaSeq 6000 and MGISEQ -2000 is only 1.8 -2.7% (Table 1). The lower percentage 
of alignment seen from the NextSeq 500 libraries is m ost likely due to the lower sequencing 
accuracy in the RNA transcript part of the read, as supported by the observation that the Q30 in 
RNA for Nextseq was much lower than that for MGISEQ -2000 (Table1) . Because the thresholds used 
to determine if a read al igns to the genome are the same, the lower sequencing accuracy should 
not affect the biological interpretation of the aligned data. However, it does mean libraries 
sequenced on a NextSeq 500 will need to be sequenced at a greater depth to obtain the same 
sequencing depth of aligned reads per cell.  
 
Identification of cells, genes, and transcript molecules  
 
To evaluate the similarity in the ability of sequencing platforms to identify the same cells, 
transcript molecules, and genes, we standardised the read d epth between samples by 
downsampling. As the same cells from each sample had been sequenced on two platforms, we 
evaluated cell identification based on the observation of same cell barcode. Each of the two 
platforms identified close to 100% of cells in com mon in the four samples (Figure 2a). For cells .

It is made available The copyright holder for this preprint (which was this version posted February 24, 2019. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/552588doi: bioRxiv preprint identified by only one platform, the mean number of UMIs are on average one log2 lower than 
the cells identified as common between platforms (Figure 2b). There is a lower concordance of 
shared genes for these cells, suggesting that these ‘platform specific’ cells are possibly cell free 
transcripts that have not been adequately detected during quality control filtering by the cell 
singlet detection algorithm . An alternative explanation is that these are cells wi th low 
transcriptional abundance, although we observe no evidence for this scenario.  
 
Gene detection was similarly at high concordance with 89.7 -93.3% of genes detected by both 
platforms for the four samples (Figure 2c). For all samples a subset of genes were detected by a 
single platform. The percentages of genes detected by a single platform were approximately 
equal for NextSeq 500 vs MGISEQ -2000, while the NovaSeq 6000 identified an additional 1.5 -
1.9% of genes. Details of the the genes detected from ea ch platform are provided in Supporting 
Material Tables 1 -4. Based on the number of UMIs, genes detected by a single platform were 
very lowly expressed, and variation in detection is expected due to the level of expression. To 
further confirm this, we downs ampled to an average of 105 reads per sample and repeated the 
comparison of gene detection. Interestingly, the NextSeq 500 detected an additional 0.8 -1.7% 
genes in the iPSC and TMWC datasets, while the MGISEQ -2000 detected an additional 0.2 -0.6% 
genes in t he PBMC datasets.  
 
The capture efficiency in gene detection levels, based on the relationship between the mean 
UMIs per gene and the number of genes detected was a similar for the iPSC and human trabecular 
meshwork cells (TMWC) samples sequenced on the Nex tSeq 500 and MGISEQ -2000. However, 
we observed a slight increase in the capture efficiency for the two PBMC samples sequenced on 
the NovaSeq 6000 in comparison to the MGISEQ -2000 (Figure 3a). This is likely a function of the 
slightly higher sequencing accu racy in the UMI region of the read (Table 1), corresponding to an 
increase in the mean UMIs per cell from the NovaSeq 6000 (Table 2). As expected we observe a 
marginal increase in the estimated dropout rate for the two PBMC samples from the MGISEQ -
2000 com pared with the NovaSeq 6000 (Figure 3b), although the correlation across all cells was 
high (0.989 and 0.988 respectively). Interestingly, there is no mean difference in the estimated .

3b), and while the correlations across cells is lower (0.988 and 0.954 respectively) this is likely a 
function of the lower read depths for these samples, combined with greater variation in 
sequencing quality between platforms (Table 1). How ever, taken together, our analyses show 
that the gene detection, and quantification of transcript molecules via UMIs is highly consistent 
across platforms (Figure 3c -d). 
 
Identification of genetic variation and CRISPR guides  
 
The ability to call single nuc leotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from scRNA -seq data allows 
researchers to use multiplexing strategies in the library generation stage, reducing the overall 
cost of running experiments where large sample sizes are needed (12). The power of 
demultiplexing a cell back to an individual donor is partly a function of the number of SNPs that 
can confidently be called from the short RNA section of the read. Using the iPSC sample, which 
comprises of cells multiplex ed from two unrelated donors, we assigned cells to an origin donor 
by calling SNPs from the equalised total reads of sequence data generated by the NextSeq 500 
and MGISEQ -2000 using the demuxlet algorithm (12). Donor identity was confirmed using 
genotyped SNPs from an Illumina Global Screening array that had been imputed to the Haplotype 
Reference Consortium panel (13). Despite equalised read depths across platforms, we identified 
an additional 1,065,659 SNPs from the MGISEQ -2000 data. The additional SNPs allowed demuxlet 
to assign an additional 1,694 cells to the correct donor (Table 3, Figure 4), with the greater SNP 
detection likely due to the higher sequencing quality of the MGISEQ -2000 reads (Table 1). To 
verify that this was not a function of differences in the base -pair length of the RNA section of the 
read, we trimmed the BGI data to a total RNA -read length of 98 bp and re -called SNPs, and could 
still correctly identify an additional 1,663 cells.  
 
Finally, we evaluated the ability to detect the inserted guide RNAs (gRNA) from the TMWC that 
had been transfected with a CRISPR pool targeting 128 loci with the CROP -seq protocol. The 
guides are targeted to be inserted in the 3’ end of the gene and thus detectable from short -read .

We observed consistent detection of the number of cells per guide, and the 
number of UMIs per guide across both the NextSeq 500 and MGISEQ -2000 (Figure 4).   
 
Discussion  
 
To our knowledge, this study is the first to utilize MGISEQ -2000 platform for scRNA -seq, and the 
first to compare sequence performance for the widely used 10x Chromium platform against 
Illumina platforms. Our comp rehensive benchmarking utilizes data from over 70,000 cells, and 
shows that the MGISEQ -2000 has to be highly comparable performance across a range of 
modalities to the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform, while being more cost effective (Supporting 
material tab le 5). When considering sequencing quality, as well as cell, UMI, and gene detection 
for single cell RNA -sequencing experiments, we found the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 and BGI 
MGISEQ -2000 platforms generated highly comparable data. Interestingly however, compa red 
with the NextSeq 500, at equalised read depth, the BGI platform performs consistently better, 
identifying more cells, genes, and UMIs. We were able to call an additional 1,065,659  SNPs from 
sequence data generated by the BGI platform, enabling an addit ional one in seven cells to be 
assigned to the correct donor from a multiplexed library. It is also noteworthy that the NextSeq 
500 and MGISEQ -2000 detected similar frequencing of gRNAs from a pooled CRISPR single cell 
screen. This work provides a benchmar k for high capacity sequencing platforms applied to high -
throughput single cell RNA -seq libraries.  
 
Methods  
 
Description of the single cell datasets and cell collection details  
 
A total of four scRNA -seq libraries were generated from three experimental sc enarios, chosen to 
evaluate the ability of sequencing platforms to provide sufficient information to detect features 
such as germline genetic variation and CRISPR inserts. All experimental work performed in this 
study was approved by the Human Research Eth ics committee (HREC) of the Royal Victorian Eye 
and Ear Hospital (11/1031H; 13/1151H) or the Tasmanian Health and Medical HREC (H0012902)  .

& Medical Research Cou ncil of Australia (NHMRC).  
 
iPSC  - Consisted of undifferentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) maintained 
with StemFlex (ThermoFisher Scientific) that were derived from two unrelated individuals (14). 
Colonies were harvested using ReleSRTM (Stem Cell Tech) and were dissociated into a single cell 
suspension. Cells were counted and assessed for viability with Trypan Blue using a Countess II 
automa ted counter (Thermo Fisher Scientific), then pooled at a concentration of 391 -663 cells/µL 
(3.91x105 - 6.63x105 cells/mL). Final cell viability estimates ranged between 95 -97%. The two cell 
lines were then genotyped separately using the Infinium HumanCore -24 v1.1 BeadChip assay 
(Illumina), and SNPs were called from this assay with GenomeStudioTM V2.0 (Illumina). To  
generate the libraries, cells were partitioned and barcoded using high -throughput droplet 10x 
Genomics Chromium Controller (10x Genomics, USA) and the Single Cell 3' Library and Gel Bead 
Kit (V2; 10x Genomics; PN -120237). The estimated number of cells in each well in the Chromium 
chip was optimized to capture approximately 10,000 cells. GEM generation and barcoding, cDNA 
amplification, and library construction were performed according to standard protocol.  
 
TMWC - Comprised of cultured human trabecular me shwork cells (TMWCs) that had been 
transfected with a CROP -seq (Addgene: 99248) guide RNA (gRNA) pool targeting 128 loci, with 
the guides targeted to be inserted in the 3’ end of the the gene and thus detectable from short -
read sequence data. TMWCs were pl ated in T75 flasks and transfected with a pooled single guide 
RNA (sgRNA) library lentivirus containing sgRNA for 128 targets, 10 of which were control genes. 
Cells were harvested 7 days after virus transduction and were FACS sorted for EGFP -positive 
and v iable cells (propidium iodide -negative cells) before applying to the Chromium System (10x 
Genomics) single cell RNA -sequencing workflow. Single cell suspensions were used to generate 
a Chromium library using the Chromium Single Cell 3’ v2 Library (10x Geno mics; PC -120237). 
The estimated number of cells in each well in the Chromium chip was optimized to capture 
approximately 10,000 cells.

total of 28 unrelated individu als. Peripheral blood samples were collected in Vacutainer Cell 
Preparation Tubes containing sodium heparin and ficoll (BD Biosciences: 362753), and were 
processed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Following separation, PBMCs 
were cryopreser ved and stored. Samples were subsequently thawed, and each library contained 
a pool of PBMCs from 14 donors, with 40,000 cells loaded to achieve a targeted 20,000 cells per

Illumina NextSeq 500 and NovaSeq 6000 sequencing  
The iPSC and TMWC libra ries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 (NextSeq control 
software v2.0.2/ Real Time Analysis v2.4.11) using a 150 cycle NextSeq High Output Reagent Kit 
v2 in stand -alone mode as follows: 26bp (Read 1), 8bp (Index), and 98bp (Read 2). The NextSeq 
500 sequencing was performed by the Institute of Molecular Bioscience sequencing core facility. 
The two PBMC libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Software version: 1.4) 
using a 2x150 cycle S4 flowcell in standalone mode. The NovaSeq 6000 sequ encing was 
performed by the Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics Sequencing core facility.  
 
BGI MGISEQ -2000  sequencing  
Libraries generated using the 10x Genomics Chromium system require a conversion step using 
the MGIEasy Universal Library Conversion  kit (App -A) (Part Number: 1000004155) before 
sequencing can be performed on the MGISEQ -2000 instrument. For each library, 10ng was 
amplified using 10 cycles of PCR to incorporate a 5’ phosphorylation on the forward strand only. 
Purified PCR product was th en denatured and mixed with a “splint” oligonucleotide that is 
homologous to the P5 and P7 adapter regions of the library to generate a circle (Figure S1). A 
ligase reaction was then performed to create a complete ssDNA circle of the forward strand then 
an exonuclease digest was performed to remove single stranded non -circularized DNA 
molecules. Circular ssDNA molecules then underwent Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) to 
generate 300 -500 faithful copies of the libraries which then fold upon themselves to b ecome 
DNA Nanoballs (DNB). Each DNB library was then flowed across a 1,500M feature patterned array .

A) (PE100) (Part Number: 1000005662). The custom cycle mode on th e instrument was run to 
allow 26bp (Read 1) and 100bp (Read 2) cycles without a index barcode read due to only one 
sample being run per flow cell, and FASTQ files were generated locally on the instrument. 
Sequencing was performed in BGI Shenzhen, MGI R&D f acility.  
 
Bioinformatic and computational analysis  
Sequencing data from both platforms were processed into transcript count tables using the Cell 
Ranger Single Cell Software Suite version 2.2.0 by 10x Genomics 
(http://www.10xgenomics.com/ ).  Base calls from the NextSeq 500 and NovaSeq 6000 Illumina 
sequencers were pre -processed as described by Zheng et al. (5). Base calls from the MGISEQ -
2000 were pre -processed  as described by Huang et al. (15) into demultiplexed, processed reads. 
The BGI -formatted headers of the resulting FASTQ reads were converted to Illumina -formatted 
headers using custom Python scripts t hat are included with this publication’s accompanying 
repository. The quality of the raw sequencing data was assessed with FastQC v0.11.7 (16). The 
FASTQ files for both platforms were then processed wi th the cellranger count  pipeline, where 
each sample was processed independently to generate the transcript count tables. Using STAR 
v2.5.1b (17), the iPSC library was mapped to the GRCh37/hg19 genome  (release 84), while the 
PBMC libraries were mapped to the GRCh38 (release 88) Homo sapiens  genome. The TMWC 
library was mapped to the GRCh38 (release 88) Homo sapiens  genome that was spiked with gRNA 
and CROP -seq-associated sequences. This reference was p repared as described by Datlinger et 
al. (18). We note that, since the expression data is limited to the 3’ end of a gene and we used 
gene -level annotations, differences between reference versions, suc h as GRCh38, are unlikely to 
significantly alter conclusions. The resulting mapped counts for each pair of samples were then 
depth -equalized using the cellranger aggr  pipeline, which downsampled raw reads from the 
higher -depth BGI library until the mean re ad depth per cell was equal to the mean read depth 
per cell of the Illumina library.  Downsampling of mapped data to 105 reads per sample was 
performed with DropletUtils (19).

data. Statistical analyses were performed in R, using the ascend  (20), scran (21), biomaRt (22) 
and M3Drop (23) packages. First, the count matrices were loaded into R and separated by 
platform. Cell barcodes were extracted from the matrices and those detected by both platforms 
were identified. The genes of these cells were then compared in terms of identity and 
distribution. Counts from each platform underwent quality control separately. A cell quality 
matrix based on the fo llowing data types: library size (total mapped reads), total number of genes 
detected, percent of reads mapped to mitochondrial genes, and percent of reads mapped to 
ribosomal genes. Cells that had any of the four parameter measurements higher than 3x medi an 
absolute deviation (MAD) of all cells were considered outliers and removed from subsequent 
analysis (Table S1) . Next, we applied two thresholds to remove cells with mitochondrial reads 
above 20% or ribosomal reads above 50% (Table S1). To exclude genes that were potentially 
detected from random noise, we removed genes that were detected in fewer than 0.1% of all 
cells. The data from both platforms were combined back into one dataset. The NBDrop function 
from the M3Drop R package was used on filtered, un -normalised UMI counts to compare dropout 
rates between platforms. Abundantly expressed ribosomal protein genes and mitochondrial 
genes were then discarded to minimize the influence of those genes in driving clustering and 
differential expression analysis. Cell-cell normalization was performed using the deconvolution 
method described by (21). The correlation of gene expression between platforms was calculated 
using normalised UMI counts. To evaluate capt ure efficiency and transcript length bias of genes, 
gene lengths were calculated by summing exonic lengths retrieved from from the ENSEMBL 
Homo sapiens gene database. These values were then plotted as shown in Figure S2.  
 
Additi onal analyses were conducted on the iPSC and TMWC samples to evaluate the influence of 
sequencing platform on properties specific to these experiments. Using genotype information 
from that was generated as described in (14), SNPs were called from the iPSC sample using

alignments from UMIs detected in the downs ampled data were used. As the MGISEQ -2000

Exper imental design . Preparation of single cell libraries and sequencing using Illumina and BGI 
platforms and subsequent analysis. A: Human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells ( iPSC ) were 
generated generated from a human donor and underwent SNP genotyping in addition to scRNA -
seq. B: Trabecular MeshWork Cells ( TMWC ) derived from iPSCs were screened with a CRISPR -
based molecular screen (CROP -seq).  C: Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC ). Single cell 
libraries were prepared from two individual pools of PBMCs.

Cell barcodes and UMIs detected by platforms. We observed a high concordance of cell barcodes 
detected in common to both platforms (A), and the distributions o f the Total UMI counts 
associated with a cell barcode shows a low average UMIs for cell barcodes detected by one 
platform (B). In each sample, both platforms detected similar total numbers of genes (C), 
although the mean of the UMIs for genes detected by a  single platform shows that platform bias 
in gene detection was limited to lowly expressed genes (D).

Comparison of gene capture between platforms. A: Capture efficiency of each platform. 
Efficiency is evaluated from the number of genes with the mean number of transcripts of a gene 
expressed by a cell. B: Correlation of dropout rate between platforms. Dropout rates for each 
platform were calculated by the DANB model from M3Drop package. C: Principal Components 
one and two calculated from 1,500  of the most variable genes. D: Correlation of gene expression 
in cells identified by both sequencing platforms. Correlation of each cell is represented in the 
histograms, while the expression values of genes in the cells with the lowest and highest 
correl ations are represented in the scatter plots.
