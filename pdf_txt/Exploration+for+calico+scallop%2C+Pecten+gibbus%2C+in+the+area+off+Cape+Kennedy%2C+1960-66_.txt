National Marine Fisheries Service, Circulars
Themajor responsibilities oftheNational Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) aretomonitor and assess the
abundance andgeographic distribution offishery resources, tounderstand andpredict fluctuations inthequan-
tityanddistribution ofthese resources, and toestablish levels foroptimum useoftheresources. NMFS isalso
charged with thedevelopment andimplementation ofpolicies formanaging national fishing grounds, develop-
ment andenforcement ofdomestic fisheries regulations, surveillance offoreign fishing offUnited States coastal
waters, andthedevelopment andenforcement ofinternational fishery agreements and policies. NMFS also
assists thefishing industry through marketing service andeconomic analysis programs, andmortgage insurance
andvessel construction subsidies. Itcollects, analyses, andpublishes statistics onvarious phases oftheindustry.
TheNOAA Technical ReportNMFS CIRC series continues aseries thathasbeen inexistence since 1941. The
Circulars aretechnical publications ofgeneral interest intended toaidconservation andmanagement. Publica-
tions thatreview inconsiderable detail andatahigh technical level certain broad areas ofresearch appear in
this series. Technical papers originating ineconomics studies andfrom management investigations appear in

294. Bottom trawl explorations inLake Superi-
or,1963-65. ByNorman J.Reigle, Jr.Jan-
uary 1969, 25pp.,11figs., 5tables, 7app.
tables.
ABSTRACT
Sixexploratory fishing cruises, totaling 122oper-
ating days, weremade bytheresearch vessel Kaho
fromNovember 1963 toOctober 1965. Most ofthe
exploratory operations were inthecentral and
eastern portions ofthe lake; however, limited
surveys weremade inthewestern area during
1965. This study isthe firstattempt toassess the
potential forcommercial bottom trawling inLake
Superior.
Suitable bottom fortrawling wasfound along
about 65percent ofthesouth shore. Over 74percent
ofthetotal catch bytheKaho werechubs (Leucich-
thys spp.) followed byAmerican smelt (Osmervs
mordax), 10percent; suckers (Catostomus spp.),
6.5percent; andlaketrout (Salveliniisnamaycush),
3percent. Commercially significant catches, 250
pounds perone-half hour, ofchubs were taken on
every cruise andthese fish,even ifusedmainly for
animal food products, could apparently support a
limited trawl fishery. Smelt, suckers, andcommon
whiteflsh (Coregonus chipeaformis) were caught
occasionally incommercially significant quantities
and could greatly supplement production efforts.
Most lake trout were caught inspecific geographic
areas andappeared tobesegregated bysize in
specific depth zones. Abundant concentrations of
small trout could easily beavoided after being lo-
cated byfishing certain depths. With proper care,
most trout were returned tothewater alive. The
alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) ,which isnow the
basis ofagrowing trawl fishery inLake Michigan,
and lake herring (Leucichthys artedt) were not
taken insignificant amounts during thestudy.

ofLake Michigan, 1963-65. ByNorman J.
Reigle, Jr.March 1969, 14pp.,3figs., 6tables,
2app. tables.
ABSTRACT
Abottom trawling survey wasmade during 11
cruises operating for36days over the3-year study
period. Explorations weremade atallpossible
fishing depths andduring 8months. The179ex-
ploratory drags made during thisstudy represent
the first attempts bytheBureau ofCommercial
Fisheries todetermine ifbottom trawling inGreen
Bay iscommercially feasible.
The overall catch ratewasatalevel thatwould
becommercially feasible foratrawl fishery based
primarily onalewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and
smelt (Osmerus mordax) andsupplemented by
catches ofsuckers (Catostomus catostomus and C.
commersoni), carp (Cyprinus carpio), andyellow
perch (Perca flavescens) .Game fishwere taken
infrequently inthetrawl, andtrawling would not
jeopardize sport fishing inGreen Bay.

Lake Michigan, 1962-65. ByNorman J.Reigle, Jr.February 1969, 35pp.,6figs., 13
tables, 11app. tables.
ABSTRACT
For 4years theBureau ofCommercial Fisheries
Exploratory Fishing andGear Research Base at
AnnArbor, Mich., surveyed theabundance, seasonal
availability, anddepth distribution ofvarious fish
stocks.
Thealewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) andchubs
(Leucichthys spp.) were taken readily with the
bottom trawl. Alewives composed 51.4percent and
chubs 44.0percent ofthetrawl catch. Two other
commercial species, yellow perch (Perca flavescens)
andsmelt (Osmerus mordax), were taken occasion-
ally incommercial amounts.
Thealewife stocks have increased tremendously
inrecent years. Thepoundage ofalewives inthe
trawl catch increased each yearfrom 17percent
in1962 to74percent in1965. Alewives exhibited
pronounced seasonal movements andgenerally were
available tobottom trawls only atspecific depths.
Thetrawls caught alewives atdepths oflessthan
5fathoms toover 50fathoms. Alewives appeared
tobedistributed universally inthestudy areaduring
most oftheyearbutwerefound only insome sections
inwinter. Alewves were more diflncult tocatch
between JulyandtheendofDecember thanduring
January through June.
Chubs wereabundant allyearthroughout south-
ernLake Michigan. Chubs werecaught overawide
depth range throughout theyear, although bottom
trawling indicated some horizontal dispersal shore-
ward insummer andback todeeper water infall.

310. Japanese, Soviet, andSouth Korean fish-
eries offAlaska. Development andhistory
throug-h 1966. ByPhilip E.Chitwood. Jan-
uary 1969, 34pp.,19figs., 8tables.
ABSTRACT
The history offisheries offAlaska byanation
from across thePacific Ocean dates back to1930.
Inthat yearJapan dispatched aking crab expe-
dition intotheeastern Bering Sea. Japanese ex-
ploitation oftheeastern Bering Seafishery resources
wasexpanded in1933when agroundfish fishery was
initialed. By1941, Japan's fisheries intheeastern
Bering Seahadbeen halted because theImperial
Navy hadrequisitioned most ofJapan's vessels for
useinWorld War II.
In1952, after alapse of11years, Japanese fishing
off.\laska resumed. Inthatyear theJapanese be-
gan fishing forsalmon along thewestern Aleutian
Islands. In1953, theyresumed theirprewar fish-
eries intheeastern Bering Sea.
TheJapanese fleets offAlaska were joined in1959
byU.S.S.R. fleets, which began fishing flounder and
king crab intheeastern Bering Seaandwhaling
along theAleutian Islands.
During theearly 1960's, both theJapanese and
theSoviets accelerated their exploitation ofthefish-
eryresources offAlaska, working newgrounds and
taking additional species. Bytheclose of1966,
fisheries ofthese twonations engulfed nearly all
the550,000 square nautical miles oftheContinental
Shelf offAlaska. Their fleets ranged from Dixon
Entrance inthesouth and east, tobeyond Attu
Island inthewest, andintotheArctic Ocean inthe
north. Also in1966, another Asian nation, South
Korea, made preparations toenter thefisheries oflf
Alaska.
311. Billfishes oftheCentral Pacific Ocean.
ByDonald W.Strasburg. April 1969, 11pp.,
7figs.
ABSTRACT
The billfishes arefound inallwarm seas. Inthe
central Pacific, thestriped and blue marlins are
common orabundant; theblack marlin isuncom-
mon; thePacific sailfish, broadbill swordfish, and
shortbill spearfish arerarely caught. These fishes
feedbroadly onfish, squid, crustaceans, andother
foods available onthehigh seas. Incommercial
catches ofbluemarlin inHawaii, males andfemales
appear inabout equal numbers; butonashort-
term basis, onesexcanpredominate. During the
Hawaiian International Billfish Tournaments, which
areheldduring thesummer, more males areusually
caught than females. Inthecommercial catch,
theheaviest blue marlin (300-500 pounds) were
taken inthespring, thelightest inthesummer.
Striped marlin show twopeaks ofabundance
through part oftheyear. Blue marlin aremost
abundant inthesummer. Striped marlin tend tooccur inlarge numbers justwhen thebluemarlin
areleast abundant. Thelongest migration recorded
inthecentral Pacific was3,000 miles, byastriped
marlin thatwastagged offBaja California, Mexico,
later caught near theHawaiian Islands.

ABSTRACT
Themajor goals oftheLaboratory aretoexplore
therelatively unknown scope ofbiological produc-
tivity inthecoastal zone oftheeastern Gulf of
Mexico, tomeasure theeffect ofchanges inthat
zone,and todevelop methods ofincreasing estuarine
fishery resources. The report describes current
research onprojects intheEstuarine, Red-Tide,
andIndustrial Schoolfishes Programs. Theprojects
include studies ofsediments andorganisms inbay
bottoms, plankton crops and fishes residing inand
transferring between estuaries andtheGulf ofMex-
ico,toxicity ofthered-tide organism, andexper-
imental rearing ofpompano inanimpounded lagoon.

ABSTRACT
Over aperiod of3years theBureau ofCommer-
cial Fisheries Exploratory Fishing Base atAnn
Arbor, Mich., surveyed therelative abundance, depth
distribution, andseasonal availability ofvarious fish
stocks thatwere fished withbottom trawls.
The alewife, Alosa pseudoharengus, andchubs,
Leucichthys spp.,were taken readily with thebot-
tomtrawl. Alewives composed 48percent andchubs
42percent ofthetotal trawl catch. Three other
fish—smelt, Osmerus mordox, suckers, Catostormis
conimersoni andC.catostomus, andcommon white-
fish,Coregonus clupeaformis —were taken occasion-
ally incommercial amounts.
Alewives have very pronounced seasonal move-
ments, andatcertain times oftheyearbottom trawls
catch them only atspecific depths. Bottom trawls
didnottakealewives incommercial amounts during
allperiods fished; there isevidence that alewives
would beavailable commercially only incertain
seasons. Chubs werecaught readily throughout the
study, although they tooappeared tobetaken in
greater quantities atcertain times. Bottom trawling
indicated some horizontal dispersal ofboth alewife
andchubs shoreward insummer andback todeeper
water infall. Chubs arecaught over awide depth
range throughout theyear.

ABSTRACT
Primary emphasis oftheresearch wason(1)
salmon (genus Oncorhynchus) intheNorth Pacific
Ocean and theColumbia River Basin and (2)
groundfish ontheContinental Shelf ofthePacific
Northwest. Considerable progress wasmade to-
ward showing how thedistribution ofsalmon is
related totheocean environment. Biochemical tech-
niques showed promise inpinpointing genetic and
geographic differences instocks offish.Togather
thedata needed formanaging thesalmon stocks,
integrated studies weremade ofocean growth, mor-
tality, maturation, and effects ofgear onsalmon.
Research intheColumbia River Basin provided new
information onhowdams and reservoirs affect
salmon and steelhead trout (Salmo gairdneri);
studies weremade tomeasure and todevelop ways
tocounteract thelosses offish. Groundfish researchdisclosed differences inPacific hake (Merlucmis
prodiictus) stocks ofPuget Sound andtheConti-
nental Shelf. Publications and staff ofthelabora-
toryare listed.

ABSTRACT
EDTA, aquality stabilizing additive, isusually
applied toseafoods byspraying ordipping, andthe
amount ofEDTA retained bythetreated product
must bedetermined byananalytical method. A
titration method based onthechelation ofEDTA
with thorium ionwasmodified foruse inthede-
termination ofEDTA infish fleshandcrab meat.
Themodified method isboth simple andrapid and
gave about 90-percent recovery ofaddedEDTA

ABSTRACT
Thesystem wasdesigned andconstructed sothat
thefeasibility ofusing electricity tohelp capture

determined. Components ofthesystem were de-
signed toproduce, onafull-size commercial trawl,
thestimulation needed tocause shrimp toemerge
from thesubstratum where theyburrow during the

Infishing trials oflfthecoasts ofMississippi and
Texas, theprototype electric trawl caught during
daylight 95and109percent ofthequantity ofshrimp
caught atnight byaconventional, nonelectric trawl.
IntheDryTortugas area offSouthern Florida,
where thesubstratum iscalcareous sand-shell rather
thanmud asinthesubstratum oftheNorthern Gulf

ABSTRACT
Although organoleptic panels lack precision, they
aretheonlyinstrument that, atpresent, can inte-
grate allthefactors that affect quality. Described
here isanewapproach toimproving panel precision.
Using theapproach, apanel expresses quality in
terms oftheestimated storage time ofthesample
rather than insuchambiguous terms as"excellent,"
"very good," and"borderline." Theapproach ob-
viates theneed forarbitrary terms todescribe qual-
ityand assists thepanelists inmaking hisevalu-
ations objectively. Statistical analysis ofthere-
sults obtained when apanel used themethod on
samples offresh cod fillets indicates thatthestorageageofsuch samples canbeestimated towithin
±2.2 days with areliability of95percent.

and B.
ABSTRACT
A5-year study ofthedemersal fishresources of
theContinental Shelf offSoutheastern United
States resulted intheoccupation of956exploratory
trawling stations inthe 6-to100-fathom depth
range. Thestudy showed that theregion canbe
divided into fivegeneral habitat types—coastal,
open-shelf, live-bottom, shelf-edge, andlower-shelf—each harboring adistinctive association ofde-
mersal fishes.
The coastal habitat, which hasasmooth, sandy-
mudbottom out todepths of8to10fathoms, has
well-known andabundant resources ofbottomfishes.
Increased useofthese stocks (mostly drums and
croakers) seems todepend onmarket development,
rather than onadditional exploratory fishing.
Theopen-shelf habitat, which hasasmooth sand
bottom todepths ofabout 10to25or30fathoms,
haspoor potential foratrawl fishery forfood fishes.
Occasional large catches ofscupand filefish indi-
cate, however, that these species may beabundant
enough tosupport asmall industrial fishery for
bottomfish.
Thelive-bottom habitats, which aresmall areas
ofbroken relief andarich sessile invertebrate fauna
within theopen-shelf habitat, have thebest food-
fish potential forcommercial utilization. During
exploratory fishing, moderate tolarge catches of
snappers, groupers, porgies, andecologically asso-
ciated species were taken consistently withNew
England-type otter trawls. Thebestareas were off
Northeastern Florida andSouth Carolina, butother
productive areas were found along most ofthe
Southeastern Coast.
The shelf-edge habitat, which hasasmooth to
highly broken bottom andruns along theedge of
theContinental Shelf atdepths ofabout 30to60
fathoms, alsohaslarge concentrations ofsnappers,
groupers, andporgies incertain localities. Although
trawling wasoften impractical intherougher por-
tions ofthishabitat, thefishery resources ofthese
areas canbeharvested byhandlines andtraps.
Thelower-shelf habitat hasasmooth mudbottom
from about 60toatleast 100fathoms; thelimited
explorations indicate thepresence oflarge concen-
trations ofbutterfish, spotted hake, andperhaps
groupers inthis habitat.
Afishing logand chart of50stations where
catches ofcommercial sizeweremade isprovided.
Alistofdemersal fishes taken during theexplora-
tions isgiven, along with notations ontheir occur-
rences inthetrawl catches andhabitat occupation.

tables.
ABSTRACT
Agreen coloration hasappeared sporadically on
frozen rawbreaded shrimp. Reported here arethe
results ofastudy made todetermine thecause of
thegreen coloration andtofindamethod ofavoiding
it.Thestudy indicates that thecoloration was
caused byairborne metallic particles andthat elim-
inating theparticles from contact with theproduct
would therefore solve theproblem.

May 1969, pp.17-24. 7figs., 1table.
ABSTRACT
Fresh Dungeness crabmeat, owing toitsrelatively
shortandvariable shelf life, isordinarily restricted
tosale close toitsarea ofproduction. Tofinda
basis forwidening thearea ofsale,wedetermined
theshelf lifeforDungeness crabmeat irradiated
inrvholesale containers, stored 12or20days at
3S°F., andsubsequently repacked into retail con-
tainers andagain stored at33°F.Therepacked
samples hadadequate shelf lifeformarketing in
retail stores. Thus, irradiation ofDungeness crab
meat inwholesale containers would permit this
product tobewidely distributed inretail stores.

ABSTRACT
Data areneeded ontheproximate composition
oftropical andsemitropical fishes. Thispaper re-ports, onayear-round basis, theproportions ofpro-
tein, oil,ash,andwater in10commercial species
offishes from theEastern Mediterranean Seaand
theSouthern Red Sea. Allspecies were high in
protein. Thedemersal fishes were lowinoil,where-
asthepelagic fishes were relatively high. Large
changes intheconcentration ofoilobserved inthe
pelagic fishes wereprobably related tothespawning
cycle.

ABSTRACT
Bothmarine algae andfresh-water algaemayhelp
tosolve theproblem ofworld hunger. Ofthese two
groups, thefresh-water algae show thegreater
promise; andofthefresh-water algae—bluegreen
andgreen—thegreen algae show thegreater
promise. Accordingly, thisreport centers largely
ongreen algae (Chlorella inparticular) and dis-
cusses both their artificial production and nutri-
tional value. Byasuitable manipulation ofvar-
iables, green algae containing asmuch as50percent
ormore protein, onadry-weight basis, canbeman-
ufactured continuously onalarge scale.

tocontrol fishshrinkage during hot-smoking,
byHarold J.Barnett, Richard W.Nelson, and

3tables.
ABSTRACT
Loss ofmoisture inthehot-smoking (kippering)
ofthawed halibut, salmon, andblack codresults in
aneconomic lossaswell asinaloss ofquality.
Because sodium tripolyphosphate effectively reduces
lossofmoisture inother foods, including fresh fish, it
was tried with these smoked products. Useofthis
substance effectivelv aided theretention ofmoisture
inhalibut andsalmon during smoking butwas less
effective inaiding theretention ofmoisture inblack
cod.
Vol. 5,No. 3.Useofelectron paramagnetism
inresearch onfish lipids, byWilliam T.
Roubal. August 1969, pp.107-115, 3figs.
ABSTRACT
Theproducts oflipid oxidation cause undesirable
alterations, notonly inlipids themselves, butalso
inthequality ofassociated proteins, enzymes, and
other biomolecules. Fundamental studies ofoxidiz-
inglipids inbiochemical systems areneeded ifthese
undesirable changes aretobeminimized.
Measuring theparamagnetic properties ofthese
systems hasgreat potential forelucidating themech-
anism oftheundesirable changes andthereby giving
usapossible way offinding how tocontrol them.
Unfortunately, thistechnique ofmeasurement isnot
widely understood.
Thispaper explains thetechnique andgives ex-
amples ofhow themeasurement ofparamagnetic
properties canbeapplied inresearch related tofish
lipids, particularly intherelation offree-radicals
totheloss ofnutritive value and inthestudy of
antioxidant functions.
Vol. 5,No. 3.Evaluation ofmuscle hypoxan-
thine and volatile bases aspotential quality
indices forindustrial bottomfishes from the
Gulf ofMexico, byEnrique J.Guardia and
Gerhard J.Haas. August 1969, pp.117-120,
4figs.
ABSTRACT
Croaker andspotarethetwospecies found most
commonly incatches ofindustrial bottomfishes in
theGulf ofMexico. Hypoxanthine increased lin-
early inboth species during the first 2weeks that
these fishes were stored inice. This testforhy-
poxanthine could thus indicate thequality ofboth
croaker andspotandpresumably that ofthewhole
catch. Only after the fishhadbeen stored 1week
inice,however, didthetotal volatile bases increase.
Consequently, this latter testcould notbeused as
anindex offreshness, although itmight beused
asanindex ofspoilage.

Thequestion hasarisen astothepotential andcom-
parative value ofking crabmeal inbroiler diets.
Accordingly, king crab meal andblue crab meal
(anestablished product) were evaluated astotheir

ABSTRACT
Incans that contained haddock fillets andthat
were (1)hei-metically sealed atatmospheric pres-
sure, (2)radiopasteurized, and (3)stored atabout
0.5°C,the level ofoxygen dropped from about
21percent toabout 2percent within 30days, at
which time thepercentage ofoxygen was stillfalling.
This decrease intheconcentration ofoxygen indi-
cates that theatmospheric environment within the
canswasconducive tothegrowth ofaerobes, micro-
aerophiles, facultative anaerobes, oranaerobes at
various stages ofoxygen depletion during the
storage.

Vol. 5,No. 4.Effect ofvarying theextraction
procedure ontheprotein extractability offro-
zen-stored fishmuscle, byElinor M.Ravesi
andMargaret L.Anderson. October 1969,
pp.175-180, 2tables.
ABSTRACT
Theamount ofextractable protein infrozen-
stored fishmuscle isoften used asacriterion of
itstextural quality. Anassessment ofthetexture
offishmuscle byanorganoleptic testpanel, how-
ever, often shows poor correlation with theamount
ofprotein that isextracted from themuscle.
Because wehypothesized that theamount ofpro-
teinthatcanbeextracted from frozen fishmuscle
depends, inlarge part, upon thetechnique ofex-
traction used,westudied the eflfects ofvarying the
solubility-test procedure, using one lotoffrozen-
stored codmuscle. Depending onthelength oftime
that thesample wasblended andtheconcentration
oftheneutral-salt extractant used, theamount of
extractable protein varied between (1)values con-
sidered torepresent minimum extractability infro-
zencodmuscle thathasundergone extensive text-
ural deterioration and (2)values considered tobe
typical ofrecently frozen cod.
These contradictory results indicate aneed for
standardizing theextraction procedure. Webelieve
thatsuch standardization willminimize thelack of
correlation nowfound intheliterature between the
content ofsoluble protein andtheextent that the
texture offrozen fishmuscle hasdeteriorated as
evaluated organoleptically.

ABSTRACT
For theimprovement ofthequality ofcanned
pink shrimp, particularly itscolor, aprocess is
needed sothat fresh shrimp, rather than aged
shrimp, canbepeeled bymachine.
Inourwork onthisproblem, theretention ofcolor
wasimproved during peeling iftheshrimp were
first given aheat pretreatment. During in-plant
trials, 60-to500-pound lotsofshrimp were given
various one-stage andtwo-stage heat treatmentsTheprecook method ofpreparing fresh shrimp
forpeeling bymachine resulted inacanned product
thathadmore color andhad better texture and
flavor than shrimp prepared forpeeling bybeing
held iniceorinrefrigerated seawater. Insome
samples, gelling occurred intheliquor, andsome
canshadmore sulfide blackening than usual,
before they were machine peeled and routinely
canned.

ABSTRACT
Little information isavailable onthedepth ofa
pur.se seine atdifferent times during setting, though
thetiming ofsetting andpursing isimportant in
thedevelopment ofsuccessful fishing tactics. The
depth-time relation during setting was studied for
twotuna purse seines ofdifferent size (7strips
deep, 470fathoms long; 8strips deep, 520fathoms
long) towhich depth-time recorders were attached.
From data gathered during 32sets, composite se-
quence analyses andunderwater netprofiles were
prepared forfour basic stages (halfway through
setting, endofsetting, start ofpursing, andhalf-
waythrough pursing) ofthesetting andpursing
operations.
Vol. 5,No. 5.Recommendations forimproving
thequality ofvessel-caught groundfish, byJ.
Perry Lane. December 1969, pp.203-213,
9figs.
ABSTRACT
Because fishstart tolose their quality assoon
asthey aretaken from theseaandbecause the
basic causes oftheloss inquality arenotreadily
observable totheeye,fishermen need guidelines for
slowing therate atwhich thequality ofthe fish
islost.
Recommended here aresuggestions that willen-
ablefishermen toslowtherateofquality loss.These
recommendations provide guidelines that arede-
signed (1)toreduce theinitial numbers ofbacteria
onnewly caught fish, (2)toprevent the fishfrom
being crushed andotherwise physically damaged,
(3) toprotect the fishfrom being contaminated
bybacteria from such sources aspughs, hand con-
tact,andviscera, (4)toretard theactivity ofbac-
teria andenzymes byrapid andsustained chilling
ofthe fish,and (5)toprotect the fishfrom con-
tamination from such sources asfuel oilandsour
bilges.
Putting these recommendations intousewill in-
crease thedemand forgroundfish, willmake ground-
fishing more profitable, and will help theU.S.
groundfishing industry tomeet foreign competition.

619. Alaska's fishery resources—The pink
salmon. ByJack E.Bailey. March 1969, iv
-I-8pp.,5fig's., 2tables.
ABSTRACT
Pink salmon, Oncorhynchus gorbuscha, alsocalled
humpback salmon, arethemost abundant ofthe
Pacific salmon inAlaska. Alaska production ofpink
salmon hasanaverage wholesale value of$28million
andconstitutes more than half ofthetotalNorth
American catch. Female pinksalmon carry about
2,000 eggs eachandspawn inlatesummer orearly
fall.Theresulting fryemerge thefollowing spring
andmigrate directly tosaltwater. They spend 1
year atseaandreturn as2-year-olds tospawn and
die intheir native stream. Alaskan pinksalmon
usually spawn onlyashort distance from thesea;
many evenspawn inintertidal streambeds. Fewer
than 25percent oftheyoung survive from thetime
ofspawning until thetime ofemergence from the
gravel. Similar lowsurvival rates prevail during
theestuarine andoceanic portions ofthe lifecycle.
Pink salmon arejustover 1inch longwhen they
enter thesea,buttheygrow toanaverage length
ofabout 20inches andweigh about 4pounds as
adults. Research biologists ofseveral agencies
assist fishery managers bydetermining themigra-
tionpaths andthefactors that affect abundance of
pink salmon.

ABSTRACT
Thecatch ofsalmon andsteelhead trout from fish
reared inProgram hatcheries increased rapidly be-
ginning in1964.By1967 thebenefits from operation
ofthese hatcheries appeared tobewell inexcess of
their costs. TheOregon moist pellet dietwasthegreatest single factor inproviding aneconomically
favorable operation.
Further advances inhatchery efficiency areex-

ABSTRACT
Differences innumbers ofcirculi andlengths of
radii through the first freshwater annulus were
used totestthehypothesis that theriver oforigin
could bedetermined from these characteristics.
.\naly.ses indicated thatmales andfemales and dif-
ferent agegroups ofabrood year could becombined
foreach river, butthatcomparisons between rivers
should berestricted tocommon brood years.. Al-
though average counts ofcirculi andaverage lengths
ofradiiwere different insamples from each river,
thevariability inthese characteristics isgreat, and
neither characteristic isclearly diagnostic forthe
stock inanyoftherivers.

ABSTRACT
Temperature and salinity datawere collected in
1958-66, and dissolved oxygen, dissolved organic
nitrogen, and totalphosphorus analyses weremade
onsamples collected in1964-66 inClear Lake, a
small estuary that flows intoupper Galveston Bay.
Seasonal trends inbottom water temperature
11
were similar inthedifferent years andwere related
closely totrends inairtemperature. Average water
temperatures were lowest (about 13°C.) inJan-
uary andFebruary andhighest (about 31°C.)in
July. Therateofwarming andcooling wasdirectly
related tothemagnitude oftheannual temperature
difference between thewarm and coolmonths.

ABSTRACT
Ovaries wereexamined from 537 fishcollected in
theeastern tropical Atlantic, western tropical At-
lantic, and offNew York. Thereported incidence
oflarval andjuvenile K.pelamis wasalsoreviewed.
Theminimum fork length ofskipjack tuna atma-
turity was435mm. intheeastern tropical Atlantic,
and410mm. inthewestern tropical Atlantic. All
ovaries collected offNewYork were inanearly
stage ofdevelopment. Thepercentage ofskipjack
tunanearspawning orrecently spawned wasgreater
inthewestern tropical Atlantic than intheeastern
tropical Atlantic. Skipjack tunaspawn throughout

February 1969, iii+14pp.,8figs., 4tables.
ABSTRACT
Electricity wasused e.xperimentally todivert and
trap squawfish during their spawning migration
in1958 atCascade Reservoir, Idaho. Electrical
fields, created bysequentially energizing aV-shaped
array ofvertically suspended round electrodes with
square-wave, d.c.pulses, were evaluated asameans
ofdiverting squawfish into traps.
Three testconditions ofvaried pulse frequency,
pulse duration, andvoltage were tested. Two sets
hadapulse frequency of10pulses persecond (2per
field persecond when five fields were pulsed inse-
quence), apulse duration of50msec, andvoltages
of140and180 v.;onesethadapulse frequency of
15pulses persecond (3perfield), apulse duration
of25msec, andavoltage of180v.One set(pul.se
frequency, 10pulses persecond; pulse duration,
50msec; andvoltage, 180v.)wasrepeated.
The electrical fields oftheelectrode array were
effective indiverting squawfish intotraps. The test
condition with pulse frequency of15pulses persec-
ond,pulse duration of25msec, andvoltage of180v.
was lesseffective than theother testconditions.

ABSTRACT
In1966, 52,497 maleand391female furseals
(Callorhinus insinus) were killed onthePribilof
Islands.
Counts ofdead furseals included 27,392 pups,
222adult males, and227adult females.
Malnutrition, hookworm disease, infections, and
bitewounds were themajor causes ofdeath of164
pups examined in1966.
OnthePribilof Islands 9,948 harem and 6,856
idlemales were counted in1966.
Ofthe514-year-old females examined, onewas
primiparous andpostpartum; none ofthe653-
year-old females hadbeen gravid.
Handling apparently causes pups toloseweight
orslows their rate ofweight gain.
12
Atotal of12,499 pups were tagged andcheck-
marked and12,077 were marked. Two tagswere
attached to2,978 males older thanpups onSt.Paul
Island. Recoveries ofsealsmarked inprevious years
included 4,418marked aspupsand159marked at
age 1orolder onthePribilof Islands, and30seals
marked aspups ontheSoviet Islands.
Pups tagged inlateSeptember apparently survive
theeffects oftagging better than pups tagged in
mid-August. Onthebasis oftagrecoveries, the
estimated number ofpups born decreased steadily
from 643,000 in1960 to440,000 in1964. The esti-
mate ofpupsborn in1966frommarked-to-unmarked
ratios was 380,000. Estimates from marked-to-un-
marked ratios were similar tototal counts ofpups
onthree rookeries.
Anestimated 78,000 males from each oftwo
year classes (1961 and1962) survived toage 1.
The forecasted killof3-and4-year oldmale
seals onSt.Paul Island in1966was 40,000; the
actual killwas 37,669. Theforcasted killofmales
onthePribilof Islands in1967 includes 4,000 of
ages 2and 5,34,300 ofage 3,and17,900 ofage 4.
The249adult males killed forstudy andthe157
adult males found deadhadsimilar agedistributions.
Theannual replacement rate formales age10and
older isestimated aas 0.38.
Si.\ty-six genital tracts from adult females
were collected from 13September to28November.
The first of17tracts with implantation chambers
was collected 4November; all5tracts taken on28
November hadimplantation chambers.
Inatest todetermine accuracy inassigning the
correct ages tofursealsfrom canine teeth, thelowest
errors were 2.5to3.9percent formales inages
2to5and 3.8to21.3percent forfemales inages
3to7.Japanese andU.S. readers disagreed on
18.2percent ofmales inages 1to4and 36.5 per-
cent offemales inages 1to7intwoother groups
ofteeth.
Succinylcholine apparently isunsafe foruse in
immobilizing adult male fur seals.
Sealpups gained more weight when fedcalcium
caseinate and fish flour thanwhen fed fish flour
alone. Colostrum milk obtained immediately post
partum hasmuch higher levels ofalbumin and
globulin than doesmilk oflater lactation.
Pelagic research wasconducted offcentral and
southern California from 21January to25March
1966. Seal distribution wasstudied along transects
extending 19to222km.offshore between lat.32°N.
and38°N.at37-km. intervals. Seals were usually
found 37to130km. offshore. Thelargest concen-
trations ofseals were usually near areas where
abrupt changes indepths occur along theContinental
Shelf andover seavalleys andseamounts.
Of2,704 seals sighted, 444were collected, 78were
wounded and lost,and67sank after theywere killed.
Males formed only asmall part ofthepopulation.
Of428females taken, 52percent were gravid; the
youngest gravid female wasaprimiparous 4-year-
old.Alanternfish (Myctophum calif ornierise) ,a
.sciaenid (species unknown), andasquid {Chiroteii-
this i-eraiiyi) were found infursealstomachs for
the first time. Northern anchovy (Engraulis mor-
dax) ,Pacific saury (Cololahis saira) ,Pacific hake
(Merluccius productus) ,andsquids were theprin-
cipal food species offurseals offCalifornia.

ABSTRACT
Thereturn ofadult pink salmon, Oveorhyvchus
gorbuscha, toSashin Creek wasvery low inthe
even years from 1946 to1962. In1964anexper-
iment tested amethod oftransplanting adults tore-
establish theeven-year runofpink salmon.
About 2,400 adult pinksalmon were captured in
apurse seine inBearHarbor andtransported alive
inbrine tanks onaboat toSashin Creek, adistance
ofabout 80km. (50miles). Most ofthefishsur-
vived thetrip; 727males and 1,139 females were
putintoSashin Creek above aweir. The trans-
planted fishwere augmented by166females and
121males ofunknown origin thatentered thestream
naturally.
The distribution ofthespawners inthestream
wassimilar tothat ofnative runs ofthesame size.
Survival oftheeggsandprogeny from apotential
deposition of2,230,000 eggswas relatively good for
Sashin Creek—55percent totheendofspawning
and14percent tofryemergence thenext spring.
Thesurvival ofthese fishintheocean wasalso rel-
atively good, andabout 6,000 adults (2percent
ofthefry) returned tospawn in1966. These fish
spawned successfully, andsurvival offry in1967
from thepotential eggdeposition was12percent.

filial generation oftransplanted pinksalmon,
andsurvival oftheir progeny, Sashin Creek,

October 1969, iii+13pp.,5figs., 10tables.
ABSTRACT
Escapement ofadult pinksalmon toSashin Creek
in1966was 5,761 fish—mostly progeny of1,866
adults transplanted tothestream in1964. The
adults entered Sashin Creek relatively early inthe
season andwithin ashort period oftime. Most of
them spawned inthesame twostudy sections of
Sashin Creek ("Lower" and"Middle") usedbytheir
parents andbyearlier native runs ofsimilar size.
Thetwosections hadnearly equal densities offe-
males (about 0.27persquare meter) andpotential
eggdeposition (about 570eggs persquare meter)
butdiff'erent efficiencies ofeggdeposition (about 47
percent intheMiddle section and28percent inthe
Lower). Thelowaverage efficiency fortheentire
stream (37percent) wasprobably duetothehigh
streamflow during thespawning season. Thepro-
portion ofcombined eggsandalevins alive inMarch
wasnearly equal intheMiddle andLower sections
(63and65percent), butthedisappearance from
theendofspawning tojustbefore emergence was
markedly different—about 80percent fortheMiddle
section and47percent fortheLower. Total sur-
vival from potential eggdeposition topreemergent
frywas 9percent intheMiddle section and15per-
cent intheLower.
Estimated number ofpinksalmon fryproduced
inSashin Creek inthespring of1967was 750,000,
or12percent ofthepotential egg deposition of
6,255,000. This isthesurvival predicted from the
historical relation oftotal fresh-water survival to
thedate half thespawners entered thestream.
Several lines ofcircumstantial evidence indicate
that theadult pinksalmon thatspawned inSashinCreek in1966weremostly progeny ofthefishtrans-
planted tothestream in1964.

Katmai National Monument, Alaska, andtheir
zoogeographical implications, byWilliam R.
Heard, Richard L.Wallace, andWilbur L.
Hartman. October 1969, iii+20pp.,2figs.,
3tables.
ABSTRACT
Katmai National Monument covers 10,916 km.-
onthebase ofthe.Alaska Peninsula and isdivided
bytheAleutian Mountain Range intotwoprincipal
drainage areas. Streams north oftheAleutian
Range flow into Bristol BayoftheBering Sea,and
those south ofthemountains flow into Shelikof
Strait oftheNorth Pacific Ocean. Thelarge multi-
lakeNaknek River system isthedominant drainage
areaontheBristol Baysideofthemonument, where-
assmall single lakes andshort streams andrivers
constitute many separate drainages ontheShelikof
Strait side. Twenty-four species offishoccur in
theBristol Baydrainages ofthemonument, butonly
eight species were collected instreams andlakes
draining intoShelikof Strait. Evidently theAleu-
tianRange hasbeen abarrier tothesouthward
movement offreshwater fishes inthemonument.
Alleight species inShelikof Strait drainages are
capable ofdispersal through saltwater, whereas
several forms inBristol Baydrainages require fresh
water fordispersal. Variable numbers ofspecies
occur intheinterconnecting lakes oftheNaknek
River system. Naknek Lake, thedownstream term-
inus ofthelake system, contains 24known species
andeachupstream lakecontains fewer species than
theoneintowhich itdrains. Thepresent distribu-
tion offishes inthissystem isdiscussed interms
ofthesequential timing ofspecies invasion andthe
postglacial development ofbarriers.

ABSTRACT
Published andunpublished reports arereviewed
andmethods used toevaluate thedata arediscussed.
Adescription ispresented ofthefood ofseven At-
lantic tunas ofcommercial importance, little tuna
{Euthynrnis alletteratus) ,skipjack tuna (Katsu-
wonus pelamis),yellowfin tuna(Thunnus albacar-
es) ,blackfin tuna {T.atlanticus) ,thebluefin tuna
complex {T.thyiiims thymius andT.maccoyii) ,big-
eyetuna (T.obesus) ,andalbacore (T.alalunga).
Their food consists mainly ofpelagic fish(mostly
juveniles, some larvae and adults), crustaceans
(mostly macrozooplankton) ,andmolusks (chiefly
cephalopods). Thegreatest number offood items
14
are fishtaxa (331), followed bycrustaceans (111)
andmollusks (74). Prey organisms arelisted al-
phabetically, according tothetuna species. The
foodconsumed bythespecies oftunawasgenerally
similar. Differences infoodbetween thejuvenile
andadult bluefin tunawere pronounced; juveniles
fedlargely oncrustaceans whereas adults fedpri-
marily onfishes. Seasonal differences were noted
inthecomposition ofthefood ofskipjack and yel-
lowfin tunas inAfrican waters.

ABSTRACT
Thefishery fornorthern lobsters, Homarus amer-
icanus, intheoffshore waters oftheNorth Atlantic
isdeveloping rapidly and isexpected toalter certain
lobsters have been taken during research cruises
andfrom commercial catches todocument theex-
isting sizecomposition, sexratio, and sizeatma-
turity. These records willprovide useful indices
ofpopulation changes asfishing effort increases.
Thedata inthisreport arefrom fiveofthemajor
fishing areas—Hudson, Veatch, Oceanographer,
Lydonia, andCorsair Canyons. Lobsters from can-
yons 200km.from shore were substantially smaller
than those from areas farther offshore. The size
oflobsters generally increased with depth andthe
proportion offemales generally increased with in-
creasing size. Females dominated thesamples and
sometimes were 70percent ofthecatch. Thenum-
bers ofegg-bearing females arereported. The
smallest female with external eggswas 8.0cm. in
carapace length.
