Abstract
A discrete-bubble model that predicts the rate of oxygen transfer in diffused-bubble systems is evaluated. Key inputs
are the applied gas ﬂow rate and the initial bubble size distribution. The model accounts for changes in the volume of
individual bubbles due to transfer of oxygen and nitrogen (and hence changing partial pressure), variation inhydrostatic pressure, and changes in temperature. The bubble-rise velocity and mass-transfer coefﬁcient, both known
functionsofthebubblediameter,arecontinuallyadjusted.Themodelisappliedtopredicttheresultsofdiffused-bubble
oxygen transfer tests conducted in a 14-m deep tank at three air ﬂow rates. All of the test data are predicted to within15%. The rangeof bubble diameters (0.2–2mm) spans the region of greatest variation in rise velocityandmass-transfer
coefﬁcient. For simplicity, the Sauter-mean diameter is used rather than the full bubble size distribution without loss of
accuracy.Themodelshouldproveusefulinthedesignandoptimizationofhypolimneticoxygenationsystems,aswellasother diffused-bubble applications. r2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Thermal stratiﬁcation of reservoirs mayresult in
substantial hypolimnetic oxygen depletion. Low dis-
solved oxygen (DO) levels have a negative impact oncold-water ﬁsheries, hydropower discharges, and the
drinking-water treatment process. In water-supply
reservoirs, low DO maylead to the production ofhydrogen sulﬁde andammonia andcan causethe release
of soluble reduced iron and manganese from the
sediments. Iron, manganese, and hydrogen sulﬁdeimpart undesirable color, taste, and odor to the water
requiring additional treatment prior to distribution
[1]. The increased oxidant demand at the watertreatment plant increases costs and, if organic matterispresent,mayincrease theconcentrationofdisinfection
byproducts.
In the case of hydropower reservoirs, the US Federal
EnergyRegulatoryCommission ty picallyrequires thatreleases meet local in-stream water-qualitystandards [2]
with minimum DO levels of about 5gm
/C03.A sa
consequence, hydropower operators must frequently
add large quantities of oxygen to stored water prior to
or during discharge. For example, the Tennessee ValleyAuthority(TVA) spends about $2M annuallyon
liquid oxygen that is added to several of their hydro-
power reservoirs [3]. Hypolimnetic oxygenation has alsobeen proposed bythe US ArmyCorps of Engineers to
replace ﬁsh habitat [4], creating an environment up-
stream of a hydropower dam that is preferred by cold-water species.
Hypolimnetic oxygenation is used to replenish DO in
reservoirs while preserving stratiﬁcation. Well-designedhypolimnetic oxygenators provide measurable increasesin DO levels [5], decrease total iron, manganese, and
hydrogen sulﬁde concentrations [6,7], and decrease blue-
green algae concentrations in some cases [8,9]. Threeprinciple devices are typically used for hypolimnetic
oxygenation: the Speece Cone [10,11], the airlift aerator
[12–15], and the bubble plume [16]. Typically, pure

PII: S0043-1354(02)00175-6oxygen is used in the Speece Cone, air is used in airlift
aerators, and either oxygen or air is used in bubbleplumes.
In all three oxygenation devices, gas bubbles in
contact with water facilitate interfacial transfer ofoxygen, as well as nitrogen and other soluble gases.Bubble size is a critical parameter in these diffused-
bubble systems because it determines the interfacial
surface area, bubble-rise velocity, and mass-transfercoefﬁcient [17]. In addition, bubble size mayvary
signiﬁcantlyas the bubbles pass through the sy stem,
especiallywhen pure oxy gen is used. For these reasons,W.uestetal.[16]usedadiscrete-bubblemodeltoaccount
for changes in the volume (due to gas transfer,
hydrostatic pressure, and water temperature) of indivi-dual bubbles rising within a bubble plume. This
approach has subsequentlybeen applied to airlift
aerators [13,18], the Speece Cone [10], and a bubbleplume [19,20]. Although limited versions of thisapproach have been used in diffused-bubble wastewater
and ozonation systems [21–23], the discrete-bubble
model has yet to be independently veriﬁed.
In this paper, the discrete-bubble model is used to
predict the rate of oxygen transfer during diffused-
bubble aeration, based solelyon knowledge of the initialbubble-size distribution and the applied air ﬂow rate. In
addition, it is shown that the Sauter-mean diameter [24]
maybe used instead of a bubble size distributionwithout anyloss of computational accuracy .2. Experimental methods
2.1. Oxygen transfer tests
Oxygen transfer tests were conducted in a 14-m
high/C22-m diameter tank with a porous ‘‘soaker’’ hose
diffuser [2] used to generate bubble-plumes. A schematicrepresentation of the diffuser arrangement is shown in
Fig. 1. A 1.5-m length of diffuser with 2 /C21.5-m lengths
of 6.4-mm diameter porous hose was located 0.6mabove the base of the tank. DO in the water was
removed using sodium sulﬁte with cobalt chloride as a
catalyst. Tests were performed at air ﬂow rates of 0.43,0.68, and 2.88Nm
3h/C01, where 1Nm3denotes 1m3of
gas at 1bar and 0 1C. The air ﬂow rate was measuredNomenclature

water remained constant at 23 1C during the tests. DO
was measured using probes placed in the tank at depths
of 3, 8, and 12m below the water surface.
2.2. Measurement and representation of bubble-size
distribution
In a separate series of experiments, a single 30-cm
length of porous hose was placed 50cm above the baseof the tank, and positioned 9cm behind a glass porthole
along with a graduated scale (2-mm resolution). Tests
were conducted at four air ﬂow rates and at waterdepths of 6.7 and 12.5m to determine the effect of air
ﬂow rate and hydrostatic pressure on initial bubble size.
Duplicate tests were performed at approximatelythesame air ﬂow rates and water depth. As shown in Fig. 2,photographs of the bubble swarm immediatelyabove
the porous hose were taken through the porthole.
The photographs were digitized and 20 bubbles were
randomlyselected for measurement. Previous research
suggests that a total of 20 bubbles will provide a
representative sample [25–27]. Because the larger bub-bles are typically not perfectly spherical, the horizontaland vertical axis of each bubble was measured. The
surface area of a bubble, A;is

where dxand dzare the bubble diameters in the
horizontal and vertical axis, respectively. The equivalent
spherical diameter is

Because of the increased complexityof apply ing the
discrete-bubble model using the entire bubble sizedistribution, a Sauter-mean diameter was calculated
for each distribution. The Sauter-mean diameter is the
diameter of a sphere having the same volume-to-surfaceratio as the distribution of bubbles [28,24], or

where diis the diameter of the individual bubbles and n

more representative for mass transfer than the mean
bubble diameter [24].
3. Discrete-bubble model
The discrete-bubble model, ﬁrst adopted byW .uest
et al. [16], is applied to bubbles that rise in plug ﬂowthrough a tank of well-mixed water. The initial bubble
size distribution and the rate of bubble formation are
assumed to be constant. Bubble coalescence and masstransfer of gases other than nitrogen and oxygen are
considered negligible. The water and air temperatures
are assumed to be equal and constant. Mass transferthrough the water surface at the top of the tank is
neglected. Finally, it is assumed that a distribution of
bubble sizes maybe represented bythe Sauter-meandiameter.
The mass-transfer ﬂux (for either oxygen or nitrogen)
across the surface of a bubble is

where KLis the liquid-side mass-transfer coefﬁcient, Cs
is the equilibrium concentration at the gas/water inter-
face, and Cis the bulk aqueous-phase concentration.
For both oxygen and nitrogen, gas-side mass-transfer
resistance maybe neglected. Henry ’s law is used to
calculate the equilibrium concentration, or

[16] based on experimental data for bubble-rise velocity
[31] and the mass-transfer coefﬁcient [17]. Using these
relationships and the changing bubble radius, both thebubble-rise velocityand the mass-transfer coefﬁcient are
recalculated as the bubble travels up the tank. Once the
bubble reaches the top of the tank, the overall change inthe molar ﬂow rate of gas (both oxygen and nitrogen) isused to incrementallycalculate the evolving bulk
aqueous-phase concentration as a function of time.
The initial DO concentration, water temperature, and
depth are known, as well as the initial Sauter-mean
diameter of the bubble swarm formed at the diffuser.

4. Results and discussion
The results of the three oxygen transfer tests are
showninFig.5.Foreachofthetests,theresponseofthe
three oxygen probes (located near the top, middle, andbottom of the tank) was virtuallyidentical, conﬁrming
that the water in the tank can be considered well-mixed.
Because the data obtained from the three probes werealmostequal,the threedatasetswereaveragedtoobtainone representative oxygen concentration proﬁle for each
experiment. To applythe discrete-bubble model, theinitial bubble size for each of the air ﬂow rates is
required.
Fig. 6 summarizes the results of the bubble size
measurements. The measured initial Sauter-mean dia-
meterisshownasafunctionoftheactualvolumetricgasﬂow rate for the tests performed at depths of 6.7 and
12.5m. Since there was essentiallyno difference between
the bubble sizes formed at these two different depths, asimple linear relationship was developed relating bubblesize to gas ﬂow rate:
d
3;2¼1:12þ0:938qðmmÞ; ð13Þ
where qis the actual gas ﬂow rate per unit length of
porous hose in units of m2h/C01. Eq. (13), which was
derived from data collected using a 30-cm length of
porous hose, was then used to predict the initial bubble
size for each of the three diffuser experiments. TheSauter-mean diameters obtained were 1.2, 1.2, and
1.6mm for the 0.43, 0.68 and 2.88Nm
3h/C01tests,
respectively. These bubble sizes and the measured airﬂow rates were used as input to the discrete-bubble
model to predict the oxygen concentration as a function
of time. The predicted results are compared in Fig.7 totheaverageofthevaluesmeasuredwiththethreeoxygen
probes. The observed and predicted DO curves compare
well, with root mean square errors of 0.65, 0.60 and 1.31for the 0.43, 0.68 and 2.88Nm
3h/C01tests, respectively.
The initial predicted oxygen transfer efﬁciency ranges
from 94.4% at the lowest air ﬂow rate to 88.1% at the
highest air ﬂow rate. Although the model tends to over-estimate the oxygen concentrations, nearly all of the
predictions fall within 15% of the observed data, as
shown in Fig.8. As indicated in Fig. 6, the indepen-dentlymeasured initial bubble sizes had a relativelyhigh
degree of variability. Given that the model is sensitive to
the initial bubble size, it maybe that the bubble-sizeTime (min)0 200 400 600 800 1000Dissolved Oxygen (g m-3)

modest error. In the following sections, some of thekeyassumptions and limitations of the discrete-bubblemodel are brieﬂyevaluated.
4.1. Bubble-size distribution
The Sauter-mean diameter maynot accuratelyrepre-
sent the average bubble-rise velocityor mass-transfercoefﬁcient of the bubble swarm. Smaller bubbles, inparticular, have rise velocities and mass-transfer coefﬁ-
cients that are verysensitive to bubble diameter. To
check the validityof the Sauter-mean diameter, thediscrete-bubble model was modiﬁed to accommodate a
range of bubble sizes. The bubble size distribution for
the 0.68Nm
3h/C01oxygen transfer test was obtained
from the bubble size data measured at 0.09m2h/C01
because the actual ﬂow rates (i.e., measured at the
diffuser depth) per unit length of porous hose wereapproximatelyequal. As shown in Fig. 9, the initial
bubble diameters in this distribution varyfrom 0.2 to
1.5mm and span the range of rapid variation in bubble-rise velocityand mass-transfer coefﬁcient. Fig.9 also
shows the ﬁnal bubble size distribution predicted for the
bubbles at the top of the tank. Using the entire bubblesize distribution instead of the Sauter-mean diameter
produced a similar rate of oxygen transfer, as shown in
Fig. 10.
4.2. Bubble-rise velocity
The discrete-bubble model uses correlation equations
to determine terminal rise velocitybased on data
collected byHaberman and Morton [31]. As shown in
Fig. 3, for diameters between 1 and 2mm, the bubble-Observed DO Concentration(gm-3)02468 1 0 1 2Predicted DO Concentration(gm-3)

different, with the W .uest et al. [16] correlation falling
between the two data sets. Since bubbles in tap water
smaller than about 2mm behave as rigid spheres withregard to rise velocity[31], the terminal rise velocitycan
be calculated from

that Eq. (14) predicts the tap water data up to a bubblediameter of 2.6mm.
Larger bubbles begin to experience surface oscilla-
tions and the rise of the bubble can be compared to awave traveling in an ideal ﬂuid [29]. Based on this waveanalogy, the rise velocity of larger bubbles can be
predicted [29] by

where sis the interfacial surface tension of water. Fig. 3
shows that Eq. (17) can be used to predict the rise
velocityfor bubbles larger than 2.6mm in tap water.Since the tap water data appear more appropriate for
hypolimnetic oxygenation, Eqs. (14) and (17) can be
used to predict the theoretical rise velocityfor the entirerange of bubble sizes and have the added beneﬁt ofincluding the dependence on temperature. However,
using the theoretical rise velocityinstead of the W .uest
et al. [16] correlation made essentiallyno difference tothe model predictions, with values shown for compara-
tive purposes in Fig. 10.
4.3. Mass-transfer coefﬁcient
The mass-transfer coefﬁcient is also estimated using a
correlation equation developed byW .uest et al. [16]. The
correlation shown in Fig. 4 gives the mass-transfer
coefﬁcient for oxygen and nitrogen as a function of
bubble radius for bubbles of diameter less thanapproximately1.3mm, and assumes a constant mass-
transfer coefﬁcient for bubbles larger than 1.3mm in
diameter. Unfortunately, the data in Fig.4 were notreferenced to a speciﬁc water temperature [17] and could
not be corrected to the temperature of the oxygen
transfer tests (23 1C). The temperature dependence ofthe mass-transfer coefﬁcient is given [30] by

of oxygen or nitrogen in water. Assuming the data of
Motarjemi and Jameson [17] were collected at 20 1C, the
mass-transfer coefﬁcients for both oxygen and nitrogenwould increase byabout 8% because the experiments
wereconductedat23 1C.However,thiscorrectionmakes
verylittle difference to the predicted oxy gen concentra-tion proﬁles shown in Fig. 7 because the oxygen transfer
process is approaching saturation. This holds at the
beginning of the experiment when the oxygen transferefﬁciencyis high, as well as towards the end of the
experiment when the aqueous concentration approaches
steadystate.
4.4. Induced water velocity
Another assumption made during the application of
the model is that anyinduced water velocityis
negligible. If this assumption is not correct, then thewater velocitywould decrease the bubble contact timeand reduce the extent to which the model over-predicts
the experimental data. Efforts were madeto measure the
induced water velocity, but it was found to be less than0.04ms
/C01, the lower measurement limit of the velocity
meter used. The discrete-bubble model was modiﬁed to
include a uniform vertical velocity(see Eq. (8)) equal to0.04ms
/C01, but Fig. 10 shows that this results in onlya
modest decrease in the predicted oxygen concentrations.
5. Conclusion
The predictions of the discrete-bubble model were
compared to the results of diffused-bubble oxygen
transfer tests conducted in a 14-m deep tank at threeair ﬂow rates. Required model inputs are the gas ﬂow
rate and the initial bubble size distribution. Although
the bubble-size distribution can be taken into account,using the Sauter-mean diameter is simpler and providesequivalent results. Based on correlation equations for
bubble-rise velocityand the mass-transfer coefﬁcient
developed byW .uest et al. [16], the model predicts all the
oxygen transfer test data to within 15%. The range of
bubblediametersmeasuredduringthetestswasfrom0.2
to 2mm, spanning the region of greatest variation in risevelocityand mass-transfer coefﬁcient. The discrete-
bubble model has also been applied to predict oxygen
transfer in a full-scale airlift aerator [18], where theD.F. McGinnis, J.C. Little / Water Research 36 (2002) 4627–4635 4633range of bubble diameters was from about 2 to 4mm.
Although the model tends to over-estimate the rate of
oxygen transfer in the well-mixed tank and under-
estimate the rate in the airlift aerator, the combinedresults suggest that the model is reliable for bubble sizes
between 0.2 and 4mm. In both cases, the initial bubble
sizes were measured in laboratoryexperiments carriedout completelyindependent of the oxy gen transfer tests.Since both sets of data had a relativelyhigh degree of
variabilityand because the model is sensitive to initial
bubble size, it appears plausible that the bubble-sizeestimation procedure is the primarysource of the
modest error.
The discrete-bubble model has been successfullyused
to predict oxygen transfer in a well-mixed tank (this
work),anairliftaerator[18],andabubbleplume[19,20].
The discrete-bubble approach has also been applied tothe Speece Cone [10], but the model could not be fully
veriﬁed due to a lack of experimental data. Because it is
known that hypolimnetic oxygenators can inducevarying degrees of mixing in a stratiﬁed reservoir [19],the suite of models is being coupled with a hydro-
dynamic and water-quality reservoir model so that
oxygenation systems can be designed more effectivelyand operated more efﬁciently.
