241INTRODUCTION 
Because of their better performance, cons -
tructed wetlands (CWs) have gradually become 
regarded as a promising solution for treating 
wastewater, especially for nitrogen and phospho -
rus removal  (Guo  et al., 2017; Jain et al., 2020; 
Zuo et al., 2020 ). Applied in the treatment plan 
for oil-contaminated, CWs showed a significant 
degrading effect on COD, heavy oil and recalcit -
rant organic compounds, as well  (Xuegong  et al., 
2005; Vander Meulen  et al., 2022) . Nitrogen in 
CWs is transformed via plant uptake and micro -
bial nitrogen removal, and the latter is thought to 
be the most complete and probably most important 
nitrogen removal mechanism in CWs (Bachand 
& Horne, 2000) . The complete microbial nitrogen 
removal process is achieved by alternate aerobic 
nitrification (NH4+→NO2−→NO3−) and anoxic 
denitrification (NO3−→NO2−→NO→N2O→N2) that require almost the opposite dissolved oxygen 
(DO) conditions  (Garcia-Lledo  et al., 2011) . By 
contrast, wetland plants supply water oxygena -
tion, surfaces for bacterial attachment, and orga -
nic carbon  (Veraart  et al., 2011) .
CWs can be categorized into free-water sur -
face CWs (FWS-CWs), and subsurface flow CWs 
(SSF-CWs) based on water flow regime (Gao  
et al., 2019). Like natural marshes, FWS-CWs 
can harbor more wetland plant types, including 
free-floating, emergent, and submerged plants 
(Vymazal, 2007) , than SSF-CWs where only 
emergent plants perform these functions. Diffe -
rent wetland plant types occupy different habitats 
and display a variety of shapes. Emergent plants 
have roots in the sediment, stems in the water, and 
leaves and flowers above the water surface. Free-
floating plants do not root in the sediment but 
float on the surface of the water, sometimes for -
ming extensive green mats on the water surface. Effect of Different Plant Monocultures on Nitrogen Removal

ABSTRACT
This study investigated the nitrogen removal performance in wetland microcosms individually planted with diffe -
rent plant monocultures, including emergent, free-floating and submerged plants during ammonia removals, or lar -
ge- and small-leaf free-floating plants during nitrate removal. For ammonia-dominated wastewater, both emergent 
(common reed) and free-floating (water hyacinth) plants in wetland microcosms achieved higher total nitrogen 
removals than a submerged plant (eelgrass) that significantly improved the microbial nitrifying performance. For 
nitrate-dominated wastewater, efficient nitrate removals in wetland microcosms planted with free-floating plant 
were achieved by both a full cover of water surface and the concentration of organic oxygen-consuming substan -
ces, which resulted in low dissolved oxygen levels and boosted microbial denitrification in wetland microcosms. 
FWS-CW developers and managers should thus pay close attention to the selection of wetland plant types and 
optimize their design to achieve optimum nitrogen removal performance.

Submerged plants are rooted with stems and le -
aves entirely underwater, and may form a low-
growing “meadow” near the sediment. The va -
rious wetland plant types supported in FWS-CWs 
makes them a nature-based sustainable resource 
management technology that provides both pol -
lutant removal and ecological services (Chen, 
2011). It seems that FWS-CWs should be desig -
ned, constructed, and operated on the basis of the 
effect of wetland plant types on pollutant removal 
when its ecological services are fully considered. 
Many studies demonstrated that different 
plant types strongly influenced the nitrate nit -
rogen removal in CWs  (Zheng  et al., 2020; Ruan  
et al., 2021) , and the highest denitrification effi -
ciencies were frequently reported in FWS-CWs 
planted with free-floating plants (Veraart  et al., 
2011 ; Li et al., 2020) . It was suspected that di -
fferent plant types exerted different influences on 
oxygen conditions in FWS-CWs, and that free-
floating plants can provide a barrier (‘close mat’) 
to atmospheric oxygen transfer to promote mi -
crobial denitrification  (Kadlec, 2008; Veraart  et 
al., 2011 ). However, it is not clear if the different 
oxygenation performance of various plant types 
can influence the microbial nitrification perfor -
mance in FWS-CWs, since aerobic nitrification 
process is thought to be the rate-limiting step in 
the microbial nitrogen removal process (Sham -
mas, 1986) . Also, no experimental data are avai -
lable to verify the hypothesis on efficient nitrate 
removals in free-floating plant-based FWS-CWs. 
It seems that FWS-CWs still lack some critical 
elements needed to optimize their treatment func -
tion and system sustainability. 
This study investigated the nitrogen removal 
performance in wetland microcosms individually 
planted with different plant monocultures. First -
ly, we established three wetland microcosms, in -
dividually planted with monocultures of typical 
emergent, free-floating, or submerged plants, to 
compare their abilities to remove pollutants from 
ammonia-dominated wastewater with that of an 
unplanted microcosm as a control. In subsequ -
ent microcosm experiments, we investigated the 
effect of different free-floating plants (large- or 
small-leaf free-floating plants with an abiotic co -
ver as control) and organic oxygen-consuming 
substance concentration (represented by initial 
chemical oxygen demand (CODin) levels) on nit -
rate removal performance in FWS-CWs planted 
with free-floating plants.As a rhizomatous perennial wetland emergent 
plant, P . australis  typically forms homogenous 
belts (monocultures) in various wetlands  (Wir -
sel, 2004; Shukla  et al., 2021) . Among the free-
floating plants, E. crassipes and duckweeds have 
been extensively studied for their nutrient-remo -
val potential in FWS-CWs because of their fast 
growth rate and large uptake of nutrients and con -
taminants  (Sooknah & Wilkie, 2004; Jampeetong  
et al., 2012; Kalengo  et al., 2021).  As a dominant 
submerged plant species in some lakes  (Li et al., 
2010) , V . spiralis  is a perennial rooted plant with 
a high adaptive capability and a wide geograp -
hical range  (Wang & Yu, 2007; Malschi  et al., 
2018 ); it can expand its distribution through sto -
lons, forming monospecific beds in both stagnant 
and lotic freshwater environments (Racchetti  et 
al., 2010) . In this study, these wetland plants were 
chosen as model plant species because they are 
the most widely distributed wetland plants worl -
dwide. The level of plant coverage is often con -
sidered to be a key factor controlling nitrogen 
removal in wetlands (Garcia-Lledo  et al., 2011). 
To avoid the effect of different levels of coverage 
on pollutant removal performance, V . spiralis, E. 
crassipes,  and L. aequinoctialis were all estab -
lished at 100% coverage.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Effect of wetland plant type on the treatment 
of ammonia-dominated wastewater
A 10-cm layer of local lake sediment was pla -
ced into the bottom of three experimental wetland 
microcosms (0.72×0.52×0.45 m), which were 
then planted with monocultures of common reed 
(Phragmites australis ), water hyacinth ( Eichhor -
nia crassipes ), or eelgrass ( Vallisneria spiralis ) 
collected from a local pond or brook. Another mi -
crocosm was left non-vegetated to serve as a con -
trol. The planting density for P . australis  was 101 
clumps/m2, whereas 100% coverage was created 
for V . spiralis  and E. crassipes . To improve mi -
crobial concentrations in the wetland microcosms, 
a microbial enrichment culture was independently 
cultured under aerobic conditions in 1000 L river 
water (pH 7–8) by the addition of 2 kg local soil, 
80 g peptone, and 1.3 g KH2PO4 for seven days. 
Initially, the wetland plants were pre-grown in 
168 L river water for two weeks. Subsequently, 
the water in each microcosm was replaced by an 243
Journal of Ecological Engineering  2022, 23(9), 241–249
equal volume of enrichment culture. The DO and 
pH were then measured in situ using a HQ30d DO 
meter with an LDO101 optimal DO probe (Hach, 
Loveland, CO, USA) and a PHS-3C pH meter 
(Kexiao Instruments, Zibo, China) , respectively, 
and daily water samples were taken for the mea -
surement of pollutant concentrations. Since wet -
land plants can release organic carbon following 
senescence  (Veraart  et al., 2011) , dead leaves were 
removed every day to avoid their potential effect 
(organic carbon of plant sources) on microbial nit -
rogen removal process.
Effect of wetland plant type  (water 
coverage ) on the treatment of 
nitrate-dominated wastewater
In this study, the simulated nitrate-dominated 
agricultural runoff was prepared by the addition 
of glucose, KNO3, and KH2PO4 in river water to 
investigate the nitrate reduction mechanism in 
FWS-CWs fully covered by water hyacinth or 
duckweed.  Three wetland microcosms were cons -
tructed with 100% coverage of monocultures of 
E. crassipesor  duckweed ( Lemna aequinoctialis ).  
An additional microcosm was covered with 
4-cm-thick foam sheets as a control. To ensure 
that there were sufficient denitrifying bacteria in 
the wetland microcosms, a microbial enrichment 
culture was prepared in 24 L river water (pH 7–8) 
by the addition of 2 kg local soil, 2.3 g glucose, 
1.7 g KNO3, and 0.2 g KH2PO4 for three days. 
The plants were pre-grown in 151 L river water 
for two weeks. Subsequently, 1 L microbial en -
richment culture, 15 g dissolving glucose, 11 g 
KNO3, and 1 g KH2PO4 were added to each mi -
crocosm containing 151 L river water. In situ DO 
and pH measurements were then conducted, and 
water samples were taken daily for the measure -
ment of pollutant concentrations.
Effects of organic oxygen-consuming 
substances  on nitrate removal performance 
in the wetland microcosms
Three L. aequinoctialis  microcosms (100% 
coverage) were created by dissolving 6.8 g KNO3 
and 0.8 g KH2PO4 in 94 L river water. Approxi -
mately 0, 4.7, and 15.1 g glucose were added to 
the three individual wetland microcosms to inves -
tigate the potential effect of the concentrations of 
organic oxygen-consuming substances on nitrate 
removal performance in the wetland microcosms planted with L. aequinoctialis . All other experi -
mental methods were as described above for the 
previous treatments.
Sample analyses
Water samples were pre-filtered (0.45-μm 
polyether sulfone membrane) prior to the deter -
mination of COD, total nitrogen (TN), nitrite-nit -
rate nitrogen (NOx-N), and NH3–N. COD was 
determined using a spectrophotometer (Hanna 
DR/3000, Hanna Co., Italy), and TN, NOx-N, and 
NH3-N were analyzed using flow injection analy -
sis on a Skalar San++ Automated Ion Analyzer 
(Skalar Co., The Netherlands). All pollutant con -
centrations were corrected based on practical 
evapotranspiration to avoid an overestimation of 
concentrations  (Weisner & Thiere, 2010) .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Effect of wetland plant type on treatment 
of ammonia-dominated wastewater
In recent decades, there is a growing interest 
in the use of CWs to purify a variety of wastewa -
ters, most of which focus on municipal wastewater  
(Zheng  et al. 2010) , a kind of ammonia-dominated 
wastewater. The simulated ammonia-dominated 
wastewater presented here (35–50 mg COD L-1,  
6.9–7.4 mg TN L-1, 4.6–5.9 mg NH3-N L-1,  
and 0.2–0.4 mg NOx-N L-1) approximated to the 
low-strength municipal sewage reported in our 
previous study (73 mg COD L-1, 6.9 mg TN L-1,  
5.39 mg NH3-N L-1, and 0.3 mg NOx-N L-1) 
(Zheng  et al., 2010) . The ammonia-dominated 
wastewater was supplied to the three wetland mi -
crocosms planted respectively with monocultures 
of P . australis , E. crassipes , and V . spiralis , and 
their pollutant removal performances were com -
pared with an unplanted control. 
Figure 1 shows the time courses of COD, 
TN, NH3-N, and NOx-N levels in four wetland 
microcosms during a 14-day experimental pe -
riod. COD removals of 74–75% were achieved 
in the P . australis  and E. crassipes  microcosms  
by the end of the experiment, but COD remo -
vals were only 36% and 46% in the V . spiralis 
microcosm and control, respectively. Similarly, 
TN removals of 87% and 8 6%, respectively, 
were achieved in the P . australis and E. crassi -
pes microcosms, 7 5% and 70% in  the V . spiralis 244
Journal of Ecological Engineering  2022, 23(9), 241–249
microcosms  and the control. NH3-N was the pre -
dominant form of inorganic nitrogen (approxi -
mately 67–83%) at the onset of the experiment 
and was reduced to almost zero in all treatments 
by the end of the experiment, with removals of 
99% and 91% in the planted microcosms and 
the control, respectively. It is well known that 
aquatic plants in CWs facilitated nutrient re -
moval mainly through plant uptake, fixation of 
inorganic and organic particulates, and oxygen 
release from the plant roots to create an oxidized 
rhizosphere (Zheng  et al., 2010) . It seems that, 
in most cases, the pollutants in planted micro -
cosms were removed more efficiently than those 
in unplanted microcosms, except for the COD 
in the V . spiralis microcosm. Furthermore, the 
P . australis  and E. crassipes  microcosms remo -
ved pollutants more efficiently than the V . spira -
lis microcosm. In a previous study, free-floating 
plants (water hyacinth, pennywort, and water 
lettuce) also achieved NH3-N and soluble COD 
removals of 99% and 68%, respectively, for am -
monia-rich anaerobically digested flushed dairy 
manure wastewater  (Sooknah & Wilkie, 2004) . 
Kalengo  et al. (2021)  investigated  the NH3-N 
removal efficiency  of Eichhornia crassipes  for 
aquacultural effluents  treatment, datas show that  
summer and autumn have high NH3-N removal 
efficiencies  with 98% .
Alongside the reduction in NH3-N concen -
trations, a significant increase (four times) in 
NOx-N concentrations was observed in the  V. 
spiralis  microcosm. Previous investigations 
have demonstrated the importance of DO con -
centrations for nitrification, and low nitrification 
efficiency is often attributed to a lack of availab -
le DO (Wang & Yu 2007) . Oxygen is released 
from emergent (Bezbaruah & Zhang, 2005)  and 
free-floating  (Sooknah & Wilkie, 2004) plant ro -
ots or submerged plant leaves (Toet  et al., 2005) 
through photosynthesis and is a main oxygen 
supply in FWS-CWs (along with atmospheric 
diffusion). However, it seems that only the su -
bmerged plants can increase oxygen concentra -
tions in the water column, which may create the 
aerobic environment required for the growth of 
nitrifying bacteria in FWS-CWs. However, be -
cause of their low COD and TN removal effi -
ciencies, submerged plants should be used as 
the terminal wetland plant type in FWS-CWs to 
further purify wastewater prior to discharge.
Generally, evapotranspiration from vege -
tation is dominated by transpiration (Kadlec, 2006), whereas evaporation is dominant for 
barren surfaces (Kadlec, 2008) . Evapotranspi -
ration has been suggested to be higher in wet -
lands with dense emergent plant coverage than 
in unplanted sites (Batty  et al., 2006) . Kirzhner 
et al. (2008)  found that the evapotranspiration 
rates of emergent ( Scirpus maritimus  and Eleo-
charis palustris ) and free-floating ( E. crassipes  
and Pistia stratiotes ) plants were 10–18 and 2–4 
mm/d, respectively. In the present study, the 
average evapotranspiration rates of emergent, 
free-floating, submerged plants, and the control 
were 11, 6, 2, and 7 mm/d, respectively (data not 
shown), in agreement with previous findings. 
The emergent plant microcosm consistently had 
Figure  1. Time courses of COD, TN, NH3-N and 
NOx-N levels in four wetland microcosms during 14 
days.Results are presented in mean ± SD which is 
represented as error bars (n = 3)245

higher evapotranspiration than the other three 
microcosms. Therefore, although the emergent 
plants exhibited good pollutant removal perfor -
mances, similar to free-floating plants, their high 
evapotranspiration rate may limit their applica -
bility in arid or semi-arid regions. Furthermore, 
free-floating plants have the following advanta -
ges over other wetland plants: (1) higher produc -
tivity than several free-floating plants; (2) higher 
nutritive value of floating plants relative to many 
emergent species; and (3) ease of stocking and 
harvesting  (Sooknah & Wilkie, 2004) . Therefo -
re, free-floating plants should be considered as 
a candidate species for purifying ammonia-do -
minated wastewater in FWS-CWs. In fact, many 
species of free-floating plants, such as E. crassi -
pes, water lettuce( Pistia stratiotes ), duckweeds, 
and watermoss ( Salvinia spp .), have been used 
in FWS-CWs (Sooknah & Wilkie, 2004; Jam -
peetong  et al., 2012) .
Effect of wetland plant type  (water 
coverage ) on the treatment of 
nitrate-dominated wastewater
Nitrate removal from agricultural runoffs, 
e.g., plant nursery and aquaculture wastewater in 
which nitrate frequently makes up the majority 
of the nitrogen, is always very important in view 
of the adverse impacts of nitrate on humans and the environment (Yang  et al., 2008). In previous 
studies, free-floating plants achieved NOx-N re -
movals of 86% (Lin et al., 2002)  or higher. In this 
study, we investigated the effect of full coverage 
of a water surface by large-leaf water hyacinth  
(Eichhornia crassipes ) or small-leaf duckweed  
(Lemna aequinoctialis ) on nitrate removal per -
formance, in comparison to an abiotic coverage 
(foam sheets) as a control  (Fig. 2 ). The simula -
ted nitrate-dominated wastewater presented here 
(79–82 mg COD L-1, 12–14 mg TN L-1, 1–2 mg 
NH3-N L-1, and 10–11 mg NOx-N L-1) approxima -
ted to those agricultural runoffs reported in pre -
vious study (10.1 mg TN L-1 (74% as NOx-N L-1) 
(Huett  et al., 2005) . 
Figure 2 shows the time courses of COD, TN, 
NH3-N, NOx-N, DO, and pH levels in three wet -
land microcosms during an 11-day experimental 
period. At the end of the experiment,  COD remo -
vals of 58–6 3% were achieved in the three micro -
cosms. Approximately 99% NOx-N removal and 
92% TN removal were achieved in the L. aequi -
noctialis microcosm and the control, while only 
63% NOx-N removal and 53% TN removal were 
achieved in the E. crassipes  microcosm.
The DO levels decreased sharply to < 1 mg L-1  
since  the third day of treatment in the L. aequi -
noctialis microcosm and the control, whereas 
most measurements were > 1.5 mg L-1 in the  
E. crassipes microcosm. Correspondingly, after 
Figure  2. Time courses of COD, TN, NH3-N and NOx-N, DO and pH levels in three wetland microcosms 
during 11 days.  Results are presented in mean ± SD which is represented as error bars (n = 3)246
Journal of Ecological Engineering  2022, 23(9), 241–249
three days of treatment, further nitrate removal 
was observed in the L. aequinoctialis microcosm 
and the control, but there was no further nitrate 
removal in the E. crassipes microcosm. These 
results suggest that the DO level critically affec -
ted the nitrate reduction performance in the three 
microcosms, and lower DO levels improved the 
transformation of NOx-N into N2 via a microbial 
denitrification process. In this study, the pH va -
lues in the three microcosms were maintained 
between 6.9 and 7.3, which falls inside the op -
timal pH range (pH 6–8) for high denitrification 
activity (Jansson  et al., 1994) .
Although the large-leaf E. crassipes  was 
more productive than small-leaf duckweed  
(Sooknah & Wilkie, 2004) ., our results sugges -
ted that the duckweed microcosm had a higher 
NOx-N removal rate than the E. crassipes  micro -
cosm. It appears that E. crassipes cannot com -
pletely cover the water surface like L. aequi -
noctialis and the foam sheet, possibly due to its 
larger leaves and spatial structure, which resul -
ted in atomospheric diffusion to some extent. 
The abiotic coverage (foam sheet) without an 
oxygen release capability also achieved NOx-N 
and TN removals as high as those recorded for 
L. aequinoctialis , demonstrating a mechanism 
of nitrate reduction in free-floating plant-based 
FWS-CWs, i.e., free-floating plants provide a 
barrier to atmospheric oxygen transfer into the 
FWS-CWs by fully covering the water surfa -
ce. The resulting low DO levels in FWS-CWs 
further boosted denitrification and prevented 
nitrate-nitrogen levels from increasing through 
the nitrification of ammonia (Nahlik & Mitsch, 
2006) . This also explains how a floating-raft 
hydroponic system can achieve a NOx-N remo -
val of ~97% for nitrate-rich agricultural runoff  
(Yang  et al., 2008) .
Effects of organic oxygen-consuming 
substances  on nitrate removal performance 
in the wetland microcosms
In addition to surface coverage, the concen -
tration of organic oxygen-consuming substances 
potentially influences the DO concentrations in 
FWS-CWs. The effect of the concentrations of 
organic oxygen-consuming substances on nitrate 
removal performance in the wetland microcosms 
planted with  L. aequinoctialis  was investigated 
at CODin levels of 85, 58, and 28 mg L-1, res-
pectively. With an increase in CODin level, COD removal was significantly increased from 7% 
to 61%, NOx-N removal increased from 21% to 
99%, and TN removal increased from 2 0% to 
89% (Fig. 3). Three and nine days were requi -
red to achieve 0 mg DO L-1 in the microcosms at 
CODin levels of 82 and 58 mg L-1, respectively, 
while the DO level was maintained at > 2 mg L-1  
at a CODin level of 28 mg L-1 throughout the 
experimental period (Fig. 4).
There appears to be a positive correlation 
between the NOx-N removals and the CODin 
level (and thus DO concentration) in these mi -
crocosms. Higher CODin levels will deplete 
oxygen concentrations in the FWS-CWs, creat -
ing DO conditions that are favorable for micro -
bial denitrification , and donate the electrons for 
denitrification  process. In contrast, carbon limi -
tation may hamper the nitrate removal potential 
of free-floating plant-based FWS-CWs. Therefo -
re, merely the formation of a closed mat of free-
floating plants is not enough to achieve a better 
nitrate reduction performance. The presence of 
sufficient organic oxygen-consuming substances 
is also necessary to optimize the nitrate reduction 
performance of FWS-CWs.
CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrated that different wet -
land plant types strongly influence pollutant 
removal in ammonia-dominated wastewater. 
Free-floating plants were the best candidates for 
purification of ammonia-dominated wastewater 
when both pollutant removal performance and 
evapotranspiration were considered simultane -
ously. On the other hand, optimum nitrate reduc -
tion in free-floating plant-based FWS-CWs will 
occur only when there are enough organic oxy -
gen-consuming substances present, as well as a 
fully covered water surface. FWS-CW develop -
ers and managers should thus pay close attention 
to the selection of wetland plant types and opti -
mize their design to achieve optimum nitrogen 
removal performance.
