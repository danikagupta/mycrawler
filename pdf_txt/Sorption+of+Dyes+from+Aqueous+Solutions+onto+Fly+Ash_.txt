Abstract:  Fly ash, a residue from thermal power plant, is a waste material. It was investigated as new alternative low cost adsorbent to 
lower methylene blue dye concentration from synthetic waste stream which represent textile wastewater. Potential of adsorbent  was 
identified by doing characterization. Before using fly ash as adsorbent, it was physically activated. Activation proc ess is described in 
upcoming section. Wastewater stream was prepared synthetically to create artificial actual scenario.In the present study, studies were 
conducted as a function of adsorbent dosage, temperature, concentration dosage, and pH on adsorption process. We found that, there is no 
considerable effect of temperature on adsorption. We only check for Freuindlich adsorption isotherm. As regression co-efficient is 0.8351, 
we can’t say that all adsorption data is well fitted in this isotherm model.

1. Introduction 
Discharge of hazardous wastewater without further 
treatment can seriously damage the environment. Sunlight 
and oxygen are very important requirements of aquatic 
life, but the c oloured discharged effluents inhibit 
penetration of sunlight and oxygen. It adversely affects on life [1]. We have to remove dyes from wastewater of 
dyeing and finishing operation in textile industry. In 
process of washing and finishing coloured products, 
wastewater contaminated with dyes is generated 
[2].Trickling filter, activated sludge, chemical coagulation 
and flocculation, oxidation, ozonation, membrane 
separation, photo degradation, and adsorption processes 
are most conventional waste water treatment  technologies 
[3-6]. Though these techniques are most effective, 
includes high initial cost and operating cost. Some of them are not feasible on large scale. Physical adsorption has 
received considerable attention as an effective method for 
removing the concentration of dissolved dyes in waste 
streams [7, 8]. We can achieve desired degree of removal 
as economical solution by choosing appropriate adsorbent 
which is omnipresent at low cost. Research has been done 
on. Previously, many low cost adsorbent have been 
investigated on dye removal, such as fly ash [9- 13], 
bottom ash [14], clay [15], zeolite [15- 16], calcine alunite 
[17], peanut hull [18], rice husk [19], and brown seaweed 
[20]. Fly Ash, is a waste substance from thermal power plants, steel mills, etc that is found in abundance. Waste 
utilization is gaining importance for controlling pollution
. 2. Materials and Methods 
2.1 Preparation of Activated Flyash  
Fly ash used for the work is collected from the “Deepnagar”, Thermal Power Station, near Jalgaon (Maharashtr a, India). Fly 
ash is sieved to remove unwanted materials. Fly ash is washed with water (50 g with 500 ml of water - 5 times). Washed fly 
ash is activated  by heating it in oven at 110 
0c for 24 hours. 
Activated fly ash is again sieved to obtain desired siz e of 
particles (52 meshes).   
2.2 Stock Solution 
Stock solution was prepared by dissolving 1 gram of 
Methylene Blue Dye in 1 liter double distilled water. And 
afterwards, it was diluted in double distilled water as per our 
requirement.  
2.3 Characterization of Flyash  
The diffractogram , fig 1,  shows the X -ray diffraction pattern 
for particle size is 52  μm. It was found that the fly ash 
consisted of crystalline minerals mullite, quartz, hematite and 
small amounts of  calcium oxide with large characteristic peaks 
of quartz (SiO
2). This result is similar to that reported for a fly 
ash investigated. The inte nsity of quartz is very strong, with 
mullite forming a chemically stable and dense glassy surface 
layer. The low calcium oxide intensity is characteristic of low -
Ca Class -F CFA

3. Batch Experiments 
3.1  Effect of Adsorb ent Dosage  
The effect of adsorbent dosage on the amount adsorbed was 
obtained by agitating 60 mL of MB solution of concentration 
0.5g/L with 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 g of Fly Ash at room temperature for 
60 min at a constant stirring speed 
3.2 Effect of Temperature 
The effect of temperature on amount adsorbed was obtained by 
agitating 60 mL of MB solution of concentration 0.5g/L with 3 g Fly Ash at temperature 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 ºC for 60 min at a 
constant stirring speed.  
3.3 Effect of Concentration Dosages  
100 ml of dye solution was prepared in different conical flasks 
with different dye conc.(1g/L, 0.75g/L, 0.5g/L, 0.25g/L, 0.125g/L) and adsorbent 5g/60ml. The final dye concentration 
readings were taken after putting the 5 flasks inside the taken 
for 24 hours. A pl ot of % q e vs concentration dose is taken.  
3.4 Effect of pH  
100 ml of dye solution was prepared in a conical flask with dye conc. 0.5gm/L and adsorbent conc. (1g/60ml) and initial 
pH of the conical flask is to be measured. The pH of the dye 
solutions was  adjusted with dilute HCl (0.05N) or KOH 
(0.05N) solution by using a pH meter (EUTECH Instrument, 
pH 510).100 ml of dye solution was prepared and the pH of 
solution is changed from 3 to 11.The flasks were placed on 
magnetic stirrer (120rpm fixed throughout  the study) 
maintained at 27 
oC and the final concentration of dye was 
measured using UV spectrophotometer and the calibration plot of the dye after 2 hours. A graph is to be plotted with % qe vs 
initial pH.  
3.5 Percentage Removal  
The percentage adsorptio n of metal ion was calculated as 
follows:  
                
 
Co-Initial Concentration of MB, Ce- Concentration of MB at 
respective time interval  
3.6 Sample Analysis  The total concentration of MB in solution was determined 
according to the standa rd methods of analysis using UV –
Visible Spectrophotometer at λ = 665 nm (JASCO UV/Vis -
550) 
4. Results and Discussion  
The standardization of UV reading for known concentration of Methylene blue in aqueous solution is done.  The graph shown 
below, fig.2,  gives the concentration values of methylene blue 
for the UV reading. Thus one can find out the concentration of 
methylene blue in aqueous solution from the given known UV-
Visible  reading . The adsorption of MB on the Fly Ash was 
investigated as a function of the adsorbent dosage, 
concentration dosage, pH and temperature. The performance of 
Fly Ash for the MB removal using the experimental equilibrium data for Freundlich adsorption isotherms was 
tested.

4.1 Effect of Adsorbent Dose  
Fig.3 shows the effect of adsorbent dose on percentage 
removal. In the cases i.e. where fly ash is used as adsorbent, 
the sorption efficiency increased with an increase in adsorbent 
dosage. This is due to an increase in the surface area of the 
adsorbent which in turn increases the number of binding sites. But as we are going to increase adsorbent dose, we should 
consider that system is continually being bulkier. So, further 
studies carried out at lower adsorbent dosage for simplification of operation. It let to decrease in removal efficiency.

4.2  Effect of  Temperature 
It was observed that there is no considerable effect of higher 
temperature on removal efficiency. So, we can perform other

studies as functi on of different parameter at room temperature 
simply .Effect of temperature on removal is indicated in fig. 4.

4.3 Effect of Concentration Dosage  
 
 
Fig5: Effect of Concentration dosage  
Fig.5 depicts the effect of concentration dosage on removal. 
One can predict that as concentration of methylene blue 
increases the per cent adsorption decreases for constant 
amount of adsorbent due to insufficient adsorption sites at 
adsorbent.  
4.4 Effect of pH  
 The effect  of pH on percentage removal is shown in fig. 6.In 
This case pH is increased from 3 to 11. It appears that silica 
and alumina , which are chief constituents  of fly ash, form 
metal –hydroxide complexes in solution & the subsequent 
acidic or basic dissociati on of these complexes at the solid 
solution interface leads to either positive or negative surface 
charge [21].At acidic pH, the dissociation of the metal 
hydroxide complexes causes the surface to become positively 
charged. However, with increasing pH, the  surface becomes 
negatively charged as in the alkaline medium the silica and alumina get converted into SiO
2- and Al 2O3- type of 
functional sites and, therefore, the binding of positively 
charged dyes onto these surfaces become much favourable 
resulting in  enhanced adsorption of dyes [22- 23].The variation 
of adsorption with pH can be explained by considering the difference in the structure of the dyes, as well as the point of 
zero charge of the fly ash (which is 5.8). The main constituents 
of fly ash are si lica and alumina. The ZPC (a concept; related 
to the adsorption process; describes the condition when the electrical charge density on a surface is zero) of silica is 2.3, 
while that of alumina is 8.2, and as such the surface of fly ash 
would have high pos itive charge density below pH value of 
5.8, i.e. ZPC of the fly ash[a]. Under these conditions the uptake of positively  charged dyes would be low; with 
increasing pH, the negative -charge density on the surface 
increases resulting in enhanced removal.  
4.5 A dsorption Isotherms  From fig.7,  it clearly seen that we didn’t have linearized 
adsorption isotherm. Only Freundlich isotherm model has been 
employed to evaluate the adsorption data for methylene blue. 
Freundlich isotherm is based on the assumption of uniform 
energy throughout concentration of methylene blue.   
Freundlich isotherm can be expressed for the given system as, Y=0.613 and X= 0.033.  
5. Conclusion 
In this study, the adsorption of Fly Ash was investigated and 
the following conclusions can be drawn.  
1. The uptake capacity of methylene blue increased with 
increasing adsorbent dosage.  
2. There is no effect of temperature on removal efficiency.  
3. The concentration of methylene blue increases the % 
adsorption decreases for constant amount of adsorbent.  
4. In Case of methylene blue higher pH, increased the rate of 
adsorption.  
5. The adsorption isotherm was not well described by 
Freundlich model.
