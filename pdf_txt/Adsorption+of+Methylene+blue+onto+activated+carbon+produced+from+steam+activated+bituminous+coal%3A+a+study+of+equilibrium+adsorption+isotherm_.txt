The adsorption of methylene blue (MB) onto activated carbon produced from ﬂamboyant pods ( Delonix
regia ) and obtained under optimized conditions (AC op) was carried out in this work. The experimental
equilibrium data were analyzed using the isotherms of Langmuir, Freundlich, Jovanovic, Harkins–Jura,Tempkin, Redlich–Peterson, Toth, Radke–Prausnitz, Sips, Vieth–Sladek, and Brouers–Sotolongo. Theadsorption kinetics of pseudo-ﬁrst order, pseudo-second order, and Avrami were used for the kineticstudies. For the Toth isotherm, the value of maximum adsorption capacity ( Q
m= 889.58 mg g−1) was
close to the experimental value ( Qm= 890 mg g−1), and the correlation coefﬁcient ( R2) was 0.9836. The
experimental data ﬁtted very well to Avrami kinetic model. The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopyspectra and the scanning electron microscopy images showed the presence of MB adsorbed onto AC
op.
Several possible mechanisms of interaction that can occur in the MB–AC opsystem are discussed. AC opis

1. Introduction
Dyes are widely used in industries such as the textile, paper, pulp
mill, leather, dye synthesis, printing, food, and plastics industries.Since many of the organic dyestuffs are harmful to human beingsand toxic to microorganisms, removal of dyestuffs from wastewa-ter has received considerable attention over the past decades [1,2] .
Most of these dyes pose acute problems for the ecological system,as they are toxic and have carcinogenic properties, which makethe water contaminated with dyes inhibitory to aquatic life. Textileindustries produce signiﬁcant amounts of wastewater containingdyes. The main sources of wastewater generated by the textileindustry originate from the washing and bleaching of natural ﬁbersand from the fabric dyeing and ﬁnishing steps. Given the greatvariety of ﬁbers, dyes and process aids, these processes generatewastewater of great chemical complexity and diversity [3]. Many
types of dyes, such as direct, reactive, acid, and basic dyes, are usedin the textile industry [3].
With industrialization, the discharge of industrial wastewater
has increased. At the same time, there are environmental concerns,and there is the need to ﬁnd cheap and efﬁcient methods for thetreatment of industrial wastewater prior to disposal into naturalwaters [4,5] . The most efﬁcient method for the removal of dyes from
aqueous efﬂuents is the adsorption process [6]. Various adsorbents,

indica ) leaf powder [2], jute ﬁber carbon [7], Abu-Tartour phos-
phate rock [8], black stone cherries [9], Jordanian diatomite [6],
hazelnut shell [10], spent activated clay [1], bamboo activated car-
bon[11], coir pith carbon [12], Egyptian rice hull [13], vetiver root
activated carbon [14], rattan sawdust [15], activated carbon from
oil palm wood [16], garlic peel [17], and montmorillonite clay [18]
have been studied for adsorption of methylene blue from aqueoussolutions. Among the adsorbents mentioned, the activated carbons(ACs) have the highest dye removal efﬁciency due to their large sur-face area and the functional groups on their surface that facilitateinteractions with various dyes.
Methylene blue (MB) is the cationic dye that is most com-
monly used for coloring. It is generally used for dyeing cotton,wool, and silk. MB can cause eye burns in humans and animals,methemoglobinemia, cyanosis, convulsions, tachycardia, dyspnea,irritation to the skin, and if ingested, irritation to the gastrointesti-nal tract, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea [7]. This dye has been
studied because of its known strong adsorption onto solids, andit often serves as a model compound for removing organic contam-inants and colored bodies from aqueous solutions [11].
Previous studies described the preparation, characterization,
and optimization based on response surface methodology [19,20] ,
of microporous activated carbon produced from ﬂamboyant pods(Delonix regia ). The objective of this work was to study the removal
of methylene blue from aqueous solutions using this activatedcarbon prepared under optimized conditions (AC
op). In order to
establish the removal capacity of this adsorbent, different models of

isotherms and adsorption kinetics were ﬁtted to the experimental
data. The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scan-ning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses were used to assess theadsorbent material before and after dye adsorption. Finally, somepossible mechanisms of adsorption are discussed.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Adsorbent
The AC
opwas prepared by chemical activation with NaOH using
ﬂamboyant pods ( D. regia ), as reported in the literature [20]. The
physical and chemical properties of the adsorbent (AC op) are pre-
sented in Table 1 .
2.2. Adsorbate
The cationic dye, methylene blue (MB) or Basic Blue 9 (B. Her-
zog, Germany), was used as an adsorbate in this work. It hasthe molecular formula C
16H18N3SCl and the molecular weight of
319.85 g mol−1. The chemical structure of MB is shown in Fig. 1 .
2.3. Batch adsorption studies
A stock solution of 1.0 g L−1was prepared by dissolving the
appropriate amount of MB in 100 mL and completing to 1000 mLwith distilled water. Batch adsorption was performed in a set of50-mL plastic ﬂasks containing 25 mL of MB solutions with variousinitial concentrations (100–1000 mg L
−1). The amount of 0.025 g of
ACopwas added to each ﬂask and kept at 25◦C on a shaker. For
equilibrium studies, the experiment was carried out for 2.5 h toensure equilibrium was reached. Previous tests were performedvarying the solution pH from 2 to 10 and the MB removal of approx-imately 90% in all pH range was determined. Therefore, the pH 6.5was selected because favors the adsorption system MB–AC
op. All
samples were ﬁltered prior to analysis (using 0.45- /H9262m membrane
ﬁlters) in order to minimize interference of small particles of the

tions before and after adsorption were determined using a UV–Visspectrophotometer (Varian Cary 50 UV/Vis) at its maximum wave-length ( /NAK) of 664 nm. The MB concentration was determined by
comparing absorbance to a calibration curve previously obtained.All experiments were duplicated and only the mean values werereported. The amount of MB adsorbed onto AC
op,qe(mg g−1) was
calculated by Eq. (1):
qe=(C0−Ce)V
W(1)
where C0and Ce(mg L−1) are the initial and equilibrium liquid-
phase concentrations of MB, respectively, V(L) is the volume of the
solution, and W(g) is the mass of dry adsorbent used. For batch
kinetic studies, the same procedure was followed, but the aqueoussamples were taken at preset time intervals. The concentrations ofMB were similarly measured. The amount of MB adsorbed at anytime, q
t(mg g−1), was calculated by Eq. (2):
qt=(C0−Ct)V
W(2)
where Ct(mg L−1) is the liquid-phase concentration of MB at any
time. Initial concentrations of 800, 900, and 1000 mg L−1of the dye
and an adsorption time of 150 min (30-min intervals) were studied.The normalized standard deviation, /Delta1q

2.4. Adsorption isotherm and kinetic models
The application of adsorption isotherms is very useful to
describe the interaction between the adsorbate and the adsorbentof any system. The parameters obtained from the different modelsprovide important information on the sorption mechanisms andthe surface properties and afﬁnities of the adsorbent. There areseveral equations for analyzing experimental adsorption equilib-rium data, being that the most accepted surface adsorption modelsfor single solute systems are the Langmuir and Freundlich model.However, an interesting trend in the isotherm modeling is thederivation in more than one approach, thus directing to the dif-ference in the physical interpretation of the model parameters.Therefore, in this study, the isotherms of two parameters (Langmuir[3,8,11,12] , Freundlich [3,8,11,12] , Harkins–Jura [21], Jovanovic
[21] and Tempkin [12,21,22] ) and three parameters (Sips [22–25] ,
Vieth–Sladek [24,25] , Redlich–Peterson [3,14,22] , Radke–Prausnitz
[23–25] , Brouers–Sotolongo [14], and Toth [22–25] ) were applied.
Table 2 shows the equations and parameters of such isotherms.
The theoretical model most appropriately that describes theexperimental data of the MB–AC
opsystem was chosen from the
adsorption capacity ( Qm), correlation coefﬁcient ( R2) values, and
normalized standard deviation ( /Delta1qe).
On the other hand, to understand the dynamics of adsorp-
tion in relation to time in the MB–AC opsystem, pseudo-ﬁrst
order [4,6,8,10,26] , pseudo-second order [4,6,8,10,26] , and Avrami
[27,28] kinetic models were used. Table 3 shows the equations and
parameters of these kinetic models. All models were ﬁt employingthe non-linear ﬁtting method by Origin 6.0 software.724 A.M.M. Vargas et al. / Chemical Engineering Journal 168 (2011) 722–730

2.5. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), pH drift method, and Boehm titration
The surface organic structures of the AC op, MB, and MB adsorbed
onto AC opwere studied by FT-IR spectra recorded at 4 cm−1of res-
olution and 20 scans min−1between 4000 and 400 cm−1using a
Bomem MB-100 Spectrometer. Test discs were prepared by mix-ing 1 mg of sample with 500 mg of KBr (Merck for spectroscopy)in an agate mortar and then pressing the resulting mixture at5 tons cm
−2for 5 min. The morphology of the AC opand methylene
blue adsorbed onto AC opwas examined by SEM (Shimadzu, model
SS 550). The surface of the AC opwas chemically characterized by
Boehm titration [29] and pH drift method [30].
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Isotherm data analysis
The values of the maximum adsorption amount ( Qm), correla-
tion coefﬁcient ( R2), and the other parameters for all the isotherms
are shown in Table 4 . The Langmuir isotherm assumes that adsorp-
tion occurs on a homogeneous surface containing sites with equalenergy and that are equally available for adsorption. This is valid
for the complete monolayer of adsorption, on which there is notransmigration of adsorbate on the surface plane. The Q
mvalue
of 874.68 mg g−1obtained for this isotherm is close to the exper-
imental value of Qm(890 mg g−1), and the value of R2of 0.9835
shows good ﬁtting of this isotherm to the experimental data(Fig. 2 a). The separation factor ( R
L), an important parameter of
the Langmuir isotherm, can be used to verify if the adsorptionin the system studied is unfavorable ( R
L> 1), linear ( RL= 1), favor-
able (0 < RL< 1), or irreversible ( RL= 0). In the concentration range
studied (100–1000 mg L−1), the values between 1.22 ×10−3and
1.22×10−4indicate favorable adsorption in the MB–AC opsystem.
The decrease in RLwith an increase in the initial concentration indi-
cates that the adsorption is more favorable at high concentrations(Fig. 2 b).
The Freundlich isotherm is an empirical equation that can be
used for heterogeneous systems with interaction between themolecules adsorbed. The n
Fparameter, known as the heterogene-
ity factor, can be used to indicate whether the adsorption is linear(n
F= 1), whether it is a chemical process ( nF< 1), or whether a
physical process is favorable ( nF> 1). On the other hand, the val-
ues of 1/ nF< 1 and 1/ nF> 1 indicate a normal Langmuir isotherm
and cooperative adsorption, respectively. The values of nF= 43.09
and 1/ nF= 0.023 indicate that the physical process and the nor-
mal Langmuir isotherm are favorable. The ﬁtting of the Freundlichisotherm to the experimental data ( R
2= 0.9828) is shown in Fig. 2 a.
Like the Freundlich isotherm, the Tempkin isotherm considers theinteractions between adsorbates assuming that the adsorption heatof all molecules decreases linearly when the layer is covered andthat the adsorption has a maximum energy distribution of uni-form bond. The constant b
Tis related to the heat of adsorption,
and the positive value found ( bT= 107.64) indicates an exothermic
process. The ﬁt to experimental data ( R2= 0.9144) in Fig. 3 a shows
that the Tempkin isotherm is less adequate to explain the adsorp-

tion of MB onto AC op, as compared to the Langmuir and Freundlich
isotherms.
The Harkins–Jura isotherm considers the multilayer adsorp-
tion, and it can be explained by the existence of a heterogeneouspore distribution. This isotherm ( Fig. 3 a) showed a low correla-
tion coefﬁcient ( R
2= 0.9496), just like the Tempkin isotherm. The
Jovanovic isotherm describes a model that is very similar to theLangmuir, considering a monolayer and no lateral interactions. Thevalues of Q
m(872.86 and 874.68 mg g−1for the Jovanovic and Lang-
muir isotherms, respectively) and R2(0.9836 and 0.9835 for the
Jovanovic and Langmuir isotherms, respectively) show the theo-retical similarities between these isotherms ( Fig. 3 a).The Redlich–Peterson isotherm was developed to improve the
ﬁtting between the Langmuir and the Freundlich equations. Thevalue of parameter g shows whether the Langmuir isotherm ( g=1 )
or the Freundlich isotherm ( g= 0) is preferable for the system. The
value of 0.98 (close to 1) found for gindicates that the Langmuir
isotherm is more appropriate. The Sips isotherm is a combina-tion of the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. At low adsorbateconcentrations, the Sips equation is reduced to the Freundlichequation. At high adsorbate concentrations, the equation providesfor the adsorption capacity in the monolayer that is typical ofthe Langmuir isotherm. The value of Q
m= 877.96 mg g−1found
for the Sips isotherm is slightly higher than the values of Qm

for the Langmuir and Jovanovic isotherms. On the other hand,
the Vieth–Sladek isotherm showed a Qmequal to 825.60 mg g−1,
which was the lowest value among the isotherms that allow cal-culating this parameter. The ﬁt of the Sips isotherm ( R
2= 0.9836),
the Vieth–Sladek isotherm ( R2= 0.9825), and the Redlich–Peterson
isotherm ( R2= 0.9830) to the experimental data is shown in Fig. 3 b.
The Toth isotherm is another empirical equation developed to
improve the ﬁt of the Langmuir isotherm and to describe het-erogeneous adsorption systems. Among all the isotherms studied,the value of Q
mequal to 889.58 mg g−1found in the ﬁt of the
Toth isotherm was the value closest to the experimental one of890 mg g
−1. This shows that the isotherm can be satisfactorily
used in the MB–AC opsystem. The Brouers–Sotolongo isotherm
shows a Qmvalue (872.86 mg g−1) that is equal to that of the
Jovanovic isotherm and close to the Langmuir isotherm value. Onthe other hand, the Q
mvalue equal to 848.72 mg g−1found for the
Radke–Prausnitz isotherm is lower than that found by the Tothand Brouers–Sotolongo isotherms. The ﬁts of the Radke–Prausnitz(R
2= 0.9835), Brouers–Sotolongo ( R2= 0.9836), and the Toth
(R2= 0.9836) isotherms to the experimental data are shown in
Fig. 3 c.
From the analysis of all the isotherms and the knowl-
edge of the most important parameters ( Qmand R2), the
isotherms can be arranged according to their capacity topredict or their efﬁciency in predicting the experimen-tal behavior of the MB–AC
opsystem. With respect to Qm
(in descending order): Toth > Sips > Langmuir > Jovanovic,
Brouers–Sotolongo > Radke–Prausnitz > Vieth–Sladek. Withrespect to R
2(in descending order): Sips, Jovanovic,
Brouers–Sotolongo, Toth > Langmuir, Radke–Prausnitz > Redlich–Peterson > Freundlich > Vieth–Sladek > Harkins–Jura > Tempkin.
The normalized standard deviations ( /Delta1q
e) measures the differ-
ences in the amount of dye taken up by the adsorbent predicted bythe models and the measured experimentally. According to Table 4 ,
the/Delta1q
evalues of isotherm models ranged from 1.22 to 6.73. The
Harkins–Jura and Tempkin models presented the lower /Delta1qe, such
as the lower R2values. Therefore, considering the high R2values
and /Delta1qevalue can be observed that the Toth model is the most
appropriated for the adsorption of the MB onto AC op.
Table 5 shows the maximum adsorption capacity ( Qm) for var-
ious adsorbents found in the literature. Several authors presentthis value in the experimental form or as the maximum adsorptioncapacity of the monolayer obtained from the Langmuir isotherm.All the values of Q
mfor the adsorption of MB are lower than the AC opvalue obtained for ﬂamboyant pods. The high value of Qmobtained
in this work is due to the microporous characteristic of AC op, which
has a BET surface area of 2854 m2g−1(Table 1 ).
In previous study [19], the ACs obtained from ﬂamboyant
pods presented the highest BET surface area value in compari-son to other ACs. According to the textural characterization ofthe AC
op(Table 1 ), the pore size distribution obtained by the
HK method showed that the majority of the pores have a diam-eter of 2.24 nm. Considering that the width of MB moleculedescribed by Pelekani and Snoeyink [31] is 1.43 nm, the ratio of
average diameter of the AC
op(2.24 nm) to the width of the MB
molecule could be calculated and the value of 1.57 was found.Though, the average pore diameter of AC
opcan accommodate only
one MB molecule, it has elevated porosity due the high surface areavalue. Therefore, the diffusion of MB from adsorbate solution to thepores of adsorbent may have been favored, which justiﬁes the highQ
mvalues.
3.2. Kinetic data analysis
The kinetic adsorption data can be processed to understand
the dynamics of the adsorption reactions in terms of the order ofthe rate constant. Since the kinetics parameters provide importantinformation for designing and modeling the adsorption process. It isimportant to point out that the initial MB concentrations employedduring the kinetic studies (800, 900, and 1000 mg L
−1) are very
high when compared with other studies reported. AC ophas a huge
adsorption capacity and adsorbs all MB when its initial concentra-tion are lower that 800 mg L
−1. The kinetic data were analyzed using
three different kinetic models: pseudo-ﬁrst order, pseudo-secondorder, and Avrami equation.
The pseudo-ﬁrst order model [4]is the earliest known equation
describing the adsorption rate based on the adsorption capacity.The pseudo-second order model [6,8] describe that adsorption pro-
cess is controlled by chemisorption which involve valency forcesthrough sharing or exchange of electron between the solvent andthe sorbate. The Avrami kinetic equation determines some kineticparameters, as possible changes of the adsorption rates in func-tion of the initial concentration and the adsorption time, as wellas the determination of fractionary kinetic orders [28]. The con-
formity between the experimental data and the model-predictedvalues was expressed by correlation coefﬁcients ( R
2). Besides the
R2values, the applicability of kinetics models was veriﬁed through
the normalized standard deviation ( /Delta1qe, %).
All kinetic parameters were calculated from ﬁts of the three
models ( Fig. 4 a–c), and they are showed in Table 6 . According to
Fig. 4 the models represent initial stages where a rapid adsorp-
tion occurs. The correlation coefﬁcients for the three kinetic models(Table 6 ) were greater than 0.9872, which led to believe that the
kinetic models provided good correlation for the adsorption to dif-ferent concentrations of MB onto AC
op. The /Delta1qevalues obtained
for the Avrami model was 2.92%, which was the lower comparedto the values of 3.05 and 7.70% obtained for the pseudo-ﬁrst orderand pseudo-second order kinetic models, respectively. Consideringthat the models presented high values of R
2, the applicability was
based on the lowest /Delta1qevalues, so the Avrami model was the most
suitable equation to describe the adsorption kinetics. Moreover, theexperimental q
evalues agreed with the calculated values obtained
from the no linear plots.
The equation of Avrami kinetic model presents Avrami expo-
nential that is a fractionary number related with the possiblechanges of the adsorption mechanism that takes place during theadsorption process. So the mechanism adsorption could followmultiple kinetic orders that are changed during the contact of theadsorbate with the adsorbent [28].A.M.M.

3.3. FT-IR spectra and SEM images of AC opbefore and after
adsorption of MB
Fig. 5 shows the FT-IR spectra for AC op, MB, and MB
adsorbed onto AC op. In the AC opspectrum ( Fig. 5 a), four
regions (1085–1306 cm−1, 1310–1448 cm−1, 1450–1674 cm−1,
3280–3647 cm−1) stand out due to the overlapping of several
bands. The bands between 1085 and 1306 cm−1correspond to the
angular deformation in the plane of C–H bonds of the aromaticrings (commonly appearing between 1300 and 1000 cm
−1), the
axial deformation vibrations of the C–O bond in phenols (com-monly appearing between 1260 and 1000 cm
−1), and the axial
deformation of the C–O bond of carboxylic acid (commonly appear-ing between 1320 and 1210 cm
−1)[32]. The small band between
1310 and 1448 cm−1was attributed to the interaction between
the O–H angular deformation and the C–O axial deformation inphenols (commonly appearing between 1260 and 1180 cm−1) and
the C–O–H angular deformation of carboxylic acid (commonlyappearing between 1440 and 1395 cm
−1)[32]. The bands between
1450 and 1674 cm−1correspond to the aromatic skeletal vibrations
involving the axial deformation of C–C bonds, which appear in theregions between 1600 and 1585 cm
−1and 1500 and 1400 cm−1.
According to Montes-Morán et al. [33], the bands observed in
the region between 1700 and 1500 cm−1were attributed to C C
symmetrical stretching of pyrone groups and C O of carboxylic
groups. The bands between 3280 and 3647 cm−1correspond to the
stretching of the O–H bond of free phenols or those that do not par-ticipate in hydrogen bonds (commonly appearing between 3700and 3584 cm
−1), phenols with intermolecular hydrogen bonds
(commonly appearing between 3550 and 3200 cm−1), and O–H
bond vibrations of carboxylic acid (commonly appearing between3400 and 2400 cm
−1)[34].

Fig. 5. FT-IR spectra of AC op(a), MB (b), and MB adsorbed onto AC op(c).
The spectrum of MB ( Fig. 5 b) shows several bands in the region
between 675 and 900 cm−1corresponding to axial-deformation
vibrations of the C–H bond in polynuclear aromatic rings. Dueto the presence of three condensed rings in the MB structure,the angular deformation bands in the C–H plane and the vibra-tions of C–C axial deformation for aromatic compounds, describedfor AC
op, also appear in this spectrum. The bands in the regions
1020–1250 cm−1and 1266–1342 cm−1were attributed to the axial
deformation vibrations of the C–N bond of aliphatic amines andto the axial deformation of the C–N bond of aromatic amines,respectively [32].
The spectrum for MB adsorbed onto AC
op(Fig. 5 c) shows new
bands when compared to the spectrum of AC opalone. We can
clearly observe the presence of the adsorbed dye as well as somebands previously described for AC
opand MB. It is important to
highlight that the band between 3300 and 3600 cm−1, attributed
to both phenolic groups and carboxylic acid, decreases in intensitybecause these groups interact with MB. For this reason, the bandbetween 1550 and 1650 cm
−1can be attributed to the asymmetric
axial deformation of the carboxylate anion, and the weaker band at1400 cm
−1can be attributed to the symmetrical axial deformation
of the same anion [32].
SEM analyses were performed with the purpose to conﬁrm
the adsorption of MB onto AC opsurface. Fig. 6 a and b shows the
SEM images of AC opsurface before and after the adsorption of
MB, respectively; where the observed differences in the reﬂec-tion of the images are due to the presence of MB which wasadsorbed.

3.4. Possible mechanisms of adsorption
According to Pelekani and Snoeyink [31], the width, depth, and
thickness of MB are equal to 1.43, 0.61, and 0.4 nm, respectively.These dimensions allow this dye to have easy access within theporous structure of AC
op, which has pores that are 2.24 nm in diam-
eter ( Table 1 ). In addition, the adsorption process is inﬂuenced by
substituent groups present in AC op. The presence of surface func-
tional groups plays an important role in the adsorption capacityand the removal mechanism of the adsorbates [13]. As demon-
strated by the Boehm method ( Table 1 ) and FT-IR analysis, the main
adsorption groups to be considered for the AC
opare carboxylic acid,
phenols, pyrones, and the aromatic structure of the graphene layer.On the other hand, due to the cationic properties of MB, its chargeis delocalized throughout the chromophoric system, although it isprobably more localized on the nitrogen atoms [3].Fig. 7 shows
the mechanisms that may happen in the process. The mechanismswere divided into electrostatic interactions (mechanism I), hydro-gen bonding formation (mechanism II), electron donor-acceptor(mechanism III), and /H9266–/H9266dispersion interaction (mechanism IV).
As the pH
drift for AC opis 2.01 ( Table 1 ), solutions with pH
between 6 and 7 favor electrostatic interactions between AC opand
MB, because when the pH solution >p H drift, the adsorbent acquiresA.M.M. Vargas et al. / Chemical Engineering Journal 168 (2011) 722–730 729

negative charges [30]. Furthermore, at neutral pH, there is no sig-
niﬁcant competition between the MB and the hydrogen ions for theadsorption sites.
According to mechanism I, the carboxylate anion (negatively
charged) of AC
opcan interact electrostatically with the positive
charge of nitrogen present in MB. Mechanism II involves the hydro-gen bonds, which are usually present in most adsorption systemsand are known as non-electrostatic. Mechanism III shows that thecarbonyl oxygen of pyrones present in AC
opcan act as electron
donors and the aromatic ring of MB, as an electron acceptor [35].
Pyrone groups show an increase in their basicity as more aromaticrings are added to their structure, turning them into a more polynu-clear structure [33]. This creates a negative charge in the ACs, which
also facilitates the interaction with positively charged adsorbates.Mechanism IV shows the /H9266–/H9266dispersion interaction between the
aromatic ring of MB and the aromatic structure of the graphene lay-ers[35]. Since most dyes used in the industry have aromatic rings
in their structures, this mechanism should also be considered in thestudy of adsorption processes. Based on the Boehm method resultsand the BET surface area of the AC
op, the mechanisms mentioned
earlier can present the following sequence of the importance: IV,I, III and II. The largest occurrences for the mechanism IV is due tofact that the basal plane of AC is constituted mainly of graphenelayers. The mechanisms I, III and II are related with the concentra-tion of functional groups carboxylic, pyrone and fenolic ( Table 1 ),
respectively, which are present in surface of AC
op.
4. Conclusions
ACopproved to be an effective adsorbent for removing
MB from aqueous solutions. For equilibrium studies, theisotherms were evaluated using parameters Q
m,R2, and /Delta1qe.
With respect to the best prediction of the Qmvalue, when
compared to the experimental value ( Qm= 890 mg g−1), the
isotherms followed the order: Toth > Sips > Langmuir > Jovanovic,Brouers–Sotolongo > Radke–Prausnitz > Vieth–Sladek. Withrespect to the best ﬁt ( R
2), the order was: Sips, Jovanovic,
Brouers–Sotolongo, Toth > Langmuir, Radke–Prausnitz > Redlich–Peterson > Freundlich > Vieth–Sladek > Harkins–Jura > Tempkin.
Equilibrium data were best described by the Toth isothermmodel with maximum adsorption capacity of 889.58 mg L
−1.
The maximum adsorption capacity for the AC opobtained on an
experimental basis was higher than several adsorbents reportedby the literature. The kinetic of the adsorption process wasfound to follow the Avrami kinetic model, which suggests thedetermination of fractionary kinetic orders. The functional groupspresent in the FT-IR spectra of AC
op, MB, and MB adsorbed onto
ACopallowed assessing the adsorption of MB, such as the SEM
images. The mechanisms of electrostatic interactions, hydrogenbonding formation, electron donor–acceptor, and /H9266–/H9266dispersion
interactions show the different interactions that may occur in theMB–AC
opsystem.
