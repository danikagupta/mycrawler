ABSTRACT : In this experiment,  use of electro fenton  process  for removal of COD (chemical oxygen 
demand) from real effluent  of dyes and dye intermediates was studied.  Purpose of this study is to 
determine the optimum value of current, optimum value of Ph , optimum time period & the optimum 
dosage of hydrogen peroxide an d ferrous ion for removal of COD (chemical oxygen demand)  from  
real  effluent of dyes and dye intermediates . From the results, it is suggested that Electro Fenton 
(EF) method can efficiently  used to degrade COD (chemical oxygen demand).  The best COD remov al 
efficiency obtained  was 85.33 %, when current value is 400 A, treatment time is 300 min and pH 
value is between 2 -3.5. The optimum dose of hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) is 1.5 ml/min. The optimum 
dose of ferrous ion (Fe2+) is 11000mg/L.

 1.INTRODUCTION  
A large volume of waste waters is produced by the Dyes and dye intermediate industry as they 
consumes  large amount of water in different steps in the dyeing process. Waste water from dyeing 
units requires proper treatment before releasing into the stream as is often rich in color, containing 
residues of reactive dyes and chemicals. The effluents generated  from different steps in the dyeing 
process are heavily colored; contain high concentrations o f salts, and exhibits high COD ( chemical 
oxygen demand) ,BOD( biological oxygen demand) values so Dyes are unfavorable from an 
ecological point of view. Due to th eir intensive color, high content of surfactants and other organic 
and inorganic compounds, a significant toxicity and poor biological recovery This wastewater is 
difficult to treat with the use of old physicochemical and biological methods. Alternative te chnology 
has been  developed  to help solving  the problem. The  develo pment of new treatment methods that are 
called advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), which are characterized by production of the hydroxyl 
radical (OH•) as a primary oxidant. The EF is one of the most effective methods of organic pollutant 
oxidation among various AOPs. Therefore, the Electro Fenton has been applied to treat a real waste 
water of dye and dye intermediate industry. There are two types o f electro -Fenton (EF) processes . In 
the first one the Fenton’s reagents (Fe (II) and H 2O2) are added to the reactor externally. In the second 
one, H 2O2 is added externally and Fe (II) is produced from sacrificial cast iron anodes.  
Mechanism Of Electro -Fenton Process  
Fenton reagent, mixture of hydrogen peroxide and iron (II) salt is discovered by Henry J.H. Fenton 
in 1890s that is used to destroy  organic compounds. The oxidation power of hydrogen peroxide on 
certain organic molecules is He described by him, in which under the addition of Fe (II) as a catalyst 
OH‾ radicals are produced from hydrogen peroxide. This system is considered as the most p romising 
treatment among AOPs for remediation of highly contaminated water.  
Oxidation of organic compound is faster in solution which contains H 2O2 and Iron (II) salts that 
form hydroxyl radicals in reaction:  
H 2O 2+Fe2+ → Fe3+ +OH–+HO• 
This reaction is used  for waste water treatment and it is most efficient at pH ranging from 2 -5, 
Molar H 2O2 to Fe2+   about 1:1.                              
Recently, the Fenton’s reagent has been produced in situ electrochemically (electro -Fenton) in two 
ways:                                                                                            
(a) by addition of a catalytic amount of Fe2+ ions, reduction of oxygen and regeneration of Fe2+ on a 
suitable cathode in acidic media:  
O 2+2H++2e-→H 2O 2 Eo = 0.67 V   Kothari et al RJLBPCS 2016         www.rjlbpcs.com         Life Science Informatics Publication s

 Fe3+ +e-→Fe 2+ E o = 0.771 V  
 
(b) by addition of H 2O 2 and electrochemical production of Fe2+ ions with a sacrificial Fe anode 
according to the anodic reaction:  
Fe→Fe2+ +2e- 
In this case, a part of Fe3+ ions is produced from Fenton’s reaction (3) between supplied H 2O 2 and 
electro regenerated Fe2+ which precipitates as Fe(OH) 3. 
Therefore, the organic pollutants can be removed by oxidation with OH* radicals and 
simultaneously by electro coagulation with the Fe (OH) 3 precipitate.

Figure shows the optimum treatment time for the removal efficiency of COD .The  best removal 
efficiencies were obtained when treatment time is 300 minutes. COD removal was achieved 84%. 
The results shows that when treatment time exceeds 300 minutes the removal efficiency of COD has 
decreased. Hydrogen peroxide is added in a single st ep and in a continuous mode with feeding time. 
This result in the increase of initial COD removal with the decrease in feeding time and it reach 
highest when hydrogen peroxide was applied all at once. Also that, the decrease of feeding time, the 
concentrat ion of hydrogen peroxide during the initial period would increase. This phenomenon will 
be more hydroxyl radicals would be generated resulting from the chain reaction between hydrogen 
peroxide and ferrous ion. the treatment time is to complete the oxidatio n reaction largely due to the  
dosage of H 2O2. In general, the time to terminate the electro -Fenton can vary significantly with the

 The H2O2 Dosage + Fe2+ Dosage  are an important factor in the electro -Fenton process. The results 
showed that the best removal efficiency of COD is obtained at 1.5ml/min dosage of  H2O2 + 600mg/l 
dosage of Fe2+ .Which is of 84% of COD removal. The increased of H 2O2 concentration ability to 
remove more pollutants in wastewater. Addition of H 2O2 results  in the increase in hydroxyl radical. As 
Fenton’s reagent dosage increases the efficiency of hydrogen peroxide for degrading organic 
pollutants in the sample decreases.  At the high dosage of H 2O2, the decrease in removal efficiency 
was due to the hydroxyl radical scavenging effects of H 2O2 and the recombination of the hydroxyl 
radical. efficiency. It is seen that, the removal efficiency were increased when the dosage has  been 
increased. However, a higher oxidant doses higher than optimum dose cannot provide adequate 
results. In electro -Fenton process, ferrous ion concentration is requirement to generate this process. 
The optimum Fe2+ concentration is 600 mg/L for 84% of C OD  removal respectively. Usually, the 
efficiency of electro -Fenton process increases with Fe2+ concentration because the concentration 
hydroxy radical. The main oxidizing agent (H 2O2) in the electro -Fenton process increases with the 
increase in Fe2+ conce ntration. The excess of ferrous ion use in the electrolyte solution can consume 
the hydroxyl radicals and affect the extent of degradation. After the electro -Fenton process the excess 
amount of Fe2+ / Fe3+ will be contamination for soil and groundwater bec ause the excess amount of 
Fe2+ / Fe3+ produces extra amount of sludge and increase total dissolved solids and electrical 
conductivity.  
4. CONCLUSION  
Use of electro fenton process for real effluent of dyes and dye intermediates  was studied in this 
Experiment. Optimum conditions for electro -Fenton process were found at current 400 A, treatment 
time 300 minutes, pH 3, H 2O2 dosage 1.5ml/min and Fe2+ dosage 125gm. Hence, electro -Fenton is 
recommended as a powerful technique for the removal of COD in effluent of dye & dye intermediate 
industry.
