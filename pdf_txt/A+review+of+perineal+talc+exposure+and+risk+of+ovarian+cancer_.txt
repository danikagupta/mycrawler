Perineal Powder Exposure and the Risk of Ovarian Cancer
Unda S. Cook,1 Mary L. Kamb,1-2 and Noel S. Weiss12
This case-control study evaluated the nsk of epithelial ovanan cancer associated with genital exposure to
vanous forms of powder application. Cases included all women aged 20-79 years in three counties of western
Washington who were diagnosed wrth borderline or invasive ovarian cancer from 1986 through 1988; 64.3%
of eligible cases were interviewed. A sample of similarly aged women who lived in these counties, identified
by random digit dialing, served as controls. The overall response among control women was 68.0%.
Information on powder application and other potential nsk factors was ascertained during the in-person
interview. Overall, ovarian cancer cases (n = 313) were more likely than controls (n = 422) to ever have used
powder (age-adjusted relative nsk (RR) = 1.5, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 1.1-2.0). After adjustment for age
and other methods of genital powder application (none vs. any), an elevated relative nsk of ovanan cancer was
noted only for women with a history of penneal dusting (RR = 1.6, 95% Cl 1.1-2.3) or use of genital deodorant
spray (RR = 1.9, 95% Cl 1.1-3.1) These results offer support for the hypothesis, raised by pnor epidemiologic
studies, that powder exposure from perineal dusting contnbutes to the development of ovarian cancer, and
they suggest that use of genital deodorant sprays may do so as well. Limitations of the present study include
the fairly low proportion of eligible women who participated and the potential differential recall of powder
usage. Am J Epidemiol 1997;145-459-65.
ovarian neoplasms; powders; talc
Studies documenting the migration of carbon parti-
cles and radioactive paniculate agents from the vagina
to the ovaries (1, 2), as well as those that have iden-
tified talc-like particles more frequently in ovarian
tumors than in normal human ovarian tissue (3), have
raised concern that genital powder exposure may in-
crease a woman's risk of developing ovarian cancer.
While the results of several epidemiologic studies
have suggested elevated risks for ovarian cancer
among women with genital powder exposures (4-11),
results have been inconsistent for particular methods
of powder application (12). In this population-based
case-control study, information on the method, dura-
tion, and frequency of powder application was col-
lected to evaluate the impact of genital powder expo-
sures on the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer.

Washington. Eligible case subjects included white
women diagnosed between January 1, 1986, and De-
cember 31, 1988, who resided in three counties of
western Washington (King, Pierce, and Snohomish
counties) and were 20-79 years of age at diagnosis.
After obtaining permission from their personal physi-
cians to contact the women and obtaining written,
informed consent, we successfully interviewed 329
(64.3 percent) of the 512 eligible case subjects. The
remaining 183 women were not interviewed because
of death prior to study contact (n - 104, 20.3 percent),
physician or subject refusal (n = 73, 14.3 percent),
and lack of success in locating the women {n — 6, 1.2
percent). Seven women whose self-reported race/
ethnicity was other than white and nine women with
unknown genital powder use were also excluded.
Thus, a total of 313 white women diagnosed with
borderline (n = 79) or invasive (n = 234) epithelial
ovarian tumors were available for analysis.
Women identified as control subjects for this study
were part of a larger control pool selected by random
digit dialing (13) for several studies of cancer in
women. Of the total 10,109 calls made by random
digit dialing, 5,853 (57.9 percent) were to nonresiden-
tial phone numbers, 3,830 (37.9 percent) were to res-
idential phone numbers, and 426 (4.2 percent) were to

numbers of unknown residential status; 3,604 (94.1
percent) of the 3,830 calls to residential households
were screened for eligible women who were age
matched, in 5-year age groups, to the combined female
cancer case group. Of the 721 women identified who
were eligible, 521 (72.3 percent) were successfully
interviewed after written, informed consent was ob-
tained. The overall response (random digit dialing
screening response multiplied by the interview re-
sponse) was 68.0 percent. Women who reported race/
ethnicity other than white (n — 28), age greater than
79 (n — 5), a history of bilateral oophorectomy
(n = 58), uncertainty concerning a history of bilateral
oophorectomy (n = 4), and unknown genital powder
use (n = 4) were excluded, resulting in a total of 422
white control women for analysis.
Information regarding genital powder exposures
was collected by structured, in-person interviews.
Women were queried about storing diaphragms in
powder, dusting perineal areas with powder after bath-
ing, powdering sanitary napkins, and using genital
deodorant sprays (which may contain aerosolized
powder). Those who answered affirmatively were
questioned further about the duration and frequency of
powder application and about the types of powder
applied. Powders were grouped into five categories:
cornstarch, talcum powder, baby powder, deodorant
powder, and scented body/bath powder. Information
on demographic characteristics, reproductive history,
medical and screening histories, smoking history, an-
thropometry, and birth control methods was also pro-
vided by the women. A calendar was used to record
major life events and enhance recall of past exposures.
Relevant study information was recorded only for
exposures that occurred prior to the diagnosis date of
cancer among the cases or the analogous reference
date among controls.
Logistic regression (EGRET version 26.6; Statistics
and Epidemiology Research Corporation, Seattle,
Washington) was used to determine odds ratios as
estimates of the relative risk for ovarian cancer asso-
ciated with genital powder application and 95 percent
confidence intervals (14). For all the relative risk es-
timates reported in the present analysis, women who
reported any method, type, or frequency of genital
powder application were compared with women who
stated that they had never applied genital powder in
any manner (154 ovarian cancer cases and 256 con-
trols). Trends were evaluated using the likelihood ratio
statistic (14).
First, the relative risk for ovarian cancer among
women who reported exclusive use of one of the four
methods of powder application was assessed (table 2).
Then, because many women used more than onemethod of powder application, the risk for ovarian
cancer among women who reported any use of the four
methods of powder application was assessed while
adjusting for the other methods of powder application
(table 3). Similarly, ovarian cancer risk by exclusive
and nonexclusive use of the type(s) of powder used for
perineal dusting, diaphragm storage, or on sanitary
napkins was assessed (table 4). To assess the impact of
genital powder exposure on the risk of specific histo-
logic categories of ovarian tumors (table 5), we
grouped borderline and invasive ovarian tumors ac-
cording to the following International Classification
of Diseases for Oncology histologic codes (15): serous
tumors (codes 8441, 8442, 8460, 8461, and 8462);
mucinous tumors (codes 8470, 8472, 8473, 8480, and
8481); endometrioid tumors (codes 8380, 8381, and
8560); and other tumors that included clear cell (code
8310), undifferentiated (code 8020), and unclassified/
other (codes 8010, 8050, 8140, 8240, 8260, 8440,
8450, and 9000). All relative risk estimates were ad-
justed for age. Further adjustment for education, in-
come, marital status, body mass index (weight (kg)/
height (m)2), oral contraceptive use, or parity did not
alter the estimated relative risks. Information on lac-
tation was not available. Separate analyses for women
diagnosed with invasive ovarian cancer and for those
diagnosed with borderline ovarian cancer produced
results very similar to those presented in tables 2-5.
RESULTS
Selected characteristics of ovarian cancer cases and
controls are presented in table 1. Less education, a
lower household income, and a higher body mass
index were more common among women with ovarian
cancer than among control women, but oral contracep-
tive use and having had a full-term birth were less
common.
Genital powder application was more common
among cases (50.8 percent) than controls (39.3 per-
cent) (table 2). There was an overall 50 percent ele-
vation in the risk for ovarian cancer associated with
the use of one or more of the four possible methods of
genital powder application (95 percent CI 1.1-2.0).
Among women who exclusively used a single method
of powder application, ovarian cancer risk was most
strongly elevated among those who dusted perineal
areas with powder after bathing (RR = 1.8, 95 percent
CI 1.2-2.9).
We further examined ovarian cancer risk among
women who reported application of genital powders
using each of the four methods, although not neces-
sarily exclusive use of any method (table 3). Perineal
dusting was associated with an increased risk of ovar-

ian cancer (RR = 1.6, 95 percent CI 1.1-2.3), al-
though there was no clear pattern of increasing risk
with increasing duration of use. When the small con-
tribution of perineal dusting after a hysterectomy or
tubal ligation was excluded from the analysis, our
relative risk estimates were nearly unchanged (data not
shown). In 1976, the cosmetic industry proposed vol-
untary guidelines to limit contamination of consumer
powders (16), and we attempted to evaluate ovarian
cancer risk associated with any perineal dusting in
1976 or before and with exclusive perineal dusting in
1977 or thereafter. Women with any perineal dusting
in 1976 or before had an elevated risk (RR = 1.8, 95percent CI 1.1-2.9), but we were unable to evaluate
exclusive perineal dusting in 1977 and thereafter since
only four cases and 10 controls had this exposure. The
use of genital deodorant sprays was also associated
with an elevated ovarian cancer risk (RR = 1.9, 95
percent CI 1.1-3.1), with the strongest elevation in
risk among the small number of women {n — 15) who
used these sprays for more than 1 year (RR = 2.7, 95
percent CI 1.1-6.6). Storing a diaphragm in powder or
powdering sanitary napkins was not related to the risk
of developing an ovarian tumor (RR = 1.0, 95 percent
CI 0.6-1.6, and RR = 0.9, 95 percent CI 0.5-1.5,
respectively).

No specific type of powder used for perineal dust-
ing, diaphragm storage, or on sanitary napkins was
strongly related to ovarian cancer risk, although there
was a suggestion of an elevated risk associated with
any use of talcum powder and bath/body powders
(RR = 1.6, 95 percent Cl 0.9-2.8, and RR = 1.5, 95
percent Cl 0.9-2.4, respectively) (table 4). When spe-
cific histologic categories of ovarian tumors were ex-
amined, any genital powder application was associated
with an elevated risk for serous tumors (RR = 1.7, 95
percent Cl 1.1-2.5) and the nonspecific category of
other tumors (RR = 1.8, 95 percent Cl 1.1-2.8),
whereas no elevation in risk was noted for the small
number of women with mucinous tumors (RR = 0.7,
95 percent Cl 0.4-1.4) or endometrioid tumors (RR =
1.2, 95 percent Cl 0.6-2.3) (table 5).
DISCUSSION
There are several issues that should be considered in
the interpretation of our results. A sizable number of
women eligible for our study did not participate, par-
ticularly among those with ovarian cancer. Many
women with cancer died before they could be ap-
proached about participation in this study, and others
were too ill to participate. If substantial differences in
powder use existed between participating and nonpar-
ticipating women, our study results may over- or un-
derestimate the true risks for ovarian cancer. It is also
possible that the completeness of the reporting of
powder use differed between cases and controls, bias-
ing our relative risk estimates to some degree.
Additionally, it is not clear how well ascertainment
of perineal powder application correctly estimates ac-
tual exposure to particles in powder that may influence
ovarian cancer risk. Different consumer brands of
powder that women used, or even different lots of the
same brand, may have varied substantially in the con-tent of talc, asbestiform minerals, or structurally sim-
ilar compounds. Powder content has also varied over
time, presumably with fewer asbestiform minerals
present in more recently manufactured products (17-
19).
Our results suggest that a history of perineal dusting
or use of genital deodorant sprays has a modest influ-
ence on the development of epithelial ovarian tumors,
whereas storing a diaphragm in powder or powdering
sanitary napkins does not. Direct comparisons of our
results with those of the other nine published studies
(and among these studies) are somewhat limited be-
cause of differences in the definitions, groupings, and
analysis of genital powder use. Nonetheless, there is
some consistency in results among studies. Seven
studies including the present one (4, 6, 8-11) reported
elevated relative risks for ovarian cancer, ranging from
1.3 to 3.9, among women with powder exposure by
"dusting of the perineum." Of the three remaining
studies that evaluated the more general exposure of
"talc use in genital/perineal area" (which may or may
not include perineal, sanitary napkin, diaphragm, or
undergarment applications), two observed a modest
elevation in ovarian cancer risk (5, 7), whereas one did
not (20).
Most studies including the present one have found
little, if any, excess risk for ovarian cancer among
women who stored their diaphragms in powder (4-8,
10); only one study has reported a suggestion of an
elevation in risk (11). In the present study, control
women more frequently reported washing their dia-
phragms prior to use than did ovarian cancer cases, but
ovarian cancer risk was not substantially elevated for
the small number of women who did not wash their
diaphragms prior to use. The relation between pow-
dering sanitary napkins and ovarian cancer risk is less
clear; three studies including the present study found

no association (6, 10), whereas three other studies
reported moderate elevations in risk (4, 8, 11).
Only two other studies have evaluated particular
types of powder; one reported an excess risk of bor-
derline ovarian tumors among women who used de-
odorant powders (8), and another study reported an
excess risk of ovarian cancer among women who used
baby powders (10). A strong relation between the
types of powder used and ovarian cancer risk was not
found in the present study, although there was a sug-
gestion of an elevated risk with any use of talcumpowder and bath/body powders among women using
these powders for perinea] dusting, diaphragm storage,
or on sanitary napkins.
The present study is the first to evaluate the associ-
ation between genital deodorant spray use and ovarian
cancer risk; these preliminary results require confir-
mation in other studies. It is difficult to postulate that
an increased risk for ovarian cancer may specifically
be due to powder and associated -constituents when
some of the deodorant sprays do not contain aerosol-
ized powder. It is possible that it is not powder per se

t Other tumors include 17 clear cell, three undrfferentJated, and 83 unclassified (adenocaranoma or
unspecified carcinoma) tumors
but other unidentified chemical substances present in
deodorant sprays that may influence the development
of ovarian cancer.
A partner's use of condoms that were packed in talc
could also have contributed to a woman's genital
powder exposure (21). There was insufficient infor-
mation in the present study to address the influence of
condom use on the risk for ovarian cancer. Seven (2.2
percent) ovarian cancer cases and 19 (4.5 percent)
control women reported a history of exposure to con-
doms packed in talc, whereas 20 (6.4 percent) cases
and 34 (8.1 percent) controls did not know if their
partners had used condoms packed in talc. Further-
more, few women knew or remembered the brand of
condoms their partners had used.The specific constituent(s) of powders that may
influence the development of ovarian cancer is un-
known, although attention has been focused on fibrous
talc particles and asbestos (17-19, 22). Talc, a hydrous
magnesium silicate, is a constituent of almost all body
and baby powders except for those that are specifically
labeled as talc free or pure comstarch. The nonfibrous,
sheet-like layers of talc in these powders slide across
each other, allowing a smooth application on the skin.
Talc-based powders may also contain fibrous parti-
cles, most of which are talc fibers, but some can be
asbestiform fibers (17, 18). While pure talc is rela-
tively nontoxic, adverse health effects can include
induction of talc granulomas when introduced in open
wounds and, in the occupational setting, pneumoconi-

osis (talcosis) in individuals with long-term exposure
to talc dust (19). Occupational exposure to talc does
not appear to increase the risk for pulmonary malig-
nancies (19). Most animal studies confirm this, with
lung tumors developing only in rats exposed to doses
of talc dust high enough to cause chronic obstructive
and restrictive lung toxicity (19). Excess ovarian tu-
mors have not been reported in rats and mice with
long-term exposure to aerosol talc (23). In contrast,
occupational exposure to asbestos fibers has been
shown to cause lung tumors (24) and has been asso-
ciated with the development of ovarian tumors (25).
Thus, while there is little biologic or experimental
evidence to support a role for talc per se in the devel-
opment of ovarian malignancies, the potential biologic
effects of consumer powders (with their variable con-
stituents) on the human ovary have not been well
studied.
The prevalence of genital powder exposure re-
ported among control women in this and other studies
conducted in the United States ranges from 28 percent to
51 percent (4-6, 8, 10). Given such a common prac-
tice, even the modest elevation in ovarian cancer risk
associated with genital powder application suggested
by most of the epidemiologic studies could have a
notable impact on the incidence of ovarian cancer in
the United States. We recommend that cohort studies
address this question; these studies could eliminate
concerns regarding the potential differences in the report-
ing of genital powder exposures between cases and con-
trols. We also believe that further characterization of the
constituents of powder products that may influence ovar-
ian cancer risk and the investigation of their possible
biologic mechanisms of carcinogenesis are warranted.
