PHOTOCATALYTIC ACTIVITIES TOWARD DEGRADATION OF E 131 VF 
Georgette Charbel Estephane, Mouhiaddine Mohamed El Jamal
ABSTRACT
Ag-doped TiO2 nanoparticles are prepared by the wet impregnation method with a variable M/TiO2 mole ratio 
between 0.4 % and 5 %. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy techniques 
are used to characterize the samples. The results show that the rutilation is negligible despite calcinations at 500oC. 
The materials catalytic activity in respect to the food colorant E 131 VF photodegradation is evaluated. It is shown that the catalytic system advanced provides E 131 VF degradation with no adsorption on TiO
2 surface. In general, 
the enhancement of TiO2 photoactivity is slight after doping with Ag metal. The enhancement caused by addition of 
Ag (I) to TiO2 is largely inhibited by the particles agglomeration caused by the impregnation technique.

INTRODUCTION
The removal of color from the wastewater coming 
from different industries is a current issue of discussion 
and regulation all over the world [1]. Several studies 
on the physical, chemical and biological degradation of dye containing wastewater have been reported in the literature [2]. A heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation process has been recently used as a promising technol -
ogy for the removal of toxic organic and inorganic contaminants from industrial wastewater by completely 
destroying the organic contaminants to CO
2, H2O and 
mineral acids [3]. TiO2 is broadly used as a photocatalyst 
because of its nontoxicity, a photochemical stability, and 
a low cost [4]. When TiO2 is irradiated with ultraviolet 
(UV) light, an electron is promoted from the valence band to the conduction band resulting in the generation of a positive hole (h
+) at the valence band and the release 
of an electron (e-) in the conduction band. The electrons and the positive holes can recombine with each other within the crystal. The charges created can react with the adsorbed substances that can accept or donate electrons. Thus, the electrons can reduce an acceptor, while the positive holes can oxidize a donor. The free electrons react with the adsorbed oxygen to form superoxide radi -
cal anions (O
2•-): 
O2 (ads) + e-
(CB) → O2•−
(ads)
In the presence of adsorbed protons, the superoxide 
anion can lead to the formation of a hydroperoxide radi-cal (HO
2•) and then hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which 
can decompose on the catalyst surface to a hydroxyl radical (OH
•) under the action of radiation, or by reac-
tions with O2•- :
O2•-
(ads) + H+
(ads) → HO2•
(ads) 
HO2•(ads) + e-
(CB) + H+
(ads) → H2O2 (ads)
H2O2 (ads) + hν → 2OH•
(ads)
H2O2 (ads) + O2•- → OH•
(ads) + OH-
(ads) + O2 (ads)
while the energized holes react with water (H2O) or Georgette Charbel Estephane, Mouhiaddine Mohamed El Jamal927organic compounds to form hydroxyl radicals (OH•): 
H2O (ads) + h+
(VB) → OH•
(ads) + H+
(ads)
In turn, the generated species (OH•, O2•-, R•) are very 
reactive and can oxidize the compounds present leading 
to their mineralization. 
The rapid recombination of the electron-hole pair 
limits also the efficiency of TiO2 because it contributes 
to the loss of the reactive species cited above. Therefore, the modification of TiO
2 aiming to improve its photocata-
lytic efficiency is one of the most important objectives of the photocatalysts studies [4, 5]. In particular, the noble metal-modified semiconductor nanoparticles have be-
come the focus of many studies aiming to maximize the 
photocatalytic reactions efficiency. Because the Fermi levels of these noble metals are lower than those of TiO
2, 
the photoexcited electrons can be transferred from the conduction band of TiO
2 to the metal particles deposited 
on the surface of TiO2, while the photogenerated holes 
in the valence band remain on TiO2 [6]. This reduces 
greatly the possibility of electron-hole recombination resulting in efficient separation and higher photocatalytic activity. In addition, the photoelectrons can enhance the 
rate of oxygen photoreduction and favor the generation 
of hydroxyl radicals, thereby contributing to more effec-tive organic pollutant photoelimination [7]. The effects of silver and palladium on the photocatalytic removal of organic substrates have previously been described in the literature [8-17]. The activity of the metal-modified materials depends on the nature of the organic compound 
as well as on other factors which include the pollutant 
concentration, the pH value, the metal type and its load, as well as the adsorption rate of the pollutant [8, 18]. The literature shows that small amounts of silver or pal-ladium on the surface of TiO
2 enhance its photoactivity 
in respect to the decomposition of several pollutants when compared to that of bare TiO
2 [8, 9, 12, 15, 16]. 
However, sometimes the photocatalyst surface modifica -
tion by deposition of Ag [19, 20] and Pd [21] can have no significant effect on its photoactivity.
The aim of this work is to study the effect of Ag 
deposits on a TiO
2 catalyst type P25 in respect to the 
photodegradation of the food colorant E 131 VF. The studied catalysts are obtained by wet impregnation of the carrier by AgNO
3 solutions of a varying Ag/TiO2 molar ratio between 0.4% and 5%. The effect of the calcina -
tions temperatures on the obtained catalysts efficiency is also considered.
EXPERIMENTAL
 Materials and preparation
The TiO
2 nanoparticles (P25, ca 80 % of anatase, 
20 % of rutile; a particle size of ca 21 nm; BET area of 
ca. 50m2 g−1) were supplied by Sigma Aldrich. The food 
colorant E131VF was also obtained from Sigma Aldrich (C
27H31N2O6S2-Na, purity of 50 %, MW of 565.67 g). 
The aqueous stock solutions containing the food color -
ant were prepared, protected from light, and stored at an ambient temperature. The experimental concentration 
of the dye was selected so that its absorbance followed 
the Beer’s law (A
640:1.6). AgNO3 (99 %) was supplied 
by BDH.  
Preparation of the photocatalysts
Ag-doped TiO2 were prepared by the wetness im-
pregnation method according to the procedure described 
in ref. [2]. Calculated amounts of AgNO3 were added to 
TiO2 in order to get Ag/TiO2 molar ratio of 0.4 %, 0.8 
%, 1 %, 1.2 %, 1.6 %, 2.5 % and 5 %. Then 100 ml of distilled water were added to each sample and stirred for 8 h at a room temperature. After maturation within 
12 h, the solutions were dried at 100
oC for another 12 
h prior to grinding and calcinations (successively at 
300oC, 400oC and 500oC) for 4h in a muffle furnace. 
For comparison purposes, a bare support TiO2 P25 was 
also ground and calcined under identical conditions in order to be used as a reference sample. The prepared catalysts were named xAg/TiO
2y (x and y stood for the 
Ag/TiO2 molar ratio and the calcination temperature, 
correspondingly).  
Characterization of the photocatalysts
The X-ray diffraction pattern was recorded on D8 
Focus, Bruker, X-ray diffractometer operating at 50 kV 
using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.541 Å). The measurement was performed over a diffraction angle range of 2θ = 5°- 80°. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was applied on Jasco FT/IR- 6300 spectrometer in the wavelength range of 400 cm
–1 - 4000 cm–1. The FTIR Journal of Chemical Technology and Metallurgy, 54, 4, 2019928study was performed by using KBr pellet. The Raman 
spectra were recorded on Horiba Scientific operating with green Laser at 532 nm.  The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken with Ametek 
materials analysis division (AIS 2300C series) instru-
ment (a working distance of 25 mm, voltage of 20 kV). The EDX spectra were recorded in the binding energy region of 0 keV - 8 keV .Photocatalysis experiments
All prepared catalysts were grinded with an agate 
mortar before the photoactivity investigation. Prior to 
illumination commencement, a suspension containing 
0.08 g of the catalyst and 100 mL of an aqueous solution of E 131 VF were stirred continuously for at least 15 min in dark. Then the sample was irradiated under magnetic stirring by two UVB lamps (λ
max 320 nm) positioned 
at 10 cm above the glass bowl (a photoreactor from Luzchem LZC-4V , Canada). To quantify the decrease of the food colorant concentration with time, a sample of 3 
ml was taken (with a pipette) at predetermined intervals 
of time and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min in order to be analyzed by a double beam UV-visible spectro-photometer measuring the absorbance at the maximum wavelength of E 131 VF (640 nm).  RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCatalysts characterization
The XRD diffraction patterns of calcined P25, Ag 
doped TiO
2 show five primary peaks at 25.3◦, 38◦, 48.2◦ 
and 62.5◦ which can be attributed to different planes of 
pure anatase. Other peaks at 27.36o, 36o, 54o and 69o 
can be referred to pure rutile form of TiO2 (P25) [22]. 
The anatase reflections are dominating in the reflection patterns but rutile is also present as the original material (TiO
2, P25) contains both phases. The strongest peak 
at 2θ = 25.3◦ is representative for (1 0 1) anatase phase 
reflections (Fig. 1). These results show that the XRD patterns of all solids almost coincide with that of the original material P25, which is an indication that the 
structural integrity of the support is retained after metal 
doping [23] under the work conditions used.
It is seen that the calcination temperature increase 
up to 500
◦C does not significantly increase the effect 
of rutilation. Furthermore, there are no obvious peaks showing the presence of silver in the XRD samples even at Ag/TiO
2 molar ratio of 7.5 %. This indicates that the 
Ag particles are well dispersed on TiO2 surface. Hence, 
these metal sites are expected to be below the visibility limit of X-ray analysis. 
Fig. 1. XRD patterns of the calcined TiO2 and Ag/TiO2.Georgette Charbel Estephane, Mouhiaddine Mohamed El Jamal929The FTIR spectra of Ag/TiO2 show that all solids 
present FTIR spectra almost similar to that of P25; the 
peaks observed at 476 cm-1 and 620 cm-1 are assigned to 
the vibrations of Ti–O and Ti–O–Ti framework bonds of 
TiO2 [24]. The broad peaks at 3420 cm-1 and the peak at 
1620 cm-1 are characteristic of the H–O bending mode of 
the hydroxyl groups present on the surface of the catalyst due to moisture (Fig. 2a). As the amount of Ag salt added is small, no new band and no shift are observed in the 
bands of bare TiO
2 after doping. This supports the fact 
that an efficient dispersion of the doping ion is achieved. The Raman spectra (Fig. 2b) show that both P25 
and calcined TiO2 powders are in an anatase phase 
[25]. Besides, no secondary peaks related to the doped 
metals or their oxide phases are detected. This fact is in an agreement with the XRD and FTIR results obtained. 
The position of the Raman bands near 144 cm
-1 shifts 
towards higher wavenumbers with increase of Ag/
TiO2 molar ratio. Such phenomenon has already been 
observed by Choudhoury et al. [26] who report broad-ness and shifting to a higher wavenumber in case of Cu loading of TiO
2 nanoparticles. They suggest that this

Fig. 3b. EDX spectra of TiO2 300 and 1.6 % Ag TiO2 300.Journal of Chemical Technology and Metallurgy, 54, 4, 2019930phenomenon is related to the doped metals ionic size. 
The doping of Cu2+ of an ionic size (0.73 Å) larger than 
that of Ti4+ (0.64 Å) contributes to the distortion of the 
lattice structure of TiO2 and the formation of O2 vacan-
cies. Their explanation can be taken into consideration in view of the fact that Ag
+ has an ionic size of 1.26 Å, 
which is larger than that of Cu2+. Parker and Siegel show 
[27] that the oxygen vacancies are responsible for the shifting and the broadening of the Raman peak. 
The SEM images of the original pure TiO
2 P25, the 
calcined TiO2 and the 1.6 % Ag doped catalysts calcined 
at 300◦C and 400◦C are presented in Fig. 3a. The typi-
cal SEM images show that pure TiO2 P25 has uniform 
and smooth particles. They increase in size after TiO2 
treatment at 300◦C due to agglomeration. The presence 
of Ag does not contribute to significant modifications of the morphology and the particle size of TiO
2 calcined at 300◦C. However, the increase of the calcination tem -
perature from 300◦C to 400◦C increases further, although 
slightly, Ag/TiO2 particles size. 
The EDX spectra confirm the presence of Ag in the 
doped catalysts (Fig. 3b). For both catalysts, the intense peak at 4.51 keV is assigned to bulk TiO
2, while the less 
intense one is attributed to surface TiO2 [28, 29]. The 
peak of Ag is located at 2.9 keV . Sixteen zones of 1.6 Ag/TiO
2 are analyzed. The ratio of Ag/TiO2 % varies 
between 1.4 and 2.4, which means a uniform distribution of iron on TiO
2 (Fig. 4).
Photocatalytic activity
The photocatalysis experiments take place in an 
aqueous solution of the food colorant to evaluate the effect of doped Ag on TiO
2 activity. The photocatalytic 
activity of all solids is evaluated on the ground of the time variation of E 131 VF absorption at 640 nm (λ
max).
Blank experiments are carried out (i) in absence of 
a photocatalyst under UV irradiation and (ii) on a bare P25 support in dark to verify E131 adsorption on TiO
2. 
In absence of a photocatalyst, the absorbance de-
creases nearly 10 % after UV irradiation for 30 min (13 % after 2 h, 20 % after 4 h). So there is a negligible 
degradation of E131 in absence of a catalyst. In presence 
of a bare P25, the absorbance value of the food color -
ant solution after stirring in dark for 20 min (and even longer) decreases little (< 6 %) which shows that E131 is very weakly adsorbed on the surface of P25 TiO
2.Fig. 4. Variation of the 1.6 Ag/TiO2 % ratio as function

Fig.5b. Variation of the A640 as function of time in the presence P25, TiO2 300 and 1.6 Ag/TiO2300.Georgette Charbel Estephane, Mouhiaddine Mohamed El Jamal931However, in presence of both P25 catalyst and 
UV irradiation, there is a fast decrease of A640 which 
means a fast degradation of E 131 VF. This highlights 
the importance of using TiO2 photocatalyst (k1: 0.17 
min-1 - 0.18 min-1). Furthermore, as the adsorption of E 
131 VF on P25 is negligible, it can be accepted that the photodegradation of the colorant can occur (in absence of adsorption phenomenon of the food colorant on TiO
2 
surface) in the solution, i.e. in the zone around the pho-tocatalyst particles through interactions with different radicals such as OH•, O
2•- and R•. There is a decrease 
of the whole spectrum during the experiment. Amax of 
E131 shows a slight hypsochromic shift during the pho-todegradation (Fig. 5a). No new absorption bands appear in the UV-Vis spectrum of the colorant. This result is in 
accordance with that obtained by Chen [30].
The kinetic study of the degradation of E 131 on Ag/
TiO
2 samples is illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6. The results 
show that the process of P25, calcined TiO2, and Ag 
doped TiO2 catalysts follows the pseudo first order (Fig. 
5b). A similar order value is obtained with the samples 
treated at 400oC and 500oC.
There is a slight increase of the photocatalytic 
performance of Ag/TiO2300 samples (k1: 0.16 to 0.2 
min-1, see Fig. 6) when compared to that of the calcined 
undoped TiO2 300 (0.1min-1 - 0.11min-1) (Fig. 5). But 
the further increase of Ag/TiO2 molar ratio up to 7.5 % 
results in a considerable efficiency decrease (the result is not shown). The recalcinations of the same catalysts at a higher temperature (400
◦C) do not show any significant change of the catalysts activity. I.M. Arabatzis et al. [31] report that the decrease of Ag/TiO
2 efficiency with 
increase of Ag+ ion concentration is due to shading of 
the available semiconductor surface by the silver layer. 
In most studies, the authors ascribe the catalytic per -
formance to the adsorption factor of the pollutant on the 
catalyst [8, 20]. For example, the study of Hoang Tran 
et al. [8] shows that the silver deposits have a negligible effect on the mineralization of the organic compounds. They report that the alcohols do not benefit by the pres-ence of silver due to their limited adsorption on TiO
2. 
Moreover, the active part of a photocatalyst is its 
illuminated zone being in contact with the organic pol-lutant [31]. As P25 particles are smooth and soft, they 
are well dispersed in the liquid reaction medium, which 
in turn increases the surface area available for photon absorption and subsequent free radicals liberation. But in case of Ag/TiO
2 samples, the particles agglomerate. 
This may explain their slight sedimentation even with stirring and their poor dispersion in the solution. This phenomenon abates the illuminated surface of the metal 
doped catalysts in comparison to that of P25 and as a re -
sult decreases the amount of the free radicals responsible 
for the degradation of E 131VF in the solution. Khaki et al. [32] show that there is an optimal temperature for doped-TiO
2 calcination beyond which the photocatalytic 
activity may be reduced due to particles agglomeration decreasing the specific surface area of the photocatalyst. Thus, the present work focused at the photocatalytic deg-
radation of E 131 VF in an aqueous suspension explains 
the slight increase of Ag/TiO
2 catalyst photoactivity by 
the presence of two opposite phenomena: 
The presence of Ag on the surface of TiO2 decreases 
the recombination rate of e- - h+ leading to an increase 
of the bare catalyst photoactivity.
The agglomeration of Ag/TiO2 particles upon cal -
cination results in a decrease of the area exposed to radiation, and consequently in a decrease of the active radicals produced.
CONCLUSIONS
The present work describes the preparation of 
Ag/TiO2 catalysts by impregnation and the study 
of the effect of TiO2 doping on the photocatalytic Fig. 6.  Variation of the rate constant K1 (min-1) as function 
of the Ag/TiO2 %.
Journal of Chemical Technology and Metallurgy, 54, 4, 2019932degradation of E 131 VF. The catalysts calcination 
at 300oC and 400oC contributes to a significant ag-
glomeration of the particles of the bare and doped TiO
2, whose size increases unlike the uniform and 
smooth particles of pure TiO2 P25  Degussa. It is 
found that the samples containing a small amount of Ag/TiO
2 have a slight positive effect on the photo-
catalytic activity of TiO2 when treated at 300oC. It is 
also found that the photodegradation of the colorant can occur not through adsorption phenomena on TiO
2 surface but in the solution by interaction with 
the different radicals produced. The catalytic results obtained provide the suggestion that in a liquid sus-pension reaction medium there is a close relationship 
between the particles size of the catalyst (which 
maintains its dispersion in the reaction medium) and the degradation rate of the pollutant. The addition of Ag to TiO
2 does not present an important positive 
effect with respect to the catalytic performance of P25 due to the problem (agglomeration) caused by the impregnation method.
