In an earlier paper (1) a study was reported of the antibody content, in 
weight'units, of the sera of human volunteers at varying intervals from 2 weeks 
to 2 years after injection of pneumococci or of the specific polysaccharides of 
two or three pneumococcal types. On the basis of this study and of earlier, 
less precise investigations an experiment was undertaken looking toward im- 
munization against Types I, II, V, and VII pneumococci of incoming trainees 
at an army camp at which lobar pneumonia was endemic. The epidemiological 
results of subcutaneous injection of trainees with the specific polysaccharides of 
Types I, II, V, and VII pneumococci have been published (2). Analyses of 
ser~ of randomly selected subjects who had participated in this experiment 
have now been completed, and the data are submitted herewith. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
The sera of two groups of subjects were analyzed: Group 1: Randomly selected trainees 
(roughly 1 out of every 300) were bled to the extent of 30 to 50 ml. (0 bleeding) and then 
injected subcutaneously with 1.5 ml. of a solution containing about 0.03 mg. each of the 
specific polysaccharides of Types I, II, V, and VII pneumococci per ml. About 2 months 
later as many as possible of these men were again bled (bleeding 1). Two bleedings were ob- 
tained and analyses were completed in nineteen instances. Group 2: Bleedings were collected 
similarly, but the subjects were injected with 1.5 ml. of salt solution. The sera of this group 
were studied in order to determine whether or not such exposure to pneumococcal infection as 
might have occurred in normal contacts during the 2 months' period was sufficient to induce 
the formation of measurable antibodies to the four pneumococeal types studied. This group, 
therefore, served as an analytical control to the other group. Analyses were completed in 
ten instances in group 2. 
All analyses were carried out according to (3) as given in detail in (1). As previously 
emphasized, it is usually necessary to allow each set of analyses to stand 8 days in the cold 
to complete the separation of the small amounts of specific precipitate ordinarily formed. If

sufficient antibody is present for the precipitates to form within 24 or 48 hours the analyses 
may be run after this interval, with addition of further small portions of polysaccharide to the 
supernatants. Since a series of successive analyses is required, precautions to ensure sterility 
are essential. Analyses were usually carried out in the order anti-C, anti-I, II, V, and VII, 
with such repetitions as were found necessary. In many instances several absorptions with 
C-substance were required, particularly when the amount of anti-C present was relativdy 
large. Numerous absorptions with S VII were found necessary with postimmunization sera, 
the amount of precipitate often increasing to a maximum and slowly decreasing with successive 
additions of 0.01 rag. of S VII. The precipitates were sterile and appeared to be the result of 
interaction between S VII and antibody. Absorption of the preliminary bleedings with S 
VII, on the contrary, presented no difficulties. 
DISCUSSION 
In SO far as comparable, the limited series of analyses given in Table I re- 
sembles those presented in the earlier study (1). A disappointing difference 
is the poor antibody response to S V, since appreciable amounts occurred in only 
four of nineteen subjects as opposed to eighteen of twenty in the earlier series. 
The same lot of polysaccharide was used in both instances, but it remains un- 
certain whether the antigen had deteriorated or whether the poorer response was

due to the variability of the human material. If the latter alternative be as- 
sumed, the relative inability to form antibody did not extend to its elaboration 
against Types I, II, and VII, for most of the subjects reacted well to the in- 
jection of the specific polysaccharides of these types. If the sera of these men 
were, as believed, representative of the entire group of nearly 9,000 injected 
with the polysaccharide mixture, the antibody response to these three types was 
adequate to explain the favorable results of the field test (2). 
Since pneumococcal pneumonias of Types I, II, V, and VII were endemic at the 
camp during the period covered by the analyses in Table I, it was of interest to 
analyze sera of trainees injected only with salt solution, since it was possible that 
all subjects might show an increase in antibodies to these pneumococcal types 
during the 2 months in question. Analyses were completed on the sera of ten 
subjects and these failed to show any differences in the negative or minimal 
quantities of type-specific antibodies found at the beginning or end of the period. 
Details of the analyses (group 2) are on file but are not given here. 
As in the earlier study, individual values for anti-C content were usually 
similar in the two bleedings. The average values of anti-C in group 1 were: 
bleeding 0, 25 ~g. per 4 ml. of serum; bleeding 1, 27 ~g. In group 2, (injected 
with saline) the figures were 47 and 44 #g. 
Also as previously noted, the initial sera often contained antibodies to S VII, 
the average for group 1 being 4 #g. per 4 ml., with a range from 0 or 1 (eight 
instances) to 14 #g. A relatively high initial content of anti-VII was not nec- 
essarily followed by a maximal antibody response on injection of S VII. The 
analytical values for anti-VII in group 2 were similar to those for group 1, with 
no change in bleeding 1, 2 months after the injection of physiological saline. 
SUM'~4RY 
1. Random selections of the sera of trainees injected 2 months previously 
with the specific polysaccharides of Types I, II, V, and VII pneumococci 
contained quantities of antibody to Types I, II, and VII sufficient to account 
for the favorable results of the immunization procedure. 
2. As in earlier studies, the levels of the antibody for the C polysaccharide 
remained relatively constant before and after the injections. 
3. The serum from the preliminary bleedings often contained antibody to the 
Type VII polysaccharide. This remained relatively constant in a control 
group injected with saline.
