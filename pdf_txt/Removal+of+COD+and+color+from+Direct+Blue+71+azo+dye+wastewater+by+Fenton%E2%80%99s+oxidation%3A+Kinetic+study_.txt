ColorAbstract In this paper, degradation of Direct Blue 71 (DB71) by Fenton’s oxidation process was
investigated. The effect of initial pH, dosages of Fe2+and H 2O2, dye concentration and temperature
on the color and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal was studied in a batch reactor. The opti-
mal conditions for the decolorization and COD removal of DB71 were determined as pH = 3.0,Fe
2+= 3 mg L/C01and H 2O2= 125 mg L/C01. Under the optimal conditions 94% color and 50.7%
COD removal efﬁciency of the dye in 100 mg L/C01aqueous solution were achieved after 20 min of reac-
tion. Results indicated that the removal efﬁciency was strongly dependent on initial pH, initial con-
centration of Fenton’s reagents, initial DB71 concentration and reaction temperature. Additionallyincreasing the reaction temperature from 20 to 60 /C176C showed a positive effect on the decolorization
efﬁciency of DB71. The experimental data were analyzed using the ﬁrst and second-order and Behnaj-
ady–Modirshahla–Ghanbery (BMG) kinetic models. BMG model provides the best correlation of thedata. The present study can provide guidance to relational industry operators and planners to effec-
tively treat the DB71 contaminated wastewater by Fenton’s oxidation process.

1. Introduction
Approximately 80% of all reactive dyes are based on azo chro-
mogen ( Su et al., 2011 ). Azo dyes are characterized by the nitro-gen double bond (–N ‚N–) which together with other
chromophores is responsible for the color ( Idel-aouada et al.,
2011; Ameta et al., 2012 ). Azo dyes are typically used in textile
processing and paper manufacturing industries. A massive
amount of azo dyes from these sources is discharged into naturalwaterways ( Su et al., 2011 ). All these different sources of water
pollution contain hazardous mixtures which come from organic
and inorganic pollutants in addition to heavy metals which haveadverse effects on the environment, aquatic life and human
health. Earlier investigations revealed that more than 25% of
the total world population suffers from health and hygienicproblems related to water pollution ( Soon and Hameed,
2011). Removal of dyes from industrial efﬂuent is environmen-*Corresponding author. Tel.: +90 442 2314606; fax: +90 442

hazardous substances, because most of them are toxic and
considered to be resistant to biodegradation. Traditionally,
the treatment of solutions containing soluble dyes is per-formed by biochemical and coagulation processes. All these
methods are either costly, inefﬁcient or result in the produc-
tion of secondary toxic waste products. Recently, advancedoxidation processes (AOP) have received considerable atten-
tion because it is possible to degrade organic compounds
and color from wastewaters ( Schrank et al., 2007; Chanderia
et al., 2017 ). Fenton process as an important AOP technol-
ogy has been attracting growing interest. It is well known
that /C5OH radicals can be produced by Fenton’s reaction of
H
2O2with Fe2+and Fe3+salts as presented in the follow-
ing equations.

The generated/C5OH radical is a powerful oxidant and starts
a cascade of oxidation reactions that can convert the organic
matter in solution completely into water, carbon dioxide,and inorganic compounds ( Han et al., 2011 ). By tailoring the
conditions of the reaction,
/C5OH radicals which possess power-
ful oxidizing potential up to +2.8 V can attack a wide variety
of toxic contaminants ( Soon and Hameed, 2011 ).
The main objective of this work is to determine the inﬂu-
ences of various parameters on the degradation of DB71 dye
by the Fenton process in aqueous solution. The effect of pH,the concentration of H
2O2,F e2+and dye and the temperaturewere investigated to determine the optimal operating condi-
tions for a better performance of the degradation. COD ofthe mixture was determined.
2. Materials and methods
Solutions of DB71 dye (C
40H23N7Na4O13S4, Aldrich) of differ-
ent concentrations were prepared in distilled water.
Then, they were homogenized by stirring until completely
dissolving the dye. The pH of the reaction mixture was ad-
justed by adding sulfuric acid and was measured by a pH-me-
ter (330i WTW 82362, Weilheim). The dye oxidation wasachieved by Fenton’s reagent which was composed of a mix-
ture of FeSO
4.7H 2O and H 2O230% (products Riedel-de
Hae¨n). The necessary quantities of Fe2+and H 2O2were added
simultaneously in the dye solution. The experimental device
was constituted of a perfectly agitated reactor in which a vol-
ume (500 ml) of solution was studied. The maximum absor-bance wavelength ( k
max) of DB71 was found to be 587 nm.
The kinetics of the oxidation was followed by taking samples
at regular time intervals. The residual concentration of the
dye in the solution at different times of sampling was deter-mined by UV Visible spectroscopy. COD was determined
(Merck Spectroquant TR320) by a closed reﬂux colorimetric
method according to Standard Methods for the Examinationof Water and Wastewater ( APHA, 1985 ). The amount of
H
2O2causing enterprise in COD analysis was subtracted from
the amount of COD determined by using the I/C0
3method ( Kang
et al., 1999 ). The chemical structure of DB71 is shown in Fig 1
(Saien and Soleymani, 2007 ).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Effect of Fe2+dosage
The/C5OH radicals are trapped by Fe2+ions in excess as shown
in the reaction (4)(Bouasla et al., 2010 ). To see the effect of
Fe2+dosage in the Fenton process and to determine the most
appropriate concentration of Fe2+, a series of experiments
were conducted at different concentrations of Fe2+from 0
to 5 mg L/C01.H2O2concentration was 50 mg L/C01at an initial
pH of 3.0. As shown in Fig. 2 ,F e2+concentration was

pH = 3.0, T=2 0/C176C, COD o= 139.9 mg L/C01,t= 20 min).Removal of COD and color from Direct Blue 71 azo dye wastewater by Fenton’s oxidation: Kinetic study S11590m gL/C01and only 31.1% color and 22.4% COD were re-
moved when H 2O2alone was used. The addition of Fe2+
would increase color and COD removal in the presence ofH
2O2. It is because Fe2+ions react with hydrogen peroxide
generating more and more/C5OH radicals which remove the
dye by degrading it into smaller molecules ( Fu et al., 2010 ).
However, removal efﬁciency would decrease when Fe2+addi-
tion was higher than 3 mg L/C01. It can be seen from Fig. 3 that
the optimal dosage was 3 mg L/C01of Fe2+(73% color and
32.5% COD removal). This is possibly due to the reactionleading to the Fe
2+and/C5OH recombination. Therefore, the
oxidation of organic pollutants was hindered at high Fe2+
concentration ( Li et al., 2009 ).

3.2. Effect of H 2O2dosage
Fig. 3 shows the removal of color and COD at different (0, 25,
50, 75, 100, 125 and 150 mg L/C01)H2O2dosages. The pH was
kept at 3.0 and the Fe2+was 3 mg L/C01. In the presence of
H2O2, the color removal increased from 35.7% to 94% and
the COD removal increased from 22.1% to 50.7% as theH
2O2dosage increased from 0 to 125 mg L/C01, respectively.Since the high level of decolorization is much easier to achieve
than the high level of mineralization, the effect of processparameters on mineralization aiming to ﬁnd optimal condi-
tions was investigated ( Papic et al., 2009 ). However, removal
efﬁciency would decrease when H
2O2addition was higher than
125 mg L/C01. According to the reaction (1), the concentration
of/C5OH is expected to increase with increasing H 2O2dosage,
leading to increased oxidation rates of organic compounds.However, as mentioned above, excess H
2O2interferes with
the measurement of COD. The residual H 2O2in the Fenton
process can consume K 2Cr2O7, leading to the increase of inor-
ganic COD ( Kang et al., 2002 ). Additionally above the limiting
point,/C5OH efﬁciently reacts with H 2O2and produces HO 2/C5.
HO 2/C5radicals are less reactive than/C5OH, increasing HO 2/C5re-
sults in negligible contribution ( Schrank et al., 2007 ).

3.3. Effect of pH
The actual dye wastewater has a wide range of initial pH val-
ues, and the solution pH is an important operating parameter
affecting DB71 removal efﬁciency in AOP. It affects directlythe mechanism of oxidation dye, because a change in pH of
the solution, involves a variation of the concentration of
Fe
2+, and therefore the rate of production of/C5OH radicals
responsible for oxidation dyes, will be restricted ( Bouasla
et al., 2010 ). The effect of pH value on the DB71 color and
COD removal was assessed at ﬁve initial pH values, 2.0, 3.0,4.0, 5.0 and 6.0. From Fig. 4 , initial pH value of the solution
was remarkably inﬂuenced the color and COD removal. When
pH was 3.0, the color removal was 94% and the COD removalwas 50.7%. The reaction rates of Fenton oxidation of the dyesare rather slow in alkaline medium while they are fast in acidic
medium ( Gul and Ozcan-Yıldırım, 2009 ). In a study, the high-
est yield was obtained at pH 3.0 by the Fenton’s oxidation pro-cess ( Kavitha and Palanivelu, 2005 ).
3.4. Effect of initial concentration of dye
Initial concentration of dyes is an important parameter in
practical application. The effects of initial dye concentrations

t= 20 min).S1160 N. Ertugay, F.N. Acarmoval efﬁciencies of DB71 were evaluated at 125 mg L/C01H2O2
and 3 mg L/C01Fe2+at pH 3.0. As shown in Fig. 5 , the color
and COD removal efﬁciency gradually decreased with an in-
crease in the initial concentration. This is due to non-availabil-ity of sufﬁcient number of hydroxyl radicals. The presumed
reason is that when the initial concentration of DB71 is in-
creased, the
/C5OH concentration is not increased correspond-
ingly. However, the higher the concentration, the more the
dye decolorized in 20 min. This happens because the increase
in concentration enhances the interaction between the dyeand
/C5OH ( Wu et al., 2010 ).
3.5. Effect of temperature
The effect of temperature at 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 /C176C on DB71
degradation was investigated. It can be seen from Fig. 6 thatincreasing temperature had a positive effect on the DB71 deg-
radation. The efﬁciency of color and COD removal of DB71
were increased from 94% to 99.0% and from 50.7% to
65.0% when the temperature increased from 20 to 60 /C176C,
respectively. Temperature affects the reaction between H 2O2
and Fe2+. This can be explained by the fact that Fenton’s reac-
tion could be accelerated by raising the temperature which im-proved the generation rate of
/C5OH and therefore enhancing the
decolorization of DB71 ( Emami et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2009 ).
3.6. Kinetic experiments
In the present study, ﬁrst-order, second-order and BMG reac-
tion kinetics were used to study the decolorization kinetics ofDB71 by the Fenton oxidation process. The individual expres-
sion was presented as equations given below:

The regression analysis based on the ﬁrst and second-order
reaction kinetics for the color of dye was conducted and the re-sults are shown in Fig 7 andTable 1 . As seen in Table 1 , as dye
concentration increases from 50 to 150 mg L
/C01, the second or-
der model rate constants increase from 0.7904 to 0.9201 min/C01.
However, the ﬁrst order model rate constants decrease from0.1733 to 0.0757 min
/C01. The second order kinetics shows high-
er correlation than the ﬁrst -order kinetics in the case of the
Fenton reaction.

The obtained parameters for DB71 are given in Table 1 and
Fig 8 . As it can be seen from Table 2, the values of correlation
coefﬁcient values for BMG model are mostly higher than those
of the ﬁrst-order and the second-order models. Generally, cal-
culated regression coefﬁcients ( R2) of the BMG kinetic model
were higher than 0.99. Therefore, BMG kinetic model is the
best model to describe the decolorization of DB71 by the Fen-
ton’s process ( Tunc et al., 2012 ).
3.7. Spectral changes in the UV–vis absorption spectra of dyes
during Fenton process
Typical scanning-kinetic outputs obtained during the decolor-
ization process of 60 mg L/C01DB71, 1.5 mg L/C01Fe2+,
50 mg L/C01H2O2, pH = 3.0 at 20 /C176C for 20 min are shown in
Fig. 9 . As seen from Fig. 9 , prior to the initiation of decolor-
ization reactions in the solution, the maximum absorption
wavelengths of DB71 are at 587 nm, in the visible region. This
absorption band observed due to the n ﬁp*transition corre-
sponds to the chromophore containing azo linkage (–N ‚N–)
in the azo dyes. Benzene and naphthalene rings in the DB71
lead to the two absorption bands in the ultraviolet region lo-cated at 210 and 290 nm owing to the pﬁp
*transition. The
amount of diminution in the absorption peak located at
587 nm is much higher than those at 210 and 290 nm. Theseresults indicate that the
/C5OH radical, produced from Fenton re-
agent, ﬁrst attacks the azo groups of the dye molecules since
the absorption energy values of the n ﬁp*transitions are
much lower than those of the p*ﬁp*transitions and opens
the –N‚N– bonds. In the case of DB71 decolorization process
(Fig. 9 ), the intensity of the absorption peak in the visible

during the Fenton’s process (C o=6 0m gL/C01,
H2O2=5 0m gL/C01,F e2+= 1.5 mg L/C01, pH = 3.0, t= 20 min).S1162 N. Ertugay, F.N. Acarregion observed at 587 nm displays a sharp decrease with
increasing time, especially in the ﬁrst 5 min, unlike the otherpeaks of DB71 in the ultraviolet region. This means that the
–N‚N– bonds in the DB71 molecule are destroyed more than
the benzene and naphthalene rings ( Tunc et al., 2012 ).
4. Conclusion
The treatment of a solution containing DB71 by the Fenton
oxidation process has been taken into consideration in thisstudy. The experimental results show that the initial concentra-
tion of H
2O2,F e2+, DB71, the initial pH, and the temperature
had great inﬂuence on the degradation of DB71 dye by theFenton’s process. The optimal values of operating parameters
during the oxidation of the DB71 dye by the Fenton’s process
are Fe
2+= 3 mg L/C01,H 2O2= 125 mg L/C01, pH = 3.0 and
increasing temperature had a positive effect on the DB71 deg-radation. As is known, complete decolorization of the dye does
not mean that the dye is completely degraded, so the degrada-
tion of DB71 in terms of COD removal was also investigated.As can be seen from the Figs, COD values decreased with opti-
mum parameters. The initial COD of 139.9 mg L
/C01DB71 was
68.9 mg L/C01, after treatment by AOP. This is because the inter-
mediate products of DB71 by AOP are difﬁcult to oxidize, and
complete oxidation may proceed in a longer time. The BMG
kinetic model provided the best correlation of the used exper-imental data compared to the pseudo-ﬁrst and second-order
kinetic models. Spectral analyses have indicated that the
destruction rate of the azo linkage in the azo dyes during theFenton process is higher than that of benzene and naphthalenerings.
This process can be used to treat water discharge containing
dyes such as DB71. The Fenton process is very suitable for thetreatment of colored waters, very effective and less expensive
than conventional processes.
