Biological methods are widely used to treat dye waste, particularly methyl orange (MO) dye. The importance
of MO degradation stems from its classi ﬁcation as a toxic dye. Within the scope of this research, successful
bio-decolorization of MO was achieved through the use of Ralstonia pickettii bacteria immobilized in
a PVA –alginate –hectorite matrix (BHec-RP). The optimum conditions for the degradation were observed
at a composition of PVA (10%), hectorite (1%), static incubation, 40 °C, and pH 7. Subsequently, the
adsorption kinetics of BHec-RP (dead cells) as well as the degradation kinetics of BHec-RP (live cells)and MO using free R. pickettii cells were evaluated. The decolorization of MO using BHec-RP (dead cells)
is an adsorption process following pseudo- ﬁrst-order kinetics (0.6918 mg g
−1beads) and occurs in
a monolayer or physical process. Meanwhile, the adoption of BHec-RP (live cells) and free R. pickettii
cells shows a degradation process under pseudo- ﬁrst-order kinetics, with the highest rates at an initial
MO concentration of 50 mg L−1being 0.025 mg L−1h−1and 0.015 mg L−1h−1, respectively. These
results show that the immobilization system is superior compared to free R. pickettii cells. Furthermore,
the degradation process shows the inclusion of several enzymes, such as azoreductase, NADH-DCIP
reductase, and laccase, presumed to be included in the fragmentation of molecules. This results in ﬁve
fragments based on LC-QTOF/MS analysis, with m/zvalues of 267.12; 189.09; 179.07; 169.09; and 165.05.
Introduction
The global production of synthetic dyes is estimated to reach 7
×105tons per year for nine groups of dyes, namely acid, basic,
mordant, sulfur, dispersion, reactive, direct, vat, and azo dyes.1
Among these dyes, azo dyes (R0–N]N–R00) constitute the
dominant group, representing approximately 70% of the totalcolorants.
2,3Synthetic dyes are used in various industrial
sectors, including textiles, pharmaceuticals, printing, paper,food, leather, and laboratories, as indicators and stains forbiological specimens.
4–6The extensive use of synthetic dyes is
consistent with the ease of water contamination. This in u-
ences the increase in chemical oxygen demand (COD),biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), as well as dissolved andsuspended solids. Under anaerobic conditions, microorgan-isms can metabolize dyes, producing toxic intermediateproducts.
7Methyl orange (MO) is an azo dye identi ed to
produce intermediate products such as aromatic amines,including N,N-dimethyl benzyl-1,4-diamine, sulfonamide, and
1,4-diaminobenzene.
8,9These products are reported to be highly
toxic due to their transformation into mutagenic, carcinogenic,and teratogenic species.
8,10 –12Additionally, synthetic dyes have
the potential to induce damage to the vital organs of humans
and animals, including the kidneys, digestive system, brain,liver, skin, and central nervous system.
1,13,14
Various methods, such as occulation, adsorption, coagu-
lation, sedimentation, ultra ltration, electrolysis, ion exchange,
and plasma, have been used to eliminate dye fromsolutions.
15–20However, the complete decolorization of dye has
not been achieved due to its intricate molecular composition
and the presence of toxic byproducts.21,22Many microorgan-
isms, including bacteria,23fungi,24and yeast,25have shown their
ability to remove the color from azo dyes through bio-absorption,
26degradation,27and mineralization.28Among these
microorganisms, bacteria have been proven to play a crucialrole in the treatment of wastewater containing dyes.
13,29 –31
Extensive research has shown the ability to e ﬀectively remove
dyes. However, the use of free cells in the biodegradationaDepartment of Chemistry, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS), Surabaya,

process is limited by reaction rates, operational instability, dye
toxicity, and ine ﬃciency in transferring substrates.32To address
these issues, immobilized cells have been developed as anappropriate method in the eld of biodegradation. These cells
tend to show high enzymatic activity and greater resistance tovarious environmental disturbances, such as changes in pH,high concentrations, and inhibitory ions.
12,33Additionally,
immobilized cells are more advantageous regarding oxygensupply, mass transfer, and repeated use.
12,34
A PVA–alginate mixture is the main supporting material for
cell immobilization, widely applied.35–38This is preferred
because the mixture can form perfectly round beads, possessstrong mechanical characteristics, and stabilize cells. However,the polymer results in a denser surface for the beads, limitingmass transfer within the system. Some studies found thatadding a small amount of alginate to the PVA gel-makingprocess improved the tissue structure and enhanced the mass
transfer of the carrier.
39,40However, the polymer mixtures still
show high density, in uencing cell viability and pollutant
degradation rates.41This limitation can be addressed by adding
adsorbents such as kaolin clay,32,36bentonite,37and diatoma-
ceous earth40into the PVA –alginate gel. Lin et al.41reported that
adsorbents enhanced the mechanical properties of the gel,providing pores and acting as an adhesive medium thatenhanced microbial stability.
1,40,41A potential adsorbent is
hectorite, which has a structure and composition similar to
those of bentonite and kaolin. This adsorbent shows biocom-patibility in the PVA –alginate mixture, is non-toxic, hydrophilic,
and provides large pores.
2,3,42Therefore, hectorite can be used
as the base material for bacterial cell immobilization toenhance the rate of pollutant degradation.
The bacteria immobilized on PVA –alginate –hectorite is Ral-
stonia pickettii . This is the rst report of R. pickettii immobili-
zation for MO degradation. The ability to degrade dyes and
other toxic pollutants such as methylene blue,
43DDT (1,1,1-tri-
chloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane)44–46and crude oil47has
been stated. The degradation of MO as a model pollutant wasevaluated under various parameters, such as PVA content,hectorite content, pH, and temperature. The immobilizationcarrier material enhances the adsorption and degradation rates.Additionally, the physical characterization of the beads, the
enzymes, and the prediction of the MO degradation pathway
were reported.

Regeneration and production of R. pickettii for
immobilization
Bacterium culture R. pickettii NBRC 102503 was maintained on
nutrient agar and incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours. The colonywas inoculated into 10 mL of LB broth in an Erlenmeyer ask,
and the cultures were pre-incubated at 37 °C for 30 hours witha shaker of 120 rpm. In addition, the inoculum size was xed to
optical density 1.0 ( l
max=600 nm, 1.50 ×106cells per mL).
Synthesis of hectorite
Hectorite-CTAB was synthesized using the method described by
Asranudin.2,3In this synthesis, 40% CTAB was added to the
LiCl : Mg(OH) 2: SiO 2(1.33 : 5.00 : 7.60), and the resulting
mixture was subjected to calcination at 550 °C in a nitrogenenvironment for 1 hour. This was followed by exposure to air for4 hours, and the calcined hectorite was mixed with PVAhydrogel, sodium alginate (SA), and R. pickettii cells.
Batch experiments and analysis methods
Factors in uencing the biodegradation of MO in BHec-RP were
investigated. Experiments were conducted using variousconcentrations of PVA, namely 2.5%, 5.0%, 7.5%, 10%, and
15% (w/v), as well as hectorite, including 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, and
4% (w/v). This mixture contained 1% (w/v) alginate, and the R.
pickettii pellets were regenerated to an optical density of 1.0
(l
max=600 nm, 1.50 ×106cells per mL). The experiments were
performed in triplicate and incubated in a stationary incubatorunder dark conditions. MO concentration was monitored for upto 48 hours, and the PVA –alginate –hectorite –RP hydrogel was
dropped into a mixture of H
3BO3solution (3% b/v) and CaCl 2
(4% b/v) using aseptic syringes. The mixture was stored for 12hours to obtain hardened gel beads with a diameter ofapproximately 3 –5 mm. The beads were washed three times
with demineralized water to remove residual CaCl

beads are denoted BHec-RP, and an illustration of the fabrica-
tion is shown in Fig. 1.
Adsorption and degradation kinetics of methyl orange (MO)
The adsorption and degradation kinetics were determined
using dead and live cells in BHec-RP. The reactions were carriedout in 100 mL Erlenmeyer asks containing 2.5 g of beads and
25 mL of MSM solution, with a nal MO concentration ranging
from 50 to 300 mg L
−1. The decolorization was performed at 40 °
C under static conditions. Furthermore, the degradation
kinetics using free R. pickettii cells were also studied for
comparison. The residual MO concentration was determinedusing UV-vis spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 465 nmbased on eqn (1).

addition, the reusability and stability tests of BHec-RP (livecells) against MO were conducted for a total of 8 cycles andstored for 50 days.
Enzyme analysis and identi cation of metabolite products
Crude enzyme extract was obtained by centrifuging the decol-
orization media at 4000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 minutes. The ob-
tained ltrate was tested for enzyme activity and adopted for
total protein analysis using the Bradford method.
48The
enzymes analyzed were NADH-DCIP reductase,49azor-
eductase,50and laccase.51
The identi cation of metabolites a er decolorization was
determined using Q-TOF LC/MS (Bruker). A 50 mL aliquot of thecell culture medium was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15
minutes, and the collected supernatant was extracted with ethyl
acetate. The extract was dried using a rotary vacuum evaporatorand re-dissolved in ethanol for further analysis. The elutionmethod used a gradient of 0.2 mL min
−1for the rst three
minutes and 0.4 mL min−1for the subsequent seven minutes.
The mobile phase used was methanol and water, with a ratio of99 : 1 (v/v) for the rst 3 minutes and 61 : 39 (v/v) for the
following seven minutes. This analysis used an Acclaim TM
RSLC 120 C18 column (2.1 ×100 mm) at a temperature of 33 °C.
Various tools, including ChemDraw Ultra 12, MZmine3, andPathPred ( https://www.genome.jp/tools/pathpred/ ), were used
to determine the logic of metabolite fragments.Characterization
Beads BHec-RP before and a er application have been charac-
terized using relevant instruments. Morphological analysis andelemental composition were determined using SEM-EDX(Hitachi, FlexSEM 1000). Before characterization, BHec-RP wasfreeze-dried at −50 °C for 8 hours. Thermal analysis of BHec-RP
was performed using TGA/DTG (Hitachi High-Tech Sciences
STA7200 Simultaneous Thermal). The sample was heated from
28 to 900 °C at a rate of 10 °C min
−1under a 60 mL min−1
nitrogen stream. In addition, the surface and pore area of BHec-
RP were analyzed through the Quantachrome Touchwin v1.11instrument. The sample was degassed at 300 °C for 3 hoursunder a vacuum, and N
2gasowed at −196 °C. The speci c
surface area and the pore size distribution were calculatedusing BET (Brunauer –Emmet –Teller) and DFT (Density Func-
tional Theory).
Results and discussion
Characterization
Scanning electron microscope. SEM images of BHec (No
Cell), BHec-RP, Hec-40, and TEM of Hec-40 are shown in Fig. 2.Dry BHec and BHec-ARP beads have a diameter of ∼5 mm, as
shown in Fig. 2a and b. The enlarged part of the beads on theright shows that the surface morphology of hectorite beads
diﬀers from the powder form due to the intercalation of PVA
and alginate.
52BHec and BHec-RP report the presence of
a network con rming the encapsulation of hectorite in alginate.
Asranudin et al.3stated that the successful intercalation of
hectorite in alginate resulted in a network-like morphology ofits beads. The morphological di ﬀerence between BHec and
BHec-RP is the presence of R. pickettii on BHec-RP, appearing as
round shapes attached to the network. Hec-40, the morphology
of hectorite containing 40% CTAB before calcination, shows

aer calcination, showing a silicate layer characteristic.53
Furthermore, elemental analysis of BHec, BHec-RP, and Hec-40
is presented in Table 1. The di ﬀerence in composition between
these two beads is that BHec does not contain the element N.The presence of N in BHec-RP beads is due to R. pickettii .
Additionally, the weighted C value increases signi cantly with
the presence of bacteria in the beads, reaching 10.27%. Hec-40
does not contain C and N since these elements are lost during
calcination.
The analysis of the morphology of BHec-RP beads before and
aer decolorization and BHec-RP (dead cells) a er adsorption
as control beads is shown in Fig. 3. Furthermore, the elementalanalysis of BHec-RP is presented in Table 2. The interactionbetween MO and BHec-RP is con rmed through SEM images
and elemental mapping using EDS, as presented in Fig. 3. These
results depict the morphology of beads before (Fig. 3a) and a er
(Fig. 3b) application and those containing dead cells (Fig. 3c).The characterization shows that the PVA –alginate –hectorite
mixture used as a supporting material allows e ﬀective trapping
ofR. pickettii cells, preventing any suspension detected in the
decolorization media. Furthermore, live cells are visible in thebeads in Fig. 3a and b, forming hanging spheres. This charac-teristic of R. pickettii is similar to that of E. aerogenes NBO2 and
L. plantarum CM53, which form in the tissue of alginate
beads.
54,55The condition shows that the cells are protected and
well-trapped in the supporting matrix. The composition of theimmobilization carrier material can preserve cells and enzymesfrom environmental changes and denaturation. Furthermore,
EDS analysis shows di ﬀerences in the elemental composition
between Fig. 3b and c. The sulfur content in Fig. 3b is lowerthan in Fig. 3c, showing MO adsorption. In comparison, in
Fig. 3b, the content is presumed to be desulfonated by bacterial
activity. The carbon is also higher in Fig. 3b and c, 19.79% and18.58%, due to the adsorbed MO molecules on the beads'surface.
Thermal analysis
The thermal stability of the hectorite calcined sample (Hec), BHec
(PVA–alginate –hectorite), and BHec-RP (PVA –alginate –hectorite- R.
pickettii ) was analyzed using TGA/DTG, as shown in Fig. 4. The
thermogravimetric calcined hectorite (Hec) analysis showeda typical weight loss in two decomposition stages.
56Therst
weight loss appeared at temperat ures below 200 °C, associated
with the dehydration of physically absorbed water on the surface
of hectorite.57In this context, hectorite is a hydrophilic material
with a high tendency to absorb water within its layers and surface.The second decomposition stage at ∼731 °C is related to the
dehydroxylation within the structure.
58The DTG peak for the
Hec-calcined sample was observed at the same temperature.Moreover, BHec and BHec-RP beads showed di ﬀerent decompo-
sition stages. The rst decomposition was shown below 200 °C, as
well as at ∼290 °C and ∼430 °C. The decomposition at ∼250 °C
and∼430 °C shows that the degradation of PVA and alginate
polymers occurs in multiple stages between 200 –400 °C and
500–650 °C. This data suggests that BHec remains stable at high
temperatures, allowing for mechanical stability.

pores that enhance mass transport into and out of BHec.Furthermore, Hec and BHec-RP samples show hysteresis loopsin the range of 0.50 –0.90 ( P/P
0), consistent with the character-
istics of Type IV isotherms and mesoporous materials. The beadsamples show smaller hysteresis loops with lower V
adsop values.The surface area ( SBET) and Smeso of BHec-RP beads are lower
than Hec, attributed to the intercalation of PVA and alginate
species occupying the interlayer surface of hectorite.42Accord-
ing to the NLDFT method, the SBETandSmeso for Hec and BHec-
RP samples are 224.21 m2g−1, 22.40 m2g−1, and 217.45 m2g−1,
20.31 m2g−1, respectively. The pore diameter of BHec-RP is
smaller than that of Hec, measuring 3.82 nm and 7.75 nm,respectively. This data shows that hectorite contributes to thepores and surface area in BHec-RP. The surface of area, pore
diameter, and volume of Hec and BHec-RP samples are
summarized in Table 3.
MO degradation using immobilized and free cells
The comparison of MO degradation using immobilized, steril-
ized immobilized, and free cells is shown in Fig. 6. The highesteﬃciency is achieved by BHec-RP and free cells a er 30 and 48
hours of degradation, respectively. Therefore, R. pickettii cells
can eﬀectively degrade MO in immobilized and suspended
states. The role of bacteria is evident when compared to BHec-RP beads (dead cells), which only achieved a decolorization of
24%, and the decolorization is an adsorption process. Rapid
equilibrium is reached at 12 hours, showing that MO is adsor-bed on the surface of the beads. In contrast, BHec-RP (live cells)and free R. pickettii show equilibrium a er complete decolor-
ization at 30 and 48 hours. BHec-RP (live cells) quickly reachesequilibrium because MO has been adsorbed since the earlystages of interaction. Based on the decolorization pro le, the
adsorption and degradation processes occur simultaneously,
resulting in a shorter time. In free R. pickettii , from 2 to 12
hours, only less than 30% is decolorized. Dye degradation usingfree cells is slow in the rst 12 hours, and the cells are in an
adaptation phase. Therefore, it is insu ﬃcient to adsorb and
produce enzymes optimally. The toxicity of pollutants may leadto the cells adapting over time.
36,41,59,60Similar conditions were
reported in the decolorization of crystal violet using free cells ofBurkholderia vietnamiensis C09V, where immobilized cells
decolorized faster.

Adsorption kinetics and MO degradation
In Fig. 6, the removal of methyl orange using immobilized cells
resulted from MO rst adsorbing onto beads and then degra-
dation by the immobilized cells. Hence, adsorption (dead cells)and biodegradation kinetics (live cells) are investigated in thissection to further con rm the mechanism.
Adsorption kinetics
Inuence of contact time and initial concentration. The
adsorption kinetics and degradation of MO were investigated inthis section to con rm the occurring mechanism at 40 °C, pH 7,
a volume of 25 mL, and 2.5 g of beads. Contact time and initialconcentration on adsorption into BHec-RP (dead cells) areshown in Fig. 7. This subsection discusses the mechanism of
MO adsorption into BHec-RP (dead cells). To understand the
mechanism from aqueous solution into the BHec-RP (deadcells) matrix, the Lagergren kinetics model is used to researchthe pseudo- rst-order and pseudo-second-order models in

Fig. 7 shows the pseudo- rst-order and pseudo-second-order
non-linear plots of MO adsorption using initial concentrationsof 50–300 mg L
−1at 40 °C. The results reported that equilibrium
was reached a er 12 hours of incubation, with a maximum
adsorption capacity ranging from 0.14 to 0.68 mg g−1. The
initial MO concentration is a driving force to overcome mass
transfer limitations between the absorbent and liquid phases. A
high initial MO concentration enhances the driving force ofmass transfer to increase adsorption capacity.
37Therst- and
second-order kinetic analysis results are summarized in Table4, showing the rate constant data ( K
1and K2) as well as corre-
lation coe ﬃcient values ( R2) for both models. Data in Table 4
show that the adsorption of MO into BHec-RP (dead cells) ts
the pseudo- rst-order kinetic model. The coe ﬃcient ( R12) for
the pseudo- rst-order model is higher than the pseudo-second-
order model. Furthermore, the theoretical qevalues are also
closer to the experimental results for all initial MO concentra-tions. This result shows that the pseudo- rst-order model more
accurately predicts MO adsorption on BHec-RP than thepseudo-second-order model.

tion process was carried out at 40 °C, with initial MO concen-trations ranging from 50 to 300 mg L

evaluation of the models for the beads is presented in Table 5.
Fig. 8 shows that the Langmuir isotherm plot is more
consistent with the data than the Freundlich isotherm. This isreected in the summary of the analysis, which shows correlation
coeﬃcients ( R
2) close to 1, while for the Freundlich isotherm, it is
negative. Additionally, the sum of squared residuals (RSS) andreduced chi-square (Red. Chi-Sqr) values for the Langmuirisotherm are the smallest, showing a strong correlation. Theconformity suggests that the adsorption of MO into the beads is
a monolayer process with a maximum capacity of 2.374 mg g
−1.
Degradation kinetics
Several models have been applied to describe the biodegrada-
tion of organic pollutants. Exponential functions (pseudo- rst-
order kinetics) depict such biodegradation.32,37,41Therefore,
this research determined the biodegradation kinetics of MO
with BHec-RP (live cells) and free cells using the rst-order
equation based on Fig. 9a and b data using eqn (9). The rateconstant can be calculated from the slope.

The adoption of immobilized cells to degrade MO was
investigated through various initial concentrations. The results
are shown in Fig. 9a, where MO is signi cantly degraded by
BHec-RP (live cells). Table 6 summarizes the data for thekinetics of MO degradation through BHec-RP (live cells),expressed by the rst-order reaction model ( R

biodegradation rate constant kis directly proportional to the
initial concentration of MO, with the rate constant ranging from0.025 to 0.0017 mg L

tions above the value show a gradual decrease in the rate.
Similarly, as listed in Table 6, it also reports data on the
kinetics of MO degradation by free R. pickettii cells, with the
maximum rate being 0.015 –0.014 mg L−1h−1at 50–100 mg L−1

faster than free R. pickettii cells. Zhang et al.40reported that
immobilized cells are always superior. These results wereconsistent with other studies that used immobilized cells forthe biodegradation of methyl violet,

tion of R. pickettii into the matrix of polyvinyl alcohol, alginate,

performed variations in PVA (2.5 –15%) and hectorite levels (0.5 –
4%), as shown in Fig. 10. The alginate level was 1%, and theinoculum was adjusted to the mixture volume at a bacterialdensity of OD 600 =1 absorbance. Zhang et al.
40reported that
alginate content exceeding 1% led to denser bead structuresand in uenced a decrease in cell viability due to the limited
bacterial adhesion space.
Fig. 10 shows that the optimal levels of immobilization
carriers for R. pickettii are PVA 10% (w/v) and hectorite 1% (w/v).In Fig. 10a, the matrix's PVA concentration signi cantly a ﬀects
the MO degradation rate. The appropriate PVA content deter-mines the mechanical properties of BHec-RP beads. Thisresearch found that 2.5 –7.5% PVA levels showed a perfect round
shape but low mechanical properties, as shown by breakagewhen pressed with ngers. A PVA concentration of 10% showed
high mechanical stability, resisting breakage when pressed and
producing perfectly round beads (Fig. 11). In contrast, a PVA
concentration of 15% resulted in very rigid or hard beads. A PVAconcentration of 10% showed optimum mechanical propertiesand a degradation rate.
36,37,40,65El-Naas et al.67reported that
a PVA content of 10% produces high porosity and a stablemicrostructure with pore distribution. The porous structureenhances the substrate and oxygen di ﬀusion rates required by
cells. Increasing the PVA concentration a ﬀects the thickness or
strength of the bead walls and reduces the number and size of
macro pores.
68However, this condition has been addressed by
adding inorganic materials such as kaolin,41bentonite,69acti-
vated sludge,70and hectorite.
The in uence of hectorite concentration, as shown in
Fig. 10b shows that when the concentration is above 1%, therate of MO degradation sharply decreases, ranging from 10% to40%. High concentrations in the beads may have obstructed the
cell space, adversely a ﬀecting bacterial activity.

is between 1% and 2.5%.36,37,40,65Generally, increasing the
concentration of inorganic material in the immobilization
matrix a ﬀects the mechanical properties of beads but has
a negative in uence on the ability of cells to degrade pollut-
ants.37,41,71,72Based on the variations in PVA and hectorite
concentrations, the optimal decolorization formulationconsists of PVA 10% and hectorite 1%.
Eﬀect of pH and temperature. Another crucial factor in MO
degradation using immobilized cells is pH and temperature. Inthis research, the in uence of the variable on the MO decolor-
ization process is depicted in Fig. 10c and d. Fig. 10c shows the
inuence of pH ranging from 5 to 10, where the optimum
degradation activity is achieved at pH 7 and a rate of 99%. Thedegradation rate signi cantly decreases under acidic and alka-
line conditions, where there is competition between hydrogenions and MO molecules for adsorption onto the surface of BHec-RP.
59,60Meanwhile, alkaline conditions result in charge repul-
sion due to the increased negative charge of BHec-RP. The
results showed that changes in the environmental degradation
pH led to alterations in the cell and bead surface charges. Underacidic or alkaline conditions, the structure can be damaged,and enzymes may become inactive, showing no degradationactivity.
73The visualization of the pH in uence on MO degra-
dation rate is shown in Fig. 10c. The morphology of BHec-RP inFig. 12a –d con rms that the MO decolorization process is
highly dependent on pH changes. Fig. 12e is BHec-RP (dead
cells) that only shows an adsorption process; hence, its bead
morphology is the same as in Fig. 12c and d. This morphologyshows that the MO decolorization process occurs due todegradation by R. pickettii .
Another factor in uencing MO degradation by BHec-RP is
temperature, as shown in Fig. 10d. These results show that theoptimum temperature is achieved at 40 °C. Generally, theoptimum biodegradation temperature range is around 30 –40 °
C,
12,74showing that R. pickettii is a mesophilic bacterium, and
higher optimum temperatures can be found in thermophilicbacteria.
75At high temperatures, cell viability decreases, and
enzymes included in MO degradation can denature.76For some
bacteria, such as Aeromonas hydrophila ,Pseudomonas sp, andShewanella oneidensis MR-1, the optimum temperature is ach-
ieved in the range of 35 –40 °C.12,59,77
Eﬀect of reuse and residual viable cell. The repeated use of
immobilized cells can reduce cell waste, save time, and lowercultivation costs,
78and the reusability of BHec-RP is shown in
Fig. 13. The results show stable degradation e ﬃciency in cycles
1–3, with a decline observed in cycles 4 –8. In the seventh and
eighth cycles, BHec-RP starts to weaken and easily breaks due toover-swelling. The high degradation e ﬃciency and stability of
BHec-RP during the reusability test suggest that the immobili-zation methods are suitable for application in waste treatment.The stability of beads in uences the reusability of MO decol-
orization by R. pickettii , as reported in other studies on Bacillus
fusiformis (BFN), nitrifying bacteria,
40and Bacillus mycoides .41
The decline in MO removal activity is consistent with the
decrease in R. pickettii CFU counts. The reduction in immobi-
lized cell numbers can be attributed to a combination of celldeath, matrix leakage (if entrapped), di ﬀusion pathway
blockage, and waste toxicity.
79Wojcieszynska et al.80reported
that while this immobilization system o ﬀers several advantages,
increasing the number of immobilized cell cycles leads tomatrix pore blockage, limiting oxygen and nutrient di ﬀusion.

and their degradation e ﬃciency. For instance, R. pickettii
immobilized using an alginate –polyvinyl alcohol –bentonite
matrix exhibited a signi cant decrease in OD600 and demon-
strated degradation e ﬀectiveness for only two cycles.81In
contrast, studies on immobilized bacterial-fungal consortiumcells in a PVA matrix reported Direct Fast Scarlet 4BS degrada-tion eﬀectiveness for up to 30 cycles,
82a consortium on B. lat-
erosporus /G. geotrichum immobilized on coconut peat showed
textile e ﬄuent degradation e ﬀectiveness (>80%) for up to 7
cycles.83These cases highlight that several other factors in u-
ence the performance of immobilized bacteria in pollutantdegradation over multiple cycles. Cell type, consortiumcomposition, matrix quality, and immobilization methodappear to signi cantly impact cell stability.
Identi cation of enzymes and degradation metabolites
Enzymes found in the decolorization reaction are broadly
categorized into two main groups, namely reducing andoxidizing. Lignin, peroxidase, laccase, tyrosinase, azoreductase,
riboavin reductase, NADH-DCIP reductase, and aminopyrine
N-demethylase were reported to be included in the degradation
of azodyes.
59,84,85Srinivasan et al.13reported that enzymes
produced by each bacterial species are responsible for the dyemolecule's structure fragmentation. This research stated theactivity of azoreductase and NADH-DCIP reductase, as reducingenzymes, and laccase, representing oxidizing enzymes, assummarized in Table 7.
To get insight into the MO decolorization mechanism by R.
pickettii , the activities of azoreductase, NADH-DCIP reductase,
and laccase were determined before (just a er inoculation, i.e.,
0 h) and a er decolorization ( i.e., within 48 h of incubation).
The azoreductase assay was performed in a 2.0 mL reactionmixture containing 4.45 mM×methyl red, 0.2 mL enzyme
solution, and 50 mM potassium phosphate bu ﬀer (pH 7.5).
Aer the addition of 100 mM NADH to initiate the reaction, the
reductive cleavage of methyl red was monitored spectrophoto-
metrically at 430 nm ( d430 nm =23 360 M
−1cm−1).86NADH –
DCIP reductase activity was measured using a reaction mixturecontaining 25 mM DCIP and 0.2 mL of enzyme solution in
50 mM potassium phosphate bu ﬀer (pH 7.5). A 2.0 mL aliquot
from the reaction mixture was combined with 250 mM NADH.
The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dichlorophenol indo-phenol (NADH-DCIP) reductase assay involved monitoring the
reduction in color intensity of DCIP at a wavelength of 590 nm,
which was monitored spectrophotometrically ( 3=19mM
−1cm−1).87Laccase enzyme activity was conducted through
the observation of an increase in absorbance at 420 nm, which
was attributed to the oxidation of the 2,20-azino-bis(3-
ethylbenzthiazoline)-6-sulfonate (ABTS) compound.88One unit
of laccase activity is de ned as the amount of enzyme required
to oxidize 1 nmol of ABTS per minute at 28 °C.
Table 7 shows that the extracellular crude enzyme activity in
the control group is lower than in free R. pickettii and immo-
bilized cells (BHec-RP). Similar results were reported in Kocuria
rosea (MTCC 1532), showing an increase in laccase, azor-
eductase, and NADH-DCIP reductase activities a er induction
with MO and malachite green.76,89In this research, the activity
of laccase, azoreductase, and NADH-DCIP reductase enzymeswas higher than undere immobilization conditions. Thesignicant di ﬀerence in enzyme activity between free and
immobilized cells is attributed to position. In free cells, secretedenzymes are suspended in the decolorization medium. In
immobilized cells, a signi cant portion of enzymes is protected
within the matrix, resulting in lower measured activity. Thedetection of extracellular enzyme activity shows that a part ofthe decolorization process occurs extracellularly. The threetypes of enzymes analyzed are most commonly reported in thedecolorization of azo dyes.
49,51,75The knowledge regarding the
types of enzymes shows the character of the produced metab-olites. For example, azoreductase is responsible for symmetric
cleavage, while laccase and LiP function asymmetrically,
8and
NADH-DCIP reductase is included in reduction reactions.90
These enzymes play a crucial role in breaking down the azodyes, leading to the decolorization process.
75,91 –93The diﬀerent
functions of each enzyme provide insight into the speci c
mechanisms involved in the degradation of these compounds.Understanding the types of enzymes involved can also help inoptimizing bioremediation processes for more e ﬃcient and
eﬀective dye removal from industrial wastewater.
94Additionally,
further research on the metabolites produced by these enzymescan provide valuable information for designing tailored enzymecocktails for enhanced decolorization performance.
Identi cation of metabolites and proposed determination of
biodegradation pathway
Identi cation of post-degradation dye metabolites is crucial to
understanding the extent of pollutant degradation. The searchfor microbial strains with exceptional pollutant mineralizationcapabilities is the focus of di ﬀerent studies since microbial
processes are categorized as environmentally safe green
processes. However, the capabilities of microbial cells vary,specically in the ability to produce enzymes that play a role in
breaking down the molecular structure of pollutants. In thisanalysis, the identi cation of metabolites was performed using
LC-QTOF-MS, as shown in Fig. 14. The chromatogram showsve diﬀerent peaks compared to the control, predicted to be
metabolites at retention times of 2.78, 2.98, 3.52, 4.65, and 5.97
minutes. Meanwhile, the control peak for MO is present at
a retention time of 7.28 minutes.

specic retention times are suspected to be metabolites
resulting from the degradation of MO by immobilized R. pick-
ettii. Based on the mass spectra, fragments of the suspected
metabolites were obtained, as shown in Table 8. The molecularstructure prediction of MO metabolites was based on reference
methods and PathPred ( https://www.genome.jp/tools/pathpred/
).
8This resulted in several predicted molecular fragmentations
with successive m/zvalues following the sequence of symbols
(B) 267.12; (C) 189.09; (D) 179.07; (E) 169.09; and (F) 165.05.Symbol A represents the basic structure of MO. This datashows that MO is subjected to fragmentation towards simplermolecules by opening the aromatic ring. Similar patterns havebeen observed in some bacteria applied for MO degradation
and certain azo dyes, such as Franconibacter sp. 1 MS,
8Kocuria
rosea MTCC 1532 (ref. 89), and Aeromonas hydrophila .59
Fig. 15 shows the predicted biodegradation pathway of MO,
where a desulfonation and aromatic structure oxidation reac-tion occurs from molecule A to B. Enzymatic reactions leadingto the transformation of molecule B into an open-chain struc-ture have been obtained using the Predicted Pathway applica-tion. The rst reaction in this pathway includes desulfonation
and hydroxylation on the aromatic ring, which dioxygenaseenzymes can catalyze. Mono- and dioxygenase enzymes, phenol
hydroxylase, and catechol-2,3-dioxygenase are commonly found
inR. pickettii , catalyzing the oxidation of aromatic rings such as
toluene. Meanwhile, hydroxylation is an enzymatic mechanismthat facilitates the transformation of functional groups intocarbonyl, acetyl, and decarboxylation. The proposed degrada-tion sequence seems logical due to the similar patternsformed.
95
Molecular fragmentation from B to F comprises complex
reactions that may include various oxidoreductase and oxy-
genase enzymes, based on the PathPred application. However,the identi ed enzymes are azoreductase and NADH-DCIP
reductase, which are included in the reduction of azo bonds.
75
These two enzymes show higher activity than the control,showing that MO and its fragments successfully induce thebiosynthesis of reducing enzymes. These two enzymes showhigher activity than the control, showing that MO and Its frag-
ments successfully induce the biosynthesis of reducing
enzymes. Overall, the degradation pathway of MO involvesa series of intricate reactions mediated by speci c enzymes.

© 2024 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry RSC Adv. ,2 0 2 4 , 14, 18277 –18290 | 18287Paper RSC AdvancesThrough the reduction of azo bonds by enzymes such as azor-
eductase and NADH-DCIP reductase, MO and its fragments are
successfully broken down into simpler molecules.49,96This
process demonstrates the e ﬀectiveness of MO in inducing the
biosynthesis of reducing enzymes, ultimately aiding in thebreakdown of the compound into carbonyl, acetyl, and decar-boxylation functional groups. The logical progression ofmolecular fragmentation seen in this study further supports theproposed degradation sequence for MO.
The fragmentation of MO varies signi cantly depending on
the microbial strain used. Di ﬀerent strains will undoubtedly
adopt their own pathways and enzymes. Several studies haveshown that MO is subjected to both symmetric and asymmetricfragmentations, which are catalyzed by azoreductase and ligninperoxidase, respectively.
8,97Furthermore, laccase is strongly
included in thiazole yellow G's desulfonation and demethyla-tion reactions.
98This con rms that R. pickettii laccase is used in
molecule A's desulfonation and demethylation reactions,
resulting in the production of fragments B and C. Overall, thediverse enzymatic activities of di ﬀerent microbial strains play
a crucial role in the fragmentation of MO. The involvement ofazoreductase, lignin peroxidase, and laccase in these reactionshighlights the complexity of the process.
26,75,99The speci c
pathways and enzymes utilized by each strain further under-score the variability in MO fragmentation. These ndings shed
light on the intricate mechanisms involved in the degradation
of MO by microbial communities.
