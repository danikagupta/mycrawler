          ABSTRACT                      
Introduction  
Nowadays, water pollution has become a 
matter of great concern in our society. 
Most of the water pollutions are related to 
the industrial effluents. Textile industry is 
the one of the most important industry in       all over world and this industry uses large 
volumes of water in wet processing 
operations and thereby, generates 
substantial quantities of wastewater 
containing large amounts of dissolved 
dyestuffs and other products. Textiles are Keywords

Textile 
effluent.  Disposal of dyes into the environment causes serious damage and also they may be 
toxic to some aquatic organisms due to their breakdown products. The chemical and 
physical methods have many disadvantages which can overcome by biological 
method because it is cost saving and environmentally benign. Among different 
decolorizing microorganisms bacteria can degrade and even completely mineralize 
many dyes under certain conditions. In the present study an attempt was made to 
examine the potential of newly isolated Pseudomonas putida for decolorization of azo 
dye- Remazol Black B in batch reactor. The influence of different concentration of 
glucose, pH and temperature on decolorization was studied to find the optimum 
conditions required for maximum decolorization and degradation. pH 7.0 and 350C 
were considered to be the optimum decolorizing conditions because in these 
conditions only the maximum decolorize was found. 5g/L glucose present media 
showed the maximum decolorization. This new isolate grew well in a high 
concentration of dye (300mg L-1) and 97.12% decolorized within 48 h and also 
tolerated upto 1000mg/L of dye. Colorless cells of P. putida and UVVisible 
spectroscopic analyses suggested that the decolorizing activity only through 
biodegradation not by inactive surface adsorption. The above results show the 
potential of this bacterial strain to be used in the biological treatment of textile 
effluent under optimum condition.

made of a variety of materials and may 
contain a large number of chemicals that  
are employed during the production of 
fibers as preservative, finishing, and 
coloring agents.  
More than 10,000 dyes are used in the 
textile industry and <280,000 tonnes of 
textile dyes are discharged every year 
worldwide as untreated effluents in the 
form of wastewater into public drains that 
eventually empty into rivers (Hsueh et al., 
2005). Most of them are recalcitrant in 
nature, especially azo dyes. Azo dyes (N = 
N group) form the largest class of 
synthetic dyes with a variety of colour and 
structure (Minussi et al., 2001  Gharbani 
et al., 2008). These dyes account for 
approximately 60-70% of all dyes used in 
food and textile manufacture. Worldwide 
at the time of production and application 
about 2- 50% of these dyes are lost as 
waste effluents (Olukanni et al., 2009).   
Discharge of these dyes may significantly 
affect photosynthetic activity in aquatic 
life by reducing light penetration and 
phytoplanktons  form abnormal colouration 
(Duran and Esposito 2000; Mester and 
Tien 2000; Wu, et al., 2011). This also 
alters the pH, increases the biochemical 
oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical 
oxygen demand (COD), and gives the 
rivers intense colourations and public is 
greatly concerned about water quality. The 
presence of unnatural colours is 
aesthetically unpleasant and tends to be 
associated with contamination. Without 
adequate treatment these dyes will remain 
in the environment for an extended period 
of time (Olukanni et al., 2006).  
Furthermore, the dye bearing effluents are 
considered to be a very complex and 
inconsistent mixture of many pollution 
substances ranging from organic chlorine based pesticides to heavy metals and is 
considered to be recalcitrant and non 
biodegradable. So the removal of dyes 
from water body has draw great attention 
within environmental research. Dye 
wastewater is usually treated by physical 
or chemical treatment processes. Although 
they can remove dyes partially, various 
limitations prevent them to be economical 
and thus cannot be used widely and 
economically  (Chen et al., 2003).   
Currently, biological methods are using 
often to remove dyes in wastewater 
because of its excellent decolorization 
ability, cheaper and environment friendly. 
Microbial decolorization is an Ecofriendly 
and cost competitive alternative to 
chemical decomposition process (Moosvi 
et al., 2005). A number of microorganisms 
have been found to be able to decolourize 
textile dyes including bacteria, fungi, and 
yeasts (Olukanni et al., 2006). They have 
developed enzyme systems for the 
decolourization and mineralization of azo 
dyes under certain environmental 
conditions (Pandey et al., 2007). In the 
case of enzymatic remediation of azo dyes, 
azo reductases and laccases seem to be the 
most promising enzymes. Laccases have 
been shown to decolourize a wide range of 
industrial dyes (Reyes et al., 1999; 
Rodriguez et al., 1999).  
The general approach of bioremediation is 
to improve the natural degradation 
capacity of the native organisms. There are 
many variables or factors affecting 
enzyme production and decolorization that 
are expressed by different taxa and culture 
conditions. The ability of microorganisms 
to carry out dye decolorization has 
received much attention and several 
bacteria capable of dye decolorization, 
either individually or in consortia (Verma 
and Madamwar, 2003; Mossvi et al., Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2013) 2(4): 108-116   
110 
2007). The present study focused on 
isolation and screening of a new potent 
strain for decolorizing Remazol Black B 
(Azo dye) and optimize its culture 
parameters to maximizing the 
decolorization .    
Materials and Methods  
Isolation and screening the decolorizing 
strain  
The soil samples were collected from three 
different sites of dye industry in sterile 
bags and brought to laboratory within 
24hrs to isolate potent dye decolorizing 
bacteria. The isolation of bacterial strains 
were carried out by serially diluting the 
soil samples in saline water and 
subsequently plating  on Nutrient Agar 
medium using pour plate method. Seven 
different colonies were obtained through 
serial dilution method and then serial 
streaking on nutrient agar. Each strain was 
then inoculated into nutrient broth and 
incubated 24 h at 35oC. Each colony was 
named as MS1, MS2, MS3, MS4, MS5, 
MS6 and MS7. These test cultures were 
grown in mineral salt medium amended 
with Remazol Black B dye (1000 mgL-1) 
and screened for dye decolorization. Strain 
that showed high decolorizing potential 
was chosen for further optimization study.  
Identification and characterization of 
the strain  
Morphological, physiological and 
biochemical characteristics of the potent 
dye decolorizing strain, MS7 was 
determined by the method described in 
Bergeys Manual of Determinative 
Bacteriology (Holt et al., 1993).   Growth medium  
Mineral salt medium (MSM) was prepared 
with the following composition and was 
used for all the studies (g l-1): Na2HPO4 
(2.0), (NH4)2SO4 (3.0), MgSO4.7H2O 
(0.25), CaCl2.7 H2O (0.25), 0.5% (w/v) 
yeast extract,  glucose (10) and 1 mlL-1 of 
mineral solution (1 g/l MnSO4·H2O, 0.5g/l 
CoCl2·6H2O, 0.2g/l CuCl2·2H2O, 0.1 /l 
ZnCl2 and 0.4 g/l Na2MoO4·2H2O). The 
pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.0 by 
addition of either 1N NaOH or 1N HCl .   
Decolorization by Shake flask culture  
Optimization of dye decolorization was 
carried in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks with 
100 ml of medium and incubated at 150 
rpm for 24 h at 35oC. This batch 
experiment was run under various growth 
conditions varying one at a time while 
keeping others constant. All experiments 
were performed in triplicate.  
Effect of pH   
Media pH was adjusted into 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 
and 8 by addition of either 1N NaOH or 
1N HCl in order to study its effect on 
decolorization of Remazol Black B by 
newly isolated MS7. At the same time 
other parameters kep t constant .  
Effect of temperature   
In order to study the effect of temperature 
on decolorization of Remazol Black B by 
MS7 was carried out at different 
incubation temperatures ranges 25, 30, 35 
40 and 45oC while kept other parameters 
constant.     Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2013) 2(4): 108-116

Effect of different concentration  
To determine the effect of different initial 
concentrations of Remazol Black B  on dye 
decolorization by MS7, media was 
amended different initial concentrations 
such as 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 
450 and 500mg L-1 and incubated for 24 
hrs. This experiment was studied at a 
constant condition.   
Effect of different initial concentration 
of glucose  
To find the optimum concentration of 
glucose for dye decolorization by MS7 
glucose free media was supplemented with 
various initial concentration of glucose (1, 
2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 gl-1) and cultures were 
incubated at an optimum condition for 
24hrs.  
Decolorization assay  
Samples were withdrawn and centrifuged 
at 10,000 rpm for 5 min and collected 
supernatant to estimate the % of 
decolorization. The supernatant was read 
at 595nm by UV- Visible 
spectrophotometer. 1mM same dye was 
used as blank. The percentage of 
decolorization was calculated by the 
following formula  
 
 
Where, Ii and If are initial and final 
absorbance of the dye solution. Each 
decolorization value is a mean of two 
parallel experiments.  
Statistical Analysis  
Correlations analysis (Karl Pearson) was 
performed to find the degree of relationship between the variables. This 
was done by Software - MINITAM 
Release 12.2.    
Results and Discussion  
Isolating and developing new strain will 
be beneficial in textile wastewater 
treatment. The isolation of efficient dye 
decolourisation bacteria from the samples 
collected from dye contaminated soil and 
wastewater indicates the natu ral adaptation 
of these microorganisms to survive in the 
presence of the toxic dyes (Khadijah  et 
al., 2009). In the present study soil 
samples collected from the dye industry 
when subjected to serial dilution and 
subsequently plated on a solid enrichment 
media yielded nearly 7 distinct bacterial 
colonies. Each colony was named as MS1, 
MS2, MS3, MS4, MS5, MS6 and MS7. 
All the strains were cultivated in MSM 
amended with 1000 mgL-1 of Remazol 
Black B for 24hrs at 350C.   
Among the isolated colonies, colony MS7 
showed the maximum decolorization then 
other strains. MS7 was a potent dye 
decolorizing strain and hence it was 
selected for further studies. Several 
authors have been reported about the 
isolation and screening of microorganisms 
capable of decolourising various azo dyes 
from sludge samples collected from 
wastewater treatment sites contaminated 
with dyes. (Chen et al., 2003; Senan and 
Abraham, 2004; Khadijah, et al., 2009).  
Characterization and identification of 
decolorizing strain  
Table 1 shows the results of the 
morphological , physiological and 
biochemical characteristics of strain MS7. 
Morphologically MS7 showed a pinpoint, Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2013) 2(4): 108-116

slimy surface, smooth margin, raised, 
transferent , with an entire margin on 
nutrient agar plates. It was a gram-
negative rod shape.   
Table. 1 Morphological , physiological  and 
biochemical characteristics of strain MS7.  It could hydrolyze urea and utiliz ed citrate. 
Strain MS7 was showed positive and 
negative responses for various 
biochemical tests (Table1). Based on the 
results from morphological, physiological 
and biochemical characteristics, strain 
MS7 was identified as Pseudomonas 
putida.     
Effect of pH on decolorization of 
Remazol Black B    
The pH tolerance of decolorizing bacteria 
is quite important because reactive azo 
dyes bind to cotton fibers by addition or 
substitution mechanisms under alkaline 
conditions and at high temperatures (Aksu, 
2003). pH has a major effect on the 
efficiency of dye decolorization, and the 
optimal pH for color removal is often 
between 6.0 and 10.0 (Chen et al., 2003; 
Guo et al., 2007; Kilic et al., 2007).    
In the present study the maximum 
decolorization of Remazol Black B was 
achieved at pH 7.0 with 93.23% in 48 hrs 
(Fig.1). The optimum pH of the growth of 
Pseudomonas putida was neutral. This 
result accordance with Bhatt Nikhil et al.,  
(2012) they found that the consortium 
SpNb1 exhibited optimum decolorizing 
activity at pH 7.5 with maximum dye 
decolorization 94.95 ± 0.09 % and 29.98 
mgL-1 h-1 dye removal rates within 9.30 
hrs at 300 ppm dye concentration . Further 
increase in pH, dye decolorizing activity 
of the culture was decreased. This may be 
related to the transport of dye molecules 
across the membrane, which is considered 
a rate limiting step.    Test Characteristics Response

Remazol Black B by Pseudomonas putida .  
   
Effect of temperature on decolorization 
of Remazol Black B   
The best decolorization was achieved at 
temperature 35oC and 40oC with 94.25% 
and 83.65% decolorization respectively in 
48 h (Fig.2). This could be owing to a 
greater production of enzymes and 
maximal growth conditions of the bacterial 
culture for its dye decolonization ability. 
Saratale et al., (2010) and Bhatt Nikhil et 
al., (2012) reported that 37oC temperature 
gave maximum decolorization by bacterial 
consortium. Decolorizing activity was 
significantly suppressed at 42oC, which 
might be due to the loss of cell viability or 
deactivation of the enzymes responsible 
for decolorization at 42oC (Cetin and 
Donmez, 2006; Panswad and Luangdilok, 
2000).   
Effect of initial concentration of 
Remazol Black B  
The biodegradation abilities of 
microorganisms can be enhanced by 
gradually exposing them to higher concentrations of synthetic organic 
chemicals. Adaptation of a microbial 
community toward toxic or recalcitrant 
compounds is found to be very useful in 
improving the rate of decolorization 
process (Dafale et al., 2008). Generally the 
microorganisms are performing their 
metabolic processes at the optimum 
substrate concentration.   
Different experimental parameters are 
affecting the enzyme kinetics. Enzyme 
kinetics follows the principles of general 
chemical reaction kinetics. At lower 
substrate concentration, the initial reaction 
velocity is proportional to substrate 
concentration (1st order reaction). Further 
increase in substrate concentration does 
not affect the reaction rate and the latter 
became constant (zero order reaction). 
Above the optimum level of substrate 
concentration may be stopped the process 
or reduced reaction rate. In the present 
investigation the maximum decolorization 
was obtained with 97.12% at 300mg L-1 
(Fig.3).

decolorization of Remazol Black B by

Fig. 3 Effect of initial concentration of 
Remazol Black B on decolorization by 
Pseudomonas putida .  
  
When increase in initial dye concentration 
decrease in decolorization due to toxicity 
of the dyes to the growing microbial cells 
at higher dye concentrations. Gopinath et 
al,. (2009), studied that the biodegradation 
of Congo Red by a strain of Bacillus sp 
obtained from tannery industry effluent, 
the increase in initial dye concentration 
decreased the decolorization rate, and at 
high concentrations (1500 and 2000 mg 
L1), inhibition was observed.   
Effect of different initial concentration 
of glucose  
There are only very few bacteria that are 
able to grow on azo compounds as the sole 
carbon source; these bacteria cleave 
N=N 
bonds reductively and utilize 
amines as the source of carbon and energy 
for their growth, but such organisms are 
specific towards their substrate (Pandey et 
al., 2007). In the present study the 
maximum decolorization of Remazol 
Black B was achieved 5g/l glucose present 
media with 93.24% (Fig.4).   
Above this concentration not supported the 
decolorization. Wang et al., (2009) reported that the lack of glucose inhibited 
the Reactive Red 180 decolorizing activity 
of Citrobacter sp. CK3 since only 26.72% 
color removal was observed after 120 h 
incubation . When glucose supplemented, 
Citrobacter sp. CK3 exhibited strong 
decolorizing activity with about 90% 
decolorization extent in 48 h, except that 
when the glucose concentration was 0.5 gl-
1 or 12 gl-1, the decolorization efficiencies 
(64.19% and 67.23% in 120 h, 
respectively) were much lower. The 
reason low glucose (0.5 gl-1) concentration 
could not meet the growth requirements of 
the bacteria. When the glucose 
concentration was much higher, such as 12 
gl-1, the bacteria could utilize glucose 
preferentially , thus resulting in lower 
decolorization extent.   
Fig.4 Effect of different initial 
concentration of glucose on decolorization 
of Remazol Black B by Pseudomonas 
putida.  
 
  
In this study, Pseudomonas putida MS7 
was isolated from industrial effluents . This 
bacterial strain, showed decolorizing 
activity through a degradation mechanism 
rather than adsorption. The maximum azo 
dye- Remazol Black B tolerant capacity of 
P. putida MS7 is 300 mgL-1. In the lab Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2013) 2(4): 108-116   
115 
scale study it showed the maximum 
decoloriaztion at pH  7.0, temperature 370C 
and glucose 5 mgL-1. This newly isolated 
strain has potential in the decolorization of 
various dye effluents. Statistical analysis -
correlation indicated that the above 
physical and chemical parameter and % 
decolorization are interdependent since 
they showed high degree of correlation.
