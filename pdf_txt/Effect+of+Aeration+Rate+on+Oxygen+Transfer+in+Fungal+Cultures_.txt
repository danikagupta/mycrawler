 ABSTRACT 
Submerged fungal fermentation using bubble column and airlift bioreactors 
was investigated for converting bioethanol liquid waste, vinasse into high- value 
fungal protein for fish or animal feed applications.  Previous studies suggested that 
fungal biomass yields are dependent on many environmental parameters such as: pH, 
nutrients, temperature, aeration rate, and colony morphology among others. There is a 
lack of studies that examine the oxygen mass transfer in fungal fermentation. This 
research closely examined the air -to-liquid oxygen mass transfer coefficient, 𝑘𝐿𝑎; an 
important factor affecting fungal biomass yield. Laboratory -scale, 2.5 L working 
volume  bubble column and air lift bioreactors with sugarcane ethanol process derived 
vinasse as a su bstrate  and the fungal species Rhizopus microsporus  var. oligosporus  
were used for oxygen mass transfer studies. Results show ed that 𝑘𝐿𝑎 followed a 
power curve for both airlift and bubble column configurations using water -only media  
for air flow rates ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 volume of air/volume of liquid /minute 
(vvm) . Power regression equations 𝑘𝐿𝑎𝐴𝐿𝑅 = 37.9∗𝑣𝑣𝑚0.949 and 𝑘𝐿𝑎𝐵𝐿𝑅 = 39.0∗
𝑣𝑣𝑚0.941 correspond to airlift and bubble column configurations, respectively.We 
determined that 𝑘𝐿𝑎 for vinasse media alone (i.e., without fungus), increased for 
increasing aeration rates  as expected  for the bubble column configuration from  10.1 
±0.2 h-1  to 59.4 ±1.9 h-1, respectively at aeration rates of 0.5 to 3.0 vvm. The 𝑘𝐿𝑎 for 
vinasse media was on average 34.1±17.7 % lower than water  at each aeration rate 
when operated without fungus. Results show ed that the presence of fungi in vinasse 
media resulted in decreases and increases of 𝑘 𝐿𝑎 compared to vinasse alone at 1.5 
vvm. A maximum biological enhancement of +30.7% at 6.53 g was observed. 
Knowledge of the oxygen mass transfer properties in complex media fermentation is 
crucial  for process scale- up and commercialization of the  fungal  technology.

 CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION  
Ethanol production by yeast fermentation  does not fully uti lize the potential 
energy of the starting raw material. The protein, lipids, and carbohydrates of biomass 
feedstocks such as corn, sugarcane, sweet sorghum, and sugarbe et are complex and 
not 100% utilized by yeast fermentation alone . Ethanol production's solid and liquid 
waste streams are rich in biological potential energy --the liquid waste stream is 
especially rich in nutrients because of yeast cells left over from fermentation.  
Developing co-products help to utilize the “waste” streams. Thus, co -products help to 
decrease the net cost and increase the energy  efficiency of ethanol production by 
finding a source of revenue and purpose for the waste stream . For example, the U nited 
State's 2012 corn- ethanol industry produced 13.3 billion gallons of ethanol while co -
producing 36.7 metric tons of high- quality lives tock feed from 4.8 billion bushels of 
corn. (Renewable Fuels Association, 2013)  
Other r esearchers have investigated generating co -products from sugar -based 
ethanol waste streams. Two  examples of co -products are, yeast protein concentrate 
(YPC) for carp fee d from bioethanol waste  and fungal biomass for protein feed 
ingredient from bioethanol waste, etc. ( Nitayavardhana and Khanal, 2010; Omar et 
al., 2011)  
The focus of this research is based on  the study from Nitayavardhana and 
Khanal  (2010) , in which they pr oposed an "innovative biorefinery concept" to 
increase the value of vinasse. They proposed adding a processing step  which involves 
fungal  fermentation using Rhizopus microsporus  (var. oligosporus ) on vinasse.   
Nitayavardhana and Khanal  (2010) conducted optimization studies using a series of 
250 mL shaker flasks containing 100 mL of media .  However, industry processing  
2 
 volumes for vinasse are on the order of 1x1010 L/year. Thus the re exists a  need for 
industrial scale f ermentation strategies. 
Sugarcane e thanol is distilled from the broth  of yeast fermentation on 
sugarcane syrup. Distillation leaves a waste,  an aqueous solution, known as vinasse , 
which consists of spent sugar -syrup, yeast cells, minerals and salts. Nitayavardhana 
(2012)  reported  that vinasse from sugarcane juice has the following characteristics: 
chemical oxygen demand of 30.4 g/L, biochemical oxygen demand of 16.7 g/L, total 
nitrogen of 628 mg/L, total phosphorous of 130 mg/L, sulfate of 1.4 g/L, and potassium of 2.0 g/L.  
Vinas se has hazardous effects when disposed of improperly to the 
environment. Traditionally vinasse is disposed by fertirrigation to the agricultur al 
lands. This practice,  however , has serious environmental concerns including 
increasing biological oxygen demand (BOD), causing nitrogen pollution and 
decreasing the alkalinity of soil . High levels of nitrogen in the water leads to algal 
blooms and lowered dissolved oxygen (DO) in streams, rivers, and gulfs. Decreased alkalinity of land leads to lower crop yield (Martinelli and Filoso, 2008) . 
In 2013, Nitayavardhana et al. investigated fungal fermentation using an airlift 
(ALR) and bubble column bioreactor (BLR) configurations.  The use of an ALR and BLR was more ideal because there is no mechanical mixing compared to the traditional stirred tank reactor. A  lower shear rate is essential to maintaining the 
desired morphology of the fungus in pellet form (versus mycelia hair -like structure).  
Other benefits of the ALRs and BLRs are lower operational cost for bulk liqui d 
mixing (versus mechanical impeller agitation) and lower maintenance costs due to lack of moving parts within the reactor (Smart and Fowler, 1984) .  
3 
 The aerobic nature of Rhizopus microsporus  requires supply of sufficient 
oxygen to the media to ensure non- growth limiting conditions in the reactor. 
Nitayavardhana et al. (2013) 2.5 L working volume ALR and BLR experiments 
showed that an aeration rate of 1.5 vvm (volumes of air per volume of liquid  per 
minute) resulted in the highest fungal yield:  8.04 ± 0.80 (g biomass increase/g  initial 
biomass) . At lower aeration rates (0.5 and 1.0 vvm) dissolved oxygen (DO) 
concentrations  were reduced to near 0 mg O 2/L after 24 hours of fermentation. This 
coincidence of lower yields at lower aeration rates suggests that insufficient DO reduces biomass yield .  
The optimal DO for fungal fermentations is 20- 50% of air saturation or about 
1.6-4.0 mg O
2/L (Su and He, 1997; Fadenza et al. 2010) .  DO concentrations can drop 
substantially during fungal growth w ith oxygen uptake rate  increasing directly with 
exponential growth phase and increased biomass concentration . Sufficient oxygen 
mass transfer from gas to liquid (i.e. from air bubble to vinasse) is essential to sustain fungal growth and maximize biomass yield (Rajagopalan and Modak, 1993; Garcia -
Ochoa et al., 2010) . 
One important parameter that describes the oxygen mass transfer in 
bioreactors is the volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient, 𝑘
𝐿𝑎. 𝑘𝐿𝑎  is a 
coefficient which is determined by the physical and operational  properties of the 
bioreactor. When 𝑘𝐿𝑎 is known, the oxygen mass transfer rate  (OTR)  can be known. 
However, no studies have measured 𝑘 𝐿𝑎 for fungal fermentation on vinasse.  
Chemical and biological engineers have researched the many aspects and 
impa cts of 𝑘𝐿𝑎 in airlift and bubble column bioreactors.  The lumped volumetric 
oxygen mass transfer coefficient ( 𝑘𝐿𝑎) and it's dependent parameters:  liquid   
4 
 viscosity, gas bubble diameter, gas hold- up, gas -vector -liquid transfer, antifoaming 
agents, oxygen transfer efficiency, concentration gradients, exposure time, reactor 
geometry, and biomass oxygen uptake rate, are all subject areas well documented.  (Garcia- Ochoa et al., 2000; Garcia- Ochoa and Castro, 2001 ; Christi and Jauregui -
Haza, 2002;  Galactio n et al., 2004;  Kilonzo and Margaritis, 2004; Junker, 2007;  
Pilarek and Szewczyk, 2008;  Garcia- Ochoa and Gomez, 2009;  Suresh et al, 2009; 
Quijano et al., 2010; Garcia -Ochoa et al., 2010) However, how these topics pertain 
specifically to fungal fermentation in vinasse is yet to be determined. The importance  
of 𝑘
𝐿𝑎 and  𝑘𝐿𝑎 with  fungus  (𝐾𝐿𝑎) on bioreactor design and its effects on biomass 
yield warrants the investigation of 𝑘𝐿𝑎 and 𝐾𝐿𝑎 in fungal fermentations on vinasse 
substrate in airlift and bubble column bioreactors.   
By understanding the oxygen mass transfer properties of ALRs and BLRs in 
fungal fermentations, engineers can reduce aeration costs by only supplying the 
minimum amount of oxygen required to produce the maximal amount of  fungus. 
Reducing the operating costs of the co- product production is a crucial step to making 
it economical for use in the ethanol industry. Furthermore , by including a fungal 
fermentation step in the ethanol process, the e nvironmental impact of vinasse on the 
water quality  will be reduced  
The objectives of this study was to investigate the oxygen mass transfer of 
fungal fermentation using Rhizopus micros porus  (var. oligosporus ) on vinasse in 2.5 
L laboratory scale  airlift and bubble column bioreactor s.  First by  measuring 𝑘 𝐿𝑎 
under water -only and vinasse -only conditions at various aeration rates in ALR and 
BLR configurations, 𝑘𝐿𝑎 values can be estimated for the abiotic media. The second 
objective was  to measure the volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient during  
5 
 fungal fermentation 𝐾𝐿𝑎. 𝐾𝐿𝑎 is denoted with a capital K to signify there is a fungus 
present (i.e. there is oxygen consumption)  in the media.

 CHAPTER 2 LITERATURE REVIEW  
2.1  Fermentation Technology  
2.1.1  Submerged Fermentation 
Erlenmeyer Flasks  
The Erlenmeyer  flask is a small, laboratory scale cultivation vessel  (0.25-
1.00L) that can be used for fungal growth on vinasse. The Erlenmeyer flask can 
maintain  a closed environment at a low cost  which makes it ideal for primary 
experiments . Within an incubator shaker, a n Erlenmeyer flask can maintain a desired 
temperatu re, sterile environment, and at low volumes (<1L) , have  sufficient oxygen 
mass transfer rates ( 2.0-20.0 h-1 at 100 -160 rpm , 0.250- 2.000 L flasks, with 0.125-
1.200 L media ) (Nikakhtari and Hill,  2005) . However, drawbacks  of flasks  include 
lack of pH control  and reduced aeration  in scale- up—as aeration only occurs in the 
liquid -headspace  interface which ratio with the volume decreases with larger 
volumes. Another consideration is if the liquid is too high up the neck of the flask 
then the aeration will be significantly reduced  as well.  
Stirred Tank Bioreactors  
The stirred tank reactor (STR) is the most commonly used for microbial, 
single cell c ultivations. It scales from 1  L to 10,000 L . Submerged impellers are the 
standard mixing practice for STRs. The aspect ratio and the impeller type are designed to establish  to the mixing profile required for culturing microbial species . 
The two most common types of impellers are the radial -mixing Rus hton type and 
axial -mixing marine type.  With larger reactors, a mix of the two types of impellers is 
usually required to avoid stagnation zones and ensure good mixing. Baffles are  
7 
 installed to prevent vortexing, a phenomena which reduces mixing. Aeration is 
usually provided by a ring sparger at the bottom of the tank; the diameter of the ring, 
the height position, and orifice size are all variable design parameters for spargers (Doran, 2013) . 
Oxygen mass transfer is well characterized in this type of react or with 
literature suggesting the general form for predicting the volumetric mass transfer 
coefficient  (Nikakhtari and Hill, 2005) : 
𝑘
𝐿𝑎=𝐴0∗𝑁𝐴1∗𝑄𝐴2           (2 ) 
Where  𝐴0,𝐴1,𝐴2 are empirically derived constants unique to each stirred tank 
biore actor configuration, 𝑁 is stirrer speed in rpm, and 𝑄  is aeratio n rate in L/min. A 
major drawback to STRs is similar to the shaker flask is that the energy required to properly mix the stirred tank bioreactor increases exponentially with volume. The 
second major drawback is increased shear stress at the impeller tip, τ
tip, which 
increases linearly with both impeller length and stirrer speed  (Metzner and Otto, 
1957) :  
τtip∝𝑣𝑡𝑖𝑝=𝑟∗𝑁           (3 ) 
Shear stress is major concern because it can cause cell  death by rupturing the cell 
membrane  (Garcia -Ochoa and Gomez, 2009; Fontana and Silveira, 2012) . 
Airlift and Bubble Column Reactors  
Airlift and Bubble Column bioreactors (ALR and BLR) have been thoroughly 
researched and are characterized similar to stirre d tank bioreactors. Their ability to 
elicit growth curves and product yields  have been verified for bacteria, acti nomyectes, 
and filamentous mold ( Gavrilescu and Roman, 1993; Alesieva and Peeva, 2000) .  
8 
 There is no shortage of literature describing the phys ical configurations and models 
for airlift and bubble column bioreactors. A schematic of airlift and bubble column 
bioreactors is presented in the methods section Figure 3.1. To discuss the general configuration briefly, a vertical column (high aspect rati o) is closed at the top and 
bottom with forced aeration at the bottom of the tank. The gas bubbles from the  
bottom of the tank rise to the top, creating a convective force for mixing and provides  
gas exchange (O
2, CO 2, CO, etc.)  In conventional  ALR and BLR, there is no 
mechanical mixing.  However, configurations of ALRs and BLRs, which have added mechanical agitation or forced -liquid, have also been investigated  (Christi and 
Jauregui -Haza, 2002; Yazdian et al., 2010) . 
Mixing time , 𝜃, for ALRs a nd BLRs is  increased with height according to the 
following proportionality.:  
𝜃∝𝐻
1.7         (4 ) 
This means during the scale up of ALRs and BLRs, non- homogenous zones will 
appear  with noticeably reduced DO concentrations  and will not be replenished unt il 
the next pass th rough the riser zone. However, bubble residenc e time is increased with 
larger heights, resulting in an increase in oxygen mass transfer rates. Conversely bubble size is also inversely proportional to oxygen mass transfer rates (Smart and  
Fowler, 1984) . 
The use of ALRs and BLRs as bioreacto rs has encompassed mostly plant -cell 
and bacterial cultures . However , fungal experiments have also been investigated . 
Srivastava and Kundu (1999) reported using an ALR to produce cephalosporin- C in a 
fungus, Cephalosporium acremonium . Their objective was to produce fungal pellets, 
as opposed to the conventional mycelia form. They cite enhanced mass transfer using  
9 
 a bioparticle —Siran carrier. They reported 𝐾𝐿𝑎 = 100 h-1 and 70 h-1 for Siran  carrier 
and pellet modes, respectively.  
The viscosity of the media is a great concern for ALRs and BLRs. As 
viscosity  of the media  increases, momentum transfer is reduced and energy 
dissipation is increased.  ALRs and BLRs only source of mixing is the bubble rise 
velocity momentum transfer to the bulk liquid. While, operational power costs can be 
reduced by 17- 64% in ALRs and BLRs over STRs, aeration must be sufficient not 
only to oxygenate the system but to have the system well mixed as well  (Gavrilescu 
and Roman, 1993) . To achieve good mixing, the us e of a low viscosity liquid is  
recommended.   
2.1.2  Solid -State Fermentation  
Solid -state fermentation (SSF) is a less frequent strategy  of fungal cultivation 
compared to submerged fermentation (SmF).  SSF is c onducted by seeding 
filamentous fungi onto  a solid media , usually an agricultural residue such as cereal 
straw, which acts as physical support as well as a nutrient source . Three main 
configurations for this approach are the tray, packed bed, and rotating drum. The 
former two have no mechanical mixing and have low operating costs. Aeration is 
provided by either ambient air or forced air from the bottom of the reactor.   The rotating drum has minimal energy requirements, as the bioreactor is turned over  only  
periodically to mix the contents  (Dhillon et al., 2013) . SSF has no discernible liquid 
phase, however low levels of moisture are required for supporting the  growth. 
(Robinson and Nigam , 2003) . 
Pand ey et al. (2003) noted that f ilamentous fungi have been identified as the 
most successful organism to grown on solid media because of their ability to penetrate  
10 
 through the pores of the substrate .  SSF is considered the closest physical environment  
(i.e. damp wood)  for a fungus , but l arge-scale practice difficult to obtain because of a 
lack of process control.  
SSF in tray or packed bed configurations is  an un -mixed, non- homogenous 
fermentation strategy, which leads to a loss of control over culture parameters such as 
pH, temperature, nutrient concentration, moisture, and oxygen transfer. High moisture 
causes low oxygen mass transfer, and is thought to promote  anaerobic  bacterial 
contamination. Heat generation during the exponential  growth phase causes 
temperature build up in the SSF bio reactor . Increase temperature can denature 
products  and hinder fungal growth. Measurement of bioreactor performance is also 
very difficult given the non- homogeneity of the culture and general lack of analytical 
techniques. Correlating headspace gas composi tion (CO 2 and O 2) is the most reliable 
tool for characterizing the growth (Pand ey et al. , 2003; Robinson and Nigam, 2003) . 
2.1.3  Other Fermen tation  Configurations   
Coutte et al. (2010) used a bubbleless membrane bioreactor where a ho llow 
fiber membrane (e xternal and internal) was used for aeration in a conventional STR.  
An noteworthy advantage  of bubbleless membrane bioreactors is that they do not 
foam.  
Microbioreactors  are a small scale alternative to the industry standard 
submerged fermentations . They are casually defined as fermentation in less than 1 
mL. M aterials for microbioreactors are usually plastic which allows for complete 
fluidic design into 'one piece'. The small scale and plastic materials also makes microbioreactors disposable which removes a requirement for sterilization and 
decreases setup time. Proper mixing is a concern in the microbioreactor as turbulent  
11 
 mixing is difficult to achieve because of the small characteristic length. A lack of 
mixing does not mean a lack of gas exchange as it does in larger submerged fermentation . This is because at the small scale, membrane diffusion  is sufficient for 
gas exchange (Schapper et al., 2009) . 
2.2  Airlift/Bubble Column Reactors and  Pellet Morphology 
Researchers reported the benefits of specific fungal pellet morphologies in 
terms of product yields and biomass growth (Aleksieva and Peeva, 2000; Srivastava and Kundu, 1999). Fungal pellet morphology is suitable for submerged fermentation because of the hi gh surface area to volume ratio  (Nitayavardhana, 2013).  Fungal  
morphology can change  from pellet to hairy -like which cause  the fungus to grow over 
the impeller of a stirred tank reactor  and other fittings , reducing mixing characteristics 
(Pilarek and Szewczyk, 2008) . In ALR and BLR experiments  conducted by 
Nitayavardhana et al. (201 3), an aeration  rate of 2.0 vvm resulted in a lower biomass 
yield coinciding with a morphological change to filamentous  from pellet form .  
The ability of ALRs and BLRs to combine oxygen mass transfer and bulk 
mixin g with aeration allows them to provide a lower sheer environment while 
maintaining good aeration when compared to stir red tank reactors. Lower sheer is 
difficult to achieve  in larger, mixed bioreactors  due to the need for mixing.  The she ar 
stress cause by  bubbles on the fluid and the walls on the fluid are very low compared 
to the impeller on the fluid in a stirred tank bioreactor (Wood and Thompson, 1986) . 
However, since oxygen transfer is directly proportional to the aeration rate in ALRs and BLRs, oxyge n transfer will be limited by the highest tolerated aeration rate which 
does not cause a morphological change.   
12 
 ALR and BLR use also  avoids the use of impellers, which can cause cell 
mortality  (Coutte et al., 2010). 
Ethanol concentrations can cause changes in morphology. Ethanol 
concentrations less than 3% do not adversely affect fungal biomass yields. At 5% 
ethanol concentrations, fungal pellets agglomerate causing mass transfer problems 
that inhibit growth (Nitayavardhana, 2013) . In commercial vinasse, et hanol 
concentrations are lower due to higher recovery yields of ethanol (Nitayavardhana, 
2013) . This makes dilution not necessary for fungal fermentation on commercial 
vinasse.  However, if the vinasse is non -diluted there will be unknown implications on 
the oxygen mass transfer properties due to a higher concentration of solutes in the 
vinasse.  
2.3  Modes of Oxygen Transport  
The first and primary mode of oxygen transport in fungal fermentations  is 
through air bubbles forced through the liquid. The driving force of oxygen mass 
transfer is the concentration gradient, (𝐶∗−𝐶) of Equation 1, between the saturated 
air and the dissolved oxygen in the bulk liquid. Oxygen gas must diffuse through each 
film in order to reach the bulk liquid —gas bulk to gas film to liquid film, to liquid 
bulk—as shown in Figure 2.1.  
  
13 
  
Figure 2.1 Oxygen concentration profile from air bubble to liquid media 
(adapted from Garcia -Ochoa and Gomez, 2009)  
The mass transfer through the gas bulk and film is very fast compared to the  
mass dif fusion through the liquid film  and the liquid bulk. In engineering practice, the 
mass transfer rate  is measured  from t he rate limiting step, the  mass transfer through 
the liquid film , (i.e. 𝑘𝐿(𝐶∗−𝐶)). The assumption made for this calculation  is that 
oxygen concentration at  the gas-liquid interface  equals the oxygen saturation 
concentration for the bulk liquid (determined by the maximal steady state oxygen 
concentration with no microbes present in the media ) While  this method lump s the 
gas film resistance, 𝑘𝐺, into  𝑘𝐿, there are studies which look at the two film 
resistances separately. For the gas mass transfer rate, the driving force  is the 
difference between the gas bulk concentration and the gas -liquid interface 
concentration, 𝑘 𝐺(𝑃𝐺−𝑃∗).  Where 𝑃∗ and 𝑃𝐺 are the interface and bulk gas 
concentrations, respectively (Garcia -Ochoa and Gomez, 2010 ). 
 
14 
 Aeration through the head space -liquid interface can  also contribute to the 
dissolved oxygen concentrations in the bulk media, but this effec t is minimal.  Christi 
and Jauregui -Haza (2002) reported that a maximum of  12% of the total oxygen found 
in solution originated from the head space of a reactor . The experiments of this 
research lumped together the gas bubble and surface aeration together t o obtain the 
volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient, 𝑘𝐿𝑎, for the total reactor configuration.  
The concern for this research is only to identify the oxygen mass transfer contribution 
by the entire system —sparger and head space— thus lumping together  these two areas 
is defensible.  
2.4  Volumetric Oxygen Mass Transfer Coefficient, kLa, and i ts Measurement  
The 𝑘𝐿𝑎 can be empirically measured using the following differential equation 
represents the transient oxygen mass transfer in chemical reactions:  
𝑑𝐶
𝑑𝑡=𝑘𝐿𝑎(𝐶∗−𝐶)           (1 )  
Where 𝑑𝐶
𝑑𝑡 is the change in liquid phase oxygen gas concentration over time, 
𝑘𝐿𝑎  is the volumetric mass transfer coefficient, 𝐶∗ is the saturated liquid oxygen 
concentration, and  𝐶  is the liquid ox ygen concentration.  
The volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient, k La, is a lumped parameter 
of the oxygen mass transfer coefficient, k L, and the total volumetric gas -bubble 
surface area, a.  k La represents the proportional ity coefficient that when mul tiplied by 
the driving force, ( C*- C), gives the oxygen mass transfer rate (OTR) from air bubble 
to liquid solution. There have been countless studies and proposed theories which try 
to analytically determine  these two parameters and the numerous variables required 
for calculating k La for ALRs and BLRs  (Vasconcelos et al., 2003) . The  variables  
15 
 which influence  kLa be classified into four families  of variables: physical properties, 
geometric parameters, operatio nal conditions, and biomass concentration and type  
(Garcia- Ochoa and Gomez, 2009) . It is clear that  kLa is unique depending on 
bioreactor  configuration and media combination. In addition, the transient nature of 
biological fermentations al so causes physica l properties to change which in turn 
affects the k La value  (i.e. K La).  Therefore, m odels that predict  kLa are only applicable 
to small changes in the family of variables  or mono- varia nt studies (i.e. changing the 
temperature only while leaving other variables like aeration rate constant) .   
Understanding the OTR of the bioreactor is important because it directly 
impacts the dissolved oxygen concentration in the bioreactor and ultimate the growth 
of the fungus. 
If the  geometric parameters (heights, dia meter, sparger height, draft tube 
height, etc.) are fixed, including the sparger type. Then operational conditions that can 
be varied are temperature, aeration rate, and pH. Physical properties (viscosity, density, etc.) are dependent on the biomass and me dia type and will have transient 
values over the course of fermentation. Biomass weight and specific oxygen uptake rate will also be transient.  
kLa  can be determined by several different  methods including chemical 
methods, sodium sulfite oxidation method, adsorption of CO 2, physical methods, and 
dynamic methods  (Garcia -Ochoa and Gomez, 2009) . By far the most widely used to 
determine k La in ALRs and BLRs is the dynamic method where k La mea surement 
follows the following equation:   
𝑑𝐶
𝑑𝑡=𝑘𝐿𝑎(𝐶∗−𝐶)−𝑞𝑋∗𝑋          (5 )  
16 
 Where , 𝑞𝑋∗𝑋 is the oxygen uptake rate.  
For abiotic  conditions  𝑞𝑋∗𝑋=0 and the equation can be integrated to:  
ln (𝐶∗−𝐶)=𝑘𝐿𝑎∗𝑡          (6 )  
A plot of ln  (𝐶) vs t will give a slope of 𝑘 𝐿𝑎. 
When using polargraphic DO probes for measurements, the following 
equation corrects for probe response lag if the oxygen transfer rate is sufficiently high.  
𝐶=𝐶∗−𝐶0
1−𝜏𝑅𝑇∗𝑘𝐿𝑎∗�𝜏𝑅𝑇∗𝑘𝐿𝑎∗𝑒−𝑡
𝜏𝑅𝑇−𝑒−𝑘𝐿𝑎∗𝑡�           (7) 
Where , 𝜏 is the electrode response time and C is the measured oxygen concentration. 
It can be seen from Eqn. 7 that the first term in brackets is becomes negligible as t 
increases and for smaller values of  𝜏𝑅𝑇(i.e.𝑒−𝑡
𝜏𝑅𝑇→0).  
The elect rode response time, 𝜏𝑅𝑇, is used to determine if this correction 
equation is required.  𝜏𝑅𝑇 is the experimentally recorded time for a probe to measure a 
step change in concentration up to 63.2% of the final value (Tribe et al., 1995) . If 𝜏  is 
of the  same order of magnitude as 1
𝑘𝐿𝑎 then the correction equation should be used 
(Van’t Riet, 1979) . For example, if the 𝑘 𝐿𝑎= 0.01 s−1 then 1
𝑘𝐿𝑎 = 100 s which is  
almost  two orders of magnitude greater tha n the typical response time in most cases:  𝜏 
≈ 5-6 s. ALRs and BLRs with only aeration and no mechanical mixing produce 𝑘𝐿𝑎 
values between 0.0027 and 0.0277 s-1, which corresponds to 1/ 𝑘𝐿𝑎 values from 360 
and 60, respectively. Thus , for 𝑘𝐿𝑎 ≤ 0.0277 s-1, probe response lag can be neglected. 
The correction equation can also be avoided if the first 30% of DO concentration data  
is truncated (Merchuk et al., 1990) .  
17 
 Measurement of 𝑘 𝐿𝑎 with respiring biological components active in the media 
is more involved.  When reporting the 𝑘 𝐿𝑎 of a biological system, the volumetric 
mass transfer coefficient is written with a capital K (i.e.  𝐾𝐿𝑎) to signify the presence 
of  third dispersed phase (in this case the fungus). When the oxygen concentration 
cannot be increased from  low level s, such as when the fungal OUR is greater than the 
OTR,  a modification to the dynamic method has been developed. This method use s 
varying concentrations of oxygen in the inlet streams  (i.e. air and pure oxygen) , which 
will produce two pseudo steady- states fo r which  𝐾 𝐿𝑎 can be determined  (Garcia -
Ochoa and Gomez, 2009) . This method is useful for on- line 𝐾𝐿𝑎 measurements when 
microbes present in the bioreactor cannot tolerate low oxygen levels, or the normal aeration cannot sustain a detectable DO concent ration (i.e. DO = 0%)  
Another  method to determine the 𝐾 𝐿𝑎 in bioactive fermentation is to 
determine a mass balance of the inlet and outlet air streams ( 𝐹𝑂2𝑖𝑛,𝐹𝑂2𝑜𝑢𝑡) near steady 
state (𝑑𝐶𝑂2
𝑑𝑡=0). Any oxygen loss in the air therefore is c ontributed to transfer to the 
media or oxygen uptake by the organism.  A third probe in the liquid can determine 
the steady -state liquid oxygen concentration (𝐶𝐿). Finally:  
𝐾𝐿𝑎=𝐹𝑂2𝑖𝑛−𝐹𝑂2𝑜𝑢𝑡
𝑉∗(𝐶∗− 𝐶)          (8) 
Where , 𝑉 is volume of the reactor.  For very small reactors where there are minute 
changes in 𝐹𝑂2𝑖𝑛 and 𝐹𝑂2𝑜𝑢𝑡, very sensitive oxygen probe for the gas streams is required. 
On the other hand, if the liquid volume is large and a significant amount of oxygen is 
transferred to  the liquid media  from the bubble, less sensitive equipment is needed.   
18 
 There are even more developed chemical and physical methods for 
determining 𝑘𝐿𝑎 outside the conventional methods. Pedersen et al. (1994) also 
reported using radioisotopes for 𝑘 𝐿𝑎measurement. However, these methods are 
undesirable  for fungal growth experiments because of the toxic effect  on fungal 
growth and unknown reactions with solutes in vinasse.  
2.5  Modeling the volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient  
Numerous authors ha ve proposed models for predicting  𝑘𝐿𝑎 in ALRs and 
BLRs ( Kantarci et al, 2005 ; Garcia- Ochoa and Gomez, 2009) . Most models require 
the knowledge of many physical and operation parameters including: Diffusivity, 
viscosity, density, superficial gas velocity, and gas hold- up (𝐷,𝜇,𝜌,𝑣,𝜀).  Garcia -
Ochoa and Gomez (2009) presented the general form of predicting  𝑘𝐿𝑎 by taking the 
common terms from multiple researchers’ empirical equations for ALRs and BLRs:  
𝑘𝐿𝑎=𝑐∗𝑣𝑠𝑎∗𝜇𝑎𝑏          (9 ) 
Where , 𝐶,𝑎,𝑏 are empirical constants, 𝑣 𝑠is superficial gas velocity, and 𝜇 𝑎 is apparent 
viscosity. Values for 𝐶 and 𝑎  in pure water have been determined: 𝑐=0.47,𝑎=0.82 
(Deckwer et al., 1974, 1983) . When the fluid is non- Newtonian, apparent viscosit y 
influences the calculation. Godbole et al. (1984) report ed values between - 0.8 and - 1 
for the exponent 𝑏.  Geometric properties, such as height and diameter of the 
bioreactor, have less influence on prediction of 𝑘 𝐿𝑎 in ALRs and BLRs because they 
do not affect the boundary layer between the air bubble and the liquid stream.  
2.6  Biological Enhancement Factor  
The biological enhancement factor,  𝐸, is a phenomenon that either increases or 
decreases 𝑘𝐿𝑎 because of a microorganism physical presence and  oxygen uptake rate.  
19 
 𝐸 is defined as the ratio of oxygen mass transfer rate in the presence of cells 𝐾 𝐿𝑎 to 
the oxygen mass transfer rate without cells,  𝑘𝐿𝑎.  
𝐸=𝐾𝐿𝑎
𝑘𝐿𝑎           (10) 
When the cell concentration is high enough, the bubbles do not interact with the bulk 
liquid velocity. Instead, they are exposed to the microorganism first (along with a thin surfactant layer) and the film resistance changes due to this phenomenon  (Garcia -
Ochoa et al., 2010) . A model predicting 𝐸  was proposed by Garcia -Ochoa and Gomez 
(2005):  
𝐸=�1+𝑞
𝑋𝐶𝑋,𝑚
2𝐷𝑚(𝐶∗−𝐶)∗�1+2∗𝑧𝐿𝐷𝑚
𝑧𝑚𝐷𝐿+2𝑧𝐿2
3𝑧𝑚2�+1
3𝑞𝑋𝐶𝑋,𝐿𝑧𝐿2
2𝐷𝐿(𝐶∗−𝐶𝐿)�∗�𝑧𝐿
𝐷𝐿
∑𝑧𝑖
𝐷𝑖𝑖�  (11)  
Where 𝐶 𝑥,𝑚 and 𝐶𝑥,𝐿 are the cell concentrations in the monolayer and stagnant liqui d 
layer, respectively. Where 𝑞𝑂2 is the specific oxygen uptake rate and 𝐶 𝐿 is the oxygen 
concentration in the liquid. 𝑧 𝑖 and 𝐷𝑖 are the film thicknesses and diffusivities, 
respectively. This model predicts that 𝐸  will increase for increases in bot h cell 
concentrations and cell specific oxygen uptake rates.  The value of E  has been 
reported to range from 0. 9 to 2 for bacterial cultures.  (Garcia -Ochoa and Gomez, 
2005). However no fungal enhancement factors have been reported.  
2.7  Volumetric Surface A rea, Air Bubble Size, Gas Bubble Velocity, 
Kinematic Viscosity, and Diffusivity  
Many of the physical properties are functions of the operational parameters and other 
physical properties. For example if you decrease your bubble size you will increase your surface area and increase your gas hold up. Bubble size is a function of sparger  
20 
 type, aeration rate, physical properties  of the broth, and biomass properties. Bubble 
size is very difficult to maintain uniform throughout a fungal fermentations , however 
average bubble size equations have been deemed sufficient for calculating the 
volumetric surface area, 𝑎.  Smaller bubbles have an increased surface area to volume 
ratio, which enhances the exposed interface between gas and liquid.  Reducing bubble 
size will generally lead to increases in 𝑎  and thus increases in 𝑘𝐿𝑎 in pure water. 
Kantarci et al ( 2005)  proposed an equation relating the superficial area to gas hold up 
and bubble diameter :  
𝑎𝑠=6𝜀
𝑑𝑠           (12)  
For solution s with contaminants or substances that can adhere to the gas- liquid 
monolayer, Vasconcelos et al. (2003) hypothesized and tested that smaller bubble 
radii can decrease 𝑘𝐿from the  resist ance caused by rigid interfaces at the rear of rising 
bubbles. Thus, when there is physical blocking in the media, l arger bubbles have 
greater 𝑘𝐿 due to a more mobile interface with the liquid. Vasconcelos et al. (2003) 
presented theoretical equations for  𝑘𝐿𝑟𝑖𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝑘𝐿𝑚𝑜𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑒: 
 𝑘𝐿𝑟𝑖𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑=0.6�𝑣𝑆
𝑑𝐷2
3
𝜈16            (13)  
 𝑘𝐿𝑚𝑜𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑒=1.13�𝑣𝑆
𝑑𝐷12           (14) 
From these equations, the effects of slip velocity, (𝑣𝑆), kinematic viscosity,( 𝜈), bubble 
diameter, ( 𝑑), and gas diffusivity, (𝐷), can be observed. Slip velocity, (𝑣𝑆) is defined 
as 𝑣𝑆=𝑣𝐺
𝜀−𝑢𝐿, where 𝑣𝐺 and 𝑢𝐿 are superficial air bubble velocity and free stream 
liquid velocity, respectively.   
21 
 Although bubble size and film resistance is an important parameter for fungal 
fermentations, calculating the lumped parameter 𝑘𝐿𝑎 does not require calculating the 
two individual separately. On the other hand, many experiments will calculate the 
lumped parameter first, estimate one of the parameters and solve for the last unknown 
(i.e.  𝑘𝐿=𝑘𝐿𝑎
𝑎). The importance of c alculating the individual parameter a is that 
researchers can pinpoint the changes in 𝑘 𝐿𝑎 to either 𝑘𝐿 or 𝑎 . For example if a can be 
estimated, a researcher can test how a bioreactor component such as decreased 
sparger orifice affects 𝑘𝐿, independe ntly from a.  
2.8  Gas Hold Up  
Gas hold up is a measurement of the colloidal entrapment of gas within the 
liquid phase. This entrapment of gas adds volume to the bioreactor working volume 
and is defined generally as 𝜀 =∆𝑉
𝑉𝑜+∆𝑉, where ∆𝑉 is the volume change after aeration 
and 𝑉𝑜 is the volume without aeration. Increase s in gas hold up are due to many 
physical, geometric, and operational conditions and can lead to increases in k La due to 
increases in  interfacial time as well as volumetric interfacial area, 𝑎. For increases in 
aeration rates, gas hold- up will necessary increase along the equation (Garcia -Calvo 
and Leton, 1991):  
𝜀=𝑣𝑠
𝑈𝑠+1
2𝑉𝐿𝐶+𝑉�𝐿𝑅         (15) 
Where 𝑈 𝑠, 𝑉𝐿𝐶, and 𝑉�𝐿𝑅 are terminal rise velocity of the bubble, average velocity in 
the core region, and average linear velocity, respectively. The consequence of 
increased gas hold up is increased k La, by means of an increase in volumetric 
interfacial area (section 2.7).   
22 
  We have discussed what kLa is, how to measure k La, parameters that affect 
kLa. Now we will discuss problems that occur during bioreactor operation that may 
influence, distort, under -represent or over -represent the k La.   
2.9  Foaming  
Foaming is a primary concern for fungal fermentation in ALRs and BLRs. 
Foaming can lead to lower culture yield due to the organism  being entrapped in the 
foam bubbles  as well as increase risk of contamination . Junker (2007) outlined many 
adverse consequences due t o foaming, such as lower product yield and damage to 
instruments of the reactor.  
The strongest way to mitigate foam is to modify the media being used, most 
often by dilution because dilution lowers the surface tension-- the cause of bubble 
formation. There  are also antifoam reagents and foam breaker methods.  However, the  
addition of antifoams can be toxic to fungal species and foam breaking systems add 
capital and  operation costs to bioreactors  (Junker, 2007) .  
On the other hand, there is a benefit to foam ing. Foaming can increase oxygen 
mass transfer by increasing the volumetric area at the surface, allowing for more 
headspace oxygen mass transfer (Junker, 2007) . Howev er foam that entraps the 
organism must be avoided.  
Higher electrolyte concentrations and lower bubble rise velocities contribute 
to lower bubble coalesc ence at the liquids top surface (Del Castillo et al., 2011). 
Lower bubble coalescence will increase foaming, gas hold up, and the volumetric 
mass transfer coefficient ( 𝑘𝐿𝑎). 
  
23 
 2.10  Yeast Contamination of Vinasse  
Nitayavardhana et al. (2013) discussed yeast contamination of the fungal 
cultivation on vinasse in ALR and BLR (2.5 L) experiments. They  showed that either 
vinasse was not completely sterilized or the yeast was reactivated af ter 8 hours of 
fermentation. A maximal soluble oxygen uptake rate of the contamination was a 
maximum at 24 hours. The yeast cell activation and growth competes for oxygen with 
the fungus  and can transiently change the K La and biological enhancement factor, E . 
It can also be inferred that y east cells also increase  the viscosity  and physical blocking  
of oxygen mass transfer  in vinasse media, reducing K La.  
Junker et al. (2006) outlines sources of contaminations, as well as design and 
procedures for minimizing contamination at the pilot plant scale.  Factors that can 
increase contamination likeliness are: temperature in 20 -40°C range, pH of 5, rich 
complex medium with high nutrients, and high pre -sterilization burden (due to ye ast 
growth for ethanol fermentation ). They suggest nine methods for reducing 
contamination, but many would also kill the fungal species or are not applicable to the industrial fungal processing of vinasse. Two methods to combat contamination would be low dissolved oxygen and addition of antibiotics. Both are unfeasible because 1. lowering DO would cause the aerobic fungal cultivation to collapse 2. Antibiotics are added costs that cannot  be sustained by a co -product generation unit process. In any 
fermentat ion, contamination will lead lower growth rates and fungal yields by a 
competition for nutrients and oxygen. Best efforts should be made to reduce contamination prior to and during fermentation.  
 
  
24 
 2.11  Fungal Grow th for Industrial Fermentations  
The estim ated value of fungal biomass as a feed ingredient  is $515- 1,537 per 
metric ton  (USDA, 2012) . With fungal biomass yield about  3.79 g/L  and 40 billion 
gallons of vinasse available through Brazil’s sugarcane ethanol production ( US DOE, 
2006; Nitayavardhana  et al., 2013;) , the estimated gross value of a fungal 
fermentation unit process could be $11- 32 billion dollars . 
40∗109 𝑔𝑎𝑙∗3.785𝐿
𝑔𝑎𝑙∗3.79 𝑔 𝑏𝑖𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠
𝐿∗1 𝑘𝑔
1000  𝑔∗$515  𝑡𝑜 1537
1000  𝑘𝑔=$11 𝑡𝑜 32 𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑜𝑛  
In order  to realize this unit process, the industrial fermentation must efficient and 
economical.  Lowering the operational costs of fungal fermentation at the industrial 
scale should be a priority. The oxygen mass transfer rate is controlled by the aeration 
rate w hich is the only operation costs other than pumping of liquids in airlift and 
bubble column bioreactors.  Thus an investigation into ways to reduce aeration will lead to a more efficient and less costly fungal fermentation. For  fungal  fermentation 
on a vinasse substrate, there have been no studies which look at the oxygen mass transfer properties in this system. The OTR is governed by the volumetric oxygen 
mass transfer coefficient,  𝑘
𝐿𝑎. Insight into the OTR given by measuring the  𝑘𝐿𝑎 will 
allow aera tion to be tailor ed to the oxygen uptake rate of the fungus. Maintaining the 
minimum aeration for maximal yields will lower operational costs and provide 
maximal profit for a fungal fermentation unit process in ethanol production and vinasse disposal. Opti mal use of vinasse substrate will also reduce the environmental 
impact when the waste water is released into the water table.

 CHAPTER 3 MATERIALS AND METHODS  
3.1  Sugarcane Vinasse Preparation  
The sugarcane vinasse was prepared in the laboratory by ethanol fermentation  
of sugarcane syrup by yeast followed by ethanol recovery.  
3.1.1 Ethanol  Fermentation  
Sugarcane syrup was obtained fresh from Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar 
Company (Puunene, Hawaii, USA) and stored at - 10 °C. The syrup was diluted with 
distilled water to a sugar concentration of 15 g sucrose/g solution ( °brix ) and used as a 
substrate for ethanol fermentation  by yeast .  The pH was adjusted to 4.0 0 ± 0.05 using 
10% ( w/v) NaOH or 10% ( v/v) H 2SO 4. The media was sterilized in an autoclave 
(HICLAVE™ HVE -50, Hirayama, Japan ) for 20 min at 121 °C . 
A 7.5 L stirred tank bioreactor with control unit (Bio Flo 110, New Brunswick 
Scientific Co., Inc., NJ, USA) was used for the ethanol fermentation. The working 
volume was 5.50 L sugarcane syrup media. The bioreactor was  first washed with soap 
and water then all surfaces were sterilized with 70% (v/v) ethanol.  A 1  g/L  inoculum  
was prepared by adding 5.50  g Dry Brewer’s Yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,   
(Muntons Plc., Cedars Maltings, Stowmarket, S uffolt, IP14 2AG, England) to 20 m L 
deionized water. The yeast inoculum was reactivated in an incubator shaker (Inova™4 
230 and Excella E25, New Brunswick Scientific Co., Inc., NJ, USA) for 15 min at 150 rpm at 37 °C.  The reactivated yeast was inoculated to the stirred tank bioreactor at the 0
th hour  with operating conditions of 30 °C, agitation  speed of 300 rpm, and 
aeration rate of 2.5 L min . The pH was maintained at 4.0 using 2% ( w/v) NaOH or 
2% ( v/v) H 2SO 4.  The aerobic fermentation time was 6 hours to allow the yeast  
26 
 population to acclimate and grow.  Anaerobic conditions were impl emented after the 
6th hour.  A eration was removed and the agitation  was reduced to 100 rpm; pH and 
temperature remained constan t. The fermentation beer was collected  after 72 hours.  
3.1.2  Ethanol Recovery  
Distillation of ethanol from the yeast fermentation broth was carried out using 
a rotary evaporator (Rotavapor R -215, Buchi Laborte chnik AG, Flawil, Switzerland). 
The operating c onditions were 50 °C, 120 rpm for 30 min. Ethanol recovery was done 
using ~1 L of fermentation broth at a time. Vacuum pump was used to maintain a 
pressure of 96 kPa  (Nitayavardhana et al., 2013) . Recovered ethanol/water was 
discarded and the remaining fe rmentation broth called vinasse was sterilized via 
autoclave d at 121°C for 20 min and stored at 4 °C until further use  in airlift and 
bubble column reactor experiments.  
3.2  Airlift and Bubble Column Bioreactor Fermentation  
3.2.1  Fungal Spores  
An initial fungal spore suspension of Rhizopus microsporus (var. oligosporus ) 
was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC # 22959, Rockville, 
MD, USA). A stock spore suspension was created by propagating the fungus on sterile potato dextrose a gar Petri dishes (Difco Laboratories, Sparks, MD, USA), and 
the plates were incubated at 24 °C for 5- 7 days; until black fungal spores were formed 
as per protocol reported by Nitayavardhana et al. (2013) . Plated fungal spores were 
harvested with a solution  of 0.1% (w/v) peptone and 0.2% (v/v) Tween 80 (Fisher 
Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ, USA). Then, all the spores harvested were pooled together 
to maintain a homogeneous spore count. Glycerol was added to the harvested spores  
27 
 in a 20% (v/v) before storage at - 20 °C. A 5.28 x 106 spores/ml concentration was 
obtained via hemocytometer (Hausser Scientific, Horsham, PA, USA).  
3.2.2  Fungal Starter  
A 500 mL , 0.2 % (v/v) fungal spore/yeast mold (YM broth) solution was 
prepared for inoculating the bioreactor with fungus. YM broth was prepared via Difco 
following manufacturer’s protocols . Briefly, 10.5 g YM Broth (Difco Laboratories, 
Sparks, MD, USA) was added to 500  m L deionized water in a 1 L Erlenmeyer flask. 
For sterilization, the YM broth was autoclaved for 20 min at 12 1 °C. After the YM 
broth cooled to room temperature, 1 mL stock fungal spore suspension (section 3.2.1 ) 
was added to the sterile media. The fung al starter was incubated in an incubator 
shaker for 72 hours at 3 7 °C and 150 rpm.  
3.2.3  Bioreactor Dimensions and Materials  
A 3.5 L cylindrical column bioreactor was fabricated in- house from clear 
acrylic 0.5 cm thickness. The height of the reactor was 4 0 cm from base to head. The 
inner diameter was 14 cm. For airlift experiments, a circular draft tube (0.5 cm acrylic) was inserted to the bioreactor at 3.5 cm from the base and 17 cm from the head. The draft tube was 16 cm in height, had a 9 cm inner diame ter, and 10 cm outer 
diameter. The resulting riser/downcomer area ratio was 0.96. For bubble column configuration, the draft tube was removed from the same airlift reactor. The air sparger  was located at the center of the base, protruding 3.75 cm above the base, with 
four evenly spaced air diffusers. The air diffusers were Lee's Discard -A-Stone, Fine 
(Lee's Aquarium & Pet Products, San Marcos, CA, USA). Air  was supplied by a liner 
air pump (Super Pond, Kennewick, WA , USA) and regulated with a 65 mm rotameter 
(Omega Engineering Inc., Stamford, CT, USA). Inlet air was filtered through a 0.1  
28 
 µm pore size polytetrafluoroethylene membrane (Whatman, Florham Park, NJ, USA). 
The pH was measured with  a pH probe (#405- DPAS,   Mettler Toledo -Ingold Inc., 
Bedford MA, USA ), controlled by Eutech Instruments pH 200 Series controller 
(Cole -Parmer Instrument Company , Vernon Hills, IL, USA)  and acid and base was 
pumped by a Pulsafeeder® (Punta Gorda, FL, USA). The temperature was maintained 
by submerging the bioreactor in a temperature controlled water bath. Figure 3.1 shows 
a schematic of the bioreactor setup. The superficial gas velocity is calculated below 
for 1.5 vvm.

 3.2.4  Fungal Culture on Vinasse Substrate ( with-fungus)  
The working volume of the fungal fermentation was 2.5 L. A 2.0 L 75% (v/v) 
vinasse media was prepared by diluting 1.5 L vinasse with 0.5 L distilled water. The 
vinasse media was sterilized in an autoclave and added to the bioreactor.  The 500 ml fungal sta rter (section 3.2.2) was added directly (residual YM broth and fungal 
pellets) to the bioreactor. The pH was brought to 5.0 with 10% (w/v) NaOH and maintained by 2% H
2SO 4 or NaOH  solutions. Temperature was maintained at 30° C. 
The reactor working volume wa s constant. No nutrient supplementation was added. 
Airflow was 1.0 vvm until 𝐾𝐿𝑎 measurements were taken.  
𝐾𝐿𝑎 was measured at aeration rates of 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0 vvm. Each 
𝐾𝐿𝑎 measurement was done successively, one after another. Imm ediately after 𝐾 𝐿𝑎  
measurements were done, the reactor was harvested, and a dry weight of fungal biomass was recorded. Different cultivation times were used ( ~12, ~ 24, ~48 hours ) 
and resulted in varying, though not correlated, biomass dry weights. Th is allowed the 
experiment to compare  the changes in 𝐾
𝐿𝑎 versus final biomass dry weight.  
The fungal biomass dry weight was used as indicator of fungal biomass in the 
reactor as the fungus is sponge -like and measurements of wet weight would be 
inaccurate. The fungal biomass was harvested ( after 𝐾 𝐿𝑎 measurements)  by passing 
the fermentation b roth over a #60 sieve (VWR, Radnor, PA, USA). The fungal 
biomass was dried at 70 °C for 48 hours  or until a constant weight was achieved.  
3.2.5  Water -only Operation  
The working volume for water only experiments was 2.5 L. All initial factors 
(pH, temperat ure, sterility) but one were identical to the ‘With -fungus’ (section 3.2.4)  
30 
 experiments. Instead of vinasse media, 2.5 L distilled water was used as the control 
media for determining baseline oxygen mass transfer properties of the bioreactor 
configuration.  
3.2.6  Vinasse- only Operation  
The working volume of vinasse -only experiments was 2.5 L. All initial factors 
(pH, temperature, sterility) but one were identical to the ‘With -fungus’ (section 3.2.4) 
experiments. The fungal starter was replaced with 500 m L sterilized deionized ( DI) 
water. No fungal harvest was needed for these experiments. No maintenance of pH 
was required as well.  
3.3  Analytical Methods  
3.3.1  Dissolved Oxygen Measurement and  Volumetric Mass Transfer 
Coefficient Determination  
The dissolved oxygen was measured with a polargraphic dissolved oxygen 
probe (P0720- 6283, Mettler Toledo- Ingold Inc., Bedford, MA, USA) . The probe was 
placed off- center of the bioreactor, 3 cm above the base  to prevent bubble fouling the 
membrane . The analog dissolved oxygen percent ( DO) was recorded using the BioF lo 
110 controller and the signal was converted to a digital format using a data acquisition card (Measurement Computing  Corporation, Norton, MA, USA) with a sampling rate 
of 1 Hz.  
To determine  𝑘
𝐿𝑎 in water- only and vinasse experiments  according the 
dynamic method ( Section 2.4) , a DO curve was created  (Figure 4.3) . The  DO was 
reduced to a low value (0- 40%) using nitrogen gas sparged through the air diffuser. 
The air was introduced at the low DO level simulta neously with the closure of the  
31 
 nitrogen supply (using a T joint and ball valves). The DO was allowed to reach its 
saturation point and the experiment was repeated to obtain n ≥3.  
3.3.2  Volumetric Mass Transfer Coefficient C alculations  
The DO (% saturation) curves were imported as delimited  values into Excel 
2007 (Microsoft C orporation, Redmond, WA, USA). For water- only and vinasse -only 
experiments, a scatter plot of ln (1−𝐷𝑂) vs. time (s) was created to linearize the 
curve according to E qn. 6. To take into account the oxygen uptake rate by the fungus, 
the maximum oxygen concentration, 𝐶 𝑚𝑎𝑥, replaces 𝐶∗ in Eqn. 6. For with -fungus 
experiments, a scatter plot of 𝑙𝑛 (𝐶𝑚𝑎𝑥−𝐷𝑂) vs time (s) was created to linearize the 
curve according to dynamic method for 𝑘 𝐿𝑎 calculations. A linear regression line was 
fitted in Excel 2007 a nd the slope =  −𝑘𝐿𝑎 for each case. 𝑘 𝐿𝑎 was recorded in s-1 and 
converted to h-1 by multiplying by 3600 𝑠
ℎ.  
For water -only, ALR and BLR configurations, 𝑘𝐿𝑎 values were fit with a 
power regression according to the model . The coefficient and exponent was found for 
a modified Eqn. 9 ( Section 2.5) which we have lumped the apparent viscosity term 
into t he coefficient, c , since there was no physical changes to the media during these 
measurements:  
𝑘𝐿𝑎=𝑐∗𝑣𝑣𝑚𝑎          (16)  
Where 𝑐  is a proportionality constant with units 𝑚𝑖𝑛
ℎ , 𝑣𝑣𝑚  is the aeration rate in 𝐿
𝐿
𝑚𝑖𝑛 
and 𝑎  is empirical consta nt.

 3.3.3  Statistical Analysis and Measurement Error  
Sample variance was checked for consistency with an F -test in order to 
assume equal variance for the t -test. One-way analys es of variance, t -test assuming 
equal variance was performed on between group measurements.  A confidence interval 
of 0.05 was used. Excel 2007 Analysis Toolpack Add- in (Microsoft Corporation, 
Redmond, WA, USA) was used for this analysis.

 CHAPTER 4  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
4.1  Rationale  
Vinasse is a highly complex m edium with many organic and inorganic solutes 
(Nitayavardhana and Khanal , 2010). Complex solutes in solution can have a 
detrimental effect on bioreactor properties such as viscosity, density, gas hold up, 
foaming, and additional resistance in the liquid fi lm resistance. In order to determine 
the effects of these so lutes on oxygen mass transfer, baseline  𝑘𝐿𝑎 values for water -
only and vinasse -only fermentations was needed for comparison. A water -only 
control curve of 𝑘 𝐿𝑎 values at varying aeration rates  will prove useful  when 
determining if further studies  on solute effects on 𝑘 𝐿𝑎 are warranted.  
𝑘𝐿𝑎 values for vinasse -only ALR and BLR configurations are also needed to 
provide  engineers with an idea of the mass transfer properties to expect when vinasse 
is the chosen media. Different aeration rates will promote  different 𝑘𝐿𝑎 values which 
can be tailored to the oxygen uptake rate of the fungus during fermentation. 
Fungal growth within the bioreactor adds additional complexity to the medium 
and oxygen mass transfer properties. The results from measuring 𝐾 𝐿𝑎 when fungus is 
growing in the reactor will give us information regarding actual effect of live growth on oxygen mass transfer properties.  
The experimental design was to look at abiotic and f ungal systems using ALR  
and BLR configuration s with water and vinasse media. However, there are no results 
for the airlift configuration with vinasse media because there was bioreactor fowling during the fungal fermentation in the ALR configuration with vi nasse media.  In the 
2.5 L airlift bioreactor, it is nearly impossible to prevent plugging of downcomer area  
34 
 when fungal biomass agglomerates. Figure  4.1 is an example of plugged airlift 
bioreactor.  Only a larger area for passage would allow for the agglome rated fungus to 
pass through. Higher she ar rates also cause a more hairy like protrusion of the fungal 
pellet, which was observed visually. During bubble column operation, the pellets were 
able to grow in a denser pellet which prevents fungal biomass agglomeration.

 4.2  Dynamic Method Data and Volumetric Mass Transfer Coefficient 
Calculations  
Dynamic method measurement of DO versus time curves was obtained for 
𝑘𝐿𝑎 calculations (Section 3.3.2). At least three  peaks were obtained for each 
configuration. The configurations obtained are summarized in Figure 4.2. Fungal 
biomass fouling in the space between the side wall and draft tube is consistent with 
the findings of Nitayavardhana et al. (2013). Fungal biomass was also found to foul 
the DO probe by attaching at the tip, preventing a steady stream of bulk liquid to pass over the membrane. A consequence of reactor plugging and DO probe fouling is that no airlift data for with -fungus and vinasse- only are presented for this research.  There 
are methods discussed to combat this issue in Chapter 6.

Dissolved oxygen versus time plots were obtained from the ALR and BLR 
configurations at varying aerations rates for water -only. A typical DO versus time 
curve is presented in Figure 4.3. The downward sloped data were  obtained during 
nitrogen sparging and the upward sloping data w ere obtained during air sparging. Water -only

 Next, at least 30 data points were used  to plot ln(1- DO) versus time. A linear 
regression gave the values of  𝑘𝐿𝑎. A typical linear curve for 𝑘 𝐿𝑎 calculations is 
presented in Figure 4.4. The 𝑘𝐿𝑎 and  𝐾𝐿𝑎 values f or all experiments are found in 
Tables 4.1-4.5.

 4.3  Water -only Airlift and Bubble Column V olumetric O xygen M ass 
Transfer C oefficient  
Water -only ALR and BLR 𝑘𝐿𝑎 values are presented in Table s 4.1 and 4.2. A 
scatter plot of 𝑘𝐿𝑎 values  versus aeration rate for air lift and bubbl e column 
configurations using water is shown in Figure 4.5. The plot shows that for 0.5 to 2.0 
vvm, airlift and bubble column configurations share similar 𝑘𝐿𝑎 values. A t -test 
performed for each aeration rate confirmed no statistical difference (p ≤0.05) between 
the two configurations at each aeration rate, excluding 3.0 vvm.  
The range for 𝑘 𝐿𝑎 values in ALR configuration was 17.1 ±  1.5 h-1 for 0.5 vvm 
to 100.8  ±  4.2 h-1 for 3.0 vvm. The range for 𝑘 𝐿𝑎 values in BLR configuration was 
18.0 ±  0.6 h-1 for 0.5 vvm to 79.4  ±  2.2 h-1 for 3.0 vvm. Figures 4.6 and 4.7 shows a 
power regression between aeration rates 0.5 to 2.0 vvm for both configurations, with 
the best -fit equations being:  
𝑘𝐿𝑎𝐴𝐿𝑅 = 37.9∗𝑣𝑣𝑚0.949 ;𝑅² = 0.9748  
𝑘𝐿𝑎𝐵𝐿𝑅 = 39.0∗𝑣𝑣𝑚0.941 ;𝑅² = 0.9754  
These power regressions correspond to the model, Equation 16 , with 𝑐 =37.9 and 
𝑎=0.949 for ALR and 𝑐 =39.0 and 𝑎 =0.941 for BLR. Both exponents are less 
than 1, comparable to Deckwer et al. (1983) who reported values for a between 0.72 
and 1.28 for saline solutions  in a bubble column. The different units of 𝑣𝑠 and vvm 
will cause the proportionality constant c  to be dissimilar to Deckwer et al., however 
the two variables can be interchanged based on knowledge of the volume and cross sectional area of the bioreactor: 𝑣
𝑠=𝑣𝑣𝑚∗𝑉/𝐴𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 .

 4.4  Vinasse- only Bubble Column Reactor Volumetric Oxygen Mass Transfer 
Coefficient  
Vinasse- only BLR 𝑘𝐿𝑎 values are presented in Table 4.3.  A maximum 𝑘 𝐿𝑎 of 
59.4 ±  1.9 h-1 was achieved at 3.0 vvm. All vinasse -only BLR 𝑘 𝐿𝑎 values were  
statistically lower (p ≤0.01) when compared to water -only BLR  𝑘𝐿𝑎 value, with a 
mean difference of 34.1 ±  17.7 % lower than the water- only value. Results from 
statistical analyses can be found in T able A.1. 
Figure 4.8 shows a  scatter plot of 𝑘 𝐿𝑎 values versus aeration rates  for BLR 
configurations using vinasse -only. The S -curve type pattern suggests that at lower 
aeration rates, 0.5 to 1.25 vvm , 𝑘𝐿𝑎 is suppressed and that as aeration incr eases 
greater than 1.25 vvm 𝑘𝐿𝑎 tapers off to a maximum. The cause of lower 𝑘𝐿𝑎 at lower 
aerations could be due to a multitude of factors including lower bubble rise velocity 
which increases the stagnant boundary layer, less bubbles which reduces the  mixing 
force and turbulence which reduces  gas hold up.   
There were no experiments which measured the 𝑘𝐿𝑎 values for aeration rates 
greater than 1.5 vvm because of the detrimental effects shea ring h ad on fungal 
biomass  morphology/ yield (Nitayavardhana et al., 2013). However, the optimization 
experiments  of Nitayavardhana et al. (2013) only studied 1.5 and 2.0 vvm. Possible 
future experiments could investigate if there is a more optimal aeration rate above 1.5 
vvm and below 2.0 vvm, such as 1.75 vvm. Thi s being said, u nderstanding that 
increasing aeration will not increase 𝑘𝐿𝑎 proportionally is important. While  increased 
aeration increases power consumption  (Blanch and Clark, 1997) , there is a lso a limit 
to increasing 𝑘 𝐿𝑎 simply by increasing the aeration rate.  This knowledge directly  
44 
 impact costs consideration for commercial processes looking to increase oxygen mass 
transfer  by increasing aeration rate (Mueller et al., 2002).

 5.82 g and 18.8% increase  at 1.5 vvm . It is important to highlight that for 6.53 g, the 
highest 𝐾𝐿𝑎 measured at 62.3 h-1 is also significantly different from the mean water -only 
1.5 vvm value, 55.2 h-1.  Table A.2 presents the statistical analysis for these claims.  
When interpreting these results it is important to take into consideration the 
oxygen uptake rate of the fungus and yeast in the bioreactor. Higher biomass 
concentration and/or high specific oxygen uptake rate can increase the oxygen uptake 
rate. Both of these factors increase 𝐾𝐿𝑎 according to Eqn. 11. This suggests that for 5.82 
g and 6.53 g there was biologi cal enhancement  by either fungal biomass or yeast 
contamination. In Figure 4.9 the first five 𝐾𝐿𝑎 values, which include 5.82 g and 6.53 g, 
correspond to growth times between 12- 24 hours. This suggest s that the fungus (and/or 
yeast) had significant speci fic oxygen uptake rate to increases 𝑘 𝐿𝑎because compared to 
higher biomass concentrations, 7.89 and 7.39 g, there was no significant biological enhancement over 𝑘
𝐿𝑎.  
There was significant reduction ( -14.1%) in oxygen mass transfer at the 7.39 g 
and 48 h of cultivation. This however does not rule out that 𝑘𝐿𝑎 was increased by 
microbe OUR. It does however, mean that other factors reduced more than it was enhanced by microbe OUR. 𝐾
𝐿𝑎 is also dependent  on other transient factors such as broth 
viscos ity, bubble coalescence, bubble size, among others. This means  that for instances 
where there is no ne or reduced biological enhancement, there are other reducing forces  
acting in tandem with microbe OUR. Observations during bioreactor operation such as 
increase bubble coalescence from the converging streamtubes caused by fungal biomass 
is present in the medium  or increased broth viscosity from fungal and yeast cell biomass 
are possible causes of reduced 𝑘 𝐿𝑎.  
48 
 Physical blocking effects by the fungal  and ye ast cells likely  cause the reduction 
in 𝐾𝐿𝑎 for fungal fermenation. For the fungal biomass dry weights 7.89 and 7.39 g, t he 
fungus was harvested at or near the maximum biomass dry  weight  in this  batch 
experiment —harvested at or after 48 h of cultivation  (Nitayavardhana et al., 2013) . If 
growth is limited  at this time , this could mark a l ower specific oxygen uptake rate which 
would correspond to lower biological enhancement. In addition, observations suggest that 
higher fungal biomass concentrations lead to increased bubble coalescence, increased contact with fungal pellets, and decreased physical contact with the bulk liquid. Increased 
apparent viscosity could have  also lowered  the 𝐾
𝐿𝑎. More studies are needed to 
differentiate between physical blocking and OUR consequences  on 𝑘𝐿𝑎 variance in 
fungal fermentation.  
It was not possible to do 𝐾 𝐿𝑎 calculations past 48 hours of fermentation because 
oxygen uptake rate (Fungus and Yeast) would be greater tha n oxygen mass transfer 
leading to negative oxygen flux ( Eqn. 5). When the oxygen flux is negative, the dynamic 
method is incapable of measuring  𝐾𝐿𝑎. Pure oxygen was unavai lable for this research, 
future experiments might consider  using pure oxygen supplementation to investigate 𝐾 𝐿𝑎 
when oxygen uptake rate outpaces oxygen mass transfer.  
4.5  Observations 
4.5.1  Airlift Reactor and Sparger Fouling  
Bioreactor fowling during ALR operation caused results to be unreliable. During 
ALR operation, fungal biomass clumps would lodge in the spa ce between the inner  
49 
 reactor wall and draft tube. Fungal biomass also grew on and around the air diffusers as 
shown in Figure 4.10.  
 
Figure 4.10 Air diffuser fouling in airlift reactor 
DO probe fouling occurred when either bubbles or fungal biomass adhere s to the 
oxygen membrane. This leads to either erratic DO readings or false 𝐾𝐿𝑎 values. Possible 
solutions to this problem is  to orient the DO probe membrane away from the liquid 
stream direction so the membrane does not create a stagnation point for bubbles or fungal clumps. A mesh could also be used to cover the membrane and prevent particulates from clogging the liquid/membra ne interface.  
 
 
50 
 4.5.2  Foaming  
Foaming occurred at all aeration rates utilizing vinasse as a substrate (i.e. vinasse -
only and fungal fermentations). If aeration rates were greater than 1.0 vvm  at the 
beginning of fermentation, foaming would be excessive —filling the foam trap, 
entrapping the fungal pellets in the foam layer, and depositing pellets to the sidewalls, 
cap, and foam trap. Foaming could be controlled by keeping the aeration rate low during 
the beginning of the fungal cultiva tion (t<12- 24 h). A chem ical analysis of the vinasse 
before and after aeration should be done to verify what molecules are present before and after sterilization to confirm the claims by Junker (2007) . After 12 -24 hours of lower 
aeration, the aeration was increased to 1.5 vvm and the bioreactor had a stable foam height.  
Junker (2007) notes that foam can be increased in the presence of cells due to 
increasing foam stability. In order to rule out the yeast cells as t he cause for excessive 
foaming, yeast cells were removed by sedimentation. Even after yeast cell removal, the 
supernatant vinasse would still foam excessively at high aeration rates. This suggests that it is the soluble components of vinasse, sugars and et hanol left over from ethanol 
fermentation, cause excessive foaming in vinasse. Junker (2007) noted that 1- 22% 
glucose concentrations stabilize foam and that sugar containing medias foam excessively when sterilized with high temperature treatment.  Van't Rei t and Tramper  (1991)  report ed 
that foaminess is a maximum at 1 -2% (v/v) short chain alcohols.   
51 
 CHAPTER 5 CONCLUSIONS  
This research investigated the volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient, 
𝑘𝐿𝑎 and  𝐾𝐿𝑎, in abiotic and fungal fermentation. The fungus grew in a bubble column 
bioreactor with vinasse as the substrate. Nitayavardhana et al. (2013) reported 1.5 vvm 
being the optimal aeration rate and this research measured an oxygen mass transfer 
coefficient for the same aera tion rate, with results ranging from 40.9 ±  2.6 h-1 to 62.2 ±  
0.8 h-1. These values are in the comparable to  previous BLR experiments within the same 
superficial gas velocity (Vandu and Krishna, 2004) . Conditions were identical to 
Nitayavardhana et al . (2013) with the exception that there was no nutrient 
supplementation in this research . The deciding factor for whether nutrient 
supplementation should be used is an economic analysis, which should be done in the future.  
In an effort to be familiar with how a eration rate affects 𝑘
𝐿𝑎 in the bioreactor, the 
research measured water -only and vinasse -only 𝑘𝐿𝑎 values for varying aeration rates in 
the range of 0.5 to 3.0 vvm. We obtained empirical equations for ALR and BLR configurations using water -only media:  
𝑘
𝐿𝑎𝐴𝐿𝑅 = 37.9∗𝑣𝑣𝑚0.949 ;𝑅² = 0.9748  
𝑘𝐿𝑎𝐵𝐿𝑅 = 39.0∗𝑣𝑣𝑚0.941 ;𝑅² = 0.9754  
These equations are a guide to determining the  range of 𝑘 𝐿𝑎 values for a ny aeration rate  
within the range of aeration rates for this experiment (0.5 to 2.0 vvm) . Future  
experiments  should test the  robustness at  aeration rates between this experiment’s 
measurements (i.e. 1.33 vvm)  to validate the model’s robustness . While the model is  
52 
 based on using superficial gas  velocity a successfully scaled -up BLR experiment by 
Deckwer et al. (1974), the geometry of the BLR does not allow these specific equations 
based on vvm to be used during scale -up. However, using the method from this research 
to determine a relationship based on aeration rate should be done before the act ual fungal 
fermentation to give a range of 𝑘 𝐿𝑎 values at each aeration rate.  
Vinasse- only experiments did not show power curves at lower aeration rates. On 
the other hand, we observed a logistical growth curve —exponential increasing at first 
then approa ching a limiting value. The  minimum 𝑘 𝐿𝑎 was 10.1 ±  0.2 h-1 at 0.5 vvm and 
maximum 𝑘𝐿𝑎 of 59.4 ±  1.9 h-1 at 3.0 vvm for  the BLR configuration. When comparing 
water -only to vinasse -only aeration rates for BLR configuration, it was shown that 𝑘𝐿𝑎  
for vinasse media was on average 34.1±  17.7 % lower than water. The reduction in 
oxygen mass transfer is very significant, as good dissolved oxygen levels are crucial for 
promoting high biomass yields.  
This research did not investigate the exact cause o f the decreases  in 𝑘𝐿𝑎. It was 
not feasible to conduct enough controlled studies to determine the independent causes of 
reduced 𝑘𝐿𝑎 values, such as changes in bubble size, viscosity, and gas hold -up. More 
research is needed to determine the underlyin g causes that reduce  𝑘𝐿𝑎. Through 
observations, we suspected that low oxygen mass transfer was  a limiting factor to fungal 
growth. This researched did determine that the presence of fungal biomass (and yeast 
cells) can enhance or  reduce 𝐾 𝐿𝑎 at certai n stages of growth. If the fungal biomass is high 
in concentration and specific oxygen uptake rate, 𝐾 𝐿𝑎 will be enhanced  in this situation . 
However , if the fungal biomass is in a declin ing phase of growth, and there is a lower 
OUR, the factors that redu ce 𝐾𝐿𝑎 will outweigh the increases due to OUR  (Kilonzo and  
53 
 Margaritis, 2004) . Yeast contamination may also enhance 𝐾𝐿𝑎, however a sterilization 
study needs to be done to confirm overall effects of yeast cells on 𝐾𝐿𝑎. 
We did not investigate the ALR configuration for vinasse media because we 
observed reactor fouling and fungal pellet clumping in this configura tion. Chapter 6 
discusses possible solutions and future research with airlift reactors.  
The objective to obtaining a  standard curve of  𝑘𝐿𝑎 values for varying aeration 
rates through empirical methods was successful. This is the first step in plan ning a 
commercial fungal fermentation  unit process . Armed with  this knowledge of oxygen 
mass transfer in fungal fermentation, engineers and future rese archers can  possibly tailor 
aeration rates to match the fungal oxygen uptake rate. This will allow engineers to set 
optimal growth conditions of minimizing  shear and maintaining  sufficient  DO levels 
resulting in the most efficient bioreactor operation. Fin ally, by reducing the aeration costs 
for fungal fermentation, it will further increase the chances for the unit process to replace the traditional method of disposing vinasse directly into the environment.  
54 
 CHAPTER 6 FUTURE RESEARCH AND DIRECTIONS  
This research investigated oxygen mass transfer in airlift and bubble column 
bioreactors growing a mycelia fungus on a complex liquid biofuel residue , vinasse. It als o 
focused on the effects of aeration on the volumetric oxygen mass transfer 
coefficient s, 𝑘𝐿𝑎 and 𝐾𝐿𝑎. However, there are variables other than aeration that influence 
 𝑘𝐿𝑎 and 𝐾𝐿𝑎 values. Future research should include:  
1. The effects of transient changes in broth viscosity on 𝐾 𝐿𝑎.  Broth viscosity can be 
reduced by the uptake and utilization of sugars in vinasse  during fungal 
fermentation . This would lead to increased  𝐾𝐿𝑎. However, reduced sugar levels 
correspond to increase d fungal biomass concentrations and yeast concentrations, 
which are likely to increase broth viscosity. A n investigation into effluent vinasse 
compared to influent vinasse broth viscosity should be done .  
2. The effects of bubble sizes on fungal yields and other bioreactor performance 
measures. Bubble size has a dramatic effect on oxygen mass transfer as well as other fermentation conditions such as bubble rise velocity, she ar rates, and bulk 
mixing. Effects for different spargers and aeration rates should be investigated for effects on bioreactor performance and fungal biomass yield.  
3. An investigation to fungal c ultivation in a larger ALR . The ALR can improve 
mixing and increase gas hold- up. However due to fungal growth, the oxygen mass 
transfer could not be investigated for the 2.5 L ALR used in this experiment. 
Future experiments should scale up and include larger ALR designs, which can 
have larger spaces in downcomer and riser sections.  Fungal pellets have limited 
maximal size, while the downcomer and riser sections will increase with scale -up,  
55 
 which should prevent fouling and allow for 𝐾𝐿𝑎 measurements.  DO p robe 
placement with the membrane  pointing in the same direction as the liquid flow 
(i.e. right side up in the downcomer or upside down in the riser) will prevent 
probe fouling by preventing fungal attachment and bubble entrapment. 
4. Currently no method is available to characterize the cell concentration filamentous fungi. This makes prediction of the biological enhancement factor nearly impossible. A method needs to be developed that measures the specific oxygen uptake rate based on fermentation time  
5. Use of  other methods to improve 𝐾
𝐿𝑎 . 𝐾𝐿𝑎 can be improved by using 
mechanically agitating  ALRs and BLRs or using hollow -fiber membranes for 
oxygen mass transfer.  Nevertheless, precautions to prevent morphology changes and fouling should be planned before entering into these advanced methods of oxygen mass transfer.  
6. An economic analysis of aeration costs should be investigated to determine if 
scale -up of fungal fermentation is feasible. Larger scale data is also required for 
this analysis.  
7. A costs- benefit analysis of nutrient supplementation should also be investigated to 
determine whether it is appropriate to supplement nutrients. Whether or not to supplement nutrients may affect fungal protein profiles along with macromolecule composition, which impacts t he feed value/potential of the fungal biomass  
8. Regarding vinasse -only operation (Section 3.2.6), 500 mL of YM broth would be 
a better control than 500 mL of water due to solutes present in YM broth for with-fungus experiments.

A.2  The Current State of Ethanol Production   
 Currently, more than 20 billion gallons  of bioethanol is produced annually 
worldwide. Ethanol is a primary replacement for transportation fuel with E10 (10% 
ethanol blends) in 96% of United States gasoline as of 2012. (Renewable Fuels 
Association, 2013) Figure A. 1 shows  the growth ethanol production since 2006.

Figure A.2 US ethanol production from 1980 to 2012 (Renewable Fuels Association, 
2013)  
In an effort to gain energy independence the US government passed the Energy 
Independence and Sec urity Act of 2007. In the legislation, the US is required to increase 
biofuels added to the gasoline supply to 36 billion gallons in year 2022 from 4.7 billion 
gallons in 2007. The legislation also specifies that 22 billion gallons of the biofuel must come  from non -cornstarch products (i.e. sugar and cellulose) (P.L.110- 140, H.R. 6). 
 The legislation lead to the exponential growth of US ethanol production from 
1980 to 2010 (Figure A. 2). However, the past three years, 2010- 2012 has seen the 
production stagna te at nearly 20 billion barrels worldwide, and 14 billion barrels 
domestically.  However, in a 2012 report, the US EIA noted that currently the US ethanol production has met all demand for E10 gasoline (i.e. 10% ethanol blended into petroleum gasoline). It  is now, during a stagnation in ethanol production growth, that the US, and 175 215 350 415 510 617 712 819 831 843 848 866 985 1,154 1,289 1,358 1,088 1,288 1,405 1,465 1,622 1,765 2,140 2,810 3,404 3,904 4,884 6,521 9,309 10,938 13,298 13,948 13,300
