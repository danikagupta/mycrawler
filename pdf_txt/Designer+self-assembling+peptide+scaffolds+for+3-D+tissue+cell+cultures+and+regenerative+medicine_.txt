1. Introduction
A class of designer self-assembling peptide nanoﬁber scaffolds
as a unique biological material has been previously reported tohave diverse and broad applications including for 3-D tissue cellculture, slow drug release, regenerative medicine, and tissueengineering.
1–5This class of self-assembling peptide materials
undergo spontaneous assembly into well-ordered interwovennanoﬁbers, which form hydrogels with about 10 nm ﬁber
diameter, 5–200 nm pore size, and over 99% water content.
6
Moreover, these self-assembling peptides can be modiﬁed and
functionalized by direct extension of peptides with known bio-logically functional peptide motifs to promote speciﬁc cellularresponses. One family of these peptide scaffolds, functionalizedRADA16-I (AcN–RADARADARADARADA–CONH
2) has
been used in bone, cartilage, and neural regeneration, as well asto instantly stop bleeding and have shown great promise.
7–10
One of the primary purposes of tissue regeneration and engi-
neering is to develop biologically compatible substitutes thatreplace damaged or missing body tissues.
11Presently inadequatevascularization developed in tissue-engineered materials has
been a major obstacle for their clinical applications. Becausethe amount of oxygen required for cell survival is limited toa distance of approximately 200 mm from the supplying blood
vessel, long-term survival and function of constructed tissue
substitutes requires new blood vessels to provide nutrients and
oxygen to the cells.
12,13Therefore, an adequate blood vessel
supply to the newly formed tissue and within the transplantedscaffold is thought to be essential in determining the success ofnew tissue regeneration. Promotion of angiogenesis in tissueengineering is always one of the major topics of tissue regener-ation and tissue engineering.
14–18
Angiogenesis refers to the formation of new capillaries from
pre-existing blood vessels, which consists of several complexconsecutive steps, including the stimulation of endothelial cellsby growth factors, the subsequent degradation of extracellular
matrix (ECM) by proteolytic enzymes, proliferation, migration
and invasion of ECM of endothelial cells, and the recruitment ofpericytes stabilizing the newly formed capillary network.
19,20
These steps should be considered during designing tissue-engineered scaffolds. Several kinds of scaffold materialsincluding collagen I, ﬁbrin, Matrigel, and PLGA sponge havepreviously been used for angiogenesis studies.
21–27These studies
focus on different steps of the angiogenesis process and most ofthem strongly depend on the supplement of soluble angiogenicgrowth factors. Although these biological molecules holdsigniﬁcant promise for developing an effective vascular system,their use may be limited in certain applications of these tissue-
engineered scaffolds because of some imperative processesaCenter for Biomedical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of

sterilization. And also the applications of growth factors in vivo
could carry high risks of hyper-stimulation and other unwanted
effects.28Therefore, an ideal angiogenic tissue-engineered scaf-
fold should take into account most representative steps of in vivo
angiogenesis, not only avoid using large amount of prohibitivelyexpensive growth factors, but also still promote capillaryinvasion and survival.
Recently, several peptide molecules have been reported to
modulate angiogenesis.
29RGD is a key binding sequence for cell
attachment speciﬁcally working with integrins. PRGDS andYRGDS are the most commonly appearing RGD motifs innatural proteins.
30,31Here we designed a 2-unit RGD binding
sequence PRGDSGYRGDS with two similar units of RGD
binding sequences, which has a higher possibility to increase cell
attachment and therefore promote endothelial cell long-termsurvival. KLTWQELYQLKYKGI has been reported to act asa vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agonist.
32This
VEGF-mimicking peptide modeled on the VEGF helix region17–25 binds to and activates the VEGF receptors, thus activatingthe VEGF-dependent proliferation pathway and inducingEC proliferation. This is the only example in the literature ofa synthetic peptide able to active VEGF receptors. In our study,these functionalized peptide sequences were directly extendedon the self-assembling peptide RADA16-I through solid phase
synthesis at the C-termini to increase the angiogenic activities of
RADA16-I peptide scaffolds.
We here report an in vitro study of the angiogenic activities of
two designer functionalized self-assembling peptide nanoﬁberscaffolds KLT and PRG, which signiﬁcantly promote endothe-lial cell survival, proliferation, migration, and morphologicaldifferentiation. Our results suggest that the designer functional-ized peptide scaffolds may not only have great promise forpromoting endothelial cell growth, migration, and tubulogenesis,but also may be very useful for tissue engineering and diversetissues regeneration.
2. Experimental
2.1 Peptide solution preparation and gel formation
Peptide solution preparation. All the lyophilized designer
peptides used in this work were custom-synthesized by CPCScientiﬁc (Purity >80%, San Jose, CA). These peptides weredissolved in MilliQ water at a ﬁnal concentration of 1% (w/v,
10 mg ml
/C01) and then sonicated for 30 minutes (Aquasonic,
model 50T, VWR, NJ). After sonication, they were ﬁlter-steril-ized (Acrodisc Syringe Filter, 0.2 mm HT Tuffrun membrane,
Pall Corp., Ann Arbor, MI) for succeeding uses. The designerfunctionalized peptide solutions were mixed in a volume ratio of1 : 1 with 1% pure RADA16-I solution to get 1% functionalizedpeptide mixtures (RAD–PRG or RAD–KLT).
Gel formation for two-dimensional (2-D) cell culture. Desired
number of sterilized culture plate inserts (10 mm diameter, 0.4 mm
Millicell-CM, Millipore, MA) were placed in a 24-well culture
plate with 400 ml culture medium in each well. 100 ml of peptide
solution (functionalized peptide mixtures or pure RADA16-I)was loaded directly into each of the inserts and then incubated forat least 1 hour at 37
/C14C for gelation. 400 ml of culture medium
were very carefully added onto the gel and then incubated on theplate overnight at 37
/C14C. Once the gel was formed, the medium
was carefully removed and changed twice more to equilibrate
the gel to physiological PH prior to plating the cells. A certainnumber of cells in 400 ml of medium was seeded on the top of the
gel and then the insert was moved to a new 12-well culture platewith 800 ml of medium in each well for 2-D cell culture.
Gel formation for three-dimensional (3-D) cell culture. Culture
plate inserts are prepared as described above. Cells were sus-pended in 10% sucrose just before seeding. 20 ml of cell suspen-
sion were quickly mixed with 100 ml of peptide solution and then
the mixture was added into the insert. 400 ml of medium was very
carefully layered onto the gel for gelation. This was then incu-
bated for 10 min at 37
/C14C and then the medium was changed for
another 30 min of incubation. This was then changed twice moreto equilibrate the gel to physiological pH for 3-D cell culture.
Collagen gel and matrigel formation. Rat tail collagen type I
and Matrigel (growth factor-reduced lot) were purchased fromBD Bioscience (Bedford, MA) and prepared according to themanufacturer’s protocols. The same volume (100 ml) of collagen
type I (2.5mg/ml) and Matrigel were also plated on the bottom ofculture inserts and allowed to gel for 30 minutes at 37
/C14C, with
subsequent addition of culture medium.
2.2 Cell culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs)
Primary isolated HUVECs were commercially obtained from
Lonza Inc. (Walkersville, MD) and routinely grown in endo-thelial growth media EGM-2 (Lonza Inc., Walkersville, MD) onregular tissue-culture plates. All the experiments were conductedwith cells between passage 5 and passage 8. Sub-conﬂuent ( /C246/C2
10
4cells per insert) of HUVECs was seeded on the top of the
scaffolds for 2-D cell culture. About 1 /C2105of HUVECs were
suspended in 100 ml of peptide solution for 3-D cell culture.
2.3 Circular dichroism (CD)
Peptide samples were prepared by diluting 1% peptides in water to
a working concentration of 25 mM. Samples were analyzed at room
temperature in a quartz curette with a path length of 0.5 cm and ina wavelength range 195–250 nm and the CD spectra were collected.
2.4 Fluorescence microscopy
Following the experiments, cells on the hydrogels were ﬁxed with
4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.1%Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. Fluorescent Rho-damin phalloidin and SYTOX
/C210Green (Molecular Probes, Eugene,
OR) were used for labeling F-actin and nuclei, respectively. Imageswere taken using a ﬂuorescence microscope (Axiovert 25, ZEISS)
or laser confocal scanning microscope (Olympus FV300).
2.5 DNA content measurement
The number of cells on the scaffolds was determined by the
ﬂuorometric quantiﬁcation of amount of cellular DNA. The
This journal is ªThe Royal Society of Chemistry 2008 Soft Matter , 2008, 4, 2388–2395 | 2389scaffolds with cells were collected for DNA puriﬁcation
(QIAamp DNA Mini Kit, QIAGEN). 100 ml of puriﬁed DNA
sample was mixed with 100 ml DNA binding ﬂuorescent dye
solution (0.5 ml Picogreen reagent in 100 ml TE buffer, Quant-iT/C212
PicoGreen dsDNA Reagent and kits, Invitrogen). The ﬂuores-
cent intensity of the mixed solution was measured with a ﬂuo-rescence spectrometer (Wallace Victor2, 1420 Multi-labelcounter, excitation at 485nm and emission at 510nm, Perkin-Elmer, MA).
2.6 Boundary-sandwiched cell migration assay
Peptide scaffolds were prepared as described above. A schematic
illustration of boundary-sandwiched cell migration assay isshown in Fig. 4B image (a). Approximately 8 /C210
4cells were
seeded on the top of peptide scaffold A and then incubated for6 hours at 37
/C14C with 5% CO 2for cell attachment. Trimmed
quadrate peptide scaffold A with attached cells was inverselyplaced on the surface of peptide scaffold B with cells between twotypes of scaffolds. The scaffolds with cells were cultured at 37
/C14C
for 2 days and then examined with ﬂuorescence microscopy afternuclei staining.
2.7 Statistical analysis
All the data were statistically analyzed to express in the standard
deviation of the mean. The t-test was performed and p< 0.01 was
commonly accepted to be statistically signiﬁcant.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Self-assembly of designer functionalized peptides
The designer peptides sequences and descriptions are listed in
Table 1. These designer peptides PRG and KLT were synthesizedby direct extension from the C-terminal of the self-assemblingpeptide RADA16-I using solid phase synthesis with differentfunctional peptide motifs (Fig. 1a). They were selected from thefunctional domains on several extracellular matrix proteins andcytokines that are shown to have angiogenic activities andpromote endothelial cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration.
Glycine residues were used between the self-assembling motif
(RADA)
4and the functional motif as a space linker for keeping
the ﬂexibility of functional peptides. The pure functionalizedpeptide PRG or KLT undergoes very weak self-assembly andforms a very soft hydrogel, which is difﬁcult to handle for cellculture. Mixing with self-assembling peptide RADA16-I facili-tated their self-assembly and gelation. The most possible reasonis that the functionalized peptide interact with RADA16-I
through the self-assembling motif (RADA)
4. A schematic illus-
tration is shown in Fig. 1b.
Our previous studies have shown that the formation of stable
beta-sheet is very important and necessary for peptides self-assembly and nanoﬁber formation. CD spectra were used toassess the presence of beta-sheets in RADA16-I and peptidemixtures. A typical spectrum for beta-sheet structures witha minimum mole residue ellipticity at 215 nm and a maximum at195 nm was observed for our peptides studies. These function-alized peptide mixtures exhibited similar structural properties tothe RADA16-I sequence (Fig. 1e). The addition of functionalmotif sequences reduced the beta-sheet content of the peptidemixtures, as shown by a decrease in the intensity of mole residue
ellipticity at 215 nm.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force
Microscopy (AFM) examinations also conﬁrm the self-assem-bling nanoﬁber formations. As shown in Fig. 1c and Fig. 1d,uniform and interweaved long nanoﬁbers can be observed in thefunctionalized peptide mixtures, which suggest that the func-tionalized peptides interact with RADA16-I and incorporateinto the nanoﬁbers quite well. We have also investigated thevariations in the nanoﬁber morphologies and diameters of thefunctionalized peptide mixtures as compared with RADA16-I,which also implied the incorporation in these functionalized
peptide mixtures.

3.2 Cell attachment and viability
In order to evaluate the HUVECs viabilities on these function-
alized peptide scaffolds, the same number of cells were seeded onthe top of the different scaffolds and cultured for two days. TypeI collagen gel was used as a positive control. Fig. 2 showed thetypical morphologies of HUVECs on different scaffolds. Theseeded HUVECs exhibit good attachment and higher viability oncollagen I, RAD–PRG and RAD–KLT, whereas RADA16-Iwas less effective for maintaining cell survival. Beyond that, thecell morphology on RAD–PRG is quite similar with that oncollagen gel, suggesting the RGD units in the PRG peptidesigniﬁcantly increase the HUVECs attachment and viability.
3.3 Cell proliferation
We also estimated cell growth on these peptide scaffolds by
examining DNA contents extracted from the scaffolds after
6-hour, 1-day, 2-day, and 3-day culture (Fig. 3). The differences
in DNA contents among different scaffolds can be used toestimate the cell numbers. Cells attached on these scaffolds after6-hour culture showed a better adhesion on the scaffold RAD–PRG. Furthermore, we noted that cells on RADA16-I startedproliferating after 2 days, while they proliferated after 1 day onscaffolds RAD–KLT and RAD–PRG. Beyond that, the cellnumbers on RAD–PRG and RAD–KLT were about 1.5 times asmany as that on RADA16-I. These results suggested that thecells behavior was positively affected by the functional motifs ofPRG and KLT. In contrast, low cell numbers on RADA16-I
indicated the low proliferation rates or low cell viabilities. This
proliferation was also consistent with the morphologic obser-vations from ﬂuorescence microscopy examinations.

thelial cell viability and inhibition of endothelial cell apoptosis.33
Endothelial cell long-term survival is thought to be essentialduring angiogenesis. Previous studies have shown that many ofangiogenic growth factors inhibit endothelial cell apoptosis
34–36
and the adhesion of endothelial cells to the extracellular matrixpromotes endothelial cell survival.
37,38The functional motif of
PRG with two units of RGD binding sequences may havea higher tendency to increase cell attachment and thereforepromotes endothelial cell survival. The functional motif of KLTacts as a VEGF agonist, thus inducing endothelial cell prolifer-ation and inhibiting endothelial cell apoptosis. Therefore,designer functionalized self-assembling peptides PRG and KLT
have a potentially great value for promoting angiogenesis
process in vitro and perhaps in vivo as well. It will be interesting to
combining both PRG and KLT together as a multi-functionscaffold. Further systematic experiments will address this
question.
3.4 Cell Migration
In order to study the preferences of endothelial cells migration in
response to the components of surrounded scaffolds and theimportance of functional peptide motif for guiding cells migra-tion, we designed the clear-boundary sandwich assays to assessendothelial cell migration between two types of peptide scaffolds.As shown in Fig. 4B, endothelial cells plated on the scaffoldsRAD–PRG (Fig. 4B, images a and e) and RAD–KLT (Fig. 4B,images b and f) settled in these scaffolds and no visible migration
towards RADA16-I scaffold was observed. In contrast, cells
seeded on RADA16-I scaffold directionally migrated towardsfunctionalized peptide scaffolds (Fig. 4B, images c, d, g and h).

This journal is ªThe Royal Society of Chemistry 2008 Soft Matter , 2008, 4, 2388–2395 | 2391These experiments unambiguously show the biological impor-
tance of the designer functionalized peptide scaffolds that inducecell directional migrations. This is a very important observation
since there are no additional soluble growth factors in these
scaffolds. These observations suggest the adhesion peptide motifalone can induce cell migration without extract soluble factors.Many factors are involved in cell unidirectional migration,
such as soluble chemoattractants,
39attachment on surrounding
matrix,40,41and perhaps more. In literature reports, endothelial
cell migration is mostly stimulated by growth factors such as
VEGF and bFGF, and also is activated in response to integrinsbinding to ECM component. Our results demonstratedunequivocally that the adhesive interactions governed mainly bythe functional motif of PRG alone promote cell attachmentand migration from RADA16-I to RAD–PRG scaffold, whereasthe VEGF mimicking sequence of KLT may mainly serve thesimilar function of VEGF to regulate endothelial cell migration.Cells seeded on RADA16-I were probably induced by thefunctional motifs of PRG and KLT and migrated to/on thesefunctionalized peptide mixtures scaffolds (Fig. 4A, image b).
More systematic experiments will be carried out to further
address these questions.
3.5 Capillary-like structures formation in 2-D and 3-D models
In the literature, most of the two-dimensional angiogenesis
models where endothelial cells seeded on ﬂat surfaces formcapillary-like structure under certain conditions in a network
pattern with central voids, which mimic vessel wall and
lumen.
42,43In our study, in order to determine if the functional
peptide motifs assembled in the peptide scaffolds could facilitatethe formation of capillary-like structure without supplement ofextra growth factors in EGM-2, sub-conﬂuent monolayer cellswere plated on the surfaces of scaffolds, 1) RAD–PRG, 2) RAD–KLT, 3) collagen-I and 4) Matrigel for cell cultures up to 1 week.
The typical morphologies of cell organizations after 1-day
culture are shown in Fig. 5. It can be clearly seen that HUVECsformed capillary-like structure networks on RAD–KLT andMatrigel (Fig 5). Whereas no cell networks formation were
observed on RAD–PRG, on which cells formed uniformed
attachment similar with those on collagen-I gel (Fig.5). Tofurther determine the time needed for formation of capillary-likestructure and sequential capillary-like structure morphologychanges, cells from 4-hour and 3-day cultures were also exam-ined. The morphology examinations revealed that the capillary-like structure networks started from 4 hours after seeding andcontinued to 3 days (results not shown). We have also observedthe morphologies under the conﬂuent-seeding conditions.Similar capillary-like structure networks were also observed onRAD–KLT and Matrigel scaffolds (results not shown).
In most in vitro angiogenesis models, endothelial cells undergo
morphological differentiation and reorganize into an extensive
network of capillary like structure in both short-term and long-term cultures depending on matrix and culture conditions.
43In
our current studies, HUVECs seeded on designer RAD–KLTscaffold rearranged into capillary-like structure network as earlyas 4 h after seeding and remained intact for up to 3 days, verysimilar to cell behaviors in Matrigel. It is known that Matrigelcontains many growth factors that stimulate capillary-likestructure formation rapidly. In our study, no extra solublegrowth factors were added to the RAD–KLT scaffold. Thisobservation is very signiﬁcant and suggests that capillary-like
structure formation does not completely depend on soluble
factors alone, but the permissive and stimulating scaffolds playa vital role for angiogenesis. The coupled functional peptide

2392 | Soft Matter , 2008, 4, 2388–2395 This journal is ªThe Royal Society of Chemistry 2008motif of KLT showed stimulating effects similar to soluble
growth factor to promote endothelial cell differentiation.
In short-term models, cells sub-conﬂuence was thought to be
necessary for capillary-like structure formation. However in our
study, capillary-like structure formation on RAD–KLT and
Matrigel does not entirely depend on cell-seeding density.RAD–KLT scaffold containing VEGF-mimicking motif quicklyinduced formation of capillary-like structure network indepen-
dent of cell numbers and other soluble growth factors. This isanother important observation.
In addition to 2-D culture, we uniformly encapsulated
HUVECs into the peptide scaffolds for 3-D cell culture. In thisstudy 20 ng ml
/C01of VEGF were added into the EGM-2 to keep
the cells long-term survival (up to 1 week) and to induced celldifferentiation. All types of peptide samples were examined by
laser confocal scanning microscopy after one-day culture. The
typical cell morphologies and 3-D reconstructions were shown inFig. 6. Firstly, it is observed that endothelial cells in 3-D envi-ronment were elongated with many cellular protrusions ratherthan the characteristic cobblestone and ﬂattened morphology.Secondly, endothelial cells also displayed diverse morphologiesin response to different surrounding peptide matrix. Theyadopted a more spread shape in functionalized peptide scaffoldsthan in pure RADA16-I scaffold. Finally, the 3-D reconstruc-tions clearly showed that the cells elongated to ﬁnd each otherto form cellular connections, which suggested that all these
three types of peptide scaffolds have provided suitable 3-D
environments for endothelial cells growth and differentiation.After 1-week culture, differentiated endothelial cells underwent

Fig. 7. In this study, both pure RADA16-I and functionalizedpeptide scaffolds could facilitate cells to form capillary-likestructures through cellular reorganization of one cell (Fig. 7,image a and b) or cellular connection of two or more cells (Fig. 7,image c). No signiﬁcant differences were observed among thesepeptide scaffolds, which indicated that all peptides scaffolds could
provide suitable environments for endothelial cell growth and
induce differentiation with addition of VEGF. Fig. 7 presentedthe typical examples of tubulogenesis in 3-D peptide scaffolds.3.6 Other implications
Increasing numbers of in vitro angiogenesis models have been
developed and reported in the literature after angiogenesis wasﬁrst observed in vitro in 1980.
42These angiogenesis models can
be roughly classiﬁed into 2-D and 3-D models. They have notonly signiﬁcantly increased our understanding of physiologicaland pathological angiogenesis processes, but also they have been
used to screen angiogenic and angiostatic molecules.
43The 2-D
models are simplistic and mainly designed for the role of ECM invascular morphogenesis, in vitro activity of angiostatic mole-
cules, and the ultra-structure of capillary-like structure.However, 2-D models lack the third dimension and thus theycannot truly reﬂect all steps of angiogenesis. The 3-D models aremore realistic and appropriate for studying sprouting angio-genesis, effects of cytokines, and other cell behavioralphenomena. In most 3-D systems, high concentrations ofangiogenic factors are required for cell survival and sproutingbecause cultured endothelial cells undergo apoptosis /C2428–72
hours after seeding.
In our current study, we mainly focus on angiogenesis
for tissue engineering and tissue regeneration, especially fordesigning and selecting ideal tissue-engineered scaffolds thatpromote endothelial cell long-term survival, proliferation,migration, differentiation, and capillary invasion. 2-D and 3-Dangiogenesis models are therefore both necessary for studyingthe different cellular responses of endothelial cells to the designerbiological materials. Although we have also studied endothelialcell morphogenesis, and lumen formation in 3-D designer func-tionalized peptide scaffolds, more systematic 3-D studies will be
further investigated in detail in subsequent study.
In addition to in vitro studies, full analysis of blood vessel
in-growth in engineered tissue substitutes in vivo is necessary for

4. Conclusion
We have developed and evaluated two new designer functional-
ized self-assembling peptide nanoﬁber scaffolds speciﬁcally for
angiogenesis study through directly coupling RADA16-I withshort biologically angiogenic motifs. In our study, these twodesigner functionalized peptides, KLT and PRG have beendemonstrated to signiﬁcantly enhance endothelial cell survival,rapid proliferation, migration, and morphological differentiationin vitro . These scaffolds will be likely very useful for tissue
engineering and diverse tissues regenerations.
