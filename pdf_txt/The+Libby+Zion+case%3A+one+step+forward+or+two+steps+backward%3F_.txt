Accreditation of Resident Education
Historically, review of residency programs has
been provided by the American Medical
Association (AMA), which provided listings of
‘‘approved’’ programs as early as 1910. The
Residency Review Committees (RRCs) that
accredit resident education in the individual
specialties emerged in the 1950s, with surgery
and internal medicine first forming committees in
1950.1Before 1974, the RRCs performed their
peer review and accreditation function
independently, with support and staffing from the
AMA.1In 1972, the Liaison Committee for
Graduate Medical Education (LCGME) was
inaugurated and began to provide a convening
function for the RRCs.1The ACGME was
organized in 1981 by transitioning the LCGME to
an unincorporated entity with 5 member
organizations (the AMA, the American Board of
Medical Specialties, the American Hospital
Association, the Association of American
Medical Colleges [AAMC], and the Council of
Medical Specialty Societies).1
Like the ACGME in later years, the LCGME
used documented accreditation standards
comprising general requirements that applied to
all accredited programs and specialty-specific
program requirements.2The early requirements
did not explicitly reference resident hours;
instead, they mentioned resident supervision
and the learning environment, requiring a ‘‘well
organized and well qualified teaching staff’’ and
‘‘an educational committee of the staff which is
responsible for the organization, supervision,
and direction of the residency program.’’3The
requirements further stated that ‘‘[t]he
educational effectiveness of a residency
depends largely on the quality of its supervision
and organization,’’ and that ‘‘[t]he responsi-
bilities for these important functions lie with the
department heads and a representative
committee of the medical staff.’’3As an educational accreditor, the ACGME
monitors compliance and cites programs that do
not meet its standards. It promotes resident
learning and patient safety by requiring an
educational curriculum; specifying the patient
care experiences important to competence for
independent practice; and ensuring that
programs track the progress of residents through
regular evaluations, including assessment of
their knowledge, clinical and procedural skills,
and competencies such as communication and
interpersonal skills. Programs that do not comply
with these standards are cited, and may be
placed on probation, and residents and
applicants must be notified that this has
occurred. As this negatively impacts the ability to
attract good residents, it is a powerful incentive
for compliance. The accreditation of programs
that fail to improve ultimately is withdrawn, after
a system of due process. The ACGME also
periodically (at minimum every 5 years)4updates
its accreditation standards and enforcement
processes to accommodate changes in the
practice of the medicine and in educational
theory and methodology, and other factors
affecting graduate medical education, such as
enhanced public calls for accountability.
The US Congress, the Department of Health
and Human Services, and the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid recognize that the
ACGME fosters high-quality education and safe
and effective patient care by requiring
accreditation of programs that receive graduate
medical education payments under the Medicare
program.5In addition, state medical licensing
authorities expect residents to complete 1 or
more years in an ACGME-accredited residency
program as a condition of physician licensure.6
Duty Hours: The EarlyYears
Long hours are a component of medical
residency and preparation for an occupation that
5requires hard work and dedication. Their origin,
along with the term ‘‘resident,’’ are found in
traditional models of physician education as
brief periods of intense training, during which
responsibility for patients rested with residents
24 hours a day, 7 days a week. By the latter part
of the 21st century, this had given way to a
multiyear experience that combined exposure to
patients with new learning modalities in a vastly
changed delivery system.
The formal study of the effect of residents’
long hours on performance began in 1971, when
a study showed postcall residents made more
errors in reading a standardized
electrocardiogram than their rested colleagues.7
Earlier research using military personnel and
college-age volunteers had shown that sleep
deprivation affected performance across a range
of dimensions including vigilance, cognition, and
executive function.8,9
As early as 1980–1981, the specialty-specific
Program Requirements for Internal Medicine and
Pediatrics included statements on a balance of
education and service demands, and the need
for time for educational and personal pursuits.10
The pediatrics standard stated that ‘‘[h]ospital
duties should not be so pressing or consuming
that they preclude ample time for other
important phases of the training program or for
personal needs.’’11Several specialties adopted
similar language throughout the 1980s.
Regulation of Resident Hours in
NewYork State
In 1984, the death of Libby Zion in a New York
teaching hospital initiated a debate about
resident hours and supervision.12Zion, a college
freshman, died within 8 hours of her emergency
admission to a major New York teaching hospital
where she had been cared for by first-year and
second-year residents. Initially, her death was
ascribed to an infection, but today most agree
she died from serotonin syndrome, prompted by
the closely timed administration of 2 psychiatric
drugs, meperidine and phenelzine.13,14Her
father, an influential newspaper columnist,
began a campaign that targeted the longresident hours and poor supervision he felt had
contributed to his daughter’s death.
A 1986 grand jury investigation found the
death was related to 36-hour duty periods
worked by the residents involved in her care and
to inadequate supervision by the attending
physicians.12,15Testimony provided to the grand
jury showed awareness of the complexity of duty
hour regulation: ‘‘It would be unrealistic to
expect residents to absorb the realities of caring
for their equally fragile and needy patients if their
working hours were fixed according to an
arbitrary schedule, however well-intended’’
(F. Davidoff, MD, testimony to the 1986 Ad Hoc
Committee charged with the inquiry into Libby
Zion’s death). The grand jury called for reforming
resident education, including regulation of
resident hours and supervision, and the New
York Health Commissioner appointed an
Advisory Committee, which became known as
the Bell Commission.15The Committee’s
findings were released in 1987 and included a
recommendation for an 80-hour limit on weekly
resident hours, a maximum of 24 consecutive
hours on duty, and a requirement for the
presence of senior physicians in the hospital.16,17
Despite controversy and resistance by the
teaching hospital community, the recommenda-
tions were incorporated into the New York State
Health Code in 1989, making New York the first
state to regulate resident hours.17The regulations,
incorporated into the state hospital code at section
405.4, which governed se rvice delivery by the
organized medical staff, encompassed the duty
hour limits and enhancements to supervision
recommended by the Bell Commission.18Adoption
was gradual and 10 years after the regulations had
been issued, site visits to assess compliance with
the regulations revealed widespread noncompli-
ance.18In 2002, site surveys by a contractor hired
by New York State to monitor compliance showed
that more than 60% of the 118 teaching hospital
surveyed were in violation of the limits.19Today
compliance is improved in part due to vigilant
monitoring by the State and the ACGME.
New York remains the only state that has
adopted regulatory standards for resident hours.The ACGME 2011 Duty Hour Standards
6Other states (California, Connecticut, Florida,
Iowa, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania)
considered and rejected adopting similar
regulation. The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico
instituted local regulation of duty hour limits in
2003, though it does not provide specific
enforcement mechanisms.20Adoption of the
New York duty hour regulation has been costly. A
1989 survey estimated that the regulation
produced additional staffing costs for New York
hospitals of more than $358 million.21An added
concern is that regulation did not appear to meet
the primary aim of making patient care safer or
better.22,23
TheACGME 1987 Task Force on Resident
Hours and Supervision
In response to interest in duty hour limits
prompted by the death of Libby Zion, in June
1987 the ACGME authorized the formation of a
Task Force on Resident Hours and Supervision
and charged it with studying 3 areas: the
adequacy of resident supervision; resident
schedules and number of hours of work; and the
changing educational sites for resident
education. The Task Force developed preliminary
recommendations for standards for review at the
February 1988 ACGME meeting.23The group also
affirmed the following: (1) education is the
primary objective of residency; (2) a relationship
exists between the quality of training and the
quality of medical care provided by physicians
after graduation; (3) residents play a role in
providing continuity of care; (4) attending
physicians have ultimate responsibility for care;
and (5) education and patient care benefit when
resident schedules maximize educational
experiences, while allowing for rest to avoid
stress, fatigue, and depression. In addition to
addressing resident hours, new standards defined
the clinical support services, including pathology,
radiology, results retrieval, and messenger and
transport services that would need to be available
to residents at all times, including evenings and
nights.24Specific recommendations included
(1) 1 day in 7 away from the hospital; (2) on-call
duty in the hospital no more frequently than everythird night; (3) adequate backup if sudden and
unexpected patient care needs create resident
fatigue sufficient to jeopardize patient care; and
(4) institutional policies to ensure that all
residents are adequately supervised and reliable
methods of communication between residents
and supervising physicians.24The Task Force also
recommended that each RRC develop standards
regarding the frequency of duty and on-call
assignments for residents.24
TheAAMC 1988 Position Statement
In March 1988, the AAMC released its position
on resident hours and supervision.25In keeping
with its role as an academic member
organization, the AAMC presented its position as
a set of guidelines for hospitals to consider and
use in a manner appropriate to their setting, role,
and resources.25The guidelines asked each
hospital to develop operational mechanisms to
ensure that resident education enhanced the
quality of care provided to patients.25
The AAMC guidelines specified that hours
should not exceed 80 per week, averaged over
4 weeks, and recommended curtailing
moonlighting by limiting the total hours of
residency and moonlighting to 80 hours per
week.25It called for changes in resident hours to
be phased in gradually to avoid compromising
patient care or the educational goals of
residency programs, and it recommended that all
payers reimburse teaching hospitals for the
incremental costs incurred as a result of these
changes.25
The 1992 Common ACGME Standards
In February 1988, the ACGME adopted the Task
Force’s report and assigned an ad hoc
committee to incorporate them into the general
requirements. The ACGME continued to debate
general duty hour standards for the next 2 years
and the revised general requirements were
accepted at the ACGME’s June 1990 meeting
and forwarded to the ACGME’s 5 member
organizations.26The 1990 version specified that
(1) at least one 24-hour day in 7 should be free
of patient care responsibilities and that (2) on-Enhancing Quality of Care, Supervision, and Resident Professional Development
7call in the hospital should be no more than every
third night, averaged over a 4-week period.
As the ACGME debated common standards,
several RRCs established specialty-specific
standards that set limits on weekly duty hours.
The RRC for Internal Medicine (RRC-IM)
instituted an 80-hour weekly limit, averaged over
4 weeks, to become effective in July 1989.27In
1990, 3 additional RRCs set limits on weekly
hours. The RRCs for Dermatology and
Ophthalmology established a weekly limit of
80 hours, averaged over 4 weeks,28,29and the
RRC for Emergency Medicine established a limit
of 72 hours, of which only 60 could be devoted to
clinical activity.30In the early 1990s, 2 additional
specialties set limits of 80 weekly hours,
averaged over 4 weeks. For allergy and
immunology, the standard became effective in
July 1992, and for preventive medicine, in July
1993.31,32By 1993, 6 specialties, including
internal medicine, the largest accredited specialty,
had established a weekly duty hour limit.
Because of the multilayered approval process
in operation before the ACGME became an
independent corporation in 2002, seven
additional sets of revisions were made to the
standards, with the 5 member organizations
opposing various sections of the draft.33The
revised draft for the general requirements
ultimately was approved in February 1992, with
an effective date of July 1, 1992.34Two of the 5
member organizations had withheld their
approval until revisions were made in the duty
hour language, and the revised requirements
asked that ‘‘each residency program establish
formal policies governing resident duty hours and
working environment that are optimal for both
resident education and the care of patients.’’33,34
The EarlyYears of the 21st Century
In 1999, the Institute of Medicine released ‘‘To
Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System.’’37
The report did not particularly implicate resident
physicians or their long hours; instead, it
recommended interventions to reduce the
potential for errors in health care, including
labeling and packaging strategies for high-riskdrugs and substances with similar names,
training issues for residents, work-rest cycles,
how relief and replacement processes could be
improved, and improvements to equipment (eg,
standardizing equipment in terms of the shape of
knobs and the direction in which they
turn).’’37(p64)Its release prompted the ACGME
Board of Directors and its Strategic Initiatives
Committee to explore sources of errors in the
resident education environment, with reviews of
the literature and other sources again
suggesting limitation of resident hours and
enhancing supervision as important strategies to
enhance safety in teaching settings.38
An added reason for a reassessment of the
duty hour standards was enhanced public focus
on resident hours, and the observation that the
specialty-focused and nuanced nature of the
ACGME’s approach to setting limits made it
difficult to explain the standards and their
benefits to patient safety to the public. A
commentary by the ACGME’s director noted,
‘‘patients have the right to expect competent
care in all phases of an acute illness, and
residents have a right to expect competent
supervision in all aspects of their education in
which they interface with patients.’’35(p1)
After approval of the new duty hour standards
in 1992, the RRCs had begun to monitor
compliance and to cite programs for
noncompliance. The ACGME did not make
summary compliance data public for nearly
10 years, and there was variability among the
RRCs in citing programs with violations on the
duty hour standards. In 2000, the ACGME first
published aggregated data on compliance with
the duty hour standards for the year 1999, and a
report released in 2001 compared duty hour
compliance for 1999 and 2000.35It contrasted
the percentage of programs and institutions
cited for violations in 1999 with data for the year
2000, showing that in 1999, 17 of 87
institutions (20%) sponsoring residency
education programs that were reviewed during
the year had failed to comply substantially with
the duty hour requirements. By 2000, that
number had fallen to 10 of 127 institutions (8%)The ACGME 2011 Duty Hour Standards
8reviewed. The percentage of internal medicine
programs cited for duty hours fell from 30% in
1999 to 10% in 2000, and the percentage of
orthopedic surgery programs cited declined from
29% to 10%. In contrast, the percentage of
surgery programs cited remained constant (36%
versus 35%).35
In 2001, citation rates for duty hour violations
were 18% for surgery programs (of 99 programs
reviewed), 21% for thoracic surgery programs (of
19 programs reviewed), 19% for internal
medicine (of 81 programs reviewed), 11% for
pediatrics (of 35 programs reviewed), 10% for
family medicine programs (of 136 programs
reviewed), and 5% for obstetrics and gynecology
programs (of 81 programs reviewed).36
Proposals for Federal Regulation of
Resident Hours
On April 30, 2001, a petition requested that the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration
regulate duty hours as a workplace health
hazard.39Federal legislation, called the Patient
and Physician and Protection Act (HR 3236), was
proposed in November 2001 by Representative
John Conyers of Michigan, which would limit
resident work hours and provide federal
enforcement.40Approximately 6 months later,
Senator John Corzine of New Jersey introduced
comparable legislation in the Senate (S 2614).41
Several major academic organizations issued
position statements on resident hours. In June
2001, the AMA Board of Trustees formally
affirmed it would (1) encourage the ACGME to
enforce its work-hour guidelines to the maximum
limit and develop mechanisms to assure that
noncompliance would be corrected quickly and
completely; (2) facilitate discussion on
legislative and other options to enforce work-
hour standards; and (3) investigate the
enforcement of the current duty hour
standards.42The AAMC issued a statement on
graduate medical education policy relevant to
duty hours and supervision that echoed many
elements of its 1988 duty hour position,
including that ‘‘prudence favors the
establishment of a reasonable upper limit,’’ andconcluded that ‘‘80 hours per week constituted
a reasonable limit, albeit a generous one by any
conventional standard.’’43The American College
of Surgeons issued a statement noting that
‘‘[i]mplicit in a residency program is the principle
that all patient care provided by residents is safe
and well supervised…quality patient care, now
and in the future, is dependent on quality
graduate education. It is critical to monitor,
modify, and optimize the work environment to
achieve this important goal.’’44
Formation of theACGME Work Group on Duty
Hours and the Learning Environment
In September 2001, the ACGME authorized the
formation of a Work Group on Resident Duty
Hours and the Learning Environment and
charged it with the development of enhanced
ACGME-wide general standards for resident duty
hours and with providing recommendations in a
number of related areas, such as enforcement
and educational activities.45,46The Work Group’s
report was scheduled for review in February
2002. The charge called for the Work Group to
develop a comprehensive approach that
considered the relationship between resident
hours and the elements of the learning and
working environment, building on the ACGME’s
role and success in fostering high-quality
education and patient and resident safety.47
The Work Group was asked to provide
recommendations for how the ACGME could
enhance its efforts related to duty hours,
minimize any negative impact on physician
learning, explore innovative approaches for
education under restricted hours, and
communicate the ACGME’s duty hour
standards, policies, and related efforts to
stakeholders, legislative and regulatory bodies,
and the public.
