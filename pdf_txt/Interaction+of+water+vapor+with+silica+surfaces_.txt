Abstract
A review article is presented of the research results obtained by the author on the properties of amorphous silica
surface. It has been shown that in any description of the surface silica the hydroxylation of the surface is of criticalimportance. An analysis was made of the processes of dehydration (the removal of physically adsorbed water),dehydroxylation (the removal of silanol groups from the silica surface), and rehydroxylation (the restoration of thehydroxyl covering). For each of these processes a probable mechanism is suggested. The results of experimental andtheoretical studies permitted to construct the original model (Zhuravlev model-1 and model-2) for describing thesurface chemistry of amorphous silica. The main advantage of this physico-chemical model lies in the possibility todetermine the concentration and the distribution of different types of silanol and siloxane groups and to characterizethe energetic heterogeneity of the silica surface as a function of the pretreatment temperature of SiO
2samples. The
model makes it possible to determine the kind of the chemisorption of water (rapid, weakly activated or slow, stronglyactivated) under the restoration of the hydroxyl covering and also to assess of OH groups inside the SiO
2skeleton.
The magnitude of the silanol number, that is, the number of OH groups per unit surface area, aOH, when the surface
is hydroxylated to the maximum degree, is considered to be a physico-chemical constant. This constant has anumerical value: a
OH,AVER 4.6 (least-squares method) and aOH,AVER 4.9 OH nm2(arithmetical mean) and is
known in literature as the Kiselev–Zhuravlev constant. It has been established that adsorption and other surfaceproperties per unit surface area of silica are identical (except for very ﬁne pores). On the basis of data published inthe literature, this model has been found to be useful in solving various applied and theoretical problems in the ﬁeldof adsorption, catalysis, chromatography, chemical modiﬁcation, etc. It has been shown that the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method is the correct method and gives the opportunity to measure the real physical magnitude of thespeciﬁc surface area, S
Kr(by using low temperature adsorption of krypton), for silicas and other oxide dispersed
solids. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Research into the silica-water system is impor-
tant both for elucidating the theoretical aspects ofthe problems involved and for practical applica-
tions [1]. In this connection an investigation of theso-called combined, structurally bound water [2–5] in dispersed amorphous silica is of interest.

This term describes OH groups that are bound via
the valence bond with Si atoms on the silicasurface (hydroxyl coverage), and in some caseswith Si atoms inside the particles of silica.
In the 1930s, studies of the condensation pro-
cesses of silicic acids, carried out by Hofmann,Endell and Wilm [6], Rideal [7] and Kiselev [8],and slightly later by Carman [9], showed thathydroxyl (silanol) groups, /p13SiOH, should be
present on the surface of silicates and silicas. Onthe basis of measurements of the heat of wettingand a comparison of the adsorption data with thedata from chemical analysis and the correspond-ing results reported in the literature, Kiselev sug-gested that the water evolved during calcinationof silica gel, besides physically adsorbed water, isformed from OH groups that are chemically heldon the silica surface. This suggestion led to anunderstanding of the dehydroxylation mechanism[8].
Yaroslavsky and Terenin [11–13], by using an
infrared spectroscopy method, proved for the ﬁrsttime the existence of hydroxyl groups on the silicasurface (porous glass). This fact was soon conﬁ-rmed by Kurbatov and Neuymin [14]. Now nu-merous spectral and chemical dataunambiguously conﬁrm the presence of the OHgroups on such SiO
2surface.Silanol groups are formed on the surface by two
main processes [1,36]. First, such groups areformed in the course of silica synthesis, e.g. duringthe condensation polymerization of Si(OH)
4(Fig.
1a). Here, the supersaturated solution of the acidbecomes converted into its polymeric form, whichthen changes into spherical colloidal particles con-taining/p13SiOH groups on the surface. Upon
drying, the hydrogel yields xerogel, the ﬁnalproduct, which retains some or all of the silanolgroups on its surface. Secondly, surface OHgroups can form as a result of rehydroxylation ofdehydroxylated silica when it is treated with wateror aqueous solutions. The surface silicon atomstend to have a complete tetrahedral conﬁguration,and in an aqueous medium their free valencebecomes saturated with hydroxyl groups (Fig. 1b).
The surface properties of amorphous silica,
which is considered to be an oxide adsorbent, inmany cases depend on the presence of silanolgroups. At a sufﬁcient concentration these groupsmake such a surface hydrophilic. The OH groupsact as the centers of molecular adsorption duringtheir speciﬁc interaction with adsorbates capableof forming a hydrogen bond with the OH groups,or, more generally, of undergoing donor–acceptorinteraction. The removal of the hydroxyl groupsfrom the surface of silica leads to a de-

of bridging bonds ( OSi) tied to the central Si atom: Q4,
surface siloxanes; Q3, single silanols; Q2, geminal silanols
(silanediols).Various problems related to silica surface char-
acteristics are encountered in different areas ofscience and technology: physics, chemistry andphysical chemistry, agriculture, soil science, biol-ogy and medicine, electrical energetics, the oilprocessing industry, the metallurgical and miningindustries, some ﬁelds of geology, etc. Traditionalbuilding and other materials based on silica, suchas cement, concrete, ﬁrebrick, silicate glasses,rough and ﬁne ceramics, and enamels, occupy asigniﬁcant place in human life. Different types ofsilica are widely used as efﬁcient adsorbents andselective absorbents, active phase carriers in catal-ysis, ﬁllers for polymeric systems, adsorbents andsupports for gas and liquid chromatography,thickeners for dispersion mediums, binding agentsfor molding materials, reinforcing ﬁbres, and soforth. Chemical modiﬁcation of the surface ofdispersion silica has received a large amount ofinterest; this process allows researchers to regulateand change adsorption properties and technologi-cal characteristics of composite materials. Of latethe use of SiO
2is on the rise in the manufacture
of modern high-quality materials (microelectron-ics, optics, ﬁber optics, liquid crystals, differentcomposites including biocomposites, orderednanostructured silica materials, monodispersedcolloids, etc.).
In the past 50 years, many reviews have ap-
peared on the subject of surface chemistry ofsilica. And we refer readers to these numerousmonographs, reviews, and the most interestingand signiﬁcant, in our opinion, articles [1,11–300].
In view of this, is there need for yet another
review in this ﬁeld? The author of the presentreview article has carried out numerous experi-mental studies on the subject in question, system-ized such important characteristics as theconcentration and the distribution of differenttypes of silanol groups, established the energeticheterogeneity of the surface in a wide temperaturerange of the pretreatment, and investigated thecharacteristics of bound water inside SiO
2parti-
cles. Besides, it was made careful study of thestructure characteristics of many different silicasamples. On the basis of these researches theauthor was able to construct an original physico-crease in the adsorption, and the surface acquires
more and more hydrophobic properties [1,36].
Surface OH groups are subdivided as following
(Fig. 2): (i) isolated free (single silanols), /p13SiOH;
(ii) geminal free (geminal silanols or silanediols),Si(OH)
2; (iii) vicinal, or bridged, or OH groups
bound through the hydrogen bond (H-bondedsingle silanols, H-bonded geminals, and their H-bonded combinations). On the SiO
2surface there
also exist surface siloxane groups or /p13SiOSi/p13
bridges with oxygen atoms on the surface. At last,there is structurally bound water inside the silicaskeleton and very ﬁne ultramicropores, dB1n m
(dis the pore diameter), i.e. internal silanol
groups.
The last number of decades saw a rapid growth
in those ﬁelds of science and technology that dealwith production and utilization of various colloidand microheterogeneous forms of silica with de-veloped surfaces, such as sols, gels, and powders.The properties of a pure silica, as an oxide adsor-bent, are determined in the ﬁrst place by: (i) thechemical activity of the surface — this activitydepends on the concentration and the distributionof different types of OH groups, and on thepresence of siloxane bridges; and (ii) the porousstructure of the silica.L.T.Zhura6le6:Colloids and Surfaces A :Physicochem .Eng.Aspects 173 (2000) 1–38 4
chemical model [301–303], describing the surface
properties of amorphous silica (referred in litera-ture as the Zhuravlev model). Therefore, it wouldbe pertinent to compare in this review article theresults obtained by the author with those reportedin literature.
In this model for the amorphous silica surface
the determining factor is the presence of silanolgroups and siloxane bridges. The concentration ofthese groups depends on the conditions of thermaltreatment of the SiO
2sample in vacuo (or on
other types of pretreatment). It is necessary totake into account possible changes occurringsimultaneously in the degree of surface coveragewith adsorbed water molecules or with differentsurface groups and in the energetics of dehydra-tion (the removal of physically adsorbed water),dehydroxylation (the removal of silanol groups)and rehydroxylation (the restoration of the hy-droxylated covering) processes. Also it ought tofollow some changes in structure of the surfaceand the skeleton of the silica matrix. These factorsdetermine the starting conditions that are neces-sary for working out the model for the amor-phous silica surface. To avoid the introduction ofsuch complicating factors as the possible effect onthe silica surface properties of any impurities,structural defects, other functional groups andactive sites, etc. they are not considered at thisstage.
2. Experimental section
The versions of the method of deuterium ex-
change (DE method) developed by the author[304–306,311,312,321,322,328] have been used fordetermining the concentration of the hydroxylgroups on the surface of dispersed oxide adsor-bents. The advantage of this method is that, un-der certain conditions, deuterium exchange islimited to the surface and does not involve struc-turally bound water inside silica. According tothis DE method an isotopic exchange takes placebetween a known quantity of heavy water D
2O
and an unknown number of hydroxyl groups onthe surface of the sample. The concentration ofthe original OH groups or the silanol number,that is, the number of OH groups per unit surface
area, a
OH(OH nm2), is determined from the
known ratio of the concentrations of the isotopes,[H]:[D], in the water vapor phase, after comple-
tion of the deuterium exchange, and from theknown weight of the sample and its speciﬁc sur-face area:

concentration of OH groups on the surface ofSiO

m,Kr0.215 nm2) [50]; NA, the
Avogadro number; and K602.214 is constant.
The determination of the isotopic composition
of water vapor following the DE reaction wascarried out by using mass spectrum measurementsand other methods of the isotopic analysis. One ofthe variants of this DE method [311,322] made itpossible to determine the silanol number andsimultaneously to study the kinetics of water ad-sorption and isotopic exchange between D
2O and
the surface OH groups. The minimal measuredamount of water on the SiO
2surface formed from
2·1 04to2·1 06moles H2O with a rela-
tive error of91–5% (the different versions).
The DE method has some drawback: it cannot
be used for determining separately the molecu-larly adsorbed water and different kinds of silanolgroups. For such a determination we used themass spectrometric thermal analysis in conjunc-tion with the temperature-programmed desorp-tion (the MTA-TPD method), the infraredspectroscopic method, and some others.
The process of the removal of physically ad-
sorbed water and hydroxyl groups from the sur-face of the silica sample has been investigatedusing the MTA-TPD method. In general, theversions of the MTA-TPD method, worked outby the author [302,303,332], make it possible toobtain the following: thermal desorption curvesL.T.Zhura6le6:Colloids and Surfaces A :Physicochem .Eng.Aspects 173 (2000) 1–38 5
(or mass thermograms); the spectra of volatile
components under the condition of linear heatingof the sample (in the temperature range 25–1000°C); the energy of activation of thermal des-orption; and other kinetic parameters. The kineticparameters have been estimated by known meth-ods [341–346]. A characteristic feature of theMTA-TPD method is a high sensitivity due to thedesign of a pyrolysis chamber. An open-type mi-crocrucible for holding the SiO
2sample is simulta-
neously as a thermojoint of the thermocouple andlocates near the ion source of the mass spectrome-ter. The weight of the SiO
2sample was less than
10 mg. The precision of determining of the sampletemperature at any given moment of time andthroughout the entire temperature range was 9
1.5°C.
In our work we used pure amorphous silica
samples of different origins: silica gels, aerosils(pyrogenic silicas), aerosilogels and porousglasses. In all about 150 samples were investi-gated; for 100 of these determinations were madeof the silanol number when the surface was hy-droxylated to the maximum degree [301–303]. Alarge number of different samples had to be usedin order to obtain a reliable physico-chemicalconstant (see below).
The following varieties (a–i) of amorphous sil-
ica were investigated (Table 5):
a. laboratory-made and industrial silica gels syn-
thesized by the acidic method (26 samples);
b. laboratory-made silica gels obtained by the
acidic method with the use of hydrothermaltreatment at the hydrogel or xerogel stage(nine samples);
c. laboratory-made silica gel obtained by hydrol-
ysis of tetraethoxysilane (one sample);
d. laboratory-made and industrial silica gels ob-
tained by the Bard ion exchange method [339]from alkali and acid sols (14 samples);
e. laboratory-made aerosilogels obtained from an
aqueous suspension of aerosils (20 samples);
f. laboratory-made porous glasses obtained by
leaching sodium borosilicate glass (tensamples);
g. rehydroxylated industrial silica gels (12
samples);h. rehydroxylated laboratory-made and indus-
trial aerosilogels (ﬁve samples);
i. rehydroxylated laboratory-made porous
glasses (three samples).
The skeleton structure of the silica samples was ofa globular- [1,36] or sponge-form [320]. The sam-ples differed strongly in the following characteris-tics: speciﬁc surface area, types of pore,distribution of pores according to their size, andthe density of packing of the particles. The studyof such structures proved to be an importantstage in our work [301–303,305–311,317–320,323–327]. To determine the structure of dif-ferent samples, besides the adsorption of Kr andN
2, we measured the total isotherms of adsorption
and desorption — including capillary condensa-tion, of water vapor, methanol and benzene, weused the method of apparent density, the mer-cury-porosimetric method, and the electron-mi-croscopic and the kinetic methods. The silicasamples had speciﬁc surface areas S
Krvarying
from 9.5 to 945 m2g1[301–303].
When measuring aOHone of the most impor-
tant factor is the speciﬁc surface area, SKr,a s
determined by BET method based on low temper-ature adsorption of krypton [50]. This inert sub-stance Kr was chosen because the adsorption ofkrypton on the silica surface as determined by thedispersion interaction is non-speciﬁc in nature, i.e.it is insensitive to changes in the degree of hydrox-ylation of the sample. Thus, the silanol numbera
OHwas determined on the surface of the pores,
which were accessible to Kr atoms. According tothe classiﬁcation (IUPAC) by Dubinin [340] suchpores include: macropores, d\200–400 nm;
mesopores, 3.0–3.2 nm BdB200–400 nm; and
supermicropores, 1.2–1.4 nm BdB3.0–3.2 nm ( d
is the pore diameter). In those cases where thebiporous SiO
2samples contained very narrow
pores (ultramicropores, dB1 nm) together with
wide pores (mesopores), the samples were consid-ered to be wide-pores ones, and the very narrowpores were excluded from consideration when de-termining a
OH. The diameter of ultramicropores is
comparable with that of water molecules, andtherefore only water molecules can penetratethem. The OH groups in these very narrow poreswere classiﬁed not as surface silanol groups but asbound water inside the silica particles.L.T.Zhura6le6:Colloids and Surfaces A :Physicochem .Eng.Aspects 173 (2000) 1–38 6
Determinations were made of the structural
characteristics of the silica samples both beforethermal treatment and after treatment at tempera-tures from 180–200 up to 1000–1100°C.
To study surface dehydration and dehydroxyla-
tion of amorphous silica by the MTA-TPDmethod, without side undesirable effects, it wasnecessary to prepare a standard SiO
2sample. This
sample had to meet the following requirements:
1. the surface of the starting sample should be
completely hydroxylated;
2. the diameter of the pores should be much
greater than the size of the water molecule sothat the effects of diffusive retardation and thereadsorption inside pores are suppressed to amaximum extent;
3. there should be no structurally bound water
inside the silica skeleton so that the side effectdue to the evolution of water from the bulk ofthe sample at higher temperatures was absentat all;
4. the silica sample should be free of extraneous
impurities on its surface and inside it; and
5. the structure of the SiO
2skeleton should be
stabilized.
The method of synthesizing such the standard
sample has been reported [302,303,332]. It wasfound that the most suitable type of SiO
2which
meets the above-mentioned requirements was anaerosilogel, amorphous silica containing uni-formly wide pores (mesopores) [142]. It was pre-pared from an aqueous suspension of very purepyrogenic silica (aerosil, S180 m
2g1). The
stabilized structure of the silica skeleton was ob-tained by multiple heating (in the atmosphere orin the water vapor) at temperatures up to 940°Cwith following cooling of the sample each time.The distribution of the pores in terms of theirdiameter, d, lay within a narrow range with a
maximum at 51 nm. The speciﬁc surface area ofthe sample was S 79 m
2g1as determined by
the BET method from the low temperature ad-sorption of Kr, and this standard sample wasnamed ‘S-79’.
The comparison of the results obtained by the
author [301–303,332,334–338] with those re-ported in literature covers the following topics: (i)limiting temperature for removing physically ad-sorbed water from the hydroxylated surface of
amorphous silica; (ii) completely hydroxylatedstate of the surface; (iii) structurally bound waterinside the particles of amorphous silica; (iv) dehy-droxylation and rehydroxylation of the silica sur-face; (v) energetic heterogeneity of the surface;and (vi) physico-chemical model of amorphoussilica surface: main stages and distribution ofvarious types of surface groups.
3. Results and discussion
3.1.Boundary temperature for remo 6ing
physically adsorbed water from the hydroxylatedsurface of amorphous silica
To elucidate the nature of hydroxyl coverage
and to quantitatively determine the concentrationof OH groups on the silica surface it is necessaryto distinguish these groups from the molecularlyadsorbed water. Although many investigationshave been carried out by different researchersusing various methods for determining the valueof the boundary temperature, T
B, for removing
the physically adsorbed water, there is no agree-ment between the values obtained so far. Thefollowing examples of the results reported in liter-ature show a wide discrepancy of T
Bvalues.
Iler, after reviewing numerous reported results,
concluded in his monograph [1], that on silicadried from water, the hydrogen-bounded watermolecules came off at room temperature in vac-uum or at 150°C in the atmosphere. The prevail-ing view is that drying in vacuum at lowtemperatures is the only way to remove the ad-sorbed water without disturbing the OH groups.Also, this is the conclusion reached by Gregg andSing in their monograph [158].
De Boer et al. [37–39] found that silica dried in
air at 120°C loses all physically adsorbed waterbut at 110°C still retains water if the air is humid.According to Okkerse [104] the removal of allphysically adsorbed water at 120°C is possibleonly if the silica sample is free of micropores.When silica contains micropores the adsorbedwater can be retained in the micropores at tem-peratures up to 180°C even though the surface ofL.T.Zhura6le6:Colloids and Surfaces A :Physicochem .Eng.Aspects 173 (2000) 1–38 7
wide pores begins to be free of OH groups.
Bermudez [106] in his investigations using theNMR method has established that after exposuref o r6ha t 110°C all water is removed from the
silica surface including some silanol groups, aswell as some internal water. Taylor, Hockey et al.used 115°C during subjecting silica to pretreat-ment either in air or in vacuum [73,82].
Young and Bursh investigated the interaction
of water vapor with the surface of amorphoussilica using different methods (thermal analysis,heat of immersion in water and others) [41,51].On the basis of these results the authors con-cluded that the dexydroxylation of surface OHgroups begins at 180°C.
The removal of physically adsorbed water from
the silica surface has been studied by many re-searches using thermogravimetric, thermodesorp-tion and other thermographic methods. As anexample, in Fig. 3 is presented the TGA (ther-mogravimetric analysis) thermogram of a silicasample, obtained by Vansant, Van Der Voort and
Vrancken [263]. This thermogram distinctly showsa sharp DTG (differential thermogravimetricanalysis) peak, attributed to the loss of physicallyadsorbed water from the surface of the poroussample. The proﬁles of curves 1 and 2 (DTG andTGA, respectively) indicate that desorption ofsuch physisorbed water is completed at 150°C
and is followed by a broad region of weight loss,due to dehydroxylation process.
It is necessary to note, that in numerous ther-
mographic investigations, fulﬁlled by different au-thors, an endothermic effect, i.e. a rather sharpDTA peak, in the range about 120–200°C is alsodirectly related to the removal of physically ad-sorbed water from the SiO
2surface.
A number of researchers gave the limiting tem-
perature TB\200°C. Thus, Baverez and Bastick
[66] on the basis of IR spectroscopic analysisfound that T
B$240°C. Fripiat and Uytterhoeven,
using the same method, came to the conclusion[58] that physically adsorbed water is completelyremoved only at 300°C.
Some Russian and Ukrainian researchers sug-
gested a concept according to a part of Si atomson the silica surface are coordinately unsaturated(so-called nonhydroxyl centers of the II-type).Thus, Kiselev et al. [83,102] assumed that thesewater molecules are completely removed in vac-uum only at400°C. Chuiko et al. [150,188]
considered that the adsorbed water molecule (withthe coordinate bound) near the II-type site can belocated either over the face of the silicon–oxygentetrahedron (Scheme 1(a)) or under the Si atom ofthe silanol group (Scheme 1(b)). The centers ofthe II-type ensure a strong retention of the coor-dinately bound water molecules on the SiO
2sur-
face up to650°C, with the energy of the
interaction of one H2O molecule with such a
center being up to 62 kcal mol1(260 kJ
mol1) [150].
It could be continued an enumeration of simi-
lar examples, because many data are given inliterature that show a broad scatter of T
Bvalues.
In order to ﬁnd the limiting temperature,
TB, we have carried out a series of investigat-
ions by employing the DE and MTA-TPDmethods together with some others [301–Fig. 3. Thermogravimetric analysis of a hydroxylated silica

Aseries of curves representing the reduced massthermograms of water obtained at the same rateof linear heating ( b5.8 grad min

in Fig. 5. The intensity, I, of the spectral peak of
water, m:Z18 (as determined according to the
ordinate axis), characterizes the rate of formationor the rate of thermal desorption of water. Priorto measurements by the MTA-TPD method thesesamples S-79 were subjected to treatment in vac-uum under different conditions of heating (Table1). It is necessary to note that a mass spectralanalysis of the escaping volatile products duringthe heating (25–1000°C) of the standard silicasample S-79 has shown that water is practicallythe only substance to be identiﬁed.
An examination of the ascending branches of
curves 1–7 and curve 8 up to the maximum (pointA in Fig. 5) shows the following.

(iI, II, III,…VIII); curves 8 and 14 are boundary curves (see
Table 1 and text).303,306,311,329,332]. In our complex thermo-
graphic investigations of several different silicasamples, we have detected endothermic peak at150°C on a DTA curve [329], and this effect, as
it noted before, is related to the removal of phys-ically (molecularly) adsorbed water.
Using a method which combines thermogravi-
metric measurements, deuterium exchange, andmass spectral analysis, we have investigated [306]large-pore silica gel ( S320 m
2g1). In Fig. 4
are shown the total loss of water, i.e. the loss ofphysically adsorbed water, hydroxyl coverage,and structural water inside globules of the SiO
2
sample, as a function of temperature, or the TGAcurve 1. The rate of the water loss (for each 1°Cincrease in temperature) is shown in the DTGcurve 2. From the shape of curves 1 and 2, it canbe seen that under step-wise heating conditions ina vacuum from room temperature to 150–200°Cthere came off mainly physically adsorbed water.At higher temperatures, there was desorption ofthe surface OH groups and the removal of struc-tural water from the bulk of the SiO
2sample also.
We have carried out studies of dehydration and
dehydroxylation using the silica standard sampleL.T.Zhura6le6:Colloids and Surfaces A :Physicochem .Eng.Aspects 173 (2000) 1–38 9

Curve 1 reﬂects the behavior of the ther-
mogram for an SiO2sample introduced into a
pyrolyzer as a suspension with a large excess ofliquid water. The experiment was carried out at atemperature range starting from 196°C (the
sample was in a frozen state) and up to 1000°C.As can be seen, a very intense maximum appearsin the range of 270–350 K. This effect is directlyrelated to the evaporation of the excess of waterin the liquid phase (free water — yellow colour inFig. 5), which was in suspension, and is notrelated to the desorption of water. Upon furtherheating, thermogram 1 passes through a secondmaximum, which is weaker but clearly deﬁned, atthe characteristic point A.
Curves 2, 3 and 4 (ascending regions) corre-
spond to samples which have been ﬁrst subjectedto treatment in vacuo at room temperature for 66,87 and 306 h, respectively; curves 5, 6, 7 and 9correspond to samples treated at 107, 136, 169and 203°C, respectively. Curve 8 (as well as curve14, which is considered below) was not registeredexperimentally; it was constructed by interpola-
tion with account taken of the behavior of theascending regions of the neighboring ther-mograms 7 and 9. An important conclusion canbe drawn from the experiments: the maxima of allthe kinetic curves 1–7 occurred at the same tem-perature T
A(600 K, point A in Fig. 5 and Table
1). It should be noted that for curves 1–7 thetemperature of the prelimenary treatment of thecorresponding samples of S-79 did not exceed200°C. When the temperature of pretreatmentwas above 200°C, the maxima of the correspond-ing thermograms were shifted into the region oftemperatures greater than T
A(to the right of
point A). Such a shift was the greater, the higherthe temperature of the preliminary treatment ofSiO
2(curves 9–17, Fig. 5 and Table 1). Curve 8
lies at the boundary since it is the last (on theright) which still passes through the stationarypoint A.
An analysis of region I to the left of the
boundary curve 8 shows that the region representsL.T.Zhura6le6:Colloids and Surfaces A :Physicochem .Eng.Aspects 173 (2000) 1–38 10
numerous ascending branches of the mass ther-
mograms each of which passes through a com-mon point A. It is reasonable to assume thatregion I corresponds to the state when, in addi-tion to the surface coverage consisting of hy-droxyl groups, the surface contains physicallyadsorbed water. The removal of such water(molecularly adsorbed water within the limits ofmultilayers and a monolayer, curves 1–8) at dif-ferent initial degrees of coverage has no any ef-fect on the position of the maximum (point A).This means that there coexist simultaneouslytwo independent types of bound water on theSiO
2surface: physically adsorbed water (region I
to the left of the boundary curve 8 — light blueand dark blue colours) and chemisorbed wateror hydroxyl coverage (region II to the right ofthe boundary curve 8 — red and crimsoncolours). Any change in the state of molecularlyadsorbed water (which depends on the condi-tions of pretreatment of the S-79 sample invacuo at temperatures B200°C, Table 1) in no
way affects the hydroxyl coverage. Thus, thecharacteristic point A (at T
A600 K), which
corresponds to the maximal rate of thermal des-orption of water from the SiO
2surface, is an
indicator of the dehydroxylation process but notof the dehydration process.
In order to determine the kinetic parameters
characteristic of dehydration (region I, Fig. 5)we resorted to graphic construction of the sub-
tractive differential thermokinetic curves, whichwere then processed according to a known pro-cedure [332,342,343]. The results, which aresummarized in Table 2, show that the activationenergy of desorption E
Dincreases from 6 to 10
kcal mol1(26–44 kJ mol1) as the extent of
the silica surface covered with physically ad-sorbed water decreases to u
H2O:0. Data in
column 2 of Table 2 show that the experimen-tally determined kinetic order of the thermaldesorption reaction nis close to unity. This
conﬁrms that the water adsorbed on the surface,which is in a molecular form, is removed inregion I (Figs. 11 and 12, see below).
On the basis of the ratios between the areas
belonging to regions I and II we can concludethat under the experimental conditions employedthe amount of physically adsorbed water (forsamples, which were pretreated at temperaturesmore 25°C, Table 1), i.e. the area limited byascending curves 4 and 8 (dark blue colour, Fig.5), is less than a single monolayer of water onthe silica surface.
Thus, the main mass of adsorbed water, in-
cluding the region corresponding to polymolecu-lar adsorption (between curves 1 and 4 — lightblue colour), is removed in vacuum at roomtemperature. However, a small amount of physi-cally adsorbed water, within the limits of amonolayer (between curves 4 and 8), remains onthe hydroxylated surface of silica up to approxi-mately 200°C.
The increase in the values of E
Dwith a decrease
in the degree of surface coverage by adsorbedwater in region I (Table 2 and Fig. 12, see below)is close to the observed changes in the values ofpure differential heat of adsorption of water va-por ( Q
A–L) (where QAis the differential heat of
adsorption, and L is the heat of condensation) ata low degree of coverage by adsorbed water onthe surface of silica, as shown by Dzhigit et al.[55]. As may be expected, the approximate equal-ity between E

On the basis of the shape of thethermograms of the subregions in region I,one can probably speak of the presence oftwo types of physically adsorbed water at alow degree of coverage. This accords with ourdata obtained by the method of molecular dy-namics [303,330,333] (Fig. 18, see below). Theactivation energy of desorption of the two typesof adsorbed water (within the limits of a mono-layer) lies approximately in the range E
D6–8
and 8–10 kcal mol1(Table 2, Fig. 12, see be-
low).
Now we shall determine the exact value of the
limiting temperature, TB, which separates these
two processes: dehydration and dehydroxylation.
Let us consider the ascending sectors in
boundary thermogram 8 and in the neighboringthermogram 9 (Figs. 5 and 10, see below). Inorder to determine the activation energy E
Din
the neighborhood of point A we used the non-isothermal method [341,346]. Experimentally ob-tained data on the position of point A fordifferent rates of linear heating of the sampleare summarized in Table 3. The graphic repre-sentation of the linear dependence of the differ-ence (2·log T
Alogb) as a function of the
reciprocal of the maximum temperature 1 :TA
yields 16.5 kcal mol1for the activation energy
ED.
To determine the reaction order n(for a given
ED), we used the method suggested by
Smolyaninov et al. [344]. The reaction order forcurve 8 was found to be n2.00 (Table 4). The
kinetic parameters for thermograms 8 and 9 ob-tained by known methods [344–346] are alsoshown in Table 4.
An interpolation based on the data for ther-
mograms 7 and 9 (Fig. 5) yields the temperatureof the preliminary treatment of SiO
2in the case
where the ascending branch of the kinetic curvemust exactly follow the boundary thermogram8. The threshold temperature corresponding tothe completion of dehydration and the begin-ning of dehydroxylation was found to be T

adsorption depends only on the rate at whichthe water molecules approach the surface ofporous SiO
2sample.
Mass thermograms 2–4 (ascending regions,
Fig. 5, and Table 1) relate to samples whichhave undergone preliminary treatment in vacuoat room temperature, followed by increasinglyprolonged periods of treatment. It can be seenthat for the subregion between curves 2 and 5the slope of the ascending sections of the ther-mograms decreases and there is a weak maxi-mum (curves 3 and 4) at approximately400–420 K. For the next subregion betweencurves 5 and 8, with an increase in the tempera-ture of preliminary treatment from about 100 to200°C (Table 1), the ascending sections becomeL.T.Zhura6le6:Colloids and Surfaces A :Physicochem .Eng.Aspects 173 (2000) 1–38 12
Thus, it was established that at TB(for amor-
phous silica subjected to pretreatment in vacuo at190°C) sharp changes of the parameters takeplace. These changes correspond to the change inthe activation energy of desorption E
Dapproxi-
mately from 10 to 17 kcal mol1(and thus to
changes in a number of other thermodynamicfunctions), and to the change in the kinetic orderof the limiting stage of thermal desorption nfrom
1 to 2 (Tables 2 and 4, Figs. 11 and 12, seebelow).

A critical comparison of various data in litera-
ture regarding the threshold temperature at whichthe physically adsorbed water comes off from thehydroxylated surface of amorphous silica revealsthe following. The value of T
B190°C practically
coincides with TB180°C obtained earlier by
Young and Bursh [41,51]. In our opinion thisvalue of T
B190910°C holds true for various
amorphous silica samples having different struc-tural characteristics.
3.2.Completely hydroxylated state of the silica
surface .Structurally bound water inside the
particles of amorphous silica
To develop a model describing the silica surface
it is necessary ﬁrst of all to have reliable quantita-tive data on the concentration of OH groups as afunction of the preliminary thermal treatment invacuum of SiO
2samples. This is particularly im-
portant for the initial fully hydroxylated state ofthe silica surface.
At the same time it is well known that different
types of amorphous dispersed silica contain notonly OH groups on the surface, but also struc-turally bound water within the silica skeleton andinside the ultramicropores of the sample. It isnecessary to make a distinction between internalwater, which has no effect on the surface pro-cesses, and the hydroxyl coverage. The latter de-termines all variety of interactions of differentsubstances with the active OH sites on the SiO
2
surface.
Let us consider the results obtained by the
author, using the DE method [301–303]. In Table5 are summarized values S,d
OH(S)and aOHdOH(S):S
that were obtained for 100 different samples ofamorphous silica (the varieties ‘a–i’, see above).Each numerical value of d
OH(S)and, respectively,
aOHis an average of two or more measurements
(altogether 231 measurements were carried out).The surface of these samples was subjected to themaximum degree of hydroxylation, i.e. the hy-drated samples were thermally pretreated in vacuoat 180–200°C (see above T
B190910°C).
In those cases where the biporous samples of
SiO2contained very narrow pores (ultramicropo-
res, dB1 nm) in addition to wide pores (meso-
pores) [307,311,318–320,331], the samples wereconsidered only to be wide-pore ones, and thevery narrow pores were excluded from consider-ation in determining a
OH(see above).
At ﬁrst, it would be pertinent to examine the
value for the concentration of OH groups on thesurface of SiO
2per unit mass of the sample, dOH(S),
as a function of S(Fig. 6). It can be seen that the
experimental values dOH(S)are bounded by two
slightly diverging straight (broken) lines passingthrough the origin of coordinates. There is a highvalue of the correlation coefﬁcient of the linearregression equation between d
OH(S)and S,r0.99,

a part of the total content of OH groups dOHin
silica; the other part of OH groups, dOH(V)dOH
dOH(S), is contained within the bulk. According to
our IR spectral measurements (together withDavydov and Kiselev) the latter consists of silanolgroups inside the silica sample (the absorptionband of stretching vibrations is about 3650 cm

[309]. The distribution of OH groups between thesurface and the volume of the sample depends ona number of factors, but mainly on the method ofpreparation of the silica sample and its subse-quent treatment.

the number of OH groups), for one arbitrary SiO2

between the upper hyperbola B and the lowerstraight line A and represented the total contentof OH groups (Fig. 8(a) and (b), black triangleswithin a green zone and a red band).
Thus the region of experimental points between
the boundary curves A and B (Fig. 8(a)) shouldbe considered to be the region of internal struc-turally water, i.e. of internal hydroxyl groups.Therefore, the experimental data reported in theliterature, which are usually based on the loss ofmass during calcination of the sample at hightemperatures, describe the total concentration ofOH groups in the sample, both within the bulkand on the surface (the ordinate of the pointsexceeds or equals k

to be expected that with a decrease in S, i.e. withL.T.Zhura6le6:Colloids and Surfaces A :Physicochem .Eng.Aspects 173 (2000) 1–38 16

an increase in the size of the silica particles, the
relative concentration of internal structurallybound water for freshly prepared samples canincrease. This explains the shape of curve B forthe maximum-hydroxylated sample. The con-stancy of k
2aOH, which is independent of S,
shows that the silanol number for the maximum-hydroxylated state of surface is represented by areproducible physico-chemical constant (Figs. 7and 8(a) and (b)).
Next we shall examine the data reported in
literature on the theoretical and crystallochemicalestimates of the concentration of OH groups fordifferent types of silica hydroxylated to a maxi-mum degree. In 1950s Iler and De Boer andVleeskens developed two basic models.
Based on the geometry of spherical SiO
2parti-
cles and the density of amorphous silica ( g2.20
gc m3) Iler [1,23] estimated the number of Si
atoms on the silica surface. The assumption wasthat for each surface Si atom there is one OHgroup, and Iler obtained the silanol numbers ofa
OH7.85 OH nm2[23] and 7.8 OH nm2[1]
by using two calculation variants. However, asBoehm noted [80], only half of the free valency Siatoms are capable of holding OH groups. There-fore, Boehm gives a
OH3.93 OH nm2.
Another model was proposed by De Boer and
Vleeskens [38]. It is based on a concept that thereis a similarity between the density and the refrac-tive index of amorphous and crystalline modiﬁca-tions of silica — cristobalite and that oftridymite. The authors pointed out that sinceb-cristobalite crystallizes in octahedra, the silanol
number should be calculated for the octahedralface {111}. The value for a
OHwas found to be
4.55 OH nm2. The density of a- and b-cristo-
balite and that of a- and b-tridymite lie within a
narrow range: from 2.20 to 2.34 g cm3.B y
considering the most probable cleft surface ofthese SiO
2modiﬁcations the authors concluded
that the silanol number, aOH, lies in the range
from 4.55 to 4.85 OH nm2. The minimal silanol
number for completely hydroxylated SiO2surfaceL.T.Zhura6le6:Colloids and Surfaces A :Physicochem .Eng.Aspects 173 (2000) 1–38 17

tions) is aOH4.690.2 OH nm2. The average
area for a single Si atom on the surface holdingone OH group is 0.217 90.010 nm

sides, De Boer et al. [37,38], in their ther-mogravimetric investigations of wide-poreamorphous SiO

at600°C and then rehydroxylated in an auto-
clave, followed by the removal at 120°C of thephysically adsorbed water, found that a
OH
4.5–5.0 OH nm2. This experimental value is
practically the same as the theoretical one. So,De Boer and Vleeskens were the ﬁrst to obtaina reliable value for a
OH. However, owing to the
non-correct thermogravimetric method they used(for determination of the concentration of OHgroups on the SiO
2surface), De Boer et al.
[37,38] reached the erroneous conclusion that forthe starting hydrated samples of amorphous sil-ica which were not subjected to pretreatment at600°C and then rehydroxylated, a
OH(6–
8)\aOH,MIN 4.6 OH nm2. It is obvious that
such a conclusion fails to take into account thepresence of structural water inside the silica par-ticles and attributes the total loss of mass of thesample after high-temperature annealing only tothe loss of OH groups on the surface.
Zhuravlev, Kiselev et al. in their early works
using the DE method [305–311] determined ex-perimentally for the ﬁrst time the value of a
OH
in the small interval 4.8–5.2 OH nm2on the
surface for the different initial, fully hydroxy-lated samples of the wide-pore silicas. Thesesamples contained OH groups on the surface aswell as structural water inside SiO
2particles,
and the authors observed that dOH:S\aOHor
even dOH:SaOH, i.e. the total content of OH
groups was much more than the content ofsilanols only on the surface.
The theoretical values were reported in litera-
ture for the concentration of OH groups on thesurface of different types of silica [1,23,25,32,38,80,92,159,160,265,285]. These data show thatat present b-cristobalite model of De Boer and
Vleeskens is accepted as the correct one. Thus,for instance, Branda et al. [265], Sindorf andMaciel [159,160] and Chuang and Maciel [285]
when working out their models to describethe surface of amorphous silica, resorted to theconcept developed by De Boer and Vleeskens,but in these models they also took into ac-count the existence on the silica surface of acertain part of geminal silanols (besides the{111} face they considered the {100} face ofb-cristobalite).
As can be seen from Figs. 6 and 7, our exper-
imentally obtained averaged values a
OH,AVER 
4.6 (4.9) OH nm2show that at
maximum-hydroxylated state of the amorphoussilica surface, following the activation of SiO
2in
vacuum at 180–200°C, each Si atom holds ap-proximately one or in some cases two OHgroups (geminal silanols).
To sum up, the magnitude of the silanol num-
ber, which is independent of the origin andstructural characteristics of amorphous silica, isconsidered to be a physico-chemical constant[301–303]. The results fully conﬁrmed the ideapredicted earlier by Kiselev and co-workers[31,32,48] on the constansy of the silanol num-ber for a completely hydroxylated silica surface.This constant now has a numerical value:a
OH,AVER 4.6 (4.9) OH nm2(two calculation
methods, see above) and is known in literatureas the Kiselev–Zhuravlev constant.
The constant a

3.3.Dehydroxylation and rehydroxylation of the
silica surface .Distribution of6arious types of sur -
face groups .Energetic heteregeneity of the silica
surface
Many papers have been published on the differ-
ent aspects of the subject mentioned in the title.This is understandable since the chemistry of thesilica surface as determined mainly by the concen-tration, the distribution and the reactivity of thesurface silanol groups is of theoretical and practi-cal importance.
Let us consider the dehydroxylation process of
the silica surface. The DE method was used todetermine the average value of the silanol num-ber, depending on the temperature of pretreat-ment in vacuo. The experimental results obtainedfor 16 samples of amorphous silica are shown inFig. 9. The samples differed from one another inthe method of their synthesis and their structuralcharacteristics: the speciﬁc surface area of thesamples varied from 11 to 905 m
2g1, and their
porosity also varied within a wide range. Despitethese differences the value of a
OHat a given
temperature of treatment is similar for all thesamples, and the decrease in the value of a
OH
under similar heating conditions also follows ap-
proximately the same pattern. In Table 6 (column2) are presented the most probable values of
aOHaOH,T (concentration of the total OH
groups averaged according to data in Fig. 9),beginning with the state of maximum hydroxyla-tion (180–200°C, the ﬁrst line), followed by thevalues for the degree of surface coverage with thetotal hydroxyl groups, u
OHuOH,T (column 8)
[301–303]. As can be seen from data in Fig. 9 andTable 6, the total values of a
OHdecrease consider-
ably in the range from 200 to about 400°C; be-tween 400 and 1100°C decrease becomes notablysmaller. Correspondingly the total value of u
OHin
the ﬁrst steep section of the plot decreases from 1to about 0.5, and in the second, more ﬂat sectionit drops from 0.5 to very small values approach-ing zero.
Our results [301–303,305–311,313–315,317,
334–338] accord well with the data on the dehy-droxylation of the amorphous silica surface ob-tained by Fripiat, Uytterhoeven et al. [58,74].These authors determined the silanol number a
OH
on the basis of the reaction of OH groups with
organometallic reagents CH3Li and CH3MgI.
Similarly, there is good agreement between ourresults and the data obtained by Taylor, Hockeyet al. [73,82]. Here a
OHwas determined by the
weight loss upon the heating of the SiO2samples
from 115 to 1100°C. Also, the data of Unger[112,146] derived from the reaction of OH groupswith CH
3Li and the heavy water HTO accord well
with our results. There is a qualitative agreementbetween our results and the data as reported byPapee [24], Gokcek and Boehm [80,81] and sev-eral other authors. The b-cristobalite models of
dehydroxylation process as developed by Brandaet al. [265], Sindorf and Maciel [159,160] andChuang and Maciel [285] support the evidence ofa two-stage temperature dependence of the silanolnumber a
OH.
Based on data in Table 6 (columns 2 and 8) it
is possible to assess the most probable values ofa
OHand uOHwithin a wide range of temperatures
for the treatment of SiO2samples. These values
are independent of the degree of silica dispersive-ness if the starting samples have been obtainedunder the condition of a completely hydroxylatedsurface. Many researchers use in their studies ourfunctionality of a

mogram 9 obtained by the MTA-TPD methodand recorded by an electronic potentiometer. Thisdifferential thermal desorption curve, owing to itsnearness to the boundary curve 8 (Fig. 5), showspractically the complete spectrum of the hydroxylgroups removed from the silica surface. At ﬁrstthis surface corresponds to the maximum level ofhydroxylation, while at the end of the heating athigh temperature it becomes strongly dehydroxy-lated. In its appearance the thermogram (curve 9)is similar to the thermal kinetic curve obtained byYoung [41]. Its asymmetric form also indicates theenergetic non-uniformity of the surface.
It should be noted that both in the case of the
thermogram curve 9 and in the case of otherkinetic curves 1–7 and 10–13 (Figs. 5 and 10)there is a characteristic dip B on the descendingABC section. The differential curve 14 (Fig. 5)with a maximum in the region of the dip B wasdrawn by extrapolation, taking into account theform of the ascending section of the neighboringthermogram (curve 15). The beginning of thisthermogram (curve 14) corresponds to about400°C and coincides with the temperature corre-sponding to a change in the slope of two descend-ing and approximately rectilinear sections of thetemperature dependence of the silanol numbera
OH(Fig. 9). Therefore both the dip B itself and
the ascending section of curve 14 which passesthrough such a dip B practically delimit the differ-ent kinds of silanol groups on the silica surface(see below). The kinetic parameters for differentthermograms 9–17 are summarized in Tables 4and 8, and as can be seen from Fig. 11, theexperimentally determined kinetic order of thethermal desorption reaction n$2 for the whole

The dependence of the activation energy of

Don the temperature (Fig. 12) in
region II is characterized by two approximatelyrectilinear sections: in the range from 190 toabout 400°C (subregion IIa) and above 400°C(subregion IIb), with a notable change in the slopeas one goes from the ﬁrst to the second section.Here too, the change in the slope at 400°C
corresponds to the change in the slope at the sametemperature between two sections of the tempera-ture dependence of a
OH(Fig. 9).as a set of physico-chemical constants (at ﬁxed
temperatures).
Let us consider in detail the data obtained by
the MTA-TPD method (Fig. 5). These data coverthe entire region II which is conﬁned to the left ofthe ascending section of the curve 8 and encom-passes thermograms 9–17. After preliminary ther-mal treatment in vacuo under the given condition(Table 1) the standard silica samples S-79 wereﬁrst subjected to cooling up to room temperatureand then to linear heating in the 25–1000°C tem-perature range. It should be noted that the ap-pearance of each separate mass thermogramwithin90.5°C corresponded to the temperature
of the preliminary treatment for a given sample.We have here a clear manifestation of ‘the charac-teristic memory effect’ of the silica surface and itshydroxyl coverage with respect to the temperatureof preliminary thermal treatment in vacuo. Also,as noted above, with an increase in temperature ofpreliminary treatment of the S-79 sample there isan increase in temperature in region II whichcorresponds to the maximum of each individualmass thermogram (Fig. 5 and Table 1). All thisconﬁrms the fact that the silica surface which hasbeen subjected to different degrees of hydroxyla-tion is energetically non-uniform.L.T.Zhura6le6:Colloids and Surfaces A :Physicochem .Eng.Aspects 173 (2000) 1–38 21

From the known temperature dependences of
the activation energy and the silanol number inregion II we can obtain the dependence of theactivation energy of dehydroxylation, E

concentration of OH groups, aOH, or the depen-
dence of EDon the extent to which silica is
covered with hydroxyl groups, uOH, as shown in
Fig. 13 [302,303,332].
The second order of the reaction (Tables 4 and
8 and Fig. 11) observed for the entire region II isdirect conﬁrmation of associative desorption,which proceeds as a result of the reaction betweenthe surface silanol groups (condensation) leadingto the formation of siloxane bonds and molecularwater:

Thus, the condensation, Eq. (8), is characteris-
tic of both subregions (IIa and IIb) despite thefact that the activation energies, E
D, for these
sections differ signiﬁcantly (Figs. 12 and 13).

surface of SiO2were determined (together with

ever, the intensity of the absorption band of freeisolated hydroxyl groups increases in the tempera-ture interval from 200 to about 400°C, while

[238], which is based on the IR band shift offree isolated OH groups as a function of tempera-ture; (6) the model of Van Der Voort et al.[237,263], which is based on the integration of IRbands due to different types of OH groups; and(7) the model of Fink et al. [190], which is basedon the deconvolution of the summed-up IR bandinto constituent components belonging to differ-ent types of silanol groups. It can be seen fromFig. 15 that almost all models 1–7 are situated inthe error region. This shows good agreement be-tween the data obtained by different researchers.Furthermore, it conﬁrms the existence of a realtemperature distribution of free isolated silanols,with a maximum at about 400°C. It is necessaryto note that Yaroslavsky, by using the IR spec-troscopy method, discovered for the ﬁrst time [11]a qualitative temperature course of free isolatedOH groups with the maximum at about 500°C.
Thus, our results (Figs. 9 and 12–14) indicate
that the dehydroxylation of the silica surface pro-ceeds via two stages: subregion IIa and subregionIIb.centration of vicinal OH groups, a
OH,V, at 200–
400°C (Fig. 14, curve 3) and the concentration ofsurface Si atoms, a
Si, that are part of the siloxane
bridges/p13SiOSi/p13 and free of hydroxyl
groups, throughout the range of temperatures(Fig. 14, curve 4) can be determined from thetotal concentration of OH groups, a
OH,T, and the
concentration of free isolated OH groups, aOH,I.
On the basis of our data one can calculate the
average value of the area occupied by one OHgroup, v
OH(nm2), as well as the average distance
between these groups, L(nm), at temperature
range of 200–1100°C (Table 7). Our IR spectro-scopic investigations (together with Davydov andKiselev) [309] showed that the difference instretching vibrations between the band of free OHgroups (3750 cm
1) and the band due to vicinal
OH groups (maximum at 3550 cm1)i sDn:
200 cm1. According to Lippincott and
Schroeder [347], the value for Dncorresponds to a
probable OH…O distance of 0.295 nm. This
gives vOH$0,068 nm2per one vicinal OH group.
It is not difﬁcult to calculate the other values ofv
OHand L. Since these OH groups are distributed
at random, we can assume that their distributionis uniform throughout the silica surface. In thiscase, the average areas per one group, v
OH, and
the average distances, L, between them remainL.T.Zhura6le6:Colloids and Surfaces A :Physicochem .Eng.Aspects 173 (2000) 1–38 24
Let us consider the case where the degree of
coverage of the silica surface with OH groups ishigh, 1]u
OH\0.5, which corresponds to subre-
gion IIa (Fig. 13). This range is characterized bythe linear energetic non-uniformity on the surface,which is described by the following empiricalrelationship:
E
D31.412.3uOH (9)
where EDis the energy of activation in the range
19–25 kcal mol1(the values EDfor the initial
non-linear section in Fig. 13 are from 16.5 to 19kcal mol
1). This activation energy EDis almost
independent of the silanol concentration and isdetermined mainly by a set of perturbations dueto vicinal OH groups. These perturbations ceasewith the disappearance of the vicinal groups at400°C (at u
OH$0.5). Thus, the subregion IIa is
characterized by the presence of lateral interac-tions (hydrogen bonds) between the neighboringOH groups.
Let us consider the coverage of the silica sur-
face with hydroxyl groups u
OHB0.5, which corre-
sponds to subregion IIb (Fig. 13). In this case, themain role is played by free isolated hydroxylgroups and siloxane bridges. This subregion E

strongly dependent on the concentration of hy-droxyl groups, i.e. the activation energy of des-orption is in the range from 25 to 50 kcal
mol
1(and probably higher), and increases with
a decrease in the concentration of the OH groups.When there are only free isolated silanols (and,perhaps, free geminals, see below) surrounded bysiloxane SiOSi bridges, the latter bridges can ac-quire a relatively large area following high tem-perature treatment of SiO
2. Under these
conditions the main mechanism describing thetransfer of OH groups corresponds to condensa-tion Eq. (8) via disordered migration of protonson the surface (a process of the activated diffusionof OH groups). At the ﬁnal stage, water isevolved, owing to the interaction of two OHgroups that accidentally approach each other to adistance of about 0.3 nm (a characteristic lengthof H-bond). The mechanism describing the migra-tion of protons is not entirely clear. It probablyinvolves the interaction of the protons at elevatedtemperatures with O atoms of the neighboringSiOSi bridges, resulting in the formation of new
surface OH groups, which are displaced relativeto their initial position. In other words, this mech-anism can be represented as the transition fromone local minimum of the potential energy intoanother by means of ‘jumps’ between the neigh-boring siloxane bridges. Obviously, at a low con-centration of OH groups such a diffusion ofprotons along the silica surface will limit thecondensation process Eq. (8).
In the monograph by Vansant et al. [263] are
presented experimental results of Gillis-D’Hamerset al., obtained by the TPD method. These resultspertain to the dehydration and the dehydroxyla-tion of water from the surface of silica gel samplewith a speciﬁc area of 400 m
2g1. The obtained
data on the dependence of the activation energyof water desorption, E
D, on the concentration of
OH groups, aOH, on the silica surface are in good
quality agreement with our previously data[302,303,332], although the absolute values of E
D
exceed our numerical values. Gillis-D’Hamers et
al. have reported the appearance of three approx-imately linear sections. At high values of a
OH
(from 4.5 to 5.0 OH nm2) a sharp decline in ED
is attributed to the transition from dehydration to
dehydroxylation (cf. section in the region of190°C in Fig. 12). At values of a
OHfrom approx-
imately 4.5 to 2.0 OH nm2there appears a
weakly sloping section of EDwhich is due to the
condensation of bridged vicinal OH groups. Thiscorresponds to the subregion IIa in Figs. 12 and13. Finally, at silanol values of a
OHB2.0 OH
nm2the sharply ascending section of EDis due
to the condensation of free hydroxyl groups onthe SiO
2surface, which correspond to the subre-
gion IIb in Figs. 12 and 13 of our work.
In the last two decades, owing ﬁrst of all to the
investigations carried out by Sindorf and Maciel[159,160] and others based on
29Si NMR spectro-
scopic measurements, it became possible to differ-entiate between single silanols and geminalsilanols on the silica surface. These results conﬁ-rmed the hypothesis proposed earlier by Peri andHensley [79,92].
Therefore, it was necessary to correct our re-
sults on the distribution of silanols with accounttaken of the presence of geminal silanols on theL.T.Zhura6le6:Colloids and Surfaces A :Physicochem .Eng.Aspects 173 (2000) 1–38 25
SiO2surface. Data on the content of geminal
silanols we took from the works of Sindorf andMaciel, and this correction is based on the tem-perature dependence of the relative concentrationof geminal silanols (%) on the SiO
2surface
[159,160,263]. In Table 6 (columns 2–7 and 8–12), the surface concentrations of all the differenttypes of silanol groups and the degree of surfacecoverage by these groups on amorphous silicathat has been thermally pretrated in vacuo at atemperature range from 180–200 to 1200°C,
are summarized. Also are shown the concentra-tions and the degree of surface coverage of Siatoms and SiOSi groups, which are free of OHgroups, on the silica surface. In Fig. 16 a graphicrepresentation of our model is shown (model-2):the distribution of all total OH groups and theseparate distribution of three types of silanolgroups (isolated, geminal and vicinal silanols),and Si atoms and SiOSi groups, as a function of
the pretreatment temperature in vacuo.The correction, introduced for the geminal OH
groups, indicates (Table 6) that at temperatures]400°C the concentration curve for the single
free OH groups (model-1, Fig. 14, curve 2) isdecomposed in single isolated (free) and geminal(free) curves for the silanol groups (model-2, Fig.16, curves 2 and 4, respectively). With regard tofree isolated and free geminal OH groups, it canbe considered that in the ﬁrst approximation thesegroups occupy about the same area v
OHat a
given pretreatment temperature (see Table 7).
Next we shall consider the rehydroxylation pro-
cess of the SiO2surface. When the dehydroxylated
surface of silica reacts with water in a vapor orliquid state silanol groups are formed, or, in otherwords, rehydroxylation takes place (Fig. 1(b)). Ithas been pointed out in the literature[35,37,38,41,121] that complete hydroxylation ofthe surface can be achieved only for those samplesof silica which were subjected to preliminarytreatment at temperatures below 400°C. After
calcination at higher temperature only partial re-hydroxylation takes place.
However, as has been shown in our work [326],
the dehydroxylated surface of silica samples ﬁrstactivated in the range from 400 to 1000–1100°Ccan be completely restored to the maximum hy-droxylated state ( a
OH4.6 OH nm2) by treat-
ment with water at room temperature. Forsamples subjected to more extensive dehydroxyla-tion, it takes more time to obtain complete rehy-droxylation. Thus, for a starting wide-pore silicasample ( S340 m
2g1) that had been calcined
in air at 900°C ( aOH0.66 OH nm2) it took
about 5 years, during which the sample was incontact with liquid water at room temperature,before the complete rehydroxylation of its surfacewas achieved ( a
OH5.30 OH nm2). To acceler-
ate rehydroxylation we subjected the silica sam-ples to hydrothermal treatment at 100°C (sampleswere boiled in water) [307,311,326]. The startingaerosilogel ( S168 m
2g1) was calcined in
vacuo at 1100°C for 10 h ( aOH0.06 OH nm2).
Then the sample was boiled in water for 60 h andits speciﬁc surface area was found to be S108
m
2g1and the silanol number aOH4.60 OH
nm2(Table 5).Fig. 16. Distribution of the surface groups as a function of the

The rehydroxylation of a wide-pore silica gel
sample (calcined in air at 850°C and held in waterat 100°C for 1, 5, 10, 30 and 100 h) was found totake 5–10 h to achieve complete rehydroxylation[326]. These and other results [326] indicate thatrehydroxylation, in the presence of water, of de-hydroxylated silica (calcined at above 400°C) re-quires considerable energy to activate the processof dissociative adsorption, E
A. In other words,
what we have here is the chemisorption of waterresulting in the formation of hydroxyl groupsbound through valence bonds to the SiO
2surface.
The reaction which takes place on the surface isthe opposite of the condensation reaction Eq. (8)and involves the breaking of the surface siloxanebonds.
Thus the rehydroxylation of silica should be
considered to be a process taking place in twosubregions: below and above the temperature ofthe preliminary treatment (about 400°C). Thisaccords well with the two subregions, IIa and IIb,observed in the dehydroxylation process (Figs. 12and 13).
In subregion IIb the silica surface is occupied
only by free hydroxyl groups and siloxanebridges. In suregion IIa, however, there are alsovicinal OH groups bound together by hydrogenbonds.
In analyzing the silica surface we should take
into account the non-uniform nature of the Si O
bonds belonging to silanol groups and siloxanebridges. As is known, the presence of an addi-tional donor acceptor (d–p)
pinteraction of the
SiO bond determines the speciﬁc nature of these
bonds [135].
For strongly dehydroxylated silica the surface
concentration of siloxane groups is high (Figs. 14and 16). As a result of the (d–p)
pconjugation in
the siloxane group, due to the shift in the elec-tronic density as one goes from O atom to Siatom, it is impossible for oxygen which is on thesurface of the sample to form a hydrogen bondwith the adsorbed water molecules, i.e. the silox-ane surface is hydrophobic [135].
The hydroxylated surface with a predominance
of silanol groups is hydrophilic in nature. In thesilanol/p13SiOH group, owing to the same (d–
p)
pinteraction, the electronic density becomesdelocalized from the O H bond to the neighbor-
ing SiO bond [135]. This makes it possible for
the silanol groups to form strong hydrogen bondswith water molecules.
It follows from the data in Figs. 12–14 and 16
that the high rate of rehydroxylation of silicasubjected to preliminary activation at 200–400°C(subregion IIa) is apparently due to the fact thatthe concentration of the siloxane bridges is stilllow and each/p13SiOSi/p13bridge is surrounded
by OH groups. Such a location of the surfacegroups weakens the Si O bond in the siloxane
bridge itself. During the rehydroxylation process,additionally introduced water molecules ﬁrst be-come adsorbed on silanol groups and have adirect effect on the neighboring weakened strainedsiloxane groups. This results in the splitting ofthese siloxane groups and the formation of newOH groups on the surface of silica.
Upon a preliminary activation of SiO
2at above
400°C (subregion IIb) the concentration of thesiloxane bridges increases sharply. These bridgesform whole hydrophobic regions on the surface,while the concentration of OH groups drops withan increase in temperature (Figs. 9, 12–14 and16). But even under the condition of maximumactivation (1000–1100°C), free OH groups canstill exist, but are at a large distance from oneanother (Tables 6 and 7). These OH groups act asthe centers of adsorption when an additionalamount of water is introduced, and rehydroxyla-tion takes place ﬁrst in the vicinity of the silanolgroups. The hydroxylated sections that are local-ized in the shape of small spots gradually expand.Subsequent rehydroxylation proceeds along theboundary separating the hydrophilic and hydro-phobic sections. Such rehydroxylation of the sur-face is due to the considerable energy ofactivation of adsorption, E
A[302,303,326]. This
means that rehydroxylation, due to dissociativeadsorption (chemisorption) of H
2O with the split-
ting of siloxane bridges and the formation of newOH groups, proceeds according to a differentmechanism, depending on the coverage of thesurface with OH groups, u
OH.
At 1]uOH\0.5 (subregion IIa, Fig. 13) the
activation energy of chemisorption, EA, is close to
zero. For this subregion we can write that ED:L.T.Zhura6le6:Colloids and Surfaces A :Physicochem .Eng.Aspects 173 (2000) 1–38 27
Scheme 2. Bergna’s scheme.but more hardly and at a slower rate (subregion
IIb, Fig. 13).
Thus, it is necessary to emphasize that the
rehydroxylation process, which is due to the dis-sociative adsorption of water involving the split-ting of siloxane bridges and the formation of newOH groups, takes place via: (a) the rapid nonacti-vated (or weakly activated) chemisorption (subre-gion IIa); and (b) the slow strongly activatedchemisorption (subregion IIb).
3.4.Physico -chemical model of amorphous silica
surface :main stages
Let us consider the main stages of our physico-
chemical model of the SiO2surface.
3.4.1.Stage 1:the initial stage (25°C,in6acuo ):
the SiO2surface is in a maximum state of
hydroxylation ( uOH1, aOH4.60 OH
nm2);
all the different types of silanol groups (iso-
lated singles, geminals, vicinals) are present;
the SiO2surface is covered with physically
adsorbed water (multiple layers of H2O),
uH2O\1;
the surface OH groups and adsorbed water are
permeated with a H-bond network;
the internal OH groups are present inside theSiO
2skeleton.

the ﬁrst threshold temperature ( T125°C, in
vacuo);
complete removal of multiple layers of physi-cally adsorbed water;
the process is readily reversible upon the intro-duction of an excess of water.
3.4.3.Stage 2 (25 –190°C,in6acuo ,the region I ,
Fig.12)
the SiO2surface is in a maximum state of
hydroxylation ( uOH1, aOH4.60 OH
nm2);QA[70], where QAis a heat of chemisorbption
which varies from 16.5 to 25 kcal mol1(see
Eq. (9)). The heat of chemisorption QAdecreases
insigniﬁcantly with an increase in uOH.
At uOHB0.5 (subregion IIb, Fig. 13)
chemisorption proceeds very slowly at room tem-perature, but the rate of reaction increases sharplywith an increase in the reaction temperature to100°C. The physical adsorption of water onsilanol groups precedes chemisorption. The latteris strongly activated, or E
A\0. It can be ex-
pressed as

where EDvaries from 25 to about 50 kcal mol1
and probably higher (Fig. 13).
An analysis has been carried out of data re-
ported in literature from the point of view ofwhether stable or strained siloxane bridges andsiloxane rings are located on the surface of amor-phous silica. This analysis shows that at presentthere is still no agreement among the researcherson this question. On the basis of our experimentaldata described above we are of the same opinionwhich has been stated in a review by Bergna [256]and which can be seen in Scheme 2.
According to this scheme strained weakened
siloxane bridges are formed on the hydroxylatedsilica surface owing to a thermally induced con-densation process of vicinal silanols. Such/p13SiOSi/p13bridges exist at temperatures up to
approximately 400°C. At high concentrations ofOH groups which surround the bridges and acton the Si O bonds these strained weakened silox-
ane bridges are readily broken and the surface iscompletely rehydroxylated in the presence of anadditional amount of water (subregion IIa, Fig.13). At higher temperatures and without vicinalOH groups on the surface, the strained siloxanegroups are converted into stable siloxane bridgesand rings, which are also able to rehydroxylateL.T.Zhura6le6:Colloids and Surfaces A :Physicochem .Eng.Aspects 173 (2000) 1–38 28

4. Conclusions
The results of our experimental and theoretical
studies, together with the data published in litera-ture, permitted to construct the model for describ-ing the surface chemistry of amorphous silica[301–303,332,334,336–338].
It has been shown that in any description of the
surface of amorphous silica the hydroxylation ofthe surface is of critical importance. There is adifference between the surface hydroxyl (silanol)Fig. 21. Transition from stage 4 to 5 ( T4:900°C, see text).

groups and other types of bound water such as
physically adsorbed water and hydroxyl groupsinside the silica skeleton and the very narrowultramicropores. An analysis was made of theprocesses of dehydration (the removal of physi-cally adsorbed water), dehydroxylation (the re-moval of silanol groups from the silica surface),and rehydroxylation (the restoration of the hy-droxylated covering). The probable mechanismsfor explaining the observed processes aredescribed.
The main advantage of our physico-chemical
model (model-1, model-2) lies in the possibility ofdetermination the concentration and the distribu-tion of different types of silanol and siloxanegroups on the silica surface as a function of thepretreatment temperature of SiO
2samples, and in
the possibility assessing of OH groups inside thesilica particles. This model also makes it possibleto characterize the energetic heterogeneity of thesilica surface and to determine the kind of thechemisorption of water (rapid, weakly activatedor slow, strongly activated) under the restorationof the hydroxyl coverage, within a wide tempera-ture interval of thermal treatment in vacuo.
On the basis of the surface concentration of
silanol groups we have established that adsorbtionand other surface properties per unit surface areaof silica are identical (except for very ﬁne pores).
The high value of the correlation coefﬁcient
(r0.99) of the linear regression equation be-
tween the surface concentration of OH groups perunit mass of the SiO
2sample, dOH(S), and the spe-
ciﬁc surface area of the SiO2sample, SKr, i.e.
between numbers of two independent each fromother physical magnitudes, changing within verywide ranges, conﬁrms that the BET method is thecorrect method and gives the opportunity to mea-sure the real physical size of the speciﬁc surfacearea for dispersed silicas (and other oxide dis-persed solids).
Based on data reported in literature, our model
of the amorphous silica surface is today the mostadvanced model. It has been found useful insolving various applied and theoretical problemsin the ﬁeld of adsorption, catalysis, chromatogra-phy, chemical modiﬁcation, etc.The regularities established for the amorphous
silica surface in the proposed model can be ap-plied to other, more complex silica containingsystems and related materials (silicates) as well tovarious solid oxide substances containing OHgroups on their surface.
In the future, for a more detailed analysis of the
chemical properties of the silica surface it is neces-sary to take into account the presence on the silicasurface of the following: other possible functionalgroups and active sites, radicals, structural de-fects, impurities, etc.
