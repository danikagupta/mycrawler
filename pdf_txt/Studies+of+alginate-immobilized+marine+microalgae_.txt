Abstract:  
Immobilization of microalgae, as part of a global trend of immobilizing  microorganisms in an assortment of matrices, is 
used for a  wide variety of biotechnological applications that started over  40 years ago. The types of immobil ization  can be grouped 
as passive  (natural or synthetic) and active  (flocculant agents, chemical a ttachment, and gel encapsulation) . Adsorbent s (carriers) 
for passive immobilization can be natural or synthetic.  Attachment of periphyton t o different surfaces,  used in ecology studies  was 
discussed . The use of flocculant agents, chemical attachment and gel entrapment methods should be differentiated in active 
immobilization techniques . Gel entrapment in natural polysaccharide matric es is the most widely used immobilization technique for 
microalgae in particular. Carrageenan, agar and alginate are the mos t employed among them.  These systems produce no health 
hazards, are environmental  friendly , produce no secondary pollution. There are still a number of technical aspects of this technology  
that could be developed . A general perspective  of the field with  known examples from common literature  was presented in this 
review.

Introduction:   
The use of microalgae in biotechnology has been increased in recent years, these organisms being 
implicated in food, cosmetic, aquaculture and pharmaceutical industries (Borowitzka & Borowitzka, 1988 .), but small 
size of single cells implies a problem in the application of biotechnological processes to those organisms. In order to 
solve those pr oblems , cell immobilization techniques have been prospered (Jyothi , 2016 ). An immobilized cell is 
defined as a living cell that, by natural or  artificial means, is prevented from moving independently from its  original 
location to all parts of an aqueous phase of a system  (Ramakrishna and Prakasham, 1999 ; Tampion and Tampion, 
1987 ). The concealed  concept is that  immobilized microalgae in ma trices may assist the required biotechnological 
applications from the mass culture of the microalgae, either a specific metabolite or removal of pollutants. This 
concept evolved from the basic nature of its components, the microalgae and the immobilizing m atrix (Luz and Yoav , 
2010 ). Most of the general immobilization techniques for microorganisms can be easily modified and applied to 
microalgae, adding a design factor that these are photosynthetic microorganisms that require light.  Six different 
immobilization types have been defined: covalent coupling, affinity immobilization, adsorption, confinement in liquid –
liquid emulsion, capture behind semi -permeable membrane, and entrapment in polymers (Mallick, 2002). These 
types of immobila tion can be grouped as ‘‘passive” (using the natural tendency of microorganisms to attach to 
surfaces – natural or synthetic – and grow on them) and ‘‘active” (flocculant agents, chemical attachment, and gel 
encapsulation) (Cohen, 2001; Moreno -Garrido,  2008). 
 
Passive immobilization  
 
Adsorption  
Many microorganisms (including some groups of microalgae)  have a natural tendency to attach to surfaces 
and grow o n them (Robinson et al., 1986).  This characteristic  can be exploited in order to immobilize cells on carriers  
of different types (Codd, 1987 ). These processes  are easily reversible . Adsorbent materials (carriers)  for passive 
immobilization can be natural or synthetic.  With respe ct to natural carriers,  efforts have been  made involving loofa 
biomass. Loofa sponges are the  fibrous support of the fruit of different species from the  genus Luffa ( L. cylindrical:  L. 
aegyptiaca,  L. operculata, L. acutangula ). This carrier  is non -toxic, non-reactive, cheap,  mechanically strong and 
stable in long -term cultures  (Liu et al., 1998). Akhtar et al. (2004) used loofa sponge biomass  in order to immobilize 
cells of Chlorella sorokiniana , to remove nickel  (II) from aqueous solutions . This immobilized  system demonstrated to 
accumulate 25% more nickel  than free cells after 20 min exposition. Ogbonn et al.  (1996) reported the possibility of 
the co -use of chitosan  in order to increase the flocculating process of free cells  over the loofa surfaces , for cells that 
have no natural trend to  attach this type of support . A pro blem on designing research  involving loofa sponge biomass 
is repeatability. Structure  of the skeleton of fruits varies from a plant to another in  function of culturing conditions,

 each loofa sponge has different  structure (Liu et al., 1998).  Passive immobilization of algal  cells on loofa sponges 
seems to be a very promising field  for industry or commercial purposes.  
  
Synthetic materials are  also widely used in  passive immobilization  experiments . Urrutia et al. (1995)  
immobilized Scenedesmus obliquus  cells in polyvinyl and  polyurethane in ord er to remove nitrate from water and also 
compared  the s urviva l of adsorbed cells with entrapped cells  by mixing concentrated cells with one of the pre -
polymers.  Cellular growth  was found to be  higher for adsorbed cells than for entrapped cells, possibly due to the 
toxicity of the  pre-polymers . Yamaguchi et al. (1999) achieved  a noticeable degradation of hydrocarbons by the 
colorless  hydrophobic microalgae Prototheca zopfii , adsorbed to  8 mm-cubes of polyurethane foam in a bubble 
reactor.  Huang et al., 2003 , immobilized Chlorella pyrenoidosa  in polyvinyl acetate (PVA) sulfate  for removing nitrate 
and phosphate , showed that the microalgae reproduced rapidly inside a PVA gel carrier under pH ranging from 5 to 
10. The immobilized system had higher removal efficiency in the water when close to neutral pH and efficiency to 
remove nitrate reached 80%; meanwhile, the highest efficiency for removing phosphate was 88%, but decreased 
over time to 56% (Huang et al., 2003) . Similarly Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus acutus  had been immobilisesd 
by Travieso et al. (1999) in Polyurethane foam for removal of chromium.   Kannaiyan et al., 1997 , immobilized  the 
nitrogen -fixing  cyanobacteria Anabaena azollae  in polyurethane foam . Foam -immobilized  cyanobacteria treated with 
fungicides stimulate nitrogenase activity  and increase ammonia production at significantly higher rates.  Inoculation of 
rice field with this formulation significantly  increases ammonia that  the cyanobacteria excrete into the  flood water of 
the rice fields, increases chlorophyll content of the  plants, and eventually increases rice grain and straw yields.  The 
cyanobacterium Phormidium  laminosum,  immobilized on polymer foams, was demonstrated t o have potential value 
for removing nitrates in a continuous -flow system (Garbisu et al., 199 3). Spirulina maxima  immobilized in  polymers 
enhance d removed  more than 90% of ammonium from  waste  water  (Canizares et al.  1993).  Attachment of periphyton 
to different surfaces can also  be used in ecology studies. Admiraal et al. (1999) used  microbenthic algae colonizing 
glass discs to  measure different levels  of metal pollution. Danilov and Ekelund (2001) compare  settlement patterns of 
periphyton on glass, wood and plastic  in different lakes , noticed glass is the most preffered material to attach on than 
wood and plastic. Diatoms  attachment to glass  slides and population growth on this type  of surfaces has been 
studied by Brandini et al. (2001) in a  subtropi cal estuary a whole year, comparing the  differences caused by depth, 
light,  temperature and grazing pressure. Nayar et al. (2005) also  studied the settlement of diatom species 
(Skeletonema costatum and Thalassiosira rotula ) together with cyanophytes (Synechococcus  sp.,) in glasses in a  
tropical estuary of Singapore . Robinson et al., 1986  have been used g lass-immobilized  filaments of Anabaena  sp.,  in 
hydrogen  production experiments . These support  materials can be used with species  showing natural tendency  to 
attach and aggregate ( diatoms  and cyanophytes) .  
 
Active immobilization  
 The use of flocculant agents, chemical attachment and gel entrapment methods should be differentiated in 
active immobilization techniques  
  
Flocculant agents  
In order to avoid  tediuos  centrifugation when algae are intended to be removed from a liquid medium  
flocculant agents were  used . Chitosan has been the most  widely used among the  flocculants . Chitosan is a linear 
amino polysaccharide  of b-D-glucosamine (2 -amino -2-deox y-b-D-glucan)  units joined by (1,  4)-linkages (Oungbho 
and Muller,  1997). It is obtained through  chitin (obtained from exoskeletons  of crustaceans) alkaline deacetylation. 
This polysaccharide  posess positive -charged amino groups,  provi ding sites  for adsorbing negative  charged particles 
and it is proved  to be useful  for a huge  number of microalgal species (Lubian, 1989).  As it is biodegradable, it  can be 
used in  harvesting of algae for nutritional purposes  (Gualtieri et al.,  1988) . The inconvenien ce of chitosan in 
immobilizing techniques  is its weak stability.   High viscosity chitosan gels (2% p/v) showed  a higher chemical stability 
in the experiments . Chitosan can interfere in the growth of immobilized  algae. Moreira  et al. (2006) found low growth 
rates   of Phaeodactylum  tricornutum immobilized in alginate treated with  chitosan as additional hardener, while cells 
immobilized in  alginate beads hardened with CaCl 2 or SrCl 2 showed  increasing rates  of 30  and 76 times, respectively.  
Scenedesmus sp . when immobilized in chitosan, showed higher growth rate  and accomplished a 70% nitrate and 
94% phosphate removal within 12 h of incubation  (Fierro et al., 2008).

 Chemical attachment    
Chemical interaction causes damages in cellular surface and reduces viability of cells hence it is not 
recommended when living cells are intended to be immobilized.  The  effectiveness of Ion attraction  depends on pH 
and ionic strength of the surrounding media (Codd, 1987).  Neverthless , some experiments do not require  active 
metabolism of cells, and non -living organisms are  used in chemical attachment immobilization techniques.  The 
adsorption  capacity of two floc -type biosorbents (milk casein floccules and glutaraldehyde)  was compared  in order to 
remove  a Heterosigma ak ashiwo  a marine microalga that can accumulate  Cd and Pb from aqueous solution  (Seki 
and Suzuki, 2002).   
 
Gel entrapment  
It is the  widely used technique for algal  immobilization. G el entrapment  can be performed by the use of 
synthetic polymers (acrylamide,  photocrosslinkable resins, polyurethanes), proteins  (gelatine, collagen or egg white) 
and natural polysaccharides  (agars, carrageenans or alginates)  (Codd ,1987) . 
 
 Synthetic polymers for gel entrapment . 
Microalgae are immobilized in various  polymers for different biotechnological purposes, such as morphology  
studies, production of fine chemicals, energy production, and  wastewater treatment (Lebeau and Robert,  2006; 
Ignacio , 2008).  In polymeric immobilization systems, similar to  other  biofiltration systems, there is physical separation 
between  the microorganisms and the treated wastewater.  The microorganisms  are immobilized (trapped) alive within 
the polymer because  its pores are smaller than the  microorganisms, while the fluid  flows through it and s ustains their 
metabolism and eventual  growth (Cohen, 2001).  Immobilization in polymers is especifically important in wastewater 
treament because it solves the inherent problem of biomass produced by suspended microalgae in the wastewater  
(Travieso et al., 1992; Valderrama et al., 2002).  Several synthetic (acrylamide, polyurethane, polyvinyl, resins)  and 
natural polymer derivatives  of algal  polysaccharides (alginate,  carrageenan, agar, agarose), and chitosan, an amino 
polysaccharide  derived from chitin, has been experimentally used. Regardless of  the polymers used, the material 
must be hydrophilic, allowing  wastewater to diffuse into the bead. The most commonly used  natural polymers are 
alginate and carrageenan (Bashan,  1998; Ignacio  ,2008 ). Some natural poly mers can dissolve in highly contaminated  
wastewater, while synthetic polymers do not. Also, natural polymers  are more vulnerable to environmental 
degradation by microbes.  However, diffusivity is higher in natural polymers and  they are less hazardous  (Leene n et 
al., 1996).  
The microbial suspension  is mixed with the polymer and then,  the mixture is solidified to produce a 
polymeric  gel, by linking the monomers to each  other to form a polymer with as little interaction with the living  
microorganisms, leaving the microbes inside  the matrix intact. Polymerization can be achieved by several physical  
and chemical treatments . Solidification can be done by linking the monomers  with di - and multi -valen t cations . The 
rate of  solidification can be increased or decrease d by changing the  temperature and different chemical and 
photochemical reactions  (Cohen, 2001). The mechanical strength of the final polymer increases  with the increase in 
concentration of the monomers and the  cross -linking agents used. Spherical beads  are made by slowly dropping the 
mixture through a small orifice, such as a syringe  or specific equipment designed for that purpose . Once produced, 
the beads can be used directly or with secondary  multiplication in a growth medium to increase the number of  
microorga nisms within the bead  ( Bashan et al.,  2002). Beads also can be dried, as for agricultural inoculants 
(Bashan  et al., 2002)  or when used with dead biomass . Immobili sed microalgae showed several improvements in the 
metabolism, function, and  behavior of the microalgae . Immobilization in alginate  beads of the hydrocarbon -rich 
microalgae, Botryococcus braunii  and Botryococcus protuberans , yielded a significant increase in  chlorophyll, 
carotenoids, dry weight, and lipids during the stationary  and resting growth phases, compared to free -living cells. 
Photosynthesis  in both species was enhanced, relative to free cells  with delayed  senesce nce (Singh, 2003). 
Immobilization  in chitosan protected the cell walls of Synechococcus sp.  against NaOH toxicity , showed better growth  
than free cell cultures (Aguilar -May et al., 2007).  Blanco et al. (1999)  entrapped  Phormidium laminosum  in 
Polysulphone (a thermoplastic material) and epoxy resin  (bisphenol and epichlorohydrin) to check the biosorption 
capacity of  Cu(II), Fe(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) . Epoxy resins  are not suitable for entrapping living cells  because of their 
toxicity of the components . Thepenier et al. (1985) has been  immobilized Porphyridium  cruentum  cells in 
polyurethane  foam  for produc tion of polysaccharides. Jeon et al. (2002)  , described the technique of immobilizing in 
polyvinyl alcohols  and glutaraldehyde . Silica gels can be used for immobilizing microalgal  cells. Rangasayatorn et al. 
(2004)  check ed the cadmium adsorption  by immobilized Spirulina platensis  in alginate and silica gel . Cadmium  J. Algal Biomass Utln .  2017, 8(1): 64 -70                            Micro  algal Immobilization T echniques

 adsorption of silica gel entrapping cells is as high  as the alginate entrapped cells . Stark and Rayson (2000) used  
immobilized polysi licate materials ( Chlorella vulgaris cells)  in comparing metal  ion binding capacit ies. 
 
Natural pol ysaccharides for gel entrapment  
  Gel entrapment in natural polysaccharide matric es is the most  widely used immobilization technique for  
microalgae in particular . Carrageenan, agar and alginate are the most employed  among them . Carrageenan is a term 
for polysaccharides prepared  from some Rhodophyceae  ( from the families Gigartinacieae and Solieriaceae)  by water 
alkaline extraction . Carrageenan consists of  alternating 3 -linked -b-D-galactopyranose and 4 -linked -a-D-
galactopiranose units. It precipitates as a gel in the presence  of cationic compounds  such as metal ions, amines, 
amino  acid derivates and water -miscible organic solvents (Tosa  et al., 1979). D ifferent isomeric forms of carrageenan  
(i, j and k ) are primarily p roduced  by Aghardhiella subulata and Chondrus crispus  (Burdin and  Bird, 1994). Hardening 
processes in order to increase the  mechanical stability of carrageenan -based matrixes have  also been designed 
(Chamy et al. , 1990) . Travieso et al. (1996) compared  the nutrient removal capacity of three microalgal  species 
(C.vulgaris, Chlorella kessleri  and Scenedesmus  quadricauda ) immobilized in different matrixes including  j-
carrageenan. Agar is a sulphated galactan obtained from some species  of red algae (from the genus Gelidium, 
Pterocladia  or Gracilaria ) (Burdin and Bird, 1994). The major gel forming component of agar  (agarose) consists of a 
linear chain of sequences of (1 –3) linked -b-D-galactopyranosyl units and (1 –4)-linkages to  3,6-anhydr o-a-D-
galactopyranosyl units.  Agar is a thermoreversible  gel. This polymer is best suitable for immobilizing microalgal cells  
(Codd, 1987 and Papageorgiou,1987) . Agar melts around 850C and solidifies  between 35 - 400C. Species able to 
resist a short  thermal  shock of this level should be selected for agar  immobilizatio n. Temperatures  over 300C could 
damage a wide variety of marine  microalgae (except cyanophytes and some species from the genus Dunaliella, 
Nannochloropsis  or Tetraselmis) . Agarose has been used as an immobilization  matrix type fixed -bed for C. vulgaris in 
experiments  of Cu  (II) biosorption (Aksu et al., 1998). They  reported that metal adsorption  capacity of agarose –
micro algae  system  was lower than that reported for Ca -alginate in the same  conditions. Immobilization of Dunaliella 
salina in agar significantly improved production of glycerol, in comparison with  free-living cells (Thakur and Kumar, 
1999).  
The most widely used polysaccharide gel for entrapping  living cells is alginate. Alginate s constitute a family 
of unbranched binary copolymers of 1 –4-linked -b-D-mannuronic  acid and a -L-guluronic acid  (Smidsrod and Skja  k-
Braek, 1990) . Commercial alginates are extracted from brown algae,  mainly from the genus Laminaria (L.  
hyperborea, L. digitata, L. japonica ), the species Macrocystis  pyrifera, Ascophyllum nodosum, Lesonia negrescens or 
species  of the genus Sargassum,  although all brown algae contain  alginate in different proportions reaching up to 
40% of  dry weight (Ertesvag and Valla, 19 98). A major advantage of alginate gel entrapment is that  immobilized cells 
do not suffer extreme physical –chemical  condition changes dur ing the immobilization process (Araujo and Andrade , 
1996). The polymer is  soluble in cold water and forms thermostable gels. Hertzberg and Jensen (1989) described a 
protocol  for immobilizing marine microalgae in alginate beads . Pane et al. (1998) immobilized Tetraselmis suecica  in 
Ca-alginate beads and compared the cellular growth of  immobilized an d free cells, finding tha t the chlorophyll content 
per cell in immobilized  cells was higher.  Moreno -Garrido et al.  (2005) checked the growth of immobilized cells and 
Ca-alginate  bead stability involving 11 marine  microalgal species, finding that the stability of beads can  also depend 
on the immobilized species.  Immobilization of the wallless  marine microalga Dunaliella tertiolecta  in alginate in 
hypersaline medium  produce significant amounts of glycerol (Grizeau and Navarro,  1986).   
Microencapsulation  has also been developed by co-use of alginate  and polylysine (Jen et al., 1996). Other 
microencapsulation  strategy for microalgae is  described by Joo et al. (2001),  a mixture of 2% sodium carboxymethyl 
cellulose, 2% CaCl 2 and microalgae is stirred in 0.8% sodium alginate till the  capsules are formed. After washing, the 
capsules are submerged  in 2% CaCl 2 for 20 min for the purpose of hardening.  
 
Conclusion  
 
 Currently, there are major advantages to ‘greener’ technologies. Immobilization  technology for microalgae is 
a prime candidate as a green  technology.  From a practical view, microalgal systems use solar energy and  need 
relatively small amounts of other inputs for operation. They  are relatively easy to handle on a large scale because 
they have  been used by compound producing industr ies for a very long time.  These systems produce no health 
hazards, are environmental  friendly , produce no secondary pollution, and their end products can be  converted to 
additional by -products (like fertilizers or biofuel) that  may further reduce costs. The compactness of these systems 
produces  less sludge and is smaller and simpler to maintain than large  fluidized beds.  There are still a number of J. Algal Biomass Utln .  2017, 8(1): 64 -70                            Micro  algal Immobilization T echniques

 technical aspects of this technology  that could be developed, such as improvement of the polymers  themselves  to 
create ‘‘alloys” of organic polymers by mixing different  polymer types to improve diffusion of effluents, development  of 
less stressing immobilization procedures for microalgae, and  optimizing selection of the proper polymer and the 
changes in metaboli sm of the  microalgae that it induces.
