In this work, adsorption of Ni(II) from aqueous solution to titanate nanotubes (TNTs) as a function of
various water quality parameters was investigated under ambient conditions. The results indicated thatthe adsorption of Ni(II) to TNTs was strongly dependent on pH and ionic strength. A positive effect ofhumic acid (HA)/fulvic acid (FA) on Ni(II) adsorption was found at pH < 6.0, whereas a negative effectwas observed at pH > 6.0. At low pH, the adsorption of Ni(II) was dominated by outer-sphere surfacecomplexation or ion exchange with Na
+/H+on TNT surfaces, whereas inner-sphere surface complexation
was the main adsorption mechanism at high pH. The TNTs are suitable material for the preconcentrationof Ni(II) from large volumes of aqueous solutions.

1. Introduction
The increasing levels of toxic heavy metals or radionuclides,
which have been discharged into the environment as industrialwastes, pose a serious threat to human health, living resources andecological systems. Among the potentially contaminants, nickelis one of the most widespread pollutants in the environment.It is generally regarded that the wastewater containing nickelis mainly derived from industrial production processes includ-ing mining, electrolysis, electroplating, batteries dyes metallurgy,pesticides, etc. [1].
63Ni(II) ( T1/2= 96 a), an important product of
the neutron activation of the reactor materials, is present in liq-uid wastes released from pressurized water from the nuclearpower reactors and is also widely used in research and medi-cal applications. The presence of nickel in drinking water abovethe permissible limit of 0.02 mg/L (WHO drinking-water qual-ity standards) can cause adverse health impacts such as anemia,diarrhea, encephalopathy, hepatitis and the dysfunction of cen-tral nervous system. For ecosystem stability and public healthsake, it is of great importance to remove nickel from wastewa-ters. Among most methods of wastewater management, sorptiontechnique has been widely used for the treatment of wastewa-ter and retention of nuclear waste due to its simplicity of design,high sorption efﬁciency and low cost. In Sweden, the Svensk Kärn-bränslehantering AB (SKB, the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste

xkwang@ipp.ac.cn (X. Wang).Management Co.) presents an R&D program every three years
to manage spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste [2].
The studies on the sorption of radionuclides have been exten-sively conducted. Many R&D programs and various results havebeen reported [3–8] . For the long-term performance assessment of
nuclear waste, it is of great signiﬁcance to obtain in-depth under-standing on the sorption mechanism of radionuclides at solid/waterinterfaces.
Since the innovative work of Kasuga et al. [9–11] , titanate nan-
otubes (TNTs) have been of particular research interest for theirpotential application as hydrogen sensors, catalyst supports, ion-exchange materials and superior sorbents due to their fascinatingmicrostructures and excellent physicochemical properties [12].I n
the past few years, various investigations have been conductedto study the adsorption potential of TNTs towards the removalof gas [13], organic dyes [14–17] , Ag(I) [18], Pb(II) [18–20] , Cu(II)
[18,21] and As(V) [22]. It was ﬁrst reported by Umek et al. [13]
that gaseous NO
2could be physically adsorbed on the surface of
TNTs by p yorbital of the oxygen atoms. Adsorption of organic
dyes on TNTs was studied by Lee et al. [14,15] , and they indicated
that the amount of Na(I) within TNT structure appears to domi-nate the adsorption potential of TNTs. Regarding the adsorption ofheavy metal by TNTs, An et al. [18] and Lin et al. [21] indicated
that TNTs showed high adsorption capacity for Cu(II), Pb(II), andAg(I), and the results revealed that a decrease in adsorption wasowing to the strengthening O–H bond and the intercalation of H(I)in TNT structure. However, these limited studies only focused onthe adsorption kinetic and thermodynamic of TNTs towards organicdyes and heavy metals and little attention has been paid to theadsorption characteristic of radionuclides onto TNTs.

Despite of the extensive studies on the adsorption of metal ions
[18–22] or organic compounds [14–17] on TNTs, according to our
literature survey, there is still little information with respect tothe inﬂuence of organic compounds on the adsorption of metalions. However, it should be noted that metal ions and organiccompounds exist simultaneously at many contaminated sites. Forexample, the presence of natural organic matter (NOM), such ashumic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA), may inﬂuence the fate ofmetal ions in natural environment. In our previous studies [23–26] ,
the effect of HA/FA on metal ion adsorption to minerals had beenextensively studied. It was generally found that the adsorption wasincreased at low pH values but decreased at high pH values. How-ever, the effect of HA/FA on metal ion adsorption to TNTs is stillscarce. Therefore, to better understand the practical application ofTNTs as a potential adsorbent in the wastewater management, itis greatly important to investigate the adsorption of metal ions toTNTs in the presence of HA/FA.
In this work, we investigated the adsorption of Ni(II) on TNTs
under various solution chemistry conditions. Ni(II) was selected asa model metal ion because of its extensive existence in water envi-ronment, and as a representative radionuclide because radionickelis one of most important radionuclides in nuclear waste. The objec-tives of this work are: (1) to study the adsorption of Ni(II) on TNTsunder various common conditions; (2) to discuss the adsorptionmechanism of Ni(II) on TNTs.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
All chemicals used in the experiments were purchased as ana-
lytical purity and used directly without any further puriﬁcation.All the reagents were prepared with Mill-Q water. HA and FAwere extracted from the soil of Hua-Jia county (Gansu Province,China) and were characterized in detail [27–29] . Cross-polarization
magic angle spinning (CPMAS)
13C NMR spectra of HA and FA
were divided into four chemical shift regions, i.e., 0–50 ppm,51–105 ppm, 106–160 ppm and 161–200 ppm. The four regionswere referred to as aliphatic, carbohydrate, aromatic, and carboxylregions. The percentage of the total intensity of each region wasestimated by integrating CPMAS
13C NMR spectra for each region.
The fractions of aromatic groups calculated by expressing aromaticC as percentage of the sum of aliphatic C (0–105 ppm) and aro-matic C (106–160 ppm) are tabulated in Table 1 . HA and FA have
also been characterized as a suite of 3 discrete acids with p K
aval-
ues listed in Table 2 . The concentrations of functional groups of HA
and FA determined by ﬁtting the potentiometric acid–base titra-tion data using FITEQL 3.1 are given also in Table 2 . In addition, the
weight-averaged molecular weights ( M
w) of dissolved HA and FAare evaluated according to the method of Chin et al. [30], and the
Mwvalues of dissolved HA and FA are 2108 and 1364, respectively.
The preparation and characterization of TNTs have been describedin detail in our previous study [31].
2.2. Batch adsorption procedures
All the experiments were carried out by using batch technique in
polyethylene centrifuge tubes under ambient conditions. The stocksuspension of TNTs and NaClO
4solution was pre-equilibrated for
24 h and then Ni(II) stock solution was added to achieve the desiredconcentrations of different components. The pH was adjusted todesired values by adding negligible volumes of 0.1 or 0.01 M HClO
4
or NaOH. After the suspensions were oscillated for 24 h, the solidand liquid phases were separated by centrifugation at 7788 ×g
for 30 min. To take into account of Ni(II) adsorption on tube wall,calibration curves were obtained separately under otherwise iden-tical conditions as the adsorption process but no TNTs. Based onthe obtained calibration curves, the amount of Ni(II) adsorbed onTNTs was calculated by subtracting the mass in the solution fromthe mass spiked. Radionuclide
63Ni was used in the experiments
as radiotracer. The concentration of radiotracer63Ni was ana-
lyzed by Liquid Scintillation counting using a Packard 3100 TR/ABLiquid Scintillation analyzer (PerkinElmer). The sorption percent-age (sorption % = ( C
0−Ceq)/C0×100%) and distribution coefﬁcient
(Kd=(C0−Ceq)/Ceq×V/m)o f63Ni(II) on TNTs were derived from the
initial concentration of Ni(II) ( C0), the equilibrium concentration
of Ni(II) ( Ceq), the mass of TNTs ( m) and the volume of the sus-
pension ( V). All experimental data were the average of triplicate
determinations and the relative errors were about 5%.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Effect of ionic strength
Fig. 1 shows the pH dependence of Ni(II) adsorption to TNTs
in 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 mol/L NaClO 4solutions, respectively. As
indicated in Fig. 1 , solution pH is an important factor to inﬂu-
ence the removal of Ni(II) from aqueous solution to TNTs. Theremoval of Ni(II) increases slowly at pH ranging from 2.0 to 4.0,then increases abruptly at pH 4.0–6.0, and at last maintains the highlevel with increasing pH at pH > 6.0. About 90% of Ni(II) is adsorbedon TNTs at pH > 6.0. It is well known that the species of Ni(II) inaqueous solution are important to Ni(II) sorption. The species ofNi(II) in aqueous solution are strongly dependent on pH values.Fig. 2 shows the relative distribution of Ni(II) species calculated
from the overall hydrolysis constants (Log K

[32]. It can be clearly found from Fig. 2 that Ni(II) presents in180 G. Sheng et al. / Chemical Engineering Journal 168 (2011) 178–182

the species of Ni2+, Ni(OH)+, Ni(OH) 20, Ni(OH) 3−and Ni(OH) 42−
at different pH values. At low pH values, Ni2+and Ni(OH)+are
the main species of Ni(II) in aqueous solution. Because of the pro-tonation reaction (i.e., ≡TiOH +H
+↔≡ TiOH+
2) on TNT surfaces,
the concentration of protonated sites ( ≡TiOH 2+) decreases with pH
increasing. Therefore, the removal of Ni2+and Ni(OH)+is difﬁcult
as a result of coulombic repulsion at pH range 2.0–4.0. However,at high pH values, the concentration of deprotonated sites ( ≡TiO
−)
increases with pH increasing because of the surface deprotonationreaction (i.e., ≡TiOH ↔≡TiO
−+H+). The deprotonated sites ( ≡TiO−)
are more available to retain Ni(II) ions and surface complexationbetween Ni
2+, Ni(OH)+and TNTs is facilitated, thus resulting in
sharp increase of Ni(II) sorption at pH 4.0–6.0.
Fig. 1 also demonstrates the inﬂuence of ionic strength on the
removal of Ni(II) from solution to TNTs. It is generally regarded thatClO
4−does not form complexes with Ni(II) in solution or on TNT
surfaces. The inﬂuence of NaClO 4concentration on Ni(II) sorption
is mainly contributed to the competition of H+/Na+with Ni(II) on
the surfaces of TNTs. It can be clearly seen that the removal of Ni(II)at pH < 6.0 is obviously inﬂuenced by ionic strength, while no dras-tic difference of Ni(II) sorption to TNTs is found at pH > 6.0 in thethree different solution concentrations of NaClO

strength effects on Ni(II) sorption is consistent with those reportedin the literatures [33,34] .8 7 6 5 4 3 220406080100Sorption(%)

Based on the triple-layer model, a possible equilibrium adsorp-
tion reaction of Ni(II) with the TNT surface can be expressed asfollows: (i) if Ni(II) ions react similarly to a background electrolytewith TNTs, then ion-pairs are formed at the /H9252-plane, on which the
adsorption process is nonspeciﬁc and the reaction product is anouter-sphere surface complex; (ii) if the adsorption of Ni(II) ions isvisualized as a chemically speciﬁc reaction, then the reaction can beconsidered as an inner-sphere coordination process. Ni(II) ions with1 and 2 mol of reactive surface hydroxyl of TNTs forms inner-spheremonodentate and bidentate surface complexes, respectively; (iii)if hydrate Ni(II) ions react with TNTs, inner-sphere and outer-sphere surface complexes can be formed, respectively [35,36] . The
background electrolyte concentration inﬂuences the thickness andinterface potential of the double layer, affecting the binding of theadsorbing species. Hayes and Leckie [37] proposed that the inﬂu-
ence of the background electrolyte on the adsorption reaction canbe applied to predict the adsorption reaction. /H9252-Plane adsorption
can be assumed to proceed when the background electrolyte easilyinﬂuences the adsorption reaction; otherwise, o-plane adsorptionmay occur. The results of this work suggest that Ni(II) participatesin a/H9252-plane complex reaction at low pH values, as the adsorption is
greatly affected by the /H9252-plane complex reaction of the background
electrolyte (i.e., Na
+and NO 3−). Meanwhile, Ni(II) participates in an
o-plane complex reaction at high pH values, without being affectedby the /H9252-plane complex reaction of the background electrolyte (i.e.,
Na
+and NO 3−). From the discussion mentioned above, we can draw
a conclusion that the pH- and ionic strength-dependent adsorptionof Ni(II) suggests that the removal of Ni(II) to TNTs is dominatedby ion exchange or outer-sphere surface complexation at pH < 6.0,whereas the pH-dependent and ionic strength-independent Ni(II)adsorption indicates that the removal of Ni(II) is mainly due toinner-sphere surface complexation at pH > 6.0 [33,34,38,39] .
3.2. Effect of cation
Fig. 3 shows the removal of Ni(II) from aqueous solution to TNTs
as a function of pH in 0.01 mol/L LiClO
4, NaClO 4and KClO 4solutions,
respectively. The removal of Ni(II) to TNTs is clearly affected bycations in the TNT suspension. One can see that the removal percentof Ni(II) to TNTs at pH < 6.0 is in the following order: Li
+>N a+>K+,
which indicates that cations can change the surface properties ofTNTs and thus inﬂuences the adsorption of Ni(II) onto TNTs. Cationsin TNT suspension will compete for interaction with the surface ofTNTs, and Ni(II) has higher charge and higher afﬁnity to the surfaceof TNTs than that of the alkali metal ions. As support for this compe-G. Sheng et al. / Chemical Engineering Journal 168 (2011) 178–182 181

tition principle, the order of Ni(II) uptake under the same pH value
is found to be the lowest for K+and the highest for Li+, which is the
order of their radii of hydration: K+= 2.32, Na+= 2.76 and Li+= 3.4 ˚A
[33,34] . The adsorption of Ni(II) to TNTs can be considered as a
competition of Ni(II) with Li+(or Na+,K+) at the TNT surfaces. The
radius of Li+is larger than those of the other two cations and thus
the inﬂuence of Li+on Ni(II) adsorption to TNTs is smaller than those
of Na+and K+. However, at pH > 6.0, no drastic difference of Ni(II)
sorption to TNTs in LiClO 4, NaClO 4and KClO 4solutions is observed,
which may be attributed to the inner-sphere surface complexationor surface precipitates at high pH values as mentioned in the abovesection. Hu et al. [33,34] investigated the effect of Li
+,N a+and K+on
the sorption of Ni(II) in goethite/water and illite/water suspensions,respectively, and similar results were also found.
3.3. Effect of anion
Fig. 4 demonstrates the adsorption curves of Ni(II) onto TNTs
as a function of pH in 0.01 mol/L NaClO
4, NaNO 3and NaCl solu-
tions, respectively. The results suggest that the anions affect Ni(II)adsorption onto TNTs obviously at pH < 6.0. The removal percentof Ni(II) from aqueous solution to TNTs is the lowest in NaCl solu-tion and the highest in NaClO
4solution under the same pH values.
This phenomenon can be ascribed to the factors that: (I) Cl−and
NO3−can form soluble complexes with Ni(II) ions in solution (e.g.
Ni(II)Cl x(2−x)−, Ni(II) (NO 3)x(2−x)−), while ClO 4−does not form solu-
ble complexes with Ni(II) in solution. Ni(II) has the highest afﬁnityto Cl
−and the lowest afﬁnity to ClO 4−; (II) idiocratic adsorption of
Cl−to TNT surface is a little easier than that of NO 3−and ClO 4−,
and Cl−adsorption on TNT surface alters the surface properties of
TNTs and decreases the availability of binding sites for Ni(II); (III)the inorganic acid radicals radium sequence is Cl
−<N O 3−< ClO 4−,
the smaller radium inorganic acid radicals can take up more ionicexchange sites and lead to the decline of Ni(II) adsorption on TNTs[33,34] .
3.4. Effect of HA/FA
Fig. 5 shows the pH dependent of Ni(II) adsorption onto TNTs in
the absence and presence of HA/FA. A positive effect of HA/FA onNi(II) adsorption onto TNTs is observed at low pH values, while anegative effect of HA/FA on Ni(II) adsorption to TNTs is observed athigh pH values. Fig. 6 shows the adsorption of HA and FA to TNTs as
a function of pH. It can be obviously found that about 90% of HA/FAis adsorbed on TNT surface at pH < 6.0, and then the adsorption8 7 6 5 4 3 2406080100Sorption(%)

decreases with increasing pH. Ghosh et al. [40] and Yang and Xing
[41] had determined the zeta potential of HA and FA as a function
of pH, respectively, and it was found that both HA and FA were neg-atively charged in the pH range of 3.0–10.0. The observations arein agreement with previous potentiometric titration results [27].
Therefore, at low pH values, the negatively charged HA/FA can beeasily adsorbed on the positively charged surfaces of TNTs becauseof the electrostatic attraction. The strong complexation betweensurface adsorbed HA/FA and Ni(II) leads to the enhancement ofNi(II) adsorption to TNTs at low pH values. However, at high pHvalues, the adsorption of the negatively charged HA/FA on the neg-atively charged surfaces of TNTs becomes difﬁcult because of theelectrostatic repulsion. Thus the HA/FA in solution forms solublecomplexes of HA/FA–Ni(II) in solution, and thereby reduces Ni(II)adsorption to TNTs.
It is also seen from Fig. 5 that the inﬂuence of FA on the
removal of Ni(II) is a little stronger than that of HA at the wholepH range when the mass concentrations of HA and FA are thesame. Although the samples of HA and FA were extracted fromthe same soil samples and both of them contain functional groupssuch as carboxyl, amine and phenolic, the proportions and conﬁg-urations of these functional groups and surface sites density aredifferent. As is illustrated in Table 2 , the surface site density of
FA (i.e., 2.71 ×10
−2mol/g) is much higher than that of HA (i.e.,182 G. Sheng et al. / Chemical Engineering Journal 168 (2011) 178–182
6.46×10−3mol/g), which can provide more available surface sites
for the binding of Ni(II). Therefore, it is reasonable that FA has astronger effect on Ni(II) removal than HA at the whole pH range.
4. Conclusion
Batch technique was adopted to investigate the adsorption of
Ni(II) from aqueous solutions onto TNTs as a function of variousenvironmental factors such as pH, ionic strength, coexisting elec-trolyte ions and humic substances under ambient conditions. Theadsorption increases with increasing pH values at pH < 6.0, andthen maintains high level at pH > 6.0. The adsorption of Ni(II) isdependent on ionic strength and foreign ions at low pH values, andindependent of these factors at high pH values. The presence ofHA/FA enhances the adsorption of Ni(II) at pH < 6.0, while reducesNi(II) adsorption at pH > 6.0. By integrating all the above-mentionedanalysis together, one can conclude that the adsorption of Ni(II)on TNTs is dominated by ion exchange or outer-sphere surfacecomplexation at low pH values, and by inner-sphere surface com-plexation at high pH values. Considering the accessibility and lowcost of TNTs, one can conclude that this material has a great applica-tion potential for the cost-effective disposal of Ni(II)-contaminatedwastewaters. Based on the results noted for Ni(II), TNTs may also besuitable for the removal of other heavy metals and radionuclides.Hence, more investigations on the adsorption properties of TNTstowards various environmental pollutants are ongoing in our labo-ratory so as to have a more thorough view of the possibility of usingTNTs as a promising material for wastewater management.
