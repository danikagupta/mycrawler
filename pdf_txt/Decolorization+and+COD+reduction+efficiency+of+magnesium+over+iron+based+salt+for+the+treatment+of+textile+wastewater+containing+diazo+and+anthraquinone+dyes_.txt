Abstract—Magnesium chloride, though cost wise roughly 
same as of ferrous sulphate, is less commonly used coagulant in 
comparison to the ferrous sulphate for the treatmen t of wastewater. 
The present study was conducted to investigate the comparative 
effectiveness of ferrous sulphate (FeSO 4.7H2O) as iron based salt 
and magnesium chloride (MgCl 2) as magnesium based salt in terms 
of decolorization and chemical oxygen demand (COD) r eduction 
efficiency of textile wastewater. The coagulants we re evaluated for 
synthetic textile wastewater containing two diazo d yes namely 
Reactive Black 5 (RB5) and Congo Red (CR) and one 
anthraquinone dye as Disperse Blue 3 (DB3), in seven  possible 
equi-ratio combinations. Other chemical constituent s that are 
normally released from different textile processing  units were also 
added to replicate a practical scenario. From this study, 
MgCl2/Lime was found to be a superior coagulant system a s 
compared to FeSO 4.7H2O/Lime, FeSO 4.7H2O/NaOH and 
MgCl2/NaOH.

I. INTRODUCTION  
EXTILE industry is one of the leading contributors to 
many Asian economies including India, as it contrib utes 
nearly fourteen percent of the total industrial pro duction. It 
is also one of the biggest consumers of potable wat er as well 
as the chemical additives during various steps of t extile 
processing. The unused chemical additives are disch arged as 
effluent from various units in the form of wastewat er. 
Dyeing and finishing stages are the major producer of 
wastewater with complex characteristics such as str ong 
color due to the presence of residual dyes, high pH , large 
amount of suspended solids (SS) and high chemical o xygen 
demand (COD). Presence of very low concentrations o f 
these dyes can be highly visible and hence, the rec eiving 
water bodies not only become aesthetically unaccept able but 
also the discharge of these effluents can be carcin ogenic, 
mutagenic and generally very harmful to the environ ment 
[1]-[3]. Therefore, textile wastewater should effec tively be 
treated to meet the legal as well as the aesthetic standards 
before discharging it into the environment or munic ipal 
wastewater treatment plant. 
The conventional textile wastewater treatment 
technologies are normally biological, physicochemic al 
and/or advanced oxidation processes. Biological pro cesses 
are generally cheap, simple and environmental frien dly, 
which can be used effectively to remove the   biode gradable

to less biodegradable nature of the textile dyes. A lmost all 
advanced oxidation processes are associated with hi gh cost 
of operation and may produce the toxic by-products.  The 
main advantage of conventional physicochemical proc esses 
like chemical coagulation and flocculation, is the 
decolorization of wastewater takes place by removal  of dye 
molecule from the textile wastewater, and not by th e partial 
decomposition of dyes, which can lead to an even mo re 
potentially harmful and toxic aromatic compound [4] , which 
can be resistant to degradation even under aerobic 
conditions [5], [6]. Sludge production is a major l imitation 
associated with the chemical treatment. However, fe asibility 
of sludge disposal makes it one of the most appropr iate 
technology for the treatment of textile effluents. 
A number of studies had been carried out for the 
treatment of textile wastewater containing a single  dye or 
mixture of dyes of the same class with only distill ed water 
for the preparation of synthetic textile wastewater  [7]-[9]. 
Very limited studies have been reported on chemical  
treatment of synthetic textile wastewater containin g majority 
of the chemical additives that are used in textile industry 
during different steps of textile processing. To th e best of 
our knowledge, no study has been observed in the li terature 
on the treatment of textile wastewater containing d iverse 
toxic chemicals that are released from textile indu stries 
along with the mixture of widely used diazo and 
anthraquinone dyes. Also, very limited reported dat a are 
available on the effectiveness of iron and magnesiu m based 
coagulants along with the lime as coagulant aid on the 
quantity and nature of sludge production [10]. Ther efore, the 
present study was focused to investigate the effect iveness of 
MgCl2 as well as FeSO 4.7H2O as coagulants and lime as 
coagulant aid for the decolorization and COD reduct ion of 
synthetic textile wastewater containing new generat ion 
diazo and anthraquinone dyes such as Reactive Black  5, 
Congo Red and Disperse Blue 3 respectively, along w ith the 
various other chemical additives that are used in t he textile 
industry during textile processing. The study was f ocused at 
evaluating comparative effect of pH and coagulant d osage 
for color removal efficiency along with the amount of 
sludge production for each of the combinations when  
optimum pH adjustment was carried out either by sod ium 
hydroxide or by lime.

Synthetic textile wastewater was prepared as per th e 
reported chemical constituents of real textile wast ewater 
[11]-[13], with a total dye concentration of 200 mg /L (Table 
1). The total dye concentration was prepared either  with a 
single dye, or two and three mixed dye solutions in  the equal 
ratio along with the various chemical additives. Wa stewaters 
were prepared using three commercial dyes: Reactive  Black 
5 (RB5), Congo Red (CR) and Disperse Blue 3 (DB3) i n the 
tap water. The maximum absorbance wavelength ( max) for 
each dye wastewater was used to measure the absorba nce of 
respective treated wastewater. Color content of the  
wastewater containing a mixture of dyes in differen t 
combinations, was determined by taking sum of the 
absorbencies measured at 591, 502 and 638 nm for th at 
particular combination [14]. The characteristics of  the 
synthetic textile wastewater were: COD = 1980±20 mg /L, 
pH = 10.5±0.2, Abs(1731) = Abs(591) + Abs(502) + 
Abs(638) = 2.3992 for wastewater containing RB5, CR , and 
DB3; Abs(1093) = Abs(591) + Abs(502) = 2.4971 for 
wastewater containing RB5 and CR; Abs(1140) = Abs(5 02) 
+ Abs(638) = 0.7638 for wastewater containing CR an d 
DB3; Abs(1229) = Abs(591) + Abs(638) = 2.4231 for 
wastewater containing RB5 and DB3; Abs(591) = 3.115 4 
for wastewater containing RB5; Abs(502) = 0.9264 fo r 
wastewater containing CR; Abs(638) = 0.3540 for 
wastewater containing DB3. 
The optimum pH and optimum coagulant dosage require d 
for efficient color removal were determined by perf orming 
Jar test. Beakers of volume 1 L, containing 500 mL of 
wastewater were used for the coagulation experiment s. 
Coagulant was added and mixed for 3 min under rapid  
mixing at 80 rpm. The solution was then mixed at sl ow 
flocculation for 15 min at 30 rpm. After sedimentat ion for 
20 min, supernatants from the top of the beaker wer e taken 
for the analysis. Color of the samples was determin ed by 
absorbance measurement using UV-VIS Spectrophotomet er (Perkin-Elmeyer, Lambda 25). An aliquot of filtrate  was 
then centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 10 min to obtain a  clear 
solution. The pH of the liquid was then adjusted to  about 
neutral for measuring the absorbance of the liquid.  The 
COD was analysed as per closed reflux colorimetric method 
after digestion of the filtrates in COD reactor (Mo del DRB 
200, HACH, USA) and then absorbance measurement was  
carried out by COD spectrophotometer at 600 nm (Mod el 
DR 2800, HACH, USA). COD standard curve was 
developed based on the absorbencies. The normalised  
equation  /

which was further used for COD measurement. The

Where A ut and A t are the absorbencies of untreated and 
treated wastewater sample, respectively. 
Sludge production (in terms of settled sludge volum e and 
suspended solids) was also measured at optimized 
conditions for all the combinations using MgCl 2 and 
FeSO4.7H2O both. All the methods used for the analysis of 
wastewater characteristics and sludge production we re as 
per Standard Methods [15] and performed at room 
temperature (25±5˚C).  
 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
A. Determination of optimum pH for chemical 
coagulation of synthetic textile wastewater 
The subsequent experiments were designed to determi ne 
the optimum pH for all the combinations of syntheti c textile 
wastewater that allowed for maximum decolorization and 
COD reduction. Destabilisation of all the combinati ons was 
examined at various pH conditions (6, 8, 9, 10, 11,  12, 12.5) 
maintaining 1000 mg/L of coagulant dose for both th e 
coagulants. NaOH and H 2SO4 were used to control the pH 
for this purpose. As pH affects the molecular struc ture of the 
dyes, which changes the absorbance of the solutions  [16], 
hence pH of the untreated wastewater as well as tre ated 
wastewater was adjusted to neutral before measuring  the 
absorbance for evaluating the percentage of color r emoval. 
Percentage color removal increased with the increas e in pH 
from 6.0 to 11.0 or 6.0 to 12.0. For the combinatio ns of 
textile wastewater containing i) CR, ii) DB3, and i ii) 
CR+DB3, the optimal pH was found to be 11.0, wherea s for 
the rest of the four combinations, it was 12.0. For  all the 
combinations, percentage of color removal was found  to be 
decreasing at pH greater than the optimum pH. These  results 
are in the good agreement with the findings reporte d by 
Arslan and Balcioglu [17] and Tan et al. [18]. Trea tment 
efficiency in terms of percentage color removal and  COD 
reduction at optimum pH for various combinations of  dye 
wastewater has been summarised in Table II.

The improvement of coagulation efficiency at increa sing 
pH can be explained by the facts that, a) metal ion s are 
easily hydrolysed in alkaline conditions and form 
precipitable hydroxide; b) the aggregation of selec ted dyes 
takes place at specific alkaline pH and hence, redu ction in 
the solubility. The structure of precipitable hydro xide 
provides large surface area for the adsorptive remo val of 
aggregated chemical dyes. At pH beyond 11.0 (for th ree 
combinations) and pH 12.0 (for the rest four combin ations), 
the results show lower removal rate. This phenomeno n is 
probably due to the increase in the solubility of h ydroxide 
precipitate. The highest COD reduction was also obs erved at 
optimum pH for all the combinations. This might be due to 
the fact that starch and sucrose, which are the maj or sources 
of COD in the textile wastewater, would have been 
aggregated and removed along with the chemical dyes . At 
optimum pH, excellent reduction in color and consid erable 
reduction in COD was observed for the wastewater 
containing individual dye as well as the mixture of  different 
dyes. 
B.  Determination of optimum coagulant dosage  
The optimum dosage of coagulants for all the 
combinations was determined by varying the coagulan t 
dosage and maintaining the optimum pH either with N aOH 
or with lime  individually. It has already been established that 
the lime can be used to increase the pH as well as it can 
work as coagulant/coagulant aid, since it is capabl e of 
giving a certain level of color removal [19]. There fore, the 
present study was also conducted to evaluate the ef fect of 
lime on the color removal and COD reduction efficie ncy. 
Coagulation experiments were carried out using MgCl 2 and 
FeSO4.7H2O either with NaOH or with lime. 
Color removal as a function of coagulant dosage for  all 
the combinations is shown in Fig. 1. It was observe d in 
almost all the cases that percentage color removal increases 
with the increase in coagulant dosage. Above 99% co lor 
removal efficiency was observed at 1000 mg/L of MgC l2 for the wastewater containing RB5 when lime was used to  
maintain the optimum pH. Coagulant combinations suc h as 
FeSO4.7H2O/Lime and MgCl 2/NaOH were also found to be 
effective which gave more than 96% color removal 
efficiency at a coagulant dosage of 1200 mg/L. Howe ver, 
considerable decrease in color removal efficiency o f 88.6% 
was observed at 1200 mg/L of FeSO 4.7H2O dose, when 
NaOH was used to maintain the optimum pH (Fig. 1a).   
MgCl2 in case of textile wastewater containing CR had 
been observed to produce excellent color removal of  above 
99% at a coagulant dosage of 1300 mg/L, when optimu m 
pH was maintained by lime. Approximately, 95% color  
removal efficiency was observed with FeSO 4.7H2O as well 
as with MgCl 2 at a coagulant dosage of 1300 mg/L when 
optimum pH was maintained by NaOH. However, 
considerable improvement by 3% in color removal 
efficiency for the wastewater containing CR was obs erved at 
the same dosage of 1300 mg/L of FeSO 4.7H2O when lime 
was used to maintain the optimum pH (Fig. 1b).  
Significant improvement in decolorization was also 
observed for the wastewater containing DB3 for all the 
coagulant combinations but comparatively at lesser 
coagulant dosage of 1200 mg/L. Excellent color remo val 
efficiency of 99.8% was observed for MgCl 2 at 1400 mg/L 
when lime was used to maintain the optimum pH (Fig.  1c). 
Adjustment of optimum pH with lime over NaOH again 
showed the improvement in color removal efficiency.  
Higher treatment efficiency for the synthetic texti le 
wastewater containing DB3 as compared to the previo us two 
combinations might be due to the fact that disperse  dyes are 
less soluble as compared to the other two dyes, and  hence 
tends to aggregate at alkaline pH very easily. This  
observation is in good agreement with the findings reported 
by Arslan and Balcioglu [17], where ferrous sulphat e was 
used for treatment of the dye bath spent containing  a 
mixture of disperse dyes. 
Color removal above 86% and 94%, respectively was 
achieved at 2000 mg/L of FeSO 4.7H2O and MgCl 2 dosage 
for the wastewater containing RB5 and CR together, when 
NaOH was used for pH adjustment. However, considera ble 
improvement in the color removal efficiency of the order 
96.5% and 98.6%, respectively had been observed at the 
lesser dosage of 1800 mg/L of FeSO 4.7H2O and MgCl 2, 
when lime was used for attaining the optimum pH (Fi g. 1d).  
Excellent color removal efficiencies of 99.5% and 9 7.1% 
were obtained at 1200 mg/L of MgCl 2 and FeSO 4.7H2O 
respectively, for the wastewater containing CR and DB3 
together, when lime was used to maintain the optimu m pH. 
Like all other cases, in this case also treatment e fficiency in 
terms of color removal was significantly higher tha n that of 
the observed efficiency at the same dosage of MgCl 2 and 
FeSO4.7H2O when optimum pH was adjusted with NaOH 
(Fig. 1e). 
More than 99% color removal efficiency was obtained  for 
the wastewater containing RB5 and DB3 together at 1 200 
mg/L of MgCl 2 when lime was used to maintain the 
optimum pH. This observed color removal efficiency was 
considerably higher than the other coagulant combin ations 
such as MgCl 2/NaOH, FeSO 4.7H2O/NaOH and 
FeSO4.7H 2O/Lime even at a very high dosage of 1800 mg/L 
(Fig. 1f).  
International Journal of Chemical and Biological Engineering 6 2012
118Color removal efficiency of 98.3% and 97% had been 
achieved at 1400 mg/L of MgCl 2 and FeSO 4.7H2O 
respectively, for the wastewater containing RB5, CR  and 
DB3 together, and when lime was used for optimum pH  
adjustment. However, when NaOH was used to adjust t he 
optimum pH, decolorization efficiency of 96.5% was 
observed at the same dosage of MgCl 2 (Fig. 1g).

Based upon the above experimental results, it can b e said 
that DB3 (disperse dye) removal took place comparat ively 
at the lesser dosage of coagulants as compared to t he other 
reactive and direct dyes. This can be attributed by  the fact 
that there might be a competitive binding of dye mo lecules 
with the coagulant according to their solubility 
characteristics. Faster and efficient binding upon disperse 
dyes may be linked to its least soluble nature. It was also 
observed that the synthetic textile wastewater cont aining CR 
and DB3 can be efficiently treated at a lower dosag e of 
coagulants as compared to other combinations. Coagu lation 
efficiency of MgCl 2/NaOH was also found to be promising

119FeSO4.7H2O/NaOH and FeSO 4.7H2O/Lime for all the 
combinations of synthetic textile wastewater. Furth er, more 
than 99% color removal efficiency was observed for almost 
all the combinations of wastewater at only 1200 mg/ L of 
MgCl2 with lime. Based upon the results of this study, 
MgCl2 along with the lime can be proposed as the best 
coagulant combination for decolorizing textile wast ewater. 
Similar trends of COD reduction were observed with 
increasing coagulant dosage as obtained in case of color 
removal for all the combinations of synthetic texti le 
wastewater using both FeSO 4.7H2O and MgCl 2 coagulant 
combinations (Fig. 2).  A maximum of 63.1% COD 
reduction was observed at the optimum coagulant dos age of 
1400 mg/L MgCl 2 with lime for the wastewater containing 
all three dyes together (Fig. 2f). More than 50% CO D 
reduction was obtained in case of FeSO 4.7H2O with lime for 
remaining combinations of synthetic textile wastewa ter as 
shown in Fig. 2. Comparatively, FeSO 4.7H2O/Lime was 
observed as the better coagulant than MgCl 2/Lime for COD 
reduction. This can be explained by the fact that t he 
precipitation of FeSO 4.7H2O at very alkaline condition 
forms insoluble Fe(III) hydroxide flocs. These floc s are 
instrumental in leading to sweep coagulation mechan ism in 
the presence of Ca(OH) 2 and thereby results in better COD 
reduction than that of other coagulation mechanisms  such as 
charge neutralization and adsorption, which is norm ally a 
governing coagulation/flocculation mechanism in cas e of 
MgCl2. Further, COD reduction capability of MgCl 2/Lime 
was found to be lying in between FeSO 4.7H2O/Lime and 
MgCl2/NaOH for all the combinations of textile wastewate r 
except the synthetic textile wastewater containing all three 
dyes together.

C. Effects of lime  dosage on color and COD reduction 
As it was observed in almost all the above experime nts 
that the color removal efficiency improves when lim e was 
used either with FeSO 4.7H2O or with MgCl 2 for adjusting 
the optimum pHs instead of NaOH, hence, it indicate s that 
lime alone as coagulant/coagulant aid can give a ce rtain 
degree of color as well as COD reduction for treatm ent of 
textile wastewater.  Therefore, treatment efficienc y of lime  
alone as a coagulant was investigated for all the a bove 
combinations. For all the combinations, 800 mg/L li me 
dosage was found to be sufficient to attain the opt imum pH, 
which produced 22.3% – 58.6% color removal and 17.8 % - 
53.5% COD reduction for different combinations of 
wastewater used in this study. The results of the p resent study are in good agreement with the findings repor ted by 
Georgiou et al. [20], who studied the effect of lim e on the 
color and COD reduction of real textile wastewater.  
However, considering the very high quantity and vol ume of 
sludge generation and very low degree of decoloriza tion 
efficiency than that of the appreciable range, lime  as a 
coagulant alone cannot be recommended for decoloriz ation 
of textile wastewater. 
D.  Sludge production 
The amount and characteristics of the sludge produc ed 
during coagulation/ flocculation depends upon the t ype of 
coagulant used and the operating conditions [21]. T herefore, 
sludge production was measured at optimized pH and at 
optimum coagulant dosage for all the combinations. It was 
measured based upon the volume occupied by the floc s in 
500 mL of sample volume after settling for 1h in th e Imhoff 
cone as well as the suspended solids concentration after 
separation of flocs from the treated wastewater wit h the help 
of filtration and the subsequent drying at 105˚C fo r 1h. For 
almost all the combinations, volume of sludge produ ced was 
comparatively less when NaOH was used for pH adjust ment 
with both the coagulants (Fig. 3). The maximum slud ge 
production of 110 mL settled sludge/500 mL and 50 m L 
settled sludge/500 mL of sample were observed in ca se of 
FeSO4.7H2O/NaOH and MgCl 2/NaOH respectively, for the 
wastewater containing RB5 and DB3 together. However , a 
maximum of 120 mL settled sludge/500 mL and 56mL 
settled sludge/500 mL were observed in case of 
FeSO4.7H2O/Lime and MgCl 2/Lime for the wastewater 
containing CR and RB5, respectively. Marginally hig her 
sludge production when lime was used as pH adjuster  can be 
attributed by the fact that the lime is sparingly s oluble in 
water and therefore, it introduced suspended solids  when 
used as coagulant aid. Further, it can also be noti ced from 
the Fig. 3, that the sludge production was signific antly less 
when MgCl 2 was used as the coagulant. Maximum 50 mL 
settled sludge/500 mL and 56 mL settled sludge/500 mL of 
sample were observed for the wastewater containing RB5 
when pH was adjusted with NaOH and lime, respective ly. 
Significantly reduced sludge production using MgCl 2 as a 
coagulant may be explained by the fact that it show s very 
high adsorption for the dyes and other chemical add itives 
and produces more compact sludge as compare to the 
FeSO4.7H2O. Only 25 mL settled sludge/500 mL and 35 mL 
settled sludge/500 mL of sample were observed for t he 
wastewater containing CR when pH was adjusted with 
NaOH and lime, respectively. This might be due to t he 
better adsorption of direct dyes on the magnesium h ydroxide 
precipitates as compare to the other types of dyes.

Almost reverse trend was observed during measuremen t 
of suspended solids in the case where FeSO 4.7H2O was used 
as a coagulant. The maximum suspended solids of 192 8 
mg/L and 4019 mg/L were observed for the wastewater  
containing RB5 in case of FeSO 4.7H2O/NaOH and 
MgCl2/Lime, respectively. Minimum suspended solids of 
862 mg/L and 281 mg/L were observed for the wastewa ter 
containing CR in case of FeSO 4.7H2O/NaOH and 
MgCl2/NaOH, respectively. This can be related with the 
characteristics of wastewater as well as the coagul ant and 
can be explained as: (i) the wastewater containing RB5 and 
DB3 produces better quality (in terms of settleabil ity) flocs 
as compared to that of the wastewater containing CR . (ii) 
MgCl2 shows better surface adsorption than that of 
FeSO4.7H2O. The results of the present study are in good 
agreement with the findings reported by Bidhendi et  al. [10]. 
E.  Analysis of spectrogram and color removal 
mechanism of the coagulants 
Spectral analysis and investigation of color remova l 
mechanisms were performed for wastewater containing  
RB5, CR and DB3 dyes. All the three combination fol lowed 
almost the same trends for all the four coagulant s ystems 
(FeSO 4.7H2O/NaOH, FeSO 4.7H2O/Lime, MgCl 2/NaOH, and 
MgCl2/Lime). Therefore, wastewater containing RB5 
against FeSO 4.7H2O/Lime and MgCl 2/Lime were selected to 
explain the spectrogram and color removal mechanism . The 
spectral analysis was examined on untreated and tre ated 
wastewater at optimized condition of pH and coagula nt dose 
(shown in the Fig. 1a). The results are shown as th e curve 
"a" for untreated wastewater and "c" for treated wa stewater, 
respectively in Fig. 4(i) and Fig. 4(ii). It was fo und that the 
wastewater after treatment did not show any distinc tive dye 
peaks in the visible wavelength range from 400 to 7 00 nm in 
both the cases. This indicates that the dye from wa stewater 
was transferred into the hydroxide precipitate obta ined by 
coagulation-flocculation. Further, this precipitate  was 
filtered and acidified to the neutral pH to convert  into the 
solution. The filtrate is then analysed by spectrop hotometer, 
and the results are shown as the curve "b" in Fig. 4(i) and 
Fig. 4(ii). It can be seen that the shapes of curve  "a" and "b" 
appear to be almost similar and also the peaks have  been 
observed to form at the same wavelength for both th e cases.  
The color of neutralised solution was same as the 
untreated wastewater but absorbance value was less.  This 
might be due to the fact that the complete conversi on of the 
precipitate into the solution by acidification upto  neutral pH 
is almost impossible. Hence, it can be said that th e removal of color by coagulation was merely a physical pheno menon. 
There was no chemical change of dye molecules befor e, and 
after the coagulation as both the peaks have been f ound at 
the same wavelength for "a" and "b". The analysis i s in good 
agreement with the observation reported by Gao et a l. [19].

conditions using (i) FeSO 4.7H2O/Lime and (ii) MgCl 2/Lime 
 
On the basis of the findings of this study, color r emoval 
mechanisms of ferrous sulphate and magnesium chlori de 
can be described as: (i) the metal ions from the co agulants 
get converted into their insoluble metal hydroxides  at pH 
greater than 11.0, (ii) these complex and insoluble  structures 
of hydroxides provide a large adsorptive surface ar ea and 
positive superficial charge leading to adsorption a nd charge 
neutralization, (iii) finally, due to the presence of 
bicarbonate ions, lime reacts to form calcium carbo nate 
precipitates, which remove dyes through the sweepin g flocs 
mechanism [22]. Therefore, it can be said that the removal 
of color using ferrous sulphate and magnesium chlor ide as 
coagulant and lime as coagulant aid takes place 
predominantly by adsorption and charge neutralizati on 
along with the sweep flocculation principle. 
 
IV. CONCLUSIONS  
It can be inferred that the decolorization and COD 
reduction efficiency of coagulants significantly de pends 
upon the pH of wastewater. Magnesium based salt app eared 
to be the efficient coagulant over iron based salt.  Further, 
MgCl2 in combination with lime  was proven to be superior 
over the other coagulants for decolorization and CO D 
reduction of textile wastewater. In the present stu dy, a 0255075100125150Settled sludge volume

122maximum of more than 99% decolorization efficiency and 
63% COD reduction efficiency was observed for treat ing 
synthetic textile wastewaters containing a total 20 0 mg/L of 
selected diazo and anthraquinone dyes along with ot her 
chemical additives by using MgCl 2/Lime as coagulants.  
Reduced sludge production and excellent color remov al 
makes MgCl 2/Lime a novel and attractive coagulant system, 
especially for the textile wastewater having high o riginal 
pH. Hence, MgCl 2/Lime may be recommended as an 
efficient coagulant system for the treatment of tex tile 
wastewater, which removes dyes by the dual mechanis ms of 
adsorption and charge neutralization along with the  sweep 
flocculation. Since, this system can reduce a maxim um 
COD of approximately 60%, the remaining COD will be  
more than that of the safe discharge standards set by the 
Environmental Pollution Authority of different coun tries. 
Therefore, the secondary treatment is required to t ake care 
of the rest of the organic matters to meet the safe  discharge 
standards.
